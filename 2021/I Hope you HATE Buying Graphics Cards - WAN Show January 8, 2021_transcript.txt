[0.00 --> 6.72]  that's not what i meant to do at all okay oh bollocks sorry i'm moving you a little bit
[6.72 --> 14.48]  because you're actually a little bit too high oh shoot has it started it's starting
[15.92 --> 21.52]  welcome to the man show ladies and gentlemen we have got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[21.52 --> 26.16]  and hope that you enjoy it and i when i say hope i mean hope because
[26.16 --> 32.32]  like i don't have anything objective that would make me think that you're going to enjoy any of
[32.32 --> 40.40]  this it's all bad it's all bad news today people enjoy bad news though sometimes nvidia rtx 3080 max
[40.40 --> 51.92]  q could be 74 slower than a desktop version of the same card that is that would put it in line not
[51.92 --> 60.88]  with last gen's flagship but the one before that in other news gpus the desktop kind that is highly
[60.88 --> 67.28]  performant are about to get much more expensive thanks to trump administration tariffs womp womp
[68.56 --> 76.72]  just just one more hey how you doing on the way out what else we got luke it was only a matter of time
[76.72 --> 81.52]  we saw it sort of happen with oculus and now we're seeing it happen with whatsapp whatsapp is going to
[81.52 --> 89.28]  start compulsory information sharing with facebook and also there's a rumor that some switch modders
[89.28 --> 96.88]  found evidence of a switch pro coming up which will be able to do 4k in docked mode 4k in docked mode
[96.88 --> 103.36]  wow wow what i want to know is where's 120 hertz in docked mode and you know what else i want to know
[103.36 --> 108.72]  where's the intro where's it at oh yes oh wait oh oh it's actually not working
[108.72 --> 118.48]  oh that's awkward um uh oh geez oh geez oh geez luke uh am i the one that does the squeeze i
[118.48 --> 122.96]  actually don't remember that's insane how many times have i watched this we're good we're good
[122.96 --> 129.76]  we're good we're good we're good cool nice all right i found it the intro is missing carmen san diego
[129.76 --> 146.24]  i don't think my children are a lover know like what the heck a carmen san diego is where in the
[146.24 --> 153.60]  world is carmen san diego okay you're probably too young to know the tv show though i think i played a
[153.60 --> 160.88]  game yeah yeah yeah the game is like the og like carmen san diego ness but there was a tv show it was
[160.88 --> 169.04]  like if i recall correctly it was like a a cheesy kind of a game show type thing but like for kids
[169.68 --> 175.12]  so instead of like having like a daily double like jeopardy thing you would like find clues or something
[175.12 --> 182.80]  i i honestly have almost no memories of it i just remember the the phrase of where in the world is
[182.80 --> 189.04]  carmen san diego and i remember her like running away from someone and that's it that's all i remember
[189.04 --> 195.36]  it was so long ago whoa i played it at my like cousin's house there is a currently running
[195.36 --> 206.32]  carmen san diego tv series on netflix it's animated what what what timeline am i on it's just bringing
[206.32 --> 214.32]  everything back like honestly though what is even going on right now that is hilarious yeah you know
[214.32 --> 220.72]  apparently netflix is doing a elder scrolls tv series seriously okay that shouldn't surprise me
[220.72 --> 226.80]  that much especially 150 million dollar budget per season wow i mean after the success they had with
[226.80 --> 231.44]  the witcher that shouldn't be that much of a that shouldn't be that much of a surprise well you know
[231.44 --> 236.88]  what it looks like i was actually not that far off contestants pursue the international thief as junior
[236.88 --> 242.72]  detectives who must answer questions about geography yeah okay so that's like that's kind of is that
[242.72 --> 247.36]  kind of what i said i think maybe yeah somewhat yeah it was a children's game show all right there you go
[247.36 --> 254.88]  oh man these reviews these are amazing uh user review pbs is best it was a children's game show
[254.88 --> 261.20]  i used to love to watch when i came home from school along with wishbone yeah you don't know wishbone
[261.20 --> 267.04]  ah forget it whatever i i remember i didn't i didn't watch tv much we we had like the three channel
[267.04 --> 273.92]  rabbit ear thing i just would rather do other stuff yeah i i knew i knew wishbone i only got to watch
[273.92 --> 278.40]  it a couple times but it was like it was a cute uh it was a cute dog that like solved mysteries or
[278.40 --> 284.40]  something it's like right that was that is some 90s that is some classic 90s tv programming if i've
[284.40 --> 292.16]  ever heard of it why don't we jump right into our headline topic for the day which is gpus to become
[292.16 --> 298.96]  more expensive due to trump administration tariffs so these tariffs are not actually new sorry okay no
[298.96 --> 304.80]  what no no no no no luke's gonna say more words this one show luke go ahead hold on this wasn't the
[304.80 --> 311.60]  headline topic yeah it was wasn't it no it was the 74 slower well they're there but i mean the topic
[311.60 --> 318.48]  the headline topic is i hope you hate buying graphics cards because they're both terrible um okay okay so
[318.48 --> 326.48]  due to import tariffs imposed in the us the price of gpus and motherboards will be increased by 7.5 to 25
[326.48 --> 335.12]  oh which is freaking huge ssd's cases and power supplies that output more than 500 watts are also
[335.12 --> 346.88]  affected so anything the msrp of the rtx 3080 is expected to go from 699 to 874 if you're able to actually
[346.88 --> 351.44]  buy one anyways i mean this might make it easier to get one except that didn't bitcoin just hit like
[351.44 --> 359.12]  40 000 us and aren't miners like a big heavy thing right now again yeah so it's probably going to be
[359.12 --> 364.08]  just as hard i i literally suspect it'll just scale the scalp prices will just go up by that much
[364.72 --> 368.96]  and msrp is just going to go up by that much and everyone's still not going to be able to get them
[369.44 --> 374.08]  it's going to be just as bad as it used to be asus has confirmed it needs to raise gpu and
[374.08 --> 381.04]  motherboard prices while basically every other company is doing it more silently so big rip um in
[381.04 --> 386.56]  2018 the trump administration increased import tariffs but due to uh your things blocking the
[386.56 --> 394.40]  thing but due to pushback of oh it's blocking due to pushback specific goods fell under exemptions and
[394.40 --> 401.28]  basically uh over the last little while um the trump administration has just kind of like been busy
[402.16 --> 408.64]  trying to stay the trump administration and have not really like paid attention to certain things so
[410.48 --> 417.68]  yep the the exemptions have expired and as of january 1st prices on your precious pc hardware goods
[417.68 --> 426.00]  are going way up but that's not the whole story yes prices are also probably going up due to things
[426.00 --> 431.68]  like increased shipping costs with covet going on everything everything you could possibly imagine
[431.68 --> 437.36]  is focusing on shipping lately so shipping is getting more and more expensive as uh companies
[437.36 --> 443.28]  are becoming more and more utilized vaccines got to move around that too oh my goodness i didn't even
[443.28 --> 449.52]  think about that um but yeah things need to be shipped everywhere and there's tariffs and those things are
[449.52 --> 453.84]  not mutually exclusive so they're both going to apply at the same time and prices are going to
[453.84 --> 460.32]  go up up up it is possible that the biden administration will reverse those tariffs um but
[460.32 --> 465.12]  there's probably going to be a lot of other stuff they're going to have to do uh immediately after
[465.12 --> 473.60]  taking office so that being a notable priority is unlikely i would suspect can i take a moment to um
[473.60 --> 483.44]  kind of have a little bit of fun amidst this okay okay so um i'm canadian you're canadian too we can both be
[483.44 --> 490.24]  canadian ish yeah we're both we're both fairly canadian um yeah i'm also fairly not but yeah it's complicated
[490.24 --> 499.20]  it's complicated relationship status it's complicated um and usually in canada we have much higher prices
[500.08 --> 507.60]  on computer hardware than you guys do in america interesting but because of a top secret project that
[507.60 --> 514.00]  i'm working on i actually was having a conversation with a hardware manufacturer quite recently about
[514.00 --> 522.72]  what my pricing would be on like gpus or cpus or whatever the case may be nothing to do with mining
[522.72 --> 527.84]  just to clarify it's actually the opposite of that luke you know about the secret project can you confirm
[527.84 --> 533.44]  yes yes i i will fully confirm it is the polar opposite of mining but i did have to have a conversation
[533.44 --> 540.16]  about you know what wholesale prices would be from a manufacturer and it was confirmed to me that
[540.16 --> 547.44]  if i'm in canada and they ship it to canada my price is as much as 25 less and when you combine that
[547.44 --> 553.20]  with the fact that the canadian dollar has been on an absolute tear over the last six months for the
[553.20 --> 563.92]  first time since i think 2000 i want to say like 2008 the 2008 financial crisis computer hardware will
[563.92 --> 572.80]  be cheaper on a like dollars to dollars basis in canada than in the usa that's pretty wild actually
[572.80 --> 582.08]  if you if you shipped a card like how even if how do these tear like if even if you were an individual
[582.08 --> 588.08]  like if an individual in canada bought a card in canada yes and then like shipped it to a friend
[588.08 --> 595.44]  to their friend their friend would be on the hook for the import tariffs and if their canadian friend
[595.44 --> 600.24]  was trying to be a nice guy there eh and uh didn't fill out the paperwork correctly there bud
[600.24 --> 607.92]  um the issue is that that's like uh fraud or whatever so yeah so that's bad so you don't want to do
[607.92 --> 612.40]  that you want to actually fill out all the import documentation correctly so that is something i
[612.40 --> 618.72]  actually did ask i was like hey manufacturer so how does it work if you know i wanted to help out
[618.72 --> 625.04]  some american friends and they're like oh it's on you so i was like yeah it's kind of what i thought
[625.68 --> 630.24]  so that's the way that's the way it works um there's a lot of speculation going on in the chat you
[630.24 --> 635.52]  guys will not figure out what the top secret project is don't even bother trying we are not becoming
[635.52 --> 640.56]  a system integrator that's not happening uh i i want nothing to do with that business i've made
[640.56 --> 647.60]  that very clear many times in the past i was gonna say for years yeah but i just yeah i i'm not i'm not
[647.60 --> 654.00]  gloating or anything i'm just making an interesting observation to be clear i'm not happy about it
[654.00 --> 660.56]  it's not like we're winning you guys are just losing this is a game with no winners yeah your situation
[660.56 --> 666.24]  did not improve you just fell further behind exactly like what i i would love for her you know
[666.24 --> 671.68]  our buying power to just have caught up but that's not what happened uh yours just fell behind now in
[671.68 --> 679.52]  theory the point of these tariffs is to increase u.s jobs but the problem is that when it comes to
[679.52 --> 687.52]  the production of computer components and electronics there's no meaningful way to do that with the
[687.52 --> 693.68]  in the grand scheme of things negligible amount of money that the government will be collecting
[693.68 --> 699.52]  on these tariffs and if you want to see you know how well it works to try to bring high-tech
[699.52 --> 706.80]  manufacturing to the u.s and i don't mean like uh you know uh microprocessor manufacturing that's
[706.80 --> 712.56]  already there i'm talking like you know like motherboards and displays and stuff like that if you
[712.56 --> 717.04]  want to see how successful that's likely to be just have a look at that foxconn project that
[718.40 --> 724.32]  is like basically a ghost factory as far as anyone can tell foxconn factory what is it in like
[724.32 --> 733.44]  wisconsin or something uh man that is like that is a fascinating that is a fascinating rabbit hole
[733.44 --> 740.00]  well there's new stuff this is amazing article from december 18th this is less than a month ago
[740.00 --> 750.08]  foxconn tells wisconsin it never promised to build an lcd factory what there was there was like
[750.08 --> 758.88]  literally a groundbreaking ceremony and stuff and uh that's hilarious yeah it's been like a whole thing
[759.52 --> 766.16]  uh oh this is from december 8th they demolished my house for this residents outraged by the foxconn
[766.16 --> 771.52]  factory that fizzled yeah like the thing is is it's not as simple as just well we need to put the
[771.52 --> 775.60]  building there and we need to put the equipment there and you need to hire us workers and put them
[775.60 --> 783.20]  in there because there's a whole supply chain around building electronics that just doesn't exist in
[783.20 --> 791.52]  north america anymore so it would take years and years and years to build up that kind of
[791.52 --> 798.00]  manufacturing center it would have to be coastal because even in china a lot of the materials for
[798.00 --> 804.40]  that kind of manufacturing are imported and i don't know where the heck you'd put that there
[804.40 --> 810.08]  it'd be an environmental disaster like i don't know how you'd ever get it off the ground and the cost
[810.08 --> 815.36]  would be way higher like it's just it's not feasible there's a reason that people have tried
[815.36 --> 821.20]  to do it and it hasn't worked because the only way electronics are as cheap as they are is that there's
[824.08 --> 829.52]  basically a lot of corners that have been cut in order to make them that way knowing that nothing
[829.52 --> 836.80]  ever happened with it uh makes this groundbreaking picture oh isn't it hilarious amazing
[836.80 --> 843.68]  uh here yeah let me bring it let me bring it up to the stream here but knowing that it probably still
[843.68 --> 850.48]  kind of looks like that if no uh tractors or people were no no they did like build stuff it's okay there
[850.48 --> 854.32]  it's just hiring anybody oh man it is an amazing rabbit hole because they like
[855.20 --> 860.64]  put up a bunch of job postings and then like hired people and then there are like interviews with
[860.64 --> 866.48]  these people who were hired by foxconn to like work in the states and then they're just like yeah
[866.48 --> 871.36]  i don't know i quit because no one could tell me what i'm supposed to do all day like i had an office
[871.36 --> 877.20]  but i had no instructions and no responsibilities like it's like they just had like a head count quota
[877.20 --> 885.44]  to hit and like it's foxconn so they just have like that chinese money so they just apparently don't care like
[885.44 --> 892.40]  like it it's it's just bizarre it is so bizarre anyway here's the here's the ground here's the
[892.40 --> 898.40]  groundbreaking uh oh wow yeah that facility is definitely a thing oh yeah i've never heard of
[898.40 --> 905.20]  this before yeah no it's totally a thing so i forget who exactly all of these people are that kind of
[905.20 --> 909.44]  looks like paul ryan but i don't remember him being there so i i don't know i don't know what the deal
[909.44 --> 913.92]  is with that uh hold on a second here's another picture oh that is that is paul ryan okay so you got paul
[913.92 --> 919.36]  ryan you got the donald and then you've got uh this is a foxconn bigwig of some sort i don't know
[919.36 --> 923.84]  these are all these are all relatively minor details in the grand scheme of things the point is foxconn
[925.60 --> 932.40]  tried um i mean now they're saying they never tried now they're saying oh we never actually
[932.40 --> 937.44]  we never actually committed to making a display factory but that was that that was what they said
[937.44 --> 944.64]  it was going to be um yeah that's that's that's yeah it's it's something uh comments on tom's
[944.64 --> 950.72]  hardware about the situation are pretty bleak uh loaded axe posts looks like diy pc gaming is coming
[950.72 --> 958.96]  to an end prices are already way too high integrated graphics or console anyone uh xbox series x and ps5
[958.96 --> 964.80]  are looking more appealing every day i'm feeling priced out of pc gaming says big dragon and i said it
[964.80 --> 970.80]  once i'll say it again i miss being able to buy a top tier gpu for about 700 us dollars it all went
[970.80 --> 978.64]  to before uh once turing came out actually that that happened a fair bit before that i mean 780ti was
[978.64 --> 980.16]  how much was a 780ti
[983.60 --> 991.52]  oh that was 700 there was stuff before that cost more than that like 6800 ultra uh was
[991.52 --> 1001.52]  oh 500 okay well shows you what i know i could have 8800 8800 ultra was a thousand dollar graphics card
[1002.16 --> 1007.28]  i am almost 100 all of asus's graphics cards manufactured in because they i'm looking it up
[1007.28 --> 1016.32]  right now apparently they have manufacturing in taiwan mexico and czech republic and china is all of their
[1016.32 --> 1021.44]  gpus manufactured in china like this shouldn't affect everything because things that aren't manufactured
[1021.44 --> 1028.64]  in china yeah so the vast majority of like board manufacturing is going to probably be done in
[1028.64 --> 1033.12]  china that doesn't mean that they necessarily make everything there and some of those other places
[1033.12 --> 1040.48]  might be just making components that are ultimately sent to china for assembly or might utilize um
[1041.04 --> 1050.40]  components made in china i don't remember the exact details but basically the us is at trade war with
[1050.40 --> 1055.28]  china that doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon and pc gaming is going to be really expensive
[1055.28 --> 1062.72]  for a minute here okay in other news um the good news is that if you are have if you've been waiting
[1062.72 --> 1070.40]  for uh you know a new laptop for example um graphics cards i expect this pricing to affect them pretty much
[1070.40 --> 1075.84]  immediately because with the demand for new gpus right now pretty much everything's going to be air
[1075.84 --> 1083.84]  shipped so any shipment that arrives in the us after january 1st is going to be affected but there are
[1083.84 --> 1089.84]  other product categories that are more likely to be shipped via ocean that could still have pre-tariff
[1089.84 --> 1095.20]  stocks sitting on shelves so now might be a good time to pick up a gaming notebook especially if these
[1095.20 --> 1103.84]  rumors are true this was uh added to the doc by alex and the rumors and leaks come courtesy of notebook
[1103.84 --> 1113.04]  check tech power up and video cards and the headline is nvidia's rtx 3080 max q could be 74 slower than the
[1113.04 --> 1120.40]  desktop card i mean if you paid attention to the numbers when we were reviewing the rtx 30 series this
[1120.40 --> 1126.16]  might not come as a huge surprise to you but if you weren't looking that closely i'll give you kind of
[1126.16 --> 1135.04]  the cliff's notes compared to the rtx 20 series rtx 30 in spite of the fact that it's built on a smaller
[1135.04 --> 1146.08]  manufacturing process node is not really significantly faster in terms of performance per watt so yes they're
[1146.08 --> 1150.48]  a lot faster i shouldn't say not significantly faster not as much as we've become accustomed to
[1150.48 --> 1160.16]  so yes they are faster but they are also to an almost proportional degree just bigger heavier power
[1160.16 --> 1169.20]  hungrier cards um so it's kind of less like a new generation in that sense and more like just buying
[1169.20 --> 1175.52]  a higher end one and it seems like nvidia i mean bless their hearts as poorly as that turned out for
[1175.52 --> 1181.92]  everybody nvidia took any kinds of efficiency improvements that they got out of uh moving to
[1181.92 --> 1186.48]  a smaller manufacturing process and took it straight to price blew them under the water yeah you know
[1186.48 --> 1192.48]  what's hilarious is that after nvidia's terrible experience being uh and i mean for that matter
[1192.48 --> 1199.04]  probably amd after the terrible experience that they've had being blamed for you know shortages because
[1199.04 --> 1204.64]  the price is so attractive and everybody wants one we are never going to get an aggressively priced gpu
[1204.64 --> 1215.84]  ever again because nvidia yeah nvidia is a company that never forgets okay they never forget and every time
[1215.84 --> 1224.08]  someone comes up with the brilliant idea of of pleasing gamers or you know uh going really aggressive on
[1224.08 --> 1229.60]  price to spoil the launch of the new consoles or whatever the motivation was next time that idea gets
[1229.60 --> 1236.72]  floated around the boardroom table i guarantee you it's going to look kind of like this
[1241.52 --> 1241.84]  kind of
[1246.16 --> 1246.48]  oh
[1248.56 --> 1253.04]  yeah are you showing something yeah the boardroom boardroom suggestion meme you know the one right
[1253.04 --> 1260.56]  okay okay yeah yeah nice okay yeah gotcha i like it yeah hey how about we uh you know sell stuff at a
[1260.56 --> 1269.28]  good price yeah no no you're done you're out you're out that's gone never happening again so okay what does
[1269.28 --> 1277.44]  this mean we could be looking at 3080 max q performance in the neighborhood of a gtx 1080 ti to be
[1277.44 --> 1284.16]  clear gtx 1080 ti performance in a laptop i mean that's not exactly terrible that's yeah better than
[1284.16 --> 1290.40]  a kick in the feet the eyes can run like almost everything and at the resolutions most laptop
[1290.40 --> 1295.60]  screens are gonna be running at you're probably gonna be fine yeah probably gonna have a pretty darn
[1295.60 --> 1302.64]  good gaming experience as long as you don't try to turn on rtx um but you know the fact that the rtx 3080
[1302.64 --> 1309.36]  desktop card had a 320 watt tdp has been a concern for anyone that was hoping for a powerful mobile
[1309.36 --> 1318.48]  variant so what it feels like is while there may be a 3080 like non max q so that would be the max p
[1319.12 --> 1325.84]  even that one is going to be 150 watt so that whole paradigm shift that took place with maxwell which was
[1325.84 --> 1334.48]  the 900 series cards from nvidia where they went from having like the desktop lineup which was up here
[1334.48 --> 1341.84]  and then the mobile lineup which was like just completely different gpus uh with 900 series they
[1341.84 --> 1348.24]  brought them almost to performance parity it was like it was mind-blowing for us at the time because
[1348.24 --> 1355.20]  in the past you know you're i'm just trying to think of like yeah let's go back to like you know 7 000
[1355.20 --> 1363.12]  series like like the old old 7 000 series you know like a 7800 gt in desktop was a completely different
[1363.12 --> 1371.52]  gpu from a 7800 gt on mobile like the one on mobile would have been like a 7600 and it was just branded
[1371.52 --> 1378.80]  7800 so getting this uh sort of branding parity for the gpu even if they were running at slightly different
[1378.80 --> 1383.84]  clock speeds or at different power envelopes which is what we've seen a lot of lately with max p that's
[1383.84 --> 1392.64]  max performance and max q which is maximum quietness um max q with like sort of different different
[1392.64 --> 1398.48]  thermal and power envelopes at least it's still the same gpu and that still does appear to be the case
[1398.48 --> 1405.84]  so these are still similar classes in terms of how many CUDA cores they have no they're not oh i lied
[1405.84 --> 1410.24]  okay that's no specifically the difference no we're going we're going we're going back to the old way
[1410.24 --> 1417.12]  oh that's a bummer okay what what do we have then luke it's just lower everything lower performance
[1417.12 --> 1423.04]  lower CUDA cores it's it's a totally intensely different experience to the point where naming
[1423.04 --> 1429.92]  them a similar thing is is kind of egregious um i there's a note in here somewhere i don't remember
[1429.92 --> 1437.84]  exactly where it was where they hope that they are very clear to consumers about the tgp of the mobile
[1437.84 --> 1443.68]  graphics cards and i hope that as well because that's not gonna happen um it's it's not but uh
[1444.48 --> 1450.88]  not that far in the past we had like pretty close to performance parity between the mobile and the
[1450.88 --> 1459.28]  desktop cards um and now we are we have completely thrown that in the garbage uh and that's that's not
[1459.28 --> 1467.76]  a good thing for consumers i don't actually necessarily think it's that big of a deal in terms of like
[1467.76 --> 1472.64]  what you're going to be able to do i think the vast majority of mobile gaming experiences will be
[1472.64 --> 1479.92]  just fine if you're able to get like 1080 ti level of performance but what you're expecting and like
[1479.92 --> 1485.76]  what you're reading online versus what you're going to get is probably going to be a confusing experience
[1485.76 --> 1490.48]  for a very large amount of consumers that aren't extremely dialed in yeah so let's go through some of
[1490.48 --> 1497.76]  these speeds and feeds because they do kind of matter if tech power up is correct the rtx 3080 max q so
[1497.76 --> 1504.32]  that's the more power efficient model will have an 80 watt tdp so that's total uh what is it thermal
[1504.32 --> 1508.88]  design power or total design power or whatever it is so basically it's allowed to consume 80 watts
[1509.52 --> 1519.04]  and it'll be clocked at 780 megahertz base 1245 boost for reference that boost is less than the base clock of a
[1519.04 --> 1528.16]  desktop 3080 so desktop 3080 is 1440 base 1710 boost that's yeah it's not off by like 50 or something
[1528.16 --> 1535.60]  like it's the the boost is off by a considerable amount than the base and it uses the same ga104 gpu so
[1535.60 --> 1544.88]  it is still the same silicon ish but the max q is going to have only 61 044 CUDA cores enabled compared to the
[1544.88 --> 1553.44]  desktops 8704 so it's more than just 100 yeah it's more than just a clock speed difference so both of
[1553.44 --> 1561.68]  those things if you drop your CUDA cores by 20 you are basically looking at a 20-ish percent performance
[1561.68 --> 1567.52]  drop if you drop your clock speed by 20 you are basically looking at like a 20 performance difference
[1567.52 --> 1572.88]  if you do both of those things they kind of stack like it's it's not quite it's not just
[1572.88 --> 1578.88]  the 40 because of 20 from both it's like it's worse no no it's it's less worse it should be less worse
[1578.88 --> 1586.32]  than that but it's it's still it's terrible um there's some good news though so the 3080 max p will
[1586.32 --> 1594.40]  be 150 watts and boost up to 1545 for those who do need more performance but because that's a 150 watt gpu
[1594.40 --> 1601.68]  you can expect that to only be present in either very thick or very cleverly designed laptops now
[1601.68 --> 1608.08]  when luke says that this is a bad thing for consumers he doesn't mean like you know oh it's tragic we're
[1608.08 --> 1618.72]  gonna have fewer fps for our games yeah well no one think of the gamers it's not like that it's just
[1618.72 --> 1626.24]  that it's bad for consumers when marketing versus reality doesn't have a strong correlation and
[1626.24 --> 1631.36]  especially when and i i would i would bring this up too is like i mentioned the like not that long ago
[1631.36 --> 1638.80]  we found this performance parity between mobile and desktop cards that was uh i would say at least
[1638.80 --> 1644.80]  rather heavily marketed yes it was absolutely that we have that we have the future is that we have
[1644.80 --> 1649.92]  accomplished this goal of mobile cards and desktop cards coming together and essentially being the
[1649.92 --> 1656.72]  same thing that was like it is going to be this way now um was how that communication felt yeah and
[1656.72 --> 1664.80]  for it to be not that long since then and now we're in a situation where it's like very very notable and
[1664.80 --> 1669.76]  rather intense performance differences is kind of a shame i mean you say not that long but it's long
[1669.76 --> 1678.64]  enough that i kind of got used to this being how it was going to be forever ish so yeah even even
[1678.64 --> 1685.12]  jens yeah it would be very easy to accidentally buy the wrong thing like you could buy yeah with that
[1685.12 --> 1694.48]  okay so there are 10 plus different models at the various different uh frame buffer amounts and uh like
[1694.48 --> 1702.16]  thermal and power limits 10 plus different models that will be called rtx 3080 mobile with very different
[1702.16 --> 1709.36]  performance characteristics so you could easily be trying to compare you know this thin and light
[1709.36 --> 1715.84]  laptop with an rtx 3080 and this super heavy chonky thing with an rtx 3080 and they're the same price
[1715.84 --> 1722.08]  and think oh well they're well they both have an rtx 3080 i'll just get the one that's like thinner and sexier
[1722.08 --> 1727.68]  but the difference in performance could be enormous and it could even get to the point in fact probably
[1727.68 --> 1734.96]  will where you could have like a chunkier laptop design with an rtx 3070 max p so that's a max
[1734.96 --> 1743.12]  performance that would be more performant than a thin laptop with an rtx 3080 max q even though the
[1743.12 --> 1748.32]  thick one is cheaper it could actually be faster with a lower model number so
[1748.32 --> 1758.88]  i mean it almost it's almost gotten to the point where like it feels like kind of uh kind of how
[1759.60 --> 1765.52]  you know 80 plus stepped in and was like okay there needs to be like a third party that certifies power
[1765.52 --> 1771.04]  supplies for their efficiency to be clear 80 plus is not a perfect system oh geez yeah how the heck would
[1771.04 --> 1775.76]  you apply that here at all but i see where you're going though i think there will i think there could be
[1775.76 --> 1782.80]  a way to apply it i think that if if nvidia and amd got in touch with steve from gamers nexus and
[1782.80 --> 1791.12]  were like okay design us no i'm serious nexus rating design us yeah design us a nexus a nexus
[1791.12 --> 1798.16]  rating system for how fast the graphics card is for this thing i think something like that could
[1798.16 --> 1804.32]  actually have a value at this point i know i know 3d mark exists i'm aware of it but it's
[1804.32 --> 1812.08]  it's it's it's terrible it's not it doesn't tell us anything really useful just because of the way
[1812.08 --> 1818.72]  the scores are derived and the fact that they don't really uh correlate to real world performance in
[1818.72 --> 1824.48]  actual games and i have no idea how you know this certification system could ever get off the ground
[1824.48 --> 1830.56]  because game developers would have to license their games for use in testing and you might think oh well
[1830.56 --> 1834.56]  game developers would love this because it's just extra exposure for their game why would they ever
[1834.56 --> 1842.08]  say no but i had the most bizarre experience not ever because i've seen a lot of bizarre stuff being in
[1842.08 --> 1848.00]  this industry for this long but i had a very bizarre experience in an intel showroom at one point where
[1848.00 --> 1854.80]  they were showing off some next generation onboard graphics or something and on the little card next to
[1854.80 --> 1862.40]  the prototype it was like uh can run fortnite at playable uh frame rates at these settings and then
[1862.40 --> 1867.84]  the game that they were running on it was like counter-strike and i was like hey so you guys know
[1867.84 --> 1873.20]  that fortnite is like the biggest thing in the world right now why is fortnite not running on the
[1873.20 --> 1880.40]  laptop and they're like because we couldn't get them to agree to let us run it for the demo that would
[1880.40 --> 1890.00]  actually be kind of cool like a sticker from a third-party agency that gave you five to ten even
[1890.00 --> 1899.28]  uh current like i'd say important to the average consumer games and their certified performance levels
[1899.28 --> 1905.04]  yep that would be pretty cool this is i mean there are system integrators that try to do this to an extent
[1905.04 --> 1910.48]  so they'll and there are some that even try to spit out how many fps that you'll get um so it's not
[1910.48 --> 1917.36]  like this doesn't exist on an si level but it's not being done well at all on mobile and i would like to
[1917.36 --> 1926.56]  see like your your 30 60 and plus things for each game like these are the settings that you can run to get
[1926.56 --> 1931.68]  this frame rate certified on this laptop that would be cool i think that would be genuinely very helpful
[1931.68 --> 1937.52]  for consumers not like one score for the laptop as a whole but like a bunch of different games
[1937.52 --> 1943.04]  because drivers and stuff are going to be issues there yeah that's fair that's actually yeah that's
[1943.04 --> 1950.88]  not a bad idea so this is like an a for uh fortnite and it's like a b for call of duty and it's a c for
[1950.88 --> 1956.32]  cyberpunk because nothing can run yeah because you could have a a gamer that's only really interested in
[1956.32 --> 1963.52]  like fortnite league of legends and counter-strike um and if it if it scores really highly in those
[1963.52 --> 1969.44]  games then great they don't really necessarily care about the rest the only way to really do that
[1969.44 --> 1977.04]  is to keep industry from like influencing it though like because think about it think about how much
[1977.04 --> 1981.76]  pressure there's gonna be so if i'm best buy right let's look at all the players right so there's the
[1981.76 --> 1989.36]  manufacturers there's the game developers there's the retailers the resellers okay so these are these
[1989.36 --> 1993.28]  are a few of the players that are going to be trying to exert influence on a program like this
[1993.28 --> 2000.72]  if i'm the manufacturer i want only the games that are going to reflect favorably on my machine to be
[2000.72 --> 2007.36]  shown on the the little tag right okay yeah if i'm a game developer i don't want my game used to
[2007.36 --> 2011.76]  validate any machine that it's a bad experience on i'd just rather you don't mention me at all
[2012.32 --> 2017.76]  if i'm a retailer i don't want to put anything i mean you know the you know good better best right
[2018.40 --> 2024.88]  you know in terms of product segmentation nobody ever wants to call anything bad so everything has
[2024.88 --> 2031.76]  to be good better best and then if i'm a truly independent certification body that wants to provide
[2031.76 --> 2037.28]  meaningful information to consumers i have to be able to say no look i need to be able to
[2037.28 --> 2043.84]  put an f on something i have to be able to fail something or give it a c and and you know what
[2044.80 --> 2050.48]  sorry cd project red i'm sorry but you know the vast majority like there's literally no machine on
[2050.48 --> 2056.40]  the shelf of a best buy that is going to provide an a experience in this game so that's just the
[2056.40 --> 2061.68]  reality of it i'm sorry i can't move the bar for you but every one of those and so every one of those
[2061.68 --> 2067.76]  players is able to exert pressure because manufacturers can just say okay well then we
[2067.76 --> 2073.12]  just won't submit our machine for certification game developers can say okay then we just won't
[2073.12 --> 2077.60]  license you to use our game for your testing and retailers will say okay well then we're just not
[2077.60 --> 2081.20]  going to put your certification on the shelf because it makes the products look bad and hurt sales
[2081.84 --> 2086.80]  so if you don't if you don't give in to our pressure and just give everything an a then we just
[2086.80 --> 2093.60]  won't use it and there's no way to win i think the only potential way that i wouldn't even get around
[2093.60 --> 2098.56]  all those concerns at all but it would hopefully maybe alleviate them a little bit maybe enough i'm
[2098.56 --> 2107.28]  not sure is to only show the things on there that get that good sort of good better best certification
[2107.28 --> 2113.28]  everybody's going to try to get you to not show anything bad until there's nothing left to show and
[2113.28 --> 2119.60]  there is no certification program well no because there would be some things that the computer is
[2119.60 --> 2125.92]  going to be good at um or it's not a gaming pc like kind of one of the two yeah but it just it ends
[2125.92 --> 2130.88]  up not meaningful because if all you can say is good things like i don't know i get a lot of people
[2130.88 --> 2136.88]  complaining to me that i'm too critical like why are you so critical it's like but because it's my job
[2136.88 --> 2141.04]  if all i said was good things i would just be the product manufacturer why don't you just go on their
[2141.04 --> 2145.12]  website why do you bother watching my video if all you want to hear is good things and you kind of
[2145.12 --> 2150.16]  need both sides you need super critical and you need kind of more positive angles i guess i embrace
[2150.16 --> 2159.12]  my role yeah so yeah if you even if you started out with the best of intentions i just i just don't
[2159.12 --> 2164.64]  think that a program like that could work now i mean talking about it makes me like want to do it
[2164.64 --> 2169.04]  like oh yeah this wouldn't be that hard you just get laptops in you could kind of automate all the
[2169.04 --> 2173.76]  testing to a significant degree it spits out a report that basically goes yeah here was the
[2173.76 --> 2179.52]  acoustics and thermals the whole time so you can basically just like you drop it in uh an acoustic
[2179.52 --> 2185.44]  chamber uh you could totally do it you could totally do it you could totally do it it would be freaking
[2185.44 --> 2192.96]  awesome and then it just probably wouldn't even need um line of sectors probably wouldn't even need
[2193.52 --> 2199.36]  like support from anybody you could just do it we could just do it it would be it would be a significant
[2199.36 --> 2206.32]  upfront investment in proper testing equipment because you can't tell the story of fps until you
[2206.32 --> 2211.52]  tell the story of thermals and acoustics especially with a completed device like a laptop because remember
[2211.52 --> 2218.24]  that's the concern with desktops from my perspective it's basically on you if you buy a case that doesn't
[2218.24 --> 2223.60]  have any ventilation and your graphics card doesn't perform properly like if you're building a system
[2223.60 --> 2229.84]  then you kind of have to do a little bit of research but when you buy a completed goods product
[2229.84 --> 2238.16]  like a laptop that's been in my opinion misleadingly marketed in this case i think you have a right to
[2238.16 --> 2245.76]  have a number that's actually meaningful shown to you and there's all kinds of other problems because
[2245.76 --> 2251.60]  you know for example uh some manufacturers have multiple modes that the laptop can operate in so
[2251.60 --> 2258.96]  testing ones like that could become a very very cumbersome process where you have to like put it
[2258.96 --> 2267.12]  in cpu oc mode and then fan turbo mode and then non-cpu oc mode non-fan turbo mode and then gpu oc mode and then
[2268.00 --> 2273.04]  that like so you're testing the same system you know eight ten different times with all the different
[2273.04 --> 2277.68]  you really want to automate it for sure yeah but there's a lot of those things that wouldn't be
[2277.68 --> 2282.16]  possible to automate like you'd have to come back and press the button to put it in you know silence
[2282.16 --> 2290.56]  optimized mode and then sure yeah run it again yeah um we should probably jump into one of our actually we
[2290.56 --> 2295.28]  should probably talk sponsors today because we have to end the stream at a reasonable time uh because we
[2295.28 --> 2300.72]  have another stream coming shortly after this one it's going to be over on twitch and flow plane we are
[2300.72 --> 2307.84]  doing a memorial stream for tyler uh one of the members of our team who um tragically passed away
[2307.84 --> 2314.08]  during the holiday this year it's going to be to support tyler's family with some of the funeral costs
[2314.08 --> 2321.04]  um and then i think if they if they beat that target there there's also um a charity that he cared
[2321.04 --> 2326.48]  about that they're going to be contributing to so stay tuned guys because we've got that coming after the
[2326.48 --> 2334.16]  wans show today i think the plan is 7 p.m pacific yeah ivan's giving me the nod um we're going to be
[2334.16 --> 2340.72]  playing uh a game that he that he loved in tabletop simulator uh it should be should be really good
[2341.60 --> 2350.40]  from like a like not like a i mean yeah it'll be nice to sit and remember him for a bit i don't know
[2350.40 --> 2357.44]  if i would describe it as like good um in the same way that like people being still with us would be
[2357.44 --> 2363.20]  good you know yeah uh so right we got to get through we got to get through our sponsors for
[2363.20 --> 2369.84]  the show today yes the show is brought to you today by kite kite is a plugin that adds ai powered

[2466.56 --> 2471.76]  show is brought to you by vessie vessie footwear is known for making comfortable shoes that are light
[2471.76 --> 2478.72]  and most importantly water resistant with vessie shoes you can walk in almost can you go out to deal with
[2478.72 --> 2485.44]  her oh okay uh you can walk in almost any terrain while keeping your feet dry as long as you don't walk
[2485.44 --> 2490.96]  like all the way in the water so that it comes up over the top only the material is water resistant
[2490.96 --> 2496.00]  and they've got multiple different styles and colors to choose from every oh wow okay you can
[2496.00 --> 2503.44]  get 25 off each pair with offer code wansho and check them out at vessie.com slash wansho and you have
[2503.44 --> 2509.52]  to say it exactly like that my girlfriend just bought a pair and i don't think she knew about the 25 off
[2509.52 --> 2516.00]  prepare code are you serious get wrecked yeah they like just showed up yesterday or something were
[2516.00 --> 2524.40]  you like yo plenty time like you know that like they sponsor like i i did tell her uh she was she
[2524.40 --> 2529.52]  was talking about getting like water resistant shoes and i did tell her that they they sponsored us
[2529.52 --> 2537.36]  oh she said i did know and i used the linus code so nice there we go nice way to go plenty time is she
[2537.36 --> 2544.48]  still streaming uh yeah okay nice nice nice that's that's where the plenty time uh nickname comes
[2544.48 --> 2552.32]  from that's her streamer tag yes uh we do also have one more kind of plug but it's for ltdstore.com
[2552.32 --> 2563.60]  guess what guess what it's actually pretty cool so john and sarah collaborated on a new product let me
[2563.60 --> 2569.76]  just see if i can actually find a reference to it on the thing oh okay if i could take a turn in being

[2703.76 --> 2709.60]  birthday yeah i didn't think of that originally i had one but it was like way too fake it was like
[2709.60 --> 2718.24]  saying that i was like 80 or something so that i just um in 2017 on november 12th a representative from
[2718.24 --> 2724.80]  electronic arts infamously leaves the most downvoted that was on my birthday the most downvoted comment
[2724.80 --> 2730.72]  in the history of reddit regarding how long it took to unlock certain characters in the game star wars
[2730.72 --> 2736.08]  battlefront 2. i remember that very vividly that's actually pretty cool all right what's my birthday
[2737.20 --> 2742.24]  hit me with my birthday i will neither confirm nor deny if this is my fake or real birthday but i would
[2742.24 --> 2748.80]  like to hear the uh i'd like to hear my my tech quickie horoscope from august 20th okay people are
[2748.80 --> 2755.92]  like no spoilers hold on and then someone's like 20 for that are you kidding do you have any idea how
[2755.92 --> 2761.20]  long it took john and sarah to do this and it's it's like mostly a bundle item so most people are going
[2761.20 --> 2766.96]  to get it for free yeah so free for that yeah that sounds awesome cry more oh wow do you did you know
[2766.96 --> 2778.16]  what this one was no i i don't okay august 20th uh 1986 uh uh linus sebastian of linus oh you gotta
[2778.16 --> 2785.92]  be kidding me he put that in there okay i actually did not know that was gonna happen that's hilarious
[2789.12 --> 2796.80]  uh okay that's really funny i don't know how to i don't know how to tell john this because if
[2796.80 --> 2803.44]  i i'm like hey that's pretty funny he'll know that i didn't proof it um but if i don't say anything
[2803.44 --> 2809.76]  then he might feel bad because then he'll know i didn't ever prove it oh my goodness that's even
[2809.76 --> 2816.08]  more funny i don't know so far jumping through to just two random dates this has been great i'm i'm
[2816.08 --> 2822.48]  excited yeah this is cool cool uh well good work thank you float plane team for making it happen
[2822.48 --> 2831.52]  let's jump into our next topic here it was a matter of time whatsapp to start compulsory information
[2831.52 --> 2837.92]  sharing with facebook by the way hon we probably need to switch off whatsapp uh signal telegram
[2837.92 --> 2842.72]  something like that signal i've i've been using signal for quite a while now and i love it it's
[2842.72 --> 2848.00]  great i haven't like i haven't compared them recently because it hasn't really been a concern for me i've
[2848.00 --> 2851.92]  been like yeah whatever facebook owns whatsapp who cares i'll just use it anyway because it's very
[2851.92 --> 2857.36]  convenient works really well um but i guess i don't know i might have to it didn't signal just
[2857.36 --> 2862.64]  recently launched video calling like didn't they like just finally get across the line of like feature
[2863.36 --> 2869.12]  parody enough that we could switch without caring i'm not sure because i've like never video called
[2869.12 --> 2874.40]  through either of those services it's not a thing i care about but um that would be pretty funny if that
[2874.40 --> 2879.12]  was the case can we have a side conversation here for a second here what is up with video calling
[2879.12 --> 2887.28]  just just kind of all sucks um who i see people doing this i see people doing it they carry their
[2887.28 --> 2891.60]  phone around with them they got their phone out in front of their face and they're like walking down
[2891.60 --> 2902.40]  the street having a video call why yeah i don't know i i genuinely have no idea i that's a that's a category of
[2902.40 --> 2908.00]  person that i have definitely never been a part of and i i feel like i've known very few people that
[2908.00 --> 2915.36]  were a part of it okay because i just like for me it's like i i i i don't i don't know i don't know
[2915.36 --> 2920.08]  how to talk about my objections to it without maybe sounding like a bit of a jerk or something
[2920.08 --> 2926.48]  so maybe i'll just i'll just roll i just don't get it personally like it feels like it's so much more
[2926.48 --> 2934.56]  effort for especially when you're like walking around randomly it's like mildly obnoxious it sounds
[2934.56 --> 2942.16]  like a lot more effort and for like what actual gain i don't i don't know so that person not seen you
[2942.16 --> 2949.36]  i i don't know i i mean okay i can see flipping it on momentarily like for example the badminton
[2949.36 --> 2957.04]  center that i uh set up with that video gear um they were they were having trouble with like some
[2957.04 --> 2960.80]  cable or something and i was like oh why don't you just like flip on video and it's like oh yeah yeah
[2960.80 --> 2965.12]  let's do that and they pointed at the thing and i was able to walk through yeah so like it hasn't it
[2965.12 --> 2972.00]  absolutely has a problem i have i have used video calling before uh to get extremely not tech savvy
[2972.00 --> 2978.72]  people to uh show me their screen so that i can verbally use their mouse for them to install team
[2978.72 --> 2983.44]  viewers so that i can actually control their computer it's been very helpful for that 100
[2984.16 --> 2989.44]  uh jason roach says linus i video call at the supermarket the missus is vegan and i need to know
[2989.44 --> 2997.12]  what to buy 100 so when you need to convey something that is much easier with video that's fine but why do
[2997.12 --> 3001.76]  you need to stare at each other's face while you're talking i don't understand it for like
[3002.24 --> 3007.52]  for for like a more formal meeting i don't mind it but if i'm just talking to friends
[3008.16 --> 3013.76]  my phone's in my pocket and i've got my headphones in so that i can like do other things because quite
[3013.76 --> 3022.40]  frankly i i'm not going to focus a hundred percent of my attention on you i i don't know i mean my wife
[3022.40 --> 3026.80]  does it from time to time vaughn why why do you video call just anyone
[3026.80 --> 3033.76]  i don't yeah you do sometimes you video call like oh what's my sister who's far away yeah and i don't
[3033.76 --> 3040.08]  see them and i don't see the kids yeah you want to see them why see how much they've grown okay okay
[3040.08 --> 3046.56]  so okay okay a relative with kids you want to see like how they're growing up all right yeah and you're
[3046.56 --> 3054.80]  like really far apart yeah it's nice to why makes you feel closer okay well there you go there it is
[3056.32 --> 3059.68]  she's tried to video call me while i've been traveling for work before and i'm just like do we
[3059.68 --> 3068.00]  have to do we need to well no but the kids want to and i'm like see their generation is just going
[3068.00 --> 3073.84]  to be like well you know why wouldn't you just turn the feature on dad it's right there it doesn't
[3073.84 --> 3080.24]  take any more effort exactly yeah it's literally on by default what's wrong with you you know what
[3080.24 --> 3086.32]  this is really interesting i was talking to my dentist um i was there yesterday getting the wire put on my
[3086.32 --> 3094.40]  braces and he's he he's very chatty my my dentist is hilarious um so he's just going on about
[3094.40 --> 3099.44]  whatever random garbage and he's like yeah did you hear about how there's a big uptick in cosmetic
[3099.44 --> 3105.68]  surgery lately and i'm like no i didn't and honestly that's totally counterintuitive to me because i
[3105.68 --> 3113.84]  would think with all the uh limitations around dating and going out in public and like hosting parties
[3113.84 --> 3117.84]  and just all those like social gatherings with all those limitations i would actually think
[3117.84 --> 3125.44]  people would be less inclined to do something like that not not um and that's ignoring like the sort
[3125.44 --> 3131.44]  of the increase in risk and exposure of being in like a medical facility you know during during these
[3131.44 --> 3138.80]  times but then he's like no no no no it's all about zoom meetings and i was like what why he's like
[3138.80 --> 3143.76]  yeah apparently it's just like psychologically it has to do with looking at your own face far more
[3143.76 --> 3150.96]  frequently seeing all those imperfections and wanting to fix them so you're checking your own
[3150.96 --> 3157.20]  camera feed and identifying and being way more self-conscious of yourself just like multiple
[3157.20 --> 3163.84]  times throughout the day and another another angle on that that i also kind of thought of is if you are
[3163.84 --> 3170.16]  someone who is you know not working like let's say you work in a field where you're where you are like
[3170.16 --> 3175.52]  me okay uh where video or pictures of you are taken every day let's say you're off work because you're
[3175.52 --> 3180.00]  like an actor or something and your productions are shut down hey that's a perfect time to get a tune-up
[3180.96 --> 3186.88]  so it could be one of either things either because you're not seeing people you could go and you know
[3186.88 --> 3191.36]  get some tweaks done or because you're seeing people every day you feel more self-conscious and you
[3191.36 --> 3195.84]  go get get some tweaks done and he was like yeah yeah apparently it's been like a big thing like they're
[3195.84 --> 3204.40]  they're overrun they're inundated i'm like wow oh people you so you're so funny you so funny i don't
[3204.40 --> 3211.28]  think i will ever consider anything in that realm ever under any circumstance other than like being
[3211.28 --> 3218.24]  maimed you know what's funny i would have said that at one point in time or another and i had a
[3218.24 --> 3222.64]  conversation with i'm not going to name them just because i don't know if they're like chill with their
[3222.64 --> 3227.44]  views on this being out in the public but i had a conversation on a work trip you know how like the
[3227.44 --> 3232.48]  deep conversations tend to happen on like those overnight crazy trips where nobody sleeps anyway
[3233.20 --> 3241.12]  yep and i was kind of i was brought around to the point where i would at least think about it um
[3241.12 --> 3247.76]  because before i was like hard no and then i was like i would at least consider this and the argument was
[3248.48 --> 3254.00]  you know what what is the difference between what you've already done i've had dental work done for
[3254.00 --> 3260.32]  example it's not like i couldn't eat before like it's it was purely cosmetic and they're like what's
[3260.32 --> 3267.44]  the difference if there's a relatively uninvasive thing that you can do to make yourself look and feel
[3267.44 --> 3274.32]  better who cares and i was like i just feel like like okay i'm just gonna embrace my oldness because i i
[3274.32 --> 3279.20]  i i personally it's it's not none of it for me is like there's there's no like moral battle here like
[3279.20 --> 3285.44]  i don't think it's a bad thing to do i don't look down on people that do it i don't care at all um but
[3285.44 --> 3292.80]  it's just i for me personally i find it less attractive and i don't mean like oh i find you hot i mean like
[3293.36 --> 3300.08]  just in general i find it less attractive when people try to hide like they're aging or whatever else
[3300.08 --> 3306.32]  like if someone's like balding and they like grow out a foot of hair on the back of their head and
[3306.32 --> 3311.04]  then just like wrap it around the rest of their head like that's i don't i'm not into that personally
[3311.04 --> 3317.04]  but if like okay like my dad started balding he's like okay just shaved it all off like i i think that's
[3317.04 --> 3322.08]  cooler in my opinion so that's your that's your angle that's your yeah i don't know that's my thing
[3322.08 --> 3326.48]  but then again i don't push that on anyone else so i just i probably wouldn't do it because
[3326.48 --> 3333.28]  i'm just yeah i'm just not into it so the line for this colleague that i again i don't want to name
[3333.28 --> 3341.12]  the line for this colleague was maintenance is chill but like for them anyway this was their
[3341.12 --> 3345.28]  personal opinion that i'm just kind of sharing with you guys their personal opinion was maintenance is
[3345.28 --> 3352.64]  chill but making like noticeable changes like becoming a different person yeah like becoming
[3352.64 --> 3356.24]  looking like a different person they were like yeah i'm i'm not that cool with that
[3356.24 --> 3360.48]  of course you know one of the reasons that everyone has such a different take on this is
[3360.48 --> 3366.08]  that everyone was born in a different body and has so personal yeah it's so personal 100 personal
[3367.36 --> 3372.32]  so it's it's you know it's all fine and good for you know someone who was happened to be born with
[3372.32 --> 3378.64]  the gift of amazing looks to say yeah i look down on cosmetic surgery anyone who does it is disgusting
[3378.64 --> 3383.92]  by the way you know how do you like my you know perfectly shaped breasts and pouty lips and
[3383.92 --> 3390.00]  you know smoky eyes that i don't even you know i happen to be born with black you know lines along
[3390.00 --> 3394.80]  my eyes i don't even need eyeliner i look down on makeup you know like it's very easy depending on
[3394.80 --> 3402.24]  how someone was was born for them to um for them to have a yeah definitely if it's gonna like make
[3402.24 --> 3407.20]  in my opinion if it's gonna make a notable improvement in your life to like do whatever just do it like i don't
[3407.20 --> 3413.92]  i don't care at all just for me personally i feel like i would be happier and more confident in myself
[3413.92 --> 3423.44]  if i just embraced whatever was going on again you know you happen to be tall blue-eyed blonde um
[3424.00 --> 3430.24]  you know beard doesn't go in properly is there is there cosmetic surgery for like oh 100 have you seen
[3430.24 --> 3437.60]  before and afters of elon's head like that's true actually because i posted i posted just like a
[3437.60 --> 3443.68]  tongue-in-cheek um i posted a picture of jeff bezos on twitter like like a month ago or something like
[3443.68 --> 3451.60]  that and i was like the caption was scientific proof that every hair loss prevention um uh like cure is a
[3451.60 --> 3457.28]  scam because the richest man in the world not anymore the richest man in the world is you know spearballed
[3457.28 --> 3462.48]  right and then i think if you dropped all the all the money that his ex-wife currently holds like if
[3462.48 --> 3467.60]  they didn't break up i think he'd probably still be the richest man and then a ton of the comments
[3467.60 --> 3475.04]  were like um actually with before and afters of elon musk elon musk and i was like hmm i see actually
[3475.04 --> 3481.36]  they look the cures look pretty good it looks like as long as you've got a cool 100 billion or whatever
[3481.36 --> 3486.88]  he's worth these days you can you can take care of that someone knows how yeah real quick styles
[3486.88 --> 3492.88]  elon knows the way it's like he's solving the big problems the world has like how to get to mars and
[3492.88 --> 3496.88]  how to make sure that you can have a full head of hair as long as you got the money for it
[3497.60 --> 3503.60]  yeah um so there's a ton of comments about this topic you guys are like super engaged on the topic
[3503.60 --> 3509.28]  i think i think quite a few people like feel very personally about it i that's interesting and like
[3509.28 --> 3514.16]  and like i think a lot of people also judge other people's actions here quite a bit yeah totally
[3514.16 --> 3518.72]  so we've got people saying i've had to get it it's hard to figure out where to stop there's always
[3518.72 --> 3524.00]  more to get that's really interesting because for me as someone who's like only thought about it and
[3524.00 --> 3532.24]  kind of like a theoretical way um it's like yeah i could totally see how just like like anything like
[3532.24 --> 3538.16]  uh getting into rc cars for example you get a starter car you go out and like you rip it around one
[3538.16 --> 3544.40]  time right and you're like oh man i wish i i wish i had four wheel drive or oh man i wish i got the
[3544.40 --> 3552.08]  brushless motor or like why didn't i spring for the lipo battery lithium polymer lithium polymer is what
[3552.08 --> 3557.68]  i was talking about lithium polymer battery it's type of battery for rc cars okay the point is the first
[3557.68 --> 3566.16]  time you like go for a ride on the subway and you like get 10 more looks or whatever i can see how
[3566.16 --> 3573.04]  something like that the kind of endorphin hit you might get might make you like inclined to go back
[3573.04 --> 3578.40]  and get one more thing or one more thing or whatever else uh javier says what about botox for
[3578.40 --> 3583.84]  wrinkles i don't know for me personally i've always looked like this when i smile i went back and looked
[3583.84 --> 3589.44]  at a picture of myself when i was like 16 and like i've always been like this so i really don't think
[3589.44 --> 3594.24]  there's any solution for it for me yeah you mentioned it like a couple of years ago and i was like
[3594.24 --> 3598.96]  what i guess you're like i'm old i have crow's feet now and i was like what are you talking about
[3599.68 --> 3604.48]  it was okay they are a little heavier like so even when i'm not really smiling that much
[3604.48 --> 3610.64]  they're there now and they kind of like okay they're pretty good um i'm i'm doing okay but uh
[3610.64 --> 3615.84]  what would you do what would i do a really personal question you don't have to answer but like
[3616.48 --> 3621.20]  you said you've kind of vaguely thought about it so like what are what have you vaguely thought so
[3621.20 --> 3626.32]  for me the biggest things like i'm pretty i'm pretty comfortable in my own skin the only things
[3626.32 --> 3630.56]  that i really do i'll get you know what fine you know what screw it let's get real personal here
[3630.56 --> 3638.24]  um the only things i really do maintenance wise is like hair hair maintenance including uh eyebrows
[3638.24 --> 3644.24]  and that's after years of pressure from my wife and also it's gotten worse if i let it go it really
[3644.24 --> 3649.28]  does start to connect these days and i'm like oh yeah it's really it's not that much effort and once you
[3649.28 --> 3654.40]  pull them a few times a they start to come in less thick because you kind of kill the follicles by
[3654.40 --> 3657.92]  pulling them out repeatedly and b they don't hurt as much because they have like a looser grip so it's
[3657.92 --> 3663.68]  really not that bad anymore um i went back and i got my teeth straightened that was both a cosmetic
[3663.68 --> 3673.28]  concern and a um a practical concern though so if you look uh yeah i don't know they're quite like down
[3673.28 --> 3678.08]  they're right here and then they're kind of crowded here so what happens when you get crowding like
[3678.08 --> 3684.16]  that is they're harder to clean which makes it more likely for you to get cavities which makes it more
[3684.16 --> 3693.44]  likely for you to um well lose your front teeth and for me as someone who is a public figure um i don't
[3693.44 --> 3702.72]  consider um losing my front teeth to be really an option option it's it's sort of part of it's part of appearing
[3703.84 --> 3710.48]  nice on on camera um and i remember i remember my mom explaining this to me when they spent money we
[3710.48 --> 3715.76]  didn't have to have my teeth corrected in the first place because i used to have a fairly significant overbite
[3715.76 --> 3721.92]  um and i had the crowding before it was and it was fixed before but then it's over time it's kind of gone back
[3721.92 --> 3729.84]  together and my mom basically said um i'm making this investment in your personal appearance because
[3730.40 --> 3737.20]  straight teeth is about more than just looks it's a it's like a an indicator of class and it will give you more
[3737.20 --> 3741.76]  success in life and i was like whoa mom that is like some hardcore
[3741.76 --> 3748.40]  that's deep that is like some hardcore stuff to be talking about and like that's kind of like a
[3748.40 --> 3757.84]  really weird reason to get braces for your kid but it's it's also i i don't make the rules for how the
[3757.84 --> 3763.60]  world works she's not wrong um and you know how parents tend to have an attitude that they want their
[3763.60 --> 3769.92]  kids to have opportunities that they that they didn't enjoy and so for her this was one of those things
[3769.92 --> 3777.04]  that was like no you absolutely need to you absolutely need to have straight teeth because
[3777.04 --> 3785.68]  people will judge you they will judge so much about you based on your smile and i i had a very significant
[3785.68 --> 3792.72]  overbite which combined with my already kind of large two front teeth um i think it looked kind of like
[3792.72 --> 3799.76]  this i i can't even do it anymore because part of the correction was i used to have an overbite that was like
[3799.76 --> 3805.36]  this big like i kid you not i could take like i could take the tops off of cans and stuff with my
[3805.36 --> 3811.28]  front teeth i'll be like oh yeah i shouldn't you shouldn't do that kids that probably wasn't good
[3811.84 --> 3816.40]  not a good idea but like i could put my pinky finger in the gap between my bottom teeth and my
[3816.40 --> 3822.08]  front teeth like all the way up there like a huge overbite and um so one of the things that i got was
[3822.08 --> 3828.32]  these bite blocks that slide your lower jaw forward and it's been annoying because my teeth don't like
[3829.12 --> 3836.32]  like they don't mesh up perfectly anymore like they kind of meet like this and like like it's weird
[3836.32 --> 3840.48]  because my jaw has been moved so much like it's it kind of cracks sometimes and stuff like it's
[3840.48 --> 3848.56]  it's not like it's perfect but it looks way better like my smile's not obviously way crooked and
[3848.56 --> 3858.40]  uh and like hugely overbitten and stuff um so yeah teeth i would do and i did i'm just trying to
[3858.40 --> 3864.80]  think of like what else i could i've never personally until literally this stream i have never counted
[3864.80 --> 3871.92]  teeth but they're the same thing it for sure i'm not against i'm just it's not something i considered i
[3871.92 --> 3877.76]  never thought of braces as like because i i had braces growing up too and for uh the parents
[3878.40 --> 3883.92]  probably financial situations and reasons were kind of pretty in line like didn't really have
[3883.92 --> 3891.52]  the money for it um but like i know i i remember i don't remember the conversation as vividly but i
[3891.52 --> 3895.36]  remember some of the reasons being kind of similar like this is going to be important later yeah we
[3895.36 --> 3900.96]  need to do it now it's expensive but we want to do it right it's an investment in like your future is
[3900.96 --> 3907.20]  kind of your future this is very important and i hated it and it bugs me like crazy that's funny i was
[3907.20 --> 3914.40]  super into it anyways i used to like now right no no no i i got braces when i was like uh i i went to
[3914.40 --> 3922.56]  i went man my first day of high school i showed up with braces and fluorescent pink hair um it was i
[3922.56 --> 3927.52]  didn't mind the braces from like a social standpoint thing i didn't care about that i found them annoying
[3927.52 --> 3932.16]  um and i think after quite a while having them i got much more used to it but they're really annoying
[3932.16 --> 3937.36]  at first i still have a bar below my behind my lower teeth i actually love that because i scratch
[3937.36 --> 3942.24]  my tongue on it all the time theoretically they're taking that out when i'm like 40 something and i
[3942.24 --> 3948.16]  don't even want them to it's probably gonna be super weird you know what i think made me so enthusiastic
[3948.16 --> 3954.64]  about it i told my mom and i told my orthodontist one thing i said please no headgear and they tried to
[3954.64 --> 3959.52]  talk me into it they were like well you know what if you only had to wear it for so many days a
[3959.52 --> 3965.60]  week or so many hours a day or whatever i was like please no headgear they found a way to do it
[3965.60 --> 3973.92]  without headgear and that made me extremely happy and so i was just like i was all in um like i completed
[3973.92 --> 3978.48]  my appliances was what the things to slide my jaw forward i completed them so much faster than they
[3978.48 --> 3983.12]  expected because they're like yeah crank the thing once a week it was like to widen my palette
[3983.12 --> 3987.12]  and move my so i had to widen my whole jaw actually oh i forgot about that part right i had to
[3987.12 --> 3991.68]  widen my jaw because i had no um no space you can see i don't have enough space here still
[3991.68 --> 3998.00]  and they actually had to disc some of my teeth disking even compared to the cavity drill is the
[3998.00 --> 4004.00]  most unpleasant dental experience i have ever had in my life and i've had my i've had my bottom wisdom
[4004.00 --> 4012.72]  teeth out they take we're so far off of tech it is exactly what it sounds like luke they take pretty
[4012.72 --> 4021.28]  much a dremel and they grind between your teeth it's like they slip it's the most it's the most
[4021.28 --> 4027.12]  terrifying like bone that's uncomfortable and i don't think it'll ever happen to me that's still so
[4027.12 --> 4033.52]  uncomfortable yeah oh my god and i okay i did wisdom teeth out while i was awake okay and disking was
[4033.52 --> 4040.88]  worse it was it was 20 years ago luke and i still remember i still get like the hair standing up on the
[4040.88 --> 4048.16]  back of my neck when i think about it it's so disgusting i hated it um yeah i don't i don't
[4048.16 --> 4053.20]  know what else like i kind of embrace my giant nose at this point i still remember having just the
[4053.20 --> 4062.96]  funniest conversation with my mom where um i forget exactly how it went but um she basically said like
[4064.00 --> 4070.08]  you know i never noticed before but you have a really big nose and i was like really because you
[4070.08 --> 4077.20]  never look at yourself from the side and so i like yeah i like got my digital camera at the time and i
[4077.20 --> 4085.36]  like took a picture myself from the side i was like wow i have like a honking big nose but i'm like i'm
[4085.36 --> 4092.88]  into it i'm okay with it i i call i call it a royal nose you know like it's a regal nose dominant nose
[4093.44 --> 4097.68]  i mean it's the only thing on my body that's like you know big for my size right so i gotta
[4100.08 --> 4101.36]  i gotta stick with it you know
[4105.68 --> 4111.20]  oh no oh geez gotta you gotta enjoy the small victories this month
[4113.76 --> 4118.32]  oh my goodness it's like if it was like it was down to who had the biggest nose and the smaller
[4118.32 --> 4127.20]  nose gets voted off the island i have a chance you know victory yes um all right i i don't know i've
[4127.20 --> 4135.20]  always thought that i would like maybe um fix things i don't know like if i was in an accident
[4135.20 --> 4143.36]  or something oh yeah yeah i would i'd want to be myself yeah exactly i'd like to restore um and okay
[4143.36 --> 4150.56]  so on that note then okay fine like it comes down to those kinds of like those philosophical like those
[4150.56 --> 4155.84]  deep questions those 3 a.m questions you know like what age would you be if you were in heaven man
[4156.72 --> 4163.60]  right so like what is your true self is it yeah is it your 18 year old self your 25 year old self
[4163.60 --> 4169.20]  your 36 year old self who knows right so like what is yourself so from that perspective whether it's the
[4169.20 --> 4174.72]  ravages of a bike accident or whether it's the ravages of time is it any more or less wrong i don't
[4174.72 --> 4179.04]  know i'm not in a position to answer that question okay well i think that yeah i think that's an individual
[4179.04 --> 4183.84]  thing you got to answer that for yourself yeah i can't think of i can't think of much else that
[4183.84 --> 4188.96]  i would change i mean my eyes are super uneven which is something that i also mostly notice when
[4188.96 --> 4193.28]  i'm on like a cheap webcam because there tends to be a little bit more lens distortion and i'll be
[4193.28 --> 4198.72]  like oh yeah right oh yeah that's my ears are uneven too they're off by like this much like it's
[4198.72 --> 4202.96]  quite substantial and i think my eyes are too so i have to kind of hold if you look okay i'll go right
[4202.96 --> 4208.24]  in front of the camera here so i have to hold my head at this angle for my eyes to be level
[4208.24 --> 4209.84]  so you'll never be able to unsee it now
[4212.96 --> 4217.04]  i honestly i can barely even i don't think you can really fix that you don't like notice
[4217.04 --> 4221.76]  these things about people like i never really noticed if people's ears or eyes are off or like
[4221.76 --> 4226.16]  if they like i i didn't know that you had a big nose until you told me that you had a big nose i
[4226.16 --> 4230.96]  don't even remember when that was but like i know that you have a big nose still only now because i know
[4230.96 --> 4236.56]  that you've told me like i've never really visually noticed it i don't know a really fun one um i
[4236.56 --> 4240.88]  remember doing this with like a friend years and years ago is you take a picture of yourself and
[4240.88 --> 4248.64]  then you copy paste like the mirror image of both of them and you everyone has everyone has a good
[4248.64 --> 4254.24]  side 100 like one of my sides i was like dang and the other side i was like ew
[4254.24 --> 4263.12]  oh we got people in chat decide that you always want to like if you have to have a side profile
[4263.12 --> 4268.24]  like the one that you want i don't remember what mine is but i have one too uh people are like what
[4268.24 --> 4276.08]  is this stream even i'm not 100 um face facebook will be uh forcing compulsory information sharing
[4276.08 --> 4281.76]  for whatsapp uh so there's a whole bunch of stuff information to be collected includes user phone numbers
[4281.76 --> 4285.68]  other people's phone numbers and stored address books profile names profile picture status
[4285.68 --> 4291.76]  messages including when a user was last online diagnostic data collected from app logs um well
[4291.76 --> 4297.12]  that we should like we should like take a minute on the wan show and just like get everyone that's
[4297.12 --> 4303.36]  watching to uninstall it i'm gonna do it right now i'm uninstalling it right now a spokeswoman
[4303.36 --> 4307.92]  to ars technica said this is part of a previously disclosed move to allow businesses to store and
[4307.92 --> 4313.92]  manage whatsapp chats using facebook's infrastructure wow the new privacy policy in terms of service are
[4313.92 --> 4320.24]  full are now more than 8 000 words long and filled with legal jargon and it does not apply in europe
[4320.24 --> 4325.76]  due to stronger privacy legislation there good job europe all right so i think i'm going to try and get
[4325.76 --> 4331.44]  the people that i use that i talk with a lot to switch to signal we'll move to signal for our family and
[4331.44 --> 4338.16]  uh and hope that hope that that lasts um i can't remember which one's better signal or telegram you
[4338.16 --> 4343.60]  said you were into signal right now i like signal i've been using signal for for quite some time now
[4343.60 --> 4349.44]  um i have also heard very good things about telegram i i'm not gonna war one against the other
[4349.44 --> 4358.48]  necessarily but i i like signal cool uh all right ikea created furniture for the next gen consoles this is
[4358.48 --> 4365.92]  pretty sick this is posted by soldier underscore ph on the forums there they are which ikea media
[4365.92 --> 4372.32]  storage unit will be able to fit my new uh memishly oversized gaming console haha there's no way that's
[4372.32 --> 4379.04]  the actual thing in ikea wait is it really memishly you've got to be kidding me there's no way that's
[4379.04 --> 4384.64]  got to be like uh like a mock-up or fake thing or something uh okay at any rate we've got a couple
[4384.64 --> 4388.40]  more things to go through real quick but uh the tyler memorial stream is supposed to be starting in
[4388.40 --> 4394.00]  like nine minutes so we got to go very soon here um trump was censored on various social media sites
[4394.00 --> 4400.56]  so that happened oh wait breaking news he got a perma ban on twitter as of 3 22 today seriously
[4401.60 --> 4408.80]  perma man i didn't think they would ever do it yep i heard about that after close review of recent
[4408.80 --> 4412.96]  tweets from the at real donald trump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the
[4412.96 --> 4418.72]  account due to the risk of further incitement of violence look at that wow so that's what it i have
[4418.72 --> 4426.32]  been using twitter less and less over time so i heard about it but didn't even check shopify took
[4426.32 --> 4432.48]  down some stores twitch and snapchat disabled uh the president's accounts uh facebook and instagram
[4432.48 --> 4440.96]  banned um from posting for at least the next two weeks uh crazy apple has threatened to remove parlor
[4440.96 --> 4446.40]  a social media platform popular with many of trump's supporters from the app store within 24 hours if
[4446.40 --> 4456.64]  the app doesn't begin moderating or removing extremist content dang it's like huh that's crazy
[4457.44 --> 4463.20]  people have been talking about parlor and and a couple other apps similar i i believe similar to
[4463.20 --> 4467.04]  parlor over the last little bit and i've just been kind of thinking this whole time like
[4467.04 --> 4473.28]  like they're i'm sure they have websites i've never used them but they're they're from my understanding
[4473.28 --> 4479.20]  very app based and that still means that you're beholden to the the platforms that distribute the
[4479.20 --> 4487.28]  app yes you're not you're you're you're still you you still have to deal with something else that can
[4487.28 --> 4492.08]  censor your your platform so i've been kind of waiting for this to happen and i'm very unsurprised
[4492.08 --> 4497.76]  reddit has also reported that they have taken action to ban the community r slash donald trump
[4497.76 --> 4501.60]  giving the repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the u.s capitol
[4502.48 --> 4506.72]  interesting that's not an official group or page even it's it's a community one and i'm
[4507.36 --> 4514.56]  quite surprised that they've uh that they've taken that step every everything related to this seems
[4514.56 --> 4520.00]  especially from the outside very surprisingly coordinated like this all seems very surprisingly coordinated
[4520.00 --> 4523.44]  and so does all the stuff that happened at the capitol but i don't i don't think we should
[4523.44 --> 4531.44]  necessarily get into that i'm not i'm just i'm just baffled that compared to you know a lot of other
[4531.44 --> 4536.88]  stuff that happened in the last four years and like a lot of other people that have died in the last
[4536.88 --> 4545.92]  four years that all of a sudden it's a big deal now um yeah go figure what a world we live in isn't it
[4545.92 --> 4552.88]  it it's quite odd uh but in other news uh switch modders find evidence of a switch pro in the latest
[4552.88 --> 4557.44]  switch update and 4k in docked mode may be a possibility that's all there is to really say
[4557.44 --> 4563.28]  about that um yeah let's not talk about that you think they have actual dock hardware now
[4565.36 --> 4571.12]  um dock pro oh because this was something we were talking before the switch came out
[4571.12 --> 4574.96]  um this is like before the original switch came out this is something i believe we talked about on
[4574.96 --> 4579.20]  wanshow i believe you and i debated about whether or not there would be hardware in the dock like an
[4579.20 --> 4584.96]  upscaler or anything else um and it ended up not being true i don't remember which side either of us
[4584.96 --> 4591.20]  were on about that topic but i think i wanted it to be true but i don't remember what i actually thought
[4591.20 --> 4598.96]  was going to happen um but this might be it now there might be a dock pro um if it's going to act
[4598.96 --> 4606.56]  differently when it's docked i don't know maybe all right sure i gotta run because i uh have to
[4606.56 --> 4612.64]  troubleshoot ivan's webcam for the stream today i will do just a couple super chats here there were a
[4612.64 --> 4618.24]  couple that were like really big you guys are crazy you shouldn't send big super chats um but thank you
