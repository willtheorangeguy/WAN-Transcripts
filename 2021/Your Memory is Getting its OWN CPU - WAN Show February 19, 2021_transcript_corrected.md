[0.16 → 6.48] Yo what's up guys welcome to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[6.48 → 13.28] lots of good topics the big headline is of course the news that Samsung's HBM2 memory is going to be
[13.28 → 20.64] coming with artificial intelligence and it no, no but no it doesn't seem to be a buzzword like the
[20.64 → 27.60] tech here looks incredibly cool we've also this is what Musk warned us about first you're gonna
[27.60 → 33.28] get AI memory next your computer's going to build its own legs and arms and and and take over hey
[33.28 → 37.68] this is the beginning of the end it might be a good thing because as you guys saw in our video
[37.68 → 45.52] yesterday computers are probably better off if they build themselves famous twitch streamer QC
[45.52 → 53.76] apparently has watched my reaction to his build so we're going to see how many layers of watchception we
[53.76 → 59.84] can go into here um where maybe on the show I don't know if he's actually done a response of
[59.84 → 68.72] any sort, but maybe we'll watch him watch me watch him watch me watch him this should all culminate
[68.72 → 74.24] with you guys both watching the original video together ooh that could be it, or we could actually
[74.24 → 80.00] just build him a computer because at this point it's becoming painful what else we got lined up today
[80.00 → 87.68] NVIDIA works Ethereum mining performance on specifically the RTX 3060. That's interesting
[87.68 → 95.36] not anything else talk about that more later also Facebook blocks all news posts in Australia and
[95.36 → 103.92] Canada considering link tax legislation due to considering link tax legislation wow you have to be like
[103.92 → 110.32] that hey okay man only there was another option like not using Facebook any more we can't block mark
[110.32 → 129.60] soil, but he can block our soil is that how it's going to be all right that's fine just fine let's roll that intro
[133.92 → 144.16] and the show is brought to you today by someone I actually can't remember who hey there we go remote
[144.16 → 152.64] HQ ridge wallet and squaw space why don't we jump right into our headline topic because people get
[152.64 → 158.00] real upset when we don't do that and this was reported on Tom's hardware samsung.com also was
[158.00 → 163.68] talking about it a little bit since it's kind of a Samsung technology Samsung is claiming to have the
[163.68 → 173.92] industry's first high bandwidth memory so that's HBM memory with integrated AI processors, and it sounds
[173.92 → 182.80] like buzzword bull spit honestly like doesn't it yes absolutely yes well this is our monitor with AI
[182.80 → 191.76] and our and our memory with AI and our water bottle with AI it's going to be like oh Linus must be thirsty
[191.76 → 197.28] and it'll have like a little thing that actually that's kind of a genius product idea a water bottle
[197.28 → 201.68] that just like flashes well no you totally don't need an AI I think they also have this already did
[201.68 → 204.72] they have it and just like flashes when you're supposed to drink yeah of course they do it's
[204.72 → 211.44] probably it knows how it knows how depleted the bottle is, and it like barks so, so anyway so that's
[211.44 → 220.88] the point there's AI in basically everything but this looks and sounds incredibly cool so what the point
[220.88 → 227.12] of having processing in memory or PIM is that it's supposed to help accelerate processing within
[227.12 → 236.88] data centres by doing some processing on the memory rather than waiting for that in relative terms high
[236.88 → 244.16] latency link between the CPU and memory for a transaction to be completed so PIM basically just
[244.16 → 250.72] eliminates another link in the data chain by putting this dram optimized AI inside each memory
[250.72 → 260.80] bank now obviously you know conventional dram is optimized more for well okay a performance but b density
[260.80 → 267.04] so you want to squeeze as much dram as you possibly can into the die area that you have available in
[267.04 → 274.08] order to maximize your value right, but you're going to take a hit here in terms of capacity so we
[274.08 → 279.68] can fire up the original article from Tom's hardware here we go let me just uh screen share with
[279.68 → 286.56] you guys for a second here so check this out inside okay presents the first details the cam from dram
[286.56 → 293.28] with pc block fabricated into the 20 nanometre dram process so where is it uh yes there we go
[293.28 → 304.80] uh so here they are so these are these PCU blocks right here for the different banks of memory
[305.52 → 315.12] that is like super cool so what you're going to end up with then is instead of an eight gig so where you
[315.12 → 323.04] would normally have an eight gig stack of HBM or eight uh eight gig eight gigabyte stacks by combining
[323.04 → 333.76] four gigabit dies with PCUS with four eight gigabit dies without PCUS oh okay so where you would
[333.76 → 341.52] normally have eight gigabytes worth of memory in a stack you will now get six gigabytes of memory, and they're
[341.52 → 353.60] going to be combining okay wow man Siri I'm not talking to you, it's incredible how often that thing
[353.60 → 360.24] goes off when I'm not actually talking to it, so this requires Samsung's existing hbm2 aqua bolt
[360.24 → 365.36] architecture to properly take advantage of the hardware improvement, but they claim it can offer over
[365.36 → 371.84] a two-time system performance improvement with a reduction of over 70 percent in power consumption
[372.72 → 380.32] and with time that's got to be just for the memory right uh i would certainly can't be with
[380.32 → 384.32] the system as a whole they're phrasing it like it sounds like they're talking about system as a whole
[384.32 → 390.24] but there's no way um and the craziest part about this and this is like often you'll read about these
[390.24 → 398.80] kinds of breakthroughs like oh we created a carbon NATO tube hard drive DNA storage or whatever the
[398.80 → 405.76] case may be, and it's something that's literally just uh sci-fi pretty much, but they got kind of close
[405.76 → 412.00] to it in a lab uh unlike those things Samsung says that this advancement doesn't require any other
[412.00 → 422.24] hardware or software changes so the memory just yeah it will intelligently know what to work on and
[422.24 → 427.84] what not to work on making it just an easy choice for anyone who wants to gain a massive improvement
[427.84 → 434.64] in performance per watt in existing systems, so this could be this could be huge for all kinds of
[434.64 → 440.56] industries high performance computing and the scientific community uh so because quickly moving large
[440.56 → 446.40] amounts of data should no longer be bottlenecked as severely by memory bandwidth so they'll be
[446.40 → 454.80] presenting their paper a 20 nanometre 6 gigabyte function in memory DRAM based on hbm2 with a 1.2
[454.80 → 459.20] teraflops programmable computing unit using bank level parallelism for machine learning applications
[459.20 → 466.64] that is actually the name of the paper um at the international solid state circuits virtual conference
[466.64 → 472.40] which begins on February 22nd so it's currently being tested inside AI accelerators I wouldn't
[472.40 → 478.64] expect to see this in a GPU for example anytime soon, but validation is expected to be completed by
[478.64 → 485.12] summer of this year which means we could actually see these things deployed within like a year or so
[485.92 → 493.12] that's pretty freaking incredible i i I don't know man sometimes I guess I'm a little bit too
[493.12 → 498.24] inside the box thinking, but this is not the kind of thing that I would have seen coming I mean we
[498.24 → 503.68] talk about a lot of kinds of you know future tech we do a lot of future crafting on this show and
[503.68 → 509.12] just in general just when we're talking but like this is not putting c so you got your
[509.12 → 515.52] CPU right, and then you got your memory and your CPU you got your like yours ram and then now you're gonna
[515.52 → 521.04] take your ram, and you're going to put like a little CPU in that, and then it's like at what point do you just
[521.04 → 528.24] have all CPUs and all memories and then and then the memory on the CPU gets bigger and then the CPU
[528.24 → 533.84] and the memory gets bigger and then now you've got two CPUs and two memories running a cluster Siri I'm
[533.84 → 541.20] not talking to you go away i yeah I had mentioned in the pre-show, and you got me to stuff it um because
[541.20 → 548.56] we need content I did say that but what I was saying was that if we're we're progressing even further
[548.56 → 552.56] beyond the like computers and computers thing that I've talked about way in the past I was
[552.56 → 556.08] talking about how GPUs are essentially just a computer within your computer that just handles
[556.08 → 562.56] a thing yeah yeah um, and we're going even further than that SSDs are totally like that compared to
[562.56 → 569.20] hard drives the controller on a hard drive even like sort of there but SSDs are just way further the
[569.20 → 575.36] controller on a hard drive is dumb as toast compared to the controller on a SSD like I mean Samsung i
[575.36 → 583.52] think what are those like triple core arm processors i i i um I was using a SSD for a build today that
[583.52 → 591.68] has literally two gigabytes of ddr4 memory on it like it has this right that's a motherboard and a
[591.68 → 598.96] processor and memory exactly and storage yeah it's got storage because it's off because it's a SSD for
[598.96 → 604.32] crying out loud yeah so it's just a bunch of little computers that you're making work together exactly
[604.32 → 610.40] like what in your what in your computer is not a computer yet um your power supply I would make
[610.40 → 616.16] the argument is not really a computer there's some pretty advanced ones that have like microcontroller
[616.16 → 622.80] grade you know processing capabilities but i I wouldn't call that I wouldn't call that like a CPU
[622.80 → 629.12] whereas you know that SSD that I was talking about Samsung 980 pro like it's got full-on like arm core
[629.12 → 637.28] processors in it like conceivably it could do a lot more than just you know decide uh which
[637.28 → 643.20] parts of the flash to retire and how to handle garbage collection to maintain adequate performance
[643.20 → 649.36] right like it's its pretty advanced its doing stuff yeah some serious stuff yeah I don't know it's
[649.36 → 654.96] it's interesting i uh ram is definitely not the next spot I expected to receive this, but it makes this
[654.96 → 660.56] it makes a lot of sense i just definitely didn't see it coming very cool yeah the funky thing
[660.56 → 666.72] for me is just like from a from like a software side, but then they claim it's just kind of it just
[666.72 → 673.68] kind of automagically works so I just don't I don't really get it like from a software side of
[673.68 → 683.84] things what is it how does that processor know what to work on yeah i it's way above my head I have no
[683.84 → 691.12] idea okay it sounds cool i I suspect we'll learn a lot more uh during that paper presentation that i
[691.12 → 697.04] believe you mentioned um on February 22nd we're definitely going to have to do some kind of update on
[697.04 → 701.44] this is the kind of thing where if we could get our hands on any of this kind of stuff we'd love to
[701.44 → 707.20] do a full LTT just diving into this learning about if it's one of this the kind of thing that like
[707.20 → 711.36] I'll bring up in writer's meeting and everyone's going to be like me me me I don't know I want to
[711.36 → 718.16] work on that one because it's just so cool because it's just not the way that I think about the
[718.16 → 727.60] relationship between a central processor and ram so ram from my understanding holds the data that the CPU
[727.60 → 738.00] needs to work on so then like what the CPU would say hey I need to work on this thing and then the
[738.00 → 744.40] ram would then maybe they could grab it and start sending it like ahead of time I don't know predict
[744.40 → 751.04] that perform some kind of function that it anticipates the CPU will want to and then proactively return
[751.04 → 757.76] that result like what story how does this work I have no even sort of a clue but I'm excited for
[757.76 → 764.32] February 22nd yeah really cool there's honestly not that many things these days with like desktop
[764.32 → 771.28] computers where I'm like holy crap that could be potentially like absolutely freaking amazing
[771.28 → 774.16] and this could be one of them well still not desktop, so there's that
[774.16 → 782.64] fair speaking of desktops hey, hey I've actually got um wait no did i tell you this already
[782.64 → 789.60] did I tell you about your uh your personal rig update that we're going to be doing yes okay did I
[789.60 → 794.96] know some amount of it did I tell the audience about this yet I think you might have told them sort of
[794.96 → 800.16] i actually don't know if I did guys you're going to have to tell me because I've got quite a few
[800.16 → 806.16] more details about what we're going to be doing so we apparently oh we apparently talked about last
[806.16 → 810.00] man's show oh forget it oh man okay I thought I was all excited okay well that's fine because we've
[810.00 → 816.16] got other stuff to talk about uh we actually filmed the video for flow plane this week all right no lets
[816.16 → 822.16] talk about that later lets talk first about NVIDIA working Ethereum mining performance on the upcoming
[822.16 → 828.88] RTX 3060. Luke do you want to talk us through this one because i have to tell you out I don't want to talk
[828.88 → 836.08] about it because yeah I think you just need to mute Anthony and I worked on a video about this topic
[836.08 → 841.60] where I'm going to be sharing my thoughts and his thoughts kind of interspersed a lot of people don't
[841.60 → 848.08] really understand this concept but um I've actually been accused at times of you know the
[848.08 → 853.60] April fools we did where it was like hashtag lie nus like I don't actually know anything about computers
[853.60 → 857.92] and I don't really contribute anything it's all a big show um a lot of people don't realize this but when
[857.92 → 867.84] you see a writing credit at the end of a LTT video um 90 probably 97 of the time uh I had a
[867.84 → 874.80] heavy hand in editing what that was so if there was a joke in like an Anthony scripted video that you
[874.80 → 880.64] thought you know was really stupid uh don't necessarily blame Anthony it's its very possible
[880.64 → 885.44] that it was me who put that in because I actually review the scripts word by word with our
[885.44 → 890.64] writers before I go up and go like this so it's one of the ways that we make sure that even
[890.64 → 896.64] though I have a writing staff everything that I'm saying is reflective of how I actually feel about the
[896.64 → 902.96] product and that's one of the reasons why sometimes in the script we will have dissenting opinions I might
[902.96 → 908.80] say well this is what I thought of the keyboard but Alex whose fingers are longer than mine thought
[908.80 → 914.40] that that was just fine or thought it was way worse or whatever the case may be so you're going to hear
[914.40 → 922.40] mine and Anthony's combined take on this um tomorrow don't miss that video because I might not agree
[922.40 → 927.04] with what Luke's about to say I am now hitting the mute button like a good little boy Luke why don't
[927.04 → 931.68] you talk us through what's going on here I just want to say oh I just minimized all of my windows by
[931.68 → 937.44] accident by shaking that that individual one uh I want to say by uh just at the beginning of this to
[937.44 → 944.40] start it off uh that the opening note for this is fantastic there 's's Anthony young note and
[944.40 → 951.04] then highlighted the yellow Linus do not rent and then period and then highlighted red do not rent
[951.92 → 958.56] you have a video coming out tomorrow you're specifically not allowed he has to mute um I feel
[958.56 → 962.72] like I could say anything I'm on top of the world right now but instead I'm going to talk about this
[962.72 → 968.96] graphics card so just the RTX 3060 this is not coming to other graphics cards apparently my bird
[968.96 → 975.36] is joining me in this conversation um in an attempt or an effort to get these cards into the
[975.36 → 981.60] hands of people that they were at least originally intended for uh they are releasing drivers or i
[981.60 → 990.40] believe all the drivers uh will nerf Ethereum hash rates by roughly 50 percent it's a driver which I find
[990.40 → 996.80] quite interesting that might be by passable um the RTX 3060 software drivers are designed to detect
[996.80 → 1002.00] specific attributes of the Ethereum cryptocurrency mining algorithm and limit the hash rate or
[1002.00 → 1007.92] cryptocurrency mining efficiency by around 50 that's a direct quote this will not affect 3070 through 3090
[1007.92 → 1016.00] cards as I mentioned this is specifically just RTX 3060 this announcement comes alongside the release of new
[1016.00 → 1022.40] CMP or cryptocurrency mining platform cards we've seen this type of stuff in the past I don't remember
[1022.40 → 1028.48] what specific card it was, but it doesn't have output on it, you can't plug a monitor into if it's just for
[1028.48 → 1033.76] compute um these cards yeah these cards lack any display output capabilities and are built solely for
[1033.76 → 1039.92] mining NVIDIA has stated that these cards will not affect availability of 30 series cards for gamers
[1039.92 → 1045.68] um maybe not current availability, but you probably could have used that manufacturing for them let's just
[1045.68 → 1050.96] ignore that part um although exactly how they can produce more chips on the same node without
[1050.96 → 1056.32] affecting RTX output remains to be seen yeah exactly uh while CMP pricing is unavailable at this time the
[1056.32 → 1063.84] performance and watt numbers of the top tier card the 90hx are noticeably lower than what a 3080 can
[1063.84 → 1073.92] achieve 86 megahertz per second at 320 watts versus 100 megahertz mega hash sorry 86 mega hash per second at 320 watts
[1073.92 → 1082.16] versus 100 megahertz this means a 3080 doesn't just perform better it does so more efficiently
[1083.28 → 1090.32] womp it also it's also a much easier card to re it's also much easier to resell a 3080 than it is to
[1090.32 → 1096.96] resell old mining hardware meaning miners can recoup more of their costs if they have the more GPU focused
[1096.96 → 1103.76] one for gamers than the actual mining specific card uh pricing and availability are really going to be the
[1103.76 → 1108.24] deciding factor on this it's already hard enough to buy 3000 series cards uh these are probably going
[1108.24 → 1114.24] to disappear as well so who knows we'll see what happens there um and in semi-related news Anthony
[1114.24 → 1120.72] included a link to a picture of total just showing like a mining rig with a bunch of their cards
[1122.64 → 1128.96] apparently gamers were cheesed about that one um but I don't know like it's
[1128.96 → 1138.24] it's i it might not have been uh the most wise PR move to post that picture but like they know what's
[1138.24 → 1143.92] going on and I guarantee you that picture didn't change anything no, no one's going to build a mining rig
[1143.92 → 1147.52] because they specifically saw that picture I seriously doubt that's going to happen so like it
[1147.52 → 1153.12] doesn't matter but I do understand why people are riled up they want their cards and their heart their
[1153.12 → 1159.68] cards are hard to get but yeah that's about it, you can unmute, but you're still not allowed to talk
[1159.68 → 1170.24] about it thanks Luke no prob great job Luke heck yeah all right lets uh why don't we move on then why
[1170.24 → 1178.56] don't we move on uh we actually had a great video go up on float plane earlier this week i i know to
[1178.56 → 1184.72] the Wang show audience I generally don't spend a ton of time pimping float plane because I know most
[1184.72 → 1191.68] of you guys already know about LE float plane but if you are not already subscribed on LE float plane
[1191.68 → 1196.88] this one is probably one of the ones that's worth it for early access one quick second before you keep
[1196.88 → 1202.80] going someone said I want to hear the rant tune in for the video yeah that was the whole point yes
[1202.80 → 1208.96] the video is going to be up probably about 10 a.m pacific tomorrow yeah it's coming tomorrow you
[1208.96 → 1214.48] really don't have to wait very long when I left the office Anthony and Nicole were working on the final
[1214.48 → 1220.24] pass of just like making sure all the eyes are dotted and the t's are dotted, and the other eyes are crossed
[1220.24 → 1228.00] and all that kind of thing so let's go ahead and chuck this on here we went, and we bought uh probably a
[1228.00 → 1239.84] few hundred dollars worth of counterfeits oh counterfeit Linus merch that's right we went, and we got our hands
[1239.84 → 1248.96] on as much fake lttstore.com swag as we possibly could and one of our viewers on float plane this is ados
[1249.52 → 1257.04] asked us are we planning to go after the counterfeit merch suppliers because honestly some of it is
[1257.04 → 1265.28] pretty shameless uh if we go on Amazon for example and search for Linus tech tips uh you're going to see
[1265.28 → 1274.80] here that there is an absolute ton of stuff we don't make an I don't know why they're calling it a balaclava
[1275.44 → 1281.20] because that's clearly just a regular face mask anyway we don't make a face mask we haven't sold
[1281.20 → 1286.80] anything with this logo in years we've actually never sold anything with the wan logo and the
[1286.80 → 1295.36] old Linus tech tips logo combined this is clearly the same rip-off design but in orange um i I don't
[1295.36 → 1303.36] know what w Oudh is but I can pretty much guarantee you it's nothing to do with Linus media group
[1303.36 → 1314.96] incorporated so yeah they're uh the media men's l dash minus t dash ch to dash boxer briefs yeah uh
[1315.84 → 1321.12] I'm pretty sure we got our hands on something from these guys' spoiler alert they're absolutely
[1321.12 → 1327.12] atrocious they're like the worst thing ever I mean a lot of this stuff you can just tell from the
[1327.12 → 1331.76] picture that it's just a cheesy Photoshop they didn't even they couldn't even be bothered to
[1331.76 → 1339.20] centre the Photoshop um man we actually wow we actually didn't get like all of it although okay in
[1339.20 → 1346.08] fairness to Sarah who was the one who sourced most of this stuff um a lot of these vendors will start
[1346.08 → 1354.00] up and then disappear before you even get a chance to go after them because they know they obviously
[1354.00 → 1359.04] know that they're infringing someone else's trademark or someone else's copyright, and they're doing it
[1359.04 → 1364.48] anyway and so it's clearly just built into their business model that they're going to have to spin up
[1364.48 → 1371.28] these stores and then shut them down when someone actually does go after them so in response then
[1371.28 → 1379.36] to your in response then to your question no at this time we don't have any reason to believe that
[1379.36 → 1387.12] they're moving any kind of significant volume of these products um almost none of them have any reviews on
[1387.12 → 1397.36] Amazon whatsoever and of the ones that do um one of them has a two-star review that's it actually I would
[1397.36 → 1402.96] I would love to have a look at this my shirt was nowhere near the size I ordered even though it said so
[1402.96 → 1410.56] on the shirt also the stitching was coming out on one sleeve when I got it not impressed says Gary a
[1410.56 → 1417.28] well look moral of the story if you want to be impressed by the quality of Linus tech tips merch

[1423.04 → 1431.68] so big true good effort but you played yourself you 100 played yourself oh man that's what are you
[1431.68 → 1436.72] going to do with the QC watched our video thing are you going to watch his watching of your video I don't
[1436.72 → 1443.92] actually know if I don't actually know if he watched it on stream does anyone oh does anyone have
[1443.92 → 1450.24] like uh I'm sure twitch chat's going to blow up as soon as they figure out that we're talking about this
[1450.24 → 1456.24] apparently he did watch it on stream so does anyone have like a time stamp for me or a clip or anything
[1456.24 → 1461.68] like that I don't I don't know anyone clip it hopefully someone can throw something in the
[1461.68 → 1465.52] twitch chat actually here Luke do you want to keep an eye on the chat maybe float plane chat guys

[1725.60 → 1732.24] different URL potentially okay well whatever I'll let Colton know and hopefully he
[1732.24 → 1738.00] can fix it after the fact okay not going to spend any more time on that okay so what I'm looking at
[1738.00 → 1745.28] here is uh blitz it should be a time stamped twitch oh I see that must have just been the name of his
[1745.28 → 1754.56] stream that is like wow that is a toxic poisonous uh stream name like exclamation mark
[1754.56 → 1762.64] exclamation mark blazon number one watch party location overwatch 2 pause champ question mark i just
[1762.64 → 1769.44] I don't even I don't even know what I'm looking at I'm I click them I click this thing and I'm prompted
[1769.44 → 1776.56] do you really do you want to go here I don't know I don't know the answer to that question, so this is it
[1776.56 → 1785.44] this is this is the pause chamber extreme uh let's get here there we go we got twitch chat we
[1785.44 → 1795.04] got I have no idea um what to expect here but okay, okay guys I'm reacting to his reaction this is reacception
[1795.04 → 1800.00] uh oh now I'm reacting to his reaction to my reaction build stream reaction
[1800.00 → 1805.68] the kind of person who piles on when somebody's already having a bad time but here's the situation
[1805.68 → 1811.76] okay streamer QC reached out to me a number of weeks back asking for help with a new gaming pc
[1811.76 → 1817.12] I pointed out that I'm sure anyone and their dog would be happy to send him a free gaming pc in exchange
[1817.12 → 1823.12] for a tweet given his popularity but I did offer my help if you really needed it and then i promptly
[1823.76 → 1829.60] never heard anything about it ever again guys in my detail chat guys this is how I treat the
[1829.60 → 1837.20] okay other people this is not it says anything about them okay it's just it's just a life philosophy
[1837.76 → 1844.48] I feel bad people that have to interact with me okay, but this is how bigger streamers uh celebrity Indies
[1845.60 → 1853.04] whoa whoa hold on a second did he just say he can't reply to an email because he's to stream
[1853.04 → 1859.44] famous did I just did I just hear that correctly we got I'm not sure he either
[1859.44 → 1863.84] said that, or he was saying that like it doesn't necessarily matter who it is I'm just bad at
[1863.84 → 1870.80] communication I'm not really sure which one he did okay hold on a second hold on okay let's let's
[1870.80 → 1875.92] let's get this let's get this back going here all the YouTubers smaller this is how anybody interacts
[1875.92 → 1879.44] with me dude this is just how it's just how I deal with things I don't know why it's just how it is
[1879.44 → 1886.24] until I was streaming today and you guys wouldn't stop talking about how apparently horrible his build was
[1886.24 → 1892.00] so given that I did offer to help I will with no guilt you go what's the critiquing I don't select
[1892.00 → 1900.64] QC's pc build I've never done a reaction video before so wish me luck just like I feel lucky to
[1900.64 → 1905.76] tell you about our sponsor rich wallet cool it wants to redefine the wallet with its compact frame and RF
[1905.76 → 1910.08] ID blocking plates check out how they can keep your wallet bulge down and use offer code Linus
[1910.08 → 1914.24] hold on let me just fix the volume remember the volume earlier does he not explain it because
[1914.24 → 1920.32] I've actually been wondering about that why is your face everywhere uh so no, no there, there worldwide
[1920.32 → 1926.00] shipping there is an explanation for that uh my face is everywhere because there's like an emote
[1926.00 → 1931.76] on his stream I think it's okay champ or something like that or there's something that you can do to
[1931.76 → 1940.24] make my face appear on his stuff okay all right is that my face that is my face why is my
[1940.24 → 1946.40] face on his stream okay first things first um yeah I want to unbox everything but first things first I'm
[1946.40 → 1951.28] going to set myself up on the carpet now we did show recently in our collab with electro boom that the risk
[1951.28 → 1958.16] of actually damaging your components with electrostatic I don't know if I'm at the same time stamp you are
[1958.16 → 1965.92] on a low pile carpet and unbox computer hardware, so motherboard goes first I got a rogue cross air
[1966.48 → 1972.96] v iii formula dude why not get you this is a very overpaid computer okay some of these parts were
[1972.96 → 1976.80] really way more expensive than they should have been, but it's covid and whatnot so it is what it is man
[1976.80 → 1981.68] is he actually going to water cool because that motherboard has like integrated chipset water cooling
[1981.68 → 1986.56] first we'll open the actual CPU itself what I don't know what I don't know what he just said okay
[1988.16 → 1993.44] unfortunately I also misspoke there because i what I meant was arm water cooling but I was kind of
[1993.44 → 2001.92] like mind blown seven hundred dollars oh, but there's no there's no real alternative this is the piece
[2001.92 → 2007.76] that is worth all the money oh man little metal rack it up oh my god this must be how people feel
[2007.76 → 2013.52] watching me handle stuff like seemingly not carefully I assure you guys I know what I'm doing but I'm not
[2013.52 → 2019.68] actually convinced that Felix knows what he's doing oh I don't get oh that got it you gotta
[2019.68 → 2025.44] pull out from the thing okay, okay put the arm the other way also what's important here the most
[2025.44 → 2031.76] important part of all this is the bragging rights so whenever you build all those stickers whenever you buy
[2031.76 → 2038.00] these boxes okay he's joking about this but I actually have like a whole sticker book with like a shiny kitty
[2038.00 → 2046.00] on the front of like old case badges from yeah way back like 10 15 years ago oh man you know what i
[2046.00 → 2053.44] think I have that at home I wonder if I could find it to show you guys your sticker book yeah have you
[2053.44 → 2058.96] seen it do you know what I'm talking about it's got like it's got a blue cover on it, and then it's got
[2058.96 → 2063.84] like it's its like sparkly because i think you showed it to me after you saw all the
[2063.84 → 2068.24] stickers that were on my original mineral oil cool computer because I had the whole row of case
[2068.24 → 2073.92] badges yeah yeah and I think you showed me you know okay, okay I showed you mine you show
[2073.92 → 2079.04] me yours that's how it works yeah yeah yeah okay oh man I'm kind of tempted to just let this run and
[2079.04 → 2085.12] go look for it but then I'm not reacting to his reaction to my reaction so I can react to it okay
[2085.68 → 2090.32] okay Luke's going to react for a little bit I'm gonna I'm going to let it I'm going to let it ride and I'm
[2090.32 → 2095.60] going to run upstairs I'm going to see if I can find my sticker book okay all right uh this seems worth it
[2095.60 → 2099.92] to me where's that uh where's that link here we go all right I'm putting I'm putting it back
[2099.92 → 2108.88] up here 128 gigs of ram okay but I don't know where you're at hold on I'm at him opening up the I'm at
[2108.88 → 2116.56] him uh opening up the 128 gigs of ram so what's the exact time 201 16 okay yeah I'm going ahead of you
[2116.56 → 2126.24] 201 24 20 124. Wait for a sec okay I can't, I can't scrub that carefully it doesn't it doesn't
[2126.24 → 2131.36] not that granular I'm so uh man if you go like if you go like a little bit ahead that's probably
[2131.36 → 2139.12] fine anyway I mean I need 10 seconds all right we're good okay go for it um oh man I want my
[2139.12 → 2145.36] four seconds all right I'm pressing play I'm pressing play now yep yep go he's now used to
[2145.36 → 2151.60] read juicers twice he's got a hundred I love the term juicers by the way I had an I had an uh I had an
[2151.60 → 2156.96] absolute boomer moment with juicers because I've been trying to I've been trying to get into chess for
[2156.96 → 2161.52] like a year but I've been watching a bunch of chess content and uh one of the guys that I was watching
[2161.52 → 2168.24] kept saying juicers I was like what the heck I was trying to look up on chess websites like what juicer
[2168.24 → 2173.44] means and stuff yeah if this single big boomer moment gaming and streaming setup doesn't work
[2173.44 → 2180.24] then you can take 64 gigs of this 128 yes a lot for a gaming and streaming machine and put it into
[2180.24 → 2184.16] a separate machine okay, okay let me do a little bit explaining voice I know so you guys already know
[2184.16 → 2190.00] this okay, and you're like a tech genius, so this is um I don't know why this movie doesn't have it
[2190.00 → 2195.28] but normally you're going to have two colours right these are your channels sometimes something called dual
[2195.28 → 2202.32] channel i think or something like that okay that's very close the memory slots are colour coded so
[2202.32 → 2206.96] you will correctly install your dual channel memory, but they're not colour coded according to the
[2206.96 → 2211.60] channels it's actually the other way around their colour coded so that your monkey brain will put
[2211.60 → 2218.48] two sticks in the same colours and get dual channel operation, but it's actually the two separate
[2218.48 → 2225.76] channels that are the same colour dual channel now you know open the bracket at the back one two three
[2228.72 → 2230.48] the ram inside the computer
[2236.64 → 2237.52] that was awesome
[2237.52 → 2241.76] that's awesome
[2241.76 → 2248.08] now on the one hand he says I usually okay and that's not even wrong
[2250.48 → 2255.20] I love yeah the combination of lettuce being like so your monkey brain does the right thing
[2255.20 → 2263.60] and then
[2266.56 → 2267.12] oh that's great
[2267.12 → 2274.56] break I'm going to lose it why is my face keep showing up is this like a twitch feature stick number two
[2275.12 → 2280.96] twitch chat's already like call Linus it's backwards again yeah why not he should have just done that
[2280.96 → 2287.36] dude okay loose volumes going from super loud to not to that it's probably just how I'm talking to be
[2287.36 → 2287.92] completely honest
[2289.04 → 2294.32] uh we don't have to have these uh see this is like the old SSDs which are it being been nine minutes and
[2294.32 → 2296.00] he has installed the CPU in memory
[2298.72 → 2303.84] oh very dog those are a little bit better they're really faster they're little of a hassle to put in
[2303.84 → 2310.24] this is true and thankfully boys we got two of them he is in for a real nightmare if he wants to
[2310.24 → 2318.16] configure NVMe raid on well really any platform but I don't know yeah yeah I didn't suspect that
[2318.16 → 2322.72] was going to matter I didn't think he's going to bother he said he doesn't know what it is like yeah I don't
[2322.72 → 2327.28] think that's the point rocket lineup up to eight terabytes um I think that the m2 drives are hidden
[2327.28 → 2333.04] under here after the bolt can I just say for a moment that I love the Quebec de bolt enlisting
[2333.04 → 2341.68] deadbolt it yeah same thing it's gonna deadbolt like attachments' transformer looking things like that
[2341.68 → 2346.64] oh it's just a strip I've seen more strong I appreciate you AJ
[2347.20 → 2352.32] bolts or whatever stand up you can deadbolt things anytime you want to set it up are those SpongeBob
[2352.32 → 2357.76] socks because I definitely approve that really is not all the way in good thing twitch chat is babysitting
[2357.76 → 2364.16] oh he's no it's still not in is it not in okay I'm stupid overall I've seen I've seen far worse
[2364.16 → 2369.12] I've seen far worse not for the second one wait is he going to screw it in I mean he hasn't he hasn't
[2369.12 → 2381.28] like ruined anything so yeah the x backplate what guys the x backplate x backplate before the
[2381.28 → 2384.48] motherboard oh the back is open no
[2387.60 → 2392.08] the bill I got the crack in seven three guys I thought back in the days you had to put like
[2392.08 → 2396.56] like a weird thing at the back yeah I figured out what he's talking about with x backplate I figured
[2396.56 → 2403.68] that out from down to up is he really trying to justify that I would buy a computer based on
[2403.68 → 2409.68] twitch chat's recommendations is he really trying to justify this people say it's bad just but no
[2409.68 → 2413.84] not really he's mostly just like kind of laughing and inserting like oh this is why I thought that
[2413.84 → 2420.64] except that he's chill I'm lazy actually it's just because I'm lazy it's been funny so far you know when
[2420.64 → 2426.00] you uh you explain the like colour coding for dual channel and whatnot his reaction to that after you
[2426.00 → 2430.24] said like it's done this way, so your monkey brain does it right his reaction after that there was
[2430.24 → 2438.56] like a decent pause, and he's just like huh that was perfect I appreciated that a lot
[2440.08 → 2444.72] call him I don't I don't Linus has his number no I don't have his number pretty much but
[2445.84 → 2449.68] now I'm just really not so he's too much of a celebrity for you Linus yeah I know right
[2449.68 → 2461.04] oh man this part was so painful to watch he's got to be he's got to be just pretending like I think you
[2461.04 → 2466.40] guys are just suckers I'm sure I always pretend for content guys just fine guys if the rule of case
[2468.88 → 2475.36] so he 100 knew that he can put the radiator in the front he just didn't want to remove 12 screws
[2475.36 → 2482.64] I'm going to read but the message I sent him it's possible we could get you hooked up with a system
[2482.64 → 2487.36] and we'd love to collab, but surely you got at least half a dozen system integrators on speed dial who
[2487.36 → 2492.40] could get you anything you want okay if you're not in a hurry the thing is like patient's another
[2492.40 → 2496.40] position to tackle anything big like the paper pc we built for pews at the moment okay like there's
[2496.40 → 2501.68] a hurry it may be faster I'm kind of like just getting hooked up with a pc builder just let me know
[2501.68 → 2505.28] the camera email's best for me since this is a shared inbox with much other stuff here
[2505.28 → 2510.80] intending for it to be in the video if you aren't willing to remove 12 screws that I go through
[2510.80 → 2518.00] well guys it's not about the screws jack is that in the pc okay if it's is it's like if the
[2518.88 → 2524.56] fans come with the case okay you know I don't know anything about you have to d um you have to cut
[2524.56 → 2530.00] the wire holders and then and all the wires go loose hold on hold on there's some
[2530.00 → 2535.84] volume problem hold on wait there's a volume problem it's going to be terrible
[2535.84 → 2540.24] to remove them I just said that no it's going to be 12 screws through minus wait I can't do anything
[2540.24 → 2547.68] you run into these situations where it seems pretty obvious what's up there's a crazy audio problem
[2547.68 → 2552.72] I think we need to do oh hold on a second well let me pause this thing uh what's the crazy
[2552.72 → 2560.32] audio problem I'm not 100 certain oh apparently I'm super loud oh okay uh is it fixed now or not i
[2560.32 → 2566.24] have no idea I think were you watching your own stream somewhere or something uh no, no should be
[2566.24 → 2575.76] okay should be fine now we good I don't know let me try to tune in yes it's fine yep sorry about that
[2575.76 → 2580.80] uh so my bad guys uh but basically so what I was saying was there was this whole there's this whole
[2580.80 → 2589.76] process where I like I thought he was just like playing a character and then over time because he
[2589.76 → 2597.52] would he would explain really clearly he'd be like oh I don't I don't know you know anything about
[2597.52 → 2602.88] computers, but then he would explain really clearly you know what the role of that part is or like
[2602.88 → 2608.32] how to install it and I'd be like no you know about computers, but then he'd encounter something
[2608.32 → 2615.04] where what I think I'm what I think I figured out was that he knows a lot but only about the things
[2615.04 → 2621.52] where he's like had the time to do the research and so it started out with I think a little bit of
[2621.52 → 2628.88] playing a character and over time became okay the character that he might have been playing a little bit
[2628.88 → 2636.88] there is actually him okay fair enough all right let me turn this let me turn the stream back on here
[2637.84 → 2644.24] guys they're welded to the mesh dude oh my god no they're apparently the stream was very loud that
[2644.24 → 2651.20] was the problem i I got it I got it bolt this in at the top the speed with which he switches between
[2651.20 → 2656.96] eureka moments and having no idea what's going on again okay well this is really tough
[2656.96 → 2664.64] little chat this is literally soldered together no and re-screw our thing manually at the top so we
[2664.64 → 2670.88] can put the CPU oh I don't think you're showing the video oh sorry, sorry guys there you go push or
[2672.00 → 2678.08] again he's demonstrating fairly deep knowledge he knows that we're going to have full fans at the front
[2678.08 → 2683.92] and we're going to have the best the reason why i sort of know in depth of a knot because one of my brother
[2683.92 → 2690.16] would build pcs he would tell me about it but I would only remember certain parts he said yo dude a
[2690.16 → 2698.00] computer uh airflow push-pull push-pull it's going to push suck fresh air and push hot air out
[2698.88 → 2703.20] balanced airflow, but then he thinks his case is welded together I don't wait a minute
[2703.20 → 2726.00] what is going on wait a minute wait that makes sense dude
[2726.00 → 2733.52] dude i just debut them leave them there no but even if you put the radiator on the GPU still
[2733.52 → 2738.80] wouldn't fit though beginners build like really for beginners we need to bring in a committee of
[2738.80 → 2745.12] qualified beginners to ask their questions as we go and make sure that we answer every single one of
[2745.12 → 2752.00] them dude there's not enough space for three of them why is he trying to put three fans there is
[2752.00 → 2757.60] he fakes it because he came with three of them it doesn't go like this no but uh no dude you can't
[2757.60 → 2761.20] it doesn't matter if it came with three of them it didn't it's not designed for that spot
[2761.20 → 2771.68] I spun this thing see the both ways oh the most painful part of this was how many times I saw him
[2771.68 → 2781.28] put it in there properly like he'd be like oh I have it lined up and I'd be like yes you do please stop
[2781.28 → 2791.20] moving it now like you're good you're good, but you know i think a significant I think 80
[2791.20 → 2798.00] of the problem though is his chat so I tuned into one of his streams uh yesterday where he was like
[2798.00 → 2808.48] gambling in a GTA 5 casino or something like that and his chat is just it moves at such a rate and with
[2808.48 → 2817.60] such a diverse many minds of its own that to have it to have it even remote be even remotely
[2817.60 → 2824.16] helpful would have to be an accident like it's if is he managed to build a pc with help from his chat
[2824.16 → 2828.24] it would take as long as it took like twitch plays Pokémon to beat the game like it just
[2829.84 → 2835.20] that's the level that we're dealing with here um, so people would tell him when he had it right and
[2835.20 → 2841.20] they would give him the right information when he had it wrong but mixed into that information with
[2841.20 → 2847.44] so many people giving the wrong information that it's just you couldn't hear the signal over the noise
[2848.16 → 2855.92] yeah yeah he absolutely I mean okay it would have been worse without chat probably but I still think
[2855.92 → 2862.32] that chat because there was so much uh incorrect information and because the timing is often a little
[2862.32 → 2867.92] bit off so sometimes he'd be like repositioning something really fast, and they'd be like yeah
[2867.92 → 2873.68] that's right and then because of the five or ten-second time delay it's really easy to make a
[2873.68 → 2880.48] mistake based on that leg right yeah definitely all right let me let me put this let me put this
[2880.48 → 2888.64] back on let me put this mess back what time is that now uh I'm at uh 2 10 24. The radiator should
[2888.64 → 2899.12] fit in here yes it does all right we got the radiator in okay why would you have the tubes down
[2899.12 → 2906.40] aren't they gonna work against gravity dude fun fact in a closed loop gravity kind of is like
[2906.40 → 2912.24] cancelled out you could think of it that way because gravity might pull some of the water down but then
[2912.24 → 2918.00] that equal force will push the other water like up like it's wait a minute I think his mind just
[2918.00 → 2923.52] yeah but wouldn't you want gravity to be doing that process and on top of the pumping instead of
[2923.52 → 2931.60] doing that motion through mechanical pumping oh no oh none of that meant anything oh no okay all right
[2931.60 → 2939.44] okay let me take another crack at this one okay so um okay so let's let's say hypothetically okay you've
[2939.44 → 2945.60] got your pump you got your pump here okay in the bottom of the thing um okay you know what no we're
[2945.60 → 2950.72] going we're going MS Paint we're going MS Paint ladies and gentlemen we're doing it perfectly okay
[2950.72 → 2956.88] I got some MS Paint up in here display capture okay here we go so I'm a draw I'm a draw for you all
[2956.88 → 2965.84] so we got uh we got a loop okay we got our CPU block okay, so there's our CPU okay, and we got our tubes
[2965.84 → 2973.76] so here's a tube you got your radiator there are some fans they're pushing they're pulling okay and
[2973.76 → 2978.08] then you got your other thing you got your you got your pump here okay
[2981.04 → 2984.80] pump okay you got your res so you know you got your
[2984.80 → 2991.52] you got your res right here okay res
[2994.00 → 3001.12] resurrection all right so then you got your other more different tube going up to here okay, so there's
[3001.12 → 3010.56] your thing so theoretically okay all this like water okay it's got the gravity it's got the gravity on it
[3010.56 → 3016.80] right okay, so the stream's super delayed so I'm just seeing this now but like oh my
[3019.92 → 3025.12] that's that's that's even pretty bad for like for you and paint like that this is the next level of
[3025.12 → 3030.24] low Luke can you just chill for a second okay we have descended further into the Diablo one castle
[3030.24 → 3034.32] so here we're we got I'm getting a different colour I'm bringing some production values okay
[3034.32 → 3042.56] nice okay so we got though here's some water no, no shoot hold on I screwed that up uh oh wait no, no
[3042.56 → 3047.28] it's fine it's fine I can fix this I just need the paint bucket and some blue one
[3050.48 → 3056.80] I don't want to redraw the arrows it's too hard okay, okay, so there's your water we got some gravity water
[3056.80 → 3062.24] okay and then this water oh no gravity water okay hold on a second I need some gravity waves what colour
[3062.24 → 3068.24] are gravity waves they're brown okay so here's gravity waves on the water they're
[3068.24 → 3074.56] going down okay gravity waves okay, okay so then we got some more we got some more water in
[3074.56 → 3081.04] here let me just um we're doing a little science lesson we've got some water okay all right so I think
[3081.04 → 3088.16] we can all agree right now that the gravity waves on this water are neutral neutralized right because
[3088.16 → 3095.04] this water is going neither uphill nor downhill okay we good Luke i I won't be able to see it for
[3095.04 → 3101.12] a little bit I'm going to say yes the one going across okay oh cool yeah sure yeah all right cool so that
[3101.12 → 3105.92] that's the gravity waves they're cancelled out okay uh I think I can actually screen share with you
[3105.92 → 3112.64] through discord so let's just do that okay nice there we go we good we good okay yes I'm up to
[3112.64 → 3119.20] today now gorgeous uh hold on a second I think I just screwed that up by uh minimizing the discord
[3119.84 → 3128.00] thing uh okay yeah sure it should be fine okay so we good we got gravity waves right here yeah okay uh so
[3128.00 → 3135.68] then we've got the gravity waves that are pulling this water down the hill right here yes okay good
[3135.68 → 3140.96] but then we got the gravity waves that are pulling this water that's trying to go up down impossible that
[3140.96 → 3145.76] water will never make it because there's gravity it'll never make it because of the gravity okay yeah
[3145.76 → 3152.80] okay but here's the mind-blowing thing and this is what I think Felix uh is maybe not aware of
[3152.80 → 3161.52] is that water is basic for all intents and purposes non-compressible okay so what happens is that as the
[3161.52 → 3167.36] gravity pulls down this water here we're going to get some more arrows in here I need just like a thicker thing
[3167.36 → 3175.44] as the gravity pulls down this water okay that water comes into the pump into the reservoir okay so it
[3175.44 → 3183.12] gets into the reservoir, and then it rises again that's why we call it the resurrection reservoir okay
[3183.12 → 3191.04] so it goes down and then rises again because this gravity force down here it actually enacts
[3191.04 → 3199.12] uh like an equal force pushing this water up so within a closed system gravity because the pump
[3199.12 → 3204.72] there i I think not really it would just be pressure from the pump no, no I'm talking I'm only talking
[3204.72 → 3210.64] about the impact from the brown waves Luke only the brown waves we're ignoring the pump okay because he's
[3210.64 → 3216.16] saying gravity is affecting it so I'm just demonstrating why gravity would not affect it without
[3216.16 → 3222.08] friction okay if you started this water moving it's a perpetual motion machine it would go forever
[3222.08 → 3228.56] because gravity would not stop it because the force that gravity exerts pulling the water down equally
[3228.56 → 3235.60] affects pushing the water back up that's the point I'm trying to make okay so basically the only way
[3235.60 → 3244.80] that gravity can affect a loop okay is right here if this line is too long okay this line goes like this
[3244.80 → 3252.56] do do do do or not too long it goes up too high okay and the water never actually reaches
[3252.56 → 3257.76] this point right here where the gravity starts to cancel out, and it goes down the hill and back
[3258.72 → 3266.48] so that is where the specification for pumps uh where that's where the head pressure starts to matter okay
[3267.68 → 3274.48] in the event that you had a situation where the pump had to push water up a long way like let's say for
[3274.48 → 3282.40] example that I wanted to dig up my backyard bury a bunch of copper tubing and do like a geothermal
[3282.96 → 3289.20] cooling solution for my server room totally hypothetical haven't had Colin look into this at all
[3290.32 → 3296.72] what I would need is down at the bottom like at the ground level of my house is I would need a pump
[3296.72 → 3303.84] that has sufficient head pressure to push the water up to the second story of my house in the first
[3303.84 → 3311.28] place okay once it's up there once the water's moving if in some way I was able to prime that system
[3311.28 → 3317.84] and fill it with water it would not be an issue so once the water starts to fall to cancel it out we good
[3318.40 → 3324.56] but you do have to have sufficient pressure to get the water over the hump in the first place so that's
[3324.56 → 3332.48] what I was trying to explain and that's what this diagram I think very clearly demonstrates okay is
[3332.48 → 3339.84] that all crystal it's essentially a perfect diagram yeah i also uh I just have a question of when
[3339.84 → 3348.48] that diagram on a shirt will be available on the Ltd store I'm thinking probably never that's maybe a
[3348.48 → 3355.04] good thing um yeah i I hope maybe that'll make more sense, but yeah pressure is essentially the answer
[3355.04 → 3362.80] to all of it all right okay cool so let's go ahead uh oh wait people couldn't uh people couldn't see the
[3362.80 → 3368.32] diagram couldn't you guys see the diagram I'm pretty sure I showed it maybe not near the end I was
[3368.32 → 3372.56] definitely able to see it on the stream before you started sharing on discord all right cool
[3372.56 → 3376.40] well sorry about that guys sorry we're doing we're doing our best here we're doing our best here all
[3376.40 → 3383.36] right so let's go back to let's go back to the stream here book I need more monitors somebody said
[3383.36 → 3390.56] tubes down won't fit with the GPU longer lifespan of the product so you're at like 11 20. Actually don't
[3390.56 → 3397.12] know if that's gonna reach is 11 25. yeah, 11 20 right now optimal cool the pump to last longer but it
[3397.12 → 3403.76] actually just might not reach oh, and then you install the thing on the bracket and then you
[3403.76 → 3411.12] bracket it in that was such a beautiful moment I was so happy wire it's not the same size dude
[3411.76 → 3418.00] no, no it's fine you got the other holes it's okay it doesn't fit dude it does it's fine well
[3418.00 → 3421.84] we're going to be using those then we have to use those then people are going to tell him to flip it
[3421.84 → 3427.44] around right apparently I'm still loud by the way uh I know, so the problem is his stream is super quiet
[3428.08 → 3433.44] uh okay you know what I can adjust you no way hold on give me a second this one no, no it doesn't go on
[3433.44 → 3439.36] that side of the now how do we do it what wait is he going to put one corsair okay we should be good
[3439.36 → 3446.80] like other next dude the fans are on the wrong side man guys the wires on the other side fans can go
[3446.80 → 3452.00] on any side of the radiator you want it doesn't matter if they're on this side then they blow and
[3452.00 → 3459.36] if they're on this side then they suck it's the wire goes inside the computer this goes on the outside
[3459.36 → 3466.72] good this is going to hang the whole thing together yes fans then need to go inside the bracket it doesn't
[3466.72 → 3474.24] matter so like this then that's fine the bracket goes at the back and then the bracket goes inside at the
[3474.24 → 3482.72] back logo outside yes okay I had it right the whole time dude i literally from the start I don't know if
[3482.72 → 3489.20] you had it right the whole time but yes fundamentally what you're saying is sound so the logo the sticker of the
[3489.20 → 3498.08] the oh man okay that okay he gets so happy when I'm like yeah you did this one little thing right
[3499.04 → 3504.96] wait over the radiator you also I will say you also seem genuinely proud of him when he does do something
[3504.96 → 3510.48] correctly it is completely installed okay it feels like you just fine you're you're I mean the stern and
[3510.48 → 3516.32] honest but on his team which is cool i I was on his team I want to look from the very beginning I wanted
[3516.32 → 3522.64] him to succeed man no he does have the tubes at the top so yes the fans are sticking right up next to
[3522.64 → 3528.32] the window okay I mean that's not going to affect the functionality of the machine wrong strip gaming
[3528.32 → 3539.20] graphics card GeForce RTX 3090 NVIDIA Asus or OC o clock 2.40 GPU juicer there it is I don't think that's
[3539.20 → 3544.72] going to fit okay that thing that's an enormous card if it wasn't covid I would just fly out there and
[3544.72 → 3552.00] build it for him, I can't screw if it's actually not lined up this was so painful man you just gotta
[3552.56 → 3557.20] you just gotta kind of you know it's weird because he's saying like it's not lined up, but he's showing
[3557.60 → 3563.20] I can see how that would be really confusing for people I have seen so much worse than that like
[3563.20 → 3572.40] and even then even the GPU slot doesn't line up dude unless you're meant to use the squares part
[3572.40 → 3580.00] but I don't think so no please don't do that no that's not you just don't get there dude look at the
[3582.40 → 3589.28] meanwhile he's showing that like you can totally see yeah you can see daylight through them Luke yeah
[3589.28 → 3593.52] Luke that's my whole confusion like me, it's a camera angle thing I don't know, but it looks
[3593.52 → 3598.56] completely fine to me, I don't understand the problem BCI backplates sometimes don't quite
[3598.56 → 3604.56] have the mounting holes he wants to say something I figured out was a problem if id e-bolted
[3604.56 → 3610.64] the motherboard a little bit a tiny bit and I loosened it and I pushed the whole motherboard
[3610.64 → 3618.40] to the side and then re-bolted it is would have given me a bigger uh a play zone to get the screws
[3618.40 → 3624.08] and that can be extremely frustrating especially I love his wording for things a bigger play zone
[3624.08 → 3630.32] yes okay yes what he's talking about is the differences in manufacturing tolerances uh from
[3630.32 → 3635.68] one case to another so as long as you kind of like you have a little bit of wiggle room it can help
[3637.68 → 3642.32] i I'm actually just like kind of doing what you need to do you have to have you have to put some force on
[3642.32 → 3648.16] it sometimes you have to understand the kinds of costs that pc case manufacturers are targeting it's just
[3648.64 → 3653.28] it kind of comes with the territory okay I'm gonna re-box some other stuff I can't chat with it in your
[3653.28 → 3660.08] case there you go corsair honest consumer review your case a disaster the good news is I don't think
[3660.08 → 3665.04] any of this stuff is broken okay now I feel worse because at the beginning it was pretty clear that he
[3665.04 → 3670.00] was just pretty much knew what he was doing but was kind of like playing a character then by the end
[3670.00 → 3677.52] it's obvious that he was ready to Huck the GPU at the wall uh so Felix if you're watching this my offer
[3677.52 → 3683.76] still stands I dm'd you I would be happy to walk you through this we can make that case work you can
[3683.76 → 3689.36] you can destroy that case get rid of it do whatever you need to do donate it get a different one but um
[3689.36 → 3695.76] just let me know no because uh I'm I'm here for you my, so the case was a disaster does he agree
[3696.56 → 3700.32] does he agree that the case is a disaster no I don't agree the case is a disaster
[3700.32 → 3701.28] I told you agreed right
[3703.68 → 3705.60] no
[3705.84 → 3709.28] just like I'm here for my audience to tell them about fresh books
[3709.28 → 3712.24] fresh books is the easy hey look at him learning about fresh books
[3712.24 → 3718.96] I do I will say this business owner yeah there seems to be at least a bit of honour
[3719.52 → 3723.44] with the twitch people that will hold on what would be the best case for that current build
[3724.40 → 3728.08] I have I thought the fractal was pretty good, and it's got built in
[3728.08 → 3734.00] he's talking about the case he's not learning about fresh books okay go ahead Luke the most of
[3734.00 → 3740.48] people on twitch that I've seen watch YouTube videos will watch the ads every time really yeah oh
[3740.48 → 3746.00] interesting okay that's like actually kind of cool okay got it got it okay here I think
[3746.00 → 3752.40] yeah like he watched your he watched the ridge wallet at the beginning, and he was like oh cool
[3752.40 → 3757.12] like they also like don't like trash it and stuff no that's cool that's cool I see I don't know that
[3757.12 → 3761.52] much about twitch culture like yeah I'm streaming on twitch right now or whatever but like that
[3761.52 → 3766.96] doesn't mean I actually have any idea what their deal is over there it's uh I'm learning
[3766.96 → 3771.84] I'm learning though I'm learning we keep hiring boomers so I keep learning more stuff uh we i
[3771.84 → 3779.92] got I got a hr complaint Luke um i I received a hr complaint from uh some of our editors that one of
[3779.92 → 3785.92] our new editors who's not off probation yet so we uh we're not giving her name yet but one of our new
[3785.92 → 3793.92] editors and then Nicole okay ganged up on a couple of our older editors and called them boomers because
[3793.92 → 3799.36] they had never heard of QC and kept accidentally referring to them as xkcd
[3803.60 → 3808.40] sounds like they're boomers to me, it kind of does sound like they're boomers to me if you don't know
[3808.40 → 3814.24] if you don't know QC, but you know xkcd you might be a boomer that's that's all I have to say about it
[3814.24 → 3819.28] okay so hold on let's hear let's hear is let's hear Felix's uh wrap up here whether you're a trade
[3819.28 → 3824.16] person creative agency or YouTuber they've got a plan that's right for you and if you're having
[3824.16 → 3830.24] trouble their award-winning Toronto-based support team is always happy nice so don't wait try fresh
[3830.24 → 3836.88] books for free for 30 days today no credit card required at freshbooks.com Linus normally at the
[3836.88 → 3841.28] end of our videos we throw to another similar video we've made that you can go enjoy but since we
[3841.28 → 3846.48] fractal yes bite we can match oh okay because you have one makes what I have right now like this
[3846.48 → 3850.24] before why don't you go watch Linus reed's mean comments they're me
[3853.12 → 3858.40] I'm not really the kind well that was very nice okay because he didn't roast me too hard
[3858.40 → 3860.88] guys he didn't roast me too hard by the way chat
[3863.04 → 3864.16] because I was guys
[3867.28 → 3868.24] it's just um
[3871.28 → 3874.16] I can't tell if he's upset or not
[3874.16 → 3875.84] first you need a table
[3875.84 → 3883.36] oh he switches all right oh man how hard can it be if Linus can do it, it's your fault
[3883.36 → 3888.32] unless you made it look easy true oh come on now that's not that's not fair
[3890.48 → 3896.48] guys I'm not subscribed guys this yeah this is my business account boys this is a business
[3896.48 → 3904.56] account I got the business account oh I'm sorry i i I didn't mean to i didn't mean to I just thought
[3904.56 → 3910.48] me I don't know why oh he was so close to disliking the videos for this dude I'm not I never like or
[3910.48 → 3911.36] dislike videos
[3911.36 → 3922.80] I'm sorry chat I didn't know it is my friend bento guy's birthday can I get a happy birthday Ben okay
[3923.44 → 3930.56] excuse me now hold on a second guy I don't know how to explain it okay and even if I did it you would
[3930.56 → 3936.16] still question mark me okay I don't know what it is about communicating with other people
[3936.16 → 3944.80] I checked smile smile i just I'm just not the best communicator like uh
[3945.44 → 3948.08] five months somebody will show interest, or they want to help whatever
[3948.08 → 3951.84] well and all of a sudden one dm and then yeah so he wasn't saying that you're like
[3953.60 → 3959.28] or he can't reply to you yeah yeah oh I was mostly just teasing because the okay
[3959.28 → 3965.20] was it not clear that I was just teasing earlier because i I tell people exactly the same thing i
[3965.20 → 3972.88] apologize I'm just like look I'm so sorry the reality of it is that I am I get a lot of emails and i
[3972.88 → 3980.56] mean you've probably seen me pull this at trade shows I actually hate oh yeah I get like the worst
[3980.56 → 3985.28] anxiety about it and the reason is not because I don't love learning about new tech I mean Luke you
[3985.28 → 3991.68] go through the same thing quite honestly you've been here uh, and it's not it's not personal it's just
[3991.68 → 3998.96] that I get this terrible anxiety at trade shows because no offence to anyone else and I'm not trying
[3998.96 → 4004.56] to make this like an ego thing or anything like that like just like Felix I think it's really easy
[4004.56 → 4010.56] for me to talk about this and have it come across totally the wrong way but the reality of it is when
[4010.56 → 4017.60] I go to a trade show I meet every single time I meet somewhere in the neighbourhood of probably 200
[4017.60 → 4024.16] to 400 people will introduce themselves to me and that's ignoring the extras at like parties like I'll go
[4024.16 → 4028.72] into a booth there will be a bunch of people that I've never interacted with before from like
[4028.96 → 4035.36] the European or Asian offices of some company they'll all introduce themselves to me and say
[4035.36 → 4039.92] their names and then I'll go and I'll do the same thing 45 minutes later with some other company I'll
[4039.92 → 4047.68] do the same thing 45 minutes later I'm running on basically no sleep not enough food like so what
[4047.68 → 4053.68] happens is you do this enough times like I can't remember it I'm not retaining it because when my brain's
[4053.68 → 4058.72] in trade show mode it's in like okay I need to remember absolutely everything there is to know
[4058.72 → 4064.64] about this product so I can talk about it for four minutes without having to consult a piece of paper
[4064.64 → 4071.44] or notes you're like pumping dumping memory yeah exactly I remember, and you taught me kind of how to do
[4071.44 → 4077.92] this way back I don't know if you ever remember but um you'll remember almost nothing about a product like
[4077.92 → 4082.96] like five minutes after you leave the booth, and it's just it has to be that way or else you won't
[4082.96 → 4088.64] be able to do the next video exactly you have to like be exchanging that memory as fast as you can and
[4088.64 → 4095.20] you get into this mode you get into this groove and so what happens is unfortunately because I've been
[4095.20 → 4101.84] going to trade shows for over 10 years there will be people that I have met under these circumstances
[4101.84 → 4108.72] like I'm going to trade shows literally five or six or seven times and I will walk up and I'll be
[4108.72 → 4116.40] like hi Linus nice to meet you, and they'll be like yeah we go through this every year I feel so bad
[4117.20 → 4121.92] you have to stop saying nice to meet you i that that was one of my tricks yeah I don't say nice to
[4121.92 → 4126.56] meet you anymore I would always try and get it right because I know I'm not going to remember the name
[4126.56 → 4132.56] so I will try to at least get right whether I'm supposed to know who they are or not but then
[4132.56 → 4142.16] sometimes I'd sometimes I'd, I'd go for it is'd be a clear miss you know and uh you know I just learned
[4142.16 → 4146.88] to I just learned to accept that there was this really nice guy who worked at adtech when i first
[4146.88 → 4155.44] met him and who I think moved to I want to say razor, and it was like oh man it was like four or five
[4155.44 → 4162.64] times I did this to him, he was like yep I like flew out to the NCI headquarters I briefed you on
[4162.64 → 4167.92] this case we had a one-on-one briefing for over an hour and this time i really just didn't have
[4167.92 → 4173.28] any excuse because like, but the thing is I was focused on the case like that's how I am I'm like
[4173.28 → 4180.08] I'm all about the product I'm all about the tech I'm not Luca I'm gonna I'm going to confess
[4180.08 → 4183.92] something I'm going to confess something on stream I'm not much of a people person
[4183.92 → 4191.28] you know i I got into the know this you know this I got into this line of work because
[4191.28 → 4196.56] I'm not a people person the people happen by accident I didn't ask for anyone to follow me
[4198.56 → 4205.20] you know i just i got tapped I got tapped on the shoulder to make the tech channel because i
[4205.76 → 4211.76] cared more about memory timings than going out on you know with my friends because I didn't have any you
[4211.76 → 4218.32] know what I'm saying i just yeah oh yeah I was kind of in the same spot you're the one that kind
[4218.32 → 4226.48] of pushed me to go on camera originally oh man i just uh, so anyway the point is I am basically exactly
[4226.48 → 4231.76] the same I'm always apologizing to people for forgetting their names for not replying to their
[4231.76 → 4239.28] emails because i just I have no I have no brain space for that like my inbox I leave things marked
[4239.28 → 4246.08] on red because there is otherwise absolutely no chance in hell that I will ever remember to look
[4246.08 → 4251.92] at it again I mean even things like um you know remembering important events for my wife or something
[4251.92 → 4259.84] like that like I have a doc of like ideas for special occasions and stuff like that and i I have
[4259.84 → 4265.44] like calendar events like hey Valentine's Day is coming up there's this one time when we just started
[4265.44 → 4271.20] going out that um I pulled like the biggest bonehead move I think I've talked to you about it on the
[4271.20 → 4277.68] wan show before so I'm not going to go real deep into it but pretty much i we were at school and I like
[4277.68 → 4283.60] invited her to come over after school which was no small feat because we went to school at UBC which
[4283.60 → 4289.84] is at the very, very west end of the Vancouver area and I lived in maple ridge which is by train which
[4289.84 → 4295.44] is how we were going about three and a half hours so we're done class at like you know early afternoon
[4295.44 → 4301.28] mid-afternoon we're only going to get a couple of hours together before I have to drive her home one small
[4301.28 → 4305.92] problem so she was basically giving up her whole evening to spend it on the train just to kind of hang
[4305.92 → 4311.52] with me for a little bit the problem is she thought I had something special planned because it was her birthday
[4316.40 → 4321.36] so she thought I remember this, but it's been a while she had plans with her family that evening
[4322.00 → 4329.68] that she bailed on because she thought her boyfriend had something really special that he was going to do
[4329.68 → 4337.84] for her birthday, and it wasn't until we reached the train station okay the west coast express
[4337.84 → 4343.44] it wasn't until we reached the train station, and it's not that I don't know her birthday I know her
[4343.44 → 4350.32] birthday i just I'm a bit of an I'm a bit of a scatterbrain you know i I didn't know what the date was
[4350.32 → 4358.16] I didn't know the date I know the date of her birthday I just didn't know the date today so I got
[4358.16 → 4364.32] my train ticket, and it had the date in big bold letters on it, I went holy
[4364.32 → 4378.48] um, so anyway point is yeah yeah that's a big l big f big oof big everything
[4380.00 → 4385.60] so I'm I'm just trying to say I'm sympathetic okay let's go back let's go back to Felix's thing so I'm
[4385.60 → 4390.80] just saying I get it I get it i i i I'm I'm in I think it's pretty much done I'm in different brain
[4390.80 → 4399.68] mode I'm just going to see if it says jamming and I end up not playing anybody oh god it's kind of weird
[4405.20 → 4410.80] all right okay we'll call it we'll call it there hey you know what um thanks Felix for watching the
[4410.80 → 4416.96] video I'm glad you enjoyed it I'm glad you recognized that I wasn't trying to roast you too hard it's not
[4416.96 → 4421.44] it's not really my jam like I don't want to start any drama with anyone i legitimately just want to
[4421.44 → 4427.76] help, and you know I like you, you seem like a nice guy I've tuned into your stream a handful of times
[4427.76 → 4433.36] just in the lead up to this just kind of being like okay who exactly are we like pseudo collabing with
[4433.92 → 4441.20] seems you seem like a nice guy um i you know maybe a bit of a scatterbrain i but I get it so I love that
[4441.20 → 4450.08] he says in his stream there I'm a dm him yeah he didn't I think like so he's honest okay he's honest
[4450.08 → 4455.52] I'm a dm him but by the way I never dm anyone because I get grooving fair enough I get it
[4458.56 → 4463.84] i think you have to be like at that size on twitch, and you're trying to manage that
[4463.84 → 4467.44] audience and stuff you kind of have to be a scatterbrained yeah you gotta be able to tune
[4467.44 → 4474.40] out in a certain sense and you have to be able to kind of engage like tentacle style in another
[4474.40 → 4479.12] in another sense because you got to be able to like take all this input I mean I've said it time and time
[4479.12 → 4486.24] again I have I I don't envy streamers at all you know even the massive ones that are making a million
[4486.24 → 4491.60] dollars a month or five million dollars a month or whatever it is like you know what power to
[4491.60 → 4498.72] them I wish them all the success in the world I want absolutely no part of it whatsoever because
[4499.52 → 4507.60] on that job looks way too hard for me truthfully like I stream from time to time like i i I do it
[4507.60 → 4514.88] enough and i and i know video presentation I know online media well enough that even though I'm
[4514.88 → 4520.08] not going to call myself some kind of master twitch streamer or anything I know enough to know that I don't
[4520.08 → 4525.44] know enough and to know that I don't have it I don't get it I don't get what it takes like I could
[4525.44 → 4530.72] survive as a twitch streamer but I would never I would never be a top tier personality in that space
[4531.76 → 4539.92] we've even had some perfect ideas I think for stream style content longer form stream
[4539.92 → 4545.44] style content, but that's one of the reasons why I think we've never really yeah dove into them yeah
[4545.44 → 4549.84] yeah because yeah it kind of takes a different type of person it's a different kind
[4549.84 → 4555.04] of mind man uh float plane is reminding me about the sticker book I couldn't find it I am I'm so
[4555.04 → 4559.44] disappointed right now I'm sure I have it somewhere so I'm going to do my best you know what actually i just
[4559.44 → 4585.92] have one more idea one sec nope I don't have it so no I'm sorry I can't, I can't find it unfortunately
[4585.92 → 4592.88] uh we've got a couple other topics today that we should probably talk about though Facebook is
[4592.88 → 4598.88] blocking all news posts sorry what's that they're doing everything they're blocking news posts they're
[4598.88 → 4605.92] making watches they're they're yeah they're all over the place so in Australia and Canada which have
[4605.92 → 4613.12] in common that they are considering some kind of link tax legislation Facebook committed to blocking
[4613.12 → 4618.88] Australian news content entirely on its platform rather than complying with Australia's proposed
[4618.88 → 4624.88] news media bargaining code and so how the block works is Australian news publishers cannot share or
[4624.88 → 4631.44] post content no news link can be viewed or shared by an Australian user and international users cannot
[4631.44 → 4638.96] see or share Australian news content but as everyone should have expected like absolutely everyone when this
[4638.96 → 4646.56] happened they categorically failed in a lot of different brutal ways one of which is hilarious
[4646.56 → 4652.88] uh a lot of pages were caught in the crossfire because obviously the filter wasn't perfect obviously
[4652.88 → 4661.84] obviously um things that were caught in the crossfire where fire departments food banks charities and even Facebook's own page
[4661.84 → 4674.72] so good oh my goodness whoops daisy the uh Australian competition and consumer commissions proposed legislation
[4674.72 → 4680.96] that would make search and social giants pay to link to Australian news content essentially the government is
[4680.96 → 4687.92] trying to tackle the the being the middleman of the imbalance between publishers and platforms yeah uh the law
[4687.92 → 4693.84] would ensure platforms are notified of any major algorithmic changes the platforms make as well which
[4694.96 → 4700.48] is pretty problematic I can see why Facebook would just say no forget it then we're out because if I'm
[4700.48 → 4706.72] Facebook yeah I consider my that alone never mind just the money that it's going to cost them to pay
[4706.72 → 4716.16] Rupert Murdoch's empire um for the privilege of you know sharing that that news um aside from that if I'm
[4716.16 → 4724.88] a company like Facebook my algorithm is that's the keys to the castle like i I've spent millions upon
[4724.88 → 4732.64] millions of dollars developing this algorithm that makes me able to keep people sucked into their phones
[4732.64 → 4738.32] like absolutely nothing else on the planet there's no way I must start just like telling because remember
[4738.32 → 4743.20] they tell anybody they tell everybody yes yeah I'm not I'm not just going to start telling people what I'm
[4743.20 → 4747.84] doing with my algorithm because and you know I've talked to I've talked to google about this a lot with
[4747.84 → 4754.96] respect to YouTube whenever you notify or inform anybody about these changes immediately they start
[4754.96 → 4761.76] to game it and people are going to try to game the system anyway but at least you know security through
[4761.76 → 4769.12] obscurity right like by obfuscating it you at least slow down the cat and mouse game and if you constantly
[4769.12 → 4774.72] change it while always obfuscating it hopefully you can keep people in the dark enough that it's a
[4774.72 → 4782.16] more level playing field uh meanwhile uh hold on a second google has already inked about a billion
[4782.16 → 4789.28] dollars in deals with publishers there so google is going actually kind of sort of good guy here um
[4790.08 → 4795.84] trying to want to see it yeah I don't know I mean i I get it I get it you know there's a value to
[4795.84 → 4802.80] there's a value to reporting there's a value to news media, and it's clear that that business has
[4802.80 → 4809.28] become unsustainable in a way like especially doing it properly has become unsustainable and so finding
[4809.28 → 4814.64] some way to prop it up is honestly not I don't know that this is the right approach but finding some
[4814.64 → 4822.40] way to prop up journalism is not a terrible goal at the very in a weird way um because this is for search
[4822.40 → 4831.76] right as well so I wonder what this would do to setups like duck go um like in a way are they
[4831.76 → 4837.04] effectively like crushing everyone other than media giants because who's going to be able to
[4837.04 → 4841.04] build a system like this and I don't I don't know the terms I have no idea what the terms are
[4842.48 → 4849.52] my understanding is that it's mostly targeting the big players on both sides yeah okay um so meanwhile in
[4849.52 → 4855.76] that would be good meanwhile in Canada we don't have a clear idea of what Canada's approach to a
[4855.76 → 4862.32] link tax is going to be uh just weighing options but Facebook is proactively taking steps against
[4862.32 → 4869.04] Facebook and uh Stephen Gilbert has condemned Facebook's action and vowed that Ottawa will not
[4869.04 → 4874.48] be deterred from drafting similar legislation can you imagine that Luke if Facebook just like pulled out
[4874.48 → 4880.88] out of Canada I mean how easy would it be then to just be like hey you know mom maybe don't be on
[4880.88 → 4885.92] Facebook, and then we could just use something else my parents don't really yeah we still communicate
[4885.92 → 4890.96] with the overall family that way I guess but actually no it's the digital phone book though
[4892.48 → 4897.44] I think my mom's been keeping up with the wind show because my mom's been communicating with everyone
[4897.44 → 4901.28] through signal I just thought about that over the last few weeks it's moved over
[4901.28 → 4906.48] hmm interesting I know she does remind me every once in a while we'll talk about something she's
[4906.48 → 4913.04] like you know I do watch that's hilarious so she heard you swear she heard you say that bad word
[4913.04 → 4920.80] she probably did she probably did our last big story of the week the Xbox Series X got an update
[4920.80 → 4928.88] that's giving console gamers 60 plus fps consistently via their fps boost tech uh for select previous
[4928.88 → 4933.20] generation games, so five previous gen games are going to get major frame rate improvements on the
[4933.20 → 4940.40] series x including Far Cry 4 new super lucky's tale sniper elite 4 UFC 4 watchdogs 2 and there are more
[4940.40 → 4945.44] titles that are going to be coming so it requires no extra work from developers this is a system level
[4945.44 → 4952.08] optimization which is basically as far as I can tell just means a validation procedure that the game will
[4952.08 → 4957.84] just like run at that frame rate and then unlocking it um, but the good news for gamers is that the new tech
[4957.84 → 4963.12] gives gamers a reason to actually go back and replay older backwards compatible titles that have fps
[4963.12 → 4970.96] boost enabled for a better experience aka pc gaming you know I've been meaning for you, you know what
[4970.96 → 4976.48] yeah I was talking about how i I don't have professional twitch streaming you know in my blood or whatever
[4976.48 → 4981.76] but you know what I'm going to do some twitch streaming maybe not this weekend because i have to work this weekend
[4981.76 → 4991.44] but I'm going to replay far cry one I have been meaning to replay far cry one for years on the best hardware I want to do it
[4991.44 → 4992.64] were you ever into Diablo
[4993.68 → 5003.44] Diablo one okay i I didn't really paying that much attention so i I'm pretty sure they're remastering Diablo 2 but I think they might also be remastering Diablo 1.
[5003.44 → 5011.84] that could be pretty fun remastering Diablo 1 I can't think of a reason to remaster Diablo 1 it was an extremely shallow game
[5013.04 → 5018.56] like i i I liked it as a kid but i I would, I don't think as an adult I could get into a game
[5019.36 → 5023.92] like i think blizzard's current strategy is okay maybe it's just Diablo 2.
[5024.40 → 5025.92] I think it's just Diablo 2.
[5025.92 → 5034.64] I think their current strategy is to just re-release everything they possibly can, I mean they're they're they're remastering and re-release or maybe not remastering I don't know I wasn't paying that much attention
[5034.80 → 5044.00] but lost Vikings is having a re-release of sorts on like every platform on the planet along with a couple other of their older games but I wasn't as familiar with them
[5044.16 → 5051.60] some racing game that I know they're famous for but again i I don't know um and a shooting game that I had never heard of before
[5051.60 → 5057.36] I still remember this super weird blizzard game that was like you're supposed to like to kill chickens or something like that
[5059.28 → 5068.72] i I remember yeah I remember um oh man where is it yeah something something uh
[5068.72 → 5074.00] one of my friends in high school showed it to me, it was like on Mac or something like that I was
[5074.00 → 5078.80] like I've never I've never heard of this game before this is made by blizzard and then i I've never been able
[5078.80 → 5088.80] to find any information about it again and I think all you pretty much did was you like had a crosshair, and you just like slaughtered chickens or something I don't know if anyone remembers
[5088.80 → 5099.92] maybe I'm just totally out to lunch uh if anyone three games that they're releasing that I'm talking about is it's the blizzard arcade collection, and it's the lost Vikings blackthorn
[5099.92 → 5107.84] and rock and roll racing oh rock and roll racing is sick that's a great game I'd never played it oh it's so good for Super Nintendo
[5108.88 → 5114.56] yeah i I like knew about it, we just we never had it and back then that was a know oh i uh
[5114.56 → 5118.80] I didn't let anyone knew at it because so I couldn't sneaker it either I never had it back then either
[5120.48 → 5127.36] so yeah, but you know emulators it's yeah the soundtrack is like amazing its rock and roll racing it's its freaking awesome
[5127.36 → 5134.80] well I think that's pretty much it for the show today you guys thank you for tuning in we will see
[5134.80 → 5142.00] you again next week same bad time same bad channel apparently it's not rock and roll racing its mega
[5142.00 → 5150.00] race something like that what is apparently I'm you know what we're going to do it I never raid
[5150.00 → 5156.08] channels, but we're gonna we're going to raid QC because you know what the heck what why don't we do it so
[5156.08 → 5160.32] if anyone's watching over on YouTube or over on float plane head over to twitch we're gonna start
[5160.32 → 5166.88] the raid and uh we're going to start the raid after the outro plays super chats oh, oh wait no we're
[5166.88 → 5173.04] going to start the raid after we do a few super chats thank you Luke um build dog says running that train
[5173.04 → 5179.04] game hey thanks switchblade says we all know YouTube is perfectly balanced and cannot be exploited yeah
[5179.04 → 5184.08] yeah yeah yeah yeah Gregory my Australian Facebook feed has no links except sponsored
[5184.08 → 5188.08] adverts and YouTube videos it's all just friends posts and memes it's kind of nice, but it's going
[5188.08 → 5192.56] to force armies back to TV and other mainstream media that's one fair point I'm not convinced
[5192.56 → 5197.20] Facebook news is any better if I've learned anything from the spiffing Brit literally nothing is perfectly
[5197.20 → 5202.24] balanced uh Justin Carlisle says first time live on the wan hoping for help with my mouse problem
[5203.04 → 5208.40] I have quite large hands and the g502 is not working for me, I wanted to know what's a good large fps
[5208.40 → 5213.44] mouse looking at the model o wireless Luke you got any thoughts on big baseball mitt size hand mice
[5215.20 → 5223.04] oh you're muted I have generally liked the larger format Logitech mice I have always found that they
[5223.04 → 5229.60] work a bit better with my hands um but yeah I know there's a trend and I understand why for mice to be
[5229.60 → 5235.84] smaller and lighter these days and I get it I get it i just it's not really for me uh Gabriel Johnson
[5235.84 → 5239.52] says last episode you talked about letting only fans people on float plane would you let weed
[5239.52 → 5244.72] YouTubers on flight the float plane I don't see why not I mean we wouldn't allow illegal content
[5244.72 → 5253.68] but as far as my understanding is uh there's a lot of weed content that would not qualify as illegal so
[5254.96 → 5260.96] we're not going to allow anything dangerous like if they're showing you as with everything because we
[5260.96 → 5267.84] we monitor the content on the platform we review uh new creators uh it would be on a case-by-case basis
[5267.84 → 5273.92] yeah uh Abdul says I guys about to head to bed talk to you tomorrow falls in UK all right fair enough
[5274.56 → 5279.36] ilia says so it's been two weeks with Madison what are your impressions any regrets no she's she's doing
[5279.36 → 5286.64] a great job I think she's doing an absolutely fantastic bang up job um I mean we hired her based on
[5286.64 → 5292.16] her qualifications not based on the community saying to hire her we just happened to be finally
[5292.16 → 5297.04] at a point where we were ready to hire a social media coordinator so we went with someone that we
[5297.04 → 5304.80] knew our audience was already in love with who we thought had a good amount of both you know competence
[5304.80 → 5312.56] and memory um that we thought would be a good reflection of you know our image and our approach
[5312.56 → 5318.16] to community interaction I think she's been doing a great job all right its raid time hopefully you
[5318.16 → 5334.40] guys are over on twitch if you want to participate we're doing it see you later let's roll that outro
[5342.56 → 5354.32] okay
