[0.00 → 6.88] and we're live welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for
[6.88 → 13.60] you guys today starting of course with AMD's upcoming am5 CPU socket that's right no more
[13.60 → 23.20] am1 am2 am3 or am4 we have now moved on to five and there's some questionable counting that got
[23.20 → 29.84] us here because am1 was never a thing and also there was am2 plus in there somewhere along the
[29.84 → 36.16] line, but those are minor details uh those days are those days are behind us uh in other news this week
[36.16 → 43.52] uh windows no that's boring boring you know what let's talk about it's a great it's a
[43.52 → 49.60] great show yes we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today we got one we got one good topic
[49.60 → 56.88] uh we also have winged i want to talk about winged this is yet another Linux feature that is making
[56.88 → 65.20] its way to windows much to the bafflement of many Windows users who just have never experienced such
[65.20 → 72.24] uh such grace such seamless operation i okay we don't need to talk about that yeah we're gonna
[72.24 → 79.44] talk about it later Luke later 16 gigs of ram is not enough okay it's not enough moved on that was
[79.44 → 85.36] a spec that we used years ago as the suggested amount of ram it's not enough it's also not
[85.36 → 90.24] enough in iPads anymore okay it's not enough in anything what 16 gigs not enough for an iPad
[90.24 → 96.24] figure it out didn't they just get 16 gigs yeah maybe okay what else they're doing over there okay
[96.88 → 106.24] um also i want to go over this one Amazon to install meditation kiosks in their work in their
[106.24 → 113.12] in their warehouses okay nice okay so okay Luke is actually hearing about this for the first time
[113.12 → 119.52] there's actually been one new development since then that i am aware of okay um i believe they have
[119.52 → 125.60] removed the tweet and the video talking about this I'm sure we can still get access to it though it's a
[125.60 → 131.44] boozy it's a boozy we're gonna talk about it let's roll that intro okay sounds good
[131.44 → 137.12] yeah it's its exactly as bad as you think it is
[139.20 → 140.00] it sounds like
[142.40 → 151.12] just the naming of things is so amazing yeah it's like how do you manage to be a company this size
[151.12 → 159.68] with this many smart people working there and just have absolutely no idea whatsoever i just can't even
[159.68 → 168.08] i can't even begin to describe the out of toughness um our show today is brought to you by uh dot tech
[168.72 → 174.72] anchor and PDF element I'm just going to go ahead and click the viewer activity tab so that I'm not
[174.72 → 181.84] going to miss out on the uh not going to miss out on the super chats people send in that i will probably
[181.84 → 186.40] not read anyway don't send super chats because i usually don't see them and let's go ahead and jump
[186.40 → 193.04] right into the big news man do you remember when it was intel CPU launches that were exciting
[194.40 → 199.84] yeah do you also remember when CPUs weren't like absolute massive changes i was actually expecting
[199.84 → 207.60] you to say no because it's been a while oh well i mean that's true i it's its yeah it's its been such
[207.60 → 215.52] a weird flip remember the 2600k you know what i mean yeah well okay if like if you look back at
[215.52 → 220.00] when you and i started working together which was a long time ago at this point over 10 years now
[220.72 → 228.08] we have flipped from all intel news to all AMD news basically it's been such a long time you'd
[228.08 → 233.52] think that at least some point in there it would essentially be a time when it was like really
[233.52 → 239.84] notably both, and we had a little bit of that crossover here there, but it's pretty much just been
[239.84 → 246.00] all intel news or all AMD news yeah really weird yeah we're in the AMD era and this is according to
[246.00 → 252.08] a leak from executable fix who apparently has a pretty good track record with AMD leaks uh that the
[252.08 → 263.92] upcoming AMD am5 socket will be LGA 1718, so this will be similar to most intel and all of AMD's
[263.92 → 270.16] thread ripper processors in that instead of using pins on the bottom of the CPU and then little holes
[270.16 → 278.00] in the socket on the motherboard it's going to use pads on the CPU and then a Langer array of pins
[278.00 → 284.80] uh in the motherboard itself so we've actually got a display capture this image is from at enough uh
[284.80 → 289.84] oops see daisies that oh no oh now I've moved other things oh that's okay there we go
[289.84 → 299.12] um supposedly this is what am5 Rafael will look like from the bottom that's right you're seeing
[299.12 → 314.40] it here first unless you follow at XQ CXC fix on Twitter um that's all 1718 pins now let's talk about
[314.40 → 324.64] what exactly Rafael is going to be basically we are expecting support for ddr4 and 5, so this is
[324.64 → 330.56] apparently going to be a backwards compatible platform which is something we have actually
[330.56 → 339.20] seen before I'm trying to remember the last time it would have been was it i mean a mobile it's really
[339.20 → 347.28] common to see support for you know ddr3 or ddr4 especially when uh low power ddr3 was a thing and
[347.28 → 354.08] low power ddr4 wasn't a thing, yet you saw a lot of Ultrabooks that were still using low power ddr3 but
[354.08 → 361.28] I'm trying to remember the last time this was a significant feature on desktop the only time i
[361.28 → 366.00] specifically remember it and I'm I'm wouldn't be surprised at all if it happened again after this but
[366.00 → 371.52] i remember the ddr3 ddr2 mix boards there was quite a few of those that was definitely a big thing
[371.52 → 380.56] so allele no idea how to pronounce that over on float plane says am3 supported ddr3 and ddr2
[380.56 → 384.88] yep yeah that's correct, so there was no there wasn't really much of a compelling performance
[384.88 → 390.96] difference on that platform between ddr2 and ddr3 and i remember that there was a lot of discussion
[390.96 → 395.84] around whether you should spend the extra on ddr3 at that time uh there were even boards that
[395.84 → 402.48] like you said Luke had support for both ddr2 and ddr3 in fact i remember this really amazing ass
[402.48 → 409.04] rock board way back in the day oh man what was that thing called uh ddr1 ddr2 i think i had support
[409.04 → 418.72] for ddr1 and ddr2 um nah this isn't the one I'm thinking of but this is definitely a really cool board
[418.72 → 426.64] that did happen to have support for both ddr1 and ddr2 the 775 dual vista now this was as you guys
[426.64 → 432.08] might have guessed around the time of Windows vista um and i guess this is one of those uh
[433.44 → 441.20] one of those kind of weird marketing moves um kind of like AMD and their Athlon XPS around the time of
[441.20 → 447.28] Windows XP you know hey yeah it's like it's great for vista and this is a really cool board because it's got
[447.28 → 457.36] support for ddr1 and ddr2 memory and then even more interestingly it's got support for AGP and PCI Express
[457.36 → 466.32] so the idea was that you could go uh core 2 duos so this was just such a leap forward in CPU
[466.32 → 474.16] performance at that time you could go core 2 duos but while only investing in a new CPU uh cooler if i
[474.16 → 483.60] recall correctly and no yeah if you were already intel i don't believe you needed a new cooler so
[483.60 → 488.32] new CPU new motherboard that's it you carry forward your ram you carry forward your graphics card and
[488.32 → 493.52] you can update them at your leisure and as long as you weren't heavy into overclocking it was probably
[493.52 → 502.96] fine technically it had overclocking features but you know it wasn't it wasn't great uh the one i was
[502.96 → 512.40] actually thinking of that i daily drove is this one yeah this one so sorry this one was not actually a
[512.40 → 522.00] ddr2 and ddr1 board this was an only ddr1 uh but this thing was super neat in that it had uh PCI Express
[522.00 → 528.96] and AGP as well uh so there you go there's your brown AGP slot as well as your PCI Express slot and then it
[528.96 → 537.68] also had this uh crazy changes yellow slot here that allowed you to go from uh socket was it socket
[537.68 → 544.48] 754 to 939 or something like that i can't remember what this stupid thing oh future CPU port that's
[544.48 → 550.40] right they didn't know because they had actually done a previous board where you went from 754 to 939
[550.40 → 554.48] that wasn't this one, although you know what this doesn't actually seem quite right either because
[554.48 → 561.12] the one that i had was actually like quite overclockable oh man it doesn't matter the
[561.12 → 570.32] point is i have gotten off the rails a little bit here am5 is going to have support for ddr4 and 5
[570.32 → 577.92] along with PCI Express gen 5 that is freaking crazy to think about like wrap your brain around this Luke
[577.92 → 586.48] not that long ago i was working in a computer store okay selling PCI Express gen one motherboards
[586.48 → 594.96] it's been a while Luke it's okay so i was in the computer store um oh man hold on a second let me
[594.96 → 602.96] just let me just try to shop from your computer store okay, okay this was the kind of motherboard
[602.96 → 609.44] okay that i was selling in the computer store at that time this is the a8 n32 SLI oh no that's not
[609.44 → 615.28] the deluxe whatever it's the 8 n32 slit hey were right around the same time uh this is a PCI Express
[615.92 → 624.48] 16x slot that was the state of the freaking art at the time, and you would put your super high-powered
[624.48 → 632.48] uh you know what would that have been around that time like uh like 8800 GTX no not even holy crap it
[632.48 → 644.88] was pre that this is like 6800 uh 6800 like 70 7800 eras um wow okay it was a while ago uh and that was
[644.88 → 649.92] all the bandwidth you could possibly imagine needing even for a high-end graphics card there were even
[649.92 → 658.16] questions at the time about whether we even needed PCI Express because AGP was more than enough for even
[658.16 → 666.16] the highest-end graphics cards now since then we have doubled our PCI Express bandwidth one two three
[666.16 → 674.24] four times so what that means is PCIE hold on generations let's have a look at what the actual
[674.24 → 684.16] numbers work out to here so that first generation per link was about 250 megabytes per second so 16 links
[684.16 → 694.16] would have been oh man i need my calculator 16 would have been about four no sorry excuse me uh 16 would
[694.16 → 703.76] have been about eight gigabytes a second all right so now moving on to PCI Express 5 let's have a look
[703.76 → 708.64] at uh let's have a look at a motherboard again here we go pulling up my screen
[708.64 → 718.08] now here we go let's pull up that board again so now oh crap this doesn't even have any PCI
[718.08 → 724.64] express 1x slots oh that makes my point very, very challenging to make i need a board with PCI Express 1x
[724.64 → 731.60] slots motherboard i swear to you guys I'm going to get there this is the problem with doing these things
[731.60 → 744.80] live there we go that right down there are you kidding me okay there we go that little tiny
[744.80 → 752.72] thing down there on the bottom that now has half of the bandwidth or will with PCI Express gen 5 half of
[752.72 → 760.48] the bandwidth of what used to be a full-sized PCI Express 16x slot so you could theoretically take one of
[760.48 → 768.80] those like graphics cards from back then plug it into this little tiny slot, and you would get
[768.80 → 775.92] absolutely the full performance that it was capable of and yes modern GPUs quite a bit faster but have
[775.92 → 784.56] we even fully begun to take advantage of PCI Express gen 4 not freaking likely with that said there's a lot
[785.12 → 792.64] of benefits to having much, much faster PCI Express like GPUs aren't the only thing that needs to have
[792.64 → 799.92] a ton of bandwidth allocated to it any more nowadays the Io on a motherboard is crazy like every time you
[799.92 → 807.20] want to put an USB uh you know 10 gigabits per second port on your motherboard it's like oh okay yeah that's
[807.20 → 817.04] a gigabyte per second and I'm I'm rounding obviously, but that's uh freaking that's a freaking
[817.04 → 823.12] lot of bandwidth so if you want to have you know an entire back panel of your motherboard that's covered
[823.12 → 828.64] in these that's covered in these ports like oh yeah okay now all of a sudden being able to go much
[828.64 → 833.68] much faster per lane is going to make a huge difference also in you know the server space
[833.68 → 839.68] oh I'm getting boring now uh being able to split these PCI Express lanes out so you could actually
[839.68 → 845.68] take even modern graphics cards and go okay yeah we've got you know 16 lanes which we could use for
[845.68 → 853.04] a single 16x slot, or we could take those 16 lanes split them out be running compute on 16 different GPUs
[853.04 → 858.56] that are all connected to it or realistically actually a lot more than that with PCI Express switching
[858.56 → 864.08] and get just unheard of connectivity and performance out of this next generation CPUs
[864.08 → 870.24] so super exciting PCI Express gen 5 is it going to make your graphics card in your gaming rig faster
[870.24 → 876.00] yeah no not really um but does it have a lot of potential absolutely there's going to be some
[876.00 → 883.12] challenges though um Tom's hardware spoke with microchip which develops PCI Express gen 5 switches and
[883.12 → 888.40] the company told them that gen 5's requirements will be even more arduous for motherboard
[888.40 → 894.32] manufacturers likely increasing cost even more than what the industry had to absorb in the move
[894.32 → 899.52] to gen 4 which was pretty significant there were cases where we even saw motherboards in the server
[899.52 → 905.04] space not necessarily the consumer space where they would have the same basic motherboard but one of
[905.04 → 912.72] them was gen 4 capable because it meant much thicker traces and one of them was and in some cases i believe
[912.72 → 918.32] more uh PCB layers and then one that was just gen 3 capable if you didn't need it, it would just
[918.32 → 926.16] run at a slower speed for the PCI Express lanes um, but that would be less expensive um
[928.08 → 930.48] hmm now this is interesting
[933.60 → 941.28] oh wait what the hell is going on which is intended until all okay i completely read this wrong i need to
[941.28 → 949.68] stop doing this show live can i rewind Luke this is a little embarrassing because AMD apparently
[949.68 → 958.72] is not moving forward with gen 5 on the upcoming dozen platform it is intel's alder lake that is expected
[958.72 → 964.72] to have PCI Express gen 5 support so um yeah
[964.72 → 972.56] yeah well all right i guess I'm excited for alder lake but also not because it's going to make your
[972.56 → 979.12] GPU any faster oh and another thing it's probably not going to make any faster is your SSD so
[981.28 → 990.56] the move to gen 4 even for consumer SSDs has been mostly a marketing one so yes you can actually buy SSDs
[990.56 → 998.64] today that have really gigantic numbers on the box like if you buy a Samsung 980 pro for example it's
[998.64 → 1005.52] going to have this massive seven gigabytes per second you know number advertised on the outside of the
[1005.52 → 1012.88] box but the reality of it is as drive capacities go up the only way that manufacturers are able to
[1012.88 → 1020.32] achieve that in a cost-effective manner is by using Nan flash that stores more and more bits per cell
[1020.32 → 1026.64] and when you store more bits per cell you get more capacity for a given uh for a given Nan module
[1026.64 → 1032.88] but what you're excuse me uh for a given NAND package but what you are missing out on is right
[1032.88 → 1038.64] endurance and in particular right performance so while you're going to have these drives that are
[1038.64 → 1044.80] able to saturate your PCI Express gen 4 link and i would be amazed if you don't see manufacturers pushing
[1044.80 → 1052.80] the limit so that you can saturate a gen 5 by 4 link um as soon as you actually write to it for a
[1052.80 → 1060.32] sustained amount of time you are going to start to see that performance not just trail off but fall
[1061.04 → 1068.40] off a cliff because the Nan flash just can't keep up and even high performance drives like the 980 pro is
[1068.40 → 1075.92] TLC now if i recall correctly although Samsung doesn't actually market it that way yeah 3-bit TLC
[1075.92 → 1085.36] versus the 2-bit NFC of the previous generation so um yeah it's cool but um i don't know probably not
[1085.36 → 1091.68] going to probably not going to be a game changer at least for consumers well yeah a lot of this just
[1091.68 → 1097.04] smells like they're just trying to be ready they might end up using this uh socket for a while
[1097.04 → 1102.24] right so we'll see yeah that's true and i mean a big part of it too is a lot of the research and
[1102.24 → 1107.44] development that you do for your server platform uh will often end up in your workstation platform
[1107.44 → 1112.08] which ends up your consumer platform and in some cases even vice versa it's sort of whatever's
[1112.08 → 1118.56] whatever's driving whatever's driving r d forward it's not like you're going to go ahead and throw
[1118.56 → 1125.84] that work away because oh well the smelly workstation division did that so we simply won't
[1125.84 → 1131.28] use this technology in the server space i mean if anything the cost to develop this stuff is
[1131.28 → 1137.52] so astronomically high you want to reuse as much as possible wherever you can, I mean a perfect example of
[1137.52 → 1146.56] that is the uh the LGA 11 series like the know the consumer sized Leon chips that intel makes
[1146.56 → 1152.24] where the only major difference is that they've got a couple of you know switches flipped in them
[1152.24 → 1159.12] so they support ECC and something else i can't remember they're they're the exact same silicon
[1159.12 → 1167.84] because the cost is so much lower to develop that once and then flip around some switches so these
[1167.84 → 1172.72] guys pay a bit more and these guys pay a bit less, and you know hopefully your margins land somewhere right
[1172.72 → 1180.56] in the middle compared to actually developing completely discrete uh discrete dies to go in two
[1180.56 → 1192.08] completely separate product lines um so for those of you not familiar the move to a LGA rather than a
[1192.08 → 1199.68] PGA socket is going to have an impact it means that you'll be less likely to drop a CPU and knock a pin
[1199.68 → 1206.40] off of it or bend it which is good it also means you're painstakingly tried to repair it yeah yeah that
[1206.40 → 1212.32] was fun um it means you're less likely to accidentally pull the CPU out of the socket if your thermal compound
[1212.32 → 1222.32] kind of suctions it on there, but it also means that your motherboard is going to be much um easier
[1222.32 → 1228.24] to damage as well now this is interesting Jake put in this topic, and he says in my experience it's
[1228.24 → 1233.84] usually easier to repair pins on a motherboard than a CPU because there's less chance of breaking a pin
[1233.84 → 1239.84] off, and it's less likely they'll get damaged in the first place that's actually a strong disagree from
[1239.84 → 1246.64] me my experience is quite different i don't have trouble repairing CPU pins compared to repairing
[1247.20 → 1251.44] motherboard pins because i find the way the motherboard pins work is they're kind of like
[1251.44 → 1256.40] they're kind of bent in like a camera and then like a third thing they've got like kind of these
[1256.40 → 1265.60] two bends to them and the very end is extremely fine like it's an extremely thin bit of metal and
[1265.60 → 1271.20] so you can actually break the little ball on the end off quite easily if you spend a while trying to
[1271.20 → 1277.28] kind of bend it back and forth now I've had situations where I've had one joint missing off
[1277.28 → 1285.04] of the little finger and I've managed to just wrench what remained kind of out and up high enough to
[1285.04 → 1291.36] make contact with the pad on the bottom of the CPU, but it's not something that i would prefer, and it's
[1291.36 → 1296.80] not something that i would recommend and i also just find all the little bends and stuff a lot more
[1296.80 → 1302.80] distracting to look at, and it's a lot harder to tell if I've got it aligned perfectly because with a pin
[1302.80 → 1310.48] all you have to do is align it in x and y right but in the socket you have to do x y and z you have to
[1310.48 → 1314.56] make sure you have it at the right height, or you're not going to have enough pressure once the CPU
[1314.56 → 1320.80] is secured into the socket by the hold down clip so i can't say I've shared Jake's experience but
[1320.80 → 1327.20] that doesn't invalidate his experience uh all it means is that your mileage may vary i was going to
[1327.20 → 1333.36] say i especially to try to defend Jake here i think from his experience he's probably mostly deals
[1333.36 → 1341.12] with just like lightly smashed uh, uh socket pins right and in those situations it's pretty easy to fix
[1342.48 → 1349.60] but having dealt with a lot of damaged CPUs in my time it's also been pretty easy to do the old like
[1349.60 → 1356.32] just run the credit card down the lane thing yeah and it just or whatever type of thin material you
[1356.32 → 1361.84] have that's solid just run it in between a few times and everything will kind of straighten up nicely
[1361.84 → 1366.24] and those are usually the problems that you have CPU pins we don't usually run into the situation
[1366.24 → 1371.68] we didn't where an entire pin is just off um what i have mostly seen is things are just bent a bit
[1371.68 → 1375.92] because it was like improperly stored or whatever you kind of bend them back pretty easily so and don't
[1375.92 → 1381.76] forget about the classic mechanical pencil trick with pins on the bottom of a CPU so you just slide
[1381.76 → 1388.24] that puppy on there straighten it out and boom oh i really don't find it that challenging yeah yeah
[1388.24 → 1395.84] there's a lot of like pretty simple tricks with uh with CPU pins i still like the idea of LGA but um
[1397.36 → 1406.16] yeah yeah i don't know experience may differ all right our next topic is uh Facebook sues India what
[1406.16 → 1413.44] does that even mean yeah a bit weird uh on Wednesday Facebook owned WhatsApp sued the Indian government
[1413.44 → 1418.56] challenging new regulations that it said could allow authorities to make people's private messages
[1418.56 → 1424.40] traceable and conduct mass surveillance that is only for Facebook to do not the Indian government yeah
[1424.40 → 1430.08] and the Indian government they got to be sitting here going like oh no oh so no we're being sued by
[1430.08 → 1435.76] Facebook that is definitely the largest of our problems right now we don't have any other issues
[1435.76 → 1445.04] currently plaguing our country oh that's okay among the're just farming for puns now
[1448.00 → 1451.04] they're also having a lot of issues with their farmers just because you didn't get that joke
[1451.04 → 1457.12] among the new rules are requirements that big social firms well just to clarify hold on actually i want
[1457.12 → 1464.08] to clarify for a second uh India is not having issues with their farmers are taking issue
[1464.08 → 1469.44] with what the Indian government is doing so that's a much better way of saying that's uh that's an
[1469.44 → 1477.20] important distinction and uh you know farmers in case you guys didn't know uh are very important
[1477.20 → 1484.40] oh yeah because without farmers eating things is pretty uh pretty key to survival yeah you need
[1484.40 → 1490.48] you need food and last time i checked you are a are a soft worthless millennial or gen z
[1490.48 → 1495.04] you're a little bit more than you're a little bit more than you're a little bit more than you're
[1495.04 → 1498.00] going to be incapable of dirtying your hands to farm your own food in your backyard also a separate
[1498.00 → 1502.88] problem is that this is two entire generations of people that cannot afford a backyard, but that's a
[1502.88 → 1508.24] whole that's a whole separate conversation to get into therefore no ability to gain that experience
[1508.24 → 1513.92] or learn how yeah so anyway actually really wanting to and certain apartment complexes being pushed into
[1513.92 → 1519.84] adding green plots, so people can have small gardens so they can learn those skills sorry continue yeah the point is uh farms are
[1519.84 → 1527.92] good and the food that comes off of them is good carry on Luke all right um among the new rules are
[1527.92 → 1533.20] requirements that big social media firms appoint Indian citizens to key compliance roles remove content
[1533.20 → 1540.64] within 36 hours of a legal order and set up a mechanism to respond to complaints uh they must also use
[1540.64 → 1549.68] automated processes to take down uh avoiding word for demonetization reasons um if i
[1549.68 → 1557.76] wasn't wearing these things and was on video doing stuff with other people i actually have no idea
[1557.76 → 1562.24] what you're talking about content well i don't want to say this because this is a demonetization
[1562.24 → 1568.08] word what pornography oh that's a demonetization word you just did it oh well i guess we're stuck with
[1568.08 → 1576.00] it now rips carry on moving on uh the case asked the Delhi high court to declare that one of the new
[1576.00 → 1582.80] it rules is a violation of privacy rights in India's constitution since it requires social media companies
[1582.80 → 1588.16] to identify the first originator of information when authorities demand it and people familiar with the
[1588.16 → 1596.48] lawsuit told this to Reuters right um Reuters yeah right there is that other thing um yeah this is
[1596.48 → 1607.44] this is long and stuff but i guess um Facebook and an odd move is trying to um protect data um yeah so
[1607.44 → 1612.24] they're basically saying that because their messages are encrypted end to end it would have to break
[1612.24 → 1617.28] encryption for receivers of messages as well as the originators in order to comply with the new law
[1618.32 → 1627.52] um oh man see that's really that's really challenging because i also can understand that aside from
[1627.52 → 1633.76] conducting mass surveillance i can also understand why with some of the problems that
[1633.76 → 1639.04] they've had with misinformation spreading on WhatsApp in India that the Indian government might
[1639.04 → 1647.12] uh might care about knowing where exactly these messages are originating people have literally died
[1647.12 → 1654.48] because of misinformation spreading on WhatsApp in India um globally probably if we're being honest
[1656.80 → 1662.40] yeah it's its it's funky because there's also the other problem where like okay if they can't do their
[1662.40 → 1667.84] their encryption stuff that they're currently doing if even is they're just adding a key for the Indian
[1667.84 → 1672.08] government any anytime this is something that i think governments globally have a really hard
[1672.08 → 1678.64] time understanding yeah anytime you add a key you aren't necessarily giving that key to everyone but
[1678.64 → 1686.72] that key is somehow available now yeah um, and it exists which is better which is sorry worse than a key
[1686.72 → 1693.76] that does not exist exactly um so you're not necessarily just handing it out to everyone, but it is
[1693.76 → 1700.40] there is now potential that somehow it could be taken um and whenever that is a reality it is often
[1700.40 → 1706.96] found that eventually that key is taken um the there are lots of governments that have a big issue
[1706.96 → 1710.48] understanding this because they're like no i want access to the stuff you don't have to give it to other
[1710.48 → 1716.88] people, but you have to give it to me, and it's like okay well that ends up giving it to everyone because
[1716.88 → 1723.28] you see the amount of like breaches i mean uh didn't Canada post just have like a 900 000 person data breach or
[1723.28 → 1727.76] something I'm not sure if i didn't see that one um at this point like everyone's just numb to it this
[1727.76 → 1736.00] stuff happens all the time um so it gets this gets really challenging too because if I'm Facebook or
[1736.00 → 1744.16] I'm twitter on the one hand i can understand a legitimate use for this kind of uh this
[1744.16 → 1752.72] kind of oversight but on the other hand it's not like India's ruling party has a great track record for
[1753.28 → 1761.52] um as far as disinformation is concerned themselves so do i really want to hand the keys to the castle
[1762.32 → 1770.32] on the premise that they're trying to you know make sure that uh you know pornography and
[1770.32 → 1776.32] disinformation can be dealt with do i really want to hand the keys to the castle over to a party that
[1776.32 → 1786.08] is probably going to abuse it and once i do, that does it open up the floodgates for other jurisdictions
[1786.08 → 1792.00] to ask for the same thing because the thing is like if I'm Facebook or I'm India and i want to operate
[1792.00 → 1799.28] according to the law that means i need to operate according to the law in every country that i operate
[1799.28 → 1807.52] and so another great example of a company seemingly absolutely kowtowing to a local government in order
[1807.52 → 1814.00] to have the right to operate there is apple uh did you see the news Luke um about i think it's just
[1814.00 → 1823.68] finished being built, but apple now has a massive data centre in China that like literally has like living
[1823.68 → 1829.68] complexes around it for all the people that need to staff this thing and basically in order for them
[1829.68 → 1837.20] to keep operating in China the Chinese government said all your use Chinese user data must be stored
[1837.20 → 1845.76] in China and as soon as it's in China um with and the data centre was built in collaboration with a
[1845.76 → 1852.96] CCP linked entity as soon as it's in China and staff from this or i forget what the name of the organization
[1852.96 → 1860.48] is but staff from there have physical access to the servers effectively apple who spends a lot of
[1860.48 → 1867.04] their time talking about the importance of user privacy and user data security has handed over the
[1867.04 → 1873.68] data of all of their Chinese customers to the Chinese government effectively now we don't we don't know
[1873.68 → 1882.32] that the CCP has actually uh exercised their ability to get access to this data uh but what we do know
[1882.32 → 1888.64] is that once you have physical access to a data centre it's just a matter of like when you feel
[1888.64 → 1896.96] like taking if it's not a matter of whether um that data is protected at all it's not at that point
[1897.68 → 1905.04] um so unless it's also inaccessible to the people that own the data centre but that's like that's the only
[1906.08 → 1911.44] yeah so there's so there's lots of concern right so back to my point about how if you want to operate in
[1911.44 → 1918.80] a given territory you are going to have to comply with the laws of that territory and so what will
[1918.80 → 1925.28] happen is if Facebook ultimately gives in to the Indian government and does this then other governments
[1925.28 → 1930.48] are going to see that and go oh wow it's that easy we just have to like to change our law to make it so
[1930.48 → 1937.20] that what is the wording uh any significant social media intermediary so they're defining it as a
[1937.20 → 1944.16] firm with over 5 million registered users um has to abide by these rules uh we've actually been going
[1944.16 → 1948.88] through a similar conversation with YouTube over the last little while regarding the Canadian bill
[1948.88 → 1958.64] c10 yes which is targeting uh well really media platforms like Netflix for example uh making sure
[1958.64 → 1964.56] that they are adhering to the same Canadian culture preservation laws that traditional broadcasters have had
[1964.56 → 1971.04] to for decades you know you have to show x amount of Canadian content alongside international content
[1971.04 → 1978.16] you have to have y amount of French content etc etc etc and they're now taking those same rules and
[1978.16 → 1984.32] they're targeting online streaming platforms and they recently revised the scope to include user generated
[1984.32 → 1992.08] content platforms like YouTube so google's having a little freak-out and part of it is that they i mean
[1992.08 → 1997.76] okay they haven't said this but I'm sure part of it is that in order to show uh you know a quota of
[1997.76 → 2004.64] Canadian content they would have to change their algorithm and also expose their algorithm to scrutiny
[2004.64 → 2009.12] from outsiders to make sure that it's actually doing what they say it's doing um it would be a lot of
[2009.12 → 2015.92] development work um they hate sharing the internal workings of how suggested recommended videos work on
[2015.92 → 2021.60] YouTube and then the bigger concern i suspect from Google's point of view is that as soon as the
[2021.60 → 2026.00] Canadian government gets this through other countries much the same as we're talking about
[2026.00 → 2031.20] here are going to look at that and go oh yeah i want that too yeah why don't why don't as well
[2031.20 → 2037.84] why don't we have control over you know what google is serving to our citizens and there's a there's a
[2037.84 → 2044.64] lot of regimes in the world that um i would be a lot more concerned than the Canadian government though
[2044.64 → 2050.80] they've hardly had um a perfect track record of late but there are a lot of regimes in the world that
[2050.80 → 2056.40] i would be even more concerned about having control over what can and can't be transmitted over social
[2056.40 → 2062.24] media i mean it really feels like we're coming to a point where the free and open internet is
[2062.24 → 2073.92] being assaulted from all sides and uh you know even the ones that like apple sort of talk a lot about
[2074.80 → 2081.44] user privacy and user security first ultimately have demonstrated that when push comes to shove
[2081.44 → 2087.04] making sure that they can put iPhones in the hands of Chinese consumers is more important than actually
[2087.04 → 2093.60] safeguarding their data and I'm only singling out apple because they're in the news about this like
[2093.60 → 2097.68] massive data centre that they basically collaborated with the Chinese government on
[2097.68 → 2103.36] that's the only reason I'm picking on them don't imagine that i imagine that google or Facebook or
[2103.36 → 2109.68] Microsoft or Amazon is ultimately going to behave any differently until i see proof otherwise
[2110.96 → 2115.68] yeah i mean a precedent for a lot of those companies has been set already that they wouldn't so
[2115.68 → 2128.64] um yeah anyway moving on i think uh oh interesting Samsung in the float plane chat says three years ago
[2128.64 → 2134.24] i got a message saying that my iCloud account was subject to move to China i was staying in China at
[2134.24 → 2139.36] that time I'm Canadian i sent a very threatening email to Apple's support and CEO's office and they
[2139.36 → 2148.32] apologized in an email very carefully yeah that sounds like the kind of thing that you would want to be
[2148.32 → 2156.56] extremely um careful about how you apologize because if you apologize to this Canadian customer
[2157.44 → 2163.60] too profusely because it was unthinkable for us to move your data to China well that's offensive to
[2163.60 → 2173.68] uh yeah Chinese customers yeah pretty much uh yeah okay um Jamal Taylor says yeah walking away from a
[2173.68 → 2181.84] billion or multi-billion person market isn't something you can just say screw it and do i mean it
[2181.84 → 2187.60] is something you can do because even though India and china have two and a half billion between them
[2187.60 → 2192.08] almost three billion i think between the two of them at this point there 's's still billions and
[2192.08 → 2200.08] billions of customers outside those places that you could still work with um now that is
[2200.08 → 2205.28] an option whether it's you know a great option for your shareholders who you are beholden to
[2205.28 → 2216.72] is a completely separate conversation yeah yeah so actually okay so in summary actually in fairness um
[2216.72 → 2224.48] Facebook's opposition to the Indian government seems to be on the surface anyway mostly about the good
[2224.48 → 2230.24] of the people and the privacy of the people so um hey maybe there's maybe there's some maybe there's
[2230.24 → 2238.72] some hope maybe mark has enough now and his Hawaiian island is enough and he doesn't need more money
[2238.72 → 2248.72] uh yeah i don't know about that either i don't know about that can I just think positive please
[2248.72 → 2258.72] sorry can I just think positive please no, no no, no why um uh straight to jail uh i i i do wonder what the ducks uh land
[2258.72 → 2264.96] uh land owning are gonna look like by the time he's uh by the time he's done i know right i know
[2264.96 → 2273.84] it seems like Bezos is in the super mega yacht ultra villain route of like half a billion-dollar yachts
[2273.84 → 2279.44] yeah okay cool so he wants the floating land yeah his yacht has a mini yacht and that mini yacht has
[2279.44 → 2284.48] a helicopter platform because it's so freaking big yeah i got a kick out of that that's for his girlfriend
[2284.48 → 2291.36] so because she's into helicopters yeah so you know might as well include that um and then the Zuck is
[2291.36 → 2299.68] going traditional you know just, just straight up a land straight up evil villain lair on an island the
[2299.68 → 2303.60] the country that you currently reside in won't let you just run it and do whatever you want well that's
[2303.60 → 2311.76] not fair just buy your own easy um I'm not going to be able to do that Luke unless i tell you about
[2311.76 → 2319.84] our sponsors here so the show is the show is brought to you by anchor thanks to oh no uh i

[2402.24 → 2407.36] help every student get equal access to computer science from our inclusive and connected future
[2407.36 → 2412.88] in the US only 47 of public high schools offer comp sci classes and out of 219 countries in the world
[2412.88 → 2421.92] only 73 or are piloting computer science in school um oh sorry 73 are only piloting comp science school
[2421.92 → 2428.32] or doing nothing at all so dot tech domains along with Namecheap are going to be donating not 10 not
[2428.32 → 2437.60] 50 but 100 of their sales proceeds to code.org as part of a campaign to help computer science and tech
[2437.60 → 2442.72] education access in the world including to young women and marginalized communities, and they asked
[2442.72 → 2450.56] us to share a personal story about uh our early interaction with technology so that's funny they
[2450.56 → 2459.60] mention sort of computers and school because uh my first interaction with computers was at school um i
[2459.60 → 2467.04] really enjoyed math circus um that was one of my favourite games right wasn't math circus
[2467.04 → 2475.44] amazing um and then probably the first like true game that i played was um well this is the oh man i
[2475.44 → 2481.52] should say this is the earliest i remember but i know from talking to my stepdad that i had exposure
[2481.52 → 2487.36] before this is just what i remember and then the first like real game that i played would have been
[2487.36 → 2494.64] Dino park tycoon and then um they wanted you to share a story about how you got into computers yeah
[2494.64 → 2500.64] honestly uh i think my the main story that i like telling was I was already pretty into computers
[2500.64 → 2505.68] at this time but i think the biggest step that i really made that solidified like no I'm doing this
[2505.68 → 2511.44] now was uh mixed with school as well one of my friends used to come over to my house before school and
[2511.44 → 2517.28] then we would carpool to school, but there was about a half an hour gap there before we left after he showed up
[2517.28 → 2522.72] and we used to play Diablo one, but we played together on the same computer, and we had two
[2522.72 → 2526.88] computers so over time i wanted to try to figure out how to get that old land connection working
[2526.88 → 2531.36] between the two of them and i had no idea what was going on because i was in elementary school but
[2531.36 → 2534.64] i figured it out, and we were eventually able to both play at the same time with two different
[2534.64 → 2539.04] characters on two different computers and that was super cool and i think that was my first
[2539.04 → 2549.68] like major step into this realm so to support the cause go to uh check out go.tech today and uh
[2551.36 → 2556.80] support it with your very own dot tech domain oh i just got signed out of Google Docs thank you
[2556.80 → 2562.40] so much for that uh hold on I'm going to go get that charger, but first you want me to go through the
[2562.40 → 2568.40] points for it no, no i want to uh i want to show you guys this, so this is a streamer uh gamer Zach
[2568.40 → 2574.96] i have no idea if this guy's a good streamer or a bad streamer but what i do know is that he is
[2574.96 → 2581.04] playing Dino park tycoon uh, so this is what it looked like these are all the different kinds of
[2581.04 → 2588.16] fences you can get for your dinosaurs you can see he's gone mega baller and put a gotten a chain link
[2588.16 → 2593.68] fence for one of his dinosaurs this was pretty much the entire park like it's a little bit bigger than
[2593.68 → 2602.16] this but um there's your ledger the thing about this game is that there was basically no way to
[2603.12 → 2610.88] have any kind of impact on the success or failure of your park you just kind of did stuff and people
[2610.88 → 2620.16] would kind of come to the park or not come to the park, and it just didn't really um it just didn't
[2620.16 → 2625.92] really matter what you did was one thing that i remember about it uh it's possible that i was just
[2625.92 → 2633.04] a kid and bad at video games, but it's also possible that it just was not a very well done game
[2635.84 → 2642.00] all right uh do you want to start another topic while i go and grab that thing sure there's a few
[2642.00 → 2648.40] exciting things in here that i want to go over together um unfortunately but I'll choose this one it's
[2648.40 → 2652.48] kind of you know this is going to be exciting for some people for sure some of you won't care some
[2652.48 → 2656.64] of you think it's amazing i think I'm kind of somewhere in the middle uh there's a huge upgrade
[2656.64 → 2665.84] coming to USB it's going to be USB 2.1 its power delivery is more than doubling from 100 watts to 240
[2665.84 → 2671.92] watts you might wonder might be wondering what that means for you that's enough to power 4k monitors and
[2671.92 → 2678.24] some gaming laptops among other devices so hopefully those massive brick cables your gaming
[2678.24 → 2684.08] laptops with these crazy cords might be able to be replaced with USB and some of your monitors
[2684.08 → 2688.56] might be able to be plugged in that way as well the more devices that adopt this i think USB is already
[2688.56 → 2694.80] like nicely here um there's enough things that i use every day that I'm like very actively using USB
[2695.84 → 2702.48] but the more things that adopted especially in this way it's exciting it is called extended power range or
[2702.48 → 2711.20] EPR there will be specific icons to label uh if USB is capable of e EPR sorry i might have said EBR i
[2711.20 → 2718.32] meant EPR uh there will be symbols labelling if it is capable of EPR or not um which of course is going
[2718.32 → 2723.92] to be confusing for some people but hopefully uh it'll be good enough there is worry of arcing when
[2723.92 → 2730.40] plugging and unplugging devices that make sense um arcing can occur when the connector is unplugged if the
[2730.40 → 2737.12] voltage differential between the plug and the receptacle v bus is greater than 12 volts USB
[2737.12 → 2741.44] implementers forum has given suggestions to manufacture on how to mitigate the arcing
[2742.56 → 2750.00] low power USB cables will soon be called standard power range or SPR these will max out at 60 watts at
[2750.00 → 2758.40] three amps 100 watt 5 amp cables we use today will be phased out, and you'll either have SPR or standard or
[2758.40 → 2764.88] EPR extended uh luckily you should be unable to fry any of your electronics if you plug the wrong cable
[2764.88 → 2771.52] into the wrong device due to um just digital handshakes oh well that sounds pretty exciting
[2771.52 → 2779.12] 240 freaking watts, and you could plug it into one of these hey remember that sponsor that we had this is
[2779.12 → 2785.36] a 65 watt charger look how small that is it looks like a normal size charger in my tiny baby hands
[2785.36 → 2793.28] i can't see it but i can imagine excuse me oh sorry here's Luke's camera there we go see it's small
[2794.40 → 2799.68] do you not have the uh do you not have the uh the discord chat window up it's not working i don't
[2799.68 → 2805.04] have a feed from you no all right well that's a shame it's all good all right what else we got oh look
[2805.04 → 2813.44] at that we've got a new shirt on LTT store wow look at this hey nice we did a new we did a new hard drive
[2813.44 → 2820.16] we did a new hard drive shirt design that's so that's so cool, and it's reflective it's reflective
[2820.16 → 2826.40] in the dark ladies and gentlemen look at this guy he's wearing it look at this other different guy
[2826.40 → 2835.84] he's going to wear it too hey one of those guys hey that gal and this guy look at that gal again hey we saw
[2835.84 → 2841.12] this guy already what's going on here so uh you guys can you guys can check that out on lttstore.com
[2841.12 → 2845.84] i do feel like there's possibly no one that does as many product images as you guys do
[2846.40 → 2851.44] which is good I'm not like that's not a bad thing we have fun with it, we got fun here, and it's also
[2851.44 → 2856.64] nice to just see it in a lot of different scenarios like tons of shirts that you buy it'll just be like
[2856.64 → 2862.00] oh it's that they have that generic photo, and they just photoshop the logo on the shirt again it's like
[2862.00 → 2871.68] i don't know no dog that's lame yeah that sucks yep all right let's talk about one let's talk about
[2871.68 → 2880.32] winged can we talk about winged now sure all right so the original source for this here
[2880.32 → 2886.40] okay perfect i can display share the original source for this here one is nonaromatic alpha over on the
[2886.40 → 2893.60] forum and the summary is Microsoft has released its first stable version of a package manager called
[2893.60 → 2901.28] winged now package managers are no new thing and not even a new thing to Windows users which i actually
[2901.28 → 2908.48] learned so that was new to me, i had never heard of chocolatey uh but an official Microsoft package
[2908.48 → 2917.84] manager like akin to what you have on Linux for example is pretty freaking new so winged has multiple
[2917.84 → 2926.24] commands including install search uninstall and upgrade and is the second Microsoft provided way to
[2926.24 → 2932.72] install software this raises some real questions about the future of the Windows store since it
[2932.72 → 2940.24] completely bypasses it so Luke uh okay sorry keep going as the better versed in Linux between the
[2940.24 → 2946.88] two of us why don't you answer for me the question that that that that that that that that
[2946.88 → 2956.40] here it is uh hold on hold on where is it ah yes talk 4456 asked okay for a window
[2956.40 → 2962.48] junkie like myself can you please explain the concept of a package manager honestly
[2962.48 → 2967.44] this sounds more complicated than just installing a program to me why do i want to go into the
[2967.44 → 2973.84] command line interface just to install something you probably don't okay well that's a good beginning
[2973.84 → 2980.32] to the answer but also why does anyone care about this tell me uh it's its nice for really advanced
[2980.32 → 2984.88] users because you can do things in batches you can verify the source that it's coming from really
[2984.88 → 2992.32] easily yep um i especially like it when you're working on a multitude of computers uh because you can
[2992.32 → 2997.84] parallelize things you can script one thing to run it on a bunch of different uh, uh devices or computers at
[2997.84 → 3005.28] once um it's its it's nice for a lot of the same reasons that almost anything in command line is nice for
[3005.28 → 3014.32] and it's just as not great as a lot of things that you do command line with are just as not great for like if is
[3014.32 → 3021.78] If you've never heard of this, and you're really not into that type of thing, and you don't spend any time in command line, et cetera, this probably isn't for you.
[3022.02 → 3022.74] And that's okay.
[3023.34 → 3030.42] And this, I also don't think this is going to completely supersede the Windows Store for the exact same reason.
[3031.80 → 3038.60] It will supersede the Windows Store in certain ways, which I think is fantastic because the Windows Store is junk.
[3038.84 → 3040.68] It's amazing how bad it is.
[3041.12 → 3041.94] It's terrible.
[3041.94 → 3046.58] So it's going to be really, really nice that you can just not use it, especially if you're a power user.
[3047.16 → 3048.80] And that's great.
[3050.16 → 3050.86] A big benefit.
[3051.38 → 3051.82] Go ahead.
[3053.06 → 3055.08] There's some really nice things about this.
[3055.16 → 3056.98] It's going to make life easier for some people.
[3057.28 → 3060.82] It's especially going to make life easier for setting up new systems.
[3061.84 → 3065.42] Creating custom ISOs was like this huge thing.
[3065.64 → 3066.70] It's going to be a lot easier.
[3067.02 → 3070.60] You can just run like a batch and have this just do everything for you.
[3070.60 → 3077.34] But for the average user, I think this will change nothing, which is completely fine, to be very clear.
[3078.14 → 3079.36] But, yeah.
[3079.36 → 3084.08] I was saying before the show, one more thing I can add.
[3084.16 → 3096.52] I was saying before the show, this is an extremely non-Balers Microsoft move because this does create a workaround for a piece of software that Microsoft already has, which is something that would have never flown back then.
[3096.52 → 3099.26] This feels much more like a modern Microsoft move.
[3099.40 → 3100.16] And I like it.
[3100.28 → 3103.14] It's going to make life notably easier for certain people.
[3103.14 → 3110.30] It just isn't going to do much for most people, which is completely fine.
[3110.80 → 3111.00] Yeah.
[3111.00 → 3111.68] Okay.
[3111.88 → 3112.32] Okay.
[3112.38 → 3115.28] Well, I actually updated Windows right before the show.
[3115.48 → 3119.68] I don't seem to have it unless there's a...
[3119.68 → 3119.78] Oh, no.
[3119.82 → 3121.58] You have to install it.
[3121.64 → 3123.48] It's included in the preview version of Windows, though.
[3123.52 → 3125.08] I think I'm in the preview version.
[3125.78 → 3128.00] Can you really access submit your request to the blah, blah, blah.
[3128.46 → 3128.94] Okay.
[3129.06 → 3129.58] Well, whatever.
[3129.72 → 3130.34] I don't...
[3130.34 → 3131.86] I apparently do not have it yet.
[3131.94 → 3132.54] I just checked.
[3132.54 → 3139.86] I wanted to do kind of a quick demo of how something like this can actually save time compared to a more traditional way of installing on Windows.
[3140.24 → 3140.38] Yeah.
[3140.38 → 3147.14] So you might think, oh, well, gee, why would I want to go into, you know, command line in order to install a program?
[3147.14 → 3161.92] Well, the reason is that it could actually be a lot faster if all you have to do is click the Windows icon or press your Windows button, type CMD, that puts you in the command prompt, and then go just Winged install Firefox.
[3162.54 → 3165.24] And then the whole thing just happens.
[3165.40 → 3169.22] No next directory, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3169.32 → 3169.94] Just none of that.
[3170.02 → 3172.14] It just installs Firefox.
[3172.14 → 3178.34] That is actually potentially faster, assuming that you don't, like, hunt and type on your keyboard.
[3178.58 → 3179.96] I will agree with that.
[3180.06 → 3184.62] I will also bring up the Sam in Float plane chat.
[3184.72 → 3188.70] So don't forget it'll make upgrades or, sorry, updates much easier for apps.
[3188.70 → 3192.90] To you, Linus, and to him, I say not necessarily.
[3193.26 → 3197.04] My only reason for that is for you, this is probably true.
[3197.62 → 3203.62] For the vast, I'd say probably over 90% of Windows users, that's not true because it's just not easier.
[3203.70 → 3204.62] They're just not going to do that.
[3204.62 → 3207.80] Because anytime you have to open command line, they're just going to freak out.
[3207.80 → 3209.86] That's fair.
[3210.02 → 3217.40] So, yeah, I would again go back to, like, this is not going to be a thing at all for the vast majority of Windows users.
[3217.56 → 3218.76] That doesn't mean it's not cool.
[3218.94 → 3219.68] It's really cool.
[3219.96 → 3220.44] I'm stoked.
[3220.70 → 3221.18] It's great.
[3222.56 → 3223.00] Awesome.
[3223.52 → 3224.58] But, yeah.
[3224.58 → 3226.54] We've got some people.
[3226.86 → 3230.24] T. Clark says, Winged just downloads installers and uninstallers.
[3230.32 → 3231.62] That doesn't sound right.
[3231.82 → 3233.32] I'm definitely going to have to try it.
[3233.46 → 3236.52] So, consider this, you know, I don't have it.
[3236.68 → 3238.18] It comes from ignorance.
[3238.34 → 3245.98] But it sounds definitely better than using the Windows Store or the Microsoft Store because I don't think anything could actually be worse than that.
[3245.98 → 3252.66] It's kind of amazing to me that the same company that makes, you know, the Xbox marketplace on Xbox.
[3252.66 → 3261.12] I mean, looking at the docs.microsoft.com article on Winged, it doesn't look like it's just downloading the installer.
[3261.30 → 3263.20] It literally says it's installing things.
[3263.36 → 3263.94] Okay, perfect.
[3264.92 → 3267.00] So, I mean, I haven't used it.
[3267.22 → 3268.36] Linus hasn't used it.
[3269.18 → 3270.26] Take this for what it is.
[3271.24 → 3272.22] But, yeah.
[3272.74 → 3277.34] In other Windows news, we've got Windows 10 2 coming.
[3278.28 → 3281.84] There's going to be a next generation Windows arriving in fall 2021.
[3281.84 → 3284.74] And it was teased at the Build 2021 Developer Conference.
[3285.24 → 3287.60] Here's the quote from Satya Nadella.
[3288.10 → 3295.60] Soon, we will share one of the most significant updates of Windows of the past decade to unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators.
[3296.08 → 3296.58] Developers.
[3296.70 → 3297.26] Developers.
[3297.36 → 3298.04] Okay, sorry.
[3298.46 → 3301.10] Codename Sun Valley 21 H2.
[3301.34 → 3303.56] You can expect more details in June at the next event.
[3303.56 → 3307.94] So, they've said in the past that Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows.
[3308.26 → 3311.56] So, it's likely that this is just another Windows 10 update.
[3311.72 → 3317.78] But the whole next generation thing could imply that this is a very major update.
[3317.78 → 3319.78] And also...
[3319.78 → 3322.96] I mean, we said this was going to happen a super long time ago.
[3323.18 → 3327.54] You can't just completely stop major innovation.
[3327.80 → 3328.56] Like, it's going to happen.
[3328.68 → 3331.16] They might just stop numbering the operating system.
[3331.30 → 3332.98] But there's going to be big jumps.
[3332.98 → 3336.12] Which could be exactly what we're looking at.
[3336.22 → 3338.88] So, preview builds have already showcased some of the coming changes.
[3339.20 → 3340.54] So, Win UI 3 integration.
[3340.78 → 3341.38] A new start menu.
[3341.50 → 3342.22] A new action centre.
[3342.30 → 3342.88] A new taskbar.
[3343.36 → 3344.14] Rounded corners.
[3344.48 → 3349.20] I mean, that sounds like enough to justify a new version of Windows back in the day when they released them every couple of years.
[3349.72 → 3350.24] Awesome, man.
[3350.28 → 3351.74] I would take rounded corners at this time.
[3351.96 → 3354.38] I'm so tired of everything being a box.
[3354.76 → 3356.46] I never liked this design language.
[3356.62 → 3357.92] I always think it looked like junk.
[3358.20 → 3360.16] At no point in time did I think it looked good.
[3360.16 → 3367.72] The first, like, Windows 8 menu thing that you had, there was no start menu.
[3367.80 → 3368.26] Do you remember that?
[3368.34 → 3369.44] I don't even remember what that was called.
[3369.80 → 3371.04] Windows 8 tiles or whatever.
[3371.48 → 3371.94] Hated it.
[3372.22 → 3372.82] Hated it now.
[3373.20 → 3375.02] You know what still looks good today?
[3376.40 → 3377.28] Windows Vista.
[3378.20 → 3378.44] Yeah.
[3380.42 → 3381.20] It does.
[3381.66 → 3386.76] As much as people hated that operating system and with decently good reason if you didn't have an absolute monster machine.
[3386.94 → 3387.20] I did.
[3387.22 → 3388.06] It looked good.
[3388.12 → 3388.48] Get wrecked.
[3388.48 → 3389.90] And this square thing.
[3390.28 → 3391.02] I didn't.
[3392.06 → 3394.00] These square things.
[3394.24 → 3394.52] I just.
[3396.02 → 3396.42] It's just.
[3396.60 → 3396.88] And like.
[3397.14 → 3397.52] So fun.
[3397.52 → 3399.74] In some places, maybe you can make it look good.
[3399.82 → 3400.54] But when that's like.
[3400.78 → 3401.40] This is how.
[3401.68 → 3403.80] Every single thing is going to look forever.
[3403.98 → 3404.80] No matter what.
[3405.00 → 3405.32] It just.
[3405.48 → 3406.00] I don't know.
[3406.10 → 3407.40] I actually hate it so much.
[3407.48 → 3408.44] I don't usually get that.
[3409.24 → 3409.64] Yeah.
[3409.76 → 3410.38] I was going to say.
[3410.52 → 3411.92] Passionate about design things.
[3412.04 → 3413.62] But I just hate this.
[3413.68 → 3415.12] Everything being flat and square.
[3415.98 → 3416.94] It's just not good.
[3416.94 → 3417.94] Flat squares everywhere.
[3417.94 → 3419.24] Oh, this is a fun one.
[3419.36 → 3422.86] So your flat squares might be a little bit easier to keep track of.
[3423.40 → 3428.56] The fix for Windows apps rearranging themselves could be part of this update.
[3428.56 → 3431.72] I have so many issues with this.
[3431.72 → 3432.04] Like.
[3432.36 → 3433.00] Oh, man.
[3433.06 → 3435.76] Do you ever open a dock in protected view mode?
[3436.26 → 3436.94] And you go to like.
[3437.24 → 3438.86] You put it where you want to have it.
[3438.94 → 3439.98] Oh, and then you click like.
[3439.98 → 3441.16] You go to make a change.
[3442.60 → 3443.26] You click.
[3443.52 → 3443.92] Yes.
[3443.98 → 3445.36] I want to edit this document.
[3445.36 → 3446.90] It's from a safe location or whatever.
[3447.02 → 3447.64] And it goes.
[3447.80 → 3449.42] And it just like moves it somewhere else.
[3449.46 → 3449.70] It's like.
[3449.78 → 3450.06] No.
[3450.06 → 3452.66] I put it where I wanted it to be.
[3452.80 → 3455.22] I wouldn't have moved it if I didn't want it there.
[3455.64 → 3455.98] So annoying.
[3455.98 → 3458.16] I think it's not quite that issue.
[3458.22 → 3460.82] But it's actually more related to users with multiple monitors.
[3461.16 → 3466.26] This is one of those issues with Windows that just shouldn't be an issue.
[3466.26 → 3473.18] Like if you unplug a monitor and an application just gets like stuck off of your screen.
[3473.18 → 3475.50] And there's no way to recall it without.
[3475.90 → 3481.70] I think there are third party tools where you can like to build something into like the context
[3481.70 → 3485.48] menu to right-click it in the taskbar and like bring it to display one or bring it to
[3485.48 → 3486.32] display two or whatever.
[3486.56 → 3488.58] But it is so annoying.
[3488.68 → 3492.42] And not just when you unplug and rep lug a monitor, but also if you're removing into a machine
[3492.42 → 3497.24] with software that doesn't have support for multi-monitor, like say, for example, I think
[3497.24 → 3499.28] the Parsec non-professional version doesn't.
[3500.64 → 3500.90] Yeah.
[3501.00 → 3502.64] So apparently there's a fix coming for that.
[3502.72 → 3504.10] Just hilarious.
[3505.32 → 3506.46] This is interesting.
[3506.62 → 3507.64] Wait, hold on.
[3507.78 → 3509.40] What what is going on here?
[3509.42 → 3511.36] Is this actually new?
[3512.02 → 3514.80] Is it is this is the Steam Pal confirmed?
[3515.76 → 3516.88] Off the option to dock.
[3517.38 → 3519.22] Oh, these are leaks.
[3519.34 → 3520.76] These are leaks from Valve.
[3520.76 → 3528.46] Apparently, they are working on a handheld, which would be exciting if Valve had any kind
[3528.46 → 3532.30] of level of commit to their hardware projects, except their VR ones.
[3533.30 → 3537.14] Remember the Valve Linux boxes, or how fast those were dropped?
[3537.88 → 3540.68] Yeah, that was really that was pretty brutal.
[3541.22 → 3542.82] Even Steam Link is dead now.
[3542.96 → 3544.44] Steam controllers are gone.
[3544.44 → 3553.80] Man, the and like good on them, you know, but the speed at which the like computer hardware
[3553.80 → 3557.42] community jumped on Steam OS was crazy.
[3557.42 → 3561.32] And then Steam just like, eh, don't care anymore.
[3561.54 → 3561.94] See you.
[3562.38 → 3569.68] Well, in fairness, in fairness, they did kind of continue spiritually the program with Proton.
[3570.22 → 3575.72] And that's like kind of big deal in terms of Windows game compatibility on Linux now.
[3576.38 → 3578.18] But I don't know.
[3578.24 → 3580.28] I just it's like it's like Google, right?
[3580.28 → 3584.68] It's like signing up for their new chat app or music service.
[3584.86 → 3585.38] I don't know.
[3585.46 → 3586.46] Can I commit to this?
[3586.52 → 3589.60] Do I really want to do I really want to integrate this in my life?
[3589.68 → 3591.02] I'm not sure.
[3591.38 → 3595.52] Do I try to convert people in my life to this, etc.?
[3595.52 → 3598.82] You know what you really need to convert people in your life to?
[3599.48 → 3600.84] The value of meditation.
[3601.56 → 3602.76] Oh, Geez.
[3602.76 → 3605.88] Okay, so this is amazing.
[3606.16 → 3609.58] Amazon has never talked to a warehouse worker ever.
[3609.72 → 3610.76] And I guarantee it.
[3611.02 → 3611.76] Oh, my goodness.
[3611.84 → 3619.32] Amazon will install Zen booth meditation kiosks in warehouses.
[3620.32 → 3629.40] So this was actually this was actually a thing that Amazon actually announced as part of its
[3629.40 → 3631.42] working well program.
[3631.42 → 3636.98] And it is exactly what that picture I just showed you looked like.
[3637.10 → 3645.70] It is a phone booth in the middle of an Amazon warehouse where you go and close the door and cry.
[3646.44 → 3651.68] With a clear door or at least a partially clear door, so people can see that you're in there.
[3651.82 → 3655.80] So the claim is that it's to help employees de-stress.
[3655.80 → 3660.08] It is a mindful practice room, whatever that means.
[3660.08 → 3668.38] And inside, workers can use a screen to navigate through a library of mental health and mindful practices called Amazon.
[3669.18 → 3669.82] Amazon.
[3670.38 → 3673.10] In order to recharge their internal battery.
[3673.94 → 3675.18] I like that.
[3675.18 → 3681.14] I like that recharging internal batteries is the way that we kind of can think of Amazon's warehouse workers.
[3681.50 → 3682.90] Apparently, they're machines.
[3683.04 → 3684.40] They need their batteries recharged.
[3684.40 → 3689.96] The booths are equipped with plants, pamphlets, a fan and tinted blue light.
[3690.66 → 3694.84] Not too much of it, though, because, again, it's about the size of a phone booth.
[3695.30 → 3696.52] Yeah, not too many plants.
[3697.00 → 3697.16] Yeah.
[3697.16 → 3705.68] So I would like to look up this Lila Brown, who apparently came up with this.
[3707.26 → 3708.22] I just know.
[3708.52 → 3708.84] I love LinkedIn.
[3708.84 → 3710.86] So I haven't worked in.
[3710.96 → 3713.28] Oh, no, I technically worked in a warehouse.
[3714.02 → 3714.42] Yeah.
[3714.86 → 3719.98] I worked at a factory that had a small storage thing on the side.
[3720.06 → 3726.40] And I worked in the storage of stuff that the factory made and distribution onto trucks and stuff like that.
[3726.48 → 3727.80] So kind of the same.
[3729.54 → 3730.62] At least related.
[3730.62 → 3738.00] And I know from having worked there and knowing the people that worked there, this is not what people want.
[3738.78 → 3742.28] Probably, you know, better pay, better working conditions.
[3743.52 → 3745.40] That's probably more what they want.
[3746.00 → 3746.38] Yeah.
[3747.06 → 3747.92] Just saying.
[3748.72 → 3751.28] So I love creeping people on LinkedIn.
[3751.46 → 3752.90] It's always, always fascinating.
[3752.90 → 3764.16] So I got a background in injury prevention, apparently the lady who came up with this, athletic trainer at some point in the past.
[3765.60 → 3766.40] Yeah.
[3766.48 → 3772.16] Mostly experienced as an athletic trainer and injury prevention specialist at Amazon.
[3772.16 → 3791.86] So as you expected, literally zero experience working in a warehouse, which is definitely a qualification that I would say Amazon should consider for someone who is creating programs to improve the morale of the workers in their warehouses.
[3794.44 → 3799.32] There's been some criticism of the Amazon booth.
[3799.32 → 3806.82] User Talia Latin said, I feel like liable wages and working conditions are better than a mobile despair closet.
[3807.60 → 3811.98] Alex Press says a portable toilet might have actually been more useful.
[3812.94 → 3813.12] Yeah.
[3813.26 → 3814.06] Got them.
[3814.86 → 3819.58] It's not clear when Amazon workers would even be able to use the booths.
[3819.58 → 3829.10] Workers recently sued the company for failing to schedule legally required 30-minute breaks, then forcing employees to monitor their walkie-talkies if any problems arose.
[3829.32 → 3836.44] And employees also complained about chronically understaffed shifts that left them unable to take 10-minute rest breaks.
[3836.94 → 3846.88] It's ironic how people in a warehouse make next to nothing and are expected to run, run, run, run, run, run, run like machines.
[3846.88 → 3851.00] And people who work at a desk whose job is to think.
[3851.00 → 3855.40] Like I can tell you as someone whose job it is essentially to think.
[3856.50 → 3861.38] I don't work continuously for eight hours at my shift.
[3861.38 → 3864.92] Like it doesn't it doesn't work that way.
[3865.00 → 3867.84] It tends to be a little bit burst.
[3867.84 → 3870.16] Like I'll have a'll have a go, go, go time.
[3870.32 → 3878.52] You know, we'll have a rush where, OK, I got a review a script with Anthony for this, you know, pre briefing we got on an event.
[3878.52 → 3882.48] And then while that's being set up to shoot, I need to go shoot a short circuit.
[3882.48 → 3885.46] Then I need to go straight to Anthony's thing and I need to shoot that.
[3885.72 → 3889.72] And then when I'm done, I need to have a quick meeting with James about what happened there.
[3890.08 → 3891.04] And then.
[3892.46 → 3898.70] Honestly, guys, I'm a take like 15 minutes, 10 minutes and brain break.
[3899.30 → 3902.04] You know, I'm going to water around a little bit.
[3902.10 → 3902.70] I'll do some.
[3902.88 → 3904.70] Well, usually I'm moving a lot of work, actually.
[3904.70 → 3908.64] I take a lot of steps, OK, like desk workers, move around a little bit.
[3909.12 → 3928.24] But like something that I might do is something that's only kind of work, you know, like I'll, I'll go, and I'll have a look at some Twitter mentions, or I'll check sentiment on today's video upload, or I'll, you know, reply to some not very urgent emails that don't require a lot of thought because the human body is not designed to go full bore all the time.
[3928.24 → 3931.18] It's if you think it is, then, you know what?
[3931.22 → 3932.02] Good for you.
[3932.16 → 3935.66] Enjoy being an amazing Superman or Superwoman or whatever.
[3936.16 → 3938.00] But most of us can't do it.
[3938.30 → 3940.66] So I think it's just I don't know.
[3940.68 → 3942.20] It's just it's just madness.
[3942.20 → 3944.14] The kind of expectations.
[3944.14 → 3945.84] I think the pandemic has taught us a lot.
[3945.88 → 3946.06] Right.
[3946.10 → 3950.22] On the one hand, you know, we've got these essential workers.
[3950.22 → 3959.56] But on the other hand, there's this sort of confusion that they don't want to come back to work for, you know, twelve dollars an hour or less.
[3959.82 → 3960.14] What?
[3960.84 → 3962.90] It's like, sorry, you told us we were essential.
[3963.72 → 3964.94] You told us we were essential.
[3965.12 → 3966.94] So, like, now what?
[3967.12 → 3968.10] Now what's up?
[3968.64 → 3969.86] I mean, have you seen those signs?
[3969.86 → 3971.96] Essentially not worth very much to the company, nerd.
[3972.24 → 3973.30] Way to get underpaid.
[3973.30 → 3977.54] Have you seen those signs, those like salty signs on like fast food restaurants and stuff?
[3977.76 → 3979.36] No one wants to work anymore.
[3979.36 → 3980.62] No one wants to work anymore.
[3980.76 → 3987.42] It's like, no, no one wants to work for what is the equivalent of way below minimum wage 30, 40 years ago.
[3988.02 → 3989.48] That's what no one wants to work for.
[3989.54 → 3990.98] Anyway, that's a whole separate conversation.
[3991.78 → 3995.44] 16 gig RAM iPads underperforming something, something.
[3995.60 → 4000.44] Apparently there's still some optimization that needs to be done in iPadOS to make sure that they can make full use of their RAM.
[4000.98 → 4001.34] Okay.
[4002.24 → 4004.68] And I guess that's pretty much it for the show.
[4005.10 → 4009.34] Other than I should probably go through some super chats.
[4009.36 → 4011.86] All right.
[4012.92 → 4015.32] Lori O asks, LTT laptop bag?
[4017.76 → 4020.14] Robert Mail says, there's no non-boring topics?
[4020.64 → 4022.38] The Index 2 is getting freaking laser beams.
[4022.48 → 4022.64] Okay.
[4022.72 → 4024.10] Yeah, that's rumoured.
[4024.24 → 4025.28] We don't know that for sure.
[4025.40 → 4028.40] But it does look like the Index 2 will be moving to inside-out tracking.
[4028.40 → 4034.42] So maybe I won't have to worry so much about base station mounting points and power in the ceiling at my new house.
[4034.58 → 4035.74] So that's neat.
[4035.90 → 4038.84] Except that I will have to because I'm using an Index 1.
[4039.26 → 4042.74] So I guess I have to worry about how to do that and then how to patch holes.
[4042.74 → 4051.20] That Period says, as someone who works for Amazon, I can say the company is definitely very out of touch.
[4051.54 → 4054.04] Just thought you should know your feelings are justified.
[4054.56 → 4055.98] Have some of Amazon's money.
[4057.24 → 4059.86] I kind of feel bad taking it from you, to be perfectly honest.
[4060.42 → 4060.64] Yeah.
[4060.64 → 4063.68] The Rolling Hat says, how are the 12K cameras going?
[4063.86 → 4065.74] Did they end up being worth switching from the 8K Red?
[4065.84 → 4067.16] So, oh, it's complicated.
[4067.46 → 4068.90] Oh, Lord, is it ever complicated.
[4069.02 → 4075.06] They have issues with recording over USB, which we shouldn't have found that surprising, but it's still pretty frustrating.
[4077.68 → 4082.74] They are not really higher resolution than Red's 8K image.
[4082.74 → 4085.40] Not really, because there's more noise in them.
[4086.64 → 4089.50] The yeah, I don't know.
[4089.50 → 4091.18] They're okay.
[4091.32 → 4092.60] We're exploring other options.
[4092.76 → 4095.30] We're actually looking, maybe going back to Sony.
[4095.42 → 4095.68] What is it?
[4095.68 → 4096.90] The FX6, I think?
[4097.02 → 4097.42] FX3?
[4097.50 → 4097.98] I can't remember.
[4098.32 → 4098.62] Really?
[4100.16 → 4104.72] Skin says, LMG focuses on high-res content, but you upload in 30 FPS.
[4105.66 → 4109.06] It usually doesn't matter, but the office tour is noticeable with all the extra camera movement.
[4109.14 → 4110.80] Why stay at 30 and not 50 or 60?
[4110.80 → 4114.50] The reason is that my camera department would mutiny.
[4114.50 → 4122.20] They don't want to shoot 60 FPS content, and if I force them, I legitimately think one or more of them would quit.
[4125.20 → 4125.84] I'm sorry.
[4125.94 → 4126.62] It is what it is.
[4127.20 → 4129.90] Alder says, lockdown should end soon with vaccines.
[4130.06 → 4131.58] Scrapyard war, when and where?
[4131.58 → 4134.90] I don't know if we'll ever do another Scrapyard Wars, to be honest with you.
[4135.36 → 4135.50] Yeah.
[4135.62 → 4146.26] We've kind of seen that through to a certain degree, and honestly, one, I think it's kind of been seen through, and two, the environment right now is just terrible.
[4146.26 → 4150.56] I think Scrapyard Wars accomplished its goal, to be honest.
[4150.84 → 4162.30] The goal that Scrapyard Wars had when we first did it was to encourage people to not just buy new things, to spend a little bit of effort, check the used market, and potentially save a huge amount of money.
[4162.42 → 4163.44] Learn about computers.
[4164.14 → 4164.44] Yes.
[4164.70 → 4166.00] Be an informed consumer.
[4166.16 → 4168.84] Informed consumers don't always buy the newest, shiniest object.
[4169.60 → 4169.78] Yeah.
[4170.12 → 4173.76] And honestly, I think that's quite ingrained in the culture now.
[4173.76 → 4176.08] And I think a lot of that came from Scrapyard Wars.
[4176.28 → 4178.12] I think we can be very happy about that.
[4178.20 → 4178.32] Yep.
[4178.86 → 4180.00] We also...
[4180.00 → 4180.98] It's been a bit exhausted.
[4181.44 → 4181.60] Yeah.
[4181.66 → 4186.82] We also, I think, showed that you can be a PC gamer for a few hundred dollars.
[4187.20 → 4198.90] There was a perception not that long ago that PC gaming, Master Race, whatever, had this barrier to entry where if you didn't have $1,000 to spend, there was sort of this elitist.
[4198.90 → 4204.36] And there was a community of the there was a part of the PC community that unironically felt this way.
[4206.36 → 4208.52] And I think we kind of dispelled that.
[4208.60 → 4213.64] We kind of went, no, you don't have to have $1,000 to, and run at the highest resolution to be a PC gamer.
[4214.08 → 4221.28] And, I mean, curiously, you can still run at the highest resolutions, which we showed, and not spend $1,000.
[4221.28 → 4224.96] And I don't know.
[4225.02 → 4226.20] I think that was a perfect thing.
[4226.34 → 4227.16] It's, yeah, it's funny.
[4227.24 → 4227.82] I was reading it.
[4227.86 → 4237.26] I was reading a spectacularly stupid tweet today where someone was like, oh, yeah, that Linus guy, you mean the one that doesn't think there's any problem with the term PC Master Race?
[4237.34 → 4244.20] And it's like, you clearly just have no idea what that term means or ever meant.
[4244.58 → 4246.08] It's ironic.
[4246.46 → 4247.28] We are...
[4247.28 → 4248.24] It's a self-joke.
[4248.36 → 4249.06] It's a self-roll.
[4249.06 → 4250.24] We're taking the piss.
[4250.36 → 4256.54] We're not actually supporting, you know, eugenics or, you know, whatever it is that you think it's about.
[4256.80 → 4259.12] It's about making fun of it.
[4259.58 → 4263.06] The PC Master Race is a satirical term.
[4264.08 → 4272.04] And even the Subreddit that is now probably the most kind of famous community of people who fly willingly under that banner,
[4272.14 → 4276.70] even the Subreddit is very clear that you don't have to even have a computer.
[4276.70 → 4279.84] You just have to love PC gaming.
[4279.96 → 4281.92] It's not about being exclusionary.
[4282.06 → 4283.22] It's about being inclusive.
[4284.00 → 4284.98] So you've clearly misunderstood...
[4284.98 → 4286.14] It's a little weird, but yeah.
[4286.24 → 4287.00] You've misunderstood.
[4287.34 → 4291.12] You're getting hung up on the words, and you're misunderstanding the meaning.
[4291.46 → 4295.02] The original meaning was to make fun of PC snobs.
[4295.02 → 4306.36] And then PC snobs co-opted it and also did some introspection and kind of went, oh, yeah, there's no reason to be snobby about this.
[4306.76 → 4307.80] Everyone should be welcome.
[4308.14 → 4313.60] And now, no, I don't see a problem with the term because words are what they mean.
[4314.06 → 4314.94] And that's what it means.
[4314.94 → 4319.24] And if you choose to put your fingers in your ears and go, la, la, la, la, la, it doesn't mean that.
[4319.28 → 4319.72] It doesn't mean that.
[4319.74 → 4320.56] It means what I want it to mean.
[4321.38 → 4322.04] Well, that's on you.
[4322.36 → 4324.20] I can't do anything about that.
[4324.64 → 4325.98] So go be mad, right?
[4326.68 → 4327.32] What do you want from me?
[4327.88 → 4333.48] So to quickly summarize the Scrappy Art Wars thing, it was like one of my favourite things ever as well.
[4333.90 → 4335.54] But I think it's kind of ran its course.
[4335.80 → 4336.38] Kind of sad.
[4336.38 → 4338.38] But the old episodes are always there.
[4338.82 → 4345.82] And I think LTT will find new and inventive ways to get across those messages when they deem fit.
[4346.26 → 4351.90] I think the used market is not wanting or needing that right now anyway.
[4351.92 → 4352.54] Yeah, no kidding.
[4353.16 → 4354.16] Not even remotely.
[4354.74 → 4358.38] So I think there's, yeah, yeah, that's about it.
[4359.58 → 4360.44] All right.
[4362.36 → 4365.44] Let's go ahead and see if there's anything else in here.
[4366.38 → 4373.42] Tyler B says, is there any way we could easily secure our personal data most of the time without changing our daily lives too much?
[4373.44 → 4379.70] We've actually been thinking of doing like a DE-Google-ify your life or like a DE-cloud-ify your life kind of video.
[4379.82 → 4383.30] The problem is that that type of content really doesn't perform well for us.
[4383.94 → 4388.52] So it's the kind of thing that when the channel is doing well, we'll do it anyway and just kind of eat it.
[4389.70 → 4393.16] But yes, it is something that we're planning to do, but probably not for the time being.
[4394.02 → 4395.58] Dom says, love my keyboard shirt.
[4395.58 → 4397.48] Got one of each colour, even the limited edition one.
[4397.56 → 4398.12] Very nice.
[4398.54 → 4401.88] But my daughter who has green keycaps wants a green version.
[4402.52 → 4402.96] You know what?
[4403.00 → 4407.02] The keyboard shirt hasn't been one of our most successful products.
[4407.22 → 4411.86] So I can't promise that you will see any more versions of that.
[4413.86 → 4416.12] It's Man says, have you seen Discord's rebranding?
[4416.24 → 4416.52] Yes.
[4417.06 → 4417.66] It's all right.
[4417.90 → 4418.28] I don't know.
[4418.28 → 4420.82] I don't really think it looks better personally.
[4421.00 → 4421.86] I don't think it looks worse.
[4421.92 → 4423.14] I just don't really care.
[4423.70 → 4424.50] I don't care anymore.
[4424.74 → 4424.92] Yeah.
[4426.02 → 4427.82] Nathan asks, would you ever have a French channel?
[4428.22 → 4433.96] I wouldn't have a French channel, but I don't think it's really in the works right now.
[4434.92 → 4437.34] Phantom says, I do anal sees.
[4438.18 → 4438.58] All right.
[4438.58 → 4440.38] I think you might have mistyped that.
[4441.16 → 4443.30] But okay.
[4443.62 → 4445.80] Oh, Tyler B says, show us the burn, please.
[4447.46 → 4449.00] That's not the easiest thing to do.
[4449.48 → 4454.56] Also, while they have been chatting, they were supposed to be asleep from the show.
[4454.74 → 4455.56] So they wouldn't be too loud.
[4455.70 → 4457.88] But I will maybe work on it.
[4457.98 → 4458.10] Yeah.
[4458.20 → 4458.54] Give me a sec.
[4458.54 → 4458.74] Sure.
[4459.24 → 4463.42] Random Noise says, hey, guys, I'm sorry that's off-topic, but I'd like to suggest a request to build.
[4463.52 → 4464.18] I'm a truck driver.
[4464.18 → 4467.28] I want to build a computer that's easy to move around with no compromises.
[4467.46 → 4468.50] I really don't like laptops.
[4470.12 → 4470.52] Yeah.
[4470.62 → 4473.16] I mean, we've done some really compact builds lately.
[4473.32 → 4475.28] You should probably check those out.
[4475.80 → 4478.48] Otherwise, like a super portable build.
[4478.58 → 4481.76] We've been considering doing like the divorced parents PC for a while.
[4482.50 → 4488.36] And so the idea would be that it includes a really portable PC and also peripherals.
[4488.64 → 4494.16] I think it's still on the agenda, but it's just something that's been kind of kicked down the road a handful of times for more.
[4494.18 → 4495.60] More time sensitive projects.
[4496.60 → 4499.88] Phantom says, I have severe industrial grade unstoppable diarrhea.
[4500.08 → 4506.30] I wouldn't normally have read that, but Phantom sent a hundred New Zealand dollars, whatever that is, for me to read it.
[4506.38 → 4507.62] So I guess here we are.
[4508.28 → 4512.10] Sent using Starlink from my Sunseeker 155 yacht.
[4512.56 → 4512.92] Okay.
[4513.56 → 4514.82] Hey, it's Burn.
[4516.10 → 4517.02] Burn, Burn, Burn.
[4517.02 → 4523.24] I had like a blanket cover on them and I just lifted it off, and then I shoved this camera in their face.
[4523.36 → 4524.80] So I think they're just like, wait, what?
[4525.16 → 4531.08] But you can see the green one, also known as Wally, like Wally from the movie.
[4531.08 → 4537.30] He has one foot up, meaning he's very comfortable, and he's doing some little beat grinding, which also means he's very comfortable.
[4538.38 → 4542.86] And the other one, the one in the back named Scoop, that's where he often sleeps.
[4543.08 → 4544.02] So he's just kind of chilling.
[4544.30 → 4546.60] He was relaxed, just hanging out under the blanket.
[4546.80 → 4547.58] They were sleeping during the show.
[4547.94 → 4548.06] Yeah.
[4548.06 → 4553.34] So PMD says Scrapyard Wars, but all parts must be pre-2010.
[4555.34 → 4557.86] Just going to play us, play some classic games, right?
[4559.58 → 4562.78] Uh, Opera says AMC ME YOLO update.
[4563.06 → 4565.02] Um, I mean, there's not much of an update.
[4565.12 → 4567.36] I tweeted yesterday and still holding.
[4567.58 → 4568.92] It's not a very good idea.
[4569.52 → 4575.78] Um, you know, I wouldn't recommend it, but technically get this, Luke.
[4575.78 → 4578.04] Luke, I am, I am up.
[4578.62 → 4578.88] Yeah.
[4581.34 → 4584.10] I heard there's been an AMC rally or something.
[4584.24 → 4585.64] I'm not following it closely enough.
[4585.64 → 4585.66] Yeah.
[4585.66 → 4592.64] AMC is like double what I paid for it, um, which is the dumbest thing ever.
[4592.80 → 4593.56] Is that the moon?
[4593.90 → 4594.78] I don't know anything.
[4595.04 → 4596.84] I just like movies, you know?
[4597.50 → 4599.00] Um, I just like movies.
[4599.44 → 4599.78] Yeah.
[4600.00 → 4601.78] I just, I just like the stock.
[4601.86 → 4602.82] I just like movies.
[4602.82 → 4608.08] Uh, I, I wouldn't recommend getting into this at all.
[4608.34 → 4611.44] Guys, uh, ME is down 13% today.
[4611.56 → 4615.36] AMC is actually down today, but it rallied so much over the last little bit that it's
[4615.36 → 4616.24] like, yeah.
[4616.30 → 4622.84] So on the original 50 grand into ME, AMC and BCRX, which were all Wall Street bets
[4622.84 → 4624.50] stocks that I was like, here we go.
[4624.56 → 4625.34] Wealth redistribution.
[4625.48 → 4627.56] I'm actually up seven grand.
[4627.56 → 4633.04] Um, so it's been redistributed to me now, but you only make money if you sell.
[4633.04 → 4639.36] So since I'm a smooth brained ape and I have diamond hands, I guess I haven't made any money,
[4639.76 → 4644.38] but that also means I never lost any money, even when the portfolio was worth half of what
[4644.38 → 4644.74] I paid.
[4645.74 → 4646.22] Mm-hmm.
[4647.06 → 4648.46] So we'll see how that goes.
[4648.46 → 4652.12] I, I'm not even paying attention to it anymore, to be perfectly honest with you guys.
[4652.12 → 4654.54] It's just, it's, it's there.
[4655.06 → 4661.74] Um, like I said before, to me, this is more about, uh, just redistribution of wealth.
[4662.12 → 4665.50] Um, someone who needs it more than me is going to end up with it.
[4665.76 → 4667.24] That's, that's what I expect to happen.
[4667.48 → 4671.26] I think I probably am not going to do any more updates on it.
[4671.28 → 4672.88] I think it's just not really necessary.
[4672.88 → 4676.26] I think to the vast majority of the audience, it's not that interesting.
[4676.26 → 4683.00] And that, uh, yeah, that, that crowd can, can keep doing their whole thing.
[4683.68 → 4687.48] Float plane chats, just like line to sell, just sell it, just sell it.
[4688.28 → 4689.02] I don't know.
[4689.16 → 4689.66] I don't know.
[4689.84 → 4690.28] I don't know.
[4690.52 → 4690.94] I don't know.
[4691.34 → 4694.10] DJ spark says I'm doing quite well on the Corsair IP.
[4694.24 → 4694.98] Oh, that's interesting.
[4695.80 → 4696.86] Oh, sorry.
[4696.88 → 4698.00] That's not what I meant to do.
[4698.48 → 4700.86] Um, okay.
[4700.94 → 4701.18] Yeah.
[4701.18 → 4704.96] I guess they went up at like 15, and they're worth like 30 now.
[4705.04 → 4705.22] Yeah.
[4705.22 → 4705.46] Okay.
[4705.46 → 4705.74] Yeah.
[4705.74 → 4706.28] I can see that.
[4706.56 → 4709.40] I wasn't, I mean, I was really uncertain at the time.
[4709.40 → 4711.42] I told you guys, I was like, ah, I don't know.
[4711.44 → 4712.08] I don't really get it.
[4712.12 → 4715.88] They're already number one or number two in basically every space they participate in.
[4716.08 → 4719.88] And so I see them continuing to be a very profitable company, but a lot of the time,
[4719.88 → 4721.28] that's not the way stocks work.
[4721.50 → 4726.66] Just like being a high functioning, profitable company doesn't seem to be enough.
[4726.94 → 4728.64] You have to, you have to be growing.
[4728.64 → 4731.62] Uh, so yeah, I don't know.
[4732.58 → 4733.16] All right.
[4733.24 → 4736.80] Well, I think that's pretty much it for the WAN show for today.
[4736.96 → 4738.78] Thank you guys so much for tuning in.
[4738.90 → 4739.94] We will see you again next week.
[4740.22 → 4741.24] Same bad time.
[4741.34 → 4742.24] Same bad channel.
[4742.30 → 4742.88] Oh, no.
[4742.94 → 4743.66] I have one more thing.
[4743.96 → 4744.30] Hey, Luke.
[4744.74 → 4745.48] Uh, David.
[4745.48 → 4749.16] Did I ever tell you David figured after a week he could beat me in Beat Safer?
[4750.04 → 4750.44] Yeah.
[4750.44 → 4751.26] I've never played it before.
[4751.78 → 4752.48] It's official.
[4752.52 → 4752.98] When is it?
[4753.16 → 4757.04] He and I are going to be streaming, uh, hopefully, hopefully.
[4757.16 → 4760.24] The plan is for, uh, he and I to stream on Sunday night.
[4760.94 → 4765.34] And this will be his, his initial, like, experience in Beat Safer.
[4765.80 → 4769.00] Um, so obviously it's going to be a like, a show.
[4769.58 → 4770.86] Um, and then.
[4770.86 → 4772.02] So this is his day one.
[4772.18 → 4772.30] Yeah.
[4772.30 → 4774.96] So you're going to compete with him on day one, and then you're going to see the improvement
[4774.96 → 4775.98] over on day seven.
[4776.58 → 4776.78] Yeah.
[4776.80 → 4777.06] Okay.
[4777.26 → 4779.62] So we'll see if he can, if he can beat me on day seven.
[4780.68 → 4786.30] He says that he is like a rock band God in his words.
[4786.34 → 4788.26] He's very, uh, modest about it.
[4788.34 → 4791.62] So he says he's a rock band God and that he is amazing at rhythm games.
[4791.62 → 4792.72] Yeah, I was perfect at rock band too.
[4792.94 → 4797.24] Those, uh, those, that's not the that's not the skill transfer that I think you'd think
[4797.24 → 4797.88] it is, but.
[4798.16 → 4801.74] Um, he apparently was a drummer for like 15 years though.
[4801.74 → 4803.84] I could see that being somewhat applicable.
[4803.84 → 4805.28] Like real, like real life.
[4805.86 → 4806.46] Um, yeah.
[4806.70 → 4807.02] Yep.
[4807.20 → 4808.38] So very, very musical.
[4809.06 → 4810.70] Um, grade 10 piano.
[4810.82 → 4812.92] He was listing all of his credentials for me today.
[4813.38 → 4817.34] Um, while he talked about how he was going to wreck me.
[4817.82 → 4819.44] Um, he's much stronger than me.
[4819.44 → 4824.74] So in terms of like, like just arm strength, like going back and forth and stuff, you know,
[4824.74 → 4826.50] he's probably got an endurance advantage.
[4826.50 → 4833.62] Um, but what's not the same thing, but what's hard for, I think people who haven't really
[4833.62 → 4837.72] played to understand is that none of those things are going to matter.
[4837.96 → 4838.48] Yeah.
[4838.98 → 4841.08] Because it's all about form.
[4841.08 → 4847.64] Um, and conveniently the sport that I play, which is not rock band, um, is, which is badminton,
[4847.64 → 4855.60] uh, has a very similar stroke and has a very similar accuracy tolerance to beat safer.
[4855.72 → 4857.22] That's why I picked it up really quickly.
[4857.22 → 4864.92] I suspect he is going to get into it and realize that he can hit the boxes, but that his swings
[4864.92 → 4869.66] are not accurate enough to get any kind of decent score.
[4869.76 → 4870.16] So we'll see.
[4870.66 → 4870.88] We'll see.
[4870.94 → 4871.50] I could be wrong.
[4871.66 → 4871.78] Yeah.
[4871.94 → 4872.78] He could crush me.
[4873.12 → 4877.28] And then I would be really embarrassed about coming out and talking smack on the WAN show
[4877.28 → 4877.80] like this.
[4878.26 → 4882.38] But, uh, yeah, he's a surprise with a Z and I don't know.
[4882.40 → 4883.40] There's an I think there's an underscore.
[4883.40 → 4884.96] There's an underscore is the U.
[4885.10 → 4887.04] He needs a new, he needs a new handle.
[4887.22 → 4888.64] Um, a little complicated.
[4888.80 → 4889.74] He's surprised on Twitch.
[4889.74 → 4893.36] And then I'll probably be on the Linus tech Twitch account Sunday night.
[4893.44 → 4893.94] That's the plan.
[4894.02 → 4894.76] So we'll see how it goes.
[4895.50 → 4896.30] That's exciting.
[4896.60 → 4898.08] That's genuinely quite exciting.
[4898.26 → 4901.96] Apparently Mark Zuckerberg uploaded a video of him playing beat safer, beat him instead.
[4902.18 → 4903.94] I'm, I'm pretty sure I could handle him.
[4904.04 → 4904.90] I'm pretty sure I could take him.
[4904.92 → 4905.04] Yeah.
[4905.86 → 4906.24] All right.
[4906.80 → 4907.82] Later guys.
[4909.44 → 4909.84] Bye.
[4917.22 → 4923.76] Blue sky wants us to play star citizen again.
[4923.86 → 4924.88] That was so much fun.
[4927.08 → 4930.32] I wasn't able to join him last time, but Riley actually played it recently.
[4930.44 → 4931.00] Yeah.
[4931.00 → 4931.32] Yeah.
[4931.32 → 4932.98] Yeah.
[4932.98 → 4933.08] Yeah.
[4933.08 → 4933.12] Yeah.
[4933.12 → 4933.20] Yeah.
[4933.20 → 4933.48] Yeah.
[4933.48 → 4933.62] Yeah.
[4933.62 → 4935.28] Yeah.
[4935.28 → 4935.44] Yeah.
[4935.44 → 4935.54] Yeah.
[4935.54 → 4935.64] Yeah.
[4935.64 → 4936.76] Yeah.
[4936.76 → 4937.26] Yeah.
[4937.26 → 4937.88] Yeah.
[4937.88 → 4938.86] Yeah.
[4938.86 → 4939.62] Yeah.
[4939.62 → 4940.00] Yeah.
[4940.00 → 4940.22] Yeah.
[4940.22 → 4940.80] Yeah.
[4940.80 → 4941.32] Yeah.
[4941.32 → 4942.00] Yeah.
[4942.00 → 4942.90] Yeah.
[4942.90 → 4944.16] Yeah.
[4944.16 → 4944.96] Yeah.
[4944.96 → 4946.20] Yeah.
