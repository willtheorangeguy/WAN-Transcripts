[0.00 → 9.54] and we're live welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen got a fantastic show lined up for you
[9.54 → 17.00] today uh this is going to be the uh this is kind of the hobbit um approach to WAN show because we
[17.00 → 21.46] kind of had uh we had WAN show and then now I guess we're having second WAN show yeah well you
[21.46 → 26.92] are I'm having second WAN show, but we didn't actually really talk about a ton of tech news
[26.92 → 31.46] or what's going on in the tech community on the last show then again half the time we don't
[31.46 → 38.24] talk about that on regular WAN show either okay the point is gamers nexus bought what I guess is
[38.24 → 45.38] there is called a scam pre-built from burrower with a 10-year-old GPU in it so we're going to be
[45.38 → 52.94] talking a little bit about that um Microsoft and Qualcomm seem to be determined to make each other's
[52.94 → 58.04] platforms less appealing so we're going to kind of jump into that a little bit later what else we
[58.04 → 66.82] got here today it's official the pc is the ultimate hardware of all time for gaming for game for gaming
[66.82 → 73.54] sure yeah nice also tesla is going to use footage that records of you
[73.54 → 79.62] that records of what the road it records of you there's a new update to tesla's full self-driving
[79.62 → 84.40] driver's assistance program, and it's an agreement uh to accept a tesla can use footage from both
[84.40 → 90.50] outside and inside the vehicle brilliant who could have seen this coming let's go ahead and roll that
[90.50 → 90.94] intro
[90.94 → 120.10] and the show today is brought to you by humid secret lab and ridge wallet all right ladies and
[120.10 → 127.18] gentlemen obviously we're going to have to jump right into our first topic of the day pc gamer has
[127.18 → 135.16] reported on this surprise games radar has support reported on this um the winner of the 2021
[135.16 → 147.00] golden joystick award for the best hold on where is it best gaming hardware okay is the pc, so there was
[147.00 → 155.38] some uh there were some uh there were some uh some nominees okay PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X Xbox series
[155.38 → 165.88] s NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 um Nintendo Switch OLED WD black sn850 NVMe SSD, so this was the best gaming hardware
[165.88 → 172.98] 2021 shortlist and then there was ultimate hardware of all time to celebrate 50 years of gaming and
[172.98 → 185.92] ultimate game of all time, so the ultimate hardware of all time is the pc um which as much as I'm
[185.92 → 194.38] you know as obviously a lover of the pc gaming platform as much as i you know I get it the best
[194.38 → 202.72] individual plant of all time is trees yeah uh it feels just kind of like a puff award
[202.72 → 208.00] yeah I okay you know what hot take that's really stupid
[208.00 → 216.04] they should have I kind of hate it they would have actually platform or something
[216.04 → 222.20] yeah it would have had to be platform because to say the ultimate hardware of all time you really
[222.20 → 229.18] do have to pick a piece of hardware because that means if you're going to say the pc is the ultimate
[229.18 → 237.58] hardware of all time then the pc has to go up against console yeah right, and you could make the argument
[237.58 → 247.20] that in the early days um home consoles in a way were more revolutionary for gaming acceptance by the
[247.20 → 256.30] mainstream than pc gaming was absolutely I mean the Nintendo entertainment system was such a way such
[256.30 → 262.82] a move towards the mainstream the way the game boy like portable gaming ladies and gentlemen the way
[262.82 → 267.66] kind of brought it back because it was declining there for a while yeah and Nintendo
[267.66 → 273.70] even had oh is it far away Nintendo even had like the game and watch and stuff like that before
[273.70 → 279.28] the game boy my gaming watch was pre-game boy right like this is all before kind of my time i my
[279.28 → 284.64] family I didn't have a game boy like that was not yeah gaming watch is before that though yeah that
[284.64 → 292.06] was uh that was uh uh uh an optional purchase that was not going to happen in my family yeah but um
[292.06 → 301.62] like to put pc up against console is kind of already kind of silly but to consider and how do you define
[301.62 → 307.22] ultimate too i i I don't know it's like yeah you can do more with a computer there 's's kind of a
[307.22 → 314.28] reason why there's more computer-based twitch stream gamers sure are console ones yeah but like does that
[314.28 → 321.92] platform does that make it more ultimate I don't know I don't I don't know that's a really tough um
[321.92 → 328.16] that's a really tough sort of question to answer like you know i might say okay you know what
[328.16 → 336.84] about the uh what about the first GPU with um with like hardware TNL or something like that uh
[336.84 → 342.34] oh you know what about this is actually hilarious sorry I'm going to throw this in there uh Gabe
[342.34 → 346.80] Newell accepted the award on behalf of personal computers uh and there's a note here that I don't
[346.80 → 351.80] know who wrote this but absolutely uh I agree with them strongly they say and who better to accept
[351.80 → 359.12] the hardware award than a man who's famous for developing software I like this is the whole
[359.12 → 363.82] problem Gabe Newell's fantastic he's done amazing things for game he's done amazing things for the
[363.82 → 367.42] gaming community the pc gaming community absolutely steam deck looks super cool yeah but let's not
[367.42 → 372.34] pretend it's purely altruistic oh not at all okay cool just making sure we're on the same page
[372.34 → 379.98] and and and it's not it's not, but he has nothing to do with gaming hardware no like I would have been
[379.98 → 384.76] I would have been far more modern days a little bit more but like yeah I would have been I would
[384.76 → 390.86] have been I would have thought it far more uh fitting if someone like Jensen was up there accepting it
[390.86 → 399.90] um you know not that he likes talking about that wouldn't be my favourite one anymore but okay but it
[399.90 → 405.56] would have been more on the nose for sure the point is that you want to talk about gaming hardware
[405.56 → 414.30] yes yeah like he's been involved for sure since the founding of NVIDIA who is the only OG you know
[414.30 → 423.34] graphics accelerator company left still around yeah so like lets you know ATI purchased, and he's been
[423.34 → 429.12] there since day zero of NVIDIA so if you're going to talk about I just don't like it because it's very
[429.12 → 435.94] current branded if that makes sense i I mean I don't like it for a variety of reasons but if you
[435.94 → 441.86] want to talk about someone who would be appropriate to accept an award on behalf of the pc gaming
[441.86 → 447.62] platform I think i I can't think of a better fit gaming hardware specifically gaming hardware so the
[447.62 → 453.12] whole problem is that it's not called platform right because he's also pushing software
[453.12 → 459.94] pretty hard now with yeah yeah uh GeForce now and stuff like that okay actually GeForce now is a
[459.94 → 466.38] very hardware heavy thing you just sell it as a software anyway it's its literally we're not
[466.38 → 471.68] going to sell you the hardware it's a yeah it's avoiding gaming its hardware as a software service
[471.68 → 478.90] yeah so I don't know Luke I don't know man on the other hand we have the ultimate game of all time
[478.90 → 489.60] yeah so how do you choose an ultimate game that's tough that's tough there 's's a big part of me
[489.60 → 499.20] would jump to like category founders sure okay so you would go, and you would say okay legend of
[499.20 → 505.54] Zelda for ness as like sort of the first you could think of it as kind of like the first open world
[505.54 → 511.26] you know game I don't know if there's anything open world before that uh what is it called like
[511.26 → 519.22] dragon quest or something uh dragon age jumped into my mind, but that's not that sure as heck isn't it
[519.22 → 524.08] um dragon quest yeah I think it's called dragon quest
[524.08 → 532.84] throne throne I'm just guessing at this uh you guys will know what I'm talking about in a little bit
[532.84 → 540.12] the first dragon quest was 1986 okay the most recent dragon quest is to be released soon
[540.12 → 547.10] they've been making them forever dragon's lair uh OG doom Tetris OG doom honestly the first thing
[547.10 → 552.26] that jumped to my mind was OG doom but then I was a little bit like I don't know because I like fps's
[552.26 → 557.06] yeah and like I have to try to take my own personal preferences out of it so I'm not entirely sure but
[557.06 → 564.52] something like OG doom where it's like it is kind of creates a category yeah everything for a long
[564.52 → 568.56] time is based on if it is still referenced all those types of things I could see something that
[568.56 → 574.80] was like super culturally relevant like uh like a Pac-Man or something like that yeah because that
[574.80 → 579.24] was that was massive for gaming because that was like the whole arcade scene thing like yeah
[579.24 → 586.90] pong has some for obvious reasons pretty major first like home game uh like Tetris has some
[586.90 → 590.24] insane records behind it, i sure as heck wouldn't have picked dark souls
[590.24 → 598.86] now to be clear it has some pretty intense I'm not hating yeah okay I'm not hating and I'm
[598.86 → 604.58] speaking out of ignorance I have not played dark souls and maybe that should be my next game maybe i
[604.58 → 611.94] should play dark souls but I think that it's fair to say that dark souls didn't invent games being
[611.94 → 619.90] anything yeah and especially didn't invent games being hard dark souls is a throwback to games being
[619.90 → 626.84] hard it's not inventing the idea of games being hard it's far from the first roguelike it's far from
[626.84 → 632.64] the first difficult game and if anything previous eras of gaming are far better known for being
[632.64 → 639.12] infuriatingly difficult like there are arcade games if you're an if you're a modern gamer and you
[639.12 → 643.40] didn't play back then because i know what you're saying I know there's literally games that
[643.40 → 648.86] are effectively impossible to be no I know yeah um but if you're in if you're because you were saying
[648.86 → 654.88] well known for that well so if you're a modern gamer if there's a difficult game it is always
[654.88 → 660.52] compared to dark souls this is the dark souls of fps games this is the dark souls of something yeah
[660.52 → 666.62] like it is modern relevance it is extremely strong in modern relevance anytime anything is difficult
[666.62 → 674.64] I understand that but just because something is culturally relevant today does not mean of all
[674.64 → 680.72] time ultimate of all time ultimate of all time because you know I could make the argument again I have
[680.72 → 688.78] not played dark souls so fair enough but i I would personally make the argument that in terms of
[688.78 → 697.22] like that creating an immersive world is a far better art example of what can be the art
[697.22 → 704.34] of game creation, so something like a breath of the wild or a Skyrim or something like that would be
[704.34 → 710.80] very easily has a lot of claim arguably more important than this game that is known for being
[710.80 → 716.12] very difficult do you think it's I'm sort of stealing this from you, I'm sorry do you think it's possible
[716.12 → 722.22] that they could have had an answer that wouldn't have pissed off the majority of people no yeah so if
[722.22 → 729.00] you were gonna just if you were just going to use a random number generator anyway then just don't have
[729.00 → 735.68] the award yeah and i honestly if is I had to guess I would say it's because they just wanted to do
[735.68 → 740.22] something different they just wanted to say it's talking about it yeah they wanted to say something
[740.22 → 745.92] we wouldn't have talked about it if they'd picked Tetris or if they had picked this boring or unreal
[745.92 → 751.70] tournament or like or something like if they had picked because like you could make a solid
[751.70 → 758.38] argument for something like unreal tournament was a game changer for multiplayer
[758.38 → 763.14] online multiplayer so you want to so you want to talk about sort of moments in gaming right like
[763.14 → 770.32] pong is so important because it brought gaming into the house right Unreal Tournament brought gaming over
[770.32 → 776.18] the internet multiplayer yeah to the world like real tournament was the first time that I think in a
[776.18 → 783.82] in an average gamer's repertoire the hardware on the ISP level that was being provided to you was like
[783.82 → 788.90] common terminology used amongst friends that's that's probably the only time that has ever been
[788.90 → 794.78] a thing like people were talking about what their ISP was technologically capable of delivering to
[794.78 → 799.76] their house not what they were currently receiving yes like this was very intense ISDN baby
[799.76 → 805.30] people were yeah people were paying to have lines brought to their house which is not a huge thing a
[805.30 → 813.14] child okay at the time I paid I like I made a deal with my parents if they would pay the monthly
[813.14 → 820.22] subscription service because we had satellite TV we had no coax to our house if they would pay the
[820.22 → 827.16] monthly subscription I would pay out of my like allowance and money that I worked for to have the
[827.16 → 832.66] drop done to our house uh because it was like hundreds of dollars, and they were like well we don't care
[832.66 → 841.16] we'll use dial up forever and I was like no please no, no please no uh can is there any way that I can get
[841.16 → 848.20] faster internet, and they're like well we did get this quote I was like yes it was probably you know
[848.20 → 854.02] what's hilarious I never thought about it this way, but that was probably my first big ticket purchase
[854.02 → 862.62] yeah in my life was the cable drop for high speed internet that should tell you everything you need to
[862.62 → 871.58] know about me as a person man what do you think a percentage of your net worth at that time that was
[871.58 → 876.78] oh like almost all of it 100 yeah, yeah like I was like 12 13 or something like that like I didn't have
[876.78 → 884.62] money yeah um that is so funny what was it for one thing in particular or was it just you just
[884.62 → 889.16] wanted better internet because it was for because you can't use it when your freaking mom's on the phone
[889.16 → 893.28] or whatever yeah it was for it was for being able to use the internet more often it was for playing
[893.28 → 898.66] games um you've met my friend Tyson yeah, yeah so he and I used to try and play games back in the
[898.66 → 905.26] dial-up days and his family had two phone lines so that he could like game a lot more than me which
[905.26 → 910.46] was good for him but not great for me um so, so like we couldn't play a lot of the time so it was for
[910.46 → 918.50] that as well and for Napster you know we had dial-up, and we also had I don't remember if this
[918.50 → 922.38] is the exact brand of it, but you'll know kind of the category of what I'm talking about yeah we had
[922.38 → 929.50] dial-up, and we had net nanny nice got that net nanny it made it so that and this I'm literally
[929.50 → 933.74] not exaggerating and there's people that I knew including my brother and my dad and my mom and
[933.74 → 938.58] friends from that time that know that I'm not exaggerating I would connect to RuneScape because i
[938.58 → 944.26] played RuneScape when I was a Youngkin um, and it would take so long to load in once I was loaded in
[944.26 → 948.42] it actually wasn't that bad right it would take so long to load in that I could go downstairs computer was
[948.42 → 954.22] upstairs yeah downstairs I could make a sandwich and some juice eat the sandwich drink the juice
[954.22 → 960.78] and you know how slow I eat you're the worst it's amazing that he grew as large as he did
[960.78 → 967.66] at the rate that this man eats like I wouldn't think it's possible for him to consume calories
[967.66 → 974.48] at a rate greater than he can burn them yeah it's its rough so like it that's a very substantial
[974.48 → 978.80] amount of time some people might think like oh it's its quick no um, and it would be like a bacon
[978.80 → 983.92] sandwich like I'd cook bacon like it this is along this is a long time like peanut butter on no
[983.92 → 991.72] no this is a like meal sandwich um a meal sandwich I like that and then I'd go upstairs and
[991.72 → 997.04] it would sometimes not even be done yet but somehow and even when I was a kid I was like this is crazy
[997.04 → 1002.60] it wouldn't time out it would just keep floating it would just keep going eventually I've ever yeah
[1002.60 → 1006.46] eventually we'd connect and I'd be able to play, and eventually we convinced our parents to get rid
[1006.46 → 1011.58] of net nanny, and we also had we had the lines to our house, but we also had the conversations about
[1011.58 → 1016.48] like upgrading our internet and stuff luckily yeah our dad was a gamer so it wasn't that difficult
[1016.48 → 1025.32] of a conversation helps yeah oh man anyway it's dark souls whatever yeah I okay I think that we
[1025.32 → 1031.92] if we're going to poo, poo someone else's choice then I think we have to come up with a better choice
[1031.92 → 1038.26] do you want to go first or do you want me to go first um ultimate game to agree no I don't think we
[1038.26 → 1044.36] have to agree i think we can, I think we can push back on each other uh but i I don't think we
[1044.36 → 1050.10] have to agree because I've I've actually got one ready that I'm I'm not sure what your take on this
[1050.10 → 1057.22] is going to be especially in light of sort of the current state of things um but okay I would
[1057.22 → 1064.56] make the argument if I'm going first I would make the argument for wow I had the same thought I wasn't
[1064.56 → 1072.56] going to say it but I think in in in terms of like moving mountains in a way if you know what i
[1072.56 → 1076.92] mean by that I think there are very few games that have done similar things the amount of cultural impact
[1076.92 → 1082.90] is huge yep the amount of people that played it not as much these days sure yep but like at its peak
[1082.90 → 1091.86] literally everyone I knew played yep, and it's still millions huge it's constantly going down
[1091.86 → 1097.26] it's constantly going extremely poor management etc, but it's still huge I don't I still wouldn't
[1097.26 → 1103.08] say the ultimate game of all time necessarily though personally but I understand the argument
[1103.08 → 1108.56] there's no perfect and I think there is no perfect okay so beat me then come up with a better choice
[1108.56 → 1115.88] yeah so i was going to say doom doom doom really it's boring it is a boring choice it's a boring
[1115.88 → 1121.20] choice wow is definitely a more interesting choice I thought about wow 2 i just the reason why I think
[1121.20 → 1131.30] doom is its even in the big gap you know before doom 2016 yeah and after the last one whatever
[1131.30 → 1136.66] one that was yeah even in that big gap doom was still very culturally relevant there were still
[1136.66 → 1143.78] people going like whoa I got it working on this toaster now it's funny both of us seemed to gravitate
[1143.78 → 1150.32] to cultural relevance for our measure it's its the ultimate game I think it has to be to a certain
[1150.32 → 1158.78] degree but does it couldn't the ultimate game just have fortress amazing music pretty amazing
[1158.78 → 1165.62] art direction amazing story doesn't an ultimate game have to have everything and to me to call doom
[1165.62 → 1173.38] ultimate in this day and age for how technologically limited and how by modern standards rudimentary it is
[1173.38 → 1181.66] and to be clear I'm I'm making arguments against my own so are you only saying wow 2004
[1181.66 → 1191.06] I am not yes I am talking about okay wow not what it's become okay, okay okay, okay
[1191.06 → 1199.54] I don't know I don't know it's so hard I don't know it's really difficult, and the thing is that to
[1199.54 → 1209.44] to pick an ultimate game right it is inherently it's inherently sort of um within the scope of
[1209.44 → 1215.00] your own experiences right like it's hard to detach yourself you know i i would love to say
[1215.00 → 1223.12] that you know uh Final Fantasy 6 is the ultimate game because in my mind there are a lot of things
[1223.12 → 1230.92] that it did as well as or better than almost any modern game, and it managed to do it in 1994 or whenever
[1230.92 → 1236.96] whenever it came out something like that um you know that that incredible cast of characters
[1236.96 → 1245.08] like the the story the music so good i if you can basically copy and paste everything you said
[1245.08 → 1250.00] about that and apply it to wow 2004 and i kind of feel the same way yeah so like yeah I don't know
[1250.00 → 1257.56] and it's just for me wow has this extremely tarnished legacy which sucks but then sure does like a lot of
[1257.56 → 1263.24] so does a lot of the entire gaming industry yes so it's like which is part of why this conversation
[1263.24 → 1268.12] about what's going on at Activision blizzard is so important I was telling this story a few days ago
[1268.12 → 1273.00] about tattoos I don't I don't have any tattoos I'm not against tattoos right I just think I don't care
[1273.00 → 1279.28] okay sure fair enough uh and like why bother get it if I just don't care um but when I was younger i
[1279.28 → 1283.30] like sort of maybe wanted one but I couldn't decide on what I wanted so I wasn't going to get something for
[1283.30 → 1289.84] no reason yeah um and I was like this really, really diehard fan of borrowing and oblivion so I was like
[1289.84 → 1294.68] maybe I should get the like the dragon yeah I was like that'd be thanked goodness you didn't
[1294.68 → 1300.88] yeah yeah and the reason why I didn't was because at that time I luckily had the thought of like
[1300.88 → 1302.48] you know they're still making these
[1302.48 → 1313.42] I'm not gonna I'm not going to do this if is there's like this chance that they're gonna just ruin it
[1313.42 → 1320.06] yeah I love that I love that um that's great, and you know what you know what's hilarious
[1320.06 → 1327.42] is I can't claim to have had a similar thought but if there is a brand that I have ever fanboyed for
[1327.42 → 1331.68] harder than anything else it would be Star Wars
[1331.68 → 1341.68] oh no yeah exactly right like that's how much would it suck yeah to have like I mean you know what
[1341.68 → 1346.30] the thing about Star Wars is that at least if they're gonna you can head cannon it pretty hard
[1346.30 → 1353.58] if there's that and at least if they're going to destroy it um they destroy the names
[1353.58 → 1358.66] and the logos for the new destroyed garbage oh it's different like older it's a little bit so if
[1358.66 → 1364.24] you have like an OG like rebel alliance you know tattoo on your shoulder blade or something like that
[1364.24 → 1369.22] they're going to go to that timeline though I bet you at some point it's there's no way it's sacred
[1369.22 → 1375.10] there's no way yeah nothing is sacred nothing is sacred and I don't even want to hear it chat the
[1375.10 → 1382.52] the new Star Wars movies are objectively trash kind of garbage yeah um, and it's so disappointing
[1382.52 → 1390.34] especially because I think Disney did such a great job with marvel overall i have to admit post endgame
[1390.34 → 1397.60] I'm kind of checked out on MCU there's just been so much it's just kind of too much, and it felt like
[1397.60 → 1405.54] they did this amazing job of largest you know collab of all time um and giving this closure
[1405.54 → 1411.86] and then I just like I watched, and now they still want the next one and i I forget what the next one
[1411.86 → 1417.16] was spider-man something spider-man far from home something like that something like that and I was
[1417.16 → 1423.68] just like yeah this is like entertaining and I watched black widow and I was like yeah this is
[1423.68 → 1429.44] entertaining probably all going to be fine like the MCU has a very solid base minimum you know but I'm
[1429.44 → 1435.78] just not that engaged, and it's not even that like Iron Man was my like favourite avenger or something
[1435.78 → 1441.98] like I'm an adult I don't have a favourite colour or like a favorite fictional character like
[1441.98 → 1446.12] I just don't really I don't really engage with things that way anymore the way that I used to
[1446.12 → 1453.28] like you might so I would say that I probably have a favourite avenger but the amount that I care
[1453.28 → 1460.18] is extremely low if that makes sense sure okay, okay you know what i I mean if we're going to be
[1460.18 → 1465.12] completely off-topic and talking about crap that totally doesn't matter anyway who is your favourite
[1465.12 → 1472.36] avenger Luke Captain America okay i I knew it I'm boring today I wanted to I wanted to I picked doom
[1472.36 → 1480.22] I wanted to say it before you, but you said it so fast I was like gee a blonde haired blue-eyed
[1480.22 → 1487.48] freaking always stands up for the little guy i wonder who Luke would be a fan of
[1487.48 → 1492.78] I like Captain America he's cool I based my haircut off of him I love it yeah yeah I do actually know
[1492.78 → 1497.70] that I wait no I thought you picked Thor for your more recent haircut I tried, and it didn't work so i
[1497.70 → 1502.70] went back to Captain America because it's who I really am oh my goodness all right
[1502.70 → 1510.24] yeah notice how it's short again yes yeah all right okay so i just kind of looked like a mess
[1510.24 → 1516.72] all right cap see but then yeah I don't actually really care so like there 's's that component
[1516.72 → 1522.28] all right fair enough like if he dies I don't even know he might be dead now i I haven't kept up with
[1522.28 → 1529.40] the movies yeah I think he dies of old age so yeah it's like not going to bother me so all right um i
[1529.40 → 1535.60] you know what people are asking they're discussing my favorite marvel superhero i straight
[1535.60 → 1542.54] up do not have one I have the least favourite ones I have ones that I just find intolerable but other
[1542.54 → 1547.56] than that I just don't really who's your least do we go down this my least favourite is superman
[1547.56 → 1553.92] and he's just boringly and all variants of superman there's a lot of them yeah, so there 's's
[1553.92 → 1560.64] a lot of supermen like Captain Marvel is superman is superman like it's just it's not
[1560.64 → 1571.10] interesting um I like i I tend to I tend to like you know your batmen and your uh I guess Iron Man to
[1571.10 → 1579.52] an extent like the ones that are just like a person yeah uh with no particular special powers
[1579.52 → 1585.96] bulletproof yeah and everything else proof bulletproof is not interesting because a lot of the
[1585.96 → 1592.20] a lot of the interesting conflicts that can happen are with you know the grunt level soldiers so being
[1592.20 → 1601.94] able to just mow them down by whipping out your laser eyes it just it creates this sort of um
[1601.94 → 1607.00] disability you also have and I think the MCU might be running into this but I don't care enough
[1607.00 → 1612.50] to know so whatever yeah you have a power ramp issue when you start fighting gods all the time
[1612.50 → 1618.54] or god-like beings or whatever you want to call them yes you have this crazy power ramp issue
[1618.54 → 1626.56] but if humanoid targets are always at least somewhat difficult if they're is they could
[1626.56 → 1633.14] conceivably take you down yeah uh bite pond says batman and superman are not marvel characters yes
[1633.14 → 1640.94] but my point super so Captain Marvel would be a terrible marvel superhero in my opinion because
[1640.94 → 1646.16] she's superman it's a yeah it's just the like incredibly overpowered and vulnerable
[1646.16 → 1652.70] hulk more or less can fly has extremely narrow range of vulnerabilities a superman alike can go
[1652.70 → 1661.24] anywhere instantly and do anything is not interesting um so you know hulk is more interesting to me
[1661.24 → 1668.72] I think the hulk's pretty cool I think in terms of like marvel heroes that i I find boring um you know i
[1668.72 → 1675.28] I think Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job of everything that she was given I wish she was given a
[1675.28 → 1683.86] slightly less crap hero to play um yeah yeah because they and part of that is just a writing problem
[1683.86 → 1690.30] they never really took advantage of her strength yes okay I was just going to say i I like that style of
[1690.30 → 1693.94] quote-unquote superhero though yes because she is just a person, and we were just talking about how
[1693.94 → 1698.60] that's cool yes but I think she's underutilized she was yeah horribly poorly written probably the best
[1698.60 → 1704.88] moment for her in the entire like I guess it's like 25 movies is sort of start to avengers endgame
[1704.88 → 1713.10] the best moment for her is when she's captured by someone supposedly and uh she's like you know been
[1713.10 → 1718.60] you know hit, and she's tied to a chair, and she gets a phone call, and she's like look I'm in the middle of
[1718.60 → 1723.94] an interrogation um because they're like telling her everything and I'm like right that's what she's
[1723.94 → 1729.34] supposed to do she's supposed to be stealthy, and then you've got her like going toe-to-toe with the
[1729.34 → 1735.26] rest of the avengers on that stupid air uh airstrip and I'm like I think they're going to have used her
[1735.26 → 1740.88] like espionage side of things way much more yeah, yeah so that that was extremely disappointing
[1740.88 → 1747.06] yeah uh anyway this is extraordinarily off-topic do we have any other tech things that we can
[1747.06 → 1752.70] talk about uh are we done whatever topic we're currently on i I can't remember what we're talking
[1752.70 → 1758.34] about its official pc's the ultimate hardware all the time okay so no it's not because that's really
[1758.34 → 1764.92] stupid and dark souls is also not because that's really stupid they're both they're both really
[1764.92 → 1773.50] stupid I'm sorry oh my oh you do you golden joystick all right what do you want to talk about
[1773.50 → 1777.84] next we can do this one just because it's fast sure we can offboard onto this onto sponsors maybe
[1777.84 → 1784.76] but tesla uh now to use footage it records of you essentially for this is not a fast topic we got to
[1784.76 → 1790.02] talk about this okay for the full self-driving assistance program uh in its agreement it says
[1790.02 → 1795.46] it is going to use footage from outside and inside the vehicle uh while incident footage has been gathered
[1795.46 → 1801.68] before for AI training the new agreement consents to tesla's collection of VIN associated image data
[1801.68 → 1808.50] so if you get in a crash while using it tesla will have the footage from your car um so wow you spend
[1808.50 → 1815.86] an incredible amount of money for some incredibly extensive surveillance of you
[1815.86 → 1824.66] wow I can understand how this data would be useful oh yeah I'm also stunned because
[1824.66 → 1833.90] if I'm tesla I'm looking at it going hey at some point a regulatory body is going to come after me
[1833.90 → 1842.58] when there's some kind of collision and 16 16 people die we hit a bus yep it's all kids people care
[1842.58 → 1850.18] about kids a lot yep I need to cover my butt in terms of liability that is why this is happening
[1850.18 → 1859.40] full stop so don't imagine anything other than that this is about tesla protecting their own
[1859.40 → 1866.74] liability so that in the event that that happens they are going to do absolutely everything they
[1866.74 → 1872.84] can to pin it on the driver I don't in our notes there isn't a reason so I can't even like
[1872.84 → 1879.02] really debate back because I can't think of I mean it would because it's full self-driving that's the
[1879.02 → 1886.50] confusing part to me well full in full self-driving you are still supposed to be hands basically on
[1886.50 → 1895.10] the wheel right yeah so this is so there's like there's a number of problems here right there's
[1895.10 → 1902.54] the problem that tesla is still using that full self-driving and autopilot branding when neither of
[1902.54 → 1911.56] those things are either of those things um and the other problem is that people are using this
[1911.56 → 1917.72] technology which is not validated it's not fully cooked, and they're using it on public roads
[1917.72 → 1925.34] without any kind of I mean really anything like if I was an insurer at this point i would be trying to
[1925.34 → 1933.48] figure out you know if your car has had this kind of feature I'd be trying to figure out what
[1933.48 → 1939.44] impact that does or should have on your premium because if something goes wrong I don't even know
[1939.44 → 1945.22] who I'm going to go after for it like it's getting it's going to get really complicated so electric's website
[1945.22 → 1953.54] yeah says specifically that uh the fact that tesla added that language specifically related to safety
[1953.54 → 1959.20] risks and accidents would point towards the automaker looking to secure usable evidence in case of an
[1959.20 → 1963.44] accident where its full self-driving system is blamed so yeah they're trying to use it against you
[1963.44 → 1968.98] well that's what electric thinks as well essentially they're agreeing with you uh fantastic says they
[1968.98 → 1976.12] really just need to change the names yeah they really do because ultimately what's going to happen
[1976.12 → 1981.26] is people are going to make assumptions because people do not read detailed documentation on things
[1981.26 → 1988.26] okay in my defence on that whole deleting the desktop environment basically nobody does that was that
[1988.26 → 1994.66] was terminology that even if I had read it I would not have understood that I was removing my entire
[1994.66 → 1998.86] desktop environment or I might have if I was paying really careful attention
[1998.86 → 2004.54] but not when I was reading like I was just doing something basic like installing a program
[2004.54 → 2011.28] anyway the point is people don't read these things they make assumptions based on the names of
[2011.28 → 2018.12] of things like if I okay this product okay it's called the water bottle let's say for example it was
[2018.12 → 2024.14] actually a hammer it was actually yeah it was actually I mean it might be an okay hammer, but it'd probably
[2024.14 → 2029.66] do all right but at some point I'm probably in my use of it as a hammer I'm probably going to make
[2029.66 → 2038.04] some kind of mistake that will cause damage to my hammer or myself, and you know if we installed a
[2038.04 → 2045.18] camera in every one of these the water bottle hammers uh so that we could prove that when you know you
[2045.18 → 2049.78] break the vacuum seal, and it causes some kind of problem or something so that we could prove that it
[2049.78 → 2057.78] was because you were using it as a hammer instead of a water bottle or whatever um you know i
[2057.78 → 2068.76] oh man I wonder what happens if you cover the internal cameras oh I'm pretty sure that it's
[2068.76 → 2074.94] going to disable your your your self-driving oh sorry yeah it would have to yeah obviously so then
[2074.94 → 2080.50] that's the thing too is like tesla is now pulling a bait and switch here because anyone who already
[2080.50 → 2086.62] paid for full self-driving and tesla has been selling full self-driving whether directly whether
[2086.62 → 2093.64] actually taking your money or selling it as a future promise it'll work on this car for years now
[2093.64 → 2101.46] so they have effectively promised something whether it is future self-driving capabilities for your
[2101.46 → 2107.34] vehicle that you can upgrade to or whether it is an actual software package that you have paid them for
[2107.34 → 2115.78] they have promised this under a set of conditions that is no longer accurate so you could make the
[2115.78 → 2123.90] argument and they got sued recently actually over um someone buying a version of a tesla vehicle that
[2123.90 → 2129.18] tesla said would be compatible with full self-driving that they then went back to them and said well it's
[2129.18 → 2133.12] compatible in the sense that you can buy this hardware pay for new hardware in order to upgrade
[2133.12 → 2137.56] them they're like uh actually no that isn't what you said so they're being sued for that I believe
[2137.56 → 2143.86] right now um but I could see I could see this going class action and I could see people suing them saying
[2143.86 → 2151.00] well look I wouldn't have made this purchase if I had realized that having a camera pointed at me
[2151.00 → 2157.40] that is feeding data obviously feeding data onto your server whether they admitted it before or not i
[2157.40 → 2163.18] actually don't remember, but it was obviously doing it, so this is feeding data onto your server that
[2163.18 → 2170.44] monitors me while I'm in a understanding is at least in many jurisdictions a private place I didn't
[2170.44 → 2175.80] know they had inside your car it is yeah it is um I didn't know they had internal cameras at all
[2175.80 → 2179.98] personally oh yeah they do yeah I just didn't know yeah they're to monitor driver attentiveness but
[2179.98 → 2187.84] the claim my understanding is the claim in the past has been that it's locally handled that it's just
[2187.84 → 2194.58] monitoring driver attentiveness oh they might just be changing that it might not send it yeah, yeah right
[2194.58 → 2202.14] oh I see what you mean okay either way yeah if I bought this car based on my understanding that it
[2202.14 → 2209.64] worked as a local attentiveness monitoring thing then effectively that could be an enormous
[2209.64 → 2214.36] class action you could, I could see people potentially getting refunded for the full self-driving
[2214.36 → 2221.88] module if you get or not even that remember the vehicle as well if you bought the vehicle on the
[2221.88 → 2229.34] basis of this perceived upgrade path even if you don't own a full self-driving module you might make
[2229.34 → 2236.12] the argument that I spent an extra x I spent an extra eight thousand dollars on a tesla because my
[2236.12 → 2240.08] understanding was that I was going to have full self-driving that did not involve a camera pointed
[2240.08 → 2249.60] at me and reporting on me to big brother this could be freaking enormous it could be freaking
[2249.60 → 2254.18] enormous AJ says they were saying that it was disabled and would be utilized for the self-driving
[2254.18 → 2260.30] taxi feature in the event of vandalism IRC this is a big problem with tesla is they just yeah they
[2260.30 → 2264.94] change stuff I mean we know who's the problem right they're just they just talk out their butts
[2264.94 → 2270.90] and then the story changes and the tesla fanboys and apologists just say oh, but it's okay because
[2270.90 → 2276.46] they're changing the world they're building the future right, but the ends don't justify the means
[2276.46 → 2282.26] like we actually do need to have integrity about this future that we're building otherwise is it one
[2282.26 → 2287.40] that we really want to live in is a question we should be asking ourselves another question is this
[2287.40 → 2294.58] the ultimate car scandal of all time I'm kidding it's not no there's been some pretty big car scandals
[2294.58 → 2301.62] there's a single automaker that is faultless I mean we've all seen how many people is it
[2301.62 → 2307.34] going to kill versus the cost of the recall calculations yeah um you know every corporation
[2307.34 → 2313.82] past a certain size as far as I can tell is basically monstrous yeah so yep that's the thing
[2313.82 → 2322.08] uh-huh Clem says no that would definitely be nicola motors where they like actually
[2322.08 → 2327.30] had nothing, and they were claiming they had like a semi that worked, but actually they like rolled it
[2327.30 → 2332.84] down a hill and stuff you didn't follow that I forgot about those guys yeah wait what happened that was
[2332.84 → 2339.74] like the Theranos of cars they yeah they just as far as we could tell they had absolutely nothing did
[2339.74 → 2347.32] they take like investment money or something okay yeah I remember hearing about I like i I probably saw
[2347.32 → 2353.98] that video of that truck rolling down the hill uh but yeah that's it yeah oh man
[2353.98 → 2362.64] anyway sponsors yeah we should definitely do sponsors um who sponsored the show today I'm sure
[2362.64 → 2371.60] someone did who meal our first sponsor lttsstore.com oh yeah that's right I'm going there LTT has a black
[2371.60 → 2379.10] Friday deal if you add a meme product to the cart so that is the uh where is it
[2379.10 → 2384.32] why are this why are these not on the front page dang it we've got a sale running we've got a sale
[2384.32 → 2393.22] running you guys so if you add a meme face sequin pillow or a sad Linus or Linus selfie desk pad or
[2393.22 → 2399.88] mouse pad uh you'll get 20 off orders over 30 so basically you buy these and one other thing
[2399.88 → 2407.14] and you're getting the pillow or the mouse or desk pad for like five bucks or ten bucks respectively
[2407.14 → 2412.30] so there you go these sequin pillows are hilarious because you can like to draw on them because they're
[2412.30 → 2419.16] sequin pillows hold on see that's that's one of my favourites actually this is probably my favourite
[2419.16 → 2429.22] sunglasses and joint Linus anyway um right so the actual sponsors of the show
[2429.22 → 2434.88] uh are you managing the meme mess or the merch messages as they come in I definitely haven't been
[2434.88 → 2438.52] yeah cool I have been but if you could just do the ones right now while I'm not looking at it
[2438.52 → 2448.26] uh what does the how do I do this uh-oh um uh-oh I am actually quite confused I think I have broken

[2652.28 → 2657.82] trouble for doing anything like wearing this jacket on the stream earlier i I'm showing off more LTT
[2657.82 → 2663.50] store stuff oh there was actually something that I totally wanted to leak what was it ah
[2663.50 → 2669.34] oh man it was something super cool that I had wanted to talk about I give up all right what's up
[2669.34 → 2678.50] yeah yeah that's fine um i just I updated the discount in the document earlier, and it's different
[2678.50 → 2682.92] than what you said oh it's different from what I said because the Shopify discount implementation is
[2682.92 → 2688.84] like not oh crap okay sorry the Shopify discount implementation is like doesn't allow the thing
[2688.84 → 2696.08] something use BCM to save 15 on any Linus face meme products we can change it to 20 20
[2696.08 → 2700.86] is fine well you don't have to buy anything else oh you don't have to buy anything else oh yeah no
[2700.86 → 2707.72] that would be bad then okay yep yeah so sorry it's only 15 instead of 20 yeah no sorry we would be
[2707.72 → 2715.74] we'd be eating it on that one that would be not very good hey thanks nick hey there you go
[2715.74 → 2723.10] uh data says why is your shipping to the EU so expensive because the EU is super far away
[2723.10 → 2732.10] because shipping to the EU is expensive yeah we're so our average markup on shipping is I think
[2732.10 → 2737.54] somewhere in the neighbourhood of five percent right now or are we even making money on oh it's negative
[2737.54 → 2746.18] 10 percent now uh we're trying to fix it okay yeah it's supposed to be his margin target for
[2746.18 → 2751.70] shipping is 10 so that we'll have like a slush bucket so that we can use to run ship you mightn't
[2751.70 → 2755.64] have noticed we haven't run any shipping promos in a very long time that's because there's no slush
[2755.64 → 2762.40] bucket I didn't know we were losing money on shipping though cool you did know that did I know that okay
[2762.40 → 2768.58] well I've forgotten that I have a few was it his idea um no okay someone's like can I recommend a
[2768.58 → 2775.12] warehouse nearby no you can't operate an additional warehouse is not going to help us save on overhead
[2775.12 → 2782.04] yeah we're fixing it yeah no, no that would just you'd just be paying for it in the cost of the product
[2782.04 → 2787.06] instead of paying for it in the shipping so you're solving one problem adding another
[2787.06 → 2797.60] oh man all right uh yeah why don't we get back to the topics that was a very disruptive thing ah
[2797.60 → 2805.56] yes it is wonderful so now I can say words and damn uh hopefully I just tried out my new swear bleep
[2805.56 → 2813.40] button so we're going to see we're going to see if that worked oh man I love this show that's why that's why
[2813.40 → 2823.82] this show is so great oh okay uh Everett h asks for an update on the kickstarter hammer sent a merch
[2823.82 → 2828.80] message there isn't one there's no update no update on the kickstarter hammer yeah all right
[2828.80 → 2838.54] what do you want to talk about um let's see let's go through some topics GPU prices are going up again
[2838.54 → 2848.64] oh shoot the timing is apparently off for the beep oh, oh boy okay well um Linus please this is a
[2848.64 → 2856.24] Christian stream oh no okay well I thought I was bleeping it that's extremely unfortunate there's a delay
[2856.24 → 2861.66] from when you press the button that's a pretty rough system thorny green this is not a green screen
[2861.66 → 2872.28] is there any eta on it being like not this uh no there's no eta on that, but it's definitely
[2872.28 → 2879.40] not a green screen yeah it just looks oh my goodness great uh oh people want the code people
[2879.40 → 2883.70] want the code for the discount okay we gotta sell some Linus me going to buy your
[2883.70 → 2891.56] meme products meme face products here and uh I can't find it where is it oh here we go here BCM
[2891.56 → 2906.14] BCM here you go guys BCM is the code my brain hurts now all right um what are we talking about
[2906.14 → 2911.20] let's start a topic sure oh my goodness people aren't even tuning out they seem to be they seem
[2911.20 → 2916.68] to be enjoying the technical difficulties more than the show itself viewership's going like this fire
[2916.68 → 2925.78] no, no more fire no enough fire more fires more viewers we need more fire no stop someone
[2925.78 → 2933.38] knock the wall down no please speaking of more fire GPU prices are going up again
[2933.38 → 2939.46] uh I didn't even want to talk about this because we don't have to sad no just do it talk me through it
[2939.46 → 2945.32] a post on a board on the board channels forum indicates that AMD prices are set to increase by
[2945.32 → 2952.90] 10 percent apparently this is mostly due to TSMC foundry costs going up the next shipment of AMD Rx
[2952.90 → 2959.04] 6000 GPUs should reflect the price increase of roughly 20 to 40 USD per card this cost is currently
[2959.04 → 2966.06] affecting uh add-in board partners uh so if we're lucky that won't be passed on to the consumer lol
[2966.06 → 2973.42] uh there's not enough margin there's literally no chance yeah that is not a thing I'm going to say
[2973.42 → 2980.22] that's a zero percent uh probability oh yeah yeah that's that literally can't work like he was saying
[2980.22 → 2985.22] the margins are so low it's just it's not gonna it's not going to happen um there are rumours that AMD is
[2985.22 → 2996.04] switching from TSMC to Samsung that would be fascinating yeah I doubt it yeah I mean going from
[2996.04 → 3004.36] one process node to another one like that is not uh I mean it's possible that AMD was already
[3004.36 → 3010.52] working on that if it's is it's been in the works for a while then sure but like yeah but i
[3010.52 → 3015.02] doubt they're trying to figure out how to dual source their current products that's probably going
[3015.02 → 3021.88] to be something that's more like rDNA 3 or something like that yeah a lot of their recent
[3021.88 → 3026.76] success has been working with TSMC absolutely that's very true a lot of a lot of everyone's
[3026.76 → 3033.08] recent success has been working with TSMC I think you can pretty much draw a line in between people
[3033.08 → 3043.24] with recent success and people who don't work with TSMC um with this news coming off the heels of the 10
[3043.24 → 3050.28] price hike humour or sorry rumour uh it is may be that AMD simply can't afford to continue using TSMC
[3051.88 → 3058.14] that one I'm not so certain about, but it would definitely eat margins really badly yeah and
[3058.14 → 3063.98] I can understand why they would want a price hike um Samsung is apparently building a new 17
[3063.98 → 3069.96] billion dollar advanced chip plant in Texas an estimated production start date of 2024 it will
[3069.96 → 3074.68] also as far as my understanding goes take them a fair amount of time to like warm up to their full
[3074.68 → 3083.78] capabilities yeah um, and they could make apparently chips as advanced as three nanometre dang whoa dang
[3083.78 → 3089.56] whoa three nanometre sounds pretty good that's that's very few nanometres that is a very small
[3089.56 → 3096.40] that's a very small number that is a 100 confirmed very small amount of yeah no not that's not enough
[3096.40 → 3101.52] nanometres quite frankly we need more I think I need more nanometres I mean why do we accept three
[3101.52 → 3107.00] nanometres when we could have 35 nanometres yeah I'm cheesed well maybe 35 is too much I think 14 is
[3107.00 → 3111.96] the right number of nanometres the exact perfect amount let's go back to 14 should never move off
[3111.96 → 3122.34] of let's have 14 nanometres forever oh boy okay so yeah that's a thing that's sad yeah that's like
[3122.34 → 3130.08] really disappointing but also basically has already been happening this is just in my mind yeah uh AMD and
[3130.08 → 3138.84] TSMC just clawing back some of the value that had been scooped up by bottom feeders later on in the
[3138.84 → 3146.08] chain I mean this comes back to a conversation we had more recently where we talked about okay um
[3146.08 → 3151.46] if a GPU is going to be a thousand dollars instead of five hundred dollars who should get that money right
[3151.46 → 3157.44] should it be TSMC and AMD who like actually made investments and designed and built these things
[3157.44 → 3165.80] or should it be some scalper on Facebook marketplace if someone has to have it I guess it should be
[3165.80 → 3171.16] like you know the people putting the people putting the R&D into the product so that at the end
[3171.16 → 3179.76] of the day at least if it sucks for gamers today in theory it turns into bigger R&D budgets for better
[3179.76 → 3187.12] products for gamers in the future if capitalism is working correctly or hopefully more fab capacity
[3187.12 → 3194.06] or whatever that's exactly it yeah so it can be reinvested yeah because some Facebook marketplace
[3194.06 → 3201.22] you know scalper is not reinvesting in any way other than to build a better bot so that they can
[3201.22 → 3210.58] scalp you harder next time yeah oh uh gamers nexus want to talk about this one yeah let's talk about
[3210.58 → 3221.02] gamers nexus buys a scam in quotes pre-built from burrower with a 10-year-old GPU yikes it's the burrower
[3221.02 → 3231.30] element mini 167a for 700 bucks it has a dozen 5 3600 uh it's eight gigabytes of 3000 megahertz ram a 250
[3231.30 → 3246.18] gigabyte SSD and a two gigabyte GT 730 which is a 730 in name only it is a fermi GF 108-300-a1 aka a GT 430
[3246.18 → 3253.26] oh that wasn't even a good card when it came out um was that literally the card no I don't think so
[3253.26 → 3259.96] I don't think so you know what I'm talking about 10 or something or 240 or something I know what you're
[3259.96 → 3267.78] talking about yeah yeah yeah um big yikes the Amazon listing they bought it from uh had a bunch of
[3267.78 → 3273.98] mistakes like listing 16 gigabytes of ram one gigabyte hard drive in a four core processor what okay
[3273.98 → 3279.12] unsurprisingly this is the worst pre-built they've ever bought most benchmark games they use wouldn't
[3279.12 → 3284.70] even run games that did run had horrible performance uh the ANO performs better than
[3284.70 → 3292.20] this thing nice a neo i have to i have to confess um i kind of feel like this is sort of water is wet
[3292.20 → 3299.78] yeah like wait what uh revelation here because pre-built with old crappy GPUs um many of which are
[3299.78 → 3309.02] rebranded even older crappy GPUs are not really a new thing um to be clear I don't think
[3309.02 → 3317.24] burrower should be marketing this as a gaming desktop at all that's really stupid but this also
[3317.24 → 3324.56] isn't really anything new like I remember buying at future shop we talked about good old future shop
[3324.56 → 3330.58] not that long ago I remember you know buying something that the sales rep told us would be
[3330.58 → 3335.10] good for gaming when I didn't know anything about computers yet and finding out that it had onboard
[3335.10 → 3340.42] graphics like and remember this was back when intel's onboard graphics were not even like good
[3340.42 → 3345.70] onboard graphics I still remember going to the future shop in Langley back when future shop existed
[3345.70 → 3351.72] yeah and trying to find a graphics card with my dad and going through all the different components
[3351.72 → 3356.10] that they had there and stuff and like the old art that used to be on graphics card boxes I know
[3356.10 → 3362.70] right and like I know nothing about it my dad luckily knew some stuff so that was great but like I knew
[3362.70 → 3369.08] nothing so I was like oh pretty box art I want this one um but yeah I don't know i this is very
[3369.08 → 3376.40] confused so the notes are talking about an Amazon article which is like interesting and then
[3376.40 → 3380.58] the link for the element mini is to the Microsoft store
[3380.58 → 3391.38] which seems to have things listed correctly in terms of specs yeah i uh I think that the big problem
[3391.38 → 3402.00] is just that this GT 730 is a GT 430 which was garbage when it came out and is definitely garbage today
[3402.00 → 3410.16] and obviously doesn't perform very well, so the big problem here is calling things gaming when
[3410.16 → 3418.52] they are obviously not capable of gaming in any kind of modern sense so that's what's going on here
[3418.52 → 3423.42] though like is NVIDIA calling this card that is burrower just like stickering it like what's
[3423.42 → 3430.38] what's happening here I don't fully I feel like I'm missing something am I just being dumb um
[3430.38 → 3444.12] yeah I mean it's all stuff so it's all stuff that's bad but none of it is new yeah so that's kind of that's
[3444.12 → 3450.86] kind of where I'm at on this okay, okay yeah okay, and you know honestly at 600 us dollars it's not
[3450.86 → 3457.38] exactly a great deal or anything, but it's not like you aren't getting you know it's not like that would
[3457.38 → 3465.24] cost a ton more than 600 or a ton more than 700 dollars excuse me it's not like it would cost you
[3465.24 → 3471.54] my trip is starting to catch up to me a little bit I have not slept enough I am pretty good at
[3471.54 → 3475.78] managing jet lag can you talk about that at all can you even say where you were uh I was in Tel Aviv
[3475.78 → 3480.14] okay yeah yeah, and we're going to end it there, and we're gonna we're going to end it right there yeah
[3480.14 → 3488.24] um just so people understand why there's jet lag going on, so this is a 3600 dozen 5 that's a 270
[3488.24 → 3494.50] dollar Canadian processor so what is that like 210 200 around 200 us dollars something like that
[3494.50 → 3499.62] uh you know there's some ram there's a case you know there's a power supply so RGB fans as far as
[3499.62 → 3506.22] RGB fans like it's its not like um it's not like a scam in the sense that you think you're buying
[3506.22 → 3512.68] a computer, and it ships with a brick inside you know like 20 worth of concrete
[3512.68 → 3518.86] or like you know cement inside it like it's not like that, but it's just a really, really terrible
[3518.86 → 3525.78] deal which again is nothing new in the pre-built computer yeah and I guess the whole like this
[3525.78 → 3532.08] is still this old graphics card thing is not new either but bringing light to it's probably pretty
[3532.08 → 3537.56] chill yeah and that shouldn't be a thing rebranding products shouldn't be a thing that's
[3537.56 → 3543.84] something we've spoken out about in the past because the only reason to do it is to mislead
[3543.84 → 3550.60] users to make them think that it's something newer than what it is that's literally the only reason to
[3550.60 → 3556.80] do it so we've criticized rebadging graphics cards in particular seem to go through this a lot oh and
[3556.80 → 3560.98] they've been going through it for the entire time that I've been interested in computers as well
[3560.98 → 3567.28] yeah more or less like it's this is not even close to new I still remember getting absolutely
[3567.28 → 3575.34] like enraged at sapphire way back in the day because there was like a variant of i actually
[3575.34 → 3582.16] wow i actually finally forget the details of it I guess time does heal all wounds
[3582.16 → 3590.66] it was some variant of like a 9600 or something like that that had a cut down memory bus
[3590.66 → 3596.48] because that was the big one back in the day was they would have the memory bus
[3596.48 → 3602.10] which would dramatically change the performance because you are essentially
[3602.10 → 3609.24] cutting the memory bandwidth in half and that's not something that was typically disclosed on a spec
[3609.24 → 3614.78] sheet so I bought just so that in my parents machine there would be something like sort of usable
[3614.78 → 3620.80] for my siblings I bought what I thought was a decent GPU, but it was you know 15 20 cheaper
[3620.80 → 3624.90] and I put it in there and I was like this performance is trash what the heck is going on
[3624.90 → 3629.32] here this should be better because I had like the real version in my own machine like a year prior or
[3629.32 → 3636.30] something like that and I found out that it was only disclosed and that was the only way I was able
[3636.30 → 3641.40] to figure it out because i maybe I didn't have access to tools like GPU z yet or something, but it was
[3641.40 → 3647.60] only disclosed on like their European site that it was a 64-bit bus card when it was supposed to be a
[3647.60 → 3653.80] 128 bit like it was not listed on ATI at the time it wasn't listed on ATI's website anywhere as
[3653.80 → 3660.62] that that was a variant of this GPU that existed so I made the argument to them that I should be able
[3660.62 → 3664.92] to get a refund or that they should swap it for one with a 128 bit bus because the retailer didn't
[3664.92 → 3671.04] list it properly NCI um their product information didn't have it on their North American site where I had
[3671.04 → 3677.66] you know gone to double-check um so I had no way of knowing that I was buying some garbage card
[3677.66 → 3685.96] um and so that's all terrible rebadging things quietly changing the specs without changing the label
[3685.96 → 3692.62] those are both bad even though they're kind of the opposite behaviour uh they're just they're super-duper
[3692.62 → 3699.50] nothing new and for as long as the tech industry has and will exist it's going to continue to be a thing
[3699.50 → 3708.44] probably yep so there you go all right should we move on to our next topic yeah but um shame on
[3708.44 → 3718.48] you Amazon reseller and uh Microsoft and nzxt2 for having the word gaming in the description of that
[3718.48 → 3725.40] desktop I'll say that much honestly you'd probably be better off just getting the APU version of that
[3725.40 → 3732.68] chip and running on the onboard yeah gaming desktop yeah that's just yeah I feel like they're almost
[3732.68 → 3738.98] just saying that because like some marketing person was like well it has the ribs yeah maybe we should
[3738.98 → 3749.02] call it the gamings uh next topic though Devon s I think just bought one of everything on the entire
[3749.02 → 3756.04] site a mystery water bottle a short circuit long sleeve a tech scarf a dad hat three mystery t-shirts
[3756.04 → 3762.22] one Ethernet shirt a mean face sequin pillow a banana scale in every colour a do not drop t-shirt
[3762.22 → 3768.58] and other CPU pillow did I already say CPU pillow no a CPU pillow a party shirt did I already say party
[3768.58 → 3776.16] shirt I can't even keep track and a water bottle wow unbelievable um okay talk about doing
[3776.16 → 3780.46] some Black Friday shopping I mean we only offered a 15 discount, and it's only on one item you don't
[3780.46 → 3788.64] have to buy everything I mean you can um, but you don't have to Microsoft and Qualcomm so in the past
[3788.64 → 3793.62] few weeks MediaTek has been expressing interest in building their own arm chips that can run windows
[3793.62 → 3802.92] turns out there's a snag and DA as DA developers reported uh the reason that we've only seen Qualcomm
[3802.92 → 3810.80] Windows pcs is because Microsoft and Qualcomm have an exclusivity deal the sources say it is set to
[3810.80 → 3817.30] expire soon with no known date, but that would explain why we've only seen Qualcomm powered devices
[3817.30 → 3824.44] since they were first announced by the two companies in 2016 maybe a five-year agreement let's hope the
[3824.44 → 3828.96] end of this agreement could mean windows arm licensing could be opened up to a lot more chips including
[3828.96 → 3834.60] potentially Apple Silicon that was something that was extremely disappointing to me about the apple
[3834.60 → 3841.62] silicon max was that if you wanted to run windows even though Microsoft had an arm version you couldn't
[3841.62 → 3848.32] do it yeah unless you wanted to you know actually is there a way to do it through like emulation
[3848.32 → 3854.00] I don't know does parallels have a solution for that you guys will have to let me know in the chat i
[3854.00 → 3861.36] don't daily drive uh a mac, so there hasn't been any reason for me to solve this problem um wow that's
[3861.36 → 3870.90] that's a real drag and a half I mean I guess i kind of get it because if I was Microsoft and i
[3870.90 → 3878.18] desperately needed some kind of silicon apparently snazzy labs has done it yeah there you go um yes you can
[3878.18 → 3884.84] parallels it if I was desperate for there to be some kind of silicon for me to even you know continue
[3884.84 → 3893.32] to develop my windows arm software on to have any you know reason for it to exist at all then I might
[3893.32 → 3901.60] make a deal like that so that kind of makes sense yeah apparently parallels with windows for arm is
[3901.60 → 3912.74] fantastic okay good to know so I don't man see the problem with arm windows for me
[3912.74 → 3923.22] is its just one of those like why things yeah like if i the only reason that I daily drive windows
[3923.22 → 3930.78] aside from familiarity which honestly is not that big of a deal like i I do such basic things outside
[3930.78 → 3935.48] my web browser now anyway that it kind of doesn't matter so the only reason for me to daily drive
[3935.48 → 3944.36] windows is gaming and if I was going to game arm is clearly not a reasonable option yeah and if I was
[3944.36 → 3949.68] not going to game then I think based on everything we learned from the Linux challenge I would probably
[3949.68 → 3957.24] just I mean I was perfectly happy with Manjaro KDE other than gaming you're spoiling the next episode
[3957.24 → 3963.30] a little bit oh well I guess a little bit but uh I don't know maybe it's not that bad to spoil it a
[3963.30 → 3968.54] little bit since people are so outraged about the uh the streaming episode people are a little cheesed
[3968.54 → 3973.40] about that one a little cheese the next episode is can I say what it is I guess yeah yeah go for it the
[3973.40 → 3981.14] next episode is like random productivity tasks yeah so non-gaming tasks that you do there's a 12 page
[3981.14 → 3987.56] thread on the forum about the second episode and i i I replied to it at one point i was like
[3987.56 → 3993.76] people keep saying that the problems that I had are related to my exotic hardware other than my go SLR
[3993.76 → 4000.20] what about my hardware is exotic go SLR isn't exotic either that has caused any problems I'll wait
[4000.20 → 4006.54] and people launched into these explanations of how my hardware is exotic but where they never managed to
[4006.54 → 4014.62] get to was how it caused any of the problems that I actually had yeah and to be clear um the legato
[4014.62 → 4020.54] lights for example I never presented that as a problem because my workaround for it was very easy
[4020.54 → 4026.20] I didn't have to solve anything I just used my phone um most of my problems like in my raw doc did
[4026.20 → 4031.18] have you share that raw doc with you no actually that's just my like I haven't technically yeah my
[4031.18 → 4036.44] thoughts doc well we weren't supposed to see each other right we both have one right yeah the vast
[4036.44 → 4044.48] majority of my issues in my doc have nothing to do with that I'm running a thread ripper and
[4044.48 → 4050.14] therefore the people who develop Linux you know they're just using their own hardware and they
[4050.14 → 4055.58] wouldn't necessarily be able to test on that do you grow your own CPU Linus i never i never
[4055.58 → 4061.28] said they did I never said anything about any of that i never things have not I never said it had any
[4061.28 → 4066.70] stability problems i the problems were just that everything's a chore I've been kind of following
[4066.70 → 4072.06] along on the I have never mentioned that I've even known this existed but I guess people probably knew
[4072.06 → 4078.74] I've been following along on the mint forums oh I see yeah because my brain went to average user
[4078.74 → 4083.88] right so I was like because especially at the beginning yeah but throughout the whole thing we
[4083.88 → 4089.58] weren't allowed to like to ask for help etc yeah so if I had a problem one of my things was like well I don't
[4089.58 → 4093.96] know I'd probably go back to the thing that I got so I went on mint's website and I was like there's
[4093.96 → 4098.18] a forum this all seems like things that I would maybe do so I went to the forum I started poking
[4098.18 → 4104.18] around and then I started noticing after we posted one video that there was a thread about the video
[4104.18 → 4108.06] on the mint forums and I was like oh I'm going to see what people are saying they've actually been
[4108.06 → 4115.06] decently nice r slash Linux has been surprisingly there are both sides for sure but yeah they've been
[4115.06 → 4122.54] but anything that manages to get any kind of upvote momentum has been mostly like yeah we understand
[4122.54 → 4128.70] the spirit of where this is coming from and there's also I'm seeing a bit of a tide turn
[4128.70 → 4135.74] in some of the sentiment anyway where people are saying hey you know all the problematic things
[4135.74 → 4143.08] that you might find about this aside this has already generated discussion and improvements
[4143.08 → 4152.82] to the experience so for better or for worse Linus and Luke were 100 successful hey in what they were
[4152.82 → 4160.02] trying to do got him which was to go in as people who have not tried to daily drive Linux for gaming
[4160.02 → 4168.44] and talk about the experience yeah generate discussion and hopefully turn that into something
[4168.44 → 4173.94] that will become better in the future if it isn't already good now and which it isn't I mean
[4173.94 → 4183.02] I mentioned a while ago that I pivoted my work laptop yep um i I pivoted it to I'll finally say it now
[4183.02 → 4189.28] I left it vague last time I went to Ubuntu oh okay because I was like you know what I said I didn't
[4189.28 → 4195.76] want to use try the vanilla because try vanilla you know it's a good flavour it is a good i uh i
[4195.76 → 4200.68] said that I didn't want to use it because I don't like gnome 3 yeah but I had never used gnome 3 you
[4200.68 → 4207.02] hater what a hater so but exactly so I was like I'm going to go use it haters going to hate hate hate
[4207.02 → 4213.68] honestly gnome 3 is fine I still think I prefer mint yeah and the cinnamon experience and all that kind
[4213.68 → 4219.06] of stuff sure so I'm probably going to pivot my laptop again but like if it's been completely fine
[4219.06 → 4224.90] I'm just a creature of habit and there was nothing about KDE that super offended me so yeah if I was
[4224.90 → 4229.70] going to go Linux again the number of people that are like and all your problems because you chose arch
[4230.26 → 4235.14] well like hold on a second the amount of criticism I've taken for going with Manjaro
[4235.78 → 4243.54] is kind of mind-blowing especially because Manjaro has not really caused any of my problems' no I mean
[4243.54 → 4250.90] they saw some of my early struggles figuring out that apt was not a thing on Manjaro which i
[4250.90 → 4258.58] just didn't know because every guide you find for anything is like apt get whatever so apt good i
[4258.58 → 4265.22] I mean once I figured out pa mac was a thing um and Pac-Man was a thing I was like this is great I've got
[4265.22 → 4272.42] my graphical version and I've got my command line terminal version, and so I will just do this from
[4272.42 → 4280.18] now on um, so these are all things that I figured out but Manjaro did not cause any of my problems and
[4280.18 → 4286.10] I don't think that it was an entirely unreasonable thing for me to do because the rationale was well
[4286.10 → 4292.66] my number one choice didn't work out for reasons that the OS maker has admitted were not entirely my
[4292.66 → 4298.50] fault um and the upstream has admitted was not entirely my fault fixes have been applied for
[4298.50 → 4308.66] what happened to me not by me um, so my first choice didn't work out my second choice was well i
[4308.66 → 4318.34] know that steam OS 3.0 is going to be an arch derivative so maybe some of the work that valve is doing
[4318.34 → 4324.42] on proton or compatibility seam compatibility layer or whatever they call it maybe that would also be
[4324.42 → 4331.94] applicable in some way to and also an arch alike so I'm going to try that because it also came highly
[4331.94 → 4336.74] recommended those were the main things that I was thinking about my number one didn't work
[4336.74 → 4344.82] out maybe something arch based would be a better bet in some way because i and that's another thing too
[4344.82 → 4350.82] is like what's supported so I had already I had already gone for the Ubuntu based, and it was a big
[4350.82 → 4357.86] problem for me so I was like well the other main sort of thing we're at least aware of yeah yeah and the
[4357.86 → 4364.90] one that the valve obviously chose for some reason for gaming is arch so I was like I'm not going to try
[4364.90 → 4372.42] to tackle arch itself by the way so I'm just going to I'm just going to try this like I'm going to try
[4372.42 → 4383.54] arch with training wheels, and honestly it was fine, so none of my problems were really specific to a
[4383.54 → 4389.46] distro in my opinion yes I had problems with dolphin but I would have probably found problems with the
[4389.46 → 4395.78] default application choices in any distro and I would have probably found problems with cohesion
[4395.78 → 4401.14] in any distro because those are Linux desktop problems and I think definitely exist I think
[4401.14 → 4410.90] another problem that's going on is some people in the community I think are ignoring the fact that
[4410.90 → 4416.10] we would complain about windows too yeah we brought this up a couple of times like we're not going like
[4416.10 → 4422.34] windows is perfect therefore these things suck it's just, but these things can suck and windows
[4422.34 → 4430.10] can suck yes everything can suck everything can be imperfect yeah I mean there are things I hate about
[4430.10 → 4436.98] I've actually literally uploaded videos of just lists of things I hate about operating systems uh windows
[4436.98 → 4445.38] more recently but um oh man back when we did that series of 10 reasons macOS is just better
[4446.10 → 4452.66] and 10 or 10 reasons windows is better yeah the number of people that interpreted macOS being
[4452.66 → 4458.98] better to mean that windows is worse or vice versa just because something has something better doesn't
[4458.98 → 4466.34] mean that it is better like the point I'm trying to make is things can be good and things can be bad
[4466.34 → 4471.54] and that doesn't inherently make the other thing good or the other thing bad it just means that if we're
[4471.54 → 4477.06] being objective anything has lots of stuff about it that is crap and lots of stuff about it that is
[4477.06 → 4484.42] good and that's okay like Luke and I had a super frustrating windows gaming experience last night
[4485.78 → 4491.62] where and I don't know who to blame could be Microsoft could be valved um could be whoever the
[4491.62 → 4498.34] developer is for tower fall I don't know, but we were having issues with remote play trying to play tower fall with
[4498.34 → 4504.66] my kids locally and Luke remotely, and we just couldn't get four controllers working properly
[4504.66 → 4509.22] without one of them either not working at all or one of them controlling two players at the same time
[4509.22 → 4516.98] three or even three and I would say that that's a crap experience that's a crap user experience and
[4516.98 → 4522.18] to contrast this just in case you weren't going to go there we played tower fall through remote play
[4522.18 → 4528.42] on Linux flawlessly and immediately with three players fair which worked perfectly last night too
[4529.22 → 4532.82] it was the fourth player that was causing trouble did it work perfectly right away I don't think so
[4532.82 → 4538.82] oh I still had okay no the first issue we had was that it seems like I think like Yvonne's thunderbolt
[4538.82 → 4545.06] doc died or something like yeah so that was unrelated no but I mean even once you had like gone downstairs
[4545.06 → 4552.74] I can't remember okay I can't remember I'm not sure, so sorry yeah there 's's there's bad there
[4552.74 → 4563.38] there are bad experiences everywhere um yeah and I guess the point of the series was can you switch today
[4564.02 → 4571.46] as the average gamer and the answer is well the answer is complicated so the answer is
[4571.46 → 4576.34] complicated apparently the go SLR for Linux project added better installation instructions that's
[4576.34 → 4583.14] pretty cool so you know I've seen some criticism that I was too hard on what is obviously a grassroots
[4583.14 → 4590.90] community project I mean i i I don't think I hated on them, but the experience wasn't very good and for
[4590.90 → 4596.82] better or for worse the experience is now better because of what I said apparently the developer agrees
[4596.82 → 4605.62] like oh I see your point I guess I could make this better, and now it is better so that's why reviewers
[4605.62 → 4613.86] exist that's why critics exist so it's not that I'm trying to be a jerk about it, I'm just my job going
[4613.86 → 4618.98] into this was to evaluate it and that's why we had said on I think it was last week on when show we had
[4618.98 → 4624.74] said maybe a cool follow-up would be to go in and experience windows fresh yeah now I just threw my old
[4624.74 → 4629.30] drive back in because I just wanted to play some video games and not think about it for a little
[4629.30 → 4639.94] bit but i I intend to put a fresh drive in start from scratch and review windows I'd do it too are we
[4639.94 → 4645.14] yeah there's the there's the two different version potential as well Windows 10 and Windows 11 I'm
[4645.14 → 4650.66] going to go Windows 11 yeah okay I'm going to go Windows 11 and I'm going to have the warts and all
[4650.66 → 4656.34] someone brought up an interesting argument um and there are some generalizations here and I noticed
[4656.34 → 4661.06] that when I first read it but so I'm going to try to quote, but it's not in front of me so whatever
[4661.06 → 4668.90] but they essentially said no one installs windows that's not true people buy a computer and windows is on
[4668.90 → 4677.06] it sure, but that's also that's a not true and b doesn't excuse a bad installation experience yeah if
[4677.06 → 4683.30] it's a Microsoft product which the installation experience is then what's the excuse for it being
[4683.30 → 4689.06] bad you're a multi tens of billions of dollars company no, no I don't accept that okay
[4689.06 → 4694.50] that's fair enough yeah no I think the majority of people well definitely the majority of people don't
[4694.50 → 4698.26] that's fair it's still part of the process, but it's a Microsoft product if it's a Microsoft product
[4698.26 → 4704.90] then it should be polished you're charging me money for it man I paid for it, I think such a substantial
[4704.90 → 4710.98] part of the windows video is going to be the amount of things you have to click when you're
[4710.98 → 4716.02] going through the installation process yeah yeah I could see that it's crazy and there's just there's
[4716.02 → 4722.98] just shockingly stupid stuff like you go through this whole process, and it's like you install the
[4722.98 → 4727.06] whole operating system then you like do all this stuff then you sit, and you wait for like four more
[4727.06 → 4731.38] minutes well it's like hey we're setting things upsetting things up well what were you doing before yeah
[4731.38 → 4737.30] yeah yeah what and i actually really like I believe if I remember correctly Ubuntu did this
[4737.30 → 4742.50] and I know mint did this but you do the installation and then there's just a window that you can close if
[4742.50 → 4747.30] you want that's all the customization stuff and windows does all this forced customization stuff while
[4747.30 → 4753.30] you're going through the setup and going back to the Windows version after installing mint and Ubuntu
[4753.30 → 4760.42] was so frustrating if I just wanted to use my damn computer right now like why are you stopping me
[4760.42 → 4766.74] so that I can what make it look green like I don't care I can do this whenever yeah this is a low
[4766.74 → 4773.22] priority task yeah yeah uh 88 pocket says Windows 10 pro needs to drop preloaded crap like Candy Crush
[4773.22 → 4784.10] what professional expects or wants Candy Crush yes that's so stupid 100 100 oh 100 oh maybe they will
[4784.10 → 4792.50] because blizzard is uh Microsoft said that they were thinking about re uh how did they word it
[4793.06 → 4796.74] they're gonna look at their relationship with blizzard and like re-establish what they're doing
[4796.74 → 4801.14] there because of like bobby comic and all the stuff that's going on does blizzard own king yeah oh i
[4801.14 → 4805.06] didn't realize that or our Activision I guess yeah whatever blizzard Activision yeah or sorry
[4805.06 → 4813.38] activation blizzard yeah okay hilarious so hopefully that happens hopefully because that is
[4813.38 → 4822.42] so dumb brutal oh or tear or tear said on the last stream you had something in your bag you wanted
[4822.42 → 4831.38] to show us what's in the bag okay first first I used uh the LTT backpack prototype for my trip
[4831.38 → 4841.14] oh, and it's even better than I thought you know how the size is kind of big it fits perfectly under
[4841.14 → 4846.58] an airline seat there's also no scuffs which is great oh yeah no I mean the material choice i
[4846.58 → 4851.14] already knew was outstanding I'm just saying because this is a lot of bags and stuff the second you go on a
[4851.14 → 4856.98] trip yeah tossing around an airplane do all this kind of stuff they get yeah but yeah it looks
[4856.98 → 4863.22] brandy looks immaculate yeah actually yeah um the like additional structure of it was great because
[4863.22 → 4866.90] it makes it really easy to put really bulky stuff in and out of it because I was like constantly
[4866.90 → 4872.10] throwing my because you're on plane right it's like I'm freezing jacket I'm too hot I'm too hot yeah
[4872.98 → 4877.14] right so I was constantly putting things in and out of it I had my whole gaming setup while I was there so
[4877.14 → 4886.82] I had my e GPU my laptop my mouse pad my mouse I was like set up man um so I was constantly going in
[4886.82 → 4891.94] and out of if it was great uh so that's one of the that's one of the big takeaways for me is we're
[4891.94 → 4897.62] actually we were going to change something significant so see this three-way zip pocket on the front yes
[4899.22 → 4905.06] on the inside I'm going to try and show everyone on the inside there's this mesh pocket and I had
[4905.06 → 4911.06] concerns about the mesh pocket because when you open it up all the way it's kind of floods doodle
[4911.86 → 4916.34] and I didn't really like that I thought it was kind of not a great experience because if you have
[4916.34 → 4921.78] something heavy in here it just kind of like weighs it down um so I didn't like it so I had said okay
[4921.78 → 4927.78] you know what let's do the self is what this is called when it's the same material as the body let's
[4927.78 → 4932.66] do the self let's do some pockets here and let's try to discourage people from loading this up with
[4932.66 → 4938.10] stuff but what I realized when I was actually using it day to day on my trip was that how I actually use
[4938.10 → 4943.22] it is like this I don't open it all the way it's nice to be able to open it all the way if I really need to
[4944.02 → 4948.82] but I don't really open it all the way I just use it like this, and then it has enough structure and
[4948.82 → 4952.82] it was actually really nice to just have a mesh pocket that I could Huck everything in and then
[4952.82 → 4959.06] if I really need to see what I'm doing i can look into it uh we are making some changes in here
[4959.06 → 4963.22] so for example the screwdriver sticks up right now so we're going to have the screwdriver pocket go all the
[4963.22 → 4967.54] way down that's one of my big things is I want our products to be compatible with each other makes sense
[4967.54 → 4972.10] I remember back when we first started working together one of the gripes that we had all the
[4972.10 → 4976.34] time was like case and power supply manufacturers yeah the power supply is not fitting you buy an
[4976.34 → 4981.70] Anzac case and like their flagship case, and you buy their flagship power supply, and it like doesn't fit
[4981.70 → 4986.98] in it like stuff like that yes so we want to make sure that there's a place to put the screwdriver
[4986.98 → 4993.30] so this pocket is going to become only this big and then what I realized again is because of this
[4993.30 → 5001.86] this zip here needs to start on this side so that you can access the zipper more easily and open
[5001.86 → 5009.14] it when it's not open all the way, so the intention is that this can open, but you don't have to um
[5009.14 → 5015.54] that makes sense we're also reconfiguring the slips on the inside so we've got three slips like three
[5015.54 → 5021.70] slips for devices we've got a laptop pouch a tablet pouch and then one that's intended for more like a
[5021.70 → 5028.98] Nintendo Switch or like a steam deck or something like that and the problem is that we did two slips
[5028.98 → 5034.02] on this side and one slip at the bottom on this side and what happens is when you've got heavy stuff
[5034.02 → 5041.06] up here it weighs down the top so that that slip kind of sticks out, and it's almost impossible to get
[5041.06 → 5045.38] down into the bottom of the pocket without like kind of making your way in there so we're going to do
[5045.38 → 5051.86] the three slips on the back now assuming we can sew through that much material like there's just so
[5051.86 → 5058.26] many little things that i kind of like learned about it yeah overall it's really close um it's going to
[5058.26 → 5064.98] be really expensive but I can, it's the best bag I've ever had and I can pretty much promise that unless you've
[5064.98 → 5071.86] I don't know i I haven't encountered something that's better like from a tech standpoint so
[5073.06 → 5080.18] i I doubt that you've owned a better bag basically what's that um oh this
[5081.62 → 5089.06] uh oh I actually meant that that's on your like hip oh I'll talk about that later okay um, so this is
[5089.06 → 5095.22] the thing that I was gonna that I was going to pull out of my bag um the I mean the steam deck is not
[5095.22 → 5102.98] the only handheld gaming pc and AYA they did send me that clear one when they initially launched but
[5104.18 → 5110.26] that neo doesn't have some of the improvements of their new one and I was like oh um wow that's
[5110.26 → 5115.06] super cool when they kind of sent me this update thing, and they were like oh yeah well we'll
[5115.06 → 5118.42] send you one if you want I was like okay well I mean I didn't asking for anything but
[5118.42 → 5124.82] um you know what I'd really like actually is the new some of the new features on my old one like
[5124.82 → 5128.74] if you could just send me those parts I'd be happy to upgrade it myself because I really like the clear
[5128.74 → 5134.98] housing, and they were like well it's not that simple um so we'd rather just send you a new one
[5134.98 → 5142.34] by the way we have this colour that looks so cool they did a retro colourway oh my goodness with like
[5142.34 → 5153.70] red gray almost black um army drab green yeah so it's like a retro console kind of colour scheme
[5153.70 → 5158.90] so this has got all the new improvements so it now has analog triggers and I think there were a couple
[5158.90 → 5165.54] of other little things that they tweaked but I am like super stoked on this sweet I love i absolutely
[5165.54 → 5173.94] love the colours yeah it's like ugly in all the right ways yeah 100 so uh I forget what else they
[5173.94 → 5181.38] changed about it but um so I'll definitely be using that until the steam deck arrives and who knows maybe
[5181.38 → 5186.42] after I don't know I still haven't daily driven a steam deck I don't know if the ergonomics that seemed
[5186.42 → 5193.22] good in my first hands-on are going to stay good I'm hoping I'm hoping it will because the performance of the
[5193.22 → 5198.18] steam deck looks like freaking awesome uh what's Conrad talking about they talked about that in
[5198.18 → 5203.14] a previous one show I don't remember right now okay I don't know yeah it looks freaking cool pen mail
[5203.14 → 5209.06] says love that sand colour yeah it looks awesome it looks freaking cool, and the texture is like really
[5209.06 → 5214.58] great uh what is that again question mark question mark it's the an in neo I don't even
[5214.58 → 5221.78] know if they have any stock I doubt it, it's like ridiculously hard to get your hands on like any good tech
[5221.78 → 5232.26] right now um let's see if they even have any stock oh I don't see this colour wait I don't know if it's
[5232.26 → 5241.46] like a special one for influencers or something again I don't see it on their site a neo retro oh no
[5241.46 → 5253.54] uh oh a neo 2021 pro oh wow so it has a docking station what is dark star oh light moon I think is
[5253.54 → 5260.98] the one that I've got yeah this is light moon Verizon 7 4800u one terabyte SSD I actually don't know the
[5260.98 → 5269.94] difference between the pro and um the other one this is maybe something to for me to just make a full video
[5269.94 → 5278.74] about because clearly I have not done any research uh maybe it's the 4500u in the main one
[5278.74 → 5287.86] people are like put steam OS 3.0 on it that would actually be super cool like the not steam
[5287.86 → 5296.50] deck steam deck yeah yeah that'd be amazing its interesting 16 gigs up to two terabytes okay so maybe
[5296.50 → 5305.06] that's it maybe it's just uh just better specs here all right cool um right what else was I going
[5305.06 → 5309.06] to talk about I mean I think that's I think that's pretty much it maybe we should talk some merch
[5309.06 → 5316.98] messages here real quick sure yeah let's do it uh we have been organizing them so you guys might have
[5316.98 → 5324.26] noticed a lot of them have been popping up uh popping up there but some of them haven't so if you
[5324.26 → 5329.86] sent one, and you were like uh what the heck happened it's possible it ended up in our curated queue
[5329.86 → 5336.42] yeah uh Naomi l solar-powered pool is definitely still going to happen uh johnny s long time watcher
[5336.42 → 5342.74] first time buyer any chance on a stealth desk pad yes that was the thing I was going to go leak okay so I'm
[5342.74 → 5345.86] going to go try and get one do you want to go through a few of these yeah all right
[5352.26 → 5355.86] john an uh bought a water bottle a shirt and a spout lid and said
[5357.62 → 5359.46] it's it has to do with the message
[5361.70 → 5367.62] and then he said uh needed a new water bottle since the yellow on my black and gold v1 completely worn
[5367.62 → 5373.54] away yeah it lasts for a while, but you know not forever that's part of the reason as far as my
[5373.54 → 5379.06] understanding goes I am so sorry if I'm totally wrong about this but I think the new versions have
[5379.06 → 5386.58] better printing I don't know I don't know I'm sorry that's not my department um moving on
[5386.58 → 5395.86] we've got some that we already oh these are archived messages that's why that's going on
[5395.86 → 5399.78] that makes sense okay sorry guys give me one second
[5408.18 → 5412.98] bought a beanie because I heard great things as well as a spout lid for my v1 water bottle
[5412.98 → 5417.70] had to get some shirts uh to offset shipping costs there you go I'm assuming it was shipped
[5417.70 → 5424.58] far away uh case says I needed a beanie for the winter and an amazing water bottle and a
[5425.22 → 5433.14] and well a shirt greetings from Germany PS wanted to link Linus uh some desolation tool he should get
[5433.14 → 5442.58] the strip backs from what the I can't say that uh weed Mueller I'm going to copy that and I'll
[5442.58 → 5448.50] show it to him later couldn't find the backpack uh it's yeah it's not a thing anymore so I had to
[5448.50 → 5454.34] improvise first time buying and already hating the taxes I'll have to pay this is a lot of things he got
[5454.34 → 5461.70] like uh everything GPU t-shirt Ethernet t-shirt reflective CPU t-shirt insulated water bottle
[5461.70 → 5467.22] reflective heat sink t-shirt party shirt insulated water bottle northern lights' desk pad another northern
[5467.22 → 5474.82] lights desk had CPU pillow and an abc's book of gaming g-burst um hey finally got around to
[5474.82 → 5480.26] ordering one of these bad boys by the way uh how would you say the name throne oh I think I did that
[5480.26 → 5486.82] one oh yeah I can't tell where I tried throne you tried throne isn't it throne I don't know I have no
[5486.82 → 5498.50] idea, so this oh is an upcoming stealth circuit board uh desk pad design so if you guys look kind of is it
[5498.50 → 5506.82] yeah no here do you want to take a side there we go ah so if you guys look closely you can kind of see
[5507.54 → 5514.34] I hope you can see in the as it reflects there's like a LTT logo in the middle and then like a
[5514.34 → 5518.10] circuit board in person you can definitely see it oh yeah I don't know how it's showing up on stream but
[5518.10 → 5522.82] you can yeah it's really hard to its subtle, but you can definitely see it yeah so it's uh
[5523.46 → 5530.02] yeah it's just meant to be kind of a more not so in your face has to match the colour of your
[5530.58 → 5539.30] of your setup kind of thing um that's definitely coming uh Brian says i kind of hate it not going to lie
[5539.30 → 5545.54] I mean yeah get a northern lights pad then get a northern lights pad solved so we've got we've got
[5545.54 → 5551.94] lots of different kind of stuff that we're working on, but you know for us, it's actually kind of a big
[5551.94 → 5560.34] commitment to do a new desk pad and the reason for that is that if we want to support our full size
[5560.34 → 5569.30] um that's a lot of choice yeahs we kind of have to be really sure that it's killer are you doing that
[5569.30 → 5575.38] are you supporting every size um like I wouldn't think you necessarily have to as long as the lights
[5575.38 → 5583.14] covers everything yeah I mean I don't know I'm torn I'm torn I'm I don't know I don't remember what we
[5583.14 → 5589.30] did for this so we'll see yeah yeah there's a lot of people that like it uh people like less branding
[5589.30 → 5594.18] would be nice so we actually thought of that uh the reason that the branding is on there is because
[5594.18 → 5598.74] we wanted kind of something to be LTT stealth about it, but that's right where your keyboard goes
[5599.70 → 5606.18] so you will actually never see the LTT logo and the other thing that's cool is that the circuit stuff
[5606.18 → 5610.18] if you want to hold it again for a second the circuit stuff kind of radiates out
[5610.18 → 5621.62] from your keyboard, so this is a very small keyboard so it's like that through like 10 kilos size so the
[5621.62 → 5627.06] idea is that it's kind of like your keyboard is the centrepiece of your setup with it that was
[5627.06 → 5632.42] the rationale behind why we did it that way because you will never have this anywhere where there will
[5632.42 → 5639.54] not be a keyboard uh someone says I have keyboard top left I mean that's good um you might want a
[5639.54 → 5647.62] different desk pad if you want to cover the logo the vast majority of people do not so uh it
[5647.62 → 5653.46] should be okay for most people uh there's only there's only so much we can do I mean maybe you
[5653.46 → 5658.74] have your keyboard glued under your desk for all I know maybe that's more ergonomic for you there's
[5658.74 → 5663.70] nothing I can do for you but um that was the rationale that was why we did that
[5663.70 → 5671.22] um iceberg says I like this much better but is there any chance of an even more stealth one i
[5671.22 → 5677.14] want the nice material but I just want plain black I mean you just want us to make like a plain black
[5677.14 → 5681.46] disk pad there's like a hundred plain I mean I guess you know what we did actually you know we did a
[5681.46 → 5688.82] custom thickness right like for all of them yeah yes yeah yeah yeah um because I was just like
[5688.82 → 5698.26] like no three millimetres is too thin and four millimetres is too thick, so the factory was just
[5698.26 → 5706.10] like what and the best part is this before is this before we had placed any kind of volume orders with
[5706.10 → 5712.26] them, so this is before we've like actually paid them like any meaningful amount of money they're just
[5712.26 → 5719.38] like okay but everything else is fine like yeah okay than you guys need to place your order and once
[5719.38 → 5725.78] you like place your order and put down a big deposit we will do a custom thickness of rubber for you
[5728.02 → 5736.66] that's pretty epic oh no yeah all right um are you at the curated merch messages because I think
[5736.66 → 5741.22] before you left you're reading from the wrong section uh I'm at the bottom of the curated merch messages
[5741.22 → 5745.78] okay so I'm reading from the bottom to the top okay yeah uh Brighton says my water bottle with a
[5745.78 → 5753.86] gold smear across it, I like it that way oh okay um I'm curious to know who my water bottle came with
[5753.86 → 5757.62] a gold smear across it, I like it that way it takes the stress out of accidentally dinging it but I'm
[5757.62 → 5764.98] curious to know who um you can contact support they will get you sorted out um overall the quality
[5764.98 → 5770.82] control on the water bottles is excellent we get very, very few uh complaints about that so that
[5770.82 → 5775.78] seems like a really odd one, but nothing's perfect uh Jim says can we ever expect a stealth mouse oh
[5776.34 → 5781.46] for crying out loud uh anonymous it would be really cool if the backpack had a waterproof pocket for the
[5781.46 → 5787.86] uh to prevent any leaks from getting to the expensive things inside so nothing is waterproof but
[5787.86 → 5794.58] the self material is fairly water-resistant, and we're using all water um like all sealed zippers on it
[5794.58 → 5800.50] so PKK uh water-resistant zippers if I could add some interpretation I think he means from your own things
[5800.82 → 5806.50] so like a water bottle leaking it would be cool if the outside so no, no it's oh wait I had a
[5806.50 → 5811.70] waterproof pocket for the backpack to prevent any leaks from getting oh uh you should just get an
[5811.70 → 5818.10] LTT store water bottle, so your water bottle doesn't leak hey hey hey I didn't even show this on this
[5818.10 → 5824.02] stream anyway, but it has a dedicated spot for your water bottle to sit so at the very least if your water
[5824.02 → 5829.78] bottle does leak um it shouldn't like fall over and get on anything because it shouldn't ever fall
[5829.78 → 5839.94] over sweet so that's cool uh also why is HDR over TV apps in float plane I have huh sorry also why is HDR
[5842.66 → 5849.38] oh like in terms of priority because TV apps are just a low priority because casting is a thing
[5849.38 → 5858.02] uh Linus needs to do a Vader impression say Luke I am your father which you now cannot do because
[5858.02 → 5868.34] that's not the quote what it's no I am your father yeah that's true actually um I'm so sorry JB
[5869.22 → 5876.42] happy birthday though yeah happy birthday uh Eric hey wan show long time viewer this is our special place
[5876.42 → 5883.30] where one may find audio products that have reached EOL or am I just sol looking for a set of uh one
[5883.30 → 5890.58] plus bullets wireless z and Sony WH h910 ends ebay is the answer and if you don't find it there
[5890.58 → 5898.26] honestly I wouldn't eBay and then buy new things foam pads or yeah ear inserts or whatever I mean not
[5898.26 → 5904.42] for those the bullets wireless are like in-ears, but yeah wouldn't they have little things though you
[5904.42 → 5911.94] can buy the gel end whatever it's called uh oh yes I doubt that's the problem though um do you think
[5911.94 → 5916.10] the upcoming steam OS and steam deck release will push NVIDIA to finally give a thought to Linux support
[5916.10 → 5923.86] no I don't think that NVIDIA works that hard at capturing that uh that game console business so
[5924.74 → 5929.54] maybe they just will continue to not care NVIDIA however has been doing more
[5929.54 → 5936.74] more recently I have no idea what the timeline is uh than they have in the more distant past for Linux
[5936.74 → 5943.46] stuff I believe that's fair but I don't think the steam deck is going to change anything about it nope
[5943.46 → 5952.18] don't think so especially because it's a steam deck you know this is funny um they're talking about the
[5952.18 → 5962.98] original LAN hoodie in the float plane chat uh yes you are correct the OG form of the LTT hoodie is
[5962.98 → 5971.22] actually this one if you get far enough back it's by g8, and it was the LAN hoodie and this was the
[5971.22 → 5978.74] garment that was the basis for the wan version of it, so there's the green inner hood we did an orange
[5978.74 → 5983.94] inner hood there's the NVIDIA logo with the splashy kind of design we did a wan logo with kind of
[5983.94 → 5988.34] splashy design, and we were up front about that just to be clear we talked about it all the
[5988.34 → 5995.14] time yeah we talked about how the reason the wan hoodie existed was because I got a LAN hoodie at an
[5995.14 → 6003.14] NVIDIA event and I really liked it, and it was like wearing out, and so I wanted more and NVIDIA didn't have
[6003.14 → 6010.10] any more left when I asked for one, and so I was like okay so what does it take to get more of these garments
[6011.30 → 6017.94] and what it took was a minimum order of however many hundreds of them so I did and I sold the rest
[6020.02 → 6026.42] awesome yeah literally how we got into doing custom merch was because I wanted a hoodie
[6026.42 → 6035.86] a hoodie oh no pretty awesome um NOX says when hoodie v1 with the gloves I want one yes I know
[6035.86 → 6042.02] they're like 120 still we don't have any more, and we have no meaningful way to make them
[6042.82 → 6048.66] uh Scott says if I'm eligible for a job with an offer master's degree should I say I am legally
[6048.66 → 6055.86] eligible on a Google form uh yes you should uh Seth have you considered making a question though yeah
[6055.86 → 6059.94] yeah on the Google form oh I'm not sure I don't think that's the question I think the question is
[6059.94 → 6064.58] like do you have a valid work permit or something yeah so no is the answer no the answer is
[6064.58 → 6071.70] probably still yes because if you have certain credentials getting that permit is like what
[6071.70 → 6078.18] he's saying is if is it's conditional upon me having a job offer should I say that yes and then the
[6078.18 → 6083.70] answer is yes because there are certain visas where you can just go okay if you have a job offer yeah
[6083.70 → 6090.10] it's just automatic yeah but if it's not, that then don't say you're eligible you yeah yes we are
[6090.10 → 6095.14] going to do a display port follow-up on the HDMI cable video absolutely thank you for the suggestion
[6096.58 → 6103.86] Ryan asks should I wait for dozen 6000 or buy the new i5 my 7700k is choking hard you should upgrade
[6103.86 → 6110.10] when it's time to upgrade because otherwise you will wait forever and if you upgrade when it's not time
[6110.10 → 6114.82] to upgrade then you are wasting money and contributing to additional e-waste so it's all
[6114.82 → 6119.22] about you should upgrade when you reach a point where you need to upgrade sounds like you got there
[6119.22 → 6127.30] time to upgrade that's the way it is uh Steven just found out Linus is a biker what bike do you have sv650s
[6127.30 → 6133.22] it's a 2003 also Fortnite oh Fortnite is the best YouTube motorcycle channel if you haven't heard of it
[6133.22 → 6140.42] something to Fortnite okay cool thank you Chris s says will float plane get Samsung fold support like
[6140.42 → 6147.94] laptop mode or the screen i half folded the screen i half folded and audio play while phone is locked
[6147.94 → 6157.70] screen is half folded so here I can show it to you on uh on Plex um so basically what it does is it puts
[6157.70 → 6163.06] it's it lets you just like sit it on something, and then you've got like controls on the bottom and
[6163.06 → 6167.78] then it just plays in a window up here so you can just like prop it up I believe that's something that
[6167.78 → 6172.58] you can actually force support for in a menu somewhere because I don't think Plex supported it natively
[6172.58 → 6179.22] either but I haven't actually touched it since I first looked at it uh we are going to get like
[6179.22 → 6185.70] background audio and stuff working um something that's something Jaden is working on yeah sorry I don't
[6186.34 → 6191.62] I don't remember full screen apps no I don't remember uh yeah I don't know if that's something
[6191.62 → 6198.82] that we're specifically planning right now though yeah well it's not Jonathan asks I'm visually impaired
[6198.82 → 6202.74] and the merch message section of the checkout is a very tiny checkbox could we make it more visible
[6202.74 → 6208.26] can we do that is that like a theme limitation right now or is that something we could do I'm
[6208.82 → 6213.54] Conrad's in the chat so he can probably say okay but I think he's using default things right now but we
[6213.54 → 6217.46] might be able to make something okay if there's any way for us to do that that would be super cool
[6218.82 → 6222.74] uh Nate a few ban shows ago you talked about the importance of having external storage for data
[6222.74 → 6228.02] backup would you ever do a vid on how to take used slash old slash eBay parts and make a NAS at home
[6228.02 → 6233.70] that video is in progress right now Colin is working on it so yes, yes we are
[6235.70 → 6240.34] anonymous asks is there an alternative method to apply for leg jobs I requested the application package a
[6240.34 → 6245.70] week ago and have not received it is this expected uh if you didn't receive it that would seem to
[6245.70 → 6250.82] indicate that for whatever reason you were not eligible to apply that's one of the reasons that
[6250.82 → 6259.86] we have that questionnaire to get the package because we can't go through 10 000 20 000 applications so we
[6259.86 → 6268.02] have filtering surveys in order to help us avoid wasting your time and ours so we're not going to tell you
[6268.02 → 6275.70] what the right answers are, but there are no everyone gets an application package because we
[6275.70 → 6282.34] we do not have the hr grunt to go through I also wouldn't necessarily take this as a
[6283.54 → 6289.78] confirm that you're not going to get one yet yeah uh not every position has sent out the packages because
[6290.42 → 6296.10] we haven't finished taking in applicants for some of the positions so yeah sorry go ratchet 766
[6298.02 → 6305.70] uh okay let's go ahead and get rid of that uh go ahead and get rid of that okay Emmanuel says i
[6305.70 → 6309.86] like to roll the dice I know builds aren't exactly popular these days but I'd love to see more content
[6309.86 → 6319.62] on small form factor setups it's tough how are we supposed to do a video on any gaming pc when as we saw
[6319.62 → 6324.02] you can't build a gaming pc like it's tough
[6327.30 → 6334.26] i I do not envy the LTT content team right now it that's a hard life and yes Emmanuel Reilly is
[6334.26 → 6342.26] awesome yeah Joshua says did you hear the makers uh did you hear canonical excuse me uh man I'm getting
[6342.26 → 6347.62] very tired I is now collecting feedback on the Linux gaming experience that's really cool that is cool i
[6347.62 → 6354.34] did not hear about that yet another positive even if you're upset uh yet another positive impact of
[6354.34 → 6359.30] the gaming on Linux challenge, or maybe they were going to do it anyway, but it certainly started a
[6359.30 → 6365.06] conversation also float theatre mode when uh it's coming actually theoretically very soon the
[6365.06 → 6371.70] developer working on it uh there was an accident that happened at their house where their main laptop
[6371.70 → 6378.66] uh the power cord was had a well someone had a bit of a tripping accident over the power cord
[6378.66 → 6384.42] and it was a version of a macBook that did not have MagSafe it was not it was not them it was someone else
[6384.42 → 6392.02] but so that laptop went absolute kaput um they have replaced said device and are back up to speed but there
[6392.02 → 6396.82] was a little bit of a hiccup there unfortunately, but it's actually like very close um all right and
[6396.82 → 6399.94] there's a whole new player coming, and it's going to be great and things are going to be cool but
[6400.66 → 6406.74] oh man Matthew just got my party shirt absolutely love it exclamation mark are there any plans for
[6406.74 → 6414.26] more patterns to be honest no uh we did not plan any more patterns because I was a bit of a hater
[6414.26 → 6423.54] on the party shirt project I underestimated hugely how big that that launch was going to be
[6423.54 → 6430.74] um turns out just because I'm allergic to button up shirts doesn't mean that everyone is so that's
[6430.74 → 6435.86] good to know there's a whole wide world of people with preferences that are not mine um which is great
[6436.66 → 6442.58] so i i i initially oh I mean i barely greenlet the project at all to be honest with you
[6443.46 → 6448.10] the finished garment is so much better than the early samples that we had that I based that decision
[6448.10 → 6454.10] on like it's super comfortable have you tried it on no okay it's like a really you know don't really
[6454.10 → 6458.18] do the whole fair enough yeah it's a really nice fabric though if you absolutely have to wear a
[6458.18 → 6466.66] button-up shirt I can understand why people are buying it um but yeah so the fact that it barely got
[6466.66 → 6471.94] greenlet at all would indicate that no the plan was not for more patterns now that it is so successful
[6471.94 → 6480.02] it um it's not unlikely that we would do more patterns it's its honestly just not something
[6480.02 → 6484.90] we've talked about at all though so no promises thanks for being awesome Linus love the show hope
[6484.90 → 6491.94] I get these bottles in time for Christmas tall shirts when Luke uh can you tell us something interesting
[6493.06 → 6497.30] wow really you're you can think about that while I discuss tall shirts because they're really putting
[6497.30 → 6505.86] you on the spot here uh tall shirts are coming so we actually just did an uh an early print on one of
[6505.86 → 6511.54] our first blank hoodies so we have had a heck of a time finding a hoodie that we were happy with that's
[6511.54 → 6517.54] just blank that we can just print graphics on the front so no, no zip no like uh does it have kangaroo
[6517.54 → 6526.50] pockets I don't think any no kangaroo pocket um so we finally have those we also have our blank shirts
[6526.50 → 6531.86] so you're going to see a coloured t-shirt from LTT store for the first time in like two years or
[6531.86 → 6537.22] something like that we're really excited about it, but we want to see some of those shirts go out into
[6537.22 → 6543.62] the wild make sure that they're holding up make sure the QC is acceptable and make sure that like not
[6543.62 → 6549.38] just the q the initial QC but the quality of the ones that are out in the wild are good when we get that
[6549.38 → 6556.34] back it'll be time like that information back it'll be time for us to work on our we're going to call
[6556.34 → 6565.06] it is lanky boy um thick boy um, and then we're going to have describing things in those terms for female
[6565.06 → 6571.70] clothing probably isn't very 2021 right um I mean maybe we'll just do it anyway lanky girl thick
[6571.70 → 6578.58] girl I don't know I mean if we're I don't know what is equal I don't know I don't know I don't
[6578.58 → 6583.62] know I don't make the rules for any of this so I just figure out what they are and then do my best to
[6583.62 → 6590.42] you know would curvy be better I genuinely have no idea I have no idea I have no I just have no
[6590.42 → 6596.26] idea to offboard off of that and go back to the previous comment yeah interesting fact uh a notable
[6596.26 → 6603.70] predator of the moose if you've is you've heard of moose before they're they're gigantic um and they
[6603.70 → 6611.30] walk on land a notable predator of the moose is a killer whale huh okay thank you that's a weird fact
[6611.30 → 6617.06] yeah it really is yeah uh Robert h bought one of everything I've been watching uh glad to be able
[6617.06 → 6620.90] to contribute to you guys how big is the leg team now I think we're up to somewhere in the neighbourhood
[6620.90 → 6631.38] of 50 to 55 across just leg I don't know anymore I'm so sorry I think no I think we're over 60
[6631.38 → 6636.58] because I think that doesn't include float plane oh yeah does that include credit warehouse uh
[6637.22 → 6645.06] include I'm sorry I just have no idea yeah no worries um yeah so it's at the point now where
[6645.06 → 6648.66] even with my team people are like how many people do you have and I'm like uh
[6650.10 → 6654.90] well you don't see them every day either that's true so many of them are remote yeah let me put it this
[6654.90 → 6664.18] way lab one is not the only acquisition we made oh my yeah we're taking possession oh also by the
[6664.18 → 6671.38] way i um glossed over that is to say glossed over some details which is to say that I outright lied
[6671.38 → 6677.86] about some of the aspects of the lab one introduction video like I said that Luke would be working in that
[6677.86 → 6686.42] room that was never actually my intention um Luke might but float planes office would probably be in
[6686.42 → 6692.42] the other acquisition which will probably end up with some lab space in it as well I just wanted
[6692.42 → 6698.58] for the sake of it made a lot more sense for the flow of the video for the flow of the video I was like
[6698.58 → 6703.94] so he's going to go here but the main reason to talk about Luke was to talk about how we understand that
[6703.94 → 6710.58] software and development is going to be a big aspect of running this lab not because literally
[6710.58 → 6715.14] the float plane team was going to be sitting in that room even though we like meted on the walls
[6715.14 → 6721.06] and stuff yeah because the float plane team those that are local are I mean okay we've got our app
[6721.06 → 6727.22] developer who would not have anything to do with labs nope uh we've got Luke who's managing it like it's
[6729.30 → 6733.38] putting float plane there would be just taking up lab space that we could use for more lab equipment
[6733.94 → 6737.54] want to say what you might actually put there because that's somewhat interesting yeah so what
[6737.54 → 6745.38] I'm actually planning to put there is a small like home theatre lab so somewhere that we could use as
[6745.38 → 6750.42] a light controlled environment for testing projectors uh somewhere that we could use as a sound control
[6750.42 → 6758.18] somewhat controlled not controlled but like sound treated environment for um evaluating sound bars so
[6758.18 → 6762.18] we'd have to figure out okay we're going to put some we're going to stuff some insulation up into the t-bar like
[6762.18 → 6768.66] uh figuring out a way to kind of turn it into a basic home theatre um so we can look at things
[6768.66 → 6774.10] like um you know virtual ceiling speakers and stuff like that so get like a microphone array that's what
[6774.10 → 6784.58] I'm actually planning to put there um so yeah and the reason lab one is called lab one is that it's one
[6784.58 → 6793.78] uh whoa hold on a second also 10k with this cash flow seems like pennies 10k is not pennies what is
[6793.78 → 6801.14] the context of this oh someone wants to invest uh ten thousand dollars into leg is that an option so we
[6801.14 → 6810.58] are not taking any outside investment at this time and the reason is that i just um I like to do things my way
[6810.58 → 6817.62] way which sometimes involves spending inordinate amounts of money on things that don't really have
[6817.62 → 6822.50] a proven business case we don't have a proven business case for LTT labs if we had a board of
[6822.50 → 6828.58] directors that was anyone other than me and Yvonne where you know Yvonne and I have this vibe right like
[6829.14 → 6836.26] she i have the vision and sometimes the vision is literally like a vision like I wake up in
[6836.26 → 6841.94] the middle of the night I'm like oh i have to write this down like I'll just like to have an idea um and
[6841.94 → 6849.62] then she makes the vision happen we've got we've got both parts of the puzzle and that is the that is
[6849.62 → 6856.18] the entire ownership structure of Linus media group I've always kind of seen it as like there's the there's
[6856.18 → 6862.50] the rocket thruster but if you just take that you don't put any wings on it or any flight control
[6862.50 → 6869.22] it's not going to work that great but if you if you control it name it properly then it's
[6869.22 → 6873.46] fantastic it's powerful and you kind of your kind of need both because all that power with yeah yeah
[6873.46 → 6880.18] anyway yeah i um that's so funny oh you don't want stock you just want to like help fund and
[6880.18 → 6887.14] encourage the shenanigans you know what I believe firmly that we should always give something back
[6887.14 → 6895.86] anytime you give us money so you should absolutely like buy merch yeah um but I'm not
[6895.86 → 6901.22] gonna I'm not gonna just take your money I can't do that so that that's where I'm at on that and if
[6901.22 → 6906.34] you want to do something big like that just like sub to float plane at the 4k tier buy more stuff from
[6906.34 → 6911.70] merch later if you want a different t-shirt or if we release socks or the backpack or whatever and just
[6911.70 → 6918.10] like stay in the loop PJ lee says can't things be structured so that the shares are non-voting
[6918.10 → 6923.54] sure but then what's in it for you why are you investing, and the answer can't just be because
[6923.54 → 6928.50] you want to be a bro and like help me out or whatever because that's the way I think about
[6928.50 → 6934.90] every business transaction is that I have to consider it from both sides because unless I can
[6934.90 → 6942.10] figure out what's in it for you, it shouldn't happen if i because either it's a bad deal for you and that
[6942.10 → 6949.06] sucks so we're not going to do that or I don't understand your deal yeah in which case I feel
[6949.06 → 6954.58] like there's an opportunity for me to be taken advantage of i must understand both sides of the
[6954.58 → 6964.02] deal or I can't sing it is a policy of mine for life um so i just uh unless there's something in
[6964.02 → 6969.46] it for you, I couldn't do it and because my intention is not to go public and because my intention
[6970.02 → 6976.66] is not to sell Linus media group to the highest corporate bidder there's no there's no end game for
[6976.66 → 6981.62] you what's your exit strategy there's nothing and if I really wanted a loan we're at the point now
[6981.62 → 6986.42] where our business performance is so strong over such an extended period of time that if we really need
[6986.42 → 6995.06] a loan we can get one so if I need money I will just do it like that and if the idea is like a big
[6995.06 → 7001.62] moonshot payout then this is not the place to be right so that's where that's where I'm at on that
[7001.62 → 7013.54] that's why for now we have no we have no um yeah we have no intention of exploring that
[7014.50 → 7019.62] uh curated messages are we almost done the curated messages yeah, but there's like a bunch
[7019.62 → 7025.38] wow look at that incoming section oh bloody hell okay um okay, okay we can only do a few more so
[7025.38 → 7031.70] I'm going to surprise my dad with some tech stuff nice will you look at the camera and say merry
[7031.70 → 7040.10] Christmas and have a happy new year I think is the timing I don't know what the timing is so good
[7040.10 → 7048.10] luck everybody um someone said is this thing censored f yeah water bottle uh it is censored by us deciding
[7048.10 → 7054.26] if it shows up on screen or not so it's censored yes yeah see you later uh George f been watching
[7054.26 → 7060.02] since the house water cooling I have a 3070 ti and my display doesn't wake after sleep oh man I had
[7060.02 → 7068.34] this problem too with my NVIDIA card what did I do um okay you have to search for uh there's a there's a
[7068.34 → 7073.54] there's a stupid command prompt thing that you can use there's a command you can use to check what
[7073.54 → 7079.46] is keeping your pc from uh oh wait oh shoot no issue was my display wasn't going to sleep
[7079.46 → 7083.94] my display doesn't wake after sleep I have to reset it to get it to work again no i
[7083.94 → 7089.70] I have not personally fixed that one I've only done it the other way on Linux but not on Windows so
[7090.34 → 7095.54] I mean you should definitely try doing a full reinstallation of your drivers so you're going to want
[7095.54 → 7102.34] to go and uh like fully uh CDU them go in safe mode CDU them reinstall them if that doesn't fix it
[7102.34 → 7106.82] one thing you could start to tinker around with is sleep states in your bios I had an issue with my
[7106.82 → 7110.98] thread ripper machine in my office which I was very disappointed about it was just crashing like
[7110.98 → 7116.10] just randomly when I wasn't doing anything, and it turns out that I was able to fix it by just um
[7116.10 → 7122.90] adjusting my lowest sleep state up one in the bios, and then it just is perfect now yeah so maybe try
[7122.90 → 7130.90] not letting it go as to sleep uh nick allows says uh any info on flow plane app crashing when not using
[7130.90 → 7139.62] google apps we know that that's like a thing but the amount of users that we have that are on android
[7139.62 → 7146.90] and aren't using google apps is like real low, so there are some other major things in terms of the
[7146.90 → 7151.70] app that we are currently working on we actually rolled out a version this week um I don't know if
[7151.70 → 7157.94] it's at 100 rollouts yet so you might not have access to it but maybe try that version maybe that'll help
[7157.94 → 7160.98] um cool don't know
[7164.18 → 7171.22] what's the uh man i feel my energy dying okay uh thanks Alexander b you know merry Christmas to
[7171.22 → 7175.94] your son I think we're good I don't think there's going to be any ROK float plane app anytime soon
[7176.74 → 7182.82] um save me from Bezos I can't IAN I'm sorry there's nothing I can do uh thanks Chris p
[7182.82 → 7190.42] new grandpa says mark h need to start a grandchild on gaming early got the ABCs of gaming absolutely
[7190.42 → 7197.62] love it, and you'd already do nick laws's, and he plans for Lt team mugs yeah, so mugs are one of those
[7197.62 → 7204.02] ones that i just on principle kind of avoided for the longest time because it just felt like we weren't
[7204.02 → 7209.46] really contributing anything like the world is full of so many mugs you know like if you just go to a
[7209.46 → 7216.34] thrift store and just like go rescue a bunch of mugs from the landfill is sort of the way that
[7216.34 → 7221.06] I've always felt about it um like insulated water bottles were something I was totally comfortable
[7221.06 → 7226.50] with because a're super on brand for me, I love drinking my ice-cold water that's just like my
[7226.50 → 7231.46] thing always been a thing that's what I drink um and so just it's something that I personally need
[7231.46 → 7236.74] it I mean that's the that's the genesis of so many of our merch items it's like I need, I mean that's
[7236.74 → 7240.98] where this one came from I want a beanie I need a jacket I need a jacket
[7243.62 → 7252.10] so what could I say and i I don't use mugs so like there was no it's always what's my pain point
[7252.10 → 7257.54] right because it's not just I need any jacket it's like I need a jacket that's exactly the way that i
[7257.54 → 7265.38] like a jacket to be so I don't have a preference for mugs so I just don't really care about them
[7265.38 → 7270.34] um, and you know you go to a thrift store you can get a mug for like a dollar, and it'll probably like
[7270.34 → 7275.86] say something funny on it or whatever so I'm not saying no I'm just saying it's been extremely
[7276.50 → 7284.90] low priority yeah it's where I'm at on that um nice thanks anonymous for the message on the thing
[7284.90 → 7290.98] okay I think we're going to call it here yeah I think we're thanked you so much ladies and gentlemen
[7290.98 → 7298.58] and everything in between we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[7298.58 → 7306.18] bye
[7308.18 → 7316.26] I love that the merch message portion of the show is now officially a bit it's officially a
[7318.18 → 7324.74] ramping up viewership portion of the show people are super into it when we used to do super chats
[7324.74 → 7331.54] no one cares that's fascinating yeah by the way the super chat problem that I've had is still
[7331.54 → 7337.06] there so if you sent a super chat during the show in fact I can see I can see that there are super
[7337.06 → 7343.30] chats here, but there's nothing in here YouTube is apparently working on a fix for me, I have no idea
[7343.30 → 7348.42] why the fix is for me and not just for the platform because this has been a problem for months
[7348.42 → 7354.02] um it's probably because they want you to stop so just a reminder guys let people know in the chat
[7354.74 → 7361.22] don't use super chats because if I don't specifically click this and then never refresh the page
[7361.78 → 7367.38] they're just gone they're gone forever I have no way of knowing oh okay apparently I can click these
[7368.34 → 7374.26] okay oh it only goes over so far genius I'm clicking this arrow, and it's not going over more even
[7374.26 → 7381.22] though I can see there are more messages oh fantastic all right well hey thanks guys um
[7382.82 → 7387.86] yes there are inverted cases I think Silverstone has one oh it's not scrolling left anymore now
[7389.94 → 7395.70] unbelievable i do love how Conrad's
