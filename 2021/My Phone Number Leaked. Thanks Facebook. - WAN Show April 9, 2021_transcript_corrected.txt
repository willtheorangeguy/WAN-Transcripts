[0.00 → 6.04] Okay, it takes a second to resume selected ladies and gentlemen.
[6.64 → 11.36] Why so late? Because YouTube videos, okay? They're important. You want them. You watch them.
[11.46 → 13.62] They're probably why you're here. Don't worry about it.
[13.64 → 18.62] Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen. We've got a fantastic show for you all today.
[18.74 → 24.52] And you know how you know it's going to be fantastic? Look at the image quality of this guy.
[24.52 → 35.60] Okay, that's right. Luke finally took the camera that he has owned all this time and pointed it at his face instead of using a Garbo trash one.
[35.76 → 38.28] Great job. Great job, Luke.
[38.72 → 39.94] This thing has been retired.
[40.32 → 43.52] See you later. And I've got some other good news.
[43.52 → 57.04] Now, the video title says my phone number was leaked, but it doesn't strictly speak say who me is.
[57.16 → 58.78] In this case, me is Luke.
[58.98 → 63.94] I actually did manage to dodge the bullet here, but Luke did not.
[63.94 → 73.74] So he, along with 533 other million people, had his user information leaked by Facebook.
[74.14 → 79.94] In other big important news, Intel is already dropping prices on their Rocket Lake CPUs.
[80.92 → 82.94] Ruhr. What else we got today, Luke?
[83.28 → 86.94] There's some Pixel Watch leaks, which is interesting.
[87.22 → 87.96] And LG.
[88.32 → 89.42] Is it interesting, Luke?
[89.80 → 91.06] Luke, is it interesting?
[91.64 → 92.22] Do you care?
[92.22 → 94.90] Are you interested? Because I don't know if I'm interested.
[95.84 → 99.86] I haven't seen the leak yet. I guess that'll determine about whether I'm interested.
[100.16 → 104.74] But something I am not interested in is that LG is out of the phone business.
[105.10 → 106.70] Well, you're not interested in that?
[107.42 → 114.24] Are you drinking the RATERATE on LG's contributions to the mobile phone space, Luke?
[114.84 → 118.64] Lately, yes. Long term. No, they added some cool stuff.
[118.72 → 120.20] Weren't they the first one to have the back?
[120.20 → 121.40] The button on the back?
[121.40 → 122.82] I believe they were. Yes, I do.
[122.82 → 127.50] That was actually super cool. I was a very early adopter of that. I loved that. Furthermore, I love it now. Furthermore, I love it then.
[128.42 → 132.58] But I don't remember the last time they did something that I thought was actually cool. It's been a long time.
[132.76 → 136.12] All right. Well, we'll talk about that a little bit more after we roll that intro.
[136.12 → 160.12] The show is brought to you today by...
[160.12 → 163.12] Sponsors.
[163.82 → 165.66] Check that real quick. One moment, please.
[165.74 → 166.32] Cloud Linux.
[167.04 → 170.36] See Sonic and private internet access.
[170.70 → 173.98] That's right. You got to access that internet from your privates.
[174.68 → 175.52] Wait. No.
[175.74 → 176.32] That's not.
[176.42 → 177.02] That's not.
[177.02 → 182.36] Okay. Moving on to our first topic, our headline topic.
[183.10 → 187.30] 533 million Facebook user records were leaked.
[187.90 → 189.22] And this is in the headline.
[189.36 → 193.28] I don't know who created this topic this week, but they put this in the headline.
[193.72 → 194.56] Leaked for free.
[195.76 → 196.22] So, Luke...
[196.22 → 200.18] Usually when user data leaks, everyone has to pay for it like a vending machine.
[200.18 → 210.26] Well, no. But okay, Luke, give us some hacker culture sort of context for why it's notable that this information leaked for free.
[210.76 → 218.64] Oh, yeah. It's pretty common that if you get a giant data set like this, especially with the girth that this data set has,
[218.76 → 222.00] that you might try to put it up for auction or something like that.
[222.04 → 226.16] You might try to sell it dark web style, get some Bitcoin or something for it.
[226.16 → 229.06] So, it is a little bit surprising.
[229.26 → 234.58] It's not crazy surprising just because there are a lot of leaks that just get dumped on the internet.
[235.06 → 239.02] It's a little bit surprising because of just how much data is here.
[239.14 → 242.16] 533 million Facebook user records is a lot.
[243.50 → 246.20] It's not credit card info or anything like that.
[246.26 → 249.42] It's mostly name and phone number as far as my understanding goes.
[249.42 → 256.54] I guess full names, locations, phone numbers, birthdays, email addresses and relationship statuses.
[256.68 → 258.46] For some people, that stuff's a little bit more public.
[258.58 → 259.46] For some people, it's not.
[260.90 → 262.42] It's not...
[263.88 → 265.50] Yeah, yeah.
[265.70 → 268.16] It is a little bit surprising that it immediately went out for free.
[268.48 → 272.80] And the thing too, the thing to remember is that even though unlike credit card information,
[272.80 → 277.74] which obviously no hacking group is going to leak for nothing,
[278.34 → 280.30] in those cases, you would be expected...
[280.30 → 283.40] In fact, you probably wouldn't even be able to pay for the whole data set.
[283.76 → 287.76] They would probably take chunks and auction them off a little bit at a time,
[288.02 → 293.00] try to build some momentum around it because once the first chunk goes, and it's confirmed,
[293.14 → 294.94] hey, this is like the good shit,
[295.16 → 301.40] the other ones would start to go up in price as they realize what a treasure trove it is, right?
[301.40 → 303.64] So that's a bit of a different situation.
[304.58 → 309.14] But this still has information that could be extremely problematic
[309.14 → 315.36] because remember, guys, one of the main reasons that people will steal your mail, for example,
[315.66 → 318.78] it's not because they want your bills so bad.
[318.84 → 320.34] They want to pay that cable bill.
[320.46 → 321.54] Luke, Luke.
[321.96 → 322.84] Hey, Luke, after stream.
[322.84 → 323.26] That'd be great.
[323.52 → 325.54] Can I pay your cable bill for you?
[326.38 → 326.90] Absolutely.
[328.24 → 331.38] Unfortunately, I do have to tell you, I don't have one.
[331.40 → 334.48] Are you cord cutting tonight?
[337.86 → 339.06] Oh my goodness.
[339.94 → 343.10] Nobody steals your mail because they want to pay your bills
[343.10 → 347.02] or honestly even read postcards that people wrote to you
[347.02 → 348.50] because they don't know what year it is.
[348.50 → 355.28] Really what it's about is stealing information that they can use to assume your identity
[355.28 → 363.86] and take out new credit cards or in some cases even much more substantial things like mortgages in your name.
[363.86 → 370.28] And in a lot of cases, having information like your phone number can enable certain attacks
[370.28 → 376.30] like SIM swapping, for example, where they try to get a SIM issued to them, to their person,
[376.80 → 379.98] but in your name and under your account using social engineering.
[379.98 → 385.90] Having information like a birthday or relationship status.
[385.90 → 393.06] That could tell them a lot about what they need to know to start digging into what kind of pins you might use for products.
[393.28 → 394.84] Or even just basic social engineering.
[395.06 → 402.72] Like there's a lot of phone operators or in-store operators that don't want the confrontation
[402.72 → 406.34] of being like you are not the person you're saying you are.
[406.64 → 406.76] Yeah.
[407.44 → 411.60] So if you can give them basically anything, they'll just fold,
[412.06 → 414.54] which is the whole idea behind social engineering.
[414.86 → 416.56] So having any of that information can help.
[416.56 → 419.24] Once you're validated with a phone operator,
[419.36 → 425.44] whether it's with a mobile phone provider or a bank or whatever else the case may be,
[425.90 → 430.00] in a lot of cases, they can do almost anything.
[430.00 → 433.90] Like for example, when you're setting a new pin for your bank card,
[434.24 → 438.50] once they're validated with you, it's not like they can set the pin for you,
[438.64 → 444.46] but they have the authorization to put you into the automated system where you set your new pin.
[444.94 → 450.58] And if people have things like your name, location, phone number, and birthday,
[450.86 → 455.32] all of a sudden they know where to steal documents and additional records from.
[455.32 → 461.54] They have enough basic information that they could kind of flub their way through pretending to be you.
[462.12 → 471.66] And it opens up the opportunity for folks who are professionals at this stuff to attack you in a variety of ways.
[472.02 → 477.66] So even though this wasn't like an outright financial information leak,
[477.74 → 481.16] it is still an extremely dangerous one.
[481.16 → 484.00] Now what didn't leak was passwords.
[484.42 → 488.74] So thankfully nobody has your Facebook password because you're a big dumdum
[488.74 → 490.72] and you use your Facebook password for everything.
[491.28 → 492.24] So that's good.
[492.54 → 494.72] No financial info, no health info.
[494.84 → 495.52] By the way, I'm just kidding.
[495.60 → 498.40] I know you guys are not dumdums who use the same passwords for things.
[498.46 → 499.44] I just mean people who do.
[500.12 → 504.54] And not everyone had all of these parameters leaked.
[504.54 → 508.84] So Facebook says the data was obtained during a breach in 2019.
[509.42 → 510.68] They said this is old data.
[510.78 → 512.38] It was previously reported on in 2019.
[512.38 → 515.94] We found and fixed the issue in August 2019.
[516.34 → 522.42] And the hackers were scraping profiles using a vulnerability in the platform's tool for syncing contacts.
[523.22 → 527.76] Facebook has not notified the affected users, which I think is fascinating.
[527.82 → 528.40] That's garbage.
[528.76 → 530.46] And does not plan to.
[530.84 → 533.06] And their rationale, oh, this is great.
[533.06 → 540.98] I actually am just getting to this point in the doc where I had already gone through all the terrible things that you can do with this information.
[542.00 → 547.08] Facebook's rationale is, one, you can't do anything with that information.
[547.68 → 550.92] And two, that data is publicly available.
[551.20 → 553.74] Okay, I got information for you, Facebook.
[554.44 → 559.50] One, you can do tons of stuff with that information, as I already outlined.
[559.50 → 564.16] And number two, not all that data is publicly available.
[564.88 → 567.34] Your website has these things called privacy settings.
[567.48 → 568.12] They're pretty neat.
[568.18 → 570.14] You might want to go check them out and see what they do sometimes.
[570.14 → 571.34] It's your own website.
[572.06 → 576.56] I know in your view, nobody should enable any privacy settings.
[577.02 → 578.20] But some people do.
[578.40 → 579.44] Lots of people do.
[579.68 → 581.52] And this is crazy.
[581.88 → 583.12] You're not going to believe this.
[583.12 → 585.54] They do it for a reason.
[586.80 → 587.32] Whoa.
[587.78 → 589.60] It's because, wait, hold on.
[590.14 → 594.92] They don't want that information to be publicly available.
[599.30 → 600.30] It's pretty bonkers.
[600.36 → 600.60] Right?
[601.34 → 602.14] Can you imagine?
[602.60 → 603.72] I can't imagine.
[604.52 → 605.82] I mean, my info's out there, right?
[605.86 → 606.64] My info's public.
[606.78 → 607.24] They're right.
[607.24 → 613.18] Now, even if this happened in August 2019, Facebook was supposed to report it to the FTC
[613.18 → 615.26] as per their July 2020 settlement.
[616.12 → 622.32] And I guess they just thought that didn't really matter because they have enough billions
[622.32 → 627.86] of dollars that whatever fine they could possibly get and however many people could possibly,
[628.14 → 632.54] you know, unsubscribe from their service and just delete their profiles off Facebook
[632.54 → 634.40] couldn't possibly affect them.
[634.46 → 636.50] I mean, we've seen it time and time again.
[636.50 → 640.72] People just seem to be numb to these kinds of data leaks now.
[640.86 → 642.58] Like, it just doesn't seem to...
[642.58 → 645.90] I mean, we even see it when we try to report on this stuff.
[646.52 → 647.36] We...
[647.36 → 650.50] The reason that this video has such a click...
[651.02 → 653.66] I'm not going to call it clickbait because it's true.
[653.84 → 654.88] I didn't bait you.
[656.02 → 657.22] The title is...
[657.22 → 658.84] What's the title of this video?
[659.18 → 660.40] My phone number leaked.
[660.52 → 661.16] Thanks, Facebook.
[661.42 → 664.40] So if you look at the thumbnail, my could be me.
[664.50 → 665.18] It could be Luke.
[665.24 → 666.26] In this case, it was Luke.
[666.26 → 667.36] Luke's phone number did leak.
[667.58 → 669.04] And thanks a lot, Facebook.
[669.20 → 672.82] So I won't call it clickbait, but it's definitely a cliquey title.
[672.98 → 679.48] And the reason that I did that is because if I put big data leak, watch out in the video
[679.48 → 680.98] title, or if I put...
[680.98 → 681.68] I'm going to care.
[682.04 → 684.86] If I put, yeah, protect your online privacy.
[684.86 → 687.14] I might as well.
[687.14 → 690.70] I might as well just put, please don't watch this.
[690.82 → 691.42] Honestly, no.
[691.58 → 696.48] If I put, please don't watch this video in the title of the video, it would perform better
[696.48 → 702.32] than if I put anything about data breaches or online safety or insecurity, because people
[702.32 → 704.70] just seem to not care.
[704.70 → 712.26] And I don't understand why they don't care, but they don't at all.
[712.40 → 716.18] And this leak is absolutely wild.
[716.38 → 717.06] It's enormous.
[717.30 → 720.36] It's affected so many people that I know personally already.
[720.36 → 721.74] Like 533 million.
[721.84 → 726.60] Guys, let's not be, let's not be numb to how big a number that is.
[727.86 → 732.84] 533 million is a lot more than a typical data leak.
[733.34 → 736.38] That's, it's like one ninth of the hold on.
[736.46 → 737.14] Let me do the map.
[737.20 → 739.78] Like one 20th of the planet or something stupid like that.
[739.82 → 741.28] One 18th, whatever it works out to.
[741.30 → 742.76] How many billions of people live on earth now?
[742.80 → 743.46] Is it seven or eight?
[744.22 → 745.62] I thought it was eight, but.
[745.62 → 749.34] So it's like a 14th or a 16th, somewhere in that neighbourhood.
[750.36 → 753.02] 7.674.
[753.08 → 753.38] All right.
[753.44 → 754.04] So I'm in good shape there.
[754.04 → 754.46] I'm in the middle.
[754.72 → 754.84] Yep.
[756.40 → 757.10] All right.
[757.80 → 762.66] In other less horrible news, sort of, unless you're Intel.
[763.14 → 767.90] Intel is already dropping prices for their Rocket Lake processors.
[769.36 → 772.54] This is a bit of a womp moment.
[772.54 → 777.54] And this is in spite of the fact that AMD can't even manage to keep their top tier processors
[777.54 → 782.68] that Rocket Lake was supposedly supposed to compete with in stock.
[782.90 → 789.16] So let's, let's just validate that real quick because AMD has actually been improving CPU
[789.16 → 791.72] availability over the last little while.
[791.84 → 796.74] You can tell really our barometer is usually what it's going for used on eBay.
[797.24 → 801.48] Like that tells you how far out of whack supply and demand are.
[801.48 → 807.72] Now 5900Xs, those are still hard to come by unless you participated in the verified actual
[807.72 → 810.26] gamer program drop that we did yesterday.
[810.50 → 816.36] 300 of those went to verified actual gamers over the course of the hour after the video
[816.36 → 816.76] launched.
[816.84 → 817.62] So that was incredible.
[818.48 → 821.48] 5,950 is not a thing basically.
[822.48 → 825.00] And 5,800X is actually on promo.
[825.00 → 829.92] So this might explain why Intel is in dire straits here.
[829.98 → 835.28] Because while AMD can't make enough of their 12 core and 16 core models, they're actually
[835.28 → 842.16] not having trouble keeping up with demand for their 8 core and 6 core models, which is exactly
[842.16 → 843.28] what Intel is up against.
[843.28 → 849.52] Because they have managed to top out at 8 rather than 10 cores on their 11th gen Rocket
[849.52 → 852.78] Lake processors compared to their 10th gen processors.
[853.02 → 859.02] So the 11700K has already been dropped from $420 to $405.
[859.56 → 862.56] The did I say 11700K?
[862.68 → 863.24] I hope I did.
[863.34 → 864.16] Because I think so.
[864.16 → 868.12] And the 10700K is down almost $100 to $317.
[868.44 → 874.94] You know what's interesting though, is because the 10700K and 11700K are so similar in terms
[874.94 → 882.34] of gaming performance, the 10700K with like a budget motherboard is kind of a killer value.
[883.22 → 886.20] Like Luke, hold on just a minute here.
[886.64 → 892.46] Did Intel just become the like bang for the buck budget chipmaker?
[892.46 → 895.16] That would be a really spicy video to make.
[895.30 → 895.88] Not going to lie.
[896.38 → 897.46] I know, right?
[897.58 → 898.68] We should totally, oh wow.
[898.68 → 901.04] You get some, you get some reactions from that.
[901.28 → 903.24] We should totally do it.
[904.00 → 906.38] If you want to talk about bait titles like that.
[907.28 → 909.14] Intel is the budget king.
[909.76 → 911.40] AMD overcharges.
[912.10 → 912.48] Or whatever.
[912.62 → 914.32] I'll come up with a better title than that.
[914.40 → 917.80] But like, how the, how the turns have tabled.
[917.80 → 929.56] And the thing is, unless you need PCI Express Gen 4, 11th Gen offers basically nothing over
[929.56 → 930.06] 10th Gen.
[930.12 → 932.86] With that said, I am, oh man.
[932.86 → 937.00] If you're going, if you're going for a budget processor, you probably don't need PCIe Gen 4.
[937.26 → 938.00] Well, okay.
[938.10 → 939.16] Hold on a second, Luke.
[939.20 → 944.08] Because the thing is that even a 10700K, it's a $317 processor.
[944.08 → 949.46] I mean, we're talking, you're building a computer that's like a thousand US dollars at that
[949.46 → 950.56] point at minimum.
[950.70 → 953.04] And that's even if graphics cards aren't insane.
[953.26 → 955.94] So that's not, that's not budget.
[956.10 → 957.84] To me, budget is you're looking for like.
[957.84 → 960.46] Yeah, but what card are you going to get in that range that needs PCIe 4?
[960.70 → 961.06] Okay.
[961.18 → 962.38] But that's not the question.
[962.60 → 963.82] See, this is why.
[963.82 → 964.78] No, that was a question.
[964.86 → 965.48] No, no, no, no.
[965.54 → 966.46] That's not the question.
[966.54 → 972.30] Because, because no graphics card, even an RTX, like RTX 3090.
[972.30 → 972.70] Okay.
[973.24 → 976.62] No graphics card requires PCIe Gen 4.
[977.10 → 977.42] Okay.
[977.56 → 977.86] I see.
[977.96 → 978.22] I see.
[978.30 → 978.52] I see.
[978.74 → 982.68] But, but here's where the question gets a little spicier for me.
[983.14 → 983.84] Direct storage.
[984.80 → 985.40] Okay.
[985.78 → 992.54] Because that's the one application where all of a sudden I could go, holy crap.
[993.14 → 997.84] I just went, I spent $317 on a processor.
[998.24 → 1000.12] I just got a whole rig upgrade.
[1000.12 → 1001.38] Oh no.
[1001.58 → 1003.16] There's a new game that came out.
[1003.36 → 1004.90] It supports direct storage.
[1004.90 → 1008.96] Direct storage is amazing in some way.
[1009.30 → 1014.28] Like it cuts your, it cuts your loading times down to a fraction or, or Microsoft manages
[1014.28 → 1016.78] to implement that crazy balls.
[1016.92 → 1022.44] Amazing tech that Sony was talking about where their SSD was so fast that it managed to stream
[1022.44 → 1026.40] textures off the SSD instead of using GPU memory.
[1026.40 → 1033.56] Like if that kind of technology happens, and you do not have a high performance M.2 SSD
[1033.56 → 1039.12] on a PCI Express Gen 4 slot, you will not be participating, and you will not be able to
[1039.12 → 1040.60] simply upgrade your SSD.
[1041.24 → 1041.72] Yeah.
[1042.44 → 1045.78] Unless, I mean, you do have options.
[1045.96 → 1047.24] Actually, man.
[1047.88 → 1049.84] And to be clear, I'm not saying that will happen.
[1049.84 → 1054.62] The chances that that happens, I think are actually pretty slim, especially because we've
[1054.62 → 1056.64] already seen that.
[1057.30 → 1062.62] Then again, the games haven't really been built ground up for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
[1062.62 → 1062.86] X.
[1062.94 → 1063.74] So we don't actually know.
[1064.08 → 1070.06] But so far it looks like loading times in particular are not affected that much compared
[1070.06 → 1072.38] to PC, even if you're running on a SATA SSD.
[1073.04 → 1073.74] So we don't know.
[1074.14 → 1074.40] Sorry.
[1074.40 → 1080.96] I know you did caveat this, but it usually takes like a couple of years for console improvements
[1080.96 → 1081.62] to actually hit.
[1081.76 → 1082.24] It does.
[1082.66 → 1085.68] But remember too, I hate to use the F word, right?
[1086.28 → 1087.72] I hate to use the F word.
[1088.12 → 1095.56] But when we're talking about future proofing your rig, okay, I don't like buying stuff that
[1095.56 → 1098.34] I know has a solid chance of being obsolete.
[1098.44 → 1099.48] Now you can hedge your bets.
[1099.94 → 1100.98] It won't be obsolete though.
[1101.48 → 1102.40] You can hedge your bets.
[1102.40 → 1107.28] You could buy a motherboard that you know has PCI Express Gen 4 support, and you could
[1107.28 → 1108.86] go, okay, well, screw it.
[1109.08 → 1113.76] I'll pick up a secondhand Rocket Lake in a few years down the road, and I'll swap out my
[1113.76 → 1115.50] CPU if I really need Gen 4.
[1115.90 → 1122.22] And I think there's an opportunity if this takes off for an SSD manufacturer that's really
[1122.22 → 1129.20] savvy to kind of run out and build a PCI Express Gen 3 8X card, which would have exactly
[1129.20 → 1133.94] the same bandwidth as an M.2 running Gen 4 at 4X, right?
[1134.02 → 1136.68] Because it's double going from PCI Gen 3 to Gen 4.
[1137.02 → 1140.76] And then if you have double the number of lanes on Gen 3, that's the same bandwidth as
[1140.76 → 1142.16] half the number of lanes on Gen 4.
[1142.30 → 1148.90] So if someone went and built like an 8X interface Gen 3 card that matched that kind of performance
[1148.90 → 1153.40] and you could just plug that into your second 16X slot, which would then be running at 8X
[1153.40 → 1156.52] slot directly off the CPU, that would solve the problem.
[1157.52 → 1161.70] So clearly we have a workaround and if this actually ends up being a problem, someone will
[1161.70 → 1162.08] solve it.
[1162.14 → 1162.72] So you know what?
[1163.12 → 1165.96] I can say confidently, go ahead.
[1166.78 → 1167.78] Go 10th Gen.
[1167.78 → 1174.76] I talked myself out of the one reason to go Rocket Lake is that it has PCI Express Gen 4
[1174.76 → 1180.74] and it has four more lanes that go straight to the primary M.2 slot instead of running
[1180.74 → 1185.38] all the lanes either to the 16X graphics card slot or through the chipset.
[1187.46 → 1188.14] Okay.
[1188.70 → 1195.52] In other related news, third gen Leon Ice Lake on 10 nanometers is much better than second
[1195.52 → 1198.94] gen, but not enough to catch AMD.
[1199.32 → 1205.34] So they've got a 40 core 8380 platinum processor that manages all cores running at 3 gigahertz.
[1206.02 → 1209.50] Dang, that would be really impressive if AMD hadn't already crapped all over it.
[1210.16 → 1215.54] That's a 270 watt TDP, which is not especially impressive.
[1216.10 → 1224.52] Eight, eight channel DDR4 3200 DRAM support and an watch ring $8,099 price.
[1224.52 → 1231.18] Now, hold on just a gosh darn moment here because in a vacuum, that's impressive.
[1231.32 → 1237.88] But Luke, run us through the specs of what AMD's competing Epic 7763 hat.
[1238.22 → 1239.50] Come on, run us through them.
[1239.86 → 1250.94] 64 cores, 128 threads, 2.4 gigahertz base, 3.5 gigahertz turbo, all core, 3.2 gigahertz.
[1250.94 → 1253.18] That's probably the one that matters more than the front of the animals.
[1254.06 → 1256.14] 256 megabytes L3 cap.
[1256.14 → 1256.50] Ouch.
[1257.30 → 1261.54] That's got a little bit higher, but doesn't really matter, I don't think, too much in this
[1261.54 → 1261.80] scenario.
[1261.90 → 1262.86] 280 watt TDP.
[1263.14 → 1263.44] Okay.
[1263.88 → 1264.22] All right.
[1264.70 → 1265.36] And it's cheaper.
[1266.04 → 1268.30] Oh, oh, that's the final nail, Luke.
[1268.30 → 1269.36] That's the last one.
[1269.36 → 1272.64] That's the final nail, Luke.
[1273.36 → 1273.48] Now.
[1273.48 → 1277.56] It's kind of rough because they got to know, like, if they're releasing this now, like,
[1277.62 → 1279.44] they must see that spec sheet, right?
[1279.78 → 1281.54] How do you release that more expensive?
[1281.70 → 1282.50] I guess availability.
[1282.86 → 1284.22] You got to remember, right?
[1284.22 → 1286.08] Like, even Rocket Lake.
[1286.30 → 1289.00] This showed up in, I think it was in AMA.
[1289.76 → 1291.38] Rocket Lake, greenlet.
[1291.94 → 1293.52] When did this bloody thing?
[1293.60 → 1293.80] Yes.
[1294.02 → 1294.28] Okay.
[1294.72 → 1296.02] So, Rocket Lake.
[1296.06 → 1301.70] And this is desktop, which tends to have a bit of a faster product cycle than enterprise.
[1302.32 → 1311.12] It was greenlet back when, months prior to rival AMD starting to move to its 7 nanometre
[1311.12 → 1313.90] manufacturing process with the Ry zen 3000 chips.
[1314.22 → 1314.98] Okay.
[1315.08 → 1320.48] So, that's the kind of timescale that CPU manufacturers are working on, guys.
[1321.22 → 1322.36] Right, but not price tag.
[1322.70 → 1329.60] Intel basically greenlet these projects when they didn't know that they were going to be
[1329.60 → 1332.96] going up against a truly resurgent AMD.
[1333.32 → 1336.36] Like, if I was Intel and I didn't know any better, right?
[1336.56 → 1340.90] I would look at AMD's first generation Ry zen and go, okay.
[1341.66 → 1344.16] Yeah, we're going to have to, like, maybe make some...
[1344.16 → 1345.22] It's a little rough for now, but we just don't win.
[1345.22 → 1345.26] Yeah.
[1345.38 → 1348.36] We're going to have to make some processors with more cores or whatever.
[1348.36 → 1356.82] But they are so, so far off the kinds of clock speeds we can hit and so far off the IPC that
[1356.82 → 1364.18] even if they get the same kind of generational improvements that we get, they are many years
[1364.18 → 1368.96] away from competing with even what we have today legitimately, like, beating it.
[1368.96 → 1375.68] The problem is that Intel was coming at this from the attitude of that, you know, four to
[1375.68 → 1382.06] nine percent performance improvements every couple of years were normal.
[1383.10 → 1384.44] AMD made a new normal.
[1384.76 → 1391.16] AMD made a normal where each generation of new processor makes you feel like a crappy, you
[1391.16 → 1393.18] know, pleb for having the old one.
[1393.18 → 1394.72] And I love it that way.
[1394.80 → 1395.64] It's fantastic.
[1395.90 → 1396.14] Getting...
[1396.14 → 1396.56] It's more fun.
[1396.86 → 1398.78] Getting actual upgrades.
[1399.12 → 1399.90] It's amazing.
[1400.40 → 1403.66] And then they went and made it so you could just plonk them onto your old motherboard and
[1403.66 → 1404.80] flip your old one on eBay.
[1405.00 → 1405.90] It's good stuff.
[1405.98 → 1407.06] It's great for consumers.
[1407.60 → 1409.20] It feels a little bit more like the old days.
[1409.32 → 1411.10] Yeah, it does feel more like the old days.
[1411.16 → 1414.88] It's not great for Intel because they're running around green lighting processors thinking they
[1414.88 → 1415.92] don't have any competition.
[1416.06 → 1417.94] And by the time they come to market, it's like...
[1417.94 → 1422.22] Now, to be clear, it's not like Intel is in some kind of dire straits here.
[1422.22 → 1425.48] They have so much cash in the bank, so much R&D muscle.
[1425.68 → 1430.40] I absolutely love the new hiring decisions that they are making lately, or rather old
[1430.40 → 1431.18] hiring decisions.
[1431.58 → 1434.00] Going back to the basics.
[1434.44 → 1435.96] Put the engineers in charge.
[1436.24 → 1438.50] I freaking love the new direction over there.
[1438.84 → 1445.54] Just guys, you have to think, okay, if Rocket Lake is coming out now, okay, and was greenlet
[1445.54 → 1451.54] then, if they just put a new team in place now, we're not going to see the fruits of this
[1451.54 → 1455.12] labour for another two to three years if we are lucky.
[1457.00 → 1461.48] And I don't think that's going to be a huge problem for them because at the end of the
[1461.48 → 1464.42] day, what Intel has is fab capacity.
[1464.76 → 1471.68] So even though AMD Epic has been absolutely stomping all over Intel in terms of performance
[1471.68 → 1476.72] for the last at least year, and they've been very competitive for a couple of years, and it's
[1476.72 → 1482.18] only going to get worse from here on out, they just do not have the production capacity
[1482.18 → 1483.68] to serve that market.
[1483.82 → 1484.74] It's not even close.
[1484.84 → 1489.48] Like, I think Intel's market share is still over 80% in the server and enterprise space.
[1489.48 → 1493.24] Like, it's just, it's not even, it's not even close.
[1494.74 → 1502.70] So Intel has time, but good on AMD for putting the gears to them and just coming out with such
[1502.70 → 1505.08] a one-sided...
[1505.08 → 1508.48] Do you think they might still be able to move these a bit because of availability?
[1508.98 → 1514.46] And like, a lot of, yeah, a lot of enterprise places, they're going to have to buy huge amounts
[1514.46 → 1514.96] of these things.
[1514.96 → 1515.14] Absolutely.
[1515.14 → 1517.18] Yeah, they're not going to have a choice.
[1517.74 → 1522.18] So for Intel's customers, who are Intel's customers, whether they like it or not, because
[1522.18 → 1527.26] Intel has stock and AMD doesn't, for Intel's customers, there is a huge benefit to releasing
[1527.26 → 1527.86] these products.
[1527.86 → 1535.38] Now, all of a sudden, they can get closer to what they could have gotten with AMD, and that's
[1535.38 → 1536.82] better than not being closer.
[1537.22 → 1539.44] So it's not like they shouldn't release these products.
[1539.50 → 1541.00] I'm not saying they shouldn't have greenlet them.
[1541.00 → 1545.56] I'm just saying that it's not that they release a non-competitive product because they're
[1545.56 → 1546.92] stupid dummies.
[1547.12 → 1551.60] They just do it because they greenlet the product without the knowledge that we have
[1551.60 → 1552.50] today.
[1552.78 → 1554.04] What are they going to do with it now?
[1554.20 → 1555.16] Not try to sell it?
[1555.30 → 1556.14] Like, they might as well.
[1556.56 → 1558.80] They know there are some availability issues on the other side.
[1558.90 → 1563.90] They know they might get some big contracts just because those people need processors.
[1564.50 → 1567.52] It doesn't necessarily matter that it's like more expensive and worse.
[1567.52 → 1570.66] They need the stuff, man.
[1571.00 → 1571.36] Exactly.
[1571.98 → 1572.64] Build some servers.
[1573.12 → 1576.44] I mean, the thing is, here's actually, this is great.
[1576.76 → 1580.68] This is an example of something similar, but this time in the YouTube space.
[1580.68 → 1583.08] I'm going to go ahead and pop on my display capture over here.
[1583.46 → 1587.72] So I did a quick YouTube search for Walmart gaming PC.
[1588.10 → 1588.36] Okay.
[1588.44 → 1590.32] So the top hit is us.
[1590.40 → 1591.76] We got 12 million views on that video.
[1591.84 → 1592.76] That's absolutely incredible.
[1592.84 → 1595.74] It was a lot of fun because the thing was so bad.
[1595.74 → 1601.40] Um, but we wanted to do a follow-up building a DIY gaming PC at Walmart.
[1601.68 → 1606.12] So I greenlet this project, building a gaming PC at Walmart.
[1606.74 → 1607.18] What?
[1607.92 → 1612.96] Uh, knowing that we were going to be at a bit of a disadvantage making this video because
[1612.96 → 1617.80] we can't physically go to a U S Walmart where they actually do stock some computer hardware.
[1617.80 → 1624.30] And, um, you know, because of COVID, it was going to take a long time to get everything,
[1624.30 → 1626.44] you know, through customs and shipped.
[1626.44 → 1632.14] But I didn't think that I was under any kind of pressure to make the video in a timely manner.
[1632.14 → 1632.88] So we greenlet it.
[1632.92 → 1633.72] We got all the parts.
[1633.90 → 1634.88] They arrived.
[1634.88 → 1641.08] And I went and looked at Austin's channel and realized, Oh no, not only did Austin just
[1641.08 → 1642.34] do this concept.
[1642.74 → 1645.68] Uh, so this is before we filmed it, we realized.
[1645.68 → 1647.68] So it's about two to three weeks before this.
[1647.72 → 1649.64] So it had just come out a few weeks ago.
[1649.84 → 1656.64] So we look, and we go, not only has Austin done this concept, but he just did it weeks
[1656.64 → 1656.98] ago.
[1656.98 → 1660.38] And frankly did a way better job than us.
[1660.66 → 1661.70] Now what do we do?
[1661.70 → 1665.28] My favourite thing about this, which I realized right before you said it, because I was trying
[1665.28 → 1666.34] to find what you're talking about.
[1666.38 → 1670.90] Cause again, we talked, was it before the stream about how I can't see what you're talking about
[1670.90 → 1671.26] live.
[1671.76 → 1676.22] So I'm trying to search it and I find Austin's video, but I hear you say the title.
[1676.32 → 1677.36] I was like, this is the same thing.
[1677.42 → 1682.02] And then I found yours, and I was like, uh, the ellipses are just moved.
[1682.36 → 1683.82] Everything else is the same.
[1683.82 → 1693.62] So by the time we knew at, but at the time we were filming, we knew that we were going
[1693.62 → 1699.58] to be effectively copying his video, but we didn't copy it.
[1699.86 → 1705.38] We had the idea to do a follow-up on Walmart gaming PCs where you build it yourself independently.
[1705.68 → 1712.24] We just happened to execute on it slower than him and worse due to circumstances beyond our
[1712.24 → 1715.78] control, like that we are not American and cannot go to a U S Walmart.
[1716.20 → 1722.38] And so we made the decision that rather than launching nothing and getting, you know, zero
[1722.38 → 1726.40] engagement with our audience, we are going to launch something.
[1726.66 → 1735.88] And yeah, we're not going to get as many views as our bitter rival, Austin Evans, but we're going to get
[1735.88 → 1741.94] Austin, the Boston Evans, some, we're going to try and find some ways that we can, you know, add our
[1741.94 → 1747.58] voice to this conversation and put our own unique spin on it and, uh, move on to move on to the next
[1747.58 → 1748.00] project.
[1748.00 → 1750.38] And so that's pretty much what Intel is doing here.
[1750.48 → 1755.66] They are realizing in the lead up to launching this product that they are not even close to
[1755.66 → 1760.46] competitive, but making the decision to go ahead, knowing that they're better off launching
[1760.46 → 1763.08] something than launching nothing.
[1763.70 → 1764.80] That's the bottom line.
[1765.30 → 1769.36] That happened to me, uh, sort of almost similar.
[1769.60 → 1774.56] I didn't know it was, uh, I didn't know his video was his video dropped after we had already
[1774.56 → 1777.62] filmed it, but the networking vault wall video with Jay's two cents back in the day.
[1777.66 → 1778.16] Do you remember that?
[1778.54 → 1779.44] I do remember that.
[1779.46 → 1780.12] Jay was super cool about it.
[1780.28 → 1785.22] I remember Jay's audience was like ripping us apart and Jay was like, Whoa, guys, relax.
[1785.22 → 1791.54] For the history, uh, Luke did a video on making your own like network gear wall.
[1792.20 → 1794.62] Uh, I'll see if I can find it here real quick.
[1794.70 → 1794.80] Yeah.
[1794.90 → 1797.34] This is that were easy to find.
[1798.46 → 1803.82] Oh, and that's back when you could put the word ghetto in a YouTube video title and, um,
[1803.98 → 1805.78] I should probably just change that title.
[1805.92 → 1809.58] So anyway, uh, DIY networking wall, a renter solution.
[1809.58 → 1815.24] Luke basically mounts all the network gear to the wall and kind of cable manages it in
[1815.24 → 1816.06] like six minutes.
[1816.06 → 1817.46] Cause that's all the time we had left.
[1818.14 → 1826.48] And the comment section of this video, like Luke got absolutely torn apart for ripping off
[1826.48 → 1828.06] Jay's idea.
[1828.46 → 1828.84] Okay.
[1828.98 → 1830.20] He ripped it off.
[1830.96 → 1837.24] And meanwhile, Jay's like, guys, people come up with the same idea all the time.
[1837.24 → 1845.32] And so a and B, it's not like I invented this idea, and we've seen the same stupid stuff
[1845.32 → 1850.10] on just, I mean, just about any video that multiple YouTubers make in the tech space.
[1850.10 → 1855.38] Like no one seems to care that everyone and their dog does a video, you know, uh, hydro
[1855.38 → 1860.66] dipping something within the same week, like in the, um, you know, in the, you know, comedy
[1860.66 → 1862.82] or like vlogger type of space.
[1862.82 → 1866.66] But for whatever reason in the tech space, if two people do a video about the same topic,
[1866.72 → 1868.54] it's like, Oh, copied, copied.
[1869.26 → 1873.58] Um, I mean, another perfect example is like building a PC with your kid.
[1873.70 → 1877.10] I got so many comments that I was like ripping off Jay's two cents idea.
[1877.20 → 1880.60] I'm not, I'm going to give you guys a newsflash back then five years ago.
[1881.04 → 1883.48] And today I don't watch Jay's videos.
[1883.48 → 1888.18] I, I like, I don't need Jay to keep me up to speed on tech.
[1888.42 → 1892.94] Like I'm on the same briefings as him most of the time, right?
[1893.00 → 1895.08] Like I, it's just not necessary for me.
[1895.14 → 1897.36] I didn't know he had made a network wall video.
[1897.60 → 1899.64] I didn't know he had done a build with his daughter.
[1900.04 → 1907.06] And especially the like Dying something with your kid and uploading it to YouTube genre.
[1907.06 → 1914.30] Um, newsflash, not invented by me, not invented by him at all.
[1914.38 → 1917.10] Like that's not, that ain't a new thing.
[1917.66 → 1923.20] So I, uh, some, some additional weird, uh, behind the scenes for that video.
[1923.42 → 1923.66] Yeah.
[1923.70 → 1926.08] Do you remember the conditions that that video was filmed under?
[1926.50 → 1931.30] I think it was extremely time-limited, but I don't remember anything other than that.
[1931.30 → 1936.38] I know that, that I know that the reason you needed a renter's solution to mount your networking
[1936.38 → 1940.52] crap to the wall is because you were renting from me and I wouldn't let you mount anything
[1940.52 → 1941.12] to the wall.
[1941.22 → 1942.50] Is that what you're asking me?
[1942.88 → 1946.44] No, no, it wasn't actually, but that's a fun little anecdote as well is yeah.
[1946.44 → 1950.20] The whole renter's solution idea, just in case you don't watch the video, uh, is that
[1950.20 → 1954.64] I mount, I mounted all to like a wooden board that I could put against the wall without scrolling
[1954.64 → 1958.94] the board into the wall, scrolling, uh, screwing the board into the wall because Linus wouldn't
[1958.94 → 1961.20] wouldn't let me, but I still wanted to wall mount everything.
[1961.30 → 1967.52] Uh, but that was after we did the, uh, what was it even called?
[1967.56 → 1974.04] It was like the gamers versus pros vessel thing, the hockey video.
[1974.90 → 1977.96] Oh, like nerd sports, nerd sports.
[1978.10 → 1981.92] That, that was the night of the nerd sports hockey video.
[1982.12 → 1984.68] I don't know if you remember, but that got super delayed.
[1984.90 → 1987.04] We were there like way too late.
[1987.40 → 1987.88] Yes.
[1988.24 → 1991.16] Um, and I was supposed to film this before I flew to Switzerland.
[1991.30 → 1992.84] Right.
[1993.22 → 1994.62] So I had to get it done.
[1994.62 → 1996.12] Like there was no question.
[1996.12 → 1997.56] So Brandon and I are filming this.
[1997.94 → 2004.38] Another weird little tidbit about that video is that my, my like socks didn't fit or something.
[2004.38 → 2007.48] So the laces on my, do you remember this part?
[2008.40 → 2013.42] The laces on my ice skates had like, Oh my goodness, you found it.
[2013.42 → 2015.68] Oh, I guess it's on channel super fun now.
[2015.68 → 2015.82] Right?
[2015.90 → 2016.16] Yeah.
[2017.56 → 2018.00] Yeah.
[2018.00 → 2023.72] I don't know if this gets detailed in the video, but the laces on my ice skates were like carving my skin out.
[2023.82 → 2024.88] And I had these divots.
[2024.98 → 2027.96] I still have scars from it even on my ankles.
[2027.96 → 2028.96] Oh man.
[2028.96 → 2029.06] Oh man.
[2030.78 → 2032.16] These videos were amazing.
[2032.32 → 2033.86] These videos were actually incredible.
[2034.56 → 2036.48] They could have been so much better.
[2037.02 → 2040.72] Like it's, it's, it's an amazing and be tragic.
[2041.08 → 2044.30] How good they are and how much better they should have been.
[2044.78 → 2045.10] Yeah.
[2045.10 → 2047.10] Oh man.
[2048.96 → 2051.02] We actually look not that bad here.
[2051.08 → 2051.74] You and me though.
[2051.86 → 2052.12] Hold on.
[2052.18 → 2052.96] Where, where is this?
[2053.60 → 2054.92] We had a, I should have scored.
[2055.28 → 2055.86] I know.
[2056.22 → 2056.52] I know.
[2057.16 → 2058.50] That was a perfect pass.
[2058.64 → 2060.60] I think I didn't see it coming, but I should have.
[2060.68 → 2061.30] Well, rebound.
[2061.40 → 2062.16] I didn't pass.
[2062.18 → 2064.22] I just, I managed to not stuff it.
[2064.22 → 2064.54] Oh.
[2067.34 → 2067.78] Anyway.
[2067.94 → 2074.48] I, so my, this whole video was filmed at I think like 11 PM to midnight when Brandon
[2074.48 → 2078.66] and I know that we can't do like retakes of anything because we, we both have to go catch
[2078.66 → 2079.08] a plane.
[2079.72 → 2083.60] And both of my ankles are like actively bleeding the whole time I'm trying to shoot.
[2087.68 → 2090.00] Old LTT was so psycho.
[2090.54 → 2091.32] Oh man.
[2091.96 → 2092.52] Yeah.
[2092.84 → 2099.98] You know, it's funny because I often ask myself, I'm like, how is it that we have like 50 people
[2099.98 → 2103.66] working here now, and we still make the same number of videos we always did.
[2104.56 → 2108.48] It's because we pushed it way too hard back then.
[2109.12 → 2110.20] It was kind of nuts.
[2110.32 → 2112.20] I am not a 20 something anymore.
[2112.44 → 2116.76] Like I cannot push the way I used to.
[2116.98 → 2119.98] And are you even a 20 something anymore?
[2120.48 → 2120.74] Nope.
[2121.96 → 2124.84] And Luke is not a 20 something anymore.
[2124.96 → 2128.22] Like we can't, we can't do it like we used to.
[2128.22 → 2131.50] Uh, player 69 was me, BT Ñuñoa.
[2131.64 → 2134.96] And then I think Luke, you were 59, 57, probably.
[2135.18 → 2135.36] Yeah.
[2135.52 → 2136.38] That makes more sense.
[2136.88 → 2138.74] Um, yeah.
[2139.04 → 2140.80] Oh, YouTube.
[2142.80 → 2147.08] Jed calm over on Twitch is like YouTube sweatshop back in the day.
[2147.08 → 2153.86] No, but really, I think the statute of limitations has probably expired on most of the illegal
[2153.86 → 2156.34] stuff that we did in the early days of the media group.
[2156.60 → 2160.30] So I can start to admit it now, but like, okay.
[2160.30 → 2168.32] We have come a long way, and we've worked really hard to adhere to all labour code and employment
[2168.32 → 2168.96] standards.
[2170.20 → 2170.82] I will.
[2171.16 → 2176.90] I mean, there was a lot of stuff that you, you told me and you, you, I'm sure you told
[2176.90 → 2179.18] Ed, and I'm sure you told Brandon the same kind of stuff.
[2179.18 → 2184.04] And a lot of the other early employees, you told us not to do it, but we just kind of wanted
[2184.04 → 2184.34] to do it.
[2184.34 → 2188.64] Anyway, I can, I can think of quite a number of like the, the original Titan launch.
[2188.68 → 2190.72] You told me to stop many times.
[2190.82 → 2191.72] Stop benchmarking.
[2192.24 → 2196.68] Lots of times, but at the same time I was like, no, I want to, I want to get this done.
[2196.80 → 2199.38] And I also had the ability to, because I was younger.
[2199.58 → 2200.42] You just didn't sleep.
[2201.70 → 2202.98] I can't do that stuff anymore.
[2202.98 → 2204.92] I can barely go 24 hours now.
[2205.06 → 2207.02] And that was, that was like three days or something.
[2207.18 → 2207.80] But anyway.
[2208.14 → 2208.54] Yeah, I know.
[2208.60 → 2208.82] Right.
[2209.18 → 2211.32] Uh, we should probably get through the sponsors for this.
[2211.32 → 2216.40] Speaking of how we managed to have the income that we need to do everything properly.
[2216.58 → 2217.68] Hey, it's all guys.
[2217.92 → 2219.12] Check out our sponsors.
[2219.24 → 2219.60] All right.
[2220.10 → 2223.48] Because it is all thanks to sponsors like these.
[2223.48 → 2229.52] And also all thanks to the hard work of the people who tried so hard in the early days.
[2229.66 → 2234.18] So our first sponsor today is, uh, hold on a second.
[2234.26 → 2235.28] Does this video thing?
[2235.34 → 2235.58] Okay.
[2235.64 → 2236.04] It doesn't.
[2236.44 → 2237.64] His cloud Linux.
[2237.76 → 2237.94] Okay.
[2237.94 → 2241.06] If your Linux distribution is about to reach end of life, or it already has.
[2241.06 → 2242.32] You got some work to do.
[2242.74 → 2244.94] Take control of your, oh, dang it.
[2245.00 → 2246.08] Take control of your video.
[2246.20 → 2250.74] That's 4k for whatever reason, even though I'm going to play it back on WAN show, whatever.
[2250.90 → 2251.38] There it is.
[2251.74 → 2255.80] Take control of your end of life upgrade strategy with extended lifestyle life.
[2256.98 → 2258.80] I swear I can do this.
[2259.10 → 2259.46] All right.
[2259.50 → 2260.16] We're going back.
[2260.64 → 2264.68] Extended life cycle support services from cloud Linux.
[2264.98 → 2265.82] The services.
[2266.24 → 2267.34] Give it a rest, Luke.
[2267.34 → 2277.30] The service is now available for CentOS 6, Oracle Linux 6, and Ubuntu 16.04, extending the life of those versions four years after the EOL date.
[2277.84 → 2282.22] Extended life cycle support includes updates and security patches for all packages of the OS.
[2282.90 → 2285.20] Doesn't affect any of your currently running infrastructures.
[2285.56 → 2286.48] Is affordably priced.
[2286.74 → 2288.94] And doesn't require a minimum subscription period.
[2289.28 → 2291.44] So keep your EOL distributions going.
[2291.44 → 2295.84] Visit ELSPortal.com or click the link in the video description.
[2296.34 → 2301.26] The show is also brought to you today by, oh, I'm going to remove that thing.
[2301.78 → 2303.16] See Sonic.
[2304.10 → 2305.20] I'm just going to go ahead.
[2305.26 → 2305.52] You know what?
[2305.52 → 2307.54] I'm just going to copy the thing over top there.
[2307.70 → 2307.96] Boom.
[2308.58 → 2309.28] See Sonic.
[2309.64 → 2316.20] They've got power supplies with up to 80 plus titanium efficiency, which is the highest level of 80 plus certification.
[2316.20 → 2322.18] Like we're talking between 91 and 94 percent efficiency at all times under any load.
[2322.32 → 2326.26] They've got their like super quiet fluid dynamic fan.
[2326.46 → 2334.18] They've got their premium hybrid fan control, which actually turns that super quiet fan off when you're not under heavy load to keep fan noise minimal.
[2334.56 → 2336.20] And extend the lifetime of your fan.
[2336.32 → 2338.52] Hey, there's a benefit they actually don't even talk about.
[2338.84 → 2340.94] They've got their micro tolerance load regulation.
[2341.48 → 2343.30] Their 12-year warranty.
[2343.30 → 2343.82] See, that's right.
[2343.90 → 2352.04] See Sonic has up to 12 year warranties, and you can learn more on See Sonic's website or on Amazon at the link in the video description.
[2353.46 → 2360.16] Finally, the show is brought to you by one of our longest running sponsors, Private Internet Access.
[2360.74 → 2363.24] Yes, my friends, do not be confused.
[2363.60 → 2369.40] The rumours of us working with other VPNs have been grossly exaggerated.
[2369.94 → 2371.34] We work with PIA.
[2371.60 → 2371.84] Why?
[2371.84 → 2375.38] Because they have reliable service and no bandwidth caps.
[2375.52 → 2380.72] PIA offers configurable encryption and an internet kill switch to keep you in control of your connection.
[2381.28 → 2388.38] And when it's combined with private browsing best practices, PIA can even make websites think that you are in a different country.
[2388.78 → 2395.58] With PIA, you can connect up to 10 devices at once with a single account with clients for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and Linux.
[2395.58 → 2404.38] And they also recently launched, this is super cool, a dedicated IP option that has absolutely zero connection to your account or who you are.
[2404.38 → 2411.96] All it does is make it so you don't get so many annoying pop-ups that are verifying that you're an actual human, which you sometimes get when you're on a VPN.
[2411.96 → 2418.00] They've already got over 24,000 servers in 77 countries.
[2418.00 → 2419.94] And you don't have to take my word for it.
[2419.94 → 2427.26] Try PIA risk-free with their 30-day money-back guarantee at leg.GG slash PIA WAN.
[2427.26 → 2431.12] We have some more great topics for you guys today, so don't go away.
[2431.66 → 2433.26] Why don't we chat about...
[2434.24 → 2435.50] What about the thing?
[2436.30 → 2437.56] The thing? What thing?
[2437.68 → 2439.16] The thing. This thing.
[2439.28 → 2439.64] What thing?
[2439.86 → 2442.14] I don't... I'm not like a thousand percent sure.
[2442.84 → 2444.72] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[2444.94 → 2447.24] It's the first thing above the sponsors.
[2447.68 → 2450.04] The first thing above the sponsors. Oh, yeah, this is going to be fun.
[2450.52 → 2454.78] So the verified actual gamer program is going real life.
[2454.78 → 2456.52] We have the details, guys.
[2456.52 → 2458.84] We've got the meets.
[2459.00 → 2460.64] So I talked about this last week.
[2460.72 → 2463.38] People are going to game against me.
[2463.50 → 2464.98] They're going to try and beat me.
[2465.46 → 2471.62] And if they win, they will not only be able to buy a GPU at MSRP,
[2471.62 → 2479.56] they will be able to buy a brand new GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU at a discount.
[2479.94 → 2480.58] That's right.
[2480.58 → 2485.58] I am offering up discounts on RTX GPUs.
[2485.58 → 2490.50] All you have to do is go to the link in the video in the chat.
[2490.78 → 2492.28] I'm throwing it on float plane first.
[2492.44 → 2493.90] Guys, you do have to be local.
[2494.32 → 2495.48] Do not cross a border.
[2495.86 → 2499.74] Do not violate any kind of travel restrictions in order to participate.
[2499.74 → 2502.90] We will be keeping the live event COVID safe.
[2503.06 → 2506.88] So it will actually be taking place at an undisclosed location.
[2506.88 → 2509.30] Of course, we will disclose it to the people who are participating.
[2509.52 → 2516.08] But at an undisclosed location outdoors in order to make sure that people are not breathing the same air.
[2516.08 → 2520.20] We will be sanitizing all the controllers and peripherals in between contestants.
[2520.50 → 2524.80] We will be keeping our physical distancing and all of that good stuff.
[2524.90 → 2527.68] We are going to be running this in the safest possible manner.
[2527.88 → 2531.46] But you do have to be local, unfortunately.
[2531.82 → 2532.92] So sorry to everyone else.
[2533.20 → 2534.56] But I do have good news.
[2534.72 → 2539.64] And that is that VGA has provided a ton of support for this event.
[2539.64 → 2542.78] So we will not only have GPUs available in person.
[2542.78 → 2548.98] We will have GPUs available online through the Gamer Gauntlet as part of the verified actual gamer program.
[2549.24 → 2553.66] So I am super excited to bring you guys even more details.
[2553.82 → 2555.74] I've copied those links into the chats.
[2556.14 → 2557.66] You will have to beat me.
[2558.00 → 2558.86] Actually, you know what?
[2558.94 → 2561.94] I'm not going to reveal the exact games and exact challenges.
[2562.44 → 2567.36] But there is a platformer sort of versus challenge.
[2567.36 → 2569.86] There is an FPS gaming challenge.
[2570.00 → 2572.26] Or there is a fighting game challenge.
[2572.64 → 2576.86] And you get to choose what battle arena you take me on in.
[2577.96 → 2580.00] Oh, apparently we've got the full rules.
[2580.20 → 2582.36] You'll need to come prepared to buy a graphics card.
[2582.88 → 2587.62] And if you win the match, you will get 10% off MSRP.
[2588.42 → 2591.72] And then you will get a chance to double down.
[2592.06 → 2592.34] Okay?
[2592.52 → 2596.92] If you win the rematch, you will get 25% off MSRP.
[2596.92 → 2600.72] And if you lose the rematch, you still get a chance to buy.
[2601.02 → 2602.70] But it will be at MSRP.
[2603.20 → 2603.56] Oh.
[2603.84 → 2604.16] Yeah.
[2604.40 → 2605.14] Spicy, hey?
[2605.42 → 2605.66] Oh.
[2606.26 → 2608.60] That's more than a double down, too.
[2608.78 → 2609.04] Yeah.
[2609.10 → 2609.46] Oh, yeah.
[2609.48 → 2610.56] I want to give people a chance.
[2610.82 → 2612.08] But no, guys.
[2612.16 → 2612.72] No, I'm just saying.
[2612.78 → 2614.84] Because usually, like, you would go from 10 to 20.
[2614.98 → 2616.34] But you're going from 10 to 25.
[2616.52 → 2617.12] I want to incentivize them.
[2617.12 → 2620.06] So that's quite the juicy thing to Daniela.
[2620.06 → 2622.30] Because remember, I'm a devious mother****.
[2622.42 → 2627.74] So there is no guarantee that I won't throw the first game and then try and talk you in a second.
[2627.74 → 2628.32] Thank you.
[2630.52 → 2631.50] Oh, my goodness.
[2631.76 → 2632.84] You better watch out.
[2633.84 → 2635.36] So that's going to be a lot of fun.
[2635.46 → 2638.16] Oh, we actually also have an LTT store update, guys.
[2638.20 → 2639.36] I'll give that to you real quick.
[2639.62 → 2642.16] Our keyboard shirts are two for $30.
[2642.16 → 2645.10] The promo ends Sunday at $11.59.
[2645.50 → 2647.14] They're super high quality shirts.
[2647.28 → 2649.56] They've got keyboards printed on the front of them.
[2649.62 → 2650.30] They look great.
[2650.68 → 2655.36] I'm just going to go ahead and show you guys, if you're not already familiar with this particular design.
[2656.04 → 2656.94] Keyboard shirts.
[2657.06 → 2657.94] Where are they?
[2658.58 → 2659.14] There they are.
[2659.22 → 2659.72] Keyboard shirts.
[2659.82 → 2662.18] They are available in all the usual colours.
[2662.30 → 2663.08] You got your black.
[2663.42 → 2664.54] You got your red.
[2664.80 → 2665.90] You got your blue.
[2666.16 → 2669.36] And, of course, you got your brown keyboards.
[2669.36 → 2674.42] They are two for $30 until the end of day Pacific time Sunday.
[2675.46 → 2678.94] In other big news, the Pixel Watch has leaked.
[2679.34 → 2684.52] So John Prosser, the sometimes accurate leaker and creator of FrontPageTech,
[2684.60 → 2691.82] has worked with Ian Balbo to create renders of the Google Pixel Watch based on Prosser's sources.
[2692.60 → 2694.96] Now, just one quick second before you go into the next topic.
[2695.08 → 2698.46] Did you say we have brown key switch keyboards?
[2698.46 → 2700.06] Picks shirts?
[2700.36 → 2700.46] Yeah.
[2701.24 → 2707.64] I need everyone who knows him to let Glass know that we have some stock of the brown ones.
[2707.96 → 2709.20] Oh, Glass?
[2709.86 → 2710.34] Glass.
[2710.38 → 2714.02] Glass is definitely, he's a big fan of Cherry MX brown keyboards specifically.
[2714.44 → 2717.84] So he's going to want to buy maybe a large stock of those.
[2718.08 → 2718.44] All right.
[2718.66 → 2721.56] So here's John's renders.
[2721.56 → 2725.54] Now, apparently, John actually saw images.
[2725.96 → 2731.74] But in order to protect the source of the leak, he was not able to show the pictures.
[2732.44 → 2735.20] So instead, he actually went to the work.
[2735.26 → 2736.44] This is absolutely incredible.
[2736.58 → 2739.34] You guys are going to want to go watch his video over on FrontPageTech.
[2739.34 → 2749.68] Actually went to the work of creating renders based on the images he saw to show people what the Pixel Watch is going to look like.
[2749.68 → 2757.00] The one thing that John can't show us is if anyone is actually going to care, including Google.
[2758.62 → 2759.30] Ooh, yeah.
[2759.54 → 2770.46] The project is internally codename Rohan because maybe the idea is that the entire rest of the Android Wear ecosystem, excuse me, Wear OS ecosystem is failing.
[2770.82 → 2773.44] And only Rohan can come to the rescue.
[2773.44 → 2777.74] No one else will come to their aid.
[2777.88 → 2778.48] No one else will.
[2778.56 → 2778.72] Yeah.
[2780.24 → 2781.76] And Rohan will answer.
[2782.22 → 2788.20] So Prosser speculates that it may be powered by Google's in-house chips that the company has reportedly been developing.
[2788.56 → 2790.00] That kind of makes sense.
[2790.08 → 2797.60] At least I would hope so if they're going to be branding it Pixel because most Wear OS watches have been running on the same basic Qualcomm chipset,
[2797.60 → 2801.92] which is not particularly speedy since 2014.
[2801.92 → 2809.76] Now, the Snapdragon Wear 4100 did come out last summer, but watches that use it are few and far between.
[2810.76 → 2814.92] Prosser says we could see the Pixel Watch launch this fall with new Pixel phones, but...
[2814.92 → 2817.88] Actually, no, maybe.
[2818.08 → 2819.78] I mean, they acquired Fitbit in 2019.
[2820.10 → 2823.02] You look at sort of typical hardware release timeframes.
[2823.72 → 2824.40] Yeah, okay.
[2825.32 → 2825.72] Okay.
[2826.12 → 2826.44] Well...
[2826.44 → 2827.98] Unless they've killed the project by then.
[2827.98 → 2832.02] Unless they've killed the entire concept by then.
[2832.42 → 2832.94] Poor Stadia.
[2833.06 → 2838.40] You know, I actually did a video today talking about Stadia on the LTT channel, believe it or not.
[2839.28 → 2842.14] So it's as crazy as it sounds.
[2842.52 → 2842.82] Okay?
[2843.48 → 2844.38] Luke, here's the thing.
[2845.12 → 2846.64] You can't buy a graphics card.
[2848.02 → 2848.10] So...
[2848.10 → 2849.04] Okay.
[2849.48 → 2849.88] Okay.
[2849.88 → 2852.56] So were you going over, like, different services that you can use?
[2852.66 → 2853.92] So that's the premise of the video.
[2854.02 → 2854.52] We went...
[2854.52 → 2860.46] We tried all the ones that were reasonably attainable to get access to.
[2860.88 → 2864.46] Shadow Tech is technically a thing, but their waitlist is super long.
[2864.46 → 2864.88] I was going to ask.
[2865.44 → 2866.14] And they're like...
[2866.14 → 2866.32] Oh, good.
[2867.00 → 2874.82] You know whether or not they're actually rolling out new servers and taking on new customers seems sort of questionable at best right now.
[2875.46 → 2875.82] Right.
[2875.82 → 2877.36] So we tried all the main ones.
[2877.46 → 2878.82] We run through the pros and cons.
[2879.40 → 2882.98] We talk about sort of the latency responsiveness of them.
[2883.34 → 2893.82] And boil it down to what we think is a solid recommendation for gamers who want to game but don't want to spend, you know, an extra...
[2893.82 → 2902.10] I think what it worked out to was I looked at the average sell price for an RTX 3070 on eBay compared to NVIDIA's published MSRP.
[2902.40 → 2904.84] And the difference was $850.
[2905.64 → 2910.76] And when you think about that, that's a lot of money, obviously.
[2911.14 → 2917.76] But then you drill into it, and it's like, no, that is a lot of money.
[2917.84 → 2921.86] That is the difference between buying an RTX 3070 and a 3080.
[2921.86 → 2930.58] That is the difference between buying an RTX 3070 for yourself and your SO and buying just one for yourself.
[2930.72 → 2935.14] That's the difference between buying a high-end card like six years ago or not buying a graphics card at all.
[2935.24 → 2942.62] That's the difference between feeding a scalper and buying yourself a game streaming service for five years.
[2942.62 → 2951.50] That's actually what I was just going to say is that that gap is probably enough that, like, if you just sell your current card,
[2951.50 → 2958.72] use the money from that to power a game streaming service, which I don't like this, to be completely clear.
[2959.12 → 2962.18] And everyone watching that has been watching for a while probably knows that.
[2962.28 → 2965.14] I'm just putting it out there just because someone else might.
[2965.14 → 2972.80] You can sell your current gaming card and ride on that until hopefully, oh my goodness, hopefully the silicon shortage goes away.
[2973.00 → 2981.20] And we danced around that particular suggestion of just, you know, effectively scalping your current card
[2981.20 → 2987.74] and then riding on cloud gaming until it's time to rebuy it at half the price or whatever.
[2987.74 → 2994.92] But I'm sure people will, you know, come up with their own optimization strategies in terms of how to weather the current climate.
[2995.22 → 2996.90] And that, sorry.
[2997.48 → 3008.46] And I'm not going to lie if I didn't say, you know, that kind of thing would definitely have occurred to the who didn't have easier access to hardware, right?
[3008.54 → 3012.02] Like, it's a totally valid start, right?
[3012.44 → 3017.32] And that could be a net benefit to people who are trying to get their hands on a graphics card.
[3017.32 → 3020.80] If we got a glut of supply from people that are just like, you know what?
[3021.20 → 3022.60] F*** it, I'm out, right?
[3023.50 → 3024.06] I'm out.
[3024.48 → 3025.58] I'm going to cloud gaming.
[3026.02 → 3037.86] That could actually help things return to a degree of normalcy is what I would say if I didn't believe that the supply situation was going to become even worse in the coming months.
[3037.86 → 3048.86] Yeah, and that's what I was just going to say is like, that start might also just leave you in a few years with none of that money still remaining and graphics cards being in an even worse or just as bad spot.
[3049.22 → 3050.78] And now you're just stuck.
[3050.90 → 3057.60] I think in a few years, it's unlikely that we will still be in the situation we're in today.
[3057.60 → 3061.58] But I would be surprised if it's cleared up in a year.
[3061.98 → 3064.24] And I think the pricing ramifications might stay.
[3064.88 → 3069.10] I kind of suspect manufacturers are going to take advantage of that personally.
[3069.28 → 3074.12] You know, I wish I could say that I thought, I wish I could say I disagree.
[3074.12 → 3077.48] But I don't know if I can do that.
[3077.56 → 3080.72] I think in the longer term, it will return to normal.
[3080.80 → 3082.30] You look at hard drives, for example.
[3082.30 → 3086.82] They've had a lot of downward pricing pressure since they shot up around the time of the Thailand floods.
[3087.48 → 3087.54] Yeah.
[3087.76 → 3101.48] But with that said, hard drives have also been overall a declining product category, whereas graphics cards, I don't think gaming is losing any popularity anytime soon.
[3101.48 → 3104.90] So they just might not be under the same kind of pressure.
[3104.90 → 3119.42] And now that this new normal has been established where a high-end graphics card starts at, you know, $1,300 for not even the top tier, we might be stuck with something similar for a long time.
[3119.50 → 3129.36] Our only hope, go freaking figure, is if Intel storms into the gaming GPU space and is legitimately competitive.
[3129.36 → 3131.86] Can you imagine that?
[3132.18 → 3143.52] Scrappy underdog Intel, because in that space they would be, coming in and restoring competition to a market that's dominated by a monopoly or duopoly.
[3144.54 → 3147.68] What timeline are we on, Luke?
[3149.18 → 3150.36] A bad one.
[3150.60 → 3152.12] I don't even know anymore.
[3152.46 → 3154.36] I can't play this game anymore.
[3154.44 → 3155.26] It's not fun.
[3155.26 → 3163.54] Someone said that John tweeted out saying that the watch has been cancelled, but I couldn't find the tweet.
[3163.90 → 3164.02] Oh.
[3164.60 → 3165.00] All right.
[3165.18 → 3167.10] Well, duly noted.
[3167.22 → 3168.28] Take that for what it is.
[3168.70 → 3168.92] Yeah.
[3169.12 → 3170.54] So maybe look into that.
[3170.62 → 3171.08] Maybe don't.
[3171.32 → 3171.82] We're moving on.
[3172.54 → 3178.72] Speaking of people who don't want to play anymore and are moving on, LG is out of the phone business.
[3178.94 → 3179.22] Yes.
[3179.22 → 3182.50] Go ahead.
[3182.62 → 3183.46] Man, I hate that delay.
[3183.62 → 3186.08] We got to, the podcast set is almost done at the office.
[3186.20 → 3188.28] We got to go back to hosting this next to each other.
[3188.36 → 3189.66] I think there's just no way around it.
[3189.90 → 3191.76] I want my shot as soon as possible.
[3192.02 → 3193.84] I will be right in line for it.
[3194.46 → 3196.64] And do you have a timeline for yours?
[3196.72 → 3198.88] I think I'm pretty low on eligibility.
[3199.16 → 3199.44] Yeah.
[3199.68 → 3200.14] Cool.
[3200.70 → 3201.36] But yeah.
[3201.92 → 3207.52] So my most, most interesting thing about this to me is going to be, I love that someone made these notes.
[3207.60 → 3208.86] So I'm going to be really excited to go through it.
[3208.92 → 3214.20] But in a second, well, we'll reminisce about the various important phones that, that LG did release.
[3214.22 → 3215.54] And some of them are like pretty big deal.
[3215.54 → 3221.86] But to go through the previous notes first, LG is the next company to pack its bags and leave the mobile phone business.
[3221.98 → 3224.46] There's been a lot over the last X amount of years.
[3224.46 → 3231.46] The company confirmed this week that we'll focus on electric vehicle components, connected devices, appliances, and more.
[3231.58 → 3233.64] LG has its hands in tons of different things.
[3233.80 → 3233.96] Oh, yeah.
[3234.02 → 3235.50] So LG is going nowhere.
[3235.86 → 3237.20] They're just out of the phone business.
[3237.20 → 3237.78] That's all.
[3238.32 → 3244.26] The phone division has been suffering from operating losses and has been looking at ways to move on.
[3244.70 → 3246.92] It doesn't say a timeframe, but probably for a while.
[3247.14 → 3248.18] I think, I think we've been.
[3248.36 → 3250.20] The rumours have been circulating for literally years.
[3250.72 → 3250.96] Yeah.
[3251.06 → 3251.18] Yeah.
[3251.18 → 3251.46] Yeah.
[3252.40 → 3253.86] They've been trying to sell it.
[3253.86 → 3259.06] Maybe split part of it off and sell just that or, or, or other various options.
[3259.06 → 3262.48] But it appears that they decided to just fail.
[3263.16 → 3272.00] Current smartphone owners should continue to get upgrades for an I'm assuming this is Android upgrades for an unspecified amount of time.
[3272.08 → 3276.48] The company claiming that Android 12 upgrade will also be provided to some models.
[3277.02 → 3279.08] Existing inventory will remain available for sale.
[3279.08 → 3283.42] If you want to achieve your smartphone with a limited future.
[3284.56 → 3285.04] Yeah.
[3285.46 → 3287.12] Although, yeah, I don't know.
[3287.32 → 3288.64] That's a little rough, but yeah.
[3288.64 → 3291.56] Anyway, going through the history of LG phones.
[3293.24 → 3297.60] There's a few here that I think were pretty important, but I'm going to go through all of them.
[3297.70 → 3299.84] The LG is a bad name.
[3300.06 → 3301.92] The LG VX 9400.
[3302.80 → 3305.68] It was a flip screen predecessor to the LG wing.
[3305.76 → 3308.64] It had integrated TV antenna for mobile video watching.
[3308.74 → 3309.48] These all have links.
[3309.70 → 3310.34] You can open these up.
[3310.42 → 3310.80] I'm a favourite.
[3310.80 → 3311.20] Okay.
[3312.00 → 3313.72] That thing is, is awesome.
[3313.90 → 3314.68] I remember that.
[3314.86 → 3319.24] I definitely did not have one, but it was very interesting.
[3319.72 → 3320.96] It was interesting.
[3321.10 → 3321.72] Yeah, definitely.
[3322.82 → 3329.74] The LG Prada, the first all capacitive touchscreen phone announced less than a month before the iPhone.
[3329.74 → 3333.26] The LG ENV or IBO.
[3333.58 → 3334.58] This was a pretty big deal.
[3335.08 → 3339.86] Flip out keyboard phone that a lot of teenagers had before moving on to smartphones.
[3340.10 → 3340.86] I think this.
[3342.20 → 3346.38] Yeah, this is not the one that I had, but it's pretty similar.
[3347.16 → 3347.96] NV squared.
[3348.30 → 3348.64] Love it.
[3349.68 → 3350.18] That was.
[3352.76 → 3353.50] I'm back.
[3353.68 → 3354.44] And so is my voice.
[3354.56 → 3357.02] That was a pretty influential phone at the time.
[3357.52 → 3358.44] Now, here we go.
[3358.44 → 3360.52] The LG Nexus 4 and Nexus 5.
[3360.68 → 3363.22] They were decent, affordable phones with Android at its purest.
[3363.40 → 3367.58] The reasons why they land here is because, yeah, decent, affordable at Android.
[3367.74 → 3369.18] These are in a lot of people's pockets.
[3369.60 → 3369.74] Yep.
[3369.90 → 3371.84] Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 were big.
[3372.12 → 3374.00] Those were pretty major phones.
[3374.20 → 3375.66] I think the 4 more than the 5.
[3376.58 → 3377.06] It's funny.
[3377.18 → 3383.76] Google has gone through a lot of different sorts of phases as they've matured in the smartphone market.
[3383.76 → 3388.34] They went from, you know, we're just going to keep out of the hardware game to nobody's really doing
[3388.34 → 3388.82] this right.
[3388.90 → 3395.02] We're going to get involved to, like, it needs to be Android needs to compete on being super
[3395.02 → 3395.46] affordable.
[3395.72 → 3397.66] Everything you need, nothing you don't to.
[3398.06 → 3399.02] We want to get premium.
[3399.16 → 3404.50] We want to cost as much as an iPhone and justify it somehow to with this like pixel line.
[3404.50 → 3409.32] And then pixel got kind of bastardized somewhere along the way.
[3409.32 → 3413.42] And it's like, yeah, it's a pixel, but like it's actually really cheap, and it's everything you need
[3413.42 → 3414.30] and nothing you don't.
[3414.68 → 3415.36] I don't know.
[3415.42 → 3415.74] They just.
[3416.36 → 3421.06] Let's make fun of the headphone jack going away and then take it away from our own phone
[3421.06 → 3422.68] and then put it back on some of them.
[3422.84 → 3423.20] Yeah.
[3423.42 → 3425.00] And then who knows?
[3425.58 → 3427.16] And then their last hurrah.
[3427.44 → 3427.66] Sorry.
[3427.82 → 3428.00] Nope.
[3428.08 → 3428.88] There's one more before that.
[3428.96 → 3430.12] The LG G5.
[3430.56 → 3431.94] This was another interesting phone.
[3432.26 → 3435.60] Replaceable battery and friends modular attachments.
[3435.60 → 3439.44] Also, the power button was, you know, unreliable.
[3439.78 → 3445.38] But that was a weird phone, but it was kind of cool.
[3445.80 → 3446.20] Yeah.
[3446.20 → 3450.56] That like slide out thing was super honestly dumb.
[3452.46 → 3453.26] They were trying.
[3453.40 → 3454.52] They tried stuff.
[3455.40 → 3460.06] They definitely tried stuff like the LG Wing, which they still have an official product page
[3460.06 → 3460.50] up for.
[3461.24 → 3463.22] This thing is just really weird.
[3463.22 → 3465.88] I kind of want to grab one just as like a collector's item.
[3466.80 → 3467.58] Yeah, maybe.
[3467.82 → 3469.12] JK, no one will collect these.
[3469.90 → 3475.52] I do like the LG often went pretty out of the box with things when it came to phones.
[3475.96 → 3476.04] But.
[3476.54 → 3485.56] And you know what I like is LG was one of the last bastions of caring at all about audiophiles
[3485.56 → 3488.90] who want to listen to high quality music on their phone over a wire.
[3490.30 → 3493.36] They hung out longer than anyone else.
[3493.46 → 3499.24] In spite of all the noise Samsung made about supporting that user group, LG actually did
[3499.24 → 3502.02] it for way, way longer.
[3502.26 → 3504.26] So massive respect to them for that.
[3505.76 → 3509.12] Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep them going.
[3509.12 → 3509.56] Yeah.
[3511.84 → 3513.64] And that's that's kind of it.
[3513.72 → 3516.14] I had a few LG phones throughout the years.
[3516.14 → 3520.76] And I one thing that I always liked about all of them is they felt kind of like tanks
[3520.76 → 3524.40] compared to most other smartphones that I had used.
[3524.48 → 3526.20] They survived through a lot of stuff.
[3526.20 → 3532.20] But yeah, they've kind of fallen from grace a little bit, and it's kind of sad to see them
[3532.20 → 3537.32] go, but they also haven't really been in very positive news for quite a while.
[3537.48 → 3538.46] So I'm not too surprised.
[3538.68 → 3545.08] So can we talk about Twitch, Twitch's new policy of monitoring streamers off platform
[3545.08 → 3548.32] and taking action against them on platform?
[3549.42 → 3554.68] Yeah, I honestly don't know enough about this, but it's its interesting.
[3554.68 → 3558.48] I mean, we sort of saw this happen with a different platform, right?
[3558.52 → 3559.72] We saw this happen with Patreon.
[3560.64 → 3564.00] And this was a huge blow up for Patreon.
[3565.26 → 3569.28] But I think Twitch is trying to get more preemptive with it.
[3569.90 → 3574.32] So they're trying to set this up because Patreon's like they hadn't established precedent
[3574.32 → 3575.36] for that at all.
[3575.82 → 3578.98] And it seems like Twitch is trying to set this up beforehand.
[3580.34 → 3583.98] So I won't say that they're trying to get out ahead of it.
[3583.98 → 3589.48] I would say they're trying to dig themselves out from behind a problem here.
[3589.64 → 3591.70] So let's run through what's happening here.
[3591.78 → 3598.10] So Twitch, for those not familiar, is a streaming service where a lot of gamers play a lot of
[3598.10 → 3603.70] video games and do a lot of other stuff, body painting or IRL type stuff.
[3604.02 → 3606.68] Let's just chatting kind of all that kind of stuff.
[3606.78 → 3609.62] OK, so you can kind of stream eating.
[3609.62 → 3611.82] You can stream pretty much anything these days.
[3613.64 → 3617.34] And what they're they have all kinds of rules, though.
[3617.70 → 3622.18] So even though you can kind of do anything, they do have rules for what you are not allowed
[3622.18 → 3622.60] to do.
[3622.68 → 3627.86] For example, Twitch streamers have gotten in hot water for doing all kinds of stuff on stream.
[3627.86 → 3630.76] I mean, we're talking like real bad stuff.
[3630.84 → 3632.72] Spousal abuse, animal abuse.
[3634.00 → 3640.84] You know, inadvertent nudity, inadvertent nudity, both the kinds of inadvertent nudity.
[3643.50 → 3647.82] But what they OK, let's let's go ahead, though.
[3647.92 → 3649.26] So Twitch is a streaming platform.
[3649.46 → 3649.76] All right.
[3649.76 → 3655.32] And they've announced they will be monitoring streamers activity, not just on platform for
[3655.32 → 3659.72] adherence to their code of conduct, but also off platform.
[3660.46 → 3664.76] So Twitch's mods could come at you with one of two categories.
[3665.42 → 3668.60] Category one is you harassing someone.
[3669.22 → 3675.38] So what they say is verifiable off service behaviours or statements that relate to an incident
[3675.38 → 3682.14] will be taken into account whether the incident took place on Twitch or somewhere else or category two.
[3682.50 → 3688.04] You do any of the following deadly violence or violent extremism, terrorist activities or recruiting,
[3688.56 → 3694.06] explicit or credible threats of mass violence, leadership or membership in a known hate group,
[3694.50 → 3699.34] carrying out or being complicit in non-consensual sexual activities or sexual assault,
[3699.96 → 3703.98] sexual exploitation of children, including child grooming slash solicitation,
[3703.98 → 3707.04] and distributed distribution of underage sexual material,
[3707.74 → 3712.30] actions that would directly and explicitly compromise the physical safety of the Twitch community
[3712.30 → 3716.60] and explicit or credible threats against Twitch, including Twitch staff.
[3716.76 → 3719.06] And the list is not exhaustive.
[3719.80 → 3725.02] So one thing about category two is at least the things that were listed there is it's basically crimes.
[3725.26 → 3726.80] Yeah, it's all illegal.
[3728.06 → 3733.64] As for how Twitch is going to prevent false reports and abuse, because I don't know about you, Luke.
[3733.64 → 3734.38] That's going to be real.
[3734.38 → 3737.40] I think it's possible that within the gaming community,
[3738.02 → 3742.64] some people for various reasons might make false reports.
[3742.64 → 3746.06] Do you think that is possible within the broader gaming community?
[3746.66 → 3747.20] I don't know.
[3747.30 → 3751.72] I think, you know, maybe some people could stoop to that level.
[3752.06 → 3753.94] But yeah, I know that's going to be pretty intense.
[3754.08 → 3758.02] Apparently, Twitch says that all claims are to be substantiated
[3758.02 → 3761.32] before any action related to the user's report is taken.
[3761.48 → 3766.28] An action will only be taken where a preponderance of evidence exists.
[3766.90 → 3770.14] I don't know if that means beyond all reasonable doubt, you know,
[3770.20 → 3773.28] like how it would if this was a legal proceeding or not.
[3773.40 → 3775.60] But whatever a preponderance of evidence is,
[3775.92 → 3779.36] and no action will be taken while an account is still under investigation.
[3780.02 → 3782.12] Accounts submitting large amounts of frivolous reports
[3782.12 → 3784.26] are encouraging others to do the same will be suspended.
[3785.16 → 3789.88] And now I guess we get into the part where we're talking about
[3789.88 → 3792.16] how this came to be.
[3792.20 → 3792.90] One quick second.
[3793.10 → 3793.22] Yeah.
[3793.42 → 3794.36] Preponderance of evidence.
[3794.92 → 3795.96] Related content.
[3796.32 → 3799.52] The standard of proof commonly used in civil litigation.
[3800.04 → 3802.40] So would it stand up in court?
[3803.34 → 3803.76] All right.
[3804.10 → 3805.90] But then who is the actual judge of that?
[3805.98 → 3806.84] Are they a lawyer?
[3807.66 → 3808.32] Yeah, I don't know.
[3808.32 → 3808.68] Okay.
[3809.06 → 3812.92] So anyway, where is this coming from?
[3813.08 → 3816.10] So there are a lot of reasons for people to be upset about this
[3816.10 → 3821.14] because basically Twitch has now moved beyond their private platform,
[3821.36 → 3824.82] but they have moved their policing beyond their private platform
[3824.82 → 3826.48] where ultimately you can kind of say,
[3826.60 → 3830.76] well, look, you know, your toy, your rules.
[3831.20 → 3832.32] So, you know, fine.
[3832.46 → 3833.92] But now they're basically saying,
[3834.04 → 3836.74] well, our rules extend beyond the use of our toy
[3836.74 → 3837.94] into the use of other toys.
[3838.32 → 3843.38] I think that everything that they've got listed is pretty fair
[3843.38 → 3846.90] and a pretty valid reason to deplatform someone.
[3847.06 → 3850.54] But I think where many people are getting caught on this,
[3850.98 → 3851.70] or not caught,
[3851.86 → 3854.30] but where many people are getting upset about this
[3854.30 → 3859.74] is that there does appear to be at least the possibility
[3859.74 → 3862.32] of a slippery slope
[3862.32 → 3868.78] and the possibility that Twitch could play the role of judge, jury, and executioner.
[3870.12 → 3871.68] I mean, they already have, though.
[3871.74 → 3873.32] In a way they're not qualified to.
[3873.90 → 3874.60] Twitch is mod.
[3874.70 → 3875.80] But that precedence is there.
[3875.94 → 3878.44] They axed Dr. Disrespect.
[3878.70 → 3880.38] Well, we don't know why, though.
[3880.38 → 3884.02] So we don't know that they didn't have a fantastic reason.
[3884.76 → 3887.20] And I think if...
[3887.20 → 3889.40] If he's to be believed, he doesn't either.
[3890.12 → 3892.18] No, I don't think he ever said that.
[3892.38 → 3894.42] I think what he said is that Twitch didn't tell him.
[3894.86 → 3897.28] I don't think he ever actually said he doesn't know.
[3897.28 → 3898.16] Okay.
[3898.16 → 3900.66] So don't quote me on that,
[3900.88 → 3905.48] but I doubt that he has no idea.
[3906.38 → 3908.90] I just don't buy it.
[3909.64 → 3909.88] Okay.
[3910.34 → 3912.40] Yeah, that's my hot take.
[3912.62 → 3913.72] That's my hot take on that.
[3914.50 → 3916.42] But the bigger issue here,
[3916.52 → 3918.16] aside from just the...
[3918.16 → 3920.58] There's a slippery slope kind of argument to be made,
[3920.58 → 3927.72] is that Twitch's history of enforcement is spotty at best.
[3928.04 → 3932.46] Even of the rules and guidelines that they already have for their own site,
[3932.82 → 3934.98] let alone off-platform.
[3935.18 → 3938.98] And I think they have a trust problem among the community
[3938.98 → 3942.52] that makes it hard to take them seriously.
[3942.74 → 3946.06] Like they are actually going to be going about this in good faith
[3946.06 → 3948.72] and applying these rules consistently.
[3948.72 → 3952.76] The problem is that I don't see what choice Twitch has
[3952.76 → 3957.90] because here's another hot take that may get me into some trouble.
[3958.06 → 3959.26] People might not agree with this,
[3959.36 → 3963.12] but I think that Twitch's back is kind of against a wall here.
[3963.22 → 3964.54] I think they have to do this
[3964.54 → 3967.58] because Twitch has a different image problem.
[3968.76 → 3972.48] Twitch ends up being this nexus of controversy
[3972.48 → 3978.76] more often than I think just about any other online platform.
[3978.90 → 3980.16] And I don't know what it is.
[3980.28 → 3981.80] The nature of live-streaming,
[3982.06 → 3983.94] the nature of the gaming community,
[3984.28 → 3987.24] the nature of the Twitch community in particular,
[3987.82 → 3992.48] the way that the Twitch audience is so dialled in to social media
[3992.48 → 3993.82] and things get amplified.
[3994.16 → 3995.76] I don't know what it is.
[3996.12 → 3996.48] But if there is...
[3996.48 → 3998.20] Live chats are harder to moderate.
[3998.20 → 4002.78] If there is an online controversy,
[4003.46 → 4008.46] the odds that it stems from Twitch TV is higher
[4008.46 → 4011.34] than the odds that it stems from almost anywhere else
[4011.34 → 4013.64] with maybe the exception to YouTube.
[4014.38 → 4018.10] And so for the sake of protecting its own brand
[4018.10 → 4021.86] and the credibility and brand of the streamers
[4021.86 → 4023.52] who do play by the rules
[4023.52 → 4026.38] and not engage in terrorist activities
[4026.38 → 4028.90] or sexual exploitation of children,
[4029.24 → 4030.52] Ada, Ada, that entire list.
[4030.54 → 4031.82] I suspect people aren't going to be too concerned
[4031.82 → 4033.14] about category two existing.
[4033.58 → 4035.08] I think people are only really going to be concerned
[4035.08 → 4036.20] about category one existing.
[4036.48 → 4039.16] So either way, either way,
[4039.48 → 4041.78] in order for Twitch to protect their own brand
[4041.78 → 4043.02] and not just their own brand,
[4043.10 → 4045.64] but the brand of the people who use the platform,
[4045.98 → 4047.20] I don't see what choice they had.
[4047.20 → 4048.68] Because as a YouTuber,
[4048.84 → 4050.52] this is kind of like...
[4050.52 → 4052.06] It's something I don't talk about often.
[4052.48 → 4053.66] But as a YouTuber,
[4054.08 → 4056.62] people have kind of in their mind
[4056.62 → 4058.06] what a word like that means.
[4058.64 → 4060.54] You know whether it's the word influencer
[4060.54 → 4063.70] or YouTuber or Twitch streamer,
[4064.28 → 4067.80] there is a certain kind of generalization
[4067.80 → 4070.54] that takes place about any group of people.
[4070.96 → 4073.24] And it's never right to do,
[4073.50 → 4076.32] but it always happens whether we like it or not.
[4076.32 → 4078.06] And so as a YouTuber,
[4078.66 → 4081.18] personally, every time I read in the news
[4081.18 → 4083.04] that some famous YouTuber
[4083.04 → 4085.58] was sexting with a minor again,
[4085.72 → 4086.70] I'm sitting here going,
[4087.06 → 4088.00] all right, well,
[4088.14 → 4091.20] that's another sort of side-eyes glance
[4091.20 → 4092.76] that I'm going to have to see
[4092.76 → 4094.06] when I'm in mixed company
[4094.06 → 4095.98] and I say, yes, I'm a YouTuber.
[4096.42 → 4097.02] And people are like,
[4098.20 → 4099.48] oh, right,
[4099.64 → 4100.78] those web personalities
[4100.78 → 4103.08] that abuse their positions of power
[4103.08 → 4105.88] and groom minors for sexual favours.
[4105.88 → 4106.28] Cool.
[4107.24 → 4107.68] Huh.
[4107.98 → 4109.80] I wonder, you know,
[4110.54 → 4113.48] is he scouting out the minors
[4113.48 → 4115.20] at this get-together right now?
[4115.20 → 4116.34] Or is he like friends with that person
[4116.34 → 4117.44] or whatever else?
[4117.44 → 4117.74] People generalize.
[4117.74 → 4119.36] Because there's other stuff too.
[4119.56 → 4119.70] Yeah.
[4119.84 → 4123.46] And so I understand why they are doing it.
[4123.46 → 4125.22] But the thing is too,
[4125.32 → 4126.64] as an online creator,
[4126.64 → 4128.34] I have an inherent distrust
[4128.34 → 4129.58] of the platforms
[4129.58 → 4131.36] that we are reliant on,
[4131.42 → 4132.66] be it Twitch or YouTube
[4132.66 → 4134.42] or actually float planes.
[4134.56 → 4134.78] All right.
[4134.84 → 4135.34] Good job, Luke.
[4135.42 → 4135.72] Float planes.
[4135.82 → 4135.94] Cool.
[4136.18 → 4138.20] But I have this inherent distrust
[4138.20 → 4138.90] of these platforms
[4138.90 → 4140.74] because their enforcement standards
[4140.74 → 4142.62] are so inconsistent
[4142.62 → 4144.52] that we just don't know
[4144.52 → 4146.20] what to freaking expect from them.
[4146.42 → 4148.98] So I don't see what choice Twitch had,
[4149.30 → 4152.56] but I'm also made extremely uncomfortable
[4152.56 → 4153.64] by this move.
[4153.74 → 4155.44] So I just don't really know how to feel.
[4155.56 → 4155.72] There.
[4155.88 → 4157.26] That is the long and short of it.
[4160.86 → 4161.34] Yeah.
[4162.34 → 4162.94] There's...
[4162.94 → 4164.80] Definitely makes me uncomfortable,
[4164.80 → 4166.02] but at the same time,
[4166.92 → 4170.06] if you saw a...
[4170.06 → 4171.80] This is way, way, way smaller scale.
[4172.36 → 4177.52] But say you're watching a live stream,
[4177.88 → 4179.62] a Kyle live stream.
[4179.86 → 4180.14] Sure.
[4180.88 → 4181.52] Like Bigwig Kyle?
[4182.38 → 4183.06] Bigwig Kyle.
[4183.16 → 4183.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4184.10 → 4185.78] He has a new live-streaming thing.
[4185.88 → 4186.84] I think it's called Workhorse,
[4186.98 → 4188.06] but with the vowels taken out
[4188.06 → 4188.66] or something like that.
[4188.98 → 4190.42] So you're watching Workhorse.
[4190.62 → 4190.80] Sure.
[4190.80 → 4191.84] You're having a great time.
[4192.02 → 4192.72] You're enjoying it.
[4192.82 → 4194.12] And then somebody jumps in chat
[4194.12 → 4195.62] and just starts popping off.
[4196.20 → 4196.32] Sure.
[4198.00 → 4200.16] Racism, sexism, swear words,
[4200.30 → 4202.26] very vulgar stuff,
[4202.50 → 4203.66] trying to recruit people to,
[4203.82 → 4205.18] I don't know, terrorist organizations,
[4205.44 → 4207.06] whatever other things are in that list.
[4209.64 → 4210.88] Would you...
[4210.88 → 4213.36] If you knew that person was on the forum,
[4213.88 → 4215.32] would you want to ban them from the forum?
[4215.90 → 4217.08] I would want to,
[4217.24 → 4219.72] but it is against our policy at this time
[4219.72 → 4221.98] to take any kind of action
[4221.98 → 4223.36] against people on the forum
[4223.36 → 4228.02] based on incidents that took place off the forum.
[4229.24 → 4230.74] So I get it.
[4230.74 → 4232.48] This is another way of me copping out
[4232.48 → 4235.66] and saying I see both sides of this one.
[4237.24 → 4237.68] Yeah.
[4237.68 → 4238.12] Yeah.
[4238.24 → 4239.34] I don't have...
[4239.34 → 4241.56] I don't have a good solution to that
[4241.56 → 4242.52] because if this person
[4242.52 → 4244.40] is on their best behaviour,
[4244.66 → 4245.96] onlineistechtips.com
[4245.96 → 4247.30] and does nothing but help people
[4247.30 → 4248.98] configure their computers properly
[4248.98 → 4252.60] and obeys our site,
[4252.76 → 4254.62] you know, guidelines,
[4254.76 → 4255.54] which is effectively,
[4255.76 → 4256.04] you know,
[4256.12 → 4257.24] be excellent to each other
[4257.24 → 4258.12] and don't be a dick,
[4258.46 → 4258.74] right?
[4259.10 → 4260.88] Then what am I supposed to say?
[4261.52 → 4263.76] See, already we've got a mixed response to this.
[4263.76 → 4264.84] Ferna182 says,
[4264.92 → 4266.80] I would 100% support banning those people
[4266.80 → 4267.96] and Blue Sky says,
[4268.04 → 4268.66] it's a bad idea.
[4268.76 → 4269.02] It's like,
[4269.10 → 4269.54] there you go.
[4269.76 → 4271.52] We are 50-50 already
[4271.52 → 4272.64] in the flow plane chat.
[4272.82 → 4274.54] It took like eight seconds.
[4275.48 → 4276.32] Verification's a problem.
[4276.42 → 4277.98] Is this actually the same person?
[4278.22 → 4278.76] Of course.
[4279.76 → 4281.50] There are lots of other problems there.
[4281.58 → 4282.94] There's also the potential problem of,
[4283.30 → 4283.56] I mean,
[4283.66 → 4285.26] that's Kyle's channel
[4285.26 → 4286.68] and I chose Kyle for a reason.
[4286.68 → 4287.94] It's actually fairly likely
[4287.94 → 4289.54] that some of Kyle's audience
[4289.54 → 4292.16] might be on Delta T forum.
[4292.30 → 4293.20] There's some crossover there.
[4293.36 → 4295.70] So that person may have attacked
[4295.70 → 4296.74] or offended or whatever,
[4297.48 → 4297.98] deeply,
[4298.30 → 4299.66] like in very brutal,
[4299.86 → 4300.86] not okay ways,
[4301.26 → 4303.72] people that are on the forum.
[4303.94 → 4304.16] Yep.
[4304.58 → 4306.14] And they might run into them on the forum.
[4306.50 → 4307.74] And then those other people
[4307.74 → 4309.52] are expected to be civil with that person
[4309.52 → 4310.70] now on this other medium.
[4310.90 → 4311.20] Like it,
[4311.68 → 4314.32] the waters get really kind of gross.
[4314.32 → 4316.38] So,
[4316.38 → 4318.06] Gatorade OW says,
[4318.18 → 4318.86] grooming is something
[4318.86 → 4320.10] very much more present
[4320.10 → 4321.12] in music and cinema
[4321.12 → 4322.12] than online creators.
[4322.26 → 4323.52] And that's fair enough.
[4323.62 → 4323.84] I mean,
[4323.92 → 4324.26] if you know,
[4324.30 → 4326.34] you want to talk about sort of,
[4326.34 → 4330.04] you want to talk about sort of
[4330.04 → 4331.88] whether it's celebrity culture
[4331.88 → 4334.06] or whether it's,
[4334.06 → 4335.04] you know,
[4335.30 → 4336.06] big business
[4336.06 → 4336.86] where lots of money
[4336.86 → 4338.16] is being made culture,
[4338.64 → 4338.86] you know,
[4338.90 → 4339.18] whatever.
[4339.30 → 4339.50] We could,
[4339.54 → 4340.70] we could have those conversations.
[4340.70 → 4342.36] But the reality of it is,
[4342.36 → 4342.88] as,
[4342.88 → 4344.30] as news coverage,
[4344.32 → 4346.30] and as news consumption
[4346.30 → 4347.60] shifts online,
[4347.60 → 4349.68] there is an inherent
[4349.68 → 4351.68] reporting bias
[4351.68 → 4353.18] towards creators
[4353.18 → 4354.86] online.
[4355.26 → 4355.84] There's also,
[4356.16 → 4356.86] just like,
[4356.98 → 4357.20] it's,
[4357.20 → 4358.18] it's also more shocking
[4358.18 → 4359.86] because with like
[4359.86 → 4360.74] some movie star
[4360.74 → 4361.48] or athlete,
[4361.48 → 4362.62] you don't think
[4362.62 → 4363.48] you have a personal
[4363.48 → 4364.70] relationship with them.
[4364.86 → 4365.74] You don't think
[4365.74 → 4366.68] you know who they are.
[4366.74 → 4367.44] And in some ways,
[4367.44 → 4368.80] they are already
[4368.80 → 4371.02] viewed through that lens
[4371.02 → 4371.40] of like,
[4371.48 → 4371.62] oh,
[4371.62 → 4371.80] well,
[4371.80 → 4372.26] they're probably
[4372.26 → 4373.26] a Hollywood elite
[4373.26 → 4374.26] or they're probably
[4374.26 → 4375.52] like a scumbag
[4375.52 → 4376.66] athlete who
[4376.66 → 4378.00] goes to the club
[4378.00 → 4378.88] and gets a bunch
[4378.88 → 4379.34] of COVID
[4379.34 → 4380.68] and spreads it
[4380.68 → 4381.60] among their teammates
[4381.60 → 4382.80] or whatever the case
[4382.80 → 4383.36] may be.
[4383.46 → 4383.66] Like,
[4383.70 → 4384.26] you already kind of
[4384.26 → 4385.10] have these
[4385.10 → 4386.12] preconceptions,
[4386.32 → 4388.08] whereas this image
[4388.08 → 4389.42] shift with online
[4389.42 → 4390.36] creators is only
[4390.36 → 4391.04] taking place
[4391.04 → 4391.78] over the last few
[4391.78 → 4393.28] years as they get
[4393.28 → 4393.76] big enough
[4393.76 → 4394.40] and influential
[4394.40 → 4395.50] enough to start
[4395.50 → 4396.38] engaging in these
[4396.38 → 4397.24] sorts of behaviours.
[4397.24 → 4397.54] I mean,
[4397.56 → 4398.32] the reality of it
[4398.32 → 4398.98] is that people
[4398.98 → 4399.40] who are going
[4399.40 → 4399.94] to do these
[4399.94 → 4401.40] things are out
[4401.40 → 4402.46] there waiting
[4402.46 → 4403.48] for the opportunity.
[4403.92 → 4404.84] It's just a matter
[4404.84 → 4405.88] of now it's happening
[4405.88 → 4406.78] and now it's shocking
[4406.78 → 4408.06] because YouTubers
[4408.06 → 4409.20] and Twitch streamers,
[4409.30 → 4410.00] they're so much
[4410.00 → 4410.76] more accessible
[4410.76 → 4411.58] and so much more
[4411.58 → 4412.44] directly engaged
[4412.44 → 4413.30] with their audiences
[4413.30 → 4415.26] that I think
[4415.26 → 4416.20] it just like
[4416.20 → 4417.42] when that whole
[4417.42 → 4418.10] thing happened
[4418.10 → 4419.48] with Shay,
[4420.16 → 4421.56] what's his last name
[4421.56 → 4422.40] from the Standards?
[4423.48 → 4423.70] Shay Carl?
[4423.70 → 4424.64] Yeah, Shay Carl
[4424.64 → 4425.38] where he was like
[4425.38 → 4426.72] sexting a
[4428.04 → 4428.50] oh man,
[4428.54 → 4428.90] I forget.
[4429.12 → 4429.38] I don't think
[4429.38 → 4429.96] I even know about this.
[4430.08 → 4430.90] While you try
[4430.90 → 4431.38] to look that up,
[4431.48 → 4432.06] I was just going
[4432.06 → 4432.64] to say like
[4432.64 → 4433.84] they brought up
[4433.84 → 4434.50] the music
[4434.50 → 4436.28] and whatever other thing.
[4436.92 → 4438.08] I think it's going
[4438.08 → 4438.70] to be essentially
[4438.70 → 4440.14] anywhere where
[4440.14 → 4441.32] someone has a large
[4441.32 → 4442.10] amount of especially
[4442.10 → 4443.28] cultural influence
[4443.28 → 4444.92] over young people.
[4445.12 → 4445.38] Yep.
[4445.96 → 4447.70] The people that have
[4447.70 → 4449.14] these nefarious intentions,
[4449.14 → 4449.84] I keep looking
[4449.84 → 4450.46] into my webcam,
[4450.64 → 4451.40] it's the new camera,
[4451.56 → 4451.84] sorry,
[4451.98 → 4452.54] I'm not used
[4452.54 → 4453.08] to looking up there.
[4453.08 → 4453.82] People that have
[4453.82 → 4454.96] these nefarious intentions
[4454.96 → 4456.68] are likely going
[4456.68 → 4457.26] to look to try
[4457.26 → 4458.16] to abuse those routes.
[4458.40 → 4459.62] We very unfortunately
[4459.62 → 4460.62] saw it blow up
[4460.62 → 4461.10] in the competitive
[4461.10 → 4461.78] gaming scene.
[4462.88 → 4464.06] I know Super Smash Bros
[4464.06 → 4465.12] got gutted
[4465.12 → 4465.90] for a bit there.
[4466.36 → 4467.66] And there's a couple
[4467.66 → 4468.96] Super Smash Bros pros
[4468.96 → 4470.52] that I like to follow
[4470.52 → 4470.90] on Twitter
[4470.90 → 4471.66] and there was a few
[4471.66 → 4472.10] weeks there
[4472.10 → 4472.68] where I was like,
[4473.94 → 4474.74] please don't.
[4474.88 → 4475.64] Please don't, friend.
[4476.68 → 4478.96] I don't want like,
[4479.44 → 4480.28] I'm just hoping
[4480.28 → 4482.18] the two or three people
[4482.18 → 4483.28] that I follow in this space
[4483.28 → 4483.88] don't end up being
[4483.88 → 4484.82] complete scumbags.
[4484.90 → 4485.96] That would be fantastic.
[4486.32 → 4487.28] And it's so much
[4487.28 → 4488.10] more upsetting
[4488.10 → 4488.74] when it's someone
[4488.74 → 4489.40] that you like,
[4489.54 → 4490.12] thought you knew,
[4490.22 → 4490.48] you know?
[4490.66 → 4491.76] It's like when your neighbour
[4491.76 → 4492.82] turns out to be
[4492.82 → 4493.66] a serial killer
[4493.66 → 4495.60] versus when someone
[4495.60 → 4496.22] who like,
[4496.58 → 4497.48] lives on the other side
[4497.48 → 4497.96] of the country
[4497.96 → 4498.82] is a serial killer
[4498.82 → 4499.36] or whatever.
[4499.98 → 4500.62] You almost feel,
[4500.86 → 4501.84] because there's a
[4502.16 → 4502.44] there's,
[4502.92 → 4504.00] even if it's tiny,
[4504.06 → 4504.94] there's some modicum
[4504.94 → 4505.72] of trust there.
[4506.08 → 4506.48] Absolutely.
[4506.72 → 4507.48] You like this person,
[4507.56 → 4507.96] you follow them
[4507.96 → 4508.60] on social media,
[4508.74 → 4509.68] you follow their actions,
[4509.78 → 4510.18] you follow them
[4510.18 → 4510.80] through tournaments
[4510.80 → 4511.42] or whatever else.
[4511.42 → 4511.90] You're invested in them.
[4512.06 → 4512.74] You're invested.
[4513.10 → 4514.12] And then when they turn out
[4514.12 → 4515.26] to be just a piece of,
[4515.50 → 4516.62] I don't have the bleep button,
[4517.14 → 4519.88] it sucks.
[4520.02 → 4520.40] And it is like,
[4520.56 → 4521.60] you feel it.
[4521.76 → 4521.92] Yeah.
[4522.16 → 4522.34] Yeah.
[4523.30 → 4525.22] And I think that's pretty much
[4525.22 → 4526.32] it for the show for today.
[4526.40 → 4527.24] I do need to go through
[4527.24 → 4528.94] some super chats for you all.
[4529.26 → 4530.16] Thanks, Parker Reed.
[4530.30 → 4531.76] Thanks, It's Red Shadow.
[4532.90 → 4533.68] Only going to be able
[4533.68 → 4534.24] to go a few,
[4534.40 → 4535.26] go through a few of them.
[4535.44 → 4535.96] Thanks, Joe.
[4536.04 → 4536.84] We're working real hard
[4536.84 → 4538.48] on Verified Actual Gamer Program.
[4538.48 → 4540.46] Papa says,
[4540.52 → 4540.88] what happened
[4540.88 → 4542.06] to the prototype screwdriver?
[4542.88 → 4543.44] I don't know.
[4544.62 → 4545.46] Scott says,
[4545.56 → 4546.52] is there a chance
[4546.52 → 4547.30] you can have
[4547.30 → 4548.54] previous gamer gauntlets
[4548.54 → 4549.72] on their own website
[4549.72 → 4550.40] for people who just
[4550.40 → 4551.58] want to try and complete it?
[4552.14 → 4554.08] We are leaving everything
[4554.08 → 4555.70] offline as often
[4555.70 → 4556.56] as we can,
[4556.82 → 4557.64] just so that
[4557.64 → 4558.84] people don't
[4558.84 → 4559.82] poke around at it.
[4560.46 → 4562.50] So not at this time,
[4562.56 → 4563.24] but there's nothing
[4563.24 → 4564.32] to say that we couldn't
[4564.32 → 4565.22] resurrect them all
[4565.22 → 4565.64] at the end
[4565.64 → 4566.30] or something like that.
[4566.38 → 4567.14] Is that doable, Luke?
[4567.14 → 4569.36] Yeah, I don't know.
[4569.52 → 4570.02] I don't know.
[4570.30 → 4570.78] Super Luigi.
[4570.78 → 4571.52] People just want
[4571.52 → 4572.04] to do the quizzes.
[4572.82 → 4573.58] People just want
[4573.58 → 4574.14] to do the quizzes.
[4575.24 → 4575.98] We could probably
[4575.98 → 4576.92] find a solution for that.
[4578.12 → 4579.06] Super Luigi says,
[4579.14 → 4579.60] got my stuff
[4579.60 → 4580.46] from LTT Store today.
[4580.54 → 4581.10] Thanks, love it.
[4581.14 → 4581.88] Keep up the great work.
[4582.40 → 4583.14] Michael B says,
[4583.24 → 4583.74] please shill
[4583.74 → 4584.64] for Louis Grossman's
[4584.64 → 4585.12] GoFundMe
[4585.12 → 4588.26] for the Right to Repair Law
[4588.26 → 4589.46] Direct Ballot Initiative.
[4590.10 → 4591.64] Yes, consider this shilling,
[4591.78 → 4592.62] but we also have a video
[4592.62 → 4593.90] coming on LTT.
[4594.08 → 4594.56] We didn't get it
[4594.56 → 4595.32] filmed this week,
[4595.32 → 4596.44] unfortunately.
[4597.24 → 4598.86] The writer who worked on it,
[4599.04 → 4600.04] I think by the time
[4600.04 → 4600.48] it comes out,
[4600.54 → 4601.38] they'll still be on probation,
[4601.58 → 4602.28] so I won't be calling
[4602.28 → 4603.42] them out specifically.
[4603.62 → 4604.12] So you'll never know
[4604.12 → 4604.62] who it was,
[4604.96 → 4605.64] but they brought it
[4605.64 → 4606.40] to my office
[4606.40 → 4607.36] and I basically said,
[4607.48 → 4608.32] this needs to go back
[4608.32 → 4608.80] to the kitchen
[4608.80 → 4609.72] and we shot something else
[4609.72 → 4610.02] instead.
[4610.48 → 4611.90] So we are doing a video,
[4612.02 → 4612.74] it just didn't get done
[4612.74 → 4613.14] on time.
[4613.20 → 4613.62] I'm sorry.
[4614.30 → 4614.96] Phantom says,
[4615.04 → 4615.82] New Zealand has everything
[4615.82 → 4616.76] in stock at MSRP.
[4617.04 → 4618.16] Well, enjoy that,
[4618.28 → 4619.38] but remember your MSRP
[4619.38 → 4620.30] is like crap
[4620.30 → 4621.44] compared to everywhere else,
[4621.44 → 4624.84] so sorry, New Zealand.
[4626.28 → 4626.92] Parker Thomas,
[4626.98 → 4627.74] look, you started it.
[4627.98 → 4628.80] Parker Thomas says,
[4628.88 → 4629.28] hey Linus,
[4629.30 → 4629.98] I didn't get a chance
[4629.98 → 4630.74] to engage last week
[4630.74 → 4631.38] about right to repair,
[4631.46 → 4633.04] but I work for Redacted,
[4633.28 → 4634.68] a Japanese equipment company
[4634.68 → 4635.70] and the right to repair issue
[4635.70 → 4636.60] is just as big there
[4636.60 → 4637.58] as it is in electronics.
[4637.66 → 4638.26] I believe you.
[4638.54 → 4639.44] Good luck, Lewis.
[4640.88 → 4641.52] Dub craft says,
[4641.56 → 4642.08] do you have any tips
[4642.08 → 4642.94] for getting a GPU?
[4643.46 → 4645.06] Well, you can pay way too much
[4645.06 → 4646.56] or you can wait
[4646.56 → 4647.72] for a verified actual
[4647.72 → 4649.18] gamer program drop.
[4649.18 → 4650.74] Unfortunately,
[4650.94 → 4652.10] I don't really have any tips
[4652.10 → 4652.78] other than that.
[4653.28 → 4653.92] Vishnu says,
[4653.98 → 4654.42] I've been watching
[4654.42 → 4654.82] the WAN show
[4654.82 → 4655.84] for nearly two years.
[4655.96 → 4656.66] Watched most of the
[4656.66 → 4657.46] back catalogue too
[4657.46 → 4658.76] simply because it's good fun.
[4658.86 → 4659.62] Luke is the best.
[4660.20 → 4660.90] There you go, Luke.
[4661.08 → 4661.48] Hey.
[4661.80 → 4663.98] Tell us more about
[4663.98 → 4665.16] your motorcycle, Linus.
[4666.32 → 4666.92] You know,
[4667.02 → 4667.88] I was going to upgrade.
[4668.84 → 4669.66] I actually,
[4669.78 → 4670.78] did I tell you about this,
[4670.88 → 4671.00] Luke,
[4671.04 → 4672.10] how I went to the dealership?
[4673.94 → 4674.30] No.
[4674.80 → 4675.54] Oh, wow.
[4675.68 → 4676.14] Okay, well,
[4676.16 → 4676.72] I guess we're getting
[4676.72 → 4678.22] into Linus story time.
[4678.22 → 4680.58] I was so sure
[4680.58 → 4681.82] that I was going to be
[4681.82 → 4682.66] buying myself
[4682.66 → 4685.34] a Zero SRS motorbike.
[4685.50 → 4686.48] So this is their
[4686.48 → 4688.10] top of the line,
[4688.24 → 4689.02] like sporty,
[4689.66 → 4691.34] freaking zero to 60
[4691.34 → 4693.32] in three and a half seconds
[4693.32 → 4693.86] or whatever.
[4694.66 → 4695.66] Crazy thing.
[4696.24 → 4697.84] What's the zero to 60
[4697.84 → 4698.80] on this stupid thing?
[4699.04 → 4699.78] So you want to be
[4699.78 → 4700.44] the cool dad?
[4700.98 → 4701.70] Control F60.
[4701.78 → 4701.92] Hey,
[4702.04 → 4703.46] I am the cool dad
[4703.46 → 4704.06] at this point
[4704.06 → 4706.10] because we actually
[4706.10 → 4707.90] geared up my son
[4707.90 → 4708.84] and he's ready
[4708.84 → 4709.48] to start riding
[4709.48 → 4710.28] on the bike with me.
[4710.76 → 4711.70] That's pretty cool.
[4711.82 → 4713.14] That's actually pretty sweet.
[4713.28 → 4713.76] I'm stoked.
[4714.50 → 4714.90] Anyway,
[4715.08 → 4715.28] yeah,
[4715.36 → 4716.48] so I was all set
[4716.48 → 4718.04] to buy a Zero SRS.
[4718.28 → 4719.32] They had one in stock
[4719.32 → 4720.50] that was the colour I liked.
[4720.56 → 4721.54] It had the options I wanted.
[4721.78 → 4723.12] I even took out the money.
[4723.40 → 4723.64] Like,
[4723.72 → 4725.32] I had cash money
[4725.32 → 4726.22] in my pocket.
[4726.48 → 4727.18] I was going to buy
[4727.18 → 4728.84] this thing sight unseen.
[4729.28 → 4730.18] So I get there.
[4730.30 → 4731.28] I basically sit on it.
[4731.30 → 4731.50] I'm like,
[4731.54 → 4731.70] yep,
[4731.72 → 4732.48] seems pretty comfortable.
[4732.80 → 4733.12] All right,
[4733.32 → 4733.90] I'm going to do it.
[4734.02 → 4735.04] And Yvonne's like,
[4735.50 → 4737.00] are you serious right now?
[4737.12 → 4737.32] Like,
[4737.40 → 4738.02] you're not going to,
[4738.10 → 4739.20] you have to test drive it.
[4739.22 → 4739.42] I'm like,
[4739.46 → 4739.56] no,
[4739.58 → 4739.98] it's comfortable.
[4740.36 → 4740.82] She's like,
[4741.30 → 4741.94] test drive it.
[4742.10 → 4742.30] I'm like,
[4742.36 → 4742.58] okay,
[4742.66 → 4742.84] fine,
[4742.88 → 4743.02] fine,
[4743.08 → 4743.22] fine.
[4743.46 → 4744.10] So the reason
[4744.10 → 4744.96] I didn't want to do it,
[4745.26 → 4746.00] that's good advice.
[4746.20 → 4747.46] The reason I didn't want to do it
[4747.46 → 4748.30] was because I was in the mood
[4748.30 → 4749.26] to do something impulsive.
[4749.40 → 4750.96] My bike is from 2003.
[4751.38 → 4752.46] I kind of was like,
[4752.52 → 4752.80] you know what?
[4752.80 → 4753.46] I'm treating myself
[4753.46 → 4754.20] to a motorcycle.
[4754.36 → 4755.16] I'm just going to do it.
[4755.80 → 4757.64] So I had basically made the decision.
[4758.48 → 4758.88] Anyway,
[4759.12 → 4759.94] it's good advice.
[4760.06 → 4760.94] You should always do that
[4760.94 → 4762.86] because what happened to me
[4762.86 → 4764.16] might happen to you.
[4764.38 → 4764.70] Now,
[4764.74 → 4766.04] I hadn't wanted to bug them about it
[4766.04 → 4766.72] because normally,
[4766.88 → 4767.92] especially in COVID times,
[4767.98 → 4770.12] you're expected to book a test drive
[4770.12 → 4771.64] like a few days in advance
[4771.64 → 4773.00] so they can get everything ready
[4773.00 → 4774.92] and book a slot for you
[4774.92 → 4775.46] and all that.
[4776.28 → 4777.32] Good luck for me.
[4777.64 → 4779.70] The tech in the showroom
[4779.70 → 4781.70] happens to be an LTT fan.
[4782.34 → 4782.84] So he was like,
[4783.46 → 4784.04] so she was like,
[4784.04 → 4784.26] look,
[4784.34 → 4785.52] can you test drive it?
[4785.64 → 4785.94] And I'm like,
[4785.96 → 4786.08] oh,
[4786.10 → 4787.10] I don't want to like bug them.
[4787.30 → 4787.68] And he's like,
[4787.82 → 4788.00] yeah,
[4788.00 → 4788.20] sure,
[4788.26 → 4788.64] no problem.
[4788.70 → 4790.00] I'll get it ready for you right now.
[4790.02 → 4790.38] And I'm like,
[4790.64 → 4791.08] heck yeah,
[4791.16 → 4791.60] thank you.
[4792.12 → 4793.52] And it saved me
[4793.52 → 4796.02] $25,000 Canadian dollars
[4796.02 → 4797.76] because I got on it
[4797.76 → 4801.00] and absolutely hated it.
[4801.92 → 4802.32] Why?
[4803.32 → 4804.84] So here's the thing.
[4806.06 → 4807.28] I drive an electric car,
[4807.54 → 4807.80] right?
[4809.48 → 4811.56] And I miss my manual transmission
[4811.56 → 4812.64] once in a while,
[4812.64 → 4814.44] but I,
[4814.80 → 4815.88] you know,
[4815.96 → 4817.42] I never thought of myself
[4817.42 → 4817.98] as like,
[4818.06 → 4818.56] you know,
[4818.68 → 4821.52] I need that,
[4821.56 → 4822.74] that engine noise.
[4822.74 → 4823.96] I need that rumble
[4823.96 → 4825.12] kind of person
[4825.12 → 4826.96] because I've driven
[4826.96 → 4828.54] high performance vehicles
[4828.54 → 4829.70] like I,
[4829.96 → 4830.80] Lamborghini,
[4830.92 → 4831.82] whatever the crap
[4831.82 → 4832.36] and Ferrari,
[4832.52 → 4833.80] whatever on a track.
[4833.80 → 4834.96] I,
[4835.22 → 4835.40] you know,
[4835.46 → 4836.88] whenever people buy new cars
[4836.88 → 4837.94] at Linus Media Group,
[4838.06 → 4838.30] it's,
[4838.56 → 4839.12] it's,
[4839.22 → 4840.94] it's kind of funny.
[4841.12 → 4841.92] A lot of them
[4841.92 → 4843.18] want me to drive it
[4843.18 → 4844.62] like just to like to try it out.
[4844.62 → 4845.16] And I,
[4845.24 → 4845.84] I like it.
[4845.90 → 4847.06] I like just trying things out.
[4847.12 → 4847.44] So I'm like,
[4847.50 → 4847.62] yeah,
[4847.68 → 4848.06] heck yeah.
[4848.30 → 4849.24] So like I've driven
[4849.24 → 4850.62] Brandon's Model X.
[4851.30 → 4852.10] I've driven,
[4852.10 → 4853.90] oh man,
[4854.02 → 4856.06] I've driven Alex's Fiesta.
[4857.06 → 4858.58] I've driven like,
[4858.98 → 4860.62] I've driven a handful
[4860.62 → 4861.16] of like,
[4861.20 → 4861.38] you know,
[4861.38 → 4861.86] cool,
[4862.10 → 4862.80] fun cars.
[4864.70 → 4865.36] I've driven,
[4865.36 → 4865.48] oh,
[4865.52 → 4866.14] I drove my,
[4866.22 → 4867.68] my in-laws Model Y
[4867.68 → 4868.36] extensively
[4868.36 → 4869.40] because I borrowed it
[4869.40 → 4870.56] after I bought it for them.
[4871.18 → 4871.80] And I just,
[4871.94 → 4872.60] I've never cared.
[4872.84 → 4873.08] It just,
[4873.22 → 4873.50] it's like,
[4873.54 → 4873.66] yeah,
[4873.72 → 4874.20] I don't know.
[4874.22 → 4874.82] It's got four wheels.
[4874.88 → 4875.16] Who cares?
[4875.62 → 4875.94] Um,
[4876.72 → 4877.78] but here's the thing.
[4879.06 → 4880.42] I don't drive a car for fun.
[4880.62 → 4881.82] I drive a car to get
[4881.82 → 4882.76] from point A to point B.
[4883.80 → 4885.06] I drive my motorcycle
[4885.06 → 4886.32] for fun.
[4887.10 → 4888.84] So I had this,
[4888.98 → 4890.26] oh,
[4890.92 → 4891.58] moment
[4891.58 → 4893.66] when I got on an electric bike
[4893.66 → 4894.82] that dramatically
[4894.82 → 4896.66] outperforms my mere,
[4897.00 → 4897.76] you know,
[4898.32 → 4899.92] 650 cc
[4899.92 → 4900.90] sport bike.
[4901.38 → 4901.82] Um,
[4901.88 → 4902.08] just,
[4902.18 → 4902.56] just like,
[4902.64 → 4902.86] it's,
[4902.90 → 4904.42] it's a completely different
[4904.42 → 4905.62] class of vehicle.
[4906.30 → 4907.76] But in spite of
[4907.76 → 4909.50] how fast I was going,
[4909.62 → 4910.30] it just
[4910.30 → 4911.58] wasn't
[4911.58 → 4912.76] fun
[4912.76 → 4913.86] for me.
[4913.94 → 4915.66] So I finally understand
[4915.66 → 4916.58] the car people
[4916.58 → 4918.10] who drive cars for fun.
[4918.92 → 4920.24] This is why
[4920.24 → 4921.68] they don't care
[4921.68 → 4922.50] about
[4922.50 → 4923.56] Model 3
[4923.56 → 4924.14] or
[4924.14 → 4925.04] Model Y
[4925.04 → 4925.44] or
[4925.44 → 4926.46] anything
[4926.46 → 4927.74] with a battery in it
[4927.74 → 4928.92] that doesn't make the noise.
[4929.16 → 4929.50] And
[4929.50 → 4929.96] I,
[4929.96 → 4930.56] I don't know.
[4931.04 → 4931.52] I,
[4931.76 → 4933.02] I want the vroom, vroom,
[4933.16 → 4933.38] man.
[4933.50 → 4933.88] Come on.
[4933.88 → 4934.92] I was a bit of a hater
[4934.92 → 4936.14] about that viewpoint
[4936.14 → 4936.64] before.
[4936.76 → 4937.22] I was like,
[4937.32 → 4937.54] whatever,
[4937.66 → 4938.04] who cares?
[4938.74 → 4939.08] Um,
[4939.12 → 4939.86] but part of that
[4939.86 → 4940.14] whatever,
[4940.26 → 4940.66] who cares
[4940.66 → 4941.14] was because
[4941.14 → 4941.66] I really
[4941.66 → 4942.62] just am
[4942.62 → 4942.88] whatever,
[4943.04 → 4943.38] who cares
[4943.38 → 4943.82] when it comes
[4943.82 → 4944.12] to something
[4944.12 → 4944.86] that's on four wheels.
[4945.44 → 4945.64] Um,
[4945.64 → 4946.36] so what I decided
[4946.36 → 4947.30] to do was
[4947.30 → 4948.56] we took
[4948.56 → 4949.42] some of that money
[4949.42 → 4950.84] and I
[4950.84 → 4951.72] fixed up the bike.
[4951.78 → 4952.68] I got a new chain.
[4952.96 → 4953.36] Um,
[4953.92 → 4955.58] I got the valves checked.
[4955.66 → 4956.66] It was kind of overdue.
[4956.86 → 4957.00] I,
[4957.12 → 4957.34] like,
[4958.12 → 4958.84] basically did,
[4958.88 → 4959.10] like,
[4959.12 → 4960.08] a complete service
[4960.08 → 4960.48] on the bike.
[4960.54 → 4961.18] Got new tires.
[4961.60 → 4961.90] Um,
[4961.90 → 4963.16] got gear for the boy.
[4963.36 → 4964.26] So I did end up
[4964.26 → 4965.44] spending a couple G's,
[4965.54 → 4966.18] but it certainly
[4966.18 → 4967.20] was a lot less
[4967.20 → 4968.12] than that zero.
[4968.78 → 4969.74] And honestly,
[4969.74 → 4971.36] I am way happier
[4971.36 → 4973.28] just having my bike back
[4973.28 → 4974.16] and running
[4974.16 → 4975.26] like the day I got it,
[4975.36 → 4977.26] even though it's a 2003
[4977.26 → 4978.20] and,
[4978.32 → 4978.62] uh,
[4979.18 → 4980.64] I don't regret it at all.
[4981.24 → 4982.10] Do you know that I,
[4982.10 → 4982.50] I've,
[4982.58 → 4983.58] I rode on a moped
[4983.58 → 4984.30] with Dennis
[4984.30 → 4985.56] when Dennis was driving,
[4985.66 → 4986.06] not me.
[4986.06 → 4986.92] I believe you.
[4986.92 → 4987.58] And I have done
[4987.58 → 4988.22] the same thing
[4988.22 → 4989.88] and I don't envy you.
[4992.00 → 4992.94] That's not funny.
[4993.30 → 4993.70] Imagine,
[4993.90 → 4994.90] imagine that,
[4995.00 → 4995.96] but him trying to turn
[4995.96 → 4996.98] with me on the back.
[4997.18 → 4998.74] So the time I did it,
[4998.86 → 4999.80] me and Colton
[4999.80 → 5000.42] were on the back.
[5003.10 → 5004.50] I think between the two of us,
[5004.56 → 5005.64] we weigh about as much as you.
[5006.34 → 5006.46] I,
[5006.58 → 5006.76] man,
[5006.80 → 5008.00] I miss Taiwan so much.
[5008.14 → 5008.62] Me too.
[5008.70 → 5009.72] I can't wait to go back.
[5010.28 → 5010.50] Oh.
[5011.56 → 5012.38] Kenneth asks,
[5012.38 → 5013.42] will you be using
[5013.42 → 5014.58] the gold controller
[5014.58 → 5015.40] during the verified
[5015.40 → 5016.60] actual gamer challenge?
[5016.94 → 5017.78] Probably not.
[5017.88 → 5019.36] It's worth so much.
[5019.44 → 5019.84] I'm like,
[5020.30 → 5021.30] afraid to take it
[5021.30 → 5021.96] out of the vault,
[5022.06 → 5022.30] man.
[5022.46 → 5022.66] I,
[5022.80 → 5023.26] I don't know.
[5023.32 → 5024.12] I want someone to just
[5024.12 → 5025.00] buy it from me,
[5025.06 → 5026.20] but I keep kind of
[5026.20 → 5027.40] mentioning it in videos
[5027.40 → 5028.12] and people keep
[5028.12 → 5030.08] not offering to buy it.
[5030.66 → 5032.12] Maybe I underestimated
[5032.12 → 5033.64] like how many oil princes
[5033.64 → 5034.36] are out there
[5034.36 → 5035.52] who just want to own
[5035.52 → 5037.20] a golden Xbox controller.
[5038.72 → 5039.12] Um,
[5039.18 → 5039.40] okay.
[5039.40 → 5040.40] What else we got here?
[5040.64 → 5041.50] Minor says,
[5041.50 → 5042.38] Minor Illusion,
[5042.70 → 5043.14] LAO,
[5043.36 → 5044.02] LMAO.
[5044.36 → 5045.04] I'm in lol.
[5045.18 → 5046.10] Like you guys would even notice
[5046.10 → 5046.72] I'd be there.
[5046.84 → 5047.48] I see you.
[5047.56 → 5049.18] I've been a gamer for 40 years.
[5049.80 → 5050.42] All right.
[5050.46 → 5050.72] Cool.
[5051.20 → 5051.36] Uh,
[5051.36 → 5051.92] cage says,
[5052.00 → 5053.06] I just want to thank LMG.
[5053.14 → 5053.74] Your videos helped me
[5053.74 → 5054.42] build a new PC
[5054.42 → 5055.62] after my first one died.
[5055.84 → 5056.90] I hope to one day
[5056.90 → 5058.16] rebuild it in my dad's honour,
[5058.28 → 5059.20] even though he never got
[5059.20 → 5059.94] into gaming beyond
[5059.94 → 5060.62] to be jewelled.
[5060.78 → 5061.40] He understood it was
[5061.40 → 5062.26] my passion and supported
[5062.26 → 5062.96] me a hundred percent.
[5063.10 → 5063.34] Sweet.
[5063.56 → 5064.16] Thanks cage.
[5065.84 → 5066.28] Um,
[5067.00 → 5067.52] all right.
[5067.60 → 5068.82] John Allen short says,
[5068.82 → 5069.12] please,
[5069.24 → 5070.80] you can explain how the link,
[5070.80 → 5073.52] how the verified actual gamers link
[5073.52 → 5074.86] worked in the most recent video.
[5075.04 → 5075.52] Oh,
[5075.62 → 5076.24] it was,
[5076.28 → 5076.70] um,
[5076.94 → 5078.48] 12 Zen three,
[5078.74 → 5079.12] everything.
[5079.46 → 5080.96] So in the video,
[5080.96 → 5082.74] I like put up my fingers
[5082.74 → 5084.50] when I was giving the information
[5084.50 → 5086.12] for what was going to be
[5086.12 → 5087.06] in the link.
[5087.84 → 5088.36] Uh,
[5088.36 → 5088.96] Phantom says,
[5089.04 → 5090.26] I'm using Starlink to watch this
[5090.26 → 5091.62] on my yacht in the Bahamas.
[5093.46 → 5096.52] Casual ultimate end game flex much.
[5096.68 → 5098.26] Buy the Xbox controller.
[5098.26 → 5099.54] Yeah.
[5099.76 → 5099.96] Yeah.
[5100.08 → 5100.42] Phantom,
[5100.64 → 5102.68] you want a golden Xbox controller
[5102.68 → 5103.72] for your yacht?
[5104.72 → 5104.92] Uh,
[5104.98 → 5105.70] Nathan says,
[5105.98 → 5106.44] Steve.
[5106.70 → 5106.98] All right.
[5107.00 → 5107.24] Thanks,
[5107.32 → 5107.54] Nathan.
[5107.62 → 5109.64] It costs you $20 to send the message
[5109.64 → 5111.22] Steve to my chat.
[5111.22 → 5111.66] Uh,
[5112.34 → 5113.14] Phantom says,
[5113.24 → 5115.72] I plugged Starlink into my private jet
[5115.72 → 5117.30] and now 12 hour flights
[5117.30 → 5118.24] feel like five hours.
[5118.42 → 5120.20] You are so full of sh**
[5120.20 → 5121.78] because that's not how it works.
[5121.80 → 5122.54] Not how it works.
[5123.70 → 5124.62] Gabriel asks,
[5124.74 → 5125.44] are you ever going to do
[5125.44 → 5126.48] when hoodies again?
[5126.98 → 5127.32] Ah,
[5127.54 → 5127.96] Gabriel,
[5128.26 → 5129.90] we have an office tour coming,
[5130.08 → 5130.58] which is,
[5131.02 → 5132.50] it took so long to film Luke.
[5132.62 → 5134.50] Our office is literally double the size
[5134.50 → 5135.74] that it was when we first moved in there.
[5135.80 → 5137.00] I didn't really realize.
[5137.32 → 5137.94] Pretty big.
[5138.00 → 5138.52] It is literally.
[5138.52 → 5139.20] It is also like,
[5139.72 → 5141.22] is extremely different.
[5141.64 → 5142.04] And,
[5142.38 → 5145.00] I tease the WAN show hoodie V2 in it.
[5145.12 → 5145.36] Oh,
[5145.58 → 5146.28] don't miss the video.
[5147.36 → 5147.72] Um,
[5148.08 → 5148.74] Gareth says,
[5148.88 → 5150.76] is your verified gaming thing
[5150.76 → 5152.14] happening in Australia too?
[5152.20 → 5152.34] Yeah,
[5152.34 → 5153.72] it's totally available in Australia.
[5153.72 → 5155.48] You just have to watch the video,
[5155.66 → 5156.00] uh,
[5156.00 → 5156.76] same as everyone else
[5156.76 → 5157.42] when it launches.
[5157.86 → 5158.98] Not the local one.
[5160.48 → 5160.68] Yeah,
[5160.72 → 5160.84] no,
[5160.90 → 5161.74] not the local one.
[5161.78 → 5163.48] I'm not flying to Australia.
[5163.76 → 5165.04] As safe as it might be there,
[5165.40 → 5166.14] says Gabe Newell.
[5166.26 → 5166.40] Although,
[5166.44 → 5167.18] I think he's in New Zealand.
[5168.12 → 5168.62] All right,
[5168.78 → 5169.80] that is it
[5169.80 → 5171.26] for the WAN show for today.
[5171.44 → 5172.06] Thank you guys
[5172.06 → 5173.44] so much for tuning in.
[5173.54 → 5173.68] Sorry,
[5173.68 → 5174.08] I was late.
[5174.82 → 5175.02] Uh,
[5175.02 → 5176.06] we'll see you again next week.
[5176.36 → 5177.42] Same bad time,
[5177.74 → 5178.42] same bad channel.
[5178.50 → 5179.06] In my defence,
[5179.12 → 5179.68] I was late
[5179.68 → 5181.16] because water was going to spill
[5181.16 → 5182.36] onto an RTX 3090
[5182.36 → 5184.12] and we really had to finish the video
[5184.12 → 5185.86] or we would risk the 3090.
[5185.96 → 5186.98] I don't think anyone wants us
[5186.98 → 5187.82] to risk a 3090,
[5187.88 → 5188.10] okay?
[5189.02 → 5189.38] Agreed.
[5189.56 → 5189.96] Okay.
[5190.14 → 5190.98] Don't miss that video.
[5191.12 → 5192.72] It involves putting a car radiator,
[5192.90 → 5193.06] like,
[5193.16 → 5194.90] bolted to the top of a computer case
[5194.90 → 5195.28] and putting,
[5195.28 → 5195.58] like,
[5195.66 → 5197.22] nine fans on it and stuff.
[5197.82 → 5198.00] Hey,
[5198.00 → 5198.90] we've kind of done that.
[5199.10 → 5199.42] Yeah,
[5199.54 → 5200.16] this is bigger.
[5200.16 → 5201.94] really,
[5201.94 → 5202.82] really poorly.
[5203.34 → 5203.78] Okay.
[5203.78 → 5204.62] We did it worse.
[5205.62 → 5206.88] You did it worse?
[5208.12 → 5209.50] Do you remember mine?
[5209.94 → 5210.44] I do
[5210.44 → 5211.34] and we did it worse.
[5211.94 → 5212.30] Oh,
[5212.42 → 5212.68] okay.
[5212.80 → 5213.00] Wow,
[5213.04 → 5213.54] that's actually,
[5213.70 → 5215.04] I'm genuinely impressed.
[5215.20 → 5215.86] I don't know how
[5215.86 → 5216.84] that's possible.
[5217.12 → 5217.80] Don't miss it.
[5218.36 → 5219.66] It's like actual water
[5219.66 → 5220.52] dripping down
[5220.52 → 5222.12] around an RTX 3090.
[5222.30 → 5222.78] It's terrible.
[5223.42 → 5223.64] Oh.
[5226.04 → 5227.08] Anthony Goodly,
[5227.38 → 5228.16] good comment.
[5228.36 → 5229.46] Like they would sell
[5229.46 → 5231.04] the diamond play button PC.
[5231.60 → 5232.74] That's too personal.
[5232.98 → 5233.24] Yes,
[5233.30 → 5235.12] we would not sell
[5235.12 → 5236.94] the diamond play button PC.
[5237.24 → 5237.94] That is,
[5238.12 → 5239.00] that's my PC,
[5239.16 → 5239.32] yo.
[5239.78 → 5240.74] Everything has a price.
[5243.08 → 5243.56] Okay,
[5243.80 → 5244.32] try me.
[5244.98 → 5246.14] Make a legit offer
[5246.14 → 5247.02] and then
[5247.02 → 5247.74] know
[5247.74 → 5249.22] that if I accept it,
[5249.34 → 5250.12] you have to actually
[5250.12 → 5250.76] give me the money.
[5250.86 → 5251.84] Why would I buy it?
[5251.94 → 5253.44] I don't want to buy it.
[5253.52 → 5254.12] I don't know.
[5254.52 → 5255.06] I don't know.
[5255.18 → 5255.94] Make me an offer.
[5256.56 → 5256.70] I,
[5256.78 → 5256.88] I,
[5256.88 → 5258.08] I didn't say
[5258.08 → 5259.36] I was willing
[5259.36 → 5260.38] to buy anything.
[5260.38 → 5260.80] I said,
[5260.80 → 5262.20] anything has a price.
[5262.30 → 5262.84] I see.
[5262.98 → 5263.96] I see what you're saying.
[5264.08 → 5264.30] Yeah.
[5264.54 → 5265.50] Just cheap,
[5265.70 → 5266.40] cheap words.
[5266.94 → 5267.14] Well,
[5267.20 → 5267.50] yeah,
[5267.62 → 5269.80] they are.
