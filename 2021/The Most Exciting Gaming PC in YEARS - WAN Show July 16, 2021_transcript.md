[0.00 --> 10.92]  Welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you today because
[10.92 --> 19.04]  boy is it ever easier to have a fun and exciting WAN show when we've got news like this week the
[19.04 --> 27.42]  valve the valve steam deck is the hot right now and everyone's talking about it and why not because
[27.42 --> 34.52]  this thing is flippin excited so we're gonna dig into that we're also gonna be talking about TSMC
[34.52 --> 41.88]  exploring on chip water cooling this is something enthusiasts have explored at times in the past but
[41.88 --> 48.98]  it's certainly to my knowledge never been looked at by someone as important and as actually capable
[48.98 --> 57.30]  of pulling it off as TSMC what else we got uh Alder Lake is hopefully gonna be not terrible
[57.30 --> 65.56]  which would be absolutely fantastic um and Microsoft announces Windows 365 just in case you want
[65.56 --> 70.38]  another subscription service there you go problem solved did they really I actually didn't see this
[70.38 --> 75.74]  yes it's probably not exactly what you think so stay tuned and we'll talk more about it later okay then
[75.74 --> 85.16]  it's like remote testing stuff it's actually like maybe kind of cool all right all right
[85.16 --> 104.86]  and the show is brought to you today by pulseway ridge wallet and oops I clicked the oh yeah
[104.86 --> 110.42]  squarespace yes that's definitely right okay cool so why don't we jump right into our headline topic
[110.42 --> 117.98]  the valve steam deck and I want to start with what is going to be my harshest criticism of this new
[117.98 --> 123.36]  hardware endeavor from valve yes okay all right this is my hot take this is the worst thing about it
[123.36 --> 132.46]  the name sucks it's terrible it's terrible it's terrible the stream deck has existed for years yes
[132.46 --> 141.14]  for years the elgato stream deck which is even a gaming device for years it's existed it's been in the
[141.14 --> 148.70]  market and it's the only thing that kind of sounds like that like is external to the computer and
[148.70 --> 152.02]  technically has screens on it and is flat and is black
[152.02 --> 163.46]  why just like even more annoying why deck yeah that's who like what I don't know I understand
[163.46 --> 172.06]  the stream deck that actually does make sense to me steam deck no steam boy I'd have been like lol
[172.06 --> 178.84]  okay and nintendo's coming for you you know nintendo would be coming for him yeah steam steam okay so here
[178.84 --> 183.22]  fine it's not helpful to criticize something unless you come up with something better so Luke we got to
[183.22 --> 190.16]  work on this then so Steve there's been a pretty good one there's been two there's one that I like more
[190.16 --> 195.90]  that to get the community ones first before we try to come up with things hit me um there's there's one in
[195.90 --> 204.00]  the doc that calls it I mean it's called the Gabe boy there's the Gabe boy Gabe boy advanced and Gabe boy
[204.00 --> 211.16]  advanced sp that one's funny I believe that was that by Anthony Anthony contributed a very large
[211.16 --> 215.64]  amount of topics this week so we only really have a doc because of Anthony so thank you Anthony
[215.64 --> 222.18]  very funny but the other I agree that wasn't sarcastic that was actually I know it could probably
[222.18 --> 226.56]  sound that way but it wasn't we would have like two topics if it wasn't for Anthony he actually
[226.56 --> 232.20]  completely bailed us out thank you very much um but the the other community one which I do think is
[232.20 --> 240.54]  is better is Gabe gear no no you can't have Gabe's name in the name of the thing like I have no problem
[240.54 --> 250.38]  with them calling it steam something you know steam pad or steam I I don't know steam I mean like
[250.38 --> 255.12]  you know what's something kind of like deck is too close to stream deck that's all that's like that's
[255.12 --> 260.30]  the just that's just the main problem and it's not an unheard of device a lot of people know the the
[260.30 --> 265.76]  stream deck so it's like just annoying honestly when I first read the name I thought it was called
[265.76 --> 270.94]  stream deck and I thought they just straight up completely ripped off the name from Elgato because
[270.94 --> 278.54]  it's not like valve doesn't have a streaming service well that was my whole thought was like yeah okay so
[278.54 --> 283.82]  this is to to remotely play games from your desktop using valve right like steam and home streaming which I
[283.82 --> 288.64]  don't know what they call it any remote play is it no no remote play is when you're playing a local
[288.64 --> 291.96]  multiplayer game with someone remotely sorry I can't keep track of all the different things they
[291.96 --> 298.08]  call stuff the point is so should we really call it steam deck I have I'm frustrated the good news
[298.08 --> 305.58]  is that everything else about this thing looks absolutely freaking awesome let's uh let's haul up
[305.58 --> 310.30]  the product page here I mean I even typed stream deck while I was trying to search for it
[310.30 --> 315.68]  bloody hell okay it's yeah yeah your mind immediately goes to stream deck it's a problem
[315.68 --> 321.98]  oh uh that's uh not the screen capture that I wanted what happened to my oh no here we go that's
[321.98 --> 329.42]  better steam deck here it is ladies and gentlemen so one thing before you get too far into it yes um
[329.42 --> 335.70]  can they see the layout of it on your screen right now uh the layout of the of the of like the the pc
[335.70 --> 342.56]  of the steam deck yeah ignore the pricing guys I'm stuck on the Canadian site and I can't immediately
[342.56 --> 348.36]  figure out how to change it so this is this is Canadian pricing uh so whatever
[348.36 --> 357.16]  so my my favorite thing if they can see it yeah is that it more closely resembles a wii u game pad
[357.16 --> 363.92]  and most other things I have seen so far and the wii u game pad was actually a delight to use it was
[363.92 --> 369.16]  fantastic I actually preferred it over the standard controllers it was really nice and one of the things
[369.16 --> 374.12]  with that is that the thumbsticks are at the top okay you're getting into nitty-gritty details here
[374.12 --> 381.04]  but we got to give people the general lowdown okay Luke we got to give them the lowdown so here's the
[381.04 --> 388.12]  basic specs it's got a seven inch display it's touchscreen it's 1280 by 800 so that's a 16 by 10
[388.12 --> 393.66]  aspect ratio 400 nits typical brightness it's got an ambient light sensor so that's going to help you
[393.66 --> 400.24]  conserve battery if you're in a dim area or whatever the case may be it's got a zen 2 apu four cores eight
[400.24 --> 406.70]  threads running it anywhere from well up to 3.5 gigahertz boost and up to 15 watts tdp it's got an
[406.70 --> 414.52]  eight it's got eight rdna2 cus that run it up to 1.6 gigahertz so this thing is actually going to be
[414.52 --> 422.66]  capable of running triple a games now not triple a games at 4k resolution in dock mode or anything
[422.66 --> 428.76]  stupid like that it's still you know of this earth it's not like they went to the future and
[428.76 --> 435.82]  brought back technology with them but it is going to have some serious grunt considering its size it
[435.82 --> 447.66]  weighs 1.47 pounds so that's uh just under 700 grams 669 grams um which is pretty beefy and maybe this
[447.66 --> 453.28]  some engineer must have must have pulled off a couple grams there to make that work that i swear
[453.28 --> 460.98]  that i i wouldn't put it past them but this is i think this is the first time that this is where we
[460.98 --> 464.52]  can get into a little bit of a deeper dive conversation one of the things that you
[464.52 --> 473.06]  immediately said was wow this reminds me of the wii u gamepad controller unfortunately this thing weighs
[473.06 --> 479.96]  67 percent more than a nintendo switch plus joy cons and considering that the wii u controller was
[479.96 --> 487.58]  just a screen and buttons and wireless yeah it was extremely light that's one of the reasons that
[487.58 --> 493.60]  the wii u controller was so comfortable it was also thick because it wasn't designed to be carried out
[493.60 --> 500.44]  and about with you the strius the steam deck is obviously thinner and is going for something more
[500.44 --> 506.90]  akin to a nintendo switch type of experience so that's something that is immediately going to be
[506.90 --> 513.88]  tough but but i also have i also have a counter argument to that that i'll get into a little bit
[513.88 --> 521.46]  later that involves this guy right here my main note about the wii u controller is the way that this
[521.46 --> 525.30]  shoulder button and i'm not saying this hasn't been done before by any alternatives which is i think
[525.30 --> 532.26]  what you're kind of getting into but the way that the the where you hold it is shaped the way the
[532.26 --> 541.14]  triggers are shaped those grip position of the thumbsticks and the abxy uh buttons that is all very
[541.14 --> 545.86]  nice my one of my biggest issues with the switch was that they put that one thumbstick in like the
[545.86 --> 552.26]  middle of the controller yeah and it made it really weird um and i really liked that the wii u had both
[552.26 --> 557.22]  the thumbsticks way at the top and it was kind of less great that the abxy was below it but you almost
[557.22 --> 561.30]  never used that so it didn't matter and i think it's pretty cool on this one how they're side by side i
[561.30 --> 566.26]  don't think that's going to be uncomfortable to control with smaller hands for small hands i have some
[566.26 --> 571.46]  concerns like if my kids tried to use this thing i don't for my hands it looks okay but if like my kids
[571.46 --> 576.10]  tried to use it or something like that i think it might be a little bit more challenging right it
[576.10 --> 583.06]  looks pretty darn well thought out and valve has a history of thinking through the ergonomics of things
[583.06 --> 587.70]  at least to the point where you can definitely go well they definitely thought this through i mean
[587.70 --> 592.50]  the uh the steam controller bloody hell what they call that thing did they just call it steam control
[592.50 --> 600.02]  they did the steam controller was ergonomic it's just that the touchpad didn't really work for me
[600.02 --> 604.98]  what's fascinating about this is that they clearly haven't abandoned the touchpad paradigm they just
[604.98 --> 611.22]  have recognized now that it's not perfect for everything they had us using the touchpad instead
[611.22 --> 618.90]  of joysticks whereas here now we've got a touchpad well actually rather touch pads in addition to
[618.90 --> 625.30]  joysticks which opens up all kinds of options both for ambidextrous players or left-handed players as well
[625.30 --> 631.14]  as for different gameplay styles like or different genres of games that you might want to play that's
[631.14 --> 639.94]  that's extremely exciting and i'm i am really i'm stoked to try it now it's got 16 gigs of lp ddr5 memory
[640.50 --> 647.70]  it's got a 40 watt hour battery that is extremely impressive considering the size of this thing stereo
[647.70 --> 653.62]  speakers analog triggers which is a big deal that's one of my complaints about the thing that i was going to
[653.62 --> 661.30]  talk about a little bit later a micro sd card up to 512 gigs of m.2 storage on board depending on which
[661.30 --> 668.66]  uh trim level you spring for and these twin 32 and a half millimeter touch pads claim that they have 55
[668.66 --> 673.62]  better latency compared to the steam controllers touch pads they are pressure sensitive and have hd
[673.62 --> 680.02]  haptics uh so that's just improved feedback on the touch pads when you're swiping across them pressing on
[680.02 --> 689.78]  them all that kind of stuff man six axis motion sensitivity okay that's pretty cool uh we did a
[689.78 --> 696.90]  video recently where i tried using the playstation 4 controllers uh gyro capabilities to game on pc
[696.90 --> 703.86]  there's like a hacky way that that you could do it and i was shocked at how intuitive it was compared to
[703.86 --> 709.86]  to trying to yeah trying to fine tune operate a joystick there's pro gamers out there that are
[709.86 --> 714.26]  great at it that's that's fine that's great that's wonderful but for someone who hasn't spent their
[714.26 --> 720.50]  whole life working on that skill boy is a gyro i think there's going to be some advanced tactic
[720.50 --> 724.82]  stuff too where you do a combination use the thumbstick for like big sweeping movements then you
[724.82 --> 729.30]  micro adjust with the aiming but i i think there's something that wasn't mentioned here or maybe i missed
[729.30 --> 734.50]  it maybe you said it and i didn't hear it but there's also the grip buttons on the back which
[735.14 --> 739.86]  i really like especially like it's always been really cool in the elite controllers and stuff but
[739.86 --> 744.98]  i think on this it makes even more sense because like i was talking about earlier all your controls
[744.98 --> 749.86]  being at the top the thumbsticks being in probably the best position which is the outside if i'm i think
[749.86 --> 755.78]  i'm correct with that the inside sorry um yeah the outside is a little maybe a little weird but um having
[755.78 --> 760.98]  those buttons on the back is going to make it so you don't have to move off which on a heavy device
[760.98 --> 765.14]  i think is going to actually be a pretty big deal yep you'll be able to keep your hands in one spot
[765.14 --> 769.30]  and be able to press buttons there i think it's going to be a much bigger deal than it's ever been
[769.30 --> 774.74]  on a controller i think it's going to be very very important on this device absolutely uh it's got two
[774.74 --> 783.78]  by two ac wi-fi bluetooth 5.0 a dual microphone array it can output 8k 60 uh because it's got display port
[783.78 --> 790.82]  1.4 built into its usb type c port and you can also use the usbc port to connect to the official
[790.82 --> 796.82]  dock yes that's right ladies and gentlemen there's a dock too uh it'll be sold separately more
[796.82 --> 804.02]  information coming soon but it's got display port hdmi uh type c as well as that looks like a an audio
[804.02 --> 808.90]  jack hold on a second it's in my notes uh but up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[808.90 --> 816.42]  usb 3.1 type a uh so two of those effectively it turns this into a full desktop pc experience
[816.42 --> 824.58]  there's ethernet and so there's one usb3 two usb2s sorry i think i misspoke earlier i don't see
[825.70 --> 830.18]  that's probably power that's probably power over on the left there because i would expect you to handle
[830.18 --> 839.70]  audio uh just plugging into the jack that's built into the steam deck itself man i i hope they get
[839.70 --> 848.26]  the joysticks right i mean it seems like everyone and their dog is going through joystick gate right
[848.26 --> 853.86]  now whether it's nintendo with their drift or whether it's sony that's had a real heck of a time with
[853.86 --> 858.90]  feedback on their playstation 5 controller which is otherwise freaking awesome to the point where
[858.90 --> 864.10]  microsoft is reportedly looking at doing a mid-generation refresh of their controller to try
[864.10 --> 872.74]  and achieve something closer to feature parity um i hope valve gets it just right on this thing but
[872.74 --> 879.38]  the reality of it is that it's extremely challenging to build both an accurate and robust joystick in
[879.38 --> 884.90]  something that is so low profile i understand why everyone's screwing it up even companies that have
[884.90 --> 892.90]  a ton of experience i just don't like it because joysticks not working sucks yes absolutely sucks
[893.46 --> 897.06]  if there's if there's anything that's going to make you want to put a game down that's that's
[897.06 --> 903.22]  definitely one of them three different trim levels okay the base model is and this is absolutely
[903.86 --> 909.78]  mind-blowing to me the base model is 399 us i just saw a comment on float plane saying they need to
[909.78 --> 915.78]  drop the price a hundred dollars in order to make this thing attractive are you kidding me this is a
[915.78 --> 925.62]  full computer for 400 this is basically in a chip shortage this is chromebook level pricing almost
[926.50 --> 932.90]  except that it's got a built-in what i'm assuming is high quality controller and it's going to be a
[932.90 --> 939.62]  relatively non-mainstream product i mean maybe uh gay man also came out and said they're expecting to sell
[939.62 --> 946.02]  quote millions of these things but man this this is an engineering challenge to build these things
[946.58 --> 952.26]  you know valve's got to make some money i mean there's somebody in the chat saying rich guy view
[952.90 --> 959.14]  rich guy view what are you talking about i feel like i often don't take the rich guy view and i would say
[959.14 --> 966.58]  if you expect that to be 2.99 you're out to freaking lunch um it's it's it's not that there's there's
[966.58 --> 974.02]  like it's just it's just wishful thinking um and sure you could say oh i really want this to be a
[974.02 --> 980.10]  hundred dollars because i'd love for it to be five yeah sure i'd love for it to be i'd love for it to be
[980.10 --> 985.30]  50 cents you know i just yeah maybe i could just maybe i could just wish on a star and one would fall into
[985.30 --> 993.30]  my lap but but you got to understand these things actually cost money do you have any idea how much
[993.30 --> 998.58]  the tooling for this device would have cost i mean we're talking valve was out seven figures before
[998.58 --> 1004.90]  they even put any computer hardware and even built one just to do the plastics for it like you gotta
[1004.90 --> 1010.98]  understand that right no not that low but a hundred dollars yes yeah but you're still just
[1010.98 --> 1014.98]  holding that out of your butt like this that's coming out of nowhere for the stuff that's in this
[1014.98 --> 1019.86]  especially during a chip shortage this is not an egregious price and i would love to say it is but
[1019.86 --> 1024.42]  it's it's just not let's ignore the chip shortage because by the time this thing ships um you know
[1024.42 --> 1027.94]  looking at what's happening with gpu pricing in china we're going to talk about that a little bit
[1027.94 --> 1033.94]  later on the show who knows maybe it's the elite the chip shortage will be alleviated somewhat but
[1033.94 --> 1039.38]  let's look at what else is on the market into manufacturing now because you can't just look at a
[1039.38 --> 1044.74]  product in a vacuum right you can't just say well it's more expensive than i would like therefore it
[1044.74 --> 1051.38]  should be cheaper everything has a cost and everything has to compete with what else is available in the
[1051.38 --> 1058.66]  market so let's look at what else is available in the market there's the nintendo switch which is 299 us
[1059.22 --> 1068.26]  for a flipping four year old armed cpu with a tegra gpr excuse me a tegra soc with an arm cpu and what
[1068.26 --> 1081.22]  is it like maxwell gpu on it uh tegra x1 is it maxwell i think it is yeah i mean we are talking ancient
[1081.22 --> 1089.30]  technology that wasn't cutting edge when the switch came out four years ago nintendo wants 299 for that
[1090.18 --> 1096.18]  okay now let's look at something that's way more comparable the a and neo which is the handheld that
[1096.18 --> 1102.82]  i've been holding up that is i think probably the most comparable thing to the steam deck on the market
[1102.82 --> 1109.06]  right now a this thing is barely even on the market so far they've only done a kickstarter
[1109.06 --> 1115.30]  excuse me indiegogo campaign for it so i don't even think you can just just buy one and have it
[1115.30 --> 1123.22]  ship immediately and now let's have a look at the pricing okay this by this guy starts at uh hold on
[1123.22 --> 1130.98]  a second here we go it was 880 canadian dollars so that's around 700 us dollars that sounds like a
[1130.98 --> 1137.14]  reasonable price but let's drop it by 100 bucks sorry i keep going at 100 no sorry sorry it was a
[1137.14 --> 1144.74]  joke based on the comment okay that's 300 higher with what is essentially very similar hardware okay
[1144.74 --> 1149.46]  not quite 300 higher because we're comparing it to the base model so let's go back to the
[1150.10 --> 1154.26]  that's pretty good though yeah i do want to jump in there so the the so yeah i'm just going to go
[1154.26 --> 1160.98]  through the model stuff quickly the base model is 399 us it has 64 gigs of emmc flash storage um and
[1160.98 --> 1166.66]  that's that's it you're just getting the device that's it if you go up to the 529 us model you get
[1166.66 --> 1173.46]  256 gigs of storage you get a carrying case and you get a steam community profile whatever might as
[1173.46 --> 1182.90]  well if you go up a bit more about 120 bucks to 649 us you go up to 512 gigs of nvme storage
[1183.78 --> 1188.98]  you get an exclusive carrying case you get an exclusive steam community profile and you get an
[1188.98 --> 1199.22]  exclusive virtual keyboard theme whatever something to note yeah those nvme drives replaceable yep so
[1199.22 --> 1204.10]  they're 30 millimeter 30 millimeter nvme drives this is where we get into the comparisons with the a
[1204.10 --> 1213.86]  neo a little bit so the a neo at its cheapest early bird price was 50 more than the comparably equipped
[1213.86 --> 1218.66]  steam deck there was a problem with the notes sorry there's a problem with the notes the base model
[1218.66 --> 1225.14]  does include a carrying case the the main difference on these two yeah sorry sorry sorry
[1225.14 --> 1233.14]  the main difference is that you go from 64 gigs of emmc to 256 gigs of nvme just straight up
[1233.14 --> 1238.10]  so it's it's faster storage more storage not a carrying case thing and you get the community
[1238.10 --> 1244.26]  profile sorry continue okay so back to back to the aneo a little bit let's talk some let's talk some
[1244.26 --> 1251.38]  pros and cons uh one of the things the aneo has is it's got way more usb expansion so it's got two usbc
[1251.38 --> 1258.90]  ports on the top that is flipping awesome uh it's got two more cpu cores okay it's got uh so it's got a
[1258.90 --> 1266.74]  ryzen 5 4500u that is a six core processor it's got uh let me have a look here what other sort of
[1266.74 --> 1271.94]  advantages it i mean i don't know if this one is actually making its way into the general public's
[1271.94 --> 1277.22]  hands but it has like built-in rgb lighting which i guess is kind of cool in the dark so you can see
[1277.22 --> 1280.74]  these green lights on the side i believe they can be configured they're breathing right now
[1281.70 --> 1288.34]  um what's the size of the battery i think it actually says right on the back here 47 watt hours
[1288.34 --> 1293.30]  so i think that's actually a little less if i recall correctly no it's actually a little bit more so it
[1293.30 --> 1300.74]  has a slightly bigger battery uh it takes full-sized 80 millimeter nvme uh drives so that's pretty cool as
[1300.74 --> 1307.78]  well but it doesn't have six axis uh motion controls uh it doesn't have the touch pads um
[1308.98 --> 1317.86]  i haven't seen valve screen yet but i i suspect the one on the uh the one on the steam i keep
[1317.86 --> 1322.90]  playing we'll come wanting to call it a steam pad now the one on the steam deck is probably going to
[1322.90 --> 1328.66]  be a little bit better this one is this one is pretty good they're both seven inches the point is these
[1328.66 --> 1333.94]  are fairly comparable devices oh the speakers are pretty bad on this thing to the point where
[1333.94 --> 1341.62]  apparently they're they're still tuning those now um and it's 50 more at the cheapest early bird price
[1342.34 --> 1351.70]  and then this thing was 789 and they sold 500 out of 500 of them this is a campaign that did two point
[1351.70 --> 1361.62]  like to like 2.2 2.3 million us dollars and to this day you cannot buy this thing because it is out of
[1361.62 --> 1373.22]  stock okay so you can say oh yeah valve is charging too much or whatever but if anything by offering that
[1373.22 --> 1381.30]  64 gig emmc option with micro sd expansion they have clearly done everything in their power to make
[1381.30 --> 1389.94]  this thing as affordable as possible this is not some cheapo arm soc this is a full-fledged pc
[1391.86 --> 1396.82]  it's freaking awesome and i'm not some kind of valve fanboy i have no problem calling them out when
[1396.82 --> 1402.74]  they do something stupid but you got to understand that you got to give credit where credit is due
[1402.74 --> 1409.38]  this hardware has a cost developing hardware has a cost and we can't expect valve to just
[1411.06 --> 1416.66]  give it away at a loss like i don't they're a for-profit company what do you guys want i'm i'm
[1416.66 --> 1422.82]  excited to get my hands on this thing and i think it's going to be a dinner beef and float plane chat
[1422.82 --> 1428.74]  says gabe said hitting that price was not easy i believe him oh yeah definitely yeah if the plastics
[1428.74 --> 1433.70]  quality of this thing not to mention just the the cost of getting them all assembled like there's a
[1433.70 --> 1438.66]  production cost of these things if it's anywhere near what i would expect from valve based on my other
[1438.66 --> 1446.82]  valve hardware this thing would have cost a freaking fortune to pr to create now angry panda pc over
[1446.82 --> 1450.74]  in float plane chat says the price to value debate doesn't make any sense on this device
[1450.74 --> 1455.46]  and i criticize so many modern devices for being overpriced actually no i have no idea what you're
[1455.46 --> 1462.90]  talking about so values in the eye of the beholder you can say it's not worth it to me absolutely
[1463.54 --> 1467.86]  that is a hundred percent i think this is going to be not worth it to a lot of people of course
[1467.86 --> 1474.98]  not that's okay that's fine it's just not yeah not everything has to be for everyone value is in the
[1474.98 --> 1484.90]  eye of the beholder but the price is aggressive jr 69 55 says psv to msrp 249 you you gotta understand
[1485.46 --> 1490.18]  like sorry what what are you talking about that's the hundred dollar guy just don't just oh is it
[1490.18 --> 1500.26]  really oh okay yeah yeah you're good don't worry about that uh uh wow okay an official doc is gonna be
[1500.26 --> 1505.78]  sold separately this is actually super we talked about that oh sorry yeah i hope there's uh unofficial
[1505.78 --> 1510.58]  ones as well one thing that's kind of stupid about the official doc and about the device actually i'm
[1510.58 --> 1516.58]  not a huge fan of this i saw some praise for it for having its usbc charging port on the top
[1516.58 --> 1523.14]  because they said it'll make it easier to game while you're charging um yeah i can see that because
[1523.14 --> 1527.30]  especially with a heavy device like this one this weighs about the same amount sometimes i do find
[1527.30 --> 1533.54]  myself wanting to rest it but i also don't mind resting it kind of like this with my wrists making
[1533.54 --> 1539.46]  it so that the cable can get out and having something hanging off the top i'm not a huge fan
[1539.46 --> 1544.98]  of that especially if it's kind of a bulkier wire and it also makes the dock kind of stupid because
[1544.98 --> 1550.82]  their dock requires you to put the thing in and then run a cable so it's not really a dock so much as
[1550.82 --> 1555.70]  it's a dongle you might have already said this considering you already mentioned the dock but
[1555.70 --> 1563.38]  uh they also said that regular usbc adapters will work fine um all all i doubt actually all but they
[1563.38 --> 1570.98]  said all usbc docks will work so i mean i see no reason why one wouldn't uh yeah i just you know
[1571.86 --> 1577.62]  i don't know a hazard to say just like literally anything will function yeah that's fair yeah all
[1577.62 --> 1581.46]  right but but i don't suspect you're going to run into issues is what i'm trying to get across great
[1581.46 --> 1585.54]  hershey chap over on floatplane says it would be cool if linux was on the steam deck kind of like
[1585.54 --> 1593.70]  steam machines hey i'm so glad you uh brought it up because yes it is running steam os what is it
[1593.70 --> 1603.86]  steam os 3.0 uh hold on blah blah blah oh where's my notes yep steam os 3.0 which is arch linux based
[1603.86 --> 1609.30]  uh it's got um let's see hold on there's some really good information in here
[1609.30 --> 1616.82]  yes now obviously because it's linux you're going to have some issues with game compatibilities
[1616.82 --> 1622.50]  particularly games with strong anti-cheat so there's a handful of games including shoot which
[1622.50 --> 1627.70]  one was i i was looking at a list of them before this and now i've gone and misplaced it uh but four
[1627.70 --> 1635.46]  of the top 10 games on steam right now have issues with anti-cheat in uh in linux uh running valve's
[1635.46 --> 1641.06]  proton but valve is apparently reaching out to those developers and trying to work specifically
[1641.06 --> 1647.22]  on those games to make sure that proton which is a compatibility layer that allows you to run windows
[1647.22 --> 1656.58]  games on linux will have proper support for those i am i am pretty excited so if you ever if you ever
[1656.58 --> 1661.94]  end up in a linux debate or linux conversation in general after owning one of these you can confidently say
[1661.94 --> 1670.34]  that you run arch i know right so their goal is for every game to work with proton by the time
[1670.34 --> 1674.74]  they ship steam deck that should give you some idea of how long this has been in the works what
[1674.74 --> 1680.58]  it seems like is they basically tried that whole steam machines thing which was like the the desktop
[1680.58 --> 1687.62]  or rather the tv consoles uh kind of went okay yeah this didn't work we didn't do the whole killer app
[1687.62 --> 1695.06]  thing um also it's just a computer it's hard to compete against just computers uh forget it see you
[1695.06 --> 1702.42]  later that project clearly never died it looks like it just transitioned to a handheld and the timing is
[1702.42 --> 1709.46]  so right for this to happen i mean we've watched it happen smaller companies like gpd have been bringing
[1709.46 --> 1716.18]  out devices like this for years now and they've always been pretty okay but this last generation i was
[1716.18 --> 1723.14]  extremely bullish on the gpd win 3 uh we covered the a neo founder we covered the oh man what's that
[1723.14 --> 1729.62]  thing called the the one x player all three of them were like pretty cool and had their pros and cons
[1729.62 --> 1734.98]  uh the one x player screen resolution was too high you couldn't drive it honestly it was too big at
[1734.98 --> 1743.78]  what was it like almost nine inches died 8.4 inches uh kind of too bulky um the gpd win 3 great a little
[1743.78 --> 1747.94]  bit hampered by its xc graphics honestly not because the performance sucks but because the
[1747.94 --> 1753.46]  drivers are an absolute mess or at least they were back when i covered it and then i think the a neo
[1753.46 --> 1759.22]  is the one that has struck the best balance out of all of those three i absolutely freaking love this
[1759.22 --> 1764.66]  thing you can see that i'm uh in the middle of a super mario rpg run through right now i've been using
[1764.66 --> 1771.46]  it for retro games i've been using it for modern games the seven inch screen is freaking awesome 720p at that
[1771.46 --> 1779.22]  size it's fine and that's a lot of what i based my take uh for this switch oled my take that 720p was
[1779.22 --> 1784.34]  still okay even with the larger screen was actually based on doing so much of my gaming on the a neo
[1784.34 --> 1789.30]  lately and finding it it's fine yeah it's not the sharpest thing ever whatever you want the sharpest
[1789.30 --> 1794.74]  thing ever go get an iphone like it's not like you can't get a sharper display but if you want to play pc
[1794.74 --> 1801.06]  games i'd rather run them at native at a lower native resolution than running at a non-native
[1801.06 --> 1806.74]  resolution on my awesome high resolution display and the same is going to be true of the switch since
[1806.74 --> 1812.42]  nintendo didn't upgrade the hardware i i don't know maybe i'm maybe i'm being kind of defensive about
[1812.42 --> 1818.98]  this because you know i can see the work they put into it i can see the cost they put into it i'm
[1818.98 --> 1825.94]  extremely excited i'm passionate about these handheld pcs becoming a thing and i'm just finding
[1825.94 --> 1833.70]  this thing really exciting and so maybe i'm not being completely objective uh but i'm excited now
[1834.50 --> 1838.82]  now i want to know how stupid uh does dell feel
[1841.62 --> 1848.82]  okay do you remember this thing hold on a second uh in in in valve's statements and they
[1848.82 --> 1855.62]  did this with the the steam pc as well i don't think they're trying to win this market i'm trying
[1855.62 --> 1860.82]  to i think they're trying to push this market forward so i don't think dell is out yeah but
[1860.82 --> 1867.06]  they've lost a lot of mind share by not just shipping this thing at some sure i mean they showed
[1867.06 --> 1876.10]  it a year and a half ago in a basically working state so yeah that's a little rough
[1876.10 --> 1884.50]  yeah and back to me being really passionate and defending this thing video cards has this
[1884.50 --> 1890.02]  excellent little table of all the similar products here so you've got your nintendo switch and switch
[1890.02 --> 1895.62]  light you've got your gpd win 3 hold on a second let me blow this up okay apparently i cannot well
[1895.62 --> 1900.50]  whatever call that good enough uh your gpd win 3 they've all got their pros and cons the win 3's got
[1900.50 --> 1906.90]  this keyboard so if you you know enter text often but not that often you know that can be pretty cool
[1906.90 --> 1912.98]  i guess uh it's smaller this is actually pocketable whereas none of these other ones are particularly
[1912.98 --> 1918.58]  pocketable it's only got a five and a half inch display um the a neo man this this thing is freaking
[1918.58 --> 1926.50]  awesome um probably a very very similar spec to what we're going to get with the steam i keep struggling
[1926.50 --> 1934.18]  i keep struggling to to come up with the name um the the steam deck uh hold on i actually want to
[1934.18 --> 1939.86]  double check because i didn't remember this thing having six cores but maybe i'm just yeah i'm drunk
[1939.86 --> 1947.62]  it does it totally has six cores six threads uh the the uh one x player right here it has the biggest
[1947.62 --> 1953.06]  screen but kind of hampered by xc graphics blah blah blah like they've all got their pros and cons i think
[1953.06 --> 1958.18]  a neo also has like pretty pretty compelling pricing even though it's higher it's actually
[1958.18 --> 1966.34]  higher than the steam deck um man okay there's a few things actually as someone who would be likely
[1966.34 --> 1970.74]  to just install windows on the thing because there's stuff that i do on it other than just
[1971.30 --> 1978.42]  you know use a browser and play games uh also windows is just my comfort zone the a neo looks like
[1978.42 --> 1983.62]  a probably a better windows machine just because they've got these uh like these shortcut keys
[1983.62 --> 1988.74]  so you've got a windows button whoop whoop there we go you got a windows button you've got a button
[1988.74 --> 1993.46]  to bring up the on-screen keyboard escape task manager task manager is really useful because no
[1993.46 --> 1998.10]  it's really useful because no i didn't mean it that way i was frowning because i was i was thinking in
[1998.10 --> 2003.70]  my head like you might be able to bind some of the keys on the you probably could some of the back
[2003.70 --> 2008.34]  ones because it's so bad but steam deck uh but yeah you could probably bind some of those to those
[2008.34 --> 2011.62]  types of functions but yeah sorry keep going maybe you could you don't want to hit them by accident
[2011.62 --> 2018.10]  either though um but maybe you could bind some of the front ones if you use the back ones more often
[2018.10 --> 2023.06]  which honestly i think someone who's like min maxing their experience because of that hand position
[2023.06 --> 2028.98]  thing i was talking about might do that i guess so uh i don't know yeah i like anyway the point is i
[2028.98 --> 2038.90]  like those buttons also believe it or not um i like the i like the top uh abxy i like the top abxy
[2038.90 --> 2045.22]  i don't like the symmetrical joysticks i think that the steam deck is gonna is gonna win me over anyway
[2045.22 --> 2050.74]  just because they're they're kind of in line you just reach over your abxy if you need the dual joysticks
[2050.74 --> 2055.46]  i'm i'm pretty into that but it's the kind of thing that i'm gonna have to actually get hands-on with
[2055.46 --> 2063.14]  before i can draw any kind of conclusion one big downer about the aneo is that these triggers are
[2063.14 --> 2070.82]  not analog they are just binary on or off triggers but my understanding is that the aneo is they said
[2070.82 --> 2074.26]  you can bind the touchpads apparently that's something that i probably wouldn't use so that
[2074.26 --> 2080.18]  i could be pretty into that uh oh you could you could probably bind parts of the touchpad i would
[2080.18 --> 2085.14]  think so yeah because if i recall correctly you could do cool stuff like that on the steam controller
[2085.14 --> 2091.54]  you might even be able to do gestures yep cash manager like an x all right that could be pretty
[2091.54 --> 2098.58]  cool that'd be pretty sweet that could be pretty cool oh man i'm excited man uh everyone's an
[2098.58 --> 2106.18]  analyst peeves says no not peeves uh hold on a second uh blah blah blah nico you says or nico a neo
[2106.18 --> 2110.42]  and gpd's fault is the moment when they chose to use windows yeah but you gotta understand they didn't
[2110.42 --> 2119.30]  have the development resources to build proton i mean what other company other than valve could
[2119.30 --> 2124.26]  possibly have tackled that project hit me with one
[2129.06 --> 2136.50]  yeah i mean yeah maybe maybe epic you know could have pushed into it earlier to because so many games
[2136.50 --> 2141.78]  are powered by unreal engine you know like there's but there's companies that could but they wouldn't
[2141.78 --> 2147.06]  have the experience or the expertise to really do it properly or the motivation or the yeah stick with
[2147.06 --> 2154.02]  it there's basically no one else is going to do it yeah microsoft yeah nice yeah sure yeah for sure
[2154.02 --> 2162.50]  they're for sure there bud they could yeah yeah yeah i mean haters gonna hate there's people that are just
[2162.50 --> 2168.10]  not into it and not excited about that about it i see that in the comments but for people who are
[2168.66 --> 2171.30]  okay hold on a second i'll be right back
[2173.94 --> 2178.34]  while he's gone i want to talk about something it's not in the doc or i might have missed it
[2179.22 --> 2184.10]  um skimming through i don't think it's in the doc um i don't think it was i don't know if it was
[2184.10 --> 2189.86]  technically this week i asked people what the date was they said it i blurred out and didn't really read
[2189.86 --> 2194.98]  it but github copilot oh he's already back i thought he's gonna be gone for longer github copilot
[2196.74 --> 2201.14]  is crazy i've been talking for at least a decade about how something like this
[2201.70 --> 2206.98]  was needed something like this was going to happen and this is a thousand percent the future i don't
[2206.98 --> 2214.10]  know if this exact version of it is or not but this type of thing is definitely the future yeah we
[2214.10 --> 2219.70]  got to talk about that later yeah okay sorry okay get back to back to this conversation for anyone
[2219.70 --> 2227.14]  who loved the shield i mean the real shield not the shield tablet which i think got renamed shield or
[2227.14 --> 2234.50]  the no no the shield console the android tv thing that got named shield later the original nvidia shield
[2234.50 --> 2241.62]  for anyone who loved this thing you've been waiting for a legitimate actual replacement for this thing
[2241.62 --> 2250.90]  for what like six years five years it's been a long freaking time well it finally happened you're
[2250.90 --> 2256.58]  running a full fat linux install and valve has even come out and said hey if you want to go ahead
[2256.58 --> 2265.54]  and huck windows on it there is a legitimate reason to be extremely excited right now so sure you know what
[2265.54 --> 2271.46]  you don't care about it that's fine but you got to recognize it for what it is a full fat computer
[2271.94 --> 2279.54]  in a super thin portable form factor that can play full fat pc games it can stream games from your more
[2279.54 --> 2287.62]  powerful desktop it can play i can play emulated games you've got this enormous back catalog potentially
[2288.42 --> 2295.54]  it's just super cool it's cool tech and if you don't like it then i think that you might not be
[2295.54 --> 2302.98]  looking outside of your own needs and just appreciating it for the amazing technology that it is
[2303.54 --> 2306.82]  that's all i have to say all right
[2309.22 --> 2313.78]  let's talk about that it's not actually in the doc but i was reading about it as well let's uh let's
[2313.78 --> 2320.82]  talk about that luke jump get us up to speed github copilot well yeah i don't know how this this
[2320.82 --> 2325.78]  passed by me but i didn't know about it until now um oh really someone asked someone asked in
[2325.78 --> 2331.22]  flow plane chat are you guys going to talk about github copilot and i was like copilot i haven't heard
[2331.22 --> 2337.54]  of this and i looked it up and my brain was immediately blown um the fact that it's powered
[2337.54 --> 2344.82]  by open ai just totally makes sense and gives me a lot more confidence in it than other similar ideas
[2344.82 --> 2348.98]  that have been talked about slash announced slash done in the past and have always had some form of
[2348.98 --> 2355.46]  issue this is crazy so why don't you talk about what it's supposed to do and then i can talk about
[2355.46 --> 2362.34]  some of the controversy around it already oh i'm sure there's lots um and i'm sure it's not going to
[2362.34 --> 2367.06]  matter because i'm sure it's going to happen anyways so github copilot it is supposed to suggest
[2368.26 --> 2373.06]  whole lines or entire functions of code and if you see their example i don't know if you're showing
[2373.06 --> 2381.30]  this on screen or not uh they're they're typing the first line of a of a function and it's it's
[2381.30 --> 2391.46]  auto completing the rest of it like crazy um not the examples that they're giving aren't necessarily all
[2391.46 --> 2400.66]  that out of this world um but even like it's just just it's just the general concept of something
[2400.66 --> 2407.78]  that helps you develop by suggesting things and giving a guiding hand has been needed for a long
[2407.78 --> 2413.62]  time and will absolutely be something that's used yes on the extreme end of programming a lot of very
[2413.62 --> 2419.46]  seasoned programmers aren't going to want or likely won't use something like this unless they can find
[2419.46 --> 2425.94]  a way for it to be very very lightweight and out of their way so they can use it just as a speed increase
[2425.94 --> 2430.50]  so they don't have to type certain things that's like pretty much probably the only way it's going to
[2430.50 --> 2437.46]  be used on the really high end what this is going to be groundbreaking for is new programmers going to
[2437.46 --> 2443.46]  be huge people that want to develop some little home automation thing for fun that they can do at
[2443.46 --> 2449.62]  home people that want to learn some basics um and can start you know known enough to be dangerous but
[2449.62 --> 2456.98]  can't really get a ton of things done um it's going to be massive and the further this goes forward the
[2456.98 --> 2462.66]  lower the lower the barrier of entry into development is going to be and the easier it's going to be for
[2462.66 --> 2469.54]  individuals to develop their own things without being a seasoned professional which is massive super
[2469.54 --> 2474.98]  super big deal and i'm sure we're just seeing like the beginning splashes of of what this can do
[2474.98 --> 2479.38]  considering it's powered by open ai we're going to see this grow and become stronger over time
[2479.62 --> 2486.26]  all right now let's talk about some of the uh controversy around it as with any kind of machine
[2486.26 --> 2496.18]  learning or ai tool uh copilot has to have some kind of data set that is done how exactly would it know
[2497.22 --> 2505.62]  how to complete that line uh if it didn't have some examples of code that had been written in the past
[2505.62 --> 2514.42]  now because this is coming from github i think you guys see where i'm going with this the potential
[2514.42 --> 2526.34]  for github to just scrape all of the code submitted to the entire platform and then use it to train their ai
[2527.14 --> 2534.34]  is very high and that creates a number of problems i mean one problem is that the quality of the code could be
[2534.90 --> 2540.90]  sketchy at best it might not be the most optimized code that it suggests for your auto complete and
[2540.90 --> 2552.18]  number two is that the licensing for code doesn't really have any provision for this one way or the
[2552.18 --> 2562.34]  other to my understanding so without a developer's express consent github might be training their ai based on
[2562.34 --> 2571.30]  their code which in and of itself is not necessarily plagiarism but then if it goes and suggests that
[2571.30 --> 2582.50]  exact snippet to another developer are they then as this middleman causing one developer to plagiarize the
[2582.50 --> 2591.86]  code of another without even knowing it yeah whoa crazy so here's something oh hold on i just want to
[2591.86 --> 2600.02]  talk about this uh kyle kyle who posted congrats at david sellis you get a shout out if github copilot
[2600.02 --> 2605.70]  tries to generate an about me page look at this about me i'm a software engineer from the bay area
[2605.70 --> 2611.94]  currently working at salesforce i love to learn new things and build things i have i have a
[2611.94 --> 2624.50]  a github account that's accept solution that's auto-generated like that was clearly pulled
[2624.50 --> 2634.26]  straight off of david's website as uh as as jaden says it it says in quotes trained on billions of
[2634.26 --> 2642.02]  lines of public code um like directly on the landing page so so yeah that that is that is exactly what's
[2642.02 --> 2649.54]  happening yeah it's pretty nuts you you can literally have it like if you get into some of these examples
[2649.54 --> 2656.74]  that they have you you can write comments and it'll write the whole thing for you it'll try at least
[2657.38 --> 2662.34]  yeah write a comment describing the logic you want and let github copilot assemble the code for you
[2662.34 --> 2667.38]  it's gonna be exactly what you want is it gonna be efficient is it gonna be whatever else i don't know
[2668.10 --> 2673.86]  but the fact that it's even gonna try is wild um like what do schools do
[2673.86 --> 2687.30]  uh i don't know because it's probably because of how um open ai works it's probably not going to be
[2687.30 --> 2693.38]  the same every time so you're not going to be able to maybe you can like train people to use copilot
[2694.26 --> 2700.58]  or what like i don't know what i mean is like how do you verify that copilot just didn't write an
[2700.58 --> 2710.02]  entire student's assignment that's that's difficult because they could write a description for example
[2710.02 --> 2713.22]  they should they could write a comment that describes what they want the code block to do
[2713.22 --> 2716.58]  yeah have the code block get generated and then change the comment
[2718.18 --> 2721.14]  it's like you don't know what led to the generation of that code like
[2722.58 --> 2726.74]  that's a difficult problem for uh well tony and wolf in twitch chat says it's going to lead to the
[2726.74 --> 2732.82]  replication of bugs across different software packages uh yeah yeah i think that's uh i think
[2732.82 --> 2738.50]  that's going to be a broad plains instant cs major degree speed run oh man
[2742.26 --> 2748.58]  that would be a really you know what that would be really interesting if like if like a university teacher
[2750.66 --> 2756.74]  gave this thing homework yeah and saw how well it scored like on multiple
[2756.74 --> 2764.90]  levels of uh of courses that would be really interesting i'll be interested to see how this is going to shake out
[2764.90 --> 2772.98]  i'll be interested to see how the legal challenges to um i guess what microsoft's use of this code um
[2773.78 --> 2774.82]  ends up shaking out
[2777.54 --> 2780.26]  regardless of what happens this is going to have
[2780.26 --> 2787.94]  like i'm not going to have an immense impact on the world and like i i honestly like i'm not i don't
[2787.94 --> 2795.06]  think i'm sugarcoating that this is massive yeah like so much of the future is software development
[2795.06 --> 2800.66]  and programming and coding we talked about on the lan show a long time ago how you should probably teach
[2801.78 --> 2807.14]  your kids to code regardless of what they want to do in the future they should probably understand to a certain
[2807.14 --> 2816.58]  degree some amount of software development um and this is massive because of all of that this is
[2816.58 --> 2821.30]  just absolutely huge and it's just going to get better and it's just going to grow because there's
[2821.30 --> 2824.98]  whatever legal problems they have i can pretty much guarantee they're going to make it through it
[2824.98 --> 2832.82]  because this is crazy and this is this is going to go away with money yep yep like this this is nuts yeah
[2832.82 --> 2842.58]  all right let's uh talk about our sponsors the show is brought to you today by pulseway.com

[2990.58 --> 2998.42]  slash when and use offer code when to get 10 off what's our next topic we've actually got like so many
[2998.42 --> 3004.82]  things that i kind of wanted to talk about today but we talked about other stuff a lot we did tsmc
[3004.82 --> 3014.90]  explores on-chip water cooling uh there's another yeah there's another crazy uh fab topic near the
[3014.90 --> 3020.26]  bottom of the dock dock which is huge but yes we can we can talk about on-chip water cooling first all
[3020.26 --> 3027.46]  right cool so german tech site hardware lux has reported on a presentation given by tsmc
[3027.46 --> 3034.58]  researchers at the latest vlsi symposium exploring new ways to cool silicon chips with the advent of
[3034.58 --> 3040.02]  vertical 3d stacking of transistors to densify performance cooling is going to become even more
[3040.02 --> 3045.46]  challenging because heat from lower levels of the stack won't be easily dissipated the researchers from
[3045.46 --> 3053.54]  tsmc tested three cooling methods with integrated silicon micro channels etched in both a grid and
[3053.54 --> 3059.94]  linear pattern in their tests so water would flow from one side to the other taking the heat with it
[3060.98 --> 3066.90]  this is incredible so for their tests they built a uh what do they call this thing a thermal test vehicle
[3066.90 --> 3074.26]  so we've got a slide from the presentation looks a little something like this okay uh so this is direct
[3074.26 --> 3083.70]  water cooling okay silicon here so silicon lid with liquid metal thermal interface material okay oh my
[3083.70 --> 3092.26]  goodness this is this is so cool i absolutely freaking love it um their last prototype had the micro
[3092.26 --> 3098.10]  channels etched on the ttv directly and they dubbed this direct water cooling it was the most effective
[3098.10 --> 3103.94]  dissipating 2.6 kilowatts of heat with a temperature delta of 63 degrees celsius
[3104.26 --> 3114.18]  cool direct water cooling look at this madness we're talking water in channels in the silicon
[3114.90 --> 3121.70]  okay and this is compared to having thermal interface material uh between what is this two layers of
[3121.70 --> 3127.78]  silicon okay that's interesting i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to dig into this a little bit more
[3127.78 --> 3131.70]  the point is water channels in silicon wow
[3135.70 --> 3140.50]  uh the grid pattern was found to be the most effective or more effective than the uh just the
[3140.50 --> 3147.46]  slots uh the linear pattern and uh yeah i guess that's pretty much that's pretty much it for that
[3147.46 --> 3152.10]  that's cool i hope to see it in the future uh realistically this is going to be the kind of thing you're going to
[3152.10 --> 3158.74]  see in like very specialized silicon more like industrial enterprise like supercomputer applications
[3158.74 --> 3164.90]  before you see it on a consumer product but yeah i mean that technology has a tendency to trickle its
[3164.90 --> 3173.46]  way down to the consumer and i would certainly be into it you think that one would i doubt it yeah but you
[3173.46 --> 3181.94]  never know i mean a microprocessor in general started out as something that was not consumer grade so never
[3181.94 --> 3190.34]  say never that's what i've learned sure yeah i could also i so what i immediately jumped to was like diy pcs
[3191.46 --> 3196.58]  i feel like it might be a bit of a stretch there but maybe in like non-user
[3196.58 --> 3204.58]  not friendly to user repair devices right where it's kind of built into everything and it comes
[3204.58 --> 3211.14]  as a package i could see that being a thing um but yeah anyways let's let's scroll down a fair amount
[3211.14 --> 3220.10]  i think and talk about uh this which very likely won't happen but yeah uh intel is in talks to buy global
[3220.10 --> 3222.90]  foundries for 30 billion dollars
[3226.10 --> 3232.02]  dang how trick is new ceo has been looking for ways to spend money apparently and as part of these 50
[3232.02 --> 3240.74]  billion dollar plus price tag for his renaissance what intel is looking to buy global foundries um
[3240.74 --> 3243.94]  that's amazing if you've watched this show ever you probably know who they are they're a fab
[3243.94 --> 3250.02]  um some of global foundries major customers have included amd apple qualcomm uh zelenix asus
[3250.02 --> 3256.58]  cisco google lenovo they make a lot of stuff it's a pretty big deal it's interesting the most
[3256.58 --> 3264.42]  mind-blowing part of it though is global foundries origin so global foundries was spun off back in 2009
[3264.42 --> 3272.50]  from amd so this would effectively i mean okay there's 12 years in between and you know a lot of
[3272.50 --> 3276.66]  a lot of business dealings the the relationship between amd and global foundries has apparently
[3276.66 --> 3284.02]  soured somewhat over the last decade plus but this is effectively intel buying amd's fabs
[3286.58 --> 3294.42]  and global foundries currently serves amd which i'm sure you'd get into tons of legal problems if
[3294.42 --> 3303.86]  they tried to stop after they bought it so intel might own amd's fab but then intel has also said that
[3303.86 --> 3308.82]  they're going to explore the idea of utilizing their own fab capacity for third-party independent
[3308.82 --> 3314.50]  customers so yes maybe interesting when you're doing it when you're serving the people that are
[3314.50 --> 3320.74]  currently kind of destroying you competing with you yeah yeah well i mean samsung does it it's not like
[3320.74 --> 3327.94]  samsung has never produced an soc for apple who they compete with directly it's just that samsung's fab
[3327.94 --> 3334.26]  business is just a different it's a separate business so if intel decided okay yeah we're just
[3334.26 --> 3340.34]  going to treat that as a completely separate business unit intel foundry services um maybe it's
[3340.34 --> 3347.86]  not that crazy i mean i'm sure if i'm amd i still just don't want to line intel's pockets in any way
[3347.86 --> 3354.90]  whatsoever to help them compete with me better but if it helps me compete better then maybe i do it anyway i
[3354.90 --> 3362.98]  i i i don't know man i don't know it's pretty it's pretty rough um we've got another topic here
[3362.98 --> 3369.94]  also from anthony amd fidelity effects super resolution is officially open source uh anthony
[3369.94 --> 3375.14]  writes linus before you yell at me for putting in too many wan topics it's 4 pm and nobody else is
[3375.14 --> 3381.46]  adding topics already pinged everyone else multiple times so here i am picking up the slack you're welcome
[3381.46 --> 3391.06]  all in caps amd's easy to implement upscaler has been officially added to their gpu open repository
[3391.06 --> 3397.54]  uh we found that fsr provides decent visual quality and performance in its ultra setting but ultimately
[3397.54 --> 3403.54]  does fall short of dlss digital foundry compared it to unreal engines temporal a upscaling algorithm
[3403.54 --> 3410.34]  and found that without the temporal element fsr did fall short however many games don't have access
[3410.34 --> 3415.14]  to upscalers that sophisticated and won't bother upscaling at all leaving it to the gpu to
[3415.14 --> 3420.82]  effectively stretch the image so fsr being open source means it's now freely available to developers
[3420.82 --> 3425.86]  and modders who want to take a crack at implementing it in games this open nature makes it more universally
[3425.86 --> 3432.26]  available because dlss relies on nvidia's tensor cores which you will only find in their 2000 and 3000
[3432.26 --> 3437.22]  series gpus so with the source code released the community can also contribute patches and improve the
[3437.22 --> 3442.10]  design of the scaler which would be pretty cool allowing it to maybe reach the level of unreal
[3442.10 --> 3451.22]  engines taau except in any engine uh meanwhile microsoft is apparently working on a deep learning
[3451.22 --> 3457.30]  uh upscaling technology of their own that would be part of direct x12 at some point in the future
[3457.30 --> 3463.62]  so that would be platform agnostic as well but i have no idea how well it would run obviously microsoft
[3463.62 --> 3467.86]  is i don't know actually nothing's obvious with microsoft anymore maybe they wouldn't have that
[3467.86 --> 3472.66]  much interest in it running in on alternate platforms i'm not sure i don't know how would
[3472.66 --> 3482.58]  valve find a way to hack it working in protons i i have no idea so um maybe deep learning powered super
[3482.58 --> 3488.26]  sampling won't be nvidia exclusive forever maybe fidelity effects ultimately doesn't end up mattering
[3488.26 --> 3493.62]  or maybe they just coexist and it's just yet another tool in your tool belt for making your
[3493.62 --> 3496.74]  games look better at higher resolutions on lesser hardware
[3499.54 --> 3508.34]  yeah um speaking of lesser hardware uh microsoft announces windows 365 it's probably not what you think
[3508.34 --> 3514.34]  it is not subscription windows uh in the sense that you just you have a computer and you pay a
[3514.34 --> 3525.14]  subscription to have windows it is not that um it there ah so azure virtual desktop which probably
[3525.14 --> 3530.42]  none of you know about unless you're really into that type of stuff has existed for a long time but
[3530.42 --> 3536.98]  this is is now for the everybody essentially uh it's a virtual private desktop in the cloud running
[3536.98 --> 3542.10]  windows 10 eventually windows 11 don't worry about that it is currently geared towards small businesses
[3542.10 --> 3548.18]  and i i don't think it says this in particular but i highly suspect education institutions it's going
[3548.18 --> 3554.90]  to be massive for because pretty much everyone there just needs like a browser and a word uh document
[3554.90 --> 3564.58]  editor um and that's amazing for this it's it's aimed at uh deployments of under 300 machines uh there's
[3564.58 --> 3569.86]  a management interface so you can see a clear overview of every virtual desktop you have access to which is
[3569.86 --> 3574.02]  actually kind of cool because you might have access to more than one i could see situations where that
[3574.02 --> 3582.18]  would make sense um each virtual desktop has microsoft office if you have very low spec um setups you get
[3582.18 --> 3587.46]  web versions which is fine it has edge it has one drive it has array of other software it's really fantastic
[3587.46 --> 3592.10]  for microsoft to get you in on this because you're probably gonna be using a lot of their first party tools
[3592.10 --> 3599.22]  um all virtual desktops come with 10 gigabit per second download speeds and 4 gigabit per second upload speeds
[3599.94 --> 3606.02]  and the pricing is going to vary there are going to be a multitude of configurations one two four six
[3606.02 --> 3614.34]  and eight uh virtual cpu cores two four eight sixteen thirty two gigs of ram 64 128 256 and 512 gigs of storage
[3616.34 --> 3621.06]  and apparently there's going to be more pricing information and whatnot on august the second you could
[3621.06 --> 3625.06]  do some real work with some of those specs like for school we're not talking just like
[3625.78 --> 3630.74]  docs necessarily we're talking you could do you know some actual engineering work and stuff like that
[3630.74 --> 3635.38]  and there's plenty of room for them to expand the offering in the future maybe offer dedicated gpus or
[3635.38 --> 3642.10]  whatever the case may be uh amazon workspaces does offer similar configs but doesn't come with office
[3642.10 --> 3647.78]  citrix workspace offers lower prices but starts at 500 seats um
[3647.78 --> 3653.78]  so microsoft is looking reasonably competitive here and you know what good for them and i'm glad that i don't have
[3653.78 --> 3658.50]  to pay subscription for running windows on my desktop yay yeah
[3658.50 --> 3667.70]  in other news the specs for three of intel's next gen alder lake s cpus have been leaked thanks to a user on zhu
[3667.70 --> 3674.58]  who these uh leaks are supposedly based on qualification samples which would mean they should be pretty
[3674.58 --> 3684.74]  close to final so the i9 12 900k i7 12 700k and i5 12 600k alder lake s is a big little style cpu so
[3684.74 --> 3691.70]  it's going to have 24 threads of which the big eight cores each have two threads with hyper threading and
[3691.70 --> 3699.46]  then the small eight cores do not have hyper threading uh the lower end chips are 12 core
[3700.02 --> 3710.42]  20 thread and then 10 core 16 threads so okay so that one get only gets six of the low power cores
[3710.42 --> 3715.62]  on the i5 and then it's eight on both the i7 and the i9 oh man this is going to be hard to keep track
[3715.62 --> 3721.62]  of so the 12 900k will be capable of boosting up to 5.3 gigahertz on one to two big cores
[3721.62 --> 3726.66]  and five gigahertz across all big cores and these chips are apparently going to have two tdps
[3727.22 --> 3736.34]  at pl1 and pl2 with all three rated at 125 watts and 228 watts respectively they're built in at 10
[3736.34 --> 3742.18]  nanometer and the e-course will apparently boost much lower than the larger p-cores but that's
[3742.18 --> 3745.38]  intentional because they aren't designed for performance they're designed for power saving
[3746.82 --> 3751.38]  these chips are going to support ddr5 and pci express gen 5 and if these are truly the specs
[3751.38 --> 3757.78]  based on qualification samples um it's likely that this is this is it this is what you're getting
[3757.78 --> 3767.78]  so for better or for worse the performance looks interesting um adjusting for the qs clock speeds
[3767.78 --> 3777.30]  and looking at es benchmarks that we saw it's estimated that a the i9 will hit around 11 300 points
[3777.30 --> 3780.98]  which would actually which would actually put it a thousand points ahead of the 5950x
[3782.34 --> 3789.14]  huh with that said it's not like amd is sitting still uh we are we are expecting refresh processors
[3789.14 --> 3795.38]  from amd we just don't know exactly what they're going to be uh amd may be skipping zen 3 plus and
[3795.38 --> 3801.62]  just releasing a zen 3 refresh of xt processors uh which could mean that intel has the performance crown
[3801.62 --> 3806.66]  back for one generation while amd waits to leapfrog them again how exciting is it to have intel and
[3806.66 --> 3812.26]  amd leapfrogging each other again it's cool that's what i love to see i don't even care who wins i just
[3812.26 --> 3820.82]  i wish they both are trying yeah yeah that's the key i hope the software starts to try to and i know some
[3820.82 --> 3827.78]  of it definitely definitely does but i hope the consumer grade software starts to kind of catch up a little bit
[3827.78 --> 3835.38]  uh oh we've got some other interesting news so if you like the ltt underwear but you don't actually
[3835.38 --> 3843.14]  like the new designs we did a reprint of the old designs with the new supplier so we have two
[3843.14 --> 3848.58]  different three packs now we have the old design three pack right here and then we have the new
[3848.58 --> 3856.66]  design three pack right here so if you prefer the uh the stripy the stripy boys we did super cheap uh
[3856.66 --> 3863.46]  photoshop a super cheap photoshop job to turn the bands black so the new bands are just plain black
[3863.46 --> 3869.86]  like the new design ones instead of having the like l linus tech tips all around it um just gives
[3869.86 --> 3874.66]  it kind of a cleaner look they still do have the little rubberized logo like that but they are now
[3874.66 --> 3881.46]  available yay all this stuff is taking way longer than i had hoped and i guess that's pretty much oh yeah
[3881.46 --> 3886.98]  netflix gaming is a thing uh i don't think there's really i don't think anyone knows really too much
[3886.98 --> 3891.94]  about it yeah yeah but netflix wants to get into gaming i think what netflix should get into is not
[3891.94 --> 3897.38]  just canceling every show that they start that's what netflix should get into if they want to build loyalty
[3898.50 --> 3903.94]  with sort of you know passionate fans who are into more niche shows because like i thought that was what
[3903.94 --> 3909.70]  they were good at but that's a whole that's a whole other that's a whole other conversation just like the
[3909.70 --> 3914.18]  super chats are a whole other conversation i managed to pick the thing this time so i've i've got them
[3914.18 --> 3921.22]  all um troy asks did you know about the nest adapter for two-wire thermostats uh yes i'm aware of that
[3921.22 --> 3927.30]  my issue with nest is that it's cloud-based and i want everything local controlled so that i get that
[3927.30 --> 3933.70]  nice responsiveness uh zultane says i'm a night shift worker in ontario just wanted to send a couple bucks
[3933.70 --> 3937.62]  say thanks for keeping me up during my ride to work and the first bit of work before the coffee kicks in
[3937.62 --> 3943.78]  hey no problem we got you uh floober job he says they should have called it the smp
[3943.78 --> 3949.30]  steam mobile platform sure i'd be into that yeah um
[3952.10 --> 3958.02]  ooh stefan says will you guys please test some popular big games like gta 5 red dead redemption 2
[3958.02 --> 3965.62]  running from a reasonably fast micro sd you could do it on a pc before the deck launches or or you could
[3965.62 --> 3971.54]  disable a couple of cores and do it on the a and neo which would actually probably give us a pretty
[3971.54 --> 3976.90]  darn good idea of what we're dealing with this thing has a oh snap does this thing not have a micro sd
[3976.90 --> 3987.54]  slot i did not realize that advantage steam deck mind you it supports full-sized m.2s as long as they
[3987.54 --> 3993.62]  are i believe they have to be single-sided but that means you can go up to four terabytes like with your
[3993.62 --> 3999.86]  ssd but then you're spending eight hundred dollars uh if you go with like a wd black or something like
[3999.86 --> 4003.94]  that on a device that costs less than eight hundred dollars i don't know it's a whole other thing
[4004.58 --> 4012.50]  uh okay uh finley hey thanks finley thanks cold bud three uh lewis says iphones cost twelve hundred
[4012.50 --> 4018.50]  dollars and no one bats an eye thank you the steam deck being four hundred dollars is freaking incredible
[4018.50 --> 4024.74]  uh robert mail says can we get some spoilers on upcoming home automation collabs um i mean i already
[4024.74 --> 4031.06]  the only person that i have worked with so far i talked about in my previous video uh we're actually
[4031.06 --> 4037.70]  we're working through a lot of it jake man jake digs his teeth into projects like this he has already
[4037.70 --> 4044.74]  basically got the proof of concept for the per zone ac control with smart dampers working so we are
[4044.74 --> 4048.42]  planning to shoot a video i'm actually off next week but we're planning to shoot a video next week
[4048.42 --> 4052.42]  because i'm going to be at the new house all the time anyway jake's going to come over we're going
[4052.42 --> 4056.50]  to get the thermal camera out we're going to show where all the in-floor heating zones are which is
[4056.50 --> 4061.94]  going to be super cool uh we are going to show the proof of concept for how the smart dampers are going
[4061.94 --> 4067.54]  to work with honestly a really affordable implementation i'm i'm really excited about it
[4067.54 --> 4076.02]  stefan says joysticks are mechanical why not optical sensors that's a good question i mean it's
[4076.02 --> 4082.34]  been done with devices like a trackball before my concern would be that they might actually drift kind
[4082.34 --> 4088.74]  of like a joystick might um but then if i think you could probably solve that through software making
[4088.74 --> 4094.18]  sure that it kind of re-zeros every time it yeah how would it know to re-zero i don't know interesting
[4094.18 --> 4101.30]  um blake says consoles are sold at a loss they can't do that without the profit from games okay
[4101.30 --> 4107.46]  but you did overlook one small thing this will ship with steam os and valve will get plenty of profit from
[4107.46 --> 4114.18]  the games so i think the reason they wouldn't sell it at a loss is because valve ultimately doesn't care
[4114.18 --> 4118.98]  who makes the hardware they will get their 30 regardless of whether you buy a steam deck or an
[4118.98 --> 4127.46]  a neo or whatever else chris says might be a good price for the engineering but not for what it'll
[4127.46 --> 4132.34]  likely be used for imo which is random cheapo steam games most people who care about steam don't need
[4132.34 --> 4140.66]  a 400 tiny pc at this price so who is this for bad take chris oh you spent 20 to send me such a bad take
[4140.66 --> 4150.34]  yeah you can't you can't you can't tell someone else sort of what like the games that they play are
[4150.34 --> 4158.10]  not they're random and cheapo and therefore not worthy of spending 400 on a device that lets them take
[4158.10 --> 4165.62]  them with them what if they love those games and besides you can play like anything about ps3
[4165.62 --> 4177.46]  wii u and or excuse me we ps3 we and back on this thing that is an immense accessible game library
[4177.46 --> 4183.14]  that's an incredibly difficult statement to even make because you'd have to assess every single
[4183.14 --> 4187.70]  game that you can play on that device in order to make that statement that's really it's gonna be
[4187.70 --> 4195.06]  really hard like honestly i i i love this thing you know we should do a straw poll let's do a straw poll
[4195.06 --> 4207.14]  um here we go so create a poll all right steam deck so we're gonna have a few different statuses
[4207.14 --> 4216.26]  pre-ordered thinking about it probably not never because you know you're feeling that it's not right
[4216.26 --> 4222.74]  for you that's totally valid your admin rights are temporary but you're creating a free account
[4222.74 --> 4229.38]  okay yeah whatever i don't know okay let's send this link so you you have every right to not think
[4229.38 --> 4236.42]  that it's great for you but you can't just assume other people's other people's game preferences and
[4236.42 --> 4243.70]  like what they're passionate about right all right there you go let's get some results up in here ladies
[4243.70 --> 4248.66]  and gentlemen oh that's because that's not the normal straw poll straw poll dot me is the normal
[4248.66 --> 4259.54]  straw poll oops oh well whatever it's working it's probably fine yep so we've got a massive over 70
[4260.18 --> 4267.54]  almost 75 of our audience saying pre-ordered or thinking about it uh okay
[4267.54 --> 4278.90]  those are okay so we're settling in at around 70 those are massive massive numbers massive numbers
[4280.34 --> 4286.34]  so chris you're not into it that's cool a lot of people are a lot of people play a lot of different
[4286.34 --> 4293.62]  kinds of games like hey check this out what's that oh we got what is that mario kart we running on this
[4293.62 --> 4298.66]  thing and to be very clear if you're not into it we're not saying you should be yeah you don't have
[4298.66 --> 4303.70]  to be but if you're if you're the kind of person that you know bought a ds so what's that a couple
[4303.70 --> 4310.82]  hundred bucks so that you could play mario kart on the toilet well this is twice the price okay sure
[4310.82 --> 4319.06]  but has so much more functionality and it can totally do that like this runs basically flawlessly in
[4319.06 --> 4325.06]  dolphin emulator on this thing and this is very similar hardware two more cores but my understanding
[4325.06 --> 4331.94]  is that dolphin emulator doesn't actually take advantage of many cores uh particularly anyway so
[4332.90 --> 4337.94]  got my fps counter up in the corner you guys probably can't see that but it is locked at 60 sort of
[4337.94 --> 4344.26]  actually it dips down to like 58 56 you'll hit 50 during like a loading screen or whatever something
[4344.26 --> 4351.94]  like that but it goes ladies and gentlemen it goes you can see my uh my lights man it gets so bright
[4351.94 --> 4357.78]  here i'm trying to remember the buttons for this whoops there's your problem where's my jump
[4359.62 --> 4363.62]  i could have sworn jump was you know what i might have screwed up my key bindings i have another
[4363.62 --> 4368.58]  emulator open in the background i have a snes emulator open in the background so i think that's
[4368.58 --> 4377.30]  probably the problem and the gap between something like this and a no backlight original game boy um
[4377.94 --> 4382.58]  which i know none of them had backlights i'm just clarifying because that was a big thing the the road
[4382.58 --> 4389.70]  trip experience gap between between the no backlight original game boy and this is just absolutely
[4389.70 --> 4396.98]  incredible oh for sure absolutely for sure bud sorry i'm just going to make sure i don't lose my progress
[4396.98 --> 4403.30]  in super mario rpg make sure i close that properly all right so i was just in the middle of a fight so
[4403.30 --> 4411.14]  i hadn't saved uh oh oh whoa i missed something whoa anthony pointed out the a neo has vega graphics
[4411.14 --> 4419.86]  and the steam deck has rdna2 graphics so uh in terms of gpu i would expect the steam deck to be significantly
[4419.86 --> 4426.58]  more powerful while cpu on the a neo might be a touch better um but we don't know it would only
[4426.58 --> 4432.34]  be for applications that will really take advantage of those extra cores uh mal says the australians got
[4432.34 --> 4436.26]  short changed again there's no way to pre-order here we still haven't gotten the valve index yeah
[4437.14 --> 4441.70]  that's real frustrating i mean i went through that with the index the only way i was able to get it was
[4441.70 --> 4447.22]  by having uh john our writer for tech quickie order it and then ship it to me and then when i had a
[4447.22 --> 4451.70]  problem with it valve gave me a really hard time about the fact that i was canadian and i had a
[4451.70 --> 4460.18]  u.s product um profits business guru says i think some people don't appreciate the value of good
[4460.18 --> 4467.38]  hardware good stuff costs money yeah 100 totally does valve says the biggest thing is the deck
[4467.38 --> 4470.58]  allows for third-party apps so if you install retro arch you'll have one of the best portable
[4470.58 --> 4476.42]  emulation rigs money can buy that's where the value is for me yeah 100 100 100 uh psp
[4476.42 --> 4485.14]  one so says thoughts on the 1280 by 860 hertz yeah yeah i love 16 by 10 just like you but i wish
[4485.14 --> 4489.62]  that it was at least possible to unlock a higher refresh rate even if it does kind of crush the
[4489.62 --> 4498.90]  battery uh cross co's says imagine saying steam deck with an aussie accent okay that cost 20 australian
[4498.90 --> 4503.14]  dollars to send me that message uh presley says i know you don't actually do super chats but i'm
[4503.14 --> 4506.50]  always working during the show so i never get to watch live but it's always the highlight of my
[4506.50 --> 4511.14]  night slash end of week after work just wanted to say thanks lttstore.com hey thanks presley
[4511.70 --> 4517.54]  appreciate you fam joey says should i buy it right away or wait like a year until it's proven to be
[4517.54 --> 4523.54]  really good slash bad well if you wait a year valve might have just discontinued it so
[4524.82 --> 4530.58]  uh just saying that's very true just saying that's a very good you want to buy a steam link
[4530.58 --> 4534.42]  son you want to buy uh you want to buy a steam controller
[4536.50 --> 4542.50]  uh one thing i will give them credit for it will still work that's fair that's true they they did
[4542.50 --> 4549.62]  they did do that thing uh is julia melb why did you build an alternate video platform called floatplane
[4549.62 --> 4553.38]  then neglect to put the android app on alternate app stores like fdroid
[4553.38 --> 4560.66]  i confess it had never occurred to me to put it on there why wouldn't you just get it on the google
[4560.66 --> 4569.62]  play store am i missing something i mean you could just side literally never had that request yep yep
[4569.62 --> 4582.02]  right yep i mean you could just go to uh what's one of the trusted apk sites is apk pure okay
[4584.42 --> 4590.02]  i don't know the point is just go find a trusted apk site i'm sure like xda developers can help guide
[4590.02 --> 4597.46]  you there and download the apk and sideload it hey that's android for you right um yeah
[4599.54 --> 4604.42]  i am very excited about sideloading apps in windows 11 directly instead of having to use some
[4604.42 --> 4610.10]  emulator stuff but that's a totally different thing this is great edward bratton says how it started
[4610.10 --> 4616.26]  bitcoin 62 000 how it's going now please buy these chinese gpus we threw on the floor
[4616.26 --> 4623.06]  yeah pretty much uh vince asked will you be doing separate videos for each room upgrade of your new
[4623.06 --> 4629.38]  house or will you just do another house tour once it's all done there will be videos the next one is
[4629.38 --> 4634.26]  going to be me and jake going through proof of concept for the hvac i'm trying to get like water
[4634.26 --> 4640.66]  cooled solar panels there will be a video about that if i pull it off um i want to do obvious probably a
[4640.66 --> 4646.02]  couple videos about the home theater like i'm going to be milking it for content because it's something
[4646.02 --> 4650.98]  that i'm going to be spending a lot of my time on over the coming months anyway so i might as well
[4650.98 --> 4655.70]  be making videos about it and it's also an opportunity to explore tech that i otherwise
[4655.70 --> 4660.02]  wouldn't really have access to we can't get samples of everything so if i'm buying stuff i'm definitely
[4660.02 --> 4667.06]  going to want to get more value out of it and make a video out of it um all right js2k says any chance
[4667.06 --> 4672.34]  we might see more ltt crew faces in main ltd videos maybe i'm forgetting appearances but lately i'm kind
[4672.34 --> 4677.30]  of missing riley james madison sarah etc uh well i was on vacation last week and i'm on vacation again
[4677.30 --> 4682.02]  this coming week so definitely some videos got shot without me you just got to wait for them to
[4682.02 --> 4686.98]  show up also if you're on flow plane you'll get exclusive behind the scenes interviews with people
[4686.98 --> 4694.66]  and all that kind of stuff as well uh peter says the steam deck price is amazing though if any company
[4694.66 --> 4698.90]  could slash would take a big hit on the cost it would be valve since they still take their 20 to 30
[4698.90 --> 4706.26]  absolutely other pc makers do not have that luxury all right i think that is pretty much it for the
[4706.26 --> 4713.14]  show today thank you so much just to make a quick comment on that one you see fairly often consoles
[4713.14 --> 4717.46]  take a pricing hit because they want to make money on peripherals they want to make money on game sales
[4717.46 --> 4722.90]  they want to make money on whatever else um but that's kind of tough to do like elinus just said
[4722.90 --> 4728.98]  with traditional pc sales because they don't have the ability to do those things uh so they need to
[4728.98 --> 4734.58]  make their money off the original sale they gaben trying to be really price competitive on this is
[4734.58 --> 4740.10]  probably because what linus is saying earlier um this is going to make it very valuable for certain
[4740.10 --> 4745.54]  people to play certain games um and and someone brought up in float plane chat right after linus said
[4745.54 --> 4751.54]  that that an extremely common purchase for people that bought a switch were games they've played before
[4751.54 --> 4757.38]  yeah they just bought a cartridge for the switch and if you don't own a certain game on steam because
[4757.38 --> 4761.62]  you're not going to play it at your desktop this will very likely drive sales for those types of
[4761.62 --> 4767.06]  oh for sure for sure i will they are going to get value out of this after it's sold is what i'm trying
[4767.06 --> 4771.86]  to say i will buy games that i otherwise wouldn't have bought on steam like there's uh there's a
[4771.86 --> 4778.74]  final fantasy 6 and 5 remake coming that honestly i'm just i'm not going to sit on my couch at my tv
[4778.74 --> 4784.42]  or at my desktop and play those games it's just not going to happen on here whole other ball of
[4784.42 --> 4791.94]  wax yeah whole other ball of wax definitely all right thanks for tuning into the show this week
[4791.94 --> 4800.58]  ladies and gentlemen we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[4808.74 --> 4826.50]  you
