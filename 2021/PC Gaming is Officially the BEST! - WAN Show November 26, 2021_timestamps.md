This is actually quite entertaining to listen to you guys talk about a bunch of random stuff.

It's not super easy for me to spend about 2 hours to listen to the entire WAN show (usually takes me about 4 days to listen to a whole WAN show), but you guys definitely cover a lot more than what's timestamped.

(e.g. your business philosophy/practices, etc.)

It's interesting to listen to that.

Ah yes time to buy a pre-built PC with a Geforce 8400 GT for my child; a higher model number than the RTX 3090 so it MUST be twice as good!
