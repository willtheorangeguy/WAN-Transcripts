[0.00 → 9.00] welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today of
[9.00 → 16.90] course the big news this week was Apple making the very undappled move of creating a self-service
[16.90 → 23.48] repair program in the most Apple possible way because there was a gun to their head and their
[23.48 → 29.10] arm twisted behind their back gotta freaking love it in other big controversial news
[29.10 → 38.74] Streamlabs which is now Streamlabs not Streamlabs OBS has been involved in a public TIFF with the
[38.74 → 44.96] makers of OBS or open broadcast and others open broadcaster software that's what it's short
[44.96 → 49.52] for right I think it's just broad system or is it system software I think what's the s for
[49.52 → 55.50] oh wow this is embarrassing yeah oh broadcaster yeah your right open broadcaster software there
[55.50 → 63.18] we go all right what else we got this week NFT Bay uh a pirate bay for NFTs wait are you serious
[63.18 → 68.74] it's a pirated NFT okay we'll talk about that wait you didn't know no I hadn't thought you don't know
[68.74 → 73.98] about right click save as oh my goodness I mean I know what right click save as is anyway okay anyway
[73.98 → 78.14] the next thing NFT Bay there's like 20 terabytes of it it's its interesting we'll talk about that later
[78.14 → 84.80] also I'm going to jump to this just because this I'm actually very happy this is happening which
[84.80 → 91.12] might make me sound horrible but uh the fall of Activision slash Blizzard Bobby Ko tick is the worst
[91.12 → 96.80] of the bunch I tried to go out on a bit of a limb a while ago and call it Bobby Ko tick on Sancho because
[96.80 → 104.10] like I felt like no one else was, and now it's happening, and I feel validated it's good it's
[104.10 → 109.70] good he's finally he's finally taken the sword um yeah he's like a horrible person, but we'll talk
[109.70 → 110.14] about that later
[110.14 → 133.28] and the show is brought to you by ATER Squarespace
[133.28 → 135.94] and Secret Lab
[135.94 → 140.72] all right there are a couple of merch messages that are amazing I just need to get to these really quick
[140.72 → 148.32] uh oh wait where oh where'd it go um uh okay this is great how do I open the bicep pocket on the
[148.32 → 151.58] WAN hoodie while wearing it can you demo all right ready
[151.58 → 154.88] there you go
[154.88 → 160.66] that's honestly how I've done it there's actually a lot of feedback about how a lot of the pockets on
[160.66 → 163.32] the WAN hoodie v2 are kind of pointless
[163.32 → 170.78] that's fair we know actually but if you find a point for it and someone sees you actually use it
[170.78 → 176.84] it's super sick so every time it's just one of those things where we did it because the original
[176.84 → 182.12] one had a lot of pointless pockets too, and we were like apparently people like that so here we go boys
[182.12 → 190.12] um do it again all right let's go ahead and jump into our first topic today of course it's Apple's
[190.12 → 195.74] self-service repair program or as we're calling it USER program
[195.74 → 204.50] they announced it on Wednesday and this is a huge deal because Apple has famously made like not
[204.50 → 212.10] just not just passively not by accident Apple has famously intentionally made their devices more
[212.10 → 220.08] difficult to repair in recent years for end users for non-authorized repair shops I mean they even
[220.08 → 226.38] refused to repair our Mac Pro which there is a lot of confusion over what happened with that saga
[226.38 → 234.16] the number of people that have read incorrect reports of what happened and assumed that we were
[234.16 → 241.86] somehow looking for some kind of handout is mind-blowing they wanted to pay for it, we broke it and we
[241.86 → 252.42] said hey mea culpa we want you to fix it we will pay you they refused they would not do it that is
[252.42 → 258.68] unacceptable for any company that's ridiculous you don't want like e-waste garbage in the world like
[258.68 → 264.14] that that's the like they wanted to pay for it, we were ready to pay for it so
[264.14 → 270.74] um at that time Apple required a service ticket in order to order a part penalizing or even
[270.74 → 276.28] blacklisting Apple authorized service providers who don't send the broken parts back to them
[276.28 → 283.40] so what happened was not only would Apple not repair it for us, we couldn't get anyone else to do it for
[283.40 → 290.36] us because and this was rectified later they did eventually approve a replacement, but the cost was
[290.36 → 298.62] ridiculous because to Apple a motherboard is apparently the motherboard CPU RAM which is stupid
[298.62 → 303.86] obviously yeah anyway we did eventually get that sorted out we ended up doing it ourselves anyway
[303.86 → 308.68] because it wasn't cost-effective, but they required a service ticket because once our uh once our serial
[308.68 → 312.94] number was flagged in the system nobody could order a board for us because they would have to send
[312.94 → 318.76] back our serial number like they'd have to send back the board and then Apple is like uh, uh no
[318.76 → 325.60] like the amount of control that they exercise over this stuff is just unbelievable so what this does
[325.60 → 331.56] is it keeps these broken parts off the gray market for independent repair and allows Apple's own repair
[331.56 → 336.92] service to enjoy an advantage in repair in part access over even their Apple authorized service providers
[336.92 → 343.52] so the TLDR Apple has fought independent repair at every turn for at least a decade but this self-service
[343.52 → 350.22] repair program or USER is uh going to support the iPhone 12 and 13 to begin with and will offer
[350.22 → 357.86] apparently more than 200 individual parts and tools including display assemblies camera modules batteries
[357.86 → 364.06] and then of course the tools that are required to make the repairs it will be only available in the United
[364.06 → 371.50] States to start in early 2022 but will expand to additional countries throughout 2022 uh support
[371.50 → 382.64] for additional repairs and M1 Max will come later in 2022 so your thoughts uh honestly when I read this
[382.64 → 391.42] and I still kind of feel this way yeah I'm just waiting till I see it yeah I think that's fair enough
[391.42 → 398.66] I think there's a hundred ways that Apple can make this not make any sense even just pricing yeah if
[398.66 → 404.90] the pricing doesn't make any sense because Apple forces you to buy let's say let's say not only the
[404.90 → 411.62] screen but also all the tools required even if you already own them there's also like right now we're
[411.62 → 417.46] in a chip shortage right so are they going to prioritize this right, so availability will they
[417.46 → 422.38] even have stock is it just going to be permanently out of stock and overpriced like I don't know maybe it
[422.38 → 426.64] won't be I'd love to give them benefit of the doubt I think that's kind of where I'm sitting right now I
[426.64 → 430.98] think this is very cool I'm happy they're stepping in this direction at all because even if it's ineffective
[430.98 → 437.94] maybe it gets some more people to start embracing this type of stuff but is Apple moving in this direction or are
[437.94 → 443.70] they're just trying to appease they've been pushed in this direction well either way honestly I don't care as long as
[443.70 → 449.94] there's more right to repair stuff going on it's been pointed out that Wednesday happened to be this is probably a
[449.94 → 456.94] coincidence though happens to be the deadline for Apple to take action on a pro repair shareholder resolution filed by
[456.94 → 463.94] environmental activists' oh Apple could have faced SEC enforcement had they not complied
[463.94 → 470.94] okay yeah like I'm sure they didn't want to do this that that's the kind of vibe I've been getting this whole time
[470.94 → 481.94] um the irony or not irony the hypocrisy of all of this is that Apple beats this drum, and I've been I've been criticized uh very
[481.94 → 489.94] uh very recently I was criticized for not pointing out HP's uh excellent access to service manuals and parts which I
[489.94 → 495.94] actually did do in a recent video, but that was not the only thing that particular critic got wrong about um things that I
[495.94 → 503.94] have or haven't said um I was criticized for not pointing out HP's uh excellent moves, and I've also been criticized
[503.94 → 511.94] for not pointing out that there are plenty of other companies that don't do any better of a job than Apple they might not go as
[511.94 → 518.94] far uh to prevent users from repairing their devices but certainly don't go out of their way to help with it
[518.94 → 523.94] yeah and the reason for that is that it's Apple's hypocrisy that makes them such a target for me
[523.94 → 533.94] they keep talking about green carbon-neutral environment blah blah blah they have an entire they have an entire website
[533.94 → 540.94] like sub site dedicated to how environmentally friendly they are, and they use it as a selling point for moving
[540.94 → 548.94] for moves that are frankly blatantly obviously just about saving cost like not including chargers with their phones
[548.94 → 557.94] um there happens to be an environmental benefit which is great out a w is a w for sure yes but don't pretend
[557.94 → 564.94] that that's why you did it because whenever it is inconvenient whenever it is not profitable even in some cases when it would be
[564.94 → 572.94] profitable for them to just make these parts accessible Apple actively fights against people repairing their own devices
[572.94 → 580.94] and especially small shops repairing Apple devices without Apple's blessing and that is environmentally devastating
[580.94 → 588.94] throwing away shredding working devices even in some cases working devices that still are getting software updates like we're not even talking
[588.94 → 596.94] stuff that would be a security risk to be on any network or anything like that we're talking working actively supporting devices
[596.94 → 606.94] supporting devices shredding those there is absolutely no way to spin that into some kind of environmental positive and the Apple apologists will say
[606.94 → 614.94] well um actually Linus Apple recycles a lot of stuff good for them that's good I'm not going to criticize them for that
[614.94 → 624.94] what I'm criticizing them for is resorting to the worst R when the first two R's were absolutely accessible in many cases
[624.94 → 632.94] that's why I'm critical reduce reuse, but repair should probably be in there to reduce recycle
[632.94 → 642.94] isn't repair and reduce kind of yeah sure I'm repairing is a means to reduction yes so that is the first R the best R
[642.94 → 654.94] um so like so yeah I don't know I I I will see in the future I suspect it's kind of a not entirely fully real move, but we'll see
[654.94 → 661.94] yeah I mean Apple still has an opportunity here to completely blow us away and yes, and I would love that that would be great
[661.94 → 669.94] make a very open to it even if it wasn't the full you know transparency that we might want that that someone
[669.94 → 677.94] like a Grossman might want right where Apple's providing literal schematics and part number ordering part
[677.94 → 685.94] numbers for every capacitor on the board right like even if they don't go that far I'd say the vast majority
[685.94 → 691.94] of dead iPhones that you just want a quick and easy repair at your local shop in the mall or whatever
[691.94 → 697.94] are going to be your broken screens your broken lightning connectors right though those like a button that
[697.94 → 703.94] doesn't work as long as that basic stuff is covered battery replacements these are batteries are consumables
[703.94 → 709.94] even rechargeable batteries they're consumables yeah um as long as you've got all those major bases covered
[709.94 → 717.94] I would consider this a win for consumers uh obviously Apple could take it a step farther, and they could just
[717.94 → 723.94] you know uh no I don't think I would even ask for that, so I'm not going to bring it up I'm not going to bring it up I
[723.94 → 731.94] want to make sure that I'm being reasonable okay uh now speaking of Grossman uh Lewis Grossman did respond uh with
[731.94 → 739.94] mild skepticism especially after Apple's independent repair provider program in 2019 yeah um required
[739.94 → 745.94] independent repair shops to agree to replace entire assemblies even if the faulty component itself should
[745.94 → 751.94] cost significantly less he's been on this ride before as little as sixty dollars versus three hundred dollars so a
[751.94 → 757.94] keyboard issue for example gee were keyboard issues a problem for Apple in 2019 was that a common thing just a
[757.94 → 762.74] little bit I think I don't think anyone almost all of them I think I don't think anyone needed their
[762.74 → 767.70] keyboard replaced on a MacBook in 2019 nah that doesn't ring a bell nah, so a keyboard issue would
[767.70 → 772.10] actually require the replacement of the entire upper chassis including the trackpad battery speakers
[772.10 → 778.50] microphones and of course the shell itself I mean that's ridiculous but in order to become one of
[778.50 → 784.10] these uh repair providers you had to agree to perform the repairs like that and if you're found in
[784.10 → 790.50] violation uh there can be penalties so that's not that's not really providing options that's just
[790.50 → 796.74] making the independent repair shop uncompetitive right like forcing them to charge three hundred dollars for
[796.74 → 802.58] a sixty dollar repair is not reasonable um, so Lewis called on Apple to sell individual parts and not make
[802.58 → 809.06] this a meme like the independent repair program and uh if Apple takes it seriously has said he will
[809.06 → 813.86] swallow everything he said about them and move forward working together no grudges nice
[813.86 → 820.10] I believe that I believe that um I think that I think that Lewis absolutely can get very angry
[820.10 → 826.50] about things, but I also think that he's a reasonable person who can get unangry as quickly as he gets
[826.50 → 831.46] angry as long as you're doing it the way that he thinks it should be done which by and large he tends
[831.46 → 835.86] to be right about I would also say that in a lot of cases when he is furious about something
[835.86 → 842.26] we need someone like him to be angry about it, and it's very helpful to have him being angry about it
[842.26 → 848.26] maybe not fantastic for like mental health reasons stuff being constantly angry um but like we need
[848.26 → 853.78] someone fighting to fight he will live a shorter life on account of that uh and I hate that because
[853.78 → 860.50] you know love the guy um but yeah like it's its very good to have someone fighting that fight
[860.50 → 868.50] so someone asked um if there could be digital gift cards on the LTT store there are um maybe you
[868.50 → 872.50] need to work on the searchability on LTT store a little bit well there's physical gift cards but
[872.50 → 879.86] are they digital ones oh we mail people those gift cards oh I actually don't know do we just assumed
[879.86 → 886.66] they would be digital because it's like no I think they're physical wow Sarah did up late graphics for the cards
[886.66 → 898.18] wow yeah okay um maybe we'll make digital ones I'll talk to Nick um oh I love it all right um so the
[898.18 → 901.78] question the reason why they asked that which is actually kind of interesting is they're saying for
[901.78 → 907.30] for like Christmas presents yeah Conrad said they're digital he said they're digital okay I don't know I
[907.30 → 912.18] don't know yes they're digital um so the reason why they asked that was because they can gift people
[912.18 → 918.18] in uh they're all digital overseas countries okay gift cards for Christmas and stuff because a lot of
[918.18 → 922.82] these people like bundling their purchases because of shipment costs sure they are digital sorry cool
[922.82 → 928.26] I was completely mistaken so Sarah just the graphics are great yeah they're they're actually
[928.26 → 932.66] super cool and I like that there's individual ones for the different values of gift card that you can
[932.66 → 940.58] buy and stuff but uh Tom Arnold made the intro where I come out of a box all right let's move on to our
[940.58 → 945.70] next topic I mean I guess that's all there is to really say oh actually no there is a discussion
[945.70 → 951.54] topic here that Anthony put in for us would repairability make you more likely to purchase
[951.54 → 959.70] Apple products in the future there's you personally I mean you've even considered going iPhone in the
[959.70 → 967.30] last in the last calendar yeah I had to pause talk about it yeah um it I don't I don't know if it
[967.30 → 971.38] would make me buy them, but the question was technically more likely would it make you more
[971.38 → 977.14] likely would make me more likely to buy it I still don't know if that would result in me buying it
[977.86 → 983.38] but it Is mean it is makes the situation a lot better like I'm I'm trying to value
[983.38 → 988.82] repairability quite highly in future purchases right now and there are a few phones on the market
[988.82 → 993.78] that look like they have considerable repairability but the main one that I'm interested in is overseas
[993.78 → 998.74] only Europe only I believe right um so that's a little unfortunate blah blah blah uh but like
[998.74 → 1003.30] that's kind of that is a big solid point for me specifically right now so yeah it would make me
[1003.30 → 1009.38] more likely Apple already does a great job on sustainability from a software perspective they
[1009.38 → 1015.62] support their hardware longer than almost it than anyone else there's very old iPhone in the mobile
[1015.62 → 1021.46] phone space taking it yeah the iPhone SE is still getting software updates yeah so all they have to do is
[1021.46 → 1027.62] do the hardware too and then yeah that would make me more likely, but it would also have to be part of
[1027.62 → 1036.02] an overall attitude shift towards um not assuming how I want to do things right um yeah I can quickly
[1036.02 → 1043.54] find phone apps by the way because I have like a template for my folders and I just use muscle memory
[1043.54 → 1047.38] I know exactly where everything is, and I've been using exactly the same layout for many years
[1047.38 → 1053.62] um apparently one of uh one of our viewers their favourite WAN show is the one from Japan
[1054.26 → 1062.18] man it has been a long time that was a heck of a show that was something else oh man yeah that was
[1062.18 → 1067.78] amazing I the uh the camera setup for that will be something that I will never forget in my whole life
[1067.78 → 1074.58] I am going oh just the fact that Easel passed out drunk, and we all forgot we were supposed to do WAN yeah
[1074.58 → 1082.58] so like I yeah so he was like not able to really not function stay upright, but he got the camera going
[1082.58 → 1087.78] yeah and like sort of monitored it and everything it was like it was actually pretty impressive
[1087.78 → 1094.10] considering the degree of inebriation yeah um yeah so that's pretty cool
[1095.94 → 1103.38] I can keep watching the forum I'm finally travelling again I am going on my first trip in I mean technically I
[1103.38 → 1110.58] guess I went down to Seattle to visit valve to check out the early steam deck uh man they keep
[1110.58 → 1115.46] kind of emailing me I was like keep me in the loop keep me in the loop, and they're doing that and every
[1115.46 → 1120.74] time I see an email from my valve rep I'm like is this the one is this the one where I'm getting my
[1120.74 → 1126.74] unit and I can start to make videos about it because I have so many questions to answer still I'm so excited
[1126.74 → 1132.10] uh did you see in their developer event that they um they formalized because I think this was either
[1132.10 → 1136.98] rumoured or expected at some point, but they formalized that steam OS 3.0 is going to be a
[1136.98 → 1143.54] standalone Linux distro oh so you can just wow yeah okay, okay I've actually been wondering about that
[1143.54 → 1148.98] that's pretty interesting all the benefits genuinely pretty interesting the literal millions of dollars
[1148.98 → 1155.30] that valve will have put into game compatibility in Linux like is that episode six I think we jumped the
[1155.30 → 1161.06] gun I think we jumped the gun on the Linux gaming challenge because steam OS 3.0 could potentially
[1161.94 → 1168.18] just well I still think it was valuable for us to see where we started before yes yeah but once it
[1168.18 → 1173.30] happens I mean there's the potential that we could kind of go okay lets Linux challenge again I'd try it
[1173.30 → 1180.74] again I would, I'll try it again in a bit my kids were pretty stoked well now that don't necessarily know
[1180.74 → 1190.50] if we need to like cold turkey it again I for me because I'm so convenience oriented like I talked
[1190.50 → 1195.86] about this in some of the other parts I have more free time and other in other parts like when I have
[1195.86 → 1203.06] 45 minutes to sit in game I need less than two minutes of it to be launching the game we haven't
[1203.06 → 1209.38] yeah we haven't played Anna or Forge Alliance for like a month and a half I actually kind of cheated on you
[1209.38 → 1217.94] um the night that you messaged me about playing subcom I didn't get your message because I was like
[1218.66 → 1225.30] vibing playing Anna for like three hours oh that's actually pretty chill yeah I was uh I was definitely
[1225.30 → 1233.94] I was definitely just I couldn't sleep, and I was I was like oh, thank goodness I have because honestly
[1233.94 → 1240.18] that's one of the things that I'll do is when I'm tired but not sleepy I'll sit, and I'll play a game
[1240.18 → 1246.26] that um Anna's not what I have been going for because Anna was a bit of a problem for me for a
[1246.26 → 1251.62] bit where I'd sit down to play for an hour, and I was just time's just gone six hours later the game
[1251.62 → 1257.14] even tells you every two hours it'll be like hey you should probably get up and stretch your legs or get
[1257.14 → 1263.62] a cup of coffee in a while yeah um so it wasn't Anna for a bit um so not having cave story because
[1263.62 → 1267.62] that's what I was actually playing late at night yeah I'm not having my save game when I started the
[1267.62 → 1273.14] Linux challenge is really, really frustrating for me but uh that's something that I'll do when I'm tired
[1273.14 → 1279.22] but not sleepy, so I was I couldn't sleep, so I was just like okay I'm just going to let myself get tired so
[1279.22 → 1283.38] I like fixed a couple of supply chain issues, and then I was able to go to bed, and I was able to sleep
[1283.38 → 1290.42] um I forget where I was going with this story but yes I cheated on you, I'm sorry that's all right
[1290.42 → 1295.62] it's its good to be back on Windows for a bit I would like to just I'd like to just stay on Windows
[1295.62 → 1301.30] for a little bit like almost exclusively been playing games that don't work on Linux yeah just
[1301.30 → 1308.34] to like okay I'm back um what was I going to say but yeah I in some capacity I would genuinely really like
[1308.34 → 1312.50] to try it yeah and like even if we weren't doing an official challenge I would probably
[1313.38 → 1319.14] format that drive and give it a shot um it's very interesting I'm stoked so man once it
[1319.14 → 1324.74] comes there 's's so many questions for me to answer I'm really excited um speaking of people who
[1324.74 → 1328.98] are excited Nick's been standing here going like this like wanting to talk to you all they
[1328.98 → 1332.98] won't be able to hear you on these mics because they're super all right all right all right
[1332.98 → 1340.50] I know about the physical gift cards we dealt with it geez everyone's riding me here well I
[1340.50 → 1348.02] don't know physical gift cards there Conrad knew and told us like right away yeah okay all right
[1348.02 → 1354.82] it's its the filters is what I'm talking about yeah, thanks Nick um I would recommend uh machine
[1354.82 → 1361.54] washing cold and then uh laying it out to dry for the desk pad cleaning there you go all right
[1361.54 → 1369.62] why don't we move on to our next topic here the stream labs controversy yeah so I have to confess that
[1369.62 → 1379.70] even as someone who sort of pays attention to the streaming and technology space I assumed which
[1379.70 → 1387.94] I see now I shouldn't have I assumed that stream labs obs as it used to be called was somehow associated
[1387.94 → 1396.18] with obs I knew that stream labs obs is like junk, and you shouldn't use it, so I'd never really um
[1396.18 → 1401.54] um I'd never really gotten into or not junk what I had heard about it was that it's more basic
[1402.10 → 1408.90] like it's supposed to be streamlined as opposed to fully featured so for my part I was like well I
[1408.90 → 1413.86] think I can figure out how to use obs, so I'm not going to use the stream labs obs, but I could see how
[1413.86 → 1418.66] there's a value to something like this existing, but I thought that they were just kind of like
[1418.66 → 1428.90] different streams of somehow associated projects, but that's that's not what it was not so what
[1428.90 → 1436.10] is the deal here uh I they're they're essentially just trying to own the entire software space for
[1436.10 → 1440.50] for streaming um as far as my understanding goes they've been trying to do this for a long time
[1440.50 → 1448.42] uh I have been frustrated with stream labs for a considerable amount of time because they don't
[1448.42 → 1453.94] remember because it's been genuinely a very long time yeah, but there was a service that I used to use
[1454.34 → 1458.66] that disappeared, and I don't know if they disappeared because they're like ah not enough people are using
[1458.66 → 1464.26] us now because of stream labs or if it's because they got like bought out or copied or what happened
[1464.26 → 1468.90] but I know they disappeared, and I was frustrated because I didn't like the way that stream labs worked
[1468.90 → 1473.62] right and I wanted to be able to use my old thing still and there was some issue with that, but it's
[1473.62 → 1477.22] it's genuinely been like six years or something, so I don't remember the details and I don't want to
[1477.22 → 1483.46] claim anything because it could be wrong um but yeah and then there's than there's stream labs obs which I
[1483.46 → 1490.02] have exclusively called slobs because I don't like stream labs and I find slobs to be hilarious um
[1490.02 → 1495.94] okay fair enough uh and then now this is coming out and yeah it's its annoying and a lot of their
[1495.94 → 1501.94] business practices for a long time have been very frustrating um it's its not just obs it's its a
[1501.94 → 1506.50] slew of other companies light stream had a really, really interesting comparison that they showed
[1506.50 → 1513.06] where one of light streams like front page where they show off um their features and stuff is
[1513.06 → 1516.18] practically you probably have to click on the image for people to be able to see it, but it's
[1516.18 → 1523.94] practically identical to the page that stream labs put up including the reviews right which is just like
[1523.94 → 1530.10] what stream lab said that apparently that was uh a test page for internal use that was not meant to
[1530.10 → 1538.02] be published which is still like dude you shouldn't just copy and paste things including reviews for
[1538.90 → 1544.58] like an internal test site just make your own thing just use lorem ipsum like everybody else yeah
[1544.58 → 1550.90] like come on layers on your overlays automatically whenever you go live layers on your overlay wow it's
[1550.90 → 1556.58] like word for word there are a few things you can find like there's a few ways that they say something
[1556.58 → 1561.30] that is exactly different every time throughout the whole web page and stuff like, but it's its quite
[1561.30 → 1570.10] egregious it's its gross I don't know bad not cool business practices um copying stealing
[1570.10 → 1574.58] overriding stuff like that so with stream labs obs one of the problems that i I don't think ended up
[1574.58 → 1580.82] showing up in here yeah is by having obs in their name and then buying advertising space for the
[1581.78 → 1588.34] keyword of obs right searching in google uh when people would search for obs let's see if it happens
[1588.34 → 1594.34] now after the controversy no it doesn't uh but for a long time or in the past or whatever you want to
[1594.34 → 1600.18] say it um if you search obs it would come up with Streamlabs obs right um which is kind of blah
[1601.86 → 1605.94] so I mean apparently I'm not the only one that was confused and thought there was some kind of
[1606.50 → 1612.74] association between the projects, but that was like kind of the whole problem yeah yeah and I mean
[1612.74 → 1620.82] stream obs is open source yeah like so technically someone else can utilize that code they can utilize
[1620.82 → 1626.50] the code base the name is a little the name is pretty freaking iffy yeah, so the controversy led obs
[1626.50 → 1630.90] developers to share their own woes uh when Streamlabs was developing they were approached, or they were
[1630.90 → 1638.26] uh they were approached about by Streamlabs about the use of obs in their name obs declined but
[1638.26 → 1645.30] Streamlabs went ahead and not only used the name but filed a trademark too very cool which is a super
[1645.30 → 1651.70] dick move as it's as it's called in the industry uh prominent streamers like Havana and Pokémon
[1651.70 → 1655.86] spoke out saying that they would no longer use or be affiliated with Streamlabs if they didn't resolve the
[1655.86 → 1661.94] issue why do they use Streamlabs aren't they like professional streamers' no Streamlabs like is
[1661.94 → 1668.26] like a lot of people use it they do yeah why I don't I I believe the alerts and stuff the integrations
[1668.26 → 1672.90] of those things are like easier or something I hate it I don't know I hate it because I'm not used to it
[1672.90 → 1678.50] to be fair right okay can I mean float plane chat like is there a reason to use Streamlabs if you're a
[1678.50 → 1685.54] new streamer ever like no okay not everyone I bet you EPOS is watching, and he's like I don't and I'm
[1685.54 → 1692.50] the I'm the streaming technician guy um, but there's a lot of people online that will recommend you just
[1692.50 → 1697.38] go to Streamlabs because I believe it's kind of a one-stop shop it gets everything going blah blah blah
[1697.38 → 1704.26] right okay yeah um convenience I mean I guess for my part like a lot of the time I will just I mean
[1704.26 → 1710.58] I went Manjaro right like a lot of the time I'll just be like we also we already used this and we
[1710.58 → 1717.86] don't use a lot of the alerts that normal streamers use oh I guess that's fair like we made our own
[1717.86 → 1725.14] merch thing right which like wouldn't work with it anyway right okay so I mean no it works with
[1725.14 → 1729.86] slobs I just don't think it would work with the Streamlabs alerts I just mean my general philosophy is
[1729.86 → 1733.94] if I'm going to have to learn the hard one eventually anyway you just go I might as well just do it now
[1733.94 → 1739.22] like it's kind of you know how you know it's like learning physics right where every year you find
[1739.22 → 1745.38] out that everything you learned that last year was wrong yeah yeah I could go into a few
[1745.38 → 1749.86] stories about that but yes that's absolutely true like what's the point right I might as well just go
[1749.86 → 1757.22] hard mode now yeah yeah because you're learning how to learn but yeah yeah exactly um so, so okay yeah
[1757.22 → 1763.06] fine I guess uh professional streamers use Streamlabs obs uh now there's a discussion point here
[1763.94 → 1773.78] is I wonder how NCI felt when you stole the tech tips I stole nothing I stole nothing calling it Linus
[1773.78 → 1782.42] tech tips was actually the CEO of NCI's idea and I bought the Linus tech tips channel and trademark and
[1782.42 → 1792.10] domain okay I paid a fair price of one dollar Canadian it's a canadian dollar it's extremely
[1792.10 → 1799.86] expensive channel um now this is interesting this is an interesting talking point Streamlabs obs has been
[1799.86 → 1805.62] out for almost three years now is obs in the right for airing their dirty laundry now well apparently
[1805.62 → 1811.86] behind the scenes they've been doing so for quite a long time uh they did say no to using the
[1811.86 → 1819.86] name initially um and and and this happens a lot in modern society actually where there will be
[1819.86 → 1826.66] grievances kind of with quite a few people and then one group or one person you'll stand up very loudly
[1826.66 → 1832.50] and then all the other voices will join them right so i I mean it's its fairly standard at this point
[1832.50 → 1836.90] so apparently it's been ongoing EPOS fox has a good video on the subject so you guys can go
[1836.90 → 1842.82] check that out check uh I'm stunned that EPOS fox has a video on a streaming subject

[1994.26 → 1996.18] what is this well I would like you to guess
[2000.42 → 2007.38] it would please me if you would guess it's not very heavy my first is it a phone no it is not a
[2007.38 → 2012.66] phone it's not a phone my first guess was that it was like some weird sandal thing or something
[2012.66 → 2016.90] no it's not a single thing that's incorrect can I cheat at all can I like to read the back
[2016.90 → 2031.30] sure go ahead that doesn't help I think almost at all earphones headphones or earbuds like earbuds what
[2032.50 → 2039.86] made in 2019 why do you have these so um i only recently became aware of these
[2039.86 → 2050.58] Louis Vuitton apparently has a true wireless earphone line um that appears to be their own
[2050.58 → 2055.86] product as opposed to just really silk-screening my logo genuinely astounding onto something else
[2055.86 → 2063.54] well I mean it could be very OEM and just yeah you know branded because i I thought it was going
[2063.54 → 2069.78] to be like you know the like designed by McLaren phone no, no this is actually the
[2069.78 → 2081.46] the one you know what could possibly what could possibly justify
[2082.74 → 2090.98] the whole no dean hundred dollars oh for wireless earphones wow what could possibly justify it
[2090.98 → 2100.50] they don't even look good well that's subjective that's fair I mean they might look good to people
[2100.50 → 2108.90] who care more about the logo than the actual industrial design yeah yeah so guys uh I'm really
[2108.90 → 2113.06] looking forward to reviewing these I'm actually planning to work on my review I'm going to be stuck
[2113.06 → 2119.70] on a plane for 20 hours so I'll have plenty of time to run through the battery and make sure that it's
[2119.70 → 2125.22] actually you know as long as they say it is and uh listen to them is that unopened yeah
[2126.34 → 2130.10] do you want me to open it kind of are you going to do a short circuit should we open it no I'm not
[2130.10 → 2133.94] going to do a short circuit I'm planning a full LTT review yeah then let's do it okay all right you
[2133.94 → 2139.14] guys want you got one a live unboxing of the I'm sure yeah your football I mean first we're going to
[2139.14 → 2145.14] have to we're going to have to experience other aspects of the of like the paper falling out yeah hold on a
[2145.14 → 2149.94] second there's an I thought there was a little uh oh I might have actually misplaced part of the
[2150.66 → 2157.30] part of the experience drama ah tension yeah there's a little there's a little envelope that
[2157.30 → 2162.66] it came with and I honestly have no idea what was in it no, no it's not this it's not this it was a
[2162.66 → 2168.98] little sealed envelope I'm going to have to run over to 105 and uh see if I can find that so uh thank you
[2168.98 → 2173.38] for shopping with Louis Vuitton your product has been crafted by experienced artisans with exclusive
[2173.38 → 2179.54] materials oh my then packed with the utmost care following strict cemetery guidelines blah blah blah
[2179.54 → 2188.74] blah blah blah blah okay, so there's that in French uh judging you so hard right now whatever AJ every
[2188.74 → 2199.46] word what is this uh oh this is my packing slip oh no it's a gift receipt okay all right live unboxing
[2200.02 → 2204.18] Louis Vuitton earphones I actually don't know if that's exactly the model that we got
[2204.18 → 2210.34] they apparently have a bunch of them oh what is this there's a thing here oh hold on there's a thing
[2210.34 → 2216.74] in here I think this is not what is this, but there's nothing there's nothing in here it looked like there
[2216.74 → 2226.10] was something in their okay here we go actually it's fun oh, oh it opens like that okay oh look at that
[2226.10 → 2232.02] the presentation though starts pretty strong okay eco-friendly packaging for the most part
[2232.02 → 2239.06] cloth is actually terrible from an uh eco perspective uh especially if it's single use but my kids will
[2239.06 → 2245.94] get plenty of use out of these cute little baggies yeah uh we've got some replacement ear tips so I have
[2245.94 → 2252.58] tiny this the presentation falls apart a little bit here this is just standard plastic printed
[2252.58 → 2258.74] bags with little ear tips in them tiny large small for whatever has a different colour
[2258.74 → 2263.54] of printing on it maybe they source those from a different factory or something oh that's weird i
[2263.54 → 2274.26] have wait what I have two smalls wait what is SM maybe SM is not small why are they both labelled SM okay
[2274.26 → 2277.62] I'm definitely going to talk about that in the video they didn't look the same size to me one of them
[2277.62 → 2281.78] no it's a completely different thing yeah one of them seems to be like a wrap for it yeah help hold
[2281.78 → 2287.94] it in your ear or something yeah okay so I got that and then what's in the other one I have no idea if
[2287.94 → 2292.34] people are even interested in this you know what's the seem like they what's the unboxing experience
[2292.34 → 2298.50] like of a 1500 pair of earbuds really far away okay in the other bag the extra large ear tips are in there
[2298.50 → 2306.90] for some reason I don't know why that would be there's an USB a to c adapter and then a c to c
[2306.90 → 2314.18] charging cable that actually has a leather wow okay I don't know if it's real leather uh hard to say
[2314.18 → 2320.26] is it attached to the cable or does it just fall away it is attached to the cable oh so you've got a
[2320.26 → 2324.98] nice little leather i I personally love it when my cable ties are bulkier than they have to be
[2324.98 → 2332.26] um that's I'm a big fan of that, and obviously we're going to test the lv cable with our cable
[2332.26 → 2345.78] ah nice okay obviously so we got our charging cable all right this feels reassuring hold it whoas
[2346.50 → 2351.38] it's heavy right how much of that is this container though oh almost all of it I would hope I mean is
[2351.38 → 2356.42] this a charging does this charge I have no idea hold on there's more there's more stuff in here
[2356.42 → 2360.58] the battery it is has some like you guys aren't going to be able to hear it or anything, but it has
[2360.58 → 2364.82] some weight in it for sure uh there's a little it's got some weight to it does anyone understand
[2364.82 → 2369.78] that envelope with a cleaning cloth oh I can't open it cleaning cloth I mean that's like uh that's
[2369.78 → 2373.22] like a hundred and whatever dollar value how much does apple charge for their cleaning cloth is it
[2373.22 → 2382.02] 15 bucks I don't remember i I hold on how much uh how much is apples cleaning cloth I thought it was
[2382.02 → 2388.74] like ludicrously expensive or something oh no it's like 25 Canadian okay uh 19 us sorry i i I must have
[2388.74 → 2396.50] added a zero to the stupid price tag okay then we've got a manual all right cool and uh this is
[2396.50 → 2402.34] it this is the moment Luke I can't believe how freaking heavy it's heavy I feel like there's battery in
[2402.34 → 2406.34] there I think that's a charging case which is actually kind of cool nice quality
[2406.34 → 2418.02] zipper okay oh no this is just a case for the case oh wow um okay oh packaging made in China of course it
[2418.02 → 2423.70] is um so what am I going to do with this I mean again my girls would love this can you remove
[2423.70 → 2431.54] the lid of that case while it's in the blue one uh that's a good question so oh okay so it's like a
[2431.54 → 2436.74] a case for your case so that you can case while you case uh they didn't really apparently think of
[2436.74 → 2443.54] that no it um it kind of lifts it out yeah that's a bad experience that's not the greatest um so this
[2443.54 → 2449.94] is like honestly sort of almost a completely pointless yeah, and then they have a window on
[2449.94 → 2457.38] their charging case which is pretty bulky unless you also own a purse which I'm sure they'd be happy to
[2457.38 → 2463.22] sell you um at a pretty good profit margin oh yeah um definitely you're not going to be carrying this
[2463.22 → 2470.02] around with you easily it's pretty, pretty bulky uh here are the earphones themselves the window looks
[2470.02 → 2476.58] kind of nice yeah the window is kind of classy actually it appears to be glass oh not like uh
[2476.58 → 2482.26] plastic all right and the magnet or the hinge or something on that movement seems pretty intense
[2482.26 → 2489.14] yeah yeah feels pretty good feels pretty good okay and then uh this is the first time I have ever
[2489.78 → 2497.62] paid for a Louis Vuitton anything I promise you that, so this is my this is my first okay I'm a Louis
[2497.62 → 2506.18] Vuitton virgin here we go how do I look yeah I don't think that looks cool or good at all
[2506.18 → 2516.42] I'm just like I don't know I'm not exactly uh, uh you know fashionista or anything but wow not into it
[2516.42 → 2522.82] all right well it does look different all it cost me was 1500 would make you stand out which I believe
[2522.82 → 2529.46] is a big part of the point I believe is a big part of the point hearing me and Luke talk about
[2529.46 → 2537.30] like the point of luxury goods is probably not an experience anyone was hoping for or needed on the
[2537.30 → 2543.38] land show today yeah yeah uh there's going to be a full video of it I'm going to be evaluating them from a
[2543.38 → 2548.98] from a performance perspective and you guys know how much you know I care about the additional
[2550.50 → 2555.62] little leather blue pouch that it comes with or whatever yeah I expect them to sound
[2555.62 → 2562.50] 10 times better than AirPods pros they have to or eight times or whatever the math works out to be
[2562.50 → 2569.78] seven times I don't know unless that really weird red box on your head is uh is worth the additional
[2569.78 → 2579.70] cost, but you know what maybe it is I don't know not for me all right um so i I have not I have not
[2579.70 → 2586.34] looked into these very much some people are some people are sort of really uh really concerned about
[2586.34 → 2591.30] the amount of money I spent on them okay so guys first I'm going to make a video about it so this
[2591.30 → 2598.10] is an investment second of all I'm going to sell these and hopefully I can find someone almost as
[2598.10 → 2604.90] stupid as me to pay almost as much as I did, and then it's all good yeah right should be no problem
[2604.90 → 2611.14] there's like probably better ear tips you can get anyway via hangmen says so no lv sponsor for Linus
[2612.02 → 2619.22] yeah I don't think that that was ever a chance I mean when it comes to luxury brands they want
[2619.22 → 2628.34] nothing to do with tech bros like me because we do not give two hoots about the like cool font that you
[2628.34 → 2633.70] use to print your name on stuff yeah it's it better have a performance story I mean that's one of the
[2633.70 → 2639.94] things that I talked to the merch team for us about a lot is like what is the point what is the
[2639.94 → 2645.86] point of anything we're doing, and sometimes the point can be memes lol banana no problem yeah but there
[2645.86 → 2655.62] has to be some kind of point absolutely rod Rosenberg's in chat oh sup rod and rod said I thought
[2655.62 → 2662.42] this was pretty funny Luke has a hard time spending money on stuff at princess auto yeah it sounds about right
[2662.42 → 2670.34] right to be clear I have no problem spending money but I don't like wasting it yeah so yeah you know
[2670.34 → 2676.58] i I actually posted on Twitter recently I decided to I decided to influencer flex for a change because
[2676.58 → 2683.14] it's not really something that I do that often like usually anytime we're doing anything even the gold Xbox
[2683.14 → 2691.70] controller had to have a ROI pitch internally like we don't just do stuff for the Lulu and while we
[2691.70 → 2697.54] didn't end up being able to sell it the absolute worst case scenario for it is we melt it down and
[2697.54 → 2703.86] we still own a gigantic chunk of gold which last I checked is still doing pretty okay not bad so like
[2705.06 → 2713.70] it's fine it's fine um but I decided to influencer flex and post that I bought a gym there have been
[2713.70 → 2721.14] some super chats asking about the gym, so the deal with the gym is that real estate in Vancouver is having
[2721.14 → 2727.94] been a pretty good investment it's happening um particularly industrial um it's something that i
[2727.94 → 2735.22] have not only wanted for a really long time, but it's something that I have had I mean I'm not going to
[2735.22 → 2743.78] use the n-word uh I have don't need it um but I have had a really difficult time getting my girls
[2743.78 → 2748.58] started on badminton because there hasn't been anywhere to play due to all the restrictions on
[2748.58 → 2754.66] gym spaces particularly municipally managed ones that have made it pretty much impossible to just
[2754.66 → 2760.98] go in and occupy space and not be using court time efficiently um I really want to get them started
[2760.98 → 2766.18] they're already you know two years behind when I started my son and the last thing I want is for
[2766.18 → 2771.86] my daughters to be like hey we couldn't help noticing that you know when it comes to trying to
[2772.58 → 2778.42] do this particular father kid activity you really gave our brother all the attention like that is not
[2779.14 → 2787.06] that is not the goal yeah um so I want to get them started on that it's also I think it has the
[2787.06 → 2793.54] potential to be a really cool employee benefit so it's something that we bought as a thing that
[2793.54 → 2798.42] everyone who works at liners media group float plane and creator warehouse can use it's only about six
[2798.42 → 2804.26] minutes from our office which is pretty cool I think, and we're not going to just have a badminton
[2804.26 → 2808.66] court in there, so the idea is to have uh badminton we'll have badminton lines on the floor, and we'll
[2808.66 → 2812.66] have a net that can kind of be shoved over to the side and I want to have all kinds of stuff there
[2812.66 → 2816.74] so there's a little bit of space kind of at the front of the unit out of the way of the court where we
[2816.74 → 2822.74] could have you know I don't know rowing machine bicycles weights stuff like that um I'd love to
[2822.74 → 2827.78] have just like you know some balls like play some place have some nets play some indoor soccer yeah
[2827.78 → 2833.86] you know uh slap around some some some ball hockey balls what's a ball hockey ball called hockey ball
[2833.86 → 2839.62] I don't think you call it a hockey ball it's just a ball sure, but it's a hockey ball the orange one
[2839.62 → 2843.14] you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah yeah you know slap around some hockey balls put some
[2843.14 → 2847.14] basketball nets up like people want to just go chill yeah I think people just got I'm trying to
[2847.14 → 2852.18] remember now I think people just call it ball I don't think it has like I think it's a ball hockey
[2852.18 → 2857.14] ball yeah I don't know I don't know it's probably more specifically like what it is but I don't think
[2857.14 → 2861.38] I ever heard anyone call it anything else if you went to like sports check to buy one and yeah it's
[2861.38 → 2866.58] probably so AJ is apparently salty that he can't use the gym uh AJ I have offered to pay your moving
[2866.58 → 2872.98] expenses many times for a lot of years so I don't even want to hear about it yeah aj you have you
[2872.98 → 2878.98] have uh at one point in time there was almost an ice cream delivery robot in the mix I don't even
[2878.98 → 2885.54] remember know if you remember that um what yeah we were it was mostly a meme, but we were trying to
[2885.54 → 2889.94] we were trying to get AJ to move over, and he wanted like incentives and I was asking him like what
[2889.94 → 2894.34] do you actually want uh you couldn't come up with anything so he ended up coming with like a robot that
[2894.34 → 2900.18] would deliver him ice cream while he was working and I was like okay but I was joking yes because
[2900.18 → 2910.26] I'm not doing that yeah um all right cool uh moving on NFT bay sure let's talk NFT bay yeah um kind of
[2910.26 → 2916.58] funny it's an art project it's i I believe it does actually work um but I don't I don't necessarily
[2916.58 → 2922.66] expect it to like to stay around forever or anything uh there's over 20 terabytes of NFTs that have been
[2922.66 → 2929.22] right click saved from the Ethereum and Solana blockchains uh the website gives you free access
[2929.22 → 2938.26] to as many crypto punks and lazy lions as you could ever want and everything else um i i I believe it
[2938.26 → 2945.70] he says somewhere that it's like trying to bring to light um like what NFTs actually are and how
[2945.70 → 2953.54] a lot of the images associated with NFTs are hosted on like web 2 style uh storage spaces without
[2953.54 → 2960.66] guaranteed longevity of storage, so the actual reference might 404 eventually and some other
[2960.66 → 2968.18] weird stuff like that um, but that's that's honestly about if it's interesting in an artistic sense and in
[2968.18 → 2972.58] a tech sense and a few other different ways, but there isn't really a ton to say about it and we probably
[2972.58 → 2979.70] can't put it up on screen because there are some lewd NFTs, and we don't know necessarily what's going
[2979.70 → 2985.38] to show up if we load the page uh and do know that before you go to the website if you are planning on
[2985.38 → 2993.86] going there as well um someone said only about 10 gigabytes well rip the notes uh, but there 's's a
[2994.82 → 3000.10] an amount I don't know you know what I'm feeling lucky you're going for it there's an I'm feeling lucky
[3000.10 → 3007.22] so oh okay pirate NFT search I mean I don't know picture if i just search for picture I'm feeling lucky
[3007.22 → 3014.26] what's the first picture I'm going to get okay I didn't get anything too incriminating so here's some pirate
[3014.26 → 3025.54] NFTs we've got a pirate Pikachu uh whatever this is it's a picture yep the whole point of the stuff isn't
[3025.54 → 3032.26] isn't the actual picture an argument that is brought up often is um you can go to the
[3032.26 → 3037.62] louvre and take a picture of Mona Lisa it doesn't mean you own the Mona Lisa blah blah blah blah blah
[3037.62 → 3045.06] yeah oh that is unfortunate okay see you later was there something bad I mean I don't know if I would
[3045.06 → 3050.02] describe it as bad it was pretty tasteful oh okay um all right here you can have a look at it if you want
[3050.02 → 3057.54] that's fine it's on my screen I'll see you later all right it's uh oh my I mean it's unique
[3058.74 → 3067.14] yeah so there's that it yeah because it's uh yeah all right cool see nice uh but yeah um it's
[3067.14 → 3072.82] interesting it's if you're is you're into if you've been paying attention to you know NFT kind of stuff
[3072.82 → 3077.70] it's its an interesting development I find it interesting that the dude's name is very notably
[3077.70 → 3083.70] attached to it yeah like he has a FAQ on his GitHub, and he's like he's a person who's been
[3083.70 → 3094.66] around um like it's this is not his first rodeo um so yeah that I find very surprising um and
[3094.66 → 3104.18] we'll see where that goes, but that's about it okay cool in other fun exciting amazing news um I don't know
[3104.18 → 3110.58] which one to go with halo infinite it's back yes halo's back baby have you played so
[3110.58 → 3116.34] cool yeah not a huge amount but I have played, and it's fun the the main two things that I'm excited
[3116.34 → 3121.70] about aren't out yet but what's really exciting right now is the foundation is absolutely there
[3122.26 → 3128.66] the game feels great it looks great one thing that was just deeply refreshing for me personally
[3128.66 → 3133.78] um I don't know why I care so much about this and this hasn't been a thing for a long time I think I've
[3133.78 → 3140.90] just been so frustrated by modern very, very modern last few years UIs yeah that the UI the load up
[3140.90 → 3149.22] the game, and it's just immediately beautiful right like there's been so many games where like you start
[3149.22 → 3155.38] out in some basement and I don't even mean that I mean you launch the game you haven't clicked anything
[3155.38 → 3162.50] yet, and it's stunning right like the backdrop is absolutely fantastic all the UI elements the GUI
[3162.50 → 3167.06] are really beautiful I know Jayden had some feedback about not being able to find things super
[3167.06 → 3170.42] well I didn't really care i just immediately went into a match because I don't really care about
[3170.42 → 3175.78] customizing my spartan too much sorry if for the three four three people that worked on that I'm just
[3175.78 → 3182.42] whatever I'm sure it's great um but yeah it is feels perfect the gun playing stuff is perfect um
[3182.42 → 3187.62] um i I found some feedback from certain people online that I think haven't played halo in a long
[3187.62 → 3192.10] time yeah uh to be kind of funny they're like wow the time to kill is really long and I'm like
[3192.66 → 3200.18] halo halo halo yeah that's the thing um that you better put a full magazine of needlers needles
[3200.18 → 3204.58] to your opponent yeah the whole idea is supposed to be that it's kind of hard to take a spartan down
[3204.58 → 3209.54] you're fighting other Spartans so it's pretty hard to take a spartan down um I think a lot of other
[3209.54 → 3214.26] people have also forgotten that in halo the shields and the health are actually two very
[3214.26 → 3220.18] different things yeah and like if you remember I think I played a lot of halo 2 personally that was
[3220.18 → 3225.30] my main halo game um and I know in halo 2 especially the plasma pistol battle rifle combo
[3225.86 → 3229.86] was like kingly because if you had a fully charged plasma pistol, and you could hit someone with it
[3229.86 → 3235.14] the shields are gone yeah, and then you could triple shot BR to the head, and it's just over and there
[3235.14 → 3240.34] isn't exactly it doesn't really feel like there's exactly that combination right now um, but you do
[3240.34 → 3244.34] need to mix up the weapons if you use like covenant weapons they're better at taking down the shields and
[3244.34 → 3248.42] you use human weapons that are better at taking down the hp whatever I don't know it feels really
[3248.42 → 3255.14] perfect there's been some complaints out there that the battle pass progression is like not great or
[3255.14 → 3260.74] something again this is something I really don't care about right because it's cosmetic items and I'm i just
[3260.74 → 3267.14] I'm just trying to shoot some stuff um but Microsoft has already responded they've already been working
[3267.14 → 3273.54] on it um they've they've given like apology rewards they did a really, really quick stopgap solution of
[3273.54 → 3279.86] making it so that there was a challenge of just play a game yeah you just do repeatedly over and over and
[3279.86 → 3284.58] over again for points right okay um so that there was like you could progress a little bit easier right
[3284.58 → 3288.58] away, and then they're working on a more long-term solution, and they've they've given some reward for
[3288.58 → 3295.38] people for dealing with it which is great it's free to play which has its positives and negatives
[3295.38 → 3300.82] sure any every positive is that it's free the negatives are everything else yeah pretty much
[3301.46 → 3307.46] every modern game even like Sforza like a racing game has like rampant cheating in it like cheating
[3307.46 → 3314.18] in the modern era is insane, and it's its worst in the fps space um so having it free to play makes
[3314.18 → 3319.94] that even easier, but it also massively increases the player base which is very good for a multiplayer
[3319.94 → 3326.34] game so yeah I don't know uh but yeah the two features that I am most excited for are both not in
[3326.34 → 3332.10] the game right now which is co-op and forge a lot of my favourite experiences in halo are not playing the game
[3332.10 → 3338.42] in just like a quick match format yeah so I'm really excited about forge yeah and then
[3341.22 → 3346.42] another massive amount of what I like halo for is co-op campaign that's also not in the game yet yeah
[3346.98 → 3351.94] I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll load it up I'll download it once co-op's available because realistically I'm not
[3351.94 → 3358.18] going to play a competitive shooter these days I'm not I've I was never very good and I'm especially
[3358.18 → 3365.62] not very good the older I get so I just don't get a lot of enjoyment out of walking around on
[3366.18 → 3371.94] the map for four seconds getting headshot from someone I can't even see by some dude who's
[3371.94 → 3376.10] memorized all the locations of all the sniper spawns and whatever else yeah I'm definitely
[3376.10 → 3382.18] more excited about the other modes like I don't have I like as long as it's not shroud or something
[3382.18 → 3388.66] which I've literally tried to do you know i am pretty comfortable just you know trying to shoot
[3388.66 → 3393.46] a guy who's trying to shoot me at the same time but for me, I don't have the time at this stage in
[3393.46 → 3401.06] my life to like you said memorize all the routes that someone might take and do all that research
[3401.06 → 3406.66] right like watching YouTube videos where people are doing this kind of hardcore analysis okay at the
[3406.66 → 3411.38] moment of spawn you need to basically start counting four and a half seconds and if you can get to this
[3411.38 → 3415.62] point before that they can't hit you so you can get set up so you can just slide down this thing
[3415.62 → 3419.46] and get in position and if they've gone this way you'll probably be able to get like three free kills
[3422.10 → 3427.86] I can't yeah I'm sorry I can't yeah that's like all my favourite stuff in halo is just playing
[3427.86 → 3433.14] with friends not online matchmaking personally like blood bulk with some buddies, and you're even
[3433.14 → 3440.02] good at video games so that's like a very different video games to get over it um what was I what was I
[3440.02 → 3445.46] trying to say there's oh yeah this is an interesting time you all have been watching me for years yeah
[3445.46 → 3451.14] you did and okay you can't even say that because you did that challenge what for people to come play
[3451.14 → 3456.66] you in video games, and you just trashed yeah, but those were like nobody's no offence you're lovely
[3456.66 → 3463.54] people that's the audience man I know, and they're wonderful and I love them, and you beat them well
[3463.54 → 3471.70] yeah, but they like they weren't I'm not saying your shroud no you're not but I don't think
[3471.70 → 3479.30] nobody is I yeah well it's not that I'm good it's that Conrad says I would destroy Linus 1v1 in any
[3479.30 → 3484.26] game I don't know if that's true I think it might be a lot of games because Conrad's one heck of a
[3484.26 → 3489.94] yeah any game I think is probably a bit of a stretch Conrad you want you want to put lunch on that
[3489.94 → 3494.42] because I'm pretty sure I can find a game that I can absolutely shit wreck you at
[3498.82 → 3504.10] epic uh he's probably going to take that um what was I going to buy me lunch is what he's going to do
[3505.94 → 3512.02] um man I had some oh right this is an interesting topic and one that I've been somewhat bottling
[3512.02 → 3516.50] but with the release of Halo Infinite I just can't do it anymore because I didn't want people to jump
[3516.50 → 3522.82] on this negatively because of the Linux challenge yeah, but this has been a bit of an interesting year
[3522.82 → 3527.94] with gaming there's been a lot there's been some good releases there has been there's been a lot of
[3527.94 → 3532.90] really subpar releases a lot of people have been pointing and saying like this is kind of the
[3532.90 → 3538.50] releases that are coming from covid it makes sense there's a lot of disruption in studios etc it's
[3538.50 → 3546.18] like okay, okay okay there's been quite a few not what we were hoping for games Microsoft out of
[3546.18 → 3554.58] freaking nowhere drops three bangers at the end of the year right age of empires 4 yep Sforza horizon 5
[3554.58 → 3559.78] Halo Infinite each one of them the communities are very happy with it that's the thing that matters
[3559.78 → 3564.90] the most to me, I believe they're all like selling well as well, but the communities are happy with all of
[3564.90 → 3570.50] those and like the chance that you were going to piss off the age of empires community with a bad release
[3570.50 → 3577.38] was really extremely high it's really so long and the games are so beloved and that's also true for
[3577.38 → 3585.30] halo yep that's a lot I think the expectations were lower for him that's probably fair I mean age of
[3585.30 → 3592.02] empires 3 was a solid entry in that series yes the quality a little down the quality of AOE had not
[3592.02 → 3599.62] really plummeted you know yeah so that I think no I think age of empires and Sforza were much higher
[3599.62 → 3605.30] risk than halo, but halo is obviously going to be the bigger mover in terms of it being a more popular
[3605.30 → 3611.22] gaming genre in general yeah so the fact that they got them all right is extremely impressive maybe just
[3611.22 → 3618.58] buying every game studio is a strategy I know Bethesda had nothing to do with any of them yeah yeah
[3618.58 → 3624.82] but i and I think like something else that I want to give them praise for as well which I don't think
[3624.82 → 3631.86] it was in the notes here, but it was in my tweet feed was the stability of that launch right it was
[3631.86 → 3637.94] like a what do you call it a surprise launch as far as my understanding goes they just kind of dropped
[3637.94 → 3645.06] it out of nowhere but I also believe there was like a mass I think peak concurrence for like 250 300k on the
[3645.06 → 3650.34] first day or something um that's peak concurrence not total amount of players to be clear and as far
[3650.34 → 3654.66] as my understanding goes their multiplayer was completely fine the whole time you contrast that
[3654.66 → 3661.38] with the owners of AWS launching new world and just completely yeah how embarrassing everywhere it's i
[3661.38 → 3667.30] don't know it's its really it's quite impressive to see Microsoft game studios kind of come out of
[3667.30 → 3671.86] nowhere because I don't someone might be able to correct me here maybe I'm wrong maybe I haven't been
[3671.86 → 3676.42] paying enough attention but for the last while I don't think there's been strong Microsoft game
[3676.42 → 3682.02] releases Microsoft game studios releases for the horizon 4 was pretty successful that's true but
[3682.02 → 3686.98] like that long ago I believe almost every Sforza horizon which is borderline just a copy and paste of
[3686.98 → 3693.22] the previous game has also always done well um that's fair it's kind of hard to go wrong when you're
[3693.22 → 3699.46] just selling people essentially NFTs of cars okay they're not NFTs because they're not even unique so get
[3699.46 → 3703.70] wrecked no they're very easy to get it's a fun game it's fun game I'm not trash on it, I'm just
[3703.70 → 3709.54] saying it's an it's a bit of an easy win yeah that's fair that's fair the game looks beautiful
[3709.54 → 3714.82] and you race cars that are really fast, and they give you lots of dopamine hits by giving you lots of
[3715.38 → 3723.46] spins and free cars and money and blah blah blah blah um so yeah I don't know flight simulator yeah
[3723.46 → 3729.54] that's fair yeah yeah flight simulator was a big w um anyway either way I just found that pretty
[3729.54 → 3736.10] interesting windows on the other hand I noticed that Conrad has not responded to my challenge yet
[3736.10 → 3741.30] so Conrad let me know if you accept and I will choose a game, and you will be embarrassed
[3743.14 → 3749.38] I promise uh why don't we talk about the fall of Activision blizzard shall we okay yeah this is
[3749.38 → 3753.54] another really fun one for me, it's at the point now where Microsoft had to issue a statement saying
[3753.54 → 3757.38] that they're going to have to evaluate their relationship with Activision moving forward
[3757.38 → 3762.58] like this is finally getting the momentum that it deserves and that's not just blizzard right
[3762.58 → 3769.86] because bobby Kodak is the CEO of Activision blizzard so that's that's includes cod is essentially
[3769.86 → 3775.06] what I'm trying to get at because when this first when I first read that I was like oh why does that
[3775.06 → 3780.90] matter Microsoft doesn't do much with like hearthstone or wow or whatever else but that yeah
[3780.90 → 3785.62] that includes cod that's a big deal when you're talking about consoles PlayStation has also had some
[3785.62 → 3792.50] murmurs about similar things as well um, so this is a big pressure for a massive moving game
[3792.50 → 3797.86] which is Call of Duty um more than 800 I believe it's significantly more than that at this point
[3797.86 → 3802.90] Activision blizzard employees and contractors have signed a petition calling for CEO bobby Kodak to be
[3802.90 → 3810.18] removed good uh apparently he knew about all the alleged rapes and other sexual misconducts for
[3810.18 → 3816.02] years if not the entire time uh he allegedly told an employee that he would have her killed
[3816.74 → 3821.38] I don't remember all the details behind that I did read that I just don't remember this moment
[3821.38 → 3828.66] I believe he might have done something to her directly I don't remember don't quote me on that um i
[3828.66 → 3832.18] I know the quote of saying that he was going to have her killed was a thing I just don't
[3832.18 → 3836.34] remember the context around why I don't know if she knew things or things were done to her or what
[3836.34 → 3842.98] there's kind of no good reason no I'm just trying to yeah yeah that's totally very clear
[3842.98 → 3848.66] yes uh it has also been reported that he's likely the one who penned the original email to employees
[3848.66 → 3856.74] claiming uh all of these recent articles were false or only partially true um good guy uh the petition also
[3856.74 → 3862.74] calls for a new CEO to be chosen without Kodak's influence um he has substantial portion of the
[3862.74 → 3867.46] voting rights of the shareholders he owns a lot of the company uh the board of directors made a statement
[3867.46 → 3872.02] on Tuesday uh the goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious the board remains
[3872.02 → 3878.66] confident in bobby Kodak's leadership commitment and ability to achieve these goals uh this contrasts
[3878.66 → 3888.74] very strongly the no tolerance policy that blizzard recently pushed out which is not applying to bobby
[3888.74 → 3899.30] Kodak um the rat it's horrible to get him out he's terrible I've been trying to push this for I think
[3899.30 → 3905.14] like two months now or more than that I think yeah like you know this dude knew what was going on it
[3905.14 → 3910.02] it should have been so clear from the start I'm very happy this came out he has a history of this
[3910.02 → 3918.98] type of stuff I found if it's not hard to find it's on Wikipedia uh with citations yes, yes which is key
[3918.98 → 3928.18] yeah um like i just just stop I don't even know what else to say this is just horrible get him
[3928.18 → 3934.18] out of their clean it all up blizzard needs like blizzard needs to fall back and regroup in a like
[3934.18 → 3944.66] really intense way um yeah yeah all right um hey we sent out a new Ltd store newsletter if you're
[3944.66 → 3951.30] not subscribed to it already I will take a look at it for you look we're going to have a new sticker pack
[3951.30 → 3958.82] for next year cool i I actually love these um this is going to be a pin soon Sarah designed
[3958.82 → 3965.54] a pin based on this graphic uh what else we got in here hey look there's a classic got the Linus
[3965.54 → 3971.62] and Luke uh couch thing it actually was going to be a fist bump but I had concerns about the sticker
[3971.62 → 3976.02] ripping where the fists meet oh and I didn't want to just have like a big ugly border around it so
[3976.98 → 3982.26] um those are cool it's gotten to the point where I get involved in like a lot of like very random
[3982.26 → 3988.50] little things um sort of running the company uh fortunately none of those things involve um
[3989.14 → 3997.78] me needing to be ousted which is good yay not bobby Kodiak yeah very nice I've set a very low
[3997.78 → 4004.74] bar for myself be better than bobby Kodiak yeah um so that's neat
[4004.74 → 4011.14] neat apparently yeah someone actually brought up in flow plane chat and I remember
[4011.14 → 4014.98] reading about this as well yeah one of the problems that they're having right now is that buying him
[4014.98 → 4023.70] out um would be so costly and difficult um and that there's potential I don't know if this was true or
[4023.70 → 4029.14] not right again there are a few things in here that like this news hasn't marinated enough to really
[4029.86 → 4035.14] know all what out of all of it is like super legit uh but I think there's a clause in his
[4035.14 → 4040.58] contract that like makes him additionally very difficult to get rid of great outside just
[4040.58 → 4046.50] needing to buy out his extremely substantial amount of shares um so i I suspect there's something going
[4046.50 → 4053.14] on there I suspect that's why the zero tolerance policy found a very quick found out very quickly that
[4053.14 → 4060.98] it's not exactly zero um yeah all right we should probably do some merch messages because there are
[4060.98 → 4066.02] some perfect questions here some of them are not perfect questions are just ones that I had
[4066.02 → 4072.82] meant to uh pop up on the thing but I didn't catch it in time because the uh the delay is not long enough
[4075.54 → 4082.98] um jersey stat ham says the subliminal messaging finally activated in my brain love if you were a little slow
[4083.14 → 4090.98] um slow on the uptake, but that's good eventually we got through to you that's the goal um jams m says
[4090.98 → 4097.70] celebrating getting my daily driver to number 20 25 in times by extreme on hardware bot pretty freaking
[4097.70 → 4102.98] awesome looking forward to the uh air-conditioned daily driver that you guys teased last week yeah
[4102.98 → 4111.86] that's going to be a heck of a video lots of fun me and Alex um oh my goodness okay guys when i
[4111.86 → 4116.18] announce that we're talking about them is not the time to place orders it's the time for you to have
[4116.18 → 4125.46] already placed an order uh all right i because we can't do all of them uh Michael v says in terms
[4125.46 → 4129.94] of environmental impact I love what Microsoft did with the ocean plastic mouse but if they cared
[4129.94 → 4135.70] wouldn't it be in more flagship devices than anyone actually wants um yeah I think that's a very good
[4135.70 → 4141.78] point however one of the challenges around sustainable materials can actually be getting enough of it
[4141.78 → 4151.14] because yeah you can only make what happens to exist right so you don't necessarily want your
[4151.14 → 4156.26] flagship product that you're going to make the most of to be made out of a material that you can only get
[4156.26 → 4163.54] if other people like waste and throw away other stuff yeah so that's that's tough um yeah
[4165.70 → 4170.02] uh Jonathan a says you said before a big issue with some distros is you can brick them just by
[4170.02 → 4175.46] updating well I mean I wasn't generalizing about that I just happened to have that problem Garuda
[4175.46 → 4180.74] actually creates a restore point at each update um that's fair although my issue oh it apparently gives
[4180.74 → 4185.22] an option to restore it before the OS boots okay that's super cool uh also says I'm visually impaired
[4185.22 → 4191.38] can you make merch messages visible at cart um I'm not sure if I quite understand the question I don't
[4191.38 → 4198.74] can you make them visible at cart um I'm sorry I'm not yeah maybe someone in float plane chat can
[4199.30 → 4206.18] or fire uh this is not technically a message to support I guess yeah, but you should send it to
[4206.18 → 4212.26] float plane support yeah support at floatplane.com yeah um I know that's like kind of odd but yeah send it there
[4213.06 → 4219.78] uh Matthew asks what are my thoughts on the channel super fun house video um Matthew says best
[4219.78 → 4226.74] channel super fun video ever IMO better than nerd sports I have not watched it so Dennis and Ethan
[4226.74 → 4233.54] asked me if I could not watch it so that I could do a reaction video, and so we haven't had a chance
[4233.54 → 4239.06] this week's been super busy gearing up for my trip I haven't travelled in a while so all the kind of the
[4239.06 → 4246.26] the workflows are a little rusty okay it's been a couple of years actually and uh we just haven't gotten
[4246.26 → 4251.78] it together so I'm going to sit down I'm gonna I'm going to watch it and you guys will get to hear all
[4251.78 → 4259.30] of my thoughts as I go through it, I will say I was straight up stunned that it took so long for me
[4259.30 → 4265.54] to find them yeah which I was like i had to yeah I had to put myself in your shoes a few times
[4265.54 → 4272.26] because I'd be like oh that was the mistake he's got him, and then you wouldn't get them but I had to
[4272.26 → 4277.14] kind of think like okay you've got kids in the house you're probably used to these like random
[4277.14 → 4283.22] noises all the time like yeah like stuff moves around in my house my wallet was missing for three
[4283.22 → 4290.42] months because my daughter put it in her school backpack so at the end of the school year it was
[4290.42 → 4296.18] just in there I had no reason to open that we didn't find it till September oh my goodness and I was
[4296.18 → 4302.10] sure that it hadn't left the house because I hadn't left the house so I was like well it's
[4302.10 → 4307.70] here somewhere like unless it was stolen by the insulation guys that are working on the insulation
[4307.70 → 4312.26] in the roof which I don't think it was they seem like good blokes then it's in here somewhere so i
[4312.26 → 4316.42] didn't replace any of my cards thankfully yeah because I knew I had if it was just a matter of
[4316.42 → 4321.06] where it searched the house high and low so many times I was driving around with no license for like
[4322.02 → 4328.82] almost three months why well that's not good I mean I have a license i just the air tag wasn't on me i
[4328.82 → 4335.94] thought was pretty interesting so i i I've read some of the comments on it so I do know some stuff
[4336.98 → 4345.22] I legitimately blanked it looked like an air tag to me, but it didn't compute have you ever have you
[4345.22 → 4351.94] ever seen someone that you know well but in a context where you wouldn't as easily recognize
[4351.94 → 4360.02] them and it has taken a while yeah so I tend because your brain's like that can't be I tend to be a very
[4360.02 → 4367.86] associative uh I tend to have a very associative memory so if I had seen that thing on Jonathan horst's
[4367.86 → 4376.02] desk I don't okay yeah boom oh you're working on an air tag video yeah I don't own an air I've seen air tags
[4376.58 → 4386.42] twice once um brand sent them as like a sponsor spot and I looked at it and one other time when i
[4386.42 → 4395.54] looked at Apple's event that's it I don't use them I don't own any um so when I pulled that thing out of
[4395.54 → 4402.26] my pocket I was like oh this looks like an air tag, but there's no reason that an air tag should be in
[4402.26 → 4407.94] my pocket I'll put this down and I'll figure it out later I'll deal with it later and because it had
[4407.94 → 4413.70] the brand sticker on it none of the apple branding was visible so I thought conceivably it could be some
[4414.50 → 4421.06] weird little thing that my daughters have that has like a picture of it's like a little like toy or
[4421.06 → 4426.26] like a tiddly wink like I didn't know what it was I was just like oh yeah there's like this thing in
[4426.26 → 4430.90] my pocket I'll deal with this later so I hacked it on my nightstand because I was like there's no
[4430.90 → 4439.54] reason for this to be in my pocket um if I had is I had thought even if I thought this is what do you
[4439.54 → 4443.54] think from that yeah I wouldn't have I honestly wouldn't have thought anything of it I'd have thought
[4443.54 → 4448.50] oh this made its way you must have like seen it somewhere weird and picked it up maybe one of the
[4448.50 → 4454.82] camera guys put one in one of the camera bags so that we wouldn't lose our camera bag for some
[4454.82 → 4459.30] reason and then left it in there, and it fell out when they were at the house people come in and out
[4459.30 → 4464.02] of my house all the time with tech crap maybe it fell out and maybe one of my kids was playing with
[4464.02 → 4470.98] it, and it ended up in my pants that is a perfectly that is a perfectly conceivable way that an air tag
[4470.98 → 4478.42] could have gone from Jonathan horst's desk to my pants pocket entirely innocently and i just it's
[4479.22 → 4488.10] I got my weekend brain on like yeah yeah there's people that on account of that and i I think some
[4488.10 → 4496.42] other things are sure that it is staged and I'm like oh i yeah I'm sure it wasn't yeah i yeah not
[4496.42 → 4501.22] only did I know that it wasn't because I was actually supposed to be a part of it yeah I don't know if you
[4501.22 → 4505.62] even knew that part uh no they told me that they told me that yeah yeah they didn't make it that far
[4505.62 → 4512.26] I'm not surprised guys could have done a better job they were trying to make it interesting which is
[4512.90 → 4519.54] I mean the job I get it I mean it worked it's the first banger channel super fun that we've had
[4519.54 → 4524.18] in a very long it's a fun watch, and it's a fun they did a fantastic job like I'm looking at the
[4524.18 → 4534.34] analytics, and it's uh it's gone from kind of like levelling off to schwa mp algorithm do like yeah so
[4534.34 → 4541.62] it's its going now great job Ethan and Dennis um I did see one comment that they were surprised at
[4541.62 → 4548.66] my reaction to finding people in my house like my first my honestly what I was thinking when i
[4548.66 → 4556.02] walked up to them and I was like did I ruin the video was this was the wrong move because I knew it
[4556.02 → 4562.18] was Dennis a hundred percent because he was smiling oh the way that he does yeah yeah, and so I was like
[4562.18 → 4568.34] the move now would have been to pretend I didn't see you didn't notice them and like then start
[4568.34 → 4575.70] messing with them oh flip the script that would have been the aim oh my goodness that actually could
[4575.70 → 4580.34] have been so funny figure out what they're doing because I have access to the security cameras I could
[4580.34 → 4584.42] have easily tracked their movements so I could have figured out what they're doing I could have start
[4584.42 → 4592.02] messing started messing with their stuff which would have been amazing put like the body pillow like
[4592.02 → 4596.26] man the kind of stuff I could have done like I could have put like I could have put a bunch of you
[4596.26 → 4601.62] know those uh those anchor speakers that we did the 100 speaker oh my thing I could have put a bunch of
[4601.62 → 4605.78] them like stashed kind of around the bed and then just like triggered them in the middle of the night
[4605.78 → 4611.78] and stuff like man there was so much potential and I totally wasted it but I don't know how else you
[4611.78 → 4618.18] react to that though because like when when when you spotted him at first it was such a genuine like
[4618.98 → 4630.58] what so how do you not do that you know like that's yeah i yeah oh man oh well if Ethan had hid better
[4630.58 → 4637.62] I might not have like caught them but Ethan was just like standing there yeah that was and as soon as I saw
[4637.62 → 4643.78] Ethan I was like channel super fun Dennis it could have been anything if Dennis had just played it cool
[4643.78 → 4649.14] and been like oh yeah did Yvonne not tell you we're going we're going running today I'd have been like
[4649.14 → 4653.86] oh yeah no she didn't tell me why were you in the backyard okay whatever you know what forget if it's
[4653.86 → 4659.22] just Dennis things like if is is Ethan had hidden and Dennis had like played it cool
[4661.06 → 4665.38] yeah they could have gotten away with it yeah yeah for sure and Dennis could have done whatever it is
[4665.38 → 4669.22] that you know arts and crafts night with Yvonne or whatever like they see each other outside of work
[4669.22 → 4674.58] um they could have done whatever Dennis could have left could have snuck back into the house
[4674.58 → 4682.58] and I would have been none the wiser 100 one thing that this has definitely um brought to light for me
[4682.58 → 4685.06] is that my wife could absolutely be having an affair
[4685.06 → 4696.90] like my observation level you know a little low clearly extremely low so you know if anyone
[4696.90 → 4704.66] was thinking man I'd love to make a move on that, but you know Linus would you know use his YouTuber
[4704.66 → 4708.58] influence to make my life miserable or whatever clearly I'd never notice
[4708.58 → 4720.74] uh what else we got for merch messages here uh max asks what is the float plane release schedule for
[4720.74 → 4726.34] the remaining Linux challenge videos they're coming yes part two is edited I believe the plan is for it
[4726.34 → 4732.74] to go up this weekend oh that is the goal if I just delete these are they deleted or like
[4732.74 → 4737.70] what is it what happens can I delete them to just manage ones that I am not going to do anything with
[4737.70 → 4744.34] you can, they'll just be like gone through I think there's a deleted well that's fine it's a
[4744.34 → 4748.50] deleted thing is a little weird yeah maybe it could just be archived, and then it could just go down to
[4748.50 → 4753.30] the very bottom yeah because there's a deleted section, so yeah archive would probably make yeah
[4753.30 → 4758.26] so if I could just yeah I'll just delete the ones that I've already dealt with here yeah uh Mikhail says
[4758.82 → 4763.38] could you please make a LTT about the current state of optical media technology things like triple
[4763.38 → 4772.02] layer discs disc and so on I believe we covered disc at some point that may have been on NCI tech
[4772.02 → 4780.10] tips uh yeah you and I did a disc episode like 10 years ago so yeah so the current state yes uh we did
[4780.10 → 4787.46] do that the current state of optical media appears to be not that different from nine years ago um so I guess
[4787.46 → 4792.82] this no update is needed look at this guy look at his hair it's ridiculous he looks like an
[4792.82 → 4797.86] idiot why is the TV behind him instead of screen capture look at this why doesn't he care about
[4797.86 → 4808.26] his appearance it's awful it's awesome there's a bunch of glare on the TV whatever premium as if it would
[4808.26 → 4813.62] have looked any better if you shot it wait you did shoot I did shoot it yeah okay so there you go I was
[4813.62 → 4820.34] probably asleep probably he used to legitimately fall asleep in the chair um mind has got some
[4820.34 → 4829.22] chicken buggies very nice um all right hey thanks Michael m love it and uh merry Christmas Alex is the
[4829.22 → 4837.78] message there Dara uh found out this week I'm having a daughter heck yeah getting the ABCs of gaming for
[4837.78 → 4843.38] the daughter and a friend of mine who's also having a baby freaking a fantastic love it
[4843.38 → 4849.30] all right uh delete now what's the okay I already responded to this one uh john g when are you going
[4849.30 → 4854.26] to start selling LTT pants and socks I want to wear LTT from head to toe so that if I'm going to be a
[4854.26 → 4859.54] walking advertisement I can at least do it properly so fun fact you ready
[4864.74 → 4866.10] I am actually wearing
[4866.10 → 4877.46] prototype LTT socks yes so finally they are merino wool they have uh extra padding in the toes
[4877.46 → 4883.14] and the heel they have extra venting on the top so whether you have an open shoe or a closed shoe
[4883.78 → 4891.54] you can expect to get a little bit more airflow on the top um they right now are extremely close in
[4891.54 → 4897.22] terms of the density of the weave that I wanted like in terms of durability um I still need to
[4897.22 → 4902.10] wash this pair to find out if we've solved the pilling problem and I would still like to see if
[4902.10 → 4909.86] we can reduce the slipperiness of the sock I like a little bit more grip but overall um this is my first
[4909.86 → 4919.06] day with this demo pair I am pretty darn happy um and if you guys want I can uh I can go get some pants
[4919.06 → 4925.22] right now so why don't you do a couple more merch messages and then I'll be uh I'll be right back
[4925.94 → 4933.62] yeah good all right um AJG says when's female clothing coming to LTT store as far as my understanding
[4933.62 → 4940.34] goes they are working on it in addition to other kind of more like sizing options things like
[4940.34 → 4947.06] tall wide etc um but it takes time it's difficult to do that kind of stuff uh allocation
[4947.06 → 4953.78] right now is difficult etc etc etc um but yeah it's if it is an it is something that they want to do
[4953.78 → 4957.70] also female underwear as well as far as my understanding goes that is also included in
[4957.70 → 4962.90] the previous statement that I said but I could be wrong maybe hit up nick on Twitter um and then
[4962.90 → 4970.42] says also sup other AJ watching on flow plane nice heck yeah Brandon r says thanks for being
[4970.98 → 4977.54] half my closet and keeping my love of tech alive going to school uh for networking now keep up the
[4977.54 → 4984.50] great work go flow plane heck yes, thank you very much bought a bunch of bananas anonymous said just got
[4984.50 → 4991.06] HDMI 2.1 2x2 switch and was wondering if that cable tester you have can test anything with HDMI
[4991.06 → 5001.46] sitters splitters switches and capture cards no idea sorry uh Christopher h thoughts on what is this
[5003.78 → 5014.42] TLR lab open source LTT licensed community contributions yeah I doubt it um maybe there's
[5014.42 → 5021.22] certain ways that we can like validate that stuff we can maybe look into that um I'll maybe check that
[5021.22 → 5029.06] thread out later, but there are a lot of potential issues there that's a that's quite the minefield so
[5029.06 → 5036.42] yeah PS Luke hope that 5950x is still slinging bits after the pair it absolutely is so heck yeah
[5036.42 → 5048.58] cool nice I like the zipper pockets too we wanted to uh oh I guess you guys probably won't be able
[5048.58 → 5054.98] to hear me very well I'm just going to change real quick oh okay oh uh is this allowed on twitch I don't
[5054.98 → 5060.02] think so okay well but if you're legitimately behind the chair I'm behind the chair yeah he's behind the
[5060.02 → 5073.94] chair it's fine it's okay all right there we go wan joggers ladies and gentlemen that matches the hoodie
[5074.66 → 5079.86] pretty well of course it does it's made out of exactly the same material oh they're wan joggers
[5081.30 → 5088.18] oh my goodness yeah because they have the logo on the other pocket too yeah, so there's it's like a
[5088.18 → 5094.58] stealth logo yeah wow that's super cool extra pockets on the inside dude once you have those
[5094.58 → 5102.50] and socks when that's cool um I don't have to own any other clothes yeah another zipper pocket on the
[5102.50 → 5109.14] back just in case condom pocket that's actually our internal name for all pockets that have no obvious
[5109.14 → 5116.82] purpose with the joke being that like our audience definitely needs lots of condoms
[5116.82 → 5125.54] um when they buy this merch they do oh nice yeah um so I've got the orange drawstrings
[5126.58 → 5138.18] um another zipper pocket uh kind of like cool uh just like accents yeah, yeah like that um yeah
[5138.90 → 5144.02] I think the fit's awesome obviously sorry I know you guys can't really hear me very well but
[5144.02 → 5152.50] I'm back now it looks good so that's them land joggers are on a ship, and they're coming um man we've
[5152.50 → 5157.30] got there's so much stuff coming we've got some nice like stretchy shorts oh, so those are
[5157.30 → 5162.18] done, and they're just on the way yeah I pulled this out of the size right sweet this is final
[5162.18 → 5171.06] spec awesome yeah I'm extremely excited these are I mean the only problem is that they are
[5171.06 → 5177.46] we just won't have enough of them um Conrad asks aren't those just American Apparel sweatpants
[5177.46 → 5183.78] absolutely not these are our own custom they are using exactly the same material as the wan hoodie
[5183.78 → 5189.54] uh someone asked if the zippers are PKK if they're not my merch team is fired because I told them we only
[5189.54 → 5195.22] use PKK zippers actually I think some of the little hidden ones might not be so the only time we don't
[5195.22 → 5205.06] use PKK is when um there is for whatever reason not a PKK one available uh yeah it is on the sample
[5205.06 → 5210.26] sometimes we don't have PKK zippers on our samples because they're just a fit sample but when it comes
[5210.26 → 5219.30] to uh actual merch that we ship I'm just like it's one of the few blind brand loyalties that I have
[5219.30 → 5224.74] is that whenever a factory tries to sell us on anything other than a PKK zipper I'm just like
[5225.54 → 5232.18] no, no thanks, and it's a big problem because they've had supply issues like everyone and costs have
[5232.18 → 5239.14] gone on zippers which really sucks because it's not just we talk about it as a silicon shortage or
[5239.14 → 5245.94] whatever, but it's its like materials like kind of almost in general captain observant asks why is
[5245.94 → 5250.34] the zipper backwards on the stealth hoodie because most people wouldn't notice, but you're captain
[5250.34 → 5256.58] observant uh it's we just didn't think about it to be perfectly honest with you the zippers backwards
[5257.22 → 5263.46] uh it's its on the opposite side usually it's like one side for female clothes or one side for male
[5263.46 → 5267.78] but it's different rules in commonwealth countries and the US I don't know Bridget explained it to me
[5267.78 → 5272.90] once and I glazed over I was just like whatever I don't care for me, I don't have a muscle memory for
[5272.90 → 5278.90] that I just figure it out and zip up my jacket like I don't yeah I don't I i it doesn't cost me a lot
[5278.90 → 5284.90] of extra brain cycles so yeah yeah uh anyway so hopefully that answers your question it's coming
[5284.90 → 5289.94] it's coming uh I heard you answer a few more are you deleting the ones that you're done with or
[5289.94 → 5296.02] uh no I'm getting a little lost in how this organization is okay so the curated ones I moved
[5296.02 → 5300.50] them ones down there that were not ones that I wanted to show up there but were ones that I wanted to
[5300.50 → 5304.66] acknowledge okay then everything in incoming is done okay I'll delete them up you can keep going
[5304.66 → 5310.82] perfect all right uh Julian says love your videos hey thanks Julian have you guys considered making
[5310.82 → 5314.82] a video comparing different search engines for example I use DuckDuckGo not for its privacy but
[5314.82 → 5320.66] for the convenience of bang search no I have not considered making a video about uh comparing
[5320.66 → 5331.38] different search engines um yes no I have not um I don't know that we would do that I think that's
[5331.38 → 5337.78] probably that's probably going to be a tough sell I don't I don't think that would perform particularly
[5337.78 → 5345.94] well um Paul says undies hi I'm Paul I don't know why I moved that into curated oh probably because i
[5345.94 → 5349.78] just missed the notification because Conrad didn't give me enough time speaking of which
[5349.78 → 5356.42] we have an update on the Conrad challenge uh Conrad says I can pick any game give him two weeks to learn
[5356.42 → 5363.06] it, and he will beat me Conrad I'm sorry to do this to you but i really just I'm kind of feeling hungry
[5363.06 → 5368.58] and I really want someone to buy me lunch so I choose beat safer I'd give you two months to play beat
[5368.58 → 5372.98] safer but I've been known to I don't think you should have any training time I've been known to make
[5372.98 → 5378.18] concessions I think he should just play you like right away he said any game boom no there was no
[5378.18 → 5383.78] I'm fine with two weeks I don't think david still owes me uh still owes me a and I beat you at
[5383.78 → 5388.34] beat safer uh, uh challenge he says the end of the month by the way for the people who keep up asking
[5388.34 → 5395.54] about that all right so Conrad uh you've got two weeks to get better than me at beat safer good luck
[5395.54 → 5400.74] okay epic good I could have gone a couple different directions but yeah I could have gone with forged
[5400.74 → 5404.98] alliance that's that's a game that is not easy to pick up in two weeks even if you're a very
[5404.98 → 5411.22] experienced gamer um like Luke is a better gamer than me pretty much any genre like we sit down and
[5411.22 → 5416.58] play a conventional uh RTS like star craft or something like that, and he will absolutely destroy
[5416.58 → 5424.34] me not forged alliance is just it hits a little different not even close um it's like a full-time
[5424.34 → 5430.58] job keeping up with the meta even though it's like a 12-year-old game or whatever okay what else we got
[5430.58 → 5437.22] here in the merch messages uh any plans for heavier winter wear asks Eric w yes we do so remember if
[5437.22 → 5444.66] you are subscribed to the LTT store um newsletter you'll have seen that we did a post about this
[5444.66 → 5454.98] like 3d printed down style like material um we have a jacket that would be meant to kind of go on top of a
[5454.98 → 5460.26] hoodie like it's not a super insulated one, but it's like a layering up kind of shell uh waterproof
[5460.82 → 5465.86] uh we're working on that we also have a wind breaker that's even lighter than that it's just a pure shell
[5466.42 → 5471.78] we're working on that um I don't know if either of those is going to make it for this winter but the
[5471.78 → 5477.14] thing about LTT store is that we're not really constrained in the same way that a lot of more
[5477.14 → 5484.42] traditional clothing businesses are if we miss a season we're like f it launch it anyway
[5484.42 → 5493.22] sucks oh well yeah people in Australia can buy it you know what do we care I mean we care
[5493.22 → 5501.62] obviously it'd be nice to you know we have literally millions of dollars deployed right now in merch that
[5501.62 → 5506.90] we have purchased but have not received and cannot sell and therefore cannot make back our investment
[5506.90 → 5513.06] on uh obviously we definitely want to sell stuff yeah, but it's not like we're under the same kind
[5513.06 → 5521.06] of pressure where if we miss it by a month you know now it's on fire sale, and we're selling it at
[5521.06 → 5526.26] a loss following whatever various current fashion trends whatever, and we literally can't reuse it next
[5526.26 → 5531.38] year like it's not like that so it makes life a little bit easier for us but
[5531.38 → 5538.42] that uh man I really like that uh that that shell jacket with the printed down type material
[5538.42 → 5544.10] inside if it's super warm it's super comfy it's got like a really nice hand feel to it, I really like
[5544.10 → 5550.26] it uh that that's a garment where sometimes you start with what your goal is in terms of the finished
[5550.26 → 5557.06] product so with wan hoodie v2 we started with the goal of making wan hoodie but like better um and then
[5557.06 → 5561.70] we went, and we found we sourced materials, and we sourced construction methods like we figured it
[5561.70 → 5567.94] out um with the jacket we found a material we really liked, and we were like let's make a garment now
[5569.06 → 5573.78] it can kind of go both ways I was asking Bridget about it and apparently that's actually more common
[5573.78 → 5580.26] than you might think to find a really cool material and then be like okay we have to do something what can
[5580.26 → 5590.02] we do with this what is its best application yeah um thoughts between valve index or HTC five money is
[5590.02 → 5596.50] not an issue well if money is not an issue I mean the index is obviously the way to go José but i also
[5596.50 → 5603.86] just got a review unit of the Pima 8k or pix max or whatever they're called I think Pima and uh also
[5603.86 → 5609.38] their 5k one which I believe supports an even higher refresh rate than the index so I'm going to have a video
[5609.38 → 5614.18] coming on those once I get a chance to really try and daily drive them also like is he talking about the
[5615.06 → 5621.06] the five flow or I'm not sure which it almost doesn't matter because if you're going for the highest
[5621.06 → 5626.58] possible performance the index is better it's its there uh Christian asks what's your favourite colour
[5627.54 → 5631.62] I feel like I've answered this question on wan show before I'm not six I don't have a favourite colour
[5632.74 → 5639.14] um do you have a favourite colour not really okay I used to like answer that with
[5639.14 → 5644.34] red but now at this point it's like well no not really I don't know so I don't know
[5644.90 → 5649.14] um it's just kind of yeah good album re-released recently oh um
[5651.70 → 5656.98] uh this is a cool suggestion from anonymous I think it was last wan show someone asked about
[5656.98 → 5662.74] fashionable anti-static wrist straps but I was wondering if it would be possible to make an anti-static
[5662.74 → 5670.02] watch strap so you just get a watch strap that's like just a broadly compatible watch strap then you
[5670.02 → 5674.42] just have like an anti-static do hickey on there, and then you can just clip on and clip off and you
[5674.42 → 5681.38] never have to take on put on and take off your strap ever again standard g-shock with a little yeah
[5681.38 → 5689.30] would be awesome that's actually a brilliant idea yeah that'd be sweet um i I like it, I'm going to email
[5689.30 → 5693.78] it to nick nice do you want to do another one while I do that sure
[5696.66 → 5704.18] this is from anonymous very qualified for Ltd lab position has put has published four academic papers
[5704.18 → 5710.66] and one patent damn Daniel but can't start for at least six months PhD thesis defence and don't have
[5710.66 → 5715.22] Canadian work visa that's a bit of an issue that's tough but if you have those kinds of credentials
[5715.22 → 5719.38] it's a lot easier to get you in here which is one of the reasons that I didn't bring that up to the
[5719.38 → 5726.18] same degree as I have in the past in the hiring video so you have to have like mean credentials like
[5726.18 → 5733.70] that though um he says should I bother applying absolutely I would yeah yep Luke what led you to using
[5733.70 → 5740.58] oh that jumped around oh goodness um angular over react view or others uh love the
[5740.58 → 5746.34] channel and love what Ltd is doing for tech um my developers were like hey we want to use this
[5746.34 → 5747.94] and I was like sweet
[5751.78 → 5755.62] okay yeah I know there was it was a good management loop it was a conversation over
[5756.42 → 5763.46] a decently extended period of time but um two of the main developers that do most of the work that would
[5763.46 → 5771.54] be that part of the project wanted to use angular so I'm sorry I'm not going to butcher your name um so
[5771.54 → 5777.38] i I'm going to go with iv your initials um hey from Brazil any chance of an iOS job position opening
[5778.02 → 5784.98] um we have one dev that actually does both android and iOS for us, and he is that's probably the word that
[5784.98 → 5792.50] I would use so we don't need another one right now because he is too overpowered yeah pretty much yeah you
[5792.50 → 5797.86] heard it here first but uh there's probably going to be a raise in his future when we talk about that
[5797.86 → 5803.38] pretty soon heck yeah yeah I think that guy's name was Isaac um oh is that I think it's just
[5803.38 → 5808.18] I think it's just an interesting spell oh like a more like South American kind of spelling yeah got it
[5809.22 → 5814.90] uh Joe says I started watching your videos back in 2014 they helped me much in my oh we don't
[5814.90 → 5820.58] also we don't only use angular just to be clear sorry um building my first pc I started mining this year
[5820.58 → 5825.94] you helped me get ahead so time to pay it back a little um mining not exactly a popular
[5825.94 → 5831.14] thing with the pc community at the moment although can i kind of go off script a little bit here
[5832.34 → 5838.82] I think there are a lot of closet miners in the gaming community yeah like I think there's a lot of hate
[5839.70 → 5844.18] but I think there's a lot of closet when there's when there's so much hate around a subject like that
[5844.18 → 5848.26] a huge amount of the population that is receiving the hate is just going to not talk about it
[5848.26 → 5856.10] so you don't know they're there yeah 100 yeah I think that's uh I think that's a bit of a thing
[5856.10 → 5863.78] so there's that uh hey thanks Joe uh anonymous you should make more all black stuff really nice for
[5863.78 → 5868.18] work also an all black desk pad would be cool we have an all black desk pad coming it's going to have
[5868.18 → 5872.90] like a circuit design kind of like the wall in the lounge, but it's going to be black on black so like
[5872.90 → 5879.38] stealth circuit desk pad we've actually had a lot of feedback that um people in different like
[5879.38 → 5885.30] working situations are able to wear the all black stuff um like last show when I was just doing these
[5885.30 → 5889.46] we had feedback from multiple different people that they worked in environments where they were not
[5889.46 → 5893.38] allowed to wear things with branding and logos, but they were able to get away with the stealth
[5894.42 → 5898.66] which I found pretty interesting people in like filming departments that can't wear anything other
[5898.66 → 5903.06] than all black stuff uh there was another one that i I don't remember the context, but he could only
[5903.06 → 5909.86] wear all black stuff uh yeah it was kind of cool yeah I mean honestly the where that came from was
[5909.86 → 5917.22] wanting the product to be good enough that people would want to buy it even if it wasn't merch yeah
[5917.22 → 5921.46] that's the idea that's where the whole stealth name came from like rapping a brand without
[5922.34 → 5928.50] without wanting everyone around you to be like Linus who's Linus you know that kind of thing or
[5928.66 → 5934.34] without um yeah without having to defend it for one thing and then the other part is because I feel
[5934.34 → 5940.42] like it puts more pressure on us to do better than just well we took this café press thing and we
[5940.42 → 5946.58] silkscreened our logo onto it um we didn't always have the time and resources to do that, but it's
[5946.58 → 5953.06] definitely something that we're trying to do now uh Pradesh says love the show given Apple's repair
[5953.06 → 5957.38] programs how do you see right to repair factor in with integrated SOCS considering their performance and
[5957.38 → 5968.02] efficiency improvements so you're never going to be able to repair a SOC like yourself um but that
[5968.02 → 5975.62] doesn't mean that right to repair can't still make devices with SOCS more repairable so you know whether
[5975.62 → 5983.46] it's um it depends it's making schematics available so that you could swap the SOC or whether it's um whether
[5983.46 → 5990.26] it's at least not going out of your way to put encryption keys on the SOC where there's no way
[5990.26 → 5996.34] to that where all your data is gone immediately when you lose access to it there's no way to even
[5996.34 → 6003.78] enter the shared uh or not the shared whatever the there 's's no way to decrypt it even if you
[6003.78 → 6009.06] knew the password right if the is all the encryption data is stored on the SOC even though the storage is
[6009.06 → 6014.90] somewhere else like there are ways that you can make a device more repair friendly even if it's tightly
[6014.90 → 6021.06] integrated which does have clear performance benefits so it's just an attitude problem at the
[6021.06 → 6029.70] end of the day uh Cody says I play Warhammer vermin germinative 2 vermintide oh is it just
[6029.70 → 6036.66] spelled wrong maybe, but it's vermin tide is that a new game no, but it allows you to select the number of CPU
[6036.66 → 6041.22] threads the game can use would you consider trying that game for CPU performance tests probably not
[6041.86 → 6049.62] when we are looking at games that um can stress a CPU it's not necessarily that we're looking for that
[6049.62 → 6054.10] I mean if we wanted to restrict how many threads it was using we could do that um manually we could
[6054.10 → 6060.26] either disable cores on the bios we could um I think I don't know how well it works, but you could
[6060.26 → 6067.30] pin the process to certain cores using windows um and really what we're looking for is games that are
[6067.30 → 6073.06] not very graphically demanding so that they're just a so that the CPU becomes the bottleneck
[6073.62 → 6079.62] uh that's that's really what we're looking for uh there's the organic chemist one wait oh no the
[6079.62 → 6087.70] organic chemist one was a different one oh boy I deleted it now it's gone I feel terrible uh the point is
[6087.70 → 6094.66] deleted section I don't think we do have an organic chemist position no, but then there was a there was
[6094.66 → 6102.58] a wife and the wife had credentials uh control f chemist uh no it's gone oh shoot okay I'm sorry
[6102.58 → 6108.90] uh I feel bad, but there is really nothing that I can do about it now uh Thor says have you considered
[6108.90 → 6113.54] constraining the width of LTT store to some centred container that doesn't span across the whole width of
[6113.54 → 6122.74] your screen they include in that comment it looks a little weird on ultra wides, and they are correct
[6122.74 → 6127.46] it does look a little weird on ultra wides um because it is spans really wide but if you're
[6127.46 → 6131.62] looking at me like you're waiting for me to answer this question no I'm giving you feedback because i
[6131.62 → 6136.34] don't I don't know if you've tried it or not, but it spans really wide but I believe it only shows
[6136.34 → 6142.74] four products wide or something um so it is pretty funky uh, and we are looking into doing more that one of
[6142.74 → 6146.58] the things that's holding us back a little bit from doing a lot of theming changes to the store
[6146.58 → 6153.22] right now is that there's this new hydrogen thing coming out um it hit more of an open beta recently
[6153.22 → 6160.10] but we were in more of like a closed beta program with it um, and we want to use that, but that is going
[6160.10 → 6166.98] to involve like a whole redo to the store so I don't necessarily want to do a ton of little stuff
[6166.98 → 6173.78] like that right now um because I'd rather put that work into the whole remake of the store
[6174.82 → 6181.78] got it but yes I hear you, and it's its not great Henry could you consider a supplement to the Linux
[6181.78 → 6185.30] challenge maybe episode seven where Anthony or someone goes over what to look for in a Linux
[6185.30 → 6189.62] distro for gaming and some that are particularly good for game compatibility for a new user I think
[6189.62 → 6195.06] what we already learned through the Linux challenge is that Linux people are not going to have
[6195.62 → 6201.14] that much difficulty in any distro obviously some will be easier than others and non-linear people
[6201.70 → 6208.10] it is a barrier that is not reasonably overcapable if your only goal is to play games if your goal is
[6208.10 → 6213.46] to play games and to learn Linux as a hobby that's a completely separate question in which case go do
[6213.46 → 6217.46] your research on that or go distro hop because that's that's sort of the whole point because that's
[6217.46 → 6225.46] what you're doing yeah right um Joshua uh VMware workstation pro 16 added support for direct
[6225.46 → 6229.94] x11 and OpenGL 4.1 for virtual machines and games it would be interesting to see a deep dive into what
[6229.94 → 6240.66] can be done with this feature um yeah maybe we haven't tooled around with VMware too much
[6242.18 → 6245.94] and it seems like there'd be a bit of a learning curve for us to figure out what to do with something like
[6245.94 → 6251.30] that, but it's definitely cool Zachary says my father-in-law is the director of an amazing
[6251.30 → 6256.02] international non-profit called curious learning that's uh apps and content to increase literacy
[6256.02 → 6260.10] in developing countries would it be worth suggesting they reach out for a potential collab we don't do a
[6260.10 → 6268.34] ton of collabs just for the sake of collab, and we tend to try to keep things pretty on topic and by on
[6268.34 → 6275.30] topic I mean like hardware on topic software is not really something that we've got a lot of audience
[6275.30 → 6279.94] overlap with believe it or not yeah there are certain categories that you would think um intuitively
[6279.94 → 6286.18] would perform really well for us but I was actually having a conversation with um our tech wiki writer
[6286.18 → 6292.50] john about how you know gaming topics are not performing particularly well on that channel and
[6292.50 → 6296.26] he's like what are they just not gamers, and it's like well it's not that they're not gamers it's just
[6296.26 → 6303.38] that that might not be what they consume on YouTube right yeah um Michael asks thoughts on some
[6303.38 → 6310.02] chip manufacturing we move to the US and how slash when it will affect this shortage slash the market
[6310.02 → 6316.02] well not for a few years but yes it should help, but it also won't affect certain things um like for
[6316.02 → 6319.78] example one of the issues with the automotive industry is they're still just using a bunch of
[6319.78 → 6324.82] outdated crap that nobody wants to build more fab capacity for so if they don't change that then it's
[6324.82 → 6329.22] not going to help and this is part of your question but fab capacity takes a long time to bring
[6329.22 → 6334.66] online uh and even when it is online as far as my understanding goes it takes a bit to get it
[6335.22 → 6341.94] efficient as well uh Chris e uh yes more wan themed products like the pants that I'm wearing right now
[6341.94 → 6346.82] uh would love to get your thoughts on DIY perks custom PS5 chassis I haven't actually seen it
[6346.82 → 6354.50] uh sounds cool everything DIY perks does is amazing yeah Chris b uh this topic reminded me that I could
[6354.50 → 6357.78] use new water bottles so I went with the Stormtrooper look one in hopes it won't hit anything and will
[6357.78 → 6363.30] stay dent free for longer that's very funny Chris get it is won't hit anything we've
[6363.30 → 6369.30] actually had that joke a couple of times have we already all right well that's a shame uh my or MAL
[6369.30 → 6375.06] asks any word on the new kids book I haven't started it yet I'm sorry you are making one though
[6375.06 → 6378.26] uh though I want to do a counting book I want to do a colours book shapes book i just
[6381.38 → 6386.90] also is Ltd 2022 happening so far that is the tentative plan we're going to try we're going to give it a shot
[6387.78 → 6392.66] uh hunter been watching since the Langley house love the way your channel's going would you say
[6392.66 → 6397.06] secret lab chairs are comfy so they sponsored this show full disclosure like they were a sponsor of the
[6397.06 → 6404.10] wan show but uh before secret lab had sponsored us um we talked about them in Alex's intel extreme
[6404.10 → 6409.94] tech upgrade and as far as I can tell they're using exactly the same materials as taxonomic who I've been
[6410.50 → 6415.78] an advocate for through sponsorship and not sponsorship for many years now I think they're good quality
[6415.78 → 6421.30] chairs uh they don't have a lot of the same issues as the other gaming chairs they are still they have
[6421.30 → 6427.06] that look right but uh the material quality is significantly better than a lot of the really
[6427.06 → 6436.02] bad gaming shares out there yeah um final two last two Eduardo oh wait this is more asking about LTT
[6436.02 → 6442.02] socks charity answered that sup Eduardo and Matthew can float plane get merch discount codes like the YouTube
[6442.02 → 6447.06] join channel uh yes I don't see why not but I don't know if we have a mechanism for it yet uh we can
[6447.70 → 6453.06] we can get it working though okay do you want to like throw that in the dock or whatever it's there
[6453.06 → 6470.02] and do you want to throw this show to being over yeah, thanks for watching bye
[6472.02 → 6492.82] Anthony says short answer re good distro for gaming there isn't the best distro for gaming distros are
[6492.82 → 6497.62] little more than package management and defaults yeah that's fair there are some that are set up to
[6497.62 → 6501.62] get going more easily but as we've seen easy isn't necessarily universal depending on package
[6501.62 → 6507.46] stability and hardware configuration also the easiness in my opinion is almost nothing like
[6508.10 → 6515.06] you pre-install the graphics driver which takes literally seconds in a lot of operating systems
[6515.06 → 6521.86] and in some distros sorry uh and like in the case of mint it was this big pop-up in the
[6521.86 → 6527.14] corner that was like do you want to do the thing and I was like yup, and it was like cool I did it for you
[6527.14 → 6534.90] and that was the only gap cool like it's not the hard part um pick the distro that has the most
[6534.90 → 6541.30] comfortable defaults and go from there Linux challenge part seven is now over fair enough Anthony
[6541.30 → 6555.14] mic drop Anthony all right and we're done
