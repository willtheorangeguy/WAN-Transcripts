[0.00 --> 5.40]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the WAN show. We've got a fantastic show for you lined up today.
[5.72 --> 14.86]  Lots of big news, including, of course, the slightly embarrassing attack on Instagram from
[14.86 --> 21.34]  Signal, where they actually created an ad campaign that showed people what Facebook
[21.34 --> 29.90]  knows about them right in the ad. In other news, there's some developments in the epic,
[30.50 --> 37.86]  epic versus Apple court saga. It's an epic saga about epic versus Apple. I'm sorry if that was a
[37.86 --> 45.12]  little confusing. What else we got, Luke? Life or death of the paywall. There's an airbag that will
[45.12 --> 49.80]  only deploy if you have your payments up to date. So if you let that credit card expire,
[49.80 --> 57.36]  you might just die. Also, Disney built a really, really genuinely cool looking lightsaber that I'm
[57.36 --> 61.84]  excited to show everyone. Really? That's one of your headline topics? Not that Sennheiser doesn't
[61.84 --> 68.36]  make headphones anymore? Okay, I forgot because that's not even technically a... I don't know
[68.36 --> 73.36]  what's going on with that. Okay, I would give that one of my spots, but I don't know what that is
[73.36 --> 78.72]  because it's not a topic. All right, we're going to talk about that and more. Let's roll that intro.
[79.80 --> 108.98]  And the show is brought to you today by... I'm pretty sure Ridge Wallop's in there. Ridge Wallop and
[108.98 --> 117.48]  Squarespace. What the... Luke, you're gone. What? You're a gone boy. Oh, wow. And you're back.
[117.86 --> 122.04]  All right. And the sun went behind a cloud since I adjusted my lighting. So I'm going to go ahead
[122.04 --> 128.74]  and fix that and we can jump real quickity styles into our first topic of the day, which is, of course,
[130.02 --> 132.52]  I forget. I forget what I said as the first topic, actually.
[132.52 --> 141.58]  Oh, that was the Signal thing. Ah, yes. Oh my gosh. This is so funny. It's almost as funny as I have
[141.58 --> 146.32]  invisible cursor syndrome on my computer right now. So I can see where my mouse highlights things,
[146.32 --> 153.26]  but I can't actually see where it is. That sounds super annoying. But on Tuesday,
[153.26 --> 158.20]  the encrypted messaging service named Signal published a blog post explaining that they had
[158.20 --> 164.26]  bought ads on Instagram that would show users how they were targeted. And some of the examples of
[164.26 --> 168.92]  this are actually kind of amazing. They're pretty spectacular. Yeah.
[168.92 --> 172.04]  Yeah. Like they're really great. I actually really like this.
[172.04 --> 177.80]  I'm going to try and click them. I'm going to try and click them. I'm going to do it.
[179.56 --> 184.36]  The ads are done mad lib style. You'll hopefully see it soon with Facebook's ad targeting
[184.36 --> 188.92]  characteristics filling in the blank. So it would like describe you and the things that you're into.
[189.64 --> 193.80]  User would see an ad describing what Facebook knows about them, essentially, which is in a lot of
[193.80 --> 200.52]  cases I suspect quite accurate. After starting what appears to be a test campaign in their screenshot,
[200.52 --> 208.04]  signals ad account was disabled completely in the least surprising move ever. But none of them were
[208.04 --> 213.00]  able to get posted, which kind of blows. But I actually think that would have been really cool.
[213.00 --> 219.08]  That's that's an ad that I would actually probably like to see, you know, this is great. So here's some
[219.08 --> 225.16]  examples. You got this ad because you're a newlywed Pilates instructor and you're cartoon crazy.
[225.16 --> 229.24]  This ad used your location to see you're in La Jolla. I don't know how to pronounce that.
[229.24 --> 235.08]  You're into parenting blogs and thinking about LGBTQ adoption. So there's a whole bunch of examples of
[235.08 --> 240.84]  exactly the kind of stuff that Facebook totally actually does know about you. You got this ad
[240.84 --> 246.20]  because you're a GP with a master's in art history, also divorced. This ad used your location to see
[246.20 --> 250.20]  you're in London. Your online activity shows you've been getting into boxing and you're probably getting
[250.20 --> 259.16]  there on your new motorcycle. It's funny to me because it's not even I don't know why it's so
[259.16 --> 265.88]  shocking to read something like this. Like, Luke, if you saw that in the side banner of your of your
[265.88 --> 269.96]  browser, it would grab me for sure. Wouldn't it wouldn't you look at it and go?
[269.96 --> 275.80]  Because there's a difference between being like, oh, I don't care. I don't have anything to hide. They can have my data
[275.80 --> 281.32]  and having it actually all served back out to you from a third party and realizing like,
[281.32 --> 286.92]  oh, holy crap. Not this is what they're doing with it. Like that makes me a lot more uncomfortable.
[286.92 --> 293.56]  Exactly. Like you got this ad because you're a K-pop loving chemical engineer and you have a new baby
[293.56 --> 297.64]  and just moved and you're really feeling those pregnancy exercises lately. It's like,
[298.44 --> 304.60]  yeah, all of that is exactly the kind of crap that people would definitely post on Facebook
[304.60 --> 309.72]  and give it absolutely no thought whatsoever. Well, yeah, whatever. Who cares if people know that
[309.72 --> 317.96]  like I'm feeling my pregnancy exercises, except it's not the kind of thing that you would actually bring
[317.96 --> 322.92]  up necessarily in a conversation with strangers. Like if you went to your if you went to your spouse's
[322.92 --> 328.76]  work barbecue, you know what I mean? You just if you're not okay telling the random person
[328.76 --> 334.28]  that's sitting across from you on the train. Yeah, that you're a Leo and signal or it's Leo and signal.
[334.28 --> 339.96]  Oh, sorry. It's excuse me. The ads were for signal. If you're a Leo and single, you know,
[340.60 --> 346.12]  like if you wouldn't wear if you wouldn't wear a shirt that says it on it, then some people would
[346.12 --> 352.76]  to be fair. But we're just giving the example. But then maybe it isn't the kind of thing that
[352.76 --> 357.80]  you're actually comfortable with, even if you feel like you might be comfortable because you're not
[357.80 --> 365.16]  confronted with what the actual truth is of this information. I mean, honestly, I would love to get
[365.16 --> 373.96]  these ads and find out what Facebook thinks of me. I suspect that Facebook, Google, probably to a much,
[374.52 --> 381.40]  much lesser extent, Amazon know pretty much all there is to know about me. Like mine would be
[381.40 --> 388.36]  something along the lines of you got this ad because you're a tech bro and you have however many kids
[388.36 --> 395.64]  and you're super into reading fanfics of yourself and Luc Lafreniere. We don't really get that. But
[395.64 --> 399.96]  some of those are pretty good. Yep. Some of them, some of them are, you know, most excellent high literature.
[399.96 --> 408.52]  Um, and for some reason, I don't care about it, but it would still be really unnerving to have,
[408.52 --> 414.20]  like, I would almost feel like if I had that information on my screen and I, or like I'm at
[414.20 --> 421.80]  my computer, right. And my mom, you know, someone that I'm close to, but don't necessarily tell
[421.80 --> 426.92]  everything to, you know what I mean? And if my mom was sitting next to me, I would worry,
[426.92 --> 432.84]  what's the next banner ad going to have in it. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like it's a,
[432.84 --> 438.92]  it's an amount of depth of information that it's, it's just because everything in that one
[438.92 --> 444.92]  was something, yeah, you know what? Yeah. I'm okay with this. Um, doesn't mean that the next one
[444.92 --> 448.92]  would be, I mean, here's a, here's a really interesting one. You got this ad because you're
[448.92 --> 453.08]  a teacher, but more importantly, you're a Leo and single. So I already said that part,
[453.08 --> 457.48]  this ad used your location to see you're in Moscow. You'd like to support sketch comedy.
[457.48 --> 462.28]  And this ad thinks you do drag. It's like, okay. Yeah. Doing drag, whatever to me,
[462.28 --> 466.76]  if you're in Moscow, that might not actually be the coolest thing for everyone to know.
[466.76 --> 472.12]  Um, from like a safety perspective, I don't mean that I care if people dress in drag, that's
[472.12 --> 479.72]  totally up to them, but I'm not Vladimir Putin. So my opinion on that in Moscow, um, doesn't quite
[479.72 --> 486.60]  matter as much as certain other people's do, uh, in terms of, you know, making sure that you're safe
[486.60 --> 495.16]  and, and, and okay. Right. Um, so it's just, man, like you got this ad because you're a certified
[495.16 --> 500.60]  public accountant in an open relationship. Like how I shouldn't say, how would they know stuff like
[500.60 --> 509.72]  that? Because man, I know people, I know people on Facebook that post a lot of like really intimate
[509.72 --> 519.00]  details, actually one about a lot of that kind of stuff. Uh, and just kind of don't think at all about
[519.00 --> 525.40]  what that might do to the kinds of ads that they're getting and like how they're profiled. And the thing
[525.40 --> 534.12]  is like contextual content on the internet, right? It has a way of even shaping you. I mean, we've
[534.12 --> 540.92]  seen that with the echo chamber effect in the extremely polarized political climate. Um, the more
[540.92 --> 548.60]  that you get sort of pigeonholed as, as you know, one of these or one of those, and you're going to be
[548.60 --> 554.36]  fed more and more of that content, more and more and more of that kind of content to the extremism and
[554.36 --> 558.60]  everything else. And I'm not going to say, you know, you shouldn't be in an open relationship.
[558.60 --> 563.80]  That could be the coolest thing ever. And you could be having your best life. I'm just saying that
[563.80 --> 570.92]  it's not necessarily conducive to really for realsies making your own decisions. If all of a sudden you
[570.92 --> 577.56]  have these tech giants that are going, this is who you are and creating this positive feedback loop that
[577.56 --> 583.00]  might make it hard for you to gain a different perspective. And the same could go the other way.
[583.00 --> 592.28]  I really am not taking a position on that one. It's just kind of, it just feels like a, a disproportionate
[592.28 --> 599.24]  amount of power to give to someone who thinks it's chill to literally try to buy a Hawaiian island,
[599.24 --> 606.52]  you know, do you see that? Like, do you see that? Like what, what even, what even is that? How much of that
[606.52 --> 610.76]  Hawaiian island does he own now? And people are like, just going into it.
[610.76 --> 616.92]  No, there's, there's no issues with, with, with wealth equality at all. Buying like a large chunk
[616.92 --> 622.84]  of a continent is totally fine. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Mark Zuckerberg bought another 600 acres
[623.40 --> 632.04]  on Kauai and Hawaiians are peeved off is the headline. What Hawaiian Island does Zuckerberg own? Yeah, owns,
[632.04 --> 637.48]  purchased close to blah, blah, blah, blah. And they're according to public records. I don't know
[637.48 --> 642.36]  how much of it exactly they own part of the Northeastern part of the garden Island.
[643.56 --> 651.80]  Uh, net worth is whatever, but 700 acres in 2014 for more than a hundred million. Like we're talking,
[651.80 --> 657.48]  we're talking what 1500 acres at this point, somewhere between a thousand, 1500 acres.
[657.48 --> 668.04]  I just, I can't even, I can't even fathom like that much land that you, you couldn't in a day,
[668.04 --> 673.48]  you couldn't walk the entire thing. Not even close. You know what I mean? Like how, how big is Disneyland?
[674.36 --> 681.48]  How big is Disneyland in acres? All right. Okay. Disneyland is a hundred acres. So we're talking
[681.48 --> 690.84]  this enormous, this enormous Hawaiian paradise that is over 10 times the size of Disneyland park. And,
[690.84 --> 699.00]  and my favorite, my favorite thing about this is how, how obvious it is. You know what I mean?
[700.44 --> 705.24]  Like, think about it, Luke, you're Mark Zuckerberg, right? Okay. Yeah.
[705.24 --> 713.00]  Yeah. Your image right now is that you're some kind of lizard person who doesn't really,
[713.00 --> 719.72]  you know, fully understand human emotion. You just try to emulate it and, you know, try not to get
[719.72 --> 725.00]  called in for congressional hearings too often. So you can hang around and do whatever it is that you
[725.00 --> 729.48]  do in your hoodie. To be clear, I'm not, I'm not mocking the CEO hoodie. I rock the CEO hoodie every
[729.48 --> 735.16]  day. I'm super down. Thank you, Mark, for normalizing it. Anyway, the point is, okay. How obvious
[735.16 --> 743.96]  it is, right? Everyone already thinks that you're some kind of alien overlord. So why not just buy a
[743.96 --> 753.40]  Hawaiian island and create a doom fortress? Okay. Yeah. Maybe, maybe he's calling back to his, uh,
[753.40 --> 758.44]  lizard overlords and he's saying, uh, you know, like we don't really need to invade. I could just
[758.44 --> 764.52]  slowly buy the planet. It's fine. It just happened over time. I'm going to start with one of the most
[764.52 --> 770.84]  attractive areas. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Navy retired has, uh, another good one here. Bill Gates
[770.84 --> 775.32]  has almost half of the grazing land in the U S yeah. Bill Gates is buying up farmland
[775.32 --> 782.12]  at just like an astonishing rate. Uh, you know, quietly doing philanthropy or whatever that is.
[782.84 --> 792.04]  Um, but actually, you know, it's kind of funny how someone can be a career philanthropist and be
[792.04 --> 796.44]  richer today than they were when they retired from the head of one of the world's largest companies.
[796.44 --> 801.56]  Like, hold on a second. How does this math work? How are you giving away money? How are you making
[801.56 --> 808.60]  money by giving away money? I don't, I don't think it works that way. The last time I gave away money,
[808.60 --> 813.72]  I'm pretty sure that I didn't get more back in return. That's not giving away money. That's an
[813.72 --> 820.60]  investment. That's not the same thing. I had no idea. This was the thing. Gates owns at least 242,000
[820.60 --> 827.00]  acres of American farmland. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Um, yeah, it's a,
[827.00 --> 831.88]  it's a whole play into like smart farming or something, something, something, and it's all
[831.88 --> 838.20]  being messaged as like a, an investment in sustainability. But the thing about sustainability
[838.20 --> 848.20]  is that, um, it can't be sort of at the, uh, at the, at the will of someone who's in a position of
[848.20 --> 854.84]  kind of unfathomable power, right? Like you're in, I don't know. It's because he wants to ban beef.
[854.84 --> 861.88]  Oh, please. Uh, anyway, why don't we go ahead and move on to our next topic? Um,
[862.68 --> 869.08]  what did we say was going to be our, uh, our, our, our, our, we, we go out of order from,
[869.08 --> 875.08]  Oh, let's do your Disney lightsaber. All right. It's cool. Tell us about it. Tell us about it.
[875.08 --> 883.96]  Uh, so it lights up from its core. So like lights, the, the, the, the toy lightsabers that
[883.96 --> 890.04]  you could buy forever were either always one large piece, like it's always extended and it,
[890.04 --> 895.88]  and it like looks pretty good, but it's always extended. You can't retract it. Um, or they extend,
[895.88 --> 900.68]  but they only glow from the base. So they kind of look like junk, but at least they extend it. So
[900.68 --> 908.28]  they're often more fun to play with. Um, this one lights up from its core. As far as I, I, I looked
[908.28 --> 911.96]  at some stuff on Twitter about how people think it works and all this kind of stuff. And as far as
[911.96 --> 917.40]  my understanding goes, it's essentially a chain of LEDs, um, that gets unraveled along with the
[917.40 --> 924.28]  tube when it goes up, but like the, the realistic level just got massively cranked up. Um, really cool.
[924.28 --> 928.68]  That video apparently doesn't have any special effects. That's just what the lightsaber looks like,
[928.68 --> 933.16]  which is pretty wicked. Yeah. So this is, this is what, this is how they think it works.
[934.92 --> 942.36]  That's pretty cool. Pretty wicked. I could be, I could be pretty into that. Um, at a recent virtual
[942.36 --> 948.12]  press conference, Disney parks, chairman, Josh Jamarro, um, briefly revealed what onlookers have
[948.12 --> 953.96]  called a real lightsaber after studying the patent. Wow. Okay. That's pretty cool.
[953.96 --> 961.48]  Cool. It's like actually pretty wicked. It's like this chain, chain of LEDs that goes out. Um,
[961.48 --> 967.56]  apparently there is no current notable, like we are going to sell this thing. Uh, some people are
[967.56 --> 972.36]  thinking they're going to keep it to themselves for a little while to help promote the, the star Wars
[972.36 --> 977.64]  experience that that's happening down there. Um, and then maybe it'll, it'll be for sale in like a
[977.64 --> 981.72]  couple or a few years or something like that. So they can keep the hype around the experience for a while.
[981.72 --> 987.24]  Right. Yeah. Because star Wars is about keeping hype, not rebuilding it right now.
[991.48 --> 995.88]  Oh boy. I'm sorry. Is there star Wars hype right now? Luke helped me out here.
[996.44 --> 999.24]  I haven't watched it yet, but I've heard good things about bad batch.
[1000.04 --> 1004.04]  Okay. All right. It's all the side content. It's not the, the mainline movies are just,
[1004.68 --> 1009.48]  I mean, they've become terrible, right? Like the sequel series is horrible, but, um,
[1009.48 --> 1016.44]  the side content's been pretty all right. Yeah. Um, no idea how sturdy it's going to be. I mean,
[1016.44 --> 1021.80]  that's a major concern. If the idea is just to like hold it and wave it around and look like a
[1021.80 --> 1029.00]  badass, then that's somewhat cool. But if they're actually rugged enough that you could even whack
[1029.00 --> 1034.92]  them a little, that would be next level. I mean, that's the kind of thing that people will literally
[1034.92 --> 1041.16]  wait five hours in line so they can pose in a selfie or like, uh, maybe not a selfie, but you
[1041.16 --> 1048.84]  know, post a story or whatever else, like 15 seconds of them and their SO, you know, igniting lightsabers.
[1048.84 --> 1057.00]  And then, you know, um, yeah, that looks like lots of fun. Uh, one of our other topics for the day is
[1057.00 --> 1065.56]  did Tesla buy Gigabyte? Gigabyte now has pre-built on their website called the Model X and Model S.
[1065.56 --> 1072.20]  And if these don't look like cars, I'm going to be extremely disappointed. Uh, let's go ahead and fire
[1072.20 --> 1075.80]  this up. Not even remotely, just to spoil your day. Wow.
[1075.80 --> 1080.84]  Wow. My, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
[1082.60 --> 1091.16]  So it's a 12 core 5900 X with a 3080 graphics card. Where's my gullwing doors? Okay. Hold on a
[1091.16 --> 1101.16]  second design concept. We looked at a car and we got as far as the name and then we got bored and made a
[1101.16 --> 1110.60]  computer case. Got it. Thank you. Um, okay. Air in the front and out the top and the back. That's
[1110.60 --> 1117.16]  an innovation. RGB. That's new expansion. Okay. In all seriousness, it looks fine. It's just,
[1118.60 --> 1120.20]  why is it called the Model X?
[1120.20 --> 1124.92]  Why is it not though? Like, that's what I'm like. Does it matter? I don't know.
[1124.92 --> 1130.12]  Okay. Fine. Model. I mean, X has been done. X has been done for years in the PC hardware space.
[1130.12 --> 1134.28]  X and S have both been done in the PC hardware space. When has S been done?
[1135.96 --> 1141.96]  Okay. Maybe that's more of a car thing. Oh yeah. Cars, you know, S whatever, S class, whatever.
[1141.96 --> 1149.56]  S has been on the edge of Nvidia stuff sometimes. Because there's been GT, GTX, GTS. Okay. All right. That's true.
[1149.56 --> 1154.52]  But I think it's definitely not very common. I will. Yeah. I think the GT was like the kind of the
[1154.52 --> 1161.48]  performance part. And then X was just like X for extreme. And then S is just like, oh crap. Um, okay.
[1161.48 --> 1166.84]  But less extreme than that, you know, super or supreme or whatever you want to call it. Now, for my part,
[1166.84 --> 1172.68]  if I was looking at sort of the design story of these, I would go, um, how did this end up being
[1172.68 --> 1181.24]  called Model S because it looks just like an Xbox Series X? Yeah. That's actually a good point.
[1181.24 --> 1186.68]  Flip the names around guys to do better. Yeah. Come on guys. Oh, hold on. Actually, hold on. There
[1186.68 --> 1193.40]  we go. So it uses the same kind of. So in the chat, pointed out, uh, Xbox Series S.
[1194.60 --> 1198.52]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Xbox Series S. That's, that's true. That's true.
[1198.52 --> 1202.52]  Samsung Galaxy S 2070 S.
[1202.52 --> 1209.80]  Um, okay. 2070 S is short for super and the S is for silent in the define S.
[1210.92 --> 1216.52]  This is pretty cool. So they've, um, they've managed to rip off the name of a Tesla car,
[1216.52 --> 1223.96]  the form factor of a Microsoft game console and the cooling of the Mac trash can. It's not triangular.
[1223.96 --> 1229.24]  So it's only a, like a sandwich style from two sides. You can see here, you got your graphics
[1229.24 --> 1233.24]  card over here and your motherboard over here, but that should actually work really well. Having a
[1233.24 --> 1241.80]  shared heat sink. Apple has shown us works way better than you would necessarily think like you,
[1241.80 --> 1248.92]  instead of, yeah. With all the crimes that have happened in, in model names for, for hardware,
[1248.92 --> 1255.08]  do they deserve, do they deserve this braiding attack we've given them? Because I don't really
[1255.08 --> 1261.24]  think so. I think this is fine. I think blatantly naming your computers after cars that they have
[1261.24 --> 1268.76]  nothing to do. Okay. It's not like, it's not like Tesla is some regional car brand or something.
[1268.76 --> 1276.12]  It's not like, you know, some, that part of the world, nobody has ever heard of Tesla and, or,
[1276.12 --> 1280.44]  or the car has a different name, you know, like you, you've seen that before in the past, right? Like
[1280.44 --> 1288.52]  the, um, Oh, the Suzuki Swift was also the Pontiac Firefly was also the Geo Metro. They were all the
[1288.52 --> 1293.56]  same car, but it might've varied depending on the region or depending on the manufacturer that was
[1293.56 --> 1299.48]  using the same, uh, the same platform. Right. Yeah. But that's not the case here. There could,
[1299.48 --> 1306.12]  there could conceivably be people in Gigabyte's native Taiwan that, you know, drive home from work
[1306.12 --> 1312.68]  in their model S and then go up to their apartment and play games on their model S. And that's just
[1315.40 --> 1320.44]  and then, and then when they're done, go back and get in their car and play games on their model S.
[1320.44 --> 1330.52]  Hey, because you can play, you can play games in a Tesla. That was the joke. So yes, I think,
[1330.52 --> 1337.08]  I think they deserve it. Not because it's offensive or anything, but because it's just really, really
[1337.08 --> 1343.08]  stupid. That's why, that's why. If they put a different word that if they used X and S,
[1343.08 --> 1345.88]  but put like, I was going to say series, but Microsoft.
[1345.88 --> 1349.88]  Yeah.
[1349.88 --> 1355.08]  Independently come up with pretty much the dumbest names Microsoft's ever had for a console, which is
[1355.08 --> 1360.04]  truly, which is truly a spectacular achievement. Yeah. Yeah.
[1360.04 --> 1366.52]  How do they keep getting worse at it? I just don't understand it. Sony set the bar so low.
[1366.52 --> 1373.24]  Yeah. Our game console one, two, three, four, five. And there, okay. There was some,
[1373.24 --> 1380.52]  there was some messy stuff in there, you know, retroactively now that's PS X. And also there's
[1380.52 --> 1386.04]  the PS one, but like, like, like O N E it's really small, you know, like there was definitely
[1386.04 --> 1391.72]  some dumb stuff in there from Sony, but truly nothing even close to Microsoft's nonsense.
[1391.72 --> 1395.32]  I haven't followed PlayStation enough. I knew about like the slim additions and stuff like that,
[1395.32 --> 1400.20]  but I didn't, I didn't know about the one and stuff. That's, that's sad to hear that they went
[1400.20 --> 1405.80]  that direction. Oh yeah. That thing was super cool though. I remember my first time seeing it,
[1405.80 --> 1413.16]  this is hilarious. My first time seeing it was actually at, um, at Ikea and it was just like one
[1413.16 --> 1418.60]  of the cardboard fake ones. And I had only ever seen it online. So I didn't realize like how small it is,
[1418.60 --> 1424.04]  but here, here, I'm showing my display capture. Oh, right. I forgot about the one with the built-in
[1424.04 --> 1430.04]  display, the PS one combo. I just found that. Yeah. What the heck? That's kind of awesome.
[1430.04 --> 1434.52]  Yeah. And then that thing was, that thing was super cool. Like there's the PS one combo, uh,
[1435.08 --> 1438.92]  right next to a controller, which gives you a really good idea of the scale of it.
[1438.92 --> 1444.60]  We actually have one of them kicking around the office. I think our intention was to like build it
[1444.60 --> 1449.08]  into something like we wanted to do like an ultimate PlayStation and it was just going to
[1449.08 --> 1453.64]  have like all the PlayStations built into one chassis. Cause you don't even have to have that
[1453.64 --> 1459.56]  many of them. You just have to have a PS three with the, um, with the hardware backwards compatible.
[1459.56 --> 1466.28]  So one of the like, one of the launch PS threes and then a PS four and PS five all cooked into one
[1466.28 --> 1470.36]  thing, but this was pre PS five. So it was just going to be two boxes, but then there was some reason
[1470.36 --> 1474.60]  we wanted the PS one. I don't, I don't, I don't remember what it was. It was probably,
[1474.60 --> 1479.88]  it was probably dumb, which is probably why we never did it. What can I say?
[1481.72 --> 1486.84]  Uh, what else we got today? That's a really, really compelling news that we definitely need
[1486.84 --> 1491.32]  to talk to you guys about airbag. I think we could jump to the airbag. You know what? Let's talk about
[1491.32 --> 1498.28]  the airbag. This is some dystopian level right here. Like, I don't even know. I don't even know what my
[1498.28 --> 1503.96]  stance is on this. Go ahead and hit me. So a motorcycle apparel company named Klim,
[1503.96 --> 1509.64]  I believe that's how you say it, uh, sells an airbag vest. So a vest that you wear while you're
[1509.64 --> 1515.72]  on your motorcycle called the AI one for $400. And, but these are totally a thing. Actually,
[1515.72 --> 1522.28]  I first learned about these for, or like, like high tech wearable, like safety equipment. Um,
[1522.28 --> 1527.40]  when I was at a snowboard shop and they showed me this backpack and I was like,
[1528.20 --> 1533.72]  what the hell is it about this backpack that could make it be worth like a thousand dollars or
[1533.72 --> 1538.84]  something like that? And they're like, oh, it has like an emergency avalanche deployment,
[1538.84 --> 1543.88]  inflatable thing. Yeah. The, yeah. The balloon thing. Yeah. So we can like find you and stuff.
[1543.88 --> 1547.48]  So people can like find you and it gives you enough air to breathe. And I was like, oh, okay,
[1547.48 --> 1552.12]  I guess so. The, the sales rep was really rude. Like treated me like I was some kind of complete
[1552.12 --> 1559.24]  idiot for not thinking that avalanche preparedness was important. I was like, no, you jerk. I just
[1559.24 --> 1565.48]  didn't know that that's what it does. Obviously. Otherwise I wouldn't be like, why does this backpack
[1565.48 --> 1569.72]  cost a thousand dollars anyway? Uh, yeah, go, go ahead. I'm sorry. I totally cut you off there.
[1569.72 --> 1576.76]  No, no worries. Uh, so yeah, when you buy it for, with $400, uh, it does nothing at all that you are,
[1576.76 --> 1581.88]  you are not done. You need to continue spending money. Uh, you, you have to activate the vest in
[1581.88 --> 1588.36]  a companion app. No, no, no, no, wait, you buy it for $400. You, you, uh, it's, you need to buy it
[1588.36 --> 1593.96]  for an, oh, yep. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you buy it for 400 bucks and you know what?
[1595.00 --> 1600.68]  I don't actually know. Maybe there's some amount of time included. I don't know that part, but it is
[1600.68 --> 1606.44]  timed. So you need to lease it, lease the functionality of it. Cause you've bought the hardware,
[1606.44 --> 1610.92]  I guess. And it does nothing for $400 after whatever your trial period is.
[1610.92 --> 1619.72]  Yeah. So you lease it for, uh, $12 a month to $120 a year, or you pay another $400, doubling the cost
[1619.72 --> 1626.84]  to 800 total dollars, uh, to, to just buy it outright and have it work forever. Okay. And the idea is that
[1626.84 --> 1634.12]  this airbag vest inflates if you fall effectively kind of trying to keep you safe. If you, if you crash
[1634.12 --> 1637.64]  for motorcycle. And this tech, like this tech works, they, they have a bunch of different
[1637.64 --> 1643.32]  examples of this. Um, there was, I think we talked about it on a WAN show, like a, a few years ago,
[1643.32 --> 1647.32]  there was a helmet, um, which is, which was essentially, I think it was like built into your
[1647.32 --> 1652.04]  jacket or something. And then if you fell on a bicycle, it wasn't designed for a motorcycle.
[1652.04 --> 1656.76]  If you fell on a bicycle, it would inflate and wrap around your head. Um, which would,
[1656.76 --> 1664.76]  I think some like students from somewhere made it. Um, yeah, very interesting. I, what keeps getting
[1664.76 --> 1669.16]  me is like my, my credit card expired a while back and there was like a couple of different
[1669.16 --> 1676.04]  services that I forgot to update. Sure. Um, and they like, I guess they emailed me, but I don't
[1676.04 --> 1681.24]  really check my personal email that often. Right. I don't really use my personal email for very many
[1681.24 --> 1689.00]  things to be completely honest. I basically just checked my work ones. Um, and it just, the, the,
[1689.00 --> 1692.36]  the service stopped working. I was like, what the heck, what's going on? And then I figured out,
[1692.36 --> 1698.68]  oh, I need to update my credit card. If that happens with this, you die. Well, there's a 30 day
[1698.68 --> 1705.64]  grace period. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I guess. But past the 30 day grace period, you,
[1705.64 --> 1716.04]  you, I literally would be wearing a $400 accessory that does not work and will not deploy. And you
[1716.04 --> 1722.92]  would actually potentially, if not die, like it may not be the difference between life and death,
[1722.92 --> 1728.84]  but it could be the difference between levels of injury. Um, and so here's, this is a direct quote
[1728.84 --> 1732.76]  from the company. It's like a guaranteed death if it doesn't deploy. I guess I was a little bit too
[1732.76 --> 1738.04]  hardcore there, but yeah. If customers choose to ignore the indicators and ride with inbox,
[1738.04 --> 1744.04]  is that what it's called? Inactive. That's on them. And we can expect it not to inflate in the
[1744.04 --> 1749.48]  event of a crash. So imagine, I mean, it's one of those things where, okay, I understand that their
[1749.48 --> 1755.64]  business model is to be paid for their product. Obviously, right? Like if you don't pay for the
[1755.64 --> 1762.52]  product, then you shouldn't have the product. But then imagine for a second, being the person
[1762.52 --> 1769.64]  who like, let's, let's do, let's talk a hypothetical, right? You can freeze time. So you're watching,
[1769.64 --> 1776.92]  okay? You're watching this happen. Someone gets like, someone gets the back of their motorcycle clipped
[1776.92 --> 1782.28]  as they go through an intersection and the bike is wobbling, right? And they're heading into a turn
[1782.28 --> 1789.40]  and they're gonna, they're gonna slam into like a solid object. Basically, it's gonna happen. Okay?
[1789.40 --> 1797.56]  Time is frozen. And you have the option to, for $400, save them.
[1798.52 --> 1803.96]  And you go, I don't know, they probably should have paid the $400 ahead of time.
[1803.96 --> 1805.32]  That's on them.
[1805.32 --> 1805.40]  That's on them.
[1807.08 --> 1808.76]  Do you, would you think it's better?
[1809.96 --> 1816.68]  Imagine being the kind of sociopath that's like, because I could, okay, I could see them
[1816.68 --> 1821.40]  having it inflate anyway, and then sending collections after you or something.
[1821.40 --> 1826.12]  Okay, so that's what I was gonna say. Do you think it would be better if it does inflate anyways,
[1826.12 --> 1827.96]  but it costs $800?
[1832.36 --> 1841.16]  Oh, interesting. So you have to pay a like lapsed subscription fee if it goes off. So it's more like
[1841.88 --> 1849.16]  paying for going off insurance and less like actually paying for the raw functionality.
[1849.16 --> 1853.08]  They still save your life, but they're, they're kind of like, hey, dude, what the heck? Like,
[1853.08 --> 1857.40]  you weren't paying your after active subscription. We, we saved you out of the
[1859.56 --> 1865.24]  money grabbing part of our hearts. You owe us a bunch of money. Would that be better to you?
[1865.24 --> 1868.76]  Way better. Way better. Way better. Because to me, it just comes down to-
[1868.76 --> 1871.72]  Especially if that was clearly communicated that that's how that would work, right?
[1871.72 --> 1878.68]  Because the software has a moment. Like this product has an opportunity, mom's spaghetti,
[1878.68 --> 1886.04]  to save someone or let them potentially be horribly injured or get dead. This is a paying customer.
[1886.04 --> 1891.88]  And that's something that's just really, really frustrating to me about the whole internet of
[1891.88 --> 1899.32]  things, buy once, pay forever kind of model is just because someone didn't, you know, buy it and
[1899.32 --> 1906.68]  give you their money exactly the way that you like them to or enough. Doesn't make them not a paying
[1906.68 --> 1911.16]  customer all of a sudden. You can't just completely ignore them and treat them like garbage. Literally
[1911.16 --> 1911.88]  let them die.
[1911.88 --> 1916.68]  Yeah. It's super awesome.
[1918.28 --> 1923.00]  Thomas goth town. He says, if you've paid for the product, shouldn't it just bloody work? Okay. So
[1923.00 --> 1929.32]  that's where you get into the economics of, you know, functionality as a DLC, right? Because
[1929.96 --> 1935.48]  here's the opposite or here's the counter argument to that, right? Let's say in order for them to make
[1935.48 --> 1942.04]  enough margin on this product, their actual target sell price would have to be, let's say $650. Okay.
[1942.04 --> 1948.76]  So somewhere between the buy outright price of $800 and the lease forever price, or actually, okay,
[1948.76 --> 1952.52]  the way that math would work would probably be the other way. The buy outright price is probably like
[1952.52 --> 1958.04]  the bulk price or whatever, because people would be expected to use this thing for years and years,
[1958.04 --> 1963.96]  right? So let's say they're break even break even where they're actually profitable is like $900 or
[1963.96 --> 1968.36]  something. So here's my counter argument. If you only need this thing, let's say you live somewhere like,
[1968.36 --> 1974.36]  oh, I don't know, Vancouver, British Columbia, right? Like me. If you only need this thing for like
[1974.36 --> 1982.12]  four months out of the year, then it would be kind of great if all the people who buy it outright
[1982.52 --> 1989.80]  could subsidize you only needing to pay $400 upfront, which, you know, maybe wasn't enough for them to
[1989.80 --> 1994.84]  to make the margin that they needed to make to be profitable. And then, you know, slowly pay, you know,
[1994.84 --> 2000.04]  whatever that would work out to you, like about 48 to $60 a year over the next five to 10 years.
[2000.04 --> 2007.24]  Ultimately, that could be more, more sensible and affordable. I could take that $400 I didn't spend
[2007.24 --> 2012.60]  up front or given I'm going to presumably use it for the first season, that 350 or so dollars that
[2012.60 --> 2018.28]  I didn't spend up front, and I could put it in an index fund or something. And ultimately, if I am
[2018.28 --> 2025.24]  excellent at managing my money, I could actually come out ahead with this, you know, leasing option. I could,
[2025.24 --> 2030.12]  I could save money. And the people who buy it outright, actually, okay, I probably got the math
[2030.12 --> 2036.68]  wrong. It doesn't matter. The people who buy it outright, or the people who can't afford the upfront,
[2036.68 --> 2041.00]  but can afford the subscription 12 months a year forever, because they're not good at managing their
[2041.00 --> 2047.24]  money, like they could, they can subsidize me. That's the argument. And you end up in these same
[2047.24 --> 2053.88]  kinds of conversations when you talk about things like the, the heated rear seats in the Model 3,
[2053.88 --> 2059.24]  I think is the one where it kind of broke news, where they build it into every single car, and then you
[2059.24 --> 2065.16]  activate it after the fact, because for Tesla, it's more economical from a manufacturing standpoint to
[2065.16 --> 2072.12]  just put it in every car. But it does have an actual cost. So the people who want it can subsidize that
[2072.12 --> 2076.92]  manufacturing cost, and they end up paying a bit extra. But that way, the people who don't want it can save a
[2076.92 --> 2082.04]  buck. But then from my point of view, if you're claiming that your company is all about saving the planet, then you
[2082.04 --> 2088.60]  just shouldn't consume materials that you're not planning to actually, you know, activate or do
[2088.60 --> 2092.44]  something with or whatever the case may be. And to be clear, because I think I think some people in
[2092.44 --> 2097.64]  the chat are getting off base here, they have an option, you can just pay 800 bucks more or less up
[2097.64 --> 2102.60]  front. Absolutely. It works forever. Something else that might be going on here and something that might
[2102.60 --> 2111.56]  muddy the waters here as well is like, this is a apparel company. This is a pretty high tech device. Yep. They
[2111.56 --> 2118.44]  might not have done any of the software for this. So they might have to pay like a licensing fee for
[2118.44 --> 2126.60]  each user. That this detection of collision, whatever stuff is running on. So they might like,
[2127.96 --> 2132.28]  they might have to pay out of pocket monthly for each one of these users. So they need a monthly
[2134.76 --> 2139.40]  thing for it. But then that doesn't make a ton of sense, because you can pay 400 upfront. But maybe
[2139.40 --> 2143.64]  there's a way that they can buy out a user, blah, blah, blah. I don't know. It depends on like,
[2143.64 --> 2149.40]  what kind of fees are going on in the background. But yeah, it's, uh, so
[2152.44 --> 2155.96]  says after paying the subscription on the Klim for three to four years, you don't need to pay the
[2155.96 --> 2160.84]  subscription anymore. So it's more like a, it's more like a financing option then. So I'm guessing you
[2160.84 --> 2166.44]  pay just a little bit extra that way. So their target would then be $800. I,
[2169.16 --> 2172.60]  I don't know, man. I don't know what to tell you. I think there's a better solution.
[2172.60 --> 2179.16]  On the one hand, I'm in favor of making the barrier to entry for life saving technology lower.
[2179.16 --> 2187.64]  So if Klim says, okay, by making it cost $400 and then be $120 a year, we are able to get this into the
[2187.64 --> 2193.16]  hands of people who would otherwise have to save up for longer in order to have it. Maybe they die
[2193.16 --> 2197.72]  while they're saving up their money, right? You can make that argument. There could be lives being
[2197.72 --> 2204.04]  saved by them having a lower barrier to entry. But then the flip side of it being just like,
[2204.04 --> 2207.80]  well, yeah, I don't know. It's not on until you die. Um, I don't think that's really the
[2207.80 --> 2213.16]  right solution either. I think having it activate and then going after you with a penalty is probably the,
[2213.88 --> 2219.64]  the not morally reprehensible way to handle this. What about, what about another option where there's,
[2219.64 --> 2227.40]  there's only two ways to pay. There's the 400 upfront, or if you agree to the $120 a year or
[2227.40 --> 2234.84]  $12 a month thing, you have to lock in for four years so that they get their money.
[2234.84 --> 2239.40]  Yeah. But the thing is like what the, the edge case we're talking about here that we started with
[2239.40 --> 2244.12]  was, you know, maybe, um, losing or canceling your credit card. So just cause you're locked
[2244.12 --> 2248.68]  in doesn't mean they can actually get the money from you. And that's exactly the kind of situation
[2248.68 --> 2254.68]  where you might end up dying. Now to be clear, it's, it'll light up and tell you that it's, that
[2254.68 --> 2261.48]  it's activated. But I mean, I don't know, man, I know a lot of people who don't pay that close
[2261.48 --> 2267.48]  attention. We're talking this high technology app controlled vest and I don't want to generalize,
[2267.48 --> 2276.36]  but like bikers are not necessarily the youngest, most tech savvy people all the time. Um, I mean,
[2276.36 --> 2279.80]  I thought motorcycles are one of those things that millennials are killing.
[2281.32 --> 2283.08]  That's the, what's the latest thing?
[2283.08 --> 2283.40]  They probably are.
[2283.40 --> 2285.48]  Millennial. Apparently millennials are killing Coca-Cola.
[2285.48 --> 2287.80]  Yeah. That's yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
[2287.80 --> 2292.04]  Which is great. Like, heck yeah. Let's get rid of it. Good job.
[2292.04 --> 2299.00]  Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Luke. That's a very controversial take. I don't want to kill Coca-Cola.
[2299.00 --> 2302.36]  I need, you know, I I'm, I'm super into that Coca-Cola.
[2302.36 --> 2303.48]  Why? Are you?
[2303.48 --> 2309.32]  Well, not the North American swill that we, that we can buy, but the man, the sugar cane Coke.
[2309.32 --> 2315.32]  So good. So good. I'm like, I'm lucky I don't live somewhere where you can actually buy
[2315.32 --> 2316.20]  good Coca-Cola.
[2318.92 --> 2320.28]  Yeah. I heard like some.
[2328.52 --> 2331.56]  There's some weird stuff here on Coca-Cola. I don't want to necessarily say things on the
[2331.56 --> 2335.80]  WAN show because I don't know how much of it is like true necessarily or whatnot.
[2338.04 --> 2340.60]  So yeah, I don't really want to go into it, but I heard something about.
[2340.60 --> 2346.44]  Yeah. I actually don't want to go into it at all, but you can look up like weird things
[2346.44 --> 2351.64]  with Coca-Cola and there's some really odd stuff with them needing to potentially pay like $500
[2351.64 --> 2354.52]  million in a lawsuit because of deaths.
[2354.52 --> 2359.32]  Oh, and death squads. Look up Coca-Cola death squads.
[2360.68 --> 2361.40]  Find some stuff.
[2361.40 --> 2363.08]  That sounds like a heck of a rabbit hole.
[2363.72 --> 2366.76]  I don't know if it ended up. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I just,
[2366.76 --> 2371.08]  I had a Google news thing pop up on my phone this morning saying that like millennials,
[2371.08 --> 2374.84]  millennials canceled it because of that. And I was like, what are you talking about?
[2374.84 --> 2376.52]  No, never heard of this before.
[2376.52 --> 2382.60]  It probably has more to do with it just not being trendy. Like when's the last time you were like,
[2382.60 --> 2384.44]  oh yeah, Coke is, that's a cool drink.
[2385.08 --> 2390.28]  Well, everyone knows that Nestle is doing like tons of like super evil things and people still
[2390.28 --> 2394.20]  buy Nestle products all the time. So it would definitely be because it's not trendy.
[2394.20 --> 2397.00]  Oh yeah. I mean, I don't think, I don't think there's anything,
[2397.00 --> 2400.52]  I don't think there's anything the Coca-Cola company could do to be more evil than Nestle.
[2401.32 --> 2404.60]  That's a pretty, that's a pretty high bar right there.
[2404.60 --> 2406.44]  The show is also brought to you by Ridge Wallet.
[2406.92 --> 2409.80]  Stop carrying around pointless items in your pocket, like receipts,

[2457.72 --> 2462.44]  Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we did not have a budget to build those websites and did not
[2462.44 --> 2468.20]  have a lot of time. And with Squarespace, we were up and running basically right away.
[2468.20 --> 2473.40]  You can choose from any of their gorgeous templates and they'll work awesome on desktop, mobile, or,

[2495.16 --> 2504.12]  We got some other good topics to talk about today. Epic versus apples. Epic Sega continues. Epic,
[2504.12 --> 2510.36]  Epic versus apples. I want to address the Coke thing really quick. I looked it up. It was thrown out of
[2510.36 --> 2514.92]  court due to lack of evidence. Due to lack of evidence. All right. Yeah. So who knows?
[2514.92 --> 2521.40]  So who knows if they tried to organize any kind of hit men things?
[2521.40 --> 2529.48]  Stuff. Yeah. Moving on. Moving on. Epic versus apple this Monday,
[2529.48 --> 2534.60]  May 3rd marked the start of the epic versus apple trial, but didn't start out smoothly.
[2534.60 --> 2541.16]  Fans of both parties. Oh no. Found the call in number and interrupted the proceedings before the
[2541.16 --> 2547.56]  court got things under control. The call-ins were somewhat amusing, but they were disruptive.
[2547.56 --> 2553.88]  Please don't do that. One of the key arguments that Apple is making concerns Microsoft and Xbox. And when
[2553.88 --> 2559.72]  I say Xbox, there's a reason that I didn't get specific because Xbox for Microsoft has become
[2560.52 --> 2569.00]  kind of a muddy term. Luke, what is Xbox? It's like everything Microsoft does in regards to gaming.
[2569.00 --> 2578.60]  Okay. So it's not a console anymore. It's not a store. It's not an, um, oh man, do they call the-
[2578.60 --> 2583.72]  An application on your computer. Yeah. Yeah. It's not just an application on your computer. It's like-
[2583.72 --> 2587.24]  It's not being able to play games through the cloud. Yeah. It's-
[2587.24 --> 2592.28]  It's all of these things together. It's all of it together. Uh, so anyway, uh, one of the arguments that
[2592.28 --> 2598.92]  Apple's making is about Microsoft and Xbox are saying that Mac OS and windows are both open desktop
[2598.92 --> 2606.12]  operating systems while iOS and Xbox are closed specialized operating systems. And they both feature
[2606.12 --> 2611.40]  a 70, 30 revenue split on digital purchases. So therefore, because Microsoft is doing it,
[2611.40 --> 2618.44]  it cannot be evil and cannot violate antitrust law. So it must be okay for us to do it too.
[2620.12 --> 2626.12]  And okay. I made up that last bit. Epic's counter argument. Xbox consoles are sold at a loss. Digital
[2626.12 --> 2632.68]  purchases are their only profit generator for the platform. Also, incidentally, Microsoft recently cut
[2633.24 --> 2640.04]  their take on games on the Microsoft store to 12%, uh, presumably as a response to competition in the
[2640.04 --> 2648.20]  market from the likes of, well, Epic games. Epic argues that the iPhone is more like a PC than a
[2648.20 --> 2655.00]  specialized gaming console that is sold for the purposes of having people subscribe to gaming
[2655.00 --> 2660.28]  services and buy games to run on it. So the app store business model should be more like the Microsoft
[2660.28 --> 2666.20]  store, the Epic game store, or even Mac OS where apps can be installed from anywhere. All right. Pretty
[2666.20 --> 2671.40]  solid argument. I think we probably saw this one coming also released court documents have revealed
[2671.40 --> 2677.56]  some interesting things in 2011, Apple discussed reducing the app store, Apple tax, Phil Schiller,
[2677.56 --> 2682.44]  head of the app store emailed Eddie Q and Steve jobs saying, once we are making over a billion dollars
[2682.44 --> 2688.44]  a year in profit from the app store, is that enough to then think about a model where we ratchet down from
[2688.44 --> 2695.16]  70, 30 to 75, 25, or even 80, 20. If we can maintain a billion dollar a year run rate.
[2696.20 --> 2699.80]  You know what? I never knew that Phil Schiller was so cool.
[2701.80 --> 2709.80]  Like, come on guys. Come on guys. A billion dollars a year run rate. That seems pretty good.
[2709.80 --> 2715.16]  Maybe we could just, maybe we could just like make a cool billion dollars a year and that'd be like,
[2715.16 --> 2719.56]  chill, right? It's all good. We don't need more than a billion dollars a year from,
[2719.56 --> 2725.00]  you know, app developers. Nope. Not good enough. Yes, they do. Yes, they do.
[2726.44 --> 2733.24]  Uh, Microsoft inadvertently got shadow kicked from the app store. They emailed Apple asking how shadow
[2733.24 --> 2738.44]  could be in the app store, but xCloud couldn't. And shortly afterwards shadows iOS app was suddenly
[2738.44 --> 2745.32]  suspended. Um, shadow came back, but was suspended a year later in February, 2021 shadow says that Apple
[2745.32 --> 2749.72]  didn't understand that they stream a full windows PC rather than a library of games.
[2750.28 --> 2756.52]  Luke, I'm not surprised. Hold on a second. I find that very difficult to believe because,
[2756.52 --> 2766.04]  because Apple's adjudicators and reviewers for the app store, um, are very, very well versed.
[2766.04 --> 2774.52]  Um, no, no, no, they're very well versed in all the different subtleties of the differences in
[2774.52 --> 2779.48]  functionalities between apps. They're very thorough. They offer prompt communication.
[2781.32 --> 2787.88]  They do offer a fairly, uh, if they don't need to do anything and they can just say no,
[2788.60 --> 2793.80]  they do tend to offer pretty prompt communication. If there's any actionable items or they maybe need to
[2793.80 --> 2800.44]  say yes, or they need to actually do their jobs in any way that could take a bit longer. But, um,
[2800.44 --> 2804.60]  yeah, just saying no screw off that, that does tend to happen fairly quick.
[2805.24 --> 2809.08]  Uh, in other news, Tim Sweeney thinks Epic game store will be profitable
[2809.08 --> 2815.24]  and make up 35 to 50% of the PC gaming market by 2024.
[2815.24 --> 2823.72]  And there's a, there's a note on here that says LOL. Okay. But I would argue if they continue their
[2823.72 --> 2831.24]  hyper aggressive spend to give away free games, he might be right. Tell me something, Luke. Yeah.
[2832.92 --> 2840.36]  How many Epic game store games do you have installed right now? None. Okay. Ask me something, Luke.
[2840.36 --> 2846.28]  But I don't think you and I are. No, go ahead and ask me. No, you have to ask me. All right, Linus. Yeah.
[2846.28 --> 2850.12]  How many Epic game store games do you have installed? Hold on. Let me find out. I don't really know the answer.
[2851.32 --> 2858.60]  Uh, it's hard to tell because, um, in order to check that I would have to open the launcher,
[2858.60 --> 2861.16]  which I don't appear to have installed. Team EBGA is in the chat. What's up, guys?
[2861.88 --> 2868.84]  Who's in the chat? Team EBGA. Oh, sup, y'all? Your thing was, uh, your thing was yesterday, dog.
[2870.36 --> 2875.80]  Or, uh, before that or something? I don't know. I can't, I can't remember. Um,
[2875.80 --> 2879.32]  It was yesterday. Yeah. Was it yesterday? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. This week's,
[2879.32 --> 2888.20]  this week's been a blur, man. Um, so I, I wish, I wish Mr. Sweeney luck with that. I don't necessarily
[2888.20 --> 2895.56]  think that it's going to play out exactly like that. I think, I think there is an extremely large
[2895.56 --> 2901.00]  amount of people who played Fortnite and therefore got used to the Epic games launcher. I think there
[2901.00 --> 2905.00]  are an extremely large amount of people that still play Fortnite because it's still a very popular
[2905.00 --> 2911.48]  game, not at its peak anymore, but it's still huge. Uh, and I think if they keep giving away stuff like
[2911.48 --> 2918.28]  GTA, Civ, all these like major titles that people play, they keep pushing that. I think adoption is
[2918.28 --> 2924.12]  going to be really high. And when he said profitable and market share. Oh, did he say
[2924.12 --> 2927.64]  profitable? No, he said both. Okay. All right.
[2931.00 --> 2934.04]  Now I understand why you were making the argument you were making.
[2935.16 --> 2939.80]  You were like, yeah, totally. They can, they can buy 50% of like,
[2940.44 --> 2947.48]  that's what Val's business. As long as they actually give it away. Yes. Yes. You're right. They could do that.
[2948.60 --> 2951.96]  All right. Well, the combination of that's a little tough. Good luck.
[2953.48 --> 2958.68]  I don't know. He also said PC gaming market. Yeah. All right.
[2960.52 --> 2966.20]  Roll that one back a little bit. Anyway, uh, in other news, what else we got here?
[2966.20 --> 2975.08]  Uh, oh, there's a discount code, right? We have a promo. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Oh, are you,
[2975.08 --> 2984.20]  are you serious right now? Uh, okay. So if you go on LTT store.com right now, there's a very nice
[2985.32 --> 2992.84]  promo code. It's nice. It's nice. Uh, so if you use promo code, nice, then you will get,
[2993.56 --> 2997.16]  actually, I forget what exactly the promo is. Hold on. Let me go back to this. What did,
[2997.16 --> 3007.00]  okay. You will get free shipping. This is worldwide free shipping on orders of $69 and 69 cents or more.
[3007.80 --> 3012.84]  So it's only going to be live for a couple of hours. Uh, I don't know exactly how long it'll turn
[3012.84 --> 3018.44]  off whenever Nick gets tired of thinking about it in the back of his mind and making sure we
[3018.44 --> 3023.48]  don't completely lose our shirts. Uh, free shipping like costs when it's worldwide.
[3023.48 --> 3028.20]  Cause you never know when someone in from like is Pakistan or something is going to order like
[3028.20 --> 3033.16]  a flat of water bottles for them and their entire extended family. And it's like, Oh, um,
[3033.16 --> 3039.96]  Hmm. Thank you for your order. That will be now, you know, $270 in shipping charges that we get to eat
[3039.96 --> 3044.84]  now. Um, so, you know, we always like to, whenever we do free shipping, we always try to be really
[3044.84 --> 3053.40]  careful with it. So, yep. Enjoy guys offer code, nice or coupon code. Nice. Um, for free shipping on orders,
[3053.40 --> 3064.28]  over $69 and 69 cents in other news, Luke, we are now both wearing headphones from a company
[3064.28 --> 3074.92]  that just sold their headphone division. Yeah. Okay. Wait, what? Right. They sold their entire consumer
[3074.92 --> 3082.28]  audio division, which makes headphones, uh, sound bars and DACs to a Swiss based medical hearing
[3082.28 --> 3088.68]  company called Synova holding AG, which specializes in hearing aids and cochlear implants. Uh, for those
[3088.68 --> 3094.44]  of you who aren't familiar, cochlear implants are a type of implant that replace, um, some of the
[3094.44 --> 3100.44]  functional components of your inner ear. So you can actually, it's a lot more complicated than this,
[3100.44 --> 3105.72]  but basically if you have suffered hearing loss, you can get one of these implants and assuming all the
[3105.72 --> 3111.56]  conditions, all the stars align, you can restore some amount of hearing. Um,
[3113.80 --> 3118.84]  my understanding is at least this is how it used to work that you, if you have residual natural
[3118.84 --> 3123.08]  hearing, you actually kind of have to scoop all that out. So you're left with only the artificial
[3123.08 --> 3129.00]  hearing. So it's like, it's a whole, it's a whole thing. I'm not, I'm not promoting or not promoting it one
[3129.00 --> 3136.36]  way or the other. I'm just saying that's what they are. And Synova holding AG now owns the Sennheiser
[3136.36 --> 3142.36]  headphone business. The thing that's really mind blowing to me is Sennheiser talks about how,
[3142.92 --> 3150.20]  or talked about a while back, how they, you know, don't make money on headphones. And I'm kind of
[3150.20 --> 3158.60]  sitting here going, okay, I get it because we saw their R and D facility. You were, you were there with
[3158.60 --> 3163.56]  me when we did the German tour, right? We, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause we went to cherry as well. Um,
[3163.56 --> 3171.16]  the only way that Sennheiser could not be making money on headphones based on the actual, like materials
[3171.16 --> 3176.92]  cost of a pair of headphones and how much they charge for them. And the kind of volume that Sennheiser moves
[3177.48 --> 3185.88]  is if there's just a lot of, um, like a lot of cost associated with bringing to market products that
[3186.44 --> 3192.92]  don't, don't move the kind of volume like Sennheiser has a very broad product mix. And guys,
[3192.92 --> 3197.00]  like we've been going through a process, launching a product for LTT store, which hasn't launched yet,
[3197.00 --> 3207.00]  but, um, it will where we've had to do actual custom tooling and like injection molding, uh, parts
[3207.00 --> 3214.52]  for the, for the final assembly of this product. And let me tell you, when you buy a pair of headphones
[3214.52 --> 3224.20]  on like Amazon or eBay or something for like $22, it is, it is absolutely mind boggling that,
[3224.20 --> 3230.04]  that, that can be done. The, the kind of volume of that product that you have to move in order to
[3230.04 --> 3236.36]  make up for the upfront costs of setting up the machines to, to injection mold, these plastic parts
[3236.36 --> 3243.56]  and that, that kind of thing is just, it's crazy. Like you can easily spend like six figures on just
[3243.56 --> 3249.48]  even like a small, a small device that has, you know, five or six different components that are
[3249.48 --> 3256.84]  actually well in excess of that easily. So I can see how maybe there would have been management issues
[3256.84 --> 3261.88]  or bloat that might've made it hard for them to make a profit with their headphone division.
[3261.88 --> 3267.96]  But it just seems like the kind of thing that could have been fixed.
[3269.24 --> 3271.56]  I don't know.
[3271.56 --> 3279.16]  Especially cause like when we went on that tour, the amount of pedigree that company has is ridiculous.
[3279.72 --> 3282.28]  And like the, the story is so
[3284.36 --> 3288.92]  deep and crazy just to sell it off seems weird.
[3288.92 --> 3296.28]  Yeah. Apparently they also sold the rights to continue using the Sennheiser brand
[3296.84 --> 3302.92]  on these products, which is really baffling to me because it seems like Sennheiser is holding
[3302.92 --> 3310.04]  onto its professional audio division. So you could potentially have this reputation that Sennheiser
[3310.04 --> 3315.72]  has for building great audio products compromised by a company that.
[3315.72 --> 3316.60]  That's so weird.
[3317.56 --> 3325.08]  Yeah. I'm a, I'm just, honestly, I'm just kind of blown away. Like it just seems like the kind of problem that
[3327.24 --> 3329.24]  was solvable, you know?
[3329.24 --> 3330.44]  And it's always.
[3330.44 --> 3336.52]  What constitutes consumer headphones? Like at what level does that begin and end?
[3336.52 --> 3340.92]  Is it, is this just their entire headphones division and they're, they're pro audio?
[3340.92 --> 3347.08]  Cause like I'm, I'm on their website, but there's, there's, it doesn't actually seem to divide very nicely.
[3347.08 --> 3351.96]  I would imagine basically anything headphones that Sennheiser makes would be considered consumer.
[3351.96 --> 3352.60]  Yeah.
[3352.60 --> 3352.92]  Yeah.
[3352.92 --> 3353.56]  Yeah.
[3353.56 --> 3353.88]  Yeah.
[3353.88 --> 3354.44]  Yeah.
[3354.44 --> 3357.80]  But you're including like HD 800 and above.
[3357.80 --> 3361.96]  Absolutely. That would still be consumer, high end consumer, but it's still, it's still consumer.
[3362.60 --> 3367.48]  And like, I, what it wouldn't include is something like a, like a shotgun microphone,
[3367.48 --> 3369.00]  like professional audio equipment.
[3369.72 --> 3374.28]  So I'm, yeah, I'm just, I'm just blown away. It seems like it should have been fixable.
[3374.28 --> 3381.96]  Like you said, Sennheiser's expertise, Sennheiser's brand story should have made them an unstoppable
[3381.96 --> 3388.28]  behemoth in this space, but they just couldn't get it down. I mean, it's no secret that I love the
[3388.28 --> 3392.84]  products. I mean, I can literally use any headphones in the world I want, but nothing,
[3393.40 --> 3399.72]  nothing just does it for me. Like these do maybe part of the problem is these are HD 600s. These are
[3399.72 --> 3402.36]  a product from like the late eighties.
[3402.92 --> 3406.28]  That's what I was going to say is I think they had a really hard time modernizing.
[3406.28 --> 3408.04]  Sorry. Nineties, 97.
[3408.68 --> 3413.72]  Um, I think it was the, what was it? The, what, what came before the 600s? It doesn't matter.
[3413.72 --> 3421.24]  The point is this is a 25 year old product. Um, and I just, I haven't, they haven't built anything
[3422.20 --> 3427.96]  that to me is so much better that I need to upgrade to it. And so maybe that's,
[3427.96 --> 3430.52]  maybe that's part of the problem. Maybe they just built it too good.
[3431.72 --> 3436.44]  Yeah. And like, I've had these since like basically right out of high school.
[3436.44 --> 3439.96]  Yeah. You've had them the entire time I've known you. And I think all you've done is replaced the,
[3439.96 --> 3446.92]  uh, the pads. Yeah. Quite a few times at this point, like to the point now where I can't,
[3446.92 --> 3450.52]  I have to buy them from like third parties. Cause Sennheiser doesn't sell the earpad
[3450.52 --> 3454.12]  replacements anymore. Sennheiser is never going to sell your earpad replacements anymore. Luke,
[3454.12 --> 3463.16]  you're done, bud. Oh, this is really disappointing. Um, I don't know. It's, it's just, that's,
[3463.16 --> 3468.52]  I mean, that's it. I think they had a hard time modernizing. I know, um, at least when,
[3468.52 --> 3472.12]  when I was back doing reviews and when I think you guys did more audio reviews,
[3472.12 --> 3475.72]  cause I don't think it's a huge thing for you guys anymore, but, um,
[3477.00 --> 3481.96]  a lot of their modernization efforts, they weren't, they were weird.
[3481.96 --> 3489.00]  They were still very traditional. Yeah. Very, very traditional, like kind of, um,
[3489.64 --> 3493.48]  not afraid to pursue trends, but, um,
[3495.72 --> 3500.04]  kind of felt like there was an attitude of being too good to do it. Like it was kind of beneath them.
[3500.04 --> 3505.16]  Like, no, we take this stuff actually seriously. Like, what do you mean? Shiny plastic beats you.
[3506.04 --> 3511.88]  Um, and to be clear, it's not like I disagreed with them, but at the end of the day, you know,
[3511.88 --> 3518.04]  I mean, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago. Why do I put up with Amazon's crappy, um,
[3518.60 --> 3522.92]  policies? Why do, why do we sell our products on Amazon? Because at the end of the day,
[3522.92 --> 3526.92]  you know, you got mouths to feed. So you're either going to lay off, what would they lay off? Like
[3526.92 --> 3530.44]  600 people or something from their headphone division. So you're either going to lay off a
[3530.44 --> 3537.96]  bunch of people or you're going to just do what you got to do. It's not like we're talking about a
[3537.96 --> 3544.20]  morally reprehensible thing you're doing. It's just, you know, trying to crawl out of your own
[3544.20 --> 3550.84]  butt and address the current market condition. Right. But if they just like, don't want to,
[3550.84 --> 3555.96]  then I guess like that's chill. Right. The thing that's really sad about this is we are,
[3557.24 --> 3562.92]  we are losing another company where like, you just talked about, like, that's a 25 year old product.
[3562.92 --> 3567.16]  And I just mentioned that these headphones are, are ancient to me. Like you can see on Wancho,
[3567.16 --> 3571.40]  you can see spots where like they've been dinged up and stuff. Gamer rage.
[3571.40 --> 3578.92]  Gamer rage. Yeah. Still fine. I've, I've sat on these. Um, other people have sat on these.
[3578.92 --> 3583.72]  I remember getting really, really pissed off at one of my friends who went over to my house and
[3584.52 --> 3588.28]  they were playing games on my computer. And when they left, they put my headphones on their chair.
[3588.28 --> 3595.08]  And then when they came back, they sat on them. They were these, they're still fine. I've walked away
[3595.08 --> 3598.20]  from the computer and they've like hooked on my chair and they've whipped across the room. They're
[3598.20 --> 3603.56]  still fine. They've moved tons of times. I brought them with me on trips. They're still fine. Like
[3603.56 --> 3611.80]  they've survived everything. And that's not very common anymore with products. It's just not like
[3611.80 --> 3616.36]  planned obsolescence. It's absolutely a thing. And Sennheiser didn't do it. And now they're gone.
[3616.36 --> 3620.36]  And that should make people sad. Like genuinely that should make people sad.
[3621.56 --> 3628.76]  Ah, that's, that is disappointing. I think that was pretty much it. I mean,
[3628.76 --> 3635.88]  I'm driving a Porsche now. We could talk about that. It's still, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. A Porsche.
[3639.40 --> 3643.56]  I just tried to figure out a way that I could do that text-based meme audibly,
[3643.56 --> 3648.52]  and it just doesn't work. Have you seen that though? Which one? You pronounce Porsche,
[3649.08 --> 3654.20]  Porsche, not Porsche, but they just, they, it's all, it's typed out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[3654.20 --> 3662.44]  Yeah. I get it. I get it. Um, it's fine. I definitely feel that boomer energy when I'm behind the wheel.
[3662.44 --> 3668.68]  It's the closest thing to like an emotional experience that I've ever had driving a car. Um,
[3668.68 --> 3675.40]  I'm just like, I feel like, I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out like how to do this video
[3675.40 --> 3680.60]  because there's a lot of stuff that's really cool. It's chock full of amazing, super cool technology.
[3680.60 --> 3689.24]  I mean, obviously, even to me, a stupid, you know, car pleb, it is noticeably a better driving
[3689.24 --> 3695.56]  experience than anything I've ever touched. Like, yeah, for sure. Yep. It's real. It's not, it's not fake.
[3695.56 --> 3704.92]  Um, but I, I feel like such an imposter behind the wheel. Like, I just like, I don't, I know that I'm
[3704.92 --> 3713.64]  not fully appreciating this thing. And, um, I, yeah, I know that I'm not cool enough to be driving it,
[3713.64 --> 3721.32]  but here I am. Don't look through the windows. It's, it's pretty fun so far. It's pretty fun so
[3721.32 --> 3729.88]  far. Uh, all right. I think that's pretty much it for the show today. Thank you very much, ladies and
[3729.88 --> 3738.36]  Oh, uh, just to clarify, I did not buy a Taycan. I am renting it for a month. So that's my compromise
[3738.36 --> 3745.72]  with my wife that allows me to do car videos, but not actually have to spend car money in order to
[3745.72 --> 3752.36]  do car videos because a lot of manufacturers, um, their press cars, they'll only lend them out for
[3752.36 --> 3757.64]  a few days or a week tops. And that's just not enough time for us to evaluate something like that
[3757.64 --> 3763.72]  and make a video about it to the level that we want to do it. So we're just outright refusing to do so.
[3763.72 --> 3769.88]  And, um, uh, fortunately I think the way this one worked is it's actually a rental program
[3770.68 --> 3775.72]  from either Porsche directly or from one of their dealerships. I don't remember exactly how it worked.
[3776.44 --> 3782.44]  Uh, unfortunately YouTube glitched out and I only have a handful of super chats today
[3782.44 --> 3790.60]  from the latter part of the show. I'm like sincerely sorry, you guys. Um, but this is all I've got.
[3790.60 --> 3797.24]  Uh, Alex says, uh, monopolies are bad. Why hate Epic as competition? We don't hate them
[3797.24 --> 3801.56]  as competition. I mean, they've done some really dumb stuff that, and they've gotten some well-deserved
[3801.56 --> 3807.08]  hate for it, but, uh, we just think that that was a very optimistic, uh, outlook.
[3809.48 --> 3816.04]  Oh, okay. I don't know what that means. Uh, we need to figure out a way for some people like me can
[3816.04 --> 3819.88]  challenge Linus on Super Mario Brothers 3 battle mode, even though we're not on the same continent.
[3819.88 --> 3825.08]  Man, Super Mario Brothers 3 battle mode is already squishy enough in terms of inputs that
[3825.72 --> 3833.24]  it's a little random who's going to win. Uh, playing that game across continents with that kind of leg,
[3833.24 --> 3835.00]  I think would be, uh, worse.
[3835.00 --> 3839.32]  I had so, I know I mentioned at the beginning of this as well, but I had so much fun watching that
[3839.32 --> 3845.56]  video. Oh, everyone that went up to you and challenged you at two of the games, you should
[3845.56 --> 3848.84]  watch it. But everyone that challenged you at two of the games, I'm just like, you're going to get
[3848.84 --> 3853.56]  tooled. And then every time someone picked that third one, I was like, finally, they actually like
[3853.56 --> 3856.68]  have paid attention and didn't know what to do.
[3856.68 --> 3861.32]  I don't know if this made it into the video. I don't remember, but I was just chatting with one of
[3861.32 --> 3865.88]  the guys and I was like, Hey, what made you pick mortal combat? And he's like, honestly,
[3865.88 --> 3870.92]  I've just never ever seen you play a fighting game. Yeah. I've been watching for years. I've
[3870.92 --> 3875.56]  never seen you touch a fighting game. So I figured you probably have no idea what you're doing. And I
[3875.56 --> 3883.72]  was like, got him. I love the guy that really wanted to challenge me at beat saber and was sure
[3883.72 --> 3889.80]  that he was going to slay me at beats. He's clearly never watched any of my beat saber streams. You know
[3889.80 --> 3896.28]  what though? I have a really fun one coming up soon. I don't think it's going to be a video. I don't
[3896.28 --> 3900.04]  know. Maybe we'll do a float plane exclusive or something. But you know how I've said that David
[3900.76 --> 3906.12]  thinks that after one week of training, he can beat me at beat saber. What's now officially have
[3906.12 --> 3915.08]  money on the line. So it's 10 to one. So I have to put up $100 to his $10. And the challenge date,
[3915.08 --> 3923.64]  I think is it penciled in for the week of the 17th. So that's the week that he has to train up. And
[3923.64 --> 3928.44]  then probably that weekend, I'm going to stream this for sure. He's going to take me on in beat
[3928.44 --> 3934.76]  saber one V one me rust. And we'll see if we'll see if he can catch up in that. Wow. All right.
[3935.56 --> 3940.60]  Uh, Luna says about to make you guys go bankrupt ordering 100 water bottles to Brazil. Um,
[3940.60 --> 3946.68]  thank you for that. Uh, cable feed says body ABCs of gaming. I'm a new uncle and a 40 ounce water
[3946.68 --> 3950.68]  bottle nine days ago. Do you know when I will get the shipment? Okay. So a couple of things. Number
[3950.68 --> 3954.92]  one, we had a huge order rush. So that did slow things down a little bit. I think we're pretty much
[3954.92 --> 3961.24]  recovered from that. But number two, worldwide shipping is basically a cluster right now. So
[3961.24 --> 3969.00]  you'll get it when you get it. Uh, Josh JLMG production says line of sad face mouse pad. When
[3969.96 --> 3973.88]  I mean, it'll be weeks because of the worldwide shipping situation. We've had,
[3973.96 --> 3978.20]  we've had containers that are like supposed to be picked up one month, get picked up like two months
[3978.20 --> 3981.88]  later and then get delayed at the port and then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I don't want to
[3981.88 --> 3987.96]  promise anything, but we are going to do them. And I think that's pretty much it for this week.
[3987.96 --> 3993.88]  Sup CHP. Hope you, uh, hope you have a better week next week. We will see you again next week.
[3993.88 --> 3999.64]  Same bad time, same bad channel. Okay. John Carlos Morla Janau says, Hey, what do you think about the
[3999.64 --> 4005.08]  MKBHD video? You launched the video right as we went live. How much, but you guys are sitting here
[4005.08 --> 4009.56]  with me the whole time. I haven't watched it yet. Uh, but I will. Uh, Mark has made a right to repair
[4009.56 --> 4015.88]  video. So yeah, it's good. Good. That the whole movement is getting more attention guys. Never forget
[4015.88 --> 4023.48]  right to repair. Shiv P says thoughts on anti-right to repair. My thoughts on anti-right to repair are
[4023.48 --> 4028.92]  either they're ignorant or they have some kind of agenda and we need to figure out what it is
[4028.92 --> 4037.72]  because there is no, there's, there's no, you know, red blooded freedom, loving alignment
[4037.72 --> 4046.04]  that can possibly be anti-right to repair. It just isn't compatible. It's that simple. We made a video
[4046.04 --> 4051.96]  about it a couple of weeks ago that I pretty much said everything that I have to say. Um, it's one of
[4051.96 --> 4056.52]  those videos where my writer brought me the script and technically there's a writing credit, but I ended
[4056.52 --> 4062.00]  up almost completely rewriting it during script review. So that's, that's what I had to say about it.
[4062.00 --> 4067.44]  I don't really have anything else to add. All right. See y'all later guys. Bye.
[4071.12 --> 4081.44]  Oh man.
[4081.44 --> 4093.20]  This Sennheiser thing is actually like so sad. I don't ever want to use any other headphones.
[4093.68 --> 4095.28]  Why did you have to go away?
