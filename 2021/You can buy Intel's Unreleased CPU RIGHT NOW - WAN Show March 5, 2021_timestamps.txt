Responding to timestamp 1:08:10 Also the reason that the Democrats voted against it is first they "say they want small business to succeed but that is not true. For example, I know that there were some PPP funds for a state and instead of them going out to all the SMALL businesses they went to black businesses and LGBTQ people first, and then there was not enough for other people. It was a racist move and was not supportive of business. Also if democrats wanted better small businesses they would not raise taxes EVERY single damn time they are in office. Plus democrats love cities and the big companies in cities and they do not like the country so most of the time they are only trying to support the big cities with big companies (or not by imposing huge taxes that also apply to business and regulations and red tape). :(

Replying to timestamp 1:07:16 Exactly if the government wanted to be more efficient they could hire companies to do a lot of work for them! And the companies will often do a better and less expensive job because the company MUST make money forcing the companies to do way better than if the government did not hire them!
