[0.00 --> 9.00]  welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today of
[9.00 --> 16.90]  course the big news this week was Apple making the very un-Apple move of creating a self-service
[16.90 --> 23.48]  repair program in the most Apple possible way because there was a gun to their head and their
[23.48 --> 29.10]  arm twisted behind their back gotta freaking love it in other big controversial news
[29.10 --> 38.74]  Streamlabs which is now Streamlabs not Streamlabs OBS has been involved in a public TIFF with the
[38.74 --> 44.96]  makers of OBS or open broadcast and others open open broadcaster software that's what it's short
[44.96 --> 49.52]  for right I think it's just broad system or is it system software I think what's the s for
[49.52 --> 55.50]  oh wow this is embarrassing yeah oh broadcaster yeah you're right open broadcaster software there
[55.50 --> 63.18]  we go all right what else we got this week NFT Bay uh a a pirate bay for NFTs wait are you serious
[63.18 --> 68.74]  it's a pirated NFT okay we'll talk about that wait you didn't know no I hadn't thought you don't know
[68.74 --> 73.98]  about right click save as oh my goodness I mean I know what right click save as is anyway okay anyways
[73.98 --> 78.14]  the next thing NFT Bay there's like 20 terabytes of it it's it's interesting we'll talk about that later
[78.14 --> 84.80]  also I'm gonna jump to this just because this this I'm actually very happy this is happening which
[84.80 --> 91.12]  might make me sound horrible but uh the fall of Activision slash Blizzard Bobby Kotick is the worst
[91.12 --> 96.80]  of the bunch I tried to go out on a bit of a limb a while ago and call it Bobby Kotick on Wancho because
[96.80 --> 104.10]  like I felt like no one else was and now it's happening and I feel I feel validated it's good it's
[104.10 --> 109.70]  good he's finally he's finally taken the sword um yeah he's like a horrible person but we'll talk
[109.70 --> 110.14]  about that later
[110.14 --> 133.28]  and the show is brought to you by Xter Squarespace
[133.28 --> 135.94]  and Secret Lab
[135.94 --> 140.72]  all right there's a couple of merch messages that are amazing I just need to get to these really quick
[140.72 --> 148.32]  uh oh wait where oh where'd it go um uh okay this is great how do I open the bicep pocket on the
[148.32 --> 151.58]  WAN hoodie while wearing it can you demo all right ready
[151.58 --> 154.88]  there you go
[154.88 --> 160.66]  that's honestly how I've done it there's actually a lot of feedback about how a lot of the pockets on
[160.66 --> 163.32]  the WAN hoodie v2 are kind of pointless
[163.32 --> 170.78]  that's fair we know actually but if you find a point for it and someone sees you actually use it
[170.78 --> 176.84]  it's super sick so every time it's just one of those things where we did it because the original
[176.84 --> 182.12]  one had a lot of pointless pockets too and we were like apparently people like that so here we go boys
[182.12 --> 190.12]  um do it again all right let's go ahead and jump into our first topic today of course it's Apple's
[190.12 --> 195.74]  self-service repair program or as we're calling it ASER program
[195.74 --> 204.50]  they announced it on Wednesday and this is a really big deal because Apple has famously made like not
[204.50 --> 212.10]  just not just passively not by accident Apple has famously intentionally made their devices more
[212.10 --> 220.08]  difficult to repair in recent years for end users for non-authorized repair shops I mean they even
[220.08 --> 226.38]  refused to repair our Mac Pro which there is a lot of confusion over what happened with that saga
[226.38 --> 234.16]  the number of people that have read incorrect reports of what happened and assumed that we were
[234.16 --> 241.86]  somehow looking for some kind of handout is mind-blowing they wanted to pay for it we we broke it and we
[241.86 --> 252.42]  said hey mea culpa we want you to fix it we will pay you they refused they would not do it that is
[252.42 --> 258.68]  unacceptable for any company that's ridiculous you don't want like e-waste garbage in the world like
[258.68 --> 264.14]  that that's the like they wanted to pay for it we were ready to pay for it so
[264.14 --> 270.74]  um at that time Apple required a service ticket in order to order a part penalizing or even
[270.74 --> 276.28]  blacklisting Apple authorized service providers who don't send the broken parts back to them
[276.28 --> 283.40]  so what happened was not only would Apple not repair it for us we couldn't get anyone else to do it for
[283.40 --> 290.36]  us because and this was rectified later they did eventually approve a replacement but the cost was
[290.36 --> 298.62]  ridiculous because to Apple a motherboard is apparently the motherboard CPU RAM which is stupid
[298.62 --> 303.86]  obviously yeah anyway we did eventually get that sorted out we ended up doing it ourselves anyway
[303.86 --> 308.68]  because it wasn't cost effective but they required a service ticket because once our uh once our serial
[308.68 --> 312.94]  number was flagged in the system nobody could order a board for us because they would have to send
[312.94 --> 318.76]  back our serial number like they'd have to send back the board and then Apple be like uh uh no
[318.76 --> 325.60]  like like the amount of control that they exercise over this stuff is just unbelievable so what this does
[325.60 --> 331.56]  is it keeps these broken parts off the gray market for independent repair and allows Apple's own repair
[331.56 --> 336.92]  service to enjoy an advantage in repair in part access over even their Apple authorized service providers
[336.92 --> 343.52]  so the TLDR Apple has fought independent repair at every turn for at least a decade but this self-service
[343.52 --> 350.22]  repair program or ASER is uh going to support the iPhone 12 and 13 to begin with and will offer
[350.22 --> 357.86]  apparently more than 200 individual parts and tools including display assemblies camera modules batteries
[357.86 --> 364.06]  and then of course the tools that are required to make the repairs it will be only available in the United
[364.06 --> 371.50]  States to start in early 2022 but will expand to additional countries throughout 2022 uh support
[371.50 --> 382.64]  for additional repairs and M1 Max will come later in 2022 so your thoughts uh honestly when I read this
[382.64 --> 391.42]  and I still kind of feel this way yeah I'm just waiting till I see it yeah I think that's fair enough
[391.42 --> 398.66]  I think there's a hundred ways that Apple can make this not make any sense even just pricing yeah if
[398.66 --> 404.90]  the pricing doesn't make any sense because Apple forces you to buy let's say let's say not only the
[404.90 --> 411.62]  screen but also all of the tools required even if you already own them there's also like right now we're
[411.62 --> 417.46]  in a chip shortage right so are they are they going to prioritize this right so availability will they
[417.46 --> 422.38]  even have stock is it just going to be permanently out of stock and overpriced like I don't know maybe it
[422.38 --> 426.64]  won't be I'd love to give them benefit of the doubt I think that's kind of where I'm sitting right now I
[426.64 --> 430.98]  think this is very cool I'm happy they're stepping in this direction at all because even if it's ineffective
[430.98 --> 437.94]  maybe it gets some more people to start embracing this type of stuff but is Apple moving in this direction or are
[437.94 --> 443.70]  they just trying to appease they've been pushed in this direction well either way honestly I don't care as long as
[443.70 --> 449.94]  there's more right to repair stuff going on it's been pointed out that Wednesday happened to be this is probably a
[449.94 --> 456.94]  coincidence though happens to be the deadline for Apple to take action on a pro repair shareholder resolution filed by
[456.94 --> 463.94]  environmental activists oh Apple could have faced SEC enforcement had they not complied
[463.94 --> 470.94]  okay yeah like I I'm sure they didn't want to do this that that's the kind of vibe I've been getting this whole time
[470.94 --> 481.94]  um the irony or not irony the the hypocrisy of all of this is that Apple beats this drum and I've been I've been criticized uh very
[481.94 --> 489.94]  uh very recently I was criticized for not pointing out HP's uh excellent access to service manuals and parts which I
[489.94 --> 495.94]  actually did do in a recent video but that was not the only thing that particular critic got wrong about um things that I
[495.94 --> 503.94]  have or haven't said um I was I was criticized for not pointing out HP's uh excellent moves and I've also been criticized
[503.94 --> 511.94]  for not pointing out that there are plenty of other companies that don't do any better of a job than Apple they might not go as
[511.94 --> 518.94]  far uh to prevent users from repairing their devices but certainly don't go out of their way to help with it
[518.94 --> 523.94]  yeah and the reason for that is that it's Apple's hypocrisy that makes them such a target for me
[523.94 --> 533.94]  they keep talking about green carbon neutral environment blah blah blah they have an entire they have an entire website
[533.94 --> 540.94]  like like sub site dedicated to how environmentally friendly they are and they use it as a selling point for moving
[540.94 --> 548.94]  for moves that are frankly blatantly obviously just about saving cost like not including chargers with their phones
[548.94 --> 557.94]  um there happens to be an environmental benefit which is great out a w is a w for sure yes but don't pretend
[557.94 --> 564.94]  that that's why you did it because whenever it is inconvenient whenever it is not profitable even in some cases when it would be
[564.94 --> 572.94]  profitable for them to just make these parts accessible Apple actively fights against people repairing their own devices
[572.94 --> 580.94]  and especially small shops repairing Apple devices without Apple's blessing and that is environmentally devastating
[580.94 --> 588.94]  throwing away shredding working devices even in some cases working devices that still are getting software updates like we're not even talking
[588.94 --> 596.94]  stuff that would be a security risk to be on any network or anything like that we're talking working actively supporting devices
[596.94 --> 606.94]  supporting devices shredding those there is absolutely no way to spin that into some kind of environmental positive and the Apple apologists will say
[606.94 --> 614.94]  well um actually Linus Apple recycles a lot of stuff good good for them that's good I'm not going to criticize them for that
[614.94 --> 624.94]  what I'm criticizing them for is resorting to the worst R when the first two R's were absolutely accessible in many cases
[624.94 --> 632.94]  that's why I'm critical reduce reuse reduce reuse but repair should probably be in there too reduce recycle
[632.94 --> 642.94]  isn't repair and reduce kind of yeah sure I'm repairing is a means to reduction yes so that is that is the first R the best R
[642.94 --> 654.94]  um so like so yeah I don't know I I I will see in the future I suspect it's kind of a not entirely fully real move but we'll see
[654.94 --> 661.94]  yeah I mean Apple still has an opportunity here to completely blow us away and yes and I would love that that would be great
[661.94 --> 669.94]  make a very open to it even if it wasn't the full you know transparency that we might want that that someone
[669.94 --> 677.94]  like a Rossman might want right where Apple's providing literal schematics and part number ordering part
[677.94 --> 685.94]  numbers for every capacitor on the board right like even if they don't go that far I'd say the vast majority
[685.94 --> 691.94]  of dead iPhones that you just want a quick and easy repair at your local shop in the mall or whatever
[691.94 --> 697.94]  are going to be your broken screens your broken lightning connectors right though those like a button that
[697.94 --> 703.94]  doesn't work as long as that basic stuff is covered battery replacements these are batteries are consumables
[703.94 --> 709.94]  even rechargeable batteries they're consumables yeah um as long as you've got all those major bases covered
[709.94 --> 717.94]  I I would consider this a win for consumers uh obviously Apple could take it a step farther and they could just
[717.94 --> 723.94]  you know uh no I don't think I would even ask for that so I'm not gonna bring it up I'm not gonna bring it up I
[723.94 --> 731.94]  wanna make sure that I'm being reasonable okay uh now speaking of Rossman uh Lewis Rossman did respond uh with
[731.94 --> 739.94]  mild skepticism especially after Apple's independent repair provider program in 2019 yeah um required
[739.94 --> 745.94]  independent repair shops to agree to replace entire assemblies even if the faulty component itself should
[745.94 --> 751.94]  cost significantly less he's been on this ride before as little as sixty dollars versus three hundred dollars so a
[751.94 --> 757.94]  keyboard issue for example gee were keyboard issues a problem for Apple in 2019 was that a common thing just a
[757.94 --> 762.74]  little bit I think I I don't think anyone almost all of them I think I don't think anyone needed their
[762.74 --> 767.70]  keyboard replaced on a MacBook in 2019 nah that doesn't ring a bell nah so a keyboard issue would
[767.70 --> 772.10]  actually require the replacement of the entire upper chassis including the trackpad battery speakers
[772.10 --> 778.50]  microphones and of course the the shell itself I mean that's ridiculous but in order to become one of
[778.50 --> 784.10]  these uh repair providers you had to agree to perform the repairs like that and if you're found in
[784.10 --> 790.50]  violation uh there can be penalties so that's not that's not really providing options that's just
[790.50 --> 796.74]  making the independent repair shop uncompetitive right like forcing them to charge three hundred dollars for
[796.74 --> 802.58]  a sixty dollar repair is not reasonable um so Lewis called on Apple to sell individual parts and not make
[802.58 --> 809.06]  this a meme like the independent repair program and uh if Apple takes it seriously has said he will
[809.06 --> 813.86]  swallow everything he said about them and move forward working together no grudges nice
[813.86 --> 820.10]  I believe that I believe that um I think that I think that Lewis absolutely can get very angry
[820.10 --> 826.50]  about things but I also think that he's a reasonable person who can get unangry as quickly as he gets
[826.50 --> 831.46]  angry as long as you're doing it the way that he thinks it should be done which by and large he tends
[831.46 --> 835.86]  to be right about I would also say that in a lot of cases when he is really angry about something
[835.86 --> 842.26]  we need someone like him to be angry about it and it's very helpful to have him being angry about it
[842.26 --> 848.26]  maybe not fantastic for like mental health reasons stuff being constantly angry um but like we need
[848.26 --> 853.78]  someone fighting to fight he will live a shorter life on account of that uh and I hate that because
[853.78 --> 860.50]  you know love the guy um but but yeah like it's it's very good to have someone fighting that fight
[860.50 --> 868.50]  so someone asked um if there could be digital gift cards on the LTT store there are um maybe you
[868.50 --> 872.50]  need to work on the searchability on LTT store a little bit well there's physical gift cards but
[872.50 --> 879.86]  are they digital ones oh we mail people those gift cards oh I actually don't know do we I just assumed
[879.86 --> 886.66]  they would be digital because it's like no I think they're physical wow Sarah did up late graphics for the cards
[886.66 --> 898.18]  wow yeah okay um maybe we'll make digital ones I'll talk to Nick um oh I love it all right um so the
[898.18 --> 901.78]  question the reason why they asked that which is actually kind of interesting is they're saying for
[901.78 --> 907.30]  for like Christmas presents yeah Conrad said they're digital he said they're digital okay I don't know I
[907.30 --> 912.18]  don't know yes they're digital um so the the reason why they asked that was because they can gift people
[912.18 --> 918.18]  in uh they're all digital overseas countries okay gift cards for Christmas and stuff because a lot of
[918.18 --> 922.82]  these people like bundling their purchases because of shipment costs sure they are digital sorry cool
[922.82 --> 928.26]  I was I was completely mistaken so Sarah just the graphics are great yeah they're they're actually
[928.26 --> 932.66]  super cool and I like that there's individual ones for the the different values of gift card that you can
[932.66 --> 940.58]  buy and stuff but uh Tom Arnold made the intro where I come out of a box all right let's move on to our
[940.58 --> 945.70]  next topic I mean I guess that's all there is to really say oh actually no there is a discussion
[945.70 --> 951.54]  topic here that Anthony put in for us would repairability make you more likely to purchase
[951.54 --> 959.70]  Apple products in the future there's you personally I mean you've even considered going iPhone in the
[959.70 --> 967.30]  last in the last calendar yeah I had to pause talk about it yeah um it I I don't I don't know if it
[967.30 --> 971.38]  would make me buy them but the question was technically more likely would it make you more
[971.38 --> 977.14]  likely would make me more likely to buy it I still don't know if that would result in me buying it
[977.86 --> 983.38]  but it I mean it it makes the the situation a lot better like I I'm I'm trying to value
[983.38 --> 988.82]  repairability quite highly in in future purchases right now and there's a few phones on the market
[988.82 --> 993.78]  that look like they have considerable repairability but the main one that I'm interested in is overseas
[993.78 --> 998.74]  only Europe only I believe right um so that's a little unfortunate blah blah blah uh but like
[998.74 --> 1003.30]  that's kind of that is a big solid point for me specifically right now so yeah it would make me
[1003.30 --> 1009.38]  more likely Apple already does a great job on sustainability from a software perspective they
[1009.38 --> 1015.62]  support their hardware longer than almost it than anyone else there's very old iPhone in the mobile
[1015.62 --> 1021.46]  phone space taking it yeah the iPhone se is still getting software updates yeah so all they have to do is
[1021.46 --> 1027.62]  do the hardware too and then yeah that would make me more likely but it would also have to be part of
[1027.62 --> 1036.02]  an overall attitude shift towards um not assuming how I want to do things right um yeah I can quickly
[1036.02 --> 1043.54]  find phone apps by the way because I have like a template for my folders and I just use muscle memory
[1043.54 --> 1047.38]  I know exactly where everything is and I've been using exactly the same layout for many years
[1047.38 --> 1053.62]  um apparently one of uh one of our viewers their favorite WAN show is the one from Japan
[1054.26 --> 1062.18]  man it has been a long time that was a heck of a show that was something else oh man yeah that was
[1062.18 --> 1067.78]  amazing I the uh the camera setup for that will be something that I will never forget in my whole life
[1067.78 --> 1074.58]  I am going oh just the fact that Edsel passed out drunk and we all forgot we were supposed to do WAN yeah
[1074.58 --> 1082.58]  so like I yeah so he was like not able to really not function stay upright but he got the camera going
[1082.58 --> 1087.78]  yeah and like sort of monitored it and everything it was like it was actually pretty impressive
[1087.78 --> 1094.10]  considering the degree of inebriation yeah um yeah so that's pretty cool
[1095.94 --> 1103.38]  I can keep watching the forum I'm finally traveling again I am going on my first trip in I mean technically I
[1103.38 --> 1110.58]  guess I went down to Seattle to to visit valve to check out the early steam deck uh man they keep
[1110.58 --> 1115.46]  kind of emailing me I was like keep me in the loop keep me in the loop and they're doing that and every
[1115.46 --> 1120.74]  time I see an email from my valve rep I'm like is this the one is this the one where I'm getting my
[1120.74 --> 1126.74]  unit and I can start to make videos about it because I have so many questions to answer still I'm so excited
[1126.74 --> 1132.10]  uh did you see in their developer event that they um they formalized because I think this was either
[1132.10 --> 1136.98]  rumored or expected at some point but they formalized that steam os 3.0 is going to be a
[1136.98 --> 1143.54]  standalone Linux distro oh so you can just wow yeah okay okay I've actually been wondering about that
[1143.54 --> 1148.98]  that's pretty interesting all the benefits genuinely pretty interesting the literal millions of dollars
[1148.98 --> 1155.30]  that valve will have put into game compatibility in Linux like is that episode six I think we jumped the
[1155.30 --> 1161.06]  gun I think we jumped the gun on the Linux gaming challenge because steam os 3.0 could potentially
[1161.94 --> 1168.18]  just well I still think it was valuable for us to see where we started before yes yeah but once it
[1168.18 --> 1173.30]  happens I mean there's the potential that we could kind of go okay let's Linux challenge again I'd try it
[1173.30 --> 1180.74]  again I would I'll try it again in a bit my kids were pretty stoked well now that don't necessarily know
[1180.74 --> 1190.50]  if we need to like cold turkey it again I for me because I'm so convenience oriented like I talked
[1190.50 --> 1195.86]  about this in some of the other parts I have more free time and other in other parts like when I have
[1195.86 --> 1203.06]  45 minutes to sit in game I need less than two minutes of it to be launching the game we haven't
[1203.06 --> 1209.38]  yeah we haven't played Anno or Forge Alliance for like a month and a half I actually kind of cheated on you
[1209.38 --> 1217.94]  um the night that you messaged me about playing subcom I didn't get your message because I was like
[1218.66 --> 1225.30]  vibing playing Anno for like three hours oh that's actually pretty chill yeah I was uh I was definitely
[1225.30 --> 1233.94]  I was definitely just I couldn't sleep and I was I I was like oh thank goodness I have because honestly
[1233.94 --> 1240.18]  that's one of the things that I'll do is when I'm tired but not sleepy I'll sit and I'll play a game
[1240.18 --> 1246.26]  that um Anno's not not what I have been going for because Anno was a bit of a problem for me for a
[1246.26 --> 1251.62]  bit where I'd sit down to play for an hour and I was just time's just gone six hours later the game
[1251.62 --> 1257.14]  even tells you every two hours it'll be like hey you should probably get up and stretch your legs or get
[1257.14 --> 1263.62]  a cup of coffee in a while yeah um so it wasn't Anno for a bit um so not having cave story because
[1263.62 --> 1267.62]  that's what I was actually playing late at night yeah I'm not having my save game when I started the
[1267.62 --> 1273.14]  Linux challenge is really really frustrating for me but uh that's something that I'll do when I'm tired
[1273.14 --> 1279.22]  but not sleepy so I was I couldn't sleep so I was just like okay I'm just gonna let myself get tired so
[1279.22 --> 1283.38]  I like fixed a couple of supply chain issues and then I was able to go to bed and I was able to sleep
[1283.38 --> 1290.42]  um I forget where I was going with this story but yes I cheated on you I'm sorry that's all right
[1290.42 --> 1295.62]  it's it's good to be back on Windows for a bit I would like to just I'd like to just stay on Windows
[1295.62 --> 1301.30]  for a little bit like almost exclusively been playing games that don't work on Linux yeah just
[1301.30 --> 1308.34]  to like okay I'm back um what was I gonna say but yeah I in some capacity I would genuinely really like
[1308.34 --> 1312.50]  to try it yeah and like even if we weren't doing an official challenge I would probably
[1313.38 --> 1319.14]  format format that drive and give it a shot um it's very interesting I'm stoked so man once it
[1319.14 --> 1324.74]  comes there's there's so many questions for me to answer I'm really excited um speaking of people who
[1324.74 --> 1328.98]  are excited Nick's been standing here going like this like wanting to wanting to talk to y'all they
[1328.98 --> 1332.98]  won't be able to hear you on these mics because they're super all right all right all right all right
[1332.98 --> 1340.50]  I know about the physical gift cards we dealt with it geez geez everyone's riding me here well I
[1340.50 --> 1348.02]  don't know physical gift cards there Conrad knew and told us like right away yeah okay all right
[1348.02 --> 1354.82]  it's it's the filters is what I'm talking about yeah thanks Nick um I would recommend uh machine
[1354.82 --> 1361.54]  washing cold and then uh laying it out to dry for the desk pad desk pad cleaning there you go all right
[1361.54 --> 1369.62]  why don't we move on to our next topic here the stream labs controversy yeah so I have to confess that
[1369.62 --> 1379.70]  even as someone who sort of pays attention to the streaming and technology space I assumed which
[1379.70 --> 1387.94]  I see now I shouldn't have I assumed that stream labs obs as it used to be called was somehow associated
[1387.94 --> 1396.18]  with obs I knew that stream labs obs is like junk and you shouldn't use it so I'd never really um
[1396.18 --> 1401.54]  um I'd never really gotten into or not junk what I what I had heard about it was that it's more basic
[1402.10 --> 1408.90]  like it's supposed to be streamlined as opposed to fully featured so for my part I was like well I
[1408.90 --> 1413.86]  think I can figure out how to use obs so I'm not going to use the stream labs obs but I could see how
[1413.86 --> 1418.66]  there's a value to something like this existing but I thought that they were just kind of like
[1418.66 --> 1428.90]  different streams of somehow associated projects but that's that's not what it was no so what what
[1428.90 --> 1436.10]  is the deal here uh I they're they're essentially just trying to own the entire software space for
[1436.10 --> 1440.50]  for streaming um as far as my understanding goes they've been trying to do this for a long time
[1440.50 --> 1448.42]  uh I have been frustrated with stream labs for a considerable amount of time because they I don't
[1448.42 --> 1453.94]  remember because it's been genuinely a very long time yeah but there was a service that I used to use
[1454.34 --> 1458.66]  that disappeared and I don't know if they disappeared because they're like ah not enough people are using
[1458.66 --> 1464.26]  us now because of stream labs or if it's because they got like bought out or copied or or what happened
[1464.26 --> 1468.90]  but I know they disappeared and I was frustrated because I didn't like the way that stream labs worked
[1468.90 --> 1473.62]  right and I wanted to be able to use my old thing still and there was some issue with that but it's
[1473.62 --> 1477.22]  it's genuinely been like six years or something so I don't remember the details and I don't want to
[1477.22 --> 1483.46]  claim anything because it could be wrong um but yeah and then there's then there's stream labs obs which I
[1483.46 --> 1490.02]  have exclusively called slobs because I don't like stream labs and I find slobs to be really funny um
[1490.02 --> 1495.94]  okay fair enough uh and then now this is coming out and yeah it's it's annoying and a lot of their
[1495.94 --> 1501.94]  business practices for a long time have been very frustrating um it's it's not just obs it's it's a
[1501.94 --> 1506.50]  slew of other companies lightstream had a really really interesting comparison that they showed
[1506.50 --> 1513.06]  where one of light streams like front page where they show off um their features and stuff is is
[1513.06 --> 1516.18]  practically you probably have to click on the image for people to be able to see it but it's
[1516.18 --> 1523.94]  practically identical to the page that stream labs put up including the reviews right which is just like
[1523.94 --> 1530.10]  what stream lab said that apparently that was uh a test page for internal use that was not meant to
[1530.10 --> 1538.02]  be published which is still like dude you shouldn't just copy paste things including reviews for
[1538.90 --> 1544.58]  like an internal test site just make your own thing just use lorem ipsum like everybody else yeah
[1544.58 --> 1550.90]  like come on layers on your overlays automatically whenever you go live layers on your overlay wow it's
[1550.90 --> 1556.58]  like word for word there's a few things you can find like there's a few ways that they say something
[1556.58 --> 1561.30]  that is exactly different every time throughout the whole web page and stuff like but it's it's quite
[1561.30 --> 1570.10]  egregious it's it's gross i don't know bad not cool business practices um copying stealing
[1570.10 --> 1574.58]  overriding stuff like that so with stream labs obs one of the problems that i i don't think ended up
[1574.58 --> 1580.82]  showing up in here yeah is by having obs in their name and then buying advertising space for the
[1581.78 --> 1588.34]  keyword of obs right searching in google uh when people would search for obs let's see if it happens
[1588.34 --> 1594.34]  now after the controversy no it doesn't uh but for a long time or in the past or whatever you want to
[1594.34 --> 1600.18]  say it um if you search obs it would come up with streamlabs obs right um which is kind of blah
[1601.86 --> 1605.94]  so i mean apparently i'm not the only one that was confused and thought there was some kind of
[1606.50 --> 1612.74]  association between the projects but that was like kind of the whole problem yeah yeah and i mean
[1612.74 --> 1620.82]  stream obs is open source yeah like so technically someone else can utilize that code they can utilize
[1620.82 --> 1626.50]  the code base the name is a little the name is pretty freaking iffy yeah so the controversy led obs
[1626.50 --> 1630.90]  developers to share their own woes uh when streamlabs was developing they were approached or they were
[1630.90 --> 1638.26]  uh they were approached about by streamlabs about the use of obs in their name obs declined but
[1638.26 --> 1645.30]  streamlabs went ahead and not only used the name but filed a trademark too very cool which is a super
[1645.30 --> 1651.70]  dick move as it's as it's called in the industry uh prominent streamers like hasanabi and pokimane
[1651.70 --> 1655.86]  spoke out saying that they would no longer use or be affiliated with streamlabs if they didn't resolve the
[1655.86 --> 1661.94]  issue why why do they use streamlabs aren't they like professional streamers no streamlabs like is
[1661.94 --> 1668.26]  like a lot of people use it they do yeah why i don't i i believe the alerts and stuff the integrations
[1668.26 --> 1672.90]  of those things are like easier or something i hate it i don't know i hate it because i'm not used to it
[1672.90 --> 1678.50]  to be fair right okay can i mean floatplane chat like is there a reason to use streamlabs if you're a
[1678.50 --> 1685.54]  new streamer ever like no okay not everyone i bet you epos is watching and he's like i don't and i'm
[1685.54 --> 1692.50]  the i'm the streaming technician guy um but there's a lot of people online that will recommend you just
[1692.50 --> 1697.38]  go to streamlabs because i believe it's kind of a one-stop shop it gets everything going blah blah blah
[1697.38 --> 1704.26]  right okay yeah um convenience i mean i guess for for my part like a lot of the time i will just i mean
[1704.26 --> 1710.58]  i went manjaro right like a lot of the time i'll just be like we also we already used this and we
[1710.58 --> 1717.86]  don't use a lot of the alerts that normal streamers use oh i guess that's fair like we made our own
[1717.86 --> 1725.14]  merch thing right which like wouldn't work with it anyways right okay so i mean no it works with
[1725.14 --> 1729.86]  slobs i just don't think it would work with the streamlabs alerts i just mean my general philosophy is
[1729.86 --> 1733.94]  if i'm gonna have to learn the hard one eventually anyway you just go i might as well just do it now
[1733.94 --> 1739.22]  like it's kind of you know how you know it's like learning physics right where every year you find
[1739.22 --> 1745.38]  out that everything you learned that last year was wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah i could go into a few
[1745.38 --> 1749.86]  stories about that but yes that's absolutely true like what's the point right i might as well just go
[1749.86 --> 1757.22]  hard mode now yeah yeah because you're learning how to learn but yeah yeah exactly um so so okay yeah
[1757.22 --> 1763.06]  fine i guess uh professional streamers use streamlabs obs uh now there's a discussion point here
[1763.94 --> 1773.78]  is i wonder how ncix felt when you stole the tech tips i stole nothing i stole nothing calling it linus
[1773.78 --> 1782.42]  tech tips was actually the ceo of ncix's idea and i bought the linus tech tips channel and trademark and
[1782.42 --> 1792.10]  domain okay i paid a fair price of one dollar canadian it's a canadian canadian dollar it's extremely
[1792.10 --> 1799.86]  expensive channel um now this is interesting this is an interesting talking point streamlabs obs has been
[1799.86 --> 1805.62]  out for almost three years now is obs in the right for airing their dirty laundry now well apparently
[1805.62 --> 1811.86]  behind the scenes they've been doing so for quite a long time uh they they did say no to to using the
[1811.86 --> 1819.86]  name initially um and and and this happens a lot in in modern society actually where there will be
[1819.86 --> 1826.66]  grievances kind of with quite a few people and then one group or one person you'll stand up very loudly
[1826.66 --> 1832.50]  and then all the other voices will join them right so i i mean it's it's fairly standard at this point
[1832.50 --> 1836.90]  so apparently it's been ongoing epos fox has a good video on the subject so you guys can go go
[1836.90 --> 1842.82]  check that out check out uh i'm stunned that epos fox has a video on a streaming subject

[2000.42 --> 2007.38]  it would please me if you would guess it's not very heavy my first is is it a phone no it is not a
[2007.38 --> 2012.66]  phone it's not a phone my first guess was that it was like some weird sandal thing or something
[2012.66 --> 2016.90]  no it's not a single thing that's incorrect can i cheat at all can i like read the back
[2016.90 --> 2031.30]  sure go ahead that doesn't help i think almost at all earphones headphones or earbuds like earbuds what
[2032.50 --> 2039.86]  made in 2019 why do you have these so um i only recently became aware of these
[2039.86 --> 2050.58]  louis vuitton apparently has a true wireless earphone line um that appears to be their own
[2050.58 --> 2055.86]  product as opposed to just really silk screening my logo genuinely really surprising onto something else
[2055.86 --> 2063.54]  well i mean it could be very very oem and just yeah you know branded because i i thought it was going
[2063.54 --> 2069.78]  to be like you know the like designed by mclaren phone no no this is this is actually the
[2069.78 --> 2081.46]  the one you know what could possibly what could possibly justify
[2082.74 --> 2090.98]  the whole no dean hundred dollars oh for wireless earphones wow what could possibly justify it
[2090.98 --> 2100.50]  they don't even look good well that's subjective that's fair i mean they might look good to people
[2100.50 --> 2108.90]  who care more about the logo than the actual industrial design yeah yeah so guys uh i'm really
[2108.90 --> 2113.06]  looking forward to reviewing these i'm actually planning to work on my review i'm going to be stuck
[2113.06 --> 2119.70]  on a plane for 20 hours so i'll have plenty of time to run through the battery and make sure that it's
[2119.70 --> 2125.22]  actually you know as long as they say it is and uh listen to them is that is that unopened yeah
[2126.34 --> 2130.10]  do you want me to open it kind of are you going to do a short circuit should we open it no i'm not
[2130.10 --> 2133.94]  going to do a short circuit i'm planning a full ltt review yeah then let's do it okay all right you

[2139.14 --> 2145.14]  have to we're going to have to experience other aspects of the of like the paper falling out yeah hold on a
[2145.14 --> 2149.94]  second there's a i thought there was a little uh oh i might have actually misplaced part of the
[2150.66 --> 2157.30]  part of the experience drama ah tension yeah there's a little there's a little envelope that
[2157.30 --> 2162.66]  it came with and i honestly have no idea what was in it no no it's not this it's not this it was a
[2162.66 --> 2168.98]  little sealed envelope i'm gonna have to run over to 105 and uh see if i can find that so uh thank you
[2168.98 --> 2173.38]  for shopping with louis vuitton your product has been crafted by experienced artisans with exclusive
[2173.38 --> 2179.54]  materials oh my then packed with the utmost care following strict cemetery guidelines blah blah blah
[2179.54 --> 2188.74]  blah blah blah blah okay so there's that in french uh judging you so hard right now whatever aj every
[2188.74 --> 2199.46]  word what is this uh oh this is my packing slip oh no it's a gift receipt okay all right live unboxing
[2200.02 --> 2204.18]  louis vuitton earphones i actually don't know if that's exactly the model that we got
[2204.18 --> 2210.34]  they apparently have a bunch of them oh what is this there's a thing here oh hold on there's a thing
[2210.34 --> 2216.74]  in here i think this is not what is this but there's nothing there's nothing in here it looked like there
[2216.74 --> 2226.10]  was something in there okay here we go actually it's fun oh oh it opens like that okay oh look at that
[2226.10 --> 2232.02]  the presentation presentation though starts pretty strong okay eco-friendly packaging for the most part
[2232.02 --> 2239.06]  cloth is actually terrible from an uh eco perspective uh especially if it's single use but my my kids will
[2239.06 --> 2245.94]  get plenty of use out of these cute little baggies yeah uh we've got some replacement ear tips so i have
[2245.94 --> 2252.58]  extra small this the presentation falls apart a little bit here this is just standard plastic printed
[2252.58 --> 2258.74]  bags with little ear tips in them extra small large small for whatever has a different color
[2258.74 --> 2263.54]  of printing on it maybe they source those from a different factory or something oh that's weird i
[2263.54 --> 2274.26]  have wait what i have two smalls wait what is sm maybe sm is not small why are they both labeled sm okay
[2274.26 --> 2277.62]  i'm definitely going to talk about that in the video they didn't look the same size to me one of them
[2277.62 --> 2281.78]  no it's a completely different thing yeah one of them seems to be like a wrap for it yeah help hold
[2281.78 --> 2287.94]  it in your ear or something yeah okay so i got that and then what's in the other one i have no idea if
[2287.94 --> 2292.34]  people are even interested in this you know what's the they seem like they what's the unboxing experience
[2292.34 --> 2298.50]  like of a 1500 pair of earbuds really far away okay in the other bag the extra large ear tips are in there
[2298.50 --> 2306.90]  for some reason i don't know why that would be there's a usb a to c adapter and then a c to c
[2306.90 --> 2314.18]  charging cable that actually has a leather wow okay i don't know if it's real leather uh hard to say
[2314.18 --> 2320.26]  is it attached to the cable or does it just fall away it is attached to the cable oh so you've got a
[2320.26 --> 2324.98]  nice little leather i i personally love it when my cable ties are bulkier than they have to be
[2324.98 --> 2332.26]  um that's i'm a big fan of that and obviously we're going to test the lv cable with our cable
[2332.26 --> 2345.78]  ah nice okay obviously so we got our charging cable all right this feels reassuring hold it whoa
[2346.50 --> 2351.38]  it's heavy right how much of that is this container though oh almost all of it i would hope i mean is
[2351.38 --> 2356.42]  this a charging does this charge i have no idea hold on there's more there's more stuff in here
[2356.42 --> 2360.58]  the battery it it has some like you guys aren't gonna be able to hear it or anything but it has
[2360.58 --> 2364.82]  some weight in it for sure uh there's a little it's got some weight to it does anyone understand
[2364.82 --> 2369.78]  that envelope with a cleaning cloth oh i can't open it cleaning cloth i mean that's like uh that's
[2369.78 --> 2373.22]  like a hundred and whatever dollar value how much does apple charge for their cleaning cloth is it
[2373.22 --> 2382.02]  15 bucks i don't remember i i hold on how much uh how much is apples cleaning cloth i thought it was
[2382.02 --> 2388.74]  like ludicrously expensive or something oh no it's like 25 canadian okay uh 19 us sorry i i i must have
[2388.74 --> 2396.50]  added a zero to the to the stupid price tag okay then we've got a manual all right cool and uh this is
[2396.50 --> 2402.34]  it this is the moment luke i can't believe how freaking heavy it's heavy i feel like there's battery in
[2402.34 --> 2406.34]  there i think that's a charging case which is actually kind of cool nice quality nice quality
[2406.34 --> 2418.02]  zipper okay oh no this is just a case for the case oh wow um okay oh packaging made in china of course it
[2418.02 --> 2423.70]  is um so what am i going to do with this i mean again my girls would would love this can you remove
[2423.70 --> 2431.54]  the lid of that case while it's in the blue one uh that's a good question so oh okay so it's like a
[2431.54 --> 2436.74]  a case for your case so that you can case while you case uh they didn't really apparently think of
[2436.74 --> 2443.54]  that no it um it kind of lifts it out yeah that's a bad experience that's not the greatest um so this
[2443.54 --> 2449.94]  is like honestly sort of almost a completely pointless yeah and then they have a window on
[2449.94 --> 2457.38]  their charging case which is pretty bulky unless you also own a purse which i'm sure they'd be happy to
[2457.38 --> 2463.22]  sell you um at a pretty good profit margin oh yeah um definitely you're not going to be carrying this
[2463.22 --> 2470.02]  around with you easily it's pretty pretty bulky uh here are the earphones themselves the window looks
[2470.02 --> 2476.58]  kind of nice yeah the window is kind of kind of classy actually it appears to be glass oh not like uh
[2476.58 --> 2482.26]  plastic all right and the magnet or the hinge or something on that movement seems pretty intense
[2482.26 --> 2489.14]  yeah yeah feels pretty good feels pretty good okay and then uh this is the first time i have ever
[2489.78 --> 2497.62]  paid for a louis vuitton anything i promise you that so this is my this is my first okay i'm a louis
[2497.62 --> 2506.18]  vuitton virgin here we go how do i look yeah i don't think that looks cool or good at all
[2506.18 --> 2516.42]  i'm just like i don't know i'm not exactly uh uh you know fashionista or anything but wow not into it
[2516.42 --> 2522.82]  all right well it does look different all it cost me was 1500 would make you stand out which i believe
[2522.82 --> 2529.46]  is a big part of the point i believe is a big part of the point hearing hearing me and luke talk about
[2529.46 --> 2537.30]  like the point of luxury goods is probably not an experience anyone was hoping for or needed on the
[2537.30 --> 2543.38]  land show today yeah yeah uh there's gonna be a full video of it i'm gonna be evaluating them from a
[2543.38 --> 2548.98]  from a performance perspective and you guys know how much you know i care about the additional
[2550.50 --> 2555.62]  little leather leather blue pouch that it comes with or whatever yeah i expect them to sound
[2555.62 --> 2562.50]  10 times better than airpods pros they have to or eight times or whatever the math works out to be
[2562.50 --> 2569.78]  seven times i don't know unless that really weird red box on your head is uh is worth the additional
[2569.78 --> 2579.70]  cost but you know what maybe it is i don't know not for me all right um so i i have not i have not
[2579.70 --> 2586.34]  looked into these very much some people are some people are sort of really uh really concerned about
[2586.34 --> 2591.30]  the amount of money i spent on them okay so guys first of all i'm gonna make a video about it so this
[2591.30 --> 2598.10]  is an investment second of all i'm going to sell these and hopefully i can find someone almost as
[2598.10 --> 2604.90]  stupid as me to pay almost as much as i did and then it's all good yeah right yeah should be no problem
[2604.90 --> 2611.14]  there's like probably better ear tips you can get anyways jia jangmyeon says so no lv sponsor for linus
[2612.02 --> 2619.22]  yeah i don't think that that was ever a possibility i mean when it comes to luxury brands they want
[2619.22 --> 2628.34]  nothing to do with tech bros like me because we do not give two hoots about the like cool font that you
[2628.34 --> 2633.70]  use to print your name on stuff yeah it's it better have a performance story i mean that's one of the
[2633.70 --> 2639.94]  things that i talked to the merch team for us about a lot is like what is what is the point what is the
[2639.94 --> 2645.86]  point of anything we're doing and sometimes the point can be memes lol banana no problem yeah but there
[2645.86 --> 2655.62]  has to be some kind of point absolutely rod rod rosenberg's in chat oh sup rod and rod said i thought
[2655.62 --> 2662.42]  this was pretty funny luke has a hard time spending money on stuff at princess auto yeah it sounds about right
[2662.42 --> 2670.34]  right to be clear i have no problem spending money but i don't like wasting it yeah so yeah you know
[2670.34 --> 2676.58]  i i actually posted on twitter recently i decided to i decided to influencer flex for a change because
[2676.58 --> 2683.14]  it's not really something that i do that often like usually anytime we're doing anything even the gold xbox
[2683.14 --> 2691.70]  controller had to have an roi pitch internally like we don't just do stuff for the lulz and while we
[2691.70 --> 2697.54]  didn't end up being able to sell it the absolute worst case scenario for it is we melt it down and
[2697.54 --> 2703.86]  we still own a gigantic chunk of gold which last i checked is still doing pretty okay not bad so like
[2705.06 --> 2713.70]  it's fine it's fine um but i decided to influencer flex and post that i bought a gym there have been
[2713.70 --> 2721.14]  some super chats asking about the gym so the deal with the gym is that real estate in vancouver is has
[2721.14 --> 2727.94]  been a pretty good investment it's happening um particularly industrial um it's something that i
[2727.94 --> 2735.22]  have not only wanted for a really long time but it's something that i have had i mean i'm not going to
[2735.22 --> 2743.78]  use the n-word uh i have don't need it um but i have had a really difficult time getting my girls
[2743.78 --> 2748.58]  started on badminton because there hasn't been anywhere to play due to all the restrictions on
[2748.58 --> 2754.66]  gym spaces particularly municipally managed ones that have made it pretty much impossible to just
[2754.66 --> 2760.98]  go in and occupy space and not be using court time efficiently um i really want to get them started
[2760.98 --> 2766.18]  they're already you know two years behind when i started my son and the last thing i want is for
[2766.18 --> 2771.86]  my daughters to be like hey we couldn't help noticing that you know when it comes to trying to
[2772.58 --> 2778.42]  do this particular father kid activity you really gave our brother all the attention like that is not
[2779.14 --> 2787.06]  that is not the goal yeah um so i want to get them started on that it's also i think it has the
[2787.06 --> 2793.54]  potential to be a really cool employee benefit so it's something that we we bought as a thing that
[2793.54 --> 2798.42]  everyone who works at liners media group float plane and creator warehouse can use it's only about six
[2798.42 --> 2804.26]  minutes from our office which is pretty cool i think and we're not going to just have a badminton
[2804.26 --> 2808.66]  court in there so the idea is to have uh badminton we'll have badminton lines on the floor and we'll
[2808.66 --> 2812.66]  have a net that can kind of be shoved over to the side and i want to have all kinds of stuff there
[2812.66 --> 2816.74]  so there's a little bit of space kind of at the front of the unit out of the way of the court where we
[2816.74 --> 2822.74]  could have you know i don't know rowing machine bicycles weights stuff like that um i'd love to
[2822.74 --> 2827.78]  have just like you know some balls like play some place have some nets play some indoor soccer yeah
[2827.78 --> 2833.86]  you know uh slap around some some some ball hockey balls what's a ball hockey ball called hockey ball
[2833.86 --> 2839.62]  i don't think you call it a hockey ball it's just a ball sure but it's a hockey ball the orange one
[2839.62 --> 2843.14]  you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah you know slap around some hockey balls put some
[2843.14 --> 2847.14]  basketball nets up like people want to just go chill yeah i think people just got i'm trying to
[2847.14 --> 2852.18]  remember now i think people just call it ball i don't think it has like i think it's a ball hockey
[2852.18 --> 2857.14]  ball yeah i don't know i don't know it's probably more specifically like what it is but i don't think
[2857.14 --> 2861.38]  i ever heard anyone call it anything else if you went to like sports check to buy one and yeah it's
[2861.38 --> 2866.58]  probably so aj is apparently salty that he can't use the gym uh aj i have offered to pay your moving
[2866.58 --> 2872.98]  expenses many times for a lot of years so i don't even want to hear about it yeah aj aj you have you
[2872.98 --> 2878.98]  have uh at one point in time there was almost a ice cream delivery robot in the mix i don't even
[2878.98 --> 2885.54]  remember know if you remember that um what yeah we were it was mostly a meme but we were trying to
[2885.54 --> 2889.94]  we were trying to get aj to move over and he wanted like incentives and i was asking him like what
[2889.94 --> 2894.34]  do you actually want uh you couldn't come up with anything so he ended up coming up with like a robot that
[2894.34 --> 2900.18]  would deliver him ice cream while he was working and i was like okay but i was joking yes because
[2900.18 --> 2910.26]  i'm not doing that yeah um all right cool uh moving on nft bay sure let's talk nft bay yeah um kind of
[2910.26 --> 2916.58]  funny it's an art project it's i i believe it does actually work um but i don't i don't necessarily
[2916.58 --> 2922.66]  expect it to like stay around forever or anything uh there's over 20 terabytes of nfts that have been
[2922.66 --> 2929.22]  right click saved from the ethereum and solana blockchains uh the website gives you free access
[2929.22 --> 2938.26]  to as many crypto punks and lazy lions as you could ever want and everything else um i i i believe it
[2938.26 --> 2945.70]  he he says somewhere that it's like trying to bring to light um like what what nfts actually are and how
[2945.70 --> 2953.54]  a lot of the images associated with nfts are are hosted on like web 2 style uh storage spaces without
[2953.54 --> 2960.66]  guaranteed longevity of storage so the actual reference might 404 eventually and and some other
[2960.66 --> 2968.18]  weird stuff like that um but that's that's honestly about it it's interesting in an artistic sense and in
[2968.18 --> 2972.58]  a tech sense and a few other different ways but there isn't really a ton to say about it and we probably
[2972.58 --> 2979.70]  can't put it up on screen because there are some lewd nfts and we don't know necessarily what's going
[2979.70 --> 2985.38]  to show up if we load the page uh and do know that before you go to the website if you are planning on
[2985.38 --> 2993.86]  going there as well um someone said only about 10 gigabytes well rip the notes uh but there's there's a
[2994.82 --> 3000.10]  an amount i don't know you know what i'm feeling lucky you're going for it there's an i'm feeling lucky
[3000.10 --> 3007.22]  so oh okay pirate nft search i mean i don't know picture if i just search for picture i'm feeling lucky
[3007.22 --> 3014.26]  what's the first picture i'm gonna get okay i didn't get anything too incriminating so here's some pirate
[3014.26 --> 3025.54]  nfts we've got a pirate pikachu uh whatever this is it's a picture yep the the whole point of the stuff isn't
[3025.54 --> 3032.26]  isn't the actual picture an argument that is brought up often is um you can go to the the
[3032.26 --> 3037.62]  louvre and take a picture of mona lisa it doesn't mean you own the mona lisa blah blah blah blah blah
[3037.62 --> 3045.06]  yeah oh that is unfortunate okay see you later was there something bad i mean i don't know if i would
[3045.06 --> 3050.02]  describe it as bad it was pretty tasteful oh okay um all right here you can have a look at it if you want
[3050.02 --> 3057.54]  that's fine it's on my screen i'll see you later all right it's uh oh my i mean it's unique
[3058.74 --> 3067.14]  yeah so there's that it yeah because it's uh yeah all right cool see nice uh but yeah um it's
[3067.14 --> 3072.82]  interesting it's if you're if you're into if you've been paying attention to you know nft kind of stuff
[3072.82 --> 3077.70]  it's it's an interesting development i find it interesting that the dude's name is very notably
[3077.70 --> 3083.70]  attached to it yeah like he has an faq on his on his github and he's like he's a person who's been
[3083.70 --> 3094.66]  around um like it's this is not his first rodeo um so yeah that that i find very surprising um and
[3094.66 --> 3104.18]  we'll see where that goes but that's about it okay cool in other fun exciting amazing news um i don't know
[3104.18 --> 3110.58]  which one to go with halo infinite halo infinite it's back yes halo's back baby have you played so
[3110.58 --> 3116.34]  cool yeah not a huge amount but i have played and it's fun the my the main two things that i'm excited
[3116.34 --> 3121.70]  about aren't out yet but what's really exciting right now is the foundation is absolutely there
[3122.26 --> 3128.66]  the game feels great it looks great one thing that was just deeply refreshing for me personally
[3128.66 --> 3133.78]  um i don't know why i care so much about this and this hasn't been a thing for a long time i think i've
[3133.78 --> 3140.90]  just been so frustrated by modern very very modern last few years uis yeah that the ui the you load up
[3140.90 --> 3149.22]  the game and it's just immediately beautiful right like there's been so many games where like you start
[3149.22 --> 3155.38]  out in some basement and i don't even mean that i mean you launch the game you haven't clicked anything
[3155.38 --> 3162.50]  yet and it's stunning right like the backdrop is is absolutely fantastic all the ui elements the gui
[3162.50 --> 3167.06]  are really beautiful i know jayden had some feedback about not being able to find things super
[3167.06 --> 3170.42]  well i didn't really care i just immediately went into a match because i don't really care about
[3170.42 --> 3175.78]  customizing my spartan too much sorry if for the three four three people that worked on that i'm just
[3175.78 --> 3182.42]  whatever i'm sure it's great um but yeah it it feels really good the gun playing stuff is really good um
[3182.42 --> 3187.62]  um i i found some feedback from certain people online that i think haven't played halo in a long
[3187.62 --> 3192.10]  time yeah uh to be kind of funny they're like wow the time to kill is really long and i'm like
[3192.66 --> 3200.18]  halo halo halo yeah that's the thing um that you better put a full magazine of needlers needles
[3200.18 --> 3204.58]  to your opponent yeah the whole idea is supposed to be that it's kind of hard to take a spartan down
[3204.58 --> 3209.54]  you're fighting other spartans so it's pretty hard to take a spartan down um i think a lot of other
[3209.54 --> 3214.26]  people have also forgotten that in halo the the shields and the health are actually two very
[3214.26 --> 3220.18]  different things yeah and like if you remember i think i played a lot of halo 2 personally that was
[3220.18 --> 3225.30]  my main halo game um and i know in halo 2 especially the plasma pistol battle rifle combo
[3225.86 --> 3229.86]  was like kingly because if you had a fully charged plasma pistol and you could hit someone with it
[3229.86 --> 3235.14]  the shields are gone yeah and then you could triple shot br to the head and it's just over and there
[3235.14 --> 3240.34]  isn't exactly it doesn't really feel like there's exactly that combination right now um but you do
[3240.34 --> 3244.34]  need to mix up the weapons if you use like covenant weapons they're better at taking down the shields and
[3244.34 --> 3248.42]  you use human weapons that are better at taking down the hp whatever i don't know it feels really
[3248.42 --> 3255.14]  really good there's been some complaints out there that the battle pass progression is like not great or
[3255.14 --> 3260.74]  something again this is something i really don't care about right because it's cosmetic items and i'm i just
[3260.74 --> 3267.14]  i'm just trying to shoot some stuff um but microsoft has already responded they've already been working
[3267.14 --> 3273.54]  on it um they've they've given like apology rewards they did a really really quick stopgap solution of
[3273.54 --> 3279.86]  making it so that there was a challenge of just play a game yeah you just do repeatedly over and over and
[3279.86 --> 3284.58]  over again for points right okay um so that there was like you could progress a little bit easier right
[3284.58 --> 3288.58]  away and then they're working on a more long-term solution and they've they've given some reward for
[3288.58 --> 3295.38]  people for dealing with it which is great it's free to play which has its positives and negatives
[3295.38 --> 3300.82]  sure any every positive is that it's free the negatives are everything else yeah pretty much
[3301.46 --> 3307.46]  every modern game even like forza like a racing game has like rampant cheating in it like cheating
[3307.46 --> 3314.18]  in the modern era is insane and it's it's worst in the fps space um so having it free to play makes
[3314.18 --> 3319.94]  that even easier but it also massively increases the player base which is very good for a multiplayer
[3319.94 --> 3326.34]  game so yeah i don't know uh but yeah the two features that i am most excited for are both not in
[3326.34 --> 3332.10]  the game right now which is co-op and forge a lot of my favorite experiences in halo are not playing the game
[3332.10 --> 3338.42]  in just like a quick match format yeah so i'm really excited about forge yeah and then
[3341.22 --> 3346.42]  another massive amount of what i like halo for is co-op campaign that's also not in the game yet yeah
[3346.98 --> 3351.94]  i'll i'll i'll i'll load it up i'll download it once co-op's available because realistically i'm not
[3351.94 --> 3358.18]  going to play a competitive shooter these days i'm not i've i was never very good and i'm especially
[3358.18 --> 3365.62]  not very good the older i get so i just don't get a lot of enjoyment out of walking around on
[3366.18 --> 3371.94]  the map for four seconds getting headshot from someone i can't even see by some dude who's
[3371.94 --> 3376.10]  memorized all the locations of all the sniper spawns and whatever else yeah i'm definitely
[3376.10 --> 3382.18]  more excited for the other modes like i don't have i like as long as it's not shroud or something
[3382.18 --> 3388.66]  which i've literally tried to do you know i am i am pretty comfortable just you know trying to shoot
[3388.66 --> 3393.46]  a guy who's trying to shoot me at the same time but for me i don't have the time at this stage in
[3393.46 --> 3401.06]  my life to like you said memorize all the routes that someone might take and do all that research
[3401.06 --> 3406.66]  right like watching youtube videos where people are doing this kind of hardcore analysis okay at the
[3406.66 --> 3411.38]  moment of spawn you need to basically start counting four and a half seconds and if you can get to this
[3411.38 --> 3415.62]  point before that they can't hit you so you can get set up so you can just slide down this thing
[3415.62 --> 3419.46]  and get in position and if they've gone this way you'll probably be able to get like three free kills
[3422.10 --> 3427.86]  i can't yeah i'm sorry i can't yeah that's like all all my favorite stuff in halo is just playing
[3427.86 --> 3433.14]  with friends not online matchmaking personally like like blood gulch with some buddies and you're even
[3433.14 --> 3440.02]  good at video games so that's like a very different video games to get over it um what was i what was i
[3440.02 --> 3445.46]  trying to say there's oh yeah this is an interesting time y'all have been watching me for years yeah
[3445.46 --> 3451.14]  you did and okay you can't even say that because you did that challenge what for people to come play
[3451.14 --> 3456.66]  you in video games and you just trashed yeah but those were like nobody's no offense you're lovely
[3456.66 --> 3463.54]  people that's the audience man i know and they're wonderful and i love them and you beat them well
[3463.54 --> 3471.70]  yeah but they like they they weren't i'm not saying you're shroud no you're not but i don't think
[3471.70 --> 3479.30]  nobody is i yeah well it's not that i'm good it's that conrad says i would destroy linus 1v1 in any
[3479.30 --> 3484.26]  game i don't know if that's true i think it might be a lot of games because conrad's one one heck of a
[3484.26 --> 3489.94]  yeah any game i think is probably a bit of a stretch conrad you wanna you wanna put lunch on that
[3489.94 --> 3494.42]  because i'm pretty sure i can find a game that i can absolutely shit wreck you at
[3498.82 --> 3504.10]  epic uh he's probably gonna take that um what was i gonna buy me lunch is what he's gonna do
[3505.94 --> 3512.02]  um man i had some oh right this is an interesting topic and one that i've been somewhat bottling
[3512.02 --> 3516.50]  but with the release of halo infinite i just can't do it anymore because i didn't want people to jump
[3516.50 --> 3522.82]  on this negatively because of the linux challenge yeah but this has been a bit of an interesting year
[3522.82 --> 3527.94]  with gaming there's been a lot there's been some good releases there has been there's been a lot of
[3527.94 --> 3532.90]  really subpar releases a lot of people have been pointing and saying like this is kind of the
[3532.90 --> 3538.50]  releases that are coming from covid it makes sense there's a lot of disruption in studios etc etc it's
[3538.50 --> 3546.18]  like okay okay okay there's been quite a few not what we were hoping for games microsoft out of
[3546.18 --> 3554.58]  freaking nowhere drops three bangers at the end of the year right age of empires 4 yep forza horizon 5
[3554.58 --> 3559.78]  halo infinite each one of them the communities are very happy with it that's the thing that matters
[3559.78 --> 3564.90]  the most to me i believe they're all like selling well as well but the communities are happy with all of
[3564.90 --> 3570.50]  those and like the chance that you were gonna piss off the age of empires community with a bad release
[3570.50 --> 3577.38]  was really extremely high it's really so long and the games are so beloved and that's also true for
[3577.38 --> 3585.30]  halo yep that's a lot i think the expectations were lower for him that's probably fair i mean age of
[3585.30 --> 3592.02]  empires 3 was a solid entry in that series yes the quality a little down the quality of aoe had not
[3592.02 --> 3599.62]  really plummeted you know yeah so that i think no i think age of empires and forza were much higher
[3599.62 --> 3605.30]  risk than halo but halo is obviously going to be the bigger mover in terms of it being a more popular
[3605.30 --> 3611.22]  gaming genre in general yeah so the fact that they got them all right is extremely impressive maybe just
[3611.22 --> 3618.58]  buying every game studio is a strategy i know bethesda had nothing to do with any of them yeah yeah
[3618.58 --> 3624.82]  but i and i think like something else that i want to give them praise for as well which i don't think
[3624.82 --> 3631.86]  it was in the notes here but it was in my my tweet feed was the stability of that launch right it was
[3631.86 --> 3637.94]  like a a what do you call it a surprise launch as far as my understanding goes they just kind of dropped
[3637.94 --> 3645.06]  it out of nowhere but i also believe there was like a mass i think peak concurrence for like 250 300k on the
[3645.06 --> 3650.34]  first day or something um that's peak concurrence not total amount of players to be clear and as far
[3650.34 --> 3654.66]  as my understanding goes their multiplayer was completely fine the whole time you contrast that
[3654.66 --> 3661.38]  with the owners of aws launching new world and just completely yeah how embarrassing everywhere it's i
[3661.38 --> 3667.30]  don't know it's it's really it's quite impressive to see microsoft game studios kind of come out of
[3667.30 --> 3671.86]  nowhere because i don't someone might be able to correct me here maybe i'm wrong maybe i haven't been
[3671.86 --> 3676.42]  paying enough attention but for the last while i don't think there's been strong microsoft game
[3676.42 --> 3682.02]  releases microsoft game studios releases for the horizon 4 was pretty successful that's true but
[3682.02 --> 3686.98]  like that long ago i believe almost every forza horizon which is borderline just a copy paste of
[3686.98 --> 3693.22]  the previous game has also always done well um that's fair it's kind of hard to go wrong when you're
[3693.22 --> 3699.46]  just selling people essentially nfts of cars okay they're not nfts because they're not even unique so get
[3699.46 --> 3703.70]  wrecked no they're very easy to get it's a fun game it's fun game i'm not trash on it i'm just
[3703.70 --> 3709.54]  saying it's a it's a bit of an easy win yeah that's fair that's fair the game looks beautiful
[3709.54 --> 3714.82]  and you race cars that are really fast and they give you lots of dopamine hits by giving you lots of
[3715.38 --> 3723.46]  spins and free cars and money and blah blah blah blah um so yeah i don't know flight simulator yeah
[3723.46 --> 3729.54]  that's fair yeah yeah flight simulator was a big big w um anyways either way i just found that pretty
[3729.54 --> 3736.10]  interesting windows on the other hand i noticed that conrad has not responded to my challenge yet
[3736.10 --> 3741.30]  so conrad let me know if you accept and i will choose a game and you will be embarrassed
[3743.14 --> 3749.38]  i promise uh why don't we talk about the fall of activision blizzard shall we okay yeah this is
[3749.38 --> 3753.54]  another really fun one for me it's at the point now where microsoft had to issue a statement saying
[3753.54 --> 3757.38]  that they're gonna have to evaluate their relationship with activision moving forward
[3757.38 --> 3762.58]  like this is finally getting the momentum that it deserves and that's not just blizzard right
[3762.58 --> 3769.86]  because bobby kodak is the the ceo of activision blizzard so that's that's includes cod is essentially
[3769.86 --> 3775.06]  what i'm trying to get at because when this first when i first read that i was like oh why does that
[3775.06 --> 3780.90]  matter microsoft doesn't do much with like hearthstone or wow or whatever else but that yeah
[3780.90 --> 3785.62]  that includes cod that's a big deal when you're talking about consoles playstation has also had some
[3785.62 --> 3792.50]  murmurs about similar things as well um so this is this is a big pressure for a massive moving game
[3792.50 --> 3797.86]  which is call of duty um more than 800 i believe it's significantly more than that at this point
[3797.86 --> 3802.90]  activision blizzard employees and contractors have signed a petition calling for ceo bobby kodak to be
[3802.90 --> 3810.18]  removed good uh apparently he knew about all the alleged rapes and other sexual misconducts for
[3810.18 --> 3816.02]  years if not the entire time uh he allegedly told an employee that he would have her killed
[3816.74 --> 3821.38]  i don't remember all the details behind that i did read that i just don't remember this moment
[3821.38 --> 3828.66]  i believe he might have done something to her directly i don't remember don't quote me on that um i i
[3828.66 --> 3832.18]  i know the the quote of saying that he was going to have her killed was a thing i just don't
[3832.18 --> 3836.34]  remember the context around why i don't know if she knew things or things were done to her or what
[3836.34 --> 3842.98]  there's kind of no good reason no i'm just trying to yeah yeah yeah yeah that's totally very clear
[3842.98 --> 3848.66]  yes uh it has also been reported that he's likely the one who penned the original email to employees
[3848.66 --> 3856.74]  claiming uh all of these recent articles were false or only partially true um good guy uh the petition also
[3856.74 --> 3862.74]  calls for a new ceo to be chosen without kodak's influence um he has substantial portion of the
[3862.74 --> 3867.46]  voting rights of the shareholders he owns a lot of the company uh the board of directors made a statement
[3867.46 --> 3872.02]  on tuesday uh the goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious the board remains
[3872.02 --> 3878.66]  confident in bobby kodak's leadership commitment and ability to achieve these goals uh this contrasts
[3878.66 --> 3888.74]  very strongly the no tolerance policy that blizzard recently pushed out which is not applying to bobby
[3888.74 --> 3899.30]  kodak um the rat it's horrible get him out he's terrible i've been trying to push this for i think
[3899.30 --> 3905.14]  like two months now or more more than that i think yeah like you know this dude knew what was going on it
[3905.14 --> 3910.02]  it should have been so clear from the start i'm very happy this came out he has a history of this
[3910.02 --> 3918.98]  type of stuff i found it it's not hard to find it's on wikipedia uh with citations yes yes which is key
[3918.98 --> 3928.18]  yeah um like i just just stop just stop i don't even know what else to say this is just horrible get him
[3928.18 --> 3934.18]  out of there clean it all up blizzard needs like blizzard needs to fall back and regroup in a like
[3934.18 --> 3944.66]  really intense way um yeah yeah all right um hey we sent out a new ltd store newsletter if you're
[3944.66 --> 3951.30]  not subscribed to it already i will take a look at it for you look we're gonna have a new sticker pack
[3951.30 --> 3958.82]  for next year cool i i actually love love these um this is this is going to be a pin soon sarah designed
[3958.82 --> 3965.54]  a pin based on this graphic uh what else we got in here hey look look there's a classic got the linus
[3965.54 --> 3971.62]  and luke uh couch thing it actually was going to be a fist bump but i had concerns about the sticker
[3971.62 --> 3976.02]  ripping where the fists meet oh and i didn't want to just have like a big ugly border around it so
[3976.98 --> 3982.26]  um those are cool it's gotten to the point where i get involved in like a lot of like very random
[3982.26 --> 3988.50]  little things um sort of running the company uh fortunately none of those things involve um
[3989.14 --> 3997.78]  me needing to be to be ousted which is good yay not bobby kodick yeah very nice i've set a very low
[3997.78 --> 4004.74]  bar for myself be better than bobby kodick yeah um so that's neat
[4004.74 --> 4011.14]  neat apparently yeah someone someone actually brought up in flow plane chat and i remember
[4011.14 --> 4014.98]  reading about this as well yeah one of the problems that they're having right now is that buying him
[4014.98 --> 4023.70]  out um would be so costly and difficult um and that there's potential i don't know if this was true or
[4023.70 --> 4029.14]  not right again there's a few things in here that like this news hasn't marinated enough to really
[4029.86 --> 4035.14]  know all what what out of all of it is like super legit uh but i think there's a clause in his
[4035.14 --> 4040.58]  contract that like makes him additionally very difficult to get rid of great outside of just
[4040.58 --> 4046.50]  needing to buy out his extremely substantial amount of shares um so i i suspect there's something going
[4046.50 --> 4053.14]  on there i suspect that's why the zero tolerance policy found a very quick found out very quickly that
[4053.14 --> 4060.98]  it's not exactly zero um yeah all right we should probably do some merch messages because there are
[4060.98 --> 4066.02]  some really good questions here some of them are not really good questions are just ones that i had
[4066.02 --> 4072.82]  meant to uh pop up on the thing but i didn't catch it in time because the uh the delay is not long enough
[4075.54 --> 4082.98]  um jersey statham says the subliminal messaging finally activated in my brain love it you were a little slow
[4083.14 --> 4090.98]  um slow on the uptake but that's good eventually we got through to you that's the goal um james m says
[4090.98 --> 4097.70]  celebrating getting my daily driver to number 20 25 in times by extreme on hardware bot pretty freaking
[4097.70 --> 4102.98]  awesome looking forward to the uh air-conditioned daily driver that you guys teased last week yeah
[4102.98 --> 4111.86]  that's going to be a heck of a video lots of lots of fun me and alex um oh my goodness okay guys when i
[4111.86 --> 4116.18]  announce that we're talking about them is not the time to place orders it's the time for you to have
[4116.18 --> 4125.46]  already placed an order uh all right i because we can't do all of them uh michael v says in terms
[4125.46 --> 4129.94]  of environmental impact i love what microsoft did with the ocean plastic mouse but if they cared
[4129.94 --> 4135.70]  wouldn't it be in more flagship devices than anyone actually wants um yeah i think that's a very good
[4135.70 --> 4141.78]  point however one of the challenges around sustainable materials can actually be getting enough of it
[4141.78 --> 4151.14]  because yeah you can only make what happens to exist right so you don't necessarily want your
[4151.14 --> 4156.26]  flagship product that you're going to make the most of to be made out of a material that you can only get
[4156.26 --> 4163.54]  if other people like waste and throw away other stuff yeah so that's that's tough um yeah
[4165.70 --> 4170.02]  uh jonathan a says you said before a big issue with some distros is you can brick them just by
[4170.02 --> 4175.46]  updating well i mean i wasn't generalizing about that i just happened to have that problem garuda
[4175.46 --> 4180.74]  actually creates a restore point at each update um that's fair although my issue oh it apparently gives
[4180.74 --> 4185.22]  an option to restore it before the os boots okay that's super cool uh also says i'm visually impaired
[4185.22 --> 4191.38]  can you make merch messages visible at cart um i'm not sure if i quite understand the question i don't
[4191.38 --> 4198.74]  can you make them visible at cart um i'm sorry i'm not yeah maybe someone in floatplane chat chat can
[4199.30 --> 4206.18]  or fire uh this is not technically a message to support i guess yeah but you should send it to
[4206.18 --> 4212.26]  floatplane support yeah support at floatplane.com yeah um i know that's like kind of odd but yeah send it there
[4213.06 --> 4219.78]  uh matthew asks what are my thoughts on the channel super fun house video um matthew says best
[4219.78 --> 4226.74]  channel super fun video ever imo better than nerd sports i have not watched it so dennis and ethan
[4226.74 --> 4233.54]  asked me if i could not watch it so that i could do a reaction video and so we haven't had a chance
[4233.54 --> 4239.06]  this week's been super busy gearing up for my trip i haven't traveled in a while so all the kind of the
[4239.06 --> 4246.26]  the workflows are a little rusty okay it's been a couple years actually and uh we just haven't gotten
[4246.26 --> 4251.78]  it together so i'm gonna sit down i'm gonna i'm gonna watch it and you guys will get to hear all
[4251.78 --> 4259.30]  of my thoughts as i go through it i will say i was straight up stunned that it took so long for me
[4259.30 --> 4265.54]  to find them yeah which i was like i had i had to yeah i had to put myself in your shoes a few times
[4265.54 --> 4272.26]  because i'd be like oh that was the mistake he's got him and then you wouldn't get them but i had to
[4272.26 --> 4277.14]  kind of think like okay you've got kids in the house you're probably used to these like random
[4277.14 --> 4283.22]  noises all the time like yeah like stuff moves around in my house my wallet was missing for three
[4283.22 --> 4290.42]  months because my daughter put it in her school backpack so at the end of the school year it was
[4290.42 --> 4296.18]  just in there i had no reason to open that we didn't find it till september oh my goodness and i was
[4296.18 --> 4302.10]  sure that it hadn't left the house because i hadn't left the house so i was like well it's
[4302.10 --> 4307.70]  here somewhere like unless it was stolen by the insulation guys that are working on the insulation
[4307.70 --> 4312.26]  in the roof which i don't think it was they seem like good blokes then it's in here somewhere so i
[4312.26 --> 4316.42]  didn't replace any of my cards thankfully yeah because i knew i had it it was just a matter of
[4316.42 --> 4321.06]  where it searched the house high and low so many times i was driving around with no license for like
[4322.02 --> 4328.82]  almost three months why well that's not good i mean i have a license i just the air tag wasn't on me i
[4328.82 --> 4335.94]  thought was pretty interesting so so i i i've read some of the comments on it so i do know some stuff
[4336.98 --> 4345.22]  i legitimately blanked it looked like an air tag to me but it didn't compute have you ever have you
[4345.22 --> 4351.94]  ever seen someone that you know well but in a context where you wouldn't as easily recognize
[4351.94 --> 4360.02]  them and it taken a while yeah so i tend because your brain's like that can't be i tend to be a very
[4360.02 --> 4367.86]  associative uh i tend to have a very associative memory so if i had seen that thing on jonathan horst's
[4367.86 --> 4376.02]  desk i don't okay yeah boom oh you're working on an air tag video yeah i don't own an air i've seen air tags
[4376.58 --> 4386.42]  twice once um dbrand sent them as like a sponsor spot and i looked at it and one other time when i
[4386.42 --> 4395.54]  looked at apple's event that's it i don't use them i don't own any um so so when i pulled that thing out of
[4395.54 --> 4402.26]  my pocket i was like oh this looks like an air tag but there's no reason that an air tag should be in
[4402.26 --> 4407.94]  my pocket i'll put this down and i'll figure it out later i'll deal with it later and because it had
[4407.94 --> 4413.70]  the dbrand sticker on it none of the apple branding was visible so i thought conceivably it could be some
[4414.50 --> 4421.06]  weird little thing that my daughters have that has like a picture of it's like a little like toy or
[4421.06 --> 4426.26]  like a tiddly wink like i didn't know what it was i was just like oh yeah there's like this thing in
[4426.26 --> 4430.90]  my pocket i'll deal with this later so i hacked it on my nightstand because i was like there's no
[4430.90 --> 4439.54]  reason for this to be in my pocket um if i had if i had thought even if i thought this is what do you
[4439.54 --> 4443.54]  think from that yeah i wouldn't have i honestly wouldn't have thought anything of it i'd have thought
[4443.54 --> 4448.50]  oh this made its way you must have like seen it somewhere weird and picked it up maybe one of the
[4448.50 --> 4454.82]  camera guys put one in one of the camera bags so that we wouldn't lose our camera bag for some
[4454.82 --> 4459.30]  reason and then left it in there and it fell out when they were at the house people come in and out
[4459.30 --> 4464.02]  of my house all the time with tech crap maybe it fell out and maybe one of my kids was playing with
[4464.02 --> 4470.98]  it and it ended up in my pants that is a perfectly that is a perfectly conceivable way that an air tag
[4470.98 --> 4478.42]  could have gone from jonathan horst's desk to my pants pocket entirely innocently and i just it's
[4479.22 --> 4488.10]  i got my weekend brain on like yeah yeah there's people that on account of that and i i think some
[4488.10 --> 4496.42]  other things are sure that it is staged and i'm like oh i yeah i'm sure it wasn't yeah i i yeah not
[4496.42 --> 4501.22]  only did i know that it wasn't because i was actually supposed to be a part of it yeah i don't know if you
[4501.22 --> 4505.62]  even knew that part uh no they told me that they told me that yeah yeah they didn't make it that far
[4505.62 --> 4512.26]  i'm not surprised guys could have done a better job they were trying to make it interesting which is
[4512.90 --> 4519.54]  i mean the job i get it i mean it worked it's the first banger channel super fun that we've had
[4519.54 --> 4524.18]  in a very long it's a fun watch and it's a fun they they did a fantastic job like i'm looking at the
[4524.18 --> 4534.34]  analytics and it's uh it's gone from kind of like leveling off to schwamp algorithm do like yeah so
[4534.34 --> 4541.62]  it's it's going now great job ethan and dennis um i did see one comment that they were surprised at
[4541.62 --> 4548.66]  my reaction to finding people in my house like my first my honestly what i was thinking when i
[4548.66 --> 4556.02]  walked up to them and i was like did i ruin the video was this was the wrong move because i knew it
[4556.02 --> 4562.18]  was dennis a hundred percent because he was smiling oh the way that he does yeah yeah and so i was like
[4562.18 --> 4568.34]  the a move now would have been to pretend i didn't see you didn't notice them and like then start
[4568.34 --> 4575.70]  messing with them oh flip the script that would have been the aim oh my goodness that actually could
[4575.70 --> 4580.34]  have been so funny figure out what they're doing because i have access to the security cameras i could
[4580.34 --> 4584.42]  have easily tracked their movements so i could have figured out what they're doing i could have start
[4584.42 --> 4592.02]  messing started messing with their stuff which would have been amazing put like the body pillow like
[4592.02 --> 4596.26]  man the kind of stuff i could have done like i could have put like i could have put a bunch of you
[4596.26 --> 4601.62]  know those uh those anchor speakers that we did the 100 speaker oh my thing i could have put a bunch of
[4601.62 --> 4605.78]  them like stashed kind of around the bed and then just like triggered them in the middle of the night
[4605.78 --> 4611.78]  and stuff like man there was so much potential and i totally wasted it but i don't know how else you
[4611.78 --> 4618.18]  react to that though because like when when when you spotted him at first it was such a genuine like
[4618.98 --> 4630.58]  what so how do you not do that you know like that's yeah i yeah oh man oh well if ethan had hid better
[4630.58 --> 4637.62]  i might not have like caught them but ethan was just like standing there yeah that was and as soon as i saw
[4637.62 --> 4643.78]  ethan i was like channel super fun dennis it could have been anything if dennis had just played it cool
[4643.78 --> 4649.14]  and been like oh yeah did yvonne not tell you we're going we're going running today i'd have been like
[4649.14 --> 4653.86]  oh yeah no she didn't tell me why were you in the backyard okay whatever you know what forget it it's
[4653.86 --> 4659.22]  just dennis things like if if if ethan had hidden and dennis had like played it cool
[4661.06 --> 4665.38]  yeah they could have gotten away with it yeah yeah for sure and dennis could have done whatever it is
[4665.38 --> 4669.22]  that you know arts and crafts night with yvonne or whatever like they see each other outside of work
[4669.22 --> 4674.58]  um they could have done whatever dennis could have left could have snuck back into the house
[4674.58 --> 4682.58]  and i would have been none the wiser 100 one thing that this has definitely um brought to light for me
[4682.58 --> 4685.06]  is that my wife could absolutely be having an affair
[4685.06 --> 4696.90]  like my observation level you know a little low clearly clearly extremely low so you know if anyone
[4696.90 --> 4704.66]  was thinking man i'd love to make a move on that but you know linus would you know use his youtuber
[4704.66 --> 4708.58]  influence to make my life miserable or whatever clearly i'd never notice
[4708.58 --> 4720.74]  uh what else we got for merch messages here uh max asks what is the floatplane release schedule for
[4720.74 --> 4726.34]  the remaining linux challenge videos they're coming yes part two is edited i believe the plan is for it
[4726.34 --> 4732.74]  to go up this weekend oh that is the goal if i just delete these are they deleted deleted or like
[4732.74 --> 4737.70]  what is it what happens can i delete them to just manage ones that i am not going to do anything with
[4737.70 --> 4744.34]  you can they'll just be like gone though i think there's a deleted well that's fine it's a the
[4744.34 --> 4748.50]  deleted thing is a little weird yeah maybe it could just be archive and then it could just go down to
[4748.50 --> 4753.30]  the very bottom yeah because there's a deleted section so yeah archive would probably make yeah
[4753.30 --> 4758.26]  so if i could just yeah i'll just delete the ones that i've already dealt with here yeah uh mikhail says
[4758.82 --> 4763.38]  could you please make an ltt about the current state of optical media technology things like triple
[4763.38 --> 4772.02]  layer discs mdisc and so on i believe we covered mdisc at some point that may have been on ncix tech
[4772.02 --> 4780.10]  tips uh yeah you and i did an mdisc episode like 10 years ago so yeah so the current state yes uh we did
[4780.10 --> 4787.46]  do that the current state of optical media appears to be not that different from nine years ago um so i guess
[4787.46 --> 4792.82]  this no update is needed look at this guy look at look at his hair it's ridiculous he looks like an
[4792.82 --> 4797.86]  idiot why is the tv behind him instead of screen capture look at this why doesn't he care about
[4797.86 --> 4808.26]  his appearance it's awful it's awesome there's a bunch of glare on the tv whatever premium as if it would
[4808.26 --> 4813.62]  have looked any better if you shot it wait you did shoot i did shoot it yeah okay so there you go i was
[4813.62 --> 4820.34]  probably asleep probably he used to legitimately fall asleep in the chair um minz has got some
[4820.34 --> 4829.22]  chicken nuggies very nice um all right hey thanks michael m love it and uh merry christmas alex is the

[4883.78 --> 4891.54]  you can expect to get a little bit more airflow on the top um they right now are extremely close in
[4891.54 --> 4897.22]  terms of the density of the weave that i wanted like in terms of durability um i still need to
[4897.22 --> 4902.10]  wash this pair to find out if we've solved the pilling problem and i would still like to see if
[4902.10 --> 4909.86]  we can reduce the slipperiness of the sock i like a little bit more grip but overall um this is my first
[4909.86 --> 4919.06]  day with this demo pair i am pretty darn happy um and if you guys want i can uh i can go get some pants
[4919.06 --> 4925.22]  right now so why don't you do a couple more merch messages and then i'll be uh i'll be right back
[4925.94 --> 4933.62]  yeah good all right um ajg says when's female clothing coming to ltt store as far as my understanding
[4933.62 --> 4940.34]  goes they are working on it in addition to other kind of more like sizing options things like like
[4940.34 --> 4947.06]  tall wide etc um but but it takes time it's difficult to do that kind of stuff uh allocation
[4947.06 --> 4953.78]  right now is difficult etc etc etc um but yeah it's it it is a it is something that they want to do
[4953.78 --> 4957.70]  also female underwear as well as far as my understanding goes that is also included in
[4957.70 --> 4962.90]  the previous statement that i said but i could be wrong maybe hit up nick on twitter um and then
[4962.90 --> 4970.42]  says also sup other aj watching on flowplane nice heck yeah brandon r says thanks for being
[4970.98 --> 4977.54]  half my closet and keeping my love of tech alive going to school uh for networking now keep up the
[4977.54 --> 4984.50]  great work go flowplane heck yes thank you very much bought a bunch of bananas anonymous said just got
[4984.50 --> 4991.06]  hdmi 2.1 2x2 switch and was wondering if that cable tester you have can test anything with hdmi
[4991.06 --> 5001.46]  switters splitters switches and capture cards no idea sorry uh christopher h thoughts on what is this
[5003.78 --> 5014.42]  tltr lab open source ltt licensed community contributions yeah i doubt it um maybe there's
[5014.42 --> 5021.22]  certain ways that we can like validate that stuff we can maybe look into that um i'll maybe check that
[5021.22 --> 5029.06]  thread out later but there's a lot of potential issues there that's a that's quite the minefield so
[5029.06 --> 5036.42]  yeah ps luke hope that 5950x is still slinging bits after the pair it absolutely is so heck yeah
[5036.42 --> 5048.58]  cool nice i like the zipper pockets too we wanted to uh oh i guess you guys probably won't be able
[5048.58 --> 5054.98]  to hear me very well i'm just gonna change real quick oh okay oh uh is this allowed on twitch i don't
[5054.98 --> 5060.02]  think so okay well but if you're legitimately behind the chair i'm behind the chair yeah he's behind the
[5060.02 --> 5073.94]  chair it's fine it's okay all right there we go wan joggers ladies and gentlemen that matches the hoodie
[5074.66 --> 5079.86]  pretty well of course it does it's made out of exactly the same material oh they're wan joggers
[5081.30 --> 5088.18]  oh my goodness yeah because they have the logo on the other pocket too yeah so there's the it's like a
[5088.18 --> 5094.58]  stealth logo yeah wow that's super cool extra pockets on the inside dude once you have those
[5094.58 --> 5102.50]  and socks when that's cool um i don't have to own any other clothes yeah another zipper pocket on the
[5102.50 --> 5109.14]  back just in case condom pocket that's actually our internal name for all pockets that have no obvious
[5109.14 --> 5116.82]  purpose with the joke being that like our audience definitely needs lots of condoms
[5116.82 --> 5125.54]  um when they buy this merch they do oh nice yeah um so i've got the orange drawstrings
[5126.58 --> 5138.18]  um another zipper pocket uh kind of like cool uh just like accents yeah yeah like that um yeah
[5138.90 --> 5144.02]  i think the fit's awesome obviously sorry i know you guys can't really hear me very well but
[5144.02 --> 5152.50]  i'm back now it looks good so that's them land joggers are on a ship and they're coming um man we've
[5152.50 --> 5157.30]  got there's so much stuff coming we've got some nice like stretchy shorts oh so those are those are
[5157.30 --> 5162.18]  done and they're just on the way yeah i pulled this out of the size right sweet this is final final
[5162.18 --> 5171.06]  spec awesome yeah i'm extremely excited these are i mean the only the only problem is that they are
[5171.06 --> 5177.46]  we just won't have enough of them um conrad asks aren't those just american apparel sweatpants
[5177.46 --> 5183.78]  absolutely not these are our own custom they are using exactly the same material as the wan hoodie
[5183.78 --> 5189.54]  uh someone asked if the zippers are ykk if they're not my merch team is fired because i told them we only
[5189.54 --> 5195.22]  use ykk zippers actually i think some of the little hidden ones might not be so the only time we don't
[5195.22 --> 5205.06]  use ykk is when um there is for whatever reason not a ykk one available uh yeah it is on the sample
[5205.06 --> 5210.26]  sometimes we don't have ykk zippers on our samples because they're just a fit sample but when it comes
[5210.26 --> 5219.30]  to uh actual merch that we ship i'm just like it's one of the few blind brand loyalties that i have
[5219.30 --> 5224.74]  is that whenever a factory tries to sell us on anything other than a ykk zipper i'm just like
[5225.54 --> 5232.18]  no no thanks and it's a big problem because they've had supply issues like everyone and costs have
[5232.18 --> 5239.14]  gone on zippers which really sucks because it's not just we we talk about it as a silicon shortage or
[5239.14 --> 5245.94]  whatever but it's it's like materials like kind of almost in general captain observant asks why is
[5245.94 --> 5250.34]  the zipper backwards on the stealth hoodie because most people wouldn't notice but you're captain
[5250.34 --> 5256.58]  observant uh it's we just didn't think about it to be perfectly honest with you the zippers backwards
[5257.22 --> 5263.46]  uh it's it's on the opposite side usually it's like one side for female clothes or one side for male
[5263.46 --> 5267.78]  but it's different rules in commonwealth countries and the us i don't know bridget explained it to me
[5267.78 --> 5272.90]  once and i glazed over i was just like whatever i don't care for me i don't have a muscle memory for
[5272.90 --> 5278.90]  that i just figure it out and zip up my jacket like i don't yeah i don't i i it doesn't cost me a lot
[5278.90 --> 5284.90]  of extra brain cycles so yeah yeah uh anyway so hopefully that answers your question it's coming
[5284.90 --> 5289.94]  it's coming uh i heard you answer a few more are you deleting the ones that you're done with or
[5289.94 --> 5296.02]  uh no i'm getting a little lost in how this organization is okay so the curated ones i moved
[5296.02 --> 5300.50]  them ones down there that were not ones that i wanted to show up there but were ones that i wanted to
[5300.50 --> 5304.66]  acknowledge okay then everything in incoming is done okay i'll delete them up you can keep going
[5304.66 --> 5310.82]  perfect all right uh julian says love your videos hey thanks julian have you guys considered making
[5310.82 --> 5314.82]  a video comparing different search engines for example i use duckduckgo not for its privacy but
[5314.82 --> 5320.66]  for the convenience of bang search no i have not considered making a video about uh comparing
[5320.66 --> 5331.38]  different search engines um yes no i have not um i don't know that we would do that i think that's
[5331.38 --> 5337.78]  probably that's probably gonna be a tough sell i don't i don't think that would perform particularly
[5337.78 --> 5345.94]  well um paul says undies hi i'm paul i don't know why i moved that into curated oh probably because i
[5345.94 --> 5349.78]  just missed the notification because conrad didn't give me enough time speaking of which
[5349.78 --> 5356.42]  we have an update on the conrad challenge uh conrad says i can pick any game give him two weeks to learn
[5356.42 --> 5363.06]  it and he will beat me conrad i'm sorry to do this to you but i really just i'm kind of feeling hungry
[5363.06 --> 5368.58]  and i really want someone to buy me lunch so i choose beat saber i'd give you two months to play beat
[5368.58 --> 5372.98]  saber but i've been known to i don't think you should have any training time i've been known to make
[5372.98 --> 5378.18]  concessions i think he should just play you like right away he said any game boom no there was no
[5378.18 --> 5383.78]  i'm fine with two weeks i don't think david david still owes me uh still owes me a and i beat you at
[5383.78 --> 5388.34]  beat saber uh uh challenge he says the end of the month by the way for the people who keep up asking
[5388.34 --> 5395.54]  about that all right so conrad uh you've got two weeks to get better than me at beat saber good luck
[5395.54 --> 5400.74]  okay epic good i could have gone a couple different directions but yeah i could have gone with forged
[5400.74 --> 5404.98]  alliance that's that's a game that is not easy to pick up in two weeks even if you're a very
[5404.98 --> 5411.22]  experienced gamer um like luke is a better gamer than me pretty much any genre like we sit down and
[5411.22 --> 5416.58]  play a conventional uh rts like starcraft or something like that and he will absolutely destroy
[5416.58 --> 5424.34]  me not forged alliance is just it hits a little different not even close um it's like a full-time
[5424.34 --> 5430.58]  job keeping up with the meta even though it's like a 12 year old game or whatever okay what else we got
[5430.58 --> 5437.22]  here in the merch messages uh any plans for heavier winter wear asks eric w yes we do so remember if
[5437.22 --> 5444.66]  you are subscribed to the ltt store um newsletter you'll have seen that we did a post about this
[5444.66 --> 5454.98]  like 3d printed down style like material um we have a jacket that would be meant to kind of go on top of a
[5454.98 --> 5460.26]  hoodie like it's not a super insulated one but it's like a layering up kind of shell uh waterproof
[5460.82 --> 5465.86]  uh we're working on that we also have a windbreaker that's even lighter than that it's just a pure shell
[5466.42 --> 5471.78]  we're working on that um i don't know if either of those is going to make it for this winter but the
[5471.78 --> 5477.14]  thing about ltt store is that we're not really constrained in the same way that a lot of more
[5477.14 --> 5484.42]  traditional clothing businesses are if we if we miss a season we're like f it launch it anyway
[5484.42 --> 5493.22]  sucks oh well yeah people in australia can buy it you know what do what do we care i mean we care
[5493.22 --> 5501.62]  obviously it'd be nice to you know we have literally millions of dollars deployed right now in merch that
[5501.62 --> 5506.90]  we have purchased but have not received and cannot sell and therefore cannot make back our investment
[5506.90 --> 5513.06]  on uh obviously we definitely want to sell stuff yeah but it's not like we're under the same kind
[5513.06 --> 5521.06]  of pressure where if we if we miss it by a month you know now it's on fire sale and we're selling it at
[5521.06 --> 5526.26]  a loss following whatever various current fashion trends whatever and we literally can't reuse it next
[5526.26 --> 5531.38]  year like it's not like that so it makes life a little bit easier for us but
[5531.38 --> 5538.42]  that uh man i really like that uh that that shell jacket with the the printed down type material
[5538.42 --> 5544.10]  inside it it's super warm it's super comfy it's got like a really nice hand feel to it i really like
[5544.10 --> 5550.26]  it uh that that's a garment where sometimes you start with what your goal is in terms of the finished
[5550.26 --> 5557.06]  product so with wan hoodie v2 we started with the goal of making wan hoodie but like better um and then
[5557.06 --> 5561.70]  we went and we found we sourced materials and we sourced construction methods like we figured it
[5561.70 --> 5567.94]  out um with the jacket we found a material we really liked and we were like let's make a garment now
[5569.06 --> 5573.78]  it can kind of go both ways i was asking bridget about it and apparently that's actually more common
[5573.78 --> 5580.26]  than you might think to find a really cool material and then be like okay we have to do something what can
[5580.26 --> 5590.02]  we do with this what is its best application yeah um thoughts between valve index or htc vive money is
[5590.02 --> 5596.50]  not an issue well if money is not an issue i mean the index is obviously the way to go jose but i also
[5596.50 --> 5603.86]  just got a review unit of the pimax 8k or pix max or whatever they're called i think pimax and uh also
[5603.86 --> 5609.38]  their 5k one which i believe supports an even higher refresh rate than the index so i'm gonna have a video
[5609.38 --> 5614.18]  coming on those once i get a chance to really try and daily drive them also like is he talking about the
[5615.06 --> 5621.06]  the vive flow or i'm not sure which it almost doesn't matter because if you're going for the highest
[5621.06 --> 5626.58]  possible performance the index is is better it's it's there uh christian asks what's your favorite color
[5627.54 --> 5631.62]  i feel like i've answered this question on wan show before i'm not six i don't have a favorite color
[5632.74 --> 5639.14]  um do you have a favorite color not really okay i used to like answer that with
[5639.14 --> 5644.34]  red but now at this point it's like well no not really i don't know so i don't know
[5644.90 --> 5649.14]  um it's just kind of yeah good album good album re-released recently oh um
[5651.70 --> 5656.98]  uh this is a cool suggestion from anonymous i think it was last wan show someone asked about
[5656.98 --> 5662.74]  fashionable anti-static wrist straps but i was wondering if it would be possible to make an anti-static
[5662.74 --> 5670.02]  watch strap so you just get a watch strap that's like just a broadly compatible watch strap then you
[5670.02 --> 5674.42]  just have like an anti-static do hickey on there and then you can just clip on and clip off and you
[5674.42 --> 5681.38]  never have to take on put on and take off your strap ever again standard g-shock with a little yeah
[5681.38 --> 5689.30]  would be awesome that's actually a brilliant idea yeah that'd be sweet um i i like it i'm gonna email
[5689.30 --> 5693.78]  it to nick nice do you want to do another one while i do that sure
[5696.66 --> 5704.18]  this is from anonymous very qualified for ltd lab position has put has published four academic papers
[5704.18 --> 5710.66]  and one patent damn daniel but can't start for at least six months phd thesis defense and don't have
[5710.66 --> 5715.22]  canadian work visa that's a bit of an issue that's tough but if you have those kinds of credentials
[5715.22 --> 5719.38]  it's a lot easier to get you in here which is one of the reasons that i didn't bring that up to the
[5719.38 --> 5726.18]  same degree as i have in the past in the hiring video so you have to have like mean credentials like
[5726.18 --> 5733.70]  that though um he says should i bother applying absolutely i would yeah yep luke what led you to using
[5733.70 --> 5740.58]  oh that jumped around oh goodness um angular over react view or others uh love the
[5740.58 --> 5746.34]  channel and love what ltd is doing for tech um my developers were like hey we want to use this
[5746.34 --> 5747.94]  and i was like sweet
[5751.78 --> 5755.62]  okay yeah i know there was it was a good management loop it was a conversation over
[5756.42 --> 5763.46]  a decently extended period of time but um two of the main developers that do most of the work that would
[5763.46 --> 5771.54]  be that part of the project wanted to use angular so i'm sorry i'm not going to butcher your name um so
[5771.54 --> 5777.38]  i i'm going to go with iv your initials um hey from brazil any chance of an ios job position opening
[5778.02 --> 5784.98]  um we have one dev that actually does both android and ios for us and he is that's probably the word that
[5784.98 --> 5792.50]  i would use so we don't need another one right now because he is too overpowered yeah pretty much yeah you
[5792.50 --> 5797.86]  heard it here first but uh there's probably going to be a raise in his future when we talk about that
[5797.86 --> 5803.38]  pretty soon heck yeah yeah i think that guy's name was isaac um oh is that i think it's just
[5803.38 --> 5808.18]  i think it's just an interesting spell oh like a more like south american kind of spelling yeah got it
[5809.22 --> 5814.90]  uh joe says i started watching your videos back in 2014 they helped me much in my oh we don't
[5814.90 --> 5820.58]  also we don't only use angular just to be clear sorry um building my first pc i started mining this year
[5820.58 --> 5825.94]  you helped me get ahead so time to pay it back a little um mining not exactly a popular popular
[5825.94 --> 5831.14]  thing with the pc community at the moment although can i can i kind of go off script a little bit here
[5832.34 --> 5838.82]  i think there's a lot of closet miners in the gaming community yeah like i think there's a lot of hate
[5839.70 --> 5844.18]  but i think there's a lot of closet when there's when there's so much hate around a subject like that
[5844.18 --> 5848.26]  a huge amount of the population that is receiving the hate is just going to not talk about it
[5848.26 --> 5856.10]  so you don't know they're there yeah 100 yeah i think that's uh i think that's a bit of a thing
[5856.10 --> 5863.78]  so there's that uh hey thanks joe uh anonymous you should make more all black stuff really nice for
[5863.78 --> 5868.18]  work also an all black desk pad would be cool we have an all black desk pad coming it's going to have
[5868.18 --> 5872.90]  like a circuit design kind of like the wall in the lounge but it's going to be black on black so like
[5872.90 --> 5879.38]  stealth circuit desk pad we've actually had a lot of feedback that um people in in different like
[5879.38 --> 5885.30]  working situations are able to wear the all black stuff um like last show when i was just doing these
[5885.30 --> 5889.46]  we had feedback from multiple different people that they worked in environments where they were not
[5889.46 --> 5893.38]  allowed to wear things with branding and logos but they were able to get away with the stealth
[5894.42 --> 5898.66]  which i found pretty interesting people in in like filming departments that can't wear anything other
[5898.66 --> 5903.06]  than all black stuff uh there was another one that i i don't remember the context but he could only
[5903.06 --> 5909.86]  wear all black stuff uh yeah it was kind of cool yeah i mean honestly the where that came from was
[5909.86 --> 5917.22]  wanting the product to be good enough that people would want to buy it even if it wasn't merch yeah
[5917.22 --> 5921.46]  that's the idea that's where the whole stealth name came from like repping a brand without
[5922.34 --> 5928.50]  without wanting everyone around you to be like linus who's linus you know that kind of thing or
[5928.66 --> 5934.34]  without um yeah without having to defend it for one thing and then the other part is because i feel
[5934.34 --> 5940.42]  like it puts more pressure on us to do better than just well we took this cafe press thing and we
[5940.42 --> 5946.58]  silkscreened our logo onto it um we didn't always have the time and resources to do that but it's
[5946.58 --> 5953.06]  definitely something that we're trying to do now uh pratush says love the show given apple's repair
[5953.06 --> 5957.38]  programs how do you see right to repair factor in with integrated socs considering their performance and
[5957.38 --> 5968.02]  efficiency improvements so you're never going to be able to repair an soc like yourself um but that
[5968.02 --> 5975.62]  doesn't mean that right to repair can't still make devices with socs more repairable so you know whether
[5975.62 --> 5983.46]  it's um it depends it's making schematics available so that you could swap the soc or whether it's um whether
[5983.46 --> 5990.26]  it's at least not going out of your way to put encryption keys on the soc where there's no way
[5990.26 --> 5996.34]  to that where all your data is gone immediately when you lose access to it there's no way to even
[5996.34 --> 6003.78]  enter the the shared uh or not the shared whatever the there's there's no way to decrypt it even if you
[6003.78 --> 6009.06]  knew the password right if the if all the encryption data is stored on the soc even though the storage is
[6009.06 --> 6014.90]  somewhere else like there's ways that you can make a device more repair friendly even if it's tightly
[6014.90 --> 6021.06]  integrated which does have clear performance benefits so it's just an attitude problem at the
[6021.06 --> 6029.70]  end of the day uh cody says i play warhammer vermin verminatide 2 vermintide vermintide oh is it just
[6029.70 --> 6036.66]  spelled wrong maybe but it's vermintide is that a new game no but it allows you to select the number of cpu
[6036.66 --> 6041.22]  threads the game can use would you consider trying that game for cpu performance tests probably not
[6041.86 --> 6049.62]  when we are looking at games that um can stress a cpu it's not necessarily that we're looking for that
[6049.62 --> 6054.10]  i mean if we wanted to restrict how many threads it was using we could do that um manually we could
[6054.10 --> 6060.26]  either disable cores on the bios we could um i think i don't know how well it works but you could
[6060.26 --> 6067.30]  pin the process to certain cores using windows um and really what we're looking for is games that are
[6067.30 --> 6073.06]  not very graphically demanding so that they're just a so that the cpu becomes the bottleneck
[6073.62 --> 6079.62]  uh that's that's really what we're looking for uh there's the organic chemist one wait oh no the
[6079.62 --> 6087.70]  organic chemist one was a different one oh boy i deleted it now it's gone i feel terrible uh the point is
[6087.70 --> 6094.66]  deleted section i don't think we do have an organic chemist position no but then there was a there was
[6094.66 --> 6102.58]  a wife and the wife had credentials uh control f chemist uh no it's gone oh shoot okay i'm sorry
[6102.58 --> 6108.90]  uh i feel bad but there is really nothing that i can do about it now uh ehor says have you considered
[6108.90 --> 6113.54]  constraining the width of ltt store to some centered container that doesn't span across the whole width of
[6113.54 --> 6122.74]  your screen they include in that comment it looks a little weird on ultra wides and they are correct
[6122.74 --> 6127.46]  it does look a little weird on ultra wides um because it it spans really wide but if you're
[6127.46 --> 6131.62]  looking at me like you're waiting for me to answer this question no i'm giving you feedback because i
[6131.62 --> 6136.34]  don't i don't know if you've tried it or not but it spans really wide but i believe it only shows
[6136.34 --> 6142.74]  four products wide or something um so it is pretty funky uh and we are looking into doing more that one of
[6142.74 --> 6146.58]  the things that's holding us back a little bit from doing a lot of theming changes to the store
[6146.58 --> 6153.22]  right now is that there's this new hydrogen thing coming out um it hit more of an open beta recently
[6153.22 --> 6160.10]  but we were in more of like a closed beta program with it um and we want to use that but that is going
[6160.10 --> 6166.98]  to involve like a whole redo to the store so i don't necessarily want to do a ton of little stuff
[6166.98 --> 6173.78]  like that right now um because i'd rather put that work into the whole remake of the store
[6174.82 --> 6181.78]  got it but yes i hear you and it's it's not great henry could you consider a supplement to the linux
[6181.78 --> 6185.30]  challenge maybe episode seven where anthony or someone goes over what to look for in a linux
[6185.30 --> 6189.62]  distro for gaming and some that are particularly good for game compatibility for a new user i think
[6189.62 --> 6195.06]  what we already learned through the linux challenge is that linux people are not going to have
[6195.62 --> 6201.14]  that much difficulty in any distro obviously some will be easier than others and non-linux people
[6201.70 --> 6208.10]  it is a barrier that is not reasonably overcomable if your only goal is to play games if your goal is
[6208.10 --> 6213.46]  to play games and to learn linux as a hobby that's a completely separate question in which case go do
[6213.46 --> 6217.46]  your research on that or go distro hop because that's that's sort of the whole point because that's
[6217.46 --> 6225.46]  what you're doing yeah right yeah um joshua uh vmware workstation pro 16 added support for direct
[6225.46 --> 6229.94]  x11 and opengl 4.1 for virtual machines and games it would be interesting to see a deep dive into what
[6229.94 --> 6240.66]  can be done with this feature um yeah maybe maybe we haven't tooled around with vmware too much
[6242.18 --> 6245.94]  and it seems like there'd be a bit of a learning curve for us to figure out what to do with something like
[6245.94 --> 6251.30]  that but it's definitely cool zachary says my father-in-law is the director of an amazing
[6251.30 --> 6256.02]  international non-profit called curious learning that's uh apps and content to increase literacy
[6256.02 --> 6260.10]  in developing countries would it be worth suggesting they reach out for a potential collab we don't do a
[6260.10 --> 6268.34]  ton of collabs just for the sake of collab and we tend to try to keep things pretty on topic and by on
[6268.34 --> 6275.30]  topic i mean like hardware on topic software is not really something that we've got a lot of audience
[6275.30 --> 6279.94]  overlap with believe it or not yeah there's certain categories that you would think um intuitively
[6279.94 --> 6286.18]  would perform really well for us but i was actually having a conversation with um our tech wiki writer
[6286.18 --> 6292.50]  john about how you know gaming topics are not performing particularly well on that channel and
[6292.50 --> 6296.26]  he's like what are they just not gamers and it's like well it's not that they're not gamers it's just
[6296.26 --> 6303.38]  that that might not be what they consume on youtube right yeah um michael asks thoughts on some
[6303.38 --> 6310.02]  chip manufacturing we move to the us and how slash when it will affect this shortage slash the market
[6310.02 --> 6316.02]  well not for a few years but yes it should help but it also won't affect certain things um like for
[6316.02 --> 6319.78]  example one of the issues with the automotive industry is they're still just using a bunch of
[6319.78 --> 6324.82]  outdated crap that nobody wants to build more fab capacity for so if they don't change that then it's
[6324.82 --> 6329.22]  not going to help and and this is part of your question but fab capacity takes a long time to bring
[6329.22 --> 6334.66]  online uh and even when it is online as far as my understanding goes it takes a bit to get it
[6335.22 --> 6341.94]  efficient as well uh chris e uh yes more wan themed products like the pants that i'm wearing right now
[6341.94 --> 6346.82]  uh would love to get your thoughts on diy perks custom ps5 chassis i haven't actually seen it
[6346.82 --> 6354.50]  uh sounds cool everything diy perks does is amazing yeah chris b uh this topic reminded me that i could
[6354.50 --> 6357.78]  use new water bottles so i went with the stormtrooper look one in hopes it won't hit anything and will
[6357.78 --> 6363.30]  stay dent free for longer that's very funny very funny chris get it it won't hit anything we've
[6363.30 --> 6369.30]  actually had that joke a couple times have we already all right well that's a shame uh my or mal
[6369.30 --> 6375.06]  asks any word on the new kids book i haven't started it yet i'm sorry you are making one though
[6375.06 --> 6378.26]  uh though i want to do a counting book i want to do a colors book shapes book i just
[6381.38 --> 6386.90]  also is ltx 2022 happening so far that is the tentative plan we're gonna try we're gonna give it a shot
[6387.78 --> 6392.66]  uh hunter been watching since the langley house love the way your channel's going would you say
[6392.66 --> 6397.06]  secret lab chairs are comfy so they sponsored this show full disclosure like they were a sponsor of the
[6397.06 --> 6404.10]  wan show but uh before secret lab had sponsored us um we talked about them in alex's intel extreme
[6404.10 --> 6409.94]  tech upgrade and as far as i can tell they're using exactly the same materials as maxnomic who i've been
[6410.50 --> 6415.78]  an advocate for through sponsorship and not sponsorship for many years now i think they're good quality
[6415.78 --> 6421.30]  chairs uh they don't have a lot of the same issues as the other gaming chairs they are still they have
[6421.30 --> 6427.06]  that look right but uh the material quality is significantly better than a lot of the really
[6427.06 --> 6436.02]  bad gaming shares out there yeah um final two last two eduardo oh wait this is more asking about ltt
[6436.02 --> 6442.02]  socks carity answered that sup eduardo and matthew can floatplane get merch discount codes like the youtube
[6442.02 --> 6447.06]  join channel uh yes i don't see why not but i don't know if we have a mechanism for it yet uh we we can
[6447.70 --> 6453.06]  we can get it working though okay do you wanna like throw that in the dock or whatever it's there
[6453.06 --> 6470.02]  and do you wanna throw this show to being over yeah thanks for watching bye
[6472.02 --> 6492.82]  anthony says short answer re good distro for gaming there isn't a best distro for gaming distros are
[6492.82 --> 6497.62]  little more than package management and defaults yeah that's fair there are some that are set up to
[6497.62 --> 6501.62]  get going more easily but as we've seen easy isn't necessarily universal depending on package
[6501.62 --> 6507.46]  stability and hardware configuration also the the easiness in my opinion is almost nothing like
[6508.10 --> 6515.06]  you pre-install the graphics driver which takes literally seconds in a lot of operating systems
[6515.06 --> 6521.86]  and in some distros distros sorry uh and and like in in the case of mint it was this big pop-up in the
[6521.86 --> 6527.14]  corner that was like do you want to do the thing and i was like yup and it was like cool i did it for you
[6527.14 --> 6534.90]  and that was the only gap cool like it's not the hard part um pick the distro that has the most
[6534.90 --> 6541.30]  comfortable defaults and go from there linux challenge part seven is now over fair enough anthony
[6541.30 --> 6555.14]  mic drop mic drop anthony all right and we're done
