And again I find myself talking to Linus about his completely arrogant mindset.  Timestamp: 1:23:35                    The reason that colleges do not pay their athletes is the fact the colleges pay for other things for them like NICE food and NICE housing. Plus sometimes healthcare, dental care, and clothing. Plus it is for the experience too. A lot of these athletes did not even pay for college and went on a scholarship. These people are getting all this stuff for being able to throw a ball or kick it a certain way. Not any actual work.

Once again Linus Sebastion is not using his very limited brain cells. Timestamp: 1:01:00.   The free market will regulate itself and if enough people refuse to buy AirPods for long enough because of this problem then Apple will have to change it to stop losing money.  You are looking at the short term. In the long term, the free market is always controlled by the consumers. That is the best thing about the Free Market System.  I hope you have enough brain cells to realize that a Communistic Command economy is not good. A command economy is where the Government controls everything and forces all products to be built a certain way, what products will be made, and how they will be sold.

I'm sorry everyone. No timestamps for now. Battling youtube for 3 hours is really upsetting

Dude you should sell random used stuff from your vids on only fans. People would definitely buy a used rag or used box for sure . I would not buy it but people 100 percent would just to have something used by you just to show off you could even have a certificate with the video and timestamp. Nevermind actually I would but something I don't know what. You should definitely cash in on this. You have cashed in on everything else you can lol. Why not squeeze every bit you can and make money from your trash?
