[0.00 --> 8.64]  What is up y'all? Welcome to the WAN show. Come one, come all, enjoy the best technology show
[8.64 --> 14.42]  that's live on the internet right now, hosted by me and Luke. Yes, that's very specific,
[14.60 --> 19.74]  but I didn't want to risk offending anyone for all I know. You know, Wendell or Jay's Two Cents
[19.74 --> 23.56]  or someone like that could be streaming at the same time, and I don't want them to feel like
[23.56 --> 28.98]  I think that Luke and Linus are better or whatever the case may be. We've got a lot of great topics
[28.98 --> 37.16]  for you guys today, including Intel's newest lake, that is their newest processor, detailed for the
[37.16 --> 41.84]  first time. And actually, you know what, that's not going to be a main topic because it's not nearly
[41.84 --> 49.68]  as interesting as Intel Arc. And of course, no, I do not mean Intel Arc, the product specifications
[49.68 --> 56.92]  database where you can look up, you know, how many gigahertz things have generation by generation.
[56.92 --> 63.44]  That's boring stuff. I'm talking Intel Arc graphics. That's right. We've got a bunch of new information
[63.44 --> 72.30]  for you. Also, OnlyFans hurts itself in its confusion by banning sexually explicit content starting in
[72.30 --> 78.52]  October. How did this happen? We're going to dig into it. And we're going to talk about some potential
[78.52 --> 86.24]  solutions for users and creators who are going to miss that. Well, OnlyFans being what it like actually
[86.24 --> 93.30]  is. What else we got today? You stole one of mine, but Halo Infinite won't ship with co-op,
[93.50 --> 101.46]  massive disappointment, or Forge, large but not quite as large disappointment. Absolutely ridiculous.
[101.68 --> 109.78]  That's actually like not stoked on the non-co-op, not going to lie. I feel like I am constantly,
[109.78 --> 116.26]  constantly searching for co-op games. And Halo has, except for I think once, been very consistent
[116.26 --> 125.30]  about having co-op and then just nope. Also, there's a Gigabyte response, but I don't know how long that's
[125.30 --> 129.10]  going to take. I don't think that's... It's pretty funny, actually. Gigabyte responded... Is it much different
[129.10 --> 132.78]  than their previous response? Because they've already responded once. I don't think so.
[132.78 --> 138.10]  Yeah. But it's just funny because they did it again. We'll talk about it again. All right.
[138.90 --> 140.78]  Let's roll that intro. Yeah.
[140.78 --> 141.10]  Yeah.
[141.10 --> 163.38]  All of Flowplane chat is already talking about OnlyFans. Well, yeah, obviously. It's like insane.
[163.38 --> 173.28]  The show is brought to you today by BuildRedux.com, Elgato featuring their face cam, and C-Sonic.
[173.76 --> 179.12]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I think you guys want us to talk about the OnlyFans situation. So
[179.12 --> 185.86]  why don't we jump right into that in a massive shock? Okay. You know what? Hold on a second. Before
[185.86 --> 193.36]  we talk about it, I am going to go to OnlyFans.com. Okay. I'm going to OnlyFans.com. I'm not going
[193.36 --> 199.40]  to share my screen because I don't want to end up, you know, getting my...
[199.40 --> 200.16]  I'm going to Twitch.
[200.74 --> 206.28]  Okay. Hold on a second. There's an SMS code. We do have an account, as you guys may or may
[206.28 --> 213.50]  not know. We had our own OnlyFans for a short period of time. I'm going to go see if it was
[213.50 --> 219.22]  sent to the number. That is a number that I can access. Is this a new one? Okay. Yeah.
[219.22 --> 227.62]  I think I got it. Okay. Verify code. Okay. Now, OnlyFans... Oh, wrong code. Oh, shoot. It
[227.62 --> 233.70]  didn't... Ugh. Since when does copy-paste not work out of TeamViewer? TeamViewer called at
[233.70 --> 240.56]  7 this morning. 7 o'clock in the morning this morning. And what did they want to know, Vaughn?
[240.56 --> 248.28]  They wanted to know why we don't subscribe to their subscription. It was at 7.30 in the
[248.28 --> 255.44]  morning. They wanted to know if we're still using their service. And... Hold on. They
[255.44 --> 258.56]  wanted to know if we're still using their service and if we want their subscription-based...
[258.56 --> 262.62]  Their subscription-based service instead of the one-time one that we bought.
[263.56 --> 264.88]  No. I want a one-time one.
[264.88 --> 270.76]  My answer to them was... Well, I didn't answer them because my wife picked up the phone. But
[270.76 --> 277.34]  my answer would have been... F*** off because I've told you guys not to f***ing contact me
[277.34 --> 282.32]  about this. If I wanted a subscription-based TeamViewer, I would buy a subscription-based
[282.32 --> 287.38]  TeamViewer. I bought the one-time TeamViewer because that's what I think TeamViewer is worth.
[287.38 --> 294.86]  A one-time... A one-time fee. I paid them like 7 grand or something like that for...
[294.86 --> 298.48]  the number of seats that we have. It's perfect. It's exactly what we need. And I never want
[298.48 --> 301.32]  anything else. Stop talking to me.
[301.32 --> 305.66]  We never got the fur in a conversation today, but they called me previously.
[306.08 --> 306.40]  Yeah.
[306.40 --> 308.74]  What are you looking up? What are you looking up on OnlyFans?
[308.74 --> 313.14]  I'm trying to... I'm actually kind of trying to figure out like how only... Okay. So...
[313.14 --> 320.66]  Oh, right. Right. Right. So OnlyFans' theory, I guess, is that they are not strictly a pornographic
[320.66 --> 324.28]  website, right? Because when OnlyFans... Very theory.
[324.28 --> 333.50]  When OnlyFans was founded by, if I recall correctly, like an adult content mogul, when OnlyFans was
[333.50 --> 340.60]  founded, it was not necessarily targeting just adult content. But what I'm trying to figure out right
[340.60 --> 345.40]  now is how to even navigate this website. Okay. I am screen sharing now. If I go to home,
[345.40 --> 354.94]  it's just... Is it just my home? I don't, honestly speaking, know how to use this website.
[356.14 --> 358.80]  What are you trying to find? Anyways, what are you going...
[358.80 --> 364.84]  I'm trying to demonstrate that OnlyFans is going to be fine without sexually explicit content,
[364.96 --> 365.90]  Luke. Oh.
[365.90 --> 372.16]  I want to try to find not sexually explicit content on OnlyFans. And I can't even... Honestly
[372.16 --> 377.36]  speaking, I cannot even figure out how to use... Well, do they even have discoverability? You'd
[377.36 --> 384.34]  have to go from a content creator that is not based on sexually explicit things and get to their page
[384.34 --> 389.38]  that way, right? How would I find one of those? I mean, you'd have to, I think, find their Twitter
[389.38 --> 392.60]  or their YouTube video or whatever it is that leads you there. Okay. So...
[392.60 --> 396.04]  I don't think there's discoverability on the platform. Forget it then. Forget it. Starting
[396.04 --> 402.08]  in October then, OnlyFans will not allow creators to post material with sexually explicit content.
[402.34 --> 408.70]  Nude photos and videos that comply with OnlyFans policies are still allowed and OnlyFans will
[408.70 --> 414.60]  provide more guidance on those new policies at a later date. The company made a statement explaining
[414.60 --> 420.60]  the decision that basically said, this is a quote, effective 1st of October, 2021. So there's not
[420.60 --> 426.12]  even a ton of notice on this. That's less than two months. OnlyFans will prohibit the posting of any
[426.12 --> 433.00]  content containing sexually explicit conduct. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of
[433.00 --> 439.08]  the platform and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our
[439.08 --> 443.92]  content guidelines. Creators will continue to be allowed to post content containing nudity,
[443.92 --> 449.44]  as long as it is consistent with our acceptable use policy. These changes are to comply with the
[449.44 --> 454.06]  requests of our banking partners and payout providers. We will be sharing more details in
[454.06 --> 458.26]  the coming days and we will actively support and guide our creators through this change in content
[458.26 --> 465.38]  guidelines. Now, here's something that I am kind of wondering about. I don't see anything about this
[465.38 --> 472.10]  in our notes here. Oh no, I do. So, creators on OnlyFans have earned more than 4.5 billion
[472.10 --> 481.14]  over the past five years. Billion! They had $2 billion in sales last year, and they're on pace to
[481.14 --> 489.78]  generate more than double that this year. They keep 20% of that sales figure. That is $400 million
[489.78 --> 496.02]  in revenue. Have you ever used OnlyFans service? They could not possibly have more than a couple dozen
[496.02 --> 502.18]  developers. No offense, OnlyFans. Now, now... A lot of that money is going to go towards, well, yeah,
[502.18 --> 505.38]  not as much as you think based on a few things, but we can get into that in a moment. But a lot of
[505.38 --> 508.74]  it's going to go towards payment processors, infrastructure, stuff like that. But sorry,
[508.74 --> 513.70]  keep going. Sure. But in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform,
[514.34 --> 520.98]  if I had... You kick off all your people. If I had $400 million a year in net revenue,
[520.98 --> 530.82]  I think I'd probably figure out how to be sustainable without turning off the thing that
[530.82 --> 536.98]  makes my entire website tick. Now, there have been plenty of ads recently for non-adult content
[536.98 --> 543.14]  on OnlyFans. OFTV is an app that is a safer work alternative to the main site, free of sexually
[543.14 --> 550.90]  explicit content, and launched last week. Now, back talking about their revenue. They have
[551.14 --> 559.86]  more than 130 million users paying monthly fees. That is an utterly mind-blowing number. And many
[559.86 --> 565.14]  sex workers are claiming that this is their primary source of income and that they will be temporarily
[565.14 --> 570.50]  out of work while searching for a new platform. Anthony left a note in here, a sex worker that I've
[570.50 --> 575.94]  been in contact with since the April Fools video says they're moving to Just For Fans, which is
[575.94 --> 580.74]  specifically run as an adult site. It's significantly smaller, so it'll be a major loss in income,
[580.74 --> 585.94]  while the platform comes up to speed. But it's pretty obvious that this is not going to be a unique
[585.94 --> 592.66]  story and there's going to be a huge amount of momentum shifting away from OnlyFans and towards
[592.66 --> 601.70]  alternatives like Just For Fans. Now, with that said, can we think of any examples of sites or services
[601.70 --> 608.18]  that have managed to pivot from being predominantly sexually explicit content to something else?
[608.18 --> 616.50]  Let's say Tumblr, for example. How'd that go, Luke? Did you use Tumblr? Do you use Tumblr these days?
[616.50 --> 622.50]  I have never used either of these platforms, which doesn't help, but we have quite a bit of numbers on
[622.50 --> 628.34]  the Tumblr change. And we know that not only was Tumblr already going down, which is quite different in
[628.34 --> 635.22]  this case, because OnlyFans is rocketing, going hockey stick, as Linus likes to say. But Tumblr was
[635.22 --> 642.82]  was consistently dying when they made their change and then just incredibly accelerated that decline.
[642.82 --> 654.34]  So pretty rough. A year after the ban in 2018, site visits had dropped by nearly a minute.
[654.34 --> 660.74]  What? Average monthly login page traffic by US visitors dropped by 49%. Average daily users dropped
[660.74 --> 665.62]  by 35%. That's all for Tumblr. That's really rough. Honestly, not as much as I had expected,
[665.62 --> 670.34]  based on how people talked about what Tumblr was, but still pretty rough. And you do have to consider
[670.34 --> 677.14]  that they were already on a decline. So some of that drop was like to be expected. But that was a bit,
[677.14 --> 682.98]  quite a bit sharper than you would have expected from Tumblr. There's some interesting stuff here.
[682.98 --> 687.78]  They, OnlyFans specifically said these changes are to comply with the requests of our banking
[688.58 --> 696.66]  partners and payout providers. That's a little bit wider than my understanding. But there's a post,
[696.66 --> 701.30]  I'm going to put it in the dock. I was grabbing this right as we were getting ready and I didn't have
[701.30 --> 707.70]  time to get it in there. I will put it at the bottom of this so you can see it. There was a post
[707.70 --> 716.66]  back in April 15th of this year that MasterCard was making pretty big changes that will impact the entire
[716.66 --> 724.10]  adult entertainment industry. Yeah. And I think this is it. So the changes that are going to,
[724.10 --> 731.06]  that were going to impact tube sites that included Pornhub, X videos, and fan sites, including OnlyFans,
[731.06 --> 738.98]  Just for Fans, Fan Centro, etc. are this list. Enter, you, you, these are all requirements. You
[738.98 --> 742.90]  need to enter into a written agreement with any individual that is contributing content to the
[742.90 --> 748.26]  website. This includes the individual's consent, their identity, and age. Seems like a good idea.
[749.22 --> 752.90]  It does seem like a decent amount of paperwork, but that's probably already in place for OnlyFans.
[752.90 --> 759.46]  All persons depicted in content must give consent for the content to be distributed and downloaded.
[760.34 --> 766.90]  That I doubt was already a thing. Not impossible, but a decent amount of extra paperwork.
[767.46 --> 772.18]  Age and identity of all persons depicted is required. Again, I doubt that was already a thing,
[772.18 --> 778.18]  but probably not impossible. A lot of paperwork again. Only verified users can be permitted to upload
[778.18 --> 783.30]  content. I believe that is a thing. That's already a thing on OnlyFans. It's actually a very onerous
[783.30 --> 790.42]  process to get verified. Yeah. So I believe that is a thing. This is the big one. And I think this was
[790.42 --> 797.06]  the big problem one. A lot of these policies seem good. And honestly, in a lot of ways, so does this one.
[797.06 --> 804.58]  It just seems very difficult and extremely expensive. All content must be reviewed prior to publication,
[805.30 --> 810.34]  or real time if it's live streamed. So you'd have to have someone sitting there watching the live stream.
[810.90 --> 818.50]  And no content can violate the card brand, BRAM, business risk assessment and mitigation policies.
[818.50 --> 823.30]  I'm not 100% sure what those are. Other things include, that one's the big one. Other things
[823.30 --> 828.90]  include website must have a compliant process for reporting review and removal of violating content,
[828.90 --> 833.14]  must have policies in place to make sure that the website cannot be used for human trafficking. Seems
[833.14 --> 842.18]  like a good idea. Provide monthly reports to the acquirer of flagged content and what was taken down. And no
[842.18 --> 847.06]  search terms or marketing partners can give the illusion that the content they are marketing will
[847.06 --> 850.74]  contain child exploitation materials or depictions of non consensual activity.
[852.10 --> 861.70]  A lot of those seem good. Just like things that maybe not all of them does only fans do. And the
[861.70 --> 868.10]  all content reviewed prior to publication or real time if it's live streamed thing sounds very expensive to
[868.10 --> 873.62]  do. And especially when your take is 20% and you have payment processor fees on top of that and
[873.62 --> 880.34]  infrastructure fees and all and on and on and on and on and on. So yeah, it doesn't sound impossible.
[881.46 --> 887.46]  But it's not like MasterCard said, you can't do this anymore. They just put a really big wall in the
[887.46 --> 887.70]  way.
[887.70 --> 893.78]  And what's problematic is BRAM or BRAM. I'm not sure how they how they pronounce that. Here's
[893.78 --> 899.30]  MasterCard's own this is an unlisted video, I think. Or maybe it's not unlisted. I don't know,
[899.30 --> 904.98]  whatever it's here. So here's the video that MasterCard put up and what it is is business risk
[904.98 --> 911.38]  assessment and mitigation. So this is about preserving the strength and value of the MasterCard brand.
[911.38 --> 917.54]  Basically, what they're saying is that you are now liable for making sure that any payment that
[917.54 --> 924.02]  you process using MasterCard and you can't control what credit card your user is going to use to an
[924.02 --> 931.46]  extent. Any payment is going to be for something that it will not damage the the the strength and
[931.46 --> 936.02]  value of the MasterCard brand. And so they've got all these they've got all these guidelines
[936.02 --> 946.50]  for what that means. Now, I think it's very telling that the obvious solution to this isn't
[946.50 --> 953.86]  crypto. And that really, it kind of shows how far even though crypto has gone kind of mainstream to
[953.86 --> 960.58]  the point where my not super techie family is talking about it over Thanksgiving dinner. The fact that
[960.58 --> 969.06]  no one seems to actually see it as a viable solution to this is is kind of is kind of mind blowing to me.
[970.34 --> 978.82]  Um, yeah. Now let's talk about if the solutions are so simple, right? Why doesn't someone like
[978.82 --> 985.30]  floatplane just step in and fill this void? So why why why can't floatplane just become the new home for
[985.30 --> 989.54]  sexually explicit creators? I mean, we've even got we've even got a really wonderful
[989.54 --> 997.38]  mock up here, Luke, of what that might look like. This was made by I don't know if he wants to be
[997.38 --> 1001.94]  named for this specific creation. So I'll leave him off of it. But this was made by one of the
[1002.82 --> 1009.78]  floatplane guys. Yeah, the main reason right now, and the reason why we will probably stay out of it
[1009.78 --> 1016.02]  long term is not that we have any issue with it is that we're late. To be completely honest,
[1016.02 --> 1023.86]  like Anthony had mentioned his friend or acquaintance or whoever that is, already has another platform that
[1023.86 --> 1030.10]  they're planning to go to. Yep, these other platforms already exist. I even mentioned in my statement,
[1030.10 --> 1042.02]  a few different companies including Fan Centro, Just for Fans, ManyVids, Loyal Fans, all this other kind of stuff. They already exist. There's also sorry my voice.
[1042.02 --> 1044.66]  There's a Montreal company that makes
[1044.66 --> 1052.50]  a Montreal company named Bellessa that I believe already makes sex toys and already has a
[1053.22 --> 1061.06]  like our online explicit content streaming platform that is like really, really focused on on being ethical
[1061.06 --> 1067.30]  and all that kind of stuff already posed in their mission statement. And they announced like it was like
[1067.30 --> 1073.94]  today or yesterday. It was yesterday, they announced yesterday, that they're going to be pushing that
[1073.94 --> 1082.90]  platform towards like being the new OnlyFans. There's a lot of players in the space, it would take us a few
[1082.90 --> 1090.10]  months at least to hit the features that would be needed to provide a good experience for the users. And also,
[1090.10 --> 1097.86]  honestly, when we were looking through the like MasterCard demands, a lot of those things we were
[1097.86 --> 1103.54]  like, yeah, we should probably have this. Like it kind of makes sense. Like because you want to make
[1103.54 --> 1108.58]  sure that you're not having exploitation and stuff on your platform, obviously, you want to make sure
[1108.58 --> 1114.10]  it's a safe space for people to do the things that they're going to do on it. And a lot of those things
[1114.10 --> 1118.58]  should happen. So that's a lot of features to dev because those aren't the same features that you need
[1118.58 --> 1127.38]  on float plane. So it would take us quite a while to spin up. And there's, there's frankly, honestly,
[1127.38 --> 1134.02]  people that are probably going to be better at making that service than we are that are already on it. So
[1135.54 --> 1138.34]  as of right now, not in the works.
[1138.34 --> 1140.98]  So is this the end for OnlyFans?
[1143.54 --> 1146.18]  I mean, Tumblr didn't die, right?
[1146.18 --> 1152.58]  I guess that's fair enough. But is there a reason for me to use OnlyFans instead of
[1153.62 --> 1159.30]  something else at this point? Because I thought that was the whole idea is that Patreon
[1160.82 --> 1166.74]  narrowed the scope of what they allowed in terms of sexually explicit content. And then OnlyFans took
[1166.74 --> 1171.94]  off and then maybe there was a platform in between them that I'm missing, but now OnlyFans is doing
[1171.94 --> 1172.58]  the same thing.
[1172.58 --> 1178.34]  And it's a consistent story. And I haven't looked into all these different platforms that Balesa one,
[1179.06 --> 1183.86]  I checked out theirs and they do accept MasterCard. I'm not sure what payment platform they're using,
[1183.86 --> 1189.86]  but I do know that they accept MasterCard. So like, that's interesting. That being said,
[1190.66 --> 1195.78]  they're taking like one of their leading steps with this whole platform launch is that it's supposed to
[1195.78 --> 1199.78]  be ethical. So maybe they are just matching all of the guidelines. But like Linus said,
[1199.78 --> 1206.18]  there's still concerns there. So I'm not entirely sure. But yeah, I think to get away from the
[1206.18 --> 1210.74]  governance of these, these credit cards, these payment processors, you'd have to go, you'd have to
[1210.74 --> 1217.06]  go crypto. Like we were, we were doing some like theory crafting on like, okay, if we did this,
[1217.06 --> 1222.66]  how do we have to do it? And ultimately, we'd like want to meet the guidelines that MasterCard laid out,
[1222.66 --> 1228.98]  because they seemed actually like a good idea. But also, we probably wouldn't want to use them
[1228.98 --> 1235.06]  because they've consistently shifted goalposts and like change things. And yes, this time, those were
[1235.06 --> 1239.14]  pretty reasonable ethical changes. But you don't know what it's going to be in the future. And that
[1239.14 --> 1244.90]  like, brand alignment thing is way too vague, and just sounds like a gigantic trap. So you don't want
[1244.90 --> 1249.62]  to have to deal with those types of things. And the only way to get away from that stuff right now,
[1249.62 --> 1254.34]  ultimately, is to go to crypto, because if it was the payment processors, you could use a different
[1254.34 --> 1260.42]  payment processor. But when it's the cards as well, it's from the user side and the platform side. And
[1260.42 --> 1266.90]  that's crazy. And you don't know which brand is going to jump on next, like maybe Amex decides to
[1266.90 --> 1272.34]  do all the same rules. So okay, if you if you find a way to not take MasterCard, well, who knows how
[1272.34 --> 1276.50]  that's going to work long term. We've seen this happen to a lot of different platforms. So you'd have
[1276.50 --> 1283.14]  to decentralize, you'd have to go with something like crypto. So I mean, if none of these other
[1283.14 --> 1290.98]  platforms go to crypto, maybe there is space for us to jump in. But as of right now, we have we have a
[1291.54 --> 1296.90]  lot of other things we're working on. So yeah, I had someone in the chat that's like upset,
[1296.90 --> 1302.02]  we're talking about this exposing people who look up to us to this kind of website.
[1302.02 --> 1306.66]  David Vogelpohl Welcome to the internet.
[1306.66 --> 1309.46]  David Vogelpohl Welcome to the internet. I mean, Luke and I are not we're not endorsing
[1309.46 --> 1316.18]  or not endorsing any of these platforms. We are just this is technology. This is a this is a huge
[1316.18 --> 1324.02]  moment for online technology, whether you like it or not. The the adult entertainment industry has been a
[1324.02 --> 1330.02]  driver for technology over the over the decades, actually, not not the years. So that's what that's
[1330.02 --> 1336.18]  what makes this newsworthy from our point of view. And the other sort of the other side of that is
[1336.18 --> 1341.54]  that, you know, you can you can have your moral outrage over OnlyFans. And the answer is, okay,
[1341.54 --> 1348.42]  then don't use it. You know, we got a super chat from someone named August says I rely on my OnlyFans
[1348.42 --> 1353.14]  income to pay for cancer treatments can't work because of COVID slash cancer. I feel like my life is
[1353.14 --> 1358.66]  literally over and I'm terrified. You got to understand that for a lot of people, sex work is not
[1358.66 --> 1365.38]  sex work. It's just work. It's work. It's and you know, you can you can sort of you can have a moral
[1365.38 --> 1370.98]  sort of standpoint where you go, Oh, but it's, it's like worse, or it's this or it's that or I don't know,
[1370.98 --> 1376.50]  you can draw your line, wherever you you personally want to draw it. But that's the thing. That's that's you.
[1376.50 --> 1383.78]  That's, that's your personal line. I mean, as a sex worker might say, you know, I'm sorry, you lift heavy
[1383.78 --> 1391.38]  things all day for money, you are literally going to destroy your back for money. To them,
[1391.38 --> 1397.06]  the idea of taking off their clothes and snapping a picture. Obviously, it's not that simple cultivating
[1397.06 --> 1402.58]  a fan base is as difficult on OnlyFans as anywhere else. In fact, maybe even more so because it's paid.
[1403.14 --> 1409.14]  I'm just saying, you know, if you want to oversimplify these arguments, they could easily flip the script
[1409.14 --> 1414.66]  on you and say, Yeah, you would you would legitimately destroy your body for money. I mean,
[1414.66 --> 1422.50]  I'm only taking pictures of it. I Yeah, so you know, whatever, guys, just remember that whatever,
[1422.50 --> 1428.18]  whatever your whatever your personal sort of comfort level is with these kinds of services,
[1428.98 --> 1432.98]  that's that's that's personal, like that's you we're just talking about it from a technology standpoint.
[1432.98 --> 1440.58]  I guess that's pretty much it. For us. I mean, we're Yeah, we're not going to make a play for the
[1440.58 --> 1446.42]  space for a variety of reasons. You know, we just don't feel that we would have the tools in place
[1446.42 --> 1452.18]  in a timeframe that would make any sense to harbor these, these people, unfortunately. But the good
[1452.18 --> 1457.94]  news is that in our research, we managed to find a number of other platforms that hopefully will be
[1457.94 --> 1459.14]  successful in doing that.
[1459.14 --> 1466.26]  I know next to nothing about them. So if you're a creator on OnlyFans, I'm not endorsing any of
[1466.26 --> 1470.58]  these. But there, there are alternatives out there. And you should probably check them out. Also.
[1472.26 --> 1477.62]  Yeah, there's another one someone posted a chat about it's called AV, AVN stars or something like
[1477.62 --> 1481.46]  that. To be clear, I'm not saying to go to these sites at all, especially if you are for whatever
[1481.46 --> 1488.50]  reason, not allowed to go to them. But if you're a creator, who is already in this space, you know,
[1488.50 --> 1493.06]  I think it's time to do some shopping around find some discords to join where maybe you can talk to
[1493.06 --> 1498.18]  other people who have experiences both positive and negative to share about these platforms. And
[1498.18 --> 1503.62]  the more of you band together to find one that seems to be a good fit, the better the chances that
[1503.62 --> 1509.62]  migration will happen faster, and the users will will find you. Because it might be a time to
[1509.62 --> 1514.26]  diversify as well. Yeah, that's Yeah, that's not a bad point. I mean, there's nothing wrong with
[1514.26 --> 1520.34]  having, you know, YouTube memberships activated like we do, as well as having a platform like
[1520.34 --> 1525.46]  floatplane, where you post behind the scenes and stuff like that. Nothing wrong with diversifying your
[1525.46 --> 1531.54]  revenue streams at all from just a strictly business standpoint. In the short term, something that has
[1531.54 --> 1540.26]  generally flown under the radar is if you cosplay while doing those things. Just a just a tip.
[1541.06 --> 1546.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that that tends to help a fair bit. Callum says personally, I feel this is very
[1546.34 --> 1552.50]  harmful to the sex work industry. It seems like every legitimate and relatively safe avenue for sex
[1552.50 --> 1558.18]  workers is being blocked left, right and center. It should be allowed and not stigmatized. I mean,
[1558.18 --> 1563.62]  I think there's a strong argument to be made for that. Unfortunately, I'm not in a position where
[1563.62 --> 1569.78]  I can change anything about it. All I can say is sex workers work. As much as we like to think that our
[1570.98 --> 1579.94]  approach would be the very good or potentially the best one. Ultimately, it's a it's a big risk to spend
[1579.94 --> 1587.78]  many months developing new features and effectively a new platform. Obviously, we'd be able to copy out
[1587.78 --> 1595.14]  the vast majority of the work over. But it would be a pretty massive undertaking. And because we'd be
[1595.14 --> 1600.50]  really late, it would be a huge risk. And there's there's platforms already out there. And there's
[1601.22 --> 1609.06]  from like a I read a two paragraph thing on what that platform is on a list of alternatives.
[1610.18 --> 1614.42]  There's some that seem pretty promising. So hopefully those work out and we can just keep doing our thing.
[1614.42 --> 1621.78]  All right, why don't we move on to our next topic for today? What's the what's another big one? Ah,
[1621.78 --> 1630.26]  yes, Intel Arc. Intel Arc is coming not to be confused with Intel Arc with a K. This is Arc with a C.
[1630.26 --> 1636.82]  And that is going to be Intel's branding for their new high end graphics cards that they claim are going
[1636.82 --> 1645.62]  to be competing with Nvidia and AMD. The first Arc GPUs will be based on the Intel Xe HPG architecture
[1645.62 --> 1652.10]  with a GPU codename of Alchemist. I like it. I like it. It's a good codename. It's a solid codename.
[1652.74 --> 1658.74]  It'll have support for all the features that modern AMD and Nvidia GPUs possess including real time ray
[1658.74 --> 1665.86]  tracing, Intel's new AI accelerated super sampling or Xe SS is what they're calling it apparently that'll
[1665.86 --> 1672.98]  compete with FidelityFX and DLSS. Although FidelityFX is not an AI accelerated super sampling
[1675.86 --> 1683.54]  feature. It's it's oh man, shoot what um, Lankzos or how do you pronounce that? It's it's basically a
[1683.54 --> 1690.66]  different it's basically a different kind of anti-aliasing. They did a 1080p to 4k super sampling demo
[1690.66 --> 1695.94]  and it was performed in a slow moving environment without a lot of scenery changes.
[1696.50 --> 1699.94]  So it looks uh promising but also
[1702.02 --> 1706.90]  I don't know we'll see. So here let's go ahead and pull this up. Whoopsie doodles. Let's go ahead and
[1706.90 --> 1716.74]  put that right there. Oh yeah right there. So does that look good? Uh yes. Yeah looks really good. Looks
[1716.74 --> 1725.22]  really sharp not a lot of shimmering um or anything like that but as we noted it's really slow camera
[1725.22 --> 1734.18]  pans. Yeah and those are really not the most challenging situations. Also part of the whole
[1734.18 --> 1740.74]  deal with AI or machine learning based features is that it's dependent on how well they work is
[1740.74 --> 1746.26]  dependent on the data set. Now the way that it's supposed to work theoretically is that machine
[1746.26 --> 1753.78]  learning is supposed to be so powerful that it takes an enormous and diverse data set right and it
[1755.62 --> 1764.34]  and then it's able to use that to extrapolate and infer uh some some result right. Here
[1765.22 --> 1771.38]  I mean what did intel train this data set on? If they trained it entirely on what these scenes are
[1771.38 --> 1776.34]  supposed to look like obviously it would do a great job because it's not actually inferring anything.
[1776.34 --> 1784.02]  It just knows exactly what these objects are supposed to look like at a higher degree of fidelity. Um so
[1784.02 --> 1789.30]  that that there's a lot of potential. I'm not saying they cheated. I'm just saying that there's it would be
[1789.30 --> 1798.50]  very easy to cheat. Um so XCSS their super sampling will have two versions XMX which is designed
[1798.50 --> 1804.90]  specifically for XC GPUs and perform slightly better and DP4U which uses common instructions on all modern
[1804.90 --> 1811.22]  GPUs and should work on more than just intel GPUs and could even enable the feature for GPUs as far back as
[1811.22 --> 1819.78]  the GTX 1060 and 1050. No word on actual performance metrics so far but the intel trailer shows arc silicon
[1819.78 --> 1827.86]  running Forza Horizon 4, Metro Exodus, Crisis Remastered and other games. But again no performance metrics
[1827.86 --> 1833.70]  whatsoever. Intel will be using TSMC's six nanometer process for Alchemist meaning it will have to compete
[1833.70 --> 1838.74]  with the other companies manufacturing chips at TSMC in terms of allocation. So if you were hoping
[1838.74 --> 1845.14]  that Intel was going to be able to take their their chip foundries and sort of put an end to GPU
[1845.14 --> 1852.42]  shortages once and for all the answer is no they're going to be constrained by all the same industry-wide
[1852.42 --> 1862.10]  factors as Nvidia and AMD. Still though still though having Intel come in as a scrappy startup it's kind of
[1862.10 --> 1867.54]  funny to talk about them in that context but in the in the gaming GPU space they will be having Intel
[1867.54 --> 1873.94]  come in as a scrappy startup and try to try to hopefully buy some market share by our love
[1873.94 --> 1881.14]  will be only it can only possibly be a good thing for consumers and I am I'm extremely excited for the release
[1881.14 --> 1883.14]  which I believe is slated for
[1884.42 --> 1891.38]  Sometime in 2023 don't quote me on that. It's actually been a little while since I've double checked what the rumors are
[1891.38 --> 1894.42]  Let's check the let's check the roadmap here
[1898.26 --> 1904.34]  Yep, nope can't immediately find it. We don't have anything confirmed anyway. It's all just rumors at this point as far as I know
[1904.98 --> 1910.42]  What else do we have? Ah more Intel news Intel's newest lake has been detailed for the first time
[1910.82 --> 1917.06]  Official specs have been announced for Alder Lake. This is the successor to 11th gen core rocket lake
[1917.06 --> 1924.58]  It'll use the Intel 7 process so this was previously 10 nanometer enhanced super fin
[1925.14 --> 1933.46]  Okay, fair enough. It's a heterogeneous big little architecture with the performance course featuring a 19% improvement in IPC over rocket lake
[1933.46 --> 1940.34]  That is actually a pretty big deal and could put Intel ahead of AMD when it comes to gaming performance though
[1940.34 --> 1942.34]  Only time will tell
[1942.58 --> 1946.98]  Efficiency cores are faster per thread than sky lake, which is pretty exciting
[1946.98 --> 1950.58]  So even the low power like like crappy cores are
[1951.62 --> 1958.18]  Still pretty decent and there will be three physical designs eight performance plus eight efficiency
[1958.90 --> 1965.54]  For a total of 24 threads six performance plus eight efficiency for a total of 20 threads and
[1965.54 --> 1970.42]  And two performance plus eight efficiency for a total of 12 threads
[1970.42 --> 1976.42]  So only the performance cores are going to have Intel's hyper threading where they can process two threads per core
[1976.74 --> 1980.34]  They're going to run ddr5 at 4800 mega transfers per second
[1984.98 --> 1986.98]  Um
[1986.98 --> 1990.34]  Peak bandwidth increase of over 50% over the best ddr4 3200 memory cool
[1990.34 --> 1998.50]  PCI express gen 5 with up to 16 lanes coming from the cpu and then we're gonna have four gen 4 lanes for storage
[1998.50 --> 2000.50]  Intel has apparently determined that
[2000.74 --> 2004.50]  Gen 5 lanes are not necessary for storage. They're probably not wrong
[2004.90 --> 2010.18]  AVX 512 support has been removed. That's probably where some of that better ipc is coming from. They're just not
[2010.58 --> 2016.82]  Spending diarrhea on features that the vast majority of consumers will never touch and the tdp of the top end skew will be
[2017.86 --> 2018.98]  125 watts
[2018.98 --> 2026.10]  Uh, was this written by anthony? It was because it's got five quotations on either side of 125 watts
[2026.10 --> 2027.30]  We've gotten to the point where
[2027.94 --> 2033.38]  Intel amd and nvidia's tdp ratings of their chips simply cannot be compared against each other
[2034.10 --> 2038.02]  Without just objectively measuring them in the real world
[2039.22 --> 2046.26]  Intel also detailed their thread detector or thread director technology and emc inside the cpu
[2046.26 --> 2050.58]  So this will monitor each thread and its individual metrics so memory load store power
[2050.58 --> 2051.38]  Etc
[2051.38 --> 2057.22]  And provide data to the os scheduler which will decide where threads should go. That's pretty cool
[2058.10 --> 2060.74]  So processes could initially run on a p core
[2061.22 --> 2063.78]  Unless they're full or unless they're on battery
[2064.26 --> 2067.06]  It could tell the os which threads are best to move in
[2067.78 --> 2069.78]  On like a 30 microsecond scale
[2070.50 --> 2077.62]  um avx prioritized for p cores if there are more threads than available p cores it will use efficiency cores
[2077.62 --> 2081.22]  Before using hyper threading because those like sky lake grade
[2081.78 --> 2085.38]  Uh, even like bad cores are still going to be pretty fast compared to
[2085.94 --> 2088.34]  uh putting two threads on the same cpu core
[2088.98 --> 2093.54]  And it can reduce the frequency if a thread is limited elsewhere in order to reduce power
[2094.34 --> 2096.34]  That's pretty cool
[2096.50 --> 2099.78]  That's like actually super cool. Um
[2099.78 --> 2101.78]  Um, so per thread
[2102.50 --> 2106.66]  Intel is expected to be able to outpace amd's zen 3 processors, but
[2107.22 --> 2112.66]  AMD's core count advantage could keep zen 3 very relevant particularly at the high end
[2112.82 --> 2117.30]  Although that assumes that amd does nothing in response and they almost certainly will
[2117.30 --> 2121.54]  I love intel and amd being at each other's throats. This is the best thing ever
[2122.74 --> 2127.46]  Actually, no the best thing ever would be nvidia and amd being at each other's throats on gpu
[2127.46 --> 2132.02]  But right now it's basically nvidia running the entire show and amd being lucky to
[2132.58 --> 2137.62]  Ship any gpus and get any gpus made as far as I can tell they're basically
[2138.10 --> 2141.54]  um, I saw I saw a headline talking about how
[2141.62 --> 2144.74]  Nvidia prices seemed to have been falling a bit but amd ones weren't
[2145.22 --> 2150.74]  And I think a big part of that is just down to how many gpus amd booked with tsmc
[2151.62 --> 2153.62]  kind of that simple
[2153.62 --> 2159.70]  Uh, you know what we should probably get yeah, we should get through our sponsor spots the show is brought to you by
[2160.66 --> 2161.70]  Redux
[2161.70 --> 2167.46]  Thank you build redux for sponsoring this video redux is a pc builder that's striving to bring pc gaming
[2167.86 --> 2174.66]  To the masses they have no price markup on the parts themselves. You just pay a 75 build fee
[2174.66 --> 2178.74]  So pick your budget pick your games see how they're gonna perform
[2178.74 --> 2180.74]  And then if you're happy with it
[2180.98 --> 2186.90]  Let them build your pc and you get not only the built machine, but a two-year warranty for parts and labor
[2186.98 --> 2190.26]  So why wait start your build today at buildredux.com
[2191.30 --> 2197.14]  Linus the show is also brought to you today by elgato they're featuring their face cam
[2197.70 --> 2204.02]  It's available now and features an f 2.4 24 millimeter all glass lens
[2204.82 --> 2210.02]  Sony's starvis simo sensor for good performance under different lighting conditions, which is
[2212.26 --> 2220.50]  Definitely a must for streamers. It's got its full 1080p hd. It's usb 3.0 has an optimized fixed focus
[2220.82 --> 2225.86]  I actually learned about that recently when alex did that video on why webcams on laptops suck
[2225.86 --> 2231.22]  It's because they just they're just webcams are just really small and
[2231.78 --> 2236.42]  Having them be able having moving lens elements that can change the focus just isn't really viable
[2236.42 --> 2241.78]  So they just have to be at a fixed focus. That's about what they expect people to actually use
[2242.34 --> 2246.66]  Um, you can configure the face cam through elgato's camera hub app
[2246.66 --> 2249.70]  And it offers seamless mounting options including a quarter thread
[2250.26 --> 2254.74]  Quarter inch thread monitor clamp. You can learn more at the link down below
[2255.22 --> 2257.06]  Finally the show is brought to you by see sonic
[2257.22 --> 2262.34]  Seasonics prime ultra titanium pc power supplies feature ultra high efficiency with their 80 plus titanium rating
[2262.50 --> 2264.90]  They're fully modular feature hybrid fan control
[2265.22 --> 2271.54]  To control overall fan noise as well as fluid dynamic bearings so that they aren't too loud even when the fan is running
[2271.86 --> 2277.38]  They offer up to a 50 000 hour life expectancy along with a 12 year warranty and you can check them out at the link below
[2277.54 --> 2282.90]  We're gonna have both see sonic and amazon's websites linked where you can buy a see sonic power supply
[2282.90 --> 2292.98]  All right, let's jump into epic copying among us's game mode and then just kind of quietly not giving any credit
[2292.98 --> 2295.22]  I mean fortnight imposters
[2295.22 --> 2297.70]  Yeah
[2299.86 --> 2302.10]  Is this not the kind of thing where they could have just
[2302.82 --> 2309.94]  Could have just collaborated with the among us team to to put together a fun fortnight mode?
[2309.94 --> 2314.10]  You know, that's kind of similar to among us. They could have done, you know in game
[2314.66 --> 2317.22]  You know in game skins and stuff like that
[2317.22 --> 2318.74]  costumes and stuff like that
[2318.74 --> 2319.14]  Or among us
[2319.14 --> 2320.82]  Giving kickbacks to the among us team
[2321.94 --> 2324.66]  If if epic is trying to what even
[2325.38 --> 2328.58]  This is a terrible terrible teaser trailer. I'm getting rid of this
[2328.98 --> 2331.86]  um if I mean if epic wants to shake that
[2332.90 --> 2334.10]  um
[2334.10 --> 2336.26]  Image that they have of just being kind of
[2337.38 --> 2339.70]  Terrible people who do the right thing sometimes
[2340.34 --> 2341.38]  um
[2341.38 --> 2343.30]  That's kind of what we that's a good way of saying it
[2343.30 --> 2345.62]  Yeah, that's kind of what we were led to with the whole
[2345.94 --> 2350.82]  uh suing apple and suing google over their their crappy app store policies
[2351.30 --> 2353.62]  If they're trying to shake that image they gotta
[2354.18 --> 2357.62]  They gotta stop doing stuff like this. It's not that you can't make
[2358.34 --> 2361.78]  I mean that's art right you it's not that you can't make derivative works
[2362.34 --> 2366.10]  You just you have to give credit where credit's due you have to at least
[2366.82 --> 2374.10]  Acknowledge it you have to you have to work with someone like inner slot who uh inner sloth actually did end up calling them out
[2374.74 --> 2376.74]  um
[2376.74 --> 2382.26]  You can't just kind of quietly hope that nobody's gonna notice and another thing too is like
[2382.98 --> 2388.02]  People that are surprised. I find that very interesting because fortnight literally exists because of this
[2388.02 --> 2392.58]  They just they copied pub g right like
[2395.06 --> 2395.62]  Yeah
[2395.62 --> 2396.74]  Yeah, being among us
[2397.30 --> 2405.70]  Yeah, it was a little bit dramatic when fortnight first pivoted from there like zombie survival game or whatever it even was at the start
[2405.70 --> 2408.74]  It was something like that. It was like a zombie survival building
[2409.38 --> 2410.34]  Game
[2410.42 --> 2413.14]  Where you had you like built during the day and I don't even remember
[2413.14 --> 2419.06]  Was it single player at the beginning? I think it was multi I don't know no one cared about that mode pretty much at all
[2419.06 --> 2423.70]  The game was like a failure and then they copied pub g and then it was gangbusters
[2424.02 --> 2429.30]  And now they're doing the same thing. They're just copying among us like this is this is the same thing they did before
[2429.54 --> 2432.18]  People were pissed last time and they're pissed this time
[2432.74 --> 2433.70]  Um
[2434.02 --> 2436.26]  Yeah, someone at flow plane chat said epic is sus
[2436.26 --> 2445.86]  Uh, yeah, yeah pretty much it's it's like it's exactly the same thing except the tasks and the emergencies are different
[2446.42 --> 2453.86]  Uh, but they're still tasks and emergencies and you're in first person instead of a top-down view even just the similarity of the map
[2454.34 --> 2456.34]  was kind of
[2456.42 --> 2458.42]  Sus I think the kids say
[2458.50 --> 2460.50]  Yeah, kind of sus. Yeah
[2460.50 --> 2463.54]  And like yeah, the map yeah, I know among us has more than one map
[2463.54 --> 2465.06]  But I I feel like almost everyone
[2465.54 --> 2469.62]  Plays the majority of their time on the first map and the first map is like I believe a spaceship
[2470.26 --> 2474.66]  And just from I haven't played it but just from watching the video i'm pretty sure you're on a spaceship
[2475.54 --> 2477.54]  It's called imposters the
[2478.10 --> 2480.10]  Yes, this terminology is
[2480.18 --> 2485.46]  Possibly used in the in the old uh more tabletop or in-person versions of this type of game
[2485.94 --> 2486.90]  um
[2486.90 --> 2493.14]  But imposter is specifically a thing used in among us some people have pointed out like oh well, uh
[2493.86 --> 2497.62]  Among us is a rip off of those old board game style things
[2497.94 --> 2503.38]  I strongly disagree among us is very different. It's brought into a digital space. It includes the tasks
[2503.70 --> 2505.22]  uh, the the
[2505.30 --> 2511.86]  Killing of people is not done by pointing at them in a circle while everyone's like heads are down so they can't see
[2511.86 --> 2517.30]  Yep, it's done in a gamified sense like it's it's a very different take on that type of game
[2517.30 --> 2520.50]  Yeah, like a mafia or werewolf secret hitler type
[2520.66 --> 2524.74]  I mean, it's not like derivatives of this play style haven't existed for a long time
[2525.38 --> 2529.46]  It's that the import the fortnight imposters thing is barely even a derivative
[2531.14 --> 2534.10]  It's essentially a refresh of tasks and
[2534.66 --> 2540.74]  Emergencies which happens every time among us has a new map anyways, so that's not weird and then they made it first person
[2540.74 --> 2545.46]  Like there's there's there's no secret sauce here other than the fortnight user base
[2545.46 --> 2552.18]  Now, how would you compare this to something like league of legends then coming in and basically, you know
[2552.98 --> 2557.30]  Ripping off dota just at that point in time dota was a
[2558.18 --> 2560.02]  warcraft 3 mod mod
[2560.02 --> 2562.02]  um
[2562.66 --> 2566.66]  I I there hasn't been a ton of
[2567.78 --> 2572.58]  MOBAs that I would see as like a ripoff of the original dota format
[2574.10 --> 2575.86]  Since dota 2 came out
[2577.06 --> 2579.62]  Um heroes of the storm is very different
[2580.50 --> 2587.30]  Uh the new pokemon one. I think it's called pokemon rivals. I don't entirely remember but the new pokemon one which looks actually really awesome
[2587.30 --> 2589.30]  But I haven't played it yet, but I plan to you
[2589.62 --> 2591.06]  um
[2591.14 --> 2592.50]  Looks oh geez
[2594.82 --> 2596.58]  Mr. John wick in chat, uh
[2597.22 --> 2603.46]  Gets gets really hyped up anytime anyone mentions dota. Um, but yeah, like those games are quite different
[2603.46 --> 2607.30]  League of legends jumped into a space where there wasn't really
[2608.02 --> 2609.14]  uh a
[2610.18 --> 2615.46]  Full dedicated version there was just the ugc user generated content version there's here's a new earth back then
[2615.46 --> 2617.70]  But like yeah, I don't know. I think that's different
[2618.98 --> 2622.26]  I think that would be different like if someone right now made a
[2623.94 --> 2624.10]  Uh
[2625.06 --> 2631.78]  Tower defense game that worked extremely similar to winter mall wars. I don't think anyone's gonna go like oh you ripped off winter mall wars
[2632.98 --> 2636.26]  Because it was ugc right yeah, that's fair. Um
[2637.14 --> 2639.54]  I mean, I guess it's just becomes uh
[2639.54 --> 2644.58]  It becomes a much broader discussion of you know at what point are you are you ripping something off?
[2644.58 --> 2647.62]  And at what point are you adding your own special sauce? I mean, I think that
[2648.18 --> 2650.34]  For you and me we're just kind of looking at this going
[2650.34 --> 2653.94]  It doesn't appear as though epic has added enough special sauce with that said
[2653.94 --> 2661.30]  They clearly have something special in the sauce because fortnight continues to be wildly popular in spite of the fact that um
[2662.18 --> 2664.18]  And this will help us to do so
[2664.34 --> 2670.42]  Yeah, yeah, I mean if people if people love among us, but they're just kind of kind of sick of playing you know in 2d
[2670.42 --> 2675.38]  Yeah, fortnight's probably gonna win some users over with this and at the end of the day
[2675.38 --> 2681.38]  I think it has been proven time and time again that no matter how evil or awful a company is people will continue to
[2682.02 --> 2688.58]  Support them and continue to give them money as long as they continue to make a product that they want for a price that they can afford
[2688.58 --> 2690.26]  So here we go then
[2692.10 --> 2692.66]  Um
[2692.66 --> 2698.98]  Also in the news to this week gigabyte has responded to the exploding power supply accusations
[2699.46 --> 2701.46]  Blames the media
[2701.62 --> 2706.10]  So basically i'm just gonna read gigabyte statement then we're all going to laugh
[2706.66 --> 2714.66]  Gigabyte is aware of certain media outfits casting doubt over the quality of power supply models gpp850gm and gpp750gm
[2714.66 --> 2722.74]  We were made aware by third parties of concerns regarding potential issues of these models tripping at high wattages when tested via
[2722.98 --> 2732.02]  dc electronic load equipment for extended lengths of time repeatedly close to the 120 to 150 over power protection trigger point
[2732.26 --> 2738.10]  This level of extended testing could severely reduce the lifespan of the product and the components of these power supplies
[2739.14 --> 2743.30]  Okay, the problem is that gamers nexus saw failures before excessive use and
[2743.30 --> 2745.54]  Many of them failed in two minutes or less
[2746.10 --> 2748.66]  Apparently nothing went more than 10 minutes
[2749.22 --> 2754.82]  Gigabyte is offering to replace your unit if your serial number is within the proper ranges that they have decided
[2755.38 --> 2760.02]  And so I guess you guys are gonna have to go check out the details on that
[2760.50 --> 2762.66]  Let's see gamers nexus this is the video
[2763.54 --> 2767.54]  Does extreme tech have a link for how you can contact gigabyte support here?
[2768.82 --> 2772.50]  Yes, they do have the serial number so anything from sn20343
[2773.30 --> 2775.30]  G031011
[2776.50 --> 2780.10]  To you know what i'm not going to bother reading it there. It is. It's down there
[2781.62 --> 2788.50]  So if you have any serial number within that range you can get a replacement and a big part of the reason so many people have these power supplies
[2788.50 --> 2793.78]  Was due to the new egg shuffle and it kind of feels like to a lot of people that a
[2793.78 --> 2798.50]  Kind of lousy product was being forced on buyers so that they could get a chance to get a graphics card
[2798.50 --> 2802.10]  Not that they would be playing halo infinite on that graphics card because
[2802.58 --> 2808.42]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I love that segue so I like apologize for taking that from you
[2808.42 --> 2813.22]  I'm sorry, but you got to check out the image I sent you on discord. This was posted on
[2813.86 --> 2820.58]  uh reddit by user instilled b i'm hoping they created it. I don't see credits for it very nice
[2821.70 --> 2827.86]  um and it's just it's hilarious and I feel like it's happening. Uh, so I wanted to make sure people saw it
[2827.86 --> 2834.42]  I mean, that's the thing they gotta understand steve. He's like a dog with a bone man. He doesn't give up
[2834.90 --> 2837.54]  It's not like your little statement is gonna make
[2838.42 --> 2846.02]  The crappy power supply go away like he's in the process right now of soliciting his community to send him these power supplies
[2846.50 --> 2850.82]  So that he can continue to test them and continue to demonstrate across a wider
[2851.78 --> 2853.78]  sampling of them that they are bad
[2853.78 --> 2855.38]  Um
[2855.38 --> 2860.10]  So I mean the truth will come out and the good thing about steve is that if he does ultimately discover that
[2860.66 --> 2863.62]  Nope, he just happened to get a bad batch. I do expect him to
[2864.34 --> 2866.34]  to own that so
[2866.58 --> 2870.74]  Yeah, i'll i'll be paying i'll be paying very close attention to this one in the coming weeks. Yeah
[2871.94 --> 2877.86]  Halo infinite will not ship with co-op or forge now the forge map
[2878.98 --> 2881.94]  Building mode will launch in season three that's six months after launch
[2881.94 --> 2886.18]  And I don't believe this is the first time that a halo game has launched without forge
[2886.82 --> 2887.14]  um
[2888.90 --> 2892.42]  So yeah, there won't be a forge map building mode. Okay, whatever, but
[2893.06 --> 2894.74]  co-op
[2894.74 --> 2896.66]  Co-ops not going to be there at launch
[2897.70 --> 2902.66]  Okay, it's coming in season two which should release three months after the initial launch, but come on
[2903.94 --> 2908.18]  I guess it just means i'm gonna have to uh, i'm just gonna have to wait a little bit longer
[2908.18 --> 2912.82]  Yeah, this and maybe with season two there will be a discount or something because i'm not buying it to let us go out
[2913.06 --> 2917.38]  Like I I don't care. I yeah, this opens up a much broader discussion
[2917.62 --> 2922.02]  Like what features are okay for a game to launch without like at what point?
[2922.66 --> 2929.94]  Do we switch from calling it? You know a gold release or a game release and just start calling it mvp minimum viable product?
[2929.94 --> 2931.14]  like
[2931.14 --> 2935.14]  Are we buying a game or are we subscribing to a service clearly microsoft?
[2935.46 --> 2938.34]  um, what with game pass and all that is
[2939.22 --> 2941.86]  Kind of taking the the latter interpretation of things
[2943.38 --> 2946.58]  I mean the thing that I don't the thing that like really
[2947.38 --> 2949.06]  Gets me is
[2949.06 --> 2955.06]  It's been quite a while right. It hasn't been an insane amount of time. We've I mean skyrim released of
[2955.06 --> 2961.70]  10 years ago basically and there's there's no real uh release date for elder scroll 6 in sight
[2962.10 --> 2966.74]  um, but halo 5 was october of 2015
[2967.78 --> 2970.26]  Like you couldn't wait a little bit and launch with co-op
[2971.86 --> 2977.22]  Come on. I mean the next logical step. I mean the whole like seasons thing is
[2977.70 --> 2984.02]  You know to me as sort of an old school gamer is kind of crazy and the next logical step is obviously putting content in temporarily
[2984.02 --> 2987.86]  And then it just goes away. I think it was you luke that I was talking to about
[2988.18 --> 2990.34]  uh, a game that one of the float plane devs plays
[2990.90 --> 2998.90]  Where there'll be these enormous events that they run in game was it not you where all that content just gets just gets wiped out
[2998.90 --> 3001.78]  Yeah, um, what game is it? Oh man, what is it called?
[3003.14 --> 3008.50]  They're gonna jump in in slack and tell me i'm sure uh, jonathan. It's the one you play and yuki
[3009.14 --> 3011.30]  Maybe they don't want everyone to know that. I don't know. Um
[3014.02 --> 3016.02]  Oh, it's it's like a
[3016.82 --> 3021.62]  Maybe this will help the community. It's a super weeb game. That's like on desktop and on mobile
[3022.98 --> 3025.38]  And it's it's it gets compared to breath of the wild
[3027.30 --> 3029.22]  Uh, maybe I can find it with those search terms
[3030.18 --> 3032.18]  It's not genshin impact is it
[3032.42 --> 3033.54]  Yep
[3033.54 --> 3034.74]  Okay
[3034.74 --> 3038.10]  Hey, yeah that comes up if you search up weeb game breath of the wild
[3040.02 --> 3042.02]  Awesome
[3042.02 --> 3044.02]  It worked okay. I wasn't
[3047.54 --> 3052.18]  I was trying to I was trying to find the answer all right. I wasn't trying to yeah, but yeah, um
[3053.22 --> 3054.66]  I don't remember what event it was
[3054.66 --> 3057.78]  But one of them was talking about a really cool event that the game had and then it disappeared
[3059.22 --> 3066.82]  And that's the thing. I mean just playing rocket league. There's been some temporary events like there was a there was a ghostbusters
[3067.54 --> 3068.74]  Halloween
[3068.74 --> 3072.82]  Uh, nick just said genshin impact. That's what you said, right? Yep. Yeah
[3073.22 --> 3075.62]  Um, there was a ghostbusters halloween event
[3076.10 --> 3078.10]  That was so much fun
[3078.58 --> 3080.58]  But it only lasted for like two weeks or something
[3080.98 --> 3085.86]  Right and then gone forever if you happen to like have a life and have to do something else for a little bit
[3086.10 --> 3088.98]  That's it. You're done. You missed it. You're out
[3088.98 --> 3095.94]  Just like if you don't get the color you want right away, you might miss it. You're done. You're out
[3096.90 --> 3103.30]  Ltt store lanyards are now available in a wide variety of colors 999 us dollars
[3103.38 --> 3106.42]  Lttstore.com. It's a perfect time to order a
[3107.14 --> 3110.82]  A lanyard so you can also get one of the new spout lids for the ltt water bottle
[3110.82 --> 3113.86]  They are a big improvement over the old ones
[3114.42 --> 3117.06]  Because they have a little like drinking spout and all that
[3117.06 --> 3118.10]  Um
[3118.10 --> 3122.98]  Also, if you buy a spout and a water bottle at the same time, we still have a promo running where the spout lid is just five bucks
[3123.94 --> 3127.22]  So go check it out. I've actually been rocking the pink one for a little while
[3127.70 --> 3132.58]  Saw a couple of youtube comments asking me about that. Hey, what's up with that pink linus tech tips lanyard?
[3132.90 --> 3138.02]  It's because we had a whole bunch of new colors coming and I wanted to kind of test drive them. These things are
[3138.66 --> 3144.74]  Absolutely like bulletproof in terms of the quality of the stitching. It's all metal in here
[3145.06 --> 3147.94]  It's one of those ones where I just I look at it and I go
[3147.94 --> 3153.06]  I don't understand why cheap lanyards even exist because even really nice lanyards are
[3153.94 --> 3159.06]  Really cheap to make so hey, this is a perfect time for us to appreciate the wonderful
[3159.94 --> 3161.94]  color selector and all that
[3162.18 --> 3169.30]  Hey, look at that now. Hold on a second. Did we like photoshop these to change the color? No, we actually took individual pictures in the same pose
[3169.70 --> 3171.70]  of every single color of lanyard
[3172.26 --> 3173.38]  That's so
[3173.38 --> 3180.26]  It's so meticulously specific now that is attention to detail ladies while you were talking about that
[3180.26 --> 3184.82]  I had already been like skipping through them being like are these the same? Yeah, no, they're not. No, they're not
[3186.26 --> 3191.46]  That's pretty funny. All right. Hey, good good work team. Good work. I actually do think that is
[3191.94 --> 3195.30]  A good use of time because you should do things properly or do them not at all
[3195.30 --> 3202.50]  What's the point of having a picture of different like colors of something if it's not actually a picture of it in that color?
[3202.50 --> 3204.50]  If it's just a photoshopped representation
[3205.62 --> 3208.66]  uh, nick says hoffman number one photographer xd
[3210.18 --> 3214.82]  All right another thing uh linus was talking about if things go out of stock and ltd store
[3214.82 --> 3221.22]  If there is something currently out of stock or in the future if there's something out of stock we now have back in stock notifications
[3221.70 --> 3224.74]  That can be specific to the size and color or
[3225.30 --> 3226.34]  variant
[3226.34 --> 3227.38]  uh
[3227.62 --> 3232.26]  So like if it's one of the plushies for example, it might not be a size or color thing. It might be a variant thing
[3232.58 --> 3237.30]  Um, so you can get a specific back in stock notification for that specific type of thing that you want
[3237.70 --> 3242.34]  Uh, so if something runs out on ltd store sign up for that notification and you'll know when it's back
[3242.34 --> 3249.62]  All right, let's do some super chats here. I had a few people asking me before the show over on float plane about colton's tattoo
[3249.62 --> 3251.78]  They asked is it actually real?
[3253.06 --> 3253.30]  Yes
[3253.30 --> 3256.34]  He actually tattooed
[3256.34 --> 3260.42]  So you know why he tattooed ltdstore.com because that wasn't part of the challenge
[3261.30 --> 3262.98]  Do you know why he did?
[3262.98 --> 3266.58]  Because you pay for tattoo artist time by the hour
[3266.58 --> 3270.90]  We paid for a full hour and she was done in 45 minutes and he was like well
[3271.30 --> 3273.62]  I want to make sure I get our full money's worth here
[3274.26 --> 3276.58]  What else should I get in 15 minutes?
[3277.14 --> 3277.78]  So we like
[3278.34 --> 3285.78]  Scambled got attempt got a uh, uh, not a template a um a stencil printed out and she went to town got it done
[3285.94 --> 3287.06]  I'm sitting here going like
[3288.42 --> 3290.98]  It's not even your money like I paid for it
[3290.98 --> 3295.86]  I would have been perfectly comfortable with you just getting the one that you actually threw the dart at
[3298.02 --> 3300.82]  Uh, if you guys don't know channel super fun is back
[3301.46 --> 3307.14]  And the first video up is um a tattoo sort of it's a combination of things
[3307.62 --> 3310.26]  Yeah, there's there's tattoos involved
[3310.90 --> 3314.50]  We end up pranking the wives and such and such
[3315.06 --> 3320.18]  Uh, yeah, so it's it's pretty good. It's pretty fun. Me dennis and colton having a pretty good time there
[3321.46 --> 3327.38]  Oh, man. Yeah, love it. So go check it out. Make sure you don't miss it. We've also got some super chats to go through today
[3329.22 --> 3334.42]  Um, dr q says screw only fans give anthony a linux channel. I guess that's responding to the title of this video
[3334.98 --> 3342.02]  Uh, oh, you know what we are gonna have is a uh, facebook is sponsoring a series of live audio rooms over the next little bit
[3342.10 --> 3345.30]  And there's going to be one that i'm hosting with wendell
[3346.02 --> 3349.22]  Next friday that just that just reminded me of that
[3349.22 --> 3351.22]  So make sure you don't miss that
[3352.66 --> 3354.66]  um
[3355.38 --> 3359.94]  Callum says oh wait, I already went through that one adrian says lt car channel when I mean right now
[3359.94 --> 3365.54]  We just put the car videos on lt and on short circuit and that's I think what we're going to do for the for the near future anyway
[3366.66 --> 3370.98]  Ultra nero says with the galaxy fold 3 launching. I was curious about the longevity of the device
[3370.98 --> 3374.26]  Would it survive three to four years of use? What if I was careful with it?
[3375.22 --> 3377.94]  Three or four years out of a phone all comes down to
[3379.22 --> 3384.18]  How you are using it are you being careful with it? I mean, I think that there's a solid chance
[3384.18 --> 3388.82]  Yes, it could last three to four years. I also think it'd be very easy for it to be dead in three to four months
[3391.30 --> 3391.70]  Um
[3391.70 --> 3392.90]  Um
[3392.90 --> 3396.02]  J dog says intel gpu seem interesting. Hopefully it'll make
[3396.58 --> 3399.94]  The market more diverse. Yes, that's exactly what i'm hoping for honestly
[3399.94 --> 3401.46]  I don't even care if they're the best thing ever
[3401.46 --> 3406.74]  I don't even care if one ever ends up in my computer as long as they end up in someone's computer
[3407.22 --> 3409.22]  Yeah, that's what we need
[3409.70 --> 3411.22]  Andrew says I have a knock to any
[3411.22 --> 3418.66]  My CPU package at 74 on idle 100c while gaming you might still have uh, you might still have your uh
[3419.54 --> 3423.38]  Your your plastic peel on there with idle temperatures that high
[3424.18 --> 3428.98]  Load temperatures being high that is just because your cpu got you know, a little toasty
[3429.38 --> 3431.30]  But if you have really high idle temperatures
[3431.78 --> 3434.26]  Like you're talking 44 degrees above ambient
[3434.26 --> 3439.30]  Mm-mm. There's something wrong. Uh, it could be that there it's not screwed down all the way
[3439.30 --> 3443.06]  It's not clamping properly. You can pop it off and have a look at the thermal compound
[3443.30 --> 3448.02]  And you can google images for you know, what it should look like when it's making proper contact
[3450.74 --> 3456.18]  Cat herder cam says gigabyte is denying rmas inside that serial number range and their rma site has
[3456.74 --> 3462.42]  Been down since august 3rd. I've been trying to return a borked mobo and they've told me there's nothing they can do until the servers back up
[3462.42 --> 3466.82]  No eta. I had noticed some issues with gigabytes website as well. What is up with that?
[3466.82 --> 3472.66]  There was some I don't think it made it into the docs, but there was some bigger stuff like they had a malware takeover. I believe
[3472.66 --> 3474.26]  Um got it
[3474.26 --> 3476.82]  You keep doing those and i'll try to find the news on that
[3477.14 --> 3481.14]  Uh ghost potato says among us seems like it was inspired by town of salem though
[3481.14 --> 3483.94]  The games are pretty different. There's definitely lots of similarities. That's fair enough
[3483.94 --> 3490.98]  But as long as you're adding your own spin on it, I think that's um, that's what people are upset about and the other thing is just that
[3491.78 --> 3495.30]  Epic does so many collaborations with fortnight
[3496.26 --> 3500.82]  Why not do it as a collaboration then it could have been a super positive thing for everyone
[3501.38 --> 3508.50]  But instead it had to be not a collaboration. Oh, not this time. I think that's where some of the anger is coming from as well
[3510.50 --> 3514.66]  Um, jordan hardy says with all these games releasing as multiplayer only these days
[3514.66 --> 3520.18]  I'm actually pretty happy halos including the single-player campaign at least and worrying about co-op etc later
[3520.18 --> 3521.86]  I mean, I okay that's fair enough
[3522.50 --> 3525.38]  There was actually yeah, I guess I didn't fully answer that question
[3525.38 --> 3528.50]  There was a question posed at one point in time, which was like what is acceptable
[3529.46 --> 3531.30]  Or for this and I I think
[3531.86 --> 3535.62]  halo has potentially an issue of standing on the shoulders of its
[3536.26 --> 3537.62]  previously
[3537.62 --> 3539.62]  giant versions, um, yep
[3540.18 --> 3544.90]  But it it has established that halo like halo grew because of couch co-op
[3544.90 --> 3550.66]  A hundred percent like yeah halo 2 halo 3 popped off because of online original halo
[3550.66 --> 3556.98]  The reason why people cared about those games a huge amount when they when they launched was was because of couch co-op
[3557.14 --> 3562.50]  There was there's so much new like if you look back at what made the original halo games huge
[3562.98 --> 3567.94]  It's undeniable. Um, so to not include co-op in the new version feels like a slight
[3567.94 --> 3574.02]  That being said a huge amount of modern shooters don't have single-player campaigns and that sucks
[3574.34 --> 3577.22]  I've always loved single-player shooter campaigns
[3577.70 --> 3581.06]  Um, and i've always loved that they have generally had co-op so
[3582.34 --> 3586.66]  Yeah, I don't know. I'm happy that it's going to include it eventually. I'm sad that it's not there by default
[3586.66 --> 3595.30]  Oh, here we go. I'm curious what colors are most popular for the new lanyards
[3595.30 --> 3600.66]  I actually want you to try and guess at this we've already sold a whack of them. So i've got it. I've got enough data
[3601.06 --> 3605.46]  Um, I just want to get through a few more super chats and then we can uh, we can go through
[3605.46 --> 3610.74]  I have a look at the rainbow of colors available and let me know which one which ones you think are most popular
[3610.74 --> 3614.58]  I think i've already made a guess. Oh for number one. I think i've already made a guess, but yeah
[3614.58 --> 3616.98]  Vitor asks when will be the next ltt
[3617.70 --> 3622.02]  Um expo we're hoping for 2022 probably summer
[3623.30 --> 3629.22]  Uh, thanks for the happy birthday wishes some of you. Uh, callum says oh you missed my super chat. Yeah, it's not in here
[3629.22 --> 3633.06]  It's a stupid bug. I reported it to youtube. See it's not it doesn't go up high enough
[3633.06 --> 3636.26]  I clicked the thing right before we started the show, but then I didn't
[3636.74 --> 3642.58]  Uh click it again right as we started the show. So a bunch of them disappeared right as I loaded the tabs so stupid
[3642.58 --> 3644.58]  Um, thanks larry gans
[3645.14 --> 3647.94]  Um, misail says tesla robot your thoughts
[3648.74 --> 3654.18]  Yeah, this was a topic in the doc and the reason that I didn't end up talking about it was
[3654.82 --> 3655.30]  um
[3656.18 --> 3657.70]  I just don't know what to say
[3658.82 --> 3659.70]  like
[3661.62 --> 3663.70]  Yeah, in theory it's cool
[3664.58 --> 3665.62]  um
[3665.62 --> 3671.06]  In theory, you know terraforming mars with a nuke is cool. The the issue is that
[3671.06 --> 3677.78]  um elon has made a lot of promises over the years that have not turned out to be a reality and
[3678.34 --> 3683.38]  I I think it's great to have visionaries that are looking into the future and trying to make things happen
[3683.94 --> 3686.98]  but I I also think we need to stop taking
[3687.54 --> 3691.22]  what he says at face value and we need to look at it as
[3692.10 --> 3693.22]  um
[3693.54 --> 3697.46]  You know and uh more like you know more like a kickstarter
[3698.10 --> 3699.06]  Right
[3699.06 --> 3703.62]  So some kickstarters, um end up being very successful. I mean the model
[3704.10 --> 3707.94]  the model 3 is is by any measure a success
[3708.74 --> 3713.70]  as a product as a movement, you know getting people to accept even the idea of
[3714.26 --> 3718.66]  consumer oriented like like real real people not just you know
[3719.30 --> 3724.66]  uh luxury car buyers like a real people electric car like it's such an important product but
[3724.66 --> 3732.34]  a lot of a lot of what elon's companies have delivered has has not fully um
[3733.38 --> 3735.22]  met the promises that he's made. I mean
[3735.62 --> 3738.34]  uh starlink is another example of a huge success story
[3738.34 --> 3744.18]  So I think we just need to kind of run it through a kickstarter filter. We need to sanity check it. We need to
[3744.74 --> 3748.58]  um not get our hopes too high like we need to set our expectations
[3749.22 --> 3750.58]  reasonably um
[3750.58 --> 3757.78]  Some of the hype sorry contain the hype yeah until it actually lands. Yeah, I mean when they actually deliver
[3757.78 --> 3762.98]  I mean you look at what boston dynamics is doing with their robots. You guys see that parkour video unbelievable
[3763.62 --> 3769.78]  But then you see tesla's mock-up and you kind of go. Yeah, you're not going to be able to like boston. We already know like boston dynamics is
[3771.14 --> 3777.30]  One of if not the leader in that space. They're way bulkier. They're heavy. They're like
[3777.30 --> 3782.18]  And tesla's mock-up just it looks like a mock-up. It looks like fantasy
[3782.66 --> 3788.74]  And until they actually deliver something with that that level of of functionality and performance
[3789.22 --> 3796.02]  I i'm it's just you know, i'll wait for the stage demo and hopefully you know the the the window doesn't smash or whatever, right?
[3796.98 --> 3797.30]  Yeah
[3797.30 --> 3800.10]  Uh, the gigabyte thing by the way, uh, yeah
[3800.10 --> 3805.94]  It was posted on august 6th. Apparently they got hit by ransomware by the ransom x gang
[3806.50 --> 3809.62]  Um, and they took 112 gigabytes of business data
[3810.34 --> 3811.70]  Um
[3811.78 --> 3816.74]  And they said they were going to release it on the dark web unless the company hit their ransom demands
[3816.74 --> 3819.46]  I'm, not exactly sure how this story concludes, but
[3820.10 --> 3824.98]  Yeah, it's just that callum says it doesn't matter. It was missed just wanted everyone in chat to have a lovely day
[3825.86 --> 3829.94]  Uh, I love everyone. It's hard, but i've been there and we'll get through this love to all
[3830.34 --> 3831.38]  All right, thanks calum
[3832.26 --> 3834.26]  Uh, all right, so are you ready?
[3834.90 --> 3841.78]  I want to know what you think is the top selling color of the new ltt lanyard you are not gonna get it
[3842.66 --> 3843.46]  No, no
[3846.34 --> 3850.02]  Orange not even close. Okay, that's number three
[3850.98 --> 3853.06]  Dang, I thought orange or black
[3854.74 --> 3856.42]  Uh, no, it is neither of those
[3856.42 --> 3861.38]  It's not pink is it is it pink you seem too excited for this
[3862.10 --> 3862.98]  It is
[3864.98 --> 3866.98]  Not pink pink is kind of in the middle of the pack
[3867.70 --> 3868.74]  Okay, weird
[3868.74 --> 3872.58]  One and two are both surprising to me
[3872.58 --> 3876.18]  At this point, I feel like i'm just gonna go through the whole rainbow. Um
[3877.14 --> 3879.62]  Is it white? Nope, that's almost dead last
[3880.18 --> 3884.74]  I mean, I can see that a white lanyard has the potential to get dirty. We just wanted to offer it as an option
[3885.22 --> 3885.94]  I yeah
[3886.98 --> 3891.22]  Someone's gonna want it because it's gonna like match their favorite set of shoes or something
[3891.22 --> 3895.54]  Yeah, I don't know or they might be the kind of person that has like multiple lanyards and actually like changes them out
[3895.54 --> 3896.98]  It's pretty easy to do
[3896.98 --> 3899.78]  Uh, because especially with the construction of this one it just
[3899.78 --> 3907.22]  Like goes on to your existing loop so you just you could easily swap them out with your different outfits or whatever
[3907.22 --> 3908.66]  I don't know people are into
[3910.02 --> 3915.70]  Um, I just brought up the colors so I could review it. I thought I was gonna nail it with either orange or uh
[3916.58 --> 3917.70]  black, but
[3918.50 --> 3919.62]  um
[3919.70 --> 3924.10]  Let's go with the the darker of the blues because yeah, that's number one
[3924.66 --> 3929.70]  Number one is royal blue followed by purple fold closely by purple. They're almost tied really then
[3929.78 --> 3931.78]  orange then acid green
[3932.82 --> 3937.70]  Whoa, I was not expecting acid green to be a popular one. It's very vibrant
[3939.94 --> 3945.14]  So yeah people are going for those like neon stuff. Yeah, people are going for really really bold colors
[3945.94 --> 3947.94]  acid green
[3948.50 --> 3952.42]  Uh, oh nick said those three have been the most popular internally so far as well
[3952.90 --> 3954.58]  And you know what else is popular internally?
[3955.30 --> 3958.42]  Ending the show so linus and luke can both start their weekend
[3960.26 --> 3965.86]  Thank you guys very much for tuning into the wanshell. We will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[3966.82 --> 3968.82]  Bye
[3968.82 --> 3988.90]  I feel like i've gotta get me one of those sky blue ones to go with float plane
[3988.90 --> 3993.62]  Oh, wow, this is a great question from dust pierce that I missed
[3994.42 --> 3995.06]  um
[3995.06 --> 3996.98]  When you get a hold of the steam deck, can you
[3997.46 --> 4004.42]  Test it with the merseize I forget how you pronounce their but but with the m cable to see what their hardware upscaling looks like
[4004.42 --> 4007.22]  Yeah, that would actually be a really great application for that
[4007.70 --> 4011.94]  And thank you for the review of the black ltt lanyard tech gizmo bought it two years ago
[4011.94 --> 4014.82]  It's held up great still looks new tempted to buy another heck. Yeah
[4017.62 --> 4022.74]  Uh, oh nick asks if I will do a confirmation of the framework investment
[4023.22 --> 4029.38]  The answer is yes, I decided to go ahead, but i'm going to do a full video outlining sort of all of my thoughts about it
[4029.38 --> 4035.46]  So it wasn't something I was going to do as a wan show topic, but yes, I I decided to pull the trigger yesterday
[4035.46 --> 4039.46]  Okay, that's it for the show. Bye guys. Bye
[4046.66 --> 4048.66]  Um
[4048.66 --> 4051.62]  This is weird youtube will not let me end the show
[4052.98 --> 4055.86]  Because i'm not logged in are you kidding me?
[4057.86 --> 4060.02]  So you got doc signed out at like the end
[4061.14 --> 4062.98]  unreal
[4062.98 --> 4064.34]  engine
[4064.34 --> 4066.34]  Okay, okay
