[0.00 --> 7.60]  welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[7.60 --> 13.36]  but unfortunately that's really as long as i can maintain that up upbeat kind of tone of voice
[13.36 --> 23.86]  uh because i am furious kind of upset i'm i'm pretty angry and i want to get into it in in full
[23.86 --> 32.08]  detail later but the long short version is that youtube disabled the dislike counter on the
[32.08 --> 36.52]  platform so some people have got it rolled out already some people are still seeing dislike
[36.52 --> 43.30]  counts but they are all going to be gone within days is my understanding and this has an enormous
[43.30 --> 51.94]  impact on the usability of the platform massive for certain users that in my opinion doesn't outweigh
[51.94 --> 58.70]  the benefit for other users but certainly um makes it so that we should probably at least
[58.70 --> 65.20]  consider other options rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water here in other news amd has
[65.20 --> 73.16]  some huge data center tech incoming this is really freaking exciting because they just continue to
[73.16 --> 80.44]  make everyone else look like clowns which is which is great what else we got pinch to zoom is forbidden
[80.44 --> 91.18]  in the court of law stop doing it what okay oh wow okay uh okay good i like this second note here
[91.18 --> 98.48]  about this topic uh what else we got oh sweet maybe we should just skip that one also microsoft releases
[98.48 --> 106.36]  se products it might also mean still edge okay let's go ahead and roll that these topics are great
[106.36 --> 136.26]  and the show is brought to you today by pebblehost freshbooks and see sonic all right i want to start
[136.26 --> 144.58]  by justifying youtube's removal of the dislike counter so to be clear they are not removing the dislike
[144.58 --> 151.38]  button you can still indicate to the creator of the video whether you liked which will show publicly or
[151.38 --> 157.06]  whether you disliked which will show only in the creator's dashboard that particular piece of content
[157.06 --> 163.64]  and the thing about a dislike is that it doesn't provide any kind of constructive feedback all it does
[163.64 --> 171.72]  is pretty much blow uh you know raspberry at the creator of that video and say i disliked it
[171.72 --> 181.24]  it definitely serves no purpose other than to share whatever negative feelings you have and in some cases
[181.24 --> 190.60]  that can be a harmful and destructive force so one of the big reasons that google has provided for
[190.60 --> 197.16]  um actually here we've got the the youtube blog post where they they provided their rationale one of
[197.16 --> 203.24]  the main reasons that youtube provided for making this change was that it would be a way to make the
[203.24 --> 210.44]  platform more inclusive and promote respectful interactions between viewers and creators their goal
[210.44 --> 216.60]  is also to reduce dislike attacks where communities will actually work together to drive up the number of
[216.60 --> 225.40]  dislikes on a creator's video so their justification for moving ahead with this particular change is that
[225.40 --> 231.16]  they actually um did a lot of experimentation this is something that to my knowledge they've been working
[231.16 --> 240.92]  on for the better part of a year at least rolling it out as a kind of a test um across a wide variety of
[240.92 --> 248.12]  different user groups and uh evaluating whether it changes the way that users interact with video
[248.12 --> 257.88]  content and ultimately from what i understand so far youtube's data suggests that there is no discernible
[257.88 --> 266.04]  change or maybe even a positive discernible change to user behavior as a result of removing this particular
[266.04 --> 270.60]  indicator because now you can't tell if the video is bad until you watch the whole thing luke hold on we're
[270.60 --> 276.52]  playing devil's advocate right now you need to stop you are well i thought that we were on a wavelength
[276.52 --> 279.24]  here i thought okay
[282.12 --> 282.36]  so
[285.16 --> 292.68]  wow where do we start i just hate all of it so anywhere well okay okay first no i'm not done playing devil's
[292.68 --> 296.92]  advocate i need to do a little bit more devil's advocate because the devil needs an advocate that's
[296.92 --> 302.92]  for sure devil i mean look who the devil's up against jesus walks on water that's okay that's
[302.92 --> 308.12]  you god literally creates a world in six days that's pretty and then chills in the hammock yeah okay
[308.12 --> 315.32]  devil what can the devil do nothing weak exactly what turn into a snake needs a lot of blame
[315.32 --> 321.40]  lame oh i'm a snake go eat an apple bro yeah exactly what what if they didn't eat the apple then
[321.40 --> 327.96]  what exactly terrible it's like terrible b to c tier smash bros character all right so you heard it
[327.96 --> 335.16]  here first i'm now the devil's advocate okay so there are smaller creators out there that are applauding
[335.16 --> 342.28]  this change and no okay there is there is no there is a justification but see we can't
[342.28 --> 353.32]  that's the fundamental problem right now in the world is that people are not willing to see someone
[353.32 --> 357.96]  else's point of view i didn't stop you from talking and keep going bro people are not willing to put
[357.96 --> 365.96]  themselves in someone else's shoes and try to try to see it from their perspective so yes there are
[365.96 --> 372.84]  smaller creators out there that to a far greater extent than established ones like me do suffer
[372.84 --> 378.68]  from these kinds of negativity bombs on their content it's just going to move to comments so and
[378.68 --> 385.48]  that's fair the justification here though is that for the smaller creators who are disproportionately
[385.48 --> 391.08]  affected by dislike bombing comments are relatively simple to moderate
[391.08 --> 401.24]  okay okay okay now let's start to break it down comment moderation tools on youtube i wish i had my
[401.24 --> 409.00]  bleep button because they are terrible the automated moderation is beyond useless and even the manual
[409.00 --> 418.44]  moderation tools i requested over a year ago okay in my mobile creator studio app on a comment i can report
[418.44 --> 426.60]  spam or i can um i can remove all comments from this user from my channel but for some reason i can't
[426.60 --> 433.00]  do both at the same time why would that be reporting spam should automatically give you an option to
[433.00 --> 439.16]  remove all of course it should yeah of course it should yeah because what i want to do is i want to
[439.16 --> 445.08]  remove all their crap from my channel because they're clearly posting unwanted commercial content yeah and
[445.08 --> 450.92]  what i would also like to do is mark it as spam so that i can contribute to to the the greater
[450.92 --> 457.08]  community's uh knowledge that this user is garbage so hopefully they'll like click my profile for pics
[457.08 --> 463.16]  please stuff will go will automatically be removed from everyone's channels we so so really what we need
[463.16 --> 469.08]  to do what they could have spent this development time on is developing better comment moderation tools
[469.08 --> 474.20]  so that we can uh so we can better moderate the discussions in our videos now to be clear i don't
[474.20 --> 479.48]  actually expend a lot of energy moderating discussion because uh we're at we're at the point now where
[479.48 --> 484.52]  we've reached that critical mass where if someone comes in and they want to attack me personally or
[484.52 --> 490.04]  luke personally um also always allowed that like one of our forum rules that was that essentially you
[490.04 --> 496.52]  could you could go after us but not other people yeah so but but what but what happens and the reason
[496.52 --> 501.64]  that that's okay is because if someone really does criticize us in a way that's unfair we have a
[501.64 --> 506.04]  large enough supportive community that will come to our defense and will make those arguments for us
[506.04 --> 510.92]  on our behalf so we don't have to go in and reply to and moderate every single stupid comment it's
[511.48 --> 516.52]  it's it's it's just not it's not constructive it just doesn't contribute anything right so so i have
[516.52 --> 522.60]  the luxury of being able to have that kind of open communication policy with the community because of
[522.60 --> 527.16]  my position and i have to recognize that right so one of the things youtube could have done was they
[527.16 --> 531.40]  could have they could have improved comment moderation tools which they still haven't done now that might
[531.40 --> 538.52]  be on the road map but in my opinion based on how many like like how is it that anyone other than
[538.52 --> 547.40]  jimmy donaldson can have mr beast in their username at this point how is it even possible yeah you know
[547.40 --> 555.24]  how how how how how is it that you know especially like looking at a community like reddit how is it
[555.24 --> 563.88]  that reddit comments are so curated that if you sort them by top which is the default sorting on youtube
[563.88 --> 570.68]  if you sort them by top there is basically no garbage unless you throw on your fishing boots and wade into a
[570.68 --> 577.56]  particularly toxic also just for i think i don't know if i could say ever but for years has just not
[577.56 --> 583.24]  really worked uh top on reddit on youtube oh on youtube well of course not on reddit it works great
[583.24 --> 589.16]  so that's what i'm trying to say you know why it works on reddit because downvoting stuff is really
[589.16 --> 598.20]  important it's just it's a really valuable signal yeah so let's talk about the value of the dislike
[598.20 --> 605.32]  signal to be clear i'm not saying we don't need another solution we do need a solution to dislike
[605.32 --> 611.56]  bombing one solution could be that creators on a creator by creator basis could have the ability to
[611.56 --> 620.60]  hide public dislikes or what they could have is you know what maybe ultimately it comes down to i mean
[620.60 --> 623.88]  this is something i've suggested multiple times and i'm sure it's something that they've trialed and maybe
[623.88 --> 629.48]  this doesn't work but if you force people to fill out a form when they want to dislike a video make
[629.48 --> 637.08]  it a chore why why do you not like this make it make it a why you know turn it into use use machine
[637.08 --> 642.36]  learning that would actually be sweet that would solve a lot of the reasons well i mean the dislike
[642.36 --> 647.24]  thing is still there um but that would directly address a lot of the reasons why i think the dislike
[647.24 --> 652.28]  button needs to be there it's giving a reason because in some situations i think it needs to be there for
[652.28 --> 658.36]  all for safety a lot of people go to youtube for learning how to do diy things at home if someone
[658.36 --> 665.40]  gives you a really bad guide that can lead you in a potentially dangerous direction that's which is
[665.40 --> 670.76]  absolutely a thing and people would point it out and dislike the video and then you can see like
[671.32 --> 675.64]  even if it doesn't go all the way down you can see oh it's controversial it's like 50 of the way i
[675.64 --> 680.84]  wonder why scroll down to the comments see probably a fairly highly thumbs up comment that's like uh this is
[680.84 --> 686.60]  dangerous for like these reasons yeah that's it's really nice and not just like physical danger
[686.60 --> 693.40]  right like over the last month believe it or not i've spent a lot of time trying to find guides and
[693.40 --> 703.16]  tutorials for trying to get obscure things done on on an operating system that most people don't daily
[703.16 --> 707.80]  drive particularly for gaming i'm going to back you up on this i have literally used i just thought of a
[707.80 --> 712.84]  use case right now i've literally used the like to dislike ratio on videos for helping me with linux
[712.84 --> 719.16]  stuff in the last month so we probably both did that extensively yeah when i see something that has
[719.16 --> 725.64]  and particularly on smaller videos it's extremely helpful when i see something that has 300 views
[725.64 --> 733.08]  and has 20 dislikes and one like yeah i look at that and i'm like see ya and i might bookmark it for
[733.08 --> 739.64]  later because maybe those 20 people just couldn't follow instructions that's entirely possible but
[739.64 --> 748.84]  what it means is that i can i can prioritize right i can decide on a method of attacking this problem
[748.84 --> 755.32]  where i go okay i'ma go for the more likely ones first because a lot of really obscure solutions that
[755.32 --> 761.80]  you're trying to find have a really low number of people who have ever needed to find out about it and
[761.80 --> 766.76]  especially a low number of people who've ever wanted to make a video about it and that particular
[766.76 --> 776.12]  use case just got absolutely demolished on youtube for me yeah like i already am more of a reader than
[776.12 --> 781.64]  a video watcher i i just i find written articles easier to skim i find them more time efficient
[782.44 --> 790.44]  now youtube has taken away the one freaking tool that i had to quickly and easily skim
[790.44 --> 796.60]  the validity of a video i can no longer do it do you have the this is slightly off topic but for
[796.60 --> 803.56]  written articles do you have the instinct where you go like roughly i i'm saying it it's it's a it
[803.56 --> 807.88]  happens automatically it's muscle memory but i think i go like three to four paragraphs into every
[807.88 --> 812.20]  written article because i'm just expecting there's fluff because they want me to load the ads do you
[812.20 --> 817.56]  you just automatically no no i just i just read i don't see ads i can't see them i have a i have
[817.56 --> 823.80]  a learning disability i i can't read ads um so i just i honestly just don't notice them i just i'll
[823.80 --> 829.72]  load up anything just be like swoop over the years i've had so many people look over my shoulder or walk
[829.72 --> 835.24]  up to me and i'm like doing something and they're like how do you not use adblock and i'm like huh why
[835.24 --> 840.68]  would i need it and they're like 60 of your screen is covered in ads i'm like oh yeah i don't see it
[840.68 --> 846.12]  how about that yeah i don't know i just i can't see them okay now
[848.92 --> 856.04]  to be clear i don't have all the solutions here for the for the real valid problem which is people
[856.04 --> 862.92]  getting dislike bombed for things that are no fault of their own but i think there are at least possibly
[862.92 --> 868.68]  solutions is this brigading could you could you moderate if you turned every dislike into a comment
[868.68 --> 875.48]  for example could you moderate those could you go through and you could say you know i remove this
[875.48 --> 880.12]  this this this this this this and this and then it comes off of your public dislike counter because
[880.12 --> 885.80]  that's the kind of thing that i don't think would affect tutorials right so i i don't know
[885.80 --> 890.12]  people can remove dislikes how would it not affect tutorials well because i i think a lot i
[890.12 --> 894.84]  think i don't think uh okay i don't agree you don't have to turn off main power just be a man
[894.84 --> 899.96]  it wouldn't help with anything malicious it might help with a bad guide for replacing a light switch
[899.96 --> 905.40]  because that person probably hardly knows how to use the youtube dashboard or they're just like really
[905.40 --> 909.48]  it's it's the problem that we actually run into a lot yeah where they could be just really good
[909.96 --> 914.44]  yeah and so they don't have to worry about whatever thing and it wouldn't help with like
[914.44 --> 919.48]  some crypto scam or whatever else like that where they're they're intentionally yeah where they're
[919.48 --> 926.60]  intentionally trying to control uh dislikes um so i i don't i don't have a perfect solution that much
[926.60 --> 933.08]  is very clear um you know maybe you could make it so that there's gate like a gating a gating function
[933.96 --> 941.24]  if this like hugely disproportionate number of dislikes piles up on a video in some amount of time
[941.24 --> 947.48]  you could throttle it so that's an example right you could you could shadow ban users ability to
[947.48 --> 953.00]  dislike videos you could just outright i mean as it is my understanding is you have to log in to dislike
[953.00 --> 960.20]  a video anyway so you could remove all dislikes from banned accounts you could monitor again this is
[960.20 --> 966.60]  something that i believe a company with the resources of google could figure out i think that you could
[966.60 --> 973.56]  monitor particularly hateful or destructive users and just shadow ban their dislikes across the entire
[973.56 --> 980.92]  site yeah that's something that i believe could be done so i'm not saying i have the solution i am
[980.92 --> 989.00]  saying that there is one and what where the dislikes that you're talking about dislike bombs is this
[989.00 --> 994.92]  brigading yeah so like this is a creator or a member of some community yeah like let's say a large
[994.92 --> 1001.16]  amount let's say someone comes out as trans sure for example yeah and then some some toxic subreddit
[1001.88 --> 1007.24]  is like oh let's go dislike their video let's go dislike the crap out of their video and make them
[1007.24 --> 1011.56]  make them feel bad in a vulnerable moment right that's the kind of thing we're talking about here
[1011.56 --> 1015.72]  i guess it becomes more difficult if it's from off site because you were just referencing off site yeah
[1016.28 --> 1021.32]  they can track that that's yeah so you know where the traffic's coming from if they're clicking a link
[1021.32 --> 1027.72]  from reddit and it's like hmm no one disliked this video except for 100 of the people that clicked
[1027.72 --> 1034.12]  this link that came from this source yeah they can try to figure that out maybe you can moderate
[1034.12 --> 1040.60]  um the the actions of brigading that gets spurred up by communities on youtube itself maybe you can do
[1040.60 --> 1044.92]  more for the issue instead of just being like oh people are using this wrong so we're just going to
[1044.92 --> 1049.24]  take it out nh4x4 tracker says you could make it a requirement to watch a certain portion of the
[1049.24 --> 1053.64]  video this is actually something that i have pitched in the past and i i don't know how you would enforce
[1053.64 --> 1058.60]  that i don't know how you would ensure that they're not bots but what you would absolutely be doing is
[1058.60 --> 1063.96]  you would be increasing the barrier to entry to participate in these kinds of problems so if that is
[1063.96 --> 1071.16]  actually the problem i believe it is a solvable one and i believe that it's one that youtube could
[1071.16 --> 1077.24]  maybe say okay temporarily we're gonna remove the dislike counter while we engineer a solution to
[1077.24 --> 1085.16]  this i would accept that sure but taking that it's a tool right dislikes are a tool they're a tool that
[1085.16 --> 1091.96]  i use as a creator uh i use it to monitor sentiment on other creators videos or topics and your own hey
[1091.96 --> 1098.76]  is well i have access to my own still right right so i could i could look at okay uh oh i think people
[1098.76 --> 1104.04]  aren't gonna click dislike as much though if they don't see it austin worked with facebook or
[1104.04 --> 1107.80]  something like that let's say i don't know if austin's worked with facebook lately um you know
[1107.80 --> 1112.20]  what's the sentiment what's what's the i can take the temperature of the community i can be like okay
[1112.20 --> 1116.68]  how big of a deal is it going to be if i were to take a facebook sponsorship right like so i'm
[1117.56 --> 1122.68]  obviously i've i've picked an intentionally controversial company right now um but that that's a way that
[1122.68 --> 1127.48]  we've used it in the past it's like you know hey these guys had a sketchy past but it looks like
[1127.48 --> 1132.04]  they've turned over a new leaf and they're treating their customers better okay here's a
[1132.04 --> 1136.28]  creator that just took a sponsorship from them are they getting roasted and i could go down and i
[1136.28 --> 1141.16]  could read comments for days but it's nice to be able to do a quick temperature check so this is a
[1141.16 --> 1146.60]  tool that i use as a creator and it's a tool that i use as a consumer of content online as well usually
[1146.60 --> 1152.76]  in the way that you're describing it to to avoid wasting my time with content that is going to end up
[1152.76 --> 1157.56]  misleading me whether it's unintentionally like the expert electrician who doesn't feel like he has
[1157.56 --> 1162.52]  to turn off the mains power or whether it's intentionally with like a cryptocurrency spam or
[1162.52 --> 1167.80]  an attempt to steal my credentials there's lots some kind of phishing scam and that's a big problem is
[1167.80 --> 1174.44]  if youtube invested all this engineering that they did into testing dislike removal into figuring out how
[1174.44 --> 1181.56]  to remove the spam fake content from their site man that probably would have been a better use of time
[1181.56 --> 1186.76]  i think so it's this tool and tools can be used for harm right this is something that i was talking about
[1186.76 --> 1192.60]  in a discord with some other creators where i basically went like look tools can be used for harm
[1192.60 --> 1197.96]  but that doesn't mean that they're a bad tool hammers are a good tool but you can't guarantee it's going to
[1197.96 --> 1204.60]  hit a nail no you can't so instead of throwing away our hammer what we've decided what what we should
[1204.60 --> 1212.84]  be doing is building a safer hammer yeah and i i absolutely think that with the talent and intelligence
[1212.84 --> 1219.08]  of the team at youtube that this is something that they could do now i want to talk about really for me
[1219.08 --> 1227.64]  one of the biggest problems with this entire move and in my opinion what i think is and take this for the
[1227.64 --> 1234.52]  ignorant ignorant ignorant speech that it is i think the far bigger reason for this is that youtube
[1235.16 --> 1241.88]  dislikes have turned into a negative pr problem for the platform not just the platform but a lot of
[1241.88 --> 1247.80]  other companies as well if you if you actually think about the most uh communally well-known things that
[1247.80 --> 1253.96]  have been disliked yes they're all corporate things not all rebecca black friday for example okay that's
[1253.96 --> 1260.28]  fair is an example of community dislike bombing someone into into insecurity so let's not pretend
[1260.28 --> 1264.36]  these things haven't happened i saw someone in the chat that's like sure no that doesn't happen yes
[1265.24 --> 1270.12]  it does that's a good example so that that conversation can end now it does happen but i
[1270.12 --> 1277.16]  believe there are better solutions that don't have to completely take away this useful tool sure um but i
[1277.16 --> 1282.44]  think like the the reddit comment from back in the day um that was talking about how with battle for
[1282.44 --> 1286.20]  i think it was battlefront 2 and i think it was talking about how if you you would have to put
[1286.20 --> 1289.64]  like thousands of hours into the game to unlock every item or something if you didn't want to
[1289.64 --> 1293.08]  pay to buy things i don't remember exactly what it was there was a big world warships controversy that
[1293.08 --> 1297.88]  was very similar where they ended up getting disliked because their holiday thing was like physically
[1297.88 --> 1302.76]  impossible to actually right i remember that yeah so like these things tons of dislikes makes them
[1302.76 --> 1307.72]  popular because their amount of dislikes there's a lot of different corporate videos on youtube that
[1307.72 --> 1313.48]  are either extremely out of touch or or like the terry cruz uh amazon commercial that just went up
[1313.48 --> 1322.36]  that's a perfect example of something that rightly um is being mocked internet wide lots of things that
[1322.36 --> 1329.00]  blizzard has ever put in video form um lots of things from gaming companies in general to be completely honest
[1329.00 --> 1339.32]  uh it's it's not always a good look for companies and it is often talked about like a news thing that
[1339.32 --> 1345.88]  i fairly often get in my feed is like so and so announcement video from so and so company is getting
[1346.68 --> 1352.12]  shrekt by dislikes and then i'll go watch it to figure out why people hate it so much and then i
[1352.12 --> 1358.28]  immediately understand and it's like okay cool and then i move on and this is something that could be
[1358.28 --> 1365.80]  done in the comments but it's a waste of time and and modern people's usage of computers you've got
[1365.80 --> 1376.04]  seconds you've got very very minute so it's very clear that youtube's goal is to is to obfuscate this
[1376.04 --> 1382.20]  data they they want to hide this data from you why the answer is pretty obvious more watch time so you
[1382.20 --> 1386.68]  have to actually watch the content in order to figure out so i can understand from youtube's perspective
[1387.40 --> 1392.12]  why they might look at their data from their trials for this and go well everything is fine
[1393.24 --> 1399.64]  because from their perspective i guess everything is fine if there's more watch time and there might
[1399.64 --> 1406.28]  even be more viewer satisfaction because if you plugged the average viewer in front of a youtube browser
[1406.28 --> 1411.80]  window and we're like okay yeah do your like normal thing they're gonna go and they're gonna watch you know
[1411.80 --> 1418.84]  clips from the late show or they'll go and check out whatever the latest thing mr beast uploaded is
[1418.84 --> 1426.04]  they're gonna look at a lot of content for which the dislike counter is not relevant yeah and if anything
[1426.04 --> 1431.72]  yeah is probably really positive is probably destructive like it's it's probably good content
[1431.72 --> 1438.44]  that somebody disagrees with and and they're gonna kind of go oh yeah this is like actually this is
[1438.44 --> 1444.28]  actually a better experience but because of that they're they're ruining it for the people who actually
[1444.28 --> 1453.96]  need it and i want to say uh again a type of a type of pr disaster that in my opinion dislikes have a caused
[1454.52 --> 1463.00]  but b enabled youtube to become a better platform are maybe not common but they absolutely occur
[1463.00 --> 1469.48]  yeah so let's talk about you know one of the most disliked videos on the platform the i forget which one
[1469.48 --> 1474.52]  of them it was i'm so sorry you're you're definitely different people but one of the paul brothers
[1475.08 --> 1480.60]  um yeah the the suicide forest video yeah okay this is something we didn't really touch on at the time
[1480.60 --> 1488.84]  because it was fairly obvious that that was a spectacularly stupid thing to do um one of the things
[1488.84 --> 1497.16]  one of the ways that media coverage of that particular event uh was able to snowball was based on like
[1497.16 --> 1504.92]  oh there's a lot of community backlash which is which can be measured through dislikes by allowing
[1504.92 --> 1513.88]  people to express their displeasure with something that a creator has done youtube enables communication
[1513.88 --> 1520.84]  to be not just two-way right they enable the viewers to communicate with each other and i don't
[1520.84 --> 1526.12]  want to hear it right when youtube come back comes back to that's right too when youtube comes back and
[1526.12 --> 1530.84]  says well yeah but they can communicate with each other in the comments you guys are constantly
[1530.84 --> 1537.32]  hiding the comments farther and far particularly on mobile oh yeah you are constantly hiding the
[1537.32 --> 1542.28]  comments under more and more layers of crap that i have to click on or scroll through so i don't want
[1542.28 --> 1550.76]  to hear it right dislikes are one of the ways that the community can punish and can brigade in a way that is
[1550.76 --> 1559.88]  justified behavior that is unacceptable it's a really important tool it is one of the few levers that a
[1559.88 --> 1568.92]  viewer community can pull to say we are united in absolutely hating what you just did and one of the
[1568.92 --> 1575.40]  the things that i'm not going to be helpful sometimes i mean uh logan paul got 60 million views on his
[1575.40 --> 1581.08]  i'm sorry video i i don't i don't want to get into youtuber apology videos right now that's that's really
[1581.08 --> 1588.84]  not the point but what i do want to talk about is when the mistake is not just um an error in judgment i
[1588.84 --> 1597.00]  would say that the suicide forest video was an egregious error in judgment but i don't think that it was i think it
[1597.00 --> 1602.52]  was impulsive and stupid i don't think it was malicious i don't think it was it was you know
[1602.52 --> 1608.20]  sitting there the night before trying to brainstorm the most disrespectful thing you could possibly do
[1608.20 --> 1611.00]  and then going and making a video about it the next day i really don't think it was about that
[1611.96 --> 1616.20]  but let's talk about when a creator does something that is legitimately harmful and i don't want to get
[1616.20 --> 1622.52]  into any names here because it's just not it's not on brand for me i'm not i'm not a draw a youtube drama
[1622.52 --> 1629.64]  creator i i want no part of it um but let's talk about when creators for example abuse their position
[1629.64 --> 1637.56]  to take advantage of a minor which is something that has been a problem yeah multiple times
[1638.76 --> 1646.76]  dislike bombing dislike brigading is one of the ways that a viewer community can signal not just to
[1646.76 --> 1655.80]  the creator but to the entire world that they do not stand with that half-assed apology or with this
[1656.76 --> 1663.24]  weak attempt to be like i'm back and everything's fine or whatever it is and that's where it's it's
[1663.24 --> 1669.80]  not even you're not even really like sending a command to your army to like brigade this person's video
[1669.80 --> 1675.80]  you're you're pointing out that it's egregiously horrible and people are overwhelmingly agreeing with you
[1675.80 --> 1679.64]  um which is kind of its own thing but it's going to look exactly the same
[1683.88 --> 1693.16]  um hiero says removing dislikes also makes bought or botted likes um less easy to uh notice that is
[1693.16 --> 1701.48]  true if you have like a a 99.8 like to dislike ratio that is something that sets off a red flag for me
[1701.48 --> 1707.88]  if i'm if i'm looking at something like that um faustini says why would they just not let the
[1707.88 --> 1712.20]  creators decide if they want public dislikes on their channel so they could do that the issue with
[1712.20 --> 1716.92]  that is that particularly for scammers i don't think that's a good solution because they'll be savvy
[1716.92 --> 1721.00]  enough to just hide their dislikes publicly yeah um
[1726.68 --> 1736.44]  yeah i i i feel like those are the main the main issues for me are the potentially harmful videos that
[1736.44 --> 1741.88]  will not have as obvious warnings on them and you know back to comments not being good enough i mean
[1741.88 --> 1747.24]  think about the kinds of scams you read like do you do you read about i i don't know i've clicked
[1747.24 --> 1752.52]  on them a few times my google news feed is often full of like here's a scam that you know this senior
[1752.52 --> 1758.84]  citizen fell for and they lost their entire life savings to someone to someone who phished their
[1758.84 --> 1763.64]  their credentials or whatever the case may be youtube channels and stuff put it before but like way too
[1763.64 --> 1771.56]  much do not expect a non-tech savvy user to navigate their way through that the hidden layers on top of
[1771.56 --> 1779.96]  a comment section to figure out that some guide to fixing their internet connection isn't just a phishing
[1779.96 --> 1788.92]  scam one of the ways we can defend these people is by disliking the crap out of these videos and i think
[1788.92 --> 1794.52]  that this a lot of people have said well youtube already has a solution you can disable ratings on
[1794.52 --> 1800.68]  your videos but i think that even even a below average computer user knows that if the ratings are
[1800.68 --> 1806.12]  disabled that's probably a bad sign so you can't point at that as a solution for creators because i
[1806.12 --> 1811.80]  think that would really hurt their ability to reach a broader audience i i will click off a video
[1811.80 --> 1818.12]  pretty quickly if i see ratings outright disabled so to me it's more a question of moderation and less
[1818.12 --> 1822.84]  a question of should they be disabled outright because if if our solution is well people should
[1822.84 --> 1827.88]  just disable them then youtube made the right move they already did it they disabled them and
[1827.88 --> 1832.28]  if you disable them for everybody then you're not singling anybody out right so i understand the
[1832.28 --> 1838.76]  rationale i understand why they did it they are just harming the community's ability to communicate
[1839.40 --> 1846.68]  and they are harming the viewers ability to quickly and easily filter out misleading or potentially
[1846.68 --> 1853.00]  dangerous content that is an enormous problem and one that quite frankly if youtube comes to me and
[1853.00 --> 1860.68]  says oh yeah we totally like we totally found that this was 100 fine i call you did not
[1861.48 --> 1868.92]  i promise you you did not because you didn't do this yet and scammers didn't go oh this is great this
[1868.92 --> 1874.60]  is awesome and start doubling down on their strategy now that they know that you can't dislike bomb them out of
[1874.60 --> 1881.40]  existence anymore like we haven't seen the impact yet you can't study the effect of something you haven't
[1881.40 --> 1881.64]  done
[1885.16 --> 1886.68]  not great don't like it
[1888.76 --> 1893.00]  yeah but we burnt potentially close to half the amount of time we have for the show on that so
[1893.96 --> 1899.96]  okay um i mean it might be fine these other things you know yeah i'm i'm sorry i'm just i'm pretty
[1899.96 --> 1905.40]  passionate about this because no it's okay it cheeses me too i genuinely use a like to dislike a lot and
[1905.40 --> 1911.88]  like you said if i see a video that has ratings or comments or both disabled i just immediately think
[1911.88 --> 1919.64]  it's like some corpo trying to hide their stuff but i'm just like see ya like it's i i i somewhat
[1919.64 --> 1927.40]  religiously follow those metrics um i will very often follow it up like if a video is super disliked
[1927.40 --> 1932.20]  i'll go to the comments and try to see why yeah because it could be disliked because they wore the
[1932.20 --> 1936.84]  wrong color of lip gloss they don't like someone's voice or something like i don't care about that yeah
[1936.84 --> 1942.44]  so like yeah i i will check why um and and i honestly think a lot of people would because people
[1942.44 --> 1946.04]  are naturally curious so they're gonna be like okay why is everyone so upset about this video
[1946.04 --> 1953.24]  um and sometimes it's it's yeah sometimes it's not a very good reason at all and sometimes it is
[1953.24 --> 1958.12]  a super good reason and i'm very happy that i knew that it was bad because sometimes if i'm looking up
[1958.12 --> 1963.64]  especially a guide like we've referenced a bunch of times if i'm looking up a guide i probably don't
[1963.64 --> 1970.68]  know very much about said thing yeah so i'm not going to know if the guide is bad uh yeah frustrating
[1970.68 --> 1977.40]  um can you tell me how this interface works what do you mean uh how do i make it so that it pops up
[1977.40 --> 1983.32]  there oh that's not a thing yet oh okay all right well we're we're working on that uh guys guys um
[1983.32 --> 1989.48]  by all means shop on ltcstore.com but the cutoff for merch messages is now i'm not going to have a ton

[2116.52 --> 2122.04]  around as long as me they're the kind of company that will probably actually exist in 12 years to
[2122.04 --> 2126.44]  honor that freaking warranty so don't wait if you need a power supply upgrade go check them out at
[2126.44 --> 2137.80]  csonic.com or at the link down below oh okay i'm all i think i'm all it's good i think i think people
[2137.80 --> 2144.76]  should be worked up about this kind of stuff because uh as we've seen sometimes if part of
[2144.76 --> 2149.08]  the community is upset about something it can be a little bit difficult to you know reach through the
[2149.08 --> 2156.60]  noise and youtube's got one heck of a community so i have a call making a noise is good on tuesday
[2156.60 --> 2163.56]  about this or just in general i will be speaking to the product manager who worked on this cool um i i feel
[2163.56 --> 2167.96]  like i need to kind of gather my thoughts even a little more than i did now and make sure that i'm
[2167.96 --> 2175.08]  in a good headspace i don't think that what i'm saying is going to change anything um i don't it i i
[2175.08 --> 2180.68]  doubt it too the fact that they've been working on this for a year means that ultimately i i don't think
[2180.68 --> 2185.16]  my voice matters in all of this but the fact that they're at least giving me an opportunity to talk
[2185.16 --> 2191.88]  about it i feel like it would be irresponsible for me to not yeah present my side and explain why it's
[2191.88 --> 2197.00]  really important to me and why i would i would love for us to find another solution and you know
[2197.00 --> 2203.08]  like i said i would be i would be happy if youtube came in some okay look we're gonna turn it off for
[2203.08 --> 2210.04]  six months while we while we dev something better i'd be like okay now we're compromising now we're
[2210.04 --> 2218.12]  working together on this instead of you just taking something that is really valuable to me because
[2218.12 --> 2224.84]  it's harming someone else i don't want someone else to be harmed 100 yeah and again the people
[2224.84 --> 2229.64]  denying that that's happening you're living in a bubble yeah it happens it's definitely a thing
[2229.64 --> 2236.44]  it's 100 a thing i mean you got to understand like i wasn't always a 10 million subscriber creator
[2236.44 --> 2243.72]  right i've seen it i've i've done something totally innocuous innocuous like having kind of a high
[2243.72 --> 2249.40]  pitched voice and been attacked for it for years for years actually yeah like and some other stuff
[2249.40 --> 2254.76]  which was it which was all bs like it used to actually yeah to to back line us up it used to
[2254.76 --> 2262.04]  kind of cover ldt comment sections like it was it was actually pretty intense and so stupid so like i i
[2262.04 --> 2268.20]  get it and i understand that we have to make the platform a safer place not because oh people can't
[2268.20 --> 2273.00]  stand to have their feelings hurt or whatever but because we want it to be a vibrant and growing
[2273.00 --> 2278.84]  community we want utterly unique content to proliferate on the channel because otherwise it's
[2278.84 --> 2285.88]  going to stagnate like it is in my best interest for youtube to have as many creators telling as many
[2285.88 --> 2291.80]  totally different stories as possible because that rising tide is going to lift all ships i'm into it
[2291.80 --> 2302.60]  i think there's a better solution yeah all right why don't we move on oh we shot part four uh yesterday
[2302.60 --> 2307.48]  and today yeah so should we should we kind of spoil it for them like what do you want to do do you want
[2307.48 --> 2313.08]  to tell an anecdote that is not making it into the video maybe or there's actually quite a few of those
[2314.92 --> 2320.76]  guys so here why don't i lay this up okay luke and i tackled part four of the challenge which is game
[2320.76 --> 2329.64]  compatibility a little differently my way was a cop out i'm gonna own that i'm gonna own that okay sure
[2329.64 --> 2336.36]  my way was a bit of a cop out but other than you know trying a couple of games that i don't normally
[2336.36 --> 2343.24]  play you did try stuff and we also in your defense we also played a bunch of random games yes so i did
[2343.24 --> 2349.00]  that yeah like i just played games that i wanted to play the way that i normally would but luke actually
[2349.00 --> 2353.96]  really like nose to the grindstone massive props for this by the way thank you went through the
[2353.96 --> 2359.08]  most popular games on twitch sort of felt set did a sanity check on them and tried to come up with
[2359.08 --> 2366.60]  like 20 games that are the games people are playing and instead of relying on proton db to just say oh
[2366.60 --> 2370.04]  these are the most popular games or whatever else like really put some thought into okay what are the
[2370.04 --> 2376.84]  most popular games and then really set out to get them running so this video is going to end up kind of
[2376.84 --> 2381.96]  split up the way that i think part two we did it like that where we kind of talked about yeah so
[2381.96 --> 2385.64]  this one's going to be even more like that where i'm going to talk through okay well here's what i
[2385.64 --> 2392.44]  generally observed in my in my comings and goings just trying to live my life playing some video games
[2392.44 --> 2399.24]  sometimes and then luke's going to be like okay i tried this list of games and these are the specific
[2399.24 --> 2404.76]  problems that i ran into and this is this is this is what happened so like one big bomb that is in that
[2404.76 --> 2408.28]  video yeah but it's probably not coming out for like three weeks so people might forget by then
[2408.28 --> 2415.64]  anyways um but pro time db is super cool yes but we were trying to find a list of popular games that
[2415.64 --> 2421.64]  wasn't on steam that's why we use twitch and and yes we understand twitch is not a conclusive list of
[2421.64 --> 2425.72]  the most popular games what makes a good game for streaming does not necessarily mean that it's going
[2425.72 --> 2430.84]  to be super popular with the community but the top 20 games at least at the time that i checked
[2430.84 --> 2439.24]  on steam were very big name games that i know a lot of people play 50 percent exactly are not on steam
[2440.28 --> 2446.44]  yeah 50 of those top 20 games one of them was rocket league which i'm not counting as on steam
[2446.44 --> 2453.32]  because you cannot buy it anymore yes yeah yeah so i that's a lot that was honestly more than i expected
[2453.32 --> 2459.96]  it used to be like i mean i was i was looking at valves at valves goal right of having 100 of the
[2459.96 --> 2466.68]  steam library playable on the steam deck when they ship it and i was like wow that's cool and that's
[2466.68 --> 2473.00]  a lot of games that could keep you busy for multiple lifetimes yeah realistically it really could but when
[2473.00 --> 2477.88]  it comes to the games that other people are playing when we talk about the social aspect of gaming
[2477.88 --> 2485.48]  sharing experiences right like there's a reason that when eternals comes out right you don't want to be
[2485.48 --> 2488.84]  the only person in your friend group that didn't go see it right away maybe you don't even care
[2488.84 --> 2492.92]  about that movie that much but you want to know what everybody else is about it and stuff you want
[2492.92 --> 2498.84]  to know what everybody else is talking about when when someone when some your favorite gaming creator
[2498.84 --> 2505.08]  makes a video that's full of inside references or jokes about the battlefield 2042 beta you want to
[2505.08 --> 2510.36]  get the joke right yeah and so that's one of the things that's really challenging as much as you could
[2510.36 --> 2516.36]  play games for multiple lifetimes just within the steam library and if valve does get that going that's
[2516.36 --> 2524.68]  freaking awesome when it comes to being a part of gaming culture it's not the whole answer there's
[2524.68 --> 2534.76]  more to it than that so okay how'd compatibility go with your 20 games oh boy i think i think we might
[2534.76 --> 2542.68]  get into spoiler territory um it wasn't probably as good as a lot of people would think one one problem
[2542.68 --> 2551.56]  that you have when you get off of steam um is that the launchers are kind of trash in my experience
[2551.56 --> 2558.36]  universally bad yeah like it's it's rough i had one time my computer was just straight up lagging out and
[2558.36 --> 2563.00]  i couldn't figure out what was going on and then i was just closing random things one by one and then
[2563.00 --> 2569.00]  like assessing to try to figure out what was lagging out it was the epic games launcher a lot of different
[2569.00 --> 2572.20]  launchers have an issue where they just force themselves got a fast ssd
[2574.84 --> 2578.44]  um a lot of launchers have an issue where they force themselves to front for no apparent reason
[2578.44 --> 2582.36]  the blizzard launcher for me elements just won't load until i mouse over them
[2583.80 --> 2589.96]  a lot of them require not a lot of them at least one i believe to require at least for me
[2590.76 --> 2593.96]  that's one of the issues talking about linux stuff is there's so it's just like
[2593.96 --> 2598.76]  different fragmented ways you can run things that like who knows maybe it isn't for someone else but at
[2598.76 --> 2602.60]  least for me there's there's at least one or two launchers that if they update just need a complete
[2602.60 --> 2610.04]  new reinstall which is just annoying um steam yeah steam runs great and mostly mostly yeah there are
[2610.04 --> 2615.48]  some issues i mean we had that issue with remote play where if i if i right clicked your username
[2615.48 --> 2622.12]  and invited you that way it worked but if i got the link and copied it to you which is supposed to
[2622.12 --> 2627.24]  work that did not work this this is another one of the issues too though is that like these things
[2627.24 --> 2634.44]  ah and i hope people understand that we both do understand this is these things obviously also
[2634.44 --> 2639.64]  have issues on windows oh yeah windows is a piece of garbage yeah we get it yeah if anything this
[2639.64 --> 2646.60]  challenge you know what maybe that's what we should do maybe part four is not the end so i was talking
[2646.60 --> 2652.52]  to james about this today and i think we should have a part five where we actually get like uh like a
[2652.52 --> 2660.28]  crew of linux evangelists we pull in we get we grab anthony we pull in wendell from level one text we pull
[2660.28 --> 2666.92]  in like jason evangelo yeah someone like that right and we basically get them to sit and do like uh like
[2666.92 --> 2673.80]  uh like a vfx artists react kind of like a corridor crew style you know they don't we you don't see the
[2673.80 --> 2680.28]  entire series being watched by them right because that's boring but you might they might find certain
[2680.28 --> 2684.68]  clips and go through like they watch the whole challenge and kind of go yeah they were right
[2684.68 --> 2689.48]  about this they were totally wrong about this i think they overlooked how bad this is on windows
[2689.48 --> 2695.08]  and mac os or whatever it else whatever else it is and they they critique our journey through the
[2695.08 --> 2703.24]  challenge i think that would be great for a part five but then maybe part six part 69 you and i
[2703.24 --> 2713.00]  you and i do linux challenge part six we install windows but try to look at it through the eyes
[2713.00 --> 2720.84]  of a linux user or through the eyes of a fresh user and try to find try to catch ourselves with every
[2720.84 --> 2725.80]  workaround like there's there's some rough stuff there's some really rough there's been a bug in the
[2725.80 --> 2732.92]  windows installer where you if you have two drives right and you pick one of them there is a there is a
[2732.92 --> 2740.20]  roll an eight-sided die chance that the secondary drive will end up with your bootloader so if you
[2740.20 --> 2746.04]  pull out your secondary drive your main drive which has your entire operating system on it other than
[2746.04 --> 2752.76]  the bootloader won't boot anymore yeah and the process for fixing that is complete and utter black
[2752.76 --> 2758.68]  magic like it can be done but it is it is a freaking nightmare you know if i come out and i say look
[2758.68 --> 2764.04]  anything that you must do through command line is that if the average gamer has to do something
[2764.04 --> 2769.40]  through command line then you're done right like if i'm gonna say that then i can absolutely say to
[2769.40 --> 2777.96]  microsoft if any user ever has to do this you're done goofed you suck it's that simple there's also so bad
[2779.56 --> 2787.32]  windows update it's so bad it's so bad it's shocking like it's actually stunning tell me this okay
[2787.96 --> 2793.40]  for all the technological marvel that windows is like let's not pretend it isn't sure yeah it's an
[2793.40 --> 2797.80]  amazing piece of software the fact that it works as well as it did does is a bloody miracle when you
[2797.80 --> 2805.64]  consider the forward and backward compatibility of the platform it's amazing how could it possibly be
[2806.44 --> 2815.40]  how could it possibly be that when i click check for updates that is not instantaneous yeah how could you
[2815.40 --> 2822.76]  possibly not know what the updates on my system are and what the updates on your cloud server are it
[2822.76 --> 2830.92]  takes like in and milliseconds it takes a actually awkward amount of time it really does i'm sitting
[2830.92 --> 2836.04]  there sometimes going like like really like i've i've actually never had to check for updates on mint
[2836.04 --> 2843.96]  mint just has this very nice little notification with a very tiny little uh dot that'll tell me if there's
[2843.96 --> 2849.56]  new ones and if i feel like it i'll download and install them and it's never a problem i always know
[2849.56 --> 2854.20]  if they're there windows i have to manually check or if it's just or it's just gonna try to like restart
[2854.20 --> 2863.48]  and bork all my stuff at random times it's just like oh man so frustrating it's just baffling um so
[2863.48 --> 2869.64]  so yeah what do you think of that we we do like we try to go fresh eyes maybe i'll go windows 11.
[2869.64 --> 2874.04]  okay because like okay here's something here's something that frustrated me on linux um for
[2874.04 --> 2881.08]  whatever reason um when so open vpn okay yeah so sorry someone in chat just said it took 11 seconds
[2881.08 --> 2887.80]  right now for them to find their windows updates how is that how is that even possible sorry okay keep
[2887.80 --> 2898.36]  going it's how is it possible you know um so right so uh oh what was i saying oh yeah open vpn so open vpn
[2898.36 --> 2906.20]  in uh manjaro linux is as simple as right clicking on your like network connection and being like oh
[2906.20 --> 2911.48]  i want to use open vpn now i didn't actually manage to get it working i spent a grand total of 15 seconds
[2911.48 --> 2916.60]  troubleshooting it okay so the problem was that it wanted a pre-shared key and a passphrase or something
[2916.60 --> 2922.60]  like that and i was like huh um normally when i connect to this i only use a username and password
[2922.60 --> 2929.64]  and that's not what this is so i guess i and it involved like going into our rpf sense box and like
[2929.64 --> 2936.36]  okay exporting a new thing or something i just i was like ah you know what i i i'm like nine days from
[2936.36 --> 2942.12]  the end of the challenge i'm gonna parse second to my work machine i don't even care sorry um so i i
[2942.12 --> 2948.12]  didn't bother but if i if i was used to that workflow what i can tell is that it would be super simple to
[2948.12 --> 2954.92]  quickly connect authenticate and connect to an open vpn connection which is which is awesome on windows
[2954.92 --> 2961.40]  it's like kind of a pain in the ass it kind of sucks you have to download this like secondary
[2961.40 --> 2969.32]  application and when you connect to it um i've got this weird issue with windows explorer where if i
[2970.04 --> 2976.12]  don't wait for the connection to completely finish and i try to access a network share on the remote
[2976.12 --> 2984.12]  network yeah i will have to disconnect close open vpn open it again sometimes i have to do a full
[2984.12 --> 2990.92]  dance where i have to restart explorer.exe then i have to open openvpn connect wait patiently and then
[2990.92 --> 2995.80]  do it again because just just reconnecting or just opening a new explorer window will not work it will just
[2995.80 --> 3005.96]  not load like there are problems with windows tried to play forza okay we're back to problems
[3005.96 --> 3013.88]  with linux now no oh yeah actually this is like have you installed windows already uh i'm technically
[3013.88 --> 3018.60]  done the challenge so i didn't install windows because i just had both drives in got it okay so
[3018.60 --> 3023.24]  i just booted when i was literally i pulled my windows drive out so i wouldn't be tempted i was
[3023.24 --> 3028.20]  i was back on that's funny i also didn't want to deal with dual booting i was like i'm not gonna learn
[3028.20 --> 3033.00]  grub oh i'm sorry i just will not i ended up i thought i was gonna have to mess with it i didn't have to
[3033.00 --> 3038.52]  do anything it just worked perfectly right out of the box yay um i wanted to play forza so i booted
[3038.52 --> 3043.48]  into windows that's pretty much all i actually used it for i was back on linux literally today
[3043.48 --> 3047.96]  yeah so whatever um but i'm technically done the challenge so i can do that um
[3049.48 --> 3055.08]  funnily enough i ended up reading a tweet after i was done playing forza that someone got forza working
[3055.08 --> 3065.72]  on linux it it took them five days which is like amazing and also terrible yeah um but but it was
[3065.72 --> 3073.00]  such a pain to try to play with other people because microsoft's weird obfuscated stuff these
[3073.00 --> 3080.20]  days a lot of the like user panels and ways things work are are actually just really really odd and this
[3080.20 --> 3086.04]  is coming from someone who has used windows forever yeah trying to multiplayer with people in forza is
[3086.04 --> 3091.16]  really difficult and we ended up all needing to like download additional applications and all this
[3091.16 --> 3095.56]  kind of stuff like it was it was a nightmare did i talk about how horrible it was playing minecraft
[3095.56 --> 3099.56]  dungeons with my kids really fun game but right because i had to create microsoft accounts for them
[3099.56 --> 3106.04]  but they're like junior accounts and even their parent was not automatically enabled to play online
[3106.04 --> 3111.40]  games with them so i had to go and navigate it took me like two hours to get it all going between
[3111.40 --> 3116.28]  buying the game for all my kids and setting up the accounts and setting up the parental things because
[3116.28 --> 3121.08]  it's you have to there's two different things first i had to make it so that we could actually be
[3121.08 --> 3127.00]  friends then we were friends but like the button just wasn't there so i had to make it so that and
[3127.00 --> 3130.92]  there's ways that microsoft could absolutely make that experience way better right like they could have
[3130.92 --> 3135.48]  the online button and then kind of like it works on android if my kids want to install an app
[3135.48 --> 3140.84]  it'll just send me a notification i'll be like yes yeah there is no reason why minecraft dungeons
[3140.84 --> 3147.00]  couldn't just if they go to play online have a a button that they ask for permission and then i
[3147.00 --> 3151.40]  could i could accept i could accept it on a case-by-case basis if i didn't want them on all the time
[3151.40 --> 3155.56]  or i could say okay yes all the time or whatever like there's no reason that those systems can't be
[3155.56 --> 3161.24]  better and i've got someone here is uh let me have a look at this uh jamie says i feel like the
[3161.24 --> 3165.40]  problem with windows is being exaggerated a bit well for sure but the problems with everything are
[3165.40 --> 3171.24]  exaggerated a bit i don't even necessarily just i don't even necessarily agree i should say actually
[3171.24 --> 3175.64]  yeah that's fair i don't think it's being exaggerated this there's a lot of stuff on windows that is
[3175.64 --> 3179.72]  really straightforward because it's been really straightforward for 10 years but there's a lot
[3179.72 --> 3184.36]  of stuff with windows where they're trying to like any time microsoft has tried to get into the
[3184.36 --> 3188.68]  gaming space on pc which i know is like kind of weird to say because they made direct x but you know
[3188.68 --> 3195.48]  what i mean the the more like consumer usage side of the gaming space it's been really bad yeah and
[3195.48 --> 3202.52]  honestly just stop trying to remake the wheel forza is a fantastic game been having tons of fun the worst
[3202.52 --> 3206.60]  part was trying to play with other people which is really weird because like a theme of the game is
[3206.60 --> 3212.12]  like oh we're a family we're a community let's all like race together i can't play with your friends
[3212.12 --> 3220.20]  um when i bought it on steam it it it feels like they're they're they're like literally five plus
[3220.20 --> 3226.76]  years behind on a lot of stuff and i i really appreciate that they're trying to do this like
[3226.76 --> 3232.20]  cross-platform thing so you can own a game for computer or or own a game for console and play it on
[3232.20 --> 3239.40]  both that's very cool either don't get your little grubby little hands on like the friends list and
[3239.40 --> 3246.76]  stuff that make the experience really bad yeah or just do it right i know you can yeah i know you're
[3246.76 --> 3251.96]  capable you're a multi-billion dollar company i'm sure you can figure it out yes i shouldn't
[3251.96 --> 3257.96]  i have the xbox app i shouldn't have to download the xbox game bar in order to invite my friends to
[3257.96 --> 3265.96]  games stop it also i couldn't even log into the game at first oh look i've had that issue before too
[3265.96 --> 3270.12]  where you literally cannot do anything because their authentication servers down microsoft account
[3270.12 --> 3275.16]  and you're stuck staring at it like screen like the the car going right i had to go into some like
[3275.16 --> 3279.64]  weird credential manager and like delete a bunch of stuff and then eventually i had to say sign in
[3279.64 --> 3286.04]  with windows hello which i don't have set up and then it just worked because it's like bugged out like
[3286.04 --> 3293.56]  oh man sure what a terrible experience anyways sure uh we should probably talk about the amd amd data center
[3293.56 --> 3299.48]  tech sure so genoa and bergamo bergamo i'm sorry i don't know how to pronounce that uh genoa is going
[3299.48 --> 3309.16]  to have up to 96 zen 4 cores and bergamo i'm so sorry i'm butchering this uh up to 128 zen 4c cores so
[3309.16 --> 3316.04]  those are cloud optimized ones where the idea here is that amd is going after some of these arm-based
[3316.04 --> 3321.48]  chips that companies like amazon are building for themselves and kind of going whoa whoa whoa hold on a
[3321.48 --> 3328.76]  second x86 ain't cooked yet ladies and gentlemen i am pretty excited to see how these perform and if
[3328.76 --> 3336.36]  they end up shaking things up uh genoa is set for 2022 with bergamo late 2022 or early 2023 they'll both
[3336.36 --> 3347.56]  feature ddr5 pcie gen 5 among other things and uh one other big highlight is the amd instinct mi 250
[3347.56 --> 3353.72]  accelerator card pretty cool blah blah blah they didn't show ai benchmarks that's kind of suspicious
[3353.72 --> 3359.88]  says nicholas ploof who prepared this for us and i think that's pretty much it because i have to go
[3359.88 --> 3366.92]  pretty soon but we said we'd talk about microsoft releases se products so what is this i don't know
[3367.72 --> 3373.96]  on wednesday microsoft announced two products taking aim at chrome os's incursion in elementary
[3373.96 --> 3381.80]  schools surface laptop se and windows 11 se it's gonna be a fight yeah gonna be a fight yeah what
[3381.80 --> 3391.00]  does se even stand for second edition i don't think so because it's like it's like an educational product
[3391.00 --> 3399.16]  thing the notes don't have it all right uh i don't want to talk about the pinch to zoom cordial
[3399.16 --> 3403.40]  law thing i just don't want to touch that with a 10 foot pole yep sounds good let's uh let's jump
[3403.40 --> 3408.12]  over to lttstore.com because we've got something pretty cool for you guys this is a product that
[3408.12 --> 3417.40]  has been in the works for like a year um it's the party shirt oh yeah yeah it's kind of cool
[3417.40 --> 3427.72]  edition and it's super comfortable check it out it's got little gpus and cpus and ssds and ram
[3427.72 --> 3433.00]  sticks and power supplies and fans on it i genuinely think this is really cool i like it too because
[3433.00 --> 3440.76]  it especially like it it looks pretty pro you know yep i love it and a lot of people like showing off
[3440.76 --> 3448.68]  their like guys suits are pretty you know cookie cutter a lot of the time yeah but with the little
[3448.68 --> 3453.48]  pattern on your shirt and the pattern on your tie you can often show off a little bit of personality
[3453.48 --> 3461.56]  exactly exactly yeah it's cool um also oh this is fun the uh latest edition of the newsletter is
[3461.56 --> 3466.76]  out and kyle who you actually just saw wearing the party shirt with his beautiful smile and long hair
[3466.76 --> 3473.08]  um was our was our kind of uh wrote our feature story today um not everything our team works on
[3473.08 --> 3476.44]  is directly related to making something you might hold in your hands one day there's a lot of testing
[3476.44 --> 3481.08]  analysis that goes on behind the scenes kyle's omni-directional speaker is a perfect example
[3481.08 --> 3485.64]  uh so regular viewers of short circuit would know that when we built the new set uh we had this
[3486.60 --> 3493.96]  awful echo and reverberation um this can be a huge headache to fix but in this case the fix was
[3493.96 --> 3499.56]  simple just move the microphone the way we figured this out science look at this look at this look at
[3499.56 --> 3505.64]  this speaker oh that's sweet so you can buy these you can buy these pre-done but kyle was like no f that
[3505.64 --> 3511.08]  that's expensive and built one um it's called the death star speaker and it has one function to make
[3511.08 --> 3515.00]  noise in all directions which is kind of the opposite of what the death star did but you know
[3515.00 --> 3521.48]  whatever minor details um so it's a dodecahedron um there's an instructables on how you can how you can
[3521.48 --> 3527.88]  build this um after a bunch of hours 3d printing a day in the workshop and some jank out came a working
[3527.88 --> 3532.84]  omni-directional sound maker and combining this with a calibrated usb microphone and an open source
[3532.84 --> 3539.24]  software package called ru we can take relatively accurate acoustic readings so we used this to fix
[3539.24 --> 3547.00]  the reverb in the short circuit set we also used it and you can see the um the graph from the ltt video
[3547.00 --> 3554.12]  acoustically treating the workshop to pretty much fix the awful audio in the workshop and to quantify
[3554.12 --> 3559.96]  just how much we fixed it so he's got a bunch more details in here about how that works and oh by the
[3559.96 --> 3566.60]  way you know also we sell stuff hey that's a thing too but this is such a great example of what i want
[3566.60 --> 3572.04]  this newsletter to be so make sure you guys sign up over at ltdstore.com so you can uh you can check
[3572.04 --> 3579.64]  these out um we should we do need to do a few merch messages but i cannot stay for that long because
[3579.64 --> 3588.76]  otherwise i will get um low murdered um is this a page that i can share or no uh what if i do this
[3589.96 --> 3595.88]  uh i think that's okay unless there's a message on here that's bad oh yeah right let's not do that
[3595.88 --> 3600.36]  all right ryan what's the story or reason behind the original names for your servers where did the
[3600.36 --> 3607.08]  name wanak server come from uh wanak is a town i grew up in there you go uh noah love the merch my
[3607.08 --> 3611.00]  manager was on everyone's behinds but not having branded jackets at work but didn't bat an eye at my
[3611.00 --> 3615.96]  stealth hoodie keep up the great work that's the goal dude is the point that's why it's called the
[3615.96 --> 3622.76]  stealth hoodie you can rep ltc without you know causing a scene um also we actually have it in
[3622.76 --> 3629.16]  stock on like wan hoodie so please please settle please settle for stealth hoodie uh aiden what video
[3629.16 --> 3633.56]  did you want to recreate or redo from the older days now that you have a larger team and more resources oh
[3633.56 --> 3642.36]  man uh well here's one that we're actually working on uh anthony wrote and i heavily contributed to a
[3642.36 --> 3648.76]  video called the last pc build guide you will ever need and basically it doesn't lay out a list of
[3648.76 --> 3658.20]  parts at all what it does is it lays out foundational principles for choosing your parts lays out
[3658.20 --> 3664.36]  foundational principles for how to research and lays out foundational principles for how to build a pc
[3664.36 --> 3672.44]  with all the sort of icky picky little details in there but not assuming the presence or absence of
[3672.44 --> 3681.08]  any of them right it is going to probably be a two to two and a half hour video but it will be the
[3681.08 --> 3686.20]  last pc build guide you ever need that's pretty cool we talked through just everything what are
[3686.20 --> 3691.00]  form factors oh you know what i gotta i gotta ping him we didn't talk about power supply form factors
[3691.00 --> 3699.32]  what about a truly successful whole room water cooling um uh okay so that that's not what this
[3699.32 --> 3704.60]  is hold on one sec i need to do this we need to include a chunk about power supply form factors in the
[3704.60 --> 3710.44]  last guide you'll ever need video to be clear i have i'm not referencing the last guy do you ever need
[3710.44 --> 3718.20]  i'm talking about the original question uh yes okay how's what oh my goodness i swear this used to
[3718.20 --> 3725.64]  be i'm gonna try to get through some super chats okay i'm done um no but we have some new capabilities
[3725.64 --> 3731.16]  that might make it so we could do something even better oh alex and brian the electrician worked on
[3731.16 --> 3739.40]  a phase change cooler that we think could be daily drivable oh at like minus 20 degrees celsius oh which
[3739.40 --> 3744.60]  is pretty interesting and one of the other ways we're considering using it is a chilled box so you don't
[3744.60 --> 3750.12]  have to deal with condensation the crazy thing about custom liquid cooling is that it can actually
[3750.12 --> 3755.96]  cost as much as an air conditioner it doesn't cost anything to run on an ongoing basis but with an
[3755.96 --> 3762.76]  air conditioned like chilled computer case like it's like a it's like a fridge on steroids right you can't
[3762.76 --> 3766.04]  build a computer in a fridge because the compressor can't handle that kind of heat output it's not
[3766.04 --> 3771.96]  designed for it not just the compressor but the um uh the condenser it's just it can't handle it right
[3771.96 --> 3775.96]  um it's not designed for that kind of heat outlet it's designed to keep something cold not make
[3775.96 --> 3783.00]  something that is heating generating heat cold so this is that but on steroids um so that's i mean
[3783.00 --> 3788.36]  that's that's an idea that's something yeah um let's move on let's move on this is the perfect gift for
[3788.36 --> 3795.64]  my girlfriend says vittoro hey fantastic um dimitri says give anthony his own linux channel already i mean
[3795.64 --> 3800.44]  we can just make more linux content on the other channels no promises there paul says can luke model
[3800.44 --> 3804.44]  more shirts you think he's closest to my height okay that depends he'll have to work through that
[3804.44 --> 3812.68]  with um uh hoffman who takes all those pictures uh barry hey thanks for giving me something to look
[3812.68 --> 3820.84]  forward to hey thanks barry uh mitro asks who are your user experience rants directed at distros are
[3820.84 --> 3825.64]  built by users the way they like it you personally did not contribute why do you think you have the right
[3825.64 --> 3830.76]  to tell other users that they are wrong those who don't give back don't have a say hey dimitro you
[3830.76 --> 3838.68]  lost the game sorry bro but thanks for ordering a stealth hoodie okay i'm sorry i'll try that again
[3839.72 --> 3846.52]  as a user you are allowed to talk about the user experience that is all the credentials that you need
[3846.52 --> 3853.88]  and in fact a lot of the time creators can end up too close to a project to properly appreciate the user
[3853.88 --> 3861.40]  experience of someone who didn't create it that is one of the core problems that linux suffers from
[3863.32 --> 3869.96]  is that the users are the developers and so it's really hard for them to know how to design for a
[3869.96 --> 3880.76]  more general user that's who i am feeling like i i have the right to talk about the user experience i'm a user
[3880.76 --> 3888.52]  um arvin hey could you add an option to switch between metric and imperial and ltd store is that
[3888.52 --> 3896.28]  something we're looking at at all um we haven't yet but maybe at some point could yeah um anonymous
[3896.28 --> 3899.48]  been following along with the linux challenge and i'm not going to turn back for a good while
[3899.48 --> 3905.32]  went with endeavor os that's super cool nice i've heard good things uh techie tech quickie calendar is
[3905.32 --> 3911.48]  not coming for 2022 but we'll probably do one for 2023 basically it's designed but we um didn't hit
[3911.48 --> 3923.40]  the printing cutoff whoops um any updates on the hammer asks william e uh no actually and i checked
[3923.40 --> 3931.00]  literally within the last week thanks david r okay i'm sorry i can't do more merch messages if luke wants
[3931.00 --> 3936.12]  to stay and do some i really do have to go or i will get murdered by my wife i can do then okay
[3936.12 --> 3942.68]  are you able to lock up uh yeah okay it's just been a long time call me if you need any help okay sweet
[3942.68 --> 3950.44]  okay bye everyone bye i'm staying right you know how to like uh i think so okay can you turn that towards
[3950.44 --> 3957.48]  me just hit intro auto to run the thing and then this to do the thing oh just like manually move myself
[3957.48 --> 3965.24]  over there but you have to stop the youtube thing first okay um hold on are they are we off my page
[3965.24 --> 3970.92]  yeah so you have to press this and stream first before killing and then that okay okay bye
[3972.60 --> 3979.16]  you're all mine now okay let's uh yeah let's go through some things
[3981.32 --> 3987.00]  jonathan q thank you so much for all the tips and knowledge you helped me go from someone building a pc
[3987.00 --> 3991.32]  to someone intelligently building pcs for myself friends and family your whole team is amazing
[3991.32 --> 3995.64]  keep up the amazing work it's probably more directed at linus but i appreciate it thank you very much
[3995.64 --> 4005.56]  uh eric you hi linus haha get wrecked the backpack looks great but there are sorely few large messenger
[4005.56 --> 4014.28]  style tech bags any chance you could make my next messenger bag um that's more of a question for nick by the
[4014.28 --> 4022.92]  way um if you guys have like store requests and stuff like that honestly um i straight up don't
[4022.92 --> 4027.80]  remember his handle i'm pretty sure it's nick lmg um i don't exactly memorize people's twitter handles
[4028.36 --> 4036.12]  um but nick runs the store like let's let's not get it twisted um yeah nick lmg so you're way better off
[4036.12 --> 4041.80]  if you just reach out to nick and to be completely honest that even includes store features like you want
[4041.80 --> 4047.64]  that like imperial metric thing reach out to nick um nick is the the ultimate deciding factor for
[4047.64 --> 4054.68]  things that happen on the store whether it's merch or uh features because he will essentially like tell
[4054.68 --> 4063.56]  me and then i'll tell conrad and then conrad will do it um so yeah just do it that way 15 minute float
[4063.56 --> 4070.28]  plane ad yeah yeah subscribe to float point uh i inserted uh i inserted a little float plane call out in
[4070.28 --> 4077.72]  in the linux video it was fun uh moving on though walter e thank you for your content you should get
[4077.72 --> 4083.40]  slash consult with an audio engineer yeah i don't think we should get one um doing a consult could
[4083.40 --> 4089.40]  be pretty interesting there are many things we i'm an audio engineer could work on especially your new
[4089.40 --> 4093.32]  audio booth yeah i mean if we're going to build an audio booth we would consult with someone who knows
[4093.32 --> 4101.48]  what they're doing um e and l i've been a viewer for around eight years around the time that i started
[4101.48 --> 4106.04]  my career in tech support all the work you guys have done uh over the years providing interesting and
[4106.04 --> 4111.00]  educational content around tech if your team ever does anything australia i'll be there heck yeah
[4113.88 --> 4120.44]  ben m bought some underwear and a water bottle and said finally underwear without holes there you go
[4120.44 --> 4127.08]  you'll you'll enjoy them i i pretty much exclusively wear ltd underwear these days i'm not kidding i'm
[4127.08 --> 4135.32]  wearing them right now um and it's they're great james bought an ltd hoodie said ltd should team with g4
[4135.32 --> 4142.60]  for something that could be interesting jonas says greetings from germany joseph says hydration check
[4142.60 --> 4148.12]  long time watcher glad to have finally uh been able to catch one of these live i am a hydro homie
[4148.12 --> 4153.72]  um but that's linus's water bottle not mine and code's a thing so i'm not going to partake
[4153.72 --> 4159.32]  there's also other reasons to not partake but whatever um i forgot my water bottle but yeah i'm
[4159.32 --> 4166.20]  gonna i'm gonna glug up when i get home michael greetings from winter peg man it's cold yeah yeah i
[4166.20 --> 4171.72]  got some some relatives over there sure is it's not nearly as cold over here i actually wish it was colder
[4171.72 --> 4180.68]  over here okay um i think there's a video software computer adam c do you think there's value in doing
[4180.68 --> 4186.84]  a video of a software company tour probably not um you could go over to different departments like sales
[4186.84 --> 4195.72]  oh customer service oh dev ops probably actually interesting and talking about things like ados
[4195.72 --> 4204.76]  uh and infrastructure my company uh benevity uses our tech to help donating to charity to help make
[4204.76 --> 4209.48]  donating to charity easier and more efficient that's good nice i'm happy you guys do that
[4211.16 --> 4219.00]  um nathan says hey linus ha ha never gonna get old uh love the show you guys literally got me through
[4219.00 --> 4225.16]  college would y'all be interested in doing more networking level content probably not at a super high level
[4225.16 --> 4232.68]  um just saying but maybe they would i don't know not my team
[4234.28 --> 4242.84]  uh alexander l at work right now as a sound designer on a musical but hope to catch this in the vaud keep
[4242.84 --> 4249.72]  up the good work and tell luke he's a cutie i will uh he says thank you uh robert m hello and welcome to
[4249.72 --> 4257.72]  the wan show have any have a listen now anything tech news you think of can be found we've got mountains
[4257.72 --> 4265.08]  of tech news some better some worse if okay i get it okay it's the the internet song
[4267.64 --> 4269.96]  i don't know if i can sing along with it well enough though
[4269.96 --> 4277.80]  yeah i'm not good enough to do that but very clever moving on
[4279.48 --> 4290.52]  scrapyard wars anytime soon no if not scrapyard wars if not scalper yard wars maybe probably not
[4290.52 --> 4297.56]  that's the series yeah it's a little tried at this point um as much as uh scrapyard wars is is my baby
[4297.56 --> 4304.84]  um we've we've done the format a lot uh i could i could see it maybe coming back there's there's
[4304.84 --> 4311.32]  still a few more things the last one was a little rough um there's still a few more things we could do
[4311.32 --> 4319.24]  it takes a lot of people it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of editing um and they're not quite
[4319.24 --> 4325.64]  performing as well as they used to because the it's a little bit tired of a formula to be completely honest
[4325.64 --> 4331.96]  um as much as it hurts to say because i love scrapyard wars as well um right now is a really hard
[4331.96 --> 4338.04]  time for it and linus and i are difficult people to use for it i might actually be easier these days
[4338.04 --> 4344.68]  because i feel like less people probably know me now um but linus is so freaking recognizable that
[4344.68 --> 4351.72]  it's it's genuinely very difficult to to do scrapyard wars um i don't know if i could say honestly
[4351.72 --> 4355.32]  because it's not like you'd be intentionally cheating but like people are going to treat
[4355.32 --> 4361.72]  you better if they if they recognize you from the interwebs or worse but usually better um devon l
[4364.92 --> 4370.36]  got closure last show on bad time bad channel channel you'd been saying bat time forever luke
[4370.36 --> 4375.80]  said bad time once linus said it was wrong later linus says bad time luke called him out for it and
[4375.80 --> 4381.72]  last denied it was ever bat time luke was right i don't remember any of that but i'll take it i'll
[4381.72 --> 4389.56]  take the w um miguel i love to wear fun shirts to work on fridays so i can't wait to add this to my
[4389.56 --> 4396.76]  collection oh he got the party shirt nice okay thanks for everything you do for lmg uh thanks for
[4396.76 --> 4402.68]  everything you and lmg do there we go sorry dyslexia um you sparked my love for tech three years ago and
[4402.68 --> 4410.20]  now i have a job in it and love it fantastic josh looking at the spreadsheet from the hdmi video
[4410.20 --> 4417.00]  you guys only tested six 15 foot cables all from monoprice based on this information uh you guys are
[4417.00 --> 4423.64]  saying that using a passive cable over 10 feet is asking for trouble is there and then i think they
[4423.64 --> 4428.60]  pressed enter on accident oh no there's a character cap
[4428.60 --> 4433.08]  a comrade does it just let them keep typing
[4437.16 --> 4439.32]  i hope that's not the case i don't think that's the case
[4441.48 --> 4448.36]  they just sort of stopped mid-sentence so i'm just gonna move on uh morgan linus you inspired me to
[4448.36 --> 4453.64]  become a tech youtuber and try to get out of my crappy job to thank you i solved your issue with
[4453.64 --> 4458.28]  wireless keyboards in a what search song okay cool
[4460.68 --> 4468.44]  uh dim dimitro oh i hope i'm saying that right binaries for linux are dynamically compiled so there
[4468.44 --> 4475.64]  can't be just can't be just linux binary they're separate for each distro there isn't even a choice
[4475.64 --> 4483.64]  you must pick a distro with a higher user base ubuntu or experience pain saying you have to
[4485.56 --> 4490.36]  so this is this is something i've i've gathered a lot more feels on that aren't actually gonna be
[4490.36 --> 4496.52]  able to make it into the videos because honestly part four linux part four is massive just my portion
[4496.52 --> 4502.84]  of linux part four is honestly about the length of a lot of videos that i used to make um and linus has a
[4502.84 --> 4508.36]  just as long or potentially even longer portion of that video um and these types of thoughts aren't in
[4508.36 --> 4515.32]  it um but i i disagree i even disagree i disagree with so many different points of this i even disagree
[4515.32 --> 4521.64]  with the idea of experiencing pain uh because i don't think it's all pain um i think an extremely
[4521.64 --> 4529.08]  valid way to experience linux is with no prior experience whatsoever dive directly into arch and get owned
[4529.08 --> 4538.36]  and i don't necessarily think that's painful i think i think like i wish linux is actually here
[4538.36 --> 4544.04]  because this is what i wanted to talk about with linux today but we ran out of time um there's this
[4544.04 --> 4551.16]  conception that i i think has been pushed forward on wan to some degree which is where everything has to be
[4552.44 --> 4557.40]  user friendly from a general user standpoint and i don't agree with that we have we have talked about
[4557.40 --> 4564.60]  this and i have brought this up in the past there can be hyper enthusiast versions and nerfing those to
[4564.60 --> 4573.56]  make them more normie friendly is not a good thing especially when you're on a platform that has
[4575.40 --> 4583.96]  such a breadth of of flavors right so for me i want a game on it i i honestly just don't really
[4583.96 --> 4589.32]  want my operating system to get in my way i have a lot of things to to get done um i'm either like
[4589.32 --> 4593.56]  diving into a game with my friends or diving into work and if i'm not honestly i probably just want
[4593.56 --> 4597.00]  to hang out with my birds uh messing with my operating system was something that i used to do a
[4597.00 --> 4601.64]  ton when i was growing up and it's not really something i do that much anymore so mint is great
[4601.64 --> 4606.60]  for me ubuntu would probably also be great for me i'm just not a huge fan of gnome 3 i like cinnamon's
[4607.24 --> 4616.12]  take on gnome 2 i'm very happy with mint things are good um but if i was trying to learn linux like
[4616.84 --> 4624.12]  really learn it my approach would probably be to start with one of these advanced user distros like
[4624.12 --> 4629.72]  potentially arch and throw myself in the fire and it wouldn't be pain it would be effective learning
[4630.52 --> 4636.04]  because you're you're forcing yourself to to really absorb this stuff and really learn it deeply and
[4636.04 --> 4643.48]  thoroughly and that's good that can be very good and honestly has a high amount of potential to make
[4643.48 --> 4649.08]  future actual pain not as bad because you have a deeper and more proper understanding of what you're
[4649.08 --> 4656.92]  using uh one of my infrastructure guys at floatplane uh aj essentially said that one of the best ways to
[4656.92 --> 4664.52]  to start with linux would be to start without a gui just um start with a command line only and he's
[4664.52 --> 4670.28]  not when i first read that i was like what the heck but it's aj so i had to like think about it more
[4670.28 --> 4674.52]  because he's a really smart dude so i thought about it more and was like you know what in a lot of ways
[4674.52 --> 4681.72]  yeah because you're you're learning the the like hyper power user way to do this thing and that makes a lot of sense
[4681.72 --> 4690.20]  so yeah i don't agree with your your point entirely anyways that was an extremely long answer i'm gonna
[4690.20 --> 4697.80]  move forward um shanae my husband is watching right now uh i think he looked you more than me
[4698.60 --> 4705.88]  get wrecked your husband is mine now uh michael youtube moderation is trash yep
[4705.88 --> 4714.36]  lawrence these ltt cable ties are so much more useful than just for the inside of a computer case
[4714.36 --> 4719.56]  that's true i just keep finding more and more uses for them this is my third batch of 20 looking
[4719.56 --> 4722.12]  forward to more gaming on linux videos heck yeah
[4725.88 --> 4732.36]  um there's no such thing as more people working together on a single goal in open source software
[4732.36 --> 4738.12]  decentralization is the key because people disagree i would just quit and pick another hobby rather than
[4738.12 --> 4741.40]  argue with someone okay
[4745.40 --> 4755.96]  bryson b anime voice actor bryson bogus confirmed linus fan hey nice uh built a mini itx pc themed after
[4755.96 --> 4764.44]  my character show you oh my i'm so sorry but i'm gonna try show you henata from haikyu
[4768.60 --> 4778.12]  i have no idea sorry if i hurt people there uh david linus thank you so much uh i have never got any
[4778.12 --> 4783.64]  other youtube or streamer merch but i got y'all's desk pad very good quality i hope this shirt will also be
[4783.64 --> 4789.56]  good quality it will be i can pretty much guarantee it and if it's not contact support um chat please
[4789.56 --> 4792.44]  buy the merch to help support them ltdstore.com heck yeah
[4797.32 --> 4802.60]  luke n nice name by the way bruh uh grabbing the stormtrooper bottle so i don't have to worry about
[4802.60 --> 4807.72]  hitting anything with it very nice also star wars fan i like it oh another one from dimitro
[4807.72 --> 4814.36]  uh who do your user rants directed at distros are built by ah this is the one that um
[4815.80 --> 4821.96]  line is already addressed alas day i've no i'm gonna pause alas to dare hopefully i'm saying your
[4821.96 --> 4828.36]  name correctly and address this again i find the linux community is a difficult thing to address because
[4828.36 --> 4834.36]  any community that has the any community that anyone at any time can claim to be a be a part of
[4834.36 --> 4840.76]  based on nothing is is gonna have a lot of different voices and they're not all gonna agree
[4840.76 --> 4843.96]  with each other and they're gonna react to things different ways and all that kind of stuff so i have
[4843.96 --> 4851.72]  to be careful when i say the linux community but i find there's a lot of personal hurt defensiveness
[4851.72 --> 4859.24]  when any criticisms are sent towards linux stuff in general or the linux community in general
[4859.24 --> 4866.68]  what i hope that people understand is we were genuinely trying to give this a very good shot
[4866.68 --> 4873.88]  and there was i i think the conclusions and stuff are going to be more positive than you guys necessarily
[4873.88 --> 4879.64]  expect when we're sitting here on wan show we're coming off of like a day or a night or whatever of
[4879.64 --> 4885.48]  fighting with it and we're frustrated about various things but we this isn't the edited tailored version
[4885.48 --> 4891.32]  of our thoughts and stuff so so stick stick with it stick with it the conclusion is pretty strong
[4891.32 --> 4900.44]  okay we've shot part four i know i read it it's there um alas dare hopefully i'm saying this correctly
[4901.08 --> 4906.28]  please sign my bottle oh that's probably not gonna happen sorry along with the person who picked and
[4906.28 --> 4912.28]  shipped that'd be pretty cool um but this is yeah sorry uh love you guys don't ever change honesty and
[4912.28 --> 4921.88]  transparency there it is honest and transparent um uh benjamin thank you so much linus thank you for
[4921.88 --> 4926.60]  over seven years of entertainment and for giving me countless examples of how to just be a good person
[4926.60 --> 4934.76]  dang heck yeah cedric is that correct cedric cedric hello from province of quebec hashtag float plane
[4934.76 --> 4941.48]  home kind of true yeah peter s i've made 3k mining with my gaming hardware since you suggested on a wan
[4941.48 --> 4950.76]  thanks man ltd just pad rocks heck yeah sounds good i've got a buddy who has a 3090 he might even be
[4950.76 --> 4959.72]  watching right now i'm not sure um and he he games and he works from home um and he runs just a nice
[4959.72 --> 4963.40]  hash thing i'm not recommending nice hash be very clear i have no idea what i'm talking about don't
[4963.40 --> 4969.32]  listen to me uh but he runs i believe it's just a nice nice hash thing on his on his 3090 and he's made
[4969.32 --> 4976.60]  like a grand in the last like two and a half three months okay okay it's a thing
[4979.48 --> 4987.48]  anonymous says hey linus have you found a headphone amp for your hd 8 xx yet i have no idea i'm sorry
[4987.48 --> 4993.48]  i would recommend the okay sounds good the hi-fi m8 v2 just in case anyone was wondering
[4993.48 --> 5000.92]  philip thanks for all the years i've watched thank you for the quality of the stealth like the beanie
[5000.92 --> 5006.68]  being u.s air force they require our uniform to be black with black logos it's impossible to
[5006.68 --> 5011.88]  find quality like this but your stuff never disappoints thanks again i look forward to the
[5011.88 --> 5019.88]  backpack that's really interesting i never thought about that because there's not just okay so u.s air
[5019.88 --> 5025.88]  force requires black uniform with black logos so i i believe film sets also do and there's there's
[5025.88 --> 5029.96]  other industries that do as well that's that's pretty interesting i didn't realize that portion
[5029.96 --> 5035.80]  of the benefit of the stealth products on the store that's actually really cool uh jake j loving the
[5035.80 --> 5042.12]  content are we going to have an ltx 2022 i think they're trying i can't say officially i'm not literally
[5042.12 --> 5046.20]  not a part of that company but i think they're trying i think they're attempting to get ltx 2022 off the
[5046.20 --> 5049.56]  ground but covet makes things difficult we don't know if it's still going to be around then
[5049.88 --> 5053.88]  who knows has jake abandoned the minecraft server i don't think so i don't know
[5055.72 --> 5060.84]  uh loving the short clips on flow plane full plane gang heck yeah um
[5062.84 --> 5069.88]  cool will legit do anything in the world to have linus sign my banana i feel like we should have like
[5070.84 --> 5078.44]  a assigned banana option um i wonder how difficult nick would know i wonder how difficult it would be to
[5078.44 --> 5084.60]  get like an rgb banana maybe maybe one of each one of the panels of the banana is a different color
[5084.60 --> 5090.60]  because i think it has different panels um and then sell those and they get signed or something i
[5090.60 --> 5095.56]  don't know they'd have to be like really expensive because that adds a lot of complication to like the
[5095.56 --> 5099.88]  whole process like it actually really does so they'd have to be like genuinely really expensive
[5099.88 --> 5103.40]  because you wouldn't want to do a ton of them it adds a lot of complication blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[5103.40 --> 5111.32]  um but i don't know anonymous says shipping costs more than the book so he bought an abcs of gaming
[5111.32 --> 5116.20]  book and he also got a lanyard and a desk pad and a pillow um shipping costs more than the book so i
[5116.20 --> 5121.00]  got other stuff too also you need a place to sign up for notifications for when products are available
[5121.00 --> 5126.84]  for sale like the screwdriver okay so we have back in stock notifications which don't work that great
[5126.84 --> 5134.20]  um we're using an external thing and if we make a v2 like a different version like we release the v2 of
[5134.20 --> 5139.72]  the water bottle it's extremely painful to the point where we didn't actually get it to work to have
[5139.72 --> 5144.44]  notifications go out for that which is frustrating so we might end up making our own but we have back
[5144.44 --> 5151.80]  in stock notifications but we don't have notifications for like pre items i don't even know how i would
[5151.80 --> 5155.72]  word that um but maybe maybe an idea for the future
[5159.16 --> 5165.88]  anonymous says ltt party shirt excited to wear ltt at the office ties anytime soon no idea go bug nick
[5165.88 --> 5173.88]  though on twitter he's your man myron mirren myron mirren uh love the show man any new info on the

[5199.80 --> 5203.88]  viewer so you know what i don't blame you it's fine uh i know but i know a lot of people would think

[5209.00 --> 5216.68]  uh uh uh you know a company branded shirt right now but it's really good stuff okay okay so yeah

[5231.32 --> 5239.40]  wasn't kidding let's go nice okay pierce any thoughts on elden ring uh it's not out yet right
[5239.40 --> 5245.56]  it looks really cool looks genuinely really cool i've been i've been really heads down trying to make
[5245.56 --> 5250.28]  the most of the whole linux challenge thing so i'm kind of like re-emerging right now um but some of the
[5250.28 --> 5255.72]  stuff i've seen around elden ring looks awesome jason thank you for being so in touch with your
[5255.72 --> 5260.12]  community slash audience base love your content because you are always up front and honest with us
[5260.12 --> 5266.92]  heck yeah paul says happy birthday samantha anonymous says finally i am home on friday evening
[5266.92 --> 5274.20]  i'm not uh benji says hey linus oh i'm gonna fix phones at school i'm really into right to repair
[5274.20 --> 5278.20]  heck yeah i was wondering what your view on the future of devices and repairability
[5278.20 --> 5282.12]  um he wants more of them so do i
[5287.00 --> 5289.24]  dpac says loving the mouse pad and water bottle nice
[5290.52 --> 5294.92]  pedro i appreciate your linux challenge helps bring exposure to it yeah hopefully
[5297.08 --> 5300.12]  i think it's gonna end up being positive i think there's already been positive things that have come
[5300.12 --> 5303.88]  from it i know certain members of the community have been very frustrated with it and very angry
[5303.88 --> 5308.04]  about certain things but there has also been members of the community that have been very positive
[5308.04 --> 5316.52]  about it and i think overall already even with part one which i think is a little divisive due to the
[5316.52 --> 5322.12]  you know the whole uh the whole i'm getting a team's message maybe they're kicking me off give me a second
[5322.12 --> 5338.60]  uh that's fine um what's i gonna say oh yeah due to the whole you know linus is telling steam thing uh
[5339.64 --> 5345.80]  considering that was still really positive i i think it's gonna be great i think i think linux people
[5345.80 --> 5351.40]  are gonna be stoked um they might not be stoked about how we describe certain things we might not
[5351.40 --> 5358.44]  describe it perfectly or or whatever but i i think uh i feel like our impact here is going to be
[5358.44 --> 5368.44]  positive overall people just figured out it's my birthday uh uh liviu i'm looking forward i'm looking
[5368.44 --> 5375.00]  forward for a hoodie without the large text it would be more suitable to be used at work when clearly
[5375.00 --> 5381.32]  branded clothes can't be used um yeah like someone said earlier in the show the stealth hoodie
[5381.32 --> 5385.72]  can like kind of get away with that but not not necessarily 100 keith i need to measure all the
[5385.72 --> 5392.20]  things got all the bananas and some lanyards and a water bottle very nice damon says love you guys
[5392.20 --> 5399.64]  got a party shirt someone else said love the new shirt got a party shirt very nice alex says any thoughts
[5399.64 --> 5406.92]  of doing a stealth desk pad the quality of the pad sounds amazing and i love the northern lights pattern
[5406.92 --> 5411.00]  but my desk is already cluttered also thanks for helping me get through a year of depression
