[0.00 → 2.16] this anxiety all the things I didn't do
[2.16 → 12.78] welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Wang to the Wang show we've got a fantastic show for you guys
[12.78 → 19.82] today we are back in the studio back bringing you the latest in tech and boy do I ever have
[19.82 → 26.82] some stuff to talk to you guys about I have tried the OLED switch now oh and I'm ready to talk about
[26.82 → 32.00] my experiences I did not get to host the short circuit because I was busy doing other stuff today
[32.00 → 37.92] and it sucks but I did manage to go crash Anthony's party and try it out so I'm going to talk about
[37.92 → 46.28] that that's cool also I ended up entering a feud with team viewer um over this last week because
[46.28 → 51.46] I've kind of had to do a little bit more remote desktop type stuff I'm I'm reformatting my
[51.46 → 57.66] personal rig as you guys know maybe we'll give you some updates on the uh Linux gaming challenge
[57.66 → 62.06] yep we don't want any spoilers obviously, but we are going to be talking about that what else we got
[62.06 → 69.72] today Luke uh I'm going to scroll down twitch has leaked just like the whole thing and Luke in
[69.72 → 76.36] particular I mean you might have noticed he works on an um a video streaming service so I'm sure he has a
[76.36 → 82.20] an interest in the contents of the twitch leak also our headline topic I didn't say it so you better
[82.20 → 90.00] say it steam deck oh yeah uh I thought you talked about that earlier but I guess not uh valve dangles
[90.00 → 94.26] steam deck internals in front of all of us they show us all the insides how to remove some of it
[94.26 → 98.86] and they announce some very cool things for right to repair and I was getting called out on our title
[98.86 → 102.80] for the video today I have more to say about steam deck this is in the pre-show do you really have
[102.80 → 111.08] more to say lines no but I am not the only host of the wan show hey there we go okay Luke this is a
[111.08 → 117.92] new leaf okay new set new attitude new luke first show I'm not even going to do it I'm not even
[117.92 → 122.52] going to talk for the rest of the show that's you go ahead that's rough you go ahead well we run the
[122.52 → 131.76] intro you can do that without talking no I can't do it you can't even hold it you can't hold it for
[131.76 → 139.52] the intro video you look like he's going to explode you guys didn't see it, but it was there
[139.52 → 148.86] all right I'm talking again oh okay let me see if I can figure out jake showed me how this is
[148.86 → 153.96] supposed to work I think I thought they were supposed to be up there by default uh no as well
[153.96 → 163.50] as see sonic as well as squashes now I toggle those back okay this is really this is really
[163.50 → 168.98] not that great that's fine let's go back to the white all right let's jump right into our headline
[168.98 → 176.22] topic today valve dangles steam deck internals in front of users says no touchy uh this was prepared
[176.22 → 184.62] by Anthony young sort of it's a little complicated so Luke did you watch valve's video yeah all right
[184.62 → 191.78] what are your thoughts I had the same thought you had part way through watching through the actual
[191.78 → 196.60] just video before I watched you guys watch the video you've watched both I did so you watched an
[196.60 → 200.12] actual video then you watched someone else react to the video I didn't know you guys were going to
[200.12 → 205.24] react to it how does it feel to be gen z all of a sudden just well i I watched you guys react to it
[205.24 → 213.32] because I was looking for a float plane showed out yes so I watched it at like one and a half speed or
[213.32 → 219.26] something right okay but anyway I watched the original video um, and it was good I'm very happy
[219.26 → 224.54] they made it the other option was oh no there are two other options as you kind of talked about so I'm
[224.54 → 228.80] happy they made it they picked like the middle option not making it would have been worse yeah but i
[228.80 → 233.68] yeah I think they should have worked with you guys ah yeah and like for a lot of the same reasons as
[233.68 → 238.46] I'm watching we had the same reactions as the okay we're going to unplug the battery and then the
[238.46 → 243.80] battery's randomly plugged back in we're gonna show like the the the thumb sticks out and then thumb sticks
[243.80 → 248.72] are going to be back in randomly it's just like ah like the cutting was a little weird but again
[248.72 → 254.10] I really don't want to hammer on them too much for it because at least they made it at all
[254.10 → 259.60] now here's something though I ended up getting called out in the comments under that video I think
[259.60 → 266.30] I had a couple of people tweet at me saying Linus you didn't even understand okay it was like satirical
[266.30 → 273.36] it's like the portal sense of humour and I'm sitting here going no, no I don't think so and again I mean
[273.36 → 281.08] it wasn't a horrible video no um it just could have been better yeah uh and like to be clear they did
[281.08 → 285.82] obviously have a sense of humour about it this is funny we actually missed this in our reaction video
[285.82 → 290.56] because we thought it was over but at the very end of the video they say something along the lines of
[290.56 → 295.88] and if you've been following all of these instructions you won't have done any of that stuff
[295.88 → 300.50] and then and then they close up the video so absolutely they had a sense of humour about it but
[300.50 → 307.38] I guarantee you that it was not intentional for them to be working on the machine with the battery
[307.38 → 313.28] plugged in yeah after they specifically said unplug the battery in order to work on the machine
[313.28 → 318.94] because that is actually very important it seemed like they shot everything yeah and then voice
[318.94 → 324.20] over it, and it really didn't line up all that well yes so they had to like to cut it kind of oddly yes i
[324.20 → 328.24] thought the presenter was like actually pretty good but anyway it was uh it was an exciting video
[328.24 → 336.24] um the the specifically calling out and i I heard it as well he only really specified I think
[336.24 → 342.36] it was the thumb sticks yeah but any amount of like replaceable parts is going to be really cool and
[342.36 → 348.22] especially the thumb sticks yeah because like and i I believe Anthony called this out but thumb sticks
[348.22 → 354.46] on things like the switch like oh my I mean another thing I got called out for was sort of um
[354.46 → 362.00] pretending that joy joystick drift is somehow a Nintendo exclusive image oh no uh problem issue
[362.00 → 368.30] that's the word I was looking for and no that I mean it's certainly a very famous one it's certainly
[368.30 → 375.58] been a huge problem in very recent memory but to be clear joystick drift is an enormous problem no matter
[375.58 → 380.30] what kind of joysticks and someone in the comments put it really well they're like no, no joystick
[380.30 → 387.76] problem joystick drift joystick failure is a problem for joysticks yeah every joystick will fail, and it's
[387.76 → 394.04] kind of inherent to the design you know what finally failed is my old thrust master top gun oh no i yeah i
[394.04 → 399.62] it wasn't working the last time I tried to use it and I opened it up I was like okay, so these are just
[399.62 → 408.66] potentiometers um is this something that I can a few short google searches later nope PNG if i really
[408.66 → 414.10] want another one of these eBay is the way I will just I will just buy another one because you know
[414.10 → 420.60] what the problem is at the time that was bought for me as a kid right I was like seven or eight years
[420.60 → 427.52] old or something like that maybe nine, and it was kind of a small joystick so that I could use it as a kid
[427.52 → 435.66] well nowadays any high quality joystick because the joystick market has consolidated a lot there used to be
[435.66 → 441.76] tons of vendors all kinds of high quality sticks because joystick games were far more popular I mean
[441.76 → 450.08] mech warrior was like a maybe not triple a bit at least a single a double a title I also think well
[450.08 → 457.40] like Microsoft simulator Microsoft Flight Simulator is like a thing today it was I would say proportionally
[457.40 → 462.06] a much bigger thing in the past yeah I think that's I think that's fair to say as well so that that whole
[462.06 → 467.30] genre of like space Sims and flight Sims was enormous back then, and so we had all these options
[467.30 → 473.56] anyway the problem that I have now is that every high quality joystick is really designed for adult
[473.56 → 481.78] hands and so i just I don't I can't reach the all the buttons i they're they're all sucks I find a
[481.78 → 487.18] lot of high quality ones like the warthog which is a really nice one yeah it's very heavy yeah and
[487.18 → 492.34] it's like the grip is one thing, but it's very heavy and that can almost result in it being slower i
[492.34 → 497.30] think we talked about this before the top gun is really fast yeah twitch reactions were perfect
[497.30 → 503.88] with it um to get back to the the the joystick drift I think the reason why i kind of jumped to
[503.88 → 508.92] Nintendo right away yeah is one I think the switch controllers probably get abused a lot more than
[508.92 → 513.14] other controllers yeah that's fair just slipped into a backpack in bags and stuff like that and also
[513.14 → 517.38] switch controllers are really expensive so yes I think you got a little bit of a combination I'm
[517.38 → 521.74] not trying to like hammer on Nintendo specifically, but we can hammer on Nintendo for their controllers
[521.74 → 527.62] being way too expensive for what they are it's ridiculous yeah so that's that's why that like
[527.62 → 534.44] immediately came to mind is if there was a more easily user fixable joycon thing that would be
[534.44 → 540.76] great that would be really, really cool elimination twitch TV says no mech warrior 2 was definitely triple a
[540.76 → 544.04] back in the day everyone played it back then yeah that's fair that's fair
[544.04 → 553.74] so other than that I mean is there anything else to really say other than good guy valve
[553.74 → 556.90] what do you think that they could do better if anything
[556.90 → 569.20] I'd like to know and like maybe this can come down the line but I'd like to know the full list of
[569.20 → 574.16] like replaceable hardware that they're going to be offering you guys mentioned probably not the PCBs
[574.16 → 580.18] whatever I don't know but I would like to know specifically what the offer actually is sure i
[580.18 → 584.26] think that would be cool and that's I mean that's going to happen because eventually they'll have to
[584.26 → 589.08] make them available somewhere and then that's your list um but yeah no I think it's I think it's good
[589.08 → 595.16] something I said to you uh after I had watched that video was that I'm just I'm really stoked that like
[595.16 → 598.72] from between the framework and now this and there's a topic we're going to be talking about
[598.72 → 602.68] later on in the show with that has to do with Microsoft which is really exciting there's a lot
[602.68 → 609.92] of brands that are making repairability a selling point I'm completely okay with that um right to
[609.92 → 615.66] repair and repairability are things that I am very happy to be sold to me to be completely honest now
[615.66 → 620.58] here's my challenge for valve I think they've done a really great job with the steam deck so I don't
[620.58 → 624.54] really have anything to add to that I think committing to replaceable components and designing
[624.54 → 632.88] it uh from the ground up to be more easily repairable is great a plus now take that
[632.88 → 637.16] philosophy and apply it to your other bloody products I had an issue with an index controller
[637.16 → 644.44] a little while ago where what happened was um definitely not my fault couldn't have been me but
[644.44 → 651.80] one of the joysticks like the topper of it the actual joystick itself was no longer attached to
[651.80 → 657.62] the controller did you hit something I mean with the cut Luke I'm trying to tell a story here
[657.62 → 665.82] okay keep going i actually I don't remember I didn't notice doing it I don't remember doing it
[665.82 → 672.76] but because i never ever used them yeah it could have been missing for weeks and I wouldn't have even
[672.76 → 678.84] noticed right because what would I use a joystick for all I do is wiggle my arms around like this
[678.84 → 686.52] right and so everything is a pointing interface I literally don't touch the joysticks ever uh anyway
[686.52 → 693.08] the point is I contacted valve support I was like hey look I just want a new joystick the ribbon cable
[693.08 → 699.64] is still intact, and the sensor is still there I just do you I'll buy it i I recognize that this was
[699.64 → 707.08] 99 my fault uh I own that but i I would like to how do I get replacement parts for it, and they're like
[707.08 → 714.12] we will send you an entirely new controller so obviously as a customer I'm perfectly happy with
[714.12 → 717.96] that solution because it means that I get a new controller and I can a lot of ways I can start
[717.96 → 724.36] playing beat safer again but I also have to wonder okay what happens to that controller, and it's not just
[724.36 → 730.28] replaceable parts that will wear, or that will could fall off that could be broken like a joystick
[730.28 → 738.36] it's also batteries right like every device with a lithium battery in it is going to be e-waste in 10
[738.36 → 747.16] years yeah it is that simple it will and that's one of the reasons that people ride on Microsoft
[747.16 → 755.88] about using double-a batteries in their controllers, but that is in my humble opinion that is
[755.88 → 764.76] Microsoft having the bravery to in spite of public opinion do the right thing because if you care about
[764.76 → 772.76] the environment at all you should be getting double a rechargeable battery and using them for years and
[772.76 → 776.68] years and years instead of putting disposable batteries in it because I see that argument made
[776.68 → 782.68] like oh Microsoft is being so irresponsible because disposable batteries landfills Xbox controllers stop
[782.68 → 789.88] buying the ones that you can't recharge the really shocking part to me is how it's inexpensive
[789.88 → 798.76] rechargeable batteries are now why is anyone ever buying a disposable double-a battery in the year 2021 yeah
[798.76 → 804.68] you can even buy ones where you like you flip the top open the capacity sucks do they yeah the
[804.68 → 810.04] capacity sucks how long are you playing with an Xbox controller for uh yeah just it's its really low
[810.04 → 814.52] it's really low because cells are they're packed I don't remember what I used it in but I had some for
[814.52 → 820.76] years and I thought they were fine uh hold on Amazon basics double-a batteries okay rechargeable here
[820.76 → 827.56] we go how much are these stupid things I don't know what power owl is okay so a 16 pack of
[827.56 → 838.84] 2 000 William hour double-a batteries from Amazon is 22.99 okay a 20 pack of alkaline disposables
[839.48 → 848.28] because you can just hot swap a 20 pack of disposables is eight dollars you only have to use them
[848.28 → 854.28] three times I don't even you know I used to be that when i uh like gave away kids toys and stuff like
[854.28 → 861.24] that i would like painstakingly open up every single one and double check and make sure
[861.24 → 865.64] that I didn't leave my rechargeable batteries in it and i I still try to empty them because you're not
[865.64 → 869.80] supposed to leave them uh with a battery in it but if there's something at the bottom of the pile and
[869.80 → 873.48] I'm like oh did I check that one I'm not going to worry about it too much these days because they are
[873.48 → 882.12] literally like a dollar 25 each and they still have Sango envelops here at the office that we still use for
[882.12 → 888.92] our mic packs that have been in service for almost 10 years yeah they yes they don't last quite as long
[888.92 → 895.00] oh I'm sorry but i I think that Microsoft has done the right thing to continue with double-a batteries
[895.00 → 902.36] and I think that they should never take flack for releasing a device here there this is my hot take
[902.36 → 910.44] nobody should ever get pushback for releasing a device that uses standard easily replaceable batteries
[911.00 → 915.48] that are yeah that have rechargeable options which they basically all do which they basically all do
[915.48 → 919.32] I mean you can even get decent rechargeable nine volts now so that's what we use for we have a
[919.32 → 924.92] microphone that's uh has a wireless receiver that uses nine volts, and so we just we have rechargeable
[924.92 → 934.84] nine volts now it's just it just blows me away it blows me away that anyone like I have Xbox 360
[934.84 → 941.24] Luke you were over the other day and uh he's like oh this is nice it was nice yeah uh because I have
[941.24 → 946.76] Xbox 360 controllers that are still in service yeah and still get exactly the same battery life that they
[946.76 → 954.36] did 12 years ago because I put new batteries in them, it's not it's not rocket science it's great
[955.48 → 959.64] and envelops like yeah envelops are a little bit more premium, but they're honestly still
[960.28 → 966.68] how much did you say the 16 pack was um 16 pack are envelops still around I thought Sango sold
[966.68 → 973.88] uh the envelop they seem still around they're Panasonic now okay that makes sense uh the 16 pack was
[973.88 → 982.36] 23. Okay so I don't know how many are in here it doesn't say, but it's a fairly yeah 16 for 40. Even that
[982.36 → 987.16] is perfectly reasonable that's like those I would say those aren't the pros or whatever but those
[987.16 → 991.96] are going to be premium you only have to get five uses out of them and that's it now there's certain
[991.96 → 999.56] devices that sometimes I'll just go you know what it's its not worth it like uh a TV remote control
[1001.72 → 1007.64] rechargeable batteries do tend to drain faster on their own like just passively they're a lot better now
[1007.64 → 1012.84] than they used to be back in the nickel metal hydride nickel cadmium I guess was some of
[1012.84 → 1018.52] the earlier rechargeable batteries because remember our hydra devices back then the big one was digital
[1018.52 → 1025.24] cameras and so when you would load up your four double a batteries into the grip of it or whatever
[1025.24 → 1034.92] and you'd get like you, we oh my man I'm taking I'm taken back Luke I'm taken back it used to be a
[1034.92 → 1039.24] thing and this would have probably been before your time you probably would have been too young and not
[1039.24 → 1043.16] caring about digital cameras yet by this point because you're you're like four years younger than
[1043.16 → 1049.64] me something like that yeah so when I was when I was like 14 so you would have been 10 so it probably
[1049.64 → 1056.28] wouldn't matter digital cameras on the store shelf used to have as part of their spec sheet how many
[1056.28 → 1063.88] shots you could take yeah okay you do remember that, and it would be substantially less with rechargeable
[1063.88 → 1069.56] because the rechargeable of the day had really poor capacity they took forever to charge and they
[1069.56 → 1076.12] would drain while you were not using them nowadays it's not nearly as bad, although there are devices like
[1076.12 → 1082.68] uh TV remote where you will get three or four years sometimes out of a single change of batteries
[1083.16 → 1088.12] and it's you would just be constantly changing out your rechargeable compared to how often you would
[1088.12 → 1094.92] have to uh put in disposables, so there are situations where I do get lazy and use disposables rather than
[1094.92 → 1100.60] just buying more and more and more rechargeable for my entire house, but it really doesn't uh it really
[1100.60 → 1105.96] doesn't come up that often any more right yeah I don't even remember I don't even remember what
[1105.96 → 1110.68] we were talking about something to do right the index controller
[1111.88 → 1117.24] and I don't even know I don't even know that the right answer with the index controller is to put
[1117.96 → 1125.16] um to put double a batteries in it is would probably be too heavy uh with that said I mean oculus
[1125.16 → 1132.20] managed it, but the index controller also has a lot more functionality yeah than the oculus uh than
[1132.20 → 1137.96] the oculus controllers yeah, so maybe that's not the right answer but having it be easily accessible
[1137.96 → 1144.36] with a little screw panel so that you could at least not throw away the entire controller uh would
[1144.36 → 1149.16] help because you can, i know like my brother and some other people that I know have had
[1149.16 → 1154.92] wireless headphones, and they replace those lithium-ion batteries anyway sometimes with ones that are
[1154.92 → 1161.24] even bigger and stuff which is kind of nice all right so Anthony has a few notes in here about the
[1161.24 → 1168.68] SSD valve claims it shouldn't be upgraded uh it has an EMI shield on it that is right next to the Wi-Fi
[1168.68 → 1178.44] module or the Wi-Fi antennas would you buy a third party backing that allows you to put a larger SSD in it
[1178.44 → 1184.84] would that just be like have you pre-ordered one yeah actually you have okay, okay so then I pre-ordered
[1184.84 → 1189.24] one the day we talked about on LAN show as a future I actually pre-ordered it in the background while we
[1189.24 → 1197.80] were still on LAN show because I wanted to not get too late in the queue all right I'll allow it I'll allow
[1197.80 → 1202.36] it I'll allow it so then okay if someone makes something like that available do you plan to buy it
[1202.36 → 1210.12] um not immediately because i would self-analyze my use case to see if i actually
[1210.12 → 1216.44] really needed eight terabyte steam deck anyone but like do i um why am I my games drive my computer
[1216.44 → 1224.36] isn't even that full I guess that's fair you're mostly like a play a game and then move on
[1224.36 → 1229.40] kind of player aren't you yeah I guess that's for most the things that I tend to go back to are
[1229.40 → 1235.64] usually like indie games that are tiny gondola says WTF Luke bought something it must be really
[1235.64 → 1243.16] good holy ship I'm pretty excited about the steam deck i I think it's going to be really cool um now i
[1243.16 → 1248.68] think that transitions us pretty well into our next topic here which is obviously going to be getting
[1248.68 → 1254.28] you guys an update on the Linux gaming challenge ah if you guys have been checking out the stories that
[1254.28 → 1259.24] I've been uploading on the LTT channel there's a couple of little oh I didn't know that early teasers in
[1259.24 → 1266.12] there but okay without giving away too many spoilers I think it's you know we've both recorded
[1266.12 → 1273.64] our or you've at least got down what we're going to say in our uh you know our pre pre-installation
[1273.64 → 1281.00] blurbs because the first video is going to be me sort of talking about the process of getting started
[1281.00 → 1287.72] so i actually i it's like 500 600 words and I go through I've got a rant about how utterly useless
[1287.72 → 1294.36] every you know best Linux distro listicle is yeah it's its kind of hilarious there's this one man
[1294.36 → 1297.96] this is going to be too many spoilers I don't even care let's just let's talk about it let's talk about
[1297.96 → 1306.92] it I read through one where you're already ready for this I know it under Ubuntu okay you've got you've
[1306.92 → 1312.84] got that it's easy to use and beginner-friendly and kind of pain to set up
[1315.56 → 1324.44] how can you have this is the same listicle okay it has pros easy to use beginner-friendly cons
[1324.44 → 1334.28] kind of pain to set up which one is it I found a few i I found a few YouTube videos yeah I wish I could
[1334.28 → 1339.40] remember the creator names from because they're actually quite good but what I found was more
[1339.40 → 1347.32] useful was if I was comparing two very specific DES or sure two very specific distros now that's another
[1347.32 → 1352.20] thing down to like something more narrow everything's full of jargon so you just said DE
[1353.08 → 1360.92] yeah what is a de if I didn't know anything if I didn't know enough about the modularity of Linux for
[1360.92 → 1367.16] example if I was really coming at this from a just normal gamer perspective and people started
[1367.16 → 1373.24] talking about DES even if they didn't shorten it to DES even if they said desktop environment you'd
[1373.24 → 1378.76] probably think it was the distro they were talking about and to be fair for most people um like i
[1378.76 → 1386.04] would argue that when most people think about say mint sure they're just automatically mentally
[1386.04 → 1390.20] bundling in that you're using cinnamon I would argue that when most people are talking about
[1390.20 → 1393.72] uh solace they're thinking of budgie when they're talking about Ubuntu they're thinking about gnome
[1393.72 → 1398.28] like yes you can have other ones a lot of these come packaged with other ones like you can get yeah
[1398.28 → 1404.12] you can get Ubuntu budgie uh sure but like most people if they just say Ubuntu are probably talking
[1404.12 → 1412.84] about Ubuntu with gnome sure um so the first bit is me sort of it is ends up a little Randy because
[1412.84 → 1420.76] it's just ridiculous coming in is an absolute no nothing honestly I wouldn't be surprised if you
[1420.76 → 1426.92] immediately read one article and go forget this is too much yeah I think the distro and desktop
[1426.92 → 1435.96] environment uh selection process is probably too daunting alone for the average user and so after that
[1435.96 → 1443.08] i basically uh I talk about what the process was like for me, I run through what my plan is and then
[1443.08 → 1448.68] we're going to cut to Luke he talks through what his plan is and then I don't know if I told you this but
[1448.68 → 1455.64] Anthony is going to listen to each of our plans no, no he doesn't get to talk to us so part of the whole
[1455.64 → 1460.76] challenge is that Luke and I have to do this the way a normal user would I mean I've had developers reach
[1460.76 → 1468.36] out multiple developers from major distributions to talk to me because obviously they want you to use
[1468.36 → 1472.68] their stuff they want me to use their stuff and not just that they don't just want me to use their
[1472.68 → 1475.88] stuff because it's a good marketing exercise I think they're just really proud of their work and
[1475.88 → 1480.20] so they should be and i think that's probably very genuinely a thing with the open source
[1480.20 → 1487.80] community absolutely 100 give them that absolutely, but that's not representative of the normal
[1487.80 → 1495.24] person's experience and in order to be the best that I can be in order to be the best ally that i
[1495.24 → 1501.48] can be for the open source community and for the Linux community I should try to tackle this as a
[1501.48 → 1509.16] normal user should and I should be able to give my honest feedback without someone preemptively guiding
[1509.16 → 1515.16] me through so even though we are going to have Anthony there for the benefit of the viewers Anthony doesn't
[1515.16 → 1521.32] get to talk to us interesting okay cool yeah no 100 yeah so from there I want to address one thing
[1521.32 → 1525.88] before we go forward because I saw another comment about it yeah I think uh I spread it further when
[1525.88 → 1530.76] I tweeted out like what's four of these distros do people think I should use yeah and I included fedora
[1530.76 → 1536.68] and then in brackets for the meme I don't mean that fedora the distro is a meme I mean that fedora the
[1536.68 → 1544.20] name is a meme it really is a meme come on guys like we use it we use if it's good it's really
[1544.20 → 1551.00] stable it's great just the name is a meme okay, okay sorry let's keep going all right so I mean oh my god
[1551.00 → 1559.88] even the red hat logo yes like come on guys clearly self-aware clearly at least some of the
[1559.88 → 1568.60] people at red hat are self-aware anyway the point is um after that so after Anthony critiques our plans
[1568.60 → 1574.60] it goes into a vlog and I don't know how you shot your portion, but mine is me with like my phone
[1575.24 → 1582.04] and no okay there will be some spoilers not too many spoilers but I end up back and forth between my
[1582.04 → 1587.88] desktop and my server room which is on the other side of the wall where my machine is actually plugged in
[1587.88 → 1596.12] a fair bit oh wow a fair bit because I mean you got to remember you got to remember you can't take
[1596.12 → 1602.68] anything for granted right I use a thunderbolt dog for literally all of my peripherals someone at float
[1602.68 → 1611.32] plane brought up that that might be an issue I have a very, very unusual setup definitely all of my audio
[1611.32 → 1619.08] is routed through a go SLR a device that has quite literally zero acknowledgement from the manufacturer
[1619.08 → 1625.16] of the fact that Linux exists at all and all this legato stuff uh I don't actually have a ton of legato
[1625.16 → 1630.68] stuff at home I've got my key lights but key lights my workaround is going to be using the phone app
[1630.68 → 1635.80] which they do have oh right okay, okay I can't be giving you too many hints we got to work through these
[1635.80 → 1640.52] problems on our own do you okay all right all right all right all right all right all right
[1640.52 → 1646.04] so legato uh key lights I have those and I have a stream deck but I'm just sad I wasted time now but
[1646.04 → 1652.04] anyway yeah I don't I don't use my stream deck so yeah I don't really care yeah
[1654.68 → 1658.92] anyway the point is i oh okay I'm not gonna
[1658.92 → 1669.24] uh okay part one the part one challenge is to install Linux choose a distro install Linux and play
[1669.24 → 1677.56] a game that's it is took me longer to find the screw for the m.2 drive uh than it did for me to
[1677.56 → 1687.88] finish the entire first challenge okay um I am a smart boy and I keep all my m.2 screws in my motherboard
[1687.88 → 1692.04] even when I get a brand-new board I take all the m.2 screws and I put them it was your motherboard
[1692.04 → 1695.48] it wasn't there really yeah well bro
[1699.48 → 1707.80] I did it with my new machine so I have all my m.2 screws oh it's the that azure aqua one isn't it
[1707.80 → 1714.76] hey look price was right oh it was fantastic I'm still stoked your computer was free sir I was only
[1714.76 → 1720.68] using it as like a reference that I did the rest of it relatively quickly that show off um anyway
[1720.68 → 1727.96] the point is uh I did not get it done that quickly okay, so part one is to play a game I actually did not
[1727.96 → 1736.28] strictly speaking complete the part one challenge in like three hours not strictly speaking not strictly
[1736.28 → 1742.04] speaking because my intention when I actually created the original here I'm not signed in to Trello on this
[1742.04 → 1748.04] machine but when I created the original like Trello list of all the parts of this series part one is
[1748.04 → 1755.24] supposed to be um install and play a game on the distro of your choice yeah part two is supposed to be
[1755.24 → 1760.44] I got i have to pull up Trello here because I can't remember exactly I think it was I think it was yeah
[1760.44 → 1766.36] install like steam and play a game Linus steam was the easy one okay part two is got your game
[1766.36 → 1774.12] streaming setup working perfectly so mics levels capture camera um I have to get a VPN working so
[1774.12 → 1783.16] that I can download assets like just sort of general use stuff uh part three is uh get as many
[1783.16 → 1790.28] game launchers running as possible and run a game on them so we're aiming to get as many of the big ones
[1790.28 → 1795.00] as we can and even maybe some smaller ones part four is going to be fun I've talked to jams about
[1795.00 → 1801.56] this now, and it's going to be hey by the way gaming is not the only thing you do some other stuff so
[1801.56 → 1807.72] we're going to have challenges like edit a quick video together uh create a document uh zip up some
[1807.72 → 1815.56] files and send them to someone print something uh watch Netflix um something to do with Excel and don't
[1815.56 → 1821.32] don't do any of those things now don't get ahead of yourself on that one no practicing okay that one
[1821.32 → 1825.80] I'm not ahead on okay the other ones I am all right okay well I'm ahead on some of the streaming
[1825.80 → 1829.88] stuff too okay, okay so I'm already working on it, I'm just making a lot of notes because I think it's
[1829.88 → 1835.96] going to end up being a lot of screen capture and a lot of like kinds of ranting about stuff so as long
[1835.96 → 1839.56] as you're making notes and as long as your screen recording as often as you can then I think
[1839.56 → 1844.04] we're in pretty good shape uh that was one of the reasons actually that I got some of the streaming
[1844.04 → 1851.48] stuff going yeah that's the same for me before I even finished challenge one oh wow because I wanted
[1851.48 → 1858.60] to be able to screen cap yeah that makes sense right fortunately obs is a thing and mostly operates the
[1858.60 → 1865.24] same so I was able to get that going and then part five I think is honestly just going to be the
[1865.24 → 1871.40] conclusion right so we summarize, and we make an ultimate decision about whether to go back to windows
[1871.40 → 1876.76] or not talk about killer apps that we miss talk about killer apps on Linux that we're going to
[1876.76 → 1881.40] miss uh what are the things we found that we really enjoyed what are the things we hated so now let's
[1881.40 → 1887.56] get back to part one and talk about how it is that I did not manage to complete the challenge when I wrote
[1887.56 → 1894.68] this down right that was why I brought my phone out I wrote part one get Linux or actually gnu slash
[1894.68 → 1901.64] Linux and play a game with sound that's what it says verbatim because yes I even make jokes when I'm
[1901.64 → 1909.96] the only one who will ever read them I couldn't get sound working sound couldn't get sound working I've
[1909.96 → 1917.00] heard it magically fixed itself oh the next day I didn't do anything different and I have screened
[1917.00 → 1923.40] capture of it not working, and then it magically works I promise you I did nothing, and it's Linux so it
[1923.40 → 1929.32] probably didn't update itself because it would wait for you to ask you to do the laptop just okay
[1930.20 → 1937.16] um that's interesting yeah I remember like way back one of my times using Linux like way in the past
[1937.16 → 1942.76] getting sound stuff working on one of my laptops was quite a hurdle um but this time I just had
[1942.76 → 1949.80] to change the device it was actually yeah i was pretty lucky i had some I had some challenges
[1949.80 → 1955.24] yeah uh okay so tell me this tell me this at least I've already got a killer app on the Linux
[1955.24 → 1961.00] side by the way proprietary or open source and video driver proprietary you went with the proprietary
[1961.00 → 1966.28] driver yeah it's a piece of crap yes it is I'm struggling with it right now it's kind of shocking
[1966.28 → 1971.16] I'm I've I've I haven't done enough of it and I want to do a lot of documentation of it actually
[1971.16 → 1975.32] including some benchmarks that I want to throw in yeah that I think might be kind of fun I know it's not
[1975.32 → 1981.32] part of the challenge, but it might be interesting anyway um of like how do I pronounce it no
[1981.32 → 1989.88] VU no VU I don't know the open source driver whatever so that one versus uh 470 versus 460
[1989.88 → 1996.76] which are the two official right sure but like I've had some issues for sure yeah that just feels
[1997.32 → 2003.08] gross like I don't know have you like thrown windows around and done stuff like that a little bit
[2003.08 → 2008.04] I've noticed that compared to my windows experience things are a little bit more like
[2008.92 → 2014.76] yes um yeah even with like do you have the refresh rate fixed uh I managed to get my refresh rate
[2014.76 → 2018.04] sorted out pretty quickly that was one of the first things I did because I get triggered when
[2018.04 → 2024.12] my screen is running at 60 hertz these days yeah it was really apparent yeah I thought that was the
[2024.12 → 2031.24] whole problem at first it felt worse like 60 hertz felt worse than 60 hertz yes uh but now that I'm at
[2031.24 → 2040.44] 120 it's totally fine what about g-sync i I haven't verified that it's running I have verified that it's
[2040.44 → 2046.52] running okay but I cannot find a toggle if for whatever reason I wanted to turn it off interesting
[2046.52 → 2052.04] so that's where I'm at on that because remember like my someone in the uh in the YouTube chat pointed
[2052.04 → 2058.68] out and this is very true my setup is super cutting edge and exotic in a lot of ways
[2058.68 → 2065.96] like g-sync over HDMI is you might think yeah g-sync that's not new technology but g-sync over HDMI only
[2065.96 → 2071.48] came up really in the last year or two yeah you have quite a few unique challenges and no joke a year
[2071.48 → 2077.96] or two is not a long time if you don't have really excellent cooperation from the manufacturer to get
[2077.96 → 2086.36] something working in Linux yeah especially when it's super high-end because the priority for Linux in
[2086.36 → 2093.24] general in my from my perception is openness and sustainability not like cutting edge gaming
[2093.80 → 2099.88] and that's just that that's that's just the way it is so a lot of the cutting edge gaming stuff that i
[2099.88 → 2107.32] have and that I do is just not going to be um not going to be a priority for most Linux developers now
[2107.32 → 2112.84] the reason we're doing this challenge is that it's hopefully changing, and the steam deck is a big part
[2112.84 → 2117.00] of that that's why we transition from talking about steam deck to this because steam deck will be
[2117.00 → 2123.88] running Linux yeah, but it's going to take time another thing someone brought up is you're also running an
[2123.88 → 2131.72] NVIDIA GPU right yeah so we almost certainly would have had an easier time on both sides if we were
[2131.72 → 2137.64] running AMD GPUs yeah possibly but then I wouldn't be running g-sync at all actually I'm thinking yeah
[2137.64 → 2143.08] free sync over HDMI is a thing on that monitor oh actually I don't know it's not the HGTV it's
[2143.08 → 2150.20] AOR's monitor I have no idea how it behaves with free sync not sure no idea there's a lot of
[2150.20 → 2154.20] differences when it comes down to hardware I was even kind of wondering like I don't think a titan
[2154.20 → 2162.28] RTX is like a super common card no, but it's similar enough to the 2000 series it's basically a 2080 ti
[2162.28 → 2167.32] which is basically a jacked up 2080 like I'm not actually expecting that to be a problem for me
[2167.32 → 2174.12] I will tell you though just man I don't know what it is I think i just I attract misery sometimes
[2175.24 → 2181.48] the first game I tried to play I was like oh I've really been enjoying cave story plus it's an older
[2181.48 → 2188.28] game it's Linux native it doesn't get a Linux native client first game I picked has issues with
[2188.28 → 2194.44] launching off to the side okay so like part of the frame was cut off has issues with controller
[2194.44 → 2199.88] support the sound wasn't working and for whatever reason this particular game not every game other
[2199.88 → 2206.12] ones are fine cross code was fine bro force was fine this particular game doesn't support cross-platform
[2206.12 → 2212.04] cloud saves on steam so I had no sound couldn't see part of the frame couldn't use my controller and my
[2212.04 → 2219.72] save file was gone so that was my very first Linux gaming experience on my new machines I've definitely
[2219.72 → 2225.08] ran into the cross-platform cloud saves thing that's unfortunate that didn't really make it into
[2225.08 → 2233.00] my notes okay well it's in mine so just for me that wasn't like starting to game on Linux that was
[2233.00 → 2238.52] specifically transferring from windows to Linux which I guess is part of it but yeah I don't know either way
[2238.52 → 2244.68] first game I launched was ft had none of those issues just didn't have my save yeah so yeah but
[2244.68 → 2254.60] it worked yeah, so there's been a lot of yeahs there's having you tried another launcher um another launcher
[2254.60 → 2262.36] sorry what do you mean by launcher like net origin oh no, no no not yet i I haven't even gotten as far as
[2262.36 → 2269.40] playing games with proton yet i I'm not I've I've only put maybe well remember first I put three
[2269.40 → 2276.20] hours into getting cave story running with no sound I did manage to fix the off kilter the off kilter
[2276.20 → 2281.16] rendering I ran in steam big picture mode what I was trying to diagnose at the time was actually the
[2281.16 → 2287.08] controller support I was like oh well big picture just solved it big pick part of big pictures whole jam
[2287.08 → 2292.04] is you know just making it super easy for controllers to work in steam games uh and in
[2292.04 → 2296.20] the interface so I figure okay if I go right into it from the interface I think the controller issue
[2296.20 → 2302.12] ended up being kind of webcam and I was just I was just kind of overwhelmed by all the other issues that
[2302.12 → 2307.64] had cropped up in this game like I think I didn't select controller before trying to rebind my thing like
[2307.64 → 2314.68] it's kind of a weird interface that that game has um but anyway i it can be sometimes a little hard to
[2314.68 → 2321.08] differentiate between webcam and the user experience just being pretty rough yeah so I did solve the
[2321.08 → 2326.76] off-centre thing with steam big picture it would go right dead centre and then I tried it
[2326.76 → 2330.68] again not in big picture, and it was off to the right again and then the next day when I came back and
[2330.68 → 2340.44] sound was working it launched without big picture dead centre and I was like okay all right thank you
[2340.44 → 2346.84] a little bit yeah that's cool oh man the uh the launcher experience is interesting that's all I'll
[2346.84 → 2352.04] say launcher experience okay well hey I have that to look forward to make sure you're working on the
[2352.04 → 2357.40] challenges kind of one at a time though Luke otherwise things are going to end up kind of sloppy i only
[2357.40 → 2365.56] added one other launcher to be fair okay all right and I was just I was very curious um I haven't
[2365.56 → 2370.04] gamed on Linux at all before oh basically every time I've installed if it's been on a laptop, and it was
[2370.04 → 2376.68] for school right um so they were always for like software development or just like studying
[2376.68 → 2385.56] education productivity stuff in general anyway um so is it Curtis yeah Curtis is like super cool
[2386.28 → 2387.32] and very powerful
[2390.04 → 2395.32] and I don't want to add too much more to it yeah okay fair enough but i was very curious and
[2395.32 → 2399.80] like trying out Curtis I've never tried it before these are my notes for part two
[2399.80 → 2407.56] already just to give you some idea um I mean honestly kind of getting worried my size just
[2407.56 → 2413.24] be really boring a lot of it's well maybe that'll be that maybe that'll be refreshing for the Linux
[2413.24 → 2419.72] community because honestly I can tell you right now the Linux community is going to absolutely hate
[2419.72 → 2426.44] my part one they are going to hate it and some of them will probably hate me because
[2426.44 → 2435.32] you just honestly I couldn't I I couldn't, I couldn't write some of the stuff that happened to me
[2435.96 → 2442.52] like I couldn't, I couldn't make it up um truth was stranger than fiction and the thing is anytime i
[2442.52 → 2448.68] say anything whether it's positive or whether it's negative there's going to be a small subset of users who are
[2448.68 → 2456.20] going to say he's shilling for this or trashing that or whatever he's got it he's got some agenda
[2456.20 → 2463.40] he's got some hidden motivation right and I guarantee it now mark my words someone who didn't watch this
[2463.40 → 2470.04] show didn't see me make this prediction is going to accuse me of fabricating yeah some of the things
[2470.04 → 2475.88] that went wrong for me to make it more dramatic and to make it dramatic or to dunk on Linux or whatever
[2475.88 → 2484.20] whatever maybe they think that Bill Gates's vaccine in my 5g reception is making me chill for windows
[2484.20 → 2490.52] like I don't I don't know I can't, I can't put myself in the head of these people but I guarantee you
[2490.52 → 2499.72] that based on my experience someone will not believe how badly it went for me and will find a way to
[2499.72 → 2505.96] make it about my hidden agenda here and then hopefully, hopefully yeah hopefully my side does
[2505.96 → 2510.36] at least my part one because I haven't done the rest of it so maybe we'll maybe we'll switch sides
[2510.36 → 2515.16] later on um but hopefully my part one does contrast that because the biggest problems
[2515.16 → 2522.68] that I had required uh sometimes slightly more than but pretty much just a restart right that was
[2522.68 → 2527.40] that was like pretty much I was surprised how much I have to restart on windows or on Linux it's
[2527.40 → 2531.80] when windows have kind of fixed that there is some stuff you can get like I don't remember exactly
[2531.80 → 2537.24] what it's called, but there's a live updating tool right that makes you don't have to restart um yeah
[2537.24 → 2544.20] I don't know i just I was just surprised like i I booted up and was just doing stuff like nothing with
[2544.20 → 2548.76] a brand new fresh image it was like hey you need to restart your computer because like we did some
[2548.76 → 2555.00] stuff oh really that okay I mean I guess yeah I guess windows does it all the time too I guess i just
[2555.00 → 2558.52] don't notice because it just schedules it and then just like runs in the middle of the night some
[2558.52 → 2562.84] stuff like the like it did it automatically yeah okay we're having a very different experience
[2564.92 → 2572.12] I'll just say that much nothing happened automatically on my side um which was I I mean that's just
[2572.12 → 2578.68] probably I haven't revealed what distro and um desktop environment I'm using yet but that is going to be
[2578.68 → 2584.36] part of it this is great rich 77 Linus the Linux community is here to help not slam a new user we are
[2584.36 → 2593.08] here for you uh that's rich get it yeah like yes you know what I'm sure that it's a minority of
[2593.08 → 2599.80] extremely toxic users just like any fan community there's going to be a minority of really toxic users
[2599.80 → 2607.56] there's just there's a special there's a special kind of toxic gatekeeping that seems to go on in
[2607.56 → 2613.08] the Linux community, and you're going to get called out in this video sorry there is extreme
[2613.72 → 2617.72] there are a lot of extremes there's toxic gatekeeping and then there's people that will just like stop
[2617.72 → 2622.84] at nothing to try to make sure that you know the door is open as wide as possible yeah um, but there's
[2622.84 → 2627.64] sometimes to your detriment like no, no it's perfect it's perfect it's really there are no problems
[2627.64 → 2632.04] ever I'll help you can call me anytime night or day it's like right but I don't want to talk to
[2632.04 → 2638.36] you for three hours a day yeah I just want to use my computer this will work is there anything so far
[2638.36 → 2644.36] um and maybe this is going too much into it but is there anything so far that you've really liked or
[2644.36 → 2649.48] has gone really well hold on speed style says the Linux community is here for you now until they see
[2649.48 → 2656.76] your video and can't wait to correct everything you should have done yeah pretty much um so it's not so
[2656.76 → 2662.12] much that I've seen things that I absolutely love about Linux as much as I've been reminded that I should
[2662.12 → 2669.32] really make sure that I'm not coming at this from a completely one-sided standpoint and my rants should
[2669.32 → 2675.00] include rants about windows yeah okay something I complained about with Linux in general
[2675.00 → 2680.76] is that there's a dozen different ways to do things and from a normal person perspective I don't want
[2681.40 → 2688.52] a dozen different ways to do the same thing I don't want me to want one good fast way maybe an
[2688.52 → 2693.96] alternate way in the event that that way is not working like you know looking at you finder you
[2693.96 → 2697.88] know how you know you can't manually refresh the contents of a folder in finder because it should
[2697.88 → 2702.52] just work yeah it should, but sometimes it doesn't, and it needs a refresh button apple anyway
[2702.52 → 2711.56] the point is um I pointed that out like I found something that drove me you know really bananas uh and
[2711.56 → 2716.52] I pointed out that Microsoft has actually done an astonishingly bad job of that they started
[2716.52 → 2723.96] transitioning to their new style control panel with Windows 8. Windows 8 was when they started
[2723.96 → 2729.72] transitioning to remember the new control panel yeah when did Windows 8 come out Windows 8
[2729.72 → 2740.68] release it's like 2008 or something 2012 okay 2012 this was nine years ago nine years ago windows came out
[2740.68 → 2750.44] with this new control panel there is still core functionality in Windows 11 nine years later
[2750.44 → 2755.96] that you have to go into the classic control panel for so make up your mind Microsoft do we do it this
[2755.96 → 2761.00] way or do we do it that way just let me have the classic control panel in my opinion but yeah exactly
[2761.00 → 2766.52] well that's a whole that's a whole separate conversation I ran into another thing where I had just like i
[2766.52 → 2771.56] signed in to steam and all my like friend requests and crap popped up in the bottom right corner
[2772.12 → 2777.24] and I couldn't see anything in the bottom right corner or click on anything until it went away
[2777.24 → 2783.24] like yeah this is a terrible experience it happens to be exactly the same terrible experience on Windows
[2783.24 → 2788.68] I haven't tried it on 11 yet but on Windows 10 it's exactly the same way if you get like a handful of
[2788.68 → 2793.96] notifications at a time it's limited I think it's three, and then they go away and then there's not
[2793.96 → 2798.52] enough time to click on, and it stacks back up again, and you just can't click anything in your
[2798.52 → 2803.96] system tray until they're gone it's yeah it's horrible it's its like it's like the people using
[2803.96 → 2808.76] it never it's like the people designing the product never used if it's that kind of thing like I searched
[2808.76 → 2815.08] for this is great I searched for explorer okay in the start menu of one of our ingest stations to shoot
[2815.08 → 2822.92] a completely unrelated video yesterday and get this get guess what the top highlighted the best match was
[2823.96 → 2830.60] well okay first of all what do you think I wanted i I'm assuming you wanted like actually I don't know
[2830.60 → 2836.76] why would you search explorer yeah well what what what like what do you think I might have
[2836.76 → 2844.44] been trying to do my brain immediately jumped to like uh the starting web browser, but that's edge
[2844.44 → 2850.92] these days so file explorer but I wanted file explorer okay, okay, and it should come up with that because
[2850.92 → 2854.84] explorer the web browser doesn't exist anymore so file explorer should be the first thing that comes
[2854.84 → 2863.56] up so it comes up with Microsoft Edge okay, so somebody manually intervened clearly manually intervened
[2863.56 → 2869.48] in the search results and said nope that thing that is an exact character for character match
[2870.20 → 2876.84] is not the best match it's this other thing it's this thing that we really want you to use please use it
[2876.84 → 2884.12] please use edge please use edge we're gonna we're going to re-engineer how uh open width preferences
[2884.12 → 2892.36] work to make it way harder to not use it please use it please use it I mean it's its infuriating um
[2893.16 → 2899.48] and so I guess yeah I haven't been reminded I haven't found so many things that are so much better with
[2899.48 → 2904.92] Linux as I found things that are also horrible about windows but that I just didn't really think about
[2904.92 → 2909.08] because I glide right through them like okay here's something that has bothered me on the particular
[2909.08 → 2913.32] desktop environment I'm using when you click the button that clears away all your windows and takes
[2913.32 → 2919.00] you to the desktop okay, okay when you click that it does what you would expect okay and then if you
[2919.00 → 2926.12] if you alt tab and like find something you want and click it, it brings everything back oh okay like
[2927.24 → 2934.04] who thought this was what I would want to do i just I've I've had two things so far that i actually
[2934.04 → 2942.76] liked a lot one of them was the media control area sure I've really, really like it um like
[2942.76 → 2948.36] something that I enjoy quite a bit is sometimes when you have something playing in a browser tab you
[2948.36 → 2953.80] and i both have some issues when it comes to browser tabs yes um sometimes it can be kind of
[2953.80 → 2959.40] hard to find it yeah and like if is I restored all my tabs, and then it's like buried somewhere like
[2959.40 → 2965.40] it can actually be a serious pain um and yes there's the little speaker symbol on the tab but
[2965.40 → 2971.96] yep when you're when you got a lot of tabs open it's pretty small, and you know um, so this one will
[2971.96 → 2977.64] show you the different media things that are playing in the sound control panel right, and you can just
[2977.64 → 2982.04] pause play do whatever you want individually right there that's pretty cool I really like it is also if you
[2982.04 → 2989.24] had like some native app like say shop or not Shopify Spotify yeah or one that's looking locally
[2989.24 → 2994.20] those all the controls for it would be available in there as well that's pretty cool next song pause
[2994.20 → 2999.16] everything and then the other thing that I really liked was during the installation of the operating
[2999.16 → 3007.00] system instead of like asking if the operating system can steal your data in 47 different ways yeah it
[3007.00 → 3014.44] it just had essentially a like hey if you want to do productivity things check out these apps for
[3014.44 → 3019.48] these things right if you want to play games check out these apps I like how easy it was to encrypt my
[3019.48 → 3025.16] drive that yeah and install yeah why isn't that just an installation option on Windows I mean Microsoft you're
[3025.16 → 3031.72] the only major operating system left that doesn't just have a quick and easy way to encrypt your boot
[3031.72 → 3039.80] drive when you install the operating system iOS android Linux and macOS all prompt you like right
[3039.80 → 3045.16] when you're setting them up in fact iOS and android it's encrypted by default now like it's its ridiculous
[3045.16 → 3052.84] now my um volume uh panel is not as good as yours I think uh i I noticed a problem with it almost
[3052.84 → 3058.20] immediately because I have so many audio devices on my computer yeah um that when I went to scroll
[3058.20 → 3063.00] through them with my mouse wheel because the indicator to move it manually is like this little
[3063.00 → 3071.40] tiny thing uh I started immediately moving the sliders, so the scroll wheel does both yeah move
[3071.40 → 3077.16] like tilting or not tilting but like rolling through all the uh interfaces and also adjusting the sliders
[3077.16 → 3081.40] so it's like impossible to use our layouts are so different that wouldn't even be possible on mine
[3081.40 → 3087.64] i the thing that I really liked really liked yeah about that like they was a slideshow
[3088.36 → 3090.44] essentially a suggestion slideshow yeah is
[3094.04 → 3099.32] the new user experience there is so strong because if i'm genuinely a fresh user to Linux
[3099.32 → 3104.52] yeah I probably did some amount of research yeah or not what if you just want to play video games you
[3104.52 → 3108.92] also might have done none right you don't want to pay for windows unless it's that simple i actually
[3108.92 → 3118.52] really like a lot of them, but the application names are often quite different yeah i uh I wanted to
[3118.52 → 3125.00] open something, and it's like would you like to use Kate yeah and I'm like what is Kate yeah like I have
[3125.00 → 3129.32] to i had to google it yeah on Windows it's like would you like to use notepad don't pay that's pretty
[3129.32 → 3134.44] self-explanatory really straightforward yeah, yeah so what i really liked about that yeah was it
[3134.44 → 3139.16] went through basically all the standard things that you'd use your computer for yeah, and it gave
[3139.16 → 3145.40] you like these are I don't know not necessarily the best but in a lot of situations pre-installed
[3145.40 → 3151.48] options or very easy to acquire and use things that you can do yeah to get this really genuinely
[3151.48 → 3156.60] wide range of things done right I actually thought that was awesome because if I was a new user I would
[3156.60 → 3162.84] have very likely either written that down or taken pictures um but like been way more prepared
[3162.84 → 3167.56] genuinely way more prepared to actually use Linux than I would have before that slideshow
[3168.44 → 3173.72] float plane chats freaking out they figured out what desktop environment I'm in well guys wait for the
[3173.72 → 3179.48] video because there's definitely still going to be surprises Luke actually knows one of the surprises
[3179.48 → 3184.36] that is going to be in the video because I couldn't help it I was like messaging him at midnight I'm
[3184.36 → 3191.48] like have you ever seen anything this wild genuinely no actually which is pretty crazy
[3192.84 → 3198.84] it was absolutely wild okay can can we talk about Kate for a second sure because the reason I was
[3198.84 → 3203.88] using Kate was because I wanted to download a script from GitHub that I wanted to run
[3205.24 → 3210.84] can I just say for a moment that no offence development community but the fact that on GitHub
[3211.40 → 3218.52] a script doesn't just download in a text format is the stupidest thing I have ever seen
[3218.52 → 3225.88] you know acquiring things off of GitHub is a little weird it's actually brain-dead yeah that when you
[3225.88 → 3234.44] download a script it downloads as a HTML file and then the best part is that on Linux file extensions
[3234.44 → 3241.32] don't mean file extensions mean a helpful little hint about what might be inside it
[3241.32 → 3249.00] so it's literally got a text file or like a script file I forget what the extension is extension but
[3249.00 → 3256.60] when you try to actually run the script it's like this is a HTML file I'm like why is this a HTML file
[3256.60 → 3262.84] why is it that the way that I acquire this script is to copy and paste it into Kate and then save it as that
[3262.84 → 3269.00] extension and then run it why is it so ass backwards everyone's calling you stupid because you didn't click
[3269.00 → 3274.84] get raw um, but it's its just it's one of those things that are it's just it's an it's a user
[3274.84 → 3280.84] experience thing right like if is you're is you're used if you're very used to GitHub yeah it's not a
[3280.84 → 3286.28] big deal but if you're is you're a new user to GitHub it is genuinely an odd experience to
[3287.00 → 3295.24] get things from GitHub it is oh that's great so here, here okay so here okay, so raw do I still have
[3295.24 → 3302.12] to copy and paste it what are you talking about unless you write I guess you could right-click and right
[3302.12 → 3309.16] click and save link as safe link as sh file okay is that going to be a proper script or is that just
[3309.16 → 3313.08] going to be another HTML file a long time but I think it should be okay yeah I don't know i for i
[3313.08 → 3320.44] forget how I ended up actually downloading it um people are saying like or curl w get the link etc
[3320.44 → 3326.20] yeah sure the problem with a lot of this stuff is you have to know yes you have to already know
[3326.20 → 3331.72] and if you don't already know that it's not obvious a very difficult thing to get across in
[3331.72 → 3337.72] this video because a very large amount of people will just not accept that i know, and it's
[3337.72 → 3343.80] like it's like back to uh back to rich 77's comment we're here for you, we're here for you until you do
[3343.80 → 3348.68] something not exactly the way that we think you should do it but the reality of it is guys is
[3348.68 → 3354.92] developers do not get to pick how users interact with their product and there's a lot of stuff like
[3354.92 → 3360.12] I was looking up potential solutions to um a couple problems that weren't like
[3362.28 → 3367.64] it was where the user experience wasn't like kind of a hundred percent up to par with what
[3367.64 → 3371.48] I would want it wasn't that it wasn't working yeah it's that I could, I thought it could probably
[3371.48 → 3378.04] work better maybe if I did some work on it um and through googling almost all the solutions that i
[3378.04 → 3384.52] found were telling people to go it's like here's a link to the home page of the wiki for this thing
[3384.52 → 3391.88] yeah go have fun which you know what if I'm in a tinkering mindset fantastic yep but if I just want
[3391.88 → 3397.88] to play my video game right now not fantastic not great uh well this was a perfect one uh I found
[3397.88 → 3406.52] a guide for how to fix something, and it was like okay run this script like how do I run a script I have
[3406.52 → 3413.96] never I've never run a script on Linux before and yeah if I can't even manage to get a properly
[3413.96 → 3421.00] formatted script file because I keep downloading it as a HTML even though the extension
[3421.00 → 3428.92] was sh, but it wouldn't run because it was a HTML file hidden inside it that is not intuitive I mean
[3428.92 → 3436.36] it's surprising to me that engineers and like science I would think science-minded people would
[3436.36 → 3442.04] think a label should not mean what a label is how could you possibly defend that
[3443.96 → 3449.48] defend a file extension that is not descriptive of what the crap the file is I haven't experienced
[3449.48 → 3458.44] this problem so like I'm not I'm not really sure um LMAO making me facepalm there are a lot of comments
[3458.44 → 3463.08] like that there are a lot of comments that are like RTFM, and it's like yeah but the whole point of
[3463.08 → 3468.20] what we're currently analyzing is the new user experience and people don't want to have to sit
[3468.20 → 3475.16] down and bust out the manual when they use a new thing yeah, and it's way better these days sure even
[3475.16 → 3481.00] compared to I think the last time that i ran Linux seriously was probably four years ago yeah
[3481.72 → 3489.08] it's already way better and like i I genuinely think that uh at least the distro that I'm using
[3489.72 → 3495.88] is outpacing what I think windows is currently doing i I genuinely think that I think they're moving
[3495.88 → 3500.76] faster I think they're they're gaining features faster I think they're they're they're on a really
[3500.76 → 3506.60] good pace but in terms of user experience especially new user experience they are definitely
[3506.60 → 3512.28] clearly behind hyper crusher says that's user error for not knowing how to use GitHub no it's not
[3513.32 → 3520.20] it's absolutely not believe it or not believe it or not there's a whole wide world of people out there
[3520.20 → 3525.40] that have trouble figuring out where to find the photo they just took on their iPhone let alone how to
[3525.40 → 3531.32] use GitHub and as long as you hold on to that mentality that those people should just learn
[3531.32 → 3537.16] better Linux adoption is going to be very, very difficult and out of reach that's just the cold
[3537.16 → 3542.36] hard truth, and you cannot like it, and you can sit and be angry about it or whatever but that that's it
[3542.36 → 3547.96] that's it the truth just doesn't it is what it is, and you can accept it you cannot accept if it's that
[3547.96 → 3555.16] simple and there can always be distros that are distros and desktop environments whatever that are
[3555.16 → 3561.72] much more noob friendly and ones that are really hardcore like i think a uh pretty genuine
[3561.72 → 3566.60] user error would be to like oh I've never used Linux before and I'm not even very familiar with
[3566.60 → 3571.88] computers at all I'm going to go to arch like the whole internet did not tell you to do that no nobody
[3571.88 → 3577.08] told you one extremely simple google search would have told you to specifically not do that yeah so like
[3577.08 → 3583.96] sure figure it out, but there are desktop environments and distros etc that advertise
[3583.96 → 3588.36] themselves as user-friendly, and they're getting a lot better and in a lot of ways they are but
[3588.36 → 3592.84] they're not a hundred percent yeah gremlin injector put it really well people are missing this uh normal
[3592.84 → 3601.24] users are not technical yeah file extensions already are a pretty technical concept for most people I mean
[3601.96 → 3606.92] here this is actually a really uh this is kind of going to put us on a bit of a tangent here
[3606.92 → 3613.96] but I was reading an interesting article where a professor was not complaining but noticing um
[3614.52 → 3620.36] talking about opening up a discussion about that many of the students coming through their classes
[3620.36 → 3624.92] were not familiar with the concept of a folder structure like a folder tree
[3624.92 → 3631.72] and i kind of i kind of went what I mean this is a generation of people that have spent their
[3631.72 → 3638.44] yeah they've grown up their whole lives surrounded by electronics uh how and computers how is it that
[3638.44 → 3644.92] they could powerful search exactly uh but even so you can sit there and be
[3644.92 → 3651.40] elitist and go not knowing how to use GitHub is user error, or you can recognize that these are this and
[3651.40 → 3656.60] we're talking these are people in university, and again you can go well just because someone's in
[3656.60 → 3662.52] university doesn't mean that they're more educated well actually it means that statistically speaking
[3662.52 → 3668.52] they are probably more educated than the people who are not maybe just not in this particular maybe
[3668.52 → 3673.00] not in this particular way believe it or not there's a whole wide world out there of other things that
[3673.00 → 3680.68] people spend their time and energy on what right I know it's crazy right and so it's not that
[3680.68 → 3688.04] mind-blowing even though for me, it was this utterly alien concept for someone to not actually have a
[3688.04 → 3694.36] very good understanding of the folder structure because even the fact like it reminds me of how you
[3694.36 → 3698.36] know there's that anecdote that's been floating around who knows if it's actually true where the kid
[3698.36 → 3704.60] asks their dad why they have a 3d printed save button you know when they find a floppy disk right
[3705.24 → 3715.16] the very concept of a folder structure is archaic when's the last time you had a folder inside nested
[3715.16 → 3722.68] inside a folder with a bunch of files in it right like that that's very 1980s that's that's that's uh
[3722.68 → 3731.24] that's a four that is 40 years ago right when that that idea of paper filing just being a fact of life
[3731.24 → 3737.16] that everyone is familiar with was a thing I mean when I was a kid we still had uh phone numbers were
[3737.16 → 3744.44] still kept in a Rolodex right yeah and so this concept this tack tactile experience of
[3745.16 → 3749.88] rifling through things to find things that you were looking for was very much a part of my childhood but
[3749.88 → 3756.36] we've got an entire generation of people that just search for stuff yep, and you don't get to pick
[3757.00 → 3764.04] how the world uses things I think a perfect example here is tarfif101 on float plane said
[3764.52 → 3768.92] uh, and he's talking about GitHub yeah he said no it really is user error because there is and then in
[3768.92 → 3773.56] all capitals no download button for individual files you just did some really weird special stuff
[3773.56 → 3778.52] like probably saving the entire web page which is just as dumb as saving a YouTube page to try to get the
[3778.52 → 3786.28] video a few messages further down fern 182 I'm a developer and the whole save link as on GitHub and
[3786.28 → 3791.48] then getting the HTML inside what I thought was the actual thing I was trying to download happened
[3791.48 → 3797.32] to me way more times than I'm willing to admit of course it did it's just weird it's not a fantastic
[3797.32 → 3802.84] user experience it's not acquiring things off of GitHub is weird I couldn't find a download button so my
[3802.84 → 3809.24] natural work around was safe link as no I didn't save the entire web page why would how would I even
[3809.24 → 3816.60] do that we're talking about mistakes that uh a technical but not developer person could make I don't
[3816.60 → 3824.84] think most people are trying to download the entire web page they're not uh but right click save link as
[3824.84 → 3831.56] is a pretty decent work around when for whatever reason you can't find the working download button or
[3831.56 → 3837.16] or like downloads not working or you want it to go faster uh and there's like a delay if you like
[3837.16 → 3841.48] click through it's a site you use all the time, and they have one of those like five four three two one
[3841.48 → 3845.48] things like there it's just it's a workaround that people might be expected to be familiar with
[3845.48 → 3851.32] so he then replies to us saying this, but that's how browsers work not how GitHub works
[3852.36 → 3857.72] examine all the comments around your message yeah that's that's the way I'm going to answer that you've
[3857.72 → 3862.60] been you've been roasted as much as you need to be roasted you're you're you're you're cooked enough
[3862.60 → 3868.52] we go any further and uh yeah we're good that that turkey's going to be burned not uh not juicy anymore
[3868.52 → 3873.56] the answer is added a download button the answer is why isn't there a download button and why wasn't
[3873.56 → 3879.96] there a download button many years ago that's the answer way more obvious yeah oh man anyway it's
[3879.96 → 3886.28] mind-blowing we should probably uh mind blow talking about some sponsors real quick uh but
[3886.28 → 3892.60] just hilariously vindicating that I talk about all these reactions that we're going to get from the Linux
[3892.60 → 3899.32] community, and we've got a lot of people saying no, no no, no it'll be fine it'll be fine and the second
[3899.32 → 3906.12] I come out and be a human be vulnerable and say I didn't know something and that I made a mistake
[3906.12 → 3916.12] you've got these toxic members of this community jumping down my throat like ready to pounce
[3916.12 → 3921.72] and it's like I get it I get it you're an expert, and you feel like everyone should be an expert in
[3921.72 → 3928.36] this might be your baby yeah sure your baby isn't perfect, but the thing is like I don't know man see
[3928.36 → 3932.92] for me and this is you know we're getting into like relationships again right like where we I think
[3932.92 → 3937.64] we've talked about this on the show today it's like I never tell my wife you're the most beautiful
[3937.64 → 3942.76] woman in the world lots of husbands tell their wives that and I'm sitting here going well I'm not
[3942.76 → 3948.84] going to lie to you like you're not I'm also not the best looking guy in the world don't have the biggest
[3948.84 → 3955.24] long like so what the package you're Asian you don't even need me to have the biggest
[3955.24 → 3965.08] job okay that's not the fitment is fantastic yeah see right the margins here are amazing what I'll
[3965.08 → 3975.00] say is it seems like we were built for each other, so the point is the point is that if you love
[3975.00 → 3982.04] something I feel like you should be able to be honest with it that's and I think that the kind
[3982.04 → 3990.28] of love that is fanatical that is not objective is not actually as um it's not actually as fulfilling
[3990.28 → 3995.40] like I was reading an article about like 17 things a boss should never say to an employee and one of
[3995.40 → 4000.84] them was good job and there's a reason for that and the justification for it was actually very well
[4000.84 → 4006.12] thought out it's because it's not specific it's vague what was good what was good about it how
[4006.12 → 4011.32] good was it is doesn't tell you anything good job, but you have to follow it with why there has to be
[4011.32 → 4018.04] context there has to be context so you you you can't there's no point lying to people and if you
[4018.04 → 4025.64] just say everything is great your words mean nothing you lose all the gravity that the sentiments you
[4025.64 → 4032.44] express could have possibly had if you just constantly talk about how great something is and i I get I take a
[4032.44 → 4038.52] lot of flack for being super negative you know like I'll see people oh Linus complains about everything but
[4038.52 → 4046.92] but so what we also don't yeah well that's a whole that's a whole separate that's a whole separate
[4046.92 → 4051.40] conversation I mean and a lot of the time when I complain about something it's just the thing that
[4051.40 → 4055.48] makes me furious it's not when something is bad the thing that makes me angry is when something
[4055.48 → 4062.20] is bad out of complete and utter negligence or malice so the fact that the iPhone doesn't have t9 dialling
[4062.20 → 4066.60] when it's literally something that an Apple developer could build in less than a week and would require
[4068.52 → 4076.52] it's its it's an insult to their users like it's just if it's utterly unbelievable um I think there's
[4076.52 → 4082.44] also I think there's a lot of if you aren't just lying all the time or saying things that you're
[4082.44 → 4090.36] entirely unqualified to say like if you had truly done an assessment of all like appropriate aged
[4090.36 → 4096.36] partners that you could have in the world that would be ridiculous and i probably not an attractive
[4096.36 → 4100.52] trait for a woman I was just going to say she might not even want to be with you yeah I tried out i
[4100.52 → 4106.52] tried out every lady in our geographical area, and you're the best no you said world this would be a
[4106.52 → 4112.76] big project yeah a big project major um like man you'd need to drink a lot of fluids get a lot of
[4112.76 → 4118.84] chicken soup going this is a is a weird topic to go to yeah it's a weird wans ha um but i I think if
[4118.84 → 4127.00] you if you focus on things that are true, and you can fully qualify they mean more because there's that
[4127.00 → 4134.60] whole concept where like oh like you ask your your your partner if you like look good in something and
[4134.60 → 4142.12] then they say yes, and you go, and you go ask like your buddy because you might get a're worried that
[4142.12 → 4148.60] the response from your partner is is is coloured right yep it's its rose-tinted glasses whatever
[4148.60 → 4154.28] so if you are more straight up honest and clear and objective then those compliments mean
[4154.28 → 4159.24] more because you know they're legit I think there's value to that for better for worse my wife knows
[4159.24 → 4165.00] that if she makes food that isn't very good tasting I'll tell her because she's the kind of
[4165.00 → 4170.44] person who genuinely cares about self-improvement and in the same way if i she probably doesn't want to
[4170.44 → 4174.76] waste her time if she's cooking food for you if you don't want to cook something that if I set up
[4174.76 → 4180.52] I mean okay so hopefully so let's talk about one of my jobs around the house if I set up the uh you
[4180.52 → 4187.56] know the uh the universal remote for our media system, and it's in a way that she can't, it's annoying
[4187.56 → 4192.68] like it's annoying to use, or it takes too long or whatever else she's not going to just you know grin
[4192.68 → 4198.12] and bear it quietly exactly she's going to tell me so that I can fix it because we want to improve
[4198.12 → 4201.88] each other's lives more overall and deeper appreciation we're in it to win it right like
[4201.88 → 4206.12] we're on the same team um so you have to be able to be you have to be able to be honest with each
[4206.12 → 4213.40] other Luke please don't make this worse sorry dude this is so this is so great nh4x4 tracker says most
[4213.40 → 4218.36] people don't care about t9 here's another comment a little bit further down thorium220 says I started
[4218.36 → 4224.36] using t9 dialling on android because Linus mentioned it in a video thanks mate this is great most people don't
[4224.36 → 4230.36] understand what it is that's why they don't think it's amazing that is the only reason to not think
[4230.36 → 4236.52] it's amazing it is actually the fastest way to dial a phone number hands down other than if you have your
[4236.52 → 4240.92] your nine favourites or whatever, and you just hold one button that is the only way that I can think of
[4240.92 → 4250.68] that could be faster just makes me very very angry um that's not the best example of
[4250.68 → 4255.56] something that is just sort of utter negligence that it's not included I think probably a better
[4255.56 → 4261.80] example would be something like uh accessibility and right to repair like hiding screws under a
[4261.80 → 4270.04] sticker that is destroyed when you remove it over nothing over absolutely nothing uh is far more
[4270.04 → 4275.64] um hostile to the user than not having a feature that I personally think is great and so do a lot of
[4275.64 → 4280.92] people let's go ahead and get into our next sponsor here I swear to you, I'm gonna I'm going to get through

[4356.52 → 4360.12] forward slash when and you can get 10 off today
[4362.60 → 4366.28] what else do we want to talk about today I feel like we got a little bit derailed there's someone
[4366.28 → 4372.76] in the float plane chat asking for help finding a file uh in Ubuntu gnome file explorer I find that
[4373.88 → 4381.88] very funny um but let's let's continue uh good guy Microsoft lets uh funny timing for that topic
[4381.88 → 4386.28] what Microsoft sorry Microsoft oh yeah sure Microsoft agrees to independent third-party
[4386.28 → 4391.80] study looking at right to repair uh I will also point out that a lot of float plane people pointed
[4391.80 → 4397.08] out that it's very funny that one of the difficulties that you've been having with Linux is GitHub because
[4397.08 → 4403.32] Microsoft owns GitHub that is quite entertaining well okay I didn't to be clear I didn't say it was an
[4403.32 → 4408.52] issue with Linux so my issue with Linux was that it wasn't obvious where to like to put a script to run it
[4408.52 → 4416.20] right yeah like I would, you have needed that script on Windows no it's part of the experience
[4417.00 → 4423.64] okay, okay I guess that's fair I would argue like finding scripts online to do things for you is
[4423.64 → 4430.20] is probably part of the experience yeah it shouldn't be um expecting the average user to run a script i
[4430.20 → 4435.24] mean the problem with scripts is there's such an enormous like security problem too because just
[4435.24 → 4440.68] copying and pasting scripts off the internet to be clear like I'm doing it, but you shouldn't that's
[4440.68 → 4448.44] not that's not a good best practice again that's the kind of crazy sort of um I don't know what to
[4448.44 → 4457.24] call it is it doublespeak is it uh, uh it's one of the most contradictory things about uh the Linux
[4457.24 → 4462.52] community is that out of on this on the one hand it's like its open source it's all about security and
[4462.52 → 4469.16] privacy and all of this sort of pillars a lot of that is genuinely okay and on the other hand
[4469.16 → 4474.52] it's like the only way to do basic stuff is to unless you are an extremely technical user like a
[4474.52 → 4479.00] part-time developer is to download random scripts off the internet and execute them in a terminal as
[4479.00 → 4484.92] a superuser like are you serious a lot of the security stuff is that you assess that that script
[4484.92 → 4490.28] and that i know i know i know I'm just saying I'm just saying I know
[4494.04 → 4502.20] that's like saying the safest car is the one that you just build yourself like most people shouldn't
[4502.20 → 4510.44] build a car like I don't want to spoil this too much oh no but just for some contexts remember
[4510.44 → 4520.76] the screenshot I sent you no I'm sorry you're supposed to be a security professional every user
[4520.76 → 4524.28] should be a digital security professional
[4527.48 → 4535.24] oh no um they're going to hate us it's going to be a problem I'm trying honestly my experience so far has
[4535.24 → 4540.84] been pretty clean um oh my goodness remember when you were you sent me the videos of the problem yeah
[4540.84 → 4549.16] and I sent you the screenshot back um yeah yes so they're expecting you to read all that i know
[4549.16 → 4556.04] the funny part is you saw how far I scrolled through that right like there's a lot, but they're expecting
[4556.04 → 4562.04] you to read it that's like that's like literally the I forget if it made it all the way to
[4562.04 → 4568.12] the supreme court but like literally the American judicial system has decided that EULAs are not
[4568.12 → 4574.76] enforceable because nobody reads anything that long and that includes agreeing to things
[4576.68 → 4582.92] when you're executing basically any scenario a lot of people too long didn't read even if it's only a
[4582.92 → 4588.28] few lines, and sometimes it's a lot more than a few lines so I don't know anyway good guy Microsoft
[4588.28 → 4593.32] this has nothing to do with Linux uh Microsoft is taking concrete steps to facilitate independent
[4593.32 → 4599.96] repair of its devices following pressure from shareholders this comes after months of negotiations
[4599.96 → 4606.92] started in June when investor advocacy non-profit as you so filed a shareholder resolution in regard to
[4606.92 → 4613.32] right to repair and environmental concerns Microsoft will study how increasing access to parts and info can
[4613.32 → 4619.32] reduce contributions to climate change and e-waste which do I will say sound like a very new
[4619.32 → 4624.52] Microsoft thing that sounds like something new Microsoft would do so it's kind of in yeah that
[4624.52 → 4629.96] sounds like something that new Microsoft probably should have figured out in two seconds instead of
[4629.96 → 4635.00] um spending months on it and needing an independent third party commission I agree let's let's talk about
[4635.00 → 4641.72] all the wasted resources of a third party investigation being done when you could just do the right thing
[4641.72 → 4648.44] immediately but I'm sure they could figure it out I'm sure they could call lewis one time and lewis would
[4648.44 → 4653.08] happily get there like immediately and walk through how they could do all of this I'm pretty sure that they
[4653.08 → 4663.32] could sit and turn off the TV and for like four seconds sit and think, and they could probably come
[4663.32 → 4668.28] out I don't think they have to talk to lewis about this should things be easier for end users to repair
[4668.28 → 4670.36] well hold on I'm thinking
[4676.68 → 4682.44] yes yeah I did it I guess I was giving them too much credit I got there reading this line in particular
[4682.44 → 4687.88] we'll study how increasing access to parts and info can reduce contributions to climate change and e-waste
[4687.88 → 4692.84] yeah like just get over it it will do that thanks um remember this is the start increasing the
[4692.84 → 4698.28] info this is the same company for whom an fixity repairability score of two is considered a win
[4698.84 → 4705.48] okay I mean we really like the um maybe we should change it from good guy Microsoft to like hopefully
[4705.48 → 4710.92] finally getting close Microsoft it's amazing to me and I mean this is one of those funny things because
[4710.92 → 4716.20] maybe again I'm just being a right to repair elitist assuming that other people have put the kind of
[4716.20 → 4722.28] thought into this that I have, and maybe it just isn't obvious to other people how the same because
[4722.28 → 4727.64] because this this is like this is a company that's probably got uh you know pound for pound
[4727.64 → 4734.60] more genius level intellects on staff than most other almost any organization on earth other than you
[4734.60 → 4741.48] know like Mensa right like we're talking about they well you have to be a genius to be a member of Mensa don't you
[4741.48 → 4745.72] I don't know I mean I've never looked into membership I assumed I'm not genius enough the
[4745.72 → 4751.88] the point is that this is an organization that has enough smart people in it that I don't I'm not
[4751.88 → 4758.12] inclined to give a lot of uh credit for them investigating this because there's absolutely no
[4758.12 → 4763.48] way yeah sorry I changed gears here no I was trying to play devil's advocate okay it's possible that just
[4763.48 → 4768.76] because they're genius level intellects that that that doesn't mean that they've given any thought to
[4768.76 → 4774.20] this whatsoever the issue though is that companies like Microsoft and like apple are clearly putting
[4774.20 → 4781.40] so much thought into making repairs more difficult that they couldn't possibly have made those decisions
[4781.40 → 4787.96] without also examining the alternate the alternative if I can try to jump on the devil's advocate side of
[4787.96 → 4794.20] things i I could say that there's whatever start of it started it probably set a pretty significant
[4794.20 → 4801.16] amount of momentum, and it's been difficult to kind of gear change and there's been no real kick to
[4801.16 → 4806.84] actually start that gear change and then lately there's been much more of a kick well let's let's
[4806.84 → 4812.20] hope let's hope we can keep some momentum here I'm hoping that's it we have not talked about the twitch leak
[4812.20 → 4819.96] yet okay how are we this far into the show, and we have not okayed we also oh my goodness this is madness
[4819.96 → 4826.04] we haven't even talked about how toques are back in stock ladies and gentlemen we've got new colour wow
[4826.04 → 4830.52] did I make exactly the same face that looks like a palette swap look at this
[4833.00 → 4839.88] is that or is that not exactly the same picture hold on it's not the hair slightly different that is
[4839.88 → 4848.44] actually a different picture that's kind of amazing uh anyway the dark aqua is here we got gray we got a blue
[4848.44 → 4853.80] now I don't know I've ever seen any store that has as many pictures for products as the Ltd you know
[4853.80 → 4858.60] what's the crazy part about that is that it's not even that much work like it's a lot of work and it
[4858.60 → 4866.28] does cost us money, but it's not such a crazy amount of work that I think you know large organizations
[4866.28 → 4872.28] couldn't just do it a few more yeah, yeah just it doesn't seem that complicated anyway they're 1999
[4872.28 → 4878.52] the construction quality issues were fixed if you have one from last year um you will hear from us
[4878.52 → 4883.64] we'll be reaching out to all previous buyers in the next week or so, and you will either get a new
[4883.64 → 4889.48] fixed toque, or you will get a refund if you've had the issue um, and you haven't yet reached out to us so
[4889.48 → 4893.32] we'll get it all sorted out there are thousands of you please give our support team some time to work
[4893.32 → 4897.40] through everything, but we will get this resolved for everyone we take all this kind of stuff extremely
[4897.40 → 4904.68] seriously um for those of you who are wondering uh no we did not throw away the um the compromised
[4904.68 → 4911.48] inventory we actually had it reworked locally uh so we did not waste any beanies that's cool um they
[4911.48 → 4918.84] were all they were all fixed and um and then like just repacked because they're still new um cool so yeah
[4918.84 → 4924.04] we're getting we're getting everything sorted out all right let's talk about twitch leaked the
[4924.04 → 4931.00] whole thing source code uh creator compensation apparently there could be more
[4931.00 → 4936.44] coming um I saw that apparently this is part one yeah I don't I don't even like at this point no
[4937.24 → 4943.08] what else is there what else is going to be a bunch of ISOs of like people's computers i I have no idea
[4943.08 → 4949.88] uh because it's a lot it's its it's the source code it's its a lot not all but a very significant
[4949.88 → 4954.44] amount of creator compensation it I believe it goes down to like 10 000 creators or something
[4955.08 → 4959.32] it's its like one percent because there's an insane amount of twitch am I the top one percent
[4959.32 → 4963.96] then because I think my information was leaked nice I am the one percent I think that's what it is I'm
[4963.96 → 4968.60] not entirely certain I mean I became a one top one percent only fans creator in like two hours heck
[4968.60 → 4973.56] yeah that was pretty that was pretty fun just flexing nice only fans flexing sorry I got to do
[4973.56 → 4979.80] only fans flexing got to take some clothes off is the male nipple thing still a thing on twitch
[4979.80 → 4983.72] I have no idea I have no clue I'm pretty sure we've broken it like a few yeah I'd be willing to show you
[4983.72 → 4988.44] guys my nipples but I don't actually need to get banned off twitch it's yeah it's its not really a
[4988.44 → 4993.56] needle mover for us and I was going to say now everyone knows how much you make yeah yeah that could be an
[4993.56 → 4999.32] expensive nip slip yeah exactly right yeah even though it's not a needle mover it's still expensive yeah
[4999.32 → 5006.12] it goes away it's a lot better than a kick in the teeth 29 000 over two years yeah um anyway 125
[5006.12 → 5013.00] gigabytes went into the torrent link uh that was leaked onto originally 4chan along with a paste
[5013.00 → 5019.24] bin I believe the paste bin the paste bin was gone by the time I got an email from Luke at 5 30 a.m
[5020.04 → 5028.60] before you ask I've got it I've got it all I did it hot i um you did look how ready
[5029.64 → 5038.52] I have nothing I am good boy um the uh I think Jake had it before you maybe I don't know um you got
[5038.52 → 5044.92] it like I still have student nice like you have to just archive this stuff I don't know it's interesting
[5044.92 → 5051.64] I mean once it's gone you know it's someone in the flow plane chat said that like a big d move that twitch
[5051.64 → 5056.12] could and would be fascinating if they did is just go like you know what screw it just put it on
[5056.12 → 5062.28] GitHub there's no way not Amazon wouldn't happen, but it'd be sweet that's not Amazon's way yeah
[5062.28 → 5066.60] there's absolutely no way hands off desk I'm sorry get your heads out of the gutter
[5067.88 → 5071.96] I just do this when I'm sitting down I don't know why anyway muscle memory
[5075.08 → 5080.60] I was just waiting for you to bring it up again all right tell us what's in their twitch has confirmed the
[5080.60 → 5085.48] breach has taken place but denies credit card info or login details were exposed um
[5088.76 → 5094.84] I have heard that people claim that password data was included but was encrypted that doesn't mean
[5094.84 → 5098.76] that you shouldn't change your password yeah it means that you should change your password change
[5098.76 → 5104.68] your password for twitch just do it especially I mean everyone has a stream key I believe every twitch
[5104.68 → 5109.64] account is able to stream I'm pretty sure um so just make sure that you do it because you don't
[5109.64 → 5114.44] want someone getting access to your account details which could be attached to your name and your
[5114.44 → 5120.04] personal information and then streaming things on twitch that are terrible um so change it change
[5120.04 → 5127.48] your password very important um there was's yeah basically source code and user information
[5127.48 → 5133.08] passwords stuff like that and the earnings of a lot of different creators the earnings have been discussed
[5133.08 → 5139.48] a lot yeah that's basically the highlight for the armies but what do developers care about
[5139.48 → 5143.96] there's a lot of stuff in their twitch does a lot of things yeah like what lots of stuff I just want
[5143.96 → 5149.88] to know what the things the developers find interesting lots of things um there 's's if you think about
[5149.88 → 5158.12] YouTube or twitch um there are things that would be valuable to developers if they leaked out
[5158.12 → 5163.88] there are things like what the player that could be good for people I mean twitch's player is not amazing
[5163.88 → 5168.20] you might not want the player yeah, but there could be some tech in there that's interesting there's also
[5168.20 → 5173.72] like pipeline improvements in terms of moving data because one of the things especially for YouTube is
[5173.72 → 5180.52] incredibly good at this YouTube is so good at this that I've talked to people that work at competitors
[5180.52 → 5187.08] um that have said that they never want to try to get into never want to try to genuinely compete with
[5187.08 → 5191.48] YouTube in the God space like they might have God availability, but they don't want to try to compete
[5191.48 → 5199.08] with them on the God space because their like pipeline and data science essentially is so far beyond
[5199.08 → 5205.56] that they'll never get as efficient and that's the battle right um so like it's its crazy, so there's
[5206.44 → 5210.52] probably some of that stuff in there um there 's's there 's's everything there's everything
[5210.52 → 5216.04] that you would need to essentially make twitch there's also other stuff um that includes things that
[5216.04 → 5221.32] they never released including what people are talking about uh as a steam competitor called
[5221.32 → 5227.00] vapour yeah which is interested in a few different ways partially because it includes the word vape
[5227.56 → 5233.00] which is like to come on now and then the other one because it's so highly related to the word steam
[5233.00 → 5238.84] yeah which is just like really I also like that it's vaporware vapour that's pretty good
[5238.84 → 5249.08] uh apparently vapour will or was or will or I don't know have a 3d chat system called vape world
[5250.52 → 5256.20] which is like the worst thing they could have possibly called it in my opinion holy uh Amazon
[5256.20 → 5262.92] filed the patent in 2017 titled joining games from a spectating system oh that's pretty cool sounds
[5262.92 → 5269.56] actually genuinely pretty cool yeah and twitch being fully like vertically integrated so uh Amazon
[5269.56 → 5276.20] having a game studio obviously um actually imagine being able to join a battleground in new world
[5276.20 → 5284.04] yeah that you saw a streamer was in and remember this is AWS right so I would be very surprised if
[5284.04 → 5291.08] the the end game experience wasn't something along the lines of streaming the game right not
[5291.08 → 5296.84] playing on your local machine right, so the entire game runs in an Amazon data centre somewhere you
[5296.84 → 5304.28] connect to if it's this enormous high performance but fully local environment with clients streaming
[5304.28 → 5309.96] into it everyone is able to engage with like they're able to watch in any number of ways like
[5309.96 → 5316.28] imagine if you could watch a battle Royal but more like in a hum in a hunger game style where your
[5316.28 → 5320.92] camera can be anywhere right and by hunger games sorry I don't mean like the minecraft play mode
[5320.92 → 5325.80] I mean like the movies like where if you could watch an arena fight, but your camera could be
[5325.80 → 5331.40] anywhere you want like literally an unlimited practically speaking unlimited number of people
[5331.40 → 5338.52] could connect and either be playing or observing and how that would work with a platform like twitch
[5338.52 → 5344.68] like they so they've got the mechanism to draw new viewers into playing the game through drops
[5344.68 → 5349.00] and through uh you know exclusive skins, and they've got all the streamers that are going to be
[5349.00 → 5352.92] inherently promoting it because you just play whatever's biggest on the platform they can use
[5352.92 → 5358.12] the platform to push the game to boost it up, and it all runs on AWS and the whole thing is just this
[5358.12 → 5364.60] beautiful little bow I mean honestly you think about it that way and Amazon is the bigger threat to Xbox
[5364.60 → 5371.24] than Sony is because that is potentially a completely game-changing experience you look at how much demand
[5371.24 → 5380.28] there is to get into what's that stupid GTA 5 IRL like server that everyone cares about um pixel something
[5380.28 → 5385.96] something pixel something like that you look at how much demand there is to get in and
[5385.96 → 5393.00] participate in these types of uh it's not a pixel it's called like yeah no pixel type of like massively
[5393.00 → 5399.24] multiplayer but remember it's relatively small scale but this type of multiplayer experience because no pixel
[5399.24 → 5403.72] almost isn't even a game for a lot of the players they're they're role-playing right and
[5407.16 → 5412.52] I know, but we can't call it a massively multiplayer online RPG it's good new slash Linux okay because
[5412.52 → 5419.72] it's I don't think anyone's going to argue that GTA 5 is a RPG game okay so yes the nope yes you could
[5419.72 → 5427.56] there are role-playing elements but I think we can agree that it is still a shooter adventure okay whatever
[5427.56 → 5432.60] I don't know what genre Grand Theft Auto is its own genre it doesn't matter the point is the point is
[5433.16 → 5440.20] that you don't even have to pay streamers to play that they want to be in there because wherever the
[5440.20 → 5445.56] the hottest personalities are all congregating is where they're going to be able to get the most access to
[5445.56 → 5452.52] new audiences and to increase their own subscriptions so all of a sudden the play for twitch which
[5452.52 → 5460.36] clearly wasn't um motivated by twitch's spectacular profitability uh makes more sense and to be clear
[5460.36 → 5466.84] you know I'm not I'm not saying that twitch doesn't make any money I'm just saying compared to the billion
[5466.84 → 5473.96] dollars that Amazon spent on it if the revenue numbers are anywhere even close to representative
[5473.96 → 5484.28] of what twitch is making it's not very profitable that site is there 's's these like really
[5484.28 → 5492.52] bit like the brand takeovers for games are huge yep, yep big money yeah it's its they'll do like whole
[5492.52 → 5498.20] site buys and stuff like it's its big, but a whole site buys a lot of it is going to end up paid to the
[5498.20 → 5503.80] streamers on these pages those banners are showing I don't think the twitch home page is exactly
[5503.80 → 5510.36] the hottest place to hang out you go to the streamers you like to watch so I suspect so i
[5510.36 → 5514.68] would I would say, and you got to remember too so one of the one of the things that's really important
[5514.68 → 5520.84] to keep in mind is that the streamer uh income that leaked does not include donations, and it does not
[5520.84 → 5527.48] include um what was one of the other major ones that it doesn't include brand deals shoot yeah it
[5527.48 → 5531.64] doesn't include brand deals, but the point is twitched doesn't get a piece of brand deals unless they're
[5531.64 → 5538.04] acting in an in bits agency no it would probably include acting in like an and uh like an agency
[5538.04 → 5544.28] role for the streamer and even for donations if I recall correctly doesn't twitch take a lower
[5544.28 → 5550.60] cut for donations do they even take a cut for donations so they don't take donations they do bits
[5550.60 → 5557.96] twitch uh donations revenue share hold on how much does twitch take from donations subscriptions
[5557.96 → 5563.80] uh affiliates earn 50 of the sub some high-end partners keep 70 percent donations made through
[5563.80 → 5568.44] third-party companies such as stream labs go to the streamer so how does what's the share for bits
[5568.44 → 5573.56] I'm not familiar with it the point is there's a scale oh it apparently included bits so even though
[5573.56 → 5578.20] that doesn't tell us necessarily how many streamers are making ah it didn't include exclusivity contracts
[5578.20 → 5585.16] right so even though it didn't tell us how many top streamers are actually making because there could
[5585.16 → 5592.04] be donations bits whatever uh exclusivity deals brand deals all that other kind of stuff what it did tell
[5592.04 → 5599.08] us is how much twitch is making because twitch is making whatever the inverse of that number the streamers
[5599.08 → 5605.32] are making is and so if we're looking at the top streamers on the platform making like eight to nine
[5605.32 → 5612.76] million dollars over a span of it seems like about two years and then it's dropping precipitously from
[5612.76 → 5622.12] there I mean you can basically figure out how much revenue twitch has not quite there's
[5622.12 → 5628.76] also yeah so like Amazon wanted to own the tech to a certain degree and Amazon wanted to own the watch
[5628.76 → 5633.16] time watch time was particularly interesting to them and I'm sure they're taking a lot of data from
[5633.16 → 5639.08] their users as well of course it's extremely valuable to them, but there's also like AWS features
[5639.08 → 5644.76] that have come from twitch existing within the Amazon ecosystem that they then sell in that way
[5644.76 → 5648.44] like there's there are other ways that they've been able to profit off of there but yeah in terms of
[5648.44 → 5653.72] subscription revenue it is quite revealing for sure yeah I mean it's uh we're not going to build a twitch
[5653.72 → 5658.76] competitor even with the source code I can tell you we're not interested in building a twitch competitor
[5658.76 → 5665.48] already knew that yeah and yeah having the source code makes no not only would that be intensely
[5665.48 → 5672.20] not okay uh, but it makes no difference anyway so yeah I mean I think that it's actually kind of funny
[5672.20 → 5678.36] how the entire twitch source code leaked and nobody will try to clone twitch's service with their own
[5678.36 → 5685.56] source code I pretty much guarantee it because the business model unless you have those supplementary
[5685.56 → 5691.24] businesses that you can use the technology for it's just it's not practical it's really expensive
[5691.80 → 5700.28] yeah yeah there are a few things uh rip mixer right like if Microsoft with their much deeper uh
[5700.28 → 5707.16] understanding I would say even of gaming if Microsoft couldn't make that aspect of the business work
[5707.88 → 5714.52] I mean well apparently there were a lot of issues at mixer, but my point still stands it's clearly
[5714.52 → 5720.36] more of a challenge than just building a streaming platform you have to actually build a business
[5720.36 → 5726.52] around it uh EPOS Vox is in the chat said worth noting though that twitch only pays like five to
[5726.52 → 5733.72] ten percent of their ad revenue for creators it's nowhere near a 50 50 split yeah okay that's fair yeah
[5733.72 → 5738.12] most of what creators are making like if you look at your how much you're making from ads on twitch it's
[5738.12 → 5745.32] it's not it's not a lot um a lot of it's going to be subs a lot of it's also going to be donations
[5745.32 → 5750.04] donations are huge like if you thought you just learned how much these streamers are actually taking
[5750.04 → 5767.08] away you're woefully mistaken uh but I can also uh I can also tell you that ads CPMs compared to user donations is not um nothing I think ads are a very small part of this yeah ads are yeah
[5767.08 → 5774.84] ads are not going to be a the game changer that you might think that they would be remembered like
[5774.84 → 5783.08] website banner ads are sort of that's a pretty web 1.0 way to make money now twitch because they've got
[5783.08 → 5789.48] this super dialled in audience is going to be able to demand more than some random and twitch also facilitates
[5789.48 → 5796.04] a lot of like okays like every major fps player is going to play this new game that came out we're going to be
[5796.04 → 5800.36] the in-between between you and all these streamers yeah, and it's going to be this huge absolutely
[5800.36 → 5805.72] genuinely massive amounts of money transferring hands yes um because they're buying out like I said
[5805.72 → 5811.32] like every major gamer yeah even non-fps gamers like everyone on twitch is going to be playing I think apex
[5811.32 → 5814.92] was one of them right there's been a lot of games that are like that that had like essentially no
[5814.92 → 5820.04] marketing but on launch dates like every twitch person is playing it yeah, and you know they're paid to
[5820.04 → 5824.28] play it because they're like we're going to be playing this game from exactly this time to exactly this time
[5824.28 → 5830.44] and then going back to regular content it's like oh okay um widget says Microsoft understands gaming
[5831.88 → 5840.04] Microsoft owns Xbox box yeah Microsoft pioneered cross-platform licenses for games that's that's a
[5840.04 → 5844.12] pretty understands gamers and understands gaming move right there yeah they don't get everything right
[5844.12 → 5850.20] 100 definitely not, but they're they're definitely not complete idiots when it comes to
[5850.20 → 5857.40] engaging with the gaming community nope that's uh that's Xbox One launch Microsoft that Microsoft is
[5857.40 → 5864.76] gone it's a media you want to watch football it's like you're going to play games like this connect
[5866.44 → 5873.56] that was an entertaining launch oh yeah pat hartal says Microsoft developed direct x LMAO
[5873.56 → 5879.88] yeah they know a thing or two they because they've seen her thing a thing or two yeah they've
[5879.88 → 5884.44] been around they've been around the block um speaking of a group that's been around the block
[5884.44 → 5889.16] Facebook had a bit of a bad week oh are we going to talk about that uh we don't talk about it for too
[5889.16 → 5892.84] long yeah sure let's go fast because there are a couple of things that i still want to talk
[5892.84 → 5897.32] about OLED switch and my team viewer saga okay we can go over this really quick they were down for i
[5897.32 → 5902.84] think it was like six hours uh publications estimated Facebook lost somewhere between 60 and 100 million
[5903.56 → 5909.40] the outage epic um what was really great so like WhatsApp Instagram Facebook all of it was down
[5909.96 → 5915.08] building access was also down because it's tied into the Facebook platform so they couldn't get
[5915.08 → 5922.20] back in to like to fix it I have heard i that's like verified this but I have heard that they had to like
[5922.20 → 5928.44] contact someone who had an angle grinder to like to cut them into the building so they could fix it
[5928.44 → 5933.32] hilarious which is amazing that's all we don't even have to go into it way more than that but just like
[5933.32 → 5939.64] so funny um all right I want to talk about the OLED switch okay have you seen it in person yet no
[5940.44 → 5945.72] it's that even been possible didn't you guys get like a no we didn't get an early unit I think
[5945.72 → 5952.92] it's like on store shelves right now oh okay yeah love you Nintendo but you do a lot of things weird
[5953.48 → 5958.60] um they tried to work with us for a little bit there yeah no they did get one from Nintendo oh just
[5958.60 → 5965.08] just like like a week and a half after like Austin uploaded his video I'm like nice okay
[5965.08 → 5970.20] sweet I mean you know what honestly I can see why console makers do prioritize him he hits
[5970.76 → 5976.60] oh no he does a great consoles yeah um but I actually don't think that was like an organized
[5976.60 → 5978.84] strategy I think it was just Nintendo being
[5978.84 → 5987.88] just being Nintendo a little bit yeah um so I tried it the bigger screen so much better like
[5987.88 → 5994.12] actually uh like I'm looking at it going I haven't touched breath of the wild since I beat it I'm like
[5994.92 → 6000.20] I need to jump back into I need to jump back into rule here I'm gonna yeah I'm going to play some more
[6000.20 → 6006.44] breath of the wild um definitely I didn't try the new metro id game but I'm definitely going to play it
[6006.44 → 6013.88] I've got a code in my inbox so I'll check that out and I had a lot of concerns about blowing up the
[6013.88 → 6019.88] size of the screen while maintaining 720p resolution I shouldn't say a lot of concerns I had some concerns
[6020.60 → 6030.28] it's okay it's okay it's okay it's fine I am disappointed surprised it's its like I know you're
[6030.28 → 6034.44] saying it's okay but I'm surprised it's that bad I thought it was honestly going to make not much of a
[6034.44 → 6037.96] difference it's not that bad okay well the thing is it doesn't make a huge difference it's just that
[6037.96 → 6043.64] if you have sharp eyes you probably already weren't a huge fan of the 720p display yeah and the good news
[6043.64 → 6053.48] is that it's 720p RGB not gentile so if it was 720p but a gentile sub-pixel arrangement i i I was
[6053.48 → 6062.76] concerned about that, but it's a RGB OLED panel, and it looks pretty darn good um the biggest disappointment
[6062.76 → 6069.00] for me, I think is that the rumoured technology they're working on with NVIDIA to use DSS like
[6069.00 → 6077.16] to use machine learning upscaling did not make it into this model what I wonder is if the rumoured
[6077.16 → 6084.52] switch pro just isn't this if this is the new base model they upgraded it in some way so that they
[6084.52 → 6089.08] could do a pricing adjustment because the cost difference between the OLED panel and the old one
[6089.08 → 6094.52] is not 50 so they're basically just jacking up the price of the regular switch, and maybe we're
[6094.52 → 6101.72] still going to get a switch pro that's that's kind of what I'm wondering i I have obviously it's cool
[6101.72 → 6108.52] be great to have one I have been not interested in purchasing one at all at any point because of
[6108.52 → 6114.44] essentially that I bought it not only is the I'm sure that's fine yeah not only is the steam deck
[6114.44 → 6121.08] coming and that was kind of my big purchase as of late yeah um that's a big purchase but
[6122.76 → 6128.92] i just i I can't shake the idea that not only is my current one fine, but there's probably another one
[6128.92 → 6134.68] coming yeah i i i kind of suspect that there's another one coming because if you're Nintendo you're
[6134.68 → 6139.96] all about charging a lot of money for things and the oh yeah the switch is like a 300 console
[6139.96 → 6148.04] is it 300 or 250 in the U.S. I can't remember bestbuy.com the United States I typed in dot com didn't
[6148.04 → 6161.24] I okay Nintendo Switch 339 339 that's got to be a Canadian price yeah it's 299 299 in the U.S. so the
[6161.24 → 6167.16] OLED model is 349 did I get now if I'm Nintendo why don't I want a piece of that 500 console pie
[6167.16 → 6172.36] that's where the switch pro would come in and maybe it doesn't maybe you can't take
[6172.36 → 6176.12] it with you, I don't know maybe it's dock only i have no idea what could be coming but
[6176.12 → 6183.64] with 8k TVs out now and 4k TVs basically mainstream for anyone outside the very, very bottom level of
[6183.64 → 6189.96] budgets i I think it's they can't ignore it forever I mean Nintendo really does try boy do they ever make
[6189.96 → 6195.56] a solid effort to ignore technological advancements forever but uh i think they I think they're
[6195.56 → 6199.88] going to do something they're going to do something now I want to talk about my team viewer update
[6200.84 → 6208.04] I tweeted yeah I enjoyed this tweet I'm actually excited to see what happened I tweeted out of anger
[6208.04 → 6214.36] because something that I was doing related to the Linux challenge was I wanted to set up what did I want
[6214.36 → 6223.96] to set up I wanted to know if a parsec would be a viable way for me to enjoy games that i absolutely
[6223.96 → 6229.00] couldn't play on Linux I would understand that that's a total hack because not everyone has two
[6229.00 → 6236.04] computers one that they can remote into uh but I wanted to know if is parsec would be a viable way
[6236.04 → 6243.80] for me to play a game that is not like uh is completely unplayable and i I didn't even know if
[6243.80 → 6249.72] parsec had a client and so what I wanted to do was I wanted to set up my work machine with parsec which i
[6249.72 → 6254.44] hadn't before I just have it on my home machine I wanted to install parsec on my work machine so that
[6254.44 → 6259.24] I could like to try it so that I could install a client on my Linux machine at home and I like try to do
[6259.24 → 6264.20] that because it's just you want to talk about uh you know streaming game streaming is part of the gaming
[6265.00 → 6270.76] experience now it's its a chance it's something you can do so I wanted to try it anyway I had to use
[6270.76 → 6277.48] team viewer to get into my work machine because that's how I access it and the only reason I had opened it
[6277.48 → 6285.80] it all was so that I could install parsec I get this I get this pop-up, and you need a little bit
[6285.80 → 6293.88] of backstory for why this pop-up is such a big deal tell us what you'll pay oh wow this is told us what
[6293.88 → 6304.60] you'll pay for a subscription and stretch the rest of your 2021 budget contact us okay let's break this
[6304.60 → 6312.36] down I have a perpetual license for team viewer 2012 I paid I forget, but it was more than five
[6312.36 → 6318.84] thousand dollars for the bare minimum number of seats that I needed because at the time we were using
[6318.84 → 6324.36] team viewer to remote into an android device that was holding all of our two-factor authentication I'm
[6324.36 → 6329.40] comfortable talking about this now because we're actually doing things a different way now, and it's
[6329.40 → 6334.52] better yeah it's its it's better it's more secure and uh we're not going to talk about it because
[6334.52 → 6339.00] security through obscurity hopefully knock on wood, but the point is that's what we were doing then so
[6339.00 → 6342.52] we had just had an android phone that was plugged in all the time went through a couple of them before
[6342.52 → 6347.56] we uh removed the battery on one before plugging it in all the time that was a good uh it was a good
[6347.56 → 6351.64] moment i I just thought they would have better battery management yeah I thought they wouldn't just
[6351.64 → 6358.28] blow up in like four months we had two of them do that yeah anyway yeah the point is um we used team viewer
[6358.28 → 6363.24] was one of the few solutions in fact I think it might have been the only solution that was truly
[6363.24 → 6369.72] cross-platform where you could remote into an android device from a pc or mac and remote into a pc or mac
[6369.72 → 6378.36] from an android device and everything worked cross-platform so I was like okay this is a lot of money
[6378.36 → 6385.56] but it's a perpetual license no problem now with that I think the next revision of team viewer they
[6385.56 → 6393.00] switched to a subscription model and completely discontinued the chance of buying a perpetual
[6393.00 → 6399.72] license of team viewer now funny thing because they didn't want to have to maintain two different
[6399.72 → 6409.00] versions of the app on mobile devices a legacy one and a subscription one your old legacy perpetual license
[6409.00 → 6415.16] for desktop gets you the latest version of the mobile app okay because and that was just that was
[6415.16 → 6419.08] a cost-saving measure that wasn't because they were trying to be good guys, but you know what a nightmare
[6419.08 → 6424.84] it is maintaining a mobile app it sucks yeah it's it sucks developers are expensive and so they were
[6424.84 → 6430.04] just like okay forget it so on the mobile side you'll just get the latest one so right around that time
[6430.04 → 6439.00] team viewer since then has semi-regularly reached out to me over every possible means of communication
[6439.00 → 6444.76] they have emailed me they have popped up annoying messages like this in my software that I paid for
[6444.76 → 6451.56] they have even called me at unreasonable times in the morning because they don't think maybe I'm on the
[6451.56 → 6459.64] west coast and I am not awake yet at 6 a.m my time they have called me completely stupid times of day
[6459.64 → 6467.16] to ask me to upgrade to a subscription version of team viewer and my answer every single time every
[6467.16 → 6474.92] single time has been no and do not contact me about this again because I have exactly the functionality
[6474.92 → 6481.00] I need from team viewer and there's nothing that you can offer me that would make me upgrade from the
[6481.00 → 6487.48] version that I'm using yeah all I need it for is we use it for um script remote script review for
[6487.48 → 6491.80] example like John's based down in North Carolina so team viewer is a nice way for us to both we
[6491.80 → 6496.68] actually both remote into the same VM that's running on the server here so that it has access to all the
[6496.68 → 6501.96] local resources that he works on, and then we can both edit and stuff so it does have a purpose
[6501.96 → 6509.56] it's a good tool um it's a useful tool it's a useful tool but I can already do that it does absolutely
[6509.56 → 6516.28] everything that I need it to do and so i basically finally got frustrated because I was like I don't
[6516.28 → 6520.52] even want to use your software right now I'm just using your software to install some other software
[6520.52 → 6524.44] so I send out this tweet I'm just like I was just kind of irate because I've been troubleshooting
[6524.44 → 6530.12] a bunch of stuff I'm working on the Linux challenge zero dollars you vampires I paid for an effing
[6530.12 → 6534.92] perpetual license of team viewer 12 stop emailing me stop calling me at eastern time o'clock in the
[6534.92 → 6541.00] morning and stop popping up this crap when I use the software I paid thousands of dollars for I tagged them
[6541.00 → 6547.88] I have never seen a tweet from myself anyway I've never seen a tweet that I've sent out generate
[6547.88 → 6556.44] this much animosity toward the subject of the tweet it appears as though absolutely everyone hates team
[6556.44 → 6562.12] viewer yeah and the reason for it is pretty apparent because even the users who said hey why don't you
[6562.12 → 6567.00] just click oh you guys can't really see this but um oh this is not a touch screen uh whatever there's a
[6567.00 → 6573.72] little thing down here that says don't show this message again I was not the only one who noticed
[6573.72 → 6577.80] this and so a lot of people were like well why don't you just click that and the answer is because
[6577.80 → 6583.56] it doesn't actually work that's why I'm so mad because I tell them don't call me again and they
[6583.56 → 6588.84] call me again I tell them don't email me again, and they email me again I click don't show this message
[6588.84 → 6595.80] again, and they show the message again it's extraordinarily frustrating they show like a slightly different
[6595.80 → 6602.44] version or something so team viewer replied to my tweet team viewer support got back
[6602.44 → 6609.08] to me look at this look at this at Linus g Sebastian hi we apologize for the trouble with the pop-up the
[6609.08 → 6615.64] self-opt-out is available for licensed customers options advanced show advanced options under team
[6615.64 → 6621.64] viewer options deselect the box for in-product marketing messages okay I hope this will help you
[6621.64 → 6629.72] all right I replied to team viewer and this I didn't I didn't send out a full tweet like i just
[6629.72 → 6635.40] replied to them, so probably most people haven't seen the best part of the saga it was like five
[6635.40 → 6639.64] grand or something can't remember it was a lot oh no this is replying to someone else here that's
[6639.64 → 6645.88] right proper tweet how about no pop-up why would I buy a subscription for something I own a perpetual
[6645.88 → 6651.88] license for maybe because I hate money let's play a game I'm going to click don't show this again and go
[6651.88 → 6660.52] see if that box is ticked oh wait it's not even there what it is not it is not there in the place
[6660.52 → 6669.72] that they told me it is because that button only exists in the subscription versions of team viewer
[6669.72 → 6683.24] oh my goodness major egg on their face big egg did they respond at all big okay so get this
[6683.24 → 6689.88] they do not reply to this tweet yeah of course not because brutal they got raced this is like about the
[6689.88 → 6696.12] hardest I've seen someone get radioed in a while they got radioed super hard here did not reply because
[6696.12 → 6700.76] I'm sure I'm sure they had meetings like it's not it wouldn't be the first time that I complained
[6700.76 → 6705.72] about something, and it generated meetings at a company being like how do we make this go away
[6705.72 → 6712.84] as fast as possible so I got a call um it did wake me up this morning I was going to say was it early in
[6712.84 → 6717.40] the morning it wasn't that early I should have been I should have been up already anyway it was at like
[6717.40 → 6722.68] nine um and I ended up being late for work today so you know thanks team viewer thank you for the wake-up
[6722.68 → 6732.20] call the point is I got a call this morning, and they said hey sorry about that we have uh we have
[6732.20 → 6742.12] marked your account to not get any of these messages any more here is my response team viewer wrong answer
[6742.12 → 6749.80] yeah because the right answer was not to appease the influencer so that they don't complain about you
[6749.80 → 6758.76] publicly the right answer is to tell me we have stopped doing this for everyone who has a perpetual
[6758.76 → 6765.16] team viewer license we have stopped harassing our customers who already gave us their money because
[6765.16 → 6773.72] they didn't give us enough money, yet that is the correct answer it shouldn't be me and also I have told
[6773.72 → 6781.24] you to put me on that list and until you knew who I was you didn't do it which is the wrong answer so
[6781.24 → 6787.80] now I know for a fact the list does exist yeah and that when you tell them not to put you on the list
[6787.80 → 6794.12] and you don't happen to be a YouTuber they just don't bother can you go after them for can span because of
[6794.12 → 6801.48] that probably, but it's not worth the effort yeah someone could though so I'm sure you thought that you
[6801.48 → 6806.60] were making me happy but what you actually did was demonstrate how terrible your business practices
[6806.60 → 6812.20] are for everyone else way to go team viewer treating me special is just another way of saying that you
[6812.20 → 6817.24] don't treat your customers like you should yeah because if you know it's the right thing to do and
[6817.24 → 6825.32] you'll do it for me then you should automatically do it for everyone that simple yeah so eat a dick team
[6825.32 → 6830.12] viewer this segment needs to be clipped and shared all over it probably will be there's a YouTube channel
[6830.12 → 6835.64] called leg clips yeah it's actually fantastic we'll email you and tell you about it and I'm
[6835.64 → 6842.04] we'll call you in the morning just you know you might already be subscribed to leg clips but I don't
[6842.04 → 6848.76] know if you're a member um so you know yeah uh this is great Linus where's the framework uh Jake told
[6848.76 → 6854.28] me I'm not allowed to use my daily driver lap shop laptop on when show because I'll leak things
[6854.28 → 6860.92] yeah so I agreed with him that was good he made a good call Jake, and so I'm not using my
[6860.92 → 6864.92] daily driver laptop honestly though we should just we should just both use frameworks on the lap on the
[6864.92 → 6869.80] wan show that'd be sweet it might not actually be the best because we need to run at standard
[6869.80 → 6876.44] resolutions for capture you know for our screens here and that display is gonna probably look
[6876.44 → 6883.00] a little interpolated because it runs at a weirdo like um two by three resolution or something like that
[6883.00 → 6887.24] so it might not be it might not actually be the best for what we're doing, but that doesn't mean
[6887.24 → 6891.56] that you actually need the whole desktop usually you're just showing a YouTube video right
[6891.56 → 6897.40] yeah definitely grab it's more just that i uh like when you're looking at text so that you're you want
[6897.40 → 6901.32] to be running at the right native resolution, so the capture card can support it properly and so when
[6901.32 → 6904.36] you're looking at text it's going to look kind of crappy I guess it doesn't really matter oh the
[6904.36 → 6908.44] capture cards have probably got it yeah, yeah so I was going to say you can just crop it yeah love you
[6908.44 → 6915.72] black magic, but also you're not perfect uh okay so I think that's pretty much everything other than
[6915.72 → 6921.64] going through some of them super chats chat I missed the first few because even though I have
[6921.64 → 6926.84] submitted a bug report for this YouTube has not fixed it so that's pretty cool hey I can share you
[6926.84 → 6933.64] guys on my super chat experience uh you're you're amazing too thanks this is a super weird way for
[6933.64 → 6945.24] this to be formatted so that's pretty cool uh hey no problem Cadillac bob heck yeah rapid fire um JD says
[6945.24 → 6950.12] can you say what happened with the marinas partnership uh we don't really comment if uh is
[6950.12 → 6958.28] a sponsor screws over our viewers then we will comment about it but if it's just you know hey it didn't
[6958.28 → 6963.56] work out but let's agree to be friends then we're not really gonna we're not about public drama
[6963.56 → 6967.40] dragging anyone through the mud maybe it was our fault maybe it was their fault I'm just gonna
[6967.40 → 6973.96] say that who knows whose fault it was cool uh Tillich says reminiscing about net linked i
[6973.96 → 6978.60] miss the host having their own spin when introducing the shorter news stories uh said more quickly than
[6978.60 → 6982.68] the others please have Riley say Central Park he never says Central Park anymore that's true
[6984.12 → 6992.60] um d temp says the red hat logo has been just a hat not shadow man for two and a half years yeah but
[6992.60 → 6999.64] that doesn't change that it was the logo for over 10. Uh tracker's odd regarding last man show if
[6999.64 → 7003.80] you're worried about running non-steam games I highly recommend Curtis yes, yes we're uh we're
[7003.80 → 7009.24] we're both we're both we're both at that point already I think uh Scott says I was looking for
[7010.04 → 7015.88] a video about t-lines instead of a reservoir thankful for the old one and six tech tips' number two
[7015.88 → 7020.68] are t-lines still viable today yeah they're just a pain in the butt getting all the air bled out of the
[7020.68 → 7024.76] system with a t-line sucks if you're looking to save a buck though it is a good way to do it one
[7024.76 → 7029.56] of the reasons we use t-lines so often back in the day was that the options for reservoirs were
[7029.56 → 7037.00] way more limited than they are now yes someone into the chat called me out for hands under the table
[7037.00 → 7044.68] again oh okay Andres Rivero says framework doesn't have third-party resellers uh shouldn't devices like
[7044.68 → 7050.28] their laptop or steam deck be sold through multiple channels uh it helps solve the warehouse issue you
[7050.28 → 7054.52] spoke about and let smaller shops grassroots evangelize the product at local level so
[7055.24 → 7061.48] what it doesn't help is it doesn't help you be profitable uh by the time you run a product
[7061.48 → 7065.96] through distribution and through a retailer you can assume that you're going to be giving up anywhere
[7065.96 → 7071.80] from 10 to 20 percent of your margin on the product that the consumer pays for that directly a lot
[7071.80 → 7077.16] of the need to do that these days is also gone like we've looked at we've looked at having third-party
[7077.16 → 7084.84] resellers for lttstore.com products but the reality of it is we don't mark we don't mark things up like
[7084.84 → 7091.00] we tend to go for really high quality materials in the stuff that we make and a lot of the time
[7091.00 → 7095.48] we'll end up spending an extra you know three dollars which doesn't sound like a lot of money, but that's
[7096.20 → 7101.08] that's the margin that we could have given a retailer in order to get broader exposure for our
[7101.08 → 7107.56] product so for something like an Amazon a marketplace I think it ends up costing only marginally more if
[7107.56 → 7112.76] we maintain if we own our own inventory, and it's just fulfilled by Amazon but if you're working
[7112.76 → 7116.68] through like a brick and mortar retailer they're going to expect to make considerable margin on the
[7116.68 → 7121.24] product that we honestly just don't have and I suspect that is quite similar for the steam deck and
[7121.24 → 7126.20] for the framework laptop yeah although neither of those companies have given me any access to their costs
[7126.20 → 7132.20] but like I said already though like it's I don't think it's really needed in the modern world
[7132.20 → 7139.48] online shopping is very easy and online shopping on individual stores like framework is also very easy
[7140.36 → 7145.40] another thing to consider is that you might think that a store buying your product means that you
[7145.40 → 7150.28] improve your cash flow, and it can, but a lot of times especially brick and mortar is going to expect
[7150.28 → 7158.36] anywhere from 30 to 90 days I think Costco demands six months uh payment terms so they have the
[7158.36 → 7163.80] inventory, but you're actually still the one who owns it and the larger the retailer you're working with
[7163.80 → 7170.28] the more that they can put the screws to you if for whatever reason the product is not moving very well
[7170.28 → 7176.36] and they want you to make it go away so it can actually end up being very expensive to load a bunch of
[7176.36 → 7181.24] your inventory into a retailer if they demand and remember they hold all the leverage because they
[7181.24 → 7186.60] have both their money and your product yeah and the exposure that you need to reach your customers
[7186.60 → 7191.48] they hold all the cards in that respect right so they could say hey look you need to give us a
[7191.48 → 7197.96] hundred dollar rebate for our spring savings sale event because your competitors are doing that
[7197.96 → 7202.36] and they'll work you against your competition like that in a way that you're kind of looking at it
[7202.36 → 7207.40] going well hey this like wasn't part of the deal we know we're trying to make this device that's
[7207.40 → 7212.20] really different we're low volume, and we can't really play this game i i would advise
[7212.20 → 7217.80] framework against taking that approach for the time being but not for obvious reasons like to be clear
[7217.80 → 7222.84] it's a very good question um just yeah I probably wouldn't do it they also have a tailored shopping
[7222.84 → 7228.68] experience um I don't know which one they sell more of but the DIY edition you like to pick things right
[7228.68 → 7234.44] yep it's not usually very easy to do through other types of stores captain pepper have you thought
[7234.44 → 7239.32] about looking at new e-bikes or e-scooters it's been five years since your last e-bike video
[7239.32 → 7243.56] uh, and they've been going through a huge boom you're right the reason we haven't really jumped
[7243.56 → 7249.56] back into it is that I feel like there are creators for the creators who service that niche
[7249.56 → 7254.60] really well and our big thing is that we don't want to jump into a conversation unless we have
[7254.60 → 7259.96] something to contribute to it and i just I feel like um as someone who daily drives one you know
[7259.96 → 7267.16] Herren is probably still qualified to talk about it but for my part I haven't really actively used
[7267.16 → 7273.48] any e-mobility products in a long time I was super into them and I wanted to try out every kitschy one
[7273.48 → 7278.44] that came out like back when I did that unicycle review like the electric unicycle and stuff like that
[7278.44 → 7282.76] but the reality of it is in my neighbourhood and the places I go and the things I do it's just
[7282.76 → 7288.44] not really practical I'm just going to get in the car I'm going to jump on my motorcycle yeah um
[7288.44 → 7293.48] canal says can you upload the past gaming live streams to float plane like your supreme commander
[7293.48 → 7298.92] and don't starve games uh there's only one that I think is missing and I forget why I didn't put it
[7298.92 → 7306.12] up I think I didn't end up with the God for some reason oh um yeah Mr Wilson I remember my first Linux
[7306.12 → 7311.24] experience I had experience installing windows and was stunned that on the first boot the desktop was the
[7311.24 → 7317.00] correct resolution without drivers it was emulating the GPU as a stop cap awesome idea yeah there's
[7317.00 → 7320.60] there are things that Linux does really well in fairness windows also boots up the correct
[7320.60 → 7325.40] resolution these days now yeah it's been a while was it Linux has been doing that better for a
[7325.40 → 7332.20] for a lot longer very long time yeah uh Aaron says if you're okay we're getting into a pretty heavy
[7332.20 → 7340.04] uh heavy part of the super charity here um if your engineering approach is the users should just
[7340.04 → 7344.28] read the manual and learn to use it then you are not a very good engineer you might actually be an
[7344.28 → 7349.72] excellent engineer but what you aren't is a good UX designer, and it depends on what you're making
[7349.72 → 7355.48] right if you're making something that is specifically just for experts in the field yes that's probably
[7355.48 → 7361.64] fine yeah um, and it might actually be better that way in a few different ways uh because you might
[7361.64 → 7368.76] have to oversimplify things to in order to accommodate that specifically better for new users' user experience
[7368.76 → 7376.04] etc but yeah anyway uh Rosalind Seville has probably the best super chat of the day yeah Linux is fine
[7376.04 → 7383.56] but it's no temple OS that's true Linux is almost nothing like temple OS what you said was factually
[7383.56 → 7391.24] accurate uh this is another great comment under here so I have I've googled this but I haven't looked
[7391.24 → 7398.92] at the results yet um this is fantastic to imagine someone makes a Linux distro that was Windows 7 like
[7398.92 → 7404.60] okay I've googled this but I haven't looked at the result yet here we go best Linux distributions that
[7404.60 → 7410.04] look like windows Linux lite Windows 7 users may not have the latest and greatest hardware so it's
[7410.04 → 7416.36] essential to use that is lightweight and easy to use okay can I replace uh okay so hold on that which
[7416.36 → 7423.08] look like Windows 11 and 10 for Windows 7 users looks a bit like windows okay oh you know what i
[7423.08 → 7430.20] was expecting one that is oh hold on distros that look like the Windows 7 Ctrl f 7 here we go
[7430.20 → 7437.24] man the number of like Linux distro listicles okay mint you can configure it to be the same as Windows XP
[7437.24 → 7441.88] Windows 7 Windows 8 or Windows 10. All right Linux communities got you covered, but that's also one of
[7441.88 → 7446.04] the biggest problems that make it extremely overwhelming to figure out which one to use
[7446.36 → 7458.12] uh oh man uh oh wow there's a lot I'm sorry guys I'm not reading all the super chat stuff um
[7459.00 → 7464.68] especially because some of it is just astonishingly stupid and I'm not out to antagonize our viewers
[7465.64 → 7471.80] i just I can't make my I can't make my head hurt enough that the amount that it would hurt just reading out
[7471.80 → 7488.92] what some of these things say um yeah okay cool uh okay what is this oh uh oh what's nick calling me for
[7489.72 → 7492.68] what's nick calling me for he must know he's going to be on wan show
[7492.68 → 7499.96] hey Nick you're live on wan show am I antagonizing the users too much they're not buying enough lttstore.com
[7500.68 → 7505.72] no, no I was just going to say uh the UFD stream is like one percent away from finishing so it'd be
[7505.72 → 7509.64] cool to send a bunch of people over there when you guys are done oh yeah what platform is it on
[7510.52 → 7514.68] um I think they're on YouTube and twitch but I think they're mainly on twitch all right
[7514.68 → 7521.16] cool thanks nick yeah you can raid them yeah ufd stream sponsored by Linus tech tips yeah
[7521.16 → 7527.48] yeah I'm not even joking it's sponsored genuinely is yeah it is um hey Taylor says my new GPU from
[7527.48 → 7532.60] verified actual gamer program shipped thanks so much LTT team my 1070 died last week we're pretty
[7532.60 → 7538.52] disappointed with how high the MSRPs are of cards now and verified actual gamer program is pretty much
[7538.52 → 7545.64] uh dead at this point uh because it feels like MSRPs and scalper prices have just kind of yeah
[7545.64 → 7550.92] MSRPs are rising like crazy equalized we did a fascinating video uh we shot it today
[7550.92 → 7556.04] where you know how one of the hacks to get a GPU for a while was to buy a system and then just flip
[7556.04 → 7562.76] all the other components so we did a cost analysis we went and bought a system at Best Buy and looked
[7562.76 → 7567.96] at everything that was in it and compared it to building your own and buying a scalped GPU
[7567.96 → 7573.40] and it was on par yeah yeah yeah they've they've closed all those holes um
[7575.24 → 7580.44] what was I going to say I don't remember Robert mail says first time I've been able to catch a live show
[7580.44 → 7588.76] or Maude nice new set hopefully I haven't missed much you are so full of crap first time I've been
[7588.76 → 7595.56] able to catch a let Robert say I recognize that name yeah you super chat every show let alone watching
[7595.56 → 7601.80] them uh SDG games is there an audio equivalent to the RGB colour space
[7601.80 → 7610.28] what as a creator what matters most to you in headphones or speakers well it's going to be
[7610.28 → 7615.64] it's going to be accuracy and then I think what you're kind of asking is like what like the
[7615.64 → 7620.52] range of performance they might have is in that case you're looking at like a frequency response
[7620.52 → 7625.96] curve so you want something that is able to reproduce very low and very high frequencies but
[7625.96 → 7633.08] it's not like RGB is kind of like it's the subset of all perceivable colours but in the audio
[7633.08 → 7638.04] spectrum we've had devices that have been able to reproduce the entire audible spectrum for many
[7638.04 → 7644.84] many years now so it just comes down to how well they can do it David campaign is a 2021 Facebook
[7644.84 → 7649.32] outage survivor yeah I think I survived all right too I didn't notice to be perfectly the only reason
[7649.32 → 7653.00] why I knew was because I went to the washroom which is the only time that I ever used Twitter
[7653.00 → 7657.16] twitter and I opened up twitter and everyone was talking about it and then I made a like meme about
[7657.16 → 7662.60] how flow plane is still up and then I didn't know that Facebook was down while it was down I found
[7662.60 → 7667.40] out later yeah because I was like working I don't know if I actually found out during or after because
[7667.40 → 7673.24] I never checked because I don't care hey thanks Rey oh just accepted an offer to join a fang company
[7673.24 → 7679.40] and started watching you when I was 13. Dang good for you taking that money get the money
[7679.40 → 7685.24] uh dusk pierce asks I sent this once but when you get the steam deck can you try it with an m cable
[7685.24 → 7688.60] you're going to have to remind me when it arrives I don't have an I'm not logged into like my accounts
[7688.60 → 7691.88] or anything I don't have a convenient way to write this down right now but um yes
[7692.84 → 7702.36] um I'm very interested to see that as well oh nice fan24 Dr says I got two Ltd store water bottles
[7702.36 → 7710.60] from UFD tech as he passed through Columbus on his cannonball run very nice sweet very nice uh Nokia
[7710.60 → 7716.92] 1119 says hey timestamp guy here the last on-site wan show was on the 14th of December 2019
[7716.92 → 7724.36] 664 days ago do you miss the old set I'll miss Luke's birds so that computer that we're running off
[7724.36 → 7732.04] of right now hadn't been turned on since january 2020 so when Jake turned it on there was like
[7732.04 → 7742.76] three hours of updates we know how long it's been uh, uh Conrad in float plane chat said I work for fang
[7742.76 → 7749.56] as well float plane Amazon apple Netflix google lol that's a good one I mean with how much downtime
[7749.56 → 7754.20] Facebook has had I don't think they deserve to be a fang anymore oh get wrecked I think it's more based
[7754.20 → 7759.32] around the money but blackjack 410 says I just subscribed to float plane I don't see this stream
[7759.32 → 7763.48] uh it's on there it's in the live tab um and I wanted to yell at you all and ask how long I have
[7763.48 → 7764.92] to wait to buy a freaking screwdriver
[7771.56 → 7779.48] wounds a little fresh um a little fresh I got a call from nick before the show the screwdriver is very
[7779.48 → 7790.36] delayed it's like it's its delayed it's like new year delayed at this point um has to do with the
[7790.36 → 7795.80] power outages in China pushing work back to Taiwan where we're manufacturing a number of the parts um
[7795.80 → 7799.56] and other places being pushed back to other places being pushed back to Taiwan as well
[7799.56 → 7807.80] um we explored the option of having some of it done in Canada but um while the steel stuff could be done
[7807.80 → 7814.76] here the manufacturer we're working with uh for the zinc housings is not confident that the zinc work
[7814.76 → 7822.28] could be done here um, and it was so it would add I think about 10 11 of cost we would have to
[7823.56 → 7828.12] produce the things in Taiwan then we'd have to send all the materials so we'd have to send all the materials
[7828.12 → 7832.12] to Canada then send them back to Taiwan to be assembled then send them back here so it was
[7832.12 → 7838.36] going to add other delays like logistical delays even if they could work on it which is a
[7838.36 → 7842.84] big issue right now just throwing that and I think it was going to add a cost of about 11 a unit we're
[7842.84 → 7846.84] already doing some of the production in Canada we're doing final assembly we're doing all the injection
[7846.84 → 7852.52] moulding uh here like it's not like this is just over keeping out, and we're just trying to do everything
[7852.52 → 7857.80] at the lowest possible cost it's just the the the Taiwanese manufacturer that we're working with
[7857.80 → 7864.20] is not um is not able to get a lot of the materials that they need to produce it and that has to do with
[7864.20 → 7873.64] shortages and challenges going on really across well across the world really oh boy yeah so it's going to
[7873.64 → 7885.00] be it's going to be a minute yeah that one was a little fresh uh XP bill says Linus why is your name
[7885.00 → 7889.24] pronounced a little differently than Linux even though it is only one letter different please very
[7889.24 → 7896.60] important question uh because Linus Torvalds is Finnish I think yeah finish I think so-and-so his name
[7896.60 → 7903.00] even though it's spelled exactly the same as mine is I think usually pronounced Linus so Linus Linux
[7903.64 → 7909.16] Linus because I'm not Finnish and I don't speak anything other than time to make a new distro
[7909.72 → 7912.28] uh like if I was lynx that's not going to get confused
[7915.00 → 7921.48] yeah I'll do uh I'll like fork arch or something Linux arch linux
[7921.48 → 7929.64] yes that's very helpful, thank you Luke all right I think that is pretty much if there's
[7929.64 → 7935.08] there's Hannah Montana Linux yeah, thank you for that I think that's pretty much it for the uh the
[7935.08 → 7940.36] wan show today we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel we may be in person next
[7940.36 → 7946.12] week depending on how much progress Luke and I have made on our streaming aspect of the Linux challenge
[7946.12 → 7953.40] uh we'll probably be back to in person after that but I think a wan show is a good acid test for just
[7953.40 → 7958.68] how well we have each managed to get our streaming setups working we might do we might do it a different
[7958.68 → 7964.04] way maybe we both do like a simultaneous stream on twitch one night or something like that and maybe we
[7964.04 → 7967.48] just do a wan show here I don't know we'll figure it out thanks for tuning in we'll see you guys again
[7968.68 → 7969.00] bye
[7969.00 → 7982.04] oh oh oh we got a raid UFD hey how do you how does one rate you slash raid space and then their channel
[7982.04 → 7988.84] name so slash raid space uh of d, but it's disciple so of disciple
[7988.84 → 7999.80] okay so did i do that I think okay there it goes all right all right see you later guys
[7999.80 → 8009.80] yeah you're doing it yeah
[8018.84 → 8028.20] okay we are still live on fish and float plane but I have cut the YouTube
