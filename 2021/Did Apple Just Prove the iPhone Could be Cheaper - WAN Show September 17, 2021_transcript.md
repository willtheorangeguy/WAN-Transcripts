[0.00 --> 1.04]  Wait, the thing isn't working?
[1.36 --> 2.14]  What's up guys?
[2.28 --> 3.62]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[3.72 --> 6.12]  We've got a fantastic show lined up for you today.
[6.20 --> 8.60]  Gonna be a lot of fun, a lot of great topics,
[8.72 --> 10.52]  a lot of new Apple devices.
[11.72 --> 14.52]  Of course, one of the biggest ones in this announcement
[14.52 --> 16.78]  was the new iPad mini.
[16.94 --> 18.36]  So we'll be chatting about that.
[18.42 --> 20.24]  I actually missed the announcement stream.
[20.60 --> 22.56]  I was making a video about something else.
[22.68 --> 25.56]  So we're gonna go through it together with you guys.
[25.96 --> 27.46]  What else we got to talk about?
[27.46 --> 31.12]  Oh, good thing I didn't buy a Samsung The Wall.
[31.62 --> 34.78]  I mean, you know, budget aside,
[35.08 --> 37.86]  still having that money to invest in, you know,
[38.10 --> 40.24]  framework or something that that's good too.
[40.60 --> 45.12]  But also LG now has a competitor to The Wall
[45.12 --> 47.62]  that looks pretty freaking cool.
[49.06 --> 50.92]  And it's actually marketed for home cinema
[50.92 --> 52.38]  instead of like a signage.
[52.38 --> 56.66]  No, Samsung has their luxury The Wall consumer edition as well.
[56.66 --> 57.72]  What else we got, Luke?
[58.04 --> 58.78]  Okay, okay.
[59.50 --> 60.52]  Tons of stuff.
[60.64 --> 61.70]  Trust me, don't worry.
[61.82 --> 66.24]  Everything's totally, there's lots of things in the dock.
[67.12 --> 68.02]  Did you get signed out?
[69.28 --> 70.08]  No, I didn't.
[70.22 --> 71.58]  There's just really not a lot here.
[72.30 --> 75.48]  SpaceX's Inspiration4 put civilians in space.
[75.62 --> 76.10]  Hooray!
[76.42 --> 77.38]  Yeah, they did it.
[77.38 --> 82.68]  Google's Pixel 6 Tensor Chip CPU layout details leak.
[83.04 --> 84.98]  Hopefully it results in a phone
[84.98 --> 88.14]  that isn't completely buggy and horrible on a launch.
[88.24 --> 90.36]  That would be a nice change for modern Pixels.
[90.70 --> 91.84]  Yeah, we'll see how that goes.
[91.92 --> 93.10]  All right, let's roll that intro.
[93.10 --> 93.26]  All right.
[93.26 --> 93.30]  All right.
[93.30 --> 93.32]  Let's roll that intro.
[99.32 --> 104.84]  Did you even mention your headphones?
[104.84 --> 105.84]  No.
[107.64 --> 109.86]  Chat is very focused on your headphones.
[110.64 --> 112.56]  Oh, which chat is focused on my headphones?
[112.70 --> 113.00]  Float playing?
[113.12 --> 114.82]  I don't see it too much for float playing right now.
[115.48 --> 116.16]  Oh, crap.
[116.32 --> 117.14]  We have a problem.
[119.00 --> 121.16]  I think Jeff is off today.
[121.96 --> 126.66]  And our sales team manager, one Colton Potter,
[126.96 --> 128.80]  apparently didn't have anyone cover.
[128.80 --> 133.36]  So I guess Colton's going to be joining us on the WAN show real quick
[133.36 --> 136.26]  to explain why we don't have sponsors for the show today.
[136.38 --> 137.18]  Oh, nice.
[137.28 --> 137.56]  Okay.
[138.08 --> 141.28]  Hey, Colton, you're live on the WAN show, sir.
[141.38 --> 142.58]  Hey, what's up?
[142.78 --> 143.40]  Hey, yeah.
[144.00 --> 146.94]  What's not up is my revenue right now.
[147.56 --> 149.94]  My revenue on the WAN show is a little low.
[150.14 --> 151.82]  I don't think I got sponsors.
[151.98 --> 152.82]  Is Jeff off today?
[153.44 --> 154.48]  You don't have any sponsors?
[154.66 --> 155.54]  No, Jeff's on today.
[155.62 --> 156.54]  He should be there.
[156.60 --> 157.48]  You don't have any sponsors?
[157.48 --> 157.84]  Really?
[157.94 --> 159.54]  You're going to throw Jeff under the bus, Colton.
[160.12 --> 161.50]  That's how it's going to be with you.
[161.90 --> 165.00]  See, I knew I promoted you for a reason.
[165.16 --> 166.26]  I promoted you for a reason.
[166.40 --> 168.26]  You're throw other people under the bus skills?
[168.90 --> 169.18]  Man.
[171.12 --> 172.12]  I'm on vacation.
[172.40 --> 173.12]  I'm sorry.
[173.22 --> 174.28]  I just got off a plane.
[176.22 --> 176.58]  Okay.
[176.84 --> 179.18]  I guess I'll have to message Jeff then,
[179.24 --> 181.86]  and hopefully I get a sponsor at some point.
[181.86 --> 181.90]  All right.
[181.98 --> 183.38]  We'll get some sponsors here.
[183.46 --> 184.24]  We'll work on it.
[184.24 --> 186.40]  I'll try to figure out what's going on too, all right?
[186.40 --> 187.04]  No, it's okay.
[187.04 --> 187.54]  Thanks a lot.
[187.62 --> 188.38]  I'll message Jeff.
[188.44 --> 189.86]  Hey, where'd you fly to?
[189.90 --> 190.86]  Where'd you fly to, bruh?
[191.14 --> 193.18]  A lovely place called Prince Rupert.
[193.24 --> 194.60]  Tell the WAN show to check it out.
[195.12 --> 196.52]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[198.20 --> 198.56]  Wow.
[199.32 --> 199.68]  Okay.
[199.98 --> 201.52]  So, oh, wow.
[201.72 --> 202.06]  Okay.
[202.24 --> 202.58]  Yeah.
[202.80 --> 204.50]  I was going to say, I don't know what to say.
[204.56 --> 206.24]  I was going to say, have a good weekend, but like.
[207.94 --> 208.84]  It's really wet.
[208.90 --> 210.90]  It's raining here, as it always does.
[210.90 --> 214.26]  Anyway, I'll talk to Jeff too.
[214.26 --> 214.82]  All right.
[214.90 --> 215.36]  See you later.
[215.40 --> 215.58]  All right.
[215.98 --> 216.34]  Bye-bye.
[216.78 --> 217.82]  Oh, Prince Rupert.
[217.90 --> 218.14]  Yeah.
[219.36 --> 222.88]  Floatplane chat be like, best get back on that plane.
[225.48 --> 226.98]  I mean, yeah.
[227.14 --> 229.16]  You know, beautiful British Columbia.
[230.16 --> 233.06]  Man, it's pretty wet and it's pretty cold.
[233.60 --> 234.56]  Prince Rupert, man.
[234.70 --> 235.54]  Okay, cool.
[235.54 --> 237.28]  Important city.
[237.50 --> 239.28]  You know, love all you Prince Rupertians.
[240.02 --> 240.54]  Rupertians?
[240.92 --> 241.98]  Prince Rupertians?
[242.48 --> 243.16]  I like that.
[243.40 --> 247.26]  The point is, we're going to have some sponsors for you real quick, fast.
[247.40 --> 250.22]  Let's first jump into our first topic.
[250.36 --> 253.92]  Apple's annual September harvest.
[254.90 --> 259.58]  Source one for this topic was every tech outlet on earth.
[259.58 --> 266.76]  And this is going to be a really interesting WAN show run through because our notes on this
[266.76 --> 270.52]  topic were prepared by the one and only, my God, Hob.
[271.08 --> 273.54]  It is like hurricaning outside.
[274.06 --> 278.82]  Guys, if the show goes away, you will know that my power went out.
[279.18 --> 283.36]  So, yeah, we're going to see how that goes.
[284.20 --> 286.92]  It's battering the sliding glass doors to my right.
[286.98 --> 289.10]  I'm actually like stoked it's not coming through the mic.
[289.10 --> 291.76]  I'm just stoked I'm not in Prince Rupert right now.
[292.72 --> 293.18]  All right.
[293.32 --> 299.22]  So, our notes for the Apple annual September event were prepared by the one and only Jonathan
[299.22 --> 305.88]  Horst, our writer and host for Mac address, which is our Apple-centric channel.
[306.46 --> 312.92]  So, Luke and I are going to be giving you our take on notes provided by our resident Apple
[312.92 --> 313.34]  shill.
[313.34 --> 318.12]  So, to be clear, to be clear, Horst is a journalist at heart.
[318.12 --> 320.64]  He's not a shill by any stretch of the imagination.
[321.12 --> 324.90]  But he's definitely, let's put it this way, more immersed in the ecosystem.
[325.78 --> 330.26]  Tuesday's Apple event titled California Streaming for no obvious reason.
[330.92 --> 332.82]  Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?
[332.82 --> 340.72]  Just like, okay, we're just going to take a song title and like make it a pun and it will
[340.72 --> 342.90]  have nothing to do with streaming at all.
[343.04 --> 349.92]  Like, I saw that and I expected a whole bunch of, like, I expected it to be really Apple TV
[349.92 --> 350.78]  focused or something.
[350.84 --> 355.78]  And they did talk about some new shows and new workouts and you can work out with others
[355.78 --> 357.42]  and SharePlay and all of that.
[357.50 --> 359.74]  But this was a hardware focused event.
[359.80 --> 362.10]  This was hardware first and hard.
[363.20 --> 369.78]  With the biggest one being the new A15 chip, which is the heart of all the fancy new iDevices.
[369.78 --> 374.94]  It features a six core design, two high performance cores, four efficiency cores, rated it up to
[374.94 --> 377.50]  3.23 gigahertz on the iPhone 13 Pro.
[377.50 --> 385.48]  And in the event, Apple compared the CPU to the competition, which is a little unusual
[385.48 --> 386.24]  for them.
[386.32 --> 394.14]  They said it is 50% faster than the competition instead of doing what they normally do, which
[394.14 --> 396.70]  is compare against the last gen iPhone.
[396.88 --> 401.42]  Because Apple, for the most part, lives in a bubble where nothing else exists.
[401.52 --> 404.74]  You either have an iPhone or you are some kind of caveman.
[404.74 --> 407.08]  Geekbench results have trickled out.
[407.38 --> 413.94]  On the iPhone 13 Pro, the A15 gets around 1728 single core, 4695 multi-core.
[414.44 --> 421.34]  And what it appears is that Apple's CPU improvements have slowed down.
[422.08 --> 428.10]  And I mean, we, I'm sure, man, I can't think of exactly when I said this.
[428.22 --> 430.58]  I'm sure I said it at some point.
[430.58 --> 438.64]  But the mobile space has kind of been like, exactly like the PC space, but kind of like
[438.64 --> 444.56]  in the way that a flea is sort of like a, you know, like a larger mammal.
[444.56 --> 450.04]  Like they have a very similar life cycle, but, but the flea just does everything so much
[450.04 --> 450.52]  faster.
[450.52 --> 456.94]  So mobile went from, from sort of, you know, just starting out and everything was super
[456.94 --> 461.38]  crappy to, wow, we're getting these monstrous improvements, monstrous, monstrous, monstrous
[461.38 --> 466.16]  improvements to, okay, now we're hitting a wall and it's actually really hard to squeeze
[466.16 --> 467.50]  more performance out of these things.
[467.50 --> 470.80]  And it happened on this, this accelerated scale.
[470.80 --> 476.28]  And the reality of it is that Apple is still designing outstanding CPUs and SoCs.
[476.28 --> 478.70]  So the CPU would be a part of the SoC.
[478.70 --> 482.70]  It's just that physics, physics is a bitch.
[483.94 --> 485.04]  What are you going to do about it?
[485.62 --> 489.10]  You can't keep just making it less nanometers.
[489.40 --> 490.32]  It's not that simple.
[490.86 --> 491.32]  Sorry, Luke.
[491.32 --> 496.32]  There's also like the vast majority of applications that consumers use it for are satisfied.
[496.64 --> 498.84]  That's another thing that happened with PCs as well.
[498.84 --> 504.98]  Um, like as much as gamers want faster computers, as much as scientists and industry want faster
[504.98 --> 509.64]  computers, the average consumer doesn't really need it too much.
[510.04 --> 513.78]  Um, and the, the average consumer can do most of the things that they really need to do on
[513.78 --> 517.22]  their phone other than potentially play faster games again.
[517.38 --> 522.94]  So there's a market for it, but like it's hit, it's hit the satisfactory level for standard
[522.94 --> 524.26]  applications for consumers.
[524.26 --> 527.22]  Our biggest problem with mobile gaming though, isn't even the performance.
[527.22 --> 529.80]  It's actually managing to freaking maintain it.
[529.86 --> 536.34]  I mean, on a modern device and to be clear, Apple does a better job of this than most of
[536.34 --> 538.60]  their Android competitors on a modern device.
[538.74 --> 544.30]  You actually could easily run it at native resolution or at least what it needs to be.
[544.38 --> 549.98]  I mean, 1080p on a screen like this freaking size is lots.
[550.24 --> 550.92]  It's lots.
[550.92 --> 553.74]  So you'd be able to run it at native res, high refresh rate.
[553.86 --> 555.96]  All you have to do is keep the bloody thing from throttling.
[556.86 --> 563.04]  Um, the integrated GPU has four to five cores and we get six gigs of RAM on the iPhone 13
[563.04 --> 565.80]  pro series and the rest get four gigs.
[566.04 --> 571.04]  I believe they finally did away with the 64 gig iPhone this time around.
[571.16 --> 577.80]  We talked about that on tech linked and in other big news for the iPhone specifically,
[577.80 --> 585.36]  ProRes is now supported on the iPhone 13 pro.
[585.58 --> 589.04]  That is pretty freaking sick.
[589.14 --> 596.22]  Like if you are into recording mobile video, there is absolutely no other choice at this
[596.22 --> 596.56]  point.
[596.56 --> 601.94]  If you record video on your phone, like now that Apple supports ProRes, giving you the flexibility
[601.94 --> 606.58]  to grade your footage and post and really retain more of that data.
[606.92 --> 608.92]  I mean, the proof is going to be in the pudding.
[609.08 --> 618.94]  We have not been hands on with it yet, but this is in my opinion, um, the biggest part of
[618.94 --> 619.66]  this announcement.
[619.82 --> 623.10]  I mean, they didn't really do anything else that blows me away.
[623.10 --> 626.84]  They, they, they upgraded the camera module here and there.
[627.04 --> 635.00]  They, they added a one terabyte model, which gets you up to $1,600 on a pro max brighter
[635.00 --> 638.42]  screen, 1200 nits peak brightness on the iPhone 13 pro.
[638.56 --> 644.80]  But being able to record ProRes as a creative man, their video was already amazing.
[644.98 --> 648.10]  This just takes it one more step above.
[648.10 --> 649.66]  It should be noted though.
[649.90 --> 651.10]  This is interesting.
[651.72 --> 659.82]  The 12, 128 gig version cannot record in ProRes at 4k 30 FPS.
[660.26 --> 662.36]  It is capped at 1080p.
[662.94 --> 666.34]  So Luke, you're Apple, right?
[667.04 --> 668.24]  You're sitting in the boardroom.
[668.56 --> 669.46]  Walk me through this.
[670.02 --> 676.20]  Your options are, okay, you've got this great feature, but your phone just doesn't have enough
[676.20 --> 678.50]  storage to actually utilize it.
[678.62 --> 678.90]  Okay.
[679.66 --> 681.14]  You've got options though.
[681.54 --> 688.52]  You can either cripple the feature for your entry level users who, by the way, not that
[688.52 --> 689.12]  entry level.
[689.46 --> 693.04]  Um, they, they are still buying your pro phone.
[693.14 --> 695.86]  They're still buying your top, top series of phone.
[695.94 --> 696.34]  $800.
[696.82 --> 697.00]  Okay.
[697.00 --> 701.98]  So you can, you can kneecap this, this, this feature or, or hear me out.
[702.18 --> 702.72]  Hear me out.
[702.80 --> 703.10]  Okay.
[703.10 --> 705.94]  You could put expandable storage on your bloody phone.
[707.00 --> 710.54]  Nah, because I mean, Tim Sweeney probably would like that.
[710.80 --> 712.60]  So let's, let's Sweeney.
[713.18 --> 714.30]  Tim Sweeney.
[714.48 --> 717.10]  This has nothing to do with the Apple versus Epic lawsuit.
[717.74 --> 719.52]  He'd probably think that's cool.
[719.64 --> 721.60]  So we got to make sure we stay away from that.
[722.08 --> 726.18]  Um, let's, let's, let's hamstring that, that low version.
[726.36 --> 727.78]  Let's make people buy the expensive one.
[727.82 --> 728.50]  This, this is good.
[728.56 --> 729.20]  This makes sense.
[729.32 --> 729.60]  Okay.
[729.60 --> 734.98]  Like, thank you because this will create a differentiation for people because they'll
[734.98 --> 738.02]  be able to go like, Oh yeah, you have an iPhone.
[738.56 --> 740.36]  Can you record in pro res?
[740.52 --> 741.08]  No.
[742.22 --> 742.66]  Ooh.
[743.96 --> 745.02]  All right.
[745.16 --> 746.08]  All right.
[746.30 --> 751.22]  They should make it so that when you message someone on iMessage, if you have pro res capability
[751.22 --> 753.56]  on your phone, you get a different colored chat bubble.
[754.44 --> 755.28]  Oh my God.
[755.36 --> 755.98]  You know what?
[756.90 --> 757.30]  Whoa.
[758.20 --> 759.42]  I'm amazed.
[759.60 --> 761.54]  Apple hasn't done that yet.
[761.88 --> 763.76]  If you have the newest phone, you get a cool.
[764.02 --> 764.20]  Yeah.
[764.48 --> 765.94]  A new color of chat.
[766.02 --> 771.08]  Well, I mean, it's not like they haven't added features to chat that are enabled only
[771.08 --> 773.56]  on upper tier phones or brand new phones.
[773.56 --> 774.96]  Like Animojis, for example.
[775.44 --> 776.44]  Does anyone, does anyone use those?
[776.50 --> 778.06]  Are those like kind of dead meme at this point?
[778.10 --> 779.00]  Or are they super cool?
[779.34 --> 780.88]  Guys, you're going to have to let me know in the chat.
[780.88 --> 783.88]  I don't, I don't text any children.
[784.28 --> 788.24]  So I don't, I don't know what the new meta is for, for iMessage.
[788.32 --> 789.40]  I just, I have no idea.
[789.80 --> 790.78]  I would love to know.
[790.82 --> 791.74]  I genuinely want to know.
[791.80 --> 793.00]  Are Animojis cool?
[793.10 --> 793.76]  Were they ever cool?
[793.86 --> 794.96]  I have no idea.
[795.46 --> 799.12]  So it's not like they haven't pulled that before, but oh man, that would be next level.
[799.30 --> 800.72]  I could see them doing it.
[800.76 --> 807.82]  Actually, I really could see them doing it, but only for like a really, really special device.
[807.82 --> 813.88]  Like if they did a, an anniversary edition iPhone or something like that, you know, they want
[813.88 --> 819.34]  to go like years down the line, even, you know, 50th anniversary iPhone.
[819.46 --> 820.36]  You know, I don't know.
[820.40 --> 820.62]  Right.
[820.78 --> 822.44]  But something really special.
[822.44 --> 830.06]  If you had like, like a really trendy, like pearl white chat bubble, how cool would that
[830.06 --> 830.38]  be?
[830.90 --> 833.56]  How much cooler would you be than all of your friends?
[833.72 --> 833.92]  Right?
[834.46 --> 836.60]  Man, I could, I could totally see them doing it.
[837.28 --> 837.88]  All right.
[837.92 --> 840.30]  Let's talk about the iPhone 13 and the mini.
[840.50 --> 842.20]  They both get brighter screens as well.
[842.28 --> 846.20]  Peak brightness is 800 nits and they get a narrower notch.
[846.36 --> 850.82]  Camera specs largely the same, although allegedly the sensors collect more light and the wide
[850.82 --> 852.96]  camera gets sensor shift optical image stabilization.
[853.62 --> 855.42]  There are computational updates to the camera.
[855.50 --> 856.70]  This should be applicable to both.
[856.70 --> 861.64]  So there's a cinematic mode that provides algorithmic rack focusing to smooth, to smooth out focus
[861.64 --> 861.90]  pulls.
[862.06 --> 866.80]  So if you really are into shooting your, your indie doc or whatever, or your, your student
[866.80 --> 870.40]  film on your iPhone, this is going to give you more options for it.
[870.40 --> 873.62]  And they added a 500 and 12 gigabytes tier.
[874.06 --> 877.50]  Now for me, the iPhone was not the big announcement.
[877.50 --> 881.64]  And honestly, that's kind of the vibe that I'm getting from a lot of people.
[881.86 --> 884.24]  For me, the big one was the iPad mini.
[884.24 --> 887.30]  It's got a new squared off design like the iPad Air.
[887.40 --> 891.68]  The volume buttons are located at the top and it gets Apple pencil support.
[892.30 --> 895.24]  It gets a power button with a touch ID sensor.
[896.54 --> 897.10]  Nice.
[897.54 --> 898.44]  Freaking nice.
[898.54 --> 901.58]  I believe that's the first time we've seen this from Apple.
[901.74 --> 905.16]  It gets a slightly detuned A15 chip.
[905.28 --> 908.98]  And the screen is an 8.3 inch liquid retina display.
[909.18 --> 910.92]  It gets a USB-C port.
[910.92 --> 917.76]  Man, the number of people that I see on the Apple side of things that are pushing back
[917.76 --> 922.38]  against the desire for USB-C support, it bewilders me.
[923.02 --> 924.24]  It kind of bewilders me.
[924.74 --> 929.14]  Like Apple, Apple fans embraced the lightning change.
[929.14 --> 934.00]  If I recall correctly, I think there was a little bit of pushback, but I think for the
[934.00 --> 939.22]  most part, they recognize this is an objectively better connector and lightning really is a
[939.22 --> 942.52]  lot better than the old 40 pin Apple connector and micro USB.
[943.30 --> 946.90]  But what's this hesitation for USB-C?
[947.06 --> 950.16]  I hear a lot of, you know, I already have all these lightning accessories.
[950.44 --> 952.28]  Okay, that's fair enough.
[952.34 --> 955.90]  But at some point, it's going to have to change.
[956.04 --> 958.26]  And USB-C is the obvious successor.
[958.26 --> 963.66]  If anything, I'd be an Apple fan going, why do I have to carry around two stupid different
[963.66 --> 970.40]  kinds of cables now for my MacBook and for my iPad and for my freaking iPhone that's
[970.40 --> 971.84]  still using lightning for some reason?
[973.26 --> 974.78]  I, yeah, I don't know.
[974.88 --> 979.82]  I could maybe understand some amount of frustration because in, as far as the port and the jack
[979.82 --> 983.10]  goes, I have said this for a long time.
[983.58 --> 985.94]  USB-C feels like a downgrade from lightning.
[985.94 --> 987.58]  That's fair.
[988.02 --> 988.44]  That's fair.
[988.60 --> 989.00]  USB?
[989.22 --> 990.66]  Obviously, no, no, no.
[990.92 --> 996.00]  Beyond that, but just the usability of the port and the jack, lightning feels significantly
[996.00 --> 996.42]  better.
[996.84 --> 997.32]  That's fair.
[997.52 --> 1002.76]  I can understand buying all these like premium lightning compatible devices and then needing
[1002.76 --> 1009.78]  to buy new stuff for USB-C with the experience, maybe not the performance in certain ways, but
[1009.78 --> 1011.10]  the experience is worse.
[1011.10 --> 1017.00]  But the experience of USB-C is at least consistent.
[1017.54 --> 1025.86]  I carry one charger in my backpack and whether I've got my laptop, my switch, my phone, a tablet,
[1026.30 --> 1026.94]  doesn't matter.
[1027.08 --> 1029.56]  I can use that exact same charger.
[1029.70 --> 1032.24]  That is, that is a great experience.
[1032.24 --> 1033.52]  And I love it.
[1033.52 --> 1041.26]  I couldn't believe when Nintendo went standard USB-C because I was like, wow, I can carry
[1041.26 --> 1044.36]  one charger and one type of cable now.
[1044.44 --> 1045.24]  This is fantastic.
[1046.70 --> 1051.98]  I was super stoked and very surprised when they use some of the same power cables for two
[1051.98 --> 1053.46]  generations of consoles.
[1053.62 --> 1054.54]  I was like, oh, wow.
[1054.94 --> 1055.72]  Thanks, Nintendo.
[1056.08 --> 1057.72]  You didn't do what you used to do.
[1057.96 --> 1059.68]  Now they're using standardized connectors.
[1059.82 --> 1060.34]  It's fantastic.
[1060.34 --> 1064.48]  The big thing for me though about the iPad mini is honestly the price.
[1064.68 --> 1067.88]  The fact that this thing comes in at $699.
[1068.16 --> 1073.50]  This is what I was alluding to in the title of the video here, guys, because this is pretty
[1073.50 --> 1080.82]  much a gigantic iPhone, except it starts at $500.
[1081.98 --> 1085.20]  Like that's kind of freaking awesome.
[1085.20 --> 1088.78]  Liquid Retina display.
[1089.28 --> 1090.46]  Super, super bright.
[1091.00 --> 1092.26]  A15 Bionic chip.
[1093.58 --> 1098.04]  I actually, like I'm, for the first time in a long time, I'm tempted to grab an iPad.
[1098.32 --> 1105.46]  If I didn't have a folding phone, which gives me no reason to own an iPad mini, then this
[1105.46 --> 1107.84]  is the, this is the device that I would want to sit.
[1107.84 --> 1113.04]  And I just, I have such a hard time giving Amazon the, the money that they ask for like
[1113.04 --> 1113.84]  Kindle devices.
[1114.18 --> 1119.76]  Like what is the, what's the premium, the premium Kindle go for, which to be clear is
[1119.76 --> 1121.34]  still an e-ink display.
[1121.34 --> 1126.26]  And like the, I don't think it's that comparable.
[1126.64 --> 1130.18]  Very, very basic, basic CPU.
[1130.84 --> 1133.56]  Kindle Oasis currently unavailable.
[1133.56 --> 1134.00]  Okay.
[1135.44 --> 1137.52]  What does the, are you serious?
[1138.30 --> 1140.64]  Here's the ad supported version currently unavailable.
[1140.76 --> 1141.02]  Oh wow.
[1141.06 --> 1143.56]  These things, you couldn't get a Kindle even if you wanted to.
[1143.94 --> 1147.44]  Guys, hit me in the, hit me in the chat and let me know what the normal price.
[1147.70 --> 1148.94]  Oasis is 250 bucks.
[1149.42 --> 1155.04]  I would, I would without hesitation spend another 250 bucks on an iPad that I can also sit and
[1155.04 --> 1158.34]  play casual games on or watch movies on or whatever the case may be.
[1158.90 --> 1161.84]  John Wick says there's still really good Kobos that are way better than Kindles.
[1161.90 --> 1162.04]  Okay.
[1162.04 --> 1162.72]  That's fair enough.
[1162.72 --> 1166.06]  On an, on, especially on an OLED, that's a bit of a disappointment.
[1166.40 --> 1170.16]  OLED display, I would have been, I would have been happier about on the iPad, but especially
[1170.16 --> 1174.40]  on an OLED, I can't think of any reason to go e-ink anymore.
[1176.12 --> 1179.96]  Alex the Noob says e-ink is way better to read and has weeks of battery.
[1181.40 --> 1183.02]  That's fair enough.
[1183.70 --> 1183.96]  It's a different thing though.
[1184.04 --> 1188.52]  Like we're, we're comparing, like, especially with that comparison where they're talking
[1188.52 --> 1194.92]  about the quality of the screen, we're, we're comparing an, an iPad mini to a, a very specified
[1194.92 --> 1197.18]  device used for reading books.
[1197.18 --> 1198.08]  Like these are not.
[1198.20 --> 1198.56]  Yes.
[1198.90 --> 1205.02]  The, what I'm saying is I have this money and do I want to give Amazon, do I want to buy
[1205.02 --> 1208.36]  a $250 premium Kindle that can do nothing but read books?
[1208.70 --> 1211.30]  Or would I rather have this iPad for twice as much?
[1211.36 --> 1213.38]  In my opinion, the iPad is the no brainer.
[1213.88 --> 1216.76]  Your opinion, your opinion may differ.
[1217.14 --> 1222.64]  But I personally do not find that I get a significant amount of eye fatigue from a sufficiently
[1222.64 --> 1228.44]  dark screen and particularly like I, I will always configure it for white text on a black
[1228.44 --> 1228.86]  background.
[1228.86 --> 1233.58]  I find that that's a lot more comfortable for me, but again, your mileage may vary.
[1234.04 --> 1237.58]  Uh, in other news, the ninth gen iPad is also here.
[1237.76 --> 1239.98]  It's super uninteresting.
[1240.38 --> 1241.76]  And the Apple watch series seven.
[1241.76 --> 1243.82]  I would just buy both as most people would know.
[1244.34 --> 1244.74]  Wait, what?
[1244.86 --> 1245.08]  No.
[1245.76 --> 1246.08]  Sorry.
[1247.66 --> 1247.96]  Keep going.
[1248.02 --> 1250.12]  And the Apple watch series seven is also here.
[1250.20 --> 1251.36]  The screen's a bit bigger.
[1251.36 --> 1253.60]  Um, the front cover crystal has been strengthened.
[1253.78 --> 1256.88]  Oh, uh, go through the rest of this because I want to talk about that.
[1256.90 --> 1257.38]  I'll be right back.
[1257.92 --> 1260.32]  Which means the inclusion of a keyboard.
[1260.66 --> 1265.48]  Apparently there's a whole story about that, uh, which is, I'm assuming what Linus is going
[1265.48 --> 1266.18]  to address right now.
[1266.20 --> 1267.32]  So I'm going to go keep moving forward.
[1267.32 --> 1274.92]  Uh, charging is faster, 33% faster, uh, with a new USB-C charging cable, no new processors,
[1275.22 --> 1279.56]  sensors, or enclosure, uh, as was apparently rumored ahead of time.
[1279.56 --> 1282.90]  Uh, the price is also the same as the series six as $399.
[1283.82 --> 1286.16]  Um, and that is across the lineup.
[1286.28 --> 1289.00]  The series three starts at $199.
[1289.42 --> 1292.22]  It is delayed until sometime this fall.
[1292.80 --> 1294.40]  Um, so still coming.
[1294.86 --> 1300.18]  There's apparently a new swipe capable keyboard that's led to a lawsuit by an app developer
[1300.18 --> 1301.96]  whose app they just ripped off.
[1302.42 --> 1302.72]  Yikes.
[1302.72 --> 1305.98]  Yeah, this is pretty, this is pretty brutal.
[1307.28 --> 1312.66]  Apparently Apple blocked the app from the app store just before implementing this new
[1312.66 --> 1313.10]  feature.
[1313.62 --> 1315.24]  This is known as Sherlocking.
[1315.32 --> 1315.50]  Yeah.
[1315.64 --> 1321.32]  We, we had some concerns, uh, with a partner that we were looking into working with a float
[1321.32 --> 1324.96]  plane, uh, about Sherlocking very, very recently.
[1324.96 --> 1331.86]  But, um, this is known as Sherlocking, a reference to Apple's Sherlock three search tool in early
[1331.86 --> 1336.10]  Mac OS X, which integrated all the features of a competing app Watson.
[1336.76 --> 1341.56]  Uh, it's worth noting that in both cases, the functionality was claimed to be a natural
[1341.56 --> 1345.50]  development, uh, and this lawsuit in particular begs to differ.
[1346.16 --> 1346.84]  Yeah.
[1347.46 --> 1354.32]  Um, I mean, honestly speaking, if Apple didn't get.
[1354.32 --> 1357.84]  If Apple didn't get sued over.
[1358.08 --> 1358.36]  Okay.
[1358.64 --> 1364.14]  Do you remember back in the early days of smartphones when pretty much everything was an app?
[1364.58 --> 1368.80]  Like your flashlight flashlight flashlight, I think is the easiest example.
[1368.92 --> 1374.34]  That's the easiest example of something that used to be an app, but I'm sure you could pay
[1374.34 --> 1376.42]  for a flashlight app at some point.
[1376.42 --> 1382.56]  And the argument could be made that Apple and Google, you know, pulled the rug out from
[1382.56 --> 1388.84]  under these, these innovators and stole their lunch, um, and used their, their closed platform
[1388.84 --> 1390.26]  to, to shut them down.
[1391.82 --> 1397.86]  But the big difference here is that when, when Apple and Google, yeah.
[1397.86 --> 1397.94]  Wow.
[1398.16 --> 1406.16]  When Apple and Google integrated flashlight functionality into the, the, the shade or into the, what
[1406.16 --> 1406.48]  is it called?
[1406.54 --> 1407.82]  Control center on the iPhone.
[1408.38 --> 1411.24]  Um, I mean, they weren't called that back when these things were integrated.
[1411.34 --> 1411.76]  It doesn't matter.
[1411.84 --> 1416.42]  The point is when they integrated that feature, neither of them, to my knowledge, went and
[1416.42 --> 1420.64]  ripped flashlight apps off of the play store or the app store.
[1420.64 --> 1421.88]  Oh, wow.
[1421.88 --> 1426.60]  There's also something to be said for like, when, when, when companies bring up concerns
[1426.60 --> 1431.90]  about Sherlocking, it's especially when they're, they're talking about something that they might
[1431.90 --> 1434.04]  develop and they're talking to the platform about it.
[1434.40 --> 1440.96]  Um, a big concern comes into the potential, very deep overall investment, especially to
[1440.96 --> 1445.38]  the point of being able to crush the company that would go into developing this app just to
[1445.38 --> 1450.18]  potentially have it taken by the platform and implemented because the platforms app is almost
[1450.18 --> 1453.90]  all not technically always, but it's almost always going to win, especially cause it's
[1453.90 --> 1454.56]  usually free.
[1455.10 --> 1462.82]  Um, so with something like a flashlight app, um, I hate to dig on flashlight app developers
[1462.82 --> 1467.32]  from 15 years ago, but it's not exactly sophisticated.
[1467.46 --> 1472.46]  You turn the camera light on when the button's pressed and then you turn the camera light off
[1472.46 --> 1473.90]  when the button is pressed again.
[1474.28 --> 1479.98]  Um, a lot of Sherlocking concerns go into like really deep and heavy investment into
[1479.98 --> 1483.88]  things and then just having it be copied or stolen.
[1483.88 --> 1489.76]  Um, and, and this Sherlocking term is, is used very specifically in software, but we've seen
[1489.76 --> 1493.74]  a very similar type of activity from, from just throw another company under the bus,
[1494.10 --> 1499.12]  Amazon with Amazon basics, where they'll find, they'll find very publicly.
[1499.16 --> 1503.54]  They, they advertise this information like, wow, this is the top selling product in this
[1503.54 --> 1504.00]  category.
[1504.00 --> 1505.50]  Isn't that fantastic?
[1505.74 --> 1510.92]  What if Amazon sold something that's almost identical and probably cheaper and gets free
[1510.92 --> 1512.94]  shipping naturally and all this kind of stuff, ha ha ha.
[1513.06 --> 1515.22]  And then they take that top selling spot over.
[1515.74 --> 1518.66]  Um, it's, it's very similar activity.
[1518.86 --> 1523.86]  It's the platform using its own platform to make sure that its feature wins.
[1524.32 --> 1529.74]  Um, and it can be very predatory, but I don't think it always necessarily is.
[1529.74 --> 1534.90]  There's some basic features like flashlight that I think they were just destined to do
[1534.90 --> 1535.54]  themselves.
[1536.16 --> 1540.60]  Um, and it's better this way anyways, because I'm very happy that turning on my flashlight
[1540.60 --> 1541.88]  doesn't serve me an ad anymore.
[1542.26 --> 1543.66]  Yeah, no kidding.
[1544.10 --> 1544.86]  I was stupid.
[1545.32 --> 1548.14]  Now your ad can just be built into your operating system.
[1548.60 --> 1549.00]  True.
[1550.80 --> 1553.94]  You can just have them all the time, but Hey, you get a free flashlight.
[1555.84 --> 1556.80]  Oh boy.
[1556.80 --> 1558.38]  So I guess, uh, this is great.
[1558.38 --> 1564.20]  Uh, you can totally tell that this was prepped by Jonathan Horst because his discussion question
[1564.20 --> 1566.62]  for it is, are you going to want to upgrade anything?
[1567.26 --> 1569.62]  The answer is maybe.
[1570.54 --> 1576.10]  As you guys have observed over the last couple of years, almost, I guess it's definitely been
[1576.10 --> 1576.74]  over a year.
[1577.14 --> 1582.28]  I have been rocking an Apple Watch Series 5 for quite some time now.
[1582.38 --> 1584.78]  So this is my Apple Watch Series 5.
[1584.78 --> 1590.30]  And, uh, as you probably noticed when I held it up there, my screen is cracked.
[1591.90 --> 1595.76]  So could a good upgrade for me be a Series 7?
[1596.26 --> 1597.90]  Well, you're going to still wear it to badminton.
[1598.30 --> 1598.70]  Possibly.
[1598.84 --> 1599.12]  Yeah.
[1599.26 --> 1605.34]  So that's what happened is I, I followed through on a smash and whipped the end of the racket.
[1605.48 --> 1610.26]  Fortunately, the racket survived because it's actually, no, I think the watch is worth more
[1610.26 --> 1610.82]  than the racket.
[1610.82 --> 1611.38]  Well, rats.
[1611.50 --> 1612.20]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[1612.28 --> 1616.24]  The point is at least one of them survived and it whacked the side.
[1616.36 --> 1620.42]  And then the funny thing is I actually did it again, like two weeks later and cracked it
[1620.42 --> 1620.78]  again.
[1621.30 --> 1626.56]  And after that second one, enough of the glass has kind of chipped away that I don't think
[1626.56 --> 1627.76]  it's really waterproof anymore.
[1627.86 --> 1630.02]  The point is it doesn't charge or turn on anymore.
[1630.64 --> 1632.46]  So it seems to be dead.
[1632.46 --> 1636.36]  But it lasted me well, telling me the time whenever I needed to know it.
[1636.48 --> 1639.32]  I didn't have it paired to an iPhone at any point.
[1640.26 --> 1642.86]  I didn't really, didn't really need to need to do that.
[1643.14 --> 1644.14]  Maybe this is a sign.
[1644.26 --> 1648.38]  Maybe this is a sign that it's time for me to try, start trying out some smart watches
[1648.38 --> 1652.96]  and see if I can find one that is not horrible to use.
[1653.06 --> 1654.68]  Jake swears by the Galaxy Watch.
[1654.68 --> 1659.76]  I was going to say doubt it, but okay, there's a contender.
[1659.94 --> 1660.42]  Sounds good.
[1660.80 --> 1661.26]  I don't know.
[1661.38 --> 1661.76]  I don't know.
[1661.90 --> 1662.38]  I'm, I'm.
[1662.50 --> 1663.76]  That's one of the issues with the iPad.
[1663.90 --> 1666.68]  It's like the main thing that you brought up as a competition is an e-reader.
[1667.20 --> 1668.42]  And it's like, oof.
[1669.90 --> 1671.38]  Like what else are you going to get?
[1671.66 --> 1675.54]  No, the main competition for the iPad is your old iPad.
[1676.10 --> 1676.50]  Oh yeah.
[1677.08 --> 1679.22]  They've been making, I mean, they've been making iPads.
[1679.28 --> 1680.36]  When did the iPad launch?
[1681.64 --> 1683.00]  iPad launch.
[1683.00 --> 1685.48]  It worked in Geek Squad when it launched.
[1685.60 --> 1686.96]  That was actually a crazy day.
[1687.14 --> 1687.32]  Yeah.
[1687.46 --> 1690.06]  iPad launched over 10 years ago.
[1690.24 --> 1694.38]  And the reality of it is anything once they went retina display.
[1694.50 --> 1698.34]  So anything made within the last like eight or nine years,
[1698.52 --> 1703.78]  other than Apple not updating the operating system and obsoleting it that way,
[1703.78 --> 1706.24]  and then the apps you need to use not working on it anymore.
[1706.24 --> 1711.56]  Other than that, what about your iPad doesn't still do exactly what you need it to do?
[1713.00 --> 1716.44]  Yeah, that's tough.
[1716.58 --> 1717.96]  Like when my grandparents needed an iPad.
[1717.96 --> 1719.30]  That was a conversation we brought up earlier, right?
[1719.56 --> 1721.10]  Like COVID video calls.
[1721.80 --> 1724.68]  I didn't even begin to consider a brand new one.
[1724.88 --> 1729.88]  I picked up a refurb one off Amazon that was a few generations old for a few hundred dollars.
[1730.02 --> 1733.10]  It's like, this is the most obvious move ever.
[1733.26 --> 1735.26]  Why on earth would I buy a brand new one?
[1735.26 --> 1737.56]  I can't think of any good reason.
[1738.40 --> 1740.92]  Other than that the new iPad mini does look pretty cool.
[1741.02 --> 1745.14]  But that's like, it's too enthusiast for the kind,
[1745.22 --> 1748.36]  the only reason I would buy an iPad is to buy it for someone who's not techie.
[1749.20 --> 1749.84]  Not for myself anymore.
[1749.84 --> 1753.00]  One said the battery, but like you could, you can just plug it in.
[1753.14 --> 1755.86]  If they're buying this specifically for video calls,
[1756.46 --> 1760.34]  they're probably not going to be like astronomically long.
[1760.56 --> 1762.72]  And you could just get a cable and it's going to be okay.
[1762.72 --> 1764.32]  And they're not on at all hours of the day.
[1764.94 --> 1765.34]  Exactly.
[1765.48 --> 1767.80]  Speaking of being on all hours of the day,
[1768.10 --> 1771.92]  you know how I have OLED-ed my life.
[1772.36 --> 1774.10]  Have I talked about that on the WAN show at all?
[1774.68 --> 1775.02]  Okay.
[1775.12 --> 1776.54]  So my whole life is OLED now.
[1776.54 --> 1779.80]  I'm using an Aorus F whatever it is,
[1779.86 --> 1782.30]  a 48 inch gaming monitor at home.
[1782.62 --> 1786.62]  I am running an LG GX or G10,
[1786.72 --> 1789.64]  G10, excuse me, a G10 77 inch in my living room.
[1789.78 --> 1792.54]  And at work, I'm using a C10.
[1793.16 --> 1794.24]  Is it C10 or C1?
[1794.36 --> 1794.88]  Can't remember.
[1795.26 --> 1798.60]  It's one of the, it's one of LG C series TVs, the 48 inch.
[1799.56 --> 1800.00]  Okay.
[1801.62 --> 1805.72]  My display at work, because I typically work with,
[1805.96 --> 1809.16]  I have that, actually, do you even need the thing?
[1809.90 --> 1810.44]  No, you don't.
[1810.82 --> 1812.54]  There's, you don't need a power toy for it
[1812.54 --> 1814.32]  unless I've also installed it at home.
[1814.32 --> 1818.22]  So I typically manage my windows within four quadrants.
[1818.32 --> 1820.46]  So I'll have my Microsoft Teams up here.
[1820.64 --> 1824.98]  I'll have my browser that usually has Trello open up here.
[1825.14 --> 1828.72]  I'll usually have my sheet or something I'm cross-referencing,
[1828.92 --> 1830.40]  like my sheet of video ideas over here.
[1830.44 --> 1831.84]  And then I'll have like my email over here.
[1832.08 --> 1832.72]  Oops, over here.
[1832.76 --> 1833.76]  And then I'll have my email over here.
[1833.80 --> 1835.34]  So I've got this, this routine.
[1835.34 --> 1839.06]  Well, if there's anything that OLEDs don't like,
[1839.96 --> 1845.14]  it's routine, mostly static content for hours and hours a day.
[1845.30 --> 1848.34]  And even though I've only been using it for,
[1848.60 --> 1853.56]  I don't know, one to two months as a desktop display,
[1853.56 --> 1858.66]  I already have very, very noticeable,
[1858.66 --> 1862.64]  like lines down the middle vertically
[1862.64 --> 1865.00]  and then across the middle horizontally.
[1866.00 --> 1868.12]  Oh man, I need my AC to turn on.
[1868.24 --> 1868.60]  There we go.
[1869.94 --> 1872.52]  So what I'm kind of wondering is,
[1872.62 --> 1873.46]  ladies and gentlemen,
[1873.96 --> 1876.64]  should we make, should we turn that into a video?
[1877.42 --> 1878.46]  You know, talk about,
[1879.02 --> 1881.58]  okay, after, after this period of time,
[1881.60 --> 1882.74]  and I'll have to check and see exactly
[1882.74 --> 1883.72]  how long I've been using it.
[1884.02 --> 1885.38]  After this period of time,
[1885.52 --> 1889.08]  what are my experiences like using a TV as a monitor?
[1889.32 --> 1890.26]  I think, absolutely.
[1890.74 --> 1894.20]  There's a lot of things that I hadn't really considered
[1894.20 --> 1897.88]  when I recommended that display as a monitor.
[1898.62 --> 1899.60]  For example,
[1901.66 --> 1902.50]  actually, you know, man,
[1902.58 --> 1903.18]  I should start,
[1903.30 --> 1905.44]  I should start writing some of these things down.
[1906.32 --> 1907.22]  Because this is all-
[1907.22 --> 1908.52]  Just start forming the script.
[1909.04 --> 1910.52]  Yeah, this is all, this is all content.
[1910.68 --> 1912.70]  You guys are, you guys are watching the process.
[1912.74 --> 1913.30]  Right now.
[1913.68 --> 1916.56]  So it's quite typical for me to send an email to myself.
[1917.08 --> 1918.46]  So OLED experience.
[1918.70 --> 1920.10]  You know, I want to talk about,
[1920.58 --> 1922.68]  you know, what it's like to not be able
[1922.68 --> 1924.50]  to have any desktop icons.
[1924.86 --> 1927.08]  You know, no, no wallpaper.
[1927.60 --> 1928.50]  Like I'm, I'm a no,
[1928.52 --> 1930.32]  I'm a no wallpaper man now.
[1930.38 --> 1932.06]  I've just, hiding the taskbar.
[1932.76 --> 1935.22]  Hiding the taskbar sucks.
[1935.22 --> 1940.20]  And not because there's anything wrong with just moving your mouse down,
[1940.20 --> 1945.60]  but because window management tends to be really annoying when you have the taskbar hidden.
[1946.28 --> 1949.88]  Either a window will go all the way down,
[1949.88 --> 1953.26]  and the bottom of it will be hidden behind the taskbar.
[1953.82 --> 1958.28]  Or sometimes they'll bug out and they'll get stuck above the taskbar.
[1958.48 --> 1961.50]  And then the taskbar will go down and then you've, you've got a gap.
[1961.70 --> 1962.98]  More often than not though,
[1963.06 --> 1968.14]  the problem is apps that go all the way down and then they'll have buttons.
[1968.14 --> 1971.88]  In fact, right now I have, yep.
[1972.10 --> 1972.34]  Okay.
[1972.56 --> 1973.20]  Check this out.
[1973.30 --> 1974.34]  I'm going to display,
[1974.48 --> 1976.10]  I have my email up.
[1976.16 --> 1976.76]  Hold on a second.
[1976.86 --> 1978.38]  Let me just make sure this is safe.
[1982.08 --> 1985.86]  I want to be really good and sure that I'm not leaking anything here.
[1987.16 --> 1987.56]  Okay.
[1987.90 --> 1989.18]  See you later that.
[1990.46 --> 1990.86]  Okay.
[1991.06 --> 1991.28]  Yep.
[1991.38 --> 1991.56]  Yeah.
[1991.60 --> 1992.24]  I think I'm good.
[1992.34 --> 1992.96]  I think I'm good.
[1993.08 --> 1993.64]  I hope I'm good.
[1993.72 --> 1994.38]  Okay, here we go.
[1995.08 --> 1996.30]  So here I am.
[1996.30 --> 1998.10]  I'm making up a little script for myself.
[1998.42 --> 2001.56]  So let's go all the way down to the bottom of my display where look at this.
[2002.00 --> 2004.26]  There is a button right here.
[2004.62 --> 2005.32]  See that?
[2005.92 --> 2009.16]  And it is covered by my taskbar, which wait, watch this.
[2010.50 --> 2012.22]  Doesn't auto hide right now.
[2012.50 --> 2015.98]  Cause sometimes just he no auto hide.
[2016.72 --> 2017.40]  That's it.
[2017.54 --> 2018.88]  He just, he just stayed there.
[2019.66 --> 2023.74]  And we can easily, we can easily verify my taskbar settings.
[2024.20 --> 2025.40]  Automatically hide the taskbar.
[2025.40 --> 2026.94]  Uh, yeah, a little bit.
[2027.66 --> 2027.90]  Okay.
[2027.90 --> 2029.08]  You're going to hide now, buddy.
[2029.72 --> 2030.70]  You're going to hide now.
[2030.74 --> 2031.30]  What do you think?
[2031.76 --> 2032.10]  No.
[2032.46 --> 2032.90]  Okay.
[2033.34 --> 2033.78]  Okay.
[2034.48 --> 2037.04]  He no, he no want, he don't want to auto hide.
[2038.18 --> 2040.72]  So what am I supposed to do about that?
[2040.72 --> 2052.02]  Um, and it's obviously not a problem if you don't hide the taskbar, but I would strongly recommend that if you're using an OLED display that you hide the taskbar.
[2052.02 --> 2054.94]  So it's just something that you're kind of stuck with.
[2054.94 --> 2058.24]  I'm so glad that it happened to bug out live.
[2058.24 --> 2060.78]  Because that's something I can actually integrate into the video now.
[2060.78 --> 2062.28]  Uh, it doesn't work sometimes.
[2062.28 --> 2063.94]  Stuff hides behind it.
[2063.94 --> 2066.96]  Um, burn in.
[2067.12 --> 2068.22]  Uh, oh man.
[2068.72 --> 2071.58]  The auto dimming and brightening.
[2071.58 --> 2081.06]  Now, apparently there's a way to go into the, like the service menu on those LG TVs.
[2081.06 --> 2082.90]  And you can actually adjust that.
[2083.28 --> 2086.36]  You can tell it, okay, never auto brighten or never auto dim.
[2086.36 --> 2095.96]  But otherwise, anytime you load up a full screen content that is, that is all white, for example, it will, it will drastically dim the display.
[2095.96 --> 2100.42]  And that's for both power management as well as to protect the panel.
[2100.66 --> 2104.86]  But what can be even more annoying than that, because that honestly doesn't bother me.
[2104.94 --> 2107.34]  Usually I would actually prefer it to be dimmer.
[2107.42 --> 2113.08]  What bothers me more is when you have a really small part of the screen that's white, it can end up being a searing white.
[2113.08 --> 2119.32]  Even when you are not using HDR, just because, uh, the entire panel will go, oh, okay, we've got lots of power.
[2119.40 --> 2120.12]  Here we go, boys.
[2120.16 --> 2120.94]  Let's juice it up.
[2121.40 --> 2130.94]  So, getting that tuned is, um, is something you can do, but it doesn't change the, the jarring experience of it.
[2131.00 --> 2133.88]  Kind of turning up, turning down, turning up, turning down.
[2134.24 --> 2141.32]  And both the monitor, the Aorus monitor that I'm using at home and the LG TV that I have at work are kind of problematic.
[2141.32 --> 2147.06]  Now, neither of them are problematic enough that I'm anywhere near swapping them out for a conventional display.
[2147.26 --> 2149.74]  But the burn-in is a big problem.
[2149.86 --> 2163.96]  I've been gaming a little bit more lately, and I've noticed that in the, behind my crosshair, um, I'll have this larger, this larger crosshair all the way, all the way along the display.
[2164.14 --> 2166.42]  And it's, it's not the best.
[2166.60 --> 2169.22]  If that's accurate, that could, that could maybe happen, uh, help with no scoping.
[2169.22 --> 2170.56]  Oh, yeah, thanks for that, Luke.
[2170.66 --> 2171.72]  That, that's what I want.
[2171.82 --> 2173.08]  You're getting a gaming advantage.
[2173.36 --> 2178.70]  I want to destroy, uh, a several thousand dollar, couple thousand dollar display.
[2179.32 --> 2182.38]  Just so that I can have, uh, a big crosshair.
[2182.90 --> 2183.18]  Yeah.
[2183.32 --> 2184.12]  Thank you for that.
[2184.68 --> 2184.84]  Awesome.
[2184.84 --> 2186.24]  They're absolutely terrible.
[2186.54 --> 2186.98]  Atrocious.
[2187.18 --> 2190.14]  Speaking of something else to, to thank someone for.
[2190.24 --> 2192.82]  Dan, I had a way better segue earlier, but it's been too long.
[2192.90 --> 2193.28]  Sponsors?
[2193.28 --> 2200.04]  Yeah, let's thank, let's thank Jake Belavance for being the one person on the business team that's actually in office this week.
[2200.40 --> 2200.54]  Hey!
[2200.70 --> 2203.54]  See Sonic sponsored today's video.
[2203.82 --> 2210.30]  Their Prime Ultra Titanium PC power supplies feature ultra high efficiency with their 80 plus titanium rating.
[2210.66 --> 2219.66]  They are fully modular, feature hybrid fan control to control overall noise, and they have fluid dynamic bearings so that even when the fans spin up, they don't sound too loud.
[2219.66 --> 2225.92]  They offer up to a 50,000 hour life expectancy along with a 12 year warranty to match.
[2226.02 --> 2231.34]  And you can check them out at the link down below or on See Sonic's website.
[2231.68 --> 2235.64]  Oh, or at the See Sonic link or the, uh, Amazon link.
[2235.78 --> 2237.22]  Oh, hilarious.
[2237.62 --> 2243.48]  Uh, we don't have the Amazon link this week because, uh, Bell doesn't normally, this is great.
[2243.84 --> 2248.72]  Bell doesn't normally do the sponsor links, so I don't think he really knows the normal format.
[2248.72 --> 2250.20]  So, that's okay.
[2250.64 --> 2252.50]  I've, I've updated, I've updated it now.
[2252.58 --> 2263.92]  You might have to refresh the page on YouTube or something like that if you actually want to go follow the link, which of course I would recommend you do because checking out our sponsors helps us out a lot.
[2264.70 --> 2267.56]  All right, let's see if I can catch this fast enough that I don't hear it.
[2267.64 --> 2267.80]  Nope.
[2267.80 --> 2271.26]  Man, that live feed loads up fast on floatplane, don't it?
[2271.72 --> 2276.70]  Finally, the show is brought to you today by, oh, this is a little awkward.
[2276.88 --> 2277.64]  Hold on a second.
[2278.02 --> 2279.94]  Bellavance sent me a thing earlier.
[2280.38 --> 2281.54]  Weird copy warning.
[2281.72 --> 2285.54]  Today's WAN show sponsor, .tech Domains, is raising money for charity.
[2286.42 --> 2289.72]  Uh, but then that's not in my list of sponsors right now.
[2290.04 --> 2291.62]  This is the best thing about live shows.
[2291.70 --> 2292.58]  You know what I'm going to throw in?
[2292.58 --> 2294.00]  I'll throw in .tech as well.
[2294.50 --> 2296.68]  Uh, the show is also brought to you by Ridge Wallet.
[2296.82 --> 2302.40]  Stop carrying pointless items around in your pockets like receipts, old hotel room keys, or spent gift cards.
[2302.58 --> 2309.88]  Ridge Wallet helps you carry less by using two metal plates that are bound together with a strong elastic band to keep your cards tightly together but still accessible.
[2310.34 --> 2315.12]  They're RFID blocking and they offer a lifetime guarantee and are available in aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium.
[2315.12 --> 2316.76]  They don't just sell wallets, though.
[2316.82 --> 2319.24]  They have battery banks, bags, smartphone covers, and more.
[2319.34 --> 2324.58]  And you can use offer code WAN to save 10% on everything at ridge.com slash WAN.
[2324.82 --> 2327.06]  Wow, that message from Bell was from May.
[2327.46 --> 2329.42]  Bell does not message me very often.
[2329.88 --> 2331.04]  Um, okay then.
[2331.16 --> 2332.72]  I had totally forgotten about that.
[2333.28 --> 2334.88]  What are we going to talk about next, Luke?
[2335.76 --> 2343.06]  Apparently, uh, some, some people mentioned that your, your taskbar isn't hiding because of notifications.
[2343.06 --> 2345.30]  Because of notifications?
[2345.76 --> 2348.24]  Well, it's hiding right now and I have notifications.
[2350.52 --> 2351.96]  I have 11 notifications.
[2353.42 --> 2355.44]  Are they, are they new notifications?
[2355.84 --> 2357.84]  They are, it's, I moused over it.
[2357.86 --> 2359.22]  It says 11 new notifications.
[2360.90 --> 2362.02]  What do you want from me?
[2362.54 --> 2362.92]  I don't know.
[2363.32 --> 2364.02]  That's all I had.
[2364.18 --> 2364.62]  All right.
[2365.04 --> 2365.62]  Got them.
[2366.22 --> 2367.38]  Okay, moving on.
[2367.98 --> 2370.78]  Why don't we talk about the new TV I'm going to buy?
[2371.46 --> 2371.86]  Yes.
[2371.86 --> 2373.76]  Oh wait, you're just doing it?
[2373.90 --> 2375.30]  Like this isn't even a...
[2375.30 --> 2381.86]  LG's new 325 inch 8k TV takes up the whole wall.
[2382.10 --> 2383.42]  They should totally call it that.
[2383.68 --> 2388.14]  Samsung's going to have the wall and LG's going to have the whole wall.
[2388.58 --> 2393.26]  And costs 1.7 million dollars.
[2393.80 --> 2396.00]  1.7 million.
[2396.14 --> 2398.20]  Okay, this is an awful Photoshop.
[2398.20 --> 2403.28]  Like, what, what, what, where, what are these shadows coming from?
[2404.02 --> 2404.46]  Right?
[2405.74 --> 2407.36]  What are we looking at here?
[2407.42 --> 2408.32]  I have no idea.
[2408.40 --> 2409.24]  And these people.
[2409.82 --> 2412.44]  Look at the, look at them relative to the couch.
[2412.52 --> 2414.04]  They're not, this is not a picture.
[2414.20 --> 2417.50]  This is very obviously, yeah, it's, it's awful.
[2417.58 --> 2417.96]  It's awful.
[2418.42 --> 2418.82]  But.
[2418.98 --> 2421.88]  You know, the shadows are, what do you mean where are the shadows coming from?
[2421.88 --> 2424.16]  I mean, where are the shadows coming from?
[2424.24 --> 2424.82]  Here, Luke.
[2425.22 --> 2428.50]  Where is, where is this shadow coming from?
[2429.90 --> 2431.02]  I can't see.
[2431.36 --> 2433.34]  Oh, I think I get it.
[2433.44 --> 2436.30]  I think the shadow is coming from back here.
[2436.58 --> 2436.80]  Yeah.
[2436.96 --> 2437.58]  Oh, okay.
[2437.68 --> 2437.90]  Okay.
[2437.90 --> 2442.40]  The sun's coming in through the windows that are behind the terribly Photoshopped in people.
[2442.40 --> 2445.04]  I mean, it's still terribly Photoshopped.
[2445.04 --> 2445.76]  It is, yeah.
[2445.90 --> 2446.98]  But the shadows are, yeah.
[2447.14 --> 2447.54]  All right.
[2447.62 --> 2447.88]  All right.
[2447.96 --> 2448.50]  But, okay.
[2448.60 --> 2451.62]  But the plant here, the plant here has a shadow that goes this way.
[2451.96 --> 2453.14]  So, no, no, no.
[2453.20 --> 2453.90]  It's still bad.
[2453.96 --> 2454.52]  It's still bad.
[2454.58 --> 2457.36]  It's just not bad in exactly the way that I thought it was bad.
[2458.08 --> 2460.52]  This thing looks freaking crazy.
[2460.52 --> 2467.78]  So, this is their new lineup of direct view LED or DV LED extreme home cinema sets.
[2467.98 --> 2470.28]  And they are going full bore.
[2470.44 --> 2472.94]  Like, Samsung only has, what?
[2473.02 --> 2478.02]  They have their professional and then they have their high-end consumer, like their luxury one.
[2478.58 --> 2479.02]  LG?
[2480.26 --> 2482.52]  Man, they're calling these all home cinema.
[2482.52 --> 2488.94]  They have four different sizes of 1080p or, excuse me, 2K.
[2489.58 --> 2490.46]  So, I don't know.
[2490.58 --> 2492.22]  I don't really know what they mean by that.
[2492.28 --> 2496.68]  I don't know if they mean 2048 by 1080 or if they mean 1920 by 1080.
[2496.82 --> 2497.34]  Hard to say.
[2497.72 --> 2503.04]  But 81 inch, 108, 136, 163, and 215 inch.
[2503.30 --> 2504.38]  All of those are 1080.
[2504.86 --> 2511.08]  Then, they've got 163, 217, 271, and 325 inch 4K displays.
[2511.08 --> 2514.98]  And the Chungus, the 8K, 325 inch.
[2515.04 --> 2516.04]  These things are bananas.
[2516.70 --> 2520.78]  Peak brightness is, okay, viewing angles first up to 190.
[2521.24 --> 2521.62]  No, sorry.
[2521.80 --> 2522.28]  What is this?
[2523.22 --> 2523.70]  Oh, wow.
[2523.82 --> 2524.24]  No, okay.
[2524.34 --> 2529.06]  So, they have ultra wide or like, sorry, extra ultra wide.
[2529.12 --> 2530.14]  I don't know what you would call this.
[2530.18 --> 2536.04]  But this looks like a 16 by 9, 32 by 9 aspect ratio right here.
[2536.78 --> 2538.30]  4K displays at challenge convention.
[2538.42 --> 2540.36]  Okay, where's the bloody specs of this thing?
[2541.08 --> 2541.50]  Wait, what?
[2541.78 --> 2542.50]  Download catalog.
[2542.80 --> 2545.52]  Okay, I clearly haven't prepared this topic.
[2545.64 --> 2547.08]  So, you're going to have to give me a minute here.
[2547.16 --> 2549.66]  I just wanted to marvel at it with you guys.
[2550.38 --> 2551.68]  Where's our brightness here?
[2552.04 --> 2553.98]  The knit brightness refers to...
[2553.98 --> 2554.32]  Oh, wow.
[2554.38 --> 2558.22]  They just have a whole glossary of terms before they actually start telling you...
[2558.22 --> 2559.00]  Check out the flyer.
[2559.18 --> 2559.90]  Anything about it.
[2559.90 --> 2560.14]  Check out the flyer.
[2560.72 --> 2561.10]  Oh, yeah.
[2561.18 --> 2562.84]  Oh, we've got all the info.
[2562.84 --> 2566.08]  LG's got like a whole sales sheet here.
[2566.54 --> 2568.18]  So, the 136 inch...
[2569.18 --> 2571.18]  Sorry, 2K.
[2571.26 --> 2571.78]  I guess I'll call it...
[2571.78 --> 2572.52]  No, 1080p.
[2572.86 --> 2573.36]  Full HD.
[2573.52 --> 2574.60]  I'm going to call it full HD.
[2575.14 --> 2576.16]  800 nits peak.
[2576.24 --> 2577.44]  So, that's not that crazy.
[2577.86 --> 2578.96]  Even compared to an OLED.
[2579.10 --> 2580.38]  That's not crazy bright.
[2580.90 --> 2583.20]  The dual one does 1200 nits though.
[2583.58 --> 2586.18]  The 108 inch does 1200 nits.
[2586.18 --> 2592.14]  Then, the 196 inch, which is the two 1080p side by side, does 1200 nits.
[2592.22 --> 2592.96]  Man, for gaming?
[2593.62 --> 2594.86]  That would be sick.
[2595.14 --> 2595.98]  I am amazed.
[2596.14 --> 2597.90]  They don't just have a game running here.
[2598.00 --> 2601.14]  Who would have all this different content that they're watching at the same time?
[2601.26 --> 2601.54]  That's...
[2601.54 --> 2602.38]  Yeah, I loved...
[2602.38 --> 2603.18]  That was like...
[2603.76 --> 2605.00]  That's my favorite part of the page show.
[2605.06 --> 2608.26]  I know the horrible photoshopping is hilarious.
[2608.60 --> 2611.18]  But, all these scenes that are just...
[2612.82 --> 2614.92]  Especially the hockey one.
[2614.92 --> 2617.88]  Being so unrealistic is just so funny.
[2618.00 --> 2619.00]  Where's the hockey one?
[2620.34 --> 2622.16]  On the 8K Magnific...
[2622.16 --> 2623.24]  Sorry, I can't see what you're looking at.
[2623.26 --> 2624.76]  I'll make my way down there.
[2625.10 --> 2626.22]  I'll make my way down there.
[2626.62 --> 2628.42]  So, around 1200 nits.
[2629.18 --> 2630.76]  Holy crap.
[2631.22 --> 2639.10]  The 163 inch sucks back 4,000 watts and weighs 556 pounds.
[2639.66 --> 2640.08]  Wow.
[2641.20 --> 2642.56]  Hoo-wee, boys!
[2642.56 --> 2645.04]  That is unreal.
[2645.20 --> 2650.50]  Each pixel is about one millimeter by one millimeter.
[2650.82 --> 2653.08]  So, these are fairly gigantic pixels.
[2653.24 --> 2657.76]  You're going to want to be pretty far back from a 4K 163 inch display.
[2658.52 --> 2662.66]  Here's the 8K one with the hockey thing that Luke was talking about.
[2662.66 --> 2665.88]  So, this one manages 1200 nits peak brightness.
[2666.60 --> 2667.84]  It's IP20?
[2668.30 --> 2668.82]  Like, it's...
[2668.82 --> 2669.34]  What is this?
[2669.50 --> 2671.12]  It's water resistant?
[2672.12 --> 2674.54]  I got to double check what IP20 means.
[2674.88 --> 2683.78]  It weighs 2,200 pounds and consumes 16,000 watts peak.
[2684.62 --> 2688.06]  Luke, 16,000 watts!
[2688.72 --> 2689.50]  That's awesome.
[2689.94 --> 2690.22]  That's very cool.
[2690.22 --> 2691.32]  What is going on?
[2691.66 --> 2692.76]  What is life even?
[2693.28 --> 2694.28]  Hold on a second.
[2694.72 --> 2696.32]  16,560.
[2696.48 --> 2696.74]  Okay.
[2697.06 --> 2698.32]  So, divided by 115.
[2699.32 --> 2703.28]  That is 144 amps.
[2703.28 --> 2709.92]  assuming that it was on, like, a North American 115 volt circuit.
[2709.92 --> 2720.22]  That is literally larger than the electrical service that is provisioned to my house right now.
[2720.22 --> 2726.52]  That does my range, my air conditioning, my car charger, all my lights, all my computers.
[2726.52 --> 2731.52]  By the way, did you say it was IP20?
[2732.60 --> 2733.08]  I did.
[2733.90 --> 2734.84]  I looked up IP20.
[2734.92 --> 2744.30]  IP20 rating means the product is touchproof and will be resistant to dust or other objects that are over 12 millimeters in size.
[2744.38 --> 2746.34]  It's not water resistant.
[2746.82 --> 2747.74]  Oh, my God.
[2747.74 --> 2754.08]  It has no production whatsoever against liquids and will be susceptible to damage if it comes in contact with sprays or water.
[2755.14 --> 2756.74]  Oh, my God.
[2756.82 --> 2760.00]  The display comes in a flight case.
[2760.14 --> 2760.74]  Flight case.
[2760.98 --> 2761.26]  Yeah.
[2761.26 --> 2768.38]  While some may say they're overkill, LG believes they make perfect sense.
[2768.66 --> 2769.18]  Okay.
[2771.46 --> 2773.98]  On flipping real.
[2775.30 --> 2776.24]  Man, it really is.
[2776.24 --> 2778.92]  No more searching to make sure you received every box.
[2779.30 --> 2780.60]  It really is too bad.
[2780.70 --> 2786.38]  I spent all of my giant TV money on framework stock because.
[2786.60 --> 2787.20]  Way better.
[2787.66 --> 2789.22]  You think it was a better move?
[2789.30 --> 2790.16]  You think it was a better move?
[2790.16 --> 2795.08]  Dude, ah, I just keep watching more content about the laptop and I just want it more.
[2795.20 --> 2797.82]  But I'm too cheap, so I'm not going to buy it until my blade dies.
[2799.22 --> 2801.14]  Well, that should be soon enough.
[2801.68 --> 2802.88]  It's a matter of time.
[2802.88 --> 2805.72]  I mean, it's lived this long because I rarely use it.
[2805.90 --> 2807.60]  It's when, not if at this point.
[2807.98 --> 2811.10]  Does anyone have any pricing for the in-between sizes?
[2811.20 --> 2815.66]  Because I don't actually see any of that information on LG's website.
[2815.66 --> 2823.20]  They've got all this amazing, you know, here's all these reasons you should want it, but no actual way to buy it.
[2823.62 --> 2824.48]  This is interesting.
[2824.70 --> 2829.76]  Just like Samsung's The Wall, there's a separate controller box.
[2829.86 --> 2831.22]  So it runs webOS.
[2831.74 --> 2834.72]  Wait, clicking on that just takes you back to the top of the page?
[2834.72 --> 2842.68]  Can you imagine, can you imagine, Luke, designing a page for a $1.7 million product that has a broken link on it?
[2844.24 --> 2846.12]  How embarrassing is that?
[2848.16 --> 2850.12]  Everything I can try to Google.
[2850.24 --> 2852.28]  Like, I have SKUs for every single one of them.
[2853.64 --> 2854.36]  Oh, yeah.
[2854.42 --> 2856.38]  I can't find pricing based off the SKUs.
[2856.50 --> 2857.36]  Here, the flyer.
[2857.44 --> 2861.18]  The flyer is a way more information-dense version.
[2861.68 --> 2863.02]  I told you to look at the flyer.
[2863.02 --> 2866.14]  Oh, my God.
[2866.24 --> 2867.06]  This is hilarious.
[2867.24 --> 2868.36]  Now, I heard this.
[2868.62 --> 2875.26]  I heard this from an installer who works with a lot of these micro-LED and direct-view LED panels
[2875.26 --> 2879.88]  that apparently dead panels are just a fact of life.
[2880.08 --> 2884.52]  And the installers are constantly going back to these things to replace defective panels.
[2884.52 --> 2892.52]  That was actually one of the big reasons that I just pieced on the whole idea, aside from the money.
[2893.02 --> 2893.94]  Get this.
[2894.12 --> 2899.30]  LG includes 5% spare modules in the box.
[2899.62 --> 2902.12]  So, you're going to be ready to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2902.80 --> 2907.24]  You're going to be ready to go with spare modules, spare boards and parts,
[2907.24 --> 2911.88]  all of the direct-view LED panels, and the 4K LG controller.
[2912.02 --> 2913.06]  No problem.
[2913.06 --> 2918.38]  Also, on-site training prior to installation with an LG field engineer.
[2919.66 --> 2920.14]  What?
[2920.38 --> 2921.28]  So, they don't...
[2921.28 --> 2921.88]  Oh, wow.
[2922.36 --> 2926.84]  My understanding is Samsung only does this through approved installers.
[2926.92 --> 2929.32]  But I guess LG is just like, no, go for it, dog.
[2929.86 --> 2931.18]  We'll train you.
[2931.78 --> 2933.38]  A field engineer will train you.
[2933.62 --> 2934.20]  Oh, be ready.
[2934.28 --> 2935.50]  With in-person support from LG.
[2935.64 --> 2936.10]  Okay, no, no.
[2936.20 --> 2937.82]  The in-person support from LG.
[2938.02 --> 2938.22]  Okay.
[2938.92 --> 2943.66]  Five years extended care warranty is included with optional white glove replacement.
[2943.78 --> 2944.20]  And here you go.
[2944.26 --> 2945.30]  Here's the specs.
[2946.46 --> 2948.42]  So, max brightness.
[2948.42 --> 2949.78]  This may be...
[2949.78 --> 2952.16]  This is probably different from peak brightness.
[2952.16 --> 2958.94]  It is worth noting that these don't even have exactly the same types of LED packages.
[2959.36 --> 2961.80]  So, we've got surface mount diodes.
[2961.98 --> 2963.96]  Most of them appear to be SMD.
[2964.60 --> 2966.48]  But then what are these...
[2966.48 --> 2967.94]  What are these C...
[2967.94 --> 2969.72]  C-O-B ones?
[2969.92 --> 2972.78]  I have not actually seen that term before.
[2972.88 --> 2974.20]  What is a C-O-B...
[2974.20 --> 2976.82]  C-O-B LED?
[2977.90 --> 2978.94]  Chip on board.
[2979.20 --> 2979.38]  Chip on board.
[2979.64 --> 2980.00]  Okay.
[2980.00 --> 2983.62]  So, what is the last one?
[2983.70 --> 2985.04]  Because there's another one.
[2985.12 --> 2985.24]  Shoot.
[2985.30 --> 2987.44]  I accidentally closed the thing.
[2987.52 --> 2988.26]  What's the last one called?
[2988.30 --> 2988.90]  Do you still have it?
[2989.74 --> 2990.18]  IMD.
[2991.50 --> 2991.90]  IMD.
[2992.14 --> 2992.46]  Okay.
[2992.72 --> 2993.76]  What's an IMD?
[2994.76 --> 2995.68]  IMD LED.
[2997.36 --> 2998.40]  IMD technology.
[2999.42 --> 2999.78]  Integrated.
[3000.48 --> 3000.74]  Come on.
[3000.78 --> 3000.98]  Come on.
[3001.00 --> 3001.18]  Come on.
[3001.20 --> 3001.40]  Come on.
[3001.40 --> 3001.58]  Come on.
[3001.60 --> 3001.76]  Come on.
[3001.76 --> 3001.98]  Come on.
[3001.98 --> 3002.00]  Come on.
[3002.06 --> 3002.76]  Load this page.
[3004.76 --> 3005.18]  Okay.
[3005.26 --> 3009.84]  According to waveandco.com, it is integrated packaging.
[3010.00 --> 3011.72]  Integrated matrix devices.
[3014.40 --> 3014.96]  Fascinating.
[3016.16 --> 3016.72]  Man.
[3017.38 --> 3019.18]  This is such a weird launch.
[3020.44 --> 3020.96]  Imagine...
[3020.96 --> 3026.76]  People in slow plane chat are saying that the chip on board ones are like huge and super spaced apart.
[3027.74 --> 3028.50]  Got it.
[3028.56 --> 3028.88]  Got it.
[3028.92 --> 3029.18]  Got it.
[3029.18 --> 3039.08]  So, basically, you're choosing between optimal brightness versus optimal density because the chip on board ones don't appear to go as bright.
[3040.08 --> 3040.50]  Oh.
[3040.56 --> 3043.76]  For whatever reason, I do not have that window again.
[3045.12 --> 3046.72]  Sounds like it would be kind of bad for both.
[3046.72 --> 3049.38]  The links open in the same tab.
[3050.40 --> 3050.84]  So...
[3050.84 --> 3053.68]  What's interesting is that the actual size of the...
[3053.68 --> 3054.76]  Or the pitch of the pixels.
[3054.90 --> 3061.82]  So, the size of the individual pixels appears to be similar between the different technologies, at least on some of the SKUs.
[3062.02 --> 3063.78]  But the brightness is different.
[3064.34 --> 3070.74]  So, SMD surface mount appears to get the lowest peak brightness, except where it doesn't.
[3071.08 --> 3072.56]  Except where it gets the highest.
[3072.74 --> 3073.02]  Yeah.
[3073.02 --> 3074.00]  It's so confusing.
[3074.00 --> 3075.38]  All over the place.
[3075.68 --> 3075.82]  Yeah.
[3076.02 --> 3076.86]  There's two SMD ones.
[3076.94 --> 3078.92]  So, this is just ultimately...
[3080.06 --> 3083.84]  Gotta be a major pricing difference, but I can't find pricing for almost any of this.
[3084.34 --> 3084.58]  Yeah.
[3084.62 --> 3085.52]  That kind of makes sense.
[3085.58 --> 3089.68]  This is the kind of thing, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
[3089.76 --> 3092.36]  So, what's the point of even listing it?
[3092.68 --> 3096.00]  Did you see the, like, total care health checks and stuff like that?
[3096.10 --> 3096.52]  No.
[3096.86 --> 3097.86]  What are the health checks?
[3098.14 --> 3102.10]  It comes with three years of LG total care health checks,
[3102.10 --> 3108.58]  which means twice per year, someone will show up for on-site display health checks.
[3109.18 --> 3109.60]  Wow.
[3110.52 --> 3111.56]  That's pretty good.
[3112.28 --> 3115.30]  And you will also get priority on any RMA services.
[3115.92 --> 3119.82]  I think that's technically unrelated to the health checks,
[3119.98 --> 3123.00]  but if they noticed any problems during the health check, I'm sure it would apply.
[3123.00 --> 3130.52]  So, they're just owning that these things are gonna fail, and they're gonna fail hard.
[3130.92 --> 3132.96]  And they're just like, yeah, but we'll take care of it.
[3133.74 --> 3134.22]  Yeah.
[3134.38 --> 3134.64]  Okay.
[3134.64 --> 3139.20]  I think that the answer is projector.
[3139.92 --> 3144.46]  I got some good advice from, oh, man.
[3144.60 --> 3145.88]  What's, oh.
[3147.28 --> 3153.58]  At First Reflect on Twitter, Rob hit me with some fantastic advice.
[3153.58 --> 3158.26]  JVC has some new stuff that is just out now.
[3158.66 --> 3165.32]  The NZ9 is, it does 4K 120 with frame-by-frame dynamic tone mapping for HDR.
[3165.72 --> 3167.32]  Has HDR 10 plus support.
[3167.54 --> 3169.14]  No, it'll be vision, but it is expected.
[3169.38 --> 3175.78]  Genuine 4K res DILA panels that can shift four times per frame for full 8K res to your eye.
[3176.30 --> 3179.62]  3,000 lumens only, but this is gonna be a light controlled room.
[3179.62 --> 3189.00]  Um, he's like, yeah, you could go GTZ 380, which is that Sony 10,000 nit laser projector,
[3189.20 --> 3194.36]  but he figures this is much more appropriate, both in terms of physical size and noise levels
[3194.36 --> 3198.30]  for the kind of room that we're gonna be in, and the kind of screen size that we're gonna have.
[3198.38 --> 3202.22]  So, I think I'm just going to, at the very least, explore that option.
[3202.28 --> 3202.94]  I'm gonna try it.
[3202.96 --> 3207.66]  I'm gonna try one more time to go projector and see if I absolutely hate it,
[3207.66 --> 3213.80]  and hopefully by the time I give up on it, I will be able to go direct view LED of some sort
[3213.80 --> 3215.76]  and ditch it.
[3216.04 --> 3221.28]  But, as long as it's, as long as it's modules, Luke, I just, man,
[3221.48 --> 3227.78]  I don't know if I could handle seeing seams on my hundred thousand plus dollar TV.
[3228.82 --> 3234.18]  And the, the, whenever, like, okay, so there's, there's a bit of a dichotomy, right?
[3234.18 --> 3238.86]  Because we wanted to see failure rate when we were looking at manufacturing on those tours we went on.
[3239.06 --> 3240.00]  Cool, cool, cool, whatever.
[3240.38 --> 3245.04]  But when there's brands that are like, yup, we'll send a person out twice a year,
[3245.10 --> 3248.76]  and you get priority RMA as an advertising thing,
[3249.14 --> 3252.88]  mainstayed in the very middle of the page, that's a concern.
[3253.44 --> 3257.88]  That, like, that seems consistent about all of these, like, module TVs.
[3257.88 --> 3262.44]  They sound like they fail like crazy, the pixels are spaced really far apart,
[3262.74 --> 3265.92]  brightness seems to be a bit of an issue, even though it's direct view,
[3266.36 --> 3271.18]  and there's seams between the modules, and just, it's really expensive,
[3271.26 --> 3273.28]  it takes a bajillion watts of power.
[3273.54 --> 3273.62]  Yeah.
[3273.76 --> 3275.80]  Like, just, I don't know, it doesn't.
[3276.34 --> 3278.66]  It doesn't appear to make a lot of sense.
[3279.16 --> 3279.48]  No.
[3279.48 --> 3282.84]  Gondomar asks, hey, Linus, why don't you put the projector in another room,
[3282.92 --> 3283.80]  like at a movie theater?
[3284.46 --> 3287.78]  Because at the very high end of what I have left to spend,
[3287.84 --> 3291.40]  I really did spend my projector budget on framework stonks.
[3293.24 --> 3295.90]  Because at the very high end of what I have to spend,
[3295.98 --> 3297.38]  I'm still looking at a JVC.
[3297.64 --> 3299.62]  I'm not looking at a Christie, okay?
[3300.30 --> 3302.84]  I don't have a hundred grand to spend on a projector.
[3303.26 --> 3306.66]  And I actually don't know where they're, they're, they're super cool, man.
[3306.66 --> 3308.04]  It's cool technology, right?
[3308.12 --> 3310.70]  They've got the main projection unit outside of the room,
[3310.82 --> 3313.46]  and then an optical link to a head unit.
[3313.80 --> 3316.64]  So it's completely silent in the theater room.
[3317.48 --> 3319.36]  That is sick.
[3320.64 --> 3324.20]  Oh, Alex the Noob says, went to a Sony Onyx LED Cinema.
[3325.02 --> 3327.14]  Sony Onyx, what is Onyx LED?
[3328.20 --> 3330.30]  Is that what they call Cletus now?
[3331.94 --> 3335.14]  I had, I had, I had a shower thought the other day.
[3335.14 --> 3338.34]  I don't remember when this was, but I was thinking about you and your-
[3338.34 --> 3339.80]  Oh, Samsung, they said Samsung.
[3340.08 --> 3342.32]  I think the, our poster was a little bit confused.
[3342.46 --> 3342.90]  Okay, go ahead.
[3343.44 --> 3345.22]  I was thinking about you and your TV problem.
[3345.68 --> 3349.28]  And this, this isn't a good, this isn't a good solution
[3349.28 --> 3352.02]  because there's travel involved, unfortunately.
[3352.26 --> 3354.40]  But I was thinking at some of the costs,
[3354.50 --> 3356.96]  like, like Barrington just posted in the flow plane chat.
[3357.04 --> 3358.48]  Let me scroll up and see if I can find it.
[3358.58 --> 3358.82]  Yeah.
[3358.82 --> 3359.50]  Yeah.
[3361.04 --> 3364.58]  CNET says the third, 325 inch is $1.7 million.
[3364.98 --> 3365.68]  I did know that.
[3365.68 --> 3367.94]  At that point, just anytime you want to watch something,
[3368.18 --> 3369.38]  just rent out a theater.
[3370.34 --> 3373.34]  It would probably genuinely be significantly cheaper.
[3373.58 --> 3375.46]  The problem is you have to get yourself there.
[3375.66 --> 3378.38]  But like legitimately, you'd probably save money
[3378.38 --> 3381.34]  by just renting out a theater every time you want to watch something.
[3381.40 --> 3384.10]  This is like the conversation that we had a little while ago
[3384.10 --> 3389.98]  about how my wife and I actually considered buying the,
[3389.98 --> 3394.74]  the waterfront property right next door to my parents' cabin.
[3395.04 --> 3395.14]  Yeah.
[3395.54 --> 3399.06]  And you guys, you guys saw that property in the,
[3399.14 --> 3402.66]  in the long range wifi video that we did quite recently.
[3403.40 --> 3405.38]  It's beautiful.
[3406.28 --> 3406.76]  Okay.
[3406.78 --> 3408.08]  There's a reason that it's cheap.
[3408.14 --> 3410.38]  To be clear, my parents are not mega ballers.
[3410.46 --> 3412.14]  They're both lifetime teachers.
[3412.14 --> 3414.52]  Like they don't make it, they don't make a ton of money.
[3414.82 --> 3417.14]  They've done well on their real estate investments.
[3417.14 --> 3419.74]  Like pretty much every baby boomer did here in Vancouver.
[3419.90 --> 3421.84]  But other than that, they're, they're not,
[3421.96 --> 3423.26]  they're not crazy loaded or anything.
[3423.26 --> 3424.82]  Don't, don't get me wrong.
[3425.06 --> 3429.38]  We grew up very humbly with five kids on two teacher salaries.
[3429.38 --> 3431.52]  That's not a ton extra to go around.
[3431.68 --> 3431.72]  No.
[3433.58 --> 3436.22]  So, so, but they do have that waterfront property.
[3436.30 --> 3439.20]  The reason that it was affordable is because it's completely off grid
[3439.20 --> 3441.18]  and inaccessible.
[3441.18 --> 3443.08]  There is no, there's no bridge.
[3443.30 --> 3444.04]  There's no ferry.
[3444.16 --> 3447.42]  Even you have to have your own boat and you have to have your own mooring
[3447.42 --> 3448.32]  in order to get over there.
[3448.40 --> 3451.28]  Now they did manage to find reasonable mooring and that's how they're making
[3451.28 --> 3451.68]  it work.
[3451.82 --> 3455.36]  But when Yvonne and I were considering buying the place next to it,
[3455.60 --> 3458.18]  we, we added up all the numbers, right?
[3458.28 --> 3462.30]  Cost of property, cost of building something, cost of, well,
[3462.42 --> 3464.54]  building something like we would want to go to.
[3464.66 --> 3468.22]  So we would need, you know, great internet connections.
[3468.22 --> 3471.92]  So similar to the beam setup that we have across the water for my parents,
[3472.02 --> 3475.36]  but we'd want to set it up somewhere where we can get like really ball in
[3475.36 --> 3475.88]  service.
[3478.04 --> 3482.26]  We'd want to have some kind of like, you know, maintenance.
[3482.38 --> 3483.52]  We wouldn't want to maintain it.
[3483.58 --> 3484.64]  So we're looking at it going, yeah,
[3484.68 --> 3488.32]  we'd have to probably pay for this thing to be maintained on a very regular
[3488.32 --> 3490.18]  or at least somewhat regular basis.
[3490.18 --> 3495.98]  We added up what it would cost in terms of just property taxes over the years
[3495.98 --> 3498.84]  that we would own it, mooring fees over the years that we would own it.
[3498.88 --> 3502.40]  Just all the things, cost, cost, cost, cost, cost, cost,
[3502.44 --> 3508.44]  all the costs that we would have to incur in order to own it for 25 years was
[3508.44 --> 3509.08]  what we added up.
[3509.14 --> 3511.30]  And we went, we looked at that number and we went,
[3512.92 --> 3514.26]  we could basically,
[3514.26 --> 3518.86]  we had just come back from the super nice Airbnb in Grand Forks that had
[3518.86 --> 3519.42]  everything.
[3519.88 --> 3522.50]  It had a fantastic theater room.
[3522.62 --> 3525.04]  It had every tabletop game you can imagine.
[3525.22 --> 3527.60]  Foosball pool, like full size pool table,
[3527.72 --> 3529.78]  freaking enormous surface.
[3530.14 --> 3532.24]  It had like horseshoes in the backyard.
[3532.42 --> 3537.68]  They had ATVs that you could just borrow and go rip around in just as included in
[3537.68 --> 3538.20]  your Airbnb.
[3538.20 --> 3539.14]  And it was like,
[3539.50 --> 3541.02]  I forget how much it was a night,
[3541.08 --> 3543.18]  but it was super reasonable.
[3543.18 --> 3545.74]  It was like staying at a decent hotel in Vancouver.
[3545.98 --> 3547.50]  And we were looking at that going,
[3548.60 --> 3551.88]  how many of those vacations could we go on?
[3551.94 --> 3554.74]  And the answer was literally hundreds.
[3554.96 --> 3562.94]  Like we could spend two to three months a year on Airbnbs and still be out ahead.
[3563.04 --> 3564.24]  And so we're thinking realistically,
[3564.24 --> 3567.70]  how often are we going to be at this vacation property?
[3567.82 --> 3569.32]  Now, if you want to run it as an Airbnb,
[3569.74 --> 3571.34]  that's one thing.
[3571.34 --> 3578.46]  But an Airbnb that is on the other side of a body of water that you don't have easy access to,
[3578.50 --> 3580.86]  you'd end up ferrying people back and forth from it.
[3580.92 --> 3581.80]  I have a job.
[3582.36 --> 3583.90]  I don't need another job.
[3584.56 --> 3585.64]  That's your solution, dude.
[3586.32 --> 3587.16]  What's my solution?
[3587.30 --> 3587.88]  You nailed it.
[3587.88 --> 3590.10]  Just a super premium,
[3590.10 --> 3592.88]  like one theater,
[3593.28 --> 3593.66]  theater.
[3594.80 --> 3596.32]  A one theater,
[3596.88 --> 3597.36]  theater?
[3597.56 --> 3598.08]  Sorry, what?
[3598.18 --> 3598.86]  So what I mean by that,
[3598.92 --> 3599.12]  you know,
[3599.14 --> 3600.56]  you know how like Colossus,
[3601.26 --> 3603.26]  like you call the building a theater,
[3603.48 --> 3605.66]  but then there's like a million theaters inside the theater.
[3605.88 --> 3607.72]  You are actually a genius.
[3607.72 --> 3610.14]  Instead of like 40 screens,
[3610.34 --> 3614.24]  you just have one and you just make it like amazing.
[3614.82 --> 3617.64]  And then like on the launch of the new Avengers,
[3618.04 --> 3620.70]  we're fighting all the gods this time version.
[3620.90 --> 3623.02]  The tickets are just like baller,
[3623.14 --> 3626.74]  but like it's just the best experience.
[3627.00 --> 3628.96]  That is actually an amazing idea.
[3629.44 --> 3630.02]  Because you were,
[3630.06 --> 3630.98]  you were just saying like,
[3631.14 --> 3631.42]  okay,
[3631.42 --> 3633.18]  it can make sense if we make it an Airbnb.
[3633.18 --> 3633.68]  Well,
[3633.76 --> 3634.72]  there you do it.
[3635.00 --> 3636.80]  You have the theater whenever the heck you want.
[3638.24 --> 3640.90]  And then you do showings for other people.
[3642.18 --> 3644.94]  And people can just like rent it for the day.
[3645.34 --> 3645.66]  Sure.
[3645.82 --> 3646.44]  Hang out,
[3646.90 --> 3647.66]  watch movies,
[3647.86 --> 3648.80]  play video games.
[3650.52 --> 3652.44]  You might be a genius.
[3653.98 --> 3654.58]  I mean,
[3654.64 --> 3655.02]  to be clear,
[3655.10 --> 3656.18]  I already thought you were a genius.
[3656.34 --> 3657.06]  I already thought you were a genius.
[3657.18 --> 3659.62]  I've never been given any reason not to believe you're a genius.
[3660.10 --> 3661.76]  I think you've probably been given a few.
[3663.18 --> 3667.36]  A gimmick in the float plane chat says the theater two blocks from my house,
[3667.50 --> 3667.80]  small town,
[3667.90 --> 3669.14]  California is one screen.
[3669.22 --> 3670.12]  And it's actually awesome.
[3671.28 --> 3671.86]  Rod's like,
[3671.96 --> 3672.56]  where do I book?
[3672.76 --> 3673.88]  Cause that would be amazing.
[3674.20 --> 3674.56]  Honestly,
[3674.68 --> 3676.08]  going to the theater is not that great.
[3676.34 --> 3679.22]  I would rather watch a movie on my 77 inch OLED at home.
[3679.30 --> 3680.10]  And quite frankly,
[3680.22 --> 3685.48]  you don't have to go that high end to get a better movie watching experience at home than you would at the theater.
[3685.94 --> 3689.30]  Like Vizio has super affordable,
[3689.86 --> 3693.16]  gigantic freaking TVs that would give you no reason to sit down.
[3693.18 --> 3698.40]  And look at the dimly lit screen and deal with other people making noise or having their phones out or whatever else.
[3698.40 --> 3702.80]  I'm totally a watch a movie in private kind of person.
[3703.58 --> 3705.86]  And so doing this,
[3706.10 --> 3706.30]  right?
[3706.64 --> 3707.86]  So having it be this,
[3707.96 --> 3709.28]  this Airbnb where the,
[3709.28 --> 3711.76]  the screen is one of these direct view,
[3711.76 --> 3712.58]  LED screens.
[3712.58 --> 3714.92]  Like it's balling AF.
[3715.60 --> 3720.36]  I could totally see people just spending a thousand dollars.
[3720.36 --> 3722.14]  And you have like a wicked sound system.
[3722.14 --> 3722.38]  Yeah.
[3722.38 --> 3729.10]  Like a thousand dollars a night for whether it's like a stag party or like graduation party.
[3729.10 --> 3732.68]  I could see people renting it just every night.
[3732.68 --> 3733.68]  Uh,
[3734.00 --> 3734.42]  Oh yeah.
[3734.56 --> 3735.90]  Blue modes talking about swim.
[3735.90 --> 3736.26]  You know,
[3736.26 --> 3737.72]  about people renting out their pools,
[3737.82 --> 3738.04]  right?
[3739.10 --> 3740.16]  I've heard about that.
[3740.28 --> 3740.60]  Yes.
[3741.00 --> 3743.24]  So that's already totally a thing.
[3743.30 --> 3743.76]  This is,
[3743.90 --> 3744.74]  this is amazing.
[3745.20 --> 3745.44]  Uh,
[3745.44 --> 3746.14]  Sierra says,
[3746.22 --> 3748.96]  this is such a galaxy brain idea.
[3750.42 --> 3750.82]  100%.
[3750.82 --> 3752.50]  And you could just,
[3752.66 --> 3752.98]  I mean,
[3753.34 --> 3756.26]  you could even do it relatively affordably,
[3756.70 --> 3757.34]  right?
[3757.44 --> 3757.82]  So you,
[3757.90 --> 3759.62]  you blow a bunch of money on the display,
[3759.76 --> 3760.32]  a hundred percent,
[3760.32 --> 3764.54]  but you can get really good sound for not that much.
[3764.54 --> 3768.64]  If you have a ton of channels and you're in a relatively,
[3768.64 --> 3770.24]  relatively small room,
[3770.24 --> 3773.70]  because I don't imagine that you would have a hundred people in there.
[3773.82 --> 3776.32]  I'm imagining a more intimate experience.
[3776.32 --> 3778.86]  And instead of like movie seats,
[3778.86 --> 3779.82]  like theater seats,
[3779.82 --> 3782.08]  you've got like multiple,
[3782.08 --> 3783.06]  um,
[3783.26 --> 3783.50]  crap.
[3783.58 --> 3785.32]  What are the ones called that have the sectionals?
[3785.42 --> 3787.88]  Like you've got sectionals and bean bags.
[3787.88 --> 3789.20]  And at the back,
[3789.22 --> 3792.16]  you've got like an area where the lights can be on and you've got like some
[3792.16 --> 3795.72]  tables where people can sit and eat and drink and play board games or
[3795.72 --> 3795.98]  whatever,
[3796.12 --> 3797.36]  whatever else you just have like this,
[3797.48 --> 3798.28]  this setup.
[3798.56 --> 3799.36]  Oh man.
[3800.40 --> 3800.84]  Yep.
[3801.04 --> 3801.32]  If you,
[3801.40 --> 3804.52]  especially if you had like kind of almost,
[3804.52 --> 3805.76]  I feel like a,
[3805.76 --> 3808.20]  a still sort of a form of lobby,
[3808.38 --> 3809.56]  but like a place that has,
[3809.82 --> 3810.12]  tables,
[3810.22 --> 3811.98]  maybe tall tables that you stand at or something.
[3812.20 --> 3814.24]  I think it would be used for a lot of,
[3814.24 --> 3814.98]  um,
[3815.02 --> 3815.30]  like,
[3815.52 --> 3819.18]  like film pre-screenings and showings and stuff like that too.
[3819.52 --> 3819.74]  Yeah.
[3821.74 --> 3822.22]  Um,
[3822.22 --> 3824.20]  so,
[3824.20 --> 3824.68]  uh,
[3824.68 --> 3825.84]  is no good.
[3825.96 --> 3829.04]  63 says a friend started a similar service with two rooms,
[3829.16 --> 3830.12]  max eight people,
[3830.22 --> 3832.44]  bring your own booze and catered food,
[3832.44 --> 3833.42]  uh,
[3833.48 --> 3834.38]  and booked that way,
[3834.38 --> 3836.86]  but ran out of funds TX to the big C.
[3836.92 --> 3838.22]  I don't know what that means.
[3838.38 --> 3839.32]  TX to the,
[3839.68 --> 3839.90]  Oh,
[3839.96 --> 3840.96]  thanks to the big C.
[3841.02 --> 3841.64]  Thanks to COVID.
[3842.06 --> 3842.50]  Okay.
[3842.50 --> 3843.36]  There you go.
[3844.54 --> 3845.18]  All right.
[3845.30 --> 3845.82]  All right.
[3846.28 --> 3846.82]  All right.
[3847.24 --> 3847.64]  Yeah.
[3847.80 --> 3848.12]  I,
[3848.24 --> 3848.52]  uh,
[3848.56 --> 3848.80]  yeah,
[3848.80 --> 3850.46]  I think that's a pretty cool idea.
[3850.92 --> 3851.28]  Anyway,
[3851.46 --> 3852.18]  long story short,
[3852.30 --> 3852.56]  good thing.
[3852.56 --> 3855.02]  I didn't buy a Samsung the wall because now there's more options.
[3855.22 --> 3856.76]  Now competition is coming.
[3856.94 --> 3858.14]  Maybe the prices will come down.
[3858.18 --> 3858.94]  We'll see how it goes.
[3859.34 --> 3859.76]  Now,
[3859.80 --> 3861.74]  something that I never addressed on the WAN show,
[3861.80 --> 3864.16]  and this is mostly talking to our float plane peeps,
[3864.16 --> 3868.26]  is that we have removed early access from float plane.
[3868.42 --> 3870.62]  It is no longer a selling point.
[3870.72 --> 3874.36]  I have removed references to it from our page over on float plane,
[3874.50 --> 3875.22]  but,
[3875.70 --> 3876.18]  um,
[3876.28 --> 3877.76]  and we didn't,
[3877.84 --> 3879.96]  we didn't communicate well about it.
[3880.36 --> 3880.80]  Um,
[3881.12 --> 3883.38]  some people are not upset at all.
[3883.56 --> 3883.92]  Uh,
[3883.92 --> 3888.02]  some people were pretty upset and I just wanted to take some time here to apologize.
[3888.62 --> 3889.10]  We,
[3889.40 --> 3892.70]  we've been behind for like six months.
[3892.70 --> 3893.38]  It hasn't been one,
[3893.46 --> 3894.50]  one week early access,
[3894.62 --> 3895.78]  probably over six months.
[3896.14 --> 3898.52]  And we just haven't been able to get caught up.
[3898.60 --> 3901.50]  We've been short staffed or we've been behind for other reasons.
[3901.92 --> 3903.12]  And it's been very,
[3903.24 --> 3903.48]  very,
[3903.48 --> 3904.24]  very challenging.
[3904.38 --> 3905.90]  We have so many channels that we're running.
[3906.78 --> 3907.14]  Um,
[3907.22 --> 3909.84]  and we have not communicated well about the change.
[3909.84 --> 3911.78]  And now we're kind of coming out of nowhere and saying,
[3911.86 --> 3912.00]  okay,
[3912.06 --> 3912.20]  yeah,
[3912.22 --> 3912.60]  forget it.
[3912.60 --> 3913.80]  We're never going to get caught up.
[3913.92 --> 3914.16]  Um,
[3914.16 --> 3915.62]  that was not the right way to handle it.
[3915.62 --> 3916.46]  So I just wanted to say,
[3916.46 --> 3917.00]  to say,
[3917.10 --> 3917.66]  sorry guys.
[3917.98 --> 3922.40]  And we are committing to making sure that you guys are getting exclusives and behind the scenes.
[3922.86 --> 3923.26]  Um,
[3923.54 --> 3927.12]  Madison is responsible for making sure you guys get at least one exclusive a week.
[3927.24 --> 3930.94]  So this week she pranked me putting a bunch of crap in my office.
[3931.04 --> 3931.68]  Thank you very much,
[3931.78 --> 3932.04]  Madison.
[3932.88 --> 3933.34]  Um,
[3933.34 --> 3935.64]  we also are putting cutting room floor footage.
[3935.64 --> 3936.56]  So in the last,
[3937.16 --> 3937.44]  uh,
[3937.44 --> 3939.16]  in the last week or so,
[3939.26 --> 3942.54]  we've gotten some outtakes from the beaming internet across the ocean,
[3942.54 --> 3943.80]  behind the scenes,
[3944.04 --> 3945.20]  Madison pranking me.
[3945.48 --> 3946.32]  We've got,
[3946.76 --> 3947.28]  um,
[3947.68 --> 3949.48]  a little experiment that we were running,
[3949.82 --> 3950.10]  uh,
[3950.16 --> 3953.56]  trying HDR on the bioluminescent gaming PC.
[3953.56 --> 3960.72]  So we're going to do an HDR grade that float plane members will be able to download and watch if they have an HDR capable device.
[3960.84 --> 3961.20]  We don't have,
[3961.24 --> 3962.86]  our player is not HDR capable yet,
[3962.96 --> 3965.38]  but we can just put a file for download.
[3965.56 --> 3970.40]  So that's something that we're going to try and do once in a while when we have a video that really merits it.
[3970.40 --> 3972.60]  So we're trying to find ways to make it up to you guys,
[3972.72 --> 3972.92]  but,
[3973.34 --> 3973.54]  you know,
[3973.60 --> 3977.66]  thank you very much for your support and sorry that we didn't handle it better,
[3977.78 --> 3978.14]  but we're,
[3978.18 --> 3979.40]  we're still going to try and make it,
[3979.52 --> 3980.38]  make it right to you,
[3980.48 --> 3981.22]  right by you guys.
[3982.18 --> 3982.58]  Um,
[3982.64 --> 3984.36]  other WAN show agenda items.
[3985.42 --> 3986.10]  I mean,
[3986.62 --> 3986.92]  man,
[3986.94 --> 3987.36]  I guess,
[3987.56 --> 3987.84]  boy,
[3987.90 --> 3988.86]  we are already over time.
[3989.20 --> 3989.76]  Holy smokes.
[3989.92 --> 3991.64]  Is there anything else that we said that we would cover?
[3991.72 --> 3991.92]  Oh,
[3992.28 --> 3992.54]  oh,
[3992.54 --> 3995.64]  we didn't talk about LTT store.com LTT store.com.
[3995.64 --> 3996.68]  We now have,
[3997.24 --> 3997.34]  da,
[3997.42 --> 3997.52]  da,
[3997.56 --> 3997.74]  da,
[3997.74 --> 3997.94]  da,
[3997.94 --> 3998.44]  da,
[3998.44 --> 4000.38]  mystery water bottle.
[4000.40 --> 4003.10]  What water bottle is it?
[4003.18 --> 4003.98]  I don't know.
[4004.06 --> 4004.78]  It's a mystery.
[4005.40 --> 4009.10]  They are $10 cheaper than our regular 21 ounce bottles.
[4009.40 --> 4011.98]  And the only difference is that you,
[4012.42 --> 4012.86]  um,
[4012.92 --> 4017.46]  don't pay $10 and you don't get to pick your color because long story short,
[4017.60 --> 4023.74]  we are clearing out our gen one 21 ounce water bottles and we were bringing in a gen two bottle.
[4024.82 --> 4027.58]  Don't hesitate to order a gen one bottle though.
[4027.66 --> 4029.44]  The only difference is going to be the graphic.
[4029.44 --> 4030.24]  Uh,
[4030.24 --> 4033.34]  it's not going to have a big Linus tech tips down the side.
[4033.46 --> 4035.44]  So if you actually like that,
[4035.56 --> 4037.36]  then now's the time to freaking order.
[4037.68 --> 4037.92]  Uh,
[4037.92 --> 4041.26]  it's going to be a more up to date motherboard graphic printed on it.
[4041.34 --> 4048.38]  And there's going to be a small LTT logo on kind of where the CMOS battery is on the graphic and they will come with the new lids.
[4048.38 --> 4050.04]  So that's the main difference.
[4050.24 --> 4057.54]  So it is still cheaper to get a mystery 21 ounce and a lid because they are $5 off when you buy them with a water bottle.
[4057.54 --> 4059.20]  So that is the way to go.
[4059.30 --> 4062.10]  If you guys want to get one of these while they last.
[4063.42 --> 4064.30]  Can't kill it yet.
[4064.62 --> 4065.18]  Headphones.
[4067.02 --> 4067.54]  Oh,
[4068.12 --> 4068.78]  I am.
[4068.86 --> 4070.18]  Everyone's been asking about headphones.
[4070.18 --> 4071.74]  I am trying them out.
[4071.90 --> 4072.42]  I,
[4072.74 --> 4076.72]  a mass drop sent over their HD eight X X.
[4076.92 --> 4082.58]  So these are a mass drop tuned version of the legendary Sennheiser HD eight hundreds.
[4083.16 --> 4085.92]  I don't have a proper amp hooked up yet.
[4086.14 --> 4088.02]  I have a Magni two behind me.
[4088.08 --> 4090.80]  Apparently we don't have any headphone amps at the office.
[4090.90 --> 4092.08]  I checked with the logistics guys.
[4092.14 --> 4092.38]  They're like,
[4092.44 --> 4092.56]  no,
[4092.62 --> 4093.32]  everything's deployed.
[4093.44 --> 4093.68]  I'm like,
[4093.76 --> 4093.96]  Oh,
[4094.60 --> 4094.84]  well,
[4094.98 --> 4095.50]  okay then.
[4095.50 --> 4095.98]  So I,
[4096.12 --> 4097.26]  I'll either have to order something.
[4097.36 --> 4098.68]  If you guys have any recommendations,
[4098.68 --> 4099.58]  uh,
[4099.58 --> 4101.06]  maybe drop them in the float plane chat.
[4101.14 --> 4102.46]  The other chats move too fast.
[4103.00 --> 4103.40]  Uh,
[4103.40 --> 4105.36]  so go ahead and drop them in the float plane chat.
[4106.04 --> 4106.34]  Oh,
[4106.82 --> 4107.42]  laddie asks,
[4107.54 --> 4109.86]  is it intentional that you can't get a lid discount with it?
[4109.92 --> 4110.10]  No,
[4110.18 --> 4111.34]  that is not intentional.
[4111.76 --> 4112.04]  Uh,
[4112.04 --> 4113.98]  let me send Nick a quick message and I will,
[4114.06 --> 4115.24]  we will get that fixed for you.
[4115.64 --> 4116.12]  Please live.
[4116.38 --> 4118.88]  That's a mystery water bottle.
[4119.72 --> 4120.12]  Uh,
[4120.14 --> 4120.42]  all right.
[4120.52 --> 4121.98]  We'll get that fixed for you guys.
[4123.20 --> 4123.74]  And sorry,
[4123.78 --> 4124.26]  what were you going to say,
[4124.28 --> 4124.42]  Luke?
[4125.10 --> 4126.48]  I think that might be my department.
[4127.04 --> 4127.38]  Oh,
[4127.40 --> 4127.86]  is it really?
[4128.50 --> 4128.86]  Oh,
[4129.04 --> 4129.38]  uh,
[4129.58 --> 4129.82]  well,
[4129.82 --> 4131.66]  I didn't know the water bottle was coming.
[4132.40 --> 4135.52]  So mad boy zero zero one says,
[4135.64 --> 4139.30]  Holy the quality of the video is so much better than on YouTube.
[4139.42 --> 4139.74]  Good job,
[4139.82 --> 4139.96]  Luke.
[4140.02 --> 4140.20]  Hey,
[4141.04 --> 4141.74]  Luke didn't do it.
[4141.74 --> 4145.20]  Luke did manage the team that does it though.
[4145.46 --> 4148.04]  So big shout out to the float plane crew.
[4148.28 --> 4149.70]  Thank you so much guys.
[4150.96 --> 4151.58]  Negev says,
[4151.66 --> 4154.18]  how do you tune legendary headphones and not make it worse?
[4154.18 --> 4158.10]  So my understanding is the extent of it is,
[4158.10 --> 4159.02]  um,
[4159.02 --> 4162.28]  pretty much adjusting like the look and the length of the,
[4162.28 --> 4164.82]  of the headphone cable or something like that.
[4165.06 --> 4165.60]  Hold on.
[4166.06 --> 4167.56]  I really hope this is announced already.
[4167.90 --> 4168.02]  Oh,
[4168.02 --> 4168.20]  good.
[4168.24 --> 4168.52]  It is.
[4168.60 --> 4169.62]  This is an active drop.
[4169.78 --> 4169.96]  Woo.
[4170.22 --> 4171.08]  That was close.
[4171.58 --> 4171.74]  Uh,
[4171.74 --> 4172.14]  why is my,
[4172.14 --> 4172.52]  and it's,
[4172.52 --> 4173.38]  it's nice when,
[4173.38 --> 4176.06]  when the developers watch the WAN show.
[4177.60 --> 4178.58]  Cause then I can be like,
[4178.64 --> 4179.38]  that's on our end.
[4179.48 --> 4181.36]  And then I just see it post in live chat.
[4181.44 --> 4182.42]  I'm working on it.
[4182.48 --> 4182.76]  It's like,
[4182.82 --> 4183.06]  Hey,
[4183.06 --> 4185.22]  there you go.
[4185.22 --> 4186.86]  Uh,
[4187.56 --> 4191.96]  adjusted driver damping to create mid range balance and reveal treble details.
[4192.12 --> 4195.48]  So basically D Sennheiser veiling if I them.
[4196.60 --> 4198.56]  So that's pretty much it.
[4198.64 --> 4200.04]  Signature drop color accents.
[4200.18 --> 4204.22]  And I think the cable might actually just be the same.
[4204.52 --> 4205.02]  Here's the,
[4205.10 --> 4206.08]  here's the page for it.
[4206.48 --> 4206.74]  Uh,
[4206.74 --> 4208.64]  I am trying them out so far.
[4209.36 --> 4210.38]  Pretty sweet.
[4210.68 --> 4212.08]  Sub base extends to one Hertz.
[4212.26 --> 4212.42]  Uh,
[4212.42 --> 4212.62]  yeah,
[4212.64 --> 4214.18]  there's a reason that they're legendary.
[4214.18 --> 4216.24]  I think they look absolutely awesome.
[4216.36 --> 4220.08]  I don't really understand the signature drop midnight blue accents.
[4220.22 --> 4222.40]  Does anything about these look blue to you,
[4222.46 --> 4222.62]  Luke?
[4224.26 --> 4224.62]  Uh,
[4224.74 --> 4225.14]  no,
[4225.26 --> 4225.90]  not even slightly.
[4226.56 --> 4226.96]  Yeah.
[4227.04 --> 4227.32]  I mean,
[4227.34 --> 4227.76]  I don't know.
[4227.82 --> 4228.40]  Maybe it's blue.
[4228.48 --> 4229.64]  If you look at it real,
[4229.76 --> 4229.94]  real,
[4230.06 --> 4230.70]  real close,
[4230.70 --> 4231.82]  but,
[4231.96 --> 4232.40]  um,
[4232.94 --> 4235.12]  very comfortable for an extended period of time.
[4235.16 --> 4235.32]  I mean,
[4235.32 --> 4236.72]  that really is one of the biggest measures.
[4236.76 --> 4244.16]  It's one of the reasons that I have stuck with my HD 600s for so long was I've had a hard time finding anything that's even close to them in terms of comfort.
[4244.18 --> 4247.38]  I would say this is a little less comfortable for me so far,
[4247.46 --> 4252.66]  but I also haven't given the foam any time to break in and contour to my,
[4252.72 --> 4253.40]  my skull.
[4253.64 --> 4257.64]  So I'm going to give it a little bit more time before I decide that it's not as comfortable.
[4257.64 --> 4263.76]  I think that's pretty much it for the show for today.
[4263.76 --> 4266.12]  Other than just going through some super chats.
[4266.84 --> 4267.94]  What do we got here?
[4268.10 --> 4268.46]  It isn't,
[4268.46 --> 4269.44]  it isn't our department.
[4270.10 --> 4270.38]  Yeah.
[4271.52 --> 4271.96]  Victory.
[4272.64 --> 4272.88]  Oh,
[4272.98 --> 4273.94]  Jonathan Paz says,
[4273.94 --> 4275.72]  you should talk about your investment in framework.
[4275.86 --> 4277.66]  A lot of us in the WEN show chat have asked about it.
[4277.68 --> 4279.30]  And even though your awesome video came out recently,
[4279.30 --> 4280.88]  many here might not have seen it,
[4280.92 --> 4282.16]  or you might have other thoughts to share.
[4282.62 --> 4282.86]  Um,
[4282.86 --> 4283.46]  so far,
[4283.46 --> 4287.82]  I really don't have anything else to add to that video other than,
[4288.10 --> 4288.22]  boy,
[4288.28 --> 4291.02]  am I ever jazzed for that backpack to come out.
[4291.14 --> 4291.32]  Luke,
[4291.74 --> 4293.74]  have you seen the backpack?
[4294.34 --> 4296.64]  Other than in that video?
[4296.74 --> 4296.92]  No,
[4297.30 --> 4298.58]  that's the only place.
[4298.80 --> 4300.00]  Anyone has seen it.
[4300.00 --> 4300.48]  Um,
[4300.48 --> 4302.26]  I have seen it up close.
[4302.36 --> 4303.88]  That is sample number three.
[4304.02 --> 4304.26]  Now,
[4304.44 --> 4305.06]  uh,
[4305.06 --> 4305.72]  we have been,
[4305.94 --> 4306.28]  we have,
[4306.48 --> 4308.66]  why did you guys go for rigid structure?
[4309.56 --> 4310.42]  Why did we?
[4310.78 --> 4311.26]  Yeah.
[4311.34 --> 4311.54]  Sorry.
[4311.76 --> 4315.24]  We went for rigid because we wanted it to have,
[4315.24 --> 4316.10]  um,
[4316.92 --> 4317.08]  okay.
[4317.14 --> 4317.82]  There are a couple of things.
[4318.04 --> 4318.44]  Number one,
[4318.54 --> 4319.06]  there's a reason.
[4319.22 --> 4319.48]  So I'm just,
[4319.60 --> 4322.20]  we wanted it to have a lot of cargo capacity.
[4322.68 --> 4324.40]  So that was one of the reasons.
[4324.40 --> 4327.96]  And number two was comfort was step one.
[4328.48 --> 4329.28]  Comfort was,
[4329.36 --> 4329.98]  was first.
[4330.44 --> 4335.04]  There are so few backpacks that I have ever put on other than like,
[4335.16 --> 4335.50]  you know,
[4335.54 --> 4340.78]  real full blown hiking backpacks that managed to sit right along your back.
[4341.08 --> 4341.86]  You know how they'll,
[4341.96 --> 4346.80]  there'll just be that gap at the top unless you crank it tight and then it'll chafe your neck.
[4347.48 --> 4347.56]  Yeah.
[4347.62 --> 4349.64]  So step one for,
[4349.88 --> 4356.34]  for the design team was no neck chafe and it sits right flush along your back,
[4356.34 --> 4362.44]  following the contour of your spine so that the weight rests on your back and doesn't just pull your shoulders back.
[4363.28 --> 4363.56]  Um,
[4363.64 --> 4363.90]  okay.
[4364.38 --> 4366.92]  We found that the rigid design was better for that.
[4366.92 --> 4369.12]  We like the look of the rigid design.
[4369.20 --> 4373.66]  It's quite a large bag and it is not going to be cheap,
[4373.88 --> 4375.10]  but man,
[4375.18 --> 4377.26]  the build quality is outstanding.
[4377.26 --> 4378.52]  The buckles here,
[4378.80 --> 4379.18]  like these,
[4379.24 --> 4383.76]  these buckles here are aluminum and they're like rugged AF.
[4384.22 --> 4384.56]  Um,
[4384.62 --> 4385.52]  the top strap,
[4385.62 --> 4388.54]  you know how the handle is one of the first things to break on a bag.
[4388.54 --> 4392.60]  So I give you my personal Linus tech tips guarantee.
[4393.48 --> 4397.26]  Your arm will fall off before that handle falls off.
[4397.70 --> 4398.30]  The,
[4398.38 --> 4399.08]  the braided,
[4399.36 --> 4399.50]  the,
[4399.52 --> 4405.00]  the like flat bladed braided strap has three rivets in it on both sides.
[4405.78 --> 4407.38]  It will not come off.
[4407.52 --> 4409.22]  Like every aspect of the,
[4409.26 --> 4409.38]  uh,
[4409.38 --> 4411.00]  the zipper pulls are,
[4411.00 --> 4411.68]  um,
[4411.74 --> 4413.78]  are cast cast metal pulls,
[4413.78 --> 4414.54]  uh,
[4414.54 --> 4416.02]  and they have little carabiners on them.
[4416.08 --> 4417.02]  It's a really cool feature.
[4417.02 --> 4418.24]  So you could take your two zippers,
[4418.38 --> 4419.02]  bring them together,
[4419.42 --> 4420.34]  carabiner them together,
[4420.34 --> 4421.30]  and then they won't come out.
[4421.68 --> 4421.86]  Um,
[4421.86 --> 4424.56]  that's something that I really like when I have something sticking out of my bag.
[4424.64 --> 4427.42]  Sometimes I'll put a racket in my bag and I'll,
[4427.42 --> 4427.70]  uh,
[4427.70 --> 4430.18]  be riding on my motorcycle to badminton or something like that.
[4430.38 --> 4431.90]  So if that comes out,
[4432.22 --> 4433.74]  things can go flying out of my bag.
[4433.88 --> 4434.18]  Uh,
[4434.18 --> 4436.34]  it also is just a theft deterrent,
[4436.44 --> 4439.44]  makes it a little bit harder to open up your bag without you noticing.
[4439.44 --> 4440.28]  If you've got these,
[4440.28 --> 4440.88]  uh,
[4440.88 --> 4441.66]  clasped things,
[4442.20 --> 4442.62]  um,
[4442.92 --> 4443.54]  there's a,
[4443.68 --> 4444.54]  there's a number,
[4445.12 --> 4445.36]  there's,
[4445.38 --> 4446.78]  there's a number of features.
[4447.02 --> 4448.66]  That are just really cool,
[4448.76 --> 4449.36]  really thoughtful.
[4449.78 --> 4450.04]  Uh,
[4450.04 --> 4450.98]  it's going to be,
[4451.08 --> 4457.28]  it's going to be somewhere between probably 175 to 200 us dollars though.
[4457.66 --> 4459.08]  It is not going to be cheap,
[4459.38 --> 4461.00]  but I will.
[4461.00 --> 4462.66]  I think that's kind of in line for,
[4462.66 --> 4465.18]  for like more premium feature full backpacks.
[4465.34 --> 4468.16]  I will confidently tell you guys that at $200,
[4468.48 --> 4469.70]  you're going to be really happy with it.
[4469.74 --> 4470.14]  So I'm,
[4470.20 --> 4470.46]  I'm,
[4470.64 --> 4471.38]  I'm pretty excited.
[4472.24 --> 4472.68]  Um,
[4472.90 --> 4474.30]  Jamie for Tato says,
[4474.36 --> 4475.68]  I'm building a PC for my girlfriend,
[4475.68 --> 4476.34]  uh,
[4476.34 --> 4479.62]  rise in 2400 G 1660 super is a B450 board.
[4479.68 --> 4480.16]  Good for this.
[4480.22 --> 4480.36]  Yeah,
[4480.36 --> 4480.74]  absolutely.
[4481.80 --> 4481.98]  Yeah.
[4482.18 --> 4482.44]  Yeah.
[4482.46 --> 4483.54]  No reason not to,
[4483.54 --> 4484.30]  uh,
[4484.30 --> 4486.32]  I will probably hand down my 3600 X later.
[4486.32 --> 4486.92]  I'm still,
[4487.04 --> 4489.96]  I'm still perfectly happy with B450 for that build.
[4490.08 --> 4490.22]  Yep.
[4491.96 --> 4492.32]  Uh,
[4492.50 --> 4493.12]  Gasty says,
[4493.20 --> 4497.52]  Apple CPUs often don't have big performance gains without smaller transistors.
[4497.70 --> 4500.24]  A8 was barely better than A7 to the point that the,
[4500.38 --> 4500.96]  uh,
[4501.02 --> 4503.38]  5S and 6 stopped receiving updates at the same time.
[4503.38 --> 4504.18]  Uh,
[4504.18 --> 4508.46]  that may not be why Apple decided to do that.
[4508.94 --> 4509.36]  Um,
[4509.84 --> 4511.28]  and they have,
[4511.60 --> 4512.14]  hmm,
[4513.36 --> 4513.74]  ah,
[4513.88 --> 4514.34]  Apple.
[4514.54 --> 4514.92]  Okay.
[4515.34 --> 4519.04]  It's hard to say they don't have big performance gains without smaller transistors
[4519.04 --> 4525.94]  because Apple usually does do a full redesign with a die shrink or excuse me,
[4525.94 --> 4526.20]  uh,
[4526.20 --> 4527.56]  with a process node shrink.
[4527.78 --> 4528.72]  So they,
[4528.78 --> 4532.18]  they don't have a tick tock cadence like Intel had for all those years.
[4532.18 --> 4533.66]  So you don't,
[4533.72 --> 4535.68]  you don't really ever have one without the other.
[4536.68 --> 4537.06]  Um,
[4537.38 --> 4537.74]  so it's,
[4537.74 --> 4539.58]  it's kind of hard to make a statement like that.
[4539.66 --> 4540.74]  I can see what you mean,
[4541.06 --> 4543.02]  but it's,
[4543.10 --> 4545.60]  I don't quite think that it's,
[4545.60 --> 4546.30]  uh,
[4546.34 --> 4546.76]  accurate.
[4547.66 --> 4548.06]  Uh,
[4548.06 --> 4548.70]  Trevor says,
[4548.80 --> 4551.24]  thanks for the warm Lambo hat walking around Juneau,
[4551.32 --> 4552.08]  Alaska.
[4552.22 --> 4553.00]  Don't feel cold at all.
[4553.06 --> 4553.16]  Hey,
[4553.22 --> 4553.58]  heck yeah.
[4553.66 --> 4554.12]  Love it.
[4554.74 --> 4555.36]  Love it,
[4555.36 --> 4556.32]  man.
[4556.46 --> 4557.56]  I think this off season,
[4557.56 --> 4558.46]  I'm going to paint my bike.
[4558.76 --> 4559.82]  Now that I've decided,
[4560.00 --> 4560.04]  I,
[4560.16 --> 4560.28]  you know,
[4560.28 --> 4562.44]  remember I was going to blow a bunch of money on a,
[4562.50 --> 4562.68]  uh,
[4562.68 --> 4563.68]  on an electric motorcycle.
[4564.18 --> 4565.38]  And ultimately I just,
[4565.44 --> 4567.76]  I put another grand or something into my bike,
[4567.84 --> 4568.52]  got it all.
[4568.66 --> 4569.44]  It got new chain,
[4569.54 --> 4571.26]  got everything tuned up.
[4571.70 --> 4572.02]  Um,
[4572.02 --> 4573.06]  I think what I'm going to do,
[4573.12 --> 4577.70]  my winter project is going to be learning how to disassemble it to the point where I can paint it.
[4577.70 --> 4582.06]  And then I'm going to get Ed to lend me or probably operate for me.
[4582.10 --> 4582.86]  I'll get him to help me.
[4583.14 --> 4584.02]  He likes painting stuff,
[4584.08 --> 4586.12]  but he has like a really nice sprayer.
[4586.16 --> 4586.72]  Did you know that?
[4587.24 --> 4587.46]  No,
[4587.52 --> 4588.00]  that's cool.
[4588.08 --> 4588.16]  Yeah,
[4588.20 --> 4588.40]  he does.
[4588.40 --> 4591.66]  He has like a really nice automotive grade sprayer.
[4591.94 --> 4593.24]  He knows a ton about the paint.
[4593.34 --> 4593.72]  So I'll,
[4593.96 --> 4598.14]  maybe I'll hang out with Ed for a weekend and I want to do it like candy pink,
[4598.86 --> 4599.78]  maybe with some,
[4599.90 --> 4600.56]  with some,
[4600.56 --> 4600.90]  uh,
[4600.90 --> 4601.50]  some flex,
[4601.64 --> 4605.36]  like some metallic flex and put some green racing stripes on it.
[4605.42 --> 4606.66]  If I can't have a Lambo car,
[4606.66 --> 4608.64]  then I'm going to go Lambo bike.
[4608.70 --> 4609.90]  That's my plan for this winter.
[4610.32 --> 4611.08]  That's awesome.
[4611.42 --> 4613.68]  Mal asks any update on the G9 review?
[4613.78 --> 4616.60]  The HDR issue mainly affects systems with NVIDIA GPUs.
[4616.62 --> 4618.34]  There's a huge subreddit discussing it.
[4618.44 --> 4618.56]  Uh,
[4618.56 --> 4618.88]  yes,
[4618.90 --> 4620.16]  I have added it to our Trello,
[4620.34 --> 4626.10]  but the issue is that I want to get our hands on a retail monitor and it hasn't launched in Canada yet.
[4626.10 --> 4627.34]  So it's going to be a little while.
[4628.14 --> 4629.60]  Kyle says,
[4629.68 --> 4630.02]  hear me out.
[4630.08 --> 4637.42]  Apple's intentionally not upgrading their port and wants to transition their users to induction charging and transferring files through iCloud so that they can just remove it.
[4637.48 --> 4637.60]  Yeah,
[4637.66 --> 4640.00]  that's almost definitely where they're going with that.
[4640.08 --> 4640.50]  Good take.
[4640.74 --> 4641.20]  Good take.
[4642.36 --> 4643.00]  Nicholas says,
[4643.08 --> 4645.26]  your taskbar isn't hiding because of teams notifications.
[4645.42 --> 4647.20]  You have to click teams to clear the notification.
[4647.48 --> 4648.16]  That could be,
[4648.24 --> 4649.08]  that could be it.
[4649.48 --> 4649.74]  Uh,
[4649.74 --> 4650.64]  I thought you meant,
[4651.26 --> 4651.86]  um,
[4652.16 --> 4654.34]  notifications in the bottom right there.
[4654.34 --> 4655.18]  So that,
[4655.18 --> 4656.94]  that could actually be at bloody teams.
[4656.94 --> 4659.60]  Can teams just stop making my life worse?
[4660.22 --> 4660.82]  How about that?
[4660.90 --> 4661.56]  What do you think of that?
[4662.70 --> 4662.86]  I,
[4663.22 --> 4663.56]  yeah.
[4664.08 --> 4665.12]  Ruchab Shah.
[4665.74 --> 4666.90]  I'm a float plane sub,
[4666.98 --> 4670.32]  but I can't live without continue video playback from where I left off.
[4670.46 --> 4671.48]  I'm not expecting it,
[4671.52 --> 4672.44]  but it would be nice to have.
[4672.52 --> 4673.98]  Is that something we're capable of doing?
[4674.48 --> 4675.84]  We've talked about it in the past.
[4675.84 --> 4677.46]  I do think we're capable of doing it.
[4677.46 --> 4677.86]  Um,
[4678.48 --> 4682.44]  I don't think it's going to like shoot to the front of the queue,
[4682.44 --> 4683.28]  um,
[4683.64 --> 4685.42]  but it would be something we would like to do.
[4685.56 --> 4685.70]  Yeah.
[4686.34 --> 4687.70]  Madison Rowlings asks,
[4687.88 --> 4691.44]  comments about Lewis Rossman's video about your framework investment,
[4691.70 --> 4693.74]  specifically his comments at 10 20.
[4694.46 --> 4695.24]  Oh boy.
[4695.30 --> 4695.42]  Yeah.
[4695.42 --> 4696.78]  Some people were suggesting that you,
[4696.92 --> 4698.30]  you watch it on the stream.
[4698.30 --> 4699.10]  Um,
[4699.70 --> 4701.72]  I mean,
[4702.04 --> 4706.84]  maybe this is more of an after party thing for us to check out.
[4707.08 --> 4707.24]  Maybe.
[4707.46 --> 4709.34]  That might make a little bit,
[4709.42 --> 4709.74]  uh,
[4709.74 --> 4711.56]  that might make a little bit more sense.
[4713.24 --> 4713.68]  Um,
[4714.20 --> 4715.04]  yeah.
[4715.08 --> 4715.74]  Why don't we,
[4715.96 --> 4716.24]  I mean,
[4716.28 --> 4716.50]  ah,
[4716.54 --> 4718.12]  it's the super chats now,
[4718.14 --> 4718.46]  I guess.
[4718.52 --> 4718.66]  Yeah.
[4718.66 --> 4718.92]  We might,
[4719.00 --> 4720.00]  we better just look at it.
[4720.00 --> 4720.22]  Right.
[4720.54 --> 4722.04]  So specifically at 10 20.
[4722.14 --> 4722.58]  So guys,
[4722.68 --> 4724.12]  this is without context.
[4724.12 --> 4725.88]  I haven't watched the whole video,
[4725.88 --> 4730.54]  but let's go ahead and let's go ahead and have a look together.
[4730.54 --> 4730.94]  Shall we?
[4731.24 --> 4731.80]  Um,
[4731.94 --> 4732.28]  you know,
[4732.38 --> 4732.66]  again,
[4732.78 --> 4737.32]  YouTube channel with 14 million subscribers and he doesn't give a shit.
[4737.44 --> 4738.24]  He's just going to say,
[4738.30 --> 4739.32]  this is what I believe in.
[4739.64 --> 4741.30]  I'm going to invest in what I believe in.
[4741.64 --> 4742.50]  If you don't like that,
[4742.54 --> 4743.50]  you can gargle my balls.
[4743.60 --> 4745.72]  I guess he's not going to say that because he has a PG audience,
[4745.80 --> 4746.56]  but you get the idea.
[4746.68 --> 4748.12]  I respect what he's doing here.
[4748.12 --> 4751.16]  And I think that the real key here is not just this is 200 K,
[4751.26 --> 4755.78]  although his 200 K is most certainly a 200 K more than what,
[4755.88 --> 4756.20]  what I,
[4756.24 --> 4756.74]  what I put in.
[4757.34 --> 4762.14]  What's going to really matter here is when people see what he did that are
[4762.14 --> 4766.20]  billionaires or a hundred millionaires or even 10 millionaires and decide,
[4766.28 --> 4766.66]  you know what?
[4767.02 --> 4767.92]  Here's 5 million.
[4768.26 --> 4768.82]  When they say,
[4768.90 --> 4770.24]  here's 500 million on the table,
[4770.38 --> 4771.74]  here's 200 million on the table,
[4771.74 --> 4775.96]  because I have spoken with people that have a net worth of a billion dollars
[4775.96 --> 4776.28]  before.
[4776.74 --> 4780.80]  And it is not just you or I in the YouTube comment section that believe that
[4780.80 --> 4784.12]  tech companies are trying to exert too much control over our lives.
[4784.12 --> 4789.18]  It is not just people who have net worths in the three to five figures that
[4789.18 --> 4792.92]  believe that tech companies are becoming bullies and that they need to have
[4792.92 --> 4793.76]  their power checked.
[4793.98 --> 4797.92]  It is also people in that 10 million to a hundred million all the way up to the
[4797.92 --> 4802.12]  billion dollar range who believe that they have a little bit too much control.
[4802.28 --> 4804.04]  But even at that level,
[4804.56 --> 4806.14]  they don't know what to do.
[4806.42 --> 4808.10]  They don't know what to put their money into.
[4808.32 --> 4809.74]  They don't know what to invest in,
[4809.74 --> 4811.44]  and they don't know what is a scam.
[4811.70 --> 4814.24]  They are more than happy to throw some money on the table,
[4814.40 --> 4815.96]  but they need that sanity check.
[4816.26 --> 4819.10]  They need to know that they're not putting their money into a scam.
[4819.38 --> 4822.26]  And they need to know that when they're putting their money into something,
[4822.46 --> 4825.48]  that they're not the only one putting their money in.
[4826.20 --> 4826.34]  Yep.
[4827.80 --> 4828.72]  It's a good take.
[4829.28 --> 4829.84]  I mean,
[4829.88 --> 4831.62]  obviously it's a very flattering take.
[4831.88 --> 4832.96]  Thank you very much,
[4833.04 --> 4833.22]  Lewis.
[4833.22 --> 4840.26]  We don't see eye to eye on everything as our regular viewers and Lewis's regular viewers will absolutely know.
[4840.66 --> 4842.74]  We do respect each other a lot.
[4842.86 --> 4848.30]  I think I speak for myself and his words sounds like he has a lot of respect for me as well.
[4848.46 --> 4849.54]  We're both professionals.
[4849.54 --> 4851.70]  And,
[4851.90 --> 4852.22]  you know,
[4852.30 --> 4859.46]  I think that the way that he expanded on it was something that I probably should have talked about in the video,
[4859.62 --> 4868.90]  was that part of the reason for both framework and for me to do this was to show that it's not crazy,
[4869.60 --> 4872.00]  and that we believe that this will work.
[4872.00 --> 4882.06]  And I acknowledged in the video that there is a very real possibility of me just putting that 220 some odd thousand dollars in a fire.
[4882.38 --> 4882.60]  Like,
[4882.66 --> 4884.62]  it's quite possible that I will lose it all.
[4884.72 --> 4886.04]  That's how investments work.
[4886.44 --> 4887.66]  But for me,
[4888.08 --> 4891.24]  I have the benefit of if it works,
[4892.14 --> 4893.16]  I make a bunch of money,
[4893.26 --> 4894.08]  which is great.
[4894.86 --> 4897.20]  But what I'm showing is that I believe in it.
[4897.62 --> 4899.92]  I am willing to put up or shut up.
[4900.22 --> 4901.12]  It's that simple.
[4901.12 --> 4902.78]  I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
[4903.30 --> 4904.16]  I actually,
[4904.58 --> 4906.78]  in my Uber on the way home today,
[4907.12 --> 4910.52]  I got all signed in to all my apps on my framework.
[4910.84 --> 4913.76]  I have officially transitioned to daily driving it.
[4914.18 --> 4915.08]  Shout out to Jake.
[4915.46 --> 4916.70]  Jake set it up for me.
[4916.78 --> 4918.04]  He installed Windows on it for me.
[4918.12 --> 4919.68]  I had meant to do that during the video,
[4919.84 --> 4922.00]  but the shooting schedule is a little tight.
[4922.08 --> 4922.40]  And I was like,
[4922.44 --> 4922.54]  ah,
[4922.54 --> 4923.90]  it doesn't really contribute anything.
[4924.02 --> 4925.26]  I should just build it.
[4925.34 --> 4929.96]  I'll just build it in the video and just talk about the why.
[4929.96 --> 4932.38]  So he put Windows on it for me after.
[4932.50 --> 4932.84]  It's like,
[4933.18 --> 4934.76]  it kills me as a techie
[4934.76 --> 4938.20]  to be too busy to Windows up my own machine.
[4939.00 --> 4939.04]  But,
[4939.72 --> 4940.38]  ah,
[4941.10 --> 4942.32]  it's okay.
[4942.44 --> 4944.30]  At least I have people to help me with it.
[4944.42 --> 4944.76]  So,
[4944.94 --> 4945.32]  you know,
[4945.42 --> 4946.20]  that's good.
[4946.56 --> 4946.84]  You know,
[4946.88 --> 4947.66]  what's been fun though,
[4947.66 --> 4950.52]  is working with Jake on a lot of the new house stuff.
[4951.34 --> 4954.38]  He's been instrumental on getting the actual nitty gritty stuff done,
[4954.46 --> 4956.90]  but we've been able to do a lot of the actual,
[4957.24 --> 4957.54]  you know,
[4957.78 --> 4960.18]  putting in wireless access points and testing things.
[4960.70 --> 4962.18]  We've been able to do a lot of that together.
[4962.30 --> 4962.84]  So it's been,
[4962.92 --> 4963.86]  it's been a lot of fun.
[4963.92 --> 4964.98]  I'm really enjoying that.
[4965.08 --> 4965.94]  But yeah,
[4966.00 --> 4967.12]  thanks for the kind words,
[4967.24 --> 4967.48]  Lewis.
[4967.94 --> 4969.70]  And thank you so much to our community.
[4969.70 --> 4970.10]  Actually,
[4970.10 --> 4971.54]  that is something that I should add,
[4971.60 --> 4974.06]  that I had no way of knowing when I was recording the video.
[4974.06 --> 4977.96]  You guys were pretty split when I pitched it to you in the first place.
[4978.40 --> 4980.22]  But I think that the,
[4980.22 --> 4983.84]  the like dislike ratio kind of says it all here.
[4984.16 --> 4990.80]  99% of you are in it to win it with me when it comes to framework.
[4990.94 --> 4992.40]  I've seen a lot of you saying like,
[4992.50 --> 4992.66]  yeah,
[4992.76 --> 4993.14]  we're,
[4993.84 --> 4995.34]  if I needed a laptop right now,
[4995.38 --> 4996.00]  this would be it.
[4996.00 --> 4998.12]  Or I do need a laptop and this is it.
[4998.12 --> 4999.86]  Or I'm holding out for the Ryzen model,
[4999.94 --> 5000.88]  but I'm ready to go.
[5001.26 --> 5003.40]  Because if we don't support this,
[5003.40 --> 5004.00]  this,
[5004.10 --> 5004.30]  I mean,
[5004.36 --> 5006.22]  I love the comments on Lewis's video.
[5006.32 --> 5006.62]  Actually,
[5006.72 --> 5007.12]  these are,
[5007.26 --> 5009.62]  these are as good as the video itself.
[5011.56 --> 5012.52]  Framework is insane.
[5012.74 --> 5014.40]  You can extract the motherboard of the laptop,
[5014.80 --> 5017.68]  put it onto a cardboard box and it can still work.
[5018.56 --> 5021.30]  That is so cool.
[5021.98 --> 5023.42]  That is super cool.
[5023.52 --> 5024.80]  And I want to live in a future.
[5024.90 --> 5025.06]  I mean,
[5025.66 --> 5026.58]  imagine,
[5026.92 --> 5027.76]  imagine this,
[5028.04 --> 5029.88]  imagine being an engineer,
[5030.04 --> 5030.32]  okay,
[5030.32 --> 5031.94]  for a company like Apple.
[5031.94 --> 5040.20]  And it being your job to design the mechanism that makes it so that machine cannot start up unless the chassis is fully sealed.
[5040.86 --> 5052.94]  Apple spent actual money making sure that that product will not work unless it is in the exact chassis that they shipped it in.
[5052.94 --> 5054.94]  Why?
[5054.94 --> 5055.34]  Why?
[5055.34 --> 5055.42]  Why?
[5056.60 --> 5057.20]  Why?
[5057.44 --> 5057.96]  To what,
[5058.08 --> 5059.20]  to what end?
[5059.62 --> 5060.80]  What is the benefit?
[5062.08 --> 5063.18]  Who cares,
[5063.32 --> 5063.66]  Apple?
[5064.06 --> 5064.90]  Who cares?
[5066.34 --> 5066.74]  I just,
[5066.90 --> 5067.40]  it's,
[5067.50 --> 5068.76]  it's just baffling.
[5069.04 --> 5070.50]  It's just baffling to me.
[5070.50 --> 5072.08]  Um,
[5072.08 --> 5074.06]  yeah,
[5074.30 --> 5075.58]  I don't know.
[5077.20 --> 5077.86]  I don't know.
[5078.54 --> 5079.66]  This is a good take from,
[5079.66 --> 5079.94]  uh,
[5079.94 --> 5081.54]  Arthur over on Lewis's video.
[5081.64 --> 5083.66]  Linus came out and not only said he'd invested,
[5083.80 --> 5085.52]  but then told everyone how much he put in.
[5085.88 --> 5087.26]  He went on to explain why he did it,
[5087.32 --> 5090.30]  why the company needs investment and why he believes in Framework's business model.
[5090.48 --> 5092.06]  And even though he didn't want to,
[5092.10 --> 5094.54]  he stopped reviewing other laptops to avoid any appearance of conflict.
[5094.66 --> 5094.80]  Now,
[5095.00 --> 5096.14]  that part I said,
[5096.20 --> 5096.54]  I hadn't,
[5096.64 --> 5097.72]  I have not committed to.
[5098.00 --> 5099.50]  When I'm excited about something,
[5099.86 --> 5100.98]  I want to talk about it.
[5101.12 --> 5101.88]  So I,
[5101.96 --> 5102.30]  I've,
[5102.52 --> 5107.16]  I'm still undecided as to whether or not I will talk about other laptops in the future.
[5107.42 --> 5108.48]  But he goes on,
[5108.74 --> 5109.52]  make no mistake,
[5109.64 --> 5110.90]  Linus is not being altruistic.
[5111.06 --> 5112.38]  He believes he will make his money back.
[5112.72 --> 5114.22]  I want to believe that.
[5114.28 --> 5114.64]  I do.
[5115.04 --> 5116.58]  I want this to freaking work.
[5116.82 --> 5118.14]  That's what I said in the video.
[5118.30 --> 5121.10]  I want a front row seat.
[5121.50 --> 5123.74]  I want to be rooting for this even harder.
[5123.74 --> 5124.88]  That's what I want.
[5125.04 --> 5126.22]  I want it to win.
[5126.30 --> 5128.98]  I want you guys to know that I want it to win.
[5129.84 --> 5130.36]  Anyway,
[5130.76 --> 5132.66]  an investment has,
[5132.66 --> 5135.66]  has genuinely nothing to do with altruism.
[5135.82 --> 5138.70]  An actual investment has nothing to do with altruism.
[5138.84 --> 5141.24]  What it does have to do with is,
[5141.24 --> 5142.62]  is belief in a,
[5142.62 --> 5143.74]  in a product or an idea.
[5143.94 --> 5144.44]  I mean,
[5144.62 --> 5145.68]  I bought the product.
[5145.92 --> 5147.10]  That was altruistic.
[5147.30 --> 5149.04]  They offered to send me one for nothing.
[5149.16 --> 5149.92]  And I said,
[5150.00 --> 5150.22]  no,
[5150.82 --> 5151.86]  I want to buy it.
[5151.86 --> 5155.74]  I literally preferred to give them my money rather than take their money.
[5156.22 --> 5156.46]  That's,
[5156.46 --> 5158.54]  that's the only altruistic thing.
[5159.04 --> 5164.94]  I genuinely believe that this is something that the entire tech industry should strongly get behind.
[5165.08 --> 5165.24]  Yeah.
[5165.28 --> 5167.42]  If you want a brighter future for technology.
[5167.42 --> 5170.06]  And I know that sounds like really grandiose,
[5170.06 --> 5172.58]  but I actually truly believe that.
[5172.80 --> 5173.26]  Like it's,
[5173.42 --> 5175.94]  I think this is extremely important.
[5176.34 --> 5178.20]  I think this company is extremely important.
[5178.54 --> 5179.66]  I hope it sends a trend.
[5180.08 --> 5182.08]  And I think if I,
[5182.46 --> 5182.90]  this is,
[5182.90 --> 5183.80]  this is the point where like,
[5183.84 --> 5184.62]  I keep on bringing up,
[5184.66 --> 5186.22]  like I won't buy one because I'm too cheap.
[5186.22 --> 5188.06]  And I'm not going to get past that line.
[5188.10 --> 5188.46]  I'm sorry.
[5188.54 --> 5189.10]  I just won't.
[5189.56 --> 5192.70]  But if I bought something that wasn't this at this point in time,
[5192.70 --> 5194.86]  I would be very disappointed in myself.
[5194.86 --> 5197.38]  And that's like a weird thing to even say,
[5197.46 --> 5198.98]  because I'm talking about buying a product,
[5198.98 --> 5201.82]  but in regards to like Linus was saying,
[5201.94 --> 5204.06]  putting my money where my mouth is,
[5204.16 --> 5211.48]  I've been talking about wanting this type of stuff literally since the very beginning of me being into technology.
[5211.48 --> 5214.20]  And it has not really truly existed in this form.
[5214.54 --> 5215.62]  And now it does.
[5215.76 --> 5216.68]  And that's fantastic.
[5217.22 --> 5217.42]  Now,
[5217.54 --> 5217.90]  I mean,
[5217.90 --> 5218.54]  to be clear,
[5218.80 --> 5221.06]  the framework laptop is not perfect for everyone.
[5221.06 --> 5222.86]  And I wouldn't recommend it for everyone.
[5222.86 --> 5228.08]  AMD has the better laptop processor right now for certain uses.
[5228.74 --> 5229.26]  Oh,
[5229.36 --> 5230.62]  one thing that's really cool.
[5230.94 --> 5232.60]  Jake clued me into this.
[5232.72 --> 5237.26]  Even though framework does not have Thunderbolt three support listed on their website,
[5237.50 --> 5239.84]  he plugged in a Thunderbolt three device and it actually worked.
[5241.36 --> 5246.36]  So it has apparently unofficial Thunderbolt support,
[5246.60 --> 5248.46]  which I did not even know.
[5248.72 --> 5249.80]  So I had,
[5249.86 --> 5250.92]  I had held on to,
[5250.92 --> 5253.92]  I still have my XPS 13 two in one,
[5254.00 --> 5255.22]  like loaded up with all my stuff.
[5255.26 --> 5260.72]  And it sits in my office because every once in a while I'll need to make a video or I'll need to do something where I need a Thunderbolt device,
[5260.84 --> 5264.04]  whether it's to run a Thunderbolt capture card or I need 10 gig.
[5264.60 --> 5266.32]  I actually ended up,
[5266.52 --> 5266.68]  no,
[5266.74 --> 5268.02]  we ended up using Jake's MacBook,
[5268.14 --> 5270.72]  but I was going to bring it with me to the,
[5270.80 --> 5271.92]  to the,
[5271.92 --> 5275.00]  the NAS,
[5275.00 --> 5279.86]  the server video that's coming out this weekend that we shot at my house when we were there doing the access points.
[5280.52 --> 5280.92]  So I,
[5281.04 --> 5281.50]  every once in a while,
[5281.56 --> 5283.42]  I just need Thunderbolt for something.
[5283.64 --> 5286.04]  But now that I know that the support is,
[5286.20 --> 5287.92]  if not coming in the future,
[5288.00 --> 5288.36]  officially,
[5288.48 --> 5289.40]  at least unofficial,
[5289.64 --> 5292.80]  that'll probably get me out of most of those situations.
[5292.80 --> 5293.32]  So I'm,
[5293.32 --> 5294.04]  I'm super jazzed.
[5294.04 --> 5295.48]  I can just put the XPS 13,
[5295.58 --> 5296.64]  two in one back in inventory.
[5297.28 --> 5298.32]  Just the AMD thing.
[5298.44 --> 5301.70]  And like them having an AMD offering would be great.
[5301.82 --> 5303.24]  And I like that you're pushing in that direction.
[5303.54 --> 5303.82]  Oh,
[5303.82 --> 5304.58]  I have news.
[5305.34 --> 5305.58]  Oh,
[5306.20 --> 5306.78]  I have news.
[5307.28 --> 5307.58]  So yeah,
[5307.92 --> 5308.78]  the framework laptop,
[5308.88 --> 5310.00]  not perfect for everyone.
[5310.42 --> 5314.98]  So don't feel bad if it's not right for you and you need to get something else like that.
[5315.04 --> 5316.42]  I would want to make sure that's really clear.
[5316.42 --> 5316.92]  I don't,
[5317.02 --> 5319.26]  what I was going to say is I don't think most people are in that category.
[5319.54 --> 5320.46]  It's going to happen.
[5321.26 --> 5322.32]  There's going to be some out there,
[5322.56 --> 5322.78]  but I,
[5322.78 --> 5323.64]  I don't like,
[5324.04 --> 5324.56]  yeah,
[5324.66 --> 5325.80]  I don't think most people are there.
[5325.92 --> 5326.24]  That's all.
[5326.38 --> 5326.52]  Right.
[5326.62 --> 5328.48]  But there's hopefully lots of other,
[5328.48 --> 5329.72]  lots of other things coming,
[5329.84 --> 5333.26]  but I did hear back from AMD since I recorded that video.
[5334.10 --> 5335.00]  So I,
[5335.08 --> 5336.14]  this is not verbatim,
[5336.24 --> 5338.16]  but I heard back from Chris there.
[5340.74 --> 5346.32]  I've seen emails going back and forth regarding framework internally.
[5346.54 --> 5347.80]  So that's good news.
[5350.16 --> 5352.64]  And she'll let me know what else she hears.
[5352.64 --> 5354.64]  So if nothing else,
[5354.64 --> 5356.44]  frameworks on the radar now,
[5356.44 --> 5361.56]  because unless you can get support from AMD in terms of processor allocation,
[5361.56 --> 5362.84]  I mean,
[5363.16 --> 5364.66]  you could work with an OEM.
[5364.76 --> 5366.04]  You could design an AMD laptop.
[5366.04 --> 5367.84]  All you need is one chip.
[5368.08 --> 5368.24]  Yeah,
[5368.28 --> 5368.44]  sure.
[5368.52 --> 5368.74]  Fine.
[5368.80 --> 5369.28]  No problem.
[5369.42 --> 5370.40]  That prototype a laptop.
[5371.26 --> 5375.08]  But if you don't get allocation support from AMD,
[5375.46 --> 5377.10]  no OEM is going to take you seriously.
[5377.22 --> 5378.24]  Nobody's going to build your chip.
[5378.34 --> 5379.34]  Nobody's going to build your,
[5379.42 --> 5386.48]  your design because they're going to know that it's just a waste of time setting up the tooling for it because you're never going to be able to produce in volume.
[5386.48 --> 5389.08]  What else do we have here?
[5389.72 --> 5390.32]  Toby says,
[5390.44 --> 5394.32]  framework succeeding would be a great way to show the average consumer that Apple's model is a fabrication.
[5394.70 --> 5394.84]  Yeah.
[5395.62 --> 5395.90]  Yep.
[5396.28 --> 5396.72]  Absolutely.
[5396.72 --> 5400.30]  All right.
[5400.42 --> 5402.40]  I think that's pretty much,
[5402.40 --> 5404.08]  pretty much it.
[5404.20 --> 5404.34]  Hey,
[5404.40 --> 5404.60]  thanks,
[5404.70 --> 5405.24]  Potato Cannon.
[5407.14 --> 5407.62]  Um,
[5408.04 --> 5410.50]  thank you very much for tuning into the WAN show.
[5410.58 --> 5411.90]  We will see you again next week.
[5412.34 --> 5413.56]  Same bad time,
[5413.80 --> 5415.34]  same bad channel.
[5415.96 --> 5416.40]  Bye.
[5416.88 --> 5417.46]  Go buy a,
[5417.46 --> 5419.36]  go buy a thing on LTT store.
[5419.52 --> 5419.78]  Okay.
[5419.88 --> 5420.92]  I got to make some money here.
[5422.02 --> 5422.20]  Yeah.
[5423.60 --> 5424.36]  All right.
[5424.54 --> 5424.96]  Okay.
[5424.96 --> 5425.58]  Oh,
[5425.78 --> 5426.34]  Nick says,
[5426.44 --> 5426.66]  uh,
[5426.66 --> 5426.80]  yeah,
[5426.82 --> 5427.62]  it's supposed to be working.
[5427.72 --> 5428.78]  So apparently it is your problem,
[5428.86 --> 5429.02]  Luke,
[5429.26 --> 5430.84]  that the $5 discount's not working.
[5432.60 --> 5433.00]  Uh,
[5433.12 --> 5433.46]  no,
[5433.54 --> 5436.20]  I think he's saying it's supposed to be working because he probably fixed it.
[5436.66 --> 5436.92]  Oh,
[5437.16 --> 5438.40]  he says it was already there.
[5439.02 --> 5439.46]  So,
[5439.74 --> 5440.06]  okay.
[5440.20 --> 5441.88]  If someone can make sure that's working.
[5442.02 --> 5443.34]  People need to go buy water bottles.
[5443.94 --> 5445.06]  People need to go buy water bottles.
[5445.06 --> 5445.42]  Okay.
[5445.66 --> 5446.14]  Bye everyone.
[5447.02 --> 5447.42]  Bye.
[5454.96 --> 5463.32]  Bye.
[5463.66 --> 5463.92]  Bye.
[5464.30 --> 5466.40]  Bye.
[5466.88 --> 5467.18]  Bye.
[5467.26 --> 5467.58]  Bye.
[5467.72 --> 5467.78]  Bye.
[5467.82 --> 5468.82]  Bye.
