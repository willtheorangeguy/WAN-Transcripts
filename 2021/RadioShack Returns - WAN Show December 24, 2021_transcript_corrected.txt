[0.00 → 2.24] wait till one of them goes green and then I go right
[6.32 → 11.20] and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[11.20 → 16.88] we're going to be talking about radio shack it's back JK it's crypto now
[18.32 → 26.00] crypto's ruining everything why uh what else we got ah yes the audiophile SSD if you don't own
[26.00 → 34.00] one you do not properly appreciate music, and also you probably are just pretty smart what else we got
[34.64 → 39.28] have you ever seen something on TV, and you've just really wanted to take a big juicy bite of it
[39.28 → 46.08] well now you can lick your screen potentially uh remember when licking the screen was like the mark
[46.08 → 51.36] of sort of not having your act together yeah is that changing all right sure let's see how this
[51.36 → 58.08] goes also uh no one's going to see yes yeah, but it's still sort of happening it's not really news
[58.08 → 62.88] it's like the opposite of news it's there will be no news sorry goodbye news there will be
[62.88 → 76.88] remote news goodbye news hello intro
[86.48 → 90.64] you know what the funniest thing about today so it's brought to you by c sonic Latium and cube holders
[90.64 → 97.12] uh I think is that we intended to start an hour early, and we still managed to start an hour late
[97.12 → 105.44] which is almost exactly about when we normally start yeah so uh good job then consistency yeah uh
[105.44 → 111.12] yes sorry about that we will maybe come back to sorry chat we'll maybe come back to the pre-show
[111.12 → 118.00] discussion about bookmarks versus pinned tabs for now we got to talk radio shack that's right you heard me
[118.00 → 127.52] the one-time tech giant radio shack is back and not just as a half-assed online store nope that's
[127.52 → 135.92] right they're shilling crypto so they're back in the same sense that Stan Lee is back you see that yeah
[135.92 → 141.84] that was awful yeah I mean i, but you know what I shouldn't have even been that surprised because
[141.84 → 149.28] i I saw what was happening basically they're using Stan Lee's account to just like to advertise like
[149.28 → 156.24] every advertise well yeah so i was really shocked because it was to buy this NFT of like
[156.80 → 166.88] a character, and you know I okay one aspect of NFTs okay that I could kind of get behind would be that the
[166.88 → 174.08] item was unique right except that if you can just mint as many NFTs as you want yeah you can make
[174.08 → 178.08] copies and like there's so there's no limit you can literally sell copies like it's not even like it's
[178.08 → 184.96] not even like bitcoin where there's actually a finite amount of it yeah you can actually just mint more
[184.96 → 190.24] copies of if it's like having it's like buying a's like buying a digital print of an artwork right
[190.24 → 196.64] where it just says one out of question mark two out of question mark right because you're not gonna
[196.64 → 200.88] keep printing this as long as it keeps making money baby let's go there's no actual control for how many
[200.88 → 205.76] of them they can make so anyway yeah they they they say it's limited, but they're they're using his
[205.76 → 211.44] account to show some stupid NFT of something and i I looked back through it, I'm going I shouldn't have
[211.44 → 219.60] even been surprised by this because the entire account is just full of you know occasionally you know
[220.64 → 226.72] honouring his memory basically just doing fan service in order to get likes and get people to
[226.72 → 235.68] follow it so that they can just shill absolutely anything and everything, and it is so frustrating
[235.68 → 240.40] does it just slightly have something to do with a superhero that he once had some form of affiliation
[240.40 → 247.92] with shill shill shill press the show go go go so i i I hated it and uh I guess I hate this too so
[247.92 → 256.24] over the weekend the company confirmed a pivot into decentralized finance or defy oh man the name
[256.24 → 261.92] for blockchain-based protocols that allow people to send receive trade lend and borrow funds I've
[261.92 → 268.40] always thought that was just the perfectly edgy name yeah it's its great we're defying the the the
[268.40 → 275.36] the standard quo I like it, I like it, I really like it though the standard duo so
[275.36 → 285.76] the website reads radio shack defy will be sorry, sorry it's just really stupid uh will be the
[288.88 → 296.40] can you read it uh where is it will be the bridge between CEOs who stay standard duo instead of status
[296.40 → 302.24] duo um and control the world's corporations and the world of cryptocurrencies yes that's exactly what we
[302.24 → 310.00] want more corps currencies oh my um, and it is not it doesn't have anything to do with the radio shack
[310.00 → 316.48] that you know and maybe have some love left for but rather by retail e-commerce ventures the company
[316.48 → 323.68] that purchased the rights to the name in 2020. Rev owns many chains that used to define U.S. retail
[323.68 → 331.04] including pier one linen and things and dress barn and the general strategy for rev is to pivot failing
[331.04 → 338.16] retailers from storefronts into e-commerce while getting co-investors to pitch in so yep radio shack
[338.16 → 346.00] swap or whatever the name becomes is going to launch its own token radio yep that because that's what
[346.00 → 355.84] that's the way forward radio rate radio star killed the crypto the big fat cats at the banks yeah
[355.84 → 361.92] yeah um the plan is to distribute 10 billion radio tokens the company hasn't yet shared how or to whom
[361.92 → 367.44] they will be distributed and the uh writer comments on this particular one are from Colin says it's
[367.44 → 372.00] pretty clear that the radio shack brand is now being flogged for every penny it's worth and i for one
[372.00 → 377.12] I'm sad to see it go I would expect Colin to be sad to see it go yeah he's definitely a maker type
[377.12 → 383.12] a creator type and radio shack used to be for those of you who are too young to remember it the place to
[383.12 → 391.60] go get things that now you can basically only get one bay or AliExpress and wait three to 18 weeks for
[391.60 → 398.48] it to actually freaking arrive like you could go there and actually buy a capacitor if you needed it
[398.48 → 402.88] to complete an electronics project or something like that like you could pick up like breadboards
[402.88 → 408.40] and stuff like you could actually do electronics projects without resorting to I'm trying to think
[408.40 → 413.76] if there's anything like that left I mean I remember you can browse in person it's mostly as far as i
[413.76 → 418.88] know it's mostly just like kind of small town shops, but there is a bunch of online stuff like I were well
[419.44 → 425.28] yeah I mean obviously it's not as cool in the same way that there's a McMaster car you know there's
[426.32 → 431.52] there 's's definitely online electronic shops like you can go over to mouser sure fine but
[432.88 → 438.48] okay the browsing and tactile in-person experience where you can look through things and get creative
[438.48 → 443.84] with what you see on the shelf yeah there 's's very little of that these days for sure yeah and i
[443.84 → 449.52] mean i the last time I went into a store that really reminded me of old school radio shack where you
[449.52 → 455.36] just be like uh oh yeah where's the servo aisle, and you'd be like oh yeah it's like one over from the
[455.36 → 462.64] the ham radio like supplies you'd be like oh wow oh that's cool uh was a fries before their demise yeah
[462.64 → 469.52] i I was lucky enough to go see a fries' electronics before they turned to absolute garbage did you
[469.52 → 475.92] never know you never saw I heard about how cool they were like remotely forever but never like man
[475.92 → 483.68] what would I even compare it to it's like you know metal mart yeah yeah yeah okay it's kind of like if
[483.68 → 490.16] something it's kind of like if a metal mart like ran into a Home Depot they just like you know like
[490.16 → 496.56] it had that it had that corporate you know all the brands you've totally already heard of side to it
[496.56 → 501.84] but it also had that you know oh you know pick and pick and choose all these things and go
[501.84 → 509.20] metal mart go assemble it for yourself yeah exactly, exactly just figure it out um yeah it was so
[509.20 → 514.40] disappointing to me to see that fries electronics just couldn't pull it together, and it seems
[514.40 → 519.52] like kind of like NCI it's not that there wasn't some money in selling electronics it's just that
[519.52 → 524.48] they collapsed under their own weight and their own mismanagement I don't have any insider information
[524.48 → 529.92] about what exactly happened to fry kind of the vibe you're getting I'm just extremely
[529.92 → 534.40] disappointed yeah there was an interesting question on the end of here do you have any memorable
[534.40 → 540.88] purchases from radio shack back in the day oh my goodness uh i have to tell you that most of my trips to
[540.88 → 546.88] radio shack were as a kid so I would geek over that I would geek out over that stuff but I mean it was
[546.88 → 555.12] mostly like crappy RC cars and stuff like that like it was just they had the stuff that was
[555.12 → 560.24] not mainstream like toys r us right yeah I don't even know if toys r us actually does it even exist in
[560.24 → 564.96] the states anymore I don't even know it's here in Kato still yeah I think it's out in the states but
[564.96 → 569.84] I'm not sure yeah I can't remember the details there but uh they used to have a lot of RC toys and
[569.84 → 574.24] stuff like that I don't know that they would anymore the main thing I remember was a RC car
[574.24 → 578.32] that my dad bought that's pretty cool yep I mean you would have been pretty young by the time radio
[578.32 → 583.20] shack stopped actually carrying anything meaningfully cool like what was their what was their in-house
[583.20 → 588.80] brand I'm trying to remember like i they had cheap batteries like cheap in-house brand rechargeable
[588.80 → 594.80] batteries when I was kind of getting into high school and finding dependable affordable rechargeable
[594.80 → 599.68] batteries and like sort of the early 2000s was definitely a bit of a challenge and you kind of
[599.68 → 605.20] needed them more than you do today because a lot of devices are so power efficient now yeah and like
[605.20 → 610.56] everything used to run on the just monster amounts of double a and triple a batteries just like you'd
[610.56 → 616.32] have I don't remember what was it game gear my game the game gear takes six yeah, and it would chew
[616.32 → 622.48] through them in like four hours yeah and uh what else did I have that was a hog I mean my power shot a20
[622.48 → 632.24] camera I think that took was it three or four double a batteries' oh man we got to check this thing out
[632.24 → 638.80] here's a review from DP review you know the site's been around for a while look this looked state of
[638.80 → 649.36] the art okay in 2001 heck yeah okay uh hold on we got the a20 plastic compact digital camera okay
[649.36 → 657.12] four double a batteries nickel metal hot metal nickel metal hydride recommended ladies and gentlemen this
[657.12 → 668.72] thing weighed 375 grams almost a pound and was 2.1 megapixels oh man, but it had optical zoom okay i actually
[668.72 → 676.24] paid a lot extra for one like a proper digital camera that had optical zoom instead of just digital
[676.24 → 684.08] zoom and that actually was more than one megapixel okay I got uh oh my gosh what was it called I got this
[684.08 → 689.68] weird thing from my aunt that was like a little like handheld thing, and it was like sub one megapixel
[689.68 → 697.20] zoom uh zoom I think zooms came later i I don't remember it was horrible that was cringe I returned it
[697.20 → 701.92] and then I actually ended up spending a bunch of my own money to get this one that served me very well
[701.92 → 706.40] I still have some of my power shot a20 photos do you remember that that keyboard video I filmed
[707.28 → 713.36] yes that was filmed on a zoom nice yeah it was just one of those like it's like a little rectangular brick
[713.36 → 721.12] Luke's first Luke's first unboxing yeah that's a classic right there speaking of classics oh man
[721.68 → 729.52] what will they think of next we are going to have to do a full audio file pc build yeah something like
[729.52 → 734.40] that that was suggested by the person that posted this thread and honestly he listed a
[734.40 → 738.08] few different components and stuff that could go into it and I actually think it would be really
[738.08 → 744.00] interesting and if you paired that with some like blind testing and then maybe tried like okay
[744.64 → 751.44] maybe they do tell a difference at this point but what parts can we remove to make them like no longer
[751.44 → 755.68] be able to tell the difference like what is actually making the impact etc it'd be very interesting
[755.68 → 763.36] my brain hurts so badly what am I even looking at here uh he's now might actually be the wrong timing
[763.36 → 768.64] for this but if you could bring in some community like people who claim to be audio files and
[768.64 → 775.20] get them to do the blind testing that could be pretty interesting too yeah what will they freaking
[775.20 → 783.36] think of next so um it's 800 without the heat sink it's a NVMe SSD one terabyte um it has an eight
[783.36 → 789.60] layer copper PCB mil spec oh yes, yes sorry I forgot that part very important military audio
[789.60 → 797.12] uh external 5 volt DC power input or internal motherboard input with onboard capacitor filtering
[797.12 → 803.84] gold-plated connectors because that means quality um every m.2 connector is gold-plated
[805.04 → 815.60] every single one that is the spec okay also the 800 for a one terabyte NVMe SSD one does not come
[815.60 → 820.96] with the fancy heat sink how much does the heat sink cost don't actually know it was sold out
[822.72 → 832.24] okay is this a joke though I don't think so honestly okay guys help fact check us here is this a joke
[834.96 → 841.60] I think it's legit I can't possibly because there are two ways that something could be sold out right
[841.60 → 847.04] way number one oh I mean it's custom CNC, so there might have been like two is that they didn't produce
[847.04 → 853.44] it yeah right yeah so there could have been basically none of them yeah uh way number two is
[853.44 → 863.60] that people actually bought it um and i just I don't know jelly d and twitch chat is like have you
[863.60 → 874.32] seen the stuff audio files by this is for real come on guys help me out here nobody has offered any
[874.32 → 882.80] kind of evidence that this is actually fake um all right well my disappointment is immeasurable and my day
[882.80 → 891.44] is completely ruined what have you seen the heat sink too yeah yeah I was looking at it, I mean here's what i
[891.44 → 896.72] here's what I don't here's what I don't really um I don't know there are lots of things I don't
[896.72 → 901.92] understand about this but the biggest thing the biggest thing that I do not understand about the
[901.92 → 911.28] revelation audio SSD here is what are they expecting it to do it just it makes your audio better no but
[911.28 → 918.88] really okay you've got a capacitor on your SSD you're taking an external power from where are
[918.88 → 926.80] you taking this external power from a computer power supply okay well it's going to be subject to
[926.80 → 934.32] the same kinds of I mean okay I don't know maybe not technically all the exact same kinds of
[934.32 → 941.04] challenging conditions that power running through the motherboard might, but it's going to be pretty darn
[941.04 → 947.92] similar it's still inside a computer it doesn't even have shielding on it which is one of my favourite
[947.92 → 956.08] actually useful audiophile snake oil things to cover things with just metal foil essentially which
[956.08 → 961.68] can can do something in an in a situation where there could be a benefit to that which
[961.68 → 969.04] here I just don't see how there could be because there's no analog signalling taking place on an m.2 SSD
[969.84 → 975.92] yeah that's none that's the big problem that's the big problem that's the big problem that's a big problem
[975.92 → 983.28] what's more than that um it just doesn't it can't do anything well it could cause compatibility issues
[983.28 → 989.60] with your motherboard because a lot of them like huge things that go on top of them yeah okay um another
[989.60 → 996.72] problem is that this is a who knows what controller they're even using that apparently didn't
[996.72 → 1003.60] merit mention here uh we got the audiophile grade audio note Kai say capacitors, but they don't
[1003.60 → 1011.28] they don't they don't bother to mention if there's a d-ram cache I don't see one a Chris Christie cc HD 957
[1011.28 → 1020.48] fem to clock oscillator it sounds like have you um have you ever watched that it's this like technical
[1020.48 → 1026.16] walkthrough video of this machine, and it's I think it's like a few minutes long, but the guy just says
[1026.16 → 1030.88] literally nothing that means anything oh I think I know what you're talking about the like the it's just
[1030.88 → 1037.20] techno babble yeah uh, and it looks kind of like uh like a sales presentation or like it looks
[1037.20 → 1041.12] very official it's really well produced, but it's its a joke yeah I know what you're talking about
[1041.12 → 1050.24] yeah when I read stuff like that it, it sounds like I'm reading that script oh boy so I wish them luck
[1050.88 → 1058.16] you should get one I would love to get one, but you know what I don't know exactly why, but we have had
[1058.16 → 1063.12] oh my god there's an amazing typo sorry we have had oh uh so I go to your screen sure
[1064.80 → 1068.16] one in sotik
[1070.24 → 1078.16] oh like the socket it's supposed to be stock oh one in stock okay I don't know why exactly but I've had a
[1078.16 → 1084.32] ton of difficulty getting my hands on any of these audiophile snake oil products uh we probably know dude
[1084.32 → 1090.72] well the thing is we've even tried to buy them as like with like a different name I don't know what
[1090.72 → 1096.64] name we used but i I didn't do it right like we tried to get our hands on the audiophile network switch
[1097.36 → 1103.84] because that that one was hilarious um but every time we've tried to place an order for i I think it's
[1103.84 → 1111.28] this one so it's an eight it's an eight hundred dollar eight port gigabit switch yeah um I mean
[1111.28 → 1119.20] supposedly this is in stock but every time we order this stuff it doesn't arrive are they
[1119.20 → 1124.32] screening it is they just not are they just not shipping to Vancouver Canada just in case we get
[1124.32 → 1129.52] our hands on it my assumption is it would probably be a very good idea if you were in the snake oil
[1129.52 → 1136.16] audio file space to screen all of your orders and make sure it wasn't reviewers yeah I guess I could
[1136.16 → 1141.52] see that I mean it worked out not even just you right like anybody yeah it would be pretty
[1141.52 → 1146.08] concerning but I don't know how they would have I don't know how they would okay I guess they could
[1146.08 → 1151.04] have my address but how could they have other people's addresses people who don't just have their
[1151.04 → 1158.96] their company address on Google Maps or whatever I don't get it anyway we're we're trying we're
[1158.96 → 1163.68] trying if we can get our hands on the audio file SSD we will absolutely we will take that we will
[1163.68 → 1168.00] throw it in a motherboard we are going to listen to so much audio we're going to listen to hotel
[1168.00 → 1172.96] California okay we're going to listen to it so hard we're going to be like we're going to need to
[1172.96 → 1179.60] cleanse our palate and put on a sleep mask we're gonna we're going to have an auditioning experience okay
[1179.60 → 1184.00] oh my god is that something people do I promise I don't know audio palette I don't know about the
[1184.00 → 1191.44] audio palette i I think that we could probably we could probably create enough sort of nonsense
[1191.44 → 1196.72] rituals sensory cleanse yeah we should play the music we should play the music into a wine glass
[1196.72 → 1204.56] and give it a little give it a little smell the aroma you know some ginger between songs
[1205.20 → 1209.52] all right that's enough that's enough attention for this nonsense why don't we talk about the flavourful
[1209.52 → 1214.80] TV oh this is great a Japanese professor has developed a prototype lickable TV screen that
[1214.80 → 1226.88] can imitate food flavours uh the device called taste the TV or TTT uh uses a carousel of 10 flavour canisters
[1226.88 → 1233.36] that spray in combination to create the taste of a particular food the flavour sample then rolls on
[1233.36 → 1241.84] hygienic film sure uh over a flat TV screen for the viewer to try in quotes the goal is to make it
[1241.84 → 1246.00] possible for people to have the experience of something like eating at a restaurant on the other
[1246.00 → 1251.28] side of the world even while staying at home i I think you're going to need more than 10 flavours but
[1251.92 → 1260.40] a commercial version of this version of this product uh would cost about 100 000 yen or 875 I'm assuming U.S.
[1260.40 → 1269.20] dollars to make uh potential applications include distance learning for sommeliers sommeliers sommeliers
[1269.20 → 1274.32] yeah uh and cooks and tasting games and quizzes the tasting games and quizzes sounds a lot more
[1274.32 → 1279.92] interesting to me because I seriously doubt the accuracy of the actual flavours generated by 10 flavour
[1279.92 → 1286.32] canisters now don't be a hater don't be a hater 10 flavour canisters okay I mean the first I'm sure the
[1286.32 → 1292.48] first LCD didn't have a ton of pixels and people would have looked at it going you know oh I'm
[1292.48 → 1297.52] supposed to I'm supposed to have a call with my relatives, and it's going to be like spending time
[1297.52 → 1308.72] with them in the same room ha ha huh I don't know okay there's no so i the game side of it kind of
[1308.72 → 1316.00] interesting um I think there's a pretty big issue with taste for cooks because like as anyone who's
[1316.00 → 1325.36] ever eaten anything before um there's more to it than literally just like spray flavour um there's
[1325.36 → 1332.48] heat there's texture there 's's smell there's all this other stuff right so I don't know it's very
[1332.48 → 1337.84] interesting I mean it's something a lot of people have thought about over the years um, and maybe it's a
[1337.84 → 1344.56] tech that gets I don't wildly better over the next x amount of time sure I don't know but sure I'm not
[1344.56 → 1350.24] holding my breath uh speaking of holding or licking my screen for that matter the one similar thing
[1350.24 → 1358.24] that we've experienced before that we've actually showcased is this uh smell VR thing yeah I forget
[1358.24 → 1365.76] what it's actually called cilia yep so similarly it uses these scent canisters in this
[1365.76 → 1371.76] case to make it so that you can uh have this sensory experience that accompanies your VR adventure so
[1371.76 → 1377.92] you're walking around in the forest, and you've got a know a breeze blows, and it wafts the scent of
[1377.92 → 1386.16] of pine into your nose and while I was being only sort of facetious when I was saying oh well
[1386.16 → 1392.24] just because they've only got 10 flavours now you know just they only had 10 pixels or whatever you
[1392.24 → 1395.60] you know now we've got billions of pixels they'll probably have billions of flip well no there's
[1395.60 → 1401.36] going to be a practical limit to that because it's its like actual substance that you have to spray
[1401.36 → 1407.92] and stuff that you have to reload that you know like i could see something like this existing
[1407.92 → 1414.16] uh commercially right like if you were sure yeah if you went to an arcade you know this arcade
[1414.16 → 1420.00] where everyone has to collectively lick the same screen well yes I understand it like rolls yeah sanitary
[1420.00 → 1428.88] hygienic rolling film um but uh just like this where it was a cool demo but not really
[1428.88 → 1434.40] practical for the real world i I think that's that's what we're looking at here I mean I'm glad that
[1434.40 → 1439.68] people are are are devoting their energy to very worthwhile endeavours sometimes you have to make some
[1439.68 → 1445.36] stuff like yeah exactly like this isn't the only thing this professor and his students have created
[1445.36 → 1451.28] and they have a wide variety of other applications that they want to use this like type of theory on
[1451.28 → 1456.72] yeah this was probably an interesting way for them to get a lot of attention on what they're working on
[1456.72 → 1462.00] which is cool for sure yeah, and you know what I might be totally underestimating the potential
[1462.00 → 1469.76] for this like I mean look at this image look at this image and tell me that this will definitely not be
[1469.76 → 1478.40] an entire genre of live-streaming content in five years reacting to uh chat submitted flavours chat
[1478.40 → 1485.60] submitted flavours yeah so your chat basically like you know they they make something
[1485.60 → 1492.56] they mash it into a thing it creates a digital representation of it, and you've just got your
[1492.56 → 1497.36] you've got your lick thing and anytime you get a hype train going or whatever you gotta donate
[1497.36 → 1503.36] five subs and I'll lick the the booger flavour that someone like literally picked out of
[1503.36 → 1509.60] their nose and put in the thing I mean we're talking oh I just unplugged my headphones I got too
[1509.60 → 1516.64] excited there yeah yeah i the limitless chances tell me that won't be a thing in five years yeah i
[1516.64 → 1523.20] mean it's he can't, it's you can't do it no I can't see I can't because it's only 875 bucks, and we've seen
[1523.20 → 1528.80] what some streamers have spent on their setups in order to make unique content it's absolutely a
[1528.80 → 1533.52] thing a one-time purchase they'll just buy like tens of thousands of dollars worth of Pokémon cards and
[1533.52 → 1539.84] unwrap them yeah like i I don't know how the economics of that work but i I'd be empowered to
[1539.84 → 1545.36] them I suppose yeah so like if you can spend 875 bucks and sure there are some flavour refills, but that's
[1545.36 → 1550.48] I mean if you can, he said a commercial version would cost 875 so if you could do that I'm sure the
[1550.48 → 1561.20] refills are a fraction of that price yeah I don't know content do it buy one Ludwig um battlefield 24
[1561.84 → 1567.76] 20 40 fail I wanted to talk about this because I actually find it genuinely hilarious oh um what now
[1568.72 → 1577.12] it's just trash in battlefield 2042's launch week uh it was already losing to farming simulator 22
[1577.12 → 1583.44] um which I mean I'm not particularly into that but I've heard it is a pretty good game so that's cool
[1583.44 → 1591.76] um last week uh multiple 24 hour peaks were like way sub 20 000 um like one of them was like I think it
[1591.76 → 1597.60] was around 15 000 players it's brushing up to the amount of players that are playing actively right now
[1597.60 → 1601.52] battlefield 5 which is the previous game that people did not like
[1601.52 → 1610.16] um it's its already going on sale for 34 off which is a terrible sing for any multiplayer game
[1610.16 → 1616.40] yeah um, and it has a free weekend coming on steam but don't bother because it's terrible um cod and
[1616.40 → 1621.44] halo both absolutely ate its lunch but honestly I think that would have happened even if cod and halo
[1621.44 → 1626.16] weren't I mean I haven't played cod but I've heard it raises the question of why would you all launch like
[1626.96 → 1630.88] right at the same time they keep doing this they always do it's like yeah no there's only there's
[1630.88 → 1637.52] only one month yeah in which you can launch a game a fps game you must launch in November December
[1637.52 → 1644.48] that's every fps game comes out in like yeah late November all the time is is is the Christmas stocking
[1644.48 → 1648.64] boom like that big is that it well this is and I've ranted that your make-or-break moment
[1648.64 → 1654.72] before this is what like killed titan fall is they kept sandwiching it between battlefield and cod over and
[1654.72 → 1659.04] over again when it just did not have the traction that those games had yeah release it in the summer
[1659.04 → 1662.64] and it'll do well yeah don't release it between those two games but yeah they just keep doing it
[1662.64 → 1670.00] so and halo like halo released their beta early I think in reaction to battlefield being terrible
[1671.20 → 1675.36] right so I think a bunch of people got battlefield were like wow this thing's trash there's game
[1675.36 → 1682.56] breaking bugs all over the place the portal mode is just like also really buggy and not anywhere
[1682.56 → 1686.56] near as good as the original version which people are still playing on like community servers and
[1686.56 → 1692.56] stuff so I might as well just go do that um and then halo comes in and just trounces it so yeah um
[1692.56 → 1698.56] speaking of things being buggy I think merch messages are not working oh is that something we can fix
[1699.12 → 1704.96] um, um yes the cube live disappear yeah the queue will disappear like all these will disappear uh no
[1706.16 → 1711.52] should I just go through we've only got 20 so far should I just I'll just do them manually I'll do them
[1711.52 → 1719.04] manually all right we're doing a short merch message intermission here okay as so you go ahead and do
[1719.04 → 1723.36] your thing but in the meantime I'm going to get through these just in case they disappear Brandon
[1723.36 → 1729.76] says oh take more money from me over 700 for the year go float plane hey thanks Brandon r uh thanks
[1729.76 → 1736.72] Andrew Ng uh Michael says old guy poor vision update thanks for the help I got two dell 32 inch 4k VA
[1736.72 → 1741.44] monitors with a modest curve VA is the difference between night and day thank you so much merry
[1741.44 → 1746.96] Christmas I think I remember replying to that merch message a while back uh they were wondering if IPS
[1746.96 → 1751.68] glow was going to be an issue for them and then i I think I had said that if you're is you're worried
[1751.68 → 1756.80] about it then VA is not going to have that same glow uh anonymous says how comfortable is the CPU pillow i
[1756.80 → 1763.12] want it but like 70 for one without knowing it's a throw pillow it's not really intended to sleep on but
[1763.12 → 1768.72] I've seen a lot of reviews where people claim to be that they sleep on it my cat really likes sleeping
[1768.72 → 1772.88] on it, I can tell you that much I could see that for a cat the reason it's so expensive is just
[1772.88 → 1779.60] because it costs a lot to make not because it's necessarily you know going to be a world-changing
[1779.60 → 1785.44] pillow for your bed I don't it's really not designed as a sleeping pillow yeah no but it is mean we did
[1785.44 → 1789.84] fill it with quality stuffing just because like I thought if it is quite comfortable to like lean on
[1789.84 → 1794.48] the couch yeah but i i I don't know people say they do it so that's all I can really sure yeah
[1794.48 → 1799.68] Neil b we don't uh we don't like to delete the reviews on our site like don't you love that when
[1799.68 → 1805.36] you go on to a site, and it's nothing but five-star reviews on the first party site that you're looking
[1805.36 → 1811.76] at super obvious, and you're just looking at it going to come on it's its possible that these are all
[1811.76 → 1818.88] legitimate reviews i I'm not even I'm not even going to challenge you on that, but you didn't I will I
[1818.88 → 1825.76] will say you were never a courier never screwed up the order and didn't deliver on time like half
[1825.76 → 1831.92] of our negative reviews are just because shipping takes a long time yeah so you're going to tell me
[1831.92 → 1840.40] that never happened not even come on very come on yeah i I will say this just to ward off the
[1840.40 → 1847.68] skeptics uh there are reviews that have been removed um they have been removed because of uh things that
[1847.68 → 1853.92] just should not be on a store like yeah like profanity or whatever else sexualized content
[1853.92 → 1860.08] like whatever else if it's an actual review negative or not it stays up on that note if you've left a
[1860.08 → 1864.16] negative review, and we got it resolved for you if you could go back and update it we'd super like
[1864.16 → 1868.80] appreciate that that would be very cool that'd be that'd be awesome yeah uh Neil b says love the
[1868.80 → 1873.44] indoor hoodie got another you bought another two I hope you know that you bought two um minus with your
[1873.44 → 1879.28] love of alpaca and merino wool will more wool garments be made shirts long sleeves sweaters
[1879.28 → 1886.32] lounge pants uh you can expect more wool probably starting with socks um no time super soon though
[1886.32 → 1892.08] costs are going up like crazy and while we did buy like a year's supply of alpaca wool we will have to
[1892.08 → 1896.64] rebuy it again at some point so we're going to see how that goes Calvin says I really want a float plane
[1896.64 → 1902.88] shirt will that ever happen will that ever happen it's happened in the past yeah I don't know maybe
[1902.88 → 1907.92] maybe john Pierre w says merry Christmas from Europe can we get more Linux content yes we have
[1907.92 → 1916.00] part four of Linux challenge finally coming out um do you know why it took so long no ed just didn't
[1916.00 → 1923.44] realize there was a part four and because I was technically the writer for that project and i almost
[1923.44 → 1932.40] never touched the Trello I didn't like to put the card in the right spot and nice um yeah usually I have
[1932.40 → 1938.40] a helper that just helps me do tedious paperwork for projects that I write and in this case it just sort of
[1939.92 → 1945.44] fell between the cracks and so that video was supposed to be up ages ago it's been done forever
[1945.44 → 1952.56] and I completed the last couple of things the editor needed on I think I want to say Thursday yesterday
[1952.56 → 1957.44] and I submitted all that so we're good to go something that's crazy yeah and not to derail
[1957.44 → 1961.84] us to talk about Linux stuff for an hour again yeah sure but something that's crazy is every time
[1962.40 → 1967.68] it gets to the point where uh I don't know if I can say his name because I don't know how long
[1967.68 → 1973.28] he's been here but every time the editor that's working on this project will message me about different
[1973.28 → 1980.00] things that he might need for the project um I'll, I'll just do a cursory look at like how are those
[1980.00 → 1986.00] things doing now like okay it's its the proton dB page like what are the recent reviews
[1986.00 → 1991.68] because it's like I don't know it's very likely very different and yeah it's just constantly changing
[1991.68 → 1997.92] like I talked about my laptop thing like there's I believe the most recent Linux video, or maybe it's
[1997.92 → 2002.16] the next one coming out I don't remember which one I say I'm daily driving Linux on my laptop because
[2002.16 → 2008.00] it's a better experience it's not, and you're not I'm not any more you want to hear something it was true
[2008.00 → 2013.68] for like a month this is a bit of a spoiler for part four but one of the things that Luke found
[2013.68 → 2022.40] was that even first party titles from valve were not perfect experiences in steam and uh for the
[2022.40 → 2028.24] part of the video where I talk about CS go in particular I say hey we ran into these issues
[2028.24 → 2033.04] but we couldn't reproduce them because now it's working because now it's working get this it's broken
[2033.04 → 2041.04] so I tried to launch CS go yesterday on Manjaro, and it would just I'd get a splash screen
[2041.68 → 2047.84] and it would just close that's that's the problem I was i know so what managed to happen
[2047.84 → 2054.80] is in between you actually doing the challenge where it was broken and then me writing up the actual
[2054.80 → 2060.80] script that we both delivered and it being working and us being like well we can't reproduce this error so
[2060.80 → 2064.96] we're just going to have to tell you we ran into some issues and then me actually getting the screen
[2064.96 → 2073.76] cap because I forgot it is now broken again that's actually so funny oh my goodness it's I need to be
[2073.76 → 2081.36] tickled it's such a constantly changing landscape it's its uh it's cool in some ways i know it's
[2081.36 → 2090.24] just unbelievable though um so I forget where we were going with that oh that's so funny timothy h says
[2090.24 → 2094.88] uh love the channel been watching for two years or so was the reasoning for remodelling a house done
[2094.88 → 2100.64] for content or just getting the house how you want it purely content he didn't actually want a house um
[2102.16 → 2111.04] sorry um you know what the house was a combination of things i I wanted to okay my kids want to not
[2111.04 → 2117.12] share rooms so that was one thing, and we could do that in our current house but then I would have no
[2117.84 → 2124.96] sanctum at all everything would be either a person's room or it would be a shared space and i was
[2124.96 → 2131.68] super wanting to still have like somewhere that I could, you know game stream for example, so there were
[2131.68 → 2138.40] there were practical reasons for upgrading um as for why we chose that particular one it was the only one
[2138.40 → 2143.28] that had no clear downgrades over our current house our current house is amazing it's like
[2143.28 → 2149.76] awesome it's super private the neighbourhood is beautiful it's uh really well-built it was actually
[2149.76 → 2156.56] the showcase home for the neighbourhood um, and it was the one that when the development was complete
[2156.56 → 2162.24] the developer kept for themselves so the actual developer of the neighbourhood yeah always a good
[2162.24 → 2166.80] sign there were two screws everywhere there should have been one nail you know like it was
[2166.80 → 2174.08] it's just it was super well-built and I had already gotten everything exactly the way that I liked it
[2174.08 → 2180.16] so I had run networking to everywhere that needed painstakingly over years run networking in ceiling
[2180.16 → 2187.52] speaker wiring I had run uh like your stuff yeah I had put in air conditioning myself I had put in my
[2187.52 → 2192.72] VR wiring for my lighthouses in the ceiling so I didn't have to have ugly wires running down my walls like
[2192.72 → 2198.16] I had put I had my computer running in that closet with fibre optic cabling running through the walls
[2198.16 → 2203.84] like everything was exactly the way I liked it and I was sitting here going oh man so we move into this
[2203.84 → 2210.08] new place and what it's bigger which is great for everyone except I don't care about that I want my tech
[2210.08 → 2214.80] stuff set up the way that I freaking like it, I spent 10 years getting it the way I like it
[2214.80 → 2222.32] so that's a big part of why the house has been such a project because in order to get it up to spec
[2222.32 → 2228.88] up to what I've already got a lot of work needs to be done, and it's going to be easier to do that when
[2228.88 → 2233.12] there isn't all your stuff there, and you're not trying to actively live in that space exactly so we
[2233.12 → 2237.76] want to do it all in one shot and there were reasons that we needed to open up a bunch of the walls
[2237.76 → 2246.56] anyway so it had uh, uh poly b is the type of piping that it had oh no there was poly b up the butt okay
[2246.56 → 2250.32] everywhere in that house so we were going to be ripping half of the walls and half of the ceilings
[2250.32 → 2257.04] open anyway and I figured well when we're doing that you might as well put in the speaker wiring yeah
[2257.04 → 2261.04] you might as well put in the Ethernet I mean that's definitely the time because that's also not like
[2261.04 → 2267.52] a small cut in the wall it's like it's a pretty big one nope it's costing a fortune, but it's
[2267.52 → 2271.52] costing a lot less to do it now than it would cost to do it five years from now when I go
[2272.56 → 2278.56] darn it i just I wish I did that really wish I did that thing yeah uh I've gone a little overboard
[2278.56 → 2285.52] um to be honest with you like I started out not caring at all about things like um smart blinds
[2285.52 → 2291.20] and curtains I was like I don't care I'm never going to use that but now I'm looking at it going okay
[2291.20 → 2293.68] 20 years from now when it's time to resell this thing
[2293.68 → 2300.80] uh a house manual curtains is going to be like what a house of this class yeah will not be
[2300.80 → 2306.96] competitive with something brand new if it doesn't have wiring to the blinds into the curtains
[2306.96 → 2313.36] and there were some things about the house that were exceptional even today like nowadays the uh the
[2313.36 → 2319.36] window and door opener sensors and stuff all battery even on a brand-new house they don't run wires for it
[2319.36 → 2326.48] but this one because it was built back in the 90s everything in this house is hardwired
[2326.48 → 2331.68] it's actually pretty nice which is pretty safe to swap those batteries no batteries because when you
[2331.68 → 2336.32] I mean even if you only have to swap the battery once every two years when you're talking like pain
[2336.32 → 2344.08] you know every door 20 points of ingress into the house like that's a chore that sucks that means like
[2344.08 → 2349.44] one out of every 40 days like once a month you're going around and replacing some stupid like button
[2349.44 → 2354.64] cell battery and some stupid sensor that might not even be that easy to reach like that sucks yeah
[2354.64 → 2362.48] um so having the opportunity now while the walls and ceilings are open to run power to the probably
[2362.48 → 2367.68] won't even put in smart blinds or curtains at least not everywhere like my bedroom I think it'd be kind of
[2367.68 → 2376.00] nice to have just because i i I do not um I do not regulate my sleep very well I think it's called um
[2376.88 → 2385.44] uh GS uh gamer syndrome no I wasn't going to real with that uh so I don't regulate my sleep very well
[2385.44 → 2391.92] and something that I think could probably help me is to start to control things like the colour temperature
[2391.92 → 2398.08] of the light um brightness uh doing things like opening up the curtains slowly as you're supposed
[2398.08 → 2402.00] to naturally wake up apparently stuff like that helps a lot so I could see myself playing around
[2402.00 → 2407.28] with it a little bit, but honestly it's something that I put in more for resale value trying to be as
[2407.28 → 2413.52] forward-thinking as possible and I realized that the previous owners probably tried to be as forward
[2413.52 → 2418.80] thinking as possible putting in things like the intercom how'd that work out for them
[2418.80 → 2425.20] but I think my way is going to go better because in cases where I don't know if the standards will
[2425.20 → 2430.48] evolve we've put in a lot of conduit yeahs so as long as you've got hey if you've got conduit and a
[2430.48 → 2440.00] string yeah you are ready to go ladies and gentlemen conduit's good uh yeah there will probably be bits
[2440.00 → 2445.04] for the screwdriver available at launch given that the screwdriver is like super super super delayed
[2445.04 → 2448.40] how did we even get on this topic oh right I'm supposed to be going through the
[2448.40 → 2452.80] merch messages that have accumulated they are working now i see that they're working
[2452.80 → 2460.00] I see that they're working uh unfortunately the one thing missing is time stamps whoops uh so I have
[2460.00 → 2468.32] no idea where I left off and oh yeah great oh question for Linus your Lamb had a manual transmission
[2468.80 → 2473.04] oh moved, and you said that's something you really liked about it is that because you find driving a
[2473.04 → 2478.16] manual is more fun or because it's more reliable slash easier cheaper to repair I have done
[2478.16 → 2484.72] almost zero of my own car work I think I brought my car into our high school shop when I did take
[2485.36 → 2490.72] I took shop class did you know that no actually I did wow uh yeah I know right genuinely surprising
[2490.72 → 2497.52] yeah right well i I filled my whole timetable I never took a free blog so I did like technology where
[2497.52 → 2504.48] we built like this RC submarine thing and we I did metal art and jewellery we did stained-glass I like
[2504.48 → 2510.88] made rings and stuff like that i took shop where I learned to change my own oil change breaks
[2510.88 → 2517.04] uh I learned how to do an alignment like kind of basic stuff uh so I took like all these like
[2517.04 → 2522.56] electives and stuff and still managed to do all my sciences uh and I will tell you out of every class
[2522.56 → 2528.08] that I've ever taken in my life shop is the one I remember the least from I think the only thing that
[2528.08 → 2536.32] I learned in shop was my potty mouth that makes sense I'm not going to generalize okay I'm not
[2536.32 → 2542.88] going to generalize about shop people i took a few spares because I was like ahead in years in
[2542.88 → 2549.28] I skipped a year in chemistry I skipped I did I completed all the computers courses that the
[2549.28 → 2555.76] school had when I was still in grade 10. Um I skipped a year in math I did a lot of that stuff and then I took
[2555.76 → 2561.84] I took a fair amount of uh spares because I was working right okay I was working like actually a
[2561.84 → 2565.92] pretty considerable amount in high school that's fair that's fair to gather money for you never
[2565.92 → 2573.04] skipped a grade Luke never skipped a grade how did you have extra blocks then we just had like
[2574.16 → 2577.92] well you don't need to fill all your blocks in order to have enough credits to graduate
[2577.92 → 2582.64] so a lot of people would just take like a study block okay yeah like almost everyone I knew had at
[2582.64 → 2589.36] the least one study block in grade 12. I was like no dog this is free it's free now it costs money later
[2589.36 → 2594.56] I am going for it my school didn't have a lot of like a lot of the things that you just described
[2594.56 → 2600.88] like we didn't have this oh yeah we had super cool electives yeah my computers teacher was awesome
[2600.88 → 2605.44] uh I have three like amazing teachers that were just absolutely fantastic my computer's teacher was one
[2605.44 → 2610.96] of them um he's a principal at a local school that's cool, but he used to be a computer's teacher and he
[2610.96 → 2616.32] like he went to bit over the summer and took a game development course yeah and then like
[2616.32 → 2622.48] recompacted that course into a course for us in school oh that's that he only ran one time because
[2622.48 → 2628.24] like my year was really into it right and that was like awesome so that was like technically an extra
[2628.24 → 2633.12] cool course that we had outside that it was very limited fun fact I never took a computer's course
[2633.12 → 2640.56] really nope I mean it was mostly like programming so it wouldn't have helped no, no not yeah wouldn't
[2640.56 → 2644.56] wouldn't have done anything for me uh so in response to your question I just prefer driving
[2644.56 → 2650.56] manual because it's more fun for me I'm not I'm not judging uh I'm a computer
[2650.56 → 2655.04] engineering student looking to better understand the way GPUs process data and turn it into images
[2655.04 → 2661.68] can you recommend any books or resources oh my god there was this amazing blog that I bookmarked for
[2661.68 → 2668.72] myself like a hundred years ago that was super cool on exactly this topic it was one of those
[2668.72 → 2676.32] things that was it was like way over my head and yet accessible enough that I could like to figure it
[2676.32 → 2682.40] out don't know what it was yeah i wanna i want to find it now I feel like I did send it to you because
[2682.40 → 2687.92] I was probably like holy crap this is everything we ever need to know about GPUs or something like that
[2687.92 → 2694.88] yeah I have vivid memories of this but I don't remember I'm sorry if anyone knows what I'm talking about
[2694.88 → 2702.88] feel free to drop it in the chat unfortunately the keywords GPU and blog are returning a lot of
[2702.88 → 2709.52] results for in my inbox so I'm not going to be able to find this easily at least not quickly so if you
[2709.52 → 2715.04] guys uh if you guys have any great resources for that feel free to drop it in the chat uh thanks
[2715.04 → 2720.00] timothy h whoop where'd that go oh my goodness these are starting people have figured out that there's a
[2720.00 → 2727.12] limited edition product on the store, and they're starting to order it really fast um yeah so we'll
[2727.12 → 2732.24] talk about that in a little bit I think have I made it through all the ones that we needed to get through
[2733.20 → 2737.60] I'm not sure I might just have to come back to them later I think you did let's try and stay on top of
[2737.60 → 2741.52] the ones that are coming in, and we should stay on top of talking about our sponsors for the show
[2741.52 → 2749.68] oh show is brought to you by see sonic but is that going to work yes merry Christmas happy holidays from
[2749.68 → 2754.64] see sonic just kidding they actually didn't pull that move this year they almost always buy like
[2754.64 → 2760.00] special holidays, and they're just like yep merry Christmas from see sonic so I'm going to assume that
[2760.00 → 2765.20] that was their intention today and I'm not going to do a proper read for them oh I'm just going to be like
[2765.20 → 2772.56] see sonic says you know hey have a safe and enjoyable holiday season yeah eat lots of
[2772.56 → 2779.28] food uh spend as much time safely with your family as you can and your friends and uh your loved ones
[2779.28 → 2785.28] who are not family and not friends I can't think of too many loved ones who wouldn't also be in the
[2785.28 → 2792.32] category of family or friends and um you know hey if you're is you're is your holiday season is powered by
[2792.32 → 2797.52] sonic so much the better but uh yeah go check them out at the links below or don't just have
[2797.52 → 2802.48] a wonderful just have a wonderful weekend have a wonderful evening have a wonderful rest of the
[2802.48 → 2808.16] year happy new year's all that good stuff yeah show is also brought to you by ultium designer
[2808.16 → 2814.16] enables engineers to connect with every facet of the electronics design process it's intuitive to use
[2814.16 → 2820.48] you can interact in a 3d environment, and it features interactive routing they've even got Latium 365
[2820.48 → 2825.52] which allows multiple people to work on the same project at once their blog is amazing by the way
[2825.52 → 2832.08] they just have so much useful information speaking of really valuable blogs um they've got a free trial
[2832.08 → 2836.96] of Latium designer viewer today for a limited time, and we're going to have that link down below, so guys go
[2836.96 → 2841.28] check it out if you want to learn about uh electronics design, or you want the tools that you
[2841.28 → 2845.84] need in order to take it to the next level you can go check them out at the link down below the show is
[2845.84 → 2850.08] also brought to you by cube coders amp by cube coders is a self-hosted game server management
[2850.08 → 2855.12] panel that focuses on ease of use and a highly refined user experience it works for both windows
[2855.12 → 2860.40] and Linux based servers and supports dozens of games including Manheim minecraft CS go and more
[2860.40 → 2864.88] it has mobile support for managing servers on the go the ability to schedule backups or other in-game
[2864.88 → 2870.00] tasks and can even automatically manage your firewall if you want it to it's super easy to install with no
[2870.00 → 2874.72] command line knowledge required, and almost all admin tasks can be done via their web interface
[2874.72 → 2879.92] and there are many video tutorials for users that need them in order to figure things out which yeah
[2879.92 → 2884.24] there's no shame in that on Linux it's installed with literally a single command that takes care of
[2884.24 → 2888.40] everything and there are no monthly fees for the standard editions and starts at just 10 bucks as
[2888.40 → 2894.32] a one-time cost with free lifetime updates, and you can learn more at codecuters.com slash amp slash when
[2895.52 → 2902.96] man you know what I'm noticing a bit of a pattern here you notice how games with dedicated servers and
[2902.96 → 2908.96] the ability for there to be community hosted servers have a much longer shelf life than games that rely
[2908.96 → 2917.36] on the game developer to maintain stuff yeah it's like how is it that it ends up being so profitable
[2917.36 → 2922.24] to be the good guy like valve they're just like yeah community servers whatever, and then they just create
[2922.24 → 2927.60] like a facade they just create a community browser experience they I mean the old classic one is still
[2927.60 → 2932.32] there, but they just put they put a sheen over it like a modern gaming sheen no one can tell the
[2932.32 → 2940.00] difference CS go still relevant so many years later, and you can still do yeah you can still do custom
[2940.00 → 2944.40] service, and they can still make money on skins and whatever else the titan fall community and I know i
[2944.40 → 2950.48] know I know but we when we talked about titan fall a fair amount a while ago yeah right around that time
[2950.48 → 2956.16] um unplanned there was this big community push to like to get people to play titan fall again, and it peaked well
[2956.16 → 2964.80] higher than battlefield 24 2 is currently at uh um, but it has been just buried by DDoS for a long time
[2964.80 → 2971.52] now yeah like it's been unplayable for a long time and uh users are trying to take it into their own
[2971.52 → 2979.28] hands and force uh custom dedicated servers for titan fall 2. it's pretty interesting I haven't been
[2979.28 → 2984.00] following it that closely but I've been following it a little bit that'd be super cool it'd be awesome
[2984.00 → 2991.44] yeah and like it's its people want to play so bad like the titan fall 2 Subreddit is huge, and it's its
[2991.44 → 2996.16] just a ton of people very frustrated that they're not allowed to play a game which is such a wild concept
[2996.16 → 3008.16] I know right um but yeah it is what it is all right what else it is is is more topics AMD's 5000 series
[3008.16 → 3015.92] thread ripper pro Chagall specs have apparently leaked here they are ladies and gentlemen posted
[3015.92 → 3024.32] by fake KGB on the forum man okay hold on a second side conversation if someone walked up to you and said
[3025.44 → 3028.24] I'm a fake KGB operative
[3028.24 → 3038.32] what do you believe that they're a KGB operative 100 every time so they're just they're they're
[3038.32 → 3043.76] pulling some next level I'm going to be looking for the gunman gate I'm going to be all full paranoid all
[3043.76 → 3052.32] that kind of stuff all right back to the specs here so we've got some uh what look like very, very raw
[3052.32 → 3057.28] part numbers here we've got some sockets we've got some core counts looks like we're going to get
[3057.28 → 3063.84] everything from 12 cores all the way up to 64 which is same as last gen but I'm still expecting
[3063.84 → 3070.64] markedly better performance uh 32 mega transfer 3200 mega transfer per second memory man why do they
[3070.64 → 3078.24] insist on doing this why does AMD insist on rating all of these this entire lineup of processors at 280
[3079.28 → 3083.44] I knew you were going to say the TDP when you started that sentence because I had the same reaction i
[3083.44 → 3089.92] I wrote that one I had the same reaction as you, I was like wait are you kidding me like i just why
[3090.64 → 3097.92] it's so annoying yeah especially when they got they've actually got all these different
[3097.92 → 3102.96] core clocks that they can end up running at and all these different power draws that they're actually
[3102.96 → 3109.44] expecting the bloody thing to have so why not just say hey this is only uh this is only a hundred and
[3109.44 → 3120.72] seventy watt processor, and then you can just know that you can buy a lighter cooler and for that one
[3120.72 → 3128.88] to run properly it's crazy um unfortunately it looks like this is going to be the end of thread ripper as
[3128.88 → 3133.52] a consumer platform, so there won't be any normal thread ripper there's just going to be thread ripper pro
[3133.52 → 3138.00] this just goes to show you that you either whatever die the hero or live long enough to
[3138.00 → 3144.08] become the villain yeah AMD came in they're like yeah more course for everyone consume everything's
[3144.08 → 3148.96] going to be a consumer platform it's going to be freaking awesome, and then they were like hey you know
[3148.96 → 3153.52] what in addition to regular thread ripper we're going to have like a pro one it's going to have
[3153.52 → 3159.36] it's going to have liked you know EC proper ECC support, and it's going to do this, and it's going to
[3159.36 → 3164.64] do that the same things that we got mad at intel ha ha remember that consumer one see you later buddy
[3164.64 → 3172.40] now we're going to paywall the ECC support on this, and it's going to be perfect for us and don't
[3172.40 → 3179.52] even worry about it all I can hope is that intel yeah they're not but i I would love for intel to bring
[3179.52 → 3187.76] in a heat competitor that's that's scrappy and forces AMD to reevaluate this pro sort of
[3187.76 → 3191.84] workstation only approach to the thread ripper platform because for enthusiasts for thread ripper
[3191.84 → 3197.36] was so cool there were flaws okay there were thought there were flaws thread ripper was limited
[3197.36 → 3204.08] uh to oh man what were we stuck it was either I think it was 256 gigs of memory and on a 64 gigabyte
[3204.08 → 3213.52] processor that is really not enough and so not having proper support for like registered dims or load
[3213.52 → 3220.88] reduced dims was a real bummer and thread ripper yeah probably makes more sense in terms of
[3221.44 → 3228.16] positioning especially now that there's a 16 core regular desktop dozen that once we get ddr5 is
[3228.16 → 3233.52] probably going to be capable of like 128 gigs of ram like now that we have that honestly yeah it's
[3233.52 → 3240.08] probably not that necessary, but it was just AMD being a bro because they were the underdog and then as
[3240.08 → 3244.72] soon as they're not the underdog they're like ah we don't really have to like bro any more we
[3244.72 → 3249.44] realistically we can't make enough processors for how much demand there is anyway so let's just yeah
[3249.44 → 3254.24] let's just not worry about being a bro and I wish that I wish AMD just would continue to be a bro
[3254.24 → 3260.56] here that's that's all I have to that's all I have to say about that oh you're the one that always tells
[3260.56 → 3267.04] me that they won't be because like when AMD first started coming back I was like yeah like the good
[3267.04 → 3272.64] one's getting good again, and you were like well not really it's just good that there's more company
[3272.64 → 3277.36] sorry it's good that there's more competition but like AMD is not your friend no it's that simple
[3277.36 → 3282.32] companies are not your friend intel is not your friend AMD is not your friend uh there are people
[3282.32 → 3289.60] there that could be your friend yeah I know some super cool people at pretty much every major tech
[3289.60 → 3295.44] company I don't personally know anyone at AMD but I know some people and I've trashed on intel a lot and
[3295.44 → 3299.76] I know some people at intel that I'm friends with for sure yeah for sure yeah and people that
[3299.76 → 3304.88] not just you could be friends with but people that actually really care oh yeah like really care about
[3304.88 → 3309.44] the product really care about the enthusiast community and even when intel was in like the
[3309.44 → 3315.28] worst of the dumps there were people that worked there that really cared absolutely it's there 's's
[3315.28 → 3324.88] also a lot of people that work there um Danny v8 asks isn't LTT a company no Linus media group
[3324.88 → 3332.80] incorporated is a company and as a company it has actually an in some cases different objectives and
[3332.80 → 3339.04] a different agenda than I personally do or than Luke personally does its true like leg incorporated's
[3339.04 → 3346.08] only job is to make enough money that it can pay all of its staff including me and so that it can
[3346.08 → 3352.24] reinvest in its own business so it can continue to grow that is like the capitalist definition
[3352.24 → 3357.36] of a company it's its a corporate entity it's its own legal entity it's actually even though I am
[3357.36 → 3365.04] the primary shareholder along with my wife Yvonne um it is it has its own reason for being that is
[3365.04 → 3372.08] separate from us so uh you know I might be super chill but I might disagree with Linus media group
[3372.08 → 3378.72] incorporated entities agenda, and we might have to find a way to reconcile how I feel about a topic versus
[3378.72 → 3383.20] how Linus media group incorporated might feel about a topic so I have to put myself in different shoes
[3383.20 → 3388.64] for example we have a video upcoming that I just recorded prior to the show on the removal of the
[3388.64 → 3398.72] YouTube dislike counter and Linus media group and I were sort of um conflicted over one of the things
[3398.72 → 3405.52] that I wanted to talk about in the video but Linus media group wasn't a big fan of um that's a good way
[3405.52 → 3412.00] saying that so one of the one of the things that uh we address in the video about YouTube's removal of
[3412.00 → 3419.20] the dislike button is how to restore it, so there's a Google Chrome extension actually there are extensions
[3419.20 → 3425.68] for a number of popular browsers that allows you to re that allows you to restore the dislike counter
[3425.68 → 3432.24] to YouTube and the way it works is pretty interesting we get into that but what that doesn't allow you
[3432.24 → 3438.88] to do is restore the dislike counter in a YouTube app on your mobile device you could use a mobile
[3438.88 → 3445.12] browser to browse YouTube but I think that I don't probably have to tell you guys that that's a pretty
[3445.12 → 3451.68] crappy experience um so you could use a browser with the extension installed on your mobile device
[3452.32 → 3459.60] but the way to do it not yet but maybe in the future with an app is with YouTube advanced so
[3459.60 → 3466.56] YouTube advanced is an application that um circumvents some of the ways that Linus media group incorporated
[3466.56 → 3475.04] makes money and that negatively impacts um Linus media group its employees its collaborators and
[3476.24 → 3484.08] you know Linus media group wasn't a big fan of me talking about it but Linus Sebastian the tech
[3484.08 → 3488.96] personality who wants to make you guys as thoroughly informed on this subject as possible
[3489.60 → 3496.32] felt like well any conversation about this is not going to be complete without mentioning this
[3496.32 → 3502.48] potential upcoming collaboration between the return YouTube dislike uh extension and YouTube advanced
[3504.08 → 3510.48] so I'm in this awkward position where either I have to harm my own business
[3510.48 → 3517.60] or I have to harm my own reputation by sending you guys into a rabbit hole where you find something
[3517.60 → 3522.96] ultimately, and you go hey he didn't mention this he must have known about this what's up with that
[3524.72 → 3532.96] so I won um so just like when we did the video on pinhole uh we are we're just going to be like yep
[3532.96 → 3539.44] that's a thing it's a thing that exists and Linus media group can suck it I used to I used to be super super super
[3539.44 → 3543.76] against ads and videos you probably remember that but ultimately at the end of the day it's just
[3543.76 → 3549.20] entirely unsustainable to not have ads and like it is makes sense that that's the standard for everybody
[3549.20 → 3556.00] now, and you just need to do it to survive makes sense so that's uh that that's what we're doing
[3556.00 → 3564.48] that's how we're going with it good little YouTube I've never actually tried it i if is dislike is the
[3564.48 → 3570.96] dislike counter comes to it though i I'd be tempted I'd be tempted so I don't even know if I don't even
[3570.96 → 3577.12] know if there's a way to configure advanced for example to uh to see ads so that you can support
[3577.12 → 3589.60] creators in that way don't know I don't know uh what I could do is this is weird uh I don't even know if
[3589.60 → 3595.76] I like it um, but you could get like YouTube premium and then use advanced I mean yeah you could do that
[3595.76 → 3600.80] i I saw someone on float plane being like I use advanced I subscribe on float plane yeah it's like
[3600.80 → 3605.44] yeah that helps us, but you got to remember there's a lot of yeah there are a lot of other content creators
[3605.44 → 3611.84] out there uh bedim update on the sweatpants is that they are still stuck in the port of
[3611.84 → 3618.40] Vancouver is just meeting containers into a holding area, and then they will open them when they get
[3618.40 → 3626.16] around to it yeah so good luck everybody um hi, hi 217 says I use premium and advanced but hi, hi 217 is a
[3626.16 → 3631.12] twitch viewer, so the credibility is a little low yeah questionable questionable questionable
[3632.32 → 3638.32] everyone's pulling out of CES original article here is from DA developers and I get if it's not
[3638.32 → 3646.16] cancelled yet but man it just really doesn't seem like very good optics to show up at
[3646.16 → 3652.96] here uh T-Mobile's out AMD's out NVIDIA's out I know intel's out, so this article might be a little
[3652.96 → 3657.92] bit older that's sort of a big deal intel almost always has one of the biggest booths at CES right
[3657.92 → 3663.12] when you walk into the main hall uh center hall I think is the one it's been it's been a couple
[3663.12 → 3670.40] of years since I've been yeah I'm liking it i i I'm just so tired of CES I think I would really enjoy
[3670.40 → 3678.48] attending it as just an attendee like if I just could stealthily like you know just walk around
[3678.48 → 3683.76] on the show floor no one knows who I am just kind of look at stuff and just take it in but
[3684.32 → 3689.68] covering it is so exhausting i just I did it for years and I just can't do it anymore yeah
[3691.20 → 3696.80] just can't do it was actually really nice the one year that I did it I went for like float plane and i just
[3696.80 → 3702.64] met with a bunch of creators it was really cool yeah I'd like to go on the show floor to like find
[3702.64 → 3712.24] somebody and as I was cruising by just like oh that looks cool see some cool stuff yeah um so yeah
[3712.24 → 3718.32] see you later CES I mean we'll, we'll still see all these announcements and everything uh just expect to
[3718.32 → 3723.28] see them more digitally the smart brands are the ones that have already reached out to work with
[3723.28 → 3730.00] us like Asus uh sent us some prototype devices that we did a video showing off so that'll go up
[3730.00 → 3736.32] when the embargo would have lifted during the show if there was to be a show in other news intel is
[3736.32 → 3745.04] apparently planning to sell pre-binned core i9 12 900ks that could reach 5.2 gigahertz on all cores
[3745.04 → 3752.64] could this be a response to AMD's dozen with 3dv cache I don't know but the videocards.com article seems to be
[3753.44 → 3758.24] uh speculating that this could be true but then also please note that this post is tagged as
[3758.24 → 3767.92] a rumour does this really need to exist um and if it does why don't they just call it something else
[3770.32 → 3780.72] yeah um I don't think it does in the modern day but I don't know they have called these types of
[3780.72 → 3790.24] things something else in the past haven't they so there was they there was the 9900ks yeah um what
[3790.24 → 3795.52] was the difference with the KS like I thought they've had like an almost like a golden sample system a few
[3795.52 → 3803.76] times so they provided us with some golden samples for a giveaway once they are definitely capable of
[3803.76 → 3812.88] creating them but to my knowledge they've never really done a pre-binned CPU right other than i
[3812.88 → 3821.28] think the KS was like a slightly more booster uh 9900k I'm actually double-checking that
[3821.84 → 3829.04] on arc right now 900k arc because it was five gigahertz all core and then the other one is oh
[3829.04 → 3834.16] basically the same thing did it have a higher base clock or something I can't I have to confess
[3834.16 → 3839.36] I can't even remember the difference yeah it had a higher base clock so it was four gigahertz all core
[3840.16 → 3847.12] so yeah it seems sounds kind of cool um personally I'd rather they just call it something else entirely
[3847.12 → 3855.12] I mean I guess KS is a different name for it but it is really just it confuses the lineup like
[3855.12 → 3861.12] you got to remember the only difference from one alder lake to the other assuming a similar core
[3861.12 → 3869.04] configuration is the clock speed it freaking runs at so if that makes it a different number or this
[3869.04 → 3874.00] different number why are we now changing suffixes i I get very confused here's a weird question do you
[3874.00 → 3880.40] think overclocking is as popular these days as it was before it's certainly easier to do than ever
[3880.40 → 3885.44] before, but it's also less effective than ever before you're not getting a huge benefit from it the way
[3885.44 → 3889.28] that you used to I mean they know their targets a little better in the old days you were able to
[3889.28 → 3895.68] overclock a CPU in some cases to double its original clock speed I mean that's that's insane
[3895.68 → 3900.96] doubling your performance who would spend the extra money, and you've got legendary chips like the Cameron
[3900.96 → 3909.20] 300a that was just dirt cheap and people would just overclock the snot out of those things like
[3909.20 → 3916.40] 450 plus megahertz like that was the golden era of overclocking I mean even by the time I got into
[3916.40 → 3924.96] it overclocking had pretty much seen its heyday like you were not you were not taking your Athlon 2500
[3924.96 → 3934.16] plus Athlon XP 2500 plus and really doing that much to it, I mean p4c Northwood was maybe the last
[3935.12 → 3941.36] really oh no Prescott the thing about Prescott though the thing about those later p4s was that they were
[3941.36 → 3946.72] so non-competitive with AMD from a performance standpoint that even when you overclocked them
[3947.36 → 3952.64] they still didn't make a ton of sense, and they weren't that cheap so it just didn't yeah it didn't
[3952.64 → 3958.00] didn't make a ton of sense to me like there was just no reason to own one in the first place so
[3958.00 → 3965.92] even if you could overclock the bananas out of it why i just I find I rarely hear people talking about
[3965.92 → 3970.96] overclocking these days and yeah I think the biggest part of it is the limited performance
[3970.96 → 3978.80] gains um but I don't know I mean i my system's not overclocked mine isn't either right now
[3978.80 → 3983.60] it's water cooled and not overclocked it's like really stupid I should just be running air cooling
[3983.60 → 3989.76] honestly speaking that was my theory with my previous rig was like i I knew I was like probably
[3989.76 → 3993.60] going to be running it not overclocked for the most part so I was just like whatever might as well go no
[3993.60 → 4000.56] maintenance uh I guess now's as good a time as any to reveal our GPU wasteland collection that's right
[4000.56 → 4008.16] my friends it's a limited edition desk pad and enamel pin created by the one and only Sarah butt
[4008.16 → 4015.92] I did we say how many of them we made uh apparently we do not it's full of all kinds of
[4015.92 → 4022.08] fun little Easter eggs uh let's see if we can bring up the full size image here welcome to scalper city
[4022.08 → 4028.72] sold out bitcoin scalper central got barbed wire everywhere she had a lot of fun doing up these
[4028.72 → 4034.72] graphics maybe too much fun I'm actually not sure if this project made a ton of sense we only
[4034.72 → 4041.92] printed I think a thousand of them but if you order the desk pad you will also get a limited edition pin
[4041.92 → 4047.84] that goes with it so it's just a little enamel pin to remember these times
[4050.48 → 4054.56] how great is that I actually like the pin I think the pin looks pretty I think the pin looks really cool
[4054.56 → 4060.72] I mean there 's's no doubt that the design is great she did a great job uh we've
[4060.72 → 4066.64] got no NFT references you know what NFTs back when she designed this because our deliveries have been
[4066.64 → 4071.36] so freaking we were worried the GPU shortage would be over by the time we got these like it's been
[4071.36 → 4079.12] delayed so many times NFTs hadn't really taken off in the news to the same degree yet so yeah guys get
[4079.12 → 4083.84] them while you can and then people already have been don't get them while you can't there's been a lot of
[4083.84 → 4091.76] burst messages with those the last six merch messages that have come through have all been
[4091.76 → 4101.04] the GPU wasteland desk pad set oh wow okay yeah all right uh in news that could be positive
[4101.04 → 4108.24] um you know regarding GPUs uh video cards has reported on rajah kauri from intel talking about
[4108.24 → 4115.12] their upcoming arc GPUs over a live stream so the hardware is apparently past the beta state
[4115.12 → 4120.24] which means we are that's good closing in on release now ladies and gentlemen uh we've got a
[4120.24 → 4128.08] video coming where we actually show intel's it tells timeline uh for new products it's somewhere in
[4128.08 → 4134.24] the neighbourhood of around three years and once the beta hardware stage is passed like we are things are
[4134.24 → 4140.08] imminent arc alchemist is already sampling to partners who are providing feedback arc GPUs are
[4140.08 → 4145.68] being manufactured at TSMC but silicon shortages are affecting them and the main incentive with this
[4145.68 → 4149.36] launch is to get a foothold in the market which tells us intel is going to be aggressive which is
[4149.36 → 4154.96] great the bigger the installation base the more game developers will pay attention to them um so they are
[4155.60 → 4162.24] saying that they are incentivized to get these into the hands of gamers rather than miners to which I say
[4162.24 → 4167.76] put up or shut up yeah we would be happy to do a big launch event with you guys with the verified
[4167.76 → 4173.76] actual gamer program let's go I'll take as many as you can send I promise they will go to verified
[4173.76 → 4180.64] actual gamers yeah so there you go i have issued my challenge and kauri confirmed that intel
[4180.64 → 4186.40] is developing hardware solutions for blockchain operations, but they will not be GPUs could they be
[4186.40 → 4192.32] similar to NVIDIA CMP cards we don't know the discussion question for this one from Nicholas
[4192.32 → 4198.64] proof is are these cards going to live up to the hype honestly my hype level is pretty low yeah I expect
[4198.64 → 4206.72] them to be a mainstream option that ain't great but is good enough for people to just have something to
[4206.72 → 4213.36] buy which I will argue is what we need right now that's what we need, we just need something that makes
[4213.36 → 4222.56] sense to buy so we don't have freaking like here, here okay let's go to eBay okay what's a GTX 1060 6 gig
[4222.56 → 4230.64] worth it's going to disgust me anywhere from 275 to 350 dollars you can get them as little as 255.
[4231.76 → 4239.28] that is horrible that's absolutely horrible that shouldn't be a thing and any modern graphics card no
[4239.28 → 4245.76] matter how supply constrained should be able to beat that in terms of price to performance so
[4245.76 → 4251.20] that's what i want people to just have anything to build a system because honestly I think
[4251.20 → 4258.00] it's been a hugely detrimental period for the custom pc enthusiast community over the last couple of years
[4258.00 → 4263.84] deeply like yeah it's building a computer sucks people don't want to watch videos about building computers
[4263.84 → 4269.84] I have friends in real life have who have like pivoted their hobbies away from computer hardware
[4269.84 → 4276.48] to other things uh a lot of them have been cars because it's just been such a bad space
[4276.48 → 4281.12] yeah how's cars working out for them uh I mean it's better if you don't actually have to buy a car then
[4281.12 → 4286.56] I guess it's yeah because working on your current car yeah I can see that has actually been okay buying a
[4286.56 → 4291.84] new car yeah not okay, but that's a little working on your current car tinkering with it making it better
[4291.84 → 4297.04] changing out other things have largely been insulated unless you're trying to do electrical
[4297.04 → 4302.72] stuff but a lot of them aren't so right yeah fair enough uh shoot I think I might have accidentally
[4302.72 → 4309.12] lost my tab for the merch message dashboard that's really I've been managing it everything
[4309.12 → 4315.92] on top of it okay that means I can't read them though there's a lot coming in okay but uh yeah well
[4315.92 → 4320.16] I got it covered yeah sorry guys we're not going to be able to address them all today that's just
[4320.16 → 4326.16] the cold hard truth because we we we just can't, I have to get home and like eat dinner with
[4326.16 → 4334.64] my family at some point so let's go ahead and do our last topic here goodbye HDMI 2.1 hello HDMI 2.1
[4335.36 → 4343.12] a now with source-based tone mapping which is actually pretty cool because HDR tone mapping is
[4343.12 → 4348.88] a real big challenge I heard that wrong okay that makes a lot more sense cool so 2.1a will be the active
[4348.88 → 4355.04] certification scheme going forward, but it still won't be on the packaging instead you will see a
[4355.04 → 4363.44] list of optional features so SBT source-based tone mapping is an optional feature that will allow a
[4363.44 → 4367.44] portion of the HDR mapping to be performed by the source rather than the display device which is good
[4367.44 → 4371.84] because a lot of display devices don't handle it very well this could allow for HDR content on one
[4371.84 → 4377.60] screen and SDR content on another at the same time which is super cool that's nice um, but it's going
[4377.60 → 4386.40] to be a confusing absolute gong show to know whether your HDMI 2.1 device supports this or variable
[4386.40 → 4392.08] refresh rate or high bandwidth or whatever else and i I hate it I hate everything about that
[4392.08 → 4400.64] all right let's go through and do a few uh merch messages here oh boy they are coming in really
[4400.64 → 4409.20] fast yep uh Daniel asks any plans for photography centric projects uh products uh probably not as much
[4409.92 → 4415.52] uh oh wait what is happening right now uh if I refresh this page is it going to be oh, oh boy it
[4415.52 → 4419.44] should be fine okay so I can just archive that probably not as much just because it's not
[4419.44 → 4425.92] our it's not our jam as much uh Leonard happy holidays hey thanks you too by the way as pc
[4425.92 → 4431.68] brands are very different in Asia could you expand more about Asian tech and related content I mean we
[4431.68 → 4436.88] try to cover things when we can get our hands on them, but it's not always that easy, and it can be
[4436.88 → 4442.88] very expensive like that transparent TV cost a fortune it was impossible to get took forever to get and it
[4442.88 → 4447.84] was impossible to get rid of i couldn't even I couldn't sell it for like 500 bucks so we gave it away
[4447.84 → 4453.36] at the Christmas party I don't even know if that many people entered to win it I don't even know what
[4453.36 → 4460.16] whoever wanted is planning to do with it like honestly uh check out bangle.js yeah I included that
[4460.16 → 4469.28] just for you yeah really how have I not seen this hackable smartwatch interesting hardware buttons
[4469.28 → 4483.20] huh, huh oh interesting okay bangle.js for 70 British pounds um yeah if someone from there wants to
[4483.20 → 4489.92] wants to reach out and get in touch I'm I'm I'm intrigued I'm very intrigued it's affordable
[4489.92 → 4497.68] I just want a simple I just want simple that's pretty cool okay uh Brandon an asks it went away
[4498.64 → 4506.16] uh is it time to upgrade my and then like I think 15-year-old hardware 2900x is in crossfire I think
[4506.16 → 4510.48] it's probably time just even from like a power efficiency standpoint that's pretty brutal everything's
[4510.48 → 4514.96] so expensive though uh no I wasn't actually planning to watch the launch, but that sounds awesome
[4514.96 → 4523.52] uh Adam b I just bought a 5600x do you think it'd be a good match for my 3060 absolutely yes
[4524.64 → 4529.36] uh Alexander l first time buying merch live on the stream any updates on LTT sandals no updates
[4529.36 → 4536.24] whatsoever on the sandals uh we had an unexpected staff departure um that delayed that project the good
[4536.24 → 4543.52] news is that I think people internally know already so I'll just say it she's coming back yeah it's like
[4543.52 → 4549.52] turns out the pastures were greener here hey working at leg it's not that bad so uh yeah we're
[4549.52 → 4554.16] we're pretty we're pretty excited actually it was way more complicated than that it was not that simple
[4554.16 → 4559.20] uh, but we're we've we've worked it out and I'm extremely excited to be working with her again and
[4559.20 → 4565.60] hopefully we'll be able to get the uh Luke what are you where are you moving this stuff to oh I see
[4565.60 → 4570.56] uh yeah hopefully we'll be able to get sandals rocking again uh we already gave an update on the next
[4570.56 → 4574.88] Linux challenge video coming very soon do you want to see internal right angle USB type c connectors
[4574.88 → 4580.00] become the standard for motherboards as badly as I do not necessarily because the male connector is
[4580.00 → 4584.64] so bulky that you could end up with it interfering with a lot of cases so I don't think that's
[4584.64 → 4590.16] a cut and dried I was going to say I think it really depends on the case oh my goodness they're coming
[4590.16 → 4594.80] in so fast that I can't even click on things properly because it just moves focus on the
[4594.80 → 4600.88] curated okay myself how are your birds doing sorry how your birds doing uh they're doing good
[4600.88 → 4605.04] they were kind of buttholes last night they didn't want to go to sleep that was very annoying but
[4605.04 → 4610.08] overall they're good they're healthy everything's all right healthy buttholes uh Calvin I really want
[4610.08 → 4616.24] to flip oh no I already answered that uh Powell asks how do I clean this it's going to be soaked in
[4616.24 → 4623.52] pizza juices well I see you already bought two of them uh referring to the GPU wasteland desk pad so
[4623.52 → 4629.92] I think you already know the answer I mean i told Sarah about this project I was like look
[4630.96 → 4637.20] it's white we are never doing a mouse pad like this again I'm sorry because what I told her from
[4637.20 → 4643.60] the beginning was that I wasn't that comfortable doing something that would be very stainable because
[4643.60 → 4651.36] an I don't like producing stuff that is going to just wear out and need to be replaced very quickly and b
[4651.92 → 4658.72] from a brand standpoint I don't like seeing people's like set up shots with like our product looking
[4658.72 → 4663.44] ugly and got like coffee stains all over it so I told her I wasn't that comfortable doing it in the
[4663.44 → 4669.92] first place and then when we did it anyway uh I looked at the one that she's had on her desk since she
[4669.92 → 4678.00] got the first samples it is a Degas okay it is debutant it is
[4682.56 → 4690.56] absolutely okay it's its it's awful um it's just it is covered in coffee stains I'm like this
[4690.56 → 4696.48] completely validates everything that I said that I had yes yeah so i I really don't think we're going to do
[4696.48 → 4704.24] another one so it's not recommended, but we've had successful machine washes right uh not, not on a
[4704.24 → 4710.08] white mouse pad like there's just a limit right like on the black ones yeah i I machine wash my
[4710.08 → 4717.60] mouse pad yeah yeah I guess you'd have to be freezing yeah of course yeah uh Ryan c says this is dog
[4717.60 → 4722.88] indoor hoodie uh float plane gods when um wasn't sure what he was referencing to probably for the
[4722.88 → 4726.72] wan show I would think so I included that there are full plane bots yeah i just sometimes
[4726.72 → 4730.16] I'm a little slow putting them up because it doesn't process immediately so I can't do it right
[4730.16 → 4734.56] after the show and then I get distracted with my life and then I don't do it they're supposed to be
[4734.56 → 4740.00] automated now yeah are they I mean if they are then great yeah uh Matt c can you add more APU videos
[4740.00 → 4744.80] since GPUs are dumb right now yeah the problem is what else are we supposed to say right like once we
[4744.80 → 4751.92] say hey an APU makes sense to buy to tide you over what are we contributing by doing another video about
[4751.92 → 4757.60] that that's why it's been so challenging lately like what are we supposed to say there's not
[4757.60 → 4762.40] anything there 's's no new story to tell uh I think that labs is going to really help with this
[4762.40 → 4767.36] I think that as we go through, and we just test stuff just mercilessly test stuff stories are going to
[4767.36 → 4775.36] emerge but I wouldn't be surprised to see at least for a time the Ltd upload schedule get scaled back
[4776.40 → 4780.72] there's not enough to talk about and I think we are I think we're spinning our wheels a little bit
[4780.72 → 4786.56] right now it's its I mean content in the computer hardware space has been kind of tough
[4786.56 → 4793.20] for a long time as hardware releases have been more spread out and more rhythmic and more expected
[4793.20 → 4798.08] performance levels and all that kind of stuff yep, and then you make it so that no one can buy anything
[4798.08 → 4804.56] yeah, and it gets way more difficult I don't pretty boring yeah yeah uh Igor do you have any plans to
[4804.56 → 4808.72] have a cybersecurity job opening in the future would love some cyber content as well as patch notes or
[4808.72 → 4813.28] summary of the week's top news I mean that's the kind of thing that I think makes more sense as a
[4813.28 → 4817.20] much smaller completely separate channel, and it's something that's on our radar, but it's not something
[4817.20 → 4823.52] that we have any imminent plans for uh have you ever thought of making merino wool t-shirts
[4823.52 → 4829.76] slash button shirts instead of just using it for socks asks Simon w uh yeah uh we have but
[4830.64 → 4834.00] we're not in any particular hurry we want to get the socks figured out, and then we're going to go from
[4834.00 → 4838.80] there anonymous will labs delve into keyboard performance tests at all if so I'm very
[4838.80 → 4843.84] interested in an organization such as LTT publishing latency tests for big name keyboards and perhaps
[4843.84 → 4848.96] other custom mechanical keyboards uh yeah that's honestly that's the kind of thing that we'd be
[4848.96 → 4855.28] very interested in covering for sure yeah love the idea um actually i kind of feel like I need to add
[4855.28 → 4860.48] that to the dock real quick and like do you want to do a do you want to do a chat sure yeah uh
[4863.52 → 4868.96] there's a lot specifically addressed to Linus did you guys ever test that one thousand dollar HDMI cable
[4868.96 → 4873.92] from back in the day on the new cable tester I didn't I got rid of that immediately I paid the
[4873.92 → 4880.88] restocking fee and I returned it oh nice good yeah any possible possibility for highlander 2 or lowlander
[4880.88 → 4886.96] we've been trying to get it off the ground for years playing minecraft in a mine yeah
[4889.68 → 4894.48] that's actually pretty good I had not thought about that one I had pitched a submarine at one
[4894.48 → 4901.76] point in time, but minecraft in a mine is pretty fantastic it's just spectacle though there's no
[4902.40 → 4908.32] learning outcome there's no there's no point to it how they get internet down there would be like
[4908.32 → 4914.96] an interesting discussion yeah yeah I guess so I mean run a cable probably is the answer with access
[4914.96 → 4920.72] points along the way like yeah I've always wanted you guys to do a video and I've probably talked to
[4920.72 → 4927.76] you about this a few times about internet in Greenland it's actually fascinating but anyway um is
[4927.76 → 4935.84] the indoor hoodie dryer safe I dried the Ltd beanie, and it turned out looking worn out uh yeah so something
[4935.84 → 4941.84] like this uh you wouldn't want to tumble dry especially if your dryer has any sort of uh um
[4942.40 → 4947.28] you want to hang it anything abrasive or anything that can catch on it uh, but the indoor hoodie would
[4947.28 → 4952.24] be fine to tumble dry yes yeah actually I don't know if I'm contradicting the official care instructions
[4952.24 → 4958.80] though when I say that I think a lot of our stuff is uh is actually marked like hold on
[4958.80 → 4972.32] uh oh we apparently say do not tumble dry so now you know sorry uh but honestly the biggest reason
[4972.32 → 4977.36] for that um i I have tumble dried this one already the biggest reason for that is to cover our butts
[4977.92 → 4982.80] because uh tumble drying it's like we can't control what kind of dryer you have what kind of heat
[4982.80 → 4989.12] settings you're on so we can't control if you're going to destroy your garment but um
[4990.88 → 4995.28] yeah i you know I'm just going to stick with the company line no do not tumble dry if it's bet
[4995.28 → 4999.44] it is better to hang dry your clothes and then if you just want them to be softer than you can throw
[4999.44 → 5004.16] them in the dryer for like five minutes um that's just a nice way to kind of soften them up after you
[5004.16 → 5008.40] hang dry them but one of the things that I'm going to be setting up for myself at the new house is
[5008.40 → 5015.20] one of those cool uh there's actually just little portable uh drying racks that are heated oh so it
[5015.20 → 5020.16] just makes the surrounding air a little bit warmer, and it creates natural convection that helps them to
[5020.16 → 5024.88] to dry things out faster and I'm going to switch to hang drying a lot more of our clothes instead
[5024.88 → 5029.04] of tumble drying it's way more power efficient obviously as well so that's that's one of my that's
[5029.04 → 5034.80] one of my things that I want to do at the new house any updates on the backpack uh I gave a
[5034.80 → 5039.76] big update on the backpack in the pc build stream that I did earlier this week it's kind of towards
[5039.76 → 5044.32] the end it should be as you scrub through it is should be pretty obvious where it is because i
[5044.32 → 5052.16] I'm holding a backpack a lot so you can go check that out there uh drake asks any tips on getting a
[5052.16 → 5057.12] super script stripped screw out of a motherboard I'm trying to get this motherboard out of the case for
[5057.12 → 5062.80] a new build for a friend keeping the case isn't an option sadly oh boy rubber band that's always been
[5062.80 → 5069.12] my first go true screw yeah there's like needle nose pliers there's um yeah yeah done that too
[5069.12 → 5073.12] man everything's risky especially if you have a working motherboard next to it like you could say
[5073.12 → 5077.12] okay yeah you just take a Drexel create a new slot head in it and then get it out that way but
[5078.32 → 5081.28] if you got a motherboard there you don't want to get metal shards all over it I don't think the
[5081.28 → 5086.16] rubber band's too risky no the rubber band's not that risky, but you might be hard to get access to it
[5086.16 → 5092.56] like that's fair especially if it's buried in a case which presumably it is man what would be the
[5092.56 → 5097.20] the best way to do that what I've done in the past is I actually put the rubber band on the screwdriver
[5098.24 → 5101.36] so like i I cover it on the bit and then I pull it all the way to the back so it's
[5101.36 → 5104.88] attached to the screwdriver so then I don't actually have to place it there yeah give it a shot
[5109.12 → 5112.96] Joshua minus seeing that it took a worldwide pandemic to start growing a beard
[5112.96 → 5119.04] when and what made you get rid of your pink hair and frosted tips um I think i just I thought oh
[5119.04 → 5126.16] I started working retail yeah yeah because uh when I met Ivan I had pink hair and then I just like
[5126.16 → 5129.92] didn't do it again after that and that was right around the time I started working at NCI
[5129.92 → 5135.20] did they ask you to or was that like a personal choice no I was doing uh student works no i just
[5135.20 → 5139.84] decided that going door to door trying to sell house painting service it probably wasn't a good idea
[5139.84 → 5144.88] to have like pink spiky hair makes sense yeah uh anonymous last week you mentioned not knowing
[5144.88 → 5149.36] much about metrology have you ever looked into any of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment that fabs
[5149.36 → 5155.04] used to make chips uh honestly we have not looked that deep into it, I have learned about some of that
[5155.04 → 5163.60] stuff uh as part of my trip to intel's fab, and you're right it is absolutely freaking wild uh Rory long
[5163.60 → 5167.76] time viewer first time caller love the show I had to pick up the ABCs of gaming for my nephew and a
[5167.76 → 5174.64] close family friend any idea when that pillow from last week will be available i uh I mean they're in
[5174.64 → 5182.40] the port I don't know what to tell you soon I'm sorry Han says I'm currently studying computer
[5182.40 → 5186.80] engineering I want to keep my options open however working in the tech journalism industry like Ltd would
[5186.80 → 5192.16] be awesome how can I make myself more attractive to employers in the industry honestly there's not many
[5192.16 → 5199.60] left that's a big part of the motivation behind labs there's just not a lot of tech journalism left
[5199.60 → 5207.36] so we want to try to resurrect that um as Ltd labs so honestly what we're looking for is a combination of
[5207.36 → 5213.36] hardware and software know-how we're looking for um enthusiasm like we want people who are actual
[5213.36 → 5219.12] enthusiasts rather than just engineers so that you know not just how to measure but what to measure
[5219.12 → 5225.76] if there 's's I know it's like a lame employer thing, but there are certain fields where
[5225.76 → 5230.48] you need to be inherently hungry for knowledge in that field, or you're not going to
[5230.48 → 5237.28] be good at that job yeah um like just straight up so yeah you should be interested in it, and you should
[5237.28 → 5243.12] probably want to have a drive to do a certain amount of it just kind of in your own time uh Ryan asks uh
[5243.12 → 5247.76] Linus Luke would you do a podcast with broken silicon also known for doing more's laws dead with tom and
[5247.76 → 5251.76] Dan I know they've been wanting to get you on at the beginning of the year in their podcasts I've
[5251.76 → 5257.84] never heard from them so uh if they yeah is they want to if they want to hang then um hey you know
[5257.84 → 5262.64] I'm I'm pretty easy to get in touch with to be perfectly to be perfectly blunt it's its not hard
[5262.64 → 5268.40] to reach me yeah if you are a creator with a significant following, and you email the official
[5268.40 → 5274.16] like Ltd email I mostly guarantee it'll make it to me, although things do slip through the cracks
[5274.16 → 5281.76] sometimes burn to notice burn Titus should I feel bad buying this mat since I bought two scalped cards
[5282.64 → 5290.40] for my first build which I'm starting this Christmas um hmm I mean I guess if you got scalped
[5290.40 → 5298.64] like you, you definitely you felt the pain you felt the pain, so there's that uh question for Luke any
[5298.64 → 5304.48] chance we'll get a float plane app on Google TV oh, oh man that was uh I think I know who this is um
[5305.12 → 5312.88] right now no there is a what is it hydra ion I believe is like a community created
[5312.88 → 5321.12] one that works um I'm not endorsing it I have not looked at the code um but yep and other than that
[5322.08 → 5326.08] not right now there are a lot of other things for us to work on here's a good one from kirk s what's
[5326.08 → 5334.16] the oldest tech you own and still use I'm going to have to think about this one for a minute yeah maybe
[5334.16 → 5340.00] let's like move on okay I'll leave it there for now yeah I'll leave it there for now yeah uh oh boy
[5340.00 → 5345.04] what is this something visualization software free to learn dead mouse uses it for his cubes
[5345.60 → 5350.40] vid idea oh touch designer the visualization software I'm going to be honest with you i
[5350.40 → 5356.48] don't know nearly enough about it to even begin to approach that yeah Misha could you make a key tag
[5356.48 → 5360.56] the way you have lanyards basically a lanyard but smaller to fully fit in your pocket
[5361.60 → 5369.04] um a key tag are key tags popular what are they for why do we want them um can I just
[5369.04 → 5377.68] see key tag oh like this thing oh my god people spend 18 on a Lululemon like thing just to like
[5377.68 → 5384.40] put on their keys so that they can just that they that you don't even see so just so they can know how
[5384.40 → 5390.96] Lululemon they are wait hold on what is this oh no it's pretty big it's huge so it doesn't fit in their
[5390.96 → 5398.64] pocket why we made this ah okay well that's a good question to answer take one thing at a time clip this
[5398.64 → 5407.12] embossed keychain onto your gym bag or backpack for easy access to your keys do your keys go in it is it
[5407.12 → 5407.76] a container
[5412.96 → 5414.32] no nope
[5418.80 → 5423.28] I have to confess this is one of those products that I just don't really understand so I think I'm
[5423.28 → 5433.76] probably going to not commit to have those on LTT store uh I mean yeah it seems cool um maybe
[5433.76 → 5439.92] I'm just maybe the reason I don't get it is I have so many keys that I just adding anything to my
[5439.92 → 5446.32] keychain seems like the last thing I would want to do the lanyard is so I can find them yeah uh and get
[5446.32 → 5450.80] them out of my pocket easily yeah and then everything else is just because i absolutely
[5450.80 → 5457.84] have to carry if it's like keys to my in-laws keys to my house keys to um the office keep like it
[5457.84 → 5467.68] cute it's a two oh man car fobs why are they so big I hate it like my two fobs one for the minivan
[5467.68 → 5472.72] one for my volt you really don't need to be very big it drives me crazy yeah can you get replacement
[5472.72 → 5480.48] once like is that a thing I don't think so I wonder if you can I replace my car fob
[5482.48 → 5490.88] the best way is to buy a new one from the car dealer all right thanks for the suggestion idiot
[5491.84 → 5498.32] um all right well let's put that away for now Linus current CS student and work at Best Buy
[5498.32 → 5502.32] in Washington have had three people come in that have ordered frameworks that were inspired by you
[5503.04 → 5507.20] I didn't so I thought this was pretty interesting I didn't know you could get a framework from Best Buy
[5507.20 → 5516.64] I had no idea is this must be super new um when it when this came in I was I had a big like
[5516.64 → 5524.16] what moment because like what the heck I don't know I don't see anything about it when I google it
[5524.16 → 5528.56] best buy dot com i just
[5531.12 → 5537.12] frame oh my goodness why pop-ups I'm on your site I am trying I'm trying to shop
[5539.84 → 5544.24] sorry I'm just I get triggered when I go onto a site I try to find something, and they're like
[5544.24 → 5549.60] hi there hi there no I know what I'm looking for oh okay well no I don't see anything
[5549.60 → 5556.72] on their site finding it yeah I really don't know I don't know what you're talking about um
[5558.08 → 5563.60] but hey I like the way you said it uh, uh wrote a paper on repairability this past quarter as well
[5563.60 → 5569.44] got an plus oh yeah okay sorry um it could be a third party seller potentially a prime said this
[5569.44 → 5576.48] in the float plane chat actually um oh and apparently AJ added a framework uh emote to the float plane chat
[5577.04 → 5583.20] that's awesome but uh it could be a third party seller maybe not sure I don't know seemed weird
[5583.84 → 5589.04] anyway moving on all right Joseph s I'm putting your merch message up but I'm going to advise
[5589.04 → 5595.84] against trying a Drexel on the motherboard thing because too much metal shard is not a good thing
[5595.84 → 5600.56] yeah Zeke says hey if you were to recommend any gaming monitor what would it be I've looked at the
[5600.56 → 5604.80] Samsung g7 thought that was the best overall because it's not super hard to drive because it's 1440p
[5605.52 → 5613.04] uh also do you own any crypto okay so let's do the monitor one first um LG's super low uh low
[5613.04 → 5617.76] response time panels are basically as good as it gets right now so if you can get something based on
[5617.76 → 5623.76] that um LG has their own products um whatchamacallit oh man that company that's super
[5624.48 → 5629.52] super controversial yeah eve has a monitor based on it, I'm not necessarily recommending that one
[5629.52 → 5634.64] because of their history, but maybe they're shipping them this time I don't know uh i I really don't
[5634.64 → 5639.04] know maybe they are I'm not I'm not out here to slander anyone maybe they're doing a great job this
[5639.04 → 5644.32] time, but they definitely have a checkered past um, so something based on that panel would probably be
[5644.32 → 5650.72] the way that I'd go 27 inches is still a real sweet spot for gaming 1440p 27 inch um 1440p starts to
[5650.72 → 5657.20] look a little pixelated at 32 inches but I did see it on the corsair xenon the other day and one of the
[5657.20 → 5663.76] things that contributes to image quality as much as pixel well not as much as pixel count but definitely
[5663.76 → 5668.72] like pixel count is contrast ratio, and it's super high contrast it looks really sharp I played some halo
[5668.72 → 5674.72] infinite on it looks real good nice and do you own any crypto so I have whatever crypto we have mined
[5674.72 → 5682.32] on the uh the lounge gaming pcs, and it's our it's our internal events fund I'm not an I'm not a serious
[5682.32 → 5689.76] holder by any stretch of the imagination um I might throw I might throw some uh we got that uh we got
[5689.76 → 5694.96] that CMP GPU that we did a video about a little while ago I'm thinking I'll throw it in the gym we'll just
[5694.96 → 5702.32] like have it sit and heat the gym you know like but i we're nothing, nothing serious ladies and
[5702.32 → 5708.64] gentlemen ever since I lost everything to quadriga cx uh I have not gone back in yeah that's fair
[5708.64 → 5713.20] yep uh nice says merry Christmas LTT are you looking forward to the new socket from AMD do you think it
[5713.20 → 5718.64] will be LGA or PGA I think it's rumoured to be LGA and yes I'm definitely looking forward to cooler
[5718.64 → 5723.12] stuff from AMD Jonah more actual tech tips to help with the production schedule as opposed to product
[5723.12 → 5729.84] showcases uh even process videos editing gaming etc it's harder than it sounds um honestly those
[5729.84 → 5734.80] videos are the ones that I want to focus on they're not they're not the ones that are easy and fast
[5734.80 → 5740.32] they're the ones that take the most time and so what I want to do is I want to distill LTT down to
[5740.32 → 5746.32] only the best that we make I mean I can even see right now just based on the last little while where
[5746.32 → 5753.60] we've where we've struggled uh viewership is pretty rough I think it's at its lowest in quite some time
[5753.60 → 5758.96] and Sancho too like normally we'd have probably in the neighbourhood of 10 000 live viewers on YouTube
[5759.92 → 5764.48] we're right in the actual oh no we're low on uh twitch today as well it might just be the holiday
[5764.48 → 5768.88] I mean it's yeah okay well yeah kind of okay never mind I'm not going to panic yet but
[5768.88 → 5775.92] yeah I definitely do want to figure out how to make LTT great again the next one show is
[5775.92 → 5782.64] probably also going to be pretty low because it's Christmas Eve um New Year's Eve but yes sorry yeah
[5783.36 → 5791.52] mason asks when's whole room water cooling too okay so I have a plan to water cool the server rack
[5791.52 → 5799.36] at the new house okay it will definitely involve piping water outside to a radiator ah sweet we're
[5799.36 → 5804.56] doing it are you looping in the pool is the whole thing happening I want to loop it into the
[5804.56 → 5810.56] pool but Jake and actually the manufacturer of the air conditioner heat exchanger one talked me out of
[5810.56 → 5817.92] that one oh but I am going to have solar panels that are dual-purpose so they are uh they're going to be
[5817.92 → 5823.60] electricity generation and water heating and those will go into the pool very cool so they'll
[5823.60 → 5828.48] just dump all the money into the pool yeah uh Chris s merry Christmas do you think the shortage will
[5828.48 → 5835.68] get worse with next gen cards coming soon I think it'll probably stay about the same um okay what is
[5835.68 → 5842.00] the oldest tech that you own and still use I think it's like because okay, so tech is technically an
[5842.00 → 5847.60] extremely broad term I mean you only recently upgraded your TV that was ancient, but you were
[5847.60 → 5854.40] upgraded it so you can't count that yeah this might be kind of lame but I think it's like the
[5854.40 → 5861.28] Bluetooth in my car that is lame yeah come up with something better 2009 come up with something in
[5861.28 → 5865.44] your house like do you still have your old ducky that you use every day no you don't you upgraded it
[5865.44 → 5869.28] yeah yeah uh let me think old pa monitor
[5869.28 → 5876.96] yeah that's it that's got to be it I still have the two Asus monitors that I bought when
[5876.96 → 5884.56] you first officially personally hired me so after the CX nine years ago yeah, yeah okay
[5887.04 → 5893.04] yeah, yeah okay um I think mine is probably my corsair SP 2500 speakers
[5893.04 → 5900.48] I also have those so you lied to me and those would be older than the monitor oh man
[5901.92 → 5910.64] ah so I got those uh from the corsair rep back when I did this unboxing of them
[5911.76 → 5919.28] over 10 years ago for NCI tech tips and the only reason I still use them is um
[5919.28 → 5926.48] um because I need a foot rest that's the main thing I use them for as well yeah oh and also
[5926.48 → 5931.60] uh a prime is calling you out what about your headphones actually I think your HD 595s are
[5931.60 → 5936.96] older those are even older I did a terrible job or five with this yeah 595 595s yeah I think those
[5936.96 → 5943.20] are from those are going to be like 15 years old yeah those are real old I actually mentioned to my
[5943.20 → 5948.64] girlfriend the other day that like once these die I'm going to be genuinely very sad no it's fine there's
[5948.64 → 5954.32] better there's more to life than 595s they're okay I really like my 595s I have picked up some 600s
[5954.32 → 5961.12] they're just they're 595s but better I don't like the dual cable oh my god I don't like it mod it
[5962.08 → 5966.48] what a fun project make it a single one yeah dual cables are stupid I modded my headphones like run
[5966.48 → 5972.96] it over top yeah you could totally do it that'd be interesting yeah he likes it yeah he likes he's not
[5972.96 → 5977.76] going to do it he's lazy, but he likes it I might, I've been trying to learn electronics in my spare time
[5979.20 → 5984.32] one of the few things I've been doing to be clear they're still decent i think people are
[5984.32 → 5989.84] going to be a little upset about me like trying to trash on the 595s just trying to mess with me
[5989.84 → 5996.56] uh i I really like those headphones yeah I was a five I was a 555 guy um and I got those around the same
[5996.56 → 6002.64] time but uh Jaden says I'm using the Sennheiser HD 600s came out in 97 I got them a year ago though
[6002.64 → 6008.64] yeah so I also have an old pair of HD 600s but I didn't get them new so i I didn't really count those
[6008.64 → 6013.92] I'm just trying to think if there's anything I think my 595s I think I'm on my like fourth or fifth
[6013.92 → 6020.72] set of uh ear pads, and it's gotten to the point where i I can't get Sennheiser ones anymore
[6020.72 → 6025.60] and it actually sucks because they're like way lower quality right I have to buy like third party
[6025.60 → 6034.00] ones um I think that would be a really cool thing for LTT store to tackle just like those kinds of
[6034.00 → 6040.64] uh longevity increasing accessories for really iconic products yeah it's hard to justify the
[6040.64 → 6044.80] kind of volume that you have to produce though yeah because I was just going to say like it's its
[6044.80 → 6054.00] they're pretty specific right yep yeah all right I think that is it for the show today thank you guys
[6054.00 → 6062.72] so much for tuning in we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel um
[6062.72 → 6068.48] just never got around to any that might surprise the audience um hey thanks Brian p sorry, sorry no
[6068.48 → 6072.32] more merch messages all right we have to go we have to go bye
[6074.80 → 6086.80] so
[6093.84 → 6097.60] brought to you by sonic all Tim and keep cutters
