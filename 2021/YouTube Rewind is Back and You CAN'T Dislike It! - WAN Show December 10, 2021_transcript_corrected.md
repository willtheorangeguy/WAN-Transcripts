[0.00 → 12.66] and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[12.66 → 24.24] YouTube rewind yeah it's going to get nothing but thumbs up because it's impossible to see anything
[24.24 → 32.46] else sort of and the RTX 2060 12 gig has launched and um in a massive shock to everyone it is not in
[32.46 → 37.56] stock anywhere what else we got this week the game Awards Awards Awards to games and announces
[37.56 → 44.88] announcements hooray wow okay we're going to have to talk about that it takes two one game of the year
[44.88 → 51.18] um we'll talk about that I promise in other gaming news the trailer for Ubisoft's NFT
[51.18 → 57.54] cosmetic system called quartz got so many dislikes it was unlisted I don't think automatically right
[57.54 → 62.76] like they just pulled it down uh I mean it can't happen automatically but yeah but how could
[62.76 → 67.50] it gets so many dislikes and how could anybody know well we're gonna talk about that too aren't we
[67.50 → 69.66] yeah, but first we're going to roll the intro yeah
[81.18 → 85.02] so many people unironically answering my question as though I don't know the answer to it
[85.02 → 92.22] the one about how you could possibly see dislikes and the show is brought to you by FreshBooks
[92.22 → 100.44] Redux and Anchor we talked about it on WAN show last week I I I I Luke I know that I needed
[100.44 → 104.10] to answer that part of your question you have to you what you need to do is look into your microphone
[104.10 → 109.54] oh I can hear myself so clearly though uh yeah maybe it's the headphones let's jump right into our
[109.54 → 117.70] first topic of the day uh wait is there even is this even like in the doc or what one uh the one
[117.70 → 124.18] about YouTube rewind coming back no it's not okay YouTube rewind maybe we'll talk about that in a
[124.18 → 134.98] minute let's do uh let's do our second topic of the day first topic is going to be that uh the RTX 2060
[134.98 → 141.46] 12 gig has launched and as you guys might have noticed we did a video about it talking about you
[141.46 → 150.58] know what a new RTX 2060 might be like how this might affect the overall supply of graphics cards for
[150.58 → 157.86] gamers why Nvidia might have made the seemingly somewhat controversial move of increasing it to 12
[157.86 → 165.46] gigs of gddr6 memory especially when you consider that some you know gddr6 shortages have occurred over
[165.46 → 175.38] the last year and a half and basically as far as we can tell this whole thing was super sketchy because
[175.38 → 181.86] this wasn't this was basically barely even a rumour until all of a sudden it went from barely a rumour to
[181.86 → 190.74] confirmed and launched over a span of days as far as we're aware no press were seated units for review
[190.74 → 196.18] so there was no real way to evaluate it in spite of the fact that it is a different card it's somewhere
[196.18 → 202.18] in between the 2060 and the 2060 super, and obviously it's got a larger frame buffer which we would have
[202.18 → 208.74] loved to investigate, but the official availability is supposed to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of
[208.74 → 216.98] around three to three and a half weeks after the actual launch which occurred on December the 7th
[216.98 → 226.66] or in early 2022, so this is actually about the most paper launch that we've seen in a very
[226.66 → 233.94] long time uh in fact it's its to the point now where when we did our video we did hear back from a
[233.94 → 241.46] board partner Asus got back to us, and we were like hey so obviously the burning question on
[241.46 → 248.18] everyone's mind is how much does this thing cost, and they were like if I know
[250.18 → 252.18] hope it worked yeah I hope the button worked
[254.42 → 263.06] um early European listings suggest a price of roughly 660 to 700 us dollars, although it's often not as
[263.06 → 271.94] simple as just doing a currency conversion from European pounds rubles whatever currency they
[271.94 → 277.94] have over there euros that's the one from euros or pounds or whatever other currency to us dollars
[277.94 → 282.82] a lot of the time it ends up being a lot closer to a one-to-one exchange rate even though that's
[282.82 → 289.78] really not how things work yeah um previous leaked listings from French e-tailor pc21 started at 500 us but
[289.78 → 296.42] they've been bumped up to around 609 and Anthony jumps in to say that this is pre-vat so that could
[296.42 → 304.42] be pretty rough especially when you consider the launch price of the RTX 3060 which was Luke
[305.62 → 314.66] where did it go I just saw 329 dollars 329 that's right the RTX 2060 and 2060 super both launched at
[314.66 → 323.78] 349 three years ago and are apparently now going to be relaunching at somewhere in the neighbourhood of
[323.78 → 330.02] 500 to 700 us dollars and that assumes that you can even find one in stock wouldn't that be sweet as a
[330.02 → 335.78] business the craziest part of this the craziest part of this it's basically real estate GPUs are behaving
[335.78 → 341.14] like real estate to the point where like okay honestly though Vancouver especially commercial real
[341.14 → 348.82] estate has gotten to the point where developers will just not sell things because it's actually
[348.82 → 356.82] more profitable to just build it and sit on it than it is to build it take a profit margin and sell it to
[356.82 → 362.34] someone to occupy especially when you can lease it while you sit on it and your profits go stones
[362.34 → 367.78] yeah um like really GPUs they're now it's free they're free real estate except they cost money
[367.78 → 378.74] um putting this in even more context the RTX 3080 okay the 3080 had a 699 us dollar MSRP when it first
[378.74 → 384.10] launched now there is one bit of extra information we have now that we didn't have before apparently
[384.10 → 391.78] the reason for it to have 12 gigs of dddr6 is that the 16 gigabit chips are more widely available
[391.78 → 400.58] although that sort of rings a little hollow when all of this stuff is basically unobtained um yeah
[400.58 → 406.42] also those chips are the same ones used for the RTX 3060 and could have possibly been used for the RTX 3050
[406.42 → 412.90] though as we mentioned in our video it is quite possible that NVIDIA is utilizing chip like c uh GPU fab
[412.90 → 422.66] capacity that would not have been possible to use for a RTX 30 series card oh man so if you can get
[422.66 → 429.94] one performance will be a lot worse than a RTX 3060 um, but it'll have a lot more memory and early
[429.94 → 435.94] reports indicate that the cards perform quite well for crypto uh right now because they're not late
[435.94 → 443.94] hash rate and get this conveniently whenever Ethereum eventually moves to proof of stake yeah
[443.94 → 450.58] these will be ready oh wait no it's not the proof of stake change that requires more VRAM is it
[450.58 → 454.50] I forget I'm a little I'm a little rusty on the details whatever there's supposed to be an Ethereum
[454.50 → 460.34] change at some point that made it require way more VRAM and this will be ready for it which kind of makes
[460.34 → 465.62] you wonder if NVIDIA just launched this to meet mining demand or if this has anything to do with meeting
[465.62 → 474.74] demand for gamers I seriously doubt the latter yeah okay you're probably not going to get one
[474.74 → 480.02] anyway so yeah so that's at least you know it's launching at least you're up-to-date on the
[480.02 → 488.10] tech news there you go yeah we can't uh we can't problem yeah we okay minor problem in other tech news
[488.10 → 494.26] sort of gaming news the game awards awards awards to games and announces announcements um there 's's
[494.26 → 498.02] a bunch of stuff there are a bunch of announcements first I think we'd skip all of that and go to the
[498.02 → 505.06] awards yeah sure best game direction I'm skipping game of the year we'll talk about that at the end
[505.06 → 512.34] fine okay i I did not watch the game awards it's so funny i um I didn't either i I'm far enough removed
[512.34 → 517.06] from it now that I think it's probably fine to talk about this, but you know how I was in an ad
[517.06 → 520.42] at the game awards I think it was either last year or the year before I can't remember
[520.42 → 527.94] um I was in a Samsung TV like yeah like ad spot during the game awards okay and like it was super
[527.94 → 532.50] cool to be part of that um it was really cool the way we were able to throw it together in our
[532.50 → 539.70] studio and like shoot effectively an ad that aired during the game awards which is like my initial
[539.70 → 549.06] response was game awards sorry is that like a big deal or I have literally never in my life watched the
[549.06 → 554.82] game awards because I like my understanding is its only been going on for like 10 years or so
[554.82 → 562.34] something like that how I think it's been a while um but it has been a big deal for quite
[562.34 → 568.34] a while yeah but see that's the thing is I basically took 10 years off gaming right while I founded a
[568.34 → 574.82] company and had kids and didn't play any video games so established in 2014 yeah so it's only been around for
[574.82 → 583.78] seven years so I was just like um yeah game awards yeah I mean that sounds super cool and um it sounds
[583.78 → 591.62] good that's awesome um but i yeah i have I'm so sorry everyone I have literally never watched
[591.62 → 596.26] the game awards yeah Joris says it's almost bigger than e3 at this point okay I know that e3 is irrelevant
[596.26 → 602.34] now but I didn't have time for e3 either we I think we attended e3 as a company once and I didn't go
[602.34 → 605.94] yeah and I determined it was a waste of time because I was the one that went yeah that was
[605.94 → 610.10] that was pretty funny you were because I think you were the one that pitched it to me yeah well the
[610.10 → 614.66] if we went the year before yeah it would have been awesome because there were like a console launch
[614.66 → 618.34] there were like two consoles launches the year before you went or something it wasn't even that
[618.34 → 622.98] there was actually a large amount of hardware companies that went and launched hardware there
[622.98 → 628.10] it was really weird and I was like okay if they're going to do this again then we should be big and then we
[628.10 → 632.02] went, and they didn't do it again because they probably went and decided it was a waste of time yeah
[632.02 → 637.78] right so that just a bit of a swing and a miss, and then we never went back anyway so uh so I don't
[637.78 → 642.34] I don't have a ton of context for any of this other than that you're about to tell me who won the game
[642.34 → 648.58] awards this year yeah best game direction death loop have you ever heard of it um I think I've heard
[648.58 → 652.82] of definitely I was going to say probably honestly the majority of people watching have yeah I haven't
[652.82 → 660.34] played it though pretty cool game concept I have not personally played it um but I can see why it could
[660.34 → 668.18] have won this category the best action slash adventure game metro id dread okay I have also not played it
[668.18 → 672.50] yeah but the things that it's against I could definitely see it winning that cool what did it
[672.50 → 678.26] go up against uh that I think probably I don't know but I think probably its strongest competition
[678.26 → 684.58] would have been uh Resident Evil village okay there was a lot of kinds of movement around that game i
[684.58 → 689.06] would have if I saw this list without the winner highlighted I probably would have suspected it was that
[689.06 → 693.86] one uh marvel's guardian of the galaxy also actually looks like an actually well-made game
[693.86 → 698.66] which you probably would not expect given the name because most games that are made off of movies are
[698.66 → 707.14] not very great yeah um most anticipated game was Elden Ring who also won the most anticipated game of last
[707.14 → 714.90] year um last year's list of most anticipated games is almost identical to this year's list of most anticipated
[714.90 → 720.82] games cool um I mean hey the truth is the same winner games take a long time to develop okay it does
[720.82 → 726.74] they do it's its it's very time-consuming it's a lot of work yeahs I'm really hyped for god of war
[726.74 → 732.74] Ragnarök the previous god of war was amazing I did hear that I wasn't a fan of the god of wars
[732.74 → 739.06] before the remake yeah but have you ever owned a PlayStation no but that type of game I'm also not into
[739.06 → 743.38] right okay like there are games like that on Xbox this one's more of like an adventure game it's really
[743.38 → 752.90] cool okay getting into the finale the best multiplayer game of the year it takes two oh so it's not game of
[752.90 → 762.02] the year it's also game of the year oh really we're doing multiplayer game first though so this happens to be
[762.02 → 771.78] the one like big release this year that I did play not true what whatever oh I played Manheim yeah
[772.58 → 778.26] Manheim came out this year I think so, and it takes two beat Manheim that's the astounding to me
[778.26 → 784.66] it beat new world that should be a given new world's trash it beat back for blood that should be a given
[784.66 → 789.86] in my opinion just go play left for dead 2 uh it beat monster hunter rise I never played that it beat
[789.86 → 796.02] knockout city I legitimately don't know what that is, but it beat Manheim that is very stunning to me
[796.74 → 805.54] okay, okay hold on a second float plane chat is not pleased fray says it takes two was an amazing game
[805.54 → 812.74] night pause says it takes two is a fantastic game to be fair all right one moment please it takes two
[812.74 → 818.50] to be fair all right one moment please it takes two is a beautiful game the environments the creativity that
[818.50 → 835.30] went into it are just outstanding but the story oh man spoiler alert okay you just keep chasing the McGuffin
[835.30 → 845.78] constantly it's just ah you have not come far enough yet I don't know what his accent is i I forget
[846.34 → 851.94] but have you played it no not, yet we're going to but not yet really okay so here's the problem like
[851.94 → 857.30] own it and I've been waiting but anyway yeah here's the problem with it takes two is that if you are a
[857.30 → 867.22] a non-gamer the puzzles and the level design are probably pretty creative and or maybe even a little
[867.22 → 875.70] bit challenging but for me as like someone who's been playing video games since I was seven or whatever
[876.26 → 885.70] sitting on the couch next to my wife it's a little hard to stay engaged not yeah not uh to oh night pause
[885.70 → 893.86] I am not at the end yet either I have gotten exhausted of collecting pages or collecting
[894.66 → 903.78] whatever's and because it's all just an excuse to and oh man the character development pacing is so
[905.14 → 912.34] bad like because they have to be they have to be okay again I said spoiler alert so I can talk about it
[912.34 → 917.78] so you've got this couple that are they're they're about to get divorced, and their child is sad and
[917.78 → 926.50] wants them to get together and first as a child of um divorced parents I think that any kind
[926.50 → 932.50] of narrative that somehow puts it puts the responsibility on the child to do anything uh get
[932.50 → 938.50] their parents together uh take responsibility for splitting them up whatever it is um is sorry
[938.50 → 947.62] it is I thought it was stupid it was just it was just stupid um you know two adults who can't
[947.62 → 952.82] stand each other should not get back together because the child is sad because a toxic environment
[952.82 → 959.46] quite frankly is probably not any better yeah um, so there 's's a lot of there's a lot of sort of
[959.46 → 966.66] I got baggage okay I got baggage anyway they start out kind of being sick of each other's BS
[966.66 → 974.26] she works all the time and he I don't know I forget what his sin is he doesn't help out enough
[974.26 → 981.38] or something i I can't remember, but the point is that though the kid is super sad and so there's this
[981.38 → 987.30] supernatural intervention that takes place where the two parents are turned into these uh these little
[987.30 → 994.42] doll representations of the little kids toys, and they have to go through this journey of
[994.42 → 1000.02] reconciliation with each other where they learn to work together, and they learn to cooperate and
[1000.02 → 1006.26] build each other's um build each other's relationship or build their relationship back up
[1006.26 → 1012.10] and because you need to see that development like that character development
[1012.10 → 1018.90] as you go through each challenge they like they learn to trust each other a little again and they
[1018.90 → 1023.62] they rediscover his passion for gardening please tell me there's a meter does the trust meter go up
[1024.90 → 1030.42] or they appreciate that she really does work really hard and that's her love language or whatever it
[1030.42 → 1035.94] is, and they make this progress, and then they dump you back to this NPC who guides you through the
[1035.94 → 1045.46] process, and they like immediately are back to full-on can't stand each other again, and then it resets and
[1045.46 → 1049.70] then they like to reconcile a bit again and then like immediately they're back to full-on can't stand each
[1049.70 → 1058.02] other again so it's this like the game can't decide how long it was supposed to be and in my opinion
[1058.58 → 1067.78] this is probably the only time in my uh this is probably the only time as a gamer ever where I've looked at
[1067.78 → 1074.90] a game and I've gone they had too much budget you know what I mean like you know how often it happens
[1074.90 → 1078.50] where you'll reach like the last third of a game you'll be like oh they ran out of time
[1079.06 → 1084.10] they ran out of budget yes that's definitely happened a lot whereas I think it takes two
[1084.10 → 1092.10] could have been an outstanding six to eight hour gaming experience right jam packed like a
[1092.10 → 1098.74] portal like experience Ubisoft has that issue right now with like all their games, but we've we've sat down
[1098.74 → 1104.66] I mean i I'd have to I'd have to check I actually don't know if origin has a log for how many hours you've
[1104.66 → 1112.10] put into a game I'm not 100 sure how I'd even check it, but we have put more than that in, and we're not
[1112.10 → 1120.26] done yet and um oh yeah right so Jr 69 55 says it seems like a couple's therapy game so that's the other
[1120.26 → 1130.74] issue is it's so repetitive because the lessons are always the same lesson work together yeah
[1131.62 → 1141.46] I got if it's in the title of the game I know right so give me some new give me some new character
[1141.46 → 1146.90] development my main problem with the game is not had a sequel where they decide to break up
[1146.90 → 1156.02] it takes only one, or they could have a polyamorous sequel it takes many it takes three or more
[1157.46 → 1166.02] oh man, so my issue is that while it's a beautiful game, and it ran flawlessly I didn't have any technical
[1166.02 → 1174.42] bugs with it and I thought the voice acting was pretty solid like overall solid it has a terrible
[1174.42 → 1180.50] story it had it has a terrible story it has a basically non-existent story it falls into that trap
[1180.50 → 1186.90] of storytelling that goes and then this happened and then this happened and then this happened and
[1186.90 → 1191.70] then this happened and then this happened it's like right but what are the consequences what are
[1191.70 → 1199.14] the out what's the outcome where's the but then there was this crazy thing no it just is
[1199.14 → 1206.10] always the same thing you always do what the guy told you to do, and you work together and each stage
[1206.10 → 1212.02] is like probably anywhere from half an hour to 90 minutes of gameplay, and you get through it, and it's like
[1213.62 → 1217.46] you need to work together some more, and you're like
[1217.46 → 1226.26] could we have worked together enough to do something and maybe the daughter does more than
[1227.06 → 1234.02] you know go around and see her sad mom sleeping on the couch or whatever and look like a creepy
[1234.02 → 1238.74] uncanny valley wow how does she look so weird character um
[1240.58 → 1245.38] knock 23 says the game isn't aimed at Linus the story follows a lot like a previous relationship I had
[1245.38 → 1255.46] well I mean it's not that I can't relate you know Ivan and I've been together 15 years you think we
[1255.46 → 1260.82] never fought about anything you know you think we haven't drifted farther and drifting closer and
[1260.82 → 1264.82] child of divorce, and we've actually had a lot of comments come in and saying like as a child of
[1264.82 → 1271.78] divorce this game just kind of pissed me off so um I don't know my parents are still chilling
[1271.78 → 1278.34] yeah you know what this is pretty good jr6955 says it's well I'm going to paraphrase a little bit but
[1278.34 → 1283.06] it's like uh it's like it constantly teases you, but you never finish you know so I haven't finished
[1283.06 → 1290.18] the game I never finished the game get your mind out of the gutter loop mind out of the gutter mind out
[1290.18 → 1293.86] of the gutter so I could back it maybe that has to be one of the story
[1293.86 → 1302.18] it's a problem anyway true Scott says he hasn't reached to bring back this back in your relationship
[1302.18 → 1308.10] part, yet that's the whole part that's the whole thing it's just the same thing over and over and
[1308.10 → 1313.38] over again is the multiplayer good to bring it all the way back to the award yes okay the co-op ness
[1313.38 → 1318.90] is good Jake's been in the chat he's like yeah I played it for half an hour with the GF um
[1318.90 → 1325.94] um they should have had difficulty tears it was way too easy for pretty much anyone that games like
[1326.50 → 1333.06] again I could, I can enjoy it from a wife is having fun and I'm spending time with her kind of
[1333.06 → 1338.02] perspective, but the thing is that even though she's certainly not a hardcore gamer she's absolutely
[1338.02 → 1343.70] capable of playing hardcore games yeah like she can play left for dead Team Fortress 2 like we could
[1343.70 → 1348.74] sit and play an actual game together very divisive and overcooked which like sure it's a game about
[1348.74 → 1354.10] cooking, but it's also like still a gamer game you said divisive I think you meant decisive
[1354.10 → 1359.46] sure okay did you meant that she causes divisions on the team or I don't think that's what divisive
[1359.46 → 1366.02] means yeah it does okay I think you meant good at delegating or something like that um sure yeah okay
[1367.94 → 1372.58] to be clear I mean if you think she's divisive that's fine i just really don't think that was what
[1372.58 → 1379.62] you meant like causing rifts disagreements no yeah that's not yeah okay cool um so yeah like
[1379.62 → 1384.02] she can like she can play games that actually require skill but because she hasn't played a lot
[1384.02 → 1391.06] of adventure games she's still like enjoying the puzzles whereas I walk into a room or a boss battle
[1391.06 → 1399.30] and I see the glaring weak point and the obvious sort of you know mechanism for it, I'm like oh okay
[1399.30 → 1405.30] this right yeah look for the glowing thing a game that I think did that and I've talked about it
[1405.30 → 1411.22] a million times but titan fall 2 the storyline is honestly really short I still need to play it but
[1411.22 → 1416.98] they never overuse any mechanics it's all its there are a few times when I'm like man like
[1416.98 → 1421.78] I really wish I had that for longer but then at the same time if I had it for too long i probably
[1421.78 → 1426.50] wouldn't think the mechanic was as cool it takes two actually does that really well as well okay so
[1426.50 → 1433.06] each of the new stages issues you new gameplay mechanics that you then use to solve problems
[1433.06 → 1439.78] so they're not interesting enough they're interesting, but the game is just too long okay the stages are too
[1439.78 → 1446.18] long and there are too many stages and there's not enough there's not a consistent character development
[1446.18 → 1451.54] that is taking place the way it feels and I could be totally wrong because I'm not an expert on the
[1451.54 → 1460.42] game development process but the way it feels to me is as though they set out with 10 or 15 or however
[1460.42 → 1467.46] many zones they are, and they set out with 10 to 15 teams and said create unique gameplay elements
[1467.46 → 1474.50] and create a bunch of puzzles for people to solve, and then they just put them all in an order
[1474.50 → 1479.70] that kind of felt good and so that's why you're going through this develop belt back to zero
[1479.70 → 1484.82] develop belt back to zero it's like playing Zelda games it's like playing all the Zelda games
[1484.82 → 1489.86] back to back to back to back where for whatever reason from one moment to the next link
[1489.86 → 1495.94] suddenly has amnesia and lost all of it, and you're starting over again, and it really just feels like
[1495.94 → 1503.94] that I'm talking about it takes two okay so just within the confines of the best multiplayer game
[1503.94 → 1511.62] award do you have any problems with that best multiplayer game multiplayer so here's an interesting
[1511.62 → 1519.38] conversation um you know one of the things that I noticed about YouTuber awards for example is that
[1519.38 → 1527.46] uh Mr beast has won creator of the year twice in a row sure I don't disagree so why can't a game
[1527.46 → 1533.38] win multiplayer game of the year twice in a row especially when you consider how game development
[1533.38 → 1541.46] has changed we don't get unless you're Ea we don't get just a new edition with a new year number tacked
[1541.46 → 1547.78] on to the end of it of fundamentally you know that genre every year I think it would have to be evaluated
[1547.78 → 1551.94] on the changes that happen to that game so if that is in my opinion if that game was still under heavy
[1551.94 → 1558.58] development sure so how about this let's take um let's take a game like okay you and I were had
[1558.58 → 1564.58] both been talking about how incredible it is that Anna 1800 is still in active development four years
[1564.58 → 1572.26] after release and not just like hey we added a new horse armour that you can buy yeah like since
[1572.26 → 1577.54] the game originally exciting updates since the game originally launched with two regions, so there's the
[1577.54 → 1586.66] old world and the new world they have since added the NASA region the arctic region a shed load more
[1586.66 → 1594.82] uh resident classes um like uh building types and not just building types but like fundamental changes
[1594.82 → 1600.34] to the way that you build your cities and develop your trade they've like they've
[1600.34 → 1607.38] they've really changed the game uh a lot and in positive ways I think I can't think of a
[1607.38 → 1612.66] an update other than potentially that one character I can't think of an update that like isn't cool
[1613.54 → 1619.70] the anarchist yeah that's the only one that I'm like yeah that character is sort of yeah i finally
[1619.70 → 1624.10] figured out how you get rid of his minds so we can talk about that later because we thought there was
[1624.10 → 1633.06] just this kind of like unassailable NPC, but you actually can do stuff okay so, so yeah multiplayer
[1633.06 → 1644.90] game yeah um, so the options are back for blood it takes two knockout city monster hunter rise new
[1644.90 → 1648.90] world Manheim I know you're not going to be able to comment on essentially any of those except for maybe
[1648.90 → 1656.34] valheim I mean was really awesome when I played it but I could see going for something a
[1656.34 → 1663.30] little lowest common denominator or maybe unique uh it takes two is an only co-op experience right
[1663.30 → 1668.02] yes yeah yeah there's not that many of those games they exist, but there's not that many of those games
[1668.02 → 1672.82] people are like that award exists it's called the best ongoing game right but what I'm saying is that with
[1672.82 → 1678.10] the way that games get developed like you look at I mean I wouldn't, I don't know if it was the first
[1678.10 → 1688.66] one but wow certainly mainstreamed it releasing a game once and then updating it and at sometimes
[1688.66 → 1695.86] actually making it better and other times usually not as much that's and that's fair criticism so
[1695.86 → 1702.02] you'd obviously have to legitimately make your game the best game again but i just i I don't know i
[1702.02 → 1707.86] don't really see a reason why you couldn't say you know what this particular game amazing
[1707.86 → 1712.90] uh yeah yeah Conrad says Final Fantasy 14 literally won an award and that's super cool I just don't
[1712.90 → 1718.58] see why you have to specifically carve out an ongoing game award I just don't see why you wouldn't just
[1718.58 → 1725.62] say okay yeah in this genre this happens to still be the best game I'd be okay with that yeah
[1725.62 → 1732.18] anyway um then moving on to the final one is game of the year the contenders were death loop it takes two
[1732.74 → 1738.82] metro id dread psychopath 2 ratchet and clank rift apart and Resident Evil village even how much
[1738.82 → 1742.98] everyone loved ratchet and clank i honestly I haven't played it again I don't have a PlayStation
[1742.98 → 1747.46] so I haven't played it but the feedback for a lot of these games was actually quite positive like
[1747.46 → 1755.30] overwhelmingly positive I think yeah um yeah I don't know I don't have anything more to say about it
[1755.30 → 1760.66] quite frankly i just I didn't I didn't play the other games so I can't really comment all I can say
[1760.66 → 1768.82] is that it takes two is a cool game but I have a really hard time accepting it as the best game
[1769.46 → 1776.34] if that makes sense yeah it, it was a risk-taking game and I could absolutely see it winning some kind
[1776.34 → 1783.06] of award sure I think it's really cool that pc gaming is finally getting couch co-op experiences that
[1783.06 → 1789.14] were really built for couch co-op instead of having it tacked on as an afterthought yeah but
[1791.46 → 1797.78] i uh yeah i just i I don't know i I game of the year i just I have such a hard time with beautiful
[1797.78 → 1803.78] beautiful game i just i I don't feel compelled to finish it i yeah I'd kind of argue this wasn't
[1803.78 → 1808.90] exactly the absolute strongest year ever yeah that's fair I mean I think if breath of the wild came
[1808.90 → 1813.38] out this year we'd probably be looking at a different outcome but yeah and a lot of
[1813.38 → 1818.58] the strong releases of this year came out like right now which is kind of hard to include in an
[1818.58 → 1823.86] award show that happened right now yeah maybe if Halo Infinite had come out when it was supposed to
[1823.86 → 1828.98] come out they would have had a shot at it and if it had co-op baked yeah like was what it was supposed
[1828.98 → 1832.98] to be when it was supposed to be that might have worked out pretty well for them and they i I wouldn't
[1832.98 → 1837.54] be surprised if there were some concerns about giving an award to a game that has so much backlash because
[1837.54 → 1840.98] there is a huge amount of backlash over the cosmetic system and all this kind of stuff and
[1840.98 → 1846.58] is there oh yeah as someone who has completely ignored it is hasn't been bothering me i I checked
[1846.58 → 1854.42] out the halo Subreddit once and went whoa and then kind of laughed and left because it was so negative
[1854.42 → 1858.02] everyone that I talked to about halo was like yeah that's really fun when you go on the halo Subreddit
[1858.02 → 1867.14] it's just hatred I'm like okay it's almost like you know communities that have been had
[1867.14 → 1875.54] become so jaded and so cynical just don't even want a w any more yeah I don't know I've been I've been
[1875.54 → 1885.22] having fun argue like I part of it is that I haven't touched a halo game since halo 2 yeah and i only
[1885.22 → 1891.46] really played halo 1 so you know for me everything's fresh oh wow this is so new wow this has gotten a
[1891.46 → 1902.02] a lot better what are all these guns um i Jaden refunded the campaign because he has a 1080 and
[1902.02 → 1906.74] he's having serious performance issues with a 1080 with a 1080 he sure as heck won't be buying anything
[1906.74 → 1913.54] higher end than a 1080 these days I mean man I don't I'm not I haven't like dove into it or anything but
[1913.54 → 1918.18] yeah he refunded it because he found it unplayable like even 1080s are worth like are they worth like five
[1918.18 → 1921.94] six hundred dollars still or something stupid like that it's not a cheap card right now yeah it's not
[1921.94 → 1926.74] a good time to upgrade Conrad says it's fantastic most people that I've heard from have said it's
[1926.74 → 1933.62] fantastic Jaden as far as I know liked it a lot but then when it was like in like contained corridors
[1933.62 → 1937.62] and stuff, and then it became open world, and it was just unplayable I've heard there's performance
[1937.62 → 1943.62] issues on the consoles out in the open world uh in the open world parts as well makes sense uh but I'm
[1943.62 → 1951.38] my brother asked me to wait oh you know what I was about to ask you to wait yes yeah I was gonna
[1951.38 → 1955.54] I was going to say yeah we should just wait and co-op it yeah I haven't played yet that's that's my
[1955.54 → 1959.78] current plan is I'm waiting for co-op to open up yeah probably going to end up playing co-op with like
[1959.78 → 1964.18] a bunch of different people yeah and that sounds great yeah but I don't yeah I don't think I want
[1964.18 → 1970.58] to play it single player i never really played halo single player well it's because you had an Xbox
[1970.58 → 1975.94] that's true I played it single player because the pc version of halo one didn't have co-op
[1977.06 → 1982.42] yeah but like i always I don't know yeah I had it on Xbox and I always played it halo 1 and halo 2
[1982.90 → 1988.10] and halo 3 a little bit but mostly the one and halo 2 um I played with my dad or my brother or
[1988.10 → 1992.50] my friends or whatever i never really played halo alone so playing halo look at this guy flexing his
[1992.50 → 1997.06] Xbox and his friends growing up and the fact that his parents took an interest in video games with
[1997.06 → 2004.74] him Luke could you like could you attack me more hey man we can play when it when co-op comes out
[2004.74 → 2009.78] okay all right after it gets delayed three times all right we'll play we'll play in 2023 yeah 2023 no

[2139.30 → 2151.86] quiz for each other oh okay, okay all right yeah wow this is very judgmental yeah wow um tech
[2151.86 → 2160.50] snobbery 10. Style you say what the heck is tech style hmm I feel like I have none of it oh no someone
[2160.50 → 2166.02] has hacked your friend's computer and their files and this is hilarious their files and data are about
[2166.02 → 2172.10] to be published all over social media what do they do oh man this is great I can't wait to i can't wait
[2172.10 → 2184.74] what do they do what do they do oh wow should I answer this honestly uh I don't know man it's up to you
[2185.78 → 2193.54] oh okay I'm just going to answer it as honestly as I can so old it takes 30 seconds to open an app the battery
[2193.54 → 2204.50] last only 10 minutes from a full charge where do they look for a new phone um okay
[2208.82 → 2209.62] oh man
[2212.34 → 2213.22] oh man
[2215.78 → 2222.10] sure yep OMG your friend's house is on fire don't worry the pets are safe it looks like they only have time
[2222.10 → 2234.26] to rescue their phone and one other device which do they take oh man uh oh man
[2239.22 → 2245.78] yeah I'm going to go with this one okay we think your friend would like wow this is a really, really bad
[2245.78 → 2252.02] suggestion um okay are you almost done I'm almost done yeah okay I'm going to have to hear your
[2252.02 → 2253.46] answers this is hilarious
[2259.22 → 2264.74] are you still on question three Luke yeah i all the answers sucked no I don't think you would do
[2264.74 → 2271.22] like I don't think any of those like correctly apply to you at all anyway um okay all right well I'm
[2271.22 → 2278.18] gonna talk through um what it suggested for Luke we think your friend would like an anchor 622 magnetic
[2278.18 → 2286.58] battery uh mag go it appears to be like an iPhone MagSafe battery that also acts as a stand
[2288.34 → 2295.22] did it suggest the same bloody thing to both of us okay what were your answers can we go back through
[2295.22 → 2299.46] the quiz I didn't even like them like i I feel like you're going to be like no it should have been
[2299.46 → 2302.82] something else and I'll be like yeah you're probably right because like a lot of them I don't think
[2302.82 → 2308.10] apply how do we go back uh you can't oh you just do it again so I said your tech addiction was pretty
[2308.10 → 2312.98] strong your technology was not quite as strong I had you had a two for tech snobbery and a one for
[2312.98 → 2318.34] textile those are probably both fine yeah realistically I did 10 10 10
[2318.34 → 2326.58] three or four yeah okay so for thanks so for the hacked your friend's computer um I put that
[2326.58 → 2334.58] you would uh okay next hack the hacker and steal their picks in retaliation okay and what did you say
[2334.58 → 2339.70] uh I said calmly contact customer service and the authorities and hope they can stop it yeah okay
[2339.70 → 2344.82] I wouldn't, I wouldn't have any illusions that they can stop it but no, but that's sort of what we've
[2344.82 → 2351.22] we've tried to because there was the twitter thing forever ago right yeah so I thought back to
[2351.22 → 2356.26] I did contact the authorities yeah in that case it was because like they could do something so it
[2356.26 → 2360.50] wasn't directly yeah yes I wasn't like directly answering the question but like this is as close
[2360.50 → 2364.26] as I can get your friend's phone is so old it takes 30 seconds to open an app and the battery lasts
[2364.26 → 2369.54] 10 minutes I said who cares if it has a screen and fits in their pocket that's enough that's probably
[2369.54 → 2374.58] accurate I said they've been waiting for the new snapdragon chip for a year no I think that I think
[2374.58 → 2379.06] that's pretty fair yeah for VR headsets are now so advanced you can't tell the difference and
[2379.06 → 2382.50] everyone has one how does your friend use theirs I put that you'd hack it and use it to emulate nest
[2382.50 → 2387.78] games nice does that seem like the closest one no I probably do fight aliens in a
[2387.78 → 2391.86] distant galaxy I don't know okay I was Memling a little bit because I feel like nest games in VR would
[2391.86 → 2397.06] just kind of be terrible you'd still do it at least once yeah that's true, so my answer was not wrong
[2397.06 → 2404.98] it just wasn't that's the most right i I said number one yeah I mean if they're not more like
[2404.98 → 2411.06] blocks in distant galaxies yeah because that's the only thing I fight in VR is yeah i just I looked at
[2411.06 → 2414.66] the other ones I'll say he's not gonna use this as a doorstop yeah I don't think he's going to use it to
[2414.66 → 2420.26] work with others in VR environments like that's not a thing I strongly prefer for a technophile i
[2420.82 → 2425.86] strongly prefer in person yeah like I feel like four would be the most wrong like i it's its a really
[2425.86 → 2431.70] funny thing I'll be I'll be travelling right and this even goes like before my most recent trip
[2431.70 → 2437.94] I'll be travelling and uh my wife will call me at like you know kind of close to bedtime she'll be like
[2437.94 → 2442.10] hey do you want to say good night to the kids and have a video call I'm like no not really
[2444.42 → 2450.50] I want to see i I don't like I don't like talking to people on the phone I don't like talking to people
[2450.50 → 2458.98] on video chat at the same time though it's very good I feel like it's a needed thing in some yeah
[2458.98 → 2464.10] for sure, but it's just it's not my jam if I can avoid it i would realistically if someone
[2464.10 → 2471.30] moved too far away I would just fall out of contact with them, i i know i I sound like I sound like
[2471.30 → 2477.78] a heartless b-word but i just i just I'm not I'm not I mean that's a reality that happens
[2477.78 → 2480.58] with a lot of people so being honest about it, I don't think it's negative I'm not going to get on
[2480.58 → 2487.14] a video call with you every Saturday and be like hey I'm the same type of person I'm sorry i
[2487.14 → 2492.50] just yeah you moved I didn't move, and it means nothing, nothing personal right yeah yeah
[2492.50 → 2497.46] it's just not how it's just it's just not my jam yeah and question four the unfortunate thing about
[2497.46 → 2506.10] question four is they didn't have an answer that was my data I would run for my server yeah 100 that is
[2506.10 → 2510.50] the only thing in my house that has in fact I wouldn't even bother with my phone what I need
[2510.50 → 2516.10] my phone for I would run straight for the server and I would try and rip as many drives out of it as
[2516.10 → 2522.58] I can so what did you put for me for you, I put you've got it stored in an expensive protective case
[2522.58 → 2527.70] so you can just grab that i kind of like it was a bit of a throwaway it was a bit of a throwaway
[2527.70 → 2532.98] because it was kind of like oh well he's probably you know got his data backed up and doesn't care about
[2532.98 → 2537.86] anything yeah i I had the exact same reaction to this I almost clicked on the protective case one
[2537.86 → 2543.62] for the exact same reason that you did the one that I selected was their smartwatch because it said
[2544.26 → 2549.22] uh what's the point of being alive if they don't have the data to prove it and I was like the only
[2549.22 → 2555.30] thing he would save is the data so it wasn't about the smartwatch right I was just like none of these
[2555.94 → 2562.66] there's no way he's going to grab his PS5 he wouldn't waste any amount of time doing that so that's dumb I don't
[2562.66 → 2567.46] even have one I know he doesn't have anything stored in an expensive protective case so I'm
[2567.46 → 2573.38] not I thought about like maybe that's enough of a whatever but I didn't bother and then like they're
[2573.38 → 2579.22] nothing I'm like well he's not going to grab nothing either yeah so I don't yeah I just remember that
[2579.22 → 2585.46] thing so I did take the quiz again oops yeah put in different information I got something else in
[2585.46 → 2591.14] conclusion oh did you okay yes this the stream is brought to you by anchor give the gift of anchor
[2591.14 → 2594.42] power products just because it didn't get the recommendation right for us doesn't mean they
[2594.42 → 2598.90] don't have lots of good products so go check it out try the quiz and all that good stuff okay Jake
[2598.90 → 2606.82] I've actually done it twice now Jake is going to flip if we don't eventually show the pictures oh yes we've
[2606.82 → 2612.98] got pictures of the lab this is going to be pretty freaking cool don't worry Jake I wasn't ignoring you we
[2612.98 → 2617.06] were going to get to it, we were going to get to it, i know you're petty like that maybe I'll delete the
[2617.06 → 2625.78] photos you wouldn't, you wouldn't so guys the reno of the lab is almost done because we were
[2625.78 → 2631.54] keeping it pretty simple keeping it pretty simple here so we've got uh some fresh paint
[2631.54 → 2639.38] on the walls we've got some fresh access control going on we've got uh fresh security cameras in there
[2639.38 → 2645.94] got that ubiquity goodness what else we got going on here oh I think this is more of the uh that this is
[2645.94 → 2653.30] probably POE for the access control I'm guessing it's sound oh yeah yeah yeah we'll, we'll show that
[2653.30 → 2657.62] we'll show that we're just in the front entryway Alan, and we haven't gotten that far yet uh the
[2657.62 → 2663.22] floors I think we decided are we changing the carpet downstairs no we're just leaving it we're just
[2663.22 → 2669.62] redoing the stairway just the stairwell yeah the stairwell carpet is shockingly ugly yeah so this room
[2669.62 → 2676.10] no longer looks so oppressive anymore which is nice fortunately whoever was in here
[2676.10 → 2682.26] before actually did a lot of power and networking stuff that we just now don't have to do that's what
[2682.26 → 2687.22] I said oh Jake says that's the oh that's the fibre run oh that's what you're talking about yeah I said
[2687.22 → 2693.22] that earlier I said yeah so uh this is where the fibre terminates oh this is where the d mark is okay
[2693.22 → 2698.18] so we got fibre into the building uh this is where it was run to so we would have had to have our
[2698.18 → 2702.58] networking equipment just sitting right in the front entryway which would have been really stupid
[2702.58 → 2711.62] so uh Jake and the boys um they what what what it what is this did you guys just you didn't
[2711.62 → 2716.26] splice it or anything right it's just like a coupler I think they just coupled it, and then they ran it
[2716.26 → 2721.38] over somewhere else we'll see that in a little bit so it kind of runs above us in fact I think it runs
[2721.38 → 2726.58] along this cable management line right here uh so they painted I believe the ceiling might have been
[2726.58 → 2731.86] already black in here, but they painted the wall so it looks a lot nicer in here and then out in the
[2731.86 → 2738.34] uh in like the warehouse and what will actually be the lab um we painted so looks a lot nicer in terms
[2738.34 → 2744.90] of like colours you guys won't see this part above but what you will do is you will hear it yeah uh we
[2744.90 → 2751.54] used the same as cellulose spray or something very similar to what we did what we coded our existing
[2751.54 → 2757.14] studio with and man does it ever make a difference even without any of the equipment in there you can
[2757.14 → 2763.30] actually carry on a conversation now instead of it just being like a ridiculous amount of reverb to
[2763.30 → 2769.86] the point where you can barely understand your own voice um here's this from the alternate
[2769.86 → 2775.14] angle yeah it was terrible I like the orange accent by the way yeah right even though it's
[2775.14 → 2779.46] just like a little splash I think it's good yeah I just want it to have a little bit of LTT you know
[2779.46 → 2784.58] yeah yeah um Yvonne did the actual colour scheme I was like hey I just want like a little bit of
[2785.30 → 2791.62] orange and kind of grays and dark colours kind of thing yeah, and she made it she made it happen
[2791.62 → 2796.18] that's good stuff so yeah it looks awesome um goes all the way over here over by the door
[2799.06 → 2804.02] uh okay yeah there you go let's see if we're heading upstairs yeah there you go so the paint
[2804.02 → 2809.06] upstairs makes this part look a lot nicer as well one of the things I noticed when I was up in this room
[2809.06 → 2816.50] today is that the HVAC is crazy loud in this room so if we were going to have any hopes of doing
[2816.50 → 2824.66] anything acoustic related inside the office space I think we might just um need to give up on that it's
[2825.38 → 2829.78] super loud part of the problem though might be that they've got it running full tilt right now
[2829.78 → 2837.86] because uh part of the curing process for that um insulating and acoustic spray is that it off gases a
[2837.86 → 2844.02] lot of crap so you want it just yeah pumping everything out of their yeah um what you well
[2844.02 → 2851.54] what you want ideally is you want um you want to do it in the summer you want to open up your bay door
[2851.54 → 2858.74] and you want just hot air circulating yeah pumping uh Jake says the furnace is like right there the HVAC
[2858.74 → 2863.54] probably going to have to be boxed yeah we'll figure all that stuff out though give us time here's our sick
[2863.54 → 2869.62] sick networking closet by the way great job of the cable management Jake it looks gorgeous
[2869.62 → 2874.42] gorgeous I actually don't think he did most of it I think most of it was one of our new guys who are
[2874.42 → 2881.30] still on probation so um yeah I shouldn't give maybe shouldn't give maybe Jake too much credit for the
[2881.30 → 2885.86] little nitty-gritty details there are some comments in the chat that that little balcony thing
[2885.86 → 2891.06] um with the little hobbit door below it uh you have a fire pole
[2892.50 → 2899.06] hmm so the problem with that idea I mean aside from it being stupid is that um
[2901.06 → 2907.94] it's stupid okay what else do I need no there's like insurance problems yeah it's really it's really
[2907.94 → 2911.86] not going to be a thing it's not going to be a thing Jake says I replaced the cables with small patch
[2911.86 → 2919.54] cables by the way Jake I saw the green patch cables that you got for the pink rack I'm not sure if i
[2919.54 → 2924.42] was supposed to see those yet but I saw the box of them and I'm extremely excited so we're going to have
[2924.42 → 2929.54] the uh like the mesh front door the pink mesh front door and then there's going to be just like green patch
[2929.54 → 2935.78] cables behind if it's going to be freaking awesome nice yeah I'm super excited uh what else we got for
[2935.78 → 2941.62] topics today is there really anything else to talk about the matrix gets an Unreal Engine 5
[2941.62 → 2947.78] experience on consoles so epic surprised everyone with a showcase of ue5 called the matrix awakened
[2947.78 → 2955.38] during the game awards digital foundry is very impressed which is a good sign yep uh so I mean
[2955.38 → 2959.38] just to be clear it's not a game it's a tech demo, but there is a little bit of gameplay a little bit of
[2959.38 → 2968.26] exploration and uh it's the most Unreal Engine 5 that anyone's been able to actually try so um it's
[2968.26 → 2974.42] sort of showcase kind of like that rock lumen demo thing from may have last year, but it looks
[2975.22 → 2983.46] pretty freaking incredible yeah looks pretty amazing uh I don't know if I'm allowed to
[2984.34 → 2989.30] show it is I going to get is this stupid video going to get claimed if I try to show it definitely might
[2989.30 → 2994.18] yeah maybe just go look it up yourself yeah go look it up yourself super cool though uh
[2994.18 → 3002.34] yeah yeah I'm just we're just not gonna we're just not going to do it uh and what else we got here
[3002.34 → 3009.22] today lab renovation Ubisoft NFT thing oh do we really have to talk about it no, no lets do it let's
[3009.22 → 3014.82] do it let's do it hit me the trailer for Ubisoft's NFT cosmetic system quartz got so many dislikes it was
[3014.82 → 3021.22] unlisted uh the trailer went up on December 7th and the first supposed game will be ghosted Brecon breakpoint
[3021.22 → 3028.10] uh it was later delisted the video that is uh, but the link is still around the because I mean it's
[3028.10 → 3032.82] unlisted so as long as you have the link you can find it they're the first major publisher to go live
[3032.82 → 3039.30] with a NFT system basically every cosmetic is a unique digit with a serial number attached to it
[3039.30 → 3045.46] which is engraved on the cosmetic item there will be limited edition quartz cosmetics uh there's metadata
[3045.46 → 3051.14] belonging to each cosmetic will which will have the previous owner history uh you can obtain your
[3051.14 → 3058.82] favourite streamers used cosmetics at exorbitant prices nice just in case uh underpants were out of
[3058.82 → 3066.10] fashion the baby water the yeah the beta for quartz has already started in select countries, and you can
[3066.10 → 3074.26] check it out at uh I mean if you want at quartz.ubisoft.com full rollout starts in 2022. And uh the
[3074.26 → 3079.46] announcement was super popular you can see that it's got oh actually you can't see anything of the sort
[3079.46 → 3085.14] because our window is in front of it uh one moment please nope you still can't uh scroll down
[3087.14 → 3099.62] oh Lord it got 228 000 views okay and one and a half thousand thumbs up wow that must be a really
[3099.62 → 3106.74] really popular announcement that they made, and it's so useful that we don't have a way to
[3106.74 → 3114.34] uh we don't have a way to you know express our displeasure in a way that brands actually suffer for
[3115.70 → 3126.18] um except we kind of still do so if you get the return YouTube dislike Chrome extension book
[3126.18 → 3128.42] book book book book book book
[3128.42 → 3137.38] and I'm not going to turn on sync you can actually i believe it still works until like two
[3137.38 → 3143.06] days from now no it doesn't seem to be oh yeah there we go there we go the bar is here 39 000 dislikes
[3143.06 → 3152.26] who, so this is the big problem this is the big problem is that when YouTube removed the dislike button
[3152.26 → 3158.02] and it's going to happen so I think December 12th is the drop-dead date for removing API access to
[3158.02 → 3163.30] dislikes is that something like that yeah I think it's coming up quick it's coming up real quick these
[3163.30 → 3169.06] kinds when that happens these kinds of extensions and these kinds of workarounds are going to go away
[3169.06 → 3174.74] they will not work anymore, and you will have no way of knowing looking at this video how nearly
[3174.74 → 3183.14] universally unpopular this move is um and this I don't you know I don't want to I don't want to
[3183.14 → 3189.46] belabour the point but I think this is such a perfect example of the kind of stuff that is going to be
[3189.46 → 3198.26] so much easier to get away with and that seems to indicate YouTube's at least um secondary motive
[3198.26 → 3207.78] for making this move because in a big surprise move YouTube is bringing back a rewind replacement
[3207.78 → 3213.78] of sorts it's not going to be called rewind stream right because I think they would be crazy to call
[3213.78 → 3220.42] something rewind at this point but I can tell you right now it sounds honestly kind of cringe of course
[3220.42 → 3228.18] it does so here's how it's going to work it's a live interactive stream on December the
[3228.18 → 3236.82] 16th conveniently going to be a live chat four days after the dislike button goes away ah good totally
[3236.82 → 3245.30] a coincidence Luke and using the live chat users will participate in challenges based on trends from
[3245.30 → 3254.02] this year get involved in real-time experience and answer trivia questions when viewers compete complete
[3254.02 → 3260.50] all the challenges they'll be able to watch a musical performance from a mystery guest oh
[3264.66 → 3274.26] that reward is that the most try hard that you have heard all year ah if is the the the thing that
[3274.26 → 3283.70] I'm trying to think about is like if steam did a thing where they were like okay we're going to have an
[3283.70 → 3289.14] event there are a bunch of challenge things you can do and if you do them some cool thing will happen
[3289.14 → 3295.94] but you don't know what it is I might partake but because it's YouTube i I hate it, but it's not
[3295.94 → 3301.86] even I don't know how fair that is it just is probably going to be awful oh yeah they've got
[3301.86 → 3307.38] some good guests apparently BTS is going to be on there so surprise that's who I assumed the reward
[3307.38 → 3314.58] was going to be um and many popular YouTubers will appear including mark Robert so that's cool nice but
[3314.58 → 3323.94] I just do not foresee any possible way that this will be anything other than cringe it's called escape 2021
[3323.94 → 3336.10] uh yeah something like that so i basically my point is it is this really throws YouTube's
[3336.10 → 3344.02] intentions into question um just with this very suspicious timing yeah I know that they were working
[3344.02 → 3350.10] on this for quite some time, but this just really does not look like an accident and then that Ubisoft
[3350.10 → 3358.10] thing is an example of public pressure which is one of the few ways that we can affect any kind of
[3358.10 → 3365.70] change in our corporate over overlords public pressure caused Ubisoft to at least be ashamed enough of this
[3365.70 → 3374.10] concept for now to pull the video to unlisted and this is the end of it in two days you will no longer
[3374.10 → 3380.66] have any ability to push back all they'll have to do is disable comments or moderate the comments
[3380.66 → 3386.66] which is more likely and people coming along this let's say let's say impressionable young people who
[3386.66 → 3393.06] don't sort of fundamentally understand how stupid and potentially exploitative this concept is oh yeah
[3393.06 → 3401.06] will have no idea how horrible it is like more transparency is always better, and you should always
[3401.06 → 3406.26] be outraged when transparency is being pulled away from you there's also creators that will just I don't
[3406.26 → 3410.58] even know what it's called favourite or whatever it shows the creator's circle thing in a heart
[3410.58 → 3415.14] yeah, and it puts it at the top there are creators that will just like bomb their own videos with those
[3415.86 → 3421.30] they'll just heart like every single positive or neutral comment and there's so many of them that
[3421.30 → 3424.10] it takes forever to scroll through it scroll through it scroll through it scroll through it, you'll never
[3424.10 → 3431.38] really find the negative ones so yeah I'm really frustrated um
[3434.34 → 3441.38] there's another oh there's another issue uh oh no sorry Ryan 77 627 says hey not exactly the
[3441.38 → 3446.58] extension will switch to cached slash estimated versions of dislikes once the API is fully deprecated
[3446.58 → 3451.46] it will not be as accurate, but it will certainly give a number there are a lot of videos that launch on
[3451.46 → 3456.18] YouTube every day and a big part of the problem is product launches from companies yeah which that
[3456.18 → 3460.82] won't matter for i I brought that up last week I think that is very cool and honestly in a lot of
[3460.82 → 3466.02] ways I think that is very important and there are ways that you can contribute and help those programs so
[3466.02 → 3476.66] if you want to go do it um, but it is extremely far from solving the problem uh Jake I actually was not
[3476.66 → 3481.94] following this apparently there's a zero-day that originated from minecraft servers that caused a huge
[3481.94 → 3485.62] poo storm do you have any more details on this no I don't actually um
[3487.70 → 3494.18] i I heard people talking about it during the show yeah yeah i I'm seeing articles from like six hours
[3494.18 → 3499.22] ago I wouldn't have heard about this got it i Cassie says I wonder when Linus is going to release his
[3499.22 → 3504.58] book I have made basically zero progress on it, I haven't touched it since the last time we talked
[3504.58 → 3510.98] about it which was I think when wans ho was in office pre-lockdown so that should give you some
[3510.98 → 3516.42] idea I mean realistically I don't think my book would be worth reading until I've bowed out of the
[3516.42 → 3526.26] industry and I'm ready to just go tell all on it so yeah probably not anytime soon uh wow I don't know
[3526.26 → 3531.06] about you but I have not been on the ball on the incoming merch messages I've done some of them but I keep
[3531.06 → 3538.26] forgetting yeah so how soon will it be where we can just click show even after the thing expires and
[3538.26 → 3543.94] it can just show it, but that doesn't really work because right now it's it shows it without a message
[3543.94 → 3551.30] when it expires oh uh what if we just showed it again I mean because that would be a lot better than
[3551.30 → 3558.58] having to like directly address bananas for the boys from Ryan bananas for the boys what do you
[3558.58 → 3564.90] mean you don't want to address that come on oh not really come on not really all right is there
[3564.90 → 3569.30] anything else to talk about other than I'm sure Conrad could find a way to make that Ubisoft crap
[3570.50 → 3576.34] uh I guess that's it no all right cool let's do some merch messages yeah uh for those of you who are
[3576.34 → 3582.82] leaving super chats you guys are doing it wrong merch messages are the way to send paid messages
[3582.82 → 3588.66] to the show because that way at least if we don't get to your message you still get your order hey
[3589.22 → 3596.82] there's no way for us to lose also, and it functions super chats are broken, and you know I don't want to i
[3596.82 → 3601.30] don't want to throw anyone under the bus because they're really trying to help but the workaround that
[3601.30 → 3608.10] I was offered for it was you know okay what's the saying when the cure is worse than the disease
[3608.10 → 3612.82] yeah I don't I don't know what it is but yeah yeah i just really don't think it made a ton of sense so
[3612.82 → 3617.22] super chats unless I happen to remember to click the viewer activity tab right at the beginning of the
[3617.22 → 3623.38] show are still broken for me so what you really need to do send a merch message you go to lttstore.com
[3623.38 → 3627.78] check out some cool stuff we got toques we got water bottles we got northern lights' desk pads
[3627.78 → 3633.30] we've got hoodies we've got t-shirts we've got the party shirt we've got all kinds of good stuff
[3633.30 → 3637.62] over there and then in the checkout you can leave a little message, and it'll pop up on the show
[3637.62 → 3643.62] assuming that Luke and I managed to actually see the there is another thing to talk about by the way
[3643.62 → 3648.26] oh what is it the uh the game awards we talked about the awards we didn't talk about the announcements
[3648.90 → 3655.06] oh okay there's a few telltales is back they're making a video game adaptation of the Amazon
[3655.06 → 3661.06] original TV series the expanse never watched it and probably won't play it nice i I did like wolf
[3661.06 → 3667.06] among us even though it got kind of samey, and clearly they were not focused on it towards the
[3667.06 → 3673.54] towards the end yeah yeah the middle uh yeah I've always had problems with this name but senna
[3673.54 → 3678.98] senna's saga hell blade 2 a lot of people are really hyped about that and Alan wake to both got
[3678.98 → 3682.66] announced people are really hyped about those sure the matrix awakened we actually mentioned that earlier
[3682.66 → 3688.42] so I'm going to skip past it uh in an effort to get a bigger slice of the battle royal pie that helped
[3688.42 → 3693.70] bake pub g is going free to play actually kind of interesting um there's going to be some
[3693.70 → 3701.30] noobs to headshot yeah are you gonna play uh if I mean I have never thought that game was cool solo
[3701.30 → 3706.66] so if other people want to play I'm down right that's pretty much it um wonder woman game coming out
[3706.66 → 3712.42] being made by monolith which as other people have pointed out I think is a very good pairing yeah I think that
[3712.42 → 3716.34] makes a lot of sense I think they'll do a perfect job with it yeah so that's cool pretty excited
[3716.34 → 3730.58] about that among us VR could be cool paramount plus is making a halo TV series that apparently looks like
[3730.58 → 3737.62] very high budget so that could be cool or terrible we'll see probably cool I would wager cool and then
[3737.62 → 3747.86] there's Star Wars eclipse which looks really cinematic the trailer that they put out looks really cool
[3751.38 → 3756.58] I mean you saw my tweet earlier this week I'm sure did I I don't know oh it was very funny I said I want
[3756.58 → 3763.62] to fire the Star Wars sequels out of a cannon no oh I did yes get it good get it, so many people didn't get
[3763.62 → 3771.38] it's like I had people correcting my spelling oh and I was like I spelled it with two n's but not
[3771.38 → 3779.38] together c-a-n-o-n yeah I was about to say one n, but there 's's two yeah um oh man so part of
[3779.38 → 3785.86] the problem behind this uh is not just that Star Wars has been a very up and down thing for a long time
[3785.86 → 3793.06] uh mostly down it's also that it's made by the French studio that's behind heavy rain and Detroit become human
[3793.06 → 3799.06] uh there it's listed in the dock as a minor controversy I don't know how minor it is I think
[3799.06 → 3805.70] it's more on the major side of things um, but they were on the the the cancel train a couple of years ago
[3806.26 → 3811.06] right and as far as I know they're it's kind of still the same crew, and now they're making a star
[3811.06 → 3815.70] wars game which is actually kind of interesting because usually Disney is very you know
[3817.78 → 3821.86] they kind of try to keep their hands clean in regard to controversy stuff when they work with
[3821.86 → 3825.94] other companies they've had a lot of controversy yeahs I was going to say there's a lot of evil there
[3825.94 → 3830.66] boy are they ever bad at it than yeah okay but usually when they try to work with other companies
[3830.66 → 3839.54] they're like no you have to be squeaky clean right so oh uh one moment please you have to go uh sorry
[3839.54 → 3844.98] what's that oh um uh give me 15.
[3844.98 → 3856.26] okay bye my wife is leaving without me, I can do it oh no it's okay I'll just do it okay whatever you
[3856.26 → 3862.50] want it's fine it's completely the opposite direction doesn't make sense all right let's do some anyway
[3862.50 → 3866.98] they said some I don't know all the details behind it because I heard about this literally today
[3866.98 → 3871.06] but apparently in the past they said some like homophobic stuff and stuff if you're interested you can look
[3871.06 → 3876.10] into it their name is quantic dream that's the developers behind Star Wars eclipse got it all
[3876.10 → 3882.42] right super chance yeah I mean think you mean merch messages all right super messages
[3882.42 → 3887.14] justice says howdy from ladder what would be the best way to contact you in regard to maybe touring
[3887.14 → 3894.02] the neat building I work in uh you're going to want to try the um you're going to want to try the just
[3894.02 → 3900.90] the publicly listed email it does get monitored not by me, but it does peter h ask wife swap style
[3900.90 → 3908.42] LTT host swap series win also more gift cards for the Ltd backpack and screwdriver when they launch
[3908.42 → 3915.86] Peter's buying cards I have no idea we were talking about wife swap on the pre-show uh where
[3915.86 → 3921.86] I was joking that such a thing haha probably exists, and it turns out not only does it exist it ran for
[3921.86 → 3928.42] like seven seasons and there were like spin-offs and there were yeahs there are similar clone shows and
[3928.42 → 3933.62] in different regions and stuff like that um max asks when is Luke going to host tech linked yeah you
[3933.62 → 3940.18] should totally host tech link you should ask Riley for a chance to host tech link sure out frost Ltd's
[3940.18 → 3945.46] expanding a lot would you consider reviewing mice like build quality or more home server stuff like
[3945.46 → 3951.14] has and nix like stability of after market ones also would love to see Linux compatibility on more
[3951.14 → 3956.10] reviews I think Linux compatibility in particular is something that we would like to expand our testing to
[3956.10 → 3963.70] include the one issue with that is that it goes up and down right that's fair but if it's in a fully
[3963.70 → 3968.82] working state at one point it probably won't be that far from it in the future so yeah that's that's
[3968.82 → 3975.86] at least reasonable to you know think okay let's go ahead and get rid of this one uh Nicholas says not
[3975.86 → 3980.58] an expert here should a reasonably nerdy person calibrate their monitors and TVs or is it only for content
[3980.58 → 3990.02] creation frankly um if all I'm doing is consuming then all that matters is how it looks to me personally
[3990.02 → 3998.66] I like to run my displays at in like a colour accurate mode but I do not actually prefer a warm
[3998.66 → 4004.50] colour temperature which tends to be the most colour accurate way of displaying it so i I tend to go for
[4004.50 → 4011.22] like a calibrated or a neutral type profile and then a neutral uh colour temperature rather than a
[4011.22 → 4015.86] warmer colour temperature and that's my personal preference, and it is totally up to you what your
[4015.86 → 4021.14] personal preference is for consumption but when it comes to creation obviously it's important that it's
[4021.14 → 4027.30] all created to a calibrated standard so that when everybody else has their own preferences they're not
[4027.30 → 4032.58] stacking their preferences on top of your preferences causing all kinds of problems
[4032.58 → 4040.58] Andrew asks t-powered gaming pc when we really do need to do that it is on the list I'd love to
[4040.58 → 4047.30] build something for the spiffing Brit enjoy your new mouse pad Andrew ignition night I've accidentally
[4047.30 → 4053.30] played overcooked with my wife do you think if we play it takes two it can save the marriage I mean
[4053.30 → 4066.98] yes, yes that it is the character that's the super annoying book character yeah yeah oh man uh Jake says
[4066.98 → 4073.38] for your TV just use the ratings guide for a LTT themed blanket they are thinking about it oh yeah
[4073.38 → 4077.78] yep we're definitely thinking about it Sebastian just finished my fall semester in electrical engineering your
[4077.78 → 4081.38] videos were the only reason I pursued the field three more semesters ago hey keep up the good work
[4081.38 → 4087.54] Sebastian love it Christopher thanks for the quality content just built my first pc at 20. We'll be
[4087.54 → 4094.42] using it for my coffee roasting business control delete coffee roasters hey very nice enjoy ELI are
[4094.42 → 4102.34] you guys going to talk about the log 4j2 race exploit yeah but like is that the is that the minecraft thing
[4102.34 → 4106.58] yeah I think yeah, yeah sorry we just didn't we don't know enough about a little bit too tight to the
[4106.58 → 4112.26] show yeah yeah i was doing some stuff today definitely doing some stuff we finally got a smoke
[4112.26 → 4119.62] machine we ran into the weirdest edge case man we had a mesh version and a solid front panel version
[4119.62 → 4127.86] of the same case, and we loaded up the mesh version with like extra Noctua fans and the GPU temps were
[4127.86 → 4134.82] actually nearly identical to the solid front panel version with just like one stock fan in it weird yeah so
[4134.82 → 4141.86] it turns out that there's a lot more to optimized case flow case air flow than just making sure your
[4141.86 → 4146.34] case is mesh making sure it has holes it's going to be a good video so we got a smoke machine to kind of
[4146.34 → 4150.90] demonstrate what was happening in this case so that we can that's cool talk through that nice it's
[4150.90 → 4158.98] a lot of fun Tamás I'd love if l2d would cover more augmented reality news and products hey for sure but
[4158.98 → 4170.18] unfortunately you and dozens of other people all dozens it just the content does not perform well
[4170.74 → 4178.98] I'll say this there's a really cool HoloLens segment in the videos that I was working on uh overseas oh i
[4178.98 → 4184.98] think I'm allowed to say it was with intel at this point oh well it's a whole thing where there was going
[4184.98 → 4190.10] to be another event and I wasn't really supposed to talk about that I was there until after the other
[4190.10 → 4196.90] event was like okay announced but then is surreal closed their borders like immediately after I left
[4196.90 → 4205.14] so the other event is actually cancelled happening so um yeah so I think it doesn't matter anymore anyway
[4205.14 → 4210.82] those videos are coming soon uh Joshua asks do you have any plans for express shipping on Ltd stores right
[4210.82 → 4216.18] now it takes almost a month for orders to ship to India you would be horrified to see how much it
[4216.18 → 4222.98] would cost for express shipping we are far better off focusing on getting our volumes up as high as we
[4222.98 → 4229.14] can with the shipping provider that we have so that our rates can be as good as they can be yes it's going
[4229.14 → 4235.70] to take time sometimes we're sorry, but that's the way that it's going to be for now if you want to like buy
[4235.70 → 4240.82] a plane ticket for your shirt Johanna's asked basically the same question uh Robert Christmas
[4240.82 → 4245.94] bonus time make sure the Ltd backpack has a thick pad of foam on the bottom I wouldn't describe it as
[4245.94 → 4252.74] super thick but what it is its construction it's constructed in such a way that it actually
[4252.74 → 4260.18] kind of tapers at the bottom of the pocket so that helps to keep it from falling down so fast neat right
[4260.18 → 4269.54] uh let's do that Simon how has Ltd prepared the office for earthquakes and other potential
[4269.54 → 4276.58] natural disasters um so because we do live in an earthquake zone we have pretty stringent um earthquake
[4276.58 → 4281.94] proofless requirements in our building code other than that we haven't really done anything else other
[4281.94 → 4286.02] than just do what we're supposed to be doing which is like you know bolt down shelves and stuff a lot
[4286.02 → 4293.70] of it's just baked into the building code yep uh wise I'm planning to make an unpaid VR VM
[4293.70 → 4299.30] slash NAS setup should I go intel or AMD which is going to give me the fewest issues I might go
[4299.30 → 4306.26] thunderbolt for Io might even mind while the GPU is idle I know I need a motherboard with good Tommy
[4306.26 → 4318.42] man that is an extremely um sketchy configuration the odds of having that working like daily driver
[4318.98 → 4327.54] perfect pretty slim if you can find someone else who has built basically exactly the same thing and
[4327.54 → 4336.02] has it working perfectly, and you can just clone their config great, but that ain't that ain't a good
[4336.02 → 4343.38] that your chances they suck big time Kenneth is saying that apparently uh when they remove the
[4343.38 → 4348.18] dislike button they're also increasing ads on the site which I find pretty interesting uh I didn't
[4348.18 → 4354.34] know that part oh really uh, and also he's saying uh if you guys are hiring accountants in a couple of years
[4354.90 → 4360.82] when I'm done with my degree we probably will be we need accountant applicants now actually yeah now is
[4360.82 → 4365.30] the time we need accountant applicants I mean you know in a couple of years feel free to reach out maybe we
[4365.30 → 4372.02] won't have found anyone yet, but we'll see we need yeah apply now do it go Rafael says work for a pc
[4372.02 → 4377.06] retailer assembling pre-built the past week has been an actual nightmare with at least 50 Asus prime
[4377.06 → 4381.70] motherboards just dying for no apparent reason which now have to be returned after we already built most
[4381.70 → 4387.62] of them oh rough week, but you treated yourself to a neon hard drive t-shirt and an insulated water bottle
[4387.62 → 4392.66] hope you enjoy it nice Phil hey guys love you both equally the purchase is a gift for a friend mystery
[4392.66 → 4399.54] water bottle and northern lights' desk pad love is nice his name is race after race Bannon wow from
[4399.54 → 4413.38] johnny quest his name is race wow race Bannon I love it all right cool Braden say soled awesome burning not
[4413.38 → 4421.38] awesome micro lead perfect middle ground for a pc question mark all right here's the problem with micro lead
[4421.38 → 4429.70] the problem with micro lead just because a LED is not organic doesn't mean that it won't eventually
[4429.70 → 4438.66] burn out in fact that characteristic I think i kind of i kind of bought into the narrative of you
[4438.66 → 4446.82] know oh well they they they fade because they're organic well they that's a reason that they fade but LEDs
[4446.82 → 4456.50] can fade for lots of different reasons and normal led scan also fade so what I heard back when I was
[4456.50 → 4465.06] considering the wall from an installer is that it is extremely common for the panels to fade unevenly
[4465.06 → 4470.02] which is essentially burn in and extremely common for the cabinets to fail
[4470.02 → 4479.30] so I was looking at this very expensive like what was it like a quarter million dollar TV or whatever
[4479.30 → 4485.06] it's going to be huge knowing that I was going to have like what was it 16 cabinets or something like
[4485.06 → 4491.62] that and that the odds by the time you have 16 of them installed of one of them failing in a relatively
[4491.62 → 4497.62] short period of time was like very good i just kind of was sitting there going no I don't think
[4498.18 → 4504.82] I don't think this makes any sense um now that's not to say that micro led won't get better it very
[4504.82 → 4511.94] likely will but if I was going to be excited about anything it would probably be what jams's video
[4511.94 → 4518.10] which is coming probably sometime in the next week or two is about and I don't know if I'm allowed to
[4518.10 → 4522.02] say what it is yet I think there might be some embargoes involved but man
[4522.02 → 4532.26] pretty cool uh if you want some hints as to what the future of TVs might be you can go watch the
[4533.06 → 4538.34] uh the video that jams also wrote future of TVs I think is what it was called
[4539.94 → 4550.58] uh the future of TVs is not what you think was a video we released about a year ago that jams wrote that should give you some idea of some of the really cool stuff that is coming down the pipe over the next few years
[4550.58 → 4552.50] over the next few years thank you john g
[4555.62 → 4561.30] chosen 477 I'm finally able to buy your merch I was expecting free shipping inside Canada though
[4561.30 → 4568.58] yeah so same thing um we basically have one big bucket that everyone who orders pays into and then
[4568.58 → 4574.98] we use that to pay our shipping provider, and we actually lose about 10 on it so we're not we're not
[4574.98 → 4582.34] like gouging we're just trying to make the merch accessible to everyone and that's not the best for
[4582.34 → 4591.30] the people for whom the shipping might have been cheaper but um hooray, hooray Canadian socialism or something
[4591.86 → 4597.70] yeah yeah that's what the essence store is for um
[4597.70 → 4608.10] yeah no it's for store it's LTT store it's not just s no the whole thing's an acronym um yeah moving
[4608.10 → 4614.10] on I guess the 2005 water cooling video reminded me that the first time I saw Linus he was doing
[4614.10 → 4622.18] maintenance on a custom loop uh with what I say oh yep the Silverstone tj11 nice it's been a minute
[4622.18 → 4631.62] good old Silverstone tj11 man Silverstone they have had some good ship over the years tj11 man was
[4631.62 → 4637.54] that back when uh what's their face maximum pc used to do their like dream pc builds and all that good
[4637.54 → 4645.62] stuff those were so cool tj11 I love that Silverstone archives all their cases on their site why doesn't
[4645.62 → 4651.70] every manufacturer do that why do they just remove all reference to their old products as though they
[4651.70 → 4658.34] never existed its kind of weird like um uh there 's's uh there was a creator who was trying to
[4658.34 → 4664.50] create like a digital museum of apple's marketing over the years because they will just
[4665.14 → 4671.70] expunge it when they're done with it uh, and he was like, but this is sort of really important you know
[4671.70 → 4678.66] historical design and stuff yeah there's a lot that goes into marketing there's a lot that goes
[4678.66 → 4684.26] into it, and he was like this is historically really important and uh so he had it all archived
[4684.26 → 4690.10] somewhere, and they were basically like cease and desist you may not you may not display this is
[4690.10 → 4696.02] our copyrighted material they're not wrong it's just lame but I mean I guess they can't, they can't put
[4696.02 → 4701.22] it all in a table book for 250 dollars if it's freely available on the internet right I mean, but that's
[4701.22 → 4706.10] the irony right is that they did it anyway and people bought the book anyway so clearly it didn't
[4706.10 → 4715.38] matter apparently the tj11 is still on sale are you serious I was gonna kind of ask like has Silverstone
[4715.38 → 4721.30] stone done a lot lately yeah I know they really pushed to increase skew counts I'm sure they're still
[4721.30 → 4728.10] doing that but like believe it or not Silverstone has a case coming that we have a video coming about
[4728.10 → 4732.90] that is flipping amazing cool you know what why don't you do a couple more merch messages I'll go
[4732.90 → 4737.46] grab it I think it's over there sweet thoughts on the flow x13 well that's a question for me
[4738.58 → 4745.54] um I know the flow x13 I'm surprised you didn't love it the one issue I have with it is it kind of
[4745.54 → 4752.98] feels like the display is either I don't know it's like low contrast or it has readability issues from
[4752.98 → 4759.94] from a distance um that's the only issue I had with it the battery life is just awesome for something
[4759.94 → 4767.06] with a dedicated GPU in it the performance is great um I used it on my trip to Tel Aviv
[4767.06 → 4773.30] and I thought it was awesome gaming with it on the go yeah I know I still love it I've got I've got two
[4774.10 → 4778.10] oh no the Silverstone machine has been moved they cleaned the set okay I'm going to have to look for
[4778.10 → 4784.74] it elsewhere all right baby all right uh Dennis says watching your content since 2015 and still
[4784.74 → 4790.18] loving it convinced my friend to buy some sweet merch with me so take some of our first income
[4790.18 → 4799.06] nice heck yeah I appreciate well not me, but we appreciate your first income steam link finally died
[4799.06 → 4805.46] that actually sucks those were pretty cool is a 200 shield pro really the best alternative right now
[4805.46 → 4811.06] for couch pc streaming left my old water bottle on the bus so finally getting a replacement I think a
[4811.06 → 4817.14] lot of that depends on how far away the computer is how realistic it is to run cables through walls
[4817.14 → 4824.34] things like that um I don't think I'm up on streaming to the TV technology right now I know
[4824.34 → 4830.26] shields have done it very well in the past um but if you could do it with a wire it's pretty good
[4830.26 → 4838.98] how much are 20 ounces in real units google's really, really good at that I'm sorry I'm not
[4838.98 → 4844.50] trying to be sassy i just I have no idea and google for sure knows, and they google actually has I don't
[4844.50 → 4849.22] know if you guys know this it has built-in calculator things for equations like that so it will do it
[4849.22 → 4856.58] for sure and well good to see desk pad measurements are in metric it has both actually um could we will okay
[4856.58 → 4863.22] uh I think the desk pad measurements might be in metric I think you're right the desk pad configurator
[4863.22 → 4869.22] which is not out yet has both um could we get another Terran macro guide but this time for Linus
[4870.66 → 4877.70] no I don't I don't I'll be honest with you, I don't really use macros um I don't video edit so that's
[4877.70 → 4883.86] that's the reason why I tilted my head I was like wow yeah I just would, you even use it for I have a
[4883.86 → 4892.42] confession back in my younger days I had macros for some of my most commonly used passwords
[4896.90 → 4904.34] like I'm talking back like OG g15 days oh um because I mean password managers like we have them
[4904.34 → 4910.02] now weren't a thing did you have done you have one set up for your windows' password uh no okay I think the
[4910.02 → 4915.46] Logitech driver didn't load like pre-login or whatever back then not that you couldn't just
[4915.46 → 4921.30] extremely easily bypass windows passwords back yeah so whatever um Alex says my steam link
[4921.30 → 4926.34] finally died is a 200 shield pro really the best alternative right now for couch pc streaming yeah
[4926.34 → 4932.74] kind of, and it does a lot of other stuff well as well um i I said it's perfect try to run a cable
[4932.74 → 4937.38] if you can oh, oh have you gone through these but not archived them uh all of them except for that one
[4937.38 → 4944.18] oh no and this one I pressed that what Lt t-shirt does Luke have on I want it that's elemental baby
[4944.18 → 4949.86] that was our biggest product flop ever yeah, but then we turned it into a success by selling it for
[4949.86 → 4957.94] cheap and get this we're bringing it back for a third time we're ready to flop even harder than before
[4960.02 → 4964.66] why because are you guys having a hard time getting shirts in general why wouldn't you use it for
[4964.66 → 4969.78] different we can get black ones oh okay yeah so we can get enough black ones that we can do
[4969.78 → 4976.90] another elemental so uh basically the way elemental seems to kind of work now is we take the two top
[4976.90 → 4983.86] selling designs from the last failure or like the least bad ones we continue those we do two more
[4984.74 → 4990.82] and then rinse and repeat so that's what we're doing again we're taking the two best of the worst from
[4990.82 → 4997.22] last time and then Lloyd has done up two more new colours, so there are now a total of eight
[4997.22 → 5003.70] elemental designs over three generations once the new ones launch, and they too can be yours for
[5004.98 → 5010.82] I don't know you could buy them for full price but just wait if you hold out we just might discount
[5010.82 → 5017.38] them sorry I had something I had something stuck behind there like it's such a stupid product because we
[5017.38 → 5023.62] don't make any money on it, but it seems to actually generate a shocking amount of hype and there are
[5023.62 → 5029.38] people who actually do like it so that's cool I think they're fine I don't think they're necessarily
[5029.38 → 5033.38] as cool as some of the other options which is why I think they might not sell that well I don't think
[5033.38 → 5040.34] it's a bad shirt um I just think there's a lot of other like potentially cooler ones, and you see we are
[5040.34 → 5045.86] going to be getting more wan hoodies as soon as we can as soon as we can, I don't want to promise
[5045.86 → 5051.06] anything because worldwide logistics is so screwed up right now that if I promise something I'm
[5051.06 → 5058.82] basically setting myself up to be a big liar thanks comic this purchase is sponsored by my birthday oh
[5058.82 → 5064.74] okay hey Linus and Luke picking up a new lanyard for my badge as I just started a new it jobs a month ago
[5064.74 → 5068.90] I've been watching since 2012 and knew nothing about tech beforehand now I'm starting a career
[5068.90 → 5075.70] heck yeah Brian cool David w hi from the UK been watching since the house just turned 18 a few weeks
[5075.70 → 5080.98] back are there plans for a Wi-Fi mesh comparison video I would love to do it, but we don't really
[5080.98 → 5087.78] have a suitable test platform for it right now what we need is a relatively RF clean environment
[5088.82 → 5093.94] so that we can isolate our variables, and it's just not something that we have available to us at the
[5093.94 → 5099.30] moment kind of need both because you want to test it out in a messy environment too anyway yeah I'm sure
[5100.42 → 5104.10] greetings from Serbia been with you since the beloved kitchen and that one disappeared
[5104.10 → 5109.14] um no it's just down one Christopher says love the new party show oh okay yeah no never mind we'll

[5113.86 → 5119.86] we had just pushed to the thing that's okay here's something for the Linux challenge stupid stuff windows
[5119.86 → 5124.66] does addition step one use the Xbox app to install a few games to a secondary drive step two do a fresh
[5124.66 → 5131.46] install step three enjoy inaccessible undelectable folders I believe you man I had to get the new minecraft
[5131.46 → 5138.90] launcher for my kids, and it was a mess like the one in the Xbox store or whatever just total mess the
[5138.90 → 5145.46] old java edition launcher was just perfect for both minecraft and dungeons was fine i I haven't I haven't
[5145.46 → 5152.82] tried it but I have heard if you get halo through steam you get the cross-platform play thing so you
[5152.82 → 5159.86] you can play it on Xbox, but your save doesn't transfer it only transfers if you bought it through the windows
[5159.86 → 5169.22] store which is just like why okay it's not even like that big of a deal because I don't know that
[5169.22 → 5176.34] many people that are going to play a single player game on both but like some people will Alex f slowly

[5194.26 → 5199.38] hey you're welcome glad your boyfriend will enjoy it hey we got a couple of these, and we've got
[5199.38 → 5205.38] two more after Anthony's latest MacBook Pro m1 max review for creative purposes would you still prefer
[5205.38 → 5209.70] macBook seeing that it falls short of the 3060 mobile and all tests except video editing really the
[5209.70 → 5214.66] answer is what software are you running because if the software that you're running needs a mac
[5214.66 → 5225.14] mac then buy a mac and if it doesn't then don't buy a mac that was like uh when my mom was
[5225.14 → 5231.86] working on movies and TV shows and stuff yep a lot of sets kinds of required iOS devices because they
[5231.86 → 5239.30] used things like airdrop or whatever else and there was like a mild debate starting about like whether
[5239.30 → 5245.38] or not she should get an iOS device she's never used one before and the conclusion which we probably
[5245.38 → 5251.22] should have gotten to a little bit faster, but we did get to was like it doesn't matter she has to
[5251.22 → 5256.66] get one so like yeah let's just get it and then try to learn it, and luckily she adapted to it really
[5256.66 → 5261.62] fast and everything was fine but Alexis I want to buy your water bottle, but it's metal and that usually
[5261.62 → 5267.14] makes my water taste metallic does that happen with your bottles so they end up with a bit of like
[5267.14 → 5273.22] manufacturing stank taste for I'd say probably somewhere between the first five and 15 washes
[5273.22 → 5278.74] like I'm pretty sensitive to it so I'll take a new bottle and I'll just sit and I will wash it like
[5278.74 → 5284.10] five or ten times but after that no I do not detect any metallic taste and if you go on the site
[5284.74 → 5293.30] we do not censor our reviews I hate it when companies do this every review aside from ones that are spam
[5293.30 → 5300.10] every review stays on the site so if you go through the 471 reviews I actually remember reading one
[5300.10 → 5305.94] that mentioned metallic tastes like yesterday or today or something like that you can see we actually
[5305.94 → 5312.50] get so many reviews on the site that all of these are from today these five if we go on to the next page
[5312.50 → 5319.86] all of these are from today yeah we remove ones that are clearly spam or are clearly inappropriate
[5319.86 → 5330.10] um there are ones that have had like lots of wording in it that is like not appropriate for a tech review
[5330.58 → 5337.86] um so that's a thing had nothing to do with like the actual product etc those are the only things that
[5337.86 → 5345.54] would be removed oh you know what I think uh I think the review I saw was on the mystery bottle
[5345.54 → 5352.02] mystery bottle this one doesn't have as many reviews either because well it's got a lot
[5352.02 → 5357.94] Jake is holding the case hostage does he have it he has it oh, oh yeah I couldn't find it where is it
[5357.94 → 5362.98] I think he hid it from you oh speaking of which Jake is coming over for uh for gaming tonight do you
[5362.98 → 5368.98] want to come too yeah okay cool so why don't we just all head to my house after yeah nice okay here it is
[5368.98 → 5375.22] from Evan Jensen perfect doesn't have metallic aftertaste boom you heard it from Evan first my
[5375.22 → 5380.02] the biggest gripe with reusable water bottles is that most give the water metallic taste these do not have
[5380.02 → 5387.22] that problem hey there you go confirmed, and we've apparently got some gaming to do now so we will see
[5387.22 → 5393.22] you all later thanks hi b with this shirt I will always wear it with Linus and Luke in my heat sinking

[5433.06 → 5439.38] rumours of a LG 97 inch 4k OLED in 2022 cause you to rethink your home theatre choices
[5440.98 → 5446.90] 97 inch OLED it's pretty big that's pretty big that's pretty big I think I want to go projector
[5446.90 → 5451.54] though I think we're we've got light control in the room now I think we're going 130-inch projector
