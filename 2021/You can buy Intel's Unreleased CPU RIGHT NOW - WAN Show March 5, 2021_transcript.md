[0.00 --> 9.80]  and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you today
[9.80 --> 17.92]  a non-tech has published an early full review of intel's upcoming rocket lake 10 excuse me 10
[17.92 --> 26.98]  old habit excuse me 11 700k processor in advance of the review embargo how did they do this they
[26.98 --> 33.94]  went to the store and bought one fascinating in other news we are going to be letting you guys
[33.94 --> 39.88]  know how the verified actual gamer program will be working i posted on twitter a little while ago
[39.88 --> 48.82]  that we have a palette worth of rtx 3080s ready to rock ready to put in the hands of verified actual
[48.82 --> 55.14]  gamers for their msrp with no scalper markups and we are going to be giving you guys the full skinny
[55.14 --> 62.14]  on that whole program because let me put it this way it is more than what i already showed you in
[62.14 --> 70.84]  the tweet uh-huh uh-huh what do you got luke i will be trying to make sure that linus doesn't leak
[70.84 --> 79.34]  unnecessary information about the verified actual gamer program good luck also also uh google is a
[79.34 --> 84.10]  privacy company now there's some weird stuff going on there back in 2019 they made some announcements
[84.10 --> 90.70]  and now they're doing things about it and it just feels weird and strange and odd uh also there is
[90.70 --> 99.04]  an arizona house uh bill requiring allowance for third-party payments on app platforms interesting
[99.04 --> 105.84]  fascinating even with all that lobbying probably won't go through that but we'll see let's roll that
[105.84 --> 110.08]  oh it passed what okay yeah we'll talk about that more later
[110.08 --> 116.44]  oh is there no audio oh yeah there is
[116.44 --> 135.28]  all right so why don't we jump right into the headline topic hold on hold on oh i well i wanted
[135.28 --> 143.50]  to tell them about the headline topic luke hold on i will hold on i feel robbed what what did i do
[143.50 --> 152.32]  where's the new intro i know i know i just i forgot i forgot and you forgot is it made i i'd have no
[152.32 --> 159.62]  idea i didn't even ask i'm sorry okay no new intro this week next week next week all right
[159.62 --> 169.98]  anantec has published their full review of the intel core i7 11 700k nearly two weeks early
[169.98 --> 176.62]  like it's one thing if they get an engineering sample like tom's hardware always used to do and
[176.62 --> 183.72]  it's like oh yeah well we've got some numbers but they aren't final no final but this is final hardware
[183.72 --> 192.34]  how'd they get it they bought it from a european retailer for the equivalent of 469 us dollars nice
[192.34 --> 198.48]  nice nice one quick thing before you keep going uh sponsors sponsor announcements uh sponsor
[198.48 --> 203.14]  announcements i don't think you did that at the end of the intro oh uh oh yes our sponsors for the
[203.14 --> 214.10]  show today are i'm not sure ah yes redux ridge wallet and squarespace okay so here's how this works
[214.10 --> 224.66]  normally a publication like a non-tech like us would have an nda with intel that would prevent them
[224.66 --> 231.58]  from publishing a review of a product that has is not yet released that has not yet uh had the embargo
[231.58 --> 239.98]  lifted on it but the way that an nda works is if you can demonstrate that the information did not
[239.98 --> 248.14]  originate from you that it was already out in the wild the nda is thereby deemed null and void so for
[248.14 --> 255.46]  example if i were to make luke sign an nda that he can never tell the world that my eyes are actually
[255.46 --> 263.96]  green for example and i wear brown contacts because i don't want anyone to know yeah that'd be bad
[263.96 --> 271.04]  then if luke broke that news i could sue him for whatever kinds of damages i feel i'm entitled to
[271.04 --> 276.80]  because of you know the fact that you guys found out oh good heavens i have green eyes or whatever
[276.80 --> 285.38]  the case may be but if some you know paparazzo or whatever what's the singular form of paparazzi
[285.38 --> 290.88]  i i can't remember if some paparazzi not single singular is it not one of those words that they
[290.88 --> 296.38]  like it's singular and plural i'm not sure the point is if some rogue photographer managed to
[296.38 --> 303.28]  catch me before i got up and put myself together in the morning with green eyes and posted on reddit
[303.28 --> 311.24]  and luke were to say yeah he's got green eyes i would say hey luke because you could have at least
[311.24 --> 317.22]  like helped me keep this under wraps but i would have no legal recourse because that information was
[317.22 --> 326.92]  already out there all luke did was kind of shrug and go yeah and so he hasn't actually broken the
[326.92 --> 335.84]  nda he just isn't helping to keep it anymore because it's disclosed anyways yeah yeah it's already it's
[335.84 --> 342.54]  already public knowledge so by the way you were correct it's paparazzo oh nice so luke are excuse me
[342.54 --> 350.70]  so anantec yeah they might have a signed nda with intel but there's absolutely nothing intel can do
[350.70 --> 357.68]  when it comes to a product that anantec goes and buys because the deal with an embargo with an nda is
[357.68 --> 366.80]  we provide you chip you give unbiased review so if we never provide you chip and you decide you give
[366.80 --> 372.60]  unbiased review all the other terms of the agreement are basically unenforceable in fact
[372.60 --> 379.06]  this is kind of crazy they actually notified intel that they had the processor this is a quote from the
[379.06 --> 386.76]  review our and this is great they said they have it and uh-huh the response this is really weird
[386.76 --> 395.22]  our email to intel seemingly generated some excitement inside and to our surprise outside of intel
[395.22 --> 400.20]  but we received a response from intel stating that they had no comment to offer
[400.20 --> 409.60]  regarding rumors about early retail availability intel told anantec we take our embargo agreement
[409.60 --> 420.14]  seriously and are following up as appropriate well um let me give you a little clue intel 11 700k
[420.14 --> 425.20]  okay bye hold on let's do a little display capture here let's see if maybe we can find this
[425.20 --> 433.98]  this rogue this rogue processor i guess we're gonna try real hard let's see let's see where to buy
[433.98 --> 446.60]  okay we don't know oh we don't know where to buy it wow that's a lot of ads amazon new egg scan
[446.60 --> 453.76]  overclockers okay well they don't know they don't know the news okay let's keep going here we go oh
[453.76 --> 464.32]  second link let's try again if but oh the price might shock you what a headline thank you tech radar
[464.32 --> 471.12]  it's still up at the time of writing wow that was really hard intel is sure doing an amazing
[471.12 --> 479.92]  super awesome good job of following this up and making sure that mindfactory.de does not sell any
[479.92 --> 486.30]  more of these core i7 11 700ks you know what the craziest part of this is luke
[486.30 --> 497.56]  mindfactory.de actually lists right on the product how many they've sold so you can actually see they
[497.56 --> 506.04]  are a pretty small time seller they sold 5600 10 700ks over the entire lifetime of the product
[506.04 --> 513.34]  and even though this is an early product that i would think with all the shortages on cpus right
[513.34 --> 519.28]  now gamers would be pretty eager to get their hands on they've sold over 240
[519.28 --> 531.12]  240 well that was sure worth it 240 whole whole cpus to all in the interest of or like what i mean at
[531.12 --> 539.64]  what cost right all you did was like off every other retailer on the planet and probably intel and
[539.64 --> 547.48]  definitely me because i'm pretty annoyed i mean yeah that makes sense like it's supposed to be that
[547.48 --> 553.86]  you compete with other media outlets on the merit of your coverage right but when it's like this
[553.86 --> 561.24]  all of a sudden it's just like a mad grab for who has the best back alley contacts to source the product
[561.24 --> 569.20]  uh earlier right like it the whole idea behind being a reviewer and having this is a dirty move
[569.20 --> 578.70]  for a reviewer to do um if if joe and bob's computer shop down the street yeah had one for some reason
[578.70 --> 582.18]  would you buy it and do a review or no
[582.18 --> 597.28]  yeah i'd do it yep yep so any any anger that i have is going to be directed towards the
[597.28 --> 603.80]  inadequacy of intel systems to prevent something like this from happening because everybody knows
[603.80 --> 612.76]  the second the product is in the hands of our retail partner it's out it's out if you don't do
[612.76 --> 618.86]  it if an ant tech doesn't do it if if someone else doesn't do it there's going to be another person in
[618.86 --> 623.12]  line that is going to do it exactly it's going to happen or a review is going to come out it's going
[623.12 --> 627.64]  to be leaked if it's if it's in re if it's on a retail shelf and you can buy it it's out that's
[627.64 --> 635.30]  the whole reason that trusted partners who abide by embargoes are supposed to have the product
[635.30 --> 641.92]  like two weeks at three weeks ahead of time so that as long as we're on the ball and we're working
[641.92 --> 648.32]  on the thing right away if something like this were to happen and some retailer goes early we at least
[648.32 --> 655.84]  have the flexibility to make a move like we can call up intel be like okay look um clearly this
[655.84 --> 661.96]  embargo is is dead it's dead as a doornail so we need to go live with this thing before all the
[661.96 --> 669.72]  you know joes on forums are posting about it and people are confused and don't know what kind of
[669.72 --> 675.48]  performance they're supposed to expect there's no there's no reviews um like we need to just go for
[675.48 --> 680.84]  it and i mean we had something like this happen actually with the 8k gaming experience that we did
[680.84 --> 688.86]  with the rtx 3090 uh there was some kind of something happened uh i have some ideas exactly what happened
[688.86 --> 697.82]  but um there was a certain order that those videos were supposed to go up and that didn't happen
[697.82 --> 703.88]  and so fortunately because we were on the ball we had access to the product early we had
[703.88 --> 711.44]  our video ready to go and we were able to click publish right away because it was ready so right
[711.44 --> 718.06]  now i mean i don't know it's a funny thing because like i'm technically still under nda for the 11 700k
[718.06 --> 724.50]  which means not only can i not comment on the performance and the price and i mean you can see
[724.50 --> 730.50]  the price is right there but i couldn't comment on a canadian or american price which is how i typically
[730.50 --> 736.30]  get pricing so i can't comment on the price um i you can comment on the performance can't you
[736.30 --> 743.00]  um i guess i could now because it's in their article except okay so here's where we get into a bit of the
[743.00 --> 749.44]  nuance so one of the things that i can't comment on is any terms of the nda that have not been disclosed
[749.44 --> 757.06]  so for example if there was a particular uh embargo lift time that intel hadn't disclosed i wouldn't even be
[757.06 --> 764.16]  able to tell you when i will be able to tell you another thing is that because we are going to be
[764.16 --> 770.40]  getting a chip from intel and using that for our benchmarking i actually cannot publish my own
[770.40 --> 776.42]  benchmarks so i could tell you a non-text numbers i could just repeat those i could make a video about
[776.42 --> 782.44]  it because that's out there but if we do our own measurements and we do our own analysis
[782.44 --> 792.32]  analysis that is now our data and we could well we would we would be restricted in terms of what we
[792.32 --> 798.98]  can tell you by the terms of our nda so at risk of breaking my nda because i feel like this is
[798.98 --> 805.38]  information that you know can't really hurt anyone too much i don't even have one yet so
[805.38 --> 814.70]  we are in absolutely no position whatsoever to respond to this because intel went and got product
[814.70 --> 824.32]  out there in distribution to retail partners before even seeding media um or at least us i mean it's
[824.32 --> 830.98]  quite possible that others have it already i know that um der bauer roman often gets stuff early because
[830.98 --> 837.16]  he's involved in things like overclocking validation in addition to being a reviewer for example
[837.16 --> 846.56]  right so i'm pretty annoyed but i'm annoyed mostly with intel not with a non-tech if i was them i'd have
[846.56 --> 852.92]  done the exact same thing i even got a i even got a little message from ian got a got a cute little
[852.92 --> 860.08]  message from dr cutras over here what the heck did he say this guy he's adorable he's adorable
[860.08 --> 867.38]  he's like teehee no he didn't actually write teehee yeah i was like that doesn't really sound like
[867.38 --> 873.90]  he goes got something coming out late you might want to talk about on wanshow just fyi look at this
[873.90 --> 884.30]  guy look at this look at this clout chasing mother okay he knows he knows i can't resist it
[884.30 --> 890.94]  he knows that's why i gotta talk about dr cutras on the show so anyway he sends me a link to the
[890.94 --> 896.18]  article so anthony went through it since it's out there why don't we talk about the numbers from
[896.18 --> 904.18]  dr cutras over at anontech and tektekpotato his youtube channel the chip itself do you want to run
[904.18 --> 909.42]  us through it luke i feel like i've done a lot of talking it's um so because we're going off of their
[909.42 --> 915.48]  numbers uh i i believe this was anthony laid it out this way i think it's actually pretty cool the
[915.48 --> 919.66]  way he laid it out so i'm just going to run through this instead of scraping off of their review i was
[919.66 --> 925.46]  originally looking through their review trying to pull some data points whatever um so it it runs
[925.46 --> 932.76]  real hot we know that much um how does it perform it performs significantly worse
[932.76 --> 941.72]  than the ryzen 7 5800x in 3d particle movement ai benchmarks digi cortex small dwarf fortress worlds
[941.72 --> 951.84]  corona benchmark crisis cpu only v-ray cinebench r20 hand bake a hand break 4k 60 uh all archiving tests
[951.84 --> 959.64]  all javascript web browser tests and spec inch 2017 okay it performs slightly worse wait hold on a second
[959.64 --> 966.12]  i was about to say but we would expect that because it has significantly fewer cores than a 5800x oops no i
[966.12 --> 977.00]  misread that it actually has the same number of cores as a 5800x um it performs slightly worse than that
[977.00 --> 984.12]  same uh processor in the y cruncher multi-thread agisoft photo scan gimp application launch named
[984.12 --> 995.24]  ap o a1 simulation and all gaming tests other than some at uh notably high resolutions um it is on par
[995.24 --> 1003.24]  with said processor in blender mid-sized and large door fortress worlds handbrake 480p discord
[1004.36 --> 1011.56]  and spec 2017 it's essentially there's very few things that it's on par with it there's even fewer
[1011.56 --> 1017.48]  things that are significantly better dwarf fortress okay is that's my favorite best on this list i just
[1017.48 --> 1023.64]  have to say it's best played in medium and large sized worlds okay if you're playing dwarf fortress
[1023.64 --> 1029.72]  can i just say for a second that if you're playing dwarf fortress in a small world then you are you're a
[1029.72 --> 1036.28]  big piece of okay you're not a gamer you're human garbage okay whoa
[1036.28 --> 1045.64]  that's like your measure of man how big your dwarf fortress world is i'm not even actually familiar
[1045.64 --> 1051.00]  with this benchmark i i don't even know exactly what the benchmark is maybe either that's i know
[1051.00 --> 1057.32]  it's my favorite one it's an ancient like text-based game that we used to play on like crappy netbooks so
[1057.32 --> 1064.60]  i don't really understand but i'll uh i'll trust an antec on that one um but yeah it's only slightly
[1064.60 --> 1069.72]  better than that process or significant sorry it's only significantly better than that pro than the
[1069.72 --> 1077.64]  ryzen 7 5800x to be clear in 3d particle movement peak avx by a factor of nearly six which is pretty
[1077.64 --> 1085.88]  wild and y cruncher single threaded okay so it's the single thread king when it comes to calculating pi
[1085.88 --> 1098.68]  i'm not gonna lie i had um i had higher expectations uh based on the scuttlebutt that i had heard in the
[1098.68 --> 1106.52]  industry i was thinking that intel was giving up those two cores because remember this is an eight core
[1106.52 --> 1112.20]  chip that seems to be coming in as a direct replacement for a 10 core chip
[1112.20 --> 1120.12]  which means that i was under the impression that intel would be giving up those two cores
[1120.12 --> 1126.28]  for some very significant single threaded performance gains like i thought they were
[1126.28 --> 1133.48]  going to come back absolutely all guns ablaze and taking the gaming crown like that that that was my
[1133.48 --> 1140.12]  expectation now maybe if i hadn't read any of the rumors and i had thought that this was just going to be
[1140.12 --> 1150.04]  yet another sort of 14 nanometer reheated cpu you know and then and then whoa we ended up with a
[1150.04 --> 1157.24]  floating point performance gain of 19 over 10th gen and integer performance gain of 7 to 13 over 10th gen
[1157.96 --> 1161.88]  i might have been impressed i might have been really happy because i'd be like oh wow i was expecting
[1161.88 --> 1167.40]  basically nothing and i got a lot more than nothing i got a pretty solid generational performance
[1167.40 --> 1173.56]  improvement improvement but i i i don't know i was just expecting i was expecting it to come back
[1173.56 --> 1182.04]  absolutely for people purchasing processors do you think it's going to matter almost at all well no
[1182.04 --> 1188.92]  because and let me get into that so a non-text review has a conclusion here that i think is
[1188.92 --> 1197.40]  is interesting um rocket lake has some regressions in core to core performance and its memory latency
[1197.40 --> 1202.60]  profile so okay so that's what happens when you're making a significant architectural change i suppose
[1202.60 --> 1207.80]  instead of just releasing the same game same game same cpu over and over again in different packages is
[1208.36 --> 1212.20]  you're not talking about ea we're talking about intel yeah yeah we'll gain here we'll lose there thank
[1212.20 --> 1219.64]  you luke that was good i i liked it i i quite enjoyed that um and then they go on to say our
[1219.64 --> 1226.44]  results clearly show that intel's performance while substantial still trails its main competitor amd
[1226.44 --> 1233.00]  in a core for core comparison intel is slightly slower and a lot more inefficient the smart money would
[1233.00 --> 1242.12]  be to get the amd processor except that i think that dr cutris may have overlooked something let's go ahead
[1242.12 --> 1251.08]  and revisit my screen for a moment here shall we this right here is a core i7 1100k and i don't actually
[1251.08 --> 1256.20]  know what the us pricing is going to be because anthony's the one who sits on the intel briefings now not me
[1256.20 --> 1263.32]  so it's possible he knows but i don't but what i do know is that typically the way that pricing works from
[1263.32 --> 1269.32]  region to region it region to region excuse me is that europe gets absolutely on
[1269.32 --> 1274.76]  because even though their currency is worth a lot more than ours it tends to be pretty dangerously
[1274.76 --> 1280.84]  close to a one-to-one exchange rate in terms of product pricing so i think it's fairly safe to say
[1280.84 --> 1290.28]  then that a core i7 11 700k is going to cost less than 500 in the good old us and a so let's go ahead
[1290.28 --> 1301.24]  and try to buy a 5800x shall we hmm i don't think you read the rest of the conclusion me yeah oh
[1302.36 --> 1308.92]  well hit me with that so he goes on to say the smart money would like you said however due to high
[1308.92 --> 1313.32]  demand and prioritizing commercial and enterprise contracts the only parts readily available on retail
[1313.32 --> 1318.68]  shelves right now are from intel normally this is where i would conclude with a comment on what to recommend
[1318.68 --> 1323.88]  but the clear answer during this chip crunch is to buy the processor you can buy the processor you can
[1323.88 --> 1332.20]  find at a reasonable price well there you go i lied also the 5800x is in stock at amazon.com right now
[1332.20 --> 1340.76]  i mean there's 189 of shipping and import fees if you ship it to canada wouldn't really recommend that
[1340.76 --> 1349.96]  but it seems possible that this is actually that this is actually in stock right now for 449.99
[1349.96 --> 1351.80]  what's the msrp of this thing supposed to be
[1355.80 --> 1367.80]  5800 there we go 449.uh-huh okay uh well if you needed one of these now's a good time um
[1367.80 --> 1374.28]  um hey wait don't forget to use our affiliate link oh wow the 5900x on the other hand doesn't even like
[1374.28 --> 1384.68]  return a result so that's pretty sweet cool all right so thank you dr cutris for actually indeed
[1384.68 --> 1389.32]  getting all those details in your review i knew i could count on you to be thorough i was hoping to
[1389.32 --> 1393.32]  embarrass you but uh you always get the drop on me don't you ian
[1395.64 --> 1398.44]  tech tech potato is still a bad name for a youtube channel okay
[1401.96 --> 1404.68]  what topic do you want to hit next got him
[1408.44 --> 1418.28]  we can we can talk more about how uh nvidia's is working with gpu miners oh can we oh good sure that
[1418.28 --> 1429.32]  sounds great super fun okay hit me uh the you know the 3080 eth mining wait isn't it the 3060 ti
[1431.80 --> 1436.84]  the ethereum mining limiter rumored to uh to be present on other cards is rumored to be present
[1436.84 --> 1444.20]  on the 3080 ti as well or 3060 i just dyslexia the heck out of this title i'm sorry the 3060
[1444.20 --> 1450.52]  eth mining limiter is rumored to be on the 3080 ti as well um
[1452.60 --> 1457.80]  i'm changing i'm changing the dog while you're trying to that is so rude i saw that right at the
[1457.80 --> 1464.44]  end i'm like hold on a second it is it is the one on the 3060 it is it is the one on the 3060.
[1464.44 --> 1469.80]  you were right you were right it was wrong in the dock you were right and then i changed it to the right
[1469.80 --> 1473.16]  thing and then i changed it back to the wrong thing i'm just messing with them sorry guys oh okay go
[1473.16 --> 1479.88]  ahead you're so red right now it's great uh they were previously correct so the leaker that leaked
[1479.88 --> 1489.32]  this uh copite 7 kimi sure hoping i'm saying that right um has leaked potential specs and info for the
[1489.32 --> 1496.92]  upcoming 3080 ti including a rumor that it has the same eth mining limiter as the recently released 3060.
[1496.92 --> 1502.92]  they were previously correct about ampere months ahead of launch um so it should have 12 gigabytes of
[1502.92 --> 1511.56]  gddr6x at uh width of you keep clicking on things so i can't read it with 384 bits
[1513.00 --> 1524.60]  um ga102 10 240 kuda cores okay what is life anymore um and apparently with the eth mining limiter present
[1524.60 --> 1529.72]  it is scheduled for an april launch uh apparently nvidia has changed the date three times moving
[1529.72 --> 1535.32]  it back from the initial plan date of january and there has been no price revealed yet yeah we were
[1535.32 --> 1545.64]  expecting that there was going to be a 3080 ti alongside uh mobile rtx 30 series at ces this year and
[1545.64 --> 1553.64]  so it sounds this story sounds kind of consistent with the reality that i've been living in um i mean
[1553.64 --> 1561.64]  kudos to nvidia for one thing for delaying this card when they know they can't ship anything else as it is
[1561.64 --> 1568.76]  um i mean i it's just it just feels kind of laughable to me like maybe i don't know maybe this is a bad take
[1568.76 --> 1574.84]  but i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna put it out there anyway nvidia and amd both took the approach
[1574.84 --> 1581.80]  this time around of launching their new stacks top to bottom right so nvidia led with the very high-end
[1581.80 --> 1587.96]  stuff followed up with you know your 3070 and then your 3060 ti like in their typical fashion
[1587.96 --> 1595.24]  amd started with the 58 and 50 excuse me 68 and 6900 series um now they're filling out the gaps
[1595.24 --> 1601.00]  with their upcoming uh what's what's the one they're launching 6700 or something like that
[1601.00 --> 1607.64]  uh is it an x yeah i think it's a 6700 xt um sorry there's a lot of there's a lot of model numbers in
[1607.64 --> 1614.76]  my brain going back many many years and it really doesn't help that amd is launching a 6800 when nvidia
[1614.76 --> 1622.92]  has also had 6800s and amd has also had 6800s in the past it's it's hard to keep the wires from getting
[1622.92 --> 1628.28]  crossed at a certain point anyway it just maybe this is a bad take but i'm kind of looking at it
[1628.28 --> 1637.64]  going okay nvidia if you can sell 3080s all day long and we know that you're gonna have to give up
[1637.64 --> 1647.80]  some of the fab capacity that you planned to use or that you could use for 3080s to build 3070s or 3060
[1647.80 --> 1657.32]  tti's or 3060s but the 3080 is a thousand dollar plus card why don't you just make those for a while
[1657.96 --> 1666.84]  until like i like i'm on i'm honestly here from like uh from like a a brutal capitalistic standpoint
[1667.96 --> 1675.88]  yes you can move a lot of more volume of a 400 or 500 card compared to a thousand or fifteen hundred
[1675.88 --> 1684.12]  dollar card or whatever the case may be but if you don't have to move more volume i'm pretty sure
[1684.12 --> 1692.12]  that everything that i know about like selling things um would indicate that higher average sell prices
[1692.12 --> 1700.36]  are better fewer larger transactions is easier than many more smaller transactions as a general rule
[1700.36 --> 1710.36]  now there is also the the possibility that you know you could create uh negativity in the community
[1710.36 --> 1718.36]  by only catering to you know the very high end it's also very likely that nvidia had already committed
[1718.36 --> 1725.80]  to well they did already commit to 3090 3080 and 3070 at the same time but what they hadn't committed
[1725.80 --> 1731.16]  to already was oh and they had probably also committed to turn off their production on the
[1731.16 --> 1738.20]  previous node of their 20 series what they hadn't committed to yet was the 3060 series and amd for
[1738.20 --> 1745.00]  that matter hadn't already committed to launch the 6700 so if you already can't deliver enough of your
[1745.00 --> 1752.36]  flagship parts why unless they're made of failed flagship parts which in some cases these new products have
[1752.36 --> 1759.16]  not been why are you trying to launch more products that are just going to make another subset of your
[1759.16 --> 1766.52]  customer base mad because they can't get it like if i'm someone who's waiting for a 399 you know like
[1766.52 --> 1771.88]  a 400 card replacement because that's kind of that's like that's how much i spend on a graphics card
[1772.76 --> 1777.24]  i might get impatient because you haven't launched a next-gen replacement for me
[1777.24 --> 1784.44]  but i'm not going to be furious that you've launched one at this supposed price and i can't
[1784.44 --> 1792.68]  get it because it costs 900 or 1100 dollars or whatever like what does it what's a 3060 go for
[1792.68 --> 1801.00]  on ebay right now like what would you go for almost four grand i know that much what would i do i'm just
[1801.00 --> 1807.00]  not buying a card well okay this is not a buyer's market no no if you were in video though
[1807.24 --> 1810.84]  or amd if you're amd do you launch a card today a new card
[1814.20 --> 1820.36]  no i the the thing is though that this may have been planned out so much further in the past they
[1820.36 --> 1823.80]  might already have the packaging for it they might already have like the logistics and everything
[1823.80 --> 1829.88]  planned already it might it might be more damaging to not go through the motions i don't know enough
[1829.88 --> 1834.92]  about it to say that but yeah no no no that's that's totally fair i mean it's very very possible that
[1834.92 --> 1840.84]  they booked the capacity built these chips they're already in the in the pipeline to the board
[1840.84 --> 1846.04]  partners like sure yeah that's that's totally fair it's just
[1850.12 --> 1858.20]  it's just a little bit weird optics yeah for sure yeah definitely okay it looks like a brand new rtx 3060
[1858.20 --> 1867.24]  is going for uh 800 bucks will get you uh some zotac one 900 bucks will get you a tough gaming oc
[1867.96 --> 1876.04]  and then the ti is up more like in the 1200 range to start with up 12 that's wild 1300 for a founder's
[1876.04 --> 1884.28]  edition like that is utter madness if you have a perfectly capable gpu right now and it blows
[1884.28 --> 1894.12]  like it dies i feel very bad for you yeah that's rough if only someone was doing something to make
[1894.12 --> 1905.00]  sure that people can buy graphics cards at msrp without a scalper markup if only someone would make sure
[1905.00 --> 1911.32]  that verified actual gamers get their hands on graphics cards
[1914.92 --> 1920.04]  who will answer this call luke who will answer this call i don't think anyone it's way too hard
[1920.92 --> 1926.52]  there's i i can't imagine because it would have to be someone new right it couldn't be someone in this
[1926.52 --> 1931.08]  space already they'd have to have relationships with board partners they'd have to be able to get
[1931.08 --> 1936.44]  allocation yep getting units is going to be tough the board partners would probably have to be on
[1936.44 --> 1945.56]  board with it yep no pun intended oh yeah i liked it i liked it okay it's impossible so it's time for
[1945.56 --> 1955.16]  the big reveal sometime next week we will be launching the verified actual gamer program for our first drop
[1955.16 --> 1963.48]  i don't want to over promise to you guys we are working with asus okay we have only between i don't
[1963.48 --> 1970.76]  know exactly how many we have it's between 80 and 100 cards i'm gonna be i'm gonna give you guys too much
[1970.76 --> 1976.04]  detail okay i'm gonna be honest with you guys in a way that could get me in trouble the reason i don't
[1976.04 --> 1982.92]  know exactly how many are coming is because one of the piece of middlemen that was involved in this transaction
[1982.92 --> 1993.48]  uh kind of oopsie daisies accidentally lost or what really happened was sold to someone else
[1993.48 --> 1998.28]  some of the cards that were supposed to come to me for the verified actual gamer program
[1998.28 --> 2003.96]  um oh hold on a second nick is calling me he's real upset what do you want
[2006.20 --> 2009.84]  about what hold on hold on hold on hold on just tell me just tell me what's going on
[2012.92 --> 2025.24]  i think i think he's muted but i think i'm still with you i think i'm still here i have no idea
[2025.24 --> 2029.16]  what's going on at this point i knew about the system i knew about the plan i was trying to hype
[2029.16 --> 2034.92]  it up i didn't know about this part of the story i didn't expect nick to call so the point is the point
[2034.92 --> 2041.16]  is i don't know exactly how many of them we're gonna have but we have done some really cool work
[2041.16 --> 2047.56]  to make sure that when these things are available in the way that they will be available there is
[2048.12 --> 2055.48]  i'm nothing is perfect but there is a very very very high probability that every single one of them
[2055.48 --> 2061.16]  will make their way into the hands of a verified actual gamer so we're not giving you guys the full
[2061.16 --> 2067.88]  details this second but luke and some of the other guys on the float plane team have been hard at work
[2067.88 --> 2073.24]  on this from a development side from the development side of things and what you're gonna want to do
[2073.96 --> 2083.24]  is if you're a real gamer and if you need a graphics card okay so we've got some rtx 3080s rtx 3090s
[2083.24 --> 2095.16]  and i believe i am allowed to tease that we are also working with amd on some products that amd sells
[2095.16 --> 2102.68]  and we are also working with msi on some products that msi sells so this is all going to be happening
[2102.68 --> 2107.80]  hopefully over the next few weeks what you are going to want to do to make sure that you are in
[2107.80 --> 2113.64]  the know and getting the info as early as possible is you're going to want to watch this episode of the
[2113.64 --> 2120.60]  wan show where i tell you guys what else you're going to need to do congratulations you already did that
[2120.60 --> 2128.04]  part the next thing you're going to need to do is you are going to need to make sure that you are
[2128.04 --> 2135.72]  subscribed on linus tech tips you are watching every video the instant it goes live and the only way
[2135.72 --> 2143.64]  to do that is to make sure to ring the bell don't be a ding dong okay that's luke's joke that's luke's joke
[2143.64 --> 2148.76]  don't be a ding dong ring the ding dong that's luke's joke i'm not taking credit for that uh it
[2148.76 --> 2155.32]  may be that in the future i will uh take us over to maybe a different channel like short circuit for
[2155.32 --> 2162.52]  example uh but it's quite likely that this is all going to be on the linus tech tips channel
[2162.52 --> 2169.32]  another pro tip guys there is an even better way to see a linus tech tips video right away when it
[2169.32 --> 2177.80]  launches than ringing the bell if you go back in time to the long long ago of just looking at our
[2177.80 --> 2183.80]  publish history you'll see that there's a bit of a pattern to when we publish our videos i would
[2183.80 --> 2192.28]  suggest that it is likely that we will include this information somewhere in one of the videos that we
[2192.28 --> 2202.12]  published at our let's say typical time okay does that sound good to everybody there's a whole big
[2202.12 --> 2207.08]  thing in here that says don't say this part don't say this part should i say that part i don't think
[2207.08 --> 2213.40]  so no i don't think i'm gonna say that part so we're really excited about this we're really excited
[2213.40 --> 2220.52]  to be working with asus amd and msi those are the ones that we've uh that we've talked to about this
[2220.52 --> 2226.28]  program they have actually worked really hard to make this possible because as you guys may or may
[2226.28 --> 2234.68]  not know uh linus media group incorporated is not exactly a retailer you know what i mean um so we don't
[2234.68 --> 2240.68]  we're not really set up to buy computer hardware in bulk um so there was a lot of work from the
[2240.68 --> 2249.24]  creator warehouse team the flow plane team asus amd msi getting all this stuff cleared um and trying to
[2249.24 --> 2254.36]  find a way to make it make sense for everyone and i can tell you right now the bottom line is that
[2254.36 --> 2262.28]  the only reason that any of this makes any sense is because they actually care they liked our idea
[2262.28 --> 2270.04]  uh and they actually care about helping us get these products to verified actual gamers so i'm i'm super
[2270.04 --> 2275.40]  excited uh people like just say the part no no i'm not i'm not going to be saying the part i was i was
[2275.40 --> 2279.48]  just messing with loop uh that stuff i really really don't want to talk about yet
[2283.08 --> 2288.28]  so stay tuned guys this is going to be i mean that's the stuff that's going to be in the video
[2289.32 --> 2296.84]  and that's why you need to ring the bell so flow plane oh uh joe soap asks what about flow plane
[2296.84 --> 2304.04]  subscribers uh do i still need to check on youtube we will make sure that the video launch like okay that
[2304.04 --> 2309.80]  the video launch is going to be at the same time on flow plane as on youtube so you guys will get the
[2309.80 --> 2316.60]  same chance as everyone else but unfortunately i cannot give you guys any kind of advantage for
[2316.60 --> 2324.20]  the verified actual gamer program because if i did and float plane was a paid membership which it is
[2324.20 --> 2331.56]  then we would risk running afoul of lottery laws gambling laws which last time i checked get enforced pretty
[2332.12 --> 2339.72]  hardcore and i really do not want to deal with that my life does not need it okay does that kind of make
[2339.72 --> 2347.40]  sense guys linus misses ncix so much he just remade it better faster and stronger thanks cyberdyne over on
[2347.40 --> 2355.96]  float plane exactly exactly we're going we're going full circle here boys okay i started out making videos
[2355.96 --> 2362.68]  for a tech retailer and then now i'm going to be a tech retailer that wait no i started out making
[2362.68 --> 2369.48]  video now i'm going to be a video maker that turns into a tech retailer we got this we got this
[2370.68 --> 2377.32]  oh wait only in like drop form you trules asked is quebec included it's not a giveaway it's just an
[2377.32 --> 2383.00]  opportunity to buy it at msrp so yes yes you can definitely buy it um
[2383.00 --> 2389.72]  um in response to anyone on staff who's watching this including at float plane and creator warehouse
[2390.36 --> 2397.24]  no you are not eligible unfortunately because you have access to the people either directly or
[2397.24 --> 2404.36]  indirectly who are working on this project you simply cannot have one and we we will make sure
[2404.36 --> 2410.84]  you do not get one oh oh poor float plane staff is in the chat we know we know
[2413.16 --> 2423.00]  yeah that's rough okay i'm sorry i'm sorry hopefully you guys are hyped we are expecting
[2423.00 --> 2428.60]  somewhere in the neighborhood it's like honestly guys i don't want to set unrealistic expectations
[2428.60 --> 2434.44]  because can ozzy's join the giveaway it's not a giveaway it's not a giveaway okay it's not a
[2434.44 --> 2440.84]  giveaway it's just a chance to buy them okay so there's a few things that we need to clarify here one
[2440.84 --> 2449.64]  is that there is nothing we can do about tariffs if you are american and the stock that we get is uh
[2449.64 --> 2458.68]  not was not imported pre-tariff okay we actually do have some that came in pre-tariff still so that's
[2458.68 --> 2463.40]  how long we've been working on this that should give you some idea but if the stock we have which
[2463.40 --> 2470.84]  some of it will be is post tariff from the trump administration we cannot do anything about that
[2470.84 --> 2478.36]  there will be a 25 surcharge cannot help you with it it just is what it is if you don't like it
[2478.36 --> 2485.32]  you tell your government you don't like it it has nothing to do with me same thing if you were to buy
[2485.32 --> 2492.60]  it from the eu for example there is nothing i can do about any kind of value-added tax or any other
[2492.60 --> 2501.40]  kinds of surcharges uh oh okay apparently i was mistaken we do not have any that are pre-tariff it did
[2501.40 --> 2508.20]  not end up working out that way so they are all tariffed um someone's asking about postage costs
[2508.36 --> 2514.44]  you will have to pay separately for that we we just to give you guys some idea we there is not
[2514.44 --> 2523.08]  a ton of margin in computer hardware guys like it's it's a cut throat business okay remember that time
[2523.08 --> 2530.52]  that new egg tried to go public and it was revealed that their net profit was like one percent like it is
[2530.52 --> 2535.88]  not there's a reason i haven't tried to become a computer hardware retailer okay it's not that i don't
[2535.88 --> 2540.36]  know it's not that i don't have the relationships it's not that i don't know how to put a cpu in a
[2540.36 --> 2547.88]  box and ship it out the door it's because i want nothing to do with that business this is just about
[2547.88 --> 2554.28]  us making sure that whatever we can get our hands on we have bought as much as we can in bulk makes its
[2554.28 --> 2562.44]  way to verified actual gamers from our community all right um so yes if you are somewhere else in the
[2562.44 --> 2568.12]  world you will have to pay postage it's probably going to be brutal depending where you are because
[2568.12 --> 2574.44]  we don't have amazing rates with canada post or fedex or whoever else we're still a relatively small
[2574.44 --> 2584.84]  timer all right cool so why don't we move on my mic was needed sorry one second someone was asking
[2584.84 --> 2592.68]  what currency will the cards be listed in uh they'll be listed in usd yeah uh but they will be
[2592.68 --> 2598.36]  listed at pre-tariff prices because for example if someone in canada were to buy them they would not
[2598.36 --> 2604.92]  be subject to the u.s tariffs so does that kind of make sense guys because we're in canada we haven't
[2604.92 --> 2613.48]  paid a tariff on them yet you guys follow so if we ship them to the u.s the second they touch u.s soil
[2613.48 --> 2619.96]  they are subject to this 25 tariff again another potentially oh sorry yeah go ahead hit me another
[2619.96 --> 2627.08]  potentially tricky question is a moderator was asking what about them a moderator like on the
[2627.08 --> 2633.80]  forum like forum moderator discord moderator twitch chat moderator they to my knowledge they they will
[2633.80 --> 2639.48]  have absolutely no it had nothing to do with this yeah they will have no early access to information
[2639.48 --> 2647.40]  and uh internally only i and nick and luke are probably going to know exactly when the video
[2647.40 --> 2655.00]  is going to go live so i think that should be fine yep okay cool they are they can be verified actual
[2655.00 --> 2664.84]  gamers 100 nice all right let's go ahead and oh right that's a really good point uh if you've had bad
[2664.84 --> 2670.84]  experiences with shipments from canada before like grok 23 where they've taken a really long time
[2671.96 --> 2677.72]  maybe this just isn't the right deal for you uh because the last thing i want is for this to be
[2677.72 --> 2684.44]  stuck in you know shipping for two months which can happen absolutely and then for you to have a real bad
[2684.44 --> 2690.68]  time because some thousand dollar product is tied up for two months and by that time graphics card prices
[2690.68 --> 2699.88]  are back to sanity all right all right cool so why don't we move on to our next topic here the uh oh
[2699.88 --> 2710.60]  the sponsors for the show today hey redux.com redux is a pc builder that's striving to bring pc gaming to
[2710.60 --> 2719.16]  the masses there's no price markup on the individual components just a 75 dollar build key build key build fee
[2719.16 --> 2724.84]  so you just select your budget pick the games you want to play see how they perform make sure it
[2724.84 --> 2730.28]  meets your expectations or increase your budget then you let them build your pc their online
[2730.28 --> 2735.80]  configurator lets you see what's going to go and gone inside what does that even mean whatever the
[2735.80 --> 2740.92]  point is their online pc configurator has lots of great tools to allow you to make sure that you've got
[2740.92 --> 2745.00]  something that's going to meet your expectations for the games you want to play plus redux will give you

[2757.80 --> 2763.80]  around pointless items in your pockets like receipts old hotel room keys remember hotels and spent gift
[2763.80 --> 2769.08]  cards a ridge wallet will help you carry less it uses two metal plates that are bound together by a strong
[2769.08 --> 2774.84]  elastic band to keep your cards tightly together but still easily accessible ridge wallets are rfid

[2884.44 --> 2889.72]  would you like to pay uh to access my member area oh lordy
[2892.20 --> 2903.80]  i mean oh no oh boy that's uh man someone internally must have brought that up yeah i don't know it's one
[2903.80 --> 2909.00]  of those things like nobody called me on the name of the verified actual gamer program every company we've
[2909.00 --> 2915.64]  worked with yeah nobody was like you're really gonna call it that i don't know man i mean maybe maybe
[2915.64 --> 2924.44]  we just like maybe not everyone actually has a potty mind you know not everyone grew up listening to blink
[2924.44 --> 2934.04]  182 i guess maybe it's that simple right maybe i just that seems so obvious uh oh boy we got some real
[2934.04 --> 2939.64]  questions about the verified actual gamer program up in here alexis what if we were to pick up the
[2939.64 --> 2947.88]  card in canada across the border a you would be violating uh covid um restrictions so don't do that
[2949.16 --> 2957.48]  and b then you would have to pay tariffs because it would touch us soil there you go happy to help uh
[2957.48 --> 2963.96]  that's that's what i do it's awesome comments that looked like they were confused you're not avoiding
[2963.96 --> 2970.44]  the tariffs by buying a card in america to be clear yeah you still have to pay them that's why they're so
[2970.44 --> 2977.72]  expensive also it's part of why they're so expensive now yeah it happens when any card enters the states
[2977.72 --> 2985.96]  it doesn't matter how so what is this google is now a privacy company what does that even mean
[2985.96 --> 2994.28]  i okay let's go up to this it's uh help me out here luke i'm i'm not helping right now it's it's
[2994.28 --> 3001.72]  it's odd um so back in 2019 google announced that they had intent uh that they had intended wait that
[3001.72 --> 3007.88]  they had intent of working with other companies to build a more private web uh i remember this i
[3007.88 --> 3014.52]  believe we laughed um that does sound like what we would do and then moved on on march 3rd a post on
[3014.52 --> 3019.72]  the official google blog followed this up with more information and bold statements that contrast
[3019.72 --> 3025.56]  uh google's data harvesting strategies yeah this is weird and they have to have something up their
[3025.56 --> 3031.08]  sleeves i suspect there's something like google proprietary that they're working on but we'll get
[3031.08 --> 3037.00]  into that in a moment to try to make it so that more stuff funnels through them by doing this but um
[3037.00 --> 3043.24]  um third party cookies also known as cross-site tracking cookies will be phased out in google chrome
[3045.64 --> 3053.56]  really hmm yeah google claims that they will not be building any alternate identifiers to track
[3053.56 --> 3059.64]  individuals sure as they're browsing the web and additionally that they will not use these trackers
[3060.44 --> 3065.80]  that they that they definitely super aren't building they're definitely not making anything okay hold on
[3065.80 --> 3073.24]  can i can i just jump in here and say is it possible that google has built an ai so powerful
[3073.88 --> 3081.72]  that it it like can infer everything about you just by the one site you're on like the one thing you're
[3081.72 --> 3088.68]  doing and it doesn't even need the history anymore so maybe google is just making it impossible for their
[3088.68 --> 3096.60]  less technologically advanced competitors to track you but they've still got you nailed down i also
[3096.60 --> 3103.24]  wonder if there's just like if if if cookies are too accessible to other companies and they have like
[3103.24 --> 3110.36]  it feels like they they might be trying to heighten the barrier of entry yeah yeah that totally makes sense
[3110.36 --> 3116.20]  so they have other things already whether it's tracking through your phone whether it's tracking through your
[3116.20 --> 3122.52]  your email um all these other various things and they're thinking okay if we kill cookies yeah it's
[3122.52 --> 3128.28]  bad for us but maybe it's worse for others that's maybe something that i'm expecting here okay it's uh
[3128.92 --> 3136.20]  it's weird despite these altruistic uh it says in here intentions i'm gonna say claims uh despite these
[3136.20 --> 3141.64]  altruistic claims google is still a business that needs to make money yes very much so and advertising
[3141.64 --> 3146.28]  makes up a substantial portion of the revenue not to mention if we're going to if we're going to be
[3146.28 --> 3151.32]  shown ads it's usually best for them to be relevant which tracking cookies facilitate yes of course in
[3151.32 --> 3157.40]  their post google writes advances in aggregation anonymization and on device processing and other
[3157.40 --> 3165.08]  privacy preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers in fact our latest tests
[3165.08 --> 3173.64]  of floc show one way to effectively take third-party cookies out of the advertising equation and instead
[3173.64 --> 3179.72]  hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests oh my so maybe you're on it
[3179.72 --> 3188.20]  chrome intends to make floc based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next
[3188.20 --> 3194.92]  release this month wow so i actually kind of like nailed it yep good job nice i actually i had
[3194.92 --> 3201.72]  not read the notes yet this is awesome basically your device will build a profile of you and you'll be
[3201.72 --> 3209.64]  put into into a general category of interests as opposed to having a comprehensive pattern outline
[3209.64 --> 3215.88]  based on browsing history and form information in theory this should still be effective at advertising
[3215.88 --> 3223.16]  but also in preserving user privacy more strongly uh how this will function in practice is a story that only
[3223.16 --> 3230.84]  time will tell all right so i guess i have nothing else to say about this because i already uh said what
[3230.84 --> 3236.76]  i thought it was going to be and i was that wasn't quite right i didn't realize that it would uh use like
[3236.76 --> 3244.68]  you know your device to create the like like a history of you and then kind of file you into a neat tidy
[3244.68 --> 3252.12]  little group but i mean that's fundamentally pretty much what google was using the individual information for
[3252.12 --> 3259.00]  anyway so it's not a huge paradigm shift like luke said all this really does is increase the barrier to entry
[3259.00 --> 3268.12]  so that other providers who want to deliver context appropriate ads are going to have to use google's service here
[3269.64 --> 3278.12]  that's uh wow good job wow that is uh that is incredible so google is a privacy company in the sense that
[3278.12 --> 3283.88]  they want to make sure that your data is private from everybody but google they want to make sure that
[3283.88 --> 3290.28]  all the money is privately theirs i like it i like it thanks google they're publicly traded company yeah
[3290.28 --> 3298.60]  thanks google you are you are truly a benevolent overlord please yes bless upon me with your blessings
[3298.60 --> 3308.60]  speaking of blessings ltt store a new t-shirt oh yeah so this is a really cool shirt it actually looks
[3308.60 --> 3315.48]  awesome it's kind of uh it's kind of a new what yeah yeah i didn't realize you were wearing it yeah
[3315.48 --> 3322.76]  it's kind of a new cpu design but what's really special about it is we've been playing around with the
[3322.76 --> 3329.96]  uh like the reflective dyes that we've used to do some of our uh really shiny products and mixing them
[3329.96 --> 3336.68]  in with regular dyes so this one right here oh no this is this is not that this is a different thing uh
[3337.96 --> 3347.32]  wait what uh nothing carry on so uh what we're doing is we are mixing a not a shiny uh thing so this is
[3347.32 --> 3354.60]  actually a reflective dye so what happens is because i'm using a really soft light right now you can't
[3354.60 --> 3363.24]  really see it but under a uv light or under a very bright light this will actually kind of glow like a
[3363.24 --> 3372.44]  like a reflector on your bicycle helmet uh or like a reflective strip so both the cpu and the ltt on the
[3372.44 --> 3377.24]  back are this kind of like cool reflective material so if you're in the dark and like a light shines
[3377.24 --> 3383.72]  that it'll kind of like it'll kind of glow um on your on your chest if you're into that sort of thing
[3383.72 --> 3391.96]  so that's available over on ltt store right now uh so go ahead and buy one and make sure that you set
[3391.96 --> 3399.48]  it up to save your information um so that next time you need to use ltt store it'll be really fast to go
[3399.48 --> 3416.92]  through the checkout okay um to do is that is that sort of it no i want to talk about the 6700 xt being
[3416.92 --> 3423.56]  a paper launch where's this i remember reading that reading about that where is this there it is uh are
[3423.56 --> 3432.84]  you surprised no in fact the first frame of our video is anthony literally launching paper at my
[3432.84 --> 3440.92]  head oh i saw that right yeah so no we were pretty sure that was going to happen but but amd amd has
[3440.92 --> 3448.04]  not learned anything uh from their long history of over promising and under delivering uh this is a quote
[3448.04 --> 3455.48]  with the amd radeon rx 6700 xt launch we are on track to have significantly more gpus available for
[3455.48 --> 3461.80]  sale at launch we know it's crazy out there but we're doing everything we can why not just say
[3462.44 --> 3470.12]  it's going to be impossible to get one like i i don't know uh uh uh yeah they said before that the
[3470.12 --> 3475.64]  rx 6000 series would not be a paper launch uh they've all sold out like basically instantly frank
[3475.64 --> 3482.12]  azor famously tweeted i look forward to taking your ten dollars when another user tweeted ten
[3482.12 --> 3489.56]  dollars says amd will be a paper launch too now what's uh really not going to help or maybe make
[3489.56 --> 3495.56]  no difference at all is that the mining capabilities of these cards will not be limited unlike the rtx 360
[3495.56 --> 3501.24]  from nvidia so you'll be fighting with scalpers and miners to obtain a card per usual if you do manage
[3501.24 --> 3504.92]  to get one you could theoretically mine on it to make some of your money back over time we're actually
[3504.92 --> 3510.92]  going to have a video about how to set up nice hash um which is a really easy to use mining software
[3510.92 --> 3517.08]  to be clear i'm not i'm not telling people go out there and become a commercial miner you know set up
[3517.08 --> 3523.96]  you know 10 rigs of 10 gpus and suck up all the gpus i'm talking about gamers who happen to have a card
[3523.96 --> 3529.88]  subsidizing their gaming hobby with some light mining i'm particularly feeling guilt-free about
[3529.88 --> 3534.52]  recommending it right now because at least in my part of the world it happens to still be winter
[3534.52 --> 3540.92]  and so i'm not gonna lie at the office some of our powerful workstations are set up to mine when
[3540.92 --> 3546.68]  they're idle because we have to heat the building anyway so like it might as well be making money
[3546.68 --> 3550.92]  rather than costing money like i'm not i'm not going to apologize for that we don't have any specific
[3550.92 --> 3556.52]  mining rigs set up but we definitely do have some rigs that are mining and so like if you're a gamer
[3557.64 --> 3563.56]  why not you got to heat your house anyway you got the gpu anyway what the hey uh especially especially it's
[3563.56 --> 3570.20]  all it's all about if your house is actually cold because then my house is my i shouldn't say house
[3570.20 --> 3575.88]  i don't have a house my place is incredibly hot all the time because i think both my neighbors just
[3575.88 --> 3582.44]  crank it so it's like i'm like i'm sweating right now so that's not really an option for me yeah well
[3582.44 --> 3587.64]  at any rate if you are not actually just wasting electricity for no reason and you'd have to heat up
[3587.64 --> 3593.56]  your place anyway i i see it as a as a win-win um and right so what's great about that is that even
[3593.56 --> 3598.44]  if you have really old hardware you don't have to care about the power efficiency of it because
[3598.44 --> 3606.28]  you're just heating your house yay and oh there was one other thing that we said that we would talk
[3606.28 --> 3611.24]  about on the show today oh should we just at least mention that this eight-year-old became a
[3611.24 --> 3619.88]  professional fortnite player what joseph dean signed with team 33 in december last year got a 33 000
[3619.88 --> 3628.76]  signing bonus and a gaming pc meanwhile the game is rated pegi 12 or esrb teen he's been playing
[3629.96 --> 3635.72]  that's not a law though no it's not yeah he was playing since he was four and first noticed by the
[3635.72 --> 3645.08]  esports team when he was six and a half what holy that is nuts i mean i guess it's not that crazy uh
[3645.08 --> 3651.32]  only two of the top 10 highest earning esports uh uh excuse me fortnite players are over 18.
[3651.96 --> 3658.52]  and the world cup in 2019 was won by then 16 year old kyle bugha gisdorf who walked away with three
[3658.52 --> 3665.48]  million dollars this is crazy too joseph's mom gigi says she only lets him play for two or three hours a
[3665.48 --> 3671.72]  day after school and more on weekends i mean that's like a lot but it's not night and day like
[3671.72 --> 3676.52]  he's not going to school he's like you know on the professional gamer track or anything like that
[3676.52 --> 3687.16]  like still going to school that's uh that's kind of that's kind of crazy it is kind of crazy he plays
[3687.16 --> 3693.00]  piano he says playing piano helped him a lot with the keyboard he says and mouse but i mean that could
[3693.00 --> 3697.72]  maybe make sense yeah just i mean having good fine motor control is never a bad thing when it comes
[3697.72 --> 3705.40]  to operating a computer i know you can often kind of identify pianists when they type because they're
[3705.96 --> 3712.60]  yeah i know yeah they're often very good typists so that makes sense age prevents him from streaming on
[3712.60 --> 3719.80]  twitch oh man in 2019 an 11 year old professional player was actually banned from twitch after his real
[3719.80 --> 3725.48]  age was discovered i remember that yeah this is crazy all right okay the last thing we wanted to
[3725.48 --> 3731.96]  talk about was the arizona house bill that would require an allowance for third-party payment on app
[3731.96 --> 3737.08]  platforms i mean this is sort of pertinent to you you want to run us through this one or shall i oh
[3737.08 --> 3743.56]  yeah sure um just before we jump into that one thing i want to mention is that some people have been
[3743.56 --> 3750.36]  asking about the desk pads and i have heard from nick um that apparently there will be a late march
[3750.36 --> 3758.12]  restock we hope anything can happen in this covid world ladies and gentlemen there's nothing we can do
[3758.12 --> 3763.56]  to prevent you know a container from getting stuck in the port for two or three weeks so don't hold your
[3763.56 --> 3768.68]  breath uh i don't want to guarantee anything but that is the most current information we have
[3768.68 --> 3776.12]  yeah now we're going to be talking about some american politics a lot of people know we don't
[3776.12 --> 3782.12]  necessarily know everything about american politics uh arizona house advances bill requiring allowance for
[3782.12 --> 3788.52]  third-party payment on app platforms sounds super cool mobile software development community might be in for a big change
[3789.96 --> 3797.56]  in arizona the bill hb 2005 backed by the coalition for app fairness
[3797.56 --> 3805.96]  uh composed of epic match and spotify includes an amendment that specifically prohibits stores
[3805.96 --> 3812.76]  exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring a developer that is uh domiciled in this state
[3813.88 --> 3822.92]  to use a particular in-app payment system as an exclusive mode of payments so if you have a headquarters in
[3822.92 --> 3829.16]  arizona you'd be able to use another one that's so oddly specific i mean that's the way it is in the
[3829.16 --> 3836.12]  states though right it's basically like 52 countries many countries and then some other countries that
[3836.12 --> 3843.80]  don't count as countries for whatever because they're like districts or whatever little and too new or
[3843.80 --> 3852.04]  something who knows um well i don't think they're particularly new like uh puerto rico is not new oh
[3852.04 --> 3858.52]  right that's fair yeah um i don't follow guam guam is not especially new i don't think
[3861.00 --> 3871.56]  rough um this is this is all of this is even after 1898 but wow they're very not new 1898 was when guam
[3871.56 --> 3876.84]  became a u.s territory yeah sorry i will let you finish go ahead sorry they were notably newer than
[3876.84 --> 3884.04]  that no um so this is after intense lobbying effects uh efforts sorry by apple against the bill
[3884.04 --> 3892.20]  uh the bill narrowly passed uh 31 to 29 with all but one democrat voting against and all but one republican
[3892.20 --> 3905.16]  voting for it um david heinemeyer looks good to me nice uh david heinemeyer hansen the creator of hay
[3905.16 --> 3909.88]  who got in a spat with apple about this very topic back in june 2020 on twitter you guys might remember
[3909.88 --> 3913.96]  that if you've been watching wancho for a long time we talked about it uh is prepared to move his company
[3913.96 --> 3921.80]  to arizona should the bill pass other developers might want to join i mean yeah happening 100 if we were
[3921.80 --> 3926.52]  an american developer and this was like definitely becoming a thing i would be poking linus and being
[3926.52 --> 3933.56]  like hey we need to figure something out because it is actually that big of a deal um the bill still has
[3933.56 --> 3940.52]  to make it through the senate and not get vetoed by the governor before enshrining in the law the issue
[3940.52 --> 3945.72]  has spread to other states with minnesota and potentially in illinois uh introducing similar
[3945.72 --> 3951.64]  legislation so we'll have to see how this goes fascinating can i just say like kudos
[3951.64 --> 3959.32]  to the uh to the republicans in arizona for pushing this forward like this is
[3960.76 --> 3970.68]  it's all fine and good for a marketplace to you know allow you to use it that's good but that's not
[3971.40 --> 3976.92]  fair and open competition that's that's a gun to your head basically if you want to be a mobile
[3976.92 --> 3984.20]  developer then you're just going to have to use our store and do things our way um i i absolutely
[3985.40 --> 3991.80]  i i'm yeah i'm i'm good i'm good this looks good it's it's it's largely specific because i know some
[3991.80 --> 3997.24]  people are going to bring up like well you don't have to join that mark it's it's largely to do with
[3997.24 --> 4008.12]  with the mobile space yep and how how how small and binary the mobile space is i uh i i think this
[4008.12 --> 4014.44]  is such a smart play from arizona because there's a lot of ways that you can attract business to your
[4014.44 --> 4020.36]  city or to your county or to your state or to your country right and one of the ways that lawmakers seem
[4020.36 --> 4028.04]  to lean on like immediately they go straight for the tax breaks and the grants and it's like uh
[4028.68 --> 4034.84]  actually there's a lot of other things that you could do to be more business friendly like just
[4035.48 --> 4043.40]  help businesses make money um and not just you know have them not pay any taxes so you can't build
[4043.40 --> 4050.20]  roads and maintain your schools and all that stuff uh icj says politics i'm gone it's not politics
[4050.20 --> 4056.84]  it's tech it just happens to be that sometimes tech gets affected by politics and it's that's why
[4056.84 --> 4065.16]  politics is important it really does matter i i suspect you'll see more developers than just hey
[4065.16 --> 4070.84]  making that move as well i suspect some of them might wait to see what other states glom on we did
[4070.84 --> 4075.08]  we did mention at least two names and there might be more after that someone might hold their cards
[4075.08 --> 4079.32]  and wait to see if there's one a little closer to home or one that is literally their home
[4079.96 --> 4085.00]  but i would not be surprised if there was i would not be surprised if there at all if there was
[4085.00 --> 4091.00]  movement of pre-existing companies and i can pretty much guarantee that if there's a new company a very
[4091.00 --> 4097.80]  small one that is thinking of starting up they will strategically start somewhere 100 that might not
[4097.80 --> 4102.84]  be something that you hear a ton about yeah you'll you'll hear more about companies moving you won't
[4102.84 --> 4108.28]  hear a ton about companies strategically starting in a specific area but i guarantee you that will happen
[4108.28 --> 4114.20]  drummel asks why did the democrats vote against it that's very surprising don't be surprised uh you
[4114.20 --> 4119.56]  know there's no political party that's actually on your team it all comes down to you know what
[4120.44 --> 4125.80]  gets them in office and at the end of the day if this is a small time issue that isn't making national
[4125.80 --> 4136.52]  news um and so there's no kind of there's no attention on it it's much easier for one side or another to end up
[4136.52 --> 4145.16]  being lobbied into doing something that's off-brand for them so there you have it sorry to kind of burst your
[4145.16 --> 4152.84]  bubble there if you are as simple enough to brand yourself as one or the other then you pretty much
[4153.48 --> 4160.36]  um i i don't know what to say to you you have to analyze each issue individually you can't just
[4160.36 --> 4167.48]  don't fall for the branding treat political parties like companies because they are pretty much the same
[4167.48 --> 4175.40]  thing it doesn't matter what it is okay retailer sports team political party they're all companies
[4175.40 --> 4182.68]  they're all trying to sell you and market you something so try to ignore it try to just look
