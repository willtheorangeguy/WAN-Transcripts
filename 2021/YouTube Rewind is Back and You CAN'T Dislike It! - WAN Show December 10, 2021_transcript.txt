[0.00 --> 12.66]  and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[12.66 --> 24.24]  YouTube rewind yeah it's gonna get nothing but thumbs up because it's impossible to see anything
[24.24 --> 32.46]  else sort of and the RTX 2060 12 gig has launched and um in a massive shock to everyone it is not in
[32.46 --> 37.56]  stock anywhere what else we got this week the game Awards Awards Awards to games and announces
[37.56 --> 44.88]  announcements hooray wow okay we're gonna have to talk about that it takes two one game of the year
[44.88 --> 51.18]  um we'll talk about that I promise in other gaming news the trailer for Ubisoft's nft
[51.18 --> 57.54]  cosmetic system called quartz got so many dislikes it was unlisted I don't think automatically right
[57.54 --> 62.76]  like they just pulled it down uh I mean it can't happen automatically but yeah but how how could
[62.76 --> 67.50]  it get so many dislikes and how could anybody know well we're gonna talk about that too aren't we
[67.50 --> 69.66]  yeah but first we're gonna roll the intro yeah
[81.18 --> 85.02]  so many people unironically answering my question as though I don't know the answer to it
[85.02 --> 92.22]  the one about how you could possibly see dislikes and the show is brought to you by FreshBooks
[92.22 --> 100.44]  Redux and Anchor we talked about it on WAN show last week I I I I Luke I know I know that I needed
[100.44 --> 104.10]  to answer that part of your question you gotta you what you need to do is look into your microphone
[104.10 --> 109.54]  oh I can hear myself so clearly though uh yeah maybe it's the headphones let's jump right into our
[109.54 --> 117.70]  first topic of the day uh wait is there even is this even like in the doc or what one uh the one
[117.70 --> 124.18]  about YouTube rewind coming back no it's not okay YouTube rewind maybe we'll talk about that in a
[124.18 --> 134.98]  minute let's do uh let's do our second topic of the day first topic is going to be that uh the RTX 2060
[134.98 --> 141.46]  12 gig has launched and as you guys might have noticed we did a video about it talking about you
[141.46 --> 150.58]  know what a new RTX 2060 might be like how this might affect the overall supply of graphics cards for
[150.58 --> 157.86]  gamers why Nvidia might have made the seemingly somewhat controversial move of increasing it to 12
[157.86 --> 165.46]  gigs of gddr6 memory especially when you consider that some you know gddr6 shortages have occurred over
[165.46 --> 175.38]  the last year and a half and basically as far as we can tell this whole thing was super sketchy because
[175.38 --> 181.86]  this wasn't this was basically barely even a rumor until all of a sudden it went from barely a rumor to
[181.86 --> 190.74]  confirmed and launched over a span of days as far as we're aware no press were seated units for review
[190.74 --> 196.18]  so there was no real way to evaluate it in spite of the fact that it is a different card it's somewhere
[196.18 --> 202.18]  in between the 2060 and the 2060 super and obviously it's got a larger frame buffer which we would have
[202.18 --> 208.74]  loved to investigate but the official availability is supposed to be somewhere in the neighborhood of
[208.74 --> 216.98]  around three to three and a half weeks after the actual launch which occurred on december the 7th
[216.98 --> 226.66]  or in early 2022 so this is actually about the most paper launch launch that we've seen in a very very
[226.66 --> 233.94]  long time uh in fact it's it's to the point now where when we did our video we did hear back from a
[233.94 --> 241.46]  board partner asus got back to us and we were like hey so obviously the burning question on
[241.46 --> 248.18]  everyone's mind is how much does this thing cost and they were like if i know
[250.18 --> 252.18]  hope it worked yeah i hope the button worked
[254.42 --> 263.06]  um early european listings suggest a price of roughly 660 to 700 us dollars although it's often not as
[263.06 --> 271.94]  simple as just doing a currency conversion from european pounds pound rubles whatever currency they
[271.94 --> 277.94]  have over there euros that's the one from euros or or pounds or whatever other currency to us dollars
[277.94 --> 282.82]  a lot of the time it ends up being a lot closer to a one-to-one exchange rate even though that's
[282.82 --> 289.78]  really not how things work yeah um previous leaked listings from french e-tailor pc21 started at 500 us but
[289.78 --> 296.42]  they've been bumped up to around 609 and anthony jumps in to say that this is pre-vat so that could
[296.42 --> 304.42]  be pretty rough especially when you consider the launch price of the rtx 3060 which was luke
[305.62 --> 314.66]  where did it go i just saw 329 dollars 329 that's right the rtx 2060 and 2060 super both launched at
[314.66 --> 323.78]  349 three years ago and are apparently now going to be relaunching at somewhere in the neighborhood of
[323.78 --> 330.02]  500 to 700 us dollars and that assumes that you can even find one in stock wouldn't that be sweet as a
[330.02 --> 335.78]  business the craziest part of this the craziest part of this it's basically real estate gpus are behaving
[335.78 --> 341.14]  like real estate to the point where like okay honestly though vancouver especially commercial real
[341.14 --> 348.82]  estate has gotten to the point where developers will just not sell things because it's actually
[348.82 --> 356.82]  more profitable to just build it and sit on it than it is to build it take a profit margin and sell it to
[356.82 --> 362.34]  someone to occupy especially when you can lease it while you sit on it and your profits go stonks
[362.34 --> 367.78]  yeah um like really really gpus they're now it's free they're free real estate except they cost money
[367.78 --> 378.74]  um putting this in even more context the rtx 3080 okay the 3080 had a 699 us dollar msrp when it first
[378.74 --> 384.10]  launched now there is one bit of extra information we have now that we didn't have before apparently
[384.10 --> 391.78]  the reason for it to have 12 gigs of dddr6 is that the 16 gigabit chips are more widely available
[391.78 --> 400.58]  although that sort of rings a little hollow when all of this stuff is basically unobtainium um yeah
[400.58 --> 406.42]  also those chips are the same ones used for the rtx 3060 and could have possibly been used for the rtx 3050
[406.42 --> 412.90]  though as we mentioned in our video it is quite possible that nvidia is utilizing chip like c uh gpu fab
[412.90 --> 422.66]  capacity that would not have been possible to use for an rtx 30 series card oh man so if you can get
[422.66 --> 429.94]  one performance will be a lot worse than an rtx 3060 um but it'll have a lot more memory and early
[429.94 --> 435.94]  reports indicate that the cards perform quite well for crypto uh right now because they're not late
[435.94 --> 443.94]  hash rate and get this conveniently whenever ethereum eventually moves to proof of stake yeah
[443.94 --> 450.58]  these will be ready oh wait no it's not the proof of stake change that requires more vram is it
[450.58 --> 454.50]  i forget i'm a little i'm a little rusty on the details whatever there's supposed to be an ethereum
[454.50 --> 460.34]  change at some point that made it require way more vram and this will be ready for it which kind of makes
[460.34 --> 465.62]  you wonder if nvidia just launched this to meet mining demand or if this has anything to do with meeting
[465.62 --> 474.74]  demand for gamers i seriously doubt the latter yeah okay yeah you're probably not going to get one
[474.74 --> 480.02]  anyways so yeah so that's at least you know it's launching at least you're up to date on the on the
[480.02 --> 488.10]  tech news there you go yeah we can't uh we can't problem yeah we okay minor problem in other tech news
[488.10 --> 494.26]  sort of gaming news the game awards awards awards to games and announces announcements um there's there's
[494.26 --> 498.02]  a bunch of stuff there's a bunch of announcements first i think we'd skip all of that and go to the
[498.02 --> 505.06]  awards yeah sure best game direction i'm skipping game of the year we'll talk about that at the end
[505.06 --> 512.34]  fine okay i i did not watch the game awards it's so funny i um i didn't either i i'm far enough removed
[512.34 --> 517.06]  from it now that i think it's probably fine to talk about this but you know how i was in an ad
[517.06 --> 520.42]  at the game awards i think it was either last year or the year before i can't remember
[520.42 --> 527.94]  um i was in a samsung tv like yeah like ad spot during the game awards okay and like it was super
[527.94 --> 532.50]  cool to be to be part of that um it was really cool the way we were able to throw it together in our
[532.50 --> 539.70]  studio and like shoot effectively an ad that aired during the game awards which is like my initial
[539.70 --> 549.06]  response was game awards sorry is that like a big deal or i have literally never in my life watched the
[549.06 --> 554.82]  game awards because i like my understanding is it's only been going on for like 10 years or so
[554.82 --> 562.34]  something like that how i think it's been a been a while um but but it has been a big deal for quite
[562.34 --> 568.34]  a while yeah but see that's the thing is i basically took 10 years off gaming right while i founded a
[568.34 --> 574.82]  company and had kids and didn't play any video games so established in 2014 yeah so it's only been around for
[574.82 --> 583.78]  seven years so i was just like um yeah game awards yeah i mean that sounds super cool and um it sounds
[583.78 --> 591.62]  good that's awesome um but i yeah i have i have i'm so sorry everyone i have literally never watched
[591.62 --> 596.26]  the game awards yeah jhoris says it's almost bigger than e3 at this point okay i know that e3 is irrelevant
[596.26 --> 602.34]  now but i didn't have time for e3 either we i think we attended e3 as a company once and i didn't go
[602.34 --> 605.94]  yeah and i determined it was a waste of time because i was the one that went yeah that was
[605.94 --> 610.10]  that was pretty funny you were because i think you were the one that pitched it to me yeah well the
[610.10 --> 614.66]  if we went the year before yeah it would have been awesome because there were like a console launch
[614.66 --> 618.34]  there were like two console launches the year before you went or something it wasn't even that
[618.34 --> 622.98]  there was actually a large amount of hardware companies that went and launched hardware there
[622.98 --> 628.10]  it was really weird and i was like okay if they're gonna do this again then we should be big and then we
[628.10 --> 632.02]  went and they didn't do it again because they probably went and decided it was a waste of time yeah
[632.02 --> 637.78]  right so that just a bit of a swing and a miss and then we never went back anyway so uh so i don't
[637.78 --> 642.34]  i don't have a ton of context for any of this other than that you're about to tell me who won the game
[642.34 --> 648.58]  awards this year yeah best game direction death loop have you ever heard of it um i think i've heard
[648.58 --> 652.82]  of definitely i was gonna say probably honestly the majority of people watching have yeah i haven't
[652.82 --> 660.34]  played it though pretty cool game concept i have not personally played it um but i can see why it could
[660.34 --> 668.18]  have won this category best action slash adventure game metroid dread okay i have also not played it
[668.18 --> 672.50]  yeah but the things that it's against i could definitely see it winning that cool what did it
[672.50 --> 678.26]  go up against uh that i think probably i don't know but i think probably its strongest competition
[678.26 --> 684.58]  would have been uh resident evil village okay there was a lot of kind of movement around that game i i
[684.58 --> 689.06]  would have if i saw this list without the winner highlighted i probably would have suspected it was that
[689.06 --> 693.86]  one uh marvel's guardian of the galaxy also actually looks like an actually well-made game
[693.86 --> 698.66]  which you probably would not expect given the name because most games that are made off of movies are
[698.66 --> 707.14]  not very great yeah um most anticipated game was elden ring who also won the most anticipated game of last
[707.14 --> 714.90]  year um last year's list of most anticipated games is almost identical to this year's list of most anticipated
[714.90 --> 720.82]  games cool um i mean hey the truth is the same winner games take a long time to develop okay it does
[720.82 --> 726.74]  they do it's it's it's very time consuming it's a lot of work yeah i'm really hyped for god of war
[726.74 --> 732.74]  ragnarok the previous god of war was amazing i did hear that i wasn't a fan of any of the god of wars
[732.74 --> 739.06]  before the remake yeah but have you ever owned a playstation no but that type of game i'm also not into
[739.06 --> 743.38]  right okay like there's games like that on xbox this one's more of like an adventure game it's really
[743.38 --> 752.90]  cool okay getting into the the finale best multiplayer game of the year it takes two oh so it's not game of
[752.90 --> 762.02]  the year it's also game of the year oh really we're doing multiplayer game first though so this happens to be
[762.02 --> 771.78]  the one like big release this year that i did play not true what whatever oh i played valheim yeah
[772.58 --> 778.26]  valheim came out this year i think so and it takes two beat valheim that's the really surprising to me
[778.26 --> 784.66]  it beat new world that should be a given new world's trash it beat back for blood that should be a given
[784.66 --> 789.86]  in my opinion just go play left for dead 2 uh it beat monster hunter rise i never played that it beat
[789.86 --> 796.02]  knockout city i legitimately don't know what that is but it beat valheim that is very stunning to me
[796.74 --> 805.54]  okay okay hold on a second float plane chat is not pleased fray says it takes two was an amazing game
[805.54 --> 812.74]  night pause says it takes two is a fantastic game to be fair all right one moment please it takes two
[812.74 --> 818.50]  to be fair all right one moment please it takes two is a beautiful game the environments the creativity that
[818.50 --> 835.30]  went into it are just outstanding but the story oh man spoiler alert okay you just keep chasing the mcguffin
[835.30 --> 845.78]  constantly it's just ah you have not come far enough yet i don't know what his accent is i i forget
[846.34 --> 851.94]  but have you played it no not yet we're going to but not yet really okay so here's the problem like
[851.94 --> 857.30]  own it and i've been waiting but anyways yeah here's the problem with it takes two is that if you are a
[857.30 --> 867.22]  a non-gamer the puzzles and the level design are probably pretty creative and or maybe even a little
[867.22 --> 875.70]  bit challenging but for me as like someone who's been playing video games since i was seven or whatever
[876.26 --> 885.70]  sitting on the couch next to my wife it's a little hard to stay engaged not yeah not uh to oh night pause
[885.70 --> 893.86]  i am not at the end yet either i have gotten extremely tired of collecting pages or collecting
[894.66 --> 903.78]  whatever's and because it's all just an excuse to and oh man the character development pacing is so
[905.14 --> 912.34]  bad like because they have to be they have to be okay again i said spoiler alert so i can talk about it
[912.34 --> 917.78]  so you've got this couple that are they're they're about to get divorced and their child is sad and
[917.78 --> 926.50]  wants them to get together and first of all as a child of um divorced parents i think that any kind
[926.50 --> 932.50]  of narrative that somehow puts it puts the responsibility on the child to do anything uh get
[932.50 --> 938.50]  their parents together uh take responsibility for splitting them up whatever it is um is sorry
[938.50 --> 947.62]  it it i thought it was stupid it was just it was just stupid um you know two adults who can't
[947.62 --> 952.82]  stand each other should not get back together because the child is sad because a toxic environment
[952.82 --> 959.46]  quite frankly is probably not any better yeah um so there's there's a lot of there's a lot of sort of
[959.46 --> 966.66]  i got baggage okay i got baggage anyway they start out kind of being sick of each other's bs
[966.66 --> 974.26]  she works all the time and he i don't know i forget what his sin is he he doesn't help out enough
[974.26 --> 981.38]  or something i i can't remember but the point is that though the kid is super sad and so there's this
[981.38 --> 987.30]  supernatural intervention that takes place where the two parents are turned into these uh these little
[987.30 --> 994.42]  doll representations of the the little kids toys and they have to go through this this journey of
[994.42 --> 1000.02]  reconciliation with each other where they learn to work together and they learn to cooperate and and
[1000.02 --> 1006.26]  build each other's um build each other's relationship or build their relationship back up
[1006.26 --> 1012.10]  and because you because you need to see that development like that character development
[1012.10 --> 1018.90]  as you go through each challenge they they like they learn to trust each other a little again and they
[1018.90 --> 1023.62]  they rediscover his passion for gardening please tell me there's a meter does the trust meter go up
[1024.90 --> 1030.42]  or they appreciate that she really does work really hard and that's her love language or or whatever it
[1030.42 --> 1035.94]  is and they make this progress and then they dump you back to this this npc who guides you through the
[1035.94 --> 1045.46]  process and they like immediately are back to full-on can't stand each other again and then it resets and
[1045.46 --> 1049.70]  then they like reconcile a bit again and then like immediately they're back to full-on can't stand each
[1049.70 --> 1058.02]  other again so it's this like the game can't decide how long it was supposed to be and in my opinion
[1058.58 --> 1067.78]  this is probably the only time in my uh this is probably the only time as a gamer ever where i've looked at
[1067.78 --> 1074.90]  a game and i've gone they had too much budget you know what i mean like you know how often it happens
[1074.90 --> 1078.50]  where you'll reach like the last third of a game you'll be like oh they ran out of time
[1079.06 --> 1084.10]  they ran out of budget yes that's definitely happened a lot whereas i think it takes two
[1084.10 --> 1092.10]  could have been an outstanding six to eight hour gaming experience right jam packed like a like a
[1092.10 --> 1098.74]  portal like experience ubisoft has that issue right now with like all their games but we've we've sat down
[1098.74 --> 1104.66]  i mean i i'd have to i'd have to check i actually don't know if origin has a log for how many hours you've
[1104.66 --> 1112.10]  put into a game i'm not 100 sure how i'd even check it but we have put more than that in and we're not
[1112.10 --> 1120.26]  done yet and um oh yeah right so jr 69 55 says it seems like a couple's therapy game so that's the other
[1120.26 --> 1130.74]  issue is it's so repetitive because the lessons are always the same lesson work together yeah
[1131.62 --> 1141.46]  i got it it's in the title of the game i know right so give me some new give me some new character
[1141.46 --> 1146.90]  development my main problem with the game is not have a sequel where they they decide to break up
[1146.90 --> 1156.02]  it takes only one or they could have a polyamorous sequel it takes many it takes three or more
[1157.46 --> 1166.02]  oh man so my issue is that while it's a beautiful game and it ran flawlessly i didn't have any technical
[1166.02 --> 1174.42]  bugs with it and i thought the voice acting was pretty solid like overall solid it has a terrible
[1174.42 --> 1180.50]  story it had it has a terrible story it has a basically non-existent story it falls into that trap
[1180.50 --> 1186.90]  of storytelling that goes and then this happened and then this happened and then this happened and
[1186.90 --> 1191.70]  then this happened and then this happened it's like right but what are the consequences what are what are
[1191.70 --> 1199.14]  the out what's the outcome where's the but then but then there was this crazy thing no it just is
[1199.14 --> 1206.10]  always the same thing you always do what the guy told you to do and you work together and each stage
[1206.10 --> 1212.02]  is like probably anywhere from half an hour to 90 minutes of gameplay and you get through it and it's like
[1213.62 --> 1217.46]  you need to work together some more and you're like
[1217.46 --> 1226.26]  could we have worked together enough to to do something and maybe the daughter does more than
[1227.06 --> 1234.02]  you know go around and see her sad mom sleeping on the couch or whatever and look like a creepy creepy
[1234.02 --> 1238.74]  uncanny valley wow how does she look so weird character um
[1240.58 --> 1245.38]  knock 23 says the game isn't aimed at linus the story follows a lot like a previous relationship i had
[1245.38 --> 1255.46]  well i mean it's not that i can't relate you know ivan and i've been together 15 years you think we
[1255.46 --> 1260.82]  never fought about anything you know you think we haven't drifted farther and drifting closer and
[1260.82 --> 1264.82]  child of divorce and we've actually had a lot of comments come in and saying like as a child of
[1264.82 --> 1271.78]  divorce this game just kind of pissed me off so um i don't know my parents are still chilling
[1271.78 --> 1278.34]  yeah you know what this is pretty good jr6955 says it's well i'm gonna paraphrase a little bit but
[1278.34 --> 1283.06]  it's like uh it's like it constantly teases you but you never finish you know so i haven't finished
[1283.06 --> 1290.18]  the game i never finished the game get your mind out of the gutter loop mind out of the gutter mind out
[1290.18 --> 1293.86]  of the gutter so i could back it maybe that has to be one of the story
[1293.86 --> 1302.18]  it's a problem anyways true scott says he hasn't reached the bring back this back in your relationship
[1302.18 --> 1308.10]  part yet that's the whole part that's the whole thing it's just the same thing over and over and
[1308.10 --> 1313.38]  over again is the multiplayer good to bring it all the way back to the award yes okay the co-opness
[1313.38 --> 1318.90]  is good jake's been in the chat he's like yeah i played it for half an hour with the gf um
[1318.90 --> 1325.94]  um they should have had difficulty tears it was way too easy for pretty much anyone that games like
[1326.50 --> 1333.06]  again i could i can enjoy it from a my wife is having fun and i'm spending time with her kind of
[1333.06 --> 1338.02]  perspective but the thing is that even though she's certainly not a hardcore gamer she's absolutely
[1338.02 --> 1343.70]  capable of playing hardcore games yeah like she can play left for dead team fortress 2 like we could
[1343.70 --> 1348.74]  sit and play an actual game together very divisive and overcooked which like sure it's a game about
[1348.74 --> 1354.10]  cooking but it's also like still a gamer game you said divisive i think you meant decisive decisive
[1354.10 --> 1359.46]  sure okay did you meant that she causes divisions on the team or i don't think that's what divisive
[1359.46 --> 1366.02]  means yeah it does okay i think you meant good at delegating or something like that um sure yeah okay
[1367.94 --> 1372.58]  to be clear i mean if you think she's divisive that's fine i just really don't think that was what
[1372.58 --> 1379.62]  you meant like causing causing rifts disagreements no yeah that's not yeah okay cool um so yeah like
[1379.62 --> 1384.02]  she can like she can play games that actually require skill but because she hasn't played a lot
[1384.02 --> 1391.06]  of adventure games she's still like enjoying the puzzles whereas i walk into a room or a boss battle
[1391.06 --> 1399.30]  and i see the glaring weak point and the the obvious sort of you know mechanism for it i'm like oh okay
[1399.30 --> 1405.30]  this right right yeah look for the glowing thing a game that i think did that and i've talked about it
[1405.30 --> 1411.22]  a million times but titanfall 2 the storyline is honestly really short i still need to play it but
[1411.22 --> 1416.98]  they never they never overuse any mechanics it's all it's there's a few times where i'm like man like
[1416.98 --> 1421.78]  i really wish i had that for longer but then at the same time if i had it for too long i probably
[1421.78 --> 1426.50]  wouldn't think the mechanic was as cool it takes two actually does that really well as well okay so
[1426.50 --> 1433.06]  each of the new stages issues you new gameplay mechanics that you then use to solve problems
[1433.06 --> 1439.78]  so they're not interesting enough they're interesting but the game is just too long okay the stages are too
[1439.78 --> 1446.18]  long and there are too many stages and there's not enough there's not a consistent character development
[1446.18 --> 1451.54]  that is taking place the way it feels and i could be totally wrong because i'm not an expert on the
[1451.54 --> 1460.42]  game development process but the way it feels to me is as though they set out with 10 or 15 or however
[1460.42 --> 1467.46]  many zones they are and they set out with 10 to 15 teams and said create unique gameplay elements
[1467.46 --> 1474.50]  and create a whole bunch of puzzles for people to solve and then they just put them all in an order
[1474.50 --> 1479.70]  that kind of felt good and so that's why you're going through this develop develop belt back to zero
[1479.70 --> 1484.82]  develop develop belt back to zero it's like playing zelda games it's like playing all the zelda games
[1484.82 --> 1489.86]  back to back to back to back to back to back where for whatever reason from one moment to the next link
[1489.86 --> 1495.94]  suddenly has amnesia and lost all of it and you're starting over again and it really just feels like
[1495.94 --> 1503.94]  that i'm talking about it takes two okay so just within the confines of the best multiplayer game
[1503.94 --> 1511.62]  award do you have any problems with that best multiplayer game multiplayer so here's an interesting
[1511.62 --> 1519.38]  conversation um you know one of the things that i noticed about youtuber awards for example is that
[1519.38 --> 1527.46]  uh mr beast has won creator of the year twice in a row sure i don't disagree so why can't a game
[1527.46 --> 1533.38]  win multiplayer game of the year twice in a row especially when you consider how game development
[1533.38 --> 1541.46]  has changed we don't get unless you're ea we don't get just a new edition with a new year number tacked
[1541.46 --> 1547.78]  on to the end of it of fundamentally you know that genre every year i think it would have to be evaluated
[1547.78 --> 1551.94]  on the changes that happen to that game so if that if in my opinion if that game was still under heavy
[1551.94 --> 1558.58]  development sure so how about this let's take um let's take a game like okay you and i were have
[1558.58 --> 1564.58]  both been talking about how incredible it is that anno 1800 is still in active development four years
[1564.58 --> 1572.26]  after release and not just not just like hey we added a new horse armor that you can buy yeah like since
[1572.26 --> 1577.54]  the game originally exciting updates since the game originally launched with two regions so there's the
[1577.54 --> 1586.66]  old world and the new world they have since added the nbisa region the arctic region a shed load more
[1586.66 --> 1594.82]  uh resident classes um like uh building types and not just building types but like fundamental changes
[1594.82 --> 1600.34]  to the way that you that you build your your cities and develop your trade they've like like they've
[1600.34 --> 1607.38]  they've really really changed the game uh a lot and in positive ways i think i can't think of a
[1607.38 --> 1612.66]  an update other than potentially that one character i can't think of an update that like isn't cool
[1613.54 --> 1619.70]  the anarchist yeah that's the only one that i'm like yeah that character is sort of yeah i finally
[1619.70 --> 1624.10]  figured out how you get rid of his minds so we can talk about that later because we thought there was
[1624.10 --> 1633.06]  just this kind of like unassailable npc but you actually can do stuff okay so so yeah multiplayer
[1633.06 --> 1644.90]  game yeah um so the options are back for blood it takes two knockout city monster hunter rise new
[1644.90 --> 1648.90]  world valheim i know you're not gonna be able to comment on essentially any of those except for maybe
[1648.90 --> 1656.34]  valheim valheim i mean was really awesome when i played it but i could see going for something a
[1656.34 --> 1663.30]  little more lowest common denominator or maybe unique uh it takes two is an only co-op experience right
[1663.30 --> 1668.02]  yes yeah yeah there's not that many of those games they exist but there's not that many of those games
[1668.02 --> 1672.82]  people are like that award exists it's called best ongoing game right but what i'm saying is that with
[1672.82 --> 1678.10]  the way that games get developed like you look at i mean i wouldn't i don't know if it was the first
[1678.10 --> 1688.66]  one but wow certainly mainstreamized it releasing a game once and then updating it and at sometimes
[1688.66 --> 1695.86]  actually making it better and other times usually not not as much that's and that's fair criticism so
[1695.86 --> 1702.02]  you'd obviously have to legitimately make your game the best game again but i just i i don't know i
[1702.02 --> 1707.86]  don't really see a reason why you couldn't say you know what this particular game amazing
[1707.86 --> 1712.90]  uh yeah yeah conrad says final fantasy 14 literally won an award and that's super cool i just don't
[1712.90 --> 1718.58]  see why you have to specifically carve out an ongoing game award i just don't see why you wouldn't just
[1718.58 --> 1725.62]  say okay yeah in this genre this happens to still be the best the best game i'd be okay with that yeah
[1725.62 --> 1732.18]  anyways um then moving on to the final one is game of the year the contenders were death loop it takes two
[1732.74 --> 1738.82]  metroid dread psychonauts 2 ratchet and clank rift apart and resident evil village even how much
[1738.82 --> 1742.98]  everyone loved ratchet and clank i honestly i haven't played it again i don't have a playstation
[1742.98 --> 1747.46]  so i haven't played it but the feedback for a lot of these games was actually quite positive like
[1747.46 --> 1755.30]  overwhelmingly positive i think yeah um yeah i don't know i don't have anything more to say about it
[1755.30 --> 1760.66]  quite frankly i just i didn't i didn't play the other games so i can't really comment all i can say
[1760.66 --> 1768.82]  is that it takes two is a cool game but i have a really hard time accepting it as the best game
[1769.46 --> 1776.34]  if that makes sense yeah it it was a risk-taking game and i could absolutely see it winning some kind
[1776.34 --> 1783.06]  of award sure i think it's really cool that pc gaming is finally getting couch co-op experiences that
[1783.06 --> 1789.14]  were really built for couch co-op instead of having it tacked on as an afterthought yeah but
[1791.46 --> 1797.78]  i uh yeah i i just i i don't know i i game of the year i just i have such a hard time with beautiful
[1797.78 --> 1803.78]  beautiful game i just i i don't feel compelled to finish it i yeah i'd kind of argue this wasn't
[1803.78 --> 1808.90]  exactly the the absolute strongest year ever yeah that's fair i mean i think if breath of the wild came
[1808.90 --> 1813.38]  out this year we'd probably be looking at a different outcome but yeah and and a lot of
[1813.38 --> 1818.58]  the strong releases of this year came out like right now which is kind of hard to include in an
[1818.58 --> 1823.86]  award show that happened right now yeah maybe if halo infinite had come out when it was supposed to
[1823.86 --> 1828.98]  come out they would have had a shot at it and if it had co-op baked yeah like was what it was supposed
[1828.98 --> 1832.98]  to be when it was supposed to be that might have worked out pretty well for them and they i i wouldn't
[1832.98 --> 1837.54]  be surprised if there was some concerns about giving an award to a game that has so much backlash because
[1837.54 --> 1840.98]  there is a huge amount of backlash over the cosmetic system and all this kind of stuff and
[1840.98 --> 1846.58]  is there oh yeah as someone who has completely ignored it it hasn't been bothering me i i checked
[1846.58 --> 1854.42]  out the halo subreddit once and went whoa and then kind of laughed and left because it was so negative
[1854.42 --> 1858.02]  everyone that i talked to about halo was like yeah that's really fun when you go on the halo subreddit
[1858.02 --> 1867.14]  it's just hatred i'm like okay it's almost like you know communities that have been have
[1867.14 --> 1875.54]  become so jaded and so cynical just don't even want a w anymore yeah i don't know i've been i've been
[1875.54 --> 1885.22]  having fun argue like i part of it is that i haven't touched a halo game since halo 2 yeah and i only
[1885.22 --> 1891.46]  really played halo 1 so you know for me everything's fresh oh wow this is so new wow this has gotten a
[1891.46 --> 1902.02]  a lot better what are all these guns um i jaden refunded the campaign because he has a 1080 and
[1902.02 --> 1906.74]  he's having serious performance issues with a 1080 with a 1080 he sure as heck won't be buying anything
[1906.74 --> 1913.54]  higher end than a 1080 these days i mean man i don't i'm not i haven't like dove into it or anything but
[1913.54 --> 1918.18]  yeah he refunded it because he found it unplayable like even 1080s are worth like are they worth like five
[1918.18 --> 1921.94]  six hundred dollars still or something stupid like that it's not a cheap card right now yeah it's not
[1921.94 --> 1926.74]  a good time to upgrade conrad says it's fantastic most people that i've heard from have said it's
[1926.74 --> 1933.62]  fantastic jaden as far as i know liked it a lot but then when it was like in like contained corridors
[1933.62 --> 1937.62]  and stuff and then it became open world and it was just unplayable i've heard there's performance
[1937.62 --> 1943.62]  issues on the consoles out in the open world uh in the open world parts as well makes sense uh but i'm
[1943.62 --> 1951.38]  my my brother asked me to wait oh you know what i was about to ask you to wait yes yeah i was gonna
[1951.38 --> 1955.54]  i was gonna say yeah we should just wait and co-op it yeah i haven't played yet that's that's my
[1955.54 --> 1959.78]  current plan is i'm waiting for co-op to open up yeah probably gonna end up playing co-op with like
[1959.78 --> 1964.18]  a bunch of different people yeah and that sounds great yeah but i don't yeah i don't think i want
[1964.18 --> 1970.58]  to play it single player i never really played halo single player well it's because you had an xbox
[1970.58 --> 1975.94]  that's true i played it single player because the pc version of halo one didn't have co-op
[1977.06 --> 1982.42]  yeah but like i always i don't know yeah i had it on xbox and i always played it halo 1 and halo 2
[1982.90 --> 1988.10]  and halo 3 a little bit but mostly the one and halo 2 um i played with my dad or my brother or
[1988.10 --> 1992.50]  my friends or whatever i never really played halo alone so playing halo look at this guy flexing his
[1992.50 --> 1997.06]  xbox and his friends growing up and the fact that his parents took an interest in video games with
[1997.06 --> 2004.74]  him luke could you like could you attack me more hey man we we can play when it when co-op comes out
[2004.74 --> 2009.78]  okay all right after it gets delayed three times all right we'll play we'll play in 2023 yeah 2023 no

[2139.30 --> 2151.86]  quiz for each other oh okay okay all right all right yeah wow this is very judgmental yeah wow um tech
[2151.86 --> 2160.50]  snobbery 10. style you say what the heck is tech style hmm i feel like i have none of it oh no someone
[2160.50 --> 2166.02]  has hacked your friend's computer and their files and this is hilarious their files and data are about
[2166.02 --> 2172.10]  to be published all over social media what do they do oh man this is great i can't wait to i can't wait
[2172.10 --> 2184.74]  what do they do what do they do oh wow should i answer this honestly uh i don't know man it's up to you
[2185.78 --> 2193.54]  oh okay i'm just gonna answer it as honestly as i can so old it takes 30 seconds to open an app the battery
[2193.54 --> 2204.50]  last only 10 minutes from a full charge where do they look for a new phone um okay
[2208.82 --> 2209.62]  oh man
[2212.34 --> 2213.22]  oh man
[2215.78 --> 2222.10]  sure yep omg your friend's house is on fire don't worry the pets are safe it looks like they only have time
[2222.10 --> 2234.26]  to rescue their phone and one other device which do they take oh man uh oh man
[2239.22 --> 2245.78]  yeah i'm gonna go with this one okay we think your friend would like wow this is a really really bad
[2245.78 --> 2252.02]  suggestion um okay are you almost done i'm almost done yeah okay i'm gonna have to hear your
[2252.02 --> 2253.46]  answers this is hilarious
[2259.22 --> 2264.74]  are you still on question three luke yeah i all the answers sucked no i don't think you would do
[2264.74 --> 2271.22]  like i don't think any of those like correctly apply to you at all anyways um okay all right well i'm
[2271.22 --> 2278.18]  gonna talk through um what it suggested for luke we think your friend would like an anchor 622 magnetic
[2278.18 --> 2286.58]  battery uh mag go it appears to be like an iphone magsafe battery that also acts as a stand
[2288.34 --> 2295.22]  did it suggest the same bloody thing to both of us okay what were your answers can we go back through
[2295.22 --> 2299.46]  the quiz i didn't even like them like i i feel like you're gonna be like no it should have been
[2299.46 --> 2302.82]  something else and i'll be like yeah you're probably right because like a lot of them i don't think
[2302.82 --> 2308.10]  apply how do we go back uh you can't oh you just do it again so i said your tech addiction was pretty
[2308.10 --> 2312.98]  strong your technology was not quite as strong i had you had a two for tech snobbery and a one for
[2312.98 --> 2318.34]  textile those are probably both fine yeah realistically i did 10 10 10
[2318.34 --> 2326.58]  three or four yeah okay so for thanks so for the someone hacked your friend's computer um i put that
[2326.58 --> 2334.58]  you would uh okay next hack the hacker and steal their picks in retaliation okay and what did you say
[2334.58 --> 2339.70]  uh i said calmly contact customer service and the authorities and hope they can stop it yeah okay yeah
[2339.70 --> 2344.82]  i wouldn't i wouldn't have any illusions that they can stop it but no but that's sort of what we've
[2344.82 --> 2351.22]  we've tried to because there was the twitter thing forever ago right yeah so i thought back to
[2351.22 --> 2356.26]  i did contact the authorities yeah in that case it was because like they could do something so it
[2356.26 --> 2360.50]  wasn't directly yeah yes i wasn't like directly answering the question but like this is as close
[2360.50 --> 2364.26]  as i can get your friend's phone is so old it takes 30 seconds to open an app and the battery lasts
[2364.26 --> 2369.54]  10 minutes i said who cares if it has a screen and fits in their pocket that's enough that's probably
[2369.54 --> 2374.58]  accurate i said they've been waiting for the new snapdragon chip for a year no i think that i think
[2374.58 --> 2379.06]  that's pretty fair yeah for vr headsets are now so advanced you can't tell the difference and
[2379.06 --> 2382.50]  everyone has one how does your friend use theirs i put that you'd hack it and use it to emulate nest
[2382.50 --> 2387.78]  games nice nice does that does that seem like the closest one no i probably do fight aliens in a
[2387.78 --> 2391.86]  distant galaxy i don't know okay i was memeing a little bit because i feel like nest games in vr would
[2391.86 --> 2397.06]  just kind of be terrible you'd still do it at least once yeah that's true so my answer was not wrong
[2397.06 --> 2404.98]  it just wasn't that's the most right i i said number one yeah i mean if they're not more like
[2404.98 --> 2411.06]  blocks in distant galaxies yeah because that's the only thing i fight in vr is yeah i just i looked at
[2411.06 --> 2414.66]  the other ones i'll say he's not gonna use this as a doorstop yeah i don't think he's gonna use it to
[2414.66 --> 2420.26]  work with others in vr environments like that's not a thing i strongly prefer for for a technophile i
[2420.82 --> 2425.86]  strongly prefer in person yeah like i feel like four would be the most wrong like i it's it's a really
[2425.86 --> 2431.70]  funny thing i'll be i'll be traveling right and this even goes like before my most recent trip
[2431.70 --> 2437.94]  i'll be traveling and uh my wife will call me at like you know kind of close to bedtime she'll be like
[2437.94 --> 2442.10]  hey do you want to say good night to the kids and have a video call i'm like no not really
[2444.42 --> 2450.50]  i want to see i i don't like i don't like talking to people on the phone i don't like talking to people
[2450.50 --> 2458.98]  on video chat at the same time though it's very good i feel like it's a needed thing in some yeah
[2458.98 --> 2464.10]  for sure but it's just it's not my jam if i can avoid it i would i would realistically if someone
[2464.10 --> 2471.30]  moved too far away i would just fall out of contact with them i i know i know i i sound like i sound like
[2471.30 --> 2477.78]  a heartless heartless b-word but i just i i just i'm not i'm not i mean that's a reality that happens
[2477.78 --> 2480.58]  with a lot of people so being honest about it i don't think it's negative i'm not going to get on
[2480.58 --> 2487.14]  a video call with you every every saturday and be like hey i'm the same type of person i'm sorry i
[2487.14 --> 2492.50]  just yeah you you moved i didn't move and it means it means nothing nothing personal right yeah yeah
[2492.50 --> 2497.46]  it's just not how it's just it's just not my jam yeah and question four the unfortunate thing about
[2497.46 --> 2506.10]  question four is they didn't have an answer that was my data i would run for my server yeah 100 that is
[2506.10 --> 2510.50]  the only thing in my house that has in fact i wouldn't even bother with my phone what i need
[2510.50 --> 2516.10]  my phone for i would run straight for the server and i would try and rip as many drives out of it as
[2516.10 --> 2522.58]  i can so what did you put for me for you i put you've got it stored in an expensive protective case
[2522.58 --> 2527.70]  so you can just grab that i i kind of like it was a bit of a throwaway it was a bit of a throwaway
[2527.70 --> 2532.98]  because it was kind of like oh well he's probably you know got his data backed up and doesn't care about
[2532.98 --> 2537.86]  anything yeah i i had the exact same reaction to this i almost clicked on the protective case one
[2537.86 --> 2543.62]  for the exact same reason that you did the one that i selected was their smart watch because it said
[2544.26 --> 2549.22]  uh what's the point of being alive if they don't have the data to prove it and i was like the only
[2549.22 --> 2555.30]  thing he would save is the data so it wasn't about the smartwatch right i was just like none of these
[2555.94 --> 2562.66]  there's no way he's gonna grab his ps5 he wouldn't waste any amount of time doing that so that's dumb i don't
[2562.66 --> 2567.46]  even have one i know he doesn't have anything stored in an expensive protective case so i'm
[2567.46 --> 2573.38]  not i thought about like maybe that's enough of a whatever but i didn't bother and then like they're
[2573.38 --> 2579.22]  nothing i'm like well he's not gonna grab nothing either yeah so i don't yeah i just remember that
[2579.22 --> 2585.46]  thing so i did take the quiz again oops yeah put in different information i got something else in
[2585.46 --> 2591.14]  conclusion oh did you okay yes this this the stream is brought to you by anchor give the gift of of anchor
[2591.14 --> 2594.42]  power products just because it didn't get the recommendation right for us doesn't mean they
[2594.42 --> 2598.90]  don't have lots of good products so go check it out try the quiz and all that good stuff okay jake
[2598.90 --> 2606.82]  i've actually done it twice now jake is gonna flip if we don't eventually show the pictures oh yes we've
[2606.82 --> 2612.98]  got pictures of the lab this is gonna be pretty freaking cool don't worry jake i wasn't ignoring you we
[2612.98 --> 2617.06]  were gonna get to it we were gonna get to it i know i know you're petty like that maybe i'll delete the
[2617.06 --> 2625.78]  photos you wouldn't you wouldn't so guys the reno the reno of the lab is almost done because we were
[2625.78 --> 2631.54]  keeping it keeping it pretty simple keeping it pretty simple here so we've got uh some fresh paint
[2631.54 --> 2639.38]  on the walls we've got some fresh access control going on we've got uh fresh security cameras in there
[2639.38 --> 2645.94]  got that ubiquity goodness what else we got going on here oh i think this is more of the uh that this is
[2645.94 --> 2653.30]  probably poe for the access control i'm guessing it's sound oh yeah yeah yeah we'll we'll show that
[2653.30 --> 2657.62]  we'll show that we're just in the front entryway kalan and we haven't gotten that far yet uh the
[2657.62 --> 2663.22]  floors i think we decided are we changing the carpet downstairs no we're just leaving it we're just
[2663.22 --> 2669.62]  redoing the stairway just the stairwell yeah the stairwell carpet is shockingly ugly yeah so this room
[2669.62 --> 2676.10]  no longer looks so oppressive anymore which is which is nice fortunately whoever was in here
[2676.10 --> 2682.26]  before actually did a lot of power and networking stuff that we just now don't have to do that's what
[2682.26 --> 2687.22]  i said oh jake says that's the oh that's the fiber run oh that's what you're talking about yeah i said
[2687.22 --> 2693.22]  that earlier i said yeah so uh this is where the fiber terminates oh this is where the d mark is okay
[2693.22 --> 2698.18]  so we got fiber into the building uh this is where it was run to so we would have had to have our
[2698.18 --> 2702.58]  networking equipment just sitting right in the front entryway which would have been really stupid
[2702.58 --> 2711.62]  so uh jake and the boys um they what what what it what what is this did you guys just you didn't
[2711.62 --> 2716.26]  splice it or anything right it's just like a coupler i think they just coupled it and then they ran it
[2716.26 --> 2721.38]  over somewhere else we'll see that in a little bit so it kind of runs above us in fact i think it runs
[2721.38 --> 2726.58]  along this cable management line right here uh so they painted i believe the ceiling might have been
[2726.58 --> 2731.86]  already black in here but they painted the wall so it looks a lot nicer in here and then out in the
[2731.86 --> 2738.34]  uh in like the warehouse and what will actually be the lab um we painted so looks a lot nicer in terms
[2738.34 --> 2744.90]  of like colors you guys won't see this part above but what you will do is you will hear it yeah uh we
[2744.90 --> 2751.54]  used the same like cellulose spray or something very similar to what we did what we coded our existing
[2751.54 --> 2757.14]  studio with and man does it ever make a difference even without any of the equipment in there you can
[2757.14 --> 2763.30]  actually carry on a conversation now instead of it just being like a ridiculous amount of reverb to
[2763.30 --> 2769.86]  the point where you can barely understand your own your own voice um here's this from the alternate
[2769.86 --> 2775.14]  angle yeah it was it was really bad i like the orange accent by the way yeah right even though it's
[2775.14 --> 2779.46]  just like a little splash i think it's good yeah i just want it to have a little bit of ltt you know
[2779.46 --> 2784.58]  yeah yeah um yvonne did the actual color scheme i was like hey i just want like a little bit of
[2785.30 --> 2791.62]  orange and kind of grays and dark colors kind of thing yeah and she made it she made it happen
[2791.62 --> 2796.18]  that's good stuff so yeah it looks awesome um goes all the way over here over by the door
[2799.06 --> 2804.02]  uh okay yeah there you go let's see if we're heading upstairs yeah there you go so the paint
[2804.02 --> 2809.06]  upstairs makes this part look a lot nicer as well one of the things i noticed when i was up in this room
[2809.06 --> 2816.50]  today is that the hvac is crazy loud in this room so if we were going to have any hopes of doing
[2816.50 --> 2824.66]  anything acoustic related inside the office space i think we might just um need to give up on that it's
[2825.38 --> 2829.78]  super loud part of the problem though might be that they've got it running full tilt right now
[2829.78 --> 2837.86]  because uh part of the curing process for that um insulating and acoustic spray is that it off gases a
[2837.86 --> 2844.02]  lot of crap so you want it just yeah pumping everything out of there yeah um what you well
[2844.02 --> 2851.54]  what you want ideally is you want um you want to do it in the summer you want to open up your bay door
[2851.54 --> 2858.74]  and you want just hot air circulating yeah pumping uh jake says the furnace is like right there the hvac
[2858.74 --> 2863.54]  probably gonna have to be boxed yeah we'll figure all that stuff out though give us time here's our sick
[2863.54 --> 2869.62]  sick sick networking closet by the way great job of the cable management jake it looks gorgeous
[2869.62 --> 2874.42]  gorgeous i actually don't think he did most of it i think most of it was one of our new guys who is
[2874.42 --> 2881.30]  still on probation so um yeah i shouldn't give maybe shouldn't give maybe jake too much credit for the
[2881.30 --> 2885.86]  little nitty-gritty details there's some comments in the chat that that little balcony thing
[2885.86 --> 2891.06]  um with the with the little hobbit door below it uh you have a fire pole
[2892.50 --> 2899.06]  hmm so the problem with that idea i mean aside from it being stupid is that um
[2901.06 --> 2907.94]  it's stupid okay what else do i need no there's like insurance problems yeah it's really it's really
[2907.94 --> 2911.86]  not going to be a thing it's not going to be a thing jake says i replaced the cables with small patch
[2911.86 --> 2919.54]  cables by the way jake i saw the green patch cables that you got for the pink rack i'm not sure if i
[2919.54 --> 2924.42]  was supposed to see those yet but i saw the box of them and i'm extremely excited so we're gonna have
[2924.42 --> 2929.54]  the uh like the mesh front door the pink mesh front door and then there's gonna be just like green patch
[2929.54 --> 2935.78]  cables behind it it's gonna be freaking awesome nice yeah i'm super excited uh what else we got for
[2935.78 --> 2941.62]  topics today is there is there really anything else to talk about the matrix gets an unreal engine 5
[2941.62 --> 2947.78]  experience on consoles so epic surprised everyone with a showcase of ue5 called the matrix awakened
[2947.78 --> 2955.38]  during the game awards digital foundry is very impressed which is a good sign yep uh so i mean
[2955.38 --> 2959.38]  just to be clear it's not a game it's a tech demo but there is a little bit of gameplay a little bit of
[2959.38 --> 2968.26]  exploration and uh it's the most unreal engine 5 that anyone's been able to actually try so um it's
[2968.26 --> 2974.42]  sort of a showcase kind of like that rock lumen demo thing from may of last year but it looks
[2975.22 --> 2983.46]  pretty freaking incredible yeah looks pretty amazing uh i don't know if i'm allowed to
[2984.34 --> 2989.30]  show it am i gonna get is this stupid video gonna get claimed if i try to show it definitely might
[2989.30 --> 2994.18]  yeah maybe just go look it up yourself yeah go look it up yourself super cool though uh
[2994.18 --> 3002.34]  yeah yeah i'm just we're just not gonna we're just not gonna do it uh and what else we got here
[3002.34 --> 3009.22]  today lab renovation ubisoft nft thing oh do we really have to talk about it no no let's do it let's
[3009.22 --> 3014.82]  do it let's do it hit me the trailer for ubisoft's nft cosmetic system quartz got so many dislikes it was
[3014.82 --> 3021.22]  unlisted uh the trailer went up on december 7th and the first supposed game will be ghost recon breakpoint
[3021.22 --> 3028.10]  uh it was later delisted the video that is uh but the link is still around the because i mean it's
[3028.10 --> 3032.82]  unlisted so as long as you have the link you can find it they're the first major publisher to go live
[3032.82 --> 3039.30]  with an nft system basically every cosmetic is a unique digit with a serial number attached to it
[3039.30 --> 3045.46]  which is engraved on the cosmetic item there will be limited edition quartz cosmetics uh there's metadata
[3045.46 --> 3051.14]  belonging to each cosmetic will which will have the previous owner history uh you can obtain your
[3051.14 --> 3058.82]  favorite streamers used cosmetics at exorbitant prices nice just in case uh underpants were out of
[3058.82 --> 3066.10]  fashion the baby water the yeah the beta for quartz has already started in select countries and you can
[3066.10 --> 3074.26]  check it out at uh i mean if you want at quartz.ubisoft.com full rollout starts in 2022. and uh the
[3074.26 --> 3079.46]  announcement was super popular you can see that it's got oh actually you can't see anything of the sort
[3079.46 --> 3085.14]  because our window is in front of it uh one moment please nope you still can't uh scroll down
[3087.14 --> 3099.62]  oh lordy it got 228 000 views okay and one and a half thousand thumbs up wow that must be a really
[3099.62 --> 3106.74]  really popular popular announcement that they made and it's so useful that we don't have a way to
[3106.74 --> 3114.34]  uh we don't have a way to you know express our displeasure in a way that brands actually suffer for
[3115.70 --> 3126.18]  um except we kind of still do so if you get the return youtube dislike chrome extension boop
[3126.18 --> 3128.42]  boop boop boop boop boop boop
[3128.42 --> 3137.38]  and i'm not going to turn on sync you can actually i believe i believe it still works until like two
[3137.38 --> 3143.06]  days from now no it doesn't seem to be oh yeah there we go there we go the bar is here 39 000 dislikes
[3143.06 --> 3152.26]  whoo so this is the big problem this is the big problem is that when youtube removed the dislike button
[3152.26 --> 3158.02]  and it's going to happen so i think december 12th is the drop dead date for removing api access to
[3158.02 --> 3163.30]  dislikes is that something like that yeah i think it's coming up quick it's coming up real quick these
[3163.30 --> 3169.06]  kinds when that happens these kinds of extensions and these kinds of workarounds are going to go away
[3169.06 --> 3174.74]  they will not work anymore and you will have no way of knowing looking at this video how nearly
[3174.74 --> 3183.14]  universally unpopular this move is um and this i don't you know i don't want to i don't want to
[3183.14 --> 3189.46]  belabor the point but i think this is such a perfect example of the kind of stuff that is going to be
[3189.46 --> 3198.26]  so much easier to get away with and that seems to indicate youtube's at least um secondary motive
[3198.26 --> 3207.78]  for making this move because in a big surprise move youtube is bringing back a rewind replacement
[3207.78 --> 3213.78]  of sorts it's not going to be called rewind stream right because i think they would be crazy to call
[3213.78 --> 3220.42]  something rewind at this point but i can tell you right now it sounds honestly kind of cringe of course
[3220.42 --> 3228.18]  it does so here's how it's going to work it's a live interactive stream on december the
[3228.18 --> 3236.82]  16th conveniently gonna be a live chat four days after the dislike button goes away ah good totally
[3236.82 --> 3245.30]  a coincidence luke and using the live chat users will participate in challenges based on trends from
[3245.30 --> 3254.02]  this year get involved in real-time experience and answer trivia questions when viewers compete complete
[3254.02 --> 3260.50]  all the challenges they'll be able to watch a musical performance from a mystery guest oh
[3264.66 --> 3274.26]  that reward is is that the most try hard that you have heard all year ah if if the the the thing that
[3274.26 --> 3283.70]  i'm trying to think about is like if steam did a thing where they were like okay we're gonna have an
[3283.70 --> 3289.14]  event there's a bunch of challenge things you can do and if you do them some cool thing will happen
[3289.14 --> 3295.94]  but you don't know what it is i might partake but because it's youtube i i hate it but it's not
[3295.94 --> 3301.86]  even i don't know how fair that is it just is probably going to be awful oh yeah they've got
[3301.86 --> 3307.38]  some good guests apparently bts is going to be on there so surprise that's who i assumed the reward
[3307.38 --> 3314.58]  was going to be um and many popular youtubers will appear including mark rober so that's cool nice but
[3314.58 --> 3323.94]  i just do not foresee any possible way that this will be anything other than cringe it's called escape 2021
[3323.94 --> 3336.10]  uh yeah something like that so i basically my point is it it this really this really throws youtube's
[3336.10 --> 3344.02]  intentions into question um just with this very suspicious timing yeah i know that they were working
[3344.02 --> 3350.10]  on this for quite some time but this just really does not look like an accident and then that ubisoft
[3350.10 --> 3358.10]  thing is an example of public pressure which is one of the only ways that we can affect any kind of
[3358.10 --> 3365.70]  change in our corporate over overlords public pressure caused ubisoft to at least be ashamed enough of this
[3365.70 --> 3374.10]  concept for now to pull the video to unlisted and this is the end of it in two days you will no longer
[3374.10 --> 3380.66]  have any ability to push back all they'll have to do is disable comments or moderate the comments
[3380.66 --> 3386.66]  which is more likely and people coming along this let's say let's say impressionable young people who
[3386.66 --> 3393.06]  don't sort of fundamentally understand how stupid and potentially exploitative this concept is oh yeah
[3393.06 --> 3401.06]  will have no idea how horrible it is like more transparency is always better and you should always
[3401.06 --> 3406.26]  be outraged when transparency is being pulled away from you there's also creators that will just i don't
[3406.26 --> 3410.58]  even know what it's called favorite or whatever it shows the creator's circle thing in a heart
[3410.58 --> 3415.14]  yeah and it puts it at the top there's creators that will just like bomb their own videos with those
[3415.86 --> 3421.30]  they'll just heart like every single positive or neutral comment and there's so many of them that
[3421.30 --> 3424.10]  it takes forever to scroll through it scroll through it scroll through it scroll through it you'll never
[3424.10 --> 3431.38]  really find the negative ones so yeah i'm really frustrated um
[3434.34 --> 3441.38]  there's another oh there's another issue uh oh no sorry ryan 77 627 says hey not exactly the
[3441.38 --> 3446.58]  extension will switch to cached slash estimated versions of dislikes once the api is fully deprecated
[3446.58 --> 3451.46]  it will not be as accurate but it will certainly give a number there's a lot of videos that launch on
[3451.46 --> 3456.18]  youtube every day and a big part of the problem is product launches from companies yeah which that
[3456.18 --> 3460.82]  won't matter for i i brought that up last week i think that is very cool and honestly in a lot of
[3460.82 --> 3466.02]  ways i think that is very important and there's ways that you can contribute and help those programs so
[3466.02 --> 3476.66]  if you want to go do it um but it is extremely far from solving the problem uh jake i actually was not
[3476.66 --> 3481.94]  following this apparently there's a zero day that originated from minecraft servers that caused a huge
[3481.94 --> 3485.62]  poo storm do you have any more details on this no i don't actually um
[3487.70 --> 3494.18]  i i heard people talking about it during the show yeah yeah i i'm seeing articles from like six hours
[3494.18 --> 3499.22]  ago i wouldn't have heard about this got it i cassie says i wonder when linus is going to release his
[3499.22 --> 3504.58]  book i have made basically zero progress on it i haven't touched it since the last time we talked
[3504.58 --> 3510.98]  about it which was i think when wansho was in office pre-lockdown so that should give you some
[3510.98 --> 3516.42]  idea i mean realistically i don't think my book would be worth reading until i've bowed out of the
[3516.42 --> 3526.26]  industry and i'm ready to just go tell all on it so yeah probably not anytime soon uh wow i don't know
[3526.26 --> 3531.06]  about you but i have not been on the ball on the incoming merch messages i've done some of them but i keep
[3531.06 --> 3538.26]  forgetting yeah so how soon will it be where we can just click show even after the thing expires and
[3538.26 --> 3543.94]  it can just show it but that doesn't really work because right now it's it shows it without a message
[3543.94 --> 3551.30]  when it expires oh uh what if we just showed it again i mean because that would be a lot better than
[3551.30 --> 3558.58]  having to like directly address bananas for the boys from ryan bananas for the boys what do you
[3558.58 --> 3564.90]  mean you don't want to address that come on oh not really come on not really all right is there
[3564.90 --> 3569.30]  anything else to talk about other than i'm sure conrad could find a way to make that ubisoft crap
[3570.50 --> 3576.34]  uh i guess that's it no all right cool let's do some merch messages yeah uh for those of you who are
[3576.34 --> 3582.82]  leaving super chats you guys are doing it wrong merch messages are the way to send paid messages
[3582.82 --> 3588.66]  to the show because that way at least if we don't get to your message you still get your order hey
[3589.22 --> 3596.82]  there's no way for us to lose also and it functions super chats are broken and you know i don't want to i
[3596.82 --> 3601.30]  don't want to throw anyone under the bus because they're really trying to help but the workaround that
[3601.30 --> 3608.10]  i was offered for it was you know okay what's the saying when the cure is worse than the disease
[3608.10 --> 3612.82]  yeah i don't i don't know what it is but yeah yeah i i just really don't think it made a ton of sense so
[3612.82 --> 3617.22]  super chats unless i happen to remember to click the viewer activity tab right at the beginning of the
[3617.22 --> 3623.38]  show are still broken for me so what you really need to do send a merch message you go to lttstore.com
[3623.38 --> 3627.78]  check out some cool stuff we got we got toques we got water bottles we got northern lights desk pads
[3627.78 --> 3633.30]  we've got hoodies we've got t-shirts we've got the party shirt we've got all kinds of good stuff
[3633.30 --> 3637.62]  over there and then in the checkout you can leave a little message and it'll pop up on the show
[3637.62 --> 3643.62]  assuming that luke and i managed to actually see the there is another thing to talk about by the way
[3643.62 --> 3648.26]  oh what is it the uh the game awards we talked about the awards we didn't talk about the announcements
[3648.90 --> 3655.06]  oh okay there's a few telltale is back they're making a video game adaptation of the amazon
[3655.06 --> 3661.06]  original tv series the expanse never watched it and probably won't play it nice i i did like wolf
[3661.06 --> 3667.06]  among us even though it got kind of samey and clearly they were not focused on it towards the
[3667.06 --> 3673.54]  towards the end yeah yeah the middle uh yeah i've always had problems with this name but senua
[3673.54 --> 3678.98]  senua's saga hellblade 2 a lot of people are really hyped about that and alan wake too both got
[3678.98 --> 3682.66]  announced people are really hyped about those sure the matrix awakened we actually mentioned that earlier
[3682.66 --> 3688.42]  so i'm gonna skip past it uh in an effort to get a bigger slice of the battle royal pie that helped
[3688.42 --> 3693.70]  bake pub g is going free to play actually kind of interesting interesting um there's gonna be some
[3693.70 --> 3701.30]  noobs to headshot yeah are you gonna play uh if i mean i have never thought that game was cool solo
[3701.30 --> 3706.66]  so if other people want to play i'm down right that's pretty much it um wonder woman game coming out
[3706.66 --> 3712.42]  being made by monolith which as other people have pointed out i think is a very good pairing yeah i think that
[3712.42 --> 3716.34]  makes a lot of sense i think they'll do a really good job with it yeah so that's cool pretty excited
[3716.34 --> 3730.58]  about that among us vr could be cool paramount plus is making a halo tv series that apparently looks like
[3730.58 --> 3737.62]  very high budget so that could be cool or terrible we'll see probably cool i would wager cool and then
[3737.62 --> 3747.86]  there's star wars eclipse which looks really cinematic the the trailer that they put out looks really cool
[3751.38 --> 3756.58]  i mean you saw my tweet earlier this week i'm sure did i i don't know oh it was very funny i said i want
[3756.58 --> 3763.62]  to fire the star wars sequels out of a cannon no oh i did yes get it good get it so many people didn't get
[3763.62 --> 3771.38]  it's like i had people correcting my spelling oh and i was like i spelled it with two n's but not
[3771.38 --> 3779.38]  together c-a-n-o-n yeah i was about to say one n but there's there's two yeah um oh man so part of
[3779.38 --> 3785.86]  the problem behind this uh is not just that star wars has been a very up and down thing for a long time
[3785.86 --> 3793.06]  uh mostly down it's also that it's made by the french studio that's behind heavy rain and detroit become human
[3793.06 --> 3799.06]  uh there it's listed in the dock as a minor controversy i don't know how minor it is i think
[3799.06 --> 3805.70]  it's more on the major side of things um but they were on the the the cancel train a couple years ago
[3806.26 --> 3811.06]  right and as far as i know they're it's kind of still the same crew and now they're making a star
[3811.06 --> 3815.70]  wars game which is actually kind of interesting because usually disney is very you know
[3817.78 --> 3821.86]  they kind of try to keep their hands clean in regards to controversy stuff when they work with
[3821.86 --> 3825.94]  other companies they've had a lot of controversy yeah i was gonna say there's a lot of evil there
[3825.94 --> 3830.66]  boy are they ever bad at it then yeah okay but usually when they try to work with other companies
[3830.66 --> 3839.54]  they're like no you have to be squeaky clean right so oh uh one moment please you gotta go uh sorry
[3839.54 --> 3844.98]  what's that oh um uh give me give me 15.
[3844.98 --> 3856.26]  okay bye my wife is leaving without me i can do it oh no it's okay i'll just do it okay whatever you
[3856.26 --> 3862.50]  want it's fine it's completely the opposite direction doesn't make sense all right let's do some anyways
[3862.50 --> 3866.98]  they they said some i don't know all the details behind it because i heard about this literally today
[3866.98 --> 3871.06]  but apparently in the past they said some like homophobic stuff and stuff if you're interested you can look
[3871.06 --> 3876.10]  into it their name is quantic dream that's the developers behind star wars eclipse got it all
[3876.10 --> 3882.42]  right super chance yeah i mean think you mean merch messages merch messages all right super messages
[3882.42 --> 3887.14]  justice says howdy from ladner what would be the best way to contact you in regards to maybe touring
[3887.14 --> 3894.02]  the neat building i work in uh you're gonna want to try the um you're gonna want to try the the just
[3894.02 --> 3900.90]  the publicly listed email it does get monitored not by me but it does peter h asks wife swap style
[3900.90 --> 3908.42]  ltt host swap series win also more gift cards for the ltd backpack and screwdriver when they launch
[3908.42 --> 3915.86]  peter's buying cards i have no idea we were we were talking about wife swap on the pre-show uh where
[3915.86 --> 3921.86]  i was joking that such a thing haha probably exists and it turns out not only does it exist it ran for
[3921.86 --> 3928.42]  like seven seasons and there were like spin-offs and there were yeah there's similar clone shows and
[3928.42 --> 3933.62]  in different regions and stuff like that um max asks when is luke gonna host tech linked yeah you
[3933.62 --> 3940.18]  should totally host tech link you should ask riley for a chance to host tech link sure out frost ltd's
[3940.18 --> 3945.46]  expanding a lot would you consider reviewing mice like build quality or more home server stuff like
[3945.46 --> 3951.14]  hbas and nix like stability of aftermarket ones also would love to see linux compatibility on more
[3951.14 --> 3956.10]  reviews i think linux compatibility in particular is something that we would like to expand our testing to
[3956.10 --> 3963.70]  include the one issue with that is that it goes up and down right that's fair but if it's in a fully
[3963.70 --> 3968.82]  working state at one point it probably won't be that far from it in the future so yeah that's that's
[3968.82 --> 3975.86]  at least reasonable to you know think okay let's go ahead and get rid of this one uh nicholas says not
[3975.86 --> 3980.58]  an expert here should a reasonably nerdy person calibrate their monitors and tvs or is it only for content
[3980.58 --> 3990.02]  creation frankly um if all i'm doing is consuming then all that matters is how it looks to me personally
[3990.02 --> 3998.66]  i like to run my displays at in like a a color accurate mode but i do not actually prefer a warm
[3998.66 --> 4004.50]  color temperature which tends to be the most color accurate way of displaying it so i i tend to go for
[4004.50 --> 4011.22]  like a calibrated or a neutral type profile and then a neutral uh color temperature rather than a
[4011.22 --> 4015.86]  warmer color temperature and that's my personal preference and it is totally up to you what your
[4015.86 --> 4021.14]  personal preference is for consumption but when it comes to creation obviously it's important that it's
[4021.14 --> 4027.30]  all created to a calibrated standard so that when everybody else has their own preferences they're not
[4027.30 --> 4032.58]  stacking their preferences on top of your preferences causing all kinds of problems
[4032.58 --> 4040.58]  andrew asks t-powered gaming pc when we really do need to do that it is on the list i'd love to
[4040.58 --> 4047.30]  build something for the spiffing brit enjoy your new mousepad andrew ignition night i've accidentally
[4047.30 --> 4053.30]  played overcooked with my wife do you think if we play it takes two it can save the marriage i mean
[4053.30 --> 4066.98]  yes yes that's it's the character that's the super annoying book character yeah yeah oh man uh jake says
[4066.98 --> 4073.38]  for your tv just use the artings guide for an ltt themed blanket they are thinking about it oh yeah
[4073.38 --> 4077.78]  yep we're definitely thinking about it sebastian just finished my fall semester in electrical engineering your
[4077.78 --> 4081.38]  videos were the only reason i pursued the field three more semesters ago hey keep up the good work
[4081.38 --> 4087.54]  sebastian love it christopher thanks for the quality content just built my first pc at 20. we'll be
[4087.54 --> 4094.42]  using it for my coffee roasting business control delete coffee roasters hey very nice enjoy eli are
[4094.42 --> 4102.34]  you guys going to talk about the log 4j2 rce exploit yeah but like is that the is that the minecraft thing
[4102.34 --> 4106.58]  yeah i think yeah yeah sorry we just didn't we don't know enough about a little bit too tight to the
[4106.58 --> 4112.26]  show yeah yeah i was i was doing some stuff today definitely doing some stuff we finally got a smoke
[4112.26 --> 4119.62]  machine we ran into the weirdest edge case man we had a a mesh version and a solid front panel version
[4119.62 --> 4127.86]  of the same case and we loaded up the mesh version with like extra noctua fans and the gpu temps were
[4127.86 --> 4134.82]  actually nearly identical to the solid front panel version with just like one stock fan in it weird yeah so
[4134.82 --> 4141.86]  it turns out that there's a lot more to optimized case flow case air flow than just making sure your
[4141.86 --> 4146.34]  case is meshy making sure it has holes it's gonna be a good video so we got a smoke machine to kind of
[4146.34 --> 4150.90]  demonstrate what was happening in this case so that we can that's cool talk through that nice it's
[4150.90 --> 4158.98]  a lot of fun tamas i'd love if l2d would cover more augmented reality news and products hey for sure but
[4158.98 --> 4170.18]  unfortunately you and dozens of other people all dozens it just the content does not perform well
[4170.74 --> 4178.98]  i'll say this there's a really cool hololens segment in the videos that i was working on uh overseas oh i
[4178.98 --> 4184.98]  think i'm allowed to say it was with intel at this point oh well it's a whole thing where there was going
[4184.98 --> 4190.10]  to be another event and i wasn't really supposed to talk about that i was there until after the other
[4190.10 --> 4196.90]  event was like okay announced but then is surreal closed their borders like immediately after i left
[4196.90 --> 4205.14]  so the other event is actually cancelled happening so um yeah so i think it doesn't matter anymore anyway
[4205.14 --> 4210.82]  those videos are coming soon uh joshua asks do you have any plans for express shipping on ltd stores right
[4210.82 --> 4216.18]  now it takes almost a month for orders to ship to india you would be horrified to see how much it
[4216.18 --> 4222.98]  would cost for express shipping we are far better off focusing on getting our volumes up as high as we
[4222.98 --> 4229.14]  can with the shipping provider that we have so that our rates can be as good as they can be yes it's going
[4229.14 --> 4235.70]  to take time sometimes we're sorry but that's the way that it's going to be for now if you want to like buy
[4235.70 --> 4240.82]  a plane ticket for your shirt johanna's asked basically the same question uh robert christmas
[4240.82 --> 4245.94]  bonus time make sure the ltd backpack has a thick pad of foam on the bottom i wouldn't describe it as
[4245.94 --> 4252.74]  super thick but what it is is it's construction it's constructed in such a way that it actually
[4252.74 --> 4260.18]  kind of tapers at the bottom of the pocket so that helps to keep it from falling down so fast neat right
[4260.18 --> 4269.54]  uh let's do that simon how has ltd prepared the office for earthquakes and other potential
[4269.54 --> 4276.58]  natural disasters um so because we do live in an earthquake zone we have pretty stringent um earthquake
[4276.58 --> 4281.94]  proofness requirements in our building code other than that we haven't really done anything else other
[4281.94 --> 4286.02]  than just do what we're supposed to be doing which is like you know bolt down shelves and stuff a lot
[4286.02 --> 4293.70]  of it's just baked into the building code yep uh wise i'm planning to make an unraid vr vm
[4293.70 --> 4299.30]  slash nas setup should i go intel or amd which is going to give me the fewest issues i might go
[4299.30 --> 4306.26]  thunderbolt for io might even mind while the gpu is idle i know i need a motherboard with good iommu
[4306.26 --> 4318.42]  man that is an extremely um sketchy configuration the odds of having that working like daily driver
[4318.98 --> 4327.54]  perfect pretty slim if you can find someone else who has built basically exactly the same thing and
[4327.54 --> 4336.02]  has it working perfectly and you can just clone their config great but that ain't that ain't a good
[4336.02 --> 4343.38]  that your chances they suck they suck big time kenneth is saying that apparently uh when they remove the
[4343.38 --> 4348.18]  dislike button they're also increasing ads on the site which i find pretty interesting uh i didn't
[4348.18 --> 4354.34]  know that part oh really uh and also he's saying uh if you guys are hiring accountants in a couple years
[4354.90 --> 4360.82]  when i'm done with my degree we probably will be we need accountant applicants now actually yeah now is
[4360.82 --> 4365.30]  the time we need accountant applicants i mean you know in a couple years feel free to reach out maybe we
[4365.30 --> 4372.02]  won't have found anyone yet but we'll see we need yeah apply now do it go go rafael says work for a pc
[4372.02 --> 4377.06]  retailer assembling pre-built the past week has been an actual nightmare with at least 50 asus prime
[4377.06 --> 4381.70]  motherboards just dying for no apparent reason which now have to be returned after we already built most
[4381.70 --> 4387.62]  of them oh rough week but you treated yourself to a neon hard drive t-shirt and an insulated water bottle
[4387.62 --> 4392.66]  hope you enjoy it nice phil hey guys love you both equally the purchase is a gift for a friend mystery
[4392.66 --> 4399.54]  water bottle and northern lights desk pad love it nice his name is race after race bannon wow from
[4399.54 --> 4413.38]  johnny quest his name is race wow race bannon i love it all right cool braden says oled awesome burnin not
[4413.38 --> 4421.38]  awesome micro lead perfect middle ground for a pc question mark all right here's the problem with micro lead
[4421.38 --> 4429.70]  the problem with micro lead just because an led is not organic doesn't mean that it won't eventually
[4429.70 --> 4438.66]  burn out in fact that characteristic i think i kind of i kind of bought into the the narrative of you
[4438.66 --> 4446.82]  know oh well they they they fade because they're organic well they that's a reason that they fade but leds
[4446.82 --> 4456.50]  can fade for lots of different reasons and normal leds can also fade so what i heard back when i was
[4456.50 --> 4465.06]  considering the wall from an installer is that it is extremely common for the panels to fade unevenly
[4465.06 --> 4470.02]  which is essentially burn in and extremely common for the cabinets to fail
[4470.02 --> 4479.30]  so i was looking at this very expensive like what was it like a quarter million dollar tv or whatever
[4479.30 --> 4485.06]  it's going to be huge knowing that i was going to have like what was it 16 cabinets or something like
[4485.06 --> 4491.62]  that and that the odds by the time you have 16 of them installed of one of them failing in a relatively
[4491.62 --> 4497.62]  short period of time was like very good i just kind of was sitting there going no i don't think
[4498.18 --> 4504.82]  i don't think this makes any sense um now that's not to say that micro led won't get better it very
[4504.82 --> 4511.94]  likely will but if i was going to be excited about anything it would probably be what james's video
[4511.94 --> 4518.10]  which is coming probably sometime in the next week or two is about and i don't know if i'm allowed to
[4518.10 --> 4522.02]  say what it is yet i think there might be some embargoes involved but man
[4522.02 --> 4532.26]  pretty cool pretty cool uh if you want some hints as to what the future of tvs might be you can go watch the
[4533.06 --> 4538.34]  uh the video that james also wrote future of tvs i think is is what it was called
[4539.94 --> 4550.58]  uh the future of tvs is not what you think was a video we released about a year ago that james wrote that should give you some idea of some of the really cool stuff that is coming down the pipe over the over the next few years
[4550.58 --> 4552.50]  over the next few years thank you john g
[4555.62 --> 4561.30]  chosen 477 i'm finally able to buy your merch i was expecting free shipping inside canada though
[4561.30 --> 4568.58]  yeah so same thing um we basically have one big bucket that everyone who orders pays into and then
[4568.58 --> 4574.98]  we use that to pay our shipping provider and we actually lose about 10 on it so we're not we're not
[4574.98 --> 4582.34]  like gouging we're just trying to make the merch accessible to everyone and that's not the best for
[4582.34 --> 4591.30]  the people for whom the shipping might have been cheaper but um hooray hooray canadian socialism or something
[4591.86 --> 4597.70]  yeah yeah that's what the essence store is for um
[4597.70 --> 4608.10]  yeah no it's for store it's ltt store it's not just s no the whole thing's an acronym um yeah moving
[4608.10 --> 4614.10]  on i guess the 2005 water cooling video reminded me that the first time i saw linus he was doing
[4614.10 --> 4622.18]  maintenance on a custom loop uh with what i say oh yep the silverstone tj11 nice it's been a minute
[4622.18 --> 4631.62]  good old silverstone tj11 man silverstone they have had some good shiz over the years tj11 man was
[4631.62 --> 4637.54]  that back when uh what's their face maximum pc used to do their like dream pc builds and all that good
[4637.54 --> 4645.62]  stuff those were so cool tj11 i love that silverstone archives all their cases on their site why doesn't
[4645.62 --> 4651.70]  every manufacturer do that why do they just remove all reference to their old products as though they
[4651.70 --> 4658.34]  never existed it's kind of weird like um uh there's there's uh there was a creator who was trying to
[4658.34 --> 4664.50]  create like a like a digital museum of apple's marketing over the years because they will just
[4665.14 --> 4671.70]  expunge it when they're done with it uh and he was like but this is sort of really important you know
[4671.70 --> 4678.66]  historical design and stuff yeah there's a lot that goes into marketing there's a lot that goes
[4678.66 --> 4684.26]  into it and he was like this is this is historically really important and uh so he had it all archived
[4684.26 --> 4690.10]  somewhere and they were basically like cease and desist you may not you may not display this this is
[4690.10 --> 4696.02]  our copyrighted material they're not wrong it's just lame but i mean i guess they can't they can't put
[4696.02 --> 4701.22]  it all in a table book for 250 dollars if it's freely available on the internet right i mean but that's
[4701.22 --> 4706.10]  the irony right is that they they did it anyway and people bought the book anyway so clearly it didn't
[4706.10 --> 4715.38]  matter apparently the tj11 is still on sale are you serious i was gonna kind of ask like has silverstone
[4715.38 --> 4721.30]  stone done a lot lately yeah i know they really pushed to increase skew counts i'm sure they're still
[4721.30 --> 4728.10]  doing that but like believe it or not silverstone has a case coming that we have a video coming about
[4728.10 --> 4732.90]  that is flipping amazing cool you know what why don't you do a couple more merch messages i'll go
[4732.90 --> 4737.46]  grab it i think it's right over there sweet thoughts on the flow x13 well that's a question for me
[4738.58 --> 4745.54]  um i know the flow x13 i'm surprised you didn't love it the one issue i have with it is it kind of
[4745.54 --> 4752.98]  feels like the display is either i don't know it's like low contrast or it has readability issues from
[4752.98 --> 4759.94]  from a distance um that's the only issue i had with it the battery life is just awesome for something
[4759.94 --> 4767.06]  with a dedicated gpu in it the performance is great um i used it on my on my trip to tel aviv
[4767.06 --> 4773.30]  and i thought it was awesome gaming with it on the go yeah i know i still love it i've got i've got two
[4774.10 --> 4778.10]  oh no the silverstone machine has been moved they cleaned the set okay i'm gonna have to look for
[4778.10 --> 4784.74]  it elsewhere all right baby all right uh dennis says watching your content since 2015 and still
[4784.74 --> 4790.18]  loving it convinced my friend to buy some sweet merch with me so take some of our first income
[4790.18 --> 4799.06]  nice heck yeah i appreciate well not me but we appreciate your first income steam link finally died
[4799.06 --> 4805.46]  that actually sucks those were pretty cool is a 200 shield pro really the best alternative right now
[4805.46 --> 4811.06]  for couch pc streaming left my old water bottle on the bus so finally getting a replacement i think a
[4811.06 --> 4817.14]  lot of that depends on how far away the computer is how realistic it is to run cables through walls
[4817.14 --> 4824.34]  things like that um i don't think i'm up on streaming to the tv technology right now i know
[4824.34 --> 4830.26]  shields have done it very well in the past um but if you could do it with a wire it's pretty good
[4830.26 --> 4838.98]  how much are 20 ounce in real units google's really really good at that i'm sorry i'm not
[4838.98 --> 4844.50]  trying to be sassy i just i have no idea and google for sure knows and they google actually has i don't
[4844.50 --> 4849.22]  know if you guys know this it has built-in calculator things for for equations like that so it will do it
[4849.22 --> 4856.58]  for sure and well good to see desk pad measurements are in metric it has both actually um could we well okay
[4856.58 --> 4863.22]  uh i think the desk pad measurements might be in metric i think you're right the desk pad configurator
[4863.22 --> 4869.22]  which is not out yet has both um could we get another terran macro guide but this time for linus
[4870.66 --> 4877.70]  no i don't i don't i'll be honest with you i don't really use macros um i don't video edit so that's
[4877.70 --> 4883.86]  that's the the reason why i tilted my head i was like wow yeah i just would you even use it for i have a
[4883.86 --> 4892.42]  confession back in my younger days i had macros for some of my most commonly used passwords
[4896.90 --> 4904.34]  like i'm talking back like og g15 days oh um because i mean password managers like we have them
[4904.34 --> 4910.02]  now weren't a thing did you have did you have one set up for your windows password uh no okay i think the
[4910.02 --> 4915.46]  logitech driver didn't load like pre-login or whatever back then not that you couldn't just
[4915.46 --> 4921.30]  extremely easily bypass windows passwords back yeah so whatever whatever um alex says my steam link
[4921.30 --> 4926.34]  finally died is a 200 shield pro really the best alternative right now for couch pc streaming yeah
[4926.34 --> 4932.74]  kind of and it does a lot of other stuff well as well um i i said it's really good try to run a cable
[4932.74 --> 4937.38]  if you can oh oh have you gone through these but not archived them uh all of them except for that one
[4937.38 --> 4944.18]  oh no and this one i pressed that what lt t-shirt does luke have on i want it that's elemental baby
[4944.18 --> 4949.86]  that was our biggest product flop ever yeah but then we turned it into a success by selling it for
[4949.86 --> 4957.94]  cheap and get this we're bringing it back for a third time we're ready to flop even harder than before
[4960.02 --> 4964.66]  why because are you guys having a hard time getting shirts in general why wouldn't you use it for
[4964.66 --> 4969.78]  different we can get black ones oh okay yeah so we we can get enough black ones that we can do
[4969.78 --> 4976.90]  another elemental so uh basically the way elemental seems to kind of work now is we take the two top
[4976.90 --> 4983.86]  selling designs from the last failure or like the least worst ones we continue those we do two more
[4984.74 --> 4990.82]  and then rinse and repeat so that's what we're doing again we're taking the two best of the worst from
[4990.82 --> 4997.22]  last time and then lloyd has done up two more two more new colors so there are now a total of eight
[4997.22 --> 5003.70]  elemental designs over three generations once the new ones launch and they too can be yours for
[5004.98 --> 5010.82]  i don't know you could buy them for full price but or just wait if you hold out we just might discount
[5010.82 --> 5017.38]  them sorry i had something i had something stuck behind there like it's such a stupid product because we
[5017.38 --> 5023.62]  don't make any money on it but it seems to actually generate a shocking amount of hype and there are
[5023.62 --> 5029.38]  people who actually do like it so that's cool i think they're fine i don't think they're necessarily
[5029.38 --> 5033.38]  as cool as some of the other options which is why i think they might not sell that well i don't think
[5033.38 --> 5040.34]  it's a bad shirt um i just think there's a lot of other like potentially cooler ones and you see we are
[5040.34 --> 5045.86]  going to be getting more wan hoodies as soon as we can as soon as we can i don't want to promise
[5045.86 --> 5051.06]  anything because worldwide logistics is so screwed up right now that if i promise something i'm
[5051.06 --> 5058.82]  basically setting myself up to be a big liar thanks tomic this purchase is sponsored by my birthday oh
[5058.82 --> 5064.74]  okay hey linus and luke picking up a new lanyard for my badge as i just started a new it job a month ago

[5075.70 --> 5080.98]  back are there plans for a wi-fi mesh comparison video i would love to do it but we don't really
[5080.98 --> 5087.78]  have a suitable test platform for it right now what we need is a relatively rf clean environment
[5088.82 --> 5093.94]  so that we can isolate our variables and it's just not something that we have available to us at the
[5093.94 --> 5099.30]  moment kind of need both because you want to test it out in a messy environment too anyways yeah i'm sure
[5100.42 --> 5104.10]  greetings from serbia been with you since the beloved kitchen and that one disappeared
[5104.10 --> 5109.14]  um no it's just down one christopher says love the new party show oh okay yeah no never mind we'll

[5124.66 --> 5131.46]  install step three enjoy inaccessible undeletable folders i believe you man i had to get the new minecraft
[5131.46 --> 5138.90]  launcher for my kids and it was a mess like the one in the xbox store or whatever just total mess the
[5138.90 --> 5145.46]  old java edition launcher was just perfect for both minecraft and dungeons was fine i i haven't i haven't
[5145.46 --> 5152.82]  tried it but i have heard if you get halo through steam you you get the cross-platform play thing so you
[5152.82 --> 5159.86]  you can play it on xbox but your save doesn't transfer it only transfers if you bought it through the windows
[5159.86 --> 5169.22]  store which is just like why okay it's not even like that big of a deal because i don't know that
[5169.22 --> 5176.34]  many people that are going to play a single player game on both but like some people will alex f slowly
[5176.34 --> 5182.34]  replacing all my underwear with ltt heck yeah nice thanks thumbs up does this banner support emoji well
[5182.34 --> 5188.26]  we didn't push yours to the banner so i guess we don't know still i think so because the yeah anyways
[5188.26 --> 5193.70]  okay dagan says been watching since 2017 love the content merch keep it up hey thanks dagan verla
[5194.26 --> 5199.38]  hey you're welcome glad your boyfriend will enjoy it hey we got a couple of these ones and we've got
[5199.38 --> 5205.38]  two more after anthony's latest macbook pro m1 max review for creative purposes would you still prefer
[5205.38 --> 5209.70]  macbook seeing that it falls short of the 3060 mobile and all tests except video editing really the
[5209.70 --> 5214.66]  answer is what software are you running because if the software that you're running needs a mac
[5214.66 --> 5225.14]  mac then buy a mac and if it doesn't then don't buy a mac that was like uh when my when my mom was
[5225.14 --> 5231.86]  working on movies and tv shows and stuff yep a lot of sets kind of required ios devices because they
[5231.86 --> 5239.30]  used things like airdrop or or whatever else and there was like a mild debate starting about like whether
[5239.30 --> 5245.38]  or not she should get an ios device she's never used one before and the conclusion which we probably
[5245.38 --> 5251.22]  should have gotten to a little bit faster but we did get to was like it doesn't matter she has to
[5251.22 --> 5256.66]  get one so like yeah let's just get it and then try to learn it and luckily she adapted to it really
[5256.66 --> 5261.62]  fast and everything was fine but alexis i want to buy your water bottle but it's metal and that usually
[5261.62 --> 5267.14]  makes my water taste metallic does that happen with your bottles so they end up with a bit of like
[5267.14 --> 5273.22]  manufacturing stank taste for i'd say probably somewhere between the first five and 15 washes
[5273.22 --> 5278.74]  like i'm pretty sensitive to it so i'll take a new bottle and i'll just sit and i will wash it like
[5278.74 --> 5284.10]  five or ten times but after that no i do not detect any metallic taste and if you go on the site
[5284.74 --> 5293.30]  we do not censor our reviews i hate it when companies do this every review aside from ones that are spam
[5293.30 --> 5300.10]  every review stays on the site so if you go through the 471 reviews i actually remember reading one
[5300.10 --> 5305.94]  that mentioned metallic tastes like yesterday or today or something like that you can see we actually
[5305.94 --> 5312.50]  get so many reviews on the site that all of these are from today these five if we go on to the next page
[5312.50 --> 5319.86]  all of these are from today yeah we remove ones that are clearly spam or are clearly inappropriate
[5319.86 --> 5330.10]  um there's ones that have had like lots of wording in it that is like not appropriate for a tech review
[5330.58 --> 5337.86]  um so that's a thing had nothing to do with like the actual product etc those are the only things that
[5337.86 --> 5345.54]  would be removed oh you know what i think uh i think the review i saw was on the mystery bottle
[5345.54 --> 5352.02]  mystery bottle this one doesn't have as many reviews either because well it's got a lot
[5352.02 --> 5357.94]  jake is holding the case hostage does he have it he has it oh oh yeah i couldn't find it where is it
[5357.94 --> 5362.98]  i think he hid it from you oh speaking of which jake is coming over for uh for gaming tonight do you
[5362.98 --> 5368.98]  want to come too yeah okay cool so why don't we just all head to my house after yeah nice okay here it is
[5368.98 --> 5375.22]  from evan jensen perfect doesn't have metallic aftertaste boom you heard it from evan first my
[5375.22 --> 5380.02]  biggest gripe with reusable water bottles is that most give the water metallic taste these do not have
[5380.02 --> 5387.22]  that problem hey there you go confirmed and we've apparently got some gaming to do now so we will see
[5387.22 --> 5393.22]  you all later thanks hi b with this shirt i will always wear it with linus and luke in my heat sinking

[5433.06 --> 5439.38]  rumors of an lg 97 inch 4k oled in 2022 cause you to rethink your home theater choices
[5440.98 --> 5446.90]  97 inch oled it's pretty big that's pretty big that's pretty big i think i want to go projector
[5446.90 --> 5451.54]  though i think we're we've got light control in the room now i think we're going 130 inch projector
