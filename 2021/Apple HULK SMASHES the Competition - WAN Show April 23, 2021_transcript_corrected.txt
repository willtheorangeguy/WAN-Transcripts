[0.00 → 12.44] what is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan show we've got a fantastic show for you guys
[12.44 → 19.84] today with obviously the big headline topic being Apple's event this week they went and they I mean
[19.84 → 26.36] it's like their entire corporate strategy is put a m1 in it, they went they put m1 chips in topic
[26.36 → 33.42] whoa what is that stop please ah terrible sorry about that they put a m1 in pretty much everything
[33.42 → 40.74] and we're gonna talk through what that means not just for their products but also for you know
[40.74 → 46.48] potentially the environment we did a little video this week on product repairability and right to
[46.48 → 52.64] repair and putting m1s and things definitely has an impact on that we're also going to talk about
[52.64 → 58.14] the no we're not going to talk about that ah yes the project cloud beta that rolled out on iOS
[58.14 → 64.00] and pc that makes project cloud an even more compelling option than it was already for those
[64.00 → 70.88] of you out there who are still struggling to get a graphics card and what else we got Luke
[70.88 → 78.22] we have some uh, uh some non-news topics as well talking about how Linus brought go-karts home for
[78.22 → 82.12] his kids which sounds amazing I'm going to tell you all about them, they're so cool you have to come over
[82.12 → 88.06] and try them sometime anyway carry on and uh that Linus might be building a pc with a basketball
[88.06 → 96.52] star yes oh I am so excited to talk about that okay yeah we're going to have a great show for you guys
[96.52 → 98.26] today and let's go ahead roll that intro
[98.26 → 126.46] and the show is brought to you today by private internet access ridge wallet and
[126.46 → 134.52] see sonic why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day and that is of course apple's fall
[134.52 → 141.16] 420 event now I think that um what do you want to start with Luke do you want to start with their
[141.16 → 148.80] tile competitor the air tags tracker or the apple refresh i I think the tile competitor thing is
[148.80 → 155.96] almost it's its own topic entirely due to the uh the friction that they're having with uh what is the
[155.96 → 161.64] even other brand I never had tile yes the friction they're having with tile so maybe let's leave that
[161.64 → 171.08] off and do the slew of m1 products all right so man this iPad Pro now Luke have you ever owned a
[171.08 → 177.80] tablet in your life no have you ever had any desire to own a tablet in your life nope okay stop looking
[177.80 → 185.68] at the specs stop looking at the specs close your eyes and imagine this okay it's a 12.9 inch display
[185.68 → 192.74] okay, so this is a freaking this is a big tablet okay it's big enough for like real man hands
[192.74 → 198.74] all right okay it's got a type c port on the bottom, but we already had that okay we already had
[198.74 → 205.92] that on the iPad Pro but get this the type c port is freaking thunderbolt okay that's pretty sick okay
[205.92 → 213.20] so we've got a thunderbolt iPad okay now let me tell you about the CPU or rather the SOC apple they
[213.20 → 219.38] went, and they put the same m1 processor from their recent MacBook Pro and MacBook Air they went they
[219.38 → 226.38] threw it in an iPad and for all the jokes that we made about the new m1 macBooks being basically iPads
[226.38 → 232.54] with keyboards and without touch screens the m1 processor that is a very good thing going in this
[232.54 → 237.02] direction it's a very good thing going in both directions it was never meant to mean that iPad
[237.02 → 244.38] pros were not fast it was meant to mean that okay these devices are obviously converging here and it that
[244.38 → 251.52] has come to fruition we have a m1 equipped iPad Pro now here's the kicker okay imagine this in a mobile
[251.52 → 262.52] device a thousand nit backlit screen 1600 nits peak brightness with 2500 local dimming zones okay you can
[262.52 → 266.24] open your eyes now you can open your eyes okay I don't actually fully understand why they were closed
[266.24 → 268.96] they were closed so you could imagine better okay
[268.96 → 277.50] I appreciated the experience regardless so this iPad which starts at
[277.50 → 281.90] sounds awesome start at like 900 or something like that can't remember the pricing doesn't matter
[281.90 → 289.42] the point is this iPad will be probably the fastest computing device in your household when it comes to
[289.42 → 295.12] single threaded or even lightly threaded tasks it will be it will have the fastest connectivity in your
[295.12 → 301.52] household with a 40 gigabit per second connection that you could use for I mean it runs iPadOS so i
[301.52 → 307.62] wouldn't necessarily expect that you're going to be hooking up like your audio interface to it anytime
[307.62 → 312.82] soon but who knows what the future is going to hold at least the capabilities there now, but you could
[312.82 → 320.58] definitely hook up something like a Pro Display XDR 6k external display with you know an USB hub for all
[320.58 → 327.54] your peripherals use the thing as a freaking you know iPadOS freaking desktop and get this
[327.54 → 334.18] it will probably be the best HDR content viewing experience in your household
[334.18 → 341.84] in the range of a thousand dollars so yes an iPad is an expensive device for a tablet which to me the
[341.84 → 349.66] utility is would you buy very limited I mean we're talking like what would you use a tablet for like
[349.66 → 357.24] watching porn in bed like it's the best device for that well it is come on I'm not going to argue maybe
[357.24 → 362.40] not because VR headsets exist but oh come on it's up there you're not going to have a VR headset in your
[362.40 → 367.06] oh I guess they've got the standalone ones okay that's fair I guarantee you people do I guarantee
[367.06 → 372.36] okay you know what I take your guarantee I will see your guarantee and raise you two guarantees
[372.36 → 375.96] I'm with you, I'm with you on that I just mean
[375.96 → 385.40] okay yeah VR headset okay fine it's up there though I will give it that okay, okay it's the best device for
[385.40 → 392.64] um, um watching Netflix on the couch while your so is watching something else on the TV
[392.64 → 400.38] and if you have the kind of disposable income that you can buy a device that is dedicated to that
[400.38 → 409.60] then the iPad has got you covered but with these changes now it's so much more because okay you can't
[409.60 → 414.94] use the last gen magic keyboard but if you add a magic keyboard now all of a sudden it's a fold-out
[414.94 → 420.36] little laptop thing that also you can disconnect it's basically a convertible but with extra steps
[420.36 → 427.00] and that display a thousand nits full screen brightness Luke this is real HDR
[427.00 → 435.44] yeah what why can't you use the previous keyboard I don't know because what's the possible limitation
[435.44 → 442.36] there like it's so ridiculous I mean it's like a little thicker so like I don't know maybe there's
[442.36 → 446.66] a physical compatibility that could possibly have been overcome by the billions and billions of
[446.66 → 454.00] dollars that apple spends on and of course yes that's possible oh that that that part just annoys me
[454.00 → 459.52] but maybe it is like yeah maybe there are some shape issues or something I don't know but yeah I mean
[459.52 → 464.20] we haven't been hands-on with it yet but okay so, so now that we've talked through that this
[464.20 → 473.52] thing is barely even an iPad anymore could you possibly be compelled to use it to use it yes sure
[473.52 → 482.98] okay to pay almost anything for it no almost anything okay a hundred bucks
[482.98 → 492.32] probably not are you serious well if I could flip it a hundred guarantee that's not what I'm asking
[492.32 → 497.32] I'm going to use it so like it's its not the fact that it's a perfect deal it doesn't matter
[497.32 → 502.52] because I don't think I would ever use it what about for gaming you don't have a single other iOS device
[502.52 → 508.60] in hold on you bear with me now sir okay, okay you don't have that game that you want to play you
[508.60 → 516.74] don't have a single other iOS device in your house so why not for gaming like you could play compelling
[516.74 → 523.72] exclusives like fantasia and I don't know if they have any other ones I feel like pulling out a viva
[523.72 → 528.20] the dirt league just like keyboard slamming someone over the head and be like no one games on max
[528.20 → 534.02] like i I don't know I have no idea like what like no I'm I'm good i have plenty of
[534.02 → 541.34] devices in this house that I can play games on um and what a terrible buying a tablet
[541.34 → 546.78] for gaming no, but it has thunderbolt a thousand dollars it has thunderbolt so you can connect it to anything
[546.78 → 555.00] but you're still running iPadOS yeah but like yeah but what that's horrible okay hold on when's the
[555.00 → 565.04] last time you used iPadOS it's been a long time okay, okay didn't you have an iPad like quite a while
[565.04 → 571.02] ago at your house or something I still have an iPad too at my house yeah that was probably it that iPad
[571.02 → 577.50] was probably the last so iPadOS has changed a lot it does support keyboard and mouse properly
[577.50 → 583.14] what do you play on it no, no no, no no I don't mean from like a gaming standpoint even I just mean
[583.14 → 588.02] you can just like to use a keyboard and mouse on it so if you were just word processing doing whatever
[588.02 → 595.36] oh oh oh there you could use it for um uh I believe the update came ah shoot who are those guys
[595.36 → 601.14] that we worked with that have an um uh it's not parsec, but it's another kind of similar thing but I'm
[601.14 → 605.40] pretty sure parsec probably has it working so you could stream games to your iPad if you're just
[605.40 → 611.54] like on the couch or whatever um so you could use it to a laptop yeah you could do that to a laptop
[611.54 → 618.02] yes which I have which you have already, but your laptop doesn't have a HDR display on it with 1600
[618.02 → 623.34] nit peak brightness okay so you could HDR game not that any of those game streaming services support
[623.34 → 630.54] HDR yet anyway but at some point they might um escapement dog says and i but I mean as Marquez
[630.54 → 636.52] tweeted on Twitter you don't buy things with pro for software promises down the line so I would
[636.52 → 642.18] not get it for that reason uh escapement dog says an iPad is great for eating digital magazines
[642.18 → 650.76] no don't care I'm sorry escapement dog uh that was not going to work you're a float plane subscriber
[650.76 → 657.94] and so I'm not going to be too rude to you because thank you very much but are you for real what
[657.94 → 667.82] magazines what do people read magazines what generation are you in but seriously thank you very
[667.82 → 674.40] much for yes appreciate it thanks for supporting um okay, okay okay sky scan r says I have an iPad Mini
[674.40 → 678.92] for my drone that is a great application for the mini we're not talking about the mini but hey cool
[678.92 → 682.82] that's great sure, and you don't need any of the features or to spend anywhere near as much
[682.82 → 690.42] again though if it's at that 100 discounted price and I cared sure okay but i still don't
[690.42 → 695.40] JAL says rainway was the one I'm talking about where you could keyboard mouse game on an iPad
[695.40 → 703.54] streaming from your gaming pc uh apocalyptic on three says Linus puts way more value
[703.54 → 709.10] in HDR than I think the average person does the average person doesn't put a lot of value in HDR
[709.10 → 715.98] because the average person hasn't experienced HDR properly HDR is a big difference maker I mean Luke
[715.98 → 722.68] now that you have a HDR TV would you go back well I mean I would, but it's a fantastic feature I like it
[722.68 → 732.06] a lot um it's very noticeable when you're playing HDR content it is very nice, and you can really tell
[732.06 → 739.28] when you're watching content on the TV that does have HDR yeah um do you remember when you got float
[739.28 → 745.10] plane to uh make it so that HDR content could be played through the website do you remember that
[745.10 → 750.90] I do you remember when it was super urgent because you guys were going to totally pivot to
[750.90 → 757.16] everything being filmed and uploaded in HDR do you remember that well i remember that you
[757.16 → 762.12] guys only uploaded one video in that format, and it took like a lot of work I remember a thing like
[762.12 → 766.04] this happening I remember a thing like this happening I can't say that I remember when it
[766.04 → 772.18] happened because my memory doesn't go back that far it was quite a while ago do you know we're still
[772.18 → 780.52] supporting that uh yes so okay in fairness we are working on it um ed says okay that was actually a
[780.52 → 784.76] somewhat genuine question because yes I needed to know because we were wondering if because we're doing
[784.76 → 791.18] some upgrades we need to know bring it yeah so uh yes we're bringing it along for the ride ed is still
[791.18 → 796.84] working on the workflow for that so ultimately it's funny but what it comes down to is that float plane
[796.84 → 804.42] is not getting HDR because adobe and YouTube still haven't gotten together and figured out how to have
[804.42 → 810.74] premiere output all the metadata in a format that YouTube can natively understand and accept got it
[810.74 → 818.46] okay so that is why sounds good i uh yeah that that my friends is how you pivot Sancho into a
[818.46 → 824.64] flow plane work meeting um okay great sorry do you have any more uh use cases land shark says I read the
[824.64 → 831.32] economist also reading books is nice on a tablet i you know I can't get into it, I can't get into it for
[831.32 → 836.80] me the galaxy fold was kind of a game changer for me because it was something that I had on me all
[836.80 → 841.66] the time like I actually read more when I was daily driving a fold speaking of which and also
[841.66 → 848.86] float plane related um is Jayden ever going to send back my fold z2 no yes fold 2 or whatever they
[848.86 → 852.52] call the stupid thing I thought he sent that out already okay cool yeah if I can get that back that
[852.52 → 857.98] would be great thanks um so that was a game changer for me but I would never go get a tablet for that
[857.98 → 861.84] if I'm going to go get a device like I have to actually get up off my honey I don't have it on me
[861.84 → 867.44] already i have to go get one I'm going to go get a Kindle or something with an e-ink display I was
[867.44 → 872.52] going to say right when you said I would way rather have an e-ink display by the way I saw a really
[872.52 → 877.46] cool project not that long ago I should have thrown this in the dock actually but yeah um I think it was
[877.46 → 884.02] a few weeks back I saw a really cool project where someone made uh a very large like almost I think it
[884.02 → 890.92] was like a monitor sized e-ink just he didn't make this um he worked he developed on top of it but
[890.92 → 896.22] he bought this very large like monitor size e-ink display vertical mounted on the wall and then had
[896.22 → 900.86] it grabs random newspapers from his area and display them, and it looked like super cool and I thought
[900.86 → 904.72] there'd be some other cool things just because you don't read newspapers that you could do with it
[904.72 → 911.40] um e-ink displays are freaking awesome yeah they're super cool, and it's kind of unfortunate that tech
[911.40 → 918.20] hasn't really been going further than e-readers this is great this is from rod uh from BS mods uh give
[918.20 → 924.58] Luke a hundred bucks what would he be more likely to buy an iPad Pro or a tube TV for retro games
[924.58 → 932.80] oh yeah tube TV for retro games it depends if it's good though you get it you get a killer deal you find
[932.80 → 937.76] a good one yeah yeah neither of those is happening at a hundred dollars if we're being realistic like
[937.76 → 943.28] crappy tube TVs you can get them for free if you're willing to haul them away, but the good ones are
[943.28 → 948.66] actually starting to become like honestly if I had acquired them when they were worth nothing
[948.66 → 954.26] five eight ten years ago and I just stored them in a warehouse till now that's probably one
[954.26 → 959.82] of the best investments that I could have made like yeah those things are going for crazy amounts of
[959.82 → 964.66] money now yeah you know the operative thing that rod said though was give Luke a hundred dollars and he
[964.66 → 968.38] has to buy one of these two things because I wouldn't buy either of them with my own hundred dollars
[968.38 → 975.30] yeah I get it um courageous potato says it is an unmatched pencil experience besides a Wacom tablet
[975.30 → 981.22] yep that's fair if you are actually into sketching and whatnot there is a lot you can do as an artist
[981.22 → 987.78] with an iPad so you want to have like a mobile photography workstation absolutely crazy amazing
[987.78 → 994.52] device I'm super into it, I think it's a compelling value now let's talk about the m1 equipped IMAX that
[994.52 → 1000.50] come in six different colours that happen to be the six colours of the original Apple logo apparently
[1000.50 → 1008.26] so um yeah smaller bezels have you seen these have you seen this I have yes okay smaller
[1008.26 → 1015.04] bezels let's talk about the external power brick this is the first to my knowledge this is the first
[1015.04 → 1023.00] apple desktop machine to ever have an external power brick even the trash can the tiny little trash can
[1023.00 → 1031.08] had an internal power supply did it not uh am I mistaken thought it did no I thought it did um I can
[1031.08 → 1039.00] look it up though but I thought it did I'm pretty still apparently the g4 cube the g4 cube oh
[1039.00 → 1048.72] okay all right so that's fair yep there are some old ones but like why so there's a couple it feels
[1048.72 → 1055.00] honestly uh despite your evidence that you've you've pointed out um that very, very few have ever
[1055.00 → 1060.18] had an external power brick for some reason to me, it feels very apple to do that if they could make
[1060.18 → 1067.66] the design of the device itself like sleeker I could totally if for some reason it clicks in my brain that
[1067.66 → 1074.90] they would absolutely have an external power brick, so then my next question is why does it need a magnetic
[1074.90 → 1081.92] cable on a desktop we're not talking something that you've got at your know in the Starbucks or
[1081.92 → 1087.04] whatever and someone might trip over it because to me that was one of the big selling points of MagSafe
[1087.04 → 1092.90] it wasn't that I'm too much of a smooth brain chimp to plug in a barrel connector it was just that
[1092.90 → 1098.98] if someone else is too much of a smooth brain chimp to foot flick when they accidentally hit my cable
[1098.98 → 1103.98] and you know the foot flick luke's the one who coined the name for it but where your foot like
[1103.98 → 1108.82] hits the cable, and you flick up so that you don't actually you know drag whatever it is off
[1108.82 → 1113.40] the table so if someone is dumb enough that they drag my laptop off the table to me that was like
[1113.40 → 1121.24] a killer feature that could save you two grand like the first time you go and use it on a desktop
[1121.24 → 1128.32] op1 says literally all macBooks have external power bricks yes, but we said desktop max
[1128.32 → 1137.58] like help, help me out here yeah i I mean okay so one counter that I'll bring up with is why not
[1137.58 → 1145.66] um I mean they're charging a lot for it so you might as well get some like cool NATO features
[1145.66 → 1150.82] and like maybe you're you're cleaning under your desk, and you like oink the cable it's probably
[1150.82 → 1158.18] very light and thus very easily accidentally manipulated yeah um so I'd rat like if I'm sure it
[1158.18 → 1163.42] weighs more than just my non-computer monitor that's in front, or it probably weighs sorry I'm
[1163.42 → 1168.04] sure it weighs less than my non-computer monitor that's in front of me yeah um really so if you
[1168.04 → 1172.44] if you yank on the cable I wouldn't want that really expensive device just whack into the wall
[1172.44 → 1176.40] I guess there's also a thinness factor where are you going to put it like I've seen external displays
[1176.40 → 1181.20] that are that thin, but you plug in from the side and there's no way that was going to fly with apple
[1181.20 → 1186.64] still I mean there 's's a hundred other ways that you could connect something it doesn't have
[1186.64 → 1192.06] to be magnetic you could have it go on and like kind of screw on to a thing or like you could yeah
[1192.06 → 1197.18] like I mean there's a thousand different ways to connect a thing to a thing wasn't it Xbox or
[1197.18 → 1201.36] Microsoft that started the like breakaway controller design I always thought that was really
[1201.36 → 1207.68] smart uh I think oh yeah with the Xbox I mean I'm sure that they didn't invent it but yeah that's
[1207.68 → 1213.44] probably one of the more famous mainstream implementations of a breakaway cable yeah so
[1213.44 → 1218.22] they could have done something like that um yeah I mean I'm not against it because why not i i i when
[1218.22 → 1222.42] I heard that it had that feature I was like oh okay like it's its cool it's not it's not gonna
[1222.42 → 1228.54] sell the device for me but now let's talk about the bigger problem okay a lot of people are upset
[1228.54 → 1233.44] about the chin bar I get it people are upset about the chin bar because what modern monitor has a
[1233.44 → 1239.86] chin bar why and okay yeah that's a good point it's a thing to be upset about because it's so
[1239.86 → 1244.54] unnecessary in the interest of making it as thin as possible from the side where you will quite
[1244.54 → 1249.96] literally never see it apple went and put a big ugly chin in front of you where you will see it all day
[1249.96 → 1257.58] every day and all for what to save you like this much space on your desk like that's that's a funny
[1257.58 → 1263.46] thing when we went from CRTs to flat screen displays excuse me flat panel displays because
[1263.46 → 1268.92] a flat screen display is a CRT with a flat piece of glass on the front that is an important distinction
[1268.92 → 1275.16] so when we went from CRTs to flat panel displays all of a sudden there was a significant like desk
[1275.16 → 1281.14] savings you know you could your setup was so much cleaner all of a sudden and motion on your screen
[1281.14 → 1287.40] was smeary and horrible, but boy did you ever get a cleaner desk setup here i I don't see the difference
[1287.40 → 1294.86] between this and this and I feel like apple is kind of coming at this trend really late like for
[1294.86 → 1300.16] years and years TV manufacturers kept chasing thinner and thinner oh we made it a millimetre
[1300.16 → 1306.00] thinner we made it a millimetre thinner LG went as far as to make a wallpaper TV and then I don't know
[1306.00 → 1312.76] if you guys noticed, but that whole thing has kind of gone away like there are thin TVs but nobody's
[1312.76 → 1317.38] talking about it any more it's not like when you go to CES they're like it's 30 thinner
[1317.38 → 1322.94] because they figured out that beyond a certain point I'd say beyond like it doesn't really matter
[1322.94 → 1330.32] any more thick nobody cares because it does not make an appreciable difference to how you enjoy the
[1330.32 → 1336.10] product so I can see why people are upset about that element of the chin bar because they could
[1336.10 → 1340.38] have just made it thicker they could have sucked everything on the back of it honestly the one that
[1340.38 → 1348.24] I'm way more upset about is the lack of Ethernet it doesn't have Ethernet on board that's actually
[1348.24 → 1354.58] super bonkers yeah like yep how mind-blowing is that to you and like it's not like I don't talk to
[1354.58 → 1362.14] people where I go you know hey are you know your connection's kind of bad are you on Wi-Fi
[1362.14 → 1370.74] and they'll say yeah I'm on Wi-Fi and I'll say can you go get a wire because even the best Wi-Fi
[1370.74 → 1376.32] is not as good as the worst okay I shouldn't say that yeah and i yeah there is some perfect
[1376.32 → 1381.98] wireless solutions but like i I'd also say like it's its just kind of weird because so many like
[1381.98 → 1388.40] you're talking about calls right and especially in the current pandemic state so many calls are
[1388.40 → 1396.68] happening from home devices and these m1 max look like home devices um so to not have that wire
[1396.68 → 1404.38] connection in it's whether it's video calls normal calls or streaming um because as much as a lot of
[1404.38 → 1409.74] streaming started with just games there are tons of artist streamers and yeah like non-gaming
[1409.74 → 1415.44] streamers out there now uh so to have that limitation just feels super weird I there 's's a way to
[1415.44 → 1420.14] get like a dock or something that comes with it right it comes with the higher end one so the power
[1420.14 → 1426.84] brick actually has an Ethernet jack in it which is kind of an ingenious solution to not having to plug
[1426.84 → 1435.50] yet another wire into the back of the machine, but it bothers me a lot that people are going to buy the
[1435.50 → 1444.58] lower end model not have an Ethernet jack at all and then i their nephew or grandson or whatever
[1444.58 → 1450.54] are going to go over to their house they're going to complain that the internet doesn't work or their
[1450.54 → 1459.20] phone calls are bad or whatever and then I'm going to have to go and go buy like an USB Ethernet
[1459.20 → 1464.00] dongle to hang off the back because it's going to be so much cheaper than buying a replacement power
[1464.00 → 1471.58] brick oh yeah definitely it's just really it's just really frustrating because I know for a fact
[1471.58 → 1480.18] that the cost of like an Ethernet controller is literally like between a dollar and two dollars
[1480.18 → 1489.32] it's actually negligible in the context of you know a 700 800 900 thousand dollar product
[1489.32 → 1500.42] so can we just can we not you know can we not save that dollar can we just provide it with everyone
[1500.42 → 1508.12] it not everything has to be wireless and in fact the fewer items are what that are wireless in your
[1508.12 → 1514.44] house or in your office the better those wireless things will perform so if you plug in every single
[1514.44 → 1521.00] desktop your laptops and phones and tablets are all going to deliver a better user experience
[1521.00 → 1528.84] so kind of whack i I'm I'm interested I've been trying to look it up but this power connector
[1528.84 → 1535.40] that that includes Ethernet I wonder how they're doing that i found a picture that that shows
[1535.40 → 1540.22] the wall side where there's like the Ethernet jack and the power to the wall but I can't see
[1540.22 → 1544.86] anything on the other end is it it's its just a single cable that does power and Ethernet I would
[1544.86 → 1550.18] guess that it's just some kind of USB power delivery that they're using for the device itself
[1550.18 → 1554.50] so then it's no surprise that it would have data channels in it as well that would be my god that
[1554.50 → 1558.76] makes sense I'm guessing right now though I haven't seen the actual connector so we'd have to have a look
[1558.76 → 1567.66] at it yeah that's interesting okay um anyway you know what I think honestly it's white bezels and
[1567.66 → 1572.40] chin bar aside I think people are going to get used to that it's going to be like the notch where
[1572.40 → 1578.50] it starts out where people are angry, and then it becomes iconic or something and these things are
[1578.50 → 1583.50] going to sell like absolute hotcakes because what apple has managed to do with the m1, and we talked
[1583.50 → 1589.06] about this in our MacBook Air and in our uh macBook or do they call it the air I can't remember if it's
[1589.06 → 1595.16] error pro or error or non anything just macBook uh but in the MacBook Pro that also has the m1 processor
[1595.16 → 1599.70] we talked about this in our reviews what apple has managed to do with the m1 processor is nothing
[1599.70 → 1604.74] short of amazing they have delivered better performance at a lower price I mean that's
[1604.74 → 1610.44] something that apple hasn't seemed to care at all about in a very long time it's always been yeah
[1610.44 → 1614.30] better performance but hey it comes at a higher price like if you look at the introductory prices
[1614.30 → 1622.28] of basically every iPhone it always goes up right like the original iPhone yeah for sure what was the
[1622.28 → 1627.30] MSRP of that thing uh let me look it up it's like four or five hundred bucks for the cheapest one
[1627.30 → 1636.64] they have literally doubled in price since 2007 my problem with the m1 is that if apple doesn't
[1637.36 → 1642.88] kind of surprise me here or not with the m1 yeah there's nothing they can do to surprise me but my
[1642.88 → 1648.92] problem with Apple Silicon with their m series processors is that there's absolutely nothing that
[1648.92 → 1655.86] you can do to upgrade or change it after the fact and do you remember when apple was cool
[1655.86 → 1662.62] and they allowed you to use your iMac as an external display for another computer do you remember that
[1662.62 → 1667.02] that was awesome actually and me and these I think I know the direction you're going in these would
[1667.02 → 1676.00] look kind of cool as displays sure and whether they look cool or not just keeping it out of the landfill
[1676.00 → 1685.02] once the computer is too slow having it have any purpose whatsoever beyond just being your computer
[1685.02 → 1690.56] I mean honestly just this is a totally shallow thing but even just having the ability to have two
[1690.56 → 1696.26] matching monitors on your desk today if you just buy two of them and use one of them as a monitor
[1696.26 → 1702.94] whatever your reason for it is that was a really cool feature and I will be really disappointed if it
[1702.94 → 1708.98] doesn't turn out to be a hidden feature of this one because as it is if anything goes wrong with
[1708.98 → 1716.36] this thing it is basically headed to the wood chipper and yeah you can recycle certain elements
[1716.36 → 1725.08] of it, but recycling is not the best solution extending the life of it past just its initial usefulness as
[1725.08 → 1732.42] an all-in-one computer is by far a better solution than recycling it so I hope that turns out to be a
[1732.42 → 1739.00] thing but honestly I don't have a lot of hope for it um maybe someone who knows something that i
[1739.00 → 1744.92] don't can let me know in the float plane chat CJ strong says if it weren't for the silicon shortage
[1744.92 → 1749.94] do you think the iMac would have a new m2 processor no there's no way I mean with the lead time
[1749.94 → 1756.82] on a project like this yeah this product has been in development since at least like 24 months ago
[1756.82 → 1762.10] don't kid yourself so we didn't even know there was going to be a silicon shortage by the time they
[1762.10 → 1770.82] were sitting down to work on the 24 or 23 point whatever inch iMac um and honestly apple so far
[1770.82 → 1778.04] hasn't really been meaningfully impacted by the silicon shortage because apple does just an outstanding
[1778.04 → 1784.20] job of managing their supply chain I mean at the end of the day you can think apple is a
[1784.20 → 1789.92] luxury brand, or you can think they're a consumer electronics brand or a technology brand or a
[1789.92 → 1797.24] services brand you know got your Apple TV and all that kind of stuff their iCloud what apple is first and
[1797.24 → 1805.50] foremost is a supply chain company because they do it like pretty much nobody does it I mean when's the
[1805.50 → 1814.20] last time you wanted to buy an apple something, and you couldn't do it maybe for the first
[1814.20 → 1819.36] couple of weeks after the launch of a really hot product like I think the AirPods were kind of hard
[1819.36 → 1825.28] to get your hands on for the first couple of weeks, but they recover like you were kind of saying they
[1825.28 → 1830.96] recover a lot faster than a lot of other companies do too like the switch or the Wii and like Nintendo
[1830.96 → 1837.20] theoretically must have a pretty good set a little bit of experience you'd think yeah but like
[1837.20 → 1844.54] both the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo Switch were both horrible like almost impossible to buy for
[1844.54 → 1848.14] very extended periods of time and then I mean the switch had been out for a while, and then it was
[1848.14 → 1853.50] almost impossible to buy again for a very significant amount of time what was the uh yeah we fit
[1853.50 → 1863.28] was practically impossible to buy for like six or seven months in the pandemic 100 wow 100 all right
[1863.28 → 1870.42] uh we should announce uh something pretty special soon and I guess we're going to do it right now yes
[1870.42 → 1876.54] ladies and gentlemen hold on one sec hold on oh I'm getting a call from the president give me a moment
[1876.54 → 1884.64] hello president oh uh you're we can hear you know that right okay yeah yeah he moved away from
[1884.64 → 1889.62] the mic okay all right I got a big surprise for you all and by the time you're watching this in the
[1889.62 → 1898.70] archive it will definitely be too late all right okay, okay okay uh was the president just calling to tell
[1898.70 → 1904.24] me to do this uh yes we are we are not going to war everything is okay that's good all right
[1904.24 → 1911.80] attention verified actual gamers you're not verified yet but if you're actual gamers there's a chance
[1911.80 → 1920.26] that in the next short while you will become verified we have a small wan show exclusive drop
[1920.26 → 1927.70] of Asus tough gaming AMD Radeon Rx 6800 x TOC edition graphics cards, and we are going to have these
[1927.70 → 1933.98] at MSRP now please do note MSRP on this card has gone up a fair bit since it launched
[1933.98 → 1941.16] due to uh supply shortages as well as component price increases, but this is still a lot less than
[1941.16 → 1948.72] what it would be one bay from a scalper monster who's who's extorting you, so this is a freaking
[1948.72 → 1954.84] sick GPU ladies and gentlemen runs it over two gigahertz has 16 gigs of gddr6 memory 4608 stream
[1954.84 → 1962.24] processors a triple fan 2.9 slot heat sink it's a thick boy it's a thick boy and features Asus's
[1962.24 → 1969.30] axial tech fans with a zero decibel mode and their aura RGB lighting it's got a vented backplate and
[1969.30 → 1975.52] I want to thank before I tell you guys any more I want to thank AMD and Asus for supporting the
[1975.52 → 1982.96] verified actual gamer program where I promise them I promise you every single card we've even had
[1982.96 → 1987.70] people cancel orders and all we've done with them, we've held on to them until we get a chance to put
[1987.70 → 1993.56] it in the hands of a verified actual gamer no one at no one at LTT no one on my staff no one who knows
[1993.56 → 1999.02] me in person can get their hands on it this is only people in the community I've had people on staff try
[1999.02 → 2003.98] to buy them they're like there are many flow plane members that want to get them can one go missing
[2003.98 → 2012.18] the answer is no you must pass the gamer gauntlet you must do it first they do 144 hour validation on
[2012.18 → 2016.40] these things for reliability out of the box which is good because if it dies the odds of you getting
[2016.40 → 2023.12] another one pretty slim so here it is ladies and gentlemen you can go challenge the gamer gauntlet now
[2023.12 → 2032.46] lttstore.com slash the brand of the chip okay so who is it that actually makes the chip on this
[2032.46 → 2040.70] graphics card three letters all right lttstore.com slash the brand of the chip the three letter name of
[2040.70 → 2048.84] this show the format that you are watching, so the hint is that it is not God okay it's not video on
[2048.84 → 2054.52] demand how you're watching right now ladies and gentlemen it's a four-letter word and the number of the month
[2054.52 → 2064.04] we are currently in lttstore.com slash the company that makes that radio chip three letters the show you
[2064.04 → 2070.60] are watching right now three letters the format you are watching in right now four letters and the number
[2070.60 → 2077.44] of the month that you are watching it in one number just in case that was just in case I was unclear
[2077.44 → 2084.86] not spelled out just great good luck gamers in the meantime let's blow through the Apple TV 4k refresh
[2084.86 → 2091.26] it's got the a12 bionic chip uh it's got 4k 60 HDR playback this is really cool this is a really neat
[2091.26 → 2098.06] feature so with the Apple TV 4k you can actually use your iPhone point it at your screen, and it will
[2098.06 → 2104.80] automatically calibrate its output based on the idiosyncrasies of your TV with the camera of your
[2104.80 → 2111.26] iPhone that's pretty cool right that's actually kind of sick yeah unfortunately because apple is apple
[2111.26 → 2118.32] and didn't you know think to have it actually interface with the uh the menu of your TV it won't work for
[2118.32 → 2125.32] any other devices that are hooked up to your TV, but it will work with your uh with your Apple TV so at least
[2125.32 → 2129.52] that'll be colour accurate so that's that's cool it's better than nothing for when you play fantasia
[2129.52 → 2133.22] which I still haven't played because i kind of want to play it on a different platform so I'm playing
[2133.22 → 2138.92] break the default instead now um comes with a new aluminum remote unfortunately doesn't contain the
[2138.92 → 2143.48] u1 chip so that you can find it like air tags which is unfortunate that seems like a missed opportunity
[2143.48 → 2149.02] yeah and the remote won't work with some games if anyone cares about that also there's a purple iPhone
[2149.02 → 2157.78] all right do you want to talk about the tile thing uh the tile thing is interesting uh people are mad and
[2157.78 → 2164.26] when Americans are mad they use lawyers, so there are lawyers involved um tile seeks to reinforce ongoing
[2164.26 → 2172.18] antitrust charges against apple and the air tags release um and this may help their cause tile sees air
[2172.18 → 2181.10] tags as a copycat product I can understand why no that seeks to squeeze tile out of the iOS ecosystem
[2181.10 → 2188.50] honestly when I saw the first screenshot of the air tag I thought it was a tile um apple recently opened
[2188.50 → 2195.68] the find my network uh system to third parties in order to head off anti-competitive complaints uh
[2195.68 → 2202.16] that probably isn't going to solve things though considering these notes that are following uh the
[2202.16 → 2208.56] tile took exception to what they call very strict terms and conditions likening it to a hostage program
[2208.56 → 2215.92] wow I'm surprised I'm super surprised after dealing with uh the Apple app store I'm very surprised that
[2215.92 → 2220.86] someone would think of it as a hostage program because that's exactly what it is uh this is referring to
[2220.86 → 2227.74] the fact that third parties cannot use their own apps to control find my functionality uh
[2227.74 → 2234.62] which is notably not how home kit works additionally apple hasn't fully opened you moved you want ultra
[2234.62 → 2239.76] wideband support to third parties making it impossible to compete with Apple devices like air
[2239.76 → 2247.02] tags very cool not surprised um also crucially tile has already announced an ultra-wideband tracker in
[2247.02 → 2254.78] January but has been unable to bring it to market thanks to USB restrictions um apple's responses are
[2254.78 → 2260.62] basically like oh no this is totally fine we did some of this stuff before you did, and you have 90 of
[2260.62 → 2266.22] the uh the market share anyway so it doesn't matter we've always embraced competition as the best way
[2266.22 → 2272.14] to drive great experiences for our customers yeah that's just another way of saying go yourself we don't
[2272.14 → 2279.66] care yeah, yeah pretty much yeah I mean there is another consideration if apple opened up you want
[2279.66 → 2285.58] access to third parties without any kind of validation there are a lot of potential privacy issues
[2285.58 → 2291.98] like Google also has an USB API in android that is similarly unavailable to third-party apps so
[2292.78 → 2301.02] as for who's right about this um I mean I don't know it gets into some muddy legal waters that I don't
[2301.02 → 2306.62] understand it's a funny thing because on the one hand like let's say that um you know YouTube uh
[2306.62 → 2312.78] entered implemented some kind of policy or some kind of business change that made it difficult for
[2312.78 → 2319.90] Linus media group to operate the reality of it is we built our business on someone else's platform
[2320.86 → 2328.86] so now we suffer the consequences of that, and it's not I'm not saying tile did something wrong I mean
[2328.86 → 2335.34] that was supposed to be what was so great about the iPhone was that it was this platform where
[2335.34 → 2342.62] whether you made uh you know a flashlight app or a level app or uh whatever app
[2343.18 → 2349.18] there was supposed to be money to be made in this ecosystem, but then you know obviously if you're
[2349.18 → 2353.98] apple kind of like Amazon does with Amazon basics on basics yeah if you see something on your platform
[2353.98 → 2358.94] that's performing really well that you think you could throw a small you know engineering team at
[2358.94 → 2364.78] and whip up in a year or two and then just take all the revenue for yourself why wouldn't you do it
[2365.34 → 2373.50] because maybe you don't want to be a big but I guess you do so that comes the brakes right i yeah I don't know
[2373.50 → 2382.54] how the law works here it seems like kind of a jerk move um but i, but that's what antitrust law is
[2382.54 → 2390.94] supposed to prevent it's supposed to prevent unfair competition so if you on the if on the basis
[2390.94 → 2401.02] of an of the idea being that this is a platform that um developers and product makers can come
[2401.02 → 2406.86] and participate in and compete in if that's the idea, and then you come in, and you have a first party
[2406.86 → 2413.74] competitor that has advantages that you don't give to anyone else that's supposed to be what antitrust
[2413.74 → 2419.90] law is supposed to address, and maybe it's this is just my paranoia but i just I don't I don't trust it
[2419.90 → 2425.58] you know like that's why we built float plane that's why we built a forum because I had no guarantee
[2426.14 → 2434.14] that google couldn't just turn me off at some point and that's a big part of why we do our everything uh
[2434.14 → 2440.78] all our merch all our drops on lttstore.com it's not like Amazon isn't an enormous marketplace that
[2440.78 → 2445.74] we could absolutely use when I called out that ABCs of gaming is on Amazon I think that was last week on
[2445.74 → 2453.58] wan show we sold all 150 copies that we had in stock so fast that Amazon's recommended restock for us
[2453.58 → 2456.86] was more than we were allowed to restock
[2459.50 → 2467.66] so this is great nick sent me the best message earlier uh here hold on a second let's see if I can
[2467.66 → 2471.58] while you're doing that I'll just say like I have no idea where the law lands on this or anything like
[2471.58 → 2478.30] that all I would say is that I hope if this does go through, and they go after and and and like apple takes
[2478.30 → 2485.02] takes a blow for this I hope they look at Amazon um I hope whoever whatever lawyers they had
[2485.02 → 2491.26] behind this take a look at Amazon because holy crap they've been doing the exact same thing um and just
[2491.26 → 2499.42] as bad or worse for years so yep it's some serious humbuggery and I'm really not that into it now uh this
[2499.42 → 2506.30] is really cool I've actually got the message that nick sent me for you guys here uh can you see
[2506.30 → 2515.66] this Luke so it says recommended quantity 828, and then it says we put in 828, and it goes this product
[2515.66 → 2520.38] exceeds the allowed quantity for standard size storage click the restock limits monitor to view
[2520.38 → 2526.06] the maximum shipment quantity for the standard size storage it's like you literally you told me
[2526.86 → 2535.10] to get this many of them but when it's a new item Amazon only allows so many so they asked us to do
[2535.10 → 2542.06] what we couldn't do because they told us we couldn't do if it's like okay sure so it seems
[2542.06 → 2547.26] like a pretty simple thing to fix and that's weird as long as you're reliant on somebody else's
[2547.26 → 2551.02] platform that's always going to be the way that it is you want to do something like verified actual
[2551.02 → 2554.86] gamer program there's no way we could build that through Amazon that's something that we were only
[2554.86 → 2560.70] able to do with the help of the float plane team and by integrating it into a separate platform like
[2560.70 → 2566.30] Shopify where we actually have at least some degree of control, and it's not perfect to be very clear
[2566.30 → 2572.94] like developing for Shopify there's a reason that you know it's kind of considered to be half science
[2572.94 → 2578.86] half a little bit of black magic um what's up Luke uh just yeah
[2578.86 → 2582.86] yeah
[2583.98 → 2590.30] but at least it's better than being entirely dependent on someone else's you know black box
[2590.30 → 2597.18] you know what I mean yeah at least they do let you do things like you, it yeah all right so thank you
[2597.18 → 2602.94] verified gamers I'm actually just looking at my Shopify dashboard right now and I think that's probably

[2610.54 → 2619.50] news for you guys if you didn't get one we will have an accompanying drop coming up with the other 270
[2619.50 → 2625.74] of those cards there's going to be more we knew they have not all sold oh they haven't well okay but
[2625.74 → 2632.62] if you're not already queued there's no way um, but we knew that this one was going to be a total mad
[2632.62 → 2637.50] rush and that's the reason that we haven't typically done them live on wan show because we know you guys
[2637.50 → 2644.22] are dialled in all we have to do is mention you know an available domain name and within seconds it's been
[2644.22 → 2651.26] snapped up and redirected to ltcstore.com so like we know you guys are on it which is why we only did 30.
[2651.26 → 2657.34] we didn't want to just we didn't want to just have them all go to the wan show audience sorry we have
[2657.34 → 2662.78] lots and lots of actual gamers out there who don't necessarily tune into wan show so we want to make sure
[2662.78 → 2667.58] that they get a crack at it spread the love yeah metal gap he says to everyone that got a card
[2667.58 → 2674.30] congratulations and I hope you enjoy them thank you metal gap he that is exactly what we're trying to do here
[2675.58 → 2680.94] all right um Sikhs says only 30 that's right it was only 30.

[2688.06 → 2695.66] wan show today all right why don't we uh what is going on what is happening to my wait did I open
[2695.66 → 2703.74] the wrong oh I opened the wrong browser window so I was like all my tabs were like kind of right but um
[2703.74 → 2709.34] sometimes when I restart or if chrome crashes or whatever you know how you can open up your previous
[2709.34 → 2714.94] 20 tabs or whatever yeah sometimes it'll like to do it twice for whatever reason so I'll have two
[2714.94 → 2721.66] almost identical Chrome windows oh weird and so this one i the one I'm using right now I had like
[2721.66 → 2727.58] you know gone to the wan show document in my Google Docs tab and I had gone to the float plane chat
[2727.58 → 2732.46] dashboard and my float plane tab and all that kind of stuff and I accidentally pulled up the wrong one
[2732.46 → 2736.70] when I moved it out of the way so that I could show everyone that message from nick and I pulled up the
[2736.70 → 2741.02] old one I was like all these tabs are right but I'm just what's going on yeah I'm in the wrong I'm

[2847.66 → 2854.06] the highest it goes uh lambda noise level a plus their talking points are hilarious basically
[2854.06 → 2860.14] means your noise output stays below 20 decibels during operation so it's functionally silent um they

[2896.46 → 2903.98] right I mean they might not all be good maybe some of them are total crap heads uh, so these are super cool
[2905.18 → 2906.86] guess who makes go-karts
[2910.70 → 2917.74] I don't have a single clue okay nine bot nine bots makes a go-kart
[2917.74 → 2926.70] go-kart this is the nine bot go-kart pro and oh Segway yeah they bought Segway so
[2928.46 → 2938.94] it is a drift monster, and we got four of them it's got like these super kind of slick back tires
[2938.94 → 2946.54] and then like grippier front ones uh it's actually powered by a rear wheel drive
[2946.54 → 2950.54] uh four different modes so it'll do up to 23 miles an hour in race mode
[2951.18 → 2956.78] and uh what was the other aerodynamic rear wing okay that's not much of a feature and then it actually
[2956.78 → 2964.46] converts into where is it you can pull out the drive unit at the back, and it converts into what is it
[2964.46 → 2977.26] called like an s uh yeah I think it's nine bot s yeah one of these things it's crazy this thing is crazy
[2977.98 → 2986.54] so I brought it home uh for my kids to try and okay to be clear I don't recommend this will not be in the email
[2986.54 → 2995.18] um in the email or in the email in the video about it but this is so funny okay so this is me uh ripping
[2995.18 → 3002.06] down our street with my daughter in my lap oh a second why is my uh why is my auto rotate not on
[3002.06 → 3006.06] because I'm some kind of monster I guess hold on okay see if you guys can hear this
[3006.06 → 3014.78] why is this wow, wow that's wow why is this is awesome why does it not default to have audio I freaking
[3016.06 → 3020.14] i kind of hate this thing okay so we're ripping
[3023.18 → 3024.78] is it uh is it lagging
[3024.78 → 3040.78] man the expression on her face when we were just like ripping down the street man there's not many
[3040.78 → 3050.46] sounds that are more pure joy than a little kid going fast and probably the cutest thing about it
[3050.46 → 3055.66] was at each speed I would take her, and she'd be like to go as fast as we can, we'd go we'd rip down in
[3055.66 → 3063.82] a straight line and then um I'd get back and I'd be like can I tell you a secret, and she goes yeah and I go
[3064.46 → 3071.90] it goes faster, and she's like ha ha ha, and she'll laugh can we do it I'm like okay, and then we'd go we'd rip
[3071.90 → 3079.18] and it'd be like was that fun she'd be like yeah and I'd be like to let me tell you a secret okay it goes faster
[3080.46 → 3088.14] and she just laughed like that so funny man little kids man it's uh I'm not going to try and sell you
[3088.14 → 3093.42] on it because I know you got you know you got your thing you got your thing, but it's its I'm into it
[3093.42 → 3102.22] hold on this is i think I have one of those here oh why is the sound off I hate you so much okay
[3102.22 → 3112.54] okay oh nope never mind I think uh I think we didn't catch that anyway it was hilarious
[3113.34 → 3117.74] um, so yeah super cool we're going to have a short circuit coming where we rip around in the parking
[3117.74 → 3121.98] lot and the thing is guys I actually wanted to talk to the community about this because I don't know
[3121.98 → 3131.58] exactly what to do with it like would you guys watch a review of a go-kart like we could have
[3131.58 → 3136.30] Alex and Jake give their thoughts you know like they know what's up yeah yeah you could go way over
[3136.30 → 3143.66] the top and like benchmark it I mean we could I I don't know if you could find one weak enough maybe
[3143.66 → 3150.54] you could but like you could like Dino it man I don't even know if you could Dino it but uh we
[3150.54 → 3156.38] could definitely do zero to 60. Well I mean it doesn't do 60. It maxes out at like 37 kilometres
[3156.38 → 3162.54] zero to 35. yeah, zero to you know zero to 20 miles an hour or whatever like it really has some kick off
[3162.54 → 3168.22] the line it does about 1g of acceleration according to the spec sheet, but we could verify that obviously
[3168.22 → 3175.50] um Andy is actually perfect like when we went to the local indoor go-karting place he was
[3176.86 → 3184.06] like him and Alex just put the rest of us to absolute shame okay YouTube chat is pretty much
[3184.06 → 3191.10] unanimous here they're like yes do it like a car review yeah I mean that's a possibility we could go
[3191.10 → 3197.58] totally over the top and just we have four of them I wonder if you could convince
[3198.46 → 3205.82] like a local go-kart place to let you like pit it against theirs yeah maybe our best driver
[3205.82 → 3212.06] traditional yeah your best driver interesting okay you know what yeah we'll consider it we're
[3212.06 → 3216.46] definitely going to do the short circuit uh we could do a channel super fun or something like that
[3216.46 → 3222.38] that'd be pretty that'd be pretty cool uh but otherwise maybe we actually do it in the style of
[3222.38 → 3226.62] our car reviews or something like that the challenge with that though is we have
[3226.62 → 3230.94] a lot of cars lined up we're supposed to be doing one every two months that's our target which we
[3230.94 → 3237.10] obviously haven't done so far this year we haven't shot anything yet this year, but we've got a ton of
[3237.10 → 3242.22] stuff lined up I think the next one's going to be the Tynan and from there it's going to be like
[3243.18 → 3250.14] one after another after another there are so many electric cars coming out right now um living says
[3250.14 → 3257.42] it would get roasted by a two-stroke cart I mean it depends maybe in a straight line but remember this is
[3257.42 → 3264.78] electric son like when you're coming out of a corner this is not and there's a lot of that on go-kart
[3264.78 → 3272.70] tracks yes that's basically how a go-kart track works so I don't know you might not actually be right about that
[3273.74 → 3278.30] and if not that's still an interesting story like it doesn't have to win for it to be an interesting story
[3278.30 → 3283.74] yeah uh there are a couple other things I promised I'd talk about so I might be doing a pc build with
[3283.74 → 3292.94] a basketball star and I'm talking like NBA like an actual like yeah what okay household name so how did this
[3292.94 → 3300.70] happen uh it was actually one of the hardware partners that we work with who is working on a thing where
[3300.70 → 3308.06] they want this basketball star to do a build but I think the idea was that I'm there to come in
[3308.06 → 3317.18] and act as kind of like a guiding hand and make sure that a's like entertaining to watch and b
[3317.98 → 3324.62] it's um it's more educational so the way that I see it I actually had a call with this person today
[3324.62 → 3329.58] and you know what until we've actually shot it I don't want to guarantee anything because life happens
[3329.58 → 3334.22] right like stuff happens it might be no fault of their own maybe they can't do it and I don't want to
[3334.22 → 3338.94] put them in an awkward position where all of a sudden you know I called them out saying they
[3338.94 → 3343.10] would they would build a pc with me, and then they don't do it and they know get pressured or
[3343.10 → 3347.74] whatever I don't want anything like that but I had a call with them today and I think it's going to be
[3347.74 → 3358.86] great because um the guy's personality is like super chill easy going um genuinely wants to learn like this is not about
[3358.86 → 3365.98] like me building a pc for him, we're going to do it kind of like rogue rig reboot but in reverse so instead
[3365.98 → 3373.10] of him being on the call and me being the hands he's going to build it and I'm just there to coach him
[3373.10 → 3378.62] through it so when we're done he will have built his own gaming pc and honestly the story is great
[3378.62 → 3383.90] because he's like yeah I mean you know I've always been kind of into console gaming but with the lockdown
[3383.90 → 3389.98] it's like I thought maybe there's another world out there and i kind of started getting into pc
[3389.98 → 3396.14] gaming and I really like it now I want to build my own pc gaming pc I'm stuck in hotels all the time
[3396.14 → 3403.58] because travel and covid so let's let's do this and I'm like this is great heck yeah because what i
[3403.58 → 3410.62] like about it is this is like an Everyman pc build and I don't mean that in the sense that
[3410.62 → 3419.66] like a star basketball athlete is an Everyman on a basketball court but when it comes to building a pc
[3420.78 → 3427.10] he's an Everyman okay so I talk about this a lot where it's really easy for the pc community
[3427.10 → 3434.94] to be really kind of you know look down your nose at people who don't even know what kind of DDR goes in
[3434.94 → 3440.54] the motherboards for this socket you know what I mean, but you got to understand for most people
[3440.54 → 3448.86] they spend their life doing something else whether it's being focused on cooking or family or or or
[3448.86 → 3453.82] work, or they're really into you know uh home renovation and construction whatever there's a
[3453.82 → 3459.66] thousand other things that they know better than you do and this is such a perfect example of someone
[3459.66 → 3467.50] whose life has clearly been about something else, and so he's going to come in, and he's going to ask every
[3467.50 → 3475.02] stupid question that everyone else has, and they're afraid to ask and because he's someone that is
[3475.02 → 3482.22] already looked up to for his skill for his ability for his hard work in some other area of his
[3482.22 → 3487.34] life I think that's going to make the whole scene more approachable for other people and that's what's
[3487.34 → 3493.74] making me really excited about it for sure yeah definitely you know like oh well if he who's obviously a
[3493.74 → 3500.14] literal actual master of this other thing has to ask this dumb question well now I don't feel dumb
[3500.14 → 3505.34] you know what I mean and so that was what the meeting today was about us getting to kind of
[3505.34 → 3512.30] talk a little bit because I don't encounter a lot of like you know basketball stars in my daily life
[3512.30 → 3518.70] uh and I think the same probably goes the other way for tech nerds um, so the idea was that we get to
[3518.70 → 3523.98] know each other a little bit and I got a perfect vibe that he's going to be down to just ask
[3523.98 → 3530.78] the dumb questions and have me explain it like I'm five so that everyone else can not have to feel
[3530.78 → 3535.66] like that, and so I thought that was super cool and I'm really excited I'm really excited to work with
[3535.66 → 3541.58] them awesome um there's a note in here I highly suggest getting titan fall 2 on steam yes oh this is
[3541.58 → 3548.70] from you okay this is for me okay so it's its 10 bucks, but that's that's not even the biggest point
[3548.70 → 3556.38] so I haven't talked about this on the show too much but i for me, I genuinely think the single player
[3556.94 → 3562.22] from titan fall 2 is the best single player of any shooter I have ever played in my life
[3563.82 → 3569.50] like hands down and I've pretty much played basically all of them because I really like single
[3569.50 → 3575.66] player shooters um I have said this a lot and basically everyone puts their nose up and then
[3575.66 → 3581.74] just ignores me to the point where I have basically sat multiple people down and made them play the damn
[3581.74 → 3587.10] game so they can experience if it's pretty short so it's not too it's not too bad to do and so far
[3587.10 → 3591.18] every single person that I have done that with has then co-opted my opinion on the game
[3592.62 → 3598.86] okay so it's just 10 bucks I think you should try it the story of this game is freaking tragic
[3598.86 → 3604.46] back in whenever the heck when they released it, it was released right in between these other games
[3604.46 → 3607.82] were released like a week apart or something I don't remember exactly what, but it's very close
[3607.82 → 3612.78] cod and battlefield yeah it was released right in the middle of those two and with no advertising it
[3612.78 → 3619.02] was terrible, and it's an incredibly awesome game since it's been added to steam its player count has been
[3619.02 → 3624.46] blowing up so if you want to check out the online scene it's very popular right now and if you only
[3624.46 → 3630.94] bought it for the single player that price is absolutely worth it, so please try it yeah it's
[3630.94 → 3635.66] an incredible game and that that studio they're the guys that made apex a lot of the people that come
[3635.66 → 3640.06] from that studio came from the original halo games you can imagine that they might make a pretty good
[3640.06 → 3645.18] single player game um it's yeah it's good stuff yeah you're getting a lot of backup in the float
[3645.18 → 3651.74] plane chat here so titan fall two guys 10 bucks on steam yeah and the reviews the recent reviews are
[3651.74 → 3656.38] overwhelmingly positive and the all-time reviews are overwhelmingly positive like it's a fantastic
[3656.38 → 3663.58] game, and it deserves more so check it out all right we've got another kind of topic that we need to
[3663.58 → 3671.18] talk through um out of nowhere a Canada computers employee is blowing a whistle on the company's
[3671.18 → 3681.18] alleged substantial stock of GeForce RTX 3000s that they are refusing to sell despite having taken
[3681.18 → 3687.82] back orders um the allegation is that many stores have stopped getting new shipments of 30 series GPUs
[3687.82 → 3694.46] all together why after it became oh we should have totally done this topic before the verified
[3694.46 → 3699.82] actual gamer program drop probably, but that's okay why is after it became clear that the GPUs would
[3699.82 → 3705.02] be in short supply allocations that should have gone to stores or would have gone to stores were apparently
[3705.02 → 3711.90] held at head office for a new custom build program now here's the thing margins on GPUs are low like
[3711.90 → 3717.74] I'm going to tell you guys a little secret here hold on let me bring up my Shopify dashboard okay so our
[3717.74 → 3725.50] sales today uh with those 30 cards that we added to it that's so that's a thousand dollars right times 30
[3725.50 → 3733.74] cards that's that's thirty thousand dollars that's a lot of money but get this even though our revenue
[3733.74 → 3743.90] today hold on let me look at yesterday is up substantially our profit is actually oh no
[3744.78 → 3753.50] I only look at this on mobile and the layout is slightly different on I've become that guy I only look
[3753.50 → 3762.06] at it on uh I only look at these reports on my phone uh okay yeah so our profit today is let me check
[3762.06 → 3770.62] against yesterday wow just over half even though our sales are much higher because there is no
[3770.62 → 3777.66] flipping margin in graphics cards so why are why is Canada computers allegedly holding these cards and
[3777.66 → 3783.42] headquarters well because if they sell the graphics card as part of a system that has other components
[3783.42 → 3789.74] they can actually make money on like cases power supplies fans then they can make way more money as a
[3789.74 → 3795.42] whole because they're the ones that have GPUs, so people can buy their systems now because there's
[3795.42 → 3800.86] there's people that there's a strategy that's being pushed by the community actually which is to
[3800.86 → 3806.94] buy these systems and then flip the other parts now allegedly these builds are hastily thrown together
[3806.94 → 3813.02] to mean more service calls I don't know if I would necessarily buy that and the op says that head office
[3813.02 → 3821.66] wants to end back orders full stop and just do build now here's a hot take there's a hot take and a half
[3822.38 → 3833.42] okay Luke yeah I have personally with these two hands walked into the back and hand allocated
[3833.42 → 3839.66] incoming graphics cards for systems I have done it
[3843.02 → 3843.90] so what
[3848.70 → 3853.18] well I think the issue here is that they're on yes like they have accepted orders right like it's a bit
[3853.18 → 3859.10] different so that's the difference that's what we're getting into okay so when I was at NCI
[3859.10 → 3867.02] I would not have done that if there was already an order for the product NCI did a lot of things wrong
[3867.66 → 3875.98] but not honouring FIFO was not at least in the time that I was there was not one of them so FIFO means first in
[3876.54 → 3883.98] first out your first order in is your first order out and one of the things that NCI
[3883.98 → 3889.82] NCI didn't do well was that they would actually take people's money on back orders where they
[3889.82 → 3895.58] weren't a hundred percent sure when it would come, but the redeeming quality was that when the bloody
[3895.58 → 3901.82] thing came at least you got your part they also didn't have a very good system for like if we had an
[3901.82 → 3909.98] VGA KO and an VGA SSC and the KO was way back ordered and the SSC was only like 10 more dollars and
[3909.98 → 3914.46] we got a ton of these, and we had a ton of back orders of these we wouldn't unless it was super
[3914.46 → 3919.42] bad super allocated it was done very manually we wouldn't say we wouldn't go pull these and say
[3919.42 → 3923.18] okay hey we need to contact all those guys see if they want to upgrade for 10 bucks that's something
[3923.18 → 3929.74] they didn't do a good job of either but at least we did FIFO so here's the problem is that Canada
[3929.74 → 3936.46] computers has taken these orders, and they are allegedly sitting on thousands of dollars worth of paid back
[3936.46 → 3943.82] orders that can't uh that can be fulfilled, but they won't even they won't do it because they're
[3943.82 → 3949.90] waiting around for people to buy an entire system a now deleted custom sop outlines the following
[3950.54 → 3956.06] all custom build packages with a shortage item are final sale defective exchange can happen only within
[3956.06 → 3962.70] the first 30 days of purchase parts can't be greater than 45 percent of total cost so you can't put a
[3962.70 → 3969.98] 900 GPU in a 2 000 build must have CPU motherboard ram case and storage and custom
[3969.98 → 3974.22] builds must be a hundred percent paid for before the parts will ship okay that I understand that
[3974.22 → 3978.94] makes sense of course now this is interesting Anthony actually has a hot take in here to the shop i
[3978.94 → 3983.50] worked at pulled parts off the shelf as needed for new builds and most people expect cc to do this too
[3983.50 → 3988.38] it wouldn't be controversial if these were is allocations, but they are retail cards but I guarantee this
[3988.38 → 3994.14] is more common than we think and that's a very good point because one of the big final pushes that
[3994.14 → 4001.42] sealed the deal for me on doing verified actual gamer program was the RTX 3060 launch NVIDIA told me
[4001.42 → 4009.26] there are lots board partners told me there are lots retailers told me there aren't any and i kind of went
[4012.14 → 4018.14] now NVIDIA's response to that was well hey you're probably talking to like rink link shops and I was
[4018.14 → 4026.30] like you think I'm an idiot i I don't know I don't know where to buy a graphics card like what kind
[4026.30 → 4034.70] of answer is that obviously I know where to get a graphics card like thank you very much um so no
[4035.34 → 4040.94] something went wrong hence verified actual gamer program I mean I don't know I don't know maybe
[4040.94 → 4045.90] NVIDIA cares maybe they don't uh I did invite them to join the verified actual gamer program and they
[4045.90 → 4051.42] politely declined so I don't know they also have probably their own separate reasons for not
[4051.42 → 4058.46] wanting to work with me but uh whatever it is whatever it is uh hey we're going to have a radon
[4058.46 → 4066.38] drop coming in the next little bit here 270 cards Rx 6800 XT um so thank you very much AMD for actually
[4066.38 → 4074.14] giving it and well I guess that's it I guess that's all I can say about that yeah what I would probably
[4074.14 → 4079.98] say is there's there's we're fairly certain there's more bad going on behind the
[4079.98 → 4086.46] scenes than this and this is a bit more well I think it's still a problem because of the like
[4086.46 → 4092.46] they're they're already backordered by customers' thing I have no issue whatsoever with companies
[4092.46 → 4097.42] taking stuff off the shelf in order to build systems if that thing isn't sold who cares that
[4097.98 → 4101.42] means nothing to me at all I don't think that's a problem the slightest and I don't think anyone in the
[4101.42 → 4105.50] community cares about that either but if they are already sold they shouldn't be taking those things
[4105.50 → 4110.14] and putting them in systems um but yeah there 's's there's more going on than this that's
[4110.14 → 4116.22] yeah that's where we'll leave it and I think that's where we're going to leave the show today thank you
[4116.22 → 4121.50] very much for tuning in ladies and gentlemen I hope you all enjoyed it wait I think I said we were
[4121.50 → 4127.18] going to talk about project x cloud, but we didn't uh, uh okay it's in beta on pc and iOS game pass
[4127.18 → 4130.14] ultimate subscribers will be invited over the course of the beta it's browser-based with support for
[4130.14 → 4133.18] multiple leading web browsers like chrome safari and of course edge there's no firm date on when
[4133.18 → 4136.38] the service will go live for everyone allegedly it feels like x cloud on android so you can expect
[4136.38 → 4141.74] latency and input issues it's running similar to what the Xbox One S has which is jaguar 8 core
[4141.74 → 4145.90] blah blah blah blah blah blah load times are rough due to hard drive why would they put a hard drive in
[4145.90 → 4151.98] it okay and also the series x and series s are getting AMD fidelity FX um wow that's cool which
[4151.98 → 4157.98] narrows the gap between a pc version and an Xbox version that's cool man Xbox there you man Microsoft is
[4157.98 → 4163.74] just like oh no way they removed the Xbox Live gold subscription requirements for multiplayer and
[4163.74 → 4168.78] free-to-play titles yes I thought it was some free-to-play titles but I'm not I'm not maybe
[4168.78 → 4173.58] it maybe it is all I'm not sure if there are going to be a lot of shrieking children in microphones
[4173.58 → 4178.38] over the next little bit I'm I hate to be the latest but man when Team Fortress 2 went free-to-play
[4178.38 → 4185.34] that game died to me, it was yeah yeah I'm sorry this it was a different flow play knows it's a
[4185.34 → 4192.22] different community that pays for a service yes this is flow plane is highly aware of that yeah
[4192.22 → 4196.46] they're aware of just the difference in community all right let's go ahead and get through some super
[4196.46 → 4203.18] chats then Robert mail says Lola bunny collab confirmed question mark um you know no you know
[4203.18 → 4211.58] the Lola bunny redesign is totally unacceptable we can't, we can't stand for it rise up gamers can you even
[4211.58 → 4217.50] you know I'm not even gonna you know what I'm just going to say that whole thing ridiculous and then
[4217.50 → 4222.38] I'm just not going to say any more uh grizzly garage says there's only one man who can break into apple
[4223.18 → 4229.42] Tim apple wait what okay I don't get it apple get it because yeah okay Luke regardless of what
[4229.42 → 4236.14] what anyone says keep that moustache oh no we were going to acknowledge it um gamba it's actually been
[4236.14 → 4245.90] exhausting trying to ignore it the whole show it's in my sight line sorry okay, okay okay gamba says fox
[4245.90 → 4251.42] finance to the moon I have no idea what that is, but it sounds like probably spam that I probably shouldn't
[4251.42 → 4256.38] have read uh Charles says Linus less repairable isn't necessarily awful for the environment
[4257.58 → 4264.06] less repairability leads people to upgrade to more energy efficient devices and makes devices more durable
[4264.06 → 4266.54] more accessible extending their lifetime
[4271.34 → 4271.74] huh
[4273.82 → 4278.94] profits business guru says saw your stream talking about Amazon how complex it is we specialize in this
[4278.94 → 4285.66] and bought three tumblers to shoot some optimized Amazon photos for us who can I reach out to at Ltd to
[4285.66 → 4290.54] talk about your Amazon store you could just reach out to uh, uh Ltd store support actually I don't know
[4290.54 → 4297.90] maybe they'll want to talk to you um maybe man since when are the super chats like other businesses
[4297.90 → 4302.30] reaching out to me about stuff tails says this is my first super chat ever love your work watch for
[4302.30 → 4309.02] years also subbed on float plane keep it up hey thanks tails um thank you funny hat says update on the
[4309.02 → 4315.90] real PMP 300 bounty YouTuber dank pods appears to have one yeah dank pods yeah yeah I think we already
[4315.90 → 4321.26] have one but thank you very much uh I found out what happened with that dank pods did reach out to us
[4321.26 → 4326.30] and it went straight to spam Colton sent me a screenshot today so dank pods you have to find out
[4326.30 → 4331.42] why your email is going to spam dog I don't know why, but we didn't block you or anything it just was
[4331.42 → 4340.94] automatically flagged um nice john bray love if it's a cool story bro z storm as a daily driver of the note
[4340.94 → 4345.66] nine are you aware of the green tint issue that Enos variants develop after updating to android 10.
[4345.66 → 4353.34] no and I don't have an Enos variant so I probably won't see it uh spleen be gone tried to get one for
[4353.34 → 4357.58] a friend that just built a computer looks like I missed out have ten dollars instead oh, thanks spleen be
[4357.58 → 4364.14] gone uh dBm says channel super fun lap time stop competition yeah I'd love to do like a channel super
[4364.14 → 4370.70] fun thing with it maybe we could like to rent an indoor track uh you probably could the orca says
[4370.94 → 4378.14] I bought a used 2060 from an angry parent today off Craigslist for its original price
[4378.78 → 4387.26] I get home turns out to be a 3060. I called they did not even care I'm so happy I feel the need to
[4387.26 → 4395.58] throw money at you guys don't off mom I would say I feel bad for that kid but from the sounds of it the
[4395.58 → 4403.66] kid didn't buy it so wow don't piss off mom obscure paradox says first time catching the stream live
[4403.66 → 4410.06] massive fan ever considered doing IOC if so happy to lend all the equipment what the devil is IOC
[4412.54 → 4420.62] like VGA's overclocking software or yeah that's what that doesn't make much sense to me though I wonder
[4420.62 → 4428.06] if you're done typed your 20 super chat dog that's a little awkward um it's a Mayan word for fish okay
[4429.18 → 4433.98] could Bill Gates build a gaming pc hmm says Leandro that would actually be a very fun collab I'd be
[4433.98 → 4442.78] super down to do it extreme overland camping I have no idea not a clue dude people are trying to guess
[4442.78 → 4448.14] the NBA player that we're going to collab with I will not confirm or deny until we have actually shot it
[4449.02 → 4456.30] uh Denny Martel says got a 5900x and now a 6800xt thanks you are now officially verified gamer
[4456.30 → 4462.54] programmed out we are allowing duplicates on CPU and GPU, but we are not allowing duplicates on two of
[4462.54 → 4468.54] the same thing so yeah so you're allowed to win twice if they are entirely different products as in as
[4469.26 → 4474.22] entirely different product sections it's not a duplicate you don't get to get two CPUs and two GPUs yes
[4474.22 → 4480.86] correct one CPU one GPU oh people are like extreme overclocking oh like dry ice liquid nitrogen all
[4480.86 → 4488.38] that kind of stuff you know it's one of those things that's never really appealed to me neither hot
[4488.38 → 4501.26] I just don't care it's so like I'm into impractical I would even i we have done a phase change build guide before
[4501.26 → 4512.46] but to me if it's something that you have to continuously top up it's just not um it's just
[4512.46 → 4518.86] not interesting uh like it's interesting in terms of I'll look at other people doing it and I'll be
[4518.86 → 4525.82] like whoa great result that is so cool and I will genuinely mean it but do you guys have any idea how
[4525.82 → 4535.10] tedious it actually is to actually do it like all the minutiae of you know adjusting this stupid thing
[4535.10 → 4544.70] and this other stupid thing and yeah i just can't care I'm sorry it's not to run 24 7. he that
[4544.70 → 4551.74] that's the point right he knows that's why I don't care like to be clear it's not that I'm not crazy i
[4551.74 → 4561.82] literally ran a chiller as a daily driver I took a like you know two foot by three foot chiller with
[4561.82 → 4569.58] my gaming pc okay my e6600 overclocked to like whatever the crap it was I took it to a land party
[4569.58 → 4576.38] okay they had to get a separate circuit for my station so that it wouldn't trip the breaker it was
[4576.38 → 4584.54] very kind of them but I daily drove it 24 7 baby if it ain't 24 7 I just don't give a that's just all
[4584.54 → 4593.74] there is to it, I'm sorry and that's it I'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[4593.74 → 4606.30] oh we've got people asking if all the cards are reserved oh yes quite quickly we knew that this
[4606.30 → 4612.86] is going to be the most dialled in possible audience, and they were going to be moving as fast as possible
[4613.74 → 4620.38] um Robert Adams says if a NBA player is collabing with you, it's obviously going to be a bench warmer
[4620.38 → 4626.06] who's got a maximum of 15 seconds of career playing time on the court what is the point of
[4626.06 → 4633.26] tuning into a channel to say something like that, and they want to contribute to you and make you
[4633.90 → 4638.30] uh a bigger and better creator uh, but they also want to belittle you so they can feel better about
[4638.30 → 4643.42] themselves unbelievable all right well um see you later ladies and gentlemen
[4643.42 → 4652.22] uh for the person that asked if there was a queue after Linus told people that it would be too late
[4652.22 → 4658.22] by then and that they should just leave the queue it was still at over 2 000 people in line so
[4658.70 → 4665.42] there's definitely a queue oh yeah yeah yeah
