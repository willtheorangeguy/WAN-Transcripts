The first two timestamps were definitely real. Eyelids, lips, little contractions in the chin, the way the skin behaves in general. For as long as we've come, we've not come nearly as close to natural facial skin and muscle movement as we'd like. There is no doubt, that the first two timestamps of Jensen are 100% his real face. And by the looks of it his real head too.

it was the lip syncing that gave it away on the last timestamp.  seen better in games from 2005
