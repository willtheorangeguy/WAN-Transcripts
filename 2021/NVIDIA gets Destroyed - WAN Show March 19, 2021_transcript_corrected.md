[0.00 → 6.40] you got this and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic
[6.40 → 13.36] show for you guys today starting of course with NVIDIA's spectacular self-own this week
[13.36 → 22.40] with their RTX 3060 unhackable mining limited driver getting hacked but also not really hacked
[22.40 → 29.04] so we'll talk a little bit more about that later we've also got AMD launching the Rx 6700 XT which
[29.04 → 34.40] hasn't had its mining capabilities nerfed but quite frankly didn't need any of its capabilities nerfed
[36.08 → 43.52] yay what else we got uh 11th gen core lineup has been released because we definitely wanted to
[43.52 → 49.68] keep saying products uh names that sound somewhat like the previous generation at all that's very
[49.68 → 58.56] cool I'm excited to say 11 700 and stuff like that um and also where did it go I wanted to ah yes
[58.56 → 64.80] google slashes play stores uh play store fees with a you know with a twist of course
[64.80 → 71.60] interesting oh wow that's actually that's very interesting okay i I had not looked at that so
[71.60 → 80.64] let's roll the intro
[95.36 → 100.32] man I love that it says the time of the show, and it's just like yeah the show kind of happens whenever
[100.32 → 104.24] it happens I think there's a between daylight savings time and the fact that we were super
[104.24 → 109.60] late last week and a little early this week there's like a four-hour difference between the show start
[109.60 → 116.16] time from one week to the next thank-you guys very much for your patience with us um let's jump right
[116.16 → 123.12] into our headline topic because otherwise people get upset the unhackable RTX 3060 has been hacked for
[123.12 → 130.00] those of you who haven't been following what's been going on with the RTX 3060 NVIDIA said in the lead
[130.00 → 137.92] up to the release of this card that the driver firmware and uh yeah I think it's mostly down to
[137.92 → 143.36] the driver and firmware of the card we're going to have a handshake that we're basically going to make
[143.36 → 150.72] it so that the card would be able to detect if it was mining Ethereum and then throttle its performance
[150.72 → 158.80] in that particular workload until it's stopped, and it goes back to gaming or rendering or whatever
[158.80 → 166.80] the case may be and NVIDIA said that because there's this firmware driver uh handshake that's
[166.80 → 174.24] taking place, and it's all it's all encrypted and validated and whatever that this uh this performance
[174.24 → 178.80] lock would be unhackable, and they said the goal of this endeavour was to make it
[178.80 → 188.08] it so that RTX 3060s would not be appealing to miners um hopefully decreasing the demand for them
[188.08 → 194.88] from uh from scalpers making it so that gamers could buy them at a reasonable price um of course
[194.88 → 202.56] we talked through sort of why uh NVIDIA's actions seem to have more to do with protecting their bottom
[202.56 → 209.68] line and less to do with actually protecting gamers from opportunistic scalpers um, but you can
[209.68 → 215.60] watch the whole video about that if you really want to um but one of the things we also talked about was
[215.60 → 224.56] that NVIDIA's actions here uh not only don't really do anything to protect gamers uh yeah we didn't think
[224.56 → 232.40] they were going to do anything to prevent miners from utilizing these cards and one of the big key steps in
[232.88 → 242.48] defeating NVIDIA's uh cryptocurrency mining block has already taken place now usually something getting
[243.04 → 249.84] hacked is not as simple as just like you know you get into the get into the mainframe, and you get
[249.84 → 255.84] the control all delete in there really fast and then suddenly you get the matrix code coming down it's not
[255.84 → 261.36] usually the way it works I mean you look like uh you look at a project like uh the iPhone it's its a
[261.36 → 265.52] never-ending battle because there's always new hardware there's always new software updates there's
[265.52 → 271.12] always new workarounds, and it's like this game of cat and mouse so you look at something that where
[271.12 → 275.44] the hardware doesn't change uh you know something like a Nintendo console you know you go back to the
[275.44 → 283.52] r4 cards on the DS or uh you look at the android um uh the android uh I don't know what to call it
[283.52 → 288.48] yeah I guess it's probably a hack the android hack on the Nintendo Switch uh those are things that
[288.48 → 297.12] little by little by little uh what is usually a very dedicated and usually very small
[297.12 → 304.40] community chips away so you know first they need to uh pass some key hurdles they need to get you
[304.40 → 309.92] know like root access for example they need to break the bootloader like they need to kind of get past
[309.92 → 314.80] these hurdles and then once they do that it's like oh yay now we've got android running on it uh because
[314.80 → 321.28] it's just a Terra chip so like obviously it could run on it but oh wait you know NVIDIA uh NVIDIA
[321.28 → 327.68] excuse me Nintendo has a totally different way of implementing Bluetooth because Nintendo lives on a
[327.68 → 333.92] different planet where Bluetooth wireless in-ear headphones aren't a thing and no one would want
[333.92 → 338.96] to use that or whatever you know so oh Bluetooth doesn't work and Wi-Fi doesn't work, and you got to
[338.96 → 344.72] kind of chip away at these things little by little but one of the key one of the key tools
[344.72 → 355.20] in any hacker's toolkit is a proof of concept right having it working in some small way uh so that
[355.20 → 362.96] you can take that solution and then trace the path back to create a better solution so to be clear it's
[362.96 → 369.84] not like people can build a mining farm out of 30 60s right now in fact my understanding is you can only
[369.84 → 376.08] mine at full speed on it if you have it connected to an external display and if it is the only 30 60
[376.08 → 386.24] in the system, but this is still a major win because once you have it working a little yeah that that's
[386.24 → 391.76] a lot less uh of things that are limiting you from doing what you want to get out of the way you now have
[391.76 → 397.28] it mining you have very clear steps forward now you need to try to get rid of the monitor limitation
[397.28 → 403.04] and the only 30 60 limitation, and then you're you're going yes, and it also gives you because
[403.04 → 414.24] so basically what happened was uh NVIDIA um uh NVIDIA accidentally uh released a developer driver
[414.24 → 422.32] that did not have the mining limiter implemented version 470.05 it requires a developer account but
[422.32 → 428.48] anyone can be instantly verified for a developer account and allowed these cards to mine at 40 to 50
[428.48 → 438.80] mega hashes per second instead of 20 to 25. Um yeah so one of the other things part was already
[438.80 → 445.12] mentioned but this isn't actually like perfect for gamers before you get your hopes up because
[445.12 → 453.04] you're stuck on that driver um and game ready drivers are kind of a thing so big yikes so one of the other
[453.04 → 460.08] things that having a working version to compare to your blocked version does is it allows you to look at
[460.88 → 466.80] how the system behaves differently when it's working versus when it's blocked so you can try and reverse
[466.80 → 472.88] engineer how the block works and yeah one of the things that's like Luke said is a real bummer about
[472.88 → 478.88] this is that while this does prevent commercial miners from getting the most out of these 30 60s for
[478.88 → 487.04] now what it doesn't do is allow individual gamers to recoup some of the cost from their card by just
[487.04 → 492.88] mining on the side if they want to get the best performance and the best feature compatibility in the
[492.88 → 499.60] latest games like with a game ready driver um as a gamer probably would one of the other problems that
[499.60 → 507.44] this PR that this presents for gamers too is that if there's all the if the news keeps coming like this
[507.44 → 513.92] oh hey now it's working with a monitor attached, and now it's working with no monitor attached but you
[513.92 → 520.72] can just have one in the system oh now it's working this way miners will continue to grab these cards at
[520.72 → 528.08] every possible opportunity because a's already profitable anyway even with the nerf and b if
[528.08 → 533.44] there's hope that the profitability of it could go up well then they're obviously going to want to get
[533.44 → 542.16] them while they can because the price of these things is only going to go higher oh now the upcoming 3080
[542.16 → 548.72] ti or the rumoured upcoming 3080 ti is rumoured to have a similar mining performance nerf on release
[548.72 → 557.92] um but if the feature is implemented in the same way whatever workaround that now you know miners
[557.92 → 564.56] have access to uh one way, or now they can at least observe uh whatever workaround they build for this
[564.56 → 571.76] uh could potentially be used for new cards as well, so phoenix miner developers claim to be working on a
[571.76 → 576.72] kernel level update this is over a week ago so even if NVIDIA rolls back the drivers or makes it more
[576.72 → 581.68] difficult to gain access to developer tools others are still hard at work trying to remove the blocker
[581.68 → 588.64] and then one of the other key pillars of NVIDIA's um sort of segmentation of the market between gamers
[588.64 → 594.40] and miners is creating their mining only cards and my big objections here a lot of people misunderstood
[594.40 → 599.84] that video it was kind of shocking people were like what are you mad NVIDIA is trying to make money
[599.84 → 607.92] they're a company they're going to make money no I never said that I'm I run a company that tries to
[607.92 → 614.72] make money I mean i even made it very clear I thought in the video with my sort of cheeky segue to
[614.72 → 621.52] our sponsor that I got no problem because people got to eat i have to eat Luke's got to eat Luke you have to eat
[621.52 → 629.92] right yeah sometimes man's got to eat okay I got no problem with that the problem is presenting what
[629.92 → 638.96] is a blatant business move as some kind of magnanimous gift that you're giving to gamers it's not
[638.96 → 646.56] so don't pretend it is if NVIDIA had released mining cards and said yep we're releasing mining cards I'd
[646.56 → 651.68] have said okay we'd have talked about it on wan show or tech linked or whatever I wouldn't have
[651.68 → 656.24] made a whole video about it is might have been like a little disappointed due to silicon shortage
[656.24 → 660.56] and stuff like that but wouldn't have been nearly as big of a deal yeah I wouldn't have said NVIDIA
[660.56 → 665.68] doesn't care about gamers because NVIDIA wouldn't have pretended that the move was about caring
[665.68 → 672.56] gamers so I might have said uh you know I'm disappointed at the amount of unnecessary e-waste and
[672.56 → 677.44] to be clear a gaming card is e-waste too, but this is in the video it's its it's always obvious when
[677.44 → 681.36] someone comments, and they haven't actually watched the video this is in the video I'm not telling you
[681.36 → 686.32] guys don't buy a graphics card because it's e-waste I mean you know yeah sure that might be the
[686.32 → 692.72] environmentally responsible thing to do but what I'm saying is you know what that's bad enough already
[692.72 → 700.00] why don't we not make it worse on purpose so instead of manufacturing cards that have literally no
[700.00 → 706.88] purpose other than to suck up power and then go to a landfill um why don't we just put a display
[707.84 → 714.40] a display connection on it so that at least once it's done its life as a mining card it can go be
[714.40 → 719.44] a gaming card or vice versa for that matter I called on them in that video to just unlock the mining
[719.44 → 728.72] capabilities of it because the lock as I said and has come to pass didn't do anything uh miners are still
[728.72 → 734.72] buying all the cards, and they're figuring out how to work around it already anyway so why not just
[734.72 → 742.80] let retail gamers make mine a little bit of Ethereum on the side which is kind of my whole there that's
[742.80 → 749.12] kind of everything I have to say oh there's also the separate issue um that the CMP mining cards seem
[749.12 → 755.60] to be based on are they based on pascal or Turing I can't remember the point is they actually don't
[755.60 → 761.68] appear to be ampere anyway and the performance uh per watt seems to be like kind of terrible
[762.24 → 767.36] meaning that i I don't even yeah there's this sort of rumours that it's basically just they're
[767.36 → 776.16] they're like garbage, and so they had dye issues and stuff, and they're just like yeah ship it well no, no
[776.16 → 782.40] NVIDIA made that very clear that these did not meet their requirements for g4 there 's's been
[782.40 → 789.12] rumours that it's like worse than we thought you know got it um so you know what um fair enough
[789.12 → 796.80] I guess but then i I don't I just looking at the numbers I don't see why anyone would buy them
[796.80 → 804.56] they're extremely expensive uh they consume too much power for the hash rate um and honestly I would just
[804.56 → 810.56] rather that instead of creating artificially segmented products manufacturers just make the
[810.56 → 815.76] the best thing they can and then let it be as useful as it can like I've talked about these same things
[815.76 → 821.68] whether it's intel locking out ECC memory compatibility on their core chips or whether
[821.68 → 828.64] it's NVIDIA or AMD for that matter locking out um you know performance capabilities and professional
[828.64 → 836.48] applications on their non-squadron or non-fire uh cards like i it's something I find very frustrating in
[836.48 → 843.28] general um or whether it's tesla including rear heated seats and then you pay to you know allow
[843.28 → 849.28] the electrons to flow um i just I find it very frustrating even though I do understand the business
[849.28 → 855.76] cases around building features in that way now particularly something like squadron or fire I find
[855.76 → 862.48] it a little less offensive because there really is significant driver development work this is so
[862.48 → 867.68] essentially you're not buying hardware at that point you are buying software there is significant
[867.68 → 873.28] development work that goes into validating those products for these professional applications it's
[873.28 → 881.20] it's the for no apparent reason functionality locks um like you know canning the double precision
[881.20 → 888.64] uh floating point performance of a titan for example uh that is very that can be very
[888.64 → 895.68] frustrating um back to my point about retail gamers like individual gamers making back some of
[895.68 → 900.72] their money by mining uh there's been a bit of controversy around our nice hash sponsorship earlier
[900.72 → 906.96] this week and I just want to take a bit of time to address that um first there's the people that
[906.96 → 914.80] are upset that I appear to be flip-flopping on the issue of mining I don't believe I have ever flip-flopped in
[914.80 → 924.56] any way I mean we've always been kind of tepid on it, we are pro the technology i I believe in
[924.56 → 932.48] cryptocurrency for realties um I think that some form of blockchain currency could be the answer to a lot
[932.48 → 939.36] of our problems I don't think that bitcoin is necessarily it there are a lot of problems with a lot
[939.36 → 946.08] of the current cryptocurrency and for that matter blockchain technologies um but i I do fundamentally
[946.08 → 954.72] believe in the concept uh, so there's that I am not a huge fan of large-scale mining operations I don't
[954.72 → 962.64] think that was ever really what the creators had in mind was individuals filling entire warehouses
[962.64 → 968.80] with these ASIC miners that serve no purpose other than to you know tackle the ever-increasing
[968.80 → 977.36] difficulty of uh performing these calculations uh i I don't imagine that's what they imagined
[977.36 → 984.48] because the whole idea behind a decentralized currency is that you don't have these centralized
[984.48 → 991.68] sort of power brokers in the space i I thought the idea really was individuals with you know a GPU or
[991.68 → 997.04] their CPU or whatever you know crunching these numbers on the side and so that it was like truly very
[997.04 → 1001.28] decentralized, but you know maybe I'm wrong maybe that really was what they intended that was never
[1001.28 → 1007.28] the way I interpreted it so I've never really had an objection to individuals mining in fact we did a
[1007.28 → 1014.88] whole series about it in 2018 um I am bothered by it not being possible for individual gamers to get
[1014.88 → 1020.32] the hardware that they need to enjoy video games which I love and I think you guys love at a fair price
[1020.32 → 1026.96] that bothers me um opportunistic uh opportunistic money making yeah bothers me um
[1027.84 → 1034.48] to be clear I don't think it's the same as people who were um who were going in and scooping up all the
[1034.48 → 1041.28] toilet paper or hand sanitizer in the early days of the pandemic video game gaming hardware is not it's not
[1041.28 → 1049.36] an essential product in the same way that you know soap is um, but it definitely rubs me the wrong way when
[1049.36 → 1057.12] people post a picture on Instagram of 100 RTX 3080s, and they're selling them for three times the retail
[1057.12 → 1064.64] price um so with all that said, so some people were upset that I appeared to be flip-flopping on the
[1064.64 → 1070.72] issue of mining so that's my stance on it and I don't think that anything that I said in that video or
[1070.72 → 1077.52] before that video conflicts with that stance however uh there were also people that were really unhappy
[1077.52 → 1084.88] with nice hash's history so uh one of nice hash's founders has a spotty history that frankly I was
[1084.88 → 1092.32] not aware of um sometimes we catch red flags in companies uh before we work with them sometimes
[1092.32 → 1097.12] the community catches them, and we say okay you guys don't like this lets not do this anymore
[1097.12 → 1102.64] um thanks for bringing it to our attention, and it looks like that's where we're going with this one so
[1102.64 → 1108.56] you guys don't like if it's done um we did talk to nice hash about the issue there's a lot to be
[1108.56 → 1116.00] clear there's lots of people at nice hash who are not that founder so I'm not I'm not super into
[1116.56 → 1123.44] punishing one person for the actions of another which they have already been as far as I can tell
[1124.00 → 1130.24] actually punished for um but if it's something that you guys aren't comfortable with especially
[1130.24 → 1136.56] because this is software that runs in the background on your machine then 100 we get it we read you guys
[1136.56 → 1142.56] loud and clear it's done it's gone um I think that's pretty much all I have to say about that other
[1142.56 → 1147.12] than you know thank you for thanking you for bringing the issue to our attention I mean we've we've consulted
[1147.12 → 1153.44] with you guys before uh when we decided to keep working with Pia after their acquisition um that
[1153.44 → 1159.84] was something that we publicly talked to you guys about with VPNs that was it was an area where we
[1159.84 → 1167.68] knew you know the landscape was already covered in mines um whereas this was one where you know
[1167.68 → 1173.20] honestly we didn't think about it that much nicer hash it's like yep they've had some issues in the
[1173.20 → 1178.48] past that we were aware of like the hack where a bunch of people lost their coin they returned all
[1178.48 → 1182.64] the coin we thought that was pretty like good guy nice hash it's a lot better than faking your own
[1182.64 → 1191.36] death and pretending the coins never existed now you might laugh but uh that is a that is a thing
[1191.36 → 1196.72] that people strongly suspect happened was that ever confirmed I'm I'm self-laughing because that's
[1196.72 → 1204.64] where all my coin went oh, oh oops yeah all right well sorry about that um hardware wallets they showed up
[1204.64 → 1213.04] that week and I hadn't moved this stuff into it yet anyway um, so there's that uh so we anyway we
[1213.04 → 1218.56] thought we did they did a pretty good job of dealing with that it's software that i and Jake and Luke
[1218.56 → 1225.12] do you use nice hash or have you i I did way in the past it's been a long time, but it's software we've all
[1225.12 → 1232.64] used and been happy with so as far as you know our due diligence went we were like yeah it's a good
[1232.64 → 1238.64] program we like it um we have no problem with people mining on the side and making a couple bucks
[1238.64 → 1244.16] uh I've even got a comment from someone in flow plane chat here hold on I think I paused the chat
[1244.16 → 1249.20] earlier, but it seems like it um stopped being paused they're like yeah hey thanks for making
[1249.20 → 1257.20] that nice hash video I made 50 bucks so far it's like yep, so lots of people were sorry I said that's
[1257.20 → 1261.76] a lot to make in that time but I guess like if you're is you're a household too like if you have
[1262.96 → 1270.24] two or more gaming computers it can add up really quickly yeah so you know what there that that's
[1270.24 → 1277.12] pretty much it so yeah some people were upset um not unjustifiably, so some people weren't upset and
[1277.12 → 1282.72] we actually were like hey thanks for bringing this to my attention I had no idea it was this easy um
[1283.60 → 1289.28] so we're not taking the video down we're, but we're also just going to we're gonna sunset
[1289.92 → 1297.92] uh working with nice hash or for that matter just any cryptocurrency anything for a while here and
[1297.92 → 1302.48] we'll come back to you guys we'll talk to you guys if there's is there's a deal that looks like
[1302.48 → 1306.88] uh we think it makes sense, and we'll make sure that you guys agree before we do anything else like that i
[1306.88 → 1313.60] mean it's not the only category that we've just gone you know what this is to this is
[1313.60 → 1320.24] this is too controversial i just I don't want anything to do with it um we're you know what no
[1320.24 → 1323.44] I'm not going to name any other ones because I think it's going to make it too clear exactly
[1324.00 → 1329.28] you know who made a stink and you know what was problematic and who we cut off I don't want to get
[1329.28 → 1335.12] into that, but there are other categories that we just outright don't touch I mean one
[1335.12 → 1341.92] example that we've never touched oh what's that i just thought of one um gray market keys are
[1341.92 → 1347.68] one that we just avoid altogether um some people work with them, we don't judge them, but it's
[1347.68 → 1353.60] just something we've never been comfortable with um oh fair ann says I think one of the big issues on
[1353.60 → 1360.40] nice hash was the phoenix ordeal um yeah I don't know the full details of what happened between
[1360.40 → 1366.72] them it's honestly a little over my head uh more than two minutes of reading was all I was really
[1366.72 → 1371.36] willing to put into it because by that point i had already decided we're just this just isn't worth it
[1371.36 → 1376.64] we're not gonna we're not going to do this anymore so i kind of it's not that I don't care it's just that
[1376.64 → 1381.04] uh it didn't factor into my decision because it was already made so I haven't spent a bunch of time
[1381.04 → 1387.12] um I do think that spurred a lot of the community backlash there's been some definitely some
[1387.12 → 1394.08] emotions flying yep in that space but yeah uh 10sp says and what about not talking about the
[1394.08 → 1400.80] environmental impacts of crypto so again I don't think that the intent of cryptocurrency was for all
[1400.80 → 1406.48] of the bitcoin to get mined in such short order to have these you know the power of a country you know
[1406.48 → 1413.20] running this thing I don't think that was the point of it and if it was is it was actually being
[1413.20 → 1419.52] used the way it was supposed to be used i I don't think it would be as big of a problem and i specifically
[1419.52 → 1426.56] said I specifically said in the video that if you're using electric heat for your house this is a way that
[1426.56 → 1432.48] you can make money instead of spending money with your electric heating it's not that I support you know
[1432.48 → 1439.84] putting your mining rig in an air-conditioned room you know um i I don't think that's responsible I don't
[1439.84 → 1447.12] want people you know running out and wasting power either but i also again don't think that small scale
[1447.12 → 1456.32] mining from retail gamers is the fundamental problem here um let me just see if there's anyone else talking
[1456.32 → 1466.40] um all right yeahs can I segue you yeah yeah hit me what are we talking about now speaking of retail
[1468.40 → 1477.68] bridge wallet oh are we doing sponsors yeah let's do it uh but uh, uh oh crud uh is this the
[1477.68 → 1487.60] ridge wallet spot uh the dog the doc shows three different uh okay interesting rich.com
[1487.60 → 1493.84] slash wan yeah okay oh eighth anniversary wait ridge wallet's doing an eighth anniversary offer
[1493.84 → 1500.00] ridge wallet helps you carry less they use two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band
[1500.00 → 1504.96] to keep your cards tightly together but still easily accessible, and they're celebrating their eighth
[1504.96 → 1511.36] anniversary of their successful funding and the launch of ridge wallet.com by giving 15 at least
[1512.32 → 1518.48] 15 off site-wide at the link down below the ridge was launched on kickstarter by a father-son team
[1518.48 → 1522.56] Daniel and Paul Kane and since their launch they've sold they've sold over a million wallets
[1523.76 → 1530.16] damn Daniel that's a lot and Paul get it because that's their names it doesn't matter uh they
[1530.16 → 1534.80] offer lots of new materials dozens of colours uh they've got a nicer logo now they've come along
[1534.80 → 1539.36] way, and they're offering 15 off site-wide they've got a lot more than just wallets so go check them
[1539.36 → 1543.92] out they've got like battery banks and all kinds of cool stuff the show is also brought to you by
[1543.92 → 1550.16] remote HQ it's a work from home culture for most offices now and remote HQ is going to help you out
[1550.16 → 1554.72] with that because it can be a bit of a pain to collaborate with your team even if you do save the
[1554.72 → 1560.72] time commuting to and from the office it integrates apps such as chrome Google Drive YouTube and
[1560.72 → 1565.76] Microsoft Office into one meeting platform allowing members of your meeting to interact and make
[1565.76 → 1570.64] changes on the same screen with remote HQ you can seamlessly take control when you need to then give

[1575.36 → 1579.28] work together as though you're in the same room, and you don't have to take my word for it try it out
[1579.28 → 1585.84] for free for three months at remote hq.com wan show and just make sure that you use code when so you get
[1585.84 → 1591.68] that three months for free and speaking of controversial sponsors private internet access
[1591.68 → 1596.08] private internet access man the number of people that think we are sponsored by other VPNs and are
[1596.08 → 1602.88] like oh, oh Linus sponsorship from VPN that we've never actually worked with and the number of people
[1602.88 → 1614.08] that are upset about sort of misleading VPN marketing its crazy because with Pia a no we don't work with
[1614.08 → 1619.44] other VPNs we have in the past our total VPN history you know like when you meet
[1619.44 → 1629.92] someone, and you're like all right how many okay my VPN history is okay well we got hotspot shield
[1631.36 → 1637.04] is on the belt sorry got a few notches on the belt yeah not that many though not a huge amount
[1637.68 → 1641.76] I mean wasn't that it hotspot shield and tunnel bear that was the only ones I remember I think so
[1641.76 → 1648.64] yeah then Pia okay so Pia those are the only VPNs we've ever worked with and Pia is the only one
[1648.64 → 1654.24] we've been working with for years now and their marketing is literally only whatever we tell you
[1654.24 → 1661.04] guys that's it we don't tell you that Pia does anything it doesn't do, and we don't tell you it
[1661.84 → 1668.48] doesn't do anything it does okay the point is adding a VPN masks you rip and encrypts traffic to
[1668.48 → 1674.16] and from your devices that's if it's not a magic bullet to make it so that you are an invisible
[1674.16 → 1679.68] ghost on the internet or anything like that it's just one of the tools that should be part of any
[1679.68 → 1688.72] privacy uh privacy enthusiasts toolkit it has reliable service with no bandwidth caps so if you're a filthy
[1688.72 → 1695.76] pirate then uh Pia is not going to be like hey you used too much bandwidth this month doing whatever it
[1695.76 → 1700.40] is that you were doing they have configurable encryption and an internet kill switch to keep
[1700.40 → 1705.36] you in control of your connection and when combined with private browsing Pia can even make websites
[1705.36 → 1710.80] think you are in a different country they allow up to 10 devices at once with clients for windows mac
[1710.80 → 1716.64] OS android iOS and Linux and I would never advocate for family sharing with a plan Netflix gets real upset
[1716.64 → 1723.44] about family sharing I would never advocate for that but um Pia allows you to connect up to 10 devices at
[1723.44 → 1729.20] once with clients for windows macOS android iOS and Linux, and they recently launched a dedicate dip
[1729.20 → 1734.80] option that has absolutely zero connection to your account or to who you are not even Pia knows the IP
[1734.80 → 1739.68] address belongs to you while you have a smoother experience with the same privacy and security because
[1739.68 → 1743.84] when you're on a VPN sometimes like every site you go to is going to be like cloud flowers checking your
[1743.84 → 1748.80] thing for five seconds so if you just have one IP it means when you go back to that site the next time
[1748.80 → 1754.16] it's chill they already have over 24 000 servers in 77 countries, and you can try them risk-free with
[1754.16 → 1762.00] their 30-day money-back guarantee at leg.GG slash Pia when so no misleading marketing ladies and gentlemen
[1762.00 → 1769.84] and no we don't work with any other VPNs just pia please don't have any big controversies thank you
[1769.84 → 1776.48] very much that'd be great yeah if you guys could just stay chill and awesome, and we could just work with
[1776.48 → 1781.28] you forever then that'd be awesome because honestly I feel like if we had to go through the whole
[1781.84 → 1788.16] VPN breakup thing again I might just be like Luke I got some bad news you're making a VPN
[1790.48 → 1796.16] fullplanevpn.com only Canada yeah the only servers we have
[1798.80 → 1806.40] um, so someone is asking uh is it five or ten devices i someone else responded it was five
[1806.40 → 1812.08] it is now ten does that sound correct yeah yeah okay uh sometimes we probably still say five
[1812.08 → 1817.28] because some of our all the channels have different copy and some of them get updated more often than
[1817.28 → 1824.00] others so if you've heard conflicting information from us, it's its ten so you know these AJ just said
[1824.00 → 1829.12] nice I'm in no, no so we've looked into it enough to know that it's more complicated than
[1829.12 → 1838.08] it seems um and I don't I don't I honestly I'm so happy to just work with Pia and have them pay us
[1838.08 → 1844.32] for sponsorship and let them deal with that liability because I don't feel like you know going up against
[1844.32 → 1849.12] some government that wants me to hand over records or whatever I don't need that in my life i just
[1849.12 → 1854.88] yeah that doesn't sound great at all I just don't I don't want it
[1858.00 → 1860.56] all right do you want to talk about
[1862.88 → 1872.72] what which thing the thing I'm disappointed about yeah I can, I did I don't know I'm not yeah no it's
[1872.72 → 1878.64] fine I think it would be interesting yeah I'm not going to give too many details, but basically we had
[1878.64 → 1887.20] uh an opportunity to get a new headquarters for Linus media group um there's probably some people
[1887.20 → 1892.16] internally this will be the first they're hearing about the outcome because there were kinds of rumours
[1892.16 → 1897.76] swirling we had talked to some of the management about it but not everyone but leg critter warehouse
[1898.32 → 1905.12] float plane would have all been able to be consolidated because it was like an absolutely gorgeous and very large
[1905.84 → 1913.52] site, and unfortunately we ran into some issues with the I don't want to bore you guys with all the
[1913.52 → 1920.56] details but something the area needed uh city services brought into it in order to be developed
[1921.12 → 1926.40] and the existing developer that's doing like a nearby development would have to get all of their
[1926.40 → 1933.04] development costs reimbursed by latecomers before we would get anything, and it looks like
[1933.04 → 1944.48] um it looks like because of that it the numbers are just they're bad they're real bad um it was going
[1944.48 → 1952.24] to cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of double what the price of the land was to get the land in a
[1952.24 → 1957.04] state where it could actually be built on and would probably take anywhere from eight to ten years
[1957.04 → 1967.04] before we actually walk through the front door of our new headquarters so I am extremely
[1967.04 → 1977.68] disappointed I'm I'm gutted um and I am just going to have to uh keep searching we haven't managed to
[1977.68 → 1982.96] find I mean we were just we were so excited about this thing we went as far as having an accepted
[1982.96 → 1988.08] offer on the property, and it was during the due diligence period where we found all these
[1988.08 → 1994.08] challenges that were not apparent on the surface that um the whole thing fell apart and another
[1994.08 → 2000.80] thing that sucks is hey you know how you know I lost a bunch of money on my GameStop um investment
[2002.00 → 2008.72] let me tell you uh commercial real estate um due diligence costs a lot more than uh throwing money
[2008.72 → 2019.60] into game stones all right a lot more, so yeah let's go ahead and uh move on that's it that's my
[2019.60 → 2026.72] that's my sad story I was very excited and now I am now I'm back to the drawing board my mic was muted but
[2026.72 → 2034.24] um yeah I mean people could probably get actually a pretty good estimate of the cost there I mean maybe
[2034.24 → 2040.72] not that great but like they're they're substantial yeah tens of thousands basically, and it's down the
[2040.72 → 2047.60] drain like its due diligence that uh just to be you know good guys we're giving it to the seller to
[2047.60 → 2052.72] be like hey maybe this will save you some time with the next person who comes along um you guys can
[2052.72 → 2057.44] sort of try to reach a deal, and it won't take so long because we think they are under some
[2057.44 → 2062.40] pressure to sell some financial pressure so we're trying to like to help them out because we spent weeks
[2062.96 → 2071.20] on reports and analysis and consultants um throw it away it's used yeah it's better for them
[2071.20 → 2076.64] to have it than for us to literally just take all the documents and put it in the garbage you know
[2076.64 → 2082.48] well we paid for this so no one else should have it like I'm I'm not that's not my jam but I'm still
[2083.76 → 2085.12] I'm still not stoked on it
[2085.12 → 2094.16] um 11th gen core lineup unveiled as more reviews leak intel gets a little desperate in total there
[2094.16 → 2100.96] are 19 skews 30 including low-end comet lake refreshes, so these are just like rebranded 11th
[2100.96 → 2107.68] gen but actually last gen, and it's not looking that compelling um
[2107.68 → 2118.72] um there's a lot of overlap industry speculation is that the core i7 11 700k and kph will basically
[2118.72 → 2125.76] offer the same performance as the 11 900k because it appears that they are wait are these both
[2125.76 → 2134.24] eight cores now yeah man they have eight core so the i7 and the i9 are both eight core chips
[2135.12 → 2143.52] and it's just that the i9 boosts 300 megahertz higher but do they both have turbo velocity boost
[2143.52 → 2148.80] right, but you could probably manually no, no okay the i7 doesn't have turbo velocity boost
[2148.80 → 2153.76] but then my understanding is you can basically manually tune that for the most part anyway if
[2153.76 → 2159.52] you have the patience for it or no not quite no not quite it won't behave quite the same you can
[2159.52 → 2165.04] probably get slightly more performance out of TV if you have an adequate cooler which is where intel's
[2165.04 → 2173.28] like sub ambient um peatier effect coolers came in, and then they've got six cores uh 11 that's the i5
[2173.28 → 2180.32] range yeah that's basically all i's are six core processors that is a lot of wow that how many
[2180.32 → 2191.28] freaking that is 19 skews of just six and eight core i's to i's in a lot of places 50 or less dollar gaps
[2192.80 → 2197.76] yeah here actually here I can just throw display capture over here and Anthony uh threw this in
[2197.76 → 2203.04] here RC mail posted this on the forum by the way but yeah these are like but what
[2203.04 → 2208.40] like okay, so this is a low power one and this is a not low power one they're the same price
[2209.68 → 2219.04] this is a ten dollar difference for this one versus this one um, um okay for the other low power one
[2219.04 → 2226.24] you save 15 bucks or 25 dollars for an f which doesn't have onboard graphics so that's neat I guess
[2226.24 → 2236.40] okay, okay I was really hoping rocket lake was gonna really surprise me really going to take off
[2237.20 → 2241.44] hey well I mean just because a rocket takes off doesn't mean it can't still explode
[2242.32 → 2249.44] true SpaceX taught us this you can have a successful launch and still uh still have it go boom
[2249.44 → 2257.04] and that can actually still be a good thing oddly enough um but at the end of the day the early
[2257.04 → 2264.56] reviews which I personally think we can probably just you know treat as reviews uh you know if we
[2264.56 → 2269.52] were talking about engineering sample silicon early silicon sure fine, but these are retail chips like
[2269.52 → 2276.56] let's get real uh ridiculous thermals and disappointing performance seem to be the defining traits next to
[2276.56 → 2289.20] AMD yeah and speaking of weak marketing intel has just decided to make it personal with recently divorced
[2289.20 → 2294.16] apple that is awesome the fact that they hired Justin long to talk about how pcs are better i actually
[2294.16 → 2299.84] I actually like this move i I think it's hilarious I think it's cheeky I think it's about time
[2299.84 → 2309.84] intel had some attitude uh instead of just like being corporate and boring um so Justin long used to
[2309.84 → 2315.92] be the mac from the I'm a mac commercial for those of you who don't know and intel did some ads with him
[2315.92 → 2320.48] that point out things like that pcs come in all shapes and sizes they've got touch screens they've got
[2320.48 → 2327.44] support for external devices all that kind of stuff um with that said I haven't actually watched the
[2327.44 → 2337.28] spots yet so hopefully they're not really bad can I just you know what um Luke uh okay well hello i just
[2337.28 → 2345.04] watched one um there's five I watched having choices it's uh it's pretty all right it's pretty good okay
[2345.76 → 2346.72] let me have a look here
[2350.48 → 2356.40] oh that's just in it's in the notes okay he uses a touch screen it's on some Asus machine
[2357.20 → 2363.60] another touch screen oh okay it's Asus's cool one with the two touch screens got a little touch bar
[2370.40 → 2373.52] okay you know what they're not bad they're actually not bad I think they're fine
[2374.64 → 2380.40] yeah I'm I'm down I'm down I'm into it, I think they're funny um I mean realistically rocket
[2380.40 → 2385.76] lake is going to be successful enough for intel just because AMD can't make enough chips but
[2392.48 → 2393.20] which one is it
[2396.64 → 2399.36] Justin gets real having choices 16 seconds
[2399.36 → 2416.24] oh wait what why wouldn't they just have the laptop actually there I guess doing a screen
[2416.24 → 2424.40] replace will actually give you a cleaner look sometimes um so oh wait shoot uh there we go uh
[2424.40 → 2428.88] sorry about that yeah Luke said we need to go to 16 seconds and look at his hands
[2428.88 → 2434.08] um so yeah I know why they would have done this sometimes glare when you're shooting can be very
[2434.08 → 2440.96] problematic so just replacing the screen in post can give you a better result but I mean it's not
[2440.96 → 2442.40] that's not great um
[2442.40 → 2452.40] it's not a good look when you look like your kind of have to motion track your thing let's see
[2452.40 → 2460.88] over here yeah yeah that's that's really not great okay all right uh do you think they should have
[2460.88 → 2466.56] stuck with the original format no just had like two people talking no I think this is really personable
[2466.56 → 2471.68] I think this is what they were trying to communicate I'm Justin I'm a normal guy and having choice is good
[2472.64 → 2478.56] with that said intel's going to have to do a lot more than that to combat Apple Silicon I mean we've only seen
[2478.56 → 2486.00] literally the baby Apple Silicon this basically an iPad processor on roads like that's all we've seen so far
[2486.00 → 2491.20] and I don't I don't have the way mac people were mad at me for describing it that way still makes no sense to me
[2491.20 → 2497.84] that's what it is that's what it was always it's an iPad chip on right I'm not saying the iPad is bad
[2497.84 → 2503.68] I never said that iPad's amazing we've made a lot of videos lately about how the iPad has become
[2503.68 → 2511.92] a computer um so but anyway what I'm trying to say is we've only seen little Kitty baby Apple Silicon
[2512.88 → 2521.04] they still have liked you know big Apple Silicon coming and if it's anywhere near as good
[2521.04 → 2526.32] as you know baby Apple Silicon then intel has quite the fight on their hands
[2529.44 → 2534.00] all right what else we got Luke why don't you do a topic I feel like I've been talking the whole time
[2534.00 → 2541.84] sorry um AMD launches the Rx 6700 XT the Radeon RX 6700 XT launched on Thursday
[2542.16 → 2550.16] with something less boring okay oof it launched the 6700 XT it was not as good as we hoped there
[2551.04 → 2557.44] i it was fine yeah I'm kind of surprised you hoped for more
[2560.16 → 2565.12] um well I don't really think they alluded to being able to promise for more to be completely honest
[2566.56 → 2573.28] but anyway we can move on Google slashes play store fees with a twist and this is actually
[2573.28 → 2578.08] kind of interesting we've been talking about this for a while mostly on the apple side of things um but
[2578.08 → 2582.96] this is some interesting kind of steps in the right direction google has announced
[2582.96 → 2590.16] that starting July 1st 2021 the service fee google play receives is being reduced by half from 30 to
[2590.16 → 2597.52] 15 15 15 is much closer to inline with a lot of other competing services for the first 1 million us
[2597.52 → 2606.00] dollars of revenue for every developer now this is still terrifying to be completely clear yeah because
[2606.00 → 2613.84] if your app takes off at some point, and you do have high overhead losing 15 percent um I was going
[2613.84 → 2619.36] to say randomly but not randomly right when you cross that line losing 15 could be horrifying, but it's
[2619.36 → 2624.24] definitely a step in the right direction uh this comes on the heels of a similar cut by apple spurred by
[2624.24 → 2628.96] the ongoing epic games legal saga google says we believe this is a fair approach that aligns with
[2628.96 → 2634.16] google's broader mission to help all developers succeed yeah very cool you're just going to have to
[2634.16 → 2640.56] make sure that as a developer you are ready to stomach that 15 loss once you get there uh so
[2640.56 → 2645.76] you have to be paid you have to pay a lot of attention to your income through the play store
[2645.76 → 2652.48] and what that's going to mean for you moving forward um and I'm sure it will be communicated quite
[2652.48 → 2659.60] openly um but I hope that not just people that read like the verge are going to know about this um I'm
[2659.60 → 2664.24] sure they will but yeah uh the most notable difference between google and apple's approach
[2664.24 → 2669.84] is that google is giving 15 to every developer every year for the first million dollars that's
[2669.84 → 2676.56] also a very interesting thing um because I have been talking about how it is a big hit, but it's not
[2676.56 → 2682.00] a big hit that's going to be just like immediately crush your company the second you get over that dollar
[2682.00 → 2687.60] value that's a really cool big difference it's kind of like how income tax works where your first no
[2687.60 → 2693.04] matter who you are your first 20 000 is at a very, very low tax rate, and then it scales up from there
[2693.04 → 2699.84] but it doesn't increase your taxes on the first astronomically more sense to me because we
[2699.84 → 2704.72] we talked about the apple approach and i I pushed forward a lot of what I just said of like you need to
[2704.72 → 2711.68] be wary of this whatever but with the Google one you need to be wary of it but if you push the line
[2712.40 → 2717.52] the doors of your store don't immediately close if you can't stomach that percentage yeah because
[2717.52 → 2723.60] you're still making that percentage on the first million and if you make 50 grand over the million
[2723.60 → 2731.68] you're only paying an additional 50 on that yeah 50 I might have just said 50. yeah, 15. Um which it
[2731.68 → 2737.12] that's just that yeah makes way more sense to me, I think it's very cool google notes that about 3
[2737.12 → 2741.76] percent of android developers actually charge for either downloading their apps or for digital in-app
[2741.76 → 2746.80] purchases to begin with and only one percent of those developers make more than a million uh on that
[2746.80 → 2753.28] that that that is true there are also a lot of developers on the app store which are like
[2754.00 → 2759.20] would have been me in high school if I was in high school right now just like posting random stuff um
[2759.20 → 2765.20] so those numbers are definitely inflated a bit, but it is I mean there isn't all that many companies
[2765.20 → 2769.28] that are going to run a million dollars of revenue through one of the various ways to acquire their
[2769.28 → 2776.64] product so yeah I mean it's its it's very true i just I think this is very cool I mean I would
[2776.64 → 2784.16] prefer if it was just 15 percent always but the way I'm doing it sorry you're a little biased oh for
[2784.16 → 2790.88] sure yes disclosure Luke works for a company that develops an app for yeah yeah yeah so like maybe
[2790.88 → 2796.88] my opinion on this doesn't matter as much um but I will absolutely give them credit for the way that
[2796.88 → 2802.80] they're doing it on just the first one million thing makes a ton of sense um I could even see
[2802.80 → 2806.72] if they did a different thing I don't know what number it would have to be maybe it was five
[2806.72 → 2811.04] million or something but like once you cross that threshold they're just like all right buddy
[2812.32 → 2818.56] screw it you're you're paying 30 on the whole thing something like that I'd even accept that but
[2818.56 → 2825.04] just at the very least making it so that that first transition is smooth is huge I was going to say if
[2825.04 → 2830.56] anything I think once you're at like five million or whatever you should be treated like a valued partner
[2830.56 → 2836.56] and your rate should be lowed I don't think it should be 30 percent yeah that's probably so much
[2836.56 → 2841.92] business traditional business works yeah so that makes sense yeah good point it's its it's the
[2841.92 → 2848.08] it's the middle it's always the middle class that pays for everyone else because you have to subsidize
[2848.08 → 2855.92] the small fish and the big fish well they throw their weight around, and so i I don't necessarily
[2855.92 → 2861.60] there are a lot of problems with that system absolutely but if anything I would think on
[2861.60 → 2867.84] something like the app store it would make more sense i i I don't fundamentally disagree with epic
[2867.84 → 2875.68] game's stance that 30 of their revenue on like a billion dollars or whatever is sort of unreasonable
[2875.68 → 2884.16] for what is essentially a file hosting service um and yes I'm I'm simplifying I'm definitely simplifying
[2884.16 → 2891.04] but I also think that we only have to look as far as apple and Google's quarterly disclosures to
[2891.04 → 2897.68] know that they are immensely profitable in these areas the play store and the app store and they
[2897.68 → 2903.60] could stand to share a little more i just think it is so cool that they made that transition smooth
[2903.60 → 2911.60] yeah because it is like it just I mean the fear that a company would have approached that one million dollar mark
[2912.16 → 2919.44] like you'd think as a company you'd be so stoked like okay we just we pushed our revenues on this platform to a million dollars
[2919.44 → 2931.60] we should have like a company party or something, but instead they're just like oh god we're going to lose so much money and that's I mean there's social support programs that are like that too I remember talking to my sister about one she was telling me about it and I was just like what
[2931.60 → 2942.08] what so the way it works is basically any money that you make goes comes straight out of the support check
[2942.08 → 2948.96] and I was like why and I was she's like I don't know but not yeah people that I know they're just like why
[2948.96 → 2954.80] would I bother to work I get paid literally zero dollars for like doing casual work to try and improve my standard of living
[2954.80 → 2961.68] and just because I'm doing some casual work doesn't mean that I don't still need support that I'm not still disabled
[2962.24 → 2967.92] it just means that you know I'm basically what it does is it discourages people from transitioning back
[2967.92 → 2972.72] into the workplace yeah I hate systems like that because not only does it discourage people from
[2972.72 → 2980.32] transitioning back into the workplace but it also directly heavily encourages um like illegal practices
[2980.32 → 2985.44] because what's what's the first thing you'd probably want to do not declare my income yeah exactly
[2986.80 → 2991.60] so then as a taxpayer I'm sitting here going wait so we are incentivizing these people
[2991.60 → 2998.32] to hide their what little income they have out of fear that we're so that they won't pay any taxes out
[2998.32 → 3003.52] of fear that they're sorry what are we trying to accomplish here yeah like that's just that you're
[3003.52 → 3009.36] putting a bunch of uh tape and bureaucracy on something that that just needlessly complicates it and makes
[3009.36 → 3014.96] a bunch of bull crap happen it doesn't actually solve any actual problems it's just so mojo says
[3014.96 → 3018.96] here about developers of different sizes the solution is to not let the big fish throw their weight
[3018.96 → 3027.20] around the thing is though for app developers even the biggest fish are you know they're tuna okay
[3027.20 → 3034.00] they're getting eaten they're getting eaten by the real apex predators which are of course apple google
[3034.00 → 3043.60] uh Microsoft etc megalodons I think the mega mega mega megalodons uh there was one other topic that
[3043.60 → 3049.84] I wanted to hit here ah yes uh sx8200 pro bounty update if you sent us info about your drive from last
[3049.84 → 3054.56] week thank you in total we received hundreds of emails and found all the variants we originally
[3054.56 → 3061.60] asked for and at least three more new ones so I just spent thousands of dollars on uh potentially
[3061.60 → 3066.48] crappy SSDs thanks they all uh we can't respond to everyone due to the volume of emails, but we'll
[3066.48 → 3070.80] reach out to you if your drive is selected as one that we need, we do not need more selections thank you
[3070.80 → 3077.04] very much everyone and AMD refuses to limit cryptocurrency mining performance they basically said nope we will
[3077.04 → 3082.80] not be blocking any workload uh not mining not anything else um we're going to keep optimizing for
[3082.80 → 3089.20] gaming and designing our cards for gaming uh, but we're not going to like to hamper their mining performance
[3089.20 → 3094.16] and I agree with their stance that's the same thing I said about NVIDIA's announcement for the 3060
[3094.16 → 3102.48] I think it doesn't solve anything, and it's just it's just harming end users for no apparent reason isn't
[3102.48 → 3109.84] it isn't it great when doing absolutely nothing makes you the good guy I know right isn't that
[3109.84 → 3116.64] awesome thank you yeah you have to cherish those moments yeah it's like just sitting and watching
[3116.64 → 3127.52] your opponent self-immolate this is fine this is cool yeah uh oh I have an update uh speaking of doing
[3127.52 → 3132.64] absolutely nothing we have been doing lots to get the verified actual gamer program running man do you
[3132.64 → 3137.28] guys have any idea how much this is killing me i already paid for this hardware it's its
[3137.28 → 3143.28] sitting in the warehouse it's like it's ready to go, but we ran into some challenges there was a bit of
[3143.28 → 3149.20] a communication snafu something tariff something draft orders something
[3149.20 → 3156.08] the system we spend a bunch of time building doesn't work so uh Yuri bless him the rest of the float
[3156.08 → 3162.88] plane team Luke you too um have been working like crazy to get it working because the last thing we want
[3162.88 → 3171.04] to do is have even a single card go into the hands of someone who is not a verified actual gamer we'd
[3171.04 → 3177.36] rather be late than to do it wrong so we're gonna i I should never have said we were going to launch it
[3177.36 → 3182.40] last week um I shouldn't have said we're going to launch it this week I'm just not going to say anything
[3182.40 → 3188.72] it will go live when it goes live and if you guys are watching the videos and paying close attention and if
[3188.72 → 3194.00] you are in an actual gamer, and you can verify it then you will have a chance to get one of these
[3194.00 → 3202.64] cards again the partners we're working with so far are Asus MSI and AMD they have all been extremely
[3202.64 → 3208.00] generous and very supportive of the program um, and they were just like yeah this is a really cool
[3208.00 → 3213.04] concept and you guys will get all the details when that video drops which will hopefully be sooner
[3213.04 → 3218.72] rather than later someone so a bunch of people in the chat said why don't you just not sell them
[3218.72 → 3227.36] to Americans that would have made this wildly more simple but is also kind of against the whole
[3228.56 → 3234.88] idea of it yeah so we're we're going to get it done it's going to be okay we'll get her done yes the
[3234.88 → 3240.24] tariffs were one of the most complicated the tariffs were one of the most complicated things because
[3240.24 → 3246.72] a there's getting the mechanisms working correctly and b there's getting the communication right
[3246.72 → 3253.44] um I don't want to call Americans spoiled but I will say that from my experience dealing with Americans
[3253.44 → 3260.32] they have a lot less experience dealing with things like import duties they just sort of fundamentally
[3260.32 → 3267.20] don't really understand why hardware is more expensive in Brazil say for example, or you know why the
[3267.20 → 3273.92] price tag goes up at the till um in Canada we're a lot more used to dealing with it because we live
[3273.92 → 3280.80] in a very Afrocentric kind of culture, but we're not American we're sort of third-party observers so for
[3280.80 → 3287.36] example when a new product launches unless it's a really major brand like apple it is very normal for
[3287.36 → 3293.92] it to have a price in U.S. dollars and then a price in Canadian dollars and that price in us dollars is fixed
[3293.92 → 3299.20] and then to have a price in Canadian dollars that actually just floats based on the U.S. to Canadian
[3299.20 → 3306.16] exchange rate so we're used to we've seen it before a graphics card that goes up 10 in price
[3306.16 → 3313.28] because the Canadian dollar plummets in 2008 for example so it's just sort of a fact of life or bananas
[3313.28 → 3318.96] you know the price of bananas will just fluctuate wildly week to week whereas I think a lot of Americans enjoy
[3318.96 → 3327.60] being in such a large market that they are sort of the well it's the USD right like they are the
[3327.60 → 3334.56] price or the sort of uh go-to-market strategy against which everyone else is sort of pegged and floats
[3334.56 → 3342.16] around so I enjoy it you guys um, but it would also mean that sometimes things happen like your
[3342.16 → 3348.32] administration puts tariffs on products from another country say for example china and when
[3348.32 → 3355.68] that happens there is no point taking it out on manufacturers or retailers it is what it is, and it's
[3355.68 → 3362.24] not as simple as building graphics cards in America sorry like the entire supply chain you know even
[3362.24 → 3367.36] just getting the capacitors that would go on the boards would have to be retooled this is a is
[3367.36 → 3372.96] a half a decade operation not something that can just be you know turned on when someone slaps an
[3372.96 → 3379.76] input import tariff on something so you know i we the last thing we wanted to do was not communicate
[3379.76 → 3385.76] it properly if this was a European for example they're already used to having something show up
[3385.76 → 3392.56] with like you know forty dollars in vat on it uh so that's their value add tax whereas like I said our
[3392.56 → 3397.68] experience working with Americans is that they're just not accustomed to import duties on things
[3397.68 → 3401.44] because well why isn't it shipped from America everything ships from America yes yeah I mean most
[3401.44 → 3410.48] things do but some things don't so that's where we're at um so we just want to make sure that it
[3410.48 → 3417.20] works properly and everything is communicated properly people like make it can it Canada only that
[3417.20 → 3422.40] would have oh man that would have made it so much easier that's another thing too is that we
[3422.40 → 3426.96] we've our experience dealing with American consumers is that part of not really understanding
[3427.84 → 3433.28] why this experience is different from everything they've experienced before is being angry about it
[3433.28 → 3440.40] and we're not looking to make our community angry we are looking to put cards in the hands of gamers
[3440.40 → 3446.24] that's that's the whole goal there is let me tell you guys there is not enough money in this for me
[3446.24 → 3453.52] for it to be worth making our community angry over at all if this is not net helpful and people aren't
[3453.52 → 3459.76] into it, I don't even care i I will send I will send the remaining products back to the distributors and
[3459.76 → 3467.84] we just we will discontinue the program so if you don't get one, and you're mad keep your mouth shut
[3467.84 → 3472.96] because you are going if you complain you're going to ruin it for someone who might have gotten one of the
[3472.96 → 3479.20] next ones could be you we are doing our absolute best no there are not enough cards no there are
[3479.20 → 3485.44] not enough CPUs not everyone will get one but what we are doing is we are making sure that whoever
[3485.44 → 3494.24] does get one is a verified actual gamer that's it and it to add a little asterisk on that yeah we can't
[3494.24 → 3500.16] necessarily guarantee that they're not going to flip it no we can't, but we can guarantee that they'll be a gamer
[3501.12 → 3507.20] so for better or for worse they're one of our own who turned to the dark side yeah we can't guarantee
[3507.20 → 3511.44] that they're not going to flip it we can't guarantee that they're not going to just let it sit in mine
[3511.44 → 3518.64] all the time, but we're doing our darnedest to make sure that they got to be one of us as much
[3518.64 → 3523.92] as possible trick says I love how some of us Americans get triggered when we don't get what we want and
[3523.92 → 3536.40] someone explains why i yeah all right anyway uh let's go ahead and go through some super chats
[3536.40 → 3542.00] it's been it's been a good chat I don't know it's always tough because I'm like I'm not I'm not saying
[3542.00 → 3547.68] that um like it's not it's not a bad thing it's not like Americans are bad or mean or whatever they
[3547.68 → 3553.28] it's just not something they're used to I've just spent my whole life knowing that prices for things go up
[3553.28 → 3559.68] and down and I might pay an extra arbitrary 50 bucks of import duties on an order of something
[3559.68 → 3564.08] that I want because it probably ships from the states like it's just it's a fact of my life that
[3564.08 → 3569.44] I'm just used to I've gone through all the stages of grief already whereas you guys are you guys are
[3569.44 → 3574.00] just getting started you know what I'm saying you got to start with some denial get some anger up in
[3574.00 → 3578.72] there something that constantly blows my mind while you're looking up a super chat here yeah
[3578.72 → 3586.48] is uh just because if you look at like a population chart of Canada yeah we basically all live on the
[3586.48 → 3592.88] border oh yeah yeah we basically all border the US and that's obviously not true for Americans um
[3594.24 → 3600.16] so this totally makes sense, but it also blows my mind because essentially every Canadian you talk to
[3600.16 → 3607.52] has a passport currently valid passport yes I know very, very few people that don't have a currently valid
[3607.52 → 3614.08] passport um I think the majority of Americans that I know don't have a currently valid passport yeah
[3614.08 → 3622.40] and every single time it comes up I'm just like why not what yeah we invited someone to Ltd one of the
[3622.40 → 3629.28] years, and they were like um oh man I don't know I'm going to have to like to get a passport and I was like
[3629.28 → 3635.04] excuse me what the yeah wait what I was like oh you just need to get it renewed, and they're like no
[3635.04 → 3643.92] I need to get a passport and I was like you're you're a grown man like yeah why don't you have a
[3643.92 → 3652.00] passport what so it's just there are some little cultural differences and the answer was as simple
[3652.00 → 3661.92] as well why would I ever have needed to leave America and I'm like oh I don't know I guess
[3665.04 → 3672.00] uh, uh Winnie says uh finally got to watch you live greetings from Romania scrapyard wars leg versus
[3672.00 → 3677.44] DI by perks when I mean not anytime soon but with travel restrictions and all that but I would be
[3677.44 → 3684.00] totally, totally down you guys got to do something with him at some point we got really close
[3684.88 → 3691.04] years back but I'd love to see a perk a DIY perks collab he's super cool
[3691.04 → 3695.44] um timothy says you guys should buy the whole building you're in and lease out the parts you
[3695.44 → 3702.80] don't use okay cool idea good idea solid investment advice investing in commercial real estate is an a
[3702.80 → 3708.48] plus a plus game plan especially here in the lower mainland where there is not nearly enough industrial
[3708.48 → 3715.52] land um sort of to throw a little bit of water on that fire that you got burning over there uh right
[3715.52 → 3724.80] now it's about a half a million dollars per thousand square feet okay so um you know that's real expensive
[3724.80 → 3731.20] that's real costly um real it's a real pricey um actually it's probably closer to a dollar
[3731.76 → 3745.50] or 350 dollars a square foot to buy right now industrial uh, uh space uh so yeah sure you know like if I wanted to spend millions of dollars to get them back slow to get them back slow to get them back slow to get them back and slow to get them back to the
[3745.52 → 3763.52] and then you guys could have water bottles and mouse pads on lttstore.com so it's all about allocating your funds correctly and for me investing in real estate is something that I do I mean I don't know if I've ever talked about this, but we own the own the units that we occupy right now so that's uh five units of the building that we're in each is about two thousand square feet plate um
[3763.52 → 3793.52] um, and we've built some mezzanine above it and stuff like that so I'm definitely down when it comes to investing in commercial real estate, but it's also you know if Linus media group made a million dollars let's say it would be far more wise for me to take that million dollars and hire more engineers or a social media coordinator or a community coordinator or an
[3793.52 → 3797.02] better equipment for the shop, make better content for you guys,
[3797.48 → 3801.84] invest it back in the business rather than investing it in a box
[3801.84 → 3803.78] that I then lease out to somebody.
[3804.08 → 3806.86] Because that's not the business I'm in, leasing property.
[3806.98 → 3809.26] I'm in the business of making content.
[3812.38 → 3814.74] Frosty, Linus, you inspire me daily. Keep being you.
[3814.82 → 3816.58] Hey, thanks, Frosty. You keep being you.
[3819.06 → 3823.24] Ilya says, hey, Linus, I hope you'll put your vacation to good use.
[3823.24 → 3826.04] You've become unprecedentedly annoying for the last month or so.
[3826.78 → 3829.00] Unprecedentedly annoying? No, no, no, no. Let me tell you.
[3829.38 → 3831.70] I have been very annoying in my life. Luke? Luke?
[3832.12 → 3833.88] Did he give you money to say you're annoying?
[3834.16 → 3836.52] Yeah, 100 rubles. I don't know how much money that is.
[3836.86 → 3837.80] You need to be more annoying.
[3838.18 → 3841.80] I guess so. Oh, okay. I mean, I think I can do that.
[3841.86 → 3842.94] Hold on. Let me work on this.
[3843.40 → 3846.24] All right. I'm going to go ahead and...
[3846.24 → 3847.16] Oh, no!
[3849.74 → 3851.18] Scott Briggs says...
[3851.18 → 3852.82] Love the channel. Keep up the good work.
[3852.82 → 3854.60] Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[3854.68 → 3855.62] I think we can make this more annoying.
[3855.62 → 3856.06] I think we can make this more annoying.
[3856.06 → 3856.42] Make this more annoying.
[3858.00 → 3859.28] William Hendricks says...
[3859.28 → 3866.24] Is that annoying enough? Are we good?
[3866.90 → 3867.70] Oh, my goodness.
[3868.70 → 3869.80] Cyrus Zero says...
[3869.80 → 3870.92] Wouldn't tell you your business.
[3871.04 → 3873.96] If it saves the opportunity, if utility issues...
[3873.96 → 3875.74] Could monetize vids on DIY...
[3875.74 → 3876.94] Oh, yeah. The...
[3876.94 → 3878.72] Oh, man. The DIY...
[3878.72 → 3879.78] Uh...
[3879.78 → 3881.92] Septic incinerator, etc., etc., etc.
[3881.92 → 3882.60] Yeah. Heck, yeah.
[3882.64 → 3890.92] We were super down to do, like, a really cool, like, self-sufficient, eco, like, green build-out.
[3890.92 → 3893.44] That was not in the vision.
[3893.44 → 3895.52] We would not have gotten a development permit for it.
[3895.58 → 3898.18] So that's ultimately one of the things that canned the deal.
[3898.72 → 3899.62] A perfect idea.
[3899.90 → 3901.02] Definitely share your vision.
[3901.16 → 3902.12] We just couldn't make it work.
[3905.64 → 3906.58] Jacob asks...
[3906.58 → 3909.46] Any plans to include some sort of code compilation benchmark in your toolkit?
[3909.58 → 3911.36] Yeah, that's something that we should probably do.
[3912.02 → 3913.90] I'll fire that over to Anthony right now.
[3914.44 → 3915.32] Let's make sure.
[3916.14 → 3920.34] Code compilation in upcoming CPU reviews.
[3920.86 → 3922.54] Don't we do a Firefox compile?
[3923.04 → 3924.00] Actually, I think we do.
[3924.66 → 3925.72] Never mind. I'm not going to send him that.
[3925.78 → 3927.06] I'm pretty sure we actually do that already.
[3927.40 → 3928.14] Oh, see you later.
[3928.78 → 3931.12] Flow plane Chat has been asking about two different things.
[3931.26 → 3933.08] One of them I'm sure there isn't an answer on,
[3933.12 → 3935.60] and the other one I'm 99% sure there isn't an answer on.
[3935.60 → 3937.08] Dell update?
[3938.06 → 3938.82] Dell update.
[3938.96 → 3939.82] I have not heard anything.
[3940.26 → 3942.62] So I can't force it, unfortunately.
[3942.62 → 3944.34] That one was the one that I was totally sure.
[3944.84 → 3948.16] The other one is shoe dryer.
[3949.18 → 3949.72] Shoe dryer.
[3949.92 → 3950.78] Yes, progress.
[3951.46 → 3951.60] Oh.
[3952.16 → 3952.72] Yeah, yeah.
[3952.94 → 3954.02] Kyle's working on it.
[3954.34 → 3955.70] These kinds of things take time.
[3955.76 → 3958.76] Anything with moulding, anything with electronics design,
[3958.86 → 3960.32] we want it to be extremely safe.
[3960.72 → 3964.58] The idea now is that it would also serve as a battery bank.
[3965.60 → 3968.06] And what else did we kind of...
[3968.78 → 3971.06] So I forget what exactly...
[3972.04 → 3973.92] I forget where exactly we're at on it,
[3973.98 → 3976.42] but it is absolutely still being developed.
[3976.68 → 3976.92] Yes.
[3977.38 → 3979.48] And it is still something that I need,
[3979.56 → 3983.02] because it would be great for more than just sports shoes.
[3983.02 → 3985.36] Even just throwing it in, like, your hockey bag,
[3985.56 → 3987.08] just having a little bit of air circulation.
[3987.08 → 3990.20] We've already done the pre-validation of the concept,
[3990.40 → 3992.96] and it's way better.
[3993.52 → 3994.14] Way better.
[3994.54 → 3995.98] Even in a closed bag,
[3996.24 → 3999.42] just having the air moving around is infinitely better.
[3999.42 → 4000.16] Yeah.
[4000.16 → 4002.12] So it's definitely...
[4002.12 → 4003.20] Even as a tiny fan,
[4003.34 → 4005.74] it makes, like, a many, many, many hour differences
[4005.74 → 4006.84] to how quickly it dries out.
[4007.10 → 4008.50] So we will do it.
[4008.58 → 4009.56] It's just a matter of time.
[4013.40 → 4013.80] Yeah.
[4014.38 → 4017.52] If you're searching for a Super Chat while you're searching,
[4017.66 → 4020.10] they're also asking for an update on mouse pads, desk pads.
[4020.34 → 4021.94] Desk pads will come when they come,
[4022.02 → 4022.96] and it should be soon.
[4023.12 → 4025.34] But kind of like verified actual gamer program.
[4025.76 → 4027.14] Theoretically, I'll tell you guys this,
[4027.22 → 4028.12] mouse pads are, like,
[4028.92 → 4030.86] the time away that they are
[4030.86 → 4032.32] should be measured in weeks, not months.
[4032.60 → 4035.38] But we've run into so many production and shipping delays
[4035.38 → 4037.06] that I just don't want to...
[4037.06 → 4038.08] I don't want to say anything
[4038.08 → 4039.22] until they're in the warehouse,
[4039.66 → 4042.26] and Patrick and the crew are ready to, like,
[4042.54 → 4043.14] ready to go,
[4043.62 → 4045.08] ready to just do it, ship them out.
[4045.50 → 4047.00] I just don't want to say anything,
[4047.22 → 4047.92] because what's the point?
[4048.74 → 4048.96] Yeah.
[4049.76 → 4050.46] Lenny says,
[4050.60 → 4052.14] European here, excuse my terrible English,
[4052.22 → 4052.60] I'm German.
[4052.60 → 4053.84] Your English is great.
[4053.96 → 4055.12] Great punctuation and everything.
[4055.32 → 4055.90] Love your content,
[4056.06 → 4057.38] and your beard looks really nice.
[4057.54 → 4058.38] Hey, thanks.
[4059.42 → 4060.74] Oh, you have an invader.
[4063.56 → 4064.30] Vinay says,
[4064.36 → 4066.00] Linus, please take care on your vacation.
[4066.22 → 4067.86] Your skin's starting to look unhealthy recently.
[4068.02 → 4069.18] Oh, that's probably because I was up
[4069.18 → 4071.06] till, like, 4.30 in the morning playing Anna.
[4071.52 → 4074.32] So the unhealthy skin is because of vacation.
[4075.20 → 4078.58] Not going to be fixed by vacation.
[4080.30 → 4081.12] Dev snack says,
[4081.12 → 4082.40] I'm a bit behind in the stream,
[4082.52 → 4084.28] but in reply to the intent of crypto
[4084.28 → 4085.50] and its environmental impact,
[4085.58 → 4087.08] I think it's worth talking about the reality
[4087.08 → 4087.96] instead of the ideals.
[4088.08 → 4088.62] Yeah, that's fair.
[4089.66 → 4090.56] That's really fair.
[4090.70 → 4091.38] And in reality,
[4091.52 → 4094.70] I'm super against large-scale crypto farms.
[4094.70 → 4096.66] I think it's not helpful.
[4096.66 → 4098.16] And in reality,
[4098.16 → 4101.50] I'm still okay with small-scale individuals.
[4104.18 → 4105.08] JIRA says,
[4105.16 → 4107.06] would you consider an option to get notified
[4107.06 → 4108.16] when Desk pad is in stock,
[4108.22 → 4108.66] like email?
[4109.32 → 4109.76] Luke,
[4110.42 → 4113.20] Flow plane is actually doing some Shopify development for us.
[4113.20 → 4114.88] Is an out-of-stock notification
[4114.88 → 4116.36] something that is in...
[4116.36 → 4117.84] I believe that's in the...
[4117.84 → 4118.00] Yeah.
[4118.40 → 4118.62] Yep.
[4119.08 → 4119.40] Okay.
[4120.06 → 4122.52] We're very, very much focused on verified actual gamer,
[4122.64 → 4126.02] but I'm fairly certain that is in the queue of things.
[4126.74 → 4127.44] Chris Diets ch,
[4127.50 → 4129.50] hopefully we're going to have you set up.
[4129.70 → 4131.36] Hopefully you'll be a verified actual gamer
[4131.36 → 4132.28] and get hooked up here.
[4132.68 → 4133.70] And the gaming sir says,
[4133.80 → 4134.32] as an American,
[4134.50 → 4135.54] I don't get to pick the tariffs.
[4135.88 → 4137.42] We deal with a price that's provided to us
[4137.42 → 4138.04] like anyone else,
[4138.04 → 4141.80] but I appreciate the effort to deal with our stupid trade war laws.
[4142.76 → 4144.42] And thanks for no more Raid Shadow Legends.
[4145.02 → 4147.06] We know you don't get to pick the tariffs.
[4147.28 → 4149.08] We deal with a price that's provided like everyone else.
[4149.20 → 4150.96] But what's confusing,
[4151.12 → 4151.36] I think,
[4151.40 → 4152.20] for a lot of Americans
[4152.20 → 4154.14] is that you guys were quoted MSRP
[4154.14 → 4155.36] when these products launched.
[4155.92 → 4157.76] And then after that,
[4158.32 → 4161.12] the US government added a 25% tariff,
[4161.48 → 4163.66] plus costs went up on a lot of the components.
[4164.00 → 4166.42] So now you might feel like you're getting swindled
[4166.42 → 4169.12] and like the retailers marking it up 25%,
[4169.12 → 4170.58] but actually it's a government tariff.
[4170.74 → 4173.18] A lot of people don't follow the news that carefully
[4173.18 → 4175.84] and they're not going to understand the difference there.
[4178.04 → 4179.38] General Disregard says,
[4179.48 → 4180.68] verified actual gamer program.
[4180.78 → 4181.62] Did it ever dawn on you
[4181.62 → 4183.26] that you're buying cards gamers could have
[4183.26 → 4185.16] and are now holding them for an excessive amount of time?
[4185.82 → 4186.84] How many are you holding?
[4187.12 → 4190.34] We've got in total about 500.
[4190.74 → 4191.76] Yes, it's a lot.
[4192.24 → 4194.48] But the only reason we're holding them
[4194.48 → 4197.28] is to make sure that they get into the hands of actual gamers
[4197.28 → 4199.72] and we will do it as soon as humanly possible.
[4199.90 → 4202.96] I have a very good feeling,
[4203.12 → 4204.44] and I'm not going to name any names
[4204.44 → 4209.38] because I'm just not interested in starting a gong show
[4209.38 → 4210.60] behind the scenes right now.
[4210.96 → 4212.78] But it is my belief
[4212.78 → 4215.94] that there are retailers that I know of
[4215.94 → 4219.86] who had stock at launch of cards
[4219.86 → 4221.18] that I know how much they got
[4221.18 → 4223.12] where the numbers didn't match up.
[4223.78 → 4225.36] And so it is my belief
[4225.36 → 4227.54] that these cards are safer in our warehouse
[4227.54 → 4230.86] than if we had given them to a retailer
[4230.86 → 4234.26] and hoped that they would make their way to gamers.
[4234.96 → 4237.54] And we're not holding them for that long.
[4237.80 → 4239.58] Yeah, we've only had them since I tweeted.
[4240.12 → 4241.88] That was when the first shipment arrived.
[4242.28 → 4244.38] The second shipment came after that one.
[4244.46 → 4245.46] And then the third one,
[4245.46 → 4248.22] the last 300 cards have not actually arrived yet.
[4248.22 → 4250.48] So we're dealing with it.
[4250.56 → 4251.54] We're working on it.
[4251.80 → 4253.40] It's just this has been technically
[4253.40 → 4255.12] quite a bit more difficult than we hoped.
[4255.60 → 4256.82] That's what it comes down to.
[4259.22 → 4262.20] I think there's one last super chat that I saw.
[4262.82 → 4263.54] Pwn for Skittles.
[4263.62 → 4264.16] Another $10,
[4264.52 → 4266.02] but I want to know what else I should eat for dinner.
[4266.14 → 4267.96] Skittles was a no-go last time.
[4268.02 → 4269.08] Try some shepherd's pie.
[4269.44 → 4271.56] I'm a big shepherd's pie guy.
[4271.74 → 4272.02] All right?
[4272.58 → 4273.26] You go for it.
[4273.26 → 4274.58] You enjoy that shepherd's pie.
[4275.06 → 4276.22] Think of me while you're eating it.
[4276.22 → 4278.20] Shoot, where there was one?
[4278.38 → 4278.78] Crap.
[4279.22 → 4279.72] Oh, yes.
[4279.80 → 4279.98] Okay.
[4280.14 → 4280.94] Last super chat.
[4281.04 → 4281.62] Faulty asks,
[4281.72 → 4282.60] who is the best pony?
[4285.30 → 4287.34] Definitely got to be Applejack for me.
[4287.52 → 4287.80] All right?
[4288.60 → 4291.66] This is like dead meme all day.
[4291.88 → 4292.26] Like, really?
[4292.34 → 4293.76] My little pony is like 2014.
[4294.66 → 4297.34] But yeah, definitely Applejack.
[4297.98 → 4298.88] Wait, are you a barony?
[4299.84 → 4301.32] So it's complicated, right?
[4301.64 → 4307.40] Because I definitely am not into like, you know, the fan art and stuff like that.
[4307.46 → 4309.74] That is 100% not my fang.
[4310.42 → 4310.64] Okay.
[4310.64 → 4313.28] I just don't get into any of that.
[4314.08 → 4316.06] I love the animation style.
[4316.14 → 4316.96] I think it's super cute.
[4317.02 → 4317.94] I think it's really fun.
[4318.00 → 4319.36] I think it's sweet.
[4319.36 → 4322.84] I love a lot of the music.
[4324.34 → 4325.20] What's his name?
[4325.30 → 4327.94] Daniel composer.
[4328.96 → 4329.70] Daniel Ingram.
[4330.12 → 4332.66] I think he is awesome.
[4333.30 → 4334.52] Just straight up.
[4334.66 → 4336.42] I absolutely love his work.
[4336.88 → 4337.74] He's a Canadian.
[4337.88 → 4339.78] He actually lives here in Vancouver.
[4340.74 → 4343.24] He's one of those people that's like low-key.
[4343.78 → 4347.00] I think just incredibly, incredibly talented.
[4347.40 → 4350.06] Some of the music in the show is, I think, outstanding.
[4351.20 → 4352.38] I just, I like it.
[4352.76 → 4354.98] I have watched it on my own.
[4355.32 → 4357.78] But typically, it's my daughters watch it.
[4357.92 → 4359.48] They're four and six.
[4359.90 → 4361.92] So they're right in that age.
[4361.94 → 4363.02] That lines up pretty well.
[4363.02 → 4363.34] They love it.
[4363.34 → 4365.54] And I enjoy it when I sit and watch it with them.
[4365.92 → 4366.38] Why not?
[4366.46 → 4366.82] Who cares?
[4369.80 → 4370.52] All right.
[4370.52 → 4373.36] Well, I think that's pretty much it.
[4373.50 → 4377.60] Thank you guys very much for tuning in to the WAN show.
[4377.82 → 4379.52] We will see you again next week.
