• The controversy surrounding NVIDIA's Founders Edition RTX 3070 Ti, specifically its existence and availability
• The 3070 Ti card was supposed to be released on the Best Buy website but went from "coming soon" to "out of stock" immediately
• Reseller groups and some users claim that no cards were actually available for sale on launch day
• Previous launches on Best Buy required a wait period before the card could be added to cart, but this was bypassed for the 3070 Ti
• NVIDIA's MSRP is not an enforceable pricing directive, as they do not manufacture the cards themselves
• The MSRP may have been set as a PR stunt, knowing that resellers would adjust prices according to market conditions
• There appears to be very little to no actual stock of the 3070 Ti available for consumers
• The 3070 has a crypto mining lock, but it's not outlandish and is a way better value than the 3090 at launch
• NVIDIA is trying to play both sides by pricing the 3070 competitively but allowing partners to sell at higher prices due to component shortages
• There are only two legitimate listings for the 3070 Ti Founders Edition on eBay, with one listing showing a suspiciously identical picture of the card in someone's home
• The scarcity of the 3070 Ti suggests that it may be difficult for consumers to purchase one
• Despite the limited availability, there is no evidence that anyone has actually used the 3070 Ti for gaming.
• NVIDIA released the RTX 3070 Ti at $599
• There appears to be a shortage of founders edition cards
• Some founders edition cards are being resold on StockX for high prices

• Discussion of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and its pricing strategy
• Criticism of NVIDIA for releasing a "Founder's Edition" with a low price, while AIBs (add-in board manufacturers) are selling the same card at much higher prices
