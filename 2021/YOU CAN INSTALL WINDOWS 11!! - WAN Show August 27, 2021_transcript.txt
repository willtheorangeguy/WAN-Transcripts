[0.00 --> 9.62]  and we're live i hope hello welcome to the wan show welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen
[9.62 --> 14.86]  we've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today a lot of good topics microsoft has
[14.86 --> 21.62]  updated clarified whatever word you want to use to describe it the windows 11 recommended system
[21.62 --> 27.48]  requirements now allow you to install it on an older pc so we're going to talk through all the
[27.48 --> 35.60]  details of that in other news western digital appears to have pulled an a data swapping out
[35.60 --> 42.66]  components on their solid state drives oh by the way samsung also got busted doing the same
[42.66 --> 47.28]  thing earlier this week so we're going to talk in more detail about that what else we got here
[47.28 --> 55.22]  only fans reverses their decision on banning adult content so dodged that didn't waste a bunch of
[55.22 --> 62.10]  development time there nice nice also tsmc has raised their prices by up to 20 and so
[62.10 --> 70.52]  has like global foundries psmc smic umc just everybody raising prices across the board electronics
[70.52 --> 74.86]  are about to get even more expensive ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and roll that
[74.86 --> 86.30]  intro hopefully there will be some good news as well nope only bad yeah actually there is good news
[86.30 --> 110.88]  and the show is brought to y'all today by our sponsors pdf element secret lab and green man gaming
[110.88 --> 116.82]  all right let's jump right into our first topic of the day microsoft has updated the windows 11
[116.82 --> 123.60]  recommended system requirements this comes to us courtesy of microsoft's own blog this is a little
[123.60 --> 129.98]  update on windows 11 minimum system requirements and the pc health check app if you guys didn't remember
[129.98 --> 138.12]  the pc health check app was this super basic tool that pretty much just said hey you're not eligible
[138.12 --> 145.72]  without really telling you exactly why which led to a fair bit of confusion in the windows community
[145.72 --> 152.84]  which is basically the pc user community although actually i actually hosted a facebook live audio room
[152.84 --> 158.56]  earlier that ended up being a fantastic discussion with the one and only wendell from level one text
[158.56 --> 166.12]  with the topic being linux then now and the future and he and i both agreed
[166.12 --> 176.04]  agreed for different reasons that desktop computing in the future could easily change over to linux
[176.04 --> 182.20]  um or at least i think i convinced him i think i convinced him of my rationale behind it and we can
[182.20 --> 186.50]  i don't know luke if you want to throw that in the doc we can talk about that a little bit more later but
[186.50 --> 192.30]  getting wendell's contribution side is probably really important i think it's pinned on our facebook page
[192.30 --> 198.62]  it's a live audio room anyway microsoft made a blog post today outlining their results from a revisit
[198.62 --> 204.38]  to the windows 11 system requirements and there's some good takeaways here and there's also some ones
[204.38 --> 210.46]  that are going to be really disappointing for a lot of people who bought computers not that long ago
[210.46 --> 216.06]  what they concluded is that the original list of compatible 64-bit processors
[216.06 --> 225.02]  um blah blah blah is the right minimum system requirements to deliver on the principles they
[225.02 --> 233.58]  established for the best user support so they're basically saying after further inspection we were
[233.58 --> 239.82]  we were correct they did however identify that there was a group of pc models that met the principles
[239.82 --> 249.42]  while running on 7th gen rather than 8th gen or higher cpus so intel's core 7820hq okay but this is
[249.42 --> 256.14]  only select devices that shipped with modern drivers based on declarative componentized hardware supported
[256.14 --> 264.22]  apps design principles including the surface studio 2 and intel's core x series and xeon w series so those
[264.22 --> 271.98]  are the only 7th gen cpus that they found met the requirement so to summarize this means that if you have a first gen
[271.98 --> 280.30]  ryzen cpu which uh last time i checked was really not that long ago i mean when did the ryzen 1600x launch
[281.02 --> 286.06]  2017 that that that was only is that right
[286.06 --> 298.86]  yep april 2017 just four years ago windows 11 is not for you and if you have a 7th gen cpu that isn't
[298.86 --> 306.38]  one of the ones that we just listed so basically most of them you are plum out of luck specific ryzen
[306.38 --> 315.50]  2000 series cpus are unsupported as well so specifically this would be ones like the 2200g and 2400g if i
[315.50 --> 322.62]  recall correctly those are not zen 2 based those are like zen plus or something like that are they zen
[322.62 --> 330.14]  one or what type of zen are they blah blah blah based on the zen architecture so they were named 2000 series
[330.14 --> 335.98]  but effectively they weren't i'm really glad that amd is cleaning up this problem with their processor
[335.98 --> 342.14]  naming scheme now for a while they had mobile cpus that sounded like they were a generation further
[342.14 --> 348.14]  along than they actually were and it looks like as we move into 5000 and 6000 series that should no
[348.14 --> 353.10]  longer be the case going forward i really hope they can keep that tidy there was really no excuse for
[353.10 --> 359.90]  how stupid that was now their reasoning for not adding more cpus or older ones to the list was due to
[360.54 --> 371.98]  reliability security and compatibility um sorry what they didn't provide any sort of granularity to these
[372.14 --> 380.30]  results though like do their their crash numbers apply to all seventh gen cpus or like so here here
[380.30 --> 386.86]  basically this is an imager capture of of what they mean by that so reliability means devices that do not
[386.86 --> 393.58]  meet the minimum system requirements had 52 percent more kernel mode crashes sort of raises a question who
[393.58 --> 399.66]  is that on is that on is that on microsoft or is that on the the device the person who didn't upgrade their
[399.66 --> 406.14]  computer devices that do meet the minimum system requirements had a 99.8 crash free experience
[407.58 --> 414.30]  okay security windows 11 raises the baseline blah blah blah etc etc compatibility people continue to
[414.30 --> 419.90]  increasingly use their pcs for video conferencing productivity and gaming and they set the minimum
[419.90 --> 424.54]  system requirements to align with some of the most commonly used apps well one issue i have with that
[424.54 --> 431.10]  is that basically just sounds like microsoft wants to hand over every user who only needs to do basic word
[431.10 --> 439.18]  processing and email to google okay microsoft says why don't you just buy a chromebook then to which
[439.18 --> 447.34]  people might reply i guess i will so that's interesting
[447.34 --> 459.90]  oh i have been trying so hard to find this audio room and i don't know if i'm just too young for
[459.90 --> 467.34]  facebook now or what but as far as i can tell it's just gone oh um if you message jono maybe he can
[467.34 --> 472.78]  either fix that or link you to where to find it according to the verge microsoft also clarified that
[472.78 --> 479.18]  they will only be enforcing their system requirements if you are upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11.
[479.18 --> 485.02]  this will not be enforced on clean installations of windows 11. so the good news from all of this
[485.02 --> 492.38]  is that microsoft is basically sticking to its guns saying for the best windows 11 experience you really
[492.38 --> 499.02]  should have a newer computer but if you install windows 11 clean from just from a usb thumb drive
[499.66 --> 505.02]  nothing will prevent you from installing it on an older machine so apparently this functionality is
[505.58 --> 512.78]  designed primarily for businesses to evaluate windows 11 and they will allow people to upgrade to
[512.78 --> 520.06]  it at their own risk in this fashion but the company can't guarantee driver compatibility and overall system reliability
[520.06 --> 526.06]  microsoft will not be recommending or advertising this method of installing windows 11 to consumers
[526.62 --> 534.70]  so that was a lot of doom and gloom and bad sounding stuff at the beginning of this segment but overall i think this is
[534.70 --> 546.46]  um about the best we could have expected now this is probably my tinfoil hat kind of coming out here a little bit
[546.46 --> 557.98]  but i think the big the big takeaway here is not the method by which microsoft is allowing windows 11 to be installed on older hardware
[558.54 --> 569.98]  but rather the specific users that microsoft is locking out of windows 11 and that would be people that are taking advantage of
[569.98 --> 580.62]  of loopholes in the microsoft free upgrade from older operating systems system that allow them to sort of um launder
[580.62 --> 590.94]  a pirated copy of windows by just upgrading it through multiple versions of windows um with that said so so it sounds like
[590.94 --> 598.06]  like they're trying to shed a lot of that dead weight that upgraded their their cracked versions of windows 7
[598.70 --> 605.10]  to windows 10 because that would be a group of users that is running older hardware with that said
[605.82 --> 613.50]  i can't see how anything would prevent you from taking that drive either installing it in newer system or
[613.50 --> 620.70]  cloning it over to a newer system and then performing the upgrade so there will still be ways to work
[620.70 --> 627.02]  around it but maybe it's just going to be a little more difficult overall because windows 11 is a bit
[627.02 --> 633.82]  of a nothing burger in terms of performance upgrades from what we saw at least for gaming there's no real
[633.82 --> 639.18]  reason for you to be worried about this in any way because you can still install it clean if you really
[639.18 --> 646.86]  want to and the probably the best way to pirate windows is the is the official way which is to just
[646.86 --> 651.82]  say no i don't have a license key when you're installing it and then just run it forever and
[651.82 --> 657.18]  not be able to change your desktop background oh except you can if you just right click on a picture
[657.18 --> 663.98]  and set as desktop background that's that's probably the the easiest way to to pirate windows these days
[663.98 --> 670.94]  so nothing prevents you from continuing to do that it's just that microsoft isn't going to condone you
[670.94 --> 679.02]  running older hardware so all right sounds good and i guess i don't have to worry too much about any of
[679.02 --> 687.98]  it um also because i i actually i finally activated the windows install on my home desktop luke i i did too
[687.98 --> 693.82]  i don't know if you know about that oh did you really why don't remember why i honestly don't remember
[693.98 --> 698.30]  it was quite a while ago though i think i was watching a movie full screen and i was just kind
[698.30 --> 702.94]  of tired of looking at the watermark and i was just like how much does this cost you know what fine
[704.38 --> 708.46]  i feel like i i like needed to for some reason or something um
[711.66 --> 719.82]  oh okay i was on a call i was on a work call not with an employee it was an external i don't remember
[719.82 --> 724.86]  who it was but it was like an external person and i was screen sharing and they like mentioned it
[724.86 --> 734.14]  and i was like yep that doesn't sound very pro so i fixed it yep that makes sense uh jake heaver is in
[734.14 --> 739.18]  floatplane chat says diy upgraders are such a small segment of the market they don't care about us they're
[739.18 --> 744.22]  drawing a line to maximize the amount of average users they can sell a new oem license to honestly
[744.22 --> 751.10]  i don't even think microsoft is after selling new oem licenses i don't think so it's it's not it's not
[751.10 --> 758.54]  that many i mean it's a lot to be clear like here let's let's pull up let's pull up windows 10
[758.54 --> 766.62]  on new egg okay here we go here we go all right windows 10 this one this one right here is the number
[766.62 --> 779.82]  one best seller in operating systems that makes sense whoa 1382 reviews now that's a lot you know
[779.82 --> 788.30]  like if i were to use if i were to extrapolate those numbers based on the um uh based on the numbers that
[788.30 --> 794.22]  i see for like the abcs of gaming on amazon how many we sold versus how many reviews those are i mean
[794.22 --> 799.18]  that's that's that's tens of thousands maybe into hundreds of thousands of units probably
[799.18 --> 803.50]  um especially when you factor in that there's other avenues by which microsoft can directly
[803.50 --> 810.14]  sell windows to users and there's other stores other than new egg but in the grand scheme of things
[810.14 --> 817.82]  okay let's go look for a ryzen 5600x cpu okay so let's go take one probably the most popular yep there it
[817.82 --> 829.66]  is the most popular desktop cpu holy smokes 1766 reviews for this thing something here doesn't
[829.66 --> 839.98]  compute there's only like what maybe so we got which which windows 10 so we got 64 bit oem we got
[839.98 --> 846.54]  the retail one with the thumb drive that's got another 300 views okay there's pro so that's another 13 oh wow
[846.54 --> 853.98]  no these are combined home and pro here 1382 uh there here's another boxed one here's a like a retail
[853.98 --> 860.78]  one uh this is combined with this one though oh that's hilarious 376 those are the same this 285 here
[860.78 --> 865.74]  oh whoops you guys can't see what i'm looking at here whoops sorry these two both have 285 so those
[865.74 --> 871.26]  appear to be a combined one as well um something doesn't compute clearly a lot of people are buying
[871.26 --> 882.78]  the most popular cpu and then not buying windows um so even the oem market what i'm trying to say
[882.78 --> 888.94]  is not as big of a deal as you might think what what microsoft is trying to do is they're trying to drive
[889.90 --> 896.06]  overall sales of new computers forward because that's something that microsoft stands to benefit
[896.06 --> 901.42]  from in the long term they want people when people buy a new computer they want them buying a new
[901.42 --> 906.62]  windows computer and they want that happening on a reasonably uh frequent basis because it's good
[906.62 --> 911.02]  for their partners what's good for the goose is good for the ganders and microsoft has taken that
[911.02 --> 922.38]  approach for a very very very long time so yeah i i i'm glad they're leaving us the capability to do it
[922.38 --> 927.34]  i mean i i think i suspect they they realize that there would have been people would have found a
[927.34 --> 933.50]  hacky way around it anyway so i'm glad they're just kind of accepting it but i also understand why they
[933.50 --> 938.46]  want people to have a good experience on windows 11 especially if a lot of their branding around windows
[938.46 --> 943.42]  11 is going to be you know this is the most reliable windows ever this is the most secure windows ever
[944.86 --> 951.10]  in other news speaking of reliability western digital has apparently pulled an a data
[951.10 --> 959.10]  data which is not a good thing we did a video recently outlining how a data has over the years
[960.30 --> 967.02]  played basically a component roulette with the components that might end up in your what was it
[967.02 --> 975.18]  the sx 8100 or 8200 i can't remember exactly the model yeah the model of ssd but we had our community
[975.18 --> 980.06]  submit and we actually paid them for them we bought them for i think it was like twice the market rate
[980.62 --> 986.70]  to make it worth people's time to reformat their machine but we we bought these a data ssds from
[986.70 --> 992.14]  our community and we compared them we benchmarked them we used the tool that allowed us to see exactly
[992.14 --> 998.62]  what components made them up and we got five different drives that had almost nothing in
[998.62 --> 1006.62]  common with each other and when you consider that an ssd is just a controller a dram cache assuming you get a
[1006.62 --> 1015.50]  decent one and nand flash if you change even one let alone two or all three of those components you
[1015.50 --> 1024.14]  are completely changing it to a different product so western digital has performed a nearly silent nand
[1024.14 --> 1033.18]  swap on the wd blue sn550 much like the recent incidents with a data and crucial this new nand on the sn5
[1033.18 --> 1039.42]  50 has significantly slower write speeds once the cache becomes exhausted according to extreme tech
[1039.42 --> 1047.10]  the average write speed when the static 12 gig slc cache is exhausted is as low as 394 megabytes per
[1047.10 --> 1053.50]  second on the new drive previous iterations of the drive would average around 610 after exhausting the
[1053.50 --> 1059.74]  cache that is a huge difference and the problem actually i i see a couple of problems here one of
[1059.74 --> 1070.22]  them is that this is on a drive that advertises write speeds of up to 2400 megabytes per second and
[1070.22 --> 1075.66]  the other is that the average user would have no way of knowing that a change like this has been made
[1076.22 --> 1082.14]  until all of a sudden they go to do something demanding with their drive and it's just slow and
[1082.14 --> 1090.06]  they don't understand why with a 12 gigabyte slc cache so if you guys aren't familiar an slc cache
[1090.06 --> 1098.38]  basically takes a component of your nlc or tlc or qlc nand so that's how many bits per cell are being
[1098.38 --> 1106.38]  stored and it operates it in slc or single bit per cell mode what that does is it effectively cuts in half
[1106.38 --> 1113.02]  or a third or even a quarter how much data you can store on that cache component but it makes it
[1113.02 --> 1119.02]  perform way better especially for writes and endurance as well actually for that matter
[1120.30 --> 1126.78]  all right so that slc cache super fast but and it's great for you know if you're installing
[1127.42 --> 1132.70]  photoshop or something like that that's going to happen real fast as fast as your cpu can keep up with
[1132.70 --> 1139.34]  decompressing the files and and uh feeding the ssd with data to write the problem is that as soon
[1139.34 --> 1145.50]  as you go to do something heavy 12 gigs is actually not that much in the context of let's say for
[1145.50 --> 1153.90]  example installing a vidya game like luke off the top of your head okay can you think of any games that
[1153.90 --> 1161.10]  are larger than 12 gigabytes hit me with one i can i can think of a game that's 10 over 10 times bigger
[1161.10 --> 1168.54]  than that um call of duty call duty is notoriously massive um the last few call of duty games have
[1168.54 --> 1177.02]  been like well over 100 gigs each um there's yeah the way these slc caches work is as long as everything
[1177.02 --> 1184.46]  you're doing fits within them everything is hunky dory everything's fast but once you are have the and
[1184.46 --> 1192.78]  then and then once the drive is idle it'll flush that cache slowly over time right out to the uh
[1193.34 --> 1200.46]  less performance you know tlc or qlc operating mode nand all right so if you were to go and install a
[1200.46 --> 1206.62]  massive game for example it is very conceivable that after a short period of time your performance
[1206.62 --> 1212.70]  would absolutely tank and now we're talking as low as about two-thirds of the performance that you would
[1212.70 --> 1217.90]  have had before the nand swap in the real world probably won't work out that way it probably
[1217.90 --> 1222.94]  won't affect it to that degree because there are other bottlenecks when you're installing a program
[1222.94 --> 1231.74]  unless you're just doing a raw file copy but it's not a good look so here is the statement they made
[1231.74 --> 1238.62]  to tom's hardware though in june 2021 we replaced the nand and the wd blue sn550 nvme ssd and updated the
[1238.62 --> 1244.06]  firmware at the time we updated the product data sheet for greater transparency going forward if
[1244.06 --> 1249.42]  we make a change to an existing internal ssd we commit to introducing a new model number whenever
[1249.42 --> 1253.82]  any related published specifications are impacted we value our customers and are committed to providing
[1253.82 --> 1258.62]  the best possible solutions for their data storage needs the issue is that this isn't the first time
[1258.62 --> 1266.78]  that wd has ever had egg on their face for not for for improperly labeling a drive i mean do you guys
[1266.78 --> 1273.82]  remember that whole shingled magnetic recording scandal it's a ring spell didn't wd issue a previous
[1273.82 --> 1282.54]  statement wd statement shingled drives let's see if i can find it wd admits two to six terabyte wd red
[1282.54 --> 1288.78]  nas drives use shingled magnetic recording which is really bad for nas operation let's see if we can
[1288.78 --> 1298.46]  find their statement blah blah blah blah blah blah smr issue blah blah wd comment here we go um
[1300.78 --> 1306.54]  okay blah blah blah workloads tend to be not found okay um
[1306.54 --> 1314.54]  here we go all right i got it you are correct that we do not specify the recording technology in our
[1314.54 --> 1319.82]  wd red hard drive documentation we strive to make the experience for our nas customers seamless
[1319.82 --> 1325.58]  and recording technology typically does not impact small business slash home nas based use cases
[1326.38 --> 1334.54]  so okay in fairness they did not commit at least in this statement to more accurately label their products
[1334.54 --> 1347.42]  so i guess that's um something uh so this is this is at least they didn't break their promise since
[1347.42 --> 1354.94]  they didn't make didn't make a promise they didn't make a promise last time um yeah the issue though is
[1354.94 --> 1359.58]  that if they truly value their customers it shouldn't have taken backlash from news outlets to make a
[1359.58 --> 1364.06]  statement on this and this should never have happened in the first place i mean barely anybody reads data
[1364.06 --> 1369.98]  sheets because marketing material is what you're you're supposed to be able to rely on it and i know
[1369.98 --> 1375.98]  i know people like us will say don't you know don't read in don't buy the marketing you know don't
[1375.98 --> 1384.14]  read into the marketing but but also when the marketing is just a specification you're not supposed
[1384.14 --> 1390.78]  to have to go find the separate list of specifications that's not fair and like i don't want to be that guy but
[1390.78 --> 1397.50]  it's it's a fairly boring product yeah that i think a lot of people want to be able to buy off of
[1397.50 --> 1404.06]  recommendation exactly recommendation could be out of date compared to your product sheet so it should
[1404.06 --> 1412.30]  really be a new model you do not want to read a hundred reviews of like a hundred dollar ssd you want
[1412.30 --> 1419.42]  to be able to trust that if you're buying from a company like western digital that it's just what it's
[1419.42 --> 1426.22]  supposed to be it's exactly the grade of product that you expect it to be like people buy based on
[1426.22 --> 1435.90]  a brand and of course wd has fantastic products like their uh what is it sn 850 uh black ssd it's
[1435.90 --> 1441.50]  really really really fast drive and so a lot of the time that's how halo marketing works right you have
[1441.50 --> 1446.78]  the best product on the market and so people just kind of go oh yeah they make good stuff uh but i can't
[1446.78 --> 1451.90]  afford their their best but it's all by this knowing that i can trust it when you pull a move
[1451.90 --> 1453.74]  like this you erode that trust
[1457.02 --> 1466.06]  oh right and in other news samsung actually pulled a similar move so the legendary 970 evo plus
[1466.06 --> 1473.66]  fantastic drive for the money samsung actually went and um this is really complicated it looks like my
[1473.66 --> 1481.58]  notes here don't cover all the details about this but basically what samsung did was because of the
[1481.58 --> 1490.54]  silicon shortage and because of the covert restrictions the factory that makes the controller in the 970 evo
[1490.54 --> 1496.46]  plus has apparently been offline since about february so due to shortages they're actually apparently using
[1496.46 --> 1502.86]  the same controller from the 980 pro this is all out of memory for me because these this is not in my
[1502.86 --> 1509.66]  notes but if i recall correctly that is the case right that sounds on paper like an upgrade right
[1511.18 --> 1519.66]  except that one of the key functions of the controller in the 980 pro is pci express gen 4 compatibility
[1520.54 --> 1530.22]  that's turned off so what samsung has done is they have increased the cache from 45 gigs to 112 gigs
[1530.22 --> 1537.18]  they've changed the packaging and the write speed when you're not using that slc cache so theoretically
[1537.18 --> 1541.90]  you might not notice this change because you've got a larger cache but the write speed when you're not
[1541.90 --> 1551.66]  using the cache has gone from about 1500 megabytes per second to just 800 so what sounds on the surface
[1551.66 --> 1561.50]  like an upgrade does not actually appear to be an upgrade which i would say is unfortunate but this
[1561.50 --> 1567.66]  isn't fortune this is intentional they knew it they knew they did it they changed the packaging
[1567.66 --> 1575.10]  and they expected us to just keep keep buying the 970 evo plus thinking that it's still the same drive
[1575.10 --> 1580.54]  we loved samsung come on you're the vertically integrated one you're the one that i'm supposed
[1580.54 --> 1587.98]  to be able to just recommend without worrying about it at all you know who i don't think has ever been
[1587.98 --> 1594.54]  embroiled in one of these controversies i don't think intel has i've had my own issues with intel ssds but
[1594.54 --> 1603.50]  crucial crucial has crucial ever pulled uh an ssd you know what i i think they have that kind of
[1603.50 --> 1610.30]  that kind of rings a bell i think crucial has probably has probably changed nand although i don't
[1610.30 --> 1616.38]  know if they've ever been caught with a clear downgrade i'll have to count on the chat to let me know
[1617.02 --> 1624.38]  buyer beware crucial swaps p2 ssds tlc nand for slower chips r.i.p. r.i.p crucial
[1625.50 --> 1633.10]  i tried i just kind of thought like i haven't heard any news about crucial in a long time so so maybe
[1633.10 --> 1638.54]  they're okay but apparently not black darkstorm asks what about sabrin i don't think sabrin has
[1638.54 --> 1646.46]  managed to attract any controversy yet but sabrin unlike a lot of these other companies wd crucial
[1646.46 --> 1654.62]  um intel not to a lesser extent now but at least before uh samsung for sure these guys are all to
[1654.62 --> 1660.94]  some extent vertically integrated which is to say that they manufacture the components that make up the
[1660.94 --> 1669.50]  finished product um this this news is from this month oh crucial yeah this was august 16th
[1670.30 --> 1677.02]  oh well that's awkward yeah uh okay gremlin injector says sk hynix but nobody cares about
[1677.02 --> 1681.34]  them and most of their customers are system integrators so for all we know they have swapped
[1681.34 --> 1684.94]  things but that would have been something they would have coordinated with the system integrator
[1684.94 --> 1690.46]  because no one cares about the spec of an sk hynix drive they care about the spec of the computer so as
[1690.46 --> 1695.90]  long as that's maintained then i guess it doesn't matter uh with that said sk hynix has some really
[1695.90 --> 1701.82]  solid drives these days like if i recall correctly they have it's not one of the most performant drives but
[1701.82 --> 1708.06]  their p31 this is off the top of my head sorry their p31 is super power efficient so in terms of
[1708.06 --> 1713.34]  performance per watt if i recall correctly that's a really outstanding drive uh they don't get enough
[1713.34 --> 1721.50]  credit because they've been around a long time making oem drives as you alluded to but they uh they just
[1721.50 --> 1728.70]  don't have the recognition in the consumer space uh max max the everything seven on float plane says i mean
[1728.70 --> 1735.02]  samsung had literally been pushing their 980 d ramless ssds on amazon as equal to their evo and pro lines
[1735.90 --> 1746.70]  yeah that's uh that's fair ascopty says keoxia i don't think keoxia has been nailed um i don't think so
[1747.82 --> 1756.22]  or even to shiba pre keoxia i mean one of the companies they acquired definitely ran afoul of uh these kinds of
[1756.22 --> 1761.82]  uh these kinds of guidelines we're providing you know don't change products without telling the
[1761.82 --> 1768.86]  consumer the keoxia or toshiba acquired ocz way back in the day and they they definitely they definitely
[1768.86 --> 1777.10]  had issues yeah that was yep just a few um sk hynix is is there is their public popularity more of a north
[1777.10 --> 1785.90]  american thing like the their lack of it you mean yeah that could be um i know that they've been
[1787.66 --> 1793.50]  if you remember when i was trying to get my like my ram and drives for my my previous geodude system
[1793.50 --> 1798.06]  yeah the problem was that they didn't have availability in north america not that they
[1798.06 --> 1808.06]  didn't have availability got it i don't know but i i think they're i'm not sure might be more
[1808.06 --> 1815.42]  popular elsewhere might just completely not be i don't know newegg has almost no reviews for pretty
[1815.42 --> 1822.78]  much anything sk hynix but the gold p31 that ssdi alluded to before um has almost a thousand ratings on
[1822.78 --> 1830.46]  amazon on amazon so it seems like that's something that they are addressing at least to a degree
[1832.86 --> 1842.46]  yeah wow their 500 gig version on newegg.com has over 4 000 reviews um five stars so it's funny because
[1843.34 --> 1850.46]  these fortunes always come and go right like sk hynix for many years like way back in the day i'm
[1850.46 --> 1857.02]  talking like 15 15 years ago right like sk hynix had a reputation for being like the crappy ram
[1857.02 --> 1863.26]  on your gpu that was kind of the only context that you'd have for sk hynix is like oh you better hope
[1863.26 --> 1868.22]  you get you get samsung chips because if you get the sk hynix version your ram won't overclock as well
[1868.22 --> 1874.14]  like stuff like that uh but nowadays they're actually building a reputation around you know power
[1874.14 --> 1880.06]  efficiency and solid performance even if it's not you know industry leading performance
[1880.06 --> 1885.10]  like i don't even think they have a gen 4 drive yet they're they're going slow slow and steady wins
[1885.10 --> 1897.58]  the race i guess yeah not that slow and steady will win the race to our sponsors hey uh check this out

[1997.58 --> 2005.18]  who are wondering if you want the inside scoop on secret lab uh secret lab was who alex chose for his
[2005.18 --> 2013.50]  gaming chair or really well everything chair uh for his intel extreme tech upgrade and i haven't personally used
[2013.50 --> 2022.14]  a secret labs chair but i can say that i have a lot of experience with the product and it's really good
[2023.18 --> 2030.06]  they make great chairs and they are they are my favorite chairs there's a lot of gaming chairs out there that
[2030.70 --> 2040.22]  suck um i i mean man back back when we were reviewing gaming chairs i was amazed at how same they could
[2040.22 --> 2048.22]  look yet how different they could be like a razi comes to mind as one that looks fine but is incredibly
[2048.22 --> 2053.98]  uncomfortable um oh i should probably shouldn't be bad mouthing other brands in a sponsor spot for
[2053.98 --> 2060.14]  another brand do those guys even exist anymore though they probably don't oh wow they do well i don't know
[2060.14 --> 2066.70]  who knows maybe they're better now the point is i know for sure secret labs products really good um
[2067.34 --> 2073.90]  did i did i just close my my doc that had all my notes in it that's uh this is really awkward this

[2196.62 --> 2202.54]  close it's actually pretty close to the limit for weight that we can ship internationally without
[2202.54 --> 2210.62]  incurring like enormous shipping fees wow so yeah it's it's really it's like really big and really heavy
[2210.62 --> 2216.70]  all right let's move on to another topic what else we got luke hit me uh there's some interesting ones
[2216.70 --> 2221.82]  in the in the rapid fire section we could talk about only fans um only fans reverses their decision
[2221.82 --> 2227.42]  to ban adult content so if you watch the last wang show we talked about it extensively only fans was
[2227.42 --> 2233.50]  like no more porn is allowed on only fans some lewd content is going to be allowed we'll tell you more
[2233.50 --> 2238.70]  about it later and then just like kind of dropped the whole conversation and has now come back and said
[2238.70 --> 2245.26]  uh psych never mind everything's fine um the this this change is coming yeah less than a week after
[2245.26 --> 2250.06]  their initial announcement that they were planning to end adult hosted content not all of it but yeah
[2250.06 --> 2255.98]  um they've now secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have
[2255.98 --> 2262.46]  suspended the planned october 1 policy change um they're now preaching inclusion and saying they will
[2262.46 --> 2268.62]  provide a home for all creators i'm sure this comes off the back of probably a lot of creators jumping ship
[2268.62 --> 2275.66]  uh yeah a little bit the considering the point industry is worth billions of dollars estimates say
[2278.06 --> 2284.70]  six to 97 billion what that's a big range that's a massive range uh there is clearly someone out there
[2284.70 --> 2289.82]  willing to pocket transaction fees yeah of course of course um i mean this is something that we know
[2289.82 --> 2296.22]  from research that we've done on this topic like i mean luke you've looked into alternate payment
[2296.22 --> 2302.06]  processing platform platforms before i'm going to say alternate i mean ones that are willing to uh
[2302.62 --> 2306.70]  process your payments sort of regardless of what type of content you have on your site
[2306.70 --> 2312.38]  i can you can you talk a little bit about what that looks like they're really expensive um and they
[2312.38 --> 2317.26]  they always have been really expensive because they they kind of know it's it they're in a weird spot
[2317.26 --> 2323.90]  because they they seem to understand that if you are talking to them you have to be talking to them
[2323.90 --> 2329.82]  um right and it's it's i don't know how many market segments are like that where like you're the not
[2329.82 --> 2335.02]  as good product but you know that because you're the not as good product if someone is talking to you
[2335.02 --> 2338.46]  they don't have the option of using the better products so you can actually charge them more
[2339.34 --> 2345.90]  um right what makes the payment processor not as good though like help me out here um user experience
[2345.90 --> 2353.18]  can be pretty bad uh the support on the back end um the the developer friendliness of it um
[2354.06 --> 2359.02]  compliance to different browser things there's there's a lot that can be very annoying um so you
[2359.02 --> 2363.90]  gloss over that stuff but that's really interesting stuff that i think the average person would not know
[2363.90 --> 2370.94]  about so yeah right and the average person basically never has to run into it because pretty much the
[2370.94 --> 2377.02]  whole internet doesn't run on those types of payment processors uh most payment processes people
[2377.02 --> 2383.82]  use are are from a very small grouping of payment processors that are very clean uh you you generally
[2383.82 --> 2390.46]  only deal with like like amazon payments google payments apple payments uh shopify is actually really
[2390.46 --> 2400.86]  massive um stripe and and paypal or paypal trading as braintree um and there isn't like a ton outside
[2400.86 --> 2406.62]  of that there's some exola stuff if you did uh twitch back in the day and there was problems with that
[2406.62 --> 2410.94]  and that's part of the reason why that's being phased out as far as i can tell uh and some other
[2410.94 --> 2418.78]  things but like it's it's really annoying for everyone involved if the payment process is not basically
[2418.78 --> 2425.66]  perfect right so if it's not pretty much perfect people don't want to use it and they're going to file
[2425.66 --> 2430.62]  down into these uh these major payment processors we've got people in the float plane chat
[2430.62 --> 2435.74]  that are talking about crappy payment processors uh and just the bad experiences they've had with
[2435.74 --> 2441.74]  them so mills jonah says i've had experiences with payment processors just not registering that i
[2441.74 --> 2450.62]  canceled a subscription and then i had to fight for a refund um let's see here uh yep uh pan pan
[2450.62 --> 2458.62]  beach says implementation bugs poorly documented api uh happy roll cake says uh epoch apparently wouldn't
[2458.62 --> 2464.78]  remove their card details from their server apparently shopify payments is built on stripe
[2464.78 --> 2471.02]  so that's even more of like yeah like why why deal with with difficult things a lot of a lot of uh
[2471.02 --> 2476.54]  consolidation has happened in the payment space over the years right that makes sense um and to be
[2476.54 --> 2483.58]  clear i personally do not believe that this move was ever anything to do with only fans not having any
[2483.58 --> 2490.54]  way to process payments i mean the porn industry has been around as long as the internet has existed i
[2490.54 --> 2496.94]  mean i i wonder if there's i wonder if there's actually like like an like a historical sort of a
[2496.94 --> 2504.46]  record of this like first nude picture on the internet that was probably really early i'm suspecting
[2504.46 --> 2511.50]  there's gotta be there's gotta be what is this what is this useless page here what what am i looking
[2511.50 --> 2518.14]  at okay brief history of well while you look for that i just uh something we're actually quite happy
[2518.14 --> 2524.94]  about is that we decided not to pursue creating an alternative uh because psych probably most people
[2524.94 --> 2531.18]  that are on there are going to stay i do think a very significant amount of people have probably left
[2531.18 --> 2538.86]  and just uh as someone who kind of used to be i guess a creator uh to other potential creators
[2538.86 --> 2544.70]  i would highly recommend diversifying your platforms um hopefully this was enough of a like
[2544.70 --> 2549.82]  kick in the butt to get you to do that uh but even if you're still on that platform and you're like
[2549.82 --> 2557.66]  oh my like livelihood isn't being ripped out from under me that's great and i'm i'm happy for you about that
[2557.66 --> 2562.22]  but you should also definitely diversify your platforms um i don't have an offering for you
[2562.78 --> 2567.66]  so this is not even self-pandering but you should still do it try to find somewhere else that you can
[2567.66 --> 2575.18]  set up shop as well um even if you're just mirroring your uploads on both platforms whatever having a base
[2575.18 --> 2583.18]  somewhere is very valuable yep um so i mean really it appears that it had everything to do with
[2583.18 --> 2590.46]  raising funds and taking on investors um the thing is that only fans appeared to have overplayed their
[2590.46 --> 2597.18]  hand a little bit it seems like uh more than luke and i anticipated there must be safe for work content
[2597.18 --> 2605.18]  on only fans it's just that maybe what they felt was that the safer work content had this momentum
[2605.18 --> 2609.82]  that would carry them through this transition but maybe what they didn't realize was that
[2610.46 --> 2616.38]  the only reason safe for work content creators were surviving on the platform was that so many
[2616.38 --> 2621.90]  users were being driven to it by not safe for work content because once you're in the habit of using a
[2621.90 --> 2630.38]  platform it's i mean how how do i put this there's only so many hours a day that you could comfortably
[2631.02 --> 2639.74]  you know enjoy pornography i i think i think i i think okay look don't don't don't quote me on
[2639.74 --> 2646.38]  this i actually really would prefer not to be quoted on this um but then you know at some point you'll
[2646.38 --> 2652.94]  be done so to speak someone watching was just like challenge accepted at some point you'll be done and
[2652.94 --> 2659.58]  you'll like want to do something else and if only fans played their cards right they could easily entice
[2659.58 --> 2666.46]  you to go do something safe for work at the same time so it seems like they they misinterpreted that
[2666.46 --> 2674.30]  momentum in safer work content as sort of a change in their identity as a platform but what it actually
[2674.30 --> 2686.70]  was is just uh a break so to speak yeah so i i think if they're smart they will just keep making their
[2686.70 --> 2693.10]  ludicrous amounts of money 600 million dollars a year or whatever not bother taking on investors
[2693.10 --> 2698.46]  buy mega yachts for all of their founders because that's the kind of freaking money that they're
[2698.46 --> 2704.54]  making right now and just chillax with the whole investor thing or create a sister site you know
[2704.54 --> 2708.78]  i mean that was that was the way that we were planning to address adult content so there's no
[2708.78 --> 2714.94]  reason they couldn't do the same thing reverse yeah and you can use your your adult content platform to
[2714.94 --> 2719.26]  get that sister site off the ground absolutely absolutely instead of driving people
[2719.26 --> 2726.62]  to like a creator on only fans that's safe for work you could drive a creator to this sister site
[2726.62 --> 2731.50]  i mean since only fans uh most of the interactions remember we started one recently most of the
[2731.50 --> 2736.62]  interactions are done through the website like just the mobile browser rather than an app because of
[2737.18 --> 2743.82]  just prudish app store policies um so there nothing would prevent you from just having that
[2743.82 --> 2749.26]  link open in a comp on a completely different site you could probably even maintain login credentials
[2749.26 --> 2755.82]  luke is that something you could do from a user privacy user security i think there are some issues
[2755.82 --> 2759.58]  there there's probably some there's probably some i'm not 100 certain but i'm i'm pretty sure there's
[2759.58 --> 2764.06]  some issues there because it's a different you have different agreements on both sites oh that's that's
[2764.06 --> 2770.62]  yeah that makes sense yeah uh in other like in really bad news how about we just put it that way
[2770.62 --> 2779.02]  tsmc will be raising their prices by up to 20 this comes courtesy of tom's hardware and the wall street
[2779.02 --> 2787.98]  journal uh yes my friends that is how mainstream this bad news is getting world's largest chip maker to
[2787.98 --> 2796.14]  raise prices threatening costly electronics this is not a threat this is reality this is just happening so
[2796.14 --> 2804.94]  seven nanometer and smaller wafers will increase as much as 10 percent while 16 nanometer and larger
[2804.94 --> 2813.18]  nodes will increase by 20 percent for all orders set to be fulfilled starting in december tsmc's yeah go
[2813.18 --> 2820.54]  ahead i just said real like it's it's coming up basically now yep by the time if you were hoping that
[2820.54 --> 2827.26]  you know the the shortage would go away and prices would fall it looks like by the time that would
[2827.26 --> 2834.22]  have any hope of happening whatsoever the raw prices of the materials will be going up although um
[2835.58 --> 2840.46]  maybe that'll help with the shortage if fewer people can afford to buy anything
[2842.14 --> 2846.46]  that's not the solution we want i also don't think it will because everything's just getting scalped
[2846.46 --> 2855.66]  every anyways right tsmc's n5 and n7 fabrication was 49 of their 13.29 billion in revenue in the
[2855.66 --> 2864.86]  second quarter of 2021 while n16 and n28 accounted for 25 of q2 revenue so companies like amd and qualcomm
[2864.86 --> 2871.66]  could see increased prices in the near future as well as asic manufacturers like bitmain tsmc isn't the
[2871.66 --> 2877.82]  only one though global foundries psmc smic and umc have all increased production prices recently and
[2877.82 --> 2883.26]  you can bet that intel with the investments that they're making in new fabs right now is going to
[2883.26 --> 2890.14]  be following suit even as they get into the fabrication business and try to increase competition in that
[2890.14 --> 2897.90]  space and the worst part of this guys is these numbers we're quoting you 10 20 you will be lucky
[2897.90 --> 2905.98]  if that's all you see in terms of end sticker price increase because that ain't the way it works
[2905.98 --> 2914.06]  typically just rough ballpark numbers typically for every one percent that you increase the basic bill
[2914.06 --> 2920.70]  of materials cost of a product you can expect to see about a two percent increase in the final end
[2920.70 --> 2927.34]  product once all the all the middlemen and stakeholders and packaging and marketing and blah blah blah blah blah
[2927.34 --> 2933.42]  that's kind of your basic guideline for how much you can expect an increase in materials cost to
[2933.42 --> 2941.26]  affect the finished product so that's rough because a 10 increase in the cost of the chip that goes at the
[2941.26 --> 2947.26]  heart of your gpu means that you could probably end up spending i would say on like a high-end gpu
[2947.26 --> 2952.62]  easily another fifty two hundred dollars don't underestimate how much this is going to suck
[2952.62 --> 2958.22]  oh i think it could be more than that you said high-end gpu i think it'd be more than that for
[2958.22 --> 2962.38]  sure well remember too though that a lot of the cost of a high-end gpu is in memory as well
[2963.10 --> 2970.54]  uh a lot of the cost is in power delivery okay yeah so yeah good point i'm talking just the chip yeah
[2972.46 --> 2977.26]  yeah kind of crazy that it's across the board this also like we we saw the gpu shortage kind of
[2979.10 --> 2982.60]  barely but we saw it kind of showing signs of going away but
[2982.62 --> 2988.06]  uh this i have a feeling is not going to be reversed this is the same so this is probably
[2988.06 --> 2995.34]  here to stay yeah and the the thing is that prices are whatever the market will bear and nvidia had for
[2995.34 --> 3002.94]  a long time been playing a game of let's just quietly increase prices each generation one of the most
[3002.94 --> 3010.38]  egregious ones was when the gtx 680 came out if you guys recall the gtx 680 it was actually priced
[3010.38 --> 3017.02]  very competitively compared to its predecessor the gtx 580 or was it 580 gtx i can't remember when
[3017.02 --> 3022.78]  they moved the things around but it doesn't matter the 680 uh sounded like a deal compared to the 580
[3022.78 --> 3030.14]  except for one small detail that's the 680 used their what what what was 680 maxwell
[3030.14 --> 3037.98]  the firm firmie then kepler i don't remember the point is it used their next tier down you didn't
[3037.98 --> 3045.98]  even use their largest chip whereas previously eight class gpus had always used their largest chip so they
[3045.98 --> 3053.58]  were effectively selling you like a a high-end rather than enthusiast end gpu for the same price that the
[3053.58 --> 3059.90]  previous generation enthusiast one went for it wasn't until we got the i want to say 780
[3060.94 --> 3065.82]  because the higher end 6 was 690 that was a dual gpu chip it wasn't until we got the 780
[3065.82 --> 3070.78]  that that large chip finally made its way into a consumer product and by then they had managed to
[3070.78 --> 3075.02]  increase the price compared to the 580. so nvidia has been playing this game for a long time but
[3075.66 --> 3080.30]  this pandemic situation the shortage situation has given them an excuse to just
[3080.30 --> 3087.90]  you know skip a bunch of steps and when things settle down they will settle but i would be very
[3087.90 --> 3096.78]  surprised if we ever see another top tier gpu for you know 699 749. i i think i think those days are
[3096.78 --> 3103.82]  over yep agreed do you want to talk about the linux desktop future thing um i want to talk about the apple
[3103.82 --> 3109.90]  settling their developer class action lawsuit thing because this has huge implications and i'd like to
[3109.90 --> 3113.82]  kick it off uh you you can run through the topic because this is something you're a little bit
[3113.82 --> 3121.82]  better versed in than me but i want to kick it off by saying to everyone who uh defended apple's behavior
[3121.82 --> 3129.10]  and said that apple is not a monopoly and the app store is just uh their their playground their rules
[3129.10 --> 3139.26]  um this is apple's admissions essentially that you're wrong their behavior was bad and you are
[3139.26 --> 3147.18]  actually wrong and you need to go read go read go read about antitrust go read about anti-monopoly
[3147.18 --> 3154.78]  laws go read please because i am really i have gotten so many frustrating stupid tweets about this
[3155.50 --> 3162.78]  every time i talk about it i just get these horrendously bad takes apple's behavior is bad it's
[3162.78 --> 3168.46]  really bad and the fact that they're settling this the fact that they're settling this to the tune of
[3168.46 --> 3178.06]  100 million dollars in a small developer fund tells you how bad it is and how badly they want this to
[3178.06 --> 3185.42]  go away and not this is not this is not the epic lawsuit no this isn't even the epic lawsuit yet
[3185.98 --> 3192.14]  okay so luke why don't you run us through this okay so this one's a little weird and i haven't like
[3192.14 --> 3198.62]  fully dove into it because it's not the epic one um but in a settlement pending court approval apple
[3198.62 --> 3204.30]  agrees to um a bunch of different terms clarify that developers can communicate directly with
[3204.30 --> 3210.54]  customers about alternative payment options outside of the app this is very good very happy about that
[3210.54 --> 3215.34]  that's like the core thing for us that's the main thing we're excited about um they they can however
[3215.34 --> 3220.70]  use contact information gleaned from the app now with permission yeah yeah whatever um they are also
[3220.70 --> 3225.26]  establishing this is the part that's like a little odd for me and i haven't dove far enough into
[3225.26 --> 3230.94]  they're establishing a 100 million dollar small developer fund uh ranging between 250 bucks to
[3230.94 --> 3237.02]  30 000 to developers based on their size yeah that i'm not 100 certain like how that's supposed to work
[3237.02 --> 3242.54]  also it's like not really 100 million dollars it's closer to 70 but we'll get more into that in a moment
[3242.54 --> 3248.86]  um also they are going to keep the small business program for another three years expand price points
[3248.86 --> 3254.46]  clarify that developers can appeal rejections commit to develop search and discovery to drive high
[3254.46 --> 3259.66]  quality apps that one's a little interesting not 100 certain how that actually ties into the rest of
[3259.66 --> 3265.66]  it but whatever um and issue a transparency report about apps that are rejected and customer and developer
[3265.66 --> 3271.02]  accounts that are also rejected that part is nice as well i like that one too because sometimes it's
[3271.02 --> 3277.42]  really hard to tell why the heck your thing actually got rejected and if you guys remember we got stuck in a
[3277.42 --> 3285.34]  a many month long rejection loop that they eventually just admitted like oh yeah we just actually like
[3285.34 --> 3291.58]  never really reviewed it um yeah and it has been fine for a long time and all these revisions of the
[3291.58 --> 3295.58]  app that you guys made trying to be more and more compliant was actually useless because you guys were
[3295.58 --> 3302.14]  fine from many months ago that was incredibly frustrating yeah um something kind of funny kind of awkward
[3302.14 --> 3306.14]  kind of annoying i don't know enough about the legal space to actually understand
[3308.06 --> 3315.50]  how off base or on base this is to be completely honest um like this might be totally normal it
[3315.50 --> 3321.82]  doesn't sound normal to me but that 100 million dollars small developer assistance fund uh the lawyers
[3321.82 --> 3329.82]  that won this suit so we're happy about reached a settlement with apple right yes um we're happy that this is
[3329.82 --> 3335.90]  happening they're happy we're happy that they got there but the lawyers are planning on taking or i
[3335.90 --> 3342.86]  don't think it's planning i believe they just are taking 30 million dollars of the 100 million dollar
[3342.86 --> 3350.06]  small developer assistance fund um i know there's a lot of like different weird ways that lawyers are
[3350.06 --> 3355.90]  compensated for their work so i don't know how like normal this is i don't know how normal this would be
[3355.90 --> 3364.30]  yeah yeah that's not unusual for a lawyer to work for a very low rate with the um goal of being of
[3364.30 --> 3370.30]  winning the case with as large a settlement as possible and then getting paid out of that settlement
[3370.30 --> 3376.54]  and in fact it's one of the biggest problems with class action suits in general is that the only real
[3376.54 --> 3383.98]  beneficiary is lawyers so there's this constant incentive for lawyers to just file more and more and more of
[3383.98 --> 3392.78]  these suits because uh they basically get to go after a nice a nice juicy vein uh to suck onto
[3392.78 --> 3398.30]  that company gets to pay a whack of money because probably they did something wrong you know or maybe
[3398.30 --> 3403.18]  not i don't know whatever they've managed to the lawyers managed to win the lawsuit and then the actual
[3403.18 --> 3410.06]  end users who were affected by this in some in some meaningful way in a lot of cases um i mean i've seen
[3410.06 --> 3414.94]  settlements as small as like five dollars right like it's not it's not an amount of money that is
[3414.94 --> 3421.10]  almost not even worth filing for yeah yeah that is meaningful in any way so the lawyer so you know
[3421.10 --> 3426.46]  let's say you had a million dollar settlement 30 of it goes to the lawyer or the law firm so that's
[3426.46 --> 3433.98]  like 300 grand and then you know two dollars each to the you know what would that like five dollars each to
[3433.98 --> 3440.78]  the what would that work out to like 100 000 people 120 000 people affected it's like okay
[3441.34 --> 3446.94]  uh so basically the only purpose it served was getting the company to admit that they were wrong
[3447.58 --> 3453.82]  and then lawyers get money um yeah it's a big problem i don't know how to fix it people in flow
[3453.82 --> 3458.62]  plane chat are saying that it's extremely normal for attorneys to take like 30 40 percent i saw someone
[3458.62 --> 3464.70]  else say it normally 20 who knows either way i think this is as outrageous as it sounds i think
[3464.70 --> 3472.14]  it's not technically out to lunch which is which is kind of nuts um and while some people are are
[3472.14 --> 3477.58]  trying to style on the lawyers for for doing this and the fact that they have four pages of reasons why
[3477.58 --> 3484.06]  they should get the 30 million dollars which just sounds funny um i'm just happy that we're moving
[3484.06 --> 3490.46]  forward i'm not super concerned about the small developer fund there is a huge amount of developers
[3490.46 --> 3495.90]  i suspect we would probably be considered under that and we would probably get next to nothing and it's
[3495.90 --> 3503.26]  not going to matter um what does matter is we're moving towards uh better payment solutions for the app
[3503.26 --> 3511.50]  store and we're moving towards apple kind of admitting faults and i feel like them losing this one
[3511.50 --> 3519.58]  might help the like epic case which is more the one that we're actually hoping to to go through so
[3519.58 --> 3525.98]  yeah we'll have to see a long time though because epic will epic is asking for a lot more than these
[3525.98 --> 3532.30]  developers were uh there are some really funny stories in float plane chat uh alana katian i think
[3532.30 --> 3537.42]  i got six dollars out of a class action suit against google computer whisperer says i got a dollar
[3537.42 --> 3544.94]  95 from a paypal lawsuit uh this is great cmd underscore says i still have the never cashed check
[3544.94 --> 3549.82]  for a dollar 25 or something from a class action about a company using robo dialers
[3550.94 --> 3559.26]  this is great oh man oh yeah and so west uh t27 says admits they were wrong okay yeah most of the
[3559.26 --> 3564.22]  settlements usually say something to the effect of claims no fault that's a lot of the time um
[3564.22 --> 3570.54]  um part of the the payout is you know we're yeah you're right uh they're gonna say no we didn't
[3570.54 --> 3575.58]  do anything wrong because if they do then it could open themselves up to more lawsuits and you know
[3576.14 --> 3582.46]  because obviously if they did something wrong once they probably did it wrong twice um so yeah yep you're
[3582.46 --> 3589.34]  probably right but i still think that this will add fuel the fact that apple settled whatever they legally
[3589.34 --> 3597.10]  said or not does say something about uh how how vulnerable they think that they are right now and
[3597.10 --> 3603.58]  the fact that they settled for so much would seem to indicate that they're trying to buy a lot of good
[3603.58 --> 3609.90]  will right now um yeah they have not gotten a lot of good press for the way that they've treated app
[3609.90 --> 3617.58]  developers speaking of yeah i would i would have liked more stuff in there that helps the app developers in
[3617.58 --> 3624.94]  real ways instead of this like small developer fund thing which is not actually going to really help
[3624.94 --> 3631.10]  very many small app developers in the long run um and was just like looted for 30 million dollars from
[3631.10 --> 3636.78]  the lawyers i i wish there was more actual stuff coming through but at least there's some stuff coming
[3636.78 --> 3645.74]  through and hopefully it sets precedent but i don't know yeah i don't know what to tell you uh in other in
[3645.74 --> 3653.42]  other news uh what did i want to talk about here ah yes samsung is bricking the z fold and z flip 3's
[3653.42 --> 3663.58]  cameras if you unlock the bootloader oh that sucks um if you're a tinker like they already make it
[3663.58 --> 3671.66]  really difficult to get root file system access it's also very intentional like it's not it's not like oh we
[3671.66 --> 3676.70]  overlooked this thing and it happens to brick it when you unlock the thing it's it's definitely on
[3676.70 --> 3686.30]  purpose and it's just like i understand blah blah samsung nox blah blah security but the fact is that
[3686.30 --> 3693.10]  this is a feature that turns perfectly working hardware into a brick once you stop supporting it
[3693.10 --> 3697.82]  with your software updates which your samsung you're going to do that at some point
[3697.82 --> 3705.50]  um so xca senior members oh boy uh white bear is i think the direct translation from the chinese name
[3705.50 --> 3714.22]  and uh ian mac d um showed the final confirmation screen during the bootloader unlock process on the
[3714.22 --> 3721.02]  z fold 3 that mentions that completing the operation will cause the camera to be disabled so this isn't
[3721.02 --> 3727.74]  without precedent sony pulled this with their xperia devices um if you unlocked the bootloader of
[3728.22 --> 3733.58]  any sony xperia device it would result in nothing but green pictures other software features like
[3733.58 --> 3737.90]  sony's video and audio enhancements were similarly borked i would have to assume that this is to
[3737.90 --> 3744.46]  prevent anyone from reverse engineering the way that their enhancements work that would be the only
[3744.46 --> 3750.78]  good reason i could think of for sony to implement it in that particular way but the big problem here is
[3750.78 --> 3757.66]  that if samsung becomes as locked down as apple a lot of the benefits of going android well with
[3757.66 --> 3767.34]  a samsung device go away compared to just buying an iphone in the first place um yeah i'm i'm not
[3767.34 --> 3773.74]  that into that what i am into though apparently there have been some workarounds already found so
[3773.74 --> 3780.30]  that's good to know that's good what i am into though is reading some super chats now i didn't get
[3780.30 --> 3786.78]  all of them because i specifically intentionally didn't click the viewer activity tab at the
[3786.78 --> 3792.46]  beginning of the wan show my apologies to anyone who sent one you were sacrificed for the greater good
[3792.46 --> 3799.50]  because google asked me to screen record the problem that i've been having and i did manage to record it
[3799.50 --> 3806.38]  so i have a screen recording of super chats coming in in the chat on the right and then the viewer
[3806.38 --> 3811.90]  activity tab being empty and then i click the viewer activity tab and they start populating
[3811.90 --> 3816.54]  which is really stupid and not supposed to happen so hopefully they'll be able to fix it
[3816.54 --> 3822.70]  um so you're like i said your sacrifice was for the greater good lilith gaming says i want to build my
[3822.70 --> 3828.70]  first ever pc um what should i go for for a good experience well you should watch one of our build
[3828.70 --> 3834.70]  guides and then you should post on the linus tech tips forum in the new pc a new new build section
[3834.70 --> 3839.42]  people will help you find the the right components for your budget and for what you're trying to do
[3839.98 --> 3847.34]  like the best part of the forum um johnny let's look i don't know how to pronounce that can we use
[3847.34 --> 3854.78]  lightly overclocked amd fx 95 90s as a loophole for california's electricity bill it's pretty much a
[3854.78 --> 3861.02]  good idea to build a pc with that processor when you think about it i have no idea what you're trying
[3861.02 --> 3868.54]  to get at um the new as far as my understanding goes those laws only apply to systems sold not new new
[3868.54 --> 3876.46]  systems sold um which you will not be putting an amd fx 95 90 in and number two um
[3877.66 --> 3886.62]  an overclocked fx 95 90 um that is one of the most inefficient modern era processors
[3887.98 --> 3894.54]  you just like i don't get it you shouldn't buy one i guess is what i'm trying to say
[3895.66 --> 3901.98]  uh i know i would not recommend that i would not recommend that uh tech kev says i just watched your
[3901.98 --> 3905.50]  video on a customizable laptop very good showing what you could do with it did you or did you not
[3905.50 --> 3911.02]  invest in their company i did i have a video coming soon um so i'm gonna kind of talk about
[3911.02 --> 3918.22]  why i made that decision uh matt shatak says i've built several e-commerce sites and developer
[3918.22 --> 3921.18]  friendliness is definitely a significant factor for choosing a payment processor
[3922.22 --> 3928.78]  both stripe and square have been awesome i can't say i share your experience with stripe but um has that
[3928.78 --> 3933.18]  changed luke are they better now no stripes been good okay i've seen pretty good the whole time
[3933.74 --> 3937.98]  i thought they were a pain in the butt at the beginning braintree and paypal oh all right
[3939.18 --> 3946.06]  paypal good old paypal alex and simba says linus do you have any plans to do another verified
[3946.06 --> 3953.10]  actual gamer drop i'm sure there's several of us still waiting for a decent price yes we actually have
[3953.10 --> 3961.34]  a hundred if i recall correctly they are 30 80 ti's coming from i think it's msi don't quote me on that
[3961.34 --> 3968.62]  yeah pretty sure oh do you know that yeah is that right okay yep so it's not dead ladies and gentlemen
[3968.62 --> 3974.06]  it's coming back ah this one's been planned and ready for so long
[3976.38 --> 3981.66]  it's actually been forever yeah i know uh northern rebel 27 says we're in a bad spot right now with the
[3981.66 --> 3985.58]  chip shortage but is it reasonable to assume that the reactive investments that have been made will
[3985.58 --> 3990.46]  reshape the chip maker landscape and make the future brighter as a whole it's possible but the
[3990.46 --> 3996.06]  thing is that i don't think these investments are being made with the intention of driving prices down
[3996.70 --> 4006.06]  they're being made with um with a keen eye toward how much demand there will be once these fabs go online
[4006.70 --> 4010.06]  i don't think the intention is to over produce and drive down prices sorry
[4011.66 --> 4019.26]  uh yeah uh mike 11 says thanks linus finally catching a live show from new zealand wanted to
[4019.26 --> 4026.38]  say thanks for the videos hey thank you michael and uh john says did you know the woman who invented
[4026.38 --> 4030.86]  one of the foundational technologies for wi-fi also starred in one of the most famous erotic films of
[4030.86 --> 4039.10]  all time um no i can't say i did thanks aram uh palladian and zero two says hey guys i need some more
[4039.10 --> 4043.26]  ports on my router it only has four what do you recommend to add more that is such a simple tech
[4043.26 --> 4048.30]  tip how have we never done a video on that how to add more ports to your router uh buy yourself a network
[4048.30 --> 4054.86]  switch are you sure you haven't i'm sure i'm sure i have never done tech wiki or or or lance tech tips
[4054.86 --> 4059.42]  nope i have never done that like i just i just glossed right over that
[4059.42 --> 4073.98]  wow yeah how have i never done that to be fair these videos oh no tech with brett from eight months
[4073.98 --> 4080.38]  ago that is totally the kind of thing that people would search for and that i have never addressed
[4080.38 --> 4085.82]  so what you need to do is you need to buy a network switch so one of these is going to do you just nicely
[4085.82 --> 4090.22]  if you'll need a few more ports this netgear 5 port on managed switch will do just fine for 17
[4091.10 --> 4097.50]  you plug one of your ports um on your existing router into one of the ports on this little switch
[4097.50 --> 4104.06]  here and then you plug all your other devices into the rest of them they will share that uplink
[4104.06 --> 4111.98]  bandwidth so all those devices will now share the uh one gigabit probably um that the the one port on
[4111.98 --> 4118.38]  your upstream device is connected to it with but probably that is fine because they probably all
[4118.38 --> 4124.14]  won't be going full bore at the same time and what's nice is that if you have devices that are
[4124.14 --> 4129.42]  all connected to the little five port switch they can communicate with each other at full gigabit speed
[4129.42 --> 4135.02]  it's only if they have to cross over to devices on the other switch so as long as you lay things out
[4135.02 --> 4140.94]  in a way that's kind of sensible you can minimize the amount of traffic on that uh potential bottleneck to
[4140.94 --> 4149.18]  link potentially bottleneck linked and that's it it's the end of the wan show we will see you again next
[4149.18 --> 4164.78]  week same bad time same bad channel bye
[4170.94 --> 4171.74]  you
