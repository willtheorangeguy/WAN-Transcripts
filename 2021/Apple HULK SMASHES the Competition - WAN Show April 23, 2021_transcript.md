[0.00 --> 12.44]  what is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan show we've got a fantastic show for you guys
[12.44 --> 19.84]  today with obviously the big headline topic being apple's event this week they went and they i mean
[19.84 --> 26.36]  it's like their entire corporate strategy is put an m1 in it they went they put m1 chips in topic
[26.36 --> 33.42]  whoa what is that stop please ah terrible sorry about that they put an m1 in pretty much everything
[33.42 --> 40.74]  and we're gonna talk through what that means not just for their products but also for you know
[40.74 --> 46.48]  potentially the environment we did a little video this week on product repairability and right to
[46.48 --> 52.64]  repair and putting m1s and things definitely has an impact on that we're also going to talk about
[52.64 --> 58.14]  the no we're not going to talk about that ah yes the project xcloud beta that rolled out on ios
[58.14 --> 64.00]  and pc that makes project xcloud an even more compelling option than it was already for those
[64.00 --> 70.88]  of you out there who are still struggling to get a graphics card and what else we got luke
[70.88 --> 78.22]  we have some uh uh some non-news topics as well talking about how linus brought go-karts home for
[78.22 --> 82.12]  his kids which sounds amazing i'm gonna tell you all about them they're so cool you gotta come over
[82.12 --> 88.06]  and try them sometime anyway carry on and and uh that linus might be building a pc with a basketball
[88.06 --> 96.52]  star yes oh i am so excited to talk about that okay yeah we're gonna have a great show for you guys
[96.52 --> 98.26]  today and let's go ahead roll that intro
[98.26 --> 126.46]  and the show is brought to you today by private internet access ridge wallet and
[126.46 --> 134.52]  see sonic why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day and that is of course apple's fall
[134.52 --> 141.16]  420 event now i think that um what do you want to start with luke do you want to start with their
[141.16 --> 148.80]  tile competitor the air tags tracker or the apple refresh i i think the the tile competitor thing is
[148.80 --> 155.96]  almost it's its own topic entirely due to the uh the friction that they're having with uh what is the
[155.96 --> 161.64]  even other brand i never had tile yes the friction they're having with tile so maybe let's leave that
[161.64 --> 171.08]  off and do the the slew of m1 products all right so man this ipad pro now luke have you ever owned a
[171.08 --> 177.80]  tablet in your life no have you ever had any desire to own a tablet in your life nope okay stop looking
[177.80 --> 185.68]  at the specs stop looking at the specs close your eyes and imagine this okay it's a 12.9 inch display
[185.68 --> 192.74]  okay so this is a freaking this is a big tablet okay it's big enough for like real man hands
[192.74 --> 198.74]  all right okay it's got a type c port on the bottom but we already had that okay we already had
[198.74 --> 205.92]  that on the ipad pro but get this the type c port is freaking thunderbolt okay that's pretty sick okay
[205.92 --> 213.20]  so we've got a thunderbolt ipad okay now let me tell you about the cpu or rather the soc apple they
[213.20 --> 219.38]  went and they put the same m1 processor from their recent macbook pro and macbook air they went they
[219.38 --> 226.38]  threw it in an ipad and for all the jokes that we made about the new m1 macbooks being basically ipads
[226.38 --> 232.54]  with keyboards and without touch screens the m1 processor that is a very good thing going in this
[232.54 --> 237.02]  direction it's a very good thing going in both directions it was never meant to mean that ipad
[237.02 --> 244.38]  pros were not fast it was meant to mean that okay these devices are obviously converging here and it that
[244.38 --> 251.52]  has come to fruition we have an m1 equipped ipad pro now here's the kicker okay imagine this in a mobile
[251.52 --> 262.52]  device a thousand nit backlit screen 1600 nits peak brightness with 2500 local dimming zones okay you can
[262.52 --> 266.24]  open your eyes now you can open your eyes okay i don't actually fully understand why they were closed
[266.24 --> 268.96]  they were closed so you could imagine better okay
[268.96 --> 277.50]  i appreciated the experience regardless so this ipad which starts at
[277.50 --> 281.90]  sounds awesome start at like 900 or something like that can't remember the pricing doesn't matter
[281.90 --> 289.42]  the point is this ipad will be probably the fastest computing device in your household when it comes to
[289.42 --> 295.12]  single threaded or even lightly threaded tasks it will be it will have the fastest connectivity in your
[295.12 --> 301.52]  household with a 40 gigabit per second connection that you could use for i mean it runs ipad os so i
[301.52 --> 307.62]  wouldn't necessarily expect that you're going to be hooking up like your audio interface to it anytime
[307.62 --> 312.82]  soon but who knows what the future is going to hold at least the capabilities there now but you could
[312.82 --> 320.58]  definitely hook up something like a pro display xdr 6k external display with you know a usb hub for all
[320.58 --> 327.54]  your peripherals use the thing as a freaking you know ipad os freaking desktop and and get this
[327.54 --> 334.18]  it will probably be the best hdr content viewing experience in your household
[334.18 --> 341.84]  in the range of a thousand dollars so yes an ipad is an expensive device for a tablet which to me the
[341.84 --> 349.66]  utility is would you buy very limited i mean we're talking like what would you use a tablet for like
[349.66 --> 357.24]  watching porn in bed like it's the best device for that well it is come on i'm not gonna argue maybe
[357.24 --> 362.40]  not because vr headsets exist but oh come on it's up there you're not gonna have a vr headset in your
[362.40 --> 367.06]  oh i guess they've got the standalone ones okay that's fair i guarantee you people do i guarantee
[367.06 --> 372.36]  okay you know what i take your guarantee i will see your guarantee and raise you two guarantees
[372.36 --> 375.96]  i'm with you i'm with you on that i just mean
[375.96 --> 385.40]  okay yeah vr headset okay fine it's up there though i will give it that okay okay it's the best device for
[385.40 --> 392.64]  um um watching netflix on the couch while your so is watching something else on the tv
[392.64 --> 400.38]  and if you have the kind of disposable income that you can buy a device that is dedicated to that
[400.38 --> 409.60]  then the ipad has got you covered but but with these changes now it's so much more because okay you can't
[409.60 --> 414.94]  use the last gen magic keyboard but if you add a magic keyboard now all of a sudden it's a fold-out
[414.94 --> 420.36]  little laptop thing that also you can disconnect it's basically a convertible but with extra steps
[420.36 --> 427.00]  and that display a thousand nits full screen brightness luke this is real hdr
[427.00 --> 435.44]  yeah what why can't you use the previous keyboard i don't know because what's the possible limitation
[435.44 --> 442.36]  there like it's so ridiculous i mean it's like a little thicker so like i don't know maybe there's
[442.36 --> 446.66]  a physical compatibility that could possibly have been overcome by the billions and billions of
[446.66 --> 454.00]  dollars that apple spends on rnd of course yes that's possible oh that that that part just annoys me
[454.00 --> 459.52]  but maybe it is like yeah maybe there's some shape issues or something i don't know but yeah i mean
[459.52 --> 464.20]  we haven't been hands-on with it yet but okay so so now that now that we've talked through that this
[464.20 --> 473.52]  thing is barely even an ipad anymore could you possibly be compelled to use it to use it yes sure
[473.52 --> 482.98]  okay to pay almost anything for it no almost anything okay a hundred bucks
[482.98 --> 492.32]  probably not are you serious well if i could flip it a hundred guarantee that's not what i'm asking
[492.32 --> 497.32]  i'm gonna use it so like it's it's not the fact that it's a really good deal it doesn't matter
[497.32 --> 502.52]  because i don't think i would ever use it what about for gaming you don't have a single other ios device
[502.52 --> 508.60]  in hold on you bear with me now sir okay okay you don't have that game that you want to play you
[508.60 --> 516.74]  don't have a single other ios device in your house so why not for gaming like you could play compelling
[516.74 --> 523.72]  exclusives like fantasia and i don't know if they have any other ones i feel like pulling out a viva
[523.72 --> 528.20]  the dirt league just like keyboard slamming someone over the head and be like no one games on max
[528.20 --> 534.02]  like i i don't know i don't have no idea like what like no i'm i'm good i have i have plenty of
[534.02 --> 541.34]  devices in this house that i can play games on um and what what a terrible buying a tablet
[541.34 --> 546.78]  for gaming no but it has thunderbolt thousand dollars it has thunderbolt so you can connect it to anything
[546.78 --> 555.00]  but you're still running ipad os yeah but like yeah but what that's horrible okay hold on when's the
[555.00 --> 565.04]  last time you used ipad os it's been a long time okay okay didn't you have an ipad like quite a while
[565.04 --> 571.02]  ago at your house or something i still have an ipad too at my house yeah that was probably it that ipad
[571.02 --> 577.50]  was probably the last so ipad os has changed a lot it does support keyboard and mouse properly
[577.50 --> 583.14]  what do you play on it no no no no no i don't mean from like a gaming standpoint even i just mean
[583.14 --> 588.02]  you can just like use a keyboard and mouse on it so if you were just word processing doing whatever
[588.02 --> 595.36]  oh oh oh there you could use it for um uh i believe the update came ah shoot who are those guys
[595.36 --> 601.14]  that we worked with that have a um uh it's not parsec but it's another kind of similar thing but i'm
[601.14 --> 605.40]  pretty sure parsec probably has it working so you could stream games to your ipad if you're just
[605.40 --> 611.54]  like on the couch or whatever um so you could use it to a laptop yeah you could do that to a laptop
[611.54 --> 618.02]  yes which i have which you have already but your laptop doesn't have an hdr display on it with 1600
[618.02 --> 623.34]  nit peak brightness okay so you could hdr game not that any of those game streaming services support
[623.34 --> 630.54]  hdr yet anyway but at some point they might um escapement dog says and i but i mean as as marquez
[630.54 --> 636.52]  tweeted on twitter you don't buy things with pro for for software promises down the line so i would
[636.52 --> 642.18]  not get it for that reason uh escapement dog says an ipad is great for eating digital magazines
[642.18 --> 650.76]  no don't care i'm sorry escapement dog uh that was not gonna work you're a floatplane subscriber
[650.76 --> 657.94]  and so i'm not gonna be too rude to you because thank you very much but are you for real what what
[657.94 --> 667.82]  magazines what what do people read magazines what generation are you in but seriously thank you very
[667.82 --> 674.40]  much for yes appreciate it thanks for supporting um okay okay okay sky scan r says i have an ipad mini
[674.40 --> 678.92]  for my drone that is a great application for the mini we're not talking about the mini but hey cool
[678.92 --> 682.82]  that's great sure and you don't need any of the features or to spend anywhere near as much
[682.82 --> 690.42]  again though if it's at that 100 discounted price and i cared sure okay but i still i still don't
[690.42 --> 695.40]  j2vl says rainway rainway was the one i'm talking about where you could keyboard mouse game on an ipad
[695.40 --> 703.54]  streaming from your gaming pc uh apocalyptic on apocalyptic on three says linus puts way more value
[703.54 --> 709.10]  in hdr than i think the average person does the average person doesn't put a lot of value in hdr
[709.10 --> 715.98]  because the average person hasn't experienced hdr properly hdr is a big difference maker i mean luke
[715.98 --> 722.68]  now that you have an hdr tv would you go back well i mean i would but it's a fantastic feature i like it
[722.68 --> 732.06]  a lot um it's very noticeable when you're playing hdr content it is very nice and you can really tell
[732.06 --> 739.28]  when you're watching content on the tv that does have hdr yeah um do you remember when you got float
[739.28 --> 745.10]  plane to uh make it so that hdr content could could be played through the website do you remember that
[745.10 --> 750.90]  i do you remember when it was super urgent because you guys were going to totally pivot to
[750.90 --> 757.16]  everything being filmed and uploaded in hdr do you remember that well i remember i remember that you
[757.16 --> 762.12]  guys only uploaded one video in that format and it took like a lot of work i remember a thing like
[762.12 --> 766.04]  this happening i remember a thing like this happening i can't say that i remember when it
[766.04 --> 772.18]  happened because my memory doesn't go back that far it was quite a while ago do you know we're still
[772.18 --> 780.52]  supporting that uh yes so okay in fairness we are working on it um ed says okay that was actually a
[780.52 --> 784.76]  somewhat genuine question because yes i needed to know because we were wondering if because we're doing
[784.76 --> 791.18]  some upgrades we need to know bring it yeah so uh yes we're bringing it along for the ride ed is still
[791.18 --> 796.84]  working on the workflow for that so ultimately it's funny but what it comes down to is that floatplane
[796.84 --> 804.42]  is not getting hdr because adobe and youtube still haven't gotten together and figured out how to have
[804.42 --> 810.74]  premiere output all the metadata in a format that youtube can natively understand and accept got it
[810.74 --> 818.46]  okay so that is why sounds good i i uh yeah that that my friends is how you pivot wancho into a
[818.46 --> 824.64]  flowplane work meeting um okay great sorry do you have any more uh use cases land shark says i read the
[824.64 --> 831.32]  economist also reading books is nice on a tablet i you know i can't get into it i can't get into it for
[831.32 --> 836.80]  me the the galaxy fold was kind of a game changer for me because it was something that i had on me all
[836.80 --> 841.66]  the time like i actually read more when i was daily driving a fold speaking of which and also
[841.66 --> 848.86]  floatplane related um is jayden ever going to send back my fold z2 no yes zfold 2 or whatever they
[848.86 --> 852.52]  call the stupid thing i thought he sent that out already okay cool yeah if i can get that back that
[852.52 --> 857.98]  would be great thanks um so that was a game changer for me but i would never go get a tablet for that
[857.98 --> 861.84]  if i'm going to go get a device like i have to actually get up off my hiney i don't have it on me
[861.84 --> 867.44]  already i gotta go get one i'm gonna go get a kindle or something with an e-ink display i was
[867.44 --> 872.52]  gonna say right when you said i would way rather have an e-ink display by the way i saw a really
[872.52 --> 877.46]  cool project not that long ago i should have thrown this in the dock actually but yeah um i think it was
[877.46 --> 884.02]  a few weeks back i saw a really cool project where someone made uh a very large like almost i think it
[884.02 --> 890.92]  was like a monitor sized e-ink just he didn't make this um he worked he developed on top of it but
[890.92 --> 896.22]  he bought this very large like monitor size e-ink display vertical mounted on the wall and then had
[896.22 --> 900.86]  it grab random newspapers from his area and display them and it looked like super cool and i thought
[900.86 --> 904.72]  there'd be some other cool things just because you don't read newspapers that you could do with it
[904.72 --> 911.40]  um e-ink displays are freaking awesome yeah they're super cool and it's kind of unfortunate that tech
[911.40 --> 918.20]  hasn't really been going further than e-readers this is great this is from rod uh from bs mods uh give
[918.20 --> 924.58]  luke a hundred bucks what would he be more likely to buy an ipad pro or a tube tv for retro games
[924.58 --> 932.80]  oh yeah tube tv for retro games it depends if it's good though you get it you get a killer deal you find
[932.80 --> 937.76]  a good one yeah yeah neither of those is happening at a hundred dollars if we're being realistic like
[937.76 --> 943.28]  crappy tube tvs you can get them for free if you're willing to haul them away but the good ones are
[943.28 --> 948.66]  actually starting to become like honestly if i had acquired them when they were worth nothing
[948.66 --> 954.26]  five eight ten years ago and i just stored them in a warehouse warehouse till now that's probably one
[954.26 --> 959.82]  of the best investments that i could have made like yeah those things are going for crazy amounts of
[959.82 --> 964.66]  money now yeah you know the operative thing that rod said though was give luke a hundred dollars and he
[964.66 --> 968.38]  has to buy one of these two things because i wouldn't buy either of them with my own hundred dollars
[968.38 --> 975.30]  yeah i get it um courageous potato says it is an unmatched pencil experience besides a wacom tablet
[975.30 --> 981.22]  yep that's fair if you are actually into sketching and whatnot there is a lot you can do as an artist
[981.22 --> 987.78]  with an ipad so you want to have like a mobile photography workstation absolutely crazy amazing
[987.78 --> 994.52]  device i'm super into it i think it's a compelling value now let's talk about the m1 equipped imax that
[994.52 --> 1000.50]  come in six different colors that happen to be the six colors of the original apple logo apparently
[1000.50 --> 1008.26]  so um yeah smaller bezels have you seen these have you have you seen this i have yes okay smaller
[1008.26 --> 1015.04]  bezels let's talk about the external power brick this is the first to my knowledge this is the first
[1015.04 --> 1023.00]  apple desktop machine to ever have an external power brick even the trash can the tiny little trash can
[1023.00 --> 1031.08]  had an internal power supply did it not uh am i mistaken thought it did no i thought it did um i can
[1031.08 --> 1039.00]  look it up though but i thought it did i'm pretty still apparently the g4 cube the g4 cube oh
[1039.00 --> 1048.72]  okay all right so that's fair yep there are some old ones but like why so there's a couple it feels
[1048.72 --> 1055.00]  honestly uh despite your your evidence that you've you've pointed out um that very very few have ever
[1055.00 --> 1060.18]  had an external power brick for some reason to me it feels very apple to do that if they could make
[1060.18 --> 1067.66]  the design of the device itself like sleeker i could totally if for some reason it clicks in my brain that
[1067.66 --> 1074.90]  they would absolutely have an external power brick so then my next question is why does it need a magnetic
[1074.90 --> 1081.92]  cable on a desktop we're not talking something that you've got at you know in the starbucks or
[1081.92 --> 1087.04]  whatever and someone might trip over it because to me that was one of the big selling points of magsafe
[1087.04 --> 1092.90]  it wasn't that i'm too much of a smooth brain chimp to plug in a barrel connector it was just that
[1092.90 --> 1098.98]  if someone else is too much of a smooth brain chimp to foot flick when they accidentally hit my cable
[1098.98 --> 1103.98]  and you know the foot flick luke luke's the one who coined the name for it but where your foot like
[1103.98 --> 1108.82]  hits the cable and you flick up so that you don't actually actually you know drag whatever it is off
[1108.82 --> 1113.40]  the table so if someone is dumb enough that they drag my laptop off the table to me that was like
[1113.40 --> 1121.24]  a killer feature that could save you two grand like the first time you go and use it on a desktop
[1121.24 --> 1128.32]  op1 says literally all macbooks have external power bricks yes but we said desktop max
[1128.32 --> 1137.58]  like help help me out here yeah i i mean okay so one counter that i'll bring up with is is why not
[1137.58 --> 1145.66]  um i mean they're charging a lot for it so you might as well get some like cool neato features
[1145.66 --> 1150.82]  and like maybe you're you're cleaning under your desk and you like yoink the cable it's probably
[1150.82 --> 1158.18]  very light and thus very easily accidentally manipulated yeah um so i'd rat like if i'm sure it
[1158.18 --> 1163.42]  weighs more than just my non-computer monitor that's in front or it probably weighs sorry i'm
[1163.42 --> 1168.04]  sure it weighs less than my non-computer monitor that's in front of me yeah um really so if you
[1168.04 --> 1172.44]  if you yank on the cable i wouldn't want that really expensive device just whack into the wall
[1172.44 --> 1176.40]  i guess there's also a thinness factor where are you going to put it like i've seen external displays
[1176.40 --> 1181.20]  that are that thin but you plug in from the side and there's no way that was going to fly with apple
[1181.20 --> 1186.64]  still i mean there's there's a hundred other ways that you could connect something it doesn't have
[1186.64 --> 1192.06]  to be magnetic you could have it go on and like kind of screw on to a thing or like you could yeah
[1192.06 --> 1197.18]  like i mean there's a thousand different ways to connect a thing to a thing wasn't it xbox or
[1197.18 --> 1201.36]  microsoft that started the the like breakaway controller design i always thought that was really
[1201.36 --> 1207.68]  smart uh i think oh yeah with the xbox i mean i'm sure that they didn't invent it but yeah that's
[1207.68 --> 1213.44]  probably one of the more famous mainstream implementations of a breakaway cable yeah so
[1213.44 --> 1218.22]  they could have done something like that um yeah i mean i'm not against it because why not i i i when
[1218.22 --> 1222.42]  i heard that it had that feature i was like oh okay like it's it's cool it's not it's not gonna
[1222.42 --> 1228.54]  sell the device for me but now let's talk about the bigger problem okay a lot of people are upset
[1228.54 --> 1233.44]  about the chin bar i get it people are upset about the chin bar because what modern monitor has a
[1233.44 --> 1239.86]  chin bar why and okay yeah that's a good point it's a thing to be upset about because it's so
[1239.86 --> 1244.54]  unnecessary in the interest of making it as thin as possible from the side where you will quite
[1244.54 --> 1249.96]  literally never see it apple went and put a big ugly chin in front of you where you will see it all day
[1249.96 --> 1257.58]  every day and all for what to save you like this much space on your desk like that's that's a funny
[1257.58 --> 1263.46]  thing when we went from crts to flat screen displays excuse me flat panel displays because
[1263.46 --> 1268.92]  a flat screen display is a crt with a flat piece of glass on the front that is an important distinction
[1268.92 --> 1275.16]  so when we went from crts to flat panel displays all of a sudden there was a significant like desk
[1275.16 --> 1281.14]  savings you know you could your setup was so much cleaner all of a sudden and motion on your screen
[1281.14 --> 1287.40]  was smeary and horrible but boy did you ever get a cleaner desk setup here i i don't see the difference
[1287.40 --> 1294.86]  between this and this and i feel like apple is kind of coming at this trend really late like for
[1294.86 --> 1300.16]  years and years tv manufacturers kept chasing thinner and thinner oh we made it a millimeter
[1300.16 --> 1306.00]  thinner we made it a millimeter thinner lg went as far as to make a wallpaper tv and then i don't know
[1306.00 --> 1312.76]  if you guys noticed but that whole thing has kind of gone away like there are thin tvs but nobody's
[1312.76 --> 1317.38]  talking about it anymore it's not like when you go to ces they're like it's 30 thinner
[1317.38 --> 1322.94]  because they figured out that beyond a certain point i'd say beyond like it doesn't really matter
[1322.94 --> 1330.32]  anymore thick nobody cares because it does not make an appreciable difference to how you enjoy the
[1330.32 --> 1336.10]  product so i can see why people are upset about that element of the chin bar because they could
[1336.10 --> 1340.38]  have just made it thicker they could have hucked everything on the back of it honestly the one that
[1340.38 --> 1348.24]  i'm way more upset about is the lack of ethernet it doesn't have ethernet on board that's actually
[1348.24 --> 1354.58]  super bonkers yeah like yep how mind-blowing is that to you and like it's not like i don't talk to
[1354.58 --> 1362.14]  people where i go you know hey are you you know your your connection's kind of bad are you on wi-fi
[1362.14 --> 1370.74]  and they'll say yeah i'm on wi-fi and i'll say can you go get a wire because even the best wi-fi
[1370.74 --> 1376.32]  is not as good as the worst okay i shouldn't say that yeah and i yeah there is some really good
[1376.32 --> 1381.98]  wireless solutions but like i i'd also say like it's it's just kind of weird because so many like
[1381.98 --> 1388.40]  you're talking about calls right and especially in in the current pandemic state so many calls are
[1388.40 --> 1396.68]  happening from home devices and these m1 max look like home devices um so to not have that wire
[1396.68 --> 1404.38]  connection in it's whether it's video calls normal calls or streaming um because as much as a lot of
[1404.38 --> 1409.74]  streaming started with just games there's tons of artist streamers and and yeah like non-gaming
[1409.74 --> 1415.44]  streamers out there now uh so to have that limitation just feels super weird i there's there's a way to
[1415.44 --> 1420.14]  get like a dock or something that comes with it right it comes with the higher end one so the power
[1420.14 --> 1426.84]  brick actually has an ethernet jack in it which is kind of an ingenious solution to not having to plug
[1426.84 --> 1435.50]  yet another wire into the back of the machine but it bothers me a lot that people are going to buy the
[1435.50 --> 1444.58]  lower end model not have an ethernet jack at all and then i their nephew or grandson or whatever
[1444.58 --> 1450.54]  are going to go over to their house they're going to complain that the internet doesn't work or their
[1450.54 --> 1459.20]  phone calls are are bad or whatever and then i'm going to have to go and go buy like a usb ethernet
[1459.20 --> 1464.00]  dongle to hang off the back because it's going to be so much cheaper than buying a replacement power
[1464.00 --> 1471.58]  brick oh yeah definitely it's just really it's just really frustrating because i know for a fact
[1471.58 --> 1480.18]  that the cost of like an ethernet controller is literally like between a dollar and two dollars
[1480.18 --> 1489.32]  it's actually negligible in the context of you know a 700 800 900 thousand dollar product
[1489.32 --> 1500.42]  so can we just can we not you know can we not save that dollar can we just provide it with everyone
[1500.42 --> 1508.12]  it not everything has to be wireless and in fact the fewer items are what that are wireless in your
[1508.12 --> 1514.44]  house or in your office the better those wireless things will perform so if you plug in every single
[1514.44 --> 1521.00]  desktop your laptops and phones and tablets are all going to deliver a better user experience
[1521.00 --> 1528.84]  so kind of whack i i'm i'm interested i've been trying to look it up but this this power connector
[1528.84 --> 1535.40]  that that includes ethernet i wonder how they're doing that i found i found a picture that that shows
[1535.40 --> 1540.22]  the the wall side where there's like the ethernet jack and the power to the wall but i can't see
[1540.22 --> 1544.86]  anything on the other end is it it's it's just a single cable that does power and ethernet i would
[1544.86 --> 1550.18]  guess that it's just some kind of usb power delivery that they're using for the device itself
[1550.18 --> 1554.50]  so then it's no surprise that it would have data channels in it as well that would be my god that
[1554.50 --> 1558.76]  makes sense i'm guessing right now though i haven't seen the actual connector so we'd have to have a look
[1558.76 --> 1567.66]  at it yeah that's interesting okay um anyway you know what i think honestly it's white bezels and
[1567.66 --> 1572.40]  chin bar aside i think people are going to get used to that it's going to be like the notch where
[1572.40 --> 1578.50]  it starts out where people are angry and then it becomes iconic or something and these things are
[1578.50 --> 1583.50]  going to sell like absolute hotcakes because what apple has managed to do with the m1 and we talked
[1583.50 --> 1589.06]  about this in our macbook air and in our uh macbook or do they call it the air i can't remember if it's
[1589.06 --> 1595.16]  error pro or error or non anything just macbook uh but in the macbook pro that also has the m1 processor
[1595.16 --> 1599.70]  we talked about this in our reviews what apple has managed to do with the m1 processor is nothing
[1599.70 --> 1604.74]  short of amazing they have delivered better performance at a lower price i mean that's
[1604.74 --> 1610.44]  something that apple hasn't seemed to care at all about in a very long time it's always been yeah
[1610.44 --> 1614.30]  better performance but hey it comes at a higher price like if you look at the introductory prices
[1614.30 --> 1622.28]  of basically every iphone it always goes up right like the original iphone yeah for sure what was the
[1622.28 --> 1627.30]  msrp of that thing uh let me look it up it's like four or five hundred bucks for the cheapest one
[1627.30 --> 1636.64]  they have literally doubled in price since 2007 my problem with the m1 is that if apple doesn't
[1637.36 --> 1642.88]  kind of surprise me here or not with the m1 yeah there's nothing they can do to surprise me but my
[1642.88 --> 1648.92]  problem with apple silicon with their m series processors is that there's absolutely nothing that
[1648.92 --> 1655.86]  you can do to upgrade or change it after the fact and do you remember when apple was cool
[1655.86 --> 1662.62]  and they allowed you to use your iMac as an external display for another computer do you remember that
[1662.62 --> 1667.02]  that was awesome actually and me and these i think i know the direction you're going in these would
[1667.02 --> 1676.00]  look kind of cool as displays sure and whether they look cool or not just keeping it out of the landfill
[1676.00 --> 1685.02]  once the computer is too slow having it have any purpose whatsoever beyond just being your computer
[1685.02 --> 1690.56]  i mean honestly just this is a totally shallow thing but even just having the ability to have two
[1690.56 --> 1696.26]  matching monitors on your desk today if you just buy two of them and use one of them as a monitor
[1696.26 --> 1702.94]  whatever your reason for it is that was a really cool feature and i will be really disappointed if it
[1702.94 --> 1708.98]  doesn't turn out to be a hidden feature of this one because as it is if anything goes wrong with
[1708.98 --> 1716.36]  this thing it is basically headed to the wood chipper and yeah you can recycle certain elements
[1716.36 --> 1725.08]  of it but recycling is not the best solution extending the life of it past just its initial usefulness as
[1725.08 --> 1732.42]  an all-in-one computer is by far a better solution than recycling it so i hope that turns out to be a
[1732.42 --> 1739.00]  thing but honestly i don't have a lot of hope for it um maybe maybe someone who knows something that i
[1739.00 --> 1744.92]  don't can let me know in the float plane chat cj strong says if it weren't for the silicon shortage
[1744.92 --> 1749.94]  do you think the iMac would have a new m2 processor no there's no way i mean with the with the lead time
[1749.94 --> 1756.82]  on a project like this yeah this product has been in development since at least like 24 months ago
[1756.82 --> 1762.10]  don't kid yourself so we didn't even know there was going to be a silicon shortage by the time they
[1762.10 --> 1770.82]  were sitting down to work on the 24 or 23 point whatever inch iMac um and honestly apple so far
[1770.82 --> 1778.04]  hasn't really been meaningfully impacted by the silicon shortage because apple does just an outstanding
[1778.04 --> 1784.20]  job of managing their supply chain i mean at the end of the day you can you can think apple is a
[1784.20 --> 1789.92]  luxury brand or you can think they're a consumer electronics brand or a technology brand or a
[1789.92 --> 1797.24]  services brand you know got your apple tv and all that kind of stuff their iCloud what apple is first and
[1797.24 --> 1805.50]  foremost is a supply chain company because they do it like pretty much nobody does it i mean when's the
[1805.50 --> 1814.20]  last time you wanted to buy an apple something and you couldn't do it maybe maybe for the first
[1814.20 --> 1819.36]  couple of weeks after the launch of a really hot product like i think the airpods were kind of hard
[1819.36 --> 1825.28]  to get your hands on for the first couple of weeks but they recover like you were kind of saying they
[1825.28 --> 1830.96]  recover a lot faster than a lot of other companies do too like the switch or the wii and like nintendo
[1830.96 --> 1837.20]  theoretically must have a pretty good set a little bit of experience you'd think yeah but but like
[1837.20 --> 1844.54]  both the nintendo wii and the nintendo switch were both horrible like almost impossible to buy for
[1844.54 --> 1848.14]  very extended periods of time and then i mean the switch had been out for a while and then it was
[1848.14 --> 1853.50]  almost impossible to buy again for a very significant amount of time what was the uh yeah we we fit
[1853.50 --> 1863.28]  was practically impossible to buy for like six or seven months in the pandemic 100 wow 100 all right
[1863.28 --> 1870.42]  uh we should announce uh something pretty special soon and i guess we're gonna do it right now yes
[1870.42 --> 1876.54]  ladies and gentlemen hold on one sec hold on oh i'm getting a call from the president give me a moment
[1876.54 --> 1884.64]  hello president oh uh you're we can hear you you know that right okay yeah yeah he moved away from
[1884.64 --> 1889.62]  the mic okay all right i got a big surprise for y'all and by the time you're watching this in the
[1889.62 --> 1898.70]  archive it will definitely be too late all right okay okay okay uh was the president just calling to tell
[1898.70 --> 1904.24]  me to do this uh yes we are we are we are not going to war everything is okay that's good all right
[1904.24 --> 1911.80]  attention verified actual gamers you're not verified yet but if you're actual gamers there's a chance
[1911.80 --> 1920.26]  that in the next short while you will become verified we have a small wanshow exclusive drop
[1920.26 --> 1927.70]  of asus tough gaming amd radeon rx 6800 x toc edition graphics cards and we are going to have these
[1927.70 --> 1933.98]  at msrp now please do note msrp on this card has gone up a fair bit since it launched
[1933.98 --> 1941.16]  due to uh supply shortages as well as component price increases but this is still a lot less than
[1941.16 --> 1948.72]  what it would be on ebay from a scalper monster who's who's extorting you so this is a freaking
[1948.72 --> 1954.84]  sick gpu ladies and gentlemen runs it over two gigahertz has 16 gigs of gddr6 memory 4608 stream
[1954.84 --> 1962.24]  processors a triple fan 2.9 slot heatsink it's a thick boy it's a thick boy and features asus's
[1962.24 --> 1969.30]  axial tech fans with a zero decibel mode and their aura rgb lighting it's got a vented backplate and
[1969.30 --> 1975.52]  i want to thank before i tell you guys any more i want to thank amd and asus for supporting the
[1975.52 --> 1982.96]  verified actual gamer program where i promise them i promise you every single card we've even had
[1982.96 --> 1987.70]  people cancel orders and all we've done with them we've held on to them until we get a chance to put
[1987.70 --> 1993.56]  it in the hands of a verified actual gamer no one at no one at ltt no one on my staff no one who knows
[1993.56 --> 1999.02]  me in person can get their hands on it this is only people in the community i've had people on staff try
[1999.02 --> 2003.98]  to buy them they're like there are many flow plane members that want to get them can one go missing
[2003.98 --> 2012.18]  the answer is no you must pass the gamer gauntlet you must do it first they do 144 hour validation on
[2012.18 --> 2016.40]  these things for reliability out of the box which is good because if it dies the odds of you getting
[2016.40 --> 2023.12]  another one pretty slim so here it is ladies and gentlemen you can go challenge the gamer gauntlet now
[2023.12 --> 2032.46]  lttstore.com slash the brand of the chip okay so who is it that actually makes the chip on this
[2032.46 --> 2040.70]  graphics card three letters all right lttstore.com slash the brand of the chip the three letter name of
[2040.70 --> 2048.84]  this show the format that you are watching so the hint is that it is not vod okay it's not video on
[2048.84 --> 2054.52]  demand how you watching right now ladies and gentlemen it's a four letter word and the number of the month
[2054.52 --> 2064.04]  we are currently in lttstore.com slash the company that makes that radion chip three letters the show you
[2064.04 --> 2070.60]  are watching right now three letters the format you are watching in right now four letters and the number
[2070.60 --> 2077.44]  of the month that you are watching it in one number just in case that was just in case i was unclear
[2077.44 --> 2084.86]  not spelled out just great good luck gamers in the meantime let's blow through the apple tv 4k refresh
[2084.86 --> 2091.26]  it's got the a12 bionic chip uh it's got 4k 60 hdr playback this is really cool this is a really neat
[2091.26 --> 2098.06]  feature so with the apple tv 4k you can actually use your iphone point it at your screen and it will
[2098.06 --> 2104.80]  automatically calibrate its output based on the idiosyncrasies of your tv with the camera of your
[2104.80 --> 2111.26]  iphone that's pretty cool right that's actually kind of sick yeah unfortunately because apple is apple
[2111.26 --> 2118.32]  and didn't you know think to have it actually interface with the uh the menu of your tv it won't work for
[2118.32 --> 2125.32]  any other devices that are hooked up to your tv but it will work with your uh with your apple tv so at least
[2125.32 --> 2129.52]  that'll be color accurate so that's that's cool it's better than nothing for when you play fantasia
[2129.52 --> 2133.22]  which i still haven't played because i kind of want to play it on a different platform so i'm playing
[2133.22 --> 2138.92]  break the default instead now um comes with a new aluminum remote unfortunately doesn't contain the
[2138.92 --> 2143.48]  u1 chip so that you can find it like air tags which is unfortunate that seems like a missed opportunity
[2143.48 --> 2149.02]  yeah and the remote won't work with some games if anyone cares about that also there's a purple iphone
[2149.02 --> 2157.78]  all right do you want to talk about the tile thing uh the tile thing is interesting uh people are mad and
[2157.78 --> 2164.26]  when americans are mad they use lawyers so there's lawyers involved um tile seeks to reinforce ongoing
[2164.26 --> 2172.18]  antitrust charges against apple and the air tags release um and this may help their cause tile sees air
[2172.18 --> 2181.10]  tags as a copycat product i can understand why no that seeks to squeeze tile out of the ios ecosystem
[2181.10 --> 2188.50]  honestly when i saw the first screenshot of the air tag i thought it was a tile um apple recently opened
[2188.50 --> 2195.68]  the find my network uh system to third parties in order to head off anti-competitive complaints uh
[2195.68 --> 2202.16]  that probably isn't going to solve things though considering these notes that are following uh the
[2202.16 --> 2208.56]  tile took exception to what they call very strict terms and conditions likening it to a hostage program
[2208.56 --> 2215.92]  wow i'm surprised i'm super surprised after dealing with uh the the apple app store i'm very surprised that
[2215.92 --> 2220.86]  someone would think of it as a hostage program because that's exactly what it is uh this is referring to
[2220.86 --> 2227.74]  the fact that third parties cannot use their own apps to control find my find my functionality uh
[2227.74 --> 2234.62]  which is notably not how home kit works additionally apple hasn't fully opened you moved you want ultra
[2234.62 --> 2239.76]  wideband support to third parties making it impossible to compete with apple devices like air
[2239.76 --> 2247.02]  tags very cool not surprised um also crucially tile has already announced an ultra wideband tracker in
[2247.02 --> 2254.78]  january but has been unable to bring it to market thanks to uwb restrictions um apple's responses are
[2254.78 --> 2260.62]  basically like oh no this is totally fine we did some of this stuff before you did and you have 90 of
[2260.62 --> 2266.22]  the uh the market share anyways so it doesn't matter we've always embraced competition as the best way
[2266.22 --> 2272.14]  to drive great experiences for our customers yeah that's just another way of saying go yourself we don't
[2272.14 --> 2279.66]  care yeah yeah pretty much yeah i mean there is another consideration if apple opened up you want
[2279.66 --> 2285.58]  access to third parties without any kind of validation there's a lot of potential privacy issues
[2285.58 --> 2291.98]  like google also has a uwb api in android that is similarly unavailable to third-party apps so
[2292.78 --> 2301.02]  as for who's right about this um i mean i don't know it gets into some muddy legal waters that i don't
[2301.02 --> 2306.62]  understand it's a funny thing because on the one hand like let's say that um you know youtube uh
[2306.62 --> 2312.78]  entered implemented some kind of policy or some kind of business change that made it difficult for
[2312.78 --> 2319.90]  linus media group to operate the reality of it is we built our business on someone else's platform
[2320.86 --> 2328.86]  so now we suffer the consequences of that and it's not i'm not saying tile did something wrong i mean
[2328.86 --> 2335.34]  that was supposed to be what was so great about the iphone was that it was this platform where
[2335.34 --> 2342.62]  whether you made uh you know a flashlight app or a level app or uh whatever whatever app
[2343.18 --> 2349.18]  there was supposed to be money to be made in this ecosystem but then you know obviously if you're
[2349.18 --> 2353.98]  apple kind of like amazon does with amazon basics on basics yeah if you see something on your platform
[2353.98 --> 2358.94]  that's performing really well that you think you could throw a small you know engineering team at
[2358.94 --> 2364.78]  and whip up in a year or two and then just take all the revenue for yourself why wouldn't you do it
[2365.34 --> 2373.50]  because maybe you don't want to be a big but i guess you do so that comes the brakes right i yeah i don't know
[2373.50 --> 2382.54]  how the law works here it seems like kind of a jerk move um but i but that's what antitrust law is
[2382.54 --> 2390.94]  supposed to prevent it's supposed to prevent unfair competition so if you if you on the if on the basis
[2390.94 --> 2401.02]  of a of the idea being that this is a platform that um developers and product makers can can come
[2401.02 --> 2406.86]  and participate in and compete in if that's the idea and then you come in and you have a first party
[2406.86 --> 2413.74]  competitor that has advantages that you don't give to anyone else that's supposed to be what antitrust
[2413.74 --> 2419.90]  law is supposed to address and maybe it's this is just my paranoia but i just i don't i don't trust it
[2419.90 --> 2425.58]  you know like that's why we built floatplane that's why we built a forum because i had no guarantee
[2426.14 --> 2434.14]  that google couldn't just turn me off at some point and that's a big part of why we do our everything uh
[2434.14 --> 2440.78]  all our merch all our drops on lttstore.com it's not like amazon isn't an enormous marketplace that
[2440.78 --> 2445.74]  we could absolutely use when i called out that abcs of gaming is on amazon i think that was last week on
[2445.74 --> 2453.58]  wanshow we sold all 150 copies that we had in stock so fast that amazon's recommended restock for us
[2453.58 --> 2456.86]  was more than we were allowed to restock
[2459.50 --> 2467.66]  so this is great nick sent me the best message earlier uh here hold on a second let's see if i can
[2467.66 --> 2471.58]  while you're doing that i'll just say like i have no idea where the law lands on this or anything like
[2471.58 --> 2478.30]  that all i would say is that i hope if this does go through and they go after and and and like apple takes
[2478.30 --> 2485.02]  takes takes a blow for this i hope they look at amazon um i hope whoever whatever lawyers they had
[2485.02 --> 2491.26]  behind this take a look at amazon because holy crap they've been doing the exact same thing um and just
[2491.26 --> 2499.42]  as bad or worse for years so yep it's some serious scumbaggery and i'm really not that into it now uh this
[2499.42 --> 2506.30]  is really cool i've actually got the message that nick sent me for you guys here uh can you can you see
[2506.30 --> 2515.66]  this luke so it says recommended quantity 828 and then it says we put in 828 and it goes this product
[2515.66 --> 2520.38]  exceeds the allowed quantity for standard size storage click the restock limits monitor to view
[2520.38 --> 2526.06]  the maximum shipment quantity for the standard size storage it's like you literally you told me
[2526.86 --> 2535.10]  to get this many of them but when it's a new item amazon only allows so many so they asked us to do
[2535.10 --> 2542.06]  what we couldn't do because they told us we couldn't do it it's like okay sure so it seems
[2542.06 --> 2547.26]  like a pretty simple thing to to fix and that's weird as long as you're reliant on somebody else's
[2547.26 --> 2551.02]  platform that's always going to be the way that it is you want to do something like verified actual
[2551.02 --> 2554.86]  gamer program there's no way we could build that through amazon that's something that we were only
[2554.86 --> 2560.70]  able to do with the help of the float plane team and by integrating it into a separate platform like
[2560.70 --> 2566.30]  shopify where we actually have at least some degree of control and it's not perfect to be very clear
[2566.30 --> 2572.94]  like developing for shopify there's a reason that you know it's kind of considered to be half science
[2572.94 --> 2578.86]  half a little bit of black magic um what's up luke uh just yeah
[2578.86 --> 2582.86]  yeah
[2583.98 --> 2590.30]  but at least it's better than being entirely dependent on someone else's you know black box
[2590.30 --> 2597.18]  you know what i mean yeah at least they do let you do things like you it yeah all right so thank you
[2597.18 --> 2602.94]  verified gamers i'm actually just looking at my shopify dashboard right now and i think that's probably
[2602.94 --> 2610.54]  probably probably everyone who managed to validate right away has checked out but i do have good
[2610.54 --> 2619.50]  news for you guys if you didn't get one we will have an accompanying drop coming up with the other 270
[2619.50 --> 2625.74]  of those cards there's going to be more we knew they have not all sold oh they haven't well okay but
[2625.74 --> 2632.62]  if you're not already queued there's no way um but we knew that this one was going to be a total mad
[2632.62 --> 2637.50]  rush and that's the reason that we haven't typically done them live on wanshow because we know you guys
[2637.50 --> 2644.22]  are dialed in all we have to do is mention you know an available domain name and within seconds it's been
[2644.22 --> 2651.26]  snapped up and redirected to ltcstore.com so like we know you guys are on it which is why we only did 30.
[2651.26 --> 2657.34]  we didn't want to just we didn't want to just have them all go to the wanshow audience sorry we have
[2657.34 --> 2662.78]  lots and lots of actual gamers out there who don't necessarily tune into wanshow so we want to make sure
[2662.78 --> 2667.58]  that they get a crack at it spread the love yeah metal gap he says to everyone that got a card
[2667.58 --> 2674.30]  congratulations and i hope you enjoy them thank you metal gap he that is exactly what we're trying to do here
[2675.58 --> 2680.94]  all right um skhs says only 30 that's right it was only 30.
[2680.94 --> 2688.06]  i told you guys very small drop for this one but the other 270 are coming so stay tuned not not on
[2688.06 --> 2695.66]  wanshow today all right why don't we uh what is going on what is happening to my wait did i open
[2695.66 --> 2703.74]  the wrong oh i opened the wrong browser window so i was like all my tabs were like kind of right but um
[2703.74 --> 2709.34]  sometimes when i restart or if chrome crashes or whatever you know how you can open up your previous
[2709.34 --> 2714.94]  20 tabs or whatever yeah sometimes it'll like do it twice for whatever reason so i'll have two
[2714.94 --> 2721.66]  almost identical chrome windows oh weird and so this one i the one i'm using right now i had like
[2721.66 --> 2727.58]  you know gone to the wanshow document in my google docs tab and i had gone to the floatplane chat
[2727.58 --> 2732.46]  dashboard and my floatplane tab and all that kind of stuff and i accidentally pulled up the wrong one
[2732.46 --> 2736.70]  when i moved it out of the way so that i could show everyone that message from nick and i pulled up the
[2736.70 --> 2741.02]  old one i was like all these tabs are right but i'm just what's going on yeah i'm in the wrong i'm
[2741.02 --> 2747.58]  in the wrong pages what's going on here uh in other news oh our sponsors right the show is brought to

[2847.66 --> 2854.06]  the highest it goes uh lambda noise level a plus plus their talking points are hilarious basically
[2854.06 --> 2860.14]  means your noise output stays below 20 decibels during operation so it's functionally silent um they
[2860.14 --> 2865.90]  feature fluid dynamic fan bearings in some of their higher end models with their premium hybrid fan control
[2865.90 --> 2870.70]  so you can actually turn the fan off when it's under low load um they've got what they call micro
[2870.70 --> 2876.30]  tolerance load regulations basically just means that when there's a sudden surge in demand you're not
[2876.30 --> 2882.38]  going to have your uh your voltages dip and stuff like that and they offer a 12-year warranty on their
[2882.38 --> 2889.74]  top tier models so check them out at see sonic.com or on amazon at the link down below they should change
[2889.74 --> 2896.46]  their tagline to that which one say sonic we're just good people oh yeah yeah exactly we're just all
[2896.46 --> 2903.98]  right i mean they might not all be good maybe some of them are total crap heads uh so these are super cool
[2905.18 --> 2906.86]  guess who makes go-karts
[2910.70 --> 2917.74]  i don't have a single clue okay nine bot nine bot nine bot makes a go-kart
[2917.74 --> 2926.70]  go-kart this is the nine bot go-kart pro and oh segway yeah they bought segway so
[2928.46 --> 2938.94]  it is a drift monster and we got four of them it's got like these super kind of slick back tires
[2938.94 --> 2946.54]  and then like grippier front ones uh it's actually powered by a the rear wheel rear wheel drive
[2946.54 --> 2950.54]  uh four different modes so it'll do up to 23 miles an hour in race mode
[2951.18 --> 2956.78]  and uh what was the other aerodynamic rear wing okay that's not much of a feature and then it actually
[2956.78 --> 2964.46]  converts into where is it you can pull out the drive unit at the back and it converts into what is it
[2964.46 --> 2977.26]  called like an s s uh yeah i think it's nine bot s yeah one of these things it's crazy this thing is crazy
[2977.98 --> 2986.54]  so i brought it home uh for my kids to try and okay to be clear i don't recommend this this will not be in the email
[2986.54 --> 2995.18]  um in the email or in the email in the video about it but this is so funny okay so this is me uh ripping
[2995.18 --> 3002.06]  down our street with my daughter in my lap oh a second why is my uh why is my auto rotate not on
[3002.06 --> 3006.06]  because i'm some kind of monster i guess hold on okay see if you guys can hear this
[3006.06 --> 3014.78]  why is this wow wow that's wow why is this is awesome why does it not default to have audio i freaking
[3016.06 --> 3020.14]  i kind of hate this thing okay so we're ripping
[3023.18 --> 3024.78]  is it uh is it lagging
[3024.78 --> 3040.78]  man the expression on her face when we were just like ripping down the street man there's not many
[3040.78 --> 3050.46]  sounds that are more pure joy than a little kid going fast and probably the cutest thing about it
[3050.46 --> 3055.66]  was at each speed i would take her and she'd be like go as fast as we can we'd go we'd rip down in
[3055.66 --> 3063.82]  a straight line and then um i'd get back and i'd be like can i tell you a secret and she goes yeah and i go
[3064.46 --> 3071.90]  it goes faster and she's like ha ha ha and she'll laugh can we do it i'm like okay and then we'd go we'd rip
[3071.90 --> 3079.18]  and it'd be like was that fun she'd be like yeah and i'd be like let me tell you a secret okay it goes faster
[3080.46 --> 3088.14]  and she just laughed like that so funny man little kids man it's uh i'm not gonna try and sell you
[3088.14 --> 3093.42]  on it because i know you got you know you got your thing you got your thing but it's it's i'm into it
[3093.42 --> 3102.22]  hold on this is i think i think i have one of those here oh why is the sound off i hate you so much okay
[3102.22 --> 3112.54]  okay oh nope never mind i think uh i think we didn't catch that anyway it was it was super funny
[3113.34 --> 3117.74]  um so yeah super cool we're gonna have a short circuit coming where we rip around in the parking
[3117.74 --> 3121.98]  lot and the thing is guys i actually wanted to talk to the community about this because i don't know
[3121.98 --> 3131.58]  exactly what to do with it like would you guys watch a review of a go-kart like we could have
[3131.58 --> 3136.30]  alex and jake give their thoughts you know like they know what's up yeah yeah you could go way over
[3136.30 --> 3143.66]  the top and like benchmark it i mean we could i i don't know if you could find one weak enough maybe
[3143.66 --> 3150.54]  you could but like you could like dyno it man i don't even know if you could dyno it but uh we
[3150.54 --> 3156.38]  could definitely do zero to 60. well i mean it doesn't do 60. it maxes out at like 37 kilometers
[3156.38 --> 3162.54]  zero to 35. yeah zero to you know zero to 20 miles an hour or whatever like it really has some kick off
[3162.54 --> 3168.22]  the line it does about 1g of acceleration according to the spec sheet but we could verify that obviously
[3168.22 --> 3175.50]  um andy is actually really good like when we went to the local indoor go-karting place he was
[3176.86 --> 3184.06]  like him and alex just put the rest of us to absolute shame okay youtube chat is pretty much
[3184.06 --> 3191.10]  unanimous here they're like yes do it like a car review yeah i mean that's a possibility we could go
[3191.10 --> 3197.58]  totally over the top and just we have four of them i wonder if you could convince
[3198.46 --> 3205.82]  like a local go-kart place to let you like pit it against theirs yeah maybe maybe our best driver
[3205.82 --> 3212.06]  traditional yeah your best driver interesting okay you know what yeah we'll consider it we're
[3212.06 --> 3216.46]  definitely going to do the short circuit uh we could do a channel super fun or something like that
[3216.46 --> 3222.38]  that'd be pretty that'd be pretty cool uh but otherwise maybe we actually do it in the style of
[3222.38 --> 3226.62]  our car reviews or something like that the challenge with that though is we have
[3226.62 --> 3230.94]  a lot of cars lined up we're supposed to be doing one every two months that's our target which we
[3230.94 --> 3237.10]  obviously haven't done so far this year we haven't shot anything yet this year but we've got a ton of
[3237.10 --> 3242.22]  stuff lined up i think the next one's going to be the tycan and from there it's going to be like
[3243.18 --> 3250.14]  one after another after another after another there's so many electric cars coming out right now um livin says
[3250.14 --> 3257.42]  it would get roasted by a two-stroke cart i mean it depends maybe in a straight line but remember this is
[3257.42 --> 3264.78]  electric son like when you're coming out of a corner this is not and there's a lot of that on go-kart
[3264.78 --> 3272.70]  tracks yes that's basically how a go-kart track works so i don't know you might not actually be right about that
[3273.74 --> 3278.30]  and if not that's still an interesting story like it doesn't have to win for it to be an interesting story
[3278.30 --> 3283.74]  yeah uh there's a couple other things i promised i'd talk about so i might be doing a pc build with
[3283.74 --> 3292.94]  a basketball star and i'm talking like nba like an actual like yeah what okay household name so how did this
[3292.94 --> 3300.70]  happen uh it was actually one of the hardware partners that we work with who is working on a thing where
[3300.70 --> 3308.06]  they want this basketball star to do a build but i think the idea was that i'm there to come in
[3308.06 --> 3317.18]  and act as kind of like a guiding hand and make sure that a it's like entertaining to watch and b
[3317.98 --> 3324.62]  it's um it's more educational so the way that i see it i actually had a call with this person today
[3324.62 --> 3329.58]  and you know what until we've actually shot it i don't want to guarantee anything because life happens
[3329.58 --> 3334.22]  right like stuff happens it might be no fault of their own maybe they can't do it and i don't want to
[3334.22 --> 3338.94]  put them in an awkward position where all of a sudden you know i called them out saying they
[3338.94 --> 3343.10]  would they would build a pc with me and then they don't do it and they you know get pressured or
[3343.10 --> 3347.74]  whatever i don't want anything like that but i had a call with them today and i think it's going to be
[3347.74 --> 3358.86]  great because um the guy's personality is like super chill easy going um genuinely wants to learn like this is not about
[3358.86 --> 3365.98]  like me building a pc for him we're going to do it kind of like rog rig reboot but in reverse so instead
[3365.98 --> 3373.10]  of him being on the call and me being the hands he's going to build it and i'm just there to coach him
[3373.10 --> 3378.62]  through it so when we're done he will have built his own gaming pc and honestly the story is great
[3378.62 --> 3383.90]  because he's like yeah i mean you know i've always been kind of into console gaming but with the lockdown
[3383.90 --> 3389.98]  it's like i thought maybe there's another world out there and i kind of started getting into pc
[3389.98 --> 3396.14]  gaming and i really like it now i want to build my own pc gaming pc i'm stuck in hotels all the time
[3396.14 --> 3403.58]  because travel and covid so let's let's do this and i'm like this is great heck yeah because what i
[3403.58 --> 3410.62]  like about it is this is like like an everyman pc build and i don't mean that in the sense that
[3410.62 --> 3419.66]  like a star basketball athlete is an everyman on a basketball court but when it comes to building a pc
[3420.78 --> 3427.10]  he's an everyman okay so i talk about this a lot where it's really easy for the pc community
[3427.10 --> 3434.94]  to be really kind of you know look down your nose at people who don't even know what kind of ddr goes in
[3434.94 --> 3440.54]  the motherboards for this socket you know what i mean but you got to understand for most people
[3440.54 --> 3448.86]  they spend their life doing something else whether it's being focused on cooking or family or or or
[3448.86 --> 3453.82]  work or they're really into you know uh home renovation and construction whatever there's a
[3453.82 --> 3459.66]  thousand other things that they know better than you do and this is such a perfect example of someone
[3459.66 --> 3467.50]  whose life has clearly been about something else and so he's gonna come in and he's gonna ask every
[3467.50 --> 3475.02]  stupid question that everyone else has and they're afraid to ask and because he's someone that is
[3475.02 --> 3482.22]  already looked up to for his for his skill for his ability for his hard work in some other area of his
[3482.22 --> 3487.34]  life i think that's gonna make the whole scene more approachable for other people and that's what's
[3487.34 --> 3493.74]  making me really excited about it for sure yeah definitely you know like oh well if he who's obviously a
[3493.74 --> 3500.14]  literal actual master of this other thing has to ask this dumb question well now i don't feel dumb
[3500.14 --> 3505.34]  you know what i mean and so that was what the meeting today was was about us getting to kind of
[3505.34 --> 3512.30]  talk a little bit because i don't encounter a lot of like you know basketball stars in my daily life
[3512.30 --> 3518.70]  uh and i think the same probably goes the other way for tech nerds um so the idea was that we get to
[3518.70 --> 3523.98]  know each other a little bit and i got a really good vibe that he's going to be down to just ask
[3523.98 --> 3530.78]  the dumb questions and have me explain it like i'm five so that everyone else can not have to feel
[3530.78 --> 3535.66]  like that and so i thought that was super cool and i'm really excited i'm really excited to work with
[3535.66 --> 3541.58]  them awesome um there's a note in here i highly suggest getting titanfall 2 on steam yes oh this is
[3541.58 --> 3548.70]  from you okay this is for me okay so it's it's 10 bucks but that's that's not even the biggest point
[3548.70 --> 3556.38]  so i haven't talked about this on on the show too much but i for me i genuinely think the single player
[3556.94 --> 3562.22]  from titanfall 2 is the best single player of any shooter i have ever played in my life
[3563.82 --> 3569.50]  like hands down and i've pretty much played basically all of them because i really like single
[3569.50 --> 3575.66]  player shooters um i have said this a lot and basically everyone puts their nose up and then
[3575.66 --> 3581.74]  just ignores me to the point where i have basically sat multiple people down and made them play the damn
[3581.74 --> 3587.10]  game so they can experience it it's pretty short so it's not too it's not too bad to do and so far
[3587.10 --> 3591.18]  every single person that i have done that with has then co-opted my opinion on the game
[3592.62 --> 3598.86]  okay so it's just 10 bucks i think you should try it the story of this game is freaking tragic
[3598.86 --> 3604.46]  back in whenever the heck when they released it it was released right in between these other games
[3604.46 --> 3607.82]  were released like a week apart or something i don't remember exactly what but it's very close
[3607.82 --> 3612.78]  cod and battlefield yeah it was released right in the middle of those two and with no advertising it
[3612.78 --> 3619.02]  was terrible and it's an incredibly awesome game since it's been added to steam its player count has been
[3619.02 --> 3624.46]  blowing up so if you want to check out the online scene it's very popular right now and if you only
[3624.46 --> 3630.94]  bought it for the single player that price is absolutely worth it so please try it yeah it's
[3630.94 --> 3635.66]  an incredible game and that that studio they're the guys that made apex a lot of the people that come
[3635.66 --> 3640.06]  from that studio came from the original halo games you can imagine that they might make a pretty good
[3640.06 --> 3645.18]  single player game um it's yeah it's good stuff yeah you're getting a lot of backup in the float
[3645.18 --> 3651.74]  plane chat here so titanfall two guys 10 bucks on steam yeah and the the reviews the recent reviews are
[3651.74 --> 3656.38]  overwhelmingly positive and the all-time reviews are overwhelmingly positive like it's a fantastic
[3656.38 --> 3663.58]  game and it deserves more so check it out all right we've got another kind of topic that we need to
[3663.58 --> 3671.18]  talk through um out of nowhere a canada computers employee is blowing a whistle on the company's
[3671.18 --> 3681.18]  alleged substantial stock of geforce rtx 3000s that they are refusing to sell despite having taken
[3681.18 --> 3687.82]  back orders um the allegation is that many stores have stopped getting new shipments of 30 series gpus
[3687.82 --> 3694.46]  all together why after it became oh we should have totally done this topic before the verified
[3694.46 --> 3699.82]  actual gamer program drop probably but that's okay the why is after it became clear that the gpus would
[3699.82 --> 3705.02]  be in short supply allocations that should have gone to stores or would have gone to stores were apparently
[3705.02 --> 3711.90]  held at head office for a new custom build program now here's the thing margins on gpus are low like
[3711.90 --> 3717.74]  i'm gonna tell you guys a little secret here hold on let me bring up my shopify dashboard okay so our
[3717.74 --> 3725.50]  sales today uh with those 30 cards that we added to it that's so that's a thousand dollars right times 30
[3725.50 --> 3733.74]  cards that's that's thirty thousand dollars that's a lot of money but get this even though our revenue
[3733.74 --> 3743.90]  today hold on let me look at yesterday is up substantially our profit is actually oh no
[3744.78 --> 3753.50]  i only look at this on mobile and the layout is slightly different on i've become that guy i only look
[3753.50 --> 3762.06]  at it on uh i only look at these reports on my phone uh okay yeah so our profit today is let me check
[3762.06 --> 3770.62]  against yesterday wow just over half even though our sales are much higher because there is no
[3770.62 --> 3777.66]  flipping margin in graphics cards so why are why is canada computers allegedly holding these cards and
[3777.66 --> 3783.42]  headquarters well because if they sell the graphics card as part of a system that has other components
[3783.42 --> 3789.74]  they can actually make money on like cases power supplies fans then they can make way more money as a
[3789.74 --> 3795.42]  whole because they're the ones that have gpus so people can buy their systems now because there's
[3795.42 --> 3800.86]  there's people that there's a a strategy that's being pushed by the community actually which is to
[3800.86 --> 3806.94]  buy these systems and then flip the other parts now allegedly these builds are hastily thrown together
[3806.94 --> 3813.02]  to mean more service calls i don't know if i would necessarily buy that and the op says that head office
[3813.02 --> 3821.66]  wants to end back orders full stop and just do builds now here's a hot take there's a hot take and a half
[3822.38 --> 3833.42]  okay luke yeah i have personally with these two hands walked into the back and hand allocated
[3833.42 --> 3839.66]  incoming graphics cards for systems i have done it
[3843.02 --> 3843.90]  so what
[3848.70 --> 3853.18]  well i think the issue here is that they're on yes like they have accepted orders right like it's a bit
[3853.18 --> 3859.10]  different so that's the difference that's what we're getting into okay so when i was at ncix
[3859.10 --> 3867.02]  i would not have done that if there was already an order for the product ncix did a lot of things wrong
[3867.66 --> 3875.98]  but not honoring fifo was not at least in the time that i was there was not one of them so fifo means first in
[3876.54 --> 3883.98]  first out your first order in is your first order out and one of the things that ncix
[3883.98 --> 3889.82]  ncix didn't do well was that they would actually take people's money on back orders where they
[3889.82 --> 3895.58]  weren't a hundred percent sure when it would come but the redeeming quality was that when the bloody
[3895.58 --> 3901.82]  thing came at least you got your part they also didn't have a very good system for like if we had an
[3901.82 --> 3909.98]  evga ko and an evga ssc and the ko was way back ordered and the ssc was only like 10 more dollars and
[3909.98 --> 3914.46]  we got a ton of these and we had a ton of back orders of these we wouldn't unless it was super
[3914.46 --> 3919.42]  bad super allocated it was done very manually we wouldn't say we wouldn't go pull these and say
[3919.42 --> 3923.18]  okay hey we need to contact all those guys see if they want to upgrade for 10 bucks that's something
[3923.18 --> 3929.74]  they didn't do a good job of either but at least we did fifo so here's the problem is that canada
[3929.74 --> 3936.46]  computers has taken these orders and they are allegedly sitting on thousands of dollars worth of paid back
[3936.46 --> 3943.82]  orders that can't uh that can be fulfilled but they won't even they won't do it because they're
[3943.82 --> 3949.90]  waiting around for people to buy an entire system a now deleted custom sop outlines the following
[3950.54 --> 3956.06]  all custom build packages with a shortage item are final sale defective exchange can happen only within
[3956.06 --> 3962.70]  the first 30 days of purchase parts can't be greater than 45 percent of total cost so you can't put a
[3962.70 --> 3969.98]  900 gpu in a 2 000 build build must have cpu motherboard ram case and storage and custom
[3969.98 --> 3974.22]  builds must be a hundred percent paid for before the parts will ship okay that i understand that
[3974.22 --> 3978.94]  makes sense of course now this is interesting anthony actually has a hot take in here too the shop i
[3978.94 --> 3983.50]  worked at pulled parts off the shelf as needed for new builds and most people expect cc to do this too
[3983.50 --> 3988.38]  it wouldn't be controversial if these were si allocations but they are retail cards but i guarantee this
[3988.38 --> 3994.14]  is more common than we think and that's a very good point because one of the big final pushes that
[3994.14 --> 4001.42]  sealed the deal for me on doing verified actual gamer program was the rtx 3060 launch nvidia told me
[4001.42 --> 4009.26]  there's lots board partners told me there's lots retailers told me there aren't any and i kind of went
[4012.14 --> 4018.14]  now nvidia's response to that was well hey you're probably talking to like rinky dink shops and i was
[4018.14 --> 4026.30]  like you think i'm a idiot i i don't know i don't know where to buy a graphics card like what kind
[4026.30 --> 4034.70]  of answer is that obviously i know where to get a graphics card like thank you very much um so no
[4035.34 --> 4040.94]  something went wrong hence verified actual gamer program i mean i don't know i don't know maybe maybe
[4040.94 --> 4045.90]  nvidia cares maybe they don't uh i did invite them to join the verified actual gamer program and they
[4045.90 --> 4051.42]  politely declined so i don't know they also have probably their own separate reasons for not
[4051.42 --> 4058.46]  wanting to work with me but uh whatever it is whatever it is uh hey we're gonna have a radeon
[4058.46 --> 4066.38]  drop coming in the next little bit here 270 cards rx 6800 xt um so thank you very much amd for actually
[4066.38 --> 4074.14]  giving it and well i guess that's it i guess that's all i can say about that yeah what i would probably
[4074.14 --> 4079.98]  say is there is there's there's we're fairly certain there's more bad going on behind the
[4079.98 --> 4086.46]  scenes than this and and this is a bit more well i think it's still a problem because of the like
[4086.46 --> 4092.46]  they're they're already backordered by customers thing i have no issue whatsoever with with companies
[4092.46 --> 4097.42]  taking stuff off the shelf in order to build systems if that thing isn't sold who cares that that
[4097.98 --> 4101.42]  means nothing to me at all i don't think that's a problem the slightest and i don't think anyone in the
[4101.42 --> 4105.50]  community cares about that either but if they are already sold they shouldn't be taking those things
[4105.50 --> 4110.14]  and putting them in systems um but yeah there's there's there's more going on than this that's
[4110.14 --> 4116.22]  yeah that's where we'll leave it and i think that's where we're gonna leave the show today thank you
[4116.22 --> 4121.50]  very much for tuning in ladies and gentlemen i hope y'all enjoyed it wait i think i said we were
[4121.50 --> 4127.18]  going to talk about project x cloud but we didn't uh uh okay it's in beta on pc and ios game pass
[4127.18 --> 4130.14]  ultimate subscribers will be invited over the course of the beta it's browser-based with support for
[4130.14 --> 4133.18]  multiple leading web browsers like chrome safari and of course edge there's no firm date on when
[4133.18 --> 4136.38]  the service will go live for everyone allegedly it feels like x cloud on android so you can expect
[4136.38 --> 4141.74]  latency and input issues it's running similar to what the xbox one s has which is jaguar 8 core
[4141.74 --> 4145.90]  blah blah blah blah blah blah load times are rough due to hard drive why would they put a hard drive in
[4145.90 --> 4151.98]  it okay and also the series x and series s are getting amd fidelity fx um wow that's cool which
[4151.98 --> 4157.98]  narrows the gap between a pc version and an xbox version that's cool man xbox there you man microsoft is
[4157.98 --> 4163.74]  just like oh no way they removed the xbox live gold subscription requirements for multiplayer and
[4163.74 --> 4168.78]  free-to-play titles yes i thought it was some free-to-play titles but i'm not i'm not maybe
[4168.78 --> 4173.58]  it maybe it is all i'm not sure there are going to be a lot of shrieking children in microphones
[4173.58 --> 4178.38]  over the next little bit i'm i hate to be the latest but man when team fortress 2 went free-to-play
[4178.38 --> 4185.34]  that game died to me it was it was yeah yeah i'm sorry this it was a different flow play knows it's a
[4185.34 --> 4192.22]  different community that pays for a service yes this is flow plane is highly aware of that yeah
[4192.22 --> 4196.46]  they're aware of just the difference in community all right let's go ahead and get through some super
[4196.46 --> 4203.18]  chats then robert mail says lola bunny collab confirmed question mark um you know no you know
[4203.18 --> 4211.58]  the lola bunny redesign is totally unacceptable we can't we can't stand for it rise up gamers can you even
[4211.58 --> 4217.50]  you know i'm not even gonna you know what i'm just gonna say that whole thing ridiculous and then
[4217.50 --> 4222.38]  i'm just not gonna say anymore uh grizzly garage says there's only one man who can break into apple
[4223.18 --> 4229.42]  tim apple wait what okay i don't get it apple get it because yeah okay luke regardless of what
[4229.42 --> 4236.14]  what anyone says keep that mustache oh no we were gonna acknowledge it um gamba it's actually been
[4236.14 --> 4245.90]  exhausting trying to ignore it the whole show it's in my sight line sorry okay okay okay gamba says fox
[4245.90 --> 4251.42]  finance to the moon i have no idea what that is but it sounds like probably spam that i probably shouldn't
[4251.42 --> 4256.38]  have read uh charles says linus less repairable isn't necessarily awful for the environment
[4257.58 --> 4264.06]  less repairability leads people to upgrade to more energy efficient devices and makes devices more durable
[4264.06 --> 4266.54]  more accessible extending their lifetime
[4271.34 --> 4271.74]  huh
[4273.82 --> 4278.94]  profits business guru says saw your stream talking about amazon how complex it is we specialize in this
[4278.94 --> 4285.66]  and bought three tumblers to shoot some optimized amazon photos for us who can i reach out to at ltd to
[4285.66 --> 4290.54]  talk about your amazon store you could just reach out to uh uh ltd store support actually i don't know
[4290.54 --> 4297.90]  maybe they'll want to talk to you um maybe man since when are the super chats like other businesses
[4297.90 --> 4302.30]  reaching out to me about stuff tails says this is my first super chat ever love your work watch for
[4302.30 --> 4309.02]  years also subbed on float plane keep it up hey thanks tails um thank you funny hat says update on the
[4309.02 --> 4315.90]  real pmp 300 bounty youtuber dank pods appears to have one yeah dank pods yeah yeah i think we already
[4315.90 --> 4321.26]  have one but thank you very much uh i found out what happened with that dank pods did reach out to us
[4321.26 --> 4326.30]  and it went straight to spam colton sent me a screenshot today so dank pods you gotta find out
[4326.30 --> 4331.42]  why your email is going to spam dog i don't know why but we didn't block you or anything it just was
[4331.42 --> 4340.94]  automatically flagged um nice john bray love it it's a cool story bro z storm as a daily driver of the note
[4340.94 --> 4345.66]  nine are you aware of the green tint issue that exynos variants develop after updating to android 10.
[4345.66 --> 4353.34]  no and i don't have an exynos variant so i probably won't see it uh spleen be gone tried to get one for
[4353.34 --> 4357.58]  a friend that just built a computer looks like i missed out have ten dollars instead oh thanks spleen be
[4357.58 --> 4364.14]  gone uh dbzm says channel super fun lap time stop competition yeah i'd love to do like a channel super
[4364.14 --> 4370.70]  fun thing with it maybe we could like rent an indoor track uh you probably could the orca says
[4370.94 --> 4378.14]  i bought a used 2060 from an angry parent today off craigslist for its original price
[4378.78 --> 4387.26]  i get home turns out to be a 3060. i called they did not even care i'm so happy i feel the need to
[4387.26 --> 4395.58]  throw money at you guys don't off mom i would say i feel bad for that kid but from the sounds of it the
[4395.58 --> 4403.66]  kid didn't buy it so wow don't piss off mom obscure paradox says first time catching the stream live
[4403.66 --> 4410.06]  massive fan ever considered doing xoc if so happy to lend all the equipment what the devil is xoc
[4412.54 --> 4420.62]  like evga's overclocking software or yeah that's what that doesn't make much sense to me though i wonder
[4420.62 --> 4428.06]  if you done typoed your 20 super chat dog that's a little awkward um it's a mayan word for fish okay
[4429.18 --> 4433.98]  could bill gates build a gaming pc hmm says leandro that would actually be a very fun collab i'd be
[4433.98 --> 4442.78]  super down to do it extreme overland camping i have no idea not a clue dude people are trying to guess
[4442.78 --> 4448.14]  the nba player that we're going to collab with i will not confirm or deny until we have actually shot it
[4449.02 --> 4456.30]  uh denny martel says got a 5900x and now a 6800xt thanks you are now officially verified gamer
[4456.30 --> 4462.54]  programmed out we are allowing duplicates on cpu and gpu but we are not allowing duplicates on two of
[4462.54 --> 4468.54]  the same thing so yeah so you're allowed to win twice if they are entirely different products as in as
[4469.26 --> 4474.22]  entirely different product sections it's not a duplicate you don't get to get two cpus and two gpus yes
[4474.22 --> 4480.86]  correct one cpu one gpu oh people are like extreme overclocking oh like dry ice liquid nitrogen all
[4480.86 --> 4488.38]  that kind of stuff you know it's one of those things that's never really appealed to me me neither hot
[4488.38 --> 4501.26]  i just don't care it's so like i'm into impractical i would even i we have done a phase change build guide before
[4501.26 --> 4512.46]  but to me if it's something that you have to continuously top up it's just not um it's just
[4512.46 --> 4518.86]  not interesting uh like it's interesting in terms of i'll look at other people doing it and i'll be
[4518.86 --> 4525.82]  like whoa great result that is so cool and i will genuinely mean it but do you guys have any idea how
[4525.82 --> 4535.10]  tedious it actually is to actually do it like all the minutiae of you know adjusting this stupid thing
[4535.10 --> 4544.70]  and this other stupid thing and yeah i just i just can't care i'm sorry it's not to run 24 7. he that
[4544.70 --> 4551.74]  that's the point right he knows that's why i don't care like to be clear it's not that i'm not crazy i
[4551.74 --> 4561.82]  literally ran a chiller as a daily driver i took a like you know two foot by three foot chiller with
[4561.82 --> 4569.58]  my gaming pc okay my e6600 overclocked to like whatever the crap it was i took it to a land party
[4569.58 --> 4576.38]  okay they had to get a separate circuit for my station so that it wouldn't trip the breaker it was
[4576.38 --> 4584.54]  very kind of them but i daily drove it 24 7 baby if it ain't 24 7 i just don't give a that's just all
[4584.54 --> 4593.74]  there is to it i'm sorry and that's it i'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[4593.74 --> 4606.30]  oh we've got people asking if all the cards are reserved oh yes quite quickly we knew that this
[4606.30 --> 4612.86]  is going to be the most dialed in possible audience and they were going to be moving as fast as possible
[4613.74 --> 4620.38]  um robert adams says if an nba player is collabing with you it's obviously going to be a bench warmer
[4620.38 --> 4626.06]  who's got a maximum of 15 seconds of career playing time on the court what is the point of
[4626.06 --> 4633.26]  tuning into a channel to say something like that and they want to contribute to you and make you
[4633.90 --> 4638.30]  uh a bigger and better creator uh but they also want to belittle you so they can feel better about
[4638.30 --> 4643.42]  themselves unbelievable all right well um see you later ladies and gentlemen
[4643.42 --> 4652.22]  uh for the person that asked if there was a queue after linus told people that it would be too late
[4652.22 --> 4658.22]  by then and that they should just leave the queue it was still at over 2 000 people in in line so
[4658.70 --> 4665.42]  there's definitely a queue oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
