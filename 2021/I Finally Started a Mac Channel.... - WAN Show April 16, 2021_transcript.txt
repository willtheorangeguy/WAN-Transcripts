[0.00 --> 0.70]  this selection.
[1.70 --> 2.78]  My friends called me.
[2.86 --> 5.18]  They said the stuff that I resume is the best.
[5.64 --> 5.80]  Yeah.
[6.02 --> 6.86]  Oh, we're live.
[7.32 --> 9.28]  Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[9.42 --> 12.16]  We've got a fantastic show lined up for y'all today
[12.16 --> 13.46]  with a bunch of great topics,
[13.58 --> 15.70]  starting, of course, with why it is that
[15.70 --> 18.46]  at exactly whenever I start WAN show
[18.46 --> 19.50]  on a Friday afternoon,
[19.66 --> 21.86]  Google Docs decides it is the perfect time
[21.86 --> 24.82]  to log me out so I can't see any of my show notes.
[24.96 --> 26.00]  Luke, why don't you go ahead
[26.00 --> 28.42]  and start us off with a couple of the big topics
[28.42 --> 29.98]  for today while I sign back in.
[30.58 --> 33.46]  Yeah, well, NVIDIA is entering the CPU
[33.46 --> 36.18]  and laptop business in a move that
[36.18 --> 38.14]  some people kind of smelt coming,
[38.36 --> 40.06]  but weren't 100% sure on.
[40.82 --> 43.68]  Microsoft's acquisition streak continues,
[44.08 --> 45.82]  even amongst all the rumors
[45.82 --> 47.46]  and actual that happened
[47.46 --> 48.88]  was that they bought Nuance
[48.88 --> 51.04]  for almost $20 billion.
[51.68 --> 53.48]  Microsoft seems to be very excited
[53.48 --> 56.96]  by things that are around the $20 billion mark.
[56.96 --> 59.20]  Yeah, I mean, you know,
[59.20 --> 62.82]  it's affordable, but not ostentatious.
[62.94 --> 63.80]  You know, it's like,
[64.44 --> 66.00]  or most kind of the same thing.
[66.24 --> 66.62]  Whatever.
[66.82 --> 67.76]  The point is, it's,
[67.84 --> 70.40]  you know, it's worth buying,
[70.50 --> 71.66]  but not too expensive.
[72.12 --> 72.48]  You know?
[73.20 --> 75.48]  It was throwing money all over the place.
[75.48 --> 78.30]  We're also announcing that Linus Media Group
[78.30 --> 83.26]  has officially entered the Apple content game.
[83.36 --> 83.92]  That's right.
[83.98 --> 85.16]  We've got a new channel
[85.16 --> 86.64]  and I'll be giving you guys the rundown
[86.64 --> 88.22]  on how that whole thing works.
[88.68 --> 89.74]  And finally,
[90.44 --> 93.48]  iOS users will be losing access
[93.48 --> 95.46]  to Discord servers
[95.46 --> 97.42]  labeled not safe for work.
[97.42 --> 98.44]  Like,
[98.66 --> 100.04]  what?
[100.64 --> 101.04]  The...
[101.04 --> 103.06]  Wait, hold on.
[103.10 --> 104.04]  Are iOS users going to be able
[104.04 --> 104.60]  to listen to that?
[105.46 --> 106.16]  I mean, I bleeped it.
[106.20 --> 106.72]  Is that okay?
[107.30 --> 108.50]  Am I allowed to bleep it?
[108.50 --> 108.94]  It's not on Discord.
[109.08 --> 109.42]  You're fine.
[109.56 --> 109.90]  You're fine.
[110.06 --> 111.46]  Okay, as long as it's not on Discord,
[111.58 --> 112.16]  then I can say...
[112.16 --> 112.28]  Yeah.
[112.98 --> 113.32]  Okay.
[113.58 --> 114.58]  Okay, I'm just checking.
[114.68 --> 115.24]  I'm just checking,
[115.32 --> 116.38]  making sure that that's okay
[116.38 --> 117.14]  with Daddy Cook.
[117.46 --> 118.16]  Dude, they should just,
[118.38 --> 119.50]  they should just ban browsers.
[119.84 --> 121.06]  There's not safe for work content
[121.06 --> 121.64]  on browsers.
[121.82 --> 122.64]  Wait, oh no.
[122.96 --> 123.06]  Oh.
[123.20 --> 124.74]  There's also user-generated content
[124.74 --> 125.00]  on browsers.
[125.00 --> 125.88]  We're going to have to ban Safari.
[126.46 --> 126.70]  Okay.
[127.02 --> 127.36]  Hold on.
[127.40 --> 128.08]  We've got to roll the intro
[128.08 --> 129.44]  before we get turned off.
[129.52 --> 129.76]  Here, here.
[129.82 --> 130.28]  Go, go, go.
[150.28 --> 152.58]  And the show is brought to y'all today
[152.58 --> 153.34]  by...
[153.34 --> 153.72]  Oh, shoot.
[153.80 --> 154.04]  I forgot.
[154.04 --> 156.54]  Definitely Squarespace.
[156.78 --> 157.58]  I remember that one
[157.58 --> 158.52]  off the top of my head.
[158.96 --> 159.74]  And also,
[160.76 --> 162.54]  Phantom Wallet and Pulseway.
[163.00 --> 163.48]  You got it.
[163.84 --> 164.88]  We're going to have
[164.88 --> 168.28]  a fantastic show for you guys.
[168.74 --> 169.62]  Why don't we go straight
[169.62 --> 171.14]  into the headline topic,
[171.28 --> 172.56]  which is naturally
[172.56 --> 174.98]  the brand new channel
[174.98 --> 176.58]  from Linus Media Group.
[176.66 --> 178.22]  Now, I know what you guys
[178.22 --> 178.80]  are going to say.
[178.86 --> 179.28]  I'm ready.
[179.38 --> 180.20]  I'm ready for it.
[180.58 --> 182.34]  The criticism is going to be,
[182.34 --> 184.88]  Linus, how can we possibly expect you
[184.88 --> 185.88]  to cover Apple fairly
[185.88 --> 187.82]  because you are clearly
[187.82 --> 189.58]  biased against Apple.
[190.58 --> 191.10]  Okay.
[191.10 --> 191.98]  That's what some people
[191.98 --> 192.56]  are going to say.
[192.98 --> 193.68]  And then there's going to be
[193.68 --> 194.72]  a whole bunch of other people
[194.72 --> 195.28]  that say,
[195.82 --> 197.00]  Linus, you're the biggest
[197.00 --> 198.26]  Apple fanboy ever.
[198.82 --> 199.68]  LTT is basically
[199.68 --> 201.14]  already an Apple channel.
[201.14 --> 202.58]  He can't be the biggest
[202.58 --> 203.44]  Apple fanboy ever
[203.44 --> 205.10]  because he opened the channel
[205.10 --> 206.36]  with the first video
[206.36 --> 207.78]  on a Mac-focused channel
[207.78 --> 208.86]  criticizing Apple.
[209.76 --> 210.74]  Well, I wouldn't say
[210.74 --> 211.22]  it's criticizing.
[211.32 --> 211.52]  Okay.
[211.58 --> 212.22]  So hold on a second.
[212.34 --> 212.74]  Hold on.
[212.80 --> 213.88]  You're getting ahead of it here.
[214.00 --> 214.64]  First, we've got
[214.64 --> 215.54]  what the community
[215.54 --> 216.38]  is going to say, okay?
[216.70 --> 217.20]  So you're going to have
[217.20 --> 217.86]  the people that say,
[218.00 --> 218.58]  I can't do it
[218.58 --> 220.30]  because I hate Apple.
[220.46 --> 221.04]  And then you're going
[221.04 --> 221.50]  to have the people
[221.50 --> 222.38]  who say, I can't do it
[222.38 --> 223.80]  because I love Apple too much.
[223.90 --> 224.86]  Which, by the way,
[224.92 --> 225.72]  for those of you
[225.72 --> 227.28]  who are on either side,
[227.62 --> 228.52]  yes, in fact,
[228.76 --> 230.02]  the people on the other side
[230.02 --> 231.14]  do exist
[231.14 --> 232.38]  because fanboys,
[232.54 --> 233.86]  as soon as they hear one thing,
[233.90 --> 234.68]  it's kind of like,
[234.72 --> 235.66]  what is it?
[235.72 --> 237.54]  Like birds that get imprinted
[237.54 --> 237.98]  or whatever.
[238.14 --> 239.32]  Like the first thing they see
[239.32 --> 239.96]  is their mother
[239.96 --> 241.14]  or something like that.
[241.44 --> 241.94]  Oh, yeah.
[242.02 --> 243.22]  So basically,
[243.58 --> 244.18]  immediately,
[244.46 --> 246.40]  like rabid Android fanboys,
[246.52 --> 247.64]  they'll see me pull an iPhone
[247.64 --> 248.50]  out of my pocket
[248.50 --> 249.46]  and record some video
[249.46 --> 249.72]  or whatever.
[249.78 --> 250.08]  And they're like,
[250.14 --> 250.84]  oh, disgusting.
[251.34 --> 251.74]  Disgusting.
[252.12 --> 252.72]  She's a sheep.
[252.80 --> 253.86]  He's lost cause.
[254.02 --> 254.52]  Or, you know,
[254.56 --> 255.98]  when I happen to give
[255.98 --> 257.38]  the iPhone 6S,
[257.48 --> 259.80]  my like product of the year award
[259.80 --> 262.04]  in 2016 or 2017
[262.04 --> 263.08]  or whenever that was,
[263.18 --> 264.26]  like, oh, disgusting.
[264.44 --> 265.30]  He's the worst person ever.
[265.84 --> 267.08]  And then people will see me
[267.08 --> 268.24]  daily drive a Note 9
[268.24 --> 268.94]  and they'll be like,
[269.06 --> 269.34]  first,
[269.70 --> 271.02]  what the f*** are you doing?
[271.08 --> 272.16]  You can have any phone you want
[272.16 --> 272.82]  while you're using
[272.82 --> 273.92]  a three-year-old phone.
[273.96 --> 274.54]  And then second,
[274.88 --> 275.26]  they'll be like,
[275.28 --> 276.06]  oh, he hates Apple.
[276.12 --> 277.14]  He hates Apple too much.
[277.90 --> 279.38]  So, you know,
[279.38 --> 280.46]  I don't hate Apple.
[280.54 --> 281.38]  I don't love Apple.
[281.52 --> 281.76]  To me,
[281.82 --> 283.60]  they are a manufacturer of products
[283.60 --> 284.34]  and they're just kind of
[284.34 --> 285.54]  nothing more or less
[285.54 --> 286.26]  than that to me.
[286.66 --> 287.90]  The things that I do find
[287.90 --> 289.26]  frustrating about Apple
[289.26 --> 290.04]  are that I think
[290.04 --> 291.90]  as a company,
[292.08 --> 293.52]  their culture is one of arrogance
[293.52 --> 296.82]  and pretension.
[297.36 --> 298.66]  I think that there's a lot
[298.66 --> 299.90]  of others like them.
[299.98 --> 301.04]  I think there's a lot
[301.04 --> 302.28]  of companies that behave
[302.28 --> 303.42]  in a lot of the same ways,
[303.52 --> 304.18]  but Apple manages
[304.18 --> 305.54]  to be extremely far up
[305.54 --> 306.20]  their own butts
[306.20 --> 307.72]  about how great they are
[307.72 --> 308.34]  and how much better
[308.34 --> 309.18]  what they're doing is
[309.18 --> 309.98]  when a lot of the time
[309.98 --> 310.48]  their actions
[310.48 --> 311.52]  don't really match up
[311.52 --> 312.08]  with their words.
[312.42 --> 313.10]  So we've got a video
[313.10 --> 313.90]  coming up on
[313.90 --> 314.64]  right to repair
[314.64 --> 316.26]  and whether it's
[316.26 --> 317.02]  right or not,
[317.06 --> 317.98]  we do end up focusing
[317.98 --> 318.76]  a fair bit
[318.76 --> 320.52]  on Apple's double talk
[320.52 --> 321.46]  when it comes to
[321.46 --> 322.22]  their concerns
[322.22 --> 323.18]  about the environment
[323.18 --> 324.44]  and their behavior
[324.44 --> 325.42]  when it comes to
[325.42 --> 327.26]  taking care of consumers,
[327.48 --> 328.74]  especially regarding
[328.74 --> 329.34]  right to repair.
[329.42 --> 330.10]  Not because Apple's
[330.10 --> 330.52]  the only one
[330.52 --> 331.54]  who behaves inappropriately,
[331.74 --> 333.28]  but because the hypocrisy
[333.28 --> 334.10]  is so poignant
[334.10 --> 335.58]  with Apple in particular.
[335.58 --> 337.54]  So how then is it,
[337.66 --> 338.42]  coming back
[338.42 --> 339.42]  to my original question,
[339.42 --> 341.14]  that I could possibly
[341.14 --> 342.42]  be trusted
[342.42 --> 344.04]  to be the face
[344.04 --> 346.22]  of an Apple-focused
[346.22 --> 347.92]  news and product review
[347.92 --> 349.36]  and rumors channel?
[349.74 --> 350.74]  The answer is,
[351.18 --> 352.56]  I clearly can't,
[352.98 --> 354.02]  which is why we hired
[354.02 --> 354.80]  somebody else.
[355.30 --> 355.90]  Yeah, he's not.
[356.16 --> 356.32]  Yeah.
[356.54 --> 357.58]  So let's go ahead
[357.58 --> 359.34]  and show you guys
[359.34 --> 361.40]  what the very first video
[361.40 --> 364.24]  on Mac address looks like.
[364.50 --> 364.94]  Can I just,
[365.00 --> 366.00]  can I just take a moment
[366.00 --> 368.04]  and give myself a kudos
[368.04 --> 369.34]  for the name of this channel?
[370.22 --> 371.38]  You liked it more than,
[371.54 --> 372.26]  than what was it,
[372.32 --> 373.36]  Apple talk or whatever?
[373.48 --> 374.18]  So Apple talk
[374.18 --> 375.12]  is already a podcast
[375.12 --> 376.82]  because we waited 10 years
[376.82 --> 377.98]  after originally coming up
[377.98 --> 378.46]  with the idea
[378.46 --> 380.12]  to actually do anything with it.
[380.36 --> 381.92]  And it might have even existed
[381.92 --> 382.68]  at the time.
[382.80 --> 384.12]  Like, I don't actually know.
[384.92 --> 386.68]  So Mac address is,
[386.68 --> 388.26]  whoops, hold on a second.
[388.26 --> 390.08]  So Mac address is
[390.08 --> 392.28]  something that still manages
[392.28 --> 394.46]  to speak nerdy to me
[394.46 --> 395.36]  a little bit, you know?
[396.00 --> 397.82]  But I think it also has
[397.82 --> 399.34]  a really clear double meaning.
[399.62 --> 400.70]  Mac address is the place
[400.70 --> 402.60]  to go for Mac, right?
[403.30 --> 404.58]  So I think it's,
[404.58 --> 405.16]  I think it's key.
[405.16 --> 406.36]  It addresses Mac.
[406.92 --> 409.74]  So this is Jonathan Horst.
[410.26 --> 411.04]  He actually,
[411.32 --> 412.48]  we had a lot of people
[412.48 --> 414.84]  posting comments and tweets
[414.84 --> 416.86]  and all kinds of stuff like that,
[416.92 --> 417.74]  getting in touch with us,
[417.74 --> 418.72]  saying, you know,
[418.80 --> 419.92]  hey, sorry,
[420.52 --> 421.62]  who is this guy exactly?
[422.82 --> 424.66]  He is, he actually,
[424.74 --> 425.38]  oh, I don't know.
[425.38 --> 426.10]  I don't want to talk
[426.10 --> 427.44]  out of turn too much about him,
[427.50 --> 428.74]  but maybe we'll have him
[428.74 --> 429.38]  on the WAN show
[429.38 --> 430.58]  or something to introduce himself.
[430.58 --> 432.08]  Or you guys can subscribe
[432.08 --> 432.86]  to the channel,
[433.28 --> 435.36]  youtube.com slash Mac address.
[435.48 --> 436.84]  I think we've claimed that.
[436.98 --> 437.26]  Hold on.
[437.40 --> 438.56]  You know what you guys should do?
[439.24 --> 439.68]  Yeah.
[440.44 --> 443.18]  I mean, Mac address is on float plane.
[443.72 --> 446.18]  So if you subscribe to LTT,
[446.34 --> 447.26]  you can see Mac address stuff
[447.26 --> 447.68]  on float plane.
[447.92 --> 450.14]  So you could do a meet the team.
[450.34 --> 451.58]  We could totally do meet the team.
[451.66 --> 452.88]  Yes, we should do that.
[452.88 --> 454.36]  We've got lots of great behind the scenes
[454.36 --> 455.24]  on float plane lately,
[455.34 --> 457.16]  but yeah, youtube.com slash Mac address.
[457.52 --> 458.32]  Go subscribe.
[458.54 --> 459.36]  You'll get to know him.
[459.50 --> 462.00]  But basically he didn't have
[462.00 --> 464.14]  any kind of online
[464.14 --> 469.26]  sort of tech video making experience.
[469.52 --> 471.04]  We just sourced him
[471.04 --> 472.42]  through like,
[472.94 --> 473.60]  sourced him.
[473.68 --> 474.54]  Sounds so corporate.
[474.70 --> 477.36]  We met him through like a more,
[477.50 --> 478.88]  honestly,
[478.88 --> 479.96]  a more corporate type
[479.96 --> 480.94]  of recruitment strategy.
[480.94 --> 482.52]  We just like posted a job posting
[482.52 --> 483.88]  and he just happened to be
[483.88 --> 486.28]  an exemplary candidate
[486.28 --> 488.18]  and we absolutely loved him.
[488.34 --> 489.56]  So we hired him,
[489.68 --> 490.22]  brought him in.
[490.32 --> 492.20]  He has such a passion for Apple
[492.20 --> 493.84]  and in ways that,
[493.92 --> 495.68]  you know how I was,
[495.72 --> 496.72]  I was kind of joking
[496.72 --> 498.16]  in a certain way
[498.16 --> 499.82]  about how I'm like not qualified
[499.82 --> 501.20]  to talk about Apple.
[501.32 --> 503.14]  I know enough to make a video
[503.14 --> 504.00]  about an Apple product
[504.00 --> 505.36]  or an Apple business decision
[505.36 --> 506.52]  or whatever if it comes to it.
[506.86 --> 509.40]  But he considers Apple
[509.40 --> 510.36]  in a way that I think
[510.36 --> 511.08]  is more similar
[511.08 --> 513.28]  to how Apple users
[513.28 --> 515.18]  consider Apple.
[515.40 --> 516.34]  Like one of the things
[516.34 --> 517.60]  that he talked about
[517.60 --> 518.80]  during his interview
[518.80 --> 519.74]  that I thought was,
[520.20 --> 521.78]  I mean to me kind of funny
[521.78 --> 523.74]  because like who gives a shit,
[523.86 --> 526.42]  but really, really important
[526.42 --> 527.38]  to that crowd
[527.38 --> 528.42]  was he was talking about
[528.42 --> 529.74]  the way that Apple's
[529.74 --> 532.64]  design language has shifted
[532.64 --> 534.98]  in terms of the way
[534.98 --> 537.12]  that iOS icons look
[537.12 --> 538.38]  like over the years
[538.38 --> 540.30]  and how it used to be,
[540.42 --> 540.94]  I don't know,
[541.02 --> 543.62]  he used some sort of $40 word
[543.62 --> 545.40]  that I can't remember,
[545.52 --> 546.34]  but probably comes up
[546.34 --> 547.64]  in art school once in a while
[547.64 --> 548.82]  if you're into that sort of thing.
[549.16 --> 549.84]  And then he was like,
[549.90 --> 550.52]  yeah, and they don't really
[550.52 --> 551.06]  do that anymore.
[551.18 --> 552.64]  Everything's like too flat now.
[553.16 --> 554.08]  And, you know,
[554.10 --> 555.34]  but then also they're kind
[555.34 --> 556.30]  of going back to this
[556.30 --> 557.26]  in like this way
[557.26 --> 557.88]  and that way.
[557.88 --> 558.86]  And like, you know,
[558.86 --> 560.60]  the way they like change
[560.60 --> 562.12]  color schemes here and there.
[562.12 --> 562.98]  And I'm like, oh, wow.
[563.08 --> 563.28]  Yeah.
[563.38 --> 564.02]  Okay, cool.
[564.48 --> 565.66]  You are totally speaking
[565.66 --> 567.06]  a language that like
[567.06 --> 567.94]  when I would review,
[568.16 --> 569.54]  when I'd review an iPhone,
[570.00 --> 571.02]  I'd be like, yeah.
[571.14 --> 571.84]  So like, you know,
[572.00 --> 573.82]  back in the day, right?
[573.86 --> 574.62]  Like browser,
[575.10 --> 577.20]  browser page load times
[577.20 --> 577.60]  and, you know,
[577.60 --> 578.22]  stuff like that,
[578.26 --> 578.96]  stuff that was actually
[578.96 --> 579.92]  meaningful to me.
[580.22 --> 581.96]  And there'd be all this stuff
[581.96 --> 582.86]  that would be in
[582.86 --> 584.14]  everyone else's coverage.
[584.14 --> 584.72]  It's like, yeah.
[584.72 --> 584.98]  And they,
[585.08 --> 586.42]  and they change the color
[586.42 --> 587.10]  of the shade
[587.10 --> 588.12]  when you drag it down
[588.12 --> 588.80]  and they change this
[588.80 --> 589.22]  and they change this.
[589.34 --> 590.14]  I'm like, I don't,
[590.14 --> 590.84]  I don't care.
[591.24 --> 591.98]  Like that makes
[591.98 --> 592.80]  notice that at all.
[593.00 --> 593.60]  Literally, no,
[593.64 --> 594.24]  I wouldn't notice
[594.24 --> 595.52]  in a thousand years.
[595.52 --> 596.42]  Like if you gave me
[596.42 --> 598.26]  like a bunch of,
[598.42 --> 599.86]  if you gave me two iOS devices
[599.86 --> 601.04]  or the same iOS device
[601.04 --> 603.02]  running like iOS 7
[603.02 --> 604.24]  and iOS 13
[604.24 --> 604.90]  or something like that,
[604.94 --> 605.22]  it'd be like,
[605.30 --> 605.82]  yeah, these look
[605.82 --> 606.56]  totally different.
[606.84 --> 607.80]  But if you just gave me
[607.80 --> 609.28]  any two back to back
[609.28 --> 610.30]  other than maybe
[610.30 --> 612.02]  when they changed
[612.02 --> 613.90]  like the camera app
[613.90 --> 615.88]  from like the old one
[615.88 --> 617.66]  that was like a photo booth
[617.66 --> 618.62]  or like an old style camera,
[618.66 --> 619.38]  I forget what it used
[619.38 --> 619.88]  to look like,
[619.92 --> 621.08]  but it's like really different.
[623.06 --> 623.48]  You know,
[623.50 --> 624.74]  if you gave me like those two,
[624.82 --> 625.74]  I'd probably notice it.
[625.76 --> 626.52]  But most of the time,
[626.54 --> 627.82]  it's just not the kind of thing
[627.82 --> 628.64]  that jumps out to me.
[628.96 --> 629.60]  So Jonathan-
[629.60 --> 630.28]  I'm fine with Apple.
[630.72 --> 631.36]  There was a,
[631.52 --> 632.74]  sorry to interject really quick
[632.74 --> 634.32]  in terms of Apple design though.
[634.40 --> 635.14]  I watched a video
[635.14 --> 636.22]  relatively recently.
[636.30 --> 636.76]  I don't even remember
[636.76 --> 637.80]  what the core topic was,
[637.92 --> 639.28]  but one of the concepts
[639.28 --> 639.96]  that they brought up
[639.96 --> 641.08]  was talking about
[641.08 --> 642.64]  old car manufacturing
[642.64 --> 644.22]  and how like Ford's
[644.22 --> 645.36]  original vision was like,
[645.36 --> 646.68]  you can have any color
[646.68 --> 648.78]  you want as long as it's black.
[648.94 --> 650.64]  And like every car
[650.64 --> 651.12]  that they sold
[651.12 --> 651.88]  was supposed to last
[651.88 --> 653.42]  for like a super long time
[653.42 --> 653.74]  and it was supposed
[653.74 --> 654.46]  to be super generic.
[654.58 --> 655.20]  So it was really easy
[655.20 --> 655.90]  to repair and all this
[655.90 --> 656.32]  kind of stuff.
[656.58 --> 657.80]  And then I don't remember
[657.80 --> 658.10]  which,
[658.18 --> 659.52]  but a competing car manufacturer
[659.52 --> 661.64]  hired a new director
[661.64 --> 662.08]  or whatever.
[662.44 --> 663.28]  And they went in
[663.28 --> 663.84]  a new direction.
[663.92 --> 664.48]  That new direction
[664.48 --> 665.26]  was coming out
[665.26 --> 666.48]  with a new set of colors
[666.48 --> 667.08]  every year.
[667.34 --> 667.74]  Yeah.
[668.40 --> 670.46]  And slightly changing
[670.46 --> 671.92]  design elements
[671.92 --> 672.78]  that didn't matter.
[674.12 --> 675.28]  So they would like,
[675.36 --> 676.60]  they'd round all the edges
[676.60 --> 677.88]  and the next year
[677.88 --> 679.02]  or two years later
[679.02 --> 679.30]  or something,
[679.38 --> 680.42]  all the edges would be hard.
[680.64 --> 681.04]  Yeah.
[681.52 --> 682.48]  And then like three
[682.48 --> 683.24]  or four years later,
[683.32 --> 684.56]  they'd round all the edges again.
[685.10 --> 685.66]  And then like three
[685.66 --> 686.38]  or four years later,
[686.48 --> 687.38]  they'd bring,
[687.58 --> 688.26]  okay, yeah, yeah.
[688.40 --> 689.96]  They'd bring the colors back.
[690.18 --> 690.60]  So like it's,
[691.10 --> 692.96]  Apple's very similar
[692.96 --> 693.64]  and they,
[693.98 --> 695.20]  whatever video that was,
[695.56 --> 696.44]  I don't remember,
[696.58 --> 696.84]  sorry.
[697.54 --> 698.24]  Whoever it was,
[698.28 --> 698.96]  he did a great job.
[699.32 --> 699.52]  But,
[699.84 --> 702.02]  it was Veritasium apparently.
[702.70 --> 703.38]  Okay, cool.
[703.58 --> 703.70]  Yeah.
[703.70 --> 704.00]  It was great.
[704.06 --> 704.74]  Oh, good job.
[704.94 --> 705.06]  Yeah.
[705.98 --> 707.32]  Apple does the same thing.
[707.66 --> 708.08]  So they,
[708.28 --> 709.98]  they make all the edges hard
[709.98 --> 710.90]  and they round them.
[711.26 --> 712.44]  Then they change the colors
[712.44 --> 713.18]  and they change the colors
[713.18 --> 713.98]  back to something
[713.98 --> 714.64]  that they released
[714.64 --> 715.36]  three or four years ago.
[715.48 --> 715.70]  It's just,
[715.96 --> 716.34]  I don't know.
[717.08 --> 717.40]  Yeah.
[717.40 --> 717.84]  So,
[717.96 --> 718.22]  oh,
[718.24 --> 719.88]  and it was skeuomorphism
[719.88 --> 721.14]  to what was it?
[721.22 --> 721.62]  Parallax?
[721.68 --> 722.58]  Someone told me in the,
[722.64 --> 723.12]  in the chat.
[723.22 --> 723.98]  So there you go.
[724.36 --> 725.00]  So anyway,
[725.18 --> 726.48]  what will the channel be about?
[726.56 --> 727.94]  I'm so glad you guys asked.
[728.16 --> 729.96]  So Jonathan's going to cover
[729.96 --> 731.24]  everything from,
[731.30 --> 731.64]  you know,
[731.70 --> 732.68]  forward looking,
[733.00 --> 734.94]  addressing rumors,
[735.40 --> 736.80]  kind of content
[736.80 --> 739.02]  to looking back at the past
[739.02 --> 739.46]  and,
[739.78 --> 739.94]  you know,
[739.94 --> 740.60]  talking about,
[740.70 --> 740.86]  you know,
[740.86 --> 741.96]  where's Apple come from?
[742.08 --> 742.54]  How has,
[742.92 --> 744.18]  how has this product line
[744.18 --> 745.40]  or this concept
[745.40 --> 746.50]  developed over time?
[746.50 --> 747.82]  He'll be looking at
[747.82 --> 748.92]  news that develops
[748.92 --> 749.86]  in the Apple world
[749.86 --> 750.78]  that's kind of specific
[750.78 --> 751.84]  to the Apple world.
[752.20 --> 752.40]  You know,
[752.42 --> 753.04]  for example,
[753.24 --> 754.10]  one of the videos
[754.10 --> 755.78]  that we worked on a draft of
[755.78 --> 756.76]  over the last few months,
[756.76 --> 758.54]  but I don't think this one
[758.54 --> 759.26]  ever actually got
[759.26 --> 760.46]  a finalized script
[760.46 --> 761.74]  because we didn't launch
[761.74 --> 762.64]  the channel yet
[762.64 --> 763.98]  and it was kind of
[763.98 --> 765.04]  developing pretty quickly.
[765.04 --> 765.84]  But there was a thing
[765.84 --> 767.66]  where Mac SSDs
[767.66 --> 769.82]  were unnecessarily writing
[769.82 --> 771.80]  or Mac OS
[771.80 --> 773.10]  was unnecessarily writing
[773.10 --> 774.04]  to the boot SSD
[774.04 --> 775.34]  causing it to potentially
[775.34 --> 776.14]  wear out faster
[776.14 --> 776.62]  over time
[776.62 --> 777.32]  and there were some,
[777.32 --> 778.00]  some fixes
[778.00 --> 779.16]  that you could apply yourself
[779.16 --> 779.92]  until I think Apple
[779.92 --> 781.32]  has ultimately fixed it
[781.32 --> 782.08]  on their own now.
[782.20 --> 783.50]  But that's the kind of stuff
[783.50 --> 784.40]  that we'd love to cover.
[784.52 --> 785.90]  So little like tips and tricks,
[786.38 --> 787.42]  product reviews.
[788.16 --> 788.56]  Basically,
[788.56 --> 790.16]  they've got a carte blanche
[790.16 --> 791.32]  in terms of,
[791.32 --> 791.74]  you know,
[792.10 --> 794.68]  acquiring Apple devices
[794.68 --> 796.18]  because a lot of the time
[796.18 --> 797.46]  there's extra use
[797.46 --> 798.24]  that we can get out
[798.24 --> 799.08]  of those same devices
[799.08 --> 799.86]  over on LTT.
[800.48 --> 800.58]  You know,
[800.62 --> 801.16]  for example,
[801.16 --> 802.56]  if Mac address
[802.56 --> 804.44]  wants to do an unboxing
[804.44 --> 805.30]  or,
[805.50 --> 805.86]  you know,
[805.94 --> 806.18]  it's,
[806.28 --> 807.62]  probably unboxing
[807.62 --> 808.80]  wouldn't make as much sense
[808.80 --> 809.34]  on Mac address,
[809.50 --> 810.78]  but if they wanted to do
[810.78 --> 812.72]  some kind of initial impressions
[812.72 --> 814.00]  on the announcement,
[814.32 --> 815.80]  then it hits our dock,
[815.90 --> 817.30]  short circuit unboxes it,
[817.30 --> 818.18]  then Mac address
[818.18 --> 819.52]  can do,
[819.88 --> 821.50]  our LTT can do like a review
[821.50 --> 822.32]  and then Mac address
[822.32 --> 823.12]  can do like the,
[823.22 --> 824.40]  the three months later,
[824.54 --> 825.60]  actually daily driving
[825.60 --> 827.10]  this thing as an Apple user.
[827.10 --> 828.32]  That way we can make sure
[828.32 --> 829.72]  that every one of our properties
[829.72 --> 831.74]  is contributing something
[831.74 --> 833.18]  distinctly different
[833.18 --> 833.78]  to the coverage
[833.78 --> 834.56]  of that product,
[834.66 --> 835.92]  but all getting benefit
[835.92 --> 836.34]  out of it,
[836.38 --> 837.12]  which really helps
[837.12 --> 839.14]  from a business standpoint,
[839.36 --> 840.68]  absorb the cost
[840.68 --> 842.32]  of acquiring Apple products
[842.32 --> 843.68]  because they are not cheap
[843.68 --> 844.24]  and particularly
[844.24 --> 845.50]  with a channel this small,
[845.70 --> 846.64]  it would normally be
[846.64 --> 847.68]  extremely difficult
[847.68 --> 848.76]  for them to just go out
[848.76 --> 850.78]  and buy every Apple product
[850.78 --> 851.66]  unless they're,
[851.78 --> 852.02]  you know,
[852.04 --> 852.78]  a trust fund kid
[852.78 --> 853.48]  or whatever else
[853.48 --> 854.78]  and it just doesn't really matter
[854.78 --> 855.60]  and their YouTube channel
[855.60 --> 856.06]  is a hobby
[856.06 --> 858.04]  until it finally pops off
[858.04 --> 859.28]  after a few years of toil
[859.28 --> 860.42]  or whatever the case may be.
[860.72 --> 861.82]  So that's the,
[862.04 --> 863.86]  that's kind of the concept for it.
[864.10 --> 865.50]  I think he did
[865.50 --> 867.32]  an absolutely great job
[867.32 --> 868.38]  of the kickoff video.
[868.38 --> 869.74]  It sort of talks about
[869.74 --> 871.52]  some of the great features
[871.52 --> 874.02]  of Apple's iCloud keychain,
[874.48 --> 875.02]  you know,
[875.04 --> 875.86]  what's good about it,
[875.92 --> 877.16]  how it's really easy to use.
[877.48 --> 879.08]  One of the flaws in it,
[879.12 --> 880.10]  which is that it can actually
[880.10 --> 881.76]  be a huge security problem.
[881.94 --> 882.36]  Oh yeah.
[883.06 --> 884.46]  Because it only uses
[884.46 --> 885.62]  a single factor
[885.62 --> 886.32]  for authentication
[886.32 --> 887.44]  rather than two.
[889.28 --> 890.00]  And yeah,
[890.04 --> 890.82]  there is something
[890.82 --> 891.54]  that our community
[891.54 --> 892.84]  was a little upset
[892.84 --> 894.34]  that he didn't address,
[894.60 --> 896.40]  but this actually
[896.40 --> 898.52]  is a perfect transition
[898.52 --> 899.96]  to talking about
[899.96 --> 901.74]  what's going to be
[901.74 --> 903.18]  a little bit different
[903.18 --> 904.30]  about this channel.
[904.60 --> 905.16]  Like,
[905.62 --> 906.26]  guys,
[906.54 --> 907.98]  I get it.
[908.26 --> 909.42]  You want to hear about,
[909.56 --> 910.62]  you want to hear us talk about,
[911.28 --> 911.64]  you know,
[911.64 --> 914.48]  self-hosted password managers,
[914.70 --> 914.96]  you know,
[915.48 --> 917.38]  why didn't you talk about
[917.38 --> 918.56]  Bitwarden?
[919.00 --> 919.36]  You know,
[919.46 --> 920.72]  I'm running Bitwarden
[920.72 --> 922.76]  in a Docker container
[922.76 --> 924.04]  and it's so easy.
[924.16 --> 924.78]  And it's like,
[925.90 --> 926.64]  okay,
[927.30 --> 929.04]  that ain't the audience,
[929.20 --> 929.82]  ladies and gentlemen.
[930.46 --> 930.62]  Like,
[930.80 --> 932.06]  you've got to understand
[932.06 --> 933.38]  one of the challenges
[933.38 --> 935.12]  for Linus Tech Tips
[935.12 --> 935.76]  and honestly,
[936.06 --> 938.52]  for our channels in general,
[938.52 --> 939.96]  and I'll see these comments
[939.96 --> 940.62]  all the time.
[941.04 --> 941.20]  Yeah,
[941.22 --> 942.04]  I really like this guy.
[942.10 --> 943.16]  He's got so much energy
[943.16 --> 943.94]  and they're always doing
[943.94 --> 944.48]  cool stuff,
[944.54 --> 945.14]  but I don't understand
[945.14 --> 945.64]  half the things
[945.64 --> 946.16]  he's talking about.
[947.18 --> 948.58]  And for those of you
[948.58 --> 949.58]  in our audience
[949.58 --> 951.30]  who are running Unraid
[951.30 --> 952.54]  and your own Plex servers
[952.54 --> 953.90]  and all this kind of stuff,
[954.24 --> 954.82]  to you,
[955.06 --> 956.58]  it might seem like,
[957.10 --> 957.78]  you know,
[957.82 --> 958.96]  some kind of
[958.96 --> 961.28]  mental deficiency
[961.28 --> 963.10]  that someone doesn't just
[963.10 --> 964.72]  roll their own Plex server
[964.72 --> 965.76]  and roll their own
[965.76 --> 966.62]  password manager
[966.62 --> 968.08]  and run Home Assistant
[968.08 --> 969.66]  on their home server
[969.66 --> 970.98]  to bridge together
[970.98 --> 971.94]  all of their different
[971.94 --> 973.56]  smart home ecosystems
[973.56 --> 974.78]  so they can interact with each other.
[974.98 --> 976.52]  Why isn't everybody doing this?
[977.30 --> 979.08]  Because they don't want to.
[979.80 --> 981.30]  Most people don't care.
[981.68 --> 982.98]  Most people would rather
[982.98 --> 983.82]  spend their time
[983.82 --> 985.04]  trying out a new recipe
[985.04 --> 986.82]  than figuring out
[986.82 --> 987.90]  how to run a Plex server
[987.90 --> 988.70]  and they'll just
[988.70 --> 990.00]  pay for Netflix.
[990.68 --> 990.92]  Actually,
[991.00 --> 991.62]  very similar
[991.62 --> 992.76]  kind of activities
[992.76 --> 993.28]  in a way.
[994.24 --> 994.76]  Exactly.
[994.94 --> 995.42]  Exactly.
[995.62 --> 996.42]  So in the same way
[996.42 --> 997.68]  that you might subsist
[997.68 --> 999.20]  on ramen noodles
[999.20 --> 1000.76]  and save a lot of money
[1000.76 --> 1001.54]  on movies,
[1002.26 --> 1003.90]  they might subsist on,
[1004.02 --> 1004.60]  I don't know,
[1004.86 --> 1006.08]  better food
[1006.08 --> 1007.58]  and pay for movies.
[1007.80 --> 1008.42]  You know what I mean?
[1008.48 --> 1009.00]  Everyone's got
[1009.00 --> 1009.70]  different priorities
[1009.70 --> 1010.52]  and we've all only got
[1010.52 --> 1011.64]  24 hours in a day.
[1012.18 --> 1014.38]  And we think,
[1014.68 --> 1015.86]  and we'll find out
[1015.86 --> 1016.70]  if this is true,
[1016.90 --> 1018.10]  we think that
[1018.10 --> 1018.78]  taking,
[1018.78 --> 1021.88]  taking more of a
[1021.88 --> 1023.62]  mainstream approach
[1023.62 --> 1025.26]  to the MAC address channel
[1025.26 --> 1026.52]  is likely to be
[1026.52 --> 1027.14]  more successful,
[1027.26 --> 1028.42]  which is one of the reasons
[1028.42 --> 1029.62]  that I have
[1029.62 --> 1032.50]  not quite fully
[1032.50 --> 1034.28]  recused myself
[1034.28 --> 1035.48]  when it comes to
[1035.48 --> 1036.86]  editorial decisions
[1036.86 --> 1037.66]  or,
[1037.98 --> 1038.34]  okay,
[1038.62 --> 1040.00]  I've recused myself
[1040.00 --> 1040.80]  when it comes to
[1040.80 --> 1041.64]  decisions,
[1041.64 --> 1042.84]  but I haven't quite
[1042.84 --> 1043.96]  removed myself
[1043.96 --> 1045.16]  from the editorial process,
[1045.16 --> 1046.20]  but I have mostly
[1046.20 --> 1047.38]  pulled back
[1047.38 --> 1048.82]  because I have a tendency
[1048.82 --> 1050.76]  to over explain
[1050.76 --> 1051.52]  or get into
[1051.52 --> 1052.36]  too much
[1052.36 --> 1054.14]  technical depth.
[1054.40 --> 1055.00]  So sometimes
[1055.00 --> 1056.26]  I'll watch videos
[1056.26 --> 1057.68]  from other YouTubers
[1057.68 --> 1058.88]  that have like
[1058.88 --> 1061.18]  five or ten million views
[1061.18 --> 1061.98]  and I'm looking at them
[1061.98 --> 1062.36]  going like,
[1062.42 --> 1062.72]  I sit,
[1062.82 --> 1063.76]  I watch the whole thing
[1063.76 --> 1064.22]  and I'm like,
[1064.62 --> 1067.04]  this was literally nothing.
[1067.58 --> 1069.68]  This was entirely fluff
[1069.68 --> 1070.88]  that anyone who has
[1070.88 --> 1071.90]  two functioning eyes
[1071.90 --> 1072.94]  and an internet connection
[1072.94 --> 1073.84]  should already know.
[1075.18 --> 1076.26]  And that's
[1076.26 --> 1077.94]  really destructive
[1077.94 --> 1078.94]  sometimes
[1078.94 --> 1080.26]  to allowing us
[1080.26 --> 1081.12]  to broaden our reach
[1081.12 --> 1081.62]  as a company
[1081.62 --> 1082.44]  because sometimes
[1082.44 --> 1084.36]  I don't even realize
[1084.36 --> 1085.96]  what people
[1085.96 --> 1087.22]  want to know.
[1087.40 --> 1087.72]  I just,
[1087.80 --> 1089.36]  I just completely miss it.
[1089.60 --> 1089.76]  You know,
[1089.84 --> 1091.04]  today Anthony wrote
[1091.04 --> 1092.32]  and I hosted a video
[1092.32 --> 1093.24]  on NVIDIA's
[1093.24 --> 1094.36]  Code 43 error,
[1094.80 --> 1095.96]  which comes up
[1095.96 --> 1097.02]  if you try and install
[1097.02 --> 1099.06]  a driver on a GeForce GPU
[1099.06 --> 1100.28]  within a virtual machine.
[1100.50 --> 1101.24]  And it's something
[1101.24 --> 1102.18]  we're making a video about
[1102.18 --> 1103.92]  because I'm really excited
[1103.92 --> 1105.74]  that NVIDIA has finally
[1105.74 --> 1106.76]  removed that limitation
[1106.76 --> 1108.00]  and allows you
[1108.00 --> 1109.46]  without any stupid workarounds
[1109.46 --> 1110.70]  to pass through a GPU
[1110.70 --> 1112.02]  to a VM.
[1113.50 --> 1114.38]  Most people
[1114.38 --> 1115.78]  don't need
[1115.78 --> 1116.92]  or even want
[1116.92 --> 1117.68]  that functionality
[1117.68 --> 1118.60]  in their life
[1118.60 --> 1119.96]  and that kind of video
[1119.96 --> 1120.80]  is the one
[1120.80 --> 1121.40]  where people are going
[1121.40 --> 1121.70]  to be like,
[1121.80 --> 1121.94]  yeah,
[1122.02 --> 1122.46]  I'm super,
[1122.56 --> 1123.26]  I consider myself
[1123.26 --> 1123.92]  super techie
[1123.92 --> 1125.84]  but I had no idea
[1125.84 --> 1126.68]  what you were talking about
[1126.68 --> 1128.06]  with IOMU groups
[1128.06 --> 1131.26]  and PCI device pass through
[1131.26 --> 1132.74]  and all that kind of stuff.
[1132.74 --> 1133.94]  And so you got to understand
[1133.94 --> 1135.04]  there's different kinds
[1135.04 --> 1135.58]  of techie.
[1136.18 --> 1136.58]  Like there's,
[1136.70 --> 1137.14]  like Luke,
[1137.24 --> 1138.22]  you see this a lot
[1138.22 --> 1139.16]  because you interview
[1139.16 --> 1140.00]  a lot of developers.
[1140.62 --> 1141.54]  Talk about the difference
[1141.54 --> 1142.92]  between software techie
[1142.92 --> 1143.90]  and hardware techie.
[1144.30 --> 1144.68]  Oh yeah.
[1145.32 --> 1148.72]  I actually often really like
[1148.72 --> 1149.86]  when people are hardware techie
[1149.86 --> 1151.16]  because I find that
[1151.16 --> 1152.02]  those people,
[1152.54 --> 1153.42]  I don't know if other people
[1153.42 --> 1153.88]  have found this,
[1153.92 --> 1154.66]  this would be pretty interesting
[1154.66 --> 1155.52]  if there's any recruiters
[1155.52 --> 1155.90]  in the audience,
[1155.98 --> 1157.04]  but those people are often
[1157.04 --> 1158.96]  more self-driven
[1158.96 --> 1160.24]  and better at working
[1160.24 --> 1161.00]  on their own.
[1162.74 --> 1163.70]  than others
[1163.70 --> 1165.30]  because that usually means
[1165.30 --> 1166.06]  that they work on
[1166.06 --> 1167.02]  a very large amount
[1167.02 --> 1168.52]  of projects at home.
[1168.68 --> 1169.46]  I have found
[1169.46 --> 1170.44]  that more people
[1170.44 --> 1171.22]  that are into
[1171.22 --> 1173.62]  little bits of development
[1173.62 --> 1174.30]  for hardware
[1174.30 --> 1175.52]  will do more
[1175.52 --> 1176.38]  at home development.
[1176.58 --> 1177.16]  I don't know why,
[1177.58 --> 1177.92]  it just,
[1178.88 --> 1180.28]  I've seen it trend that way.
[1180.34 --> 1180.60]  But yeah,
[1180.68 --> 1182.12]  there's a really big difference.
[1182.88 --> 1184.34]  Even in the development space,
[1184.38 --> 1185.36]  if you're looking
[1185.36 --> 1186.84]  at extremely surface level,
[1187.20 --> 1188.24]  you see two people
[1188.24 --> 1190.30]  that type at a computer
[1190.30 --> 1191.66]  and work with servers
[1191.66 --> 1192.24]  and you're like,
[1192.32 --> 1192.50]  cool,
[1192.58 --> 1193.54]  I found two developers
[1193.54 --> 1194.10]  and it's like,
[1194.18 --> 1194.38]  okay,
[1194.46 --> 1194.62]  yeah,
[1194.70 --> 1194.90]  well,
[1195.26 --> 1195.90]  if you try to make
[1195.90 --> 1196.48]  one of them
[1196.48 --> 1197.70]  make the,
[1197.70 --> 1198.56]  make the,
[1199.34 --> 1200.22]  what you use
[1200.22 --> 1200.78]  on a website,
[1200.96 --> 1201.46]  the front end
[1201.46 --> 1202.02]  on a website,
[1202.50 --> 1203.44]  they might be
[1203.44 --> 1204.34]  an infrastructure person
[1204.34 --> 1205.18]  and it might be
[1205.18 --> 1206.66]  absolutely freaking terrible.
[1207.86 --> 1208.62]  You need,
[1208.66 --> 1210.18]  you need different people
[1210.18 --> 1211.00]  for different things
[1211.00 --> 1211.66]  and they are actually
[1211.66 --> 1212.62]  very different people
[1212.62 --> 1213.30]  for different things.
[1213.90 --> 1214.02]  Yeah,
[1214.08 --> 1214.52]  absolutely.
[1214.52 --> 1216.22]  And the thing is like,
[1216.50 --> 1216.88]  you know,
[1217.02 --> 1219.40]  some people can be
[1219.40 --> 1220.70]  super techie
[1220.70 --> 1221.68]  in the sense that
[1221.68 --> 1222.16]  they,
[1222.64 --> 1224.68]  they're really excited
[1224.68 --> 1225.98]  about new gadgets
[1225.98 --> 1227.28]  and they go out
[1227.28 --> 1228.62]  and they get them
[1228.62 --> 1229.88]  and they try them
[1229.88 --> 1231.72]  and those people,
[1232.02 --> 1232.32]  yeah,
[1232.40 --> 1233.68]  those people are techie
[1233.68 --> 1234.78]  in a way that I,
[1234.94 --> 1235.48]  for example,
[1235.60 --> 1236.16]  am not.
[1236.28 --> 1237.52]  Like if I sat down,
[1237.62 --> 1237.82]  okay,
[1237.84 --> 1239.06]  if I tried to join
[1239.06 --> 1241.00]  a home automation podcast
[1241.00 --> 1241.82]  as a guest,
[1241.90 --> 1242.42]  for example,
[1242.42 --> 1244.24]  I would probably sound
[1244.24 --> 1245.40]  like a complete
[1245.40 --> 1246.22]  know-nothing,
[1246.62 --> 1248.54]  like Luddite,
[1248.76 --> 1249.80]  just a complete
[1249.80 --> 1251.18]  non-techie idiot
[1251.18 --> 1253.10]  because I don't use
[1253.10 --> 1253.58]  the stuff
[1253.58 --> 1254.86]  because I just
[1254.86 --> 1256.44]  don't care.
[1257.30 --> 1257.80]  Linux nerds.
[1257.96 --> 1258.78]  And then meanwhile,
[1258.96 --> 1259.08]  oh,
[1259.10 --> 1259.84]  that's another one.
[1259.92 --> 1260.56]  That's another one.
[1260.70 --> 1260.88]  I mean,
[1260.90 --> 1261.10]  man,
[1261.18 --> 1261.74]  float plane people
[1261.74 --> 1262.28]  are going to know
[1262.28 --> 1263.50]  because they already saw
[1263.50 --> 1265.02]  our tech trivia
[1265.02 --> 1265.82]  answered in the form
[1265.82 --> 1266.64]  of a question thing
[1266.64 --> 1267.12]  where I knew
[1267.12 --> 1267.96]  absolutely nothing
[1267.96 --> 1269.04]  about hacking in Linux
[1269.04 --> 1270.02]  because it's just not,
[1270.12 --> 1270.96]  it's not a part
[1270.96 --> 1271.78]  of my day-to-day life.
[1271.78 --> 1273.06]  Back to the home automation
[1273.06 --> 1274.18]  example for a moment though.
[1274.24 --> 1274.80]  This is great.
[1275.42 --> 1276.92]  So I was determined.
[1277.08 --> 1277.50]  I was like,
[1277.58 --> 1277.84]  look,
[1277.96 --> 1278.28]  I'm just,
[1278.42 --> 1279.18]  I'm going to do this.
[1279.32 --> 1279.52]  I,
[1279.72 --> 1280.88]  it's not like I don't have
[1280.88 --> 1282.04]  the basic skills
[1282.04 --> 1283.16]  to change out a light switch
[1283.16 --> 1283.66]  in my house.
[1283.66 --> 1284.52]  So I'm going to change
[1284.52 --> 1285.50]  all my light switches
[1285.50 --> 1286.62]  for smart switches.
[1286.62 --> 1287.22]  So I went
[1287.22 --> 1288.12]  and I got whatever
[1288.12 --> 1290.06]  the like ballin awesome one
[1290.06 --> 1291.24]  is from Lutron,
[1291.40 --> 1292.08]  their Caseta,
[1292.22 --> 1293.58]  Caseta line or whatever.
[1294.08 --> 1295.32]  And I installed one of them
[1295.32 --> 1296.08]  in the kids room
[1296.08 --> 1297.36]  and it was supposed
[1297.36 --> 1298.00]  to be really cool
[1298.00 --> 1299.52]  because what you can do
[1299.52 --> 1300.34]  with smart switches
[1300.34 --> 1301.92]  is for example,
[1301.92 --> 1303.36]  you can turn two lights
[1303.36 --> 1304.62]  on and off at the same time,
[1304.62 --> 1305.30]  even if they're not
[1305.30 --> 1306.20]  on a three-way switch
[1306.20 --> 1306.70]  or if they're not
[1306.70 --> 1307.48]  connected in any way.
[1307.54 --> 1308.34]  So there's lots of things
[1308.34 --> 1309.34]  that even though
[1309.34 --> 1310.08]  I haven't reached
[1310.08 --> 1310.78]  the point in my life
[1310.78 --> 1311.54]  where I can't get up
[1311.54 --> 1312.08]  off my butt
[1312.08 --> 1313.20]  and press a light switch,
[1313.66 --> 1315.16]  there would be
[1315.16 --> 1316.56]  useful functionality
[1316.56 --> 1317.58]  because like my kids room,
[1317.66 --> 1318.14]  for example,
[1318.28 --> 1319.32]  it used to be two rooms.
[1319.76 --> 1320.62]  We ripped out the wall
[1320.62 --> 1321.16]  in between
[1321.16 --> 1322.36]  and made it
[1322.36 --> 1323.24]  the mega room
[1323.24 --> 1324.58]  with like a built-in bunk bed
[1324.58 --> 1325.14]  on one side.
[1325.18 --> 1325.80]  So they have more room
[1325.80 --> 1326.22]  to play.
[1326.58 --> 1327.32]  But that means
[1327.32 --> 1328.10]  that the two lights
[1328.10 --> 1328.58]  in the room
[1328.58 --> 1330.02]  are like way far apart
[1330.02 --> 1330.58]  and they're on two
[1330.58 --> 1331.44]  completely different switches.
[1331.56 --> 1331.90]  So I was like,
[1331.94 --> 1332.46]  oh, that's great.
[1332.50 --> 1333.16]  I'll just go ahead.
[1333.20 --> 1334.24]  I'll put the smart switches in.
[1334.28 --> 1335.10]  I'll configure the thing.
[1335.18 --> 1335.68]  We'll have the button.
[1337.62 --> 1338.62]  After spending,
[1338.76 --> 1339.16]  you know,
[1339.20 --> 1341.00]  63 Canadian dollars
[1341.00 --> 1342.04]  or whatever it was
[1342.04 --> 1343.46]  for this light switch,
[1344.24 --> 1346.14]  I just couldn't bring myself,
[1346.36 --> 1347.84]  even though I make enough money
[1347.84 --> 1348.70]  that I really could
[1348.70 --> 1350.18]  just buy smart switches
[1350.18 --> 1351.00]  for my house
[1351.00 --> 1351.90]  if I really wanted to,
[1352.28 --> 1353.20]  I couldn't bring myself
[1353.20 --> 1354.30]  to buy any more of them
[1354.30 --> 1355.74]  because the quality
[1355.74 --> 1357.60]  of the switches
[1357.60 --> 1359.24]  in the buttons
[1359.24 --> 1361.02]  was so poor
[1361.02 --> 1362.42]  that it offended me
[1362.42 --> 1363.00]  to the point
[1363.00 --> 1363.82]  where I actually
[1363.82 --> 1364.80]  just didn't care
[1364.80 --> 1366.04]  how good the smart
[1366.04 --> 1367.16]  openness of it was.
[1367.58 --> 1368.68]  They're so mushy
[1368.68 --> 1369.88]  and awful to press
[1369.88 --> 1371.12]  that I would honestly
[1371.12 --> 1372.22]  rather put my crappy
[1372.22 --> 1373.26]  dumb switch back in
[1373.26 --> 1374.40]  because in the dark,
[1374.52 --> 1375.18]  I can't even,
[1375.70 --> 1376.60]  there's no tactile
[1376.60 --> 1377.52]  feeling to it.
[1377.74 --> 1378.30]  Like the fact
[1378.30 --> 1379.06]  that they over,
[1379.14 --> 1379.84]  like this is what
[1379.84 --> 1380.62]  makes me so mad.
[1380.84 --> 1381.70]  Remember when early
[1381.70 --> 1383.24]  smartphones were great
[1383.24 --> 1383.96]  at being smart
[1383.96 --> 1384.58]  and terrible
[1384.58 --> 1385.38]  at being phones?
[1386.32 --> 1387.50]  So these smart switches
[1387.50 --> 1388.98]  are great at being smart
[1388.98 --> 1389.84]  and they're terrible
[1389.84 --> 1391.38]  at just being a light switch.
[1391.62 --> 1392.94]  I can't feel for it
[1392.94 --> 1393.68]  in the dark.
[1394.06 --> 1394.50]  It's like,
[1394.56 --> 1395.90]  it's mushy and garbage.
[1396.02 --> 1397.16]  They have no stabilization
[1397.16 --> 1397.90]  on the button
[1397.90 --> 1399.00]  whatsoever.
[1399.42 --> 1400.62]  So they've overlooked
[1400.62 --> 1403.24]  this just blatantly
[1403.24 --> 1404.64]  obvious thing to me
[1404.64 --> 1406.76]  as admittedly
[1406.76 --> 1409.16]  more of a hardware nerd
[1409.16 --> 1410.88]  and less of like a,
[1410.88 --> 1412.20]  you know,
[1412.28 --> 1412.78]  cloud,
[1413.16 --> 1413.48]  you know,
[1413.52 --> 1414.38]  lifestyle.
[1416.06 --> 1416.50]  Yeah,
[1416.58 --> 1417.94]  Linus the switch snob
[1417.94 --> 1418.74]  says catering
[1418.74 --> 1419.44]  over a float plane.
[1419.50 --> 1419.64]  No,
[1419.66 --> 1420.30]  but that's the thing
[1420.30 --> 1421.24]  and I think that would
[1421.24 --> 1422.56]  also probably relate to,
[1422.68 --> 1423.54]  I'm sure you get
[1423.54 --> 1425.68]  one of my biggest pet peeves
[1425.68 --> 1427.18]  in consumer electronics
[1427.18 --> 1428.00]  and also,
[1428.40 --> 1429.02]  especially when you,
[1429.06 --> 1429.90]  when you like go out
[1429.90 --> 1430.34]  somewhere,
[1430.50 --> 1431.74]  especially if you need to,
[1432.24 --> 1433.14]  if you're going to an event
[1433.14 --> 1433.84]  and there's a terminal
[1433.84 --> 1434.40]  of some kind
[1434.40 --> 1435.88]  is really bad,
[1436.46 --> 1438.50]  especially non-screen based
[1438.50 --> 1439.74]  touch controls.
[1440.24 --> 1442.64]  I find non-screen based
[1442.64 --> 1443.32]  touch controls
[1443.32 --> 1444.88]  are often way worse even.
[1445.22 --> 1446.10]  They're just incredibly
[1446.10 --> 1446.86]  frustrating to use.
[1446.96 --> 1448.14]  There's like no user feedback.
[1448.34 --> 1448.88]  You have no idea
[1448.88 --> 1449.60]  if the thing you're pressing
[1449.60 --> 1450.14]  is working.
[1450.34 --> 1451.06]  It's often hooked
[1451.06 --> 1452.46]  into some like Dell
[1452.46 --> 1453.26]  that's been sitting
[1453.26 --> 1456.18]  in this like air choked box
[1456.18 --> 1457.38]  for like six years
[1457.38 --> 1458.58]  and is somehow still alive.
[1458.60 --> 1458.90]  The air gap between
[1458.90 --> 1459.96]  the front glass
[1459.96 --> 1461.68]  and the actual panel behind
[1461.68 --> 1463.50]  is like half a centimeter.
[1463.74 --> 1464.20]  So if you're,
[1464.20 --> 1465.70]  standing off axis,
[1465.90 --> 1467.04]  you actually can't tell
[1467.04 --> 1467.62]  if you're aligned
[1467.62 --> 1468.34]  with the button.
[1469.02 --> 1470.68]  It's just so annoying.
[1470.80 --> 1471.86]  That stuff like actually
[1471.86 --> 1473.68]  genuinely infuriates me,
[1473.96 --> 1474.78]  but then they're like,
[1474.98 --> 1475.70]  no one else seems
[1475.70 --> 1476.30]  to really care.
[1476.42 --> 1477.00]  But yeah,
[1477.06 --> 1477.44]  there's,
[1477.50 --> 1478.12]  there's definitely
[1478.12 --> 1480.20]  a very wide variance
[1480.20 --> 1480.64]  of nerds.
[1480.70 --> 1481.70]  Someone in float plane chat
[1481.70 --> 1482.56]  made a comment
[1482.56 --> 1483.96]  a very long time ago,
[1483.96 --> 1484.42]  so I don't remember
[1484.42 --> 1485.46]  the exact wording for it,
[1485.48 --> 1486.14]  but they said something
[1486.14 --> 1487.08]  along the lines of like,
[1487.44 --> 1487.56]  oh,
[1487.64 --> 1488.60]  so it's like content
[1488.60 --> 1489.80]  for normies
[1489.80 --> 1490.98]  or it's like for,
[1491.06 --> 1491.84]  for mass appeal,
[1491.90 --> 1492.64]  I think is what it said.
[1492.92 --> 1494.08]  Not necessarily,
[1494.08 --> 1496.30]  it's just not necessarily
[1496.30 --> 1498.54]  for you
[1498.54 --> 1499.42]  if you're saying that.
[1499.66 --> 1499.86]  Yes.
[1500.26 --> 1501.16]  It might be,
[1501.24 --> 1501.46]  it's,
[1501.46 --> 1502.52]  it's going to be for
[1502.52 --> 1505.08]  a select section of people,
[1505.08 --> 1506.48]  but just like Linus's example
[1506.48 --> 1507.46]  of cooking videos,
[1508.04 --> 1509.64]  I'm staring into my webcam
[1509.64 --> 1510.82]  thing that has a cover on it.
[1510.86 --> 1511.62]  That's completely useless.
[1511.96 --> 1513.50]  Just like Linus's example
[1513.50 --> 1514.48]  of cooking videos,
[1514.84 --> 1516.54]  that's going to be for people
[1516.54 --> 1517.80]  that specifically like cooking.
[1517.90 --> 1518.30]  That doesn't mean
[1518.30 --> 1518.74]  it's necessarily
[1518.74 --> 1519.80]  a normie audience.
[1520.00 --> 1520.92]  You might think it's normie
[1520.92 --> 1521.30]  because it's not
[1521.30 --> 1522.08]  what you're into,
[1522.26 --> 1523.94]  but it's not necessarily normie.
[1524.30 --> 1524.44]  Yeah.
[1524.82 --> 1525.38]  There's,
[1525.58 --> 1525.76]  yeah.
[1525.92 --> 1527.16]  It's for techie people,
[1527.16 --> 1528.28]  but who are more
[1528.28 --> 1531.22]  into lifestyle technology.
[1531.50 --> 1531.72]  And that,
[1531.88 --> 1532.66]  I think that crowd
[1532.66 --> 1533.80]  does tend to skew
[1533.80 --> 1535.22]  more heavily towards Mac
[1535.22 --> 1536.70]  because that's something
[1536.70 --> 1537.64]  that Apple does
[1537.64 --> 1538.82]  a really good job of
[1538.82 --> 1539.44]  is creating
[1539.44 --> 1541.64]  a cohesive environment
[1541.64 --> 1543.08]  where if you're willing
[1543.08 --> 1543.50]  to pay,
[1543.64 --> 1545.50]  everything just works.
[1545.50 --> 1548.44]  except Linus doesn't.
[1549.44 --> 1549.84]  Yeah,
[1549.88 --> 1551.62]  but like you brought up
[1551.62 --> 1553.06]  the design of the icons.
[1553.64 --> 1553.94]  Yeah.
[1554.64 --> 1556.34]  Like maybe there's a video
[1556.34 --> 1557.98]  about that at some point
[1557.98 --> 1559.24]  and maybe the person
[1559.24 --> 1560.02]  who made that comment
[1560.02 --> 1561.10]  isn't going to give a crap
[1561.10 --> 1562.36]  because it's not their thing
[1562.36 --> 1563.58]  or they don't understand
[1563.58 --> 1564.32]  why it matters
[1564.32 --> 1565.42]  because it's not their thing,
[1565.50 --> 1566.40]  but someone else might care.
[1566.48 --> 1567.40]  And back to the design
[1567.40 --> 1567.94]  of the icons,
[1568.06 --> 1568.78]  just because it's not
[1568.78 --> 1569.42]  the kind of thing
[1569.42 --> 1570.72]  that I notice
[1570.72 --> 1571.72]  doesn't mean that
[1571.72 --> 1573.46]  I don't absolutely respect
[1573.46 --> 1574.78]  the people who work on it,
[1574.78 --> 1576.02]  the people who study
[1576.02 --> 1577.56]  that kind of,
[1577.56 --> 1577.84]  you know,
[1577.88 --> 1579.06]  user interaction,
[1579.42 --> 1581.86]  user experience science
[1581.86 --> 1583.82]  because it's art,
[1584.08 --> 1584.34]  yes,
[1584.54 --> 1586.34]  but it is also science.
[1586.34 --> 1587.46]  The way people interact
[1587.46 --> 1588.22]  with their devices,
[1588.58 --> 1589.72]  interact with websites,
[1590.34 --> 1591.94]  there is a lot of,
[1592.00 --> 1592.74]  well, science
[1592.74 --> 1593.98]  and also black magic
[1593.98 --> 1595.22]  to getting that stuff
[1595.22 --> 1595.74]  just right
[1595.74 --> 1596.92]  and I have a ton of respect
[1596.92 --> 1597.46]  for the people
[1597.46 --> 1598.80]  who manage to build interfaces
[1598.80 --> 1601.50]  that look great
[1601.50 --> 1603.34]  and manage to also be functional.
[1603.34 --> 1606.44]  So I'm extremely excited
[1606.44 --> 1607.86]  for the future of this channel.
[1608.12 --> 1609.04]  I think Jonathan
[1609.04 --> 1610.32]  has done a great job.
[1610.44 --> 1611.20]  I think that there is
[1611.20 --> 1611.78]  a possibility
[1611.78 --> 1613.42]  that we will expand the roster
[1613.42 --> 1614.82]  because I think my goal
[1614.82 --> 1617.02]  of two to three videos a week
[1617.02 --> 1618.38]  is going to be very challenging
[1618.38 --> 1619.80]  for just one person to hit.
[1619.80 --> 1622.68]  So, you know,
[1622.76 --> 1623.34]  yeah, guys,
[1623.58 --> 1623.84]  you know,
[1623.88 --> 1624.46]  let us know
[1624.46 --> 1625.24]  if you think
[1625.24 --> 1626.24]  that you're qualified
[1626.24 --> 1628.48]  to run the MAC address
[1628.48 --> 1629.10]  and you're able
[1629.10 --> 1630.16]  to relocate to Vancouver
[1630.16 --> 1633.88]  and you have a current work permit,
[1634.34 --> 1634.66]  okay,
[1634.90 --> 1636.38]  you have the ability
[1636.38 --> 1638.58]  to work in Canada now,
[1638.84 --> 1639.92]  not if you like
[1639.92 --> 1641.46]  think it might be possible
[1641.46 --> 1643.02]  because if you think
[1643.02 --> 1643.92]  it might be possible,
[1644.12 --> 1645.54]  it probably isn't.
[1645.54 --> 1646.46]  So, yeah,
[1646.54 --> 1648.50]  just let us know.
[1649.68 --> 1650.74]  Had a lot of that
[1650.74 --> 1652.36]  in my hiring stuff as well.
[1652.58 --> 1653.76]  I feel like we've gone
[1653.76 --> 1654.78]  through similar experiences.
[1655.24 --> 1655.48]  Okay,
[1655.64 --> 1657.58]  AJ is giving me crap
[1657.58 --> 1658.86]  for my Lutron stuff.
[1658.96 --> 1659.22]  He's like,
[1659.26 --> 1660.44]  going for the Lutron stuff
[1660.44 --> 1661.60]  is the reason people
[1661.60 --> 1662.22]  go for Apple
[1662.22 --> 1662.78]  because they think
[1662.78 --> 1664.00]  expensive means it's good.
[1664.20 --> 1664.98]  Well, okay,
[1665.10 --> 1665.36]  no,
[1665.46 --> 1666.48]  so this is great.
[1666.58 --> 1666.98]  This is actually
[1666.98 --> 1667.88]  a really good conversation.
[1668.04 --> 1669.04]  So I went for it
[1669.04 --> 1670.58]  because based on
[1670.58 --> 1671.92]  the functionality
[1671.92 --> 1672.88]  and based on
[1672.88 --> 1673.76]  the compatibility
[1673.76 --> 1675.02]  with other ecosystems,
[1675.38 --> 1679.14]  it was the most complete option,
[1679.32 --> 1680.14]  was the reason
[1680.14 --> 1681.14]  that I went for it.
[1681.40 --> 1682.50]  It didn't have limitations
[1682.50 --> 1683.78]  in terms of how many devices
[1683.78 --> 1684.62]  you could have
[1684.62 --> 1685.98]  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1686.04 --> 1686.64]  So there were a bunch
[1686.64 --> 1687.74]  of reasons I went for it,
[1688.04 --> 1689.12]  but okay,
[1689.28 --> 1691.22]  you might have said,
[1691.64 --> 1692.04]  oh, well,
[1692.18 --> 1692.84]  those reasons
[1692.84 --> 1693.98]  aren't very meaningful for me
[1693.98 --> 1694.94]  because I don't mind
[1694.94 --> 1696.08]  setting up a Docker container
[1696.08 --> 1696.78]  with Home Assistant
[1696.78 --> 1697.76]  and having everything
[1697.76 --> 1698.78]  interact with each other
[1698.78 --> 1699.26]  that way,
[1699.70 --> 1701.38]  which is totally fair.
[1701.48 --> 1701.78]  Yeah, AJ,
[1701.86 --> 1702.90]  of course I read comments.
[1702.98 --> 1703.28]  What do you think
[1703.28 --> 1704.20]  I'm not reading comments
[1704.20 --> 1704.84]  on the WAN show?
[1704.92 --> 1705.76]  What do you think this is?
[1706.04 --> 1706.16]  Huh?
[1706.66 --> 1707.66]  AJ is one of our devs
[1707.66 --> 1708.24]  over at Flowplane.
[1708.60 --> 1711.52]  So it's just different approaches
[1711.52 --> 1712.44]  to the problem.
[1712.88 --> 1714.12]  And for me,
[1714.38 --> 1715.08]  that solution
[1715.08 --> 1715.72]  is not one
[1715.72 --> 1716.76]  that necessarily makes sense.
[1716.84 --> 1717.92]  Now, since that time,
[1717.96 --> 1718.82]  I have actually set up
[1718.82 --> 1719.30]  Home Assistant,
[1719.52 --> 1720.30]  although I'm only using it
[1720.30 --> 1721.42]  for my garage door for now.
[1721.80 --> 1722.88]  And in the future,
[1723.26 --> 1724.46]  I'm actually moving
[1724.46 --> 1726.04]  in the next few months.
[1726.04 --> 1726.84]  So in the future,
[1726.84 --> 1728.10]  I'm definitely going to try
[1728.10 --> 1728.72]  and figure out
[1728.72 --> 1730.54]  what the end game way
[1730.54 --> 1731.56]  to go about this is.
[1731.56 --> 1733.76]  But for now,
[1733.88 --> 1734.68]  for the time,
[1734.88 --> 1737.30]  that made the most sense to me.
[1739.82 --> 1740.92]  6969X in the chat says,
[1741.04 --> 1742.52]  Pro Automator here.
[1742.62 --> 1743.90]  Lutron is by far
[1743.90 --> 1745.10]  the best lighting control.
[1745.22 --> 1746.06]  Any honest automator
[1746.06 --> 1746.74]  will tell you that,
[1747.08 --> 1748.20]  just not the Caseta line.
[1748.28 --> 1749.30]  Okay, so now we know that,
[1749.36 --> 1750.04]  so that's good to know.
[1750.38 --> 1751.26]  I thought the Caseta one
[1751.26 --> 1752.34]  was more expensive though.
[1752.40 --> 1753.32]  Okay, that I don't remember.
[1753.80 --> 1754.64]  Part of it is that
[1754.64 --> 1756.06]  Amazon.ca's pricing
[1756.06 --> 1757.44]  is like all over the place.
[1757.44 --> 1758.26]  And for whatever reason,
[1758.26 --> 1759.20]  I was on Amazon.
[1759.98 --> 1761.56]  I gotta kick that.
[1761.70 --> 1762.14]  So Luke,
[1762.66 --> 1763.90]  actually, I want to talk about that.
[1763.96 --> 1765.22]  That's not one of our topics today.
[1765.56 --> 1766.82]  But you've been trying
[1766.82 --> 1768.86]  to de-Amazonify your life
[1768.86 --> 1769.70]  for a while now.
[1769.76 --> 1770.32]  How's that going?
[1771.66 --> 1772.22]  Pretty good.
[1772.90 --> 1774.34]  Yeah, I don't buy anything
[1774.34 --> 1774.74]  from Amazon.
[1775.14 --> 1776.02]  That's pretty much it.
[1776.04 --> 1776.50]  What do you do?
[1777.64 --> 1778.58]  It's so convenient.
[1778.88 --> 1779.62]  They've got Prime shipping.
[1779.62 --> 1781.84]  I understand that
[1781.84 --> 1782.82]  they have Prime shipping,
[1782.82 --> 1785.52]  but I find I don't buy
[1785.52 --> 1787.52]  as much stuff
[1787.52 --> 1788.42]  as I feel like
[1788.42 --> 1789.38]  a lot of people do.
[1789.86 --> 1789.96]  Right.
[1790.48 --> 1790.88]  Really?
[1792.36 --> 1792.80]  Really?
[1792.90 --> 1793.54]  Would you say you're
[1793.54 --> 1795.20]  a cheap...
[1795.20 --> 1797.70]  Yeah, probably.
[1798.02 --> 1798.90]  I don't have any
[1798.90 --> 1799.78]  actual metric
[1799.78 --> 1800.70]  to gauge that on,
[1800.74 --> 1801.78]  but I just feel like I don't.
[1801.90 --> 1802.88]  So technically,
[1803.10 --> 1804.72]  Prime would just lose me money anyways
[1804.72 --> 1805.82]  because realistically,
[1805.82 --> 1806.50]  you're just trying to get
[1806.50 --> 1807.08]  for free shipping.
[1807.20 --> 1808.30]  But you can pay
[1808.30 --> 1809.66]  for the same shipping time.
[1809.94 --> 1810.30]  If you're like,
[1810.38 --> 1811.94]  oh, I need it in two days
[1811.94 --> 1812.26]  or whatever
[1812.26 --> 1813.40]  because I believe in Canada,
[1813.40 --> 1815.04]  that's the Prime shipping standard
[1815.04 --> 1815.66]  is two days.
[1816.00 --> 1816.96]  So you can pay
[1816.96 --> 1817.84]  for the two-day shipping.
[1818.14 --> 1818.62]  And there's a lot
[1818.62 --> 1820.64]  of other retail websites
[1820.64 --> 1822.28]  where you can pay
[1822.28 --> 1823.32]  to get things in two days.
[1823.42 --> 1825.40]  You just have to pay for it
[1825.40 --> 1826.56]  instead of just having Prime,
[1826.74 --> 1827.98]  which you're paying for
[1827.98 --> 1828.92]  just annually.
[1829.04 --> 1830.22]  So it doesn't feel like it.
[1830.38 --> 1831.02]  So when you go to buy
[1831.02 --> 1831.92]  that individual item,
[1832.02 --> 1832.96]  it feels cheaper
[1832.96 --> 1833.62]  because you're getting it
[1833.62 --> 1834.04]  from Amazon,
[1834.24 --> 1835.54]  but it's probably not.
[1835.90 --> 1836.28]  Well, I don't.
[1836.42 --> 1837.10]  Depends on how much
[1837.10 --> 1837.96]  you shop from Amazon.
[1838.08 --> 1838.78]  If you buy from Amazon
[1838.78 --> 1839.74]  like every freaking day,
[1839.84 --> 1840.94]  then sure, definitely,
[1840.94 --> 1841.46]  you're going to save
[1841.46 --> 1842.00]  a ton of money
[1842.00 --> 1842.58]  at the end of the year.
[1842.80 --> 1842.96]  Yeah.
[1843.60 --> 1845.06]  But at my volume,
[1845.80 --> 1847.30]  I would not at all.
[1847.64 --> 1848.60]  I'll hold that thought
[1848.60 --> 1849.14]  for a second.
[1849.26 --> 1850.76]  So what do you do?
[1851.50 --> 1852.78]  Because one of the first hits,
[1852.86 --> 1853.52]  anytime you search
[1853.52 --> 1854.54]  for buy anything,
[1854.64 --> 1855.10]  it's going to be
[1855.10 --> 1855.90]  an Amazon page.
[1856.06 --> 1856.80]  Oh, that's great.
[1857.34 --> 1858.62]  Because Amazon search
[1858.62 --> 1859.36]  is fantastic.
[1859.56 --> 1861.72]  So I usually actually use Amazon
[1861.72 --> 1862.82]  to find the thing
[1862.82 --> 1863.46]  that I want
[1863.46 --> 1865.80]  and then use SKUs
[1865.80 --> 1866.96]  or product names
[1866.96 --> 1867.62]  or descriptions
[1867.62 --> 1869.14]  or just manufacturers
[1869.14 --> 1869.54]  or whatever
[1869.54 --> 1871.10]  and then just find it
[1871.10 --> 1871.76]  elsewhere
[1871.76 --> 1873.12]  and buy it from there.
[1874.20 --> 1874.60]  Cool.
[1874.74 --> 1875.50]  It's just, yeah.
[1875.66 --> 1876.34]  On the subject
[1876.34 --> 1877.56]  of things being cheaper
[1877.56 --> 1878.10]  on Amazon,
[1878.36 --> 1879.70]  that is not necessarily
[1879.70 --> 1880.50]  always true.
[1880.60 --> 1881.66]  So take, for example,
[1882.06 --> 1882.54]  Oh, I just mean
[1882.54 --> 1883.26]  because of the free shipping.
[1883.78 --> 1884.82]  Well, no, even then.
[1885.36 --> 1886.96]  So LTT water bottles
[1886.96 --> 1888.14]  are actually priced
[1888.14 --> 1889.66]  $5 higher on Amazon
[1889.66 --> 1890.30]  than they are
[1890.30 --> 1891.66]  on LTTstore.com.
[1891.72 --> 1892.52]  And for people
[1892.52 --> 1893.36]  with Prime,
[1893.84 --> 1894.96]  that might still
[1894.96 --> 1896.18]  make it less expensive
[1896.18 --> 1897.56]  and faster to get to them
[1897.56 --> 1898.84]  because Amazon has warehouses
[1898.84 --> 1900.26]  all over the place
[1900.26 --> 1901.14]  and stuff like that.
[1901.44 --> 1902.28]  But the reason
[1902.28 --> 1903.00]  that we have them
[1903.00 --> 1903.84]  priced more expensive
[1903.84 --> 1904.32]  and the reason
[1904.32 --> 1905.34]  that a lot of vendors
[1905.34 --> 1905.86]  do that
[1905.86 --> 1906.86]  is because Amazon
[1906.86 --> 1908.56]  charges so much
[1908.56 --> 1909.40]  for fulfilled
[1909.40 --> 1910.56]  by Amazon service
[1910.56 --> 1912.20]  that it's,
[1912.36 --> 1913.28]  your costs
[1913.28 --> 1914.74]  are just inherently higher
[1914.74 --> 1915.28]  when you're working
[1915.28 --> 1915.84]  through Amazon.
[1916.30 --> 1917.32]  So compared to
[1917.32 --> 1918.04]  having,
[1918.80 --> 1919.42]  basically,
[1919.66 --> 1920.30]  I think we're
[1920.30 --> 1921.10]  at the point now
[1921.10 --> 1921.68]  where we're
[1921.68 --> 1923.10]  near half
[1923.10 --> 1924.06]  or over half
[1924.06 --> 1925.14]  of the total business
[1925.14 --> 1927.20]  of the logistics company
[1927.20 --> 1927.82]  that we use
[1927.82 --> 1928.42]  that's run by
[1928.42 --> 1929.04]  one of my old
[1929.04 --> 1930.02]  NCIX colleagues.
[1930.52 --> 1931.60]  So even at the point
[1931.60 --> 1932.24]  where we are like
[1932.24 --> 1934.16]  basically setting up
[1934.16 --> 1934.70]  our own like
[1934.70 --> 1936.40]  half of a logistics company
[1936.40 --> 1937.02]  and funding
[1937.02 --> 1937.84]  that percentage
[1937.84 --> 1938.72]  of that business,
[1939.10 --> 1940.10]  our costs
[1940.10 --> 1941.58]  are so much lower
[1941.58 --> 1942.52]  working through them
[1942.52 --> 1944.40]  that we have to charge
[1944.40 --> 1945.56]  about $5 extra
[1945.56 --> 1945.96]  on Amazon.
[1946.14 --> 1947.04]  And it's not just that.
[1947.36 --> 1947.90]  There's ways
[1947.90 --> 1948.46]  that they just
[1948.46 --> 1949.76]  kind of completely
[1949.76 --> 1950.62]  screw you over
[1950.62 --> 1951.16]  as a vendor
[1951.16 --> 1952.16]  that a lot of people
[1952.16 --> 1953.14]  don't talk about.
[1953.54 --> 1954.38]  Like for example,
[1954.38 --> 1955.46]  an item
[1955.46 --> 1956.68]  was mislabeled.
[1957.12 --> 1957.66]  We don't know
[1957.66 --> 1958.62]  if it was us
[1958.62 --> 1959.60]  who mislabeled it
[1959.60 --> 1960.56]  or if it was them
[1960.56 --> 1961.34]  who mislabeled it
[1961.34 --> 1962.26]  but some people
[1962.26 --> 1963.58]  bought the 40 ounce
[1963.58 --> 1964.68]  LTT water bottle
[1964.68 --> 1964.90]  on,
[1964.96 --> 1965.30]  I think it was
[1965.30 --> 1966.08]  Amazon.ca
[1966.08 --> 1967.78]  and got the 21 ounce
[1967.78 --> 1968.10]  one
[1968.10 --> 1969.38]  and wanted to
[1969.38 --> 1969.84]  return it.
[1969.84 --> 1970.36]  And returned it.
[1970.86 --> 1971.74]  And Amazon basically
[1971.74 --> 1972.96]  flagged the whole thing
[1972.96 --> 1974.84]  as like mislabeled,
[1974.96 --> 1976.34]  immediately blamed us
[1976.34 --> 1977.26]  with no
[1977.26 --> 1978.92]  sort of investigation
[1978.92 --> 1979.46]  whatsoever
[1979.46 --> 1980.76]  and they've had them
[1980.76 --> 1981.82]  for a couple of months
[1981.82 --> 1982.60]  now pending,
[1982.94 --> 1983.78]  sending back to us
[1983.78 --> 1984.64]  which I guess they'll
[1984.64 --> 1986.14]  do when they
[1986.14 --> 1987.00]  feel like it
[1987.00 --> 1987.74]  or something.
[1988.72 --> 1989.94]  And there's other cases
[1989.94 --> 1990.40]  where,
[1990.62 --> 1991.36]  oh man,
[1991.42 --> 1992.34]  I forget what it was
[1992.34 --> 1992.96]  but there's one
[1992.96 --> 1994.18]  there's one stupid thing
[1994.18 --> 1994.88]  where ultimately
[1994.88 --> 1996.08]  we,
[1996.32 --> 1996.58]  oh yeah,
[1996.62 --> 1996.74]  yeah,
[1996.74 --> 1996.88]  yeah,
[1996.88 --> 1997.00]  yeah,
[1997.00 --> 1997.80]  here's a really good one.
[1997.96 --> 1999.42]  If it ships out late
[1999.42 --> 2001.18]  and the customer demands
[2001.18 --> 2001.50]  like,
[2001.58 --> 2002.34]  I think you can demand
[2002.34 --> 2002.94]  some kind of like
[2002.94 --> 2003.44]  chargeback
[2003.44 --> 2004.92]  if it doesn't arrive on
[2004.92 --> 2005.74]  at the time it's like
[2005.74 --> 2006.44]  supposed to arrive
[2006.44 --> 2006.88]  or something.
[2007.06 --> 2007.96]  I forget what it is.
[2008.00 --> 2008.52]  Some kind of like
[2008.52 --> 2010.04]  guaranteed delivery guarantee.
[2010.72 --> 2012.00]  We get penalized
[2012.00 --> 2013.16]  if it doesn't arrive in time
[2013.16 --> 2014.36]  even though it's fulfilled
[2014.36 --> 2014.96]  by Amazon.
[2015.66 --> 2016.92]  It's in their warehouse.
[2017.34 --> 2018.78]  They handle the entire thing
[2018.78 --> 2019.48]  end to end
[2019.48 --> 2020.58]  and we can't build
[2020.58 --> 2021.98]  against our account for it.
[2022.10 --> 2023.08]  And I'm sitting here
[2023.08 --> 2023.40]  going,
[2023.54 --> 2023.76]  what?
[2024.72 --> 2026.04]  That makes no sense.
[2027.08 --> 2027.98]  It makes...
[2027.98 --> 2029.70]  So my big thing is
[2029.70 --> 2030.52]  and we've talked about
[2030.52 --> 2031.42]  this on WAN Show a lot
[2031.42 --> 2032.46]  like when a company
[2032.46 --> 2033.24]  does something
[2033.24 --> 2034.56]  that we don't like,
[2035.10 --> 2035.84]  this used to actually
[2035.84 --> 2037.24]  even be more common
[2037.24 --> 2037.98]  on the WAN Show,
[2038.06 --> 2038.28]  I guess.
[2039.40 --> 2040.10]  We would say
[2040.10 --> 2040.82]  vote with your wallet,
[2041.00 --> 2041.20]  right?
[2041.28 --> 2041.48]  Sure.
[2042.84 --> 2044.52]  We'd stop pre-ordering games.
[2044.84 --> 2046.34]  Stop buying that game
[2046.34 --> 2047.16]  from that store
[2047.16 --> 2048.68]  that is doing things
[2048.68 --> 2049.36]  that you don't like.
[2049.48 --> 2050.26]  Stop doing whatever.
[2050.40 --> 2050.92]  And you can take,
[2051.08 --> 2052.46]  you can decide whatever
[2052.46 --> 2054.90]  about which thing
[2054.90 --> 2055.80]  pisses you off enough
[2055.80 --> 2056.64]  but there's just enough
[2056.64 --> 2057.80]  things that Amazon has done
[2057.80 --> 2058.32]  that I just,
[2058.42 --> 2061.08]  I don't like buying from them.
[2061.16 --> 2062.02]  From like employees
[2062.02 --> 2063.06]  need to piss in bottles
[2063.06 --> 2064.78]  to like all this other
[2064.78 --> 2065.68]  crazy stuff.
[2065.68 --> 2066.54]  No, no, they denied that.
[2066.62 --> 2067.24]  They denied that.
[2067.66 --> 2068.86]  Until they stopped denying it.
[2069.30 --> 2070.78]  Yeah, they can deny
[2070.78 --> 2071.54]  whatever they want.
[2071.86 --> 2072.68]  I just, I don't know.
[2072.82 --> 2074.26]  I like the idea
[2074.26 --> 2075.80]  of supporting these smaller shops.
[2076.02 --> 2076.20]  Yeah.
[2076.56 --> 2077.98]  I often find
[2077.98 --> 2078.76]  that the smaller shops
[2078.76 --> 2079.82]  are much more appreciative
[2079.82 --> 2081.04]  of your business.
[2081.42 --> 2083.04]  I find they're actually still,
[2083.26 --> 2083.96]  some people are like,
[2084.02 --> 2084.82]  oh yeah, Amazon's just
[2084.82 --> 2085.82]  really easy to work with.
[2086.18 --> 2087.16]  Like Linus just said,
[2087.28 --> 2088.40]  the companies
[2088.40 --> 2089.90]  just get blamed for everything
[2089.90 --> 2090.64]  so you can just return
[2090.64 --> 2091.20]  whatever you want.
[2091.34 --> 2092.14]  That's why Amazon
[2092.14 --> 2093.40]  is so easy to work with
[2093.40 --> 2094.02]  as a consumer
[2094.02 --> 2095.72]  because Amazon is screwing over
[2095.72 --> 2097.38]  the vendors on the other side.
[2097.50 --> 2097.96]  Whether it's,
[2098.20 --> 2098.96]  did you see that,
[2099.02 --> 2100.20]  that company that made
[2100.20 --> 2101.72]  a really nice messenger bag
[2101.72 --> 2103.32]  that Amazon Basics
[2103.32 --> 2104.84]  just outright ripped off?
[2104.98 --> 2106.16]  Oh, Amazon Basics
[2106.16 --> 2109.52]  has ruined tons of stuff.
[2109.70 --> 2110.20]  Like, yeah.
[2110.52 --> 2111.86]  So, but I also find
[2111.86 --> 2112.42]  that small vendors
[2112.42 --> 2114.52]  are not difficult to deal with.
[2114.78 --> 2116.22]  And often you get like
[2116.22 --> 2117.80]  really personalized service,
[2118.30 --> 2120.54]  which is pretty nice.
[2120.54 --> 2121.90]  Like I've had no problem
[2121.90 --> 2123.06]  ever since I dropped Amazon
[2123.06 --> 2124.16]  and I actually don't even think
[2124.16 --> 2125.52]  it's really been notably
[2125.52 --> 2126.50]  that much more convenient.
[2126.64 --> 2127.84]  The only thing that I think
[2127.84 --> 2129.40]  was genuinely more convenient
[2129.40 --> 2130.28]  about being on Amazon
[2130.28 --> 2133.24]  is checking the like
[2133.24 --> 2134.66]  tracking status of packages
[2134.66 --> 2135.60]  was more centralized.
[2136.16 --> 2136.30]  Yeah.
[2136.70 --> 2136.96]  Yep.
[2137.08 --> 2138.12]  And I mean,
[2138.12 --> 2139.46]  there's a reason that we use it
[2139.46 --> 2140.38]  so much for the business
[2140.38 --> 2142.22]  because tracking down invoices
[2142.22 --> 2143.18]  and stuff like that
[2143.18 --> 2144.18]  for the accounting team
[2144.18 --> 2147.42]  is so much simpler
[2147.42 --> 2149.00]  when we do the majority
[2149.00 --> 2150.00]  of our ordering through Amazon.
[2150.44 --> 2151.22]  Nick messaged me
[2151.22 --> 2152.56]  about the water bottles.
[2152.76 --> 2153.22]  He says,
[2153.30 --> 2154.26]  we've requested them
[2154.26 --> 2154.82]  to be sent back
[2154.82 --> 2155.36]  through the system
[2155.36 --> 2156.96]  three times now, LMAO.
[2157.30 --> 2158.80]  I think it's working this time
[2158.80 --> 2160.02]  because it's not labeled
[2160.02 --> 2161.52]  as reserved in the system anymore.
[2161.66 --> 2161.96]  But yeah,
[2161.96 --> 2163.66]  it's not a great experience.
[2164.48 --> 2165.08]  With that said,
[2165.44 --> 2165.74]  yeah.
[2165.98 --> 2166.58]  Oh, go ahead.
[2167.12 --> 2167.34]  I just,
[2167.46 --> 2168.68]  I'm seeing people
[2168.68 --> 2169.60]  in Flowplane chat
[2169.60 --> 2170.22]  talk about this
[2170.22 --> 2171.66]  and I know this is a thing.
[2171.80 --> 2174.10]  People will post on Twitter
[2174.10 --> 2175.08]  about how like
[2175.08 --> 2176.46]  the horrible working conditions
[2176.46 --> 2177.64]  and all these horrible practices
[2177.64 --> 2178.72]  that Amazon has
[2178.72 --> 2180.56]  and then turn around
[2180.56 --> 2181.40]  and later that night
[2181.40 --> 2182.70]  order some stuff off Amazon.
[2182.90 --> 2183.38]  And I'm just like,
[2183.60 --> 2183.86]  well,
[2184.08 --> 2186.22]  like if you're just,
[2186.26 --> 2186.88]  if you're just helping
[2186.88 --> 2188.10]  to pour money in that direction,
[2188.18 --> 2188.46]  you're just,
[2188.58 --> 2189.58]  you're just funding,
[2189.70 --> 2191.36]  you're literally funding the problem.
[2192.02 --> 2192.80]  Which is like,
[2192.84 --> 2193.12]  I mean,
[2193.14 --> 2194.56]  if you don't care about those things,
[2194.58 --> 2195.14]  that's whatever.
[2195.14 --> 2196.34]  I'm not saying that you
[2196.34 --> 2198.68]  must act on this or anything,
[2198.96 --> 2202.20]  but I cared
[2202.20 --> 2204.08]  and it was really easy to solve.
[2204.28 --> 2205.02]  So I just did it.
[2205.02 --> 2207.14]  So Palin H says,
[2207.28 --> 2208.52]  if your experience with Amazon
[2208.52 --> 2210.04]  is so bad,
[2210.44 --> 2211.86]  why are you still selling things
[2211.86 --> 2212.18]  through them?
[2212.24 --> 2213.76]  Because overall,
[2213.96 --> 2215.98]  we are deeply invested
[2215.98 --> 2217.50]  and 100% committed
[2217.50 --> 2218.62]  to LTTstore.com.
[2218.82 --> 2220.46]  But at the end of the day,
[2220.88 --> 2221.82]  some people,
[2222.08 --> 2223.30]  and you can see here,
[2223.68 --> 2225.88]  it is a considerable number of people.
[2226.26 --> 2227.36]  Each model
[2227.36 --> 2230.22]  of the LTT circuit board water bottle
[2230.22 --> 2234.36]  has like tens of reviews on it.
[2234.64 --> 2235.74]  So that should tell you,
[2235.82 --> 2236.14]  actually,
[2236.62 --> 2237.78]  I would say that
[2237.78 --> 2239.70]  compared to most products on Amazon,
[2239.96 --> 2242.16]  that is not as representative of sales
[2242.16 --> 2243.48]  because you guys are amazing.
[2243.88 --> 2246.08]  Like our community is rabid.
[2246.16 --> 2247.18]  I'm pretty sure like
[2247.18 --> 2249.86]  most people who buy one
[2249.86 --> 2251.18]  are leaving a review.
[2251.36 --> 2252.04]  Thank you so much.
[2252.08 --> 2252.74]  You guys are amazing.
[2253.32 --> 2255.10]  But that should tell you
[2255.10 --> 2255.72]  that we are moving
[2255.72 --> 2257.02]  a considerable number
[2257.02 --> 2258.16]  of water bottles through Amazon.
[2258.42 --> 2261.06]  So even if we market up,
[2261.42 --> 2262.42]  which helps cover
[2262.42 --> 2263.70]  the cost of Fulfilled by Amazon,
[2263.70 --> 2265.16]  and even if we have to eat it
[2265.16 --> 2265.78]  once in a while
[2265.78 --> 2267.46]  when stupid stuff happens
[2267.46 --> 2268.80]  and we just get blamed for it
[2268.80 --> 2269.44]  for no reason,
[2269.82 --> 2270.92]  there are people
[2270.92 --> 2271.72]  who are just
[2271.72 --> 2273.42]  only going to shop on Amazon
[2273.42 --> 2275.20]  and that is the only way
[2275.20 --> 2275.94]  to reach that audience.
[2275.94 --> 2276.86]  So there's just
[2276.86 --> 2278.32]  not really a lot
[2278.32 --> 2279.08]  we can do about it
[2279.08 --> 2279.62]  if we want to do
[2279.62 --> 2281.38]  what's best for our business
[2281.38 --> 2282.08]  and our employees.
[2282.26 --> 2282.80]  So for me,
[2283.16 --> 2284.40]  I see myself
[2284.40 --> 2287.26]  as the executive officer,
[2287.48 --> 2288.40]  chief executive officer
[2288.40 --> 2289.06]  of the company
[2289.06 --> 2290.74]  as being at the service
[2290.74 --> 2292.22]  of pretty much everyone.
[2292.32 --> 2292.80]  In a way,
[2293.52 --> 2294.90]  everyone is my boss
[2294.90 --> 2297.56]  because if they're dissatisfied,
[2297.78 --> 2299.46]  then I ultimately lose my job.
[2299.66 --> 2301.06]  If my employees
[2301.06 --> 2302.00]  are dissatisfied
[2302.00 --> 2303.18]  and they leave,
[2303.56 --> 2304.58]  I will lose my job
[2304.58 --> 2305.50]  because my job
[2305.50 --> 2307.12]  is to be in charge of them.
[2307.50 --> 2309.02]  So if they're gone,
[2309.02 --> 2310.86]  then I don't have a job anymore.
[2310.96 --> 2312.30]  I can't run the business.
[2312.88 --> 2313.84]  I'm the mutiny boys.
[2314.32 --> 2316.32]  If you guys leave me,
[2316.62 --> 2316.80]  you know,
[2316.84 --> 2317.96]  if the viewers leave me,
[2318.52 --> 2319.92]  then I'm fired, right?
[2320.02 --> 2321.04]  And that was a conversation
[2321.04 --> 2321.98]  that I actually had
[2321.98 --> 2323.10]  with Jonathan Horst.
[2323.46 --> 2323.48]  The,
[2325.30 --> 2325.58]  oh wait,
[2325.62 --> 2325.70]  no,
[2325.74 --> 2326.26]  was it with him?
[2326.34 --> 2326.58]  No,
[2326.66 --> 2326.82]  no,
[2326.86 --> 2328.52]  it was with our new producer.
[2328.66 --> 2328.82]  Actually,
[2328.84 --> 2329.42]  I probably talked to him
[2329.42 --> 2329.82]  about it too,
[2329.88 --> 2331.40]  but it was with an applicant
[2331.40 --> 2332.86]  for the producer position
[2332.86 --> 2334.10]  for Channel Superfund,
[2334.18 --> 2335.36]  which we are maybe
[2335.36 --> 2336.40]  close to hiring,
[2337.06 --> 2338.62]  where they basically asked me
[2338.62 --> 2340.08]  a really good interview question.
[2340.16 --> 2340.84]  This is a really great
[2340.84 --> 2341.56]  interview question.
[2341.70 --> 2341.96]  Ask,
[2342.24 --> 2343.28]  ask your interviewer
[2343.28 --> 2344.00]  if you want to look smart.
[2344.64 --> 2345.42]  They asked me,
[2345.48 --> 2346.94]  what does success look like
[2346.94 --> 2347.46]  in this role?
[2348.40 --> 2348.80]  And,
[2348.96 --> 2349.62]  you know,
[2349.66 --> 2350.86]  I basically said
[2350.86 --> 2351.60]  a bunch of stuff
[2351.60 --> 2352.80]  and they were like,
[2353.00 --> 2353.34]  okay,
[2353.40 --> 2354.58]  so at the bottom line,
[2354.64 --> 2355.44]  you don't really know.
[2355.48 --> 2355.80]  And I said,
[2355.86 --> 2356.08]  yeah,
[2356.12 --> 2356.80]  that's the truth
[2356.80 --> 2358.60]  because I'm not your boss.
[2358.98 --> 2359.38]  Like,
[2359.48 --> 2359.66]  yeah,
[2359.66 --> 2359.94]  sure,
[2359.98 --> 2361.06]  I'll sign your paychecks
[2361.06 --> 2363.00]  and you'll report into me
[2363.00 --> 2364.26]  when stuff is good
[2364.26 --> 2365.06]  or stuff is bad
[2365.06 --> 2365.58]  or you need help
[2365.58 --> 2366.02]  or whatever.
[2366.86 --> 2368.14]  But at the end of the day,
[2368.50 --> 2369.74]  your boss is the audience.
[2369.92 --> 2371.18]  If they're not happy,
[2371.88 --> 2372.42]  you're fired.
[2372.76 --> 2374.12]  And if they're not happy with me,
[2374.42 --> 2374.94]  guess what?
[2375.02 --> 2375.90]  I'm fired too
[2375.90 --> 2377.04]  because my job
[2377.04 --> 2378.28]  hangs by a thread
[2378.28 --> 2380.04]  every single day.
[2380.08 --> 2381.18]  We've got a lot of good momentum.
[2381.34 --> 2382.36]  We've got a lot of good people.
[2382.44 --> 2383.58]  We've got a lot of expertise,
[2383.68 --> 2384.52]  a lot of know-how,
[2384.58 --> 2385.24]  a lot of equipment.
[2385.50 --> 2386.90]  So we're better positioned
[2386.90 --> 2388.24]  to be competitive in this space
[2388.24 --> 2389.66]  than almost anyone else.
[2390.32 --> 2392.86]  But that doesn't change anything
[2392.86 --> 2394.26]  if the audience decides,
[2394.26 --> 2394.74]  you know what?
[2394.84 --> 2395.64]  I don't really like
[2395.64 --> 2396.54]  Linus Tech Tips anymore
[2396.54 --> 2398.22]  because it's over.
[2398.60 --> 2399.66]  That's the end of the game.
[2400.02 --> 2400.52]  We're done.
[2401.26 --> 2401.52]  Right?
[2402.66 --> 2404.54]  So I forget how I got on this topic.
[2405.12 --> 2406.92]  Did someone posted a question
[2406.92 --> 2407.76]  or something like that?
[2407.82 --> 2409.34]  Can't remember what I'm responding to,
[2409.34 --> 2411.34]  but crap.
[2412.60 --> 2414.58]  Where did I come from with this?
[2415.32 --> 2415.68]  You know what?
[2415.72 --> 2416.34]  It doesn't matter.
[2418.48 --> 2419.74]  ABCB over on Floatplane.
[2421.14 --> 2422.42]  I still love the Swacket.
[2422.50 --> 2423.30]  Wife doesn't really get it,
[2423.30 --> 2424.12]  but can you make a V2?
[2424.24 --> 2425.08]  We are working on it.
[2425.58 --> 2427.80]  So we're still going to work with Amazon
[2427.80 --> 2429.38]  because it's,
[2430.48 --> 2431.36]  there's just,
[2432.30 --> 2434.36]  why was I talking about that?
[2434.36 --> 2436.04]  It's something that I would bring up.
[2436.72 --> 2437.78]  It's just a tangent.
[2438.08 --> 2438.30]  All right.
[2438.50 --> 2440.28]  It's like you're a merchant
[2440.28 --> 2441.10]  trying to sell things
[2441.10 --> 2442.36]  and you don't set up your stall.
[2442.72 --> 2443.54]  It's a criticism
[2443.54 --> 2444.54]  that I used to give to Intel
[2444.54 --> 2445.04]  all the time.
[2445.40 --> 2445.94]  Okay, I remember.
[2446.78 --> 2447.34]  Okay, sorry.
[2447.34 --> 2447.96]  I remember.
[2447.96 --> 2448.44]  I remember.
[2448.78 --> 2449.34]  I was saying,
[2449.52 --> 2451.16]  I'm a bad chief executive officer
[2451.16 --> 2452.16]  if I don't do best,
[2452.26 --> 2453.26]  do what's best for
[2453.26 --> 2454.78]  the people that I work for,
[2455.00 --> 2455.84]  which is my employees.
[2455.98 --> 2456.92]  If we are not selling
[2456.92 --> 2458.08]  those water bottles on Amazon,
[2458.08 --> 2459.10]  at the end of the day,
[2459.18 --> 2460.04]  that's going to affect
[2460.04 --> 2461.08]  our budgeting for next year,
[2461.14 --> 2461.98]  which is going to affect
[2461.98 --> 2462.74]  their compensation,
[2463.00 --> 2463.76]  which is going to affect
[2463.76 --> 2464.78]  their happiness and morale,
[2464.92 --> 2465.78]  which is going to affect
[2465.78 --> 2466.80]  my ability to keep running
[2466.80 --> 2467.30]  this company
[2467.30 --> 2468.22]  and we're all going to get fired.
[2468.38 --> 2469.60]  So I have to ultimately
[2469.60 --> 2470.90]  do what's best for the business
[2470.90 --> 2472.82]  within reason,
[2472.92 --> 2474.02]  within the limits
[2474.02 --> 2475.44]  of what I am morally
[2475.44 --> 2477.14]  allow myself to do.
[2477.30 --> 2478.44]  If people are going
[2478.44 --> 2479.28]  to shop on Amazon
[2479.28 --> 2480.04]  and there's nothing
[2480.04 --> 2481.04]  I can do to stop them
[2481.04 --> 2481.82]  and I can't reach them
[2481.82 --> 2482.28]  anywhere else,
[2482.42 --> 2483.52]  the reality of it is
[2483.52 --> 2484.10]  we're going to have
[2484.10 --> 2484.96]  water bottles on Amazon.
[2485.30 --> 2486.12]  That was where I was going
[2486.12 --> 2486.46]  with that.
[2486.64 --> 2487.00]  Sorry, Luke.
[2487.06 --> 2487.42]  Go ahead.
[2487.50 --> 2488.10]  You're talking to Intel.
[2488.94 --> 2490.80]  Yeah, so my point was like
[2490.80 --> 2494.18]  I used to constantly roast Intel
[2494.18 --> 2495.36]  for not showing up to PAX
[2495.36 --> 2497.54]  because they had this
[2497.54 --> 2499.16]  constant PAX presence
[2499.16 --> 2500.26]  for years
[2500.26 --> 2501.82]  and by talking to a bunch of them,
[2501.96 --> 2503.38]  they effectively decided like,
[2503.48 --> 2504.68]  oh, the ROI doesn't really
[2504.68 --> 2505.24]  seem to be there.
[2505.24 --> 2506.10]  So we're backing out.
[2506.36 --> 2506.48]  Right.
[2506.86 --> 2508.48]  And that was just,
[2508.88 --> 2511.06]  I would argue to the end
[2511.06 --> 2511.60]  of the earth
[2511.60 --> 2513.46]  without the proper metrics
[2513.46 --> 2514.62]  and probably without
[2514.62 --> 2515.36]  the proper words
[2515.36 --> 2516.32]  to explain it.
[2516.40 --> 2517.58]  But that was an incredibly
[2517.58 --> 2518.34]  stupid move.
[2518.76 --> 2521.12]  And I have talked to people there
[2521.12 --> 2522.26]  that have argued against me
[2522.26 --> 2525.24]  and I have found little
[2525.24 --> 2526.54]  to no value in their arguments
[2526.54 --> 2527.40]  and I maintain that
[2527.40 --> 2528.28]  that was just an incredibly
[2528.28 --> 2528.94]  stupid move
[2528.94 --> 2530.78]  because they didn't,
[2530.96 --> 2531.72]  they were a vendor
[2531.72 --> 2532.74]  and they didn't put their booth
[2532.74 --> 2533.34]  at the market.
[2533.34 --> 2535.46]  Like it's that basic.
[2535.68 --> 2536.52]  Maybe they didn't make
[2536.52 --> 2537.12]  the money there.
[2537.36 --> 2538.64]  Maybe, I have no idea,
[2538.86 --> 2539.98]  but maybe you guys
[2539.98 --> 2541.06]  don't make an incredible amount
[2541.06 --> 2541.92]  on those water bottles,
[2542.12 --> 2543.70]  but it's out there.
[2543.96 --> 2545.30]  It's an available storefront.
[2545.52 --> 2546.52]  You guys should do it.
[2546.74 --> 2547.90]  It gets your name out there.
[2547.96 --> 2549.12]  It gets people more focused
[2549.12 --> 2550.84]  on the idea of LTT merch.
[2551.04 --> 2551.88]  They're really high quality
[2551.88 --> 2552.46]  water bottles.
[2552.58 --> 2553.52]  The more they're around,
[2553.58 --> 2554.76]  the more available they are.
[2554.76 --> 2556.26]  If you get that into the hands
[2556.26 --> 2557.74]  of someone who's a super fan,
[2557.90 --> 2559.26]  but they only shop on Amazon
[2559.26 --> 2560.68]  and then they try it,
[2560.72 --> 2560.96]  they're like,
[2561.08 --> 2561.98]  wow, this is awesome.
[2562.38 --> 2564.08]  They might branch off on Amazon.
[2564.08 --> 2564.30]  Leave a five-star review.
[2564.86 --> 2565.96]  They might leave a five-star review.
[2566.16 --> 2567.28]  They might go to LTT store.
[2567.40 --> 2568.04]  They might recommend it
[2568.04 --> 2568.50]  to their friends.
[2568.62 --> 2569.02]  They might do
[2569.02 --> 2570.08]  these other various things.
[2570.28 --> 2571.14]  So, you know,
[2571.18 --> 2572.50]  that has multiple impacts.
[2572.82 --> 2573.46]  Like Luke said,
[2573.54 --> 2574.88]  they might go to LTTstore.com
[2574.88 --> 2575.64]  and buy a t-shirt
[2575.64 --> 2576.90]  or they might leave
[2576.90 --> 2577.70]  a five-star review,
[2577.82 --> 2579.14]  which might influence someone
[2579.14 --> 2580.48]  who's never even heard
[2580.48 --> 2581.74]  of Linus Tech Tips
[2581.74 --> 2583.44]  to just buy this water bottle
[2583.44 --> 2584.62]  thinking that Linus Tech Tips
[2584.62 --> 2586.28]  is a water bottle brand
[2586.28 --> 2587.88]  and they just buy it
[2587.88 --> 2588.60]  and like it.
[2589.58 --> 2590.54]  So it's,
[2590.84 --> 2591.48]  I mean,
[2591.50 --> 2592.56]  it's not impossible, right?
[2592.62 --> 2593.96]  I'm sure someone has bought it
[2593.96 --> 2594.90]  who like has no idea
[2594.90 --> 2595.36]  what the heck
[2595.36 --> 2596.30]  Linus Tech Tips is.
[2596.68 --> 2597.68]  Although I do think,
[2597.82 --> 2598.00]  Nick,
[2598.04 --> 2598.74]  I know you're watching.
[2599.08 --> 2600.06]  I do think we could do
[2600.06 --> 2601.32]  a better job of like
[2601.32 --> 2602.14]  the merchandising
[2602.14 --> 2602.82]  on these things
[2602.82 --> 2605.96]  because just 40 ounce capacity,
[2606.16 --> 2606.78]  I think we could say
[2606.78 --> 2607.42]  a little more about
[2607.42 --> 2608.24]  how it keeps your drinks
[2608.24 --> 2608.98]  cold or hot
[2608.98 --> 2610.08]  or, you know,
[2610.20 --> 2611.00]  whatever.
[2611.00 --> 2615.18]  Oh man,
[2615.60 --> 2616.42]  this is great.
[2619.36 --> 2619.76]  These,
[2620.28 --> 2620.90]  these,
[2620.98 --> 2621.86]  these reviews
[2621.86 --> 2622.46]  are really good.
[2622.84 --> 2623.00]  Oh,
[2623.18 --> 2623.86]  you can get rid
[2623.86 --> 2624.68]  of the metallic smell.
[2624.80 --> 2625.62]  It just takes a while.
[2625.68 --> 2626.26]  It's kind of like
[2626.26 --> 2627.40]  when you get a new fridge
[2627.40 --> 2628.56]  and you have like
[2628.56 --> 2629.56]  the water dispenser in it.
[2629.94 --> 2631.18]  You got to actually wash it
[2631.18 --> 2632.62]  like quite a lot of times.
[2632.80 --> 2634.46]  The manufacturing stink
[2634.46 --> 2635.02]  is,
[2635.12 --> 2635.64]  is real.
[2636.10 --> 2636.96]  The Lord has blessed
[2636.96 --> 2637.88]  this one very good.
[2637.88 --> 2638.80]  I like sip sip.
[2639.38 --> 2640.04]  You guys,
[2640.16 --> 2641.00]  you guys are great.
[2641.28 --> 2642.06]  You guys are great.
[2642.26 --> 2642.76]  By the way,
[2642.78 --> 2644.32]  we actually have another
[2644.32 --> 2645.96]  LTT store product
[2645.96 --> 2648.58]  that is new on Amazon.
[2648.94 --> 2649.94]  We don't have a ton
[2649.94 --> 2650.56]  of them in stock
[2650.56 --> 2651.18]  because Amazon,
[2651.34 --> 2651.50]  again,
[2651.58 --> 2652.46]  like stupid limitations.
[2652.46 --> 2653.34]  They only let you put
[2653.34 --> 2654.32]  like a handful
[2654.32 --> 2656.22]  on the store at a time.
[2656.28 --> 2657.74]  But ABCs of Gaming
[2657.74 --> 2659.70]  is officially on Amazon.com.
[2659.86 --> 2660.72]  I noticed something
[2660.72 --> 2661.70]  really weird though.
[2662.12 --> 2663.02]  This is hilarious.
[2663.58 --> 2665.00]  So check this out,
[2665.06 --> 2665.24]  Luke.
[2665.24 --> 2667.72]  You can buy,
[2667.86 --> 2668.44]  hold on a second.
[2668.66 --> 2669.18]  Where is it?
[2669.22 --> 2669.54]  Ah, yes.
[2669.66 --> 2672.26]  One used from $8.77.
[2674.56 --> 2675.56]  How would someone
[2675.56 --> 2676.90]  have a used copy
[2676.90 --> 2678.62]  of ABCs of Gaming?
[2678.68 --> 2680.04]  We have only sold it
[2680.04 --> 2681.06]  through LTT store
[2681.06 --> 2682.84]  and Amazon hasn't sold
[2682.84 --> 2683.72]  a single unit yet,
[2683.76 --> 2684.20]  I don't think,
[2684.26 --> 2684.88]  because we have not
[2684.88 --> 2685.74]  announced this yet.
[2686.12 --> 2687.36]  So I clicked on this
[2687.36 --> 2688.26]  because I was really
[2688.26 --> 2689.20]  curious about it
[2689.20 --> 2690.92]  and check this out.
[2691.36 --> 2692.36]  Oh, where did it go?
[2692.42 --> 2693.38]  Is it another vendor
[2693.38 --> 2693.88]  or something?
[2693.96 --> 2694.78]  There was one.
[2695.24 --> 2695.78]  Hold on.
[2696.62 --> 2697.26]  Where is it?
[2697.52 --> 2697.82]  Oh, yeah.
[2697.88 --> 2698.26]  Here we go.
[2698.32 --> 2698.66]  Here we go.
[2698.70 --> 2699.04]  Here we go.
[2699.38 --> 2700.94]  So Honest Abe's Books
[2700.94 --> 2701.46]  and Media.
[2701.84 --> 2703.62]  It's not actually used.
[2704.00 --> 2704.94]  It's new.
[2705.42 --> 2707.36]  And it's $13.26
[2707.36 --> 2709.08]  plus $12.50
[2709.08 --> 2709.82]  of shipping,
[2710.48 --> 2712.20]  which makes me wonder.
[2712.34 --> 2713.48]  Okay, so that's a total
[2713.48 --> 2715.36]  of about almost $27.
[2717.12 --> 2718.12]  Or $26?
[2718.30 --> 2719.00]  Yeah, $26.
[2719.00 --> 2720.64]  which makes me wonder
[2720.64 --> 2721.90]  if there are actually
[2721.90 --> 2725.04]  used bookstores on Amazon
[2725.04 --> 2726.32]  whose entire business
[2726.32 --> 2728.02]  is to algorithmically
[2728.02 --> 2729.28]  check the price
[2729.28 --> 2730.74]  across a variety
[2730.74 --> 2731.80]  of different outlets
[2731.80 --> 2734.12]  and then list it on Amazon
[2734.12 --> 2736.36]  knowing that they can buy it
[2736.36 --> 2737.88]  because it doesn't cost $13
[2737.88 --> 2739.58]  to ship or $12.50
[2739.58 --> 2740.40]  to ship that thing
[2740.40 --> 2741.30]  within the United States.
[2741.30 --> 2743.84]  So knowing that they can buy it,
[2744.12 --> 2745.38]  have it shipped to them,
[2745.38 --> 2747.98]  and then reship it to a customer
[2747.98 --> 2750.36]  and show a lower sticker price
[2750.36 --> 2751.54]  but make margin
[2751.54 --> 2753.04]  on that high shipping cost
[2753.04 --> 2753.80]  and that's like
[2753.80 --> 2754.76]  their entire business
[2754.76 --> 2755.74]  is making like
[2755.74 --> 2758.28]  5 or 10 or 15 points
[2758.28 --> 2759.42]  on this like
[2759.42 --> 2760.44]  buying from Amazon
[2760.44 --> 2762.24]  and then reselling to you
[2762.24 --> 2764.52]  with deceptive shipping prices
[2764.52 --> 2765.80]  or something like that
[2765.80 --> 2767.16]  because there's no other way
[2767.16 --> 2768.42]  that Honest Abe...
[2768.42 --> 2768.94]  What was it called?
[2769.06 --> 2769.90]  Honest Abe's bookstore?
[2769.90 --> 2770.90]  Honest Abe's,
[2770.90 --> 2772.26]  which makes it more funny
[2772.26 --> 2773.18]  in this context.
[2774.08 --> 2775.12]  Isn't that great?
[2775.38 --> 2777.26]  That's pretty awesome.
[2777.58 --> 2778.64]  Go figure, right?
[2779.90 --> 2780.92]  So anyway, yeah.
[2780.92 --> 2781.36]  Interesting idea.
[2781.48 --> 2782.44]  ABC's Gaming is on there.
[2782.52 --> 2784.96]  Oh, last bit of LTT store news.
[2786.14 --> 2787.16]  They're in stock.
[2789.86 --> 2791.80]  Oh, I have an interesting story
[2791.80 --> 2792.24]  about this.
[2792.46 --> 2794.24]  Do you know Lord Barrington?
[2794.60 --> 2794.98]  Ah, yes.
[2794.98 --> 2795.62]  You know Barrington, right?
[2795.70 --> 2795.82]  Yeah.
[2796.02 --> 2798.44]  So he started Twitch streaming recently
[2798.44 --> 2801.32]  and I noticed something familiar
[2801.32 --> 2802.96]  in the background of his stream
[2802.96 --> 2804.88]  and it was a mouse pad
[2804.88 --> 2806.10]  and I asked him why
[2806.10 --> 2808.06]  the entire backdrop of his stream
[2808.06 --> 2809.64]  was a mouse pad
[2809.64 --> 2810.80]  and it's because the mouse pad
[2810.80 --> 2812.26]  was too big for his desk
[2812.26 --> 2814.06]  so he just hung it up behind him
[2814.06 --> 2815.18]  because he thinks it looks cool.
[2815.68 --> 2816.68]  That's hilarious.
[2817.64 --> 2818.04]  Barrington,
[2818.38 --> 2821.10]  you are the truest of OGs.
[2822.10 --> 2822.96]  Oh, geez.
[2822.96 --> 2827.14]  So not only is it a mouse pad
[2827.14 --> 2828.42]  but if you want them
[2828.42 --> 2830.64]  it's a $30 piece of wall art.
[2832.76 --> 2833.52]  Oh, man.
[2833.62 --> 2834.44]  You know, the funny thing
[2834.44 --> 2835.58]  about this thing is like
[2835.58 --> 2837.44]  mouse pads should not be
[2837.44 --> 2838.68]  as expensive as they are.
[2838.74 --> 2839.96]  They are such a ripoff.
[2840.28 --> 2841.18]  Like, think about it.
[2841.26 --> 2843.34]  If we can make a 1.2 meter
[2843.34 --> 2846.94]  by 70 centimeter desk pad
[2846.94 --> 2849.46]  and charge $30 for it
[2849.46 --> 2851.26]  that's how much margin
[2851.26 --> 2852.78]  other companies are making
[2852.78 --> 2855.56]  on like their mouse pads, okay?
[2855.90 --> 2856.94]  And to be clear
[2856.94 --> 2858.34]  just because it has
[2858.34 --> 2859.50]  four times the material
[2859.50 --> 2860.40]  doesn't mean it costs
[2860.40 --> 2861.20]  four times as much.
[2861.58 --> 2863.58]  A lot of the cost of a mouse pad
[2863.58 --> 2865.64]  is in just the machine time
[2865.64 --> 2866.42]  to create it
[2866.42 --> 2868.24]  not actually in the materials cost.
[2868.82 --> 2870.26]  So that's why
[2870.26 --> 2871.78]  all of them are the same price
[2871.78 --> 2873.94]  and actually at the higher end
[2873.94 --> 2875.56]  we are making substantially
[2875.56 --> 2876.62]  less margin on them
[2876.62 --> 2877.72]  compared to on the lower end.
[2877.86 --> 2879.72]  It's just that when we average it out
[2879.72 --> 2880.66]  we looked at it
[2880.66 --> 2881.46]  and kind of went like
[2881.46 --> 2882.12]  yeah, this is
[2882.12 --> 2884.32]  this is all pretty doable
[2884.32 --> 2885.28]  at $30
[2885.28 --> 2887.08]  so I really don't understand
[2887.08 --> 2888.06]  why that's so complicated.
[2889.46 --> 2890.04]  All right.
[2890.10 --> 2890.62]  So that's it.
[2890.68 --> 2891.72]  I promise that's the last
[2891.72 --> 2893.54]  of the LTT store stuff.
[2893.74 --> 2894.80]  Now, why don't we jump into
[2894.80 --> 2896.32]  one of our main tech topics
[2896.32 --> 2896.72]  of the day.
[2896.82 --> 2898.40]  NVIDIA is entering the CPU
[2898.40 --> 2900.68]  and laptop business.
[2901.06 --> 2902.08]  Their GTC event
[2902.08 --> 2902.98]  happened this week
[2902.98 --> 2904.08]  and they had little to say
[2904.08 --> 2904.46]  to gamers
[2904.46 --> 2905.52]  but they have thrown down
[2905.52 --> 2905.96]  the gauntlet
[2905.96 --> 2906.52]  for pretty much
[2906.52 --> 2907.82]  the entire rest of the industry.
[2908.46 --> 2909.12]  So Grace
[2909.12 --> 2910.46]  is an ARM CPU
[2910.46 --> 2911.96]  aimed at the data center
[2911.96 --> 2913.14]  named for computer scientist
[2913.14 --> 2914.04]  Grace Hopper
[2914.04 --> 2915.12]  who theorized
[2915.12 --> 2915.66]  and developed
[2915.66 --> 2916.90]  what would become COBOL.
[2917.36 --> 2918.02]  It's designed
[2918.02 --> 2918.96]  for large data sets
[2918.96 --> 2920.46]  like natural language processing
[2920.46 --> 2922.54]  and recommender systems
[2922.54 --> 2923.36]  and NVIDIA claims
[2923.36 --> 2925.26]  10 times the performance
[2925.26 --> 2927.38]  of today's fastest servers
[2927.38 --> 2928.92]  on AI and HPC workloads.
[2929.00 --> 2929.72]  What we don't know
[2929.72 --> 2931.02]  is if that is based
[2931.02 --> 2932.76]  on the NVIDIA GPU
[2932.76 --> 2933.76]  that will be using
[2933.76 --> 2934.54]  a fourth gen
[2934.54 --> 2935.36]  NVLink
[2935.36 --> 2936.44]  and will be
[2936.44 --> 2937.84]  probably new GPUs
[2937.84 --> 2938.48]  by that point
[2938.48 --> 2939.46]  compared to what is
[2939.46 --> 2940.92]  available today.
[2941.42 --> 2942.20]  Yeah, we do know
[2942.20 --> 2943.06]  that NVIDIA is
[2943.06 --> 2944.36]  extremely fond
[2944.36 --> 2945.00]  of saying
[2945.00 --> 2946.24]  X times
[2946.24 --> 2946.94]  the performance
[2946.94 --> 2947.78]  of this
[2947.78 --> 2948.78]  but with having
[2948.78 --> 2949.86]  like very specific
[2949.86 --> 2951.06]  qualifications for that
[2951.06 --> 2951.74]  but then not
[2951.74 --> 2952.88]  disclaiming those.
[2953.14 --> 2954.24]  So yeah,
[2954.60 --> 2955.76]  a bit of an issue
[2955.76 --> 2957.04]  but oh well.
[2957.04 --> 2957.96]  it'll use
[2957.96 --> 2959.84]  LPDDR5X memory
[2959.84 --> 2960.56]  for two times
[2960.56 --> 2960.98]  the bandwidth
[2960.98 --> 2961.92]  and better efficiency
[2961.92 --> 2962.76]  than DDR4
[2962.76 --> 2964.40]  with this is really cool
[2964.40 --> 2966.02]  unified cache coherence
[2966.02 --> 2967.42]  with a single memory space
[2967.42 --> 2968.68]  that combines system
[2968.68 --> 2970.24]  and HBM GPU memory.
[2970.68 --> 2971.40]  Holy crap.
[2971.50 --> 2972.08]  So that
[2972.08 --> 2973.10]  is thanks to the
[2973.10 --> 2974.64]  900 gigabyte
[2974.64 --> 2975.86]  not bit
[2975.86 --> 2977.58]  900 gigabyte
[2977.58 --> 2978.56]  per second link
[2978.56 --> 2980.10]  between Grace CPUs
[2980.10 --> 2982.20]  and NVIDIA's GPUs.
[2983.04 --> 2983.36]  Whew!
[2983.36 --> 2984.88]  Intel's new CEO
[2984.88 --> 2985.60]  Pat Gelsinger
[2985.60 --> 2986.58]  responded to the threat
[2986.58 --> 2987.22]  by proclaiming
[2987.22 --> 2988.28]  we're playing offense
[2988.28 --> 2989.26]  not defense
[2989.26 --> 2989.78]  yo.
[2990.50 --> 2991.94]  I added the yo part
[2991.94 --> 2992.80]  he didn't say yo
[2992.80 --> 2994.86]  but yeah.
[2995.08 --> 2995.54]  Would have been cooler
[2995.54 --> 2996.06]  if he did.
[2996.28 --> 2997.06]  He pointed out
[2997.06 --> 2997.92]  that Intel has
[2997.92 --> 2998.66]  Deep Learning Boost
[2998.66 --> 3000.18]  and their Habana AI processors
[3000.18 --> 3001.16]  that's a company
[3001.16 --> 3001.60]  they purchased
[3001.60 --> 3002.44]  in late 2019.
[3003.06 --> 3003.68]  Anthony's take
[3003.68 --> 3004.98]  he's aware
[3004.98 --> 3005.74]  Intel's in fact
[3005.74 --> 3006.38]  playing defense
[3006.38 --> 3006.86]  right now
[3006.86 --> 3007.48]  but he's a fighter
[3007.48 --> 3009.04]  so he won't admit it.
[3009.62 --> 3011.08]  I want to input
[3011.08 --> 3011.88]  on that actually.
[3012.08 --> 3012.38]  I read that
[3012.38 --> 3013.00]  before the show
[3013.00 --> 3013.84]  and I think
[3013.84 --> 3014.28]  that's
[3014.28 --> 3014.72]  one second.
[3015.46 --> 3015.70]  Okay.
[3016.10 --> 3016.58]  I'm going to keep
[3016.58 --> 3017.08]  going anyways.
[3017.58 --> 3018.68]  Well I kind of
[3018.68 --> 3019.42]  need Linus to hear this.
[3019.64 --> 3020.56]  I'll tell you guys first.
[3020.88 --> 3021.16]  We'll see what
[3021.16 --> 3022.02]  your guys' reaction is.
[3022.50 --> 3023.08]  So I think
[3023.08 --> 3023.54]  that's a very
[3023.54 --> 3024.60]  informed take
[3024.60 --> 3026.90]  but I do also think
[3026.90 --> 3028.88]  that Pat Gelsinger's
[3028.88 --> 3030.24]  new strats
[3030.24 --> 3031.32]  is putting Intel
[3031.32 --> 3031.90]  on the offense
[3031.90 --> 3032.56]  in general.
[3032.74 --> 3032.96]  Yes.
[3033.44 --> 3034.98]  So I don't think
[3034.98 --> 3036.42]  like yeah
[3036.42 --> 3037.52]  technically this is
[3037.52 --> 3038.30]  Intel's space
[3038.30 --> 3039.00]  to defend
[3039.00 --> 3039.90]  but I think
[3039.90 --> 3040.86]  Pat's point
[3040.86 --> 3041.42]  is like
[3041.42 --> 3042.40]  we're not acting
[3042.40 --> 3043.26]  like we used to
[3043.26 --> 3044.48]  and whether you guys
[3044.48 --> 3045.52]  were coming or not
[3045.52 --> 3047.06]  we're pushing forward.
[3047.64 --> 3049.20]  So I am so glad
[3049.20 --> 3050.26]  because man
[3050.26 --> 3051.16]  when Intel
[3051.16 --> 3052.16]  with the resources
[3052.16 --> 3052.86]  they have
[3052.86 --> 3053.50]  and the brains
[3053.50 --> 3054.20]  they have
[3054.20 --> 3055.16]  is focused
[3055.16 --> 3056.74]  on doing cool stuff
[3056.74 --> 3058.56]  boy does it ever
[3058.56 --> 3059.18]  make tech
[3059.18 --> 3059.92]  more exciting.
[3060.58 --> 3061.48]  Like I am
[3061.48 --> 3062.42]  so jazzed.
[3063.70 --> 3064.74]  If Intel's
[3064.74 --> 3065.88]  discrete graphics cards
[3065.88 --> 3066.66]  are anywhere
[3066.66 --> 3067.94]  near decent
[3067.94 --> 3069.46]  I am just
[3069.46 --> 3070.88]  so excited
[3070.88 --> 3071.20]  because
[3071.20 --> 3071.90]  they're the
[3071.90 --> 3073.02]  only ones
[3073.02 --> 3074.10]  that I think
[3074.10 --> 3074.60]  can
[3074.60 --> 3079.96]  command
[3079.96 --> 3080.76]  Nvidia's
[3080.76 --> 3081.28]  respect
[3081.28 --> 3082.32]  in the longer
[3082.32 --> 3082.66]  term
[3082.66 --> 3084.14]  in that space
[3084.14 --> 3085.38]  I hope.
[3086.84 --> 3088.10]  I hope as well.
[3088.22 --> 3089.20]  Media tech partnership
[3089.20 --> 3089.94]  to bring RTX
[3089.94 --> 3090.64]  graphics to
[3090.64 --> 3091.52]  ARM laptops
[3091.52 --> 3092.76]  that's pretty cool
[3092.76 --> 3093.22]  they're apparently
[3093.22 --> 3093.98]  working on that
[3093.98 --> 3094.46]  as well
[3094.46 --> 3095.72]  and AMD
[3095.72 --> 3096.46]  has previously
[3096.46 --> 3096.92]  been rumored
[3096.92 --> 3097.70]  to be developing
[3097.70 --> 3098.38]  ARM silicon
[3098.38 --> 3099.88]  ARM CPU integration
[3099.88 --> 3100.50]  with GPUs
[3100.50 --> 3101.06]  is too big of an
[3101.06 --> 3101.68]  advantage not to
[3101.68 --> 3101.96]  pursue
[3101.96 --> 3102.68]  so it's not like
[3102.68 --> 3103.62]  Nvidia's the only
[3103.62 --> 3104.40]  one that's probably
[3104.40 --> 3106.46]  chasing after this
[3106.46 --> 3106.94]  right now
[3106.94 --> 3108.04]  but they're the ones
[3108.04 --> 3108.86]  that are announcing it
[3108.86 --> 3109.78]  they've got a road map
[3109.78 --> 3111.32]  and it's pretty exciting
[3111.32 --> 3111.98]  not just for the
[3111.98 --> 3112.52]  data center
[3112.52 --> 3113.86]  but also for the
[3113.86 --> 3114.66]  laptop space
[3114.66 --> 3115.04]  I mean
[3115.04 --> 3116.30]  man
[3116.30 --> 3116.94]  what is that
[3116.94 --> 3117.58]  even gonna
[3117.58 --> 3119.18]  look like
[3119.18 --> 3119.60]  you know
[3119.60 --> 3120.54]  you could potentially
[3120.54 --> 3121.38]  be gaming
[3121.38 --> 3122.48]  on ARM
[3122.48 --> 3123.42]  because as soon as
[3123.42 --> 3124.34]  Nvidia starts
[3124.34 --> 3125.14]  to throw money
[3125.14 --> 3125.78]  at the problem
[3125.78 --> 3126.86]  you know that
[3126.86 --> 3127.48]  it's not just
[3127.48 --> 3128.14]  on the front end
[3128.14 --> 3128.68]  it's not just
[3128.68 --> 3129.26]  on devices
[3129.26 --> 3129.76]  it's gonna be
[3129.76 --> 3130.40]  on the back end
[3130.40 --> 3130.84]  as well
[3130.84 --> 3131.94]  getting actual games
[3131.94 --> 3132.62]  you actually want
[3132.62 --> 3133.02]  to play
[3133.02 --> 3134.26]  ported to ARM devices
[3134.26 --> 3134.66]  you know
[3134.66 --> 3136.00]  speaking of actual
[3136.00 --> 3136.82]  games I actually
[3136.82 --> 3137.36]  want to play
[3137.36 --> 3138.24]  on ARM devices
[3138.24 --> 3139.48]  Apple
[3139.48 --> 3140.86]  has an exclusive
[3140.86 --> 3142.00]  on Apple Arcade
[3142.00 --> 3142.98]  that I actually
[3142.98 --> 3143.96]  care enough about
[3143.96 --> 3144.90]  that I am tempted
[3144.90 --> 3145.94]  to buy Apple Arcade
[3145.94 --> 3146.46]  and play it
[3146.46 --> 3147.30]  what
[3147.30 --> 3148.46]  have you seen
[3148.46 --> 3149.48]  Fantasian
[3149.48 --> 3151.32]  no
[3151.32 --> 3151.82]  okay
[3151.82 --> 3153.40]  so this is
[3153.40 --> 3154.58]  this is part
[3154.58 --> 3156.42]  one of the things
[3156.42 --> 3157.14]  that really drew
[3157.14 --> 3157.74]  me to it
[3157.74 --> 3158.38]  is that
[3158.38 --> 3159.36]  it is
[3159.36 --> 3160.30]  in no small
[3160.30 --> 3160.90]  part being
[3160.90 --> 3161.54]  worked on
[3161.54 --> 3162.72]  by team members
[3162.72 --> 3164.12]  from Final Fantasy 6
[3164.12 --> 3164.88]  which you'll probably
[3164.88 --> 3165.72]  know is one of my
[3165.72 --> 3166.58]  favorite games
[3166.58 --> 3168.32]  of all time
[3168.32 --> 3169.64]  and it's
[3169.64 --> 3170.44]  it's so cool
[3170.44 --> 3171.38]  because one of
[3171.38 --> 3172.42]  the the Genesis
[3172.42 --> 3173.68]  stories
[3173.68 --> 3175.10]  of Fantasian
[3175.10 --> 3176.24]  is that
[3176.24 --> 3178.48]  some of the
[3178.48 --> 3179.72]  long time
[3179.72 --> 3180.68]  Final Fantasy
[3180.68 --> 3182.06]  peeps
[3182.06 --> 3183.54]  replayed
[3183.54 --> 3184.70]  Final Fantasy 6
[3184.70 --> 3185.26]  they went back
[3185.26 --> 3186.04]  and re-looked at it
[3186.04 --> 3186.54]  and were like
[3186.54 --> 3187.32]  wow
[3187.32 --> 3188.14]  this was really
[3188.14 --> 3188.58]  awesome
[3188.58 --> 3190.28]  we haven't really
[3190.28 --> 3191.02]  done it like this
[3191.02 --> 3191.88]  in a long time
[3191.88 --> 3193.64]  this could be
[3193.64 --> 3194.68]  the last
[3194.68 --> 3195.54]  game
[3195.54 --> 3196.10]  that
[3196.10 --> 3197.26]  legendary
[3197.26 --> 3197.84]  composer
[3197.84 --> 3198.42]  Nubo
[3198.42 --> 3199.12]  actual
[3199.12 --> 3199.66]  Nubu
[3199.66 --> 3200.18]  whatever
[3200.18 --> 3200.68]  I'm not going to
[3200.68 --> 3201.30]  pronounce it right
[3201.30 --> 3203.36]  composes for
[3203.36 --> 3203.98]  like this could be
[3203.98 --> 3204.38]  the last
[3204.38 --> 3205.86]  full score
[3205.86 --> 3206.64]  that he does
[3206.64 --> 3207.52]  and I am
[3207.52 --> 3208.46]  extremely excited
[3208.46 --> 3209.02]  to play it
[3209.02 --> 3210.64]  the problem
[3210.64 --> 3211.56]  for me
[3211.56 --> 3212.82]  is that
[3212.82 --> 3214.42]  I
[3214.42 --> 3216.62]  I get like
[3216.62 --> 3217.32]  anxiety
[3217.32 --> 3218.42]  about being
[3218.42 --> 3219.70]  about having
[3219.70 --> 3220.56]  things platform
[3220.56 --> 3221.00]  locked
[3221.00 --> 3221.96]  like one of the
[3221.96 --> 3222.54]  things that really
[3222.54 --> 3223.34]  bothers me about
[3223.34 --> 3223.78]  the Nintendo
[3223.78 --> 3224.66]  Switch for example
[3224.66 --> 3225.60]  is I'll play a game
[3225.60 --> 3226.58]  on almost anything
[3226.58 --> 3227.32]  other than a
[3227.32 --> 3228.16]  Nintendo console
[3228.16 --> 3228.84]  if I can
[3228.84 --> 3230.04]  because they have
[3230.04 --> 3230.78]  a long and proud
[3230.78 --> 3231.44]  history of doing
[3231.44 --> 3232.14]  stupid things
[3232.14 --> 3233.28]  like deleting
[3233.28 --> 3233.90]  all your cloud
[3233.90 --> 3234.60]  saves and making
[3234.60 --> 3235.26]  them completely
[3235.26 --> 3235.98]  inaccessible
[3235.98 --> 3236.58]  and impossible
[3236.58 --> 3237.06]  to move
[3237.06 --> 3237.42]  to another
[3237.42 --> 3237.96]  device
[3237.96 --> 3238.84]  if you don't
[3238.84 --> 3239.40]  pay for
[3239.40 --> 3240.14]  their service
[3240.14 --> 3242.60]  and in the
[3242.60 --> 3243.20]  same way
[3243.20 --> 3243.64]  you know
[3243.64 --> 3243.98]  I'm really
[3243.98 --> 3244.64]  concerned that
[3244.64 --> 3245.16]  if this game
[3245.16 --> 3245.84]  ever comes out
[3245.84 --> 3246.20]  for another
[3246.20 --> 3246.70]  platform
[3246.70 --> 3248.20]  where for
[3248.20 --> 3248.58]  example
[3248.58 --> 3249.38]  there's
[3249.38 --> 3250.20]  modding support
[3250.20 --> 3250.94]  and I can
[3250.94 --> 3251.54]  play you know
[3251.54 --> 3252.28]  different variants
[3252.28 --> 3252.82]  of it or
[3252.82 --> 3253.32]  whatever the
[3253.32 --> 3253.94]  case may be
[3253.94 --> 3254.74]  I would have
[3254.74 --> 3255.18]  to go and
[3255.18 --> 3255.66]  I'd have to
[3255.66 --> 3256.00]  kind of
[3256.00 --> 3256.48]  completely
[3256.48 --> 3257.32]  restart
[3257.32 --> 3258.08]  which if
[3258.08 --> 3258.46]  it's anywhere
[3258.46 --> 3259.14]  near as good
[3259.14 --> 3259.76]  as I'm hoping
[3259.76 --> 3260.20]  it is
[3260.20 --> 3260.88]  would not be a
[3260.88 --> 3261.32]  problem to
[3261.32 --> 3261.76]  just play it
[3261.76 --> 3262.02]  again
[3262.02 --> 3263.40]  but I
[3263.40 --> 3264.64]  I don't think
[3264.64 --> 3264.92]  they've
[3264.92 --> 3265.56]  acknowledged in
[3265.56 --> 3265.90]  any way
[3265.90 --> 3266.34]  whether it's
[3266.34 --> 3266.54]  going to
[3266.54 --> 3266.98]  come to
[3266.98 --> 3267.58]  other devices
[3267.58 --> 3268.00]  or other
[3268.00 --> 3268.44]  platforms
[3268.44 --> 3269.86]  but I
[3269.86 --> 3271.44]  I don't
[3271.44 --> 3271.56]  know
[3271.56 --> 3271.92]  I just
[3271.92 --> 3273.24]  I'm not
[3273.24 --> 3273.40]  going to
[3273.40 --> 3273.64]  pay for
[3273.64 --> 3274.08]  Apple Arcade
[3274.08 --> 3274.38]  forever
[3274.38 --> 3275.68]  it's that
[3275.68 --> 3276.04]  simple
[3276.04 --> 3276.40]  that ain't
[3276.40 --> 3276.82]  happening
[3276.82 --> 3277.72]  I just
[3277.72 --> 3277.98]  want to
[3277.98 --> 3278.28]  play this
[3278.28 --> 3279.06]  one game
[3279.06 --> 3280.16]  so
[3280.16 --> 3281.80]  I
[3281.80 --> 3281.82]  I
[3281.82 --> 3282.08]  I
[3282.08 --> 3282.10]  I
[3282.10 --> 3282.14]  I
[3282.14 --> 3282.16]  I
[3282.16 --> 3282.42]  kind of
[3282.42 --> 3282.56]  want
[3282.56 --> 3282.68]  to
[3282.68 --> 3282.96]  wait
[3282.96 --> 3283.34]  for it
[3283.34 --> 3283.46]  to
[3283.46 --> 3283.58]  come
[3283.58 --> 3283.70]  to
[3283.70 --> 3283.96]  something
[3283.96 --> 3284.22]  else
[3284.22 --> 3284.40]  yeah
[3284.40 --> 3284.62]  it's
[3284.62 --> 3284.78]  the
[3284.78 --> 3285.30]  diorama
[3285.30 --> 3285.64]  game
[3285.64 --> 3285.92]  the
[3285.92 --> 3286.86]  man
[3286.86 --> 3287.40]  the art
[3287.40 --> 3287.76]  style
[3287.76 --> 3288.14]  is
[3288.14 --> 3289.12]  so
[3289.12 --> 3290.44]  cool
[3290.44 --> 3291.64]  they made
[3291.64 --> 3292.70]  dioramas
[3292.70 --> 3293.24]  and
[3293.24 --> 3293.52]  and then
[3293.52 --> 3294.48]  recreated
[3294.48 --> 3294.90]  them
[3294.90 --> 3296.56]  digitally
[3296.56 --> 3298.24]  like
[3298.24 --> 3298.72]  look at
[3298.72 --> 3299.08]  this
[3299.08 --> 3299.52]  look at
[3299.52 --> 3299.76]  this
[3299.76 --> 3300.36]  style
[3300.36 --> 3300.88]  it is
[3300.88 --> 3301.28]  so
[3301.28 --> 3302.08]  cool
[3302.08 --> 3302.96]  so
[3302.96 --> 3303.12]  they
[3303.12 --> 3303.34]  have
[3303.34 --> 3303.56]  these
[3303.56 --> 3303.76]  like
[3303.76 --> 3304.44]  incredibly
[3304.44 --> 3304.90]  detailed
[3304.90 --> 3305.34]  environments
[3305.34 --> 3305.60]  so
[3305.60 --> 3306.02]  it
[3306.02 --> 3306.20]  ends
[3306.20 --> 3306.38]  up
[3306.38 --> 3306.80]  looking
[3306.80 --> 3307.30]  hyper
[3307.30 --> 3308.36]  photorealistic
[3308.36 --> 3309.12]  even though
[3309.12 --> 3309.54]  it's running
[3309.54 --> 3310.34]  on an
[3310.34 --> 3310.66]  iPhone
[3310.66 --> 3311.02]  or an
[3311.02 --> 3311.60]  Apple TV
[3311.60 --> 3312.06]  or whatever
[3312.06 --> 3312.42]  the case
[3312.42 --> 3312.82]  may be
[3312.82 --> 3314.16]  so
[3314.16 --> 3314.30]  I
[3314.30 --> 3314.60]  really
[3314.60 --> 3315.16]  I
[3315.16 --> 3315.44]  really
[3315.44 --> 3315.76]  really
[3315.76 --> 3316.06]  really
[3316.06 --> 3316.38]  want
[3316.38 --> 3316.64]  to
[3316.64 --> 3317.26]  play
[3317.26 --> 3318.04]  it
[3318.04 --> 3319.06]  I
[3319.06 --> 3319.34]  can't
[3319.34 --> 3319.54]  find
[3319.54 --> 3319.86]  anything
[3319.86 --> 3320.32]  saying
[3320.32 --> 3320.52]  that
[3320.52 --> 3320.76]  it's
[3320.76 --> 3321.26]  technically
[3321.26 --> 3321.52]  an
[3321.52 --> 3321.98]  exclusive
[3321.98 --> 3322.64]  no
[3322.64 --> 3322.82]  you
[3322.82 --> 3323.08]  might
[3323.08 --> 3323.40]  you
[3323.40 --> 3323.66]  might
[3323.66 --> 3324.76]  haven't
[3324.76 --> 3325.30]  acknowledged
[3325.30 --> 3325.92]  when
[3325.92 --> 3326.26]  and if
[3326.26 --> 3326.46]  it'll
[3326.46 --> 3326.60]  ever
[3326.60 --> 3326.78]  go
[3326.78 --> 3327.04]  anywhere
[3327.04 --> 3327.24]  else
[3327.24 --> 3328.04]  so
[3328.04 --> 3328.28]  I'm
[3328.28 --> 3328.48]  just
[3328.48 --> 3329.72]  waiting
[3329.72 --> 3330.06]  to
[3330.06 --> 3330.40]  see

[3330.86 --> 3331.00]  the
[3331.00 --> 3331.38]  reception
[3331.38 --> 3331.78]  is
[3331.78 --> 3333.48]  yeah
[3333.48 --> 3334.32]  so
[3334.32 --> 3334.60]  maybe
[3334.60 --> 3335.00]  if
[3335.00 --> 3335.44]  everyone
[3335.44 --> 3335.80]  holds
[3335.80 --> 3335.98]  out

[3338.10 --> 3338.40]  release
[3338.40 --> 3338.58]  it
[3338.58 --> 3338.70]  on
[3338.70 --> 3339.04]  something
[3339.04 --> 3339.42]  else
[3339.42 --> 3340.70]  yeah

[3342.52 --> 3342.76]  really
[3342.76 --> 3342.96]  wouldn't
[3342.96 --> 3343.10]  want

[3951.52 --> 3951.86]  so
[3951.86 --> 3953.02]  I
[3953.02 --> 3953.12]  don't
[3953.12 --> 3953.32]  know

[3956.94 --> 3957.30]  Anthony
[3957.30 --> 3957.84]  forgets

[3959.18 --> 3959.52]  iPhone
[3959.52 --> 3960.00]  don't
[3960.00 --> 3960.22]  worry

[3961.68 --> 3962.26]  it's
[3962.26 --> 3962.44]  just
[3962.44 --> 3963.58]  stupid
[3963.58 --> 3964.00]  if
[3964.00 --> 3964.12]  I
[3964.12 --> 3964.30]  don't
[3964.30 --> 3964.60]  happen

[3964.90 --> 3965.02]  an
[3965.02 --> 3965.24]  Apple
[3965.24 --> 3965.76]  device
[3965.76 --> 3967.00]  why
[3967.00 --> 3969.14]  you
[3969.14 --> 3969.50]  don't
[3969.50 --> 3969.64]  want

[3970.12 --> 3970.38]  get
[3970.38 --> 3970.68]  one
[3970.68 --> 3971.30]  because
[3971.30 --> 3972.56]  I
[3972.56 --> 3972.74]  just
[3972.74 --> 3973.02]  wouldn't
[3973.02 --> 3973.36]  know
[3973.36 --> 3973.62]  how
[3973.62 --> 3974.00]  great
[3974.00 --> 3974.16]  it
[3974.16 --> 3974.36]  is
[3974.36 --> 3974.56]  over
[3974.56 --> 3974.72]  on
[3974.72 --> 3974.94]  Apple
[3974.94 --> 3975.12]  how
[3975.12 --> 3975.50]  amazing
[3975.50 --> 3975.72]  the
[3975.72 --> 3975.96]  apps
[3975.96 --> 3976.26]  are
[3976.26 --> 3976.82]  like
[3976.82 --> 3976.94]  I
[3976.94 --> 3978.42]  can't
[3978.42 --> 3979.08]  it's
[3979.08 --> 3979.26]  kind of
[3979.26 --> 3979.50]  like how
[3979.50 --> 3979.86]  they used
[3979.86 --> 3980.18]  to not
[3980.18 --> 3980.46]  let you
[3980.46 --> 3980.68]  watch
[3980.68 --> 3980.86]  the
[3980.86 --> 3981.20]  keynote
[3981.20 --> 3982.00]  live
[3982.00 --> 3982.42]  if you
[3982.42 --> 3982.62]  didn't
[3982.62 --> 3982.92]  already
[3982.92 --> 3983.22]  have
[3983.22 --> 3983.32]  an
[3983.32 --> 3983.54]  Apple
[3983.54 --> 3983.92]  device
[3983.92 --> 3984.16]  like
[3984.16 --> 3984.44]  that's
[3984.44 --> 3984.54]  the
[3984.54 --> 3984.84]  kind
[3984.84 --> 3985.04]  of
[3985.04 --> 3985.34]  just
[3985.34 --> 3986.38]  complete
[3986.38 --> 3986.86]  and
[3986.86 --> 3987.26]  utter
[3987.26 --> 3988.00]  arrogance
[3988.00 --> 3988.50]  that
[3988.50 --> 3988.76]  drives
[3988.76 --> 3988.92]  me
[3988.92 --> 3989.22]  crazy
[3989.22 --> 3989.40]  about
[3989.40 --> 3989.56]  this
[3989.56 --> 3989.82]  company
[3989.82 --> 3989.98]  now
[3989.98 --> 3990.24]  clearly
[3990.24 --> 3990.44]  they're
[3990.44 --> 3990.76]  improving
[3990.76 --> 3991.42]  because
[3991.42 --> 3991.64]  they
[3991.64 --> 3991.84]  do
[3991.84 --> 3992.04]  allow
[3992.04 --> 3992.14]  you
[3992.14 --> 3992.22]  to
[3992.22 --> 3992.38]  watch
[3992.38 --> 3992.54]  the
[3992.54 --> 3992.80]  keynote
[3992.80 --> 3993.10]  on
[3993.10 --> 3993.28]  a
[3993.28 --> 3993.52]  different
[3993.52 --> 3993.92]  device
[3993.92 --> 3994.26]  now
[3994.26 --> 3995.08]  it's
[3995.08 --> 3995.28]  like
[3995.28 --> 3996.14]  duh
[3996.14 --> 3996.62]  that's
[3996.62 --> 3996.72]  a
[3996.72 --> 3996.84]  good
[3996.84 --> 3997.28]  idea
[3997.28 --> 3997.90]  but
[3997.90 --> 3998.14]  for
[3998.14 --> 3998.36]  whatever
[3998.36 --> 3998.70]  reason
[3998.70 --> 3998.86]  you
[3998.86 --> 3999.08]  still
[3999.08 --> 3999.76]  can't
[3999.76 --> 4001.38]  read
[4001.38 --> 4001.52]  a
[4001.52 --> 4001.82]  review
[4001.82 --> 4002.00]  of
[4002.00 --> 4002.12]  an
[4002.12 --> 4002.46]  app
[4002.46 --> 4002.80]  if
[4002.80 --> 4002.90]  you
[4002.90 --> 4003.70]  don't
[4003.70 --> 4003.94]  own
[4003.94 --> 4004.08]  the
[4004.08 --> 4004.34]  phone
[4004.34 --> 4004.78]  for
[4004.78 --> 4005.12]  some
[4005.12 --> 4005.42]  reason
[4005.42 --> 4005.64]  it's
[4005.64 --> 4005.90]  just
[4005.90 --> 4007.62]  oh
[4007.62 --> 4009.24]  all right
[4009.24 --> 4010.28]  maybe
[4010.28 --> 4010.64]  there's a
[4010.64 --> 4010.92]  great
[4010.92 --> 4011.36]  reason
[4011.36 --> 4011.82]  okay
[4011.82 --> 4012.62]  maybe
[4012.62 --> 4013.20]  maybe
[4013.20 --> 4013.80]  you know
[4013.80 --> 4014.10]  Phil
[4014.10 --> 4014.44]  Schiller
[4014.44 --> 4014.86]  is gonna
[4014.86 --> 4015.68]  talk about
[4015.68 --> 4015.86]  it
[4015.86 --> 4016.10]  in the
[4016.10 --> 4016.40]  next
[4016.40 --> 4016.84]  big
[4016.84 --> 4017.16]  keynote
[4017.16 --> 4017.44]  on
[4017.44 --> 4017.56]  the
[4017.56 --> 4018.04]  20th
[4018.04 --> 4018.44]  and
[4018.44 --> 4018.56]  be
[4018.56 --> 4018.80]  like
[4018.80 --> 4019.10]  and
[4019.10 --> 4019.36]  here's
[4019.36 --> 4019.44]  a
[4019.44 --> 4019.60]  big
[4019.60 --> 4019.98]  change
[4019.98 --> 4020.30]  now
[4020.30 --> 4020.50]  we
[4020.50 --> 4020.82]  actually
[4020.82 --> 4021.12]  want
[4021.12 --> 4021.36]  people
[4021.36 --> 4021.50]  to
[4021.50 --> 4021.66]  buy
[4021.66 --> 4022.10]  iPhones
[4022.10 --> 4022.44]  so
[4022.44 --> 4022.60]  we're
[4022.60 --> 4022.86]  making
[4022.86 --> 4023.00]  it
[4023.00 --> 4023.10]  so
[4023.10 --> 4023.22]  they
[4023.22 --> 4023.34]  can
[4023.34 --> 4023.52]  see
[4023.52 --> 4023.72]  what's
[4023.72 --> 4023.80]  so
[4023.80 --> 4023.96]  great
[4023.96 --> 4024.12]  about
[4024.12 --> 4024.24]  an
[4024.24 --> 4024.48]  iPhone
[4024.48 --> 4025.06]  without
[4025.06 --> 4025.42]  already
[4025.42 --> 4025.66]  owning
[4025.66 --> 4025.90]  one
[4025.90 --> 4026.18]  it's
[4026.18 --> 4026.34]  going to
[4026.34 --> 4026.44]  be
[4026.44 --> 4026.78]  amazing
[4026.78 --> 4028.36]  someone
[4028.36 --> 4028.98]  pointed
[4028.98 --> 4029.20]  out
[4029.20 --> 4029.44]  that
[4029.44 --> 4029.80]  some
[4029.80 --> 4030.22]  other
[4030.22 --> 4030.66]  apps
[4030.66 --> 4031.02]  have
[4031.02 --> 4031.50]  reviews
[4031.50 --> 4031.96]  available
[4031.96 --> 4032.54]  online
[4032.54 --> 4033.02]  yep
[4033.02 --> 4033.88]  just
[4033.88 --> 4034.16]  not
[4034.16 --> 4034.50]  all
[4034.50 --> 4034.66]  of
[4034.66 --> 4034.86]  them
[4034.86 --> 4035.68]  I
[4035.68 --> 4035.86]  think
[4035.86 --> 4035.98]  it
[4035.98 --> 4036.10]  may
[4036.10 --> 4036.22]  be
[4036.22 --> 4036.76]  arcade
[4036.76 --> 4037.10]  ones
[4037.10 --> 4038.36]  don't
[4038.36 --> 4038.92]  I'm
[4038.92 --> 4039.12]  not
[4039.12 --> 4039.38]  sure
[4039.38 --> 4040.34]  exactly
[4040.34 --> 4040.98]  what
[4040.98 --> 4041.24]  the
[4041.24 --> 4041.50]  rules
[4041.50 --> 4041.78]  are
[4041.78 --> 4041.98]  but
[4041.98 --> 4042.20]  like
[4042.20 --> 4042.50]  why
[4042.50 --> 4042.78]  that
[4042.78 --> 4043.20]  differential
[4043.20 --> 4043.62]  exists
[4043.62 --> 4043.90]  it
[4043.90 --> 4044.50]  doesn't
[4044.50 --> 4045.04]  matter
[4045.04 --> 4045.46]  it
[4045.46 --> 4045.68]  just
[4045.68 --> 4046.08]  doesn't
[4046.08 --> 4046.40]  matter
[4046.40 --> 4046.60]  what
[4046.60 --> 4046.76]  the
[4046.76 --> 4047.02]  reason
[4047.02 --> 4047.24]  is
[4047.24 --> 4047.48]  for
[4047.48 --> 4047.62]  it
[4047.62 --> 4047.82]  it's
[4047.82 --> 4047.96]  a
[4047.96 --> 4048.30]  bad
[4048.30 --> 4048.66]  reason
[4048.66 --> 4048.94]  it's
[4048.94 --> 4049.36]  stupid
[4049.36 --> 4049.56]  and
[4049.56 --> 4049.66]  they
[4049.66 --> 4049.82]  need
[4049.82 --> 4049.98]  to
[4049.98 --> 4050.74]  stop
[4050.74 --> 4051.86]  I love
[4051.86 --> 4052.02]  how
[4052.02 --> 4052.68]  QTrade
[4052.68 --> 4053.28]  Investor
[4053.28 --> 4053.68]  has a

[4057.48 --> 4058.72]  you can invest
[4058.72 --> 4059.10]  when you're
[4059.10 --> 4059.76]  4 but
[4059.76 --> 4060.04]  if you're
[4060.04 --> 4060.36]  3
[4060.36 --> 4061.10]  not a chance
[4061.10 --> 4061.60]  this is my
[4061.60 --> 4062.04]  official
[4062.04 --> 4062.46]  favorite
[4062.46 --> 4063.02]  comment on
[4063.02 --> 4063.12]  the
[4063.12 --> 4063.28]  when
[4063.28 --> 4063.48]  show
[4063.48 --> 4063.90]  of all
[4063.90 --> 4064.32]  time
[4064.32 --> 4065.16]  Siy
[4065.16 --> 4065.80]  Seth
[4065.80 --> 4066.08]  says
[4066.08 --> 4066.32]  where
[4066.32 --> 4066.44]  are
[4066.44 --> 4066.58]  the
[4066.58 --> 4067.36]  timestamps
[4067.36 --> 4068.90]  the
[4068.90 --> 4069.16]  show
[4069.16 --> 4069.34]  is
[4069.34 --> 4069.86]  live
[4069.86 --> 4070.66]  the
[4070.66 --> 4070.94]  show
[4070.94 --> 4071.12]  is
[4071.12 --> 4071.52]  actually
[4071.52 --> 4072.06]  live
[4072.06 --> 4072.78]  right
[4072.78 --> 4073.22]  now
[4073.22 --> 4074.90]  oh
[4074.90 --> 4075.94]  man
[4075.94 --> 4076.68]  oh
[4076.68 --> 4077.04]  that's
[4077.04 --> 4077.30]  great
[4077.30 --> 4077.98]  okay
[4077.98 --> 4079.98]  let's
[4079.98 --> 4080.44]  go ahead
[4080.44 --> 4080.88]  and jump
[4080.88 --> 4081.32]  into our
[4081.32 --> 4081.60]  next
[4081.60 --> 4082.00]  topic
[4082.00 --> 4082.56]  here
[4082.56 --> 4084.02]  Epic
[4084.02 --> 4084.62]  Games
[4084.62 --> 4085.04]  store
[4085.04 --> 4085.24]  is
[4085.24 --> 4085.64]  apparently
[4085.64 --> 4086.24]  bleeding
[4086.24 --> 4086.78]  money
[4086.78 --> 4088.04]  okay
[4088.04 --> 4088.58]  I
[4088.58 --> 4089.22]  think
[4089.22 --> 4089.46]  this
[4089.46 --> 4089.80]  headline
[4089.80 --> 4090.14]  is
[4090.14 --> 4090.90]  incredibly
[4090.90 --> 4091.50]  incorrect
[4091.50 --> 4092.58]  I
[4092.58 --> 4092.94]  think
[4092.94 --> 4093.16]  it's
[4093.16 --> 4093.78]  more
[4093.78 --> 4094.08]  so
[4094.08 --> 4095.32]  something
[4095.32 --> 4095.62]  that I
[4095.62 --> 4095.80]  would
[4095.80 --> 4096.48]  try to
[4096.48 --> 4096.72]  compare
[4096.72 --> 4096.86]  it
[4096.86 --> 4097.04]  to
[4097.04 --> 4097.48]  have
[4097.48 --> 4097.62]  you
[4097.62 --> 4097.80]  seen

[4152.60 --> 4152.92]  so
[4152.92 --> 4153.48]  the

[4243.92 --> 4244.74]  argument to be
[4244.74 --> 4245.32]  like no
[4245.32 --> 4246.36]  we shouldn't
[4246.36 --> 4246.76]  we shouldn't
[4246.76 --> 4247.34]  take a smaller
[4247.34 --> 4247.72]  cut
[4247.72 --> 4249.12]  they lose
[4249.12 --> 4249.64]  money
[4249.64 --> 4251.10]  what
[4251.10 --> 4251.72]  well
[4251.72 --> 4252.26]  I mean
[4252.26 --> 4252.86]  I can see
[4252.86 --> 4253.20]  that being
[4253.20 --> 4253.52]  part of
[4253.52 --> 4253.64]  their
[4253.64 --> 4254.00]  argument
[4254.00 --> 4254.30]  epic
[4254.30 --> 4254.54]  game
[4254.54 --> 4254.74]  store
[4254.74 --> 4255.02]  loses
[4255.02 --> 4255.38]  money
[4255.38 --> 4255.60]  with
[4255.60 --> 4255.78]  their
[4255.78 --> 4256.08]  lower
[4256.08 --> 4256.54]  take
[4256.54 --> 4256.92]  so
[4256.92 --> 4257.20]  clearly
[4257.20 --> 4257.48]  that's
[4257.48 --> 4257.74]  not a
[4257.74 --> 4258.10]  sustainable
[4258.10 --> 4258.52]  business
[4258.52 --> 4258.86]  model
[4258.86 --> 4259.38]  but then
[4259.38 --> 4259.74]  they go
[4259.74 --> 4260.36]  the reason
[4260.36 --> 4260.80]  they're losing
[4260.80 --> 4261.24]  money
[4261.24 --> 4262.12]  is paying
[4262.12 --> 4262.92]  for exclusives
[4262.92 --> 4263.48]  which is part
[4263.48 --> 4263.78]  of gaining
[4263.78 --> 4264.38]  traction for
[4264.38 --> 4264.96]  their platform
[4264.96 --> 4265.66]  whether you like
[4265.66 --> 4266.12]  it or not
[4266.12 --> 4266.66]  it is
[4266.66 --> 4268.08]  and giving
[4268.08 --> 4268.84]  away the
[4268.84 --> 4269.52]  product
[4269.52 --> 4270.68]  that's not
[4270.68 --> 4271.98]  that's not
[4271.98 --> 4272.40]  they don't
[4272.40 --> 4272.68]  they didn't
[4272.68 --> 4273.42]  have to do
[4273.42 --> 4273.82]  that
[4273.82 --> 4275.30]  they chose
[4275.30 --> 4275.80]  to do
[4275.80 --> 4275.98]  that
[4275.98 --> 4276.24]  that was
[4276.24 --> 4276.84]  voluntary
[4276.84 --> 4277.52]  it's not
[4277.52 --> 4278.12]  that doesn't
[4278.12 --> 4278.42]  make it
[4278.42 --> 4279.24]  unsustainable
[4279.24 --> 4280.16]  if anything
[4280.16 --> 4281.30]  this tells
[4281.30 --> 4281.60]  us
[4281.60 --> 4282.30]  that based
[4282.30 --> 4282.62]  on
[4282.62 --> 4283.14]  epic's
[4283.14 --> 4283.36]  take
[4283.36 --> 4283.60]  which is
[4283.60 --> 4283.82]  what is
[4283.82 --> 4284.00]  it like
[4284.00 --> 4284.50]  12%
[4284.50 --> 4284.82]  or something
[4284.82 --> 4285.26]  like that
[4285.26 --> 4286.06]  I can't
[4286.06 --> 4286.26]  remember
[4286.26 --> 4286.70]  it's a lot
[4286.70 --> 4287.06]  lower than
[4287.06 --> 4287.58]  30%
[4287.58 --> 4288.36]  based on
[4288.36 --> 4288.78]  epic's
[4288.78 --> 4289.04]  take
[4289.04 --> 4289.52]  it is
[4289.52 --> 4289.90]  clearly
[4289.90 --> 4290.58]  possible
[4290.58 --> 4291.54]  to sustain
[4291.54 --> 4292.02]  the server
[4292.02 --> 4292.66]  infrastructure
[4292.66 --> 4293.50]  and payment
[4293.50 --> 4293.98]  processing
[4293.98 --> 4294.62]  infrastructure
[4294.62 --> 4295.46]  and validation
[4295.46 --> 4296.10]  infrastructure
[4296.10 --> 4297.14]  that you need
[4297.14 --> 4297.64]  in order to
[4297.64 --> 4298.18]  run a
[4298.18 --> 4298.54]  marketplace
[4298.54 --> 4299.82]  if anything
[4299.82 --> 4300.64]  this proves
[4300.64 --> 4301.06]  epic's
[4301.06 --> 4301.30]  point
[4301.30 --> 4301.80]  that the
[4301.80 --> 4302.30]  30%
[4302.30 --> 4302.58]  take
[4302.58 --> 4302.74]  is
[4302.74 --> 4303.64]  entirely
[4303.64 --> 4304.22]  unnecessary
[4304.22 --> 4305.36]  in fact
[4305.36 --> 4305.82]  Apple's
[4305.82 --> 4306.88]  own numbers
[4306.88 --> 4307.34]  prove that
[4307.34 --> 4307.82]  it's entirely
[4307.82 --> 4308.24]  unnecessary
[4308.24 --> 4308.74]  that business
[4308.74 --> 4309.20]  unit is
[4309.20 --> 4310.10]  so profitable
[4310.10 --> 4310.54]  they're a public
[4310.54 --> 4310.90]  company
[4310.90 --> 4311.26]  you can just
[4311.26 --> 4311.54]  look this
[4311.54 --> 4312.02]  stuff up
[4312.02 --> 4312.92]  like it's
[4312.92 --> 4313.38]  in their
[4313.38 --> 4314.06]  quarterly
[4314.06 --> 4314.68]  reports
[4314.68 --> 4315.78]  so
[4315.78 --> 4316.66]  you know
[4316.66 --> 4317.04]  I think
[4317.04 --> 4317.42]  it's no
[4317.42 --> 4317.78]  secret
[4317.78 --> 4318.56]  that whatever
[4318.56 --> 4319.24]  my
[4319.24 --> 4319.92]  you know
[4319.92 --> 4320.82]  past might
[4320.82 --> 4321.38]  be with
[4321.38 --> 4322.22]  Mr. Sweeney
[4322.22 --> 4323.54]  and whatever
[4323.54 --> 4324.16]  my feelings
[4324.16 --> 4324.60]  might be
[4324.60 --> 4325.12]  about Epic
[4325.12 --> 4325.76]  Game Store
[4325.76 --> 4326.54]  about Apple
[4326.54 --> 4327.82]  I think
[4327.82 --> 4328.52]  that Epic
[4328.52 --> 4329.62]  is in the
[4329.62 --> 4330.70]  right here
[4330.70 --> 4332.42]  whether they
[4332.42 --> 4332.98]  are legally
[4332.98 --> 4333.68]  right or not
[4333.68 --> 4334.12]  is going to
[4334.12 --> 4334.44]  be up for
[4334.44 --> 4334.82]  the courts
[4334.82 --> 4335.44]  to decide
[4335.44 --> 4335.98]  but I think
[4335.98 --> 4336.82]  if you look
[4336.82 --> 4337.40]  at it from
[4337.40 --> 4337.92]  what was
[4337.92 --> 4338.74]  the spirit
[4338.74 --> 4340.12]  of the
[4340.12 --> 4340.48]  creation
[4340.48 --> 4341.20]  of antitrust
[4341.20 --> 4341.50]  law
[4341.50 --> 4342.10]  what was
[4342.10 --> 4342.68]  the spirit
[4342.68 --> 4343.78]  of anti
[4343.78 --> 4344.46]  monopoly
[4344.46 --> 4345.44]  legislation
[4345.44 --> 4346.38]  I think
[4346.38 --> 4347.04]  Epic is
[4347.04 --> 4347.92]  absolutely
[4347.92 --> 4348.48]  right
[4348.48 --> 4348.88]  and I
[4348.88 --> 4349.72]  sincerely hope
[4349.72 --> 4350.26]  they win
[4350.26 --> 4350.86]  not just
[4350.86 --> 4351.50]  for Epic's
[4351.50 --> 4351.66]  sake
[4351.66 --> 4352.18]  I'm not
[4352.18 --> 4352.72]  invested in
[4352.72 --> 4352.86]  Epic
[4352.86 --> 4353.14]  I don't
[4353.14 --> 4353.36]  care
[4353.36 --> 4354.22]  but for
[4354.22 --> 4354.54]  the sake
[4354.54 --> 4354.84]  of the
[4354.84 --> 4355.32]  entire
[4355.32 --> 4355.78]  industry
[4355.78 --> 4356.12]  because
[4356.12 --> 4356.54]  the way
[4356.54 --> 4356.90]  that Apple
[4356.90 --> 4357.14]  has been
[4357.14 --> 4357.56]  behaving
[4357.56 --> 4359.00]  if
[4359.00 --> 4359.76]  Microsoft
[4359.76 --> 4360.28]  had been
[4360.28 --> 4360.62]  behaving
[4360.62 --> 4361.04]  like this
[4361.04 --> 4361.34]  in the
[4361.34 --> 4361.94]  90s
[4361.94 --> 4362.74]  they would
[4362.74 --> 4363.04]  have been
[4363.04 --> 4363.78]  broken up
[4363.78 --> 4364.98]  like it's
[4364.98 --> 4365.18]  just
[4365.18 --> 4366.04]  I don't
[4366.04 --> 4366.58]  get it
[4366.58 --> 4366.98]  I don't
[4366.98 --> 4367.60]  understand
[4367.60 --> 4368.46]  why
[4368.46 --> 4369.24]  Microsoft
[4369.24 --> 4369.74]  who to be
[4369.74 --> 4370.08]  clear
[4370.08 --> 4370.58]  has done
[4370.58 --> 4371.64]  some shady
[4371.64 --> 4372.22]  stuff over
[4372.22 --> 4372.70]  the years
[4372.70 --> 4373.76]  but if
[4373.76 --> 4374.32]  Microsoft
[4374.32 --> 4374.92]  got punished
[4374.92 --> 4375.14]  the way
[4375.14 --> 4375.52]  they did
[4375.52 --> 4376.32]  I don't
[4376.32 --> 4376.76]  understand
[4376.76 --> 4377.30]  why Apple
[4377.30 --> 4377.56]  has
[4377.56 --> 4378.12]  comparatively
[4378.12 --> 4378.50]  speaking
[4378.50 --> 4379.02]  gotten an
[4379.02 --> 4379.52]  absolutely
[4379.52 --> 4380.56]  free ride
[4380.56 --> 4381.76]  and part
[4381.76 --> 4381.92]  of it
[4381.92 --> 4382.12]  is that
[4382.12 --> 4382.46]  Microsoft
[4382.46 --> 4383.04]  gets a
[4383.04 --> 4383.40]  free ride
[4383.40 --> 4383.84]  now too
[4383.84 --> 4384.12]  so
[4384.12 --> 4384.92]  enforcement
[4384.92 --> 4385.70]  is down
[4385.70 --> 4386.12]  enforcement
[4386.12 --> 4386.58]  sucks
[4386.58 --> 4387.32]  so that's
[4387.32 --> 4387.62]  what needs
[4387.62 --> 4388.06]  to improve
[4388.06 --> 4388.32]  and I
[4388.32 --> 4388.62]  hope
[4388.62 --> 4389.06]  that will
[4389.06 --> 4389.34]  be the
[4389.34 --> 4389.74]  result
[4389.74 --> 4390.14]  of Epic
[4390.14 --> 4390.44]  Games
[4390.44 --> 4390.82]  winning
[4390.82 --> 4391.06]  this
[4391.06 --> 4391.40]  battle
[4391.40 --> 4392.06]  unless
[4392.06 --> 4392.34]  they
[4392.34 --> 4392.68]  just
[4392.68 --> 4393.02]  lose
[4393.02 --> 4393.24]  I don't
[4393.24 --> 4394.08]  know
[4394.08 --> 4394.46]  speaking
[4394.46 --> 4394.90]  of losing
[4394.90 --> 4395.80]  Twitch
[4395.80 --> 4396.26]  streamers
[4396.26 --> 4396.84]  are losing
[4396.84 --> 4397.66]  millions
[4397.66 --> 4399.20]  of followers
[4399.20 --> 4400.18]  so this
[4400.18 --> 4400.50]  is the
[4400.50 --> 4400.84]  same
[4400.84 --> 4401.90]  thing that
[4401.90 --> 4402.16]  happens
[4402.16 --> 4402.72]  on YouTube
[4402.72 --> 4404.02]  YouTube
[4404.02 --> 4404.28]  has just
[4404.28 --> 4404.68]  been doing
[4404.68 --> 4404.92]  it
[4404.92 --> 4405.42]  forever
[4405.42 --> 4406.18]  and
[4406.18 --> 4406.54]  Twitch
[4406.54 --> 4406.70]  is
[4406.70 --> 4406.88]  just
[4406.88 --> 4407.08]  starting
[4407.08 --> 4407.30]  to do
[4407.30 --> 4407.38]  it
[4407.38 --> 4407.62]  now
[4407.62 --> 4408.70]  essentially
[4408.70 --> 4409.00]  there's
[4409.00 --> 4409.28]  been a
[4409.28 --> 4409.70]  correction
[4409.70 --> 4410.34]  there's
[4410.34 --> 4410.58]  tons
[4410.58 --> 4410.80]  of
[4410.80 --> 4411.14]  bots
[4411.14 --> 4411.70]  on
[4411.70 --> 4412.02]  Twitch
[4412.02 --> 4412.32]  there's
[4412.32 --> 4412.44]  tons
[4412.44 --> 4412.60]  of
[4412.60 --> 4412.90]  bots
[4412.90 --> 4413.82]  everywhere
[4413.82 --> 4414.52]  there's
[4414.52 --> 4414.66]  tons
[4414.66 --> 4414.74]  of
[4414.74 --> 4414.88]  bots
[4414.88 --> 4415.02]  on
[4415.02 --> 4415.48]  every
[4415.48 --> 4415.82]  social
[4415.82 --> 4416.06]  media
[4416.06 --> 4416.40]  platform
[4416.40 --> 4416.68]  you can
[4416.68 --> 4417.08]  possibly
[4417.08 --> 4417.48]  imagine
[4417.48 --> 4418.50]  and
[4418.50 --> 4419.14]  Twitch
[4419.14 --> 4419.36]  is
[4419.36 --> 4419.82]  removing
[4419.82 --> 4420.32]  those
[4420.32 --> 4420.72]  from
[4420.72 --> 4421.22]  people's
[4421.22 --> 4421.56]  follower
[4421.56 --> 4422.10]  numbers
[4422.10 --> 4423.26]  in a
[4423.26 --> 4423.74]  huge
[4423.74 --> 4423.94]  amount
[4423.94 --> 4424.32]  of cases
[4424.32 --> 4424.54]  I
[4424.54 --> 4425.00]  seriously
[4425.00 --> 4425.44]  doubt
[4425.44 --> 4425.96]  many
[4425.96 --> 4426.30]  of these
[4426.30 --> 4426.52]  big
[4426.52 --> 4426.94]  players
[4426.94 --> 4427.40]  had
[4427.40 --> 4427.92]  any
[4427.92 --> 4428.64]  personal
[4428.64 --> 4429.18]  investment
[4429.18 --> 4429.80]  at all
[4429.80 --> 4430.54]  in these
[4430.54 --> 4430.88]  bots
[4430.88 --> 4431.10]  that are
[4431.10 --> 4431.26]  being
[4431.26 --> 4431.72]  removed
[4431.72 --> 4432.96]  and this
[4432.96 --> 4433.30]  is pointed
[4433.30 --> 4433.64]  out in
[4433.64 --> 4434.02]  the notes
[4434.02 --> 4434.40]  actually
[4439.28 --> 4439.64]  that
[4439.64 --> 4440.08]  creator
[4440.08 --> 4440.62]  a lot
[4440.62 --> 4440.70]  of
[4440.70 --> 4440.82]  these
[4440.82 --> 4441.10]  creators
[4441.10 --> 4441.32]  will
[4441.32 --> 4441.66]  have
[4441.66 --> 4442.64]  follow
[4442.64 --> 4443.38]  requirements
[4443.38 --> 4443.72]  to be
[4443.72 --> 4443.96]  able to
[4443.96 --> 4444.30]  talk
[4444.30 --> 4444.50]  in
[4444.50 --> 4444.86]  chat
[4444.86 --> 4445.30]  and a
[4445.30 --> 4445.38]  lot
[4445.38 --> 4445.44]  of
[4445.44 --> 4445.58]  these
[4445.58 --> 4445.86]  bots
[4445.86 --> 4446.02]  are
[4446.02 --> 4446.38]  probably
[4446.38 --> 4446.74]  used
[4446.74 --> 4446.94]  to
[4446.94 --> 4447.26]  troll
[4447.26 --> 4448.58]  so
[4448.58 --> 4448.82]  they
[4448.82 --> 4449.40]  follow
[4449.40 --> 4449.64]  the
[4449.64 --> 4449.98]  creator
[4449.98 --> 4450.40]  so
[4450.40 --> 4450.54]  that
[4450.54 --> 4450.70]  they
[4450.70 --> 4450.90]  can
[4450.90 --> 4451.66]  troll
[4451.66 --> 4451.78]  the
[4451.78 --> 4452.08]  creator
[4452.08 --> 4452.50]  or
[4452.50 --> 4452.94]  spam
[4452.94 --> 4453.82]  them
[4453.82 --> 4454.02]  or
[4454.02 --> 4454.60]  try
[4454.60 --> 4454.98]  to
[4454.98 --> 4456.00]  promote
[4456.00 --> 4456.34]  other
[4456.34 --> 4456.86]  streams
[4456.86 --> 4457.06]  or
[4457.06 --> 4457.36]  promote
[4457.36 --> 4458.00]  products
[4458.00 --> 4458.20]  or
[4458.20 --> 4458.42]  do
[4458.42 --> 4458.80]  whatever
[4458.80 --> 4459.32]  there
[4459.32 --> 4459.46]  was
[4459.46 --> 4459.64]  a
[4459.64 --> 4460.66]  while
[4460.66 --> 4460.90]  ago
[4460.90 --> 4461.02]  I
[4461.02 --> 4461.14]  think
[4461.14 --> 4461.36]  close
[4461.36 --> 4461.50]  to
[4461.50 --> 4461.62]  a
[4461.62 --> 4461.76]  year
[4461.76 --> 4461.98]  ago
[4461.98 --> 4462.42]  you
[4462.42 --> 4462.62]  couldn't
[4462.62 --> 4462.74]  go
[4462.74 --> 4462.86]  to
[4462.86 --> 4463.08]  any
[4463.08 --> 4463.40]  channel
[4463.40 --> 4463.58]  on
[4463.58 --> 4463.84]  Twitch
[4469.28 --> 4469.72]  and
[4469.72 --> 4470.00]  trying
[4470.00 --> 4470.10]  to
[4470.10 --> 4470.58]  post
[4470.58 --> 4470.98]  links
[4470.98 --> 4471.22]  in
[4471.22 --> 4471.52]  creative
[4471.52 --> 4471.96]  ways
[4471.96 --> 4472.30]  like
[4472.30 --> 4473.12]  typing
[4473.12 --> 4473.36]  out
[4473.36 --> 4473.52]  the
[4473.52 --> 4473.94]  dot
[4473.94 --> 4474.12]  or
[4474.12 --> 4474.40]  whatever
[4474.40 --> 4474.84]  else
[4474.84 --> 4475.94]  and
[4475.94 --> 4476.28]  they're
[4476.28 --> 4476.46]  just
[4476.46 --> 4476.84]  spamming
[4476.84 --> 4476.98]  for
[4476.98 --> 4477.16]  different
[4477.16 --> 4477.58]  products
[4477.58 --> 4477.76]  or
[4477.76 --> 4478.16]  whatever
[4478.16 --> 4478.36]  the
[4478.36 --> 4478.54]  heck
[4478.54 --> 4478.84]  else
[4478.84 --> 4479.10]  so
[4479.10 --> 4479.44]  yeah
[4479.44 --> 4479.72]  I
[4479.72 --> 4479.92]  don't
[4479.92 --> 4480.20]  think
[4480.20 --> 4481.50]  this
[4481.50 --> 4481.74]  is
[4481.74 --> 4482.52]  new
[4482.52 --> 4482.76]  it's
[4482.76 --> 4482.92]  just
[4482.92 --> 4483.08]  new
[4483.08 --> 4483.22]  to
[4483.22 --> 4483.54]  Twitch
[4483.54 --> 4483.84]  and
[4483.84 --> 4483.96]  I
[4483.96 --> 4484.08]  don't
[4484.08 --> 4484.26]  think
[4484.26 --> 4486.20]  you
[4486.20 --> 4486.34]  should
[4486.34 --> 4486.66]  look
[4486.66 --> 4486.78]  at
[4486.78 --> 4486.96]  any
[4486.96 --> 4487.08]  of
[4487.08 --> 4487.18]  the
[4487.18 --> 4487.58]  creators
[4487.58 --> 4487.94]  that
[4487.94 --> 4488.50]  have
[4488.50 --> 4488.88]  lost
[4488.88 --> 4489.32]  followers
[4489.32 --> 4489.56]  and be
[4489.56 --> 4489.68]  like
[4489.68 --> 4490.04]  what
[4490.04 --> 4490.16]  were
[4490.16 --> 4490.32]  they
[4490.32 --> 4490.60]  doing
[4490.60 --> 4490.80]  because
[4490.80 --> 4491.24]  it's
[4491.24 --> 4491.52]  probably
[4491.52 --> 4491.90]  nothing
[4491.90 --> 4492.18]  big
[4492.18 --> 4492.58]  numbers
[4492.58 --> 4492.86]  though
[4492.86 --> 4493.66]  XQC
[4499.28 --> 4500.12]  now to be
[4500.12 --> 4500.46]  clear
[4500.46 --> 4501.06]  we're not
[4501.06 --> 4501.70]  talking about
[4501.70 --> 4502.44]  subscribers
[4502.44 --> 4503.22]  those are
[4503.22 --> 4503.58]  people who
[4503.58 --> 4504.04]  pay
[4504.04 --> 4504.42]  and you
[4504.42 --> 4504.66]  actually
[4504.66 --> 4505.16]  make money
[4505.16 --> 4505.42]  from
[4505.42 --> 4506.30]  so losing
[4506.30 --> 4507.00]  followers
[4507.00 --> 4507.86]  is not
[4507.86 --> 4508.46]  really
[4508.46 --> 4509.82]  meaningful
[4509.82 --> 4510.44]  and
[4510.44 --> 4510.98]  honestly
[4510.98 --> 4511.58]  if
[4511.58 --> 4512.76]  Twitch
[4512.76 --> 4513.04]  had been
[4513.04 --> 4513.54]  keeping up
[4513.54 --> 4513.82]  with this
[4513.82 --> 4514.48]  all along
[4514.48 --> 4514.84]  in the way
[4514.84 --> 4515.34]  that YouTube
[4515.34 --> 4516.02]  tries to
[4516.02 --> 4516.40]  once in a
[4516.40 --> 4516.58]  while
[4516.58 --> 4517.30]  where they'll
[4517.30 --> 4518.36]  purge
[4518.36 --> 4518.98]  subscribers
[4518.98 --> 4519.60]  whether the
[4519.60 --> 4520.04]  account has
[4520.04 --> 4520.72]  become inactive
[4520.72 --> 4521.78]  or it was
[4521.78 --> 4522.64]  fake in the
[4522.64 --> 4523.46]  first place
[4523.46 --> 4523.98]  or whatever
[4523.98 --> 4524.38]  the case
[4524.38 --> 4524.68]  may be
[4524.68 --> 4524.96]  they will
[4524.96 --> 4525.66]  often purge
[4525.66 --> 4525.80]  them
[4525.80 --> 4526.12]  so you'll
[4526.12 --> 4526.54]  see those
[4526.54 --> 4526.96]  corrections
[4526.96 --> 4527.38]  especially
[4527.38 --> 4527.94]  back when
[4527.94 --> 4528.54]  Social Blade
[4528.54 --> 4529.40]  used to
[4529.40 --> 4530.06]  expose
[4530.06 --> 4530.60]  everyone's
[4530.60 --> 4530.88]  exact
[4530.88 --> 4531.42]  subscriber
[4531.42 --> 4531.82]  count
[4531.82 --> 4532.18]  or rather
[4532.18 --> 4532.44]  when
[4532.44 --> 4533.08]  YouTube
[4533.08 --> 4533.50]  through the
[4533.50 --> 4533.86]  API
[4533.86 --> 4534.28]  used to
[4534.28 --> 4534.60]  expose
[4534.60 --> 4535.00]  everyone's
[4535.00 --> 4535.28]  exact
[4535.28 --> 4535.70]  subscriber
[4535.70 --> 4536.02]  count
[4536.02 --> 4536.64]  and Social Blade
[4536.64 --> 4537.00]  allowed you
[4537.00 --> 4537.50]  to look back
[4537.50 --> 4537.94]  at people's
[4537.94 --> 4538.24]  history
[4538.24 --> 4539.02]  you could see
[4539.02 --> 4539.36]  there'd be
[4539.36 --> 4540.30]  days of
[4540.30 --> 4541.02]  very very
[4541.02 --> 4541.46]  large
[4541.46 --> 4541.90]  subscriber
[4541.90 --> 4542.44]  corrections
[4542.44 --> 4542.86]  where there's
[4542.86 --> 4544.26]  no way
[4544.26 --> 4545.04]  that
[4545.04 --> 4546.26]  you know
[4546.26 --> 4548.50]  30,000
[4548.50 --> 4548.98]  people
[4548.98 --> 4549.88]  unsubscribed
[4549.88 --> 4550.14]  from
[4550.14 --> 4551.16]  Phil DeFranco
[4551.16 --> 4551.64]  that day
[4551.64 --> 4552.04]  or whatever
[4552.04 --> 4552.50]  the case
[4552.50 --> 4552.90]  may be
[4552.90 --> 4553.36]  it just
[4553.36 --> 4553.62]  doesn't
[4553.62 --> 4554.06]  make any
[4554.06 --> 4554.40]  sense
[4554.40 --> 4555.36]  so what
[4555.36 --> 4555.72]  actually
[4555.72 --> 4556.08]  happened
[4556.08 --> 4556.32]  is they
[4556.32 --> 4556.66]  were going
[4556.66 --> 4556.86]  through
[4556.86 --> 4557.04]  and they
[4557.04 --> 4557.30]  were getting
[4557.30 --> 4557.62]  rid of
[4557.62 --> 4557.86]  you know
[4557.86 --> 4558.14]  maybe
[4558.14 --> 4558.68]  the account
[4558.68 --> 4559.08]  belongs to
[4559.08 --> 4559.54]  a deceased
[4559.54 --> 4559.94]  person
[4559.94 --> 4560.44]  I don't
[4560.44 --> 4560.72]  know
[4560.72 --> 4562.24]  but this
[4562.24 --> 4562.54]  is
[4562.54 --> 4563.00]  oh this
[4563.00 --> 4563.22]  is
[4563.22 --> 4563.48]  this
[4563.48 --> 4563.64]  is
[4563.64 --> 4563.80]  great
[4563.80 --> 4563.96]  I'm
[4563.96 --> 4564.18]  actually
[4564.18 --> 4564.44]  going to
[4564.44 --> 4564.82]  look this
[4564.82 --> 4565.20]  up real
[4565.20 --> 4565.72]  quick here
[4565.72 --> 4566.18]  and find
[4566.18 --> 4566.88]  out how
[4566.88 --> 4567.10]  many
[4567.10 --> 4567.88]  subscribers
[4567.88 --> 4569.24]  LTT
[4569.24 --> 4570.40]  has lost
[4570.40 --> 4571.18]  over the
[4571.18 --> 4571.58]  years
[4571.58 --> 4572.36]  so if you
[4572.36 --> 4572.58]  want to
[4572.58 --> 4573.18]  kind of talk
[4573.18 --> 4573.46]  through
[4573.46 --> 4573.88]  the next
[4573.88 --> 4574.06]  thing
[4574.06 --> 4575.20]  these numbers
[4575.20 --> 4575.22]  these numbers
[4575.22 --> 4575.24]  these numbers
[4575.24 --> 4576.34]  are huge
[4576.34 --> 4577.04]  but it's
[4577.04 --> 4577.32]  huge
[4577.32 --> 4577.68]  because
[4577.68 --> 4578.56]  it's
[4578.56 --> 4578.74]  never
[4578.74 --> 4578.94]  been
[4578.94 --> 4579.22]  done
[4579.22 --> 4579.52]  before
[4579.52 --> 4579.90]  on that
[4579.90 --> 4580.42]  platform
[4580.42 --> 4581.40]  but yeah
[4581.40 --> 4581.68]  let me
[4581.68 --> 4582.24]  let me find
[4582.24 --> 4582.80]  a new
[4582.80 --> 4584.08]  topic
[4584.08 --> 4584.38]  here
[4584.38 --> 4584.88]  really quick
[4584.88 --> 4585.66]  and I
[4585.66 --> 4586.28]  hate
[4586.28 --> 4587.48]  the new
[4587.48 --> 4588.04]  dashboard
[4588.04 --> 4588.40]  it's not
[4588.40 --> 4588.80]  even new
[4588.80 --> 4589.24]  anymore
[4589.24 --> 4589.86]  it's just
[4589.86 --> 4590.88]  everything
[4590.88 --> 4592.12]  is so
[4592.12 --> 4592.78]  much
[4592.78 --> 4593.20]  harder
[4593.20 --> 4593.80]  to find
[4593.80 --> 4594.20]  just
[4594.20 --> 4595.22]  basic
[4595.22 --> 4595.98]  stupid
[4595.98 --> 4596.44]  crap
[4596.44 --> 4597.36]  it's like
[4597.36 --> 4599.98]  so frustrating
[4599.98 --> 4601.10]  where do I
[4601.10 --> 4601.78]  just see
[4601.78 --> 4602.92]  the subscription
[4602.92 --> 4603.74]  rate of the
[4603.74 --> 4604.06]  channel
[4604.06 --> 4604.94]  okay
[4604.94 --> 4605.54]  so here's
[4605.54 --> 4605.96]  this
[4605.96 --> 4606.34]  yeah
[4606.34 --> 4606.94]  we got
[4606.94 --> 4607.34]  that
[4607.34 --> 4608.00]  so what
[4608.00 --> 4608.32]  it's under
[4608.32 --> 4608.90]  video
[4608.90 --> 4609.86]  subscribers
[4609.86 --> 4610.74]  by video
[4610.74 --> 4611.14]  no
[4611.14 --> 4611.60]  I just
[4611.60 --> 4611.90]  want
[4611.90 --> 4612.74]  subscribers
[4612.74 --> 4613.88]  I do
[4613.88 --> 4614.30]  have a
[4614.30 --> 4614.72]  topic
[4614.72 --> 4615.20]  if we
[4615.20 --> 4615.64]  want to
[4615.64 --> 4615.92]  yeah
[4615.92 --> 4616.48]  go ahead
[4616.48 --> 4616.82]  I'm just
[4616.82 --> 4617.72]  I'll keep
[4617.72 --> 4618.18]  working on
[4618.18 --> 4618.50]  this
[4618.50 --> 4619.82]  Microsoft's
[4619.82 --> 4620.24]  acquisition
[4620.24 --> 4620.60]  streak
[4620.60 --> 4621.08]  continues
[4621.08 --> 4621.46]  we talked
[4621.46 --> 4621.90]  about this
[4621.90 --> 4622.96]  in the
[4622.96 --> 4623.50]  intro
[4623.50 --> 4623.82]  of the
[4623.82 --> 4624.06]  video
[4624.06 --> 4624.38]  but
[4624.38 --> 4624.94]  they're
[4624.94 --> 4625.32]  buying
[4625.32 --> 4625.74]  another
[4625.74 --> 4626.20]  company
[4626.20 --> 4627.08]  this
[4627.08 --> 4627.34]  time
[4627.34 --> 4627.50]  for
[4627.50 --> 4628.72]  19.7
[4628.72 --> 4629.56]  billion
[4629.56 --> 4630.10]  dollars
[4630.10 --> 4630.50]  it is
[4630.50 --> 4631.22]  Nuance
[4631.22 --> 4631.88]  and I
[4631.88 --> 4632.32]  didn't see
[4632.32 --> 4632.64]  this
[4632.64 --> 4633.16]  part
[4633.16 --> 4633.52]  coming
[4633.52 --> 4633.98]  but
[4633.98 --> 4634.70]  Nuance
[4634.70 --> 4635.08]  claims
[4635.08 --> 4635.30]  it is
[4635.30 --> 4635.50]  being
[4635.50 --> 4635.78]  used
[4635.78 --> 4636.18]  by more

[4638.06 --> 4638.76]  and
[4638.76 --> 4639.40]  75%

[4643.00 --> 4643.36]  US
[4643.36 --> 4644.22]  hospitals
[4644.22 --> 4645.12]  that
[4645.12 --> 4645.28]  is
[4645.28 --> 4645.72]  crazy
[4645.72 --> 4646.22]  market
[4646.22 --> 4646.56]  share
[4646.56 --> 4647.24]  very
[4647.24 --> 4647.88]  very
[4647.88 --> 4648.46]  surprising
[4648.46 --> 4648.90]  to me
[4648.90 --> 4649.94]  and it
[4649.94 --> 4650.22]  shows
[4650.22 --> 4650.60]  Microsoft
[4650.60 --> 4650.98]  getting

[4652.20 --> 4652.94]  sort
[4652.94 --> 4653.74]  of
[4653.74 --> 4654.86]  okay
[4654.86 --> 4655.94]  so
[4655.94 --> 4656.26]  Microsoft
[4656.26 --> 4656.52]  has
[4656.52 --> 4656.88]  acquired

[4671.22 --> 4671.62]  unclear

[4691.26 --> 4691.70]  confuses

[4717.40 --> 4717.84]  to you
[4717.84 --> 4718.30]  and then
[4718.30 --> 4719.32]  ride them
[4719.32 --> 4719.72]  into the

[4727.44 --> 4728.98]  I can
[4728.98 --> 4729.70]  see why
[4729.70 --> 4729.94]  they
[4729.94 --> 4730.96]  find
[4730.96 --> 4731.38]  nuance
[4731.38 --> 4731.92]  interesting
[4731.92 --> 4732.32]  I had
[4732.32 --> 4733.00]  no
[4733.00 --> 4733.68]  I would
[4733.68 --> 4734.22]  have never
[4734.22 --> 4734.70]  guessed
[4734.70 --> 4735.24]  it would
[4735.24 --> 4735.64]  have that

[4736.38 --> 4736.70]  share
[4736.70 --> 4737.98]  not a
[4737.98 --> 4738.30]  clue
[4738.30 --> 4738.72]  at all
[4738.72 --> 4738.96]  if you
[4738.96 --> 4739.24]  told me
[4739.24 --> 4739.64]  it was
[4739.64 --> 4740.24]  speak
[4740.24 --> 4740.70]  recognition
[4740.70 --> 4741.24]  and
[4741.24 --> 4741.94]  AI
[4741.94 --> 4742.80]  I wouldn't
[4742.80 --> 4743.12]  assume
[4743.12 --> 4743.52]  it was
[4743.52 --> 4744.60]  radiologists
[4744.60 --> 4746.06]  and 77%
[4746.06 --> 4746.52]  of all
[4746.52 --> 4747.26]  US hospitals
[4747.26 --> 4747.90]  I would
[4747.90 --> 4748.32]  not have
[4748.32 --> 4748.74]  put those
[4748.74 --> 4749.04]  together
[4749.04 --> 4749.30]  at all
[4749.30 --> 4749.80]  this was
[4749.80 --> 4750.22]  a multiple
[4750.22 --> 4750.56]  choice
[4750.56 --> 4750.94]  question
[4750.94 --> 4751.52]  I would
[4751.52 --> 4752.00]  have not
[4752.00 --> 4752.48]  been a
[4752.48 --> 4752.76]  verified
[4752.76 --> 4753.20]  actual
[4753.20 --> 4753.50]  gamer
[4753.50 --> 4754.82]  I just
[4754.82 --> 4755.18]  yeah
[4755.18 --> 4755.80]  I would
[4755.80 --> 4756.20]  not have
[4756.20 --> 4756.82]  gotten that
[4756.82 --> 4757.16]  at all
[4757.16 --> 4757.60]  okay
[4757.60 --> 4758.32]  I'm ready
[4758.32 --> 4759.12]  okay
[4759.12 --> 4759.48]  I want
[4759.48 --> 4759.80]  to hear
[4759.80 --> 4760.20]  I want
[4760.20 --> 4760.44]  to hear
[4760.44 --> 4760.96]  your guess
[4760.96 --> 4762.16]  for how
[4762.16 --> 4762.42]  many
[4762.42 --> 4763.14]  subscribers
[4763.14 --> 4763.90]  Linus
[4763.90 --> 4764.50]  Tech Tips
[4764.50 --> 4765.32]  has lost
[4765.32 --> 4765.72]  in its

[4768.32 --> 4768.76]  nearly
[4768.76 --> 4769.28]  history
[4769.28 --> 4771.28]  lost
[4771.28 --> 4772.52]  4 million
[4772.52 --> 4773.40]  where'd you
[4773.40 --> 4773.70]  get that
[4773.70 --> 4774.90]  number from
[4774.90 --> 4779.04]  space
[4779.04 --> 4780.04]  space
[4780.04 --> 4780.84]  all right
[4780.84 --> 4781.26]  well you're
[4781.26 --> 4781.64]  you're a
[4781.64 --> 4782.14]  little far
[4782.14 --> 4782.94]  out to
[4782.94 --> 4783.58]  the past
[4783.58 --> 4783.96]  the moon
[4783.96 --> 4784.86]  here a
[4784.86 --> 4785.36]  little bit
[4785.36 --> 4786.48]  all right
[4786.48 --> 4786.92]  but you're
[4786.92 --> 4788.02]  not that
[4788.02 --> 4788.54]  far off
[4788.54 --> 4790.40]  so the
[4790.40 --> 4791.06]  real number
[4791.06 --> 4791.96]  is
[4791.96 --> 4792.94]  hold on a
[4792.94 --> 4793.28]  second let me
[4793.28 --> 4793.76]  just kind of
[4793.76 --> 4794.30]  fix this a
[4794.30 --> 4794.64]  bit here
[4794.64 --> 4794.98]  and make it
[4794.98 --> 4795.12]  a little
[4795.12 --> 4795.48]  smaller
[4795.48 --> 4796.20]  there we
[4796.20 --> 4796.36]  go
[4796.36 --> 4797.18]  there's my
[4797.18 --> 4797.66]  dashboard
[4797.66 --> 4798.54]  the real
[4798.54 --> 4799.36]  number is
[4799.36 --> 4800.98]  3.56
[4800.98 --> 4802.02]  million
[4802.02 --> 4802.98]  people
[4802.98 --> 4803.74]  have
[4803.74 --> 4805.80]  unsubscribed
[4805.80 --> 4806.58]  from Linus
[4806.58 --> 4807.08]  Tech Tips
[4807.08 --> 4807.96]  now
[4807.96 --> 4809.30]  yeah go ahead
[4809.30 --> 4810.34]  that's not
[4810.34 --> 4810.92]  really accurate
[4810.92 --> 4812.26]  no it's not
[4812.26 --> 4813.40]  because you can
[4813.40 --> 4814.20]  actually see
[4814.20 --> 4814.96]  some of the
[4814.96 --> 4816.02]  videos that have
[4816.02 --> 4816.46]  caused
[4816.46 --> 4817.42]  unsubscription
[4817.42 --> 4818.00]  spikes
[4818.00 --> 4819.40]  are the
[4819.40 --> 4820.30]  gold play button
[4820.30 --> 4820.82]  unboxing
[4820.82 --> 4822.34]  the I've
[4822.34 --> 4822.74]  been thinking
[4822.74 --> 4823.56]  of retiring
[4823.56 --> 4824.52]  stream and
[4824.52 --> 4824.96]  is there
[4824.96 --> 4825.82]  anything you
[4825.82 --> 4826.32]  can think
[4826.32 --> 4826.80]  of that
[4826.80 --> 4827.74]  those two
[4827.74 --> 4828.34]  videos have
[4828.34 --> 4828.78]  in common
[4828.78 --> 4834.50]  they're not
[4834.50 --> 4835.20]  not tech
[4835.20 --> 4835.56]  related
[4835.56 --> 4837.34]  that's a good
[4837.34 --> 4837.58]  try
[4837.58 --> 4839.38]  they are
[4839.38 --> 4840.08]  huge
[4840.08 --> 4840.64]  they are
[4840.64 --> 4841.32]  subscriber
[4841.32 --> 4841.92]  milestones
[4841.92 --> 4843.34]  so one of
[4843.34 --> 4843.54]  them is
[4843.54 --> 4844.04]  1 million
[4844.04 --> 4844.48]  one of
[4844.48 --> 4844.72]  them is
[4844.72 --> 4845.24]  10 million
[4845.24 --> 4846.12]  I didn't
[4846.12 --> 4846.46]  know the
[4846.46 --> 4846.98]  retire one
[4846.98 --> 4847.66]  was a
[4847.66 --> 4847.94]  milestone
[4847.94 --> 4848.26]  okay
[4848.26 --> 4848.74]  it was
[4848.74 --> 4848.96]  it was
[4848.96 --> 4849.24]  the 10
[4849.24 --> 4849.58]  million
[4849.58 --> 4850.32]  subscriber
[4850.32 --> 4851.00]  milestone
[4851.00 --> 4851.60]  stream
[4851.60 --> 4852.68]  and the
[4852.68 --> 4853.32]  reason that
[4853.32 --> 4853.56]  people
[4853.56 --> 4854.42]  unsubscribe
[4854.42 --> 4855.16]  from those
[4855.16 --> 4855.92]  videos is
[4855.92 --> 4856.74]  because it's
[4856.74 --> 4857.32]  easier to
[4857.32 --> 4857.90]  check how
[4857.90 --> 4858.62]  many subscribers
[4858.62 --> 4859.08]  a channel
[4859.08 --> 4860.14]  has if you
[4860.14 --> 4860.52]  are not
[4860.52 --> 4861.30]  subscribed to
[4861.30 --> 4861.48]  it
[4861.48 --> 4862.76]  oh that
[4862.76 --> 4863.54]  makes sense
[4863.54 --> 4864.64]  so people
[4864.64 --> 4865.82]  will unsubscribe
[4865.82 --> 4866.64]  and then
[4866.64 --> 4867.42]  resubscribe
[4867.42 --> 4868.20]  immediately
[4868.20 --> 4868.98]  so you can
[4868.98 --> 4869.44]  see they
[4869.44 --> 4870.02]  also
[4870.02 --> 4871.36]  here we can
[4871.36 --> 4872.14]  actually show
[4872.14 --> 4872.82]  subscribers
[4872.82 --> 4873.62]  gained
[4873.62 --> 4874.36]  here we go
[4874.36 --> 4874.70]  let's just
[4874.70 --> 4875.20]  add a quick
[4875.20 --> 4875.76]  column here
[4875.76 --> 4876.70]  I hate
[4876.70 --> 4877.64]  this dashboard
[4877.64 --> 4878.62]  so much
[4878.62 --> 4880.04]  they claim
[4880.04 --> 4880.74]  they built
[4880.74 --> 4881.06]  the new
[4881.06 --> 4881.70]  one to
[4881.70 --> 4882.32]  be faster
[4882.32 --> 4883.42]  well
[4883.42 --> 4884.86]  they done
[4884.86 --> 4886.12]  up then
[4886.12 --> 4886.76]  didn't they
[4886.76 --> 4887.86]  because it's
[4887.86 --> 4888.40]  not
[4888.40 --> 4889.68]  I hate
[4889.68 --> 4890.24]  it so
[4890.24 --> 4890.80]  much
[4890.80 --> 4891.64]  you already
[4891.64 --> 4892.76]  you already
[4892.76 --> 4893.48]  fetched this
[4893.48 --> 4893.72]  data
[4893.72 --> 4894.64]  you already
[4894.64 --> 4895.36]  fetched it
[4895.36 --> 4896.52]  just rearrange
[4896.52 --> 4897.04]  it
[4897.04 --> 4897.86]  okay
[4897.86 --> 4898.40]  anyway
[4898.40 --> 4899.54]  so you can
[4899.54 --> 4900.10]  see both
[4900.10 --> 4900.40]  of those
[4900.40 --> 4900.88]  videos
[4900.88 --> 4902.38]  had enormous
[4902.38 --> 4903.42]  net gains
[4903.42 --> 4904.08]  of subscribers
[4904.08 --> 4904.46]  so it's
[4904.46 --> 4905.04]  not like
[4905.04 --> 4905.88]  it's not
[4905.88 --> 4906.30]  like they
[4906.30 --> 4906.94]  they made
[4906.94 --> 4907.60]  the community
[4907.60 --> 4909.04]  super mad
[4909.04 --> 4909.98]  they just
[4909.98 --> 4911.66]  had a ton
[4911.66 --> 4912.42]  of interaction
[4912.42 --> 4913.30]  or people
[4913.30 --> 4913.78]  were checking
[4913.78 --> 4915.02]  specifically on
[4915.02 --> 4915.44]  that button
[4915.44 --> 4915.78]  because they're
[4915.78 --> 4916.12]  checking
[4916.12 --> 4916.48]  yeah
[4916.48 --> 4916.82]  yeah
[4916.82 --> 4917.78]  one thing
[4917.78 --> 4918.10]  I just want
[4918.10 --> 4918.36]  to jump
[4918.36 --> 4918.96]  back to the
[4918.96 --> 4920.18]  the Microsoft
[4920.18 --> 4921.16]  acquiring nuance
[4921.16 --> 4922.22]  thing
[4922.22 --> 4923.28]  it was pointed
[4923.28 --> 4923.70]  out that
[4923.70 --> 4924.50]  dragon naturally
[4924.50 --> 4925.52]  speaking is one
[4925.52 --> 4925.76]  of their
[4925.76 --> 4926.22]  products
[4926.22 --> 4928.24]  and someone
[4928.24 --> 4928.94]  in floatplane
[4928.94 --> 4930.00]  chat actually
[4930.00 --> 4930.50]  mentioned
[4930.50 --> 4932.50]  that in
[4932.50 --> 4932.92]  healthcare
[4932.92 --> 4933.44]  IT
[4933.44 --> 4934.36]  they often
[4934.36 --> 4934.72]  use
[4934.72 --> 4935.34]  nuance
[4935.34 --> 4935.92]  dragon
[4935.92 --> 4936.68]  dictation
[4936.68 --> 4937.32]  which is
[4937.32 --> 4937.76]  I'm assuming
[4937.76 --> 4938.42]  the newer
[4938.42 --> 4938.94]  or maybe
[4938.94 --> 4939.32]  corporate
[4939.32 --> 4939.74]  focused
[4939.74 --> 4939.98]  one
[4939.98 --> 4940.80]  because
[4940.80 --> 4941.30]  doctors
[4941.30 --> 4942.26]  can't
[4942.26 --> 4942.62]  type
[4942.62 --> 4943.30]  when they're
[4943.30 --> 4943.78]  doing stuff
[4943.78 --> 4944.52]  so it's
[4944.52 --> 4945.00]  easier to
[4945.00 --> 4945.38]  talk into
[4945.38 --> 4945.80]  a mic
[4945.80 --> 4946.84]  to actively
[4946.84 --> 4947.56]  take notes
[4947.56 --> 4948.44]  wow
[4948.44 --> 4949.80]  totally makes
[4949.80 --> 4950.16]  sense
[4950.16 --> 4951.00]  all right
[4951.00 --> 4951.72]  and they can
[4951.72 --> 4952.52]  afford to pay
[4952.52 --> 4953.14]  for expensive
[4953.14 --> 4954.28]  voice to text
[4954.28 --> 4954.96]  software I guess
[4954.96 --> 4956.28]  especially with
[4956.28 --> 4956.94]  American hospital
[4956.94 --> 4957.24]  bills
[4957.24 --> 4957.62]  yeah
[4957.62 --> 4958.30]  but they don't
[4958.30 --> 4959.26]  have a phone
[4959.26 --> 4960.60]  to do that
[4960.60 --> 4960.82]  with
[4960.82 --> 4961.94]  that would be
[4961.94 --> 4962.52]  that would be
[4962.52 --> 4963.10]  too difficult
[4963.10 --> 4963.76]  okay
[4963.76 --> 4964.72]  hey that's good
[4964.72 --> 4964.98]  to know
[4964.98 --> 4965.48]  oh it's probably
[4965.48 --> 4966.02]  it's probably
[4966.02 --> 4966.34]  better
[4966.34 --> 4967.34]  and especially
[4967.34 --> 4967.94]  if they have
[4967.94 --> 4968.60]  this enormous
[4968.60 --> 4969.20]  market share
[4969.20 --> 4969.60]  in the medical
[4969.60 --> 4969.94]  space
[4969.94 --> 4970.42]  they probably
[4970.42 --> 4971.08]  tune it
[4971.08 --> 4971.86]  to actually
[4971.86 --> 4972.52]  recognize
[4972.52 --> 4973.24]  medical terms
[4973.24 --> 4973.58]  and stuff
[4973.58 --> 4973.86]  like that
[4973.86 --> 4974.10]  wouldn't be
[4974.10 --> 4974.48]  surprised
[4974.48 --> 4974.76]  yeah
[4974.76 --> 4975.40]  makes sense
[4975.40 --> 4977.52]  all right
[4977.52 --> 4980.18]  someone else
[4980.18 --> 4980.76]  says dragon
[4980.76 --> 4981.42]  is used by
[4981.42 --> 4982.38]  AHS
[4982.38 --> 4982.90]  Alberta
[4982.90 --> 4983.30]  Health
[4983.30 --> 4983.66]  Services
[4983.66 --> 4984.12]  I'm assuming
[4984.12 --> 4984.54]  that sounds
[4984.54 --> 4984.70]  true
[4984.70 --> 4986.24]  but my wife
[4986.24 --> 4986.68]  says it's
[4986.68 --> 4987.80]  pretty garbage
[4987.80 --> 4988.82]  all right
[4988.82 --> 4990.18]  who knows
[4990.18 --> 4991.56]  Zet487
[4991.56 --> 4992.16]  says I
[4992.16 --> 4992.70]  unsubscribed
[4992.70 --> 4993.18]  once because
[4993.18 --> 4993.68]  I got tired
[4993.68 --> 4994.24]  of the clickbait
[4994.24 --> 4994.96]  titles after
[4994.96 --> 4995.52]  he said that
[4995.52 --> 4995.84]  he wasn't
[4995.84 --> 4996.16]  going to do
[4996.16 --> 4996.84]  them but
[4996.84 --> 4997.18]  here I am
[4997.18 --> 4997.46]  again
[4997.46 --> 4998.86]  yeah
[4998.86 --> 4999.68]  sorry
[4999.68 --> 5000.78]  I don't
[5000.78 --> 5001.04]  make the
[5001.04 --> 5001.34]  rules
[5001.34 --> 5002.20]  dragon
[5002.20 --> 5002.74]  processes
[5002.74 --> 5003.28]  locally
[5003.28 --> 5003.64]  doesn't
[5003.64 --> 5004.22]  it
[5004.22 --> 5004.42]  yeah
[5004.42 --> 5004.68]  I believe
[5004.68 --> 5004.90]  so
[5004.90 --> 5006.08]  that's
[5006.08 --> 5006.30]  probably
[5006.30 --> 5006.56]  why
[5006.56 --> 5006.94]  oh yeah
[5006.94 --> 5007.08]  that's
[5007.08 --> 5007.24]  probably
[5007.24 --> 5007.40]  why
[5007.40 --> 5007.52]  it
[5007.52 --> 5007.76]  sucks
[5007.76 --> 5008.06]  and
[5008.06 --> 5008.24]  that's
[5008.24 --> 5008.44]  probably
[5008.44 --> 5008.60]  why
[5008.60 --> 5008.70]  they
[5008.70 --> 5008.80]  have
[5008.80 --> 5008.88]  to
[5008.88 --> 5009.02]  use
[5009.02 --> 5009.24]  it
[5009.24 --> 5009.96]  yep
[5009.96 --> 5010.42]  that makes
[5010.42 --> 5010.74]  sense
[5010.74 --> 5011.40]  yeah
[5011.40 --> 5011.78]  yep
[5011.78 --> 5013.54]  yeah
[5013.54 --> 5013.98]  you know
[5013.98 --> 5014.30]  I mean
[5014.30 --> 5014.68]  I could
[5014.68 --> 5015.02]  I could
[5015.02 --> 5015.40]  address
[5015.40 --> 5015.96]  why we
[5015.96 --> 5016.52]  title things
[5016.52 --> 5016.76]  the way
[5016.76 --> 5017.02]  we do
[5017.02 --> 5017.34]  again
[5017.34 --> 5017.94]  but honestly
[5017.94 --> 5018.44]  the answers
[5018.44 --> 5018.88]  just keep
[5018.88 --> 5019.46]  not changing
[5019.46 --> 5020.22]  we're making
[5020.22 --> 5020.86]  it part of
[5020.86 --> 5021.30]  I think it's
[5021.30 --> 5021.64]  going to be a
[5021.64 --> 5022.28]  monthly task
[5022.28 --> 5022.76]  for the writers
[5022.76 --> 5023.34]  to go back
[5023.34 --> 5023.62]  to their
[5023.62 --> 5024.36]  previous videos
[5024.36 --> 5024.82]  and make sure
[5024.82 --> 5025.36]  they're adding
[5025.36 --> 5026.56]  the descriptive
[5026.56 --> 5027.36]  titles to the
[5027.36 --> 5027.98]  end like we
[5027.98 --> 5028.40]  said we were
[5028.40 --> 5028.86]  going to
[5028.86 --> 5029.30]  because we got
[5029.30 --> 5029.90]  lazy about it
[5029.90 --> 5030.42]  for a while
[5030.42 --> 5031.32]  but
[5031.32 --> 5032.92]  I
[5032.92 --> 5034.22]  I just
[5034.22 --> 5034.70]  I'm not
[5034.70 --> 5035.20]  I'm not
[5035.20 --> 5035.44]  going to
[5035.44 --> 5035.70]  promise
[5035.70 --> 5036.06]  that we're
[5036.06 --> 5036.24]  going to
[5036.24 --> 5036.56]  change
[5036.56 --> 5036.86]  the way
[5036.86 --> 5037.06]  that we
[5037.06 --> 5037.28]  title
[5037.28 --> 5037.68]  videos
[5037.68 --> 5038.08]  I'm sorry
[5038.08 --> 5038.36]  I wish
[5038.36 --> 5038.64]  it didn't
[5038.64 --> 5038.88]  work
[5038.88 --> 5039.16]  but it
[5039.16 --> 5039.56]  does
[5039.56 --> 5043.54]  and I
[5043.54 --> 5043.96]  think that's
[5043.96 --> 5044.74]  oh
[5044.74 --> 5045.22]  go ahead
[5045.22 --> 5046.10]  people are
[5046.10 --> 5046.54]  asking for
[5046.54 --> 5047.26]  an OnlyFans
[5047.26 --> 5047.68]  update
[5047.68 --> 5049.10]  the OnlyFans
[5049.10 --> 5049.52]  update
[5049.52 --> 5050.20]  is going
[5050.20 --> 5050.78]  to come
[5050.78 --> 5051.42]  in
[5051.42 --> 5059.28]  on Monday
[5059.28 --> 5060.02]  on Floatplane
[5060.02 --> 5060.86]  and Tuesday
[5060.86 --> 5061.68]  on YouTube
[5061.68 --> 5064.00]  okay
[5064.00 --> 5064.36]  yeah
[5064.36 --> 5065.08]  so it'll
[5065.08 --> 5065.50]  it'll be
[5065.50 --> 5065.88]  there
[5065.88 --> 5066.68]  I'm not
[5066.68 --> 5067.08]  going to
[5067.08 --> 5067.90]  spoil anything
[5067.90 --> 5069.18]  but we
[5069.18 --> 5070.20]  we will be
[5070.20 --> 5070.78]  addressing
[5070.78 --> 5072.28]  what we're
[5072.28 --> 5072.58]  doing with
[5072.58 --> 5073.34]  the OnlyFans
[5073.34 --> 5074.06]  and we will
[5074.06 --> 5074.58]  be addressing
[5074.58 --> 5075.18]  what we're
[5075.18 --> 5076.02]  doing with
[5076.02 --> 5076.88]  Lewis Rossman's
[5076.88 --> 5077.16]  right to
[5077.16 --> 5077.52]  repair
[5077.52 --> 5078.68]  push
[5078.68 --> 5079.28]  right now
[5079.28 --> 5079.90]  at the same
[5079.90 --> 5080.26]  time
[5080.26 --> 5081.06]  how those
[5081.06 --> 5081.44]  things are
[5081.44 --> 5081.82]  related
[5081.82 --> 5082.80]  man
[5082.80 --> 5083.82]  bringing up
[5083.82 --> 5084.74]  hard details
[5084.74 --> 5085.70]  clearly a
[5085.70 --> 5086.10]  complicated
[5086.10 --> 5086.80]  story
[5086.80 --> 5088.80]  clearly
[5088.80 --> 5090.20]  you had
[5090.20 --> 5090.48]  to be
[5090.48 --> 5090.72]  there
[5090.72 --> 5091.18]  moment
[5091.18 --> 5091.94]  yeah
[5091.94 --> 5092.36]  yeah
[5092.36 --> 5092.98]  yeah
[5092.98 --> 5096.38]  all right
[5096.38 --> 5097.84]  I've got
[5097.84 --> 5098.14]  a few
[5098.14 --> 5098.70]  super chats
[5098.70 --> 5099.04]  to go
[5099.04 --> 5099.24]  through
[5099.24 --> 5099.74]  real quick
[5099.74 --> 5100.02]  for you
[5100.02 --> 5100.36]  guys
[5100.36 --> 5101.12]  Rauertek
[5101.12 --> 5101.40]  asks
[5101.40 --> 5101.58]  hey
[5101.58 --> 5101.78]  how's
[5101.78 --> 5102.00]  everything
[5102.00 --> 5102.26]  going
[5102.26 --> 5102.48]  over
[5102.48 --> 5102.62]  at
[5102.62 --> 5103.00]  Floatplane
[5103.00 --> 5104.86]  any plans
[5104.86 --> 5105.12]  for some
[5105.12 --> 5105.50]  behind the
[5105.50 --> 5105.70]  scenes
[5105.70 --> 5106.06]  Luke is
[5106.06 --> 5106.36]  supposed
[5106.36 --> 5106.70]  to have
[5106.70 --> 5107.08]  a blog
[5107.08 --> 5107.66]  but he
[5107.66 --> 5107.88]  doesn't
[5107.88 --> 5108.20]  post to
[5108.20 --> 5108.40]  it
[5108.40 --> 5110.42]  don't
[5110.42 --> 5110.64]  like
[5110.64 --> 5110.86]  it
[5110.86 --> 5111.86]  how's
[5111.86 --> 5112.14]  it going
[5112.14 --> 5113.34]  oh
[5113.34 --> 5113.54]  it's
[5113.54 --> 5113.72]  going
[5113.72 --> 5114.02]  okay
[5114.02 --> 5114.40]  yeah
[5114.40 --> 5115.12]  there's
[5115.12 --> 5115.28]  a new
[5115.28 --> 5115.74]  front page
[5115.74 --> 5116.08]  check it
[5116.08 --> 5116.24]  out
[5116.24 --> 5116.56]  it's all
[5116.56 --> 5116.84]  cool
[5116.84 --> 5117.68]  looks
[5117.68 --> 5118.84]  maybe a
[5118.84 --> 5119.26]  little bit
[5119.26 --> 5121.54]  more standard
[5121.54 --> 5122.06]  than our
[5122.06 --> 5122.58]  previous one
[5122.58 --> 5122.86]  but I think
[5122.86 --> 5123.40]  it's cleaner
[5123.40 --> 5124.72]  we might be
[5124.72 --> 5125.12]  changing
[5125.12 --> 5126.24]  some of the
[5126.24 --> 5126.60]  text
[5126.60 --> 5127.12]  the images
[5127.12 --> 5127.52]  might get
[5127.52 --> 5127.86]  updated
[5127.86 --> 5128.24]  we might
[5128.24 --> 5128.72]  replace
[5128.72 --> 5129.66]  Linus
[5129.66 --> 5130.96]  pointing hands
[5130.96 --> 5132.18]  with like a
[5132.18 --> 5132.66]  video or
[5132.66 --> 5133.08]  something like
[5133.08 --> 5133.46]  that but
[5133.46 --> 5133.76]  this is
[5133.76 --> 5134.74]  generally
[5134.74 --> 5135.70]  the new
[5135.70 --> 5136.42]  design direction
[5136.42 --> 5136.78]  that it's
[5136.78 --> 5137.04]  going to
[5137.04 --> 5137.24]  have
[5137.24 --> 5138.20]  you can
[5138.20 --> 5138.84]  find it
[5138.84 --> 5139.38]  by going
[5139.38 --> 5139.46]  to
[5139.46 --> 5140.08]  flowplane.com
[5140.08 --> 5140.72]  discover
[5140.72 --> 5141.82]  if you're
[5141.82 --> 5142.22]  logged in
[5142.22 --> 5142.48]  you won't
[5142.48 --> 5142.90]  automatically
[5142.90 --> 5143.30]  go to that
[5143.30 --> 5143.82]  page just
[5143.82 --> 5144.18]  because you're
[5144.18 --> 5144.44]  wondering
[5144.44 --> 5146.06]  and this
[5146.06 --> 5146.88]  is kind
[5146.88 --> 5147.14]  of
[5147.14 --> 5148.00]  ushering
[5148.00 --> 5148.44]  in
[5148.44 --> 5149.60]  Jaden
[5149.60 --> 5149.84]  one of the
[5149.84 --> 5150.08]  guys on
[5150.08 --> 5150.32]  the team
[5150.32 --> 5150.54]  has been
[5150.54 --> 5151.20]  doing a ton
[5151.20 --> 5151.64]  of work
[5151.64 --> 5151.96]  on the
[5151.96 --> 5152.36]  front end
[5152.36 --> 5153.74]  doing stuff
[5153.74 --> 5154.02]  that is
[5154.02 --> 5154.56]  maybe not
[5154.56 --> 5154.92]  super
[5154.92 --> 5155.30]  noticeable
[5155.30 --> 5156.00]  to users
[5156.00 --> 5156.70]  yet
[5156.70 --> 5157.70]  but there
[5157.70 --> 5158.00]  will be
[5158.00 --> 5158.26]  a bit
[5158.26 --> 5158.56]  of a
[5158.56 --> 5158.92]  visual
[5158.92 --> 5159.60]  revamp
[5159.60 --> 5160.12]  to
[5160.12 --> 5160.82]  like
[5160.82 --> 5161.12]  the
[5161.12 --> 5161.40]  website
[5161.40 --> 5162.12]  as a
[5162.12 --> 5162.42]  whole
[5162.42 --> 5163.12]  and this
[5163.12 --> 5163.60]  front page
[5163.60 --> 5164.28]  is the
[5164.28 --> 5164.58]  beginning
[5164.58 --> 5165.16]  so
[5165.16 --> 5165.90]  more to
[5165.90 --> 5166.06]  come
[5166.06 --> 5170.08]  chapsticks
[5170.08 --> 5170.44]  asks
[5170.44 --> 5170.80]  when will
[5170.80 --> 5171.08]  we need
[5171.08 --> 5171.46]  to see
[5171.46 --> 5171.84]  the next
[5171.84 --> 5172.50]  scrapyard
[5172.50 --> 5172.80]  wars
[5172.80 --> 5173.74]  I don't
[5173.74 --> 5174.08]  know how
[5174.08 --> 5174.40]  we would
[5174.40 --> 5174.76]  ever do
[5174.76 --> 5175.28]  a scrapyard
[5175.28 --> 5175.56]  wars
[5175.56 --> 5175.82]  again
[5175.82 --> 5176.18]  honestly
[5176.18 --> 5176.78]  at this
[5176.78 --> 5177.08]  point
[5177.08 --> 5178.00]  literally
[5178.00 --> 5178.84]  everyone
[5178.84 --> 5179.52]  at Linus
[5179.52 --> 5180.18]  media group
[5180.18 --> 5181.64]  is too
[5181.64 --> 5182.26]  famous
[5182.26 --> 5182.78]  to
[5182.78 --> 5183.60]  or maybe
[5183.60 --> 5184.10]  not famous
[5184.10 --> 5184.56]  but at least
[5184.56 --> 5185.26]  recognizable
[5185.26 --> 5185.82]  within the
[5185.82 --> 5186.40]  tech community
[5186.40 --> 5188.14]  to possibly
[5188.14 --> 5189.60]  go incognito
[5189.60 --> 5191.00]  for long
[5191.00 --> 5191.30]  enough
[5191.30 --> 5192.30]  and authentically
[5192.30 --> 5192.72]  enough
[5192.72 --> 5193.52]  to shoot
[5193.52 --> 5194.64]  scrapyard
[5194.64 --> 5194.92]  wars
[5194.92 --> 5195.48]  the used
[5195.48 --> 5195.74]  market
[5195.74 --> 5196.16]  is also
[5196.16 --> 5196.66]  garbage
[5196.66 --> 5197.16]  right now
[5197.16 --> 5197.92]  yeah
[5197.92 --> 5198.30]  that doesn't
[5198.30 --> 5198.50]  help
[5198.50 --> 5198.88]  like I
[5198.88 --> 5199.20]  don't
[5199.20 --> 5199.40]  think
[5199.40 --> 5199.64]  it would
[5199.64 --> 5200.32]  be
[5200.32 --> 5202.34]  oh okay
[5202.34 --> 5202.70]  your
[5202.70 --> 5203.32]  graphics card
[5203.32 --> 5204.48]  is really
[5204.48 --> 5205.04]  annoying to
[5205.04 --> 5205.30]  purchase
[5205.30 --> 5206.82]  and absurdly
[5206.82 --> 5207.38]  expensive
[5207.38 --> 5210.16]  cool season
[5210.16 --> 5210.68]  bro
[5210.68 --> 5212.24]  someone pointed
[5212.24 --> 5212.86]  out that there
[5212.86 --> 5213.16]  was a
[5213.16 --> 5213.50]  scrapyard
[5213.50 --> 5214.04]  war season
[5214.04 --> 5214.72]  from like
[5214.72 --> 5215.58]  years ago
[5215.58 --> 5216.44]  where we
[5216.44 --> 5216.80]  bought
[5216.80 --> 5217.00]  I don't
[5217.00 --> 5217.30]  remember which
[5217.30 --> 5217.66]  one of us
[5217.66 --> 5218.10]  it was
[5218.10 --> 5218.70]  but one
[5218.70 --> 5218.96]  of us
[5218.96 --> 5219.42]  bought a
[5219.42 --> 5220.12]  graphics card
[5220.12 --> 5221.44]  that currently
[5221.44 --> 5222.18]  on craigslist
[5222.18 --> 5222.64]  is going for
[5222.64 --> 5223.10]  like almost
[5223.10 --> 5223.86]  twice the price
[5223.86 --> 5224.82]  I was just
[5224.82 --> 5226.16]  like yikes
[5226.16 --> 5227.12]  yeah it's
[5227.12 --> 5227.68]  pretty brutal
[5227.68 --> 5228.84]  and I'm
[5228.84 --> 5229.30]  starting to
[5229.30 --> 5229.76]  lose hope
[5229.76 --> 5230.12]  that there's
[5230.12 --> 5230.40]  going to be
[5230.40 --> 5231.00]  a big crypto
[5231.00 --> 5231.66]  crash anytime
[5231.66 --> 5232.44]  soon because
[5232.44 --> 5233.30]  the news for
[5233.30 --> 5233.86]  the crypto
[5233.86 --> 5234.84]  enthusiasts is
[5234.84 --> 5236.60]  definitely one
[5236.60 --> 5237.10]  good thing
[5237.10 --> 5237.80]  after another
[5237.80 --> 5238.70]  whether it's
[5238.70 --> 5239.26]  the coinbase
[5239.26 --> 5240.30]  IPO or
[5240.30 --> 5241.10]  buying teslas
[5241.10 --> 5241.96]  in crypto or
[5241.96 --> 5242.48]  whatever the
[5242.48 --> 5243.60]  case may be
[5243.60 --> 5244.74]  Nathan asks
[5244.74 --> 5245.10]  have you ever
[5245.10 --> 5245.62]  considered doing
[5245.62 --> 5246.10]  a channel that
[5246.10 --> 5246.58]  could be a lot
[5246.58 --> 5247.08]  more in-depth
[5247.08 --> 5247.50]  and feature
[5247.50 --> 5248.46]  instructable videos
[5248.46 --> 5249.12]  called Linus
[5249.12 --> 5249.94]  tech school or
[5249.94 --> 5250.30]  something
[5250.30 --> 5251.54]  yeah we've
[5251.54 --> 5252.08]  considered it
[5252.08 --> 5252.72]  the problem is
[5252.72 --> 5253.46]  that that kind
[5253.46 --> 5254.22]  of content is
[5254.22 --> 5255.24]  so specific
[5255.24 --> 5256.18]  and so
[5256.18 --> 5256.80]  specifically
[5256.80 --> 5257.60]  addresses the
[5257.60 --> 5258.54]  exact users
[5258.54 --> 5259.06]  who have that
[5259.06 --> 5259.92]  exact problem
[5259.92 --> 5260.68]  that it's really
[5260.68 --> 5261.46]  hard to achieve
[5261.46 --> 5261.96]  any kind of
[5261.96 --> 5263.62]  scale and for
[5263.62 --> 5264.54]  our business for
[5264.54 --> 5265.30]  something to make
[5265.30 --> 5266.38]  a dent and even
[5266.38 --> 5267.50]  be worth spending
[5267.50 --> 5268.44]  our time and
[5268.44 --> 5268.88]  devoting our
[5268.88 --> 5269.60]  attention to it
[5269.60 --> 5270.98]  it has to have
[5270.98 --> 5272.44]  some kind of
[5272.44 --> 5273.16]  potential for
[5273.16 --> 5274.30]  scalability and
[5274.30 --> 5275.18]  so that I think
[5275.18 --> 5275.72]  is the kind of
[5275.72 --> 5276.12]  thing that we're
[5276.12 --> 5276.50]  just going to
[5276.50 --> 5277.46]  leave to the
[5277.46 --> 5278.30]  people who
[5278.30 --> 5280.46]  a aren't chasing
[5280.46 --> 5280.98]  that kind of
[5280.98 --> 5281.64]  scale don't have
[5281.64 --> 5282.60]  50 employees and
[5282.60 --> 5283.14]  don't need every
[5283.14 --> 5283.74]  video to get a
[5283.74 --> 5284.38]  million views or
[5284.38 --> 5285.40]  whatever and
[5285.40 --> 5287.92]  B are more
[5287.92 --> 5289.46]  enthused about
[5289.46 --> 5290.14]  what they're
[5290.14 --> 5290.68]  doing like
[5290.68 --> 5291.26]  honestly we
[5291.26 --> 5291.70]  don't have
[5291.70 --> 5292.88]  anyone who's
[5292.88 --> 5294.58]  that dialed
[5294.58 --> 5295.78]  into game
[5295.78 --> 5296.42]  console repair
[5296.42 --> 5296.84]  for example
[5296.84 --> 5297.36]  there's a game
[5297.36 --> 5297.96]  console repair
[5297.96 --> 5298.50]  channel that I
[5298.50 --> 5299.42]  just love it's
[5299.42 --> 5300.40]  just like hypnotic
[5300.40 --> 5301.98]  to watch this
[5301.98 --> 5303.42]  guy do but
[5303.42 --> 5304.36]  he's massively
[5304.36 --> 5305.42]  overworked
[5305.42 --> 5306.12]  sorry what's
[5306.12 --> 5307.58]  that you have a
[5307.58 --> 5308.22]  person who's into
[5308.22 --> 5309.22]  game console repair
[5309.22 --> 5310.16]  Anthony he's into
[5310.16 --> 5310.58]  it but he's not
[5310.58 --> 5311.30]  into it like that
[5311.30 --> 5312.72]  guy like it's
[5312.72 --> 5313.72]  different like he
[5313.72 --> 5314.76]  lives and breathes
[5314.76 --> 5315.96]  it he's like buying
[5315.96 --> 5317.12]  20 switches at a
[5317.12 --> 5318.50]  time and like going
[5318.50 --> 5319.50]  through and diagnosing
[5319.50 --> 5320.26]  them one after the
[5320.26 --> 5320.74]  other after the
[5320.74 --> 5321.30]  other has all this
[5321.30 --> 5322.26]  specialized equipment
[5322.26 --> 5323.34]  for like desoldering
[5323.34 --> 5324.20]  and resoldering and
[5324.20 --> 5325.38]  like knows everything
[5325.38 --> 5326.36]  about them like
[5326.36 --> 5327.92]  Anthony's super into
[5327.92 --> 5329.82]  it but he like has
[5329.82 --> 5331.02]  other stuff to do and
[5331.02 --> 5332.10]  so just leaving those
[5332.10 --> 5333.14]  spaces to the people
[5333.14 --> 5333.72]  who are really
[5333.72 --> 5334.48]  passionate about it
[5334.48 --> 5335.02]  and have the time
[5335.02 --> 5335.86]  for it makes way
[5335.86 --> 5336.64]  more sense to me
[5336.64 --> 5337.88]  one thing I want to
[5337.88 --> 5338.54]  address is there's
[5338.54 --> 5339.04]  been a ton of

[5353.12 --> 5353.90]  new designs for the
[5353.90 --> 5355.36]  website all have

[5362.98 --> 5363.50]  don't need super
[5363.50 --> 5364.30]  chats why not put

[5371.24 --> 5372.48]  stay tuned but
[5372.48 --> 5373.28]  super chats go
[5373.28 --> 5374.30]  straight into Linus
[5374.30 --> 5374.74]  media groups
[5374.74 --> 5375.76]  coffers whether I
[5375.76 --> 5376.50]  personally need them

[5380.88 --> 5381.38]  and all the things
[5381.38 --> 5381.96]  that we need as a
[5381.96 --> 5383.68]  company Nathan thanks
[5383.68 --> 5384.70]  Nathan Nathan says
[5384.70 --> 5385.68]  Steve I really don't
[5385.68 --> 5386.44]  know the context for
[5386.44 --> 5387.40]  that but yo you
[5387.40 --> 5389.98]  know Steve so
[5389.98 --> 5390.72]  that's happened a few
[5390.72 --> 5391.42]  times recently I
[5391.42 --> 5392.18]  think it's I think
[5392.18 --> 5393.28]  he's I think he's
[5393.28 --> 5394.04]  coming from gamers
[5394.04 --> 5395.32]  Nexus all right
[5395.32 --> 5398.06]  Steve Jacob says
[5398.06 --> 5399.28]  could do like the
[5399.28 --> 5400.48]  GME when show where
[5400.48 --> 5401.40]  he puts the donations
[5401.40 --> 5403.58]  to write repair yes
[5403.58 --> 5404.76]  we could guys there's
[5404.76 --> 5406.14]  a plan okay I'm
[5406.14 --> 5407.22]  gonna keep I'm gonna
[5407.22 --> 5408.74]  move on Wade says
[5408.74 --> 5409.64]  made a bunch of
[5409.64 --> 5410.78]  money on doge today
[5410.78 --> 5412.18]  here's something to
[5412.18 --> 5412.78]  give back to the
[5412.78 --> 5413.76]  people who revitalize
[5413.76 --> 5414.38]  my interest in
[5414.38 --> 5415.14]  computer hardware and
[5415.14 --> 5416.26]  PC gaming by the
[5416.26 --> 5416.82]  way if you guys ever
[5416.82 --> 5417.62]  looked into a gaming
[5417.62 --> 5419.44]  channel gaming the
[5419.44 --> 5420.64]  gaming space is so
[5420.64 --> 5422.58]  crowded and we got
[5422.58 --> 5423.52]  channel super fun was
[5423.52 --> 5424.66]  almost gaming except
[5424.66 --> 5425.74]  like you guys decided
[5425.74 --> 5426.50]  it wouldn't be
[5426.50 --> 5429.38]  gaming no no the
[5429.38 --> 5432.28]  vote won for toys
[5432.28 --> 5433.42]  oh did it I
[5433.42 --> 5434.46]  thought you did no
[5434.46 --> 5435.44]  I didn't veto it we
[5435.44 --> 5436.72]  made it we each got
[5436.72 --> 5437.96]  to make a pilot we
[5437.96 --> 5438.90]  uploaded a video to
[5438.90 --> 5441.28]  LTT where I did my
[5441.28 --> 5441.94]  version of what I
[5441.94 --> 5442.58]  wanted channel super
[5442.58 --> 5443.60]  fun to be you did
[5443.60 --> 5444.66]  your version and we
[5444.66 --> 5446.34]  let people vote the
[5446.34 --> 5447.82]  people decided it was
[5447.82 --> 5449.44]  toys and it wasn't
[5449.44 --> 5451.22]  gaming and I'm glad
[5451.22 --> 5453.18]  because gaming is
[5453.18 --> 5454.50]  really it's like
[5454.50 --> 5456.04]  hyper competitive man
[5456.04 --> 5456.64]  like on the one
[5456.64 --> 5457.96]  hand you see these
[5457.96 --> 5459.08]  much more work you
[5459.08 --> 5461.00]  see these top 0.1%
[5461.00 --> 5462.08]  influencers in the
[5462.08 --> 5462.96]  gaming space and you
[5462.96 --> 5463.42]  got your doctor
[5463.42 --> 5464.44]  disrespects and
[5464.44 --> 5465.26]  pokey mains of the
[5465.26 --> 5465.78]  world and you go
[5465.78 --> 5466.68]  like yeah like
[5466.68 --> 5467.36]  gaming's where it's
[5467.36 --> 5468.64]  that's awesome it's
[5468.64 --> 5469.86]  like easy money or
[5469.86 --> 5472.00]  whatever it is not
[5472.00 --> 5473.72]  it's not even
[5473.72 --> 5475.00]  compared to youtubers
[5475.00 --> 5476.72]  for every hyper
[5476.72 --> 5477.66]  successful twitch
[5477.66 --> 5478.42]  streamer out there
[5478.42 --> 5480.14]  there are so many
[5480.14 --> 5481.40]  things that no one
[5481.40 --> 5481.94]  is watching
[5481.94 --> 5483.14]  literally no one is
[5483.14 --> 5484.14]  watching something
[5484.14 --> 5485.00]  that's a really
[5485.00 --> 5485.68]  really important
[5485.68 --> 5486.92]  metric too is like if
[5486.92 --> 5487.58]  you look into the
[5487.58 --> 5488.82]  amount of work it
[5488.82 --> 5489.64]  took and like sure
[5489.64 --> 5490.90]  Linus is more and
[5490.90 --> 5491.68]  always has been more
[5491.68 --> 5492.26]  efficient at making
[5492.26 --> 5493.16]  videos than me but if
[5493.16 --> 5493.54]  you look at the
[5493.54 --> 5494.66]  amount of work that
[5494.66 --> 5495.64]  when even if Linus is
[5495.64 --> 5496.40]  making both both
[5496.40 --> 5497.28]  videos or if I was
[5497.28 --> 5497.98]  making both videos
[5497.98 --> 5498.64]  the amount of work
[5498.64 --> 5499.22]  that went into the
[5499.22 --> 5500.44]  game review video
[5500.44 --> 5501.86]  versus the amount of
[5501.86 --> 5502.36]  work that went into
[5502.36 --> 5504.52]  like order gun make
[5504.52 --> 5507.10]  funny with gun release
[5507.10 --> 5508.02]  video like channel
[5508.02 --> 5509.92]  super fun the concept
[5509.92 --> 5511.26]  especially back then
[5511.26 --> 5512.12]  just made way more
[5512.12 --> 5513.08]  sense videos were
[5513.08 --> 5514.44]  faster produced they
[5514.44 --> 5515.32]  were probably more
[5515.32 --> 5516.24]  entertaining they're
[5516.24 --> 5516.96]  more interesting
[5516.96 --> 5518.50]  profitable that's
[5518.50 --> 5519.08]  that's more
[5519.08 --> 5520.04]  profitable just a
[5520.04 --> 5521.24]  minor thing it's a
[5521.24 --> 5522.36]  much better idea
[5522.36 --> 5523.92]  like trying to get
[5523.92 --> 5524.86]  into especially the
[5524.86 --> 5525.46]  idea at that time
[5525.46 --> 5526.20]  was game reviews
[5526.20 --> 5526.80]  trying to get into
[5526.80 --> 5527.52]  game reviews is
[5527.52 --> 5530.70]  murder yeah it's
[5530.70 --> 5532.80]  just yeah uh doug
[5532.80 --> 5533.78]  says got my ltd
[5533.78 --> 5534.86]  desk pad in the first
[5534.86 --> 5535.70]  go round has been
[5535.70 --> 5536.28]  one of the best
[5536.28 --> 5536.86]  products I ever
[5536.86 --> 5537.62]  purchased keep up the
[5537.62 --> 5538.76]  good work yeah if
[5538.76 --> 5539.66]  you guys are into
[5539.66 --> 5540.92]  getting a desk pad I
[5540.92 --> 5542.26]  don't want to be like
[5542.26 --> 5543.66]  act now or there
[5543.66 --> 5544.34]  might not be any
[5544.34 --> 5545.96]  available but it did
[5545.96 --> 5547.06]  take us three and a
[5547.06 --> 5548.14]  half months to restock
[5548.14 --> 5549.42]  because worldwide
[5549.42 --> 5550.54]  logistics is a
[5550.54 --> 5551.60]  freaking nightmare in
[5551.60 --> 5552.32]  case you guys may or
[5552.32 --> 5552.90]  may not have noticed
[5552.90 --> 5555.22]  we made literally the
[5555.22 --> 5557.02]  maximum amount that
[5557.02 --> 5558.28]  the factory could make
[5558.28 --> 5560.32]  and we have already
[5560.32 --> 5563.36]  moved through a fifth
[5563.36 --> 5564.86]  of it and we
[5564.86 --> 5565.82]  relaunched them like
[5565.82 --> 5568.22]  four hours ago so you
[5568.22 --> 5569.34]  guys should I think it's
[5569.34 --> 5570.08]  going to slow down to
[5570.08 --> 5570.74]  be clear I don't think
[5570.74 --> 5571.52]  it's actually going to
[5571.52 --> 5573.46]  move in 20 hours it's
[5573.46 --> 5574.20]  going to slow down a
[5574.20 --> 5575.12]  lot but if you guys
[5575.12 --> 5577.08]  want one ltdstore.com
[5577.08 --> 5578.00]  especially if you want a
[5578.00 --> 5579.98]  particular size remember
[5579.98 --> 5581.82]  we could have stock in
[5581.82 --> 5584.14]  three weeks but the size
[5584.14 --> 5585.84]  you want might be gone in
[5585.84 --> 5587.00]  a couple days we don't
[5587.00 --> 5588.30]  know what exactly people
[5588.30 --> 5589.40]  are going to order and
[5589.40 --> 5590.56]  we were supposed to do a
[5590.56 --> 5591.66]  bunch of analysis on the
[5591.66 --> 5593.44]  first order and figure out
[5593.44 --> 5595.48]  like okay based on the
[5595.48 --> 5597.34]  sales ratio blah blah blah
[5597.34 --> 5598.96]  we need to create these
[5598.96 --> 5600.24]  new sizes and we need to
[5600.24 --> 5601.68]  discontinue these sizes and
[5601.68 --> 5602.48]  we need to order more of
[5602.48 --> 5603.88]  this and less of this but
[5603.88 --> 5605.70]  it all went so fast we
[5605.70 --> 5607.42]  basically just ordered
[5607.42 --> 5608.74]  everything we possibly
[5608.74 --> 5611.46]  could and then figured
[5611.46 --> 5612.34]  okay we'll look at it
[5612.34 --> 5613.50]  next time but now it's
[5613.50 --> 5614.64]  moving with such velocity
[5614.64 --> 5617.78]  again that I think we're
[5617.78 --> 5620.16]  just gonna kind of have to
[5620.16 --> 5621.44]  just knee-jerk reaction
[5621.44 --> 5623.40]  order more again I don't
[5623.40 --> 5625.34]  know I don't know
[5625.34 --> 5630.20]  um tail says recently
[5630.20 --> 5631.48]  built a pc but due to
[5631.48 --> 5632.50]  shortages got stuck with
[5632.50 --> 5634.18]  a 1660 do you know a good
[5634.18 --> 5635.44]  reliable way to get a 3060
[5635.44 --> 5636.74]  or 3070 there will be more
[5636.74 --> 5637.98]  verified actual gamer drops

[5666.00 --> 5667.22]  actually tried to figure I
[5667.22 --> 5668.60]  tried to reach out to AVE
[5668.60 --> 5670.70]  could not get in touch with
[5670.70 --> 5672.50]  him uh apparently he
[5672.50 --> 5673.72]  complained that like his pc
[5673.72 --> 5674.74]  sucked or something and
[5674.74 --> 5676.06]  people were like hey AVE
[5676.06 --> 5677.36]  it's like your Canadian bro
[5677.36 --> 5678.80]  you need to get him a pc and
[5678.80 --> 5682.60]  I was like okay no contact
[5682.60 --> 5684.98]  email no twitter contact no
[5684.98 --> 5687.36]  nothing I was like all right
[5687.36 --> 5689.26]  I did my due diligence at
[5689.26 --> 5690.02]  this point there's nothing I
[5690.02 --> 5691.72]  can do about it I'd love to
[5691.72 --> 5693.02]  collab that'd be fun uh
[5693.02 --> 5694.26]  Hector says can I give some
[5694.26 --> 5695.56]  feedback on the LTT store I
[5695.56 --> 5696.56]  don't like the more recent
[5696.56 --> 5697.88]  designs I think the
[5697.88 --> 5699.02]  controller keyboard and pins
[5699.02 --> 5700.36]  are too direct I don't think
[5700.36 --> 5702.32]  the pins is that direct it's
[5702.32 --> 5704.94]  like pins um but I like the
[5704.94 --> 5706.28]  more abstract ones better so
[5706.28 --> 5707.20]  part of the reason we haven't
[5707.20 --> 5708.50]  been able to do more designs
[5708.50 --> 5709.64]  is that we can't get enough
[5709.64 --> 5711.68]  shirts so launching new t-shirt
[5711.68 --> 5712.70]  designs is something that
[5712.70 --> 5713.82]  we've only really done if you
[5713.82 --> 5715.70]  hadn't if you've noticed uh
[5715.70 --> 5718.86]  with like um more limited run
[5718.86 --> 5720.02]  products like the controller
[5720.02 --> 5721.52]  one because we can't get
[5721.52 --> 5722.68]  enough we're still working on
[5722.68 --> 5724.80]  our own garments but it has
[5724.80 --> 5726.70]  been extremely frustrating so
[5726.70 --> 5728.56]  Steve says oh I never finished
[5728.56 --> 5729.64]  answering that question gaming
[5729.64 --> 5731.08]  content right so we tried to do
[5731.08 --> 5732.48]  an actual games channel that's
[5732.48 --> 5733.56]  probably never going to happen
[5733.56 --> 5735.86]  but what's not impossible Steve
[5735.86 --> 5737.10]  said hey what about another
[5737.10 --> 5739.22]  podcast I love the Carpool
[5739.22 --> 5740.98]  Critics podcast a gaming
[5740.98 --> 5742.46]  podcast is not impossible
[5742.46 --> 5744.34]  that's something that I could
[5744.34 --> 5745.82]  absolutely see having kind of a
[5745.82 --> 5747.92]  rotating roster of LMG peeps
[5747.92 --> 5749.26]  who love games love gaming
[5749.26 --> 5750.58]  and maybe we could even get
[5750.58 --> 5751.70]  Luke on there once in a while
[5751.70 --> 5752.82]  just to talk about like what
[5752.82 --> 5753.88]  are you playing this week just
[5753.88 --> 5755.02]  kind of have some fun segments
[5755.02 --> 5757.30]  and um maybe if people like it
[5757.30 --> 5758.98]  then we'll you know do more of
[5758.98 --> 5760.48]  them uh we are working on a
[5760.48 --> 5761.82]  better podcast set that's going
[5761.82 --> 5763.50]  to be set up so that it
[5763.50 --> 5764.94]  facilitates quick changes of
[5764.94 --> 5766.16]  branding so we'll have like
[5766.16 --> 5767.56]  Carpool Critics wall stuff and
[5767.56 --> 5768.82]  like a color scheme and it'll
[5768.82 --> 5771.00]  just go plunk plunk plunk switch
[5771.00 --> 5772.86]  and it's Carpool Critics and
[5772.86 --> 5773.88]  then we'll go plunk plunk plunk
[5773.88 --> 5776.04]  switch and now it's WAN Show and
[5776.04 --> 5777.14]  then that'll be that would make
[5777.14 --> 5778.24]  it easier for us to add more
[5778.24 --> 5779.48]  podcasts it's also off in a
[5779.48 --> 5780.50]  corner of the warehouse where it
[5780.50 --> 5781.64]  wouldn't disturb other things
[5781.64 --> 5783.44]  being filmed and that's been a
[5783.44 --> 5785.80]  real limiting factor for the
[5785.80 --> 5787.12]  poor Carpool Critics who have had
[5787.12 --> 5789.18]  to shoot in that stupid uh call
[5789.18 --> 5793.44]  room up until now um Mr. Hayden
[5793.44 --> 5794.78]  Jr. says are gamers in the
[5794.78 --> 5795.90]  verified actual gamer program
[5795.90 --> 5797.24]  limited to only one GPU
[5797.24 --> 5798.42]  purchase if not I feel they
[5798.42 --> 5799.40]  should they're absolutely
[5799.40 --> 5802.36]  limited to one GPU purchase in
[5802.36 --> 5805.38]  fact yeah sorry I was gonna say
[5805.38 --> 5807.12]  we had one person who did manage
[5807.12 --> 5809.42]  to get through twice and we
[5809.42 --> 5811.84]  called them and explained that
[5811.84 --> 5815.16]  I'm sorry it we believe you it's
[5815.16 --> 5817.14]  for your girlfriend but we ain't
[5817.14 --> 5819.74]  doing it yeah and they they were
[5819.74 --> 5820.90]  actually they were very cool
[5820.90 --> 5823.08]  about it they totally understood
[5823.08 --> 5825.72]  they they they yeah they were
[5825.72 --> 5827.58]  they were totally chill it there
[5827.58 --> 5830.00]  is someone who got a CPU and a
[5830.00 --> 5832.02]  GPU we deemed those were
[5832.02 --> 5833.78]  obviously very different things so
[5833.78 --> 5835.84]  that was okay uh but we have not
[5835.84 --> 5838.64]  allowed same same line of
[5838.64 --> 5843.32]  products essentially yeah um uh
[5843.32 --> 5844.94]  Robert what's your preferred method
[5844.94 --> 5846.16]  for fans who want to send you long
[5846.16 --> 5849.30]  messages um at the scale I'm at man
[5849.30 --> 5851.44]  I don't want to be that guy but I
[5851.44 --> 5854.72]  prefer they don't if there's like a
[5854.72 --> 5856.28]  support problem or something I'd
[5856.28 --> 5857.20]  love for you to reach out to
[5857.20 --> 5858.80]  floatplane support or LTT store
[5858.80 --> 5860.38]  support if you have a question
[5860.38 --> 5862.20]  about your computer hey we built a
[5862.20 --> 5863.78]  whole forum so that you can engage
[5863.78 --> 5865.52]  with a super active vibrant
[5865.52 --> 5866.54]  community of other tech
[5866.54 --> 5871.22]  enthusiasts I just I just can't I'm
[5871.22 --> 5873.26]  sorry uh Andy says what are the
[5873.26 --> 5874.20]  cleaning instructions for the
[5874.20 --> 5875.94]  desk pad there aren't formally any
[5875.94 --> 5878.10]  but if it's not very dirty you can
[5878.10 --> 5879.48]  take a damp cloth and wipe it down
[5879.48 --> 5882.24]  and if it's really dirty um I have
[5882.24 --> 5883.86]  personally washed it in my washing
[5883.86 --> 5885.96]  machine on cold with a normal amount
[5885.96 --> 5888.12]  and kind of detergent the worst case
[5888.12 --> 5889.56]  scenarios it'll fade a little bit it
[5889.56 --> 5891.12]  shouldn't damage it in any meaningful
[5891.12 --> 5894.84]  way do not tumble dry so wash it cold
[5894.84 --> 5896.64]  take it out hang it to dry and you
[5896.64 --> 5898.06]  should be good to go just make sure you
[5898.06 --> 5899.64]  don't hang it to dry in a way that it's
[5899.64 --> 5902.16]  going to curl up and fold funny so you
[5902.16 --> 5903.84]  would want to have the graphic side up
[5903.84 --> 5904.62]  if you were to hang it over
[5904.62 --> 5906.80]  something all right well I think that's
[5906.80 --> 5909.14]  pretty much it ladies and gentlemen
[5909.14 --> 5910.96]  thank you so much for tuning into the
[5910.96 --> 5913.62]  WAN show this was a really long show
[5913.62 --> 5915.62]  holy crap we were live for over an hour
[5915.62 --> 5918.32]  and a half but um sorry Luke uh
[5918.32 --> 5922.00]  appreciate y'all we'll see you again
[5922.00 --> 5925.38]  next week same bad time same bad channel
[5925.38 --> 5927.52]  oh this is great feedback I'm gonna let
[5927.52 --> 5929.52]  uh Jonathan know Arjun says watch the
[5929.52 --> 5930.98]  MAC address video really good work
[5930.98 --> 5932.92]  amazing I think he did an outstanding
[5932.92 --> 5935.58]  job as well okay bye guys bye
[5935.58 --> 5942.02]  I looked it up because I was confused
[5942.02 --> 5946.26]  because I remember some form of veto with
[5946.26 --> 5949.58]  the channel voting thing so I found the
[5949.58 --> 5952.14]  original thread the poll was gone so I
[5952.14 --> 5954.42]  read through some of the comments I guess
[5954.42 --> 5957.58]  you in you included a and I've done this
[5957.58 --> 5958.78]  a million times and you've done this a
[5958.78 --> 5960.38]  million times you included an option
[5960.38 --> 5961.96]  for people to vote on that was just kind
[5961.96 --> 5964.62]  of like like potato or something and then
[5964.62 --> 5967.18]  everyone voted for it no it was it was
[5967.18 --> 5969.56]  mixed it was like do both on the channel
[5969.56 --> 5972.54]  and then you're like well that's kind of
[5972.54 --> 5975.56]  dumb and then just picked toys which makes
[5975.56 --> 5979.50]  sense I completely forgot about that I
[5979.50 --> 5981.18]  did once I read people talking about that
[5981.18 --> 5983.54]  I was like oh yeah that was not a good
[5983.54 --> 5988.82]  idea all right all right
