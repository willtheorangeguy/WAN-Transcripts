[0.00 --> 9.54]  and we're live welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen got a fantastic show lined up for you
[9.54 --> 17.00]  today uh this is going to be the uh this is kind of the hobbit um approach to WAN show because we
[17.00 --> 21.46]  kind of had uh we had WAN show and then now I guess we're having second WAN show yeah well you
[21.46 --> 26.92]  are I'm having second WAN show but we didn't actually really talk about a ton of tech news
[26.92 --> 31.46]  or what's going on in the in the tech community on the last show then again half the time we don't
[31.46 --> 38.24]  talk about that on regular WAN show either okay the point is gamers nexus bought what I guess is
[38.24 --> 45.38]  there is called a scam pre-built from iBuyPower with a 10 year old gpu in it so we're going to be
[45.38 --> 52.94]  talking a little bit about that um microsoft and qualcomm seem to be determined to make each other's
[52.94 --> 58.04]  platforms less appealing so we're going to kind of jump into that a little bit later what else we
[58.04 --> 66.82]  got here today it's official the pc is the ultimate hardware of all time for gaming for game for gaming
[66.82 --> 73.54]  sure yeah nice nice also tesla is going to use footage that records of you
[73.54 --> 79.62]  that records of what the road it records of you there's a new update to tesla's full self-driving
[79.62 --> 84.40]  driver's assistance program and it's an agreement uh to accept a tesla can use footage from both
[84.40 --> 90.50]  outside and inside the vehicle brilliant who could have seen this coming let's go ahead and roll that
[90.50 --> 90.94]  intro
[90.94 --> 120.10]  and the show today is brought to you by humio secret lab and ridge wallet all right ladies and
[120.10 --> 127.18]  gentlemen obviously we're gonna have to jump right into our first topic of the day pc gamer has
[127.18 --> 135.16]  reported on this surprise surprise games radar has support reported on this um the winner of the 2021
[135.16 --> 147.00]  golden joystick award for the best hold on where is it best gaming hardware okay is the pc so there was
[147.00 --> 155.38]  some uh there were some uh there were some uh some nominees okay playstation 5 xbox series x xbox series
[155.38 --> 165.88]  s nvidia geforce rtx 3080 um nintendo switch oled wd black sn850 nvme ssd so this was the best gaming hardware
[165.88 --> 172.98]  2021 shortlist and then there was ultimate hardware of all time to celebrate 50 years of gaming and
[172.98 --> 185.92]  ultimate game of all time so the ultimate hardware of all time is the pc um which as as much as i'm
[185.92 --> 194.38]  you know as obviously a a lover of the pc gaming platform as much as i you know i get it the best
[194.38 --> 202.72]  individual plant of all time is trees yeah uh it feels it feels just kind of like a puff award
[202.72 --> 208.00]  yeah i okay you know what hot take that's really stupid
[208.00 --> 216.04]  they they should have i kind of hate it they would have actually platform or something
[216.04 --> 222.20]  yeah it would have had to be platform because to say the ultimate hardware of all time you really
[222.20 --> 229.18]  do have to pick a piece of hardware because that means if you're gonna say the pc is the ultimate
[229.18 --> 237.58]  hardware of all time then the pc has to go up against console yeah right and you could make the argument
[237.58 --> 247.20]  that in the early days um home consoles in a way were more revolutionary for gaming acceptance by the
[247.20 --> 256.30]  mainstream than pc gaming was absolutely i mean the nintendo entertainment system was such a was such
[256.30 --> 262.82]  a move towards the mainstream the way the game boy like portable gaming ladies and gentlemen the way
[262.82 --> 267.66]  kind of brought it brought it back because it was it was declining there for a while yeah and nintendo
[267.66 --> 273.70]  even had oh is it far away nintendo even had like the game and watch and stuff like that before before
[273.70 --> 279.28]  the game boy my gaming watch was pre-game boy right like this is all before kind of my time i i my
[279.28 --> 284.64]  family i didn't have a game boy like that was not yeah gaming watch is is before that though yeah that
[284.64 --> 292.06]  was uh that was uh uh uh an optional purchase that was not not gonna happen in my family yeah but um
[292.06 --> 301.62]  like to to put pc up against console is kind of already kind of silly but to consider and how do you define
[301.62 --> 307.22]  ultimate too i i i don't know it's like yeah you can do more with a computer there's there's kind of a
[307.22 --> 314.28]  reason why there's more computer-based twitch stream gamers sure are console ones yeah but like does that
[314.28 --> 321.92]  platform does that make it more ultimate i don't know i don't i don't know that's a really tough um
[321.92 --> 328.16]  that's a really tough sort of question to answer like you know i might i might say okay you know what
[328.16 --> 336.84]  about the uh what about the first gpu with um with like hardware tnl or something like that uh
[336.84 --> 342.34]  oh you know what about this is actually really funny sorry i'm gonna throw this in there uh gabe
[342.34 --> 346.80]  newell accepted the award on behalf of personal computers uh and there's a note here that i don't
[346.80 --> 351.80]  know who wrote this but absolutely uh i agree with them strongly they say and who better to accept
[351.80 --> 359.12]  the hardware award than a man who's famous for developing software i like this is the whole
[359.12 --> 363.82]  problem gabe newell's fantastic he's done amazing things for game he's done amazing things for the
[363.82 --> 367.42]  gaming community the pc gaming community absolutely steam deck looks super cool yeah but let's not
[367.42 --> 372.34]  pretend it's purely altruistic oh not at all okay cool just making sure we're on the same page
[372.34 --> 379.98]  and and and it's not it's not but he has nothing to do with gaming hardware no like i would have been
[379.98 --> 384.76]  i would have been far more modern days a little bit more but like yeah i would have been i would
[384.76 --> 390.86]  have been i would have thought it far more uh fitting if someone like jensen was up there accepting it
[390.86 --> 399.90]  um you know not that he likes talking about that wouldn't be my favorite one anymore but okay but it
[399.90 --> 405.56]  would have been more on the nose for sure the point is that you want to talk about gaming hardware
[405.56 --> 414.30]  yes yeah like he's been involved for sure since the founding of nvidia who is the only og you know
[414.30 --> 423.34]  graphics accelerator company left still around yeah so like let's you know ati purchased and he's been
[423.34 --> 429.12]  there since day zero of nvidia so if you're going to talk about i just don't like it because it's very
[429.12 --> 435.94]  current branded if that makes sense i i mean i don't like it for a variety of reasons but if you
[435.94 --> 441.86]  want to talk about someone who would be appropriate to accept an award on behalf of the pc gaming
[441.86 --> 447.62]  platform i think i i can't think of a better fit gaming hardware specifically gaming hardware so the
[447.62 --> 453.12]  whole problem is that it's not called platform right right because he's also pushing software
[453.12 --> 459.94]  pretty hard now with yeah yeah uh geforce now and stuff like that okay actually geforce now is a
[459.94 --> 466.38]  very hardware heavy thing you just sell it as a software anyways it's it's literally we're not
[466.38 --> 471.68]  going to sell you the hardware it's a yeah it's avoiding gaming it's hardware as a software service
[471.68 --> 478.90]  yeah so i don't know luke i don't know man on the other hand we have the ultimate game of all time
[478.90 --> 489.60]  yeah so how do you choose an ultimate game that's tough that's tough there's there's a big part of me
[489.60 --> 499.20]  would jump to like category founders sure okay so so you would go and you would say okay legend of
[499.20 --> 505.54]  zelda for ness as like sort of the first you could think of it as kind of like the first open world
[505.54 --> 511.26]  you know game i don't know if there's anything open world before that uh what is it called like
[511.26 --> 519.22]  dragon quest or something uh dragon age jumped into my mind but that's not that sure as heck isn't it
[519.22 --> 524.08]  um dragon quest yeah i think it's called dragon quest
[524.08 --> 532.84]  throne throney i'm just guessing at this uh you guys will know what i'm talking about in a little bit
[532.84 --> 540.12]  the first dragon quest was 1986 okay the most recent dragon quest is is to be released soon
[540.12 --> 547.10]  they've been making them forever dragon's lair uh og doom tetris og doom honestly the first thing
[547.10 --> 552.26]  that jumped to my mind was og doom but then i was a little bit like i don't know because i like fps's
[552.26 --> 557.06]  yeah and like i have to try to take my own personal preferences out of it so i'm not entirely sure but
[557.06 --> 564.52]  something like og doom where it's like it it kind of creates a category yeah everything for a long
[564.52 --> 568.56]  time is based on it it is still referenced all those types of things i could see something that
[568.56 --> 574.80]  was like super culturally relevant like uh like a pac-man or something like that yeah because that
[574.80 --> 579.24]  was that was massive for gaming because that was like the whole arcade scene thing like yeah
[579.24 --> 586.90]  pong has some for obvious reasons pretty major first like home game uh like tetris has some
[586.90 --> 590.24]  insane records behind it i sure as heck wouldn't have picked dark souls
[590.24 --> 598.86]  now to be clear it has some pretty intense i'm not hating yeah okay i'm not hating and and i'm
[598.86 --> 604.58]  speaking out of ignorance i have not played dark souls and maybe that should be my next game maybe i
[604.58 --> 611.94]  should play dark souls but i think that it's fair to say that dark souls didn't invent games being
[611.94 --> 619.90]  anything yeah and especially didn't invent games being hard dark souls is a throwback to games being
[619.90 --> 626.84]  hard it's not inventing the idea of games being hard it's far from the first roguelike it's far from
[626.84 --> 632.64]  the first difficult game and if anything previous eras of gaming are far better known for being
[632.64 --> 639.12]  infuriatingly difficult like there are arcade games if you're a if you're a modern gamer and you
[639.12 --> 643.40]  didn't play back then because i know i know what you're saying i know there's literally games that
[643.40 --> 648.86]  are effectively impossible to be no i know yeah um but if you're in if you're because you were saying
[648.86 --> 654.88]  well known for that well so if you're a modern gamer if there's a difficult game it is always
[654.88 --> 660.52]  compared to dark souls this is the dark souls of fps games this is the dark souls of something yeah
[660.52 --> 666.62]  like it is modern relevance it is extremely strong in modern relevance anytime anything is difficult
[666.62 --> 674.64]  i understand that but just because something is culturally relevant today does not mean of all
[674.64 --> 680.72]  time ultimate of all time ultimate of all time because you know i could make the argument again i have
[680.72 --> 688.78]  not played dark souls so fair enough but i i would personally make the argument that in terms of
[688.78 --> 697.22]  like that creating an immersive world is a far better art art example of what can be the art
[697.22 --> 704.34]  of game creation so something like a breath of the wild or a skyrim or something like that would be
[704.34 --> 710.80]  very easily has a lot of claim arguably more important than this game that is known for being
[710.80 --> 716.12]  very difficult do you think it's i'm sort of stealing this from you i'm sorry do you think it's possible
[716.12 --> 722.22]  that they could have had an answer that wouldn't have pissed off the majority of people no yeah so if
[722.22 --> 729.00]  you were gonna just if you were just gonna use a random number generator anyway then just don't have
[729.00 --> 735.68]  the award yeah and i honestly if if i had to guess i would say it's because they just wanted to do
[735.68 --> 740.22]  something different they just wanted to say it's talking about it yeah they wanted to say something
[740.22 --> 745.92]  we wouldn't have talked about it if they'd picked tetris or if they had picked this boring or unreal
[745.92 --> 751.70]  tournament or like like or something like if they had picked because like you could make a solid
[751.70 --> 758.38]  argument for something like unreal tournament unreal tournament was a game changer for multiplayer multiplayer
[758.38 --> 763.14]  online multiplayer so you want to so you want to talk about sort of moments in gaming right like
[763.14 --> 770.32]  pong is so important because it brought gaming into the house right unreal tournament brought gaming over
[770.32 --> 776.18]  the internet multiplayer yeah to the world like real tournament was was the first time that i think in a
[776.18 --> 783.82]  in an average gamer's repertoire the hardware on the isp level that was being provided to you was like
[783.82 --> 788.90]  common terminology used amongst friends that's that's probably the only time that has ever been
[788.90 --> 794.78]  a thing like people were talking about what their isp was was technologically capable of delivering to
[794.78 --> 799.76]  their house not what they were currently receiving yes like this was this was very intense isdn baby
[799.76 --> 805.30]  people were yeah people were paying to have lines brought to their house which is not a huge thing a
[805.30 --> 813.14]  child okay at the time i paid i like i made a deal with my parents if they would pay the monthly
[813.14 --> 820.22]  subscription service because we had satellite tv we had no coax to our house if they would pay the
[820.22 --> 827.16]  monthly subscription i would pay out of my like allowance and money that i worked for to have the
[827.16 --> 832.66]  drop done to our house uh because it was like hundreds of dollars and they were like well we don't care
[832.66 --> 841.16]  we'll use dial up forever and i was like no please no no please no uh can is there any way that i can get
[841.16 --> 848.20]  faster internet and they're like well we did get this quote i was like yes it was probably you know
[848.20 --> 854.02]  what's really funny i never thought about it this way but that was probably my first big ticket purchase
[854.02 --> 862.62]  yeah in my life was the cable drop for high speed internet that should tell you everything you need to
[862.62 --> 871.58]  know about me as a person man what do you think a percentage of your net worth at that time that was
[871.58 --> 876.78]  oh like almost all of it 100 yeah yeah like i was like 12 13 or something like that like i didn't have
[876.78 --> 884.62]  money yeah um that is so funny what was it was it for one thing in particular or was it just you just
[884.62 --> 889.16]  wanted better internet because it was for because you can't use it when your freaking mom's on the phone
[889.16 --> 893.28]  or whatever yeah it was for it was for being able to use the internet more often it was for playing
[893.28 --> 898.66]  games um you you've met my friend tyson yeah yeah so he and i used to try and play games back in the
[898.66 --> 905.26]  dial-up days and his family had two phone lines so that he could like game a lot more than me which
[905.26 --> 910.46]  was good for him but not great for me um so so like we couldn't play a lot of the time so it was for
[910.46 --> 918.50]  that as well and for napster you know we had we had dial-up and we also had i don't remember if this
[918.50 --> 922.38]  is the exact brand of it but you'll know kind of the category of what i'm talking about yeah we had
[922.38 --> 929.50]  dial-up and we had net nanny nice nice got that net nanny it made it so that and this i'm literally
[929.50 --> 933.74]  not exaggerating and there's people that i knew including my brother and my dad and my mom and
[933.74 --> 938.58]  friends from that time that know that i'm not exaggerating i would connect to runescape because i
[938.58 --> 944.26]  played runescape when i was a youngin um and it would take so long to load in once i was loaded in
[944.26 --> 948.42]  it actually wasn't that bad right it would take so long to load in that i could go downstairs computer was
[948.42 --> 954.22]  upstairs yeah downstairs i could make a sandwich and some juice eat the sandwich drink the juice
[954.22 --> 960.78]  and you know how slow i eat you're the worst it's amazing that he grew as large as he did
[960.78 --> 967.66]  at the rate that this man eats like i wouldn't think it possible for him to consume calories
[967.66 --> 974.48]  at a rate greater than he can burn them yeah it's it's rough so like it that's a very substantial
[974.48 --> 978.80]  amount of time some people might think like oh it's it's quick no um and it would be like a bacon
[978.80 --> 983.92]  sandwich like i'd cook bacon like it this is a long this is a long time like peanut butter on no
[983.92 --> 991.72]  no this is this is a like meal sandwich um a meal sandwich i like that and then i'd go upstairs and
[991.72 --> 997.04]  it would sometimes not even be done yet but somehow and even when i was a kid i was like this is crazy
[997.04 --> 1002.60]  it wouldn't time out it would just keep floating it would just keep going eventually i've ever yeah
[1002.60 --> 1006.46]  eventually we'd connect and i'd be able to play and eventually we convinced our parents to get rid
[1006.46 --> 1011.58]  of net nanny and we also had we had the lines to our house but we also had the conversations about
[1011.58 --> 1016.48]  like upgrading our internet and stuff luckily yeah our dad was a gamer so it wasn't that difficult
[1016.48 --> 1025.32]  of a conversation helps yeah oh man anyways it's dark souls whatever yeah i okay i think that we
[1025.32 --> 1031.92]  if we're going to poo poo someone else's choice then i think we have to come up with a better choice
[1031.92 --> 1038.26]  do you want to go first or do you want me to go first um ultimate game to agree no i don't think we
[1038.26 --> 1044.36]  have to agree i think i think we can i think we can push back on each other uh but i i don't think we
[1044.36 --> 1050.10]  have to agree because i've i've actually got one ready that i'm i'm not sure what your take on this
[1050.10 --> 1057.22]  is going to be especially in light of sort of the the current state of things um but okay i would
[1057.22 --> 1064.56]  make the argument if i'm going first i would make the argument for wow i had the same thought i wasn't
[1064.56 --> 1072.56]  going to say it but i think in in in terms of like like moving mountains in a way if you know what i
[1072.56 --> 1076.92]  mean by that i think there's very few games that have done similar things the amount of cultural impact
[1076.92 --> 1082.90]  is huge yep the amount of people that played it not as much these days sure yep but like at its peak
[1082.90 --> 1091.86]  literally everyone i knew played yep and it's still millions huge it's constantly going down
[1091.86 --> 1097.26]  it's constantly going extremely poor management etc etc but it's still huge i don't i still wouldn't
[1097.26 --> 1103.08]  say the ultimate game of all time necessarily though personally but i understand the argument
[1103.08 --> 1108.56]  there's no perfect and i think there is no perfect okay so beat me then come up with a better choice
[1108.56 --> 1115.88]  yeah so i was i was gonna say doom doom doom really it's boring it is a boring choice it's a boring
[1115.88 --> 1121.20]  choice wow is definitely a more interesting choice i thought about wow 2 i just the reason why i think
[1121.20 --> 1131.30]  doom is it's even in the big gap you know before doom 2016 yeah and after the the last one whatever
[1131.30 --> 1136.66]  one that was yeah even in that big gap doom was still very culturally relevant there were still
[1136.66 --> 1143.78]  people going like whoa i got it working on this toaster now it's funny both of us seemed to gravitate
[1143.78 --> 1150.32]  to cultural relevance for our measure it's it's the ultimate game i think it has to be to a certain
[1150.32 --> 1158.78]  degree but does it couldn't the ultimate game just have fortress amazing amazing music pretty amazing
[1158.78 --> 1165.62]  art direction amazing story doesn't an ultimate game have to have everything and to me to call doom
[1165.62 --> 1173.38]  ultimate in this day and age for how technologically limited and how by modern standards rudimentary it is
[1173.38 --> 1181.66]  and and to be clear i'm i'm making arguments against my own so are you only saying wow 2004
[1181.66 --> 1191.06]  i am not yes i am talking about okay wow not what it's become okay okay okay okay
[1191.06 --> 1199.54]  i don't know i don't know it's so hard i don't know it's really difficult and the thing is that to
[1199.54 --> 1209.44]  to pick an ultimate game right it is inherently it's inherently sort of um within within the scope of
[1209.44 --> 1215.00]  your own experiences right like it's hard to detach yourself you know i i would i would love to say
[1215.00 --> 1223.12]  that you know uh final fantasy 6 is the ultimate game because in in my mind there are a lot of things
[1223.12 --> 1230.92]  that it did as well or better than almost any modern game and it managed to do it in 1994 or whenever
[1230.92 --> 1236.96]  whenever it came out something something like that um you know that that incredible cast of characters
[1236.96 --> 1245.08]  like the the the the story the music so good i if you can basically copy paste everything you said
[1245.08 --> 1250.00]  about that and apply it to wow 2004 and i kind of feel the same way yeah so like yeah i don't know
[1250.00 --> 1257.56]  and it's just for me wow has this extremely tarnished legacy which sucks but then sure does like a lot of
[1257.56 --> 1263.24]  so does a lot of the entire gaming industry yes so it's like which is part of why this conversation
[1263.24 --> 1268.12]  about what's going on at activision blizzard is so important i was telling this story a few days ago
[1268.12 --> 1273.00]  about tattoos i don't i don't have any tattoos i'm not against tattoos right i just think i don't care
[1273.00 --> 1279.28]  okay sure fair enough uh and like why bother get it if i just don't care um but when i was younger i
[1279.28 --> 1283.30]  like sort of maybe wanted one but i couldn't decide on what i wanted so i wasn't gonna get something for
[1283.30 --> 1289.84]  no reason yeah um and i was like this really really diehard fan of morrowind and oblivion so i was like
[1289.84 --> 1294.68]  maybe i should get the like the dragon yeah i was like that'd be thank goodness you didn't
[1294.68 --> 1300.88]  yeah yeah and the reason why i didn't was because at that time i luckily had the thought of like
[1300.88 --> 1302.48]  you know they're still making these
[1302.48 --> 1313.42]  i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do this if if there's like this chance that they're gonna just ruin it
[1313.42 --> 1320.06]  yeah i love that i love that um that's great and you know what you know what's really funny
[1320.06 --> 1327.42]  is i can't claim to have had a similar thought but if there is a brand that i have ever fanboyed for
[1327.42 --> 1331.68]  harder than anything else it would be star wars
[1331.68 --> 1341.68]  oh no yeah exactly right like that's how much would it suck yeah to have like i mean you know what
[1341.68 --> 1346.30]  the thing about star wars is that at least if they're gonna you can head cannon it pretty hard
[1346.30 --> 1353.58]  if there's that and at least if they're gonna destroy it um they they destroy the the names
[1353.58 --> 1358.66]  and the logos for the new destroyed garbage oh it's different like older it's a little bit so if
[1358.66 --> 1364.24]  you have like an og like rebel alliance you know tattoo on your shoulder blade or something like that
[1364.24 --> 1369.22]  they're gonna go to that timeline though i bet you at some point it's there's no way it's sacred
[1369.22 --> 1375.10]  there's no way yeah nothing is sacred nothing is sacred and i don't even want to hear it chat the
[1375.10 --> 1382.52]  the new star wars movies are objectively trash kind of garbage yeah um and it's so disappointing
[1382.52 --> 1390.34]  especially because i think disney did such a great job with marvel overall i gotta admit post endgame
[1390.34 --> 1397.60]  i'm kind of checked out on mcu there's just been so much it's just kind of too much and it felt like
[1397.60 --> 1405.54]  they did this amazing job of largest you know collab of all time um and giving this closure
[1405.54 --> 1411.86]  and then i just like i watched and now they still want the next one and i i forget what the next one
[1411.86 --> 1417.16]  was spider-man something spider-man far from home something like that something like that and i was
[1417.16 --> 1423.68]  just like yeah this is this is like entertaining and i watched black widow and i was like yeah this is
[1423.68 --> 1429.44]  entertaining probably all gonna be fine like the mcu has has a very solid base minimum you know but i'm
[1429.44 --> 1435.78]  just not that engaged and it's not even that like iron man was my like favorite avenger or something
[1435.78 --> 1441.98]  like i'm an adult i don't have a favorite color or like a favorite a favorite fictional character like
[1441.98 --> 1446.12]  i just don't really i don't really engage with things that way anymore the way that i used to
[1446.12 --> 1453.28]  like you might so i would say that i probably have a favorite avenger but the amount that i care
[1453.28 --> 1460.18]  is extremely low if that makes sense sure okay okay you know what i i mean if we're gonna be
[1460.18 --> 1465.12]  completely off topic and talking about crap that totally doesn't matter anyway who is your favorite
[1465.12 --> 1472.36]  avenger luke captain america okay i i knew it i'm boring today i wanted to i wanted to i picked doom
[1472.36 --> 1480.22]  i wanted to say it before you but you said it so fast i was like gee a blonde haired blue eyed
[1480.22 --> 1487.48]  freaking always stands up for the little guy guy i wonder i wonder who luke would be a fan of
[1487.48 --> 1492.78]  i like captain america he's cool i based my haircut off of him i love it yeah yeah i do actually know
[1492.78 --> 1497.70]  that i wait no i thought you picked thor for your more recent haircut i tried and it didn't work so i
[1497.70 --> 1502.70]  went back to captain america because it's who i really am oh my goodness all right
[1502.70 --> 1510.24]  yeah notice how it's short again yes yeah all right okay so i just kind of looked like a mess
[1510.24 --> 1516.72]  all right cap see but then yeah i don't actually really care so like there's there's that component
[1516.72 --> 1522.28]  all right fair enough like if he dies i don't even know he might be dead now i i haven't kept up with
[1522.28 --> 1529.40]  the movies yeah i think he dies of old age so yeah it's like not gonna bother me so all right um i i
[1529.40 --> 1535.60]  you know what people are asking they're discussing my favorite my favorite marvel superhero i straight
[1535.60 --> 1542.54]  up do not have one i have least favorite ones i have ones that i just find intolerable but other
[1542.54 --> 1547.56]  than that i just don't really who's your least do we do we go down this my least favorite is superman
[1547.56 --> 1553.92]  and he's just boringly and and all variants of superman there's a lot of them yeah so there's there's
[1553.92 --> 1560.64]  a lot of superman like captain marvel is superman superman is superman like it's just it's not
[1560.64 --> 1571.10]  interesting um i like i i tend to i tend to like you know your batmans and your uh i guess iron man to
[1571.10 --> 1579.52]  an extent like the ones that are just like a person yeah uh with no particular special powers
[1579.52 --> 1585.96]  bulletproof yeah and everything else proof bulletproof is not interesting because a lot of the
[1585.96 --> 1592.20]  a lot of the interesting conflicts that can happen are with you know the grunt level soldiers so being
[1592.20 --> 1601.94]  able to just mow them down by whipping out your laser eyes it just it creates this sort of um
[1601.94 --> 1607.00]  disposability you also have and i think the mcu might be running into this but i don't care enough
[1607.00 --> 1612.50]  to know so whatever yeah you have a power ramp issue when you start fighting gods all the time
[1612.50 --> 1618.54]  or or god-like beings or whatever you want to call them yes you you have this crazy power ramp issue
[1618.54 --> 1626.56]  but if humanoid targets are always at least somewhat difficult if they're if they could
[1626.56 --> 1633.14]  conceivably take you down yeah uh bite pond says batman and superman are not marvel characters yes
[1633.14 --> 1640.94]  but my point super so captain marvel would be a terrible marvel superhero in my opinion because
[1640.94 --> 1646.16]  she's superman it's a yeah it's just the like incredibly overpowered and vulnerable
[1646.16 --> 1652.70]  hulk more or less can fly has extremely narrow range of vulnerabilities a superman alike can go
[1652.70 --> 1661.24]  anywhere instantly and do anything is not interesting um so you know hulk is more more interesting to me
[1661.24 --> 1668.72]  i think the hulk's pretty cool i think in terms of like marvel heroes that i i find boring um you know i
[1668.72 --> 1675.28]  i think scarlett johansson did an amazing job of everything that she was given i wish she was given a
[1675.28 --> 1683.86]  slightly less crap hero to play um yeah yeah because they and part of that is just a writing problem
[1683.86 --> 1690.30]  they never really took advantage of her strength yes okay i was just gonna say i i like that style of
[1690.30 --> 1693.94]  quote-unquote superhero though yes because she is just a person and we were just talking about how
[1693.94 --> 1698.60]  that's cool yes but i think she's underutilized she was yeah horribly poorly written probably the best
[1698.60 --> 1704.88]  moment for her in the entire like i guess it's like 25 movies is sort of start to avengers endgame
[1704.88 --> 1713.10]  the best moment for her is when she's captured by someone supposedly and uh she's like you know been
[1713.10 --> 1718.60]  you know hit and she's tied to a chair and she gets a phone call and she's like look i'm in the middle of
[1718.60 --> 1723.94]  an interrogation um because they're like telling her everything and i'm like right that's what she's
[1723.94 --> 1729.34]  supposed to do she's supposed to be stealthy and then you've got her like going toe-to-toe with the
[1729.34 --> 1735.26]  rest of the avengers on that stupid air uh airstrip and i'm like i think they're going to have used her
[1735.26 --> 1740.88]  like espionage side of things way much more yeah yeah so that that was extremely disappointing
[1740.88 --> 1747.06]  yeah uh anyway this is this is extraordinarily off topic do we have any other tech things that we can
[1747.06 --> 1752.70]  talk about uh are we done whatever topic we're currently on i i can't remember what we're talking
[1752.70 --> 1758.34]  about it's official pc's the ultimate hardware all the time okay so no it's not because that's really
[1758.34 --> 1764.92]  stupid and dark souls is also not because that's really stupid they're both they're both really
[1764.92 --> 1773.50]  stupid i'm sorry oh my oh you you do you golden joystick all right what do you want to talk about
[1773.50 --> 1777.84]  next we can do this one just because it's fast sure we can offboard onto this onto sponsors maybe
[1777.84 --> 1784.76]  but tesla uh now to use footage it records of you essentially for this is not a fast topic we got to
[1784.76 --> 1790.02]  talk about this okay for the full self-driving assistance program uh in its agreement it says
[1790.02 --> 1795.46]  it is going to use footage from outside and inside the vehicle uh while incident footage has been gathered
[1795.46 --> 1801.68]  before for ai training the new agreement consents to tesla's collection of vin associated image data
[1801.68 --> 1808.50]  so if you get in a crash while using it tesla will have the footage from your car um so wow you spend
[1808.50 --> 1815.86]  an incredible amount of money for some incredibly extensive surveillance of you
[1815.86 --> 1824.66]  wow i can understand how this data would be useful oh yeah i'm also stunned because
[1824.66 --> 1833.90]  if i'm tesla i'm looking at it going hey at some point a regulatory body is going to come after me
[1833.90 --> 1842.58]  when there's some kind of collision and 16 16 people die we hit a bus yep it's all kids people care
[1842.58 --> 1850.18]  about kids a lot yep i need to cover my butt in terms of liability that is why this is happening
[1850.18 --> 1859.40]  full stop so don't imagine anything other than that this is about tesla protecting their own
[1859.40 --> 1866.74]  liability so that in the event that that happens they are going to do absolutely everything they
[1866.74 --> 1872.84]  can to pin it on the driver i don't in in our notes there there isn't a reason so i can't even like
[1872.84 --> 1879.02]  really debate back because i can't think of i mean it would because it's full self-driving that's the
[1879.02 --> 1886.50]  confusing part to me well full in full self-driving you are still supposed to be hands basically on
[1886.50 --> 1895.10]  the wheel right yeah so this is so there's like there's a number of problems here right there's
[1895.10 --> 1902.54]  the problem that tesla is still using that full self-driving and autopilot branding when neither of
[1902.54 --> 1911.56]  those things are either of those things um and the other problem is that people are using this
[1911.56 --> 1917.72]  technology which is which is not validated it's not fully cooked and they're using it on public roads
[1917.72 --> 1925.34]  without any kind of i mean really anything like if i was an insurer at this point i would be trying to
[1925.34 --> 1933.48]  figure out you know if your car has has this kind of a feature i'd be trying to figure out what what
[1933.48 --> 1939.44]  impact that does or should have on your premium because if something goes wrong i don't even know
[1939.44 --> 1945.22]  who i'm gonna go after for it like it's getting it's gonna get really complicated so electric's website
[1945.22 --> 1953.54]  yeah says specifically that uh the fact that tesla added that language specifically related to safety
[1953.54 --> 1959.20]  risks and accidents would point towards the automaker looking to secure usable evidence in case of an
[1959.20 --> 1963.44]  accident where its full self-driving system is blamed so yeah they're trying to use it against you
[1963.44 --> 1968.98]  well that's what electric thinks as well essentially they're agreeing with you uh fantastic says they
[1968.98 --> 1976.12]  really just need to change the names yeah they really do because ultimately what's going to happen
[1976.12 --> 1981.26]  is people are going to make assumptions because people do not read detailed documentation on things
[1981.26 --> 1988.26]  okay in my defense on that whole deleting the desktop environment basically nobody does that was that
[1988.26 --> 1994.66]  was terminology that even if i had read it i would not have understood that i was removing my entire
[1994.66 --> 1998.86]  desktop environment or i might have if i was paying really careful attention
[1998.86 --> 2004.54]  but not when i was reading like i was just doing something basic like installing a program
[2004.54 --> 2011.28]  anyway anyway the point is people don't read these things they make assumptions based on the names of
[2011.28 --> 2018.12]  of things like if i okay this product okay it's called the water bottle let's say for example it was
[2018.12 --> 2024.14]  actually a hammer it was actually yeah it was actually i mean it might be an okay hammer but it'd probably
[2024.14 --> 2029.66]  do all right but at some point i'm probably in my use of it as a hammer i'm probably going to make
[2029.66 --> 2038.04]  some kind of mistake that will cause damage to my hammer or myself and you know if we installed a
[2038.04 --> 2045.18]  camera in every one of these the water bottle hammers uh so that we could prove that when you know you
[2045.18 --> 2049.78]  break the vacuum seal and it causes some kind of a problem or something so that we could prove that it
[2049.78 --> 2057.78]  was because you were using it as a a hammer instead of a water bottle or whatever um you know i
[2057.78 --> 2068.76]  oh man i wonder what happens if you cover the internal cameras oh i'm pretty sure that it's
[2068.76 --> 2074.94]  going to disable your your your self-driving oh sorry yeah it would have to yeah obviously so then
[2074.94 --> 2080.50]  that's the thing too is like tesla is now pulling a bait and switch here because anyone who already
[2080.50 --> 2086.62]  paid for full self-driving and tesla has been selling full self-driving whether directly whether
[2086.62 --> 2093.64]  actually taking your money or or selling it as a future promise it'll work on this car for years now
[2093.64 --> 2101.46]  so they have effectively promised something whether it is future self-driving capabilities for your
[2101.46 --> 2107.34]  vehicle that you can upgrade to or whether it is an actual software package that you have paid them for
[2107.34 --> 2115.78]  they have promised this under a set of conditions that is no longer accurate so you could make the
[2115.78 --> 2123.90]  argument and they got sued recently actually over um someone buying a version of a tesla vehicle that
[2123.90 --> 2129.18]  tesla said would be compatible with full self-driving that they then went back to them and said well it's
[2129.18 --> 2133.12]  compatible in the sense that you can buy this hardware pay for new hardware in order to upgrade
[2133.12 --> 2137.56]  them they're like uh actually no that isn't what you said so they're being sued for that i believe
[2137.56 --> 2143.86]  right now um but i could see i could see this going class action and i could see people suing them saying
[2143.86 --> 2151.00]  well look i wouldn't have made this purchase if i had realized that having a camera pointed at me
[2151.00 --> 2157.40]  that is feeding data obviously feeding data onto your server whether they admitted it before or not i
[2157.40 --> 2163.18]  actually don't remember but it was obviously doing it so this is feeding data onto your server that
[2163.18 --> 2170.44]  monitors me while i'm in a my understanding is at least in many jurisdictions a private place i didn't
[2170.44 --> 2175.80]  know they had inside your car it is yeah it is um i didn't know they had internal cameras at all
[2175.80 --> 2179.98]  personally oh yeah they do yeah i just didn't know yeah they're to monitor driver attentiveness but
[2179.98 --> 2187.84]  the claim my understanding is the claim in the past has been that it's locally handled that it's just
[2187.84 --> 2194.58]  monitoring driver attentiveness oh they might just be changing that it might not send it yeah yeah right
[2194.58 --> 2202.14]  oh i see what you mean okay either way yeah if i bought this car based on my understanding that it
[2202.14 --> 2209.64]  worked as a local attentiveness monitoring thing then effectively that could be an enormous
[2209.64 --> 2214.36]  class action you could i could see people potentially getting refunded for the full self-driving
[2214.36 --> 2221.88]  module if you get or not even that remember the vehicle as well if you bought the vehicle on the
[2221.88 --> 2229.34]  basis of this perceived upgrade path even if you don't own a full self-driving module you might make
[2229.34 --> 2236.12]  the argument that i spent an extra x i spent an extra eight thousand dollars on a tesla because my
[2236.12 --> 2240.08]  understanding was that i was going to have full self-driving that did not involve a camera pointed
[2240.08 --> 2249.60]  at me and reporting on me to big brother this could be freaking enormous enormous it could be freaking
[2249.60 --> 2254.18]  enormous aj says they were saying that it was disabled and would be utilized for the self-driving
[2254.18 --> 2260.30]  taxi feature in the event of vandalism irc this is a big problem with tesla is they just yeah they
[2260.30 --> 2264.94]  change stuff i mean we know who's the problem right they're just they just talk out their butts
[2264.94 --> 2270.90]  and then the story changes and the tesla fanboys and apologists just say oh but it's okay because
[2270.90 --> 2276.46]  they're changing the world they're building the future right but the ends don't justify the means
[2276.46 --> 2282.26]  like we actually do need to have integrity about this future that we're building otherwise is it one
[2282.26 --> 2287.40]  that we really want to live in is a question we should be asking ourselves another question is is this
[2287.40 --> 2294.58]  the ultimate car scandal of all time i'm kidding it's not no there's been some pretty big car scandals
[2294.58 --> 2301.62]  there's a single automaker that is faultless i mean we've all seen the how many people is it
[2301.62 --> 2307.34]  going to kill versus the cost of the recall calculations yeah um you know every corporation
[2307.34 --> 2313.82]  past a certain size as far as i can tell is basically monstrous yeah so yep that's the thing
[2313.82 --> 2322.08]  uh-huh clem says no that would definitely be nicola nicola motors where they like actually
[2322.08 --> 2327.30]  had nothing and they were claiming they had like a semi that worked but actually they like rolled it
[2327.30 --> 2332.84]  down a hill and stuff you didn't follow that i forgot about those guys yeah wait what happened that was
[2332.84 --> 2339.74]  like the theranos of cars they yeah they just as far as we could tell they had absolutely nothing did
[2339.74 --> 2347.32]  they take like investment money or something okay yeah i remember hearing about i like i i probably saw
[2347.32 --> 2353.98]  that video of that truck rolling down the hill uh but yeah that's it yeah oh man
[2353.98 --> 2362.64]  anyways sponsors yeah we should definitely do sponsors um who who sponsored the show today i'm sure
[2362.64 --> 2371.60]  someone did who meal our first sponsor lttsstore.com oh yeah that's right i'm going there ltt has a black
[2371.60 --> 2379.10]  friday deal if you add a meme product to the cart so that is the uh where is it
[2379.10 --> 2384.32]  why are these why are these not on the front page dang it we've got a sale running we've got a sale
[2384.32 --> 2393.22]  running you guys so if you add a meme face sequin pillow or a sad linus or linus selfie desk pad or
[2393.22 --> 2399.88]  mouse pad uh you'll get 20 off orders over 30 so basically you buy these and one other thing
[2399.88 --> 2407.14]  and you're getting the the pillow or the mouse or desk pad for like five bucks or ten bucks respectively
[2407.14 --> 2412.30]  so there you go these sequin pillows are hilarious because you can like draw on them because they're
[2412.30 --> 2419.16]  sequin pillows hold on see see that's that's one of my favorites actually this is probably my favorite
[2419.16 --> 2429.22]  sunglasses and joint linus anyway um right so the actual sponsors of the show
[2429.22 --> 2434.88]  uh are you managing the meme mess or the merch messages as they come in i definitely haven't been
[2434.88 --> 2438.52]  yeah cool i have been but if you could just do the ones right now while i'm not looking at it
[2438.52 --> 2448.26]  uh what is the how do i do this uh-oh um uh-oh i am actually quite confused i think i have broken
[2448.26 --> 2456.44]  the stream deck uh oh uh-oh what is this oh no it's back on the previous profile it's not on

[2622.16 --> 2629.22]  logging everything with humio at the link down below uh so luke uh my stream deck no longer has
[2629.22 --> 2637.92]  wan show things on it it has earlier black friday show things on it so if we could also um fix that or at the
[2637.92 --> 2642.96]  very least just put it back on the uh yeah back on the regular lower third
[2642.96 --> 2652.28]  the scene collection changed got it wonderful what's up nick have i have i what have i gotten in
[2652.28 --> 2657.82]  trouble for doing anything like wearing this jacket on the stream earlier i i'm showing off more more ltt
[2657.82 --> 2663.50]  store stuff oh there was actually something that i totally wanted to leak what was it ah
[2663.50 --> 2669.34]  oh man it was something super cool that i had wanted to talk about i give up all right what's up
[2669.34 --> 2678.50]  yeah yeah that's fine um i just i updated the discount in the document earlier and it's different
[2678.50 --> 2682.92]  than what you said oh it's different than what i said because the shopify discount implementation is
[2682.92 --> 2688.84]  like not oh crap okay sorry the shopify discount implementation is like doesn't allow the thing
[2688.84 --> 2696.08]  something something use bfcm to save 15 on any linus face meme products we can change it to 20 20
[2696.08 --> 2700.86]  is fine well you don't have to buy anything else oh you don't have to buy anything else oh yeah no
[2700.86 --> 2707.72]  that would be bad then okay yep yeah so sorry it's only 15 instead of 20 yeah no sorry we would be
[2707.72 --> 2715.74]  we'd be eating it on that one that would be not very good hey thanks nick hey there you go
[2715.74 --> 2723.10]  uh datam says why is your shipping to the eu so expensive because the eu is super far away
[2723.10 --> 2732.10]  because shipping to the eu is expensive yeah we're so our average markup on shipping is i think
[2732.10 --> 2737.54]  somewhere in the neighborhood of five percent right now or are we even making money on oh it's negative
[2737.54 --> 2746.18]  10 percent now uh we're trying to fix it okay yeah it's supposed to be his his margin target for
[2746.18 --> 2751.70]  shipping is 10 so that we'll have like a slush bucket so that we can use to run ship you mightn't
[2751.70 --> 2755.64]  have noticed we haven't run any shipping promos in a very long time that's because there's no slush
[2755.64 --> 2762.40]  bucket i didn't know we were losing money on shipping though cool you did know that did i know that okay
[2762.40 --> 2768.58]  well i've forgotten that i have a few was it his idea um no okay someone's like can i recommend a
[2768.58 --> 2775.12]  warehouse nearby no you can't operating an additional warehouse is not going to help us save on overhead
[2775.12 --> 2782.04]  yeah we're fixing it yeah no no that would just you'd just be paying for it in the cost of the product
[2782.04 --> 2787.06]  instead of paying for it in the shipping so you're solving one problem adding another
[2787.06 --> 2797.60]  oh man all right uh yeah why don't we get back to the topics that was a very disruptive thing ah
[2797.60 --> 2805.56]  yes it is wonderful so now i can say words and damn uh hopefully i just tried out my new swear bleep
[2805.56 --> 2813.40]  button so we're gonna see we're gonna see if that worked oh man i love this show that's why that's why
[2813.40 --> 2823.82]  this show is so great oh okay uh everett h asks for an update on the kickstarter hammer sent a merch
[2823.82 --> 2828.80]  message there isn't one there's no update no update no update on the kickstarter hammer yeah all right
[2828.80 --> 2838.54]  what do you want to talk about um let's see let's go through some topics gpu prices are going up again
[2838.54 --> 2848.64]  oh shoot the timing is apparently off for the beep oh oh boy okay well um linus please this is a
[2848.64 --> 2856.24]  christian stream oh no okay well i thought i was bleeping it that's extremely unfortunate there's a delay
[2856.24 --> 2861.66]  from when you press the button that's a pretty rough system thorny green this is not a green screen
[2861.66 --> 2872.28]  is there is there any eta on it being like not this uh no there's no eta on that but it's definitely
[2872.28 --> 2879.40]  not a green screen yeah it just looks oh my goodness great uh oh people want the code people
[2879.40 --> 2883.70]  want the code for the for the discount okay we gotta we gotta sell some linus me gonna buy your
[2883.70 --> 2891.56]  meme products meme face products here and uh i can't find it where is it oh here we go here bfcm
[2891.56 --> 2906.14]  bfcm here you go guys bfcm is the code my brain hurts now all right um what are we talking about
[2906.14 --> 2911.20]  let's start a topic sure oh my goodness people aren't even tuning out they seem to be they seem
[2911.20 --> 2916.68]  to be enjoying the technical difficulties more than the show itself viewership's going like this fire
[2916.68 --> 2925.78]  no no more fire no enough fire more fires more viewers we need more fire no stop stop someone
[2925.78 --> 2933.38]  knock the wall down no please speaking of more fire gpu prices are going up again
[2933.38 --> 2939.46]  uh i didn't even want to talk about this because we don't have to sad no just do it talk me through it
[2939.46 --> 2945.32]  a post on a board on the board channels forum indicates that amd prices are set to increase by
[2945.32 --> 2952.90]  10 percent apparently this is mostly due to tsmc foundry costs going up the next shipment of amd rx
[2952.90 --> 2959.04]  6000 gpus should reflect the price increase of roughly 20 to 40 usd per card this cost is currently
[2959.04 --> 2966.06]  affecting uh add-in board partners uh so if we're lucky that won't be passed on to the consumer lol
[2966.06 --> 2973.42]  uh there's not enough margin there's literally no chance yeah that is not a thing i'm gonna say
[2973.42 --> 2980.22]  that's a zero percent uh probability oh yeah yeah that's that literally can't work like he was saying
[2980.22 --> 2985.22]  the margins are so low it's just it's not gonna it's not gonna happen um there are rumors that amd is
[2985.22 --> 2996.04]  switching from tsmc to samsung that would be really interesting yeah i doubt it yeah i mean going from
[2996.04 --> 3004.36]  one process node to another one like that is not uh i mean it's possible that amd was already
[3004.36 --> 3010.52]  working on that if it's if it's been in the in the works for a while then sure but like yeah but i
[3010.52 --> 3015.02]  doubt they're trying to figure out how to dual source their current products that's probably going
[3015.02 --> 3021.88]  to be something that's more like rdna 3 or something like that yeah a lot of their recent
[3021.88 --> 3026.76]  success has been working with tsmc absolutely that's very true a lot of a lot of everyone's
[3026.76 --> 3033.08]  recent success has been working with tsmc i think you can pretty much draw a line in between people
[3033.08 --> 3043.24]  with recent success and people who don't work with tsmc um with this news coming off the heels of the 10
[3043.24 --> 3050.28]  price hike humor or sorry rumor uh it it may be that amd simply can't afford to continue using tsmc
[3051.88 --> 3058.14]  that one i'm not so certain about but it would definitely eat margins really badly yeah and
[3058.14 --> 3063.98]  i can understand why they would want a price hike um samsung is apparently building a new 17
[3063.98 --> 3069.96]  billion dollar advanced chip plant in texas an estimated production start date of 2024 it will
[3069.96 --> 3074.68]  also as far as my understanding goes take them a fair amount of time to like warm up to their full
[3074.68 --> 3083.78]  capabilities yeah um and they could make apparently chips as advanced as three nanometer dang whoa dang
[3083.78 --> 3089.56]  whoa three nanometer sounds pretty good that's that's very few nanometers that is a very small
[3089.56 --> 3096.40]  that's a very small number that is a 100 confirmed very small amount of yeah no not that's not enough
[3096.40 --> 3101.52]  nanometers quite frankly we need more i think i need more nanometers i mean why do we accept three
[3101.52 --> 3107.00]  nanometers when we could have 35 nanometers yeah i'm cheesed well maybe 35 is too much i think 14 is
[3107.00 --> 3111.96]  the right number of nanometers the exact perfect amount let's go back to 14 should never move off
[3111.96 --> 3122.34]  of let's have 14 nanometers forever oh boy okay so yeah that's a thing that's sad yeah that's like
[3122.34 --> 3130.08]  really disappointing but also basically has already been happening this is just in my mind yeah uh amd and
[3130.08 --> 3138.84]  tsmc just clawing back some of the value that had been scooped up by bottom feeders later on in the
[3138.84 --> 3146.08]  chain i mean this comes back to a conversation we had more recently where we talked about okay um
[3146.08 --> 3151.46]  if a gpu is going to be a thousand dollars instead of five hundred dollars who should get that money right
[3151.46 --> 3157.44]  should it be tsmc and amd who like actually made investments and designed and built these things
[3157.44 --> 3165.80]  or should it be some scalper on facebook marketplace if someone has to have it i guess it should be
[3165.80 --> 3171.16]  like you know the people putting the people putting the r&d into the product so that so that at the end
[3171.16 --> 3179.76]  of the day at least if it sucks for gamers today in theory it turns into bigger r&d budgets for better
[3179.76 --> 3187.12]  products for gamers in the future if capitalism is working correctly or or hopefully more fab capacity
[3187.12 --> 3194.06]  or whatever that's exactly it yeah so so it can be reinvested yeah because some facebook marketplace
[3194.06 --> 3201.22]  you know scalper is not reinvesting in any way other than to build a better bot so that they can
[3201.22 --> 3210.58]  scalp you harder next time yeah oh uh gamers nexus want to talk about this one yeah let's talk about
[3210.58 --> 3221.02]  gamers nexus buys a scam in quotes pre-built from ibuypower with a 10 year old gpu yikes it's the ibuypower
[3221.02 --> 3231.30]  element mini 167a for 700 bucks it has a ryzen 5 3600 uh it's eight gigabytes of 3000 megahertz ram a 250
[3231.30 --> 3246.18]  gigabyte ssd and a two gigabyte gt 730 which is a 730 in name only it is a fermi gf 108-300-a1 aka a gt 430
[3246.18 --> 3253.26]  oh that wasn't even a good card when it came out um was that literally the card no i don't think so
[3253.26 --> 3259.96]  i don't think so you know what i'm talking about 10 or something or 240 or something i know what you're
[3259.96 --> 3267.78]  talking about yeah yeah yeah um big yikes the amazon listing they bought it from uh had a bunch of
[3267.78 --> 3273.98]  mistakes like listing 16 gigabytes of ram one gigabyte hard drive in a four core processor what okay
[3273.98 --> 3279.12]  unsurprisingly this is the worst pre-built they've ever bought most benchmark games they use wouldn't
[3279.12 --> 3284.70]  even run games that did run had horrible performance uh the ano performs better than
[3284.70 --> 3292.20]  this thing nice a neo i gotta i gotta confess um i kind of feel like this is sort of a water is wet
[3292.20 --> 3299.78]  yeah like wait what uh revelation here because pre-built with old crappy gpus um many of which are
[3299.78 --> 3309.02]  rebranded even older crappy gpus are not really a new thing um to be clear i don't think
[3309.02 --> 3317.24]  ibuypower should be marketing this as a gaming desktop at all that's really stupid but this also
[3317.24 --> 3324.56]  isn't really anything new like i remember buying at future shop we talked about good old future shop
[3324.56 --> 3330.58]  not that long ago i remember you know buying something that the sales rep told us would be
[3330.58 --> 3335.10]  good for gaming when i didn't know anything about computers yet and finding out that it had onboard
[3335.10 --> 3340.42]  graphics like and remember this was back when intel's onboard graphics were not even like good
[3340.42 --> 3345.70]  onboard graphics i still remember going to the future shop in langley back when future shop existed
[3345.70 --> 3351.72]  yeah and trying to find a graphics card with my dad and going through all the different components
[3351.72 --> 3356.10]  that they had there and stuff and like the the old art that used to be on graphics card boxes i know
[3356.10 --> 3362.70]  right and like i know nothing about it my dad luckily knew some stuff so that was great but like i knew
[3362.70 --> 3369.08]  nothing so i was like oh pretty box art i want this one um but yeah i don't know i this is very
[3369.08 --> 3376.40]  confused so the the notes are talking about an amazon article which is like interesting and then
[3376.40 --> 3380.58]  the link for the element mini is to the microsoft store
[3380.58 --> 3391.38]  which seems to have things listed correctly in terms of specs yeah i uh i think that the big problem
[3391.38 --> 3402.00]  is just that this gt 730 is a gt 430 which was garbage when it came out and is definitely garbage today
[3402.00 --> 3410.16]  and obviously doesn't perform very well so the big problem here is calling things gaming when
[3410.16 --> 3418.52]  they are obviously not capable of gaming in any kind of modern sense so that's what's going on here
[3418.52 --> 3423.42]  though like is nvidia calling this card that is is ibuypower just like stickering it like what's
[3423.42 --> 3430.38]  what's happening here i don't fully i feel like i'm missing something am i just being dumb um
[3430.38 --> 3444.12]  yeah i mean it's all stuff so it's all stuff that's bad but none of it is new yeah so that's kind of that's
[3444.12 --> 3450.86]  kind of where i'm at on this okay okay yeah okay and you know honestly at 600 us dollars it's not
[3450.86 --> 3457.38]  exactly a great deal or anything but it's not like you aren't getting you know it's not like that would
[3457.38 --> 3465.24]  cost a ton more than 600 or a ton more than 700 dollars excuse me it's not like it would cost you
[3465.24 --> 3471.54]  my trip is starting to catch up to me a little bit i have not slept enough i am pretty good at
[3471.54 --> 3475.78]  managing jet lag can you talk about that at all can you even say where you were uh i was in tel aviv
[3475.78 --> 3480.14]  okay yeah yeah and we're gonna end it there and we're gonna we're gonna end it right there yeah
[3480.14 --> 3488.24]  um just so people understand why there's jet lag going on so this is a 3600 ryzen 5 that's a 270
[3488.24 --> 3494.50]  dollar canadian processor so what is that like 210 200 around 200 us dollars something like that
[3494.50 --> 3499.62]  uh you know there's some ram there's a case you know there's a power supply so rgb fans as far as
[3499.62 --> 3506.22]  rgb fans like it's it's not like um it's not like a scam in the sense that you think you're buying
[3506.22 --> 3512.68]  a computer and it ships with a brick inside you know like 20 worth of worth of concrete
[3512.68 --> 3518.86]  or like you know cement inside it like it's not like that but it's just a really really terrible
[3518.86 --> 3525.78]  deal which again is nothing new in the pre-built computer yeah and i guess the the whole like this
[3525.78 --> 3532.08]  is still this old graphics card thing is not new either but bringing light to it's probably pretty
[3532.08 --> 3537.56]  chill yeah and and that shouldn't be a thing rebranding products shouldn't be a thing that's
[3537.56 --> 3543.84]  something we've spoken out about in the past because the only reason to do it is to mislead
[3543.84 --> 3550.60]  users to make them think that it's something newer than what it is that's literally the only reason to
[3550.60 --> 3556.80]  do it so we've criticized rebadging graphics cards in particular seem to go through this a lot oh and
[3556.80 --> 3560.98]  they've been going through it for the entire time that i've been interested in computers as well
[3560.98 --> 3567.28]  yeah more or less like like it's this is not even close to new i still remember getting absolutely
[3567.28 --> 3575.34]  like enraged at sapphire way back in the day because there was like a a variant of i actually
[3575.34 --> 3582.16]  wow i actually finally forget the details of it i guess time does heal all wounds
[3582.16 --> 3590.66]  it was some variant of like a 9600 or something like that that had a cut down memory bus
[3590.66 --> 3596.48]  because that was the big one back in the day was they would they would have the memory bus
[3596.48 --> 3602.10]  which would dramatically change the performance because you are essentially
[3602.10 --> 3609.24]  cutting the memory bandwidth in half and that's not something that was typically disclosed on a spec
[3609.24 --> 3614.78]  sheet so i bought just so that in my parents machine there would be something like sort of usable
[3614.78 --> 3620.80]  for my siblings i bought what i thought was a decent gpu but it was you know 15 20 cheaper
[3620.80 --> 3624.90]  and i put it in there and i was like this performance is trash what the heck is going on
[3624.90 --> 3629.32]  here this should be better because i had like the real version in my own machine like a year prior or
[3629.32 --> 3636.30]  something like that and i found out that it was only disclosed and that was the only way i was able
[3636.30 --> 3641.40]  to figure it out because i maybe i didn't have access to tools like gpu z yet or something but it was
[3641.40 --> 3647.60]  only disclosed on like their european site that it was a 64-bit bus card when it was supposed to be a
[3647.60 --> 3653.80]  128 bit like it was not listed on ati at the time it wasn't listed on ati's website anywhere as
[3653.80 --> 3660.62]  that that was a variant of this gpu that existed so i made the argument to them that i should be able
[3660.62 --> 3664.92]  to get a refund or that they should swap it for one with a 128 bit bus because the retailer didn't
[3664.92 --> 3671.04]  list it properly ncix um their product information didn't have it on their north american site where i had
[3671.04 --> 3677.66]  you know gone to double check um so i had no way of knowing that i was buying some some garbage card
[3677.66 --> 3685.96]  um and so that's all terrible rebadging things quietly changing the specs without changing the label
[3685.96 --> 3692.62]  those are both bad even though they're kind of the opposite behavior uh they're just they're super duper
[3692.62 --> 3699.50]  nothing new and for as long as the tech industry has and will exist it's going to continue to be a thing
[3699.50 --> 3708.44]  probably yep yep so there you go all right should we move on to our next topic yeah but um shame on
[3708.44 --> 3718.48]  you amazon reseller and uh microsoft and nzxt2 for having the word gaming in the description of that
[3718.48 --> 3725.40]  desktop i'll say that much honestly you'd probably be better off just getting the apu version of that
[3725.40 --> 3732.68]  chip and running on the onboard yeah gaming desktop yeah that's just yeah i feel like they're almost
[3732.68 --> 3738.98]  just saying that because like some marketing person was like well it has the rgbs yeah maybe we should
[3738.98 --> 3749.02]  call it the gamings uh next topic though devon s i think just bought one of everything on the entire
[3749.02 --> 3756.04]  site a mystery water bottle a short circuit long sleeve a tech scarf a dad hat three mystery t-shirts
[3756.04 --> 3762.22]  one ethernet shirt a mean face sequin pillow a banana scale in every color a do not drop t-shirt
[3762.22 --> 3768.58]  and other cpu pillow did i already say cpu pillow no a cpu pillow a party shirt did i already say party
[3768.58 --> 3776.16]  shirt i can't even keep track and a water bottle wow unbelievable um okay talk about talk about doing
[3776.16 --> 3780.46]  some black friday shopping i mean we only offered a 15 discount and it's only on one item you don't
[3780.46 --> 3788.64]  have to buy everything i mean you can um but you don't have to microsoft and qualcomm so in the past
[3788.64 --> 3793.62]  few weeks mediatek has been expressing interest in building their own arm chips that can run windows
[3793.62 --> 3802.92]  turns out there's a snag and xda as xda developers reported uh the reason that we've only seen qualcomm
[3802.92 --> 3810.80]  windows pcs is because microsoft and qualcomm have an exclusivity deal the sources say it is set to
[3810.80 --> 3817.30]  expire soon with no known date but that would explain why we've only seen qualcomm powered devices
[3817.30 --> 3824.44]  since they were first announced by the two companies in 2016 maybe a five-year agreement let's hope the
[3824.44 --> 3828.96]  end of this agreement could mean windows arm licensing could be opened up to a lot more chips including
[3828.96 --> 3834.60]  potentially apple silicon that was something that was extremely disappointing to me about the apple
[3834.60 --> 3841.62]  silicon max was that if you wanted to run windows even though microsoft had an arm version you couldn't
[3841.62 --> 3848.32]  do it yeah unless you wanted to you know actually is there a way to do it through like emulation
[3848.32 --> 3854.00]  i don't know does parallels have a solution for that you guys will have to let me know in the chat i
[3854.00 --> 3861.36]  don't daily drive uh a mac so there hasn't been any reason for me to solve this problem um wow that's
[3861.36 --> 3870.90]  that's a real drag and a half i mean i guess i kind of get it because if i was microsoft and i
[3870.90 --> 3878.18]  desperately needed some kind of silicon apparently snazzy labs has done it yeah there you go um yes you can
[3878.18 --> 3884.84]  parallels it if i was desperate for there to be some kind of silicon for me to even you know continue
[3884.84 --> 3893.32]  to develop my windows arm software on to have any you know reason for it to exist at all then i might
[3893.32 --> 3901.60]  make a deal like that so that kind of makes sense yeah apparently parallels with windows for arm is
[3901.60 --> 3912.74]  fantastic okay good to know so i don't man see the problem with arm windows for me
[3912.74 --> 3923.22]  is it's just one of those like why things yeah like if i if i the only reason that i daily drive windows
[3923.22 --> 3930.78]  aside from familiarity which honestly is not that big of a deal like i i do such basic things outside of
[3930.78 --> 3935.48]  my web browser now anyway that it kind of doesn't matter so the only reason for me to daily drive
[3935.48 --> 3944.36]  windows is gaming and if i was going to game arm is clearly not a reasonable option yeah and if i was
[3944.36 --> 3949.68]  not going to game then i think based on everything we learned from the linux challenge i would probably
[3949.68 --> 3957.24]  just i mean i was perfectly happy with manjaro kde other than gaming you're spoiling the next episode
[3957.24 --> 3963.30]  a little bit oh well i guess a little bit but uh i don't know maybe it's not that bad to spoil it a
[3963.30 --> 3968.54]  little bit since people are so outraged about the uh the streaming episode people are a little cheesed
[3968.54 --> 3973.40]  about that one a little cheese the next episode is can i say what it is i guess yeah yeah go for it the
[3973.40 --> 3981.14]  next episode is like random productivity tasks yeah so non-gaming tasks that you do there's a 12 page
[3981.14 --> 3987.56]  thread on the forum about the second episode and i i i replied to it at one point i was like
[3987.56 --> 3993.76]  people keep saying that the problems that i had are related to my exotic hardware other than my go xlr
[3993.76 --> 4000.20]  what about my hardware is exotic go xlr isn't exotic either that has caused any problems i'll wait
[4000.20 --> 4006.54]  and people launched into these explanations of how my hardware is exotic but where they never managed to
[4006.54 --> 4014.62]  get to was how it caused any of the problems that i actually had yeah and to be clear um the the elgato
[4014.62 --> 4020.54]  lights for example i never presented that as a problem because my workaround for it was very easy
[4020.54 --> 4026.20]  i didn't have to solve anything i just used my phone um most of my problems like in my raw doc did
[4026.20 --> 4031.18]  have you share that raw doc with you no actually that's just my like i haven't technically yeah my
[4031.18 --> 4036.44]  thoughts doc well we weren't supposed to see each other right we both have one right yeah the vast
[4036.44 --> 4044.48]  majority of my of my issues in my doc have nothing to do with that i'm running a thread ripper and
[4044.48 --> 4050.14]  therefore the people who develop linux you know they're just using their own hardware and they
[4050.14 --> 4055.58]  wouldn't necessarily be able to test on that do you grow your own cpu linus i never i never i never
[4055.58 --> 4061.28]  said they did i never said anything about any of that i never things have not i never said it had any
[4061.28 --> 4066.70]  stability problems i the problems were just that everything's a chore i've been kind of following
[4066.70 --> 4072.06]  along on the i have never mentioned that i've even known this existed but i guess people probably knew
[4072.06 --> 4078.74]  i've been following along on the mint forums oh i see yeah because my my brain went to average user
[4078.74 --> 4083.88]  right so i was like because especially at the beginning yeah but throughout the whole thing we
[4083.88 --> 4089.58]  weren't allowed to like ask for help etc yeah so if i had a problem one of my things was like well i don't
[4089.58 --> 4093.96]  know i'd probably go back to the thing that i got so i went on mint's website and i was like there's
[4093.96 --> 4098.18]  a forum this all seems like things that i would maybe do so i went to the forum i started poking
[4098.18 --> 4104.18]  around and then i started noticing after we posted one video that there was a thread about the video
[4104.18 --> 4108.06]  on the mint forums and i was like oh i'm gonna see what people are saying they've actually been
[4108.06 --> 4115.06]  decently nice r slash linux has been surprisingly there's both sides for sure but yeah they've been
[4115.06 --> 4122.54]  but anything that manages to get any kind of upvote momentum has been mostly like yeah we understand
[4122.54 --> 4128.70]  the spirit of where this is coming from and there's also i'm seeing a bit of a a tide turn
[4128.70 --> 4135.74]  in some of the sentiment anyway where people are saying hey you know all of the problematic things
[4135.74 --> 4143.08]  that you might find about this aside this has already generated discussion and improvements
[4143.08 --> 4152.82]  to the experience so for better or for worse linus and luke were 100 successful hey in what they were
[4152.82 --> 4160.02]  trying to do got him which was to go in as people who have not tried to daily drive linux for gaming
[4160.02 --> 4168.44]  and talk about the experience yeah generate discussion and hopefully turn that into something
[4168.44 --> 4173.94]  that will become better in the future if it isn't already good now and which it isn't i mean
[4173.94 --> 4183.02]  i mentioned a while ago that i pivoted my work laptop yep um i i pivoted it to i'll finally say it now
[4183.02 --> 4189.28]  i left it vague last time i went to ubuntu oh okay because i was like you know what i said i didn't
[4189.28 --> 4195.76]  want to use try the vanilla because try vanilla you know it's a good flavor it is a good i i uh i
[4195.76 --> 4200.68]  said that i didn't want to use it because i don't like gnome 3 yeah but i had never used gnome 3 you
[4200.68 --> 4207.02]  hater what a hater so but exactly so i was like i'm gonna go use it haters gonna hate hate hate
[4207.02 --> 4213.68]  honestly gnome 3 is fine i still think i prefer mint yeah and the cinnamon experience and all that kind
[4213.68 --> 4219.06]  of stuff sure so i'm probably gonna pivot my laptop again but like it it's been completely fine
[4219.06 --> 4224.90]  i'm just a creature of habit and there was nothing about kde that super offended me so yeah if i was
[4224.90 --> 4229.70]  gonna go linux again the number of people that are like and all your problems because you chose arch
[4230.26 --> 4235.14]  well like hold on a second the amount of criticism i've taken for going with manjaro
[4235.78 --> 4243.54]  is kind of mind-blowing especially because manjaro has not really caused any of my problems no i mean
[4243.54 --> 4250.90]  they saw some of my early struggles figuring out that apt was not a thing on manjaro which which i
[4250.90 --> 4258.58]  just didn't know because every guide you find for anything is like apt get whatever so apt good i
[4258.58 --> 4265.22]  i mean once i figured out pamac was a thing um and pac-man was a thing i was like this is great i've got
[4265.22 --> 4272.42]  my graphical version and i've got my command line terminal version and so i will just do this from
[4272.42 --> 4280.18]  now on um so these are all things that i figured out but manjaro did not cause any of my problems and
[4280.18 --> 4286.10]  i don't think that it was an entirely unreasonable thing for me to do because the rationale was well
[4286.10 --> 4292.66]  my number one choice didn't work out for reasons that the os maker has admitted were not entirely my
[4292.66 --> 4298.50]  fault um and the upstream has admitted was not entirely my fault fixes have been applied for
[4298.50 --> 4308.66]  what happened to me to me not by me um so my first choice didn't work out my second choice was well i
[4308.66 --> 4318.34]  know that steam os 3.0 is going to be an arch derivative so maybe some of the work that valve is doing
[4318.34 --> 4324.42]  on proton or compatibility seam compatibility layer or whatever they call it maybe that would also be
[4324.42 --> 4331.94]  applicable in some way to an also an archa like so i'm going to try that because it also came highly
[4331.94 --> 4336.74]  recommended those were those were the main things that i was thinking about my number one didn't work
[4336.74 --> 4344.82]  out maybe something arch based would be a better bet in some way because i and that's another thing too
[4344.82 --> 4350.82]  is like what's supported so i had already i had already gone for the ubuntu based and it was a big
[4350.82 --> 4357.86]  problem for me so i was like well the other main sort of thing we're at least aware of yeah yeah and the
[4357.86 --> 4364.90]  one that the valve obviously chose for some reason for gaming is arch so i was like i'm not going to try
[4364.90 --> 4372.42]  to tackle arch itself by the way so i'm just going to i'm just going to try this like i'm going to try
[4372.42 --> 4383.54]  arch with training wheels and honestly it was fine so none of my problems were really specific to a
[4383.54 --> 4389.46]  distro in my opinion yes i had problems with dolphin but i would have probably found problems with the
[4389.46 --> 4395.78]  default application choices in any distro and i would have probably found problems with cohesion
[4395.78 --> 4401.14]  in any distro because those are linux desktop problems and i think definitely exist i think
[4401.14 --> 4410.90]  another problem that's going on is is some people in the community i think are ignoring the fact that
[4410.90 --> 4416.10]  we would complain about windows too yeah we brought this up a couple times like we're not going like
[4416.10 --> 4422.34]  windows is perfect therefore these things suck it's just but these things can suck and windows
[4422.34 --> 4430.10]  can suck yes everything can suck everything can be imperfect yeah i mean there are things i hate about
[4430.10 --> 4436.98]  i've actually literally uploaded videos of just lists of things i hate about operating systems uh windows
[4436.98 --> 4445.38]  more recently but um oh man back when we did that series of 10 reasons mac os is just better
[4446.10 --> 4452.66]  and 10 or 10 reasons windows is better yeah the number of people that interpreted mac os being
[4452.66 --> 4458.98]  better to mean that windows is worse or vice versa just because something has something better doesn't
[4458.98 --> 4466.34]  mean that it is better like the point i'm trying to make is things can be good and things can be bad
[4466.34 --> 4471.54]  and that doesn't inherently make the other thing good or the other thing bad it just means that if we're
[4471.54 --> 4477.06]  being objective anything has lots of stuff about it that is crap and lots of stuff about it that is
[4477.06 --> 4484.42]  good and that's okay like luke and i had a super frustrating windows gaming experience last night
[4485.78 --> 4491.62]  where and i don't know who to blame could be microsoft could be valve um could be whoever the
[4491.62 --> 4498.34]  developer is for towerfall i don't know but we were having issues with remote play trying to play towerfall with
[4498.34 --> 4504.66]  my kids locally and luke remotely and we just couldn't get four controllers working properly
[4504.66 --> 4509.22]  without one of them either not working at all or one of them controlling two players at the same time
[4509.22 --> 4516.98]  three or even three and i would say that that's a crap experience that's a crap user experience and
[4516.98 --> 4522.18]  to contrast this just in case you weren't going to go there we played towerfall through remote play
[4522.18 --> 4528.42]  on linux flawlessly and immediately with three players fair which worked perfectly last night too
[4529.22 --> 4532.82]  it was the fourth player that was causing trouble did it work perfectly right away i don't think so
[4532.82 --> 4538.82]  oh i still had okay no the first issue we had was that it seems like i think like yvonne's thunderbolt
[4538.82 --> 4545.06]  doc died or something like yeah so that was unrelated no but i mean even once you had like gone downstairs
[4545.06 --> 4552.74]  i can't remember okay i can't remember i'm not sure so sorry yeah there's there's there's bad there
[4552.74 --> 4563.38]  there's bad experiences everywhere um yeah and i guess the point of the series was can you switch today
[4564.02 --> 4571.46]  as the average gamer and the answer is well the answer is complicated so the answer the answer is
[4571.46 --> 4576.34]  complicated apparently the go xlr for linux project added better installation instructions that's
[4576.34 --> 4583.14]  pretty cool so you know i've seen some criticism that i was too hard on what is obviously a grassroots
[4583.14 --> 4590.90]  community project i mean i i i don't think i hated on them but the experience wasn't very good and for
[4590.90 --> 4596.82]  better or for worse the experience is now better because of what i said apparently the developer agrees
[4596.82 --> 4605.62]  like oh i see your point i guess i could make this better and now it is better so that's why reviewers
[4605.62 --> 4613.86]  exist that's why critics exist so it's not that i'm trying to be a jerk about it i'm just my job going
[4613.86 --> 4618.98]  into this was to evaluate it and that's why we had said on i think it was last week on when show we had
[4618.98 --> 4624.74]  said maybe a cool follow-up would be to go in and experience windows fresh yeah now i just threw my old
[4624.74 --> 4629.30]  drive back in because i just wanted to play some video games and not think about it for a little
[4629.30 --> 4639.94]  bit but i i intend to put a fresh drive in start from scratch and review windows i'd do it too are we
[4639.94 --> 4645.14]  yeah there's the there's the two different version potential as well windows 10 and windows 11 i'm
[4645.14 --> 4650.66]  gonna go windows 11 yeah okay i'm gonna go windows 11 and i'm gonna have the someone warts and all
[4650.66 --> 4656.34]  someone brought up an interesting argument um and there's some generalizations here and i noticed
[4656.34 --> 4661.06]  that when i first read it but so i'm gonna try to quote but it's not in front of me so whatever
[4661.06 --> 4668.90]  but they essentially said no one installs windows that's not true people buy a computer and windows is on
[4668.90 --> 4677.06]  it sure but that's also that's a not true and b doesn't excuse a bad installation experience yeah if
[4677.06 --> 4683.30]  it's a microsoft product which the installation experience is then what's the excuse for it being
[4683.30 --> 4689.06]  bad you're a multi multi tens of billions of dollars company no no i don't accept that okay
[4689.06 --> 4694.50]  that's fair enough yeah no i think the majority of people well definitely the majority of people don't
[4694.50 --> 4698.26]  that's fair it's still part of the process but it's a microsoft product if it's a microsoft product
[4698.26 --> 4704.90]  then it should be polished you're charging me money for it man i paid for it i think such a substantial
[4704.90 --> 4710.98]  part of the windows video is going to be the amount of things you have to click when you're
[4710.98 --> 4716.02]  going through the installation process yeah yeah i could see that it's crazy and there's just there's
[4716.02 --> 4722.98]  just shockingly stupid stuff like you go through this whole process and it's like you install the
[4722.98 --> 4727.06]  whole operating system then you like do all this stuff then you sit and you wait for like four more
[4727.06 --> 4731.38]  minutes well it's like hey we're setting things up setting things up well what were you doing before yeah
[4731.38 --> 4737.30]  yeah yeah what and i actually really like i believe if i remember correctly ubuntu did this
[4737.30 --> 4742.50]  and i know mint did this but you you do the install and then there's just a window that you can close if
[4742.50 --> 4747.30]  you want that's all the customization stuff and windows does all this forced customization stuff while
[4747.30 --> 4753.30]  you're going through the setup and going back to the windows version after installing mint and ubuntu
[4753.30 --> 4760.42]  was so frustrating so if i just wanted to use my damn computer right now like why are you stopping me
[4760.42 --> 4766.74]  so that i can what make it look green like i don't care i can do this whenever yeah this is a low
[4766.74 --> 4773.22]  priority task yeah yeah uh 88 pocket says windows 10 pro needs to drop preloaded crap like candy crush
[4773.22 --> 4784.10]  what professional expects or wants candy crush yes that's so stupid 100 100 oh 100 oh maybe they will
[4784.10 --> 4792.50]  because blizzard is uh microsoft said that they were thinking about re re uh how did they word it
[4793.06 --> 4796.74]  they're gonna look at their relationship with blizzard and like re-establish what they're doing
[4796.74 --> 4801.14]  there because of like bobby codic and all the stuff that's going on does blizzard own king yeah oh i
[4801.14 --> 4805.06]  didn't realize that or our activision i guess yeah whatever blizzard activision yeah or sorry
[4805.06 --> 4813.38]  activation blizzard yeah okay yeah hilarious so hopefully that happens hopefully because that is
[4813.38 --> 4822.42]  so dumb brutal oh or tear tear or tear said on the last stream you had something in your bag you wanted
[4822.42 --> 4831.38]  to show us what's in the bag okay first of all first of all i used uh the ltt backpack prototype for my trip
[4831.38 --> 4841.14]  oh and it's even better than i thought you know how the size is kind of big it fits perfectly under
[4841.14 --> 4846.58]  an airline seat there's also no scuffs which is great oh yeah no i mean the the material choice i
[4846.58 --> 4851.14]  already knew was outstanding i'm just saying because this a lot of bags and stuff the second you go on a
[4851.14 --> 4856.98]  trip yeah tossing around an airplane do all this kind of stuff they get yeah but yeah it looks it looks
[4856.98 --> 4863.22]  brandy looks immaculate yeah actually yeah um the like additional structure of it was great because
[4863.22 --> 4866.90]  it makes it really easy to put really bulky stuff in and out of it because i was like constantly
[4866.90 --> 4872.10]  throwing my because you're on plane right it's like i'm freezing jacket i'm too hot i'm too hot yeah
[4872.98 --> 4877.14]  right so i was constantly putting things in and out of it i had my whole gaming setup while i was there so
[4877.14 --> 4886.82]  i had my my e gpu my laptop my mouse pad my mouse i was like set up man um so i was constantly going in
[4886.82 --> 4891.94]  and out of it it was great uh so that's one of the that's one of the big takeaways for me is we're
[4891.94 --> 4897.62]  actually we were going to change something significant so see this three-way zip pocket on the front yes
[4899.22 --> 4905.06]  on the inside i'm gonna try and show everyone on the inside there's this mesh pocket and i had
[4905.06 --> 4911.06]  concerns about the mesh pocket because when you open it up all the way it's kind of floopsy doodly
[4911.86 --> 4916.34]  and i didn't really like that i thought it was kind of not a great experience because if you have
[4916.34 --> 4921.78]  something heavy in here it just kind of like weighs it down um so i didn't like it so i had said okay
[4921.78 --> 4927.78]  you know what let's do the self is what this is called when it's the same material as the body let's
[4927.78 --> 4932.66]  do the self let's do some pockets here and let's try to discourage people from loading this up with
[4932.66 --> 4938.10]  stuff but what i realized when i was actually using it day to day on my trip was that how i actually use
[4938.10 --> 4943.22]  it is like this i don't open it all the way it's nice to be able to open it all the way if i really need to
[4944.02 --> 4948.82]  but i don't really open it all the way i just use it like this and then it has enough structure and
[4948.82 --> 4952.82]  it was actually really nice to just have a mesh pocket that i could huck everything in and then
[4952.82 --> 4959.06]  if i really need to see what i'm doing i can i can look into it uh we are making some changes in here
[4959.06 --> 4963.22]  so for example the screwdriver sticks up right now so we're gonna have the screwdriver pocket go all the
[4963.22 --> 4967.54]  way down that's one of my big things is i want our products to be compatible with each other makes sense
[4967.54 --> 4972.10]  i remember back when we first started working together one of the gripes that we had all the
[4972.10 --> 4976.34]  time was like case and power supply manufacturers yeah the power supply is not fitting you buy an
[4976.34 --> 4981.70]  antac case and like their flagship case and you buy their flagship power supply and it like doesn't fit
[4981.70 --> 4986.98]  in it like stuff like that yes so we we want to make sure that there's a place to put the screwdriver
[4986.98 --> 4993.30]  so this pocket is going to become only this big and then what i realized again is because of this
[4993.30 --> 5001.86]  this this zip here needs to start on this side so that you can access the zipper more easily and open
[5001.86 --> 5009.14]  it when it's not open all the way so the intention is that this can open but you don't have to um
[5009.14 --> 5015.54]  that makes sense we're also reconfiguring the slips on the inside so we've got three slips like three
[5015.54 --> 5021.70]  slips for devices we've got a laptop pouch a tablet pouch and then one that's intended for more like a
[5021.70 --> 5028.98]  nintendo switch or like a steam deck or something like that and the problem is that we did two slips
[5028.98 --> 5034.02]  on this side and one slip at the bottom on this side and what happens is when you've got heavy stuff
[5034.02 --> 5041.06]  up here it weighs down the top so that that slip kind of sticks out and it's almost impossible to get
[5041.06 --> 5045.38]  down into the bottom of the pocket without like kind of making your way in there so we're going to do
[5045.38 --> 5051.86]  the three slips on the back now assuming we can sew through that much material like there's just so
[5051.86 --> 5058.26]  many little things that i kind of like learned about it yeah overall it's really close um it's going to
[5058.26 --> 5064.98]  be really expensive but i can it's the best bag i've ever had and i can pretty much promise that unless you've
[5064.98 --> 5071.86]  i don't know i i haven't encountered something that's better like from a tech standpoint so
[5073.06 --> 5080.18]  i i doubt that you've owned a better bag basically what's that um oh this
[5081.62 --> 5089.06]  uh oh i actually meant that that's on your like hip oh i'll talk about that later okay um so this is
[5089.06 --> 5095.22]  the thing that i was gonna that i was gonna pull out of my bag um the i mean the steam deck is not
[5095.22 --> 5102.98]  the only handheld gaming pc and aya they did send me that clear one when they initially launched but
[5104.18 --> 5110.26]  that neo doesn't have some of the improvements of their new one and i was like oh um wow that's
[5110.26 --> 5115.06]  super cool when they kind of sent me this this update thing and they were like oh yeah well we'll
[5115.06 --> 5118.42]  send you one if you want i was like okay well i mean i didn't wasn't asking for anything but
[5118.42 --> 5124.82]  um you know what i'd really like actually is the new some of the new features on my old one like
[5124.82 --> 5128.74]  if you could just send me those parts i'd be happy to upgrade it myself because i really like the clear
[5128.74 --> 5134.98]  housing and they were like well it's not that simple um so we'd rather just send you a new one
[5134.98 --> 5142.34]  by the way we have this color that looks so cool they did a retro colorway oh my goodness with like
[5142.34 --> 5153.70]  red gray almost black um army drab green yeah so it's like a retro console kind of color scheme
[5153.70 --> 5158.90]  so this has got all the new improvements so it now has analog triggers and i think there were a couple
[5158.90 --> 5165.54]  of other little things that they tweaked but i am like super stoked on this sweet i love i absolutely
[5165.54 --> 5173.94]  love the colors yeah it's like ugly in in all the right ways yeah 100 so uh i forget what else they
[5173.94 --> 5181.38]  changed about it but um so i'll definitely be using that until the steam deck arrives and who knows maybe
[5181.38 --> 5186.42]  after i don't know i still haven't daily driven a steam deck i don't know if the ergonomics that seemed
[5186.42 --> 5193.22]  good in my first hands-on are gonna stay good i'm hoping i'm hoping it will because the performance of the
[5193.22 --> 5198.18]  steam deck looks like freaking awesome uh what's conrad talking about they talked about that in
[5198.18 --> 5203.14]  a previous one show i don't remember right now okay i don't know yeah it looks freaking cool penmail
[5203.14 --> 5209.06]  says love that sand color yeah it looks awesome it looks freaking cool and the texture is like really
[5209.06 --> 5214.58]  great uh what is that again question mark question mark question mark it's the a in neo i don't even
[5214.58 --> 5221.78]  know if they have any stock i doubt it it's like ridiculously hard to get your hands on like any good tech
[5221.78 --> 5232.26]  right now um let's see if they even have any stock oh i don't see this color wait i don't know if it's
[5232.26 --> 5241.46]  like a special one for influencers or something again i don't see it on their site a neo retro oh no
[5241.46 --> 5253.54]  uh oh a neo 2021 pro oh wow so it has a docking station what is dark star oh light moon i think is
[5253.54 --> 5260.98]  the one that i've got yeah this is light moon verizon 7 4800u one terabyte ssd i actually don't know the
[5260.98 --> 5269.94]  difference between the pro and um the other one this is maybe something to for me to just make a full video
[5269.94 --> 5278.74]  about because clearly i have not done any research uh maybe it's the 4500u in the in the main one
[5278.74 --> 5287.86]  people are like put steam os 3.0 on it that would actually be super cool like the not the not steam
[5287.86 --> 5296.50]  deck steam deck yeah yeah that'd be amazing it's interesting 16 gigs up to two terabytes okay so maybe
[5296.50 --> 5305.06]  that's it maybe it's just uh just better specs here all right cool um right what else was i going
[5305.06 --> 5309.06]  to talk about i mean i think that's i think that's pretty much it maybe we should talk some some merch
[5309.06 --> 5316.98]  messages here real quick sure yeah let's do it uh we have been organizing them so you guys might have
[5316.98 --> 5324.26]  noticed a lot of them have been have been popping up uh popping up there but some of them haven't so if you
[5324.26 --> 5329.86]  sent one and you were like uh what the heck happened it's possible it ended up in our curated queue
[5329.86 --> 5336.42]  yeah uh naomi l solar powered pool is definitely still going to happen uh johnny s long time watcher
[5336.42 --> 5342.74]  first time buyer any chance on a stealth desk pad yes that was the thing i was gonna go leak okay so i'm
[5342.74 --> 5345.86]  gonna go try and get one do you want to go through a few of these yeah all right
[5352.26 --> 5355.86]  john a uh bought a water bottle a shirt and a spout lid and said
[5357.62 --> 5359.46]  it's it has to do with the message
[5361.70 --> 5367.62]  and then he said uh needed a new water bottle since the yellow on my black and gold v1 completely worn
[5367.62 --> 5373.54]  away yeah it lasts for a while but you know not forever that's part of the reason as far as my
[5373.54 --> 5379.06]  understanding goes i am so sorry if i'm totally wrong about this but i think the new versions have
[5379.06 --> 5386.58]  better printing i don't know i don't know i'm sorry that's not my not my department um moving on
[5386.58 --> 5395.86]  we've got some that we that we already oh these are archived messages that's why that's going on
[5395.86 --> 5399.78]  that makes sense okay sorry guys give me one second
[5408.18 --> 5412.98]  bought a beanie because i heard great things as well as a spout lid for my v1 water bottle
[5412.98 --> 5417.70]  had to get some shirts uh to offset shipping costs there you go i'm assuming it was shipped
[5417.70 --> 5424.58]  far away uh casu says i needed a beanie for the winter and an amazing water bottle and a
[5425.22 --> 5433.14]  and well a shirt greetings from germany ps wanted to link linus uh some de-isolation tool he should get
[5433.14 --> 5442.58]  the strip backs from what the i can't say that uh weed mueller i'm going to copy that and i'll
[5442.58 --> 5448.50]  show it to him later couldn't find the backpack uh it's yeah it's not a thing anymore so i had to
[5448.50 --> 5454.34]  improvise first time buying and already hating the taxes i'll have to pay this is a lot of things he got
[5454.34 --> 5461.70]  like uh everything gpu t-shirt ethernet t-shirt reflective cpu t-shirt insulated water bottle
[5461.70 --> 5467.22]  reflective heatsink t-shirt party shirt insulated water bottle northern lights desk pad another northern
[5467.22 --> 5474.82]  lights desk had cpu pillow and an abc's book of gaming g-burst um hey finally got around to
[5474.82 --> 5480.26]  ordering one of these bad boys by the way uh how would you say the name throne oh i think i did that
[5480.26 --> 5486.82]  one oh yeah i can't tell where i tried throney you tried throney isn't it throne i don't know i have no
[5486.82 --> 5498.50]  idea so this oh is an upcoming stealth circuit board uh desk pad design so if you guys look kind of is it
[5498.50 --> 5506.82]  yeah no here do you want to take a side there we go ah so if you guys look closely you can kind of see
[5507.54 --> 5514.34]  i hope you can see in the as it reflects there's like an ltt logo in the middle and then like a
[5514.34 --> 5518.10]  circuit board in person you can definitely see it oh yeah i don't know how it's showing up on stream but
[5518.10 --> 5522.82]  you can yeah it's really hard to it's subtle but you can definitely see it yeah so it's uh
[5523.46 --> 5530.02]  yeah it's just meant to be kind of a more not so in your face has to match the color of your
[5530.58 --> 5539.30]  of your setup kind of thing um that's definitely coming uh borian says i kind of hate it not gonna lie
[5539.30 --> 5545.54]  i mean yeah get a northern lights pad then get a northern lights pad solved so we've got we've got
[5545.54 --> 5551.94]  lots of different kind of stuff that we're working on but you know for us it's actually kind of a big
[5551.94 --> 5560.34]  commitment to do a new desk pad and the reason for that is that if we want to support our full size
[5560.34 --> 5569.30]  um that's a lot of choice yeah we kind of have to be really sure that it's killer are you doing that
[5569.30 --> 5575.38]  are you supporting every size um like i wouldn't think you necessarily have to as long as the lights
[5575.38 --> 5583.14]  covers everything yeah i mean i don't know i'm torn i'm torn i'm i don't know i don't remember what we
[5583.14 --> 5589.30]  did for this so we'll see yeah yeah there's a lot of people that like it uh people like less branding
[5589.30 --> 5594.18]  would be nice so we actually thought of that uh the reason that the branding is on there is because
[5594.18 --> 5598.74]  we wanted kind of something to be ltt stealth about it but that's right where your keyboard goes
[5599.70 --> 5606.18]  so you will actually never see the ltt logo and the other thing that's cool is that the circuit stuff
[5606.18 --> 5610.18]  if you want to hold it again for a second the circuit stuff kind of radiates out
[5610.18 --> 5621.62]  from your keyboard so this is a very small keyboard so it's like that through like 10 kilos size so the
[5621.62 --> 5627.06]  idea is that it's kind of like your keyboard is the centerpiece of your setup with it that was that was
[5627.06 --> 5632.42]  the rationale behind why we did it that way because you will never have this anywhere where there will
[5632.42 --> 5639.54]  not be a keyboard uh someone says i have keyboard top left i mean that's good um you might want a
[5639.54 --> 5647.62]  different desk pad if you want to cover cover the logo the vast majority of people do not so uh it
[5647.62 --> 5653.46]  should be okay for most people uh there's only there's only so much we can do i mean maybe you
[5653.46 --> 5658.74]  have your keyboard glued under your desk for all i know maybe that's more ergonomic for you there's
[5658.74 --> 5663.70]  nothing i can do for you but um that was that was the rationale that was why we did that
[5663.70 --> 5671.22]  um iceberg says i like this much better but is there any chance of an even more stealth one i
[5671.22 --> 5677.14]  want the nice material but i just want plain black i mean you just want us to make like a plain black
[5677.14 --> 5681.46]  disk pad there's like a hundred plain i mean i guess you know what we did actually you know we did a
[5681.46 --> 5688.82]  custom thickness right like for all of them yeah yes yeah yeah yeah um because i was just like
[5688.82 --> 5698.26]  like no three millimeters is too thin and four millimeters is too thick so the factory was just
[5698.26 --> 5706.10]  like what and the best part is this before is this before we had placed any kind of volume orders with
[5706.10 --> 5712.26]  them so this is before we've like actually paid them like any meaningful amount of money they're just
[5712.26 --> 5719.38]  like okay but everything else is fine like yeah okay then you guys need to place your order and once
[5719.38 --> 5725.78]  you like place your order and put down a big deposit we will do a custom thickness of rubber for you
[5728.02 --> 5736.66]  that's pretty epic oh no yeah all right um are you at the curated merch messages because i think
[5736.66 --> 5741.22]  before you left you're reading from the wrong section uh i'm at the bottom of the curated merch messages
[5741.22 --> 5745.78]  okay so i'm reading from the bottom to the top okay yeah uh brighton says my water bottle with a
[5745.78 --> 5753.86]  gold smear across it i like it that way oh okay um i'm curious to know who my water bottle came with
[5753.86 --> 5757.62]  a gold smear across it i like it that way it takes the stress out of accidentally dinging it but i'm
[5757.62 --> 5764.98]  curious to know who um you can contact support they will get you sorted out um overall the quality
[5764.98 --> 5770.82]  control on the water bottles is excellent we get very very few uh complaints about that so that
[5770.82 --> 5775.78]  seems like a really odd one but nothing's perfect uh jim says can we ever expect a stealth mouse oh
[5776.34 --> 5781.46]  for crying out loud uh anonymous it would be really cool if the backpack had a waterproof pocket for the
[5781.46 --> 5787.86]  uh to prevent any leaks from getting to the expensive things inside so nothing is waterproof but
[5787.86 --> 5794.58]  the self material is fairly water resistant and we're using all water um like all sealed zippers on it
[5794.58 --> 5800.50]  so ykk uh water resistant zippers if i could add some interpretation i think he means from your own things
[5800.82 --> 5806.50]  so like a water bottle leaking it would be cool if the outside so no no it's oh wait i had a
[5806.50 --> 5811.70]  waterproof pocket for the backpack to prevent any leaks from getting oh uh you should just get an
[5811.70 --> 5818.10]  ltt store water bottle so your water bottle doesn't leak hey hey hey i didn't even show this on this
[5818.10 --> 5824.02]  stream anyway but it has a dedicated spot for your water bottle to sit so at the very least if your water
[5824.02 --> 5829.78]  bottle does leak um it shouldn't like fall over and get on anything because it shouldn't ever fall
[5829.78 --> 5839.94]  over sweet so that's cool uh also why is hdr over tv apps in float plane i have huh sorry also why is hdr
[5842.66 --> 5849.38]  oh like in terms of priority because tv apps are just a low priority because casting is a thing
[5849.38 --> 5858.02]  uh linus needs to do a vader impression say luke i am your father which you now cannot do because
[5858.02 --> 5868.34]  that's not the quote what it's no i am your father yeah that's true actually um i'm so sorry jb
[5869.22 --> 5876.42]  happy birthday though yeah happy birthday uh eric hey wanshow long time viewer this is our special place
[5876.42 --> 5883.30]  where one may find audio products that have reached eol or am i just sol looking for a set of uh one
[5883.30 --> 5890.58]  plus bullets wireless z and sony wh h910 ends ebay ebay is the answer and if you don't find it there
[5890.58 --> 5898.26]  honestly i wouldn't ebay and then buy new things foam pads or yeah ear inserts or whatever i mean not
[5898.26 --> 5904.42]  for those the bullets wireless are like in-ears but yeah wouldn't they have little things though you
[5904.42 --> 5911.94]  can buy the gel end whatever it's called uh oh yes i doubt that's the problem though um do you think
[5911.94 --> 5916.10]  the upcoming steam os and steam deck release will push nvidia to finally give a thought to linux support
[5916.10 --> 5923.86]  no i don't think that nvidia works that hard at capturing that uh that game console business so
[5924.74 --> 5929.54]  maybe they just will continue to not care nvidia however has been doing more
[5929.54 --> 5936.74]  more recently i have no idea what the timeline is uh than they have in the more distant past for linux
[5936.74 --> 5943.46]  stuff i believe that's fair but i don't think the steam deck is gonna change anything about it nope
[5943.46 --> 5952.18]  don't think so especially because it's a steam deck you know this is funny um they're talking about the
[5952.18 --> 5962.98]  original lan hoodie in the floatplane chat uh yes you are correct the og form of the ltt hoodie is
[5962.98 --> 5971.22]  actually this one if you get far enough back it's by g8 and it was the lan hoodie and this was the
[5971.22 --> 5978.74]  garment that was the basis for the wan version of it so there's the green inner hood we did an orange
[5978.74 --> 5983.94]  inner hood there's the nvidia logo with the splashy kind of design we did a wan logo with kind of a
[5983.94 --> 5988.34]  splashy design and we were we were up front about that just to be clear we talked about it all the
[5988.34 --> 5995.14]  time yeah we talked about how the reason the wan hoodie existed was because i got a lan hoodie at an
[5995.14 --> 6003.14]  nvidia event and i really liked it and it was like wearing out and so i wanted more and nvidia didn't have
[6003.14 --> 6010.10]  any more left when i asked for one and so i was like okay so what does it take to get more of these garments
[6011.30 --> 6017.94]  and what it took was a minimum order of however many hundreds of them so i did and i sold the rest
[6020.02 --> 6026.42]  awesome yeah literally how we got into doing custom merch was because i wanted a hoodie
[6026.42 --> 6035.86]  a hoodie oh no pretty awesome um nox says when hoodie v1 with the gloves i want one yes i know
[6035.86 --> 6042.02]  they're like 120 still we don't have any more and we have no meaningful way to make them
[6042.82 --> 6048.66]  uh scott says if i'm eligible for a job with an offer master's degree should i say i am legally
[6048.66 --> 6055.86]  eligible on a google form uh yes you should uh seth have you considered making a question though yeah
[6055.86 --> 6059.94]  yeah on the google form oh i'm not sure i don't think that's the question i think the question is
[6059.94 --> 6064.58]  like do you have a valid work permit or something yeah so no is the answer no the the answer is
[6064.58 --> 6071.70]  probably still yes because if you have certain credentials getting that permit is like what what
[6071.70 --> 6078.18]  he's saying is if if it's conditional upon me having a job offer should i say that yes and then the
[6078.18 --> 6083.70]  answer is yes because there are certain visas where you can just go okay if you have a job offer yeah
[6083.70 --> 6090.10]  it's just automatic yeah but if it's not that then don't say you're eligible you yeah yes we are
[6090.10 --> 6095.14]  going to do a display port follow-up on the hdmi cable video absolutely thank you for the suggestion
[6096.58 --> 6103.86]  ryan asks should i wait for ryzen 6000 or buy the new i5 my 7700k is choking hard you should upgrade
[6103.86 --> 6110.10]  when it's time to upgrade because otherwise you will wait forever and if you upgrade when it's not time
[6110.10 --> 6114.82]  to upgrade then you are wasting money and contributing to additional e-waste so it's all
[6114.82 --> 6119.22]  about you should upgrade when you reach a point where you need to upgrade sounds like you got there
[6119.22 --> 6127.30]  time to upgrade that's the way it is uh steven just found out linus is a biker what bike do you have sv650s
[6127.30 --> 6133.22]  it's a 2003 also fortnite oh fortnite is the best youtube motorcycle channel if you haven't heard of it
[6133.22 --> 6140.42]  something to fortnite okay cool thank you chris s says will floatplane get samsung fold support like
[6140.42 --> 6147.94]  laptop mode or the screen i half folded the screen i half folded and audio play while phone is locked
[6147.94 --> 6157.70]  screen is half folded so here i can show it to you on uh on plex um so basically what it does is it puts
[6157.70 --> 6163.06]  it's it lets you just like sit it on something and then you've got like controls on the bottom and
[6163.06 --> 6167.78]  then it just plays in a window up here so you can just like prop it up i believe that's something that
[6167.78 --> 6172.58]  you can actually force support for in a menu somewhere because i don't think plex supported it natively
[6172.58 --> 6179.22]  either but i haven't actually touched it since i first looked at it uh we are going to get like
[6179.22 --> 6185.70]  background audio and stuff working um something that's something jaden is is working on yeah sorry i don't
[6186.34 --> 6191.62]  i don't remember full screen apps no i don't remember uh yeah i don't know if that's something
[6191.62 --> 6198.82]  that we're specifically planning right now though yeah well it's not jonathan asks i'm visually impaired
[6198.82 --> 6202.74]  and the merch message section of the checkout is a very tiny checkbox could we make it more visible
[6202.74 --> 6208.26]  can we do that is that like a theme limitation right now or is that something we could do i'm
[6208.82 --> 6213.54]  conrad's in the chat so he can probably say okay but i think he's using default things right now but we
[6213.54 --> 6217.46]  might be able to make something okay if there's any way for us to do that that would be super cool
[6218.82 --> 6222.74]  uh nate a few ban shows ago you talked about the importance of having external storage for data
[6222.74 --> 6228.02]  backup would you ever do a vid on how to take used slash old slash ebay parts and make a nas at home
[6228.02 --> 6233.70]  that video is in progress right now colin is working on it so yes yes we are
[6235.70 --> 6240.34]  anonymous asks is there an alternative method to apply for lmg jobs i requested the application package a
[6240.34 --> 6245.70]  week ago and have not received it is this expected uh if you didn't receive it that would seem to
[6245.70 --> 6250.82]  indicate that for whatever reason you were not eligible to apply that's one of the reasons that
[6250.82 --> 6259.86]  we have that questionnaire to get the package because we can't go through 10 000 20 000 applications so we
[6259.86 --> 6268.02]  have filtering surveys in order to help us avoid wasting your time and ours so we're not going to tell you
[6268.02 --> 6275.70]  what the the right answers are but there are not everyone gets an application package because we
[6275.70 --> 6282.34]  we do not have the the hr grunt to go through i also wouldn't necessarily take this as a
[6283.54 --> 6289.78]  confirm that you're not going to get one yet yeah uh not every position has sent out the packages because
[6290.42 --> 6296.10]  we haven't finished taking in applicants for some of the positions so yeah sorry go ratchet 766
[6298.02 --> 6305.70]  uh okay let's go ahead and get rid of that uh go ahead and get rid of that okay emmanuel says i
[6305.70 --> 6309.86]  like to roll the dice i know builds aren't exactly popular these days but i'd love to see more content
[6309.86 --> 6319.62]  on small form factor setups it's tough how are we supposed to do a video on any gaming pc when as we saw
[6319.62 --> 6324.02]  you can't build a gaming pc like it's tough
[6327.30 --> 6334.26]  i i do not envy the the ltt content team right now it that's a hard life and yes emmanuel reilly is
[6334.26 --> 6342.26]  awesome yeah joshua says did you hear the makers uh did you hear canonical excuse me uh man i'm getting
[6342.26 --> 6347.62]  very tired i is now collecting feedback on the linux gaming experience that's really cool that is cool i
[6347.62 --> 6354.34]  did not hear about that yet another positive even if you're upset uh yet another positive impact of
[6354.34 --> 6359.30]  the gaming on linux challenge or maybe they were going to do it anyway but it certainly started a
[6359.30 --> 6365.06]  conversation also float plane theater mode when uh it's coming actually theoretically very soon the
[6365.06 --> 6371.70]  developer working on it uh there was a accident that happened at their house where their main laptop
[6371.70 --> 6378.66]  uh the power cord was had a had a well someone had a bit of a tripping accident over the power cord
[6378.66 --> 6384.42]  and it was a version of a macbook that did not have magsafe it was not it was not them it was someone else
[6384.42 --> 6392.02]  but so that laptop went absolute kaput um they have replaced said device and are back up to speed but there
[6392.02 --> 6396.82]  was a little bit of a hiccup there unfortunately but it's actually like very close um all right and
[6396.82 --> 6399.94]  there's a whole new player coming and it's going to be great and things are going to be cool but
[6400.66 --> 6406.74]  oh man matthew just got my party shirt absolutely love it exclamation mark are there any plans for
[6406.74 --> 6414.26]  more patterns to be honest no uh we did not plan any more patterns because i was a bit of a hater
[6414.26 --> 6423.54]  on the party shirt project i underestimated hugely how big that that launch was going to be
[6423.54 --> 6430.74]  um turns out just because i'm allergic to button up shirts doesn't mean that everyone is so that's
[6430.74 --> 6435.86]  good to know there's a whole wide world of people with preferences that are not mine um which is great
[6436.66 --> 6442.58]  so i i i initially oh i mean i barely greenlit the project at all to be honest with you
[6443.46 --> 6448.10]  the finished garment is so much better than the early samples that we had that i based that decision
[6448.10 --> 6454.10]  on like it's super comfortable have you tried it on no okay it's like a really you know don't really
[6454.10 --> 6458.18]  do the whole fair enough yeah it's a really nice fabric though if you absolutely have to wear a
[6458.18 --> 6466.66]  button-up shirt i can understand why people are buying it um but yeah so the fact that it barely got
[6466.66 --> 6471.94]  greenlit at all would indicate that no the plan was not for more patterns now that it is so successful
[6471.94 --> 6480.02]  it um it's not unlikely that we would do more patterns it's it's honestly just not something
[6480.02 --> 6484.90]  we've talked about at all though so no promises thanks for being awesome linus love the show hope
[6484.90 --> 6491.94]  i get these bottles in time for christmas tall shirts when luke uh can you tell us something interesting
[6493.06 --> 6497.30]  wow really you're you can think about that while i discuss tall shirts because they're really putting
[6497.30 --> 6505.86]  you on the spot here uh tall shirts are coming so we actually just did a uh an early print on one of
[6505.86 --> 6511.54]  our first blank hoodies so we have had a heck of a time finding a hoodie that we were happy with that's
[6511.54 --> 6517.54]  just blank that we can just print graphics on the front so no no zip no like uh does it have kangaroo
[6517.54 --> 6526.50]  pockets i don't think no no kangaroo pocket um so we finally have those we also have our blank shirts
[6526.50 --> 6531.86]  so you're going to see a colored t-shirt from ltt store for the first time in like two years or
[6531.86 --> 6537.22]  something like that we're really excited about it but we want to see some of those shirts go out into
[6537.22 --> 6543.62]  the wild make sure that they're holding up make sure the qc is acceptable and make sure that like not
[6543.62 --> 6549.38]  just the q the initial qc but the quality of the ones that are out in the wild are good when we get that
[6549.38 --> 6556.34]  back it'll be time like that information back it'll be time for us to work on our we're going to call
[6556.34 --> 6565.06]  it lanky boy um thick boy um and then we're going to have describing things in those terms for female
[6565.06 --> 6571.70]  clothing probably isn't very 2021 right um i mean maybe maybe we'll just do it anyway lanky girl thick
[6571.70 --> 6578.58]  girl i don't know i mean if we're i don't know what is what is equal i don't know i don't know i don't
[6578.58 --> 6583.62]  know i don't make the rules for any of this so i just figure out what they are and then do my best to
[6583.62 --> 6590.42]  you know would curvy be better i genuinely have no idea i have no idea i have no i just have no
[6590.42 --> 6596.26]  idea to offboard off of that and go back to the previous comment yeah interesting fact uh a notable
[6596.26 --> 6603.70]  predator of the moose if you've if you've heard of moose before they're they're gigantic um and they
[6603.70 --> 6611.30]  walk on land a notable predator of the moose is a killer whale huh okay thank you that's a weird fact
[6611.30 --> 6617.06]  yeah it really is yeah uh robert h bought one of everything i've been watching uh glad to be able
[6617.06 --> 6620.90]  to contribute to you guys how big is the lmg team now i think we're up to somewhere in the neighborhood
[6620.90 --> 6631.38]  of 50 to 55 across just lmg i don't know anymore i'm so sorry i think no i think we're over 60
[6631.38 --> 6636.58]  because i think that doesn't include floatplane oh yeah does that include credit warehouse uh
[6637.22 --> 6645.06]  include i'm sorry i just have no idea yeah no worries um yeah so it's at the point now where
[6645.06 --> 6648.66]  even with my team people are like how many people do you have and i'm like uh
[6650.10 --> 6654.90]  well you don't see them every day either that's true so many of them are remote yeah let me put it this
[6654.90 --> 6664.18]  way lab one is not the only acquisition we made oh my yeah we're taking possession oh also by the
[6664.18 --> 6671.38]  way i um glossed over that is to say glossed over some details which is to say that i outright lied
[6671.38 --> 6677.86]  about some of the aspects of the lab one introduction video like i said that luke would be working in that
[6677.86 --> 6686.42]  room that was never actually my intention um luke might but float planes office would probably be in
[6686.42 --> 6692.42]  the other acquisition which will probably end up with some lab space in it as well i just wanted
[6692.42 --> 6698.58]  for the sake of it made a lot more sense for the flow of the video for the flow of the video i was like
[6698.58 --> 6703.94]  so he's gonna go here but the main reason to talk about luke was to talk about how we understand that
[6703.94 --> 6710.58]  software and development is going to be a big aspect of running this lab not because literally
[6710.58 --> 6715.14]  the float plane team was going to be sitting in that room even though we like memed on the walls
[6715.14 --> 6721.06]  and stuff yeah because the float plane team those that are local are i mean okay we've got our app
[6721.06 --> 6727.22]  developer who would not have anything to do with labs nope uh we've got luke who's managing it like it's
[6729.30 --> 6733.38]  putting float plane there would be just taking up lab space that we could use for more lab equipment
[6733.94 --> 6737.54]  want to say what you might actually put there because that's somewhat interesting yeah so what
[6737.54 --> 6745.38]  i'm actually planning to put there is a small like home theater lab so somewhere that we could use as
[6745.38 --> 6750.42]  a light controlled environment for testing projectors uh somewhere that we could use as a sound control
[6750.42 --> 6758.18]  somewhat controlled not controlled but like sound treated environment for um evaluating sound bars so
[6758.18 --> 6762.18]  we'd have to figure out okay we're going to put some we're going to stuff some insulation up into the t-bar like
[6762.18 --> 6768.66]  uh figuring out a way to kind of turn it into a a basic home theater um so we can look at things
[6768.66 --> 6774.10]  like um you know virtual ceiling speakers and stuff like that so get like a microphone array that's what
[6774.10 --> 6784.58]  i'm actually planning to put there um so yeah and the reason lab one is called lab one is because it's one
[6784.58 --> 6793.78]  uh whoa hold on a second also 10k with this cash flow seems like pennies 10k is not pennies what is
[6793.78 --> 6801.14]  the context of this oh someone wants to invest uh ten thousand dollars into lmg is that an option so we
[6801.14 --> 6810.58]  are not taking any outside investment at this time and the reason is that i just um i like to do things my way
[6810.58 --> 6817.62]  way which sometimes involves spending inordinate amounts of money on things that don't really have
[6817.62 --> 6822.50]  a proven business case we don't have a proven business case for ltt labs if we had a board of
[6822.50 --> 6828.58]  directors that was anyone other than me and yvonne where you know yvonne and i have this vibe right like
[6829.14 --> 6836.26]  she i have i have the vision and sometimes the vision is literally like a vision like i wake up in
[6836.26 --> 6841.94]  the middle of the night i'm like oh i gotta write this down like i'll just like have an idea um and
[6841.94 --> 6849.62]  then she makes the vision happen we've got we've got both parts of the puzzle and that is the that is
[6849.62 --> 6856.18]  the entire ownership structure of linus media group i've always kind of seen it as like there's the there's
[6856.18 --> 6862.50]  the rocket thruster but if you just take that you don't put any wings on it or any flight control
[6862.50 --> 6869.22]  it's not gonna work that great but if you if you if you control it name it properly then it's
[6869.22 --> 6873.46]  fantastic it's powerful and you kind of you kind of need both because all that power with yeah yeah
[6873.46 --> 6880.18]  anyways yeah i um that's so funny oh you don't want stock you just want to like help fund and
[6880.18 --> 6887.14]  encourage the shenanigans you know what i believe firmly that we should always give something back
[6887.14 --> 6895.86]  anytime you anytime you give us money so you should absolutely like buy merch yeah um but i'm not
[6895.86 --> 6901.22]  gonna i'm not gonna just take your money i can't do that so that that's where i'm at on that and if
[6901.22 --> 6906.34]  you want to do something big like that just like sub to float plane at the 4k tier buy more stuff from
[6906.34 --> 6911.70]  merch later if you want a different t-shirt or if we release socks or the backpack or whatever and just
[6911.70 --> 6918.10]  like stay stay in the loop pj lee says can't things be structured so that the shares are non-voting
[6918.10 --> 6923.54]  sure but then what's in it for you why are you investing and the answer can't just be because
[6923.54 --> 6928.50]  you want to be a bro and like help me out or whatever because that's the way i think about
[6928.50 --> 6934.90]  every business transaction is that i have to consider it from both sides because unless i can
[6934.90 --> 6942.10]  figure out what's in it for you it shouldn't happen if i because either it's a bad deal for you and that
[6942.10 --> 6949.06]  sucks so we're not going to do that or i don't understand your deal yeah in which case i feel
[6949.06 --> 6954.58]  like there's an opportunity for me to be taken advantage of i must understand both sides of the
[6954.58 --> 6964.02]  deal or i can't sign it is a policy of of mine for life um so i just uh unless there's something in
[6964.02 --> 6969.46]  it for you i couldn't do it and because my intention is not to go public and because my intention
[6970.02 --> 6976.66]  is not to sell linus media group to the highest corporate bidder there's no there's no end game for
[6976.66 --> 6981.62]  you what's your exit strategy there's nothing and if i really wanted a loan we're at the point now
[6981.62 --> 6986.42]  where our business performance is so strong over such an extended period of time that if we really need
[6986.42 --> 6995.06]  a loan we can get one so if i need money i will just do it like that and if the idea is like a big
[6995.06 --> 7001.62]  moonshot payout then this is not the place to be right so that's where that's where i'm at on that
[7001.62 --> 7013.54]  that's why for now we have no we have no um yeah we have no intention of exploring of exploring that
[7014.50 --> 7019.62]  uh curated messages are we almost done the curated messages yeah but there's like a bunch
[7019.62 --> 7025.38]  wow look at that incoming section oh bloody hell okay um okay okay we can only do a few more so
[7025.38 --> 7031.70]  i'm gonna surprise my dad with some tech stuff nice will you look at the camera and say merry
[7031.70 --> 7040.10]  christmas and have a happy new year i think is the timing i don't know what the timing is so good
[7040.10 --> 7048.10]  luck everybody um someone said is this thing censored f yeah water bottle uh it is censored by us deciding
[7048.10 --> 7054.26]  if it shows up on screen or not so it's censored yes yeah see you later uh george f been watching
[7054.26 --> 7060.02]  since the house water cooling i have a 3070 ti and my display doesn't wake after sleep oh man i had
[7060.02 --> 7068.34]  this problem too with my nvidia card what did i do um okay you have to search for uh there's a there's a
[7068.34 --> 7073.54]  there's a stupid command prompt thing that you can use there's a command you can use to check what
[7073.54 --> 7079.46]  is keeping your pc from uh oh wait oh shoot no my issue was my display wasn't going to sleep
[7079.46 --> 7083.94]  my display doesn't wake after sleep i have to reset it to get it to work again no i i
[7083.94 --> 7089.70]  i have not personally fixed that one i've only done it the other way on linux but not on windows so
[7090.34 --> 7095.54]  i mean you should definitely try doing a full reinstall of your drivers so you're gonna want
[7095.54 --> 7102.34]  to go and uh like fully uh ddu them go in safe mode ddu them reinstall them if that doesn't fix it
[7102.34 --> 7106.82]  one thing you could start to tinker around with is sleep states in your bios i had an issue with my
[7106.82 --> 7110.98]  threadripper machine in my office which i was very disappointed about it was just crashing like
[7110.98 --> 7116.10]  just randomly when i wasn't doing anything and it turns out that i was able to fix it by just um
[7116.10 --> 7122.90]  adjusting my lowest sleep state up one in the bios and then it just is perfect now yeah so maybe try
[7122.90 --> 7130.90]  not letting it go as to sleep uh nick allows says uh any info on flowplane app crashing when not using
[7130.90 --> 7139.62]  google apps we know that that's like a thing but the amount of users that we have that are on android
[7139.62 --> 7146.90]  and aren't using google apps is like real low so there are some other major things in terms of the
[7146.90 --> 7151.70]  app that we are currently working on we actually rolled out a version this week um i don't know if
[7151.70 --> 7157.94]  it's at 100 rollout yet so you might not have access to it but maybe try that version maybe that'll help
[7157.94 --> 7160.98]  um cool don't know
[7164.18 --> 7171.22]  what's the uh man i feel i feel my energy dying okay uh thanks alexander b you know merry christmas to
[7171.22 --> 7175.94]  your son i think we're good i don't think there's going to be any roku float plane app anytime soon
[7176.74 --> 7182.82]  um save me from bezos i can't ian i'm sorry there's nothing i can do uh thanks chris p
[7182.82 --> 7190.42]  new grandpa says mark h need to start a grandchild on gaming early got the abcs of gaming absolutely
[7190.42 --> 7197.62]  love it and you'd already did nick laus's and he plans for lt team mugs yeah so mugs are one of those
[7197.62 --> 7204.02]  ones that i just on principle kind of avoided for the longest time because it just felt like we weren't
[7204.02 --> 7209.46]  really contributing anything like the world is full of so many mugs you know like if you just go to a
[7209.46 --> 7216.34]  thrift store and just like go rescue a bunch of mugs from the landfill is sort of the way that
[7216.34 --> 7221.06]  i've always felt about it um like insulated water bottles were something i was totally comfortable
[7221.06 --> 7226.50]  with because a they're super on brand for me i love drinking my ice cold water that's just like my
[7226.50 --> 7231.46]  thing always been a thing that's what i drink um and so just it's something that i personally need
[7231.46 --> 7236.74]  it i mean that's the that's the genesis of so many of our merch items it's like i need i mean that's
[7236.74 --> 7240.98]  where this one came from i want a beanie i need a jacket i need a jacket
[7243.62 --> 7252.10]  so what could i say and i i don't use mugs so like there was no it's always what's my pain point
[7252.10 --> 7257.54]  right because it's not just i need any jacket it's like i need a jacket that's exactly the way that i
[7257.54 --> 7265.38]  like a jacket to be so i don't have a preference for mugs so i just don't really care about them
[7265.38 --> 7270.34]  um and you know you go to a thrift store you can get a mug for like a dollar and it'll probably like
[7270.34 --> 7275.86]  say something funny on it or whatever so i'm not saying no i'm just saying it's been extremely
[7276.50 --> 7284.90]  low priority yeah it's where i'm at on that um nice thanks anonymous for the message on the thing
[7284.90 --> 7290.98]  okay i think we're gonna call it here yeah i think we're thank you so much ladies and gentlemen
[7290.98 --> 7298.58]  and everything in between we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[7298.58 --> 7306.18]  bye
[7308.18 --> 7316.26]  i love that the merch message portion of the show is now officially a but it's officially a
[7318.18 --> 7324.74]  ramping up viewership portion of the show people are super into it when we used to do super chats
[7324.74 --> 7331.54]  no one cares that's really interesting yeah by the way the super chat problem that i've had is still
[7331.54 --> 7337.06]  there so if you sent a super chat during the show in fact i can see i can see that there are super
[7337.06 --> 7343.30]  chats here but there's nothing in here youtube is apparently working on a fix for me i have no idea
[7343.30 --> 7348.42]  why the fix is for me and not just for the platform because this has been a problem for months
[7348.42 --> 7354.02]  um it's probably because they want you to stop so just a reminder guys let people know in the chat
[7354.74 --> 7361.22]  don't use super chats because if i don't specifically click this and then never refresh the page
[7361.78 --> 7367.38]  they're just gone they're gone forever i have no way of knowing oh okay apparently i can click these
[7368.34 --> 7374.26]  okay oh it only goes over so far genius i'm clicking this arrow and it's not going over more even
[7374.26 --> 7381.22]  though i can see there are more messages oh fantastic all right well hey thanks guys um
[7382.82 --> 7387.86]  yes there are inverted cases i think silverstone has one oh it's not scrolling left anymore now
[7389.94 --> 7395.70]  unbelievable i do i do love how conrad's
