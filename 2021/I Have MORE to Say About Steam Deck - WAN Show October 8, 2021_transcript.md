[0.00 --> 2.16]  this anxiety all the things i didn't do
[2.16 --> 12.78]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to the wang to the wang show we've got a fantastic show for you guys
[12.78 --> 19.82]  today we are back in the studio back bringing you the latest in tech and boy do i ever have
[19.82 --> 26.82]  some stuff to talk to you guys about i have tried the oled switch now oh and i'm ready to talk about
[26.82 --> 32.00]  my experiences i did not get to host the short circuit because i was busy doing other stuff today
[32.00 --> 37.92]  and it sucks but i did manage to go crash anthony's party and try it out so i'm going to talk about
[37.92 --> 46.28]  that that's cool also i ended up entering a feud with team viewer um over this last week because
[46.28 --> 51.46]  i've kind of had to do a little bit more remote desktopy type stuff i'm i'm reformatting my
[51.46 --> 57.66]  personal rig as you guys know maybe we'll give you some updates on the uh linux gaming challenge
[57.66 --> 62.06]  yep we don't want any spoilers obviously but we are going to be talking about that what else we got
[62.06 --> 69.72]  today luke uh i'm going to scroll down twitch has leaked just like the the whole thing and luke in
[69.72 --> 76.36]  particular i mean you might have noticed he works on a um a video streaming service so i'm sure he has a
[76.36 --> 82.20]  an interest in the contents of the twitch leak also our headline topic i didn't say it so you better
[82.20 --> 90.00]  say it steam deck oh yeah uh i thought you talked about that earlier but i guess not uh valve dangles
[90.00 --> 94.26]  steam deck internals in front of all of us they show us all the insides how to remove some of it
[94.26 --> 98.86]  and they announce some very cool things for right to repair and i was getting called out on our title
[98.86 --> 102.80]  for the video today i have more to say about steam deck this is in the pre-show do you really have
[102.80 --> 111.08]  more to say lines no but i am not the only host of the wan show hey there we go okay luke this is a
[111.08 --> 117.92]  new leaf okay new set new attitude new luke luke first show i'm not even going to do it i'm not even
[117.92 --> 122.52]  going to talk for the rest of the show that's you go ahead that's rough you go ahead well we run the
[122.52 --> 131.76]  intro you can do that without talking no i can't do it you can't even hold it you can't hold it for
[131.76 --> 139.52]  the intro video you look like he's gonna explode you guys didn't see it but it was there
[139.52 --> 148.86]  all right i'm talking again oh okay let me see if i can figure out jake jake showed me how this is
[148.86 --> 153.96]  supposed to work i think i thought they were supposed to be up there by default uh no as well
[153.96 --> 163.50]  as see sonic as well as squaspies now i toggle those back okay this is really this is really
[163.50 --> 168.98]  not that great that's fine let's go back to the white all right let's jump right into our headline
[168.98 --> 176.22]  topic today valve dangles steam deck internals in front of users says no touchy uh this was prepared
[176.22 --> 184.62]  by anthony young sort of it's a little complicated so luke did you watch valve's video yeah all right
[184.62 --> 191.78]  what are your thoughts i had the same thought you had part way through watching through the the actual
[191.78 --> 196.60]  just video before i watched you guys watch the video you've watched both i did so you watched an
[196.60 --> 200.12]  actual video then you watched someone else react to the video i didn't know you guys were going to
[200.12 --> 205.24]  react to it how does it feel to be gen z all of a sudden just well i i watched you guys react to it
[205.24 --> 213.32]  because i was looking for a float plane showed out yes so i watched it at like one and a half speed or
[213.32 --> 219.26]  something right okay but anyways i watched the original video um and it was good i'm very happy
[219.26 --> 224.54]  they made it the other option was oh no there's two other options as you kind of talked about so i'm
[224.54 --> 228.80]  happy they made it they picked like the middle option not making it would have been worse yeah but i
[228.80 --> 233.68]  yeah i think they should have worked with you guys ah yeah and like for a lot of the same reasons like
[233.68 --> 238.46]  i'm watching we had the same reactions like the okay we're gonna unplug the battery and then the
[238.46 --> 243.80]  battery's randomly plugged back in we're gonna show like the the the thumbsticks out and then thumbsticks
[243.80 --> 248.72]  are gonna be back in randomly it's just like ah like the the cutting was a little weird but again
[248.72 --> 254.10]  i really don't want to hammer on them too much for it because at least they made it at all
[254.10 --> 259.60]  now here's something though i ended up getting called out in the comments under that video i think
[259.60 --> 266.30]  i had a couple of people tweet at me saying linus you didn't even understand okay it was like satirical
[266.30 --> 273.36]  it's like the portal sense of humor and i'm sitting here going no no i don't think so and again i mean
[273.36 --> 281.08]  it wasn't a horrible video no um it just could have been better yeah uh and like to be clear they did
[281.08 --> 285.82]  obviously have a sense of humor about it this is funny we actually missed this in our reaction video
[285.82 --> 290.56]  because we thought it was over but at the very end of the video they say something along the lines of
[290.56 --> 295.88]  and if you've been following all of these instructions you won't have done any of that stuff
[295.88 --> 300.50]  and then and then they close up the video so absolutely they had a sense of humor about it but
[300.50 --> 307.38]  i guarantee you that it was not intentional for them to be working on the machine with the battery
[307.38 --> 313.28]  plugged in yeah after they specifically said unplug the battery in order to work on the machine
[313.28 --> 318.94]  because that is actually very important it seemed like they they shot everything yeah and then voice
[318.94 --> 324.20]  over it and it really didn't line up all that well yes so they had to like cut it kind of oddly yes i
[324.20 --> 328.24]  thought the presenter was like actually pretty good but but anyways it was uh it was an exciting video
[328.24 --> 336.24]  um the the him specifically calling out and i i heard it as well he only really specified i think
[336.24 --> 342.36]  it was the thumbsticks yeah but but any amount of like replaceable parts is gonna be really cool and
[342.36 --> 348.22]  especially the thumbsticks yeah because like and i i believe anthony called this out but thumbsticks
[348.22 --> 354.46]  on things like the switch like oh my i mean another thing i got called out for was sort of um
[354.46 --> 362.00]  pretending that joy joystick drift is somehow a nintendo exclusive image oh no uh problem issue
[362.00 --> 368.30]  that's the word i was looking for and no that i mean it's certainly a very famous one it's certainly
[368.30 --> 375.58]  been a huge problem in very recent memory but to be clear joystick drift is an enormous problem no matter
[375.58 --> 380.30]  what kind of joysticks and someone in the comments put it really well they're like no no joystick
[380.30 --> 387.76]  problem joystick drift joystick failure is a problem for joysticks yeah every joystick will fail and it's
[387.76 --> 394.04]  kind of inherent to the design you know what finally failed is my old thrustmaster top gun oh no i yeah i
[394.04 --> 399.62]  it wasn't working the last time i tried to use it and i opened it up i was like okay so these are just
[399.62 --> 408.66]  potentiometers um is this something that i can a few short google searches later nope nope png if i really
[408.66 --> 414.10]  want another one of these ebay is the way i will just i will just buy another one because you know
[414.10 --> 420.60]  what the problem is is at the time that was bought for me as a kid right i was like seven or eight years
[420.60 --> 427.52]  old or something like that maybe nine and it was kind of a small joystick so that i could use it as a kid
[427.52 --> 435.66]  well nowadays any high quality joystick because the joystick market has consolidated a lot there used to be
[435.66 --> 441.76]  tons of vendors all kinds of high quality sticks because joystick games were far more popular i mean
[441.76 --> 450.08]  mech warrior was like a maybe not triple a but at least a single a double a title i also think well
[450.08 --> 457.40]  like microsoft simulator microsoft flight simulator is is like a thing today it was i would say proportionally
[457.40 --> 462.06]  a much bigger thing in the past yeah i think that's i think that's fair to say as well so that that whole
[462.06 --> 467.30]  genre of like space sims and flight sims was enormous back then and so we had all these options
[467.30 --> 473.56]  anyway the problem that i have now is that every high quality joystick is really designed for adult
[473.56 --> 481.78]  hands and so i i just i don't i can't reach the all the buttons i they're they're all sucks i find a
[481.78 --> 487.18]  lot of high quality ones like the warthog which is a really nice one yeah it's very heavy yeah and
[487.18 --> 492.34]  it's like the grip is one thing but it's very heavy and and that can almost result in it being slower i
[492.34 --> 497.30]  think we talked about this before the top gun is really fast yeah twitch reactions were really good
[497.30 --> 503.88]  with it um to to get back to the the the joystick drift i think the reason why i kind of jumped to
[503.88 --> 508.92]  nintendo right away yeah is one i think the the switch controllers probably get abused a lot more than
[508.92 --> 513.14]  other controllers yeah that's fair just slipped into a backpack in bags and stuff like that and also
[513.14 --> 517.38]  switch controllers are really expensive so yes i think you got a little bit of a combination i'm
[517.38 --> 521.74]  not trying to like hammer on nintendo specifically but we can hammer on nintendo for their controllers
[521.74 --> 527.62]  being way too expensive for what they are they are it's ridiculous yeah so that's that's why that like
[527.62 --> 534.44]  immediately came to mind is if there was a a more easily user fixable joycon thing that would be
[534.44 --> 540.76]  great that would be really really cool elimination twitch tv says no mech warrior 2 was definitely triple a
[540.76 --> 544.04]  back in the day everyone played it back then yeah that's fair that's fair
[544.04 --> 553.74]  so other than that i mean is there anything else to really say other than good guy good guy valve
[553.74 --> 556.90]  what do you think that they could do better if anything
[556.90 --> 569.20]  i'd like to know and like maybe this can come down the line but i'd like to know the full list of
[569.20 --> 574.16]  like replaceable hardware that they're going to be offering you guys mentioned probably not the pcbs
[574.16 --> 580.18]  whatever i don't know but i would like to know specifically what the offer actually is sure i
[580.18 --> 584.26]  think that would be cool and that's i mean that's going to happen because eventually they'll have to
[584.26 --> 589.08]  make them available somewhere and then that's your list um but yeah no i think it's i think it's good
[589.08 --> 595.16]  something i said to you uh after i had watched that video was that i'm just i'm really stoked that like
[595.16 --> 598.72]  from between the framework and now this and there's a topic we're going to be talking about
[598.72 --> 602.68]  later on in the show with that has to do with microsoft which is really exciting there's a lot
[602.68 --> 609.92]  of brands that are making repairability a selling point i'm completely okay with that um right to
[609.92 --> 615.66]  repair and repairability are things that i am very happy to be sold to me to be completely honest now
[615.66 --> 620.58]  here's my challenge for valve i think they've done a really great job with the steam deck so i don't
[620.58 --> 624.54]  really have anything to add to that i think committing to replaceable components and designing
[624.54 --> 632.88]  it uh from the ground up to be more easily repairable is is great a plus now take that
[632.88 --> 637.16]  philosophy and apply it to your other bloody products i had an issue with an index controller
[637.16 --> 644.44]  a little while ago where what happened was um definitely not my fault couldn't have been me but
[644.44 --> 651.80]  one of the joysticks like the the topper of it the actual joystick itself was no longer attached to
[651.80 --> 657.62]  the controller did you hit something i mean with the cut luke i'm trying to tell a story here
[657.62 --> 665.82]  okay keep going i actually i don't remember i didn't notice doing it i don't remember doing it
[665.82 --> 672.76]  but because i never ever used them yeah it could have been missing for weeks and i wouldn't have even
[672.76 --> 678.84]  noticed right because what would i use a joystick for all i do is wiggle my arms around like this
[678.84 --> 686.52]  right and so everything is a pointing interface i literally don't touch the joysticks ever uh anyway
[686.52 --> 693.08]  the point is i contacted valve support i was like hey look i just want a new joystick the ribbon cable
[693.08 --> 699.64]  is still intact and the sensor is still there i just do you i'll buy it i i recognize that this was
[699.64 --> 707.08]  99 my fault uh i own that but i i would like to how do i get replacement parts for it and they're like
[707.08 --> 714.12]  we will send you an entirely new controller so obviously as a customer i'm perfectly happy with
[714.12 --> 717.96]  that solution because it means that i get a new controller and i can a lot of ways i can start
[717.96 --> 724.36]  playing beat saber again but i also have to wonder okay what happens to that controller and it's not just
[724.36 --> 730.28]  replaceable parts that will wear or that will could fall off that could be broken like a joystick
[730.28 --> 738.36]  it's also batteries right like every device with a lithium battery in it is going to be e-waste in 10
[738.36 --> 747.16]  years yeah it is that simple it will and that's one of the reasons that people people ride on microsoft
[747.16 --> 755.88]  about using double-a batteries in their controllers but that is in my in my humble opinion that is
[755.88 --> 764.76]  microsoft having the bravery to in spite of public opinion do the right thing because if you care about
[764.76 --> 772.76]  the environment at all you should be getting double a rechargeable batteries and using them for years and
[772.76 --> 776.68]  years and years instead of putting disposable batteries in it because i see that argument made
[776.68 --> 782.68]  like oh microsoft is being so irresponsible because disposable batteries landfills xbox controllers stop
[782.68 --> 789.88]  buying the ones that you can't recharge the the really shocking part to me is how it's inexpensive
[789.88 --> 798.76]  rechargeable batteries are now why is anyone ever buying a disposable double-a battery in the year 2021 yeah
[798.76 --> 804.68]  you can even buy ones where you like you flip the top open the capacity sucks do they yeah the
[804.68 --> 810.04]  capacity sucks how long are you playing with an xbox controller for uh yeah just it's it's really low
[810.04 --> 814.52]  it's really low because cells are they're packed i don't remember what i used it in but i had some for
[814.52 --> 820.76]  years and i thought they were fine uh hold on amazon basics double-a batteries okay rechargeable here
[820.76 --> 827.56]  we go how how much are these stupid things i don't know what power owl is okay so a 16 pack of
[827.56 --> 838.84]  2 000 milliamp hour double-a batteries from amazon is 22.99 okay a 20 pack of alkalines disposables
[839.48 --> 848.28]  because you can just hot swap a 20 pack of disposables is eight dollars you only have to use them
[848.28 --> 854.28]  three times i don't even you know i used to be that when i uh like gave away kids toys and stuff like
[854.28 --> 861.24]  that i would i would like painstakingly open up every single one and double check and make sure
[861.24 --> 865.64]  that i didn't leave my rechargeable batteries in it and i i still try to empty them because you're not
[865.64 --> 869.80]  supposed to leave them uh with a battery in it but if there's something at the bottom of the pile and
[869.80 --> 873.48]  i'm like oh did i check that one i'm not going to worry about it too much these days because they are
[873.48 --> 882.12]  literally like a dollar 25 each and they we still have sanyo eneloops here at the office that we still use for
[882.12 --> 888.92]  our mic packs that have been in service for almost 10 years yeah they yes they don't last quite as long
[888.92 --> 895.00]  oh i'm sorry but i i think that microsoft has done the right thing to continue with double-a batteries
[895.00 --> 902.36]  and i think that they should never take flack for releasing a device here there this is my hot take
[902.36 --> 910.44]  nobody should ever get pushback for releasing a device that uses standard easily replaceable batteries
[911.00 --> 915.48]  that are yeah that have rechargeable options which they basically all do which they basically all do
[915.48 --> 919.32]  i mean you can even get decent rechargeable nine volts now so that's what we use for we have a
[919.32 --> 924.92]  microphone that's uh has a wireless receiver that uses nine volts and so we just we have rechargeable
[924.92 --> 934.84]  nine volts now it's just it just blows me away it blows me away that anyone like i have xbox 360
[934.84 --> 941.24]  luke you were over the other day and uh he's like oh this is nice it was nice yeah uh because i have
[941.24 --> 946.76]  xbox 360 controllers that are still in service yeah and still get exactly the same battery life that they
[946.76 --> 954.36]  did 12 years ago because i put new batteries in them it's not it's not rocket science it's great
[955.48 --> 959.64]  and endeloops like yeah endeloops are are a little bit more premium but they're honestly still
[960.28 --> 966.68]  how much did you say the 16 pack was um 16 pack are eneloops still around i thought sanyo sold
[966.68 --> 973.88]  uh the eneloop they they seem still around they're panasonic now okay that makes sense uh the 16 pack was
[973.88 --> 982.36]  23. okay so i don't know how many are in here it doesn't say but it's a fairly yeah 16 for 40. even that
[982.36 --> 987.16]  is perfectly reasonable that's like those i would say those aren't the the pros or whatever but those
[987.16 --> 991.96]  are going to be premium you only have to get five uses out of them and that's it now there's certain
[991.96 --> 999.56]  devices that sometimes i'll just go you know what it's it's not worth it like uh a tv remote control
[1001.72 --> 1007.64]  rechargeable batteries do tend to drain faster on their own like just passively they're a lot better now
[1007.64 --> 1012.84]  than they used to be back in the nickel metal hydride nickel nickel cadmium i guess was some of
[1012.84 --> 1018.52]  the earlier rechargeable batteries because remember our hydra devices back then the big one was digital
[1018.52 --> 1025.24]  cameras and so when you would load up your your four double a batteries into the grip of it or whatever
[1025.24 --> 1034.92]  and you'd get like you we oh my man i'm taking i'm taken back luke i'm taken back it used to be a
[1034.92 --> 1039.24]  thing and this would have probably been before your time you probably would have been too young and not
[1039.24 --> 1043.16]  caring about digital cameras yet by this point because you're you're like four years younger than
[1043.16 --> 1049.64]  me something like that yeah so when i was when i was like 14 so you would have been 10 so it probably
[1049.64 --> 1056.28]  wouldn't matter digital cameras on the store shelf used to have as part of their spec sheet how many
[1056.28 --> 1063.88]  shots you could take yeah okay you do remember that and it would be substantially less with rechargeables
[1063.88 --> 1069.56]  because the rechargeables of the day had really poor capacity they took forever to charge and they
[1069.56 --> 1076.12]  would drain while you were not using them nowadays it's not nearly as bad although there are devices like
[1076.12 --> 1082.68]  uh tv remote where you will get three or four years sometimes out of a single change of batteries
[1083.16 --> 1088.12]  and it's you would just be constantly changing out your rechargeables compared to how often you would
[1088.12 --> 1094.92]  have to uh put in disposables so there are situations where i do get lazy and use disposables rather than
[1094.92 --> 1100.60]  just buying more and more and more rechargeables for my entire house but it really doesn't uh it really
[1100.60 --> 1105.96]  doesn't come up that often anymore right yeah i don't even remember i don't even remember what
[1105.96 --> 1110.68]  we were talking about talking about something to do right the index the index controller
[1111.88 --> 1117.24]  and i don't even know i don't even know that the right answer with the index controller is to put
[1117.96 --> 1125.16]  um to put double a batteries in it it would probably be too heavy uh with that said i mean oculus
[1125.16 --> 1132.20]  managed it but the index controller also has a lot more functionality yeah than the oculus uh than
[1132.20 --> 1137.96]  the oculus controllers yeah so maybe that's not the right answer but having it be easily accessible
[1137.96 --> 1144.36]  with a little screw panel so that you could at least not throw away the entire controller uh would
[1144.36 --> 1149.16]  help because you can i know i know like my brother and some other people that i know have have had
[1149.16 --> 1154.92]  wireless headphones and they replace those lithium ion batteries anyways sometimes with ones that are
[1154.92 --> 1161.24]  even bigger and stuff which is kind of nice all right so anthony has a few notes in here about the
[1161.24 --> 1168.68]  ssd valve claims it shouldn't be upgraded uh it has an emi shield on it that is right next to the wi-fi
[1168.68 --> 1178.44]  module or the wi-fi antennas would you buy a third party backing that allows you to put a larger ssd in it
[1178.44 --> 1184.84]  would that just be like have you pre-ordered one yeah actually you have okay okay so then i pre-ordered
[1184.84 --> 1189.24]  one the day we talked about on lan show as a future i actually pre-ordered it in the background while we
[1189.24 --> 1197.80]  were still on lan show because i wanted to not get too late in the queue all right i'll allow it i'll allow
[1197.80 --> 1202.36]  it i'll allow it so then okay if someone makes something like that available do you plan to buy it
[1202.36 --> 1210.12]  um not immediately because i would i would self-analyze my use case to see if i actually
[1210.12 --> 1216.44]  really needed eight terabyte steam deck anyone but like do i um why am i my games drive my computer
[1216.44 --> 1224.36]  isn't even that full i guess that's fair you're mostly like a play a game and then move on move on
[1224.36 --> 1229.40]  kind of player aren't you yeah i guess that's for most the the things that i tend to go back to are
[1229.40 --> 1235.64]  usually like indie games that are tiny gondomar says wtf luke bought something it must be really
[1235.64 --> 1243.16]  good holy shiz i'm pretty excited for the steam deck i i think it's gonna be really cool um now i
[1243.16 --> 1248.68]  think that transitions us pretty well into our next topic here which is obviously going to be getting
[1248.68 --> 1254.28]  you guys an update on the linux gaming challenge ah if you guys have been checking out the stories that
[1254.28 --> 1259.24]  i've been uploading on the ltt channel there's a couple of little oh i didn't know that early teasers in
[1259.24 --> 1266.12]  there but okay without giving away too many spoilers i think it's you know we've both recorded
[1266.12 --> 1273.64]  our or you we've at least got down what we're gonna say in our uh you know our pre pre-installation
[1273.64 --> 1281.00]  blurbs because the first video is going to be me sort of talking about the process of getting started
[1281.00 --> 1287.72]  so i actually i it's like 500 600 words and i go through i've got a rant about how utterly useless
[1287.72 --> 1294.36]  every you know best linux distro listicle is yeah it's it's kind of hilarious there's this one man
[1294.36 --> 1297.96]  this is going to be too many spoilers i don't even care let's just let's talk about it let's talk about
[1297.96 --> 1306.92]  it i read through one where you're already ready for this i know it under ubuntu okay you've got you've
[1306.92 --> 1312.84]  got that it's easy to use and beginner friendly and kind of a pain to set up
[1315.56 --> 1324.44]  how can you have this this is the same listicle okay it has pros easy to use beginner friendly cons
[1324.44 --> 1334.28]  kind of a pain to set up which one is it i found a few i i found a few youtube videos yeah i wish i could
[1334.28 --> 1339.40]  remember the the creator names from because they're actually quite good but what i found was more
[1339.40 --> 1347.32]  useful was if i was comparing two very specific des or sure two very specific distros now that's another
[1347.32 --> 1352.20]  thing down to like something more narrow everything's full of jargon so you just said de
[1353.08 --> 1360.92]  yeah what is a de if i didn't know anything if i didn't know enough about the modularity of linux for
[1360.92 --> 1367.16]  example if i was really coming at this from a just normal gamer perspective and people started
[1367.16 --> 1373.24]  talking about des even if they didn't shorten it to des even if they said desktop environment you'd
[1373.24 --> 1378.76]  probably think it was the distro they were talking about and to be fair for most people um like i i
[1378.76 --> 1386.04]  would argue that when most people think about say mint sure they they're just automatically mentally
[1386.04 --> 1390.20]  bundling in that you're using cinnamon i would argue that when most people are talking about
[1390.20 --> 1393.72]  uh solace they're thinking of budgie when they're talking about ubuntu they're thinking about gnome
[1393.72 --> 1398.28]  like yes you can have other ones a lot of these come packaged with other ones like you can get yeah
[1398.28 --> 1404.12]  you can get ubuntu budgie uh sure but like most people if they just say ubuntu are probably talking
[1404.12 --> 1412.84]  about ubuntu with gnome sure um so so the first bit is me sort of it it ends up a little ranty because
[1412.84 --> 1420.76]  it's just ridiculous coming in is an absolute no nothing honestly i wouldn't be surprised if you
[1420.76 --> 1426.92]  immediately read one article and go forget this this is too much yeah i think the the distro and desktop
[1426.92 --> 1435.96]  environment uh selection process is probably too daunting alone for the average user and so after that
[1435.96 --> 1443.08]  i basically uh i talk about what the process was like for me i run through what my plan is and then
[1443.08 --> 1448.68]  we're gonna cut to luke he talks through what his plan is and then i don't know if i told you this but
[1448.68 --> 1455.64]  anthony is going to listen to each of our plans no no he doesn't get to talk to us so part of the whole
[1455.64 --> 1460.76]  challenge is that luke and i have to do this the way a normal user would i mean i've had developers reach
[1460.76 --> 1468.36]  out multiple developers from major distributions to talk to me because obviously they want you to use
[1468.36 --> 1472.68]  their stuff they want me to use their stuff and not just that they don't just want me to use their
[1472.68 --> 1475.88]  stuff because it's a good marketing exercise i think they're just really proud of their work and
[1475.88 --> 1480.20]  so they should be and i think i think that's probably very genuinely a thing with the open source
[1480.20 --> 1487.80]  community absolutely 100 give them that absolutely but that's not representative of the normal
[1487.80 --> 1495.24]  person's experience and in order to be the best that i can be in order to be the best ally that i
[1495.24 --> 1501.48]  can be for the open source community and for the linux community i should try to tackle this as a
[1501.48 --> 1509.16]  normal user should and i should be able to give my honest feedback without someone preemptively guiding
[1509.16 --> 1515.16]  me through so even though we are going to have anthony there for the benefit of the viewers anthony doesn't
[1515.16 --> 1521.32]  get to talk to us interesting okay cool yeah no 100 yeah so from there i want to address one thing
[1521.32 --> 1525.88]  before we go forward because i saw another comment about it yeah i think uh i spread it further when
[1525.88 --> 1530.76]  i tweeted out like what's four of these distros do people think i should use yeah and i included fedora
[1530.76 --> 1536.68]  and then in brackets for the meme i don't mean that fedora the distro is a meme i mean that fedora the
[1536.68 --> 1544.20]  name is a meme it really is a meme come on guys like we we use it we use it it's good it's really
[1544.20 --> 1551.00]  stable it's great just the name is a meme okay okay sorry let's keep going all right so i mean oh my god
[1551.00 --> 1559.88]  even the red hat logo yes like yes like come on guys clearly self-aware clearly at least some of the
[1559.88 --> 1568.60]  people at red hat are self-aware anyway the point is um after that so after anthony critiques our plans
[1568.60 --> 1574.60]  it goes into a vlog and i don't know how you shot your portion but mine is me with like my phone
[1575.24 --> 1582.04]  and no okay there will be some spoilers not too many spoilers but i end up back and forth between my
[1582.04 --> 1587.88]  desktop and my server room which is on the other side of the wall where my machine is actually plugged in
[1587.88 --> 1596.12]  a fair bit oh wow a fair bit because i mean you got to remember you got to remember you can't take
[1596.12 --> 1602.68]  anything for granted right i use a thunderbolt dog for literally all of my peripherals someone at float
[1602.68 --> 1611.32]  plane brought up that that might be an issue i have a very very unusual setup definitely all of my audio
[1611.32 --> 1619.08]  is routed through a go xlr a device that has quite literally zero acknowledgement from the manufacturer
[1619.08 --> 1625.16]  of the fact that linux exists at all and all this elgato stuff uh i don't actually have a ton of elgato
[1625.16 --> 1630.68]  stuff at home i've got my key lights but key lights my workaround is going to be using the phone app
[1630.68 --> 1635.80]  which they do have oh right okay okay i can't be giving you too many hints we got to work through these
[1635.80 --> 1640.52]  problems on our own do you okay all right all right all right all right all right all right all right
[1640.52 --> 1646.04]  so elgato uh key lights i have those and i have a stream deck but i'm just sad i wasted time now but
[1646.04 --> 1652.04]  anyways yeah i don't i don't use my stream deck so yeah i don't really care yeah
[1654.68 --> 1658.92]  anyway the point is i oh okay i'm not gonna
[1658.92 --> 1669.24]  uh okay part one the part one challenge is to install linux choose a distro install linux and play
[1669.24 --> 1677.56]  a game that's it it took me longer to find the screw for the m.2 drive uh than it did for me to
[1677.56 --> 1687.88]  finish the entire first challenge okay um i am a smart boy and i keep all my m.2 screws in my motherboard
[1687.88 --> 1692.04]  even when i get a brand new board i take all the m.2 screws and i put them it was your motherboard
[1692.04 --> 1695.48]  it wasn't there really yeah well bro
[1699.48 --> 1707.80]  i did it with my new machine so i have all my m.2 screws oh it's the that azurok aqua one isn't it
[1707.80 --> 1714.76]  hey look price was right oh it was fantastic i'm still stoked your computer was free sir i was only
[1714.76 --> 1720.68]  using it as like a reference that i did the rest of it relatively quickly that show off um anyway
[1720.68 --> 1727.96]  the point is uh i did not get it done that quickly okay so part one is to play a game i actually did not
[1727.96 --> 1736.28]  strictly speaking complete the part one challenge in like three hours not strictly speaking not strictly
[1736.28 --> 1742.04]  speaking because my intention when i actually created the original here i'm not signed into trello on this
[1742.04 --> 1748.04]  machine but when i created the original like trello list of all the parts of this series part one is
[1748.04 --> 1755.24]  supposed to be um install and play a game on the distro of your choice yeah part two is supposed to be
[1755.24 --> 1760.44]  i got i gotta pull up trello here because i can't remember exactly i think it was i think it was yeah
[1760.44 --> 1766.36]  install like steam and play a game linus steam was the easy one okay part two is get your game
[1766.36 --> 1774.12]  streaming setup working perfectly so mics levels capture camera um i have to get a vpn working so
[1774.12 --> 1783.16]  that i can download assets like just sort of general general use stuff uh part three is uh get as many
[1783.16 --> 1790.28]  game launchers running as possible and run a game on them so we're aiming to get as many of the big ones
[1790.28 --> 1795.00]  as we can and even maybe some smaller ones part four is going to be fun i've talked to james about
[1795.00 --> 1801.56]  this now and it's going to be hey by the way gaming is not the only thing you do do some other stuff so
[1801.56 --> 1807.72]  we're going to have challenges like edit a quick video together uh create a document uh zip up some
[1807.72 --> 1815.56]  files and send them to someone print something uh watch netflix um something to do with excel and don't
[1815.56 --> 1821.32]  don't do any of those things now don't get ahead of yourself on that one no practicing okay that one
[1821.32 --> 1825.80]  i'm not ahead on okay the other ones i am all right okay well i'm ahead on some of the streaming
[1825.80 --> 1829.88]  stuff too okay okay so i'm already working on it i'm just making a lot of notes because i think it's
[1829.88 --> 1835.96]  going to end up being a lot of screen capture and a lot of like kind of ranting about stuff so as long
[1835.96 --> 1839.56]  as you're making notes and as long as you're screen recording as often as you can then i think
[1839.56 --> 1844.04]  we're in pretty good shape uh that was one of the reasons actually that i got some of the streaming
[1844.04 --> 1851.48]  stuff going yeah that's the same for me before i even finished challenge one oh wow because i wanted
[1851.48 --> 1858.60]  to be able to screen cap yeah that makes sense right fortunately obs is a thing and mostly operates the
[1858.60 --> 1865.24]  same so i was able to get that going and then part five i think is honestly just going to be the
[1865.24 --> 1871.40]  conclusion right so we summarize and we make an ultimate decision about whether to go back to windows
[1871.40 --> 1876.76]  or not talk about killer apps that we miss talk about killer apps on linux that we're going to
[1876.76 --> 1881.40]  miss uh what are the things we found that we really enjoyed what are the things we hated so now let's
[1881.40 --> 1887.56]  get back to part one and talk about how it is that i did not manage to complete the challenge when i wrote
[1887.56 --> 1894.68]  this down right right that was why i brought my phone out i wrote part one get linux or actually gnu slash
[1894.68 --> 1901.64]  linux and play a game with sound that's what it says verbatim because yes i even make jokes when i'm
[1901.64 --> 1909.96]  the only one who will ever read them i couldn't get sound working sound couldn't get sound working i've
[1909.96 --> 1917.00]  heard it magically fixed itself oh the next day i didn't do anything different and i have screen
[1917.00 --> 1923.40]  capture of it not working and then it magically works i promise you i did nothing and it's linux so it
[1923.40 --> 1929.32]  probably didn't update itself because it would wait for you to ask you to do the laptop just okay
[1930.20 --> 1937.16]  um that's interesting yeah i remember like way back one of my times using linux like way in the past
[1937.16 --> 1942.76]  getting sound stuff working on one of my laptops was was quite a hurdle um but this time i just had
[1942.76 --> 1949.80]  to change the device it was actually yeah i was i was pretty lucky i had i had some i had some challenges
[1949.80 --> 1955.24]  yeah uh okay so tell tell me this tell me this at least i've already got a killer app on the linux
[1955.24 --> 1961.00]  side by the way proprietary or open source and video driver proprietary you went with the proprietary
[1961.00 --> 1966.28]  driver yeah it's a piece of crap yes it is i'm struggling with it right now it's kind of shocking
[1966.28 --> 1971.16]  i'm i've i've i haven't done enough of it and i want to do a lot of documentation of it actually
[1971.16 --> 1975.32]  including some benchmarks that i want to throw in yeah that i think might be kind of fun i know it's not
[1975.32 --> 1981.32]  part of the challenge but it might be interesting anyways um of like the how do i pronounce it no
[1981.32 --> 1989.88]  vu no vu i don't know the open source driver whatever so that one versus uh 470 versus 460
[1989.88 --> 1996.76]  which are the two official right sure but like i've had some issues for sure yeah that just feels
[1997.32 --> 2003.08]  gross like i don't know have you like thrown windows around and done stuff like that a little bit
[2003.08 --> 2008.04]  i've noticed that compared to my windows experience things are a little bit more like
[2008.92 --> 2014.76]  yes um yeah even with like do you have the refresh rate fixed uh i managed to get my refresh rate
[2014.76 --> 2018.04]  sorted out pretty quickly that was one of the first things i did because i get triggered when
[2018.04 --> 2024.12]  my screen is running at 60 hertz these days yeah it was really apparent yeah i thought that was the
[2024.12 --> 2031.24]  whole problem at first it felt worse like 60 hertz felt worse than 60 hertz yes uh but now that i'm at
[2031.24 --> 2040.44]  120 it's totally fine what about g-sync i i haven't verified that it's running i have verified that it's
[2040.44 --> 2046.52]  running okay but i cannot find a toggle if for whatever reason i wanted to turn it off interesting
[2046.52 --> 2052.04]  so that's where i'm at on that because remember like my someone in the uh in the youtube chat pointed
[2052.04 --> 2058.68]  out and this is very true my setup is super cutting edge and exotic in a lot of ways
[2058.68 --> 2065.96]  like g-sync over hdmi is you might think yeah g-sync that's not new technology but g-sync over hdmi only
[2065.96 --> 2071.48]  came up really in the last year or two yeah you have quite a few unique challenges and no joke a year
[2071.48 --> 2077.96]  or two is not a long time if you don't have really excellent cooperation from the manufacturer to get
[2077.96 --> 2086.36]  something working in linux yeah especially when it's super high-end because the priority for linux in
[2086.36 --> 2093.24]  general in my from my perception is openness and sustainability not like cutting edge gaming
[2093.80 --> 2099.88]  and that's just that that's that's just the way it is so a lot of the cutting edge gaming stuff that i
[2099.88 --> 2107.32]  have and that i do is just not going to be um not going to be a priority for most linux developers now
[2107.32 --> 2112.84]  the reason we're doing this challenge is that it's hopefully changing and the steam deck is a big part
[2112.84 --> 2117.00]  of that that's why we transition from talking about steam deck to this because steam deck will be
[2117.00 --> 2123.88]  running linux yeah but it's gonna take time another thing someone brought up is you're also running an
[2123.88 --> 2131.72]  nvidia gpu right yeah so we we almost certainly would have had an easier time on both sides if we were
[2131.72 --> 2137.64]  running amd gpus yeah possibly but then i wouldn't be running g-sync at all actually i'm thinking yeah
[2137.64 --> 2143.08]  free sync over hdmi is is a thing on that monitor oh actually i don't know it's not the lgtv it's
[2143.08 --> 2150.20]  aor's monitor i have no idea how it behaves with free sync not sure no idea there's a lot of
[2150.20 --> 2154.20]  differences when it comes down to hardware i was even kind of wondering like i don't think a titan
[2154.20 --> 2162.28]  rtx is like a super common card no but it's similar enough to the 2000 series it's basically a 2080 ti
[2162.28 --> 2167.32]  which is basically a jacked up 2080 like i'm not actually expecting that to be a problem for me
[2167.32 --> 2174.12]  i will tell you though just man i don't know what it is i think i i just i attract misery sometimes
[2175.24 --> 2181.48]  the first game i tried to play i was like oh i've really been enjoying cave story plus it's an older
[2181.48 --> 2188.28]  game it's linux native it doesn't got a linux native client first game i picked has issues with
[2188.28 --> 2194.44]  launching off to the side okay so like part of the frame was cut off has issues with controller
[2194.44 --> 2199.88]  support the sound wasn't working and for whatever reason this particular game not every game other
[2199.88 --> 2206.12]  ones are fine crosscode was fine broforce was fine this particular game doesn't support cross-platform
[2206.12 --> 2212.04]  cloud saves on steam so i had no sound couldn't see part of the frame couldn't use my controller and my
[2212.04 --> 2219.72]  save file was gone so that was my very first linux gaming experience on my new machines i've definitely
[2219.72 --> 2225.08]  ran into the the cross-platform cloud saves thing that's unfortunate that didn't really make it into
[2225.08 --> 2233.00]  my notes okay well it's in mine so just for me that wasn't like starting to game on linux that was
[2233.00 --> 2238.52]  specifically transferring from windows to linux which i guess is part of it but yeah i don't know either way
[2238.52 --> 2244.68]  first game i launched was ftl had none of those issues just didn't have my save yeah so yeah but
[2244.68 --> 2254.60]  it worked yeah so there's been a lot of yeah there's have you tried another launcher um another launcher
[2254.60 --> 2262.36]  sorry what do you mean by launcher like bnet origin oh no no no not yet i i haven't even gotten as far as
[2262.36 --> 2269.40]  playing games with proton yet i i'm not i've i've only put maybe well remember first i put three
[2269.40 --> 2276.20]  hours into getting cave story running with no sound i did manage to fix the off kilter the off kilter
[2276.20 --> 2281.16]  rendering i ran in steam big picture mode what i was trying to diagnose at the time was actually the
[2281.16 --> 2287.08]  controller support i was like oh well big picture just solved it big pick part of big pictures whole jam
[2287.08 --> 2292.04]  is you know just making it super easy for controllers to work in steam games uh and in
[2292.04 --> 2296.20]  the interface so i figure okay if i go right into it from the interface i think the controller issue
[2296.20 --> 2302.12]  ended up being kind of pebcac and i was just i was just kind of overwhelmed by all the other issues that
[2302.12 --> 2307.64]  had cropped up in this game like i think i didn't select controller before trying to rebind my thing like
[2307.64 --> 2314.68]  it's kind of a weird interface that that game has um but anyway i it can be sometimes a little hard to
[2314.68 --> 2321.08]  differentiate between pebcac and the user experience just being pretty rough yeah so i did solve the
[2321.08 --> 2326.76]  off-center thing with steam big picture it would it would go right dead center and then i tried it
[2326.76 --> 2330.68]  again not in big picture and it was off to the right again and then the next day when i came back and
[2330.68 --> 2340.44]  sound was working it launched without big picture dead center and i was like okay all right thank you
[2340.44 --> 2346.84]  a little bit yeah that's cool oh man the uh the launcher experience is interesting that's all i'll
[2346.84 --> 2352.04]  say launcher experience okay well hey i have that to look forward to make sure you're working on the
[2352.04 --> 2357.40]  challenges kind of one at a time though luke otherwise things are going to end up kind of sloppy i i only
[2357.40 --> 2365.56]  added one other launcher to be fair okay all right all right and i was just i was very curious um i haven't
[2365.56 --> 2370.04]  gamed on linux at all before oh basically every time i've installed it it's been on a laptop and it was
[2370.04 --> 2376.68]  for school right um so they were always for like software development or or just like studying
[2376.68 --> 2385.56]  education productivity stuff in general anyways um so is it lutris yeah lutris is like super cool
[2386.28 --> 2387.32]  and very powerful
[2390.04 --> 2395.32]  and i don't want to add too much more to it yeah okay fair enough but i was i was very curious and
[2395.32 --> 2399.80]  like trying out lutris i've never tried it before these are my notes for part two
[2399.80 --> 2407.56]  already just to give you some idea um i mean honestly kind of getting worried my size just
[2407.56 --> 2413.24]  be really boring a lot of it's well maybe that'll be that maybe that'll be refreshing for the linux
[2413.24 --> 2419.72]  community because honestly i can tell you right now the linux community is going to absolutely hate
[2419.72 --> 2426.44]  my part one they are going to hate it and some of them will probably hate me because
[2426.44 --> 2435.32]  you just honestly i couldn't i i couldn't i couldn't write some of the stuff that happened to me
[2435.96 --> 2442.52]  like i couldn't i couldn't make it up um truth was was stranger than fiction and the thing is anytime i
[2442.52 --> 2448.68]  say anything whether it's positive or whether it's negative there's gonna be a small subset of users who are
[2448.68 --> 2456.20]  going to say he's shilling for this or trashing that or whatever he's got it he's got some agenda
[2456.20 --> 2463.40]  he's got some hidden motivation right and i guarantee it now mark my words someone who didn't watch this
[2463.40 --> 2470.04]  show didn't see me make this prediction is going to accuse me of fabricating yeah some of the things
[2470.04 --> 2475.88]  that went wrong for me to make it more dramatic and to make it dramatic or to to dunk on linux or whatever
[2475.88 --> 2484.20]  whatever maybe they think that bill gates's vaccine in my 5g reception is making me chill for windows
[2484.20 --> 2490.52]  like i don't i don't know i can't i can't put myself in the head of these people but i guarantee you
[2490.52 --> 2499.72]  that based on my experience someone will not believe how badly it went for me and will find a way to to
[2499.72 --> 2505.96]  make it about my hidden agenda here and then hopefully hopefully yeah hopefully my side does
[2505.96 --> 2510.36]  at least my part one because i haven't done the rest of it so maybe we'll maybe we'll switch sides
[2510.36 --> 2515.16]  later on um but hopefully my part one does contrast that because the the biggest problems
[2515.16 --> 2522.68]  that i had required uh sometimes slightly more than but pretty much just a restart right that was
[2522.68 --> 2527.40]  that was like pretty much i was surprised how much i have to restart on windows or on linux it's
[2527.40 --> 2531.80]  when windows has kind of fixed that there is some stuff you can get like i don't remember exactly
[2531.80 --> 2537.24]  what it's called but there's a live updating tool right that makes you don't have to restart um yeah
[2537.24 --> 2544.20]  i don't know i just i was just surprised like i i booted up and was just doing stuff like nothing with
[2544.20 --> 2548.76]  a brand new fresh image it was like hey you need to restart your computer because like we did some
[2548.76 --> 2555.00]  stuff oh really that okay i mean i guess yeah i guess windows does it all the time too i guess i just
[2555.00 --> 2558.52]  don't notice because it just schedules it and then just like runs in the middle of the night some
[2558.52 --> 2562.84]  stuff like the like it did it automatically yeah okay we're having a very different experience
[2564.92 --> 2572.12]  i'll just say that much nothing happened automatically on my side um which was i i mean that's just
[2572.12 --> 2578.68]  probably i haven't revealed what distro and and um desktop environment i'm using yet but that is gonna be
[2578.68 --> 2584.36]  part of it this is great rich 77 linus the linux community is here to help not slam a new user we are
[2584.36 --> 2593.08]  here for you uh that's rich get it yeah like yes you know what i'm sure that it's a minority of
[2593.08 --> 2599.80]  extremely toxic users just like any fan community there's going to be a minority of really toxic users
[2599.80 --> 2607.56]  there's just there's a special there's a special kind of toxic gatekeeping that seems to go on in
[2607.56 --> 2613.08]  the linux community and you're going to get called out in this video sorry there is there is extreme
[2613.72 --> 2617.72]  there's a lot of extremes there's toxic gatekeeping and then there's people that will just like stop
[2617.72 --> 2622.84]  at nothing to try to make sure that you know the door is open as wide as possible yeah um but there's
[2622.84 --> 2627.64]  sometimes to your detriment like no no it's really good it's really good it's really there's no problems
[2627.64 --> 2632.04]  ever i'll help you you can call me anytime night or day it's like right but i don't want to talk to
[2632.04 --> 2638.36]  you for three hours a day yeah i just want to use my computer this will work is there anything so far
[2638.36 --> 2644.36]  um and maybe this is going too much into it but is there anything so far that you've really liked or
[2644.36 --> 2649.48]  has gone really well hold on speed style says the linux community is here for you now until they see
[2649.48 --> 2656.76]  your video and can't wait to correct everything you should have done yeah pretty much um so it's not so
[2656.76 --> 2662.12]  much that i've seen things that i absolutely love about linux as much as i've been reminded that i should
[2662.12 --> 2669.32]  really make sure that i'm not coming at this from a completely one-sided standpoint and my rants should
[2669.32 --> 2675.00]  include rants about windows yeah okay something something i complained about with linux in general
[2675.00 --> 2680.76]  is that there's a dozen different ways to do things and from a normal person perspective i don't want
[2681.40 --> 2688.52]  a dozen different ways to do the same thing i don't want that i want one good fast way maybe an
[2688.52 --> 2693.96]  alternate way in the event that that way is not working like you know looking at you finder you
[2693.96 --> 2697.88]  know how you know you can't manually refresh the contents of a folder in finder because it should
[2697.88 --> 2702.52]  just work yeah it should but sometimes it doesn't doesn't and it needs a refresh button apple anyway
[2702.52 --> 2711.56]  the point is um i pointed that out like i found something that drove me you know really bananas uh and
[2711.56 --> 2716.52]  i pointed out that microsoft has actually done an astonishingly bad job of that they started
[2716.52 --> 2723.96]  transitioning to their new style control panel with windows 8. windows 8 was when they started
[2723.96 --> 2729.72]  transitioning to remember the new control panel yeah when did when did windows 8 come out windows 8
[2729.72 --> 2740.68]  release it's like 2008 or something 2012 okay 2012 this was a nine years ago nine years ago windows came out
[2740.68 --> 2750.44]  with this new control panel there is still core functionality in windows 11 nine years later
[2750.44 --> 2755.96]  that you have to go into the classic control panel for so make up your mind microsoft do we do it this
[2755.96 --> 2761.00]  way or do we do it that way just let me have the classic control panel in my opinion but yeah exactly
[2761.00 --> 2766.52]  well that's a whole that's a whole separate conversation i ran into another thing where i had just like i i
[2766.52 --> 2771.56]  signed into steam and all my like friend requests and crap popped up in the bottom right corner
[2772.12 --> 2777.24]  and i couldn't see anything in the bottom right corner or click on anything until it went away
[2777.24 --> 2783.24]  like yeah this is a terrible experience it happens to be exactly the same terrible experience on windows
[2783.24 --> 2788.68]  i haven't tried it on 11 yet but on windows 10 it's exactly the same way if you get like a handful of
[2788.68 --> 2793.96]  notifications at a time it's limited i think it's three and then they go away and then there's not
[2793.96 --> 2798.52]  enough time to click on and it stacks back up again and you just can't click anything in your
[2798.52 --> 2803.96]  system tray until they're gone it's yeah it's horrible it's it's like it's like the people using
[2803.96 --> 2808.76]  it never it's like the people designing the product never used it it's that kind of thing like i searched
[2808.76 --> 2815.08]  for this is great i searched for explorer okay in the start menu of one of our ingest stations to shoot
[2815.08 --> 2822.92]  a completely unrelated video yesterday and get this get guess what the the top highlighted best match was
[2823.96 --> 2830.60]  well okay first of all what do you think i wanted i i'm assuming you wanted like actually i don't know
[2830.60 --> 2836.76]  why would you search explorer explorer yeah well what what what like what do you think i might have
[2836.76 --> 2844.44]  been trying to do my my brain immediately jumped to like uh the the starting web browser but that's edge
[2844.44 --> 2850.92]  these days so file explorer but i wanted file explorer okay okay and it should come up with that because
[2850.92 --> 2854.84]  explorer the web browser doesn't exist anymore so file explorer should be the first thing that comes
[2854.84 --> 2863.56]  up so it comes up with microsoft edge okay so somebody manually intervened clearly manually intervened
[2863.56 --> 2869.48]  in the search results and said nope nope that thing that is an exact character for character match
[2870.20 --> 2876.84]  is not the best match it's this other thing it's this thing that we really want you to use please use it
[2876.84 --> 2884.12]  please please use edge please use edge we're gonna we're gonna re-engineer how uh open width preferences
[2884.12 --> 2892.36]  work to make it way harder to not use it please use it please use it i mean it's it's infuriating um
[2893.16 --> 2899.48]  and so i guess yeah i haven't been reminded i haven't found so much things that are so much better with
[2899.48 --> 2904.92]  linux as i found things that are also horrible about windows but that i just didn't really think about
[2904.92 --> 2909.08]  because i glide right through them like okay here's something that has bothered me on the particular
[2909.08 --> 2913.32]  desktop environment i'm using when you click the button that clears away all your windows and takes
[2913.32 --> 2919.00]  you to the desktop okay okay when you click that it does what you would expect okay and then if you
[2919.00 --> 2926.12]  if you alt tab and like find something you want and click it it brings everything back oh okay like
[2927.24 --> 2934.04]  who thought this was what i would want to do i i just i've i've had two things so far that i actually
[2934.04 --> 2942.76]  liked a lot one of them was the the media control area sure i've really really like it um like
[2942.76 --> 2948.36]  something that i enjoy quite a bit is sometimes when you have something playing in a browser tab you
[2948.36 --> 2953.80]  and i both have some some issues when it comes to browser tabs yes um sometimes it can be kind of
[2953.80 --> 2959.40]  hard to find it yeah and like if if i restored all my tabs and then it's like buried somewhere like
[2959.40 --> 2965.40]  it can actually be a serious pain um and yes there's the little speaker symbol on the tab but
[2965.40 --> 2971.96]  yep when you're when you got a lot of tabs open it's pretty small and you know um so this one will
[2971.96 --> 2977.64]  show you the different media things that are playing in the sound control panel right and you can just
[2977.64 --> 2982.04]  pause play do whatever you want individually right there that's pretty cool i really like it it also if you
[2982.04 --> 2989.24]  had like some native app like say shop or not shopify spotify yeah or one that's looking locally
[2989.24 --> 2994.20]  those all the controls for it would be available in there as well that's pretty cool next song pause
[2994.20 --> 2999.16]  everything and then the other thing that i really liked was during the installation of the operating
[2999.16 --> 3007.00]  system instead of like asking if the operating system can steal your data in 47 different ways yeah it
[3007.00 --> 3014.44]  it just had essentially a like hey if you want to do productivity things check out these apps for
[3014.44 --> 3019.48]  these things right if you want to play games check out these apps i like how easy it was to encrypt my
[3019.48 --> 3025.16]  drive that yeah and install yeah why isn't that just an install option on windows i mean microsoft you're
[3025.16 --> 3031.72]  the only major operating system left that doesn't just have a quick and easy way to encrypt your boot
[3031.72 --> 3039.80]  drive when you install the operating system ios android linux and mac os all prompt you like right
[3039.80 --> 3045.16]  when you're setting them up in fact ios and android it's encrypted by default now like it's it's ridiculous
[3045.16 --> 3052.84]  now my um volume uh panel is not as good as yours i think uh i i noticed a problem with it almost
[3052.84 --> 3058.20]  immediately because i have so many audio devices on my computer yeah um that when i went to scroll
[3058.20 --> 3063.00]  through them with my mouse wheel because the the indicator to move it manually is like this little
[3063.00 --> 3071.40]  tiny thing uh i started immediately moving the the sliders so the scroll wheel does both yeah move
[3071.40 --> 3077.16]  like tilting or not tilting but like rolling through all the uh interfaces and also adjusting the sliders
[3077.16 --> 3081.40]  so it's like impossible to use our layouts are so different that wouldn't even be possible on mine
[3081.40 --> 3087.64]  i the the thing that i really liked like really really liked yeah about that like they it was a slideshow
[3088.36 --> 3090.44]  essentially a suggestion slideshow yeah is
[3094.04 --> 3099.32]  the the new user experience there is so strong because if i if i'm genuinely a fresh user to linux
[3099.32 --> 3104.52]  yeah i probably did some amount of research yeah or not what if you just want to play video games you
[3104.52 --> 3108.92]  also might have done none right you don't want to pay for windows unless it's that simple i actually
[3108.92 --> 3118.52]  really like a lot of them but the application names are often quite different yeah i i uh i wanted to
[3118.52 --> 3125.00]  open something and it's like would you like to use kate yeah and i'm like what is kate yeah like i have
[3125.00 --> 3129.32]  to i had to google it yeah on windows it's like would you like to use notepad don't pay that's pretty
[3129.32 --> 3134.44]  self-explanatory really straightforward yeah yeah so what i really really liked about that yeah was it
[3134.44 --> 3139.16]  went through basically all the standard things that you'd use your computer for yeah and it gave
[3139.16 --> 3145.40]  you like these are i don't know not necessarily the best but in a lot of situations pre-installed
[3145.40 --> 3151.48]  options or very easy to acquire and use things that you can do yeah to get this really genuinely
[3151.48 --> 3156.60]  wide range of things done right i actually thought that was awesome because if i was a new user i would
[3156.60 --> 3162.84]  have very likely either written that down or taken pictures um but like been way more prepared
[3162.84 --> 3167.56]  genuinely way more prepared to actually use linux than i would have before that slideshow
[3168.44 --> 3173.72]  floatplane chats freaking out they figured out what desktop environment i'm in well guys wait for the
[3173.72 --> 3179.48]  video because there's definitely still going to be surprises luke actually knows one of the surprises
[3179.48 --> 3184.36]  that is going to be in the video because i couldn't help it i was like messaging him at midnight i'm
[3184.36 --> 3191.48]  like have you ever seen anything this wild genuinely no actually which is pretty crazy
[3192.84 --> 3198.84]  it was absolutely wild okay can can we talk about kate for a second sure because the reason i was
[3198.84 --> 3203.88]  using kate was because i wanted to download a script from github that i wanted to run
[3205.24 --> 3210.84]  can i just say for a moment that no offense development community but the fact that on github
[3211.40 --> 3218.52]  a script doesn't just download in a text format is the stupidest thing i have ever seen
[3218.52 --> 3225.88]  you know acquiring things off of github is a little weird it's actually brain dead yeah that when you
[3225.88 --> 3234.44]  download a script it downloads as an html file and then the best part is that on linux file extensions
[3234.44 --> 3241.32]  don't mean file extensions file extensions mean a helpful little hint about what might be inside it
[3241.32 --> 3249.00]  so it's literally got a text file or like a script file i forget what the extension is extension but
[3249.00 --> 3256.60]  when you try to actually run the script it's like this is an html file i'm like why is this an html file
[3256.60 --> 3262.84]  why is it that the way that i acquire this script is to copy paste it into kate and then save it as that
[3262.84 --> 3269.00]  extension and then run it why is it so ass backwards everyone's calling you stupid because you didn't click
[3269.00 --> 3274.84]  get raw um but it's it's just it's one of those things that are it's just it's a it's a user
[3274.84 --> 3280.84]  experience thing right like if if you're if you're used if you're very used to github yeah it's not a
[3280.84 --> 3286.28]  big deal but if you're if you're a new user to github it is it is genuinely an odd experience to
[3287.00 --> 3295.24]  get things from github it is oh that's great so so here here okay so here okay so raw does i still have
[3295.24 --> 3302.12]  to copy paste it what are you talking about unless you write i guess you could right click and right
[3302.12 --> 3309.16]  click and save link as save link as sh file okay is that going to be a proper script or is that just
[3309.16 --> 3313.08]  going to be another html file a long time but i think it should be okay yeah i don't know i for i
[3313.08 --> 3320.44]  forget how i ended up actually downloading it um people are saying like or curl w get the link etc etc
[3320.44 --> 3326.20]  yeah sure the problem with a lot of this stuff is you have to know yes you have to already know
[3326.20 --> 3331.72]  and if you don't already know that it's not obvious a very difficult thing to get across in
[3331.72 --> 3337.72]  this video because a very large amount of people will just not accept that i know i know and it's
[3337.72 --> 3343.80]  like it's like back to uh back to rich 77's comment we're here for you we're here for you until you do
[3343.80 --> 3348.68]  something not exactly the way that we think you should do it but the reality of it is guys is
[3348.68 --> 3354.92]  developers do not get to pick how users interact with their product and there's a lot of stuff like
[3354.92 --> 3360.12]  i was looking up potential solutions to um a couple problems that weren't like
[3362.28 --> 3367.64]  it was it was where the user experience wasn't like kind of a hundred percent up to par with what
[3367.64 --> 3371.48]  i would want it wasn't that it wasn't working yeah it's that i could i thought it could probably
[3371.48 --> 3378.04]  work better maybe if i did some work on it um and through googling almost all of the solutions that i
[3378.04 --> 3384.52]  found were telling people to go it's like here's a link to the home page of the wiki for this thing
[3384.52 --> 3391.88]  yeah go have fun which you know what if i'm in a tinkering mindset fantastic yep but if i just want
[3391.88 --> 3397.88]  to play my video game right now not fantastic not great uh well this was a really good one uh i found
[3397.88 --> 3406.52]  a guide for how to fix something and it was like okay run this script like how how do i run a script i have
[3406.52 --> 3413.96]  never i've never run a script on linux before and yeah if i can't even manage to get a properly
[3413.96 --> 3421.00]  formatted script file because i keep downloading it as an html even though the extension the extension
[3421.00 --> 3428.92]  was sh but it wouldn't run because it was an html file hidden inside it that is not intuitive i mean
[3428.92 --> 3436.36]  it's surprising to me that engineers and like science i would think science-minded people would
[3436.36 --> 3442.04]  think a label should not mean what a label is how could you possibly defend that
[3443.96 --> 3449.48]  defend a file extension that is not descriptive of what the crap the file is i haven't experienced
[3449.48 --> 3458.44]  this problem so like i'm not i'm not really sure um lmao making me face palm there's a lot of comments
[3458.44 --> 3463.08]  like that there's a lot of comments that are like rtfm and it's like yeah but the the whole point of
[3463.08 --> 3468.20]  what we're currently analyzing is the new user experience and people don't want to have to sit
[3468.20 --> 3475.16]  down and bust out the manual when they use a new thing yeah and it's way better these days sure even
[3475.16 --> 3481.00]  compared to i think the last time that i that i ran linux seriously was probably four years ago yeah
[3481.72 --> 3489.08]  it's already way better and like i i genuinely think that uh at least the distro that i'm using
[3489.72 --> 3495.88]  is outpacing what i think windows is currently doing i i genuinely think that i think they're moving
[3495.88 --> 3500.76]  faster i think they're they're gaining features faster i think they're they're they're on a really
[3500.76 --> 3506.60]  good pace but in terms of user experience especially new user experience they are definitely
[3506.60 --> 3512.28]  clearly behind hyper crusher says that's user error for not knowing how to use github no it's not
[3513.32 --> 3520.20]  it's absolutely not believe it or not believe it or not there's a whole wide world of people out there
[3520.20 --> 3525.40]  that have trouble figuring out where to find the photo they just took on their iphone let alone how to
[3525.40 --> 3531.32]  use github and as long as you hold on to that mentality that those people should just learn
[3531.32 --> 3537.16]  better linux adoption is going to be very very difficult and out of reach that's just the cold
[3537.16 --> 3542.36]  hard truth and you cannot like it and you can sit and be angry about it or whatever but that that's it
[3542.36 --> 3547.96]  that's it the truth just doesn't it is what it is and you can accept it you cannot accept it it's that
[3547.96 --> 3555.16]  simple and there can always be distros that are distros and desktop environments whatever that are
[3555.16 --> 3561.72]  much more noob friendly and ones that are really hardcore like i think i think a a uh pretty genuine
[3561.72 --> 3566.60]  user error would be to like oh i've never used linux before and i'm not even very familiar with
[3566.60 --> 3571.88]  computers at all i'm gonna go to arch like the whole internet did not tell you to do that no nobody
[3571.88 --> 3577.08]  told you one extremely simple google search would have told you to specifically not do that yeah so like
[3577.08 --> 3583.96]  sure figure it out but there are desktop environments and distros etc that advertise
[3583.96 --> 3588.36]  themselves as user-friendly and they're getting a lot better and in a lot of ways they are but
[3588.36 --> 3592.84]  they're not a hundred percent yeah gremlin injector put it really well people are missing this uh normal
[3592.84 --> 3601.24]  users are not technical yeah file extensions already are a pretty technical concept for most people i mean
[3601.96 --> 3606.92]  here here this is this is actually a really uh this is kind of gonna put us on a bit of a tangent here
[3606.92 --> 3613.96]  but i was reading an interesting article where a professor was not complaining but noticing um
[3614.52 --> 3620.36]  talking about opening up a discussion about that many of the students coming through their classes
[3620.36 --> 3624.92]  were not familiar with the concept of a folder structure like a folder tree
[3624.92 --> 3631.72]  and i kind of i kind of went what i mean this is a generation of people that have spent their
[3631.72 --> 3638.44]  yeah they've grown up their whole lives surrounded by electronics uh how and computers how is it that
[3638.44 --> 3644.92]  they could powerful search powerful search exactly uh but even so you can you can sit there and be
[3644.92 --> 3651.40]  elitist and go not knowing how to use github is user error or you can recognize that these are this and
[3651.40 --> 3656.60]  we're talking these are people in university and again you can go well just because someone's in
[3656.60 --> 3662.52]  university doesn't mean that they're more educated well actually it means that statistically speaking
[3662.52 --> 3668.52]  they are probably more educated than the people who are not maybe just not in this particular maybe
[3668.52 --> 3673.00]  not in this particular way believe it or not there's a whole wide world out there of other things that
[3673.00 --> 3680.68]  people spend their time and energy on what what right i know it's crazy right and so it's not that
[3680.68 --> 3688.04]  mind-blowing even though for me it was this utterly alien concept for someone to not actually have a
[3688.04 --> 3694.36]  very good understanding of the folder structure because even the fact like it reminds me of how you
[3694.36 --> 3698.36]  know there's that anecdote that's been floating around who knows if it's actually true where the kid
[3698.36 --> 3704.60]  asks their dad why they have a 3d printed save button you know when they find a floppy disk right
[3705.24 --> 3715.16]  the very concept of a folder structure is archaic when's the last time you had a folder inside nested
[3715.16 --> 3722.68]  inside a folder with a bunch of files in it right like that that's very 1980s that's that's that's uh
[3722.68 --> 3731.24]  that's a four that is 40 years ago right when that that idea of paper filing just being a fact of life
[3731.24 --> 3737.16]  that everyone is familiar with was a thing i mean when i was a kid we still had uh phone numbers were
[3737.16 --> 3744.44]  still kept in a rolodex right yeah and so this this concept this this tack tactile experience of
[3745.16 --> 3749.88]  rifling through things to find things that you were looking for was very much a part of my childhood but
[3749.88 --> 3756.36]  we've got an entire generation of people that just search for stuff yep and you don't get to pick
[3757.00 --> 3764.04]  how the world uses things i think a really good example here is tarfif101 on on floatplane said
[3764.52 --> 3768.92]  uh and he's talking about github yeah he said no it really is user error because there is and then in
[3768.92 --> 3773.56]  all capitals no download button for individual files you just did some really weird special stuff
[3773.56 --> 3778.52]  like probably saving the entire web page which is just as dumb as saving a youtube page to try to get the
[3778.52 --> 3786.28]  video a few messages further down ferna 182 i'm a developer and the whole save link as on github and
[3786.28 --> 3791.48]  then getting the html inside of what i thought was the actual thing i was trying to download happened
[3791.48 --> 3797.32]  to me way more times than i'm willing to admit of course it did it's just weird it's not a fantastic
[3797.32 --> 3802.84]  user experience it's not acquiring things off of github is weird i couldn't find a download button so my
[3802.84 --> 3809.24]  natural work around was save link as no i didn't save the entire web page why would how would i even
[3809.24 --> 3816.60]  do that we're talking about mistakes that uh a technical but not developer person could make i don't
[3816.60 --> 3824.84]  think most people are trying to download the entire web page they're not uh but right click save save link as
[3824.84 --> 3831.56]  is a pretty decent work around when for whatever reason you you can't find the working download button or
[3831.56 --> 3837.16]  or like downloads not working or or you want it to go faster uh and there's like a delay if you like
[3837.16 --> 3841.48]  click through it's a site you use all the time and they have one of those like five four three two one
[3841.48 --> 3845.48]  things like there it's just it's a workaround that people might be expected to be familiar with
[3845.48 --> 3851.32]  so he he then replies to to us saying this but that's how browsers work not how github works
[3852.36 --> 3857.72]  examine all of the comments around your message yeah that's that's the way i'm gonna answer that you've
[3857.72 --> 3862.60]  been you've been roasted as much as you need to be roasted you're you're you're you're cooked enough
[3862.60 --> 3868.52]  we go any further and uh yeah we're good that that turkey's gonna be burned not uh not juicy anymore
[3868.52 --> 3873.56]  the answer is add a download button the answer is why isn't there a download button and why wasn't
[3873.56 --> 3879.96]  there a download button many years ago that's the answer way more obvious yeah oh man anyways it's
[3879.96 --> 3886.28]  mind-blowing we should probably uh mind blow talking about some sponsors real quick uh but
[3886.28 --> 3892.60]  just hilariously vindicating that i talk about all these reactions that we're gonna get from the linux
[3892.60 --> 3899.32]  community and we've got a lot of people saying no no no no it'll be fine it'll be fine and the second
[3899.32 --> 3906.12]  i come out and be a human be vulnerable and say i didn't know something and that i made a mistake
[3906.12 --> 3916.12]  you've got these toxic members of this community jumping jumping down my throat like ready to pounce
[3916.12 --> 3921.72]  and it's like i get it i get it you're an expert and you feel like everyone should be an expert in
[3921.72 --> 3928.36]  this might be your baby yeah sure your baby isn't perfect but the thing is like i don't know man see
[3928.36 --> 3932.92]  for me and this is you know we're getting into like relationships again right like where we i think
[3932.92 --> 3937.64]  we've talked about this on the show today it's like i never tell my wife you're the most beautiful
[3937.64 --> 3942.76]  woman in the world lots of husbands tell their wives that and i'm sitting here going well i'm not
[3942.76 --> 3948.84]  gonna lie to you like you're not i'm also not the best looking guy in the world don't have the biggest
[3948.84 --> 3955.24]  long like so what so what the package you're asian you don't even need me to have the biggest
[3955.24 --> 3965.08]  job okay that's not the fitment is fantastic yeah see right the margins here are amazing what i'll
[3965.08 --> 3975.00]  say is it seems like we were built for each other so the point is the point is that if you love
[3975.00 --> 3982.04]  something i feel like you should be able to be honest with it that's and and i think that the kind
[3982.04 --> 3990.28]  of love that is fanatical that is not objective is not actually as um it's not actually as fulfilling
[3990.28 --> 3995.40]  like i was reading an article about like 17 things a boss should never say to an employee and one of
[3995.40 --> 4000.84]  them was good job and there's a reason for that and the justification for it was actually very well
[4000.84 --> 4006.12]  thought out it's because it's not specific it's vague what what was good what was good about it how
[4006.12 --> 4011.32]  good was it it doesn't tell you anything good job but you have to follow it with why there has to be
[4011.32 --> 4018.04]  context there has to be context so you you you can't there's no point lying to people and if you
[4018.04 --> 4025.64]  just say everything is great your words mean nothing you you lose all the gravity that the sentiments you
[4025.64 --> 4032.44]  express could have possibly had if you just constantly talk about how great something is and i i get i take a
[4032.44 --> 4038.52]  lot of flack for being super negative you know like i'll see people oh linus complains about everything but
[4038.52 --> 4046.92]  but so what we also don't yeah well that's a whole that's a whole separate that's a whole separate
[4046.92 --> 4051.40]  conversation i mean and a lot of the time when i complain about something it's just the thing that
[4051.40 --> 4055.48]  makes me really angry it's not when something is bad the thing that makes me angry is when something
[4055.48 --> 4062.20]  is bad out of complete and utter negligence or malice so the fact that the iphone doesn't have t9 dialing
[4062.20 --> 4066.60]  when it's literally something that an apple developer could build in less than a week and would require
[4068.52 --> 4076.52]  it's it's it's an insult to their users like it's just it it's utterly unbelievable um i think there's
[4076.52 --> 4082.44]  also i think there's a lot of if you aren't just lying all the time or saying things that you're
[4082.44 --> 4090.36]  entirely unqualified to say like if you had truly done an assessment of all like appropriate aged
[4090.36 --> 4096.36]  partners that you could have in the world that would be ridiculous and i probably not an attractive
[4096.36 --> 4100.52]  trait for a woman i was just gonna say she might not even want to be with you yeah i tried out i
[4100.52 --> 4106.52]  tried out every lady in our geographical area and you're the best no you said world this would be a
[4106.52 --> 4112.76]  big project yeah a big project major um like man you'd need to drink a lot of fluids get a lot of
[4112.76 --> 4118.84]  chicken soup going this is a this is a weird topic to go to yeah it's a weird wansha um but i i think if
[4118.84 --> 4127.00]  you if you focus on things that are true and you can fully qualify they mean more because there's that
[4127.00 --> 4134.60]  whole concept where like oh like you ask your your your partner if you like look good in something and
[4134.60 --> 4142.12]  then they say yes and you go and you go ask like your buddy because you might get a you're worried that
[4142.12 --> 4148.60]  the response from your partner is is is colored right yep it's it's rose tinted glasses whatever
[4148.60 --> 4154.28]  so if you if you are more straight up honest and clear and objective then those compliments mean
[4154.28 --> 4159.24]  more because you know they're legit i think there's value to that for better for worse my wife knows
[4159.24 --> 4165.00]  that if she makes food that isn't very good tasting i'll tell her because she's the kind of
[4165.00 --> 4170.44]  person who genuinely cares about self-improvement and in the same way if i she probably doesn't want to
[4170.44 --> 4174.76]  waste her time if she's cooking food for you if you don't want to cook something that if i set up
[4174.76 --> 4180.52]  i mean okay so hopefully so let's talk about one of my jobs around the house if i set up the uh you
[4180.52 --> 4187.56]  know the uh the universal remote for our media system and it's in a way that she can't it's annoying
[4187.56 --> 4192.68]  like it's annoying to use or it takes too long or whatever else she's not going to just you know grin
[4192.68 --> 4198.12]  and bear it quietly exactly she's going to tell me so that i can fix it because we want to improve
[4198.12 --> 4201.88]  each other's lives more overall and deeper appreciation we're in it to win it right like
[4201.88 --> 4206.12]  we're on the same team um so you have to be able to be you have to be able to be honest with each
[4206.12 --> 4213.40]  other luke please don't make this worse sorry dude this is so this is so great nh4x4 tracker says most
[4213.40 --> 4218.36]  people don't care about t9 here's another comment a little bit further down thorium220 says i started
[4218.36 --> 4224.36]  using t9 dialing on android because linus mentioned it in a video thanks mate this is great most people don't
[4224.36 --> 4230.36]  understand what it is that's why they don't think it's amazing that is the only reason to not think
[4230.36 --> 4236.52]  it's amazing it is actually the fastest way to dial a phone number hands down other than if you have your
[4236.52 --> 4240.92]  your nine favorites or whatever and you just hold one button that is the only way that i can think of
[4240.92 --> 4250.68]  that could be faster just makes me very very angry very angry um that's not the best example of
[4250.68 --> 4255.56]  something that is just sort of utter negligence that it's not included i think probably a better
[4255.56 --> 4261.80]  example would be something like uh accessibility and right to repair like hiding screws under a
[4261.80 --> 4270.04]  sticker that is destroyed when you remove it over nothing over absolutely nothing uh is is far more
[4270.04 --> 4275.64]  um hostile to the user than not having a feature that i personally think is great and so do a lot of
[4275.64 --> 4280.92]  people let's go ahead and get into our next sponsor here i swear to you i'm gonna i'm gonna get through

[4362.60 --> 4366.28]  what else do we want to talk about today i feel like we got a little bit derailed there's someone
[4366.28 --> 4372.76]  in the float plane chat asking for help finding a file uh in ubuntu gnome file explorer i find that
[4373.88 --> 4381.88]  very funny um but let's let's continue uh good guy microsoft let's uh funny timing for that topic
[4381.88 --> 4386.28]  what microsoft sorry microsoft oh yeah sure microsoft agrees to independent third-party
[4386.28 --> 4391.80]  study looking at right to repair uh i will also point out that a lot of floatplane people pointed
[4391.80 --> 4397.08]  out that it's very funny that one of the difficulties that you've been having with linux is github because
[4397.08 --> 4403.32]  microsoft owns github that is quite entertaining well okay i didn't to be clear i didn't say it was an
[4403.32 --> 4408.52]  issue with linux so my issue with linux was that it wasn't obvious where to like put a script to run it
[4408.52 --> 4416.20]  right yeah like i would you have needed that script on windows no it's part of the experience
[4417.00 --> 4423.64]  okay okay i guess that's fair i would argue like finding scripts online to do things for you is
[4423.64 --> 4430.20]  is probably part of the experience yeah it shouldn't be um expecting the average user to run a script i
[4430.20 --> 4435.24]  mean the problem with scripts is there's such an enormous like security problem too because just
[4435.24 --> 4440.68]  copying and pasting scripts off the internet to be clear like i'm doing it but you shouldn't that's
[4440.68 --> 4448.44]  not that's not a good best practice again that's the kind of crazy sort of um i don't know what to
[4448.44 --> 4457.24]  call it is it double speak is it uh uh it's one of the the most contradictory things about uh the linux
[4457.24 --> 4462.52]  community is that out of on this on the one hand it's like it's open source it's all about security and
[4462.52 --> 4469.16]  privacy and and all of these sort of pillars a lot of that is is genuinely okay and on the other hand
[4469.16 --> 4474.52]  it's like the only way to do basic stuff is to unless you are an extremely technical user like a
[4474.52 --> 4479.00]  part-time developer is to download random scripts off the internet and execute them in a terminal as
[4479.00 --> 4484.92]  a super user like are you serious a lot a lot of the security stuff is that you assess that that script
[4484.92 --> 4490.28]  and that i know i know i know i know i'm just saying i'm just saying i know
[4494.04 --> 4502.20]  that's like saying the safest car is the one that you just build yourself like most people shouldn't
[4502.20 --> 4510.44]  build a car like like i don't want to spoil this too much oh no but just for some context remember
[4510.44 --> 4520.76]  the screenshot i sent you no i'm sorry you're supposed to be a security professional every user
[4520.76 --> 4524.28]  should be a digital security professional
[4527.48 --> 4535.24]  oh no um they're gonna hate us it's gonna be a problem i'm trying honestly my experience so far has
[4535.24 --> 4540.84]  been pretty clean um oh my goodness remember when you were you sent me the videos of the problem yeah
[4540.84 --> 4549.16]  and i sent you the screenshot back um yeah yes so they're expecting you to read all that i know i know
[4549.16 --> 4556.04]  the funny part is you saw how far i scrolled through that right like there's a lot but they're expecting
[4556.04 --> 4562.04]  you to read it that's like that's like literally literally the i forget if it made it all the way to
[4562.04 --> 4568.12]  the supreme court but like literally the american judicial system has decided that eulahs are not
[4568.12 --> 4574.76]  enforceable because nobody reads anything that long and that includes agreeing to things
[4576.68 --> 4582.92]  when you're executing basically any scenario a lot of people too long didn't read even if it's only a
[4582.92 --> 4588.28]  few lines and sometimes it's a lot more than a few lines so i don't know anyways good guy microsoft
[4588.28 --> 4593.32]  this has nothing to do with linux uh microsoft is taking concrete steps to facilitate independent
[4593.32 --> 4599.96]  repair of its devices following pressure from shareholders this comes after months of negotiations
[4599.96 --> 4606.92]  started in june when investor advocacy non-profit as you so filed a shareholder resolution in regards to
[4606.92 --> 4613.32]  right to repair and environmental concerns microsoft will study how increasing access to parts and info can
[4613.32 --> 4619.32]  reduce contributions to climate change and e-waste which does i will say sound like a very new
[4619.32 --> 4624.52]  microsoft thing that sounds like something new microsoft would do so it's kind of in yeah that
[4624.52 --> 4629.96]  sounds like something that new microsoft probably should have figured out in two seconds instead of
[4629.96 --> 4635.00]  um spending months on it and needing an independent third party commission i agree let's let's talk about
[4635.00 --> 4641.72]  all the wasted resources of a third party investigation being done when you could just do the right thing
[4641.72 --> 4648.44]  immediately but i'm sure they could figure it out i'm sure they could call lewis one time and lewis would
[4648.44 --> 4653.08]  happily get there like immediately and walk through how they could do all of this i'm pretty sure that they
[4653.08 --> 4663.32]  could sit and turn off the tv and for like four seconds sit and think and they could probably come
[4663.32 --> 4668.28]  out i don't think they have to talk to lewis about this should things be easier for end users to repair
[4668.28 --> 4670.36]  well hold on hold on i'm thinking
[4676.68 --> 4682.44]  yes yeah i did it i guess i was giving them too much credit i got there reading this line in particular
[4682.44 --> 4687.88]  we'll study how increasing access to parts and info can reduce contributions to climate change and e-waste
[4687.88 --> 4692.84]  yeah like just get over it it will it will do that thanks um remember this is the start increasing the
[4692.84 --> 4698.28]  info this is the same company for whom an ifixit repairability score of two is considered a win
[4698.84 --> 4705.48]  okay i mean we really like the um maybe we should change it from good guy microsoft to like hopefully
[4705.48 --> 4710.92]  finally getting close microsoft it's amazing to me and i mean this is one of those funny things because
[4710.92 --> 4716.20]  maybe again i'm just being a right to repair elitist assuming that other people have put the kind of
[4716.20 --> 4722.28]  thought into this that i have and maybe it just isn't obvious to other people how the same because
[4722.28 --> 4727.64]  because this this is this is like this is a company that's probably got uh you know pound for pound
[4727.64 --> 4734.60]  more genius level intellects on staff than most other almost any organization on earth other than you
[4734.60 --> 4741.48]  know like mensa right like we're talking about they well you have to be a genius to be a member of mensa don't you
[4741.48 --> 4745.72]  i don't know i mean i've never looked into membership i assumed i'm not genius enough the
[4745.72 --> 4751.88]  the point is that this this is an organization that has enough smart people in it that i don't i'm not
[4751.88 --> 4758.12]  inclined to give a lot of uh credit for them investigating this because there's absolutely no
[4758.12 --> 4763.48]  way yeah sorry i changed gears here no i was trying to play devil's advocate okay it's possible that just
[4763.48 --> 4768.76]  because they're genius level intellects that that that doesn't mean that they've given any thought to
[4768.76 --> 4774.20]  this whatsoever the issue though is that companies like microsoft and like apple are clearly putting
[4774.20 --> 4781.40]  so much thought into making repairs more difficult that they couldn't possibly have made those decisions
[4781.40 --> 4787.96]  without also examining the alternate the alternative if i can try to jump on the devil's advocate side of
[4787.96 --> 4794.20]  things i i could say that there's whatever start of it started it probably set a pretty significant
[4794.20 --> 4801.16]  amount of momentum and it's been difficult to kind of gear change and there's been no real kick to
[4801.16 --> 4806.84]  actually start that gear change and then lately there's been much more of a kick well let's let's
[4806.84 --> 4812.20]  hope let's hope we can keep some momentum here i'm hoping that's it we have not talked about the twitch leak
[4812.20 --> 4819.96]  yet okay how are we this far into the show and we have not okay we also oh my goodness this is madness
[4819.96 --> 4826.04]  we haven't even talked about how toques are back in stock ladies and gentlemen we've got new color wow
[4826.04 --> 4830.52]  did i make exactly the same face that looks like a palette swap look at this
[4833.00 --> 4839.88]  is that or is that not exactly the same picture hold on it's not the hair slightly different that is
[4839.88 --> 4848.44]  actually a different picture that's kind of amazing uh anyway the dark aqua is here we got gray we got a blue
[4848.44 --> 4853.80]  now i don't know i've ever seen any store that has as many pictures for products as the ltd you know
[4853.80 --> 4858.60]  what's the crazy part about that is that it's not even that much work like it's a lot of work and it
[4858.60 --> 4866.28]  does cost us money but it's not such a crazy amount of work that i think you know large large organizations
[4866.28 --> 4872.28]  couldn't just do it a few more yeah yeah just it doesn't seem that complicated anyway they're 1999
[4872.28 --> 4878.52]  the construction quality issues were fixed if you have one from last year um you will hear from us
[4878.52 --> 4883.64]  we'll be reaching out to all previous buyers in the next week or so and you will either get a new
[4883.64 --> 4889.48]  fixed toque or you will get a refund if you've had the issue um and you haven't yet reached out to us so
[4889.48 --> 4893.32]  we'll get it all sorted out there are thousands of you please give our support team some time to work
[4893.32 --> 4897.40]  through everything but we will get this resolved for everyone we take all this kind of stuff extremely
[4897.40 --> 4904.68]  seriously um for those of you who are wondering uh no we did not throw away the um the compromised
[4904.68 --> 4911.48]  inventory we actually had it reworked locally uh so we did not waste any beanies that's cool um they
[4911.48 --> 4918.84]  were all they were all fixed and um and then like just repacked because they're still new um cool so yeah
[4918.84 --> 4924.04]  we're getting we're getting everything sorted out all right let's talk about twitch twitch leaked the
[4924.04 --> 4931.00]  whole thing source code uh creator creator compensation apparently there could be more
[4931.00 --> 4936.44]  coming um i saw that apparently this is part one yeah i don't i don't even like at this point no
[4937.24 --> 4943.08]  what else is there what else is going to be a bunch of isos of like people's computers i i have no idea
[4943.08 --> 4949.88]  uh because it's a lot it's it's it's the source code it's it's a lot not all but a very significant
[4949.88 --> 4954.44]  amount of creator compensation it i believe it goes down to like 10 000 creators or something
[4955.08 --> 4959.32]  it's it's like one percent because there's an insane amount of twitch am i the top one percent
[4959.32 --> 4963.96]  then because i think my information was leaked nice i am the one percent i think that's what it is i'm
[4963.96 --> 4968.60]  not entirely certain i mean i became a one top one percent only fans creator in like two hours heck
[4968.60 --> 4973.56]  yeah that was pretty that was pretty fun just just flexing nice only fans flexing sorry i got to do
[4973.56 --> 4979.80]  only fans flexing got to take some clothes off is the is the male nipple thing still a thing on twitch
[4979.80 --> 4983.72]  i have no idea i have no clue i'm pretty sure we've broken it like a few yeah i'd be willing to show you
[4983.72 --> 4988.44]  guys my nipples but i don't actually need to get banned off twitch it's yeah it's it's not really a
[4988.44 --> 4993.56]  needle mover for us and i was gonna say now everyone knows how much you make yeah yeah that could be an
[4993.56 --> 4999.32]  expensive nip slip yeah exactly right yeah even though it's not a needle mover it's still expensive yeah
[4999.32 --> 5006.12]  it goes away it's a lot better than a kick in the teeth 29 000 over two years yeah um anyways 125
[5006.12 --> 5013.00]  gigabytes went into the torrent link uh that was leaked onto originally 4chan along with a paste
[5013.00 --> 5019.24]  bin i believe the paste bin the paste bin was gone by the time i got an email from luke at 5 30 a.m
[5020.04 --> 5028.60]  before you ask i've got it i've got it all i did it hot i um you did look how ready
[5029.64 --> 5038.52]  i have nothing i am good boy um the uh i think jake had it before you maybe i don't know um you got
[5038.52 --> 5044.92]  it like i still have stuxnet nice like you gotta just archive this stuff i don't know it's interesting
[5044.92 --> 5051.64]  i mean once it's gone you know it's someone in the flow plane chat said that like a big d move that twitch
[5051.64 --> 5056.12]  could and would be really interesting if they did is just go like you know what screw it just put it on
[5056.12 --> 5062.28]  github there's no way not amazon wouldn't happen but it'd be sweet that's not amazon's way yeah
[5062.28 --> 5066.60]  there's absolutely no way hands off desk i'm sorry get your heads out of the gutter
[5067.88 --> 5071.96]  i just do this when i'm sitting down i don't know why anyways muscle memory
[5075.08 --> 5080.60]  i was just waiting for you to bring it up again all right tell us what's in there twitch has confirmed the
[5080.60 --> 5085.48]  breach has taken place but denies credit card info or login details were exposed um
[5088.76 --> 5094.84]  i have heard that people claim that password data was included but was encrypted that doesn't mean
[5094.84 --> 5098.76]  that you shouldn't change your password yeah it means that you should change your password change
[5098.76 --> 5104.68]  your password for twitch just do it especially i mean everyone has a stream key i believe every twitch
[5104.68 --> 5109.64]  account is able to stream i'm pretty sure um so just make sure that you do it because you don't
[5109.64 --> 5114.44]  want someone getting access to your account details which could be attached to your name and your
[5114.44 --> 5120.04]  personal information and then streaming things on twitch that are really bad um so change it change
[5120.04 --> 5127.48]  your password very important um there was there's yeah basically source code and user information
[5127.48 --> 5133.08]  passwords stuff like that and the earnings of a lot of different creators the earnings have been discussed
[5133.08 --> 5139.48]  a lot yeah that's basically the highlight for the normies but what do developers care about
[5139.48 --> 5143.96]  there's a lot of stuff in there twitch does a lot of things yeah like what lots of stuff i just want
[5143.96 --> 5149.88]  to know what the things the developers find interesting lots of things um there's there's if you think about
[5149.88 --> 5158.12]  youtube or twitch um there's things that would be valuable to developers if they if they leaked out
[5158.12 --> 5163.88]  there's things like what the player that could be good for people i mean twitch's player is not amazing
[5163.88 --> 5168.20]  you might not want the player yeah but there could be some tech in there that's interesting there's also
[5168.20 --> 5173.72]  like pipeline improvements in terms of moving data because one of the things especially for youtube is
[5173.72 --> 5180.52]  incredibly good at this youtube is so good at this that i've talked to people that work at competitors
[5180.52 --> 5187.08]  um that have said that they never want to try to get into never want to try to genuinely compete with
[5187.08 --> 5191.48]  youtube in the vod space like they might have vod availability but they don't want to try to compete
[5191.48 --> 5199.08]  with them on the vod space because their like pipeline and data science essentially is so far beyond
[5199.08 --> 5205.56]  that they'll never get as efficient and that's the battle right um so like it's it's crazy so there's
[5206.44 --> 5210.52]  probably some of that stuff in there um there's there's there's there's everything there's everything
[5210.52 --> 5216.04]  that you would need to essentially make twitch there's also other stuff um that includes things that
[5216.04 --> 5221.32]  they never released including what people are talking about uh as a steam competitor called
[5221.32 --> 5227.00]  vapor yeah which is interesting in a few different ways partially because it includes the word vape
[5227.56 --> 5233.00]  which is like come on now and then the other one because it's so highly related to the word steam
[5233.00 --> 5238.84]  yeah which is just like really i also like that it's vaporware vapor that's pretty good
[5238.84 --> 5249.08]  uh apparently vapor will or was or will or i don't know have a 3d chat system called vape world
[5250.52 --> 5256.20]  which is like the worst thing they could have possibly called it in my opinion holy uh amazon
[5256.20 --> 5262.92]  filed the patent in 2017 titled joining games from a spectating system oh that's pretty cool sounds
[5262.92 --> 5269.56]  actually genuinely pretty cool yeah and twitch being fully like vertically integrated so uh amazon
[5269.56 --> 5276.20]  having a game studio obviously um actually imagine being able to join a battleground in new world
[5276.20 --> 5284.04]  yeah that you saw a streamer was in and remember this is aws right so i would be very surprised if
[5284.04 --> 5291.08]  the the the the end game experience wasn't something along the lines of streaming the game right not not
[5291.08 --> 5296.84]  playing on your local machine right so the entire game runs in an amazon data center somewhere you
[5296.84 --> 5304.28]  connect to it it's this enormous high performance but fully local environment with clients streaming
[5304.28 --> 5309.96]  into it everyone is able to engage with like they're able to watch in any number of ways like
[5309.96 --> 5316.28]  imagine if you could watch a battle royale but more like in a hum in a hunger game style where your
[5316.28 --> 5320.92]  camera can be anywhere right and by hunger games sorry i don't mean like the minecraft play mode
[5320.92 --> 5325.80]  i mean like the movies like like where if you could watch an arena fight but your camera could be
[5325.80 --> 5331.40]  anywhere you want like literally an unlimited practically speaking unlimited number of people
[5331.40 --> 5338.52]  could connect and either be playing or observing and how that would work with a platform like twitch
[5338.52 --> 5344.68]  like they so they've got the mechanism to draw new viewers into playing the game through through drops
[5344.68 --> 5349.00]  and through uh you know exclusive skins and they've got all the streamers that are going to be
[5349.00 --> 5352.92]  inherently promoting it because you just play whatever's biggest on the platform they can use
[5352.92 --> 5358.12]  the platform to push the game to boost it up and it all runs on aws and the whole thing is just this
[5358.12 --> 5364.60]  beautiful little bow i mean honestly you think about it that way and amazon is the bigger threat to xbox
[5364.60 --> 5371.24]  than sony is because that is potentially a completely game-changing experience you look at how much demand
[5371.24 --> 5380.28]  there is to get into what's that stupid gta 5 irl like server that everyone cares about um pixel something
[5380.28 --> 5385.96]  something pixel something something like that you look at how much demand there is to get in and
[5385.96 --> 5393.00]  participate in these types of uh it's not a pixel it's called like yeah no pixel type of like massively
[5393.00 --> 5399.24]  multiplayer but remember it's relatively small scale but this type of multiplayer experience because no pixel
[5399.24 --> 5403.72]  almost isn't even a game for a lot of the players they're they're role-playing right and
[5407.16 --> 5412.52]  i know but we can't call it a massively multiplayer online rpg it's good new slash linux okay because
[5412.52 --> 5419.72]  it's i don't think anyone's going to argue that gta 5 is an rpg game okay so yes the nope yes you could
[5419.72 --> 5427.56]  there are role-playing elements but i think we can agree that it is still a shooter adventure okay whatever
[5427.56 --> 5432.60]  i don't know what genre grand theft auto is its own genre it doesn't matter the point is the point is
[5433.16 --> 5440.20]  that you don't even have to pay streamers to play that they want to be in there because wherever the
[5440.20 --> 5445.56]  hottest personalities are all congregating is where they're going to be able to get the most access to
[5445.56 --> 5452.52]  new audiences and to increase their own subscriptions so all of a sudden the the play for twitch which
[5452.52 --> 5460.36]  clearly wasn't um motivated by twitch's spectacular profitability uh makes more sense and to be clear
[5460.36 --> 5466.84]  you know i'm not i'm not saying that twitch doesn't make any money i'm just saying compared to the billion
[5466.84 --> 5473.96]  dollars that amazon spent on it if the revenue numbers are anywhere even close to representative
[5473.96 --> 5484.28]  of what twitch is making it's not very profitable that site is there's there's these like really
[5484.28 --> 5492.52]  bit like the brand takeovers for games are huge yep yep big money yeah it's it's they'll do like whole
[5492.52 --> 5498.20]  site buys and stuff like it's it's big but a whole site buy a lot of it is going to end up paid to the
[5498.20 --> 5503.80]  streamers on these pages those banners are showing i don't think the twitch home page is exactly
[5503.80 --> 5510.36]  the hottest place to hang out you go to the streamers you like to watch so i suspect so i
[5510.36 --> 5514.68]  would i would say and you got to remember too so one of the one of the things that's really important
[5514.68 --> 5520.84]  to keep in mind is that the streamer uh income that leaked does not include donations and it does not
[5520.84 --> 5527.48]  include um what was one of the other major ones that it doesn't include brand deals shoot yeah it
[5527.48 --> 5531.64]  doesn't include brand deals but the point is twitch doesn't get a piece of brand deals unless they're
[5531.64 --> 5538.04]  acting in a in bits agency no it would probably include acting in like an and uh like an agency
[5538.04 --> 5544.28]  role for the streamer and even for donations if i recall correctly doesn't twitch take a lower
[5544.28 --> 5550.60]  cut for donations do they even take a cut for donations so they don't take donations they do bits
[5550.60 --> 5557.96]  twitch uh donations revenue share hold on how much does twitch take from donations subscriptions
[5557.96 --> 5563.80]  uh affiliates earn 50 of the sub some high-end partners keep 70 percent donations made through
[5563.80 --> 5568.44]  third-party companies such as stream labs go to the streamer so how does what's the share for bits
[5568.44 --> 5573.56]  i'm not familiar with it the point is there's a scale oh it apparently included bits so even though
[5573.56 --> 5578.20]  that doesn't tell us necessarily how much streamers are making ah it didn't include exclusivity contracts
[5578.20 --> 5585.16]  right so even though it didn't tell us how much top streamers are actually making because there could
[5585.16 --> 5592.04]  be donations bits whatever uh exclusivity deals brand deals all that other kind of stuff what it did tell
[5592.04 --> 5599.08]  us is how much twitch is making because twitch is making whatever the inverse of that number the streamers
[5599.08 --> 5605.32]  are making is and so if we're looking at the top streamers on the platform making like eight to nine
[5605.32 --> 5612.76]  million dollars over a span of it seems like about two years and then it dropping precipitously from
[5612.76 --> 5622.12]  there i mean you can basically figure out how much revenue twitch has not quite not quite there there's
[5622.12 --> 5628.76]  also yeah so like amazon wanted to own the tech to a certain degree and amazon wanted to own the watch
[5628.76 --> 5633.16]  time watch time was particularly interesting to them and i'm sure they're taking a lot of data from
[5633.16 --> 5639.08]  their users as well of course it's extremely valuable to them but there's also like aws features
[5639.08 --> 5644.76]  that have come from twitch existing within the amazon ecosystem that they then sell in that way
[5644.76 --> 5648.44]  like there's there's other ways that they've been able to profit off of there but yeah in terms of
[5648.44 --> 5653.72]  subscription revenue it is quite revealing for sure yeah i mean it's uh we're not going to build a twitch
[5653.72 --> 5658.76]  competitor even with the source code i can tell you we're not interested in building a twitch competitor
[5658.76 --> 5665.48]  already knew that yeah and and yeah having the source code makes no not only would that be intensely
[5665.48 --> 5672.20]  not okay uh but it makes no difference anyways so yeah i mean i think that it's actually kind of funny
[5672.20 --> 5678.36]  how the entire twitch source code leaked and nobody will try to clone twitch's service with their own
[5678.36 --> 5685.56]  source code i pretty much guarantee it because the the business model unless you have those supplementary
[5685.56 --> 5691.24]  businesses that you can use the technology for it's just it's not practical it's really expensive
[5691.80 --> 5700.28]  yeah yeah there's a few things uh rip mixer right like if microsoft with their much deeper uh
[5700.28 --> 5707.16]  understanding i would say even of gaming if microsoft couldn't make that aspect of the business work
[5707.88 --> 5714.52]  i mean well apparently there were a lot of issues at mixer but my point still stands it's clearly
[5714.52 --> 5720.36]  more of a challenge than just building a streaming platform you have to actually build a business
[5720.36 --> 5726.52]  around it uh epos vox is in the chat said worth noting though that twitch only pays like five to
[5726.52 --> 5733.72]  ten percent of their ad revenue for creators it's nowhere near a 50 50 split yeah okay that's fair yeah
[5733.72 --> 5738.12]  most of most of what creators are making like if you look at your how much you're making from ads on twitch it's
[5738.12 --> 5745.32]  it's not it's not a lot um a lot of it's going to be subs a lot of it's also going to be donations
[5745.32 --> 5750.04]  donations are huge like if you thought you just learned how much these streamers are actually taking
[5750.04 --> 5767.08]  away you're woefully mistaken uh but i can also uh i can also tell you that ads cpms compared to user donations is not um nothing i think ads are a very small part of this yeah ads are yeah
[5767.08 --> 5774.84]  ads are not going to be a the the game changer that you might think that they would be remember like
[5774.84 --> 5783.08]  website banner ads are sort of that's a pretty web 1.0 way to make money now twitch because they've got
[5783.08 --> 5789.48]  this super dialed in audience is going to be able to demand more than some random and twitch also facilitates
[5789.48 --> 5796.04]  a lot of like okay like every major fps player is going to play this new game that came out we're going to be
[5796.04 --> 5800.36]  the in-between between you and all these streamers yeah and it's going to be this huge absolutely
[5800.36 --> 5805.72]  genuinely massive amounts of money transferring hands yes um because they're buying out like i said
[5805.72 --> 5811.32]  like every major gamer yeah even non-fps gamers like everyone on twitch is going to be playing i think apex
[5811.32 --> 5814.92]  was one of them right there's been a lot of games that are like that that had like essentially no
[5814.92 --> 5820.04]  marketing but on launch dates like every twitch person is playing it yeah and you know they're paid to
[5820.04 --> 5824.28]  play it because they're like we're going to be playing this game from exactly this time to exactly this time
[5824.28 --> 5830.44]  and then going back to regular content it's like oh okay um widget says microsoft understands gaming
[5831.88 --> 5840.04]  microsoft owns xbox box yeah microsoft pioneered cross-platform licenses for games that's that's a
[5840.04 --> 5844.12]  pretty understands gamers and understands gaming move right there yeah they don't get everything right
[5844.12 --> 5850.20]  100 definitely not definitely not but they're they're definitely not complete idiots when it comes to
[5850.20 --> 5857.40]  engaging with the gaming community nope that's uh that's xbox one launch microsoft that microsoft is
[5857.40 --> 5864.76]  gone it's a media you want to watch football it's like you're gonna play games like this connect
[5866.44 --> 5873.56]  that was an entertaining launch oh yeah pathartal says microsoft developed direct x lmao
[5873.56 --> 5879.88]  yeah they they know a thing or two they because they've seen her thing a thing or two yeah they've
[5879.88 --> 5884.44]  been around they've been around the block um speaking of a group that's been around the block
[5884.44 --> 5889.16]  facebook had a bit of a bad week oh are we going to talk about that uh we don't talk about it for too
[5889.16 --> 5892.84]  long yeah sure let's go fast because there's a couple things that i still i still want to talk
[5892.84 --> 5897.32]  about oled switch and my team viewer saga okay we can go over this really quick they were down for i
[5897.32 --> 5902.84]  think it was like six hours uh publications estimated facebook lost somewhere between 60 and 100 million
[5903.56 --> 5909.40]  the outage epic um what was really great so like whatsapp instagram facebook all of it was down
[5909.96 --> 5915.08]  building access was also down because it's tied into the facebook platform so they couldn't get
[5915.08 --> 5922.20]  back in to like fix it i have heard i that's like verified this but i have heard that they had to like
[5922.20 --> 5928.44]  contact someone who had an angle grinder to like cut them into the building so they could fix it
[5928.44 --> 5933.32]  hilarious which is amazing that's all we don't even have to go into it way more than that but just like
[5933.32 --> 5939.64]  so funny um all right i want to talk about the oled switch okay have you seen it in person yet no
[5940.44 --> 5945.72]  it's that even even been possible didn't you guys get like a no we didn't get an early unit i think
[5945.72 --> 5952.92]  it's like on store shelves right now oh okay yeah love you nintendo but you you do a lot of things weird
[5953.48 --> 5958.60]  um they tried to work with us for a little bit there yeah no they we did get one from nintendo oh just
[5958.60 --> 5965.08]  just like just like like a week and a half after like austin uploaded his video i'm like nice okay
[5965.08 --> 5970.20]  sweet i mean you know what honestly i can see why console makers do prioritize him he hits
[5970.76 --> 5976.60]  oh no he does a great consoles yeah um but i actually don't think that was like an organized
[5976.60 --> 5978.84]  strategy i think it was just nintendo being
[5978.84 --> 5987.88]  just being nintendo a little bit yeah um so i tried it the bigger screen so much better like
[5987.88 --> 5994.12]  actually uh like i'm looking at it going i haven't touched breath of the wild since i beat it i'm like
[5994.92 --> 6000.20]  i need to jump back into i need to jump back into hyrule here i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna play some more
[6000.20 --> 6006.44]  breath of the wild um definitely i didn't try the new metroid game but i'm definitely gonna play it
[6006.44 --> 6013.88]  i've got a code in my inbox so i'll check that out and i had a lot of concerns about blowing up the
[6013.88 --> 6019.88]  size of the screen while maintaining 720p resolution i shouldn't say a lot of concerns i had some concerns
[6020.60 --> 6030.28]  it's okay it's okay it's okay it's fine i am disappointed surprised it's it's like i know you're
[6030.28 --> 6034.44]  saying it's okay but i'm surprised it's that bad i thought it was honestly gonna make not much of a
[6034.44 --> 6037.96]  difference it's not that bad okay well the thing is it doesn't make a huge difference it's just that
[6037.96 --> 6043.64]  if you have sharp eyes you probably already weren't a huge fan of the 720p display yeah and the good news
[6043.64 --> 6053.48]  is that it's 720p rgb not pentile so if it was 720p but a pentile sub-pixel arrangement i i i was
[6053.48 --> 6062.76]  concerned about that but it's an rgb oled panel and it looks pretty darn good um the biggest disappointment
[6062.76 --> 6069.00]  for me i think is that the rumored technology they're working on with nvidia to use dlss like
[6069.00 --> 6077.16]  to use machine learning upscaling did not make it into this model what i wonder is if the rumored
[6077.16 --> 6084.52]  switch pro just isn't this if this is the new base model they upgraded it in some way so that they
[6084.52 --> 6089.08]  could do a pricing adjustment because the cost difference between the oled panel and the old one
[6089.08 --> 6094.52]  is not 50 so they're basically just jacking up the price of the regular switch and maybe we're
[6094.52 --> 6101.72]  still going to get a switch pro that's that's kind of what i'm wondering i i have obviously it's cool
[6101.72 --> 6108.52]  be great to have one i have been not interested in purchasing one at all at any point because of
[6108.52 --> 6114.44]  essentially that i bought it not only is the i'm sure that's fine yeah not only is the the steam deck
[6114.44 --> 6121.08]  coming and that was kind of my my big purchase as of late yeah um that's a big purchase but
[6122.76 --> 6128.92]  i just i i can't shake the idea that not only is my current one fine but there's probably another one
[6128.92 --> 6134.68]  coming yeah i i i kind of suspect that there's another one coming because if you're nintendo you're
[6134.68 --> 6139.96]  all about charging a lot of money for things and the the oh yeah the switch is like a 300 console
[6139.96 --> 6148.04]  is it is it 300 or 250 in the u.s i can't remember bestbuy.com the united states i typed in dot com didn't
[6148.04 --> 6161.24]  i okay nintendo switch 339 339 that's got to be a canadian price yeah it's 299 299 in the u.s so the
[6161.24 --> 6167.16]  oled model is 349 did i get now if i'm nintendo why don't i want a piece of that 500 console pie
[6167.16 --> 6172.36]  that's where the switch pro would come in and maybe it maybe it doesn't maybe you can't take
[6172.36 --> 6176.12]  it with you i don't know maybe it's dock only i have i have no idea what could be coming but
[6176.12 --> 6183.64]  with 8k tvs out now and 4k tvs basically mainstream for anyone outside of the very very bottom level of
[6183.64 --> 6189.96]  budgets i i think it's they can't ignore it forever i mean nintendo really does try boy do they ever make
[6189.96 --> 6195.56]  a solid effort to ignore technological advancements forever but uh i think i think they i think they're
[6195.56 --> 6199.88]  gonna do something they're gonna do something now i want to talk about my team viewer update
[6200.84 --> 6208.04]  i tweeted yeah i enjoyed this tweet i'm actually excited to see what happened i tweeted out of anger
[6208.04 --> 6214.36]  because something that i was doing related to the linux challenge was i wanted to set up what did i want
[6214.36 --> 6223.96]  to set up i wanted to know if a parsec would be a viable way for me to enjoy games that i absolutely
[6223.96 --> 6229.00]  couldn't play on linux i would understand that that's a total hack because not everyone has two
[6229.00 --> 6236.04]  computers one that they can remote into uh but i wanted to know if if parsec would be a viable way
[6236.04 --> 6243.80]  for me to play a game that is not like uh is completely unplayable and i i didn't even know if
[6243.80 --> 6249.72]  parsec had a client and so what i wanted to do was i wanted to set up my work machine with parsec which i
[6249.72 --> 6254.44]  hadn't before i just have it on my home machine i wanted to install parsec on my work machine so that
[6254.44 --> 6259.24]  i could like try it so that i could install a client on my linux machine at home and i like try to do
[6259.24 --> 6264.20]  that because it's just you want to talk about uh you know streaming game streaming is part of the gaming
[6265.00 --> 6270.76]  experience now it's it's a possibility it's something you can do so i wanted to try it anyway i had to use
[6270.76 --> 6277.48]  team viewer to get into my work machine because that's how i access it and the only reason i had opened it
[6277.48 --> 6285.80]  it all was so that i could install parsec i get this i get this pop-up and you need a little bit
[6285.80 --> 6293.88]  of backstory for why this pop-up is such a big deal tell us what you'll pay oh wow this is tell us what
[6293.88 --> 6304.60]  you'll pay for a subscription and stretch the rest of your 2021 budget contact us okay let's break this
[6304.60 --> 6312.36]  down i have a perpetual license for team viewer 2012 i paid i forget but it was more than five
[6312.36 --> 6318.84]  thousand dollars for the bare minimum number of seats that i needed because at the time we were using
[6318.84 --> 6324.36]  team viewer to remote into an android device that was holding all of our two-factor authentication i'm
[6324.36 --> 6329.40]  comfortable talking about this now because we're actually doing things a different way now and it's
[6329.40 --> 6334.52]  better yeah it's it's it's better it's more secure and uh we're not going to talk about it because
[6334.52 --> 6339.00]  security through obscurity hopefully knock on wood but the point is that's what we were doing then so
[6339.00 --> 6342.52]  we had just had an android phone that was plugged in all the time went through a couple of them before
[6342.52 --> 6347.56]  we uh removed the battery on one before plugging it in all the time that was a good uh it was a good
[6347.56 --> 6351.64]  moment i i just thought they would have better battery management yeah i thought they wouldn't just
[6351.64 --> 6358.28]  blow up in like four months we had two of them do that yeah anyway yeah the point is um we used team viewer
[6358.28 --> 6363.24]  was one of the only solutions in fact i think it might have been the only solution that was truly
[6363.24 --> 6369.72]  cross-platform where you could remote into an android device from a pc or mac and remote into a pc or mac
[6369.72 --> 6378.36]  from an android device and everything worked cross-platform so i was like okay this is a lot of money
[6378.36 --> 6385.56]  but it's a perpetual license no problem now with that i think the next revision of team viewer they
[6385.56 --> 6393.00]  switched to a subscription model and completely discontinued the possibility of buying a perpetual
[6393.00 --> 6399.72]  license of team viewer now funny thing because they didn't want to have to maintain two different
[6399.72 --> 6409.00]  versions of the app on mobile devices a legacy one and a subscription one your old legacy perpetual license
[6409.00 --> 6415.16]  for desktop gets you the latest version of the mobile app okay because and that was just that was
[6415.16 --> 6419.08]  a cost-saving measure that wasn't because they were trying to be good guys but you know what a nightmare
[6419.08 --> 6424.84]  it is maintaining a mobile app it sucks yeah it's it sucks developers are expensive and and so they were
[6424.84 --> 6430.04]  just like okay forget it so on the mobile side you'll just get the latest one so right around that time
[6430.04 --> 6439.00]  team viewer since then has semi-regularly reached out to me over every possible means of communication
[6439.00 --> 6444.76]  they have emailed me they have popped up annoying messages like this in my software that i paid for
[6444.76 --> 6451.56]  they have even called me at unreasonable times in the morning because they don't think maybe i'm on the
[6451.56 --> 6459.64]  west coast and i am not awake yet at 6 a.m my time they have called me completely stupid times of day
[6459.64 --> 6467.16]  to ask me to upgrade to a subscription version of team viewer and my answer every single time every
[6467.16 --> 6474.92]  single time has been no and do not contact me about this again because i have exactly the functionality
[6474.92 --> 6481.00]  i need from team viewer and there's nothing that you can offer me that would make me upgrade from the
[6481.00 --> 6487.48]  version that i'm using yeah all i need it for is we use it for um script remote script review for
[6487.48 --> 6491.80]  example like john's based down in north carolina so team viewer is a nice way for us to both we
[6491.80 --> 6496.68]  actually both remote into the same vm that's running on the server here so that it has access to all the
[6496.68 --> 6501.96]  local resources that he works on and then we can we can both edit and stuff so it does have a purpose
[6501.96 --> 6509.56]  it's a good tool um it's a useful tool it's a useful tool but i can already do that it does absolutely
[6509.56 --> 6516.28]  everything that i need it to do and so i i basically finally got frustrated because i was like i don't
[6516.28 --> 6520.52]  even want to use your software right now i'm just using your software to install some other software
[6520.52 --> 6524.44]  so i send out this this tweet i'm just like i was just kind of irate because i've been troubleshooting
[6524.44 --> 6530.12]  a bunch of stuff i'm working on the linux challenge zero dollars you vampires i paid for an effing
[6530.12 --> 6534.92]  perpetual license of team viewer 12 stop emailing me stop calling me at eastern time o'clock in the
[6534.92 --> 6541.00]  morning and stop popping up this crap when i use the software i paid thousands of dollars for i tagged them
[6541.00 --> 6547.88]  i have never seen a tweet from myself anyway i've never seen a tweet that i've sent out generate
[6547.88 --> 6556.44]  this much animosity toward the subject of the tweet it appears as though absolutely everyone hates team
[6556.44 --> 6562.12]  viewer yeah and the reason for it is pretty apparent because even the users who said hey why don't you
[6562.12 --> 6567.00]  just click oh you guys can't really see this but um oh this is not a touch screen uh whatever there's a
[6567.00 --> 6573.72]  little thing down here that says don't show this message again i was not the only one who noticed
[6573.72 --> 6577.80]  this and so a lot of people were like well why don't you just click that and the answer is because
[6577.80 --> 6583.56]  it doesn't actually work that's why i'm so mad because i tell them don't call me again and they
[6583.56 --> 6588.84]  call me again i tell them don't email me again and they email me again i click don't show this message
[6588.84 --> 6595.80]  again and they show the message again it's extraordinarily frustrating they show like a slightly different
[6595.80 --> 6602.44]  version or something so team viewer team viewer replied to my tweet team viewer support got back
[6602.44 --> 6609.08]  to me look at this look at this at linus g sebastian hi we apologize for the trouble with the pop-up the
[6609.08 --> 6615.64]  self-opt-out is available for licensed customers options advanced show advanced options under team
[6615.64 --> 6621.64]  viewer options untick the box for in-product marketing messages okay i hope this will help you
[6621.64 --> 6629.72]  all right i replied to team viewer and this i didn't i didn't send out a full tweet like i just
[6629.72 --> 6635.40]  replied to them so probably most people haven't seen the best part of the saga it was like five
[6635.40 --> 6639.64]  grand or something can't remember it was a lot oh no this is replying to someone else here that's
[6639.64 --> 6645.88]  right proper tweet how about no pop-up why would i buy a subscription for something i own a perpetual
[6645.88 --> 6651.88]  license for maybe because i hate money let's play a game i'm gonna click don't show this again and go
[6651.88 --> 6660.52]  see if that box is ticked oh wait it's not even there what it is not it is not there in the place
[6660.52 --> 6669.72]  that they told me it is because that button only exists in the subscription versions of team viewer
[6669.72 --> 6683.24]  oh my goodness major major egg on their face big egg did they respond at all big okay so get this
[6683.24 --> 6689.88]  they do not reply to this tweet yeah of course not because brutal they got raced this is like about the
[6689.88 --> 6696.12]  hardest i've seen someone get ratioed in a while they got ratioed super hard here did not reply because
[6696.12 --> 6700.76]  i'm sure i'm sure they had meetings like it's not it wouldn't be the first time that i complained
[6700.76 --> 6705.72]  about something and it generated meetings at a company being like how do we make this go away
[6705.72 --> 6712.84]  as fast as possible so i got a call um it did wake me up this morning i was gonna say was it early in
[6712.84 --> 6717.40]  the morning it wasn't that early i should have been i should have been up already anyway it was at like
[6717.40 --> 6722.68]  nine um and i ended up being late for work today so you know thanks team viewer thank you for the wake up
[6722.68 --> 6732.20]  call the point is i got a call this morning and they said hey sorry about that we have uh we have
[6732.20 --> 6742.12]  marked your account to not get any of these messages anymore here is my response team viewer wrong answer
[6742.12 --> 6749.80]  yeah because the right answer was not to appease the influencer so that they don't complain about you
[6749.80 --> 6758.76]  publicly the right answer is to tell me we have stopped doing this for everyone who has a perpetual
[6758.76 --> 6765.16]  team viewer license we have stopped harassing our customers who already gave us their money because
[6765.16 --> 6773.72]  they didn't give us enough money yet that is the correct answer it shouldn't be me and also i have told
[6773.72 --> 6781.24]  you to put me on that list and until you knew who i was you didn't do it which is the wrong answer so
[6781.24 --> 6787.80]  now i know for a fact the list does exist yeah and that when you tell them not to put you on the list
[6787.80 --> 6794.12]  and you don't happen to be a youtuber they just don't bother can you go after them for can span because of
[6794.12 --> 6801.48]  that probably but it's not worth the effort yeah someone could though so i'm sure you thought that you
[6801.48 --> 6806.60]  were making me happy but what you actually did was demonstrate how terrible your business practices
[6806.60 --> 6812.20]  are for everyone else way to go team viewer treating me special is just another way of saying that you
[6812.20 --> 6817.24]  don't treat your customers like you should yeah because if you know it's the right thing to do and
[6817.24 --> 6825.32]  you'll do it for me then you should automatically do it for everyone that simple yeah so eat a dick team
[6825.32 --> 6830.12]  viewer this segment needs to be clipped and shared all over it probably will be there's a youtube channel
[6830.12 --> 6835.64]  called lmg clips yeah it's actually fantastic we'll email you and tell you about it and i'm
[6835.64 --> 6842.04]  we'll call you in the morning just you know you might already be subscribed to lmg clips but i don't
[6842.04 --> 6848.76]  know if you're a member um so you know yeah uh this is great linus where's the framework uh jake told
[6848.76 --> 6854.28]  me i'm not allowed to use my daily driver lap shop lap shop laptop on when show because i'll leak things
[6854.28 --> 6860.92]  yeah so i agreed with him that was good he made a good call good call jake and so i'm not using my
[6860.92 --> 6864.92]  daily driver laptop honestly though we should just we should just both use frameworks on the lap on the
[6864.92 --> 6869.80]  wanshow that'd be sweet it might not actually be the best because we need to run at standard
[6869.80 --> 6876.44]  resolutions for capture you know for our for our screens here and that display is gonna probably look
[6876.44 --> 6883.00]  a little interpolated because it runs at a weirdo like um two by three resolution or something like that
[6883.00 --> 6887.24]  so it might not be it might not actually be the best for what we're doing but that doesn't mean
[6887.24 --> 6891.56]  that you actually need the the whole desktop usually you're just showing a youtube video right
[6891.56 --> 6897.40]  yeah definitely grab it's more just that i uh like when you're looking at text so that you're you want
[6897.40 --> 6901.32]  to be running at the right native resolution so the capture card can support it properly and so when
[6901.32 --> 6904.36]  you're looking at text it's going to look kind of crappy i guess it doesn't really matter oh the
[6904.36 --> 6908.44]  capture cards have probably got it yeah yeah so i was going to say you can just crop it yeah love you
[6908.44 --> 6915.72]  black magic but also you're not perfect uh okay so i think that's pretty much everything other than
[6915.72 --> 6921.64]  going through some of them super chats super chat i missed the first few because even though i have
[6921.64 --> 6926.84]  submitted a bug report for this youtube has not fixed it so that's pretty cool hey i can share you
[6926.84 --> 6933.64]  guys on my my super chat experience uh you're you're amazing too thanks this is a super weird way for
[6933.64 --> 6945.24]  this to be formatted so that's pretty cool uh hey no problem cadillac bob heck yeah rapid fire um jd says
[6945.24 --> 6950.12]  can you say what happened with the madrinas partnership uh we don't really comment if uh if
[6950.12 --> 6958.28]  a sponsor screws over our viewers then we will comment about it but if it's just you know hey it didn't
[6958.28 --> 6963.56]  work out but let's agree to be friends then we're not really gonna we we're not about public drama
[6963.56 --> 6967.40]  dragging anyone through the mud maybe it was our fault maybe it was their fault i'm just gonna
[6967.40 --> 6973.96]  say that who knows who knows whose fault it was cool uh millich says reminiscing about netlinked i
[6973.96 --> 6978.60]  miss the host having their own spin when introducing the shorter news stories uh said more quickly than
[6978.60 --> 6982.68]  the others please have riley say central park he never says central park anymore that's true
[6984.12 --> 6992.60]  um d temp says the red hat logo has been just a hat not shadow man for two and a half years yeah but
[6992.60 --> 6999.64]  that doesn't change that it was the logo for over 10. uh thracker's odd regarding last man show if
[6999.64 --> 7003.80]  you're worried about running non-steam games i highly recommend lutris yes yes we're uh we're
[7003.80 --> 7009.24]  we're both we're both we're both at that point already i think uh scott says i was looking for
[7010.04 --> 7015.88]  a video about t-lines instead of a reservoir thankful for the old one and cix tech tips number two
[7015.88 --> 7020.68]  are t-lines still viable today yeah they're just a pain in the butt getting all the air bled out of the
[7020.68 --> 7024.76]  system with a t-line sucks if you're looking to save a buck though it is a good way to do it one
[7024.76 --> 7029.56]  of the reasons we use t-lines so often back in the day was that the options for reservoirs were
[7029.56 --> 7037.00]  way more limited than they are now yes someone into the chat called me out for hands under the table
[7037.00 --> 7044.68]  again oh okay andres rivero says framework doesn't have third-party resellers uh shouldn't devices like
[7044.68 --> 7050.28]  their laptop or steam deck be sold through multiple channels uh it helps solve the warehouse issue you
[7050.28 --> 7054.52]  spoke about and let smaller shops grassroots evangelize the product at local level so
[7055.24 --> 7061.48]  what it doesn't help is it doesn't help you be profitable uh by the time you run a product
[7061.48 --> 7065.96]  through distribution and through a retailer you can assume that you're going to be giving up anywhere
[7065.96 --> 7071.80]  from 10 to 20 percent of your margin on the product that that the consumer pays for that directly a lot
[7071.80 --> 7077.16]  of the need to do that these days is also gone like we've looked at we've looked at having third-party
[7077.16 --> 7084.84]  resellers for lttstore.com products but the reality of it is we don't mark we don't mark things up like
[7084.84 --> 7091.00]  we we tend to go for really high quality materials in the stuff that we make and a lot of the time
[7091.00 --> 7095.48]  we'll end up spending an extra you know three dollars which doesn't sound like a lot of money but that's
[7096.20 --> 7101.08]  that's the margin that we could have given a retailer in order to get broader exposure for our
[7101.08 --> 7107.56]  product so for something like an amazon a marketplace i think it ends up costing only marginally more if
[7107.56 --> 7112.76]  we maintain if we own our own inventory and it's just fulfilled by amazon but if you're working
[7112.76 --> 7116.68]  through like a brick and mortar retailer they're going to expect to make considerable margin on the
[7116.68 --> 7121.24]  product that we honestly just don't have and i suspect that is quite similar for the steam deck and
[7121.24 --> 7126.20]  for the framework laptop yeah although neither of those companies have given me any access to their costs
[7126.20 --> 7132.20]  but like like i said already though like it's i don't think it's really needed in the modern world
[7132.20 --> 7139.48]  online shopping is very easy and online shopping on individual stores like framework is also very easy
[7140.36 --> 7145.40]  another thing to consider is that you might think that a store buying your product means that you
[7145.40 --> 7150.28]  improve your cash flow and it can but a lot of times especially brick and mortar is going to expect
[7150.28 --> 7158.36]  anywhere from 30 to 90 days i think costco demands six months uh payment terms so they have the
[7158.36 --> 7163.80]  inventory but you're actually still the one who owns it and the larger the retailer you're working with
[7163.80 --> 7170.28]  the more that they can put the screws to you if for whatever reason the product is not moving very well
[7170.28 --> 7176.36]  and they want you to make it go away so it can actually end up being very expensive to load a bunch of
[7176.36 --> 7181.24]  your inventory into a retailer if they demand and remember they hold all the leverage because they
[7181.24 --> 7186.60]  have both their money and your product yeah and the exposure that you need to reach your customers
[7186.60 --> 7191.48]  they they hold all the cards in that respect right so they could say hey look you need to give us a
[7191.48 --> 7197.96]  hundred dollar rebate for our our spring savings sale event because your competitors are doing that
[7197.96 --> 7202.36]  and they'll work you against your competition like that in a way that you're kind of looking at it
[7202.36 --> 7207.40]  going well hey this like wasn't part of the deal we you know we're trying to make this device that's
[7207.40 --> 7212.20]  really different we're low volume and we can't really play this game i i would i would advise
[7212.20 --> 7217.80]  framework against taking that approach for the time being but not for obvious reasons like to be clear
[7217.80 --> 7222.84]  it's a very good question um just yeah i probably wouldn't do it they also have a tailored shopping
[7222.84 --> 7228.68]  experience um i don't know which one they sell more of but the diy edition you like pick things right
[7228.68 --> 7234.44]  yep it's not usually very easy to do through other types of stores captain pepper have you thought
[7234.44 --> 7239.32]  about looking at new e-bikes or e-scooters it's been five years since your last e-bike video
[7239.32 --> 7243.56]  uh and they've been going through a huge boom you're right the the reason we haven't really jumped
[7243.56 --> 7249.56]  back into it is that i feel like there are creators for the creators who service that niche
[7249.56 --> 7254.60]  really well and our big thing is that we don't want to jump into a conversation unless we have
[7254.60 --> 7259.96]  something to contribute to it and i just i feel like um as someone who daily drives one you know
[7259.96 --> 7267.16]  terren is probably still qualified to talk about it but for my part i haven't really actively used
[7267.16 --> 7273.48]  any e-mobility products in a long time i was super into them and i wanted to try out every kitschy one
[7273.48 --> 7278.44]  that came out like back when i did that unicycle review like the electric unicycle and stuff like that
[7278.44 --> 7282.76]  but the reality of it is in my neighborhood and the places i go and the things i do it's just
[7282.76 --> 7288.44]  not really practical i'm just going to get in the car i'm going to jump on my motorcycle yeah um
[7288.44 --> 7293.48]  tanalu says can you upload the past gaming live streams to float plane like your supreme commander
[7293.48 --> 7298.92]  and don't starve games uh there's only one that i think is missing and i forget why i didn't put it
[7298.92 --> 7306.12]  up i think i didn't end up with the vod for some reason oh um yeah mr wilson i remember my first linux
[7306.12 --> 7311.24]  experience i had experience installing windows and was stunned that on the first boot the desktop was the
[7311.24 --> 7317.00]  correct resolution without drivers it was emulating the gpu as a stop cap awesome idea yeah there's
[7317.00 --> 7320.60]  there are things that linux does really well in fairness windows also boots up the correct
[7320.60 --> 7325.40]  resolution these days now yeah it's been a while was it linux has been doing that better for a
[7325.40 --> 7332.20]  for a lot longer very long time yeah uh aaron says if you're okay we're getting into a pretty heavy
[7332.20 --> 7340.04]  uh heavy part of the super chatness here um if your engineering approach is the users should just
[7340.04 --> 7344.28]  read the manual and learn to use it then you are not a very good engineer you might actually be an
[7344.28 --> 7349.72]  excellent engineer but what you aren't is a good ux designer and it depends on what you're making
[7349.72 --> 7355.48]  right if you're making something that is specifically just for experts in the field yes that's probably
[7355.48 --> 7361.64]  fine yeah um and it might actually be better that way in a in a few different ways uh because you might
[7361.64 --> 7368.76]  have to oversimplify things to in order to accommodate that specifically better for new users user experience
[7368.76 --> 7376.04]  etc but yeah anyways uh rosalind seville has probably the best super chat of the day yeah linux is fine
[7376.04 --> 7383.56]  but it's no temple os that's true linux is almost nothing like temple os what you said was factually
[7383.56 --> 7391.24]  accurate uh this is another great comment under here so i have i've googled this but i haven't looked
[7391.24 --> 7398.92]  at the results yet um this is fantastic imagine someone makes a linux distro that was windows 7 like
[7398.92 --> 7404.60]  okay i've googled this but i haven't looked at the result yet here we go best linux distributions that
[7404.60 --> 7410.04]  look like windows linux lite windows 7 users may not have the latest and greatest hardware so it's
[7410.04 --> 7416.36]  essential to use that is lightweight and easy to use okay can i replace uh okay so hold on that which
[7416.36 --> 7423.08]  look like windows 11 and 10 for windows 7 users looks a bit like windows okay oh you know what i
[7423.08 --> 7430.20]  was expecting one that is oh hold on hold on distros that look like the windows 7 ctrl f 7 here we go
[7430.20 --> 7437.24]  man the number of like linux distro listicles okay mint you can configure it to be the same as windows xp
[7437.24 --> 7441.88]  windows 7 windows 8 or windows 10. all right linux communities got you covered but that's also one of
[7441.88 --> 7446.04]  the biggest problems that makes it extremely overwhelming to figure out which one to use
[7446.36 --> 7458.12]  uh oh man uh oh wow there's a lot i'm sorry guys i'm not reading all the super chat stuff um
[7459.00 --> 7464.68]  especially because some of it is just astonishingly stupid and i'm not out to antagonize our viewers
[7465.64 --> 7471.80]  i just i can't make my i can't make my head hurt enough that the amount that it would hurt just reading out
[7471.80 --> 7488.92]  what some of these things say um yeah okay cool uh okay what is this oh uh oh what's nick calling me for
[7489.72 --> 7492.68]  what's nick calling me for he must know he's gonna be on wanshow
[7492.68 --> 7499.96]  hey nick you're live on wanshow am i antagonizing the users too much they're not buying enough lttstore.com
[7500.68 --> 7505.72]  no no i was just gonna say uh the ufd stream is like one percent away from finishing so it'd be
[7505.72 --> 7509.64]  cool to send a bunch of people over there when you guys are done oh yeah what platform is it on
[7510.52 --> 7514.68]  um i think they're on youtube and twitch but i think they're mainly on twitch all right all right
[7514.68 --> 7521.16]  cool thanks nick yeah you can you can raid them yeah ufd ufd stream sponsored by linus tech tips yeah
[7521.16 --> 7527.48]  yeah i'm not even joking it's sponsored genuinely is yeah it is um hey taylor says my new gpu from
[7527.48 --> 7532.60]  verified actual gamer program shipped thanks so much ltt team my 1070 died last week we're pretty
[7532.60 --> 7538.52]  disappointed with how high the msrps are of cards now and verified actual gamer program is pretty much
[7538.52 --> 7545.64]  uh dead at this point uh because it feels like msrps and scalper prices have just kind of yeah
[7545.64 --> 7550.92]  msrps are rising like crazy equalized we did a really interesting video uh we shot it today
[7550.92 --> 7556.04]  where you know how one of the hacks to get a gpu for a while was to buy a system and then just flip
[7556.04 --> 7562.76]  all the other components so we did a cost analysis we went and bought a system at best buy and looked
[7562.76 --> 7567.96]  at everything that was in it and compared it to building your own and buying a scalped gpu
[7567.96 --> 7573.40]  and it was on par yeah yeah yeah they've they've closed all those holes um
[7575.24 --> 7580.44]  what was i gonna say i don't remember robert mail says first time i've been able to catch a live show
[7580.44 --> 7588.76]  or vaude nice new set hopefully i haven't missed much you are so full of crap first time i've been
[7588.76 --> 7595.56]  able to catch a let robert say i recognize that name yeah you super chat every show let alone watching
[7595.56 --> 7601.80]  them uh sdg games is there an audio equivalent to the srgb color space
[7601.80 --> 7610.28]  what as a creator what matters most to you in headphones or speakers well it's going to be
[7610.28 --> 7615.64]  it's going to be accuracy and then i think what you're kind of asking is like like what like the
[7615.64 --> 7620.52]  range of performance they might have is in that case you're looking at like a frequency response
[7620.52 --> 7625.96]  curve so you want something that is able to reproduce very low and very high frequencies but
[7625.96 --> 7633.08]  it's not like like srgb is kind of like it's the subset of all perceivable colors but in the audio
[7633.08 --> 7638.04]  spectrum we've had devices that have been able to reproduce the entire audible spectrum for many
[7638.04 --> 7644.84]  many years now so it just comes down to how well they can do it david champaign is a 2021 facebook
[7644.84 --> 7649.32]  outage survivor yeah i think i survived all right too i didn't notice to be perfectly the only reason
[7649.32 --> 7653.00]  why i knew was because i went to the washroom which is the only time that i ever used twitter
[7653.00 --> 7657.16]  twitter and i opened up twitter and everyone was talking about it and then i made a like meme about
[7657.16 --> 7662.60]  how flow plane is still up and then i didn't know that facebook was down while it was down i found
[7662.60 --> 7667.40]  out later yeah because i was like working i don't know if i actually found out during or after because
[7667.40 --> 7673.24]  i never checked because i don't care hey thanks rey oh just accepted an offer to join a fang company
[7673.24 --> 7679.40]  and started watching you when i was 13. dang good for you taking that money get the money
[7679.40 --> 7685.24]  uh dusk pierce asks i sent this once but when you get the steam deck can you try it with an m cable
[7685.24 --> 7688.60]  you're gonna have to remind me when it arrives i don't have a i'm not logged into like my accounts
[7688.60 --> 7691.88]  or anything i don't have a convenient way to write this down right now but um yes
[7692.84 --> 7702.36]  um i'm very interested to see that as well oh nice fan24 drr says i got two ltd store water bottles
[7702.36 --> 7710.60]  from ufd tech as he passed through columbus on his cannonball run very nice sweet very nice uh nokie
[7710.60 --> 7716.92]  1119 says hey timestamp guy here the last on-site wan show was on the 14th of december 2019
[7716.92 --> 7724.36]  664 days ago do you miss the old set i'll miss luke's birds so that computer that we're running off
[7724.36 --> 7732.04]  of right now hadn't been turned on since january of 2020 so when jake turned it on there was like
[7732.04 --> 7742.76]  three hours of updates we know how long it's been uh uh conrad in float plane chat said i work for fang
[7742.76 --> 7749.56]  as well float plane amazon apple netflix google lol that's a good one i mean with how much downtime
[7749.56 --> 7754.20]  facebook has had i don't think they deserve to be a fang anymore oh get wrecked i think it's more based
[7754.20 --> 7759.32]  around the money but blackjack 410 says i just subscribed to float plane i don't see this stream
[7759.32 --> 7763.48]  uh it's on there it's in the live tab um and i wanted to yell at y'all and ask how long i have
[7763.48 --> 7764.92]  to wait to buy a freaking screwdriver
[7771.56 --> 7779.48]  wounds a little fresh um a little fresh i got a call from nick before the show the screwdriver is very
[7779.48 --> 7790.36]  delayed it's like it's it's delayed it's like new year delayed at this point um has to do with the
[7790.36 --> 7795.80]  power outages in china pushing work back to taiwan where we're manufacturing a number of the parts um
[7795.80 --> 7799.56]  and other places being pushed back to other places being pushed back to taiwan as well
[7799.56 --> 7807.80]  um we explored the option of having some of it done in canada but um while the steel stuff could be done
[7807.80 --> 7814.76]  here the manufacturer we're working with uh for the zinc housings is not confident that the zinc work
[7814.76 --> 7822.28]  could be done here um and it was so it would add i think about 10 11 of cost we would have to
[7823.56 --> 7828.12]  produce the things in taiwan then we'd have to send all the materials so we'd have to send all the materials
[7828.12 --> 7832.12]  to canada then send them back to taiwan to be assembled then send them back here so it was
[7832.12 --> 7838.36]  going to add other delays like like logistical delays even if they could work on it which is a
[7838.36 --> 7842.84]  big issue right now just throwing that and i think it was going to add a cost of about 11 a unit we're
[7842.84 --> 7846.84]  already doing some of the production in canada we're doing final assembly we're doing all the injection
[7846.84 --> 7852.52]  molding uh here like it's not like this is just over cheaping out and we're just trying to do everything
[7852.52 --> 7857.80]  at the lowest possible cost it's just the the the taiwanese manufacturer that we're working with
[7857.80 --> 7864.20]  is not um is not able to get a lot of the materials that they need to produce it and that has to do with
[7864.20 --> 7873.64]  shortages and challenges going on really across well across the world really oh boy yeah so it's going to
[7873.64 --> 7885.00]  be it's going to be a minute yeah that one was a little fresh uh xp bill says linus why is your name
[7885.00 --> 7889.24]  pronounced a little differently than linux even though it is only one letter different please very
[7889.24 --> 7896.60]  important question uh because linus torvalds is finnish i think yeah finish i think so and so his name
[7896.60 --> 7903.00]  even though it's spelled exactly the same as mine is i think usually pronounced linus so linus linux
[7903.64 --> 7909.16]  linus because i'm not finnish and i don't speak anything other than time to make a new distro
[7909.72 --> 7912.28]  uh like if i was lynx that's not gonna get confused
[7915.00 --> 7921.48]  yeah i'll do uh i'll like fork arch or something linux arch arch linux linux
[7921.48 --> 7929.64]  yes that's very helpful thank you luke all right i think that is pretty much it there's
[7929.64 --> 7935.08]  there's hannah montana linux yeah thank you for that i think that's pretty much it for the uh the
[7935.08 --> 7940.36]  wan show today we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel we may be in person next
[7940.36 --> 7946.12]  week depending on how much progress luke and i have made on our our streaming aspect of the linux challenge
[7946.12 --> 7953.40]  uh we'll probably be back to in person after that but i think a wan show is a good acid test for just
[7953.40 --> 7958.68]  how well we have each managed to get our streaming setups working we might do we might do it a different
[7958.68 --> 7964.04]  way maybe we both do like a simultaneous stream on twitch one night or something like that and maybe we
[7964.04 --> 7967.48]  just do a wan show here i don't know we'll figure it out thanks for tuning in we'll see you guys again
[7968.68 --> 7969.00]  bye
[7969.00 --> 7982.04]  oh oh oh we got a raid ufd hey how do you how does one rate you slash raid space and then their channel
[7982.04 --> 7988.84]  name so slash raid space uh uf d but it's disciple so uf disciple
[7988.84 --> 7999.80]  okay so did i did i do that i think okay there it goes all right all right all right see you later guys
[7999.80 --> 8009.80]  yeah you're doing it yeah
[8018.84 --> 8028.20]  okay we are still live on fish and float plane but i have cut the youtube
