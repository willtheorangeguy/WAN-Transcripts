[0.00 --> 12.96]  welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you all today
[12.96 --> 20.52]  lots of good topics to talk about this week Dell has built upon frameworks framework and is showing
[20.52 --> 28.98]  off their project Luna concept laptop supposed to be more reusable repairable rebe sustainable
[28.98 --> 34.26]  re-sustainable yes recyclable that's the one so we're gonna be talking about that what else we
[34.26 --> 44.16]  got Intel is working on that's boring HDMI 2.0 has been HDMI 2.1 this whole time it was all like boom
[44.16 --> 51.96]  mask reveal if it wasn't for these darn kids we would have known it's not a ghost it's HDMI 2.1
[51.96 --> 59.64]  all right speaking of I don't know TikTok is opening 300 virtual restaurants is this a
[59.64 --> 68.10]  metaverse thing is this a Mr. Beast thing only time will tell okay also Microsoft along with uh was it
[68.10 --> 73.42]  Dell yeah Microsoft leans further into right to repair as well we talked about this sort of we
[73.42 --> 78.26]  talked about how they were thinking about it in the past now there's more action that would be good
[78.26 --> 79.40]  very cool
[79.40 --> 106.90]  and the show is brought to you by secret lab ridge wallet and ek water blocks is sponsoring the show
[106.90 --> 114.42]  today how fun is that why don't we jump right into our headline topic of the day tick tock is
[114.42 --> 123.10]  apparently opening up 300 virtual restaurants so if you're not familiar with the concept of a ghost
[123.10 --> 132.02]  restaurant basically it's a network of oftentimes completely unrelated kitchens and sometimes they're
[132.02 --> 140.66]  commercial kitchens sometimes they're operating commercially as kitchens um with recipes that
[140.66 --> 147.38]  are standardized across the the menu of whatever the the sort of the virtual brand of restaurant is
[147.38 --> 154.90]  and that unlock the ability for these for these sort of virtual uh food brands to deliver their food
[154.90 --> 162.98]  sort of overnight across uh a very very large area say for example you know the entire continental u.s
[162.98 --> 170.10]  so what you do is you come up with the restaurants that you want to serve you presumably create some you've
[170.10 --> 176.42]  signed some kind of deal partnering with a network of of ghost kitchens and you you launch your restaurant
[176.42 --> 184.66]  obviously nobody would be able to come in and eat at a mr beast diner uh as it stands right now but
[184.66 --> 192.26]  linus tech treats but yeah linus tech treats dog treats or something that treats i kind of like it um
[192.26 --> 198.66]  um you obviously you wouldn't be able to eat at you know an actual mr beast restaurant for example but
[198.66 --> 204.74]  you could invest in branding for delivery vehicles uh in order to make it you know feel more like a
[204.74 --> 211.38]  like a restaurant order experience uh you could just you know use regular skip the dishes or uber eats
[211.38 --> 219.62]  and and make it all just completely all take out you know all um oh man i'm i'm missing the whatever
[219.62 --> 226.74]  all app-based delivery services um and as long as you figure out a way to control the quality of the food
[226.74 --> 234.50]  then it's a pretty cool way to a build a build a brand you know build a food brand build a loyal
[234.50 --> 242.18]  audience but b also provide some support for an industry that has actually been suffering uh the
[242.18 --> 247.30]  the food industry has been suffering although i would make the argument that a big part of why the food
[247.30 --> 254.82]  service industry is suffering is because of app-based yep app-based delivery people who take out via app do
[254.82 --> 262.42]  not buy things like alcohol especially because in a lot of areas that's not actually allowed so a lot
[262.42 --> 269.14]  of what they make margin on is not happening and the apps take monster cuts a lot of what they lose
[269.14 --> 276.18]  money on like packing materials is um amplified they're not obviously going to get tipped in the
[276.18 --> 280.98]  same way because the tips when you order through an app are going to go to typically the driver is my
[280.98 --> 286.42]  understanding not the actual people who work at the restaurant so there's there's a lot of there's a
[286.42 --> 294.98]  lot of challenges with all this but it is apparently happening and the newest virtual restaurant tour is
[294.98 --> 302.50]  apparently tick tock um they teamed up with virtual dining concepts to create these ghost restaurants
[302.50 --> 307.94]  these are the same company that worked on the mr beast restaurants one of which is actually becoming a
[307.94 --> 313.86]  brick and mortar location what a wild mr beast one yeah what a wild time to be alive yeah amazing yeah
[313.86 --> 318.82]  you could go to an actual like youtuber restaurant but think about it's just more content there's no
[318.82 --> 322.10]  way he's not going to film the launch you're not wrong i mean you know what it's a matter of time
[322.10 --> 327.70]  before we do a land center yeah like 100 yeah how could we possibly fail at that business
[329.14 --> 335.54]  how how badly could i possibly up that's how to not manage to run a successful land that's where you
[335.54 --> 341.78]  sell the in-person merch and how much content would we get out of like creating a land center yeah
[341.78 --> 348.18]  like it's it's one of those things that's been on my list for ages just like honestly i could i
[348.18 --> 357.22]  could go i could go rent some like commercial property tomorrow be like okay we're creating linus land tips
[357.78 --> 366.98]  llc llt llc it's got it's got a it rolls off the tongue you know you you serve even if you can't
[366.98 --> 372.02]  get an alcohol license which is notoriously difficult here in the greater vancouver area even if you can't
[372.02 --> 377.30]  get an alcohol license you just do you do energy drinks you do snacks you do all that kind of stuff
[377.30 --> 384.34]  you charge people by the hour you just you create a premium experience because honestly treats land every
[384.34 --> 389.54]  land center i've ever been to other than maybe that cool gaming hotel has just been kind of crap
[390.10 --> 396.50]  and i think there's room to do so much better like just don't cheap out make sure that every machine in
[396.50 --> 401.62]  the building has whatever the latest hot game is have it on there have it licensed if people have their
[401.62 --> 406.50]  own account by all means sign into it but these are these are problems that can absolutely be overcome
[406.50 --> 410.34]  and i think that people will pay extra for a premium experience i think that that's something we could
[410.34 --> 417.70]  absolutely do um land center with vr stations yeah absolutely fleona something that i i would
[417.70 --> 422.82]  love to to have going is something you and i have always talked about is like lands have gotten kind
[422.82 --> 431.22]  of lame since i guess uh internet and social services and whatnot have all become more common because like
[431.22 --> 436.58]  now you go to a land and everyone's just like sitting on some mmo or facebook or i mean that happened a
[436.58 --> 442.82]  long time ago oh yeah for sure okay but before then it was way cooler just saying because everyone
[442.82 --> 448.26]  would play the same game because what are you gonna do how do i say this without offending our entire audience
[449.78 --> 460.02]  the problem with lan gaming is gamers yeah yeah there's nothing about old school gaming or modern gaming
[460.02 --> 467.62]  that couldn't equally be adapted to the land party environment the problem is that in order for a party
[467.62 --> 476.42]  to be fun people have to participate and gamers have and i feel like this is something that has been
[476.42 --> 483.94]  exacerbated by modern gaming but gamers tend to enjoy things that are within their comfort zone i think that
[483.94 --> 489.94]  is a fair generalization it's obviously not true about everyone but it's definitely a tendency within
[489.94 --> 494.90]  the gaming community for a land to work better you kind of need something that almost no one has played
[494.90 --> 499.30]  or they haven't played since the last time you guys land together so another thing that gamers do
[499.30 --> 506.10]  is they tend to have like like a main game or a handful of main games yeah for sure so you've got
[506.10 --> 512.10]  two problems here you've got people that like their main game and you've got this hesitancy
[512.10 --> 517.78]  to try something new in a lot of cases especially if it's something where you're not going
[517.78 --> 524.02]  to have fun because you're not going to be able to perform up to the level that other people at
[524.02 --> 530.50]  the lan are are going to be able to because that's their main game so what you need in order to have
[530.50 --> 537.22]  a like the best land gaming experiences i ever had were the ones where there were like clear
[537.22 --> 543.62]  games masters yes in charge yeah that would basically say okay we're doing a free-for-all
[543.62 --> 550.98]  scrimmage match everybody go okay i'm making teams yeah i'm rebalancing the teams i'm i'm doing this
[550.98 --> 558.10]  i'm doing that i'm creating a structure to this i'm sorry is that world of warcraft on your computer
[559.54 --> 566.90]  turn it off or leave because there are 16 of us which means that it's eight versus eight
[566.90 --> 571.78]  not eight versus seven and we're playing this game right now that'd be sweet and that's actually
[571.78 --> 576.50]  exactly what i was getting into is like the the disjointed nature of like three people actually
[576.50 --> 581.54]  playing a game together while 16 people sit there sucks and if everyone actually just plays together
[581.54 --> 586.42]  it's basically always fun all my favorite memories are very similar we used to have like a whiteboard
[586.42 --> 590.58]  and we'd make like the old school version of a challenge thing where you build your own ladder
[590.58 --> 595.06]  and you make little teams and you you play halo where you have like one team is in the garage
[595.06 --> 598.98]  playing on a couch out there and one team's inside and you're yelling at each other the whole time and
[598.98 --> 604.66]  stuff and it's awesome but everyone has to be involved for it to be awesome absolutely and it's
[604.66 --> 613.62]  like okay okay you're like that's not your favorite game fine suck it up because then i will play not my
[613.62 --> 620.66]  favorite game but that is your favorite game and we can both get to have a fun experience instead of
[620.66 --> 624.26]  both of us just sitting here something doing something we could have done in our basements at home
[624.26 --> 629.06]  yes i would personally i am not motivated to go to a land center if there's a land center
[629.70 --> 638.26]  locally i would not go but if they had events yes it's yes it's so good it's halo one night
[638.26 --> 644.10]  i'm in it's quake three night i'm in it's midtown madness to cops and robbers night i've never even
[644.10 --> 649.62]  really heard of that but i'm in yeah it's worms night sweet whatever yeah right like it all sounds
[649.62 --> 654.58]  great we're having a six hour worms armageddon tournament if i know people are gonna be like
[654.58 --> 658.74]  hyped up and we're gonna have some fun i don't care if i've ever played it before or heard of it
[658.74 --> 665.38]  i'm in let's go you know what didn't mean to press that you're also sort of um how do i put this
[665.38 --> 671.54]  you're you're also sort of i think taking for granted that you're really good at games like you
[671.54 --> 678.18]  will pick up a game that you've never played and we have kind of luke and i have kind of this uh this
[678.18 --> 684.26]  skill curve where i tend to be better at it immediately like for the first maybe 20 minutes
[685.06 --> 692.10]  and then past about that point luke is almost immediately way better at it than me forever
[692.10 --> 698.98]  we're like that's just how it is i feel like we're decently even in towerfall uh yeah but i've played it
[698.98 --> 709.46]  a lot more than you oh this is what i'm talking about i mean i've played it with my kids but like
[709.46 --> 714.02]  so i haven't i haven't like played against someone who could really challenge me this is before my son
[714.02 --> 720.42]  got good enough to actually dude he won like a few times last time we played in fairness i was
[721.14 --> 727.86]  really not at my best not on it either so you know what but but still is a w a w or is it something
[727.86 --> 733.46]  other than a w it's still a w a w is a w he he fought for it and he earned it 100 he did he did
[733.46 --> 741.22]  he he played to win that kid plays to win yeah i i worry sometimes that like the hyper competitive
[741.22 --> 747.86]  nature of that particular child of mine is gonna something it'll something will happen uh jhor said
[747.86 --> 752.18]  not an entire center dedicated to this but definitely a dedicated game night section of the land center
[752.18 --> 759.14]  would be cool uh it's like yeah screw it no yeah that's the whole point yeah that's the entire point
[759.14 --> 764.98]  it literally seeing one person just seated i'm gonna go away from the mic i'm sorry seeing one
[764.98 --> 772.42]  person seated like this on facebook just kills the whole thing kills the vibe you gotta have
[772.42 --> 777.30]  everyone engaged like it actually matters to have everyone that's there yeah truce gods like
[777.30 --> 781.14]  carmageddon was great especially when you messed around with the config on the server made people's
[781.14 --> 787.54]  cars bounce off the sky or like exactly that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about
[787.54 --> 794.82]  i love it so that's my big problem with land parties and i don't remember how i got on this subject ah yes
[794.82 --> 802.18]  right i i would love to open up a land center but it would only be fun if i could do it my way where
[802.90 --> 809.70]  it's you you do it my way or honestly i think if you didn't do it your way i well it might do okay
[809.70 --> 814.74]  because it's a tide tied to yeah this but like if it wasn't tied to this i think it would just die
[815.30 --> 826.18]  okay hold on a second man it would be like the sweaty nerd equivalent of like an exclusive nightclub
[826.82 --> 833.38]  yeah that would be so cool yeah because i because whether people know it or not they would show up
[833.38 --> 839.70]  having you know especially like younger younger kids okay like you're 15 you're 18 or whatever
[839.70 --> 846.10]  right you have never experienced what land gaming was like in the early 2000s you were literally not
[846.10 --> 851.54]  born yet totally different it's totally different you come in thinking oh i just want to go like
[851.54 --> 856.34]  somewhere where they have a high-end computer and i can play my game at like high fps you end up getting
[856.34 --> 862.02]  drawn into like whatever this weird tournament we're doing is or whatever you're gonna want to
[862.02 --> 867.70]  come back because it's not like anything else we used to play like at lands at outhouse we used to
[867.70 --> 874.50]  play weird games too because a huge goal was making sure no one had really played it so like robot unicorn
[874.50 --> 880.50]  attack was like some weird flash game that we played that ended up like being a total hit because it was
[880.50 --> 886.26]  really like kind of twitchy and reaction time fun yeah and we'd like put it up on a projector and
[886.26 --> 889.86]  everyone would like there was this weird song that played in the background so people would start like
[889.86 --> 894.50]  singing it and get really hyped up like it's oh man here's one that i would bring in uh
[894.50 --> 899.54]  unfortunately i've probably played it too much to actually participate but it's called liero
[900.42 --> 909.70]  liero liero it's worms but real time uh and you can play multiplayer split screen awesome um
[910.74 --> 917.22]  and basically you just you have all these different weapons it is extremely easy to
[917.22 --> 924.10]  accidentally suicide the f out of yourself uh you've got a hook shot so you can kind of get around that
[924.10 --> 930.50]  way oh nice so you can see uh he just set a bomb that just created some space uh you got a tunnel around
[930.50 --> 936.74]  so you tunnel by going back and forth really quickly on the left and right button it is so much fun but
[936.74 --> 941.30]  there's there's always a solution too so like when you're saying oh i played this too much you can just
[941.30 --> 945.54]  position yourself as like the final boss and that's true you can actually you can handicap in this game
[946.26 --> 950.10]  so you can just set yourself to have like almost no health so you have to like get right in and
[950.10 --> 954.74]  assassinate whoever's playing right now is absolutely terrible and i would play with my friends
[955.46 --> 961.86]  in mr mccloskey's portable during lunch uh we were we got to the point where it was like kind of kind of
[961.86 --> 968.34]  ridiculous actually it's so good my understanding is that it was actually re because the source code
[968.34 --> 974.58]  was lost for this game at some point or another and then somebody went back and tried to remake it
[974.58 --> 982.50]  um i i i don't guys i'm real rusty i'm real rusty on all the details but man having a liaro night
[982.50 --> 986.74]  would be freaking amazing you'd have all these people that have like no idea what they're doing going
[986.74 --> 993.22]  and just absolutely exploding themselves with chiquita bombs so good you can also like so good
[993.22 --> 996.74]  if you want to you could make prizes but you can make them like really weird i don't know if i've
[996.74 --> 1002.42]  ever told you about it but when i used to host lands back at uvic yeah we gave out bananas oh that's fun
[1003.06 --> 1008.34]  if you won you won a banana so i'd like go buy a bushel of bananas before land night and then just like
[1008.34 --> 1011.70]  enjoy your snack gamer yeah victory snack yeah
[1011.70 --> 1019.62]  all right so back to tick tock's thing which is actually sort of boring news um they're gonna make
[1019.62 --> 1022.98]  a restaurant i mean that really was that really was the whole thing i just wanted to talk about
[1022.98 --> 1029.62]  how cool it would be to run a land center uh also uh there is other tick tock news um the what's the
[1029.62 --> 1033.62]  whole what's the whole thing oh never mind apparently there's more crap about this so you'll be able to
[1033.62 --> 1041.14]  order tasty trending tick tock dishes like tomato feta pasta and other assorted viral dishes directly to your
[1041.14 --> 1046.66]  door that is actually a really cool concept the menu will change on a quarterly basis and it will
[1046.66 --> 1051.38]  include some of the platform's biggest food trends so the original the initial batch will feature the
[1051.38 --> 1056.90]  aforementioned baked feta pasta which google says was the most searched dish of 2021 as well as a smash
[1056.90 --> 1061.46]  burger and pasta chips and they're going to start with 300 locations with the plan to expand to more
[1061.46 --> 1068.18]  than a thousand by the end of 2022. they say they'll give a cut of the profits from the venture to the
[1068.18 --> 1072.74]  creators of the recipes that is going to be difficult to validate who created the recipe the
[1072.74 --> 1078.66]  one who comes up with like mostly the recipe or the one who adds like a bit of cilantro to it um that
[1079.22 --> 1086.34]  my yeah get derivatives real um as well as burgeoning food creators on the platform however they did yeah
[1086.34 --> 1092.26]  they didn't clarify how they're going to determine the true creator of the dish so uh good luck with that
[1092.26 --> 1099.46]  now we have a discussion topic from colin if you were to start a tick tock food trend what would your
[1099.46 --> 1105.78]  dish be you can't say cereal he knew i was going to say cereal i would love to have my own cereal they'd
[1105.78 --> 1111.78]  be linus tech bits or something like that oh man quick bits would be such a fun quick bit cereal i feel
[1111.78 --> 1119.14]  like quick bits would almost be like like microwave porridge or something microwave porridge okay i can't
[1119.14 --> 1124.66]  say microwave porridge i don't i don't think you can describe cereal as as quick uh i mean it's pretty
[1124.66 --> 1131.22]  quick but it's all the same speed it um do you know what i mean like cereal as the concept is quick
[1131.22 --> 1136.10]  you're dodging the question what's the question the question is what would be your tick tock oh sorry
[1136.10 --> 1142.34]  i've been focused on on merch messages people are going ham okay well i can go first yeah okay well this
[1142.34 --> 1146.58]  and this i i don't think this would ever be trendy so i'm going to pivot and i'm going to talk about one
[1146.58 --> 1151.38]  of the weirdest snacks that i ever ate regularly oh nice i got a few of those so one of my thing
[1151.38 --> 1155.94]  one of the things that my mom would do when i was growing up is she would sit at the dining room table
[1155.94 --> 1160.90]  with her newspaper because that's the era that i grew up in uh she would sit at the dining room table
[1160.90 --> 1166.10]  with her newspaper in her house coat and she would sit and consume an entire head of iceberg lettuce
[1166.82 --> 1173.14]  it's just crunchy it's satisfying um okay so i i would you know i was a i was a young boy and i was
[1173.14 --> 1177.94]  like oh mom's eating lettuce okay i'm gonna go pick at some of her lettuce and then she got like
[1177.94 --> 1181.46]  defensive about it because like it's her lettuce and she's like actually this is my lettuce so
[1181.46 --> 1186.90]  obviously that made me want it so much more because if i could have a tasty snack while also bothering
[1186.90 --> 1194.34]  my mother then that's like a plus primo yeah um gamer moves and what one day i was like ah you know what
[1194.34 --> 1199.06]  like it just doesn't really you know it doesn't it doesn't taste like anything it's got a great texture
[1199.06 --> 1205.78]  i love love the texture of iceberg lettuce i don't know why i did it but i like dipped it in soy sauce
[1207.78 --> 1214.74]  and for like probably a year after that that was my snack i would sit and i would consume like i would
[1214.74 --> 1219.86]  sit and consume like half of a head of iceberg lettuce just like a little bit just like dipped
[1219.86 --> 1225.38]  in a little bit of soy sauce so you got like this crunchy salty snack and as far as as far as health
[1225.38 --> 1232.58]  goes i mean it's a heck of a lot better than sitting and eating potato chips sure you're certainly
[1232.58 --> 1240.58]  consuming probably more sodium than is optimal yeah but on lettuce instead of on you know a fried potato
[1240.58 --> 1247.14]  yeah so yeah she never no one ever really stopped me like it didn't bother anyone so i would just yeah
[1247.14 --> 1253.70]  i would just consume these copious amounts of lettuce uh with soy sauce and that was um that was that
[1253.70 --> 1260.34]  was that was my snack my weirdest one yeah i used to just eat uh black olives out of the can straight
[1260.34 --> 1265.30]  out of the can oh that's not even weird to me no that's like the other man that don't impress me much
[1265.30 --> 1271.46]  my favorite thing to make like if it's like a saturday and i'm hungry even now and i've been doing it
[1271.46 --> 1276.74]  since i was very young is i get a i don't know why it's a blueberry bagel i'm fairly certain that's
[1276.74 --> 1280.58]  just all we had in the house at the time yeah and i've just never changed it because i like it and i
[1280.58 --> 1286.02]  see no reason to change it sure but blueberry bagel with a not too much i find a lot of people
[1286.02 --> 1293.30]  way too much but just a little bit of mayonnaise mayonnaise on a bagel some bacon a lot of lettuce
[1294.34 --> 1300.98]  and that's it with peach juice it's really good huh i don't think either of these is going to be a
[1300.98 --> 1311.94]  viral sensation no no no one else has ever been interested in that but i love it huh okay what i
[1311.94 --> 1319.22]  do like making that could be uh more interesting to people is inverted chicken cordon bleu i've
[1319.22 --> 1326.74]  probably told you about so cheese on the outside cheese and uh prosciutto and basil interesting so you
[1326.74 --> 1334.50]  do how do you prosciutto yeah it's it the cooking pro i used to do it um on early date nights when
[1334.50 --> 1340.02]  i'd have a girl over and then i would cook it in person because it was really impressive because the
[1340.02 --> 1348.18]  process of cooking it okay that's was like it worked really well you can say it's as cringy as you want
[1348.18 --> 1351.46]  but that that was highly successful
[1354.18 --> 1356.90]  let me confess something that you might not realize
[1358.34 --> 1364.42]  i don't have a lot of moves with the ladies well there's a move dude not that i'm gonna need it
[1364.42 --> 1370.58]  that's fair that's fair i don't have a lot of moves with the ladies so i have no context whatsoever
[1370.58 --> 1379.70]  for what's a good move and what's a bad move but if you say wrapping a hunk of chicken in ham and cheese
[1379.70 --> 1388.58]  and frying it is a move then i think i can say with complete confidence i will never understand women
[1388.58 --> 1394.10]  and i usually like roast some cashews with it and make some asparagus and like do other stuff as well
[1394.10 --> 1399.46]  like it was like a full it wasn't just like one piece of chicken on a plate it was a full meal but
[1400.58 --> 1407.22]  it was good are their standards really that low do guys suck that much i think that's that impressive
[1407.22 --> 1413.86]  i think no one i think very few not no one very few guys cook so you show like yeah i can cook i can
[1413.86 --> 1418.02]  you can cook like two things yeah and they're really good and i guess that's all you really need
[1418.90 --> 1426.74]  on a first date i think it's three so take that back are two of the three things some form of chicken
[1426.74 --> 1434.34]  no are all three of the things some form of chicken nope nope i'm going purely unique okay yeah
[1434.34 --> 1435.30]  all right yeah
[1438.50 --> 1445.78]  ken k says guys suck that much yes yeah we just it makes it really easy to show off so you might as
[1445.78 --> 1449.54]  well actually do it that's i think part of the problem is that guys will be like oh that's low brow
[1449.54 --> 1463.14]  i'm just gonna do nothing which is not better okay oh man all right what is our next topic here oh
[1463.14 --> 1475.14]  speaking of cringe hdmi 2.0 has been hdmi 2.1 this whole time surprise this was posted by sounds on the
[1475.14 --> 1486.98]  forum and basically we are no longer going to use the term hdmi 2.0 uh i love this summary from sounds
[1486.98 --> 1492.82]  is this is this the headline oh no this is just actually from sounds a new display from xiaomi
[1492.82 --> 1500.74]  the xiaomi fast lcd monitor 24.5 inch 240 hertz version sets a new low for the industry
[1500.74 --> 1513.94]  oh man this is amazing so first there was usb3 okay do you guys remember this then there was usb 3.1
[1514.74 --> 1526.74]  gen 1 where usb 3.0 was just renamed okay so the five gigabit usb went from usb3 to usb 3.1 gen 1
[1526.74 --> 1539.86]  and then the 10 gigabit one became usb 3.1 gen 2. okay then this is great usb 3.0 became usb 3.2 gen 1.
[1540.82 --> 1551.94]  um these are like huge like revisions these are huge naming revisions that are hugely confusing uh
[1551.94 --> 1559.06]  because functionally in terms of performance for the end user they have not changed but we are
[1559.06 --> 1568.58]  retroactively renaming these old things like years years down the line in a way that makes it really
[1568.58 --> 1576.26]  difficult to compare newer products against older ones and let's say for example that you know usb 3.2
[1576.26 --> 1583.94]  includes new new aspects of the standard right let's say it has new functionality or new protections
[1583.94 --> 1590.50]  or whatever else if you go and you rename it so that all the all the newer products coming out now
[1590.50 --> 1595.54]  that are branded with this name are not quite the same as the old ones or you make certain parts of
[1595.54 --> 1603.06]  the spec optional right and then you just retroactively say oh well those older ones they were just produced
[1603.06 --> 1612.58]  without optional elements of the spec you are doing nothing but confusing consumers so pretty much
[1612.58 --> 1620.90]  everyone with a brain between their ears looked at what usb was doing and went wow that's really stupid
[1620.90 --> 1626.34]  yeah because it's really hard to understand what anybody is talking about that's one of the reasons
[1626.34 --> 1632.90]  that i typically will just say usb 3 5 gigabit because i don't think i don't think most people
[1632.90 --> 1639.30]  even tech enthusiasts can keep track of all the different nomenclatures that have been used for usb
[1639.30 --> 1648.34]  3 5 gigabit over the years yeah like even okay don't look down name them all three 3.1 gen 1 3.2 gen 1
[1649.14 --> 1653.46]  okay but you looked at it i did okay fine unprompted with that i think i would have
[1653.46 --> 1661.94]  forgot 3.1 gen 1 yeah fair enough so i don't know so it's super confusing whereas if i just said usb 3
[1661.94 --> 1666.02]  5 gigabit would you know what i'm talking about easy yeah okay all right that thing way better yeah and
[1666.02 --> 1673.14]  if i said usb 3 10 gigabit easy you know what i'm talking about yeah um so everyone with a brain said hey
[1673.14 --> 1680.26]  uh that's really stupid you need to stop doing that and everyone without a brain so hdmi um basically said
[1680.26 --> 1687.06]  hey that's that's awesome and uh this came to light after tft central noticed the specs of a
[1687.06 --> 1695.86]  xiaomi fast lcd monitor 240 hertz that said that the hdmi 2.1 ports okay had this asterisk on them
[1695.86 --> 1706.98]  that says due to the subdivision of hdmi certification standards hdmi 2.1 is divided into tmds the bandwidth
[1706.98 --> 1714.58]  is equivalent to the original hdmi 2.0 and frl protocols the hdmi 2.1 interface of this product
[1714.58 --> 1721.46]  supports the tmds protocol so the maximum supported resolution is 1920 by 1080 and the maximum refresh rate
[1721.46 --> 1734.02]  is 240 hertz now hdmi 2.1 has a lot of features many of which are optional that are not just more
[1734.02 --> 1742.42]  bandwidth right like hdmi 2.1 is a more more complicated a more complicated lady okay than just
[1743.14 --> 1750.66]  going way faster so you've also got um e-arc okay so you've got enhanced audio return channel you've got
[1750.66 --> 1755.22]  support for auto low latency mode okay you've got support for variable refresh rate this is actually
[1755.22 --> 1761.54]  baked into the spec now and these are things that were available on hdmi 2.0 products in the past
[1762.34 --> 1770.58]  but the way that we thought of it was that that was an hdmi 2.0 port that implements features that are
[1770.58 --> 1778.90]  optional on 2.0 but that would be included on hdmi 2.1 and that's fine having something that exists at a
[1778.90 --> 1786.02]  lower tier of the standard but that implements optional features of a higher tier or a future tier
[1786.02 --> 1792.74]  that's cool because that means that if you buy it you are at worst getting more than what you bargained
[1792.74 --> 1800.66]  for more than what you anticipated but i think that because we have generally thought of hdmi as
[1801.38 --> 1808.18]  going up a generation or or up a number when the overall bandwidth increases and we can run at a higher
[1808.18 --> 1815.70]  resolution or higher refresh rate to change those rules now is extremely misleading
[1818.18 --> 1824.42]  in response to both tft central and the verge hdmi.org confirmed that devices can no longer be
[1824.42 --> 1833.06]  certified as 2.0 and features of hdmi 2.0 are now a subset of 2.1 and all the new fancy features and
[1833.06 --> 1840.66]  capabilities of 2.1 apparently including running at higher bandwidth are now in fact optional
[1842.10 --> 1847.78]  this puts the onus on manufacturers to somehow outline what their hdmi 2.1 ports are capable of in
[1847.78 --> 1854.74]  a way that is glanceable which is basically not going to happen not not a thing not going to happen
[1854.74 --> 1860.90]  if i'm if i'm an hp or a lenovo or apple or dell or whatever because laptops are where you are really
[1860.90 --> 1867.78]  going to get screwed over right now if i'm one of those guys am i going to be like yeah okay okay
[1867.78 --> 1873.46]  someone all the limitations apple apple was under fire for this recently right with their with their m1 uh
[1873.46 --> 1880.58]  uh m1 macbooks right where they've got it's like oh man i really wish it wasn't hdmi 2.0 because hdmi
[1880.58 --> 1888.58]  2.0 has capabilities like being able to run 4k 120 hertz or sorry hdmi 2.0 is lacking capabilities like
[1888.58 --> 1895.86]  running 4k 120 hertz that hdmi 2.1 has and that might be nice to have not technically okay but
[1896.66 --> 1903.30]  used to have yeah that i used to be able to say that yeah so if i was apple do i jump on this i
[1903.30 --> 1913.06]  go oh this is sick we got hdmi 2.1 now up in here upgrade and on this laptop you can run
[1914.10 --> 1922.34]  two 5k displays and one 4k display plus the internal display is that how i spec my laptop 100
[1923.14 --> 1929.62]  and as a consumer i'm now going to have to figure out later that in order to run those high resolution
[1929.62 --> 1937.86]  or high refresh rate displays i'm going to have to use a dongle no what i had wanted to do was use
[1937.86 --> 1945.22]  the hdmi port that you put on the product i wanted to have them you said it was hdmi 2.1 this will
[1945.22 --> 1951.54]  cause confusion oh yeah and to be clear apple is far from the only one that is going to take advantage of
[1951.54 --> 1956.50]  this anyone who's using example yeah anyone who's using like uh who's trying to get rid of old stock or is
[1956.50 --> 1961.70]  uh you know shipping a laptop that has an integrated gpu that doesn't have support for
[1962.74 --> 1969.22]  what used to be the the standard formerly known as hdmi 2.1 uh they're absolutely going to take
[1969.22 --> 1978.02]  advantage of this and it's going to be so hard to comparison shop devices so hard to comparison shop
[1978.02 --> 1985.86]  devices if i want to know at a glance that's why we need labs what the benefit is of you know the the
[1985.86 --> 1992.66]  450 chromebook versus the 389 chromebook and both of them say hdmi 2.1 and i go buy the cheaper one
[1992.66 --> 1997.86]  and i find out that okay maybe there's no real reason on a device like that to run 4k 120 hertz
[1998.42 --> 2004.10]  but if i find out for whatever reason that it can't do it i'm going to be choked because maybe i would
[2004.10 --> 2010.18]  have spent the extra 60 bucks i mean there's people that want smoothness of desktop experiences
[2010.18 --> 2016.90]  absolutely and like that it could absolutely or just like ultra fine resolutions yeah right yeah
[2018.34 --> 2026.02]  i'm i i'm so i'm so frustrated the the uh this is oh okay jonathan horst prepared this one apparently
[2026.02 --> 2031.22]  discussion question i can just i can hear it in his voice why do these standards bodies keep renaming
[2031.22 --> 2038.82]  established standards do they you wrote it like a script yeah do they not have to ever explain to
[2038.82 --> 2044.74]  their families why their tv isn't working as advertised see you bought an hdmi 2.1 cable
[2044.74 --> 2050.02]  that doesn't support variable refresh rate so you need to go buy one that does okay the cable oh my god
[2051.14 --> 2058.98]  are you going to be able to have an hdmi 2.1 certified cable that doesn't do whatever the like encoding
[2059.94 --> 2061.38]  bitrate whatever bandwidth
[2064.18 --> 2064.42]  no
[2068.82 --> 2074.66]  okay does this bring back the the weird shady premium cable market
[2076.66 --> 2082.18]  labs is the solution yeah we're just going to have to prove cables approved device we are going to
[2082.18 --> 2092.02]  actually have to just outright reject like so part of the goal of labs is that we want to create our own
[2092.02 --> 2098.74]  spec sheet for a product we want to basically take what the manufacturer says and without without all the
[2098.74 --> 2104.90]  the overhead of reading a review necessarily i think we're we're going to editorialize in the video
[2104.90 --> 2111.78]  content that accompanies a device but without all of that the the at a glance is we want to create a
[2111.78 --> 2118.50]  new spec sheet a better spec sheet so we'll take the manufacturer spec sheet that says rtx 3080 and we're
[2118.50 --> 2127.62]  going to say oh yeah right but what thermal envelope does it actually run in um how loud does it get
[2127.62 --> 2136.58]  when it does that um and we want to find a way to make it glanceable right so that you can look at one
[2136.58 --> 2145.38]  of these devices and you can go okay thank goodness i can finally actually compare this stuff and so you know
[2145.38 --> 2151.94]  i thought that something like io was going to be relatively straightforward usb3 was going to be
[2151.94 --> 2160.02]  as simple as how many gigabits the port is usb3 however many gigabits times however many etc yeah
[2160.02 --> 2167.22]  now hdmi all of a sudden we're going to have to start doing it in like gigabit per second it's it's
[2167.22 --> 2172.58]  that simple that's that's that's that's what we're going to have to do yeah it has it has an hdmi
[2172.58 --> 2181.62]  18 point whatever hdmi man hdmi 2.1 gigabit per second maximum hopefully displayport doesn't do
[2181.62 --> 2189.78]  this crap please don't 48 gigabits per second right so you'll just say hdmi 48 gbps do we give
[2189.78 --> 2196.42]  like some form of award or stamp or something to a product that is very well communicated
[2196.42 --> 2202.18]  i don't think so i don't want to i that's you know it's funny it's funny you bring it up because
[2202.18 --> 2207.14]  awards are something that i have to do that in the past yeah always avoided yeah and the reason
[2207.14 --> 2212.34]  i've avoided it is because i don't believe the story of any product is as simple as a gold stamp
[2213.06 --> 2220.42]  i i don't even it could be like i don't know iron colored because all it is all the the only thing i
[2220.42 --> 2226.82]  would want it to say is that it lived up to the specs that it claimed i don't want it to say that
[2226.82 --> 2231.30]  it's a good product i don't want to say that you should buy it it's just they said it would do these
[2231.30 --> 2238.66]  things and it does good job yeah i think having like uh like a like a bs like a smell test like a
[2238.66 --> 2244.82]  bs rating of you know a b or c yeah or d for like a fail it's probably how good it is if it's recommended
[2244.82 --> 2250.26]  whatever that could be all on the the video side right that's for ltd that's for short circuit that's for
[2250.26 --> 2256.74]  whoever they can try to communicate those things labs just goes like they didn't lie good job yeah
[2256.74 --> 2261.94]  i could see something like that and i don't maybe it's maybe it's dumb i just i know there's there's
[2261.94 --> 2267.22]  a lot of products that kind of bs about stuff especially in their like amazon product name you
[2267.22 --> 2276.42]  know so i don't know you know what we should do sponsors yeah no bs here all right the show is

[2423.54 --> 2429.94]  very nice yeah so it's meant to be kind of like uh like uh like a like a like just a cozy lounger yeah
[2429.94 --> 2435.78]  i'm not going i'm not going outside you know i'm not going to be out in the the rain snow sleet or hail or
[2435.78 --> 2441.06]  whatever else i just want something comfy to throw on something in between like a thicker hoodie and a
[2441.06 --> 2447.06]  long sleeve light shirt um just kind of keep you keep you a little bit warm when you're sitting still
[2447.06 --> 2453.14]  and gaming for hours at a time it's available in two colors this and this gray and dark aqua apparently
[2453.14 --> 2461.22]  that's what we're calling them uh so luke and i are wearing both of them 100 coverage okay that is not
[2461.22 --> 2467.94]  that is that might be too much look at that booty i had to like make sure that was you before i said
[2470.90 --> 2475.70]  because if it's me it's like not sexual harassment yeah okay you're fine with it
[2478.98 --> 2479.22]  wow
[2481.46 --> 2485.94]  cancelled in three two one here we go boys
[2485.94 --> 2494.82]  oh no oh man okay so uh there you go it's uh it's a thing that you guys can uh you guys can
[2494.82 --> 2501.78]  go check out lttstore.com and let's move on to our next topic here i was pretty sure i decided to verify
[2501.78 --> 2510.34]  i want to talk about the dell luna concept laptop this is super cool here's dell's blog post and uh the the
[2510.34 --> 2517.94]  i think the title here says it all pushing the boundaries of sustainable pc design concept luna
[2517.94 --> 2523.54]  sort of well we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail full disclosure before we jump into
[2523.54 --> 2531.30]  this topic i am an investor in framework laptops who is also striving to make a more repairable uh more
[2531.30 --> 2539.94]  sustainable laptop and actually has a product so that's something i reached out to dell and i have i
[2539.94 --> 2546.18]  have asked now multiple times to get hands on with this thing because i am extremely interested i
[2546.18 --> 2554.02]  want to cover it i want to talk about it and the answer has been categorically no we will not give
[2554.02 --> 2561.14]  you any hands-on with this which leads me to believe that it may not be as far along as i would like it to
[2561.14 --> 2567.38]  be right i am still really excited about a lot of the stuff that they're talking about here so it was
[2567.38 --> 2572.18]  designed in collaboration with intel and has a focus on eco-friendliness and repairability
[2572.18 --> 2578.26]  how you might ask all right let's get you through that so first is reducing the carbon footprint of
[2578.26 --> 2583.06]  the product through manufacturing changes like reducing the size of the motherboard by 75 percent
[2584.18 --> 2587.38]  okay yeah but the trend towards smaller motherboards because they're just trying to
[2587.38 --> 2593.06]  make thinner laptops has been a thing for a long time but uh and reducing component counts by 20 percent
[2593.06 --> 2597.30]  dell claims this could reduce the carbon footprint of the motherboard by 50 percent yeah that seems
[2597.70 --> 2602.66]  that seems pretty reasonable using less materials definitely a plus this is cool moving the
[2602.66 --> 2607.38]  motherboard to the display portion of the laptop which would put it closer to the outside of the
[2607.38 --> 2612.74]  chassis and improve heat dissipation now it's very clear from hearing that that this is not the kind
[2612.74 --> 2617.62]  of product that would be in the performance tier this would be something that would be in more like a
[2617.62 --> 2624.10]  biz like a b2b yeah a chromebook sort of class of product uh if you're expecting to
[2624.10 --> 2629.86]  to presumably passively cool it and if you're going to have light enough components that the whole
[2629.86 --> 2633.94]  thing isn't going to tip over like a lot of the convertibles that we saw over the years
[2634.98 --> 2641.22]  uh batteries with advanced deep cycle cells this one i'm really interested in because if we could
[2641.22 --> 2647.54]  have batteries that lasted longer obviously that's going to be a freaking plus stamped aluminum
[2647.54 --> 2653.86]  construction to minimize scrap this is something that i i have been man i'm i've been very torn
[2653.86 --> 2660.26]  about over the years i don't know if i've really talked about it but machined like one unibody aluminum
[2660.26 --> 2667.06]  chassis which uh apple famously uh popularized back with man what what generation would that have been
[2667.06 --> 2670.90]  sorry i don't remember off the top of my head but i don't know if apple was the first to do it but
[2670.90 --> 2677.22]  boy were they ever the first to do it well when they released their first unibody mac with basically
[2677.22 --> 2682.74]  the keyboard side down and then the whole thing is just machined out giving it this rigidity that we
[2682.74 --> 2689.62]  just hadn't seen before like those things were they were such a game changer right the problem is that
[2690.26 --> 2697.30]  all that aluminum yeah you just you remove it from this block of aluminum to create what is
[2697.30 --> 2702.66]  essentially an empty shell and you're you're utterly shredding it which while yeah okay yes
[2702.66 --> 2708.50]  you can you can melt it back down and you can you can create a new block of aluminum out of the shreds
[2708.50 --> 2715.38]  but there's there's a lot of overhead there's a lot of energy involved in that process and it's not that simple
[2716.34 --> 2724.66]  um so switching to stamped aluminum presuming that they can still keep excellent structural rigidity could be an
[2724.66 --> 2730.10]  excellent way to not create as much scrap aluminum they've got fewer layers in the display and then
[2730.10 --> 2735.78]  when we get into reusing repairing and recycling they want to reduce the number of screws in the
[2735.78 --> 2742.50]  device from hundreds to just four for more convenience and shorter repair times sure and
[2742.50 --> 2748.34]  they've designed a new pcb made with flax fiber in the base and water soluble polymer as glue allowing
[2748.34 --> 2753.86]  recyclers to more easily separate metal and components that is super cool
[2756.10 --> 2761.30]  forgive me if i turn my nose up i have not watched lewis rossman's video yet and maybe i'm
[2761.30 --> 2766.58]  maybe i'm well out of uh well of turn here oh did rossman make a video already apparently there is one
[2766.58 --> 2774.42]  someone someone in the chat mentioned that there is one of course he did yeah um but i just tell drs guys tldrs
[2774.42 --> 2781.14]  us yeah let us know what he has to say but i i don't see anything on here about uh replacement
[2781.14 --> 2785.94]  parts i don't see anything on here about schematics i don't see anything on here that has anything to do
[2785.94 --> 2792.50]  with sustainability other than things that would immediately save them money which is great if you
[2792.50 --> 2797.54]  can do both if you can save yourself money and be more sustainable for the environment it really raises
[2797.54 --> 2801.86]  the question why you didn't do it why weren't you doing this already but dell has done things in the
[2801.86 --> 2807.86]  past dell has had laptops with uh swappable cpus dell has had laptops with like huge panels on the
[2807.86 --> 2812.34]  bottom where you can swap out a very large amount of things maybe it's not as swappable or maintainable
[2812.34 --> 2817.38]  as a as a framework laptop but there was genuinely like you could swap the cpu you could swap the ramp
[2817.38 --> 2821.62]  you could swap the drives and they had these panels this was really common back then they had these
[2821.62 --> 2826.98]  panels were that would show a symbol for the thing that was under it so they'd have like this is the ram
[2826.98 --> 2831.54]  panel it's one screw to remove that and you know what now that they're down to four screws that sounds
[2831.54 --> 2840.90]  great that's cool but this really is like i feel like it's a it's a far from far enough i think that's
[2840.90 --> 2847.62]  fair um something that we haven't talked about enough is there are actually conventional or like
[2847.62 --> 2854.66]  traditional laptop manufacturers that are doing a way better job than sort of i i think someone like
[2854.66 --> 2858.50]  a like an apple is at this point i don't think they're at the point where they provide actual
[2858.50 --> 2865.06]  schematics for their main boards but hp has excellent resources that anyone can access that includes uh
[2865.06 --> 2870.26]  teardown guides for many of their laptops i don't know if it includes all their consumer stuff but i know
[2870.26 --> 2874.74]  that a lot of their business stuff does have resources like that available again i don't know how
[2874.74 --> 2885.78]  will they archive it um but i think that what dell is what dell is doing here here's my most positive
[2885.78 --> 2892.90]  spin on it what dell is doing here is they are joining the conversation yeah and this is a really
[2892.90 --> 2898.02]  important conversation i feel like they're listening from outside the door we need to not yeah but the thing
[2898.02 --> 2906.26]  is we need to not be one of those communities that says you know what you're not a good enough ally you
[2906.26 --> 2915.54]  should ally better so i think what we should do is we should take every ally we can get and applaud
[2916.18 --> 2923.06]  everything that they do that is good while continuing to call out everything they do that is suspect
[2923.86 --> 2929.54]  so i want to see like you said i want to see yeah availability of schematics i want to see a
[2929.54 --> 2934.82]  commitment to that i want to see a commitment like framework has made to allowing these motherboards
[2934.82 --> 2943.30]  to live a new life in a thin and light chassis as a desktop right so i want to see that too i want to see
[2944.02 --> 2949.70]  i want to see more i want to see hands-on with it i want to know if this is a science fair project it
[2949.70 --> 2954.98]  feels like it okay so i i do agree with you i just reading this it really does feel like a science fair
[2954.98 --> 2959.62]  project and without schematics and without replacement parts honestly a lot of the things that they did to
[2959.62 --> 2967.78]  make it more environmentally friendly which is cool and good sounds like it's going to uh hurt its
[2967.78 --> 2973.78]  longevity as a product they sound like things that could result in the bricking or death of the device
[2973.78 --> 2980.74]  quicker and more easily and if you if it's not easier to repair alongside that then this might not
[2980.74 --> 2987.54]  even reduce waste yeah so like i'm really not sold i i i appreciate that they're trying but like i feel
[2987.54 --> 2991.46]  like there's some really big things missing here and the fact they're not letting anyone see it there's
[2991.46 --> 2998.82]  no schematics whatever is like is this even a thing like i i i i want to see more i'm definitely
[2998.82 --> 3004.50]  i i'm open to the conversation if dell pushes this forward if they do schematics if they hopefully
[3004.50 --> 3009.54]  um if they hopefully announce that they're oh we're going to do some replacement like actually
[3009.54 --> 3015.38]  going to do this instead of just like oh we're going to try to transition by 2030. yeah then that's
[3015.38 --> 3021.94]  awesome heck yes you don't have to do it exactly the same way that framework does sure if you get part
[3021.94 --> 3026.26]  of the way there that's still really cool but i'm not necessarily even convinced this is part of the
[3026.26 --> 3031.06]  way there right like straight up just reading this this purely just sounds like a really cheap
[3031.70 --> 3039.14]  to manufacture low-end laptop yeah that they are luckily able to say is sustainable which is cool
[3039.14 --> 3042.74]  but i'm not even convinced of that because a lot of the things that they're talking about make it
[3042.74 --> 3049.78]  sound like it's gonna get damaged really easily which is concerning when it's not more repairable so i i
[3049.78 --> 3055.94]  don't know so that's fair maybe i'm totally out to lunch hopefully i am honestly i mean yeah so just to
[3055.94 --> 3062.82]  be clear guys dell isn't committing to release this tomorrow this is a concept um if if anything this
[3062.82 --> 3070.74]  is the kind of thing that they're saying hey maybe in the next 10 years but again back to not wanting to
[3070.74 --> 3077.30]  to to crap on someone who is at least drawing attention to this problem true um dell could have
[3077.30 --> 3083.86]  easily just kept their mouth shut yeah because drawing attention to this making people think about you
[3083.86 --> 3090.82]  know sustainability in laptops like here let's do a little exercise i have not done this sustainable
[3090.82 --> 3098.42]  laptop okay what am i going to find oh good dell bought an ad uh i'm going to find leafscore.com i have
[3098.42 --> 3106.58]  no idea what the heck leafscore.com is okay it's all dell stuff oh for crying out loud well it feels like
[3106.58 --> 3113.14]  marketing for a very cheap to manufacture laptop okay so the only thing other than dell we've got an hp buyer's
[3113.14 --> 3120.18]  guide and we've got a framework article framework sustainable diy so dell could dell could have just
[3120.18 --> 3128.26]  kept their mouths shut and they could have just focused on products that they're actually selling
[3128.26 --> 3132.82]  right because on the one hand yes they're creating positive headlines for their company and for their
[3132.82 --> 3137.30]  brand but on the other hand they're creating all of those positive headlines for something that generates
[3137.30 --> 3144.34]  them literally zero revenue the only other option the only options on this page to actually buy anything
[3144.98 --> 3153.94]  are an hp sustainability shopping guide that as far as i can tell is just a bunch of spectre laptops
[3154.90 --> 3158.82]  like this this is just a product page um
[3158.82 --> 3169.06]  uh yeah uh okay they're energy star certified sure all right hp uh or an article about the framework so
[3169.06 --> 3174.66]  out of things you can actually buy zero of them are dell so we shouldn't discourage dell from talking about
[3174.66 --> 3181.86]  this stuff we want them to we we want them to talk about it we want them to make people aware of it
[3181.86 --> 3190.10]  all right so that's that's the deal with project luna oh actually there's a couple of discussion
[3190.10 --> 3195.38]  topics here from our new writer who hasn't passed probation yet which of these features would you
[3195.38 --> 3199.94]  most like to see implemented into your laptop is one of the discussion topics and maybe more
[3199.94 --> 3204.98]  importantly dell has eschewed investigating the upgradability aspect that is a core part of
[3204.98 --> 3212.42]  frameworks design philosophy why do you think that is does easy upgradability perhaps encourage consumer
[3212.42 --> 3218.02]  wastefulness should people not just buy exactly what they need at the time if they're able to
[3219.06 --> 3222.82]  rather than taking a module out and putting a new module that's not what they're doing
[3223.54 --> 3231.22]  consumers yeah well i think if your sales pitch is hey you know buy this and then like you know add
[3231.22 --> 3235.70]  stuff to it later and then chuck that other stuff it depends as long as there's a clear as long as
[3235.70 --> 3240.74]  there's a clear ongoing purpose for that thing that you're getting rid of or if there's like a
[3240.74 --> 3247.86]  a downstream use for it like um okay my urra ring for example i just upgraded to the gen 3 and uh for the
[3247.86 --> 3252.58]  gen 2 because i mean it's like sized to you right like there's the odds of you knowing someone who will
[3252.58 --> 3258.02]  fit exactly the same ring size i mean they're not zero but they're also not infinitely large um they've got
[3258.02 --> 3263.38]  a program where they will send you a prepaid shipping label you just chuck your gen 2 ring in a box and
[3263.38 --> 3270.10]  then they donate it to um to programs that are doing like sleep and activity monitoring studies and stuff
[3270.10 --> 3276.82]  like that um so they've created this clear downstream purpose for it that sounds really cool that makes
[3276.82 --> 3280.50]  me feel like okay yeah i'm upgrading for a feature that quite frankly i don't really need
[3281.94 --> 3287.22]  but as long as that other one will continue to be used and will continue to sort of contribute in some
[3287.22 --> 3292.10]  meaningful way then i'm i'm content with that so i i don't want framework to fall into a trap where
[3292.10 --> 3298.02]  they're like oh yeah you know just buy the entry level one today so we're essentially manufacturing
[3298.02 --> 3304.82]  scrap and then throw away the pieces as you upgrade it later like those those types of messages do exist
[3304.82 --> 3310.82]  and i i don't want that to be it i'm not saying they're doing that now at all yeah um but i'm saying
[3310.82 --> 3320.10]  that upgradability is not just obviously the answer it's not necessarily a good thing if i think if
[3321.06 --> 3325.94]  uh and this might be an absolute pipe dream probably is to be very clear but i think if there was
[3325.94 --> 3332.90]  somehow standards to certain components within you know how like ram yep right if that was spread out a
[3332.90 --> 3338.18]  little bit further to more components sure then you could end up with places like free geek just having a
[3338.18 --> 3342.42]  bunch of components for laptops and they can rebuild things together yeah for sure yeah i could see
[3342.42 --> 3346.74]  that as long as there's like heavy uniqueness within laptops which has been a thing forever
[3346.74 --> 3355.54]  um yeah it's tough gonna be pretty hard yeah it's pretty tough so good luck um meanwhile microsoft
[3355.54 --> 3360.90]  want to talk us through this one uh sure sorry there's merch messages are going ham so maybe yeah i'm on
[3360.90 --> 3366.18]  it i'm on it uh microsoft leans further into right to repair we got another one of these topics microsoft is
[3366.18 --> 3372.98]  teaming up with ifixit ifixit's pro independent repairers uh microsoft authorized service providers
[3372.98 --> 3379.46]  microsoft experience centers and microsoft commercial customers uh can now purchase official service tools
[3379.46 --> 3385.06]  for surface devices directly from ifixit not available directly to consumers
[3387.94 --> 3395.62]  i'm surprised ifixit greenlit that me too i don't i skimmed this topic i did not read that one bullet point
[3395.62 --> 3403.62]  and that lifts a pretty heavy eyebrow but maybe eventually um three custom tools along with weights
[3403.62 --> 3409.62]  and accessories will be designed by microsoft and manufactured by ifixit interesting uh they're
[3409.62 --> 3415.06]  primarily for de-bonding and rebonding of materials for select microsoft surface models
[3415.06 --> 3419.78]  not necessary to perform the repairs but should be helpful to ensure they're done without error which
[3419.78 --> 3425.22]  they're very prone to when you're doing that type of repair um i added that little thing at the end
[3425.22 --> 3430.02]  discussion question should the standardized should the standard instead be that you should be able
[3430.02 --> 3434.50]  to take most items apart without specialized tools like this yes it's a step in the right direction
[3434.50 --> 3441.06]  but home users can't buy it and now repair shops need to buy more specialty tools it's also very odd
[3441.06 --> 3446.98]  that it's designed by microsoft and manufactured by ifixit it sounds like microsoft is trying to buy
[3446.98 --> 3453.46]  approval i'm not trying to be negative nancy guy today but like what the heck this is really weird
[3453.46 --> 3459.54]  so one thing i might say is if we look at the timeline for when microsoft said they would do
[3459.54 --> 3466.42]  their investigation into repairability and this is now this is quick at least they're doing something
[3466.42 --> 3472.26]  oh yeah so the the fact that it's happened this one i will absolutely give them the like the fact
[3472.26 --> 3476.66]  that it's happening at all is a positive i will totally give them that it's just it's just really
[3476.66 --> 3481.94]  weird i don't know why they don't make it available to everyone microsoft can absolutely manufacture
[3481.94 --> 3487.30]  things themselves i'm not saying i fix it is i fix it's great i have nothing negative to say about i
[3487.30 --> 3497.62]  fix it yeah well i mean this is something like they're complicit now so in in my opinion um they're
[3497.62 --> 3502.50]  complicit in it not being available to consumers they're they're complicit in it not just being generally
[3502.50 --> 3508.18]  available yeah um i and i suspect this is kind of a fraught political issue over at microsoft right
[3508.18 --> 3514.18]  now this is purely speculation this is purely my personal suspicion but when we bent the bottom of
[3514.18 --> 3521.94]  our surface pro whatever the last laptop uh surface laptop pro surface laptop number whatever it is so i
[3521.94 --> 3526.90]  can never keep track of their their model names they're very confusing um anyway when we bent the bottom
[3526.90 --> 3532.42]  lid of it we contacted microsoft we said hey we'd like to just buy a lid and it was part
[3532.42 --> 3536.42]  partly it was a test it was like hey are you gonna like make parts available in case something gets
[3536.42 --> 3540.90]  damaged because it happens and they were like no that is absolutely not a thing that is available
[3540.90 --> 3545.62]  under any circumstances not even to you and i was like oh good we're off to do a good start here um
[3546.26 --> 3554.18]  now i i i i sent a follow-up email i was like hey okay well you know hopefully you know you guys aren't too
[3554.82 --> 3560.98]  frustrated by you know what it was partially our fault that we we damaged it you know we we're not like
[3560.98 --> 3564.34]  trying to destroy your product that's not the kind of channel we are we are we're not tech racks that's
[3564.34 --> 3574.90]  not our jam right um i straight up never got a reply just nothing i'm like oh okay well um cool you know
[3574.90 --> 3579.30]  if we have to buy microsoft products to tear them apart in the future then we'll do that but hopefully
[3579.30 --> 3591.78]  we can hopefully we can hopefully we're still cool um yeah i just uh yeah i don't i don't like that i fix it
[3591.78 --> 3602.02]  is profiting from a program that restricts inherently restricts access to the tools they're profiting from
[3602.02 --> 3606.98]  and it would i'd be way cooler with it if they were like you know what we're just getting manufacturing
[3606.98 --> 3611.46]  spun up we don't have enough for everyone we're starting with commercial customers first it's
[3611.46 --> 3617.86]  going to be available more open later there's also the the the potential the conversation at least
[3617.86 --> 3622.34]  because i fix it has basically come out and said look microsoft stuff is like it's basically repair
[3622.34 --> 3628.42]  ability score zero yeah you should not try to repair this yeah so if they came out and they said well
[3628.42 --> 3635.86]  here's the thing microsoft's current crop of products honestly only pros should be repairing these things
[3635.86 --> 3641.94]  we are working hard to create a well-equipped network of pros but we're working with microsoft
[3641.94 --> 3647.14]  where future products will be way better look i'm saying it could be a situation where at least they're
[3647.14 --> 3652.58]  doing what they can do now i don't like that this creates a very significant conflict of interest
[3652.58 --> 3658.26]  though yeah and i don't like it it ain't a little one i don't like like you can give people warnings
[3658.26 --> 3664.34]  but i don't like stopping people from sharing that's always been a bit of a pet peeve yeah
[3666.26 --> 3674.26]  okay so i don't think pushing the incoming ones that are timed out is working is there
[3675.54 --> 3680.98]  it's not i don't think so they don't they don't move maybe they work for you uh what's our next next
[3680.98 --> 3686.82]  topic here though there's actually a few sort of little things that we don't have like a full
[3687.46 --> 3693.70]  thing written out for but um hunter ap in the float plane chat was asking hey linus and luke did
[3693.70 --> 3700.58]  you hear about tick tock's studio live apparently using obs code yeah i i i knew they were using well
[3700.58 --> 3705.70]  the second that it came out that they had streaming software i was like oh so they're using obs i didn't
[3705.70 --> 3709.94]  even like think about it i also didn't realize they were using it illegally until we were sitting down
[3709.94 --> 3714.98]  here so i don't have a lot of information on it but could obs just catch a break yeah really at some
[3714.98 --> 3719.62]  point i feel like everyone's just trolling them at this point like should we should we release should
[3719.62 --> 3730.90]  we release linus obs yeah yeah yeah the obs l l t t o b s just be and then it's just there's like
[3730.90 --> 3737.14]  nothing changed except it's black and orange yeah when they contact us with a cease and desist we'll just
[3737.14 --> 3742.58]  be like yeah we were just kidding guys just take the site sorry just redirect it to their site like
[3742.58 --> 3749.54]  here we felt like you needed a w so we went in we were rude and then you can just you guys can you
[3749.54 --> 3754.90]  can tweet about how you like shut it down yeah yeah just we'll do a logan paul jake paul we'll make a
[3754.90 --> 3761.78]  fake fight yeah exactly we'll have beef it up we'll have internet beef yeah and then you guys can can
[3761.78 --> 3766.74]  big deal win yeah uh zatharian says obs needs to close their source if they don't want people using
[3766.74 --> 3772.66]  it no no no no no no no obs needs to be what they are they need to continue to be the awesome open
[3772.66 --> 3777.46]  source project they are because if they weren't open source anymore they'd really need to change the
[3777.46 --> 3787.30]  name that's that's like that that's what the o is um uh and but people need to just respect the license
[3787.30 --> 3795.30]  of their open source product it's that simple uh gamer inc on twitter said poor obs is like the smart
[3795.30 --> 3802.74]  kid everyone wants for the group project who just does all the work that's pretty good yeah you know
[3802.74 --> 3807.46]  what maybe we should just like can you donate to obs maybe i'll just donate to obs right now why don't
[3807.46 --> 3812.18]  we why don't we send a donation how the heck do you how the heck do you send a donation to obs
[3812.18 --> 3822.10]  contribute here it is okay um patreon can i just like okay via paypal i apparently can just
[3822.66 --> 3833.06]  i apparently can just send money via paypal okay oh my my wife uh has the paypal uh 2fa so i'm gonna do
[3833.06 --> 3840.02]  it later but i'm i'm i'm pledging i'm pledging a thousand dollars to op obs because i feel like i feel
[3840.02 --> 3846.18]  like obs has had a you know month here and we have been using them for years at this point yeah
[3846.18 --> 3852.18]  okay nice okay thousand to obs please you know what i'm actually just gonna send it to the accounting
[3852.18 --> 3858.42]  department instead of my wife hey um good yeah because that's easier then she won't have to deal
[3858.42 --> 3864.26]  with that yeah okay okay we're just gonna we're just gonna do this okay cool sorry i just have to do
[3864.26 --> 3868.34]  this before i forget otherwise i'll forget and i don't want to be that person that's like yeah i'm gonna
[3868.34 --> 3873.70]  like donate something and then i don't do it but it's not because i was malicious because i was just
[3874.42 --> 3884.34]  a scatterbrain and forgot time not to be a terrible person um all right let's go ahead and but but
[3885.54 --> 3895.70]  gizmodo this is the funniest thing i've read on gizmodo ever oh so hey those anti-5g radiation necklaces
[3895.70 --> 3898.42]  are actually radioactive
[3898.42 --> 3908.66]  oh how much not very because like bananas are radioactive not very very low but if worn
[3908.66 --> 3913.78]  continuously apparently could cause prolonged so
[3917.94 --> 3923.94]  so according to the netherlands authority for nuclear safety and radiation protection anvs
[3923.94 --> 3931.94]  um the levels of ionizing radiation detected are low and the risk is very small but they are
[3931.94 --> 3937.22]  potentially harmful to anyone wearing the product for an extended period of time and they specifically
[3937.22 --> 3945.30]  mentioned red skin as a potential symptom of prolonged exposure oh my goodness imagine buying snake oil
[3945.30 --> 3955.30]  oil drinking it and being like oh what snake oil is not good for human consumption i don't feel so good mr stark
[3955.30 --> 3963.22]  how on earth could this completely unregulated quack medicine cottage industry have possibly caused any
[3963.22 --> 3970.42]  kinds of health problems i mean at least if you're just wearing amethysts you're not actively harming yourself
[3970.42 --> 3976.58]  yeah yeah you're just or if you you know a whole bunch of pounds of it in your computer like like
[3976.58 --> 3983.14]  it's it's a good thing at least if someone's wearing like you know a big amethyst like head shield you can
[3983.14 --> 3991.14]  see them and be like you know what we probably have nothing in common i can just stay away and it's gonna be okay
[3991.14 --> 3996.58]  everyone's gonna be fine in this scenario you can 100 percent not genuinely doesn't bother anyone yeah
[3996.58 --> 4005.78]  oh man it's just it's just terrible gizmodo gizmodo uh iclone yeah you gotta head over there have a
[4005.78 --> 4011.30]  read through the whole article we didn't do any prep on this one we're just kind of pointing you at that
[4011.30 --> 4015.46]  uh did you want to talk about log4j at all or you just don't want to talk about it i think it's been a
[4015.46 --> 4019.46]  little beat to death if you care about it at all this week but what it's something that i think i might
[4019.46 --> 4024.74]  be able to add to the conversation i don't think necessarily everyone's talking about uh is that if you had
[4024.74 --> 4033.38]  a server or service or whatever that had issues with apache log4j you should look into uh the
[4033.38 --> 4038.18]  concept or idea that someone could have used that vulnerability already in a way that you don't
[4038.18 --> 4042.10]  necessarily know and they could exploit that vulnerability with backdoors or something
[4042.10 --> 4049.54]  further down the line we are very very far from done uh in regards to talking about the impact of the
[4049.54 --> 4056.66]  log4j issues because they are going to spring up later i can pretty much guarantee it because people
[4056.66 --> 4063.30]  are seeding things right now that they will exploit later when they want to um so be careful and if
[4063.30 --> 4070.42]  you're on a big team you need to look into uh the the potentials of of these vulnerabilities being
[4070.42 --> 4074.50]  exploited already and if you're on a small team it's genuinely not a bad idea to go into
[4074.50 --> 4085.94]  uh like uh attack defense mode now to try to find it so be aware don't don't get caught um because
[4086.74 --> 4093.22]  just because things feel fine right now it's very likely that they won't be also uh be careful with
[4094.02 --> 4100.90]  patching uh fixes into things that are very very very new and were created very very very quickly
[4100.90 --> 4106.82]  because the uh the first fix for log4j had other vulnerabilities in it so i mean what's your
[4106.82 --> 4111.78]  solution to that though what are you supposed to do not patch it there's there's potentially other
[4111.78 --> 4120.10]  things that you can do like not using it um but but also also just being hyper aware because it it yeah
[4120.10 --> 4125.70]  it allows people to connect and do bad things so just i hope you enjoy the overtime i don't know
[4125.70 --> 4133.86]  yeah that's about it this just don't think it's over and if you if you work somewhere and they're
[4133.86 --> 4139.38]  like oh yeah we applied the patch it's good we're good you're not good and don't think that it's over
[4140.34 --> 4145.06]  all right uh timo's uh merch message is hilarious uh you guys will see this in a second but i'm gonna
[4145.06 --> 4150.18]  put it up there i ruined christmas i was about to place an order when the so came running in all me
[4150.18 --> 4157.62]  uh she had already bought a whole heap of ltd swag for me for christmas i ruined the surprise well i
[4157.62 --> 4162.98]  wanted more love you guys and all your vids keep up the i don't know and then it cuts off but uh picked
[4162.98 --> 4172.18]  up the uh indoor hoodie in gray so uh enjoy enjoy um i did want to talk about the dislike restorer extension
[4172.18 --> 4180.50]  so you guys might have noticed that youtube removed full api access to their uh to their dislike
[4180.50 --> 4190.50]  counter on i believe it was the 12th which means that any new videos do not have a an actual reported
[4190.50 --> 4197.70]  by youtube dislike counter however if you've got the dislike restorer extension you might have noticed that
[4197.70 --> 4204.10]  you didn't notice anything that's because over the last i mean since youtube made the announcement
[4204.10 --> 4211.46]  apparently something like five billion videos dislike counters were backed up and are still
[4211.46 --> 4217.86]  accessible through the extension so that if i were to click on something like this um
[4219.22 --> 4224.18]  oh is this sasha baron cohen what's this character bruno bruno bruno character i could see that the like
[4224.18 --> 4229.54]  dislike ratio on this video is actually very good and is probably quality because it's sasha baron cohen
[4229.54 --> 4236.42]  which i know already because it's sasha baron cohen but also it's got a 99 like dislike ratio which to
[4236.42 --> 4244.02]  be clear is not the only signal that you should look at but if it's got 4.7 million views it has a high
[4244.66 --> 4250.34]  like to view ratio and has a high like to dislike ratio it probably saves me the trouble of scrolling down
[4250.34 --> 4257.14]  to the comment section to see a possibly curated comment section and try to sift through that to
[4257.14 --> 4263.78]  figure out if the video is worth my one minute and 36 seconds or not um and what's really cool is they
[4263.78 --> 4275.78]  are actually using what little they have of publicly available cues to attempt to keep some semblance of a
[4275.78 --> 4285.86]  dislike counter along with some kind of hopefully indicator of its hopefully accuracy yeah uh based
[4285.86 --> 4293.30]  on users of the extension disliking so between users of the extension using it things like like to view
[4293.30 --> 4301.14]  ratios um hopefully in the future at some point they could also examine comment sentiment or look for
[4301.14 --> 4308.42]  comments with tons of upvotes that are like dislike um in order to restore dislike functionality so
[4309.22 --> 4314.82]  i don't typically come out and endorse a browser extension because the thing about browser extensions
[4314.82 --> 4320.82]  is that they could be doing all kinds of nefarious tracking yeah um especially if they're monitoring
[4320.82 --> 4324.90]  your youtube watch history i mean think about how valuable that data is to google you think it's not
[4324.90 --> 4330.50]  valuable to someone else so i'm not going to endorse it but i will tell you guys that
[4330.50 --> 4338.26]  i intend to use it me too so yeah i feel the same way about browser extensions but yeah definitely
[4339.46 --> 4346.74]  youtube in my opinion is way like astronomically less usable without it like i i my satisfaction with
[4346.74 --> 4354.50]  using youtube went up astronomically after installing the extension and i i i know that this dislike counter
[4354.50 --> 4363.06]  is not going to be completely accurate but i didn't use it as some kind of like like god's honest truth
[4363.06 --> 4371.30]  the quality of the video that's not how i used it indication i used it as as an indicator and so if it's
[4371.30 --> 4377.46]  at least accurate enough to give me some indication then honestly it's as useful as the dislike counter ever
[4377.46 --> 4388.42]  was anyway and i am so far pretty pleased with it here's an mkbhd video that's uh behind the scenes of the blind smartphone camera test on there
[4388.42 --> 4397.46]  the studio kind of uh behind the scenes channel with a 2200 to 15 like to dislike ratio you know what that's probably about right
[4398.58 --> 4405.30]  probably might end up with a few more because you never know someone might be a big fan of some phone that marquez was like
[4405.30 --> 4410.90]  actually i didn't think this one was that great uh or whatever right i haven't i haven't watched the video
[4410.90 --> 4414.66]  so i don't know exactly how the thing went down or what someone might get butthurt about but
[4416.02 --> 4422.98]  marquez almost never dips into 95 like dislike ratio territory so if it indicated something like that
[4422.98 --> 4427.22]  i'd i'd watch the video i'd go in i'd watch i'd be like okay what's going on here did did he do something
[4427.86 --> 4434.82]  hyper offensive like did he uh you know do a sponsored video for not a tesla again or something like that
[4434.82 --> 4441.46]  like that was a time that his community reacted quite strongly to a video that he made it's one
[4441.46 --> 4448.10]  of the only examples i can think of so i'd be looking for something really unusual and if there
[4448.10 --> 4452.66]  wasn't something like that then i would look at this and i'd go okay this is probably not working but
[4453.22 --> 4460.10]  this looks about right he's got a community that is dialed in and generally speaking the quality of
[4460.10 --> 4467.14]  the content is well it's the reason that these guys are dialed in right so this passes my sniff
[4467.14 --> 4472.58]  test anyway yeah and i mean return there's a bunch of different ones but return youtube dislike or
[4472.58 --> 4479.46]  return to youtube dislike.com uh their their source is up on github so okay so return youtube dislike is
[4479.46 --> 4484.18]  the one that i'm using yeah yeah as far as my understanding goes the main one and you can see
[4484.18 --> 4489.06]  all their source it's it's all foss everything's everything's all good and if we get enough people using
[4489.06 --> 4495.06]  it then we will actually have and and if we actively engage with the like and dislike buttons
[4495.06 --> 4499.22]  which is something that i've actually never really been motivated to do before i do it now but if we
[4499.22 --> 4504.50]  actively engage with the like and dislike buttons and we all use this extension which i am not endorsing
[4505.70 --> 4513.86]  then we basically have all the same function that we had before and youtube yeah yeah seriously like yeah
[4513.86 --> 4522.66]  i i i i actively dislike things significantly more now than i did in the past and creators are getting
[4522.66 --> 4531.06]  that information so neato so everyone wins i guess neato i wonder how many downloads this extension has
[4531.78 --> 4537.54]  millions yeah i would think so i know it's million plus i think i think for extensions it stops counting
[4537.54 --> 4544.50]  there okay i'm not certain well here let's find like uh let's let's search like btt better twitch tv
[4545.46 --> 4554.50]  uh man oh man better twitch okay why can i not i got it up ready it says four million plus so there's
[4554.50 --> 4560.02]  more for that okay we're on your screen four million plus okay so uh oh wait your screen capture is not
[4560.02 --> 4566.50]  working well we're sitting in the dark cool well it says yeah it says four million plus users on better
[4566.50 --> 4575.78]  ttv and then if i go back to um rising from the ashes says it won't work on mobile though that's
[4575.78 --> 4582.34]  what youtube's pushing i mean that's that's fair enough um yeah at least if i'm i mean really
[4583.38 --> 4587.54]  i think when i'm just browsing on mobile is not when it matters to me as much yeah although sometimes
[4587.54 --> 4591.30]  it does like a lot of the time i'll be trying to follow like a repair guide or something like that
[4591.30 --> 4596.42]  on my phone and i'll like have it next to me so no personally that's okay it still sucks it does
[4596.42 --> 4601.70]  it still sucks and if youtube could just do their job then that would be better yes but if someone
[4601.70 --> 4607.62]  else can't do their job as well but at least makes it so that i can go run to my desktop or my laptop
[4608.66 --> 4612.42]  figure out what video i'm gonna watch on my phone load it up on my phone and then go do it like fine
[4612.42 --> 4616.74]  at least there's a workaround that i shouldn't need but that i have it would be possible
[4616.74 --> 4623.62]  oh my goodness that would be horrible there's a way it would suck but there's a way that you could
[4623.62 --> 4630.90]  make it work 100 well other than like remoting into a desktop like no you could so uh yeah
[4633.22 --> 4639.14]  you could have like a a screen recorder that watches your screen and reads the title and then
[4639.14 --> 4645.70]  normalizes titles and and like puts information on top man that's an app that would have some scary
[4645.70 --> 4650.66]  permissions oh yeah you'd have to literally be watching your whole screen oh yeah yeah that's
[4650.66 --> 4654.74]  i don't think a lot of people you could like you could have it so that you open youtube through that
[4654.74 --> 4659.46]  app so when you press that app it opens up youtube and turns the screen recorder on so that it's not
[4659.46 --> 4668.34]  always there um yeah it's like a rough idea all i'm saying is it could work sorry i just punched the mic
[4668.34 --> 4676.18]  um yeah i i also i have a bit of a weird use case but i often don't trust the random guide for doing
[4676.18 --> 4681.38]  whatever i want to do on youtube right away even with dislikes showing so i'll usually browse as
[4681.38 --> 4685.94]  quickly as i can on my desktop and then find the one i want to watch and then open it on my phone and go
[4686.58 --> 4690.26]  so personally it works pretty well for me but i i realize not everyone does it that way
[4690.26 --> 4699.86]  uh hold on a second what is happening here okay why not just urls because you're watching it in an
[4699.86 --> 4705.06]  app you're watching it in the youtube app if you're watching it through a browser then you would just do
[4705.06 --> 4712.34]  it normally right uh i think it's time for us to do some merch messages what do you think uh yeah
[4712.34 --> 4722.50]  yeah heck yeah all right um do you wanna do you wanna uh okay so did we figure out what's happening
[4722.50 --> 4727.30]  with the ones that we're supposed to be able to push but they're not working uh they they pushed
[4727.86 --> 4732.74]  i'm pretty sure for me really okay so like this if i click it it doesn't do it though
[4735.38 --> 4741.22]  i think it works for me oh interesting okay where is that uh just the incoming ones there's like a ton
[4741.22 --> 4749.14]  of incoming ones for me or do they not appear for you okay then neat so i just need to go through
[4749.14 --> 4757.06]  the curated ones something's funky yeah yeah oh ken all right been a fan for a long time i was a guild
[4757.06 --> 4764.90]  mate of tyler c on wow i still miss him every day trust me man we miss him too i mean you can you can
[4764.90 --> 4774.18]  hire someone to fill a job but you can't replace someone like that it's not um it's just never it's
[4774.18 --> 4778.50]  never going to be the same it's not something it's not i shouldn't say it's not something i never thought
[4778.50 --> 4783.14]  about it is something that i thought about i remember talking to you about that like weird dream i had
[4783.14 --> 4788.10]  where like ed died and then we got like a statue and we put it in his chair because it was basically
[4788.10 --> 4792.34]  the same thing because he never talked to anyone anyway and it was like i woke up and i was like wow
[4792.34 --> 4795.86]  that was a super weird experience like it's something i thought about it's something that i
[4795.86 --> 4803.38]  didn't really like with with a team that was so young and overall healthy it's not something that i
[4803.38 --> 4809.78]  expected that we'd ever have to deal with and it was an absolute shock yeah for us i still have um
[4809.78 --> 4815.62]  around that time i was working with tyler on a new inventory system which actually we just launched
[4815.62 --> 4820.90]  with a lot of his guidance um very very recently and people seem to like it so that's very cool
[4820.90 --> 4827.14]  um but i have i i asked him if i could screen record those calls because honestly when you're
[4827.14 --> 4830.74]  discussing what someone wants from a piece of software it's often easier to just have their
[4830.74 --> 4836.10]  original words um because things can get lost in translation and stuff and i have those like i i
[4836.10 --> 4841.54]  back them up and everything but i still have them on my local system and i didn't rename the files so
[4841.54 --> 4846.66]  every once in a while when i'm like looking for a video to test and upload with on on uh float plane i'll
[4846.66 --> 4851.78]  like accidentally open that and then i hear him talk and i get big sad punched in the gut a little
[4851.78 --> 4859.86]  bit but yeah yeah for those of you who are joining us late um tyler was um one of the members of our
[4859.86 --> 4868.74]  team who unfortunately uh passed away very very unexpectedly um leaving us leaving a pretty a pretty big hole
[4868.74 --> 4880.58]  um yeah here um is the memorial stream still up somewhere i actually don't know i don't know yeah i'm not
[4880.58 --> 4886.98]  sure i mean it was one of those things where it was like really it was yeah you know what i would
[4886.98 --> 4896.26]  rather move on at this point yeah yep let's uh okay uh vinay um anyway he was great that's that's what
[4896.26 --> 4902.74]  i have to say about that vinay uh hey guys long time viewer first time caller tomorrow's my 25th birthday
[4902.74 --> 4908.82]  could i get a shout out happy birthday vinay also my beanie gets fuzzy and i think it shrank when i washed
[4908.82 --> 4915.54]  it uh anything i can do to prevent it on the next one oh okay so fuzzy i'm a little confused by because
[4915.54 --> 4922.34]  i wash mine regularly i have not had that issue um you should contact support maybe there's something
[4922.34 --> 4927.78]  wrong with yours or it could be something about your uh your washing machine like there or your
[4927.78 --> 4934.02]  dryer there there can be uh there can be aspects of those devices that can make it more likely for
[4934.02 --> 4940.66]  your clothes to pill as for the shrinking just wear it it'll it'll stretch out again every time and then
[4940.66 --> 4945.22]  when you wash it again it will shrink again and it's like fine like this one i put on this
[4945.22 --> 4951.54]  morning and it was like crazy tight and now it's totally back to normal um so if you just
[4952.26 --> 4957.22]  wear it for a day or maybe two uh it'll probably get completely back to normal as far as size goes
[4957.94 --> 4962.18]  if you ever have any issue with a product though you should absolutely contact support they don't get
[4962.18 --> 4968.66]  you sorted out uh what else we got jacob love the merch message ideas could you make a water bottle and
[4968.66 --> 4973.22]  shirt with the northern lights design i need it on more ltt merch um it's probably not a bad idea actually
[4973.78 --> 4977.30]  northern lights water bottle we could even just do it as like limited edition or something like
[4977.30 --> 4983.22]  that i don't know if we do it as a shirt i think the shirt could be okay yeah but i don't have see
[4983.22 --> 4990.26]  that's the thing i don't i want us to push forward rather than just find something that works and keep
[4990.26 --> 4996.74]  doing it and so that's one of the things that i think actually makes life more interesting for our
[4996.74 --> 5002.50]  designers i don't want their job to be to just find something that we know people like and keep
[5002.50 --> 5009.14]  recycling it and so it means we make more mistakes but i think it means that um we're doing things that
[5009.14 --> 5014.66]  are more fresh as well that's my that's my opinion i think my one argument would be that it doesn't feel
[5015.30 --> 5020.42]  i guess it is sort of recycling but making it available for the first time ever on a wearable product
[5020.42 --> 5025.54]  it doesn't seem like you're milking it too much to think about it yeah i don't know i'll think about
[5025.54 --> 5032.74]  it yeah i'll think about it uh yeah the water bottle is a pretty pretty cool idea um theodore d says
[5032.74 --> 5036.66]  got the mini and couch size cpu pillows in a previous purchase i remember there was talk
[5037.22 --> 5045.06]  of a thread ripper size pillow should i go get it uh yeah sure i can keep going all right yeah
[5046.74 --> 5053.22]  uh for joseph e the fold three uh check out the video on the oppo find n on short circuit um i i
[5053.22 --> 5056.42]  talked about a lot of my thoughts i'm not going to do the follow-up full review on the fold three
[5056.42 --> 5061.14]  because i talked really about my main thoughts in that video uh there's some in here that linus should
[5061.14 --> 5065.78]  probably address so i'll skip those we'll come back to those uh one of them from christopher r
[5065.78 --> 5070.42]  how is linux working for luke now for work funny story uh
[5073.06 --> 5078.02]  well this is laughing because i was i was venting to him uh only linus and the floatplane guys know
[5078.02 --> 5083.70]  this story because uh the full plane guys are very very uh in tune with it because i was huffing and
[5083.70 --> 5088.42]  puffing about this earlier this week but um so i don't think i actually necessarily told people what
[5088.42 --> 5093.38]  distro i've been using on my laptop i just told people i was running linux on my laptop and uh the
[5093.38 --> 5102.26]  distro that i was running was ubuntu i liked it for the most part but um it felt a little laggy
[5102.26 --> 5108.18]  certain things felt like they took a while to load to be fair that laptop is a little jank and getting
[5108.18 --> 5114.18]  a little old so it might not have been ubuntu's fault to be very clear um but i had mint on a flash
[5114.18 --> 5118.82]  drive and i had been thinking for a while like you know i wanted to try out ubuntu because a lot of
[5118.82 --> 5123.70]  people recommended it and i know like mint is based on it they're very highly related etc but
[5124.34 --> 5128.10]  a lot of the differences i'm not necessarily that into i wanted to definitely give gnome 3 a chance
[5128.10 --> 5132.58]  all that kind of stuff but ultimately i'm not really that into it i liked what i already had
[5133.22 --> 5137.94]  um no offense to ubuntu or gnome 3 or anything like that i just liked the familiarity of what i had
[5137.94 --> 5142.18]  already been working with um so i'd already been thinking about going to mint then i came into work
[5142.18 --> 5146.10]  and i've been having this shoulder problem that's been really bad i've been going to physio for it i was
[5146.10 --> 5152.82]  playing badminton every week and then uh i lost a lot of my range of motion i i can like barely even
[5152.82 --> 5158.74]  reach behind my back um i tried to prove to linus and yvonne that it was getting better when i was at
[5158.74 --> 5163.46]  their place one night reached behind my back back and we all heard my my shoulder sound like it went
[5163.46 --> 5170.98]  through a cement mixer just crunch and i was like well there goes a lot of progress so um the shoulder
[5170.98 --> 5175.54]  tightness and muscle pain and whatnot has been spreading to kind of like my neck and my upper back a
[5175.54 --> 5182.82]  little bit as well um i come into work and my monitor that normally when i sit down in office
[5182.82 --> 5186.90]  i have my laptop and the screen is really low and usually down there it's just like the music whatever
[5186.90 --> 5192.10]  i'm listening to and then i have a monitor above and that's where i actually do all my work um but
[5192.82 --> 5197.30]  it wasn't working for some reason i tried a few steps to diagnose it but like i got stuff to do i
[5197.30 --> 5202.50]  can't sit here and diagnose my laptop all day so i'm i'm working down like this and my neck really
[5202.50 --> 5205.62]  starts to hurt so i'm like whatever i have mint here anyways i've been thinking about it's only
[5205.62 --> 5210.74]  going to take like five ten minutes to get it set up whatever i install that and it works the external
[5210.74 --> 5215.14]  monitor works great things are good i'm working along doing whatever while it's updating in the
[5215.14 --> 5221.78]  background and then just suddenly boop gone i don't know what update did it it was not the graphics
[5221.78 --> 5227.54]  driver i know that much so i i have no idea what what kicked it off again but again i'm sitting here
[5227.54 --> 5231.86]  stuck looking down at just my little laptop screen which is not a good work experience especially when i'm
[5231.86 --> 5240.34]  having these muscle problems so then i installed windows can i just jump in and say that when i
[5240.34 --> 5246.58]  laughed it wasn't because i'm some kind of like microsoft uh simp or something like that i i i am
[5246.58 --> 5254.66]  absolutely well aware that they are they're very they're flawed they have flaws i mean i've spent i a
[5254.66 --> 5260.18]  fair bit of my time being very frustrated with microsoft over the halo crashes that i've been experiencing
[5260.18 --> 5267.14]  yeah it's a lot better now that i disabled the hd texture pack nice um it's still not perfect no and
[5267.14 --> 5273.62]  it's and it's not actually okay so i should say i haven't crashed since then but the experience of
[5273.62 --> 5279.14]  gaming is still terrible there was a two-day period where i played probably somewhere between eight and
[5279.14 --> 5285.22]  12 matches i can't remember exactly i think two or three of them were actually 4v4 oh because people
[5285.22 --> 5289.70]  keep leaving because well no because people keep crashing that too well some of it is because people
[5289.70 --> 5296.66]  are chasing the challenges oh that i didn't know so if they jump into like uh say here's an interesting
[5296.66 --> 5303.86]  one you have to grapple shot five people some maps don't have the grapple shot so they'll just drop so
[5303.86 --> 5311.94]  they'll just leave brutal so anyways i installed windows and yes okay i didn't even realize that yeah i mean
[5311.94 --> 5317.46]  to be clear i don't think that's most of it for me because a lot of them would disappear like just
[5317.46 --> 5322.58]  mid-match randomly like we'd be winning and someone would just leave yeah so i'm assuming that's probably
[5322.58 --> 5326.82]  a crash like we were i think a lot of people don't know that the texture pack like makes you crash like
[5326.82 --> 5333.70]  we were crushing an oddball match 4v4 and then ended up losing 3v4 yeah that sucks like having almost
[5333.70 --> 5338.26]  won it we were at like 90 points or whatever i forget what it's up to i think it's up to 100. it's up to 100.
[5338.26 --> 5343.62]  yeah and then it was like 90 to 20. that hurts and then it just completely turned out i was like
[5343.62 --> 5349.06]  what is going on why is this one of them's gone and that's a very like acidic way to lose it just
[5349.06 --> 5356.10]  sucks yeah it's such a terrible gaming experience yeah so i'm just laughing because i just think it's
[5356.10 --> 5361.62]  funny that everything is trash and and and what really sucks like is like yes i got the monitor
[5361.62 --> 5366.74]  working and i was able to work for the rest of the day also like i said it took five or ten minutes to
[5366.74 --> 5372.18]  get going on mint it took a long time to get going on windows it takes five or ten minutes to get
[5372.18 --> 5377.22]  through the like just the setup wizard at this point in microsoft and uh and windows oh and there
[5377.22 --> 5383.54]  is there's some like like okay log in get my 2fa hey wait a second we're setting up well then what
[5383.54 --> 5388.90]  were you doing before yes what were you doing when you were installing and why do we have to do all
[5388.90 --> 5393.86]  these these yes or no's before it and you're doing all this stuff why is it that when i'm dropped on the
[5393.86 --> 5402.74]  desktop i still have to install chipset drivers how many companies make cpus at this point you can't
[5402.74 --> 5409.30]  just you do you not have intel's phone number you can't be like hey sup intel could we maybe just
[5410.02 --> 5416.02]  have your driver be part of like it just installs maybe update windows like it just gets the latest
[5416.02 --> 5421.14]  one maybe not some garbage generic ancient one or just maybe never at all how about we just install
[5421.14 --> 5425.22]  it what do you think of that does that sound cool is that cool with you guys like i just i just i
[5425.22 --> 5432.10]  can't fathom it you know and stuff like that that's been you know 20 26 years later or whatever since
[5432.10 --> 5438.34]  windows 95 how are we still right clicking on a yellow exclamation mark in device manager in order
[5438.34 --> 5445.14]  to install a driver for something that should never happen yeah and like so okay especially clarify
[5445.86 --> 5453.70]  it should never happen on an utterly mainstream like and paid for whatever the asus you know 130 140
[5453.70 --> 5461.38]  dollar motherboard with whatever the core i7 of the day is and some nvidia or amd current gpu
[5462.26 --> 5466.26]  you should not need to do that you should not need to pay the operating system device manager i installed
[5466.26 --> 5472.74]  it with legit license just saying yeah and like so installing mint and then windows back to back was an
[5472.74 --> 5478.10]  incredibly frustrating experience because mint has the like first launch experience window that shows
[5478.10 --> 5482.66]  up after you install you can just close it if you want it doesn't matter and it has a bunch of options
[5482.66 --> 5486.74]  you can configure and that's actually really nice because you go through the list and it's a lot of
[5486.74 --> 5491.22]  reasonable things that you would do when you first turn on a computer i want to make sure my graphics
[5491.22 --> 5495.30]  driver is correct i want to update the rest of my drivers i want to configure how my windows look i want
[5495.30 --> 5500.26]  to do these types of things great that'll make sense exercises things like that yeah yeah microsoft how do they not
[5500.26 --> 5503.86]  you know what's funny is they used to have personalization stuff as part of that whole
[5503.86 --> 5510.02]  process yeah they probably realized it was way too long and instead of cutting garbage like telemetry
[5510.02 --> 5514.42]  and just not having it maybe uh they cut all the stuff that you actually care about like i'm pretty
[5514.42 --> 5518.74]  sure vista prompted you for like your color scheme do you want targeted ads or untargeted ads we're gonna
[5518.74 --> 5524.26]  have ads no matter what in your paid operating system like oh my goodness i was so cheese and then
[5524.26 --> 5532.82]  i just and honestly not having the package manager which i've become used to on my laptop made setting
[5532.82 --> 5537.70]  up like slack and teams and all this well teams you have to get anyways whatever um it made setting up
[5537.70 --> 5543.14]  all these other things that i needed take longer 100 so the whole process just took forever and then i'm
[5543.14 --> 5549.06]  just cheese that i'm on windows because honestly at this point the user experience on my laptop on windows is
[5549.06 --> 5555.78]  worse but the screen worked and like i'm sure someone's like well i know that problem you have
[5555.78 --> 5562.58]  to fix it by doing these various things that's cool i really needed to get work done like really badly
[5562.58 --> 5568.98]  and i did a few really quick searches on how to potentially fix it didn't work i didn't have time to
[5568.98 --> 5574.42]  just sit there and diagnose my screen the whole day i had work to do yeah so at a certain point i just
[5574.42 --> 5580.66]  have to do the work i don't know what i need to add this to the labs doc um conrad just posted the xbox
[5580.66 --> 5587.78]  series x uh has ads for companies like mcdonald's on the front page and it reminded me of the amazon tv
[5587.78 --> 5595.62]  that we made a video about recently um where on your home screen of the tv it was like i forget if it was
[5595.62 --> 5603.22]  40 ads or 40 anything you would actually wow or 40 anything you'd actually want either one of those are too
[5603.22 --> 5610.10]  high yeah either either one of them is way too high and i actually would like to have a uh like
[5610.10 --> 5617.62]  a ratio where we we basically say okay like what we actually measure it what percentage of your ui is
[5617.62 --> 5623.86]  ads uh and i think that's something that we could find a pretty a pretty standardized way to test if it's
[5623.86 --> 5632.02]  anything above zero it's bs uh well not necessarily okay so for the amazon tv for example would you consider
[5632.02 --> 5642.26]  it completely outlandish to have uh uh a 10 of like a bottom bar that has an offer for prime video
[5643.94 --> 5651.22]  uh prime video you just bought an amazon tv do you maybe want prime video yep probably yeah or like on
[5651.22 --> 5655.14]  your apple tv if they're like hey do you want apple tv plus or whatever they call it or apple gaming
[5655.14 --> 5661.30]  subscription i i i'm okay with the mcdonald's ad is the one that i'm it's it's first party ads are
[5661.30 --> 5669.78]  different i think than third party ads if if xbox is advertising some game or xbox live or whatever
[5669.78 --> 5675.54]  else should it be 40 of your screen though because amazon had gigantic first party ads oh they're all
[5675.54 --> 5680.98]  first party i don't know i mean that makes sense they sell too much stuff but um yeah third party ads
[5680.98 --> 5687.46]  definitely bother me more i would say need to create a system for measuring how pervasive ads are
[5687.46 --> 5696.34]  in a product um like on a tv frequency might be something as well yeah that would be harder to
[5696.34 --> 5700.42]  measure it would be you're not just sitting there using it you're not going to know how often crap is
[5700.42 --> 5706.90]  going to something very difficult to do objectively yeah any plans for an ltt travel mug at some point
[5706.90 --> 5714.10]  yeah we just haven't found we just haven't found the right thing um so far if i made a design for a
[5714.10 --> 5722.90]  merch idea would you care to see it so really complicated yes uh because you know ip is like
[5722.90 --> 5731.30]  complicated and um okay here's a hypothetical hypothetical scenario what if i looked at it and
[5731.30 --> 5736.90]  what if it was super similar to something that we happened to be having the pipeline right now now
[5736.90 --> 5743.06]  i'm in a situation where oh crap either i need to go buy it from you or something or license it from
[5743.06 --> 5750.26]  you even though we came up with it ourselves or i need to alter our design enough that you're not going
[5750.26 --> 5754.66]  to come back to me and complain when our design is super similar to the one that you showed me and that
[5754.66 --> 5762.82]  i didn't use this is the reason why most tv shows just outright refuse to look at fan submitted scripts
[5762.82 --> 5768.02]  for example yeah because if they never look at it and they never allow you to send it to them then they
[5768.02 --> 5772.82]  can never be accused of copying it and there is actually a lot of times throughout history and it's
[5772.82 --> 5780.66]  it's interesting to go back to like way pre-internet pre-phone etc and find things that were invented in like
[5780.66 --> 5786.34]  very different places at times that it would not have been possible for the information to cross that
[5786.34 --> 5791.54]  distance in time like algebra yeah well i didn't know that one in particular but like like these
[5791.54 --> 5797.94]  types of concepts are often invented or thought of by different people at a very similar time frame
[5797.94 --> 5803.94]  um while they're actually both being technically their own original sorry calculus calculus okay
[5803.94 --> 5811.38]  uh i think i think it was calculus uh yeah okay uh in the 1600s isaac newton and gottfried lebnitz
[5811.38 --> 5815.86]  right discover calculus sorry yeah yeah i misspoke yeah and there's a lot of different
[5816.82 --> 5821.54]  versions of that obviously it's not the most common thing in the world but like it's definitely
[5821.54 --> 5824.82]  something that has happened it's common enough there's a word for it i can't remember what it is
[5824.82 --> 5830.42]  conversion evolution is that it someone posted in oh yeah sure okay yeah true scott posted in in
[5830.42 --> 5836.58]  flow plane chat i'm gonna go with that um but yeah so so we don't want to risk don't want to risk
[5836.58 --> 5842.58]  that yep uh donald i've watched ltt since around the time you moved from the old office i've learned
[5842.58 --> 5845.46]  so much you and your team are all awesome i hope you have an amazing holiday weekend oh yeah this is
[5845.46 --> 5849.70]  one that i probably would have just clicked show oh wait i clicked show it no it did not work so have
[5849.70 --> 5855.70]  you gone through and have you done a round if it's curated yet if it's sorry if it's curated already i
[5855.70 --> 5861.70]  think the show thing doesn't work no these are these are all incoming for me what i have nothing
[5861.70 --> 5868.02]  sitting and coming for me oh right so i'm supposed to be looking at curated leopoldo something's any
[5868.02 --> 5874.98]  ltx updates we are we want to do an ltx update or we want to do ltx in 2022 we're really hoping to do
[5874.98 --> 5880.66]  ltx in 2022 but um no guarantees can you scroll all the way up i can
[5885.78 --> 5892.74]  are you troubleshooting yeah something's mine's missing mine mine has lower order count than yours
[5893.30 --> 5901.38]  oh okay uh well hopefully we are catching everyone sorry it's sort of a new system i'm still working on
[5901.38 --> 5908.82]  that uh any chance we get linus cat tips merch uh yes i definitely want to do a cat teaser so it'll
[5908.82 --> 5915.78]  take time you know like a yeah yeah yeah but like a hyper high quality one the last one you'll ever buy
[5915.78 --> 5923.06]  so what what would go into a high quality uh i don't want to say too much but i realized right
[5923.06 --> 5928.34]  after saying that yeah we're not we're not far enough into it um jacob was working on it and then
[5928.34 --> 5933.94]  he got sidelined for a project that i am not able to disclose for realsies it's still too far out but
[5933.94 --> 5941.54]  man let me tell you magnets man oh yeah magnets have you seen what he's working on uh i've seen it
[5941.54 --> 5947.22]  kind of i'm gonna go like this so you know what i'm talking about yeah okay so you do know what i'm
[5947.22 --> 5952.74]  talking about yeah i have not seen it up close i've seen it like yeah do you know about the like the
[5952.74 --> 5958.90]  really cool part of it though the like the weird shape thing no okay well i'll tell you about it
[5958.90 --> 5964.34]  later but jacob's working on something that's like a million dollar idea instead of a cat teaser right
[5964.34 --> 5969.30]  now so he'll come back to the cat teaser eventually cat user could be a million dollar idea yeah it could
[5969.30 --> 5977.54]  but it won't be yeah yeah yeah you know uh we gotta we gotta we got we got more engineers inbound
[5977.54 --> 5984.90]  we gotta focus on the stuff that's like could be a seven figure project as opposed to yeah because
[5984.90 --> 5992.58]  we got a lot of we got man we had our budgeting meeting uh last night oh yeah and we man i don't
[5992.58 --> 5999.94]  know i don't know man i don't know if i want to hire that many people it's a lot like i would have
[5999.94 --> 6007.14]  never thought it possible for us to even approach 50 on staff let alone getting dangerously close to a
[6007.14 --> 6010.34]  100. we were pretty tired by the end there something that i think would have been interesting
[6010.34 --> 6015.94]  though is to measure head count we i didn't even want to count it but like i think we should
[6016.58 --> 6022.10]  it's oh i mean i know it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of like 80 to 85 if we actually
[6022.10 --> 6026.50]  hired every position we talked about yesterday you're technically a medium business once you pass 100
[6026.50 --> 6035.06]  right i think so i don't even want that i never wanted that yeah that's like that's wild yeah um
[6035.06 --> 6039.78]  if you told me in 2013 we would have even been considering that at this point i would have been
[6039.78 --> 6048.66]  like what in 2013 we were trying to figure out how to survive yeah yeah oh man price p asks can you
[6048.66 --> 6052.98]  resurrect tech showdown it scratches that scrapyard war's itch and seems much more covet friendly
[6052.98 --> 6060.42]  no it didn't it didn't do very well tech showdown performed terribly every time i loved them but i enjoyed
[6060.42 --> 6066.26]  it um hey muppet house thanks um yeah i think marcus is on twitter you should you should let him know
[6066.26 --> 6071.38]  let him know guys never be afraid to like you know go find our staff and tell them hey great job
[6072.50 --> 6077.54]  right like that's one of the reasons that we have credits so that people aren't just like a
[6077.54 --> 6085.54]  nameless faceless robot producing you know videos off a conveyor belt like it i can tell you from
[6085.54 --> 6091.62]  personal experience it will brighten someone's day if you just go out of your way to be like hey and be
[6091.62 --> 6099.46]  specific right be specific say hey that moment at this time stamp if you want to be a real bro you can
[6099.46 --> 6104.18]  actually include a link so that they can click the video and see the thing that you really liked and
[6104.18 --> 6108.10]  they can go watch it and be oh yeah you're talking about that yeah i remember that so include a time
[6108.10 --> 6112.82]  stamp say hey i really like this this is what i liked about it that's how to give positive feedback in
[6112.82 --> 6119.78]  a way that will really lift someone's spirits some tech short on episodes actually did quite well and
[6119.78 --> 6125.54]  then there's others that we honestly put more work into that did really poorly like that one but about
[6125.54 --> 6131.54]  a million 1.1 million 1.3 million about a million is not very good 1.3 million from five years ago
[6131.78 --> 6136.66]  no that ain't getting uh that ain't getting a sequel oh no i don't think so yeah no yeah because the stuff
[6136.66 --> 6141.86]  that really performed well from that period has like three or four million views so that's what we're
[6141.86 --> 6146.66]  kind of looking at so yes it's from a time when we were much smaller but it's also had five years to
[6146.66 --> 6150.74]  for the algorithm to find someone who wants to watch it have you ever watched back the ending of
[6150.74 --> 6157.54]  tech showdown episode two the future no it's hilarious watching you and i like figure out what's
[6157.54 --> 6165.86]  even happening so many people thought we staged it yeah i promise you i give you my personal linus tech
[6165.86 --> 6172.02]  tips guarantee of honesty that we did not stage it that was one of those convergent idea things we
[6172.02 --> 6177.54]  both independently came up with exactly the same idea for our machines yeah and we're not gonna tell
[6177.54 --> 6182.42]  you what it is go watch it yourself yeah go watch it pump up those views the future the future yeah
[6183.06 --> 6189.54]  okay uh metal gap he says so i wore my swag a few times feels great top job at linus luke and everyone
[6189.54 --> 6193.70]  involved with it okay luke had nothing to do with it nope and i had barely anything to do with it hey i
[6193.70 --> 6199.14]  wore it once you need to go find you need to go find you need to go find nick on twitter so that he
[6199.14 --> 6205.94]  can share that with the team um so uh yeah that's what you want okay now ryzen pillow yes i'm working
[6205.94 --> 6213.78]  on it oh first i want to show you guys something else though okay hold on hold on no no no no okay so luke
[6214.66 --> 6218.82]  this isn't the thread ripper one but feel this pillow tell me if you notice anything about it
[6218.82 --> 6223.70]  i don't know what i'm supposed to notice i'm not very good at this just tell me about it what is it
[6224.66 --> 6230.50]  um am i supposed to show that side yeah you can show any side you want what i feel yeah just tell
[6230.50 --> 6236.98]  me just tell me tell me tell me about the pillow it feels nice it's a hundred percent alpaca wool is
[6236.98 --> 6242.02]  it really because i was going to say i can feel like you can tell it's not just something random so
[6242.02 --> 6247.46]  for cost purposes i didn't want to make that claim for cost reasons uh the normal ones are a blend
[6248.02 --> 6254.58]  because alpaca wool is super expensive it costs way more than the like normal cheapo fill
[6256.02 --> 6259.38]  this might this might come across the wrong way so i didn't want to say it at first but i'm going to
[6259.38 --> 6264.66]  say it anyways it's like almost sort of lumpy yeah because it's real it's it's well it's because
[6264.66 --> 6269.62]  yeah it's a natural fiber yeah but it's like and it will work itself yeah it's a kind of oh it's great
[6269.62 --> 6274.58]  it's a kind of like it's almost like a mush like it's almost like a like a stress ball like it's
[6275.38 --> 6280.58]  this is why this is where the obsession came from because we got a sample from the factory of the
[6280.58 --> 6286.50]  original cpu pillow that was all alpaca wool we got samples of all different fills and i was like omg
[6287.30 --> 6293.62]  i love this it's really nice i don't want lumpy to come across negative it feels really nice costing made
[6293.62 --> 6298.90]  no sense so you're doing like a premium run or something but then the pillow has been really
[6298.90 --> 6306.18]  successful for us and i was like you know what maybe we could do a super low volume this is going
[6306.18 --> 6311.86]  to be the extreme edition nice yeah i don't know what the pricing is yet don't be surprised if it's
[6311.86 --> 6316.98]  like three or four hundred dollars if you don't buy extreme editions then don't even worry about this
[6316.98 --> 6324.34]  pillow yeah pretty much um so it's all it's in like a black it's are like a dark gray on black
[6324.34 --> 6332.98]  color scheme uh with the gold pins it's like it's like the stupidest stupidest flex ever i really like
[6333.54 --> 6337.86]  i don't know maybe the other ones had this and i just didn't notice but it has the like little oh yeah
[6337.86 --> 6342.58]  they have it they have it a little the little triangle for installation yeah so that's the extreme
[6342.58 --> 6348.10]  edition it's i i know it's like the dumbest thing ever but i yeah i like it
[6348.10 --> 6363.46]  this is the thread ripper so it's here chungus it's it's chunky it's coming i believe these are uh
[6363.46 --> 6368.66]  nick gave me a status update a little while ago i think they're in the port but we're having all
[6368.66 --> 6373.62]  kinds of issues with our port right now here in vancouver they're just they're just dumping entire
[6373.62 --> 6380.34]  containers like into storage like we'll deal with it later so getting christmas presents in time has
[6380.34 --> 6387.22]  been difficult yeah uh good good luck everybody metal gap he says i'm gonna be dumb as balls and
[6387.22 --> 6395.06]  buy two i would actually strongly not recommend it it's it's one of those things that only exists
[6395.06 --> 6400.66]  so you can be like wow i've got an extreme edition pillow you do not need two of them because it's not
[6400.66 --> 6404.90]  even for like these pillows are not for like sleeping on they're not bed you don't need to
[6404.90 --> 6409.86]  fill your skull trail couch yeah yeah totally not necessary so this is a blend this is yeah and it
[6409.86 --> 6415.38]  still feels really good that was why we settled on the blend right but it's not like that yeah it's
[6415.38 --> 6422.34]  just different you can tell it's it's not it's not as good sorry i keep moving away um uh et on the
[6422.34 --> 6428.90]  extreme edition i think it's coming around the same time as the thread ripper pillow and i think the
[6428.90 --> 6432.26]  thread ripper pillow is going to be a couple different sizes if the thread ripper pillow is
[6432.26 --> 6436.98]  a different size than that please disregard the one that we held up we had samples of like six
[6436.98 --> 6441.46]  different sizes or something like that that was just the first one that i found so check go by the
[6441.46 --> 6446.82]  measurements on the site and you can see you can see the design yeah yeah exactly oh google play
[6446.82 --> 6451.54]  google play google play google play what google play got to talk about google play because last time
[6451.54 --> 6456.26]  on the show i only talked about in the pre-show and i slammed apple for the stupid junk that they did with
[6456.26 --> 6461.38]  our app yeah and on the weekend which i've never witnessed from apple before maybe it's a thing
[6461.38 --> 6466.90]  and it just hasn't happened with us i don't know but they they just silently released our app after i
[6466.90 --> 6471.22]  complained about it on a wanshow that's pretty funny i don't know if they saw it or not developer but i
[6471.22 --> 6480.18]  think they did i don't know i just i got a feeling um because they're yeah anyways um google has been
[6480.18 --> 6488.74]  throwing us for an absolute loop super frustrating they have never needed to do a manual uh they like
[6488.74 --> 6494.18]  i think they do like an automated review just to make sure it's not like obviously malware yeah
[6494.18 --> 6497.30]  i think i'm pretty sure they do that i haven't really dove into it because i don't care because
[6497.30 --> 6502.02]  they're not releasing malware so it doesn't matter yeah but um they've never done like a hey we need
[6502.02 --> 6507.94]  to log in and look at your app directly thing before yep and then we pushed an unfortunately quite
[6507.94 --> 6514.26]  buggy version of the app um people have been pointing out when the app is fully closed like
[6514.26 --> 6518.50]  fully closed it's not running the background or anything and you get a notification it will crash
[6519.22 --> 6525.06]  um if you want to use it this way if you get that if it if it crashes there's a new release
[6526.10 --> 6532.02]  because it's a notification every time um it's it's a weird use case we should have tested for it
[6532.02 --> 6539.86]  uh we actually do test for the app not being open but we haven't tested with it like forcibly closed
[6539.86 --> 6545.30]  i see and it's only when it's forcibly closed anyways um so basically it's the people who have
[6545.30 --> 6550.82]  like memory management yeah like software that's like actually forced like completely shutting or
[6550.82 --> 6555.22]  they're just like really careful about making sure they close things all the time and am i am i crazy or
[6555.22 --> 6561.94]  is that just completely unnecessary on modern android i didn't know it was a problem because i
[6561.94 --> 6568.34]  don't close it because i thought it just frees up the memory and then it's like restores it unsuspends
[6568.34 --> 6572.90]  it am i totally missing something here it's just not an issue for me it might be a habit for other
[6572.90 --> 6579.46]  people other stuff i don't know what's going on but people had the problem sure jaden fixed it
[6579.46 --> 6584.34]  really quick right we push an update to the store because we're like oh man this is actually like really bad
[6584.34 --> 6591.94]  for people that have this use case which there clearly are people that do um and and google goes
[6591.94 --> 6596.42]  nope you can't publish this we need to review the app you need to give us login information
[6597.14 --> 6603.94]  for a bug fix and like i told them pretty much right away i honestly didn't know to check because
[6603.94 --> 6607.78]  they've never stopped an app from going out before so i just launched it and i'm like oh yeah it'll show
[6607.78 --> 6612.26]  up in the play store in a couple days and we'll have a couple days of bad tickets and we'll we'll just
[6612.26 --> 6616.26]  address that the fix is literally published already and it'll be here any minute and it's
[6616.26 --> 6621.94]  gonna be fine and then i realized later that they had they had sent a message in saying like nope we
[6621.94 --> 6627.22]  need to review this we give them the correct login information so that they can log in then they
[6627.22 --> 6634.66]  mistype it floatplanet.com floatplanet.com is not the email that i gave them to log in with it's
[6634.66 --> 6641.62]  floatplane.com on the login form on the app there's in big block letters right above the login form
[6641.62 --> 6648.74]  floatplane not float planet also why wouldn't you copy paste yeah there's no way these guys have to
[6648.74 --> 6653.70]  manually type in all imagine the passwords that some people are generating these hundred character long
[6653.70 --> 6660.66]  passwords yeah for sure why are you not so unreasonable why are you not control c control v-ing it yeah so
[6660.66 --> 6667.46]  we send in an appeal to that and i send in my thing like guys this is a bug fix i don't even you
[6667.46 --> 6672.50]  don't even have to take this one roll it back to the previous version take our updates out just make
[6672.50 --> 6677.94]  it so that it isn't erroring on everyone like yes i would love for them to have the new features that
[6677.94 --> 6683.54]  jaden painstakingly made and are awesome yes but at the bare minimum i don't want the app to crash like
[6684.10 --> 6688.50]  please like at least either take the update that is fixing the bug or roll it back to the one that
[6688.50 --> 6693.62]  wasn't causing this bug like come on let's do let's do this properly and then they take forever to
[6693.62 --> 6698.74]  respond because they're still blaming covid even though it's been a million years now and they should
[6698.74 --> 6702.42]  have figured out processes to make this not be a problem anymore i couldn't help noticing we didn't
[6702.42 --> 6707.86]  miss a video upload yeah in the last two years like you should be able to figure this out by now this is
[6707.86 --> 6713.46]  not a good excuse anymore yeah they so they're like oh it's going to be uh up to two days and then when
[6713.46 --> 6717.14]  you submit the form you immediately get an email being like actually it's not going to be up to two days
[6717.14 --> 6724.98]  it's going to be an unknown amount of time because of covet and then i i i appeal that whatever say
[6724.98 --> 6730.42]  that they typed it in wrong i get a message back from them being like hmm so we've done absolutely
[6730.42 --> 6735.14]  nothing with your ticket because what we're waiting for is correct login information if you could give
[6735.14 --> 6740.42]  us the correct login information that would be great i'm 99 sure this was an automated email thing
[6740.42 --> 6746.10]  to be clear but it's still incredibly infuriating um to have someone be like can you give us the right
[6746.10 --> 6749.70]  thing when the whole problem is that they have the right thing and they just typed it in wrong
[6751.06 --> 6757.94]  so i appeal that they take forever again to respond to the email and then the response this time is oh
[6757.94 --> 6763.46]  great yeah we have accepted your appeal you have to resubmit your app for review
[6763.46 --> 6776.26]  come on dude why why in the year 2021 is it necessary for us to resend the same zeros and ones
[6776.26 --> 6781.38]  and there's really weird stuff too like they're like oh you have to go into this like market availability
[6781.38 --> 6787.14]  section of the page and you need to save it and they're like yeah also if you haven't made any changes
[6787.14 --> 6791.94]  the save button isn't going to be available and they literally say this in their email just put like a
[6791.94 --> 6796.02]  space on the end of your app name and then delete it again so that it registers that there's been a
[6796.02 --> 6804.66]  change and then click save like what like sure i'll go do it but like what is this google and then guess
[6804.66 --> 6811.54]  what the estimated time is for them to finally potentially allow us to apply a bug fix seven days
[6812.34 --> 6818.10]  you think that's actually going to get done over christmas nope so it's going to be even longer
[6818.10 --> 6825.30]  holy cow i'm very sorry all because they fat fingered yeah the domain they were trying to log
[6825.30 --> 6832.34]  into this should have been done a very long time ago even even with the like stupid typo because once
[6832.34 --> 6840.10]  they realize it's a stupid typo that is their fault this should get expedited yeah oh my goodness it's so
[6840.10 --> 6845.06]  frustrating and i'm i'm genuinely very sorry to people that are using the android app and it is crashing
[6845.06 --> 6852.02]  just you know if you don't close it it works or you can use that crash which is this is not great
[6852.02 --> 6858.26]  i understand but you can use that crash as it is every time it is a notification so you can check and
[6858.26 --> 6863.22]  there's probably something new for you to watch code dependent says i had a person leave a one-star
[6863.22 --> 6868.18]  review of my business but it was for the other business leasing the other part of the property
[6868.18 --> 6874.18]  it took me weeks and dozens of messages and finally twitter twitter to get it fixed they kept saying
[6874.18 --> 6878.90]  that it wasn't against their rules it doesn't matter if it's against the rules that's so frustrating
[6878.90 --> 6885.70]  it's just stupid so deal with it that's incredibly frustrating that would drive me nuts yeah that's
[6885.70 --> 6891.62]  rough anyways yeah thanks for the reminder jaden uh that deserved a rant just because mostly to be
[6891.62 --> 6897.46]  honest because i ranted about apple's situation yeah and in the end we need to be fair theirs was a lot
[6897.46 --> 6903.94]  easier to deal with theirs resolved itself magically by me talking on on one show let's see if this one
[6903.94 --> 6908.98]  resolves itself magically by talking about it on wan show that would be any googlers out there um
[6909.86 --> 6913.94]  robert says have you ever considered making the man show available as a podcast after it's aired yes
[6913.94 --> 6918.82]  it's uh usually linked under the video i think i think i think it's on i don't i've never i'm gonna
[6918.82 --> 6924.82]  confess to you i've never installed a podcast app i have never listened to a podcast i don't get it
[6925.46 --> 6930.42]  um i i don't really have opportunities in my life to consume that sort of long-form content
[6930.42 --> 6934.98]  i really appreciate that you all do like hang out with us on friday afternoons or evenings i guess
[6934.98 --> 6942.26]  is really when it starts i appreciate you all but it's just it hasn't really been my jam so i have no
[6942.26 --> 6945.62]  idea what platforms we're on i've never really looked i think the business team deals with it
[6946.50 --> 6953.94]  so if they're doing a bad job you could tweet at colton yeah i guess yeah someone asked uh can we sideload
[6953.94 --> 6960.02]  the update i thought about that um i talked to jaden about that i don't want to we kind of
[6960.02 --> 6966.34]  brainstormed about a little bit i don't want to um cool you might not like the reason the main reason
[6966.34 --> 6971.06]  is if we if we release that that's all fine and you update it and there's there's no more error which
[6971.06 --> 6976.42]  is great and makes me want to do it to a certain degree but that's no longer going to auto update
[6976.42 --> 6985.86]  through the store yeah and and it's it's yeah it's it's just better if google just does their job
[6986.58 --> 6992.34]  yes and we can push the proper version of the app joshua carroll says question for lafreniere
[6992.34 --> 6995.78]  apart from linus paying you less than minimum wage in the beginning that was actually ncix
[6995.78 --> 7003.14]  not his fault um what is the worst professional experience you've had with linus he sits back
[7004.74 --> 7007.38]  um wow i don't know um
[7010.98 --> 7014.26]  there's so many it's hard to narrow it down to just one
[7015.06 --> 7020.82]  there's i mean we've been working together for i genuinely what is 11 years i think it's been a long
[7020.82 --> 7028.50]  time um so there's obviously been ups and downs i think it's been pretty good though there's
[7030.18 --> 7035.46]  there's things that i can complain about but if i was in his shoes i would have done the same thing
[7037.94 --> 7041.54]  and if he didn't do that thing ultimately i think it would have been a mistake
[7042.66 --> 7046.58]  like i rag on you a lot maybe i can i've definitely done stuff wrong you have to come
[7046.58 --> 7051.54]  up with something i know you've done stuff wrong but like i don't know like okay the mountain thing
[7051.54 --> 7056.34]  i rag on you about the mountain thing all the time but if you didn't i'm gonna give you an out here
[7056.34 --> 7060.50]  if you didn't go down the mountain and get that thing signed i would have been so cheese
[7061.30 --> 7068.10]  if we did all that work and it was for nothing so like yeah part of me is like bro what the heck but
[7068.10 --> 7071.86]  then the other part of me is like yeah if you didn't did it i would have been even more upset so
[7071.86 --> 7077.78]  it was just an unfortunate situation so i actually don't remember the exact reason that i went down
[7077.78 --> 7084.98]  with uh what was his name john i think you were trying to catch someone because they were up ahead
[7084.98 --> 7089.70]  of us the guy that i and you realized we needed his signature yes and then i believe by the time you
[7089.70 --> 7096.58]  caught up to him you were way i was way past you yeah yeah uh so luke ended up getting like abandoned
[7096.58 --> 7102.82]  in a storm on the top of a mountain because i was like blitzing down the mountain trying to get the
[7102.82 --> 7109.06]  validation that we needed for our guinness world record while i had altitude sickness which is the
[7109.06 --> 7115.06]  problem so i was i was like having a really rough time i'm walking downhill which uh if you haven't
[7115.06 --> 7119.62]  hiked before it's actually still difficult it's not as easy as it sounds um i don't have trouble with it
[7120.26 --> 7128.50]  so i was like going so altitude sickness is like oxygenation levels and stuff i'm a big dude um i was
[7128.50 --> 7132.74]  huffing and puffing and my oxygen levels were getting low and i was feeling really not good
[7132.74 --> 7138.74]  eventually i get to the tree line yeah and breathe deep and then i'm totally fine i end up like carrying
[7138.74 --> 7143.70]  someone else down half the freaking mountain i was totally okay once i was able to breathe properly
[7143.70 --> 7150.66]  but i was having a big issue getting back to the trees but i ended up being fine i uh my backpack
[7151.30 --> 7157.86]  which is actually right here with me now um it was heavy because we were carrying like a bunch of
[7157.86 --> 7164.18]  unnecessary stuff um so i was like just throwing it because the mountain was pretty steep so i would just
[7164.18 --> 7170.10]  throw it and it would roll and then i would i would stand up and start like a light jog to the point
[7170.10 --> 7176.18]  where i'm like stopping myself from falling yeah and then i'll catch up to my laps or to my to my bag
[7176.18 --> 7180.34]  and like kind of collapse into my bag and lay there for a sec and then pick it up and throw it and do
[7180.34 --> 7187.70]  the same cycle again and that's how i got to the tree line it was rough but there's lightning storms on
[7187.70 --> 7193.14]  that mountain so you can't be up there past a certain time yeah and if you are up there past a certain
[7193.14 --> 7198.10]  time there's the potential that some helicopters can come rescue unit cost taught ten thousand dollars if
[7198.10 --> 7202.42]  i remember correctly something like that not an option yeah especially not for us at that time no
[7203.22 --> 7212.26]  um yeah so so luke got to the bottom and was like enraged i was mad that clip is kind of awesome
[7213.22 --> 7220.50]  i don't think you've ever been that mad at me probably not like even close i don't think it kind
[7220.50 --> 7225.70]  of helped though because i used the anger to carry the dude down the mountain yeah yeah um so
[7225.70 --> 7228.66]  the thing is like
[7232.74 --> 7241.62]  yeah okay i was taken aback when he was extremely angry at the bottom because honestly this is
[7241.62 --> 7246.90]  something i haven't really talked about um that whole thing wasn't a great experience for me either
[7246.90 --> 7252.42]  yeah i thought that the experience i'm not going to name any names but i thought it was supposed to be
[7252.42 --> 7258.98]  more about teamwork and about us all achieving something together and it turned out that not
[7258.98 --> 7267.94]  everyone who participated in that event was handling it that way it turned out that for some people it was
[7268.58 --> 7278.74]  some kind of flex sort of thing for them and it was not their intention for everybody to succeed
[7278.74 --> 7287.62]  and make it to the land party at the top of the mountain and uh what happened was um you know i i
[7287.62 --> 7293.54]  didn't really know anything about mountaineering or whatever that's called i mean really let's say it was
[7293.54 --> 7297.38]  a hike i don't think anyone on the team really high altitude hike why don't we call it that i didn't
[7297.38 --> 7302.58]  really know anything about it i didn't realize just how difficult it was going to be i thought that you know
[7303.30 --> 7310.18]  we were solving a lot of you know the technical challenges and someone else was solving a lot of the
[7310.82 --> 7315.62]  uh like the logistical challenges of getting all the people up the mountain and it wasn't until we
[7315.62 --> 7321.70]  were probably a quarter or a third of the way up that i had a conversation that enlightened me to the
[7321.70 --> 7329.14]  fact that not everyone intended for everybody to make it and i was like excuse me pardon
[7329.14 --> 7340.26]  so the entire rest of my day so i was also sort of quite emotionally uh charged i didn't know this
[7340.26 --> 7346.90]  portion until way later either yeah um i was not informed part way up the mountain yeah so i kept i
[7346.90 --> 7354.58]  kept that to myself uh because from my point of view it was all about doing whatever we could to get to
[7354.58 --> 7358.26]  the top of the mountain like i don't know if you know but i was carrying one of the lead acid batteries
[7358.82 --> 7367.06]  uh whereas yeah certain certain people had clearly optimized their load to increase their chances of
[7367.06 --> 7375.30]  making it to the top um so like i i was i think i took a you carried it the whole way didn't you i did
[7375.30 --> 7380.50]  i think i took a shift with one of them but i did not carry it the whole way um so so i was
[7380.50 --> 7388.58]  what the what that person who didn't intend for everyone to make it um didn't realize was because
[7388.58 --> 7393.78]  we were the ones who talked to guinness was that we needed a certain threshold of people for them to
[7393.78 --> 7400.90]  consider it a land party so because not everybody ultimately did make it we actually had to recruit
[7400.90 --> 7407.54]  other hikers to participate in our land party and now i remember i had to catch up to one of them
[7407.54 --> 7413.14]  because i needed his contact information and he was leaving so that we could get him his certificate
[7413.14 --> 7419.06]  yeah and so that we could actually submit his name yeah okay i remember now it was like really important
[7419.06 --> 7427.14]  so so i was doing everything i could to make it happen i was down way early i was sitting there worried
[7427.14 --> 7432.42]  but i was like in the car i was tired but i was like sitting there worried and luke comes down he's like
[7432.42 --> 7441.14]  like enraged and he's like you know you like abandoned me on this mountain potentially to a
[7441.14 --> 7448.02]  lightning storm i have altitude sickness i'm like dude i had no idea you were just kind of like
[7448.82 --> 7455.46]  going a little slower than me when i went ahead i didn't mean to like leave you on the mountain i
[7455.46 --> 7461.06]  needed to go catch up to that guy because if we don't get all of the signed i like i forget what it
[7461.06 --> 7467.54]  was it was a film release or it was a contact sheet it was a certification that he participated
[7467.54 --> 7472.98]  that's right okay it's coming back it was a legal form it was the legal document that he
[7472.98 --> 7477.94]  participated with his contact information so guinness could verify him someone found the someone found
[7477.94 --> 7484.10]  the timestamp okay let's pull it up thanks barrington full of which someone you mean barrington
[7484.10 --> 7488.26]  barrington yeah yeah i actually didn't read the name thanks barrington okay here it is
[7490.74 --> 7498.42]  okay so this is a highly impressed one luke lafrangiere
[7498.42 --> 7507.62]  sheesh
[7513.70 --> 7514.66]  and let me tell you
[7517.22 --> 7526.18]  when someone's got okay when someone's got a hundred pounds and six inches on you and they look at you with
[7526.18 --> 7532.50]  that face no matter how much you know that you mutually love each other
[7536.58 --> 7537.70]  it was a quiet car ride
[7540.10 --> 7546.90]  i remember that and you can tell like i'm carrying like i sprung back up because i'm carrying someone
[7546.90 --> 7552.34]  else's backpack yeah like i was fine oxygen i was fine by the end and adrenaline
[7552.34 --> 7560.50]  yeah you were clearly getting down that mountain yeah yeah but but it was i was like from reports
[7560.50 --> 7564.98]  from people that were there before i got to the tree line i was like i was losing color in my face
[7564.98 --> 7570.10]  and like i was this was probably mostly after you had left to be fair i don't fully even remember
[7570.10 --> 7576.98]  the time i had no idea why you were mad i was like you're just relaxing in the car and i was so confused
[7576.98 --> 7582.42]  what what what do you want me to do i'm supposed to hike back up the mountain i did the same i did the
[7582.42 --> 7590.98]  same hike as you like yeah what do you want from me i don't even know if i knew i was just frustrated
[7590.98 --> 7596.42]  with the situation because there was also like i don't remember the exact details of this but once we
[7596.42 --> 7602.66]  were in the trees yeah there was lightning yeah it was like legitimately hitting like around us so
[7602.66 --> 7609.30]  i missed all of that i didn't know the storm actually came yeah oh and not to name names but
[7609.30 --> 7614.66]  the dude that i'm carrying down the mountain for a very significant or like their equipment you mean
[7614.66 --> 7620.66]  and him oh i didn't know i have his bag i have my my bag on my backpack his bag on my chest and
[7620.66 --> 7625.78]  i'm shoulder carrying him so i'm not like you know yeah yeah but i'm shoulder carrying him we get
[7625.78 --> 7630.74]  we get really close to the end and then lightning strikes really close by and suddenly everything
[7630.74 --> 7637.94]  is okay again and he's running without his bag in front of me i'm just like what now you're just like
[7637.94 --> 7644.02]  magically okay i just carried you down like legitimately at the very least a quarter i don't
[7644.02 --> 7648.42]  remember exactly the the lengths and stuff but it was like a very large portion of this hike
[7648.42 --> 7661.46]  yeah i was not impressed by uh the magical healing of of nearby lightning yep so we um
[7662.02 --> 7666.10]  and we were we were like the people that were still up there um which i don't know everyone
[7666.10 --> 7671.38]  outside of paul myself and brandon i know it was us and then there was other people i don't yeah
[7671.38 --> 7676.34]  brandon struggled he had a really heavy bag he should not have brought all the stuff that he did
[7676.34 --> 7681.38]  he really shouldn't have i told him not to you did he thought we were going for a walk and i was like
[7682.02 --> 7688.74]  no um but those those everyone that was there was like rationing out their water and stuff because
[7688.74 --> 7693.30]  we were like running out of supplies like it was it was a rough it was a rough situation um
[7694.58 --> 7700.02]  yeah so i won't say who the problem was but i'll say that we've subsequently collabed with everyone who
[7700.02 --> 7712.66]  wasn't a problem you do the math um but yeah like i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't have
[7712.66 --> 7717.70]  any particular examples that i can think of i forget what the original question was oh being mad at me
[7717.70 --> 7723.70]  what no what is the worst professional experience i'd say that was a bad experience yeah but i don't
[7723.70 --> 7730.74]  think that was like okay experience i had but it says with linus does that mean with you in particular
[7730.74 --> 7737.06]  i mean i was sure as heck involved yeah but like i said if you didn't go get the thing signed i would
[7737.06 --> 7746.26]  have been more upset i think i think you guys gotta understand this guy is like is like you get shot
[7746.98 --> 7753.06]  in the head but you get the flag to the capture point like this it's just the kind of character that
[7753.06 --> 7760.90]  this guy is yeah so you know if i'm yeah if i'm gonna make a call between save luke or save the
[7760.90 --> 7766.10]  the the ship you know you save the ship you save the ship you let luke fall overboard it's that simple
[7766.74 --> 7774.74]  and and i'll often figure it out so like it's probably right i don't know but but yeah so like i
[7775.62 --> 7779.30]  it was frustrating in the moment but i also didn't have a lot of various pieces of information
[7779.30 --> 7783.22]  at that time we've definitely had some tense conversations over the years i mean you work
[7783.22 --> 7789.62]  together with someone for long enough it's just gonna happen yeah it happens um i like to think
[7789.62 --> 7796.10]  that all of it was for the best i i don't know i i'm not supposed to i'm not supposed to answer your
[7796.10 --> 7803.14]  question obviously i'm i'm interested though well i mean there was the time we both cried yeah so i'm
[7803.14 --> 7807.30]  sure i don't even fully remember i know parts of that but i don't fully remember everything that was
[7807.30 --> 7811.06]  discussed there but i know parts of it you know it's one of those things that i am certainly not
[7811.06 --> 7818.50]  at liberty to discuss since it was hr related so you know there's a there's a certain like there's
[7818.50 --> 7824.50]  just a a level of professionalism that i i like to maintain you know i'm not gonna yeah like there's
[7824.50 --> 7827.70]  certain stuff i just i'm not gonna talk about yeah like we're not gonna we're just not gonna talk
[7827.70 --> 7832.50]  about that because it's not professional to talk about hr and stuff like we've we've struggled right
[7832.50 --> 7837.78]  like when you're when you're building something for over 10 years um you're gonna especially in
[7837.78 --> 7842.58]  a very scrappy way you're gonna butt heads yeah um you know i'm sure there were times when i set
[7842.58 --> 7846.90]  really unrealistic expectations like in the early days of float plane that were extremely frustrating
[7847.54 --> 7857.94]  there's not just the early days of float plane but i think i am not uh the most uh hmm how do i say this
[7857.94 --> 7863.94]  i'm not the absolute most respecting of authority
[7866.74 --> 7871.46]  so the fact that i'm still here i think and i'm not trying to toot your horn but i think we've done
[7871.46 --> 7877.30]  pretty good i think we've done pretty well i think we've made it work yeah every relationship is work
[7877.30 --> 7884.74]  yeah okay employee employer boyfriend girlfriend if it's not you should maybe look into potential lies
[7884.74 --> 7887.54]  or something yeah maybe do you actually even have that close of a relationship yeah
[7888.74 --> 7892.82]  i'm not yet like i'm not judging or anything i'm just it might be time for some reflection do you
[7892.82 --> 7900.34]  actually share with each other right like do you can you lift linus yes oh 100 not even not even a
[7900.34 --> 7904.34]  challenge done it a few times on channel super front i think yeah weren't you both basically kids at the
[7904.34 --> 7911.14]  beginning of ltt anyways i mean i feel that way now i i didn't know what i was doing you're are you three
[7911.14 --> 7916.34]  older than me uh i don't remember exactly no i think i'm like four four or five years older than
[7916.34 --> 7924.34]  you i'm 35 i'm 31 at four then yeah okay yeah yeah yep so i i would kind of argue that i more or less
[7924.34 --> 7929.78]  still was not legally but like oh yeah no you were like you were you were baby luke you look back even
[7929.78 --> 7937.38]  at like the man show back then literally baby yeah yeah i still have scars see how my oh from the uh from
[7937.38 --> 7948.02]  the arm yeah yeah yeah that was uh it's like man i you were kind of a disaster like when i met you
[7948.82 --> 7954.02]  yeah and like to be clear i'm not gonna blame someone for getting hit by a car right like
[7957.14 --> 7960.98]  that was a mess but just stuff seemed to happen to you a lot
[7960.98 --> 7968.66]  yeah you know you know how some people stuff just seems to happen to them a lot like i've kind of
[7968.66 --> 7973.54]  always sort of felt that way it's been kind of frustrating but it seems to be happening less now
[7973.54 --> 7978.74]  yeah yeah i feel like things have been pretty stable for you right yeah okay cool the only like
[7978.74 --> 7982.98]  problematic thing and i i think in like probably at least a couple of years has just been my shoulder
[7982.98 --> 7988.18]  well family is always a problem yeah but i i'm saying i'm talking generally like i've got a i've got a
[7988.18 --> 7994.10]  family member that's like anti-vax and i really wish that uh dr bonnie henry had sent out the little
[7994.10 --> 8001.70]  memo about how the provincial restrictions are for this holiday that no unvaccinated individuals are
[8001.70 --> 8008.42]  supposed to attend a family gathering like just don't because that's you're causing problems can you
[8008.42 --> 8015.14]  please stop yeah um especially because omicron spreads so easily um anyway so dr henry sent that out i
[8015.14 --> 8020.10]  think today or yesterday or something like that and i had already drawn that line for myself i was
[8020.10 --> 8023.70]  like look no i'm just not going to entertain this anymore you need to stop you need to just actually
[8023.70 --> 8031.94]  get your shot like be a man um and by man i don't mean a toxic masculinity man i mean like stand up to
[8031.94 --> 8036.02]  responsibility this is that this is not about you yeah i know you're young and healthy and you're
[8036.02 --> 8043.06]  probably going to be fine ain't the point dude um so so you know my my my response to this is be a man
[8043.06 --> 8047.54]  get your jab no you're not coming to christmas dinner unless you get your get your together um
[8048.66 --> 8053.14]  and it would have really saved me the trouble if dr henry would have sent this earlier because i had
[8053.14 --> 8056.82]  to make the call whether we were because we're hosting christmas dinner this year yeah we're the
[8056.82 --> 8062.98]  only ones in our family now with a big enough house now that my parents downsized so like i didn't
[8062.98 --> 8068.02]  want to make this call i didn't want to be involved in any of this but my hand is sort of forced here
[8068.02 --> 8077.22]  because we had to finalize who's coming yeah and i just i was so frustrated that i that i had to have
[8077.22 --> 8085.38]  such a that i have to have these just stupid conversations right um and i was just like no
[8085.38 --> 8092.26]  forget it i'm actually just not going to entertain this anymore be a man do the right thing yes that's
[8092.26 --> 8095.70]  a no that's a is russell peters cancelled are you allowed to reference russell peters i genuinely have
[8095.70 --> 8103.70]  no idea i don't follow that stuff um so yeah thanks dr henry for two you know probably probably
[8103.70 --> 8109.22]  the right call but a little late lachlan new hoodie heck yeah any info on when the swack it will be back
[8109.22 --> 8118.02]  in stock uh when we can when we can man we're trying um chrissy every jacket i wear in the winter's
[8118.02 --> 8125.14]  now from ltt thanks i have more holes than socks i'm gonna need at least 20 pair socks when we are working
[8125.14 --> 8131.86]  on it okay i can't get the stretch right they're too stretchy so they're kind of hard to pull on okay
[8131.86 --> 8137.78]  i don't like that yeah and the other issue i have with socks that are too stretchy is when you move
[8137.78 --> 8142.66]  around they have a tendency to rotate on your foot that's my biggest and i don't like it yeah so i need
[8142.66 --> 8149.06]  to get the stretch right we're gonna do some kind of merino wool blend because i just love the properties
[8149.06 --> 8153.86]  merino wool it's like it's freaking amazing it's warm it's breathable it's awesome feels great really
[8153.86 --> 8158.18]  comfortable but what we have to do is we have to get the weave right and we have to get whatever type
[8158.18 --> 8163.14]  of stretch material that we have woven into it we have to get that perfect there's also like if you're
[8163.14 --> 8171.22]  if you're playing a sport and your foot can slide inside the sock sucks really bad it really sucks really
[8171.22 --> 8181.54]  not so no promises um in fact this jacket with the 3d printed like uh like uh insulation material
[8181.54 --> 8186.58]  is probably going to beat it to the punch but uh speaking of you said all your jackets are uh
[8187.46 --> 8192.90]  ltt's hey you want another one yeah this one's like it's really great i use the i use my stealth hoodie
[8192.90 --> 8196.10]  as an inner layer because it's not it's not like a winter jacket yeah but i use my stealth
[8196.10 --> 8200.02]  hoodie as an earlier throw that on over top it's like kind of solves that problem awesome yeah
[8200.02 --> 8204.10]  um what phone screen protectors are good are they worth it today with gorilla glass on phones today
[8204.10 --> 8209.94]  just as long as you get a gorilla glass phone like screen protector then you should be good to go
[8209.94 --> 8214.98]  most of them are pretty good about touch responsiveness so that's that's what i would do
[8214.98 --> 8219.62]  i think doesn't dbrand have them i would i would probably just i'd probably just go for dbrand because
[8219.62 --> 8224.10]  at least if like it sucks you can complain and they will deal with it yeah they'll insult you but
[8224.10 --> 8229.86]  they'll deal with it uh brock says uh comparing video compression 4k movie on youtube versus
[8229.86 --> 8238.26]  netflix versus apple versus amazon versus blu-ray 1080 versus blu-ray 4k that's a pretty cool idea yeah
[8238.26 --> 8242.82]  i thought that could actually be pretty interesting i thought that's actually a pretty cool idea yeah um
[8243.46 --> 8251.86]  okay yeah i like it it's a little there's gonna be problems but it's definitely interesting to look at
[8251.86 --> 8258.90]  i know there are people who can rip 4k from these services it shouldn't be too much of a problem for
[8258.90 --> 8265.54]  youtube what we could probably do is we have an account that's in good enough standing that we
[8265.54 --> 8270.10]  could probably just upload a freaking movie and it would be there for at least a little bit
[8271.46 --> 8276.26]  so as long as we can pull the encode back down and store it locally then i think we'd be able to
[8276.26 --> 8283.14]  evaluate their encoding quality on it interesting um yeah i think it could be done comparing all
[8283.14 --> 8289.30]  encoding on video services that's a really cool idea and there's all kinds of tools that you can use to
[8289.30 --> 8295.30]  compare the encode quality um that that would be a bit of a black black hole it'd be a bit of a rabbit
[8295.30 --> 8299.06]  hole but it'd be a really really cool concept it's probably kind of the thing that'll take us some time
[8299.06 --> 8306.90]  bet yeah um luke says first off thanks to you and the team for being an inspiration will you guys
[8306.90 --> 8315.38]  ever look into digital forensics i probably not i think there's some potentially cool things something
[8315.38 --> 8320.42]  that i would love to see is if you put like two different files on two different new hard drives
[8321.22 --> 8326.34]  and built a clean room and did a platter swap and then tried to see if you could access both of them
[8326.34 --> 8330.50]  yeah it's one of those things that is just what value does it add right because it's the kind of
[8330.50 --> 8335.14]  thing that i would never recommend anyone do anyway i would just like to see it yeah you should just
[8335.14 --> 8338.98]  have a professional do that kind of work if the data matters to you at all and if the data doesn't
[8338.98 --> 8344.58]  matter to you then you probably just shouldn't do it like those are really i i know that that it's not
[8344.58 --> 8350.10]  what people want to hear but if you can't like if it's not if it's not worth paying a professional
[8350.10 --> 8357.62]  then it's then you shouldn't do it i don't know why not i mean if you have i guess if you have
[8357.62 --> 8362.10]  nothing to lose professionals in these situations like if it's and i'm not naming any names as far
[8362.10 --> 8365.94]  as professionals i don't want to get involved in the whole drama show that is the data recovery
[8365.94 --> 8372.34]  industry absolutely yeah but regardless it's not cheap right um the cost of one hard drive
[8373.30 --> 8378.90]  is quite digestible and for someone who's already a hobbyist in the space if they're like yeah i could
[8378.90 --> 8384.26]  lose that stuff it's not the end of the world but i would like to retain it it might be worth the cost
[8384.26 --> 8389.78]  of a hard drive to give it a shot could be interesting i don't know no no reason actually
[8389.78 --> 8394.42]  do i don't feel i just want to respond to sir francis 14 real quick here listen talking about valid
[8394.42 --> 8399.46]  reasons to not get a vaccine uh you know when you're going through chemo or immunocompromised i
[8399.46 --> 8403.38]  know for a fact this is my family member i know for a fact that ain't the reason yeah linus is talking
[8403.38 --> 8411.22]  to a specific person yep yeah uh and it's for those people that people like my relative need
[8411.22 --> 8418.90]  to get a shot yeah yeah uh all right say breeze uh huge fan finally got around to buying the desk
[8418.90 --> 8422.02]  pad hey this one probably shouldn't have made it into period i'm in the wrong thing
[8422.82 --> 8428.66]  darn it trevor i can get a fold three for only 300 to 400 dollars after trading in a three-year-old
[8428.66 --> 8437.78]  iphone 10s worth it um yes yeah is that a question the rain reason why i curated that because i curated
[8437.78 --> 8443.46]  that one was i just really wanted to make sure that he did it it's like wait why are you even asking
[8443.46 --> 8451.14]  just go uh jr6955 says i have a hard drive with five bitcoin and i don't trust data recovery then just
[8451.14 --> 8458.50]  fly there literally fly there and stand over them while they recover it that was easy like it's literally
[8458.50 --> 8470.02]  worth 200 grand so it's probably worth a plane ticket yeah i'm happy to help yeah um okay jacob i'm a
[8470.02 --> 8474.42]  current best buy employee of a year or so oh i thought you were saying employee of the year employee
[8474.42 --> 8479.06]  of a year or so in sales and inventory i was wondering if you guys wanted to chat or ask questions
[8479.06 --> 8484.02]  about different stuff literally anything on or off the record um i don't know yeah maybe i don't really
[8484.02 --> 8488.02]  have any questions for best buy at the moment i would have to it would have to be prompted by
[8488.02 --> 8493.62]  something like i gotta confess best buy doesn't get a lot of my brain cycles on a given day well this is
[8493.62 --> 8498.82]  a like one-ish year sales employee so you're not going to get a lot of like operational answers
[8498.82 --> 8504.10]  but if it was like how is working in tech during a chip shortage or something working in tech retail
[8504.10 --> 8508.26]  during a chip shortage or something maybe i don't know oh sir francis wants to clarify they were
[8508.26 --> 8515.86]  saying the same thing as me okay yeah 100 okay yep thanks sir francis we're chill uh in your recent
[8515.86 --> 8519.94]  review of the louis vuitton earbuds at the beginning you showed the abyss 1266 headphones how did you have
[8519.94 --> 8525.86]  these on hand you still have the one from the dms collaboration maybe i mean they're they sound so
[8525.86 --> 8531.30]  good they're one of those things that we uh it's not like i would daily drive them they're super
[8531.30 --> 8537.38]  uncomfortable but when the lab is a thing having something like that for reference is going to be
[8537.38 --> 8543.86]  extremely useful yep um bryce says things aren't looking so hot down here as a software engineer
[8543.86 --> 8548.82]  how difficult is it to get canadian citizenship uh it's challenging but it's doable definitely possible
[8548.82 --> 8555.38]  especially if you have good credentials that that helps a lot education is pretty big software engineer
[8555.38 --> 8561.78]  uh you should be in a relatively good shape yeah don't expect that like canada is going to be maybe
[8561.78 --> 8567.70]  as different as you guys might think it is yep we are america's hat and we kind of own it um
[8568.50 --> 8572.18]  matthew the few land parties i've been to were great even though i suck at first person shooters
[8572.18 --> 8576.10]  which was most of what we played plus i always enjoy a well-planned event yeah man how much fun would
[8576.10 --> 8580.42]  it be to just run like a land center i really stopped bothering making videos at that point i really
[8580.42 --> 8585.70]  games just included that one to like hype it up yeah all right fair enough uh nick says used to
[8585.70 --> 8589.54]  work at avid cnc super cool to see the machine featured in some of your videos excited to see all
[8589.54 --> 8596.58]  the projects i'm now doing metrology r d and would love to see measurement and inspection features in a
[8596.58 --> 8602.66]  video that's kind of cool that sounds like the kind of thing that we could get into for labs as well
[8602.66 --> 8608.26]  metrology i've never even heard of that before powell says polish customs will hold this for more than it
[8608.26 --> 8613.06]  took to travel here oh for the order also our tax system is very bad wanted you to know love you
[8613.06 --> 8618.58]  guys when hoodie's amazing i'm only dressing ltt now i'd love to see more 3d printing stuff 3d printing
[8618.58 --> 8622.98]  is a tough one we've actually got a 3d printer in now that we're probably going to make a video on
[8622.98 --> 8632.02]  this thing is a tank it prints i think six times faster than our prusas yeah yeah that's got to
[8632.02 --> 8635.62]  actually be a pretty interesting setup it's like a six thousand dollar 3d printer they sent it over
[8635.62 --> 8639.06]  wow they're like yeah do whatever you want with it and so i'm kind of thinking oh i might make a
[8639.06 --> 8645.30]  video about it does it have like honking fans it has honking everything i guess it would have to
[8645.30 --> 8652.74]  the motors are like this big okay yeah that's cool there is a 3d printing nerd yeah yeah there's
[8652.74 --> 8656.18]  always like other channels that are super focused on 3d printing just because we don't cover it a
[8656.18 --> 8662.74]  ton doesn't mean it's not being covered yeah uh josiah first time ordering wondering if you have
[8662.74 --> 8670.18]  plans for making more tools beyond the screwdriver of course but i'm gonna i'm gonna be i'm gonna be
[8670.18 --> 8676.02]  straight with you um we're a little we're a little strapped for cash right now between screwdriver being
[8676.02 --> 8684.90]  delayed when we've already put down a lot of the money for it um which is seven figures like not just
[8684.90 --> 8693.54]  barely seven figures like it's a lot of money um and backpack being a thing that just way exceeded my
[8693.54 --> 8700.26]  expectations like i would have based on what i thought you know gut feeling going into it i might
[8700.26 --> 8703.70]  have brought in like 500 or a thousand units of a backpack i would have done whatever's the minimum
[8703.70 --> 8711.06]  order quantity we're ordering 30 000 units like i am extremely confident that this product is going to
[8711.06 --> 8719.86]  absolutely kill awesome so yeah it's awesome except that um i i don't have any money still sitting there
[8719.86 --> 8727.06]  yeah yeah so so i so i i right now we're not looking to bring on any kind of like major huge projects
[8727.06 --> 8733.14]  we're keeping you know garments going um you know anything that we're ordering you know two thousand
[8733.14 --> 8739.46]  three thousand maybe five thousand of if the order if the if the cost per unit is low enough but i don't
[8739.46 --> 8747.14]  have capital right now to do another like major project um and no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do a
[8747.14 --> 8755.94]  kickstarter i will not pre-sell okay i gotta be careful because life changes things change um but
[8755.94 --> 8763.14]  the way i feel about it right now i do not intend to ever pre-sell anything because i believe that people
[8763.14 --> 8770.82]  should buy something based on what it is not based on what they hope it will be so i've i've gotten
[8771.62 --> 8777.94]  there's been a lot of discussion a lot of times about a lot of different projects about taking pre-orders
[8778.50 --> 8786.82]  and uh one of the things that we had discussed doing it around is um the screwdriver and i pushed back and
[8786.82 --> 8791.70]  pushed back and i said no we're not gonna do it and i'm so glad i did because it's been delayed
[8793.22 --> 8798.50]  like i think compared to what we thought we might be able to hit i think it's been delayed like over
[8798.50 --> 8803.78]  a year now yeah i would not have been happy having someone's money for a year and not having delivered
[8803.78 --> 8807.62]  anything especially if i didn't need to have it and a lot of people in that time would have bought a
[8807.62 --> 8812.10]  different really high-end screwdriver and i'm just creating i'm creating friction in our relationship
[8812.10 --> 8819.38]  right you've given me money i've given you nothing um yeah in case you're wondering jaden i think
[8819.38 --> 8830.18]  that's about 27 40 foot containers of backpacks oh oh oh they don't compress as much as we'd like
[8830.18 --> 8840.58]  even just the logistics of that is crazy oh man yeah oh man ltt store's getting real guys i had a lot
[8840.58 --> 8847.70]  of people questioning whether ltt store would make a significant dent in our like in our hiring costs
[8847.70 --> 8855.22]  our like budgeting costs for the lab you got no idea like ltt store is a huge part of what is going to
[8855.22 --> 8861.22]  make the lab possible and so oh yeah so the lab kind of came about because i was like okay it's time
[8861.22 --> 8871.38]  let's do it um i just looked no there is no update on the hammer and i don't think ltt would make one
[8871.38 --> 8876.42]  so no i don't think so uh wes says what are your thoughts on software companies charging renewals
[8876.42 --> 8883.78]  for maintenance and support um i've done it i've paid them um in certain scenarios i think it's totally
[8883.78 --> 8889.62]  fine it's not really any different than the old way which was creating a new version windows 3.1
[8890.26 --> 8896.82]  and it having a bunch of fixes in it and then you would buy it so to me it's it's essentially like
[8896.82 --> 8902.34]  an update um yeah i think it's kind of the same thing and it's basically what we're doing now with
[8902.34 --> 8907.70]  software as a service except i think software as a service is kind of more toxic um more anti-consumer
[8908.26 --> 8912.10]  because at least if you don't need that particular bug fix the old way you didn't have to buy it
[8912.10 --> 8917.46]  whereas now you're paying no matter what even if they just don't fix anything it's also really
[8917.46 --> 8923.06]  bad for people that want to dabble um like if i want to do i don't know i want to mess around with
[8923.06 --> 8927.62]  this thing every like few months well it'd be nice to just buy the software and know i can jump back
[8927.62 --> 8931.78]  to it no i'm not like a super professional i don't need every update that's going to come to
[8931.78 --> 8936.58]  it forever i'm actually like probably totally fine using this version of it for basically ever
[8937.14 --> 8941.94]  like let me just don't break it yeah yeah yeah exactly like oh man uh gremlin
[8941.94 --> 8946.42]  injector asks lab shares or membership of some kind to fund it i think that we might have some
[8946.42 --> 8952.26]  kind of like professional access maybe there will be more data like maybe you'll get the raw data
[8952.26 --> 8955.78]  instead of just the graphs that we publish or something you know we've had discussions
[8955.78 --> 8960.74]  internally about what that would look like uh i think it would be very optional and really to me
[8960.74 --> 8965.94]  the lab is supposed to serve as a consumer resource not as a necessarily professional resource so i
[8965.94 --> 8971.06]  would want it to be very optional uh oily rain asks a while back you showed a pie chart with a rough
[8971.06 --> 8976.82]  breakdown of ltd income how does that look today extremely complicated it's difficult to calculate
[8976.82 --> 8982.82]  i can tell you right now that for this year even though creator warehouse has sold every item that
[8982.82 --> 8989.70]  has gone out the door at a profit the cash flow for the year is minus multiple millions of dollars
[8989.70 --> 8991.94]  so have i made money
[8996.10 --> 9005.54]  have i uh technically no right i don't know right yeah technically no but i have inventory yeah sitting
[9005.54 --> 9011.14]  in a warehouse you've made what i would argue to be very sound very logical investments investments yes
[9011.14 --> 9019.30]  yeah yeah but i haven't gotten a return on them so i haven't made money but my shopify dashboard says
[9020.50 --> 9024.90]  that it's profitable things are going good that it's going great yeah so that's why that's why physical
[9024.90 --> 9030.10]  goods business business is just complicated right like i i um i don't i don't actually know i mean i
[9030.10 --> 9035.14]  could tell you i could i could break down the revenue but that would be very misrepresentative so for
[9035.14 --> 9040.26]  example something like floatplane might have a very low revenue number but because it's a software product
[9040.26 --> 9045.30]  it's a subscription product and our most ardent supporters are over there giving us this monthly
[9045.30 --> 9051.38]  subscription on floatplane it's it other than the overhead of the floatplane team which does other
[9051.38 --> 9057.78]  stuff it doesn't have a cost i mean there's bandwidth there's which is actually okay that's okay there are
[9057.78 --> 9063.38]  costs that's good yeah yeah but they're compared to physical goods very low they're relatively it's
[9063.38 --> 9069.78]  like shipping it's less significantly less than shipping yeah so it's complicated i guess is what i have
[9069.78 --> 9078.18]  to say about that um it's a potential energy versus kinetic energy thing but for money says cyclone
[9078.18 --> 9082.26]  interesting way of that's an interesting way of describing it yeah uh harry d says oh
[9084.98 --> 9088.50]  i've been watching for over five years i'll be graduating with a degree in computer science next
[9088.50 --> 9091.78]  semester thanks to all i was wondering if there will ever be a channel focused on programming i can
[9091.78 --> 9096.58]  tell you probably not probably no it moves too fast that i and our focus is on evergreen content
[9096.58 --> 9101.86]  we're just not gonna there's really good channels out there too yeah go do that go do that go watch
[9101.86 --> 9109.22]  them yeah yeah dagan 5800x or 5600x thinking about upgrading and giving my 3600 to my brother for his
[9109.22 --> 9113.78]  pc okay well you've got a 3600 did you ever feel like you needed more cores and then i think that's
[9113.78 --> 9119.78]  the answer to your question uh anonymous any way we can get the size of the garment that folks are
[9119.78 --> 9123.70]  wearing in the description of the story yes we're working on that luke are we ever going to do that or is
[9123.70 --> 9127.30]  that a nick thing i think that's a nick thing yeah i think i think the easiest way to do it would just
[9127.30 --> 9131.70]  be to photo edit and just add a little size icon in the corner of each one of the photos so that'll
[9131.70 --> 9136.98]  take a long time but um it's something that we will do you could do it moving forward uh we should
[9136.98 --> 9142.98]  um nick knows it's on his list so you can just assume that he has other stuff that will happen it
[9142.98 --> 9148.42]  already like right now if you click on like a combination of things it should go down to that wait
[9148.42 --> 9152.10]  does it work for sizes probably no it doesn't it works for color variants though okay yeah
[9152.10 --> 9156.82]  dr gizmo as soon as i saw luke with the dark aqua hoodie i knew i had to get one
[9156.82 --> 9160.82]  uh a lot of a lot of really positive comments on this i didn't have a good experience with the
[9160.82 --> 9168.26]  crew neck sweater really contact support yep contact support um yeah the crew neck sweater is honestly
[9168.26 --> 9175.46]  like it's the uh it's the it's the it's the uh what would i call it it's the everyone i know
[9175.46 --> 9183.30]  internally who took one home had it stolen by their so ivan took mine the swacket jake's girlfriend
[9183.30 --> 9188.98]  took his my swacket was gone like immediately your girlfriend take your uh crew neck sweater oh yeah
[9188.98 --> 9193.14]  yeah yeah so those are the three that i know of where they like took it home and were like
[9193.14 --> 9197.86]  i love this thing i'm gonna wear it all the time i found it the other day because she she stores it away
[9197.86 --> 9204.82]  from like my stuff so that she can get it and i figured out where she keeps it but yeah yeah she
[9204.82 --> 9209.22]  took your swacket she took my swacket like immediately it was on the back of my chair
[9210.50 --> 9215.22]  and i got up like a few hours later and it was gone and i was like wait what and then she comes
[9215.22 --> 9222.18]  walking by she's wearing i was like when did you take that i was literally sitting here i didn't even
[9222.18 --> 9229.86]  realize ridiculous i don't know i'm surprised i'm surprised that's her style she just all my like
[9230.74 --> 9236.82]  you know second layer things just almost always just gone immediately there's certain stuff where
[9236.82 --> 9245.30]  i i i have to like sit down and be like this one's mine like please don't take this one stop if i don't
[9245.30 --> 9251.78]  do that it's it's gone yeah uh anonymous asks could brandon do a beginner's camera guide on ltt we've done
[9251.78 --> 9255.86]  some content around that but honestly it did not perform very well so that's the reason that we
[9255.86 --> 9260.82]  haven't really revisited it uh luke d says floatplane question why do i have to subscribe to floatplane
[9260.82 --> 9266.10]  for something that's free on twitch and i think youtube sorry what's free on twitch i think he's
[9266.10 --> 9272.26]  talking about wanshow so on on there's a there's a few cool things about floatplane the main most
[9272.26 --> 9277.38]  sellable one probably is full plan exclusives uh that's content that is exclusive to floatplane uh
[9277.38 --> 9281.54]  there's some really cool stuff in there it's stuff that probably wouldn't perform super well
[9281.78 --> 9286.18]  on the external channels which is kind of part of the reason why but it's like meet the team some
[9286.18 --> 9290.26]  behind the scenes stuff there's some cool things in there uh in addition to that you get really high
[9290.26 --> 9296.34]  quality video you get a more curated chat with hard audio people and audio don't forget the audio is
[9296.34 --> 9301.38]  uh full quality it's actually one of my favorite parts um but yeah it's it's it's a different
[9301.38 --> 9306.98]  experience it's not the same thing as the other platforms um yes wanshow is on all three platforms
[9306.98 --> 9314.10]  yep uh christopher asks minecraft server 1.18 update for survival looking for a chill place to
[9314.10 --> 9322.34]  play the update um that's a jake question uh i have no idea i have almost literally nothing to do with
[9322.34 --> 9328.34]  the minecraft thing uh travisy can you talk about the design of the zipper on the new hoodie so we were
[9328.34 --> 9332.42]  just trying to do something a little bit different it's still a ykk zipper it just has this little like
[9332.42 --> 9336.90]  it feels nice thing on it it has like a little textured pole and we just we thought it was kind
[9336.90 --> 9343.46]  of cool that's about it i i mean you know what bridgette or uh hannah might be able to give you
[9343.46 --> 9349.78]  more detail about why we went with this particular design but i i don't know a lot of the time i will
[9349.78 --> 9356.02]  offer my opinions but then i i really do like to defer to the people who have been creating garments for
[9356.02 --> 9362.10]  many years because they know better than i do in a lot of cases their thing yeah garrett asks will
[9362.10 --> 9365.54]  the backpack have a suitcase handle pocket so it can sit on top of your suitcase we're going to try
[9366.18 --> 9372.66]  uh we have an idea for how we can do it without uh reducing its wearability as a backpack and if it
[9372.66 --> 9375.14]  works then we're going to do it and if it doesn't work then we're going to kill it
[9377.70 --> 9381.86]  ah man we got to get through these okay uh i got we got to call it at some point here ladies and
[9381.86 --> 9384.98]  gentlemen robert b have you ever considered making the wang show available as a button oh
[9386.42 --> 9390.58]  question for left friend this one's already done as well i think this is yeah why are these not
[9390.58 --> 9397.54]  disappearing uh did we skip ahead no i'm clicking archive and they're not moving oh not for me either
[9397.54 --> 9404.82]  we're just gonna scroll past them okay oh wow okay most of these i think i've done a recent review of
[9406.34 --> 9410.98]  oh yeah did we actually finish and it just like looped or something maybe we finished
[9410.98 --> 9420.26]  i think we finished i think we did nice hey oh okay wait yes nice maybe refresh your page conrad
[9420.26 --> 9428.42]  suggests i'm gonna go for it yeah i'm doing it too oh okay so that's working so yeah we're good
[9430.10 --> 9435.54]  well why don't you all have a wonderful weekend then yeah thanks for tuning into the wan show and
[9435.54 --> 9443.70]  thanks for apparently the indoor hoodie is um a hit so that's pretty sweet thanks for thanks for
[9443.70 --> 9451.78]  supporting lttstore.com and all of that wow okay um neat wow yeah thanks guys okay
[9451.78 --> 9456.18]  um
[9456.18 --> 9458.26]  we need that right now so that works yeah
[9460.50 --> 9463.78]  not to go do it too much but yeah that's cool
[9467.70 --> 9468.02]  bye
[9468.02 --> 9476.02]  imagine that bye
[9476.02 --> 9484.74]  by the way thanks todd h got that last merch message in there picked up both colors
[9485.46 --> 9487.30]  i mean when you can't choose right it's the obvious solution
[9487.30 --> 9488.82]  yeah
[9493.78 --> 9496.50]  i'm not gonna lie i was unsure about this color when he first handed it to me
[9497.30 --> 9512.58]  and then the second i saw it on me on camera i was like oh it looks pretty good
