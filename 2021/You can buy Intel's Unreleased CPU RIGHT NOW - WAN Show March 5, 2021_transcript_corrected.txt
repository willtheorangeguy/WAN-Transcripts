[0.00 → 9.80] and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you today
[9.80 → 17.92] a non-tech has published an early full review of intel's upcoming rocket lake 10 excuse me 10
[17.92 → 26.98] old habit excuse me 11 700k processor in advance of the review embargo how did they do this they
[26.98 → 33.94] went to the store and bought one fascinating in other news we are going to be letting you guys
[33.94 → 39.88] know how the verified actual gamer program will be working I posted on Twitter a little while ago
[39.88 → 48.82] that we have a palette worth of RTX 3080s ready to rock ready to put in the hands of verified actual
[48.82 → 55.14] gamers for their MSRP with no scalper markups, and we are going to be giving you guys the full skinny
[55.14 → 62.14] on that whole program because let me put it this way it is more than what I already showed you in
[62.14 → 70.84] the tweet uh-huh what do you get Luke I will be trying to make sure that Linus doesn't leak
[70.84 → 79.34] unnecessary information about the verified actual gamer program good luck also uh google is a
[79.34 → 84.10] privacy company now there's some weird stuff going on their back in 2019 they made some announcements
[84.10 → 90.70] and now they're doing things about it, and it just feels weird and strange and odd uh also there is
[90.70 → 99.04] an Arizona house uh bill requiring allowance for third-party payments on app platforms interesting
[99.04 → 105.84] fascinating even with all that lobbying probably won't go through that, but we'll see let's roll that
[105.84 → 110.08] oh it passed what okay yeah we'll talk about that more later
[110.08 → 116.44] oh is there no audio oh yeah there is
[116.44 → 135.28] all right so why don't we jump right into the headline topic hold on oh I well I wanted
[135.28 → 143.50] to tell them about the headline topic Luke hold on I will hold on I feel robbed what did I do
[143.50 → 152.32] where's the new intro i know i just i forgot, and you forgot is it made i I'd have no
[152.32 → 159.62] idea I didn't even ask I'm sorry okay no new intro this week next week all right
[159.62 → 169.98] Nantes has published their full review of the Intel Core i7 11 700k nearly two weeks early
[169.98 → 176.62] like it's one thing if they get an engineering sample like Tom's hardware always used to do and
[176.62 → 183.72] it's like oh yeah well we've got some numbers, but they aren't final no final, but this is final hardware
[183.72 → 192.34] how'd they get it they bought it from a European retailer for the equivalent of 469 us dollars nice
[192.34 → 198.48] nice one quick thing before you keep going uh sponsors announcements uh sponsor
[198.48 → 203.14] announcements I don't think you did that at the end of the intro oh uh oh yes our sponsors for the
[203.14 → 214.10] show today are I'm not sure ah yes redux ridge wallet and Squarespace okay so here's how this works
[214.10 → 224.66] normally a publication like a non-tech like us would have a NDA with intel that would prevent them
[224.66 → 231.58] from publishing a review of a product that has is not yet released that has not yet uh had the embargo
[231.58 → 239.98] lifted on it but the way that a NDA works is if you can demonstrate that the information did not
[239.98 → 248.14] originate from you that it was already out in the wild the NDA is thereby deemed null and void so for
[248.14 → 255.46] example if I were to make Luke sign a NDA that he can never tell the world that my eyes are actually
[255.46 → 263.96] green for example and I wear brown contacts because I don't want anyone to know yeah that'd be bad
[263.96 → 271.04] then if Luke broke that news I could sue him for whatever kinds of damages I feel I'm entitled to
[271.04 → 276.80] because of you know the fact that you guys found out oh good heavens I have green eyes or whatever
[276.80 → 285.38] the case may be but if some you know paparazzo or whatever what's the singular form of paparazzi
[285.38 → 290.88] i I can't remember if some paparazzi not single singular is it not one of those words that they
[290.88 → 296.38] like it's singular and plural I'm not sure the point is if some rogue photographer managed to
[296.38 → 303.28] catch me before I got up and put myself together in the morning with green eyes and posted on Reddit
[303.28 → 311.24] and Luke were to say yeah he's got green eyes I would say hey Luke because you could have at least
[311.24 → 317.22] like helped me keep this under wraps but I would have no legal recourse because that information was
[317.22 → 326.92] already out there all Luke did was kind of shrug and go yeah, and so he hasn't actually broken the
[326.92 → 335.84] NDA he just isn't helping to keep it anymore because it's disclosed anyway yeah yeah it's already it's
[335.84 → 342.54] already public knowledge so by the way you were correct its paparazzo oh nice so Luke are excuse me
[342.54 → 350.70] so Nantes yeah they might have a signed NDA with intel, but there's absolutely nothing intel can do
[350.70 → 357.68] when it comes to a product that Nantes goes and buys because the deal with an embargo with a NDA is
[357.68 → 366.80] we provide you chip you give unbiased review so if we never provide you chip, and you decide you give
[366.80 → 372.60] unbiased review all the other terms of the agreement are basically unenforceable in fact
[372.60 → 379.06] this is kind of crazy they actually notified intel that they had the processor this is a quote from the
[379.06 → 386.76] review our and this is great they said they have it and uh-huh the response this is really weird
[386.76 → 395.22] our email to intel seemingly generated some excitement inside and to our surprise outside of intel
[395.22 → 400.20] but we received a response from intel stating that they had no comment to offer
[400.20 → 409.60] regarding rumours about early retail availability intel told Nantes we take our embargo agreement
[409.60 → 420.14] seriously and are following up as appropriate well um let me give you a little clue intel 11 700k
[420.14 → 425.20] okay bye hold on let's do a little display capture here let's see if maybe we can find this
[425.20 → 433.98] this rogue processor I guess we're going to try real hard let's see let's see where to buy
[433.98 → 446.60] okay we don't know oh we don't know where to buy it wow that's a lot of ads Amazon new egg scan
[446.60 → 453.76] overclockers okay well they don't know they don't know the news okay let's keep going here we go oh
[453.76 → 464.32] second link let's try again if oh the price might shock you what a headline thank you tech radar
[464.32 → 471.12] it's still up at the time of writing wow that was really hard intel is sure doing an amazing
[471.12 → 479.92] super awesome good job of following this up and making sure that mindfactory.de does not sell any
[479.92 → 486.30] more of these core i7 11 700ks you know what the craziest part of this is Luke
[486.30 → 497.56] mindfactory.de actually lists right on the product how many they've sold so you can actually see they
[497.56 → 506.04] are a pretty small time seller they sold 5600 10 700ks over the entire lifetime of the product
[506.04 → 513.34] and even though this is an early product that I would think with all the shortages on CPUs right
[513.34 → 519.28] now gamers would be pretty eager to get their hands on they've sold over 240
[519.28 → 531.12] 240 well that was sure worth it 240 whole CPUs to all in the interest of or like what I mean at
[531.12 → 539.64] what cost right all you did was like off every other retailer on the planet and probably intel and
[539.64 → 547.48] definitely me because I'm pretty annoyed I mean yeah that makes sense like it's supposed to be that
[547.48 → 553.86] you compete with other media outlets on the merit of your coverage right but when it's like this
[553.86 → 561.24] all of a sudden it's just like a mad grab for who has the best back alley contacts to source the product
[561.24 → 569.20] uh earlier right like it the whole idea behind being a reviewer and having this is a dirty move
[569.20 → 578.70] for a reviewer to do um if is Joe and Bob's computer shop down the street yeah had one for some reason
[578.70 → 582.18] would you buy it and do a review or no
[582.18 → 597.28] yeah I'd do it yep, yep so any anger that I have is going to be directed towards the
[597.28 → 603.80] inadequacy of intel systems to prevent something like this from happening because everybody knows
[603.80 → 612.76] the second the product is in the hands of our retail partner it's out it's out if you don't do
[612.76 → 618.86] it if an ant tech doesn't do it if is someone else doesn't do it there's going to be another person in
[618.86 → 623.12] line that is going to do it exactly it's going to happen, or a review is going to come out it's going
[623.12 → 627.64] to be leaked if it's is it's in re if it's on a retail shelf, and you can buy it, it's out that's
[627.64 → 635.30] the whole reason that trusted partners who abide by embargoes are supposed to have the product
[635.30 → 641.92] like two weeks at three weeks ahead of time so that as long as we're on the ball, and we're working
[641.92 → 648.32] on the thing right away if something like this were to happen and some retailer goes early we at least
[648.32 → 655.84] have the flexibility to make a move like we can call up intel be like okay look um clearly this
[655.84 → 661.96] embargo is dead it's dead as a doornail so we need to go live with this thing before all the
[661.96 → 669.72] you know Joes on forums are posting about it and people are confused and don't know what kind of
[669.72 → 675.48] performance they're supposed to expect there's no there are no reviews um like we need to just go for
[675.48 → 680.84] it and I mean we had something like this happen actually with the 8k gaming experience that we did
[680.84 → 688.86] with the RTX 3090 uh there was some kind of something happened uh I have some ideas exactly what happened
[688.86 → 697.82] but um there was a certain order that those videos were supposed to go up and that didn't happen
[697.82 → 703.88] and so fortunately because we were on the ball we had access to the product early we had
[703.88 → 711.44] our video ready to go, and we were able to click publish right away because it was ready so right
[711.44 → 718.06] now I mean I don't know it's a funny thing because like I'm technically still under NDA for the 11 700k
[718.06 → 724.50] which means not only can I not comment on the performance and the price and I mean you can see
[724.50 → 730.50] the price is right there but I couldn't comment on a Canadian or American price which is how i typically
[730.50 → 736.30] get pricing so I can't comment on the price um i you can comment on the performance can't you
[736.30 → 743.00] um I guess I could now because it's in their article except okay so here's where we get into a bit of the
[743.00 → 749.44] nuance so one of the things that I can't comment on is any terms of the NDA that have not been disclosed
[749.44 → 757.06] so for example if there was a particular uh embargo lift time that intel hadn't disclosed I wouldn't even be
[757.06 → 764.16] able to tell you when I will be able to tell you another thing is that because we are going to be
[764.16 → 770.40] getting a chip from intel and using that for our benchmarking I actually cannot publish my own
[770.40 → 776.42] benchmarks so I could tell you a non-text numbers i could just repeat those I could make a video about
[776.42 → 782.44] it because that's out there but if we do our own measurements, and we do our own analysis
[782.44 → 792.32] analysis that is now our data, and we could well we would be restricted in terms of what we
[792.32 → 798.98] can tell you by the terms of our NDA so at risk of breaking my NDA because I feel like this is
[798.98 → 805.38] information that you know can't really hurt anyone too much I don't even have one yet so
[805.38 → 814.70] we are in absolutely no position whatsoever to respond to this because intel went and got product
[814.70 → 824.32] out there in distribution to retail partners before even seeding media um or at least us I mean it's
[824.32 → 830.98] quite possible that others have it already I know that um der Bauer Roman often gets stuff early because
[830.98 → 837.16] he's involved in things like overclocking validation in addition to being a reviewer for example
[837.16 → 846.56] right so I'm pretty annoyed but I'm annoyed mostly with intel not with a non-tech if I was them I'd have
[846.56 → 852.92] done the exact same thing I even got an I even got a little message from IAN got a cute little
[852.92 → 860.08] message from dr sutras over here what the heck did he say this guy he's adorable he's adorable
[860.08 → 867.38] he's like teepee no he didn't actually write teepee yeah I was like that doesn't really sound like
[867.38 → 873.90] he goes got something coming out late you might want to talk about on wan show just FYI look at this
[873.90 → 884.30] guy look at this look at this clout chasing mother okay he knows I can't resist it
[884.30 → 890.94] he knows that's why i have to talk about dr sutras on the show so anyway he sends me a link to the
[890.94 → 896.18] article so Anthony went through it since it's out there why don't we talk about the numbers from
[896.18 → 904.18] dr sutras over at anon tech and tektekpotato his YouTube channel the chip itself do you want to run
[904.18 → 909.42] us through it Luke I feel like I've done a lot of talking its um so because we're going off of their
[909.42 → 915.48] numbers uh i I believe this was Anthony laid it out this way I think it's actually pretty cool the
[915.48 → 919.66] way he laid it out so I'm just going to run through this instead of scraping off of their review I was
[919.66 → 925.46] originally looking through their review trying to pull some data points whatever um so it is runs
[925.46 → 932.76] real hot we know that much um how does it perform it performs significantly worse
[932.76 → 941.72] than the dozen 7 5800x in 3d particle movement AI benchmarks digit cortex small dwarf fortress worlds
[941.72 → 951.84] corona benchmark crisis CPU only v-ray cine bench r20 hand bake a hand break 4k 60 uh all archiving tests
[951.84 → 959.64] all JavaScript web browser tests and spec inch 2017 okay it performs slightly worse wait hold on a second
[959.64 → 966.12] I was about to say, but we would expect that because it has significantly fewer cores than a 5800x oops no i
[966.12 → 977.00] misread that it actually has the same number of cores as a 5800x um it performs slightly worse than that
[977.00 → 984.12] same uh processor in the y cruncher multi-thread Ubisoft photo scan gimp application launch named
[984.12 → 995.24] ap o a1 simulation and all gaming tests other than some at uh notably high resolutions um it is on par
[995.24 → 1003.24] with said processor in blender mid-sized and large door fortress worlds handbrake 480p discord
[1004.36 → 1011.56] and spec 2017 it's essentially there are very few things that it's on par with it there's even fewer
[1011.56 → 1017.48] things that are significantly better dwarf fortress okay is that's my favourite best on this list i just
[1017.48 → 1023.64] have to say it's best played in medium and large sized worlds okay if you're playing dwarf fortress
[1023.64 → 1029.72] can I just say for a second that if you're playing dwarf fortress in a small world then you are you're a
[1029.72 → 1036.28] big piece of okay you're not a gamer your human garbage okay whoa
[1036.28 → 1045.64] that's like your measure of man how big your dwarf fortress world is I'm not even actually familiar
[1045.64 → 1051.00] with this benchmark i I don't even know exactly what the benchmark is maybe either that's I know
[1051.00 → 1057.32] it's my favourite one it's an ancient like text-based game that we used to play on like crappy netbooks so
[1057.32 → 1064.60] I don't really understand but I'll uh I'll trust an Aztec on that one um but yeah it's only slightly
[1064.60 → 1069.72] better than that process or significant sorry it's only significantly better than that pro than the
[1069.72 → 1077.64] dozen 7 5800x to be clear in 3d particle movement peak AVX by a factor of nearly six which is pretty
[1077.64 → 1085.88] wild and y cruncher single threaded okay so it's the single thread king when it comes to calculating pi
[1085.88 → 1098.68] I'm not going to lie I had um I had higher expectations uh based on the scuttlebutt that I had heard in the
[1098.68 → 1106.52] industry I was thinking that intel was giving up those two cores because remember this is an eight core
[1106.52 → 1112.20] chip that seems to be coming in as a direct replacement for a 10 core chip
[1112.20 → 1120.12] which means that I was under the impression that intel would be giving up those two cores
[1120.12 → 1126.28] for some very significant single threaded performance gains like I thought they were
[1126.28 → 1133.48] going to come back absolutely all guns ablaze and taking the gaming crown like that that that was my
[1133.48 → 1140.12] expectation now maybe if I hadn't read any of the rumours and I had thought that this was just going to be
[1140.12 → 1150.04] yet another sort of 14 nanometers reheated CPU you now and then and then whoa we ended up with a
[1150.04 → 1157.24] floating point performance gain of 19 over 10th gen and integer performance gain of 7 to 13 over 10th gen
[1157.96 → 1161.88] I might have been impressed I might have been really happy because I'd be like oh wow I was expecting
[1161.88 → 1167.40] basically nothing and I got a lot more than nothing I got a pretty solid generational performance
[1167.40 → 1173.56] improvement but i i I don't know I was just expecting I was expecting it to come back
[1173.56 → 1182.04] absolutely for people purchasing processors do you think it's going to matter almost at all well no
[1182.04 → 1188.92] because and let me get into that so a non-text review has a conclusion here that I think is
[1188.92 → 1197.40] is interesting um rocket lake has some regressions in core to core performance and its memory latency
[1197.40 → 1202.60] profile so okay that's what happens when you're making a significant architectural change I suppose
[1202.60 → 1207.80] instead of just releasing the same game same CPU over and over again in different packages is
[1208.36 → 1212.20] you're not talking about Ea we're talking about intel yeah yeah we'll gain here we'll lose there thank
[1212.20 → 1219.64] you Luke that was good i I liked it i I quite enjoyed that um, and then they go on to say our
[1219.64 → 1226.44] results clearly show that intel's performance while substantial still trails its main competitor AMD
[1226.44 → 1233.00] in a core for core comparison intel is slightly slower and a lot more inefficient the smart money would
[1233.00 → 1242.12] be to get the AMD processor except that I think that dr Curtis may have overlooked something let's go ahead
[1242.12 → 1251.08] and revisit my screen for a moment here shall we this right here is a core i7 1100k and I don't actually
[1251.08 → 1256.20] know what the US pricing is going to be because Anthony's the one who sits on the intel briefings now not me
[1256.20 → 1263.32] so it's possible he knows but I don't but what I do know is that typically the way that pricing works from
[1263.32 → 1269.32] region to region its region to region excuse me is that Europe gets absolutely on
[1269.32 → 1274.76] because even though their currency is worth a lot more than ours it tends to be pretty dangerously
[1274.76 → 1280.84] close to a one-to-one exchange rate in terms of product pricing so I think it's fairly safe to say
[1280.84 → 1290.28] then that a core i7 11 700k is going to cost less than 500 in the good old us and a so let's go ahead
[1290.28 → 1301.24] and try to buy a 5800x shall we hmm I don't think you read the rest of the conclusion me yeah oh
[1302.36 → 1308.92] well hit me with that so he goes on to say the smart money would like you said however due to high
[1308.92 → 1313.32] demand and prioritizing commercial and enterprise contracts the only parts readily available on retail
[1313.32 → 1318.68] shelves right now are from intel normally this is where I would conclude with a comment on what to recommend
[1318.68 → 1323.88] but the clear answer during this chip crunch is to buy the processor you can buy the processor you can
[1323.88 → 1332.20] find at a reasonable price well there you go I lied also the 5800x is in stock at amazon.com right now
[1332.20 → 1340.76] I mean there's 189 of shipping and import fees if you ship it to Canada wouldn't really recommend that
[1340.76 → 1349.96] but it seems possible that this is actually that this is actually in stock right now for 449.99
[1349.96 → 1351.80] what's the MSRP of this thing supposed to be
[1355.80 → 1367.80] 5800 there we go 449.uh-huh okay uh well if you needed one of these nows a good time um
[1367.80 → 1374.28] um hey wait don't forget to use our affiliate link oh wow the 5900x on the other hand doesn't even like
[1374.28 → 1384.68] return a result so that's pretty sweet cool all right, so thank you dr Curtis for actually indeed
[1384.68 → 1389.32] getting all those details in your review I knew I could count on you to be thorough I was hoping to
[1389.32 → 1393.32] embarrass you but uh you always get the drop on me don't you IAN
[1395.64 → 1398.44] tech potato is still a bad name for a YouTube channel okay
[1401.96 → 1404.68] what topic do you want to hit next got him
[1408.44 → 1418.28] we can talk more about how uh NVIDIA's is working with GPU miners oh can we oh good sure that
[1418.28 → 1429.32] sounds great super fun okay hit me uh the know the 3080 ETH mining wait isn't it the 3060 ti
[1431.80 → 1436.84] the Ethereum mining limiter rumoured to uh to be present on other cards is rumoured to be present
[1436.84 → 1444.20] on the 3080 ti as well or 3060 i just dyslexia the heck out of this title I'm sorry the 3060
[1444.20 → 1450.52] ETH mining limiter is rumoured to be on the 3080 ti as well um
[1452.60 → 1457.80] I'm changing I'm changing the dog while you're trying to that is so rude I saw that right at the
[1457.80 → 1464.44] end I'm like hold on a second it is the one on the 3060 it is the one on the 3060.
[1464.44 → 1469.80] you were right you were right it was wrong in the dock you were right and then I changed it to the right
[1469.80 → 1473.16] thing and then I changed it back to the wrong thing I'm just messing with them sorry guys oh okay go
[1473.16 → 1479.88] ahead you're so red right now it's great uh they were previously correct so the leaker that leaked
[1479.88 → 1489.32] this uh capita 7 chili sure hoping I'm saying that right um has leaked potential specs and info for the
[1489.32 → 1496.92] upcoming 3080 ti including a rumour that it has the same ETH mining limiter as the recently released 3060.
[1496.92 → 1502.92] they were previously correct about ampere months ahead of launch um so it should have 12 gigabytes of
[1502.92 → 1511.56] DDR at uh width of you keep clicking on things so I can't read it with 384 bits
[1513.00 → 1524.60] um ga102 10 240 kudu cores okay what is life any more um and apparently with the ETH mining limiter present
[1524.60 → 1529.72] it is scheduled for an April launch uh apparently NVIDIA has changed the date three times moving
[1529.72 → 1535.32] it back from the initial plan date of January and there has been no price revealed yet yeah we were
[1535.32 → 1545.64] expecting that there was going to be a 3080 ti alongside uh mobile RTX 30 series at CES this year and
[1545.64 → 1553.64] so it sounds this story sounds kind of consistent with the reality that I've been living in um I mean
[1553.64 → 1561.64] kudos to NVIDIA for one thing for delaying this card when they know they can't ship anything else as it is
[1561.64 → 1568.76] um I mean i it's just it just feels kind of laughable to me like maybe I don't know maybe this is a bad take
[1568.76 → 1574.84] but I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put it out there anyway NVIDIA and AMD both took the approach
[1574.84 → 1581.80] this time around of launching their new stacks top to bottom right so NVIDIA led with the very high-end
[1581.80 → 1587.96] stuff followed up with you know your 3070 and then your 3060 ti like in their typical fashion
[1587.96 → 1595.24] AMD started with the 58 and 50 excuse me 68 and 6900 series um now they're filling out the gaps
[1595.24 → 1601.00] with their upcoming uh what's what's the one they're launching 6700 or something like that
[1601.00 → 1607.64] uh is it an x yeah I think it's a 6700 XT um sorry there's a lot of there's a lot of model numbers in
[1607.64 → 1614.76] my brain going back many years, and it really doesn't help that AMD is launching a 6800 when NVIDIA
[1614.76 → 1622.92] has also had 6800s and AMD has also had 6800s in the past it's its hard to keep the wires from getting
[1622.92 → 1628.28] crossed at a certain point anyway it just maybe this is a bad take but I'm kind of looking at it
[1628.28 → 1637.64] going okay NVIDIA if you can sell 3080s all day long, and we know that you're going to have to give up
[1637.64 → 1647.80] some of the fab capacity that you planned to use or that you could use for 3080s to build 3070s or 3060
[1647.80 → 1657.32] TTI's or 3060s but the 3080 is a thousand dollar plus card why don't you just make those for a while
[1657.96 → 1666.84] until like i'm on I'm honestly here from like uh from like a brutal capitalistic standpoint
[1667.96 → 1675.88] yes you can move a lot of more volume of a 400 or 500 card compared to a thousand or fifteen hundred
[1675.88 → 1684.12] dollar card or whatever the case may be but if you don't have to move more volume I'm pretty sure
[1684.12 → 1692.12] that everything that I know about like selling things um would indicate that higher average sell prices
[1692.12 → 1700.36] are better fewer larger transactions is easier than many more smaller transactions as a general rule
[1700.36 → 1710.36] now there is also the chance that you know you could create uh negativity in the community
[1710.36 → 1718.36] by only catering to you know the very high end it's also very likely that NVIDIA had already committed
[1718.36 → 1725.80] to well they did already commit to 3090 3080 and 3070 at the same time but what they hadn't committed
[1725.80 → 1731.16] to already was oh, and they had probably also committed to turn off their production on the
[1731.16 → 1738.20] previous node of their 20 series what they hadn't committed to yet was the 3060 series and AMD for
[1738.20 → 1745.00] that matter hadn't already committed to launch the 6700 so if you already can't deliver enough of your
[1745.00 → 1752.36] flagship parts why unless they're made of failed flagship parts which in some cases these new products have
[1752.36 → 1759.16] not been why are you trying to launch more products that are just going to make another subset of your
[1759.16 → 1766.52] customer base mad because they can't get it like if I'm someone who's waiting for a 399 you know like
[1766.52 → 1771.88] a 400 card replacement because that's kind of that's like that's how much I spend on a graphics card
[1772.76 → 1777.24] I might get impatient because you haven't launched a next-gen replacement for me
[1777.24 → 1784.44] but I'm not going to be furious that you've launched one at this supposed price and I can't
[1784.44 → 1792.68] get it because it costs 900 or 1100 dollars or whatever like what does it what's a 3060 go for
[1792.68 → 1801.00] one bay right now like what would you go for almost four grand I know that much what would I do I'm just
[1801.00 → 1807.00] not buying a card well okay this is not a buyer's market no, no if you were in video though
[1807.24 → 1810.84] or AMD if you're AMD do you launch a card today a new card
[1814.20 → 1820.36] no i the thing is though that this may have been planned out so much further in the past they
[1820.36 → 1823.80] might already have the packaging for it, they might already have like the logistics and everything
[1823.80 → 1829.88] planned already it might be more damaging to not go through the motions I don't know enough
[1829.88 → 1834.92] about it to say that but yeah no, no no that's that's totally fair I mean it's very, very possible that
[1834.92 → 1840.84] they booked the capacity built these chips they're already in the pipeline to the board
[1840.84 → 1846.04] partners like sure yeah that's that's totally fair it's just
[1850.12 → 1858.20] it's just a little bit weird optics yeah for sure yeah definitely okay it looks like a brand new RTX 3060
[1858.20 → 1867.24] is going for uh 800 bucks will get you uh some total one 900 bucks will get you a tough gaming OC
[1867.96 → 1876.04] and then the ti is up more like in the 1200 range to start with up 12 that's wild 1300 for a founder's
[1876.04 → 1884.28] edition like that is utter madness if you have a perfectly capable GPU right now, and it blows
[1884.28 → 1894.12] like it dies I feel very bad for you yeah that's rough if only someone was doing something to make
[1894.12 → 1905.00] sure that people can buy graphics cards at MSRP without a scalper markup if only someone would make sure
[1905.00 → 1911.32] that verified actual gamers get their hands on graphics cards
[1914.92 → 1920.04] who will answer this call Luke who will answer this call I don't think anyone it's way too hard
[1920.92 → 1926.52] there's i I can't imagine because it would have to be someone new right it couldn't be someone in this
[1926.52 → 1931.08] space already they'd have to have relationships with board partners they'd have to be able to get
[1931.08 → 1936.44] allocation yep getting units is going to be tough the board partners would probably have to be on
[1936.44 → 1945.56] board with it yep no pun intended oh yeah I liked it I liked it okay it's impossible so it's time for
[1945.56 → 1955.16] the big reveal sometime next week we will be launching the verified actual gamer program for our first drop
[1955.16 → 1963.48] I don't want to overpromise to you guys we are working with Asus okay we have only between I don't
[1963.48 → 1970.76] know exactly how many we have it's between 80 and 100 cards I'm going to be I'm going to give you guys too much
[1970.76 → 1976.04] detail okay I'm going to be honest with you guys in a way that could get me in trouble the reason I don't
[1976.04 → 1982.92] know exactly how many are coming is because one of the piece of middlemen that was involved in this transaction
[1982.92 → 1993.48] uh kind of Sophie daisies accidentally lost or what really happened was sold to someone else
[1993.48 → 1998.28] some of the cards that were supposed to come to me for the verified actual gamer program
[1998.28 → 2003.96] um oh hold on a second nick is calling me he's real upset what do you want
[2006.20 → 2009.84] about what hold on hold on just tell me just tell me what's going on
[2012.92 → 2025.24] i think he's muted but I think I'm still with you, I think I'm still here I have no idea
[2025.24 → 2029.16] what's going on at this point i knew about the system I knew about the plan I was trying to hype
[2029.16 → 2034.92] it up I didn't know about this part of the story I didn't expect nick to call, so the point is the point
[2034.92 → 2041.16] is I don't know exactly how many of them we're going to have, but we have done some really cool work
[2041.16 → 2047.56] to make sure that when these things are available in the way that they will be available there is
[2048.12 → 2055.48] I'm nothing is perfect, but there is a very very very high probability that every single one of them
[2055.48 → 2061.16] will make their way into the hands of a verified actual gamer so we're not giving you guys the full
[2061.16 → 2067.88] details this second but Luke and some of the other guys on the float plane team have been hard at work
[2067.88 → 2073.24] on this from a development side from the development side of things and what you're going to want to do
[2073.96 → 2083.24] is if you're a real gamer and if you need a graphics card okay so we've got some RTX 3080s RTX 3090s
[2083.24 → 2095.16] and I believe I am allowed to tease that we are also working with AMD on some products that AMD sells
[2095.16 → 2102.68] and we are also working with MSI on some products that MSI sells, so this is all going to be happening
[2102.68 → 2107.80] hopefully over the next few weeks what you are going to want to do to make sure that you are in
[2107.80 → 2113.64] the know and getting the info as early as possible is you're going to want to watch this episode of the
[2113.64 → 2120.60] wan show where I tell you guys what else you're going to need to do congratulations you already did that
[2120.60 → 2128.04] part the next thing you're going to need to do is you are going to need to make sure that you are
[2128.04 → 2135.72] subscribed on Linus tech tips you are watching every video the instant it goes live and the only way
[2135.72 → 2143.64] to do that is to make sure to ring the bell don't be a ding-dong okay that's Luke's joke that's Luke's joke
[2143.64 → 2148.76] don't be a ding-dong ring the ding-dong that's Luke's joke I'm not taking credit for that uh it
[2148.76 → 2155.32] may be that in the future I will uh take us over to maybe a different channel like short circuit for
[2155.32 → 2162.52] example uh, but it's quite likely that this is all going to be on the Linus tech tips channel
[2162.52 → 2169.32] another pro tip guys there is an even better way to see a Linus tech tips video right away when it
[2169.32 → 2177.80] launches than ringing the bell if you go back in time to the long, long ago of just looking at our
[2177.80 → 2183.80] publish history you'll see that there's a bit of a pattern to when we publish our videos I would
[2183.80 → 2192.28] suggest that it is likely that we will include this information somewhere in one of the videos that we
[2192.28 → 2202.12] published at our let's say typical time okay does that sound good to everybody there's a whole big
[2202.12 → 2207.08] thing in here that says don't say this part don't say this part should I say that part I don't think
[2207.08 → 2213.40] so no I don't think I'm going to say that part so we're really excited about this we're really excited
[2213.40 → 2220.52] to be working with Asus AMD and MSI those are the ones that we've uh that we've talked to about this
[2220.52 → 2226.28] program they have actually worked really hard to make this possible because as you guys may or may
[2226.28 → 2234.68] not know uh Linus media group incorporated is not exactly a retailer you know what I mean um so we don't
[2234.68 → 2240.68] we're not really set up to buy computer hardware in bulk um, so there was a lot of work from the
[2240.68 → 2249.24] creator warehouse team the flow plane team Asus AMD MSI getting all this stuff cleared um and trying to
[2249.24 → 2254.36] find a way to make it make sense for everyone and I can tell you right now the bottom line is that
[2254.36 → 2262.28] the only reason that any of this makes any sense is because they actually care they liked our idea
[2262.28 → 2270.04] uh, and they actually care about helping us get these products to verified actual gamers so I'm I'm super
[2270.04 → 2275.40] excited uh people like just say the part no no I'm not I'm not going to be saying the part i was
[2275.40 → 2279.48] just messing with loop uh that stuff i really don't want to talk about yet
[2283.08 → 2288.28] so stay tuned guys this is going to be I mean that's the stuff that's going to be in the video
[2289.32 → 2296.84] and that's why you need to ring the bell so flow plane oh uh Joe soap asks what about flow plane
[2296.84 → 2304.04] subscribers uh do I still need to check on YouTube we will make sure that the video launch like okay that
[2304.04 → 2309.80] the video launch is going to be at the same time on flow plane as on YouTube so you guys will get the
[2309.80 → 2316.60] same chance as everyone else but unfortunately I cannot give you guys any kind of advantage for
[2316.60 → 2324.20] the verified actual gamer program because if I did and float plane was a paid membership which it is
[2324.20 → 2331.56] then we would risk running afoul of lottery laws gambling laws which last time I checked get enforced pretty
[2332.12 → 2339.72] hardcore and I really do not want to deal with that my life does not need it okay does that kind of make
[2339.72 → 2347.40] sense guys Linus misses NCI so much he just remade it better faster and stronger thanks cyberdyne over on
[2347.40 → 2355.96] float plane exactly, exactly we're going we're going full circle here boys okay I started out making videos
[2355.96 → 2362.68] for a tech retailer and then now I'm going to be a tech retailer that wait no I started out making
[2362.68 → 2369.48] video now I'm going to be a video maker that turns into a tech retailer we got this we got this
[2370.68 → 2377.32] oh wait only in like drop form you rules asked is Quebec included it's not a giveaway it's just an
[2377.32 → 2383.00] opportunity to buy it at MSRP so yes, yes you can definitely buy it um
[2383.00 → 2389.72] um in response to anyone on staff who's watching this including at float plane and creator warehouse
[2390.36 → 2397.24] no you are not eligible unfortunately because you have access to the people either directly or
[2397.24 → 2404.36] indirectly who are working on this project you simply cannot have one and we will make sure
[2404.36 → 2410.84] you do not get one oh, oh poor float plane staff is in the chat we know
[2413.16 → 2423.00] yeah that's rough okay I'm sorry I'm sorry hopefully you guys are hyped we are expecting
[2423.00 → 2428.60] somewhere in the neighbourhood it's like honestly guys I don't want to set unrealistic expectations
[2428.60 → 2434.44] because can Ozzy's join the giveaway it's not a giveaway it's not a giveaway okay it's not a
[2434.44 → 2440.84] giveaway it's just a chance to buy them okay, so there are a few things that we need to clarify here one
[2440.84 → 2449.64] is that there is nothing we can do about tariffs if you are American and the stock that we get is uh
[2449.64 → 2458.68] not was not imported pre-tariff okay we actually do have some that came in pre-tariff still so that's
[2458.68 → 2463.40] how long we've been working on this that should give you some idea but if the stock we have which
[2463.40 → 2470.84] some of it will be is post tariff from the Trump administration we cannot do anything about that
[2470.84 → 2478.36] there will be a 25 surcharge cannot help you with it is just is what it is if you don't like it
[2478.36 → 2485.32] you tell your government you don't like it is has nothing to do with me same thing if you were to buy
[2485.32 → 2492.60] it from the EU for example there is nothing I can do about any kind of value-added tax or any other
[2492.60 → 2501.40] kinds of surcharges uh oh okay apparently I was mistaken we do not have any that are pre-tariff it did
[2501.40 → 2508.20] not end up working out that way so they are all ta riffed um someone's asking about postage costs
[2508.36 → 2514.44] you will have to pay separately for that we just to give you guys some idea we there are not
[2514.44 → 2523.08] a ton of margin in computer hardware guys like it's its a cut-throat business okay remember that time
[2523.08 → 2530.52] that new egg tried to go public, and it was revealed that their net profit was like one percent like it is
[2530.52 → 2535.88] not there's a reason I haven't tried to become a computer hardware retailer okay it's not that I don't
[2535.88 → 2540.36] know it's not that I don't have the relationships it's not that I don't know how to put a CPU in a
[2540.36 → 2547.88] box and ship it out the door it's because I want nothing to do with that business this is just about
[2547.88 → 2554.28] us making sure that whatever we can get our hands on we have bought as much as we can in bulk makes its
[2554.28 → 2562.44] way to verified actual gamers from our community all right um so yes if you are somewhere else in the
[2562.44 → 2568.12] world you will have to pay postage it's probably going to be brutal depending where you are because
[2568.12 → 2574.44] we don't have amazing rates with Canada post or FedEx or whoever else we're still a relatively small
[2574.44 → 2584.84] timer all right cool so why don't we move on my mic was needed sorry one second someone was asking
[2584.84 → 2592.68] what currency will the cards be listed in uh they'll be listed in USD yeah uh, but they will be
[2592.68 → 2598.36] listed at pre-tariff prices because for example if someone in Canada were to buy them they would not
[2598.36 → 2604.92] be subject to the U.S. tariffs so does that kind of make sense guys because we're in Canada we haven't
[2604.92 → 2613.48] paid a tariff on them yet you guys follow so if we ship them to the U.S. the second they touch U.S. soil
[2613.48 → 2619.96] they are subject to this 25 tariff again another potentially oh sorry yeah go ahead hit me another
[2619.96 → 2627.08] potentially tricky question is a moderator was asking what about them a moderator like on the
[2627.08 → 2633.80] forum like forum moderator discord moderator twitch chat moderator they to my knowledge they will
[2633.80 → 2639.48] have absolutely no it had nothing to do with this yeah they will have no early access to information
[2639.48 → 2647.40] and uh internally only i and nick and Luke are probably going to know exactly when the video
[2647.40 → 2655.00] is going to go live so I think that should be fine yep okay cool they are they can be verified actual
[2655.00 → 2664.84] gamers 100 nice all right let's go ahead and oh right that's a perfect point uh if you've had bad
[2664.84 → 2670.84] experiences with shipments from Canada before like grok 23 where they've taken a really long time
[2671.96 → 2677.72] maybe this just isn't the right deal for you uh because the last thing I want is for this to be
[2677.72 → 2684.44] stuck in you know shipping for two months which can happen absolutely and then for you to have a real bad
[2684.44 → 2690.68] time because some thousand dollar product is tied up for two months and by that time graphics card prices
[2690.68 → 2699.88] are back to sanity all right cool so why don't we move on to our next topic here the uh oh
[2699.88 → 2710.60] the sponsors for the show today hey redux.com redux is a pc builder that's striving to bring pc gaming to

[2876.20 → 2883.24] so tell me something Squarespace is the member area where I keep my member like
[2884.44 → 2889.72] would you like to pay uh to access my member area oh Lord
[2892.20 → 2903.80] I mean oh no oh boy that's uh man someone internally must have brought that up yeah I don't know it's one
[2903.80 → 2909.00] of those things like nobody called me on the name of the verified actual gamer program every company we've
[2909.00 → 2915.64] worked with yeah nobody was like you're really going to call it that I don't know man I mean maybe
[2915.64 → 2924.44] we just like maybe not everyone actually has a potty mind you know not everyone grew up listening to blink
[2924.44 → 2934.04] 182 I guess maybe it's that simple right maybe i just that seems so obvious uh oh boy we got some real
[2934.04 → 2939.64] questions about the verified actual gamer program up in here Alexis what if we were to pick up the
[2939.64 → 2947.88] card in Canada across the border a would be violating uh covid um restrictions so don't do that
[2949.16 → 2957.48] and b then you would have to pay tariffs because it would touch us soil there you go happy to help uh
[2957.48 → 2963.96] that's that's what I do it's awesome comments that looked like they were confused you're not avoiding
[2963.96 → 2970.44] the tariffs by buying a card in America to be clear yeah you still have to pay them that's why they're so
[2970.44 → 2977.72] expensive also it's part of why they're so expensive now yeah it happens when any card enters the states
[2977.72 → 2985.96] it doesn't matter how so what is this google is now a privacy company what does that even mean
[2985.96 → 2994.28] I okay let's go up to this it's uh help me out here Luke I'm I'm not helping right now it's its
[2994.28 → 3001.72] it's odd um so back in 2019 google announced that they had intent uh that they had intended wait that
[3001.72 → 3007.88] they had intent of working with other companies to build a more private web uh I remember this i
[3007.88 → 3014.52] believe we laughed um that does sound like what we would do and then moved on March 3rd a post on
[3014.52 → 3019.72] the official google blog followed this up with more information and bold statements that contrast
[3019.72 → 3025.56] uh google's data harvesting strategies yeah this is weird, and they have to have something up their
[3025.56 → 3031.08] sleeves I suspect there's something like google proprietary that they're working on, but we'll get
[3031.08 → 3037.00] into that in a moment to try to make it so that more stuff funnels through them by doing this but um
[3037.00 → 3043.24] um third party cookies also known as cross-site tracking cookies will be phased out in Google Chrome
[3045.64 → 3053.56] really hmm yeah google claims that they will not be building any alternate identifiers to track
[3053.56 → 3059.64] individuals sure as they're browsing the web and additionally that they will not use these trackers
[3060.44 → 3065.80] that they definitely super aren't building they're definitely not making anything okay hold on
[3065.80 → 3073.24] can i just jump in here and say is it possible that google has built an AI so powerful
[3073.88 → 3081.72] that it is like can infer everything about you just by the one site you're on like the one thing you're
[3081.72 → 3088.68] doing, and it doesn't even need the history any more so maybe google is just making it impossible for their
[3088.68 → 3096.60] less technologically advanced competitors to track you, but they've still got you nailed down i also
[3096.60 → 3103.24] wonder if there's just like if is is cookies are too accessible to other companies, and they have like
[3103.24 → 3110.36] it feels like they might be trying to heighten the barrier of entry yeah yeah that totally makes sense
[3110.36 → 3116.20] so they have other things already whether it's tracking through your phone whether it's tracking through your
[3116.20 → 3122.52] your email um all these other various things and they're thinking okay if we kill cookies yeah it's
[3122.52 → 3128.28] bad for us but maybe it's worse for others that's maybe something that I'm expecting here okay it's uh
[3128.92 → 3136.20] it's weird despite these altruistic uh it says in here intentions I'm going to say claims uh despite these
[3136.20 → 3141.64] altruistic claims google is still a business that needs to make money yes very much so and advertising
[3141.64 → 3146.28] makes up a substantial portion of the revenue not to mention if we're going to if we're going to be
[3146.28 → 3151.32] shown ads it's usually best for them to be relevant which tracking cookies facilitate yes of course in
[3151.32 → 3157.40] their post google writes advances in aggregation anonymization and on device processing and other
[3157.40 → 3165.08] privacy preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers in fact our latest tests
[3165.08 → 3173.64] of floc show one way to effectively take third-party cookies out of the advertising equation and instead
[3173.64 → 3179.72] hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests oh my so maybe you're on it
[3179.72 → 3188.20] chrome intends to make floc based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next
[3188.20 → 3194.92] release this month wow so i actually kind of like nailed it yep good job nice i actually I had
[3194.92 → 3201.72] not read the notes yet this is awesome basically your device will build a profile of you and you'll be
[3201.72 → 3209.64] put into a general category of interests as opposed to having a comprehensive pattern outline
[3209.64 → 3215.88] based on browsing history and form information in theory this should still be effective at advertising
[3215.88 → 3223.16] but also in preserving user privacy more strongly uh how this will function in practice is a story that only
[3223.16 → 3230.84] time will tell all right so I guess I have nothing else to say about this because i already uh said what
[3230.84 → 3236.76] I thought it was going to be and I was that wasn't quite right I didn't realize that it would uh use like
[3236.76 → 3244.68] you know your device to create the like a history of you and then kind of file you into a neat tidy
[3244.68 → 3252.12] little group but I mean that's fundamentally pretty much what google was using the individual information for
[3252.12 → 3259.00] anyway so it's not a huge paradigm shift like Luke said all this really does is increase the barrier to entry
[3259.00 → 3268.12] so that other providers who want to deliver context appropriate ads are going to have to use Google's service here
[3269.64 → 3278.12] that's uh wow good job wow that is uh that is incredible so google is a privacy company in the sense that
[3278.12 → 3283.88] they want to make sure that your data is private from everybody but google they want to make sure that
[3283.88 → 3290.28] all the money is privately theirs I like it, I like it thanks google they're publicly traded company yeah
[3290.28 → 3298.60] thanks google you are truly a benevolent overlord please yes bless upon me with your blessings
[3298.60 → 3308.60] speaking of blessings LTT store a new t-shirt oh yeah so this is a really cool shirt it actually looks
[3308.60 → 3315.48] awesome it's kind of uh it's kind of a new what yeah yeah I didn't realize you were wearing it yeah
[3315.48 → 3322.76] it's kind of a new CPU design but what's really special about it is we've been playing around with the
[3322.76 → 3329.96] uh like the reflective dyes that we've used to do some of our uh really shiny products and mixing them
[3329.96 → 3336.68] in with regular dyes so this one right here oh no this is not that this is a different thing uh
[3337.96 → 3347.32] wait what uh nothing carry on so uh what we're doing is we are mixing a not a shiny uh thing so this is
[3347.32 → 3354.60] actually a reflective dye so what happens is because I'm using a really soft light right now you can't
[3354.60 → 3363.24] really see it but under an UV light or under a very bright light this will actually kind of glow like a
[3363.24 → 3372.44] like a reflector on your bicycle helmet uh or like a reflective strip so both the CPU and the LTT on the
[3372.44 → 3377.24] back are this kind of like cool reflective material so if you're in the dark and like a light shines
[3377.24 → 3383.72] that it'll kind of like it'll kind of glow um on your chest if you're into that sort of thing
[3383.72 → 3391.96] so that's available over on LTT store right now uh so go ahead and buy one and make sure that you set
[3391.96 → 3399.48] it up to save your information um so that next time you need to use LTT store it'll be really fast to go
[3399.48 → 3416.92] through the checkout okay um to do is that sort of it no I want to talk about the 6700 XT being
[3416.92 → 3423.56] a paper launch where's this I remember reading that reading about that where is this there it is uh are
[3423.56 → 3432.84] you surprised no in fact the first frame of our video is Anthony literally launching paper at my
[3432.84 → 3440.92] head oh I saw that right yeah so no we were pretty sure that was going to happen but amd has
[3440.92 → 3448.04] not learned anything uh from their long history of over promising and under delivering uh this is a quote
[3448.04 → 3455.48] with the AMD Radeon Rx 6700 XT launch we are on track to have significantly more GPUs available for
[3455.48 → 3461.80] sale at launch we know it's crazy out there, but we're doing everything we can why not just say
[3462.44 → 3470.12] it's going to be impossible to get one like i I don't know uh uh uh yeah they said before that the
[3470.12 → 3475.64] Rx 6000 series would not be a paper launch uh they've all sold out like basically instantly frank
[3475.64 → 3482.12] Azor famously tweeted I look forward to taking your ten dollars when another user tweeted ten
[3482.12 → 3489.56] dollars says AMD will be a paper launch too now what's uh really not going to help or maybe make
[3489.56 → 3495.56] no difference at all is that the mining capabilities of these cards will not be limited unlike the RTX 360
[3495.56 → 3501.24] from NVIDIA so you'll be fighting with scalpers and miners to obtain a card per usual if you do manage
[3501.24 → 3504.92] to get one you could theoretically mine on it to make some of your money back over time we're actually
[3504.92 → 3510.92] going to have a video about how to set up nice hash um which is a really easy to use mining software
[3510.92 → 3517.08] to be clear I'm not I'm not telling people go out there and become a commercial miner you know set up
[3517.08 → 3523.96] you know 10 rigs of 10 GPUs and suck up all the GPUs I'm talking about gamers who happen to have a card
[3523.96 → 3529.88] subsidizing their gaming hobby with some light mining I'm particularly feeling guilt-free about
[3529.88 → 3534.52] recommending it right now because at least in my part of the world it happens to still be winter
[3534.52 → 3540.92] and so I'm not gonna lie at the office some of our powerful workstations are set up to mine when
[3540.92 → 3546.68] they're idle because we have to heat the building anyway so like it might as well be making money
[3546.68 → 3550.92] rather than costing money like I'm not I'm not going to apologize for that we don't have any specific
[3550.92 → 3556.52] mining rigs set up, but we definitely do have some rigs that are mining and so like if you're a gamer
[3557.64 → 3563.56] why not you got to heat your house anyway you got the GPU anyway what the hey uh especially it's
[3563.56 → 3570.20] all it's all about if your house is actually cold because then my house is my I shouldn't say house
[3570.20 → 3575.88] I don't have a house my place is incredibly hot all the time because I think both my neighbours just
[3575.88 → 3582.44] crank it so it's like I'm like I'm sweating right now so that's not really an option for me yeah well
[3582.44 → 3587.64] at any rate if you are not actually just wasting electricity for no reason, and you'd have to heat up
[3587.64 → 3593.56] your place anyway i I see it as a win-win um and right so what's great about that is that even
[3593.56 → 3598.44] if you have ancient hardware you don't have to care about the power efficiency of it because
[3598.44 → 3606.28] you're just heating your house yay and oh there was one other thing that we said that we would talk
[3606.28 → 3611.24] about on the show today oh should we just at least mention that this eight-year-old became a
[3611.24 → 3619.88] professional Fortnite player what Joseph dean signed with team 33 in December last year got a 33 000
[3619.88 → 3628.76] signing bonus and a gaming pc meanwhile the game is rated peg 12 or ESB teen he's been playing
[3629.96 → 3635.72] that's not a law though no it's not yeah he was playing since he was four and first noticed by the
[3635.72 → 3645.08] esports team when he was six and a half what holy that is nuts I mean I guess it's not that crazy uh
[3645.08 → 3651.32] only two of the top 10 highest earning esports uh, uh excuse me Fortnite players are over 18.
[3651.96 → 3658.52] and the world cup in 2019 was won by then 16-year-old kyle buff history who walked away with three
[3658.52 → 3665.48] million dollars this is crazy too Joseph's mom Gigi says she only lets him play for two or three hours a
[3665.48 → 3671.72] day after school and more on weekends I mean that's like a lot, but it's not night and day like
[3671.72 → 3676.52] he's not going to school he's like you know on the professional gamer track or anything like that
[3676.52 → 3687.16] like still going to school that's uh that's kind of that's kind of crazy it is kind of crazy he plays
[3687.16 → 3693.00] piano he says playing piano helped him a lot with the keyboard he says and mouse but I mean that could
[3693.00 → 3697.72] maybe make sense yeah just I mean having good fine motor control is never a bad thing when it comes
[3697.72 → 3705.40] to operating a computer I know you can often kind of identify pianists when they type because they're
[3705.96 → 3712.60] yeah I know yeah they're often very good typists so that makes sense age prevents him from streaming on
[3712.60 → 3719.80] twitch oh man in 2019 an 11-year-old professional player was actually banned from twitch after his real
[3719.80 → 3725.48] age was discovered I remember that yeah this is crazy all right okay the last thing we wanted to
[3725.48 → 3731.96] talk about was the Arizona house bill that would require an allowance for third-party payment on app
[3731.96 → 3737.08] platforms I mean this is sort of pertinent to you, you want to run us through this one or shall i oh
[3737.08 → 3743.56] yeah sure um just before we jump into that one thing I want to mention is that some people have been
[3743.56 → 3750.36] asking about the desk pads and I have heard from nick um that apparently there will be a late March
[3750.36 → 3758.12] restock we hope anything can happen in this covid world ladies and gentlemen there's nothing we can do
[3758.12 → 3763.56] to prevent you know a container from getting stuck in the port for two or three weeks so don't hold your
[3763.56 → 3768.68] breath uh I don't want to guarantee anything but that is the most current information we have
[3768.68 → 3776.12] yeah now we're going to be talking about some American politics a lot of people know we don't
[3776.12 → 3782.12] necessarily know everything about American politics uh Arizona house advances bill requiring allowance for
[3782.12 → 3788.52] third-party payment on app platforms sounds super cool mobile software development community might be in for a big change
[3789.96 → 3797.56] in Arizona the bill Hb 2005 backed by the coalition for app fairness
[3797.56 → 3805.96] uh composed of epic match and Spotify includes an amendment that specifically prohibits stores
[3805.96 → 3812.76] exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring a developer that is uh domiciled in this state
[3813.88 → 3822.92] to use a particular in-app payment system as an exclusive mode of payments so if you have a headquarters in
[3822.92 → 3829.16] Arizona you'd be able to use another one that's so oddly specific I mean that's the way it is in the
[3829.16 → 3836.12] states though right it's basically like 52 countries many countries and then some other countries that
[3836.12 → 3843.80] don't count as countries for whatever because they're like districts or whatever little and too new or
[3843.80 → 3852.04] something who knows um well I don't think they're particularly new like uh Puerto Rico is not new oh
[3852.04 → 3858.52] right that's fair yeah um I don't follow guam is not especially new I don't think
[3861.00 → 3871.56] rough um this is all of this is even after 1898 but wow they're very not new 1898 was when Guam
[3871.56 → 3876.84] became an U.S. territory yeah sorry I will let you finish go ahead sorry they were notably newer than
[3876.84 → 3884.04] that no um, so this is after intense lobbying effects uh efforts sorry by apple against the bill
[3884.04 → 3892.20] uh the bill narrowly passed uh 31 to 29 with all but one democrat voting against and all but one republican
[3892.20 → 3905.16] voting for it um David Erin Meyer looks good to me nice uh David Erin Meyer Hansen the creator of hay
[3905.16 → 3909.88] who got in a spat with apple about this very topic back in June 2020 on Twitter you guys might remember
[3909.88 → 3913.96] that if you've been watching Sancho for a long time we talked about it uh is prepared to move his company
[3913.96 → 3921.80] to Arizona should the bill pass other developers might want to join I mean yeah happening 100 if we were
[3921.80 → 3926.52] an American developer and this was like definitely becoming a thing I would be poking Linus and being
[3926.52 → 3933.56] like hey we need to figure something out because it is actually that big of a deal um the bill still has
[3933.56 → 3940.52] to make it through the senate and not get vetoed by the governor before enshrining in the law the issue
[3940.52 → 3945.72] has spread to other states with Minnesota and potentially in Illinois uh introducing similar
[3945.72 → 3951.64] legislation so we'll have to see how this goes fascinating can I just say like kudos
[3951.64 → 3959.32] to the uh to the republicans in Arizona for pushing this forward like this is
[3960.76 → 3970.68] it's all fine and good for a marketplace to you know allow you to use it that's good, but that's not
[3971.40 → 3976.92] fair and open competition that's that's a gun to your head basically if you want to be a mobile
[3976.92 → 3984.20] developer then you're just going to have to use our store and do things our way um i absolutely
[3985.40 → 3991.80] i I'm yeah I'm I'm good I'm good this looks good it's its it's largely specific because I know some
[3991.80 → 3997.24] people are going to bring up like well you don't have to join that mark it's its largely to do with
[3997.24 → 4008.12] with the mobile space yep and how how how small and binary the mobile space is i uh i I think this
[4008.12 → 4014.44] is such a smart play from Arizona because there are a lot of ways that you can attract business to your
[4014.44 → 4020.36] city or to your county or to your state or to your country right and one of the ways that lawmakers seem
[4020.36 → 4028.04] to lean on like immediately they go straight for the tax breaks and the grants, and it's like uh
[4028.68 → 4034.84] actually there are a lot of other things that you could do to be more business friendly like just
[4035.48 → 4043.40] help businesses make money um and not just you know have them not pay any taxes so you can't build
[4043.40 → 4050.20] roads and maintain your schools and all that stuff uh ICJ says politics I'm gone it's not politics
[4050.20 → 4056.84] it's tech it just happens to be that sometimes tech gets affected by politics, and it's that's why
[4056.84 → 4065.16] politics is important it really does matter i I suspect you'll see more developers than just hey
[4065.16 → 4070.84] making that move as well I suspect some of them might wait to see what other states glom on we did
[4070.84 → 4075.08] we did mention at least two names and there might be more after that someone might hold their cards
[4075.08 → 4079.32] and wait to see if there's one a little closer to home or one that is literally their home
[4079.96 → 4085.00] but I would not be surprised if there was I would not be surprised if their at all if there was
[4085.00 → 4091.00] movement of pre-existing companies and I can pretty much guarantee that if there's a new company a very
[4091.00 → 4097.80] small one that is thinking of starting up they will strategically start somewhere 100 that might not
[4097.80 → 4102.84] be something that you hear a ton about yeah you'll, you'll hear more about companies moving you won't
[4102.84 → 4108.28] hear a ton about companies strategically starting in a specific area but I guarantee you that will happen
[4108.28 → 4114.20] drummer asks why did the democrats vote against it that's very surprising don't be surprised uh you
[4114.20 → 4119.56] know there's no political party that's actually on your team it all comes down to you know what
[4120.44 → 4125.80] gets them in office and at the end of the day if this is a small time issue that isn't making national
[4125.80 → 4136.52] news um and so there's no kind of there's no attention on if it's much easier for one side or another to end up
[4136.52 → 4145.16] being lobbied into doing something that's off-brand for them so there you have it sorry to kind of burst your
[4145.16 → 4152.84] bubble there if you are as simple enough to brand yourself as one or the other than you pretty much
[4153.48 → 4160.36] um i I don't know what to say to you, you have to analyze each issue individually you can't just
[4160.36 → 4167.48] don't fall for the branding treat political parties like companies because they are pretty much the same
[4167.48 → 4175.40] thing it doesn't matter what it is okay retailer sports team political party they're all companies
[4175.40 → 4182.68] they're all trying to sell you and market you something so try to ignore it try to just look
[4182.68 → 4188.52] at the product decide for yourself what you actually need because that's the only thing that will ever
[4188.52 → 4199.32] actually work all right I think that's pretty much oh we should probably do some uh we should
[4199.32 → 4203.32] probably do some super chats yes all right I'm going back to the beginning of the show
[4204.44 → 4209.88] uh Jackson says they announced an update to Ethereum that is expected to significantly hurt mining
[4209.88 → 4215.16] profitability, so the limiter will be irrelevant in a few months anyway I mean there's been updates to
[4215.16 → 4218.44] Ethereum that are expected to hurt mining profitability for a long time I mean the move
[4218.44 → 4222.52] to proof of stake in like what a couple of years is supposed to basically kill it for small-time miners
