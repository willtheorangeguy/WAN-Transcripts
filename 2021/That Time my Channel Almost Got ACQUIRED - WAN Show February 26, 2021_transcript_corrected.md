[0.00 → 12.02] Okay, so I walk up to Madison's desk today, and she's working on just like the weirdest sh**, okay?
[12.12 → 19.54] So there's like, there's like someone filming something through a window, and then she's filming them
[19.54 → 23.32] and like someone else is filming something, and she explains it to me and I go,
[23.32 → 33.54] okay, weird champ. And she's like, are you talking my language now? I'm like, see, I'm learning.
[33.98 → 41.14] Old dog, new trick. Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen. We've got a fantastic show for you guys today.
[41.32 → 51.02] We're going to be talking about Apple's M1 Macs, now vulnerable to at least one virus that has native code designed to run on them.
[51.02 → 69.22] That's a little oops. Also, the RTX 3060 launch in a massive shock to absolutely no one has been completely destroyed by miners and opportunistic scalpers.
[69.34 → 71.94] What else we got on the docket today, Mr. Cafetière?
[72.48 → 77.32] Someone tried to acquire Linus Media Group in the past.
[77.32 → 82.64] They did. Right near when Linus Media Group was really just starting to boil.
[82.76 → 87.44] It was just Linus. There wasn't really much of a media group yet. I mean, Luke was there. Luke was there.
[87.44 → 88.66] I was going to say, I was around.
[88.68 → 95.14] And you were there. And you were there. And you were there. Why are you in my dreams? This is weird.
[95.82 → 99.50] At that time, you were the only one on camera, I think, though, right?
[99.54 → 100.28] I believe so.
[100.78 → 101.06] Yeah.
[101.36 → 102.82] This was pretty early on.
[102.82 → 105.54] I can't believe we've never talked about this. And what else we got?
[106.80 → 110.86] Also, you know what? I don't actually want to talk about that one.
[112.70 → 115.28] I didn't want to 5950X.
[115.52 → 115.88] Yeah.
[116.40 → 116.70] Yeah.
[116.70 → 118.54] That's not really what that means.
[118.66 → 125.14] Anyway, executive order signed to review the semiconductor supply chain because, wow, there's been a lot of issues there.
[125.14 → 125.86] Because that's how that works.
[125.90 → 127.24] All right. Let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[127.24 → 128.20] Yeah.
[136.46 → 137.94] Hey, you want to know something exciting?
[138.96 → 139.18] Yeah.
[139.32 → 140.22] The intro animation.
[140.66 → 142.42] We are finally getting a new one.
[144.02 → 144.46] Really?
[144.70 → 145.02] Yeah.
[145.82 → 150.20] Ed was like, so do you guys want like a redesigned intro animation?
[150.48 → 151.54] And I was like, no.
[151.54 → 156.40] I just want some new backgrounds for the old one.
[156.50 → 159.60] And he's like, oh, OK, well, that can be arranged.
[160.42 → 162.80] So, you know how there was, you know how there were two before?
[163.26 → 165.50] And we've only used like the pyramid.
[165.80 → 166.84] Oh, no, there was the pyramid one.
[166.90 → 167.42] That's the old one.
[167.46 → 170.38] And then we've only used like the swamp one since then.
[170.54 → 172.22] So we're going to get some new ones.
[172.26 → 173.54] So I'm really excited about that.
[173.90 → 174.78] Why don't we jump right?
[174.96 → 175.82] Oh, go ahead.
[175.82 → 178.46] The pyramid one was unique, and we played it.
[178.70 → 181.84] Didn't we only play it for like a couple of weeks, and then it never came back?
[181.96 → 187.64] Well, the thing is that the idea behind these intros is that they were supposed to be super
[187.64 → 190.76] quick and easy to create so we could change them all the time.
[191.16 → 192.76] And then we did it one time.
[193.46 → 196.38] And then we were understaffed for seven years.
[196.80 → 198.78] Have we ever brought the pyramid one back?
[198.78 → 201.28] I think I used it a couple of times later on.
[201.36 → 203.74] But other than that, no, it was only it was only a handful of times.
[203.82 → 207.20] It's been swamp intro for years and years and years.
[207.92 → 209.14] Why don't we jump right in?
[209.28 → 210.42] We need mountain info.
[210.68 → 213.26] He is not going to let me jump into our headline topic.
[213.34 → 215.14] Ladies and gentlemen, you know who to blame.
[215.46 → 217.30] OK, you said you were tired.
[217.38 → 218.20] You asked me to carry the show.
[218.26 → 219.02] I'm trying to talk more.
[219.10 → 222.16] For the first time ever, Luke has interrupted me on the show.
[222.16 → 228.04] I was leaving a currently thematic Manheim reference for the gamers watching the stream.
[228.04 → 229.48] OK, this will not stand.
[229.82 → 231.62] So I said mountain theme.
[231.72 → 233.20] We're moving through the biomes.
[233.46 → 234.20] Come on, Linus.
[234.42 → 235.46] I got nothing.
[235.70 → 237.16] It's a survival game, right?
[238.04 → 238.56] Yeah.
[238.82 → 239.14] Excellent.
[240.18 → 240.82] All right.
[240.82 → 242.06] So it's story time.
[242.80 → 246.32] And Luke was with Linus Media Group at the time.
[246.32 → 252.50] But this was only shortly after we had split off from NCI and formed our own company.
[252.64 → 256.16] Now, you guys might not know this because they're not very big.
[256.16 → 264.60] But there are actually some other technology channels in the let's say, the geographical area.
[265.20 → 274.88] OK, so there was a time when, you know, I was kind of looking for some mentorship in terms of how do you start a media company?
[274.88 → 281.58] Because while I knew, you know, RAM timings and, you know, fraps, right?
[281.90 → 285.88] I didn't know a lot about actual media productions.
[286.42 → 290.84] And some of those some of those productions have been going since the TV days.
[290.84 → 296.06] So I remember having a perfect meeting with Steve Motto from Motto Tech.
[296.54 → 303.20] Like if you followed tech in the 90s, he was like on TV and stuff and, you know, like kind of an influential figure.
[303.96 → 306.68] And he was like extremely helpful.
[306.94 → 310.96] He was like, yeah, you know, back in the day, we did all kinds of crazy stuff.
[310.96 → 320.90] If I'm correct, and I think I am, we like pioneered how to film CRTs without the scan lines going up and down so that it was actually led to walls.
[321.04 → 322.14] Like, no way.
[322.60 → 324.64] Like, that is so cool.
[325.24 → 327.50] So anyway, you know, I had perfect meeting with him.
[327.58 → 337.18] I had some good meetings with other more experienced people trying to learn what I could about running an actual, you know, technology video production business.
[337.18 → 349.30] As opposed to just having a YouTube channel and like, you know, my bro ski here and Ed and like winging it, you know, you know, how do you get how do you get real sponsorships?
[349.36 → 353.54] How do you engage with these big like multinational companies like our first year?
[353.90 → 357.30] Yes, their contracts because you think you didn't do a good enough job.
[357.62 → 359.70] That's how you that's how you make it.
[359.74 → 360.64] Yeah, exactly.
[360.64 → 369.88] I mean, Luke, do you remember our first CES when we would walk up to a booth of like, you know, a Samsung or an LG or something like that?
[370.78 → 376.52] And they're just like, yeah, exactly station here.
[376.62 → 377.92] We're going to bump you out of the way.
[378.32 → 379.00] Yeah, exactly.
[379.18 → 380.82] TV is the future, you know.
[381.32 → 382.54] See you later, YouTuber.
[382.54 → 386.14] So, so anyway, I was trying to I was trying to learn this stuff.
[386.26 → 390.48] And I ended up having like a few meetings with a company.
[390.84 → 397.72] Well, the owner owners of a company that has been in the tech video space for quite some time.
[398.38 → 407.50] And they had sort of like, after meeting with me a couple of times, they kind of went, hey, look, you know, we want you to meet our other partners.
[407.50 → 425.26] Because we think that there are a lot of like synergies here, we can teach you a lot about, you know, applying for production services, tax credits, how to do the accounting for like a media production, like you can save a lot of money.
[425.26 → 435.12] And you can have a lot of production values and sustain a lot of staff and facilities on really like a shoestring budget if you optimize a lot of these things.
[435.12 → 439.80] And, you know, we really think that you've got a lot of energy.
[440.46 → 443.56] And, you know, so, yeah, we want to we want to talk about that.
[444.66 → 449.74] So we end up kind of sitting down and meeting about it.
[449.74 → 467.48] And it slowly starts to dawn on me that while I had in my mind that maybe I would kind of come in and, you know, advise them on sort of, you know, how to stand out on YouTube.
[467.48 → 477.08] And they would kind of share some knowledge with me about, you know, how to structure my company, for example, like that's something that's really important in film.
[477.18 → 489.72] We've missed out on thousands and thousands of dollars because of like improper, not even improper, just like not structuring it in exactly the specific, optimal, stupid way.
[489.72 → 496.20] Because why would we think to do that? Why don't we just do our jobs, and why don't you just do your job? And then everybody's happy.
[496.60 → 504.96] I mean, I could go off on a whole other rant about Cargo at some point later on in this show if you guys want to hear about it.
[504.98 → 508.90] But I am like super unimpressed with how my tax dollars are hard at work right now.
[509.24 → 514.88] We've got VERB payments that they're just like, yeah, so if you fraudulently applied for it, you just go ahead and keep that.
[514.88 → 525.60] And then we've got legitimate Canadian productions applying for legitimate Canadian production services tax credits that are basically just not having their applications looked at for 10 months.
[525.60 → 531.54] And then after 10 months coming back and saying, yeah, well, you didn't qualify because X.
[531.58 → 535.58] And I'm like, yeah, actually, we have X. So you guys kind of need to look at this again.
[535.86 → 538.24] And they're like, oh.
[541.80 → 542.94] No further response.
[542.94 → 543.92] No further response.
[544.02 → 545.54] It's unbelievable.
[545.86 → 546.38] Anyway, okay.
[546.82 → 549.96] So I think we're just having, we're like bros, right?
[550.00 → 553.58] We're just like having this conversation about how I can help you, how you can help me.
[553.98 → 563.22] And all of a sudden they start talking about like, so, you know, what we really want to do is we want to bring you on as like the host of our show.
[563.40 → 566.08] And I'm like, oh, that's interesting.
[566.08 → 573.10] So I would, so you guys would like to contract me to come in, to come and be on the show.
[573.12 → 580.82] And they're like, no, no, we, it would be more like, you know, it'd be more like, like, like combining the companies.
[580.82 → 583.44] And I was like, oh, okay.
[583.44 → 586.20] Well, now, you know, that's actually maybe interesting.
[586.46 → 588.74] You know, I didn't think I'd be this early in my career.
[588.74 → 591.66] And I'm already having like, you know, an M&A meeting.
[591.66 → 592.60] Like, wow.
[592.60 → 592.72] Wow.
[593.52 → 596.76] I must, you know, I must really be like, you know, kind of crushing it here.
[596.76 → 598.88] Cause these guys seem like, you know, big shots.
[598.88 → 601.06] Like they've been doing this a long time, like really experienced.
[601.42 → 603.12] And I have a lot of respect for them, actually.
[604.00 → 604.40] Anyway.
[605.32 → 610.50] So I kind of sit down and I, and I think about it and I, oh, you know, it'd be hilarious.
[612.22 → 617.92] I bet I could even find, I bet I could even find like old emails about this.
[617.98 → 619.56] Let's see if I can track anything down.
[619.56 → 620.56] Okay.
[624.66 → 626.32] Nice to meet you.
[626.66 → 628.36] I haven't been reading it the whole time.
[628.64 → 629.08] Oh, this is.
[629.08 → 629.84] To be very clear.
[630.00 → 631.02] So I might've missed it.
[631.12 → 633.50] But so far I haven't seen anyone guess who it was.
[633.90 → 634.20] Yeah.
[634.26 → 636.84] No, I don't think they'll, I don't think they'll be able to.
[637.02 → 637.90] So, okay.
[638.00 → 638.38] Okay.
[638.38 → 647.10] There was a whole thing where they like were talking to me on like, uh, like, uh, a budget with a local, uh, ISP.
[647.24 → 649.42] And like, we were working on some deals together.
[649.56 → 652.52] That was a whole, that was a whole other thing.
[653.48 → 657.34] Uh, oh, this is hilarious.
[658.12 → 659.92] I, oh man, man.
[659.94 → 661.38] There was like this whole thing.
[661.54 → 663.12] And I sent them back an email.
[663.20 → 664.64] I'm like, there are two issues with this deal.
[664.72 → 667.84] One is I'd have to plaster my channel and content with this to a degree.
[667.84 → 670.64] I'm not comfortable with to get like 30,000 views per video.
[670.80 → 675.04] The second is the fact that this is spread over six videos makes it nearly impossible.
[675.28 → 679.18] If my job was to drive one video to 30,000 views, I could do it.
[679.26 → 681.50] But I'm still in channel growth mode to a great extent.
[681.58 → 685.50] I feel like pushing something this aggressively will hurt it in a way that's just not worth it to me right now.
[685.50 → 687.00] This is so funny.
[687.14 → 692.10] It's like business me like seven, eight years ago.
[692.58 → 693.48] Oh man.
[693.58 → 694.82] I absolutely love it.
[694.86 → 698.50] Anyway, the point is we get down to it.
[698.50 → 711.42] And the thing about merger and acquisition MNA discussions is that a lot of the time the parties don't necessarily see eye to eye on who's merging and who's acquiring.
[713.04 → 723.64] So while they were a much larger company than mine, it was just me, Luke, and we might have had Brandon on board by that point.
[723.64 → 728.66] But it was basically me, Luke, Ed, and maybe Brandon by this point in time.
[728.82 → 732.70] So we were a very small company, like half or one third of the staff.
[733.14 → 740.02] But in terms of who was actually like growing, as far as I could tell by every external metric, it was us.
[740.50 → 744.12] And if the last eight years or anything to go by, I was correct.
[744.24 → 746.34] We were the ones that were on the growth trajectory.
[746.34 → 757.90] So it was my understanding that this would be more like a merger of equals or like, you know, like a strategic merger, bringing in this experience and knowledge.
[758.64 → 762.38] And, you know, Linus Tech Tips was really like going to be the show.
[762.38 → 770.36] And then it was their understanding that Linus Tech Tips was kind of like some kitschy YouTube thing.
[770.56 → 776.72] And I was going to come in, and I was going to be the host of their show and basically like work there.
[776.82 → 779.08] Like this was more of like an acquisition thing.
[780.02 → 790.24] And basically, as soon as I figured that out, it was the conversation was pretty much over.
[790.24 → 795.68] We exchanged some pleasantries over the years.
[796.50 → 797.94] This is so great.
[798.42 → 801.06] I sent this email in November 2013.
[801.62 → 805.00] We're pretty particular about what we're willing to do to promote paid videos to our audience.
[805.36 → 815.88] One thing is behind the scenes, but that's generally only included with projects that cost approximately three thousand dollars and rely heavily on there being something genuinely interesting about the BTS content.
[816.72 → 817.68] I love it.
[818.12 → 819.36] Business Linus.
[820.24 → 825.16] So that's the only time.
[825.32 → 830.96] Actually, no, that's not the only time anyone's tried to buy Linus Tech Tips or Linus Media Group.
[831.46 → 842.08] So anyway, long story short, they thought that I was pretty much going to give them my company in exchange for their expertise to help grow my company, which would now be their company.
[842.08 → 844.92] And I was like, that's the stupidest.
[844.92 → 845.42] Stupidest for the hiring.
[846.00 → 846.48] Yeah.
[846.60 → 848.90] I was like, that's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
[849.04 → 855.74] We're not doing that because Linus Media Group is on a stellar, stellar path right now.
[855.74 → 860.42] And I could not be more glad that I have 6,900 concurrent viewers.
[860.62 → 860.92] Nice.
[860.92 → 883.62] I could not be more glad that I stayed on the path that I did continue with Linus Media Group and staying as independent as we can be because it's given me so much flexible to just do things that I think are awesome and things that I think are right without having to deal with like other directors, except my lovely wife, who really does help rein me in, actually.
[883.62 → 889.40] And I think I'm pretty sure they still exist.
[889.58 → 890.10] So that's cool.
[890.18 → 890.84] That's good for them.
[891.36 → 897.62] I get such a kick out of business, businessman Linus talking like talking numbers, talking deals.
[899.32 → 900.34] Oh, man.
[900.92 → 902.40] Estimated it's fine at this point.
[902.52 → 903.56] This is so crazy.
[904.58 → 905.62] Oh, my God.
[905.66 → 907.14] I emailed you with this.
[907.14 → 918.04] I forwarded you the like response I sent to them about how they just like clearly had no understanding whatsoever of like what was possible on the YouTube platform and how it worked.
[918.38 → 920.70] I forwarded this to you, Brandon and Ed.
[920.98 → 922.74] So apparently, yes, Brandon was with us.
[922.92 → 928.52] And the email just says why we aren't partnering with this company, the company name.
[929.10 → 930.24] I think I remember that.
[930.46 → 930.62] Yeah.
[931.52 → 932.74] Oh, that's so great.
[932.82 → 935.10] Because they just had no idea.
[935.10 → 942.06] And it's funny because a lot of the time I don't think that the knowledge that I have is particularly specialized, like how to run a YouTube channel.
[942.22 → 945.00] There's mind you, this was in this is in 2013.
[945.40 → 952.98] There wasn't quite as there weren't quite as many master classes and like, well, YouTube videos about how to run a successful YouTube channel.
[953.04 → 954.30] Nowadays, you just go on spiffing.
[955.32 → 957.68] There was actually spiffing.
[957.88 → 959.60] Yeah, I said you just go on spiffing.
[959.60 → 964.38] Brett, you just exploit the out of the algorithm and boom, you're a YouTuber, son.
[965.10 → 966.02] Exploit everything.
[966.30 → 967.24] Exploit all the things.
[967.34 → 969.32] So watch the spiffing, Britt, and then you won't be able to stop.
[970.66 → 973.82] But yeah, I remember when we were going through that.
[974.04 → 979.28] I remember there was a lot of like logical, like, okay, we don't really know what we're doing in a few different ways.
[979.36 → 979.88] These guys do.
[979.98 → 981.12] Maybe we should work with them.
[981.40 → 982.46] I remember having those discussions.
[982.46 → 984.70] But I was like very uncomfortable about the whole thing.
[984.70 → 989.88] And then I remember getting that email and be like, yeah, we can do it.
[990.44 → 993.34] They were like, they were too traditional.
[993.68 → 995.32] They're too traditional at the end of the day.
[995.96 → 999.18] And like I said, I think they're still rocking it.
[999.18 → 1001.74] They just haven't really gone on the same.
[1001.94 → 1004.02] They haven't gone on really the same growth curve that we have.
[1004.84 → 1011.12] On the subject of growth curves, let's talk a little bit about.
[1012.80 → 1013.56] I don't know.
[1013.82 → 1015.34] Something that hasn't grown enough.
[1016.10 → 1017.02] Semiconductor supply.
[1017.02 → 1017.42] Sure.
[1017.58 → 1018.24] Why don't we do that one?
[1018.58 → 1019.42] I like it.
[1019.42 → 1027.50] President Biden has signed an executive order to review semiconductors and the supply chain thereof.
[1027.96 → 1038.44] So on Monday, February 24th, this executive order was designed to address global semiconductor shortages, which kind of big deal right now.
[1038.50 → 1041.08] I mean, you can't even like make cars at the moment.
[1041.08 → 1045.32] I was going to say and has been a major topic of conversation on the LTT channel.
[1045.50 → 1048.46] Like this is not this is not foreign to you or our audience.
[1049.42 → 1050.26] Absolutely not.
[1050.36 → 1060.20] So it's affecting a lot more than just Ry zen 5000 and NVIDIA RTX 30 series and AMD's Radeon 6000 series.
[1060.34 → 1064.90] This is affecting phones, cars, large capacity batteries.
[1064.90 → 1073.94] Basically, anything that has semiconductors, anything that has a processor in it is at risk of being affected by the shortages.
[1074.22 → 1077.40] So the stems, the shortage stems from a number of things.
[1077.40 → 1080.32] So there are spikes in demand due to work from home.
[1080.42 → 1082.86] I mean, have you noticed how impossible it is to buy a webcam?
[1083.92 → 1085.90] Slowdowns in production caused by the pandemic.
[1086.48 → 1088.86] Slowdowns in shipping, just backlogs and shipping.
[1088.98 → 1097.12] I mean, we've even encountered this with like mouse pads, and they're only peripherally connected to semiconductor products.
[1097.12 → 1099.96] Get it?
[1099.96 → 1100.66] I like it.
[1100.74 → 1103.00] That actually did take me a sec, but I like it.
[1103.04 → 1103.44] That was good.
[1104.38 → 1107.96] It stems from outsourcing heavily to TSMC.
[1108.36 → 1112.00] So TSMC is basically just got a license to print money.
[1112.48 → 1117.82] The more dyes they can shove off the line, the more money they can have.
[1118.54 → 1121.90] And more and more design companies are shutting down fabs.
[1121.90 → 1123.00] Exactly.
[1123.66 → 1125.08] It's consolidating.
[1125.26 → 1125.58] Yeah, sorry.
[1125.68 → 1125.92] Keep going.
[1126.08 → 1133.26] And of course, Trump's trade war and policies with China have made it harder to work with Chinese chip manufacturers.
[1133.26 → 1139.76] So the semiconductor industry of America signed an open letter urging President Biden to act.
[1139.88 → 1147.10] Some major inclusions include Dr. Lisa Su from AMD, Tim Teeter from NVIDIA, Dr. Thomas Caulfield from Global Foundries.
[1147.46 → 1151.60] And the aim is to expand both domestic and international production.
[1151.60 → 1159.82] So the problem with this is that I don't know how much you guys know about building like a CPU or GPU fab.
[1159.82 → 1168.72] But for this executive order, assuming that, you know, everyone gets behind it, and it's go, go, go time.
[1168.72 → 1172.88] And they actually put a shovel in the soil like tomorrow.
[1172.88 → 1183.20] From that time until it actually produces like working silicon is like four to five years.
[1183.36 → 1187.88] Like you might be you might be getting a 5080 RTX 5080.
[1188.68 → 1189.30] Who knows?
[1189.38 → 1192.08] Maybe it'll be like ZTX by that point.
[1192.16 → 1193.52] They'll have changed the branding again.
[1193.58 → 1198.66] It'll be it'll be Z raster lighting, shading, whatever, whatever they come up with.
[1198.66 → 1202.48] How do you feel if it was an LTX 30 or 5080?
[1202.66 → 1203.84] An LTX.
[1204.38 → 1204.74] Hmm.
[1206.28 → 1207.06] I'll allow it.
[1207.80 → 1208.24] Okay.
[1208.50 → 1210.26] I'll allow it as long as we can give them.
[1211.04 → 1212.68] As long as you can give them away at LTX.
[1212.74 → 1213.34] Yeah, exactly.
[1213.58 → 1214.20] Then I'm down.
[1214.52 → 1215.02] Then I'm down.
[1215.34 → 1216.72] There's no way NVIDIA would do that.
[1216.82 → 1221.58] I think NVIDIA and I are not the greatest of friends right now.
[1222.10 → 1225.54] I think we're a little frosty at the moment.
[1225.84 → 1226.62] You know what I mean?
[1227.22 → 1227.80] I think so.
[1227.80 → 1229.30] We all went to Wendy's.
[1229.44 → 1229.68] Okay.
[1229.80 → 1235.84] We got a frozen treat, and we're just we're waiting for we drank them too fast.
[1235.98 → 1238.52] Our our our chest got a little cold.
[1238.64 → 1240.14] We're waiting for the hearts to thaw.
[1240.38 → 1242.94] You know, we got to we got to kiss and make up.
[1245.28 → 1246.36] I like that video.
[1246.52 → 1247.58] If you haven't watched it yet.
[1247.76 → 1248.52] Fantastic video.
[1248.64 → 1249.38] Don't remember what it's called.
[1249.46 → 1252.22] Something along the lines of like NVIDIA is not your friend or something.
[1252.52 → 1252.78] Yeah.
[1252.84 → 1254.74] NVIDIA pretends to care about gamers.
[1254.74 → 1259.94] I mean, I don't want to I don't want to get into it a bunch.
[1260.48 → 1266.08] It's just that like I think a lot of people the like dislike ratio is perfect.
[1266.16 → 1267.82] So I think most people got it.
[1267.82 → 1276.38] But my problem is that it's always hard to read the comments on something like that because of the people who didn't understand the video.
[1276.38 → 1286.80] It seems like 80 percent of the comments are those people who just did not understand the point that we were making.
[1286.80 → 1289.14] Like there's a lot of people that are like, yeah, duh.
[1289.30 → 1290.56] Corporations aren't your friends.
[1290.74 → 1291.10] Duh.
[1291.46 → 1291.86] Duh.
[1294.20 → 1294.76] Yeah.
[1295.04 → 1296.16] You know, what do you like?
[1296.20 → 1296.72] What do you want?
[1296.76 → 1300.52] You want a gold star for fundamentally understanding capitalism?
[1300.52 → 1302.84] That wasn't the point of the video.
[1302.94 → 1306.98] That was just one of the that was one of the themes of the video.
[1306.98 → 1308.66] That was just part of the message.
[1308.78 → 1315.68] The problem is not that a corporation cares more about money than about people.
[1316.90 → 1317.38] Right.
[1317.58 → 1317.90] Duh.
[1317.98 → 1318.44] Of course.
[1318.50 → 1320.28] I wouldn't even bother to make that video.
[1320.28 → 1330.52] The reason we made the video was because the way it was being messaged by NVIDIA was disingenuous, in my opinion.
[1330.96 → 1335.90] The way that they were claiming that this was about doing gamers a favour.
[1336.48 → 1338.50] That was what we had to debunk.
[1338.70 → 1346.42] If they hadn't said anything, if NVIDIA had just said, yep, we like money and we're making mining cards.
[1346.82 → 1347.64] Go yourself.
[1347.64 → 1347.92] Go yourself.
[1348.68 → 1351.16] I just said, okay, I probably wouldn't have even made a video.
[1351.52 → 1352.32] No, probably not.
[1352.38 → 1356.06] Because it's, oh, we have a new GPU, or we have, yeah, we have a new GPU launch.
[1356.28 → 1358.16] It doesn't interest almost any of you.
[1358.64 → 1359.02] Sounds good.
[1359.30 → 1359.74] See you later.
[1360.00 → 1360.36] Exactly.
[1360.66 → 1361.80] It's not very newsworthy.
[1362.28 → 1362.68] Exactly.
[1363.18 → 1370.36] So it's one of those things where people just like, there's, there were a lot of comments that were like, yeah, it's rich.
[1370.88 → 1374.92] Criticizing NVIDIA for wanting to make money while also including a sponsor.
[1374.92 → 1378.84] You know, this video would have really come across a lot better without a sponsor.
[1379.74 → 1381.50] It has nothing to do with making money.
[1382.18 → 1391.12] I have never, I have never been anything but upfront with you guys that Linus Media Group Incorporated is a corporation.
[1391.12 → 1393.64] corporation, quite literally a corporation.
[1393.64 → 1400.44] And yes, I love what I do, and I'm passionate about what I do because if I wasn't, honestly, I've talked about this.
[1400.60 → 1402.14] I don't really have to do it anymore.
[1402.38 → 1405.24] I could go flip burgers and live comfortably.
[1405.24 → 1406.94] That would be fine.
[1407.22 → 1410.10] But I continue to do it because A, I love it.
[1410.34 → 1412.58] B, I love the people that I work with.
[1412.82 → 1414.44] And C, I love you guys.
[1414.70 → 1415.34] Not literally.
[1415.66 → 1417.44] I have no idea who most of you are.
[1417.52 → 1422.94] And honestly, I hate it when celebrities stand up on stage and go, I love you all so much.
[1422.94 → 1428.34] It's pathetic.
[1428.60 → 1430.16] Like, don't, just stop.
[1430.28 → 1435.00] The second they walk off the stage, and you're not looking at them, the tears are gone.
[1435.12 → 1435.76] They're composed.
[1436.04 → 1436.74] It's all good.
[1436.82 → 1437.58] It's all a show.
[1437.98 → 1441.56] So what I love is the community as a whole.
[1441.66 → 1442.60] Not you individually.
[1442.80 → 1443.34] I'm sorry.
[1443.42 → 1444.56] It's just not like that.
[1444.56 → 1449.76] But as a whole, I love just being surrounded by tech and tech-minded people.
[1449.86 → 1451.62] So that's why I do it.
[1452.06 → 1454.20] But yes, also, I have to make money.
[1454.28 → 1457.48] If I'm going to be here, then I got a lot of salaries to pay.
[1457.56 → 1458.84] I don't know if you guys have paid attention.
[1458.96 → 1460.16] You go on LinusMediaGroup.com.
[1460.22 → 1462.52] There's like 40 people on that website.
[1462.68 → 1464.16] That doesn't even include Flow plane.
[1464.32 → 1468.06] That doesn't include the like half a dozen people that are on probation right now.
[1468.42 → 1469.64] We got a lot of mouths to feed.
[1469.64 → 1471.14] I'm not going to apologize for that.
[1471.20 → 1473.62] The difference is that's exactly it.
[1473.62 → 1480.34] I am unapologetically demonstrating to you guys how I make my money.
[1480.50 → 1481.82] I'm being transparent.
[1482.74 → 1484.12] NVIDIA is coming out saying,
[1485.06 → 1492.00] We just, we created these, we created these crypto mining cards because we just, we love gamers so much.
[1492.10 → 1496.86] We just, we want gamers to be so happy that we make these crypto cards so that,
[1496.86 → 1501.80] so that those bad, bad crypto people won't get your gaming, gaming cards.
[1501.98 → 1503.18] So we'll take care of you.
[1503.62 → 1505.32] It has nothing to do with that.
[1505.42 → 1509.24] It has everything to do with destroying the secondhand market for these crypto cards.
[1511.06 → 1517.50] So, anyway, I, I, you know, after reading some of the comments, I have to admit, I had some doubts.
[1517.50 → 1524.12] So I did what I usually do, which is done my research on the topic after I've already published my hot take.
[1525.12 → 1529.32] And honestly, talking to some, I'm not going to name names.
[1529.40 → 1532.74] They were, they were not willing to go on the record.
[1533.12 → 1537.92] But after talking to some savvy people, I basically went, look, did you watch it?
[1537.92 → 1539.00] They're like, oh yeah, I watched it.
[1539.00 → 1541.92] And I'm like, do you think I got it wrong?
[1542.30 → 1543.76] They're like, nah.
[1545.18 → 1545.94] Like, okay.
[1546.32 → 1553.66] The one thing that we didn't know at the time was that it looks like at least a couple of the cards are going to be based on Turing rather than Ampere.
[1553.66 → 1558.56] What that means is that they won't affect supply of Ampere.
[1558.68 → 1563.64] But what we also suspect at this time is that a couple of them will be based on Ampere.
[1563.88 → 1569.58] What we also know is that in spite of the messaging around, you know, making sure that, you know,
[1570.22 → 1574.84] nerfing the crypto mining capabilities of the 3060 to make sure that it gets in the hand of gamers,
[1575.36 → 1577.04] it wasn't effective.
[1577.18 → 1578.26] I mean, it didn't do anything.
[1578.26 → 1584.36] We already saw crypto farms running like hordes of 3060s before the card, before we had a card,
[1584.56 → 1587.18] before we could even start working on our review of it.
[1587.64 → 1588.22] Crypto farms.
[1588.52 → 1593.04] And that stupid driver lock doesn't mean anything.
[1593.54 → 1594.68] Well, it's more than that.
[1594.92 → 1597.56] So it's driver, firmware, something else.
[1597.70 → 1598.10] It's a three.
[1598.38 → 1602.46] The point is it will be, if HDCP can be broken, this can be broken.
[1602.68 → 1608.00] There is literally no money to be made in like breaking HDCP.
[1608.00 → 1608.96] Okay, there's a little.
[1609.50 → 1613.90] But compared to the billions and billions of dollars that is the crypto industry,
[1614.44 → 1617.58] like I didn't get into any depth in this in the video.
[1617.70 → 1618.68] But okay, Luke, Luke.
[1618.78 → 1624.98] Okay, so let's say I have a billion dollars on the line and NVIDIA has issued me a challenge
[1624.98 → 1630.56] and said that their cryptocurrency mining driver lock is unbreakable.
[1630.86 → 1631.86] What do I do?
[1632.48 → 1633.22] Hit me.
[1633.38 → 1633.72] Come on.
[1634.38 → 1636.16] I just put it online for a bounty.
[1637.18 → 1637.70] Right.
[1638.70 → 1639.06] Okay.
[1639.24 → 1641.18] That was, that was, wow.
[1641.48 → 1642.60] That was so hard.
[1642.72 → 1644.40] You had to think about that for so long.
[1644.62 → 1648.88] Because like the thing is, guys, you have to, you have to remember the easiest way to hack,
[1649.14 → 1649.44] right?
[1649.96 → 1653.12] Is not to get into the get into the mainframe.
[1653.28 → 1656.40] You know, get, get, get the, get the C colon slash.
[1657.50 → 1660.04] That's not the easiest way to hack something.
[1660.04 → 1662.52] The easiest way to hack something is social engineering.
[1662.52 → 1665.68] People, people are the weakest link.
[1665.68 → 1671.14] And if I've got a billion dollars on the line, let's say I don't have a billion dollars on
[1671.14 → 1671.30] the line.
[1671.36 → 1673.28] Let's say I have a hundred million dollars on the line.
[1673.32 → 1674.62] Who cares how much I have on the line?
[1674.70 → 1677.08] It's a big fat amount of money.
[1677.20 → 1679.06] At a certain point, it becomes basically irrelevant.
[1679.06 → 1681.40] Enough money that it doesn't matter anymore.
[1681.76 → 1682.04] Exactly.
[1682.30 → 1689.34] At a certain point, it goes, it gets to the point where it's like, I could afford literally a
[1689.34 → 1695.36] $5 million bounty to some NVIDIA employee to leak me this driver.
[1695.36 → 1705.08] And the cold hard truth is that a company the size of NVIDIA never has like one keyholder.
[1705.82 → 1706.10] Okay.
[1706.32 → 1708.00] For like, uh, what's up, Luke?
[1708.40 → 1709.68] People talking about hacking the Gibson?
[1710.36 → 1712.58] People are Memling C colon slash.
[1715.58 → 1716.68] I'm hacking.
[1719.64 → 1721.08] Sorry, that's fantastic.
[1721.08 → 1727.80] So, so the point is like at a certain point, you just go straight to the engineers that
[1727.80 → 1729.98] are working on this project and don't kid yourself.
[1730.18 → 1735.10] The crypto community is extremely well-connected in the industry.
[1735.68 → 1735.96] Why?
[1736.48 → 1737.86] Because money.
[1739.72 → 1742.28] So you just go to who you know is working on this thing.
[1742.38 → 1745.28] You go, hey, um, okay.
[1745.28 → 1750.90] If I promise not to post this online, you, uh, can you get me the modified, uh, VGA bios
[1750.90 → 1751.90] and the driver.
[1752.08 → 1752.60] Okay, cool.
[1753.28 → 1753.56] All right.
[1753.82 → 1754.12] See ya.
[1754.88 → 1760.08] And as soon as one driver is out there, as soon as one modified bios file is out there,
[1760.12 → 1763.96] everyone's going to run around and reverse engineer all the different cards and figure
[1763.96 → 1769.16] out how to change their firmware so that the like the, the modified bios works on them.
[1769.16 → 1772.48] Like, it's like, I'm, I'm speaking Valley girl here.
[1772.48 → 1773.70] Because I'm just, I don't know.
[1773.70 → 1775.26] I, anytime.
[1775.26 → 1780.08] So engineering is, is huge and probably the easiest path to it, but you could also just
[1780.08 → 1781.56] figure it out technically as well.
[1781.68 → 1783.54] Like the they'll, they'll figure it out.
[1784.22 → 1789.48] Whatever path they choose, or they'll, they'll probably, I suspect they'll probably just try
[1789.48 → 1792.62] all of them and whichever one works first, they'll be like, cool.
[1792.76 → 1792.90] Yep.
[1792.90 → 1800.22] And because, because the crypto community is just like, so, uh, I don't know what to
[1800.22 → 1800.70] call it.
[1800.70 → 1803.22] Just like, so nerd bro swag.
[1803.58 → 1810.32] As soon as someone figures it out, there'll be screenshots everywhere and everyone's going
[1810.32 → 1811.24] to be like, Whoa.
[1811.62 → 1815.18] And then there's going to be a mad rush to see who can do it next.
[1815.18 → 1818.64] And then blog about how those guys must've done it.
[1818.64 → 1822.86] And it's going to be a whole new cycle and maybe that's in videos master plan.
[1822.96 → 1829.44] Let's come out and say it's unhackable so that we get another new cycle around the RTX
[1829.44 → 1830.18] 3060.
[1830.44 → 1833.58] That's all about how high demand is for this card.
[1833.58 → 1835.32] Because it's amazing or whatever.
[1835.32 → 1835.86] I don't know.
[1836.20 → 1839.76] But then again, I like, I like that we're saying it because it's, it's entertaining and maybe
[1839.76 → 1843.72] it'll, it'll spur a little bit more fun, but I don't, did they say it was unhackable?
[1843.72 → 1844.92] I don't think they said it was unpack.
[1845.92 → 1847.48] Uh, let me have a look here.
[1847.60 → 1847.96] Hold on.
[1848.00 → 1848.46] Hold on.
[1848.46 → 1848.94] Hold on.
[1849.02 → 1851.94] 3060 unhackable.
[1854.70 → 1857.48] Nvidia says, and this is a direct quote.
[1857.56 → 1858.92] This is from PC gamer.
[1859.42 → 1859.86] Okay.
[1860.24 → 1862.22] Uh, where's my display capture?
[1863.24 → 1867.06] It's cryptocurrency mining limiter cannot be hacked.
[1868.08 → 1877.66] So yes, Luke, they did not technically say unhackable, but I think cannot be hacked is, uh, I think that's pretty,
[1877.66 → 1878.66] pretty much close.
[1878.66 → 1880.68] That's a big fat close enough right there.
[1880.68 → 1882.40] I guess, I guess the game's on.
[1882.40 → 1895.82] The funniest thing about all of this posturing around the RTX 3060 and how the new CMP cards are just for miners, and they're going to make it better availability better for everyone else is like, why even say that?
[1895.82 → 1898.14] They knew it wasn't going to be enough.
[1898.58 → 1901.84] Like, it's not like, it's not like anybody at Nvidia is smart enough.
[1901.84 → 1907.14] Like, I guarantee you there's people working at Nvidia who mine because they just like are gamers and have a GPU.
[1907.14 → 1928.08] And if honestly, if you're a gamer, and you have a GPU, and you're not mining right now, you just honestly kind of, I don't want to say, um, it's an easy way for you to subsidize the acquisition of your graphics card that costs you basically nothing right now.
[1928.08 → 1933.44] That is unless you're in Texas, and you're paying $9,000 for your power bill or whatever.
[1934.42 → 1935.46] That's a separate thing.
[1935.46 → 1937.72] Um, that's, that's fair.
[1937.90 → 1950.56] I think, yeah, the main thing, the main people this is going to hurt is like Timmy and Sally back at home that, that pulled their, their allowance and small jobs money to like to buy a gaming computer.
[1950.56 → 1963.06] And then they wanted to try to like to make some of that money back by like doing something not super technical, like running nice hash overnight or something to, to pull off of mom and dad's power bill that they don't know about or whatever.
[1963.06 → 1967.80] And then they make a few bucks so they can buy a game or something like that's, those are the main type of people.
[1967.92 → 1969.84] This is actually going to damage not crypto.
[1970.00 → 1975.68] Cause the commercial miners, the guys that are running these gigantic mining farms, think about it for a second.
[1977.46 → 1983.76] If nerfing the RTX 3060 to half of its potential performance was enough to make them not acquire it.
[1984.44 → 1990.76] How on earth does the math work for like those RTX 30 laptops that they're running, right?
[1990.76 → 1992.78] It's not like there's nobody at Nvidia.
[1993.02 → 1994.40] That's, this was the point I was getting to.
[1994.46 → 2008.94] It's not like there's no one at Nvidia that can use like a crypto calculator and figure out that RTX 3060 at the current price of Ethereum and Bitcoin is still mono profitable, even at half of its hash rate.
[2009.36 → 2011.84] So it was never going to help.
[2011.84 → 2024.74] Also, there is so much pent-up demand for gaming cards just because I don't know if you guys noticed, but PC gaming and gaming in general has absolutely skyrocketed because everybody's been stuck indoors.
[2025.40 → 2027.74] Why, why would they, why wouldn't they just say nothing?
[2027.74 → 2037.74] So for the longest time, you know, I've seen Nvidia do things that look like kind of obvious self-owns, and I've been like, no, no, man, no, they're playing, they're playing 4d chess.
[2038.00 → 2038.30] Okay.
[2038.54 → 2040.02] There's going to be another move here.
[2040.14 → 2042.36] They're going to, they're going to be like, bam, surprise.
[2042.50 → 2045.22] And you're like, whoa, they knew this was coming all along.
[2045.66 → 2052.82] But, but, but this one, I just, you know, I don't, I don't see it because all they had to say was nothing.
[2052.82 → 2058.60] They, all they had to say was absolutely nothing.
[2058.60 → 2067.02] They could have, they could have posted something like, hey, we understand the challenges that gamers are having acquiring graphics hardware.
[2067.64 → 2070.80] We're doing our best to make as many of these as we can.
[2071.18 → 2072.70] That was all they had to say.
[2072.76 → 2081.00] They didn't have to say anything about we're going to, you know, make it so cryptocurrency miners won't find these profitable or blah, blah, blah.
[2081.00 → 2083.12] They just had to say nothing.
[2084.78 → 2085.90] And they couldn't do it.
[2086.42 → 2087.78] They couldn't just say nothing.
[2088.62 → 2089.22] This, yeah.
[2089.32 → 2093.38] Like I, I think I've been disillusioned with the Nvidia 4d chess.
[2096.02 → 2104.80] There was, there were a lot of warning signs over the years, but I think the last one that broke it for me was when they contacted, it was hardware unboxed, I believe.
[2104.86 → 2105.06] Yeah.
[2105.34 → 2105.58] Yeah.
[2105.58 → 2110.58] That email, that was just like, wow, you've lost your touch.
[2111.10 → 2114.36] Like this is, this is clearly, there's no, there's no other play here.
[2114.54 → 2117.22] You just look like idiots.
[2117.40 → 2119.10] Like there's no, I don't know.
[2119.32 → 2121.02] And this, this, this graph is this.
[2121.20 → 2121.54] Yeah.
[2121.68 → 2123.60] I mean, this GPU launch, whatever you want to call it.
[2123.72 → 2124.64] Same kind of deal.
[2124.94 → 2126.94] It just, that was, that was dumb.
[2127.12 → 2130.00] Like there's no, there's, I can't really add anything else on top of that.
[2130.00 → 2134.84] For a while on that last one with hardware unboxed, I still believed in the 4d chess Luke.
[2135.52 → 2136.82] Did I ever tell you my theory?
[2138.98 → 2143.50] I thought someone was setting up someone else to take a fall internally.
[2143.88 → 2143.96] Yeah.
[2144.28 → 2144.50] Yeah.
[2144.50 → 2152.92] I thought someone was trying to get someone else pushed out by doing something so catastrophically stupid that someone would have to get fired for it.
[2152.92 → 2163.78] Um, I was clearly wrong because to my knowledge, everyone involved in that whole fiasco is still there.
[2164.30 → 2168.00] So I, yeah, I, I clearly, I clearly got that one wrong.
[2168.10 → 2169.58] I clearly gave them too much credit.
[2169.92 → 2174.82] Um, but Hey, maybe, maybe it's all gonna, maybe it's all going to play out.
[2174.84 → 2176.80] I mean, I, you know what?
[2176.82 → 2177.88] I'm still doing it, actually.
[2177.88 → 2188.46] So with the whole CMP mining card thing, like I came in, I'm like, no, this is about making sure that like the secondhand market for mining cards is utterly destroyed.
[2189.26 → 2190.82] I don't, maybe it's not.
[2190.82 → 2195.16] Maybe, maybe it's as simple.
[2195.26 → 2208.56] Maybe it really is as simple as typical computer industry trying to save 14 cents and making these GPUs without display connectors so that they can be 14 cents cheaper because miners won't use them anyway.
[2208.56 → 2221.22] Maybe it really is that simple, and they didn't even consider the environmental impact or the impact on, uh, value seeking gamers who want to get their hands on a good used card or something like that.
[2221.42 → 2222.10] Oh man.
[2222.20 → 2224.80] That was another really frustrating thing in the comments on that video.
[2224.86 → 2229.22] The number of people that were like, no gamer is going to use like an old mining card.
[2229.30 → 2229.70] You idiot.
[2230.68 → 2232.14] Where do you think they go?
[2232.14 → 2238.00] Do you think they go to like a magic mining factory in the sky?
[2238.40 → 2244.36] Like you, you think a miner just throws like a card that still works in the garbage?
[2244.52 → 2244.80] Like what?
[2245.22 → 2246.76] No offence, but are you stupid?
[2249.66 → 2255.44] I, oh man, it was, it was very, it was very hard to read some of the dumb in those comments.
[2255.44 → 2264.06] I just, I struggle with it sometimes, especially with a video like that, where I feel like, you know, we, we really did kind of lay it all out there.
[2265.08 → 2265.52] Um,
[2266.06 → 2268.80] I don't know.
[2270.00 → 2270.98] In other news,
[2271.48 → 2273.98] speaking of laying it all out there,
[2274.66 → 2275.20] Valve,
[2275.72 → 2276.12] um,
[2276.76 → 2276.98] I,
[2277.12 → 2277.68] Hold on,
[2277.74 → 2278.12] That's what,
[2278.40 → 2278.80] uh,
[2278.86 → 2279.32] Oh yeah,

[2332.04 → 2335.28] The show is also brought to you today by private internet access.
[2335.50 → 2336.00] That's right,
[2336.06 → 2336.56] my friends,
[2336.56 → 2342.32] PIA is the VPN that masks your IP and encrypts traffic to and from your devices.
[2342.48 → 2346.68] PIA offers reliable service and has no bandwidth caps.
[2346.84 → 2348.42] You filthy pirates,
[2348.56 → 2348.70] you.
[2349.08 → 2354.60] And it has configurable encryption and an internet kill switch to keep you in control of your connection.
[2354.60 → 2357.36] When combined with private browsing best practices,
[2357.72 → 2360.68] PIA can make websites and services think you're in a different country.
[2360.96 → 2364.10] And they have extremely generous usage policies,
[2364.20 → 2367.44] allowing 10 devices connected to a single account at once,
[2367.56 → 2368.74] with clients for Windows,
[2368.88 → 2369.26] macOS,
[2369.44 → 2369.70] Android,
[2369.80 → 2370.06] iOS,
[2370.26 → 2371.50] and Linux.
[2372.00 → 2372.20] Wow,
[2372.20 → 2372.72] this is cool.
[2373.02 → 2378.32] They recently launched a dedicated IP option that has zero connection to your account or who you are.
[2379.08 → 2379.78] That's neat.
[2379.90 → 2386.52] Not even PIA knows that the IP address is being used by you, and you just get a smoother experience with the same privacy and security.
[2386.60 → 2387.74] Because a lot of the time,
[2387.78 → 2389.26] if your IP is like changing around,
[2389.34 → 2390.24] every time you go on a website,
[2390.36 → 2391.56] you can get that cloud flare.
[2392.06 → 2392.28] Like,
[2392.32 → 2392.46] hey,
[2392.50 → 2395.76] give us five seconds to ensure that you're not a horrible bot or whatever.
[2396.16 → 2397.06] So that's pretty sweet.
[2397.60 → 2399.82] They've got 24,000 servers in 77 countries,
[2399.82 → 2404.76] and you can try it risk-free with their 30-day money-back guarantee at leg.GG slash Pagan.
[2405.32 → 2405.72] Finally,
[2405.92 → 2407.60] the show is brought to you by Sea Sonic.
[2408.04 → 2408.74] That's right.
[2409.16 → 2410.14] Ocean noise.
[2414.28 → 2414.68] No,
[2414.80 → 2414.96] no,
[2415.02 → 2415.54] but seriously,
[2415.68 → 2417.16] their power supplies are very quiet.
[2417.30 → 2417.50] You know,
[2417.74 → 2418.90] all you hear is like a
[2419.16 → 2424.68] it doesn't really sound like that.
[2424.76 → 2425.46] It's just a fan.
[2425.56 → 2425.78] Wow.
[2426.26 → 2427.98] There's maybe a problem with your power supply.
[2427.98 → 2430.86] They offer up to 80 plus titanium efficiency,
[2431.46 → 2433.36] whatever that means.
[2433.72 → 2435.52] Lambda noise level A++,
[2435.80 → 2436.44] whatever that means,
[2436.54 → 2438.72] which is that the noise output stays below 20 decibels,
[2438.84 → 2439.04] apparently.
[2439.50 → 2441.08] Fluid dynamic fan bearings,
[2441.44 → 2442.16] that I know.
[2442.30 → 2442.66] They've got,
[2442.80 → 2445.14] they've definitely got power supplies with those super,
[2445.28 → 2447.08] super efficient and quiet fan bearings.
[2447.52 → 2448.70] Premium hybrid fan control,
[2448.80 → 2452.28] which allows you to disable the fan when the power supply is only lightly loaded.
[2452.78 → 2453.72] Micro tolerance,
[2453.82 → 2454.52] low regulation,
[2454.52 → 2458.30] and up to 12 year warranties on their units.
[2458.30 → 2458.88] That's right.
[2458.88 → 2461.46] Your power supply will live longer than your bird.
[2461.56 → 2462.04] Too soon.
[2462.26 → 2462.58] Oh,
[2462.74 → 2463.06] wow.
[2463.12 → 2464.32] I can't believe I just said that.
[2464.64 → 2467.60] Check it out on Sea Sonic's website or on Amazon at the link below.
[2467.68 → 2468.06] I'm sorry,
[2468.18 → 2468.30] Luke.
[2468.34 → 2470.10] That was an absolutely low blow,
[2470.66 → 2472.22] but it ripped to Kids.
[2472.22 → 2475.58] I loved him like the feathered son I never had.
[2477.14 → 2478.64] For those of you who don't know,
[2478.80 → 2480.86] poor Luke actually lost one of his birds.
[2481.36 → 2486.90] And I realized that I've been making that joke about Sea Sonic's warranty lasting longer than your dog.
[2487.10 → 2488.26] And that's probably,
[2488.48 → 2488.92] you know,
[2488.94 → 2490.94] not a considerate joke because,
[2491.16 → 2491.30] you know,
[2491.34 → 2492.02] for all I know,
[2492.06 → 2494.26] some of you out there have recently lost a dog.
[2494.36 → 2494.96] And I thought,
[2495.04 → 2495.14] well,
[2495.16 → 2495.54] you know what,
[2495.56 → 2496.68] if I'm going to take these shots,
[2496.70 → 2498.68] I should at least take it at someone who's a friend.
[2498.68 → 2499.86] And then I was like,
[2499.94 → 2500.30] actually,
[2500.36 → 2501.28] it's probably too soon,
[2501.36 → 2502.74] but the words were already out of my mouth.
[2502.82 → 2503.46] So I'm very sorry,
[2503.56 → 2503.74] Luke.
[2505.02 → 2505.64] It's okay.
[2505.84 → 2507.16] I miss old bird.
[2507.54 → 2509.78] I feel like a lot of people have lost pets.
[2510.22 → 2511.34] I'm not the only one.
[2511.38 → 2512.90] And that's not the only pet I've lost.
[2513.38 → 2513.74] Yeah.
[2514.16 → 2514.40] Hey,
[2514.52 → 2516.70] have you introduced us to new bird yet?
[2516.76 → 2517.90] Like formally on the show?
[2518.52 → 2518.88] No.
[2519.26 → 2520.40] Why don't we meet Luke's bird?
[2521.84 → 2522.20] Okay.
[2523.70 → 2524.24] Hold on.
[2524.30 → 2524.82] How do I do this?
[2524.84 → 2525.42] Give me one second.
[2525.56 → 2526.18] Rip bird,
[2526.28 → 2527.00] long live bird.
[2527.00 → 2527.18] Okay,
[2527.22 → 2527.52] that's fine.
[2527.56 → 2528.58] I'll just do a topic while you're gone.
[2528.58 → 2528.96] No problem.
[2529.56 → 2529.80] Nope.
[2529.98 → 2531.30] He's literally right here.
[2531.40 → 2531.60] Oh,
[2531.76 → 2532.04] sick.
[2532.30 → 2532.72] Here we go.
[2532.80 → 2532.98] Wait,
[2533.64 → 2535.02] he's not in your pants,
[2535.10 → 2535.34] is he?
[2536.32 → 2536.60] No.
[2537.02 → 2538.50] You don't keep your bird in your pants,
[2538.56 → 2538.86] do you?
[2539.92 → 2540.22] Nope.
[2540.38 → 2541.08] Cause that's like,
[2541.24 → 2542.68] that's some weird right there.
[2545.24 → 2546.04] Do you see him?
[2546.34 → 2546.66] Uh,
[2546.66 → 2547.02] no.
[2548.10 → 2548.26] Oh,
[2548.32 → 2548.42] well,
[2548.50 → 2550.26] you got him right behind the thing,
[2550.40 → 2550.64] Luke.
[2551.16 → 2552.20] Right behind what thing?
[2552.36 → 2552.52] The
[2552.52 → 2553.22] the white thing.
[2553.30 → 2554.16] There we go.
[2554.46 → 2554.98] Hi.
[2555.76 → 2556.74] How are you doing?
[2556.74 → 2557.46] He's thinking.
[2559.06 → 2559.46] Thinking.
[2560.08 → 2560.80] He's thinking.
[2561.88 → 2563.32] This has never happened before.
[2563.44 → 2563.98] So he's like,
[2564.04 → 2564.62] what the heck?
[2565.70 → 2566.26] He's thinking.
[2566.92 → 2567.40] Processing.
[2568.40 → 2568.80] Processing.
[2568.80 → 2570.34] I don't even know if you pick him up when he's in his cage,
[2570.38 → 2573.16] when he's either going to bed or waking up.
[2573.16 → 2573.90] So he's like,
[2574.08 → 2574.44] um,
[2574.66 → 2576.68] what do I do?
[2578.76 → 2579.24] Yeah.
[2579.50 → 2580.00] That's him.
[2580.44 → 2581.00] What's his name?
[2582.00 → 2582.40] Uh,
[2583.04 → 2583.38] scoop.
[2584.12 → 2584.60] Scoop.
[2586.00 → 2586.94] Scoop or scoop.
[2588.12 → 2588.56] Scoop.
[2588.80 → 2589.24] Scoop.
[2589.30 → 2589.56] Okay.
[2590.00 → 2590.58] There we go.
[2590.72 → 2590.78] I,
[2590.94 → 2593.04] Luke had already told me new Bird's name,
[2593.12 → 2593.66] but I forgot.
[2593.86 → 2597.54] So I used him introducing the bird to you guys as an excuse to hear the name again.
[2598.22 → 2598.66] Strategic.
[2598.90 → 2599.22] Highly.
[2599.34 → 2599.96] I know,
[2599.96 → 2601.08] but then I admitted it.
[2601.08 → 2602.12] So now it's too late.
[2603.44 → 2605.28] Thank you for introducing us to,
[2605.32 → 2606.12] to new Bird.
[2606.62 → 2606.86] Uh,
[2606.88 → 2607.08] yeah.
[2607.30 → 2608.00] Just to be clear,
[2608.04 → 2608.36] guys,
[2608.50 → 2608.70] Luke,
[2608.78 → 2609.68] Luke did everything.
[2609.86 → 2611.24] Luke did everything in his power.
[2611.42 → 2615.74] Luke spent far more trying to save Aquino than I would have.
[2615.86 → 2616.32] No offence,
[2616.44 → 2616.64] Luke.
[2617.00 → 2618.04] I love birds too,
[2618.08 → 2619.18] but not as much as cats.
[2619.18 → 2619.66] I'm afraid.
[2620.34 → 2620.62] Yeah.
[2620.98 → 2621.28] Yeah.
[2621.44 → 2621.64] I,
[2621.76 → 2622.12] uh,
[2622.24 → 2622.46] yeah,
[2622.46 → 2622.74] we,
[2622.94 → 2624.10] we really gave it our best shot.
[2624.18 → 2624.58] The thing is,
[2624.74 → 2625.48] he was a
[2625.48 → 2626.64] he was a pet store bird.
[2627.14 → 2627.54] Um,
[2627.90 → 2628.16] scoop.
[2628.34 → 2629.08] Scoop is not.
[2629.70 → 2630.14] Um,
[2630.14 → 2631.76] he was a pet store bird.
[2631.76 → 2637.86] And we have since done a bunch of research and found that like some pet store birds will come from,
[2637.86 → 2638.58] um,
[2638.66 → 2639.74] breeding clutches.
[2639.74 → 2640.52] They're called clutches.
[2640.88 → 2641.38] Um,
[2641.50 → 2644.78] that are for like research reasons.
[2644.78 → 2647.72] Like they might be bred to have certain problems.
[2647.72 → 2647.96] Oh,
[2648.16 → 2648.58] seriously.
[2648.58 → 2649.02] Um,
[2649.02 → 2649.22] we don't,
[2649.22 → 2649.84] we don't necessarily,
[2650.00 → 2650.76] that is a thing.
[2651.20 → 2653.14] We have no idea if our,
[2653.28 → 2656.58] if our bird Aquino was one of those or not.
[2656.82 → 2657.04] Um,
[2657.04 → 2658.46] but there's also a variety of other problems.
[2658.52 → 2660.12] He very likely had preexisting conditions.
[2660.12 → 2660.38] We,
[2660.52 → 2663.10] we brought him to a vet right when we got him as is recommended.
[2663.68 → 2665.02] And as you know,
[2665.02 → 2666.40] he went to a vet a few times.
[2666.40 → 2666.80] Yeah.
[2666.80 → 2666.92] Yeah.
[2667.92 → 2669.44] Including an emergency vet.
[2670.14 → 2670.74] Cheap.
[2670.74 → 2671.72] Yes.
[2671.96 → 2672.26] Yeah.
[2672.86 → 2673.34] Um,
[2673.36 → 2673.78] so we,
[2673.88 → 2674.00] yeah,
[2674.04 → 2674.22] we,
[2674.42 → 2675.14] we tried,
[2675.36 → 2677.04] but I know you guys tried.
[2678.30 → 2678.82] Ah,
[2678.98 → 2679.72] tech topics.
[2680.72 → 2681.12] Yeah.
[2681.76 → 2682.12] Sorry,
[2682.22 → 2682.46] Luke.
[2682.50 → 2684.46] I put you on the spot on the show today.
[2684.98 → 2685.24] Nope.
[2685.30 → 2685.80] That's okay.
[2686.00 → 2686.54] But Hey,
[2686.62 → 2687.16] at least,
[2687.16 → 2687.42] uh,
[2687.42 → 2689.04] his scoop doing well.
[2689.62 → 2690.60] Scoop's doing fine.
[2690.70 → 2690.84] Yeah.
[2690.88 → 2691.62] We did the
[2691.74 → 2692.62] we did the early,
[2692.62 → 2694.90] like bring him to the vet checkup thing.
[2695.16 → 2696.00] And he was,
[2696.12 → 2697.30] he was a little underweight.
[2697.78 → 2698.18] Um,
[2698.18 → 2701.04] so they kept him for a little bit, and they like fed him up basically.
[2701.10 → 2703.68] And they kept him around other birds because,
[2703.68 → 2706.08] and they fed him like really fatty foods.
[2706.08 → 2707.70] So he'd kind of bulk up a little bit.
[2708.02 → 2710.66] And then ever since then he's been totally fine.
[2711.18 → 2711.58] Awesome.
[2711.68 → 2713.78] How does a bird get managed to get underway?
[2713.90 → 2715.30] What is underweight for a bird?
[2715.36 → 2715.50] I mean,
[2715.50 → 2716.28] they have to fly.
[2716.38 → 2717.28] They can't weigh that much.
[2718.06 → 2718.46] Yeah.
[2719.60 → 2720.78] They already weigh like nothing.
[2720.78 → 2722.30] Like when we first had to Kids,
[2722.44 → 2723.14] he loved my,
[2723.22 → 2723.78] my keyboard,
[2723.90 → 2724.66] this bird so far,
[2724.72 → 2725.98] not interested in the keyboard at all,
[2726.08 → 2727.66] but to Kids used to love my keyboard.
[2727.86 → 2731.60] So he'd like to walk around on the keys, and he could put all of his weight on
[2731.60 → 2733.38] one of the keys, and it wouldn't press it down.
[2733.58 → 2733.84] Yeah,
[2734.16 → 2734.48] exactly.
[2734.58 → 2736.38] So they weigh like very little,
[2736.68 → 2737.34] but apparently,
[2737.84 → 2738.24] uh,
[2738.88 → 2739.40] scoop was,
[2739.50 → 2740.28] was even little,
[2740.28 → 2741.34] on that metric.
[2741.34 → 2741.62] So,
[2741.62 → 2742.66] so yeah,
[2742.66 → 2743.22] but he's,
[2743.22 → 2744.06] he's gained some weight.
[2744.18 → 2744.62] He's bigger now.
[2744.82 → 2745.68] So things are good.
[2746.46 → 2748.24] Why don't we talk about how,
[2748.58 → 2749.68] for some reason,
[2750.34 → 2757.96] the Apple versus Epic app store case has now dragged valve into the fray.
[2758.68 → 2759.24] Um,
[2759.74 → 2760.80] Apple subpoenaed,
[2760.80 → 2762.24] and this was a couple of weeks ago,
[2762.24 → 2762.60] I think,
[2762.60 → 2763.08] uh,
[2763.08 → 2763.52] I think,
[2763.52 → 2764.10] uh,
[2764.10 → 2770.50] a large amount of highly sensitive private data from valve steam store to help in its defence
[2770.50 → 2773.48] against the antitrust lawsuit from Epic games,
[2773.48 → 2774.88] the request,
[2775.30 → 2777.00] which for some reason,
[2777.14 → 2778.26] the judge granted,
[2778.26 → 2780.08] have you seen this yet?
[2780.08 → 2781.08] I've,
[2781.08 → 2781.86] I've,
[2781.86 → 2782.76] I've heard about this,
[2782.84 → 2783.64] but I just assumed like,
[2783.68 → 2783.74] Oh,
[2783.74 → 2784.54] it's going to get shot down.
[2784.54 → 2786.26] The judge granted this.
[2786.44 → 2788.24] It includes historical sales,
[2788.74 → 2789.26] pricing,
[2789.26 → 2794.16] and other information on 436 games hosted on steam.
[2794.24 → 2796.90] How does this make any sense?
[2798.64 → 2805.86] Valve's lawyers argued that the judge should reject the subpoena saying the company doesn't usually produce reports like these.
[2805.86 → 2812.90] Also that the requested data is already publicly available or includes third party information that belongs to game developers anyway.
[2813.14 → 2822.42] And also they said valve is run by a small team and this would require it to dedicate multiple employees working full-time on this project.
[2822.92 → 2823.08] Okay.
[2823.08 → 2823.30] Furthermore,
[2823.30 → 2823.90] that part,
[2824.46 → 2825.66] QQ valve,
[2825.80 → 2826.72] like get over it.
[2827.08 → 2827.92] Oh my goodness.
[2827.92 → 2828.30] You know what?
[2828.34 → 2829.34] I don't even blame them.
[2829.88 → 2830.52] This is okay.
[2830.62 → 2830.78] Okay.
[2830.86 → 2831.04] Okay.
[2831.20 → 2832.12] So here's the thing.
[2832.26 → 2835.36] I don't mind spending resources on something.
[2835.36 → 2837.34] Like let's say for example,
[2837.66 → 2838.16] uh,
[2838.16 → 2839.64] Linus media group were to get audited,
[2839.76 → 2840.16] right?
[2840.64 → 2847.30] I understand that audits happen, and you're going to have to dedicate some resources to fulfilling the requirements,
[2847.30 → 2847.90] uh,
[2847.90 → 2848.62] to complete the audit.
[2848.84 → 2849.22] Sure.
[2850.30 → 2856.86] Where I get really frustrated is when stuff happens completely unnecessarily.
[2856.86 → 2861.06] So if through someone's just utter carelessness,
[2861.06 → 2867.06] they managed to do something that is like basically a guaranteed audit trigger.
[2867.50 → 2870.88] And now we have to put a bunch of resources behind it.
[2871.26 → 2875.62] Even if it was half the amount of resources of the reasonable audit,
[2875.84 → 2878.26] I am five times more angry.
[2878.26 → 2878.98] Oh yeah.
[2879.12 → 2879.74] You know what I mean?
[2879.74 → 2881.20] It's like when someone,
[2881.44 → 2885.14] my only reason why I said like QQ valve is because yeah,
[2885.14 → 2886.20] they are a small team.
[2886.26 → 2890.24] They also rake in astronomical amounts of money.
[2890.30 → 2890.38] Yeah.
[2890.38 → 2891.36] They don't need to be a small team.
[2891.52 → 2895.18] Refuse to do like almost any work ever because they're just like,
[2895.24 → 2895.92] we don't need to.
[2896.02 → 2896.64] So who cares?
[2896.78 → 2897.24] So it's like,
[2897.30 → 2897.44] Oh,
[2897.52 → 2897.80] whatever.
[2897.80 → 2899.46] You finally have to do something like,
[2899.62 → 2900.06] shut up.
[2900.12 → 2900.36] Okay.
[2900.36 → 2901.26] I don't know,
[2901.40 → 2903.06] but I do.
[2903.22 → 2906.84] If I worked at valve and I had to task the people,
[2906.96 → 2908.12] I would be pissed.
[2908.12 → 2909.70] And I think rightfully so,
[2909.78 → 2913.90] but I just don't care that that person is upset because like,
[2914.06 → 2914.40] whatever,
[2914.64 → 2915.84] like that's fine.
[2916.02 → 2919.78] It's hard for me to have a ton of sympathy for valve to be clear.
[2920.18 → 2920.66] Yeah.
[2920.82 → 2921.38] That's yeah.
[2921.62 → 2922.94] But it's a stupid situation.
[2923.18 → 2924.20] They shouldn't have to do it.
[2924.30 → 2926.28] I'm amazed that the judge approved this.
[2926.54 → 2927.64] No one should have to do this.
[2927.64 → 2930.46] I didn't even think they were super involved in this.
[2931.28 → 2931.88] It's,
[2931.94 → 2932.68] it's weird.
[2933.12 → 2933.50] It's just,
[2933.60 → 2935.96] it's just mind-blowing to me that,
[2936.12 → 2939.88] that the judge granted this because valve made an excellent point that their
[2939.88 → 2945.36] data has nothing to do with app stores and mobile games.
[2945.36 → 2949.58] And just valve has literally nothing to do with that.
[2949.72 → 2950.62] So yes,
[2950.64 → 2954.74] it is technically a marketplace where you can,
[2954.98 → 2956.02] it's a closed,
[2956.02 → 2960.96] it's a closed ecosystem and valve does have a similar model to apple.
[2961.60 → 2965.76] But I think,
[2965.76 → 2969.72] I think apple's request is overreaching at,
[2969.96 → 2970.24] at,
[2970.36 → 2971.16] at best.
[2971.32 → 2973.04] The law 360 report.
[2973.04 → 2973.72] This is great.
[2973.88 → 2976.04] Quotes judge Dickson saying to valve's council.
[2976.30 → 2979.02] It's my understanding for lack of a better word,
[2979.14 → 2981.32] apple has salted the earth with subpoenas.
[2981.32 → 2982.44] So don't worry.
[2982.60 → 2983.76] It's not just you.
[2984.86 → 2987.08] That's not really a good reason to grant.
[2987.18 → 2987.58] No,
[2987.74 → 2988.60] it's really not.
[2988.70 → 2990.38] That's a good reason to deny it.
[2990.38 → 2991.78] I think exactly.
[2992.00 → 2992.44] Exactly.
[2992.44 → 2992.72] Like,
[2992.82 → 2999.94] why are you wasting everyone's time instead of just negotiating with your
[2999.94 → 3003.58] developers in a way that everyone can agree is fair,
[3003.58 → 3005.06] or at the very least,
[3005.18 → 3006.68] everyone can agree is not fair.
[3007.32 → 3011.12] Cause right now it's whatever Apple agrees is fair and everyone else's opinion
[3011.12 → 3012.28] pretty much doesn't matter.
[3013.18 → 3013.30] Yeah.
[3013.30 → 3014.30] Fun.
[3014.30 → 3014.86] Fun.
[3015.06 → 3015.34] Um,
[3015.42 → 3015.62] just,
[3015.80 → 3016.00] you know,
[3016.06 → 3018.04] bonus fact related to this one.
[3018.22 → 3023.06] Epic is apparently attempting to locate former iOS chief Scott Forestall to
[3023.06 → 3028.02] testify after asking Apple for specific information about how to reach Forestall.
[3028.42 → 3031.68] Epic was provided a PO box and a Twitter handle,
[3032.02 → 3033.30] according to court documents.
[3035.38 → 3038.66] That's pretty much the equivalent of handing them a phone book and being like,
[3038.72 → 3039.82] you go figure it out.
[3039.82 → 3042.72] I kind of love it though.
[3042.72 → 3043.42] Actually it's,
[3043.52 → 3044.64] I love the sassiness.
[3045.30 → 3046.34] Oh my goodness.
[3047.04 → 3048.28] You know what else I love?
[3049.14 → 3053.06] We have a new shirt on LTT store.com.
[3053.14 → 3054.26] It's limited edition.
[3054.54 → 3057.42] I think Sarah did an absolutely bang up job.
[3057.54 → 3059.14] It looks super clean.
[3059.68 → 3060.44] This is it.
[3060.66 → 3063.38] It is the gold foil controller shirt.
[3063.48 → 3065.16] We are doing one run,
[3065.26 → 3066.16] ladies and gentlemen.
[3068.00 → 3069.42] And here it is.
[3069.82 → 3071.24] Oh yeah.
[3071.68 → 3073.00] That does look pretty pro.
[3073.20 → 3073.66] Uh huh.
[3073.70 → 3077.60] I also appreciate the selection of controller used for this shirt.
[3077.78 → 3078.12] Well,
[3078.26 → 3084.12] we kind of had to because the controller was the controller shirt became a thing
[3084.12 → 3087.90] after we came up with this video idea.
[3088.10 → 3090.02] So let's go ahead and do some display capture here.
[3090.10 → 3092.98] So here's our early access slash behind the scenes.
[3092.98 → 3094.84] If you guys aren't already on float plane,
[3095.04 → 3097.16] we do exclusives like a little,
[3097.16 → 3099.62] like meet the team interviews with people.
[3099.84 → 3101.00] I think we did,
[3101.00 → 3101.40] uh,
[3101.66 → 3104.40] Colin and David recently as well.
[3104.40 → 3105.94] So Madison's been working on that.
[3106.02 → 3107.06] She did a tour of the office.
[3107.18 → 3108.04] There it is.
[3108.16 → 3108.56] Uh,
[3108.56 → 3109.64] we also have early access.
[3109.64 → 3110.74] It's supposed to be a week.
[3110.82 → 3111.60] It's not a week right now.
[3111.66 → 3112.30] We're doing our best,
[3112.42 → 3112.62] but,
[3112.78 → 3113.24] uh,
[3113.24 → 3114.80] this video is not yet up on YouTube.
[3114.80 → 3116.20] It is up on float plane.
[3116.34 → 3121.56] We are making a solid gold Xbox controller.
[3121.56 → 3123.56] Like what?
[3127.16 → 3128.00] So ridiculous.
[3128.30 → 3128.40] Yeah.
[3128.44 → 3129.18] This is like,
[3129.24 → 3131.02] if this doesn't do it,
[3131.26 → 3132.54] this is my Hail Mary,
[3133.04 → 3133.74] you know,
[3134.28 → 3135.18] dammit.
[3135.28 → 3136.24] I'm going to go viral.
[3136.24 → 3138.94] If it costs me a hundred thousand dollars,
[3138.94 → 3140.60] if this doesn't do it,
[3140.60 → 3142.00] then I don't know what can,
[3142.64 → 3143.06] uh,
[3143.06 → 3143.92] but this'll be,
[3144.10 → 3145.00] this'll be out.
[3145.18 → 3147.54] This'll be out very soon on YouTube.
[3147.54 → 3151.54] I think it's a part one is going to hit on Sunday.
[3151.90 → 3152.26] Yeah.
[3152.34 → 3153.52] Part one will hit on Sunday.
[3153.76 → 3156.60] And then I think part two is going to hit float plane on Sunday.
[3156.70 → 3158.32] So if you see it on YouTube and you love it,
[3158.32 → 3158.90] uh,
[3158.96 → 3159.12] a
[3159.20 → 3159.96] you can get a shirt,
[3160.10 → 3163.32] please buy a shirt because this controller was very expensive.
[3163.78 → 3164.18] Uh,
[3164.46 → 3169.34] and B you can go subscribe to float plane where you'll be able to check out part two of the video right away.
[3169.50 → 3172.86] It's not the kind of thing that we normally would have split up into multiple parts,
[3172.86 → 3175.74] but believe it or not between the
[3175.84 → 3181.14] like the disassembly and the preparation and the casting and the finishing.
[3181.14 → 3183.92] And the reassembly and the problem-solving.
[3184.46 → 3184.98] Yeah.
[3185.18 → 3185.68] I mean,
[3185.70 → 3186.96] it would have been like a 25,
[3187.12 → 3188.26] 30-minute long video,
[3188.26 → 3191.92] which is past the point where it actually performs well on YouTube.
[3192.24 → 3196.72] So we kind of needed to cut it up to avoid having to remove anything.
[3196.72 → 3198.80] As for the third part of it.
[3199.18 → 3199.44] Well,
[3199.46 → 3201.16] I'm not making any excuses for that one.
[3201.22 → 3201.84] We're milking it.
[3202.32 → 3205.34] So part one is casting the controller.
[3205.72 → 3207.16] Part two is,
[3207.16 → 3207.96] uh,
[3207.96 → 3211.70] the finishing of the cast and then assembling the controller.
[3211.88 → 3212.68] So it's done.
[3212.78 → 3214.78] You'll see the finished controller by the end of part two.
[3215.20 → 3217.22] Part three is like,
[3217.66 → 3218.26] okay,
[3218.26 → 3221.10] we're experimenting with doing some just like,
[3221.10 → 3221.90] uh,
[3221.90 → 3223.88] more low-hanging fruit type content.
[3224.06 → 3227.20] So we did that Linus reacts to XQC's,
[3227.20 → 3227.78] uh,
[3227.78 → 3233.02] PC build because we always had this tendency to stick to our production schedule in the past.
[3233.02 → 3233.20] Like,
[3233.26 → 3233.36] Oh,
[3233.42 → 3233.66] well,
[3234.36 → 3234.72] uh,
[3234.78 → 3235.06] okay.
[3235.06 → 3236.52] Something new happened,
[3236.52 → 3237.54] but well,
[3237.56 → 3239.66] we already have a video scheduled for that day.
[3239.66 → 3241.98] So I guess we can't really do anything with that.
[3242.46 → 3250.70] And what happened was we got more and more and more organized to the point where we were never able to react to something new and exciting because we always had something in the chamber for,
[3250.70 → 3251.68] for that day.
[3252.36 → 3252.72] Um,
[3253.38 → 3256.56] so the XQC build reaction thing was an experiment where we're like,
[3256.60 → 3256.74] okay,
[3256.74 → 3256.92] no,
[3256.96 → 3258.16] let's just like push away,
[3258.26 → 3258.86] like push out,
[3259.02 → 3261.74] throw away whatever we were working on and let's pivot.
[3261.74 → 3265.26] And let's do this kind of like a low-hanging fruit,
[3265.26 → 3270.14] like reactionary slash more like viral crossover type content.
[3270.46 → 3271.84] So with the gold controller,
[3271.98 → 3272.82] what the goal is,
[3272.82 → 3279.56] is to do something that's kind of like designed as a different type of video than what we usually do.
[3279.56 → 3280.86] So it'll feature me,
[3281.00 → 3282.08] but it'll also have,
[3282.16 → 3288.48] I think it's 13 other members of the LMG team reacting to the controller.
[3288.64 → 3290.40] So they'll be seeing it for the first time.
[3290.62 → 3292.30] We'll ask them questions about it.
[3292.34 → 3292.48] Like,
[3292.54 → 3292.64] Hey,
[3292.64 → 3294.00] do you think this was a good idea?
[3294.68 → 3295.12] Um,
[3295.24 → 3296.26] do you think it's a good value?
[3296.56 → 3296.78] Uh,
[3296.78 → 3300.18] one of my favourite questions is everyone gets asked.
[3301.00 → 3302.06] This is actually great.
[3302.16 → 3302.42] So Luke,
[3302.46 → 3304.02] I know you haven't actually seen it yet,
[3304.56 → 3306.20] but you can try to answer it.
[3306.20 → 3307.62] I can tell you a couple of things about it.
[3307.66 → 3308.78] It's super heavy.
[3309.06 → 3309.32] Like,
[3309.36 → 3311.14] have you ever had hands on with gold?
[3312.36 → 3312.72] Uh,
[3312.74 → 3313.78] not that much.
[3313.90 → 3314.04] I,
[3314.08 → 3314.28] I,
[3314.28 → 3314.88] I have.
[3314.98 → 3315.26] So I,
[3315.26 → 3316.12] I understand the
[3316.16 → 3316.58] like the
[3316.58 → 3319.32] the density and how much a small amount can weigh in and whatnot,
[3319.32 → 3321.98] but definitely not that much.
[3322.26 → 3322.40] Yeah.
[3322.46 → 3322.82] Me neither.
[3322.82 → 3323.66] Um,
[3323.84 → 3326.00] so here's the question we ask people.
[3327.42 → 3328.20] If it was,
[3328.40 → 3329.78] would you take it for free?
[3330.78 → 3338.00] If you could never melt it down so you can never exchange it for currency, and it's the only controller you can ever use.
[3338.94 → 3339.34] Wow.
[3339.98 → 3340.46] Um,
[3341.58 → 3343.84] what's more important bling or functionality?
[3344.84 → 3345.24] Yeah,
[3345.36 → 3345.86] I think,
[3345.94 → 3346.64] I think no.
[3346.92 → 3347.78] Like my answer is no.
[3348.46 → 3349.62] You haven't even tried it yet.
[3349.62 → 3349.94] Luke,
[3350.66 → 3352.14] you haven't even tried it yet.
[3352.14 → 3353.02] There were going to be no.
[3353.20 → 3354.54] What if it's all flash,
[3354.72 → 3355.60] all dash?
[3356.86 → 3357.60] All dash?
[3357.68 → 3357.88] Yeah.
[3357.90 → 3358.72] You ever think of that?
[3359.34 → 3360.66] Am I not boomer enough to,
[3360.74 → 3361.24] to know?
[3361.92 → 3362.96] What do you mean all dash?
[3363.22 → 3363.50] Like,
[3363.58 → 3363.82] uh,
[3363.86 → 3364.08] well,
[3364.14 → 3364.38] you know,
[3364.38 → 3365.80] the expression like all flash,
[3365.88 → 3366.38] no dash,
[3366.58 → 3367.44] but it could be like,
[3367.98 → 3368.36] but like,
[3368.46 → 3368.76] would you,
[3368.76 → 3369.38] would you though?
[3369.42 → 3370.00] Because like we,
[3370.00 → 3372.78] you and I both have like the sick elite controllers.
[3373.24 → 3373.52] Mm-hmm.
[3374.32 → 3375.36] You'd give up.
[3375.42 → 3375.72] Wait,
[3376.18 → 3377.28] I saw the shifty eyes.
[3378.10 → 3379.42] Did you do this agreement?
[3382.14 → 3383.90] I'm going to make you watch the video.
[3384.18 → 3385.66] I'm actually going to do that to you.
[3385.88 → 3386.62] I just did it.
[3386.76 → 3387.40] I just did it.
[3387.56 → 3388.54] You're going to have to watch the video.
[3388.54 → 3389.26] I think I would say yes,
[3389.28 → 3390.74] because if I can't exchange or whatever,
[3390.94 → 3391.36] I don't even,
[3391.42 → 3392.24] I don't even like gold.
[3392.90 → 3393.24] What?
[3393.96 → 3394.32] Yeah.
[3394.56 → 3396.74] Have you seen the finished one though?
[3397.60 → 3397.96] Like,
[3398.00 → 3399.60] have you seen what it looks like?
[3400.16 → 3400.30] No.
[3400.30 → 3400.62] Okay.
[3400.96 → 3401.90] It's incredible.
[3403.54 → 3404.22] You know what?
[3404.22 → 3404.86] I'm a
[3404.86 → 3405.40] I'm a tweet.
[3405.50 → 3406.98] I'm a DM it to you right now.
[3407.40 → 3407.86] Give me,
[3408.10 → 3408.98] give me a second here.
[3409.20 → 3410.22] It's on my phone.
[3410.58 → 3410.78] Okay.
[3410.78 → 3411.30] We got to get,
[3411.40 → 3413.90] we got to get Luke's live reaction to what this thing looks like.
[3413.90 → 3416.14] Because it is unreal.
[3417.00 → 3417.40] Okay.
[3417.42 → 3417.84] Where's,
[3417.96 → 3418.22] uh,
[3418.26 → 3419.30] where's Luke in here,
[3420.00 → 3420.20] man?
[3420.20 → 3422.08] I can never figure out how to use discord.
[3422.24 → 3425.36] Why do I suck so much at discord?
[3426.04 → 3426.40] Okay.
[3426.52 → 3426.76] No,
[3426.80 → 3427.62] I want people,
[3427.74 → 3428.24] but not like,
[3428.30 → 3428.70] I don't want to,
[3428.88 → 3430.16] I don't want to friend people.
[3430.16 → 3430.92] I just want to,
[3430.92 → 3434.30] I hate you so much discord.
[3434.74 → 3436.10] You don't show online,
[3436.22 → 3436.50] Luke.
[3437.00 → 3437.54] And like,
[3437.58 → 3438.40] where's the search?
[3438.84 → 3439.04] Oh,
[3439.04 → 3440.58] the search is a separate thing.
[3440.96 → 3442.44] Who else even messages you?
[3442.56 → 3444.48] Why is it just searching this thing?
[3444.64 → 3444.92] Okay.
[3444.98 → 3445.50] It doesn't matter.
[3445.60 → 3445.98] The point is,
[3445.98 → 3446.64] I figured it out.
[3447.14 → 3448.90] I have to be the most recent person.
[3449.04 → 3450.80] You sent me this message right before when started.
[3451.36 → 3451.76] Whatever.
[3453.44 → 3453.68] Uh,
[3454.16 → 3454.42] okay.
[3454.98 → 3456.04] I think this is it.
[3456.18 → 3456.42] Okay.
[3456.50 → 3456.72] Okay.
[3456.72 → 3457.34] Just watch this,
[3457.44 → 3457.96] watch this clip,
[3458.04 → 3459.70] watch this clip and tell me you don't want it.
[3460.50 → 3460.84] Okay.
[3460.92 → 3461.30] Hold on.
[3465.00 → 3465.76] All right.
[3465.94 → 3466.42] Uh,
[3466.42 → 3467.76] what else do we got on the
[3467.76 → 3469.04] on the docket for today?
[3469.20 → 3469.36] Uh,
[3469.36 → 3470.72] what did you film this on?
[3470.90 → 3471.52] My phone?
[3472.74 → 3473.56] Why is it,
[3473.96 → 3475.66] why is it so horrible?
[3476.54 → 3476.94] Oh,
[3476.94 → 3479.20] discord compressed it like crazy.
[3479.30 → 3479.70] Probably.
[3479.84 → 3482.08] Because I filmed it within the Twitter app.
[3482.96 → 3487.56] And then I literally look like it was filmed in the nineties or earlier.
[3487.76 → 3488.74] I know you can try this one.
[3488.80 → 3489.52] Try the second one.
[3490.12 → 3490.56] Okay.
[3491.16 → 3491.72] Let's see.
[3491.90 → 3492.38] Uh,
[3492.38 → 3492.58] yeah,
[3492.58 → 3493.00] this one,
[3493.12 → 3493.88] this one should be fine.
[3494.42 → 3495.04] There you go.
[3495.62 → 3496.92] I have it wrapped in the
[3496.92 → 3497.12] uh,
[3497.12 → 3497.74] in the controller.
[3497.74 → 3498.12] Okay.
[3498.22 → 3498.42] Yeah.
[3498.42 → 3499.18] That's way better.
[3499.18 → 3506.04] That's pretty sick.
[3506.04 → 3507.12] Oh,
[3507.12 → 3508.50] you can tell how heavy.
[3508.70 → 3508.92] Wow.
[3508.96 → 3511.00] The back is so cool.
[3511.30 → 3511.56] Okay.
[3511.56 → 3516.98] the back is really cool you can tell how heavy it is just when you pick it up, and it's not like
[3516.98 → 3521.94] you clearly don't struggle, but you can see the resistance that it has you know oh yeah that's
[3521.94 → 3529.36] pretty crazy it's pretty cool okay so I'm changing my answer to yes actually okay you'll have to try
[3529.36 → 3534.20] it you'll have to mostly just because of the unobtained that that's actually I think that
[3534.20 → 3538.68] actually changed my answer more than seeing the finished product because while I was sitting here
[3538.68 → 3543.10] thinking about I was like but no one else would have one literally no one else that's kind of cool
[3543.10 → 3551.40] so you might suck at games, but you might make you worse, but you'll look cooler while you do it
[3551.40 → 3559.00] in other news there's a piece of malware targeting mac devices dubbed silver sparrow almost 40 000
[3559.00 → 3565.44] systems have been infected across over 150 countries but most of them are in the U.S. this is one of the
[3565.44 → 3571.02] first malicious pieces of software to use native code for the new m1 chips and is installed via apple installer
[3571.02 → 3578.22] packages, and it's named update.PKG or updater.PKG the curious thing is that it's mostly still a mystery
[3578.22 → 3582.38] nobody seems sure how exactly the malware is being delivered or what its purpose is
[3582.38 → 3589.66] um so what does that what does that mean uh it means we'll probably find out eventually this has
[3589.66 → 3596.68] happened before uh where something just kind of gets into a system or a series of systems and then
[3596.68 → 3603.50] lays dormant for a while um, but security has been breached you know like it's in there that's bad
[3603.50 → 3611.32] um yeah got it so it's made from JavaScript code that installs a launch agent list file which launches a
[3611.32 → 3616.24] script every hour so it contacts the command and control server then checks for the file
[3616.24 → 3624.02] uh tilde slash library slash period underscore ensue to see if it should uninstall determines if
[3624.02 → 3629.76] there's a new version of the malware dang self-updating malware it's great isn't that great
[3629.76 → 3635.16] yeah downloads a payload from download URL parameter and command and control server
[3635.16 → 3640.50] yeah and then if downloaded it launches it with arms data as the arguments for the code
[3640.50 → 3645.78] arguments yeah yep so pretty straightforward we have no idea what it's supposed to do
[3645.78 → 3650.42] but the two command and control server domains were registered in August and december 2020 so
[3650.42 → 3656.26] it's pretty new, but it's been around for months good luck everybody to be clear I'm not saying
[3656.26 → 3664.30] apples have viruses uh obviously there are viruses all across the board I'm just saying that
[3664.30 → 3668.42] there are viruses all across the board and let's not pretend that there's anything other than that
[3668.42 → 3673.52] fries closed fries electronics did you ever have the pleasure of visiting one Luke
[3673.52 → 3684.42] no never man it was kind of like Best Buy meets radio shack back in the like late 90s meets NCI
[3684.42 → 3691.12] and meets Costco I've been to I've been to a micro centre and I actually thought that was really cool how
[3691.12 → 3700.80] do they compare if micro centre is like Lester's market then fries is like it's Costco like it's just
[3700.80 → 3708.74] oh cool it was on a very like just an incredible scale this place i I'm surprised and i and I know
[3708.74 → 3713.22] we're going to get into it, they blame things like the coronavirus and like shifting purchasing styles
[3713.22 → 3718.20] and like lots of this kind of stuff, but it seems like a weird time every place I know of is just
[3718.20 → 3723.46] exploding like tech stuff is flying off the shelves constantly everyone else seems to be doing great
[3723.46 → 3733.38] yeah I'm so here's the thing fries and there's a really, really great video about it from oh what is
[3733.38 → 3743.10] the channel called I think it's called retail archaeology uh yeah I'm pretty sure
[3743.10 → 3752.36] I'm pretty sure that's the channel fries yep yeah did an absolutely fantastic video uh two years ago
[3752.36 → 3759.48] uh talking about fries going out of business and a year ago talking about hey is fries going to be
[3759.48 → 3762.38] gone soon um
[3762.38 → 3770.06] this has the writing has clearly been on the wall for a long time and the reality of it is that fries
[3770.06 → 3778.42] business model of like these enormous stores with the way that rent prices have gone up and the way
[3778.42 → 3786.48] electronics margins have gone down is just not sustainable anymore so whatever they might say
[3786.48 → 3793.10] about COVID-19 and blah blah blah the part they say about changes in the retail industry that's
[3793.10 → 3800.10] certainly true but pretty much anything else is not kind of what happened so it's clear that they've
[3800.10 → 3808.32] been winding down for quite some time their stores have had empty shelves for literally years um do you feel
[3808.32 → 3815.22] do you feel like they kind of gave up oh I mean I don't think they had any choice but to give up, but it's pretty
[3815.22 → 3820.88] sad like couldn't they have just transitioned to smaller stores if that's the problem well here's the thing if you've
[3820.88 → 3828.10] never been in a fries you don't really like to understand a fries so they had these crazy incredible
[3828.10 → 3834.14] like themed stores like people are going to look back at this in 50 years and be like holy smokes
[3834.14 → 3840.78] that was a store like look at this one that's got an UFO looking like it crashed into the front of it
[3840.78 → 3847.88] they had all these cool props inside and stuff like going to fries was totally an experience
[3847.88 → 3855.74] and wow okay yeah you just I'm just catching up with the stream that's that's what the heck
[3855.74 → 3861.76] it's incredible you just can't really do it anymore so you know a lot of people are really sad about it
[3861.76 → 3868.92] but I guess uh I guess there's you know more business for more business for micro centre or
[3868.92 → 3876.06] if anyone else wants to come in and swoop in and uh snatch up that business that's uh yeah it's
[3876.06 → 3879.86] very unfortunate there's no way that you're going to end up with an electronics retailer back in a
[3879.86 → 3887.16] space like that though the couple that I went to were just monstrous they were just unbelievable like
[3887.16 → 3894.40] just having never mind stocking it having enough demo units that it wouldn't feel like an empty
[3894.40 → 3901.86] cavernous vault would cost hundreds of thousands even getting into the seven figures just to have
[3901.86 → 3907.22] enough product out on the shelves to look not you know and barren and ridiculous
[3907.22 → 3914.76] our last topic is apple it has been forced to show a repairability score in France do you want to run
[3914.76 → 3918.92] us through this one Luke I feel like I ended up doing all the topics today I'm sorry I just got carried
[3918.92 → 3925.82] away no worries i one thing I wanted to mention before we move on uh is there anywhere that you shop or
[3925.82 → 3931.84] or just anything that you give your patronage to that you do so with the hopes of helping them stay afloat
[3931.84 → 3939.26] you think so I tuned out for a second because I was reading a super chat I didn't know you were
[3939.26 → 3945.24] asking me anything I'm sorry go ahead is there anywhere that you shop or anywhere just in
[3945.24 → 3955.84] general yeah I understand now um man gee I don't know uh I have one oh I know who yours is I know who
[3955.84 → 3960.84] yours is I've talked about it before so it's not that interesting yeah willow video is a totally
[3960.84 → 3965.42] interesting story I tell you what why don't you tell them about willow video while I see if I can
[3965.42 → 3971.54] think of something willow videos this little and like I don't think they know that I've ever
[3971.54 → 3977.48] talked about them on wan show before, but they're this little uh kind of like video game store that
[3977.48 → 3986.46] has existed in this area for a really long time um like I'm talking i i I lined up in a very long line
[3986.46 → 3990.16] of people inside the store because I don't think this was a midnight launch I don't think I was old
[3990.16 → 3995.68] enough for that at that time um so that my brother and I could get I believe it was a single copy of
[3995.68 → 4002.60] it was either Pokémon red or blue for game boy um I remember they had like bins like actual bins
[4002.60 → 4007.78] as you're going through the lineup of the player's guide for it because the internet was barely a thing
[4007.78 → 4015.08] at that time, so people actually like really wanted the player's guide um if it was a really cool store
[4015.08 → 4021.20] and has somehow existed it's its ran by like the same lady runs it that I feel like has run it
[4021.20 → 4026.64] forever all this kind of stuff they sell retro games now they still sell new games when Pokémon
[4026.64 → 4033.22] cards became a big thing more recently they jumped on that now they sell Pokémon cards it's just a really
[4033.22 → 4040.84] cool little store that has existed forever and I'm not really a fan of game stop or EB games so
[4040.84 → 4046.12] i I try to shop there it helped keep them around because it's got to be tough like there's their
[4046.12 → 4052.88] surrounded by like Best Buy and multiple EB games locations yeah and there's this little shop that's
[4052.88 → 4060.56] trying to make it work I even remember one time I was eating at a sushi place and the lady who runs
[4060.56 → 4066.00] willow video was sitting there next to another person talking about how like the business is hard
[4066.00 → 4075.30] and I was like well that's definitely legitimately true because I'm sure it is but yeah okay so i just
[4075.30 → 4079.82] I just try to buy things from there if I'm going to buy it anyway that's all I don't have anything
[4079.82 → 4088.56] current but do you remember that um that Vietnamese soup place in Aberdeen mall that's a place that I used
[4088.56 → 4094.44] to go out of my way to go to i am I'm still sad you know what now this is my personal line of
[4094.44 → 4103.22] Sebastian commitment if is you're listening, or you know who used to run the basil leaf restaurant in
[4103.22 → 4109.90] Aberdeen mall I will personally I will personally seed fund you to start up your restaurant again
[4109.90 → 4117.66] because it was a really sad story uh I used to go there probably three times a week they were so
[4117.66 → 4125.82] nice uh they would always give me like it's its so funny I've been guilted at times in my life into
[4125.82 → 4132.42] eating things that I didn't want to eat before um that's definitely happened but never by a restaurant
[4132.42 → 4140.34] so you know me I'm a pretty I'm kind of a picky eater uh I know what I like and what I liked was
[4140.34 → 4148.58] their like chicken noodle Vietnamese style soup yeah that was what I wanted and I became such a
[4148.58 → 4154.90] regular customer because I just liked it um that I would be standing at the back of the line and by
[4154.90 → 4160.44] the time I got to the till they would just have my soup ready for me and hand it to me because they
[4160.44 → 4166.04] knew exactly what I wanted they were I mean this never happens anymore this sounds like the kind of
[4166.04 → 4172.00] thing that would happen in like the 50s you know i would forget money or like I'd forget my
[4172.00 → 4177.38] wallet and I'd be like I'm so sorry I don't have any money, and they would literally give me my food
[4177.38 → 4183.24] and be like don't worry about it, I'll get you next time and I'd be like thanks bro I'm going to eat my
[4183.24 → 4189.54] lunch now even though I'm a space cadet and I don't have any money like they were so nice so anyway
[4189.54 → 4195.16] i I was like I was such a regular for so long that eventually they started giving me these free
[4195.16 → 4203.74] deserts, and it's like okay Luke how big of a fan of eggs is I uh about as much as you that's my hint
[4203.74 → 4208.52] yeah so not at all then cool I was thinking like I don't think I've ever seen you eat eggs but then i
[4208.52 → 4214.12] kind of avoid them like the plague so I'm not sure so yeah so they start giving me this like
[4214.12 → 4220.02] egg dessert thing that is like a's like a cold dessert, and it like they flip it over the thing
[4220.02 → 4224.02] and then there's like the sauce they make it look all nice and everything, and they start giving it to
[4224.02 → 4229.64] me for free and I try to politely decline right I'm like oh gee thank you, but you know what like I'm
[4229.64 → 4235.42] good you can give it to the next person I'm so I'm not that hungry today you know like all the ways
[4235.42 → 4240.22] that you try to like to say without saying hey that looks disgusting and I don't want to eat it
[4240.22 → 4249.38] um anyway they completely didn't understand or didn't care that I did not want to eat this egg
[4249.38 → 4255.18] dessert and I understand now that they've like opened it they can't really like to put it back
[4255.18 → 4260.00] so it was handmade though like now that they've opened the had these little cups and they
[4260.00 → 4263.38] would like to make them, and they put them in the fridge and they so they don't just unwrap it and
[4263.38 → 4266.26] then they put it on the plate for you flip it over it looked all nice there's kind of like brown on
[4266.26 → 4270.20] the top anyway the point is I wouldn't say it looked nice but yeah well it didn't look nice to
[4270.20 → 4277.86] me it was it looked fancy though um so anyway the first couple of times I like I confess I threw them
[4277.86 → 4286.32] away because I knew it was an egg dessert I knew I wouldn't like it I tried a little bite of it and I was
[4286.32 → 4295.40] like it's kind of egg yum so than the next time I came they like asked me about it, they were like oh what
[4295.40 → 4299.96] do you think and I'm like oh crap okay I need to make more of an effort to eat this thing okay long
[4299.96 → 4309.00] story short I absolutely started loving them total acquired taste because every single time I came
[4309.00 → 4315.46] they gave me a free one of these just for like being a regular customer um then they started giving
[4315.46 → 4320.46] me free little like chicken wings with my orders so I'd get two free chicken wings and a free dessert
[4320.46 → 4326.90] with every order they were so nice i I really wish I remembered the guy's name but if anyone knows
[4326.90 → 4334.46] who used to run basil leaf in Aberdeen get them in touch with me, i will personally seed fund
[4334.46 → 4341.28] them to start a restaurant again so I can go there and get my noodle soup and my chicken wings and my
[4341.28 → 4348.60] dessert and so what happened oh right what happened the sad part is they were shut down for a little
[4348.60 → 4356.10] while because uh yeah the guy that ran it was you know sick but like nothing horrible as far as i
[4356.10 → 4362.08] knew, and so I was like oh so i I would actually go to Aberdeen and just there wasn't really anything
[4362.08 → 4367.44] else I like to eat there so I would just like not get lunch but I would keep going back kind of like
[4367.44 → 4372.70] a dog whose owner's dead you know whatever that burger place was and both be upset about it yeah
[4372.70 → 4379.90] yeah it's like not happy yeah it's not that good um so I'd keep going back and there were times that
[4379.90 → 4385.50] I just didn't even eat and then what happened is he was back and I was like ah you're back and so
[4385.50 → 4390.44] everything was good for a while but what happened was there was enough of a disruption to his business
[4390.44 → 4397.48] that when he broke his arm shortly after, and he couldn't prepare the food he didn't have enough
[4397.48 → 4404.80] money to afford someone to just like run it for him, and so he ended up as far as I know he ended up
[4404.80 → 4413.30] losing the restaurant um so it made me really sad a because I wanted to eat the food and b because he
[4413.30 → 4420.64] was so nice and so kind to me even though we probably only spoke an overlapping like 40 words or so
[4420.64 → 4428.90] um you know like communication was not the high point like the strong point of this
[4428.90 → 4437.18] relationship but i yeah i I'm i I'm super down I'm super down to get the restaurant back if is that
[4437.18 → 4440.62] would be if that's what he wants if that's what he wants of course if he doesn't want to run a
[4440.62 → 4447.08] restaurant any more then I'm chill I'm good all right I think that's pretty much it for the wan show for
[4447.08 → 4451.36] today we should probably do a couple super chats how about the one that I was reading and I wasn't
[4451.36 → 4457.28] uh listening to Luke hey Linus and Luke when fry shut down this week I was having them build me a new
[4457.28 → 4463.02] gaming pc uh-oh so when they shut down both my old and new pcs were stuck there till I reached out to
[4463.02 → 4473.66] my local TV station I got them back today dang like what that's lucky you got it back because I can tell
[4473.66 → 4478.22] you at the NCI bankruptcy option there was definitely customer stuff there
[4478.22 → 4486.32] uh unbox warehouse says just recycling some of that YouTube money for some of my favourite creators

[4492.96 → 4499.88] way back in the NCI days absolutely I do you better believe it uh Brendan I have finished your
[4499.88 → 4504.06] finish your super chats but once you're done I've got I've got something we can't end right away
[4504.06 → 4508.08] Brandon asks do you think the current GPU market will have any lasting effect on the market for
[4508.08 → 4511.90] other components since fewer people are building or upgrading well fewer people aren't people are
[4511.90 → 4518.08] totally still building and upgrading um but in terms of lasting effect the outside effects that are
[4518.08 → 4523.84] causing the GPU shortages will definitely have continued to have an effect I mean I made that video
[4523.84 → 4529.22] almost a year ago now buy a computer now is what I said man I don't know if I have I don't know if
[4529.22 → 4535.22] my crystal ball has ever or will ever work as well as it did that day I was so on the fence about
[4535.22 → 4542.32] making that video Andrew says you guys need to go on drinking bros after Neil deGrasse Tyson this week
[4542.32 → 4550.32] I don't think I'm invited yeah uh pernicious hey thanks pernicious appreciate you uh grandma hates

[4572.50 → 4576.52] be an interesting video I think it's the kind of thing that might actually necessitate like travelling
[4576.52 → 4581.06] to these places and doing like a really in-depth piece it's more of like uh that sounds like more of
[4581.06 → 4588.34] like a doc or a mini doc versus kind of our style but definitely an interesting topic uh Robert mail
