[0.00 --> 11.40]  What is up viewers on the internet or should I call you guys internet explorers? Yes, welcome
[11.40 --> 17.16]  to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show for you guys today. Obviously, the big news
[17.16 --> 26.28]  has been everywhere r slash Wall Street bets absolutely sticking it to the man and of course
[26.28 --> 33.30]  getting help from many many other communities which we are hoping of course to add ourselves
[33.30 --> 38.94]  to by the end of this stream. We'll get we'll get you guys the rundown on what that is and
[38.94 --> 46.26]  talk about what we're planning to do to do our little part here. Google, I mean this is
[46.26 --> 53.66]  closely related news, Google removed negative Robin Hood reviews which is absolutely fascinating.
[53.66 --> 60.68]  I don't know that Google has ever removed I think it was 150 no just shy of a hundred thousand
[60.68 --> 68.16]  negative reviews of the Robin Hood app that seemed to be designed to just drive down the
[68.16 --> 72.68]  reputation of Robin Hood. Luke what else we got today?
[72.68 --> 75.68]  Apple is super rich.
[75.68 --> 77.68]  Like that's not news.
[77.68 --> 83.36]  We're doing not as well recently you were wrong because they're even more rich than you could
[83.36 --> 88.34]  have possibly probably believed. Also not news at all. Sorry.
[88.34 --> 89.60]  That's not news at all.
[90.20 --> 95.66]  Okay, but there's there's some news and there's not very it's a super interesting show. Okay,
[95.66 --> 101.12]  Linus and also audience don't worry about it. Intel bolsters engineering leadership with returning
[101.12 --> 108.16]  technology technologists. I'm gonna pull Sunil Shinoi. It's just my name backwards so it's easy.
[111.04 --> 118.64]  That's true. That's funny. Except I don't know how to say your name backwards properly, but I hope I hope it's Sunil Shinoi and more.
[118.64 --> 122.48]  Hooray. And more and more. Roll that intro. Wait, that's my job.
[122.48 --> 147.44]  Show is brought to you today by
[147.44 --> 154.88]  Honey Malwarebytes and the privacy giveaway, whatever that means.
[155.68 --> 162.08]  All right. So why don't we jump right into what's happening? We can start with no, we can't really
[162.08 --> 168.40]  start with Google removing the negative Robin Hood reviews. So users were users were review bombing.
[168.40 --> 176.48]  To be clear, this was probably the most justified review bombing of all time. Like this was not bots.
[176.48 --> 184.16]  This was actual users. Well, okay, there were probably. Okay. There may have been bots,
[184.16 --> 190.96]  but those bots were created by real people. And there was a very large, very significant amount
[190.96 --> 196.40]  of real people that were very upset. Yes. But we can't really start with that without giving some of
[196.40 --> 202.48]  the context here. So if you have been living under a rock for the entirety of this week,
[202.48 --> 211.44]  small time traders have been pumping up the price of GameStop stock, and it's risen over a thousand
[211.44 --> 218.72]  percent in the last few weeks. And the impact of this is that enormous hedge funds have been forced
[218.72 --> 226.48]  to take losses due to their shorting of the stock. If you're not familiar with what shorting a stock means,
[226.48 --> 233.12]  I am not qualified to come up with like a perfect, super concise definition on my own.
[233.12 --> 239.12]  The official definition by MarketWatch is shorting or short selling is when an investor borrows shares
[239.12 --> 245.20]  and immediately sells them, hoping he can scoop them up later at a lower price, return them to the
[245.20 --> 250.64]  lender and pocket the difference. But shorting is much riskier than buying stocks or what's known as
[250.64 --> 258.56]  taking a long position. So basically, in a nutshell, what it means is if Luke had some company,
[258.56 --> 265.68]  Floatplane, let's say for example, and I thought Floatplane was a giant piece of and completely doomed.
[265.68 --> 272.64]  What I would do is I would say, all right, Luke, your stock is worth a dollar per share. I'm going to buy
[272.64 --> 282.64]  a thousand shares for a thousand dollars. So I buy them immediately. I buy them and then I immediately
[282.64 --> 288.16]  sell them. So I have like bought something for a thousand dollars and now I have my thousand dollars
[288.16 --> 294.32]  back and the goal. So, but I borrowed the money. So I borrowed the money from, let's say, Yvonne.
[294.32 --> 301.60]  I borrow a thousand dollars and then I buy the shares and I immediately sell the shares. So then
[301.60 --> 309.12]  what my goal is, is to wait it out while Floatplane plummets to the ground or water as it were,
[309.12 --> 315.84]  while Floatplane plummets to the water. And then I take my thousand dollars that I borrowed. And what I
[315.84 --> 324.00]  want to do is as the shares go down, I want to buy them back at a lower price, repay Yvonne, who I borrowed
[324.00 --> 331.04]  money from and keep the profit. Okay. So I returned the shares to Yvonne. I keep the difference between
[331.04 --> 337.12]  the thousand dollars that I spent initially and what's left over. And I have made money for basically
[337.12 --> 343.04]  doing absolutely nothing. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to try
[343.04 --> 348.40]  this one more time. You borrow shares, not money. Okay. Borrow shares, sell them. So you've got this,
[348.40 --> 354.40]  like, you've got this money you didn't earn. Then you effectively want to sell, you want to buy back
[354.40 --> 360.24]  the shares for less and then return the shares and keep the extra money. That's how it works. And it's
[360.24 --> 366.88]  like, it, there's a reason that this is convoluted and normal people who don't play around with this
[366.88 --> 376.16]  stuff all day, every day. Do not do that. Like us. Don't think about things that way. Yes.
[376.16 --> 383.04]  Don't take, don't take any investment advice or any ideas or even probably any thoughts from this
[383.04 --> 388.96]  stream. Neither of us have any idea what we're doing. Exactly. People are like, that's a horrible
[388.96 --> 392.56]  explanation. Okay. All right. All right. We'll try one more time. We'll try one more time. You're betting on
[392.56 --> 396.64]  that company to fail. And if they fail, you make money. People are still correcting stuff I already
[396.64 --> 400.24]  corrected. So I don't, I don't think they know what they're talking about. So the point is,
[400.24 --> 406.88]  the point is you're betting on it to fail. This is not an investment. This is a bet that the stock
[406.88 --> 413.76]  will go down and that you can make money by borrowing the stock and hoping that you can buy it back at a
[413.76 --> 418.32]  lower price and pocket the difference. That's what you're doing there. That's the fast explanation.
[418.32 --> 429.84]  So what happens is if a large hedge fund shorts a stock like GameStop, you know, to the tune of
[429.84 --> 438.40]  millions of dollars, potentially, what can happen is if that stock goes up at some point, part of the
[438.40 --> 445.92]  agreement when you short a stock is that you have to buy the shares back eventually. And so when you're,
[445.92 --> 453.04]  when you're shorting the stock, what you can do is either the stock goes down and you sit and watch
[453.04 --> 457.68]  your, watch your money just roll in and you decide when's the right time to pull the trigger when you
[457.68 --> 465.04]  think it's bottomed out and you pull your money out and you're like, I am profiting off of everyone
[465.04 --> 469.52]  else's loss. Good job me. I made, you know, tens of millions of dollars or a hundred million dollars or
[469.52 --> 476.24]  whatever. Or what happens is the stock starts to go up. Now that's bad if you're a short seller,
[476.24 --> 482.00]  because as the stock goes up, you still have to buy back those shares you borrowed. And if you have
[482.00 --> 489.76]  to buy them back at a higher price, well, guess what? You have to actually contribute more money than what
[489.76 --> 498.32]  you got in the first place. So what Wall Street Bets is doing is they're essentially saying, you know
[498.32 --> 506.64]  what, edge funds. Like, why does this mechanism even exist? I don't necessarily agree with Elon Musk about
[506.64 --> 512.40]  everything, but he put this pretty well. Where's, where's his, where's his tweet about this?
[512.40 --> 517.36]  He says, you can't sell horse houses. You don't own. I mean, horses too. You can't sell horses. You
[517.36 --> 524.64]  don't own. Unless it's, unless you're pre-selling an unborn foal, then you could sell a horse you don't
[524.64 --> 530.72]  own. But anyway, you can't sell cars you don't own unless you're taking pre-orders. I mean, kind of
[530.72 --> 536.80]  the same thing. But you can sell stock that you don't own. You can also sell houses that weren't built yet.
[536.80 --> 542.08]  Yeah, that's true. You actually, you actually can do that. Whatever. His point still stands.
[543.04 --> 550.24]  Why can you sell stock that you don't actually own? You should only be, you should only invest in a
[550.24 --> 557.76]  company because you actually believe in the underlying business. At least that's sort of the
[557.76 --> 564.96]  like conventional advice. Over the last couple of weeks, things have gotten pretty darn crazy.
[565.68 --> 570.24]  So there's so like, and again, there was a comment talking about how, like,
[570.24 --> 575.28]  I love how every creator and podcast is trying to explain stocks right now. Yeah. And maybe we're
[575.28 --> 580.16]  not doing the greatest job of it, but we're trying to trying to get people that haven't somehow haven't
[580.16 --> 583.92]  seen this somewhat up to speed. So we can talk about some of the other parts of this.
[583.92 --> 594.56]  Yeah. And, and I, so I have heard from some people that shorting exists to try to recorrect the stock
[594.56 --> 603.60]  market. The problem is that it's not being used in the way it's not being used for the reason it was
[603.60 --> 610.56]  originally created. If that makes sense. People are now abusing the tool to like super tank companies
[610.56 --> 617.44]  with just massive amounts of weight in order to abuse that to make tons of profit. They're not using
[617.44 --> 626.08]  it to, um, to recorrect the market. So yeah. And when they're targeting smaller stocks, like to be
[626.08 --> 632.16]  clear, large companies get shorted to Apple gets shorted Tesla gets shorted, but when they target a
[632.16 --> 641.28]  relatively small company that's got a low market cap, shorting is open to an incredible amount of, uh,
[641.28 --> 649.92]  abuse because what you can do is you can heavily short it and then you can manipulate it and force it
[649.92 --> 657.92]  to bomb. And then you can reap a whole bunch of reward for basically doing nothing. It's abusive. And the
[657.92 --> 665.44]  funniest thing about all of this is that the hedge fund managers who are so upset about what wall
[665.44 --> 675.76]  street bets is doing saying it's like it's abusive are literally doing that. So anyway, GameStop was one
[675.76 --> 684.88]  of the most heavily shorted companies on wall street. And what has happened since wall street bets decided to
[684.88 --> 692.24]  begin this crusade is they have actually, and it's so funny that Robin hood. So that's the kind of,
[692.24 --> 696.72]  what is it? No fees. I forget what the fees are. I think Robin hood is mostly American. Uh, what,
[696.72 --> 701.60]  what's our, uh, what's our wealth simple is kind of the Canadian equivalent of Robin hood. Yeah.
[701.60 --> 707.36]  I don't think Robin hood. It's yeah. Commission free structure, commission free structure. There you go.
[707.36 --> 714.40]  So, so Robin hood, ironically, since they appear to not have actually intended, this has
[714.40 --> 721.52]  participated directly in the redistribution of wealth from the very, very rich who didn't earn it to,
[722.48 --> 729.84]  I don't know. I don't know necessarily about the poor, but definitely some poor and some medium income
[729.92 --> 735.92]  and some high income. There's some people that, that YOLO'd there. And again, don't take stock advice from us.
[735.92 --> 741.36]  We have no idea what we're talking about. Yeah. Um, et cetera, et cetera. But there are some people that
[741.36 --> 749.12]  somehow found success that were poor and just hard YOLO'd their $600 stimulus checks. Like that did
[749.12 --> 754.96]  happen. It's a bit of a meme that's going around. It did happen to some people. I suspect the main winners
[754.96 --> 763.36]  in this are not poor people. Probably not. I suspect the main winners on this, or were people with a lot of
[764.88 --> 770.48]  liquid funds that they could throw at things and not worry about if they lost. And we're on top of this and
[770.48 --> 775.92]  saw where this was going and invested in it and made tons. I suspect that's the majority of the
[775.92 --> 785.28]  profit that happened, but still, um, there's a bunch of, of average people around that have made quite a
[785.28 --> 792.48]  bit of money off of this. So, yeah. So that, that I consider to be a pretty darn good thing. So one user,
[792.48 --> 801.04]  deep value, uh, had an investment that peaked at over 33 million after making an initial YOLO investment
[801.04 --> 807.52]  of $50,000. And he or she, uh, is currently somewhat of a role model for the wall street
[807.52 --> 814.08]  bet subreddit, garnering intense praise and rallying the troops to hold their shares, forcing short
[814.08 --> 819.92]  stocking firms to buy back the stock at insane prices. Because the thing is the longer you hold
[819.92 --> 828.64]  the greater it rises, the more pressure these hedge funds are under to like cut their losses at some
[828.64 --> 834.64]  point. Like if they think they can wait it out, then they'll wait it out because the reality of it
[834.64 --> 841.20]  is GameStop is not coming back to the forefront of us retail that that's not, that's not a thing that's
[841.20 --> 848.64]  happening. Yeah. But they can only borrow those shares for so long and they can only expose themselves
[848.64 --> 854.16]  to so much risk. So the whole thing is very tactical. And what I'm going to say is don't
[854.16 --> 863.28]  take any of my advice. Okay. Take the advice of the community there that has played this absolutely
[863.84 --> 870.96]  perfectly. So I'm not going to say, yeah, or don't cause it's still super YOLO. Yeah. Now's the,
[870.96 --> 876.00]  apparently it's a guy he got interviewed recently and it peaked at over 50 million. So we are,
[876.00 --> 881.60]  we're basically just saying, Hey, Oh, apparently he cashed nine and a half million of it. So they,
[881.60 --> 889.44]  there you go. Someone with $50,000 to, to, to invest in something like this. Probably not exactly,
[889.44 --> 896.16]  you know, the poor that Robin hood had in mind, but yeah. Ah, yes. Okay. So here's one of the other
[896.16 --> 900.80]  things that puts pressure on the hedge funds. They're also charged interest on what they borrowed.
[900.80 --> 906.88]  Apparently the interest is currently at 11 billion us dollars because the more the stock goes to the
[906.88 --> 912.80]  moon, the heavier the interest is that, that kind of makes sense. So, and the people they borrow the
[912.80 --> 917.20]  shares from can force them to return at any time. So these are, these are all mechanisms that I'm not
[917.20 --> 922.80]  super familiar with because I have never been tempted at any point in my life to short a stock.
[922.80 --> 930.40]  It's just not anything to do with, with what I want to do. But what I will say is that I think the
[930.40 --> 936.80]  income and wealth inequality is one of the biggest problems in the world right now, perhaps the,
[936.80 --> 940.80]  I'm not going to say the biggest problem facing humanity, because we definitely have environmental
[940.80 --> 948.08]  issues that could wipe us all out, regardless of how much money we have. Um, but it is one of the
[948.08 --> 954.08]  biggest issues facing humanity right now. And so I want to, I want to participate. So a lot of you
[954.08 --> 961.20]  have sent super chats into the show. Normally I just do absolutely nothing with those, but today,
[961.20 --> 968.80]  uh, we're, we're going to have some fun. So I am going to match you guys. And then I am going to
[969.60 --> 977.28]  5x that number and I am going to buy GameStop and we're going to ride it into the ground. So
[978.64 --> 984.96]  that is my personal, that is my personal guarantee of quality, because as much as that, it's very
[984.96 --> 992.32]  clear that I do not fully understand the mechanisms that work. What I enjoy very, very much is people
[992.32 --> 1000.08]  who are extremely wealthy for doing absolutely nothing and them losing their money because a bunch
[1000.08 --> 1007.04]  of small guys teamed up to stick it to them. I love it because you know what? I'm not exactly poor.
[1007.04 --> 1012.72]  I can afford to match all of these. I can afford to kiss that money goodbye and never see it again.
[1012.72 --> 1017.92]  So it's not like it's, it's, it's not like, you know, these people are campaigning for me. This is
[1017.92 --> 1026.16]  not to save me or anything like that, but I do actually work for my money. So that's a key difference.
[1026.16 --> 1033.92]  Like when we make videos, we actually, at least I believe are creating some kind of actual value.
[1034.40 --> 1038.40]  We're not just, we're not just shifting money around. You guys remember Ivan who used to work
[1038.40 --> 1044.08]  at Linus Media Group. So he had a, he had a really great, he had a really great story that he loved to tell.
[1044.08 --> 1047.12]  He's told it to me at least three or four times in the time I've known him.
[1047.12 --> 1055.28]  Um, so he goes, um, a son walks up to his father's getting some food out of the fridge. His son walks
[1055.28 --> 1063.04]  up and he says, uh, Papa, what do you do for work? And, uh, his dad opens up the fridge, uh, takes out
[1063.04 --> 1069.68]  a ham. Okay. And then he told me this and then puts it put, yeah, of course he has takes out the ham
[1070.24 --> 1075.44]  and puts it back in the fridge. And the son goes, sorry, I don't really, I don't really understand.
[1076.00 --> 1081.52]  Uh, and his dad goes, well, that's what I do. I take, I take something from here and I, I put it over
[1081.52 --> 1089.28]  here and his son goes, well, uh, but you, you, you took the ham and you just put it back. How do you,
[1089.28 --> 1096.24]  how do you make any money? And the dad goes, ah, yes, but do you see my fingers? They're greasy.
[1096.24 --> 1102.00]  And it's like, yeah, dipping your, dipping your, dipping your fingers into just a little bit of
[1102.00 --> 1106.88]  everyone else actually doing any work. I don't, I don't respect it. I'm sorry.
[1106.88 --> 1112.16]  I just don't respect it. So that's what we're doing. And. Hmm.
[1114.72 --> 1123.84]  What some big super chats. Oh, some big super chats. I told you, we were talking before the show
[1123.84 --> 1130.16]  and I, he said five X and I said, you should do two X. I said, I said, you should do two X or you
[1130.16 --> 1136.64]  should do like, uh, equal value. I did. I. Yvonne's going to kill me, but I'm a man of my word.
[1137.52 --> 1140.88]  I will not, I will not let down the rocket ship to the moon.
[1140.88 --> 1153.20]  All right. We're up to two grand. You're what? You're over two grand. We're well,
[1153.20 --> 1158.48]  we were up to now we're at, it's moving very fast, sir. We got two grand. So that's 10,000.
[1158.48 --> 1166.24]  That's 10. So that's 10. Nice. Okay. Cool. You know what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
[1166.24 --> 1170.72]  change the tab over there. I'm going to move to the street analytics.
[1173.28 --> 1179.84]  And, uh, okay, let's go ahead and move on to one of our other topics. So other meme stocks.
[1179.84 --> 1184.24]  Yeah. I don't, I don't think we're quite done. Yeah. Other meme stocks that, uh, people have been
[1184.24 --> 1190.48]  investing on to similarly put pressure on short sellers are AMC. Uh, there was some super small
[1190.48 --> 1196.00]  oil company that spikes like a thousand percent or something like that. Uh, silver is projected
[1196.00 --> 1199.76]  it hasn't really done anything yet, but it's projected to be another big squeeze,
[1200.40 --> 1204.96]  another big short squeeze. So what a short squeeze is this, this one, I understand. Um,
[1204.96 --> 1212.48]  that's when there's a whole bunch of very large shorts on the stock and, um, you drive it up,
[1212.48 --> 1219.52]  squeezing the people who are holding short positions. So the more, the more large hedge funds
[1219.52 --> 1225.36]  are shorting a stock, the more you can effectively squeeze them out and force them to bail. Uh, and
[1225.36 --> 1231.44]  there's a whole timing to this that the R slash wall street bets is all kind of got figured out
[1231.44 --> 1236.80]  people who know a lot more than me, but what's really cool about AMC in particular is as someone
[1236.80 --> 1244.24]  who actually loves movies, but doesn't really, I'm not really the biggest fan of the theater industry
[1244.24 --> 1251.44]  necessarily, but like, I don't want it to be gone. Um, what something like this does is if people invest
[1251.44 --> 1259.84]  in AMC and actually hold, if you really do hold, it might just get them through the pandemic,
[1260.72 --> 1267.92]  which I mean, I wouldn't mind independent theaters making a return either, but you know,
[1267.92 --> 1274.72]  that business model might've sailed already as it is anyway. And I personally, I'd rather have movie
[1274.72 --> 1279.76]  theaters to go to than not have movie theaters to go to. So that's pretty cool. And if for no other
[1279.76 --> 1287.04]  reason than it really demonstrates the power of the small guy when mobilized by something like the
[1287.04 --> 1292.40]  internet. Um, so massive, massive respect to wall street bets. Um, I will apparently be
[1292.40 --> 1308.32]  doing my part to the tune of, Oh, there's a long show left at least 20 grand so far.
[1308.32 --> 1324.72]  Ivan is going to enjoy this water from lttstore.com. Maybe the last water I ever drink.
[1325.68 --> 1330.72]  Maybe, maybe take a trip to the store real quick. Subscribe to float plane. Yeah.
[1332.72 --> 1337.84]  Don't worry guys. You know what though? You know what? I'm good for it. I'm good for it. I am happy to do my
[1337.84 --> 1346.64]  part. I'm I don't typically like, I don't, I don't, I have one investment. It's like something
[1346.64 --> 1353.60]  Yvonne arranged through like our bank because it's like a taxation optimization thing to be clear.
[1354.24 --> 1361.92]  It is optimization, not evasion or even avoidance because what it's doing is it's optimizing the when,
[1362.72 --> 1369.36]  when I will pay the taxes, not, not if. So I have to have, it's like something, something, trust, something,
[1369.36 --> 1377.92]  something. I have to have, uh, like a stocks type investment, um, in order to, anyway, whatever. So I have that.
[1377.92 --> 1383.68]  I don't even know how much it is, but other than that, I own zero crypto. I own zero stocks. The main
[1383.68 --> 1389.60]  reason for stocks is as an influencer. I think it's unethical for me to own stocks, like for realsies. I mean,
[1389.60 --> 1395.12]  this is some, this is some meme right here. This is not, this is not real. This is not real investing.
[1395.68 --> 1402.80]  Um, and then as for crypto, uh, I bought into the hype train more than I probably should have in 2018.
[1403.36 --> 1408.48]  I, I ate it real hard on that one. And I'm just like, you know what? Once bitten, twice shy. I'm gonna
[1408.48 --> 1414.64]  go back to what I always believed in. I always believed in earning money by going out and getting
[1414.64 --> 1419.76]  your hands dirty and maybe not your hands. Maybe it's your, maybe it's your brain writing about
[1419.76 --> 1423.76]  technology muscles, whatever it is. I believe in creating actual value. And I think what we do
[1423.76 --> 1428.96]  creates actual value. We inform people, uh, we entertain people. That's something the world needs.
[1429.52 --> 1437.20]  Um, so this will be, I mean, I'm going to have to get, uh, wealth simple, right? I'm gonna have to
[1437.20 --> 1447.12]  get wealth simple. I think so. Uh, you also know that I don't do this. Yeah, I know, man. Okay.
[1447.60 --> 1454.56]  Okay. So I'm okay. I'm downloading, I'm downloading wealth, simple trade. Uh, okay. So I'm getting that.
[1454.56 --> 1459.60]  We're working on that. I mean, my, I, my, I thought you got, okay. I don't know why I thought this. I
[1459.60 --> 1464.40]  thought it was going to be like double, you know, like a typical, a typical WAN show, um,
[1465.04 --> 1470.08]  super chat hall. So I was thinking like, I don't know, like five grand. Like I thought
[1470.08 --> 1474.64]  I'd be able to do this on my credit card. I think it might, I think you might be touching
[1474.64 --> 1482.32]  50 by the end of the show. Don't encourage them. I'm just, oh, that is a lot. That's not the kind
[1482.32 --> 1491.36]  of thing that I really do. Uh, research firm S3 calculates that short sellers have lost 5 billion
[1491.36 --> 1497.04]  on GameStop so far this year. At least two have seen their stakes completely wiped out.
[1498.00 --> 1504.24]  Um, AMC spiked 260% when trading beyond on Wednesday and hashtag save AMC is trending on
[1504.24 --> 1510.72]  Twitter in a massive upset to the online community of small time buyers, online trading provider,
[1510.72 --> 1516.16]  Robin hood, restricted buying of GME and AMC stocks prompting a swift class action lawsuit. Yeah.
[1516.16 --> 1522.56]  So this is why they were getting review bond and this is why it was justified because basically
[1522.56 --> 1529.20]  the only reason for Robin hood to restrict trading of these stocks is to protect hedge fund jack.
[1529.20 --> 1538.32]  asses. Like, so why that's the only possible logical reason for them to do that. So people are justifiably
[1538.32 --> 1545.28]  mad as especially, do you know about the, like, while the stock was not able to be traded by retail
[1545.28 --> 1550.08]  investors, apparently they were trading back and forth between themselves to lower the price.
[1550.08 --> 1554.96]  Do you know about this? Have you heard about this? Yeah. So that's some pretty disgusting manipulation
[1554.96 --> 1562.80]  right there. Uh, Robin hood has since re enabled trading. Um, and the sec has started to step in
[1562.80 --> 1570.00]  vowing to protect retail investors. Um, yeah, the, the quote doesn't make it sound like that. And there,
[1570.00 --> 1576.24]  there are some things like, I don't, I don't understand it at all. And I might get, uh, I might get
[1576.24 --> 1582.24]  flamed for this, but as far as my under my limited understanding does go, um, there is some amount
[1582.24 --> 1588.48]  of reason for why Robin hood turned things off doing it when they did, uh, Robin hood specifically
[1588.48 --> 1593.84]  turning it off and the other, like highly professional services being able to still
[1593.84 --> 1600.16]  trade was very problematic. There's lots of like bad things that came with it. Um, but for reasons
[1600.16 --> 1606.48]  that I don't understand, Robin hood was like having lots of issues due to, I believe the leverage that
[1606.48 --> 1612.16]  was going on because so many people were diving into it and the like risk that Robin hood was taking
[1612.16 --> 1618.40]  on or something. I don't, I don't understand it, but like it was apparently, um, it was apparently
[1618.40 --> 1623.44]  a big problem for Robin hood. And they required a billion dollar injection of money to stay afloat,
[1623.44 --> 1629.60]  apparently. Yeah. So like they, they were, they were having trouble. Um, now there's been some other
[1629.60 --> 1633.84]  just like kind of meme crap that doesn't really have anything to do with the social movement.
[1633.84 --> 1640.72]  Uh, doge coin spikes, like crazy. It went up like hundreds of percent. Um, uh, I've Elon probably
[1641.52 --> 1647.92]  holds at least some responsibility for that, tweeting some dog magazine meme picture thing.
[1647.92 --> 1652.80]  And then I just want to interject one quick second. I heard about this too. And I forgot to mention it.
[1652.80 --> 1661.28]  Yeah. Apparently Robin hood was selling people's shares, um, like for them. But I, I I've heard,
[1661.28 --> 1666.80]  I've heard two sides of this. Like one guy, apparently they sold 4,500 of his shares for like $118 each.
[1667.36 --> 1675.36]  So he lost like an incredible amount of money. Um, and as far again, this is all like, I've,
[1675.36 --> 1681.76]  I've heard this from like random people. I have no, I don't know, but I've heard that the only shares
[1681.76 --> 1688.64]  that they were selling were shares that were bought on leverage. Got it. I don't, I don't know.
[1688.64 --> 1693.76]  I don't know. I don't know. But yeah, like I think Robin hood was like deep in it. Um,
[1693.76 --> 1701.52]  I don't think it justifies actions, but there was stuff going on there. Um, all right. So what was
[1701.52 --> 1705.36]  I, what was I talking about there for a second? Uh, yeah. Wall street's losing their collective
[1705.36 --> 1710.72]  minds. Right. So there's been some nonsense. Uh, Elon tweeted, uh, or didn't tweet, but just added
[1710.72 --> 1717.52]  Bitcoin to his profile and, uh, people lost their minds. I was actually up replying to emails while this
[1717.52 --> 1724.48]  was happening. I had like Dogecoin up and I had, uh, what, what did I have? Uh, I had coin market
[1724.48 --> 1729.76]  cap up. And so I was just like watching, watching the crypto spikes. I don't own any of it. I still
[1729.76 --> 1734.32]  don't. Uh, but Bitcoin just like shot up 20% in like an hour or something like that. I was like,
[1734.32 --> 1739.12]  what's going on? So I go on Twitter and it's like, Oh, okay. It's Elon again. Actually, it's funny.
[1739.12 --> 1744.80]  Uh, float plane had some really choice words about, uh, Elon talking about not selling things. You
[1744.80 --> 1753.52]  don't have, uh, full, full self driving. Wasn't that promised by a 2020 Elon? Um, yeah. Lots of things.
[1756.00 --> 1762.16]  So, oh, this is, uh, so both chats, by the way, I'm not, I'm not checking YouTube right now,
[1762.16 --> 1768.08]  but Twitch and float plane are both suggesting that you set some form of cap. Um,
[1769.12 --> 1781.20]  I mean, oh man. The only reason why I'm even suggesting it is because both chats are suggesting
[1781.20 --> 1787.84]  it like, yeah, like, and now that I'm saying it like Twitch chat is like cap it, cap it, cap it.
[1787.84 --> 1792.40]  Yes, please cap it, cap it, cap it, cap it, cap it. Okay. All right. I'm going to cap it at 50k.
[1793.20 --> 1798.72]  Okay. That's a lot. I feel like that's, that's, that's cool. I feel like that should be cool.
[1798.72 --> 1808.00]  All right. Okay. Somebody said 69, 420. Yeah. How about 50? Yeah. How about 50? Um,
[1809.12 --> 1814.48]  all right. So in other related news, Google removed negative Robin hood reviews. Um,
[1816.16 --> 1826.24]  this is the whole kind of, kind of thing. Um, some users, so man, what was their Google's policies,
[1826.24 --> 1830.80]  explicitly prohibit reviews intended to manipulate an app's rating. And the company says it has a
[1830.80 --> 1834.64]  system that combines human intelligence with machine learning to detect and enforce policy
[1834.64 --> 1840.48]  violations in ratings and reviews. Uh, James says, so he, he was the one who wrote up this story for
[1840.48 --> 1845.28]  the land show. Isn't every review intended to manipulate an app's rating. And this is a case
[1845.28 --> 1849.44]  where people were actually upset about a legitimate failure of the product to deliver
[1849.44 --> 1856.80]  the functionality that it said it would. Um, Google says it specifically took action on reviews that it
[1856.80 --> 1862.32]  felt confident, violated those policies. And what we don't know is if Google had a high degree of
[1862.32 --> 1869.36]  certainty that a great number of these reviews were created by bots. I have almost no input on this and I
[1869.36 --> 1877.20]  can essentially guarantee you that there was a high amount of those that were bots. Um, I, I also guarantee
[1877.20 --> 1881.52]  you there was a high amount of those that weren't, um, I'm just, I'm just sure there was a ton of
[1881.52 --> 1887.44]  reviews. This was a massive thing and it was seeing the rounds for sure. Yeah. This movement is so much
[1887.44 --> 1892.88]  bigger than it initially appears to be. Like you could look at r slash wall street bets and be like,
[1892.88 --> 1898.00]  oh yeah, it's got like a hundred thousand up votes. This is not a hundred thousand people.
[1898.56 --> 1904.08]  This is like, I was telling Linus a story before the show started. Um, I was having some computer
[1904.08 --> 1908.96]  issues yesterday and I couldn't figure out what it was. And like, it, it felt like, like CPU problems,
[1908.96 --> 1914.08]  but you know how rare those are. And like, there's, it was just weird things I was having trouble with.
[1914.08 --> 1918.96]  Like I was typing in Slack and my text input was delayed, which is always like a really, really bad
[1918.96 --> 1923.52]  sign. I was really trying to figure out what was going on. And then I was like, you know, I wonder if
[1923.52 --> 1929.28]  I'm just getting like overflowed by the wall street bets discord. I left the wall street bets discord and
[1929.28 --> 1935.12]  there was no problems anymore. I didn't even have it open. It was, it was a CPU or something.
[1935.92 --> 1942.96]  Uh, 5960 X. Yeah. Uh, so like, it's, it's not, it's a little old now, but it's not a lightweight by
[1942.96 --> 1948.24]  any means. Like this should have no problem with a discord chat that wasn't even, it wasn't even the
[1948.24 --> 1954.00]  selected discord chat and discord wasn't even like maximized on my screen. It was, it was minimized for
[1954.00 --> 1959.12]  hours. Like I had nothing to do with discord and it was lagging out my computer almost as a whole.
[1959.28 --> 1969.92]  Like, like, holy, I don't know. Oh, people are saying if you set the cap even lower, if you set
[1969.92 --> 1977.76]  the cap at $42,069. That's okay. No, I I'm, I'm a man of my word. I said 50. So that's what we're
[1977.76 --> 1981.68]  doing. I, I, yeah. People are just saying that cause it's even more me, me, but I hear you.
[1981.68 --> 1987.28]  Yeah. That's that's okay. That's okay. I already said it. I already said it. Okay. Okay. Um,
[1987.28 --> 1992.40]  I gotta make some money real quick here if you guys don't mind. So, uh, let's talk about this.
[1992.40 --> 1995.36]  I'm not looking forward to that conversation with Yvonne. She's going to be like,
[1996.64 --> 2001.60]  really? Like, look, this is a movement, hon. She hasn't really been following it. She's been
[2001.60 --> 2008.48]  absolutely swapped at work. It kind of is. I am very ignorant about this subject. Has, has like,
[2008.48 --> 2015.20]  activism investing been a thing before? I don't think we've ever seen anything quite like this,
[2015.20 --> 2021.04]  to my knowledge. Maybe someone in the chat can like speak up because I am very ignorant about
[2021.04 --> 2025.92]  this subject, but it just feels like a first time thing for me personally.
[2026.88 --> 2029.36]  I'm almost certain it's never happened at this kind of scale.
[2031.04 --> 2036.32]  I mean, yeah. Occupy Walls, no. Occupy Wall Street was completely impotent. It had no fangs.
[2036.32 --> 2039.20]  Whereas the only way you can get through to these people.
[2039.20 --> 2040.88]  This has very real fangs.
[2040.88 --> 2046.48]  This has actual fangs. This is completely different. Occupy Wall Street, nobody cared.
[2046.48 --> 2054.32]  Literally nobody cared. There's pictures of like the Wall Street goons, like drinking champagne,
[2054.32 --> 2058.40]  taking pictures of the Occupy protesters and laughing. Like they didn't care.
[2058.40 --> 2064.64]  It meant nothing. I'm sorry. No offense. If you were an Occupy person and you wasted a big chunk of
[2064.64 --> 2072.24]  your life standing around in the street over that, that did nothing. This, this is effective.
[2072.24 --> 2078.48]  Oh my God. This might be a terrible idea or it might be an amazing idea.
[2080.24 --> 2084.80]  If you, if you call Yvonne, let her know you're live on the show and then let her know what's going on.
[2085.60 --> 2087.44]  Fine. Can I please make some money first?
[2088.16 --> 2088.56]  Yes.

[2201.20 --> 2209.60]  Okay. Yeah, yeah. All good. Okay. All right. Let's call the wife. You guys are going on LTT Store,
[2209.60 --> 2214.32]  right? You're buying stuff on LTT Store? A little tidbit that you can maybe share with her is that you are now
[2214.96 --> 2221.44]  potentially the world's biggest gamer because you spent more money at GameStop than you have on your car.
[2221.44 --> 2226.00]  Thanks for that. All right.
[2226.00 --> 2234.24]  I'm just going to... Hey. Hey, so you're live on the WAN show right now. I have some interesting news.
[2234.80 --> 2242.56]  I may have run my mouth a little bit on the show today. So do you like, do we have any means of
[2242.56 --> 2248.56]  buying individual stocks? What do you want to do?
[2248.56 --> 2256.32]  Yeah. Well, I mean, are we set up for it? I know you have that thing for the trust. I don't even know
[2256.32 --> 2259.84]  what it's called. But the thing with the bank. Remember you're live on the show.
[2259.84 --> 2261.84]  Yeah, remember you're live on the show.
[2261.84 --> 2265.36]  I don't have very much money in it. Why?
[2265.36 --> 2269.44]  Yeah, yeah. No, no. I don't mean that thing. I just mean we'd have to use cash. It would be
[2270.00 --> 2275.52]  like cash money. I just mean, do we even have an account with any... Do we have a broker?
[2275.52 --> 2281.68]  We have an account with a bank where I could buy stock online. I have not tried it. It does not
[2281.68 --> 2285.04]  have very much money in it. But we do have something.
[2285.04 --> 2290.40]  Okay. So I have interesting news for you. How hard is it to transfer money into that account?
[2293.84 --> 2299.84]  I don't know. I would have to look into that because I haven't... I've only done it once ever.
[2299.84 --> 2306.16]  Okay, cool. So I need you to put about 50,000 US dollars in that account.
[2306.16 --> 2306.96]  No.
[2306.96 --> 2308.24]  What?
[2308.24 --> 2314.16]  I need you to put about 50,000 US dollars in that account.
[2316.00 --> 2319.44]  Because we need to invest in GameStop.
[2319.44 --> 2320.88]  No.
[2320.88 --> 2321.76]  No.
[2321.76 --> 2325.68]  No, I actually... We actually have to now though because the community gave me money for it.
[2327.68 --> 2334.00]  Yeah. So I... What I said was that I would take all the super chats for the show today and I would
[2334.00 --> 2342.40]  match them and that I would take that number times five. And I have since capped it. I capped it.
[2342.40 --> 2344.88]  So I was actually very responsible if you think about it.
[2344.88 --> 2351.76]  Okay. You know that they shut down certain like buying... I haven't been following the GameStop.
[2351.76 --> 2352.56]  I know. I know.
[2352.56 --> 2356.40]  But I know that they put restrictions on buying that stock. So how are we even going to do that?
[2356.40 --> 2358.96]  No, no. We can. We can here. We can in Canada.
[2360.16 --> 2366.64]  So... So anyway, I've committed... I've committed it at this point. I said I would 5x what they contributed.
[2366.64 --> 2372.08]  And it looks like they're probably going to reach my maximum, which is $10,000 in super chats.
[2372.80 --> 2377.36]  So... Monday, maybe?
[2379.04 --> 2379.92]  Are you serious?
[2379.92 --> 2382.80]  Yeah, I'm serious. I told them I'd do it. You know how it is.
[2384.00 --> 2385.44]  Why do you do things?
[2385.44 --> 2391.44]  I... Well, you know what? Okay. So think about it this way. Think about it this way.
[2391.44 --> 2393.44]  Um...
[2393.92 --> 2400.88]  Our $50,000 could screw over bad people far more than it's costing us.
[2403.44 --> 2403.68]  Um...
[2405.84 --> 2406.24]  Okay.
[2406.24 --> 2408.32]  All right. All right.
[2408.32 --> 2411.84]  I would much rather donate that money to a charity.
[2411.84 --> 2412.64]  Yeah.
[2412.64 --> 2419.20]  Or helping people in need rather than earning rich people, whatever. I don't know. Bad people.
[2419.20 --> 2422.48]  That's fair. But here's another way of thinking about it. Okay.
[2423.28 --> 2432.08]  When the stock falls, which it inevitably will, that money will go to all the small retail investors who cash out.
[2432.64 --> 2435.28]  So it kind of helps people in need if you think about it.
[2440.88 --> 2441.36]  Love you.
[2442.72 --> 2444.00]  Bye. We'll talk to you later.
[2444.00 --> 2446.00]  Okay. Bye.
[2446.64 --> 2446.88]  Bye.
[2446.88 --> 2448.88]  Bye.
[2449.20 --> 2451.04]  Bye.
[2451.04 --> 2451.60]  But, um...
[2451.60 --> 2453.28]  That's not as well as it could've.
[2453.28 --> 2454.72]  But honestly, yeah.
[2454.72 --> 2457.36]  I... She took that a lot better than I expected.
[2457.36 --> 2462.72]  The I will talk to you later is I think the beginning of potentially the real conversation.
[2462.72 --> 2462.96]  Yep.
[2463.60 --> 2466.48]  She's gonna tell me to be slightly more responsible.
[2467.12 --> 2472.16]  So I think the WAN show is potentially why that conversation didn't go too bad.
[2472.16 --> 2475.04]  And now maybe the blow will be a little softer when it happens.
[2475.04 --> 2475.28]  Yeah.
[2475.28 --> 2476.08]  So thanks, audience.
[2476.08 --> 2476.48]  Yeah.
[2476.48 --> 2476.96]  You know what?
[2476.96 --> 2477.68]  That's pretty good.
[2477.68 --> 2477.92]  That's great.
[2477.92 --> 2478.40]  That's pretty good.
[2479.28 --> 2479.68]  All right.
[2480.48 --> 2480.80]  Yep.
[2480.80 --> 2482.00]  Apes together strong.
[2482.00 --> 2483.12]  Thank you, Owen Benner.
[2486.24 --> 2486.72]  All right.
[2486.72 --> 2490.08]  Uh, so why don't we move on and let's talk about something else.
[2490.08 --> 2491.12]  Can we talk about something else?
[2491.12 --> 2491.68]  Yeah.
[2491.68 --> 2492.96]  Let's talk about something else.
[2492.96 --> 2493.36]  Intel.
[2493.36 --> 2494.08]  Sure.
[2494.08 --> 2499.60]  Intel bolsters their engineering leadership with returning technologist Sunil Shanoi and
[2499.60 --> 2500.56]  more.
[2500.56 --> 2503.68]  The Intel hits just keep on playing.
[2503.68 --> 2506.00]  These are classic hits right now.
[2506.00 --> 2509.68]  Pat Gelsinger isn't even CEO until February 15th.
[2509.68 --> 2516.08]  And he has already rehired the 33 year old Intel veteran who left the company in 2014.
[2516.08 --> 2519.68]  Sunil will be senior VP and general manager of the design engineering group.
[2519.68 --> 2522.08]  He holds a master's degree in computer engineering.
[2522.08 --> 2522.80]  That's good.
[2522.80 --> 2525.04]  That's better than like a finance degree.
[2525.04 --> 2526.24]  He has 16.
[2526.24 --> 2527.76]  Do you have an Apple watch on you right now?
[2527.76 --> 2528.00]  Yeah.
[2528.00 --> 2528.40]  What's up?
[2528.40 --> 2529.36]  Are you wearing one?
[2529.36 --> 2530.08]  Is it powered?
[2530.08 --> 2530.32]  Yeah.
[2530.32 --> 2532.48]  Can you check your heart rate?
[2532.48 --> 2535.68]  Oh, uh, I actually, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[2535.68 --> 2536.96]  I don't really know how to do that.
[2537.68 --> 2539.84]  Uh, let me check.
[2539.84 --> 2540.48]  Let me check.
[2540.48 --> 2542.24]  Is it like the, I think it's health.
[2542.24 --> 2543.52]  I think it's an app called health.
[2543.52 --> 2544.16]  I could be wrong.
[2544.16 --> 2544.24]  Yeah.
[2544.24 --> 2546.24]  I just like completely don't even care about it.
[2546.24 --> 2546.48]  Okay.
[2546.48 --> 2546.56]  Yeah.
[2546.56 --> 2547.44]  Here's my heart rate.
[2547.44 --> 2547.68]  Right.
[2547.68 --> 2547.92]  Okay.
[2547.92 --> 2548.48]  We're measuring.
[2548.48 --> 2549.04]  We're measuring.
[2550.48 --> 2551.04]  Um,
[2551.04 --> 2552.88]  let's see how calm he is.
[2552.88 --> 2553.92]  He might be pretty calm.
[2553.92 --> 2554.80]  He might be pretty calm.
[2555.52 --> 2556.56]  I'm at 86.
[2556.56 --> 2560.88]  I feel like for you, that's probably high.
[2560.88 --> 2563.36]  Uh, I think that's a little on the high side for me.
[2563.36 --> 2563.52]  Yeah.
[2563.52 --> 2567.60]  So you can actually, you can see my, you can see my history here.
[2567.60 --> 2570.40]  Oh, well, you were able to see my history, but I took it off and it locked.
[2570.40 --> 2571.20]  Give me one second.
[2572.88 --> 2573.60]  Uh, okay.
[2573.60 --> 2575.20]  So I'm going to the, I'm going to the health app.
[2575.20 --> 2576.48]  Why are we still talking about this?
[2576.48 --> 2576.80]  God.
[2577.52 --> 2580.64]  Uh, yeah, no, actually starting at six o'clock, it looks like,
[2581.28 --> 2583.04]  uh, you can actually see.
[2583.68 --> 2584.08]  Hold on.
[2584.08 --> 2585.20]  Let me just get this adjusted.
[2585.20 --> 2585.36]  Yeah.
[2585.36 --> 2589.20]  You can actually see a spike after six o'clock here.
[2589.92 --> 2594.16]  So if you guys were wondering if this is just a show, um, and I'm like,
[2594.80 --> 2597.44]  ha ha, pretending to be stressed or whatever.
[2597.44 --> 2599.20]  No, it appears that my stress is real.
[2604.64 --> 2604.96]  Sorry.
[2604.96 --> 2605.60]  I just want.
[2605.60 --> 2606.32]  I'll be fine.
[2606.32 --> 2606.96]  I'll be fine.
[2606.96 --> 2607.52]  I'll be fine.
[2608.32 --> 2614.24]  Um, yeah, I, I, I did know that Yvonne's preferences, like, we don't,
[2614.24 --> 2616.16]  we don't really like talk about it much.
[2616.16 --> 2621.68]  Like I've, I've always felt that sort of, uh, holding up a megaphone when you make a charitable
[2621.68 --> 2625.84]  donation is like, uh, it's not my style there.
[2625.84 --> 2626.40]  That's all I'll say.
[2626.40 --> 2627.28]  I'm not going to say what it is.
[2627.28 --> 2629.36]  I'm just going to say that it's not my style.
[2629.36 --> 2629.92]  Yeah.
[2629.92 --> 2635.92]  And I know Yvonne is perfectly comfortable with like spending money, um, to, to help people,
[2636.72 --> 2640.16]  but this is not really like how she likes to do it.
[2640.16 --> 2642.00]  This is not really her jam.
[2642.00 --> 2645.20]  Um, okay.
[2645.20 --> 2651.28]  So Sunil's previous work at Intel includes senior VP and general manager of previous work at Intel.
[2652.80 --> 2657.76]  No, but previous work includes a general manager of sci-fi risk five program.
[2657.76 --> 2658.72]  That's pretty cool.
[2658.72 --> 2663.68]  Corporate VP of Intel's platform engineering group, microprocessor and SOC design across Intel product
[2663.68 --> 2669.12]  groups, visual and parallel computing group lead server and PC, silicon development, Rd and engineering
[2669.12 --> 2673.76]  lead, uh, signals responsibilities will overlap with recently departed Jim Keller.
[2673.76 --> 2679.20]  And outgoing CEO, Bob Swan says, uh, he's a proven engineering leader who has deep experience
[2679.20 --> 2684.80]  in microprocessor and SOC design and R and D. He will return on February 1st, two weeks ahead of
[2684.80 --> 2692.40]  Pat Gelsinger taking the reins. Not only that, but VMware alumni alumnus Guido Appenzeller is also
[2692.40 --> 2699.28]  joining Intel as CTO of the data platforms group. Um, this is freaking awesome. They are like,
[2699.28 --> 2703.36]  actually forming a sports team. Like this is feels like they're going through like
[2703.36 --> 2710.08]  recruiting for a sports team every week. Like big names. And a lot of them are like,
[2710.08 --> 2714.96]  they're, you know, they're bringing the OGs out of retirement. Like it's, this is, this is crazy.
[2714.96 --> 2715.92]  It's really exciting.
[2715.92 --> 2723.92]  Of these hires incoming CEO, Pat Gelsinger says he is quote, not interested in closing the gaps,
[2723.92 --> 2730.48]  but being the unquestioned leader in process technology. You'll see other announcements of key
[2730.48 --> 2736.00]  leaders coming back in. This is sick. This is sick. That's really exciting.
[2736.00 --> 2745.12]  And I'm excited. Not as excited as Apple was to post their all time record revenue in Q1 of over 100
[2745.76 --> 2751.52]  billion dollars. More than half of that was the iPhone with some reporting showing that this iPhone
[2751.52 --> 2756.48]  surge comes from China, which many are speculating demonstrates that China is quite sensitive to design
[2756.48 --> 2760.72]  changes. I don't actually get it. How is it that Apple spends as much on R and D as they do? And
[2760.72 --> 2764.96]  they only change the look of their phone every two or three years. Like I've, I've, I've actually
[2764.96 --> 2770.48]  always found that kind of baffling. I think a lot of it can be like experimental stuff because if they
[2770.48 --> 2774.56]  want to stay on the forefront and like, I mean, if you think about it, we've talked about this on
[2774.56 --> 2780.72]  WAN show before, like a lot of companies will do something and it'll be like, eh, not that great.
[2780.72 --> 2785.28]  And then Apple will do it. And it'll be like, that's good enough for actual market adoption.
[2785.28 --> 2790.64]  And they'll actually drain drive actual change in the industry. So that like doing that as much as
[2790.64 --> 2796.72]  I don't like Apple, I realized that was a lot of Apple pump. Um, doing that probably costs a lot.
[2798.80 --> 2799.84]  It's not too surprising.
[2801.84 --> 2802.56]  Oh man.
[2802.56 --> 2805.44]  Oh man.
[2805.44 --> 2814.08]  Oh man. GME is like peak peak right now. It's at 325, but it's going up in after hours.
[2817.20 --> 2823.28]  I think, hold on. I'm pretty open. Where's the close today? Must be close today. I don't know.
[2823.28 --> 2827.20]  I don't, I don't feel like, I feel like we got, we got to get through this show.
[2827.20 --> 2829.84]  I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm extremely stressed out.
[2829.84 --> 2833.44]  So I understand there are more than a billion active iPhones out in the world,
[2833.44 --> 2837.36]  which is around half of all iPhones ever made. That's kind of crazy if you think about it.
[2837.36 --> 2842.32]  So people are keeping them for quite a while. Mac sales are also up year over year, but down a
[2842.32 --> 2847.04]  bit since last quarter, despite the release of the M1 could be back to school, but also there are
[2847.04 --> 2852.00]  stories of supply constraints. And I think there's a lot of people that are holding out for like
[2852.72 --> 2855.92]  big boy, Apple, so the next one. Yeah. Yeah.
[2855.92 --> 2856.24]  Yeah.
[2856.24 --> 2864.96]  Okay. Uh, Nvidia keeps making upgrades. We can't buy Luke. Do you want to get us through this one?
[2864.96 --> 2872.96]  Allegedly there's been a leak of a 3080 TI 20 gigabyte, uh, Chinese content creator, big hardware
[2872.96 --> 2882.00]  player. I love that leaks, a 30, 80, 20 gigabyte model allegedly gained access to an engineering sample.
[2882.00 --> 2888.48]  Uh, it could be fake. It has some weird GPU Z info, et cetera. Um, but the leaker alleges it's great
[2888.48 --> 2894.16]  for Ethereum mining performance. Um, so if true, you're not going to be able to buy one anyways.
[2895.84 --> 2903.68]  Yeah. Um, laptop memory faster than your desktop memory. Team group has announced their development
[2903.68 --> 2912.64]  of DDR five. So dims 16 gigabytes per module at a speed of 4,800 megahertz at 1.1 volts. Although these
[2912.64 --> 2918.24]  are development dims team group has stated that they are success successfully developed, uh, since
[2918.24 --> 2922.40]  cast latency is always a significant factor with memory. It's interesting to see what these sticks
[2922.40 --> 2929.12]  will be rated at high memory modules could end up not being a big performance improvement. Um, due to,
[2929.12 --> 2940.00]  you know, that, um, yeah. Okay. Please stop, please stop sending money. We're at 10 K. That's it. That's the
[2940.00 --> 2949.60]  limit. I'm not, I'm not doing it. Okay, cool. All right. Yep. Straight to the moon.
[2949.60 --> 2961.92]  Uh, okay. Um, and in other news, the core I nine 11, 900 KF. So this is upcoming a rocket lake
[2961.92 --> 2969.36]  apparently will near a hundred degrees Celsius under load at 4.78 gigahertz leaked screenshots on chip
[2969.36 --> 2975.84]  hell from user enthusiastic citizen stroke monster. That's apparently what Google translates. It's
[2975.84 --> 2980.96]  out. So it's a Chinese username. That's also enthusiastic citizen stroke monster. I actually
[2980.96 --> 2988.16]  kind of love it. Yeah. Shows the package at 98 degrees under load with a 250 watt power consumption.
[2988.80 --> 2995.44]  Uh, according to IDA64 voltage should be around 1.325 volts while CPU Z lists 1.4 and the rumored
[2995.44 --> 3003.28]  specs are eight core 16 thread 4.8 gigahertz all core 5.3 gigahertz single core 125 watt. And remember
[3003.28 --> 3011.60]  that's that base clock all core. The leaked test was run using an entry level 360 millimeter AIO cooler.
[3012.16 --> 3023.52]  360. How is that entry level? Yeah. Uh, this was posted by, um, one of the new writers and there's a bit
[3023.52 --> 3027.36]  of editorializing at the end. It's still technically under TJ Maxx, so it's fine, right?
[3027.36 --> 3034.48]  Yeah. Well, geez, that's, oh, that's some pretty crazy nonsense right there.
[3035.60 --> 3038.00]  Okay. Imagine being able to make ramen on your CPU.
[3038.00 --> 3042.32]  That's it. I've had enough. I've had enough for the day. You guys, um,
[3043.68 --> 3048.00]  if anyone on float plane wants to kind of like advise a good time to,
[3048.00 --> 3056.80]  uh, to, to, um, whatever it's called to like actually place the order for the stocks,
[3057.44 --> 3062.64]  that would be great. Just like, let, let me know, like, is there an optimal time, like right before
[3062.64 --> 3067.52]  or if you're Canadian and something, yeah. If you're Canadian and just like know how to do it,
[3067.52 --> 3073.04]  let me know. Um, I'm, I'm jazzed that we're participating. The number of people-
[3073.04 --> 3076.16]  I would also like to put out there that the hiring positions are still a thing.
[3076.16 --> 3083.52]  So do not concern yourself. Um, keep applying. There's multiple jobs up right now. There's a,
[3083.52 --> 3090.08]  there's a contract position for designer. There's a, uh, full-time position for a developer,
[3090.08 --> 3097.12]  specifically, mostly for helping with the LTT store, but also for other things. And I'm trying to,
[3097.92 --> 3103.12]  be nice to the other people that have jobs posted as well. There's a full-time bookkeeper or
[3103.12 --> 3110.48]  accountant. Um, there's a full-time video editor and camera operator. Uh, and that might be,
[3110.48 --> 3115.12]  there's also a full-time junior design and manufacturing engineer for creator warehouse,
[3115.12 --> 3120.72]  a full-time retail product and inventory manager. Uh, and that's, that's it. So there's a bunch of job
[3120.72 --> 3125.76]  postings right now. Those are still a thing. Um, apply and come work for very cool teams.
[3127.52 --> 3135.76]  Golic says wealth, simple 10 AM Monday morning. Someone says limit by at 8 30 AM central time.
[3135.76 --> 3139.92]  I don't even know what, what is the limit by, uh,
[3139.92 --> 3143.60]  there's an ex Shopify dev in chat here that applied. Well, that's pretty legit.
[3144.88 --> 3148.72]  Okay. Fantastic. Cool.
[3151.44 --> 3152.00]  Um,
[3152.00 --> 3160.72]  you can put the order in once the money is in your account to buy with a limit of the price,
[3161.36 --> 3170.96]  just that open price tends to spike. So that lets you buy close to the open limit to a price that is
[3170.96 --> 3178.32]  not a big open spike. Okay. Um, okay. All right. Uh,
[3179.12 --> 3185.44]  Mortino says I used to date Yvonne's sister and Linus has done dumber when they had no money.
[3185.44 --> 3190.08]  She didn't leave him. I actually don't believe that. I don't believe you. What is your name,
[3190.08 --> 3194.96]  Mortino? Because I would probably remember you. And I actually don't think I've ever done anything
[3194.96 --> 3200.64]  even close to this stupid. I'm pretty responsible with my money. This is pretty astronomical. Yeah.
[3200.64 --> 3204.48]  I think I would also like to put on the record that I tried to make it not as bad.
[3205.92 --> 3211.28]  That's true. You did. There was an audible poll. We had agreed at two X and there was an audible
[3211.28 --> 3217.36]  poll for five X mid show. Yeah. Um, yeah.
[3217.36 --> 3225.36]  Okay. So limit is a set price by you market is whatever price it is when you're trading. So I
[3225.36 --> 3228.64]  think you could say, I understand what that means. Cause if I'm making a really big buy,
[3228.64 --> 3233.04]  it could actually drive my own price up. Whereas if I just let it trickle,
[3234.00 --> 3239.04]  if I let the, the buy kind of trickle, then I can't, you didn't say how you were going to buy them.
[3239.04 --> 3245.04]  So you can buy them in a variety of ways. You could also buy them in like chunks maybe or something.
[3245.04 --> 3248.40]  I don't know. Oh,
[3251.36 --> 3255.60]  Holy crap. Okay. Um,
[3258.40 --> 3262.40]  man, she's just, she's going to come home and be like, what the actual
[3264.32 --> 3271.44]  you could, uh, you could dodge it by still being live by playing video games as an after party.
[3271.44 --> 3275.28]  That's true. That's probably not a terrible idea right now.
[3276.88 --> 3281.52]  Um, you know, it's funny. There's, this has generated so much interest in like stocks in
[3281.52 --> 3285.52]  general. The number of people that I've had reaching out and asking if Linus media group
[3285.52 --> 3292.08]  is going to go public is insane this week. The answer is no. And the reason is that
[3292.08 --> 3299.20]  the same reason it was, yeah, the same reason it was before I, I like, I don't want to, I don't want
[3299.20 --> 3306.24]  to be accountable to like a board of directors. If I decide to blow, you know, or have to deal with
[3306.24 --> 3306.96]  a bunch of money.
[3306.96 --> 3308.00]  A bunch of money.
[3308.00 --> 3314.08]  Multiple billion dollar, multiple, multiple, multiple billion dollar companies deciding to short your
[3314.08 --> 3320.08]  company for fun and potentially the, the Reddit police not going, we, we, we, we and saving you.
[3322.08 --> 3326.64]  There's risk. There's like, there's also the fact that I kind of look at any transaction. I go like,
[3326.64 --> 3330.72]  what's in it for both sides. I don't understand what's in it for you because I have no intention
[3330.72 --> 3335.68]  of paying any dividends anytime soon. Uh, we're going to be reinvesting very heavily back into the
[3335.68 --> 3341.68]  company probably pretty soon here. Um, so it's like, there's nothing in it for you. Uh, what's in
[3341.68 --> 3347.04]  it for me is obviously having like more money to grow the company, but I think every transaction
[3347.04 --> 3360.00]  should be, should be two sided. So, um, guys, uh, all I'll say, all I'll say is LTT store.com. Um,
[3360.00 --> 3368.88]  um, thanks, you know, underwear, underwear, you can buy me some new underwear at this point.
[3370.56 --> 3371.28]  You might need them.
[3371.28 --> 3381.20]  Oh, Paul says worst case, you can use the loss for tax deduction. Yeah. A lot of people talk about
[3381.20 --> 3386.88]  like tax deductibility as if it's some kind of like magic bandaid. You still lost the money.
[3386.88 --> 3397.92]  Yeah. You just pay less tax on other money that you did have to make. Like it's, it's not magic. Um,
[3398.96 --> 3404.88]  it does. I mean, it, it helps you still got burned, but maybe it's a little bit of a salve. I don't know.
[3405.84 --> 3412.96]  Yeah. Let's, let's see what we can do here. Um, yeah, there's just, okay.
[3412.96 --> 3420.96]  Okay. Okay. What is an options contract? That's apparently how deep value made his millions.
[3421.68 --> 3425.60]  I don't even know. I don't, I don't think it's going to continue to go up like crazy like that anyway.
[3427.04 --> 3435.76]  Okay. I'm going to go, I'm going to go face the music. Thank you very much you guys for contributing
[3435.76 --> 3443.12]  to this, I guess. Uh, if you want to stream some games and pretend potentially continue to, uh,
[3443.76 --> 3454.08]  make money, I'm around. Yeah. All right. Cool. Um, duly noted. Good luck. Okay. Thanks for,
[3454.08 --> 3458.64]  thanks for watching the show guys. See you next week. Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3458.64 --> 3460.64]  Bye.
[3469.68 --> 3474.16]  Mortino. Oh, this is great. Mortino who claimed to have dated Yvonne's sister says,
[3474.16 --> 3480.08]  oof, called out. I meant situationally. You have money now you didn't before. And I'm only working
[3480.08 --> 3486.64]  on what I heard, not facts to be honest. I see. Still didn't hear a name. Yeah. I still didn't hear a name, bro.
[3488.64 --> 3502.08]  Linus was pretty freaking cheap when I met him. Still is in a lot of ways. Thanks for that.
[3502.08 --> 3507.12]  I don't know. I have a, I don't mean it as an insult. It's coming from me. I don't mean that as an insult.
[3507.12 --> 3513.60]  Yeah. That's true. That's a, that's a show of respect from you. Yeah. I wouldn't take it that way.
[3513.60 --> 3517.60]  Um, so I don't know. I have a pretty hard time believing that. All right. Good night, everybody.
