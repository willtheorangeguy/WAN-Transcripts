[0.88 --> 7.92]  What's up y'all welcome to the WAN show we're gonna have a fantastic fantastic show for you guys today
[7.92 --> 17.28]  I saw a conspiracy theory that the only way that I could have had such a bad take on the RTX 3080 Ti
[17.28 --> 24.44]  Was to generate more views when I inevitably had to apologize for how bad my review was
[24.44 --> 29.48]  So this is where those views are gonna come from this tell your friends get them on the WAN show
[29.48 --> 32.32]  Let's go let's go let's get some views
[32.32 --> 35.12]  Because we're gonna be we're gonna be talking about it
[35.12 --> 39.34]  We're gonna be talking about our largely positive review of the RTX 3080 Ti
[39.34 --> 43.98]  When the vast majority of the rest of the tech press said it was
[43.98 --> 48.66]  Not a very good bargain
[48.66 --> 56.38]  Okay, yeah, we're pull. Oh, we're gonna dig right into that in other news AMD's Computex keynote was
[56.38 --> 64.38]  Awesome and there's a lot to discuss about how much sweet technology AMD has coming down the pipe
[64.38 --> 65.72]  What else we got today?
[66.02 --> 68.44]  The leaked CD project red code
[68.44 --> 71.06]  Uh, or sorry, I should say data
[71.06 --> 73.90]  Uh, was sort of made public sort of
[73.90 --> 83.72]  Uh, the source code for CD uh, cyberpunk 2077 the source code for red engine the source code for witcher 3 the source code for thronebreaker and all this other stuff all
[83.72 --> 86.72]  Wow, but it's essentially all password protected
[86.72 --> 91.72]  Um, so we'll see, uh, how strong that is
[91.72 --> 92.18]  Got it
[92.18 --> 95.40]  Also, as vaguely as I can possibly go
[95.40 --> 97.84]  Huawei goes its own way
[97.84 --> 99.28]  Goes its own way
[99.28 --> 100.54]  That's funny
[100.54 --> 102.02]  That's a fun
[102.02 --> 103.60]  That's a funny play on that
[103.60 --> 104.60]  That's a joke
[104.60 --> 105.40]  I like it
[105.40 --> 106.20]  Good joke
[106.20 --> 106.76]  Good joke
[106.76 --> 107.04]  Yeah
[107.04 --> 108.32]  Let's roll that intro
[108.32 --> 109.24]  Yeah
[109.24 --> 133.32]  Oops, I'm supposed to be doing something
[133.32 --> 137.24]  Uh, right, right
[137.24 --> 140.48]  We have, um, sponsors, uh, like this one
[140.48 --> 141.50]  Seasonic
[141.50 --> 143.18]  Ridge Wallet
[143.18 --> 145.38]  TuxCare
[145.38 --> 147.34]  That's good stuff
[147.34 --> 148.36]  Alright
[148.36 --> 152.12]  Naturally, we're gonna have to jump right into the biggest
[152.12 --> 153.46]  Meatiest
[153.46 --> 155.40]  Most delicious topic
[155.40 --> 156.80]  Of the day
[156.80 --> 160.88]  And that is, of course, the backlash we faced over our review
[160.88 --> 163.66]  Of the RTX 3080 Ti
[163.66 --> 165.78]  And, man, there's a lot of
[165.78 --> 169.02]  Everyone, even internally, is getting in on this one
[169.02 --> 170.36]  This is in the WAN Show doc
[170.36 --> 172.22]  Uh, Anthony prepared it
[172.22 --> 175.70]  Of course, as you guys know, Anthony is our GPU editor
[175.70 --> 177.98]  So he was the one who benchmarked the cards
[177.98 --> 179.94]  And actually wrote the bulk of the review
[179.94 --> 182.56]  He and I sat down together, as we always do
[182.56 --> 183.74]  And talked through it
[183.74 --> 187.98]  We were both happy with, uh, with what we had put out there
[187.98 --> 191.02]  And, uh, of course, you guys did not agree so much
[191.02 --> 192.70]  But even Riley's getting in on it
[192.70 --> 194.72]  He's got comments in the doc
[194.72 --> 197.42]  He's like, hey, make sure you emphasize this part
[197.42 --> 199.10]  So, let's go through it
[199.10 --> 202.76]  Our review of the RTX 3080 Ti was largely positive
[202.76 --> 205.92]  Based on our position for the card
[205.92 --> 210.80]  Which is that it's pretty much a cheaper version of the RTX 3090
[210.80 --> 215.84]  Which, if you guys remember, had an MSRP of $1,500 US dollars
[215.84 --> 218.74]  And it's not like this is based on nothing
[218.74 --> 222.66]  All of its core specifications are within 2.5% of the 3090
[222.66 --> 224.22]  Except for the frame buffer size
[224.22 --> 225.80]  Which is half
[225.80 --> 227.30]  And we talked about this in the video
[227.30 --> 229.58]  The fact that it has half the frame buffer
[229.58 --> 231.06]  Means that if for whatever reason
[231.06 --> 234.50]  Like, say, for example, a global silicon shortage
[234.50 --> 236.28]  Um, NVIDIA was having trouble
[236.28 --> 238.46]  Getting enough of the GDDR6X memory
[238.46 --> 240.24]  That they need to put on the board
[240.24 --> 243.50]  They would be able to make twice as many 3080 Ti's
[243.50 --> 246.36]  Compared to how many 3090's they could build
[246.36 --> 250.88]  Performance testing put it at or above the RTX 3090
[250.88 --> 251.98]  In most scenarios
[251.98 --> 254.98]  So, um, our takeaway was that
[254.98 --> 259.90]  Yeah, it sucks that it's more expensive than the RX 6900 XT
[259.90 --> 262.64]  But it's still a good value
[262.64 --> 263.76]  Hold on
[263.76 --> 265.38]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
[265.38 --> 266.54]  Luke, stop
[266.54 --> 266.70]  Relax
[266.70 --> 267.52]  Just relax
[267.52 --> 268.24]  Everyone relax
[268.24 --> 269.72]  Good value
[269.72 --> 271.30]  You have to listen to the rest of the sentence
[271.30 --> 275.38]  For anyone who was looking at the RTX 3090 for gaming
[275.38 --> 276.12]  And
[276.12 --> 276.58]  To be clear
[276.58 --> 279.46]  That doesn't mean for everyone
[279.46 --> 282.24]  I want you to reanalyze that sentence for a moment
[282.24 --> 283.12]  Okay
[283.12 --> 285.92]  People that were already shopping for a 3090
[285.92 --> 286.56]  Yes
[286.56 --> 287.88]  This is a good value
[287.88 --> 290.86]  We also framed it as a good value
[290.86 --> 292.36]  If you can get it at MSRP
[292.36 --> 294.34]  During the scalpocalypse
[294.34 --> 296.00]  Okay
[296.00 --> 297.32]  This sentiment
[297.32 --> 298.56]  Was
[298.56 --> 299.94]  Not shared
[299.94 --> 302.10]  By the entire tech community
[302.10 --> 305.60]  Gamers Nexus claimed the card was a waste of money
[305.60 --> 308.40]  Saying gamers were being robbed blind
[308.40 --> 310.04]  Alright, that's the quote
[310.04 --> 314.12]  They even announced that they left the keynote early in disgust
[314.12 --> 317.18]  Hardware Unboxed called it a shameless money grab
[317.18 --> 319.22]  Saying Nvidia failed to read the room
[319.22 --> 322.80]  Hardware Canucks proclaimed that the 3080 Ti was not
[322.80 --> 324.44]  A new hope for gamers
[324.44 --> 325.48]  But
[325.48 --> 326.56]  Okay, why?
[327.74 --> 328.72]  As it turns out
[328.72 --> 335.02]  People thought the RTX 3080 Ti was going to be more similar to an RTX 3080
[335.02 --> 337.50]  And that it would be priced accordingly
[337.50 --> 338.78]  Not only that
[338.78 --> 344.88]  But the perception is that these GPUs would otherwise be destined for RTX 3080s
[344.88 --> 347.16]  And what's happening is
[347.16 --> 351.48]  Rather than taking 3090s and making more of them
[351.48 --> 356.12]  Nvidia is taking what would have been 3080s and marking them up
[356.12 --> 357.46]  So as a result
[357.46 --> 362.90]  Reviewers have pointed out that the performance is a mere 7 to 10% better than the RTX 3080
[362.90 --> 366.00]  For a hefty double the MSRP
[366.00 --> 366.98]  Almost
[366.98 --> 369.86]  So it's $1,200 versus $700
[369.86 --> 377.56]  That looks an awful lot like the scalping behavior that we and other tech outlets have decried
[377.56 --> 379.88]  Over the last months
[379.88 --> 386.12]  But the problem is that it is not a beefed up 3080
[386.12 --> 390.30]  It is a very ever so slightly nerfed 3090
[390.30 --> 393.26]  Both of those cards, the 3080 and the 3090
[393.26 --> 395.60]  Do use a GA102 GPU
[395.60 --> 398.48]  But they are not entirely the same thing
[398.48 --> 402.72]  And we've already had the conversation about the RTX 3090's pricing
[402.72 --> 404.34]  It is really high
[404.34 --> 406.64]  And it was really high before
[406.64 --> 409.40]  And the intention which has been
[409.40 --> 414.20]  The rumors have been swirling about a 3080 Ti for months
[414.20 --> 417.80]  The intention was clearly to plug the massive gap
[417.80 --> 420.50]  That AMD's RX 6900 XT
[420.50 --> 422.30]  Blew in Nvidia's lineup
[422.30 --> 425.04]  Coming in at $999
[425.04 --> 427.62]  Okay, so there's all of that
[427.62 --> 428.72]  And actually, you know what?
[428.72 --> 429.84]  I'm not quite done with that
[429.84 --> 432.34]  Because Gamers Nexus, I love Steve
[432.34 --> 435.96]  But saying gamers are being robbed blind
[435.96 --> 437.52]  Is
[437.52 --> 440.86]  Sort of implies that they are being robbed
[440.86 --> 444.66]  You don't have to give Nvidia your money
[444.66 --> 449.58]  And in fact, if you are a price sensitive buyer
[449.58 --> 452.06]  I would go as far as to say
[452.06 --> 454.48]  That you should not be shopping
[454.48 --> 456.18]  For a top tier
[456.18 --> 457.46]  Absolute
[457.46 --> 459.08]  Highest spec
[459.08 --> 460.42]  GPU
[460.42 --> 462.98]  Which to me, this is
[462.98 --> 465.50]  It matches the performance of the 3090
[465.50 --> 468.06]  Why are you
[468.06 --> 470.62]  Why are you even having this conversation?
[470.62 --> 472.98]  This is clearly a Halo part
[472.98 --> 474.34]  And a $1200
[474.34 --> 475.34]  12
[475.34 --> 476.02]  Like
[476.02 --> 477.08]  $1250
[477.08 --> 478.20]  Or whatever it worked out to
[478.20 --> 480.32]  A $12, $1300 price point
[480.32 --> 481.04]  For a top
[481.04 --> 482.14]  Top spec
[482.14 --> 483.66]  Absolute top of the line GPU
[483.66 --> 484.62]  Is
[484.62 --> 485.76]  Hardly
[485.76 --> 486.88]  A new concept
[486.88 --> 488.30]  Even before
[488.30 --> 490.36]  There was a worldwide silicon shortage
[490.36 --> 491.72]  So it's like
[491.72 --> 492.64]  Yeah
[492.64 --> 493.92]  Sure, fine
[493.92 --> 495.58]  It's not a great bang for the buck
[495.58 --> 497.14]  Was it
[497.14 --> 498.54]  Ever going to be
[498.54 --> 500.84]  When was the last time
[500.84 --> 501.72]  We had an
[501.72 --> 503.46]  80Ti
[503.46 --> 504.10]  Card
[504.10 --> 505.74]  That was like
[505.74 --> 507.46]  Bang for the buck
[507.46 --> 508.94]  Hold on a second
[508.94 --> 510.40]  I'm gonna check something real quick
[510.40 --> 511.72]  2080Ti
[511.72 --> 512.80]  MSRP
[512.80 --> 514.56]  At launch
[514.56 --> 515.92]  Just curious
[515.92 --> 520.52]  So the 2080Ti launched at $999 plus
[520.52 --> 523.30]  Okay
[523.30 --> 526.26]  On Nvidia.com
[526.26 --> 528.46]  I just hope this isn't
[528.46 --> 531.60]  I hope this isn't
[531.60 --> 532.26]  ENUS
[532.26 --> 533.70]  Yeah, and on Nvidia.com
[533.70 --> 535.06]  The latest pricing for
[535.06 --> 536.40]  For a Founders Edition
[536.40 --> 536.94]  Because remember
[536.94 --> 537.58]  Founders Edition
[537.58 --> 538.90]  Is not necessarily
[538.90 --> 540.00]  The lowest price variant
[540.00 --> 541.20]  A Founders Edition
[541.20 --> 542.54]  Is $1200
[542.54 --> 543.76]  So
[543.76 --> 544.60]  Yeah
[544.60 --> 545.26]  It's
[545.26 --> 547.00]  Not a great deal
[547.00 --> 548.60]  But what did you guys think
[548.60 --> 549.68]  Was going to happen
[549.68 --> 550.86]  That Nvidia
[550.86 --> 552.32]  Was going to somehow
[552.32 --> 553.02]  I mean
[553.02 --> 554.30]  They've had earnings calls
[554.30 --> 555.52]  They've had investor calls
[555.52 --> 556.22]  They've said
[556.22 --> 557.26]  This shortage
[557.26 --> 558.86]  Is going to last
[558.86 --> 560.42]  Throughout the rest of this year
[560.42 --> 562.08]  So did you think
[562.08 --> 563.36]  That they had somehow
[563.36 --> 564.56]  Managed to
[564.56 --> 566.80]  Magically
[566.80 --> 567.36]  Find
[567.36 --> 568.50]  More supply
[568.50 --> 569.64]  And
[569.64 --> 570.54]  That like
[570.72 --> 572.06]  This was going to
[572.06 --> 573.04]  Be the new hope
[573.04 --> 573.58]  For gamers
[573.58 --> 574.54]  As hardware canucks
[574.54 --> 575.32]  Thought it might be
[575.32 --> 576.12]  What new hope
[576.12 --> 576.70]  For gamers
[576.70 --> 578.52]  Nvidia has already
[578.52 --> 579.36]  Come out publicly
[579.36 --> 579.88]  And said
[579.88 --> 581.10]  There's no new hope
[581.10 --> 581.66]  For gamers
[581.66 --> 583.92]  Yeah
[583.92 --> 585.64]  So it's like
[585.64 --> 585.96]  Yeah
[585.96 --> 586.90]  That sucks
[586.90 --> 588.78]  That really sucks
[588.78 --> 590.80]  But why are you
[590.80 --> 591.90]  Shooting the messenger here
[591.90 --> 593.30]  I don't really understand it
[593.30 --> 594.62]  There have been
[594.62 --> 596.18]  Some ADTI launches
[596.18 --> 596.88]  Like the
[596.88 --> 597.60]  The 1080Ti
[597.60 --> 598.40]  Was actually like
[598.40 --> 599.20]  If I'm wrong correctly
[599.20 --> 600.10]  Pretty strong
[600.10 --> 601.26]  For bang for the buck
[601.26 --> 603.04]  But I don't think
[603.04 --> 603.90]  That's a
[603.90 --> 605.04]  Normality
[605.04 --> 606.36]  So 1080Ti
[606.36 --> 608.08]  Is an interesting one
[608.08 --> 608.48]  Because
[608.48 --> 610.36]  It used
[610.36 --> 611.64]  The same GPU
[611.64 --> 612.64]  As the Titan
[612.64 --> 613.68]  Of that generation
[613.68 --> 614.42]  And launched
[614.42 --> 615.26]  However
[615.26 --> 616.34]  I forget how many months
[616.34 --> 616.78]  Later
[616.78 --> 617.80]  Than the 1080
[617.80 --> 618.58]  But it was based
[618.58 --> 619.26]  On a completely
[619.26 --> 620.42]  Different GPU
[620.42 --> 621.14]  Yeah
[621.14 --> 622.04]  Nvidia
[622.04 --> 624.04]  I'm trying to remember
[624.04 --> 625.88]  Because there was that
[625.88 --> 626.74]  There was that trend
[626.74 --> 627.50]  For a while
[627.50 --> 628.02]  Where
[628.02 --> 629.06]  Ever since
[629.06 --> 630.48]  From Maxwell
[630.48 --> 631.36]  On
[631.36 --> 632.52]  We were
[632.52 --> 633.22]  For a little while
[633.22 --> 633.96]  We were getting
[633.96 --> 634.84]  No
[634.84 --> 635.72]  Because 680
[635.72 --> 637.12]  Was whatever
[637.12 --> 637.76]  04
[637.76 --> 639.72]  And then 780
[639.72 --> 640.70]  Was
[640.70 --> 642.02]  The top
[642.02 --> 643.86]  The largest die
[643.86 --> 645.42]  And then 980
[645.42 --> 646.72]  Was back to the
[646.72 --> 647.86]  Smaller die again
[647.86 --> 648.72]  And
[648.72 --> 649.78]  Then the TIs
[649.78 --> 650.72]  Have always been
[650.72 --> 651.38]  Based on the
[651.38 --> 652.08]  Largest die
[652.08 --> 652.82]  In the particular
[652.82 --> 654.22]  Architectural family
[654.22 --> 654.90]  So
[654.90 --> 656.70]  You can kind of
[656.70 --> 657.32]  You can kind of
[657.32 --> 658.02]  Go back in
[658.02 --> 658.84]  Nvidia's history
[658.84 --> 659.94]  And find examples
[659.94 --> 660.76]  To prove
[660.76 --> 661.84]  Either point
[661.84 --> 663.26]  What I'm trying to say
[663.26 --> 663.80]  Is that
[663.80 --> 664.44]  This is not
[664.44 --> 665.18]  Without precedent
[665.18 --> 666.30]  At
[666.30 --> 667.24]  All
[667.24 --> 668.48]  So
[668.48 --> 669.78]  1080 Ti's
[669.78 --> 670.54]  MSRP at launch
[670.54 --> 671.04]  Was actually
[671.04 --> 671.74]  $700
[671.74 --> 672.50]  Yes
[672.50 --> 674.02]  And that was
[674.02 --> 675.02]  The top performance
[675.02 --> 675.80]  Card at the time
[675.80 --> 676.34]  Yep
[676.34 --> 677.96]  So anyway
[677.96 --> 678.34]  Hold on
[678.34 --> 678.64]  Let's
[678.64 --> 679.46]  Keep going
[679.46 --> 679.76]  But like I was saying
[679.76 --> 680.76]  It's not necessarily
[680.76 --> 681.44]  A normality
[681.44 --> 682.34]  Just because there is
[682.34 --> 682.86]  One that you can
[682.86 --> 683.24]  Point at
[683.24 --> 683.78]  Doesn't necessarily
[683.78 --> 684.12]  Mean that it
[684.12 --> 684.80]  Happens all the time
[684.80 --> 685.88]  So
[685.88 --> 686.82]  Okay
[686.82 --> 688.00]  Moving on
[688.00 --> 689.10]  A little bit here
[689.10 --> 690.52]  To the concept
[690.52 --> 691.64]  Of MSRP
[691.64 --> 692.46]  Itself
[692.46 --> 693.06]  What an
[693.06 --> 694.54]  MSRP is
[694.54 --> 695.34]  Is a
[695.34 --> 696.36]  Manufacturer
[696.36 --> 697.78]  Suggested retail
[697.78 --> 698.20]  Price
[698.20 --> 699.50]  And I don't expect
[699.50 --> 700.48]  Our average viewer
[700.48 --> 701.22]  To have this
[701.22 --> 701.90]  Context
[701.90 --> 702.74]  But
[702.74 --> 704.20]  Nvidia's
[704.20 --> 705.00]  Manufacturer
[705.00 --> 706.04]  Suggested retail
[706.04 --> 706.50]  Prices
[706.50 --> 707.86]  Are sort of
[707.86 --> 708.28]  A big load
[708.28 --> 708.58]  Of bull
[708.58 --> 709.96]  And there's
[709.96 --> 710.42]  A couple of
[710.42 --> 711.12]  Reasons for that
[711.12 --> 711.94]  So number one
[711.94 --> 712.60]  Is that
[712.60 --> 712.96]  Nvidia
[718.00 --> 718.76]  What's a
[718.76 --> 719.60]  Manufacturer
[719.60 --> 720.68]  Suggested retail
[720.68 --> 721.16]  Price
[721.16 --> 721.66]  From someone
[721.66 --> 722.28]  Who doesn't
[722.28 --> 722.96]  Actually
[722.96 --> 724.00]  Manufacture
[724.00 --> 725.08]  Anything
[725.08 --> 726.52]  TSMC
[726.52 --> 727.30]  Makes the
[727.30 --> 727.72]  Dyes
[727.72 --> 729.60]  Micron
[729.60 --> 729.86]  Or
[729.86 --> 730.48]  Samsung
[730.48 --> 731.60]  Makes the
[731.60 --> 732.16]  DRAM
[732.16 --> 732.92]  Or whoever
[732.92 --> 733.30]  Else
[733.30 --> 736.00]  Someone like
[736.00 --> 737.96]  Foxconn
[737.96 --> 739.22]  Is going to
[739.22 --> 739.76]  Make the
[739.76 --> 740.26]  Actual
[740.26 --> 740.94]  Boards
[740.94 --> 741.68]  I know
[741.68 --> 742.44]  Cooler Master
[742.44 --> 742.98]  Is heavily
[742.98 --> 743.56]  Involved in
[743.56 --> 743.88]  OEM
[743.88 --> 744.70]  Manufacturing
[744.70 --> 745.46]  Of things
[745.46 --> 745.82]  Like
[745.82 --> 746.62]  Coolers
[746.62 --> 747.74]  In some
[747.74 --> 748.24]  Cases
[748.24 --> 748.76]  GPU
[748.76 --> 749.40]  Coolers
[749.40 --> 750.72]  Nvidia
[750.72 --> 751.44]  Actually
[751.44 --> 752.60]  Manufactures
[752.60 --> 753.98]  Nothing
[753.98 --> 754.66]  They contract
[754.66 --> 755.12]  Everything
[755.12 --> 755.64]  Which doesn't
[755.64 --> 756.16]  Mean that they
[756.16 --> 756.60]  Don't have
[756.60 --> 757.90]  Great technology
[757.90 --> 758.56]  Or that they
[758.56 --> 759.22]  Don't have
[759.22 --> 759.70]  A role
[759.70 --> 760.30]  To play
[760.30 --> 760.88]  In the
[760.88 --> 761.44]  In the
[761.44 --> 761.94]  Pricing
[761.94 --> 762.28]  Of
[762.28 --> 763.20]  Products
[763.20 --> 763.78]  Based on
[763.78 --> 763.92]  Their
[763.92 --> 764.54]  Technology
[764.54 --> 765.44]  But what
[765.44 --> 766.06]  It means
[766.06 --> 767.14]  Is that
[767.14 --> 769.58]  They actually
[769.58 --> 770.32]  Don't have
[770.32 --> 770.76]  To give
[770.76 --> 770.88]  A
[770.88 --> 772.32]  If any
[772.32 --> 773.02]  Money gets
[773.02 --> 773.38]  Made
[773.38 --> 773.64]  At
[773.64 --> 774.20]  MSRP
[774.20 --> 775.40]  Because where
[775.40 --> 775.84]  Nvidia
[776.62 --> 777.94]  Is in
[777.94 --> 778.72]  The sale
[778.72 --> 779.46]  Of the
[779.46 --> 780.48]  GPUs
[780.48 --> 780.84]  And I
[780.84 --> 781.28]  Believe
[781.28 --> 782.14]  The memory
[782.14 --> 782.94]  Is usually
[782.94 --> 783.72]  Included
[783.72 --> 784.62]  As part
[784.62 --> 785.26]  Of the
[785.26 --> 785.78]  Package
[785.78 --> 786.40]  That Nvidia
[786.40 --> 787.46]  Allocates
[787.46 --> 787.80]  To their
[787.80 --> 788.12]  Various
[788.12 --> 788.42]  Board
[788.42 --> 788.82]  Partners
[788.82 --> 789.62]  Nvidia
[789.62 --> 789.96]  Makes
[789.96 --> 790.18]  Their
[790.18 --> 790.38]  Money
[790.38 --> 790.94]  At
[790.94 --> 791.34]  Actually
[791.34 --> 791.54]  An

[792.98 --> 793.12]  The
[793.12 --> 793.60]  Stream
[793.60 --> 794.48]  And
[794.48 --> 794.64]  It's
[794.64 --> 794.86]  Only
[794.86 --> 795.12]  With
[795.12 --> 795.32]  The
[795.32 --> 795.78]  Most

[797.14 --> 797.64]  Founders
[797.64 --> 798.08]  Editions
[798.08 --> 798.30]  That
[798.30 --> 798.60]  Nvidia
[798.60 --> 798.82]  Has
[798.82 --> 799.06]  Even
[799.06 --> 799.42]  Gotten

[817.64 --> 819.02]  Is
[819.02 --> 820.08]  Ridiculous

[827.30 --> 828.08]  Doesn't

[1726.20 --> 1726.46]  Point
[1726.46 --> 1726.72]  I
[1726.72 --> 1726.96]  Also
[1726.96 --> 1727.48]  Understand
[1727.48 --> 1727.72]  If
[1727.72 --> 1727.84]  You
[1727.84 --> 1728.08]  Can
[1728.08 --> 1728.30]  Even
[1728.30 --> 1728.54]  Meet
[1728.54 --> 1728.68]  The
[1728.68 --> 1729.20]  Demand
[1729.20 --> 1729.52]  For
[1729.52 --> 1729.84]  Your
[1729.84 --> 1730.56]  RTX
[1730.56 --> 1731.36]  3090
[1731.36 --> 1732.64]  You
[1732.64 --> 1732.76]  Know
[1732.76 --> 1733.18]  Why
[1733.18 --> 1733.36]  Are
[1733.36 --> 1733.68]  You
[1733.68 --> 1736.52]  Why
[1736.52 --> 1736.66]  Are
[1736.66 --> 1736.78]  You
[1736.78 --> 1737.12]  Releasing
[1737.12 --> 1737.36]  More
[1737.36 --> 1737.78]  Products
[1737.78 --> 1737.92]  And
[1737.92 --> 1738.12]  That's
[1738.12 --> 1738.30]  Something
[1738.30 --> 1738.48]  That
[1738.48 --> 1738.58]  We
[1738.58 --> 1738.84]  Said
[1738.84 --> 1739.24]  Before
[1739.24 --> 1739.92]  In
[1739.92 --> 1740.12]  This
[1740.12 --> 1740.40]  Case
[1740.40 --> 1740.68]  It's
[1740.68 --> 1740.78]  A
[1740.78 --> 1741.04]  Product
[1741.04 --> 1750.70]  Dep
[1750.70 --> 1751.32]  Behind
[1751.32 --> 1751.34]  Sand
[1751.34 --> 1754.32]  Sure
[1754.32 --> 1759.84]  and that makes it a great deal if you were a potential 3090 buyer but and this is another
[1759.84 --> 1764.58]  Riley note the question is who was asking for this yeah that's a great question and I can see
[1764.58 --> 1771.56]  why people are mad but I'm also standing behind what we said for that particular buyer the fact
[1771.56 --> 1776.02]  that there's going to be more of them than there were 3090s which will help you get your hands on
[1776.02 --> 1782.34]  that level of performance at hopefully a lower price at MSRP instead of from a scalper is a good
[1782.34 --> 1789.60]  deal so to be clear I'm not saying hardware Canucks was wrong I'm not saying that gamers nexus was
[1789.60 --> 1795.32]  wrong actually gamers nexus was wrong about one thing the idea that scalper prices are just derived
[1795.32 --> 1802.40]  from MSRP and yeah it just doesn't work that way but I'm not saying gamers nexus or hardware unboxed
[1802.40 --> 1809.84]  was wrong about it you know being a money grab or not being a good deal and I don't think I don't
[1809.84 --> 1813.92]  think to to put words in his mouth which I could even be wrong about um I don't think he's saying
[1813.92 --> 1818.50]  you should be happy about it necessarily either me it's just it's just yeah it's not at all for you
[1818.50 --> 1824.18]  it's not for you yeah and for the people that it's for it's fine there's been a really weird
[1824.18 --> 1829.88]  normalization like I feel like when I was first building computers uh the cards that people really
[1829.88 --> 1835.84]  excited about from the Nvidia side their numbers are easy to follow were like the 60s and 70s yep
[1835.84 --> 1846.66]  yeah 6600 GT that was a good card that was a sweet card I I like I don't know it's it's timing wasn't
[1846.66 --> 1851.22]  exactly the greatest but I remember being super excited about my 2060 and I wrote that thing out
[1851.22 --> 1858.64]  for like four years yeah um and I I there's I think you mean 260 did I say 2060 I meant 260 yeah
[1858.64 --> 1863.88]  sorry 60 wasn't a great bang for the buck no and I never had one I had a 260 and I wrote that out for
[1863.88 --> 1869.04]  a long time and it was great and I remember a new battlefield came out I don't remember which one
[1869.04 --> 1873.88]  it was I'm sorry but a new battlefield came out and it was like starting to get to the point where I was
[1873.88 --> 1879.74]  like all right this is a little rough and then I finally upgraded um I think there there's this culture
[1879.74 --> 1886.32]  going around right now um where you have to run everything at ultra and you have to get 120 fps
[1886.32 --> 1893.06]  um which like those things are great don't get me wrong fantastic love the experience um but when
[1893.06 --> 1899.78]  you can't do it like you don't need to break your bank for it it's okay you'll be all right you'll
[1899.78 --> 1904.86]  live you're probably just playing like League of Legends anyways just to be completely honest
[1904.86 --> 1909.40]  uh like I don't know you you almost certainly don't need this and if you do
[1909.40 --> 1919.72]  yeah sucks that you're buying during a scalping pandemic silicon shortage mixture of horribleness
[1919.72 --> 1926.58]  Jonathan in the YouTube chat says this passive aggressiveness and grandstanding is so damn
[1926.58 --> 1933.52]  annoying sometimes everything you are accusing others of you did or are doing now I I don't see
[1933.52 --> 1940.44]  the thing is I don't know how to respond to that like I don't I don't shape the reality right and I'm
[1940.44 --> 1945.70]  not being passive aggressive I'm being extremely forthright with y'all I'm telling you look this is
[1945.70 --> 1951.76]  what it is there's a shortage these are business decisions this is why they made them for that
[1951.76 --> 1959.06]  particular buyer at the high end of the market which still has not had its demand satisfied it's
[1959.06 --> 1966.38]  a good deal for a value buyer yeah it's a bad deal but you weren't the customer it's not a value card
[1966.38 --> 1972.66]  it's not a value card and I mean honestly something that's been really frustrating for me
[1972.66 --> 1979.42]  as part of verified actual gamer program is every single participant okay every single one of them
[1979.42 --> 1986.24]  I have asked hey can we do something more mainstream can we do a 1650 or a 1660 can we do something that's
[1986.24 --> 1991.36]  actually affordable and every single one of them has come back and said I can't get you any allocation
[1991.36 --> 1999.42]  of that and you can absolutely be furious about it 100 percent it just has nothing to do with the 38
[1999.42 --> 2008.92]  ETI yeah all right I think it's probably time for us to move on then that was that was the chungus
[2008.92 --> 2014.44]  topic do we uh do we do sponsors now or do we move on um no let's let's move on to let's move on to
[2014.44 --> 2021.44]  something else um oh my oh man this is hilarious uh do you remember that uh that luke was wrong
[2021.44 --> 2030.24]  like sort of meme thing yeah yeah do we need to do a linus was wrong shirt like if people are gonna call
[2030.24 --> 2035.62]  me if people are gonna call me like it's amazing the accusations that I get anytime someone doesn't
[2035.62 --> 2042.58]  agree with me it's like linus is on the take from nvidia I am hardly being paid off by by this group
[2042.58 --> 2048.76]  or this group I am hardly on speaking terms with anyone who wears a green name tag right now yeah
[2048.76 --> 2054.02]  and I'm I'm partially not partially I'm a little surprised people forget that that wasn't even that
[2054.02 --> 2060.94]  long ago like this is recent news the like war between ltt and nvidia this and I can tell you
[2060.94 --> 2068.88]  something right now linus is not about to necessarily work to fix that um like he's gonna stand by his words
[2068.88 --> 2076.02]  and like just but he's also not going to say that something that they do is like horrible when it's not
[2076.02 --> 2080.94]  uh swapode says come on it's like you guys aren't even listening I'm sorry I don't know how to deal
[2080.94 --> 2086.50]  with this nvidia hasn't sold an enthusiast card at msrp for well over four years don't just blame the
[2086.50 --> 2092.76]  pandemic nvidia is not a manufacturer that was like that was like at least a quarter of this whole
[2092.76 --> 2099.98]  conversation that's a really really important point nvidia is not a manufacturer the msrps are
[2099.98 --> 2106.10]  ultimately set by the manufacturers of the cards and they are based on external factors like what
[2106.10 --> 2118.26]  their costs are whether there are tariffs it is what it is like I is it expensive yeah yeah
[2118.26 --> 2125.06]  yeah but top end gpus have always been expensive they've always been expensive what was the price
[2125.06 --> 2134.88]  of the stupid uh gtx 690 oh I forget oh I remember that being astronomical I don't remember right now
[2134.88 --> 2139.38]  and to be clear it might not sound that high before he says it it might not even sound that high but
[2139.38 --> 2145.62]  things constantly scale yeah so it was a grand it was a grand back in the day and the stupidest thing
[2145.62 --> 2153.08]  about it was that it performed worse than two 680s and because it was clocked lower because it was a
[2153.08 --> 2160.46]  like dual card it just it just made no it made no sense but you gotta understand whether something
[2160.46 --> 2167.52]  makes sense is always within the context of the time that it was released the 690 made no sense
[2167.52 --> 2174.08]  because you could get two 680s so at the cost of just having a couple more pci express slots taken up
[2174.08 --> 2182.62]  you could get better performance by just getting two 680s but the reason that the 3080 ti does make
[2182.62 --> 2189.06]  sense is that in the context of this time if you can get it at msrp it's probably the best deal you're
[2189.06 --> 2196.26]  gonna get and I'm sorry and that sucks and we really are actually doing something about it we're trying
[2196.26 --> 2203.38]  verified actual gamer program has put cards in gamers hands at msrp we did everything we possibly could
[2203.38 --> 2211.70]  we started a computer hardware store like what do you what else can I possibly do I can whine about
[2211.70 --> 2217.86]  it I can walk out of a press conference do you think nvidia cares if I walk out of their press
[2217.86 --> 2223.34]  conference they literally don't eat like I sent an email saying hey thanks it was really refreshing
[2223.34 --> 2228.84]  that you guys were super straightforward in your manner of communication over various aspects of
[2228.84 --> 2235.34]  this launch because nvidia we have a long history of them basically playing cloak and dagger games
[2235.34 --> 2240.36]  is what I tell them I say look it's enough with the cloak and dagger just stop and just communicate
[2240.36 --> 2246.32]  clearly I've said it on many occasions and so I was I was really pleased that they were just
[2246.32 --> 2253.32]  forthright in their communication for a change and I didn't even get a response straight up didn't
[2253.32 --> 2258.52]  even get a reply don't imagine for a second that I'm somehow on nvidia's payroll here or that I'm
[2258.52 --> 2263.68]  somehow cozy with nvidia that's actually not the way it works anthony attended the briefing
[2263.68 --> 2270.86]  I don't know I just don't know what else I just don't know what else to say to people sometimes I
[2270.86 --> 2277.84]  go have your go have your conspiracy theory right like there's nothing that I can say to make you
[2277.84 --> 2284.18]  believe me yeah and that that's ultimately it they're not it's yeah the the the horde as a as a
[2284.18 --> 2289.60]  whole is not going to care or listen uh they're just mad and they're mad that the thing is expensive
[2289.60 --> 2298.10]  rar uh thing too much don't want to pay yeah that's fine um but it's it's not for you dude like you don't
[2298.10 --> 2303.86]  have to build blinged out systems build blinged out systems on pc part picker it's really fun I used to
[2303.86 --> 2309.80]  do it all the time yeah spend way too much money on pc part picker but don't check out zy says
[2309.80 --> 2315.66]  linus's argument is deceitful because he's ignoring the performance of the 3080 non-ti uh your argument
[2315.66 --> 2320.58]  is deceitful because you are ignoring the real world pricing of the 3080 non-ti
[2320.58 --> 2331.46]  the 3080 non-ti is not available for 6.99 us dollars go buy one then good luck and to be and to be
[2331.46 --> 2335.96]  clear he doesn't even just mean because of scalpers like it's not available for that anywhere you can't
[2335.96 --> 2343.20]  buy that from a store either so it is what it is like I understand this is having a huge impact
[2343.20 --> 2350.46]  on people's enthusiasm for computer hardware like we see it like we see it in the sentiment in our
[2350.46 --> 2357.78]  community but this is beyond our control the good news is there's some cool stuff uh why don't we change
[2357.78 --> 2366.00]  gears and talk about amd because amd has really done a lot to make gaming and life better for gamers
[2366.00 --> 2372.20]  over the last few years i don't know yeah uh let's start with fidelity effects super resolution finally
[2372.20 --> 2377.22]  it's coming amd has an upscaling feature that's positioned to challenge nvidia's deep learning
[2377.22 --> 2382.60]  super sampling offering up to two times the performance in games at 4k with ray tracing turned
[2382.60 --> 2390.14]  on their keynote showed godfall uh with a 59 increase in performance at 4k at ultra quality
[2390.14 --> 2398.94]  however it's important to note that super resolution is not just a copy of dlss which isn't necessarily a
[2398.94 --> 2406.08]  good thing so it actually supports hardware from both amd and nvidia which is cool so it launched the
[2406.08 --> 2415.52]  features supported on rx 6000 rx 5000 rx 500 and gtx 10 series and newer nvidia gpus and ryzen processors
[2415.52 --> 2421.38]  with radeon graphics on board are actually supported too but it uses a different upscaling technique that
[2421.38 --> 2430.18]  doesn't use an ai model like nvidia's so developers are responsible for implementing the fsr code in their
[2430.18 --> 2435.92]  games and they have full ownership over the final product which means that how good or not good it looks
[2435.92 --> 2442.24]  could come down to the game developers implementation or if it's actually going to be implemented but
[2442.24 --> 2447.12]  what it also means is that amd doesn't need to partner with game developers to get fsr in games
[2448.24 --> 2455.44]  like dlss it has multiple quality modes so you can set it to ultra quality balanced or performance and
[2455.44 --> 2460.72]  ultra quality can boost frame rates 50 or more while retaining as much detail as possible and then as you
[2460.72 --> 2464.80]  go down each performance mode gives you a higher frame rate at the cost of image quality
[2465.36 --> 2470.56]  in may amd published a patent for gaming super resolution that revealed a hybrid super sampling
[2470.56 --> 2476.24]  approach that will combine linear and non-linear upscaling technology so the original low res image
[2476.24 --> 2481.60]  passes through a linear upscaling network and then a non-linear upscaling network at the same time
[2481.60 --> 2486.96]  extracting different bits of information through each path and then fsr then combines these images to
[2486.96 --> 2491.20]  create a pixel grid that expands on each pixel for a high res image so then after some cleanup you're
[2491.20 --> 2495.60]  going to get your reconstructed image the patent also confirms that super resolution will work on
[2495.60 --> 2502.08]  multiple devices say for example a computer okay we knew that one or a gaming device or handheld device
[2502.08 --> 2508.80]  or set top box or tv so that's pretty neat right now amd supports over 100 gpus and cpus and has a release
[2508.80 --> 2513.68]  date of june 22nd like the rest of the fidelity effects suite you can access the setting in-game for
[2513.68 --> 2519.36]  supported titles as long as you have a supported graphics card it's available on pc only for the time
[2519.36 --> 2525.04]  being but i would be shocked if it doesn't show up on rdna2 based consoles like the xbox series x and
[2525.04 --> 2529.28]  playstation 5. there are over 10 game developers planning to use it in their games and engines in
[2529.28 --> 2540.96]  2021 and all of that's really cool but based on even like low res slides from amd's presentation about it
[2541.76 --> 2543.12]  it really doesn't look very good
[2543.12 --> 2551.44]  and anything that relies on developers is always highly questionable because there's it's been
[2551.44 --> 2556.32]  extremely documented for many many years the ever-changing landscape and hyper competitive
[2556.32 --> 2562.72]  competitiveness of game development leads to things being dropped off and scopes being reduced or massive
[2562.72 --> 2568.48]  massive crunch times and they don't necessarily want to add that on um so stuff like this where they're
[2568.48 --> 2576.96]  like yeah it's in the developers hands often just gets dropped so yeah we'll see how it goes um it just
[2576.96 --> 2584.48]  didn't it just didn't look that sharp i mean a big part of why dlss works so well is that nvidia works
[2584.48 --> 2591.20]  with the game developer to get samples of what the assets are supposed to look like at high resolution
[2591.20 --> 2600.00]  and then uses that to inform how it upscales the lower resolution native rendering that the gpu is
[2600.00 --> 2609.12]  actually doing so without that machine learning element i i mean realistically it was it was never
[2609.12 --> 2615.92]  going to match the results of deep learning super sampling but a lot of people are never going to look
[2615.92 --> 2620.08]  that closely at it and as long as they get more fps then i guess they're going to be happy it's just
[2620.08 --> 2628.56]  um definitely going to bear further investigation i'm sure the likes of hardware unboxed are going to
[2628.56 --> 2635.44]  do multiple videos really digging in pixel by pixel into how it goes i mean this is definitely something
[2635.44 --> 2641.20]  we're going to want to look into ourselves as well because when yeah whether it's a digital foundry is
[2641.20 --> 2645.76]  probably going to look into this a lot whether it's amd or nvidia whenever they come out with a feature
[2645.76 --> 2653.44]  that's like hey like those guys have but we've got it now too you gotta kind of go okay but do you
[2655.36 --> 2661.20]  do you really though is it really and it's such a funny thing that we're going back to
[2662.40 --> 2670.96]  rendering hacks i mean do you remember back in the days of like oh man you go you got to go way back to
[2670.96 --> 2679.76]  like nvidia's fx series right like when they were they were just way way behind the performance and
[2679.76 --> 2687.68]  importantly the image quality of amd's radeon 9000 series um there were all kinds of little driver
[2687.68 --> 2694.48]  tricks that the hardware press at the time were finding out that nvidia or ati as they were known
[2694.48 --> 2699.68]  back then were implementing uh you know whether it was shortcuts that they were taking when they
[2699.68 --> 2706.80]  detected certain applications like benchmarks or whether it was uh you know cheaper lower quality
[2707.92 --> 2713.52]  rendering approaches that they were sort of quietly implementing in the driver without telling anybody
[2714.16 --> 2720.80]  these days are not these days i should say then for a long time after getting called on it so many
[2720.80 --> 2727.60]  times and committing not to do it nvidia and ati amd both cleaned up their act for a very long time
[2727.60 --> 2734.56]  and then the funny thing is we're now kind of going back to those days where not only do we accept
[2735.12 --> 2743.12]  that both amd and nvidia are using their own sort of divergent paths to to kind to hackily make their
[2743.12 --> 2754.00]  performance better we're embracing it i mean it's from from like a from a purist standpoint where you know to me
[2754.00 --> 2761.04]  if you're gaming at 4k uh if you're not actually rendering natively at 4k are you really gaming at 4k
[2761.76 --> 2769.92]  um i i i find it kind of amusing that even people like me are coming around to it because the reality of it is
[2769.92 --> 2778.32]  in a fast-paced scene most people are not going to notice the difference between dlss and native
[2778.32 --> 2784.56]  resolution rendering they're just not going to i don't know that the same will be true of fidelity
[2784.56 --> 2789.60]  effects super resolution however just based on what i've seen so far which is not much
[2790.56 --> 2796.40]  it looks like it might end up just looking like vaseline smeared over the screen but and and it might
[2796.40 --> 2800.40]  get better over time but that's that's not something to buy a product based off of
[2802.72 --> 2807.28]  uh matthew way gets it there's nothing robbery about buying a luxury product
[2808.00 --> 2814.56]  yeah it's not a good value but nobody's forcing you to buy it and and i i think i think the price
[2814.56 --> 2818.72]  is silly and we've laughed at luxury products on the show before and that's not something that will
[2818.72 --> 2824.88]  necessarily change but uh yeah they're really expensive that's part of the yeah it's part of it i mean as
[2824.88 --> 2830.64]  as part of our oh man i don't want to get back on this topic but as part of our script review for
[2830.64 --> 2840.40]  that video anthony and i went on ebay and we took a variety of gpus 2080 ti's 2080s 3080s 3070s and we
[2840.40 --> 2847.60]  went through and we went okay what is the actual real world street price for these things i i think and
[2847.60 --> 2853.76]  compared to those it's a great deal something that hit me more to be honest and and i knew this already but
[2853.76 --> 2859.68]  i still uh is is not even the the scalped ebay prices but the what they're actually being sold
[2859.68 --> 2869.28]  at at stores versus nvidia's stated price like that difference is quite huge yeah uh in other good news
[2869.28 --> 2878.00]  back to amd uh new apus so this is really exciting we did a video about amd's ryzen 5000 excuse me
[2878.00 --> 2885.76]  4000 series apus quite recently and i was really frustrated to find out that well not to find out
[2885.76 --> 2894.08]  i was really frustrated that amd had this product with good onboard graphics uh zen 2 cores and it was
[2894.08 --> 2902.16]  a an oem only part now usually you think back luke like to all the oem only parts that we've seen over
[2902.16 --> 2910.00]  the years uh remember nvidia's geforce 800 series yeah me neither yeah 300 series what's oh am i
[2910.00 --> 2917.12]  thinking of 300 oh i'm sorry whatever i think it was both was it both i think so right 8 000 series
[2917.12 --> 2922.64]  maybe it was 8 000 sorry 8 000 series did i say thousand doesn't matter the point is uh you know
[2922.64 --> 2929.60]  remember these product generations that have been effectively skipped except that they actually did exist
[2929.60 --> 2935.60]  but only as oem only parts that were basically just rebranded the previous generation thing
[2935.60 --> 2940.24]  absolutely nothing changed just to make it seem like it was newer and better um
[2942.80 --> 2950.40]  yeah right okay right so those are the kind of thing that i am used to seeing as an oem only part
[2951.28 --> 2958.40]  but then amd comes out and they've got what in my mind was one of the best cpus in their lineup
[2958.40 --> 2965.12]  for value gamers at a time when gamers need value products something that they can game on today
[2965.12 --> 2970.16]  while they wait out this storm and they went and they made the things oem only they had them but you
[2970.16 --> 2978.24]  could only get them in a pre-built system from a tier one well amd answered my my prayers here and the
[2978.24 --> 2988.24]  5600g and 5700g are extremely exciting products uh the 5600g is six cores 12 threads zen 3 vega 7 graphics
[2988.24 --> 2997.68]  it's got the same 65 watt tdp as the 5600 non-g which doesn't exist anymore so the 5600x and except it
[2997.68 --> 3007.20]  has onboard graphics and there's just there's just no downside to me these look like a fantastic way to
[3007.20 --> 3013.04]  go because you get the benefit of onboard graphics and you basically don't have to pay for it your
[3013.04 --> 3018.32]  motherboard probably has outputs on it already um darling off you go on live out you go
[3024.96 --> 3031.12]  sorry about that um what was i talking about right so you get a gpu you get something you can actually
[3031.12 --> 3036.48]  use and you don't have to pay for it and one of the things that i actually found over the years that i
[3036.48 --> 3041.52]  didn't consider back when intel first started putting onboard graphics directly on their cpus with clarkdale
[3041.52 --> 3048.88]  is that it's really good for resale value because think about it just because you're going to have
[3048.88 --> 3055.28]  a dedicated graphics card anyway and you don't need the onboard graphics doesn't mean that whoever
[3055.28 --> 3062.40]  you turn around and flip that chip to especially now that amd is innovating so quickly with their cpus
[3062.40 --> 3067.76]  that you actually could feel like you need to upgrade every generation or two um whoever it is that
[3067.76 --> 3073.84]  you're going to turn around and flip that cpu to well they might not sorry you don't you don't what
[3074.40 --> 3078.88]  i lost you said you might feel like you need to upgrade every generation oh yeah you don't i'm just
[3078.88 --> 3085.04]  i'm just this yeah you know my opinion on people buying stuff way above what they need
[3085.04 --> 3090.24]  yes but i just feel like it's it's getting it's getting worse i don't know i don't know why maybe it
[3090.24 --> 3098.16]  isn't i could be entirely wrong but like the the anger over the the 3080 ti pricing um and and just
[3098.16 --> 3105.44]  like processors like old processors are still doing so well yeah you can still game on a 7700k just fine
[3106.00 --> 3111.04]  i recently did a test i'm i'm potentially doing a home theater piece this is totally off the side
[3111.04 --> 3116.64]  this is quite the tangent okay carry on luke sorry sorry i do want to go there for a second though um
[3116.64 --> 3120.32]  so i took apart my girlfriend's computer and we rebuilt it with some of my old hardware right
[3120.96 --> 3125.84]  yep so the stuff that was previously in geodude is is essentially my girlfriend's new computer in a
[3125.84 --> 3134.72]  new case um i took the board that she had which was this uh itx board with a 2600k on it um guess
[3134.72 --> 3142.08]  what that does when you pair it with a good gpu pretty good totally fine even though it's a 2600k
[3142.08 --> 3150.00]  it runs vr games at like decently acceptable rates ridiculous i it's it's amazing that is a cpu that is
[3150.00 --> 3158.72]  10 years old it is 10 years old years old and sure you might be susceptible to meltdown inspector
[3159.92 --> 3167.84]  but i i think the gfs uh gaming rig probably kind of a non-concern yeah probably a non-issue it's
[3167.84 --> 3172.72]  fantastic like you don't you don't necessarily need this stuff you can you can relax it's okay
[3172.72 --> 3178.96]  sorry continue back to another reason that a cpu with good integrated graphics is awesome for resale
[3178.96 --> 3183.36]  is that just because you were just going to use it with a dedicated graphics card doesn't mean that
[3183.36 --> 3188.24]  whoever you sell it to was going to want to do that so having the one that has onboard graphics i've
[3188.24 --> 3193.84]  found has actually made a significant difference to how much demand there is for it once the time comes
[3193.84 --> 3199.76]  to flip it just something that something that i noticed over the years uh participating in the
[3199.76 --> 3206.96]  secondary market um so the higher end one the 5700g this is a really cool product it's 8 core 16 threads
[3206.96 --> 3214.56]  4.6 gigahertz boost 65 watt tdp on that one as well vega 8 integrated graphics with 8 cus 5 blah blah blah
[3214.56 --> 3225.28]  359 that cpu and wow i'm going to i'm sure someone's going to dig up this clip years from now and find a
[3225.28 --> 3234.96]  way to make me super wrong about this but that cpu could be your 2600k that cpu could be the one you are
[3234.96 --> 3242.24]  still running in 10 years i see no reason why not there i don't know whether you're wrong or not i want
[3242.24 --> 3247.04]  someone to dig this up because i would love to see this down the line i would actually love to see
[3247.04 --> 3252.96]  like a video on this cpu in x amount of years because that kind of stuff is very very interesting
[3254.64 --> 3261.44]  and yeah that's awesome very well balanced really cool processor um yeah i that so that's cool and
[3261.44 --> 3268.48]  the fact that it's available at a price that is actually is actually attainable is great apparently
[3268.48 --> 3274.48]  gamers nexus in the chat uh gamers nexus no one needs to upgrade every generation only when your
[3274.48 --> 3279.20]  current card is starting to fall behind you know what that's a really interesting conversation you
[3279.20 --> 3284.72]  know talking about how outraged people are about 3080 ti when i'm looking at it going how many people
[3284.72 --> 3291.60]  are really buying top tier graphics cards anyway is part of it just that people are getting are getting
[3291.60 --> 3299.28]  like pulled up like pulled along in this fomo this like i feel like yeah just kind of there's a lot of
[3299.28 --> 3309.04]  losing track you know yeah like just like losing the plot here like i i went i went three years
[3309.04 --> 3315.20]  or something like that without without upgrading the gpu in my primary rig not because i can't afford it
[3315.92 --> 3321.36]  not because i can't just literally pluck one off a shelf at work and bring it home but because i didn't
[3321.36 --> 3327.76]  need it and there's nothing wrong with that yeah you don't have to have the fastest gpu apparently
[3327.76 --> 3334.88]  know that to say that's a fake steve all right well i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry i thought it was a real steve
[3335.68 --> 3340.56]  wait no fake steve that's not fake steve there's a verify as the verified check mark fake i don't think so
[3341.92 --> 3347.84]  there's a fake gamers nexus in here ignore that one so no real steve is actually here i just don't know
[3347.84 --> 3356.56]  which steve i'm talking to right now oh no oh no oh man now now now i'm in now i'm in trouble the
[3356.56 --> 3362.16]  only way to know if it's a real steve would just be to call him um i'm kind of done with this topic
[3362.16 --> 3371.04]  though is you guys doing a uh course for gamers course sorry what now do you remember those we we
[3371.04 --> 3376.56]  used to make i think it was like once a year we'd do course for gamers it was a video um yeah we should
[3376.56 --> 3382.08]  totally do it how many cores gaming yeah yeah we should revisit that maybe with the uh you know
[3382.08 --> 3387.60]  what we could do it around the uh the launch of the 5700g that would be awesome just kind of say okay
[3388.24 --> 3396.56]  how how you know how overkill is eight cores for gaming today and kind of exploring that because it
[3396.56 --> 3403.44]  will be very overkill for gaming today and is this the kind of thing i hate to use the f word but is this
[3403.44 --> 3410.48]  a cpu that could be future proof i would make the argument based on what i know today that it is a
[3410.48 --> 3417.04]  real solid bet to be a real great investment i think future proof becomes less of a swear word when
[3417.04 --> 3422.64]  you're doing it with value oriented devices if that makes sense or products oh when you're going like
[3422.64 --> 3429.28]  i'm i'm future proofing by buying this individual part that's twelve hundred dollars or eighteen hundred
[3429.28 --> 3433.12]  dollars yeah that's that's ridiculous don't do that don't buy that because of future proofing but when
[3433.12 --> 3437.84]  you're buying something that's already evaluated i mean you're like a really cool additional thing
[3437.84 --> 3442.00]  that is beyond just all the reasons why i already want to buy this thing is that it might also be
[3442.00 --> 3446.88]  future proofing me in a few ways that's fantastic the best future proofing is bang for the buck and
[3446.88 --> 3452.80]  i'll tell you why because if you buy the top end one that is twice the price for 10 more performance
[3453.44 --> 3460.48]  yes you are going to get more of a lifespan out of that product in terms of it's it meeting a minimum
[3460.48 --> 3464.56]  bar of performance than if you had bought a cheaper one but there's a couple of problems
[3464.56 --> 3468.96]  with that logic number one is that you bought a top spec product so clearly you have very high
[3468.96 --> 3475.76]  expectations in terms of performance realistically there is no future proofing you're gonna resell it
[3475.76 --> 3481.04]  and you're gonna upgrade it so okay fine that's just a that's a very different that's a very different
[3481.04 --> 3485.36]  type of of customer and you just shouldn't even really be having the future proofing conversation
[3485.36 --> 3490.72]  you should just say i like to spend a lot because i'm a mad baller and i'm into that and just own it
[3491.44 --> 3499.60]  number two is that future proofing is not about what you buy today it's about optimization of your funds
[3500.16 --> 3505.04]  this is something that would always drive me crazy in the computer store if someone would come in
[3505.04 --> 3511.60]  and they'd want to spend way more on something that's way more expensive for a small amount less money
[3511.60 --> 3518.08]  because you know well i have the money for a pc today and i'm ready to buy it today and i don't
[3518.08 --> 3523.36]  wanna you know i just want whatever's the best today and i'm like no no no no no no no no no no no
[3523.36 --> 3531.28]  if you have four thousand dollars today you quite literally have two thousand dollars today and two
[3531.28 --> 3532.96]  thousand dollars two years from now
[3535.28 --> 3540.88]  and i would try to explain this to people and they would just they would fight me on it and i would end up
[3540.88 --> 3545.28]  just letting them spend the money the vast majority of the time but they just they couldn't wrap
[3545.28 --> 3551.44]  their brain around with how fast the computer industry moves and that was especially true back then
[3551.44 --> 3558.32]  you are so much better off spending two thousand dollars today keeping that two thousand dollars
[3558.32 --> 3564.40]  and if i don't care put it in a gic it doesn't matter keep that two thousand dollars have the discipline
[3564.40 --> 3572.08]  keep it and then in a couple years buy another one and you will have two computers you'll have one
[3572.08 --> 3577.28]  that is a good computer still because it was two thousand dollars and you will have another one that
[3577.28 --> 3582.64]  is faster than what you would have bought for four thousand dollars in the first place and you can just
[3582.64 --> 3586.80]  sell if you don't want two computers you can sell your old one and that makes the price of the new
[3586.80 --> 3594.48]  one ridiculously it used to drive me so crazy because the math is so simple but people just
[3594.48 --> 3600.40]  they didn't they didn't want to hear it you know oh lordy i've got a call from one stephen burke
[3601.20 --> 3609.60]  oh wait is this the real is this the real gamers nexus i was listening to your stream and uh oh i'm
[3609.60 --> 3614.56]  i'm back four minutes but you just read a quote from me that i didn't type from chat so that's a fake
[3614.56 --> 3620.16]  person yes yes we we got it that that was the wrong gamers nexus we got we got warned by the chat
[3621.76 --> 3627.76]  i wasn't gonna call you during your stream until i saw you reading fake gamers nexus quotes i thought
[3627.76 --> 3633.84]  i i better make sure this doesn't this doesn't go south oh that's weird hold on a second it's still
[3633.84 --> 3638.32]  on the earpiece even though i've got it set to speaker yeah i don't i don't know if the stream can
[3638.32 --> 3644.32]  hear it or not but at least the mic that i hear you what are you saying i was just saying that i
[3644.32 --> 3649.12]  wanted to uh call and interrupt you to make sure you aren't going to read more
[3649.76 --> 3655.28]  quotes from a fake gm account because i didn't want to get in trouble for what uh a counterfeit
[3655.28 --> 3660.48]  was saying yeah no no no don't worry steve you're not in trouble you could never say anything that
[3660.48 --> 3667.12]  would upset me don't don't worry about it we so the thing is i mean okay for the viewers out there you
[3667.12 --> 3672.88]  guys got to understand steve and i have disagreed about a great many things we we are not we're not
[3672.88 --> 3680.32]  always on the same page and that's okay that's the beauty of an independent press right right
[3680.64 --> 3687.28]  that's it's part of the reason why we yeah i mean we've got a different actually i want you know am
[3687.28 --> 3692.16]  i on speaker can people hear me absolutely they're they're saying in the chat they can hear you one
[3692.16 --> 3697.84]  thing there's so there's a few things you said on this podcast i don't necessarily agree with but i
[3697.84 --> 3703.44]  actually don't care too much about that one thing i did want to point out though is i saw a good amount
[3703.44 --> 3709.28]  of comments on your review that were like i think there's money involved and linus got paid for his
[3709.28 --> 3715.36]  opinion i just i would like to point out that i know how busy i am and i don't have like 50 employees
[3715.36 --> 3725.36]  i i really don't think linus you know uh is concerned about what opinion to have from nvidia
[3725.36 --> 3731.04]  of all people so i just i just i thought that was it's it's more likely that there's a
[3731.76 --> 3736.80]  a lot of links in your chain first of all so you have to actually get to a review you publish that
[3736.80 --> 3742.88]  video about how you guys make videos and to actually get to a review requires a lot more people
[3742.88 --> 3750.72]  in the lmg chain than it does for us so the the opinion will be flavored by more people you know
[3750.72 --> 3757.60]  at your company than at ours so that's that's part of the difference but yeah yeah absolutely i just
[3757.60 --> 3763.36]  want to point that out it's sort of like uh is it occam's razor is that the easiest solution is the most
[3763.36 --> 3772.24]  likely one uh yes pretty much well the thing is yeah a lot of people think that you know nvidia or amd
[3772.24 --> 3780.56]  or intel or whatever um are basically bribing the tech media but the problem is that the the surest
[3780.56 --> 3789.04]  way to out yourself as a fanboy is to accuse someone else of being a paid shill um right because
[3789.04 --> 3794.24]  it basically just demonstrates that you're you don't want to or you're not capable of making an
[3794.24 --> 3803.04]  objective argument and you would rather just throw sticks and stones um yeah i mean i i like i just
[3803.04 --> 3809.60]  thought there were legitimate reasons to disagree over opinions on the product but sure i just i was
[3809.60 --> 3815.12]  kind of disheartened to see how many were like there's money involved and it's like i mean linus
[3815.12 --> 3821.68]  could say something about ltdstore.com and make more money than whatever nvidia would be willing to pay for
[3821.68 --> 3828.08]  that opinion anyway you're like you and i both know that's true they are it's just it's just they
[3828.08 --> 3838.72]  are so cheap silly oh man good old good old nvidia yep all right well thanks thanks for calling in steve
[3840.16 --> 3843.68]  yeah yeah have a good uh show all right have a good weekend
[3843.68 --> 3854.24]  oh that's great so yeah um i unfortunately couldn't hear a single word that he said oh sorry luke
[3854.24 --> 3859.68]  yeah he basically said that um we should just go back to having you do all the gpu reviews because
[3859.68 --> 3865.20]  clearly anthony and i can't handle it i'm kidding no he didn't know he's the best than he dude no no he
[3865.20 --> 3873.76]  didn't he didn't he didn't say that at all all right uh let's uh oh speaking of uh making more
[3873.76 --> 3878.56]  money than nvidia would be willing to pay me let's talk to uh hey who's our sponsors for the show today
[3879.28 --> 3884.24]  ridge wallet wants you to stop carrying around pointless items like receipts old hotel room keys
[3884.24 --> 3890.48]  and spent gift cards with a ridge wallet you will carry less because you can't carry that much in it
[3890.48 --> 3895.20]  that is by design it uses two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band to keep your
[3895.20 --> 3901.44]  cards tightly in place but still accessible it's rfid blocking has a lifetime guarantee and is available
[3901.44 --> 3907.28]  in aluminum carbon fiber and titanium and they don't just sell wallets they got battery banks
[3907.28 --> 3912.72]  bags smartphone covers and more and you can use offer code whoops mike i'm on why am i on tux care
[3913.52 --> 3919.84]  ah there we go and you can use offer code when to save 10 on everything at ridge.com
[3919.84 --> 3924.96]  slash when so we're going to have that linked in the video description the show is also brought to
[3924.96 --> 3931.04]  you by tux care and i'm just going to leave ridge wallet's banner up i guess is that is that how this
[3931.04 --> 3936.48]  works thanks to tux care for sponsoring today's video tux care helps enterprise companies take care
[3936.48 --> 3942.08]  of support maintenance and security of linux systems and the portfolio of tux care services includes live
[3942.08 --> 3948.00]  patching for linux kernels shared libraries virtualization databases and embedded devices
[3948.00 --> 3954.72]  um they also provide enterprises with end-of-life linux support and they try to provide official
[3954.72 --> 3961.04]  support for the new centos replacement ulma linux os oh man we're gonna have to deal with that at some
[3961.04 --> 3968.16]  point in the near future here our um our vault is running centos like six or something
[3968.16 --> 3975.12]  thankfully a little bit a little bit yikes there's tux care uh tux care services are installed on more
[3975.12 --> 3979.84]  than half a million enterprise linux systems and you can check them out and apply for a free proof of
[3979.84 --> 3985.76]  concept at the link below on tux care's website that's tuxcare.com the show is also brought to you
[3985.76 --> 3990.96]  by csonic thanks to csonic for sponsoring today's video their prime ultra titanium pc power supplies
[3990.96 --> 3997.04]  feature ultra high efficiency with their 80 plus titanium rating they are fully modular they feature hybrid fan
[3997.04 --> 4003.20]  control so they are silent when they are not being used heavily and when they do spin up their fans
[4003.20 --> 4008.32]  they've got fluid dynamic fan bearings that mean they're still pretty darn quiet they offer up to a
[4008.32 --> 4014.32]  50 000 hour life expectancy along with a 12 year warranty and you can check them out at the link below on
[4014.32 --> 4024.08]  csonic's website or on amazon which is also linked down below all right sorry i gotta i keep having to
[4024.08 --> 4030.80]  shift the stupid things around so server upgrade sponsored video from tux care i know right when's
[4030.80 --> 4036.00]  it happening i don't know pulse get it going pulse way always tries to get in on our server videos so i
[4036.00 --> 4041.28]  i don't know if tux care is even going to get a crack at it they can try though they can try what if you
[4041.28 --> 4050.32]  just do them both at the same time oh double dip and nvidia i'll get nvidia to pay for it yeah that'll be
[4050.32 --> 4058.32]  good all right let's talk about oh we've got a new shirt on lttstore.com speaking of uh things that
[4058.32 --> 4064.96]  make a lot more money than nvidia check this out i actually really like this one sarah did a fantastic
[4064.96 --> 4071.76]  job of the design yeah it's the do not drop shirt uh so she took some of the designs that she created
[4071.76 --> 4077.68]  for our sticker packs actually i think most of them are from the first sticker pack and uh made like
[4077.68 --> 4083.36]  apparently this is this is cool now or something having like graphics on the on the back of the
[4083.36 --> 4089.92]  shirt like that so that's pretty neat hey look at that got some new shirt models got madison and mark
[4089.92 --> 4094.80]  and more madison and more me i don't even know i don't even know what i'm doing here but i got my
[4094.80 --> 4102.40]  hands in my pockets got more madison got that appears to be who is that is that james who wears that
[4102.40 --> 4110.80]  watch i actually don't know hey you got a prime anyway so if you're into that kind of style this
[4110.80 --> 4116.32]  is going to be one of the last black shirts we launch we finally seem to have locked in a shirt
[4116.32 --> 4126.00]  supplier that meets both our uh supply and uh not both our supply quality and uh factory conditions uh
[4126.00 --> 4132.08]  requirements so i'm really really excited but it'll be like with the way shipping is worldwide right now
[4132.48 --> 4138.56]  either we'll be paying like thousands and thousands of dollars extra for air shipping or it'll be a
[4138.56 --> 4144.56]  very very long time uh mousepad restock is now delayed at least two weeks because there were
[4144.56 --> 4151.60]  coveted exposures at the port that we shipped from that factory with um so the the container has just
[4151.60 --> 4159.36]  been sitting there for like two weeks um yeah man worldwide logistics is a show right now it's bad
[4159.36 --> 4167.68]  it's bad it's bad oh actually there's one other bit of news for ltt store that's only like not
[4167.68 --> 4174.08]  really product related at all um this has been a big project for well actually this particular thing i
[4174.08 --> 4178.32]  don't think has been a big project but this has been a project that the float plane team has worked on
[4178.32 --> 4184.56]  we now have reviews look at that so if you've bought something before you should be able to
[4184.56 --> 4190.72]  leave a verified review and we really do want your feedback guys so please feel free leave uh leave
[4190.72 --> 4197.92]  reviews let us know what you think hey good stuff finally got reviews it's exciting there's there's more
[4197.92 --> 4203.76]  cool stuff coming for the store some of its back end so you guys won't see it but um there's also there's
[4203.76 --> 4211.60]  also fun stuff for you too hey i like the back end me too okay our next topic is is intel really
[4211.60 --> 4220.56]  stretching the definition of what a nook is at this point the original source is tom's hardware here
[4221.28 --> 4228.08]  and do you remember when intel first announced the nook nook original announcement let's let's go
[4228.08 --> 4232.96]  let's go find that what what is that wow i don't even know if we're going to be able to find anything
[4232.96 --> 4240.00]  that old did it look like an evil toaster back then i don't think so okay next unit of computing
[4240.00 --> 4246.00]  nobody uses that terminology anymore so maybe that'll bring up older articles that's a good call
[4246.00 --> 4253.76]  2012 here it is review intel's next unit of computing from the tech report that's a nook okay and the whole
[4253.76 --> 4261.20]  idea the reason they called it the next unit of computing was that it was supposed to be super small
[4262.08 --> 4268.32]  but still have desktop like performance rather than being limited by the performance of hey look
[4268.32 --> 4274.80]  it's scott wasson's hand uh rather than being limited by the performance of then low power cpus like their
[4274.80 --> 4286.32]  atom lineup okay so that's a nook but is this really a nook that's a usb port for scale this is the what is
[4286.32 --> 4294.48]  this the beast canyon and it's like pretty much this okay hey hey speaking of uh speaking of my fellow
[4294.48 --> 4302.08]  former members of the tech press there's a ryan shroud holding a beast canyon nook so let's go back this is
[4302.08 --> 4309.52]  a scott wasson holding a nook okay and this is a ryan shroud holding a new nook
[4312.40 --> 4318.32]  i don't know i don't know if it's really a nook anymore but it definitely supports discrete graphics
[4318.32 --> 4325.12]  cards up to 12 inches long um it uses intel's compute element platform which takes we've actually
[4325.12 --> 4328.96]  reviewed a product that uses already i forget what exactly that one was called it kind of doesn't matter
[4328.96 --> 4333.20]  because i i don't can't imagine too many people bought them ah the nook nine extreme that was the
[4333.20 --> 4339.60]  one so uses intel's compute element platform which takes the cpu ram storage all that stuff and actually
[4339.60 --> 4344.24]  was storage on i don't think it was on it uh but cpu ram for sure and kind of you plunk it in it's got
[4344.24 --> 4349.28]  the cooler all built in as a single module and you could like it plugs into kind of like a pci express
[4349.28 --> 4356.48]  slot type thing it's equipped with h series intel chips instead of u series which is neat uh so the
[4356.48 --> 4363.84]  phantom canyon nook which was legitimately actually small but um had more limited performance um
[4365.52 --> 4370.88]  it's had more limited performance so it's h series so that's faster i guess does anyone
[4371.68 --> 4377.68]  volume is wild there's there's some stats here which is crazy that's an eight liter footprint but
[4377.68 --> 4385.20]  there's there's a small form factor pc case the is it is that loke or luke oh yeah the loki i think
[4385.20 --> 4394.72]  is how they pronounce the ghost s1 is 8.2 yeah practically the same yeah that's that's a problem
[4395.76 --> 4401.68]  what are we doing because the thing is you can okay okay you can make the argument that well yeah but
[4401.68 --> 4413.12]  the loki ghost is really expensive um that's true but so is the beast canyon so your your your defense of
[4413.12 --> 4417.76]  the beast canyon in that case would kind of fall apart a little bit now i don't know if there are
[4417.76 --> 4424.24]  too many system integrators that are actually building pre-built systems in the loki ghost and
[4424.24 --> 4430.00]  that's an advantage that the beast canyon will have is if you're uh if you're an si and you're looking to
[4430.00 --> 4437.12]  pump these things out it is it is not that easy building a diy computer in an eight liter chassis that
[4437.12 --> 4443.36]  that's not something that's just for you know even your average technician to do at scale and and not
[4443.36 --> 4449.52]  make mistakes right or not have to spend a lot of time like oh you know shoot now i get it now oh we've
[4449.52 --> 4455.20]  got a doa piece of hardware now i have to spend an hour and a half taking this thing apart another half
[4455.20 --> 4461.44]  an hour putting it back together so from like a business standpoint i can understand that offering
[4461.44 --> 4469.52]  it pre-built in a in a low-key ghost s1 is not necessarily the the best idea but for the diy
[4469.52 --> 4477.44]  community um yeah it's a it's a tough it's a tough argument but there is there are customers out there
[4477.44 --> 4483.12]  for it i remember having this conversation with whoever the writer was for our most recent nook
[4483.12 --> 4488.00]  review where they basically went okay yeah i wrote it in the context of i thought it was i thought the
[4488.00 --> 4493.12]  customer was like this person i'm like what do you mean you thought go find out who the customer is
[4493.84 --> 4499.28]  if you don't actually know who the customer is how can you possibly write the review tailored to the
[4499.28 --> 4504.16]  people who should actually care about it and they're like well how do i do that i'm like well you go and
[4504.16 --> 4509.84]  you look at the previous generation product and you read customer reviews you find out what the people
[4509.84 --> 4515.36]  who actually bought this thing liked about it disliked about it obviously you have to filter it
[4515.36 --> 4519.52]  because there's going to be a lot of fake reviews in there and then you address those concerns if
[4519.52 --> 4524.96]  people are saying hey uh you know this one's runs way too hot well then we need to investigate that we
[4524.96 --> 4530.00]  need to look at the new one does it run cooler if they say the performance was really good we need to
[4530.00 --> 4538.00]  investigate that too have they made compromises to the performance um and maybe sometimes we take that
[4538.00 --> 4545.44]  approach to a fault like with the 3080 ti review where we we reviewed it in the context of hey you're
[4545.44 --> 4554.64]  shopping for a thousand plus dollar graphics card sorry guys um but we've also gotten some super chats
[4554.64 --> 4560.88]  during the show that are like you guys are bang on i was shopping for a graphics card in that price
[4560.88 --> 4568.16]  point i bought it i'm thrilled like okay but then maybe we should i don't know like well sometimes i
[4568.16 --> 4573.04]  don't know what to do you guys you know should we tailor our reviews to the the largest audience
[4573.04 --> 4578.08]  possible should we tailor our reviews to the people who are legitimately looking to buy the thing
[4578.08 --> 4584.88]  should we tailor our reviews to just the tech interested the enthusiasts that are our kin you know i
[4584.88 --> 4589.52]  don't know because you end up writing a surprisingly different video from all those different
[4589.52 --> 4594.32]  perspectives and we can't do all of them i don't know now i'm just kind of now i'm just kind of
[4594.32 --> 4599.04]  chatting at you guys um we have we have a couple more headline topics uh luke do you want to talk us
[4599.04 --> 4605.44]  through huawei going their own way haha all the way going their own way yeah so quite a while ago we
[4605.44 --> 4612.48]  we talked on the wan show and so did tons of other places about the u.s kind of pushing out huawei and
[4612.48 --> 4618.16]  some other stuff two years ago two years after huawei was added to the u.s entity list that banned them
[4618.16 --> 4624.32]  from using us technologies they have so they can't use android os anymore they have officially
[4624.32 --> 4630.16]  released their alternative smartphone operating system harmony os 2.0 that's really fast
[4631.92 --> 4636.24]  just putting that out there that is super fast hopefully it's hopefully it's good but that is
[4636.24 --> 4642.32]  super fast the company wants to see the os be integrated into a stack of os's with versions
[4642.32 --> 4649.20]  extending to a car os smart things os so yeah they're just trying to replace the the operating
[4649.20 --> 4656.32]  system stack that you would see with other similar devices due to having um android auto and uh whatever
[4656.32 --> 4663.12]  the apple one is called in your car etc the huawei p40 and mate x2 among others will be the smartphones to
[4663.12 --> 4669.92]  get the os as an update and it will be shipped with the huawei watch and mate pad pro tablet and
[4669.92 --> 4675.04]  release throughout their lineup through to the end of the year the company denies that harmony os is
[4675.04 --> 4680.96]  a derivative of android and that no single line of code is identical to that of android interesting
[4682.00 --> 4687.28]  that's this is a big part of the reason why i'm like that was really fast because if it was like
[4687.28 --> 4693.20]  okay whatever but if it's not that's that's pretty crazy impressive uh ours technica has trouble seeing
[4693.20 --> 4699.36]  how different harmony os is from android this continues to be the weird journey journey their reporter had to
[4699.36 --> 4704.72]  take to get to access the sdk and emulator which uh involved among many other things sending him
[4705.68 --> 4711.04]  sending his us passport photo that's wow this is nuts hold on i'm bringing i'm bringing this up so
[4711.04 --> 4718.72]  a two-day background check um and here's harmony os yep that looks very different from android
[4718.72 --> 4734.56]  uh okay a device info app identifies harmony os as android 10 so that's interesting um yep this is
[4734.56 --> 4742.16]  getting really awkward really fast this is a wow this looks like a great article uh this is awesome i i'm
[4742.16 --> 4749.52]  gonna go read this as soon as the show is over anyway the point is um yeah so luke your first
[4749.52 --> 4756.00]  reaction to harmony os 2.0 as a thing was like wow that's really fast i think we might have gotten to
[4756.00 --> 4764.56]  the bottom of it yeah yeah that makes a little bit more sense okay okay it's it takes a lot to make these
[4764.56 --> 4770.48]  things like it takes a really significant amount of time and investment and two years to generate that is
[4770.48 --> 4776.40]  wild and my my immediate reaction was okay there's either tons of stolen stuff and then there's like
[4776.40 --> 4783.84]  there's no identical line so it's okay um the the other option is that it's horrible um it sounds like
[4783.84 --> 4788.16]  there might be tons of stolen stuff i think i think that's maybe the direction that we're not
[4788.16 --> 4794.88]  huawei we'll have to sorry no no no not huawei they wouldn't do that of course no definitely not no no no
[4794.88 --> 4806.24]  where's my check ccp yeah as if and in other news the leaked cd project red data has been made public
[4806.24 --> 4813.28]  question mark so like i said in the intro uh the source code for cyberpunk 2077 the source code for
[4813.28 --> 4819.12]  the red engine the source code for witcher 3 uh previous and next gen so i believe that's talking
[4819.12 --> 4826.24]  about consoles source code for throne breaker uh and the ps5 ps4 switch and xbox series x sdk so that
[4826.24 --> 4832.48]  is a lot of stuff and that is a lot of important stuff um as far as my understanding goes it is all
[4832.48 --> 4838.88]  password protected i don't know how intensely um i don't believe i've seen specifics on that so i don't
[4838.88 --> 4846.24]  know if it's uh gonna be like super well encrypted or anything um i suspect so but we'll see this data was
[4846.24 --> 4850.56]  uh an article that we're talking about way previously on wancho where uh the people that
[4850.56 --> 4857.44]  acquired it uh were trying to sell it for uh starting bit of a million dollars or about of seven or about
[4857.44 --> 4864.96]  seven million dollars yeah and they took it off the forum and sold it discreetly um we we assumed that
[4864.96 --> 4870.64]  that may have been them just not really being able to sell it but who knows um maybe they did get some
[4870.64 --> 4876.16]  offer that that satisfied them off platform it's definitely possible this is extremely valuable data
[4876.16 --> 4882.16]  um it's not that valuable if you have no way of um decrypting it though is a bit of an issue yeah
[4882.16 --> 4888.72]  yeah um but but we don't know uh the data was posted via a torrent the sdk archives are not password
[4888.72 --> 4893.44]  protected okay so just the source codes are uh oh they claim they have the passwords for the other
[4893.44 --> 4898.80]  archives so they say they're the ones who password protected them but they want a ten thousand dollar
[4898.80 --> 4905.44]  donation they're claiming these donations will go toward charity fundraising what even is this this is
[4906.16 --> 4916.16]  stupid don't send them 10 grand it's a good deal in the context of the price of stolen other cg project
[4916.80 --> 4917.04]  sorry
[4920.64 --> 4927.12]  it's a great deal it's a good deal there's no no one else no you can't buy this or if you were if you
[4927.12 --> 4933.36]  were in the market if you were in the market for ten thousand dollars worth of stolen data this is this is
[4933.36 --> 4939.04]  good stolen data this is fantastic data it's a great price don't be don't don't please don't
[4939.04 --> 4947.60]  take this seriously i sometimes i sometimes i just like that sometimes i say stuff like this and i will
[4947.60 --> 4956.40]  actually get unironic angry emails asking why i'm promoting you know sell a buying stolen goods
[4957.20 --> 4965.52]  i'm not please please no it's verbal irony please um so yeah verbal irony means you say one thing and
[4965.52 --> 4970.32]  you mean the opposite thing so i will give you the straightforward version now do not buy this it is a
[4970.32 --> 4976.64]  it is a bad idea and it's a bad idea for me to carry on the show because i think that's pretty
[4976.64 --> 4984.88]  much it oh wait super chats super chats why did we get so many super chats today why are you guys so
[4984.88 --> 4991.28]  into this uh tuner builder asks will the 3080 ti be coming to the verified actual gamer program
[4991.28 --> 4999.12]  we do have one partner that has managed to get us some 3080 ti allocation yes so um i don't know
[4999.12 --> 5003.84]  don't buy it or do buy it it doesn't matter it's up to you i don't care the performance graphs are
[5003.84 --> 5008.88]  what they are and the price is what it is you do the math there is that better is that what you guys want
[5008.88 --> 5013.20]  uh jason says first time watching the wan show live thanks linus you were the gateway into me
[5013.20 --> 5019.36]  being crazy excited about tech take my money hey thanks jason uh adam says do you think samsung will
[5019.36 --> 5024.08]  ever return to form with the note line and make a note worth taking over from the note 9 i don't
[5024.08 --> 5031.76]  think so i think that the days of headphone jacks and iris scanners and whatever are pretty much done
[5032.40 --> 5038.00]  now i can't tell if this message was sent to me because it's news for the wan show but i'm going to
[5038.00 --> 5045.20]  assume no i'm going to ask though sorry no the one from me no okay wait i didn't even get your
[5045.20 --> 5054.40]  message early on in the show no it's for after it's fine oh okay cool uh i think that this person
[5054.40 --> 5059.28]  who messaged me might not have realized that i am live right now so i'm not going to talk about that
[5059.28 --> 5065.04]  unless they confirm uh the slk66 says agreed but they shouldn't claim they're trying to help gamers at
[5065.04 --> 5070.64]  all just saying hey we want money deal with it yeah 100 but they also never claimed to be helping
[5070.64 --> 5078.56]  value gamers they're helping the very very top end most premium of their customers which is a
[5078.56 --> 5085.60]  legitimate path um you don't have to like it but i mean they they are gamers i saw a message in the
[5085.60 --> 5089.92]  chat earlier it was like linus needs to stop pretending that he needs to make videos for his
[5089.92 --> 5094.72]  audience instead of just people who have lots of money to spend it's like well believe it or not
[5094.72 --> 5100.96]  they're in there like and for the rest of us we can at least like enjoy the computer porn of all this
[5100.96 --> 5106.80]  high-end stuff right like it's there's a reason that we get a lot more views on a review of a high-end
[5106.80 --> 5112.40]  product than we do of a low-end product morphologists um the the guy that um
[5112.40 --> 5120.16]  um kind of collabed with uh tech wiki for the star season episode technically yes right like sorry so
[5120.16 --> 5129.68]  many channels um uh fair point he has an insane computer he's also like an architect that reviews
[5129.68 --> 5136.56]  the architecture of gigantic spaceships like it's it's really specialized and really cool um
[5136.56 --> 5143.28]  um but it's not every gamer you know jack philpot really great question hey linus i was wondering
[5143.28 --> 5148.40]  who was the writer for the wish pc video i was bored at work and i just re-watched it but their voice was
[5148.40 --> 5156.40]  altered because they were on probation it would be cool to know it was colin um thermu life so we were
[5156.40 --> 5161.68]  we going to have rolling wanshow intros or is this the intro for the next five years okay no no i'll get
[5161.68 --> 5167.76]  a new one i'll get a new one uh tim davis love the show definitely my ltc favorite content got my
[5167.76 --> 5173.52]  final exams from medical school next week you guys keep me saying hey good luck tim go for it the world
[5173.52 --> 5180.56]  kind of needs more doctors right now so rock it uh alex young hey linus and luke thanks for teaching
[5180.56 --> 5186.16]  uh board radar tech on night shift everything i need to know to build my ryzen 9 and 3090 snow blind rig
[5186.16 --> 5193.04]  hey thanks alex happy to help out uh howard says would you ship cards for verified actual gamer
[5193.04 --> 5198.88]  program to brazil i've avoided signing up because of this but cards beyond okay so the problem is that
[5198.88 --> 5204.96]  brazil has enormous import tariffs so we would have no problem shipping it there but you would be on the
[5204.96 --> 5209.52]  hook for tariffs so don't imagine that the price you see on our store is the price you'll end up paying
[5209.52 --> 5214.00]  if you don't like it there's nothing we can do about it the issue is with your government
[5214.00 --> 5221.84]  uh the kazakars kazragor says my biggest gripe with the 3080 ti is they're focusing on the top
[5221.84 --> 5225.84]  end rather than releasing more low-end products that could produce far more units per wafer that is
[5226.40 --> 5231.52]  totally totally a fair observation 100 yep
[5234.88 --> 5242.16]  um the reality of it was though is that a 3080 ti was never going to be that so we reviewed the 3080 ti
[5242.16 --> 5247.28]  as a 3080 ti but i think that's a really good point that we could have brought up is
[5247.28 --> 5254.16]  yeah sure but where is a 3050 yep that's a really really really good point uh ethan says talked to my
[5254.16 --> 5260.48]  friends in 3d art they all said they're going 3090 or would settle on a 30 3080 but that the 3080 ti
[5260.48 --> 5267.60]  makes no sense for the price well i don't really i actually just totally don't really get that if
[5267.60 --> 5273.28]  they're in 3d art then yeah sure go 3090 because you need that vram but i don't really see how the
[5273.28 --> 5278.56]  3080 figures into it at all especially because you need the vram that's a weird you can't actually get
[5278.56 --> 5286.24]  it for the msrp so uh the difference in price between the 3080 and the 3080 ti is only a theoretical
[5286.24 --> 5290.08]  difference in price the way that most people are talking about it it's not real world
[5290.08 --> 5300.16]  um stem serban says does msrp matter for amd uh they have exactly the same uh pressures on them
[5300.16 --> 5306.48]  um like their their cards are also like okay sure so the msr here let's play a little game let's play a
[5306.48 --> 5321.60]  little game called buy the rx um hold on a second radeon rx 6900 xt okay we're gonna play this game
[5322.40 --> 5326.88]  so the msrp for this card is 999 us dollars
[5329.12 --> 5330.72]  okay that's nice
[5330.72 --> 5339.20]  um that's not what they cost and even at these prices they're not in stock you got to go all the
[5339.20 --> 5347.52]  way up to 2700 to actually add one to your cart am i happy about this is this good no but in the
[5347.52 --> 5355.44]  context of that pricing for the 6900 xt the uh 38 3080 ti looks pretty good like what do you guys want
[5355.44 --> 5370.64]  from me uh all right uh jesse says my gigabyte eagle 3880 ti doesn't fit in my case anyone have a
[5370.64 --> 5376.48]  founder's edition to trade me this is really not the right place for that message jesse good luck though
[5376.48 --> 5388.32]  oh man um oh man jack meyer says luke must have been gaslit before this segment linus seems to be
[5388.32 --> 5398.32]  defending nvidia and trashing gamers nexus which is a wild take i i love steve i i don't know i i've
[5398.32 --> 5404.40]  steve's freaking fantastic um gamers nexus is fantastic i don't think linus was trashing them either i don't
[5404.40 --> 5408.80]  think that's how that went at all they said you trashed them oh no line trashing oh no they said
[5408.80 --> 5412.72]  i trashed they said i trashed steve apparently yeah i was gonna be like hold on wait a second so i don't
[5412.72 --> 5418.16]  think like trash steve i didn't get to hear literally a word that steve said due to the mic setup um but
[5418.16 --> 5424.40]  i'm assuming there wasn't like a a fight there uh like that's not the conversation that's going on that
[5424.40 --> 5428.72]  linus mentioned earlier in the show a lot of times when when someone points out like oh this person's a
[5428.72 --> 5434.16]  shill it's very often not always but very often because the person saying that is a fanboy
[5434.16 --> 5439.20]  and that paints their vision and i think that might be happening here there there's a disagreement
[5439.20 --> 5444.56]  in how things went but there isn't a fight um i don't like that the thing is so expensive
[5445.20 --> 5450.72]  but i understand why and it's not for me and it's probably not for you and that's like its whole own
[5450.72 --> 5457.52]  conversation right like i i don't care if a louis vuitton bag is fifty thousand dollars i genuinely have
[5457.52 --> 5463.76]  no clue whatsoever how much they cost because i don't care it's not for me it doesn't matter
[5464.48 --> 5469.68]  i do care if backpacks for some reason no i don't i don't buy backpacks i have the same backpack for
[5469.68 --> 5476.88]  like 11 years that i gave you for free yes so cheap so maybe that doesn't really count but like i do care
[5476.88 --> 5482.08]  of something that i generally buy and is is which is basically always going to be a value for dollar
[5482.08 --> 5488.88]  purchase uh not necessarily always but basically always um i do care if that thing goes up in price
[5489.60 --> 5492.88]  um and that sucks we've talked about that with graphics cards in the past because that's happened
[5492.88 --> 5497.60]  there's been generational jumps that are much more than inflation and we've pointed it out and been
[5497.60 --> 5503.68]  unhappy about it yeah in this case i don't think it is they took their top end part they replaced it
[5503.68 --> 5510.48]  with a different top end part that is cheaper so yeah we you know we already said the 3090 is not a great deal
[5510.48 --> 5517.52]  but in the context of the current market the 3080 ti is looking pretty good i i didn't make the rules
[5517.52 --> 5523.60]  for that uh dima says as a lifelong apple fanboy i hate that your criticism of apple is always so
[5523.60 --> 5531.68]  accurate thanks i guess my criticism of apple comes from a place of love not necessarily for apple directly
[5531.68 --> 5536.32]  but for tech and the issue that i have with apple is that they so often set trends that are blindly
[5536.32 --> 5540.24]  followed by the rest of the tech industry that i have to be upset when they do something
[5540.24 --> 5546.88]  because it's if it's the wrong direction or it's anti-consumer or whatever the case may or anti-environment
[5546.88 --> 5555.12]  it's something that is going to become a plague that infects the entire tech space that's a lot
[5555.12 --> 5559.44]  of the time where my criticism for apple comes from and then the other part of the time it comes from
[5559.44 --> 5567.52]  their complete and utter arrogance and disdain for the demands of their users like you know something as
[5567.52 --> 5575.28]  simple as you know we actually shot our review of the new ipad pro today and it's just this amazing
[5576.08 --> 5586.32]  just unbelievable piece of hardware like wow and it doesn't have a progress bar on network file
[5586.32 --> 5596.08]  transfers because you you know like it's just the conscious decisions that apple makes to not make
[5596.08 --> 5603.84]  their products compete with each other or not make them too good for the users i just because it violates
[5603.84 --> 5611.04]  some arbitrary philosophical up their own butt nonsense like i just i i just i can't i just have such a
[5611.04 --> 5622.72]  hard time with it um all right oh the lt profile pic was linus cosplaying jobs yeah that was that was
[5623.60 --> 5628.80]  that's a long time ago it's funny though but yeah uh steve says finally pulled the trigger on an ek 3090
[5628.80 --> 5632.72]  water block for my graduation hopefully i don't break my only graphics card that would be really bad
[5633.52 --> 5640.08]  that would be such a shame oh my goodness you'll probably be fine but yeah that would be uh that'd
[5640.08 --> 5646.00]  be horrible lewis says uh best buy did an in-store only launch i could afford it so i bought a 3080 ti
[5646.00 --> 5651.12]  i was ready to pay that price for a 3080 anyway people have been annoying but i'm happy with my card
[5651.12 --> 5658.32]  thanks for saying this there's there you go there you go you might not be lewis but lewis is out there
[5659.52 --> 5666.08]  nick says however you see it aib cards at crazy markups versus msrp is a pr problem 100 nvidia could
[5666.08 --> 5671.12]  cap aib prices and price appropriately to protect their image yeah but that would cost nvidia their
[5671.12 --> 5677.36]  sweet sweet margin you get all you have to do is look at nvidia's uh nvidia's earnings their public
[5677.36 --> 5682.16]  company to see how much more profit they make compared to their partners on their products
[5682.16 --> 5690.40]  oh boy oh man there's wow there's so many super chats today nope says i've never seen a youtube
[5690.40 --> 5695.12]  channel like ltt it's been awesome to see you guys grow as a company uh keep it up you're truly
[5695.12 --> 5700.72]  poggers hey thanks so much i think poggers is a good thing uh melody says yeah yeah i thought it was
[5700.72 --> 5704.72]  refreshing to see different tech influencers bringing different perspectives to the table i
[5704.72 --> 5708.88]  really appreciated how your take wasn't the easy slam video it could have been nuance and diversity of
[5708.88 --> 5713.60]  opinion is a good thing um yeah we could have just slammed it we could have just said it's expensive
[5713.60 --> 5717.92]  it's bad uh but not everything that's expensive is inherently bad and you have to review everything
[5717.92 --> 5724.32]  within the context of the current state uh chai says hey if you're still looking for motorcycle airbags
[5724.32 --> 5728.88]  you should look into the helite turtle it doesn't have a subscription service its action is mechanical
[5728.88 --> 5735.68]  and it inflates with a replaceable co2 cylinder that sounds awesome and sean d says the only difference
[5735.68 --> 5744.24]  between a 30d and a 3080 ti is a ga102 with more passing sms two additional one gigabyte gddr6 chips
[5744.24 --> 5751.84]  the rest is the same card it costs them 30 more to make than 3080 but they charge 500 more guess what that ain't new
[5754.32 --> 5764.24]  the difference between an extreme edition cpu back in the day and the 400 you know cheapo one
[5764.24 --> 5771.84]  was a little bit more cash that was good and and they were ludicrous i laughed at most people that
[5771.84 --> 5777.04]  bought them unless you got it through the retail edge program because you're an employee at some store
[5777.04 --> 5784.08]  and then you got it at like a ridiculously lower price sean d it's time it's time to take the red pill man
[5784.32 --> 5791.28]  it's time to take the red pill because uh every every everything is it's all the same it's all made of sand
[5791.28 --> 5796.12]  it's all made of sand sorry it's just sand
[5796.12 --> 5804.48]  all right uh thanks alex pot van wait a second what is that that's not that alex pot van is it
[5804.48 --> 5809.60]  did he send a super chat i don't know what to spend my survey rewards on
[5809.60 --> 5815.76]  hold on a second is there a way to like this is there a way to like go to this user's profile is
[5815.76 --> 5823.44]  it actually that one um okay usually if you are who i think you are i'm the one who's supposed to
[5823.44 --> 5828.72]  give you the money not the other way around you said survey rewards yeah but still i don't think
[5828.72 --> 5833.04]  it's cash i don't i don't think you can pull it out in cash oh really okay i think it's like you spend it
[5833.04 --> 5837.60]  within the i i could be wrong but i think you're supposed to like spend it within the ecosystem like a like a
[5837.60 --> 5842.48]  credit kind of thing okay neat interesting all right so thanks for tuning into the wan show
