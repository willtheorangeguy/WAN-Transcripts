[0.00 → 2.68] Did you resume?
[2.68 → 9.22] I did. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the WAN show. We have a fantastic show for you guys today.
[9.40 → 16.16] Actually lots of fun topics today. We're going to be talking through AMD's Zen 5 Strip Point,
[16.52 → 21.98] which is apparently going to be a 3 nanometre processor. That is not many nanometres.
[22.70 → 29.84] That's like a few nanometres. That's it. There's some pretty big news on the gaming
[29.84 → 37.22] monitor front. There's going to be the first 390 hertz monitor coming. And what else we got today?
[37.98 → 46.16] Much Samsung wow plus 350 Ti. Different screens. Very interesting different screens. Also,
[47.10 → 51.70] games. Are your games stuttering at home? Are you having stuttering issues? Blame Windows.
[52.24 → 54.98] Nothing else. Only Windows. Specifically Bill Gates.
[54.98 → 60.52] We'll talk about that. Are we going to do the whole like base camp imploding conversation?
[61.34 → 62.10] We can.
[62.84 → 66.98] All right. Yeah. We'll talk about that later. Let's roll the intro.
[66.98 → 68.48] We'll tiptoe around that topic.
[68.74 → 71.72] Yeah. It seems like it might be a tender topic.
[72.24 → 72.52] Yeah.
[72.68 → 74.84] Tender. Yeah. Get teddies.
[74.84 → 104.74] Got a lot of great sponsors for you all today as well. Word Pass, as well as MSI and Ridge Wallet are all sponsoring the LAN show today.
[104.74 → 108.80] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic? I can't remember what it is.
[109.14 → 112.88] Yes. AMD is not ripping off Intel.
[113.22 → 114.72] Allow me to explain.
[114.92 → 120.52] It would be pretty easy to say, oh, hey, wait, hold on a second.
[121.10 → 125.78] I mean, AMD is releasing a hybrid CPU.
[125.78 → 142.68] That just sounds a lot like Intel Alder Lake, which is the codename for their 12th generation core series processors, which are going to use the use high performance golden cove cores alongside power saving grace Mont cores.
[142.68 → 148.16] With the idea being that you get performance when you need it and power saving when you don't.
[148.94 → 154.02] But in fact, Intel is not the first one to have that idea.
[154.20 → 160.62] And there's a lot else going on with their Zen 5 architecture that has really nothing to do with what Intel's doing.
[160.62 → 172.74] So first things first, Zen 5 will apparently be based on TSM3's N3 process node, which I think they're just kind of changing up the nomenclature on us.
[172.80 → 175.36] I actually didn't know that they call them.
[175.46 → 178.90] OK, maybe they're not because they're referring to their 7 nanometre as N7.
[179.22 → 181.32] So I've just never heard that branding for it before.
[181.44 → 181.86] Go figure.
[181.86 → 188.52] So their N3 process node is two full nodes away from AMD's current 7 nanometre node with TSMC.
[188.72 → 196.10] And it's claimed to be 1.7 times as dense as 5 nanometers, which is itself 1.8 times as dense as 7 nanometers.
[196.58 → 205.36] And we are expecting somewhere in the neighbourhood of a 50 plus percent increase in power efficiency compared to 7 nanometers.
[206.36 → 210.50] And wow, so 15 percent faster than 15 percent faster.
[210.50 → 212.94] So what would that be?
[213.16 → 219.34] Something like 35 or so, 35 or so percent faster than 7 nanometers as well.
[220.20 → 220.50] Whew!
[221.10 → 225.52] Now AMD has a tendency to do major architecture changes in their odd numbered releases.
[225.68 → 231.08] So Zen 5 is expected to be a big update over Zen 4 with significant memory subsystem changes.
[231.20 → 235.74] But the big new feature is, of course, big little or hybrid chip design.
[235.74 → 243.82] And we've seen this before in ARM CPUs in particular, SOCS, I guess I should say, because there's a lot more than just a CPU in them.
[243.88 → 249.74] But your phone, assuming you have one that was built in, I don't know, Luke, five years?
[250.00 → 250.32] Six?
[250.62 → 251.14] Quite a while.
[251.14 → 257.02] When did the first big little ARM designs show up?
[259.12 → 260.08] First release.
[260.50 → 261.06] Looking it up.
[261.28 → 262.34] I'm Googling this.
[263.06 → 264.04] ARM big little.
[264.18 → 264.80] Here we go.
[265.60 → 267.02] Heterogeneous, blah, blah, etc.
[267.36 → 267.74] Come on.
[267.78 → 269.36] Give me a year, ladies and gentlemen.
[270.22 → 271.20] Give me a year.
[271.90 → 272.54] I don't know.
[272.62 → 273.24] It doesn't matter.
[273.34 → 274.90] We're not going to be able to do that.
[274.90 → 292.18] But it's been around for a while in mobile, with the main benefit being that you can shut off, or at least mostly shut off, those big, powerful cores when you're doing something like periodically checking for notifications for email or whatever.
[292.18 → 298.54] And then when it's time to retouch a photo, then boom, the heavy cores kick in, and you're ready to rock.
[298.54 → 304.52] And Apple's M1, very recently, was the first to bring this to the desktop.
[304.80 → 308.12] Intel will follow according to their roadmap later this year.
[308.54 → 311.28] And then Zen 5 will apparently rock.
[312.16 → 312.72] Interesting.
[312.92 → 317.12] So the code name for the Zen 5 APU is going to be Strip Point.
[317.20 → 324.86] It makes total sense that this is something that would be more of an APU-focused feature because that's the kind of CPU.
[325.98 → 326.54] AMD.
[326.72 → 327.46] AMD kills me.
[327.46 → 330.70] An APU is the kind of CPU.
[331.70 → 332.12] So no.
[332.42 → 334.12] According to AMD, it's an APU.
[334.40 → 339.16] According to Intel, it's a CPU because most of their consumer chips just have graphics on them anyway.
[339.64 → 342.44] But that's what makes something an APU, according to AMD.
[343.06 → 350.58] So an APU is the kind of CPU that would end up in something like an office computer.
[350.58 → 372.52] And you guys might not know this, but there are some new efficiency standards coming, particularly in places like Japan, that are going to force mass production computers to implement new power saving ideas like integrating the 12 volt to 5 and 3.3 volt conversion on.
[372.52 → 379.56] So did I say so moving that DC to DC conversion onto the motherboard instead of doing it in the power supply?
[379.56 → 385.82] We saw this with Intel's 12 VO like prototype power supply and some AS Rock board.
[385.90 → 387.52] And it made a huge difference.
[387.62 → 389.98] It absolutely blew me away how much of a difference it made.
[389.98 → 401.34] And doing something like this, big little, is going to help meet those kinds of efficiency standards because one of the big things that it improved upon was idle efficiency.
[401.34 → 410.34] So actually, when that system was under load, the power consumption was relatively close to just a normal system.
[410.34 → 414.30] Because when you're under load, the things that kick in are going to be your CPU and your GPU.
[414.94 → 417.88] Both of those are powered predominantly off of 12 volts.
[418.28 → 421.06] But everything else is running all the time.
[421.06 → 431.88] And so it's your idle power consumption where you're going to actually save by not having those low voltage lines where you're going to, the lower the voltage is, the less efficient it is.
[431.96 → 442.38] That's why the power lines coming into your house, for example, are, well, not into your house because the ones coming into your house are actually typically around the same voltages, what your house actually runs.
[442.42 → 448.74] But the ones coming into the substation in your neighbourhood run at much higher voltage than the lines that are going to your house.
[448.74 → 453.32] Because it's just way less efficient to run at low voltages.
[453.62 → 463.50] So this is going to help with that because AMD is going to have these CPUs that will absolutely sip power when they're not really doing anything.
[464.20 → 467.30] And then we'll still have, hopefully, the horses.
[467.58 → 470.26] I mean, eight big cores are still pretty good.
[470.34 → 472.50] I mean, we're talking, oh, yeah, and also mobile.
[472.80 → 476.50] So they'll have decent GPUs built right into the CPU.
[477.08 → 478.42] That's what makes it an APU.
[478.74 → 482.08] They'll have these big little CPU cores.
[482.22 → 487.12] So they will sip power, and they will, what was the other thing I was going to say?
[487.42 → 488.90] Yeah, well, basically, I guess that's it.
[489.32 → 492.24] So they have an expected release date of 2024.
[493.42 → 503.40] And as for naming, AMD's Zen 3 Plus Refresh, codename Warhol, is rumoured to be delayed or cancelled with an accelerated Zen 4 launch instead.
[503.40 → 508.58] So in terms of branding, Zen 3 Refresh, Ry zen 6,000?
[509.24 → 512.50] Zen 4 and Zen 5, then Ry zen 7 and 8,000?
[512.92 → 519.06] And then maybe, or maybe Zen 3 Refresh would be like XT, like 5,000 XT.
[519.06 → 521.68] And then Zen 4 and 5 or 6 and 7,000?
[521.74 → 522.34] We don't know.
[522.96 → 530.66] I just, I really wish that AMD hadn't screwed things up, you know, 20 years ago with their Plus branding.
[530.88 → 533.34] Because that would have made it really simple these days.
[533.40 → 533.88] Right, Luke?
[534.44 → 535.98] They could have just gone, okay.
[536.12 → 536.44] It was good.
[536.44 → 541.14] Yeah, every new Zen architecture, you get a new thousand number.
[541.46 → 544.76] And then every Plus architecture, you put a Plus at the end.
[545.54 → 547.12] But they screwed it up.
[547.46 → 548.14] They screwed it up.
[548.32 → 552.80] They had Pluses at the end of four-digit numbers way back then, and that wasn't what it meant.
[553.06 → 554.28] So now it's all ruined.
[554.60 → 558.10] Not that there's any continuity in these product naming schemes anyway.
[558.22 → 560.08] I mean, they're clearly all making it up as they go along.
[560.24 → 561.14] What is RTX?
[561.14 → 561.42] RTX?
[563.86 → 566.90] I mean, it's having cores.
[566.90 → 567.72] That one's not too bad.
[567.78 → 568.86] Real-time ray tracing.
[569.02 → 569.82] That one's kind of okay.
[571.04 → 571.96] Okay, fine.
[572.14 → 572.60] Okay, fine.
[573.08 → 578.42] So I'm reading in here a lot of talk about desktop processors, but this seems way more like a mobile play.
[578.48 → 578.94] What do you think?
[579.42 → 580.26] Oh, absolutely.
[580.46 → 583.56] I mean, that's where you're going to get the vast majority of the benefits.
[583.56 → 589.34] So being able to kick in those high-performance cores when it's time to hook up an external GPU and play a game.
[589.34 → 602.70] But being able to run on those four cores while you're, you know, editing a text document in Google Docs or something like that is pretty much the only chance that x86 has of getting competitive with ARM in laptops.
[602.70 → 602.88] Yeah.
[602.88 → 605.52] Which, all of a sudden, it's going to be a freaking thing.
[605.58 → 607.24] I mean, we talked about this last week.
[607.54 → 611.58] Not only is ARM already a thing in notebooks.
[611.76 → 617.36] I mean, it's not like Qualcomm doesn't have notebook design wins that are out there, although I don't think anyone cares about them.
[617.36 → 623.40] But more importantly, I mean, NVIDIA is clearly working on a notebook CPU that is going to be ARM-based.
[623.96 → 630.52] So once that starts to happen, I mean, Apple has already made the transition to ARM for mobile and desktops.
[630.72 → 632.48] Well, Apple's moving to ARM with everything.
[632.92 → 637.64] All of a sudden, the barbarians are at the gates, x86.
[637.96 → 640.58] Like, you got to catch up here.
[641.08 → 643.68] It's been years since Big Little existed on ARM.
[643.68 → 650.66] I'm assuming there are technical challenges that made it very difficult, but that doesn't change the fact that you're just, like, going to have to do it.
[651.10 → 651.26] Yeah.
[651.60 → 661.18] Now, in terms of what Intel's going to have to compete, a mobile Alder Lake processor has actually already leaked on Geek bench with six big and eight little cores,
[661.72 → 666.68] a base frequency of 800 megahertz, and a max frequency of 4.7 gigahertz.
[666.68 → 675.04] Rumours suggest that the desktop SKU will be a 16 core layout with an eight plus eight configuration,
[675.24 → 684.62] which means that Intel might not be performance competitive with AMD on the desktop for at least another year.
[684.62 → 685.62] I mean...
[685.62 → 687.72] I think it's going to be more than that.
[687.92 → 689.72] Well, I said at least.
[690.08 → 690.38] Yeah.
[690.50 → 694.26] In my defence, I put a lot of emphasis on the at least.
[694.26 → 694.42] You did.
[694.74 → 695.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[695.50 → 696.44] Okay, I'll give you that.
[696.56 → 698.04] But, yeah, I think it's going to be a while.
[698.96 → 700.94] So, it's rumoured to support...
[700.94 → 701.76] It's not rumoured.
[701.84 → 704.12] It's, like, almost certain to support DDR5.
[704.12 → 710.20] So, it's going to come on a new LGA 1700 socket, which will be totally incompatible with current coolers.
[710.66 → 711.68] I mean, it was a good run.
[711.92 → 718.94] You know, you can criticize Intel all you want for changing their board, making you change your board every time you want to upgrade your CPU or whatever.
[719.46 → 725.12] But one thing they have done really well is maintained cooler compatibility for...
[726.64 → 729.36] I mean, when did Clarksdale come out?
[731.36 → 733.84] Intel Clarksdale CPU launch.
[734.12 → 736.84] That was in 2010.
[737.58 → 745.32] For over 10 years, you've been able to reuse your Intel CPU, your, like, after market Intel CPU.
[745.42 → 746.98] Probably haven't even really thought about it.
[747.40 → 749.14] That's pretty cool.
[750.00 → 760.48] Now, AMD, depending on how your cooler manufacturer implemented their compatibility with AMD, AMD actually can go back even farther.
[760.48 → 776.88] So, if you have an AMD cooler that uses the clips around the like, the plastic brackets around the socket, like, just the little hooks, you can go all the way back to socket 754, which launched in 2003.
[776.88 → 779.60] So, Intel managed...
[779.60 → 779.98] So, Intel managed...
[779.98 → 785.34] AMD is going on 15 years pretty soon of cooler compatibility.
[785.76 → 787.60] It does kind of help when you take a...
[788.18 → 790.66] Essentially a sabbatical in the middle of that, though.
[790.94 → 791.62] That's true.
[791.72 → 792.24] That's true.
[792.34 → 796.36] There was a bit of a gap in the like, having CPUs that anyone cared about.
[797.72 → 798.80] Sort of...
[798.80 → 799.08] Yeah.
[799.08 → 800.28] Excuse me.
[802.50 → 809.42] And to be clear, AMD's, like, compatibility, if you don't use the little hooks, is...
[809.42 → 810.16] No, that's a mess.
[810.24 → 818.28] Because socket 754 and, if I recall correctly, 939 both used two screws, like, two bolts through the board into the backplate.
[818.50 → 822.04] And then AM whatever started being four.
[822.32 → 825.72] And then AM4 actually moved them, if I recall correctly.
[825.72 → 827.78] So, it's, like, two this way and, like, two kind of like that.
[827.84 → 832.10] And then, of course, there's the enthusiast socket, thread ripper, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[832.14 → 832.82] That's not compatible.
[832.92 → 834.48] But then that was true on Intel as well.
[834.88 → 839.32] On the server side, the mounting holes did move around a fair bit in that time period.
[840.46 → 842.00] This is a long aside.
[842.38 → 843.44] Not very important.
[843.58 → 848.36] The new socket will need additional pins to support USB 4 and PCI Express Gen 5.
[848.36 → 856.04] And AMD will also be changing sockets because, you know, these new connectivity standards.
[856.34 → 858.24] So, AM4 is going away.
[858.40 → 862.42] But we have no information about what AM5 might look like.
[862.44 → 867.88] And it's actually been rumoured that AMD might go LGA instead of sticking with pins.
[868.30 → 871.56] Which, I mean, Luke, how do you feel about that, Luke?
[871.56 → 875.42] I mean, you've had to personally repair the pins on an AM4 CPU.
[875.74 → 876.20] I'm upset.
[876.42 → 876.82] I'm upset.
[876.92 → 878.00] I had to deal with the struggles.
[878.12 → 879.40] Everyone else should have to deal with it, too.
[879.90 → 881.42] No, no, I think that's a good thing.
[881.50 → 885.44] Can I just take a moment to talk about what a big load of horse shit that argument is?
[887.20 → 888.34] Yeah, it's terrible.
[888.54 → 890.82] You hear it for so many things.
[891.20 → 898.20] You know, we shouldn't forgive any student loan debt because, you know, I had to pay it.
[898.20 → 904.66] Like, never mind that, you know, your generation's student loans were a fraction of what they are now.
[904.80 → 912.42] Not to mention that you didn't have to go nearly as deep into your post-secondary education in order to have meaningful credentials.
[913.46 → 917.72] Like, okay, whoa, this could be a very long aside.
[917.72 → 929.48] But, like, you know, it's very frustrating to me that, you know, in the 60s, in the 70s, a high school diploma actually was considered a job credential.
[930.00 → 934.14] Now it's basically considered, you know, uncomfortable toilet paper.
[934.36 → 938.84] And if you don't have a bachelor's degree, don't even bother for a lot of positions.
[938.84 → 950.56] And then in the same way, what used to be a bachelor's degree type of position back in the, you know, mid to latter part of the 20th century, now they're going to ask for a master's.
[950.56 → 953.48] So on the one hand, school costs have gone like this.
[953.70 → 957.74] And the requirement for credentials has gone like this.
[957.74 → 964.10] So not only does this generation, the Boomer generation, have to deal with the fact that they had to pay more for school.
[964.28 → 965.68] They had to pay for its longer.
[966.12 → 967.38] Their rent was more expensive.
[967.62 → 969.36] The general cost of living is way higher.
[969.64 → 977.88] Like, it's, here I am going on a very, this is a very political, it's a political conversation, Luke.
[977.98 → 979.86] We're starting a political conversation here.
[979.86 → 991.38] But to me, just like, you know, having a functioning society where people can afford to live based on, you know, going to work and not be starving is not political.
[991.56 → 992.50] That's just basic.
[993.14 → 996.08] Some people are kind of pushing against those aspects.
[996.08 → 1004.28] Like some people are trying to make sure that they weigh portfolios and examples of work quite highly during hiring processes and stuff.
[1004.38 → 1004.52] Sure.
[1004.58 → 1006.48] I mean, we do, but not everyone does.
[1007.10 → 1007.66] No, for sure.
[1007.80 → 1008.72] And it is harder.
[1008.72 → 1013.32] Like, I understand why someone trying to be lazy wouldn't want to do that.
[1013.40 → 1018.84] Because, like, it's pretty easy to go into someone's resume and be like, yep, that's a bachelor from a reputable school.
[1019.04 → 1019.40] Cool.
[1020.20 → 1031.08] I mean, except that you might, that person, you know, because a lot of, just because the school is reputable doesn't mean that that program wasn't basically an adult daycare.
[1031.08 → 1031.52] Yeah.
[1031.52 → 1032.00] Yeah.
[1032.00 → 1042.58] You know, we've, we've hired people, or not hired, we have interviewed people based on their credentials who ended up being absolute hot garbage that we would never consider hiring.
[1043.06 → 1043.08] So.
[1043.20 → 1043.38] Yeah.
[1043.56 → 1043.94] So am I.
[1043.94 → 1045.62] This is great.
[1045.62 → 1045.66] I mean, I'm not.
[1045.66 → 1045.94] I'm not.
[1045.94 → 1046.06] I'm not.
[1046.06 → 1046.62] I'm not.
[1046.62 → 1046.66] I'm not.
[1046.66 → 1047.06] I'm not.
[1047.06 → 1048.06] I'm not.
[1048.06 → 1049.06] I'm not.
[1049.06 → 1050.06] I'm not.
[1050.06 → 1051.06] I'm not.
[1051.06 → 1052.06] I'm not.
[1052.06 → 1069.72] I'm not.
[1070.84 → 1071.08] Okay.
[1071.08 → 1075.68] God deck.
[1075.68 → 1082.00] a radical idea i just you hear stories about like oh yeah when I went to university I like
[1082.00 → 1085.12] paid for my whole degree didn't have student loans when I came out of it lived in a
[1085.68 → 1089.20] decently large basement suite by myself and worked a part-time job like
[1090.16 → 1092.56] on the weekends to pay for it all, and it's just like
[1094.80 → 1100.16] what fantasy land did you live in yeah it's called the 80s Luke yeah yeah yeah
[1100.16 → 1107.12] we're pretty far off of uh three nanometre process nodes though yeah yeah yeah well you know what
[1107.12 → 1111.68] it's not that far off of one of the other topics that we said that okay hold on a second hold on
[1111.68 → 1116.96] a second no no no, no no, no that is incorrect someone in the twitch chat's like it all comes
[1116.96 → 1125.28] down to overpopulation no it doesn't know it comes down to and I'm not singling out any individuals
[1125.28 → 1131.44] it comes down to a particular generation of people swooping in like locusts consuming absolutely
[1131.44 → 1135.28] everything in their path and then putting up obstacles and barriers to make sure that nobody
[1135.28 → 1144.88] else can do the same thing I mean in this in the 60s in the 70s zoning like city zoning was hardly a thing
[1145.84 → 1151.92] so if you needed to you know build a bunch of inexpensive housing you basically just YOLO'd it
[1151.92 → 1157.76] and housing was affordable now to be clear a lot of the protections that are put in place to you know
[1157.76 → 1165.68] prevent soil erosion into rivers and to make sure that you know forest replanting is more sustainable or
[1165.68 → 1173.20] like whatever a lot of that makes sense but a lot of it doesn't a lot of the time you end up with a bunch
[1173.20 → 1181.76] of NIMBY that prevents making things more affordable because a certain generation has particularly
[1181.76 → 1186.96] here in Canada the vast majority of their wealth tied up in real estate and doesn't want to see it
[1186.96 → 1194.40] impacted because that's what they banked on, but unfortunately it is basically a vampiric effect
[1194.96 → 1202.64] on the next generation because them holding on to that wealth means that the next generation is basically
[1202.64 → 1209.52] just throwing all their money away on rent and interest payments so I'm sorry this is this has become
[1210.08 → 1217.12] this has become yeah and like Ramona there was an article that came out fairly recently that was
[1217.12 → 1221.44] like I don't remember who's millennials or what category it was, but it was like you might just have
[1221.44 → 1226.88] to wait for your inheritance to be able to buy a house, and it was like I had a really well I moved
[1226.88 → 1232.08] recently as you know so I had a very interesting conversation with a mortgage broker recently uh not
[1232.08 → 1237.76] because we ended up using a mortgage broker because middle middlemen never actually are a better deal
[1237.76 → 1243.28] they're just really useful for comparison shopping and putting pressure on the actual banks that
[1243.28 → 1248.32] actually issue the mortgages so anyway had a fascinating conversation um that basically went
[1248.32 → 1254.64] yeah like in this housing boom that's been going on in Canada right now probably a solid and turns out
[1254.64 → 1259.04] the real numbers because there's an article that came out recently that had sort of some real numbers but
[1259.04 → 1266.32] they what how they felt anecdotally was about half of the people buying houses at these ludicrous prices
[1266.32 → 1272.16] like Canadian housing has gone up like 23 in the last year something stupid like that yeah
[1272.16 → 1279.84] um and to be clear to be clear Canada ain't overpopulated all right not even close yeah
[1279.84 → 1285.68] let's just cut off that conversation right about now um I just want to give two quick things to it
[1285.68 → 1292.24] sorry if you look at a population map of Canada it's very funny because essentially the entire population
[1292.24 → 1298.08] is a very, very thin line against the US border all the way across Canada it's just this really thin
[1298.08 → 1304.56] line the other one is we still as far as I know have fewer people in all of Canada than just California
[1304.56 → 1311.12] so it's way less yeah it's way less um so anyway they were saying about half of the people buying
[1311.12 → 1316.56] houses at these ridiculous prices were only able to afford the down payments because that the previous
[1316.56 → 1325.44] generation that shall not be named views housing as this infallible sort of investment that basically
[1325.44 → 1332.08] carried them through their entire lives because as wages eroded relative to the cost of living they
[1332.08 → 1337.92] were able to lean on the equity that was built up in these home investments yeah home is
[1337.92 → 1342.24] supposed to be a place to live it's not supposed to be your primary form of investment that's a whole other
[1342.24 → 1347.92] conversation, but they believe so strongly in it, and they are leaving this money to the
[1347.92 → 1352.08] younger generation and then kind of dumping it right back into this and propping up this bubble
[1352.72 → 1361.12] it's horrifying, and it's not tech related no one seems to care so far but uh uh uh Travis says the
[1361.12 → 1365.76] rich like being rich Linus that's that's why it is the way it is the funny thing about it though is it's
[1365.76 → 1373.52] not this particular problem is not necessarily the rich we're talking about people who are house rich
[1373.52 → 1379.44] that doesn't necessarily mean just because someone's net worth is a million dollars does not mean that
[1379.44 → 1386.40] they actually have a million dollars of liquidity like when you live in a house that is worth a million
[1386.40 → 1395.28] dollars if everyone say for example were to get old and pass away you know within a short span of time
[1396.16 → 1402.88] that that value has to depreciate unless something kind of weird and crazy happens in order to prop it
[1402.88 → 1407.68] up you don't actually have that cash so you need somewhere to live so when you sell it you have to
[1407.68 → 1415.20] put it right back into somewhere to live or when you sell it a bunch of others are going to sell like
[1415.20 → 1418.08] from the same cohort are going to sell it around the same time and there's going to have to be some
[1418.08 → 1424.16] kind of crash so just saying the rich is too simplistic but I also understand where this resentment comes
[1424.16 → 1430.24] from because you've got literal generations of people between the millennials and boomers now
[1430.24 → 1438.40] that see the very idea of being able to own a detached home as for the rich it wasn't it wasn't even
[1438.40 → 1446.64] like that that long ago you know when my wife and I bought our house it was 11
[1448.56 → 1455.28] 11 years ago Luke do you know how much we paid for our house which I have heard people call a mansion
[1455.28 → 1462.08] in YouTube comments yeah it's not a mansion it's about 2200 square feet it's not actually that big for
[1462.08 → 1466.96] a detached home it has a really nice yard though which is because it was built in the 80s back when
[1467.68 → 1472.00] you could like to build houses with a yard and actually make money as a developer it's a whole other
[1472.00 → 1480.24] conversation um, but we paid 580 000 Canadian dollars so that's around like 475 us at the current exchange
[1480.24 → 1487.20] rate that's not entirely unreasonable nowadays you'd be lucky to get a town house and that would be
[1487.20 → 1496.08] further out of the city at half the size for that money it has only been 11 years it's not sustainable
[1496.08 → 1504.48] it's absolutely disgusting i am rooting for a housing crash I can't wait for it because like when
[1504.48 → 1511.76] I say I want my kids to be able to afford to live in this city I'm speaking figuratively um my kids
[1511.76 → 1517.84] parents will be able to help them out that's the way it is we've we've been very lucky we've worked
[1517.84 → 1522.72] very hard we've had a great degree of success my kids aren't going anywhere unless they want to
[1524.00 → 1530.72] but it's not just about that what about their whole way of living um
[1532.24 → 1536.88] yeah nacho warrior we can talk about that too it's a whole separate issue the whole investors causing
[1536.88 → 1542.64] serious problems and the whole fact that you've got uh I think it's oh man what is it like one in
[1542.64 → 1548.40] every five homeowners in Vancouver owns more than one home that's that's pretty problematic anyway yeah
[1548.40 → 1554.08] I'm talking about like the way of living what if my kids could afford to stay here but literally
[1554.08 → 1561.36] everyone they ever knew in their entire life moved away because they cannot afford to be here like and it
[1561.36 → 1568.56] like and it is it makes a ton of sense to move away one of my best friends in high school lives on the
[1568.56 → 1577.92] island now because and get this he's a doctor I'm not talking he has a PhD in like you know mineral
[1577.92 → 1585.52] studies or something like he is a medical doctor practicing, and he was like yep this makes no sense
[1585.52 → 1593.60] see you later now he's a he's a king of pragmatism um so just even though he could afford to live here
[1593.60 → 1600.48] he chooses not to because it doesn't make any sense you know my sister-in-law no longer lives in the city
[1600.48 → 1606.72] that means my kids don't see their cousins so the effects of the lack of affordability are far
[1606.72 → 1614.64] reaching anyway um why don't we talk about something else for a little bit the first 390 hertz monitors
[1614.64 → 1620.16] coming should we talk about the first 390 hertz monitor sure let's lets all right hit me what
[1620.16 → 1624.80] are the d's hit me with the not that you're going to be able to buy a graphics card that can run it
[1624.80 → 1636.24] but the acer nitro xv2 is a 360 hertz IPS panel that can overclock to a whopping 390 hertz it's 1080p
[1636.24 → 1643.92] but fast as heck, and it's 24.5 inches it has a 0.5 to 1 ms response time, and it's rumoured price
[1643.92 → 1653.36] is to be 730 us dollars acer pulls away from the competition by an extra 30 hertz uh there are other
[1653.36 → 1660.16] 360 hertz, but this is the first one that can like officially OC to 390. Asus has a rogue swift that runs
[1660.16 → 1666.48] at 360 and there's the alienware 25 gaming monitors as well since it requires an overclock it might not
[1666.48 → 1671.92] be guaranteed to be 100 stable but considering they're saying like it can overclock to 390 I think
[1671.92 → 1682.56] it'd be pretty surprising if it wasn't uh wasn't either too bad um yeah so um big deal I'm not trying to
[1682.56 → 1690.80] be a hater but uh i I'm not about to be too interested in going back to 1080p that's that's
[1690.80 → 1697.12] one thing for me, i I do know for a fact there will definitely be CSGO people that'll be all over this
[1697.12 → 1705.20] 100 percent for sure the thing about it the thing about it is that 30 hertz is uh a lot you know 30
[1705.20 → 1711.76] times per second 30 hertz at that level when you go when you go from 60 hertz to 90 hertz you are
[1711.76 → 1718.72] talking about a difference in like what does that work out to about five milliseconds potentially
[1718.72 → 1725.12] you could get information five milliseconds earlier I mean that's the difference for a lot of people
[1725.12 → 1731.60] between gaming on a local area network and on like an internet connected server this is a significant
[1731.60 → 1737.92] difference oh yeah when you go from one moment please let me bring up my calculator here okay so
[1737.92 → 1750.48] when you go from uh 390 to or from 360 to 390 it is an eight percent improvement which by the time you're at
[1750.48 → 1761.20] 360 so hold on one moment please let's take one second divided by 360 so that is about uh 2.7 milliseconds
[1762.00 → 1769.76] per frame i think I'm doing the math right here and then so hold on times 0.92 because we've
[1769.76 → 1780.00] got it okay so it's 2.55 milliseconds per frame so we're talking about literally a fraction of a millisecond
[1780.48 → 1792.32] of difference now, now less latency definitely better but I would be very surprised and I'm not
[1792.32 → 1797.20] yeah he's not saying it's worse no it's not you're getting into pretty slim margins this isn't a monitor
[1797.20 → 1804.24] for most people yes um like I pointed out like the counterstrike fanatics are probably going
[1804.24 → 1811.04] to go for it and I hope they love it but yeah this is not this is not like if you're like yeah I'm
[1811.04 → 1817.92] having a lot of fun uh trying to get to gold and Apex Legends silver has been really entertaining like
[1817.92 → 1823.36] it probably doesn't matter don't worry about it too much I mean I have a hard time imagining who this
[1823.36 → 1828.80] would matter for but I'm never gonna you know I'm never going to hate on like faster computers for the
[1828.80 → 1833.44] sake of faster computers yeah you know what I mean you know actually yeah push the limit right it
[1833.44 → 1840.00] didn't even occur to me to uh to look into what refresh rate the new m1 max uh IMAX are running at
[1840.72 → 1845.76] I would love to see apple just kind of put pressure on the rest of the industry to move to high refresh
[1845.76 → 1851.04] rate displays and everything they did it on the iPad Pro and I was like oh yeah heck yeah man it's
[1851.04 → 1857.60] happening its happening, and then they just didn't kind of dropped it yeah they just completely
[1857.60 → 1864.72] dropped it iPhone mac everything they're like yeah that was pretty cool we got a lot of really
[1864.72 → 1868.08] great feedback for this hyper responsiveness of this display
[1870.48 → 1876.00] put that in my back pocket think about it consider it one day we need some good sentiment
[1876.00 → 1882.80] we'll leave it for now a few years from now we'll, we'll talk about it yeah um yeah Yousef says we're
[1882.80 → 1891.52] at diminishing returns at 360 hertz oh 100 I mean quite notably yeah 360 hertz does feel significantly
[1891.52 → 1898.08] smoother I would say I would say that's where I expect to see the biggest difference going forward
[1898.08 → 1902.88] not in terms of responsiveness anymore but in terms of animation smoothness because you got to remember
[1902.88 → 1911.60] your eyes don't see in frames per second that that question of how many fps does the eye see
[1911.60 → 1918.80] it's its it's not correct the way the eye sees is not like that the the pink the pink goo that
[1918.80 → 1928.16] lives behind them doesn't process in in in frames it's it actually can do so much it can the fact that we can
[1928.16 → 1935.60] display content in frames per second and see it as smooth is because of the magic goo so the way that
[1935.60 → 1942.56] we see is actually dependent on what we're looking at for example we are far more sensitive to motion
[1942.56 → 1947.92] for example in our peripheral vision compared to things that are stationary that's not something that
[1947.92 → 1956.56] you can express as frames per second, so my expectation is that especially as we move to OLED displays and as
[1956.56 → 1962.96] refresh rates get to the 500 hertz or 1000 hertz range is we're going to see a difference in our
[1962.96 → 1970.56] ability to track an opponent or track a target based on the clarity of the image and the smoothness of the
[1970.56 → 1978.40] animation as opposed to it actually being about getting a competitive edge by seeing your opponent
[1978.40 → 1980.48] or seeing the information before your opponent does
[1980.48 → 1986.64] um we should probably talk about our sponsors at some point here
[1990.48 → 1995.76] starting with what sorry one just before you go into it that monitor that you had at the office when
[1995.76 → 2005.36] we were doing my 360 360 yeah, so mine is 144 yeah and that's okay so that's a big jump, but that was
[2005.36 → 2012.56] very noticeable yes so yeah I don't know very noticeable it made you kind of want one like
[2012.56 → 2020.40] that didn't it is did but I also don't want a game at 10 ap so maybe in the future sometime yep we need
[2020.40 → 2026.56] we need one more DisplayPort refresh, and then we'll be able to do really high refresh rate 1440p displays
[2026.56 → 2035.12] and that will be sick that'll be killer yeah all right word pass thanks to word pass for sponsoring

[2094.96 → 2101.20] you have to stop carrying around pointless items like hotel room keys you know yeah you're muted by the
[2101.20 → 2107.36] way old hotel room keys nobody has old hotel room keys anymore because nobody travels but I mean I was gonna
[2107.36 → 2111.20] say how long did it take you into the pandemic to actually be rid of all of those
[2111.20 → 2120.56] I always forget to return them always because so most hotels just have like zero interaction
[2120.56 → 2126.00] checkout now right yeah like i remember travelling somewhere with someone, and we were on our
[2126.00 → 2130.88] way down to the lobby, and they're like they like went to line up at the desk and I was like what are
[2130.88 → 2137.04] you doing like oh I'm checking out like nobody checks out what year is it you just leave and then
[2137.04 → 2142.48] they go to clean the room, and you're not there, and they don't bill you for if it's fine you just
[2142.48 → 2148.24] I always wondered why you have to check out I mean I guess if you need to you know settle a room
[2148.24 → 2152.96] service tab or something like that but now they have your credit card they have your credit card
[2153.52 → 2159.36] and that's been true for 10 years like i yeah anyway ridge wallet helps you carry less they use two metal
[2159.36 → 2163.92] plates that are bound by a strong elastic band to keep your cards tightly together but still accessible
[2163.92 → 2168.00] they're RFID blocking they've got a lifetime guarantee, and they're available in aluminum
[2168.00 → 2173.76] carbon fibre and titanium and ridge doesn't sell just wallets they have battery banks bags smartphone
[2173.76 → 2181.76] covers and more, and you can use code when to save 10 at ridge.com slash when finally the show is brought
[2181.76 → 2190.88] to you by the MSI Meg 27 4qrf-qd MSI thank you for sponsoring the show holy crap fix your product naming
[2190.88 → 2202.96] um that the the the mag 274 RFID is a 27-inch monitor okay so that's where the 27 comes in mag is
[2202.96 → 2211.44] like MSI something gaming I think so you got 27 for 27 inch okay, and then it's 2560 by 1440 so that's
[2211.44 → 2221.28] probably where the CD at the end comes in because that's like quad HD okay it runs at 165 hertz
[2221.28 → 2228.64] with one millisecond grade degree response times I don't know where that works into um 274 QRF but
[2228.64 → 2233.92] that's okay it's got quantum dot oh that's probably that's probably the CD at the end so the q in the
[2233.92 → 2241.12] beginning part is probably for quad HD resolution uh okay it's g sync compatible there's no g in the
[2241.12 → 2247.84] product name, but that's okay and is it though it's IPS it's IPS height adjustable arm okay in all
[2247.84 → 2254.56] seriousness very high performance monitor great colours great pixel response times nice fast refresh
[2254.56 → 2262.24] rate 165 hertz go check it out and uh we're going to have a link down below okay leg.GG MSI Meg so you
[2262.24 → 2270.64] don't have to remember that it's called the mag 274 QRF dash CD oh what just happened oops sorry, sorry
[2270.64 → 2275.68] about that all right why don't we jump into our next big topic for the day should we get political
[2275.68 → 2282.00] again Luke do you want to get yeah I was trying to prep for it let's talk about what happened at base
[2282.00 → 2288.72] camp first of all what is base camp uh they make a few different things I think probably most notably
[2288.72 → 2295.60] as of late would be hey the email thing yeah um and that would be because of the controversy
[2295.60 → 2300.88] that they had with I believe it was specifically apple, but it was like the cut that uh mobile
[2300.88 → 2305.04] platforms are taking so you've probably heard of them we've talked about them on the Sancho before
[2305.04 → 2309.60] because of their hey email app, but they have also done other things it's not just that
[2311.68 → 2318.16] okay and uh what's going on at base camp right now okay, so there was this has been interesting to
[2318.16 → 2323.04] track because the amount of sub tweeting that has gone on around this has been immense and what i
[2323.04 → 2329.60] mean by that is people just like tweeting angrily but not explaining why um I've noticed over the last
[2329.60 → 2335.76] few days that my feed I follow a lot of developers and stuff my feed has exploded, and it actually took
[2335.76 → 2342.24] me a while to get to the bottom of what was going on uh so on Monday base camp CEO published a blog
[2342.24 → 2348.24] post where he outlined a bunch of changes in the company and by a bunch I genuinely mean like a lot
[2348.88 → 2353.12] they don't even seem to be all like related like that's kind of the bizarre thing about this to me
[2354.80 → 2358.88] well it's one of the bizarre things carry on they're they're kind of all over the place um and
[2358.88 → 2365.36] he actually defines it as a version change um so like a version change of the company like this
[2365.36 → 2373.76] is a big sweeping massive change um it is he breaks it down into a variety of sections so I'm actually
[2373.76 → 2377.92] going to skip the first one because that's the one that it seems like most people have problems with
[2377.92 → 2383.44] and I'm going to go to the more simple ones first um so no forgetting what we do here he says we make
[2383.44 → 2388.40] project management team communication and email software we are not a social impact company blah blah
[2389.04 → 2394.32] that bothered some people for sure um no more 360 reviews that's talking about like essentially they're
[2394.32 → 2400.08] not going to do peer feedback reviews they're going to do direct managerial reviews uh no more lingering
[2400.08 → 2409.44] or dwelling on past decisions which is a really fun company rule good luck with that one what does that
[2409.44 → 2416.16] even mean we've become a bit too precious with decision-making over the last few years either by
[2416.16 → 2423.28] wallowing in indecisiveness worrying ourselves into overthinking things yeah okay uh it's for sure it's a
[2423.28 → 2428.96] it's a problem you don't want to get stuck like scared of making decisions because of past problems
[2428.96 → 2436.24] but like wow a bit of an interesting company rule to not linger on uh past decisions no more committees
[2438.16 → 2444.64] for nearly all of our 21-year existence we were proudly committee free no big working groups making
[2444.64 → 2450.40] big decisions or blah blah essentially no big committees no more paternalistic benefits and this took me a
[2450.40 → 2457.60] a second I literally had to google this um essentially they used to have a fund they offered a
[2457.60 → 2464.00] fitness benefit a wellness allowance a farmer's market share continuing education allowances like
[2464.00 → 2468.64] all this other kind of stuff, and they're cutting they're cutting that off they are introducing a 10
[2469.36 → 2476.88] profit sharing plan um but they like they don't before it was like we want to help you spend in
[2476.88 → 2483.68] these ways, and they're canning that um they're just doing the 10 profit sharing plan uh now here's the
[2483.68 → 2489.12] big one this is the one that seems to have lit most of the fires there's a few there are quite a few things
[2489.12 → 2493.28] in here that people are going to get pretty aggravated about for sure yeah, but this one seems to be the
[2493.28 → 2500.48] bonfire out of all the okay can you relax you calm down um this one seems to be the bonfire out of all the
[2500.48 → 2509.52] other small fires uh no more societal and political discussions on our company base camp account today's
[2509.52 → 2514.24] social and political waters are especially choppy sensitivities are at 11 and every discussion
[2514.24 → 2520.56] remotely related politics uh advocacy or society at large uh quickly spins away from pleasant
[2522.48 → 2529.12] yeah um, so these were all pretty impactful to a lot of employees at base camp because a lot of these
[2529.12 → 2535.28] things seem to have this is all what I've gleaned from just trying to read people's uh twitter posts
[2535.28 → 2540.64] and whatnot about it a lot of these things seem to have defined people's experiences at base camp
[2540.64 → 2543.76] it's a big part of the reason why they worked there yeah and now there have been
[2545.12 → 2551.44] sweeping changes yeah yeah yeah um, so there was something pretty interesting that was done I don't know
[2551.44 → 2557.12] if this was expected maybe it was maybe it wasn't uh the CEO offered a generous severance for those
[2557.12 → 2566.08] that didn't agree with him um which I mean sure why not but a third of the company just straight up
[2566.08 → 2574.32] quit after he did that um again maybe that was kind of the goal maybe it was maybe it wasn't I don't know
[2574.88 → 2583.20] um yeah I mean here's a really challenging thing is how do you draw the line between what's political
[2583.20 → 2587.68] and what's not I mean i saw an interesting billboard the other day I was I happened to be
[2587.68 → 2595.20] on the phone with my wife while I was driving in to play badminton and on speaker of course um so I was
[2595.20 → 2600.24] just chatting with her and I saw this billboard that was like a hashtag stop Asian hate billboard
[2600.24 → 2604.32] and like I'm talking to her about this, and we're just speaking very candidly I'm like
[2605.68 → 2612.16] you know obviously I agree with the sentiment but what are the odds that a billboard you know is going
[2612.16 → 2622.80] to take some racist jackass and oh now I can make them reflect and go oh you know what wow maybe skin
[2622.80 → 2628.72] colour is just a colour and not actually like meaningful, and we might as well divide people by
[2629.28 → 2637.68] how tall they are, or you know the diameter of their nostrils or any other number of like
[2637.68 → 2645.04] inane ways to divide people into groups like we could just as easily do it by hair colour and
[2645.04 → 2651.36] you know whatever like it's going to make it's going to make them you just oh wow it's if only I had
[2651.36 → 2656.32] seen that billboard earlier in my life it would have it would have changed the way that I feel
[2656.32 → 2662.00] it's so different um and anyway the other part of the billboard so it had the hashtag on it and
[2662.00 → 2669.12] than it also just said um you know uh racism is not an opinion, and it's like yeah that's that's true
[2669.12 → 2675.12] that's that's a conversation that for whatever reason we have to have now I guess is that like
[2675.12 → 2682.40] sort of being an is that's that's not an opinion that's just like being a jerk, and you know yes your
[2682.40 → 2687.52] your you know free speech or whatever in the west it definitely allows you to say a lot of things
[2687.52 → 2692.16] that you can say, but it doesn't mean that there are no consequences for them, it just means that the
[2692.16 → 2696.80] government can't lock you up for speaking against the government that's like actually what that means
[2696.80 → 2706.72] um so being a jerk is like still bad and has always been bad um but uh coming back to the base camp
[2706.72 → 2715.20] conversation that's where I think that um this is I don't know this is it's complicated, but it's also not
[2715.20 → 2722.40] that complicated where the justification for this seems to be that oh it's very difficult to
[2722.40 → 2728.96] draw these lines between what's political and what's not political but to me like being a jerk or
[2728.96 → 2737.44] being intolerant of others is not political that's just like being a jerk um and the point which i
[2737.44 → 2743.84] think might have gotten lost in the weeds somewhere but the point not by us to be clear um I just think
[2743.84 → 2749.68] in general um the point the CEO's reasoning was that discussion of political topics was a major
[2749.68 → 2758.24] distraction and people to focus on their work more and that may be a fair point like if you've got you
[2758.24 → 2766.32] know literally you have a whole group of people that are dedicated to being the committee on you
[2766.32 → 2775.60] know whatever conversation that has quite frankly absolutely nothing to do with work um you
[2775.60 → 2781.92] know like a short people's you know equal rights committee or something like that I picked
[2781.92 → 2787.28] that not because I think short people particularly need better rights by the way they are actually
[2787.28 → 2792.32] disadvantaged group just saying um i I picked that because it's an easy one for me to pick on because
[2792.32 → 2797.12] I am below average height anyway the point is maybe there's this committee and all the people
[2797.12 → 2804.00] that are on this committee spend like 30 of their time like doing committee things that have absolutely
[2804.00 → 2809.44] nothing to do with improving their apps and services i I don't know maybe it really was a significant
[2809.44 → 2815.76] problem and maybe the management of the company although quite a few high level people did leave
[2815.76 → 2823.60] maybe maybe maybe the management of the company sees this third of them leaving as a boon I don't I don't
[2823.60 → 2831.36] know but to me the line between what's political not to pull it and what is not political isn't really
[2832.16 → 2841.36] that that complicated, but we also have a pretty homogeneous culture at Linus media group for the most part and
[2841.36 → 2847.76] when I say homogeneous culture I don't necessarily mean things like skin colour I mean that we don't
[2847.76 → 2854.64] have debates in the hallways about um you know whether certain groups of people should be allowed to
[2855.36 → 2863.60] you know go there or whatever we i I mean obviously as CEO I don't necessarily see everyone's true colours
[2863.60 → 2874.16] but certainly nobody has had the coho coho coho coho to um be outwardly uh you know discriminatory
[2874.16 → 2882.24] uh when I'm present so i I don't know it just hasn't been a problem it hasn't served that there isn't a lot of
[2882.24 → 2891.76] debate necessarily there i and I have no idea what goes on at that company um but i I would say just
[2891.76 → 2899.44] like reading this blog this changes at base camp blog it's weird it's really weird like even
[2899.44 → 2905.60] including like the no more lingering or dwelling on past decisions like I think there are other ways if
[2905.60 → 2910.72] this is the type of stuff you're trying to get across if you're like wow we're really all over the
[2910.72 → 2915.76] place and this has become like a social camp more than a workspace and like all this other kind of stuff
[2915.76 → 2922.72] I think you can communicate those types of things and try to drive that change in way different ways
[2922.72 → 2929.20] than this I think this was a really horrible way of doing it um again maybe he wanted people to leave
[2930.16 → 2937.12] it's possible, but the thing is like I don't know I mean saying it like that it's not like I'm some kind of
[2937.12 → 2945.20] management guru or human resources expert or anything like that but framing something negatively is almost
[2945.76 → 2951.04] never the way to get people on your side what you need to say is we need to improve our decisiveness
[2951.04 → 2956.56] you know that's your you know your manager speak or whatever you can't say we need to stop questioning
[2956.56 → 2963.68] my you know freaking decisions that that's just that's always going to rub people the wrong way
[2963.68 → 2971.04] no matter how long your history is Luke no, no Luke stop we're not going to question what I just said
[2971.04 → 2976.88] there's no debate Linus come on uh there was something you said a long time ago which
[2976.88 → 2982.40] kind of goes in line with number four um you brought up I don't remember exactly how you said
[2982.40 → 2987.12] it so I'm going to misquote the heck out of you, but it was something along the lines of like if we make
[2987.12 → 2992.32] if we make a decision like if we're in a room with a group of people, and we need to make a decision on
[2992.32 → 2998.08] how we're going to do something yeah you're on board like this is a team you can make
[2998.08 → 3003.04] your arguments, but ultimately we need to come up with the best possible solution as a team and run
[3003.04 → 3010.48] with it and if it doesn't really work out pointing back and be like well I didn't like is useless and
[3010.48 → 3015.52] you just need to try to like drive and improve it in the future and i you said it much better than that
[3015.52 → 3022.16] but like it was essentially like you need to be a part of the team and not just like complaining
[3022.72 → 3027.28] yeah don't be a complaint pants don't present a problem unless you have a solution yeah complaining
[3027.28 → 3032.24] all the time not posting solutions like blah blah blah now it's not benefiting things it doesn't make
[3032.24 → 3037.28] you feel like privacy in float plane chat they're saying the past decisions seem to be kind of a code
[3037.28 → 3046.08] word for um ignoring this um racially insensitive list of funny names for their customers that they
[3046.08 → 3053.60] used to have or something like that so it may be that basically they just wanted to
[3054.80 → 3060.88] get rid of people that were upset about certain aspects of their company's history and a pattern
[3060.88 → 3066.40] of uh insensitive behaviour yeah see like I don't I don't know those types of details about this kind of
[3066.40 → 3073.92] stuff um I think it's like at the end of the day you cannot treat people like human resources
[3075.04 → 3082.16] and when I say I use the even just the term human resources how disgusting is that right you're you're
[3082.16 → 3089.20] basically resources we use the word resources to describe things like you know things like iron ore in
[3089.20 → 3096.24] the side of a mountain inanimate object um and the only reason I use that term is because in the interest of
[3096.24 → 3102.72] clear communication with other human beings I use the universally understood terms to describe
[3102.72 → 3109.52] things instead of trying to come up with my own you know snowflake names for things but i I do find it
[3110.24 → 3117.92] pretty disrespectful honestly to refer to people as human resources and I think that a successful company
[3117.92 → 3125.04] that has this attitude that people are sort of easily replaceable and disposable um
[3126.72 → 3131.76] I think it's not I don't think it's good for anyone yeah I don't think it feels good for the employees i
[3131.76 → 3140.00] don't think it feels good for um owners i i think if an owner feels like their employees are like
[3140.00 → 3145.92] easy replaceable like cartridges basically then they're probably pretty detached from the company at that point
[3145.92 → 3156.08] right um people are suggesting we can make hr human relations I mean that really sounds
[3156.08 → 3162.24] like that sounds like some kind of like sex orgy cult or something I was going to say that sounds like
[3162.24 → 3168.64] a little too intimate hey you guys want you guys want to go to club human relations on Saturday night
[3168.64 → 3174.64] I don't know you guys want to yeah I don't know I was going to try to make a joke about keep talking and
[3174.64 → 3178.16] nobody explodes because I want to have a float plane game night where we play that soon but
[3178.80 → 3187.44] um I couldn't, I couldn't make it work oh boy anyway um why don't we uh why don't we go ahead and talk
[3187.44 → 3195.04] about another topic here about something I guess uh if you're looking to hire developers especially
[3195.04 → 3203.04] mobile ones a bunch of them just entered the market so good luck I know right seriously though like a lot
[3203.04 → 3208.24] I there 's's a lot of twitter posts about like hey so I'm going to like go vacation for two weeks but
[3208.24 → 3214.64] then I'm looking for a job there's its there's a lot of them so yeah scoop them up all right so much
[3214.64 → 3221.44] Samsung very wow plus 3050 ti Samsung's April unpacked event was this week they showed off some new
[3221.44 → 3227.36] laptops freaking amazing looking OLED panels they're based off the same tech as the screen in the uh sorry
[3227.36 → 3233.36] they are apparently based off the same tech as the screen in the s21 ultra but in practice it's pretty
[3233.84 → 3239.84] different uh we looked at the 15-inch galaxy book on short circuit it looks pretty freaking awesome
[3239.84 → 3245.52] although the chassis stiffness was a bit of a letdown hopefully on the 13 inch 360 model it's a bit better
[3245.52 → 3253.36] but check this out this is a is a really different looking um this is a is a really different looking
[3253.36 → 3259.12] it's a sub pixel arrangement so you're looking at the pixel 5 right now it's very similar on the s21 ultra
[3259.68 → 3267.52] and then right here you're looking at the Samsung Galaxy book pro, so there's they say it's like oh
[3267.52 → 3278.88] based on the s21 ultra, but it looks like very, very different so we're used to seeing green pixels outnumber
[3278.88 → 3285.36] the other ones by two to one almost I think if I recall correctly it's like half green and then 25
[3285.36 → 3294.48] percent each of the others if I recall correct tomorrow um but instead what we're looking no
[3294.48 → 3300.72] actually hold on I'm having a look at the uh the matrix here everyone yeah no I think that
[3300.72 → 3308.64] that is actually right yes, but this is way heavier on blue sub pixels but then the green and red
[3308.64 → 3315.52] ones look significantly brighter this is definitely going to require some more uh investigation
[3316.40 → 3322.24] in practice apparently it looks like perfect though uh they know it looks very odd in this
[3322.24 → 3328.72] sample though yeah I haven't seen one like that before uh they also announced their galaxy odyssey
[3328.72 → 3335.52] gaming laptop that features NVIDIA's until now unannounced 3050 ti we don't have a lot of info about it
[3335.52 → 3339.92] because they haven't actually officially announced that GPU, but the leaks suggest it will have four
[3339.92 → 3345.28] gigs of memory uh given that the laptops come with 135 watt charger don't expect too much in terms of
[3345.28 → 3350.48] performance, but you could expect decent battery life, and they have 11th gen intel CPUs which uh might
[3350.48 → 3356.48] be good but are probably just fine and that's about it there actually kind of wasn't really that much
[3356.48 → 3361.76] but hey apple's next m series so chas apparently entered mass production according to Nikki Asia sources
[3361.76 → 3366.32] the next generation of Apple Silicon processors have entered mass production this month
[3366.32 → 3372.80] and it is tentatively being referred to as m2 that surprises me I would have thought it would be like
[3372.80 → 3378.80] like m1 like plus or something like gen 1 but like better so maybe we'll go from m1 and
[3378.80 → 3384.88] then they usually start doing that later on m10 and m20 like i i I don't know
[3384.88 → 3397.04] uh so with there a series SOCS they have it's been a and then the number to indicate the generation
[3397.04 → 3403.84] but what we're expecting is that m2 is going to be like a higher performance part intended for a
[3403.84 → 3410.56] different tier of system it's on TSMC's five nanometre process but beyond the actual manufacturing in a rough
[3410.56 → 3415.52] timeline we don't know much, and it hasn't been leaked, so there's speculation about it being 12
[3415.52 → 3421.44] cores eight high performance for low power or 16 cores 12 high performance and four low power along
[3421.44 → 3427.20] with 16 GPU cores, but it's just speculation shipments could begin as early as July to be used in new
[3427.20 → 3432.48] macBooks, but the chip will also see use in other products down the line like the m1 with how good the
[3432.48 → 3441.28] m1 is um so yeah i I am very interested to see what their second kick at the can looks like it's
[3441.28 → 3447.12] good it's exciting finally do you want to talk us through the uh sorry game stuttering and blame
[3447.12 → 3453.04] windows windows Windows users have seen stuttering flickering and text rendering issues when playing
[3453.04 → 3460.16] certain games due to a recent Windows update oh boy the fix was applied server-side last weekend
[3460.16 → 3466.72] requiring no action from users um just so you guys know the problem as well as outright crashes were
[3466.72 → 3477.04] linked to the kb-5001-330 update and the previous kb-5842 update uh with even an NVIDIA forum admin
[3477.04 → 3483.52] coming forward to recommend that folks try removing these updates to fix the bugs which is uh kind of
[3483.52 → 3490.08] big yikes but um you know you have to do what you have to do to get those smooth frames yep uh the 840
[3490.08 → 3495.84] update was an optional update aimed at fixing performance and printing issues lol the fact
[3496.40 → 3502.96] we're still fixing printers yeah the fact that that isn't just completely solved in 2021 is bonkers to
[3502.96 → 3509.20] me, but you know printers still need fixing I guess for a disruptor okay Luke there's room for a disruptive
[3509.20 → 3517.68] printer manufacturer but like seriously instantly I would buy it just works, and the refills are cheap
[3517.68 → 3526.08] printer I'm in I'm down yeah yeah if someone can make that happen i yeah the issue is probably just
[3526.08 → 3531.44] that like hp and whoever just own every related patent, and it would be basically impossible to
[3531.44 → 3536.64] build a printer that's what I suspect is actually going on here I have a total ignorance though
[3536.64 → 3543.60] ignorance you could get a could get around windows by like using email to like to receive the
[3543.60 → 3547.84] printing jobs and like all this other kind of stuff just like completely avoid the old ways but
[3547.84 → 3553.84] remember a lot of people are printing from Microsoft applications I don't think the I don't think the
[3553.84 → 3559.92] office team would throw that kind of shade at the windows team they're like hey so we noticed your
[3559.92 → 3566.72] print stack is terrible um you can do custom printing sources so like you could see this part i
[3566.72 → 3572.88] think seems to work fine uh, but you know how you can do like cute PDF where you print to software yeah
[3573.52 → 3579.52] you could print to software that emails it I just mean that the word team is not about to make that the
[3579.52 → 3588.16] default behaviour oh no yeah I don't know I'm just trying to find weird ways of avoiding ways that stuff
[3588.16 → 3596.32] yeah i just it's just it's its amazed me since I've been into computers how screwed printers have been
[3596.32 → 3600.48] you know so it's just like I don't know just abandon everything we've done this whole time and
[3600.48 → 3607.04] trying to find a different way because it's clearly not working but anyway um on the Microsoft support
[3607.04 → 3612.00] page Microsoft says that a small subset of users has reported lower than expected performance
[3613.28 → 3620.40] etc however this small subset seems to be an approximate 20 of users which is pretty rough that
[3620.40 → 3625.76] being said uh it's more likely that users are going to come out upset than users are going to come out
[3625.76 → 3631.28] completely okay with it yeah, and they don't roll they don't roll these updates worldwide instantly
[3631.28 → 3638.40] either and once they start noticing problems it's typical that they uh slow the roll-out at least yeah
[3640.00 → 3649.52] and I think the last uh the last one today is the epic versus apple um court hearings start on Monday
[3650.40 → 3654.64] it's going to be interesting we've been talking about this very consistently and for a long time and now
[3654.64 → 3660.96] we're going to see some more movement on if it's just it's so if there's so much interesting
[3660.96 → 3668.72] stuff coming out because of this some of it even about apple um so back uh back in 2013 uh senior vice
[3668.72 → 3673.44] president of internet software and services Eddie q apparently wanted to bring iMessage to android
[3673.44 → 3678.08] uh championing the cause so that they wouldn't lose out to google in mobile in the mobile messaging
[3678.08 → 3684.08] space considering how they had already dominated in mail video etc um in response um
[3687.60 → 3692.64] the uh senior VP of software engineering politely expressed the difficulty apple would have convincing
[3692.64 → 3697.60] users on the android side to switch to iMessage we'd need more than a marginally better app
[3698.96 → 3703.60] Craig also expressed a concern that it would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families
[3703.60 → 3711.04] giving their kids android phones so here's something I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around
[3712.40 → 3717.92] iMessage gets put on this pedestal as like the killer app a killer app for iPhone
[3720.72 → 3728.56] why yeah I don't know i I saw this like series of tweets from someone saying that like denying iMessage to
[3728.56 → 3736.24] people that aren't on iPhone is like denying people like basic human resources um and by that I don't
[3736.24 → 3742.24] mean that that reference yeah that references earlier in the show but I meant like food and water and
[3742.24 → 3748.16] housing and like stuff like that, and it's just like what are you even possibly talking about yeah I was
[3748.16 → 3756.16] uh yeah Ivan and i uh were talking about this on the way home from work the other day um, and she's just like
[3756.16 → 3763.84] she's like what well I can't see how I can't see how not having I message would interfere with anyone's
[3763.84 → 3771.84] social life or something like that and I'm like right because you my dear would never have anyone in
[3771.84 → 3778.08] your life for any extended period of time who actually made decisions based on what kind of phone
[3778.08 → 3787.20] someone else had that doesn't mean those people are not out there i I don't think I don't think
[3787.20 → 3792.00] I'm friends with anyone who would do that I don't think well you wouldn't be able to because you're
[3792.00 → 3798.80] some kind of disgusting android pleb yeah like um and maybe that's why I've I've heard of it being a
[3798.80 → 3805.12] thing like I've heard of the like uh like why are your text bubbles this different colour I judge you
[3805.12 → 3810.24] because I'm a douchebag I've heard of that stuff but I've never experienced anything like that in
[3810.24 → 3816.88] my the dream star says because it's there by default you don't need your friends to install a third party
[3816.88 → 3826.48] app it's text messaging its text messaging everything and also because you're I think even
[3826.48 → 3833.12] I think even the stupid watch that I reviewed had it by default is your friend is your friend a moron
[3833.12 → 3840.40] they don't know how to install an app why do they even have a smartphone it's unnecessary to get a flip
[3840.40 → 3848.96] phone yeah what are you talking about yeah the uh what was that thing called Neptune pine I'm pretty
[3848.96 → 3854.48] sure the Neptune pine had text messaging by default this is not like this is not an innovative thing
[3854.48 → 3859.68] okay dark slayer asks do I message do something special all right it has end-to-end encryption
[3859.68 → 3866.56] not the best on the market, but it is end-to-end encrypted it has very robust support for media
[3866.56 → 3873.52] sharing so very high quality uh picture sharing low compression that's a good thing you can do your
[3873.52 → 3878.56] anemosis or whatever it has excellent support for things with stickers and all that kind of
[3878.56 → 3885.84] reaction crap excellent support for group messages all things that lots of other apps I guarantee you i
[3885.84 → 3890.16] could come up with apps most of you have never even heard of that have excellent support for all
[3890.16 → 3896.16] those things line for example huge in Taiwan basically irrelevant for much of the rest of the
[3896.16 → 3902.64] world it's awesome it's got lots of great features other than china which it's huge there as far as my
[3902.64 → 3908.40] understanding yeah I don't think so I thought it's all WeChat in China oh maybe you're right yeah okay
[3909.52 → 3914.16] we chat's a steaming pile of garbage if they didn't have like a government-enforced
[3914.16 → 3919.68] basically monopoly like there's so many features there's so many um things that you do through
[3919.68 → 3924.56] your WeChat account like being able to you know pay for things and stuff like that like if it wasn't
[3924.56 → 3929.44] for that i I can't imagine them having the kind of market show that they do but yeah that's a whole
[3929.44 → 3935.12] that's a whole separate conversation line is apparently big in Japan as well uh according to uh
[3935.12 → 3943.52] according to twitch chat um but yeah line sweet yeah fresh prints of whatever this is says
[3943.52 → 3952.00] says I message is godly nope it's just a messaging app, and it's actually the worst messaging app because
[3952.00 → 3956.48] it's not cross-platform that makes it literally the worst messaging app
[3958.88 → 3964.48] any messaging app that is not cross-platform is like why is it in my life exactly I genuinely like
[3964.48 → 3969.84] I feel like I need to sit down and like to have a coffee with someone who genuinely thinks this stuff
[3969.84 → 3974.96] just so I can like really get into their head so I can understand it because i I have been whiffed
[3974.96 → 3979.92] this whole time like i just I genuinely have never understood it has only seemed like a status
[3981.12 → 3987.04] okay that's it right there the reason that you don't have a coffee with this person and can't
[3987.04 → 3992.16] get into their head is because you live in a completely different world Luke because remember
[3992.16 → 3997.68] these the same kind of people that would decide like I remember talking about this I think it was on
[3997.68 → 4002.24] tech linked we might have talked about it on wan show but your odds of being swiped whatever the
[4002.24 → 4008.32] correct way is on tinder were something like 60 plus percent higher if you had an iPhone in your
[4008.32 → 4014.24] profile picture versus having an android phone they like did a study on this um and the reason
[4014.96 → 4022.56] the reason for it is that you as an android pleb who doesn't give any cares about it um don't
[4022.56 → 4027.28] understand that there's a whole other group of people out there none of whom you interact with because
[4027.68 → 4033.60] they wouldn't be caught dead talking to you that really are that superficial that will actually
[4033.60 → 4040.08] you know notice that I am wearing Costco jeans and not ask me for directions and instead ask someone
[4040.08 → 4045.28] else for directions who's wearing jeans from I don't know a store that things cost more money or
[4045.28 → 4052.32] something um so you have to understand that the blue bubble means a lot more than just you have an
[4052.32 → 4058.32] iPhone and support for an emojis none of that actually matters which is why I message zealots
[4059.20 → 4066.72] can never actually explain without sounding like complete why they care about I message
[4066.72 → 4073.20] it's because the real reason is that they're a pompous douchebag not because there's any other
[4073.20 → 4079.84] actual reason yeah and that that's what it's felt like but like people keep on trying to make arguments
[4079.84 → 4084.96] and none of them really make sense so I keep on being like right doesn't yeah because they
[4084.96 → 4091.68] they whether they know it or not the actual reason is that they're elitist douche nozzles not
[4091.68 → 4097.12] realizing that if I'm rocking a galaxy fold or whatever my phone actually costs twice as much
[4097.12 → 4102.32] as theirs, and it has absolutely nothing to do with being some kind of pleb like I remember I tweeted
[4102.32 → 4108.88] about this a little while ago like you can get a blue bubble for like 75 dollars one bay having an iPhone
[4108.88 → 4115.04] doesn't mean anything except that it means that it was important enough to you to have an iPhone
[4115.04 → 4122.40] that you are that kind of shallow that's all it means that's that would be hilarious i I wouldn't
[4122.40 → 4128.16] even be surprised if there is someone out there who like mainlines an android device oh it's a thing
[4128.16 → 4133.52] but no before you even finish it's a thing you route it through your iPhone to send to your iMessage peeps
[4133.52 → 4138.72] and you just have an iPhone sitting plugged into a wall it's totally a thing I forget how to do it
[4138.72 → 4142.32] but we talked about it when we were doing like Hackintosh or something like there's a whole
[4142.88 → 4148.80] there's its a whole thing that you can do uh mad perf sex says Linus is judging our personal
[4148.80 → 4155.04] preferences no I'm judging other people's personal preferences being an iMessage elitist means
[4155.04 → 4161.36] you are an and that's not a personal preference that's a bad attitude it's that simple I don't care if
[4161.36 → 4166.72] you have an iPhone that's the difference if you care that someone else doesn't then you're an and
[4166.72 → 4171.52] that's not an opinion that's just you being judgmental and I'm allowed to judge you for being
[4171.52 → 4176.64] judgmental you don't just get to play the're being judgmental card and I should accept your
[4176.64 → 4182.32] judgmentally or whatever the word is for that that's not how it works you know it's like when
[4182.32 → 4186.88] someone walks up and kicks your dog, and you punch them in the face you are not the aggressor they are
[4186.88 → 4195.68] they had it coming yeah yeah um i i I also love how the example of how to fix it is like the most
[4195.68 → 4202.00] stereotypically over the top working around the solution way too hard android type of thing
[4202.80 → 4208.08] like rerouting your messages through this device that you just have planted there all like oh my
[4208.08 → 4215.36] goodness well whatever I don't make the rules man what I do make the rules about is when we go through
[4215.36 → 4220.40] and read some super chats because it's pretty much the end of the show uh Robert mail says hybrid
[4220.40 → 4227.36] core windows might be a mess hopefully yeah hopefully the windows scheduler team can pull some experience
[4227.36 → 4232.08] from the windows arm team otherwise the performance degradations will be zen one all over again but
[4232.08 → 4239.12] probably worse you're probably right but this time because intel will have done it first and because
[4239.12 → 4245.28] AMD is a bigger player we might see more optimization before the release of the product instead of
[4245.28 → 4253.84] after the release of the product um so we can hope for the best um tropical I love this
[4253.84 → 4262.24] is a bit of an inside joke for cross code fans but uh the message is hi Leah I love it thanks you
[4262.88 → 4267.28] um chapters says hey guys do you think people should have some kind of protection when it comes to digital
[4267.28 → 4273.04] downloads of games um not that it would ever happen but what if steam went bust I'd lose over 200 games
[4273.04 → 4279.52] doesn't steam have a provision for that in their user license agreement no idea I'm actually not
[4279.52 → 4283.76] sure if they do but uh yeah that is the kind of thing that should probably legislate that should
[4283.76 → 4291.60] probably be legislated if a platform is going to go away um, and it is an online only platform there
[4291.60 → 4297.20] should be an opportunity some kind of grace period where you can download it and then have it forever
[4297.20 → 4302.80] um I don't know how they would administer that but lawmakers sort of rarely worry about those kinds
[4302.80 → 4307.12] of minor details anyway so they would just legislate it and let people figure out how to deal with it
[4307.12 → 4311.60] we've run into all kinds of stuff like that with like international taxation for LTT store and all that
[4311.60 → 4318.40] but um separate conversation um Adam says inflation has nothing to do with the rising cost of education
[4318.40 → 4323.84] uh I didn't say it did inflation is sort of separate um but what I said was that those things are
[4323.84 → 4327.60] happening in parallel the cost of living is going up and the cost of education is going up and if
[4327.60 → 4333.44] you're a student the cost of education is part of your cost of living and then okay this is getting
[4333.44 → 4337.12] interesting the state and federal governments were heavily subsidizing education and much of
[4337.12 → 4341.76] those funds were eliminated in the 80s I don't know if you noticed but um the state and federal
[4341.76 → 4348.08] government of the US and Canada are all still heavily subsidizing education uh it's just we've cut it off
[4348.08 → 4355.76] at 12 now for some reason and also uh if our local primo university UBC is anything to go by uh they're
[4355.76 → 4361.20] also just making mad bank when I thought education was supposed to be about passing down knowledge
[4361.20 → 4367.52] have you seen the amount of construction uh Ivan and i both went to UBC, and we went there on a date
[4367.52 → 4374.72] for our 10 years of dating anniversary we went there 15 years I think um we didn't recognize the campus
[4374.72 → 4382.16] like the amount of money they are spending when actually tuition could just be cheaper is
[4382.80 → 4387.60] incredible, and it's not just it's not on educational facilities necessarily a lot of it is
[4387.60 → 4394.48] very commercial uh very development centric let's build some apartments and then do 100-year leases
[4394.48 → 4399.68] so that we still own this land and effectively somebody else pays to put housing on this like
[4399.68 → 4406.56] endowment land that we were given 100 years ago or whatever it's like pretty disgusting um yeah has
[4406.56 → 4412.48] nothing to do maybe something to do with, but it is not as simple as there's not enough subsidies and
[4412.48 → 4417.04] if the government's not subsidizing education enough then I've got a sort of big question for you
[4417.04 → 4422.24] why the not it's sort of the most important possible thing
[4423.44 → 4426.48] who is going to keep the economy going when you are retired
[4426.48 → 4431.28] right like who is going to make it, so your standard of living doesn't suck
[4431.28 → 4436.80] a well-educated working class well you can't get there unless you have the well-educated part
[4437.60 → 4444.00] yeah yeah uh Logan says oh yeah go ahead as a society you should kind of want that too because
[4444.00 → 4448.88] more not necessarily well-informed because that's not fair I just don't want to be surrounded by people
[4448.88 → 4454.96] who are like impossible to talk to I mean how much is that that's not unreasonable that's one of the
[4454.96 → 4458.80] reasons I started a company and then hired all people that I'd want to actually spend my day with
[4461.36 → 4466.56] it's such a small thing to ask yeah and like these are people that are in the voting
[4466.56 → 4471.84] sphere as well like all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah yeah and I'm not saying just before anyone
[4471.84 → 4477.52] jumps on that either I'm not saying like your education has to be like a English degree like
[4477.52 → 4483.12] extended education could be a trade it could be whatever um, but yeah well education can
[4483.12 → 4488.88] absolutely that it's all education can be a first aid course for all I care just sure
[4489.44 → 4497.12] investing in education is valuable learning new skills and expanding your knowledge base in
[4497.12 → 4501.68] general those things are very valuable to society as a whole it doesn't necessarily matter like I'm
[4501.68 → 4509.76] not trying to compare uh learning how to do various forms of math versus uh learning how to weld like
[4509.76 → 4515.20] I don't it doesn't matter to me those resources being readily available to your citizens is extremely
[4515.20 → 4522.96] valuable so uh what else do we got here Logan says I'm 20 and I live in the lower mainland
[4522.96 → 4527.84] I have no hope of living in my area in the future yeah pretty much uh unless it all crashes hey let's see
[4527.84 → 4533.52] how we go uh Justin says please tell me why you said NVIDIA copied our bar from AMD when it's part of the
[4533.52 → 4538.48] pc express standard but now saying AMD didn't copy intel's hybrid solution come on be consistent and
[4538.48 → 4545.60] fair it's a headline man get over it um NVIDIA copied AMD in actually bothering to implement it
[4545.60 → 4552.24] it's been part of the pc express for a long time and I said AMD didn't copy intel's hybrid solution because
[4552.24 → 4560.16] um arm did it first there MAL says any plans for a second kids book my son's been obsessed with it for
[4560.16 → 4564.48] bedtimes lately and now I can recite every line off the top of my head that's hilarious because even
[4564.48 → 4569.36] I have not memorized it uh yeah I think the second one's going to be counting with computers we're gonna
[4569.36 → 4576.80] have some fun with the uh what's a computer thing and uh it'll be everything's a computer so we'll
[4576.80 → 4581.92] oh boy we'll be counting a little outdated by then it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because it'll just
[4581.92 → 4586.00] it'll be a fun rhyme, and it'll be just an inside joke for people who like get it or whatever
[4586.00 → 4591.68] and then every page will be a different kind of computer because computers are all around us right
[4591.68 → 4598.08] uh so we'll start with ones that are maybe more traditional like a desktop computer one
[4598.08 → 4606.00] desktop computer uh, uh two laptops uh uh uh you know three uh tablets four smartwatches whatever so
[4606.00 → 4611.60] you kind of keep going and I think that's um a pretty low-hanging fruit kind of easy one for me to
[4611.60 → 4615.36] do I've been really busy lately I haven't had any time to work on it but I think that's going to be the
[4615.36 → 4620.56] next concept so like uh you'll have the abc one, and then we'll do accounting one and then maybe we'll
[4620.56 → 4624.72] do you know shapes and colours like all that kind of stuff, but it's going to take time uh we are we
[4624.72 → 4629.60] are way past our break-even point for our initial order of ABCs of gaming though so it's been it i
[4629.60 → 4636.48] consider it a success already, and it is likely to continue we've sold over 10 000 copies like it's
[4637.20 → 4643.52] incredible um actually I really appreciate everyone's support and when I mentioned that it was on Amazon
[4643.52 → 4649.36] I think it was two shows ago Luke something like that uh immediately the maximum amount we were
[4649.36 → 4655.12] allowed to stock there which is 150 units were gone and you guys have been leaving reviews on it which
[4655.12 → 4660.16] is really incredible obviously that helps a lot and then I think I was talking about this on the last
[4660.16 → 4666.96] show uh Amazon was like hey recommended restock 900 units by the way you can't have more than 595
[4666.96 → 4673.20] units so we sent 595, and we're probably going to blow right through them awesome um tech cab says
[4673.20 → 4681.36] lost chance to get on the property ladder in the early 2000s yeah pretty much uh Daniel says I want
[4681.36 → 4688.00] to use a git repo off a NAS do you know any way to do that without intolerable latency bandwidth is great
[4688.00 → 4691.92] but dealing with hundreds of thousands of tiny files takes forever I mean other than moving to fibre
[4691.92 → 4700.40] optics and not using TCP IP like finding a different protocol that works for you um no not really
[4701.44 → 4706.88] what's your NAS because people run yeah oh yeah it might be it might be a really slow like crappy NAS
[4706.88 → 4713.36] yeah going SSD would help a lot yeah like there's a difference between a NAS which is like a computer
[4713.36 → 4719.68] that you built that has storage on it that you put on your network and like a little Synology box like some
[4719.68 → 4726.16] eight-year-old like cute thing yeah um kinetic says have you seen any of the backlash about the
[4726.16 → 4734.00] latest YouTube app update and the default video quality stuff I can't say that I have um not even
[4734.00 → 4737.52] a real channel says hey on your EK water blocks active backplates made you talked about how the
[4737.52 → 4742.48] VRAM was getting ridiculously hot on a total 39th trinity the founder's edition has heat sinks on both sides
[4742.48 → 4749.44] uh so does the total, but we removed it to make it easier to get thermal images it was slightly cooler
[4749.44 → 4754.64] with the backplate it doesn't make as much of a difference as you might think all right there's
[4754.64 → 4762.96] some stuff in here um Austin says any update on the verified actual gamers versus Linus event uh yes
[4762.96 → 4770.56] we have already run it uh the video is coming soon I believe it's going to hit float plane in uh early
[4770.56 → 4777.04] access which has not been a week lately I'm sorry we're trying uh no it looks like it is a simultaneous
[4777.04 → 4785.44] release on the fourth um, so float plane is getting the gaming uh gaming phone roundup
[4786.00 → 4794.08] this weekend along with a dozen 4750g review and uh wait okay I don't know what's going on it looks like
[4794.08 → 4800.72] the schedule is broken I will have to um I'll have to find out what's going on with that uh okay
