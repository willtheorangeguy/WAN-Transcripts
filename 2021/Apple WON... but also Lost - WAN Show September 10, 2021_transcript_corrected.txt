[0.00 → 10.64] hey welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen it's going to be a good one today
[10.64 → 19.84] the verdict was finally rendered there's a ruling in the apple versus epic case and they
[19.84 → 25.96] both won which is another way of saying they both lost so we're going to be talking through what
[25.96 → 33.24] exactly that means as our headline topic of the show today in other maybe less headline but
[33.24 → 40.90] certainly concerning news privacy-based email might not be as private as you think it is we're
[40.90 → 48.00] going to be chatting about proton mail removing the whole we do not keep an yip logs bit from
[48.00 → 53.94] their privacy policy what else we got today uh if you thought that the Snapchat sunglasses were an
[53.94 → 60.28] absolutely smash hit well I've got something for you Facebook now has sunglasses that can record
[60.28 → 66.70] video and apparently my birds both want some um we'll talk about those later also riot is enforcing
[66.70 → 74.16] TPM and secure boot in Valorant on Windows 11 pcs really you think that's a headline topic Luke
[74.16 → 78.82] all right well that's going to be a big deal that's going to be half the debate that's going to be half
[78.82 → 81.76] the debate whether that's a headline topic or not let's roll that intro
[81.76 → 91.08] what other topic would you put a headline oh oh oh you're challenging me now yeah how about
[91.08 → 98.12] bitcoin becoming the legal tender in El Salvador chaos ensues that's pretty good wasn't there already
[98.12 → 106.86] chaos there how about the Sony PlayStation games showcase yeah yeah do you care about that
[106.86 → 114.40] uh you know a single one of them ahead of time um how about the Matrix Resurrections trailer
[114.40 → 122.88] have you watched it okay all right so that really was all we had okay fine um the show is
[122.88 → 131.52] brought to you today by jump cloud tux care and of course a fresh books they're fresh all right
[131.52 → 138.98] so let's jump right into apple the epic three months after the trial concluded judge Yvonne
[138.98 → 146.48] Gonzalez rogers ruled in favour of apple on most counts that epic failed to show that apple was a
[146.48 → 154.38] monopolist that epic breached developer contract so the Fortnite ban was therefore justified and that
[154.38 → 160.66] epic must pay apple 30 of the revenue from epic direct payments that were taken through Fortnite on
[160.66 → 168.14] iOS uh so that's approximately 12 million total revenue so I guess 30 percent of that from August to
[168.14 → 176.62] October 2020 and then an unknown amount from November to the present, but epic did win on one important
[176.62 → 183.76] count third party payment systems uh the ruling stated that apple is not breaking antitrust laws but
[183.76 → 189.70] that they are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour which in my opinion is just another way of saying that
[189.70 → 197.42] the antitrust laws need to be updated uh for the digital age, but that's a whole that's a separate
[197.42 → 203.88] conversation um or that they need to make a new law that anti-competitive behaviour is bad I mean what
[203.88 → 212.44] does it oh okay it doesn't matter um the point is through a permanent injunction apple is now restrained
[212.44 → 217.98] and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons
[217.98 → 224.14] oh from including in their apps and their metadata buttons external links or other calls to action
[224.14 → 232.86] that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms um, so this has to be in addition uh in addition to in-app
[232.86 → 239.92] purchasing, and they are not allowed to prohibit developers uh from communicating with their
[239.92 → 243.68] customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account
[243.68 → 251.06] registration within the app so basically the way that it worked before for iOS apps was that unless
[251.06 → 259.24] you had uh so Netflix for example just had a sign-in the app did absolutely nothing until you signed in
[259.24 → 266.50] and you just had to somehow know already with your giant space brain that you had to go on Netflix's
[266.50 → 275.14] website whether it's on a pc or on your mobile browser create a Netflix account pay for it and then you
[275.14 → 280.70] could go sign in in the app so it just had to be this like blank wall with no instructions which is
[280.70 → 288.46] obviously a terrible customer experience um so that's the way it worked before to manage to have
[288.46 → 296.16] outside of app store payments now what the judge is saying is that apple cannot prevent you from having a
[296.16 → 303.30] button in your app that basically says okay click this to go create an account and pay and then
[303.30 → 310.48] you can go back to the app and use it as you normally would it's way less toxic now because that's like
[310.48 → 314.40] like if they don't want you to be able to pay through the app or whatever like that's kind of
[314.40 → 319.12] weird and stuff but at the very least let us communicate that to the user etc and previously
[319.12 → 324.42] the answer to that was no and now the answer to that is going to have to be yes which is way better
[324.42 → 329.20] because at least we can tell people what's happening that was the most frustrating thing
[329.20 → 333.34] is people would message our support and be like yeah like I tried to use your app but like it was
[333.34 → 338.24] really weird I couldn't like do stuff it's like yeah we know there's just nothing we can do about it
[338.24 → 345.10] yeah um now Tim Sweeney seems to think that this isn't a win for developers I was gonna I was going to jump
[345.10 → 354.20] in with something real quick here now something that I don't know is uh how exactly um how exactly
[354.20 → 361.18] this is going to be implemented, so the judge did specify buttons external links or other calls to
[361.18 → 368.68] action apple has to allow them, but that doesn't necessarily mean that apple has to allow third-party
[368.68 → 376.54] payment services within the app itself so it might only be a link leading outside the app like in
[376.54 → 384.26] Japan so South Korea meanwhile has made it so that apple has to allow in-app third-party payment services
[384.26 → 391.28] so we don't know what this is going to end up looking like in the U.S. either way there's at least
[391.28 → 398.42] something you can do here this is significantly better than what it was um in an I'm going to go
[398.42 → 402.08] through Tim Sweeney's statement really quickly because I want to say a statement that applies
[402.08 → 406.90] to both things uh Tim Sweeney said this isn't a win for developers or for consumers epic is fighting
[406.90 → 414.32] for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers so i this isn't
[414.32 → 421.12] I would say this isn't like winning the war for developers and consumers no, but this is definitely a
[421.12 → 425.92] win of a battle this is definitely a significant improvement over what we had before
[425.92 → 433.08] um this isn't what Tim wants and this isn't the end goal of what I would want no um, but it's still
[433.08 → 442.40] way better than what we had and uh Mr Sweeney Mr Sweeney overall is not super happy I actually read
[442.40 → 450.04] through everything he's tweeted since the uh the judge issued this ruling, and he's overall not
[450.04 → 461.46] impressed um and in this and we're in a situation now where even though uh
[461.46 → 469.80] even though epic kind of won in terms of now they can just have a button in the Fortnite app that could
[469.80 → 477.60] link you to a website where you could buy bucks um Tim is still saying I should say Tim Sweeney because
[477.60 → 486.26] apple also has Tim Cook this is Tim versus Tim grudge match um so Tim Sweeney also probably recognizes
[486.26 → 494.30] that entering payment information separately from what you've already got set up with touch ID or face
[494.30 → 502.06] ID is a significant source of friction, and you hear the term friction used a lot to talk about
[502.06 → 510.40] getting customers from the awareness end of the sales funnel to the transaction end of the
[510.40 → 516.74] sales funnel and the less friction you can have along the way the better, and we've probably all done it
[516.74 → 524.72] whether it's the friction of you know um a tedious uh like a tedious um
[524.72 → 531.10] oh what's the word I'm looking for those stupid little cat yeah a tedious captcha that you have
[531.10 → 534.64] to do in order to get to the cart yeah you know what I just didn't really need that thing that badly
[534.64 → 540.82] anyway or your autofill for your payment information not working you know what maybe I'll buy this later
[540.82 → 546.76] and then you never do uh things like that like Amazon it's also the other end to talk about low
[546.76 → 552.40] friction um that's that's the entire reason why when you're going through a lot of stores I know best
[552.40 → 558.24] buy is hilarious for this because they basically put you through a maze um and that the walls of
[558.24 → 564.44] that maze is little things that don't cost way too much you know, but it's very easy for you to just
[564.44 → 571.38] be going by oh yeah I could grab one of those I need some batteries I could take some chips um I could
[571.38 → 576.36] use a new whatever just cable HDMI cable whatever they have all those things lying around the end because
[576.36 → 580.78] it's very low friction to grab those and buy them at the end so Tim Sweeney is not happy with the ruling
[580.78 → 586.72] and there are other reasons for him to not be happy um apple recently rejected epic's request to
[586.72 → 591.72] reinstate its developer account so that they could relaunch Fortnite in South Korea where third party
[591.72 → 598.40] in-app payments will soon be required on iOS and that's obviously the thing that got Fortnite banned
[598.40 → 604.72] in the first place but here's the thing apple is not legally under any kind of obligation to
[604.72 → 611.28] reinstate epics dev account until they fall in line outside of South Korea where that is not the
[611.28 → 617.58] law at least not yet so if apple decides that they want to be vindictive about this which I could
[617.58 → 626.52] I could absolutely see this being real personal here at this point uh Fortnite might not ever return to
[626.52 → 633.10] iOS devices um apple says that they're happy with the ruling i I really doubt it but I think for apple
[633.10 → 641.22] this third party payment systems battle is clearly over now that we've seen rulings in Japan
[641.22 → 649.26] South Korea and the U.S. it's a matter of time before this uh this flood just cannot be held back
[649.26 → 654.84] so that what else are they supposed to say about it, but it's also possible that both companies will
[654.84 → 661.40] appeal at some point so it could be that none of this is final, so overall here's our here's really
[661.40 → 669.64] our discussion around this Luke is this a win for consumers that's question number one and for
[669.64 → 675.06] developers and consumers, and you can speak to both of those from your own personal experience
[675.06 → 679.90] so, so like I said earlier I think this is the win of a battle but not the win of a war
[679.90 → 686.46] I think this is a better experience for consumers and I think you are able to make a
[686.46 → 694.28] product that doesn't feel basically just like broken as a developer because like coming from a
[694.28 → 701.18] developer standpoint not being able to communicate to a user that something is going wrong is really
[701.18 → 708.06] just dumb and bad like yeah you screwed up you if something goes wrong or the user can't do something
[708.06 → 712.28] you should be commuting like that's really, really basic user experience you should be able to
[712.28 → 718.02] communicate to the user what is wrong or or or give the user an option and the fact that you couldn't
[718.02 → 722.00] do either of those things in the past is terrible, and it was a terrible user experience for the
[722.00 → 729.56] consumers right like oh I want let's use Netflix I won't even use float plane I want Netflix I'm a new
[729.56 → 734.94] Netflix subscriber I am one of many people in the world that are mainly consumed content through my phone
[734.94 → 744.04] I'm going to open the Netflix app on my phone what like what do I do am I just not allowed to
[744.04 → 749.72] use Netflix is it maybe not fully compatible with my phone like it's its just a terrible user experience
[749.72 → 755.04] across the board so yeah i think it is an improvement um but I do agree with Tim that
[755.04 → 761.32] this isn't like a full win this isn't a win of the war now here's kind of the big question at this
[761.32 → 767.50] point I think when this whole thing went down um you and I were I think pretty close to being on the
[767.50 → 774.28] same page that epic was doing the right thing I mean fundamentally I agree with them that apple is
[774.28 → 780.74] and you could call it you could call it monopolistic you could call it you could say it's its an antitrust
[780.74 → 786.32] violation you could say it's anti-competitive it doesn't matter because they're all just kind of
[786.32 → 797.66] heads different heads of the same monster it's all a company abusing a position of power that
[797.66 → 806.74] makes it impossible for other entities to compete with them and abusing a position of power that in
[806.74 → 812.60] a way that they wouldn't be able to if other entities were able to compete with them in a
[812.60 → 818.18] in a completely fair and open market and the word fair I used that intentionally because it can mean
[818.18 → 824.56] a lot of different things you could make the argument that the competition that we have now is
[824.56 → 830.82] is fair because someone else could just make a really great product and make lots of money and
[830.82 → 836.64] lobby lawmakers that's fair well yeah that's like a kind of fair but not everyone actually
[836.64 → 842.48] has those kinds of resources and that shouldn't be might should not make right should just be
[842.48 → 851.26] right so I think you and I were kind of on the same page that epic was absolutely fighting uh a just
[851.26 → 860.56] and noble battle but for not necessarily the most just or noble reasons you know obviously they had
[860.56 → 868.02] their eye on that you know 30 percent of the money that they could that they were just giving there's a
[868.02 → 872.92] huge amount of personal gain for epic going into this yeah they've tried to frame it as like
[872.92 → 879.96] oh no we're just doing this for everyone else and like yeah if they win that full war that I've
[879.96 → 885.98] been referencing uh that would be very positive for let's say they don't let's say this is as far as it
[885.98 → 892.58] gets did they effectively just throw themselves upon their own sword for nothing but the benefit of
[892.58 → 898.62] everyone else because if they don't intentionally, but that's probably why Tim's upset if they don't
[898.62 → 905.48] get their developer account reinstated they are not going to be getting any bucks anywhere even where
[905.48 → 913.24] in-app payments are mandated, or third-party in-app payments are uh allowed by law uh so they will get
[913.24 → 920.64] literally nothing and will have burned all of that sweet 70 percent of bucks money that they
[920.64 → 926.84] could have taken uh for I mean years of potentially being off the app store I mean
[926.84 → 937.72] apple as a organization um to to to imagine that they would be anything other than vindictive
[937.72 → 945.96] about this crusade that epic has made very personal i I wouldn't actually say that it's apple that made
[945.96 → 952.50] this personal epic has made it has made it they've they've taken it public they've appealed to their
[952.50 → 958.94] individual users to try to sort of wage a war of consumer pressure against apple like they've
[958.94 → 965.20] fought tooth and nail, and you could even make the argument they fought pretty dirty here um
[965.20 → 973.76] but at the end of the day I guess when it was fighting pretty dirty before epic even
[973.76 → 980.40] joined the ring so I think I feel like they kind of stooped to their level but yeah i um it's its
[980.40 → 986.68] interesting it's its I appreciate you know I appreciate the handout um from the company that
[986.68 → 993.40] seems to be very happy to steal everything they can from everyone else thanks epic I appreciate it um
[993.40 → 1000.80] they like or not steal but like direct copy I guess i just every time i I start trying to think
[1000.80 → 1005.58] about epic in a positive light I'm like oh yeah they just like completely copied pub g and then among
[1005.58 → 1016.52] us very cool maybe they're not entirely on the side of like other developers you know yeah but yeah
[1016.52 → 1021.38] this was like I said this is a benefit for us this is a big benefit for float plane I'm very happy that
[1021.38 → 1027.56] this happened um it's this it is going to be very nice to be able to communicate to our users properly
[1027.56 → 1033.48] about what's going on do I think this is going to like to drive a bunch of subscriptions no um do I think
[1033.48 → 1043.32] it's going to create some less confused people yeah all right now let's talk about this is kind
[1043.32 → 1049.70] one of the big topics of this week um proton mail proton mail has had a reputation
[1049.70 → 1055.96] for a long time actually I mean this goes man how long is proton mail just kind of been the de facto
[1055.96 → 1065.24] you know private email service because it's its free unlike a lot of a lot of sorts of private uh
[1065.24 → 1072.28] like uh private mail services um they had a really bulletproof looking privacy policy
[1072.28 → 1080.24] and when I say had I really do mean had uh this is kind of a big deal proton mail has removed
[1080.24 → 1088.40] a statement from their privacy policy that said that they do not keep an yip logs so uh Luke why would
[1088.40 → 1098.08] it is important that your email provider not retain IP logs well because if is someone either broke
[1098.08 → 1105.42] into that service um so like black-hat hackers um or something of that sort broke into that service
[1105.42 → 1111.80] they could acquire that data um or if they are asked for that data by some form of government
[1111.80 → 1117.72] entity if they in both of those cases if they just don't have it, it's really not that big of a problem
[1117.72 → 1127.06] um if they get broken into by some hackery boys or girls or whatever um and there's nothing
[1127.06 → 1132.20] there for them to take it doesn't really matter right it's a little spooky and you have to maybe
[1132.20 → 1137.72] batten down the hatches a little bit, but you didn't lose anything so who cares um but if you are holding
[1137.72 → 1142.30] all this data then it's then it's an issue, and it's there and uh it could be a regulator that's going
[1142.30 → 1148.24] after it, so proton mail is a Swiss company, and they were obliged to follow a Swiss court injunction
[1148.24 → 1152.50] demanding that they begin logging IP addresses and browser fingerprint information
[1152.50 → 1160.32] so the account that they went after was uh operated by a Parisian chapter of youth for climate
[1160.32 → 1166.50] um their cause is fighting against gentrification high-end establishments and real estate speculation
[1166.50 → 1175.02] among other things um proton mail points out that the email contents were not handed over just
[1175.02 → 1180.86] logging info because the email body itself is encrypted with keys that are unavailable to the
[1180.86 → 1192.42] servers that are processing them so is proton mail still chill then i I would not say 100 chill
[1192.42 → 1200.04] you know now Vilnius in the float plane chat says proton mail's response to this issue was absolutely
[1200.04 → 1205.98] a plus full honest uh the issue is absurd you should not use email for any kind of secure communications
[1205.98 → 1219.04] I mean okay fair enough, but you might need to um and if people understood at least thought that proton
[1219.04 → 1225.38] mail was this completely secure method of communication uh that was the kind of
[1225.38 → 1227.60] yeah exactly it's been communicated that way
[1227.60 → 1236.22] um now Vilnius also says that proton mail cannot access your email, and you can get around this by
[1236.22 → 1244.36] simply using a fake IP uh with a VPN or with tor so I guess it comes down to that there is no such
[1244.36 → 1251.28] thing as just you know one tool that you can use to maintain your privacy and or your anonymity online
[1251.28 → 1257.94] uh I think a lot of VPNs have gotten themselves in hot water by claiming that a VPN is some kind of
[1257.94 → 1265.12] magic bullet that makes you anonymous online and in the same way proton mail probably just needed to
[1265.12 → 1268.60] or maybe look this is the community's fault it might have been yeah it might have been community
[1268.60 → 1275.28] communication so bulletproof but in the same way proton mail is not just a one-size-fits-all
[1275.28 → 1283.38] perfect way to maintain absolute privacy uh you need a combination of tools and not just tools but
[1283.38 → 1292.06] also best practices I mean even tor is not enough to maintain your privacy um for example uh if you
[1292.06 → 1299.16] will use tor at your native resolution, and you happen to be running an uh a Surface Book 2 let me just
[1299.16 → 1305.22] double check what the resolution of this thing is um yeah okay this one's pretty good which runs
[1305.22 → 1314.66] at 3240 by 2160 it's a very unusual resolution one of the things that websites can see is what the
[1314.66 → 1321.48] resolution of the display that you're browsing from is so that's the reason that tor will actually
[1321.48 → 1328.00] launch at a default small window size, and you're not supposed to adjust it you're supposed to leave
[1328.00 → 1335.08] it is like that because as soon as you start giving a website any bit of information you can start to
[1335.08 → 1341.54] create like as you click through and navigate or visit frequently accessed sites
[1341.54 → 1347.16] they start to look for patterns, and they can start to put together a fingerprint for you that can be
[1347.16 → 1355.80] used to maybe not identify you the individual you know Jeremy smith but to identify you and start to
[1355.80 → 1361.00] build an advertising profile for you which is usually what these online services are after so that
[1361.00 → 1365.94] they can there's one there's one Jeremy smith out there that like wasn't really paying that much
[1365.94 → 1372.84] attention yeah then just all of a sudden is like whoa sorry I should clarify tor browser
[1372.84 → 1381.64] excuse me um oh man jack of gamers asks what do you think of pa's new multi-hop option I have
[1381.64 → 1387.00] not actually looked into it but if it's what it sounds like then it's going to hurt latency but
[1387.00 → 1397.00] improve privacy so hey there you go so overall this is not the end of the world you can absolutely
[1397.00 → 1405.08] continue to use proton mail you just need to be aware that every time and I mean every time you log into
[1405.08 → 1412.12] proton mail you should be using a VPN, and ideally you should be making sure that you are accessing it from
[1412.12 → 1420.20] uh different VPN endpoints so you should yeah and especially if you're like there's a note
[1420.20 → 1426.12] about this too um there's a discussion question if you're an activist of any sort is it time to use tor
[1426.12 → 1432.44] browsers and VPNs can you trust anonymous email services I would answer that somewhat indirectly by
[1432.44 → 1440.12] saying if you're is you're an activist in a country that is dangerously oppressive to what you're being an
[1440.12 → 1446.84] activist about um I'm not going to try to make any like you know assumptions about what that is or
[1446.84 → 1451.16] where you are or anything like that I'm just talking generally what are you trying not to get us deleted
[1451.16 → 1458.28] in China I wasn't even thinking about china but um have you seen some of the stuff they've been doing
[1458.28 → 1465.80] lately no I've been checked out to be completely honest Mulan is like deleted from the internet the
[1465.80 → 1471.80] actress I mean like just like their new thing is if you are is you are not if you are not waving
[1471.80 → 1480.20] the flag hard enough you simply do not exist any more it's a whole thing yeah anyway yeah um don't trust
[1480.20 → 1487.32] anything the question here is can you trust anonymous email services don't trust anything layer up
[1489.00 → 1494.52] use multiple endpoints try to use the most secure thing you can pay attention to these types of things
[1494.52 → 1500.04] that are happening um watch the news for the various services you use like proton mail make sure that
[1500.04 → 1505.32] it's still kind of above board and be ready to switch very quickly and don't be dependent on any one thing
[1506.04 → 1514.04] don't use just one VPN etc etc etc yep all right man I love hopping into YouTube chat every once in a
[1514.04 → 1521.72] while it's just manned it manages to be so off-topic uh fit tax the churches says fit for flogging jungle cruise
[1521.72 → 1529.08] part two is coming says RC what show were you guys watching I don't even understand one of course
[1530.44 → 1536.92] uh join new sponsors yeah let's get uh let's get those sponsors done uh jump cloud thanks to jump
[1536.92 → 1543.96] cloud for sponsoring today's wand show whoops uh but there we go jump cloud is a leading cloud directory
[1543.96 → 1548.52] platform that makes it easier to solve today's it challenges by unifying device and user management
[1548.52 → 1553.40] through a single pane of glass with jump cloud securely managing your users and their devices
[1553.40 → 1558.76] doing common things like onboarding and offboarding remote workers is easy which as you can imagine
[1558.76 → 1565.64] is a much bigger concern today than it was 18 months ago uh that that's pre that's pre-covid right
[1566.84 → 1571.64] don't take my word for it though you can try jump cloud for free today at jumpcloud.com and help your
[1571.64 → 1579.00] organization move to a modern secure hybrid work model yeah that's man we're small enough that and
[1579.00 → 1585.00] everyone's kind of you know trusted enough that we've never really worried about people just you know
[1585.00 → 1590.44] taking their work devices home or bringing their home devices to work we're all also reasonably tech
[1590.44 → 1597.72] savvy, but we are getting to the point where we're not far away from needing to use services like this to
[1597.72 → 1605.32] make sure that all of our um yeah it's onboarding and offboarding is done in in a bulletproof
[1605.32 → 1612.20] kind of airtight way so that people can't just start poking around at stuff like I have no idea exactly
[1612.20 → 1621.24] how much an asset like the Linus tech tips YouTube channel is worth but a fair bit I would imagine you
[1621.24 → 1631.24] know to the point where if I was some kind of very if I was a savvy and yet stupid bad actor you know i
[1631.24 → 1638.04] might I might infiltrate the organization uh you know try to social engineer my way into the credentials
[1638.04 → 1644.28] and then take off with it not realizing of course that I literally have a phone number for someone at
[1644.28 → 1648.36] YouTube who can get my channel back to me in minutes if something like that were to happen
[1648.36 → 1653.88] and you know so they'd have to be they'd have to be both smart and dumb but um you know hey have you
[1653.88 → 1658.76] ever do you guys ever watch those compilations of like uh convenience store burglars and stuff

[1678.68 → 1683.48] don't think I've watched a compilation of it but I have seen a lot of them so I don't yeah I don't know

[1842.12 → 1851.24] resurrections trailer oh my goodness dude I was saving it I was saving it for this so hold on a second
[1851.24 → 1858.28] here we go okay I'm ready are you ready are you showing it on screen I was going to I guess I'm
[1858.28 → 1864.44] gonna I'm going to end up getting the stupid stream that's what I'm thinking you know what yeah okay hold
[1864.44 → 1873.40] on a second I'm gonna this is my this is my genius uh anti-copyright strike uh strategy it's the number
[1873.40 → 1878.52] one on YouTube trending right now I got this I got this hold on a second I'm ready I'm ready okay I'm just
[1878.52 → 1884.76] going to put I'm just going to take this and I'm going to put this right here okay we go
[1886.44 → 1890.60] let me know when you hold on a second hold on a second right out of the gate can I just say that
[1891.32 → 1897.08] this looks really fake oh it's one of the fakest looking shots I've like ever seen in a modern movie
[1897.64 → 1904.76] how does it look this fake like i i think Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone had better CGI
[1904.76 → 1910.68] and that came out in like 2001. The worst part is I actually started this for a while and really
[1910.68 → 1915.72] questioned because it looks really, really fake right, but it looks so fake to the point where I was
[1915.72 → 1924.28] like is it actually real and just like shot weird it could be it could be like are they trying to put
[1924.28 → 1930.60] you off here you know it looks like a render okay here we go yeah number one on trending okay we got a
[1930.60 → 1941.00] cat there's a black cat seem particularly triggered right now uh okay
[1945.56 → 1953.88] has Keanu ever won the sexiest man alive I don't know but I feel he deserves it in my heart he has yeah
[1953.88 → 1962.68] okay he's in the bath he's crying in the bath uh oh, oh sup trinity
[1969.80 → 1982.92] okay wait, so this is like a reboot he doesn't know he's neo again um right now yeah notice the blue
[1982.92 → 1991.48] pills though what obviously, and then he throws the blue pills away and then Alice in Wonderland which
[1991.48 → 1997.48] was a big part of the first one and then the mirror and Morpheus is back except we're there and
[1997.48 → 2004.60] except they're not really because it's not the same guy because he dies in a video game, and they're
[2004.60 → 2018.60] treating that as canon really yep why who knows
[2022.92 → 2033.96] oh okay wait, so this is just this is just the matrix he has to learn about the matrix again
[2034.60 → 2044.92] I mean in fairness uh you know what I think I'm done I think I'm done here uh in fair
[2046.36 → 2052.84] in fairness there's I mean the the the matrix sequels kind of had the superman problem
[2052.84 → 2059.56] where as soon as your superhero can do anything and wait wait wait jump back to it and jump to
[2059.56 → 2065.48] two minutes and 28 seconds I mean I was almost there anyway I guess okay, so there's a bunch of
[2065.48 → 2071.64] action sequences there's cool people with guns there's big none of that matters just okay yeah here we go
[2077.48 → 2080.36] yeah okay um
[2082.04 → 2089.08] we're going back to the future Linus yeah yeah I mean okay right so back to what I was saying like i
[2089.08 → 2096.52] I don't I don't personally really enjoy um superhero franchises where the super is too super
[2096.52 → 2103.56] I find superman incredibly boring I find uh Captain Marvel incredibly boring for the same reason because
[2103.56 → 2113.48] they're basically the same hero um i i I think that's a big part of why uh why Iron Man sort of kicked off
[2113.48 → 2122.12] the modern superhero obsession that we have because he was deeply flawed like really extremely unlikeable
[2122.12 → 2129.24] uh for the vast majority of that movie um and that that's sort of that's why he's great because he's
[2129.24 → 2136.84] actually just sort of uh like a garbage tier guy with no fighting skills uh, and he's like a jerk and
[2136.84 → 2143.48] um like he's very he's actually really weak without his suit of armour whether it's a metaphorical suit
[2143.48 → 2148.20] or a literal suit you can kind of get into that if you really feel like it uh I don't feel like it
[2148.20 → 2156.68] um and so neo was inherently boring as soon as the first film was over because he's like too powerful
[2156.68 → 2162.44] how do you keep raising the stakes you just you have to have you have to have monsters that are you know
[2162.44 → 2167.08] literally the size of planets for him to fight you know what I mean like it just it's just it's
[2167.08 → 2175.56] boring right so I guess you know what I've talked myself into it, I'm going to see it I'm going to see it
[2175.56 → 2181.96] on I'm going to see it right at launch I'm I'm excited now nice reboot you are excited I am I'm
[2181.96 → 2187.88] ready you're genuinely excited I'm ready for I'm ready for us to just kind of do this but do it
[2187.88 → 2198.20] better because honestly speaking 1999 the matrix um revolutionary at the time pun intended we're
[2198.20 → 2206.60] not actually yeah, yeah revolutionary at the time um not a great movie you go back and re-watch it
[2206.60 → 2212.04] like knowing the twist now that it's not really a twist anymore, and it's like it's okay I think it
[2212.04 → 2217.40] also got copied a lot though which is part of the reason why it's not very great i know so
[2217.40 → 2223.88] so you know let's let's revisit the idea with modern sensibilities uh you know Keanu's back
[2224.52 → 2228.76] for whatever reason a video game is canon uh you know let's just let's just let that we'll
[2228.76 → 2235.80] let that happen I'm going to be open-minded I'm I'm ready I'm ready with that said oh yeah go ahead
[2235.80 → 2240.04] I don't know everything that happened I just read something online about how apparently they are
[2240.04 → 2246.52] treating I believe it was the matrix MMO and like one or two other video games or something as I was
[2246.52 → 2255.88] like yeah did anyone even play that I thought no there was a surprising amount of comments of
[2255.88 → 2260.44] people being like well I played the MMO, and it was amazing, and the writing was perfect because like
[2260.44 → 2269.56] the Wachowskis were I hope I pronounced that right uh were involved um but i I knew no one that played and
[2269.56 → 2274.28] i and I know that it went down like really quick probably because their player numbers were abysmal
[2274.28 → 2283.32] um do you know about the project where like I think it was one guy or something tried to
[2283.96 → 2291.96] like reverse engineer the matrix online like servers and like tried to save as much of the game
[2291.96 → 2299.00] as possible and tried to make like uh is is that project still, still active I heard about that
[2299.00 → 2305.96] years ago but i I have no idea what happened to it uh I'd like I'd love to yeah float plane chat was not
[2305.96 → 2314.04] super, super into uh not super into the matrix online okay fair enough
[2316.20 → 2319.64] last I'm excited to see this movie
[2319.64 → 2329.96] I don't trust that it's going to be good but I'm excited to see it in the same way uh maybe not the
[2329.96 → 2335.80] same way no not nearly as doom and gloom um but I feel like I don't know if excited is the right
[2335.80 → 2339.32] term either I feel like I need to go see it in the same way that I needed to go see all the new star
[2339.32 → 2347.00] wars movies oh no, no no, no I'm not i I don't I'm not anywhere near as doom and gloomy but I think
[2347.00 → 2351.80] it's going to be not good no the matrix is not dead to me in the way that Star Wars is but then again
[2351.80 → 2359.56] I never saw the last one I just didn't last matrix yeah it's I believe you the second one was bad
[2359.56 → 2366.36] enough that i I had absolutely no need to see the third one whatsoever so, so maybe I do think that
[2366.36 → 2374.52] saved me maybe that makes it so that i can go into matrix 4 like ready for it to not be bad
[2375.24 → 2382.04] so someone said Luke's just a Keanu fanboy yeah he's fantastic and he might make the movie like
[2382.68 → 2387.00] acceptable to a certain degree you know in the same way that like they probably could have made
[2387.00 → 2391.96] the new Star Wars movies somewhat decent if they actually let mark Hamill um act uh that would have
[2391.96 → 2397.08] been pretty sweet that would have been pretty cool he like actually really can act for someone who
[2397.08 → 2402.44] didn't do a ton of acting work and most did mostly do voice acting work he's awesome I love mark Hamill
[2403.00 → 2410.12] um hold on a second so you say you're a big Keanu fan did you actually watch the new bill and Ted movie
[2411.48 → 2417.72] no me neither so can you really say you're a Keanu fan if you didn't even bother to watch the new bill and
[2417.72 → 2426.20] Ted I'd watch it with you, i um i it came out during quarantine didn't it I think, so yeah is it on
[2426.20 → 2432.28] a streaming service now I haven't heard of it being on one um but I wasn't going to see movies like when
[2432.28 → 2439.64] that came out it doesn't matter if I'm a fan or not I'm also like if I'm a fan of an actor or actress
[2439.64 → 2444.60] it's not that much of a fan I don't really I don't really like to follow movies and stuff that much i just
[2444.60 → 2449.40] think Keanu is like pretty cool and I like a lot of the stuff that he's in but all right yeah all
[2449.40 → 2454.92] right I'm ready I'm ready for the Matrix Resurrections um did you watch the Sony PlayStation showcase
[2456.44 → 2463.56] uh no but I followed a fair amount of it the knights of the old republic remake I am very excited for
[2463.56 → 2470.44] the concept if you click on this link you're going to see a trailer um it's one minute and seven seconds
[2470.44 → 2475.72] and like yeah it looks cool except there's text at the bottom of the screen that says not actual
[2475.72 → 2484.44] gameplay, and it's like the most simple freaking cinematic you could ever imagine that is not
[2484.44 → 2492.84] actual gameplay and is very likely and possibly not an engine so it just means nothing like ah
[2493.96 → 2497.88] um okay this is exciting because I never played motor back in the day
[2497.88 → 2505.08] and I've wanted them to make a remake like this whole time because as much as I like retro games
[2505.08 → 2510.04] man motor is particularly really painful to go play it's like going back and trying to play like
[2510.04 → 2517.40] Balder's gate or something like it the mechanics how you move around how you interact with things how
[2517.40 → 2524.28] you do all that kind of stuff is terrible like it's its genuinely kind of like tough to slog through
[2524.28 → 2527.80] I've tried a couple of times and I've never really made it through even though the game is quite
[2527.80 → 2535.56] interesting so I'm pretty excited about the remake but what a waste of a trailer um there's
[2535.56 → 2542.36] definitely some other interesting games this forespoken game um some of the graphics in it look just
[2542.36 → 2548.20] incredible some of the other graphics in it look very old and not good which is kind of confusing
[2548.20 → 2553.48] um like sometimes I'm like wow that's like really close to photorealistic that's amazing to be on like a PS5
[2553.48 → 2559.96] and then you'll see their hair just move as if like NVIDIA hair works was never invented, and it's
[2559.96 → 2567.24] just like wait what's happening why um but the effects if you're is you're more of the AMD persuasion
[2567.96 → 2574.20] yeah yeah it looks interesting though for sure um and then yeah I don't know there's some other
[2574.20 → 2582.36] interesting stuff but a lot of it's PlayStation exclusives um tiny teen is wonderland looks like it
[2582.36 → 2588.44] it could be potentially interesting but I haven't really been interested in something um from
[2588.44 → 2595.88] that line in a while yeah I don't know all right uh Grand Theft Auto 5 being delayed is like genuinely
[2595.88 → 2602.28] hilarious I don't know if there are notes about that in here yeah there is just that it's delayed until uh
[2602.92 → 2610.44] march 2022 or something like how dude i I don't know how can a game that's already out be so
[2610.44 → 2616.04] delayed, and you know like a bunch of people would buy it to that's the crazy part it's just free
[2616.04 → 2622.36] money on the table, and they're just like we'll do it later I don't know you never know though it's
[2622.36 → 2626.44] possible that rock star is working on something behind the scenes that is going to blow all of
[2626.44 → 2635.80] our minds away yeah, but lots of companies outsource the uh the um and how well does that work out for them
[2635.80 → 2641.80] Luke yeah I mean not exactly that how well does that work out for them so sometimes it works out
[2641.80 → 2649.00] quite well usually well you can't have it both ways Luke we always say release it when it's done
[2649.00 → 2656.36] so you know what I say you release GTA 5 when it's done which by my watch is 10 years ago so
[2657.32 → 2665.48] time ago g5 release date we had to come up so 2013 excuse me sorry eight years ago my bad no I'm
[2665.48 → 2669.64] I'm just teasing I'm just teasing rock star I'm sure you guys are working on something that's amazing
[2669.64 → 2678.36] something better than uh this oh boy so check out this press release from Facebook that's right
[2679.16 → 2685.88] smart glasses are here that basically look the same oh no there's music oh awful see you later
[2686.60 → 2694.52] smart glasses are here that basically look like regular old fashionable frames which is
[2695.16 → 2701.64] really cool if you're into wearing smart glasses and kind of terrifying if you're into
[2702.36 → 2708.20] not wearing smart glasses but being anywhere near someone who happens to be wearing smart glasses like
[2708.84 → 2715.16] oh say for example a bathroom so they start at 2.99 which is kind of crazy to me because
[2715.16 → 2720.44] Esther Luxottica and Facebook this must be this must be that Facebook
[2720.44 → 2729.96] um subsidy money you know how the Oculus Quest 2 is like by hundreds of dollars the best value VR
[2729.96 → 2738.20] headset on the market by a country mile like not even close well that's the Facebook subsidy money that
[2738.20 → 2746.76] is making it so affordable and Esther Luxottica is not exactly known for um no, no they're they're they're
[2746.76 → 2752.68] very happy to have their uh their monopoly i was going to make a joke if I opened this topic I was
[2752.68 → 2757.96] planning on making a joke with uh Facebook and the only company that makes sunglasses have teamed up to
[2757.96 → 2765.56] make free band story sunglasses pretty much um so if this is coming in at 2.99 with dual 5 megapixel
[2765.56 → 2772.12] cameras that can record video and photos from this first-person perspective you can bet that Facebook
[2772.12 → 2778.60] is subsidizing the crap out of it because they are expecting some kind of real awesome data now video
[2778.60 → 2787.24] recording is capped at 30 seconds to address privacy concerns uh, but the quality is a square 1184
[2787.24 → 2795.48] uh at 30 frames per second so that's 1184 by 1184 they have four gigs of storage meaning that you could
[2795.48 → 2805.72] restore you could record probably a fair number of 1184 30p clips um but mostly videos and photos are
[2805.72 → 2812.52] managed and stored in a separate Facebook view app the sunglasses include a triple microphone system for
[2812.52 → 2817.88] audio recording phone calls and Facebook assistant which I actually did not even know they had and
[2817.88 → 2823.32] there are speakers in the arms for audio playback these are not headphones or bone conduction they are
[2823.32 → 2830.60] speakers the selling point is they're comfortable fashionable and lightweight just like normal sunglasses
[2830.60 → 2838.60] and make basically every other smart glasses we've seen so far look kind of bulky and stupid but that also
[2838.60 → 2848.36] makes it hard to tell that they are video and audio recording devices, and you might think oh well whatever
[2848.36 → 2854.20] it's in the news everyone's just going to know that Facebook sunglasses are a thing, and you know if you're
[2854.20 → 2860.44] wearing sunglasses inside they'll just be like oh yeah those are Facebook glasses i can see the lens
[2860.44 → 2868.52] through the thing but you have to understand not everybody you know consumes tech news and not every way that
[2868.52 → 2875.48] these could be used to covertly record someone um would be that obvious say for everyone consumes tech
[2875.48 → 2880.52] news I know right they should not everyone sees the quick bits you need your daily dose of tech
[2880.52 → 2888.28] news okay go to tech link three times a week um so what if they're not wearing them right what if they
[2888.28 → 2893.88] throw them in an in an upper pocket and just you know part of it is sticking up out of the pocket or they
[2893.88 → 2897.88] throw the arm over the pocket kind of thing, and it's hanging on the front of them you wouldn't necessarily
[2897.88 → 2906.04] look that closely at that you might not realize that you are being recorded um they have a little light
[2906.04 → 2915.00] um yeah but I mean bands you can just like tardy over the light or like put electrical tape on it or
[2915.00 → 2927.72] something like I don't know yeah it's interesting now Facebook says that um to address privacy concerns
[2928.28 → 2933.88] um they worked with a list of advocacy groups that they consulted when they were developing the glasses
[2934.92 → 2941.72] but New York times reporter Ryan mack noted that Facebook has actually funded at least four out of
[2941.72 → 2950.28] these five groups that they said they consulted at least it might be all five it could be all
[2950.28 → 2961.40] five for all we know oh my goodness I mean to be honest with you the i the um the prospect of being
[2961.40 → 2969.00] able to record truly first person view footage is really exciting to me as a content creator
[2969.00 → 2976.28] um one of the times that I did it was the uh POV pc build uh this video right here
[2977.48 → 2981.80] something just while you're bringing that up something I would say is however you feel about
[2981.80 → 2987.80] this and say these get banned by the government like they never even come out, so your opinions don't even
[2987.80 → 2994.52] matter basically never assume privacy that would be a big tip yeah never pick your nose in your car ever
[2994.52 → 3002.52] again um yeah so right what's so cool about this video is that instead of having the webcam on top of my head
[3002.52 → 3008.28] like people would normally mount them if they had any sense uh it was actually the webcam excuse me GoPro
[3008.28 → 3015.24] it was actually mounted to a headband and then upside down, so the camera was right in front of my eyes
[3015.24 → 3024.44] and that's why compared to when people wear like a helmet mounted GoPro it looks and feels way more
[3024.44 → 3030.76] natural just that few inches but just that few inches having the lens closer to where your eyes
[3030.76 → 3039.32] would actually be makes an enormous difference to um the consumption of this type of content so
[3039.32 → 3049.48] man i could see all I could see all kinds of things being um way more shareable um like experiences
[3050.12 → 3059.32] uh with this technology i just i have deep concerns honestly not even the video so much like
[3059.32 → 3066.92] the audio too just being able to if it's got a three microphone array I am willing to bet especially based
[3066.92 → 3073.80] on what Facebook like the kind of uh r d that they've been doing around uh audio for VR for example
[3073.80 → 3079.64] I am willing to bet this microphone is pretty darn good for something that can be concealed on your body
[3079.64 → 3090.92] in a way that most average people would never notice yeah all right yeah uh I know when uh when google
[3090.92 → 3097.40] glass came out there was a special name for people that wore them glass holes which you didn't even use
[3097.40 → 3106.52] the button oh well I didn't say a bad word glass is not a bad word and holes is not a bad word therefore
[3106.52 → 3113.72] a compound word made up of those two words glass holes cannot be a bad word fair yeah easy solved um
[3113.72 → 3121.32] um that was a big thing people like really stood up against it yeah haven't seen that this time
[3121.32 → 3128.20] around I think there's been a lot of decent as a desensitization to this type of stuff lately um
[3129.24 → 3132.52] and it just yeah I think this one might make it through
[3135.00 → 3140.20] float plane chat is just going on about porn uh john wick says it could be useful as a dash cam for
[3140.20 → 3144.44] riding a bike unfortunately not because it is limited to 30 second clips at a time
[3145.56 → 3152.20] uh john says I'd be way more okay with this if literally anyone else made it besides Facebook
[3152.20 → 3158.44] but should you be I mean would it be any better having people just be able to have access to it in
[3158.44 → 3168.20] some way yeah um oh yeah man there 's's so much uh QWERTY Sam says the arguments against these
[3168.20 → 3173.24] glasses are no different from phones you know you could already secretly record anyone with your phone
[3173.24 → 3179.00] it's it is more difficult uh and someone brought this up uh unit said I've seen some
[3179.00 → 3184.68] disgusting stuff here in city I'm not going to name a particular city but I've seen a guy filming a girl
[3184.68 → 3189.96] from behind on a flight of stairs in public like if people could do it without pulling out their phone
[3189.96 → 3201.56] yeah i I don't I don't like it I don't like it uh a good point uh the mad maker says hackers can
[3201.56 → 3208.12] already make them yeah that's fair, but they wouldn't be as no offence stylish and innocuous
[3210.28 → 3217.56] all right our last big topic for the day is riot will be enforcing TPM and secure boot in Valorant
[3217.56 → 3223.40] on Windows 11 pcs now you picked this as a headline topic tell me why you think this is that important
[3225.88 → 3232.36] uh because nothing else that was in here was really that important and I find it kind of interesting um
[3233.72 → 3238.84] because riot the last time they did this they did it they did a whole ring zero
[3238.84 → 3245.08] BS thing that people were upset about now they're doing TPM um I really like the idea that they are
[3245.08 → 3252.36] hardcore cracking down on cheaters in specifically the shooter game space yeah uh the first person
[3252.36 → 3259.40] shooter space um there are cheaters in basically everything um but cheating in first person
[3259.40 → 3268.84] shooters has been really rough for quite a while now um back when we were the young ins
[3268.84 → 3274.92] cheating in first-person shooters was absolutely a thing but I would highly argue that it was a lot
[3274.92 → 3283.40] less common because it was really rough and these days it's very easy to the point where they will run
[3283.40 → 3289.32] ads on like YouTube yeah to try to get you to go to their website, and you go to their website you pay
[3289.32 → 3294.44] through a payment processor that isn't even that scary you run a program, and you're done, and you're
[3294.44 → 3302.52] cheating it's not complicated it's its very, very accessible um and that has made it really
[3302.52 → 3308.76] crazy like almost every shooter game is just completely rampant with uh with cheating and like
[3308.76 → 3317.32] the thing that really gets me is how common it is that streamers end up getting caught after they've
[3317.32 → 3325.48] been streaming for a long time and have like a quite established audience yeah um like it's pervasive
[3325.48 → 3329.80] it's horrible so I'm happy that they're doing something about it feels really weird um adding
[3329.80 → 3338.20] any amount of tracking stuff to a computer um I do wonder at a certain point if we've been talking for
[3338.20 → 3344.76] a long time about how consoles are becoming computers I am this topic kind of piqued my interest of whether
[3344.76 → 3353.40] gaming computers are going to console slightly interesting so rather than consoles PCF King
[3353.40 → 3357.80] or I mean it's been happening but there, but they'll reach it's a little bit of vocation it's a
[3357.80 → 3365.80] convergence and pcs will get nonsolidified uh but if you want it to be really gaming meanwhile valve is going
[3365.80 → 3376.68] full bore um you know full bore gaming on Linux where I would imagine it would be more difficult
[3376.68 → 3385.80] to enforce I mean I don't know i guess riot could technically enforce um TPM you know what I'm
[3385.80 → 3393.16] going to be honest with you, I have never even thought about whether TPM does anything on Linux or works on
[3393.16 → 3402.12] Linux TPM on Linux uh in Unix and Linux the global temporary oh no, no TMP whoops whoops
[3403.00 → 3409.88] there we go trust platform module arch wiki secure crypto processor dedicated okay so I guess nothing
[3409.88 → 3418.76] would actually prevent um riot from requiring TPM on Linux as well we just don't necessarily have an answer
[3418.76 → 3425.72] to that yet they are not they are not enforcing this on Windows 10 which is interesting so windows
[3425.72 → 3429.56] 10 users are not locked out despite TPM 2.0 being launched years ago so they're saying they're good
[3429.56 → 3434.44] with people cheating as long as it's on Windows 10 and as long as it's only for the next four years or
[3434.44 → 3439.64] so at which point maybe they can consider dropping support for Windows 10. This is clearly a is
[3439.64 → 3447.64] clearly a moving forward um goal yeah but yeah it's its it's very interesting to me cheating
[3447.64 → 3456.12] in shooters is absolutely a very deep problem um for basically every shooter like it's its it's
[3456.12 → 3460.92] unfortunate, but it is that pervasive, so something has to be done I don't know if this is the
[3460.92 → 3466.20] necessarily solution that I would want but at this point in time if I wanted to be competitive in a shooter game
[3466.20 → 3474.44] um you'd support it basically maybe yeah just run a different operating system for the other things
[3474.44 → 3478.68] that you want to do I don't know have a different boot drive do something else but like utilize
[3479.48 → 3486.84] or that yeah like you can find some form of solution but um yeah there needs to be stronger
[3486.84 → 3493.00] enforcement, and it's very, very difficult to do that and I don't know how I would do it so I haven't
[3493.00 → 3498.20] necessarily thought of something better than this I mean some of the cheats are extremely difficult
[3498.20 → 3504.76] yeah there's I don't know how you would detect them because they're so close to operating as a human
[3504.76 → 3509.48] user would like they'll even go as far as to have it running on a separate machine separate computer
[3509.48 → 3517.56] then emulates mouse and keyboard inputs like just plugs into the gaming machine it's like okay how do
[3517.56 → 3522.92] you how do you those are crazy there's stuff too like this is I mean this is just
[3523.72 → 3528.84] major design issues but um there used to be a thing in Markov I've I've heard there's similar
[3528.84 → 3535.16] things going on still but I don't know if it's true um where you would have a completely different
[3535.16 → 3543.16] computer, and they would be able to sniff um like traffic for any lobby id, and you could check your
[3543.16 → 3548.60] lobby id while you're in the game so you would just select your lobby id, and then it would show you all
[3548.60 → 3553.96] the loot all the players where everyone was facing at every point in time so you could like to creep up on
[3553.96 → 3557.08] people and know if they were looking at you and everything, and it was running on a separate
[3557.08 → 3564.36] computer so like one of the ways that that streamers were getting caught was you see the streamer playing
[3564.36 → 3573.16] and doing this constantly but not interfacing with the chat, and they'd go like there's one in front of
[3573.16 → 3580.12] us right in the corner, and it was like okay come on, and they would just do it too many times and their
[3580.12 → 3585.64] audience would call them out um but like that's that's that's ridiculous right you can't catch that
[3585.64 → 3592.04] person um that that just I mean that has to be fixed yeah not if they're not streaming like there's
[3592.04 → 3598.36] there's no way to know yeah that has to be fixed at a design level but outside that um hey you're
[3598.36 → 3604.28] getting accused you're getting accused here twitch plays Dion says Luke sure do know a lot about hacks
[3604.28 → 3611.48] and cheating SUS yeah I'm uh you can check my records I'm not good enough for that, but that's um that's
[3611.48 → 3621.64] fair I would be doing better if I was cheating i I swear um but I mean it's it was so rampant in i
[3621.64 → 3626.04] don't know these days I haven't played Markov for a little bit now um I haven't been playing the new wipe but
[3626.92 → 3632.84] uh it was very rampant a while ago and this was like brought to light by a lot of the community
[3632.84 → 3639.56] there was a YouTube stream um it wasn't live we were able to figure that out pretty easily so they
[3639.56 → 3643.56] were trying to like to spoof it as live, but it wasn't live, but there was a YouTube stream that was
[3643.56 → 3653.16] basically just constantly up for a super long time um of someone running like Markov cheats just like
[3653.16 → 3657.40] killing entire lobbies and taking all their stuff over and over and over and over and over and over
[3657.40 → 3663.56] and over again it was crazy oh wow it was nuts um, and it happens in all these other games it's its
[3663.56 → 3669.96] just it's all over the shooter space so yeah work being done against that wow I'm getting wrecked down
[3669.96 → 3674.28] in the float plane chat true Scott says from Linus's last game of supreme commander I'm pretty
[3674.28 → 3679.64] sure he isn't cheating okay I was trying to host a video at the same time oh wait no that wasn't my
[3679.64 → 3684.92] last one okay all right I wasn't in the right headspace I wasn't in the right headspace i i i
[3684.92 → 3689.08] screwed that game up pretty bad it was pretty bad Linus is why was it subcom is a difficult game
[3690.28 → 3696.68] it was pretty bad pretty darn good at subcom no, no no, no no, no no I'm I'm I'm I'm fine I'm not good
[3696.68 → 3703.32] okay it okay in the community of people that still play supreme commander you might be fine
[3703.32 → 3710.36] um but if we threw like the entire lobby of everyone watching uh this show right now I bet
[3710.36 → 3716.20] you very few of them could beat you yeah, but that's just not understanding the gameplay mechanics like
[3716.20 → 3723.56] that I mean sort of it's an extremely complicated game it's more complicated than an average game but
[3723.56 → 3728.76] I would make the argument that a game like Team Fortress 2 is as complicated as supreme commander
[3732.36 → 3734.52] there is a lot of gameplay depth there
[3737.56 → 3747.08] there is lots and like it got to the point where is am supreme commander big nerd was like this is too
[3747.08 → 3752.52] complicated once they launched all the different weapons that people could have and all the different
[3752.52 → 3758.44] hats they could wear and I was just like yeah i I can't, I can't be constantly keeping up with
[3758.44 → 3766.12] whatever the new meta is like i I come in here to play this tightly balanced gaming experience because
[3766.12 → 3775.32] it was extremely well-balanced og tf2 is fantastic I still you know I still like playing some OG tf2 yeah
[3775.32 → 3783.32] yeah I wouldn't say okay blue sky says CS go is really complicated I wouldn't make the art i I would
[3783.32 → 3790.84] say that it's a different kind of complicated it's deep in the way that chess is deep, but you know
[3790.84 → 3798.44] fundamentally chess only has you know whatever it works out to six different pieces or seven different
[3798.44 → 3806.44] pieces, and they only move in a few ways what makes it deep is all the different ways based on what
[3806.44 → 3813.96] your opponent is doing that you can configure those moves it's its it's functionally infinite right um CS go
[3813.96 → 3821.56] is like that, but there's only you know a couple dozen guns you don't have to it's not like you have to mix
[3821.56 → 3826.12] and match the different like ammunitions that go in the guns like you would have to with something like Markov
[3826.12 → 3833.64] um you don't have to memorize you don't have to sit and like kind of memorize the rule book like it's a
[3833.64 → 3839.64] a fundamentally simple game but with unlimited depth so I'd say it's more like like a chess
[3839.64 → 3843.80] whereas I would compare something like tf2 with all the different weapons and all the different hats
[3843.80 → 3847.88] and all the different maps and all the different game modes it's its closer to something like a
[3847.88 → 3854.20] DND where you have to you basically have to study for two weeks to have any hope of
[3854.20 → 3860.04] recognizing the thing across the battlefield from you and having any idea what it might be trying to
[3860.04 → 3866.52] do does that kind of do you kind of follow me here does that make sense yeah i just I think with how
[3866.52 → 3873.24] the economy works and the varied build orders and the map strategy differences and stuff subcom is
[3874.04 → 3880.44] is quite, quite crazy I would say and this comes from someone who and someone in the chat just said and
[3880.44 → 3884.12] then there's eve I was going to say and this comes from someone who played eve for quite a while
[3884.12 → 3892.20] subcom's like its own beast now hold on a second hold on a second did tech ingredients just make a thermal
[3892.20 → 3892.60] paste
[3896.44 → 3903.64] I need to order this all right we're going to have to we're going to have to do this I'm messaging Alex right now
[3904.84 → 3909.24] okay we're going to review tech ingredients thermal paste man we're going to have to make sure we do it up
[3909.24 → 3914.36] right dang all right we got to get through some super chats and I think that's pretty much it for
[3914.36 → 3921.48] the show today uh frosty dog which broad term identifies anyone impacted by a business including
[3921.48 → 3935.72] but not limited to stockholders employer employees and customers um uh oh uh anyone impacted by a business
[3935.72 → 3939.00] I don't know what the way to do it is I don't know what the way to do it is I don't know oh, oh shoot oh no wait
[3939.00 → 3949.96] there's a really important news item uh where is it where's the link lttstore.com okay guys wait huh
[3951.80 → 3961.24] uh the page is broken uh nick hello okay there's a new product apparently the page is not up yet I will provide the
[3961.24 → 3971.00] link soon it is going to be the one and only or rather there will be 69 of them um, but we are doing
[3971.00 → 3978.76] a limited edition lanyard okay it is I believe it's the one that I'm using you guys might not have noticed
[3978.76 → 3988.36] but I don't just have the regular pink lanyard the text is actually in green thread so it's a Lamb edition
[3988.36 → 3997.56] only 70 of them were made the one in my pocket and 69 more it's going up on the store it's going to
[3997.56 → 4005.56] come with a limited edition uh sparkly Lamb sticker uh the link works now there you go here's where it is
[4005.56 → 4015.48] uh sparkly Lamb sticker and a certificate of authenticity okay these will be hand signed by yours truly
[4015.48 → 4020.92] uh this is number one of 69 I have a whole box of them here that maybe I'll do an after party stream
[4020.92 → 4025.24] or something like that I will sign them on stream so you guys will know it was actually by my hand
[4025.88 → 4031.72] they are 69 69 and you guys are probably going to want to move pretty fast if you want to get one
[4031.72 → 4039.96] because that's kind of how these things roll should we do this live Luke yes all right okay wait
[4039.96 → 4046.36] oh it's not under the regular lanyard skew so I don't even have the right page open hold on a second
[4046.36 → 4052.20] hold on a second control f Lamb all right well one of them's gone already someone managed to get
[4052.20 → 4059.16] through the cart already uh actually let's do some super chats let's do some super chats uh Arian
[4059.16 → 4068.28] says my budget is about a hundred more than one of them are gone oh are they uh six are gone
[4070.28 → 4079.24] okay uh Arian says my budget is a hundred thousand INR or 1360 USD any laptop a thousand USD in the US
[4079.24 → 4085.64] would cost 1300 okay my usage after effects with 300 timelines at the same time in war zone uh your
[4085.64 → 4090.60] best bet is going to be like a budget gaming laptop something like an uh how much is a Helios
[4093.88 → 4100.36] Helios 300 let me have a look here oh no the Helios is not what I was thinking of hold on a second
[4102.68 → 4107.40] man what's their um do you have any idea what acer's budget gaming laptop is
[4107.40 → 4113.96] uh Alex would know you know what you really need to do is you need to
[4115.08 → 4124.04] nitro oh it could be the nitro 5 yeah uh it's probably the nitro 5 okay here we go I'm gonna
[4124.04 → 4130.52] get you I'm going to get you that recommendation Brad okay I'm going to get you that recommendation uh core i5
[4130.52 → 4137.72] 9300h GTX uh 1650 that's quite a bit less than a thousand dollars though you could probably step up
[4138.44 → 4147.88] to man Lenovo legion has some really uh really performance stuff in that price range how much is
[4147.88 → 4157.72] the y540 you're you're getting hand selected tech tips okay man that one starts at 1200, but it really is a
[4157.72 → 4167.48] lot better um there is one lanyard available that's it there's one left okay well that went oh yep
[4168.52 → 4173.80] okay well uh see you later lanyards, and it's gone hey thanks for playing everyone
[4176.28 → 4184.76] okay our kabuki says any advice for a long-run HDMI 2.1 cable uh okay right so the y540 if you can afford
[4184.76 → 4189.88] its something like a nitro 5 if you don't want to go that ham um I'd say those are good
[4189.88 → 4197.48] starting points, and then you could find other ones kind of similar to that as well all right uh kabuki's
[4197.48 → 4203.64] long HDMI 2.0 run from a pc to a TV across the room I'm worried that directional fibre optic cables
[4203.64 → 4212.12] might lose features uh or something gamer specific that is a good question do active optical cables
[4212.12 → 4219.96] support things like variable refresh rate I would think so all you can really do is try it wow what
[4219.96 → 4226.52] it what an excellent wonderful question that now i kind of want to find the answer to maybe we should
[4226.52 → 4234.68] do like a short or something like that mans I don't remember the last time I got such an outstanding
[4234.68 → 4239.88] tech question from the audience that was just like holy crap that is something not only have we never made a
[4239.88 → 4248.92] video about i never even thought about optical cable directional var support question mark because
[4248.92 → 4254.20] the thing with active cables is that it's its not like a passive cable where you could have a HDMI 1.4
[4254.20 → 4260.60] certified cable and if it's just a short run it'll work fine at HDMI 2.0 or 2.1 speeds this is a totally
[4260.60 → 4266.92] different game uh MAL says hey Linus is there going to be a full review of the odyssey neo g9 just got mine it
[4266.92 → 4274.36] turns out HDR is totally broken hub have updated the review to do not buy really it was working for
[4274.36 → 4281.64] ours did they update something and break it uh okay looks like we've got another perfect request for video
[4284.92 → 4291.32] odyssey g9 revisit non-sponsored like we
[4291.32 → 4298.60] so we had some trouble uh with HDR when we did the sponsored video, but it was only because we had a
[4298.60 → 4305.40] second non-hero display connected and that caused some problems that as far as we can tell were the
[4305.40 → 4312.20] fault of windows not the fault of the monitor so I'm going to have to definitely have a look, and we'll see
[4312.20 → 4318.20] if that's maybe something that got broken by uh an update uh red wolf says hey I took your advice and
[4318.20 → 4321.88] took my 3080 back to micro centre they took it back after hearing about gigabytes and difference
[4321.88 → 4327.24] even though it was past the return date got a 3080 ti ftw3 ultra instead hey thank you hey no problem
[4327.24 → 4333.24] red wolf uh Florian says would you consider reviewing a VR haptic suit like the BH haptics
[4333.24 → 4339.72] vest and add-ons or is that too niche I would love to know if and which parts are worth it man it's not
[4339.72 → 4346.76] really our it's not really our jam but uh I mean you asked so nicely and you did send me 20 euros I'll
[4346.76 → 4352.52] I'll at least consider it I'm putting this in the list which also known as an email to myself
[4353.00 → 4360.68] VR haptic suit review uh all right okay wow it looks like half the super chats are just
[4360.68 → 4366.12] kind of questions and stuff like that uh spaceman says hey thanks for telling me to switch from at
[4366.12 → 4371.80] bank to rack mount as a thank-you we have named our 20 bay monster Anthony decided by poll hey nice
[4371.80 → 4379.64] uh pierce says want to buy a Ferrari wheel and build a pc in it also do you know anyone who needs
[4379.64 → 4386.28] who just who needs just one Ferrari wheel like the like a wheel like from a car not like a
[4386.28 → 4392.76] racing wheel like uh an actual wheel um I don't think so I think I'm good you should get them to send
[4392.76 → 4398.84] it to you, and you should build a Ferrari wheel pc um it's been done there's been some wheel pcs done
[4398.84 → 4405.00] before but one from an actual Ferrari could be kind of cool angels 000 asks when will the LTT
[4405.00 → 4410.52] screwdriver be released we are hoping we will hit this calendar year uh we've solved most of the
[4410.52 → 4418.36] problems, and we are almost ready to go uh into mass production I'm really excited also how did you get
[4418.36 → 4425.48] connected to Hassan piker for his uh build uh just saw he was building and messaged um seems like a cool
[4425.48 → 4431.16] dude so yeah we're we're going to get working on that I should have a writer assigned to it next week
[4434.44 → 4441.32] uh let's see here administrator says hello dear Linus my deer balls itch and I've used many creams to
[4441.32 → 4447.08] take care of the issue will you ever provide a product at LTT that can resolve this um one of these
[4447.08 → 4452.60] days I think we're planning to do an unboxing knife I think you could probably use that to cut them off
[4452.60 → 4459.08] that would solve the problem, but it would also create new problems so you let me know if uh that's
[4459.08 → 4466.92] what you're into administrator did you know that lewis Grossman made a framework video no I didn't
[4467.56 → 4472.84] he did oh what did uh lewis have to say about it, he made it in February
[4472.84 → 4484.12] um the title sounds like it's going to be really negative um oh but I guess it was pretty positive
[4484.12 → 4490.44] the like to dislike ratio on the video was really high framework responded um with some perfect
[4490.44 → 4496.84] responses he responded to framework with this is a response to their response number one this is
[4496.84 → 4502.20] beautiful number two this is amazing number three this is great number four just some questions
[4502.20 → 4506.68] number five this is fine number six this is beautiful so he seems very happy which is good
[4508.04 → 4513.88] oh well that's great uh lewis's endorsement means a lot to me and actually I wouldn't watch the whole
[4513.88 → 4520.04] video it looks like happy with their responses I don't know three videos, so there's another one a month
[4520.04 → 4529.32] ago um and another one streamed yesterday uh with actual hands-on with it, I guess I found the wrong one
[4529.32 → 4536.68] that is awesome and I fix it gave it a 10 out of 10 um for their teardown so guys I shot today
[4536.68 → 4544.04] the video announcing that I did go ahead with my investment in framework and I'm not going to spoil
[4544.04 → 4547.48] everything it's actually a perfect video you guys should definitely watch it
[4547.48 → 4554.28] uh but I will tell you guys one thing that comes right at the end of the video and that's really
[4555.08 → 4563.48] important to me and was a pivotal part of making this decision uh let me see if I can find it
[4565.08 → 4571.64] here you put up a lot of content recently this is from this is from the founder uh, and he says and
[4571.64 → 4578.28] this is the exact words we do promise not to up from a pro consumer and pro environment perspective
[4578.28 → 4583.40] and you would be fully justified in holding us to the fire if we break that promise whether
[4583.40 → 4590.60] you invest so what I have committed at the end of that video is that among other things really it's a
[4590.60 → 4598.12] great video go watch it um what I've committed is that if they fall off this pro consumer pro environment
[4598.12 → 4606.52] path uh my mess-up with them my mess-up my breakup with them will be public messy and absolute so
[4607.48 → 4614.20] um that's my commitment to you guys uh so far they seem to be taking their mission extremely seriously
[4614.20 → 4622.84] and I'm really excited to have a front seat uh on this crazy ride uh wan Chong says would you
[4622.84 → 4629.40] consider revisiting the used graphics card testing to include real industry standard lifetime conditioning
[4630.44 → 4636.28] yes who should I reach out to with more info uh you should reach out to the publicly available email
[4636.28 → 4643.08] on the YouTube channel we do monitor that I don't, but someone does uh Mr creator says do you
[4643.08 → 4649.40] mother lovers sell any LTT merch locally I want to be a LTT shill but I'm too impulsive for ship times
[4649.40 → 4655.24] we've considered doing pop-ups, but that was something we were just starting to look into in
[4655.24 → 4664.04] the months leading up to well covid and like getting big crowds of people together in person hasn't really
[4664.04 → 4670.52] been a thing for the last 18 months so um you know yeah yeah yeah we've considered it but
[4670.52 → 4679.48] it's not something that is on the roadmap right now uh josh says lewis is super stoked about
[4679.48 → 4683.80] the framework you should check his new community posts I would expect that he would be they seem
[4683.80 → 4691.96] to be taking it extremely seriously I like oh man I'm not going to buy one because I'm too cheap and I have
[4691.96 → 4696.36] a laptop that works but this has been probably one of the most tempting
[4696.36 → 4704.36] tech releases in a long time for me to personally buy because the like hardware nerd in me just wants
[4704.36 → 4711.32] one because they're so cool like and I'm to be very transparent Linus is talking to you guys about
[4711.32 → 4716.52] investment I have no skin in this game at all there 's's no reason for me to care outside of it just
[4716.52 → 4724.44] being really cool yep um and if it is it genuinely just seems really cool I am going to watch this entire
[4724.44 → 4731.40] hour long lewis Grossman video just because it's exciting i this is such a cool moment in
[4731.40 → 4736.28] computing and i really really really hope that it works long term because this would be this would
[4736.28 → 4741.64] be awesome if I do buy another laptop as of right now I don't know it could change but as of right now
[4741.64 → 4751.24] it would be this guaranteed and I think that's it for the show today thank you so much for tuning in guys
[4751.24 → 4758.52] thank you to everyone who uh got themselves a Lamb edition lanyard along with the sticker and
[4758.52 → 4767.48] certificate of authenticity um 69 of you placed orders and will presumably proudly rock your Lamb
[4767.48 → 4774.68] edition lanyard uh for many years because these things never break i finally in order to switch to the
[4774.68 → 4781.00] pink one I ditched my black one but not because it was anywhere near showing any signs of giving up
[4781.00 → 4788.92] whatsoever I love these lanyards they're awesome okay I think we're just going to roll that outro and bye
[4788.92 → 4793.00] bye guys bye
[4793.00 → 4817.00] oh I guess I owe them a stream later so uh yeah give me a bit of time though probably I don't know you owe them a stream later yeah because I got a sign all these two oh
[4817.00 → 4819.00] oh
