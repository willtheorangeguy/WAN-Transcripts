You are aware that you need a 0:00 timestamp in the description for it to show on the timeline right?

Responding to Timestamp 35:31.  Small businesses are much better at customer service than big companies like Amazon. And then people say well let's have more diversity and they try this horrible stuff like taxing and other crap that does not ever affect Amazon or other big companies but absolutely destroys other small businesses. Same for wage...big companies can handle wage increases, but when applied to Small businesses it destroys them. And when (liberal in particular (not all though) politicians say that they "support small business" and then they go and increase taxes on the business, as well as wage, means that they are outright lying because increasing taxes and wage just hurts the business which then they have to lay people off and then the economy suffers. You are a small business and should take this into consideration next time you vote.

After hearing about the new channel and why it's going to be run a certain way for 26 minutes I'm closing the video. I look forward to the timestamps being added so I can see tech news.

But again....timestamps you Jesus sandel. It's not hard and doesn't cost you that much to pay someone 2 extra hours.

It's live Linus...we know that. However why can't you or one of your 30+ employees put timestamps in after it ends? Most of us have lives and can't catch it live. And before you make a sad excuse Steve from GN does timestamps with less than 10 employees.
