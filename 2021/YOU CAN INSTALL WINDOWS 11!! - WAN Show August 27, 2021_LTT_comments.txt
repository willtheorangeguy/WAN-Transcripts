Hey everyone! So earlier, I tried to pin the link to the Live Audio Room that Linus hosted with Wendell about Linux, but it doesn't seem like it worked. So the only way for you to listen is to use Facebook's app and head to the Linustech Facebook page, as you'll find the post at the top. 

It's a bit of a pain, but the whole feature is still in Alpha! We have raised the issue with Facebook's team associated with the project.
