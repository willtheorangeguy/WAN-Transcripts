[0.00 → 10.92] Welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you today because
[10.92 → 19.04] boy is it ever easier to have a fun and exciting WAN show when we've got news like this week the
[19.04 → 27.42] valve the valve steam deck is the hot right now and everyone's talking about it and why not because
[27.42 → 34.52] this thing is flipping excited so we're going to dig into that we're also going to be talking about TSMC
[34.52 → 41.88] exploring on chip water cooling this is something enthusiasts have explored at times in the past but
[41.88 → 48.98] it's certainly to my knowledge never been looked at by someone as important and as actually capable
[48.98 → 57.30] of pulling it off as TSMC what else we got uh Alder Lake is hopefully going to be not terrible
[57.30 → 65.56] which would be absolutely fantastic um and Microsoft announces Windows 365 just in case you want
[65.56 → 70.38] another subscription service there you go problem solved did they really I actually didn't see this
[70.38 → 75.74] yes it's probably not exactly what you think so stay tuned, and we'll talk more about it later okay then
[75.74 → 85.16] it's like remote testing stuff it's actually like maybe kind of cool all right
[85.16 → 104.86] and the show is brought to you today by pulse way ridge wallet and oops I clicked the oh yeah
[104.86 → 110.42] Squarespace yes that's definitely right okay cool so why don't we jump right into our headline topic
[110.42 → 117.98] the valve steam deck and I want to start with what is going to be my harshest criticism of this new
[117.98 → 123.36] hardware endeavour from valve yes okay all right this is my hot take this is the worst thing about it
[123.36 → 132.46] the name sucks its terrible it's terrible it's terrible the stream deck has existed for years yes
[132.46 → 141.14] for years the legato stream deck which is even a gaming device for years it's existed it's been in the
[141.14 → 148.70] market, and it's the only thing that kind of sounds like that like is external to the computer and
[148.70 → 152.02] technically has screens on it and is flat and is black
[152.02 → 163.46] why just like even more annoying why deck yeah that's who like what I don't know I understand
[163.46 → 172.06] the stream deck that actually does make sense to me steam deck no steam boy I'd have been like lol
[172.06 → 178.84] okay and Nintendo's coming for you, you know Nintendo would be coming for him yeah steam okay so here
[178.84 → 183.22] fine it's not helpful to criticize something unless you come up with something better so Luke we got to
[183.22 → 190.16] work on this then, so Steve there's been a pretty good one there's been two there's one that I like more
[190.16 → 195.90] that to get the community ones first before we try to come up with things hit me um there 's's one in
[195.90 → 204.00] the doc that calls it I mean it's called the Gabe boy there's the Gabe boy advanced and Gabe boy
[204.00 → 211.16] advanced SP that one's funny I believe that was that by Anthony contributed a very large
[211.16 → 215.64] amount of topics this week so we only really have a doc because of Anthony so thank you, Anthony
[215.64 → 222.18] very funny but the other I agree that wasn't sarcastic that was actually I know it could probably
[222.18 → 226.56] sound that way, but it wasn't we would have like two topics if it wasn't for Anthony he actually
[226.56 → 232.20] completely bailed us out thank you very much um but the other community one which I do think is
[232.20 → 240.54] is better is Gabe gear no, no you can't have Gabe's name in the name of the thing like I have no problem
[240.54 → 250.38] with them calling it steam something you know steam pad or steam I don't know steam I mean like
[250.38 → 255.12] you know what's something kind of like deck is too close to stream deck that's all that's like that's
[255.12 → 260.30] the just that's just the main problem, and it's not an unheard of device a lot of people know the
[260.30 → 265.76] stream deck so it's like just annoying honestly when I first read the name I thought it was called
[265.76 → 270.94] stream deck and I thought they just straighten up completely ripped off the name from Plato because
[270.94 → 278.54] it's not like valve doesn't have a streaming service well that was my whole thought was like yeah okay so
[278.54 → 283.82] this is to remotely play games from your desktop using valve right like steam and home streaming which I
[283.82 → 288.64] don't know what they call it any remote play is it no, no remote play is when you're playing a local
[288.64 → 291.96] multiplayer game with someone remotely sorry I can't keep track of all the different things they
[291.96 → 298.08] call stuff the point is so should we really call it steam deck I have I'm frustrated the good news
[298.08 → 305.58] is that everything else about this thing looks absolutely freaking awesome lets uh let's haul up
[305.58 → 310.30] the product page here I mean I even typed stream deck while I was trying to search for it
[310.30 → 315.68] bloody hell okay it's yeah yeah your mind immediately goes to stream deck it's a problem
[315.68 → 321.98] oh uh that's uh not the screen capture that I wanted what happened to my oh no here we go that's
[321.98 → 329.42] better steam deck here it is ladies and gentlemen so one thing before you get too far into it yes um
[329.42 → 335.70] can they see the layout of it on your screen right now uh the layout of the of like the pc
[335.70 → 342.56] of the steam deck yeah ignore the pricing guys I'm stuck on the Canadian site and I can't immediately
[342.56 → 348.36] figure out how to change it, so this is Canadian pricing uh so whatever
[348.36 → 357.16] so my favourite thing if they can see it yeah is that it more closely resembles a Wii U game pad
[357.16 → 363.92] and most other things I have seen so far and the Wii U game pad was actually a delight to use it was
[363.92 → 369.16] fantastic I actually preferred it over the standard controllers it was really nice and one of the things
[369.16 → 374.12] with that is that the thumb sticks are at the top okay you're getting into nitty-gritty details here
[374.12 → 381.04] but we got to give people the general lowdown okay Luke we got to give them the lowdown so here's the
[381.04 → 388.12] basic specs it's got a seven-inch display it's touchscreen it's 1280 by 800 so that's a 16 by 10
[388.12 → 393.66] aspect ratio 400 nits typical brightness it's got an ambient light sensor so that's going to help you
[393.66 → 400.24] conserve battery if you're in a dim area or whatever the case may be it's got a zen 2 APU four cores eight
[400.24 → 406.70] threads running it anywhere from well up to 3.5 gigahertz boost and up to 15 watts TDP it's got an
[406.70 → 414.52] eight it's got eight rdna2 us that run it up to 1.6 gigahertz, so this thing is actually going to be
[414.52 → 422.66] capable of running triple a games now not triple a games at 4k resolution in dock mode or anything
[422.66 → 428.76] stupid like that it's still you know of this earth it's not like they went to the future and
[428.76 → 435.82] brought back technology with them, but it is going to have some serious grunt considering its size it
[435.82 → 447.66] weighs 1.47 pounds so that's uh just under 700 grams 669 grams um which is pretty beefy and maybe this
[447.66 → 453.28] some engineer must have pulled off a couple grams there to make that work that I swear
[453.28 → 460.98] that i I wouldn't put it past them, but this is I think this is the first time that this is where we
[460.98 → 464.52] can get into a little bit of a deeper dive conversation one of the things that you
[464.52 → 473.06] immediately said was wow this reminds me of the Wii U game pad controller unfortunately this thing weighs
[473.06 → 479.96] 67 percent more than a Nintendo Switch plus joy cons and considering that the Wii U controller was
[479.96 → 487.58] just a screen and buttons and wireless yeah it was extremely light that's one of the reasons that
[487.58 → 493.60] the Wii U controller was so comfortable it was also thick because it wasn't designed to be carried out
[493.60 → 500.44] and about with you the strips the steam deck is obviously thinner and is going for something more
[500.44 → 506.90] akin to a Nintendo Switch type of experience so that's something that is immediately going to be
[506.90 → 513.88] tough but I also have I also have a counterargument to that I'll get into a little bit
[513.88 → 521.46] later that involves this guy right here my main note about the Wii U controller is the way that this
[521.46 → 525.30] shoulder button and I'm not saying this hasn't been done before by any alternatives which is I think
[525.30 → 532.26] what you're kind of getting into but the way that the where you hold it is shaped the way the
[532.26 → 541.14] triggers are shaped those grip position of the thumb sticks and the Abby uh buttons that is all very
[541.14 → 545.86] nice my one of my biggest issues with the switch was that they put that one thumb stick in like the
[545.86 → 552.26] middle of the controller yeah, and it made it really weird um and I really liked that the Wii U had both
[552.26 → 557.22] the thumb sticks way at the top, and it was kind of less great that the Abby was below it but you almost
[557.22 → 561.30] never used that so it didn't matter and I think it's pretty cool on this one how they're side by side i
[561.30 → 566.26] don't think that's going to be uncomfortable to control with smaller hands for small hands I have some
[566.26 → 571.46] concerns like if my kids tried to use this thing I don't for my hands it looks okay but if like my kids
[571.46 → 576.10] tried to use it or something like that I think it might be a little bit more challenging right it
[576.10 → 583.06] looks pretty darn well-thought-out and valve has a history of thinking through the ergonomics of things
[583.06 → 587.70] at least to the point where you can definitely go well they definitely thought this through I mean
[587.70 → 592.50] the uh the steam controller bloody hell what they call that thing did they just call it steam control
[592.50 → 600.02] they did the steam controller was ergonomic it's just that the touchpad didn't really work for me
[600.02 → 604.98] what's fascinating about this is that they clearly haven't abandoned the touchpad paradigm they just
[604.98 → 611.22] have recognized now that it's not perfect for everything they had us using the touchpad instead
[611.22 → 618.90] of joysticks whereas here now we've got a touchpad well actually rather touchpads in addition to
[618.90 → 625.30] joysticks which opens up all kinds of options both for ambidextrous players or left-handed players as well
[625.30 → 631.14] as for different gameplay styles like or different genres of games that you might want to play that's
[631.14 → 639.94] that's extremely exciting and I'm I am really I'm stoked to try it now it's got 16 gigs of LP ddr5 memory
[640.50 → 647.70] it's got a 40 watt-hour battery that is extremely impressive considering the size of this thing stereo
[647.70 → 653.62] speakers analog triggers which is a big deal that's one of my complaints about the thing that I was going to
[653.62 → 661.30] talk about a little bit later a micro SD card up to 512 gigs of m.2 storage on board depending on which
[661.30 → 668.66] uh trim level you spring for and these twin 32 and a half millimetre touchpads claim that they have 55
[668.66 → 673.62] better latency compared to the steam controllers touchpads they are pressure sensitive and have HD
[673.62 → 680.02] haptics uh so that's just improved feedback on the touchpads when you're swiping across them pressing on
[680.02 → 689.78] them all that kind of stuff man six axis motion sensitivity okay that's pretty cool uh we did a
[689.78 → 696.90] video recently where I tried using the PlayStation 4 controllers uh gyro capabilities to game on pc
[696.90 → 703.86] there's like a hacky way that you could do it and I was shocked at how intuitive it was compared to
[703.86 → 709.86] to trying to yeah trying to fine tune operate a joystick there's pro gamers out there that are
[709.86 → 714.26] great at it that's that's fine that's great that's wonderful but for someone who hasn't spent their
[714.26 → 720.50] whole life working on that skill boy is a gyro I think there's going to be some advanced tactic
[720.50 → 724.82] stuff too where you do a combination use the thumb stick for like big sweeping movements than you
[724.82 → 729.30] micro adjust with the aiming but i I think there's something that wasn't mentioned here or maybe I missed
[729.30 → 734.50] it maybe you said it and I didn't hear it, but there's also the grip buttons on the back which
[735.14 → 739.86] I really like especially like it's always been really cool in the elite controllers and stuff but
[739.86 → 744.98] I think on this it makes even more sense because like I was talking about earlier all your controls
[744.98 → 749.86] being at the top the thumb sticks being in probably the best position which is the outside if I'm I think
[749.86 → 755.78] I'm correct with that the inside sorry um yeah the outside is a little maybe a little weird but um having
[755.78 → 760.98] those buttons on the back is going to make it so you don't have to move off which on a heavy device
[760.98 → 765.14] I think is going to actually be a pretty big deal yep you'll be able to keep your hands in one spot
[765.14 → 769.30] and be able to press buttons there I think it's going to be a much bigger deal than it's ever been
[769.30 → 774.74] on a controller I think it's going to be very, very important on this device absolutely uh it's got two
[774.74 → 783.78] by two ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 5.0 a dual microphone array it can output 8k 60 uh because it's got display port
[783.78 → 790.82] 1.4 built into its USB type c port, and you can also use the USB port to connect to the official
[790.82 → 796.82] dock yes that's right ladies and gentlemen there's a dock too uh it'll be sold separately more
[796.82 → 804.02] information coming soon, but it's got display port HDMI uh type c as well as that looks like a audio
[804.02 → 808.90] jack hold on a second it's in my notes uh but up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up
[808.90 → 816.42] USB 3.1 type an uh so two of those effectively it turns this into a full desktop pc experience
[816.42 → 824.58] there's Ethernet and so there's one usb3 two uses sorry I think I misspoke earlier I don't see
[825.70 → 830.18] that's probably power that's probably power over on the left there because I would expect you to handle
[830.18 → 839.70] audio uh just plugging into the jack that's built into the steam deck itself man i I hope they get
[839.70 → 848.26] the joysticks right I mean it seems like everyone and their dog is going through joystick gate right
[848.26 → 853.86] now whether it's Nintendo with their drift or whether it's Sony that's had a real heck of a time with
[853.86 → 858.90] feedback on their PlayStation 5 controllers which is otherwise freaking awesome to the point where
[858.90 → 864.10] Microsoft is reportedly looking at doing a mid-generation refresh of their controller to try
[864.10 → 872.74] and achieve something closer to feature parity um I hope valve gets it just right on this thing but
[872.74 → 879.38] the reality of it is that it's extremely challenging to build both an accurate and robust joystick in
[879.38 → 884.90] something that is so low profile I understand why everyone's screwing it up even companies that have
[884.90 → 892.90] a ton of experience I just don't like it because joysticks not working sucks yes absolutely sucks
[893.46 → 897.06] if there's is there's anything that's going to make you want to put a game down that's that's
[897.06 → 903.22] definitely one of them three different trim levels okay the base model is and this is absolutely
[903.86 → 909.78] mind-blowing to me the base model is 399 us I just saw a comment on float plane saying they need to
[909.78 → 915.78] drop the price a hundred dollars in order to make this thing attractive are you kidding me this is a
[915.78 → 925.62] full computer for 400 this is basically in a chip shortage this is Chromebook level pricing almost
[926.50 → 932.90] except that it's got a built-in what I'm assuming is high quality controller and it's going to be a
[932.90 → 939.62] relatively non-mainstream product I mean maybe uh gay man also came out and said they're expecting to sell
[939.62 → 946.02] quote millions of these things but man this is an engineering challenge to build these things
[946.58 → 952.26] you know valve's got to make some money I mean there's somebody in the chat saying rich guy view
[952.90 → 959.14] rich guy view what are you talking about I feel like I often don't take the rich guy view and I would say
[959.14 → 966.58] if you expect that to be 2.99 you're out to freaking lunch um it's its it's not that there 's's
[966.58 → 974.02] like it's just it's just wishful thinking um and sure you could say oh I really want this to be a
[974.02 → 980.10] hundred dollars because I'd love for it to be five yeah sure I'd love for it to be I'd love for it to be
[980.10 → 985.30] 50 cents you know i just yeah maybe I could just maybe I could just wish on a star and one would fall into
[985.30 → 993.30] my lap but you got to understand these things actually cost money do you have any idea how much
[993.30 → 998.58] the tooling for this device would have cost I mean we're talking valve was out seven figures before
[998.58 → 1004.90] they even put any computer hardware and even built one just to do the plastics for it like you have to
[1004.90 → 1010.98] understand that right no not that low but a hundred dollars yes yeah but you're still just
[1010.98 → 1014.98] holding that out of your butt like this that's coming out of nowhere for the stuff that's in this
[1014.98 → 1019.86] especially during a chip shortage this is not an egregious price and I would love to say it is but
[1019.86 → 1024.42] it's its just not let's ignore the chip shortage because by the time this thing ships um you know
[1024.42 → 1027.94] looking at what's happening with GPU pricing in China we're going to talk about that a little bit
[1027.94 → 1033.94] later on the show who knows maybe it's the elite the chip shortage will be alleviated somewhat but
[1033.94 → 1039.38] let's look at what else is on the market into manufacturing now because you can't just look at a
[1039.38 → 1044.74] product in a vacuum right you can't just say well it's more expensive than I would like therefore it
[1044.74 → 1051.38] should be cheaper everything has a cost and everything has to compete with what else is available in the
[1051.38 → 1058.66] market so let's look at what else is available in the market there's the Nintendo Switch which is 299 us
[1059.22 → 1068.26] for a flipping four-year-old armed CPU with a Terra GPR excuse me a Terra SOC with an arm CPU and what
[1068.26 → 1081.22] is it like maxwell GPU on it uh Terra x1 is it maxwell I think it is yeah I mean we are talking ancient
[1081.22 → 1089.30] technology that wasn't cutting edge when the switch came out four years ago Nintendo wants 299 for that
[1090.18 → 1096.18] okay now let's look at something that's way more comparable the a and neo which is the handheld that
[1096.18 → 1102.82] I've been holding up that is I think probably the most comparable thing to the steam deck on the market
[1102.82 → 1109.06] right now a thing is barely even on the market so far they've only done a kickstarter
[1109.06 → 1115.30] excuse me Indiegogo campaign for it so I don't even think you can just buy one and have it
[1115.30 → 1123.22] ship immediately and now let's have a look at the pricing okay this by this guy starts at uh hold on
[1123.22 → 1130.98] a second here we go it was 880 Canadian dollars so that's around 700 us dollars that sound like a
[1130.98 → 1137.14] reasonable price but let's drop it by 100 bucks sorry I keep going at 100 no sorry, sorry it was a
[1137.14 → 1144.74] joke based on the comment okay that's 300 higher with what is essentially very similar hardware okay
[1144.74 → 1149.46] not quite 300 higher because we're comparing it to the base model so let's go back to the
[1150.10 → 1154.26] that's pretty good though yeah I do want to jump in there so the so yeah I'm just going to go
[1154.26 → 1160.98] through the model stuff quickly the base model is 399 us it has 64 gigs of eMMC flash storage um and
[1160.98 → 1166.66] that's that's it you're just getting the device that's it if you go up to the 529 us model you get
[1166.66 → 1173.46] 256 gigs of storage you get a carrying case and you get a steam community profile whatever might as
[1173.46 → 1182.90] well if you go up a bit more about 120 bucks to 649 us you go up to 512 gigs of NVMe storage
[1183.78 → 1188.98] you get an exclusive carrying case you get an exclusive steam community profile and you get an
[1188.98 → 1199.22] exclusive virtual keyboard theme whatever something to note yeah those NVMe drives replaceable yep so
[1199.22 → 1204.10] they're 30 millimetre 30 millimetre NVMe drives this is where we get into the comparisons with the a
[1204.10 → 1213.86] neo a little bit so the neo at its cheapest early bird price was 50 more than the comparably equipped
[1213.86 → 1218.66] steam deck there was a problem with the notes sorry there's a problem with the notes the base model
[1218.66 → 1225.14] does include a carrying case the main difference on these two yeah sorry sorry sorry
[1225.14 → 1233.14] the main difference is that you go from 64 gigs of eMMC to 256 gigs of NVMe just straight up
[1233.14 → 1238.10] so it's its faster storage more storage not a carrying case thing and you get the community
[1238.10 → 1244.26] profile sorry continue okay so back to the neo a little bit let's talk some let's talk some
[1244.26 → 1251.38] pros and cons uh one of the things the neo has is it's got way more USB expansion so it's got two USB
[1251.38 → 1258.90] ports on the top that is flipping awesome uh it's got two more CPU cores okay it's got uh so it's got a
[1258.90 → 1266.74] dozen 5 4500u that is a six core processor it's got uh let me have a look here what other sort of
[1266.74 → 1271.94] advantages it I mean I don't know if this one is actually making its way into the public's
[1271.94 → 1277.22] hands but it has like built-in RGB lighting which I guess is kind of cool in the dark so you can see
[1277.22 → 1280.74] these green lights on the side I believe they can be configured they're breathing right now
[1281.70 → 1288.34] um what's the size of the battery I think it actually says right on the back here 47 watt-hours
[1288.34 → 1293.30] so I think that's actually a little less if I recall correctly no it's actually a little bit more so it
[1293.30 → 1300.74] has a slightly bigger battery uh it takes full-sized 80 millimetre NVMe uh drives so that's pretty cool as
[1300.74 → 1307.78] well but it doesn't have six axis uh motion controls uh it doesn't have the touchpads um
[1308.98 → 1317.86] I haven't seen valve screen yet but i I suspect the one on the uh the one on the steam I keep
[1317.86 → 1322.90] playing we'll come wanting to call it a steam pad now the one on the steam deck is probably going to
[1322.90 → 1328.66] be a little bit better this one is this one is pretty good they're both seven inches the point is these
[1328.66 → 1333.94] are fairly comparable devices oh the speakers are pretty bad on this thing to the point where
[1333.94 → 1341.62] apparently they're they're still tuning those now um and it's 50 more at the cheapest early bird price
[1342.34 → 1351.70] and then this thing was 789 and they sold 500 out of 500 of them this is a campaign that did two point
[1351.70 → 1361.62] like to like 2.2 2.3 million us dollars and to this day you cannot buy this thing because it is out of
[1361.62 → 1373.22] stock okay so you can say oh yeah valve is charging too much or whatever but if anything by offering that
[1373.22 → 1381.30] 64 gig eMMC option with micro SD expansion they have clearly done everything in their power to make
[1381.30 → 1389.94] this thing as affordable as possible this is not some cheapos arm SOC this is a full-fledged pc
[1391.86 → 1396.82] it's freaking awesome and I'm not some kind of valve fanboy I have no problem calling them out when
[1396.82 → 1402.74] they do something stupid, but you got to understand that you got to give credit where credit is due
[1402.74 → 1409.38] this hardware has a cost developing hardware has a cost, and we can't expect valve to just
[1411.06 → 1416.66] give it away at a loss like I don't they're a for-profit company what do you guys want I'm I'm
[1416.66 → 1422.82] excited to get my hands on this thing and I think it's going to be a dinner beef and float plane chat
[1422.82 → 1428.74] says Gabe said hitting that price was not easy I believe him oh yeah definitely yeah if the plastics
[1428.74 → 1433.70] quality of this thing not to mention just the cost of getting them all assembled like there's a
[1433.70 → 1438.66] production cost of these things if it's anywhere near what I would expect from valve based on my other
[1438.66 → 1446.82] valve hardware this thing would have cost a freaking fortune to PR to create now angry panda pc over
[1446.82 → 1450.74] in float plane chat says the price to value debate doesn't make any sense on this device
[1450.74 → 1455.46] and I criticize so many modern devices for being overpriced actually no I have no idea what you're
[1455.46 → 1462.90] talking about so values in the eye of the beholder you can say it's not worth it to me absolutely
[1463.54 → 1467.86] that is a hundred percent I think this is going to be not worth it to a lot of people of course
[1467.86 → 1474.98] not that's okay that's fine it's just not yeah not everything has to be for everyone value is in the
[1474.98 → 1484.90] eye of the beholder, but the price is aggressive Jr 69 55 says PSV to MSRP 249 you have to understand
[1485.46 → 1490.18] like sorry what are you talking about that's the hundred dollar guy just don't just oh is it
[1490.18 → 1500.26] really oh okay yeah yeah you're good don't worry about that uh, uh wow okay an official doc is going to be
[1500.26 → 1505.78] sold separately this is actually super we talked about that oh sorry yeah I hope there's uh unofficial
[1505.78 → 1510.58] ones as well one thing that's kind of stupid about the official doc and about the device actually I'm
[1510.58 → 1516.58] not a huge fan of this I saw some praise for it for having its USB charging port on the top
[1516.58 → 1523.14] because they said it'll make it easier to game while you're charging um yeah I can see that because
[1523.14 → 1527.30] especially with a heavy device like this one this weighs about the same amount sometimes I do find
[1527.30 → 1533.54] myself wanting to rest it but I also don't mind resting it kind of like this with my wrists making
[1533.54 → 1539.46] it so that the cable can get out and having something hanging off the top I'm not a huge fan
[1539.46 → 1544.98] of that especially if it's kind of a bulkier wire, and it also makes the dock kind of stupid because
[1544.98 → 1550.82] their dock requires you to put the thing in and then run a cable so it's not really a dock so much as
[1550.82 → 1555.70] it's a dongle you might have already said this considering you already mentioned the dock but
[1555.70 → 1563.38] uh they also said that regular USB adapters will work fine um all I doubt actually all but they
[1563.38 → 1570.98] said all USB docks will work so I mean I see no reason why one wouldn't uh yeah i just you know
[1571.86 → 1577.62] I don't know a hazard to say just like literally anything will function yeah that's fair yeah all
[1577.62 → 1581.46] right but I don't suspect you're going to run into issues is what I'm trying to get across great
[1581.46 → 1585.54] Hershey chap over on float plane says it would be cool if Linux was on the steam deck kind of like
[1585.54 → 1593.70] steam machines hey I'm so glad you uh brought it up because yes it is running steam OS what is it
[1593.70 → 1603.86] steam OS 3.0 uh hold on blah blah blah oh where's my notes yep steam OS 3.0 which is arch Linux based
[1603.86 → 1609.30] uh it's got um let's see hold on there's some perfect information in here
[1609.30 → 1616.82] yes now obviously because it's Linux you're going to have some issues with game compatibilities
[1616.82 → 1622.50] particularly games with strong anti-cheat, so there are a handful of games including shoot which
[1622.50 → 1627.70] one was I I was looking at a list of them before this and now I've gone and misplaced it uh but four
[1627.70 → 1635.46] of the top 10 games on steam right now have issues with anti-cheat in uh in Linux uh running valve's
[1635.46 → 1641.06] proton, but valve is apparently reaching out to those developers and trying to work specifically
[1641.06 → 1647.22] on those games to make sure that proton which is a compatibility layer that allows you to run windows
[1647.22 → 1656.58] games on Linux will have proper support for those i am pretty excited so if you ever is you ever
[1656.58 → 1661.94] end up in a Linux debate or Linux conversation in general after owning one of these you can confidently say
[1661.94 → 1670.34] that you run arch I know right, so their goal is for every game to work with proton by the time
[1670.34 → 1674.74] they ship steam deck that should give you some idea of how long this has been in the works what
[1674.74 → 1680.58] it seems like is they basically tried that whole steam machines thing which was like the desktop
[1680.58 → 1687.62] or rather the TV consoles uh kind of went okay yeah this didn't work we didn't do the whole killer app
[1687.62 → 1695.06] thing um also it's just a computer it's hard to compete against just computers uh forget it see you
[1695.06 → 1702.42] later that project clearly never died it looks like it just transitioned to a handheld and the timing is
[1702.42 → 1709.46] so right for this to happen I mean we've watched it happen smaller companies like God have been bringing
[1709.46 → 1716.18] out devices like this for years now, and they've always been pretty okay but this last generation I was
[1716.18 → 1723.14] extremely bullish on the God win 3 uh we covered the neo founder we covered the oh man what's that
[1723.14 → 1729.62] thing called the one x player all three of them were like pretty cool and had their pros and cons
[1729.62 → 1734.98] uh the one x player screen resolution was too high you couldn't drive it honestly it was too big at
[1734.98 → 1743.78] what was it like almost nine inches died 8.4 inches uh kind of too bulky um the God win 3 great a little
[1743.78 → 1747.94] bit hampered by its xc graphics honestly not because the performance sucks but because the
[1747.94 → 1753.46] drivers are an absolute mess or at least they were back when I covered it and then I think the neo
[1753.46 → 1759.22] is the one that has struck the best balance out of all of those three I absolutely freaking love this
[1759.22 → 1764.66] thing you can see that I'm uh in the middle of a Super Mario RPG run through right now I've been using
[1764.66 → 1771.46] it for retro games I've been using it for modern games the seven-inch screen is freaking awesome 720p at that
[1771.46 → 1779.22] size it's fine and that's a lot of what I based my take uh for this switch OLED my take that 720p was
[1779.22 → 1784.34] still okay even with the larger screen was actually based on doing so much of my gaming on the neo
[1784.34 → 1789.30] lately and finding if it's fine yeah it's not the sharpest thing ever whatever you want the sharpest
[1789.30 → 1794.74] thing ever go get an iPhone like it's not like you can't get a sharper display but if you want to play pc
[1794.74 → 1801.06] games I'd rather run them at native at a lower native resolution than running at a non-native
[1801.06 → 1806.74] resolution on my awesome high resolution display and the same is going to be true of the switch since
[1806.74 → 1812.42] Nintendo didn't upgrade the hardware i I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm being kind of defensive about
[1812.42 → 1818.98] this because you know I can see the work they put into it, I can see the cost they put into it, I'm
[1818.98 → 1825.94] extremely excited I'm passionate about these handheld pcs becoming a thing and I'm just finding
[1825.94 → 1833.70] this thing really exciting and so maybe I'm not being completely objective uh but I'm excited now
[1834.50 → 1838.82] now I want to know how stupid uh does dell feel
[1841.62 → 1848.82] okay do you remember this thing hold on a second uh in in in valve's statements and they
[1848.82 → 1855.62] did this with the steam pc as well I don't think they're trying to win this market I'm trying
[1855.62 → 1860.82] to I think they're trying to push this market forward so I don't think dell is out yeah but
[1860.82 → 1867.06] they've lost a lot of mind share by not just shipping this thing at some sure I mean they showed
[1867.06 → 1876.10] it a year and a half ago in a basically working state so yeah that's a little rough
[1876.10 → 1884.50] yeah and back to me being really passionate and defending this thing video cards has this
[1884.50 → 1890.02] excellent little table of all the similar products here so you've got your Nintendo Switch and switch
[1890.02 → 1895.62] light you've got your God win 3 hold on a second let me blow this up okay apparently I cannot well
[1895.62 → 1900.50] whatever call that good enough uh your God win 3 they've all got their pros and cons the win 3's got
[1900.50 → 1906.90] this keyboard so if you know enter text often but not that often you know that can be pretty cool
[1906.90 → 1912.98] I guess uh it's smaller this is actually pocketable whereas none of these other ones are particularly
[1912.98 → 1918.58] pocketable it's only got a five and a half inch display um the neo man this thing is freaking
[1918.58 → 1926.50] awesome um probably a very, very similar spec to what we're going to get with the steam I keep struggling
[1926.50 → 1934.18] I keep struggling to come up with the name um the steam deck uh hold on I actually want to
[1934.18 → 1939.86] double check because I didn't remember this thing having six cores but maybe I'm just yeah I'm drunk
[1939.86 → 1947.62] it does it totally has six cores six threads uh the uh one x player right here it has the biggest
[1947.62 → 1953.06] screen but kind of hampered by xc graphics blah blah blah like they've all got their pros and cons I think
[1953.06 → 1958.18] a neo also has like pretty, pretty compelling pricing even though it's higher it's actually
[1958.18 → 1966.34] higher than the steam deck um man okay there are a few things actually as someone who would be likely
[1966.34 → 1970.74] to just install windows on the thing because there's stuff that I do on it other than just
[1971.30 → 1978.42] you know use a browser and play games uh also windows is just my comfort zone the neo looks like
[1978.42 → 1983.62] a probably a better Windows machine just because they've got these uh like these shortcut keys
[1983.62 → 1988.74] so you've got a windows button whoop there we go you got a windows button you've got a button
[1988.74 → 1993.46] to bring up the on-screen keyboard escape task manager is really useful because no
[1993.46 → 1998.10] it's really useful because no I didn't mean it that way I was frowning because i was thinking in
[1998.10 → 2003.70] my head like you might be able to bind some of the keys on the probably could some of the back
[2003.70 → 2008.34] ones because it's so bad but steam deck uh but yeah you could probably bind some of those to those
[2008.34 → 2011.62] types of functions but yeah sorry keep going maybe you could, you don't want to hit them by accident
[2011.62 → 2018.10] either though um, but maybe you could bind some of the front ones if you use the back ones more often
[2018.10 → 2023.06] which honestly I think someone who's like min maxing their experience because of that hand position
[2023.06 → 2028.98] thing I was talking about might do that I guess so uh I don't know yeah I like anyway the point is i
[2028.98 → 2038.90] like those buttons also believe it or not um I like the I like the top uh Abby I like the top Abby
[2038.90 → 2045.22] I don't like the symmetrical joysticks I think that the steam deck is gonna win me over anyway
[2045.22 → 2050.74] just because they're they're kind of in line you just reach over your Abby if you need the dual joysticks
[2050.74 → 2055.46] I'm I'm pretty into that, but it's the kind of thing that I'm going to have to actually get hands-on with
[2055.46 → 2063.14] before I can draw any kind of conclusion one big downer about the neo is that these triggers are
[2063.14 → 2070.82] not analog they are just binary on or off triggers, but my understanding is that the neo is they said
[2070.82 → 2074.26] you can bind the touchpads apparently that's something that I probably wouldn't use so that
[2074.26 → 2080.18] I could be pretty into that uh oh you could probably bind parts of the touchpad I would
[2080.18 → 2085.14] think so yeah because if I recall correctly you could do cool stuff like that on the steam controller
[2085.14 → 2091.54] you might even be able to do gestures yep cash manager like an x all right that could be pretty
[2091.54 → 2098.58] cool that'd be pretty sweet that could be pretty cool oh man I'm excited man uh everyone's an
[2098.58 → 2106.18] analyst peeves says no not peeves uh hold on a second uh blah blah blah Nico you say or Nico a neo
[2106.18 → 2110.42] and God's fault is the moment when they chose to use windows yeah but you have to understand they didn't
[2110.42 → 2119.30] have the development resources to build proton I mean what other company other than valve could
[2119.30 → 2124.26] possibly have tackled that project hit me with one
[2129.06 → 2136.50] yeah I mean yeah maybe, maybe epic you know could have pushed into it earlier to because so many games
[2136.50 → 2141.78] are powered by Unreal Engine you know like there's but there are companies that could, but they wouldn't
[2141.78 → 2147.06] have the experience or the expertise to really do it properly or the motivation or the yeah stick with
[2147.06 → 2154.02] if there's basically no one else is going to do it yeah Microsoft yeah nice yeah sure yeah for sure
[2154.02 → 2162.50] they're for sure there bud they could yeah yeah yeah I mean haters going to hate there's people that are just
[2162.50 → 2168.10] not into it and not excited about that about it, I see that in the comments but for people who are
[2168.66 → 2171.30] okay hold on a second I'll be right back
[2173.94 → 2178.34] while he's gone I want to talk about something it's not in the doc or I might have missed it
[2179.22 → 2184.10] um skimming through I don't think it's in the doc um I don't think it was I don't know if it was
[2184.10 → 2189.86] technically this week I asked people what the date was they said it I blurred out and didn't really read
[2189.86 → 2194.98] it but GitHub copilot oh he's already back I thought he's going to be gone for longer GitHub copilot
[2196.74 → 2201.14] is crazy I've been talking for at least a decade about how something like this
[2201.70 → 2206.98] was needed something like this was going to happen and this is a thousand percent the future I don't
[2206.98 → 2214.10] know if this exact version of it is or not, but this type of thing is definitely the future yeah we
[2214.10 → 2219.70] got to talk about that later yeah okay sorry okay get back to this conversation for anyone
[2219.70 → 2227.14] who loved the shield I mean the real shield not the shield tablet which I think got renamed shield or
[2227.14 → 2234.50] the no no the shield console the android TV thing that got named shield later the original NVIDIA shield
[2234.50 → 2241.62] for anyone who loved this thing you've been waiting for a legitimate actual replacement for this thing
[2241.62 → 2250.90] for what like six years five years it's been a long freaking time well it finally happened you're
[2250.90 → 2256.58] running a full fat Linux install and valve has even come out and said hey if you want to go ahead
[2256.58 → 2265.54] and Huck windows on it there is a legitimate reason to be extremely excited right now so sure you know what
[2265.54 → 2271.46] you don't care about it that's fine, but you got to recognize it for what it is a full fat computer
[2271.94 → 2279.54] in a super thin portable form factor that can playful fat pc games it can stream games from your more
[2279.54 → 2287.62] powerful desktop it can play I can play emulated games you've got this enormous back catalogue potentially
[2288.42 → 2295.54] it's just super cool it's cool tech and if you don't like it then I think that you might not be
[2295.54 → 2302.98] looking outside your own needs and just appreciating it for the amazing technology that it is
[2303.54 → 2306.82] that's all I have to say all right
[2309.22 → 2313.78] let's talk about that it's not actually in the doc but I was reading about it as well lets uh let's
[2313.78 → 2320.82] talk about that Luke jump get us up to speed GitHub copilot well yeah I don't know how this
[2320.82 → 2325.78] passed by me but I didn't know about it until now um oh really someone asked in
[2325.78 → 2331.22] flow plane chat are you guys going to talk about GitHub copilot and I was like copilot I haven't heard
[2331.22 → 2337.54] of this and I looked it up and my brain was immediately blown um the fact that it's powered
[2337.54 → 2344.82] by open AI just totally makes sense and gives me a lot more confidence in it than other similar ideas
[2344.82 → 2348.98] that have been talked about slash announced slash done in the past and have always had some form of
[2348.98 → 2355.46] issue this is crazy so why don't you talk about what it's supposed to do and then I can talk about
[2355.46 → 2362.34] some of the surrounding controversy already oh I'm sure there's lots um and I'm sure it's not going to
[2362.34 → 2367.06] matter because I'm sure it's going to happen anyway so GitHub copilot it is supposed to suggest
[2368.26 → 2373.06] whole lines or entire functions of code and if you see their example I don't know if you're showing
[2373.06 → 2381.30] this on screen or not uh they're they're typing the first line of a function, and it's its
[2381.30 → 2391.46] auto completing the rest of it like crazy um not the examples that they're giving aren't necessarily all
[2391.46 → 2400.66] that out of this world um but even like it's just it's just the general concept of something
[2400.66 → 2407.78] that helps you develop by suggesting things and giving a guiding hand has been needed for a long
[2407.78 → 2413.62] time and will absolutely be something that's used yes on the extreme end of programming a lot of very
[2413.62 → 2419.46] seasoned programmers aren't going to want or likely won't use something like this unless they can find
[2419.46 → 2425.94] a way for it to be very, very lightweight and out of their way so they can use it just as a speed increase
[2425.94 → 2430.50] so they don't have to type certain things that's like pretty much probably the only way it's going to
[2430.50 → 2437.46] be used on the really high end what this is going to be groundbreaking for is new programmers going to
[2437.46 → 2443.46] be huge people that want to develop some little home automation thing for fun that they can do at
[2443.46 → 2449.62] home people that want to learn some basics um and can start you know known enough to be dangerous but
[2449.62 → 2456.98] can't really get a ton of things done um it's going to be massive and the further this goes forward the
[2456.98 → 2462.66] lower the barrier of entry into development is going to be and the easier it's going to be for
[2462.66 → 2469.54] individuals to develop their own things without being a seasoned professional which is massive super
[2469.54 → 2474.98] huge deal and I'm sure we're just seeing like the beginning splashes of what this can do
[2474.98 → 2479.38] considering it's powered by open AI we're going to see this grow and become stronger over time
[2479.62 → 2486.26] all right now let's talk about some of the uh controversy around it as with any kind of machine
[2486.26 → 2496.18] learning or AI tool uh copilot has to have some kind of data set that is done how exactly would it know
[2497.22 → 2505.62] how to complete that line uh if it didn't have some examples of code that had been written in the past
[2505.62 → 2514.42] now because this is coming from GitHub I think you guys see where I'm going with this the potential
[2514.42 → 2526.34] for GitHub to just scrape all the code submitted to the entire platform and then use it to train their AI
[2527.14 → 2534.34] is very high and that creates a number of problems I mean one problem is that the quality of the code could be
[2534.90 → 2540.90] sketchy at best it might not be the most optimized code that it suggests for your auto complete and
[2540.90 → 2552.18] number two is that the licensing for code doesn't really have any provision for this one way or the
[2552.18 → 2562.34] other to my understanding so without a developer's express consent GitHub might be training their AI based on
[2562.34 → 2571.30] their code which in and of itself is not necessarily plagiarism but then if it goes and suggests that
[2571.30 → 2582.50] exact snippet to another developer are they then as this middleman causing one developer to plagiarize the
[2582.50 → 2591.86] code of another without even knowing it yeah whoa crazy so here's something oh hold on I just want to
[2591.86 → 2600.02] talk about this uh kyle who posted congrats at David sells you get a shout-out if GitHub copilot
[2600.02 → 2605.70] tries to generate an about me page look at this about me, I'm a software engineer from the Bay Area
[2605.70 → 2611.94] currently working at Salesforce I love to learn new things and build things i have a
[2611.94 → 2624.50] a GitHub account that's accept solution that's auto-generated like that was clearly pulled
[2624.50 → 2634.26] straight off of David's website as uh as Jaden says it is says in quotes trained on billions of
[2634.26 → 2642.02] lines of public code um like directly on the landing page so, so yeah that that is exactly what's
[2642.02 → 2649.54] happening yeah it's pretty nuts you can literally have it like if you get into some of these examples
[2649.54 → 2656.74] that they have you can write comments, and it'll write the whole thing for you, it'll try at least
[2657.38 → 2662.34] yeah write a comment describing the logic you want and let GitHub copilot assemble the code for you
[2662.34 → 2667.38] it's going to be exactly what you want is it going to be efficient is it going to be whatever else I don't know
[2668.10 → 2673.86] but the fact that it's even going to try is wild um like what do schools do
[2673.86 → 2687.30] uh I don't know because it's probably because of how um open AI works it's probably not going to be
[2687.30 → 2693.38] the same every time so you're not going to be able to maybe you can like train people to use copilot
[2694.26 → 2700.58] or what like I don't know what I mean is like how do you verify that copilot just didn't write an
[2700.58 → 2710.02] entire student's assignment that's that's difficult because they could write a description for example
[2710.02 → 2713.22] they should, they could write a comment that describes what they want the code block to do
[2713.22 → 2716.58] yeah have the code block get generated and then change the comment
[2718.18 → 2721.14] it's like you don't know what led to the generation of that code like
[2722.58 → 2726.74] that's a difficult problem for uh well tony and wolf in twitch chat says it's going to lead to the
[2726.74 → 2732.82] replication of bugs across different software packages uh yeah yeah I think that's uh I think
[2732.82 → 2738.50] that's going to be a broad plains instant CS major degree speed run oh man
[2742.26 → 2748.58] that would be a really you know what that would be fascinating if like a university teacher
[2750.66 → 2756.74] gave this thing homework yeah and saw how well it scored like on multiple
[2756.74 → 2764.90] levels of uh of courses that would be fascinating I'll be interested to see how this is going to shake out
[2764.90 → 2772.98] I'll be interested to see how the legal challenges to um I guess what Microsoft's use of this code um
[2773.78 → 2774.82] ends up shaking out
[2777.54 → 2780.26] regardless of what happens this is going to have
[2780.26 → 2787.94] like I'm not going to have an immense impact on the world and like i I honestly like I'm not I don't
[2787.94 → 2795.06] think I'm sugarcoating that this is massive yeah like so much of the future is software development
[2795.06 → 2800.66] and programming and coding we talked about on the LAN show a long time ago how you should probably teach
[2801.78 → 2807.14] your kids to code regardless of what they want to do in the future they should probably understand to a certain
[2807.14 → 2816.58] degree some amount of software development um and this is massive because of all of that this is
[2816.58 → 2821.30] just absolutely huge, and it's just going to get better, and it's just going to grow because there's
[2821.30 → 2824.98] whatever legal problems they have I can pretty much guarantee they're going to make it through it
[2824.98 → 2832.82] because this is crazy and this is going to go away with money yep, yep like this is nuts yeah
[2832.82 → 2842.58] all right lets uh talk about our sponsors the show is brought to you today by pulseway.com

[2998.42 → 3004.82] things that i kind of wanted to talk about today, but we talked about other stuff a lot we did TSMC
[3004.82 → 3014.90] explores on-chip water cooling uh there's another yeah there's another crazy uh fab topic near the
[3014.90 → 3020.26] bottom of the dock which is huge but yes we can talk about on-chip water cooling first all
[3020.26 → 3027.46] right cool so German tech site hardware lux has reported on a presentation given by TSMC
[3027.46 → 3034.58] researchers at the latest VLSI symposium exploring new ways to cool silicon chips with the advent of
[3034.58 → 3040.02] vertical 3d stacking of transistors to density performance cooling is going to become even more
[3040.02 → 3045.46] challenging because heat from lower levels of the stack won't be easily dissipated the researchers from
[3045.46 → 3053.54] TSMC tested three cooling methods with integrated silicon micro channels etched in both a grid and
[3053.54 → 3059.94] linear pattern in their tests, so water would flow from one side to the other taking the heat with it
[3060.98 → 3066.90] this is incredible so for their tests they built an uh what do they call this thing a thermal test vehicle
[3066.90 → 3074.26] so we've got a slide from the presentation looks a little something like this okay uh, so this is direct
[3074.26 → 3083.70] water cooling okay silicon here so silicon lid with liquid metal thermal interface material okay oh my
[3083.70 → 3092.26] goodness this is so cool I absolutely freaking love it um their last prototype had the micro
[3092.26 → 3098.10] channels etched on the MTV directly, and they dubbed this direct water cooling it was the most effective
[3098.10 → 3103.94] dissipating 2.6 kilowatts of heat with a temperature delta of 63 degrees Celsius
[3104.26 → 3114.18] cool direct water cooling look at this madness we're talking water in channels in the silicon
[3114.90 → 3121.70] okay and this is compared to having thermal interface material uh between what is these two layers of
[3121.70 → 3127.78] silicon okay that's interesting I'm going to have to I'm going to have to dig into this a little bit more
[3127.78 → 3131.70] the point is water channels in silicon wow
[3135.70 → 3140.50] uh the grid pattern was found to be the most effective or more effective than the uh just the
[3140.50 → 3147.46] slots uh the linear pattern and uh yeah I guess that's pretty much that's pretty much it for that
[3147.46 → 3152.10] that's cool I hope to see it in the future uh realistically this is going to be the kind of thing you're going to
[3152.10 → 3158.74] see in like very specialized silicon more like industrial enterprise like supercomputer applications
[3158.74 → 3164.90] before you see it on a consumer product but yeah I mean that technology has a tendency to trickle its
[3164.90 → 3173.46] way down to the consumer and I would certainly be into it, you think that one would I doubt it yeah but you
[3173.46 → 3181.94] never know I mean a microprocessor in general started out as something that was not consumer grade so never
[3181.94 → 3190.34] never say that's what I've learned sure yeah I could also i so what I immediately jumped to was like DIY pcs
[3191.46 → 3196.58] I feel like it might be a bit of a stretch there but maybe in like non-user
[3196.58 → 3204.58] not friendly to user repair devices right where it's kind of built into everything, and it comes
[3204.58 → 3211.14] as a package I could see that being a thing um but yeah anyway let's let's scroll down a fair amount
[3211.14 → 3220.10] I think and talk about uh this which very likely won't happen but yeah uh intel is in talks to buy global
[3220.10 → 3222.90] foundries for 30 billion dollars
[3226.10 → 3232.02] dang how trick is new CEO has been looking for ways to spend money apparently and as part of these 50
[3232.02 → 3240.74] billion dollar plus price tag for his renaissance what intel is looking to buy global foundries um
[3240.74 → 3243.94] that's amazing if you've watched this show ever you probably know who they are they're a fab
[3243.94 → 3250.02] um some of global foundries major customers have included am dapple Qualcomm uh selenic Asus
[3250.02 → 3256.58] Cisco google Lenovo they make a lot of stuff it's a pretty big deal it's interesting the most
[3256.58 → 3264.42] mind-blowing part of it though is global foundries' origin, so global foundries was spun off back in 2009
[3264.42 → 3272.50] from AMD, so this would effectively I mean okay there are 12 years in between, and you know a lot of
[3272.50 → 3276.66] a lot of business dealings the relationship between AMD and global foundries has apparently
[3276.66 → 3284.02] soured somewhat over the last decade plus but this is effectively intel buying AMD's fabs
[3286.58 → 3294.42] and global foundries currently serves AMD which I'm sure you'd get into tons of legal problems if
[3294.42 → 3303.86] they tried to stop after they bought it, so intel might own AMD's fab, but then intel has also said that
[3303.86 → 3308.82] they're going to explore the idea of utilizing their own fab capacity for third-party independent
[3308.82 → 3314.50] customers so yes maybe interesting when you're doing it when you're serving the people that are
[3314.50 → 3320.74] currently kind of destroying you competing with you yeah, yeah well I mean Samsung does if it's not like
[3320.74 → 3327.94] Samsung has never produced a SOC for apple who they compete with directly it's just that Samsung's fab
[3327.94 → 3334.26] business is just a different it's a separate business so if intel decided okay yeah we're just
[3334.26 → 3340.34] going to treat that as a completely separate business unit intel foundry services um maybe it's
[3340.34 → 3347.86] not that crazy I mean I'm sure if I'm AMD I still just don't want to line intel's pockets in any way
[3347.86 → 3354.90] whatsoever to help them compete with me better but if it helps me compete better than maybe I do it anyway i
[3354.90 → 3362.98] i i I don't know man I don't know it's pretty it's pretty rough um we've got another topic here
[3362.98 → 3369.94] also from Anthony AMD fidelity effects super resolution is officially open source uh Anthony
[3369.94 → 3375.14] writes Linus before you yell at me for putting in too many wan topics it's 4 pm and nobody else is
[3375.14 → 3381.46] adding topics already pinged everyone else multiple times so here I am picking up the slack you're welcome
[3381.46 → 3391.06] all in caps AMD's easy to implement upscale has been officially added to their GPU open repository
[3391.06 → 3397.54] uh we found that FSR provides decent visual quality and performance in its ultra setting but ultimately
[3397.54 → 3403.54] does fall short of DSS digital foundry compared it to unreal engines temporal an upscaling algorithm
[3403.54 → 3410.34] and found that without the temporal element FSR did fall short however many games don't have access
[3410.34 → 3415.14] to upscales that sophisticated and won't bother upscaling at all leaving it to the GPU to
[3415.14 → 3420.82] effectively stretch the image so FSR being open source means it's now freely available to developers
[3420.82 → 3425.86] and dodders who want to take a crack at implementing it in games this open nature makes it more universally
[3425.86 → 3432.26] available because DSS relies on NVIDIA's tensor cores which you will only find in their 2000 and 3000
[3432.26 → 3437.22] series GPUs so with the source code released the community can also contribute patches and improve the
[3437.22 → 3442.10] design of the scaler which would be pretty cool allowing it to maybe reach the level of unreal
[3442.10 → 3451.22] engines AAU except in any engine uh meanwhile Microsoft is apparently working on a deep learning
[3451.22 → 3457.30] uh upscaling technology of their own that would be part of direct x12 at some point in the future
[3457.30 → 3463.62] so that would be platform-agnostic as well but I have no idea how well it would run obviously Microsoft
[3463.62 → 3467.86] is I don't know actually nothing's obvious with Microsoft any more maybe they wouldn't have that
[3467.86 → 3472.66] much interest in it running in on alternate platforms I'm not sure I don't know how would
[3472.66 → 3482.58] valve find a way to hack it working in protons i I have no idea so um maybe deep learning powered super
[3482.58 → 3488.26] sampling won't be NVIDIA exclusive forever maybe fidelity effects ultimately doesn't end up mattering
[3488.26 → 3493.62] or maybe they just coexist, and it's just yet another tool in your tool belt for making your
[3493.62 → 3496.74] games look better at higher resolutions on lesser hardware
[3499.54 → 3508.34] yeah um speaking of lesser hardware uh Microsoft announces windows 365 it's probably not what you think
[3508.34 → 3514.34] it is not subscription windows uh in the sense that you just you have a computer, and you pay a
[3514.34 → 3525.14] subscription to have windows it is not that um it there ah so azure virtual desktop which probably
[3525.14 → 3530.42] none of you know about unless you're really into that type of stuff has existed for a long time but
[3530.42 → 3536.98] this is now for the essentially uh it's a virtual private desktop in the cloud running
[3536.98 → 3542.10] Windows 10 eventually Windows 11 don't worry about that it is currently geared towards small businesses
[3542.10 → 3548.18] and i I don't think it says this in particular but I highly suspect education institutions it's going
[3548.18 → 3554.90] to be massive for because pretty much everyone there just needs like a browser and a word uh document
[3554.90 → 3564.58] editor um and that's amazing for this it's its aimed at uh deployments of under 300 machines uh there's
[3564.58 → 3569.86] a management interface so you can see a clear overview of every virtual desktop you have access to which is
[3569.86 → 3574.02] actually kind of cool because you might have access to more than one I could see situations where that
[3574.02 → 3582.18] would make sense um each virtual desktop has Microsoft Office if you have very low spec um setups you get
[3582.18 → 3587.46] web versions which is fine it has edged it has one drive it has array of other software it's really fantastic
[3587.46 → 3592.10] for Microsoft to get you in on this because you're probably going to be using a lot of their first party tools
[3592.10 → 3599.22] um all virtual desktops come with 10 gigabits per second download speeds and 4 gigabits per second upload speeds
[3599.94 → 3606.02] and the pricing is going to vary there are going to be a multitude of configurations one two four six
[3606.02 → 3614.34] and eight uh virtual CPU cores two four eight sixteen thirty-two gigs of ram 64 128 256 and 512 gigs of storage
[3616.34 → 3621.06] and apparently there's going to be more pricing information and whatnot on August the second you could
[3621.06 → 3625.06] do some real work with some of those specs like for school we're not talking just like
[3625.78 → 3630.74] docs necessarily we're talking you could do you know some actual engineering work and stuff like that
[3630.74 → 3635.38] and there's plenty of room for them to expand the offering in the future maybe offer dedicated GPUs or
[3635.38 → 3642.10] whatever the case may be uh Amazon workspaces does offer similar configs but doesn't come with office
[3642.10 → 3647.78] Citrix Workspace offers lower prices but starts at 500 seats um
[3647.78 → 3653.78] so Microsoft is looking reasonably competitive here, and you know what good for them and I'm glad that I don't have
[3653.78 → 3658.50] to pay subscription for running windows on my desktop yay yeah
[3658.50 → 3667.70] in other news the specs for three of intel's next gen alder lake s CPUs have been leaked thanks to a user on Zhu
[3667.70 → 3674.58] who these uh leaks are supposedly based on qualification samples which would mean they should be pretty
[3674.58 → 3684.74] close to final so the i9 12 900k i7 12 700k and i5 12 600k alder lake s is a big little style CPU so
[3684.74 → 3691.70] it's going to have 24 threads of which the big eight cores each have two threads with hyper threading and
[3691.70 → 3699.46] then the small eight cores do not have hyper threading uh the lower end chips are 12 core
[3700.02 → 3710.42] 20 thread and then 10 core 16 threads so okay that one get only gets six of the low power cores
[3710.42 → 3715.62] on the i5, and then it's eight on both the i7 and the i9 oh man this is going to be hard to keep track
[3715.62 → 3721.62] of so the 12 900k will be capable of boosting up to 5.3 gigahertz on one to two big cores
[3721.62 → 3726.66] and five gigahertz across all big cores and these chips are apparently going to have two TDPS
[3727.22 → 3736.34] at pl1 and pl2 with all three rated at 125 watts and 228 watts respectively they're built in at 10
[3736.34 → 3742.18] nanometre and the e-course will apparently boost much lower than the larger p-cores, but that's
[3742.18 → 3745.38] intentional because they aren't designed for performance they're designed for power saving
[3746.82 → 3751.38] these chips are going to support ddr5 and PCI Express gen 5 and if these are truly the specs
[3751.38 → 3757.78] based on qualification samples um it's likely that this is it this is what you're getting
[3757.78 → 3767.78] so for better or for worse the performance looks interesting um adjusting for the is clock speeds
[3767.78 → 3777.30] and looking at ES benchmarks that we saw it's estimated that a i9 will hit around 11 300 points
[3777.30 → 3780.98] which would actually which would actually put it a thousand points ahead of the 5950x
[3782.34 → 3789.14] huh with that said it's not like AMD is sitting still uh we are expecting refresh processors
[3789.14 → 3795.38] from AMD we just don't know exactly what they're going to be uh AMD may be skipping zen 3 plus and
[3795.38 → 3801.62] just releasing a zen 3 refresh of XT processors uh which could mean that intel has the performance crown
[3801.62 → 3806.66] back for one generation while AMD waits to leapfrog them again how exciting is it to have intel and
[3806.66 → 3812.26] AMD leapfrogging each other again it's cool that's what I love to see I don't even care who wins i just
[3812.26 → 3820.82] I wish they both are trying yeah yeah that's the key I hope the software starts to try to and I know some
[3820.82 → 3827.78] of it definitely does but I hope the consumer grade software starts to kind of catch up a little bit
[3827.78 → 3835.38] uh oh we've got some other interesting news so if you like the LTT underwear, but you don't actually
[3835.38 → 3843.14] like the new designs we did a reprint of the old designs with the new supplier so we have two
[3843.14 → 3848.58] different three packs now we have the old design three pack right here, and then we have the new
[3848.58 → 3856.66] design three pack right here so if you prefer the uh the stripy boys we did super cheap uh
[3856.66 → 3863.46] photoshop a super cheap photoshop job to turn the bands black, so the new bands are just plain black
[3863.46 → 3869.86] like the new design ones instead of having the like l Linus tech tips all around it um just gives
[3869.86 → 3874.66] it kind of cleaner look they still do have the little rubberized logo like that, but they are now
[3874.66 → 3881.46] available yay all this stuff is taking way longer than I had hoped and I guess that's pretty much oh yeah
[3881.46 → 3886.98] Netflix gaming is a thing uh I don't think there's really I don't think anyone knows really too much
[3886.98 → 3891.94] about it yeah yeah but Netflix wants to get into gaming I think what Netflix should get into is not
[3891.94 → 3897.38] just cancelling every show that they start that's what Netflix should get into if they want to build loyalty
[3898.50 → 3903.94] with sort of you know passionate fans who are into more niche shows because like I thought that was what
[3903.94 → 3909.70] they were good at, but that's a whole that's a whole other that's a whole other conversation just like the
[3909.70 → 3914.18] super chats are a whole other conversation I managed to pick the thing this time so I've I've got them
[3914.18 → 3921.22] all um troy asks did you know about the nest adapter for two-wire thermostats uh yes I'm aware of that
[3921.22 → 3927.30] my issue with nest is that it's cloud-based and I want everything local controlled so that I get that
[3927.30 → 3933.70] nice responsiveness uh sultan says I'm a night shift worker in Ontario just wanted to send a couple bucks
[3933.70 → 3937.62] say thanks for keeping me up during my ride to work and the first bit of work before the coffee kicks in
[3937.62 → 3943.78] hey no problem we got you uh flooder job he says they should have called it the SMP
[3943.78 → 3949.30] steam mobile platform sure I'd be into that yeah um
[3952.10 → 3958.02] ooh Stefan says will you guys please test some popular big games like GTA 5 Red Dead Redemption 2
[3958.02 → 3965.62] running from a reasonably fast micro SD you could do it on a pc before the deck launches or you could
[3965.62 → 3971.54] disable a couple of cores and do it on the a and neo which would actually probably give us a pretty
[3971.54 → 3976.90] darn good idea of what we're dealing with this thing has an oh snap does this thing not have a micro SD
[3976.90 → 3987.54] slot I did not realize that advantage steam deck mind you supports full-sized m.2s as long as they
[3987.54 → 3993.62] are I believe they have to be single-sided, but that means you can go up to four terabytes like with your
[3993.62 → 3999.86] SSD, but then you're spending eight hundred dollars uh if you go with like a WD black or something like
[3999.86 → 4003.94] that on a device that costs less than eight hundred dollars I don't know it's a whole other thing
[4004.58 → 4012.50] uh okay uh Finley hey thanks Finley thanks cold bud three uh lewis says iPhones cost twelve hundred
[4012.50 → 4018.50] dollars and no one bats an eye thank you the steam deck being four hundred dollars is freaking incredible
[4018.50 → 4024.74] uh Robert mail says can we get some spoilers on upcoming home automation collabs um I mean i already
[4024.74 → 4031.06] the only person that I have worked with so far I talked about in my previous video uh we're actually
[4031.06 → 4037.70] we're working through a lot of it Jake man Jake digs his teeth into projects like this he has already
[4037.70 → 4044.74] basically got the proof of concept for the per zone ac control with smart dampers working so we are
[4044.74 → 4048.42] planning to shoot a video I'm actually off next week, but we're planning to shoot a video next week
[4048.42 → 4052.42] because I'm going to be at the new house all the time anyway Jake's going to come over we're going
[4052.42 → 4056.50] to get the thermal camera out we're going to show where all the in-floor heating zones are which is
[4056.50 → 4061.94] going to be super cool uh we are going to show the proof of concept for how the smart dampers are going
[4061.94 → 4067.54] to work with honestly a really affordable implementation I'm I'm really excited about it
[4067.54 → 4076.02] Stefan says joysticks are mechanical why not optical sensors that's a good question I mean it's
[4076.02 → 4082.34] been done with devices like a trackball before my concern would be that they might actually drift kind
[4082.34 → 4088.74] of like a joystick might um but then if I think you could probably solve that through software making
[4088.74 → 4094.18] sure that it kind of re-zeros every time it yeah how would it know to re-zero I don't know interesting
[4094.18 → 4101.30] um Blake says consoles are sold at a loss they can't do that without the profit from games okay
[4101.30 → 4107.46] but you did overlook one small thing this will ship with steam OS and valve will get plenty of profit from
[4107.46 → 4114.18] the games so I think the reason they wouldn't sell it at a loss is because valve ultimately doesn't care
[4114.18 → 4118.98] who makes the hardware they will get their 30 regardless of whether you buy a steam deck or an
[4118.98 → 4127.46] a neo or whatever else Chris says might be a good price for the engineering but not for what it'll
[4127.46 → 4132.34] likely be used for IMO which is random cheapo steam games most people who care about steam don't need
[4132.34 → 4140.66] a 400 tiny pc at this price so who is this for bad take Chris oh you spent 20 to send me such a bad take
[4140.66 → 4150.34] yeah you can't, you can't, you can't tell someone else sort of what like the games that they play are
[4150.34 → 4158.10] not they're random and cheapo and therefore not worthy of spending 400 on a device that lets them take
[4158.10 → 4165.62] them with them what if they love those games and besides you can play like anything about PS3
[4165.62 → 4177.46] Wii U and or excuse me we PS3 we and back on this thing that is an immense accessible game library
[4177.46 → 4183.14] that's an incredibly difficult statement to even make because you'd have to assess every single
[4183.14 → 4187.70] game that you can play on that device in order to make that statement that's really it's going to be
[4187.70 → 4195.06] really hard like honestly i i I love this thing you know we should do a straw poll let's do a straw poll
[4195.06 → 4207.14] um here we go so create a poll all right steam deck so we're going to have a few different statuses
[4207.14 → 4216.26] pre-ordered thinking about it probably not because you know you're feeling that it's not right
[4216.26 → 4222.74] for you that's totally valid your admin rights are temporary, but you're creating a free account
[4222.74 → 4229.38] okay yeah whatever I don't know okay let's send this link so you have every right to not think
[4229.38 → 4236.42] that it's great for you, but you can't just assume other people's other people's game preferences and
[4236.42 → 4243.70] like what they're passionate about right all right there you go let's get some results up in here ladies
[4243.70 → 4248.66] and gentlemen oh that's because that's not the normal straw poll dot me is the normal
[4248.66 → 4259.54] straw poll oops oh well whatever it's working it's probably fine yep so we've got a massive over 70
[4260.18 → 4267.54] almost 75 of our audience saying pre-ordered or thinking about it uh okay
[4267.54 → 4278.90] those are okay so we're settling in at around 70 those are massive massive numbers
[4280.34 → 4286.34] so Chris you're not into it that's cool a lot of people are a lot of people play a lot of different
[4286.34 → 4293.62] kinds of games like hey check this out what's that oh we got what is that Mario Kart we're running on this
[4293.62 → 4298.66] thing and to be very clear if you're not into it, we're not saying you should be yeah you don't have
[4298.66 → 4303.70] to be but if you're is you're the kind of person that you know bought a DS so what's that a couple
[4303.70 → 4310.82] hundred bucks so that you could play Mario Kart on the toilet well this is twice the price okay sure
[4310.82 → 4319.06] but has so much more functionality, and it can totally do that like this runs basically flawlessly in
[4319.06 → 4325.06] dolphin emulator on this thing and this is very similar hardware two more cores but my understanding
[4325.06 → 4331.94] is that dolphin emulator doesn't actually take advantage of many cores uh particularly anyway so
[4332.90 → 4337.94] got my fps counter up in the corner you guys probably can't see that, but it is locked at 60 sorts of
[4337.94 → 4344.26] actually it dips down to like 58 56 you'll hit 50 during like a loading screen or whatever something
[4344.26 → 4351.94] like that, but it goes ladies and gentlemen it goes you can see my uh my lights man it gets so bright
[4351.94 → 4357.78] here I'm trying to remember the buttons for these whoops there's your problem where's my jump
[4359.62 → 4363.62] I could have sworn jump was you know what I might have screwed up my key bindings I have another
[4363.62 → 4368.58] emulator open in the background I have a SNES emulator open in the background so I think that's
[4368.58 → 4377.30] probably the problem and the gap between something like this and a no backlight original game boy um
[4377.94 → 4382.58] which I know none of them had backlights I'm just clarifying because that was a big thing the road
[4382.58 → 4389.70] trip experience gap between the no backlight original game boy and this is just absolutely
[4389.70 → 4396.98] incredible oh for sure absolutely for sure bud sorry I'm just going to make sure I don't lose my progress
[4396.98 → 4403.30] in Super Mario RPG make sure I close that properly all right so I was just in the middle of a fight so
[4403.30 → 4411.14] I hadn't saved uh oh, oh whoa I missed something whoa Anthony pointed out the neo has Vega graphics
[4411.14 → 4419.86] and the steam deck has rdna2 graphics so uh in terms of GPU I would expect the steam deck to be significantly
[4419.86 → 4426.58] more powerful while CPU on the neo might be a touch better um, but we don't know it would only
[4426.58 → 4432.34] be for applications that will really take advantage of those extra cores uh MAL says the Australians got
[4432.34 → 4436.26] short-changed again there's no way to pre-order here we still haven't gotten the valve index yeah
[4437.14 → 4441.70] that's real frustrating I mean I went through that with the index the only way I was able to get it was
[4441.70 → 4447.22] by having uh john our writer for tech quickie order it and then ship it to me and then when I had a
[4447.22 → 4451.70] problem with it valve gave me a really hard time about the fact that I was Canadian and I had a
[4451.70 → 4460.18] U.S. product um profits business guru says I think some people don't appreciate the value of good
[4460.18 → 4467.38] hardware good stuff costs money yeah 100 totally does valve say the biggest thing is the deck
[4467.38 → 4470.58] allows for third-party apps so if you install retro arch you'll have one of the best portable
[4470.58 → 4476.42] emulation rigs money can buy that's where the value is for me yeah 100 100 100 uh PSP
[4476.42 → 4485.14] one so says thoughts on the 1280 by 860 hertz yeah yeah I love 16 by 10 just like you but I wish
[4485.14 → 4489.62] that it was at least possible to unlock a higher refresh rate even if it does kind of crush the
[4489.62 → 4498.90] battery uh cross co's says imagine saying steam deck with an Aussie accent okay that cost 20 Australian
[4498.90 → 4503.14] dollars to send me that message uh Presley says I know you don't actually do super chats but I'm
[4503.14 → 4506.50] always working during the show so I never get to watch live, but it's always the highlight of my
[4506.50 → 4511.14] night slash end of week after work just wanted to say thanks lttstore.com hey thanks Presley
[4511.70 → 4517.54] appreciate you family joey says should I buy it right away or wait like a year until it's proven to be
[4517.54 → 4523.54] perfect slash bad well if you wait a year valve might have just discontinued it so
[4524.82 → 4530.58] uh just saying that's very true just saying that's a very good you want to buy a steam link
[4530.58 → 4534.42] son you want to buy uh you want to buy a steam controller
[4536.50 → 4542.50] uh one thing I will give them credit for it will still work that's fair that's true they did
[4542.50 → 4549.62] they did do that thing uh is Julia melt why did you build an alternate video platform called float plane
[4549.62 → 4553.38] then neglect to put the android app on alternate app stores like droid
[4553.38 → 4560.66] I confess it had never occurred to me to put it on there why wouldn't you just get it on the Google
[4560.66 → 4569.62] play store am I missing something I mean you could just side literally never had that request yep
[4569.62 → 4582.02] right yep I mean you could just go to uh what's one of the trusted APK sites is APK pure okay
[4584.42 → 4590.02] I don't know the point is just gone find a trusted APK site I'm sure like DA developers can help guide
[4590.02 → 4597.46] you there and download the APK and sideload it hey that's android for you right um yeah
[4599.54 → 4604.42] I am very excited about sideloading apps in Windows 11 directly instead of having to use some
[4604.42 → 4610.10] emulator stuff, but that's a totally different thing this is great Edward Bratton says how it started
[4610.10 → 4616.26] bitcoin 62 000 how it's going now please buy these Chinese GPUs we threw on the floor
[4616.26 → 4623.06] yeah pretty much uh Vince asked will you be doing separate videos for each room upgrade of your new
[4623.06 → 4629.38] house or will you just do another house tour once it's all done there will be videos the next one is
[4629.38 → 4634.26] going to be me and Jake going through proof of concept for the HVAC I'm trying to get like water
[4634.26 → 4640.66] cooled solar panels there will be a video about that if I pull it off um I want to do obvious probably a
[4640.66 → 4646.02] couple videos about the home theatre like I'm going to be milking it for content because it's something
[4646.02 → 4650.98] that I'm going to be spending a lot of my time on over the coming months anyway so I might as well
[4650.98 → 4655.70] be making videos about it, and it's also an opportunity to explore tech that i otherwise
[4655.70 → 4660.02] wouldn't really have access to we can't get samples of everything so if I'm buying stuff I'm definitely
[4660.02 → 4667.06] going to want to get more value out of it and make a video out of it um all right ask says any chance
[4667.06 → 4672.34] we might see more LTT crew faces in main Ltd videos maybe I'm forgetting appearances but lately I'm kind
[4672.34 → 4677.30] of missing Riley James Madison Sarah etc uh well I was on vacation last week and I'm on vacation again
[4677.30 → 4682.02] this coming week, so definitely some videos got shot without me, you just got to wait for them to
[4682.02 → 4686.98] show up also if you're on flow plane you'll get exclusive behind the scenes interviews with people
[4686.98 → 4694.66] and all that kind of stuff as well uh peter says the steam deck price is amazing though if any company
[4694.66 → 4698.90] could slash would take a big hit on the cost it would be valved since they still take their 20 to 30
[4698.90 → 4706.26] absolutely other pc makers do not have that luxury all right I think that is pretty much it for the
[4706.26 → 4713.14] show today thank you so much just to make a quick comment on that one you see fairly often consoles
[4713.14 → 4717.46] take a pricing hit because they want to make money on peripherals they want to make money on game sales
[4717.46 → 4722.90] they want to make money on whatever else um, but that's kind of tough to do like Linus just said
[4722.90 → 4728.98] with traditional pc sales because they don't have the ability to do those things uh so they need to
[4728.98 → 4734.58] make their money off the original sale they Gabon trying to be really price competitive on this is
[4734.58 → 4740.10] probably because what Linus is saying earlier um this is going to make it very valuable for certain
[4740.10 → 4745.54] people to play certain games um and someone brought up in float plane chat right after Linus said
[4745.54 → 4751.54] that an extremely common purchase for people that bought a switch were games they've played before
[4751.54 → 4757.38] yeah they just bought a cartridge for the switch and if you don't own a certain game on steam because
[4757.38 → 4761.62] you're not going to play it at your desktop this will very likely drive sales for those types of
[4761.62 → 4767.06] oh for sure I will, they are going to get value out of this after it's sold is what I'm trying
[4767.06 → 4771.86] to say I will buy games that I otherwise wouldn't have bought on steam like there's uh there's a
[4771.86 → 4778.74] Final Fantasy 6 and 5 remake coming that honestly I'm just I'm not going to sit on my couch at my TV
[4778.74 → 4784.42] or at my desktop and play those games it's just not going to happen on here whole other ball of
[4784.42 → 4791.94] wax yeah whole other ball of wax definitely all right thanks for tuning into the show this week
[4791.94 → 4800.58] ladies and gentlemen we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[4808.74 → 4826.50] you
