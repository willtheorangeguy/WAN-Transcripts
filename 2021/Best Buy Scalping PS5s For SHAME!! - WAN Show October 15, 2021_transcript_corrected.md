[0.00 → 1.28] Fortunately, we're not live yet.
[2.42 → 6.56] I thought it was going to be like really quiet, but it just super wasn't.
[7.06 → 7.72] It was awesome.
[9.40 → 11.62] Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[11.76 → 14.04] We are back in the studio once again.
[14.24 → 14.50] Yes.
[14.54 → 15.48] We heard you guys.
[15.58 → 20.16] You said, wow, we really liked the WAN Show being in the studio with Luke and Linus together.
[20.16 → 21.88] And we said, you know what?
[22.44 → 23.86] That was the plan already.
[24.12 → 24.32] Yeah.
[24.36 → 25.72] So that worked out great for everyone.
[25.88 → 27.76] A lot of great topics for you guys today.
[27.76 → 33.42] Best Buy has been accused of scalping PlayStation 5s.
[33.48 → 36.84] That is a pretty controversial topic.
[37.14 → 42.94] Speaking of controversy, we have a video coming out that isn't even up on YouTube yet,
[43.04 → 47.18] but has managed to split our community, generating a fair bit of controversy.
[47.18 → 52.80] We're going to be talking about the Assani PC build later on in the show.
[52.88 → 54.00] What else we got today, Luke?
[54.00 → 58.52] You've heard of the Five Pro, but have you heard about the Five Flow?
[59.42 → 59.86] Probably.
[60.24 → 60.46] Yes.
[60.46 → 61.46] Because it all leaked.
[61.60 → 61.78] Yeah.
[61.86 → 63.18] And also it's announced now, but yes.
[63.32 → 66.94] And this is an aggregation show at the end of the week.
[67.00 → 71.50] So you've probably heard about all of this kind of stuff, like the Pixel 6 and Pixel Pass,
[71.72 → 72.60] which were also leaked.
[73.16 → 73.88] We'll talk about that later.
[73.88 → 75.48] Let's roll that intro.
[75.48 → 75.54] Let's roll that intro.
[75.54 → 77.54] Let's roll that intro.
[77.54 → 78.48] Let's roll that intro.
[78.48 → 83.98] Let's roll that intro.
[84.00 → 87.24] Let's roll that intro.
[87.30 → 89.72] The BOX
[89.72 → 91.66] Dry
[101.18 → 103.20] The thing I worked for was part of an суп-run game until in general, that was critical,
[103.20 → 107.40] sent listens to GM students to retain Helene.
[107.40 → 113.80] let's see if this works oh okay uh and fresh books um well we're still getting
[115.16 → 121.08] we're still getting the hang of being back in the studio how did that even work I will explain it
[121.08 → 126.92] when you're older so why don't we jump right into our first topic for the day best buy has been
[126.92 → 134.44] accused of scalping PlayStation 5. so they're PlayStation 5. these PlayStation 5. um the
[134.44 → 140.76] latest PS5 restock happened earlier this week, but there's a catch anyone looking to make a purchase
[140.76 → 150.44] will also have to be a member of best buys total tech program yeah 200 annually 200 annual with that
[150.44 → 157.00] said the total tech program does have a lot of great benefits Luke for example you get 24 7 tech support
[157.00 → 163.96] 24 months of product protection on best buy purchases free delivery access to
[163.96 → 171.32] exclusive total tech member prices extended exchange windows and VIP access to dedicated phone
[171.32 → 177.56] and chat teams so it's like Amazon Prime for Best Buy but with different stuff it's like a Costco
[177.56 → 182.28] membership but with different stuff yeah but with completely different actually it's like very
[182.28 → 187.88] similar so Costco's whole thing is like perfect support extended exchanges do you have the product
[187.88 → 192.28] protection the right to buy stuff at all well with Costco it's not even like a matter of whether you
[192.28 → 196.20] have product protection just like you just like to bring it in literally take it back and you're like
[196.84 → 203.40] I don't like it anymore it I ran it into a wall and I don't like it anymore to be clear that's an
[203.40 → 210.52] huge problem because to my knowledge Costco does not actually put those items back on the shelf
[210.52 → 217.48] and a lot of the time they actually end up getting wasted so um yeah so Costco has a lot of leverage over
[217.48 → 224.12] its partners and they will basically just say well we got it back so you're taking it um yeah you're
[224.12 → 230.20] well in a lot of cases no it'll be we got it back so we are not paying for it oh and we are just going
[230.20 → 235.24] to eat it because we can't be bothered to send it back now I could be wrong it's possible that Costco
[235.24 → 240.52] doesn't work that way anymore or has never worked that way I'm just this is my this is my disclaimer so
[240.52 → 246.92] that I don't get myself into trouble here but allegedly a lot of big box stores a lot of big
[246.92 → 252.60] box stores do operate that way, and they will have extremely long payment terms like net 180.
[253.24 → 258.60] so they are not even paying for the product until six months after they've received it so in a lot of
[258.60 → 262.84] those cases they could put it out on the show floor someone could buy it take it home use it for three
[262.84 → 267.40] months bring it back say you know what forget it I don't want it anymore, and they will just literally
[267.40 → 273.64] not pay for it and the manufacturer has no leverage whatsoever they could demand to be paid but then
[273.64 → 279.64] they're going to lose that account, and you don't want to do that you don't want to lose like Costco
[279.64 → 285.96] or Walmart anyway back to the issue with the best bye bye I'm going to play devil's advocate here
[285.96 → 296.92] and I'm going to say it's not that crazy okay why I'm going to say it's not that crazy because they are
[296.92 → 304.36] far from the only retailer to require some kind of membership in order to get access to I mean buy
[304.36 → 311.00] the product at all let alone buy the product at you know a given price I mean that kind of thing
[311.00 → 317.48] totally exists and yeah so so so here's so here basically what I'm doing is the reason I brought up
[317.48 → 323.48] Costco is because I'm going to draw a parallel there if Costco got a restocking of PlayStation 5s
[323.48 → 330.60] you would have to pay a membership in order to buy it now is best by disrupting the status quo here
[330.60 → 334.84] because they had never previously required a membership in order to get access to these hot
[334.84 → 339.80] products absolutely, and it's specifically just for hot products so it's not the same as Costco because
[339.80 → 344.76] Costco is like access to the store as a whole and the mostly other memberships are free like
[345.88 → 351.88] a lot of grocery store memberships they'll show like oh this thing is I don't know five cents cheaper
[351.88 → 357.56] whatever if you have the membership yes, but that's a free membership uh yes yeah yes it's a little
[357.56 → 362.20] different from 200 bucks a year how much is a Costco membership isn't it 80 something like that yeah
[362.20 → 367.64] that's for access to the entire store this is 200 membership for access to as far as I know like
[369.24 → 375.16] one item like is it just a PlayStation well hold on I couldn't find anything out maybe it's not just
[375.16 → 379.72] one item maybe you could buy as many PlayStation as you want which could be beneficial in your life
[382.04 → 388.12] look I'm just making connections here I'm just saying that you could pretty easily justify
[388.12 → 395.56] a 200 best buy membership if you were a filthy PlayStation 5 scalper yeah so that means scalpers
[395.56 → 399.48] helping scalpers right the best buys doing it now you're doing it that's I think we're really okay
[399.48 → 405.80] whoa whoa whoa hold on we did not we have not charged any membership fees for anything
[406.76 → 411.64] except float plane wait I didn't mean you and float plane has no benefits we don't even do early
[411.64 → 417.08] access there any more actually they do have benefits they do have benefits we do exclusives and behind
[417.08 → 421.24] the scenes meet the team meet the team is pretty cool cutting room floor is one of my favourite though
[421.24 → 426.52] especially with stuff like the intel extreme tech upgrades because those videos I mean we'll have like
[426.52 → 433.56] four five six hours of footage to make a 20-minute video yeah there's a lot of a material that ends up
[433.56 → 439.72] on the cutting room floor yeah uh anyway the point is look I am not going to defend best buy but what
[439.72 → 446.36] I have seen or i rather I'm not going to earnestly defend best buy I was playing devil's advocate before
[446.36 → 451.96] I don't I don't like it at all I'm not going to defend best buy but I saw people calling for their heads
[451.96 → 459.16] saying it should be illegal, and the truth is it's not it's not illegal they are far from the only
[459.16 → 464.92] retailer to require some kind of membership I mean even there's a badminton club that I play at where
[464.92 → 470.28] you have to buy a membership in order to have the privilege to buy court time buying court time yeah
[470.28 → 477.72] this is not an unusual business model it just is a new one for a company like
[477.72 → 486.12] best buy who has I think tried very hard over the decades they've been in business to be more
[486.12 → 491.72] mainstream I think best buy has tried and succeeded at being a mainstream source for technology
[492.28 → 500.68] and in my opinion the damage that they're doing to their brand right now is uh far greater than the
[500.68 → 509.08] revenue that they could possibly hope to make from this move um the weird thing to me is like I'm
[509.08 → 513.72] looking at the total tech website yeah and honestly like there's a couple of things that I noticed on here
[513.72 → 517.48] that that weren't directly in the notes like there's the best buy protection thing but also if you buy an
[517.48 → 524.04] apple product it comes with Apple Care plus yeah, yeah like okay, okay free installation of things that
[524.04 → 528.68] you could reasonably have installation for when I first read that I was like will you install my PlayStation
[528.68 → 534.52] uh but no it's like TVs and appliances right um some VIP access whatever okay it doesn't sound that
[534.52 → 538.92] bad like I don't want it but like they already do stuff like this doesn't sound too outside
[538.92 → 543.72] the grain and then when they're talking about the things that you gain yeah they don't even mention
[543.72 → 550.52] exclusive items they mention access to exclusive total tech member prices right which is very in line
[550.52 → 554.76] with a lot of these other programs they don't mention the exclusive items so that's very interesting to
[554.76 → 560.20] me Anthony's clearly watching the show he's typing in the doc right now he goes extended warranty and
[560.20 → 564.76] 24 7 tech support is a big benefit that used to be its own thing for that much so yeah some of you
[564.76 → 569.24] might not know this but Anthony actually used to work for geek squad in fact you used to work for geek
[569.24 → 574.20] squad that's right um so yeah like this doesn't really seem that bad it's actually kind of interesting
[574.20 → 580.20] especially if you do buy a lot of tech from there like a lot of PlayStation I like you know if you
[580.20 → 583.80] just like to buy a lot of PlayStation the yeah the weird thing to me is that it doesn't actually
[583.80 → 591.16] mention the exclusive items and the timing makes a ton of sense if I was best buy and
[591.16 → 596.92] I wanted to milk the holiday season for as much as humanly possible the timing for introducing a
[596.92 → 601.96] program like this is absolutely perfect for trying to catch those holiday shoppers that will pay
[602.76 → 609.48] anything that would pay a thousand dollars to put a PlayStation 5 under the tree but this way what
[609.48 → 613.48] best buy is effectively doing is they're taking that money instead of the sky they're taking that
[613.48 → 619.64] couple hundred dollars, and they're taking it rather than letting a scalper make it so here is a
[619.64 → 625.24] question for you and this really is one of those questions that has no easy answer Luke
[626.92 → 636.60] if that PlayStation 5 is going to sell for 700 let's say because uh the disk drive version is 500 plus 200
[636.60 → 642.92] for this best buy membership if it's going to sell for 700 who should get that money
[644.68 → 651.00] so let's assume we live in a world where there's nothing we can do to keep it out of the
[651.00 → 655.48] hands of scalpers, and effectively you are not going to be able to get it for MSRP
[655.48 → 662.36] who should get that money should it be Sony should it be the retailer should it be a scalper I think
[662.36 → 666.76] you saw that argument coming um and I do want to talk about that I did see that argument we can
[666.76 → 676.60] we can head it off at the pass afterwards um i I don't know I don't I don't like answering this i
[676.60 → 682.92] guess because I don't think best buy should do it because then when does that get pulled back
[683.80 → 690.76] well it gets pulled back when Best Buy is feels like under natural comp competitive pressure from
[691.40 → 700.76] EB games or from Amazon or whoever else like pricing the one thing capitalism does pretty well is it
[700.76 → 706.52] drives down pricing when you have legitimate competing entities and they could keep this
[706.52 → 712.12] type of system around forever in a way because they don't they don't say what products honestly again
[712.76 → 717.40] on their website they literally don't mention exclusive products at all I think this system
[717.40 → 723.16] is here to stay and i I think it's going to be very relevant around like console launch, but we're not
[723.16 → 727.96] talking about the system though we're talking about if they just increased the price to what the
[727.96 → 733.24] market will bear which clearly 700 I mean these things are they're going to sell out instantly
[733.24 → 737.48] I think yeah I think they'd sell for more than that so if they just increased if just increase the
[737.48 → 742.44] price if someone has to do it should Sony take the additional money should the retailer take the
[742.44 → 750.52] additional money or should a scalper take the additional money I don't think it should be the
[750.52 → 755.80] retailer for I don't think it should be basically anyone hold on it's going to come down to
[755.80 → 763.56] scalpers let me take let me take i I'm going to take a stand here as a former retailer employee we don't
[763.56 → 767.00] make that much I don't think it I don't think it should be the retailer I don't think it should be
[767.00 → 772.52] anyone and I think that results in it should be the scalper if I'm being fair the reason why I'm saying
[772.52 → 777.96] that is because it's just going to get marked up again the market will bear well then why shouldn't
[777.96 → 784.60] the retailer increase the price again so what the market will be like I could honestly see like
[784.60 → 791.88] 1200 PlayStation so the question for you becomes if because I think the price to the consumer goes up
[793.00 → 797.00] because I think the scalpers are just going to hit harder if this becomes the norm so tell me the price
[797.00 → 803.16] the consumer goes up if the retailer takes more what's the difference the retailer is just a middleman
[803.16 → 812.04] the scalper is just a middleman ultimately the pricing is dictated by what insane people who want
[812.04 → 818.60] to put a PlayStation 5 under the Christmas tree are willing to pay they're not the ones making craziness
[818.60 → 824.92] happen yeah yeah I'm not I'm not what's the difference I don't think anyone should be retailer
[826.44 → 830.28] which we're going to get into do you want to literally just further in the notes you want a vanilla
[830.28 → 835.40] middleman you want a chocolate middleman yeah what kind of middleman you want neapolitan
[835.40 → 843.88] middleman um i I want other solutions i I don't I think this is too basic and i, and we've been
[843.88 → 847.24] talking about this for a long time we've done a little bit of our own efforts maybe we should
[847.24 → 851.80] do verified actual gamer for consoles I don't know if we could get our hands on them, we'd absolutely do it
[851.80 → 857.64] yeah and I don't know that verified actual gamer is the best solution no it's not a perfect solution no
[857.64 → 863.48] but I think there are better solutions well okay what I mean verified actual gamer program was the
[863.48 → 867.48] the best thing I could come up I think it's the best I think it's the best thing that we could have done
[867.48 → 872.52] well what could best buy do I don't necessarily know the best why I can do a ton better but PlayStation
[872.52 → 879.72] can I mean what are okay, okay so here's a proposal you could have a national registry okay nice uh of
[879.72 → 884.36] of put all their sin numbers in the HTML I'll play later yeah well it would be a social security number in
[884.36 → 889.72] the U.S. right but whatever the equivalent of your personal identification number okay so you
[889.72 → 897.40] you enter you create a console buyer database, and you ensure that for each individual
[897.40 → 902.84] person only one console and a maximum of five controllers can be purchased in case they break one
[903.40 → 907.24] but then that's it that's the rules that's all that's all you're allowed to have I think having
[907.24 → 911.80] some type of some type of registration process for buying a console is fine I don't think I don't
[911.80 → 915.32] think you have to use a social security number I think there are other ways, but then there's I mean
[915.32 → 919.96] there's going to be a way around it, I mean we talked about this back when bc rolled out that vaccine
[919.96 → 926.12] that vaccine app where basically you just like flashed this app that it is so stupid because it's just
[926.12 → 932.84] a screenshot of okay there's a QR code it's like it's better now but the point is it was basically just
[932.84 → 937.96] um that there was a there's a screenshot that you could just show to anyone and unless they had the
[937.96 → 941.72] scanner which nobody had them, yet there was no way that they could validate anything and then before
[941.72 → 948.84] that it was literally a piece of paper like your vaccine verification documentation was a piece
[948.84 → 954.20] of paper that when you went in and got immunized they didn't even they didn't even yeah I'm just
[954.20 → 959.72] making sure there's if someone cares what lot number of Pfizer I got then they can see it I guess
[959.72 → 966.28] it doesn't matter the point is they gave you this stupid piece of cardboard that could obviously be
[967.00 → 974.28] like copied in two seconds, and they were when I crossed the border they didn't even want to see
[974.28 → 977.80] the app I was like gonna load up the app and show it to them, they were like no I need your piece of
[977.80 → 981.72] paper they didn't even tell me to keep this I just held on to it because I was like I don't know this
[981.72 → 985.64] seems like someone might ask about it, they told me to keep they told you to keep it well they didn't
[985.64 → 991.24] tell me ridiculous I think I got mine before you so maybe it was clearer by that point that people
[991.24 → 997.40] were going to need them yeah so I think it's just it's okay there's no right way to do a registry then
[997.40 → 1002.92] because either it's going to be something that can be easily fooled like that I mean your two examples
[1002.92 → 1007.00] have nothing to do with how this would work or there are ways around, or it's going to be overreach
[1007.00 → 1013.08] I mean we can't have retailers you know having databases of citizens that's madness I mean you
[1013.08 → 1022.44] sort of do in a way i know I like it's a thing that doesn't mean we should enable it more
[1023.64 → 1030.68] it's pretty much the same right because if is PlayStation retracts and goes like no all the
[1030.68 → 1034.92] retailers are doing a horrible job we're going to track this from now on we're going to manage this
[1034.92 → 1041.40] from now on they could do it you mean Sony who did I say PlayStation but like yeah so if Sony
[1041.40 → 1045.80] decides to create their own registry well then you've got all kinds of other complicated issues
[1045.80 → 1052.92] because you've got effectively a foreign entity that is collecting information on like you know
[1052.92 → 1058.20] American or Canadian or European citizens regardless though because if you have like a PSN account you have
[1058.20 → 1063.08] to put in all your information that's true but to buy a PlayStation you don't need to have a PSN account
[1063.88 → 1068.92] yeah I don't I think it's I think they're still getting information regards i they could also
[1068.92 → 1074.76] work with retailers to have like one pool that the other retailers don't get to see but like when you
[1074.76 → 1080.52] try to check out it compares against, and you're going to have people abuse it anyway I mean one of the
[1080.52 → 1086.20] the biggest problems for retailers is not their policy is going to buy a PlayStation yeah there's definitely ways
[1086.20 → 1092.36] around it but I feel like some amount of effort would be better than clearly nothing like there 's's
[1092.36 → 1097.00] individual people that are getting hundreds of these and like the same things happening with
[1097.00 → 1102.60] graphics cards right people are getting pallets of them like there is some amount of work
[1102.60 → 1108.12] that is actively being done not by the scalpers to funnel these things into scalpers hands because
[1108.12 → 1112.44] it's easier for these groups of people to do absolutely because if they receive a pallet of
[1112.44 → 1117.16] graphics cards you don't have to market it anymore you don't have to deal with a bunch of customers
[1117.16 → 1121.48] any more you can make an agreement returns you can make an agreement with these miners or scalpers or
[1121.48 → 1125.48] whoever that there are no returns reduce transaction fees you can do all this kind of stuff but just
[1125.48 → 1129.40] selling the whole pallet is one thing right and you guys got to understand like particularly in
[1129.40 → 1136.92] computer retail you're lucky to make five to six points on a sale yeah so okay let's let's break that
[1136.92 → 1143.40] down right because you've got to pay probably I think NCI after some fixed amount paid about a one
[1143.40 → 1149.08] percent commission on your sales okay so maybe you're paying a salesperson commission even if
[1149.08 → 1154.12] you're not you're paying them to stand there and sell it instead of something selling something else
[1154.12 → 1160.76] um, so there 's's overhead there you're going to be paying some overhead in um transaction processing
[1160.76 → 1166.68] fees so with credit cards that can be as much as like greater than one percent so you can be you can be
[1166.68 → 1173.16] eating it there uh you are you're taking up shelf space you're paying actual you know rent to store
[1173.16 → 1177.96] these things yep uh you're going to get some returns it's pretty typical even verified actual gamer got
[1177.96 → 1181.88] somewhere in the neighbourhood of around two percent returns or people just cancelling orders and then
[1181.88 → 1186.28] we're just kind of sitting there going okay we came up with a system because the way verified actual
[1186.28 → 1193.48] gamer worked we had this um database of customers uh who wanted the cards uh so the people who were the
[1193.48 → 1196.84] next ones through the gauntlet we would just contact them and say hey you were the next one in the
[1196.84 → 1201.96] gauntlet uh someone ended up not wanting it here you go, but the point is that there's so much overhead
[1201.96 → 1207.88] that if you could have a single customer take that whole thing pay by wire instead of credit
[1207.88 → 1212.76] card you've got that money immediately there's no worrying about chargeback like friendly fraud
[1212.76 → 1216.76] anything like that your agreement that they can't do any returns so I understand why they do it
[1216.76 → 1224.44] but it's really and right the big bigger issue is there are no consequences no outside of
[1225.08 → 1229.80] shaming that takes place on social media like which they don't care about at all just to be very
[1229.80 → 1234.76] clear oh yeah retailers don't the manufacturer is the one that ends up looking bad when some mining
[1234.76 → 1240.36] operation posts a picture of the 60 graphics cards that they just picked up right like a lot more or a
[1240.36 → 1246.76] a lot more than that um, so there 's's really there's been pictures there are no consequences
[1246.76 → 1252.68] somebody rolls up their garage, and it's literally just full of PlayStation 5s and like if there's is
[1252.68 → 1260.68] there's basically any genuine effort and there isn't effort from either retailers or Sony or whatever
[1260.68 → 1265.64] to do the other side like if the only amount of effort coming from the people selling it that aren't
[1265.64 → 1271.00] scalpers is to stop scalpers that kind of stuff wouldn't happen because no individual person should
[1271.00 → 1275.80] be able to get their hands on like tens or hundreds of these things and to be clear when we say they
[1275.80 → 1280.44] shouldn't be able to we don't mean legally they shouldn't be able to there's a lot of people calling
[1280.44 → 1287.24] for laws against scalping but coming back to my earlier point what is the really sticky what is the
[1287.24 → 1295.56] difference between a retailer and a scalper and there's also like how do you differentiate between
[1295.56 → 1301.32] like you buy something you use it you enjoy if it's not a return because it's not broken and now
[1301.32 → 1306.44] you want to sell it which should be completely allowed and how would you how would you enforce
[1306.44 → 1311.72] that yeah you could say okay there's also stores that literally just function that way yeah there's
[1311.72 → 1318.12] a lot of i I used to I used to work in produce um and one of the local sushi shops would walk in and
[1318.12 → 1324.84] like load up on groceries and then go effectively sell it by turning it into food like how do you
[1325.88 → 1329.72] that's kind of basic, but there's also places that'll go buy stuff from Costco and resell it in
[1329.72 → 1335.96] their own stores like water bottles a lot of gas stations just buy like drinks from Costco I mean
[1335.96 → 1341.08] Costco has a business membership like for that so what's the what's the difference now Dave juror says
[1341.08 → 1349.16] in the U.S. there are laws against it with certain items well yeah but a PlayStation 5 is not essential
[1349.16 → 1355.52] I don't think anybody is going to make that argument okay yeah like there are anti-scalping anti-hor
[1355.52 → 1363.04] laws that do exist and right because that came into play with like the alcohol cleaning stuff
[1363.04 → 1369.92] and all the same exact covid yeah exactly yeah but as long as it's as long as it's a non-essential
[1369.92 → 1374.00] item like a game console i really don't think you're going to win that battle and honestly
[1374.00 → 1380.72] I don't think it's the right answer the right answer is for everybody to just not pay the higher
[1380.72 → 1389.68] price yeah but unless you can get all of humanity to get together and cooperate on that which it's not
[1389.68 → 1394.24] going to happen is not going to happen there's just there really just is nothing that can be done about
[1394.24 → 1399.36] it so back to my original point you know what I've kind of I've kind of come around back to my original
[1399.36 → 1408.08] point I say it might as well be the retailer i I think it's kind of moot because of the as
[1408.08 → 1412.80] as long as people are going to pay whatever, and they're going to pay whatever yeah then it just
[1412.80 → 1416.96] doesn't even really matter john wick says other stores like EB games require you to buy at least
[1416.96 → 1421.36] a hundred dollars of other stuff when you purchase your PS5 from them, I think that's more reasonable
[1421.36 → 1427.52] because uh oh Conrad oh yeah Conrad change your username it's confusing yeah uh Conrad's one of the
[1427.52 → 1433.36] float plane stuff anyway the point is that I think that's a lot more reasonable because I think that
[1433.36 → 1439.12] when you're buying a console you're pretty likely to need like a game and a second controller or
[1439.12 → 1446.72] something like that like it's its unfortunate that best buy is okay now I've come I've come back around
[1446.72 → 1454.72] again I've 180'd again I wouldn't mind a more uh who was it who was doing that uh sorry I lost your
[1454.72 → 1459.44] message Conrad uh EB games apparently I wouldn't mind something like that like look you got to
[1459.44 → 1466.72] purchase something else as well but making you buy effectively the extended warranty is pretty crappy
[1467.28 → 1474.48] so what they're doing isn't wrong it's not illegal it's just crappy and if you don't like it than you
[1474.48 → 1481.12] should stop shopping at Best Buy shop somewhere else yeah um vote with your wallet uh I mean you can
[1481.12 → 1487.52] Sony is apparently offering the opportunity to purchase a PlayStation 5 console directly so
[1487.52 → 1491.60] they've set up a website for that I mean this makes a ton of sense to me again I would rather
[1491.60 → 1497.60] see the manufacturer take the additional value yeah um oh I don't think you're paying for it
[1499.60 → 1507.28] no you are you're paying MSRP yeah, but that means that Sony is taking whatever margin there would
[1507.28 → 1514.32] have been for Best Buy yeah, yeah sorry yeah yeah um all right well I think that's pretty much all i
[1514.32 → 1519.36] have to say about that and yeah nick has a comment that it's kind of similar to what's happening with
[1519.36 → 1527.28] GPUs because like the MSRP for GPUs is just creeping slowly not even that slowly I guess um and not
[1527.28 → 1532.16] even really creeping it's its sprinting forward uh people even mentioned on the last verified actual
[1532.16 → 1538.64] GameStop they're like wow I mean it's at MSRP, but it's like pretty expensive, and it's like yeah
[1538.64 → 1545.20] because the MSRP went up well something people might not realize is I've I've seen uh I'm
[1545.20 → 1552.80] not going to name any names so let's just say an uh a GPU chipset maker, so this is either AMD or NVIDIA
[1553.52 → 1561.12] but I have seen them announce a MSRP and then I've heard from board partners through the grapevine
[1561.12 → 1566.48] that even though the board partners are still expected to hit that MSRP somehow magically
[1566.48 → 1572.16] and even though the media never get any kind of update that the MSRP has changed I've heard about
[1572.16 → 1578.64] those chipsets getting more expensive to the board partners and then basically just these chipset
[1578.64 → 1583.44] manufacturers or not even manufacturers designers because they're all manufactured by Samsung or TSMC or
[1583.44 → 1590.80] global founders or whatever these designers be it AMD or NVIDIA basically just sit there and
[1590.80 → 1597.52] let their partners take the flack just act as a meat shield while they sit and extract more value
[1597.52 → 1603.04] out of their partners and because they're all bound by NDAs that are not just NDAs there's a lot more than
[1603.04 → 1609.20] the legal ramifications of leaking information from a partner like AMD or NVIDIA like they will
[1609.20 → 1614.96] they will cut your allocation they're not obligated to sell you GPUs they could sell them to somebody else
[1614.96 → 1618.88] they will cut your they will cut your allocation they will destroy your business, and they can do it
[1618.88 → 1626.40] overnight, and they'll, they can be vindictive about it like oh man the GPU industry is so weird it's
[1627.12 → 1633.12] super weird what they really need is collective bargaining like if is all the GPU board partners
[1633.12 → 1641.84] got together and were like look we are not going to accept three percent profit margins any more we are
[1641.84 → 1648.00] not going to hit your MSRP I don't know if it would matter I think it would well okay so it wouldn't
[1648.00 → 1654.16] matter because they would never all get together and do that okay for one yeah but for two i genuinely
[1654.16 → 1659.60] think especially NVIDIA honestly I could see AMD wanting to play ball more but especially NVIDIA i
[1659.60 → 1665.20] feel like would get so cheesed about that that their immediate response would just be like we're not
[1665.20 → 1668.64] working with board partners any more we're just going to make all our own GPUs get right yeah it would
[1668.64 → 1674.64] take them a while to build up the capacity to do that it's, and it's clear that that's been the
[1674.64 → 1678.48] direction that they've been moving for a number of years definitely thinking about making themselves
[1678.48 → 1683.76] less dependent on board partners um, and it's kind of funny because you say you couldn't imagine AMD
[1683.76 → 1688.48] doing that but that actually used to be AMD's model like AMD used to compete directly with their own
[1688.48 → 1695.28] board partners back in the remember BBA cards I just wouldn't see AMD get as vindictive about it well
[1695.28 → 1699.60] that's because AMD doesn't have the option to get as vindictive nobody needs them as badly it's
[1699.60 → 1707.52] probably true like come on I mean i i I look I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not trying to throw any
[1707.52 → 1712.96] shade or anything like that the truth of the matter is that NVIDIA's partners whether it's through
[1712.96 → 1721.52] NVIDIA's actions or through their own actions are a fair bit more dependent on NVIDIA and um it's a lot
[1721.52 → 1728.16] more lucrative to be engaged with NVIDIA on that GPU business than it is to be engaged with AMD they
[1728.16 → 1735.92] just sell so many more cards so even if NVIDIA is squeezing you, and you're only making you know four
[1735.92 → 1742.00] points on the board let's say AMD could offer you six points because remember AMD still has to have
[1742.00 → 1747.52] that street price competitive with NVIDIA, and they have their own costs right it costs to get the chips
[1747.52 → 1752.72] fad they have to buy memory right yeah they have their own costs right so even if AMD could
[1752.72 → 1759.20] get you more margin if NVIDIA boards are out selling AMD boards four to one which is about what it is
[1759.20 → 1763.44] is that it I thought it was even worse than that no I think they're at about 80 market share for
[1763.44 → 1767.52] discrete GPU right now don't quote me on that because it does tend to kind of shift around also how
[1767.52 → 1772.16] are you how are you measuring that are you just doing gamers are you doing like steam survey that's
[1772.16 → 1779.28] really all you can go on because right now it's honestly however much can be produced yes but
[1779.28 → 1785.92] NVIDIA books way more capacity than AMD because they sell way more GPUs than AMD it's that simple yeah
[1787.20 → 1792.24] um speaking of wanting to sell way more things you want to talk about the Facebook live audio room with
[1792.24 → 1800.00] intel execs yeah so that was really refreshing today it's been a long time since I remember man I'm gonna
[1800.00 → 1806.32] hopefully I'm not going to get anybody in trouble but I had uh, uh mike my one of my contacts at intel
[1806.32 → 1810.80] Agnes I actually haven't talked to her in forever uh the last time I talked to her, I was like kind of
[1810.80 → 1821.20] beating her up because I was like look you guys have a PR problem because you guys are so determined to be
[1821.20 → 1829.12] professional that you've lost any semblance of humanity whatsoever you guys are a nameless faceless
[1829.12 → 1834.40] organization that nobody cares about because you try so hard to be a nameless faceless organization
[1834.40 → 1842.72] that nobody cares about um and basically i I forget what I had wanted to do oh I remember what this
[1842.72 → 1848.96] was around the time that they had that benchmarking scandal where they worked with the third party
[1848.96 → 1856.08] or something to produce benchmarks for them that were like clearly very misleading and then they
[1856.08 → 1864.88] issued this total non-apology and I was like no you guys need to get a human face out there you need
[1864.88 → 1871.92] to actually apologize like you actually mean it, and you got you gotta stop being so stuffy right
[1871.92 → 1878.88] so i was giving her heck about it because I was like it's its you guys are impossible to work
[1878.88 → 1887.04] with right now because everyone just looks bad you guys look bad now I look bad and at the end of the
[1887.04 → 1892.48] day, and you know she was neither able to confirm nor deny this but at the end of the day as far as i
[1892.48 → 1899.68] could tell it was gross incompetence not any actual wilful they've been so wilfully misleading behaviour
[1899.68 → 1904.88] so long and I know I've brought this up actually like probably double-digit amount of times on Sancho yeah
[1904.88 → 1909.84] yeah I there's that there's that scenario where I talked about how they pulled out of conventions
[1909.84 → 1914.32] yes because they're like oh we don't see the ROI in it, they've just been so disconnected from like
[1914.32 → 1920.08] people for so long it's been ridiculous so that was one of the last conversations I actually had with
[1920.08 → 1927.04] Agnes and i I mean she wasn't able to confirm or deny this because I know how it is but my belief
[1927.04 → 1932.64] is that the reason they didn't ultimately issue an apology is because issuing an apology is the same as
[1932.64 → 1938.72] saying MIA culpa it's its admitting you did something wrong and admitting you did something
[1938.72 → 1942.48] wrong to your customers well that's human that's how you engage with your customers that's how you
[1942.48 → 1948.64] build a relationship that's how you build trust right admitting you're wrong from a legal standpoint
[1949.44 → 1955.36] not great now you're opening yourself up to lawsuits so my belief is that what happened there
[1955.36 → 1962.32] was a case of gross utter incompetence not from the engineers it must have been an exec level person
[1963.20 → 1969.28] again she could not get any kind of confirmation um and then what I suspect is that the lawyers
[1969.28 → 1974.64] came in and said whoa we just need this to quietly go away without us actually saying we did anything
[1974.64 → 1980.16] wrong because if we do that all of a sudden we could be opening ourselves up to all kinds of legal action
[1980.16 → 1986.72] that's what I believe happened, and it doesn't change that just makes you look like this
[1986.72 → 1995.20] personalityless super slime like emotionless monster right yeah a bunch of suits so had a really
[1995.20 → 2001.36] refreshing conversation today we did these uh we've done six now actually I thought was the last one we
[2001.36 → 2008.88] did six of these Facebook live audio rooms um as a partnership with Facebook and uh we did uh some
[2008.88 → 2014.40] perfect ones Luke and I did our favourite games we did one with Wendell Linux then now in the future
[2014.96 → 2021.44] um did a really great one with um jams and Brian the electrician sort of talking about should you let
[2021.44 → 2027.92] your kids use tech what's our policies and the one today was is Moore's law dead and intel actually
[2027.92 → 2034.00] managed to get me two VP level executives and Agnes was there that's why I brought her up because she
[2034.00 → 2038.64] was there presumably to supervise, but she didn't she didn't she didn't step in she didn't say anything
[2038.64 → 2045.36] uh but I had two VP level execs, and basically they were like yeah we want to talk to you as humans
[2046.08 → 2053.20] and then they did cool, and it was great because I mean i I tweeted about this without actually I've never
[2053.20 → 2059.12] met pat galsinger excuse me I've never met pat he's the new CEO of intel as of about six
[2059.12 → 2066.96] months ago um all I knew was as soon as I saw the appointment I knew that he had a background as an
[2066.96 → 2072.72] engineer and that made me really excited because intel's previous CEO was an accounting background
[2073.36 → 2081.68] and that sucks that's not how you that's not how you drive passion and a product focused culture
[2081.68 → 2087.44] you need to have someone who actually understands what you are doing not just who you sell it to
[2087.44 → 2093.92] but what you make, and so I was really excited and I tweeted I was like thank you know what does
[2093.92 → 2101.68] your competition who's killing it right now all have in common NVIDIA engineering background CEO AMD
[2102.32 → 2107.28] engineering background CEO it's almost like there's a pattern and I was like I was extremely excited about
[2107.28 → 2112.80] it and when I was talking to these guys today uh one of the things I asked them was told me a story
[2113.36 → 2120.16] tell me a story that illustrates to you how the last six months have been a turning point for intel
[2120.16 → 2124.88] and how people are more excited about what they're doing and uh one of them came back to me and they
[2124.88 → 2133.68] were like well okay here's something um i I brought this proposal to pat and my boss, and it was this
[2133.68 → 2139.20] like huge undertaking um you know obviously it's all it's all nd8 at this point what it is couldn't
[2139.20 → 2145.76] couldn't say exactly what it was, but it's this huge undertaking and the reading between the lines
[2146.32 → 2152.64] going to be really expensive and I basically said okay, and it's going to take us here's what we're going to do
[2152.64 → 2161.52] and he was listening rapturously and uh I finished up, and he basically said wow I really like
[2161.52 → 2169.28] it that sounds really exciting but I want it two years earlier and I'm like thank you yeah, and he's
[2169.28 → 2173.84] like put more pressure behind it, and he's like yeah my team loves that kind of pressure, and it's
[2173.84 → 2180.32] refreshing yeah to have that kind of that kind of pressure where it's not you know what the right
[2180.32 → 2187.04] business thing to do might not be to build it two years faster because time is money and when you want
[2187.04 → 2192.24] more time you got to pay money, and you know both of them were they were human, but they were still
[2192.24 → 2197.92] very professional these guys obviously didn't reach VP level in a company like intel without learning to
[2198.56 → 2204.08] learning to talk around yeah learning to speak corporate speak a little bit, but the good news is
[2204.08 → 2210.00] that you know I'm familiar enough with that manner of communication that I can see it and I can go okay
[2210.00 → 2215.60] so what you're saying is there's this willingness to invest in technology for the sake of building cool
[2215.60 → 2222.80] stuff and doing it now which is how you get really intense fans well yeah and those really intense
[2222.80 → 2228.16] fans is how you sell lots of stuff because we've talked about this before lots of like friend groups
[2228.16 → 2233.36] or family units will have like v tech person and everyone in that friend group or family unit will
[2233.36 → 2238.16] just do what that person says and not just do what that person says you got to understand that at the
[2238.16 → 2244.72] enthusiast level right even though intel's market share in the debt in the broader desktop space
[2244.72 → 2250.24] might still be excellent because they can just produce more than AMD in the enthusiast space
[2251.68 → 2256.16] it's we've seen reports coming out of retailers in Europe that have basically said yeah like intel
[2256.16 → 2262.80] and b like neck and neck or even that AMD is out ahead, and it's more than just what those enthusiasts
[2262.80 → 2269.12] say I mean it's what those enthusiasts have experience with that it is trust right like if you have AMD
[2269.12 → 2277.68] in your system, and you're like yeah uh you know the 10 8 50k or whatever is a perfect deal right now
[2277.68 → 2282.56] uh because you know intel clearly has a fire lit under their butt to move these things and stay
[2282.56 → 2287.52] competitive I'm going to go well look I'm not that budget constrained I don't mind spending an extra
[2287.52 → 2292.00] 30 dollars which in the grand scheme of buying a new gaming machine is not that much money what do you run
[2293.12 → 2298.00] that's how that conversation goes that's what they want to know they don't want to know what's a good bang for the buck that i
[2298.00 → 2302.64] calculate on a spreadsheet they want to know what are you running and like the biggest problem I think
[2302.64 → 2307.76] when dozens were we're starting to kind of hit the scene in the beginning yeah was a lot of people
[2307.76 → 2316.40] that have used intel for many years potentially their whole lives yeah um were worried about like am I now
[2316.40 → 2321.04] going to have problems because CPUs are generally not something that you really have a problem with right
[2321.04 → 2326.24] so you went like I'm taking this piece of my system that has been rock solid yeah for years and I'm
[2326.24 → 2329.84] replacing it with some different brand is this going to be an issue and it I think that was the
[2329.84 → 2334.96] the biggest problem with dozen adoption for a long time was they needed to show everyone like no we're cool
[2334.96 → 2339.44] this is well gen one was also kind of a piece of food for a while it's also not amazing but they
[2339.44 → 2345.12] figured it out um and so yeah like brand loyalty especially with something that doesn't have a lot of
[2345.12 → 2351.36] problems it's tough to overtake like if there's something in your life that you have a version of it
[2351.36 → 2355.76] and it works completely fine yeah and a very reasonable amount of time in the future you need
[2355.76 → 2362.72] another version you're very likely to just go back by the new one yeah I like i7 I'll have the latest i7
[2363.28 → 2368.48] yeah done yep yeah and that that's true across like a huge range of things it's not just computer
[2368.48 → 2375.84] components absolutely like for example i I like telling you about our sponsors yeah i you know i I get
[2375.84 → 2379.92] I get one sponsor and I think gee that was a good sponsor I think I'll do it again I'll have another please
[2379.92 → 2388.80] all right let's talk about LG's ultra gear gp9 gaming speaker let me tell you this thing is not
[2388.80 → 2397.44] cheap okay not cheap, but it's actually legitimately really cool so it's got an es9038 pro quad deck
[2398.56 → 2404.00] plugging into it with headphones so okay the main jam of it is that it acts as kind of like a gaming sound
[2404.00 → 2410.48] bar but with surprisingly good positional audio and then plugging into it with headphones I was
[2410.48 → 2417.12] actually really impressed again by how accurate the positional audio is out of this thing
[2417.12 → 2424.08] there's EQ customization through the boom LG app for iOS and android it's got RGB lighting of course
[2424.08 → 2428.32] it allows you to quickly and conveniently switch between the speaker and headphones just with a
[2428.32 → 2434.16] single button it's got Bluetooth so if you want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker you can also do that
[2434.16 → 2439.84] and it features echo cancellation and noise cancellation so if you've got your game
[2439.84 → 2443.76] running through it oops I turned it on if you've got your game running through it oh well there's
[2443.76 → 2448.56] there's the RGB lighting um apparently it's battery based you can still talk to someone through it you
[2448.56 → 2452.96] can still use it for your comes, and it actually does an outstanding job we did a short circuit on this
[2452.96 → 2457.28] recently uh it does an outstanding job of blocking everything out so you guys can check that out
[2457.28 → 2462.40] at the link down below the show is also brought to you by tux care thank you tux care does your

[2563.28 → 2569.52] already then good to know yeah what else do we want to talk about today Luke um pixel 6 and pixel
[2569.52 → 2578.80] pass yeah hit me google is working on a subscription service called pixel pass um it bundles a pixel
[2578.80 → 2585.28] subscription service I'll pass okay sorry I don't know it might be good it bundles a pixel phone with
[2585.28 → 2592.40] a collection of Google services YouTube premium uh slash music because it's one thing uh google one i
[2592.40 → 2597.04] literally have no idea what that is I forget because I don't care but I definitely knew what
[2597.04 → 2603.76] it was at some point let me double-check uh play pass which is like games on your android phone and
[2603.76 → 2609.20] google phi uh what's notably missing is stadia and google TV that's a little awkward it would be nice if
[2609.20 → 2615.76] it had stadia on it um really so you can play so many stadia it would feel more rounded out so you can
[2615.76 → 2620.96] play all four games on stadia considering it has considered it has considered it has play pass it
[2620.96 → 2625.44] would feel more rounded out I wouldn't really want to use it, but that's that's its own thing uh no word
[2625.44 → 2632.64] on pricing yet and i I believe I don't see the answer to this in here but i I think you get I think the
[2632.64 → 2641.92] whole idea is that you get a pixel right uh yeah like I don't think it oh it there it is I didn't read
[2641.92 → 2647.52] this line it bundles a pixel phone with all those services got it yeah so google one is basically
[2647.52 → 2655.60] cloud storage and google phi is their like um cell phone service right yeah yeah it's a phone plan
[2655.60 → 2662.08] so you're getting a phone plan storage some mobile games YouTube premium YouTube music
[2663.36 → 2670.16] yeah I don't know, and you get to keep paying for your phone yep over time I mean I guess if you were
[2670.16 → 2673.84] already going to subscribe to a bunch of those services anyway it's not the stupidest thing ever
[2673.84 → 2680.56] it's really not that different yeah than a normal phone plan though it's a normal phone plan plus
[2681.52 → 2687.28] extra steps play pass and google one and YouTube premium that being said google phi for the short
[2687.28 → 2691.36] period of time that I used it because it ended up being cheaper when I was on the road than an
[2691.36 → 2697.04] alternative service like buying a local sim so I had a very, very temporary google phi it was perfect
[2697.04 → 2701.84] okay it was genuinely perfect so I don't know whose towers it's on though Google doesn't have
[2701.84 → 2708.96] their own so I was in Taiwan so I have no idea there okay well shows you what I know then uh and
[2708.96 → 2715.20] in the states I'm not sure um so like your service is going to be its own thing I was also going to say
[2715.20 → 2720.32] what was really nice about it was I could like to pause the service or cancel the service whenever but this
[2720.32 → 2725.52] is probably not the case on a pixel pass so you kind of lose that flexibility I'm assuming here's the pixel
[2725.52 → 2732.40] six page that was leaked smarter chip boost to camera magic with tensor cores probably totally
[2732.40 → 2740.16] worked unreleased just like almost every other one hey roasted boom roasted google partners with T-Mobile
[2740.16 → 2745.36] in the US okay, okay there you go I don't think it's a thing in Canada if I'm real quick all day battery life
[2745.36 → 2755.84] i have to say battery life is one thing that is borderline on the fold I will very regularly be
[2755.84 → 2761.76] extremely close to the end of my battery at the end of the day with that said I have it set to 85
[2761.76 → 2768.32] maximum charge so that I am hopefully going to retain that what little capacity I have for as long
[2768.32 → 2773.60] as possible, but this is with me usually plugging it into my car on the way to and from work so the fact
[2773.60 → 2778.00] that we're so close and I'm actually giving it probably about 10 worth of juice throughout the
[2778.00 → 2788.64] day is pretty uh pretty tough uh Qualcomm this is in our notes here Qualcomm is apparently
[2789.28 → 2797.44] um mad bra that another yet another company is making smartphone SOCS rather than just using snapdragon i
[2797.44 → 2802.08] mean if Qualcomm doesn't like it maybe they should have um you know been more consistent
[2802.08 → 2806.64] about delivering big performance improvements year after year before we jump there I was trying to find
[2806.64 → 2812.80] this um i i I was surprised it wasn't in the dock and then I guess I forgot about it, I'm going to throw
[2812.80 → 2818.72] it at the very top of the dock right below the next wan show thing right above yeah you'll see it
[2818.72 → 2827.12] screen rant Nokia 6310 a new version of the unbreakable brick phone wait sorry i I tuned out for a
[2827.12 → 2835.84] second here because this is hilarious um the snapdragon uh the Qualcomm tweet about this is we've
[2835.84 → 2841.36] decided to make our own smartphone SOC instead of using snapdragon, and then it's this uh this
[2841.36 → 2848.08] Twitter trend where you put a bunch of red flags, and it's like well yeah, but the problem is that you
[2848.08 → 2856.32] guys have been a big part of the reason that android gets such crappy post sales support so um
[2856.80 → 2862.88] apparently the tensor chip that google is using is going to allow to google google to provide five
[2862.88 → 2870.88] years of updates which it's about freaking time because android has looked stupid compared to what
[2870.88 → 2878.64] apple provides for iOS devices for years now I mean horst did a Jonathan horst uh who's our host for mac
[2878.64 → 2888.24] address did a video recently where he installed the latest iOS on an iPhone SE like that's insane
[2888.24 → 2893.28] that is pretty intense where do you find this talk that's insane you know that phone okay that um
[2893.92 → 2899.68] that that little phone that we used to use for the FLIR thermal camera the little clip-in
[2899.68 → 2905.12] lightning one yeah back when you were still working as a writer okay that phone can run the latest version
[2905.12 → 2909.84] run the latest version of iOS we still have it that is pretty sweet that's insane yeah
[2912.56 → 2917.36] oh this is in here okay all right sorry what were you talking about no KIA phone I was trying to find
[2917.36 → 2920.56] this topic the whole time so I was trying to figure what you're talking about I didn't realize it was the
[2920.56 → 2928.16] same thing okay yeah go to the very top of the dock yeah oh no what do we get here it's amazing the
[2928.16 → 2934.32] 6310 brick phone is back, and it got a facelift so is this running android or what I think so but it
[2934.32 → 2944.08] comes with snake tired of powerful smartphones that can do everything oh my goodness all right I mean ah
[2944.08 → 2949.04] people keep saying for those who long for simpler times Nokia has something just for you but yeah but
[2949.60 → 2955.68] the Nokia brand was bought out like who even owns the Nokia brand Nokia is not doing anything if you
[2955.68 → 2963.76] think of it as like the Nokia that used to do stuff who bought Nokia brand phone, and it's also just like
[2963.76 → 2975.76] kind of garbage uh HMD global of whatever HMD global of is that's 16 mega megabytes of ram like
[2975.76 → 2983.68] what who does HMD global own key people brands okay they own Nokia it doesn't say it doesn't say
[2983.68 → 2991.12] what else so they've added some new features such as the ability to zoom on menus for easier readability
[2991.12 → 2998.08] and wireless FM radio hey FM radio that's the future right there I was gonna I was gonna challenge
[2998.08 → 3003.84] you to do like a like one week I switched or something, but honestly it just seems too terrible
[3003.84 → 3009.44] yeah I mean I could, it might be an interesting video but I don't think I will no yeah speaking
[3009.44 → 3016.08] of things I don't think I'll do I don't think I will dodge the controversy around our Havana build
[3016.08 → 3023.44] okay yeah tell me about it so do you know who nope Havana is nope okay so i think when we
[3023.44 → 3029.76] went live uh he was actually live on twitch so i he's probably still live that was only like
[3029.76 → 3035.04] an hour oh I don't know his full name I guess this is Hasan the twitch streamer yes okay yeah yeah
[3035.04 → 3044.24] yeah, although that's just sorry Havana is just his handle so yes Hasan um we uh sort of randomly
[3044.24 → 3051.52] kind of hooked up over twitter when he was like yo I need a pc and I was like sure why not and
[3051.52 → 3061.92] so we decided for fun that we wanted to make the most left pc the most left-leaning pc and so far on
[3061.92 → 3069.36] float plane it has managed to generate a significant amount of controversy I think that this is one of
[3069.36 → 3076.88] the worst like dislike ratios that I have ever seen on a video on float plane and a lot of the
[3076.88 → 3087.68] controversy seems to be because people um find Hasan to be a very polarizing figure okay and or they think
[3087.68 → 3095.92] that we are kind of taking a stand that really our intention was never to take now obviously if we're
[3095.92 → 3102.48] building a pc for Hasan it's going to be Hasan themed so you can see that we've got this um
[3102.48 → 3110.80] wonderful hammer and sickle oh wow decal for the front oh my the colour scheme is red oh my obviously
[3111.36 → 3117.52] and we've got this delightful side panel graphic that the one and only Sarah butt created for us, we've got
[3117.52 → 3123.68] Jeff Bezos on a plate with some broccoli it's good for you um wait he's a twitch streamer though
[3125.92 → 3130.72] I mean I don't know anything about this dude I know that he like exists I know his name that's it
[3130.72 → 3137.28] i I don't know there's a there's a weird dichotomy going on here though because he's just like
[3137.28 → 3143.44] theoretically a pretty huge amount of his efforts is just making Bezos richer uh yes
[3145.12 → 3153.28] um I think i I want to think that he's aware of the irony of that yeah okay um I don't know i yeah
[3153.28 → 3159.68] sure yeah so I guess I just want to kind of get out ahead of this and say look the point of this
[3159.68 → 3170.16] video is to have some fun uh the point of this video is to make a pc for a prominent creator um we
[3170.16 → 3179.36] kind of take some shots at both sides you know we uh we're just can we just here can we just all be
[3179.36 → 3188.96] friends can we just build a pc for someone, and you know kind of take some shots at their viewpoints
[3188.96 → 3195.84] take some shots at the other viewpoints you know and so you shot at both sides, so just everyone hates
[3195.84 → 3204.64] it is that what's going on is that what's happening you're the enemy of everyone I like it
[3204.64 → 3212.56] that's good I'm probably going to enjoy this video I haven't seen it, yet that's fantastic
[3214.64 → 3221.52] oh man yeah so we should have I mean i guess maybe wait no I don't like it I've stopped
[3221.52 → 3229.76] my float plane membership over this no stop come back yeah please come back please come back we
[3229.76 → 3238.16] still we really need you um we need you float plane oh yeah I don't know man I mean
[3238.16 → 3242.56] it's just it's one of those things where i I understand there's nothing we're going to be able
[3242.56 → 3248.24] to do to make everyone happy so I guess we're just going to make everyone unhappy while we're at it
[3248.24 → 3253.76] maybe i I don't know what's next the Ben Shapiro pc like what would be what would be an equivalent
[3253.76 → 3261.12] the the the know we make it out of uh we make it out of that one piece of wood
[3261.12 → 3268.08] from Home Depot this is good this is going to be not please try not to get us cancelled Luke
[3268.08 → 3271.52] I think so you can water cool it with ivermectin
[3285.92 → 3290.72] anyway oh man
[3290.72 → 3302.00] all right I guess that's uh I guess that's pretty much if you know geomaster337 says what
[3302.00 → 3308.88] about the trump pc throwback to tech showdown you know what's funny is I actually tried many times
[3308.88 → 3315.36] to get a trump pc off the ground internally I wanted to do I wanted to do just the
[3315.36 → 3326.00] the gaudiest tackiest all white and gold pc and then for part two I wanted to attempt to hand
[3326.00 → 3333.12] deliver it to the White House that was that was my that was my plan I wanted to do it nick
[3333.12 → 3342.00] would not allow it he was like no I'm like look we don't have to take a stance and for that matter you
[3342.00 → 3348.88] know when there's a democratic president I'd happily build a pc for them as well I don't care
[3348.88 → 3356.00] for me, it was just like the fact that it would be so easy to build a themed pc around that guy
[3357.04 → 3362.40] just like oh man like it would just have to be like the front of it you can picture it right like
[3362.40 → 3368.64] it would have to be the tallest pc with the biggest letters you know like it would just be it would just
[3368.64 → 3374.64] be hilarious yeah it would have been hilarious it would have been it would have been huge and nick
[3374.64 → 3383.76] was like absolutely not uh Joel and true says Nick is smart you should listen to him, he did i did
[3383.76 → 3391.52] I did listen to i did sometimes listen Linus takes counsel not always sometimes look i I understand
[3391.52 → 3401.76] that my kind of irreverent sense of humour is not shared by other people oh man oh I think yeah I think
[3401.76 → 3407.92] there's also yeah I don't know this video is going to be interesting to watch yeah are you guys gonna is it
[3407.92 → 3412.56] going to YouTube yeah it's going to YouTube I'm not going to back down I'm not going to back down it's uh
[3413.28 → 3420.40] it's going to YouTube it's its it's the left leaning pc it literally leans to the left we took two of the
[3420.40 → 3428.32] feet off, and we are not shipping Hasan the feet like there's no there's no haha just kidding go ahead
[3428.32 → 3434.08] and put the feet back on oh that's this is literally like a five thousand six thousand dollar computer
[3434.08 → 3444.00] that is missing two of the feet on the case oh my goodness that's so funny um there's going to be some
[3444.00 → 3450.72] inconveniences when Hasan gets it there's going to be some stuff that like is not the best I don't know
[3450.72 → 3457.20] that he has the technical know-how to fix it for example every time you boot it up you get to listen
[3457.20 → 3461.84] to not just a little bit of but the entire Soviet Union national anthem
[3466.08 → 3473.68] if you try to cancel it uh your Windows explorer will not load, and you will have to reboot your computer
[3473.68 → 3480.96] and sit through it oh my goodness uh oh man i I don't want to spoil too much, but there's a macro
[3480.96 → 3484.96] you should have made it so that there was a power bar like built into the computer so that it had to
[3484.96 → 3491.52] share the power that it received um what there is a pre-installed folding at home instance
[3492.08 → 3495.60] so you can share your CPU yes okay
[3498.88 → 3503.36] that's funny uh I think I'm going to enjoy this video I think it's going to be funny yeah I think I can
[3503.36 → 3509.52] understand in the current political climate how people are you know edgy a little edgy about it
[3509.52 → 3516.40] just all I'm going to ask is just try to watch it with a sense of humour instead of trying to watch it with
[3516.40 → 3523.84] like uh, uh hating everyone and everything kind of thing like i just I don't need to be
[3523.84 → 3532.16] cancelled over this I just was like hey the leftist pc that's kind of a funny theme for a build let's do it
[3532.16 → 3539.04] and um you know i I didn't I didn't really like to learn much about Hassan I had one call with him
[3539.04 → 3544.32] where i kind of talked through his tech plan um but like that was kind of the extent of it
[3544.32 → 3548.48] I was like this seems like a pretty cool theme for a build let's do it and for better or for worse
[3549.04 → 3556.96] it's did he know the theme uh yeah yeah yeah I don't think he knew quite the extent of it
[3556.96 → 3563.52] like I told him that it might have two left side panels on it so like one of them might have fitment
[3563.52 → 3574.08] issues I didn't tell him the whole thing was going to like sit crooked oh my goodness that's uh man
[3575.20 → 3584.32] that's exciting yeah log one x says we need the Ben Shapiro pc I mean yeah i I don't know I don't know
[3584.32 → 3590.32] what anybody needs i I'm not the doctor I don't have the right prescription for you all right uh
[3590.32 → 3596.32] what else we got in terms of topics oh this is a pretty big topic um Ltd store we don't have any
[3596.32 → 3601.92] new product launches this week or anything crazy like that so just reminder we got great mouse pads
[3601.92 → 3607.84] by the way Luke I am so grateful that you guys finally got reviews working on the site uh because
[3607.84 → 3614.80] check this out we have over two thousand five-star reviews for the northern lights desk pad did you
[3614.80 → 3622.24] have any idea no actually that's huge we have sold a couple desk pads just a few just a few yeah 2 000
[3622.24 → 3630.64] reviews but uh what we do have is an announcement we are starting a newsletter and um nick and I got
[3630.64 → 3637.04] together and basically said okay how do we make this newsletter not crappy now obviously in a newsletter
[3637.04 → 3642.48] you can have you know discounts, or you can have announcements for new products or whatever else
[3642.48 → 3648.56] but that's just marketing and I don't see us as a marketing company I see us as a content company
[3648.56 → 3656.00] and the way that we market is by making great content that people want to watch and people want to
[3656.64 → 3661.12] uh you know share in the experiences that we're having and if they see us going like oh yeah gee that
[3661.12 → 3664.88] does seem like a perfect way to keep your water cold and stay hydrated they're gonna they're going to buy
[3664.88 → 3668.88] the water bottle they're going to trust us to do a great job of all the things we do like the way
[3668.88 → 3676.40] that we the way that we market is by just making quality whatever it is that we do right and so i
[3676.40 → 3682.24] was like yeah look i just I don't I think it's fine for us to have things like product announcements but
[3682.24 → 3687.52] everyone signs up for those newsletters they do it for whatever incentive there is in the first place
[3687.52 → 3692.24] whether it's a 10 coupon code or whatever the case I was on the CX one, and then they immediately stop
[3692.24 → 3697.36] looking at them oh I kept looking at it well the NCI one was because you regularly bought computer
[3697.36 → 3703.68] hardware and the NCI newsletter was just the price sheet it just yeah it just told you when the price
[3703.68 → 3708.80] sheet was updated yeah, so anyway the point is like a lot of brand newsletters you sing up for them and
[3708.80 → 3714.24] then you stop reading them that's true and so what nick and I got together and tried to figure out was
[3714.24 → 3721.36] what can we do to make our newsletter not boring and the kind of thing that people should actually want
[3721.36 → 3728.96] to subscribe to, and it was like eureka content it should just be yet another content stream from
[3728.96 → 3736.08] Linus media group so guess what our newsletter is going to be I don't know there will be product
[3736.08 → 3742.16] announcements okay there will be offers and stuff like that but tell me most importantly it's
[3742.16 → 3748.40] going to be the inside scoop on what we're working on and so the first one is either has gone out or is
[3748.40 → 3755.36] about to go out and uh apparently we're calling it the leak okay well that's that's pretty cool because
[3755.36 → 3762.72] um maybe I guess this is based on how often i I leak the LTT store stuff I'm not sure uh but the point
[3762.72 → 3766.88] is hey guys uh product release notifications and discounts are cool, but they're also boring the goal
[3766.88 → 3773.04] of our newsletter the pre-release version of the leak to imager I guess so nice yeah don't worry about
[3773.04 → 3776.80] it the goal of our newsletter is to give you all a look behind the scenes, so this is going to be the first
[3776.80 → 3781.60] one uh you've probably seen the new wan hoodie hey I'm wearing it in videos from time to time but we
[3781.60 → 3786.08] haven't given you a detailed look, yet before you ask it's coming soon really, really soon when you're
[3786.08 → 3790.96] here when they're here you'll be the first to know, and we've got our first kind of detailed images of
[3790.96 → 3795.28] what the new hoodie is going to look like so it's what the store is working on yes it's what creator
[3795.28 → 3803.36] warehouse is working on then this is really cool um, so this is a lot of stuff will either be a long
[3803.36 → 3808.40] time or could never even see the light of day, but we work on all kinds of cool stuff I mean even down
[3808.40 → 3814.24] to the uh the systems that we're trying to build for embedding magnets in children's toys so that
[3814.24 → 3819.44] we can make the baby's first pc toy have you seen that thing apparently Hassan watched us talking
[3819.44 → 3824.48] about that oh that's hilarious that's funny anyway sorry um have I seen what sir have you seen
[3824.48 → 3830.00] that like baby's first pc thing I have you've been talking to me about this concept for like years but no
[3830.00 → 3833.92] I haven't Jacob has a prototype like near where you sit you should go ask him to see if it's
[3833.92 → 3838.88] pretty cool the point is that it uses magnets to snap all the parts into place so you can build a pc
[3839.76 → 3846.72] the problem is that kids toys are really, really challenging to make kids safe and magnets are
[3846.72 → 3853.92] extremely dangerous especially if they are like rare earth like strong magnets if they're ingested they can
[3853.92 → 3859.92] rip up your insides um and so what we have been doing is we've been doing a lot of r d on
[3859.92 → 3865.68] how to embed magnets in blocks really safely and that's the kind of thing that we never really get
[3865.68 → 3869.60] an opportunity to talk about we just eventually release the product, and we're like hey here's
[3869.60 → 3875.36] a product you can buy it but there's so much that we learn that we never teach you guys about and I'm
[3875.36 → 3879.92] looking at it going well this is wasted this is a wasted opportunity if we're going to learn this
[3879.92 → 3885.28] stuff we might as well talk about it so um the big one that I was really excited about for this week is
[3885.92 → 3896.80] the uh jacket that we're working on that uses 3d printed down fabric 3d printed down what right so
[3896.80 → 3900.80] natural down fabrics are known for their thermal insulation and their padding and this fabric is no
[3900.80 → 3905.76] different it's got a high CIO value so that describes the degree of insulation provided by a
[3905.76 → 3910.96] piece of clothing uh one CIO is about equal to the amount of clothing required by a resting human to
[3910.96 → 3915.28] maintain thermal comfort at room temperature it's relatively breathable, and it can be actually
[3915.28 → 3921.04] laminated with a membrane to make a 100 waterproof and super comfortable jacket this is super cool so
[3921.04 → 3925.76] we've got a close-up of the fabric that was used on a reference sample we got from our supplier you can
[3925.76 → 3932.80] see it looks like a normal woven fabric, but it's actually 3d printed, and then we've got a really early
[3932.80 → 3939.52] look at what our jacket based on this might end up looking like super cool so we'll use the newsletter as an
[3939.52 → 3943.04] opportunity to talk about what we're doing behind the scenes probably end up teaching you guys a
[3943.04 → 3949.52] thing or two like we've learned so much about mould flow simulation like plastic moulds as we've created
[3949.52 → 3955.92] the screwdriver um because it was not as simple as just finding an OEM screwdriver and silk-screening our
[3955.92 → 3963.68] label onto it that was not going to fly for us, and it's been oh has that ever been someone said please do
[3963.68 → 3967.52] not call it 3d printed down it would be 3d printed synthetic insulation
[3970.24 → 3977.04] because how yeah how does it work how's 3d printed down I'm going to have to get back to you on that one
[3977.04 → 3984.40] I'm just going based on what the creator warehouse team told me so I can get back to you on that one
[3984.40 → 3988.96] uh Nick's probably watching the show so maybe he'll figure that out and figure it out for the newsletter
[3988.96 → 3995.44] hey anyway the point is we've got uh probably one more topic for you guys today you want to talk
[3995.44 → 4000.56] about the five flow yeah sure let's jump to it give me one sec
[4005.04 → 4013.44] where's the topic okay so they're more they are a significant step forward towards the glasses type
[4013.44 → 4018.88] stuff it's an it's a VR headset aimed at the average person, and they're looking to make VR more
[4018.88 → 4025.60] mainstream it's lightweight 189 grams has a 100 degree for 3.2k resolution 75 hertz refresh rate
[4025.60 → 4031.12] speakers and noise and echo cancelling mics um there 's's a comment saying it could be decent
[4031.12 → 4037.04] for virtual meetings I don't think we're there yet um, but maybe it's a step in that direction uh two
[4037.04 → 4041.52] front-facing cameras to handle inside our motion tracking uh with plans for hand tracking in the
[4041.52 → 4051.60] future hey whatever um it costs 499 dollars it's a Qualcomm xr1 chipset 64 gigs of storage with no
[4051.60 → 4061.92] expansion slots um they look trendy 75 hertz though 75 hertz right they look trendy okay, and they're very
[4061.92 → 4068.56] light, but they're 75 hertz, but they're 75 hertz all right see you later and in Canada there's 650
[4068.56 → 4080.48] cool yeah time for super chats hey oh man oh you guys send too many super chats you guys are gonna
[4080.48 → 4085.12] have to dial it back and stop sending so many super chats because I really can't read them all um i
[4085.12 → 4091.76] like need to get home at the end of the show so hey 1218 says I paid MSRP for my PlayStation 5 got an
[4091.76 → 4096.16] email from Sony inviting me to buy one just had to sign in with my account got it in four days yeah not bad
[4096.16 → 4105.84] um postal nostalgia trip says when an official source starts to price increase it's anarchy
[4105.84 → 4109.76] the wild card at the end of the day increases the price for normal people not that the scalpers would
[4109.76 → 4113.84] care they make the same regardless when official I'm actually not quite sure what you're talking about
[4113.84 → 4120.40] anarchy okay crook savage says devil's advocate for Best Buy this will likely help prevent scalping
[4120.40 → 4125.76] as well I worked store pickups um PSS went the same to the same two to three people every shipment
[4125.76 → 4129.36] they have rules saying you can only buy two so you'll have to buy a subscription for each order
[4129.36 → 4135.36] oh that's interesting because you would need a new subscription yeah you could do that rule without
[4135.36 → 4141.52] charging 200 bucks a year you knew it was the same people picking it up every time that is the worst no i
[4141.52 → 4149.04] do not accept that at all I'm sorry dude that's not okay that is so ridiculous like the comment that
[4149.04 → 4153.76] just came up like oh I just had to sign in with my account it's like yeah just go to Sony's web like
[4153.76 → 4158.32] this is how it should work just go to Sony's website yeah make a PSN account like we were talking
[4158.32 → 4163.36] about how memberships are okay it's a membership whatever you don't even have to pay for it and then
[4163.36 → 4168.16] it just works that way they could even make it so you have to like log in with PSN or something to
[4168.16 → 4175.52] show that like at the store I don't care how it works but like this well at any rate um spaceman
[4175.52 → 4181.04] are there any cosmetic ways we can pimp out our pcs might be a fun thing to do in the chip shortage
[4181.04 → 4187.36] for a lot less um we kind of tried that with tech showdown you guys didn't really like it because
[4187.36 → 4192.88] we're not very good at if it was fun uh Ben s says retailer websites should sell hot items using a
[4192.88 → 4197.92] silent offer system i actually strongly disagree with that we have a silent offer system for real
[4197.92 → 4203.12] estate in Canada and has caused a lot of big problems yeah uh mike Slovak says I wonder if this is
[4203.12 → 4206.40] some kind of situation where the shipping companies and manufacturing plants are taking
[4206.40 → 4212.16] the highest profit margin which is in turn rating the MSRP shipping costs are going up but I can tell
[4212.16 → 4217.84] you right now that manufacturing plants are probably not the largest contributor because usually they are
[4217.84 → 4225.28] contractually bound to whatever cost they've agreed on with the um with the brand be it
[4225.28 → 4233.04] Sony or Microsoft or whatever the case may be um all right Armand says could you
[4233.04 → 4239.44] give some insight into why retailers don't offer back orders uh so uh yeah I can uh LTT store
[4239.44 → 4245.04] doesn't offer back orders because I don't want to deal with if it's well honestly it generates so
[4245.04 → 4249.84] many more complaints than it does happy customers yeah we just do the back and stock notifications
[4249.84 → 4255.20] yeah as soon as you take someone's money they're your customer, and now they're always right and
[4255.92 → 4264.00] when they say I should have it now they're right except I don't have it so I can't give it to you
[4264.00 → 4268.88] I can't give it to you yeah there's nothing I can do and so for me, you know nick and I have gone back
[4268.88 → 4277.36] and forth about this a lot he is far more in support of back orders than I am but I've pushed back hard
[4277.36 → 4283.76] every time because we've seen situations where he and i both almost pulled the trigger on allowing
[4283.76 → 4289.44] pre-ordering or back-ordering like say for example the shipment was in the port in Vancouver we're
[4289.44 → 4295.36] like okay let's just let's just turn it on and say it'll ship out in a week boom delays in the port it
[4295.36 → 4300.16] takes two to three weeks to hit us, or it's in customs or whatever, and we're like who dodged a bullet
[4300.72 → 4306.96] because you do not want, and we're at the scale now where we could launch a product, and we could have
[4306.96 → 4312.80] literally thousands of people pre-order or backorder it yeah you do not want thousands of
[4312.80 → 4318.08] support tickets how many people like still have their receipts or not anymore I guess but remember
[4318.08 → 4323.60] the duke nuke forever or whatever people had receipts that were like nine years old they were
[4323.60 → 4328.40] yellow, and you could barely tell what it was for anymore like all this junk it's just like no dude
[4328.40 → 4334.88] just take the money when you have the product um GAR woody says love the show I watch from the UK would
[4334.88 → 4341.20] you consider a video about PCI e lanes I believe we've done that before on the tech quickie channel
[4341.84 → 4349.68] uh PCI e lanes let's have a look here yep the sneaky thing about PCI Express CPU versus chipset so we
[4349.68 → 4359.76] kind of explain how uh how the lanes are connected within your computer thanks Anthony Ñuñoa Jordan says
[4359.76 → 4364.56] as borders open up I know that Ltd is going to be on your minds are ticket buyers from 2020 going to
[4364.56 → 4373.84] be invited to access the next Ltd early that's a really great question and I have no idea um how
[4373.84 → 4377.84] we're going to tackle that it seems like it's one of those that would be the right thing to do things
[4377.84 → 4382.00] but the logistics of it may end up being too complicated I don't think we're going to have
[4382.00 → 4389.28] limited ticket availability though for certain classes of ticket like a VIP we will but for
[4389.28 → 4393.84] general admission I think we're going to be in the convention centre next time we do it so we
[4393.84 → 4398.80] should be able to accept as many people as want to come up the you land it's probably also going to
[4398.80 → 4402.48] be limited but what we're going to have to see how it goes sorry we're going to play that by ear
[4402.48 → 4408.88] there's a comment in float plane yeah it says uh I feel like there was a technical inaccuracy with the
[4408.88 → 4413.84] monoprice uh display port cable it's an active cable that won't function correctly with the
[4413.84 → 4419.20] tester the tester only works with passive cables that monoprice cable to my knowledge is not an
[4419.20 → 4424.64] active cable I don't know just reading comment yeah you just that that display port cable yeah no
[4424.64 → 4430.40] it's just a thick old copper cable sorry capes I don't think so um it's a ancient one maybe
[4430.40 → 4436.16] monoprice's long display ports are active now I don't believe that older one was though okay uh what
[4436.16 → 4442.32] was I looking at here uh brad says I love how open LTT is about sponsors and finances to that end
[4442.32 → 4451.76] does secret labs pay for having their chairs on the Wang show and if not why I don't know if they do um
[4452.80 → 4460.08] i I could certainly ask uh if they do it's probably not that much
[4460.08 → 4468.96] i just when show is kind of like we do and show because we love one show it's not the most profitable
[4468.96 → 4473.52] thing we do to be clear we're not we're not losing money by any stretch of the imagination especially
[4473.52 → 4481.60] because of great sponsors like LG today as well as uh fresh books and tux care like that that makes
[4481.60 → 4487.84] when show make sense but just you know how much we would charge to like to have a chair back there i I suspect
[4487.84 → 4494.16] it's not very much then again maybe it's a lot i just legitimately don't know thanks Matt hedge cock
[4495.12 → 4507.12] uh and I think that's pretty much the end of it yep yeah all right uh but hey thanks shifter 999
[4509.68 → 4516.56] yeah Stewart this is a really important topic uh Disney has not been paying some authors
[4516.56 → 4522.00] uh for several properties like Star Wars formerly owned by Lucasfilm and fox check out the hashtag
[4522.00 → 4529.28] Disney must pay yeah uh if anyone was wondering if Disney is an unscrupulous company if you were
[4529.28 → 4535.36] somehow still wondering for like ever by the way um yeah if you were wondering that inception this is not
[4535.36 → 4545.04] do check out hashtag Disney must pay it's atrocious it's its actually horrible um yeah I mean between that
[4545.04 → 4551.76] and the meagre credit and payments that the writers responsible for the storylines in the marvel
[4551.76 → 4562.16] cinematic universe are getting between that and that um uh it's yeah it's its just not a question of
[4562.16 → 4568.72] whether Disney is unscrupulous or not linux update uh you guys are just going to have to wait
[4568.72 → 4574.00] for the video i have to get home and relieve my child care okay, okay bye guys bye
[4575.36 → 4577.68] Eckhart's ladder covers apparently the Disney stuff
[4580.48 → 4590.72] hi Nick apple
[4598.72 → 4608.32] oh hold on I got this up and oh geez oh geez rick
[4612.16 → 4623.36] how is this happening I don't understand
