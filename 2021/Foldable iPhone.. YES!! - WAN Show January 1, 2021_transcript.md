[0.00 --> 1.44]  Where to go live says YouTube.
[3.62 --> 4.98]  Oh shoot that's too far.
[5.90 --> 7.00]  Okay is this gonna...
[7.52 --> 8.92]  Oh I think we're live.
[9.34 --> 10.40]  I think we're live.
[11.22 --> 13.90]  Welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen.
[14.12 --> 15.96]  I hope you are ready for a fantastic
[15.96 --> 17.52]  New Year's show today.
[17.62 --> 19.60]  That's right it is the 1st of January
[19.60 --> 20.72]  because
[20.72 --> 23.98]  well Luke and I quite honestly
[23.98 --> 25.20]  are pretty boring people.
[25.30 --> 27.12]  I'm making some assumptions about Luke but
[27.12 --> 28.54]  I did not...
[28.54 --> 29.04]  You're on it.
[29.04 --> 31.90]  I heard a bunch of noise outside
[31.90 --> 32.54]  and I was like
[32.54 --> 35.16]  hey hun what is that?
[35.96 --> 36.72]  And Yvonne's like
[36.72 --> 37.76]  fireworks.
[38.08 --> 38.76]  It's midnight.
[39.24 --> 39.74]  And I was like
[39.74 --> 40.68]  oh yeah.
[43.82 --> 45.06]  Oh yeah that thing.
[45.86 --> 46.64]  What'd you get up to?
[47.10 --> 49.20]  I had the sliding door open
[49.20 --> 51.00]  because it was a little warm
[51.00 --> 52.94]  so I was letting the house
[52.94 --> 53.92]  cool down a little bit
[53.92 --> 56.12]  and then the fireworks went off
[56.12 --> 58.22]  so as the old person that I am
[58.22 --> 59.76]  I closed the door
[59.76 --> 61.12]  as to not bother the bird.
[61.38 --> 63.58]  That was my New Year's experience.
[63.96 --> 64.44]  Nice.
[64.66 --> 65.10]  Nice.
[65.10 --> 66.28]  I like it.
[66.44 --> 66.82]  You know what?
[66.86 --> 67.98]  I was supposed to eat
[67.98 --> 68.76]  the fancy
[68.76 --> 70.34]  the fancy ice cream
[70.34 --> 71.20]  that Dennis got
[71.20 --> 72.28]  for me and Yvonne
[72.28 --> 72.88]  for Christmas.
[72.88 --> 74.66]  We were going to watch a movie
[74.66 --> 77.04]  and well unfortunately
[77.04 --> 77.94]  the plan was to watch
[77.94 --> 78.82]  Wonder Woman 1984
[78.82 --> 81.16]  and according to the carpool critics
[81.16 --> 81.54]  anyway
[81.54 --> 82.82]  it's like
[82.82 --> 84.32]  eh.
[85.30 --> 86.46]  So yeah.
[86.62 --> 87.28]  Oh that sucks.
[87.42 --> 87.62]  Yeah.
[87.88 --> 89.72]  So I'm not sure
[89.72 --> 90.50]  that I'm going to bother.
[90.94 --> 91.64]  She's made it about
[91.64 --> 92.42]  a third of the way through.
[92.48 --> 93.18]  What do you think of Wonder Woman
[93.18 --> 93.66]  so far?
[94.66 --> 95.30]  It's okay.
[95.30 --> 96.06]  She says
[96.06 --> 96.78]  it's okay.
[97.44 --> 98.32]  So yeah.
[98.40 --> 98.70]  Alright.
[98.88 --> 99.60]  Sounds about right.
[99.98 --> 101.24]  We've got a bunch of great topics
[101.24 --> 102.18]  for you guys today.
[102.62 --> 105.10]  Two foldable iPhone prototypes
[105.10 --> 107.22]  have reportedly passed
[107.22 --> 109.50]  internal durability tests
[109.50 --> 110.36]  at Apple.
[110.58 --> 112.26]  How freaking sick
[112.26 --> 113.46]  would that be?
[113.84 --> 114.70]  In other news
[114.70 --> 116.92]  Shroud
[116.92 --> 119.16]  apparently watches
[119.16 --> 121.98]  LTT videos on stream
[121.98 --> 123.84]  on a fairly regular basis.
[124.24 --> 124.44]  Okay.
[124.64 --> 125.44]  I didn't know this.
[125.80 --> 126.80]  So I had the experience
[126.80 --> 127.40]  We've talked about this
[127.40 --> 128.20]  on WAN before.
[128.42 --> 128.66]  Well,
[128.84 --> 129.70]  whatever.
[131.34 --> 134.08]  So I had the experience
[134.08 --> 134.76]  today
[134.76 --> 136.96]  of watching someone
[136.96 --> 138.10]  watch me
[138.10 --> 139.12]  which
[139.12 --> 140.62]  is real surreal
[140.62 --> 141.72]  and what I've decided
[141.72 --> 143.06]  is that later on
[143.06 --> 144.12]  during the WAN show
[144.12 --> 145.00]  since
[145.00 --> 147.20]  Shroud didn't ask
[147.20 --> 147.78]  my permission
[147.78 --> 148.72]  to show my videos
[148.72 --> 149.34]  on stream
[149.34 --> 150.52]  without asking
[150.52 --> 151.24]  his permission
[151.24 --> 152.70]  I'm going to show
[152.70 --> 153.58]  his video
[153.58 --> 154.62]  of him watching
[154.62 --> 155.40]  my video
[155.40 --> 156.62]  on my stream
[156.62 --> 157.94]  and we're going to see
[157.94 --> 159.60]  how far we can take this.
[159.90 --> 160.06]  Okay.
[160.18 --> 160.76]  So there you go.
[160.90 --> 161.76]  That's my two topics
[161.76 --> 162.24]  for today.
[162.92 --> 163.28]  Inception.
[163.46 --> 163.96]  I like it.
[164.56 --> 165.58]  What else we got?
[166.78 --> 168.48]  The artificial sun
[168.48 --> 169.62]  rises in the east.
[169.70 --> 170.18]  I'm going to give you
[170.18 --> 171.26]  no further details.
[171.44 --> 171.84]  That's just
[171.84 --> 173.00]  we're leaving it at that.
[173.72 --> 174.16]  Also,
[174.16 --> 175.54]  a major hedge fund
[175.54 --> 176.90]  advises Intel
[176.90 --> 178.32]  to outsource
[178.32 --> 179.84]  CPU manufacturing
[179.84 --> 180.36]  which
[180.36 --> 183.50]  is quite spicy.
[183.74 --> 183.92]  Yeah.
[183.96 --> 184.40]  Why don't we
[184.40 --> 185.04]  why don't we
[185.04 --> 186.14]  why don't we talk about
[186.14 --> 187.68]  why don't we talk about that
[187.68 --> 189.80]  but only after the intro.
[190.44 --> 190.74]  Yes.
[204.16 --> 212.58]  The show is brought to you
[212.58 --> 213.30]  today by
[213.30 --> 214.62]  oh balls
[214.62 --> 215.20]  I forget
[215.20 --> 218.18]  someone for sure though
[218.18 --> 219.28]  Seasonic
[219.28 --> 220.24]  Redux
[220.24 --> 220.78]  and
[220.78 --> 222.22]  Colonel Care Plus
[222.22 --> 223.24]  that's right.
[224.12 --> 225.26]  Oh shoot.
[225.34 --> 226.18]  That means I set up
[226.18 --> 227.14]  totally the wrong
[227.14 --> 228.06]  lower thirds
[228.06 --> 228.50]  for later.
[228.74 --> 229.52]  That's okay.
[229.52 --> 231.02]  we will sort that out
[231.02 --> 231.40]  later.
[231.98 --> 232.24]  Okay.
[232.70 --> 233.16]  Oh no.
[233.32 --> 233.96]  I said there was
[233.96 --> 234.80]  I said there was
[234.80 --> 235.36]  something that I was
[235.36 --> 235.74]  going to like
[235.74 --> 236.52]  save for the show
[236.52 --> 236.96]  didn't I?
[238.64 --> 239.56]  Did I give you
[239.56 --> 240.56]  any context
[240.56 --> 241.04]  for it
[241.04 --> 241.46]  whatsoever?
[241.46 --> 245.28]  Oh no.
[245.64 --> 246.54]  I don't think so.
[247.08 --> 248.54]  What were we talking about?
[249.50 --> 250.00]  It wasn't
[250.00 --> 250.94]  We were talking about
[250.94 --> 251.80]  development stuff.
[252.14 --> 252.96]  Development stuff.
[253.28 --> 253.94]  I was talking about
[253.94 --> 254.70]  flow plane stuff.
[255.16 --> 255.68]  Crap.
[256.08 --> 256.86]  All right.
[257.00 --> 258.36]  Well it was pretty cool
[258.36 --> 259.78]  to be in Mr. Beast Rewind
[259.78 --> 260.12]  today.
[260.28 --> 261.12]  So that's one thing
[261.12 --> 261.78]  that kind of
[261.78 --> 263.34]  flashed through my brain
[263.34 --> 264.10]  while we were talking
[264.10 --> 264.72]  about that
[264.72 --> 265.06]  but
[265.06 --> 266.98]  that was not
[266.98 --> 267.80]  the thing that I
[267.80 --> 268.74]  wanted to talk about.
[268.86 --> 269.38]  That's okay.
[269.48 --> 270.00]  Why don't we jump
[270.00 --> 270.80]  right into
[270.80 --> 272.58]  two iPhone prototypes
[272.58 --> 273.66]  allegedly
[273.66 --> 274.56]  allegedly
[274.56 --> 276.58]  passing internal
[276.58 --> 277.70]  durability tests
[277.70 --> 278.92]  at Apple.
[279.04 --> 279.66]  This is
[279.66 --> 280.34]  pretty
[280.34 --> 281.58]  freaking exciting.
[281.72 --> 282.08]  So this is
[282.08 --> 282.66]  according to
[282.66 --> 283.66]  Taiwanese website
[283.66 --> 285.36]  Economic Daily News
[285.36 --> 286.20]  and
[286.20 --> 287.48]  according to them
[287.48 --> 288.40]  tests of an
[288.40 --> 289.24]  Apple designed
[289.24 --> 290.46]  folding hinge system
[290.46 --> 291.30]  for two
[291.30 --> 292.48]  different iPhones
[292.48 --> 293.58]  were reportedly
[293.58 --> 294.82]  recently completed
[294.82 --> 295.76]  at the Foxconn
[295.76 --> 296.46]  factory in
[296.46 --> 297.38]  Shenzhen, China.
[298.24 --> 298.70]  What do you think
[298.70 --> 299.28]  that would mean
[299.28 --> 299.86]  if it's two
[299.86 --> 300.68]  different iPhones
[300.68 --> 301.08]  do you think
[301.08 --> 301.54]  that would mean
[301.54 --> 302.26]  the high end
[302.26 --> 302.76]  low end
[302.76 --> 303.52]  of their entire
[303.52 --> 304.14]  next launch?
[304.42 --> 304.90]  No, I think
[304.90 --> 305.32]  that would be
[305.32 --> 305.94]  two different
[305.94 --> 307.22]  sizes of
[307.22 --> 308.20]  probably a
[308.20 --> 309.22]  completely new
[309.22 --> 310.08]  utterly unique
[310.08 --> 310.46]  SKU.
[311.44 --> 312.00]  Interesting.
[312.24 --> 312.38]  Okay.
[312.84 --> 313.90]  And that would
[313.90 --> 314.42]  be something
[314.42 --> 315.42]  that even
[315.42 --> 316.32]  I don't know
[316.32 --> 317.32]  even two years
[317.32 --> 318.36]  ago I probably
[318.36 --> 319.28]  wouldn't have
[319.28 --> 319.80]  predicted
[319.80 --> 320.62]  but if you
[320.62 --> 321.48]  look at Apple's
[321.48 --> 322.60]  trend over the
[322.60 --> 323.52]  last three to
[323.52 --> 323.96]  five years
[323.96 --> 324.38]  I mean do you
[324.38 --> 324.92]  remember when
[324.92 --> 325.88]  the iPhone was
[325.88 --> 326.94]  the iPhone
[326.94 --> 328.62]  and Apple's
[328.62 --> 329.26]  silly branding
[329.26 --> 329.62]  where they
[329.62 --> 330.24]  don't call it
[330.24 --> 331.12]  an iPhone
[331.12 --> 332.32]  or the iPhone
[332.32 --> 333.22]  they just call
[333.22 --> 333.82]  it iPhone
[333.82 --> 334.42]  do you remember
[334.42 --> 335.20]  when that actually
[335.20 --> 335.76]  made sense
[335.76 --> 336.38]  because there was
[336.38 --> 337.18]  only one
[337.18 --> 337.88]  iPhone?
[338.76 --> 340.10]  Well that's been
[340.10 --> 340.74]  dead forever
[340.74 --> 341.76]  like their current
[341.76 --> 342.12]  lineup
[342.12 --> 343.08]  let's pull this
[343.08 --> 343.26]  up
[343.26 --> 344.52]  let's pull this
[344.52 --> 345.12]  up ladies and
[345.12 --> 345.30]  gentlemen
[345.30 --> 346.68]  apple.com
[346.68 --> 347.30]  okay
[347.30 --> 348.10]  wait
[348.10 --> 349.00]  yes
[349.00 --> 350.06]  it was something
[350.06 --> 350.50]  I was gonna
[350.50 --> 351.22]  screen share
[351.22 --> 353.52]  okay
[353.52 --> 355.20]  where is it
[355.20 --> 357.86]  maybe it was
[357.86 --> 358.50]  the shroud thing
[358.50 --> 359.28]  okay it doesn't
[359.28 --> 359.48]  matter
[359.48 --> 360.14]  the point is
[360.14 --> 360.60]  let's pull up
[360.60 --> 361.34]  apple.com
[361.34 --> 362.04]  so under
[362.04 --> 363.02]  iPhone
[363.02 --> 364.10]  you've got
[364.10 --> 365.44]  iPhone 12 Pro
[365.44 --> 366.60]  two different
[366.60 --> 367.04]  sizes
[367.04 --> 368.36]  iPhone 12
[368.36 --> 369.58]  two different
[369.58 --> 369.94]  sizes
[369.94 --> 371.48]  iPhone SE
[371.48 --> 372.68]  iPhone 11
[372.68 --> 374.08]  iPhone 10R
[374.08 --> 374.92]  and then you've
[374.92 --> 375.38]  got this
[375.38 --> 376.20]  this compare
[376.20 --> 376.70]  feature
[376.70 --> 377.60]  so you've
[377.60 --> 377.96]  got a
[377.96 --> 378.42]  you've got a
[378.42 --> 379.16]  compare feature
[379.16 --> 379.82]  because there's
[379.82 --> 380.70]  so many iPhones
[380.70 --> 381.48]  you need a
[381.48 --> 382.28]  feature specifically
[382.28 --> 383.04]  to figure out
[383.04 --> 383.56]  you know which
[383.56 --> 384.68]  how much iPhone
[384.68 --> 385.82]  is enough for
[385.82 --> 386.04]  you
[386.04 --> 387.02]  and to be
[387.02 --> 387.54]  clear I'm not
[387.54 --> 388.18]  saying that
[388.18 --> 389.16]  it's a you
[389.16 --> 389.82]  know a terrible
[389.82 --> 390.88]  idea or anything
[390.88 --> 392.34]  to have you
[392.34 --> 393.14]  know lots of
[393.14 --> 394.88]  lots of iPhones
[394.88 --> 395.70]  available for your
[395.70 --> 396.06]  customers
[396.06 --> 397.22]  I'm just saying
[397.22 --> 398.12]  that that wasn't
[398.12 --> 399.04]  Apple's traditional
[399.04 --> 400.30]  approach with the
[400.30 --> 400.60]  iPhone
[400.60 --> 401.78]  the idea was that
[401.78 --> 402.70]  when you bought
[402.70 --> 403.50]  an iPhone you
[403.50 --> 404.46]  were getting this
[404.46 --> 405.70]  this curated
[405.70 --> 407.52]  this validated
[407.52 --> 409.00]  experience
[409.00 --> 409.28]  millions
[409.28 --> 412.52]  wait it was
[412.52 --> 413.54]  something to do
[413.54 --> 414.32]  with the
[414.32 --> 414.96]  Model Y
[414.96 --> 415.48]  video I
[415.48 --> 415.72]  think
[415.72 --> 416.58]  it doesn't
[416.58 --> 416.88]  matter
[416.88 --> 417.50]  fine I'm
[417.50 --> 417.80]  over it
[417.80 --> 418.38]  I'm over it
[418.38 --> 420.08]  so what's
[420.08 --> 420.88]  happening then
[420.88 --> 421.56]  is that
[421.56 --> 422.52]  from like
[422.52 --> 423.42]  from whether
[423.42 --> 423.98]  it's from
[423.98 --> 424.68]  a developer
[424.68 --> 425.30]  perspective
[425.30 --> 426.26]  or a user
[426.26 --> 426.76]  perspective
[426.76 --> 427.96]  the iPhone
[427.96 --> 428.92]  is changing
[428.92 --> 430.14]  currently
[430.14 --> 431.06]  you can get
[431.06 --> 432.06]  iPhones with
[432.06 --> 433.44]  all kinds
[433.44 --> 433.88]  of different
[433.88 --> 434.28]  sizes
[434.28 --> 434.92]  all kinds
[434.92 --> 435.32]  of different
[435.32 --> 435.88]  capabilities
[435.88 --> 436.64]  I mean it
[436.64 --> 437.06]  wasn't that
[437.06 --> 437.52]  long ago
[437.52 --> 437.82]  that you
[437.82 --> 438.48]  could still
[438.48 --> 438.70]  get
[438.70 --> 439.32]  actually no
[439.32 --> 440.36]  you can
[440.36 --> 441.16]  still get
[441.16 --> 441.66]  an iPhone
[441.66 --> 442.56]  with a
[442.56 --> 443.04]  touch
[443.04 --> 444.06]  touch ID
[444.06 --> 444.70]  home button
[444.70 --> 445.54]  like
[445.54 --> 447.04]  that is
[447.04 --> 447.58]  that is a
[447.58 --> 448.28]  fundamentally
[448.28 --> 449.78]  very different
[449.78 --> 450.64]  experience
[450.64 --> 451.38]  compared to
[451.38 --> 452.08]  the current
[452.08 --> 452.52]  paradigm
[452.52 --> 453.04]  which is
[453.04 --> 453.52]  motion
[453.52 --> 454.28]  and
[454.28 --> 455.10]  excuse me
[455.10 --> 455.40]  motion
[455.40 --> 456.40]  gesture control
[456.40 --> 457.20]  and using
[457.20 --> 457.86]  face ID
[457.86 --> 458.72]  so
[458.72 --> 460.58]  two three
[460.58 --> 461.10]  years ago
[461.10 --> 461.70]  I would have
[461.70 --> 461.96]  said
[461.96 --> 462.42]  no
[462.42 --> 463.34]  there's no
[463.34 --> 463.72]  way
[463.72 --> 464.48]  that Apple
[464.48 --> 465.16]  that if
[465.16 --> 466.52]  there's no
[466.52 --> 466.88]  way they're
[466.88 --> 467.12]  going to
[467.12 --> 467.58]  bring out
[467.58 --> 467.98]  like a
[467.98 --> 468.36]  completely
[468.36 --> 468.90]  separate
[468.90 --> 469.28]  model
[469.28 --> 469.84]  of folding
[469.84 --> 470.24]  iPhone
[470.24 --> 471.62]  now I'm
[471.62 --> 471.98]  looking at
[471.98 --> 472.34]  it going
[472.34 --> 472.96]  there's no
[472.96 --> 473.48]  way that
[473.48 --> 474.22]  they don't
[474.22 --> 474.98]  because
[474.98 --> 475.54]  Apple
[475.54 --> 476.42]  if anything
[476.42 --> 477.08]  has shown
[477.08 --> 477.50]  themselves
[477.50 --> 477.98]  to be
[477.98 --> 478.60]  extremely
[478.60 --> 479.32]  conservative
[479.32 --> 480.16]  about
[480.16 --> 481.08]  forcing their
[481.08 --> 481.98]  users to
[481.98 --> 482.48]  change
[482.48 --> 483.38]  unless they've
[483.38 --> 484.10]  offered a
[484.10 --> 484.42]  compelling
[484.42 --> 484.82]  upgrade
[484.82 --> 485.20]  option
[485.20 --> 485.96]  so
[485.96 --> 487.10]  for example
[487.10 --> 488.22]  the iPhone SE
[488.22 --> 489.52]  still kicking
[489.52 --> 489.92]  around
[489.92 --> 490.56]  for people
[490.56 --> 491.12]  who want
[491.12 --> 491.84]  touch ID
[491.84 --> 492.82]  and who
[492.82 --> 493.34]  want a
[493.34 --> 493.68]  physical
[493.68 --> 494.10]  button
[494.10 --> 495.34]  iPhone 12
[495.34 --> 495.60]  mini
[495.60 --> 496.36]  is something
[496.36 --> 496.76]  that they
[496.76 --> 497.76]  finally brought
[497.76 --> 498.20]  out to
[498.20 --> 498.70]  address
[498.70 --> 499.34]  the need
[499.34 --> 500.40]  from users
[500.40 --> 501.08]  for a
[501.08 --> 501.64]  smaller
[501.64 --> 502.54]  one-handable
[502.54 --> 502.90]  iPhone
[502.90 --> 504.12]  and they're
[504.12 --> 504.96]  very tactical
[504.96 --> 505.64]  about the
[505.64 --> 505.94]  way that
[505.94 --> 506.28]  they do
[506.28 --> 506.86]  these things
[506.86 --> 507.80]  they will
[507.80 --> 508.56]  wait
[508.56 --> 509.44]  three to
[509.44 --> 510.02]  four years
[510.02 --> 510.64]  which they
[510.64 --> 511.00]  know
[511.00 --> 511.72]  is a
[511.72 --> 512.18]  reasonable
[512.18 --> 512.86]  upgrade
[512.86 --> 513.22]  cycle
[513.22 --> 513.72]  for like
[513.72 --> 514.20]  a non
[514.20 --> 515.10]  enthusiast
[515.10 --> 516.06]  and then
[516.06 --> 516.44]  they'll
[516.44 --> 516.74]  go
[516.74 --> 517.24]  okay
[517.24 --> 518.32]  have we
[518.32 --> 518.74]  managed to
[518.74 --> 519.06]  get these
[519.06 --> 519.40]  guys to
[519.40 --> 519.76]  upgrade
[519.76 --> 520.76]  no
[520.76 --> 522.18]  all right
[522.18 --> 522.98]  okay
[522.98 --> 523.50]  all right
[523.50 --> 523.92]  let's do
[523.92 --> 524.10]  it
[524.10 --> 524.68]  let's do
[524.68 --> 524.84]  it
[524.84 --> 525.20]  let's
[525.20 --> 525.58]  let's
[525.58 --> 526.12]  continue
[526.12 --> 526.72]  let's
[526.72 --> 527.04]  continue
[527.04 --> 527.54]  to support
[527.54 --> 528.02]  this segment
[528.02 --> 528.36]  of our
[528.36 --> 529.00]  customer base
[529.00 --> 530.20]  so there's
[530.20 --> 530.86]  no way
[530.86 --> 531.26]  that they're
[531.26 --> 531.58]  just gonna
[531.58 --> 532.26]  bring in
[532.26 --> 532.76]  a folding
[532.76 --> 533.10]  iPhone
[533.10 --> 534.54]  and replace
[534.54 --> 535.40]  the iPhone
[535.40 --> 535.66]  Pro
[535.66 --> 536.80]  I don't
[536.80 --> 537.24]  I don't
[537.24 --> 537.76]  buy it
[537.76 --> 538.58]  but then
[538.58 --> 538.84]  again
[538.84 --> 539.28]  I would
[539.28 --> 539.60]  have also
[539.60 --> 539.86]  said
[539.86 --> 540.10]  there's
[540.10 --> 540.44]  no way
[540.44 --> 540.62]  they're
[540.62 --> 540.94]  just gonna
[540.94 --> 541.60]  completely
[541.60 --> 542.02]  remove
[542.02 --> 542.54]  touch ID
[542.54 --> 542.88]  and say
[542.88 --> 543.06]  okay
[543.06 --> 543.44]  it has
[543.44 --> 543.66]  to be
[543.66 --> 544.18]  face ID
[544.18 --> 544.40]  if you
[544.40 --> 544.58]  want a
[544.58 --> 544.84]  high-end
[544.84 --> 545.06]  you want
[545.06 --> 545.24]  a new
[545.24 --> 545.52]  iPhone
[545.52 --> 545.78]  you want
[545.78 --> 546.02]  high-end
[546.02 --> 546.28]  iPhone
[546.28 --> 546.56]  that's
[546.56 --> 546.72]  it
[546.72 --> 547.14]  you're
[547.14 --> 547.36]  done
[547.36 --> 547.62]  you're
[547.62 --> 547.82]  out
[547.82 --> 548.66]  so
[548.66 --> 549.54]  I kind
[549.54 --> 549.78]  of talked
[549.78 --> 550.10]  myself
[550.10 --> 550.40]  out of
[550.40 --> 550.58]  it
[550.58 --> 551.92]  maybe
[551.92 --> 553.00]  maybe
[553.00 --> 553.68]  the iPhone
[553.68 --> 554.52]  folding
[554.52 --> 555.44]  iPhone
[555.44 --> 555.84]  fold
[555.84 --> 556.24]  or whatever
[556.24 --> 556.60]  they end
[556.60 --> 556.92]  up calling
[556.92 --> 557.00]  it
[557.00 --> 557.34]  they definitely
[557.34 --> 557.72]  won't call
[557.72 --> 558.04]  it that
[558.04 --> 558.26]  because
[558.26 --> 558.64]  Galaxy
[558.64 --> 558.98]  Fold
[558.98 --> 559.20]  they got
[559.20 --> 559.38]  to come
[559.38 --> 559.48]  up
[559.48 --> 559.68]  with a
[559.68 --> 559.80]  new
[559.80 --> 560.06]  name
[560.06 --> 560.96]  so
[560.96 --> 561.24]  maybe
[561.24 --> 561.62]  yeah
[561.62 --> 562.16]  maybe
[562.16 --> 562.36]  the
[562.36 --> 562.94]  iFold
[562.94 --> 564.18]  will
[564.18 --> 564.82]  replace
[564.82 --> 565.04]  the
[565.04 --> 565.34]  high-end
[565.34 --> 565.66]  but I
[565.66 --> 568.30]  I don't
[568.30 --> 568.54]  know
[568.54 --> 568.96]  man
[568.96 --> 570.86]  yeah
[570.86 --> 571.18]  I'm
[571.18 --> 571.34]  kind
[571.34 --> 571.46]  of
[571.46 --> 571.62]  on
[571.62 --> 571.80]  each
[571.80 --> 572.06]  side
[572.06 --> 572.38]  because
[572.38 --> 572.70]  they
[572.70 --> 573.12]  don't
[573.12 --> 573.42]  normally
[573.42 --> 573.78]  introduce
[573.78 --> 573.92]  a
[573.92 --> 574.12]  feature
[574.12 --> 574.36]  this
[574.36 --> 574.60]  big
[574.60 --> 574.78]  without
[574.78 --> 575.14]  making
[575.14 --> 575.30]  a
[575.30 --> 575.58]  sweeping
[575.58 --> 576.06]  change
[576.06 --> 576.66]  but
[576.66 --> 577.06]  they
[577.06 --> 577.22]  have
[577.22 --> 577.44]  also
[577.44 --> 577.64]  been
[577.64 --> 577.92]  trending
[577.92 --> 578.18]  in the
[578.18 --> 578.42]  direction
[578.42 --> 578.60]  of
[578.60 --> 578.82]  more
[578.82 --> 579.28]  phones
[579.28 --> 580.10]  and
[580.10 --> 581.06]  more
[581.06 --> 581.40]  large
[581.40 --> 581.66]  feature
[581.66 --> 582.04]  differences
[582.04 --> 582.32]  between
[582.32 --> 582.46]  the
[582.46 --> 582.62]  phones
[582.62 --> 582.78]  so
[582.78 --> 583.08]  I
[583.08 --> 583.24]  could
[583.24 --> 583.40]  see
[583.40 --> 583.54]  them
[583.54 --> 583.74]  going
[583.74 --> 583.86]  in
[583.86 --> 583.98]  either
[583.98 --> 584.36]  direction
[584.36 --> 584.68]  this
[584.68 --> 584.84]  is
[584.84 --> 584.98]  a
[584.98 --> 585.32]  great
[585.32 --> 585.72]  comment
[585.72 --> 585.96]  from
[585.96 --> 586.38]  endangered
[586.38 --> 586.80]  tiger
[586.80 --> 587.06]  over
[587.06 --> 587.20]  in
[587.20 --> 587.30]  the
[587.30 --> 587.62]  YouTube
[587.62 --> 588.02]  chat
[588.02 --> 588.80]  it's
[588.80 --> 589.16]  totally
[589.16 --> 589.44]  off
[589.44 --> 589.80]  topic
[589.80 --> 589.96]  I
[589.96 --> 590.08]  don't
[590.08 --> 590.20]  know
[590.20 --> 590.42]  who
[590.42 --> 590.58]  the
[590.58 --> 590.72]  hell
[590.72 --> 590.88]  they're
[590.88 --> 591.22]  talking
[591.22 --> 591.48]  to
[591.48 --> 591.62]  or
[591.62 --> 591.76]  what
[591.76 --> 591.96]  it's
[591.96 --> 592.20]  about
[592.20 --> 592.82]  the
[592.82 --> 593.16]  comment
[593.16 --> 593.52]  is
[593.52 --> 593.90]  a
[593.90 --> 594.36]  3DS
[594.36 --> 594.60]  would
[594.60 --> 594.74]  be
[594.74 --> 594.92]  more
[594.92 --> 595.38]  reliable
[595.38 --> 595.82]  which
[595.82 --> 596.00]  has
[596.00 --> 596.40]  nothing
[596.40 --> 596.68]  to do
[596.68 --> 596.78]  with
[596.78 --> 596.88]  what
[596.88 --> 596.98]  we're
[596.98 --> 597.22]  talking
[597.22 --> 597.48]  about
[597.48 --> 599.48]  but
[599.48 --> 599.70]  what
[599.70 --> 599.84]  I
[599.84 --> 600.12]  liked
[600.12 --> 600.30]  about
[600.30 --> 600.48]  the
[600.48 --> 600.82]  comment
[600.82 --> 601.02]  is
[601.02 --> 601.16]  it
[601.16 --> 601.40]  made
[601.40 --> 601.58]  me
[601.58 --> 602.06]  think
[602.06 --> 602.52]  of
[602.52 --> 602.64]  the
[602.64 --> 603.00]  Nintendo
[603.00 --> 603.26]  DS
[603.26 --> 604.46]  so
[604.46 --> 605.32]  Nintendo
[605.32 --> 605.86]  is
[605.86 --> 606.06]  one
[606.06 --> 606.16]  of
[606.16 --> 606.34]  those
[606.34 --> 606.76]  companies
[606.76 --> 607.42]  like
[607.42 --> 607.90]  Apple
[607.90 --> 608.34]  where
[608.34 --> 608.52]  they
[608.52 --> 608.70]  will
[608.70 --> 608.94]  go
[608.94 --> 609.28]  out
[609.28 --> 609.84]  and
[609.84 --> 609.98]  they
[609.98 --> 610.12]  will
[610.12 --> 610.36]  have
[610.36 --> 610.60]  a
[610.60 --> 611.00]  great
[611.00 --> 611.60]  product
[611.60 --> 612.86]  and
[612.86 --> 613.18]  or
[613.18 --> 613.46]  I
[613.46 --> 613.56]  don't
[613.56 --> 613.66]  know
[613.66 --> 613.82]  maybe
[613.82 --> 614.08]  like
[614.08 --> 614.38]  Apple
[614.38 --> 614.82]  was
[614.82 --> 615.76]  they're
[615.76 --> 616.12]  the
[616.12 --> 616.32]  kind
[616.32 --> 616.42]  of
[616.42 --> 616.72]  company
[616.72 --> 616.96]  that
[616.96 --> 617.10]  will
[617.10 --> 617.62]  have
[617.62 --> 617.76]  a
[617.76 --> 618.08]  great
[618.08 --> 618.42]  product
[618.42 --> 618.58]  in
[618.58 --> 618.70]  the
[618.70 --> 618.94]  market
[618.94 --> 619.32]  it's
[619.32 --> 619.60]  selling
[619.60 --> 620.18]  awesome
[620.18 --> 620.70]  developers
[620.70 --> 621.14]  love it
[621.14 --> 621.46]  gamers
[621.46 --> 622.00]  love it
[622.00 --> 622.80]  and
[622.80 --> 623.14]  they
[623.14 --> 623.40]  will
[623.40 --> 624.16]  completely
[624.16 --> 624.84]  get rid
[624.84 --> 625.20]  of it
[625.20 --> 625.56]  and
[625.56 --> 625.90]  take
[625.90 --> 626.42]  everything
[626.42 --> 626.64]  that
[626.64 --> 626.84]  people
[626.84 --> 627.12]  loved
[627.12 --> 627.40]  about
[627.40 --> 627.64]  it
[627.64 --> 628.06]  and
[628.06 --> 628.64]  reinvent
[628.64 --> 629.04]  it
[629.04 --> 629.80]  sometimes
[629.80 --> 630.36]  with
[630.36 --> 630.70]  great
[630.70 --> 631.20]  success
[631.20 --> 631.46]  like
[631.46 --> 631.60]  with
[631.60 --> 631.74]  the
[631.74 --> 631.94]  Wii
[631.94 --> 632.50]  and
[632.50 --> 632.68]  other
[632.68 --> 633.12]  times
[633.12 --> 633.56]  with
[633.56 --> 634.62]  not
[634.62 --> 634.76]  as
[634.76 --> 634.96]  much
[634.96 --> 635.42]  success
[635.42 --> 635.72]  like
[635.72 --> 635.98]  the
[635.98 --> 636.36]  Virtual
[636.36 --> 636.68]  Boy
[636.68 --> 637.12]  I
[637.12 --> 637.26]  think
[637.26 --> 637.38]  is
[637.38 --> 637.68]  probably
[637.68 --> 638.08]  the
[638.08 --> 638.34]  biggest
[638.34 --> 638.80]  failure
[638.80 --> 639.04]  that
[639.04 --> 639.16]  I
[639.16 --> 639.30]  can
[639.30 --> 639.52]  think
[639.52 --> 639.62]  of
[639.62 --> 639.76]  in
[639.76 --> 640.24]  Nintendo's
[640.24 --> 640.46]  history
[640.46 --> 640.64]  where
[640.64 --> 640.78]  they
[640.78 --> 641.06]  took
[641.06 --> 641.68]  something
[641.68 --> 641.86]  that
[641.86 --> 642.00]  was
[642.00 --> 642.36]  working
[642.36 --> 642.76]  well
[642.76 --> 643.30]  and
[643.30 --> 643.60]  just
[643.60 --> 644.44]  completely
[644.44 --> 644.86]  broke
[644.86 --> 645.38]  it
[645.38 --> 645.84]  but
[645.84 --> 646.02]  in
[646.02 --> 646.20]  like
[646.20 --> 646.32]  a
[646.32 --> 646.56]  bad
[646.56 --> 646.80]  way
[646.80 --> 647.68]  and
[647.68 --> 648.50]  you
[648.50 --> 648.62]  know
[648.62 --> 648.88]  that
[648.88 --> 649.10]  made
[649.10 --> 649.26]  me
[649.26 --> 649.60]  think
[649.60 --> 649.76]  I
[649.76 --> 649.90]  mean
[649.90 --> 650.04]  if
[650.04 --> 650.54]  Nintendo
[650.54 --> 651.00]  has
[651.00 --> 651.48]  the
[651.48 --> 652.68]  chutzpah
[652.68 --> 653.90]  to go
[653.90 --> 654.44]  hey
[654.44 --> 654.80]  that
[654.80 --> 655.14]  single
[655.14 --> 655.44]  screen
[655.44 --> 655.74]  gaming
[655.74 --> 656.34]  experience
[656.34 --> 656.90]  we're
[656.90 --> 657.10]  gonna
[657.10 --> 658.26]  flip it
[658.26 --> 659.06]  on its
[659.06 --> 659.30]  ear
[659.30 --> 660.10]  we're
[660.10 --> 660.26]  gonna
[660.26 --> 660.38]  put
[660.38 --> 661.02]  two
[661.02 --> 661.54]  screens
[661.54 --> 663.86]  maybe
[663.86 --> 664.22]  Apple
[664.22 --> 665.02]  has
[665.02 --> 665.18]  the
[665.18 --> 665.46]  stones
[665.46 --> 665.72]  too
[665.72 --> 665.92]  maybe
[665.92 --> 666.10]  they
[666.10 --> 666.44]  do
[666.44 --> 668.48]  I
[668.48 --> 669.00]  mean
[669.00 --> 669.16]  they
[669.16 --> 669.34]  have
[669.34 --> 669.50]  the
[669.50 --> 669.74]  money
[669.76 --> 671.88]  like
[671.88 --> 672.22]  that's
[672.22 --> 672.42]  one
[672.42 --> 672.64]  thing
[672.64 --> 672.82]  with
[672.82 --> 673.22]  Nintendo
[673.22 --> 673.50]  is
[673.50 --> 673.64]  like
[673.64 --> 673.84]  every
[673.84 --> 674.00]  single
[674.00 --> 674.18]  time
[674.18 --> 674.32]  they
[674.32 --> 674.44]  do
[674.44 --> 674.60]  one
[674.60 --> 674.68]  of
[674.68 --> 674.88]  these
[674.88 --> 675.30]  big
[675.30 --> 675.80]  crazy
[675.80 --> 676.26]  YOLO
[676.26 --> 676.58]  moves
[676.58 --> 676.78]  which
[676.78 --> 676.92]  they
[676.92 --> 677.14]  do
[677.14 --> 677.52]  very
[677.52 --> 677.94]  often
[677.94 --> 679.32]  if
[679.32 --> 679.48]  it
[679.48 --> 679.80]  goes
[679.80 --> 680.14]  really
[680.14 --> 680.50]  poorly
[680.50 --> 681.12]  not
[681.12 --> 681.32]  only
[681.32 --> 681.56]  does
[681.56 --> 681.88]  their
[681.88 --> 682.70]  management
[682.70 --> 683.34]  absorb
[683.34 --> 683.90]  the
[683.90 --> 684.56]  failure
[684.56 --> 684.94]  but
[684.94 --> 685.22]  they
[685.22 --> 685.46]  have
[685.46 --> 685.64]  the
[685.64 --> 685.82]  money
[685.82 --> 686.02]  in
[686.02 --> 686.14]  the
[686.14 --> 686.46]  bank
[686.46 --> 687.14]  to
[687.14 --> 687.88]  have
[687.88 --> 688.24]  that
[688.24 --> 689.38]  decision
[689.38 --> 689.62]  be
[689.62 --> 689.76]  a
[689.76 --> 690.10]  problem
[690.10 --> 690.36]  and
[690.36 --> 690.48]  be
[690.48 --> 690.60]  able
[690.60 --> 690.74]  to
[690.74 --> 691.02]  continue
[691.02 --> 691.30]  moving
[691.30 --> 691.74]  forward
[691.74 --> 693.18]  they
[693.18 --> 695.50]  don't
[695.50 --> 695.66]  seem
[695.66 --> 695.96]  to play
[695.96 --> 696.18]  that
[696.18 --> 696.50]  game
[696.50 --> 696.78]  though
[696.78 --> 697.52]  like
[697.52 --> 698.40]  Apple
[698.40 --> 698.78]  doesn't
[698.78 --> 699.08]  even
[699.08 --> 699.72]  acknowledge
[699.72 --> 701.10]  mistakes
[701.10 --> 702.04]  like
[702.04 --> 702.60]  that's
[702.60 --> 702.86]  part
[702.86 --> 702.94]  of
[702.94 --> 703.08]  their
[703.08 --> 703.56]  image
[703.56 --> 704.38]  do
[704.38 --> 704.92]  remember
[704.92 --> 705.28]  the
[705.28 --> 706.02]  antenna
[706.02 --> 706.56]  problems
[706.56 --> 706.76]  and
[706.76 --> 707.00]  stuff
[707.00 --> 707.22]  like
[707.22 --> 707.64]  holding
[707.64 --> 707.82]  the
[707.82 --> 708.04]  phone
[708.04 --> 708.28]  wrong
[708.28 --> 708.74]  it's
[708.74 --> 709.24]  your fault
[709.24 --> 709.80]  100%
[709.80 --> 710.12]  I mean
[710.12 --> 710.50]  that was
[710.50 --> 710.86]  way back
[710.86 --> 711.14]  with the
[711.14 --> 711.94]  iPhone 4
[711.94 --> 712.20]  though
[712.20 --> 712.82]  or 4S
[712.82 --> 713.14]  I think
[713.14 --> 713.44]  whatever
[713.44 --> 714.10]  I mean
[714.10 --> 714.38]  it's
[714.38 --> 714.58]  happened
[714.58 --> 715.18]  more recently
[715.18 --> 715.70]  than that
[715.70 --> 715.96]  you look
[715.96 --> 716.18]  at the
[716.18 --> 716.84]  trash can
[716.84 --> 717.38]  the trash
[717.38 --> 717.52]  can
[717.52 --> 717.78]  was a
[717.78 --> 717.90]  rare
[717.90 --> 718.20]  exception
[718.20 --> 718.50]  actually
[718.50 --> 718.66]  they
[718.66 --> 718.82]  did
[718.82 --> 719.58]  eventually
[719.58 --> 720.50]  once
[720.50 --> 720.84]  they had
[720.84 --> 721.16]  a product
[721.16 --> 721.38]  in the
[721.38 --> 721.70]  pipeline
[721.70 --> 722.62]  they did
[722.62 --> 723.58]  eventually
[723.58 --> 724.20]  acknowledge
[724.20 --> 724.58]  that it
[724.58 --> 724.80]  was
[724.80 --> 725.58]  terrible
[725.58 --> 726.88]  and
[726.88 --> 727.16]  then
[727.16 --> 727.48]  more
[727.48 --> 727.92]  recently
[727.92 --> 728.24]  you've
[728.24 --> 728.38]  got
[728.38 --> 728.54]  the
[728.54 --> 728.90]  keyboards
[728.90 --> 729.22]  on
[729.22 --> 729.40]  the
[729.40 --> 729.66]  last
[729.66 --> 730.00]  couple
[730.00 --> 730.12]  of
[730.12 --> 730.48]  generations
[730.48 --> 730.66]  of
[730.66 --> 730.90]  MacBook
[730.90 --> 731.28]  Pros
[731.28 --> 731.84]  they
[731.84 --> 732.06]  have
[732.06 --> 732.34]  fixed
[732.34 --> 732.50]  it
[732.50 --> 732.78]  now
[732.78 --> 733.10]  in the
[733.10 --> 733.34]  last
[733.34 --> 733.60]  I think
[733.60 --> 733.92]  two
[733.92 --> 734.20]  gens
[734.20 --> 734.44]  it's
[734.44 --> 734.76]  fixed
[734.76 --> 735.38]  but
[735.38 --> 735.90]  they
[735.90 --> 736.18]  just
[736.18 --> 737.04]  kept
[737.04 --> 738.10]  revising
[738.10 --> 738.30]  the
[738.30 --> 738.60]  product
[738.60 --> 738.80]  they
[738.80 --> 739.06]  kept
[739.06 --> 739.48]  shipping
[739.48 --> 739.82]  them
[739.82 --> 740.36]  they
[740.36 --> 740.56]  just
[740.56 --> 740.82]  kept
[740.82 --> 741.14]  shipping
[741.14 --> 741.46]  them
[741.46 --> 742.08]  and
[742.08 --> 742.76]  they
[742.76 --> 743.22]  absorbed
[743.22 --> 743.54]  the
[743.54 --> 743.94]  cost
[743.94 --> 744.20]  in
[744.20 --> 744.62]  their
[744.62 --> 745.08]  own
[745.08 --> 745.42]  way
[745.42 --> 745.88]  so
[745.88 --> 746.00]  they
[746.00 --> 746.16]  just
[746.16 --> 746.40]  keep
[746.40 --> 746.84]  selling
[746.84 --> 747.16]  it
[747.16 --> 747.52]  so
[747.52 --> 747.66]  they
[747.66 --> 747.88]  keep
[747.88 --> 748.10]  having
[748.10 --> 748.28]  the
[748.28 --> 748.62]  revenue
[748.62 --> 749.28]  but
[749.28 --> 749.42]  then
[749.42 --> 749.58]  they
[754.20 --> 755.58]  which
[755.58 --> 755.86]  is
[755.86 --> 756.98]  bizarre
[756.98 --> 757.60]  to me
[757.60 --> 757.84]  but
[757.84 --> 758.64]  that's
[758.64 --> 759.76]  Apple's
[759.76 --> 760.48]  approach
[760.48 --> 761.00]  I don't
[761.00 --> 761.28]  think
[761.28 --> 761.50]  they
[761.50 --> 761.90]  have
[761.90 --> 762.36]  the
[762.36 --> 763.46]  humility
[763.46 --> 764.82]  to
[764.82 --> 765.24]  release
[765.24 --> 765.66]  something
[765.66 --> 766.08]  and
[766.08 --> 766.36]  not
[766.36 --> 766.58]  be
[766.58 --> 766.84]  sure
[766.84 --> 767.00]  if
[767.00 --> 767.16]  it's
[767.16 --> 767.34]  going
[767.34 --> 767.48]  to
[767.48 --> 767.60]  be
[767.60 --> 767.76]  a
[767.76 --> 768.30]  success
[768.30 --> 769.44]  and
[769.44 --> 769.80]  be
[769.80 --> 770.18]  willing
[770.18 --> 770.48]  to
[770.48 --> 770.94]  dispel
[770.94 --> 771.78]  problems
[771.78 --> 772.52]  a bit
[772.52 --> 772.84]  of a
[772.84 --> 773.18]  recurring
[773.18 --> 773.52]  theme
[773.52 --> 773.70]  with
[773.70 --> 774.02]  Apple
[774.02 --> 774.38]  too
[774.38 --> 775.56]  knowingly
[775.56 --> 775.96]  using
[775.96 --> 776.38]  child
[776.38 --> 776.62]  labor
[776.62 --> 776.86]  for
[776.86 --> 777.12]  three
[777.12 --> 777.54]  years
[777.54 --> 779.30]  after
[779.30 --> 779.68]  saying
[779.68 --> 779.90]  that
[779.90 --> 780.12]  they
[780.12 --> 780.42]  were
[780.42 --> 781.44]  using
[781.44 --> 781.66]  the
[781.66 --> 781.94]  highest
[781.94 --> 782.46]  standards
[782.46 --> 783.12]  for
[783.12 --> 784.40]  partnership
[784.40 --> 784.96]  integrity
[784.96 --> 785.44]  so
[785.44 --> 786.44]  I just
[786.44 --> 786.76]  wanted to
[786.76 --> 787.14]  throw
[787.14 --> 787.50]  that
[787.50 --> 787.88]  little
[787.88 --> 789.38]  comment
[789.38 --> 789.78]  in there
[789.78 --> 789.98]  I don't
[789.98 --> 790.16]  think
[790.16 --> 791.42]  there's
[791.42 --> 791.80]  a lot
[791.80 --> 791.94]  of
[791.94 --> 792.34]  details
[792.34 --> 792.66]  really
[792.66 --> 792.84]  so
[792.84 --> 793.00]  I don't
[793.00 --> 793.16]  think
[793.16 --> 793.32]  it's
[793.32 --> 793.44]  its
[793.44 --> 793.68]  own
[793.68 --> 793.86]  topic
[793.86 --> 794.12]  it is
[794.12 --> 794.36]  in the
[794.36 --> 794.58]  doc
[794.58 --> 795.00]  actually
[795.00 --> 796.38]  oh
[796.38 --> 796.70]  yeah
[796.70 --> 796.96]  we can
[796.96 --> 797.40]  talk
[797.40 --> 797.62]  about
[797.62 --> 797.80]  that
[797.80 --> 798.04]  a little
[798.04 --> 798.20]  bit
[798.20 --> 798.40]  more
[798.40 --> 798.74]  later
[798.74 --> 799.10]  but
[799.10 --> 799.52]  okay
[799.52 --> 799.82]  sounds
[799.82 --> 800.04]  good
[800.04 --> 800.50]  oh
[800.50 --> 800.66]  here
[800.66 --> 800.92]  it is
[800.92 --> 801.14]  yeah
[801.14 --> 801.48]  I didn't
[801.48 --> 801.72]  see it
[801.72 --> 802.06]  my bad
[802.06 --> 802.46]  so
[802.46 --> 803.28]  with
[803.28 --> 803.52]  okay
[803.52 --> 803.86]  with all
[803.86 --> 804.02]  that
[804.02 --> 804.32]  in mind
[804.32 --> 804.62]  I want
[804.62 --> 804.90]  to bet
[804.90 --> 805.68]  I want
[805.68 --> 805.96]  to bet
[805.96 --> 806.26]  so
[806.26 --> 806.46]  let's
[806.46 --> 806.68]  look at
[806.68 --> 806.78]  the
[806.78 --> 807.04]  current
[807.04 --> 807.46]  iPhone
[813.12 --> 817.44]  XR
[817.44 --> 817.86]  which is
[817.86 --> 817.98]  your
[817.98 --> 818.32]  budget
[818.32 --> 818.64]  but
[818.64 --> 818.98]  like
[818.98 --> 819.26]  kind
[819.26 --> 819.38]  of
[819.38 --> 819.54]  all
[819.54 --> 819.86]  the
[819.86 --> 820.56]  modern
[820.56 --> 821.14]  experience
[821.14 --> 821.62]  one
[821.62 --> 821.82]  we've
[821.82 --> 821.98]  got
[821.98 --> 822.24]  iPhone
[822.24 --> 822.58]  11
[822.58 --> 822.80]  it's
[822.80 --> 822.96]  pretty
[822.96 --> 823.28]  typical
[823.28 --> 823.60]  for them
[823.60 --> 823.86]  to keep
[823.86 --> 824.22]  the last
[824.22 --> 824.38]  gen
[824.38 --> 824.58]  around
[824.58 --> 824.86]  for a
[824.86 --> 825.04]  while
[825.04 --> 825.76]  that's
[825.76 --> 826.02]  not
[826.02 --> 826.78]  a new
[826.78 --> 827.08]  thing
[827.08 --> 828.08]  and
[828.08 --> 828.26]  so
[828.26 --> 828.54]  really
[828.54 --> 829.06]  in the
[829.06 --> 829.40]  new
[829.40 --> 829.84]  lineup
[829.84 --> 830.40]  you've
[830.40 --> 830.66]  got

[831.76 --> 832.20]  which
[832.20 --> 832.50]  has
[832.50 --> 832.74]  a
[832.74 --> 832.88]  more
[832.88 --> 833.26]  basic

[834.34 --> 834.58]  same
[834.58 --> 834.98]  internal
[834.98 --> 835.32]  hardware
[835.32 --> 835.50]  they're

[835.70 --> 836.08]  lightning
[836.08 --> 836.50]  fast
[836.50 --> 837.28]  so
[837.28 --> 837.42]  you've
[837.42 --> 837.50]  got

[840.10 --> 840.42]  and
[840.42 --> 840.52]  then
[840.52 --> 840.62]  you
[840.62 --> 840.74]  got

[846.28 --> 846.96]  iPhone
[846.96 --> 847.74]  iPhones
[847.74 --> 848.64]  probably
[848.64 --> 849.66]  how does
[849.66 --> 850.10]  it fit
[850.10 --> 850.72]  into
[850.72 --> 851.74]  that
[851.74 --> 852.18]  kind
[852.18 --> 852.40]  of

[859.90 --> 861.02]  oh
[861.02 --> 863.66]  my
[863.66 --> 866.50]  I would
[866.50 --> 866.88]  I would
[866.88 --> 867.80]  I almost
[867.80 --> 868.64]  I'm still
[868.64 --> 868.96]  thinking
[868.96 --> 869.36]  I'm not
[869.36 --> 869.58]  committing
[869.58 --> 869.90]  to this

[871.06 --> 871.24]  firm
[871.24 --> 871.56]  answer

[871.80 --> 871.94]  I'm
[871.94 --> 872.20]  almost
[872.20 --> 872.48]  wondering
[872.48 --> 872.70]  if
[872.70 --> 872.92]  they
[872.92 --> 873.20]  if
[873.20 --> 873.34]  they
[873.34 --> 873.58]  do
[873.58 --> 873.98]  like
[873.98 --> 874.14]  a
[874.14 --> 874.32]  new
[874.32 --> 874.58]  device
[874.58 --> 878.44]  I'm
[878.44 --> 878.68]  almost
[878.68 --> 878.88]  wondering
[878.88 --> 879.00]  if
[879.00 --> 879.10]  they
[879.10 --> 879.22]  do
[879.22 --> 879.38]  like
[879.38 --> 879.52]  a
[879.52 --> 879.68]  new
[879.68 --> 880.10]  device
[880.10 --> 880.42]  type
[880.42 --> 880.64]  of
[880.64 --> 881.14]  launch
[881.14 --> 881.58]  thing
[881.58 --> 883.12]  where
[883.12 --> 883.34]  it's
[883.34 --> 883.58]  not
[883.58 --> 883.84]  it's
[883.84 --> 884.06]  not
[884.06 --> 884.30]  even
[884.30 --> 884.66]  an
[884.66 --> 885.08]  iPhone
[885.08 --> 885.64]  it's
[885.64 --> 885.80]  like
[885.80 --> 885.96]  an
[885.96 --> 886.50]  iPod
[886.50 --> 886.88]  style
[886.88 --> 887.30]  device
[887.30 --> 887.46]  I
[887.46 --> 887.62]  didn't
[887.62 --> 887.82]  even
[887.82 --> 888.20]  think
[888.20 --> 888.36]  of
[888.36 --> 888.68]  that
[888.68 --> 890.20]  because
[890.20 --> 890.46]  that's
[890.46 --> 890.62]  one

[890.74 --> 891.08]  Apple's
[891.08 --> 891.48]  you know
[891.48 --> 891.60]  what
[891.60 --> 891.76]  that's
[891.76 --> 892.82]  a really
[892.82 --> 893.08]  good
[893.08 --> 893.34]  thought
[893.34 --> 893.76]  because
[893.76 --> 894.24]  one
[894.24 --> 894.36]  of
[894.36 --> 894.76]  Apple's
[894.76 --> 894.98]  things
[894.98 --> 895.20]  over
[895.20 --> 895.36]  the

[895.84 --> 896.10]  years
[896.10 --> 896.36]  is
[896.36 --> 896.84]  you
[896.84 --> 897.12]  don't
[897.12 --> 897.50]  with
[897.50 --> 897.64]  the
[897.64 --> 898.04]  iPhone
[898.04 --> 898.78]  right
[898.78 --> 899.64]  why
[899.64 --> 900.10]  mess
[900.10 --> 900.26]  up
[900.26 --> 900.40]  a
[900.40 --> 900.56]  good
[900.56 --> 900.82]  thing
[900.82 --> 901.24]  because

[901.90 --> 902.28]  revenue
[902.28 --> 902.58]  is
[902.58 --> 902.98]  so
[902.98 --> 903.38]  much
[903.38 --> 903.80]  more
[903.80 --> 904.28]  than

[914.66 --> 914.82]  new
[914.82 --> 915.02]  thing

[919.14 --> 919.44]  that
[924.24 --> 924.76]  of

[927.14 --> 927.96]  into
[927.96 --> 928.80]  standalone
[928.80 --> 929.96]  like
[929.96 --> 930.68]  large

[931.36 --> 932.14]  you know
[932.14 --> 932.28]  with

[933.00 --> 933.52]  AirPods
[933.52 --> 933.82]  max
[933.82 --> 934.06]  I mean
[934.06 --> 934.44]  you could
[934.44 --> 934.76]  actually
[934.76 --> 935.06]  spend
[935.06 --> 935.28]  more
[935.28 --> 935.40]  on
[935.40 --> 935.94]  accessories
[935.94 --> 936.58]  to
[936.58 --> 936.92]  connect
[936.92 --> 937.08]  to
[937.08 --> 937.22]  your
[937.22 --> 937.62]  iPhone
[937.62 --> 937.82]  than
[937.82 --> 937.92]  you
[937.92 --> 938.20]  spent
[938.20 --> 938.34]  on
[938.34 --> 938.48]  the
[938.48 --> 938.92]  iPhone
[938.92 --> 939.40]  it's
[939.40 --> 939.84]  genius
[939.84 --> 940.70]  it's
[940.70 --> 941.10]  genius
[941.10 --> 941.66]  and
[941.66 --> 941.88]  so
[941.88 --> 941.98]  yeah
[941.98 --> 942.20]  and
[942.20 --> 942.40]  like
[942.40 --> 942.76]  all
[942.76 --> 942.92]  of
[942.92 --> 943.12]  those
[943.12 --> 943.38]  things
[943.38 --> 943.52]  would
[943.52 --> 943.64]  be
[943.64 --> 944.00]  different
[944.00 --> 944.26]  for
[944.26 --> 944.56]  this
[944.56 --> 945.04]  device
[945.04 --> 945.20]  and
[945.20 --> 945.30]  you
[945.30 --> 945.52]  actually
[945.52 --> 945.76]  said
[945.76 --> 945.90]  it
[945.90 --> 946.28]  yourself
[946.28 --> 946.56]  earlier
[946.56 --> 946.84]  because
[946.84 --> 947.02]  if
[947.02 --> 947.18]  they
[947.18 --> 947.52]  called
[947.52 --> 947.70]  it
[947.70 --> 948.00]  the
[948.00 --> 948.36]  which
[948.36 --> 948.62]  I
[948.62 --> 948.80]  don't
[948.80 --> 948.96]  think
[948.96 --> 949.08]  they
[949.08 --> 949.22]  will
[954.24 --> 954.92]  that's
[954.92 --> 955.22]  true
[955.22 --> 955.38]  it's
[955.38 --> 955.44]  not
[955.44 --> 955.60]  the
[955.60 --> 956.02]  iPhone
[956.02 --> 956.48]  fold
[956.48 --> 957.04]  it's
[957.04 --> 957.16]  an
[957.16 --> 957.68]  i-fold
[957.68 --> 958.62]  so
[958.62 --> 958.84]  it's
[958.84 --> 959.10]  somewhere
[959.10 --> 959.46]  in
[959.46 --> 960.00]  between
[960.00 --> 960.44]  like
[960.44 --> 961.08]  iPhone
[961.08 --> 961.36]  and
[961.36 --> 961.72]  iPad
[961.72 --> 962.56]  and
[962.56 --> 963.16]  it
[963.16 --> 963.44]  wouldn't
[963.44 --> 963.70]  even
[963.70 --> 964.02]  be
[964.02 --> 964.34]  that
[964.34 --> 964.74]  weird
[964.74 --> 965.08]  that
[965.08 --> 965.40]  the
[965.40 --> 966.08]  waters
[966.08 --> 966.30]  are
[966.30 --> 966.52]  kind
[966.52 --> 966.64]  of
[966.64 --> 966.98]  muddied
[966.98 --> 967.10]  in
[967.10 --> 967.28]  that
[967.28 --> 967.48]  way
[967.48 --> 968.00]  because
[968.00 --> 968.80]  the
[968.80 --> 969.12]  iPad
[969.12 --> 969.80]  already
[969.80 --> 970.40]  had
[970.40 --> 970.96]  cellular
[970.96 --> 971.54]  connectivity
[971.54 --> 971.94]  for
[971.94 --> 972.36]  example
[972.36 --> 973.12]  and
[973.12 --> 973.52]  was
[973.52 --> 973.94]  already
[973.94 --> 974.62]  capable
[974.62 --> 974.98]  has
[974.98 --> 975.26]  already
[975.26 --> 975.44]  been
[975.44 --> 975.72]  capable
[975.72 --> 975.98]  for
[975.98 --> 976.38]  years
[976.38 --> 976.54]  and
[976.54 --> 976.90]  years
[976.90 --> 977.38]  even
[977.38 --> 977.54]  if
[977.54 --> 977.66]  it
[977.66 --> 977.96]  doesn't
[977.96 --> 978.10]  have
[978.10 --> 978.22]  a
[978.22 --> 978.38]  SIM
[978.38 --> 978.62]  card
[978.62 --> 978.74]  in
[978.74 --> 978.90]  it
[978.90 --> 979.40]  of
[979.40 --> 979.92]  calling
[979.92 --> 980.50]  through
[980.50 --> 981.28]  FaceTime
[981.28 --> 985.44]  so
[985.44 --> 986.34]  the
[986.34 --> 987.00]  idea
[987.00 --> 987.70]  that
[987.70 --> 988.00]  this
[988.00 --> 988.24]  could
[988.24 --> 988.44]  be
[988.44 --> 988.72]  just
[988.72 --> 989.08]  like
[989.08 --> 990.30]  another
[990.30 --> 990.96]  device
[990.96 --> 991.42]  but
[991.42 --> 991.86]  see
[991.86 --> 992.66]  that's
[992.66 --> 992.82]  where
[992.82 --> 992.92]  I
[992.92 --> 993.04]  run
[993.04 --> 993.20]  into
[993.20 --> 993.48]  trouble
[993.48 --> 993.98]  because
[993.98 --> 994.68]  that's
[994.68 --> 995.06]  also
[995.06 --> 995.36]  part
[995.36 --> 995.48]  of
[995.48 --> 995.82]  Apple's
[995.82 --> 996.26]  philosophy
[996.26 --> 996.60]  is
[996.60 --> 996.82]  that
[996.82 --> 997.26]  every
[997.26 --> 997.70]  device
[997.70 --> 997.88]  in
[997.88 --> 998.04]  their
[998.04 --> 998.46]  lineup
[998.46 --> 1000.46]  exists
[1000.46 --> 1004.24]  for
[1004.24 --> 1004.52]  a
[1004.52 --> 1005.12]  purpose
[1005.12 --> 1005.64]  and
[1005.64 --> 1005.82]  to
[1005.82 --> 1005.98]  be
[1005.98 --> 1006.26]  used
[1006.26 --> 1006.44]  with
[1006.44 --> 1006.66]  each
[1006.66 --> 1006.92]  other
[1006.92 --> 1007.24]  like
[1007.24 --> 1007.70]  it
[1007.70 --> 1007.82]  would
[1007.82 --> 1008.00]  be
[1008.00 --> 1008.40]  very
[1008.40 --> 1008.88]  normal
[1008.88 --> 1009.10]  to
[1009.10 --> 1009.28]  have

[1011.26 --> 1011.66]  and
[1011.66 --> 1012.50]  AirPods
[1012.50 --> 1014.04]  but
[1014.04 --> 1014.32]  to have

[1015.76 --> 1016.34]  is
[1016.34 --> 1016.72]  weird
[1016.72 --> 1017.64]  yes

[1138.96 --> 1139.16]  actually
[1139.16 --> 1139.50]  not a
[1139.50 --> 1139.70]  problem
[1139.70 --> 1139.86]  because
[1139.86 --> 1139.98]  they

[1140.14 --> 1140.28]  fit

[1141.30 --> 1141.92]  iPads
[1141.92 --> 1142.38]  exactly
[1142.38 --> 1142.68]  it doesn't
[1142.68 --> 1142.94]  matter
[1142.94 --> 1143.14]  that
[1143.14 --> 1143.42]  there's
[1143.42 --> 1143.92]  a bunch
[1143.92 --> 1144.02]  of

[1144.12 --> 1144.28]  they're
[1144.28 --> 1144.42]  all
[1144.42 --> 1144.78]  that's
[1144.78 --> 1144.94]  right
[1144.94 --> 1145.10]  you
[1145.10 --> 1145.22]  don't
[1145.22 --> 1145.36]  need
[1145.36 --> 1145.50]  more
[1145.50 --> 1145.64]  than
[1145.64 --> 1145.80]  one
[1145.80 --> 1145.90]  you
[1145.90 --> 1146.04]  only
[1146.04 --> 1146.22]  need
[1146.22 --> 1146.48]  one
[1146.48 --> 1146.94]  ipad
[1146.94 --> 1147.14]  because
[1147.14 --> 1147.28]  they
[1147.28 --> 1147.52]  all
[1147.52 --> 1147.64]  serve
[1147.64 --> 1147.80]  the
[1147.80 --> 1147.96]  same
[1147.96 --> 1148.30]  function
[1148.30 --> 1148.50]  and
[1148.50 --> 1148.80]  that's
[1148.80 --> 1149.04]  where
[1149.04 --> 1149.68]  that's
[1149.68 --> 1149.82]  where
[1149.82 --> 1149.98]  I
[1149.98 --> 1150.30]  think
[1150.30 --> 1150.72]  our
[1150.72 --> 1151.48]  speculation
[1151.48 --> 1152.26]  about
[1152.26 --> 1152.52]  the
[1152.52 --> 1152.80]  i
[1152.80 --> 1153.30]  fold
[1153.30 --> 1154.64]  falls
[1154.64 --> 1155.06]  apart
[1155.06 --> 1155.70]  because
[1155.70 --> 1156.74]  even
[1156.74 --> 1156.94]  though
[1156.94 --> 1157.14]  there's
[1157.14 --> 1157.24]  an
[1157.24 --> 1157.60]  ipad
[1157.60 --> 1157.90]  mini
[1157.90 --> 1158.40]  and
[1158.40 --> 1158.54]  a
[1158.54 --> 1159.00]  gigantic
[1159.00 --> 1159.60]  ipad
[1159.60 --> 1160.04]  pro
[1160.04 --> 1160.36]  which
[1160.36 --> 1160.54]  is
[1160.54 --> 1160.80]  like
[1160.80 --> 1161.34]  you
[1161.34 --> 1161.46]  know
[1161.46 --> 1161.78]  the
[1161.78 --> 1162.12]  difference
[1162.12 --> 1162.32]  in
[1162.32 --> 1162.58]  size
[1162.58 --> 1162.86]  between
[1162.86 --> 1163.08]  these
[1163.08 --> 1163.50]  devices
[1163.50 --> 1163.72]  I
[1163.72 --> 1163.80]  mean
[1163.80 --> 1163.94]  we're
[1163.94 --> 1164.20]  talking
[1164.20 --> 1164.34]  the
[1164.34 --> 1164.58]  difference
[1164.58 --> 1164.86]  between
[1164.86 --> 1165.02]  a
[1165.02 --> 1165.40]  kindle
[1165.40 --> 1165.96]  and
[1165.96 --> 1166.12]  like
[1166.12 --> 1166.28]  I
[1166.28 --> 1166.50]  remember
[1166.50 --> 1166.68]  the
[1166.68 --> 1166.86]  first
[1166.86 --> 1167.16]  time
[1167.16 --> 1167.38]  I
[1167.38 --> 1167.60]  got
[1167.60 --> 1167.72]  on
[1167.72 --> 1167.84]  a
[1167.84 --> 1168.18]  plane
[1168.18 --> 1168.42]  and
[1168.42 --> 1168.64]  saw
[1168.64 --> 1169.06]  someone
[1169.06 --> 1169.36]  like
[1169.36 --> 1169.68]  reading
[1169.68 --> 1169.88]  the
[1169.88 --> 1170.10]  news
[1170.10 --> 1170.24]  on
[1170.24 --> 1170.36]  an
[1170.36 --> 1170.66]  iPad
[1170.66 --> 1170.92]  pro
[1170.92 --> 1171.08]  like
[1171.08 --> 1171.22]  they
[1171.22 --> 1171.38]  might
[1171.38 --> 1171.52]  as
[1171.52 --> 1171.64]  well
[1171.64 --> 1171.74]  have
[1171.74 --> 1171.88]  had
[1171.88 --> 1172.02]  a
[1172.02 --> 1172.28]  freaking
[1172.28 --> 1173.68]  newspaper
[1173.68 --> 1174.40]  in
[1174.40 --> 1174.56]  their
[1174.56 --> 1174.78]  seat
[1174.78 --> 1175.24]  like
[1175.24 --> 1175.68]  it's
[1175.68 --> 1176.18]  gigantic
[1176.18 --> 1177.20]  and
[1177.20 --> 1177.74]  but
[1177.74 --> 1177.96]  even
[1177.96 --> 1178.22]  though
[1178.22 --> 1178.46]  there's
[1178.46 --> 1178.62]  such
[1178.62 --> 1178.76]  a
[1178.76 --> 1179.00]  size
[1179.00 --> 1179.40]  difference
[1179.40 --> 1180.28]  functionally
[1180.28 --> 1180.80]  they
[1180.80 --> 1181.14]  are
[1181.14 --> 1181.64]  basically
[1181.64 --> 1181.90]  the
[1181.90 --> 1182.18]  same
[1182.18 --> 1182.60]  and
[1182.60 --> 1182.84]  that's
[1182.84 --> 1182.98]  where
[1182.98 --> 1183.18]  the
[1183.18 --> 1183.88]  iFold
[1183.88 --> 1184.36]  falls
[1184.36 --> 1184.58]  into
[1184.58 --> 1184.82]  this
[1184.82 --> 1185.20]  really
[1185.20 --> 1185.70]  weird
[1185.70 --> 1186.16]  territory
[1186.16 --> 1186.40]  where
[1186.40 --> 1186.56]  when
[1186.56 --> 1186.74]  it's
[1186.74 --> 1186.98]  folded
[1186.98 --> 1187.30]  out
[1187.30 --> 1187.92]  it
[1187.92 --> 1188.08]  is
[1188.08 --> 1188.86]  functionally
[1188.86 --> 1189.02]  an
[1189.02 --> 1189.30]  iPad
[1189.30 --> 1190.16]  and
[1190.16 --> 1190.34]  when
[1190.34 --> 1190.68]  it's
[1190.68 --> 1191.06]  folded
[1191.06 --> 1191.60]  down
[1191.60 --> 1191.88]  it
[1191.88 --> 1192.06]  is
[1192.06 --> 1192.92]  functionally
[1192.92 --> 1193.46]  an
[1193.46 --> 1194.06]  iPhone
[1194.06 --> 1194.90]  and
[1194.90 --> 1195.06]  so
[1195.06 --> 1195.18]  it
[1195.18 --> 1195.44]  almost
[1195.44 --> 1195.84]  steps
[1195.84 --> 1196.14]  on
[1196.14 --> 1197.38]  both
[1197.38 --> 1198.56]  this
[1198.56 --> 1198.68]  is
[1198.68 --> 1199.08]  a
[1199.08 --> 1199.30]  bit
[1199.30 --> 1201.48]  of
[1201.48 --> 1201.76]  a
[1201.76 --> 1202.28]  side
[1202.28 --> 1202.62]  thing
[1202.62 --> 1202.86]  but
[1202.86 --> 1203.04]  there
[1203.04 --> 1203.32]  is
[1203.32 --> 1203.94]  also
[1203.94 --> 1205.50]  AirPod
[1205.50 --> 1205.78]  and
[1205.78 --> 1206.28]  Beats
[1206.28 --> 1208.46]  yeah
[1208.46 --> 1209.78]  it's
[1209.78 --> 1210.00]  a bit
[1210.00 --> 1210.22]  of a
[1210.22 --> 1210.46]  side
[1210.46 --> 1210.76]  thing
[1210.76 --> 1211.00]  but
[1211.00 --> 1211.12]  it
[1211.12 --> 1211.32]  is
[1211.32 --> 1211.46]  it
[1211.46 --> 1211.74]  is
[1211.74 --> 1212.16]  a
[1212.16 --> 1216.32]  departure
[1216.32 --> 1216.84]  from
[1216.84 --> 1217.02]  their
[1217.02 --> 1217.46]  single
[1217.46 --> 1217.90]  brand
[1217.90 --> 1218.60]  things
[1218.60 --> 1219.08]  that
[1219.08 --> 1219.38]  is
[1219.38 --> 1219.76]  true
[1219.76 --> 1220.38]  especially
[1220.38 --> 1220.98]  now
[1220.98 --> 1221.24]  with
[1221.24 --> 1221.38]  the
[1221.38 --> 1221.82]  AirPods
[1221.82 --> 1222.40]  Max
[1222.40 --> 1223.30]  like
[1223.30 --> 1223.72]  before
[1223.72 --> 1224.08]  when
[1224.08 --> 1224.46]  AirPods
[1224.46 --> 1225.00]  was
[1225.00 --> 1225.26]  more
[1225.26 --> 1225.56]  like
[1225.56 --> 1225.70]  your
[1225.70 --> 1226.30]  in-ears
[1226.30 --> 1227.10]  and
[1227.10 --> 1227.26]  I
[1227.26 --> 1227.48]  actually
[1227.48 --> 1227.90]  I
[1227.90 --> 1228.30]  didn't
[1228.30 --> 1228.46]  even
[1228.46 --> 1228.74]  talk
[1228.74 --> 1228.94]  about
[1228.94 --> 1229.16]  this
[1229.16 --> 1229.28]  in
[1229.28 --> 1229.40]  my
[1229.40 --> 1229.66]  video
[1229.66 --> 1229.82]  but
[1229.82 --> 1229.96]  I
[1229.96 --> 1230.28]  hate
[1230.28 --> 1230.44]  the
[1230.44 --> 1230.72]  branding
[1230.72 --> 1230.92]  for

[1231.02 --> 1231.34]  AirPods
[1231.34 --> 1231.72]  Max
[1231.72 --> 1232.58]  it
[1232.58 --> 1232.84]  makes
[1232.84 --> 1233.36]  no
[1233.36 --> 1233.66]  sense
[1233.66 --> 1233.82]  to
[1233.94 --> 1235.16]  AirPods
[1235.16 --> 1235.48]  are
[1235.48 --> 1235.70]  called
[1235.70 --> 1236.06]  AirPods
[1236.06 --> 1236.66]  because
[1236.66 --> 1236.98]  they're
[1236.98 --> 1237.24]  ear
[1237.24 --> 1237.64]  pods
[1237.64 --> 1238.12]  that
[1238.12 --> 1238.30]  go
[1238.30 --> 1238.46]  over
[1238.46 --> 1238.58]  the
[1238.58 --> 1238.80]  air
[1238.80 --> 1240.16]  and
[1240.16 --> 1240.68]  AirPods
[1240.68 --> 1241.18]  pros
[1241.18 --> 1241.98]  are
[1241.98 --> 1242.46]  AirPods
[1242.46 --> 1242.94]  that
[1242.94 --> 1243.04]  are
[1243.04 --> 1243.36]  better
[1243.36 --> 1244.94]  AirPods
[1244.94 --> 1245.44]  max
[1245.44 --> 1245.84]  are

[1246.12 --> 1246.76]  AirPods
[1246.76 --> 1249.00]  they're
[1249.00 --> 1249.98]  over the
[1249.98 --> 1250.14]  ear
[1250.14 --> 1250.68]  headphones
[1250.68 --> 1251.12]  they are
[1251.12 --> 1251.52]  nothing
[1251.52 --> 1251.94]  to do
[1251.94 --> 1252.12]  with
[1252.12 --> 1252.52]  ear
[1252.52 --> 1252.82]  pods
[1252.82 --> 1252.96]  and
[1252.96 --> 1253.14]  I
[1253.14 --> 1253.82]  get
[1253.82 --> 1254.00]  that
[1254.00 --> 1254.30]  Apple
[1254.30 --> 1254.48]  is
[1254.48 --> 1254.96]  their
[1254.96 --> 1255.36]  word
[1255.36 --> 1255.60]  they
[1255.60 --> 1255.82]  can
[1255.82 --> 1256.56]  decide
[1256.56 --> 1256.76]  it
[1256.76 --> 1256.96]  means
[1256.96 --> 1257.18]  whatever
[1257.18 --> 1257.36]  they
[1257.36 --> 1257.66]  want
[1257.66 --> 1257.88]  that's
[1257.88 --> 1258.02]  their
[1258.02 --> 1258.36]  right
[1258.36 --> 1259.10]  but
[1259.10 --> 1259.56]  it
[1259.56 --> 1261.98]  doesn't
[1261.98 --> 1262.36]  roll
[1262.36 --> 1262.86]  across
[1262.86 --> 1263.60]  the
[1263.60 --> 1263.94]  tongue
[1263.94 --> 1264.68]  naturally
[1264.68 --> 1264.98]  like
[1264.98 --> 1266.26]  and it
[1266.26 --> 1266.64]  kind of
[1266.64 --> 1267.00]  breaks
[1267.00 --> 1267.58]  their own
[1267.58 --> 1268.00]  naming
[1268.00 --> 1268.40]  scheme
[1268.40 --> 1268.62]  like
[1268.62 --> 1268.72]  you
[1268.72 --> 1268.84]  look
[1268.84 --> 1268.94]  at
[1268.94 --> 1269.38]  iPhone
[1269.38 --> 1269.54]  and
[1269.54 --> 1269.92]  iPhone
[1269.92 --> 1270.26]  Pro
[1270.26 --> 1270.84]  they're
[1270.84 --> 1271.12]  both
[1271.12 --> 1271.80]  fundamentally
[1271.80 --> 1272.36]  the same
[1272.36 --> 1272.66]  thing
[1272.66 --> 1273.16]  but one's
[1273.16 --> 1273.74]  like a bit
[1273.74 --> 1274.22]  more better
[1274.22 --> 1275.52]  whereas
[1275.52 --> 1276.58]  and then
[1276.58 --> 1277.02]  iPhone
[1277.02 --> 1277.88]  Pro Max
[1277.88 --> 1278.50]  is like
[1278.50 --> 1279.14]  the a bit
[1279.14 --> 1279.54]  more better
[1279.54 --> 1279.88]  one but
[1279.88 --> 1280.30]  like bigger
[1280.30 --> 1281.92]  and so
[1281.92 --> 1282.46]  I get
[1282.46 --> 1282.90]  from like
[1282.90 --> 1283.50]  a functionality
[1283.50 --> 1284.24]  standpoint
[1284.24 --> 1285.08]  if what
[1285.08 --> 1285.56]  makes it
[1285.56 --> 1285.96]  Pro
[1285.96 --> 1286.54]  is active
[1286.54 --> 1286.78]  noise
[1286.78 --> 1287.32]  cancellation
[1287.32 --> 1288.80]  then
[1288.80 --> 1289.40]  sure
[1289.40 --> 1289.82]  yeah
[1289.82 --> 1290.26]  then wait
[1290.26 --> 1290.62]  should it
[1290.62 --> 1290.94]  be
[1290.94 --> 1291.24]  wait
[1291.24 --> 1291.56]  should they
[1291.56 --> 1291.68]  be
[1291.68 --> 1292.02]  AirPods
[1292.02 --> 1292.70]  Pro
[1292.70 --> 1293.62]  Max
[1293.62 --> 1293.96]  then
[1293.96 --> 1295.40]  they sure
[1295.40 --> 1295.64]  as heck
[1295.64 --> 1295.92]  shouldn't be
[1295.92 --> 1296.82]  AirPods Max
[1296.82 --> 1297.98]  so
[1297.98 --> 1299.86]  both the
[1299.86 --> 1300.22]  physical
[1300.22 --> 1300.84]  design
[1300.84 --> 1301.32]  and the
[1301.32 --> 1301.88]  functionality
[1301.88 --> 1302.52]  like it
[1302.52 --> 1302.70]  just
[1302.70 --> 1303.06]  ah it
[1303.06 --> 1303.24]  doesn't
[1303.24 --> 1303.40]  really
[1303.40 --> 1303.58]  work
[1303.58 --> 1303.76]  but
[1303.76 --> 1304.26]  I mean
[1304.26 --> 1304.50]  Apple
[1304.50 --> 1305.52]  to temporarily
[1305.52 --> 1305.98]  move away
[1305.98 --> 1306.24]  from the
[1306.24 --> 1306.60]  branding
[1306.60 --> 1307.30]  comment
[1307.30 --> 1308.50]  what we were
[1308.50 --> 1308.86]  talking about
[1308.86 --> 1309.14]  earlier
[1309.14 --> 1309.98]  like if we
[1309.98 --> 1310.26]  go into
[1310.26 --> 1310.66]  this music
[1310.66 --> 1311.04]  section
[1311.04 --> 1311.22]  and we're
[1311.22 --> 1311.56]  talking about
[1311.56 --> 1311.96]  individually
[1311.96 --> 1312.40]  named
[1312.40 --> 1312.88]  things
[1312.88 --> 1313.72]  having
[1313.72 --> 1315.62]  a HomePod
[1315.62 --> 1317.10]  and having
[1317.10 --> 1318.90]  one of the
[1318.90 --> 1319.28]  AirPods
[1319.28 --> 1320.36]  even if you
[1320.36 --> 1320.86]  got the
[1320.86 --> 1321.28]  AirPods
[1321.28 --> 1322.60]  or AirPods
[1322.60 --> 1322.90]  Pro
[1322.90 --> 1323.42]  and an
[1323.42 --> 1324.14]  AirPods Max
[1324.14 --> 1324.66]  I could even
[1324.66 --> 1325.56]  understand that
[1325.56 --> 1326.08]  maybe
[1326.08 --> 1326.62]  totally
[1326.62 --> 1327.32]  oh I can
[1327.32 --> 1327.80]  100%
[1327.80 --> 1328.52]  understand that
[1328.52 --> 1328.94]  there's a
[1328.94 --> 1329.68]  very different
[1329.68 --> 1330.50]  use case
[1330.50 --> 1330.82]  for those
[1330.82 --> 1331.00]  two
[1331.00 --> 1331.34]  they're very
[1331.34 --> 1331.86]  different things
[1331.86 --> 1332.10]  yeah
[1332.10 --> 1333.14]  but the whole
[1333.14 --> 1334.04]  beat section
[1334.04 --> 1334.84]  is weird
[1334.84 --> 1335.56]  so there is
[1335.56 --> 1336.36]  at least
[1336.36 --> 1336.84]  one
[1336.84 --> 1337.22]  it's not
[1337.22 --> 1337.70]  the same
[1337.70 --> 1338.10]  but there's
[1338.10 --> 1338.52]  at least
[1338.52 --> 1338.98]  one
[1338.98 --> 1339.62]  at least
[1339.62 --> 1339.98]  somewhat
[1339.98 --> 1340.42]  breakout
[1340.42 --> 1341.16]  from
[1341.16 --> 1341.82]  the
[1341.82 --> 1342.18]  standard
[1342.18 --> 1343.40]  do you
[1343.40 --> 1343.82]  think
[1343.82 --> 1344.38]  that
[1344.38 --> 1345.40]  beats
[1345.40 --> 1345.88]  just
[1345.88 --> 1346.48]  goes
[1346.48 --> 1346.90]  away
[1346.90 --> 1347.58]  eventually
[1347.58 --> 1348.74]  I think
[1348.74 --> 1348.98]  so
[1348.98 --> 1349.50]  personally
[1349.50 --> 1350.66]  I mean
[1350.66 --> 1350.96]  they're not
[1350.96 --> 1351.56]  like the fact
[1351.56 --> 1352.12]  that they have
[1352.12 --> 1352.62]  all these
[1352.62 --> 1353.28]  different types
[1353.28 --> 1353.82]  of beats
[1353.82 --> 1354.60]  they even
[1354.60 --> 1355.04]  have the
[1355.04 --> 1355.80]  like full
[1355.80 --> 1357.22]  over the
[1357.22 --> 1357.90]  head band
[1357.90 --> 1358.56]  all that
[1358.56 --> 1358.76]  kind of
[1358.76 --> 1359.00]  stuff
[1359.00 --> 1359.28]  they have
[1359.28 --> 1359.56]  a whole
[1359.56 --> 1359.78]  bunch
[1359.78 --> 1360.08]  of different
[1360.08 --> 1360.32]  types
[1360.32 --> 1360.74]  of smaller
[1360.74 --> 1361.08]  ones
[1361.08 --> 1361.38]  blah blah
[1361.38 --> 1361.50]  blah
[1361.50 --> 1361.62]  blah
[1361.62 --> 1362.52]  but they're
[1362.52 --> 1363.00]  all tucked
[1363.00 --> 1363.28]  away
[1363.28 --> 1363.74]  in the
[1363.74 --> 1364.04]  beat
[1364.04 --> 1364.52]  section
[1364.52 --> 1365.24]  which is
[1365.24 --> 1365.52]  on the
[1365.52 --> 1365.98]  far
[1365.98 --> 1366.42]  right
[1366.42 --> 1367.44]  kind of
[1367.44 --> 1367.74]  on its
[1367.74 --> 1368.00]  own
[1368.00 --> 1368.64]  and then
[1368.64 --> 1369.10]  all the
[1369.10 --> 1369.62]  airpods
[1369.62 --> 1370.06]  have their
[1370.06 --> 1370.38]  own
[1370.38 --> 1371.04]  buttons
[1371.04 --> 1371.50]  like
[1371.50 --> 1372.06]  yeah
[1372.06 --> 1372.70]  they're
[1372.70 --> 1373.06]  clearly
[1373.06 --> 1373.66]  not giving
[1373.66 --> 1374.30]  it as
[1374.30 --> 1374.86]  much attention
[1374.86 --> 1375.20]  as the
[1375.20 --> 1375.78]  other sections
[1375.78 --> 1376.60]  it was
[1376.60 --> 1377.08]  honestly
[1377.08 --> 1378.02]  really strange
[1378.02 --> 1378.28]  to me
[1378.28 --> 1378.62]  I do
[1378.62 --> 1379.08]  wonder
[1379.08 --> 1379.76]  like what
[1379.76 --> 1380.08]  the
[1380.08 --> 1380.58]  what the
[1380.58 --> 1381.04]  patents
[1381.04 --> 1381.50]  were that
[1381.50 --> 1381.74]  Apple
[1381.74 --> 1382.28]  were after
[1382.28 --> 1382.76]  maybe
[1382.76 --> 1383.68]  or something
[1383.68 --> 1384.08]  like it
[1384.08 --> 1384.24]  was
[1384.24 --> 1384.96]  it was
[1384.96 --> 1385.38]  very
[1385.38 --> 1386.14]  baffling
[1386.14 --> 1386.50]  to me
[1386.50 --> 1387.14]  that Apple
[1387.14 --> 1388.42]  the king
[1388.42 --> 1389.16]  of building
[1389.16 --> 1389.84]  branding
[1389.84 --> 1391.06]  bought
[1391.06 --> 1392.04]  what it was
[1392.04 --> 1392.64]  essentially
[1392.64 --> 1393.34]  a brand
[1393.34 --> 1394.38]  I think
[1394.38 --> 1394.66]  it wanted
[1394.66 --> 1395.24]  to just
[1395.24 --> 1397.96]  I think
[1397.96 --> 1398.42]  Beats
[1398.42 --> 1399.18]  had a lot
[1399.18 --> 1399.60]  of the
[1399.60 --> 1399.98]  mental
[1399.98 --> 1400.40]  market
[1400.40 --> 1400.80]  share
[1400.80 --> 1401.72]  that Apple
[1401.72 --> 1402.16]  usually
[1402.16 --> 1402.66]  wants
[1402.66 --> 1403.06]  so did
[1403.06 --> 1403.38]  they buy
[1403.38 --> 1403.70]  it to
[1403.70 --> 1404.18]  kill it
[1404.18 --> 1405.64]  to kill
[1405.64 --> 1405.94]  it or
[1405.94 --> 1406.34]  just to
[1406.34 --> 1406.90]  take that
[1406.90 --> 1407.16]  mental
[1407.16 --> 1407.46]  market
[1407.46 --> 1407.64]  share
[1407.64 --> 1408.06]  because I
[1408.06 --> 1408.24]  think
[1408.24 --> 1409.42]  that type
[1409.42 --> 1410.04]  of market
[1410.04 --> 1410.40]  share that
[1410.40 --> 1410.88]  they had
[1410.88 --> 1411.58]  which was
[1411.58 --> 1411.94]  like
[1411.94 --> 1414.04]  who cares
[1414.04 --> 1414.44]  about the
[1414.44 --> 1414.92]  cost
[1414.92 --> 1415.90]  I need
[1415.90 --> 1416.46]  this product
[1416.46 --> 1417.02]  because everyone
[1417.02 --> 1417.44]  else has
[1417.44 --> 1418.02]  this product
[1418.02 --> 1418.58]  yeah
[1418.58 --> 1419.48]  which is
[1419.48 --> 1419.92]  often
[1419.92 --> 1420.32]  the
[1420.32 --> 1421.26]  angle
[1421.26 --> 1421.58]  that I
[1421.58 --> 1421.88]  feel like
[1421.88 --> 1422.18]  the Apple
[1422.18 --> 1422.54]  marketing
[1422.54 --> 1422.86]  kind of
[1422.86 --> 1423.32]  goes with
[1423.32 --> 1423.88]  very similar
[1423.88 --> 1424.24]  demo
[1424.24 --> 1425.28]  absolutely
[1425.28 --> 1425.92]  had that
[1425.92 --> 1426.64]  they owned
[1426.64 --> 1426.82]  it
[1426.82 --> 1427.30]  completely
[1427.30 --> 1428.02]  absolutely
[1428.02 --> 1428.74]  so I
[1428.74 --> 1429.00]  think
[1429.00 --> 1429.48]  I think
[1429.48 --> 1429.78]  Apple
[1429.78 --> 1430.18]  was like
[1430.18 --> 1430.50]  this is
[1430.50 --> 1431.04]  the easiest
[1431.04 --> 1431.74]  we
[1431.74 --> 1432.56]  buy them
[1432.56 --> 1432.92]  and then
[1432.92 --> 1433.38]  we own
[1433.38 --> 1433.66]  that
[1433.66 --> 1434.30]  and if
[1434.30 --> 1434.62]  we want
[1434.62 --> 1434.96]  to like
[1434.96 --> 1435.36]  work on
[1435.36 --> 1435.50]  our
[1435.50 --> 1435.76]  branding
[1435.76 --> 1436.06]  and make
[1436.06 --> 1436.36]  it better
[1436.36 --> 1436.72]  sure
[1436.72 --> 1437.08]  but we
[1437.08 --> 1437.44]  keep it
[1437.44 --> 1437.62]  there
[1437.62 --> 1437.88]  so that
[1437.88 --> 1438.34]  we own
[1438.34 --> 1438.72]  that
[1438.72 --> 1439.60]  and we
[1439.60 --> 1440.08]  slow
[1440.08 --> 1440.42]  boil
[1440.42 --> 1441.28]  this frog
[1441.28 --> 1441.96]  where
[1441.96 --> 1442.86]  eventually
[1442.86 --> 1443.80]  Beats
[1443.80 --> 1444.32]  is not
[1444.32 --> 1444.92]  the cool
[1444.92 --> 1445.40]  sexy
[1445.40 --> 1446.08]  headphones
[1446.08 --> 1446.60]  to wear
[1446.60 --> 1447.68]  and Apple
[1447.68 --> 1448.08]  headphones
[1448.08 --> 1448.38]  are the
[1448.38 --> 1448.86]  cool sexy
[1448.86 --> 1449.18]  headphones
[1449.18 --> 1449.52]  to wear
[1449.52 --> 1450.16]  and you
[1450.16 --> 1450.60]  think about
[1450.60 --> 1450.90]  it
[1450.90 --> 1451.54]  from
[1451.54 --> 1452.34]  like an
[1452.34 --> 1452.64]  Apple
[1452.64 --> 1453.20]  perspective
[1453.20 --> 1453.90]  what did
[1453.90 --> 1454.12]  they pay
[1454.12 --> 1454.44]  a billion
[1454.44 --> 1454.88]  dollars
[1454.88 --> 1456.16]  like
[1456.16 --> 1456.64]  yeah
[1456.64 --> 1457.04]  so like
[1457.04 --> 1457.38]  whatever
[1457.38 --> 1458.04]  yeah
[1458.04 --> 1458.60]  to
[1458.60 --> 1460.62]  Dr. Dre
[1460.62 --> 1461.06]  that's
[1461.06 --> 1461.56]  a lot
[1461.56 --> 1461.82]  of money
[1461.82 --> 1462.16]  Dre's
[1462.16 --> 1463.12]  stoked
[1463.12 --> 1464.06]  and like
[1464.06 --> 1464.56]  I'm sure
[1464.56 --> 1465.08]  other people
[1465.08 --> 1465.40]  that were
[1465.40 --> 1465.92]  invested in
[1465.92 --> 1466.36]  that are
[1466.36 --> 1466.82]  stoked
[1466.82 --> 1467.46]  but
[1467.46 --> 1468.24]  Apple
[1468.24 --> 1469.46]  they got
[1469.46 --> 1470.02]  their market
[1470.02 --> 1470.40]  a billion
[1470.40 --> 1470.62]  dollars
[1470.62 --> 1471.22]  100%
[1471.22 --> 1471.74]  like what
[1471.74 --> 1472.40]  yeah
[1472.40 --> 1472.96]  one fell
[1472.96 --> 1473.46]  swoop
[1473.46 --> 1474.04]  and they got
[1474.04 --> 1474.38]  their whole
[1474.38 --> 1474.64]  thing
[1474.64 --> 1475.82]  so that's
[1475.82 --> 1477.54]  an interesting
[1477.54 --> 1478.02]  sort of
[1478.02 --> 1478.36]  take on
[1478.36 --> 1478.48]  it
[1478.48 --> 1478.98]  we haven't
[1478.98 --> 1479.22]  actually
[1479.22 --> 1479.74]  gone through
[1479.74 --> 1479.98]  a lot
[1479.98 --> 1480.16]  of the
[1480.16 --> 1480.46]  other
[1480.46 --> 1481.22]  points
[1481.22 --> 1481.52]  that are
[1481.52 --> 1481.72]  in the
[1481.72 --> 1481.92]  doc
[1481.92 --> 1482.20]  about
[1482.20 --> 1482.40]  the
[1482.40 --> 1482.70]  foldable
[1482.70 --> 1483.00]  iPhone
[1483.00 --> 1483.36]  rumor
[1483.36 --> 1484.34]  right
[1484.34 --> 1484.88]  so
[1484.88 --> 1485.24]  it's
[1485.24 --> 1485.48]  said to
[1485.48 --> 1485.78]  be a
[1485.78 --> 1486.04]  dual
[1486.04 --> 1486.38]  screen
[1486.38 --> 1486.72]  model
[1486.72 --> 1487.06]  which is
[1487.06 --> 1487.28]  likely
[1487.28 --> 1487.68]  the same
[1487.68 --> 1487.88]  dual
[1487.88 --> 1488.16]  display
[1488.16 --> 1488.74]  prototype
[1488.74 --> 1489.24]  rumored
[1489.24 --> 1489.48]  by
[1489.48 --> 1489.72]  John
[1489.72 --> 1490.12]  Prosser
[1490.12 --> 1490.48]  in June
[1490.48 --> 1490.92]  2020
[1490.92 --> 1491.50]  so it'd
[1491.50 --> 1491.60]  be
[1491.60 --> 1491.78]  kind of
[1491.78 --> 1491.92]  like
[1491.92 --> 1492.08]  the
[1492.08 --> 1492.38]  surface
[1492.38 --> 1492.78]  duo
[1492.78 --> 1493.02]  two
[1493.02 --> 1493.38]  individual
[1493.38 --> 1493.72]  screens
[1493.72 --> 1493.96]  with a
[1493.96 --> 1494.14]  hinge
[1494.14 --> 1494.34]  in the
[1494.34 --> 1494.54]  middle
[1494.54 --> 1494.98]  but when
[1494.98 --> 1495.24]  flat
[1495.24 --> 1495.60]  the display
[1495.60 --> 1495.76]  would
[1495.76 --> 1495.92]  look
[1495.92 --> 1496.32]  seamless
[1496.32 --> 1497.40]  the second
[1497.40 --> 1498.00]  prototype
[1498.00 --> 1498.32]  to have
[1498.32 --> 1498.62]  undergone
[1498.62 --> 1498.98]  testing
[1498.98 --> 1499.58]  is reportedly
[1507.54 --> 1508.00]  display
[1508.00 --> 1509.20]  previous
[1509.20 --> 1509.58]  reports
[1509.58 --> 1509.86]  have also
[1509.86 --> 1510.04]  said
[1510.04 --> 1510.24]  Apple
[1510.24 --> 1510.46]  ordered
[1510.46 --> 1511.30]  a large
[1511.30 --> 1511.68]  number
[1511.68 --> 1511.88]  of
[1511.88 --> 1512.22]  Samsung
[1512.22 --> 1512.64]  foldable
[1512.64 --> 1513.10]  mobile phone
[1513.10 --> 1513.46]  display
[1513.46 --> 1513.92]  samples
[1513.92 --> 1514.56]  for testing
[1514.56 --> 1515.02]  purposes
[1515.02 --> 1515.46]  earlier
[1515.46 --> 1515.84]  in
[1515.84 --> 1516.66]  2020
[1516.66 --> 1518.96]  I love
[1518.96 --> 1519.84]  the
[1519.84 --> 1520.42]  Z Fold
[1520.42 --> 1520.70]  2
[1520.70 --> 1521.20]  or Galaxy
[1521.20 --> 1521.52]  Fold
[1521.52 --> 1521.98]  Z 2
[1521.98 --> 1522.32]  whatever
[1522.32 --> 1522.86]  they call
[1522.86 --> 1523.24]  the stupid
[1523.24 --> 1523.38]  thing
[1523.38 --> 1523.60]  why didn't
[1523.60 --> 1523.82]  they just
[1523.82 --> 1524.06]  call it
[1524.06 --> 1524.58]  Fold 2
[1524.58 --> 1525.20]  I think
[1525.20 --> 1525.34]  it's
[1525.34 --> 1525.62]  Galaxy
[1525.62 --> 1526.06]  Z Fold
[1526.06 --> 1526.32]  2
[1526.32 --> 1528.10]  back when
[1528.10 --> 1528.50]  we actually
[1528.50 --> 1528.90]  did
[1528.90 --> 1529.44]  WAN shows
[1529.44 --> 1529.88]  from the
[1529.88 --> 1530.28]  office
[1530.28 --> 1531.18]  we were
[1531.18 --> 1531.68]  talking
[1531.68 --> 1532.60]  for a while
[1532.60 --> 1532.80]  there
[1532.80 --> 1533.08]  a few
[1533.08 --> 1533.38]  shows
[1533.38 --> 1533.76]  in a row
[1533.76 --> 1534.06]  but how
[1534.06 --> 1534.38]  we thought
[1534.38 --> 1534.72]  folding
[1534.72 --> 1535.04]  phones
[1535.04 --> 1535.42]  were going
[1535.42 --> 1535.62]  to be
[1535.62 --> 1536.00]  the future
[1536.00 --> 1536.30]  we just
[1536.30 --> 1536.50]  weren't
[1536.50 --> 1536.72]  there
[1536.72 --> 1536.98]  yet
[1536.98 --> 1538.76]  and
[1538.76 --> 1539.74]  Apple
[1539.74 --> 1540.24]  kind of
[1540.24 --> 1540.78]  makes
[1540.78 --> 1541.14]  things
[1541.14 --> 1541.66]  the now
[1541.66 --> 1542.80]  very often
[1542.80 --> 1544.62]  so they
[1544.62 --> 1545.00]  could
[1545.00 --> 1545.54]  absolutely
[1545.54 --> 1546.06]  do it
[1546.06 --> 1546.64]  when Apple
[1546.64 --> 1547.14]  does it
[1547.14 --> 1547.60]  it's
[1547.60 --> 1548.10]  mainstream
[1548.10 --> 1548.76]  it's that
[1548.76 --> 1549.10]  simple
[1549.10 --> 1550.78]  it's unclear
[1550.78 --> 1551.12]  if the
[1551.12 --> 1551.68]  two devices
[1551.68 --> 1552.88]  to have
[1552.88 --> 1553.26]  been tested
[1553.26 --> 1553.96]  had different
[1553.96 --> 1554.84]  hinge systems
[1554.84 --> 1555.22]  they are
[1555.22 --> 1555.64]  purported to
[1555.64 --> 1556.06]  be shells
[1556.06 --> 1556.54]  with very
[1556.54 --> 1556.94]  limited
[1556.94 --> 1557.42]  internals
[1557.42 --> 1557.86]  rather than
[1557.86 --> 1558.62]  fully working
[1558.62 --> 1559.10]  devices
[1559.10 --> 1559.96]  and the
[1559.96 --> 1560.42]  main purpose
[1560.42 --> 1560.66]  of the
[1560.66 --> 1560.94]  testing
[1560.94 --> 1561.28]  was to
[1561.28 --> 1561.52]  assess
[1561.52 --> 1561.72]  the
[1561.72 --> 1562.04]  durability
[1562.04 --> 1562.54]  of the
[1562.54 --> 1562.78]  Apple
[1562.78 --> 1563.14]  hinge
[1563.14 --> 1564.38]  and now
[1564.38 --> 1564.76]  the testing
[1564.76 --> 1565.32]  has concluded
[1565.32 --> 1565.74]  Apple is
[1565.74 --> 1566.28]  expected to
[1566.28 --> 1567.18]  evaluate which
[1567.18 --> 1567.66]  of the two
[1567.66 --> 1568.28]  foldable models
[1568.28 --> 1568.74]  to proceed
[1568.74 --> 1569.30]  with and only
[1569.30 --> 1569.88]  one will be
[1569.88 --> 1570.72]  carried forwards
[1570.72 --> 1571.40]  into development
[1571.40 --> 1571.96]  okay so there
[1571.96 --> 1572.24]  you go that
[1572.24 --> 1572.64]  answers our
[1572.64 --> 1573.06]  question we
[1573.06 --> 1573.24]  could have
[1573.24 --> 1573.72]  just read the
[1573.72 --> 1574.06]  doc I
[1574.06 --> 1574.60]  actually still
[1574.60 --> 1575.08]  enjoy that
[1575.08 --> 1575.36]  kind of
[1575.36 --> 1575.74]  speculation
[1575.74 --> 1576.92]  anyway it's
[1576.92 --> 1577.36]  just kind of
[1577.36 --> 1578.32]  fun because the
[1578.32 --> 1579.18]  reality of it is
[1579.18 --> 1579.92]  you know just
[1579.92 --> 1580.86]  because Apple has
[1580.86 --> 1581.38]  a working
[1581.38 --> 1582.92]  folding hinge
[1582.92 --> 1583.78]  or whatever
[1583.78 --> 1584.84]  doesn't even mean
[1584.84 --> 1585.54]  that we will see
[1585.54 --> 1586.62]  it next September
[1586.62 --> 1587.42]  it could be the
[1587.42 --> 1588.06]  September after
[1588.06 --> 1588.76]  it could be the
[1588.76 --> 1589.50]  one after that
[1589.50 --> 1591.44]  they what they
[1591.44 --> 1592.74]  do well is
[1592.74 --> 1593.28]  they wait
[1593.28 --> 1595.36]  so no Apple's
[1595.36 --> 1595.86]  not going to be
[1595.86 --> 1596.70]  the first to do
[1596.70 --> 1597.84]  an under display
[1597.84 --> 1599.26]  camera for example
[1599.26 --> 1601.42]  in fact that
[1601.42 --> 1602.14]  already exists
[1602.14 --> 1602.68]  there's a short
[1602.68 --> 1603.70]  circuit video of
[1603.70 --> 1604.82]  me unboxing an
[1604.82 --> 1605.40]  under display
[1605.40 --> 1606.20]  camera phone
[1606.20 --> 1607.88]  but Apple's going
[1607.88 --> 1608.44]  to wait till it's
[1608.44 --> 1609.46]  good the one that
[1609.46 --> 1610.20]  I unboxed
[1610.20 --> 1611.54]  not great
[1611.54 --> 1613.76]  it's like
[1613.76 --> 1615.10]  it works
[1615.10 --> 1615.90]  it works and
[1615.90 --> 1616.34]  it's like
[1616.34 --> 1617.48]  it's incredible
[1617.48 --> 1618.48]  like it's cool
[1618.48 --> 1619.74]  it's cool as heck
[1619.74 --> 1621.58]  but it's not
[1621.58 --> 1623.18]  Apple polished
[1623.18 --> 1623.84]  you know what I
[1623.84 --> 1624.06]  mean
[1624.06 --> 1625.30]  yeah for sure
[1625.30 --> 1627.80]  Apple's filed for
[1627.80 --> 1628.20]  a large number
[1628.20 --> 1628.78]  of patents
[1628.78 --> 1629.74]  blah blah blah
[1629.74 --> 1630.96]  late 2022 or
[1630.96 --> 1631.80]  2023 at the
[1631.80 --> 1632.70]  earliest says
[1632.70 --> 1634.22]  predicts UDN
[1634.22 --> 1636.52]  and in other
[1636.52 --> 1637.10]  news the
[1637.10 --> 1638.04]  artificial sun
[1638.04 --> 1638.96]  rises in the
[1638.96 --> 1639.30]  east
[1639.30 --> 1640.52]  okay what is
[1640.52 --> 1640.86]  this
[1640.86 --> 1643.18]  it's super
[1643.18 --> 1644.20]  conducting fusion
[1644.20 --> 1644.92]  device if I
[1644.92 --> 1645.56]  remember correctly
[1645.56 --> 1646.26]  it ran for yeah
[1646.26 --> 1647.10]  ran for 20
[1647.10 --> 1647.70]  seconds
[1647.70 --> 1649.46]  which is
[1649.46 --> 1650.30]  actually
[1650.30 --> 1651.90]  kind of
[1651.90 --> 1652.72]  crazy
[1652.72 --> 1655.08]  ion temperature
[1655.08 --> 1655.84]  of over a
[1655.84 --> 1656.82]  hundred million
[1656.82 --> 1657.44]  degrees
[1657.44 --> 1659.50]  wow
[1659.50 --> 1660.98]  oh my goodness
[1660.98 --> 1662.58]  their 2019
[1662.58 --> 1663.72]  operation ran
[1663.72 --> 1664.18]  for eight
[1664.18 --> 1664.56]  seconds
[1664.56 --> 1665.34]  their 2018
[1665.34 --> 1666.24]  operation ran
[1666.24 --> 1667.66]  for 1.5
[1667.66 --> 1668.24]  seconds
[1668.24 --> 1670.54]  that's
[1670.54 --> 1671.28]  that's wild
[1671.28 --> 1671.98]  the K-Star
[1671.98 --> 1672.54]  is one of the
[1672.54 --> 1673.28]  most advanced
[1673.28 --> 1674.48]  tokamak
[1674.48 --> 1675.34]  I hope I'm
[1675.34 --> 1676.00]  saying that right
[1676.00 --> 1677.10]  style reactors in
[1677.10 --> 1677.50]  the world
[1677.50 --> 1678.52]  these devices use
[1678.52 --> 1679.32]  powerful magnetic
[1679.32 --> 1680.26]  fields to shape
[1680.26 --> 1681.48]  superheated plasma
[1681.48 --> 1683.26]  into a torus
[1683.26 --> 1683.92]  ring shape
[1683.92 --> 1685.54]  the team says
[1685.54 --> 1686.14]  an improved
[1686.14 --> 1687.24]  internal transport
[1687.24 --> 1688.08]  barrier or
[1688.08 --> 1689.40]  ITB performance
[1689.40 --> 1690.16]  was the key to
[1690.16 --> 1690.80]  this most recent
[1690.80 --> 1691.22]  improvement
[1691.22 --> 1691.88]  so yeah
[1691.88 --> 1692.74]  something ran
[1692.74 --> 1694.80]  with an ion
[1694.80 --> 1695.30]  temperature of
[1695.30 --> 1695.84]  under a hundred
[1695.84 --> 1696.54]  million degrees
[1696.54 --> 1697.16]  for 20
[1697.16 --> 1698.36]  freaking seconds
[1698.36 --> 1699.34]  and they're
[1699.34 --> 1699.92]  hoping to
[1699.92 --> 1700.96]  improve stability
[1700.96 --> 1704.00]  to 300 seconds
[1704.00 --> 1704.58]  of continuous
[1704.58 --> 1705.36]  operation by
[1705.36 --> 1706.42]  2025
[1706.42 --> 1707.78]  but you can
[1707.78 --> 1708.58]  see they seem
[1708.58 --> 1709.10]  to do kind
[1709.10 --> 1709.52]  of yearly
[1709.52 --> 1710.10]  testing so
[1710.10 --> 1710.50]  we'll probably
[1710.50 --> 1711.44]  see steps along
[1711.44 --> 1712.22]  the way towards
[1712.22 --> 1713.22]  that 300 second
[1713.22 --> 1714.62]  goal as we move
[1714.62 --> 1715.32]  forward over the
[1715.32 --> 1715.56]  years
[1715.56 --> 1717.38]  so there's one
[1717.38 --> 1718.22]  small problem
[1718.22 --> 1718.82]  with current
[1718.82 --> 1719.72]  fusion reactors
[1719.72 --> 1720.62]  remember the idea
[1720.62 --> 1721.40]  behind a fusion
[1721.40 --> 1722.22]  reactor is that
[1722.22 --> 1723.04]  it's supposed to
[1723.04 --> 1723.88]  be used to
[1723.88 --> 1725.18]  generate electricity
[1725.18 --> 1729.36]  and currently
[1729.36 --> 1730.10]  they actually
[1730.10 --> 1731.90]  consume more
[1731.90 --> 1732.72]  energy than
[1732.72 --> 1733.46]  they produce
[1733.46 --> 1735.76]  the current
[1735.76 --> 1736.60]  record holder
[1736.60 --> 1737.32]  is actually
[1737.32 --> 1738.88]  the joint
[1738.88 --> 1739.88]  European torus
[1739.88 --> 1740.40]  which can
[1740.40 --> 1741.32]  produce 16
[1741.32 --> 1741.98]  megawatts of
[1741.98 --> 1742.94]  power from
[1742.94 --> 1744.30]  24 megawatts
[1744.30 --> 1745.18]  of input power
[1745.18 --> 1746.70]  so you know
[1746.70 --> 1747.66]  not exactly a
[1747.66 --> 1748.36]  perpetual motion
[1748.36 --> 1749.32]  machine just yet
[1749.32 --> 1751.96]  but hey
[1751.96 --> 1753.16]  any progress
[1753.16 --> 1754.40]  any progress
[1754.40 --> 1755.50]  in fusion
[1755.50 --> 1756.72]  power is
[1756.72 --> 1758.66]  you might say
[1758.66 --> 1761.36]  bright point
[1761.36 --> 1762.56]  for humanity
[1762.56 --> 1765.76]  but yeah
[1765.76 --> 1766.58]  it's I don't
[1766.58 --> 1766.98]  know it's
[1766.98 --> 1767.84]  it's it's not
[1767.84 --> 1769.00]  generating power
[1769.00 --> 1769.80]  right now it
[1769.80 --> 1770.44]  can only run for
[1770.44 --> 1771.08]  20 freaking
[1771.08 --> 1772.12]  seconds stuff
[1772.12 --> 1772.84]  like that but
[1772.84 --> 1773.72]  we'll get there
[1773.72 --> 1775.32]  and it's very
[1775.32 --> 1776.14]  very cool to see
[1776.14 --> 1776.78]  development in that
[1776.78 --> 1777.14]  direction
[1777.14 --> 1779.78]  oh I've been
[1779.78 --> 1780.54]  asked for an
[1780.54 --> 1781.84]  update on Tyler
[1781.84 --> 1782.70]  so we are
[1782.70 --> 1783.42]  setting a time
[1783.42 --> 1783.96]  do we have a
[1783.96 --> 1784.38]  time set
[1784.38 --> 1785.44]  for the stream
[1785.44 --> 1788.76]  next Friday I
[1788.76 --> 1788.98]  think
[1788.98 --> 1789.84]  yeah so it's
[1789.84 --> 1790.60]  tentatively set
[1790.60 --> 1791.48]  for next Friday
[1791.48 --> 1792.44]  after when show
[1792.44 --> 1793.04]  I think we're
[1793.04 --> 1794.00]  still finalizing
[1794.00 --> 1794.74]  what game we're
[1794.74 --> 1795.04]  going to be
[1795.04 --> 1795.48]  playing
[1795.48 --> 1796.70]  yes I have
[1796.70 --> 1797.70]  some some input
[1797.70 --> 1798.16]  on that which
[1798.16 --> 1798.76]  might be helpful
[1798.76 --> 1799.02]  okay
[1799.02 --> 1801.08]  his family has
[1801.08 --> 1802.44]  created a go
[1802.44 --> 1803.00]  fund me to
[1803.00 --> 1803.64]  help with some
[1803.64 --> 1804.38]  of the costs
[1804.38 --> 1805.46]  associated with
[1805.46 --> 1806.40]  bringing him back
[1806.40 --> 1807.24]  to Alberta
[1807.24 --> 1807.92]  actually is where
[1807.92 --> 1808.38]  most of his
[1808.38 --> 1809.20]  family is located
[1809.20 --> 1811.54]  as well as
[1811.54 --> 1811.90]  some of the
[1811.90 --> 1812.94]  other costs
[1812.94 --> 1813.98]  associated with
[1813.98 --> 1814.66]  people passing
[1814.66 --> 1815.94]  away and I
[1815.94 --> 1816.82]  just wanted to
[1816.82 --> 1817.62]  say you know
[1817.62 --> 1819.22]  thank you to
[1819.22 --> 1819.78]  our community
[1819.78 --> 1821.54]  for for the
[1821.54 --> 1822.62]  most part being
[1822.62 --> 1824.16]  just incredibly
[1824.16 --> 1829.48]  just great
[1829.48 --> 1831.06]  yeah just like
[1831.06 --> 1832.04]  you guys have
[1832.04 --> 1833.32]  said so much
[1833.32 --> 1834.04]  about you know
[1834.04 --> 1834.82]  what his
[1834.82 --> 1835.90]  he was behind
[1835.90 --> 1836.44]  the scenes a
[1836.44 --> 1837.48]  lot but I've
[1837.48 --> 1838.16]  seen so many
[1838.16 --> 1838.92]  stories from
[1838.92 --> 1839.62]  people about
[1839.62 --> 1840.36]  just like you
[1840.36 --> 1840.78]  know the 10
[1840.78 --> 1841.60]  second interaction
[1841.60 --> 1842.14]  they had with
[1842.14 --> 1843.42]  him at LTX or
[1843.42 --> 1845.34]  just how much
[1845.34 --> 1846.16]  they appreciated
[1846.16 --> 1847.06]  what he did
[1847.06 --> 1847.94]  even though he
[1847.94 --> 1848.56]  you know didn't
[1848.56 --> 1849.12]  get to be the
[1849.12 --> 1850.42]  face of the
[1850.42 --> 1851.30]  content or
[1851.30 --> 1851.82]  or whatever
[1851.82 --> 1853.78]  else we're
[1853.78 --> 1854.14]  going to have
[1854.14 --> 1854.60]  some time
[1854.60 --> 1854.98]  during the
[1854.98 --> 1855.40]  stream for
[1855.40 --> 1855.74]  people to
[1855.74 --> 1856.16]  talk about
[1856.16 --> 1856.92]  their experiences
[1856.92 --> 1857.84]  working with
[1857.84 --> 1858.50]  him you know
[1858.50 --> 1859.12]  not everyone
[1859.12 --> 1859.94]  has said they're
[1859.94 --> 1860.92]  comfortable sharing
[1860.92 --> 1861.78]  it themselves so
[1861.78 --> 1862.32]  I might read
[1862.32 --> 1862.76]  out some
[1862.76 --> 1863.52]  people's messages
[1863.52 --> 1864.20]  I want to
[1864.20 --> 1864.62]  talk about
[1864.62 --> 1865.08]  some of my
[1865.08 --> 1865.78]  experience working
[1865.78 --> 1866.28]  with him he
[1866.28 --> 1868.00]  was just such
[1868.00 --> 1870.16]  just such a
[1870.16 --> 1872.64]  creative he's
[1872.64 --> 1873.14]  just such a
[1873.14 --> 1874.12]  creative person
[1874.12 --> 1876.74]  yeah we're
[1876.74 --> 1877.32]  we're all
[1877.32 --> 1877.72]  going to miss
[1877.72 --> 1879.84]  him and so
[1879.84 --> 1881.28]  yeah go ahead
[1881.28 --> 1882.74]  I'm gonna I
[1882.74 --> 1883.10]  think I'm gonna
[1883.10 --> 1883.88]  save most of
[1883.88 --> 1884.52]  my stuff for
[1884.52 --> 1885.14]  for that
[1885.14 --> 1885.98]  yeah but
[1885.98 --> 1888.18]  I think Jake
[1888.18 --> 1888.86]  actually said it
[1888.86 --> 1889.62]  really well on
[1889.62 --> 1891.40]  Twitter it's an
[1891.40 --> 1892.22]  extremely genuine
[1892.22 --> 1893.24]  person that was a
[1893.24 --> 1893.90]  that was a big
[1893.90 --> 1894.96]  thing with Tyler
[1894.96 --> 1896.06]  too yeah
[1896.06 --> 1897.96]  yeah Tyler
[1897.96 --> 1900.02]  is real if
[1900.02 --> 1900.66]  you want to see
[1900.66 --> 1901.24]  if you want to
[1901.24 --> 1902.12]  see something it
[1902.12 --> 1902.76]  wasn't like
[1902.76 --> 1904.10]  necessarily received
[1904.10 --> 1904.94]  super well at the
[1904.94 --> 1905.64]  time but if you
[1905.64 --> 1906.00]  want to see
[1906.00 --> 1906.86]  something that him
[1906.86 --> 1907.48]  and I worked on
[1907.48 --> 1908.52]  that I cherish a
[1908.52 --> 1909.10]  lot personally
[1909.10 --> 1910.88]  look on
[1910.88 --> 1911.84]  Linus Hectib's
[1911.84 --> 1912.70]  channel the
[1912.70 --> 1913.80]  I think it was
[1913.80 --> 1914.20]  called the
[1914.20 --> 1914.78]  future of
[1914.78 --> 1915.76]  offline gaming
[1915.76 --> 1916.80]  it's actually a
[1916.80 --> 1917.46]  pretty cool video
[1917.46 --> 1919.52]  and him and I
[1919.52 --> 1920.70]  worked on that a
[1920.70 --> 1921.26]  lot together and
[1921.26 --> 1921.94]  he's in it a
[1921.94 --> 1922.36]  fair amount
[1922.36 --> 1923.46]  mostly in
[1923.46 --> 1924.26]  b-roll stuff
[1924.26 --> 1925.28]  but yeah
[1925.28 --> 1927.34]  yeah so
[1927.34 --> 1929.26]  next next week
[1929.26 --> 1930.42]  tentatively after
[1930.42 --> 1931.22]  WAN show is when
[1931.22 --> 1931.80]  we're we're gonna
[1931.80 --> 1932.74]  do it and
[1932.74 --> 1936.26]  yeah that's
[1936.26 --> 1937.02]  thank you thank
[1937.02 --> 1937.64]  you for asking
[1937.64 --> 1939.16]  it's not that
[1939.16 --> 1940.56]  we've forgotten
[1940.56 --> 1941.22]  or anything
[1941.22 --> 1942.42]  it's just that
[1942.42 --> 1943.58]  it's it's kind
[1943.58 --> 1944.22]  of complicated
[1944.22 --> 1946.12]  to put together
[1946.12 --> 1946.60]  you know we
[1946.60 --> 1947.04]  want to make
[1947.04 --> 1948.00]  sure that we're
[1948.00 --> 1948.90]  giving our
[1948.90 --> 1949.78]  staff an
[1949.78 --> 1950.68]  opportunity to
[1950.68 --> 1951.48]  to talk and
[1951.48 --> 1952.00]  an opportunity
[1952.00 --> 1954.38]  to to sort of
[1954.38 --> 1954.88]  share with you
[1954.88 --> 1955.60]  guys about him
[1955.60 --> 1956.10]  we want to make
[1956.10 --> 1956.90]  sure that we're
[1956.90 --> 1957.56]  working with the
[1957.56 --> 1958.48]  family in a way
[1958.48 --> 1959.36]  that's you know
[1959.36 --> 1960.36]  respectful of their
[1960.36 --> 1961.36]  needs and their
[1961.36 --> 1963.04]  privacy and you
[1963.04 --> 1964.26]  know not rushing
[1964.26 --> 1965.76]  anything and also
[1965.76 --> 1966.62]  trying to trying to
[1966.62 --> 1967.52]  get you guys closure
[1967.52 --> 1968.40]  as soon as we can
[1968.40 --> 1969.98]  so it's just it's a
[1969.98 --> 1970.76]  lot of moving parts
[1970.76 --> 1972.26]  big shout out to
[1972.26 --> 1973.16]  Yvonne for doing a
[1973.16 --> 1973.50]  lot of the
[1973.50 --> 1974.54]  coordination with
[1974.54 --> 1975.64]  between our staff
[1975.64 --> 1976.44]  and his family and
[1976.44 --> 1978.78]  everything she's got
[1978.78 --> 1979.70]  a lot on her plate
[1979.70 --> 1980.70]  right now with like
[1980.70 --> 1981.46]  accounting gear and
[1981.46 --> 1982.14]  she's actually like
[1982.14 --> 1983.08]  right next to me
[1983.08 --> 1985.08]  with a gigantic
[1985.08 --> 1986.10]  spreadsheet open right
[1986.10 --> 1987.86]  now but she's she
[1987.86 --> 1988.50]  and Tyler were
[1988.50 --> 1990.04]  actually like friends
[1990.04 --> 1990.92]  aside from just
[1990.92 --> 1991.98]  being colleagues
[1991.98 --> 1994.56]  so yeah she's
[1994.56 --> 1995.30]  she's put a lot
[1995.30 --> 1995.86]  into it
[1995.86 --> 1999.18]  in other news
[1999.18 --> 2000.76]  we have a major
[2000.76 --> 2001.70]  hedge fund that
[2001.70 --> 2002.72]  has advised Intel
[2002.72 --> 2003.82]  to outsource
[2003.82 --> 2004.76]  their CPU
[2004.76 --> 2006.56]  manufacturing and
[2006.56 --> 2007.44]  can I just take a
[2007.44 --> 2008.68]  moment before we
[2008.68 --> 2009.50]  go through this
[2009.50 --> 2011.58]  to say this is
[2011.58 --> 2013.06]  why I have never
[2013.06 --> 2013.66]  been willing to
[2013.66 --> 2014.68]  take any investment
[2014.68 --> 2015.84]  in Linus Media
[2015.84 --> 2018.46]  Group and this
[2018.46 --> 2019.76]  story is exactly
[2019.76 --> 2021.08]  why I am so
[2021.08 --> 2023.40]  yeah why I'm so
[2023.40 --> 2026.06]  glad to to not
[2026.06 --> 2028.30]  have any kind of
[2028.30 --> 2029.18]  external investment
[2029.18 --> 2030.44]  I'm not saying
[2030.44 --> 2031.18]  Intel doesn't need
[2031.18 --> 2031.96]  to change things
[2031.96 --> 2033.86]  Intel absolutely
[2033.86 --> 2034.88]  needs to make
[2034.88 --> 2036.50]  changes but to
[2036.50 --> 2037.44]  have people come
[2037.44 --> 2038.98]  in and think that
[2038.98 --> 2040.14]  just because they
[2040.14 --> 2040.92]  have a lot of
[2040.92 --> 2043.90]  money to buy my
[2043.90 --> 2045.22]  shares or invest
[2045.22 --> 2046.22]  in my company or
[2046.22 --> 2046.92]  whatever the case
[2046.92 --> 2048.16]  may be means that
[2048.16 --> 2049.60]  they have the
[2049.60 --> 2050.50]  requisite knowledge
[2050.50 --> 2051.56]  to tell me how to
[2051.56 --> 2053.48]  spend it is just
[2053.48 --> 2055.04]  I find it
[2055.04 --> 2056.88]  offensive and you
[2056.88 --> 2057.94]  know maybe there's
[2057.94 --> 2058.82]  even some kernels of
[2058.82 --> 2059.78]  truth in here like I
[2059.78 --> 2060.62]  said haven't read
[2060.62 --> 2061.76]  through it yet but
[2061.76 --> 2062.98]  just the idea of
[2062.98 --> 2063.92]  someone coming in and
[2063.92 --> 2064.78]  telling me you know
[2064.78 --> 2066.10]  no we can't pay that
[2066.10 --> 2067.44]  person that much or
[2067.44 --> 2068.98]  you know instead of
[2068.98 --> 2071.52]  investing in create a
[2071.52 --> 2072.38]  warehouse and merch
[2072.38 --> 2073.22]  you need to invest
[2073.22 --> 2074.72]  in doing you know
[2074.72 --> 2077.32]  more more fully
[2077.32 --> 2078.74]  sponsored videos for
[2078.74 --> 2081.34]  brands that force you
[2081.34 --> 2082.78]  to say things that
[2082.78 --> 2083.60]  you don't believe in
[2083.60 --> 2084.82]  you know because I
[2084.82 --> 2085.80]  can tell you guys if I
[2085.80 --> 2086.66]  wanted to make a lot
[2086.66 --> 2088.10]  more money there are a
[2088.10 --> 2089.28]  ton of brand deals
[2089.28 --> 2090.78]  that I could do that
[2090.78 --> 2092.60]  pay really well
[2092.60 --> 2094.60]  just really slimy but
[2094.60 --> 2095.86]  reduce your principles
[2095.86 --> 2097.18]  in the core idea of
[2097.18 --> 2098.22]  your operation but are
[2098.22 --> 2100.14]  just gross like there's
[2100.14 --> 2101.50]  some categories that we
[2101.50 --> 2103.18]  haven't and will never
[2103.18 --> 2105.80]  touch and it's not for
[2105.80 --> 2107.24]  it's not for lack of
[2107.24 --> 2109.04]  sometimes bidding wars
[2109.04 --> 2110.78]  to get us to you know
[2110.78 --> 2111.82]  whether it's you know
[2111.82 --> 2112.50]  I'm not going to name
[2112.50 --> 2113.48]  anyone it's just not
[2113.48 --> 2114.04]  it's just not
[2114.04 --> 2116.22]  constructive but we
[2116.22 --> 2117.14]  just we won't do it
[2117.14 --> 2119.96]  so hedge fund third
[2119.96 --> 2121.54]  point has taken a one
[2121.54 --> 2122.96]  billion dollar stake in
[2122.96 --> 2123.92]  intel that's with a b
[2123.92 --> 2125.28]  and has called the
[2125.28 --> 2126.46]  chip maker to consider
[2126.46 --> 2127.66]  shedding its
[2127.66 --> 2128.94]  manufacturing operations
[2128.94 --> 2131.26]  their ceo wrote intel a
[2131.26 --> 2132.18]  letter with a number of
[2132.18 --> 2134.12]  demands for intel chairman
[2134.12 --> 2136.74]  omar ishrak this is great
[2136.74 --> 2138.04]  this is in quotes we
[2138.04 --> 2139.36]  cannot fathom how the
[2139.36 --> 2140.60]  boards who presided over
[2140.60 --> 2142.14]  intel's decline could have
[2142.14 --> 2143.32]  permitted management to
[2143.32 --> 2144.56]  fritter away the company's
[2144.56 --> 2145.66]  leading market position
[2145.66 --> 2146.96]  loeb wrote to intel
[2146.96 --> 2148.00]  chairman omar ishrak
[2148.00 --> 2150.66]  anything more it
[2150.66 --> 2151.60]  completely agree
[2151.60 --> 2154.28]  yeah it's a fair point
[2154.28 --> 2156.28]  stakeholders will no
[2156.28 --> 2157.46]  longer tolerate such
[2157.46 --> 2159.32]  apparent abdications of
[2159.32 --> 2165.70]  duty can i can i just take a
[2165.70 --> 2168.28]  moment and say uh daniel
[2168.28 --> 2172.86]  dude kind of a douche um
[2172.86 --> 2175.36]  yeah can i just like who
[2175.36 --> 2178.18]  talks like that like what is
[2178.18 --> 2179.80]  wrong with you okay hold on it
[2179.80 --> 2181.44]  goes on though the loss of
[2181.44 --> 2182.86]  manufacturing leadership and
[2182.86 --> 2184.00]  other missteps have allowed
[2184.00 --> 2185.64]  several semiconductor competitors
[2185.64 --> 2187.72]  to leverage tsmc's and
[2187.72 --> 2189.18]  samsung's process technology
[2189.18 --> 2190.78]  prowess and gain significant
[2190.78 --> 2192.42]  market share at intel's expense
[2192.42 --> 2193.34]  loeb wrote
[2193.34 --> 2197.96]  uh-huh um so here's the thing
[2197.96 --> 2201.74]  everything that mr expert daniel
[2201.74 --> 2204.16]  loeb wrote in this letter is
[2204.16 --> 2208.16]  something that like he could have
[2208.16 --> 2210.14]  known like watching a video on
[2210.14 --> 2212.32]  gamers nexus you know like it's
[2212.32 --> 2214.20]  not not even gamers nexus no no
[2214.20 --> 2215.06]  never mind you don't have to
[2215.06 --> 2215.98]  watch steve you don't have to
[2215.98 --> 2217.36]  sit through steve's boring
[2217.36 --> 2220.34]  droning on forever in order to
[2220.34 --> 2221.46]  get this kind of information
[2221.46 --> 2222.82]  it's not boring to get this kind
[2222.82 --> 2224.80]  of information oh speaking of not
[2224.80 --> 2227.94]  boring steve okay my goodness
[2227.94 --> 2230.48]  this is this is a thing okay the
[2230.48 --> 2233.48]  dis they outdid themselves they
[2233.48 --> 2235.18]  outdid themselves on the
[2235.18 --> 2238.08]  disappointment 2020 build uh hold
[2238.08 --> 2239.48]  on a second i posted a community
[2239.48 --> 2240.94]  post about it earlier because
[2240.94 --> 2243.90]  like it's unreal you know their
[2243.90 --> 2246.16]  disappointment pc series does not
[2246.16 --> 2248.06]  get enough credit it's only got
[2248.06 --> 2250.46]  like 230 000 views but the like
[2250.46 --> 2252.26]  dislike ratio tells you everything
[2252.26 --> 2254.12]  you need to know about this video
[2254.12 --> 2256.20]  check check check this out okay
[2256.20 --> 2258.80]  hold on a second i uh okay they
[2258.80 --> 2261.96]  did like a whole thing look at
[2261.96 --> 2264.70]  this do you see this is custom these
[2264.70 --> 2267.50]  are cpus those were like rtx shroud
[2267.50 --> 2271.12]  inspired things like well this goes
[2271.12 --> 2274.62]  on for literally minutes of like
[2274.62 --> 2278.08]  steve building like a ghost pc that
[2278.08 --> 2281.02]  like it's actually it's all it's all
[2281.02 --> 2282.88]  paper and it all turns to paper and
[2282.88 --> 2284.64]  he's in this weird mirror room full of
[2284.64 --> 2287.24]  graphics cards look don't miss it go
[2287.24 --> 2289.04]  watch it even if you don't watch the
[2289.04 --> 2290.30]  rest of the video i don't care i don't
[2290.30 --> 2291.60]  blame you you know he talks forever
[2291.60 --> 2294.32]  but you gotta watch the intro because
[2294.32 --> 2297.94]  it is actually like pc enthusiast art
[2297.94 --> 2300.82]  that is the best way to describe it you
[2300.82 --> 2303.74]  need to go watch it so anyway i'm trying
[2303.74 --> 2305.22]  to think of something more mainstream
[2305.22 --> 2309.14]  like like you know gizmodo okay like
[2309.14 --> 2314.12]  what uh what's his name daniel daniel reads
[2314.12 --> 2315.96]  an article on gizmodo and like suddenly
[2315.96 --> 2318.16]  he's an expert on like you know like if
[2318.16 --> 2319.74]  you scroll this phone on reddit
[2319.74 --> 2321.86]  technology for like an hour one morning
[2321.86 --> 2323.32]  he would have been able to write this
[2323.32 --> 2325.92]  strongly worded letter um okay so i
[2325.92 --> 2327.84]  disagree with him it's just it's not
[2327.84 --> 2330.68]  necessarily a highbrow take um so in the
[2330.68 --> 2332.68]  past year in fairness in the past year
[2332.68 --> 2335.24]  intel has lost what 60 billion dollars in
[2335.24 --> 2339.30]  in market market value um the hedge fund
[2339.30 --> 2341.14]  said it was particularly concerned at the
[2341.14 --> 2343.10]  loss of talented intel saying the company
[2343.10 --> 2344.76]  had lost many of its best chip designers
[2344.76 --> 2346.62]  while the ones that remained are becoming
[2346.62 --> 2348.32]  increasingly demoralized this is
[2348.32 --> 2350.06]  actually something that i have heard
[2350.06 --> 2352.34]  through the grapevine about what's going
[2352.34 --> 2355.68]  on at intel um and i mean it's not like
[2355.68 --> 2358.54]  we didn't see that complacency five six
[2358.54 --> 2361.32]  years ago we watched it happen we watched
[2361.32 --> 2364.08]  them go from hey we need to push we need
[2364.08 --> 2367.98]  to push the limits to hey we need to i
[2367.98 --> 2372.04]  don't know not really bother because we
[2372.04 --> 2373.52]  need to we need to we need to cut costs so
[2373.52 --> 2374.66]  we can just make more money because we
[2374.66 --> 2375.80]  don't have any freaking competition
[2375.80 --> 2377.82]  so that's that's a good that's a good
[2377.82 --> 2380.72]  point um it should be noted that even if
[2380.72 --> 2382.10]  intel was to outsource their chips they
[2382.10 --> 2383.70]  don't need to be completely fabless like
[2383.70 --> 2384.46]  amd does
[2384.46 --> 2386.70]  almost a quarter of intel's wafers are
[2386.70 --> 2388.42]  currently being outsourced so they could
[2388.42 --> 2390.28]  potentially leverage tsmc to restore the
[2390.28 --> 2391.50]  competitiveness of their chips while
[2391.50 --> 2393.22]  still making lower tier processors in
[2393.22 --> 2393.42]  house
[2393.42 --> 2396.36]  but honestly i don't think that's going to
[2396.36 --> 2398.68]  fly and i think we already kind of
[2398.68 --> 2399.80]  know
[2399.80 --> 2403.28]  tsmc's take on that if i recall correctly
[2403.28 --> 2405.24]  they actually did comment on it publicly
[2405.24 --> 2406.84]  although it might actually it might have
[2406.84 --> 2408.30]  been industry scuttle but either way it
[2408.30 --> 2409.60]  sounds credible enough i think they
[2409.60 --> 2410.40]  basically said look
[2410.40 --> 2415.10]  intel is a fab company we're not going to
[2415.10 --> 2417.44]  build out capacity to serve their needs
[2417.44 --> 2419.82]  knowing that this is not a long-term
[2419.82 --> 2421.76]  partnership in the way that amd or
[2421.76 --> 2422.66]  nvidia would be
[2422.66 --> 2426.34]  you know so too bad intel you like making
[2426.34 --> 2428.78]  cpus then make cpus you don't like making
[2428.78 --> 2431.58]  cpus stop making cpus i think if i'm tsmc
[2431.58 --> 2433.58]  i'm kind of all or nothing because i've
[2433.58 --> 2436.48]  got customers coming out my butt at this
[2436.48 --> 2440.00]  point you know apple amd nvidia to name
[2440.00 --> 2441.86]  a few i mean nvidia went went samsung
[2441.86 --> 2443.98]  this time around but it's not like they're
[2443.98 --> 2446.04]  never going to work with tsmc again i'd be
[2446.04 --> 2446.46]  shocked
[2446.46 --> 2450.90]  so intel responded it was great intel
[2450.90 --> 2452.56]  welcomes input from all investors
[2452.56 --> 2454.98]  regarding enhanced shareholder value in
[2454.98 --> 2456.88]  that spirit we look forward to engaging
[2456.88 --> 2458.48]  with third point on their ideas towards
[2458.48 --> 2460.00]  that goal it's just like it's just like
[2460.00 --> 2463.84]  these are not ideas saying you know hey
[2463.84 --> 2466.72]  you need to you need to keep shrinking cpus
[2466.72 --> 2469.22]  you do you honestly think there's no one
[2469.22 --> 2473.20]  at intel who knows that like yes they made
[2473.20 --> 2475.06]  some mistakes but the mistakes that they
[2475.06 --> 2477.12]  made and this i don't know if this is a
[2477.12 --> 2479.10]  fundamental misunderstanding of like how
[2479.10 --> 2482.36]  cpu design and manufacturing works if intel
[2482.36 --> 2484.98]  doesn't have a competitive product today that
[2484.98 --> 2487.76]  means they made a mistake six years ago like
[2487.76 --> 2491.62]  they they they know they are in deep hot
[2491.62 --> 2494.04]  water right now there is no way that they're
[2494.04 --> 2495.76]  not trying to fix these problems so coming
[2495.76 --> 2497.56]  in buying a big stake in the company and being
[2497.56 --> 2500.44]  like you guys should make cpus with like less
[2500.44 --> 2503.38]  nanometers we heard nanometers are bad so
[2503.38 --> 2505.50]  you need you need as few nanometers as possible
[2505.50 --> 2507.70]  it just i don't know it's just kind of silly to me
[2507.70 --> 2509.98]  so i guess third point's never going to invest in my
[2509.98 --> 2513.50]  business now that i was rude to um mr loeb but
[2513.50 --> 2515.48]  that's okay because i don't want investment in my
[2515.48 --> 2518.78]  business so i think it's fine um people on the
[2518.78 --> 2523.44]  internet aren't convinced uh tldr hedge fund wants to
[2523.44 --> 2525.74]  loot intel destroying its future competitiveness in
[2525.74 --> 2528.54]  exchange for massive payoff now uh yeah that's not a bad
[2528.54 --> 2531.52]  take um that could make sense here's another good take
[2531.52 --> 2533.38]  uh intel will write its ship given a chance
[2533.38 --> 2536.34]  uh why can't these parasites wait one to three years
[2536.34 --> 2542.26]  oh man let's say that's that that is the take of this is why
[2542.26 --> 2546.24]  linus doesn't want outside investment yeah uh does gutting national tech
[2546.24 --> 2549.58]  competency and capacity just to avoid a short-term dip in profit sound like a
[2549.58 --> 2552.98]  good idea to anyone but a filthy capitalist i added the word filthy
[2552.98 --> 2559.66]  uh these investors buying a billion dollars of intel so they can tell intel
[2559.66 --> 2562.14]  what to do that's some serious cash but
[2562.14 --> 2566.08]  based on today's market cap that's about 0.5 percent of intel that they
[2566.08 --> 2569.14]  control so uh unless they can persuade some other
[2569.14 --> 2573.02]  real investors there's no way this is going anywhere
[2573.02 --> 2576.72]  yeah that's fair enough i mean it's not like i don't think intel needs to change
[2576.72 --> 2579.40]  things they absolutely do i mean one of the things that
[2579.40 --> 2583.96]  is so telling to me okay you look at companies that are
[2583.96 --> 2587.58]  that are just killing it right now in the semiconductor space
[2587.58 --> 2596.38]  um amd ceo what's uh what's amd ceo's background luke can you recall off the top of your head
[2596.38 --> 2602.66]  act it's it's it's not business if i remember correctly i don't remember exactly what it is
[2602.66 --> 2608.44]  dr lisa suits an engineer an engineer yeah but i didn't remember of of exactly
[2608.44 --> 2613.04]  nvidia nvidia what background is what background does their ceo have again is it in finance
[2613.04 --> 2621.36]  is it does he have an mba i don't believe so engineer so to me it's just it's one of those
[2621.36 --> 2626.38]  things where it's like it's a it's a tough decision to make but i think that you need to
[2626.38 --> 2633.42]  electrical engineering for dr sue you need to put engineers back in charge of intel because
[2633.42 --> 2640.02]  business people are great at maximizing profits but that's a short-term thing if you want
[2640.02 --> 2645.24]  great products which is ultimately how you make a profit then you need to put smart people who
[2645.24 --> 2649.82]  actually know how the products are built in charge you need to put people who know what the
[2649.82 --> 2657.26]  products are for in charge and well good luck intel i mean i'm really i you know i'm rooting for you
[2657.26 --> 2663.24]  because you see what happened the second amd didn't have a competitor they increased the price of
[2663.24 --> 2669.08]  their entire lineup by 50 bucks it's not like amd's like the good guy it's not like their it's not
[2669.08 --> 2675.26]  like their reason for existing is to save you a buck amd is out to make money just like intel
[2675.26 --> 2681.40]  surprise surprise so we need both of them competitive now with that said i think intel
[2681.40 --> 2686.86]  could stand to be humbled for a couple of years that would be a good experience for them i think
[2686.86 --> 2691.80]  they could stand to really lose some big market share and hopefully something that they would like
[2691.80 --> 2697.74]  define in their history as a reason to not do certain things in the future exactly like something
[2697.74 --> 2703.32]  they are not going to freaking forget but i i don't know i don't know if i can i don't know if
[2703.32 --> 2709.76]  i can count on that uh we should oh we should do sponsors oh my goodness okay the show is brought to
[2709.76 --> 2720.10]  you today by oh balls that is not the right sponsor and i'm in trouble i used entirely the wrong folder
[2720.10 --> 2729.46]  to copy over my sponsor thingamaboobers uh-huh so try to take a topic well no no i got this so i'm just
[2729.46 --> 2737.22]  gonna do that the show is brought to you today by redux redux is a pc builder striving to bring pc
[2737.22 --> 2744.50]  gaming to the masses there is no price markup on the parts just a 75 build fee so you select your budget
[2744.50 --> 2749.56]  pick your games you want to play see how they perform and then let them build your pc their
[2749.56 --> 2753.92]  online configurator allows you to customize what's going inside based on the games you want to play
[2753.92 --> 2759.74]  and redux gives you a two-year warranty on parts and labor so why wait start your build at redux build
[2759.74 --> 2769.62]  redux.com slash linus and um got a little secret for you ladies and gentlemen uh oh my it's digital storm
[2769.62 --> 2776.94]  so it's like it's like good you know yeah so like for realsies though these aren't just like some
[2776.94 --> 2782.74]  random like nobody pc builder it's like it's like good stuff so you want it you want to get you want
[2782.74 --> 2788.94]  to get in on that you want to get in on that uh okay uh no no honey today uh we got uh not that either
[2788.94 --> 2796.18]  see sonic oh yeah see sonic see sonic power supplies available with up to 80 plus titanium efficiency
[2796.18 --> 2801.00]  that's like the highest level of 80 plus certification okay we're talking efficiency
[2801.00 --> 2808.78]  level a right okay efficiency level a they got the lambda noise level a plus plus okay noise output
[2808.78 --> 2814.86]  below 20 decibels during operation fluid dynamic band look i could talk all day about all the like
[2814.86 --> 2820.68]  individual features the reality of it is see sonic is an actual power supply manufacturer who has
[2820.68 --> 2825.48]  actually been making power supplies for as long as i've been alive they're really good at it they build
[2825.48 --> 2831.88]  power supplies not just for themselves but for tons of like brands that you know that make good
[2831.88 --> 2837.18]  power supplies um their own models are available with up to 12 year warranties and you can check
[2837.18 --> 2843.14]  them out at see sonic.com or at the amazon link in the video description always love see sonic stuff
[2843.14 --> 2848.14]  everything from their very high-end stuff all the way back to like it was it was like if you could
[2848.14 --> 2852.72]  get the see sonic like the oem ones with just like the gray chassis i'm talking like 10 years ago
[2852.72 --> 2859.98]  um you could get them for just like eight to twelve dollars more than like the actual sorry who the f is
[2859.98 --> 2866.12]  this uh power supplies and i would just always be like look please to clients yeah definitely please
[2866.12 --> 2871.40]  spend the extra little bit get a see sonic because i don't want you coming back here with a broken system
[2871.40 --> 2879.52]  finally the show is brought to you by nope not that kernel care i'm supposed to play the accompanying
[2879.52 --> 2887.74]  video while i do the read there it is kernel care plus detects all vulnerable shared libraries in memory
[2887.74 --> 2892.72]  and automatically applies live security updates without requiring service restarts or server reboots
[2892.72 --> 2898.72]  the installation process of kernel care plus is easy plus you can set it up on multiple servers at a time
[2898.72 --> 2903.68]  after the installation the software will automatically check for new patches every four hours saving you
[2903.68 --> 2908.52]  the time and trouble of manually checking and other than the initial installation of the kernel care
[2908.52 --> 2914.20]  agent you don't need to do anything else the agent can either talk with a dedicated kernel care plus
[2914.20 --> 2920.44]  patch server or an on-premises one inside your infrastructure and kernel care is available for almost
[2920.44 --> 2926.40]  for all major linux distributions learn more and try kernel care plus for seven days on all your servers
[2926.40 --> 2932.38]  at the link in the video description i think that the video is a little bit on the longer side than
[2932.38 --> 2942.98]  the speed of my read today but um hey see you later good try all right oh oh we're still hiring

[2991.14 --> 2995.60]  social media coordinators so if you want her to get the job maybe talk about it on social media
[2995.60 --> 3001.26]  yeah full-time logistics coordinator we're hiring one of those full-time bookkeeper or accountant
[3001.26 --> 3008.66]  we know that that is an extremely broad posting but the reality of it is we want someone good
[3008.66 --> 3017.62]  and whatever that looks like we uh we want it we're also looking for a junior account manager so this is
[3017.62 --> 3025.50]  like sales um we're looking for full-time video editor and camera operator how many people are we
[3025.50 --> 3029.54]  hiring right now full-time junior design and manufacturing engineer for creator warehouse

[3035.44 --> 3043.66]  here and before i actually blink again that is nuts i don't think you're counting floatplane are you so
[3043.66 --> 3050.66]  freaking nuts yes yeah but you guys aren't in office i'm talking like the people that will actually be
[3050.66 --> 3056.44]  under the roof on a daily basis that i'm we're gonna need name tags luke we're gonna need name tags
[3056.44 --> 3065.08]  like how am i supposed to remember all these people you know me yeah yeah how are you gonna put them

[3078.32 --> 3087.82]  then where are you gonna put them all like i don't know luke difficult man i uh i've grown
[3087.82 --> 3094.56]  uncomfortable with how fast the company is growing to be perfectly honest with you it's really weird
[3094.56 --> 3104.08]  for me um like i never intended for this this was not what i wanted um yeah this was not this was not
[3104.08 --> 3110.68]  what i wanted uh um what else did we oh you know what we got to pay for it somehow we're selling
[3110.68 --> 3117.04]  water bottles on amazon now there's only a limited number of them there because long story short amazon
[3117.04 --> 3123.86]  only lets you ship a limited number of uh units when you're not like an established seller already
[3123.86 --> 3132.68]  so they have no idea how rabid the lmg fan base is but if you want to order an ltt water bottle in the
[3132.68 --> 3139.50]  us or canada and you want to have prime shipping this is the way to do it uh we know that shipping
[3139.50 --> 3147.00]  is one of the things that is a source of friction for buyers on lttstore.com and wait is there a bird
[3147.00 --> 3155.42]  emoji on floatplane every time your bird goes on camera there's an explosion on floatplane really yeah

[3171.78 --> 3178.38]  the spam and floatplane chat is loving the idea of madison as a social media coordinator i mean it's
[3178.38 --> 3184.80]  such a zoomer job too like one of the first assignments is going to be okay we need a
[3184.80 --> 3193.48]  presence on tiktok figure out tiktok please because i have no idea what's going on like figure out this

[3213.42 --> 3219.88]  also they're wait no they are making money on it and they're wait they sorry what is this why are we
[3219.88 --> 3226.12]  singing again like i just i can't i can't so i need madison to come in and explain it to me
[3226.12 --> 3233.70]  and we'll or someone yeah or someone or someone so that's the that's that's what we're working on
[3233.70 --> 3241.90]  that's what we're working on uh what else is there to talk about today oh yes apple uh apparently
[3241.90 --> 3249.04]  knowingly relied on child labor for three years this was posted by business insider uh washington post
[3249.04 --> 3259.46]  and uh hold on that's stupid stupid thing and the at the information oh actually i'm not familiar
[3259.46 --> 3265.26]  with that site so in 2013 they apparently learned that suyun electronics was hiring underage workers
[3265.26 --> 3270.24]  as young as 14 when they discovered this it took them three years to fully remove suyun from their
[3270.24 --> 3276.02]  supply chain uh suyun was responsible for creating io ports for the macbook pro 10 former members of
[3276.02 --> 3280.22]  apple's supplier responsibility team said this wasn't an isolated incident and that apple had
[3280.22 --> 3285.42]  refused to cut ties with suppliers who had repeatedly violated labor laws when it would have cut into their
[3285.42 --> 3291.30]  profits or caused product delays or shortages as far as my understanding goes this is we've been talking
[3291.30 --> 3296.30]  about a few things that like might be new things for apple this show i don't think this would be a new
[3296.30 --> 3302.08]  thing for apple for instance apple also refused to cut ties with beale crystal a supplier of iphone screens
[3302.08 --> 3308.26]  despite a consistently poor workplace safety record um a bill's executive explicitly admitted that
[3308.26 --> 3312.48]  improving its safety wasn't worth it because doing so had actually led to less business from apple
[3312.48 --> 3317.10]  apple was not willing to cut beale from the supply chain because then they wouldn't have financial
[3317.10 --> 3320.00]  leverage against their remaining phone screen provider lens technology
[3320.00 --> 3325.58]  oh and according to the washington post lens technology is relying on forced labor
[3325.58 --> 3331.22]  in camps in china brilliant it appears that at least five companies in apple's supply chain are linked
[3331.22 --> 3338.90]  to force labor in the xinjiang region this is allegedly so yeah that's pretty lame
[3338.90 --> 3346.02]  um it's one thing to not know about it it's a separate thing to know about it um both are bad but
[3346.02 --> 3356.44]  there's degrees of bad um finally the last thing that i wanted to talk about today shroud apparently watches
[3356.44 --> 3363.92]  ltt videos on stream like all the time so the one that i became aware of was this video right here
[3363.92 --> 3370.52]  uploaded by game recap so none of these are actually uploaded by shroud um and it's shroud reacts to
[3370.52 --> 3377.00]  ryzen 5000 series benchmarks by linus tech tips and hardware unbox it has 180 000 views look at this one this one i'm
[3377.00 --> 3384.44]  seeing for the first time shroud reacts to rtx 30 90 8k gaming with half a million freaking views so this was a
[3384.44 --> 3396.28]  really new experience for me because i kind of got to watch an ltt video through the lens of um
[3398.04 --> 3407.24]  well like through the lens of someone else creator yeah yeah like whenever i watch an ltt video i i know
[3407.24 --> 3413.48]  the spoilers like i know what's coming i never make myself i shouldn't say never occasionally i make myself
[3413.48 --> 3420.76]  laugh with a with a joke or an on screen or my on-screen antics or whatever but watching someone
[3420.76 --> 3427.16]  actually like sit and enjoy it for the first time and like laugh at our silly little eulogy for the
[3427.16 --> 3435.32]  core i9's supremacy and gaming and like uh you know the offhand quips with anthony and like you know for
[3435.32 --> 3445.32]  me when i when i react to the graph that's on screen obviously i'm not seeing that graph for the first time
[3445.32 --> 3449.64]  you know like think about the video production process so i'm i'm always kind of like
[3449.64 --> 3454.60]  faking it like it's scripted i'm like what i can't believe amd just took the crown
[3456.52 --> 3462.52]  but that's like that's choreographed so that we have a visual that comes on screen when i when i say that
[3462.52 --> 3465.14]  And it's like, I've got like notes in there for myself.
[3465.32 --> 3471.28]  Like typically I will sit down with Anthony for anywhere from about 40 minutes to an hour
[3471.28 --> 3474.32]  and a half for something like a new CPU or new GPU launch.
[3474.34 --> 3478.00]  And we'll go through like, how do we want to, how do we want to tweak this?
[3478.08 --> 3482.80]  How do we, uh, you know, cover it well without wasting time is actually really nice feedback
[3482.80 --> 3483.48]  from shroud.
[3483.68 --> 3488.34]  He's like, yeah, I'm going to watch this video because I really like their benchmarks.
[3488.34 --> 3492.82]  I'm going to watch the Linus video because, um, you know, it's just short and sweet.
[3492.96 --> 3496.02]  It's kind of everything I need to know, but you know, always get a second opinion.
[3496.14 --> 3498.76]  It's like really good consumer advice actually.
[3498.94 --> 3502.88]  So you can watch them for gaming, but you can also watch them for just like how to be a smart
[3502.88 --> 3504.20]  consumer in the modern age.
[3504.72 --> 3511.94]  Um, and it was just, it was, it was really fun and it was actually far more engaging for
[3511.94 --> 3516.24]  me to watch the video this way than to watch it on my own.
[3516.24 --> 3519.06]  Um, I, I don't watch Twitch streams.
[3519.26 --> 3524.54]  And so this is a genre of Twitch stream that I just mostly completely ignored.
[3525.16 --> 3532.62]  Um, so anyway, let's, let's continue to watch shroud react to, let's react to shroud reacting
[3532.62 --> 3533.06]  to me.
[3533.20 --> 3534.56]  He actually doesn't do much.
[3534.58 --> 3539.62]  He's mostly just putting my video on screen and sitting there collecting Twitch ad money.
[3540.08 --> 3541.96]  Um, but Hey, whatever, you know what?
[3541.98 --> 3542.68]  I'm okay with it.
[3542.70 --> 3543.40]  I'm okay with it.
[3543.40 --> 3548.18]  Um, I messaged him, I was like, Hey, thanks for, uh, thanks for showing our video on stream.
[3548.38 --> 3549.78]  I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[3549.78 --> 3551.16]  And he's like, Oh yeah, sorry.
[3551.16 --> 3553.24]  I, I didn't check with you about showing it.
[3553.30 --> 3554.20]  I assumed we'd be chill.
[3554.26 --> 3555.20]  I'm like, Oh yeah, we're chill.
[3555.30 --> 3555.70]  We're chill.
[3555.92 --> 3556.70]  Feel free.
[3557.92 --> 3560.08]  So many people on Twitch do this.
[3560.28 --> 3560.48]  Yeah.
[3561.86 --> 3562.30]  Yeah.
[3562.46 --> 3564.60]  I just, it's just something that I hadn't thought about.
[3564.86 --> 3566.20]  It's just extremely common.
[3566.20 --> 3575.20]  Honestly, I like it because it's a way it's, it's like, it's okay.
[3575.72 --> 3581.36]  So if you look at this and go, Hey Linus, couldn't help noticing that cost you half a million views
[3581.36 --> 3584.90]  on your RTX 3090 video that costs you half a million views worth of ad revenue.
[3584.90 --> 3585.90]  Okay.
[3585.90 --> 3586.38]  Okay.
[3586.50 --> 3586.74]  Yeah.
[3586.84 --> 3591.76]  So I guess it like cuts into the profitability of our business in that sense, but this is
[3591.76 --> 3596.46]  not like college, you know, college basketball where it's like, Oh, well, you know, you should
[3596.46 --> 3597.56]  just be happy for the exposure.
[3597.56 --> 3604.00]  This is truly a type of exposure that, that broadens the appeal, not just of our channel,
[3604.20 --> 3611.78]  but of like access to making smart consumer decisions based on real numbers and providing
[3611.78 --> 3612.80]  context for it.
[3612.84 --> 3618.72]  Like it's important that people see these, these gamers that they look up for shopping properly
[3618.72 --> 3622.38]  and learning about things before they just spend money.
[3622.38 --> 3629.66]  And it has some of the same issues that like claiming that the, uh, the amount of copies
[3629.66 --> 3634.64]  of a game that were pirated is exactly the same as the amount of revenue that was lost
[3634.64 --> 3635.96]  from selling that game.
[3635.96 --> 3638.04]  Like that's not true at all.
[3638.10 --> 3638.62]  Oh, for sure.
[3638.94 --> 3643.44]  There's also likely going to be some, some double views on there.
[3643.44 --> 3650.14]  Like I have personally watched a video before and then seen that same video reacted to by a
[3650.14 --> 3653.54]  certain Twitch person show up in my feed and be like, Hmm, I wonder what they think.
[3653.70 --> 3657.98]  Usually with that one, I just skipped through it to the parts where I wonder what their opinion
[3657.98 --> 3658.78]  on something is.
[3659.16 --> 3663.30]  So I don't, I don't end up, if it's like a 16 minute video, I might watch like a minute
[3663.30 --> 3667.60]  and 30 seconds or something, but like it's, it's, that shouldn't count.
[3667.66 --> 3669.68]  I already watched the video on the main site.
[3670.14 --> 3671.98]  It's not like I'm taking a view away.
[3671.98 --> 3673.70]  I wouldn't have gone and watched it again.
[3674.04 --> 3674.88]  So yeah, I don't know.
[3674.96 --> 3677.02]  I personally think it's a good form of promotion.
[3677.02 --> 3681.16]  I'm just saying I'm not, I wasn't necessarily saying that it should be automatically okay
[3681.16 --> 3681.94]  for all creators.
[3681.94 --> 3685.74]  It is probably a good idea to check in with people first, or at the very least, if that
[3685.74 --> 3689.76]  person lets you know, like, uh, not a fan, you should probably immediately stop.
[3690.02 --> 3690.34]  But yeah.
[3690.64 --> 3690.86]  Yeah.
[3690.92 --> 3691.74]  I'm, I'm down though.
[3691.80 --> 3692.24]  I'm down.
[3692.34 --> 3693.18]  He's super cool.
[3693.26 --> 3694.66]  I've really enjoyed working with him.
[3695.10 --> 3701.58]  Uh, that's yet another casualty of 2020 is, um, not being able to work with shroud again
[3701.58 --> 3702.02]  this year.
[3702.02 --> 3707.90]  We had talked just kind of loosely about, we both expressed interest in working together
[3707.90 --> 3708.32]  again.
[3708.68 --> 3712.74]  And then, well, obviously I'm not crossing a border.
[3713.24 --> 3714.84]  Obviously he's not crossing a border.
[3715.30 --> 3717.04]  So just kind of a bummer.
[3717.72 --> 3719.18]  Uh, I think that's pretty much it.
[3719.22 --> 3721.76]  It's time for us to do some super chats.
[3722.10 --> 3724.10]  Um, only got time for a couple today.
[3724.26 --> 3725.66]  Aaron says, howdy from Texas.
[3725.98 --> 3727.52]  Uh, God bless you and your families.
[3727.68 --> 3729.18]  Y'all were the best thing about my 2020.
[3729.18 --> 3730.16]  Hey, thanks, Aaron.
[3730.34 --> 3734.06]  Also, sorry to hear that your 2020 must've absolutely blown chunks.
[3734.60 --> 3735.58]  Uh, no, I'm just kidding.
[3735.64 --> 3736.36]  We're, we're pretty okay.
[3736.52 --> 3737.14]  We're pretty okay.
[3737.66 --> 3740.22]  Uh, but Hey, thank you very, very much for the kind words.
[3740.70 --> 3745.84]  Uh, Tommy Gunn says, what'll happen to all the old Wannick servers after you, uh, set
[3745.84 --> 3746.82]  up the liquid based one?
[3747.16 --> 3754.22]  Well, I think old, old Wannick might get the drives from new, from Wannick two.
[3754.22 --> 3760.08]  So Wannick one might get the drives from Wannick two, and then we'll see what, um, we'll see
[3760.08 --> 3761.40]  if they like still don't work.
[3761.92 --> 3766.62]  Cause we thought it might be something to do with like AMD's PCI express controller.
[3766.72 --> 3769.44]  And maybe if we put the Intel drives on an Intel controller, they'll work better.
[3769.52 --> 3772.38]  But then also those drives seem to be fundamentally flawed.
[3772.50 --> 3774.34]  So we're not really sure what's going on.
[3774.34 --> 3780.32]  Um, Steven says any comment on Apple's hypocrisy with respect to child labor?
[3780.54 --> 3786.14]  No more than I would comment on Apple's hypocrisy with respect to environmental impact.
[3787.80 --> 3790.28]  Like, or just like everything else.
[3790.40 --> 3793.56]  There's also like something, something that has been very frustrating.
[3793.56 --> 3800.84]  And I, I strongly appreciate the silence brand meme, uh, that was going around for a while.
[3800.84 --> 3806.02]  And I hope it kind of comes back is like, you see, you see these, these gigantic brands
[3806.02 --> 3811.38]  and gigantic, gigantic companies getting behind like different social movements and trying
[3811.38 --> 3812.88]  to be like, yeah, we're on your side.
[3812.88 --> 3819.84]  And then simultaneously, uh, lobbying against people trying to stop them from using, uh, slave
[3819.84 --> 3824.56]  labor or child labor or various other things because they don't actually care.
[3824.56 --> 3829.60]  And it is highly profitable for them to try to convince you that they're on your side,
[3829.60 --> 3831.22]  even though it's complete crap.
[3831.22 --> 3838.24]  And even if the like, you know, low paid peon that runs the Twitter account genuinely does
[3838.24 --> 3839.26]  care about these causes.
[3839.68 --> 3840.16]  Yeah.
[3840.68 --> 3846.38]  That doesn't mean that the, you know, the billionaire running it also cares.
[3847.10 --> 3847.66]  Yeah.
[3847.74 --> 3851.48]  So yeah, the thing to remember is that brands are not singular entities.
[3851.48 --> 3853.98]  They are, they are collections of people.
[3853.98 --> 3855.98]  Sort of, yeah.
[3856.10 --> 3860.26]  Sort of motivated by, well, there are people within them that can be on your side.
[3860.42 --> 3861.08]  That's a tough thing.
[3861.40 --> 3862.62]  The brand itself is not on your side.
[3862.64 --> 3863.12]  That's true.
[3863.22 --> 3866.38]  Like it's, it's almost never the case.
[3866.38 --> 3871.32]  If, if they're, if they are genuinely on your side, which they might be, it is very likely
[3871.32 --> 3875.18]  that way so that they can align with you in order for that to be part of their marketing,
[3875.18 --> 3876.84]  which could be very legitimate.
[3876.84 --> 3882.28]  And that could be a good brand to support because if they are actively acting on your side,
[3882.28 --> 3885.92]  even if it is a form of marketing, maybe that's something that you want to support and that
[3885.92 --> 3887.54]  could help improve things overall.
[3887.54 --> 3889.08]  And that's, that's, that's good.
[3889.08 --> 3892.80]  But you do have to understand that ultimately they are going to do it because it is also
[3892.80 --> 3893.54]  better for them.
[3894.10 --> 3894.32]  Yes.
[3895.60 --> 3899.24]  Speaking of, of brands that are on your side.
[3899.34 --> 3899.64]  Okay.
[3899.72 --> 3900.84]  It could be mutually beneficial.
[3900.84 --> 3905.88]  Jordan says, Hey, I love the Northern Lights desk pad from LTT store.com and all the different
[3905.88 --> 3906.30]  sizes.
[3906.46 --> 3910.36]  I was wondering if there's any chance you can do a more subtle one, like plain black with
[3910.36 --> 3912.56]  like a white logo in the corner or something like that.
[3912.82 --> 3914.74]  I believe we are working on a stealth pad.
[3914.90 --> 3921.38]  The problem is that we have booked as much production as we possibly can at the factory
[3921.38 --> 3924.92]  for the next like two months.
[3924.92 --> 3928.36]  And, uh, it's all going to be constellations.
[3929.24 --> 3932.30]  It's all going to be Northern Lights because we can't even make enough of those.
[3933.12 --> 3934.04]  So yeah.
[3937.00 --> 3938.34]  What else we got here?
[3939.02 --> 3940.58]  People are asking for a Dell update.
[3941.24 --> 3943.56]  Uh, yes, I have heard back from the insider.
[3943.74 --> 3949.38]  They're just waiting on, um, some validation that I've asked for of their position at Dell
[3949.38 --> 3950.76]  and some of their claims.
[3950.76 --> 3954.70]  I do intend to bring the Dell insider onto the program.
[3954.92 --> 3955.18]  Yes.
[3956.80 --> 3957.20]  Cool.
[3957.48 --> 3961.20]  Uh, Michael says, Linus, do a workstation video and be nice to Dennis.
[3961.32 --> 3966.24]  I will be doing another workstation building stream soon because those video editing positions
[3966.24 --> 3966.76]  we're hiring.
[3966.94 --> 3967.96]  They're going to need stations.
[3968.04 --> 3972.08]  And I'm at the point now where I'm just not willing to issue workstations to people
[3972.08 --> 3975.74]  in the editing department that I didn't build personally, because we've had a lot of problems
[3975.74 --> 3976.76]  with other ones in the past.
[3976.76 --> 3982.06]  So I will build them all personally with my own two hands and then someone will check
[3982.06 --> 3983.58]  them over for me after to make sure I did it.
[3983.66 --> 3983.78]  Okay.
[3985.32 --> 3986.74]  Hashtag Linus.
[3987.18 --> 3987.94]  So that'll be coming.
[3988.38 --> 3988.60]  Thanks.
[3988.68 --> 3989.60]  True neighborhood watch.
[3990.26 --> 3990.84]  Uh, okay.
[3990.86 --> 3992.78]  We'll do like a couple, couple more.
[3993.40 --> 3997.20]  Uh, Greedo says loving my LTT water bottle, but still waiting on the underwear to be in
[3997.20 --> 3997.68]  stock again.
[3997.76 --> 3998.46]  Hopefully 2021.
[3999.22 --> 3999.62]  Absolutely.
[3999.62 --> 4005.52]  So speaking of, uh, deplorable, uh, factory conditions, I, I don't know about deplorable,
[4005.62 --> 4007.12]  but they were not acceptable to us.
[4007.26 --> 4011.32]  Uh, that's why we haven't had underwear in stock for quite some time, but guess what?
[4011.40 --> 4013.12]  The shipment is about to land.
[4013.20 --> 4015.94]  We are going to have underwear in a new style.
[4016.12 --> 4019.90]  We're also doing a reprint of the old style ones in case people missed out on them because
[4019.90 --> 4023.86]  they were unexpectedly discontinued when we found out what was going on.
[4024.34 --> 4026.14]  Um, yeah, I'm, I'm excited.
[4026.32 --> 4028.10]  We're going to, we're going to do another underwear shoot.
[4028.10 --> 4037.48]  So man, is the, uh, is the new style just like the print or is it like new fabrics and
[4037.48 --> 4037.64]  stuff?
[4037.64 --> 4038.94]  Oh, I'm wearing one of them right now.
[4038.98 --> 4039.24]  Hold on.
[4039.64 --> 4041.56]  So this is, uh, this is an early unit.
[4041.70 --> 4042.36]  Just a sec.
[4043.00 --> 4043.30]  Hold on.
[4043.32 --> 4045.24]  Just let me, let me get all adjusted here.
[4045.74 --> 4046.12]  Okay.
[4046.16 --> 4046.54]  Hold on.
[4046.80 --> 4047.32]  Just got it.
[4048.14 --> 4048.88]  Uh, there we go.
[4049.78 --> 4051.30]  What if this is allowed on Twitch?
[4051.62 --> 4052.36]  I have no idea.
[4052.52 --> 4052.94]  Hold on a second.
[4053.06 --> 4053.26]  I got it.
[4054.72 --> 4056.92]  Oh, I can't, I can't get up, you know?
[4056.92 --> 4057.34]  Hold on.
[4057.54 --> 4057.96]  I got it.
[4058.82 --> 4059.32]  It's got it.
[4059.44 --> 4061.78]  Uh, I mean, I'm not showing any skin.
[4062.62 --> 4063.64]  So there you go.
[4063.72 --> 4068.36]  It's like a purple kind of like cool matrixy kind of design.
[4068.48 --> 4071.06]  And the waistband doesn't have Linus tech tips on it anymore.
[4071.46 --> 4073.32]  It's just like a super subtle.
[4073.50 --> 4074.66]  Oh, I can't show it to you.
[4074.96 --> 4075.38]  There you go.
[4075.46 --> 4077.84]  It's like a super subtle rubberized LTT.
[4078.60 --> 4079.04]  Okay.
[4079.22 --> 4080.28]  Oh, there we go.
[4080.40 --> 4081.00]  Sorry about that.
[4081.00 --> 4093.74]  Can I just, can I just take a moment to, um, uh, to cry about the cruelty of one Mr. Nick Light?
[4093.74 --> 4095.24]  Oh my.
[4095.24 --> 4106.12]  Can you, can you imagine what kind of monster it would take to launch an underwear product immediately after the holidays?
[4106.12 --> 4107.12]  Okay.
[4107.12 --> 4111.62]  Requiring me to do a shoot in my underwear right after Christmas.
[4111.62 --> 4113.26]  Okay.
[4113.26 --> 4113.46]  Okay.
[4113.76 --> 4116.58]  Because that's not, that's not fair.
[4117.28 --> 4118.36]  That's not funny.
[4119.08 --> 4120.14]  That's just mean.
[4120.82 --> 4121.08]  Okay.
[4121.96 --> 4123.22]  So, yeah.
[4123.30 --> 4123.60]  A little bit.
[4123.88 --> 4124.30]  A little bit.
[4124.40 --> 4125.36]  Go f*** yourself, Nick.
[4126.04 --> 4129.14]  But are the materials and stuff the same?
[4129.28 --> 4131.28]  Like, is it just a new print?
[4131.42 --> 4133.26]  You will not be able to tell the difference.
[4133.96 --> 4134.20]  Okay.
[4134.44 --> 4134.62]  Yeah.
[4134.66 --> 4137.90]  We almost screwed up the sizing, even though the material was really good.
[4137.90 --> 4145.16]  But it is, I think we made them ever so slightly either longer or shorter based on some really good feedback that we got.
[4145.36 --> 4150.58]  But in terms of the quality and the type of the material, it is basically identical.
[4151.08 --> 4151.54]  Awesome.
[4151.70 --> 4151.86]  Cool.
[4152.12 --> 4152.52]  That's exciting.
[4152.94 --> 4157.16]  It took us a long time because that was what was good about the factory we were using.
[4157.52 --> 4159.64]  The quality of the product was really good.
[4160.00 --> 4163.02]  Too bad it was just unacceptable to use them.
[4163.02 --> 4170.94]  So we had to find someone that could produce just as good a product, but not under crappy conditions.
[4172.64 --> 4173.44]  All right.
[4173.64 --> 4176.98]  I think that's pretty much it for the WAN show today.
[4177.20 --> 4179.96]  Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
[4179.96 --> 4182.22]  We will see you again next week.
[4182.66 --> 4183.62]  Same bad time.
[4183.74 --> 4184.44]  Same bad time.
[4184.50 --> 4184.94]  Excuse me.
[4185.06 --> 4185.70]  Same bad channel.
[4185.80 --> 4186.56]  We were super late today.
[4186.66 --> 4187.44]  It's a very bad time.
[4189.08 --> 4189.44]  Bye.
[4190.00 --> 4190.66]  Oh, Nick.
[4190.78 --> 4191.02]  Nick.
[4191.14 --> 4191.48]  Hold on.
[4191.52 --> 4192.16]  Nick just messaged.
[4192.24 --> 4193.72]  He says, and I quote,
[4194.62 --> 4195.24]  F*** you.
[4196.66 --> 4196.96]  Lol.
[4200.62 --> 4201.02]  Yeah.
[4201.06 --> 4201.92]  Right back at you, bud.
[4202.00 --> 4202.76]  Right back at you.
[4202.80 --> 4203.26]  And you know what?
[4203.30 --> 4203.60]  You know what?
[4203.62 --> 4205.52]  Because I'm the one who's live, I get the last word.
[4205.88 --> 4206.64]  F*** you twice.
[4207.06 --> 4207.58]  That's right.
[4207.80 --> 4208.22]  All right.
[4208.42 --> 4209.70]  Show's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[4210.60 --> 4214.58]  Oh, for those who don't know, Nick is, Nick is, Nick manages Creator Warehouse, our merch
[4214.58 --> 4214.86]  business.
[4215.44 --> 4215.82]  Sorry.
[4215.98 --> 4218.00]  If you needed some context for that.
[4218.32 --> 4218.70]  All right.
[4218.80 --> 4219.46]  Roll that outro.
[4219.46 --> 4219.64]  All right.
[4219.64 --> 4219.66]  Roll that outro.
[4219.66 --> 4229.94]  Can I just say how much I love my bleep button?
[4231.52 --> 4233.30]  Because it's so much fun.
[4234.12 --> 4236.66]  It makes me so happy every time I use it.
[4238.30 --> 4239.02]  Oh, man.
[4242.48 --> 4244.00]  And, and...
