[2021-07-01T07:00:17Z] Video: I want to talk to you about Windows 11 - WAN Show Jun 25, 2021 
I have yet to listen through all 90+ minutes of yapping, but is there absolutely ZERO focus on the fact that CPUs older than 8th Generation are not "allowed" to run Windows 11? I have a perfectly fine PC built in 2017, with 32 GB of RAM, more NVME and SSDs than you can shake a stick at, but with with an i7-7700K I will not be able to install Windows 11. What is this doing for the environment? Congratulations: more e-waste. Do we really have to upgrade CPU and motherboard at least every 3 years because the previous config can't POSSIBLY be "safe"? Somebody point out a timestamp in this video where they address CPUs, because all I've heard so far is endless yapping about rounded corners and aesthetics. I guess people who buy Porsches don't consider PC ugrades expensive...
