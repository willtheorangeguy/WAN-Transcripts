• Criticism of WD's handling of the issue, including their failure to properly label the change and introduce a new model number
• Western Digital does not specify recording technology in their NAS documentation, which can lead to confusion.
• Western Digital did not break a promise by not labelling their products accurately, but it still erodes customer trust when they don't follow through on expectations.
• Samsung also made a similar move by allegedly downgrading the 970 EVE Plus due to silicon shortages and changing controller packaging, impacting performance.
• Crucial may have swapped TLC NAND for slower chips in their P2 SSDs, which was not caught initially but may be a sign of intentional design choices rather than quality issues.
• Sab rent is notable because it's one of the few companies that are vertically integrated, meaning they manufacture their own components, and hasn't been embroiled in similar controversies.

• OnlyFans reverses decision to ban adult content, now says it will provide a home for all creators
• Discussion on alternate payment processing platforms that can handle adult content, but are expensive and have poor user experience
• Payment processors like Amazon Payments, Google Payments, Apple Payments, and Stripe/PayPal are dominant in the industry
• The speaker reflects on a platform (likely OnlyFans) and notes that creators should diversify their platforms due to potential changes.
• The platform's decision not to pursue an alternative was likely due to the majority of users being driven to it by non-safe for work content.
• The speaker believes that the platform misinterpreted momentum in safe for work content as a change in identity, when it was actually just a break from adult content.
• TSMC will be raising their prices by up to 20% for certain wafer sizes due to increased demand and raw material costs.
• This price increase could affect companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and Intel, which rely on TSMC's fabrication services.
• GPU prices are expected to increase due to rising material costs, with a possible 2-3% increase per 1% material cost rise
• The current shortage situation is being used by NVIDIA to raise prices and skip some of the usual steps in product development
• It's unlikely that top-tier GPUs will return to their pre-pandemic price points (e.g. $699, $749)
• Apple has settled a class-action lawsuit related to its App Store policies, with terms including:
  • Developers can communicate directly with customers about alternative payment options
  • A $100 million small developer fund for smaller developers (note: actual amount is closer to $70 million)
  • Establishment of a transparency report on app rejections and customer/developer account issues
• The speaker discusses their frustration with Apple's app revisions and compliance issues, which they feel have been unnecessary.
• A class action lawsuit against Apple has resulted in a settlement of $100 million, with the lawyers taking 30% for their work.
• The speaker criticizes the practice of lawyers taking large portions of settlements, leaving little to affected individuals.
• The small developer assistance fund is mentioned as a positive outcome of the settlement, but its effectiveness is questioned.
• The speaker hopes that Apple's loss in this case will help set a precedent for future lawsuits, such as the Epic case.
• Various anecdotes and stories from others are shared about their experiences with class action suits.
