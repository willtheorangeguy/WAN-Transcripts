[0.00 → 9.00] you know what they say in the CPU business when it's on
[9.00 → 19.08] they say it's on that's right ladies and gentlemen when you're failing hire people
[19.08 → 24.92] that you used to have employees yeah yeah intel has made some very interesting hiring decisions
[24.92 → 31.30] as of late that look like they're going to heat up competition in the CPU market in other news today
[31.30 → 39.36] we've got uh oh man this is not going to be a very interesting show today but Google has threatened
[39.36 → 46.68] to pull out of Australia over a new link tax that's right they will not be putting any dingo in
[46.68 → 54.90] Australia's baby oh my goodness also NVIDIA is sort of killing the max q and max p brand
[54.90 → 61.16] ending thank goodness also uh no it's not good news that that's not good news we'll talk about
[61.16 → 68.06] that no it's terrible oh Geez it's actually way worse it's worse than ever before oh boy that's
[68.06 → 75.56] exciting also Raspberry Pi foundation launches a four dollar pi PICO four dollars imagine that a
[75.56 → 79.88] four dollar computer well you know what are you wasting your time imagining that for I know i
[79.88 → 83.50] told you to imagine it, but you got to have a mind of your own you got to think about if you're supposed
[83.50 → 88.42] to imagine it or not you don't have to imagine it because it's real just like the intro is real
[88.42 → 89.44] yeah
[89.44 → 98.30] what is reality though reality it's the real digital really be real it's the real Kitty
[98.30 → 113.02] not the fake Kitty yeah stupid fake ditties that's right uh oh uh but uh oh i never actually
[113.02 → 121.84] set up the sponsors today dang it I knew that i I knew I didn't do things I just like man am I even
[121.84 → 128.28] competent the show is brought to you today by fresh books kernel care and pulse way oh yeah I'm not even
[128.28 → 135.94] all right we're going to jump right into our big topic today the original sources are onondtech.com
[135.94 → 142.46] and investors business daily despite intense competition from arm-based competitors and
[142.46 → 148.96] rival chipmaker AMD intel has beaten its q4 2020 targets with record revenue I mean there's one good
[148.96 → 155.18] thing about putting the bean counters in charge am I right record revenue another way of looking at
[155.18 → 158.74] this is the like there 's's some there are certain companies that benefit from pandemics
[158.74 → 162.40] well that's another way of thinking about it but yet another way of thinking about it
[162.40 → 167.68] is that there are certain companies that are experts when it comes to milking 14 nanometers
[167.68 → 175.62] squeezing blood from a stone that's what intel is the master of so intel beat its q4 2020 targets and
[175.62 → 181.38] the star of the show was the client computing group which is your core i's your core i's
[181.38 → 189.42] which benefited from increased demand um that the pandemic has placed on computer sales as Luke
[189.42 → 195.40] might have mentioned before there's a bit of a catch though these numbers were leaked forcing intel
[195.40 → 201.46] to release its earnings report early intel blamed the leak on a hack which caused their stock to drop by
[201.46 → 207.58] four percent to as much as nine percent erasing a seven percent increase from yesterday but then hold
[207.58 → 213.56] on a second why did the stock go up yesterday and this is where the headline of today's when show
[213.56 → 220.48] comes from very exciting intel made a very interesting recent hire so they've got a new CEO with
[220.48 → 228.00] thankfully an engineering background uh, so this is pat gel singer and instead of an accounting background
[228.00 → 239.06] which is just wonderful and apparently at the request of CEO pat gel singer uh Glenn Hinton has come back
[239.06 → 246.54] to intel, so this is not like a new hire in the sense that you go to the store and buy new shoes
[246.54 → 253.84] this is a new hire in the sense that you have old shoes that you've worn for 35 years
[253.84 → 261.46] and you like really like them, but they were retired and then now you're wearing them again
[261.46 → 267.16] yeah yeah so like it's shoes in the closet that you've refused to get rid of and then one day you're
[267.16 → 271.62] like you know what I'm going to crack them back out you know what i just all the other shoes every other
[271.62 → 278.58] shoe in the market those Yeezy they ain't got nothing on my like 35-year-old hiking boots you know
[278.58 → 286.26] like this is the work this is the workhorse shoe so Glenn Hinton worked on a couple of projects that
[286.26 → 295.42] you've probably never heard of before um there was the Pentium pro okay uh the Pentium 2 Pentium 3
[295.42 → 302.62] um I mean i barely even heard of them and like I've been into computers my whole life but what's
[302.62 → 310.20] Pentium what's even Pentium is it like penthouse is it like sexy computers you know yeah um yeah
[310.20 → 318.54] worked on the i960 ca the first super scaler risk processor um uh napalm you ever heard of napalm Luke
[318.54 → 327.54] I mean uh I isn't that like an uh, uh isn't that a doom guy level what's that what's that napalm I think
[327.54 → 336.48] it's uh I think it's a small area of oregon USA I think it's an is that a county it's a city
[336.48 → 343.26] wow that really barely qualifies as a city I mean are you kidding me right now sports camp number
[343.26 → 350.58] eight there's like a few streets like bigger than napalm Oregon no offense if you're from
[350.58 → 355.44] napalm just kidding I know nobody from napalm is actually watching because there's like apparently
[355.44 → 364.22] six people the population was 271 people in 2010, and they probably don't have internet anyway so i
[364.22 → 371.52] think I think we're good here on not upsetting the people of napalm too badly either way the point is
[371.52 → 378.48] uh okay well a lot of you might not have actually heard of napalm but napalm was the code name for
[378.48 → 385.70] what was pretty much like the beginning of the modern high-end desktop core series processor so
[385.70 → 393.88] that was on LGA 1366 that was um let's let me have a let me have a look here uh I think Bloomfield was
[393.88 → 403.48] technically a sub Bloomfield hold on a second yeah Bloomfield okay Ctrl f napalm yeah yeah
[403.48 → 408.84] yeah okay uh so Bloomfield is just like the socket specific code name for high-end desktop
[408.84 → 415.68] and then Salem was the same micro architecture that was used for Bloomfield infield and clarified so
[415.68 → 421.02] infield and clarified were LG 1156 so that was the consumer platform sorry this has been a long
[421.02 → 428.76] time guys you have to forgive me here and then the Salem was like the big man like the Salem was like man
[428.76 → 435.26] you have to flush that thing like three or four times it had triple channel memory which is like
[435.26 → 442.20] a big deal at the time it had up to six cores on the extreme edition actually you know what
[442.20 → 448.40] hold on I think it was gulf town that actually uh gulf town don't quote me on that gulf town intel
[448.40 → 453.66] no that was west mere I'm sorry I'm sorry we had to wait until but whatever the point was
[453.66 → 462.86] the Salem set the stage for a totally different level of desktop uh computer performance and uh
[462.86 → 470.88] Mr Glenn Hinton might have worked on that he owns more than 90 patents from eight CPU designs over
[470.88 → 477.14] his career, and he's retired on social media Hinton says he will be leaving retirement to work on
[477.14 → 484.72] an exciting high performance CPU project saying quote if it wasn't a fun project I wouldn't have come
[484.72 → 488.60] back as you know retirement is pretty darn nice
[488.60 → 500.78] so I'm excited because here's the thing I mean okay I feel like I remember seeing people in the community
[500.78 → 506.40] talking about when um oh shoot sorry
[506.40 → 513.50] uh talking about yeah yes okay I remember seeing people in the community talking about when Jim Keller
[513.50 → 519.34] went back to AMD it's like I don't know maybe Jim Keller's best ideas are behind him or something
[519.34 → 526.80] like that um turns out they sure as heck weren't uh just because Jim Keller was you know over at apple
[526.80 → 533.64] tesla for a little bit doesn't mean that he forgot how to make a CPU and the thing about super smart
[533.64 → 538.92] people because remember guys we're not talking about like you know the kid in your high school
[538.92 → 546.30] that got the best grade on the math test or whatever we're talking about super smart people here
[546.30 → 554.02] is I'm willing to bet that in the 10 years since the Salem and in the 10 years 15 years since k8
[554.02 → 559.42] uh so Jim Keller actually had about a similar period of time I'm willing to bet that super
[559.42 → 564.48] smart people have sat around and thought of some pretty super smart ideas that they just couldn't
[564.48 → 569.40] execute before or hadn't thought of um and I wonder what would have happened if we took this angle or
[569.40 → 573.86] this other angle etc yeah because the thing about anything is that there's always a way to improve
[573.86 → 580.42] even something as simple as like a t-shirt ltdstore.com there's always ways to improve it so here's
[580.42 → 588.16] something that here's something we didn't realize until we actually hired a fit fitment engineer i
[588.16 → 593.54] think that's what the position is called anyway she works here now, and we were like okay so we're
[593.54 → 599.34] working on our own t-shirt blanks instead of just buying American Apparel shirts and printing on them
[599.34 → 605.26] and she was like yeah so one of the things that I realized about American Apparel's blanks
[605.26 → 613.58] is that the neck hole is identical for small medium and large and there's a process called
[613.58 → 619.72] grading for um for shirts I would think they would just call it sizing because that's what it is that's
[619.72 → 625.76] where you that's where you take a design, and then you grade it, or you like size it up and size it down
[625.76 → 630.70] and she's like yeah that's like not how you would typically do that because someone who wears a large
[630.70 → 635.20] t-shirt probably has a bigger neck than somebody who wears a small t-shirt it's just like it's
[635.20 → 640.98] laziness basically and I was like wow I didn't even know that and that's why we have professionals
[640.98 → 647.08] who do this stuff so even something as seemingly simple as a t-shirt there's like infinite ways that
[647.08 → 651.90] you can continue to refine and continue to perfect it now let's talk about you know a whole other
[651.90 → 659.24] several orders of magnitude more complicated project like I don't know a computer processor
[659.24 → 664.28] I'm sure they could come up with some would have could have should as from last time around and I am
[664.28 → 676.16] I am extremely excited now on tech's dr IAN sutras from tech potato um suspects that it will
[676.16 → 681.48] be three to five years before this project bears any kind of fruit and also suspects and this is kind
[681.48 → 687.72] of obvious thanks, thanks IAN uh also suspects that this is not like a financially motivated move because
[687.72 → 693.96] intel's clearly making plenty of money but what it seems like to me is that intel has finally pulled
[693.96 → 699.86] their heads out of their collective butts realized that if they actually sit there and actually do
[699.86 → 705.34] nothing eventually someone will actually show up and compete with them and that instead of just
[705.34 → 710.92] focusing on financials and balancing the balance sheet which is a good thing you can't even call it a
[710.92 → 715.26] balance sheet if it's not balanced definitely that's stupid I think I want to interject for one quick
[715.26 → 721.56] second I sometimes think no, no only I talk on when so no um I sometimes think when we talk about the
[721.56 → 727.36] like an engineer should be leading this company type of thing yes some people think that we like don't
[727.36 → 732.16] think that finance or business or marketing or whatever people should be like involved at all
[732.16 → 738.86] no it's just we don't think those type of people should like to lead the ship should pilot the
[738.86 → 742.34] ship like they still need to be there or else everything will crash and burn because you won't
[742.34 → 748.32] have any freaking money which is extremely important so just maybe not leading the ship that's all
[748.32 → 755.10] the reason that okay so we got uh Jr Damon over on twitch says you say that, but they are massively
[755.10 → 761.96] increasing dividends instead of and spending you know what you don't necessarily need the biggest
[761.96 → 765.80] and budget if you have really smart people working on really cool projects that they're
[765.80 → 770.74] really passionate about so I am not necessarily also don't think increasing dividends is the right
[770.74 → 775.04] move right now that's probably not the right move right now but also another quick thing they
[775.04 → 780.60] just hired the guy what what what and spending are they supposed to do right now this second
[780.60 → 787.44] clearly the project is like not you know done um so give it a little bit of time give it a
[787.44 → 791.66] little bit of time anyway the point when it comes to leadership you need multiple
[791.66 → 796.62] perspectives that's something that is so important I remember I was reading an article about how
[796.62 → 803.32] amazing Tim Cook's leadership is because he forwarded an email internally only adding the word
[803.32 → 809.60] thoughts question mark to like key members of the leadership team and like how amazing and like
[809.60 → 815.14] visionary that style of leadership was and I was like what are you talking about that's the most obvious
[815.14 → 823.30] thing ever pretty much every decision we make at Linus media group is handled about like that and
[823.30 → 828.42] sometimes as CEO I will say thank you for your thoughts we're actually going to do it this way but
[828.42 → 833.54] unless you have multiple people giving input you can't possibly hope to make the right decision every
[833.54 → 844.50] time and if you do think that you're basically an arrogant moron like that that's all there is to it, I'm and I'm not afraid to say that and I'm just like what we need
[844.50 → 850.66] because anyway the point is to be clear I'm not saying that was a bad way to send an email I'm saying
[850.66 → 855.70] you know great job you got to respect the members of your team because if you don't, they can't do a good job for you
[855.70 → 862.90] I'm just saying that I don't think that's that amazing I mean one of the reasons that leg has worked so well from the beginning
[862.90 → 870.82] is you've got me with like the raw dragon energy you know it's like what you know why can't we do that
[870.82 → 878.38] you know i I want to do that it doesn't it kind of nothing else matters we're just going to do it like I remember having a conversation with my uncle where he goes
[878.38 → 889.62] you know what's your what's your business plan uh what are your projections what's your forecast and I'm like forecast what we have literally no revenue what would I forecast I'd just be pulling numbers out of my butt
[889.62 → 897.54] if I'm going to pull things out of my butt it should probably be videos so that I can upload them so maybe I'll have some revenue, and we'll talk about a forecast like
[897.54 → 904.98] yeah we'll talk about forecast later it'll be fine it'll be fine and uh you know we would we know we would hire
[904.98 → 919.54] we would hire someone or like I'd want to hire someone and Yvonne will be like okay well here are the numbers and I'll be like no, no no take your numbers throw them in a fire I've got this like gut feeling you know that if we that is we bring in this person
[919.54 → 947.94] it'll like it'll pay for itself in this roundabout way and I don't have numbers to back it up but don't worry about it and the thing is like you need both of those perspectives because Yvonne has also pulled me back from the edge of making very poor financial decisions multiple times, and you need people who are grounded in reality to actually execute on a crazy vision like if I had the idea you know oh I have an idea why don't we have an amazing studio
[947.94 → 977.92] okay good job Linus good idea you know I'm sure every YouTuber every twitch personality ever was you know like oh man i got a dope idea what if I had what if I had a studio, and it was like full of lights, and we had cameras and there we could have people to move the lights and operate the cameras it'd be amazing oh my god what if we had a company, but that's just an idea somebody has to actually find it
[977.92 → 990.54] make it fit in the budget and uh and then actually pay for it, you know make sure the company's cash flow make sure that the paychecks you know cash I mean Luke do the paychecks always clear
[990.54 → 996.12] I think so eight years in you literally don't even check do you know you have direct deposit
[996.12 → 1002.38] I trust him on dude I don't know when's the last time you checked your paycheck hey Vaughn I think we could
[1002.38 → 1007.94] probably stop paying Luke i I think he absolutely wouldn't notice she's like don't tempt me no she didn't
[1007.94 → 1016.70] say that yeah I think I did it like the beginning for really not that long I think and then eventually I was
[1016.70 → 1022.96] just like it's going to be like I remember one time even when I was checking I like didn't notice that
[1022.96 → 1027.24] there was some discrepancy and Ivan caught it and like told me about it and fixed it and I was like
[1027.24 → 1033.76] wow yeah I really don't need to check I think it's going to be fine you know Ivan doesn't do payroll anymore
[1033.76 → 1045.90] right yeah anyway um so I'm excited um I mean yeah obviously it's going to take a long time for
[1045.90 → 1054.46] this to have any impact on something you can actually buy but like how freaking refreshing is
[1054.46 → 1059.28] it and Anthony has a note in here can I just say that it's refreshing that the minds behind these
[1059.28 → 1065.06] chips are getting recognition rather than just intel did it uh AMD had Jim Keller fork ate and zen
[1065.06 → 1069.68] intel even had Keller as senior VP, but he quit in June over whether to outsource more production
[1069.68 → 1074.70] I actually hadn't heard yet that that was why he quit I did not know that wow that's uh
[1074.70 → 1085.12] oh man intel come on I'm like to be clear I'm not rooting for intel because I think they have like
[1085.12 → 1091.10] you know amazing business practices and a history of putting the consumer first every time
[1091.10 → 1098.20] that is absolutely not what's happening here I am always rooting for more competition in the CPU space
[1098.20 → 1104.30] and whether you like it or not when it comes to performance intel is the underdog right now
[1104.30 → 1111.98] and that's great, but you don't want it to last forever don't imagine for a second that AMD is
[1111.98 → 1118.88] going to behave any differently part of it is just it's just human nature it's human nature it's the
[1118.88 → 1124.40] capitalist system that we all are participating in whether we like it or not it just is what it is
[1124.40 → 1130.08] if they sit there for long enough with no competitive challengers they will get complacent
[1130.08 → 1135.76] we already are seeing it with dozen 5000 they already increased prices did they have to
[1135.76 → 1142.32] probably not did they do it anyway sure I mean that's the free market baby supply and demand it's
[1142.32 → 1146.28] not like they can make enough of them anyway so they might as well increase the price right
[1146.28 → 1152.14] and you know from for AMD like if I'm just looking at it as like an enthusiast I'm like you know what
[1152.14 → 1159.98] AMD go for it, you could probably use the money so you can go buy like an interconnectivity vendor
[1159.98 → 1166.92] who they buy alter or something I can't remember what company they bought AMD buys uh xylene is that
[1166.92 → 1173.12] the one why did I say alter yeah yeah yeah um you know go go go buy some stuff make sure you stay
[1173.12 → 1177.88] competitive because I need that competition to be ongoing, but that doesn't mean that I want intel to go
[1177.88 → 1184.16] 10 years without you know releasing products that are like you know bulldozer grade that that was that
[1184.16 → 1189.28] was a rough time when there was only one CPU vendor because you got to remember competition's good for
[1189.28 → 1194.72] not just me personally as an enthusiast it's good for my business like if I can have AMD and intel
[1194.72 → 1200.40] bidding against each other for like who wants to market their CPUs the hardest because you know the
[1200.40 → 1206.60] competition the performance is close so it all comes down to marketing hey I win just saying you know
[1206.60 → 1211.60] that's that's why that's why I say I remember I forget when it was I did a video about this a while
[1211.60 → 1217.62] back, but that's why I always say guys you have to look at whoever's talking to you, you have to look at
[1217.62 → 1223.58] whatever motivation they have for me, I'm pretty transparent I am highly motivated by succeeding in
[1223.58 → 1230.22] my business and by being a computer nerd you can pretty much explain most of my actions
[1230.22 → 1239.16] by those two things and the bottom line is you know for my business i I cannot screw with you guys
[1239.16 → 1245.52] because my business doesn't exist without you and as a computer nerd I can't screw with you guys because
[1245.52 → 1250.48] I've been I've been helping people pick the right parts for their computers since before anybody even
[1250.48 → 1257.32] gave me a paycheck for it so but that doesn't mean that I'm not all about my business growing and making
[1257.32 → 1263.64] money and continuing to uh offer career development opportunities for the people who have hitched their
[1263.64 → 1271.80] carts to hitch their carts to my horse so i am all about it being absolutely cutthroat in the
[1271.80 → 1279.16] computer industry I love it I want the most I want the most brutal competition possible because it's good
[1279.16 → 1284.84] for me in every possible way everything that motivates me I win if there's intense competition
[1284.84 → 1293.92] and so do you by the way do you think this is the first major move and I know they have made many
[1293.92 → 1299.14] moves so I'm using major quite specifically do you think this is the first actual major move that
[1299.14 → 1308.14] they've made to combat AMD no what I suspect is that because I mean I've already seen other things I mean
[1308.14 → 1316.72] those cry coolers maybe they're a clumsier uh a clumsier effort to combat AMD, but they're really
[1316.72 → 1324.56] cool do you know the details of them does he major though no, no no okay what's major about that is that
[1324.56 → 1331.68] that project is crazy it makes no sense so kind of like counterculture to what they've been doing for
[1331.68 → 1336.16] a long time yes okay yeah no I agree with that that makes sense yes yeah I'm on board so it's like
[1336.16 → 1342.70] I haven't it's not the fire, but it smells like smoke you know what you know what I mean there's a there's
[1342.70 → 1350.76] a fire under intel's butt and I can smell the intel butt smoke fire smoke um and those kinds of projects
[1350.76 → 1357.40] those kinds of like yeah we took some smart people, and we locked them in a room, and we said go make some
[1357.40 → 1363.18] crazy stuff, and they came back, and they were like here's our crazy stuff, and we were like green light
[1363.18 → 1369.02] let's go that is an attitude shift that we needed to see from them and that I believe is actually
[1369.02 → 1375.52] happening they have lost some key talent no doubt, but the thing about key talent is that it attracts
[1375.52 → 1383.06] key talent you know okay think about it this way we have people on our team at Linus media group
[1383.06 → 1391.16] that members of our community admire if we didn't have people like you know an Alex or Anthony or
[1391.16 → 1398.70] Jake or Riley or jams like if we didn't have this team that is already perceived as like superstars
[1398.70 → 1405.54] then the quality of our applicants whenever we put out a job posting I guarantee you is lower because we
[1405.54 → 1409.38] have people talk about how exciting it would be to work shoulder to shoulder with these guys
[1409.38 → 1417.20] so it's its an it's a snowball effect the more you can bring on talented team members the more other
[1417.20 → 1422.94] like smart talented team members the more other smart talented people are going to be like gee there
[1422.94 → 1428.86] must be something to this you know what I had so much of your life working you should probably want
[1428.86 → 1434.44] to you, you would probably aspire to try to be an environment that would inspire and drive you forward
[1434.44 → 1437.68] etc, etc so that's that's going to be the type of stuff that you're going to try to push for
[1437.68 → 1444.46] exactly, exactly that's why a brain drain is something that is not easy to stop it's not
[1444.46 → 1452.54] something you can just throw more money at it's its not that simple um so I'm I'm really excited
[1452.54 → 1458.34] I'm hoping for a big comeback here because I want to see competition for all the various reasons that i
[1458.34 → 1465.92] love it and I think it's time to move on to our next topic google has threatened to pull out of
[1465.92 → 1470.80] Australia over the new link tax laws Luke do you want to run us through this one I've been talking
[1470.80 → 1476.34] a lot I'm sorry all right uh big tech firms have been facing increased calls for regulations as
[1476.34 → 1483.04] profits soar and Australia is looking to be the first to step up to the plate we've been talking
[1483.04 → 1488.76] about this type of stuff for a long time now, but it's been kind of hit or miss and how it's going to
[1488.76 → 1494.02] be implemented and I think one of the big reasons for that is because of the massive variance in terms of
[1494.02 → 1498.36] companies that operate on the internet there's your google's there's your Facebook's but
[1498.36 → 1503.82] then there's also your you know your float planes and your other stuff there can only be one float
[1503.82 → 1510.58] plane yes Australia's link tax law would make google Facebook and other companies pay media outlets
[1510.58 → 1517.44] for linking to their news content very interesting google and others in the industry have said the law
[1517.44 → 1523.44] would be unworkable and leave them with no other choice but to leave the country Australian lawmakers
[1523.44 → 1530.68] respond by accusing google of blackmail with pm I didn't actually see that coming with uh prime
[1530.68 → 1538.60] minister Scott Morrison saying they would not yield to threats wow interesting I guess leaving the
[1538.60 → 1545.60] country is a threat I mean kinda is uh is Pia a sponsor of this stream uh I don't know does it
[1545.60 → 1551.54] matter well they are now you can if this becomes a thing and google pulls out you could use Pia and still
[1551.54 → 1557.20] use Google yeah um Australian newspaper revenues have been dropping steadily since the late 2000s that
[1557.20 → 1561.46] you could probably I would assume put any country at the beginning of that sentence, and it would
[1561.46 → 1567.72] probably be true Australia sees financial support for its news industry as vital to democracy
[1567.72 → 1576.40] if the law passes probably in a lot of ways yeahs because the the the more news outlets go under
[1576.40 → 1584.24] the more it's going to simmer down to fewer sources of information if that makes sense yep um you're
[1584.24 → 1589.32] going to have less less potential views on a topic which is not good you want more reviewers uh whether
[1589.32 → 1597.62] it's news articles or more perspectives is healthy yeah yes according to lawmakers news accounts for an
[1597.62 → 1605.14] eighth of Google searches in Australia while Australia isn't google's the largest market by a pretty massive
[1605.14 → 1610.24] amount I would say google is fearful for what precedent this might set and that's that's pretty
[1610.24 → 1615.22] legit um because I'm sure other countries are going to look at how effective this ends up being or doesn't
[1615.22 → 1622.26] end up being yeah especially places like the EU which are very um pretty regulation happy pretty
[1622.26 → 1628.42] regulation happy and pretty on the forefront of digital regulation I would say yeah which a lot of
[1628.42 → 1634.86] countries are still not necessarily stepping in on uh last week google piloted a program blocking news
[1634.86 → 1640.74] sites from search results for one percent of Australians to test the value of Australian news
[1640.74 → 1648.86] services ouch dang what a way to put it that's google and Facebook argue that news organizations get the
[1648.86 → 1655.00] benefit of their platforms driving readers to their websites they report that the comparative revenue is
[1655.00 → 1662.30] tiny google says just 7.7 million out of 3.7 billion total in Australia over 2019
[1662.30 → 1671.62] jeez jams has a take on this he says this will only lead to information silting where Facebook will
[1671.62 → 1677.70] introduce a search engine to search for news uploaded to Facebook evading the tax similar to how people
[1677.70 → 1685.16] search on Amazon instead of shopping the web more broadly uh yeah yikes that actually makes sense
[1685.16 → 1691.44] uh this is pretty funny this is jams's take I actually don't necessarily agree with it a hundred percent
[1691.44 → 1697.42] he says also just you news media do you know what it's like to post something and get zero traffic
[1697.42 → 1700.12] it sucks consider yourself lucky
[1700.12 → 1706.34] okay so I think he's still a little salty about getting banned on Twitter
[1706.34 → 1713.98] do you know about this do you hear about this i I heard about it, I didn't know the details behind
[1713.98 → 1718.98] it but I did hear about it okay so jams checked his twitter page one day and was like wait what
[1718.98 → 1724.68] jams tweeted at Colton because they were kind of sniping back and forth on Twitter about something
[1724.68 → 1733.98] he was just like I'll kill you and twitter flagged it as like a death threat and suspended his account
[1733.98 → 1742.12] and he has since reached out to twitter and been like hey that guy is my friend and colleague I'm not
[1742.12 → 1750.10] I wasn't actually threatening to kill him um obviously this was flagged by a bot can can we can
[1750.10 → 1758.06] we please fix this uh I won't do that again but yeah can we please fix this no response get this
[1758.06 → 1765.02] jams follows up and is like hey I sent in a ticket about this can we please have a human review it
[1765.02 → 1768.46] because as soon as a human looks at it, I think it'll be pretty clear that this is like
[1768.46 → 1776.58] my bud and I was just messing around with them um someone got back to him and was like hey we
[1776.58 → 1782.94] haven't reviewed your original ticket yet like an actual human replied to his follow-up ticket just
[1782.94 → 1791.38] to tell him that no one had replied to his original ticket it's like right since you're looking at it
[1791.38 → 1799.30] why don't you just look at it and then just fix it so that I don't have to send another ticket
[1799.30 → 1806.86] uh, uh because it's like it's non-trivial right like I think he's got like 30 40 000 followers so
[1806.86 → 1811.88] it's not like it's just simple to whatever I'll just create a new handle or whatever
[1811.88 → 1817.40] and send the handle to all my friends yeah exactly it's like he's an actual public figure
[1817.40 → 1823.36] so you'd think you guys would care a little bit and since you're looking at it since you're looking
[1823.36 → 1831.08] at it anyway why not just fix it immediately it's like it's kind of like picking up something on the
[1831.08 → 1836.68] dining room table and moving it to the counter you're just going to have to pick it up and put it
[1836.68 → 1842.40] in the dishwasher again why don't you just put it in the dishwasher my wife said to me because i
[1842.40 → 1847.28] definitely she's making a face i definitely do that and that doesn't change the
[1847.28 → 1853.36] fact that I do it doesn't change that it's stupid it is stupid but I just mean I'm not being paid
[1853.36 → 1859.64] to put dishes in the dishwasher okay twitter's customer support person is presumably being paid
[1859.64 → 1866.50] and you know you could argue that I do receive you know benefits from helping out around the house and
[1866.50 → 1872.04] you know being a good husband you know you could say that see she's nodding she's nodding
[1872.04 → 1876.76] she's like yeah yeah totally you get benefits for that and I'm like yeah see that's the kind of
[1876.76 → 1883.24] that's the kind of exchange you know we have it's like the man makes the money and the woman
[1883.24 → 1889.96] has her wow you wouldn't, I've seen how far I could push this you wouldn't believe the looks I'm
[1889.96 → 1892.04] getting right now love you honey
[1892.04 → 1902.22] oh man I'm just I'm just going to go on a story of your earlier uh dating yeah yeah yeah when
[1902.22 → 1907.16] when she was the one who made literally all the money and I was the college dropout that was living
[1907.16 → 1919.00] at her parents house yeah oh boy and uh today's wan show is brought to you by oh wait are we wrapped
[1919.00 → 1925.00] up with that uh topic uh more or less yeah more or less okay so a lot of its speculative we'll see
[1925.00 → 1929.88] if it actually happens and if it does happen we'll see if google actually pulls out and if google
[1929.88 → 1933.16] actually pulls out we'll see how well that goes how pregnant Australia ends up being
[1933.16 → 1940.04] yeah will google play child support I don't know I suspect not the show is brought to you today by
[1940.68 → 1947.56] kernel care enterprise provides you with more integration support and control over your
[1947.56 → 1952.44] server it's a live patching tool that integrates with automation tools and vulnerability scanners
[1952.44 → 1958.68] supports the latest patches lets you decide what patches are rolled out across your organization and
[1958.68 → 1965.64] even runs inside the firewall it works in your local infrastructure via e-portal a dedicated patch
[1965.64 → 1971.96] server that runs internally but outside your firewall this acts as a bridge between internal
[1971.96 → 1977.00] patch servers and the main kernel care patch server this approach is ideal for staging and production
[1977.00 → 1982.12] environments that need strict isolation from external networks or require more stringent control over
[1982.12 → 1988.28] the patches to be applied it's available for all major Linux distributions and guess what you can try out
[1988.28 → 1995.16] kernel care enterprise for free at the link in the video description my read was a little bit I love this
[1995.16 → 2002.92] like super, super tux thing they got going up in there all right let's go ahead and oh hey look at that
[2002.92 → 2012.12] it's done I'm removed that, and the show is also brought to you by FreshBooks oh yeah

[2121.72 → 2129.64] lttsstore.com it's not actually, but we do actually we do have some big news guess what Luke guess what
[2130.52 → 2135.24] what we brought a sexy back baby
[2135.24 → 2144.52] we finally have underwear in stock again our new supplier our new supplier has come through and
[2144.52 → 2151.00] delivered underwear they're stealthier than ever before got just like a kind of black rubber LTT on
[2151.00 → 2157.08] the waistband uh we've got a few new designs so like a more constellation inspired one a more like
[2157.08 → 2163.96] kind of looks kind of like matrix lines of binary kind of thing going on and then a completely stealth all
[2163.96 → 2171.56] black are included in the new pack and this is on top of our crew neck sweater being back in stock
[2171.56 → 2177.32] and then I think there was something else I was supposed to tell you guys about now hold on just a
[2177.32 → 2181.88] minute here I don't know I don't know how twitch's terms of service are right now but i I'm currently
[2181.88 → 2188.84] wearing those more constellation-y looking ones oh yeah yeah how do you like the new ones good I like them
[2188.84 → 2195.16] yeah yeah i like the uh I don't know how to describe it the kind of like tactile logos along
[2195.16 → 2201.40] the band because I feel like if it's like they have this type of feature in dress pants where it
[2201.40 → 2208.12] will like to hold on to your clothes better oh there it is sorry, sorry I was looking for a thing and I think
[2208.12 → 2216.12] I just found it no worries uh whoa hey oh what's this oh my what's this you got there what's that is that
[2216.12 → 2225.24] an is that a special edition hollow foil shirt you have to be kidding me it is its wait where pretty
[2225.24 → 2231.72] sick uh the GPU shirt oh I guess the stream is probably okay stream's probably a little probably a
[2231.72 → 2236.76] little delayed so guys now's a pretty good time to go check out lttstore.com get some underwear get a
[2236.76 → 2244.52] shirt it's all it's going to be all good in the hood speaking of all good NVIDIA is well there's something
[2244.52 → 2250.84] earlier this week NVIDIA began changing some of the messaging around max q we've actually got a full
[2250.84 → 2257.24] video coming about this so I'm not going to get into all the detail because um there are certain
[2258.12 → 2266.60] time related restrictions that affect how much information I can give you know what actually
[2266.60 → 2272.04] this is really easy I'm going to sit here and I'm just going to smile and Luke is going to read this one
[2272.04 → 2282.36] because I am under NDA nice I like Luke doesn't know anything I mean okay that's harsh um Luke knows
[2282.36 → 2288.04] lots of things he doesn't know anything about this he just knows what he's reading from
[2288.04 → 2294.20] SEF digital on the forum and pc gamer okay go ahead digital and pc gamer earlier this week NVIDIA began
[2294.20 → 2299.64] changing some of the messaging around max q planning to drop the GPU differentiating moniker
[2299.64 → 2309.72] for the upcoming RTX 30 GPUs for laptops they said that max q has grown beyond only GPU optimizations
[2309.72 → 2315.64] oh wow so impressive this led to speculation that NVIDIA was killing the max q branding
[2317.00 → 2322.84] um but an NVIDIA rep told pc gamer that the max q branding is not going away
[2322.84 → 2331.72] okay, okay and NVIDIA statement reads when we originally introduced max q back in 2017
[2332.60 → 2341.24] the brand was initially used in GPU naming since max q referred to the GPU TGP only today third
[2341.24 → 2347.56] generation max q is broader and is a holistic set of platform technologies and design approach
[2347.56 → 2355.96] to building powerful and thin laptops what the heck does that even mean what does a holistic set of
[2355.96 → 2361.16] platform technologies and design approach to building powerful and thin laptops mean
[2363.08 → 2370.04] holistic set of platform technologies so for those of you not following some of the lingo here TGP is
[2370.04 → 2377.00] total graphics power so that's how much of the total power budget of the laptop is allocated to the
[2377.00 → 2382.36] graphics card, but then it's a little more complicated than that which the full video will touch on um
[2383.24 → 2393.48] and it's also yeah it's like what your cooling system would have to be able to handle uh okay so
[2393.48 → 2397.96] go ahead Luke all right yeah I'm not supposed to say anything shut up and video is putting the onus on
[2397.96 → 2404.44] OEMS to properly advertise their laptops features moving forward okay this means that it's going to be up
[2404.44 → 2412.28] to end users to do the research to compare between options OEMS may choose to adhere to NVIDIA's max q
[2412.28 → 2422.84] guidelines or not, so the brand isn't technically dead it may just be dying slowly max q and max p were
[2422.84 → 2428.68] perfectly good ways to distinguish the capabilities of laptop GPUs this muddles the water for people
[2428.68 → 2438.84] comparing laptops as one 360 like one RTX 360 can be a completely different spec than the next 360.
[2438.84 → 2445.08] interestingly max p isn't actually an official term coined by NVIDIA the community just started using
[2445.08 → 2450.92] the name for NVIDIA's full power mobile GPUs now the first time I heard it was not from the community
[2450.92 → 2457.48] I actually heard it first from laptop makers so i I think it's more it might originate more there but
[2457.48 → 2463.96] it's hard to say exactly where it came from its just that you know max q originally designed
[2463.96 → 2475.16] was more than just like a GPU with a lower TDP um or TGP excuse me um max q was like a requirement it
[2475.16 → 2481.96] had to be no louder than a certain amount no thicker than a certain amount, and it had to offer performance
[2481.96 → 2490.28] over a certain amount so yes the max q product was the GPU like the binned GPU that went in there to
[2490.28 → 2498.12] make that possible but max q was like a bigger like it has an official blog post on nvidia.com max p even
[2498.12 → 2505.16] though I have heard NVIDIA staff use the term because it's so stupid they don't have a term for it because
[2505.16 → 2512.52] like how are you supposed to call it just like RTX 30 RTX 30 max q well what is RTX 30 is it the
[2512.52 → 2516.28] desktop one is it the mobile one we don't know because they're just both called the same thing
[2516.28 → 2520.36] like come on who do you think you are apple just calling everything the same thing, and they've had
[2520.36 → 2525.56] so many differences over the last few years in terms of like yeah how they're treating mobile GPUs and how
[2525.56 → 2532.04] how equivalent mobile GPUs are to desktop GPUs and exactly better differentiation was would be good
[2532.04 → 2537.16] the reason why I was excited about this at first was because I knew max p was kind of a muddy term
[2537.16 → 2543.64] yeah and I was like oh maybe they're like moving on and like using something more properly defined but
[2543.64 → 2550.36] no it seems like they're moving on and using something less properly defined and I will say this
[2550.36 → 2559.96] much it gets much worse don't miss the video oh boy it gets way more complicated I'm not saying you
[2559.96 → 2566.76] know you know whether RTX 30 is good or a bad product it has nothing to do with that at all I'm
[2566.76 → 2572.92] just saying if it's complicated it's going to be complicated well I don't have any more information so
[2572.92 → 2578.44] I think you guys will just have to tune in again later on that more specific video in other news the
[2578.44 → 2585.48] Raspberry Pi foundation launches a four dollar pi PICO four dollars how do you make a computer for four
[2585.48 → 2592.36] dollars so epic I don't even understand it no you can't even you can't even get like the socket of
[2592.36 → 2602.84] an epic motherboard for four dollars so the pi PICO is the first in-house designed microcontroller from
[2602.84 → 2608.44] the Raspberry Pi foundation typically hobbyists will pair the Raspberry Pi with microcontrollers for
[2608.44 → 2614.76] real world applications due to the pi not being great at low latency Io interfacing like all raspberry's
[2614.76 → 2621.00] devices the PICO has extensive documentation aimed at both experienced power users and new tinkerers
[2621.00 → 2628.84] and features an in-house designed rp2040 processor built on a 40 nanometre process it's got dual arm
[2628.84 → 2637.48] cortex m0 pluses clocked at 133 megahertz 264 kilobytes of embedded memory with support for up to 16 legs of
[2637.48 → 2644.52] off-chip flash memory an USB 1.1 controller okay so it's not cutting edge more nerd specs are listed on
[2644.52 → 2652.60] the blog post actually I'm very curious I'm headed for the nerd specs look at this thing holy smokes it
[2652.60 → 2660.92] is tiny whoops daisies sorry about that guys uh it is flipping tiny a little bit to actually get to
[2660.92 → 2668.68] the pi PICO look at it it's its a tiny it's a tiny boy it's like there's a little like display like a little
[2668.68 → 2676.92] project display right next to it that is sick okay so here's some of these here are some of these nerdy speeds
[2676.92 → 2681.16] and feeds 30 GPO pins four of which can be used as analog inputs that's pretty sweet
[2681.16 → 2685.16] sweet computer controller 16 PWM channel
[2688.04 → 2695.08] USB mass storage boom oh okay cool so you can yep that makes sense cool a lot of people seem very
[2695.08 → 2699.96] interested in the analog inputs which is yeah that's a big deal something I would point out with something
[2699.96 → 2705.72] like this is like yeah a lot of the modern computing that we do especially in like the ram department i
[2705.72 → 2711.56] would say has kind of ballooned a lot and like what you're going to do on a computer or a laptop
[2711.56 → 2718.60] or a phone etc is going to be very heavy but the things that you can use computers like this for like
[2718.60 → 2724.68] you read out those specs, and you're like oh that sucks, but it still has USB functionality at all
[2724.68 → 2732.04] which is actually extremely useful if you're doing more specialized smaller tasks like doing basic
[2732.04 → 2737.88] things hasn't necessarily gotten more difficult especially if you're like developing specifically for it or if
[2737.88 → 2743.88] it's something very specific that you're going to have it always you want an auto watered for your like plants
[2745.08 → 2751.16] it doesn't need more you don't need a Leon you know yeah it's okay you're good you're good
[2751.80 → 2759.16] so like 133 megahertz and an USB 1.1 controller and 264 kilobits of uh embedded memory
[2759.16 → 2764.36] is probably completely fine for like there you go you heard it here first you heard it this is the
[2764.36 → 2771.88] next famous quote to what was it 256 kilobits well it ought to be enough for anyone Luke lafferniere 2021
[2771.88 → 2777.48] there's a ton of projects that you can accomplish with that much, and you don't necessarily need more
[2777.48 → 2785.08] and I think the art of accomplishing as much as you can with what you have has kind of died a
[2785.08 → 2790.60] little bit like I remember watching just say min maxing Luke you know you want to yeah the min
[2790.60 → 2794.92] maxing your hardware has died a little bit I know like watching gaming documentaries from a long time
[2794.92 → 2803.64] ago watching game developers talk about like min maxing the position of data on a disc yeah oh yeah for
[2803.64 → 2812.28] sure so that the head is more likely to be closer to you know that part of the uh of the actual disc itself
[2812.28 → 2818.36] so that the next day that it needs is like right in line like that stuff is crazy, and it was
[2818.36 → 2824.36] actually something that people did and like you had to really fight a lot to fit within these crazy
[2824.36 → 2831.24] confines and yes that is still a thing um consoles are an I'm not trying to drag on consoles but consoles
[2831.24 → 2836.52] are a more measured metric like you know more what you're dealing with um, but we don't really see that
[2836.52 → 2842.60] many crisis style games come out any more it's I think it's much less common for a game to come out
[2842.60 → 2846.76] and everyone that wants that game to go rush out and do massive computer upgrades so they can actually
[2846.76 → 2854.44] play it like i I genuinely know people that are running processors that are like nine to ten
[2854.44 → 2863.08] generations old that are still running new modern titles just fine now to be crazy to be clear it's like
[2863.08 → 2868.92] more of uh it's more of a microcontroller than like an actual computer like you wouldn't go you
[2868.92 → 2875.00] wouldn't go load up Raspbian on this even like that's no but what I'm saying is you can still
[2875.00 → 2882.04] accomplish a lot with it absolutely, and it's cool that I don't know I like the idea of working with
[2882.04 → 2888.20] those confines and being able to accomplish great things anyway it seems like the entire YouTube chat has
[2888.20 → 2894.44] no idea what a live stream is its kind of amazing twitch chat and float plane are both just like yes we
[2894.44 → 2901.24] understand what's going on entire YouTube chat is like disliked due to clickbait we talked about that
[2901.24 → 2912.52] topic an hour ago it's a live stream it was literally the first thing we talked about Lord it's its not the
[2912.52 → 2919.96] entire video it's the wan show it's in the title oh man after all these years I mean how long have we
[2919.96 → 2927.16] been doing how long have we been doing the wan show Luke like seven years or something yeah somewhere
[2927.16 → 2939.64] around there, and you come on people help me out leg's at eight years now yeah Geez it's crazy it's crazy
[2939.64 → 2945.88] uh speaking of leg being at eight years uh we still have job listings up for our full-time bookkeeper
[2945.88 → 2951.64] slash accountant whatever we end up with full-time video editor slash camera op uh float plane has a
[2951.64 → 2957.96] full-time developer and web design contractor position up on linusmediagroup.com uh just because we get a
[2957.96 → 2963.96] little bit more traffic there um do you want to talk about the developer position just a little bit since we've got
[2963.96 → 2969.48] all these people watching yeah the developer position is somewhat generalized you will probably
[2969.48 → 2974.92] end up working on a wide variety of things as we are a small team and that just kind of happens when you are
[2974.92 → 2983.00] among a small team, but you will likely be focused your main job will be developing implementing
[2983.00 → 2995.48] researching etc features uh or implementing currently existing uh, uh features from tools available on the Shopify store for lttstore.com
[2995.48 → 3002.92] we are specifically looking uh for someone to dedicate to that so experience working with Shopify experience
[3002.92 → 3009.56] working with e-commerce platforms experience working with JavaScript etc is all uh very sought after
[3009.56 → 3015.80] for that position so if you are interested in that feel please feel free to go to the form
[3015.80 → 3023.24] enter your information and apply, and the designer position is for just like the websites that we kind of
[3023.24 → 3030.28] overlook in general so flowplane.com lttstore.com potentially other jobs um it's not a full-time
[3030.28 → 3037.96] position it would be jobbed by job uh so it is remote um we are able to hire from kind of wherever's for
[3037.96 → 3045.56] that because it is very job by job specific um Canadian would be a plus, but it is remote um and
[3045.56 → 3051.56] yeah that's yeah that's about it sweet uh got a couple more job postings here as well we need a
[3051.56 → 3056.92] full-time junior design slash manufacturing engineer and a full-time retail product and inventory manager
[3056.92 → 3061.72] apply at linusmediogroup.com I think we've got at least one more topic to talk through here
[3062.36 → 3069.32] this is pretty sweet uh video cards did an article on the Vic on YT is that what this channel is actually
[3069.32 → 3083.56] called oh Lord this is okay that is Russian AF I absolutely love it um at least I hope that's I hope
[3083.56 → 3090.68] that's Russian it could be it could be another sort of whatever those types of languages are
[3090.68 → 3095.24] called with the Cyrillic yeah Cyrillic characters I don't I don't I don't know anyway the point is
[3096.20 → 3103.64] the YouTuber successfully modified a RTX 2070 to have 16 gigs of VRAM instead of the standard 8.
[3104.44 → 3110.92] after accessing leaked NVIDIA PCB diagrams for the 2080 skew he replaced the old micron models with
[3110.92 → 3119.96] Samsung mod uh modules and then changed the resistors into a different binary code for the ram CFG jumpers
[3119.96 → 3127.64] the modified card works and actually registers successfully as 16 gigs VRAM however there was a
[3127.64 → 3134.68] significant performance lost at least at loss at least in 3dmark time spy, so the average 2070 score is
[3134.68 → 3143.88] 9100 points and his 16 gig card got 6100 points so it's a little it's a little significant there and
[3143.88 → 3150.12] it's unstable and quickly fails in firm arc, but similar modifications can apparently be made to a
[3150.12 → 3157.72] few other NVIDIA GPUs to double the standard VRAM the 1050 and 1050 ti can go from 2 to 4 gigs the 1060
[3157.72 → 3163.32] can go from 3 to 6 gigs, and it should be noted this does not work with the 1070 1080 or 1080 ti
[3164.12 → 3168.68] if you want to modify your own 2070 because you like voided warranties and worse performance and
[3168.68 → 3175.88] instability Samsung's 16 gig gddr6 modules can be found on AliExpress for roughly 200 us dollars that
[3175.88 → 3185.16] is to say 16 gigs worth of Samsung gddr6 modules uh I think that card has eight chips so it would be
[3185.16 → 3191.72] two gigabytes per module don't don't quote me on that I can't remember off the top of my head um
[3191.72 → 3204.28] fascinating uh twitter accused of profiting from child pornography jams posted this I wonder if he
[3204.28 → 3209.80] has a bone to pick with twitter no I'm just I'm just uh a minor boy and his mother are suing twitter
[3209.80 → 3213.96] alleging that it benefited from and neglected to remove an exploitative video featuring him and
[3213.96 → 3219.56] another minor which was retweeted thousands of times and has at least 167 000 views on the platform
[3219.56 → 3223.48] the lawsuit claims that the minor and mother repeatedly contacted twitter about the content
[3223.48 → 3227.88] but Twitter allegedly didn't suspend accounts distributing it until a federal agent from the
[3227.88 → 3233.32] department of homeland security intervened good that they uh good that they banned jams though
[3233.32 → 3237.80] yeah according to the filing one or multiple traffickers tricked the boy into providing
[3237.80 → 3242.36] explicit images to a Snapchat account he was led to believe belonged to a 16-year-old girl
[3242.36 → 3246.44] after obtaining the explicit content the traffickers allegedly blackmailed the boy
[3246.44 → 3253.00] into providing the video that ultimately spread on Twitter a twitter spokesperson told Fox News
[3253.00 → 3257.32] twitter has a zero tolerance policy for any materials that feature or promote child sexual
[3257.32 → 3262.44] exploitation we aggressively fight online child sex abuse and have heavily invested in technology
[3262.44 → 3269.16] and tools to enforce our policy okay apparently not enough filing also details communication between
[3269.16 → 3275.64] John Doe his mother and twitter one email shows twitter telling this is the boy that on January
[3275.64 → 3280.36] 28th that it reviewed the content and didn't find any violation of our policies, so no action will be
[3280.36 → 3284.44] taken at this time what do you mean you don't see a problem the minor asks in response that same
[3284.44 → 3288.92] day we are both minors right now, and we're minors at the time these videos were taken we both were 13
[3288.92 → 3293.96] years of age wow what did the video
[3296.36 → 3304.44] what was it I mean I'm not going to go watch it yeah I don't know you either but like if is they're saying it
[3304.44 → 3315.40] didn't I don't know yeah I mean this is the kind of thing that's like uh if I don't want to see it yeah
[3315.40 → 3323.48] I definitely don't want it in my internet history if it actually is 13-year olds you know doing explicit stuff
[3323.48 → 3334.68] on video um so there you go good luck uh John Doe boy and mother in your um in your campaign here
[3334.68 → 3341.56] because if that went down the way that you say it went down that is super a plus not okay for twitter
[3341.56 → 3346.92] the safer way to deal with a situation like this would just be to at the very least temporarily pull
[3346.92 → 3353.64] it down while you evaluate you I'm sure that I'm sure that could lead to bad situations where people
[3353.64 → 3358.44] are like using your automated tools to censor things and whatnot but I feel like that would be a
[3359.24 → 3363.16] a better result maybe I don't know well the problem is that once twitter pulls something
[3363.16 → 3366.84] they evidently don't have any way to restore it like jams's account
[3366.84 → 3378.52] oh Geez all right side note thing yeah people are saying that the uh the link for the designer
[3378.52 → 3384.28] job doesn't work uh this happened with another one of the job postings as well I don't know why if you
[3384.28 → 3390.76] click on it doesn't work but if you copy and paste it, it does um I think there's something weird going on with
[3390.76 → 3399.88] the uh the Squarespace link thingy, so yeah just copy and paste it for now I think there's some way
[3399.88 → 3403.80] that Colton was able to fix the previous one so I've I've messaged him, and he'll, I'm sure he'll
[3403.80 → 3409.88] look into this one shoot I just emailed him well it's too late sweet uh we've got some super chats
[3409.88 → 3414.76] it's not too late for those that's uh freaking awesome uh I don't know why people send them but
[3414.76 → 3420.68] they do a cache says kirk or Picard I need to know Luke help me out here kirk or Picard
[3420.68 → 3425.80] card Skywalker we both did it
[3428.52 → 3433.56] I want a real answer Luke don't even give me that I won't take it I take no ray
[3434.52 → 3444.04] have you watched much I mean i watched I've probably seen a solid 120th of the episodes
[3444.04 → 3449.24] of each series so I've seen like probably well okay no I've probably seen more than that because I think
[3449.24 → 3455.32] there actually weren't that many episodes of the original Star Trek I was a kid though so I haven't
[3455.32 → 3461.96] watched it since then I do definitely like to know enough about the show just because I have my eyes
[3461.96 → 3469.96] open and my ears not buried in sand so like I get the jokes you know like the red shirts and uh, uh you
[3469.96 → 3476.28] know the many emotions of Spock you know poster where he's just like and I know that that's actually
[3476.84 → 3482.60] not Spock because he does have emotions it's this whole part of his whole characters he has this like
[3483.16 → 3488.76] this mix of like logic and emotion his human and Vulcan sides blah blah blah like I know like kind of
[3488.76 → 3495.32] enough to get by but I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie by any stretch of the imagination i definitely
[3495.32 → 3503.40] watched more like by numbers more episodes of the next generation um I remember thinking when I was
[3503.40 → 3511.00] a kid that uh, uh dr crusher was probably called dr crusher because you were supposed to you know think
[3511.00 → 3521.08] she was pretty sweet um I actually wonder if maybe my tastes were very strange as a kid I don't even know
[3521.08 → 3526.92] what she looks like anymore the amount that I have seen I would probably say Picard you'd say Picard
[3527.48 → 3536.76] I think so okay well there's your answer ladies and gentlemen but I have seen very, very little and
[3536.76 → 3542.44] have never pursued it at all because there's so many Star Wars content to consume and I like it a lot
[3542.44 → 3550.12] so I just do that do you still like it is keeps beating you, and you keep coming back to it, I just keep
[3550.12 → 3558.84] going back to older stuff what older stuff expanded universe oh just like books yeah yeah
[3558.84 → 3563.40] yeah that's fair enough all right yeah there was a time when Star Wars was good uh Robert mail says
[3563.40 → 3568.28] took a bit, but the whole house has good Wi-Fi on the other hand choosing a bidet like jams suggested
[3568.28 → 3572.12] has been a bit of an experience never thought falsifying my toilet would be one of the toughest
[3572.12 → 3579.40] decisions and expensive too okay uh DAL Sims says Luke what changes have you made to float plane live
[3579.40 → 3586.28] streaming in Australia is working amazing now it used to stutter heaps when well I don't know do i
[3587.00 → 3592.92] yeah all right um there's been lots of changes made there's been lots of changes made to live
[3592.92 → 3596.68] streaming there's been lots of changes made to everything else um it just depends on what your
[3596.68 → 3603.24] what your timeline is uh Alex and Simba says Luke please convince Linus to do a haptic gaming vest video
[3603.24 → 3608.44] part two there are lots more products now in the market okay do you even use your VR setup i have to
[3608.44 → 3617.16] know i I do sometimes are you even an enthusiast anymore Luke my area is very bad um in order to
[3618.12 → 3625.64] properly use my setup I would have to move a very large amount of furniture and even than
[3625.64 → 3631.80] it wouldn't be great and at the previous place I was at if I put my hands over my head I would punch
[3631.80 → 3639.72] the ceiling that is no longer a problem here I can't move I can't go in any direction which is
[3639.72 → 3644.84] just like a different are we ready to tell people where you lived at your previous place yet like is
[3644.84 → 3651.80] it far enough removed that we can be like yeah yeah I mean I don't think there's anything all right
[3651.80 → 3656.52] where did you live previously Luke I used to live below the office
[3660.20 → 3664.28] some people knew that um there was a few community members that knew that
[3664.28 → 3670.76] and for literally years and I will always appreciate this and owe them for this um
[3672.28 → 3678.36] just ran like there was a small group of them that all had this constant conversation going on
[3678.36 → 3684.68] on to help deflect and push people away from the idea that I did live there yeah because they
[3684.68 → 3690.28] all knew that, but they used that information to like drive this thing that I didn't um he told
[3690.28 → 3695.40] yeah I lived below the office it was fantastic my commute was walking up the stairs and sometimes
[3695.40 → 3705.00] he didn't make it yeah um it was fascinating whenever I'd be sick because I'd be like laying in bed
[3705.00 → 3713.64] listening to Linus record videos upstairs uh we had lots of problems with dishes people would actually
[3713.64 → 3721.88] go down into Luke's basement suite take his dishes use them leave them in the upstairs sink and then like
[3721.88 → 3727.32] just not acknowledge that they did it like there's a reason there's a channel super fun video about like
[3727.32 → 3733.40] finding the dishes thief or whatever but like there's so much more that went on behind the scenes that you
[3733.40 → 3738.92] guys don't know about that led up to that being something that was like such a big issue we made
[3738.92 → 3744.52] a video about it and like it's that much of an inside joke it's such a weird problem too because like i
[3745.24 → 3751.40] would not have minded at all if people use my stuff but like to go down into my space and just take my
[3751.40 → 3760.20] things and then leave them dirty what are you doing I don't know I don't understand and there were so
[3760.20 → 3766.28] few people at the company at the time that it's like who do you think you're fooling it's like three
[3766.28 → 3772.68] or four people yeah I know it wasn't me I'm pretty sure it wasn't him because if it was him it would just
[3772.68 → 3780.28] be at his desk he wouldn't bother to dump it in the sink yeah or like downstairs in the actual sink
[3780.28 → 3786.68] yeah in his sink we had two sinks obviously um and then one of the other funny ones for me is that
[3786.68 → 3794.52] like Luke's house you know right was the only place once we grew a little bit more it was the only place
[3794.52 → 3799.64] in the building that we had like sort of a private meeting room so the first year that we did like
[3799.64 → 3808.84] annual employee reviews I was like so Luke um can we do this in your like living room, and he's like
[3808.84 → 3813.16] I guess sure yeah I mean it's your house I guess uh yeah
[3815.72 → 3825.56] so I'm sitting so I'm sitting in Luke's living room under my office in my house giving Luke his like
[3825.56 → 3831.56] annual employee performance review which we've never done before because it seemed like you know
[3831.56 → 3835.56] like such a formal thing, and we'd always just been like kind of like broking out and making videos about
[3835.56 → 3840.12] tech up till that point I'm just like I think I probably opened it up with like this is the most
[3840.12 → 3850.04] awkward thing that I've ever had to do yeah that was a that was an interesting time oh man um all right
[3850.04 → 3856.04] what else we got it was pretty useful too though because like there would be certain things like i
[3856.04 → 3863.00] remember we wanted to do an ambient sound test of something yeah so that was like way easier because
[3863.00 → 3869.96] I just waited until everyone was gone and then just like wind set up the test and then went downstairs
[3870.68 → 3875.32] and just like did whatever yeah, and it didn't matter that like oh I need to go check it in like half an
[3875.32 → 3880.92] hour or something because like it takes me seconds to go upstairs like it's really not a big deal yeah
[3880.92 → 3885.80] it was kind of helpful he was our built-in security guard too because I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure Luke
[3885.80 → 3891.96] would have bashed in the skull of someone who tried to take like my CPUs probably I'm glad it
[3891.96 → 3897.88] never happened because like Canada's got some pretty messed up laws around like defending your own
[3897.88 → 3909.08] property it's pretty stupid yeah, yeah pretty dumb yeah um okay what else we got going on here blah blah blah
[3909.08 → 3914.52] blah blah blah oh this is when Luke was full freeloader oh yeah it was real cheap
[3918.84 → 3926.36] well there it was a symbiotic relationship right because like giving him a benefit in terms of
[3926.36 → 3932.28] rent makes his life more affordable which makes it so that he doesn't just like need more salary like
[3932.28 → 3936.44] if I was like Luke you can't live here he's going to be like well to maintain the same standard of living
[3936.44 → 3941.80] that I enjoy you should probably pay me x amount more like he's that kind of person trust me and
[3944.04 → 3949.08] and aside from that the benefit to me of having him there at the office is that whenever I can't
[3949.08 → 3953.24] get in touch with him, I know where he lives no, no I'm just kidding uh the benefit to me is like
[3953.24 → 3959.72] actually having him on site was really, really useful I slept better at night knowing that like Luke
[3959.72 → 3966.52] was there I mean he's a pretty deep sleeper actually so if someone did break in its very
[3966.52 → 3972.12] likely that he wouldn't have noticed but if he did notice having him there I would definitely notice
[3972.12 → 3975.08] that oh yeah that's true if the alarm went off you would have you would have noticed that but having
[3975.08 → 3980.12] Luke there was actually a huge benefit for the company and absolutely worth like the discount on rent
[3980.12 → 3986.36] and he did pay rent it's not like it was just a total freeloader situation he did not pay enough for it
[3986.36 → 3996.44] yeah so that was part of that was part of what helped Luke save up for that down payment
[3996.44 → 4005.08] I'm pretty sure cheap for him yeah um kine stick over on uh in the super chat says uh wow okay you
[4005.08 → 4009.00] don't need to send oh okay it's Australian dollars I was like wow you don't need to send like 50 bucks
[4009.00 → 4015.16] but it's like not real dollars um as an Aussie most people are actually on Google's side these laws are
[4015.16 → 4020.36] entirely driven by Murdoch media who owns about 70 of all Australian media uh there's a good seven
[4020.36 → 4025.16] minute uh video on the opening shots of this fight and sent a link but I'm not going to click it because
[4025.16 → 4029.80] I'm on like my own stream right now uh, but apparently it's seven minutes so you should be able to
[4030.84 → 4038.20] find it I think that is pretty much it for the wan show today I want to thank you guys for tuning in we

[4068.12 → 4074.28] it's pretty sweet it's very shiny by the way some people in the whole plane chat are putting together
[4074.28 → 4084.04] um certain events now that make more sense oh there that makes sense what are you guys talking about
[4084.84 → 4092.20] one of them was they figured out the uh the office like theft prank thing they're like oh that makes
[4092.20 → 4095.72] way more sense now because like they're like why would he have been there the day before
[4097.56 → 4105.64] because we like robbed my house because he lived there yeah yeah exactly, exactly uh nick van Burke at
[4105.64 → 4113.00] the time went to go like chase the thief or whatever, and he like ran downstairs I like went to
[4113.00 → 4115.96] go follow him because I'm like I'm probably going to have to open this door

[4129.08 → 4134.52] dell update uh I don't I don't have one I haven't heard back yet so it might be that this person was
[4134.52 → 4139.96] not able to put together the materials proving that they actually can prove what they said they can prove
[4139.96 → 4154.92] so all right that's it outro time
