[0.72 --> 8.62]  And we're live! Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen. We've actually got a freaking ton of topics to get through today, so no preamble.
[8.72 --> 14.34]  We accidentally broke Intel's embargo for their 12th Gen chips. We will talk about that.
[14.60 --> 19.14]  And of course, a summary of the media coverage of the 12th Gen.
[19.14 --> 31.08]  I will also be addressing some of the particularly ill-informed comments that were left on our video, criticizing our choices for how we decided to test the platform.
[31.70 --> 36.38]  I tried Dungeons & Dragons for the first time today, so that was fun. We're going to talk about that.
[36.46 --> 39.96]  That's sort of a little bit not really that on topic, but what else we got?
[40.04 --> 43.36]  You're going into too many shoutouts, man. You did three. You took one of mine.
[43.36 --> 50.90]  I did two. Two. Two. The Intel 12th Gen thing, including our flub and the Dungeons & Dragons thing.
[50.94 --> 51.62]  Oh, I thought you did something.
[52.60 --> 60.36]  Also, Switch modder Gary Bowser pleads guilty, owes Nintendo $4.5 million.
[62.16 --> 66.74]  Big yikes. Also, we're going to talk about Linux stuff. We do that every week on this show now.
[66.86 --> 69.04]  Yeah, we don't actually ever release the videos.
[69.04 --> 69.36]  No.
[69.36 --> 74.28]  We just talk about the videos that we are producing in the background.
[74.70 --> 81.82]  They take a long time to edit because, I don't know about Luke, but my screen capture is a complete cluster.
[81.92 --> 92.76]  Mine's not, actually. You know, for the first video, I actually numbered them for chronological order and titled each one of them so that they would know what was happening.
[92.98 --> 94.74]  So it would be easier for them to fit it into the thing.
[95.02 --> 96.62]  Yeah, mine's a little less organized than that.
[96.62 --> 96.92]  Yeah.
[97.00 --> 97.42]  Let's roll back.
[99.36 --> 129.34]  Let's roll back.
[129.34 --> 136.10]  That happened with our video review of Intel's 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs.
[137.14 --> 137.70]  Yeah.
[139.08 --> 142.26]  That's what I was going to be like, oh, no.
[142.54 --> 143.72]  You know, like, exactly.
[144.00 --> 153.58]  So what happened was the video was supposed to go live at 6 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Thursday.
[153.58 --> 162.90]  And typically what we do is we upload our video and we set it to unlisted and then we set a scheduled publication time.
[162.90 --> 169.36]  Now, we also typically promote our new video releases on Twitter.
[169.36 --> 170.36]  And because this was at 6 a.m.
[170.36 --> 182.50]  And because this was at 6 a.m., we scheduled a tweet that was supposed to go out at 6 a.m. at the same time that the video would flip live pointing to the video.
[182.50 --> 190.12]  Unfortunately, the tool that we've been using to schedule our tweets.
[190.12 --> 192.86]  And I'm not going to name any names because who knows?
[192.96 --> 194.82]  There could have been some kind of user error involved.
[194.94 --> 199.16]  Maybe we entered our time zone wrong or something like that.
[199.20 --> 203.58]  Like maybe someone went in and made a change to the account and something got screwed up and it was our own fault.
[203.66 --> 204.42]  I don't know.
[204.42 --> 205.86]  I actually do not know the details.
[205.86 --> 213.52]  But what I know is that later on that day, another scheduled tweet that we were going to send out went out many hours early.
[214.16 --> 219.68]  So somehow our scheduled tweets were going out way early.
[220.04 --> 230.40]  So I'm actually I'm glad that it wasn't any worse than it was because the tweet went out early while the video was unlisted.
[230.40 --> 233.66]  So it was viewable by people that had the link and the link was in the tweet.
[233.66 --> 234.06]  Yes.
[234.96 --> 241.36]  And then Ed spotted it almost immediately, set the video to private, pulled the tweet.
[241.36 --> 256.46]  But that didn't prevent eagle eyed viewers from ripping the video, capturing screenshots of all the graphs and then reposting them, which is very unfortunate.
[257.10 --> 262.56]  So basically what happened was our tweet scheduler bunged up, which could have been our fault.
[262.56 --> 265.96]  And we tweeted a link to an unlisted video.
[266.08 --> 269.86]  So there's a couple of different solutions that we've got to make sure this doesn't happen again.
[270.40 --> 274.28]  Honestly, the people that I think are most affected by this are our fellow members of the media.
[274.28 --> 276.32]  That was really not something that we intended to do.
[276.40 --> 277.72]  We weren't trying to get the drop on anyone.
[277.72 --> 288.74]  So what we're going to be doing moving forward is we are going to set embargoed videos to private rather than unlisted when we want to schedule them to go live.
[288.82 --> 291.82]  If possible, I actually haven't looked into whether it still works that way.
[291.82 --> 297.74]  But what we will definitely not do is schedule tweets for embargo lift.
[297.74 --> 303.64]  So we will just have to get up at 6 a.m. like everybody else and tell you guys all about the good news.
[303.74 --> 309.92]  So the big news in the tech industry this week was obviously Intel's 12th gen processors.
[309.92 --> 312.04]  They're codenamed Alder Lake.
[312.30 --> 315.48]  They are finally available to buy on the LGA 1700 platform.
[315.86 --> 324.58]  The 8 plus 8 core Core i9-12900K delivers performance that sometimes bests AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X,
[324.66 --> 329.38]  despite having half of its 16 cores designated as efficiency cores.
[329.38 --> 342.70]  And this unique architecture that Intel has here with up to 8 performance and up to 8 efficiency cores has resulted in some controversy around testing.
[343.48 --> 353.66]  So there's a couple of criticisms that were leveled at us over the way that we evaluated the Core i9-12900K.
[353.76 --> 357.18]  One of them was that we used Windows 11 for our testing.
[357.18 --> 361.94]  And we did provide some of the rationale in the video for why we used Windows 11.
[362.06 --> 370.52]  And the reason was that Windows 11 has an updated scheduler that is properly tuned to take advantage of the big little architecture of Alder Lake.
[370.74 --> 380.32]  Now, I know that some people were upset about this because Windows 11 hasn't really reached any kind of critical mass in terms of market share at this point.
[380.32 --> 391.10]  But the other reason that did not make it into the video, because frankly, I felt like the reason that it wouldn't perform properly if we didn't use Windows 11 was enough.
[391.40 --> 398.66]  The other reason that we used is that it's not as simple as just looking at what's the dominant operating system and going,
[398.66 --> 400.66]  Okay, let's test on that one.
[401.28 --> 412.66]  Because if someone is buying a brand new system today, the odds that they are going to choose Windows 11 over Windows 10 or anything else, especially for a gaming machine,
[412.66 --> 417.58]  and typically our reviews are more focused on gaming performance, are going to be much higher.
[417.58 --> 427.88]  So even though Windows 11's market share might be 3% or 5% or whatever, for people buying a brand new machine today, it will be markedly higher than that.
[428.22 --> 436.84]  So we felt that between making sure it's performing properly and trying to target what we think people buying Alder Lake CPUs are going to be using,
[436.96 --> 439.24]  that it made more sense to test with Windows 11.
[439.46 --> 444.82]  Is the concern there that people think the other CPUs are performing worse in Windows 11?
[444.82 --> 447.02]  Now, there is some truth to that.
[447.62 --> 452.06]  So Windows 11 has had scheduler issues with AMD.
[452.28 --> 458.00]  The good news is that literally, I think like two days, I don't want to say how many days,
[458.06 --> 463.36]  because I don't remember exactly when our chips arrived, but days before we actually started our testing,
[463.82 --> 471.84]  AMD provided a chipset driver update and Microsoft pushed an update for Windows 11 that fixed the scheduler on AMD CPUs.
[471.84 --> 474.38]  But there was an issue.
[475.28 --> 477.92]  An issue remained, okay?
[478.18 --> 482.46]  You could apply the fix, and your performance would be fixed.
[483.04 --> 489.10]  But, as was discovered by, I think Hardware Unboxed might have been the first ones to bring this to light,
[489.10 --> 498.20]  but if you change your CPU, if you swap it out, it can actually degrade back to the prefixed performance.
[498.44 --> 502.32]  Now, it's not a guarantee that that's going to happen every time, as we discovered,
[502.76 --> 507.78]  because, yes, guys, we didn't mention it in the video because the bug did not affect us.
[507.78 --> 515.62]  But, as we discovered, Anthony was able to swap CPUs, and all of our performance numbers still made sense.
[516.12 --> 521.74]  We didn't see just all of a sudden, like, absolutely tanked AMD performance numbers.
[521.98 --> 522.08]  Right.
[522.08 --> 532.08]  So, that was sort of, I think, the main controversy that there was around, in particular, our video was our choice of Windows 11.
[532.38 --> 534.52]  But I stand behind it 100%.
[534.52 --> 539.86]  I think that most people buying a brand new system today are going to install Windows 11.
[540.10 --> 541.20]  That's just how it works.
[541.20 --> 547.00]  The 12,000 series processors and Windows 11 were kind of hand-in-hand a bit, right?
[547.16 --> 549.60]  The new scheduler system and stuff, Intel was helping with that.
[550.00 --> 553.36]  I think, at the very least, you would have to include Windows 11 benchmarks.
[553.96 --> 556.46]  Maybe doing both could have been cool.
[556.46 --> 564.22]  So, both would have been interesting, but it would have, we already did, and this was pre-release,
[564.22 --> 567.96]  but we already took a look at gaming performance in Windows 10 versus Windows 11,
[568.10 --> 571.02]  found that it was not significantly different.
[571.20 --> 576.08]  So, basically, we're just doubling our number of benchmark runs for what?
[576.30 --> 578.10]  To prove the point that it's not different.
[578.22 --> 582.00]  To prove the point that it's not different, or to demonstrate that it is different with the 12900K,
[582.04 --> 585.88]  which we already know, and we made it clear that we recommend running Windows 11 with the 12900K.
[585.90 --> 586.54]  Yeah, yeah.
[586.62 --> 587.62]  So, then just don't do that.
[587.70 --> 591.76]  Just don't run Windows 10 with the 12900K, which might not appeal to you.
[592.24 --> 595.06]  Windows 11 is, it's going through some growing pains.
[595.06 --> 597.04]  Maybe a reason to not get the processor, yeah.
[597.16 --> 597.82]  Which is fine.
[598.24 --> 600.18]  You don't have to buy something on release date.
[600.38 --> 600.50]  Yeah.
[600.50 --> 604.46]  But you've got to remember that this content is going to be there a year from now, two years from now.
[605.04 --> 609.54]  And I want to upload what is going to be the most relevant piece of content,
[609.72 --> 612.56]  evaluating the performance of this product for the longest period of time.
[612.56 --> 619.28]  If someone wants to buy a used 12900K in four years, because they're still amazing, because they probably will be,
[619.94 --> 622.46]  they'll probably be running Windows 11.
[622.46 --> 623.42]  probably.
[623.42 --> 623.50]  Probably.
[624.72 --> 628.96]  So, there was another sort of controversy.
[630.60 --> 632.24]  Just one after the other.
[632.42 --> 632.70]  Yeah.
[632.90 --> 637.70]  The other controversy was that we used DDR5.
[638.50 --> 648.12]  And this is one of those ones where every single time, it's like, tell me you're a fanboy without telling me you're a fanboy.
[648.12 --> 656.34]  Every single time, whether it's AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Apple, I don't care.
[656.34 --> 661.96]  Every time one of them has some kind of technological advantage over the other.
[661.96 --> 670.56]  All of a sudden, evaluating that product against some other one is now unfair.
[671.50 --> 672.86]  It's unfair.
[673.76 --> 682.10]  Linus, you can't compare the latest iPhone to the Android handsets on the market because it uses a 5 nanometer chip,
[682.10 --> 683.52]  and those ones don't.
[683.78 --> 689.40]  Linus, you can't benchmark Intel with DDR5 because you're running AMD with DDR4.
[689.62 --> 692.26]  You need to benchmark Intel with DDR4 then.
[693.72 --> 696.06]  The number, the number of...
[696.06 --> 700.44]  That does muddy a bit the argument of the future performance stuff, though.
[700.74 --> 701.36]  Which one does?
[701.98 --> 705.10]  Because, like, AMD processors down the line will support DDR5.
[705.82 --> 707.94]  They will, but they'll be completely different processors.
[708.40 --> 710.40]  And we will test them with DDR5.
[710.76 --> 711.30]  Yeah, that's fair.
[711.30 --> 712.30]  Why would you ever...
[712.30 --> 713.00]  Yeah, never mind.
[713.10 --> 713.64]  I take it all back.
[714.22 --> 718.82]  So, I mean, and sometimes it gets really ridiculous.
[719.32 --> 724.20]  I remember back when AMD was using HBM memory in their GPUs,
[724.46 --> 728.66]  and Nvidia was still using a more conventional GDDR something or other.
[729.22 --> 734.88]  And you'd upload performance graphs demonstrating that,
[735.28 --> 737.76]  sorry, AMD, in spite of your expensive, fancy memory,
[737.76 --> 741.84]  the Nvidia card is, in fact, faster in applications XYZ.
[742.18 --> 743.42]  And then you'd have people going,
[743.92 --> 745.28]  but you guys didn't...
[745.28 --> 746.64]  You guys didn't account for it.
[746.64 --> 748.12]  The AMD's got HBM.
[748.44 --> 750.26]  I'm like, I don't care.
[750.76 --> 751.98]  It doesn't matter.
[752.64 --> 756.68]  What matters is how many dollars you hand to someone
[756.68 --> 760.34]  and how many FPSs you get back.
[760.60 --> 760.80]  Yeah.
[761.00 --> 762.90]  That ultimately is all that matters.
[762.90 --> 765.98]  And what we did was in the...
[765.98 --> 770.40]  Actually, it's so funny because I've been around the block a few times.
[770.40 --> 774.94]  And as Anthony and I were sitting in script review for the Alder Lake review,
[775.20 --> 782.84]  I went through and I added not one, but two sort of points,
[783.26 --> 787.24]  two spots in the script where I specifically acknowledged
[787.24 --> 792.00]  that DDR5 is significantly more expensive than DDR4,
[792.30 --> 795.72]  and that you have to consider the full platform cost
[795.72 --> 797.98]  when you're evaluating the value of a product.
[798.14 --> 799.76]  Which is like really high.
[800.76 --> 802.08]  Just looking right now.
[802.08 --> 803.28]  It's super high.
[803.62 --> 807.74]  But the thing is, the reason that I phrased it the way that I did,
[807.82 --> 812.76]  and the reason that I didn't go after DDR5 for being too expensive or whatever...
[813.38 --> 814.56]  Did you do price performance?
[815.18 --> 816.24]  No, we couldn't.
[816.34 --> 821.60]  Because the thing is that DDR5 pricing is going to be probably incredibly volatile
[821.60 --> 823.64]  over the coming few months.
[823.64 --> 825.30]  But like any commodity item,
[825.30 --> 829.94]  because we've seen these changeovers happen now five times,
[829.94 --> 832.00]  like any commodity item,
[832.20 --> 837.12]  you're going to see that volume production of DDR4, volume production of DDR5,
[837.20 --> 838.22]  they're going to go like this.
[838.54 --> 839.50]  They're going to cross.
[839.92 --> 843.40]  And at some point, DDR5 will become the same price as DDR4,
[843.48 --> 844.46]  and then it will be cheaper.
[844.94 --> 848.20]  And once again, we're producing these reviews for the long term,
[848.28 --> 849.40]  where we're evaluating, okay,
[849.40 --> 852.86]  in the context of what else was available on the market at the time,
[853.06 --> 854.86]  how does 12th gen perform?
[855.22 --> 862.14]  Did you show an example of 12th gen's performance utilizing DDR5 versus DDR4?
[862.18 --> 862.66]  We didn't.
[862.78 --> 865.40]  So what we would like to do is a follow-up video.
[865.72 --> 865.94]  Okay.
[865.94 --> 870.94]  But what I had gotten guidance on ahead of time from memory manufacturers
[870.94 --> 876.06]  was that if you're running overclocked DDR4 versus overclocked DDR5,
[876.28 --> 879.34]  you are going to end up in a very similar territory.
[879.78 --> 884.40]  And it is possible that the platform will have more headroom with DDR5,
[885.06 --> 890.12]  but it's pretty negligible.
[890.48 --> 891.40]  The only real reason,
[891.54 --> 894.24]  and I remember adding this to the script as well,
[894.24 --> 902.16]  the only real reason to go for DDR5 would be if you want to perhaps buy into a memory technology
[902.16 --> 904.76]  that you'll be able to carry forward with you to another system more easily.
[904.88 --> 906.60]  Try to leave some slots open or something.
[906.80 --> 909.84]  And to be clear, like I didn't make an argument for doing that,
[909.92 --> 911.06]  which I would never do.
[911.18 --> 916.18]  You should never buy system memory thinking this is an investment.
[917.18 --> 920.88]  I am going to, this is my memory.
[921.62 --> 923.22]  I'm going to use this memory.
[923.22 --> 927.50]  Because the thing is, the pricing only goes in one direction.
[928.00 --> 931.90]  The capacities only go in the other direction.
[932.22 --> 935.92]  And the speeds only go in the same direction as the capacity.
[936.28 --> 941.34]  So you are far better off going for whatever is the best bang for the buck today,
[941.80 --> 943.94]  assuming that by the time you retire this system,
[943.94 --> 946.78]  you're just going to leave it in it.
[946.78 --> 952.16]  And it'll go to a relative or you could sell the whole thing complete on Facebook marketplace
[952.16 --> 953.24]  or whatever the case may be.
[953.34 --> 956.38]  And you're probably going to go acquire new memory that's a better match.
[956.50 --> 960.08]  Because as we've seen, especially with Ryzen over the last few years,
[960.08 --> 963.30]  as these memory controllers have developed,
[963.56 --> 968.48]  faster and faster spec DDR4 has come out alongside it.
[968.66 --> 970.38]  And we've seen them kind of develop together
[970.38 --> 973.36]  and sort of help each other to continue to improve.
[973.40 --> 977.06]  And I suspect, especially because we're in the infancy of DDR5,
[977.16 --> 978.08]  that we're going to see the same thing.
[978.12 --> 979.46]  We're going to see tighter cast latencies.
[979.74 --> 981.30]  We're going to see higher speeds.
[981.50 --> 983.06]  We're going to see cost come down.
[983.06 --> 984.34]  All of this is going to happen.
[984.88 --> 990.68]  So we wanted to represent the platform as it will be moving forward.
[991.20 --> 992.28]  And also as it is today.
[992.48 --> 994.86]  I just like you kind of mentioned, it probably doesn't even matter.
[994.98 --> 998.18]  Someone in Flipplane chat, Zatharian, said,
[998.28 --> 1000.52]  hardware in box has DDR4 and DDR5 numbers,
[1000.64 --> 1002.86]  and the performance difference is almost negligible.
[1004.04 --> 1004.82]  So, yeah.
[1004.92 --> 1005.10]  Yep.
[1006.06 --> 1010.50]  So apparently Derbauer has information showing the same thing.
[1010.64 --> 1011.32]  So, yeah, who cares?
[1011.32 --> 1014.46]  So in a massive surprise to nobody,
[1014.96 --> 1018.50]  the super early new gen performs...
[1018.50 --> 1019.60]  This happens with RAM all the time.
[1019.72 --> 1021.10]  It happens every time.
[1021.22 --> 1021.38]  Yeah.
[1021.84 --> 1026.68]  Literally every single time we've gone to a new generation of DDR.
[1027.42 --> 1031.94]  The super mature, low-cost last gen is very competitive
[1031.94 --> 1034.64]  with the immature, high-cost new gen.
[1035.02 --> 1038.46]  And the only reason to really buy the brand new one
[1038.46 --> 1041.60]  is because you want to have the brand new one
[1041.60 --> 1043.84]  for whatever reason.
[1047.10 --> 1050.46]  Neo Cortez says, yeah, once the timings start to tighten,
[1050.80 --> 1052.12]  you'll start to see the difference.
[1052.24 --> 1052.34]  Yeah.
[1052.42 --> 1054.50]  And also once you see the speeds dramatically increase,
[1054.54 --> 1055.54]  you'll start to see the difference too.
[1055.64 --> 1057.62]  Like something that a lot of people, I don't know if,
[1057.74 --> 1062.58]  realize is that CAS latencies are not measured in like nanoseconds.
[1062.58 --> 1065.62]  Like that's not actually a unit of time.
[1065.82 --> 1068.38]  That is a unit of cycles.
[1068.90 --> 1069.00]  Yeah.
[1069.00 --> 1071.54]  So when you have memory that has like...
[1071.54 --> 1076.46]  That's one of the reasons actually that your CAS latencies go up so much
[1076.46 --> 1078.60]  as we go through the memory generations.
[1079.08 --> 1083.00]  But overall memory access latency isn't like...
[1083.54 --> 1085.66]  Double quadruple eight at least.
[1085.94 --> 1088.04]  16x what it was with DDR1.
[1088.14 --> 1091.88]  It doesn't work that way because as the memory frequency goes up,
[1091.88 --> 1093.72]  you actually...
[1094.26 --> 1096.72]  Even though you have more cycles,
[1097.72 --> 1101.10]  you're running at this much, much higher frequency per second.
[1101.64 --> 1105.44]  So the actual real time, like in fractions of a...
[1105.44 --> 1106.10]  Or not...
[1106.10 --> 1107.18]  Let's avoid the word fractions.
[1107.66 --> 1111.36]  But the actual time in seconds can end up very similar or even better
[1111.36 --> 1112.94]  once speeds ramp up enough.
[1113.44 --> 1116.80]  So that's a really important thing for people to understand
[1116.80 --> 1118.24]  because I see a lot of people looking at,
[1118.24 --> 1122.74]  oh, you've got like CAS latencies of 36 to 40 even on high-end kits for DDR5.
[1122.84 --> 1123.44]  Well, okay, yeah.
[1123.58 --> 1128.02]  But it's also running at a much higher frequency than you'll see on DDR4.
[1128.38 --> 1128.48]  Yeah.
[1131.46 --> 1135.00]  Horst says DDR5 is three times as expensive right now for the same capacity.
[1135.10 --> 1135.24]  Yeah.
[1135.28 --> 1139.16]  So I probably wouldn't go that route.
[1140.32 --> 1140.62]  Boop.
[1140.82 --> 1141.48]  Ba-da-boom.
[1142.06 --> 1142.30]  Okay.
[1143.20 --> 1145.08]  What else did we want to talk about here?
[1146.80 --> 1147.76]  Gaming performance.
[1147.76 --> 1148.44]  Great.
[1148.70 --> 1149.44]  With Alder Lake.
[1149.66 --> 1150.30]  I am...
[1150.30 --> 1154.76]  I'm actually pretty surprised that Intel managed to so decisively
[1154.76 --> 1156.14]  take back the performance crown.
[1156.48 --> 1163.20]  But if I was the kind of Intel fan that's been crying for the last couple of years,
[1163.40 --> 1169.76]  I wouldn't necessarily get all, you know, swaggery about it right now
[1169.76 --> 1174.34]  because AMD has stuff I think is rumored to be hitting.
[1174.34 --> 1180.34]  First half of 2022 that should bring them fully competitive with Intel again.
[1180.88 --> 1186.30]  And AMD has already pointed out that they don't need efficiency cores in order to boost
[1186.30 --> 1189.72]  their core count to 16 on their consumer platform.
[1189.72 --> 1193.94]  So, man, it is going to be real interesting.
[1194.10 --> 1196.94]  And AMD already has an efficiency advantage.
[1196.94 --> 1201.22]  So they definitely have more levers to pull in terms of squeezing more out of these chips.
[1201.22 --> 1202.22]  Yeah.
[1203.34 --> 1208.78]  We saw our Core i9 hitting as high as 96 degrees in blender with an NHG15.
[1209.18 --> 1211.60]  It's a really hot chip.
[1212.18 --> 1212.64]  It's...
[1212.64 --> 1215.36]  An NHG15 really struggling to cool something down.
[1215.44 --> 1215.76]  It's like...
[1216.76 --> 1218.40]  That's a bit of a yikers.
[1218.40 --> 1222.72]  Well, part of the problem is that it's not just the thermal output, right?
[1223.16 --> 1224.34]  Like, this is a consumer chip.
[1224.42 --> 1225.84]  This is not a gigantic die.
[1225.96 --> 1229.72]  Like, one of the things that I think people probably don't realize unless they've used them
[1229.72 --> 1232.46]  is that just because you've got a super high core count chip,
[1232.62 --> 1237.24]  that doesn't necessarily mean that it's really, really difficult to cool.
[1237.24 --> 1243.94]  So, AMD's Epic 64 cores, for example, are really easy to keep cool
[1243.94 --> 1248.68]  because the dies are not only, like, physically larger
[1248.68 --> 1251.46]  because there's 64 freaking cores in the thing,
[1251.58 --> 1255.04]  but they're also spread out because of AMD's chiplet design
[1255.04 --> 1256.96]  for their last couple generations of chips.
[1257.32 --> 1262.32]  So, what that means is that as long as you've got enough heat pipe
[1262.32 --> 1266.72]  and enough heatsink fin to deal with however many watts it is,
[1266.72 --> 1271.68]  the actual transfer of thermal energy between the CPU IHS
[1271.68 --> 1277.66]  and the bottom of the cooler is way, way more efficient, way faster.
[1278.06 --> 1281.16]  So, when you've got this tiny die, this consumer die,
[1281.42 --> 1283.44]  all that heat is concentrated in one place
[1283.44 --> 1287.50]  and the bottleneck becomes how fast you can move that heat
[1287.50 --> 1289.54]  across the base of the cooler
[1289.54 --> 1291.76]  before you can even send it up the heat pipes
[1291.76 --> 1293.66]  to start to dissipate it to the surrounding air.
[1293.66 --> 1299.50]  So, that's one of the reasons that this chip is so freaking hot.
[1299.62 --> 1302.24]  MSI actually did, I don't, was it a live stream?
[1302.34 --> 1303.90]  I can't remember. I saw the slides from it anyway.
[1304.26 --> 1307.78]  They showed that there's actually two different dies for Alder Lake
[1307.78 --> 1309.94]  depending on what the core configuration is
[1309.94 --> 1316.68]  and they both have their own kind of slightly off center.
[1316.76 --> 1318.98]  One of them is centered and I think the other one is slightly off centered.
[1319.08 --> 1320.58]  They have their own hotspots though
[1320.58 --> 1325.62]  which means that it's not even the area of the die
[1325.62 --> 1327.50]  that you need to focus all of your cooling.
[1328.02 --> 1332.16]  It's actually that particular part of the die
[1332.16 --> 1333.72]  where you need to focus almost all the cooling.
[1333.72 --> 1337.90]  So, once you're hitting this thing crazy hard with like a blender render
[1337.90 --> 1343.64]  that 96 degrees is because it can't move that heat
[1343.64 --> 1346.20]  out away from the hotspot of the die fast enough.
[1347.96 --> 1351.02]  Anyway, the Core i9 really wasn't the star of the show for me.
[1351.36 --> 1354.62]  The 12600K, which is a $320 CPU
[1354.62 --> 1359.16]  that offers darn near top tier gaming performance
[1359.16 --> 1364.70]  while competing with the Ryzen 5 5600X for price looks amazing.
[1365.62 --> 1367.98]  Now, AMD is clearly responding.
[1367.98 --> 1372.70]  So, Micro Center has already apparently discounted the 5800X.
[1373.36 --> 1375.14]  Dun-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[1376.26 --> 1376.74]  $299.
[1377.06 --> 1378.72]  To $299.
[1379.26 --> 1379.74]  Darn.
[1380.10 --> 1382.92]  Isn't competition great, right?
[1383.08 --> 1384.92]  So, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
[1385.16 --> 1386.66]  In pandemic times too.
[1387.06 --> 1388.90]  Every time you see a price drop.
[1389.08 --> 1390.98]  Every time you see a price drop, okay?
[1391.28 --> 1392.76]  Unless it's on clearance,
[1393.28 --> 1396.16]  that means they could have sold it at that price before.
[1397.72 --> 1400.72]  So, this is one of the things that I get really,
[1400.92 --> 1404.10]  I don't know, I get really exasperated about.
[1404.82 --> 1407.60]  Intel does not have a clean history, okay?
[1407.76 --> 1410.12]  It's not like they've forever been
[1410.12 --> 1412.64]  the world's most consumer-centric,
[1413.58 --> 1415.56]  you know, customer-friendly,
[1416.20 --> 1417.62]  competition-friendly,
[1417.74 --> 1419.88]  whatever it is you want to accuse them of,
[1420.14 --> 1421.74]  you could probably dig up some dirt.
[1422.22 --> 1424.96]  But don't imagine for a second
[1424.96 --> 1428.24]  that AMD is some kind of white knight, okay?
[1428.50 --> 1431.40]  They are a corporation beholden to their shareholders.
[1431.80 --> 1435.02]  If they can charge you $399.99
[1435.02 --> 1439.10]  instead of $299.99, they will.
[1441.20 --> 1446.32]  AMD started the whole Extreme Edition FX bullcrap.
[1446.98 --> 1448.24]  Don't kid yourself.
[1448.48 --> 1449.66]  When AMD is on top,
[1450.22 --> 1451.78]  which they have demonstrated,
[1452.32 --> 1453.42]  they did it immediately.
[1453.66 --> 1455.00]  The second they were on top,
[1455.62 --> 1458.00]  they slowed down the product release cadence,
[1458.42 --> 1461.08]  left their pricing where it was,
[1461.08 --> 1463.70]  and fair play AMD, right?
[1464.32 --> 1466.98]  We were in the middle of the biggest silicon shortage
[1466.98 --> 1468.48]  of certainly my lifetime,
[1468.68 --> 1470.80]  which would probably mean pretty much ever
[1470.80 --> 1472.18]  because consumer electronics
[1472.18 --> 1474.82]  have kind of only really been the thing in our lifetimes.
[1475.10 --> 1477.12]  So, you know, yeah, I'm not going to say,
[1477.22 --> 1478.42]  hey, you should sell something
[1478.42 --> 1480.32]  you don't even have enough stock of for half price.
[1480.40 --> 1480.96]  Yeah, fair enough.
[1481.50 --> 1484.38]  Yeah, they've legitimately been out of stock for a long time.
[1484.82 --> 1487.52]  Just don't treat this like this is
[1487.52 --> 1489.58]  an isolated to Intel thing
[1489.58 --> 1492.24]  or an isolated to NVIDIA thing.
[1492.66 --> 1494.34]  We need competition.
[1495.16 --> 1498.46]  Just because AMD being on top with no competition
[1498.46 --> 1500.40]  would be no better for consumers
[1500.40 --> 1502.30]  than Intel or NVIDIA doing it.
[1502.72 --> 1504.84]  So that's my spiel.
[1505.02 --> 1506.58]  I'm not going to say any more on the subject
[1506.58 --> 1507.76]  other than that.
[1508.30 --> 1511.34]  Dang, a 5800X for $299?
[1511.50 --> 1512.36]  That's pretty crazy.
[1512.56 --> 1513.76]  That's genuinely pretty crazy.
[1513.82 --> 1515.66]  That is a pretty darn good deal.
[1515.78 --> 1516.42]  It's a good time.
[1516.52 --> 1517.80]  I'm pretty into it.
[1517.80 --> 1519.30]  At least there's one computer part
[1519.30 --> 1521.72]  that I feel like is like pretty aggressively priced right now
[1521.72 --> 1523.10]  because everything else is just horrible.
[1523.56 --> 1525.74]  Well, yeah, okay.
[1525.92 --> 1527.00]  Maybe cases are okay.
[1527.10 --> 1527.84]  I haven't looked into it,
[1527.88 --> 1529.86]  but like, yeah, things are rough.
[1530.18 --> 1530.98]  Things are rough out there.
[1531.10 --> 1533.24]  Man, I mean, you cannot go wrong.
[1533.46 --> 1534.24]  When's the last time?
[1534.24 --> 1534.58]  Wow.
[1535.30 --> 1539.60]  When's the last time that I could say 100% straight faced as a gamer?
[1540.22 --> 1541.22]  You can't go wrong.
[1542.70 --> 1547.44]  AMD, Intel, flip a coin, decide what color you like better,
[1547.52 --> 1548.78]  who has the better box art.
[1548.86 --> 1549.62]  Both really strong.
[1549.74 --> 1552.80]  You're going to be really happy with your gaming performance
[1552.80 --> 1554.32]  no matter which way you go.
[1554.32 --> 1558.70]  And next generation could easily flip around.
[1558.94 --> 1559.54]  Let's see.
[1560.12 --> 1560.38]  Man.
[1560.84 --> 1561.32]  Pretty cool.
[1561.50 --> 1562.00]  It's pretty cool.
[1562.34 --> 1565.24]  I freaking love it.
[1565.38 --> 1569.74]  Something that I thought was really interesting about the Z690 platform
[1569.74 --> 1573.62]  is that while it does support PCI Express Gen 5,
[1573.74 --> 1580.52]  I had sort of expected PCI Express Gen 5 to make its way into the storage.
[1580.52 --> 1586.72]  But the way the CPUs are actually configured is with 16 PCI Express Gen 5 lanes,
[1586.82 --> 1591.72]  which are by default just all shunted over to the PCIe 16x slot,
[1591.82 --> 1595.22]  meaning that the only devices that are going to be able to take advantage
[1595.22 --> 1599.00]  of PCI Express Gen 5 on a typical consumer system are going to be GPUs.
[1599.26 --> 1606.64]  So we are pretty much stuck with PCI Express Gen 4 storage speeds for the...
[1606.64 --> 1613.56]  At least until AMD releases a PCIe Gen 5 platform,
[1613.56 --> 1617.10]  because it's pretty clear that if Intel thought there was a benefit to it,
[1617.14 --> 1619.34]  they could have built in another five lanes.
[1619.38 --> 1621.64]  But you want to know what my conspiracy theory is about this?
[1622.26 --> 1626.66]  I think that ultimately it's the current gen consoles that are dictating
[1626.66 --> 1630.10]  how fast storage should be today.
[1631.02 --> 1631.54]  Interesting.
[1631.54 --> 1635.10]  I also think there's really not much point building an M.2 NVMe drive
[1635.10 --> 1636.72]  on a PCI Express Gen 5 interface,
[1636.72 --> 1640.60]  because we're already under realistic loads.
[1640.92 --> 1641.90]  Like other than just,
[1642.46 --> 1646.86]  all right, I got part of this drive in SLC cache mode,
[1646.96 --> 1650.34]  and I am sequentially reading and writing data,
[1650.46 --> 1651.18]  and that's it.
[1651.38 --> 1654.72]  In any other reasonably real-world workload,
[1654.72 --> 1660.58]  we are so far from even fully utilizing PCI Express Gen 4 by 4,
[1661.00 --> 1662.74]  that it's a joke,
[1662.78 --> 1664.98]  because we're limited by the controllers,
[1665.18 --> 1667.18]  we're limited by especially the NAND dyes.
[1667.60 --> 1671.98]  And that's not going to change as we get to 5-bit per cell flash.
[1672.60 --> 1674.18]  That stuff ain't getting faster.
[1674.30 --> 1674.88]  And if anything,
[1675.26 --> 1678.36]  it's become more difficult to find flash devices
[1678.36 --> 1681.06]  that will perform the way that you might expect them to
[1681.06 --> 1681.98]  based on the spec sheet.
[1682.50 --> 1683.26]  Yeah, yeah.
[1683.38 --> 1684.34]  Things are getting a little messy.
[1684.34 --> 1684.78]  Right?
[1684.90 --> 1688.00]  I mean, we've got these 12K cameras that we're getting rid of,
[1688.26 --> 1690.12]  but those 12K Blackmagic cameras,
[1690.34 --> 1693.24]  and finding an external USB-C drive
[1693.24 --> 1697.60]  that could actually handle sustained writes
[1697.60 --> 1701.22]  at those kinds of bit rates was extremely difficult,
[1701.22 --> 1703.74]  even though almost all of them had a label
[1703.74 --> 1705.72]  that said they should be able to handle it just fine.
[1706.50 --> 1708.94]  But that's because most of them are using
[1708.94 --> 1711.62]  some kind of caching algorithm
[1711.62 --> 1714.28]  to intelligently write really quickly
[1714.28 --> 1716.94]  and then flush that to slower NAND
[1716.94 --> 1720.06]  that's running in a different operating mode over time.
[1721.16 --> 1723.76]  Because the dyes just aren't capable of it,
[1723.80 --> 1726.24]  and you're not going to be able to just parallelize it more
[1726.24 --> 1729.22]  because you're limited by this M.2 form factor
[1729.22 --> 1730.30]  that you can put a maximum of what?
[1730.36 --> 1731.78]  Like four NAND dyes on?
[1731.78 --> 1733.40]  That's it.
[1734.04 --> 1736.86]  So until we stack them higher,
[1737.66 --> 1739.40]  eliminate some of those internal bottlenecks,
[1739.40 --> 1741.56]  I can see why until basically went,
[1741.66 --> 1744.94]  yeah, PCIe Gen 5 storage is just not a thing for now,
[1745.04 --> 1746.54]  so I guess let's just not bother.
[1747.54 --> 1750.44]  And if there's going to be any kind of benefit
[1750.44 --> 1751.88]  from faster storage on the desktop,
[1752.56 --> 1753.50]  especially for gamers,
[1753.50 --> 1755.00]  I think it's pretty much going to come down
[1755.00 --> 1756.12]  to Microsoft Direct Storage.
[1756.12 --> 1760.14]  You mentioned gamers a couple of times,
[1760.30 --> 1763.54]  like consoles holding back and stuff like that.
[1763.86 --> 1766.72]  Do you think that really influences hardware stuff that much?
[1767.26 --> 1768.86]  Well, I think what it influences
[1768.86 --> 1774.74]  is figuring out what you're targeting for a platform.
[1774.74 --> 1777.58]  So right now, what we know is
[1777.58 --> 1779.28]  Microsoft is working on direct storage,
[1779.28 --> 1780.82]  which is going to allow PC gamers
[1780.82 --> 1782.72]  to get similar functionality
[1782.72 --> 1785.30]  to what the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series is,
[1785.44 --> 1786.58]  have where they,
[1787.10 --> 1788.64]  especially in the case of the PlayStation 5,
[1788.76 --> 1792.94]  might even be able to actively stream assets
[1792.94 --> 1798.16]  from the SSD straight to the video cards frame buffer
[1798.16 --> 1803.28]  and without even passing through system memory.
[1803.28 --> 1806.92]  So that's super cool, right?
[1808.58 --> 1811.66]  But the, sorry, what was your question?
[1811.84 --> 1813.68]  Actually, he slept like two and a half hours last night.
[1813.74 --> 1815.16]  I can barely keep my brain going.
[1815.26 --> 1815.98]  Yeah, no, all good.
[1816.68 --> 1817.68]  Right, are we limited?
[1817.80 --> 1818.30]  Right, right, right.
[1818.46 --> 1820.64]  So what we know is that we've got this functionality
[1820.64 --> 1821.62]  coming to the PC.
[1821.76 --> 1822.74]  That's on the horizon.
[1823.06 --> 1825.88]  But beyond that, faster storage on the desktop
[1825.88 --> 1829.32]  has been for freaking lulls for a long time.
[1829.32 --> 1833.12]  Maybe it's changed under Pat Gelsinger's guidance,
[1833.28 --> 1835.94]  but we probably both remember
[1835.94 --> 1837.54]  there was a certain content creator
[1837.54 --> 1840.30]  that was brought to Intel back in the day
[1840.30 --> 1844.16]  to like explain why gamers care at all
[1844.16 --> 1845.46]  about Intel CPUs.
[1845.46 --> 1845.48]  Yes.
[1845.60 --> 1847.88]  Because the board just had no idea
[1847.88 --> 1849.96]  that people use their CPUs for gaming.
[1851.36 --> 1852.88]  That was awkward.
[1853.50 --> 1855.24]  So sometimes, I'm just kind of wondering,
[1855.38 --> 1858.36]  like, are they actually comparing against consoles?
[1858.36 --> 1859.26]  Do they actually care?
[1859.56 --> 1862.68]  Do they really think about gamers at all?
[1862.84 --> 1863.98]  Maybe they do more these days.
[1864.04 --> 1866.46]  Maybe that meeting had a little bit more impact.
[1866.58 --> 1867.70]  It's also entirely possible
[1867.70 --> 1869.50]  that this was mainly a marketing bullet point.
[1869.64 --> 1871.64]  But why would you bother making it
[1871.64 --> 1873.12]  a marketing bullet point unless you think
[1873.12 --> 1874.46]  there's some kind of compelling story
[1874.46 --> 1875.44]  you can tell around it, right?
[1875.52 --> 1877.82]  And that's a compelling story
[1877.82 --> 1879.76]  that I would probably want to tell.
[1879.84 --> 1881.52]  Yeah, we've got PCI Express Gen 5,
[1881.52 --> 1884.52]  which on the desktop is going to be for gaming.
[1885.32 --> 1885.40]  Yeah.
[1885.52 --> 1886.06]  That's it.
[1886.06 --> 1887.76]  Like workstation, yeah, sure.
[1887.84 --> 1888.92]  Totally different conversation.
[1889.06 --> 1891.36]  And there's a rumored X699 platform.
[1891.60 --> 1893.68]  So it looks like we're going to get
[1893.68 --> 1895.34]  an HEDT platform again.
[1895.86 --> 1896.30]  Absolutely.
[1896.56 --> 1898.08]  You go PCI Express Gen 5 there.
[1898.14 --> 1899.36]  Now we're talking high-speed networking.
[1899.48 --> 1902.34]  Now we're talking high-speed storage arrays, right?
[1902.34 --> 1904.04]  We're not talking one drive
[1904.04 --> 1905.68]  because you might actually be working
[1905.68 --> 1908.08]  with large scientific data sets
[1908.08 --> 1911.58]  that you need to be able to parse extremely quickly, right?
[1911.58 --> 1913.20]  You might have these enormous databases
[1913.20 --> 1914.64]  that you're looking things up
[1914.64 --> 1915.82]  and you might need all this IO, right?
[1916.62 --> 1918.40]  On the desktop, you don't need that.
[1918.58 --> 1920.22]  The main thing pushing forward
[1920.22 --> 1922.90]  the need for faster PCI Express on the desktop
[1922.90 --> 1924.18]  is going to be gaming,
[1924.34 --> 1926.88]  whether it's that top 16x slot for your GPU
[1926.88 --> 1928.22]  or whether it's your storage.
[1928.76 --> 1931.58]  And we know that console generations,
[1931.78 --> 1934.76]  they refresh, what, every like four to seven years
[1934.76 --> 1936.62]  or whatever the numbers are,
[1936.70 --> 1937.62]  unless your name is Nintendo,
[1937.74 --> 1939.26]  in which case you just slap a new screen on it
[1939.26 --> 1939.80]  and call it a day.
[1939.80 --> 1943.40]  So what we know is that for literally
[1943.40 --> 1946.46]  the entire service life of a PC
[1946.46 --> 1947.84]  that someone is going to buy today,
[1947.94 --> 1949.10]  like a typical service life,
[1949.18 --> 1950.04]  five or six years,
[1950.78 --> 1955.66]  no game developer is going to target faster storage
[1955.66 --> 1957.64]  than PCI Express Gen 4x4.
[1957.86 --> 1957.98]  Yeah.
[1958.82 --> 1961.18]  That's it because that's what Sony's got
[1961.18 --> 1962.22]  in the PlayStation 5
[1962.22 --> 1964.22]  and then Microsoft's actually half that speed,
[1964.30 --> 1965.06]  if I recall correctly.
[1965.06 --> 1969.62]  So I do think that that could be a factor.
[1969.76 --> 1972.28]  It's also probable that they were working
[1972.28 --> 1975.18]  on the design for this platform three years ago
[1975.18 --> 1977.10]  and might've just had no idea.
[1977.20 --> 1977.66]  For all they knew,
[1977.72 --> 1980.86]  maybe NVIDIA was going to have a PCIe Gen 5 GPU
[1980.86 --> 1981.84]  to launch at this time.
[1982.26 --> 1983.88]  Maybe that got delayed by the pandemic
[1983.88 --> 1985.96]  and the whole thing was supposed to line up
[1985.96 --> 1987.80]  and it, oh, whoops, I guess we've got,
[1987.80 --> 1990.38]  I guess we've got Gen 5 motherboards
[1990.38 --> 1992.24]  and no Gen 5 devices to put in them.
[1992.60 --> 1992.98]  Sorry.
[1992.98 --> 1995.34]  I mean, remember that whole awkward thing
[1995.34 --> 1997.36]  where AMD hadn't updated their chipsets
[1997.36 --> 2000.88]  for like however many years in the dark time,
[2000.96 --> 2001.92]  the bulldozer times?
[2002.04 --> 2002.26]  Yeah.
[2002.50 --> 2005.20]  And AMD went out and launched,
[2005.30 --> 2005.74]  what was it?
[2005.84 --> 2010.02]  Gen 3, Gen 3 GPUs
[2010.02 --> 2015.16]  when they literally didn't have a Gen 3 platform
[2015.16 --> 2016.92]  that you could stick these GPUs in.
[2016.98 --> 2017.22]  Yeah.
[2017.36 --> 2017.98]  So poor AMD.
[2017.98 --> 2018.86]  That was rude.
[2019.14 --> 2019.76]  There was a lot of memes.
[2020.00 --> 2020.10]  Yeah.
[2020.22 --> 2021.48]  So poor AMD, right?
[2021.48 --> 2024.26]  They had to do their launch video
[2024.26 --> 2025.70]  using an Intel platform
[2025.70 --> 2026.86]  to show off the gaming performance
[2026.86 --> 2028.82]  of their poor graphics card, right?
[2028.86 --> 2030.62]  I mean, not anymore, obviously,
[2030.84 --> 2032.90]  but those kinds of things absolutely happen.
[2033.00 --> 2034.42]  You can't expect all of these ducks
[2034.42 --> 2036.28]  to magically, perfectly align, right?
[2037.48 --> 2039.92]  Speaking of magically, perfectly aligning ducks,
[2041.22 --> 2041.78]  sponsor spots?
[2042.46 --> 2044.84]  Yes, we should definitely talk about sponsor spots.
[2044.98 --> 2045.54]  Oh my goodness.
[2045.58 --> 2046.66]  We've only gotten through a couple of topics.
[2046.76 --> 2048.84]  We've got so much stuff to talk about today, guys.
[2048.84 --> 2051.84]  The show is brought to you today by...
[2051.84 --> 2054.10]  Spanning.
[2056.10 --> 2058.54]  Spanning is an easy-to-use software-as-a-service
[2058.54 --> 2061.48]  data protection solution for Microsoft 365,
[2061.92 --> 2063.34]  Google Workspace, and Salesforce
[2063.34 --> 2065.50]  that enables administrators and users
[2065.50 --> 2067.38]  to restore data and get back to work
[2067.38 --> 2068.78]  in just a few clicks.
[2069.38 --> 2070.80]  Spanning's world-class backup solution
[2070.80 --> 2072.82]  is designed for enterprises and MSPs
[2072.82 --> 2074.04]  and comes with features to protect
[2074.04 --> 2075.38]  your most critical cloud data,
[2075.46 --> 2077.46]  including mail, contacts, events,
[2078.00 --> 2080.70]  files, Salesforce records, and metadata.
[2081.34 --> 2083.04]  Prevent data loss from ever happening
[2083.04 --> 2083.72]  in the first place
[2083.72 --> 2086.24]  with Spanning's premium dark web monitoring feature,
[2086.32 --> 2088.42]  which alerts admins when compromised credentials
[2088.42 --> 2089.44]  are found on the dark web.
[2089.50 --> 2090.70]  That's actually kind of...
[2090.70 --> 2091.66]  That's kind of cool.
[2091.90 --> 2092.02]  Yeah.
[2092.52 --> 2095.22]  It's like, you'll no longer have an excuse
[2095.22 --> 2097.04]  to be browsing the dark web at work, I guess.
[2097.04 --> 2100.44]  But as a native cloud solution,
[2100.64 --> 2101.86]  Spanning requires no hardware,
[2102.04 --> 2102.70]  installed software,
[2102.86 --> 2104.02]  network bandwidth data center space,
[2104.12 --> 2105.14]  management, or maintenance.
[2105.96 --> 2106.20]  Nothing.
[2106.62 --> 2108.16]  It sets up in as little as 60 seconds
[2108.16 --> 2109.76]  and you can get 50% off list price
[2109.76 --> 2111.98]  by checking it out at spanning.com slash Linus
[2111.98 --> 2113.28]  or at the link down below.
[2113.38 --> 2115.04]  The show is also brought to you by MSI.
[2115.80 --> 2118.74]  MSI's Spatium M470 NVMe SSD
[2118.74 --> 2119.98]  offers sequential read speeds
[2119.98 --> 2121.78]  of up to 5,000 megabytes per second
[2121.78 --> 2123.20]  and sequential write speeds
[2123.20 --> 2125.60]  of up to 4,400 megabytes per second,
[2125.60 --> 2126.90]  which is completely irrelevant
[2126.90 --> 2128.58]  because it means absolutely nothing
[2128.58 --> 2131.56]  for daily use other than big number.
[2132.28 --> 2132.76]  Big.
[2134.90 --> 2135.38]  Yes.
[2136.20 --> 2141.42]  But it is rated for up to 3,300 terabytes written,
[2141.54 --> 2142.92]  which means that the endurance of it
[2142.92 --> 2143.86]  is looking pretty good.
[2144.18 --> 2146.34]  It uses a PCI Express Gen 4x4 interface
[2146.34 --> 2147.60]  with built-in data security
[2147.60 --> 2148.70]  and error correction capabilities.
[2149.12 --> 2150.78]  It's available in one and two terabyte capacities
[2150.78 --> 2153.46]  in the M.2 2280 form factor,
[2153.54 --> 2154.96]  so it's the 80 millimeter long one,
[2154.96 --> 2156.94]  and offers a five-year warranty,
[2157.10 --> 2159.10]  so that's probably a result
[2159.10 --> 2162.66]  of that big chungus endurance rating on it.
[2163.14 --> 2164.78]  It's also brought to you by Ridge Wallet.
[2164.88 --> 2166.60]  Thanks to Ridge Wallet for sponsoring the WAN show.
[2166.80 --> 2167.28]  With Ridge Wallet,
[2167.30 --> 2168.34]  you can stop carrying around
[2168.34 --> 2170.02]  old hotel room keys, receipts,
[2170.16 --> 2170.86]  spent gift cards,
[2170.94 --> 2171.64]  all that kind of crap.
[2171.76 --> 2173.50]  Ridge Wallet helps you carry less.
[2173.88 --> 2174.80]  They use two metal plates
[2174.80 --> 2175.42]  that are bound together
[2175.42 --> 2176.44]  by a strong elastic band
[2176.44 --> 2177.72]  to hold your cards in place,
[2177.80 --> 2179.40]  but still make them easily accessible.
[2179.54 --> 2180.48]  They're RFID blocking.
[2180.72 --> 2181.78]  They offer a lifetime guarantee,
[2181.78 --> 2182.70]  and they're available in aluminum,
[2182.88 --> 2184.02]  carbon fiber, and titanium.
[2184.02 --> 2185.88]  They also have far more than just wallets.
[2185.94 --> 2186.74]  They've got battery banks,
[2186.96 --> 2188.46]  bags, smartphone covers, and more.
[2188.62 --> 2189.54]  And if you use offer code WAN,
[2189.72 --> 2192.16]  you can save 10% on everything
[2192.16 --> 2194.44]  at ridge.com slash WAN.
[2195.20 --> 2199.24]  Now, I need like 10 seconds.
[2199.28 --> 2201.08]  I need a 10 second gap right now.
[2201.44 --> 2201.66]  Okay.
[2202.50 --> 2203.78]  Wait, where I talk?
[2203.78 --> 2204.96]  Oh.
[2210.96 --> 2211.32]  Okay.
[2211.40 --> 2212.72]  Hopefully Ridge Wallet's not watching
[2212.72 --> 2213.26]  by this point,
[2213.32 --> 2214.58]  because they have bags.
[2215.04 --> 2216.08]  We're going to have our own bag.
[2216.88 --> 2217.28]  Oh.
[2217.48 --> 2220.54]  So I haven't really shown this in detail.
[2221.28 --> 2223.82]  It sort of made a cameo
[2223.82 --> 2225.58]  in the framework video.
[2225.58 --> 2225.78]  Yeah.
[2225.78 --> 2225.86]  Yeah.
[2226.20 --> 2228.04]  But this is a new sample,
[2228.04 --> 2232.06]  and we are getting close, boys.
[2232.32 --> 2233.90]  This is going to be...
[2233.90 --> 2234.68]  Oh, I like that.
[2234.86 --> 2236.04]  On the zipper protector.
[2236.58 --> 2237.30]  That's pretty cool.
[2237.62 --> 2238.96]  Sorry, it's a very minor detail,
[2239.08 --> 2240.48]  but it says Linus Tech Tips on the zipper protector.
[2240.48 --> 2241.00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2241.08 --> 2242.62]  It says Linus Tech Tips here.
[2242.62 --> 2243.80]  You probably can't even see that on camera.
[2243.80 --> 2247.12]  Like the zipper water seal.
[2247.46 --> 2247.62]  Yeah.
[2248.06 --> 2249.92]  This bag is freaking sick.
[2250.04 --> 2251.78]  One of the first things that...
[2251.78 --> 2253.50]  I was talking to Colin and David.
[2253.58 --> 2253.98]  They were like,
[2254.36 --> 2255.66]  yeah, the problem with backpacks
[2255.66 --> 2258.32]  is they never have enough slips
[2258.32 --> 2260.66]  for all the stuff that...
[2260.66 --> 2262.90]  Like sleeves to slide things into.
[2263.18 --> 2263.88]  Check this out.
[2266.18 --> 2267.22]  This is going to be really hard
[2267.22 --> 2268.26]  to talk into our microphones
[2268.26 --> 2269.30]  while we're also...
[2269.30 --> 2269.68]  Oh, my...
[2269.68 --> 2269.90]  Do you want me to try to
[2269.90 --> 2270.92]  van-a-white it for you?
[2271.00 --> 2271.74]  No, no, it's fine.
[2272.04 --> 2273.64]  So basically, you've got your sleeve,
[2273.80 --> 2274.44]  for your laptop.
[2274.74 --> 2275.90]  Another sleeve for a tablet.
[2276.20 --> 2277.36]  There's a bit of a miscommunication
[2277.36 --> 2278.50]  with the factory on this sample.
[2278.84 --> 2279.80]  It's going to be microfiber,
[2279.90 --> 2281.34]  not whatever this weird vinyl is.
[2281.64 --> 2283.86]  Another one that we're going to double check.
[2284.06 --> 2284.62]  So we're going to check
[2284.62 --> 2285.94]  the dimensions of the Steam Deck.
[2286.02 --> 2286.98]  Make sure that fits.
[2287.06 --> 2288.34]  Make sure the Nintendo Switch fits.
[2288.72 --> 2290.02]  So you'll be able to get all that in there.
[2290.12 --> 2290.78]  And then you've got
[2290.78 --> 2292.92]  another two pockets up here.
[2293.00 --> 2294.08]  I've got my battery bank.
[2294.20 --> 2295.18]  I've got my...
[2295.18 --> 2296.46]  This is my dongle pocket.
[2297.04 --> 2298.34]  And then the main pocket,
[2298.76 --> 2300.02]  you'll probably notice
[2300.02 --> 2301.32]  it has like a really rigid
[2301.32 --> 2302.96]  kind of square shape to it.
[2303.02 --> 2303.34]  Like it doesn't...
[2303.80 --> 2305.68]  actually compress very much.
[2305.86 --> 2307.14]  Just not to derail you,
[2307.20 --> 2308.20]  but we've got a couple questions
[2308.20 --> 2308.70]  in the chat.
[2308.88 --> 2309.90]  What's the biggest size
[2309.90 --> 2310.74]  of a laptop that fits?
[2310.88 --> 2311.26]  17.
[2311.52 --> 2311.90]  17.
[2312.90 --> 2314.32]  This is like full bag
[2314.32 --> 2315.14]  of holding style.
[2316.46 --> 2318.30]  Pretty much completely unencumbered.
[2318.44 --> 2319.04]  Native support
[2319.04 --> 2321.08]  for our 40 ounce water bottle.
[2321.08 --> 2321.54]  Oh, cool.
[2321.60 --> 2322.76]  It's got a little holder for it.
[2323.02 --> 2324.60]  Got another little slip here.
[2324.84 --> 2326.70]  Got your sunglasses pouch.
[2326.70 --> 2328.72]  I really like our sunglasses pouch.
[2328.72 --> 2330.04]  It uses like this kind of...
[2330.04 --> 2330.52]  Here, feel it.
[2330.86 --> 2334.52]  It's like a gel for the film.
[2335.02 --> 2336.20]  So we didn't want to go with a hard one
[2336.20 --> 2337.44]  because it was going to take away
[2337.44 --> 2338.38]  from being able to...
[2338.38 --> 2339.76]  Like I managed to put a Jackery
[2339.76 --> 2341.10]  portable power bank in here.
[2341.76 --> 2343.50]  Like, you know, those ones.
[2344.00 --> 2344.14]  Yeah.
[2344.28 --> 2345.76]  So we wanted it to stay square.
[2345.86 --> 2348.02]  So you could like really put big stuff in it.
[2348.16 --> 2349.52]  And that was going to interfere with that
[2349.52 --> 2350.20]  and make it kind of hard
[2350.20 --> 2351.12]  to get stuff in and out.
[2351.46 --> 2352.40]  So we went with this.
[2352.46 --> 2353.42]  It's kind of a good balance
[2353.42 --> 2356.08]  between protection and flexibility.
[2356.80 --> 2358.78]  Here, we're going to reconfigure these pockets.
[2358.78 --> 2359.82]  I think I've got some notes
[2359.82 --> 2360.74]  for Nick and Bridget.
[2360.94 --> 2362.48]  I think we're going to have this open
[2362.48 --> 2363.92]  on these three sides
[2363.92 --> 2365.52]  rather than open up on the bottom
[2365.52 --> 2366.32]  because it just makes it
[2366.32 --> 2367.20]  so you can't really store anything
[2367.20 --> 2367.88]  in here right now.
[2368.04 --> 2368.82]  And then we're going to have
[2368.82 --> 2370.56]  a full length one for the screwdriver.
[2371.36 --> 2373.24]  So you can put your LTT screwdriver
[2373.24 --> 2374.94]  when that's finally available
[2374.94 --> 2376.14]  all the way down here.
[2376.24 --> 2376.52]  You got a bunch of...
[2376.52 --> 2377.10]  Is that one?
[2377.30 --> 2378.14]  That is one, isn't it?
[2378.24 --> 2378.38]  Yeah.
[2378.42 --> 2379.12]  Have you not seen it yet?
[2379.30 --> 2379.52]  No.
[2379.84 --> 2380.34]  Oh, all right.
[2380.64 --> 2380.98]  There you go.
[2381.36 --> 2381.72]  Sweet.
[2385.02 --> 2386.52]  And then finally...
[2386.52 --> 2389.02]  On the other side,
[2389.08 --> 2390.28]  you got a nice little side pocket
[2390.28 --> 2391.10]  that has a pass-through
[2391.10 --> 2392.12]  in case you want to run a cable
[2392.12 --> 2393.16]  from this mesh in here.
[2393.28 --> 2393.94]  Passport pocket.
[2394.68 --> 2396.56]  I am jazzed.
[2396.62 --> 2397.86]  This thing is so overbuilt.
[2398.16 --> 2399.56]  Check out these rivets on the handle.
[2403.46 --> 2404.94]  There's three on either side.
[2405.30 --> 2406.78]  The idea is that
[2406.78 --> 2408.42]  you could probably basically
[2408.42 --> 2409.48]  tow a car with it.
[2409.86 --> 2410.60]  Oh, my goodness.
[2410.60 --> 2411.74]  That's crazy.
[2411.92 --> 2412.96]  And there's a ton of stuff
[2412.96 --> 2413.60]  that's like that,
[2413.68 --> 2414.30]  like double stitched.
[2414.62 --> 2415.24]  The bag's heavy
[2415.24 --> 2416.24]  because the bottom,
[2416.42 --> 2417.38]  the entire bottom,
[2417.58 --> 2418.80]  has two full layers
[2418.80 --> 2419.44]  of this material.
[2420.00 --> 2421.76]  So if you drag your bag around,
[2421.90 --> 2422.56]  you're the kind of person
[2422.56 --> 2423.02]  who gets home
[2423.02 --> 2423.54]  and just like
[2423.54 --> 2424.64]  hucks your bag
[2424.64 --> 2425.56]  into the corner
[2425.56 --> 2426.40]  and it's like
[2426.40 --> 2427.14]  it wears away.
[2427.14 --> 2430.04]  there's a full additional layer
[2430.04 --> 2432.54]  of the same material,
[2432.54 --> 2434.80]  like that same rugged material
[2434.80 --> 2436.88]  that you would have to wear through
[2436.88 --> 2437.52]  in order to wear
[2437.52 --> 2438.32]  all the way through the bag.
[2439.10 --> 2439.26]  Yeah.
[2439.70 --> 2440.74]  Sorry, I'm a little distracted
[2440.74 --> 2441.28]  by the screwdriver.
[2441.36 --> 2442.08]  So I'm pretty excited.
[2442.54 --> 2442.66]  Yeah.
[2442.66 --> 2443.74]  Have you not been hands-on
[2443.74 --> 2444.18]  with this yet?
[2444.22 --> 2444.76]  Not once.
[2445.20 --> 2446.04]  Feels really good.
[2446.56 --> 2447.36]  Of course it does.
[2447.42 --> 2448.30]  I'm pretty stoked.
[2448.62 --> 2448.82]  Yeah.
[2448.86 --> 2449.72]  Alex and Kyle
[2449.72 --> 2451.50]  did a fantastic job.
[2452.20 --> 2452.80]  I really like
[2452.80 --> 2453.66]  how the ratchet feels.
[2453.90 --> 2454.84]  Just switching the ratchet
[2454.84 --> 2455.98]  feels really nice.
[2456.26 --> 2458.04]  The ratchet might end up
[2458.04 --> 2459.02]  being a little smoother.
[2459.96 --> 2460.58]  So it comes down.
[2460.58 --> 2461.52]  I didn't actually turn it
[2461.52 --> 2461.92]  because I didn't want
[2461.92 --> 2462.46]  to go through the mic
[2462.46 --> 2464.00]  but just switching the ratchet.
[2464.34 --> 2464.54]  Yeah.
[2464.66 --> 2465.94]  It feels nice.
[2466.02 --> 2466.38]  It's good.
[2466.60 --> 2466.76]  Yeah.
[2467.06 --> 2467.46]  It's good.
[2467.58 --> 2468.02]  We're excited.
[2468.14 --> 2469.24]  You guys should have a bundle.
[2469.96 --> 2470.84]  I'm mostly talking
[2470.84 --> 2471.74]  to like Conrad and Nick
[2471.74 --> 2472.16]  about this.
[2472.34 --> 2472.90]  But you guys should have
[2472.90 --> 2473.82]  a bundle called
[2473.82 --> 2474.58]  like fully loaded
[2474.58 --> 2475.10]  or something.
[2475.40 --> 2475.82]  Fully loaded.
[2475.82 --> 2476.38]  Where you get like
[2476.38 --> 2476.94]  the backpack
[2476.94 --> 2478.34]  and then it has
[2478.34 --> 2478.78]  a screwdriver
[2478.78 --> 2479.36]  that's like
[2479.36 --> 2480.62]  in the screwdriver slot already
[2480.62 --> 2481.46]  and it comes with
[2481.46 --> 2482.12]  a water bottle
[2482.12 --> 2483.40]  and it has some like
[2483.40 --> 2484.54]  some shirts in it
[2484.54 --> 2484.94]  or whatever.
[2484.94 --> 2485.22]  That's actually
[2485.22 --> 2486.22]  a pretty good idea.
[2486.78 --> 2487.08]  I mean.
[2487.44 --> 2488.12]  And it like ships
[2488.12 --> 2489.18]  as like the bag.
[2489.36 --> 2490.62]  It would depend on us
[2490.62 --> 2491.66]  being able to actually
[2491.66 --> 2492.60]  keep all of these items
[2492.60 --> 2493.24]  in stock.
[2493.54 --> 2493.92]  That would.
[2494.28 --> 2495.30]  Remember how I warned
[2495.30 --> 2496.76]  people on WAN show
[2496.76 --> 2497.54]  last week
[2497.54 --> 2499.14]  that WAN hoodies
[2499.14 --> 2500.62]  were going to sell out?
[2501.04 --> 2501.84]  They go.
[2502.24 --> 2503.00]  They're gone.
[2503.36 --> 2504.90]  I think we're out of stock
[2504.90 --> 2507.02]  of at least three sizes now.
[2507.46 --> 2507.94]  We still have
[2507.94 --> 2509.20]  small, medium, large
[2509.20 --> 2510.14]  no small, medium,
[2510.14 --> 2511.06]  sorry large is gone.
[2511.62 --> 2512.54]  XL we have.
[2512.84 --> 2513.64]  3XL is gone.
[2513.80 --> 2514.98]  So there's still
[2514.98 --> 2516.22]  a handful
[2516.22 --> 2517.24]  in a few sizes
[2517.24 --> 2519.40]  and that's not
[2519.40 --> 2519.80]  what I'm supposed
[2519.80 --> 2520.48]  to talk about
[2520.48 --> 2521.90]  for LTT store today
[2521.90 --> 2522.22]  actually.
[2522.36 --> 2523.28]  I'm supposed to talk
[2523.28 --> 2525.96]  about the whole bunch
[2525.96 --> 2527.36]  of new designs.
[2528.02 --> 2528.58]  Speaking of which
[2528.58 --> 2531.50]  the notifier thing
[2531.50 --> 2531.98]  that you guys
[2531.98 --> 2532.50]  have probably seen
[2532.50 --> 2533.60]  popping up around
[2533.60 --> 2534.82]  this part of the screen.
[2535.48 --> 2536.24]  Not anymore
[2536.24 --> 2536.94]  but you know.
[2537.06 --> 2537.20]  Yeah.
[2537.20 --> 2539.44]  There's a way
[2539.44 --> 2540.02]  to send messages
[2540.02 --> 2540.34]  with that.
[2540.40 --> 2540.84]  If you guys buy
[2540.84 --> 2541.92]  merch during the show
[2541.92 --> 2543.24]  and choose to
[2543.24 --> 2543.92]  send a message
[2543.92 --> 2544.30]  right now
[2544.30 --> 2544.78]  we just see
[2544.78 --> 2545.58]  your first name
[2545.58 --> 2547.72]  and we can
[2547.72 --> 2548.42]  get a message
[2548.42 --> 2548.82]  from you
[2548.82 --> 2549.44]  and then we will
[2549.44 --> 2550.42]  do that super chat
[2550.42 --> 2551.16]  style at the end
[2551.16 --> 2551.50]  of the show.
[2551.60 --> 2552.18]  We'll go through
[2552.18 --> 2552.78]  those messages.
[2553.22 --> 2553.88]  Got some great
[2553.88 --> 2554.54]  new designs.
[2555.26 --> 2555.98]  This one's
[2555.98 --> 2556.80]  really different.
[2557.16 --> 2557.44]  Yes.
[2557.54 --> 2557.96]  There we go.
[2558.04 --> 2558.20]  Cool.
[2558.28 --> 2558.84]  I like this shirt.
[2559.00 --> 2559.20]  Yeah.
[2559.24 --> 2560.22]  I really like it too.
[2560.34 --> 2561.06]  It's just kind of
[2561.06 --> 2561.98]  cool.
[2562.18 --> 2563.04]  Kind of retro-y looking.
[2563.80 --> 2564.50]  And then finally
[2564.50 --> 2565.18]  we've got
[2565.18 --> 2566.28]  bananas for scale
[2566.28 --> 2566.90]  as well.
[2567.02 --> 2567.30]  Yes.
[2567.88 --> 2568.60]  So these are just
[2568.60 --> 2569.66]  little plushy bananas
[2569.66 --> 2570.48]  if you like having
[2570.48 --> 2571.44]  a little banana for scale
[2571.44 --> 2571.86]  we've got them
[2571.86 --> 2572.18]  in a bunch of
[2572.18 --> 2572.82]  different colors.
[2573.20 --> 2574.16]  Sarah worked on these.
[2574.24 --> 2574.72]  They've got a little
[2574.72 --> 2575.54]  short circuit logo
[2575.54 --> 2575.98]  on them.
[2576.32 --> 2576.48]  There.
[2576.64 --> 2577.56]  That was the stuff
[2577.56 --> 2578.28]  that I was supposed
[2578.28 --> 2579.12]  to talk about
[2579.12 --> 2581.72]  for LTT store
[2581.72 --> 2582.84]  and also the new
[2582.84 --> 2583.90]  newsletter is out.
[2584.22 --> 2584.84]  It's got a little
[2584.84 --> 2585.96]  article that Sarah
[2585.96 --> 2586.54]  wrote up
[2586.54 --> 2588.02]  that's about sort of
[2588.02 --> 2589.24]  how she chooses colors
[2589.24 --> 2590.84]  which is the kind of
[2590.84 --> 2591.58]  thing you might not
[2591.58 --> 2592.88]  think about or might
[2592.88 --> 2594.00]  not know that you
[2594.00 --> 2595.30]  care about but she
[2595.30 --> 2596.42]  did a great job and I
[2596.42 --> 2597.04]  thought it was really
[2597.04 --> 2597.46]  interesting.
[2598.04 --> 2598.64]  She kind of talked
[2598.64 --> 2599.38]  through like here's
[2599.38 --> 2600.36]  the four colors we
[2600.36 --> 2602.24]  did not go with for
[2602.24 --> 2603.40]  our beanies that we
[2603.40 --> 2604.34]  were that we had
[2604.34 --> 2605.46]  selected but then we
[2605.46 --> 2606.12]  got the samples and
[2606.12 --> 2606.64]  we're like no.
[2607.34 --> 2608.66]  She explains how like
[2608.66 --> 2609.38]  different material
[2609.38 --> 2610.90]  choices can change the
[2610.90 --> 2612.02]  way that a color looks
[2612.02 --> 2613.54]  once it's in the real
[2613.54 --> 2613.96]  world.
[2614.44 --> 2615.18]  It's actually pretty
[2615.18 --> 2615.84]  cool so make sure you
[2615.84 --> 2616.56]  sign up for the LTT
[2616.56 --> 2617.22]  store newsletter.
[2617.38 --> 2617.62]  We're going to have
[2617.62 --> 2618.14]  lots of behind the
[2618.14 --> 2618.72]  scenes stuff there.
[2619.96 --> 2621.10]  I tried Dungeons and
[2621.10 --> 2621.56]  Dragons for the
[2621.56 --> 2622.24]  first time today.
[2622.44 --> 2623.28]  Yes you did.
[2623.70 --> 2626.16]  We did a collab with
[2626.16 --> 2627.06]  A Filthy Lot so
[2627.06 --> 2627.62]  they're a local
[2627.62 --> 2628.98]  production company
[2628.98 --> 2630.12]  that's really focused
[2630.12 --> 2631.20]  on Dungeons and
[2631.20 --> 2632.22]  Dragons content and
[2632.22 --> 2632.98]  then a bunch of other
[2632.98 --> 2635.08]  random stuff and so
[2635.08 --> 2636.00]  they're launching their
[2636.00 --> 2637.80]  flagship show today
[2637.80 --> 2639.24]  ready to roll so we
[2639.24 --> 2640.06]  kind of went down just
[2640.06 --> 2641.42]  wanted to support our
[2641.42 --> 2644.48]  local online video
[2644.48 --> 2648.10]  bruhs and let me
[2648.10 --> 2650.10]  tell you it was an
[2650.10 --> 2650.60]  experience.
[2650.60 --> 2652.08]  So you're the more
[2652.08 --> 2653.68]  experienced D&D player
[2653.68 --> 2654.98]  obviously of the two
[2654.98 --> 2655.30]  of us.
[2655.52 --> 2656.90]  How would you describe
[2656.90 --> 2658.24]  the what would I call
[2658.24 --> 2658.88]  it a mission a
[2658.88 --> 2659.24]  scenario?
[2659.66 --> 2660.30]  What did we do?
[2660.70 --> 2662.10]  We did a one shot
[2662.10 --> 2663.52]  they're often referred to
[2663.52 --> 2664.38]  as one shots which is
[2664.38 --> 2665.02]  where you have like a
[2665.02 --> 2665.88]  campaign and a set of
[2665.88 --> 2666.96]  characters that you're
[2666.96 --> 2668.00]  only planning on playing
[2668.00 --> 2669.44]  one time or for one
[2669.44 --> 2670.48]  day or whatever.
[2671.16 --> 2671.96]  Oh I should pull up my
[2671.96 --> 2672.36]  character.
[2672.36 --> 2675.60]  His character was
[2675.60 --> 2676.00]  ridiculous.
[2676.34 --> 2677.10]  The chat had figured
[2677.10 --> 2678.44]  out his like stat line
[2678.44 --> 2680.74]  by the end of the game
[2680.74 --> 2681.76]  and we're just like
[2681.76 --> 2682.80]  what?
[2683.18 --> 2684.98]  Because in you know
[2684.98 --> 2686.24]  casual Linus fashion
[2686.24 --> 2687.20]  he was attempting to
[2687.20 --> 2688.98]  troll pretty much as
[2688.98 --> 2689.80]  hard as possible.
[2690.30 --> 2691.30]  If you've seen the
[2691.30 --> 2695.92]  tech longer that Riley
[2695.92 --> 2697.06]  filmed about Star Citizen
[2697.06 --> 2698.06]  you'll probably have been
[2698.06 --> 2700.50]  you know first first
[2700.50 --> 2701.42]  hand witness to some of
[2701.42 --> 2701.70]  that.
[2702.38 --> 2704.56]  But yeah it's it was
[2704.56 --> 2704.76]  fun.
[2704.96 --> 2705.40]  It was interesting.
[2706.44 --> 2707.86]  So we did a one shot
[2707.86 --> 2710.48]  and I created a
[2710.48 --> 2712.52]  character Linus Tech
[2712.52 --> 2713.00]  69.
[2713.34 --> 2714.60]  That's his name in game
[2714.60 --> 2715.46]  by the way.
[2715.58 --> 2716.70]  Yeah Linus Tech 69.
[2717.20 --> 2719.46]  He was a halfling
[2719.46 --> 2720.26]  barbarian.
[2721.82 --> 2723.60]  Let me why don't you
[2723.60 --> 2725.06]  talk through the
[2725.06 --> 2726.22]  adventure we went on
[2726.22 --> 2726.42]  today.
[2726.52 --> 2727.12]  I'm going to get signed
[2727.12 --> 2727.22]  in.
[2727.28 --> 2727.92]  I'm going to see if I can
[2727.92 --> 2728.58]  pull up the.
[2728.66 --> 2729.74]  So we started in this
[2729.74 --> 2730.74]  town that has this
[2730.74 --> 2731.76]  like effectively like
[2731.76 --> 2733.16]  haunted castle thing.
[2733.82 --> 2735.38]  The person that hired
[2735.38 --> 2736.28]  us there brought us
[2736.28 --> 2737.02]  into this basement.
[2737.28 --> 2738.12]  We got introduced to
[2738.12 --> 2738.90]  the task that we
[2738.90 --> 2739.50]  needed to do.
[2740.16 --> 2741.36]  For some reason he
[2741.36 --> 2743.00]  had a body there
[2743.00 --> 2745.40]  that he revealed and
[2745.40 --> 2746.10]  then just kind of like
[2746.10 --> 2747.46]  looked at for a while
[2747.46 --> 2749.44]  until it's like stomach
[2749.44 --> 2750.26]  exploded and there's
[2750.26 --> 2751.22]  weird larva stuff.
[2751.86 --> 2752.68]  And then Linus tried
[2752.68 --> 2753.54]  to eat one.
[2754.74 --> 2756.00]  Yeah I did try to eat
[2756.00 --> 2756.20]  one.
[2756.36 --> 2756.94]  I think I ended up
[2756.94 --> 2757.64]  taking some poison
[2757.64 --> 2758.06]  damage.
[2758.18 --> 2758.44]  Yes.
[2758.66 --> 2758.86]  Yeah.
[2759.64 --> 2760.70]  And then after we
[2760.70 --> 2761.64]  killed those things we
[2761.64 --> 2763.04]  go to the castle go
[2763.04 --> 2763.86]  down into the bottom
[2763.86 --> 2765.94]  and we engage in
[2765.94 --> 2766.22]  combat.
[2766.34 --> 2767.06]  We roll for initiative.
[2767.28 --> 2768.36]  So tell me something
[2768.36 --> 2770.74]  for the people who
[2770.74 --> 2772.00]  don't play D&D.
[2772.14 --> 2772.82]  How would you how
[2772.82 --> 2773.94]  would you like explain
[2773.94 --> 2775.92]  what the heck D&D is?
[2776.28 --> 2777.44]  It's it's like if you
[2777.44 --> 2780.52]  if you took generally
[2780.52 --> 2782.44]  I believe D&D kind of
[2782.44 --> 2783.26]  has to be this way but
[2783.26 --> 2784.10]  most most tabletop
[2784.10 --> 2784.86]  things I would say are
[2784.86 --> 2786.16]  generally fantasy.
[2786.16 --> 2787.60]  If you took a fantasy
[2787.60 --> 2791.40]  RPG co-op game and
[2791.40 --> 2792.66]  you tried to instead of
[2792.66 --> 2794.26]  making it a video game
[2794.26 --> 2795.44]  you made it a tabletop
[2795.44 --> 2795.70]  game.
[2796.04 --> 2796.54]  Well there you go.
[2796.80 --> 2798.48]  A lot of original video
[2798.48 --> 2799.82]  game versions of fantasy
[2799.82 --> 2801.92]  RPG games are like a
[2801.92 --> 2803.34]  hundred percent based on
[2803.34 --> 2803.72]  D&D.
[2803.86 --> 2805.04]  They're either campaigns
[2805.04 --> 2806.40]  that the original writers
[2806.40 --> 2807.94]  or game developers ran
[2807.94 --> 2809.06]  with their friends back in
[2809.06 --> 2809.72]  the day and they just
[2809.72 --> 2810.76]  still had the notes for
[2810.76 --> 2812.90]  that was like genuinely
[2812.90 --> 2814.10]  a way that some old
[2814.10 --> 2815.14]  games were made.
[2816.12 --> 2817.14]  A lot of the ways that
[2817.14 --> 2817.90]  the mechanics in those
[2817.90 --> 2818.78]  games work were based
[2818.78 --> 2819.72]  on D&D all that kind of
[2819.72 --> 2819.86]  stuff.
[2819.96 --> 2821.02]  So kind of instead of
[2821.02 --> 2822.06]  going forward like
[2822.06 --> 2822.80]  things did if you go
[2822.80 --> 2823.76]  backwards you can kind
[2823.76 --> 2824.86]  of figure out how it
[2824.86 --> 2825.04]  would work.
[2825.16 --> 2826.42]  So basically the real
[2826.42 --> 2827.98]  challenge of the
[2827.98 --> 2830.16]  scenario today was that
[2830.16 --> 2832.40]  they had to carry me a
[2832.40 --> 2833.86]  level five lightfoot
[2833.86 --> 2835.96]  halfling barbarian with
[2835.96 --> 2838.14]  a constitution of eight
[2838.14 --> 2840.74]  and what was my other
[2840.74 --> 2841.96]  particularly stupid
[2841.96 --> 2844.20]  strength of eight as
[2844.20 --> 2844.38]  well.
[2844.48 --> 2846.36]  Yeah strength of eight
[2846.36 --> 2847.66]  which which I know that
[2847.66 --> 2848.86]  might not mean much but
[2848.86 --> 2850.18]  essentially that's a very
[2850.18 --> 2851.88]  low number that's I
[2851.88 --> 2852.62]  believe as low as you
[2852.62 --> 2855.12]  can possibly go and
[2855.12 --> 2856.28]  those are the two stats
[2856.28 --> 2857.04]  that he should have the
[2857.04 --> 2858.08]  highest and an armor
[2858.08 --> 2859.00]  class of 10.
[2859.48 --> 2860.42]  Also low.
[2860.66 --> 2862.44]  I dumped all of my I
[2862.44 --> 2863.36]  dumped all of my
[2863.36 --> 2864.94]  additional points into
[2864.94 --> 2867.48]  charisma and then once I
[2867.48 --> 2868.72]  capped out charisma I
[2868.72 --> 2869.64]  dumped the rest into
[2869.64 --> 2870.02]  wisdom.
[2870.22 --> 2871.12]  You never got to use
[2871.12 --> 2872.18]  your paint kit.
[2872.56 --> 2874.18]  I know I grabbed the
[2874.18 --> 2875.32]  most I grabbed the most
[2875.32 --> 2876.34]  interesting inventory
[2876.34 --> 2877.68]  items that I could find
[2877.68 --> 2878.80]  so I brought an abacus
[2878.80 --> 2880.26]  with me down to the
[2880.26 --> 2880.62]  dungeon.
[2880.96 --> 2882.04]  I brought some painter
[2882.04 --> 2882.08]  supplies.
[2883.08 --> 2884.72]  I brought a whip which I
[2884.72 --> 2885.58]  did end up using.
[2885.86 --> 2887.08]  I attempted to use my
[2887.08 --> 2889.20]  plus six animal handling
[2889.20 --> 2892.48]  talent to tame a mouse
[2892.48 --> 2894.30]  and it turns out that
[2894.30 --> 2895.16]  according to the dungeon
[2895.16 --> 2896.82]  master anyway mice are
[2896.82 --> 2898.90]  bound to run away when
[2898.90 --> 2899.52]  you crack a whip.
[2899.68 --> 2900.32]  But then they followed
[2900.32 --> 2900.90]  you later.
[2901.60 --> 2902.36]  Yeah yeah I don't know
[2902.36 --> 2903.26]  she told me the mice were
[2903.26 --> 2904.16]  following me again later
[2904.16 --> 2905.16]  but by that time we were
[2905.16 --> 2907.70]  fighting this like moth
[2907.70 --> 2908.66]  demon moth thing.
[2908.82 --> 2910.18]  Yeah moth demon thing.
[2910.64 --> 2912.98]  So I gotta say that I
[2912.98 --> 2916.42]  I see how it could be a
[2916.42 --> 2917.88]  ton of fun like if you got
[2917.88 --> 2920.32]  into it like I've my big
[2920.32 --> 2921.72]  thing and I've always kind
[2921.72 --> 2922.60]  of I've always kind of been
[2922.60 --> 2924.44]  of the mind that like oh
[2924.44 --> 2926.32]  man I just honestly I
[2926.32 --> 2927.28]  just I can't get into
[2927.28 --> 2930.62]  this and I'm still I'm I
[2930.62 --> 2931.82]  have that yeah today's
[2931.82 --> 2932.80]  today's experience has
[2932.80 --> 2934.26]  caused that opinion to
[2934.26 --> 2936.38]  completely stay exactly the
[2936.38 --> 2938.66]  same because it's it's
[2938.66 --> 2940.00]  just obvious that there is
[2940.00 --> 2942.86]  so much to know and not
[2942.86 --> 2943.54]  just for the dungeon
[2943.54 --> 2944.66]  master but also for the
[2944.66 --> 2946.20]  players if you want the
[2946.20 --> 2948.10]  game to progress smoothly.
[2948.60 --> 2949.30]  Yeah like there were
[2949.30 --> 2950.74]  clearly times when the fact
[2950.74 --> 2951.96]  that I had no idea what I
[2951.96 --> 2953.28]  was doing I mean aside
[2953.28 --> 2954.48]  from being a troll and
[2954.48 --> 2955.62]  trying to lick everything
[2955.62 --> 2956.48]  that I found on the
[2956.48 --> 2959.06]  floor that it just it kind
[2959.06 --> 2959.94]  of slowed down the
[2959.94 --> 2960.74]  progression of the game
[2960.74 --> 2962.76]  because I don't know what
[2962.76 --> 2964.88]  characteristics affect which
[2964.88 --> 2965.96]  things I might attempt to
[2965.96 --> 2967.30]  do or whatever.
[2967.60 --> 2968.22]  To be fair that that is
[2968.22 --> 2970.40]  true for a lot I guess not
[2970.40 --> 2972.50]  as much anymore as games
[2972.50 --> 2973.12]  are getting more and more
[2973.12 --> 2974.58]  simplified but that is
[2974.58 --> 2975.60]  true for a lot of things
[2975.60 --> 2976.50]  and a lot of games in
[2976.50 --> 2976.74]  general.
[2976.86 --> 2977.82]  Yeah so that's the big
[2977.82 --> 2979.22]  reason why I kind of like I
[2979.22 --> 2980.64]  look at and I just go yeah
[2980.64 --> 2982.54]  I have no idea how I would
[2982.54 --> 2984.16]  how I would possibly get
[2984.16 --> 2986.14]  into this but to just play
[2986.14 --> 2987.72]  and be taken along for the
[2987.72 --> 2989.34]  ride totally fun.
[2989.58 --> 2989.66]  Yeah.
[2989.78 --> 2991.02]  Yeah totally totally
[2991.02 --> 2992.38]  different from any other
[2992.38 --> 2993.38]  games that I've played
[2993.38 --> 2994.68]  before and it was it was
[2994.68 --> 2996.12]  actually it was it was
[2996.12 --> 2996.62]  pretty fun.
[2997.18 --> 2997.90]  Will I do it again?
[2998.00 --> 2999.98]  Probably no time soon but
[2999.98 --> 3001.84]  especially because I don't
[3001.84 --> 3003.64]  think if anyone were to
[3003.64 --> 3005.26]  watch the VOD of that
[3005.26 --> 3006.92]  mission today that anyone
[3006.92 --> 3008.10]  would invite me to play.
[3009.36 --> 3010.40]  I would.
[3010.94 --> 3012.44]  I at one point had an
[3012.44 --> 3014.00]  opportunity to contribute
[3014.00 --> 3015.52]  to the assault on the
[3015.52 --> 3017.88]  monster and I decided to
[3017.88 --> 3019.76]  eat my food.
[3019.98 --> 3021.06]  Pretzels and trail mix.
[3021.14 --> 3022.22]  Yeah eat my trail mix
[3022.22 --> 3023.62]  instead and then.
[3023.84 --> 3024.18]  It's a good choice.
[3024.34 --> 3027.00]  I did throw my javelin at
[3027.00 --> 3027.52]  the monster.
[3027.66 --> 3028.84]  Just waved.
[3028.84 --> 3029.98]  Well in the direction of
[3029.98 --> 3030.46]  the monster.
[3030.76 --> 3031.42]  Just roughly yeah.
[3031.42 --> 3033.18]  I did exactly zero damage
[3033.18 --> 3037.20]  to the opposing team and
[3037.20 --> 3038.80]  then Luke actually managed
[3038.80 --> 3041.04]  to almost tank the entire
[3041.04 --> 3042.34]  the entire opponent that
[3042.34 --> 3042.96]  we had today.
[3043.30 --> 3043.64]  Bonked him.
[3045.00 --> 3046.26]  Bonked him because Luke
[3046.26 --> 3047.22]  apparently knows what he's
[3047.22 --> 3048.72]  doing even though I.
[3048.92 --> 3050.10]  Vaguely I haven't played
[3050.10 --> 3051.38]  actual D&D in a really
[3051.38 --> 3052.48]  long time but I've played a
[3052.48 --> 3054.42]  bunch of tabletop systems.
[3055.78 --> 3056.30]  So.
[3057.20 --> 3058.14]  Yeah it was fun.
[3058.28 --> 3058.76]  So thanks.
[3058.84 --> 3060.50]  Thanks filthy lot for the
[3060.50 --> 3062.42]  invite and good luck with
[3062.42 --> 3063.38]  your with your new show
[3063.38 --> 3064.66]  and all that good stuff.
[3064.96 --> 3065.86]  Someone in chat said where
[3065.86 --> 3067.62]  can we spectate this lovely
[3067.62 --> 3068.18]  content.
[3068.52 --> 3069.86]  I'm assuming it will be a
[3069.86 --> 3071.18]  a VOD.
[3072.16 --> 3074.94]  I have no idea how
[3074.94 --> 3076.02]  they've got things set up
[3076.02 --> 3077.74]  because they've taken some
[3077.74 --> 3081.54]  fairly unique approaches
[3081.54 --> 3083.20]  like for example they're
[3083.20 --> 3084.02]  they're premiering their new
[3084.02 --> 3084.72]  show today right.
[3084.72 --> 3086.12]  Like I said well they
[3086.12 --> 3088.86]  decided to live stream it
[3088.86 --> 3090.88]  to Twitch and then I
[3090.88 --> 3092.98]  actually don't know if
[3092.98 --> 3093.70]  there's a VOD.
[3094.18 --> 3094.56]  Oh yeah.
[3094.72 --> 3096.24]  Looks like there's a VOD.
[3096.64 --> 3096.78]  Yeah.
[3097.08 --> 3097.98]  It looks like they do have
[3097.98 --> 3098.88]  a VOD on Twitch though.
[3099.12 --> 3099.14]  On Twitch.
[3099.30 --> 3099.60]  Yes.
[3100.24 --> 3101.34]  So if you go to a filthy
[3101.34 --> 3102.34]  lot one word.
[3102.76 --> 3103.00]  Yeah.
[3103.12 --> 3104.22]  You guys can you guys can
[3104.22 --> 3105.14]  go check out the VOD.
[3105.28 --> 3106.30]  Luke Luke played too.
[3106.50 --> 3107.44]  He was he was very
[3107.44 --> 3107.80]  helpful.
[3108.22 --> 3109.72]  I was probably a lot less
[3109.72 --> 3110.74]  interesting but.
[3111.50 --> 3112.92]  Oh man I had fun.
[3113.22 --> 3113.68]  I did too.
[3113.84 --> 3114.28]  I had fun.
[3114.36 --> 3115.62]  I tried to steal from the
[3115.62 --> 3116.96]  quest giver like immediately.
[3117.48 --> 3117.70]  Yeah.
[3117.70 --> 3119.38]  And then I lost I lost hit
[3119.38 --> 3119.74]  points.
[3119.84 --> 3120.86]  Well not technically the
[3120.86 --> 3121.36]  quest giver.
[3121.66 --> 3121.84]  No.
[3122.00 --> 3122.60]  The corpse.
[3123.26 --> 3124.14]  You tried to loot the
[3124.14 --> 3124.24]  corpse.
[3124.24 --> 3124.70]  Oh that's right.
[3124.76 --> 3125.18]  I tried to.
[3125.30 --> 3125.86]  Is the corpse his like
[3125.86 --> 3126.04]  that.
[3126.22 --> 3126.36]  Yeah.
[3126.46 --> 3126.58]  Yeah.
[3126.58 --> 3127.54]  I don't even know why he
[3127.54 --> 3128.10]  attacked me.
[3128.28 --> 3128.46]  I don't.
[3129.46 --> 3130.90]  Or did I try to maybe I
[3130.90 --> 3131.88]  did try to steal from the
[3131.88 --> 3132.30]  quest giver.
[3132.40 --> 3132.74]  Oh no I did.
[3132.80 --> 3133.48]  I tried to loot the
[3133.48 --> 3134.42]  corpse that was there like
[3134.42 --> 3134.72]  immediately.
[3134.72 --> 3135.86]  Then he like smashed your
[3135.86 --> 3136.06]  finger.
[3136.14 --> 3136.94]  I thought I was playing
[3136.94 --> 3137.56]  Final Fantasy.
[3138.02 --> 3139.06]  You just loot all the
[3139.06 --> 3139.36]  things.
[3139.52 --> 3139.64]  Yeah.
[3139.92 --> 3141.06]  You're like in someone's
[3141.06 --> 3141.86]  house like having a
[3141.86 --> 3142.54]  conversation with.
[3142.54 --> 3143.72]  We smash your jars.
[3144.06 --> 3144.76]  One sec can I just.
[3144.76 --> 3147.00]  We break all your
[3147.00 --> 3147.36]  pottery.
[3147.62 --> 3148.56]  I need I need rupees.
[3148.76 --> 3149.50]  Now I have a confession.
[3149.90 --> 3151.72]  I have not touched my
[3151.72 --> 3152.90]  computer in the last week
[3152.90 --> 3155.08]  because I just have been
[3155.08 --> 3156.98]  busy and also it's.
[3159.28 --> 3162.26]  It's more work than I want
[3162.26 --> 3164.30]  to do the things that I
[3164.30 --> 3164.88]  want to do.
[3165.54 --> 3166.46]  Is that a form of quitting.
[3166.90 --> 3167.14]  No.
[3168.14 --> 3168.58]  No.
[3168.58 --> 3170.00]  I don't have to use my
[3170.00 --> 3170.74]  computer at home.
[3172.16 --> 3172.64]  Ever.
[3173.06 --> 3174.40]  And it's still well like
[3174.40 --> 3174.64]  OK.
[3174.70 --> 3174.90]  OK.
[3174.96 --> 3175.56]  I shouldn't say I haven't
[3175.56 --> 3176.24]  touched like I've sent
[3176.24 --> 3177.32]  some emails and stuff like
[3177.32 --> 3178.38]  it's it's it's still my
[3178.38 --> 3179.14]  daily driver computer.
[3179.26 --> 3179.90]  I haven't pulled up my
[3179.90 --> 3180.68]  laptop at home.
[3180.74 --> 3181.04]  OK.
[3181.32 --> 3181.96]  To use.
[3182.08 --> 3182.32]  No no.
[3182.46 --> 3184.36]  I just I haven't.
[3184.36 --> 3184.38]  I haven't.
[3184.38 --> 3186.02]  I interpreted that as like
[3186.02 --> 3187.78]  you avoided that computer.
[3187.88 --> 3188.72]  I didn't game all week.
[3188.98 --> 3189.22]  OK.
[3189.68 --> 3190.54]  I did play some Mario Kart
[3190.54 --> 3191.48]  with my kids but that
[3191.48 --> 3191.80]  doesn't count.
[3192.10 --> 3192.34]  Yeah.
[3192.50 --> 3193.50]  I didn't game all week.
[3193.68 --> 3194.66]  So I don't really have
[3194.66 --> 3195.46]  any updates on the Linux
[3195.46 --> 3196.86]  challenge but you alluded
[3196.86 --> 3198.78]  in the pre-show to having
[3198.78 --> 3200.26]  some significant updates.
[3200.36 --> 3200.56]  Yeah.
[3200.82 --> 3201.92]  So we didn't really.
[3202.08 --> 3203.74]  So the last challenge we
[3203.74 --> 3204.72]  were like thinking about
[3204.72 --> 3206.32]  doing it this week and
[3206.32 --> 3207.74]  then we technically have
[3207.74 --> 3208.98]  more time because we have
[3208.98 --> 3211.02]  until the 10th I think.
[3211.24 --> 3211.54]  Yeah.
[3211.76 --> 3212.40]  Something like that.
[3212.44 --> 3213.56]  That's still next Wednesday
[3213.56 --> 3215.36]  and then like it could
[3215.36 --> 3216.26]  extend whatever.
[3216.62 --> 3217.76]  We have one more challenge
[3217.76 --> 3218.56]  that we need to do.
[3219.10 --> 3220.34]  One more specific challenge
[3220.34 --> 3221.88]  that goes alongside us
[3221.88 --> 3222.88]  just having to use it all
[3222.88 --> 3223.18]  the time.
[3223.18 --> 3226.50]  I have increased the amount
[3226.50 --> 3227.18]  of computers.
[3229.50 --> 3229.94]  Really?
[3230.14 --> 3230.72]  My laptop.
[3231.44 --> 3232.70]  You're going Linux on the
[3232.70 --> 3234.00]  laptop on the Razerblade.
[3234.22 --> 3234.38]  Yeah.
[3235.68 --> 3236.12]  Interesting.
[3236.64 --> 3236.96]  OK.
[3237.74 --> 3237.94]  Yeah.
[3238.04 --> 3238.88]  Tell me about this.
[3239.10 --> 3240.76]  Oh well I have said
[3240.76 --> 3241.96]  from the very there's
[3241.96 --> 3242.92]  there's things that Linux
[3242.92 --> 3244.42]  is really really really
[3244.42 --> 3245.30]  really good at
[3245.30 --> 3246.90]  and there's things that are
[3246.90 --> 3247.88]  you know a little rough
[3247.88 --> 3249.64]  and this whole challenge
[3249.64 --> 3251.04]  is based around gaming.
[3251.86 --> 3253.60]  So we've been kind of
[3253.60 --> 3255.18]  shoved head first
[3255.18 --> 3256.04]  into a lot of the stuff
[3256.04 --> 3257.00]  that's pretty rough.
[3257.54 --> 3257.98]  Right.
[3258.20 --> 3258.38]  Right.
[3258.84 --> 3260.12]  But like the and
[3260.12 --> 3261.50]  and I feel like maybe
[3261.50 --> 3262.42]  we haven't done this enough
[3262.42 --> 3263.36]  because the community
[3263.36 --> 3264.10]  is really butthurt
[3264.10 --> 3264.76]  but then I feel like
[3264.76 --> 3265.36]  the community is going to
[3265.36 --> 3265.94]  be really butthurt
[3265.94 --> 3266.78]  no matter what we do
[3266.78 --> 3267.68]  so I don't know.
[3268.68 --> 3270.78]  But like infrastructure
[3270.78 --> 3272.78]  professional server
[3272.78 --> 3273.46]  hosting all that kind of
[3273.46 --> 3273.66]  stuff.
[3273.80 --> 3274.20]  Amazing.
[3274.60 --> 3274.72]  Yeah.
[3274.72 --> 3275.42]  Unparalleled.
[3275.60 --> 3277.14]  And actually did we even
[3277.14 --> 3278.36]  talk about part three
[3278.36 --> 3278.94]  of the challenge
[3278.94 --> 3279.68]  where we had to do
[3279.68 --> 3280.54]  mundane tasks
[3280.54 --> 3281.70]  like print a document.
[3281.92 --> 3282.56]  I don't think we have.
[3282.60 --> 3283.14]  Did we talk about it
[3283.14 --> 3283.54]  last week.
[3283.62 --> 3284.38]  Guys let us let me know
[3284.38 --> 3285.18]  in the float plane chat
[3285.18 --> 3286.18]  if we talked about that
[3286.18 --> 3286.66]  last week.
[3286.86 --> 3286.96]  Yeah.
[3287.68 --> 3289.38]  But yeah the I feel like
[3289.38 --> 3290.16]  the other end of the
[3290.16 --> 3291.70]  spectrum from the like
[3291.70 --> 3293.16]  crazy high level stuff
[3293.16 --> 3294.06]  that it's really good at.
[3294.26 --> 3294.40]  Yeah.
[3294.44 --> 3296.02]  I think the really basic
[3296.02 --> 3297.22]  stuff it's also quite good
[3297.22 --> 3297.36]  at.
[3297.62 --> 3297.78]  Yeah.
[3298.00 --> 3299.84]  So I've seen a lot
[3299.84 --> 3301.74]  of criticism of the
[3301.74 --> 3302.82]  challenge from people
[3302.82 --> 3304.00]  that are saying Linux
[3304.00 --> 3305.18]  this is totally fine
[3305.18 --> 3307.16]  for the average user
[3307.16 --> 3308.16]  because all they need
[3308.16 --> 3310.36]  to do is check their
[3310.36 --> 3312.38]  email and like edit a
[3312.38 --> 3313.14]  spreadsheet once in a
[3313.14 --> 3313.40]  while.
[3314.36 --> 3316.78]  And it's like yes
[3316.78 --> 3318.02]  but it was always a
[3318.02 --> 3318.70]  gaming perspective.
[3319.06 --> 3319.18]  Yeah.
[3319.42 --> 3321.46]  It was never my gran
[3321.46 --> 3322.62]  perspective because
[3322.62 --> 3323.08]  you're right.
[3323.54 --> 3324.90]  My gran totally could
[3324.90 --> 3325.70]  use Linux.
[3326.84 --> 3326.92]  Yeah.
[3326.92 --> 3328.54]  So all I ever use my
[3328.54 --> 3331.92]  laptop for is like
[3331.92 --> 3333.70]  Teams which I've kind of
[3333.70 --> 3334.46]  figured out at this point
[3334.46 --> 3335.00]  it's not a problem
[3335.00 --> 3335.28]  anymore.
[3335.98 --> 3338.88]  Slack and web
[3338.88 --> 3339.14]  browser.
[3340.62 --> 3341.82]  So it's totally fine.
[3342.42 --> 3342.66]  Yeah.
[3342.90 --> 3344.14]  And I'm genuinely
[3344.14 --> 3345.34]  finding at this point in
[3345.34 --> 3348.84]  time that I'm getting
[3348.84 --> 3350.02]  more in because my
[3350.02 --> 3351.26]  whole argument and the
[3351.26 --> 3352.28]  reason why I abandoned
[3352.28 --> 3353.42]  Linux last time that I
[3353.42 --> 3354.60]  abandoned it because I
[3354.60 --> 3355.70]  tried Linux I think
[3355.70 --> 3357.46]  four years ago.
[3357.58 --> 3357.78]  Yeah.
[3357.78 --> 3360.12]  and I tried it for a
[3360.12 --> 3360.92]  little bit and then I
[3360.92 --> 3361.64]  was really frustrated
[3361.64 --> 3362.66]  because it kept getting
[3362.66 --> 3364.24]  in my way of just
[3364.24 --> 3365.32]  working because all I
[3365.32 --> 3365.88]  wanted to do was turn
[3365.88 --> 3367.14]  the computer on work and
[3367.14 --> 3367.66]  turn it off.
[3367.78 --> 3369.74]  But like we used the
[3369.74 --> 3370.60]  example that I've given
[3370.60 --> 3372.34]  in the past on Wancho I
[3372.34 --> 3373.36]  believe was that
[3373.36 --> 3374.70]  updating Discord was like
[3374.70 --> 3375.16]  a chore.
[3375.48 --> 3376.92]  But I used Discord at
[3376.92 --> 3377.80]  that point in time for
[3377.80 --> 3379.04]  Floatplane so I needed it.
[3379.16 --> 3379.30]  Right.
[3379.42 --> 3380.14]  And it was it was
[3380.14 --> 3381.08]  annoying to update it.
[3381.18 --> 3382.40]  Now Discord's super easy
[3382.40 --> 3382.72]  to use Linux.
[3382.72 --> 3383.24]  Super easy.
[3383.24 --> 3384.42]  And people brought that
[3384.42 --> 3385.30]  up before I had
[3385.30 --> 3386.96]  installed Linux at all.
[3387.14 --> 3387.74]  So I installed Linux
[3387.74 --> 3388.54]  this time and yeah
[3388.54 --> 3389.56]  updating Discord's easy.
[3389.88 --> 3390.90]  Updating Slack is easy.
[3391.04 --> 3391.90]  Updating Teams is easy.
[3392.68 --> 3393.60]  Updating your browser is
[3393.60 --> 3393.76]  easy.
[3393.86 --> 3394.54]  All the things that I
[3394.54 --> 3395.36]  need to do for work
[3395.36 --> 3396.62]  honestly at this point
[3396.62 --> 3397.98]  in time Linux is
[3397.98 --> 3399.16]  getting in my way less
[3399.16 --> 3399.80]  than Windows.
[3401.40 --> 3402.46]  I believe it would be
[3402.46 --> 3403.22]  easier to use.
[3403.58 --> 3404.78]  So I'm trying to go in
[3404.78 --> 3405.56]  that direction because if
[3405.56 --> 3406.40]  that was my argument in
[3406.40 --> 3408.18]  the past now Windows is
[3408.18 --> 3409.46]  losing so I should be
[3409.46 --> 3410.44]  using Linux on my work
[3410.44 --> 3410.76]  computer.
[3411.18 --> 3412.18]  So I am.
[3412.18 --> 3414.24]  Greg Yo says Linux is
[3414.24 --> 3415.36]  amazing for gaming.
[3416.06 --> 3416.26]  Period.
[3416.96 --> 3418.06]  I'm baffled about the
[3418.06 --> 3419.08]  hardships you have had.
[3419.64 --> 3420.90]  Maybe using an AMD GPU
[3420.90 --> 3421.58]  would help you just a
[3421.58 --> 3421.66]  little.
[3421.76 --> 3423.24]  I've seen a ton of
[3423.24 --> 3424.28]  comments suggesting that
[3424.28 --> 3425.56]  our problem is our GPU.
[3425.88 --> 3427.62]  That is not the problem.
[3427.62 --> 3428.18]  I don't think I've ran
[3428.18 --> 3429.26]  into any issues that are
[3429.26 --> 3429.76]  related to GPU.
[3429.76 --> 3429.96]  No.
[3430.52 --> 3432.18]  The GPU experience has
[3432.18 --> 3433.40]  honestly after all the
[3433.40 --> 3434.44]  warnings that I got other
[3434.44 --> 3435.58]  than navigating through
[3435.58 --> 3437.22]  their driver which is
[3437.22 --> 3438.28]  terrible like the
[3438.28 --> 3439.10]  control panel.
[3439.10 --> 3439.22]  Oh the software.
[3439.50 --> 3439.60]  Yeah.
[3439.60 --> 3440.36]  Yeah the control panel is
[3440.36 --> 3440.60]  terrible.
[3440.92 --> 3442.08]  But in terms of just
[3442.08 --> 3444.66]  like playing games the
[3444.66 --> 3446.04]  GPU driver has been the
[3446.04 --> 3447.96]  least problematic part of
[3447.96 --> 3448.22]  any of it.
[3448.22 --> 3449.16]  We did run into some
[3449.16 --> 3450.22]  performance issues in
[3450.22 --> 3452.96]  Anno and maybe but that
[3452.96 --> 3453.72]  wasn't a big deal.
[3453.86 --> 3454.62]  Yeah that also might have
[3454.62 --> 3456.00]  been my fault for
[3456.00 --> 3457.86]  installing Uplay using
[3457.86 --> 3459.54]  Lutris and then
[3459.54 --> 3461.04]  downloading Anno instead
[3461.04 --> 3462.56]  of installing Anno using
[3462.56 --> 3463.00]  Lutris.
[3463.20 --> 3464.02]  But that's the kind of
[3464.02 --> 3464.86]  stuff I'm talking about
[3464.86 --> 3466.26]  where it's like no this is
[3466.26 --> 3468.04]  actually not intuitive and
[3468.04 --> 3469.40]  not user friendly.
[3469.40 --> 3471.40]  We should talk about the
[3471.40 --> 3473.64]  apparently we did not talk
[3473.64 --> 3474.62]  about part three so we've
[3474.62 --> 3475.60]  filmed part three already.
[3475.60 --> 3475.88]  Yeah.
[3476.24 --> 3477.60]  Guys there's some people
[3477.60 --> 3479.08]  asking like where the heck
[3479.08 --> 3480.16]  are these freaking videos.
[3480.66 --> 3481.84]  So part one has been
[3481.84 --> 3483.36]  delayed to YouTube because
[3483.36 --> 3485.00]  we've had embargoed
[3485.00 --> 3485.34]  releases.
[3485.98 --> 3487.80]  Time sensitive videos that
[3487.80 --> 3489.06]  have kept bumping it and
[3489.06 --> 3489.68]  bumping it and bumping it
[3489.68 --> 3490.48]  because the Linux challenge
[3490.48 --> 3492.60]  is not I understand it's
[3492.60 --> 3493.60]  time sensitive from your
[3493.60 --> 3494.46]  perspective you want to
[3494.46 --> 3495.74]  watch it but it's not
[3495.74 --> 3498.12]  time sensitive from a oh my
[3498.12 --> 3499.60]  goodness this product
[3499.60 --> 3500.52]  launches today.
[3501.00 --> 3501.88]  If we don't cover it
[3501.88 --> 3503.86]  today no one will care
[3503.86 --> 3505.34]  about it tomorrow we must
[3505.34 --> 3505.92]  launch this video.
[3506.12 --> 3508.12]  So we so we've been
[3508.12 --> 3508.86]  pushing it pushing it
[3508.86 --> 3509.52]  pushing and pushing it
[3509.52 --> 3510.82]  and then part two has been
[3510.82 --> 3511.96]  delayed by the absolute
[3511.96 --> 3514.34]  cluster hump of footage
[3514.34 --> 3515.38]  that I provided to the
[3515.38 --> 3515.74]  editors.
[3516.54 --> 3518.98]  My screen cap is like kind
[3518.98 --> 3520.66]  of tied to my doc of just
[3520.66 --> 3522.20]  general notes but then my
[3522.20 --> 3523.16]  scripts while they are
[3523.16 --> 3524.34]  derived from my doc of
[3524.34 --> 3525.48]  general notes also have
[3525.48 --> 3526.50]  other thoughts that I've
[3526.50 --> 3527.48]  added after the fact.
[3527.48 --> 3527.72]  Yeah.
[3527.88 --> 3528.78]  So putting together the
[3528.78 --> 3529.78]  exact moment of screen
[3529.78 --> 3530.54]  cap that's supposed to
[3530.54 --> 3531.44]  accompany every point that
[3531.44 --> 3532.20]  I make in those is going
[3532.20 --> 3533.00]  to be very challenging
[3533.00 --> 3534.68]  and I would have gone
[3534.68 --> 3535.36]  through and done it for
[3535.36 --> 3536.46]  them but I have been
[3536.46 --> 3538.08]  absolutely slammed.
[3538.28 --> 3539.30]  I have not had any time
[3539.30 --> 3540.04]  to look at it.
[3540.86 --> 3542.48]  Part three is delayed by
[3542.48 --> 3544.76]  part one not being up on
[3544.76 --> 3546.26]  YouTube and part two not
[3546.26 --> 3547.44]  being edited and up on
[3547.44 --> 3548.20]  Floatplane but it is
[3548.20 --> 3548.64]  shot.
[3548.82 --> 3550.08]  Luke and I have done all
[3550.08 --> 3551.44]  of the work for it and
[3551.44 --> 3553.00]  what was I mean I think
[3553.00 --> 3554.04]  we can we can definitely
[3554.04 --> 3555.52]  tease part of it but part
[3555.52 --> 3557.20]  three we decided to pivot
[3557.20 --> 3558.20]  part three was supposed
[3558.20 --> 3559.78]  to be game launchers but
[3559.78 --> 3561.70]  because I just have not
[3561.70 --> 3563.48]  kept up with getting all
[3563.48 --> 3564.28]  the game launchers
[3564.28 --> 3565.08]  installed I was like hey
[3565.08 --> 3566.08]  Luke can we make part
[3566.08 --> 3567.40]  four part three and he
[3567.40 --> 3570.30]  was like yeah pretty much
[3570.30 --> 3571.56]  yeah I don't care.
[3572.44 --> 3573.72]  So part three ended up
[3573.72 --> 3576.12]  being non-gaming so
[3576.12 --> 3577.94]  James created a series of
[3577.94 --> 3579.32]  challenges for us and how
[3579.32 --> 3579.84]  did you do?
[3580.54 --> 3582.40]  It was uh don't give them
[3582.40 --> 3583.98]  the exact like score or
[3583.98 --> 3585.78]  anything but like how do
[3585.78 --> 3587.58]  you feel about non-gaming
[3587.58 --> 3588.14]  on Linux?
[3588.34 --> 3589.70]  I was pretty confident
[3589.70 --> 3592.14]  going into it um but I
[3592.14 --> 3594.08]  I like I was pretty
[3594.08 --> 3595.14]  confident before I knew
[3595.14 --> 3596.18]  what the tasks were but I
[3596.18 --> 3596.80]  was a little bit
[3596.80 --> 3597.22]  concerned.
[3597.64 --> 3599.32]  I like pre-downloaded a
[3599.32 --> 3600.32]  few programs just
[3600.32 --> 3601.30]  expecting some things
[3601.30 --> 3602.08]  because we had time
[3602.08 --> 3602.84]  limits for each one of
[3602.84 --> 3603.32]  the tasks.
[3603.54 --> 3603.66]  Yeah.
[3603.74 --> 3604.60]  And I didn't want like
[3604.60 --> 3605.84]  downloading things to
[3605.84 --> 3606.74]  affect me heavily.
[3607.14 --> 3607.38]  Right.
[3607.50 --> 3608.40]  And I knew like I could
[3608.40 --> 3609.80]  probably argue like let's
[3609.80 --> 3610.88]  just not worry about the
[3610.88 --> 3611.70]  amount of time it took to
[3611.70 --> 3612.88]  download the thing because
[3612.88 --> 3613.52]  that's going to be the
[3613.52 --> 3615.08]  same on pretty much
[3615.08 --> 3616.08]  everything but I just
[3616.08 --> 3617.04]  didn't want to even think
[3617.04 --> 3617.42]  about it.
[3618.12 --> 3619.80]  Um so I like pre-downloaded
[3619.80 --> 3621.78]  like GIMP which is a photo
[3621.78 --> 3623.46]  editing software and like a
[3623.46 --> 3624.30]  couple things that I was
[3624.30 --> 3625.96]  like you know what editing a
[3625.96 --> 3626.82]  photo is probably a pretty
[3626.82 --> 3627.96]  standard task let's make
[3627.96 --> 3629.18]  sure I have the stuff to do
[3629.18 --> 3630.48]  that and like just do a
[3630.48 --> 3631.56]  couple things as long as I
[3631.56 --> 3632.90]  could get them if I remember
[3632.90 --> 3634.18]  correctly my my rule for
[3634.18 --> 3635.14]  that was that it was getting
[3635.14 --> 3636.06]  it from the package manager.
[3636.66 --> 3638.44]  So if it was brain dead easy
[3638.44 --> 3640.32]  to find it and get it then
[3640.32 --> 3641.52]  I like let myself get it
[3641.52 --> 3642.60]  before I read what the
[3642.60 --> 3643.08]  tasks were.
[3643.72 --> 3645.04]  And then I read the tasks at
[3645.04 --> 3646.26]  which point I was not doing
[3646.26 --> 3647.98]  anything until the event
[3647.98 --> 3649.22]  started and I was like sweet.
[3650.04 --> 3650.76]  You're ready to rock.
[3650.80 --> 3652.08]  This is gonna be really easy.
[3652.16 --> 3653.46]  I didn't even need anything
[3653.46 --> 3654.42]  that I pre-downloaded.
[3654.64 --> 3656.40]  The like the one thing that
[3656.40 --> 3658.46]  I told you on the call I had
[3658.46 --> 3659.22]  to get that during the
[3659.22 --> 3659.88]  challenge because I didn't
[3659.88 --> 3660.50]  pre-download that.
[3660.56 --> 3660.84]  Yeah.
[3661.00 --> 3662.62]  Um so like because that
[3662.62 --> 3663.58]  wasn't in the package manager.
[3663.86 --> 3665.70]  So yeah and it ended up being
[3665.70 --> 3666.94]  incredibly easy to the point
[3666.94 --> 3668.72]  where certain tasks there
[3668.72 --> 3670.48]  one very much in particular
[3670.48 --> 3671.28]  and you probably know what
[3671.28 --> 3672.82]  what I'm talking about was
[3672.82 --> 3675.40]  genuinely notably easier I
[3675.40 --> 3677.02]  would argue on Linux than it
[3677.02 --> 3678.74]  than I've had experiences
[3678.74 --> 3679.78]  doing those types of things
[3679.78 --> 3680.02]  in the past.
[3680.02 --> 3681.10]  We can spoil that one.
[3681.18 --> 3682.02]  I think you're talking about
[3682.02 --> 3682.36]  printing.
[3682.52 --> 3682.78]  Yes.
[3683.12 --> 3685.94]  So my ancient printer there's
[3685.94 --> 3687.86]  only one place it's like some
[3687.86 --> 3689.62]  weird third-party driver
[3689.62 --> 3691.20]  repository that still has
[3691.20 --> 3692.28]  drivers for it.
[3692.28 --> 3695.58]  It's a CLP 310 or something.
[3695.68 --> 3696.58]  Maybe you'll find another
[3696.58 --> 3697.64]  place for the drivers.
[3697.76 --> 3698.38]  Don't send it to me.
[3698.42 --> 3698.82]  I don't care.
[3698.92 --> 3700.42]  I have it stored on my NAS now
[3700.42 --> 3703.38]  and it's like this whole
[3703.38 --> 3705.24]  it's this it's this MSI that
[3705.24 --> 3706.72]  you have to extract to actually
[3706.72 --> 3708.70]  grab the the stupid what are
[3708.70 --> 3709.16]  they dot.
[3710.14 --> 3711.22]  I don't remember what the
[3711.22 --> 3712.90]  extension of the file type is
[3712.90 --> 3713.56]  dot INI.
[3713.72 --> 3714.36]  Is it is that it?
[3714.44 --> 3714.72]  I don't know.
[3714.76 --> 3715.34]  It doesn't matter.
[3715.42 --> 3716.72]  The point is to find the
[3716.72 --> 3718.02]  actual like driver file and
[3718.02 --> 3718.60]  then you have to go through
[3718.60 --> 3719.78]  and manually add the printer
[3719.78 --> 3721.28]  pointed at the specific file
[3721.28 --> 3723.42]  and then it'll it'll load and
[3723.42 --> 3724.42]  it works perfectly.
[3724.66 --> 3726.16]  Everything is fine because
[3726.16 --> 3727.36]  even though it's a Windows
[3727.36 --> 3730.12]  7 driver I think it's a
[3730.12 --> 3730.78]  super old printer.
[3730.94 --> 3731.76]  So even though it's a Windows
[3731.76 --> 3734.36]  7 driver Microsoft has
[3734.36 --> 3735.46]  actually done an outstanding
[3735.46 --> 3737.52]  job of maintaining driver
[3737.52 --> 3739.70]  compatibility from Microsoft
[3739.70 --> 3740.96]  Windows Vista really.
[3741.48 --> 3742.52]  You can sometimes use Vista
[3742.52 --> 3744.10]  drivers on like Windows 10
[3744.10 --> 3745.58]  and you'll get away with it.
[3746.84 --> 3748.60]  Not not every time to be very
[3748.60 --> 3748.90]  clear.
[3748.90 --> 3750.62]  So it works perfectly if you
[3750.62 --> 3751.46]  can figure out how to install
[3751.46 --> 3752.48]  the freaking thing on Linux.
[3753.30 --> 3755.94]  I was like, oh, how hard is
[3755.94 --> 3756.90]  this going to be because this
[3756.90 --> 3758.66]  ancient printer add network
[3758.66 --> 3759.08]  printer.
[3759.20 --> 3760.62]  It was like that.
[3760.74 --> 3761.36]  You mean this one?
[3761.42 --> 3763.14]  I was like, yes.
[3763.52 --> 3765.78]  And it was like, okay.
[3767.06 --> 3767.50]  Yeah.
[3767.88 --> 3770.20]  But mine like my girlfriend has
[3770.20 --> 3770.60]  a printer.
[3771.42 --> 3773.12]  I have not had a printer.
[3773.12 --> 3774.22]  I think ever.
[3774.40 --> 3775.58]  I've just always used like
[3775.58 --> 3776.86]  other people's, my parents,
[3776.98 --> 3777.20]  whatever.
[3778.38 --> 3779.76]  And and every once in a while
[3779.76 --> 3780.94]  when the printer turns on,
[3781.00 --> 3782.38]  I'll just get a little like
[3782.38 --> 3783.48]  system notification that's
[3783.48 --> 3784.74]  like that printer connected.
[3785.50 --> 3787.60]  So leading up until this task,
[3787.60 --> 3788.56]  I've just been like, I wonder
[3788.56 --> 3789.16]  if that works.
[3789.18 --> 3790.34]  I just have no reason to print
[3790.34 --> 3791.20]  anything ever.
[3791.20 --> 3792.20]  Like I haven't had to print
[3792.20 --> 3792.98]  something in years.
[3793.56 --> 3793.64]  Yeah.
[3793.80 --> 3794.52]  Jamal Taylor.
[3795.00 --> 3796.00]  That's what happened.
[3796.08 --> 3796.56]  That's right.
[3796.70 --> 3797.86]  Samsung sold their printer
[3797.86 --> 3799.66]  division to HP who gave
[3799.66 --> 3802.24]  exactly zero flying Fs about
[3802.24 --> 3803.80]  properly supporting the old
[3803.80 --> 3805.24]  Samsung versions of the
[3805.24 --> 3805.58]  printers.
[3805.88 --> 3807.52]  That's why I can't just go on
[3807.52 --> 3808.64]  Samsung's website and
[3808.64 --> 3809.70]  download the driver package
[3809.70 --> 3810.24]  for it anymore.
[3810.34 --> 3811.58]  And I remember now.
[3811.58 --> 3811.90]  Gotcha.
[3812.62 --> 3813.88]  There you go.
[3813.98 --> 3815.82]  But yeah, printing like the
[3815.82 --> 3817.26]  one of the most like
[3817.26 --> 3818.62]  stereotypical things that's
[3818.62 --> 3819.78]  annoying to do on Windows.
[3820.56 --> 3820.88]  Yes.
[3820.92 --> 3822.04]  Like attaching printers was
[3822.04 --> 3823.62]  just the easiest thing ever.
[3823.94 --> 3825.04]  And we've been saying for
[3825.04 --> 3826.40]  years like this should be so
[3826.40 --> 3826.60]  much.
[3826.60 --> 3827.30]  How is printing so broken?
[3827.60 --> 3827.98]  And then.
[3828.24 --> 3828.92]  It turns out it's
[3828.92 --> 3829.64]  Microsoft's fault.
[3829.80 --> 3830.02]  Yeah.
[3831.00 --> 3831.82]  Good to know.
[3831.94 --> 3832.34]  Nice.
[3832.48 --> 3832.68]  Yeah.
[3832.82 --> 3832.98]  Yeah.
[3832.98 --> 3833.70]  Thanks for that.
[3833.84 --> 3835.00]  Thanks for clearing all of
[3835.00 --> 3835.68]  that up for me.
[3835.74 --> 3836.26]  Real good.
[3836.80 --> 3837.54]  It's ridiculous.
[3838.04 --> 3839.06]  So that's going to be an
[3839.06 --> 3839.74]  interesting one.
[3839.86 --> 3840.36]  We've got us.
[3840.46 --> 3841.80]  I think it's 12 challenges
[3841.80 --> 3843.12]  that we have to go through
[3843.12 --> 3844.56]  and then we have a time limit
[3844.56 --> 3846.08]  that is allotted to each
[3846.08 --> 3846.32]  challenge.
[3846.38 --> 3847.46]  You may not spend longer
[3847.46 --> 3848.32]  than 15 minutes.
[3848.80 --> 3851.52]  And I did run into one
[3851.52 --> 3853.50]  kind of Linux,
[3853.64 --> 3854.62]  Linux ism.
[3854.84 --> 3856.34]  There was something that is
[3856.34 --> 3857.64]  very simple to do.
[3857.82 --> 3859.04]  If you happen to know the
[3859.04 --> 3859.96]  utility to use.
[3860.36 --> 3862.00]  So Luke blew right through
[3862.00 --> 3862.22]  it.
[3862.38 --> 3862.90]  Oh.
[3863.08 --> 3865.28]  And I was not able to
[3865.28 --> 3865.80]  complete it.
[3865.80 --> 3866.24]  Mine was luck.
[3866.32 --> 3867.26]  Within my 15 minutes.
[3867.38 --> 3868.56]  Now I could have done it.
[3869.00 --> 3871.30]  I could have done it if I had
[3871.30 --> 3875.04]  like two hours to dedicate to
[3875.04 --> 3875.20]  it.
[3875.46 --> 3877.32]  To finally find a guide.
[3877.32 --> 3878.90]  But you guys are going to see,
[3879.10 --> 3880.50]  especially in a time
[3880.50 --> 3882.28]  constrained environment,
[3882.28 --> 3884.50]  which can happen without the
[3884.50 --> 3886.20]  artificial 15 minute timer.
[3886.40 --> 3888.04]  But if you don't have all the
[3888.04 --> 3889.38]  time in the world to figure out
[3889.38 --> 3890.80]  how to do a basic freaking
[3890.80 --> 3893.32]  thing, it can be an extremely
[3893.32 --> 3894.48]  frustrating experience.
[3894.86 --> 3897.30]  And that particular one
[3897.30 --> 3900.26]  ended up not being simple.
[3900.26 --> 3902.90]  When you see how not simple
[3902.90 --> 3905.26]  mine was, it'll blow your mind.
[3905.32 --> 3907.12]  You'll be like, how is this not
[3907.12 --> 3908.10]  one button?
[3908.32 --> 3909.52]  How is this not completely
[3909.52 --> 3911.28]  automatic like it was for
[3911.28 --> 3911.64]  yours?
[3911.74 --> 3913.36]  And like, I just tried to
[3913.36 --> 3913.80]  Google it.
[3914.58 --> 3915.92]  Like, what would I do?
[3916.00 --> 3917.14]  Because the first thing that I
[3917.14 --> 3918.02]  sorry, I was scratching my
[3918.02 --> 3918.14]  leg.
[3918.36 --> 3921.02]  The first thing that I did was
[3921.02 --> 3922.44]  just Google the exact name of
[3922.44 --> 3923.46]  the program that I like using
[3923.46 --> 3924.42]  on Windows.
[3925.46 --> 3928.38]  And then the word Linux after
[3928.38 --> 3928.62]  it.
[3928.82 --> 3929.02]  Yeah.
[3929.12 --> 3930.44]  And just lo and behold, it
[3930.44 --> 3931.44]  happens to have a Linux version.
[3931.54 --> 3932.58]  So that was very lucky.
[3933.22 --> 3935.02]  But I just tried Googling the
[3935.02 --> 3937.80]  term I would have used if I had
[3937.80 --> 3938.86]  no knowledge of that program in
[3938.86 --> 3939.20]  the past.
[3939.30 --> 3940.20]  It did not come up.
[3940.62 --> 3940.78]  Yeah.
[3941.02 --> 3942.64]  So I didn't Google anything
[3942.64 --> 3943.98]  because I already had an
[3943.98 --> 3945.74]  application pre-installed as part
[3945.74 --> 3947.02]  of my distro or desktop
[3947.02 --> 3948.52]  environment, whatever determines
[3948.52 --> 3950.24]  which application I got.
[3950.24 --> 3950.48]  Sure.
[3951.16 --> 3953.86]  That supported that file
[3953.86 --> 3956.76]  format and supported that
[3956.76 --> 3957.48]  functionality.
[3958.10 --> 3958.54]  Right.
[3958.88 --> 3961.78]  But required me to go and
[3961.78 --> 3964.48]  create like a certificate in
[3964.48 --> 3965.38]  order to do it.
[3965.38 --> 3967.96]  and the guide for how to do that
[3967.96 --> 3970.04]  was like really focused on like
[3970.04 --> 3972.34]  more like web developers as
[3972.34 --> 3973.48]  opposed to what I was trying to
[3973.48 --> 3973.72]  do.
[3974.22 --> 3975.26]  And that's the thing about
[3975.26 --> 3975.62]  Google.
[3976.00 --> 3978.48]  Google search is amazing if you
[3978.48 --> 3981.04]  happen to be looking for the
[3981.04 --> 3982.46]  answer that everyone else who
[3982.46 --> 3983.90]  used those keywords was looking
[3983.90 --> 3984.22]  for.
[3984.64 --> 3986.20]  But as soon as you've got a
[3986.20 --> 3988.70]  keyword that sounds like
[3988.70 --> 3990.18]  something but is actually
[3990.18 --> 3993.44]  something else, you are done.
[3993.44 --> 3995.04]  I've actually run into situations
[3995.04 --> 3997.28]  where I can't even remember what
[3997.28 --> 3997.94]  Microsoft's stupid.
[3998.02 --> 3998.18]  Bing.
[3998.98 --> 4000.56]  I've actually run into situations
[4000.56 --> 4004.04]  where Bing has managed to get me
[4004.04 --> 4005.96]  the result I need that Google
[4005.96 --> 4008.10]  can't provide me because it sucks
[4008.10 --> 4008.64]  so much.
[4009.10 --> 4011.14]  Because it's just like, what are
[4011.14 --> 4011.98]  you looking for?
[4012.18 --> 4014.36]  Oh, here's some random crap.
[4015.64 --> 4016.56]  Thanks, Bing.
[4017.76 --> 4019.38]  This is another example of what I'm
[4019.38 --> 4019.90]  talking about.
[4020.06 --> 4022.62]  The Bitman says, comparing Windows
[4022.62 --> 4024.56]  gaming on Linux isn't super fair
[4024.56 --> 4024.90]  either.
[4025.24 --> 4026.66]  It's more comparable to emulating
[4026.66 --> 4028.84]  other platforms games, eGPS5,
[4028.98 --> 4029.88]  than running native Windows
[4029.88 --> 4030.18]  games.
[4030.74 --> 4032.24]  This is the same kind of argument
[4032.24 --> 4033.44]  that I see when it's like, no,
[4033.44 --> 4033.98]  it's not fair.
[4033.98 --> 4035.98]  It's not fair to run that DDR5 on
[4035.98 --> 4036.34]  that one.
[4036.52 --> 4037.98]  Or it's not fair to turn hyper
[4037.98 --> 4039.16]  threading on an Intel CPU.
[4039.24 --> 4040.38]  That was a thing back in the day.
[4040.56 --> 4041.76]  It's not fair to turn on hyper
[4041.76 --> 4043.28]  threading because AMD CPUs don't
[4043.28 --> 4043.62]  have it.
[4043.68 --> 4045.16]  So you should eliminate variables.
[4045.28 --> 4045.76]  It's like, no.
[4046.58 --> 4046.84]  No.
[4046.92 --> 4048.20]  What we're evaluating is the user
[4048.20 --> 4048.80]  experience.
[4049.04 --> 4051.06]  And users want to play video
[4051.06 --> 4051.32]  games.
[4052.18 --> 4054.58]  And so if your options are install
[4054.58 --> 4056.44]  this or install this and your goal
[4056.44 --> 4058.16]  is play video games, it doesn't
[4058.16 --> 4060.06]  matter from a user standpoint.
[4060.44 --> 4061.44]  User experience.
[4061.66 --> 4062.92]  It doesn't matter if one of them is
[4062.92 --> 4065.22]  emulating or rather not emulating.
[4066.00 --> 4067.46]  It doesn't matter if one of them is
[4067.46 --> 4069.00]  emulating and one of them is running
[4069.00 --> 4069.72]  it natively.
[4071.00 --> 4072.80]  It just matters what the user
[4072.80 --> 4073.56]  experience is.
[4074.50 --> 4075.16]  Nothing else is relevant.
[4075.16 --> 4076.24]  There's also little things.
[4076.44 --> 4076.60]  Yeah.
[4077.16 --> 4078.66]  It's not fair or unfair.
[4078.66 --> 4079.52]  It just is.
[4079.70 --> 4079.88]  Yeah.
[4080.10 --> 4080.50]  Sorry.
[4081.24 --> 4082.00]  It's not fair.
[4082.18 --> 4083.96]  I personally think that and you're
[4083.96 --> 4084.98]  going to run into this type of stuff
[4084.98 --> 4085.54]  on Windows too.
[4085.98 --> 4086.62]  100%.
[4086.62 --> 4086.98]  Okay.
[4087.22 --> 4088.76]  I ran into some really dumb stuff on
[4088.76 --> 4089.28]  Windows today.
[4089.50 --> 4090.28]  I can't remember what it was.
[4090.50 --> 4091.96]  Really dumb stuff on Windows all the
[4091.96 --> 4092.22]  time.
[4092.28 --> 4092.38]  Yeah.
[4092.52 --> 4093.10]  Like we're not.
[4094.56 --> 4095.26]  I remember.
[4095.58 --> 4096.34]  We're not trying to be Windows
[4096.34 --> 4096.68]  crusaders.
[4096.84 --> 4096.94]  What?
[4097.06 --> 4097.26]  Yeah.
[4097.58 --> 4098.86]  So here's a really dumb one.
[4099.18 --> 4100.00]  It opened VPN.
[4100.62 --> 4100.78]  Okay.
[4100.86 --> 4102.42]  So sometimes I'll accidentally leave it
[4102.42 --> 4103.88]  connected and I'll put my computer to
[4103.88 --> 4104.90]  sleep like on my laptop.
[4104.90 --> 4108.74]  If I wake it up and I still have the
[4108.74 --> 4111.82]  folder that I was navigating using my
[4111.82 --> 4115.00]  VPN connection open, no amount of
[4115.00 --> 4116.78]  reconnecting it and reconnecting it
[4116.78 --> 4118.66]  will allow me to, Windows Explorer just
[4118.66 --> 4119.20]  gets confused.
[4119.36 --> 4119.56]  Yeah.
[4119.76 --> 4121.92]  I will not be able to do anything with
[4121.92 --> 4122.26]  that folder.
[4122.36 --> 4123.80]  I have to go restart the, I have to
[4123.80 --> 4125.68]  close open VPN, restart the Explorer
[4125.68 --> 4127.88]  process, open open VPN, connect to it,
[4128.04 --> 4129.96]  then open Explorer, then I'll be able
[4129.96 --> 4130.36]  to navigate.
[4130.36 --> 4133.26]  And it's just like these stupid kinds
[4133.26 --> 4135.68]  of dances, solid mixer.
[4135.86 --> 4138.32]  I disagree that command line is not a
[4138.32 --> 4139.78]  good user experience for a gamer.
[4140.68 --> 4143.36]  There is no disagree that just, you're
[4143.36 --> 4144.70]  just objectively wrong.
[4144.82 --> 4145.34]  I'm sorry.
[4145.84 --> 4147.60]  Thank you for being one of my paid
[4147.60 --> 4148.16]  subscribers.
[4149.12 --> 4152.72]  Love you, but you're actually just
[4152.72 --> 4153.72]  wrong.
[4154.02 --> 4156.30]  There is, there is, there, I should say
[4156.30 --> 4158.36]  there are, there are people that are
[4158.36 --> 4159.88]  willing to take you up on the challenge
[4159.88 --> 4163.34]  of being able to complete operations
[4163.34 --> 4164.72]  faster in a command line than you can
[4164.72 --> 4165.60]  in a, in a GUI.
[4165.92 --> 4166.28]  Really?
[4166.44 --> 4166.78]  Okay.
[4167.04 --> 4169.84]  I think those people, if I could argue,
[4170.04 --> 4170.54]  who are they?
[4171.26 --> 4172.28]  I just, somebody on Twitter.
[4172.40 --> 4172.64]  I don't know.
[4172.64 --> 4173.00]  Oh, okay.
[4173.06 --> 4174.24]  I thought you meant like the one of the
[4174.24 --> 4174.76]  float plane staff.
[4174.78 --> 4175.52]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4175.58 --> 4175.74]  Yeah.
[4176.78 --> 4180.76]  I think those people would be looking
[4180.76 --> 4183.36]  for intentionally loaded situations.
[4183.92 --> 4184.68]  Well, yeah, sure.
[4184.78 --> 4186.58]  I mean, if you have to, if you have to
[4186.58 --> 4188.92]  copy 8,000 files or something like
[4188.92 --> 4189.68]  that, yeah, sure.
[4190.16 --> 4191.68]  I don't even know necessarily, but
[4191.68 --> 4193.26]  like, I think there might be
[4193.26 --> 4194.46]  situations where it is better.
[4194.56 --> 4195.32]  I think overall you're going to do
[4195.32 --> 4197.38]  better using a GUI, but anyways.
[4197.74 --> 4198.34]  Solid mixer.
[4198.52 --> 4199.60]  It's not subjective.
[4200.24 --> 4203.02]  For 99% of the things the typical
[4203.02 --> 4204.26]  gamer would need to do on their
[4204.26 --> 4204.66]  computer.
[4204.76 --> 4206.18]  It is faster to use a GUI.
[4206.52 --> 4207.72]  Because that's, that's part of the
[4207.72 --> 4208.22]  problem, right?
[4208.26 --> 4209.32]  Is, is, is, sorry.
[4209.40 --> 4210.32]  I keep moving away from the mic.
[4210.32 --> 4210.50]  You do.
[4210.76 --> 4212.50]  Uh, that's, that I think part of the
[4212.50 --> 4214.92]  problem is that we're, we're dealing
[4214.92 --> 4216.40]  with terms that some people might be
[4216.40 --> 4217.32]  using in different ways.
[4217.58 --> 4219.36]  So like when he's saying like a
[4219.36 --> 4222.22]  gamer, well, there could be someone
[4222.22 --> 4225.64]  who's like, uh, a, a, a, a DevOps
[4225.64 --> 4229.70]  Linux admin at work and a gamer at
[4229.70 --> 4229.98]  home.
[4230.82 --> 4232.12]  And when they want to do stuff on
[4232.12 --> 4233.74]  their computer, they're so native to
[4233.74 --> 4234.68]  the command line that they're just
[4234.68 --> 4235.66]  going to be able to do it faster.
[4235.82 --> 4236.26]  That's fine.
[4236.78 --> 4237.04]  Right.
[4237.08 --> 4238.26]  But that just means they suck at
[4238.26 --> 4239.10]  using a GUI then.
[4239.24 --> 4239.48]  Sure.
[4239.60 --> 4240.82]  In most situations.
[4240.82 --> 4241.08]  Yeah.
[4241.08 --> 4242.94]  And like a lot of gaming things are
[4242.94 --> 4244.00]  visual anyway.
[4244.18 --> 4245.38]  So like, yeah, you can probably find
[4245.38 --> 4246.62]  a way to, you can definitely start
[4246.62 --> 4247.86]  your games through the command line,
[4247.94 --> 4248.96]  but it's going to be faster.
[4249.10 --> 4251.18]  Like I see a lot of arguments, um,
[4251.18 --> 4253.98]  for installing applications using the
[4253.98 --> 4254.88]  command line on Linux.
[4255.14 --> 4255.84]  Spooky dooky.
[4255.98 --> 4258.02]  But the problem with that is that it
[4258.02 --> 4260.14]  assumes that you already know to the
[4260.14 --> 4262.52]  exact character what the name of the
[4262.52 --> 4263.84]  package you're trying to install is.
[4266.24 --> 4268.02]  Well, you can, you can also query a
[4268.02 --> 4270.04]  list, but I mean, it's still.
[4270.04 --> 4271.16]  That's not faster than the command
[4271.16 --> 4271.54]  line then.
[4271.60 --> 4271.76]  Yeah.
[4271.88 --> 4273.12]  You should use your package manager
[4273.12 --> 4274.32]  or rather you should use your
[4274.32 --> 4275.32]  graphical package manager.
[4275.48 --> 4275.98]  If it's there.
[4276.12 --> 4277.02]  Or you should Google it.
[4277.38 --> 4277.74]  Yeah.
[4278.00 --> 4280.10]  So either way, this is one of those
[4280.10 --> 4282.48]  things where unless you happen to
[4282.48 --> 4284.18]  have that requisite knowledge and I
[4284.18 --> 4286.50]  feel like a lot of people live in a
[4286.50 --> 4287.04]  bit of a bubble.
[4287.38 --> 4287.76]  Oh yeah.
[4287.86 --> 4288.60]  Oh yeah.
[4288.68 --> 4290.54]  There's a lot of, there's a lot of
[4290.54 --> 4291.00]  that going on.
[4291.06 --> 4292.46]  Where they're assuming people have this
[4292.46 --> 4293.20]  requisite knowledge.
[4293.20 --> 4295.08]  When I say gamer, I don't mean you.
[4295.64 --> 4296.42]  You might be a gamer.
[4296.56 --> 4296.68]  Sure.
[4296.72 --> 4297.16]  That's cool.
[4297.46 --> 4298.68]  But you're also a lot of other things.
[4298.76 --> 4299.84]  Maybe you're a father.
[4300.04 --> 4301.16]  Maybe you're a martial artist.
[4301.30 --> 4302.36]  Maybe you're a musician.
[4302.78 --> 4303.14]  Right?
[4303.66 --> 4305.38]  When I say gamer, I'm talking about
[4305.38 --> 4306.48]  gamers in general.
[4306.60 --> 4309.80]  In general, gamers do not want to use
[4309.80 --> 4311.30]  the command line and is not more
[4311.30 --> 4311.66]  efficient.
[4311.92 --> 4312.86]  The core question.
[4313.56 --> 4315.08]  So we talked earlier about how like
[4315.08 --> 4317.42]  the core idea is using Linux for
[4317.42 --> 4317.64]  gaming.
[4317.90 --> 4320.50]  The core question is essentially is
[4320.50 --> 4323.88]  now the year of the Linux desktop.
[4323.88 --> 4326.84]  And one of the prerequisites for that to
[4326.84 --> 4327.36]  be a thing.
[4327.50 --> 4327.72]  Yeah.
[4327.82 --> 4328.48]  Is gaming.
[4328.82 --> 4329.32]  For a lot of people.
[4329.80 --> 4330.38]  For a lot of people.
[4330.38 --> 4330.82]  Not everyone.
[4331.24 --> 4333.22]  For, but I'd say in a lot of
[4333.22 --> 4334.94]  situations it's, it almost doesn't
[4334.94 --> 4337.82]  even matter because like if, if it's a
[4337.82 --> 4338.58]  family computer.
[4338.78 --> 4339.18]  Sure.
[4339.42 --> 4341.18]  If gaming is important for one of the
[4341.18 --> 4341.48]  people.
[4341.68 --> 4342.00]  Yes.
[4342.66 --> 4343.86]  They're going to push that argument
[4343.86 --> 4344.38]  really hard.
[4344.48 --> 4345.78]  There's a lot of forever alones that
[4345.78 --> 4347.52]  don't have a family to share their
[4347.52 --> 4347.82]  computer.
[4348.22 --> 4348.86]  That's true.
[4348.86 --> 4352.22]  They might already be running
[4352.22 --> 4352.50]  Linux.
[4353.32 --> 4355.32]  I can't believe you just did that.
[4355.44 --> 4356.70]  You set me up.
[4356.92 --> 4358.12]  You knew that was coming.
[4358.44 --> 4359.50]  I was so on purpose.
[4359.66 --> 4361.46]  You can't even say you can't believe
[4361.46 --> 4362.22]  I just did that.
[4362.38 --> 4364.24]  When you literally like you threw the
[4364.24 --> 4364.70]  alley-oop.
[4364.82 --> 4366.04]  I can't believe you've done this.
[4366.22 --> 4367.56]  You're like, bro, get it.
[4369.80 --> 4370.24]  Anyways.
[4372.64 --> 4375.30]  It's the, so the idea is, is it time
[4375.30 --> 4375.52]  yet?
[4375.52 --> 4377.22]  And like, while the experience for you
[4377.22 --> 4378.82]  as a gamer, he uses Linux might
[4378.82 --> 4379.32]  be all right.
[4379.62 --> 4381.88]  It's general population doesn't want
[4381.88 --> 4383.50]  to learn command line and it's, it's
[4383.50 --> 4384.06]  not going to change.
[4384.10 --> 4384.74]  It's not going to happen.
[4385.04 --> 4385.18]  Yeah.
[4385.18 --> 4387.76]  That is literally never going to
[4387.76 --> 4388.08]  happen.
[4388.26 --> 4390.20]  I promise you that whole industry is
[4390.20 --> 4391.18]  going the other direction.
[4391.68 --> 4394.38]  Um, so a solid mixer says, Hey,
[4394.40 --> 4394.78]  that's cool.
[4394.82 --> 4395.98]  If we disagree, thanks for doing the
[4395.98 --> 4396.50]  challenge anyway.
[4396.50 --> 4397.36]  It's cool to see you guys trying
[4397.36 --> 4397.52]  it out.
[4397.56 --> 4397.68]  Yeah.
[4397.68 --> 4398.88]  I'm, I'm enjoying it.
[4398.94 --> 4399.66]  I'm having fun.
[4400.02 --> 4400.70]  Great response.
[4400.94 --> 4403.90]  So one landmine thing that we ran
[4403.90 --> 4406.14]  into, um, and this was not pre
[4406.14 --> 4406.58]  planned.
[4406.76 --> 4408.22]  This was not planned before we started
[4408.22 --> 4408.80]  this challenge.
[4408.92 --> 4409.92]  This, I don't even think this was
[4409.92 --> 4411.10]  planned before that night.
[4411.44 --> 4413.98]  Um, but we wanted to play Supreme
[4413.98 --> 4415.12]  Commander Forge Alliance forever.
[4415.92 --> 4417.16]  We wanted to play it because we
[4417.16 --> 4417.68]  played on windows.
[4417.80 --> 4418.30]  It's a fun game.
[4418.52 --> 4419.14]  You should try it.
[4419.62 --> 4422.88]  Um, we also had some amount of
[4422.88 --> 4424.52]  information, which was that Linus
[4424.52 --> 4426.86]  had looked it up and there was an
[4426.86 --> 4429.38]  official guide from the community
[4429.38 --> 4431.46]  official from community, whatever.
[4431.62 --> 4431.78]  Yeah.
[4431.90 --> 4433.64]  Um, to get Forge Alliance forever
[4433.64 --> 4434.66]  working on Linux.
[4434.66 --> 4437.30]  So going into this project, we
[4437.30 --> 4438.10]  know there's a game that we want
[4438.10 --> 4441.58]  to play and we know that it works
[4441.58 --> 4442.48]  on Linux, right?
[4442.58 --> 4442.74]  Yeah.
[4444.64 --> 4446.16]  This is one of those problems where
[4446.16 --> 4447.26]  like the argument was brought up
[4447.26 --> 4447.66]  earlier.
[4447.66 --> 4448.60]  And the thing that I was actually
[4448.60 --> 4449.74]  trying to refer this to is a little
[4449.74 --> 4451.86]  in the past now, but the argument
[4451.86 --> 4454.16]  came up that like, uh, well you're
[4454.16 --> 4456.30]  just playing games that like aren't
[4456.30 --> 4457.52]  really compatible with Linux or no
[4457.52 --> 4459.32]  one's figured out the compatibility
[4459.32 --> 4460.54]  layer stuff or whatever else.
[4460.88 --> 4462.52]  It's like, okay, in this situation,
[4462.60 --> 4464.68]  we actually tried to find a game
[4464.68 --> 4465.78]  that people had already figured out
[4465.78 --> 4466.52]  all the stuff for.
[4466.82 --> 4469.72]  And lo and behold, you can get it
[4469.72 --> 4472.88]  to run, but the guide is super,
[4472.88 --> 4474.58]  super, super out of date to the
[4474.58 --> 4476.04]  point where there's packages that
[4476.04 --> 4477.22]  it's telling you to download that
[4477.22 --> 4478.54]  are not in those repositories
[4478.54 --> 4478.94]  anymore.
[4479.24 --> 4480.90]  So you actually can't get them.
[4481.48 --> 4484.22]  Uh, you have to, you have to find
[4484.22 --> 4485.38]  a different way to get them.
[4485.60 --> 4487.10]  And that different way to get them
[4487.10 --> 4488.72]  is extremely unintuitive.
[4489.02 --> 4491.60]  Um, to the point where there was
[4491.60 --> 4494.22]  people suggesting ways for us to get
[4494.22 --> 4497.48]  it that were like self-proclaimed
[4497.66 --> 4498.92]  Linux nerds and experts.
[4499.40 --> 4500.56]  And those ways were wrong.
[4500.90 --> 4501.32]  Yes.
[4501.74 --> 4502.76]  Which is fine.
[4503.48 --> 4505.46]  Like I'm not blaming them, but like,
[4505.52 --> 4506.86]  all I'm saying is it was very
[4506.86 --> 4508.94]  unintuitive and it was difficult to do.
[4509.18 --> 4511.94]  And that's a bad experience compared
[4511.94 --> 4515.80]  to the alternative experience on
[4515.80 --> 4518.80]  windows where you download the exe
[4518.80 --> 4521.40]  file, you install it, you log in.
[4522.50 --> 4525.14]  So I will usually they work very hard.
[4525.14 --> 4526.22]  Sometimes they have some downtime.
[4526.46 --> 4528.20]  Um, they're great community.
[4528.74 --> 4530.64]  Uh, I actually posted in the discord.
[4530.64 --> 4531.70]  That's what I was trying to pull up
[4531.70 --> 4533.74]  my post, uh, just as a user, I just
[4533.74 --> 4535.58]  posted in the technical help discord.
[4535.58 --> 4537.20]  I did use my username, but a lot of
[4537.20 --> 4538.24]  the people there don't know who the heck
[4538.24 --> 4538.56]  I am.
[4539.00 --> 4541.30]  And I was like, Hey, so, um, running on
[4541.30 --> 4544.00]  Linux is that like, uh, this guide, I
[4544.24 --> 4545.36]  had a hard time following this guide
[4545.36 --> 4548.06]  and they were like, Ooh, that guide.
[4548.18 --> 4549.46]  Uh, yeah.
[4549.46 --> 4550.68]  There's really no excuse for this.
[4550.68 --> 4552.98]  Given that like some of the really
[4552.98 --> 4554.32]  prominent members of the community
[4554.32 --> 4556.68]  actually daily drive Linux and game
[4556.68 --> 4559.24]  exclusively in forge Alliance forever on
[4559.24 --> 4559.72]  Linux.
[4560.08 --> 4562.78]  They were just like, yeah.
[4562.86 --> 4563.14]  Okay.
[4563.14 --> 4563.36]  Here.
[4563.36 --> 4563.50]  Yeah.
[4563.50 --> 4564.24]  I found my post.
[4564.54 --> 4566.24]  Anyone want to update the how to
[4566.24 --> 4567.92]  install FAF on Linux doc?
[4567.94 --> 4569.16]  I haven't been able to play for three
[4569.16 --> 4569.52]  weeks.
[4569.54 --> 4570.06]  Lol.
[4570.06 --> 4573.16]  And, uh, they're like, which doc are
[4573.16 --> 4573.72]  you using?
[4574.12 --> 4576.54]  Um, I post the wiki, their own wiki.
[4576.88 --> 4579.26]  And I'm like, Java is kicking my ass.
[4579.52 --> 4581.14]  They're like, no, someone else pops in.
[4581.22 --> 4581.34]  Yeah.
[4581.34 --> 4581.94]  That's out of date.
[4582.10 --> 4583.14]  Use this forum thread.
[4583.30 --> 4584.76]  I believe there's a Lutra script.
[4585.46 --> 4587.32]  Um, I don't think so.
[4587.42 --> 4591.38]  Their wiki didn't have the Lutra script.
[4591.44 --> 4591.62]  Also.
[4591.62 --> 4592.92]  I think I tried the Lutra script.
[4593.06 --> 4594.42]  I haven't tried it since they suggested
[4594.42 --> 4594.58]  it.
[4594.60 --> 4595.72]  So maybe it's been updated or something,
[4595.72 --> 4597.62]  but I thought we tried the Lutra script as
[4597.62 --> 4598.34]  part of the process.
[4598.34 --> 4599.58]  And I think it was out of date as well.
[4599.58 --> 4600.86]  Remember there being something not good with
[4600.86 --> 4601.32]  Lutra script.
[4601.32 --> 4602.50]  There was some kind of problem.
[4602.64 --> 4604.36]  And that's, yes, that's community thing.
[4604.52 --> 4604.80]  Blah, blah, blah.
[4604.96 --> 4607.30]  But one of the problems with the Linux setup,
[4607.42 --> 4608.48]  having tons of different distros,
[4608.56 --> 4609.74]  having tons of different DEs,
[4609.82 --> 4611.16]  having a lot of community base,
[4611.16 --> 4614.78]  is you always have a circular loop of
[4614.78 --> 4616.02]  excuses that you can go through.
[4616.02 --> 4616.84]  Yeah.
[4616.84 --> 4618.50]  And none of it matters.
[4619.20 --> 4619.84]  User experience.
[4620.66 --> 4620.86]  Yes.
[4620.98 --> 4621.34]  Two words.
[4621.50 --> 4621.66]  Yep.
[4621.72 --> 4622.14]  That's it.
[4622.34 --> 4622.50]  Yep.
[4623.08 --> 4625.36]  Um, so the user experience,
[4625.66 --> 4627.22]  spoiler alert for non-gaming.
[4628.64 --> 4629.40]  Very good.
[4629.54 --> 4630.12]  Very good.
[4630.14 --> 4631.18]  I would argue very good.
[4631.24 --> 4631.84]  Maybe even excellent.
[4632.68 --> 4632.88]  Yeah.
[4632.96 --> 4634.26]  Which is why I'm switching.
[4634.26 --> 4634.62]  Both of us.
[4635.14 --> 4635.98]  To say it again,
[4636.02 --> 4637.60]  which is why I'm genuinely switching
[4637.60 --> 4638.66]  my work laptop to Linux.
[4638.76 --> 4640.40]  And I genuinely think it's going to be
[4640.40 --> 4641.28]  significantly better experience.
[4641.30 --> 4644.14]  But that doesn't mean that it's perfect.
[4644.14 --> 4646.44]  And so what I'm hoping is that
[4646.44 --> 4647.90]  there are definitely some members
[4647.90 --> 4648.98]  of the Linux community
[4648.98 --> 4650.76]  that do not want to hear anything
[4650.76 --> 4652.48]  other than that Linux is perfect and amazing.
[4652.86 --> 4654.88]  But there are a lot of members of the community
[4654.88 --> 4656.88]  that do seem to be seeing this feedback
[4656.88 --> 4658.20]  and understanding that actually
[4658.20 --> 4659.74]  there are things that need to improve.
[4660.36 --> 4662.88]  And if an above average technical user
[4662.88 --> 4665.96]  is running into problems that are as simple as,
[4666.06 --> 4667.72]  okay, I'm not able to open and manipulate
[4667.72 --> 4669.06]  this type of document
[4669.06 --> 4672.28]  without ending up down six rabbit holes
[4672.28 --> 4675.74]  of ways to create a local security certificate
[4675.74 --> 4676.46]  on your system.
[4676.62 --> 4677.56]  Like this is ridiculous
[4677.56 --> 4680.32]  that something's got to change.
[4680.82 --> 4684.32]  And it's not something that is fundamentally wrong
[4684.32 --> 4684.90]  with Linux.
[4684.94 --> 4687.16]  It's just something that needs to be optimized
[4687.16 --> 4689.08]  across the various distros
[4689.08 --> 4689.98]  and desktop environments.
[4690.20 --> 4691.58]  Or ideally,
[4692.38 --> 4696.62]  you just have a consolidation take place
[4696.62 --> 4698.52]  for desktop environments
[4698.52 --> 4700.14]  and for distros.
[4700.14 --> 4701.10]  Because right now,
[4701.16 --> 4702.04]  one of the biggest problems
[4702.04 --> 4702.96]  is the fragmentation.
[4703.76 --> 4704.26]  And it's like,
[4704.32 --> 4706.64]  I understand that a lot of them
[4706.64 --> 4708.06]  have their own strengths.
[4708.06 --> 4710.36]  But I also believe that
[4710.36 --> 4712.64]  if there were more people
[4712.64 --> 4714.88]  working together towards a single goal,
[4715.12 --> 4717.16]  progress would probably be faster
[4717.16 --> 4718.82]  in at least some ways.
[4719.86 --> 4720.66]  There's also,
[4720.80 --> 4721.46]  yeah, I don't know.
[4721.52 --> 4723.40]  There's also bits like,
[4724.84 --> 4727.92]  like this came up in the Epos Vox video.
[4727.92 --> 4728.88]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[4729.02 --> 4729.48]  No, I didn't.
[4729.62 --> 4732.10]  Apparently, Epos Vox was like doing this already.
[4732.30 --> 4732.66]  Oh, really?
[4732.80 --> 4734.42]  But hadn't released any content on it.
[4734.50 --> 4734.86]  So like,
[4735.18 --> 4735.42]  oops,
[4735.54 --> 4737.14]  no, we did not steal the idea.
[4737.26 --> 4738.32]  He doesn't say that we did.
[4738.48 --> 4738.70]  Sorry, Eddie.
[4739.20 --> 4740.28]  He didn't say that we did.
[4740.40 --> 4741.22]  Yeah, well, either way,
[4741.24 --> 4742.30]  I mean, it's still awkward.
[4742.74 --> 4742.88]  Yeah.
[4742.96 --> 4743.32]  Like I,
[4743.70 --> 4747.80]  the stupid Kyle's bathroom gaming setup video.
[4748.04 --> 4749.38]  I had wanted to make that video
[4749.38 --> 4750.66]  for like two years.
[4750.78 --> 4752.34]  I had pitched it to so many brands
[4752.34 --> 4753.72]  and like the week
[4753.72 --> 4754.34]  or two weeks
[4754.34 --> 4755.42]  before we finally,
[4755.60 --> 4756.78]  finally released our video.
[4756.78 --> 4757.48]  He's like,
[4757.78 --> 4758.98]  I put a gaming setup in the bathroom.
[4762.18 --> 4763.40]  Same thing with Austin,
[4763.66 --> 4765.26]  his Walmart gaming PC.
[4766.26 --> 4766.78]  Like we,
[4766.88 --> 4768.14]  we ended up delaying it
[4768.14 --> 4769.18]  because pandemic
[4769.18 --> 4770.06]  and then delaying it
[4770.06 --> 4770.96]  because we were working
[4770.96 --> 4771.94]  with a brand on it.
[4772.02 --> 4772.58]  Blah, blah, blah.
[4772.82 --> 4773.56]  Austin released his
[4773.56 --> 4774.40]  like a week before ours.
[4774.96 --> 4775.12]  I,
[4775.28 --> 4775.58]  I,
[4775.74 --> 4777.00]  if you remember,
[4777.08 --> 4777.78]  there was the,
[4778.00 --> 4778.50]  there was that
[4778.50 --> 4779.28]  we,
[4779.32 --> 4779.80]  we ran,
[4779.90 --> 4780.88]  we filmed a nerd sports,
[4780.88 --> 4782.38]  which is the hockey nerd sports video.
[4782.68 --> 4783.98]  I like cut my ankles up.
[4783.98 --> 4785.22]  Then I had to come back to the office
[4785.22 --> 4786.74]  and film the networking wall video
[4786.74 --> 4788.30]  and then go directly to a plane.
[4788.94 --> 4790.30]  And that ends up launching
[4790.30 --> 4792.68]  like while Brandon and I are in Switzerland
[4792.68 --> 4793.76]  or wherever the heck we were.
[4795.28 --> 4797.64]  But Jay's video on a networking wall
[4797.64 --> 4799.44]  goes out like one to two days earlier
[4799.44 --> 4799.92]  or something.
[4800.40 --> 4802.10]  And that was one of the biggest
[4802.10 --> 4803.06]  like bro moves
[4803.06 --> 4804.98]  Jay's ever done for me,
[4804.98 --> 4806.12]  which was essentially
[4806.12 --> 4807.14]  when that came out,
[4807.14 --> 4808.00]  like obviously
[4808.00 --> 4810.02]  these things have much bigger runtime than that.
[4810.02 --> 4811.18]  I obviously didn't copy them.
[4811.36 --> 4813.00]  And when his community was like,
[4813.06 --> 4813.44]  Hey man,
[4813.54 --> 4814.20]  Luke copied you.
[4814.30 --> 4815.26]  His response was like,
[4815.38 --> 4816.10]  no.
[4817.66 --> 4818.40]  And I was like,
[4818.44 --> 4818.96]  thank you.
[4819.00 --> 4820.16]  That's actually so cool.
[4820.30 --> 4820.96]  I really,
[4821.30 --> 4822.06]  I will never forget that.
[4822.08 --> 4823.04]  And I appreciate it a lot.
[4823.14 --> 4823.60]  Um,
[4824.14 --> 4824.84]  but yeah.
[4825.86 --> 4826.18]  Uh,
[4826.18 --> 4827.16]  we should probably move on.
[4827.64 --> 4831.02]  EVGA lost a literal truckload of GPUs.
[4831.96 --> 4832.28]  Uh,
[4832.28 --> 4832.70]  Oh crap.
[4832.76 --> 4832.94]  Sorry.
[4833.02 --> 4833.52]  Before we do.
[4833.66 --> 4833.94]  Yeah.
[4834.08 --> 4835.76]  What I was trying to say about the EPOS Vox video.
[4835.94 --> 4836.18]  Right.
[4836.26 --> 4836.46]  Is,
[4836.56 --> 4838.00]  and I have mentioned this on this show
[4838.00 --> 4840.20]  and I strand strongly defend it.
[4840.24 --> 4840.64]  Uh,
[4840.64 --> 4842.00]  if you're running like arch,
[4842.14 --> 4844.34]  the whole internet says you shouldn't run arch.
[4844.68 --> 4846.00]  So whatever.
[4846.38 --> 4846.72]  Um,
[4846.76 --> 4849.30]  but I would say that a problem with that
[4849.30 --> 4850.72]  is there's a fair amount of,
[4850.88 --> 4851.22]  uh,
[4851.22 --> 4853.46]  distros that are based on arch.
[4854.68 --> 4855.04]  Uh,
[4855.38 --> 4858.14]  Garuda is the specific one that EPOS Vox is talking about.
[4858.20 --> 4858.32]  Yep.
[4858.58 --> 4858.94]  Um,
[4858.94 --> 4860.72]  that have a lot of the same issues,
[4860.72 --> 4863.82]  but are advertised to general audience.
[4863.90 --> 4865.72]  I had Garuda blasted to me a ton.
[4865.84 --> 4866.08]  Oh yeah.
[4866.08 --> 4867.72]  I got a ton of recommendations for Manjaro.
[4867.72 --> 4868.30]  People are like,
[4868.30 --> 4869.80]  where did you get the idea of using Manjaro?
[4869.98 --> 4870.68]  From all the people.
[4870.68 --> 4872.24]  It was one of the highest voted ones on,
[4872.30 --> 4872.88]  on one of the polls.
[4873.00 --> 4874.42]  From the people who said that it was good
[4874.42 --> 4876.42]  because it was like more bleeding edge
[4876.42 --> 4877.62]  and better for newer hardware.
[4877.78 --> 4879.02]  It's actually really interesting
[4879.02 --> 4880.60]  to see a lot of the talking points
[4880.60 --> 4881.38]  that get parroted
[4881.38 --> 4882.86]  about why we're having a bad experience.
[4882.86 --> 4884.26]  It's because we don't have an AMD GPU.
[4884.34 --> 4885.68]  It actually has nothing to do with that.
[4885.94 --> 4887.70]  Or it's because we're running really exotic hardware.
[4888.06 --> 4889.58]  The only thing in my setup
[4889.58 --> 4891.64]  that I think qualifies as exotic
[4891.64 --> 4893.62]  now that I know that the Thunderbolt 3 dock
[4893.62 --> 4895.48]  works absolutely effortlessly
[4895.48 --> 4897.20]  is my audio mixer.
[4897.72 --> 4899.60]  Everything else about my setup
[4899.60 --> 4900.16]  is like, what?
[4900.54 --> 4901.34]  Exotic what?
[4901.96 --> 4903.70]  It's a Threadripper 3000,
[4904.14 --> 4906.68]  which is not a new CPU or platform
[4906.68 --> 4907.98]  by any stretch of the imagination.
[4908.14 --> 4909.74]  It's a 2000 series NVIDIA card.
[4909.98 --> 4910.24]  And that's a,
[4910.24 --> 4910.76]  that's a,
[4910.88 --> 4912.54]  that's not even a consumer chip,
[4912.62 --> 4912.84]  is it?
[4912.84 --> 4914.34]  It's a workstation chip,
[4914.40 --> 4914.68]  but like,
[4914.68 --> 4915.32]  it doesn't matter.
[4915.42 --> 4916.88]  The point is just that it's a CPU
[4916.88 --> 4917.58]  from like,
[4917.92 --> 4919.48]  it was released almost two years ago.
[4919.66 --> 4921.74]  Linux is all like tuned fairly well
[4921.74 --> 4922.48]  for workstation stuff.
[4922.54 --> 4922.68]  Sorry,
[4922.76 --> 4923.00]  I keep going.
[4923.08 --> 4923.26]  Yeah.
[4923.36 --> 4924.48]  So I've got like,
[4924.54 --> 4924.86]  again,
[4924.90 --> 4926.88]  I've got like an 18 month old GPU.
[4927.88 --> 4929.34]  And then beyond that,
[4929.40 --> 4930.68]  what makes a computer exotic?
[4931.64 --> 4932.00]  Yeah.
[4932.06 --> 4932.98]  I don't have anything exotic.
[4933.30 --> 4933.58]  Nothing.
[4933.88 --> 4934.06]  Yeah.
[4934.36 --> 4934.54]  Like,
[4934.54 --> 4937.80]  I see a lot of people just kind of going,
[4937.94 --> 4938.02]  oh,
[4938.02 --> 4938.58]  there's a problem.
[4938.70 --> 4940.20]  Must be this thing I heard.
[4940.20 --> 4943.70]  But you have to actually look at what the problems are
[4943.70 --> 4948.56]  in order to find out if they're correlated
[4948.56 --> 4950.40]  with that like thing you heard about before.
[4952.04 --> 4954.26]  Nick Light is poking his head around the corner.
[4954.34 --> 4954.94]  What can I do for you,
[4954.98 --> 4955.08]  Nick?
[4955.12 --> 4956.32]  The mics are super,
[4956.66 --> 4957.42]  super directional.
[4957.62 --> 4959.12]  So they're not going to be able to hear you pretty much at all.
[4959.28 --> 4959.66]  I'm just,
[4959.80 --> 4961.92]  I'm trying to make sure you don't stay here all night.
[4962.00 --> 4963.70]  You should start doing merch messages soon
[4963.70 --> 4965.02]  because there's a lot of them in the mic.
[4965.18 --> 4965.46]  Oh,
[4965.56 --> 4965.82]  okay.
[4966.16 --> 4966.60]  All right.
[4966.62 --> 4966.92]  I will,
[4967.02 --> 4967.82]  I will have a look at that.
[4967.88 --> 4969.96]  There's definitely a couple of topics we want to look at
[4969.96 --> 4970.74]  pretty quick here.
[4971.94 --> 4972.34]  EVGA.
[4972.70 --> 4972.74]  Oh,
[4972.74 --> 4972.92]  sorry.
[4973.12 --> 4975.00]  I still got to get this out about the arch thing.
[4975.42 --> 4979.06]  He talks in his video about how there's sentiment on arch boards
[4979.06 --> 4983.36]  that updating your system is user error.
[4984.36 --> 4985.02]  Oh yeah.
[4985.06 --> 4985.50]  A hundred percent.
[4985.64 --> 4986.28]  That's crazy.
[4986.86 --> 4987.90]  That's absolutely.
[4988.34 --> 4988.62]  That's,
[4988.62 --> 4989.26]  that's crazy.
[4989.46 --> 4990.06]  If you want,
[4990.32 --> 4990.60]  okay.
[4990.80 --> 4991.98]  And I've talked about this before.
[4992.10 --> 4992.26]  Yeah.
[4992.26 --> 4993.06]  If you're super,
[4993.16 --> 4993.86]  super hardcore,
[4994.28 --> 4996.18]  there being a distro for you is cool.
[4996.42 --> 4996.68]  Yes.
[4996.76 --> 4998.30]  And if updating is user error,
[4998.30 --> 5000.74]  because you should know what is in all of those updates.
[5000.74 --> 5002.22]  And if it causes a problem that's on you,
[5002.28 --> 5003.16]  that's fine.
[5003.20 --> 5004.66]  In those super hardcore environments.
[5004.76 --> 5005.56]  I actually support that.
[5005.62 --> 5006.30]  That's totally cool.
[5007.66 --> 5008.92]  But when there's,
[5009.16 --> 5009.64]  when,
[5009.82 --> 5012.82]  when there's other distros that don't have the red flags that arch does.
[5012.92 --> 5013.32]  Yeah.
[5013.32 --> 5015.54]  because they might even be based on arch.
[5017.46 --> 5018.44]  That's a little rough.
[5018.84 --> 5019.08]  Yeah.
[5019.54 --> 5019.86]  Like,
[5019.94 --> 5021.82]  and then fragmentation becomes kind of weird.
[5021.82 --> 5022.16]  Cause like,
[5022.22 --> 5022.42]  why,
[5022.52 --> 5024.56]  why are you even making Garuda?
[5025.76 --> 5026.34]  Why do you,
[5026.46 --> 5027.58]  why do you exist?
[5027.58 --> 5028.26]  Or why are you,
[5028.48 --> 5031.40]  why are you advertising it in the way that you are?
[5031.58 --> 5032.58]  That might even be a different problem.
[5032.58 --> 5032.72]  I mean,
[5032.82 --> 5033.06]  it's,
[5033.26 --> 5033.50]  you gotta,
[5033.72 --> 5035.14]  words are a funny thing,
[5035.16 --> 5035.36]  right?
[5036.06 --> 5038.98]  We got to avoid the word advertising because I,
[5039.12 --> 5040.82]  my understanding is nobody in,
[5040.82 --> 5041.70]  or yeah,
[5041.70 --> 5043.00]  Garuda doesn't advertise.
[5043.24 --> 5044.56]  Nobody's paying to,
[5044.58 --> 5045.62]  to promote Garuda.
[5045.84 --> 5047.72]  So it becomes just this,
[5047.82 --> 5054.04]  it becomes this really complicated sort of game of messenger or messenger.
[5054.22 --> 5054.80]  What's the telephone.
[5054.90 --> 5058.74]  It becomes this complicated game of telephone where you've got users who are
[5058.74 --> 5062.56]  understandably enthusiastic about the things that they love,
[5062.56 --> 5068.06]  creating narratives that just don't make any sense.
[5068.06 --> 5069.32]  Um,
[5070.02 --> 5070.72]  and like maybe,
[5070.72 --> 5072.40]  maybe there is some really big reason for it.
[5072.42 --> 5072.54]  I,
[5072.54 --> 5073.80]  I've done zero,
[5074.28 --> 5075.84]  almost zero independent research on,
[5075.84 --> 5076.38]  on Garuda.
[5076.52 --> 5077.98]  I was just watching the epos box video.
[5078.32 --> 5078.60]  Check it out.
[5078.62 --> 5079.06]  It's pretty good.
[5079.18 --> 5080.82]  I saw it recommended quite a few times,
[5080.94 --> 5081.56]  but yes,
[5081.60 --> 5081.96]  exactly.
[5082.02 --> 5083.38]  I got it recommended to me a bunch.
[5083.90 --> 5086.70]  And if I didn't do like tons of research into it,
[5086.76 --> 5090.72]  I might not have known that the community would have told me that updating my
[5090.72 --> 5092.16]  system was user error.
[5092.54 --> 5095.26]  And if I knew that I would have never used that distro,
[5095.26 --> 5100.52]  but it's not like Garuda is often not communicated with the same red flags that
[5100.52 --> 5101.02]  Arch has.
[5101.38 --> 5103.26]  And I think it should be,
[5103.26 --> 5104.30]  I don't know.
[5104.36 --> 5104.54]  Whatever.
[5104.72 --> 5105.02]  Moving on.
[5105.22 --> 5108.92]  EVGA lost an entire truckload of GPUs to,
[5108.92 --> 5109.72]  uh,
[5110.02 --> 5111.52]  bandits essentially.
[5111.76 --> 5112.10]  Uh,
[5112.10 --> 5116.64]  so they said that they were stolen from a truck en route from San Francisco to
[5116.64 --> 5118.28]  their Southern California disti center.
[5118.28 --> 5119.54]  And the notice states,
[5119.64 --> 5122.56]  the company is aware of each graphics card taken during the incident with
[5122.56 --> 5128.74]  individuals values ranging from 330 us dollars to 2000 us dollars.
[5128.92 --> 5132.40]  They were quick to note that it is a criminal and civil offense to buy or
[5132.40 --> 5134.54]  receive property that has been stolen.
[5135.28 --> 5140.22]  And they went a step further and actually canceled the warranties on all of the
[5140.22 --> 5140.84]  cards in the shipment.
[5140.94 --> 5144.26]  So they will not register or honor any warranty or upgrade claims on these
[5144.26 --> 5144.60]  products.
[5144.60 --> 5147.24]  So if you're buying an EVGA GPU online for the next little bit,
[5147.74 --> 5149.20]  maybe think twice,
[5149.20 --> 5151.08]  unless you're getting it from a,
[5151.08 --> 5151.78]  uh,
[5151.78 --> 5153.08]  reputable site.
[5153.26 --> 5157.48]  Now discussion question here from Colin is what do you think are the odds that
[5157.48 --> 5160.86]  these are just going to be sold off on mass to a mining operation?
[5161.04 --> 5161.32]  Uh,
[5161.32 --> 5161.60]  yeah,
[5161.72 --> 5162.58]  that is definitely,
[5162.78 --> 5165.16]  definitely what is going to happen to them.
[5165.18 --> 5168.42]  You don't accidentally steal a truckload of GPUs.
[5168.42 --> 5171.04]  You have some idea what the heck you're going to do with those when you're done.
[5171.04 --> 5172.84]  Our next topic,
[5173.00 --> 5176.24]  Facebook is deleting its book of faces just days after rebranding itself.
[5176.36 --> 5180.22]  Facebook announced plans to delete a trove of the facial recognition data that
[5180.22 --> 5182.04]  they've collected on more than a billion individuals.
[5184.10 --> 5184.54]  Metas.
[5184.70 --> 5185.70]  I'm not calling them meta.
[5186.22 --> 5190.16]  Facebook's VP of artificial intelligence says the social network was making the
[5190.16 --> 5193.98]  change because of many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology
[5193.98 --> 5194.76]  in society,
[5194.76 --> 5197.80]  adding that the company still saw the software as a powerful tool,
[5197.80 --> 5201.76]  but every new technology brings with it potential for both benefit and concern.
[5202.62 --> 5202.64]  Uh,
[5202.64 --> 5202.74]  yeah,
[5202.76 --> 5203.28]  that's a big,
[5203.64 --> 5203.78]  right.
[5203.80 --> 5206.06]  I wonder why Facebook actually got rid of it all.
[5206.50 --> 5206.62]  Yeah.
[5206.94 --> 5210.90]  It like purely because they want to be seen in a better light.
[5212.76 --> 5213.56]  So this,
[5213.64 --> 5213.84]  uh,
[5213.84 --> 5216.98]  feature was called deep face and it was actually introduced in December,
[5217.10 --> 5218.96]  2010 to help save time,
[5218.96 --> 5219.48]  uh,
[5219.48 --> 5221.24]  tagging people in photos.
[5221.34 --> 5224.48]  It would automatically suggest people who appeared in a user's digital photo album
[5224.48 --> 5229.18]  and you could just tag them with a click instead of typing a whole thing,
[5229.32 --> 5231.04]  which is like actually a pretty cool feature.
[5231.30 --> 5233.30]  And I can see why people would want to use stuff like that.
[5233.52 --> 5235.34]  So Facebook is deleting the data,
[5235.52 --> 5239.00]  but several of Meta's current projects show that the company has no plans to stop
[5239.00 --> 5240.56]  collecting data about people's bodies.
[5240.74 --> 5241.18]  Uh,
[5241.18 --> 5243.04]  hyper-realistic avatars could be coming,
[5243.12 --> 5244.52]  which track your facial movements.
[5244.98 --> 5245.42]  Um,
[5245.42 --> 5248.08]  they've got a new VR headset that tracks the aforementioned facial movements
[5248.08 --> 5248.80]  and eye movement.
[5249.20 --> 5251.62]  They also weighed,
[5251.80 --> 5254.72]  but didn't implement incorporation of facial recognition into their Ray-Ban
[5254.72 --> 5255.38]  glasses collab.
[5255.50 --> 5255.62]  Okay.
[5255.62 --> 5258.50]  That is actually something that I would love to have as someone who's so bad
[5258.50 --> 5259.42]  with faces and names,
[5259.42 --> 5262.72]  just like a pair of glasses that did absolutely nothing,
[5262.72 --> 5265.98]  but pop up the name of whoever I'm talking to.
[5266.52 --> 5267.16]  I would,
[5267.22 --> 5267.90]  I would love that.
[5268.02 --> 5268.92]  It's privacy nightmare.
[5269.12 --> 5269.56]  That ain't happening.
[5270.52 --> 5271.32]  Ain't happening,
[5271.50 --> 5275.22]  but it'd be kind of nice if it could learn off of local data.
[5275.42 --> 5277.74]  So you could like,
[5277.84 --> 5279.40]  let me add you to my contacts.
[5279.60 --> 5279.88]  Yeah.
[5280.00 --> 5280.42]  I mean,
[5280.44 --> 5283.84]  that I think would be less invasive,
[5283.84 --> 5286.94]  but I could still see people having concerns,
[5286.94 --> 5287.40]  but man,
[5287.48 --> 5287.80]  when I'd,
[5287.80 --> 5289.10]  I'd hit them trade shows,
[5289.10 --> 5289.74]  I'd be like,
[5290.16 --> 5291.16]  I know who you are.
[5291.22 --> 5291.98]  I know who you are.
[5292.02 --> 5292.86]  I actually don't,
[5292.98 --> 5293.66]  but my glasses,
[5293.66 --> 5294.52]  my glasses,
[5294.66 --> 5294.88]  remember?
[5295.02 --> 5295.22]  Yeah.
[5296.22 --> 5296.70]  Um,
[5297.08 --> 5298.42]  don't install that app.
[5298.78 --> 5300.88]  Craig says a criminal might be in it.
[5301.18 --> 5301.42]  Uh,
[5301.42 --> 5302.34]  this is from,
[5302.34 --> 5302.86]  uh,
[5302.94 --> 5305.18]  Jonathan Horst on Wednesday.
[5305.18 --> 5306.48]  At Web Summit 2021,
[5307.02 --> 5308.58]  software senior vice president at Apple,
[5308.70 --> 5313.42]  Craig Federighi said in a keynote that sideloading is a criminal's best friend.
[5314.74 --> 5316.62]  You wouldn't sideload an app.
[5317.06 --> 5317.74]  Here's the quote.
[5317.88 --> 5318.74]  I want to address an argument.
[5318.88 --> 5319.36]  I hear a lot.
[5319.50 --> 5321.36]  Let people choose whether or not to sideload.
[5321.48 --> 5322.58]  Let them judge the risks,
[5322.58 --> 5325.52]  but history shows us that it doesn't play out the way we'd hope.
[5325.52 --> 5327.74]  Because even if you have no intention of sideloading,
[5327.90 --> 5331.86]  people are routinely coerced or tricked into doing it.
[5332.26 --> 5337.32]  So if you want to install Pokemon go on that old phone that it says it's not compatible on,
[5337.40 --> 5338.92]  even though it definitely works for sure.
[5338.92 --> 5341.22]  Don't do it.
[5341.30 --> 5341.54]  Apparently.
[5341.54 --> 5341.82]  Could be.
[5341.90 --> 5342.38]  I mean,
[5342.44 --> 5342.70]  he's,
[5342.70 --> 5343.50]  he might be a criminal.
[5343.76 --> 5344.42]  He's got a fair point.
[5344.50 --> 5346.40]  I can't sit here and go blah,
[5346.44 --> 5346.56]  blah,
[5346.62 --> 5346.88]  blah.
[5347.08 --> 5348.26]  The user experience,
[5348.36 --> 5348.86]  user experience,
[5348.94 --> 5349.62]  user experience.
[5349.76 --> 5350.06]  It's,
[5350.12 --> 5353.78]  it's a fair point here that the user experience could be bad.
[5353.78 --> 5355.92]  If you're not an educated user,
[5355.92 --> 5356.26]  I mean,
[5356.64 --> 5357.68]  all you have to do.
[5357.68 --> 5358.70]  I don't think that's the argument here at all.
[5358.78 --> 5359.70]  How does that make any sense?
[5360.00 --> 5363.42]  He's basically saying the user experience for a non-educated user.
[5363.54 --> 5364.04]  But it's not criminal.
[5365.68 --> 5366.08]  Well,
[5366.26 --> 5366.62]  okay.
[5366.74 --> 5368.06]  Pokemon go wouldn't be,
[5368.18 --> 5371.80]  but like a cyber criminal could trick you into sideloading an app.
[5371.92 --> 5374.40]  But does that mean that it should be like banned or something?
[5374.48 --> 5374.96]  Like what's it?
[5374.98 --> 5375.10]  Well,
[5375.10 --> 5375.86]  that's his argument.
[5376.10 --> 5376.22]  Yeah.
[5376.22 --> 5376.80]  That's stupid.
[5377.32 --> 5378.42]  I hate it.
[5378.44 --> 5378.86]  All right.
[5379.78 --> 5381.82]  It's because I think that like,
[5382.00 --> 5383.38]  I don't know how this applies,
[5383.38 --> 5386.10]  but this feels like in the same kind of line as right to repair.
[5386.30 --> 5390.28]  Like sideloading is already very hidden on your phone.
[5390.38 --> 5392.58]  It's not something you're going to naturally just do.
[5394.26 --> 5394.74]  No,
[5394.90 --> 5395.66]  but I would,
[5395.82 --> 5398.42]  I would bet hard money that the vast,
[5398.66 --> 5400.80]  vast majority of people have never sideloaded an app.
[5401.18 --> 5402.30]  That's probably true.
[5402.44 --> 5403.36]  So who cares?
[5403.70 --> 5407.02]  This is not something that's affecting like the vast,
[5407.28 --> 5408.94]  vast majority of average random users.
[5409.02 --> 5411.62]  And it would be very annoying if it was impossible.
[5412.32 --> 5412.76]  Well,
[5412.78 --> 5413.12]  it is.
[5413.38 --> 5414.20]  On iOS.
[5414.52 --> 5414.74]  Yeah.
[5414.94 --> 5415.62]  And it is annoying.
[5416.06 --> 5416.28]  Uh,
[5416.28 --> 5417.18]  this is really funny.
[5417.32 --> 5418.04]  Jonathan says,
[5418.12 --> 5419.98]  can we please stop referring to it as sideloading?
[5420.34 --> 5421.34]  It's installing.
[5421.68 --> 5423.10]  And we've been doing it for decades.
[5423.30 --> 5423.56]  Yes.
[5423.62 --> 5424.04]  That's fair.
[5424.28 --> 5426.42]  Like that would be like saying on,
[5426.42 --> 5426.78]  on,
[5426.78 --> 5427.44]  on Linux,
[5427.54 --> 5430.40]  you can't install things unless it's in the package manager now.
[5430.40 --> 5431.70]  Or on windows saying like,
[5431.90 --> 5432.08]  Oh,
[5432.40 --> 5432.70]  you know,
[5432.70 --> 5434.86]  that Microsoft store that you probably don't like,
[5434.86 --> 5436.94]  you have to use it for literally everything.
[5436.94 --> 5439.56]  I think that it could be as simple as Apple,
[5439.68 --> 5441.92]  just putting roadblocks in place that go,
[5442.08 --> 5442.40]  you know,
[5442.42 --> 5443.16]  don't do this.
[5443.16 --> 5445.42]  But then if the Linux challenge has taught me anything,
[5445.42 --> 5452.30]  it's that users who aren't familiar with the type of errors that a particular platform spits out.
[5452.30 --> 5452.80]  Yes.
[5452.80 --> 5453.64]  Listen to what I say.
[5453.78 --> 5453.98]  Yeah.
[5454.16 --> 5454.48]  Yes.
[5454.48 --> 5455.08]  Do as I say,
[5455.18 --> 5459.64]  or whatever the thing I had to type in was might not realize what a big deal that error is.
[5459.72 --> 5464.14]  The number of people that are still kind of writing that is kind of mind blowing.
[5464.28 --> 5466.54]  You did that from the package manager though.
[5466.74 --> 5472.66]  If installing an app on the iOS app store deleted your UI,
[5472.84 --> 5473.52]  I would say,
[5473.60 --> 5473.72]  yeah,
[5473.78 --> 5475.06]  maybe there's an issue with that too.
[5475.30 --> 5476.04]  But this is this,
[5476.18 --> 5477.16]  they're talking about sideloading.
[5477.22 --> 5479.10]  If you were doing something super advanced,
[5479.60 --> 5479.92]  that's,
[5479.92 --> 5480.54]  that's different.
[5480.54 --> 5484.64]  Installing steam through a package manager isn't like a super advanced action.
[5484.74 --> 5485.12]  There there's,
[5485.36 --> 5486.90]  there should be no expectation there.
[5487.06 --> 5489.08]  If your user experience isn't complete trash,
[5489.18 --> 5491.26]  that it's going to like destroy your UI.
[5491.50 --> 5495.74]  What people are mad about is that it clearly said what it was going to do.
[5496.04 --> 5496.18]  Yeah.
[5496.20 --> 5499.26]  It also clearly said a giant book worth of other stuff.
[5499.36 --> 5499.54]  Yeah.
[5499.60 --> 5500.22]  And it also,
[5500.54 --> 5505.62]  most of the things that were very scary that it was removing were not things that an average user
[5505.62 --> 5508.18]  would even be able to read and understand what they are.
[5508.32 --> 5509.64]  Like if you look at it,
[5509.64 --> 5510.14]  take,
[5510.22 --> 5511.08]  take off the,
[5511.08 --> 5512.20]  take off the,
[5512.20 --> 5512.60]  you know,
[5512.60 --> 5514.42]  years of Linux experience that you have,
[5514.46 --> 5517.20]  you might not even know that DE is going to be short for desktop environment.
[5517.30 --> 5517.92]  Why would you know that?
[5518.62 --> 5521.66]  Why would anyone other than a Linux user be familiar with that terminology?
[5524.26 --> 5525.52]  Nobody else calls it that.
[5525.52 --> 5526.64]  Um,
[5526.98 --> 5527.38]  so anyway,
[5528.08 --> 5528.70]  switch modder,
[5528.84 --> 5530.74]  Gary Bowser pleads guilty,
[5531.04 --> 5534.18]  owes Nintendo four and a half million dollars.
[5534.70 --> 5535.52]  Gary has admitted,
[5535.70 --> 5535.92]  actually,
[5535.96 --> 5536.70]  I'm going to call him Bowser.
[5536.94 --> 5540.16]  Bowser has admitted that SXOS devices.
[5540.34 --> 5542.92]  Primary design was to play pirated ROMs and,
[5542.92 --> 5543.12]  uh,
[5543.12 --> 5545.18]  was part of a group called team Excelsior.
[5545.18 --> 5549.56]  He was arrested last year in the Dominican Republic and then extradited to the United States.
[5549.82 --> 5550.26]  Executor?
[5551.18 --> 5551.40]  Sorry,
[5551.62 --> 5552.08]  extradited.
[5552.74 --> 5553.18]  Team Executor.
[5553.88 --> 5554.46]  Team Executor.
[5554.56 --> 5554.74]  Sorry.
[5555.06 --> 5555.88]  Did I call it the wrong thing?
[5556.26 --> 5556.66]  Excelsior?
[5556.90 --> 5557.60]  Did I call it that?
[5557.68 --> 5557.82]  Yeah.
[5557.82 --> 5558.04]  Oh,
[5558.04 --> 5558.20]  well,
[5558.30 --> 5558.40]  I,
[5558.58 --> 5559.14]  that's,
[5559.46 --> 5560.08]  like I said,
[5560.16 --> 5560.68]  very tired.
[5560.76 --> 5560.88]  Oh,
[5560.90 --> 5561.10]  good.
[5561.30 --> 5561.74]  Um,
[5562.82 --> 5567.20]  admits he knowingly and willfully participated in a cyber criminal enterprise that hacked
[5567.20 --> 5569.12]  leading gaming consoles and that he developed,
[5569.30 --> 5569.70]  manufactured,
[5569.86 --> 5570.08]  marketed,
[5570.16 --> 5573.04]  and sold a variety of circumvention devices between June,
[5573.10 --> 5574.44]  2013 and last year.
[5574.70 --> 5577.08]  Also created and supported ROM libraries.
[5577.74 --> 5583.30]  Nintendo alleges 65 to 150 million in losses from copyright infringement.
[5583.60 --> 5583.86]  Okay,
[5583.90 --> 5584.22]  Nintendo,
[5584.30 --> 5585.20]  it doesn't quite work that way.
[5585.88 --> 5586.36]  Um,
[5586.36 --> 5591.04]  and at one point actually released new Switch hardware that was designed to,
[5591.10 --> 5597.38]  to thwart these efforts and Team Executor then made new devices that could be soldered onto the Switch's internal circuit board.
[5597.46 --> 5604.90]  I actually haven't really kept up with the whole Nintendo console modding thing now that it's so risky to mod it and they can remotely break your device.
[5605.72 --> 5606.08]  Um,
[5606.52 --> 5607.98]  this is one of Nicholas's,
[5608.06 --> 5608.22]  uh,
[5608.22 --> 5609.08]  Nicholas Ploof's,
[5609.10 --> 5609.50]  uh,
[5609.50 --> 5610.44]  discussion points here.
[5610.52 --> 5612.16]  Should we stop buying Nintendo games?
[5612.26 --> 5616.14]  How else will Nintendo realize it doesn't make sense to prosecute homebrewers when they're
[5616.14 --> 5618.90]  first party retro options suck?
[5619.38 --> 5619.72]  They do.
[5619.82 --> 5620.40]  They're really horrible.
[5620.46 --> 5621.38]  From a legal standpoint,
[5621.38 --> 5621.88]  no,
[5621.98 --> 5623.50]  we don't really have a leg to stand on.
[5623.56 --> 5624.82]  They are the rights holders,
[5624.82 --> 5626.56]  but from a,
[5626.66 --> 5627.36]  from a just,
[5627.44 --> 5627.80]  you know,
[5627.88 --> 5628.24]  attitude,
[5628.44 --> 5629.82]  gamer attitude standpoint,
[5629.82 --> 5634.68]  I totally see where you're coming from Ploof and I will not be buying any of Nintendo's,
[5634.68 --> 5635.08]  uh,
[5635.14 --> 5636.18]  just don't buy their retro,
[5636.46 --> 5637.48]  retro Switch stuff.
[5637.60 --> 5637.62]  I,
[5637.66 --> 5639.04]  I honestly don't do that.
[5639.10 --> 5639.32]  It's,
[5639.44 --> 5640.28]  it's terrible.
[5640.78 --> 5641.20]  Uh,
[5641.30 --> 5641.50]  you,
[5641.56 --> 5642.30]  you mentioned the,
[5642.36 --> 5643.98]  like most people aren't going to know what DE means.
[5644.08 --> 5646.90]  So the float plane chat started making like random guesses,
[5647.38 --> 5648.28]  like desert Eagle.
[5648.96 --> 5649.40]  Yeah.
[5649.62 --> 5650.32]  D dust.
[5651.32 --> 5651.80]  Yeah.
[5652.60 --> 5653.04]  Yeah.
[5654.00 --> 5654.24]  Yeah.
[5654.24 --> 5654.60]  I don't know.
[5654.60 --> 5655.24]  Uh,
[5655.24 --> 5657.34]  we've got a couple more good topics here.
[5657.46 --> 5657.92]  Squid game.
[5657.98 --> 5660.56]  Cryptocurrency was a scam rug pull.
[5660.72 --> 5661.46]  Plot twist.
[5661.64 --> 5662.86]  You weren't able to,
[5662.86 --> 5666.14]  to get money back out of it when you bought in and then out of nowhere,
[5666.14 --> 5668.26]  they just took everything.
[5668.96 --> 5669.56]  Get wrecked.
[5670.02 --> 5670.42]  Yup.
[5670.76 --> 5671.24]  Um,
[5671.28 --> 5674.54]  so that happened and be careful if you're going to mess around with crypto.
[5674.64 --> 5676.86]  This one's from Anthony and he's mad.
[5677.04 --> 5677.36]  Okay.
[5677.74 --> 5678.58]  EA sports.
[5678.74 --> 5679.66]  It's in the chain.
[5679.66 --> 5680.06]  Okay.
[5680.20 --> 5680.96]  EA CEO,
[5681.08 --> 5684.24]  Andrew Wilson said during the most recent earnings call that NFTs in the
[5684.24 --> 5687.62]  blockchain are the future of the industry.
[5688.62 --> 5689.88]  Anthony Young's take,
[5690.22 --> 5690.60]  no,
[5690.74 --> 5692.22]  they are effing not.
[5692.52 --> 5695.36]  And he specifically highlighted a couple of,
[5695.36 --> 5695.68]  uh,
[5695.68 --> 5696.90]  keywords for me here.
[5697.38 --> 5697.78]  Uh,
[5697.84 --> 5699.30]  NF and T.
[5699.46 --> 5699.98]  Thank you,
[5700.04 --> 5703.74]  Anthony for the steaming hot pile of take right there.
[5703.74 --> 5704.30]  Uh,
[5704.52 --> 5707.34]  EA hasn't laid any plans for how this will be accomplished.
[5707.34 --> 5707.68]  However,
[5707.68 --> 5711.56]  this is hot on the heels of Ubisoft's own plans to bring NFTs to its games
[5711.56 --> 5712.42]  just last week.
[5712.92 --> 5713.36]  Interestingly,
[5713.76 --> 5716.44]  Ubisoft talks of games using a play to earn model,
[5716.58 --> 5719.96]  which would dole out digital content to players for playing the games,
[5720.40 --> 5721.76]  presumably with longer play time,
[5721.82 --> 5723.48]  getting rare drops or something like that.
[5723.88 --> 5724.46]  Anthony goes,
[5724.52 --> 5725.16]  I can see,
[5725.44 --> 5725.64]  uh,
[5725.64 --> 5728.54]  I can't see any way this could backfire as if I needed another reason to
[5728.54 --> 5729.60]  hate both of these companies.
[5730.32 --> 5730.48]  Uh,
[5730.48 --> 5733.58]  NFTs for the uninitiated are non fungible tokens.
[5733.58 --> 5737.22]  So it's a concept that ties ownership of a digital good to a ledger or to a
[5737.22 --> 5739.98]  blockchain in an effort to make the sale of digital assets more trustworthy.
[5740.82 --> 5741.92]  Here comes the Anthony rant.
[5742.00 --> 5743.04]  Do you want to read the Anthony rant?
[5743.30 --> 5743.46]  Sure.
[5744.04 --> 5745.00]  I'm mad.
[5746.26 --> 5747.88]  This sounds great in theory,
[5748.02 --> 5748.60]  but there is a,
[5748.90 --> 5749.26]  uh,
[5749.36 --> 5753.86]  that there is a very real problem with NFTs where artists far from getting paid
[5753.86 --> 5758.40]  for their work are having their work or even tweets converted to NFTs and
[5758.40 --> 5759.72]  sold by third parties.
[5759.72 --> 5763.06]  Sometimes pro programmatically by bots,
[5763.18 --> 5763.72]  uh,
[5763.72 --> 5767.90]  it's being abused for pump and dump schemes and NFTs notoriously sell for
[5767.90 --> 5769.14]  ridiculous sums of money.
[5769.14 --> 5769.90]  As a result,
[5769.90 --> 5770.66]  uh,
[5770.66 --> 5773.58]  several NFT games have launched and attempted to launch,
[5773.58 --> 5774.06]  uh,
[5774.06 --> 5776.64]  many with stolen art assets made into NFTs.
[5776.64 --> 5777.48]  Some even,
[5777.48 --> 5778.88]  I'm just ad-libbing this bit,
[5778.88 --> 5779.52]  but some,
[5779.52 --> 5781.86]  even the cover art for the game,
[5781.86 --> 5782.20]  like the,
[5782.30 --> 5784.44]  one of the most obvious things that you don't even need to play the game to
[5784.44 --> 5786.14]  see has been stolen art,
[5786.22 --> 5787.58]  which is pretty epic.
[5787.58 --> 5788.58]  Um,
[5788.58 --> 5790.48]  it's unsurprising that EA games,
[5790.48 --> 5791.26]  uh,
[5791.26 --> 5792.16]  would want in,
[5792.52 --> 5795.04]  but in the meaning of the term as it exists today,
[5795.04 --> 5796.16]  I can't see this working out.
[5796.28 --> 5796.44]  Oh,
[5796.70 --> 5801.60]  and NFTs require a buttload of power because they typically use proof of work
[5801.60 --> 5802.34]  blockchains,
[5802.58 --> 5804.20]  which is the thing.
[5804.56 --> 5804.74]  Yep.
[5805.50 --> 5808.82]  Valve for their part wants nothing to do with NFTs and they have blocked
[5808.82 --> 5810.98]  cryptocurrency and NFT games from the steam platform.
[5811.40 --> 5813.00]  And in response to valve's ban,
[5813.36 --> 5816.84]  Tim Sweeney announced that Epic game store would welcome them after having
[5816.84 --> 5819.64]  criticized NFTs for exactly the same reasons that,
[5819.64 --> 5820.12]  um,
[5820.76 --> 5822.00]  Anthony's rant exists.
[5822.46 --> 5823.36]  So yeah,
[5823.36 --> 5825.66]  thank you for your unwavering principles,
[5825.90 --> 5826.06]  Mr.
[5826.12 --> 5826.52]  Sweeney.
[5826.88 --> 5827.28]  Um,
[5827.90 --> 5828.98]  but Hey,
[5829.56 --> 5830.10]  um,
[5830.10 --> 5836.74]  I think NFTs are an interesting concept.
[5836.96 --> 5841.66]  I think the idea of having this like non fungible thing,
[5841.66 --> 5842.16]  like this,
[5842.16 --> 5844.60]  like extremely modern version of a,
[5844.60 --> 5845.52]  um,
[5846.06 --> 5847.98]  like a certificate for authenticity.
[5848.32 --> 5852.14]  One of type of situation is a very interesting concept.
[5852.14 --> 5852.50]  Yep.
[5852.50 --> 5856.96]  I think a lot of the ways that it's currently being used is ridiculous,
[5857.54 --> 5857.88]  um,
[5857.88 --> 5858.84]  abusive and illegal,
[5859.02 --> 5864.18]  which is why we are focused on selling you guys physical goods.
[5864.58 --> 5864.98]  Oh,
[5865.16 --> 5867.16]  my word.
[5867.46 --> 5867.90]  Um,
[5867.98 --> 5868.48]  there's a few,
[5868.60 --> 5869.72]  this is a bit of a problem.
[5869.92 --> 5874.08]  We've got 142 merch messages that have rolled in over the course of the
[5874.08 --> 5874.38]  show.
[5874.54 --> 5875.24]  Hey guys,
[5875.30 --> 5876.88]  thank you very much for your support.
[5876.88 --> 5878.88]  We are clearly not going to be able to read all of them,
[5878.88 --> 5880.70]  but I'm going to get through at least a few of them.
[5880.78 --> 5882.12]  We need to get a character limit on that,
[5882.18 --> 5882.40]  please.
[5883.68 --> 5884.16]  Got it.
[5884.42 --> 5884.74]  Aaron.
[5884.88 --> 5885.40]  That's a good point.
[5885.48 --> 5886.76]  Thanks to the WAN show and LTT.
[5886.94 --> 5888.44]  I've reignited my interest in it.
[5888.66 --> 5889.28]  Heck yeah.
[5889.88 --> 5890.24]  Um,
[5890.56 --> 5891.58]  the banana is pog.
[5891.72 --> 5892.12]  All right,
[5892.18 --> 5892.38]  cool.
[5892.42 --> 5893.46]  Should we do like old school tweets,
[5893.54 --> 5894.28]  120 characters?
[5894.40 --> 5894.54]  Wow.
[5894.56 --> 5895.80]  People are super into the bananas.
[5896.34 --> 5896.58]  Uh,
[5896.78 --> 5897.82]  yeah.
[5898.42 --> 5898.58]  Well,
[5898.66 --> 5899.06]  well,
[5899.16 --> 5899.42]  yeah,
[5899.42 --> 5900.96]  let's start with that and see how it goes.
[5901.46 --> 5901.76]  Uh,
[5901.88 --> 5902.74]  Jay said,
[5902.82 --> 5903.52]  not that Jay,
[5903.62 --> 5904.04]  different Jay.
[5904.20 --> 5906.98]  I bought a 2080 TI a month before the 3000 series announcement.
[5907.14 --> 5908.76]  I felt torn ever since if I made the right
[5908.76 --> 5909.12]  decision.
[5909.26 --> 5909.40]  Yeah,
[5909.40 --> 5909.78]  you're fine.
[5909.84 --> 5912.78]  You could still sell that for more than you like paid for it at this
[5912.78 --> 5913.04]  point.
[5914.36 --> 5914.80]  Uh,
[5915.32 --> 5916.14]  Jareth says,
[5916.84 --> 5918.70]  Jareth got a stealth hoodie,
[5918.78 --> 5919.48]  a mystery t-shirt,
[5919.60 --> 5921.30]  reflective circuit t-shirt,
[5921.78 --> 5922.56]  two desk pads.
[5922.80 --> 5923.78]  Good gravy.
[5924.30 --> 5925.84]  What's the best way to clean the new spout lids?
[5926.04 --> 5926.32]  Um,
[5926.32 --> 5927.78]  I'd recommend getting one of those little,
[5927.78 --> 5928.36]  um,
[5928.36 --> 5929.44]  like brush,
[5929.60 --> 5930.86]  the circular brush things.
[5931.38 --> 5931.62]  Um,
[5931.64 --> 5936.06]  also I would strongly recommend only putting water in water bottles just
[5936.06 --> 5937.46]  because it's way,
[5937.76 --> 5939.52]  way easier to clean them.
[5939.80 --> 5940.22]  Uh,
[5940.22 --> 5943.20]  you can throw the lid in the dishwasher if you really wanted to,
[5943.30 --> 5945.84]  but do not put the bottle in the dishwasher.
[5947.46 --> 5948.54]  All right.
[5949.22 --> 5949.70]  Um,
[5949.82 --> 5951.08]  Tao says,
[5951.20 --> 5953.36]  how would you feel about your kids wanting to join Facebook or Instagram?
[5953.62 --> 5954.34]  Not yet.
[5955.30 --> 5957.90]  Not anytime soon.
[5959.28 --> 5959.76]  Uh,
[5959.76 --> 5959.98]  Paul,
[5959.98 --> 5960.22]  yes,
[5960.24 --> 5961.90]  we know the geek is back at Intel.
[5962.52 --> 5963.06]  It's a,
[5963.08 --> 5963.72]  it's a good thing.
[5964.66 --> 5965.06]  Uh,
[5965.26 --> 5966.86]  since I got a brand new PC,
[5967.12 --> 5967.64]  says Chris,
[5968.22 --> 5968.44]  uh,
[5968.44 --> 5968.92]  Alexander.
[5969.20 --> 5969.38]  Hi,
[5969.48 --> 5971.12]  longish time watcher of the channel.
[5971.28 --> 5973.32]  Bought an EVGA X99 board.
[5973.76 --> 5974.18]  I pro,
[5974.18 --> 5974.30]  Oh,
[5974.36 --> 5980.14]  I bought the EVGA X99 board used in the OG mineral oil PC from an LTX goer on
[5980.14 --> 5981.22]  Reddit a while back.
[5981.86 --> 5982.26]  Unfortunately,
[5982.50 --> 5985.58]  two capacitors fell off in shipping when it arrived.
[5985.68 --> 5986.46]  I tried to fix it,
[5986.46 --> 5990.68]  but the Xeon I had to test with wasn't technically on the list of supported CPUs and it didn't post.
[5991.10 --> 5992.96]  The previous user had it working.
[5993.06 --> 5995.48]  So not sure if it's my repair or the unsupported processor,
[5995.72 --> 5999.34]  but I was wondering if there's a good board repair service you could recommend,
[5999.52 --> 6002.22]  or if you wanted to have a go at fixing it in a video or something.
[6002.88 --> 6003.20]  Cool.
[6003.32 --> 6007.90]  I can't promise you that we would want to do a video about that.
[6008.26 --> 6009.74]  And honestly speaking,
[6009.74 --> 6015.42]  I would say that an X99 board is probably not worth the cost of paying somebody else
[6015.42 --> 6018.62]  to do a repair for you to put a couple of caps back on.
[6019.12 --> 6019.96]  With that said,
[6020.40 --> 6021.86]  maybe guys hit up the,
[6022.06 --> 6022.26]  Oh,
[6022.44 --> 6023.98]  go with maybe Twitch chat.
[6024.04 --> 6025.84]  That's a bit of slower moving than the YouTube chat.
[6026.22 --> 6032.06]  See if you can post some resources for Alexander for a good guide to how to recap a motherboard.
[6033.00 --> 6033.24]  Cody,
[6033.40 --> 6036.26]  I'm a PhD student working with semiconductors and quantum dots.
[6036.38 --> 6037.72]  Here's some money for all the help.
[6037.72 --> 6040.72]  The quantum dot videos they've given me to explain to people what I do.
[6041.16 --> 6041.36]  Hey,
[6041.44 --> 6042.12]  thanks Cody.
[6042.56 --> 6043.76]  Got that banana for scale,
[6043.90 --> 6044.68]  ethernet t-shirt.
[6044.68 --> 6050.12]  Patrick managed to grab one of the few remaining WAN show hoodies.
[6052.38 --> 6054.82]  Some of these messages are chungus.
[6055.32 --> 6055.76]  Yeah.
[6056.30 --> 6058.72]  I might just not be able to do a lot of the really long ones.
[6058.94 --> 6059.14]  Thanks,
[6059.22 --> 6059.48]  Tyler.
[6059.94 --> 6060.26]  Thanks,
[6060.36 --> 6060.80]  David.
[6062.58 --> 6063.02]  Oh,
[6063.12 --> 6063.32]  wow.
[6063.38 --> 6064.12]  This is hilarious.
[6064.52 --> 6068.90]  David managed to buy $307 worth of stuff.
[6069.04 --> 6070.66]  Like one of basically everything.
[6071.18 --> 6071.34]  Hi,
[6071.40 --> 6071.72]  Linus.
[6071.72 --> 6075.38]  One way to make the shipping cost to Europe better is to order bigger.
[6077.60 --> 6078.28]  By the way,
[6078.36 --> 6081.56]  can you make the Linux streams you did with Luke on Twitch available as a VOD?
[6081.64 --> 6083.44]  They are on float plane somewhere.
[6083.64 --> 6089.56]  Sometimes they're hidden because there's a bit of a weird thing with our live VODs where it'll,
[6089.94 --> 6092.16]  if we post stream twice in the same day,
[6092.16 --> 6095.02]  it'll post as two video files on the same post.
[6095.02 --> 6098.50]  So you might have to look at some WAN shows and see if there's a second video file for some of them.
[6098.60 --> 6100.62]  But I believe they are all on there.
[6101.64 --> 6103.32]  Do you want to start doing some of these too?
[6103.56 --> 6103.92]  Sure.
[6105.12 --> 6105.48]  Duval.
[6106.24 --> 6108.86]  Full throttle 099 says,
[6108.94 --> 6109.10]  Hi,
[6109.16 --> 6109.48]  Linus.
[6109.90 --> 6110.38]  All right.
[6110.46 --> 6110.78]  Cool.
[6111.50 --> 6113.00]  Finally purchased from LTS store.com.
[6113.06 --> 6114.84]  I've been watching for 11 to 12 years now.
[6114.94 --> 6115.28]  Keep it up.
[6115.32 --> 6116.36]  I'm honored to be part of the community.
[6117.32 --> 6118.58]  Brian went hard,
[6118.70 --> 6120.86]  bought the entire banana for scale pack.
[6121.08 --> 6122.94]  I think it's called like bushel bananas or something.
[6123.02 --> 6124.22]  We made like a bundle for it.
[6124.30 --> 6125.08]  One of every color.
[6125.22 --> 6126.04]  One of every color.
[6126.78 --> 6131.42]  Also got three different lanyards and two spout lids and a beanie.
[6131.42 --> 6134.22]  That's got to be one of the most interesting orders like ever.
[6135.68 --> 6136.06]  You said,
[6136.48 --> 6138.84]  need a banana for scale for the scale bananas.
[6139.20 --> 6140.94]  This is surprising.
[6141.58 --> 6145.28]  Ryan bought the banana bunch as well.
[6145.42 --> 6146.26]  So did Frank.
[6146.84 --> 6148.64]  More people than I could have pot.
[6148.76 --> 6149.04]  Garrett.
[6149.66 --> 6153.36]  More people than I could have possibly expected or buying the banana bunch.
[6153.42 --> 6154.30]  They want all the bananas.
[6154.70 --> 6155.24]  Hand of bananas.
[6155.30 --> 6156.60]  It's called hand of bananas.
[6157.20 --> 6157.62]  Thanks,
[6157.72 --> 6159.90]  Alexander and John Pierce.
[6160.06 --> 6160.50]  You know what?
[6160.62 --> 6161.08]  They actually,
[6161.20 --> 6163.64]  the name goes up there if they want to show their name anyway,
[6163.64 --> 6164.08]  doesn't it?
[6164.08 --> 6166.64]  So I don't probably need to do just like name shout outs.
[6166.74 --> 6167.28]  Do I know?
[6167.96 --> 6168.92]  Pierce asks though,
[6168.96 --> 6170.86]  is there an archive of the newsletter?
[6171.04 --> 6171.36]  I signed up,
[6171.42 --> 6172.64]  but I haven't gotten anything yet.
[6172.76 --> 6173.24]  Love the merge.
[6173.34 --> 6174.08]  Keep up the high quality.
[6174.24 --> 6175.36]  I have no idea.
[6175.36 --> 6179.88]  I guess that's something that we could like maybe put as a blog on the page or something.
[6179.88 --> 6180.42]  We could try.
[6180.52 --> 6181.08]  We could make,
[6181.08 --> 6182.22]  we could make something for it.
[6182.36 --> 6182.50]  Yeah.
[6182.50 --> 6182.84]  That's a,
[6182.84 --> 6183.66]  that's a pretty good idea.
[6184.30 --> 6184.46]  Um,
[6184.52 --> 6184.74]  thanks.
[6184.80 --> 6185.38]  Thanks Pierce.
[6185.64 --> 6187.58]  Does that dissuade people from signing up for the newsletter?
[6187.58 --> 6188.30]  Uh,
[6188.34 --> 6192.30]  I don't think I care as long as they're like going on the site and checking it out and learning something.
[6192.42 --> 6192.68]  I mean,
[6193.02 --> 6193.20]  yeah,
[6193.20 --> 6193.48]  whatever.
[6193.58 --> 6193.78]  Right.
[6193.98 --> 6194.54]  That makes sense.
[6194.74 --> 6194.90]  Yep.
[6195.44 --> 6195.92]  Um,
[6196.86 --> 6197.38]  Nathaniel,
[6197.58 --> 6203.20]  could you guys sell a static grounding bracelet that doubles as like an everyday wear bracelet?
[6204.78 --> 6206.46]  That's kind of a cool idea too,
[6206.52 --> 6206.80]  isn't it?
[6206.80 --> 6207.24]  Aesthetic.
[6208.78 --> 6209.16]  Sorry.
[6210.02 --> 6210.42]  Nothing.
[6210.68 --> 6210.86]  Sorry.
[6211.96 --> 6213.36]  I love that idea.
[6213.52 --> 6214.50]  I think that's so cool.
[6215.22 --> 6215.50]  Um,
[6215.50 --> 6216.38]  all right.
[6216.48 --> 6216.94]  You know what?
[6216.98 --> 6218.54]  I'm going to write that down.
[6218.62 --> 6219.80]  It sounds like a design challenge,
[6219.80 --> 6220.58]  but you know,
[6220.58 --> 6221.14]  yeah,
[6221.26 --> 6221.50]  well,
[6221.66 --> 6221.74]  I,
[6221.84 --> 6225.44]  the way that I imagine it is you would have it kind of detachable or something like that.
[6225.68 --> 6227.42]  So everyday wear,
[6227.42 --> 6228.48]  uh,
[6228.90 --> 6229.64]  whoops.
[6229.78 --> 6229.96]  Oh,
[6229.96 --> 6230.68]  it's backspace,
[6230.80 --> 6232.22]  ESD bracelet.
[6232.46 --> 6232.78]  Yeah.
[6232.80 --> 6233.60]  I like it.
[6233.68 --> 6234.56]  That's a cool idea.
[6236.72 --> 6237.16]  Okay.
[6237.16 --> 6237.54]  What's next?
[6238.48 --> 6238.96]  Uh,
[6239.02 --> 6241.22]  will the constellation shirt ever come back in stock?
[6241.36 --> 6241.64]  Yes.
[6242.02 --> 6242.54]  Thank you,
[6242.54 --> 6242.80]  John.
[6243.20 --> 6243.50]  Uh,
[6243.50 --> 6244.68]  thanks for all the great content.
[6244.82 --> 6245.34]  Thank you,
[6245.38 --> 6245.68]  Frank.
[6248.68 --> 6250.42]  Love the quality of your merch.
[6250.58 --> 6251.86]  It is possible to see,
[6252.00 --> 6252.72]  is it possible to see?
[6252.78 --> 6253.14]  Oh yeah.
[6253.16 --> 6255.90]  There's another person asking for previous versions of the leak.
[6256.28 --> 6261.02]  So I think a lot of people must've liked the color theory one and they want to see more.
[6261.02 --> 6261.50]  Basically.
[6262.06 --> 6262.46]  Christopher.
[6262.76 --> 6266.24]  I waited a week to order just to see it pop up on the screen.
[6266.60 --> 6267.50]  Oh boy.
[6268.28 --> 6268.58]  Oh,
[6268.66 --> 6269.22]  I love it.
[6269.98 --> 6270.32]  Oh man.
[6270.32 --> 6272.24]  Have you guys looked into making computer themed,
[6272.24 --> 6272.96]  uh,
[6273.26 --> 6274.02]  pin badges?
[6275.28 --> 6275.76]  Um,
[6275.86 --> 6276.26]  yes.
[6277.24 --> 6277.50]  Yeah.
[6277.56 --> 6278.10]  So we're,
[6278.30 --> 6279.46]  we're working on,
[6279.52 --> 6279.74]  sorry,
[6279.82 --> 6280.22]  pinned that,
[6280.22 --> 6280.84]  you mean like pins,
[6280.94 --> 6281.10]  right?
[6281.32 --> 6281.48]  Yeah.
[6281.64 --> 6281.80]  Yeah.
[6281.84 --> 6282.00]  Yeah.
[6282.00 --> 6282.18]  We're,
[6282.26 --> 6283.22]  we're working on some pins.
[6283.34 --> 6283.46]  Uh,
[6283.46 --> 6285.58]  Sarah designed a GPU one that's going to be coming soon.
[6286.00 --> 6286.30]  Uh,
[6286.30 --> 6289.90]  I'm talking to Nick about what we can do for a lot of the time orders come with a free
[6289.90 --> 6290.10]  item.
[6290.10 --> 6291.32]  It's usually a pack of stickers.
[6291.32 --> 6291.66]  In fact,
[6291.66 --> 6293.06]  it's always a pack of stickers right now,
[6293.06 --> 6297.86]  but I want to explore whether our costs for pins could be low enough that we could
[6297.86 --> 6299.20]  actually make it your choice.
[6299.42 --> 6300.92]  Whether you want to get a sticker pack,
[6301.00 --> 6301.48]  a pin,
[6301.48 --> 6303.10]  or maybe we could find like,
[6303.50 --> 6303.78]  uh,
[6303.78 --> 6304.84]  like a fun little edible,
[6304.84 --> 6307.38]  like gamer gummies or something like that.
[6307.38 --> 6307.82]  Um,
[6307.82 --> 6310.76]  and you could actually choose what you want and then we'll just make all those items
[6310.76 --> 6311.76]  available to buy.
[6311.82 --> 6315.36]  Like right now you can't buy the sticker pack and we've had some complaints about that.
[6315.36 --> 6315.72]  So,
[6316.24 --> 6316.66]  um,
[6316.92 --> 6317.80]  we can make it like,
[6317.80 --> 6320.00]  and we've also seen people complain that they don't care about stickers.
[6320.22 --> 6321.64]  So making it people's option,
[6321.72 --> 6323.88]  whether they want the free item or what free item they want,
[6323.90 --> 6324.84]  I think could be kind of cool.
[6324.84 --> 6327.60]  At least one person in chat got my aesthetic pun.
[6327.76 --> 6327.98]  Oh,
[6328.08 --> 6328.36]  sorry.
[6328.40 --> 6329.62]  I just completely didn't hear you.
[6329.74 --> 6329.96]  It's okay.
[6331.02 --> 6331.46]  Um,
[6332.38 --> 6333.32]  your products are amazing.
[6333.40 --> 6335.08]  I agree with 90% of what you guys do.
[6335.08 --> 6336.54]  10% is a healthy difference.
[6336.90 --> 6337.24]  Uh,
[6337.36 --> 6338.00]  plush banana.
[6338.24 --> 6342.14]  I support this like Linus avoids challenges in Beat Saber.
[6342.32 --> 6342.84]  Signed,
[6342.92 --> 6343.48]  Nathanor.
[6343.90 --> 6344.42]  Thanks,
[6344.52 --> 6345.04]  Nathanor.
[6345.28 --> 6345.70]  Whoa.
[6346.18 --> 6346.56]  Ouch.
[6346.88 --> 6347.40]  Ouch.
[6347.48 --> 6348.26]  Got that fire.
[6350.18 --> 6350.66]  Uh,
[6350.76 --> 6351.52]  Francois says,
[6351.58 --> 6353.38]  looking forward to the M1 max coverage.
[6353.38 --> 6353.94]  Yes,
[6354.02 --> 6358.02]  it's coming and asks if gaming on Mac OS can take advantage of the
[6358.02 --> 6358.32]  horsepower.
[6358.54 --> 6363.46]  So my short circuit unboxing of the first M1 max Mac that I got my
[6363.46 --> 6363.94]  hands on,
[6364.08 --> 6365.68]  I played me some,
[6365.68 --> 6366.14]  uh,
[6366.36 --> 6366.52]  Oh,
[6366.60 --> 6366.92]  bloody hell.
[6366.98 --> 6367.48]  What's that game called?
[6367.56 --> 6368.16]  Deus ex,
[6368.48 --> 6368.98]  um,
[6369.54 --> 6370.22]  mankind divided.
[6370.38 --> 6370.62]  Okay.
[6370.62 --> 6370.82]  Yeah.
[6375.84 --> 6376.84]  Pretty cool.
[6378.42 --> 6379.76]  It's a gaming Mac.
[6380.20 --> 6383.36]  William bought the entire banana for scale.
[6383.38 --> 6385.76]  Package and also an extra orange one.
[6386.58 --> 6387.02]  Um,
[6387.32 --> 6388.36]  it says every single color,
[6388.48 --> 6389.58]  but two oranges.
[6389.74 --> 6390.30]  That's epic.
[6391.18 --> 6391.30]  Uh,
[6391.30 --> 6393.54]  Niam's apparently been waiting for the WAN hoodie for six months.
[6393.60 --> 6393.70]  Yeah.
[6393.74 --> 6396.26]  I really shouldn't have started wearing this on camera so early.
[6396.54 --> 6396.90]  Uh,
[6396.90 --> 6399.34]  Nick got mad at me about how early I was wearing the thing,
[6399.40 --> 6402.30]  but it certainly resulted in like crazy demand.
[6402.30 --> 6405.76]  We already sold through almost all of our 4,000 units.
[6406.40 --> 6406.76]  Um,
[6407.00 --> 6407.58]  they're just,
[6407.66 --> 6408.60]  they're gone.
[6408.72 --> 6408.84]  Uh,
[6408.84 --> 6410.48]  we've never seen anything quite like it.
[6410.88 --> 6411.38]  Hayden says,
[6411.44 --> 6413.02]  thanks for selling the lid separate.
[6413.14 --> 6416.72]  I've had my water bottle for almost two years and the original lid finally broke.
[6417.14 --> 6417.50]  Um,
[6417.50 --> 6419.08]  I look forward to trying a new one.
[6419.52 --> 6419.64]  Uh,
[6419.64 --> 6419.92]  yeah.
[6419.98 --> 6422.54]  So we're also exploring other lid options.
[6422.54 --> 6424.84]  And I think at some point in the future,
[6424.84 --> 6426.38]  we'd love to,
[6426.38 --> 6426.84]  uh,
[6426.84 --> 6429.50]  see if there's a way to turn it into like a configurator.
[6429.82 --> 6430.18]  Uh,
[6430.18 --> 6434.34]  one of the cool things that Luke's team has been working on is a configurator for the desk pad.
[6434.58 --> 6434.68]  Yeah.
[6434.74 --> 6436.26]  Is there any way for us to show that to them?
[6436.44 --> 6436.94]  Uh,
[6437.02 --> 6438.08]  conveniently or no,
[6438.08 --> 6448.58]  but basically you enter the dimensions of your desk and then you can select your desk pad and it'll show you how good of a fit that desk pad will be for your desk.
[6448.58 --> 6449.80]  It's super rudimentary now,
[6449.80 --> 6450.82]  but I,
[6450.82 --> 6453.06]  I find that particularly because,
[6453.34 --> 6453.56]  uh,
[6453.56 --> 6455.82]  the measurements are in millimeters and in North America,
[6455.82 --> 6457.24]  a lot of desks are in inches.
[6457.58 --> 6460.14]  We've seen people kind of have a hard time,
[6460.38 --> 6465.04]  at least mentally visualizing how big that pad is going to look on their desk.
[6465.04 --> 6466.84]  And we want to make that a little bit easier for people.
[6467.32 --> 6468.06]  You keep going.
[6468.14 --> 6468.60]  I'm trying to get it.
[6468.64 --> 6468.86]  Thanks.
[6468.94 --> 6469.26]  Niam.
[6471.40 --> 6471.80]  Uh,
[6471.80 --> 6472.06]  thanks.
[6472.14 --> 6472.74]  Kevin too.
[6472.96 --> 6474.36]  Got my WAN hoodie today,
[6474.40 --> 6476.00]  along with LTT water bottle for my nephew,
[6476.12 --> 6477.78]  stocking up on some more gifts for the holidays.
[6477.88 --> 6478.40]  Heck yeah.
[6478.40 --> 6479.40]  Uh,
[6479.96 --> 6484.28]  Dustin says Anthony slash Linux Fox plush.
[6484.54 --> 6484.82]  When,
[6484.82 --> 6486.16]  and Anthony plus.
[6486.24 --> 6486.34]  Yeah.
[6486.34 --> 6489.24]  There's no reason we would only do a little Linus plush.
[6489.24 --> 6491.92]  I think we could do like some runs of,
[6492.14 --> 6492.80]  some other plushes.
[6492.90 --> 6496.32]  One of the things that I've worried about doing anyone other than me is,
[6496.32 --> 6496.92]  um,
[6496.96 --> 6501.42]  that I don't want it to seem like we're playing favorites and I don't want to turn it into like a political thing.
[6501.42 --> 6504.26]  This is something we talked about back when we had thought about doing,
[6504.26 --> 6504.80]  you know,
[6504.80 --> 6505.76]  like U2s,
[6505.84 --> 6506.22]  um,
[6506.22 --> 6508.14]  like those little plastic figurines.
[6508.68 --> 6509.10]  Um,
[6509.10 --> 6512.88]  we had thought about contracting a factory to make some of those for us.
[6512.88 --> 6518.20]  And one of the things that we just kind of couldn't get past was who do we do them for?
[6518.42 --> 6525.26]  How do we avoid this turning into like a weird popularity contest where someone gets their feelings hurt because theirs doesn't sell very well or whatever.
[6525.26 --> 6525.88]  And we just like,
[6525.88 --> 6526.38]  forget it.
[6526.44 --> 6527.38]  Just don't do it.
[6527.38 --> 6529.26]  Um,
[6532.26 --> 6533.34]  Adam asks,
[6533.48 --> 6538.58]  how much performance am I leaving on the table at 1440p with a 4790k and a 3070?
[6538.96 --> 6539.38]  I mean,
[6539.44 --> 6539.98]  honestly,
[6540.22 --> 6544.06]  you'd get some benefit from upgrading your CPU at this point,
[6544.12 --> 6545.42]  especially with the new launch,
[6545.98 --> 6549.50]  but you're also not at 1440p.
[6549.60 --> 6551.62]  You're going to be GPU bound in some games.
[6551.76 --> 6553.24]  I don't think it's the end of the world.
[6553.24 --> 6554.76]  I think the,
[6554.76 --> 6555.24]  the,
[6555.36 --> 6557.64]  the honest answer every time someone asks me,
[6557.70 --> 6557.90]  okay,
[6558.34 --> 6559.36]  should I upgrade is,
[6559.96 --> 6560.26]  well,
[6560.28 --> 6561.42]  what's wrong with it?
[6561.78 --> 6562.04]  Right.
[6562.38 --> 6563.82]  Is there some kind of,
[6563.82 --> 6565.42]  of bottleneck that is,
[6565.54 --> 6567.62]  that is hurting your gaming experience in a,
[6567.66 --> 6568.48]  in a meaningful way?
[6568.48 --> 6569.16]  And if not,
[6569.26 --> 6570.40]  then I mean,
[6570.40 --> 6570.66]  there's,
[6570.76 --> 6572.44]  there's no reason to,
[6572.44 --> 6573.20]  um,
[6573.84 --> 6575.94]  just generate more electronic junk,
[6575.94 --> 6576.24]  right?
[6576.64 --> 6578.38]  A 4790k is still a good chip.
[6579.26 --> 6580.04]  It's a good chip.
[6580.12 --> 6580.54]  It's fast.
[6581.66 --> 6582.10]  Uh,
[6582.16 --> 6583.22]  I don't,
[6583.24 --> 6583.90]  share your screen.
[6584.08 --> 6586.78]  I emailed you the desk pad configurator stuff,
[6587.20 --> 6587.46]  um,
[6587.52 --> 6590.64]  download the files and then play them.
[6590.76 --> 6591.20]  Also,
[6591.40 --> 6594.22]  maybe I should watch it first to make sure there isn't anything in there,
[6594.24 --> 6595.10]  but I don't think there is.
[6596.92 --> 6597.36]  Um,
[6597.48 --> 6598.34]  what was I going to say?
[6598.44 --> 6598.66]  This,
[6598.78 --> 6600.86]  this is a very early,
[6600.86 --> 6601.12]  like,
[6601.12 --> 6602.34]  there's a reason why it's,
[6602.48 --> 6604.02]  it's not on the store yet.
[6604.38 --> 6604.86]  Um,
[6605.08 --> 6605.58]  people,
[6605.80 --> 6606.58]  so it's,
[6606.58 --> 6607.78]  it's not perfect yet,
[6607.78 --> 6609.20]  but this is kind of the,
[6609.20 --> 6610.42]  the concept that we're,
[6610.52 --> 6611.54]  that we're going for.
[6612.32 --> 6612.78]  Jaden says,
[6612.86 --> 6614.88]  can you please make shipping cheaper?
[6615.08 --> 6615.52]  Come on.
[6615.58 --> 6616.64]  I want to,
[6616.86 --> 6618.48]  I would love to.
[6618.70 --> 6622.92]  It's just really hard because we don't control shipping prices.
[6622.92 --> 6624.04]  Um,
[6624.04 --> 6628.48]  Haley says,
[6628.56 --> 6629.04]  hi Colton,
[6629.16 --> 6630.02]  among other things.
[6630.46 --> 6630.82]  Hey,
[6630.88 --> 6631.42]  thanks Haley.
[6631.98 --> 6632.34]  Uh,
[6632.40 --> 6634.00]  Lee bought the banana pack.
[6634.12 --> 6634.54]  All right.
[6634.80 --> 6635.48]  The banana bunch,
[6635.52 --> 6636.38]  I guess we could call it.
[6636.38 --> 6637.62]  Um,
[6638.58 --> 6638.92]  Hey,
[6638.98 --> 6639.42]  you're welcome.
[6639.56 --> 6641.34]  Anonymous for the high quality merch.
[6641.86 --> 6642.40]  James says,
[6642.50 --> 6643.28]  it's my birthday.
[6643.38 --> 6644.80]  This is a present to myself.
[6645.10 --> 6648.42]  Got the 1.2 meter by 30 centimeter Northern lights desk pad.
[6648.52 --> 6648.98]  Heck yeah.
[6649.50 --> 6649.66]  Yeah,
[6649.70 --> 6650.10]  it should be fine.
[6650.16 --> 6652.24]  Aiden minus as a user of unraid.
[6652.32 --> 6657.22]  Does it bug you that years on you can't customize the web GUI horizontally?
[6657.48 --> 6657.96]  Oh man.
[6658.22 --> 6659.82]  I love the unraid guys.
[6659.82 --> 6660.44]  They're great,
[6660.58 --> 6661.18]  great people,
[6661.18 --> 6666.02]  but there are many things that bother me that are not fixed after years.
[6666.62 --> 6666.98]  Um,
[6667.38 --> 6667.88]  I love them.
[6667.94 --> 6668.42]  They're wonderful.
[6668.58 --> 6670.00]  Jacob says trans rights,
[6670.16 --> 6671.20]  bought a purple banana.
[6671.46 --> 6671.90]  Heck yeah.
[6672.36 --> 6672.62]  Uh,
[6672.62 --> 6674.82]  Patrick says interesting time with Alder Lake.
[6675.02 --> 6678.90]  I help people with computer problems for free and I recently built my thousandth PC.
[6679.02 --> 6679.14]  Wow.
[6679.20 --> 6680.16]  You keep track of that.
[6680.22 --> 6680.90]  That's pretty cool.
[6681.06 --> 6681.80]  That'd be a cool,
[6681.80 --> 6682.58]  like pretty cool.
[6682.78 --> 6684.96]  What a cool wall collage that would be.
[6684.96 --> 6685.14]  Oh,
[6685.20 --> 6685.82]  a picture of each one.
[6685.84 --> 6688.02]  Like a picture of every computer you've built or something.
[6688.14 --> 6688.80]  That'd be pretty sweet.
[6688.82 --> 6688.94]  Oh,
[6688.98 --> 6690.02]  that'd be so cool.
[6690.02 --> 6692.74]  I wish I had pictures of like the first computer I built and stuff.
[6692.84 --> 6692.90]  I,
[6693.02 --> 6693.56]  there's no,
[6693.94 --> 6694.28]  nothing,
[6694.56 --> 6695.08]  nothing at all.
[6696.04 --> 6697.54]  Looking forward to the S2 tool,
[6697.64 --> 6698.88]  steel bit screwdriver later.
[6699.02 --> 6699.30]  Yeah.
[6699.32 --> 6700.20]  You better believe it.
[6700.90 --> 6701.26]  Uh,
[6701.38 --> 6702.26]  Martin,
[6702.90 --> 6705.48]  I've been watching the WAN show since it was recorded on the couch.
[6706.52 --> 6706.68]  Uh,
[6706.76 --> 6707.84]  that is a lot of shirts.
[6707.90 --> 6711.90]  It's like one of every shirt and a water bottle question back on the couch.
[6711.90 --> 6712.38]  You explained,
[6712.48 --> 6715.00]  you were saying same bad time,
[6715.12 --> 6715.78]  same bad channel.
[6716.08 --> 6716.44]  Ah,
[6716.56 --> 6716.78]  okay.
[6716.88 --> 6717.08]  No,
[6717.16 --> 6718.66]  it was never same bat time,
[6718.78 --> 6719.58]  same bat channel.
[6719.58 --> 6720.96]  Like the old Adam West Batman.
[6721.20 --> 6722.96]  It was always bad time,
[6723.10 --> 6723.78]  bad channel.
[6724.10 --> 6724.30]  Oh wait,
[6724.34 --> 6724.44]  no,
[6724.46 --> 6725.44]  I might've actually said that.
[6725.44 --> 6726.54]  I think I was,
[6726.58 --> 6726.68]  yeah,
[6726.68 --> 6727.56]  I think it was just a reference.
[6727.58 --> 6729.12]  You used to say bat and now you say bad.
[6729.16 --> 6731.10]  Now it's bad because the show is always late.
[6731.34 --> 6731.84]  That's right.
[6731.90 --> 6732.68]  There's your answer.
[6733.04 --> 6733.20]  Yeah.
[6733.20 --> 6733.94]  Um,
[6734.36 --> 6734.74]  and I just,
[6734.82 --> 6735.12]  I like,
[6735.24 --> 6736.04]  I like the reference.
[6736.20 --> 6737.08]  It's funny show.
[6737.08 --> 6738.82]  You actually confused me at one point.
[6738.88 --> 6739.12]  Yeah.
[6739.20 --> 6741.38]  Cause I started realizing you were saying bad and I was like,
[6741.44 --> 6741.60]  wait,
[6741.70 --> 6741.92]  what?
[6742.00 --> 6745.36]  Because I remember this same explanation that Martin is bringing.
[6746.24 --> 6747.64]  Anatoly's comment is,
[6747.64 --> 6751.18]  I would like my purchase to appear as an alert on the LTT stream.
[6751.56 --> 6753.60]  Anatoly mission accomplished.
[6753.60 --> 6754.22]  Got them.
[6755.14 --> 6755.90]  Love it.
[6756.90 --> 6757.46]  Okay.
[6758.26 --> 6758.94]  Um,
[6759.02 --> 6759.96]  new constellation shirt.
[6760.04 --> 6761.12]  When asks Zach,
[6761.26 --> 6761.86]  I know,
[6761.94 --> 6762.26]  I know.
[6762.26 --> 6766.92]  So we have our first shipment of our own t-shirts,
[6767.14 --> 6768.64]  not American apparel ones.
[6768.82 --> 6773.12]  We're taking it slow on this because the quality of our shirts is one of the
[6773.12 --> 6774.74]  things that people rave about.
[6774.78 --> 6778.20]  And it's so funny because they're just American apparel tees.
[6778.38 --> 6782.52]  It's just that every other merch shirt uses garbage t-shirts.
[6782.90 --> 6783.02]  Yeah.
[6783.02 --> 6785.24]  That's the only reason ours stand out.
[6785.32 --> 6787.38]  These are just off the shelf American apparel tees.
[6787.50 --> 6790.52]  But the problem we have with them is that we can't get enough supply.
[6790.52 --> 6793.24]  Otherwise we would have just continued to buy American apparel.
[6793.44 --> 6797.62]  So we've been trying to find our own shirts that match or exceed the quality
[6797.62 --> 6798.32]  of American apparel.
[6798.40 --> 6799.18]  We think we have it.
[6799.24 --> 6800.50]  We did a volume order,
[6800.72 --> 6802.14]  but we're,
[6802.18 --> 6803.56]  we're taking a look at them.
[6803.64 --> 6804.84]  We're doing test prints.
[6805.00 --> 6807.52]  It's going to take some time when we're done.
[6807.98 --> 6810.68]  We're going to have black aqua ish as a color.
[6810.82 --> 6811.00]  Again,
[6811.04 --> 6812.60]  we are going to bring back constellation.
[6812.92 --> 6815.54]  I don't know if it'll be a V2 or if we'll do the original design,
[6815.60 --> 6817.42]  at least as one run for people who missed it,
[6817.42 --> 6818.82]  but it's going to happen.
[6818.82 --> 6819.52]  It's going to happen.
[6820.52 --> 6821.06]  Thanks,
[6821.14 --> 6821.44]  Andrew.
[6823.24 --> 6824.28]  Oh my gosh.
[6824.58 --> 6826.64]  They're coming in faster than I can read them.
[6826.68 --> 6829.94]  Do you want to bring up the configurator and I'll keep firing through these?
[6830.54 --> 6831.52]  What number are you on?
[6831.72 --> 6833.02]  I'm on 62.
[6833.54 --> 6833.78]  Okay.
[6836.18 --> 6838.46]  We're going to have to start doing this as like an after party,
[6838.54 --> 6838.82]  I think.
[6840.30 --> 6840.66]  Maybe.
[6840.84 --> 6845.40]  So we just cut the show and then we like come right back and we're like,
[6845.54 --> 6845.72]  Hey,
[6845.76 --> 6846.12]  let's,
[6846.32 --> 6848.38]  let's go through like Q and a and stuff on YouTube.
[6848.38 --> 6848.70]  Maybe.
[6848.82 --> 6849.10]  I don't know.
[6849.12 --> 6849.34]  Yeah.
[6849.34 --> 6849.86]  Something like that.
[6849.90 --> 6850.60]  With that said,
[6850.98 --> 6853.08]  retention on this is actually like excellent.
[6853.14 --> 6854.92]  We are answering questions that people might be interested in.
[6855.08 --> 6855.20]  Like,
[6855.44 --> 6855.86]  yeah,
[6855.92 --> 6857.62]  it's kind of a Q and a at the end of the show.
[6857.72 --> 6857.88]  Like,
[6857.92 --> 6858.22]  I don't know.
[6858.30 --> 6858.88]  It might be fine.
[6858.88 --> 6863.02]  This is my first LTT purchase since the keep on digging shirt a few years back.
[6863.12 --> 6864.36]  I think it's a little more than a few years back.
[6864.74 --> 6866.76]  That was like seven years ago.
[6868.18 --> 6872.56]  I've been a big fan since 2014 and I have watched most WAN shows since then.
[6872.72 --> 6872.96]  Epic.
[6873.28 --> 6873.50]  Nice.
[6875.08 --> 6875.48]  No,
[6875.54 --> 6876.32]  it was Ubisoft.
[6877.48 --> 6878.42]  The keep on digging.
[6878.52 --> 6878.68]  Yeah.
[6878.90 --> 6879.08]  Yeah.
[6879.12 --> 6879.38]  Okay.
[6879.38 --> 6881.26]  I've got Luke's thingamaboober here.
[6881.50 --> 6881.82]  Don't.
[6882.06 --> 6883.04]  Is that the email?
[6883.62 --> 6884.06]  No,
[6884.10 --> 6884.62]  you download it.
[6884.74 --> 6885.36]  Thank you.
[6885.36 --> 6885.80]  Okay.
[6886.20 --> 6886.70]  So again,
[6887.18 --> 6888.62]  extremely early version.
[6888.76 --> 6890.02]  This is mostly proof of concept.
[6890.16 --> 6891.28]  It is not going to look like this.
[6891.34 --> 6895.32]  It will have a better user experience UI kind of set up thing.
[6895.36 --> 6896.44]  We're just showing that you can,
[6896.56 --> 6900.48]  you can change the size of the desk to,
[6900.48 --> 6901.64]  to like an,
[6901.64 --> 6902.46]  an input amount.
[6902.46 --> 6905.80]  So you can input the size of your desk and it will change the,
[6905.80 --> 6907.24]  the canvas to,
[6907.36 --> 6909.84]  to kind of work for the size of desk that you have.
[6910.24 --> 6911.56]  How'd you put the keyboard and mouse in?
[6913.32 --> 6913.50]  Hmm.
[6913.74 --> 6915.12]  How'd you put the keyboard and mouse in?
[6915.36 --> 6916.34]  I don't see a keyboard and mouse.
[6916.46 --> 6917.04]  There's a keyboard.
[6917.36 --> 6917.48]  Oh,
[6917.54 --> 6918.26]  on the mouse pad.
[6918.40 --> 6918.56]  Oh,
[6918.56 --> 6919.94]  is that just part of the mouse pad image?
[6920.40 --> 6921.08]  I think so.
[6921.20 --> 6921.50]  Got it.
[6921.60 --> 6921.76]  Yeah.
[6921.92 --> 6922.12]  Okay.
[6922.16 --> 6922.60]  That makes sense.
[6922.62 --> 6922.82]  So we're,
[6922.88 --> 6923.02]  we're,
[6923.16 --> 6925.10]  I think I've requested it,
[6925.16 --> 6927.50]  but it's like on the office server.
[6927.62 --> 6928.62]  So I keep forgetting to get it.
[6928.62 --> 6931.02]  We're supposed to get like the source images for the mouse pad so that it
[6931.02 --> 6933.26]  looks better and stuff and it will look nicer,
[6933.46 --> 6933.50]  blah,
[6933.50 --> 6933.60]  blah,
[6933.60 --> 6933.72]  blah,
[6933.82 --> 6933.84]  blah,
[6933.84 --> 6933.92]  blah.
[6934.00 --> 6938.84]  But the idea is you can put in the dimensions of your desk and then trial a
[6938.84 --> 6942.40]  bunch of official sizes of the mouse pad to figure out exactly what
[6942.40 --> 6943.38]  mouse pad you want the most.
[6943.52 --> 6944.22]  So it'll look nice.
[6944.24 --> 6944.74]  It'll work better,
[6944.74 --> 6945.10]  et cetera.
[6945.18 --> 6947.22]  But that functionality is coming to the store,
[6947.28 --> 6948.28]  which I think is going to be great.
[6949.06 --> 6949.22]  Oh,
[6949.22 --> 6951.06]  it's a screenshot from the LTD store.
[6951.26 --> 6953.14]  So we're going to get better versions.
[6953.20 --> 6953.40]  Again,
[6953.44 --> 6954.66]  it's a very early version of that,
[6954.76 --> 6955.32]  that stuff.
[6955.90 --> 6956.52]  Got it.
[6958.00 --> 6958.40]  Um,
[6958.72 --> 6959.32]  okay.
[6960.64 --> 6961.04]  Benjamin,
[6961.16 --> 6963.28]  I really went the WAN hoodie.
[6963.52 --> 6963.76]  Hey,
[6963.98 --> 6964.34]  thanks,
[6964.44 --> 6964.78]  Benjamin.
[6968.28 --> 6968.68]  Note,
[6968.74 --> 6968.94]  note,
[6969.00 --> 6969.28]  notey,
[6969.32 --> 6969.76]  McNote,
[6969.84 --> 6970.04]  note,
[6970.14 --> 6970.80]  Luke is awesome.
[6970.90 --> 6971.52]  Says Justin.
[6971.72 --> 6972.02]  Thanks.
[6972.12 --> 6973.84]  You know what we might have to do?
[6974.74 --> 6981.22]  A better way to tackle this might be to just have a live producer filtering them
[6981.22 --> 6985.00]  and then just have the messages be part of the merge message and just have it pop up.
[6985.10 --> 6990.44]  As long as we've got a character limit and we design a thing that like has bounds that
[6990.44 --> 6991.28]  kind of make sense.
[6991.28 --> 6992.80]  that does get,
[6992.80 --> 6993.50]  um,
[6993.50 --> 6994.32]  more complicated.
[6994.62 --> 6994.94]  Uh,
[6994.94 --> 7000.78]  they could also pull like specific kind of questions that we could answer at the end of the show out and stuff like that.
[7000.84 --> 7001.16]  Yeah.
[7001.44 --> 7001.74]  Yeah.
[7001.96 --> 7004.40]  The problem with adding a producer to this show though,
[7004.40 --> 7007.14]  is that it kind of happens on such a,
[7007.14 --> 7007.60]  um,
[7007.62 --> 7008.46]  random schedule.
[7008.46 --> 7009.82]  Like nobody's in office right now.
[7009.86 --> 7011.20]  Luke and I are the only ones in the building.
[7011.20 --> 7013.50]  I don't think anyone wants to stay.
[7013.82 --> 7014.26]  Um,
[7014.74 --> 7018.46]  anonymous says the top handle on that backpack prototype looks thin padding.
[7018.58 --> 7018.88]  Maybe.
[7019.54 --> 7020.42]  Oh no,
[7020.56 --> 7020.76]  no,
[7020.82 --> 7020.96]  no,
[7020.96 --> 7021.24]  no.
[7021.76 --> 7022.14]  Okay.
[7022.82 --> 7023.30]  Thin.
[7023.42 --> 7023.76]  Maybe,
[7023.88 --> 7024.28]  maybe,
[7024.68 --> 7026.54]  but it is strong.
[7027.20 --> 7027.64]  Um,
[7027.64 --> 7033.24]  it is double layered and then just has like stitching down the middle for absolute lols because we were like,
[7033.48 --> 7034.26]  add more stitching.
[7034.26 --> 7036.50]  It is not going anywhere.
[7037.32 --> 7038.02]  Jacob says,
[7038.18 --> 7039.66]  Jay loves K very much.
[7039.74 --> 7039.96]  Hey,
[7040.24 --> 7043.52]  we're doing the like romantic shout outs on the WAN show now.
[7044.40 --> 7046.60]  Congratulations on popping your LTT store cherry,
[7046.72 --> 7047.06]  Micah.
[7047.48 --> 7047.92]  Um,
[7048.34 --> 7049.16]  Josiah says,
[7049.20 --> 7051.34]  have you done a video to build a mid range server?
[7051.52 --> 7052.92]  We actually have one coming soon.
[7052.92 --> 7056.32]  That's going to be about repurposing your old desktop to make it into a server.
[7056.54 --> 7058.24]  I think Pulseway sponsored it.
[7058.36 --> 7058.98]  So that's cool.
[7060.14 --> 7060.96]  Anatin says,
[7060.96 --> 7062.04]  shout out to my girlfriend,
[7062.46 --> 7063.30]  Sarmishta,
[7063.30 --> 7065.72]  who loved the look of the gold water bottle.
[7066.06 --> 7066.46]  Heck yeah.
[7067.02 --> 7068.00]  And includes,
[7068.16 --> 7068.36]  uh,
[7068.36 --> 7068.52]  Oh,
[7068.62 --> 7071.08]  a gold black and gold water bottle for the GF.
[7071.18 --> 7071.74]  Love it.
[7073.72 --> 7074.52]  Ashley says,
[7074.62 --> 7075.68]  take my money.
[7076.00 --> 7077.92]  I will buy a fully loaded backpack.
[7078.18 --> 7081.54]  My expectation would be 200 to 300 USD for such a package.
[7081.76 --> 7083.80]  I can give you guys some pricing guidance.
[7083.80 --> 7085.94]  Now that we've done this latest sample,
[7086.14 --> 7086.38]  uh,
[7086.38 --> 7087.58]  there's going to be a few more changes,
[7087.58 --> 7092.76]  but you can expect that the backpack will probably be in the neighborhood of 250 US dollars.
[7092.76 --> 7093.86]  It is not going to be cheap.
[7093.86 --> 7094.64]  It's just for the backpack.
[7094.86 --> 7095.98]  So the fully loaded bundle,
[7096.06 --> 7096.96]  if that became a thing,
[7097.18 --> 7098.14]  it could be around 300.
[7098.24 --> 7101.28]  I think we could offer some bundle savings if it was like a shirt.
[7101.42 --> 7101.58]  Oh,
[7101.62 --> 7102.32]  not the screwdriver.
[7102.66 --> 7103.10]  Water.
[7103.40 --> 7105.06]  No cost on the screwdriver is rough.
[7105.60 --> 7105.92]  Okay.
[7106.30 --> 7106.50]  Yeah.
[7106.50 --> 7110.16]  Maybe like water bottle and a shirt would be the package that we could do.
[7110.16 --> 7110.92]  Might be a little bit more reasonable.
[7111.10 --> 7111.62]  So let's,
[7111.66 --> 7112.62]  let's see what we can do.
[7112.74 --> 7113.88]  But the,
[7114.14 --> 7116.02]  so far the people that I've shown it to,
[7116.08 --> 7117.18]  and that includes Brandon,
[7117.42 --> 7117.72]  David,
[7117.72 --> 7118.78]  and Colin,
[7119.52 --> 7119.98]  um,
[7120.50 --> 7122.30]  some of them in particular,
[7122.30 --> 7122.84]  actually,
[7122.84 --> 7128.32]  I think all of them have really nice backpacks that they have spent a lot of money on.
[7128.36 --> 7128.86]  And they're like,
[7128.86 --> 7132.58]  pretty good.
[7132.58 --> 7133.22]  Looks good.
[7133.34 --> 7133.48]  Yeah.
[7133.62 --> 7134.14]  Um,
[7134.14 --> 7135.34]  nice backpacks are really expensive.
[7135.34 --> 7138.04]  Like genuinely really good backpacks are very expensive.
[7138.30 --> 7138.94]  Brandon says,
[7139.10 --> 7140.02]  banana.
[7141.46 --> 7142.04]  All right.
[7142.06 --> 7142.30]  Thanks,
[7142.36 --> 7142.62]  Brandon.
[7142.96 --> 7143.86]  It's a different Brandon,
[7143.96 --> 7144.52]  not our Brandon,
[7144.68 --> 7145.52]  but yeah.
[7145.82 --> 7146.18]  Um,
[7146.18 --> 7146.48]  Martin,
[7146.62 --> 7150.12]  can we get a video about the difference between MSRP and retail prices?
[7150.24 --> 7152.22]  So many people are fighting and getting ripped off,
[7152.30 --> 7153.42]  ripped off because nobody knows.
[7153.50 --> 7153.66]  Yeah.
[7153.70 --> 7154.02]  I mean,
[7154.02 --> 7155.32]  I don't think that's a whole video,
[7155.48 --> 7161.20]  but MSRP is a suggested retail price and retail prices are just like the price.
[7161.20 --> 7162.50]  So that's,
[7162.56 --> 7163.44]  that's the big difference.
[7163.78 --> 7164.22]  Um,
[7164.68 --> 7166.76]  got the wife to watch the show with me.
[7166.88 --> 7170.50]  She saw the bananas and had to have them says Robert.
[7171.10 --> 7171.74]  You know,
[7171.78 --> 7176.18]  what's funny is I can't remember if it was Nick or Sarah or both of them.
[7176.50 --> 7178.68]  I pushed back on the bananas.
[7179.08 --> 7180.00]  I was like,
[7180.20 --> 7181.62]  I don't know.
[7181.72 --> 7181.84]  I,
[7182.06 --> 7183.26]  this is kind of like a weird,
[7183.60 --> 7184.74]  a weird product to me.
[7184.78 --> 7187.66]  Like I know banana for scale is like a total meme and everything,
[7187.66 --> 7192.10]  but it's not one that we've leaned crazy heavy into or anything like that.
[7192.38 --> 7192.54]  No.
[7192.86 --> 7193.50]  And they were like,
[7193.62 --> 7194.34]  no man,
[7194.66 --> 7195.30]  trust me.
[7195.60 --> 7196.06]  I was like,
[7196.10 --> 7196.68]  okay.
[7196.84 --> 7197.36]  All right.
[7197.74 --> 7198.10]  Honestly,
[7198.18 --> 7198.50]  when I,
[7198.60 --> 7199.28]  when I saw these,
[7199.36 --> 7199.56]  we had,
[7199.56 --> 7200.26]  we had to do some,
[7200.40 --> 7201.70]  Philippine had to do a little bit of work to,
[7201.80 --> 7203.22]  to make the bundle thing work.
[7203.30 --> 7203.58]  Right.
[7203.72 --> 7204.00]  Uh,
[7204.00 --> 7205.02]  when I saw these and like,
[7205.10 --> 7205.74]  I know nothing,
[7205.80 --> 7206.68]  I'm not the merch guy.
[7206.68 --> 7207.04]  Right.
[7207.28 --> 7207.46]  Like,
[7207.46 --> 7208.20]  don't listen to me,
[7208.24 --> 7209.40]  but I saw this and I was like,
[7209.46 --> 7209.72]  wow,
[7209.92 --> 7213.14]  I hope we didn't buy a ton of them,
[7213.18 --> 7216.12]  but now I kind of hope they did buy a ton of them.
[7216.30 --> 7216.62]  Yeah.
[7216.76 --> 7218.02]  Apparently they're flying off.
[7218.18 --> 7219.34]  Cause if we didn't buy a ton of them,
[7219.38 --> 7220.44]  we're in big trouble.
[7220.70 --> 7221.06]  Yeah.
[7221.42 --> 7224.24]  The amount of people that are buying all of them.
[7225.26 --> 7225.62]  Yeah.
[7225.68 --> 7226.92]  It's really interesting to me too.
[7227.36 --> 7227.56]  I,
[7227.60 --> 7229.42]  I think there's like just as many or,
[7229.42 --> 7229.70]  or,
[7229.70 --> 7234.00]  or maybe even more people that are buying the entire set of bananas than just one of them.
[7234.24 --> 7234.62]  All right.
[7234.76 --> 7235.12]  Um,
[7235.12 --> 7235.60]  no problem.
[7235.88 --> 7236.20]  Ari,
[7236.98 --> 7237.56]  uh,
[7237.64 --> 7237.86]  rune,
[7237.92 --> 7239.12]  I guess I accidentally,
[7239.12 --> 7239.78]  um,
[7240.26 --> 7242.68]  I accidentally answered your question already.
[7242.86 --> 7243.24]  Ha ha.
[7243.98 --> 7244.30]  Uh,
[7244.30 --> 7246.66]  Renee greetings from Chile following your channel for years.
[7248.94 --> 7249.38]  Oh,
[7249.50 --> 7249.74]  Oh,
[7249.96 --> 7250.52]  Jono.
[7250.80 --> 7251.98]  Jono just messaged me.
[7252.06 --> 7252.34]  Whoa,
[7252.46 --> 7252.70]  Whoa,
[7252.84 --> 7253.18]  Whoa.
[7253.40 --> 7254.58]  It was me.
[7255.32 --> 7255.92]  All right.
[7256.00 --> 7256.50]  All right.
[7256.60 --> 7259.06]  Jono's apparently wanted the banana since like 2018.
[7259.06 --> 7259.98]  So there you go.
[7260.22 --> 7260.82]  There you go.
[7260.86 --> 7263.26]  We got to give credit where credit is due.
[7263.94 --> 7266.16]  Michael says old guy with poor eyesight.
[7266.38 --> 7268.86]  What's the best monitor type slash technology?
[7269.12 --> 7270.52]  For poor eyesight.
[7270.80 --> 7271.14]  Wow.
[7271.80 --> 7273.12]  That is a good question.
[7273.24 --> 7273.58]  I mean,
[7273.66 --> 7276.14]  I want to say garbage in garbage out.
[7276.24 --> 7279.86]  You're going to want to make sure that you get a monitor with like a really fine,
[7280.00 --> 7280.84]  uh,
[7281.10 --> 7281.64]  uh,
[7281.64 --> 7281.80]  with,
[7282.12 --> 7282.50]  uh,
[7282.50 --> 7283.58]  with high pixel density.
[7283.58 --> 7285.22]  But other than that,
[7285.22 --> 7286.40]  I could see,
[7286.52 --> 7290.94]  I could see avoiding something that inherently has more glow.
[7291.08 --> 7292.92]  You might not like an IPS as much.
[7294.04 --> 7296.90]  The thing is that part of the glow effect though,
[7296.90 --> 7298.12]  is actually,
[7298.12 --> 7298.86]  um,
[7298.86 --> 7300.76]  the way that your eyes take in light.
[7300.76 --> 7301.98]  So even OLEDs,
[7302.04 --> 7305.90]  which might have a pixel off and then pixel on right next to each other,
[7305.94 --> 7307.80]  they can still have a perceived glow to them.
[7308.04 --> 7308.40]  So also,
[7308.76 --> 7308.96]  I,
[7309.44 --> 7309.82]  again,
[7310.04 --> 7311.26]  know nothing on this topic.
[7311.26 --> 7313.08]  I would maybe recommend not an OLED,
[7313.74 --> 7314.00]  uh,
[7314.00 --> 7314.48]  because I,
[7314.52 --> 7318.46]  I think the difference between it might actually make things hard to see.
[7319.46 --> 7319.90]  Yeah.
[7319.90 --> 7322.62]  But then you're also not going to want no contrast.
[7322.74 --> 7325.84]  You're not going to want a TN either because that's going to be really hard to deal with.
[7325.92 --> 7326.02]  Yeah.
[7326.02 --> 7326.54]  It's just garbage.
[7326.70 --> 7327.10]  I mean,
[7327.60 --> 7328.04]  honestly,
[7328.04 --> 7331.26]  I'm not educated enough to make a solid recommendation there.
[7331.98 --> 7332.42]  Um,
[7333.36 --> 7335.22]  but if I had to guess,
[7335.26 --> 7338.02]  I would say a happy medium might be something VA based.
[7338.84 --> 7339.94]  If I had to guess,
[7340.02 --> 7340.60]  I'm guessing,
[7340.94 --> 7341.34]  guessing,
[7341.54 --> 7342.22]  guessing Linus.
[7343.02 --> 7343.46]  Uh,
[7343.52 --> 7346.46]  Jacob says there's a category literally called hard in the store.
[7346.80 --> 7347.86]  LTT condoms confirmed.
[7348.26 --> 7349.74]  I do not want that liability.
[7349.90 --> 7352.34]  There's no way.
[7352.48 --> 7353.42]  There's no way.
[7353.62 --> 7353.92]  Yeah.
[7354.70 --> 7355.14]  Ah,
[7355.28 --> 7355.70]  anonymous.
[7356.08 --> 7356.44]  Wow.
[7356.68 --> 7357.98]  Got to kick me while I'm down.
[7358.10 --> 7362.22]  I saw on the WAN show a while back that you thought the gold Xbox controller videos would go viral,
[7362.54 --> 7363.10]  man.
[7363.22 --> 7367.96]  You should have just made another RC firetruck review would have been 10 mil views.
[7368.12 --> 7368.56]  Easy.
[7369.98 --> 7371.04]  You should try to,
[7371.54 --> 7377.46]  you should try to find like the coolest RC firetruck video and make like a number two.
[7378.40 --> 7378.88]  Um,
[7378.88 --> 7379.58]  I have,
[7379.58 --> 7383.16]  I have some ideas for like a followup to that.
[7383.38 --> 7384.10]  Nothing solid.
[7384.20 --> 7385.04]  Nothing solid though.
[7386.00 --> 7386.88]  Nice new shirts.
[7387.08 --> 7389.04]  Thanks for occupying 80% of my wardrobe.
[7389.04 --> 7389.36]  I should,
[7389.36 --> 7390.16]  I should film it.
[7390.22 --> 7392.36]  He just to complete the,
[7392.48 --> 7393.24]  just for the memes.
[7393.24 --> 7393.48]  Yeah.
[7393.54 --> 7394.12]  I love it.
[7394.12 --> 7395.86]  Um,
[7395.92 --> 7398.14]  Bridget says my lid broke for my 21 ounce.
[7398.24 --> 7398.40]  Oh,
[7398.46 --> 7399.10]  got a new lid.
[7399.10 --> 7399.80]  I see that.
[7400.50 --> 7400.90]  Um,
[7401.18 --> 7401.46]  man,
[7401.46 --> 7405.46]  we've had some of those out there so long that like it is.
[7405.46 --> 7407.44]  The like spine connector on the lid.
[7407.44 --> 7407.46]  Yeah.
[7407.46 --> 7409.04]  We're starting to really old.
[7409.04 --> 7412.88]  We're starting to see people with that amount of movement on it after years of,
[7412.96 --> 7414.26]  if potentially daily use.
[7414.34 --> 7414.44]  Yeah.
[7414.50 --> 7414.60]  Yeah.
[7414.60 --> 7414.98]  I see it.
[7415.66 --> 7416.14]  Um,
[7416.14 --> 7416.98]  but,
[7416.98 --> 7417.34]  uh,
[7417.34 --> 7419.06]  Bridget's picked up one of the new spout lids,
[7419.18 --> 7420.52]  got the do not drop t-shirt,
[7420.60 --> 7421.54]  got a yellow banana.
[7422.00 --> 7422.44]  Also,
[7422.52 --> 7424.38]  when are women sizes and cuts coming to LTE store?
[7424.48 --> 7424.66]  Okay.
[7424.66 --> 7426.94]  We are working on it.
[7427.04 --> 7434.96]  So step one is getting t-shirts and long sleeves of our own design with our own materials that we're happy with.
[7435.40 --> 7436.66]  Once we do that,
[7437.02 --> 7441.00]  step two is working on our female cuts,
[7441.44 --> 7444.04]  our lanky boy and chunky boy cuts.
[7444.60 --> 7445.16]  Um,
[7445.52 --> 7448.42]  probably figuring out alternative female cuts.
[7448.52 --> 7449.64]  Like we've got a whole roadmap.
[7449.96 --> 7453.68]  We really want to make sure that not only for LTT merch,
[7453.68 --> 7460.84]  but in the longterm creator warehouse wants to open up to being a merch provider for other creators as well.
[7460.84 --> 7466.28]  So we want to figure out how to have like crazy inclusive sizing.
[7466.56 --> 7466.88]  Uh,
[7466.88 --> 7469.56]  that's just one of our sort of longterm goals.
[7469.82 --> 7470.12]  And,
[7470.20 --> 7470.54]  um,
[7471.16 --> 7471.70]  we're going to,
[7471.90 --> 7472.82]  at some point,
[7472.88 --> 7473.08]  it's not,
[7473.18 --> 7473.74]  hasn't happened yet,
[7473.76 --> 7474.20]  but it will,
[7474.36 --> 7476.78]  we're going to reach out to our community to kind of,
[7477.22 --> 7477.64]  um,
[7478.24 --> 7479.90]  to join the Guinea pig squad.
[7480.42 --> 7483.66]  And we'll take community feedback on all these,
[7483.68 --> 7484.62]  like different sizes,
[7484.62 --> 7487.98]  because that's one of the things that's really challenging for men's clothes.
[7488.46 --> 7489.14]  Just like,
[7489.16 --> 7490.38]  you've got enough dudes,
[7490.90 --> 7491.12]  you know,
[7491.12 --> 7495.94]  like tech bros in this building that is pretty easy to find like a lanky boy or,
[7496.06 --> 7496.26]  uh,
[7496.38 --> 7497.84]  or heavy boy to,
[7497.92 --> 7499.06]  to try something on and,
[7499.06 --> 7500.88]  and give feedback to the fit technicians.
[7500.88 --> 7501.36]  But,
[7501.36 --> 7502.28]  um,
[7502.34 --> 7503.74]  for female cuts,
[7503.74 --> 7504.14]  we,
[7504.14 --> 7504.18]  we,
[7504.18 --> 7505.18]  we don't,
[7505.18 --> 7508.52]  we don't have the kind of variety of body shapes that we would need.
[7508.52 --> 7509.14]  So we're going to,
[7509.22 --> 7510.32]  we're going to have to figure that out.
[7510.74 --> 7511.70]  It's going to be challenging,
[7511.70 --> 7512.38]  but we will,
[7512.54 --> 7513.28]  we will do it.
[7513.40 --> 7514.50]  It's just a matter of time.
[7514.50 --> 7517.96]  And if you guys watch the framework laptop investment video,
[7517.96 --> 7521.94]  you'll know that one of the big challenges with physical goods is that you have to keep,
[7522.02 --> 7523.18]  whenever you do new product development,
[7523.18 --> 7529.92]  you are pouring in money that is way more than you can hope to extract from the product that you're going to,
[7530.00 --> 7531.98]  to sell for months.
[7531.98 --> 7533.78]  And if your sales volumes increase,
[7533.78 --> 7541.84]  the amount of money that you have to put in could actually be net bigger than the profit that you're making selling through all your product.
[7542.40 --> 7542.64]  So,
[7542.64 --> 7543.12]  uh,
[7543.18 --> 7545.42]  Yvonne and I were actually looking at this the other day,
[7546.48 --> 7553.02]  net cashflow LTT store is way more than a million dollars in the hole this year.
[7553.18 --> 7556.74]  We sell every product profitably,
[7556.74 --> 7560.56]  but you're like setting up more stuff and scaling up.
[7560.56 --> 7565.40]  We are constantly developing new products that we have to pay sampling fees for.
[7565.54 --> 7566.52]  We have to pay deposits.
[7566.52 --> 7567.80]  We have to order them.
[7567.90 --> 7571.24]  Sometimes they can take literally months to arrive.
[7572.28 --> 7572.40]  And,
[7572.40 --> 7573.52]  um,
[7574.16 --> 7575.56]  then when it's time to reorder,
[7575.68 --> 7576.30]  like WAN hoodie.
[7576.88 --> 7577.18]  Okay.
[7577.38 --> 7578.70]  WAN hoodie is such a great example.
[7578.86 --> 7580.30]  So let's use nice round numbers.
[7580.30 --> 7580.88]  And let's,
[7580.98 --> 7581.72]  let's say,
[7582.26 --> 7582.56]  uh,
[7582.56 --> 7584.32]  let's say our profit was 50%.
[7584.32 --> 7585.46]  Let's say it was,
[7585.46 --> 7585.86]  um,
[7585.86 --> 7587.64]  it's really not that simple,
[7587.64 --> 7587.94]  but,
[7588.46 --> 7588.90]  um,
[7589.04 --> 7589.54]  WAN hoodie,
[7589.54 --> 7593.96]  if we ordered 4,000 units and we sold through them in 10 days,
[7593.96 --> 7594.58]  uh,
[7594.76 --> 7600.58]  I guess we'll probably be up to about 11 or 12 days by the time the last unit goes off the shelf in the last size.
[7601.12 --> 7601.60]  Um,
[7602.22 --> 7610.04]  that tells us that between production time being like four to six weeks and shipping time being another six to eight weeks,
[7610.04 --> 7616.62]  that we need to now reorder 15 times as many,
[7616.62 --> 7618.74]  or 12 times as many.
[7619.06 --> 7620.26]  So let's say,
[7620.38 --> 7622.78]  let's say we were making 50% margin,
[7622.90 --> 7623.52]  which again,
[7623.66 --> 7625.68]  I'm only using that for nice round numbers.
[7625.68 --> 7627.48]  we are now dumping in,
[7627.48 --> 7628.98]  um,
[7629.52 --> 7632.28]  11 times more profit than we made.
[7632.52 --> 7632.96]  Yeah.
[7633.12 --> 7635.20]  Just in order to restock this bloody product.
[7635.34 --> 7636.30]  So it's like,
[7636.34 --> 7636.66]  I'm not,
[7636.72 --> 7637.90]  I'm not asking for any sympathy.
[7637.90 --> 7638.62]  It's great.
[7638.68 --> 7642.40]  You guys are amazing and supportive and LTT store has been amazing.
[7642.40 --> 7644.30]  And the team is amazing and everything is,
[7644.40 --> 7645.14]  everything's great.
[7645.14 --> 7645.68]  It's like,
[7646.16 --> 7646.56]  um,
[7646.56 --> 7648.38]  it's been a total game changer for us,
[7648.42 --> 7648.74]  man.
[7648.82 --> 7649.62]  We've got a,
[7649.68 --> 7652.92]  we've got a hiring video coming out soon and we're going to be showing off a new space.
[7653.36 --> 7653.80]  Um,
[7653.80 --> 7654.82]  we're going to bring in,
[7654.88 --> 7657.30]  I want to really lean into engineers.
[7658.02 --> 7658.44]  Oh,
[7658.64 --> 7661.70]  the accounting department asked me to shout out the accounting position again.
[7662.02 --> 7662.46]  Guys,
[7662.52 --> 7663.96]  if you have an accounting background,
[7664.56 --> 7665.14]  um,
[7665.60 --> 7666.88]  please go check out,
[7666.88 --> 7667.40]  um,
[7668.06 --> 7669.44]  linusmediagroup.com.
[7669.44 --> 7671.16]  We've got a position posted there.
[7672.34 --> 7672.70]  Anyway,
[7672.90 --> 7673.92]  the point is we've,
[7674.08 --> 7675.62]  I want to really lean into,
[7675.62 --> 7676.26]  uh,
[7676.26 --> 7677.22]  more engineers,
[7677.74 --> 7679.56]  bringing in more engineers for our staff,
[7679.62 --> 7680.20]  um,
[7680.36 --> 7682.04]  with that upcoming hiring video.
[7682.32 --> 7691.10]  And I think that it is fair to say that LTT store and the support that you guys are showing is going to be a huge part of what's going to allow us to do that.
[7691.16 --> 7693.68]  Obviously it hasn't generated positive cashflow for us yet,
[7693.68 --> 7695.28]  but it will.
[7695.28 --> 7699.34]  And it gives me the confidence to invest and hire these additional people and like,
[7699.44 --> 7700.02]  get this,
[7700.12 --> 7700.78]  get this thing going.
[7701.14 --> 7702.44]  Have you filmed that video yet?
[7702.50 --> 7702.96]  I haven't yet.
[7703.10 --> 7703.30]  Okay.
[7703.68 --> 7705.32]  I want to make sure that the postings are right.
[7706.40 --> 7706.84]  Um,
[7707.44 --> 7708.22]  Preston says,
[7708.30 --> 7708.38]  Hey,
[7708.40 --> 7708.80]  quick question.
[7708.86 --> 7713.48]  I got water bottle V2 and I had to buy another lid after a week because the handle hinge part of the cap shears.
[7713.98 --> 7715.86]  So we haven't had a lot of complaints about that,
[7715.88 --> 7717.34]  but you shouldn't have bought another one.
[7717.40 --> 7718.82]  You should have contacted customer support.
[7718.90 --> 7720.02]  They will send you another one.
[7720.40 --> 7720.74]  Um,
[7720.74 --> 7721.18]  they,
[7721.38 --> 7723.02]  they really do a great job.
[7723.02 --> 7725.14]  Their priority is making sure that everyone's happy.
[7725.14 --> 7726.32]  So what I want you to do,
[7726.36 --> 7731.50]  Preston is reach out to support and get that order refunded for the replacement lid.
[7732.02 --> 7732.32]  Um,
[7732.54 --> 7735.94]  cause customer support's got to know if we have like a quality control,
[7735.94 --> 7736.50]  uh,
[7736.56 --> 7737.18]  issue on a,
[7737.26 --> 7739.06]  on a particular batch of water bottles as well,
[7739.06 --> 7740.62]  so that we can track that kind of thing.
[7740.68 --> 7743.58]  That's how we tracked down the recall that we ultimately did on,
[7743.70 --> 7743.80]  Oh,
[7743.84 --> 7747.02]  I'm not actually wearing it on V1 of the two Kerbini.
[7748.88 --> 7749.32]  Um,
[7749.72 --> 7755.52]  anonymous says award for the world's longest shipping from the lower mainland to the faraway world of the lower mainland.
[7755.64 --> 7755.80]  Okay.
[7756.70 --> 7762.80]  One of these days I will explain how our shipping system works and it is optimized for global logistics
[7762.80 --> 7766.82]  because most of our products ship globally,
[7767.06 --> 7768.22]  not domestically.
[7768.22 --> 7771.38]  And it does slow down our domestic shipping.
[7772.10 --> 7772.88]  I'm sorry.
[7773.38 --> 7775.38]  We do need to keep going through these or,
[7775.50 --> 7776.38]  or like end it.
[7776.52 --> 7778.74]  Hamish says buying this book for my baby boy Caden.
[7779.04 --> 7779.58]  Heck yeah.
[7780.50 --> 7780.90]  Um,
[7781.12 --> 7781.40]  okay.
[7781.50 --> 7781.78]  Yeah.
[7781.82 --> 7782.30]  I'm sorry,
[7782.36 --> 7782.66]  guys.
[7782.72 --> 7783.62]  We're going to have to,
[7783.62 --> 7786.98]  we're going to have to call it here pretty quick unless I see some ones that are like,
[7788.00 --> 7788.28]  uh,
[7788.30 --> 7788.68]  really,
[7789.34 --> 7789.96]  um,
[7789.98 --> 7792.60]  like a good question that people really need the answer to.
[7792.66 --> 7794.94]  Cause Luke and I need to go home at some point here.
[7795.84 --> 7796.50]  Do do do do.
[7798.22 --> 7802.18]  Nathan asks,
[7802.26 --> 7804.30]  will there be an option to buy replacement bits for the screwdriver?
[7804.50 --> 7804.92]  Yes.
[7805.38 --> 7805.62]  Um,
[7805.62 --> 7809.58]  not only will we have replacements of the bit load that we provide by default,
[7809.58 --> 7814.46]  but we are going to have clips that you can buy of like torques in every size,
[7814.90 --> 7815.88]  hex in every size.
[7815.88 --> 7817.88]  So you can actually build out your own bit load.
[7817.88 --> 7823.66]  And we are targeting very reasonable pricing with the additional Linus tech tips.
[7824.32 --> 7824.72]  Uh,
[7825.68 --> 7826.28]  very nice.
[7826.44 --> 7826.84]  Um,
[7827.32 --> 7828.28]  we probably won't call them that,
[7828.32 --> 7828.42]  but,
[7828.78 --> 7828.94]  uh,
[7828.94 --> 7829.92]  we are targeting a,
[7829.92 --> 7830.32]  a,
[7830.32 --> 7831.90]  a really fair price point.
[7831.90 --> 7833.06]  It's not super aggressive,
[7833.06 --> 7834.14]  but it's very fair.
[7834.14 --> 7836.76]  So it should be no problem for people to kind of go,
[7836.84 --> 7836.92]  okay,
[7836.96 --> 7837.10]  yeah,
[7837.10 --> 7840.76]  I'll pick up the screwdriver and then just kind of grab anything that I would want.
[7840.76 --> 7843.80]  And then I can build my own perfect optimal bit load.
[7845.36 --> 7845.80]  Um,
[7846.26 --> 7846.64]  Hey,
[7846.84 --> 7848.34]  shout out to float plane from Johan.
[7850.02 --> 7850.26]  Message.
[7850.26 --> 7853.58]  Why do you use Plex and not jellyfin or MB?
[7853.70 --> 7857.70]  I've actually truthfully never tried jellyfish or MB and I have a lifetime Plex membership.
[7857.70 --> 7859.86]  So there's no real reason for me to try something else.
[7859.90 --> 7860.90]  I've been pretty happy with it.
[7863.00 --> 7863.62]  Carl says,
[7863.70 --> 7864.30]  I agree with David.
[7864.42 --> 7866.58]  Bigger orders are cheaper for shipping to Europe.
[7866.58 --> 7867.90]  And he got every single banana,
[7868.04 --> 7868.74]  a water bottle,
[7869.30 --> 7869.84]  a t-shirt,
[7869.94 --> 7870.16]  t-shirt,
[7870.26 --> 7870.50]  t-shirt,
[7870.62 --> 7870.88]  t-shirt,
[7871.04 --> 7871.42]  lanyard,
[7871.72 --> 7872.10]  desk pad.
[7874.16 --> 7874.56]  Nice.
[7875.56 --> 7875.72]  Uh,
[7875.72 --> 7879.66]  Tanner says it hurt when you talked down on the duo to a few land shows ago,
[7879.66 --> 7881.62]  saying your viewers are smart enough not to get it.
[7881.76 --> 7883.32]  I've been pretty hyped about it for a while.
[7883.40 --> 7883.80]  Personally.
[7884.36 --> 7884.60]  Anyway,
[7884.64 --> 7886.18]  my fold three just came in a couple of days ago.
[7886.22 --> 7886.54]  It's awesome.
[7886.58 --> 7887.06]  And I'm loving it.
[7887.48 --> 7887.76]  I,
[7887.86 --> 7889.30]  I do think you made the right choice.
[7889.36 --> 7890.22]  I think the,
[7890.30 --> 7893.10]  the folding screen is going to be a better experience than the,
[7893.10 --> 7894.76]  the hinge like dual display,
[7894.90 --> 7895.38]  uh,
[7895.58 --> 7896.32]  portable device.
[7898.54 --> 7898.90]  Okay.
[7900.02 --> 7900.42]  Oh,
[7900.72 --> 7901.16]  interesting.
[7901.16 --> 7904.80]  Nicholas has a PSA about the Best Buy membership.
[7905.68 --> 7909.38]  So it's being advertised at $13 a month with the same geek squad
[7909.38 --> 7909.78]  services.
[7909.78 --> 7911.38]  Plus setting up and removing bloatware.
[7912.04 --> 7912.90]  Having shopped there before,
[7913.02 --> 7915.90]  I was curious if their protections turns out for four years protection
[7915.90 --> 7917.06]  through the full price,
[7917.10 --> 7918.48]  you pay 450 CAD,
[7918.82 --> 7920.76]  but if you didn't know any better and sign up for the geek squad
[7920.76 --> 7921.10]  membership,
[7921.10 --> 7924.86]  you're paying over $600 for the same floor years and basically the same
[7924.86 --> 7925.30]  service.
[7925.50 --> 7926.78]  So you should get the,
[7926.78 --> 7927.06]  uh,
[7927.08 --> 7928.68]  like Best Buy membership instead.
[7929.36 --> 7930.10]  Thanks Nicholas.
[7930.26 --> 7930.96]  And thanks for the order.
[7932.10 --> 7932.58]  Okay.
[7934.32 --> 7936.44]  Zeb says after experiencing Linux for a while,
[7936.50 --> 7939.24]  how confident are you feeling about Linux shipping with the steam deck?
[7939.38 --> 7943.36]  Um,
[7943.58 --> 7948.32]  if their goal is to have 100% of the games in the steam library working,
[7948.32 --> 7949.80]  uh,
[7949.96 --> 7951.24]  how long are they,
[7951.32 --> 7953.76]  they're planning on shipping it like next month soon,
[7953.76 --> 7956.96]  unless there's a big update they're failing.
[7958.66 --> 7959.26]  So,
[7959.26 --> 7960.12]  okay.
[7960.12 --> 7963.54]  I'm going to actually share a rosier perspective.
[7963.80 --> 7968.46]  I'm feeling pretty good about it because my biggest problem has never been
[7968.46 --> 7969.44]  that it's impossible.
[7969.88 --> 7974.16]  My biggest problem has been that there's workarounds and,
[7974.16 --> 7975.20]  uh,
[7975.30 --> 7975.48]  you know,
[7975.48 --> 7978.00]  launch flags and dependencies,
[7978.68 --> 7978.84]  blah,
[7978.88 --> 7979.00]  blah,
[7979.06 --> 7979.18]  blah,
[7979.18 --> 7979.36]  blah,
[7979.36 --> 7979.62]  blah,
[7979.68 --> 7979.80]  blah,
[7979.86 --> 7979.96]  blah,
[7980.02 --> 7980.18]  blah.
[7980.18 --> 7982.08]  So as long as valve's doing all the work.
[7983.00 --> 7983.36]  Okay.
[7983.94 --> 7985.52]  My thing is if they do the work though,
[7985.70 --> 7986.18]  that's the,
[7986.44 --> 7987.82]  and it seems like they're kind of,
[7987.86 --> 7988.16]  you know,
[7988.16 --> 7989.10]  probably going to,
[7989.18 --> 7990.42]  they've said they will.
[7991.08 --> 7991.48]  Um,
[7991.48 --> 7992.46]  it's not there yet,
[7992.46 --> 7993.44]  at least publicly.
[7993.70 --> 7996.02]  Maybe there's like some big proton update coming.
[7996.18 --> 7996.80]  I don't know.
[7997.44 --> 7997.80]  Um,
[7997.80 --> 7998.62]  but there's,
[7998.72 --> 7999.58]  there's still issues.
[7999.58 --> 8002.10]  And a lot of those issues come in with DRM stuff,
[8002.10 --> 8002.36]  right?
[8002.36 --> 8005.18]  Like almost every game that I've found that isn't going to work or doesn't
[8005.18 --> 8005.44]  work.
[8005.66 --> 8006.76]  There's a DRM issue,
[8006.76 --> 8007.20]  but like,
[8007.20 --> 8008.46]  I don't know if they can solve that.
[8008.66 --> 8009.16]  Maybe they can,
[8009.20 --> 8009.80]  maybe they can't.
[8010.08 --> 8010.36]  Uh,
[8010.36 --> 8013.18]  but there was a claim that they'd get the whole library working.
[8013.18 --> 8014.58]  And that looks a little sketchy right now.
[8014.70 --> 8016.44]  I I'm still really stoked for my purchase.
[8016.52 --> 8017.20]  I think it's going to be great.
[8017.60 --> 8017.96]  Uh,
[8018.02 --> 8018.36]  Jake,
[8018.48 --> 8019.00]  you're right.
[8019.50 --> 8023.42]  The command line is definitely worth learning at least a little bit about
[8023.42 --> 8024.22]  a hundred percent.
[8026.38 --> 8026.74]  Okay.
[8026.94 --> 8027.74]  Depends who you are.
[8028.12 --> 8028.52]  Um,
[8029.04 --> 8030.32]  I think knowing a cup,
[8030.42 --> 8033.50]  knowing not being scared of it is a good thing.
[8033.92 --> 8034.06]  Yeah.
[8034.10 --> 8034.72]  But like if you,
[8034.82 --> 8039.02]  if you use your computer to play legal legends and counter strike two days a
[8039.02 --> 8039.86]  week for fun.
[8039.92 --> 8040.20]  Okay.
[8040.26 --> 8041.62]  Then you need to learn the command line.
[8041.68 --> 8041.88]  No.
[8043.10 --> 8043.46]  Uh,
[8043.46 --> 8044.06]  Carl says,
[8044.12 --> 8044.78]  I agree with David.
[8044.96 --> 8046.86]  Bigger orders are cheaper on shipping to Europe.
[8047.48 --> 8048.44]  All the bananas,
[8048.76 --> 8049.32]  water bottle,
[8049.64 --> 8050.32]  bunch of shirts,
[8050.68 --> 8051.10]  lanyard,
[8051.44 --> 8051.98]  desk pad.
[8052.18 --> 8052.50]  All right.
[8052.54 --> 8053.02]  Fair enough.
[8053.98 --> 8054.38]  Um,
[8054.72 --> 8055.36]  anonymous says,
[8055.46 --> 8057.62]  I cannot believe you didn't call them.
[8057.62 --> 8060.50]  When the yards were working on that.
[8060.90 --> 8061.30]  Oh,
[8061.64 --> 8062.30]  till black and orange.
[8062.50 --> 8062.78]  Cool.
[8063.02 --> 8063.16]  Yeah.
[8063.22 --> 8064.58]  So far they've been only single color.
[8065.46 --> 8065.86]  Yeah.
[8065.86 --> 8066.82]  Um,
[8066.90 --> 8070.14]  anonymous says the ability to wear your merch and have the brand be known by those who
[8070.14 --> 8073.86]  know while not looking like a giant advertising billboard is always appreciated.
[8073.86 --> 8076.52]  That's actually been a big shift for us.
[8076.58 --> 8077.88]  A lot of our earlier merch was like,
[8077.96 --> 8079.88]  line is tech tips all over it.
[8079.88 --> 8081.18]  And over time,
[8081.18 --> 8081.88]  um,
[8081.88 --> 8082.98]  starting with the stealth hoodie,
[8083.04 --> 8084.42]  that was actually where the name came from.
[8084.50 --> 8085.28]  Stealth branding.
[8085.66 --> 8090.84]  We've wanted to make it more just like clothes that are affordable and quality and that anyone
[8090.84 --> 8092.08]  wouldn't want to actually wear.
[8092.26 --> 8094.72]  And we knew that because we've been going to cons forever.
[8094.72 --> 8098.90]  And the best merch that you could ever get from anybody was the stuff that was,
[8099.06 --> 8099.18]  yeah,
[8099.22 --> 8100.60]  maybe some people would recognize it,
[8100.62 --> 8102.12]  but it wasn't like totally in your face.
[8102.34 --> 8103.00]  A hundred percent.
[8104.04 --> 8104.44]  Okay.
[8104.50 --> 8104.76]  Sorry,
[8104.82 --> 8104.98]  guys.
[8104.98 --> 8106.48]  I can't do any more of these.
[8106.72 --> 8107.08]  Um,
[8107.28 --> 8109.84]  you guys are absolutely amazing.
[8110.38 --> 8115.42]  We got 183 merch messages on the show today.
[8116.64 --> 8117.08]  Wow.
[8117.60 --> 8117.90]  Um,
[8117.90 --> 8118.48]  thanks Anthony.
[8118.62 --> 8119.32]  Thanks Josh.
[8119.40 --> 8119.54]  Okay.
[8119.54 --> 8121.24]  Had a couple more rolling just now.
[8121.42 --> 8123.50]  I think that's it for the show today.
[8123.66 --> 8123.88]  Oh,
[8123.94 --> 8127.18]  actually there were a couple of super chats that I really cannot ignore.
[8127.54 --> 8128.02]  Uh,
[8128.02 --> 8130.58]  someone sent a $100 super chat.
[8130.58 --> 8132.92]  So I should probably have a look at that.
[8132.92 --> 8135.74]  Those people should probably start doing merch messages.
[8135.88 --> 8136.40]  Cause we have,
[8136.52 --> 8138.10]  we have said we're not going to do super chats.
[8138.10 --> 8138.12]  Yes,
[8138.12 --> 8138.58]  please.
[8138.76 --> 8139.78]  I didn't say it today.
[8140.78 --> 8141.18]  Um,
[8141.48 --> 8142.38]  Daryl says,
[8142.50 --> 8144.18]  LTT backpack in the shape of a penguin.
[8144.42 --> 8146.44]  One appendage could be an LTT water bottle.
[8146.60 --> 8147.86]  One could be an I fix it kit.
[8147.98 --> 8150.84]  One compressed air and the other for a USB hard drive.
[8150.92 --> 8152.34]  The body could fit your laptop.
[8155.20 --> 8156.10]  You know what I,
[8156.24 --> 8156.82]  you know what I,
[8157.06 --> 8157.30]  that,
[8157.36 --> 8158.14]  uh,
[8158.14 --> 8158.58]  image,
[8158.70 --> 8160.18]  you know what image that conjures for me?
[8160.18 --> 8165.32]  Those like animal shaped backpacks that like eight year old girls wear.
[8165.66 --> 8167.10]  I kind of love it,
[8167.16 --> 8168.70]  but I don't think we're going to develop that.
[8169.86 --> 8170.26]  Um,
[8170.68 --> 8171.44]  M Hoffman says,
[8171.48 --> 8173.38]  what do you really think about the Odyssey Neo G9?
[8173.54 --> 8176.84]  We actually meant to do a followup non-sponsored review of it.
[8176.98 --> 8177.38]  Um,
[8177.62 --> 8178.86]  and I haven't gotten to that.
[8178.92 --> 8179.86]  I really should do that.
[8180.12 --> 8181.70]  So I tried to find an unsponsored review,
[8181.80 --> 8182.34]  but couldn't,
[8182.42 --> 8185.16]  I still haven't tried a production unit,
[8185.26 --> 8185.54]  right?
[8185.54 --> 8188.62]  I remember the delay was that the production ones weren't out yet when I put it on,
[8188.70 --> 8189.16]  uh,
[8189.20 --> 8189.62]  on Trello.
[8191.62 --> 8192.02]  Um,
[8192.10 --> 8192.96]  Daryl Lyle says,
[8193.08 --> 8193.42]  uh,
[8193.44 --> 8197.10]  the biggest issue with the Linux challenge is the fact that you think no one should use
[8197.10 --> 8197.66]  the command line.
[8197.76 --> 8197.86]  Well,
[8197.88 --> 8198.16]  in Windows,
[8198.22 --> 8200.50]  I have to install various programs to understand why it crashes.
[8200.64 --> 8202.68]  I don't see that as being any different except with Linux,
[8202.76 --> 8203.66]  the commands are there.
[8204.54 --> 8204.90]  Um,
[8205.42 --> 8205.70]  well,
[8205.76 --> 8207.68]  I'm not saying no one should use the command line.
[8207.72 --> 8208.86]  I'm saying no one should have to,
[8208.86 --> 8211.04]  to do what they want to do on their computer.
[8211.22 --> 8212.08]  That's the difference.
[8212.08 --> 8213.48]  And by no one,
[8213.90 --> 8214.44]  I mean,
[8214.82 --> 8215.36]  average gamer,
[8215.48 --> 8215.64]  right?
[8215.68 --> 8218.98]  Because this is supposed to be as gamers that were,
[8219.20 --> 8220.28]  that were going through this challenge,
[8220.38 --> 8221.84]  not as,
[8221.94 --> 8222.30]  you know,
[8222.78 --> 8225.68]  by day developers who happen to play some games.
[8225.72 --> 8227.56]  We're talking people who identify as a gamer,
[8227.68 --> 8227.88]  right?
[8228.70 --> 8229.02]  Um,
[8229.06 --> 8229.42]  Daryl says,
[8229.48 --> 8230.14]  regardless of us,
[8230.18 --> 8230.98]  Linux users complaining,
[8231.08 --> 8232.08]  thank you for doing the challenge.
[8232.20 --> 8233.04]  This will help Linux.
[8233.08 --> 8234.16]  Even if your feedback's all negative.
[8234.26 --> 8234.44]  Hey,
[8234.52 --> 8234.96]  thanks.
[8235.10 --> 8235.28]  We're,
[8235.28 --> 8235.76]  we're trying.
[8235.92 --> 8237.48]  We really are like we're,
[8237.48 --> 8237.68]  we're,
[8237.80 --> 8242.06]  we came into it wanting to support mainstream adoption.
[8242.08 --> 8242.48]  of Linux.
[8242.54 --> 8243.62]  That's where our heart is at.
[8243.78 --> 8247.20]  And we've run into some challenges that have led us to believe that no,
[8247.24 --> 8250.30]  it is in fact not ready for prime time for gamers just yet,
[8250.30 --> 8252.48]  but that's part of the process,
[8252.54 --> 8252.70]  right?
[8252.72 --> 8255.08]  You have to find all the things that are bad in order to,
[8255.70 --> 8256.08]  um,
[8257.44 --> 8260.24]  consolidate down to just things that are good.
[8261.54 --> 8262.84]  And is that where we call it?
[8263.34 --> 8263.58]  Uh,
[8263.64 --> 8263.98]  it can be.
[8264.14 --> 8264.46]  All right.
[8264.46 --> 8265.94]  Thanks for tuning in guys.
[8266.06 --> 8266.98]  We'll see you again next week.
[8267.08 --> 8268.06]  Same bad time,
[8268.18 --> 8269.86]  same bad channel.
[8270.72 --> 8271.12]  Bye.
[8272.08 --> 8273.08]  Bye.
[8279.30 --> 8280.16]  Sounds good.
[8280.16 --> 8280.64]  Conrad.
[8280.64 --> 8281.78]  That makes sense.
[8281.94 --> 8283.04]  Keep it as is.
[8283.34 --> 8284.04]  I agree.
[8293.54 --> 8294.50]  Brought to you guys,
[8294.58 --> 8294.96]  Spanning,
[8295.36 --> 8296.14]  MSI,
[8296.58 --> 8297.56]  and Ritualer.
[8297.74 --> 8298.10]  Yay.
[8298.10 --> 8298.36]  Yay.
[8298.36 --> 8298.40]  Yay.
[8298.40 --> 8298.42]  Yay.
[8298.42 --> 8298.44]  Yay.
