[0.00 → 3.30] Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen. We've got a fantastic show for you guys today.
[3.40 → 9.42] Lots of good, good topics. I'll find them. They're here somewhere. Ah, there's a good one.
[11.48 → 20.66] Now, China is limiting minors to one hour of video games per day and only on Fridays,
[21.04 → 28.08] Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays from 8 to 9 p.m. Now, we're going to have to figure out
[28.08 → 36.20] if there's a little more to this. But wow, that is aggro. In other aggro news,
[37.60 → 44.78] Reddit has banned COVID denial Subreddit, citing rule one as justification. What is rule one?
[45.12 → 52.02] We'll be talking about that as well. Quantum computing just got weirder. New AMD quantum
[52.02 → 59.74] computing patent. Quotes, literally, teleportation. We'll talk about that in a little bit here.
[59.92 → 64.26] Also, a day off on Twitch. Every single streamer. That's not today, is it?
[64.88 → 70.14] I actually don't know. We're not in violation of day off Twitch, are we?
[70.78 → 73.50] Took place on September 1st. We're good. We're good. It's okay.
[73.50 → 81.52] Okay. So now Twitch is okay because that day is over. Yeah. Sure. Yep. Rolling the intro.
[81.52 → 107.12] Show is brought to you today, ladies and gentlemen, by the one and only Squarespace,
[107.12 → 115.24] Ridge Wallet, and Back blaze. Obviously, we're going to have to jump right into our headline topic for
[115.24 → 123.34] the day, the gaming ban for minors in China. Now, obviously, it's a little bit more complicated,
[123.34 → 132.36] but it's also not entirely unexpected. This new law supersedes 2019 rules that allowed 90 minutes per
[132.36 → 138.44] day and forbade playing between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., with the justification back then being that,
[138.56 → 145.76] well, kids shouldn't be playing too many video games, and they shouldn't be up late such that it
[145.76 → 152.94] will affect their schooling, which is, I mean, fair enough. But whether that is the role of the state
[152.94 → 159.16] or the role of the parent is something that I think a lot of people would disagree about.
[159.16 → 165.96] The 2019 measures also limited minors' monthly spending on games to a maximum of $57, which appears
[165.96 → 173.76] to be unchanged. This new policy also enforces a policy requiring game companies to require players'
[173.88 → 184.50] real names when logging in. I mean, imagine giving up your minor data protection laws in order to
[184.50 → 191.30] make sure that those minors who companies are now, by law, collecting information from are not
[191.30 → 196.66] playing too many video games. That's an interesting double-edged sword right there. The press release
[196.66 → 204.26] on state media said it is indisputable that indulging in online games affects normal study life and teens'
[204.26 → 211.30] physical and mental health. I could see that. Young Chinese gamers are lashing out at the new rules.
[211.30 → 218.82] One objection. Sexual consent at 14. At 16, you can go out to work, but you have to be 18 to play games.
[219.38 → 224.90] This is really a joke. Pretty good observation as well. I don't think I could have put it any better
[224.90 → 231.30] myself. Now, to be clear, there's nothing that the Chinese government can do to prevent a minor from
[231.30 → 237.78] playing a single-player game completely disconnected from the internet. If there was, I'm sure they would be
[237.78 → 242.42] trying to figure out how to do that. In fact, my understanding is that functionality like that
[242.42 → 248.82] could end up being baked into game platforms like the Chinese version of Steam, so that if you are
[248.82 → 255.70] playing a single-player offline game, it could theoretically be enforced. But my understanding
[255.70 → 262.50] is there's no actual enforcement or attempt to enforce any kind of rule like that. This is mostly focused
[262.50 → 272.74] on online gaming. So let's talk, Luke. How would this have affected your childhood? Why don't we start with that?
[275.54 → 281.14] Pretty majorly, but probably not as much as you would think. We were an extremely sports-heavy household.
[281.14 → 286.10] I played a lot of sports. Many days of the week, I was out at practice or game day.
[286.10 → 294.58] I mostly, I'm remembering now, I rated in WoW. So that was two nights a week and essentially every
[294.58 → 298.66] single other night playing sports. So I wouldn't have been able to do that.
[298.66 → 299.62] But see-
[299.62 → 302.26] Because that would take, that would generally take three hours.
[302.26 → 310.42] But the problem here is that, am I misinterpreting this? Is there only a one-hour window in which you can play video games?
[310.42 → 316.26] Yeah. Everyone is tied within that one-hour window. That's one of the most interesting things to me,
[316.26 → 322.58] personally, about this whole thing. It's the one specific one-hour window between 8 and 9 p.m.,
[323.14 → 328.34] which is like, kind of, sort of neat in a way, because I feel like, like, you know, all your friends
[328.34 → 329.30] are going to be online.
[329.30 → 334.98] Yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent. Because, I mean, the thing about, the thing about having something like
[334.98 → 340.98] a weekly limit is that if you were, you know, you had a sports ball practice on Tuesday night,
[340.98 → 345.70] or you had a family dinner on Wednesday night, and, you know, Thursday night, you had some homework
[345.70 → 350.58] to catch up on Friday night, you could be like, woo! I'm staying up late! I'm going to play video games all night!
[350.58 → 352.50] Woo! I'm going to play some Pokémon Blue!
[354.18 → 360.82] That's not possible. You can't really, you can't really ration if you don't have a ton of flexibility in
[360.82 → 366.82] terms of how you take advantage of that limited amount of time that you're allowed to spend gaming.
[366.82 → 371.14] What I want to know is, actually, this is great! Float plane Chat's already talking about it.
[371.14 → 377.62] Pirate LV says, rip their power grid! All those PCs starting up at once, gotta spin them hard drives!
[377.62 → 380.82] 1.2 billion hard drives spinning up at the same time!
[383.06 → 384.66] It's a lot. It's interesting.
[384.66 → 392.66] Yeah, I mean, and like it mentions, this is only online play, so this really isn't going to restrict
[392.66 → 399.30] everything. There are a lot of single-player games. I do wonder, and they might only do it for China,
[399.30 → 406.42] but I wonder if this might reduce the amount of single-player games that require online handshakes
[406.42 → 413.94] constantly. You know, there's a huge amount of always-online single-player games, and again,
[413.94 → 418.18] maybe this just changes for China, maybe this doesn't change at all, but I wouldn't be surprised
[418.18 → 424.02] if certain companies started kind of going like, oh, wait a second, we might get more sales if we
[424.02 → 428.58] don't make this single-player game always online. But then again, I don't want to generalize, but
[429.30 → 438.74] China has been sort of a hotbed for piracy, so if anything, I think a lot of these always-online
[438.74 → 446.82] requirements are actually specifically targeting the Chinese market. So do you really remove these
[446.82 → 448.82] literally everything gets pirated anyway?
[448.82 → 456.34] And that's fair enough, but I mean, you know, only China could literally pirate a subsidiary of ARM.
[456.34 → 460.98] You know, like that's... Yeah. Okay.
[460.98 → 468.74] That is next level. I mean, that might be the heist of the century at this point. Did you hear about this?
[468.74 → 476.58] I don't even think this is in the doc this week. Is the ARM heist in the doc? Let me have a look here.
[476.58 → 483.22] So this is a totally, totally unrelated news topic, but ARM China has basically gone rogue.
[483.94 → 490.50] I forget the exact order of events, but essentially the executive that wasn't... Because the thing is,
[490.50 → 497.30] in order to operate in China, you have to have some percentage of Chinese ownership. And so that...
[498.58 → 502.50] The executive that I believe has some kind of controlling stake in it pretty much said,
[502.50 → 509.86] I'm... See you later, parent company. We are now going to just start doing our own IP licenses,
[509.86 → 514.90] and we're going to diverge our product development roadmap. And we are now, we are now a different
[514.90 → 525.62] company. Bye-bye. And it's hard to tell if that was precipitated by the rumours of an NVIDIA acquisition,
[525.62 → 530.74] or if this was something that was just kind of a foregone conclusion, and the wheels just started
[530.74 → 540.02] spinning faster when that started coming up. But yeah, it's been... It's kind of crazy to think about,
[540.02 → 545.94] right? Because certainly there have been Chinese firms like Huawei, for example, that have earned a
[545.94 → 552.10] reputation for corporate espionage. You know, by any... I mean, some of the stories really do
[553.06 → 560.50] sound like fiction. You know, planting engineers and, you know, secretly transporting materials out of
[560.50 → 565.70] offices and transmitting them somewhere else, and like all this kind of crazy stuff, right? And,
[566.34 → 571.70] you know, Arm China basically said, well, I don't know, all of that, right? We're just gonna...
[573.22 → 579.14] We have all the IP just by being this company. Why don't we just continue to be this company,
[579.14 → 586.42] but we'll be our own version of this company? Bye. And as far as I can tell, I haven't actually looked
[586.42 → 590.74] into it in the last little while. So don't quote me on this, but as far as I can tell, I don't think
[590.74 → 597.46] the Chinese government plans to really do anything about it. So that raises a lot of questions about
[598.10 → 602.74] how you're going to... Dark Force says, I thought the Arm China saga started way before the NVIDIA Arm
[602.74 → 608.10] attempted merger. Yeah, I think you're right. I just remember it kind of... Either it got kicked into high
[608.10 → 613.62] gear, or maybe it was that all of a sudden it was more newsworthy, because it cast that shadow of
[613.62 → 621.14] uncertainty over the acquisition. I think you're probably right. Catwalk Cluster says,
[621.14 → 626.10] China doesn't create tech, they steal it. That's the thing though. That's not actually true. I mean,
[627.14 → 633.22] especially now, the number of like high level engineering graduates and science graduates coming
[633.22 → 639.94] out of Chinese universities compared to Western ones is mind-boggling. These are enormous
[639.94 → 648.26] educational institutions, and they are finding ways to pump out highly, highly educated scientists in a
[648.26 → 652.74] way that pretty much no one else is right now, as far as I can tell. There's also the whole thing
[652.74 → 658.90] where like it's like North American and European kids. It's like, what are their... What are the things
[658.90 → 663.54] that they most want to be when they grow up? And right now, if I remember correctly, it's genuinely
[663.54 → 668.98] like YouTuber and Twitch streamer for North American European. Sorry. I have corrupted the youth.
[668.98 → 674.74] Yeah, it's completely your fault. No one else's. You have all the blame solely. I'm sorry. I'm just so
[674.74 → 680.98] cool. I can't help if people want to be like me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That weren't it. And then in
[680.98 → 687.54] China, it's scientists and astronaut, I think. Right. Yep. Or something. Yeah. I don't remember exactly
[687.54 → 691.22] what it is. Scientists is one of them. I don't remember the other one. It might be scientists and engineer. I'm not
[691.22 → 695.94] sure. They're scientists and doctor. I'm pretty sure it's scientists and doctor. So don't kid yourself.
[698.02 → 706.50] China's inventing laws. But there are areas where, whether it's due to intellectual property
[706.50 → 713.14] protection or whether it's due to just the fact that it's been being worked on elsewhere for so much
[713.14 → 720.82] longer, there are areas where China is behind. And central processing is one of them. But obviously,
[720.82 → 729.62] that's that took a giant, a giant leap, a great leap forward, I think is probably the correct term for
[729.62 → 739.38] that with the acquisition of arms, intellectual property. And I have no idea how the documents
[739.38 → 747.30] and processes that arm uses and references and the creation of their technology, I have no idea how
[747.86 → 753.62] that is sequestered from, you know, one regional office to another. I would kind of think in order to
[754.18 → 761.38] to, you know, create a next generation arm, you know, instruction, like ISA instruction set architecture,
[761.38 → 770.18] whatever else I would, I would imagine that, um, it kind of everyone would need access to everything.
[770.18 → 778.82] I don't know. I yeah, maybe I mean, maybe it's more isolated than that. Maybe they have to kind
[778.82 → 785.54] of put the pieces together. I have no idea. I mean, I wouldn't even surprise me to read an article
[785.54 → 790.26] about, you know, a literal SWAT team storming the arm headquarters at this point, like.
[790.26 → 792.26] Yeah.
[793.70 → 799.86] Okay. Uh, right. So back to kids in China, not being allowed to play video games. Yes.
[801.78 → 810.26] There are two major questions here, right? Like one is done video games actually, you know, harm you to such
[810.26 → 815.86] a degree that you should be you should be limited to an hour a day? Like, are these harmful?
[815.86 → 825.22] Um, the the the statement that they made is indulging in online games affects normal study life
[825.22 → 831.70] and teens physical and mental health. Um, your study life and your physical health, like, yeah,
[832.26 → 839.94] unquestionably. I also think the impact of online games on someone's mental health is actually probably
[839.94 → 845.54] a very interesting thing to look into. And I think in a lot of cases, it's probably negative.
[846.02 → 850.66] Um, if you're is you're notably surrounding yourself specifically with friends,
[851.46 → 859.78] um, that's kind of its own thing. And that's interesting. Um, but I think a lot of times you
[859.78 → 864.42] just end up in COD lobbies where everyone's just screaming into the mic as many profanities and
[864.42 → 869.22] offensive things as they possibly can. And I don't know how helpful that necessarily is. So that specific
[869.22 → 875.70] statement, like they're probably on base with it. Um, that being said, I don't, I don't know.
[876.34 → 880.42] It gets interesting because it's an it's a different country, and it's its pretty much as different as
[880.42 → 885.38] you could possibly imagine. I mean, so like, is it possible that we just are completely out of touch
[885.38 → 893.22] westerners and have no idea that actually this gaming addiction among Chinese youth is, is a epidemic
[893.22 → 898.42] that is destroying an entire generation of people? Like, I don't know.
[898.42 → 901.62] It's different. It's different, right? It's its very different over there. I have no idea.
[902.42 → 906.90] I can't, I can't claim to say things with fact about a place that I know very little about.
[906.90 → 912.74] This is a this is a great comment from Thelonious Mac that says that this is not just about gaming.
[912.74 → 918.90] China's concerned about games being used as a means for subversive communications. It's hard to
[918.90 → 926.18] monitor the, you know, messages between every, every dwarf in a WoW server, for example. Um, but the thing
[926.18 → 931.86] about that is that, okay, actually that's kind of a that's kind of a good point. I was going to say,
[931.86 → 939.62] you know, having an hour when everyone's online is basically, uh, if anything increasing the amount of,
[939.62 → 944.90] of potential noise that you might have to sift through in order to find these.
[944.90 → 946.66] It's not to be sifted through live.
[946.66 → 953.94] Communications, right? Um, because like literally everyone is going to be online at exactly the same
[953.94 → 958.98] time. The odds of coming across something useful seems to me might be, might be lower. But then again,
[959.70 → 968.02] if you are limiting their ability to communicate to just, you know, one hour a day, um, maybe that's
[968.02 → 974.58] just sort of deemed useful. But then the thing is, I mean, these are kids, right? These are probably
[974.58 → 979.46] not revolutionaries that are, you know, gonna, going to storm the Capitol. Um,
[981.86 → 986.10] is, is this really who we're concerned about? Like, help me out here.
[986.10 → 992.90] Well, I don't know. It's very different there, right? Like, I don't know. Um,
[994.18 → 1002.18] so it's, I, I can't, I can't, I don't think I can pose any real understanding of this because I
[1002.18 → 1007.54] don't understand. I don't, I, I lack so much knowledge on, on Chinese culture and their
[1007.54 → 1011.46] situations. Like something that was brought up last time we talked about one of these topics,
[1011.46 → 1018.50] um, was it, it, it was mentioned that like, oh, the government shouldn't be like, uh, taking care
[1018.50 → 1022.66] of the kids. The parents should be taking care of the kids. And someone brought up, well, okay,
[1023.46 → 1027.70] it's very common for work hours to be longer there. Yeah. The parents might not be home.
[1027.70 → 1032.10] So like the, the government is trying to step in to help with that because a lot of, a lot of them
[1032.10 → 1038.90] are not home and can't afford a nanny. Um, so like it's, it's kids just alone at home by themselves.
[1038.90 → 1044.02] So they're trying to exert some amount of control there. That's an unfortunate thing that's becoming
[1044.02 → 1048.82] a little bit more common here, but is not really a standard in, in North America, I would say. So
[1048.82 → 1054.42] it's something that is foreign, um, to me. And that's, that's not something I would have necessarily
[1054.42 → 1058.50] expected, but if the kids are just running around at home alone, trying to force them to do something
[1058.50 → 1063.38] else other than just play games might make sense. I don't know. Uh, it's a situation I've never had
[1063.38 → 1068.50] to deal with, but I don't know. It's, it's very, very different. I mean, one hour all at the same
[1068.50 → 1074.98] time seems a little odd, but Tim SP says, I think every generation has their vices that they, you know,
[1074.98 → 1080.34] attempt to protect children from, uh, when I went to university, my dad kept warning me about card
[1080.34 → 1085.38] players who flunked out when he went to school. They spent all their time like playing cards instead
[1085.38 → 1090.02] of studying. Um, if you want to do stuff that isn't studying and there will always be something
[1090.02 → 1094.26] you can, what is that? You can push the circle down the road with a stick, but you can push the ring
[1094.26 → 1098.66] down the road with a stick, whatever that old game was like, yeah, yeah. People will find a way to
[1098.66 → 1103.54] distract themselves. Play some, play some kick the can, some, some rings, some, uh, ball in a cup.
[1103.54 → 1112.82] Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I, uh, I, I, I, I hate it. I, you know, I think it's out of touch. Um, I think that
[1112.82 → 1120.10] treating, treating video games, like there's some kind of, of the devil that should be basically,
[1120.10 → 1127.54] I mean, it's in a way this is more regulated than, you know, even legitimately dangerous substances are,
[1127.54 → 1136.10] um, in many parts of the world. Like I, it's, it's kind of, it's just baffling to me, but I also never
[1136.10 → 1142.02] really had, uh, the very, very toxic gaming experiences that some people seem to experience,
[1142.02 → 1149.78] right? Like I, I was never so addicted to gaming that it prevented me from functioning in my day-to-day
[1149.78 → 1154.74] life. And I know that that is a thing that some people do experience, but here's what I want to know
[1154.74 → 1160.58] is, I mean, China is, whether you like it or not, whether you want to admit it or not,
[1160.58 → 1166.82] is an authoritarian regime, right? So what, who's to say that this isn't just an experiment? Well,
[1166.82 → 1172.74] let's start with the kids because we can kind of, oh, but think of the children, it, uh, in order to
[1172.74 → 1179.94] justify it. And if it's a success, then we roll this out throughout because from a, from a government
[1179.94 → 1185.94] standpoint, why wouldn't I just prefer if everyone was being productive? You know what I mean? Like
[1185.94 → 1191.78] video games, they, they, I, you know, I don't know if you could, I don't know if you can prove that it is
[1191.78 → 1197.70] indisputable that indulging in online games affects normal study life and physical and mental health,
[1197.70 → 1204.02] but you can certainly indisputably prove that it's not productive. It doesn't produce anything.
[1204.02 → 1211.14] Well, there's, I don't know. There's some like, ah, especially in, in the times of COVID,
[1211.14 → 1215.62] I would say it's a it's a good way to get social energy out. Like if you and all your friends jump
[1215.62 → 1221.46] online, like that's a that's a social activity. Um, but it's also different types of, what does it
[1221.46 → 1230.74] produce? Happiness? No, that's not a product. Uh, you can still produce happiness. It's a it's a drug in your brain.
[1230.74 → 1238.10] Uh, okay. I mean, I guess, okay. We want to talk now you're producing dopamine hits. I mean,
[1238.10 → 1242.58] by that logic, why don't we all just do hard drugs then? No, I think it would be productive then by
[1242.58 → 1247.06] your definition. Okay. So dopamine would come from the game itself, but I believe the social pleasure
[1247.06 → 1252.82] would be something else, not dopamine. Um, I can't claim enough to know to name it off top of my head,
[1252.82 → 1258.98] but, um, serotonin, is that right? I don't know. Anyway, I, I think there's, there are benefits that you
[1258.98 → 1264.74] could argue that could come from it, but I don't know. Uh, I think it's very easy to argue the
[1264.74 → 1269.62] otherwise. John Wick in the float plane chat says, yeah, let's just destroy this multi-billion dollar
[1269.62 → 1278.18] gaming market. Um, honestly, right now it seems like the CPC gives exactly zero about the economic
[1278.18 → 1282.26] damage to their policies. I mean, you see the way they're cracking down on big tech over there.
[1282.74 → 1288.66] Uh, honestly, some of the things they're doing are moves that I completely agree with, not all of it,
[1288.66 → 1297.46] obviously, but specifically going after billionaires in China in, in a, negatively. Like they,
[1297.46 → 1301.86] they are trying to crack down on billionaires in China. It's, it's very different to hear.
[1301.86 → 1306.58] That's another one of those things where like, I'm just, it's very different over there. So it's, uh,
[1307.30 → 1316.90] it's difficult. Why don't we jump into our next topic here? Um, Reddit has banned, uh, COVID denial
[1316.90 → 1325.70] Subreddits citing rule one as justification. So why don't we start with this rule one? What is rule
[1325.70 → 1332.98] one? Um, remember the human Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking
[1332.98 → 1337.22] marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of
[1337.22 → 1342.90] harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that
[1342.90 → 1348.10] promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. That is rule one.
[1351.14 → 1360.02] Okay. So lets how that applies, go back a little bit here. Um, Reddit banned r slash no new normal
[1360.02 → 1368.90] specifically, and then quarantined 54 other Subreddits for breaking rules and spreading COVID, COVID misinformation.
[1368.90 → 1373.94] Uh, so this comes after many other Subreddits protested the amount of misinformation being
[1373.94 → 1382.42] spread on the platform with a post on r slash vax happened reaching 190,000 upvotes. So let's go have
[1382.42 → 1390.34] a quick look at that. Reddit is taking a hot minute to load here. So that's, um, really unusual.
[1390.34 → 1398.58] Uh, hello, Reddit. I tried as well, but it's taking a long time for me too.
[1398.58 → 1404.26] And taking a really long time. No action was taken right away. Uh, the ban slash quarantines came a few
[1404.26 → 1410.10] days later with no response from Reddit administrators in the interim. I am still waiting for that page to
[1410.10 → 1418.34] load. So Reddit admins made a post roughly a year ago, outlining their mission statement regarding COVID-19
[1418.34 → 1422.66] misinformation. So they added a misinformation report flow and called on mods and the community
[1422.66 → 1433.86] to report as much as they could. But here's the thing. Um, Reddit has kind of been a safe haven for
[1433.86 → 1441.30] unpopular opinions, unpopular sentiments for illegal things as much, as much as they don't want to admit
[1441.30 → 1447.06] it. There is a huge amount of, uh, uh, illegal activity that goes through Reddit, just straight up.
[1447.06 → 1455.54] So how do they reconcile that legacy with this kind of move? I'm not going to say that.
[1455.54 → 1463.78] Especially when, especially when rule one is like really ambiguous to be clear, but also doesn't really seem as,
[1463.78 → 1470.42] as totally okay with this as I am rule one doesn't really seem to apply a huge amount here.
[1470.42 → 1480.42] I mean, so apparently one of the big reasons for it was that, um, r slash no new normal was brigadier,
[1481.14 → 1488.82] uh, other Subreddits. So they were, they were kind of, uh, spamming and creating a toxic environment
[1488.82 → 1494.42] in other Subreddits. And that is something that is not permitted.
[1494.42 → 1496.10] Uh, that would go under harassment.
[1496.10 → 1502.18] Probably that would go. Yeah. So that could very easily be harassment, bullying. Um, it would,
[1502.18 → 1507.38] it would surprise me if none of that brigadier contained threats of violence. I mean, that is
[1507.38 → 1514.02] something that people will frequently, uh, just kind of casually throw around on the internet when they
[1514.02 → 1518.82] wouldn't in normal conversation. I mean, like how many times have you heard? Um,
[1518.82 → 1523.46] I mean, how many times have you heard this one? Uh,
[1525.62 → 1530.18] you know what, what the did you just say about me? You little I'll have, you know,
[1530.18 → 1534.58] I graduated top of my class in the Navy SEALs. I've been involved in numerous secret raids on
[1534.58 → 1539.22] Al-Qaeda and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I'm trained in guerilla warfare.
[1539.22 → 1544.58] And I'm the top sniper in the entire U S armed forces. You are nothing to me, but just another
[1544.58 → 1548.34] target. I will wipe you the out with precision, the likes of which you've never seen before on the
[1548.34 → 1553.62] stuff. Like that's the kind of thing that people just copy and paste for Lulu because it's funny on
[1553.62 → 1558.18] the internet, but you would never actually talk to anyone like that. And that's supposed to be why
[1558.18 → 1563.70] it's funny. But a lot of people sort of didn't catch the joke. Um, the, the Al-Qaeda included in
[1563.70 → 1568.42] there is really starting to date that copy and paste. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We need to update. We need to
[1568.42 → 1574.18] update the copy pasta. Let's find another forever war that, uh, the U S starts, and then we can make
[1574.18 → 1587.30] a new copy pasta. Um, so what does this mean for Reddit? Like, you know, yeah, this is, this is
[1587.30 → 1593.22] misinformation. It shouldn't be spread, but I, it's not hate speech. So it's not, uh, it's not
[1593.70 → 1598.82] illegal. Like that's one of the that's one of the key lines. There's, there's plenty of illegal
[1599.62 → 1604.10] stuff that actually does happen on Reddit, but they can do whatever they want, right? Like,
[1604.10 → 1606.66] it doesn't matter if it's illegal or not. If they don't want it to be on the platform,
[1606.66 → 1611.62] they can remove it. Um, we've talked about this in the past. This isn't a government website.
[1611.62 → 1617.62] It's a private website. They cited a somewhat weird rule, and should maybe consider if they
[1617.62 → 1622.42] do want to stop the spread of general misinformation in the future, they should maybe consider
[1622.42 → 1627.38] including a rule about that enforcing that it's going to be incredibly difficult, nigh impossible.
[1627.86 → 1631.78] Um, but I don't know, maybe it's just super selective.
[1631.78 → 1637.46] You'll more D in the float plane chat. Just, uh, just sent the greatest chat. I think I have
[1637.46 → 1642.50] ever seen in the history of our entire live-streaming career. Um, you know, talking about
[1642.50 → 1646.82] like how people talk to each other on the internet, he goes, it's amazing how many 12-year-olds have
[1646.82 → 1655.62] my mom truly is. Those 12-year-olds, they really get around with the older ladies. You know what
[1655.62 → 1660.18] I'm saying? It's really impressive. Yeah. Someone should really do something about that. Yeah. We,
[1660.18 → 1668.42] I mean that, that right there is an indisputable threat to these teens, normal study life and physical
[1668.42 → 1677.30] and mental health going around like all these, all these, uh, you know, moms. Yeah. Yeah.
[1678.10 → 1682.34] Those moms, they might've been around themselves. You could, you could, you could catch something.
[1682.34 → 1687.54] You have to be careful. Yeah. So we need to start distributing a lot of condoms to a lot of 12 years
[1687.54 → 1694.90] olds. And that's going to be, that's going to be the way we fight this. I'm sorry. What is this show
[1694.90 → 1703.46] even a phone? No. Oh my goodness. Um, anyway. Yeah. I mean, ultimately it's a it's a private
[1703.46 → 1709.62] platform, right? They can do whatever they want. So I, I don't know. They can cite rule one. It
[1709.62 → 1715.78] doesn't matter if rule one is applicable or not. They could like to cite rule number 69 and
[1716.82 → 1721.30] the, the like text for rule 69 is just nice. And they could be like, that's why we banned it.
[1721.30 → 1724.74] It doesn't matter. It's a private platform. They can do whatever they want. Yep. That's fair.
[1725.78 → 1729.22] I just think that, I don't know. Given enough time. What it means to Reddit, I don't know.
[1729.22 → 1736.90] Yeah. Reddit. I mean, Reddit has Reddit. I have to be honest with you. Furthermore, I never really understood
[1737.46 → 1746.58] why dig needed to be replaced by Reddit. Um, from, from just, uh, uh, from, uh, uh, a very infrequent
[1746.58 → 1752.74] users perspective, I never really used to dig. I never really used Reddit. So I'm sorry if I'm not
[1752.74 → 1759.14] sort of well-versed in the sort of the cultural differences between the two websites from a
[1759.14 → 1766.98] functionality standpoint, obviously Reddit is, is way ahead now, but back then I didn't really get it.
[1766.98 → 1772.18] I didn't really understand why you would post something on Reddit instead of dig or why you would.
[1772.18 → 1777.06] I do know at the time that that kind of shift happened, there were a lot of other alternatives
[1777.06 → 1782.66] as well. But the point I was trying to make is that another Reddit can clearly come along because
[1782.66 → 1789.70] the other Reddit already, um, already existed before. So my, my counterpoint was at that point
[1789.70 → 1794.74] in time, there was a lot of turmoil in the space and right now there is none. And I think Reddit has so
[1794.74 → 1800.50] much market share and so much ubiquity that it would be very difficult to overcome Reddit now.
[1800.50 → 1807.54] And back then when dig was starting and these types of like mass multi news sites were kind of popping
[1807.54 → 1817.46] up, there was what's dig move. Yep. Um, there's two G's there, by the way. Um, uh, it was like,
[1817.46 → 1822.50] it was a huge thing. There were tons of different competing websites, and it was, it was a war to see
[1822.50 → 1828.02] which one was going to win. And a few of them are still sort of around, but Reddit is clearly, um, like,
[1828.02 → 1833.46] like absolute massive amounts beyond all the other ones. And I, I don't think it would be very easy
[1833.46 → 1840.82] for one to take over now just because you'd have to win over so many Subreddits. It would be
[1841.46 → 1847.86] crazy. There are so many communities dialed into Reddit. It has become back in the day,
[1849.46 → 1853.70] a ton of different creators, not just tech creators, a ton of different creators would spin up their own
[1853.70 → 1859.70] forums, right? Now people just do Reddit Subreddits. Yep. Um, it's a lot easier.
[1859.70 → 1867.38] It is. Yeah, for sure. And I think that's something within our space. So I understand it,
[1867.38 → 1871.70] but I'm sure that same type of activity happens elsewhere. Just like people used to make their
[1871.70 → 1878.18] own vent servers. Now they do discord, all that kind of stuff. Things are, are narrowing down into smaller
[1878.18 → 1884.90] amounts of platforms. We should totally get like a mumble server going just for, just for old times
[1884.90 → 1890.58] sake. Yeah, that'd be sweet. I'll get, I'll get it hosted at the, at the, at the office or something
[1890.58 → 1894.90] like that. And we can all, we can all chat on mumble. We'll have to do the WAN show. We'll do our,
[1894.90 → 1899.30] we'll do our call with each other over mumble. Oh, crap. No video. Okay. Well, forget it. Well,
[1899.86 → 1903.78] we'll, well, well, we'll have mumble running in the background, and we'll both just have it muted.
[1903.78 → 1910.34] Okay. Nice. It'll just be sitting there reassuring us. Yeah. I still exist.
[1911.86 → 1919.14] Um, okay. Yeah. I think that's about it on that topic. Yeah. It's all I really have to say. Um,
[1919.14 → 1922.90] that's okay though, because we've got even more controversial things to talk about,
[1922.90 → 1929.78] like this message from our sponsors. Yeah. Freaking got them. Thanks to Back blaze for sponsoring today's
[1929.78 → 1935.30] show. Back blaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $7 a month. That's it.

[1986.82 → 1993.06] most despairing feelings, man. Cause there is just knowing that you're so helpless and there's
[1993.06 → 1999.38] nothing you can do. And it's like, it's not just pictures. It's precious memories. So like you don't
[1999.38 → 2004.90] only ever had it happen once you don't down with the hard drive that died on me.
[2005.78 → 2008.10] Probably. But I don't know if I remember off the top of my head.
[2008.82 → 2012.02] It's working on my mineral computer. My hands are covered in mineral
[2012.02 → 2016.98] gone. It was sad.
[2016.98 → 2024.66] Not as sad as this segue to Ridge Wallet. Thanks to Ridge Wallet for sponsoring today's show.

[2114.58 → 2121.78] float plane has taken? There's not a chance. They mentioned if you have your own domain. We're on the
[2121.78 → 2130.02] sponsor spot, right? We are. Yes. I wonder. Oh, I don't know. Probably not. I would really love to tell
[2130.02 → 2138.90] the story of the domain floatplane.com someday, but we probably just shouldn't. Oh, man. It's a heck
[2138.90 → 2143.70] of a story. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Tell the story. It's a heck of a story. I want to... Yeah. Tell the story.
[2143.70 → 2148.82] Tell the story. There are parts that I don't know if we should go through, though. I think the people
[2148.82 → 2156.98] have a right to know. I think the people have a right to know. Okay. So back in the day, there
[2156.98 → 2164.02] wasn't a domain. Float plane started just on the forum. It was genuinely called Rip Vessel. It wasn't
[2164.02 → 2170.02] called Float plane for a while. It was just a forum section called Rip Vessel. Nick came up with the name
[2170.02 → 2175.78] Float plane. We decided to run with Float plane, but we couldn't get Floatplane.com. Someone owned it,
[2175.78 → 2180.18] and we couldn't figure out who. It was being parked. They wouldn't respond to any of our stuff.
[2181.38 → 2188.42] We tried to seize the domain because it seemed genuinely completely inactive, and the people
[2188.42 → 2193.46] wouldn't respond to our attempts to purchase. And there's some weird clause where you can kind of do
[2193.46 → 2200.02] that. It basically never works. But we were genuinely interested in the possibility that it
[2200.02 → 2208.26] was completely abandoned. So we were kind of probing for that. I feel like I'm forgetting some parts. I
[2208.26 → 2214.58] have some docs with notes on this that I'd have to bring up. But it took... This was a very long process
[2214.58 → 2222.02] of us trying to hunt down this domain. During the process of trying to hunt down this domain, we found
[2222.02 → 2229.78] some names and started trying to follow through with whom these people are and ended up in this.
[2229.78 → 2235.38] Oh, and part of the reason for that was that if it is impossible to get in touch with the owner of a
[2235.38 → 2245.94] domain, you can actually file to have that domain revoked from them. You must be able to contact the
[2245.94 → 2250.26] owner of a domain. They need valid contact information. You can be like, hey, this has
[2250.26 → 2257.22] clearly lapsed and no one's actually holding this, so it should just be available again. That is a thing
[2257.22 → 2262.82] that happens. It's one of the ways that domains can get sniped. It's pretty uncommon. Furthermore, it is possible.
[2262.82 → 2268.66] They can absolutely ignore you. It's just that their contact information does need to be valid.
[2268.66 → 2275.14] Yeah. And there were issues with their contact information. So we were trying to pursue that. But
[2275.14 → 2279.94] we also didn't really actually genuinely didn't really just want to rip it from someone like we
[2280.90 → 2286.42] but their contact information had issues, and we wanted the domain. So we were trying to work on it.
[2287.06 → 2291.94] Ended up finding some names attached to it, but it was like this weird nest of people.
[2292.82 → 2300.90] It seemed like a group of people owned a very large list of domains and had owned them and had
[2300.90 → 2306.66] parked them and done nothing with them ever for a very, very large amount of years. Ended up
[2307.30 → 2313.30] narrowing it down to one person who... Do I go into it? Do it.
[2313.30 → 2323.70] Okay, so they were a Freemason. I found the person who owned it by finding a Freemason website that had
[2324.26 → 2331.38] like ancestry details, and I was able to go through the family lines and find the person who was currently
[2331.38 → 2336.34] alive who owned the domain. They were in a completely different country.
[2336.34 → 2347.70] We tried contacting them. We tried sending mail to two of their home addresses because they have
[2347.70 → 2354.42] houses in different countries. They were ignoring that. We sent mail multiple times. They kept ignoring
[2354.42 → 2360.66] that, kept ignoring that. One time, Linus had to go on a trip to film a video.
[2360.66 → 2367.22] Yeah, in San Francisco. So I don't remember whose idea this was. I feel like it might have been mine,
[2367.22 → 2372.26] but I genuinely don't remember whose idea this was. But we decided, hey, just go knock on the door.
[2373.38 → 2375.70] See what happens. Hey, I want to buy your domain.
[2375.70 → 2388.58] So, um, he knocks on the door and, um, I would say kid. Yeah. Yeah. Young man.
[2388.58 → 2394.42] Young man. Yeah. Not, I wouldn't. Yeah. Kid is not fair. Young man answered the door. I don't think
[2394.42 → 2403.62] he really realized right away, but it turns out he was a fan. So he knew Linus when last knocked on the door.
[2403.62 → 2411.62] Um, then there, there ends up, I don't want to go into too many details here, but the, the father did not live there.
[2411.62 → 2420.18] Yeah. This was an ex spouse situation. Okay. Yeah. So the ex spouse was living in the house with
[2420.18 → 2428.34] the, the, uh, mutual son. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Um, it's the father that owns the domain though. Yes.
[2428.34 → 2432.34] So we didn't really get all the way there. And that's why the mail was ignored. Yeah.
[2432.34 → 2440.26] It was because they didn't really care because it was the dad. Yeah. But through the son's connection,
[2440.26 → 2448.02] we were able to get in contact with the dad. Yes. The dad is not low on the totem pole with the
[2448.02 → 2456.10] Freemasons. Um, uh, didn't really care about us wanting to buy the domain because didn't really care
[2456.10 → 2463.54] about our money, which we didn't have a lot of through, but still didn't really care. Uh, like
[2465.06 → 2469.22] the he kind of shot it down. If I remember correctly, before we even really got to the
[2469.94 → 2475.38] the point of talking about funds anyway, um, what he was potentially interested in
[2476.10 → 2485.22] was, uh, entertaining and potentially career advancing his son. Yes. Um, so we, we, hold on a second.
[2485.86 → 2492.10] A Freemason being about making connections. No, they wouldn't do, they're not into that.
[2492.10 → 2497.54] Never. Okay. I'll let you continue the story anyway, but I really think this is, this is totally
[2497.54 → 2503.38] perfect. It's been a long time. Um, but I think I'm doing, to be clear, I think you've got the story
[2503.38 → 2513.46] bang on. I just, I was just teasing you. So we, we flew, uh, him and his mom. Yes. Up to LTX. Yes.
[2513.46 → 2524.58] Man. Now I'm man. So the agreement was that the price was contingent on us entertaining and, and hosting,
[2524.98 → 2534.02] uh, the son and kind of showing him around and sort of making that connection. And the mom, um,
[2534.02 → 2541.38] uh, reluctantly agreed to accompany the son, uh, because he wasn't allowed to come on his own.
[2541.38 → 2549.14] And, um, I, I would never want to speak ill of anyone, but, um,
[2549.14 → 2558.58] um, the conversation we had when she discovered that we didn't have Uber in Vancouver was one of
[2558.58 → 2564.10] the probably the dumbest conversations I've ever had in my life. Um, you don't have Uber,
[2564.10 → 2567.38] Uber. Well, how are we supposed to get there? And I was just like,
[2567.38 → 2578.50] like, a taxi, a bus walk. I don't know. Um, you're, you're, you're a gross woman. Like I,
[2579.94 → 2586.34] what I'm your, I'm your life coach now. So it, so he, he, he attends LTX. Um,
[2586.82 → 2591.54] we do an office tour. Yeah. Uh, give me one second.
[2593.94 → 2601.14] Uh, that's a sidebar thing. We do an office tour. I think he's kind of enjoying himself.
[2602.90 → 2611.30] Mom? No, not even slightly. Um, the trip is pulled early. They yeet the heck out of there.
[2611.30 → 2621.78] Um, they, they go back home, uh, plan not cool. The, uh, the, the dad was not stoked about this.
[2622.50 → 2628.10] Um, because he didn't really get entirely what he wanted. He wanted more time there and stuff.
[2628.10 → 2634.50] Yep. But understood it wasn't our fault. Yes. Yep. Yep. Was, was quite understanding
[2634.50 → 2640.82] about the whole situation. Um, but still not stoked. No, delayed a little bit,
[2640.82 → 2644.34] but not that long. Like it was totally fine. I think they were just having conversations on the
[2644.34 → 2651.62] back end. And then eventually we settled on a price, which was kind of what we were aiming to pay
[2651.62 → 2657.54] without having done any of that stuff. So, you know, whatever, it still wasn't cheap.
[2658.34 → 2664.90] It was 10 grand. I think it was 10 grand. I think we paid 10 grand. That's actually not bad for a 10
[2664.90 → 2673.78] letter.com. True. Like with actual dictionary words. That's yeah. It's not bad. Um, now in fairness,
[2673.78 → 2680.66] LTX 18, I guess this would have been, I think it was 18. Yeah. It was pretty ghetto. Like it was not,
[2680.66 → 2687.30] um, it was not a lot more so to boost the most reasonable. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it was not the most
[2687.30 → 2691.86] amazing expo we ever did. I could understand, you know, the mom being like, there's nothing for me to do
[2691.86 → 2698.90] here. The mom also could have just like chilled and like shopped or something because the son was
[2698.90 → 2703.78] a young man, not like a small child. And like, Vancouver is a pretty cool place. And like,
[2703.78 → 2708.90] we're just a bunch of tech nerds. What are we going to do? And he, if he was genuinely enjoying
[2708.90 → 2714.10] himself, like I got that vibe. I don't know. Wasn't there a whole thing where, um, because they flew out
[2714.10 → 2720.34] early, they like wanted us to pay like the higher price of the return flight. I remember there was some
[2720.34 → 2724.42] debate around that, and we were kind of sitting here going, well, it's not our fault. You didn't
[2724.42 → 2731.22] take the flight we gave you just because you hated LTX doesn't mean you have to leave Vancouver. Like
[2731.86 → 2736.34] I, that, that I don't necessarily remember too much. I, I'm not saying it didn't happen. I just,
[2736.34 → 2745.06] it's been a long time. Um, so I'm like so confused this, this was genuinely, what do you think? Like
[2745.06 → 2751.78] S my brain is telling me like seven or eight months. Oh, it was, it was a long period of time.
[2751.78 → 2756.98] It was, it was like, I had a Word doc. I had a Word doc that is still somewhere that's, I'm pretty
[2756.98 → 2763.78] sure like five or six pages long, not, not trying to like save this story. So I'll remember it later,
[2763.78 → 2767.86] trying to collect all my notes and stuff so that I could track these things properly and like have
[2767.86 → 2771.54] website links to things and like all this kind of stuff. So I could, I could figure all of this out.
[2771.54 → 2778.34] So this was actually like a really major project trying to acquire this domain. Um,
[2778.34 → 2782.82] and not because it was necessarily expensive. It was because it was genuinely quite difficult to do.
[2783.30 → 2790.42] Um, now that we have it, it's just, yeah, the, the name of the platform is not changing.
[2791.30 → 2798.82] Yeah. Is it a great name? Probably not. Is the name changing? No, definitely not. Yeah, it's not.
[2798.82 → 2807.46] Um, all right. Why don't we jump into another news topic? Oh, actually, LTT store.com. The dad hats are live.
[2808.90 → 2816.02] People have been asking about these because we, uh, I have been accidentally, definitely wearing them
[2816.02 → 2822.26] on camera a lot. Uh, sorry, Nick, I know that you hate it when I do that, but they're just,
[2822.26 → 2830.74] they're so comfortable and cool. Uh, here they are. LTT dad hats. Your dad's fashion's finally cool.
[2830.74 → 2838.50] Haha. Thank you, Sarah. That's got, that's got to be her, her line. Uh, there they are. So we've got
[2838.50 → 2845.46] them in all kinds of different styles and colours. Uh, hold on a second. Let me see if I can figure this
[2845.46 → 2852.26] out. Oh, hold on a second. Oh, yeah. Okay. Here we go. Where's the scroll thing isn't working. It's not
[2852.26 → 2861.70] working. Luke, help me. Why? Okay. Hold on. Classic. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, that's a float plane
[2861.70 → 2869.14] thing for the team there to figure out at any rate. Uh, one of my favourite ones is, uh,
[2869.14 → 2876.26] uh, wow. There are a lot of pictures with that scroll, not working. That's going to be, uh,
[2876.26 → 2880.66] that's going to be a challenge and a half. I wonder if the amount of pictures had something to do with
[2880.66 → 2886.74] it. This is a very, very large amount of pictures. Uh, yes, this is, it might not. Holy. This is one
[2886.74 → 2897.14] of my favourites though. Um, that is really a lot of pictures. Okay. Well, at any rate, we have lots of
[2897.14 → 2902.90] different styles, and we have pictures and oh wait. Okay. So hold on a second. When you have a
[2904.02 → 2910.42] classic. Okay. It works when that variety is available. Luke.
[2912.90 → 2920.90] See this? Oh, not every, not every embroidery has a colour and not every colour has an embroidery.
[2920.90 → 2929.22] Correct. So you have to like to find, okay. So washed black components and RGB are both things.
[2930.02 → 2939.38] Uh, automagically is only in, uh, khaki. It should probably like to have a little like shake,
[2940.02 → 2944.18] like flash red shake thing or something to indicate that there isn't something there.
[2944.18 → 2950.74] Yeah. Or something. Anyway, they're super nice. Go get one. Uh, LTT store.com. All right. What else
[2950.74 → 2960.50] we got for topics today? Do, do, do, do. Oh, Apple news. The walled garden begins to fall or the
[2960.50 → 2967.30] the wall around the garden begins to fall. South Korea's part one, South Korea passes a law
[2967.30 → 2972.98] forcing Apple and Google to allow third party payment processors in the app store and play store.
[2972.98 → 2978.74] So I wonder who could benefit from this. I know, right? In South Korea. I wonder who.
[2980.18 → 2984.74] Yeah. LG. Oh, no, just kidding. They closed down their phone.
[2984.74 → 2987.06] Oh, Samsung. There you go. Yeah.
[2987.94 → 2992.82] South Korea's national assembly has voted to pass an amendment to the country's telecommunications
[2992.82 → 2997.94] business act, forbidding platform holders from forcing developers to use the built-in payment
[2997.94 → 3003.38] system. Such policies would have prevented Apple and Google from removing Fortnite from the iOS app
[3003.38 → 3009.94] store and Google Play Store. Uh, president moon IN is broadly expected to sign the amendment into law
[3009.94 → 3016.34] soon. Tim Sweeney was obviously happy about this, but then went and made it kind of weird. Uh, as
[3016.34 → 3022.34] president Kennedy said at the Berlin Wall in 1963 today, all developers around the world can be proud to
[3022.34 → 3034.66] say I am Korean. Um, okay. Yes. Isn't it? Yeah. He made it weird. Yeah. I'm sure like to be clear,
[3034.66 → 3044.02] like I understand the sentiment, like you should be, you know, proud to something the lawmakers in your
[3044.02 → 3053.62] country sort of understand that this is, uh, like kind of antitrust issue. I don't know that, I don't
[3053.62 → 3060.66] know that this kind of achievement makes me proud to be like from the country that, you know,
[3060.66 → 3065.06] did it or whatever. Like I could see Americans being all like rah, rah, rah, man on the moon or
[3065.06 → 3070.50] whatever. But I don't know that this is like a an astronaut on the moon kind of situation. Anyway,
[3070.50 → 3077.38] um, in part two of this discussion, Apple lets reader apps include a link to pay outside the
[3077.38 → 3082.66] app store in a move to shake off a Japanese investigation. So this we talked about last
[3082.66 → 3088.10] week. Yeah. So reader app is Apple's name for apps that simply give the user access to a library of
[3088.10 → 3092.74] content they have already purchased. So this includes Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle. Currently,
[3092.74 → 3099.38] these apps avoid Apple's 30% cut simply telling users that they can't make an account in the iOS app,
[3099.38 → 3104.50] but once they're a member, they can start using it. Uh, when this new policy is rolled out reader
[3104.50 → 3109.94] apps, but not games, because that would be too obvious, can link directly to their website instead
[3109.94 → 3114.82] of just vaguely alluding to it. Hold on one sec, one sec, one sec. It says currently these apps avoid
[3114.82 → 3123.54] Apple's 30% cut by simply telling users they can't make an account in the iOS app. No, you can't tell users.
[3123.54 → 3130.42] Oh, actually, obviously it's, it's changing, but you that's one of the biggest problems we had with
[3130.42 → 3134.10] it was as long as we could just tell people like, Oh yeah, you have to go to the website to make an
[3134.10 → 3139.22] account, or you have to go to the website to pay or something else. Like then that's fine. But you
[3139.22 → 3144.02] were not allowed to communicate these things. It was, it was really frustrating. They, they blocked
[3144.02 → 3147.46] our app and like some people have tweeted me and be like, no, this is fine. They're fine with this.
[3147.46 → 3151.38] They have blocked the float plane app from going to the store for us doing things like that in the
[3151.38 → 3156.98] past. Yeah. So yeah, I'm very happy things are changing, but like these are problems we've run
[3156.98 → 3162.82] into. Yeah. Um, Japan's fair trade commission says it will close its investigation of Apple,
[3162.82 → 3168.42] which has been ongoing since 2016 once Apple rolls out the policy. So here's what I want to know.
[3168.98 → 3174.34] Cause realistically Apple's just going to play whack-a-mole with this country by country until
[3174.34 → 3181.70] a major player moves. So is the U S Apple's home turf going to just step in and say, Hey,
[3182.42 → 3189.86] um, you guys need to stop doing this. Do you see it happening?
[3189.86 → 3198.66] I don't really. Um, if it happens in the U S I see it happening. Not for like in, in this case,
[3198.66 → 3204.26] it's, it's there. Ooh, I could be saying this wrong. President, is it president? Prime Minister?
[3204.26 → 3208.26] Not sure. Leader. It's their country leader. Head of state there. Sure.
[3208.26 → 3214.42] There's a generic term. Um, I believe it's the president. I don't see it happening
[3214.42 → 3218.90] through that avenue in the States. I see it happening through things like the epic
[3220.26 → 3225.54] thing that's going on. I see it happening from other companies and eventually becoming standard.
[3225.54 → 3228.50] Would you say precedence rather than presidents?
[3228.50 → 3235.22] Speaker 2 Oh yeah. I like that. But yes, I think it's, I think if it happens in the States,
[3235.22 → 3241.70] it would happen through precedence. But I don't know. I think I actually
[3241.70 → 3248.66] lean the other way. I think this is going to happen in the U S and I think that the U S has started to
[3248.66 → 3256.66] signal with, um, an FTC that is, you know, actually making public what they're, what they're talking
[3256.66 → 3262.42] about. I think the U S has started to signal that the free ride is over for big tech. They're certainly
[3262.42 → 3268.74] not moving as aggressively as China against big tech. Um, that's a whole boy, you know, you ever
[3268.74 → 3276.18] watch those, uh, those time lapses of like, you know, hospitals being just like conjured in China during the
[3276.18 → 3282.26] the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, like infrastructure projects. They're crazy.
[3282.26 → 3285.06] Speaker 2 Yeah. I don't know. They happen real fast in China.
[3285.06 → 3291.62] Speaker 2 They have shown like, oh yeah. Um, it's been a long time since we destroyed Microsoft.
[3291.62 → 3296.10] We, we have, we have teeth still, we've got some teeth, but I haven't really seen a lot of action.
[3296.10 → 3300.90] Personally, um, going after blizzard, like doesn't count in my opinion. Um,
[3300.90 → 3304.74] Speaker 2 That's, that's some really low-hanging fruit.
[3304.74 → 3306.10] Speaker 2 That's fair.
[3306.10 → 3309.78] Speaker 2 I don't know. Then I'm not saying they shouldn't have gone after blizzard.
[3309.78 → 3316.26] I'm just saying that isn't a sign of like, uh, a form of governance that's going to like really,
[3316.26 → 3322.50] really crack down on, on their, um, anti monopoly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, type of law stuff.
[3323.14 → 3329.38] Um, that's just going after a company that has some like, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah stuff.
[3329.38 → 3330.90] Speaker 2 That's pretty good.
[3330.90 → 3335.46] Speaker 2 In other Apple news, Apple's CSAM, CSAM, whatever you want to call it,
[3335.46 → 3340.82] detection system has been delayed. Uh, so last month, Apple announced two controversial features
[3340.82 → 3347.38] that would scan iPhones locally for child sexual abuse material or CSAM before uploading to their
[3347.38 → 3353.06] iCloud photos service. It would also alert parents when their children receive or send sexually explicit
[3353.06 → 3359.30] photos, and it would blur those images. With over 660 million paying subscribers and many more
[3359.30 → 3365.06] with free iCloud, this would affect many users because, uh, Jonathan Horst, our very own Apple
[3365.06 → 3371.22] correspondent learned in his iCloud video, iCloud photos is turned on by default when you set up
[3371.22 → 3376.82] any Apple mobile device. Today, they announced that they are delaying the rollout of these features.
[3376.82 → 3381.06] So in a statement to the verge, Apple said, based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,
[3381.06 → 3385.14] researchers, and others, we've decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect
[3385.14 → 3389.38] input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.
[3389.38 → 3394.66] So, well, I hope it wouldn't affect many users. Its this is worded in an interesting way because
[3394.66 → 3401.46] it's saying the whole CSAM thing, right? Um, in its current, and I know the last time we talked
[3401.46 → 3406.98] about this, we talked a lot about like, uh, the creep, like what continues to happen here, who's gonna
[3408.02 → 3413.54] basically inevitably be able to steal this tool and go through everyone's, uh, photos and stuff like that.
[3413.54 → 3419.06] So like, I'm not talking about that right now. I'm purely talking about its current intention and
[3419.06 → 3425.30] iteration and nothing else, not the ramifications, none of that kind of stuff. Um, it's saying this 660
[3425.30 → 3433.46] million paying subscribers, um, and more with free iCloud. This would affect many users again, hopefully
[3433.46 → 3441.30] not because it's just detecting child sexual photos. So hopefully it really doesn't affect very many users,
[3441.30 → 3449.78] but, um, I mean, it's obviously a bigger thing than it should be. And then you would like to think that it is. Um,
[3451.54 → 3456.66] what I want to know is if basically the only thing that's going to change is the way they're
[3456.66 → 3462.98] communicating it, because what it sounded like before was that your photos would kind of be like
[3462.98 → 3470.58] browsable to an Apple employee. Uh, but looking back at it now, it kind of sounds like that is not the
[3470.58 → 3475.54] case. So a lot of the confusion around this seems to boil down to where the scanning is taking place.
[3475.54 → 3480.10] So we know now it's happening locally and, um,
[3482.82 → 3489.78] man, you know what, here's what I'm going to call it here. I think Apple is going to change nothing.
[3489.78 → 3495.38] And they're going to announce, yep, never mind. We are, we are implementing this and most of the
[3495.38 → 3501.86] outrage will have died down and, um, it'll be yesterday's news and no one will talk about it.
[3501.86 → 3502.50] I'm calling it.
[3505.38 → 3510.98] Speaking of yesterday's news, it was actually two days ago. Um, a day off Twitch was a thing this
[3510.98 → 3511.94] week. Want to run us through it?
[3511.94 → 3519.86] Uh, the hashtag a day off Twitch campaign, uh, organized by streamers Raven, Luce, Lucia,
[3519.86 → 3527.78] Ever Black and Shiny Pen, Shiny Pen, Shiny Pen, uh, took place on September 1st in solidarity
[3527.78 → 3532.98] against the hate raids that are spreading across the Twitch platform. I just want to say I'm,
[3532.98 → 3536.82] it's been a while since this was launched, but I'm pretty sure we talked about this on WAN show.
[3536.82 → 3541.30] And I'm pretty sure we said exactly this was going to happen when they first set up the tagging system.
[3541.30 → 3546.18] Um, but let's, let's keep going through this. Um, harassment on streaming services is sadly
[3546.18 → 3550.90] nothing new. Creators are now finding themselves targeted with a new kind of attack called a hate
[3550.90 → 3556.02] raid in which they are flooded with new viewers and followers, but ones that are simply there to
[3556.02 → 3562.34] spam their streams with hate. Yeah. The hate raids are possibly the hate raids. It says possibly
[3562.34 → 3568.42] they're definitely a result of this. The hate raids are possibly a result of the platform expanding its
[3568.42 → 3576.26] tag list to include 350 tags classified by gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability,
[3576.26 → 3582.74] mental health, and more. It has made, uh, far easy, has made it far easier for racist trolls to find and
[3582.74 → 3588.74] harass creators. I'm pretty sure we talked about this on WAN show, and I'm pretty sure we said, wow, this is
[3588.74 → 3593.70] going to make it way easier for people to find the people that they want. So here's the problem is,
[3594.66 → 3604.02] you know, as a platform you're called upon to, uh, increase visibility of minorities and, and help
[3604.66 → 3610.50] amplify their voices. I'm definitely not saying that you shouldn't to be very clear. And, and, and that's a good thing.
[3610.50 → 3619.06] Um, but as, as Luke and I, I'm very sure discussed back when these changes were announced, um,
[3620.34 → 3627.78] how it was implemented. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I think what is, what's the word cringe?
[3628.50 → 3634.10] Is it cringe? Is there, is there a newer word? Yikes? Probably yikes would be a little bit of a fresh
[3634.10 → 3640.74] right. Yeah. I don't know. This was just the, the writing was on the wall for this. Like, like some,
[3640.74 → 3645.46] someone should have known at Twitch that this was going to happen the second someone suggested this
[3645.46 → 3650.42] idea. And that doesn't necessarily mean that they couldn't have done it, but they should have known
[3650.42 → 3657.78] it was coming and been very, very ready. Um, there's no way to be ready for something like that,
[3657.78 → 3662.74] though. The thing about live chat is we've been, we've been through this ourselves a hundred times is
[3662.74 → 3669.06] live chat is basically impossible to moderate on a platform at the same scale that Twitch is.
[3670.18 → 3675.86] Like when you have even let's say it's not a thousand people and some of these hate raids were
[3675.86 → 3684.10] enormous. If you have even a hundred people dropping into a stream, the chat gets moving superfast. The,
[3684.10 → 3689.70] yeah. Um, there's, there's so many of them. Like you think about how fast this could be moving with
[3689.70 → 3694.50] each of them, even, you know, typing every 15 seconds or 30 seconds, whatever the default chat
[3694.50 → 3700.66] settings are. Um, you know, that's good. That's a really awful experience, not just for the streamer,
[3700.66 → 3704.42] but even for the other people in the chat that don't want to see that and don't want to hear that.
[3704.42 → 3710.98] And the thing is really, really rough for moderators that like are a lot, a lot of these channels. And I'm
[3710.98 → 3717.38] saying this because the vast majority of channels on Twitch are very small. So I'm not, I'm not
[3717.38 → 3721.78] targeting this community and saying that their channels are small to be very clear, but just
[3721.78 → 3726.74] if you're a channel on Twitch, the likeliness is you're a small channel on Twitch. Um, I'm a small
[3726.74 → 3733.06] channel on Twitch. Um, the, the, the vast majority of the moderators and, and even then it's, it's going
[3733.06 → 3737.62] to be moderators and streamers that haven't dealt with that much activity before. So they're going to be
[3737.62 → 3741.86] overwhelmed, and it's going to be very difficult for them to act. It's extremely difficult to
[3741.86 → 3747.14] moderate a live chat. Um, especially with a group of people that is probably used to just kind of
[3747.14 → 3751.06] hanging out with their friends, having a good time and not dealing with this type of onslaught.
[3752.02 → 3757.54] And there are other problems with it. So, uh, if you're offline, um, it can flag your account
[3757.54 → 3762.26] and Twitch can end up auto banning small users. This was pointed out by Image over in the float plane chat.
[3762.74 → 3766.74] Um, and there's some, you know, some people are saying, you know, oh, well,
[3766.74 → 3773.62] the obvious way to fight this is a follower mode only, or even subscriber only chat. But the thing is,
[3773.62 → 3778.74] again, if you're a small channel, which is who these people are targeting, right?
[3780.42 → 3786.66] You can't afford to turn off your chat, right? Because you're effectively, sorry, keep going.
[3786.66 → 3792.98] Yeah. You're effectively turning it into, uh, just a conversation between a handful of people. Like
[3792.98 → 3799.86] that's not, that's really difficult to engage with because a lot of the a lot of what's so great
[3800.42 → 3806.74] about Twitch highlights is the interaction between these huge streamers and their enormous fan bases.
[3806.74 → 3812.82] You know, they do something and chat explodes, right? You will never have that unless you,
[3813.38 → 3819.22] unless you are an enormous personality on the platform, if you limit who can talk in your chat. So
[3819.22 → 3827.62] basically they're forcing you to either, um, just deal with the abuse or remain obscure forever
[3827.62 → 3833.14] because you have no chat to interact with, and you can't, like, you can't really get into a rhythm.
[3833.94 → 3840.02] Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's really rough. And, and a lot of the verbiage that we've used is,
[3840.58 → 3846.66] is people. We've been saying it like a lot of people are coming to raid your, your stream. In some,
[3846.66 → 3852.50] I would wager a lot of these situations. Most of the people aren't people, they're bots.
[3853.14 → 3857.06] Um, I mean, same could be said of just viewers on Twitch. Got them.
[3857.86 → 3862.82] Got them. Um, and like if you, if you switch your channel to follower only chat,
[3862.82 → 3869.22] yeah, 10,000 bots can click follow real easy. Um, it's, it's not, it's not going to matter. I, it's,
[3869.22 → 3875.94] it's rough. Um, there's, there's a there's a point here that says current hate raters use
[3876.58 → 3881.46] one email address to register unlimited accounts. Wouldn't it be simple to limit this and make
[3881.46 → 3886.82] batting that much harder? Um, I'm going to insert some text here by making so that you have to have
[3886.82 → 3894.02] unique email addresses. Um, yeah, but you can also like bucket, create a very large amount of email
[3894.02 → 3904.66] addresses all in one big swoop. Um, so that is only going to stop very, uh, not high-end attack.
[3904.66 → 3911.94] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So there will still be hate raids with that system. Um, the whole thing is just,
[3913.22 → 3916.18] they, they should have found a different solution that wasn't tags.
[3916.18 → 3924.42] Pretty much. Yep. Um, you know, to be honest though, it's tough because I don't actually have
[3924.42 → 3928.50] a better solution off the top of my head. Truthfully.
[3930.34 → 3938.10] Uh, well, if, if you want to like, yeah, making it easier to the, the, the path of making it easier
[3938.10 → 3944.26] so that if you, uh, want users to be able to come to Twitch and go, I want to find a creator of this type
[3944.90 → 3950.98] and then find them. Yeah. That's going to be pretty difficult. Um, but you can still promote
[3950.98 → 3955.94] those users with, with more, more exposure to the front page. Actually, I have a better solution already.
[3956.74 → 3963.54] Um, so yes, you can, you can do what you were doing, but one of the ways that YouTube, um, curates
[3963.54 → 3969.30] your experience on the platform is they ask you questions about what you're consuming. So when you,
[3969.30 → 3975.46] when you watch a, a video, it'll give you like a survey that you can respond to,
[3975.46 → 3979.62] to say what you liked about it. I found it really engaging, or I found it funny, or I found this,
[3979.62 → 3985.62] or I found that. Um, and so, you know, something you could do is, and this would make it a lot easier
[3985.62 → 3994.10] to filter out bots before they can actually do any damage is over time as a user, an actual user
[3994.10 → 4000.02] interacts with content. You could ask them questions about the experience that would eventually guide you
[4000.02 → 4010.18] to an algorithmic, um, predisposition for this user to, uh, to expose them to these, uh, to this kind of
[4010.18 → 4015.70] every type of creator they're looking for. Yeah. More niche creators or, uh, these particular groups. And
[4016.34 → 4024.66] it's a longer, it's a longer term fix, but I think it's also a better one, uh, for it's, it's a better one
[4024.66 → 4029.86] for both the creators and for the people who are looking for them to just sort of naturally be
[4029.86 → 4036.26] recommended people that you might find a connection with. Um, it's, it's a difficult, it's a difficult
[4036.26 → 4043.86] thing, but yeah, but it's, well within Amazon's capabilities, like to be clear, we're not suggesting
[4043.86 → 4048.02] a solution that we could build. We don't have the engineering to build something like that, but
[4048.66 → 4055.54] let's not kid ourselves. Amazon absolutely can. If Amazon can manage to, you know, try to recommend
[4055.54 → 4059.54] you something to buy before you've ever even heard it, I'm sure they can figure out who you might like
[4059.54 → 4068.58] to watch on Twitch. So yeah, no, this is not some kind of impossible mountain to climb. It's just a
[4068.58 → 4077.38] really, really terrible, terrible implementation. And the thing is like, I, it's not like I take any
[4077.38 → 4083.70] pleasure from saying, I told you so on this one, this sucks. No, this does suck. And you know,
[4084.58 → 4090.74] it's just yet another, it's just yet another reason for people who are already feeling disenfranchised to
[4090.74 → 4096.82] feel discriminated against. It's, it's adding insult to injury. It's, it's, and it's just for me,
[4096.82 → 4104.98] for me, for me, one of the biggest modifiers, um, you know, for how bad I will feel about something
[4104.98 → 4113.70] is how unnecessary it is. You know, when, um, when, when someone, when someone, um,
[4113.70 → 4122.34] um, you know, when someone dies because they selflessly sacrifice themselves to save 10,000
[4122.34 → 4128.98] other people, you know what I mean? Um, that's really sad, but some, some good came out of it,
[4128.98 → 4133.38] right? Like it was, it, it feels like there was something on the other side of this equation that
[4133.38 → 4136.58] was like, Oh, but this was necessary. This is how it can be justified.
[4136.58 → 4143.14] Sadness is also not like essentially the only way to respond. Like you, you can be very anger out of,
[4143.14 → 4148.42] you can be very, yeah, out of that person. Yeah. Like you can, it's, it's a very honourable act.
[4148.42 → 4153.38] Like you can respect things like that. Yeah. But then you look at something like the Sandy Hook massacre
[4153.38 → 4161.30] and you go, it was just utterly unnecessary, you know? Um, and, and, and I, I, obviously it's,
[4161.30 → 4166.34] it'd be hard to come up with any good reason why a small child should die. Um,
[4166.34 → 4174.34] but I can't think of, I certainly can't think of a, a, a worse one than for no reason whatsoever.
[4175.06 → 4179.94] Um, so, you know, for me, that's, that's the thing that makes this kind of hate
[4180.82 → 4187.54] so much more offensive is how utterly unnecessary it is. The way that the people doing this are going
[4187.54 → 4193.38] out of their way. Like, it's not there, you're, you're walking. It's like, it's like you're walking
[4193.38 → 4198.26] on opposite sides of the street, right? And there's like, it's a busy street full of cars
[4198.26 → 4202.98] and you're like, you're, you're dodging in and out of traffic so you can go and bother somebody
[4202.98 → 4206.26] who's just walking down the street. Take a look at it.
[4206.26 → 4208.98] And hang out with their friends, play some video games or do whatever else. And you're
[4208.98 → 4215.62] just ruining their day. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, it sucks. Whole thing sucks. Yep.
[4215.62 → 4222.98] Uh, in other news, Hey, we've got a big event coming up. Um, this is not necessary,
[4222.98 → 4230.02] but it's a good thing. So it's good. We are doing another game show this time. It is going to be PC
[4230.02 → 4238.18] or no PC, uh, loosely inspired by deal or no deal. We are looking for two awesome people to be
[4238.18 → 4245.54] contestants, uh, on September 16th in the Langley, Surrey area in British Columbia. But instead,
[4245.54 → 4254.34] of money in the, in the cases, we are going to have tech slash server slash PC hardware for people
[4254.34 → 4261.22] to potentially win. You have to be 18 or over live in BC, Canada, and you must be vaccinated to attend.
[4261.22 → 4265.94] We will ask for proof of vaccination. If you are interested, you can sign up through the link below,
[4265.94 → 4271.06] or you can find the link on a tweet that we posted yesterday. I look forward very much
[4271.06 → 4277.94] to seeing you there, and it is going to be a lot of fun. Super chats. Uh, yeah, I think other than
[4277.94 → 4281.94] that, that pretty much wraps it. I missed some of the early ones because YouTube still hasn't fixed
[4281.94 → 4288.18] that bug. See, look, this is as high as I can go. How stupid is that? Anyway, the point is Red Wolf.
[4288.18 → 4293.54] I recently bought the last 3080 at my local micro centre, three hours away only for it to be a lemon.
[4293.54 → 4298.18] And I've sent it to Gigabyte and got it back with no fix. What should I do? Well, you should RMA it again
[4298.18 → 4304.82] because, um, or you should figure out why they don't think it's broken. That is under warranty. So
[4304.82 → 4310.50] it shouldn't be a problem for you to get it fixed. Uh, if a Gigabyte won't help you, micro centre should,
[4311.46 → 4316.98] especially if it was broken right away. Like you say, it was a lemon. Uh, Le says the gaming limit
[4316.98 → 4323.22] in China is actually part of a larger effort of making educating your kids easier along with things
[4323.22 → 4329.38] like banning tutoring schools. The end goal is encouraging people to have more kids. That is a
[4329.38 → 4333.14] fascinating way to go about achieving that goal. I wish them the best of luck.
[4333.14 → 4339.38] But this is kind of what I was talking about on that subject though, is like, there's, there's so
[4339.38 → 4343.86] much we're ignorant to when it comes to China in general. So any of these policy things like,
[4343.86 → 4349.62] yeah, it sounds whack to me, but like, I don't necessarily know. And like, I don't think there
[4349.62 → 4354.42] is a lot of, I don't know. I like more freedom and autonomy and blah, blah, blah, blah. But like,
[4355.30 → 4358.58] I don't know what's behind it. I don't know what the reasons are for it. I don't know what the
[4358.58 → 4362.90] the social situations are there that are like, I don't like, there are so many variables that are up
[4362.90 → 4374.50] in the air. Yeah. Um, man, there's any number of reasons that they might be banning these, uh,
[4374.50 → 4379.14] tutoring schools. Uh, Nixon says, my brother's in Canada and he's your biggest fan. Hey, sweet.
[4380.02 → 4384.58] Um, CS says, Hey, I'm a big fan. I'm trying to build my first PC, but I live in an apartment with
[4384.58 → 4388.42] carpet floor. How should I go about building the PC without damaging my parts from ESD?
[4388.98 → 4393.38] Uh, well, what we learned in our collab with Electro Boom is that it's actually really hard
[4393.38 → 4400.58] to damage your parts with the SD. So there's that. Also, if you watch the first person view build guide,
[4400.58 → 4409.38] it's this one right here. First person, oops, fist person, first person build a PC. Uh, this one right
[4409.38 → 4416.58] here. First person, PC build guide POV. I go through all the steps that you need to protect yourself from
[4416.58 → 4421.38] zapping your components in that one. Uh, RS Dragonfly says, it's not games that negatively
[4421.38 → 4425.38] affect mental health. Chinese parents fail miserably at giving their children a meaningful life. What
[4425.38 → 4429.14] are you even talking about? Why did I even read this chat? That's some really, that's a really stupid
[4429.14 → 4443.06] chat. See you later. Um, uh, Apt Vesalius says, I did my master's thesis on video game culture.
[4443.06 → 4446.98] There are numerous studies all pointing toward positive in video games that dwarf the negatives.
[4447.54 → 4453.22] Yeah, that's fair enough. Um, you might make the argument that some of the positives we've gained
[4453.22 → 4458.26] from video games might be unnecessary if we were just all outside interacting with each other more.
[4458.26 → 4464.10] So also, also in what amount, right? Because they can still play for an hour a day.
[4464.10 → 4470.42] Yeah. Which is actually like kind of a fair amount of time for a little pretty major. Yeah. Um,
[4472.98 → 4479.38] Kang You says the problem is that, uh, in China, giant game companies are promoting games solely on
[4479.38 → 4482.74] microtransactions that kids would spend their family savings on it. Yeah, that's fair enough.
[4483.38 → 4487.54] There's already a limit on how much they can spend. Yeah. That was already a thing back in 2019.
[4487.54 → 4493.22] Yeah. Ran Marie says, to Linus, when are you cutting the beard off? I missed my twink Linus. Well,
[4493.78 → 4498.66] if to transform into twink Linus is the only reason to do it, I don't know if that's a very compelling
[4498.66 → 4506.66] argument. Uh, Josh says, just here to say Australia needs to rebel in the name of freedom. Um, rebel.
[4506.66 → 4508.34] Rebel against what?
[4512.58 → 4517.54] Do you have any idea what that, what the context is for that? Nope. Uh, when you first started talking
[4517.54 → 4521.38] about that, I was assuming he was going to be talking about internet connections because I very
[4521.38 → 4527.54] recently, uh, checked how much we pay, uh, to get people float plane in Australia. And it made me,
[4527.54 → 4534.50] um, very sad. So I thought he was talking about that. Oh, got it. All right. Uh,
[4535.62 → 4539.78] genius. Uh, okay. Next man, what is with these super chats today?
[4542.34 → 4548.90] Okay. Yeah. Uh, Kang You says it's a it's called a pull card scheme game, similar to loot boxes. Okay.
[4548.90 → 4553.70] So this is elaborating on that. Uh, David Villa says, got a really sick email from Nick light about
[4553.70 → 4556.98] my LTT store account. Just want to let you guys know you make great stuff and have great service.
[4556.98 → 4564.98] Thanks. Can't wait for the screwdriver. Heck yeah. Heck yeah. Heck yeah. Um, okay. Well,
[4567.54 → 4568.66] yeah. Uh,
[4571.86 → 4575.86] Kinetic says it's an important and well-meaning thing, but the part that always annoys me about a
[4575.86 → 4580.66] day off Twitch and other social media blackouts is it gets to the day and people are mad because
[4580.66 → 4584.50] Aussies are streaming because time zones. Yeah, that's, uh, that's a pretty good point.
[4586.66 → 4591.78] And I guess that's pretty much it for the WAN show today. Uh, Raphael says, I bought a sad Linus
[4591.78 → 4596.74] desk pad. It is dog. Hey, as long as it doesn't destroy your desk, like it did with, uh, Quinn.
[4597.94 → 4605.70] Did you see, did you see snazzy? Okay. It's bad. It's bad. Okay. So one day. Okay.
[4605.86 → 4615.78] One day installs a sad Linus desk pad. Okay. Next day desk destroyed. Coincidence? I think not.
[4618.82 → 4621.86] So you just be careful. Okay. That quality, it's heavy.
[4621.86 → 4628.50] Sad Linus has evolved into angry Linus. All right. We'll see you guys next week. Same bad time,
[4628.50 → 4642.50] same bad channel. Bye.
