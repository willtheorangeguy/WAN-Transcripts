• A non-tech publication has published a review of Intel's upcoming Rocket Lake 11 700k processor, nearly two weeks early.
• The reviewer obtained the processor by buying it from a European retailer for around $469 USD.
• Anandtech also reviewed the Intel Core i7 11 700k, claiming to have bought it from a European retailer and stating that they might not be bound by the NDA due to the embargo being lifted if the information was already public.
• The discussion touches on NDAs and their implications for product embargoes and reviews.
• The host mentions some unrelated topics, including Google's new focus on privacy, an Arizona house bill requiring allowance for third-party payments on app platforms, and the Verified Actual Gamer program.
• The reviewer expresses frustration with Intel for releasing review units to MindFactory.de, a small retailer, instead of media outlets.
• Intel sold only around 5600 Core i7 11700K CPUs in the product's lifetime and yet they are now scarce.
• The reviewer believes that media outlets should be given review units before retailers, to ensure accurate reviews and prevent "back alley contacts" from selling the products early.
• Intel's inability to prevent unauthorized sales of their products is criticized by the reviewer.
• The reviewer mentions a past incident with the RTX 3090 where they were able to publish a review quickly due to having access to the product early.
• The reviewer is still under NDA for the 11700K and cannot comment on its performance or price.
• The reviewer explains the nuances of NDAs, including not being able to disclose embargo lift times or share their own benchmarks.

• The current state of GPU prices is chaotic, with new GPUs like the RTX 3060 selling for over $1,000 on eBay.
• The speaker suggests it's a "buyer's market" and that manufacturers are launching new products despite not being able to meet demand for previous ones.
• The idea is floated that manufacturers may have planned ahead and already committed to launch new products, even if they can't deliver them at MSRP.
• A new program called "Verified Actual Gamer" is announced, where a limited number of GPUs will be made available to actual gamers at a lower price point than scalpers.
• The program is in collaboration with ASUS and MSI, and the speaker claims there's a high probability that every GPU sold through this program will go to an actual gamer.
