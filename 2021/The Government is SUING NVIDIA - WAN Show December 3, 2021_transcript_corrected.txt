[0.00 → 13.98] oh we're live oh welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined
[13.98 → 24.48] up for you all today the FTC is suing to block the 40 billion Nvidia and ARM merger whoops
[24.48 → 30.42] and the Google Pixel 6 is apparently refusing to charge with low quality cables it's all like
[30.42 → 37.24] what's the matter you poor well I guess no charge for you what else we got today or new phone uh
[37.24 → 42.52] Apple that's screwed with us and in a really annoying way and I want to talk about it on
[42.52 → 49.00] WAN show because I'm actually just so mad I'm so upset what are you upset about I told you earlier
[49.00 → 57.46] today okay all right yeah we should talk about that I'm so cheesed I'm also uh Nvidia rumoured to
[57.46 → 64.66] launch RTX 40 series in 2022 just another generation of graphics cards you won't be able to get wow
[64.66 → 67.84] so um get wrecked I guess very cool
[79.00 → 95.48] and the show is brought to you by i the agent team group and MSI all right why don't we jump
[95.48 → 102.86] right into our first topic of the day the FTC is suing to block the 40 billion Nvidia and ARM merger
[102.86 → 109.24] that's right they've stepped in to prevent Nvidia from snapping up ARM to prevent Nvidia from
[109.24 → 115.70] stifling the innovation pipeline for next generation technologies that that is a quote
[115.70 → 122.06] this FTC complaint alleges that the proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive
[122.06 → 126.66] to use its control of this technology to undermine its competitors reducing competition
[126.66 → 132.44] and ultimately resulting in reduced product quality reduced innovation higher prices and less
[132.44 → 139.42] choice that is um that is one way of putting it yeah according to the complaint the acquisition will
[139.42 → 144.72] harm competition in three worldwide markets in which Nvidia competes using ARM-based products
[144.72 → 150.82] already through the license that they have high level advanced driver assistance systems for passenger
[150.82 → 155.66] cars, so these offer computer assisted driving functions like automated lane changing lane keeping
[155.66 → 161.32] highway entrance and exit collision prevention on that kind of thing DPU smart NIC's which are advanced
[161.32 → 166.30] networking products that are used to increase the security and efficiency of data centre servers and
[166.30 → 172.12] ARM-based CPUs for cloud computing service providers so these new and emerging products leverage
[172.12 → 177.80] ARM's technology to meet the performance power efficiency and customizability needs of modern data centres that
[177.80 → 184.60] provide cloud computing services so for example uh Amazon is working on not just working on Amazon has rolled out
[184.60 → 193.24] ARM-based server processors that are reducing their dependence on traditional x86 vendors like AMD and Intel in fact the ARM ecosystem is
[193.24 → 206.60] arguably as vibrant as it has ever been everything from the watch on your wrist to the huge metal servers that are running all the cloud infrastructure that powers the services that you use is
[206.60 → 228.60] are running on ARM probably at this point, so the proposed deal would give Nvidia control over computing technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop competing chips see that's the thing Nvidia has a huge presence both ARM and otherwise in
[228.60 → 256.60] in at least two of these markets so through the Eleanor acquisition they've definitely got something going on in the data centre networking space I don't know if they're actually developing DPU smart NIC's it's a space that I'm just frankly not familiar with but when it comes to driver assistance systems acceleration they've definitely got their fingers in that pot and when it comes to cloud computing absolutely they've got their fingers in that pot and when it comes to cloud computing absolutely they've got their fingers in that pot and when it comes to cloud computing
[256.60 → 280.60] absolutely they've got their fingers in that pot and when it comes to cloud computing absolutely they've got their fingers in that pot as well, so this is a pretty cut and dried example of a non-competitive behaviour buying the company that controls the IP that your rivals rely on however Nvidia has claimed Nvidia has claimed Nvidia has claimed that this wouldn't be a problem
[280.60 → 295.78] There's going some state not to them a problem and that's a huge is within that part that they've been able to keep it going nuts think it'll, and we can flip it out to Facebook
[296.44 → 299.60] but here we're gonna super you guys Ben't you guys Enjoy.
[301.66 → 310.58] For me the CECOM
[310.58 → 314.90] playing nice guys when they're in that situation and this would just make them even more so
[314.90 → 322.44] so here's the thing I actually wrote a follow-up video I didn't write the whole thing i I wrote
[322.44 → 330.32] most of it uh let me just see if I'm logged into the right doc here um i I created a bunch of
[330.32 → 336.30] notes for a video that I was going to call something along the lines of like NVIDIA why
[336.30 → 343.42] are you so mad you know um like or like oh no, no i remember what it was going to be
[343.42 → 350.68] called it was going to be called who hurt you and basically most of the most of the thinking that i
[350.68 → 357.26] was doing about it was really along the lines of you know I understand at some point a very
[357.26 → 363.36] long time ago you were uh you were a scrappy you know a scrappy desperate competitor and you kind
[363.36 → 371.94] of had to leverage every possible angle in order to succeed but yeah that was at this point
[371.94 → 379.88] really a very long time ago and at some point don't you think you would like to just be liked
[379.88 → 387.00] you know at some point isn't it time to realize that you're not punching up any more you're punching
[387.00 → 394.34] down, and it's its time to take a more magnanimous approach to your dealings with the rest of the
[394.34 → 400.38] industry because and it was actually it was inspired partially by NVIDIA's behaviour towards hardware
[400.38 → 405.70] unbox, so this was back when that whole thing unfolded, but it was also inspired partially by the
[405.70 → 413.02] uh at the time regulatory resistance and not just regulatory but also industry resistance
[413.02 → 421.60] to NVIDIA's I think at the time alleged acquisition of arm maybe it wasn't maybe it wasn't alleged um
[421.60 → 427.20] here I've actually okay I've got my I've got my notes up unfortunately this particular computer
[427.20 → 435.38] does not have um oh boy well that's a little uncomfortable this computer doesn't have word on it
[435.38 → 441.12] so that's what that's what opening this document looks like I'm sure someone's going to manage to turn
[441.12 → 450.10] that into oh come on why does WordPad not even show like this is the kind of stuff you know i I've
[450.10 → 455.84] done a lot of complaining about Linux in the last few weeks, but this is the kind of stuff that windows
[455.84 → 465.60] absolutely needs to do better why is it that by default in windows open with does not bring up
[465.60 → 476.76] WordPad which will open this document here it is okay here it is why would it not just default to this
[476.76 → 483.24] view rather than what we saw before I don't know uh Luke do you mind curating a couple of merch messages
[483.24 → 492.06] while I go through this so here is pretty much what I wanted to say about it um oh man
[492.06 → 503.14] uh yeah no one would talk on record um i I wanted to kind of say like hey you know let's look at your
[503.14 → 506.90] financials let's look at your market share your public company right, so this is all stuff
[506.90 → 512.42] that we have access to look at current growth, and you know I there's a there's a bit that I've kind of
[512.42 → 517.62] written here and I go I get it only the paranoid survive, but there's a limit you can't and probably
[517.62 → 525.36] don't even want to win 100 market share so why is your grip so tight you know um let's not pretend
[525.36 → 529.06] this pressure on the media through hardware unboxed was somehow an isolated incident right
[529.06 → 535.78] the difference is just that most of the pressure NVIDIA applies to partners be they press partners
[535.78 → 542.58] or be the other partners it happens behind the scenes where the those partners are far more
[542.58 → 548.20] susceptible to the kind of damage that NVIDIA can deal than independent media who more and more are
[548.20 → 552.60] getting funded directly by their viewers um I have in here massive shout out by the way to my float
[552.60 → 559.26] plane peeps and of course ltdstore.com shoppers so it comes across petty emotional and scared like are
[559.26 → 565.42] you really so insecure that when you're in a position of unassailable power in the industry that you need to
[565.42 → 569.90] put down everyone else who thrives in your ecosystem to reassure yourself you're the top dog
[569.90 → 577.36] you're the top dog I said it so can we put it behind us now right so basically I wrote a video
[577.36 → 586.70] that was kind of a lot of that and I'm reminded of it now as we look at this kind of regulatory
[586.70 → 592.50] pushback because it doesn't come from nowhere it comes from this history of behaviour that NVIDIA has
[592.50 → 596.78] where every time they have an opportunity whatever they might say about how they're going to encourage
[596.78 → 601.82] a vibrant independent arm ecosystem nobody believes them they don't believe them because that's not
[601.82 → 608.60] what NVIDIA does NVIDIA create closed standards they create closed ecosystems they box out competitors
[608.60 → 618.94] at every possible opportunity so i just I get it I understand why the FTC is coming at them on this
[618.94 → 625.16] I also understand why there's been a lot of pushbacks not just from companies that NVIDIA has been
[625.16 → 632.60] openly hostile towards like apple but also companies that are just worried that whether it's immediate
[632.60 → 639.14] or whether it's over an extended period of time complete NVIDIA ownership and control over arm sip
[639.14 → 646.78] could have lasting and damaging impacts on their business and that's honestly why arm has been so
[646.78 → 653.22] successful that's what's allowed it to proliferate is that they have created this really amazing business
[653.22 → 659.46] model where you can license their technology in almost every way you could possibly imagine
[659.46 → 665.70] literally actually in every way you could possibly imagine from just taking course that they've designed
[665.70 → 672.02] and essentially paying to have them fab all the way to taking the underlying architecture designing
[672.02 → 677.30] your own core and I mean look at what apple's done with that they've they've managed to comp they've
[677.30 → 683.94] managed to out compete the entire rest of the industry with an underlying fundamental IP that anyone can
[683.94 → 691.46] license I mean it's incredible right and so why are we why are we going to risk damaging a good thing i
[691.46 → 701.70] guess is the question I mean really risk five is coming yeah risk five is coming for arms lunch already so do we
[701.70 → 707.70] do we kind of coming for a long time but do we need to do we need to accelerate that transition
[708.26 → 712.90] because that's what I feel like might happen if NVIDIA were to acquire arm I feel like
[713.62 → 722.02] a lot of these licensees of arms technology would just go okay well writing's on the wall now I guess it's
[722.02 → 728.66] time for us to go ahead and someone in flow plane chat said as you were kind of transitioning into that
[728.66 → 734.18] um I think possibly before you mentioned risk they said risk five would get really popular if arm gets
[734.18 → 742.66] sold it's like yeah potentially pretty much but it costs so much and it takes so much time to make
[742.66 → 749.78] these major transitions you guys gotta understand hardware is just such a small piece of the puzzle
[749.78 → 757.06] these days it's all about the software and so if Amazon had to go you know whether it's Amazon or Facebook
[757.06 → 763.38] or google or whoever it is if they have to go and switch architectures like this okay we're going
[763.38 → 769.70] risk five now it's not just as simple as okay compile the code for risk five and here we go
[770.50 → 778.74] not by a long shot so much optimization takes place these days, and it would, I mean it's a years and many
[778.74 → 783.54] many millions of dollars investment to do something like this so honestly i know I'm all about
[783.54 → 790.18] progress in general, but maybe we could just arms now you know swinging for the fences why don't
[790.18 → 798.42] we let it just be for a little bit I don't I don't think not wanting some gigantic conglomerate company to
[798.98 → 804.42] gobble up another company I don't think that's anti-progress I think you're right I'm all right i
[804.42 → 807.94] think you're right all right I'm coming I'm coming away okay on this one yeah, yeah so
[807.94 → 817.54] I guess we'll see what happens I guess we'll see what happens um I mean the FTC I don't think is the
[817.54 → 824.26] only ones resisting this move so why don't we move on to our next topic this one's pretty funny
[824.26 → 829.94] the Google Pixel 6 refuses to charge with low quality cable, so there have been numerous reports
[829.94 → 835.30] from users on Google's forums that reveal the latest pixel phones refuse to charge but only under specific
[835.30 → 840.58] circumstances and at the heart of the issue appears to be the quality of the type c cables being used
[841.46 → 846.90] so lower quality type c cables and chargers incapable of power delivery appear to be incapable
[846.90 → 854.18] of pushing any charge to the devices and the really frustrating thing is that while on Google's support
[854.18 → 859.70] page it is stated that pixel phones might not work with some cables in order to protect the battery from
[859.70 → 865.54] the damage that out of spec charging might cause there doesn't appear to be any meaningful error
[865.54 → 873.38] message that really gets pushed out to users it doesn't say hey get more money buy a better cable
[873.38 → 878.50] it just doesn't work doesn't work there's also a note here that i was kind of searching for
[878.50 → 885.14] and I strongly agree with on cable labelling is extremely uncommon these days it's not like Ethernet back in
[885.14 → 889.94] the day when every single one had the printing across the entire cable they still do Ethernet does
[889.94 → 894.66] yeah pretty much all of them I've seen yep okay sweet anyway USB not so much no I don't think i
[894.66 → 901.86] have a single labelled USB cable um I'm I'm sure people out there do it's very likely I think on the
[901.86 → 907.22] plug itself you might have a little stamp that indicates what it is but like on USB yeah I've never
[907.22 → 913.94] seen it no yeah no I don't know no i I haven't seen labelling at all so like figuring this out as a layman
[913.94 → 920.18] would be very annoying pretty much the only way that I can tell if it's wired for USB 2 or USB 3
[920.18 → 926.18] is just by the thickness of the cable and even that's not a surefire thing because it could
[926.18 → 931.06] just have a really thick sheath on you know five conductors or I guess i I don't know I guess it would
[931.06 → 938.66] be nine or whatever it would be for reversibility um and the thing is that in addition
[938.66 → 943.62] to just how many conductors are running down a type c cable there's also the gauge of them right
[943.62 → 949.94] so especially as we get into I think we've got 100 watt now but as we get into 240 watt power
[949.94 → 956.66] delivery over USB type c that is going to be really important, and it's actually a really great safety
[956.66 → 961.30] feature that google has that it just prevents the phone from operating correctly with a cable that
[961.30 → 967.22] could damage if it's just that they need to do a better job of documenting what's happening or alerting
[967.22 → 972.58] the user to what's happening so that people don't get confused all right let's go ahead and roll this
[975.06 → 979.94] oh wow that's actually a perfect question go ahead and do that okay I think I'm going to have to
[979.94 → 984.26] just call this out because otherwise we're going to run into trouble here and people aren't going to get a
[984.26 → 994.58] chance to get their hands on it um the swacked oh that's not it the swacked is back ladies and
[994.58 → 1002.26] gentlemen that's right it's somewhere between a sweater and a jacket so it's a heavy sweater
[1002.26 → 1009.78] and I've got a large on long story it is not going to fit this Maggie uh normally our size medium is my
[1009.78 → 1017.54] size, but this is pretty much the LTT store hoodie for if you don't want the stealth hoodie or the wan
[1017.54 → 1024.98] hoodie you know you want something that's a little more flash um it's got the reflective tape
[1024.98 → 1031.62] on the front uh reflective tape on the back it's got the big LTT badge on the shoulder very much inspired
[1031.62 → 1039.54] by the original swacked but uh without some of the uh questionable choices that we made the first
[1039.54 → 1046.02] time around in terms of materials, so there should be a lot better consistency from one garment to the
[1046.02 → 1051.06] next this time around that is that a larger a XL is a XL that's a XL yeah that looks about right
[1052.26 → 1058.02] all right I never had the original one this is cool really you never got one nope oh yeah we had a very
[1058.02 → 1063.22] limited number of the original one, and then we never reordered because we had QC issues with them and
[1063.22 → 1068.34] that that factory just couldn't manage to make them, and it turned out it wasn't entirely their fault
[1068.34 → 1072.02] because we had like stretchy materials and really stiff materials, and they were right next to each
[1072.02 → 1082.50] other, and it was just an extremely technical garment so all right let's go ahead and do that
[1082.50 → 1086.26] I'll go through these if you want to transition to the next one yeah fantastic let's jump into our next
[1086.26 → 1092.58] topic of the day here what chip shortage hey it's more NVIDIA news NVIDIA is rumoured to be launching
[1092.58 → 1100.66] RTX 40 series cards in 2022 I mean the reality of it is NVIDIA would have started work on 40 series
[1100.66 → 1104.98] what is this add a love lace I guess is the code name for these upcoming ones can't remember
[1104.98 → 1110.02] the point is NVIDIA would have started planning for these you know probably three and a half
[1110.02 → 1115.38] years ago so they would have had absolutely no way of knowing that they were going to have no way of
[1115.38 → 1121.70] manufacturing enough of their previous generation to the point where they're only competing against
[1122.42 → 1128.10] nobody like there's literally no GPUs that anyone could buy anyway, so there's no point putting all
[1128.10 → 1133.38] this r d into releasing a new generation of that being said and i meted on it a little bit for consumers
[1134.34 → 1138.42] I'm still happy they're pushing forward at the very least yeah this is one of those situations where
[1138.42 → 1142.74] I don't want to bash on progress even if they're just instantly selling out you might as well keep
[1142.74 → 1145.94] marching forward yeah yeah you might as well keep marching forward it's just from a business
[1145.94 → 1152.34] standpoint if they just didn't have to yeah then I guess that is a thing that they might have I guess
[1152.34 → 1157.06] I guess I appreciate yeah that they're releasing a new one if they're moving because they could just not
[1157.94 → 1165.14] not really in the data centre they've still got a lot of competition for like high performance computing
[1165.14 → 1170.26] okay that's fair and that is like that's where NVIDIA is pushing they're pushing heavy in AI right now
[1170.26 → 1175.38] and there are AI specific processors that are coming out now that really look like they're going
[1175.38 → 1180.90] to take the fight to NVIDIA so if they're not continuing to push forward on new process nodes
[1180.90 → 1186.26] new architectures there is the potential that they could fall behind and once they've done that work
[1186.26 → 1194.10] it is relatively speaking less work to take these new innovations and repackage them into a smaller die
[1194.10 → 1201.86] and deliver them in a consumer GPU and NVIDIA is a proud company I think it's fair to say that NVIDIA
[1201.86 → 1207.54] is a proud company, and they would much rather beat the living stuffing out of their competition than
[1207.54 → 1216.74] just barely eke out a w so as much as we might fault NVIDIA from time to time whether it's for you know
[1216.74 → 1222.74] holding back a release because they don't have a financial incentive to go ahead with it, they never hold
[1222.74 → 1231.46] back for that long even during periods of completely uh of complete dominance in the GPU space they have
[1232.18 → 1238.18] eventually released more GPUs for you to spend your hard-earned money on even if they really you know
[1238.18 → 1245.54] frame these releases in the context of um NVIDIA targeting its own former customers who own their one
[1245.54 → 1252.34] or two generations ago GPUs as they tended to do towards the I guess the latter years of your
[1252.34 → 1258.18] tenure reviewing GPUs here where they would just say okay yeah this GPU we're going after everyone
[1258.18 → 1264.10] who owns one of these cards from three years ago or whatever the case may be yeah that was super common
[1264.74 → 1271.06] I mean a better solution would obviously be for NVIDIA to just turn GPUs into a subscription server oh they
[1271.06 → 1281.62] did hey why not both right if I'm Jensen i I'd love to just I'd love to just take both right oh man
[1282.34 → 1288.34] all right should I do my little topic uh oh no there's still a little bit more for us to say
[1288.34 → 1296.10] about this so reportedly these new GPUs will be built on the TSMC n5 node and the RTX 4090 will
[1296.10 → 1302.74] reportedly feature 18 000 Cuba cores with clocks as high as 2.3 to 2.5 gigahertz that would put it at nearly
[1302.74 → 1313.54] double the RTX 3090's 10 496 cores at 1.7 gigahertz boost it is also rumoured that we could be looking
[1313.54 → 1321.14] at power consumption that is quite literally double or nearly double the current generation cards
[1322.66 → 1330.02] and what this could also mean is that even though we're stepping down to the n5 node these GPUs at
[1330.02 → 1337.14] double the Cuba cores or nearly double the Cuba cores could be so much larger that pricing could be
[1337.14 → 1346.26] proportionally that much higher than what we've seen in the past you couple that with the ongoing silicon
[1346.26 → 1354.26] shortage, and we could be looking at quite possibly the most expensive family of GPUs that the world has
[1354.26 → 1366.82] ever seen our only hope our only possible hope as consumers is if intel's arc series comes out and doesn't suck
[1367.54 → 1372.18] donkey pee yeah that last part's actually really important um
[1374.18 → 1378.50] I don't know what else to say about the intel cards because I feel like we've been waiting for a long time
[1378.50 → 1382.42] I have a fair bit to say about the intel cards I mean they're rumoured to be coming in q1
[1382.42 → 1388.50] they are rumoured to be able to achieve performance up to about a RTX 3070 which would put them
[1388.50 → 1396.50] probably in 40 60 sorts of territory which is fine that's what most people are buying anyway so just
[1396.50 → 1401.54] going to say like yeah it might not be the sexy halo product that some people are waiting to hear for but
[1401.54 → 1408.10] that's the like workhorse card that a lot of people need yeah that'd be sweet I have no, no real issue with
[1408.10 → 1416.26] that yep um, but the problem is that even if intel decides to flood the market with this sort of
[1416.26 → 1422.58] performance tier but not top tier so hopefully affordable GPUs that's still not going to do
[1422.58 → 1429.30] anything about the overall shortage because while we might wish that intel was using their own fabs which
[1429.30 → 1435.86] are which are a separate sort of capacity bucket compared to the rest of the industry which is reliant on
[1435.86 → 1442.98] mostly TSMC and Samsung for the cutting edge nodes I mean TSMC and Samsung that's it um unfortunately
[1442.98 → 1453.30] intel is supposed to be using TSMC for these upcoming GPUs, so there's a silver lining on the one hand
[1453.30 → 1461.22] there's only so many wafers that TSMC can process but on the other hand if intel is focusing this
[1461.22 → 1470.74] production on relatively small dies that can turn a single wafer into relatively more cards yeah then
[1470.74 → 1478.02] more gamers can at least get a card so that if NVIDIA and AMD for that matter want to focus on
[1478.02 → 1483.86] larger die GPUs that are that obviously can be sold for more margin as higher end cards I mean it's no
[1483.86 → 1491.78] coincidence that we haven't seen a desktop 50 series RTX like 30 50 or 30 50 ti I know that ain't
[1491.78 → 1497.62] a coincidence um so if NVIDIA and AMD want to focus on those larger die cards at least people can get
[1497.62 → 1506.82] something and the more people have a GPU at all the more we can hopefully see supply start to
[1506.82 → 1511.86] loosen up a little bit however the global chip shortage is absolutely a real thing sorry conspiracy
[1511.86 → 1519.14] theorists and even apple has apparently been uh slowing iPhone production in spite of their careful
[1519.14 → 1530.66] planning and solid partnerships with chip fabs so um yeah good luck everybody why don't we do a quick
[1530.66 → 1538.74] shout out for our new mic arms here these are from yellow tech they are uh they're mika TV mic arms and
[1538.74 → 1543.54] that's why we've actually got these all in the middle of the table now which is really great for
[1543.54 → 1548.34] keeping them clear of our laptop so we can actually type well Luke's actually isn't in quite the right
[1548.34 → 1553.14] position for him, but these are not the final tables for this set anyway so we'll get that all sorted out
[1553.14 → 1556.90] these are a lot better than the ones that we were using, and they actually stay put I haven't had to
[1556.90 → 1560.74] adjust my mic arm at all during the show which is something that I had to do about every five ten minutes
[1560.74 → 1564.98] on the old ones so they're modular so you can mount any number of different things to them, they look great
[1564.98 → 1569.70] and they have sweet locks on all the joints so that they actually stay in place you can check them out
[1569.70 → 1573.86] along with the rest of our podcast gear in the description uh thank you yellow tech for providing
[1573.86 → 1580.26] these mic arms four months ago took us a little while to get all here the whole time yeah it
[1580.26 → 1585.86] took us a little while to get all the hardware together to get the set up and yeah okay sorry
[1585.86 → 1592.66] guys sorry guys we we eventually definitely did um uh install them
[1594.98 → 1601.14] uh yes we did talk about the swacked oh why you're saying you should get it now we only have
[1601.14 → 1608.58] hundreds now we're going to have thousands oh uh right so I probably should have clarified that yeah nick uh
[1608.58 → 1615.06] dropped here uh they've been hard at work uh figuring out how to get any swag kits here before
[1615.06 → 1622.26] Christmas so the ones that you guys have available now are air shipped ones so we're we're eating it how
[1622.26 → 1631.86] much does it cost us per unit to airship swag kit if it's got to be at least like 10 bucks 18.
[1639.30 → 1643.62] okay, okay so they're only air shipped because they couldn't fit in the container anyway the point is we
[1643.62 → 1648.50] only have a few hundred of these were actually the last ones off the line, and then they didn't fit
[1648.50 → 1652.98] so they airship them so they got here ahead of the ones that are on the sea right now so if you want
[1652.98 → 1658.66] to get one before the end of the year now is the time to order a swag kit, but there will be thousands
[1658.66 → 1664.42] more coming in the new year so thank you nick okay we've got everything we've got perfect clarity on all
[1664.42 → 1671.78] that now this is why I can never be trusted to uh this is why I can never be trusted to pass along
[1671.78 → 1677.14] the creator warehouse stuff those guys they're like basically a completely separate company now not
[1677.14 → 1683.46] basically they're actually on paper a completely separate company speaking of which we've got one
[1683.46 → 1691.38] of I think our coolest update newsletters from the LTT store team this is super cool uh kyle actually
[1691.38 → 1698.82] went through and gave us a bit of a lesson on injection moulding in the was a big problem for
[1698.82 → 1702.18] us newsletter if you guys aren't already subscribed to the newsletter you're going to want to make sure you
[1702.18 → 1707.30] do that because they're going to be trying to put in all kinds of cool little tidbits um we're giving
[1707.30 → 1714.82] some details on why the screwdriver was delayed yet again basically one of the vents for our moulds got
[1714.82 → 1721.54] plugged partway through production of the bit clips and so you can see it's causing some cosmetic issues
[1721.54 → 1729.14] here now some of these parts can actually be reground and then mixed in with new plastic so that they can
[1729.14 → 1736.98] be used for the production of future screwdrivers but some of them can not so we're going to have to
[1736.98 → 1743.06] figure out what to do with some of these assemblies that have been completed but rest assured if you
[1743.06 → 1749.14] guys order a screwdriver you will not be getting one of the one of the mucked up ones but basically
[1749.14 → 1755.54] he goes through, and he gives like a little lesson on how injection moulding works, and it's super, super
[1755.54 → 1760.66] informative if you don't happen to be a manufacturing engineer so make sure that you are make sure you're
[1760.66 → 1767.86] signed up for the newsletter over on lttstore.com oh I wanted to do a hiring search update yeah so we
[1767.86 → 1775.14] have gotten some fascinating applicants I'm not in a position to name names no because that would
[1775.14 → 1783.14] be super awkward if it's someone that we haven't hired but I am expecting an application package from
[1783.14 → 1793.14] someone who is OG tech media like OG written media um someone that I've I've really enjoyed all of
[1793.14 → 1800.02] their work over the years someone who went over to the manufacturing side some time ago and i just
[1800.02 → 1806.02] you know really felt like that was a huge loss for independent tech coverage don't even try to guess
[1806.02 → 1812.10] I won't but i I don't want to get anybody into any kind of any kind of awkward position of course
[1812.10 → 1816.02] not I'm not I'm not going to but I think I might know you yeah someone that i you know I don't get
[1816.02 → 1821.78] to work with nearly as much as I would like but who i I'm hoping to have an opportunity to work with
[1821.78 → 1831.46] all the time uh I've gotten a slightly less OG but also like written media you know personality that has
[1831.46 → 1840.66] applied uh we've gotten one applicant who has worked on some pretty amazing software um for benchmarking
[1840.66 → 1845.78] and this one I definitely know yeah this one you know benchmarking and validation
[1845.78 → 1853.54] um and I just want to reiterate guys so for everyone who hasn't applied yet don't be afraid to
[1854.42 → 1860.66] don't be afraid to apply to don't be afraid to reach out it's not like we's not like we don't understand
[1860.66 → 1865.54] you know what the value of someone with a lot of experience in this industry is it's not like we
[1865.54 → 1870.82] don't understand that manufacturers have a lot of money to throw around, but we also think that
[1870.82 → 1875.86] the mission that we're embarking on here is really important and if you believe it's important
[1875.86 → 1882.02] too then what's the worst that could happen yeah apply and so maybe we don't hire you know maybe
[1882.02 → 1887.06] we can't come to an agreement but at least uh don't be afraid to start a conversation right and if you
[1887.06 → 1893.78] haven't heard from us yet I wouldn't lose hope yet yes there are a lot of applicants there's a lot of
[1893.78 → 1901.06] things going on yeah uh we'll be we'll be trying to get to you as soon as we can but yeah yeah it's

[2086.98 → 2096.50] you go check it out at the link in the video description okay thanks Luke no prob yeah I don't
[2096.50 → 2105.78] think you should be able to change scene collection from uh yeah yeah that is uh oh no way okay
[2105.78 → 2116.90] I broke it again what's this okay uh yeah um okay I'm just not going to be able to change anything from
[2116.90 → 2125.46] now on all right thanks Luke no prob yeah this stream deck definitely needs uh some help Microsoft
[2125.46 → 2132.26] tries to wedge more into edge, so users are crying bloatware as Microsoft has introduced another feature
[2132.26 → 2140.18] into its edge web browser you want to run us through this one it's pretty um not the best actually i have to
[2140.18 → 2149.38] find it first it's 10 out of 10 not the best yeah Microsoft tries to wedge more into edge very cool
[2149.38 → 2155.14] uh you just gotta you know mess with those users that are actually still using your browser that's
[2155.14 → 2162.58] yeah yeah the the few like chromium edition edge you know enthusiasts out there why don't you just
[2162.58 → 2170.10] why don't you just tell them haha f you users are crying uh the two remaining users are crying
[2170.10 → 2175.70] bloatware as Microsoft has introduced another feature into the edge web browser the newest update to edge
[2175.70 → 2184.34] has introduced a payment instalment system provided by zip why this system allows you to pay for items
[2184.34 → 2188.26] through up to four interest-free instalments assuming you pay on time
[2188.26 → 2196.82] oh it has in the notes all 14 edge users have been expressing their concern as services like these
[2196.82 → 2203.46] are often seen as predatory yeah and exploit consumers were spending habits yeah encouraging
[2203.46 → 2211.94] them to spend more money that they don't have wow this is so weird yeah unnecessary there that's
[2211.94 → 2216.74] the word I was looking for the u word it seems like a very odd move for Microsoft to do
[2218.26 → 2226.66] like if anything is is it was their own product I would have been like that's like not cool but
[2226.66 → 2234.02] at least it makes sense i at least understand where it's coming from yes this is just really weird
[2234.66 → 2241.22] super weird users have also accused Microsoft of being money-grubbing yeah for sure that that's
[2241.22 → 2249.94] exactly but Microsoft hit back okay where is that Microsoft said Microsoft is not involved in providing
[2249.94 → 2255.86] the loan and does not collect a fee for connecting users to loan providers cool yeah we understood that
[2255.86 → 2262.66] part um that still leaves a lot of wiggle room for less direct forms of monetization like say for
[2262.66 → 2266.58] example receiving payment for integrating the feature into the browser in the first place which is
[2266.58 → 2273.70] exactly what I expect had happened in the first like what that doesn't mean anything Microsoft come
[2273.70 → 2280.66] on currently there is no clear way to disable this feature actually there is um you just only ever use
[2280.66 → 2288.42] edge to download other browsers yeah um yeah you could pick up Firefox or brave or chrome or I'm still
[2288.42 → 2294.26] a chrome user I'm still using chrome I use chrome for work it's so convenient because the profiles thing is
[2294.26 → 2298.98] so nice i have like four or five different profiles because I use different emails for
[2298.98 → 2304.74] different things and all this kind of stuff and then for non-work I use Firefox these days right yeah
[2304.74 → 2314.74] anyway uh interestingly merchants are automatically opted in to the payment system and have to uh
[2314.74 → 2320.82] specifically opt out for the system to not appear on their website this isn't the first time Microsoft
[2320.82 → 2325.62] has implemented a shopping focus feature into their browser and that's that's not the problem uh in
[2325.62 → 2331.30] November 2020 Microsoft added coupon code and price history display functionality a la honey directly
[2331.30 → 2336.34] into their browser which I heard about and thought was cool which that that one would have been fine yeah
[2337.06 → 2342.74] like that's a pro consumer thing yeah figuring out how to help consumers take on more debt
[2342.74 → 2352.82] is always terrible I mean okay hold on hold on okay some people absolutely do need to finance
[2352.82 → 2361.30] purchases, but you should, I can guarantee that the kinds of things that you're buying with the kinds of
[2361.30 → 2369.70] debt that you're taking on through your web browser are probably not those things yeah probably not most
[2369.70 → 2375.62] people are not buying say food for example through their browser and some people do some people are
[2375.62 → 2382.18] and some people need to and some people need to and that's I'm just saying probably not yeah and
[2382.18 → 2389.38] those people who do need these services can probably find them, and so they probably have reducing friction
[2389.38 → 2395.38] right that's like that's an industry term for helping people spend their money more easily that's what it
[2395.38 → 2402.90] means essentially and that's what this move is this is a friction reduction move not a providing a
[2402.90 → 2409.14] valuable service to people who desperately need it move hopefully this reduces friction for users
[2409.14 → 2413.78] switching off of edge yeah that's that's pretty much the best outcome that we can hope for here
[2413.78 → 2418.90] speaking of friction it's not in the doc but I want to complain about it, I'm actually very adamant
[2418.90 → 2422.42] that I complain about this on the show today okay what do you need to complain about apple
[2422.42 → 2430.74] okay all right yeah okay so we've been focusing on the web front end of the website for quite a
[2430.74 → 2437.94] while now yeah um we decided to divert and focus some efforts on the app sorry for people who recently
[2437.94 → 2441.06] had issues with the android version it's already fixed please check the store if you have still
[2441.06 → 2449.86] any problems um uh, but that included releasing an update for apple we have talked about mobile app
[2449.86 → 2456.34] development for apple on this show a lot because we've had an extremely problematic path the entire
[2456.34 → 2462.90] time it's been very, very rough to deal with them, we talked not even all that recently but somewhat
[2462.90 → 2468.18] recently definitely recent in in regard to the whole timeline of how long wank has been going on for
[2468.18 → 2475.14] we talked about how uh apple is apparently becoming more friendly with app creators because of epic and
[2475.14 → 2480.26] that battle that semi concluded and all that kind of stuff sure so we were like okay we're going to update
[2480.26 → 2484.42] the apps, and we're going to try again with apple because the last thing that we did with apple was
[2484.42 → 2489.70] we cut out almost every single feature we had in the app other than the ability to like play a video
[2489.70 → 2496.50] yeah and just comment out there and there are no comments you weren't able to know what was going on
[2496.50 → 2502.10] when you couldn't view anything in the app because we weren't allowed to tell users what the problem was
[2502.10 → 2509.70] like the most recent update for the iOS app for float plane is terrible it is yeah that's fair
[2509.70 → 2514.90] because there was nothing else we could do apple basically told us that it had to be terrible
[2514.90 → 2520.34] we weren't allowed to make it good it was very frustrating so we just kind of left it there
[2520.34 → 2524.66] because there was nothing we could really do anyway and moved on now we're trying to update it we're
[2524.66 → 2530.10] trying to make it better because theoretically we can do that uh we post an update to the iOS store
[2530.10 → 2537.78] in an attempt to improve it, and it gets rejected and I'm so mad immediately because like we've been
[2537.78 → 2542.90] rejected and if you've watched the show we've been rejected a very large amount of times at one point
[2542.90 → 2548.26] in time we were rejected for more like months literally trying to make it better trying to make
[2548.26 → 2553.62] it is more acceptable every time just to get a response back that they just sort of screwed up I guess
[2553.62 → 2557.94] and it's been fine for like a long time, and then they finally got it through this time
[2557.94 → 2565.22] the problem apparently was that they couldn't log in which is weird because when i originally
[2565.22 → 2571.94] set up the account specifically for them, I set it up I logged out of it and I never touched it again
[2571.94 → 2576.66] and I can pretty much guarantee you no one else on the float plane ever touched it again because why
[2576.66 → 2582.82] would they why would they's been the same this whole time they signed they tried to sign in to the wrong app
[2582.82 → 2591.94] they sent us a picture of the app that they tried to sign in to I have no idea what app that is me
[2591.94 → 2602.02] neither, but it's not ours genius come on so now we have to like reapply to be able to put our update out
[2602.74 → 2607.30] because when we try to push something to the Google store we just upload it, and then it usually takes a
[2607.30 → 2612.58] couple or a few days, and it propagates and then people can download it with apple you have to get
[2612.58 → 2619.70] approved first so it has to go through the approval process again so like apple people out there that
[2619.70 → 2625.46] are using iOS devices I'm sorry I don't know when it's going to be available apparently they can't log in
[2625.46 → 2631.22] to the right freaking app so we'll have to wait until they figure that out I don't even know how they
[2631.22 → 2636.34] manage to find the wrong app like surely they have an internal workflow how is it not automated that
[2636.34 → 2642.42] it like tells we only have one app so it's not like surely they can see what developer they're
[2642.42 → 2650.02] interacting with, and they would just check the like apps that they make yeah so it's not like they
[2650.02 → 2654.66] could have found another one I honestly would have assumed it was like contained environments I would
[2654.66 → 2659.30] have thought it was super automated yeah like whatever credentials we've provided them which
[2659.30 → 2664.26] obviously we have to so they can log into our app I would assume that it would just autofill it
[2664.98 → 2669.30] and that they would just click on which app it is from this developer like how is it not
[2670.66 → 2675.94] what are they on like Zendesk like i just yeah I don't know no offence to Zendesk
[2676.74 → 2681.22] did we use Zendesk at some point Zendesk I believe is being used for creator warehouse do we
[2681.22 → 2685.46] still use it uh I believe it is okay is it all right we use fresh desk they're both fine they're both
[2685.46 → 2690.82] fine okay so yeah not hating on Zendesk or anything I just mean you know they're a trillion
[2690.82 → 2695.14] dollar company I'm sure they probably have their own internal tools for those sorts of things so it
[2695.14 → 2701.94] just surprises me we have literally I'm not joking had more than half of our applications to release
[2701.94 → 2710.10] an app on the iOS store be grievously mishandled than we have been properly handled and that's crazy
[2710.10 → 2718.42] it's insane i just it's so frustrating it's so difficult to release an iOS update just because
[2718.42 → 2726.34] it is so difficult to deal with apple there 's's the rest of it's fine it's ah anyway
[2726.34 → 2732.90] back to normal topics uh what were we going to talk about next I actually had something oh yeah
[2732.90 → 2737.06] someone in flow plane chats said they wanted you to talk about Halo Infinite
[2737.06 → 2742.82] yeah I saw this yeah I don't I don't know why do you want to talk about Halo Infinite I don't oh
[2742.82 → 2748.42] you don't I tried it for the first time today what do you think like post-release really fun right yeah
[2748.42 → 2754.50] yeah yeah it's just like it's just like it feels like fun halo again yeah it's totally fun yeah yeah
[2754.50 → 2758.26] jake made me try it because he's been like you should try Halo Infinite you should try and play
[2758.26 → 2762.42] Halo Infinite I've been like oh I don't have time don't have time and I haven't I haven't had time
[2762.42 → 2767.86] um, but we were shooting a video at my at the new house today oh man oh it's going
[2768.98 → 2775.30] permits are in oh that are not in their back yeah so everything's going like they cut
[2775.30 → 2782.26] a hole in the floor Luke the stairs are framed okay like wow like it's getting real like we
[2782.26 → 2788.10] were there today and from the morning when we started shooting to the end of the day when we left and
[2788.10 → 2793.62] we're done shooting there was like noticeable progress like I'm actually going to eventually
[2793.62 → 2800.98] move into this house that I have now owned for many moons um so I'm really excited but yeah we were
[2800.98 → 2807.94] there shooting a video uh trialling running my gaming rig in the basement and then running an optical cable
[2807.94 → 2814.10] up through the floor to what will be the office where my rig is eventually going to end up, and it worked
[2814.10 → 2820.34] great and the game that Jake wanted me to try out was Halo Infinite so that gave us an opportunity to
[2820.34 → 2826.02] check and make sure that the internet there is running at full tilt turns out she is we were able
[2826.02 → 2831.14] to download it extremely quickly and uh we wanted to check make sure the system was running properly
[2831.14 → 2835.86] it's got a RTX 3090 in it now so that was a little upgrade for me happy birthday to myself
[2835.86 → 2841.94] um it's running great and yeah the game looks great yeah runs super smooth it just feels good right
[2841.94 → 2849.30] yeah that was the main thing for me, i get a lot of pleasure out of that not that kind you're
[2849.30 → 2853.14] able to jump right into the action get a couple of kills as long as you're not stupid and totally
[2853.14 → 2856.98] over committing and getting flanked like it's because I made a pretty big deal about this and I knew people
[2856.98 → 2860.34] were going to laugh me for it and they did this guy I don't want to talk about Halo Infinite won't shut
[2860.34 → 2866.66] up about Halo Infinite go ahead yes please go ahead I didn't know you played it um what do you think of just
[2866.66 → 2871.30] the the the screen that comes up when you launch the game I found it kind of confusing the basic
[2871.30 → 2876.42] minute did you okay yeah I don't understand that part I just don't get you're not the first person
[2876.42 → 2881.22] who said that so like i that's fine yeah I don't know I also don't play a lot of modern shooters so
[2881.22 → 2888.50] maybe I mean there's a multiplayer button right yeah what so I clicked it but then like the settings
[2888.50 → 2893.30] was like a little tiny thing in the bottom right corner okay like that's the first button I'm
[2893.30 → 2898.66] looking for when I launch a game I want to like make sure it didn't totally go her der mode when it was
[2898.66 → 2903.38] trying to figure out what the settings should be because usually they do, and it had v-sync on by
[2903.38 → 2908.58] default who plays a competitive shooter with v-sync on yeah that's weird I mean the game has awful
[2908.58 → 2913.62] tearing oh yeah if you don't have v-sync on so that's a thing and g-sync wasn't working because
[2913.62 → 2920.98] I was over thunderbolt to HDMI long story my normal dock and my normal type c to DP cable weren't there
[2920.98 → 2927.78] um we're gonna we're going to get that fixed for sure but I'm happy you liked it oh okay I think i
[2927.78 → 2933.78] know I never cared about this but I guess they made the like the progression system more friendly
[2933.78 → 2939.70] or something oh progression I'm not playing Halo Infinite for the cosmetics I don't care I couldn't
[2939.70 → 2944.10] give two hoots about that my dude looks vaguely like master chief that's pretty cool yeah I don't
[2944.10 → 2948.58] want him to look like a samurai I mean if I could have like a chef hat I'd be super into that that'd be
[2948.58 → 2953.78] funny master chef that's that's the only thing that i have to do that at some point they have to yeah
[2953.78 → 2960.10] matter of time i just uh people are so mad like if you go on the halo Subreddit and stuff and I'm
[2960.10 → 2964.66] probably going to piss a few of them off right now people are so mad because the progression system is
[2964.66 → 2974.58] like bad or something oh okay I just could not care i the game is fun yeah that's I mean imagine
[2974.58 → 2979.22] I don't know where the buck stops for maybe this is just maybe this is just me being full boomer here
[2979.22 → 2986.02] but i just I can't imagine caring that much about like cosmetics in a game I care about cosmetics
[2986.02 → 2993.38] in some games um for sure and I've talked you were super enjoying how chat I was in um that Markov
[2994.10 → 2997.78] yeah you guys like gave me all the gear and then I just like stupidly put it all on
[2999.14 → 3004.34] you're like wow you look like not a level two or whatever level I was yeah and then i
[3004.34 → 3009.30] immediately proceeded to lose all of it multiple times part of the fun of that multiple times they
[3009.30 → 3014.50] would just deck me out give me like all the best stuff and I'm like standing there like wow and then
[3014.50 → 3024.66] i just immediately get knocked I care about cosmetics sometimes because they can be used as like uh as
[3025.06 → 3030.58] accomplishment rewards sure sense so it can show off that you have done something achieved something
[3030.58 → 3037.30] etc and I know for a fact that content that could be based around that has been cut from games in
[3037.30 → 3043.78] order to take those cosmetics and put it in the store this is a free game this is also arguable
[3043.78 → 3048.58] because the campaign is going to cost money and the campaign now no longer comes with a multiplayer
[3048.58 → 3053.62] because the multiplayer is just free I'm assuming by buying things of the campaign or accomplishing
[3053.62 → 3058.50] well I'm assuming you'll get co-op you're probably going to unlock co-op multiplayer that's coming with
[3058.50 → 3064.02] the campaign though yes so, and it's I think that's coming like way late along with forge so I'm gonna
[3064.02 → 3069.94] have to buy that I guess I can definitely understand why the progression system and cosmetics can annoy
[3069.94 → 3076.42] people sure but personally and i I know this is against the grain whatever it's a multiplayer shooter
[3076.42 → 3082.58] that is fun that honestly has been pretty infrequent yeah let's take it when we can get it yeah
[3082.58 → 3089.62] yeah it's been a while like Markov is really fun, but it also has liked it's a horrifyingly difficult
[3089.62 → 3095.54] it has a horrifying learning curve yeah it's really, really difficult it's hard to just play once or
[3095.54 → 3101.86] twice pick up games with your friends it's its all that kind of stuff so it's cool, but it has problems
[3101.86 → 3108.18] and outside of that like battlefield is rough right now battlefield is very rough cod is trying as hard
[3108.18 → 3113.78] as it possibly can to not be caught any more uh like things are just kind of weird and then halo came
[3113.78 → 3120.02] out, and it was just like a good game so I'm just happy about that yeah but I don't I guess maybe the
[3120.02 → 3125.70] progression system is better i honestly I heard that and never even looked into it because I don't care
[3125.70 → 3129.38] I don't care if it's better I don't care if it's worse I don't care if it doesn't exist i
[3130.42 → 3135.70] doesn't matter to me the game's fun sounds good we should do some merch messages because we've got
[3135.70 → 3141.54] quite a few curated ones here so I'm gonna start at the bottom oh my goodness there's a lot you've
[3141.54 → 3146.82] been curating a lot more than I was I skipped probably like half there's been a lot today
[3147.94 → 3155.54] all right uh Matthew h I do you think the 4000 series cards will have any better of a launch or
[3155.54 → 3159.38] will NVIDIA just give up since people got mad last time anyway there's no way it's going to be any better
[3159.38 → 3167.22] no it's just going to be what it is oh autumn b might have been the first to order the swacked leaked
[3167.22 → 3170.50] been waiting so long to get one good to see finally work things out to get this legendary
[3170.50 → 3175.78] bit of gear back in the store heck yeah I hope you enjoy the new one Zachary asks any updates on
[3175.78 → 3181.62] your experience with the Chevy volt from a fellow 2017 volt owner actually we had a fascinating
[3181.62 → 3187.06] conversation about the Chevy volt Luke and i uh back when one of his acquaintances was looking for a
[3187.06 → 3196.98] new car and honestly my best recommendation for their use which was about 45 kilometres each way
[3196.98 → 3203.14] to and from work commuting pretty much all they were going to do with the car was gone try to find a used
[3203.14 → 3208.26] is it second or third gen whatever the let the lat go try to find a used last gen volt because
[3208.26 → 3214.58] there's almost nothing else like it a full electric car was not in their budget unless we were talking
[3214.58 → 3223.22] like one of those super, super low range ones like the leaf and um the clarity is basically like trying
[3223.22 → 3231.46] to find unobtained at least here in Canada and the Prius prime just doesn't have the range you would
[3231.46 → 3237.94] have to charge at your destination in to have any hope of making it back on battery so you're going to
[3237.94 → 3242.90] end up spending a bunch of money on gas I've been thrilled with it, I mean it's not the know most
[3242.90 → 3249.22] peppy thing in the world but one interesting update yeah that person that went with the prime as you
[3249.22 → 3255.62] know uh-huh one tank of gas so far really mind you I didn't know that they were going to be able to
[3255.62 → 3260.02] charge at the other side yes so they have been charging on the other side they have also been
[3260.02 → 3266.66] um bundling up quite heavily and not turning the heat on uh but which they would have been able to do
[3266.66 → 3277.38] in a volt yeah just saying but one tank of gas so far and uh that was because of like a miscalculation
[3277.38 → 3283.38] probably or something or just i I don't fully even remember, but it like had to go somewhere far and i
[3283.38 → 3287.62] don't even think it was like a full tank I think they're just kind of topping it I mean I really still
[3287.62 → 3294.26] i really still think that plug-in hybrid is a great middle ground depending on your use case it depends on
[3294.26 → 3299.38] your use case there are problems it does add complexity to have two full freaking drive trains
[3299.38 → 3303.62] in a vehicle that's not okay not quite two full drive trains but I think you guys understand what
[3303.62 → 3310.34] I mean two methods of propulsion it adds complexity, but it dramatically reduces the amount of lithium
[3310.34 → 3316.74] and other rare earth metals that are required to produce the vehicle, and it dramatically reduces the
[3316.74 → 3321.70] amount of emissions like yeah if you're the kind of person who buys a plug-in hybrid and then just
[3321.70 → 3326.66] drives it around on gas all the time anyway then okay yeah obviously you're not doing it right
[3326.66 → 3331.14] and there's no benefit to it and I think that's what a lot of the arguments against plug-in hybrid
[3331.14 → 3338.74] have been based on but for my part I burn like six tanks of gas a year they're also, and they're like 30
[3338.74 → 3343.94] litres I think and we've talked about this before but I think a lot of people just don't get it
[3343.94 → 3351.54] I think it's almost a Wii U type of problem you think so sort of because there's a bunch of plug-in
[3351.54 → 3357.30] hybrids that are like I mean they get bundled with those cars that are not even they should
[3357.30 → 3365.46] not be in the same category as the volt uh oh you mean like regular hybrids yeah um no well okay yeah
[3365.46 → 3369.78] the fact that they're even using the word hybrid I think consumer understanding is bundling those
[3369.78 → 3375.38] things together right, and they're just so drastically different uh yeah it's very it's
[3375.38 → 3381.70] very frustrating for me because it really does feel like we missed out on this fantastic middle ground
[3381.70 → 3389.38] I do a between 80 and 90 percent of my driving on battery which is great and obviously in a perfect
[3389.38 → 3396.74] world I wouldn't burn any gas but the reality of it is burning a little bit of gas might not be
[3396.74 → 3402.98] worse than the kinds of things that are being done to get access to more lithium right now like
[3404.34 → 3413.14] it's not a simple cut and dried answer so at some point yeah I'll end up going full EV or I'll end up
[3413.14 → 3418.66] going and who knows hydrogen I don't know whatever the answer ends up being but for now I'm
[3418.66 → 3424.66] extremely happy with the volt and for my use case which is commuting to and from work and pretty much
[3424.66 → 3432.02] doing nothing else with that vehicle it is awesome it's just, just outstanding uh IAN long time listener
[3432.02 → 3436.98] first time caller any chance of a collab with level one or craft computing doing enterprise virtualization
[3436.98 → 3442.50] stuff unpaid's neat but I think it'd be interesting to see something like VMware hyper v or promo
[3442.50 → 3448.82] uh focusing on clustering so for us, you know a big part of what we try to do is make things relatable
[3448.82 → 3455.70] to our viewers many of whom are gamers or uh consumer technology users and so if we had any reason to
[3455.70 → 3461.22] use those technologies we would, we haven't really come across it yet so that's the reason why you
[3461.22 → 3470.58] haven't seen us covering it that much uh hg69 serve any serving I don't know how to pronounce that but
[3470.58 → 3477.30] basically bought one of pretty much everything on the store and said awesome merch screwdriver and backpack
[3477.30 → 3484.26] when screwdriver won't be until next year and backpack won't be until next year I am absolutely
[3484.26 → 3490.02] stoked on this backpack though yeah I came back from my trip, so this is my first trip like really
[3490.02 → 3494.74] daily driving it I'm like okay we need to make some tweaks to the curvature of the foam here we need
[3494.74 → 3499.46] to do this we need to do that hey that change I wanted to make before totally changed my mind scrap
[3499.46 → 3504.82] that we're going to leave it the way it is, but it is going to be flipping awesome did you have more thoughts
[3504.82 → 3511.46] on the like shoulder thing that I was talking about uh what was the shoulder thing again uh
[3511.46 → 3517.22] you need to loosen the straps in order to get it on uh yes I think there's not a ton that we're going
[3517.22 → 3522.50] to be able to do about that that's a pretty normal thing with that yeah so we're going to have it'll be a
[3522.50 → 3529.54] metal clip that should have some pretty good like dig in um so you shouldn't, it shouldn't like loosen too
[3529.54 → 3535.38] much when you're when you are loosening it to get it on um so yeah they're going to be metal but in terms
[3535.38 → 3542.74] of like the elastic on there i I just had durability concerns about it and my bag has wear
[3542.74 → 3549.78] there yeah so like the way that it's built is just like three stitches anywhere there should be one
[3549.78 → 3554.34] yeah and i I don't want to do anything that's going to compromise that that's cool yeah bags get beat
[3554.34 → 3559.54] on so like yeah it's good to have it be and that's you know honestly we had someone internally bring
[3559.54 → 3567.30] up um some concerns about the the high carbon nature of some of the businesses that we're
[3567.30 → 3574.26] expanding into like merch so flying these products all around the world, and you know basically what i
[3574.26 → 3580.66] what I said to them is look um you know there's nothing we can really do about the the the reality of
[3581.30 → 3586.90] transporting goods around the planet but what we can do is we can try to make things that last
[3587.78 → 3593.30] we could try to make things that are designed so that you won't have to buy the next one that's big
[3593.30 → 3595.38] for me too and that's actually one of the reasons why
[3598.42 → 3603.86] legitimately like outside the necessities of the job that I have I've supported and been behind
[3603.86 → 3608.98] Ltd store the whole time is because I think you and i both have a problem with I don't even know what
[3608.98 → 3614.18] it's called right now um fast fashion yeah fast fashion is like terrible I hate which is why
[3614.18 → 3619.78] nothing we do is particularly fashionable yeah big because we don't pay attention to trends at all i
[3619.78 → 3626.90] don't care, and it will always look good it'll always look like what it is yeah which is Ltd store
[3626.90 → 3630.74] and like this is one of the examples like this sorry for moving away from the mic the swag is one of
[3630.74 → 3635.22] the examples of like I can't think of a single point in time in my life where I thought this wouldn't
[3635.22 → 3641.54] have been at least pretty cool yeah it's its fine yeah it's not it's not exactly on trend for this
[3642.58 → 3648.74] season of this year nope but like who cares I have never been on trend for any season of any year
[3650.26 → 3655.70] the stack it was already kind of a weird out there thing when we first launched it like four or five
[3655.70 → 3662.82] years ago or whenever it came out and this is just pretty much that, but we fixed some of the QA issues
[3662.82 → 3670.26] so it's certainly not any trendier today yeah so if you like it that's cool, and hopefully it'll last
[3670.26 → 3675.46] a long time I don't have anything from Ltd store and I have some old school stuff that's like trashed
[3676.02 → 3682.18] oh for sure it's all still good yeah which i that makes me believe in it a lot personally Samuel says
[3682.18 → 3687.78] hey any etc timeline on the build your own pc for kids our son is four months old it would be awesome if
[3687.78 → 3693.38] it comes out in time for him to have it at the prime age it's meant for um there is no eta on
[3693.38 → 3698.82] that project uh not only are we having some well actually we've solved most of the difficulties with
[3698.82 → 3704.42] the magnets so we were really concerned about embedding magnets in wood because if a kid eats
[3704.42 → 3711.54] a magnet oh boy and glue loses I forget it's like something like 20 of its strength every year for
[3711.54 → 3717.70] um until basically it fails and so eventually those magnets were going to get pulled out and some
[3717.70 → 3723.06] kid was going to eat it so I pretty much told the team I was like look if we can't screw the magnets into
[3723.06 → 3730.98] the wood we're not making this so we had to figure out a way to screw magnets into wood which has been
[3730.98 → 3738.18] challenging I think we're there uh I'm pretty excited, but that project has been sort of sidelined by
[3738.18 → 3744.42] something also magnet related that is a little bit more mainstream um so instead of being something
[3744.42 → 3749.78] that could be like a six figure project it's been sidelined that engineer has been moved on to
[3749.78 → 3753.94] something that's probably a seven figure project for us that I'm going to be really excited to tell
[3753.94 → 3759.38] you guys about when we're a little bit closer but I think Nick would murder me if I told you anything
[3759.38 → 3766.34] about it today yeah because we're just not that close we're doing a ton of work it's been it's been
[3766.34 → 3771.46] fascinating um getting the perspective of our engineers who are like I was talking to one
[3771.46 → 3776.18] of them he's like yeah I'm not like the world's best engineer or anything like that but I have to
[3776.18 → 3781.54] say that you know I'm a good engineer and because i was telling him I was like wow this is amazing
[3781.54 → 3786.74] that you've like done this you know um, and it was a bunch of work he'd done on like magnetic pull strength
[3787.30 → 3792.50] and he was like yeah well it's because I'm like a competent person who was actually given a
[3792.50 → 3797.70] reasonable amount of time to work on something and I was like oh well yeah keep doing what you're
[3797.70 → 3802.82] doing than like yeah i it just it kind of blew me away that these people who are coming in with
[3802.82 → 3807.86] experience from outside Linus media group are like yeah I just have never really I've never really
[3807.86 → 3813.62] had time to do my best work I'm like oh well that sucks that's stupid we see that in the software
[3813.62 → 3821.14] slash game development industry all the time right that blows man yeah um all right oh this is
[3821.14 → 3827.54] interesting john z asks you've done how does LTT make money I would be really interested in how LTT
[3827.54 → 3832.18] spends money in the same format with all the additional things like creator warehouse and now
[3832.18 → 3841.38] LTT labs it would be fascinating to see that breakdown oh man how do i how do I do that without
[3841.94 → 3850.18] saying too much um I'm not sure because to me how we make money is something that I'll reveal
[3850.18 → 3856.18] far more freely because you know I see ICS as having kind of a responsibility to the rest of the
[3856.18 → 3863.94] creator community to disclose you know what these sources of revenue are and um put it out there so
[3863.94 → 3871.06] that others can use it as a benchmark like hey okay hold on a second Linus and his team are doing you know
[3871.06 → 3878.10] 25 of their revenue through merch mine's at two percent have I missed something here have I missed the boat
[3878.10 → 3882.98] you should create, and so they can so they can course correct right whereas how we spend money
[3882.98 → 3890.42] is sort of like a step farther ahead it's like it's what we haven't done yet whereas how we're making
[3890.42 → 3895.62] money is showing what we've done, so there's the risk that I'm going to say something and I could end up
[3895.62 → 3901.14] actually misleading someone maybe they see how we're investing, and they go oh I need to invest like
[3901.14 → 3907.70] that, and it ends up not being a success for us and then not a success for them, i um
[3910.26 → 3916.90] yeah I don't I don't know how I feel about that one nothing's impossible but right now that is not on
[3916.90 → 3924.58] my radar uh victor any updates on making past and future newsletters available as a blog or something
[3924.58 → 3936.10] similar uh hopefully nick will do that at some point um do do do uh nick people asking for news
[3936.90 → 3944.10] letter archive in blog form okay yeah I'll, I'll see what I can do about that
[3946.58 → 3952.34] what else we got here cool hey I've heard you make a couple of Taylor Swift references in the past
[3952.34 → 3956.98] month I'm dying to know if you're a swift and if so what's your favourite album so I've talked about
[3956.98 → 3964.82] this before I'm not really a fan of anyone um i I just don't really i I don't really what what's the
[3964.82 → 3971.06] thing about never meet your heroes or whatever it is like i just people are human they're they're
[3971.06 → 3978.98] full of you know warts and flaws and mistakes and I'm no different and i just uh I don't believe in
[3978.98 → 3986.42] the word fan has such a has such a terrible connotation for me, it's short for fanatic right like it's not
[3987.06 → 3995.94] it's not rational it's not reasoned it's just um it's rabid you know it's its crazed it's not
[3997.38 → 4004.98] i I don't think people should be fans of people, and they especially shouldn't be fans of organizations
[4004.98 → 4012.26] organizations that want to make money off of them yeah you can respect someone you can enjoy you can
[4012.26 → 4020.10] appreciate their work but no I wouldn't say that I'm a swift and I would not join a fandom of any
[4020.10 → 4025.54] sort like that I absolutely respect everything that she had why I shouldn't say I respect everything
[4025.54 → 4034.26] she's done I respect the uh career that she has built for herself um I enjoy her music um what
[4034.26 → 4038.98] else can I what else can I really say what else needs to be said I mean is that not enough you know
[4042.18 → 4046.82] I don't have a favourite album I've never bought an album I've never I've never gone that far
[4046.82 → 4051.38] like streaming baby yeah streaming is kind of a thing yeah streaming is pretty cool like who
[4051.38 → 4057.70] buys an album like i I'll listen to I'll listen to all her new music but I absolutely don't need
[4057.70 → 4062.74] to own it the day that she releases an album I'll wait for whenever it shows up on my streaming service
[4062.74 → 4067.70] I'm not going to switch streaming services like there was at some point i was on Google play music
[4067.70 → 4072.74] and like her most recent couple of albums were not on it, I was like okay I guess I'm not listening to
[4072.74 → 4078.02] those then like it's just very straightforward for me, I'll listen to it, I'll enjoy it but I'm no i
[4078.02 → 4084.42] don't I don't need to listen to anything I can kind of enjoy pretty much any kind of music um one
[4084.42 → 4090.90] exception i immediately you know was on to the new alba uh abba album which I did quite enjoy but
[4090.90 → 4094.82] then I like forgot about it and I just listened to whatever again so I don't know there's a decent
[4094.82 → 4100.26] amount of stuff these days that I like to listen to that's that's pretty much only in YouTube video
[4100.26 → 4105.94] form so YouTube music is big for me because then I can at least listen to it in the background yeah
[4105.94 → 4112.98] that's fair yeah uh main finicky uh will the channel review more e-scooters and such uh maybe
[4112.98 → 4117.62] on short circuit but I wouldn't expect a ton of it on LTT uh kyle asks are there any companies that a
[4117.62 → 4126.18] merger with arm would lead to innovation in the whole industry um wow not that I can really think of
[4126.82 → 4131.38] I mean that's the whole thing with companies right like they exist for one purpose to make money right so
[4131.38 → 4141.30] um you know taking arms approach which is obviously to make money through licensing as IP and tying that
[4142.10 → 4149.78] to anyone else who presumably anyone who would buy arm for what it's worth right like they would have to
[4149.78 → 4156.10] be a beneficiary of that IP would create a clear conflict of interest so no, no I really can't think of
[4156.10 → 4165.22] anyone who should own arm at least within the it industry um whoops I might have just accidentally
[4165.22 → 4171.22] nuked the wrong uh merch message I had my sincere apologies if I missed yours pierce watch last week's
[4171.22 → 4176.58] when my wife has a long torso she's super excited you're planning on a long line women's cut shirt yes
[4176.58 → 4185.86] we are um she says llama fit and alpaca fit for women's sizes that's why I created that one I don't
[4185.86 → 4191.46] know but I thought you might be interested is it like uh is it like a pc way of saying like you know
[4191.46 → 4198.34] pear-shaped or whatever I'm not like I have never made a comparison between these two animals that
[4198.34 → 4204.66] specifically yeah but I leave I believe llamas have longer skinnier necks so would that be like a tall
[4204.66 → 4211.46] and alpacas are like fluffier I don't know I'm not sure I give up I'd have to look I think we're
[4211.46 → 4218.90] just we're probably just going to go for non-pc lanky girl thick girl like i I think we're just gonna
[4218.90 → 4226.82] i whatever we use for guys I just want to use for girls as well, and we'll just be like nope those are
[4226.82 → 4232.26] just the words that we use we ain't saying it's bad we ain't saying it's good you cannot like those words
[4232.26 → 4239.62] and that's fine cool you don't have to buy it nice
[4241.94 → 4247.78] battlefield said that battlefield went like this yeah well hopefully we don't
[4249.22 → 4253.78] hopefully we don't suffer the same fate oh man
[4253.78 → 4264.10] um okay hey cool uh what else we got we just got a few more we got a few more to get through here
[4265.30 → 4270.50] watch the wan show last week says oh man that's pierce Ryan hey guys been watching since the Langley
[4270.50 → 4275.30] house era now close to graduating from college hey awesome just accepted a job last week with a particular
[4275.30 → 4281.46] GPU designer wanted to share my gratitude hey thanks Ryan g appreciate you Maximilian I'm looking to build a
[4281.46 → 4286.42] NAS with a lot of storage and PCI e lanes for Plex slash others do you have any affordable CPU
[4286.42 → 4290.98] recommendations that would work and have Windows 11 support well you're probably going to want to go
[4290.98 → 4301.22] with like uh oh man dozen 2000 does if I recall correctly dozen 2000 uh TPM 2.0 hold on let's check
[4301.22 → 4306.74] that blah blah blah yeah yeah if you pick up like a multicore dozen 2000 or something like that
[4306.74 → 4312.02] would be pretty sweet or like a 2000 series thread ripper I'm not sure what eBay prices are like on
[4312.02 → 4318.10] those but if you need a lot of PCI e lanes uh old um decommissioned thread ripper systems are a good
[4318.10 → 4324.10] way to go about that that's what I did for the badminton streaming system at the badminton court
[4324.10 → 4328.74] that I equipped with all those cameras and stuff I went for like an I was going to be using Windows 10 so
[4328.74 → 4335.14] I didn't care so I went with a 1000 series thread ripper 16 core it's freaking awesome got all them PCI e lanes like
[4335.14 → 4341.14] there's nothing really comparable to it for the price yeah uh what else we got here
[4344.18 → 4348.98] I need the shoe fan slash battery pack currently using a ski boot dryer for my work boots and it
[4348.98 → 4355.94] doesn't even work that well oh dalton it's been delayed it's been delayed i honestly this is
[4355.94 → 4362.26] not just an excuse silicon shortage oh really yeah we can't, we can't even get just like
[4362.26 → 4368.74] like randomly even digit key like the prices are up 5 10x what they were if we can get certain stuff
[4368.74 → 4374.50] and when you're trying to prototype things you know you break there's some breakage you break one
[4374.50 → 4380.42] thing you're like okay well this is stalled until I wait 32 days for a new thing to come like it just
[4380.42 → 4387.22] it's making everything take so much longer that's brutal we will make it eventually, but it's just it's been
[4387.22 → 4391.54] very, very difficult uh would you ever consider making a Ltd blanket or pin set okay those are
[4391.54 → 4397.38] both very different things we are working on pins, but they'll be like free items um as for a Ltd blanket
[4397.38 → 4402.90] believe it or not yes we are working on it because we have a ton of alpaca wool and i kind of want to
[4402.90 → 4411.38] do just like a really nice duvet and then just a techie but not in cell duvet cover you know what I mean
[4411.38 → 4420.10] like yeah like you'd need the partner to be okay with it the the the partner approval factor the path
[4420.10 → 4428.42] yeah needs to be path pretty strong needs to be high yeah yeah yeah uh anonymous how viable would it
[4428.42 → 4435.38] be to estimate to how viable would you estimate the Ltd backpack for a mobile twin monitor setup
[4436.02 → 4440.66] I use a g chic monitor would it be possible for float plane to have a platform-wide playlist for all
[4440.66 → 4444.42] content uploaded chronologically okay there's no way they're going to develop that feature sorry
[4444.98 → 4450.10] it's just the home page no, but it would be reverse currently so they would want to just autoplay
[4451.06 → 4454.34] the like next video from that uploader actually I guess that would be pretty possible
[4454.34 → 4459.78] platform-wide playlist for all up content uploaded chronological yeah if you just that's the home page
[4459.78 → 4467.30] yeah, but it won't autoplay the next thing oh it can, could we autoplay the next video uh we have I
[4467.30 → 4471.38] should we do that I'm staying away from those types of features because we have a player that's like
[4471.38 → 4476.82] genuinely really close that's coming out that is like the theatre player, and it has a bunch of
[4476.82 → 4482.90] other it's its just like way cooler and way nicer once those once that is out got it willing to
[4482.90 → 4487.54] entertain those types of things yeah as for the dual monitor thing it's a pretty big backpack but I don't
[4487.54 → 4492.66] know if I would guarantee depending on like what system is powering your dual monitor setup
[4492.66 → 4498.02] uh a g-chic monitor isn't that one of those us bones yeah they're pretty small I mean i I would
[4498.02 → 4502.98] think it would work, but it really depends on the diagonal size um I guess we can't like guarantee it
[4502.98 → 4508.90] but yeah I'd wager it would work yeah tail we cannot bring back lutes Luke's birds uh they were really
[4508.90 → 4513.94] bothering some people who have like ear conditions that make them really sensitive to those noises so
[4513.94 → 4519.30] it's not happening it's a good suggestion doing a build with a YouTube singer I don't know
[4519.30 → 4526.26] what like a singer specific build would look like blue wolf oh this one i I curated because there's
[4526.26 → 4535.38] this okay I have never been a notable fan of just free stylists because I find it always comes off a
[4535.38 → 4541.30] little rough and I'd rather listen to like something that's planned yeah there's this dude on YouTube
[4541.30 → 4549.14] called harry mac he's incredibly good and I think it could actually be like really entertaining to have
[4549.14 → 4552.74] you build the computer for him, and he freestyles the build
[4555.54 → 4560.90] huh I think it could genuinely be really cool it also might just end up being one of those things
[4560.90 → 4570.18] that is more cringe than not like the ASMR uh build that people the people who liked it they liked it but
[4570.18 → 4578.34] it was the worst performing video that we uploaded this year I think oh whoa other than just fully sponsored
[4578.34 → 4583.38] like some product no one cares about and people didn't want to watch like and something like that
[4583.38 → 4590.26] yeah it was real it yeah it's got 820 000 views man I've never heard anyone freestyle at a
[4590.26 → 4597.62] level that I would say is 75 of what he can do and let me tell you let me tell you this is one
[4597.62 → 4605.54] video where I'm grateful the dislike button's gone to be clear I'm not more transparency is absolutely what i
[4605.54 → 4611.62] believe in that was a joke just for those of you who are not 100 picking up on the verbal irony there
[4611.62 → 4617.86] speaking of which I have not vetted this yeah so look into it first, but there's and there's an
[4617.86 → 4623.14] extension you can download for chrome yeah it won't work once they pull the API yeah yeah it works now
[4623.14 → 4628.02] though, and it's its grabbing historical stuff so you can yeah they're pulling API access in like two
[4628.02 → 4632.66] weeks it's a very temporary solution no i for instructional things like if you're trying to do
[4632.66 → 4637.78] uh handiwork at home sure you might watch a video that's from six years ago I'd have to it'll still
[4637.78 → 4642.58] have the info from then oh it will, it's grabbing historical data right now oh that's pretty smart
[4642.58 → 4647.46] yeah they're going to be limited to how many API calls they can do though I think they are, and they're like
[4647.46 → 4651.30] trying to work around it and stuff I was reading about it, I haven't vetted it but I was reading about
[4651.30 → 4657.30] it this whole thing is so stupid it is it's extremely it's its already made viewing things on YouTube
[4657.30 → 4661.62] more difficult for me for me to the point where I have just closed YouTube out of frustration and
[4661.62 → 4669.70] try to find another way yeah which I'm hoping will reflect in some form of watch time registration i
[4669.70 → 4676.18] don't like it will, I don't think so, so much of watch time is just like cute cat videos or whatever I mean
[4676.18 → 4682.98] even those can be really frustrating like you'll see like uh cheetah takes down a gazelle or whatever
[4682.98 → 4690.02] and it's this four-minute video and like the cheetah doesn't you know like it's just yeah, or it's just
[4690.02 → 4696.58] like a bunch of someone else's footage that was just cut together and has nothing to do with like it's
[4696.58 → 4704.50] oh man its oh yeah I don't know what to tell you guys other than to write your congressman
[4704.50 → 4714.90] no that won't help YouTube doesn't listen to them um yeah Benjamin borrowing a neighbour's VR gear for
[4714.90 → 4719.38] a month love it any recommended games other than Alex and beat safer I mean I spend almost all of my
[4719.38 → 4727.30] VR time in beat safer i I used to really enjoy uh hollow point be ready to sweat though hollow point's
[4727.30 → 4731.46] amazing yeah I was actually going to specifically say hollow point check out the lab I mean it's old
[4731.46 → 4736.26] it's an oldie but a goodie the archery game in it is really outstanding uh space pirate trainer is a
[4736.26 → 4743.06] classic I played through um trover saves the universe in VR it was fine um I haven't I just
[4743.06 → 4748.26] haven't tried that many VR experiences other than beat safer I'm just I just love beat safer so much
[4748.26 → 4753.86] uh horseshoes and hand grenades or sorry hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades yeah yeah I haven't tried
[4753.86 → 4759.30] that one hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades excuse me
[4759.30 → 4768.66] all right let's go ahead and hit our next merch message here hey I'm applying in q1-ish next year
[4768.66 → 4772.98] got some contracts and stuff till then was wondering if I could possibly do correspondence work on crypto
[4772.98 → 4778.18] news until then any interest tax skill wise I'm pretty set on par with most of the boys currently
[4778.18 → 4784.34] very deep in crypto though I can tell you now that um crypto is going to be a bit of a sensitive
[4784.98 → 4791.70] area for the gaming audience which is really our bread and butter so while we do report on crypto
[4791.70 → 4796.66] stuff from time to time I mean we did a full series about it a couple of years ago it's the sort of
[4796.66 → 4804.18] thing where there's a lot of friction there, and it's a funny thing because you know I believe that a lot of
[4804.18 → 4810.98] gamers are mining crypto on their GPUs when they're not gaming um personally I don't have a huge problem
[4810.98 → 4815.46] with that particularly during the colder months when quite frankly you could either be heating your
[4815.46 → 4820.34] house with some other a lot of the time like electric baseboards, or you could be heating your
[4820.34 → 4824.90] house by mining crypto and making some money off of it not all areas are the same too as some
[4824.90 → 4832.34] places are yes especially in Canada are very heavily powered by renewable energy yes so like yeah why not
[4832.34 → 4836.90] so I think there are ways that crypto can be used the way it was intended
[4836.90 → 4843.22] um but I also see why there's a lot of friction between the community of people that are not using
[4843.22 → 4850.34] it I think as the creators envisioned and the people who just want access to hardware and to
[4850.34 → 4859.14] power that is you know cheaper, and you know well affordable right so yeah I can't say that that's
[4859.14 → 4864.66] something that we're likely to focus on but I do think that it's something that there is the potential
[4864.66 → 4870.42] for us to cover because it is an area of tech that like it or not is becoming larger and more important
[4872.50 → 4878.42] um nd1 club yo this merch is sick it's perfect for the PNW climate oh pacific northwest
[4878.42 → 4881.46] climate okay that might have been one that didn't need to be curated to push that one
[4882.18 → 4887.70] right when I read it I was like oh oops uh Alex 73 6 30 thanks for all the work you've been doing
[4887.70 → 4892.18] been a sub for years and a float plane OG member hey heck yeah still enjoy the content can't wait to see
[4892.18 → 4897.22] all the surprises you all preparing for the next year and beyond hey thanks Joshua LTT got me into
[4897.22 → 4901.22] computers and tech when I was 10 eight years later I'm going to pursue computer science in college
[4902.02 → 4908.82] love to hear it enjoy your gift card Ashley uh thanks and thanks to Anthony for recommending pop OS
[4908.82 → 4918.42] wife and I love it bills also any plans to make bras Ashley i have to say as someone who is not a breast
[4918.42 → 4927.14] expert um i just I'm not not not a you know no I'm not a know FBI member remember those
[4927.14 → 4933.30] horrible shirts those were they were cringe they were trash yeah as not an as not a breast
[4933.30 → 4945.62] expert um I would feel like I don't have a lot to contribute to um the bra space like when it comes okay
[4945.62 → 4950.02] so we've got a garment coming that I think is going to be really cool it's called the workshop jacket
[4950.02 → 4958.82] and basic or workshop coat I don't remember, but it's like it's designed for like an engineer or a
[4958.82 → 4965.54] maker so its like got lots of pockets, but it's made out of like this super, super robust material
[4965.54 → 4970.74] that would be very unlikely to ever get snagged or get caught in anything, and its like got like a leather
[4970.74 → 4977.38] patch LTT logo on it's like super cool um I had nothing to do with it, I basically didn't touch it
[4977.38 → 4983.14] other than to be a size model for the medium size and there's a reason for that that's because folks
[4983.14 → 4991.30] like Colin and Tynan and kyle and Alex who are actual engineers and actual makers were the ones who
[4991.30 → 4996.98] spec'd it because they were the ones who looked at the other options that they've had experience using
[4996.98 → 5001.94] or that they see out on the market and went yeah, but it doesn't fit my needs in this this this and
[5001.94 → 5009.14] this way that's why we made that garment because we found something that didn't address our needs
[5009.14 → 5012.66] and felt we could do it better with a bra
[5016.18 → 5022.74] pockets what yeah I mean there are bras with pockets I don't know yeah I mean i also not an expert
[5022.74 → 5028.66] I have nothing I can add in this realm i yeah I don't know so it's one of those things where you
[5028.66 → 5035.86] know if I had you know breasts and I really felt like wow what if they what is they didn't need to
[5035.86 → 5041.06] separate what if they were what if all they did was support and lift you know or whatever right i I don't
[5041.06 → 5047.54] know i yeah i just have nothing I just have nothing to contribute uh or at least I feel like I have
[5047.54 → 5053.30] nothing I mean okay quick release bra there that's my those already exist oh probably
[5054.18 → 5061.46] I don't know, and they have all kinds of different bras Ashley i I wish you luck finding a bra it's such
[5061.46 → 5066.50] a's such a specialized garment I just don't see us getting into it, I know that I know that the ladies
[5066.50 → 5072.90] in creator warehouse are definitely hard at work on underwear and ladies fitted garments but bras I think
[5072.90 → 5080.10] are just not in the cards anytime soon oh okay that was very long-winded no
[5083.70 → 5089.94] uh what else we got here part-time remote data scientists probably not a lot of work
[5089.94 → 5096.18] that needs to be done yeah more than part-time uh Michael I am supposed to be working on the numbers
[5096.18 → 5101.70] book counting computers obviously there's going to be a what's a computer reference in there I'm supposed
[5101.70 → 5110.02] to be doing that Sarah keeps writing me about it like yeah I know Nick keeps writing me about it, i
[5110.02 → 5115.14] will do it at some point and then I definitely want to do colours and shapes and all that kind of stuff i
[5115.14 → 5121.30] just I haven't gotten around to it, I'm sorry I've just been really busy anonymous says hey thanks for
[5121.30 → 5125.22] the content I know scrapyard wars is out of the question but do you have plans for in-house large-scale
[5125.22 → 5130.34] competition style videos with leg staff or guests yeah I'd love to revisit the cardboard case challenge
[5130.34 → 5135.62] uh we're always down to do challenge type videos the problem though is that a lot of the time we
[5135.62 → 5139.78] they're a lot they're a ton of work they tie up a ton of people's time, and they don't necessarily
[5139.78 → 5146.42] outperform us just vlogging individually so it's its tough to justify anonymous would love to see a
[5146.42 → 5150.34] shirt length in the sizing guide my arm length often doesn't play well with clothes that match my
[5150.34 → 5154.66] shoulder and chest width um we're going to be working on making more detailed sizing guides as
[5154.66 → 5160.74] we go forward especially as we bring out the thick and lanky sizing uh or like size options so
[5161.30 → 5168.90] you guys will have to just um you'll have to bear with us here uh Michael h yes more colours of shirts
[5168.90 → 5175.46] are coming they are coming we actually have coloured shirts upstairs now should I bring them down why
[5175.46 → 5179.14] you do a few more while I bring them down I'm going to bring them down everything someone mentioned a bra
[5179.14 → 5188.18] that could work as a controller and I thought that was funny I mean you could do it with a makey
[5188.90 → 5196.34] yeah you could uh anonymous said thank you for the stack it is looks very useful and I was looking for
[5196.34 → 5201.46] a new jacket anyway for a video series question have you considered doing this is going to be probably
[5201.46 → 5206.10] difficult for me to answer have you considered doing tutorial style videos for how to use things
[5206.10 → 5213.14] on Windows slash mac for different topics uh there's a thing that we did way back in the day i
[5213.14 → 5218.02] didn't do that many episodes of it because there honestly wasn't that many things to cover um but we
[5218.02 → 5223.22] it was called Luke software disco discoveries I believe uh I don't know if we called all of them
[5223.22 → 5227.86] that uh, but we did it we've done a video on nine night we've done a video on uh the thing that I can't
[5227.86 → 5233.46] remember right now that makes you can use your mouse on multiple computers um we've done some of
[5233.46 → 5240.10] that content in the past software stuff is pretty specific um it's going to have to be like really
[5240.10 → 5244.82] interesting and no one's gonna care if we make a video on how to use word so you have to
[5244.82 → 5250.90] like consider all of those things at the same time so it is really depends um I wouldn't I I would
[5250.90 → 5254.34] definitely say it's not out of the picture uh but I don't think it's like a main thing that they're
[5254.34 → 5260.90] driving for we are covering Linux um we have some videos on the channel right now on how to use
[5260.90 → 5265.30] Linux how to set up for different things and obviously lions and I are I mean we've been done
[5265.30 → 5269.22] for a while now but the videos are coming out for the Linux challenge that Linus and I did so
[5270.02 → 5272.58] ah yeah someone in full plane chat said the most things called synergy
[5273.62 → 5279.78] um Isaac s said hi Luke and Linus love the show you talk a lot of smack about website tech media
[5279.78 → 5285.78] especially I don't think we do that much uh especially when it comes to the Linux stuff okay
[5285.78 → 5290.98] sure uh with how fast leg is growing why don't you put your money where your mouth is I don't think
[5290.98 → 5298.74] making a text-based website for Linux stuff is in our future necessarily those are some pretty cool colours
[5298.74 → 5311.86] are they on camera yet no there we go I like this, so these are our own label uh shirts so you can see
[5311.86 → 5317.94] we do have black uh we are attempting to reduce our reliance on American Apparel with their terrible
[5317.94 → 5322.98] terrible supply chain management um that's the reason that we've only been able to have black so
[5322.98 → 5327.38] these are not the only colours that we're planning in the future, but this is our first order we've got
[5327.38 → 5331.62] like I think it's only a couple of thousand of each colour so we're coming up with some cool designs for
[5331.62 → 5341.46] them and this is something I learned recently um again uh an innovation from the ladies in the creator
[5341.46 → 5352.10] warehouse uh team scrunchies' oh so I learned that hair scrunchies like this are usually or not usually
[5352.10 → 5358.10] okay I don't know if usually but are often made of the scraps that would have otherwise just
[5358.10 → 5363.54] been thrown away from t-shirt production that makes sense, so our scrunchies are going to perfectly match
[5363.54 → 5369.94] our t-shirts which maybe is not as relevant right now while we only have unisex cuts but once we have
[5369.94 → 5374.74] fitted shirts and stuff like that you could totally have like a scrunchie that totally matches your shirt
[5374.74 → 5381.94] which is totally cool sweet uh yeah, so these are cool, so this is sort of um sample
[5381.94 → 5385.86] sample packaging of what this might look like but LTT logo, and then we've got a little thing
[5385.86 → 5390.18] these scrunchies are made from repurposed waste fabric from our t-shirts so it's pretty neat right
[5390.18 → 5391.86] sweet nice yeah
[5394.02 → 5402.42] um i Kyra p thanks for the awesome stuff guys Luke uh what would you say apple could improve the most
[5402.42 → 5408.02] about their development process would it be a policy change in what's allowed uh or a change to the
[5408.02 → 5416.18] submittal process uh it's yeah uh PS miss you on more I think there's supposed to be more of that
[5416.18 → 5421.22] message but I appreciate it um there are a few things that kind of drive me nuts here one is you have to
[5421.22 → 5429.14] pay I believe it's yearly to be allowed to put things on the apple platform which is like cool in some ways
[5429.14 → 5434.82] yeah because it keeps the Apple Store clean yeah, but it's also annoying in other ways I have to pay
[5434.82 → 5442.58] pay for a horrible experience that is the problem that sucks if the validation of apps happened
[5442.58 → 5451.78] significantly faster and if they were significantly better at it, we have had so many false negatives
[5451.78 → 5458.18] it's extremely, extremely difficult to deal with the fact that that costs a very not insignificant
[5458.18 → 5465.46] amount of money this terrible service costs a not insignificant amount of money is just despicable
[5465.46 → 5472.74] and it needs to die uh we're not doing any more merch messages other than what's been sent already so
[5472.74 → 5477.06] don't bother sending more I don't know about chemical engineer applicants for creator warehouse
[5477.06 → 5482.74] you'd have to reach out to them about it um but I should mention guys half of the wickets are gone
[5483.30 → 5487.78] for the air shipment you'll still get a chance to get more once the sea shipment arrives later
[5487.78 → 5492.42] but half of the air shipment is gone so if you wanted to get one right away then make sure that
[5492.42 → 5500.50] you get it right away will there be a winter coat for Canadian northerners okay um we do have
[5501.14 → 5507.94] a soft shell coming we have a rain shell coming but I don't think we have anything like really hardcore
[5507.94 → 5514.66] in the pipeline right now we want to try these um this sort of slightly simpler technical garments
[5514.66 → 5520.50] first make sure we get the water resistance right make sure we get the fit right um and then we
[5520.50 → 5527.06] can we can tackle stuff like that in the future I mean that team is growing so fast right now um so
[5527.06 → 5535.06] it's its very expensive to run also every new project costs sick deep into six figures to develop
[5535.06 → 5540.34] and then place an initial order for before you ever get any kind of return on it, so there's just a limit to
[5540.34 → 5548.82] how many garments that we can have in the pipeline at a time uh Samuel long time viewer first ever
[5548.82 → 5554.66] YouTuber merch would you ever switch leg to using Linux with Windows servers to remote into to edit
[5554.66 → 5559.54] and to perform other windows necessities that's honestly one of the things that Luke and I talked
[5559.54 → 5566.74] about a lot during the Linux challenge is if you need like if you're using Linux to what browse the web
[5566.74 → 5578.82] like browse files and then to do things you need to do you need windows then why yeah it like I'm not
[5578.82 → 5584.18] gonna I'm not gonna it sounds like using windows with extra steps if you kind of catch my
[5584.18 → 5590.42] catch my drift so no I don't think I would ever have my editors like run Linux on their machine just
[5590.42 → 5594.90] so that they can remote into a Windows machine with all of window's quirks anyway because then you're just
[5594.90 → 5599.38] you're piling quirks and bugs on top of quirks and bugs because neither of them is perfect
[5599.94 → 5604.58] why are you doing that you might as well just have one set of quirks and bugs if that makes sense
[5604.58 → 5609.14] but yeah you're going to have some work out yeah feel the same way yeah I just don't think that's
[5609.14 → 5617.22] happening and finally Nathan w have you ever thought about doing something on amateur radio no um
[5617.86 → 5621.94] interesting hobby and there's more to it than a bunch of old white guys talking over the air
[5621.94 → 5627.86] really okay I have to admit that was sort of my perception I have heard of ham radio this many
[5627.86 → 5633.70] times yeah I don't know enough about it because I think I have the same ideas of it that you do
[5634.26 → 5642.42] um so because they included that part I was like huh and curated it okay fair enough yeah I don't know
[5643.86 → 5647.62] uh okay actually there's a few more anonymous for the lab you should get a pick and place machine
[5647.62 → 5654.50] so you can mid-scale manufacture your own electronics yeah maybe you know kyle's been bugging me uh we'll
[5654.50 → 5661.38] see we'll see uh peter says saving up gift cards for when the bag and screwdriver come up next year
[5661.38 → 5666.90] I'm hoping I can apply multiple gift cards on one order I have no idea I would think so Trevor enjoyed
[5666.90 → 5671.62] the air conditioning pc video I'm in my senior year of studying to be a mech engineer I love the engineering
[5671.62 → 5677.14] application there I'd love to see more videos like that expect it we've got some pretty cool ideas for how
[5677.14 → 5684.82] we can turn that system into something daily driver practical yeah I mean not from like a power
[5684.82 → 5691.62] efficiency standpoint no subambient is never going to be power efficient but definitely from an um not
[5691.62 → 5697.78] going to break standpoint which would be really neat and I think that's it David r we're working on the
[5697.78 → 5702.26] problems with the float plane app on android there it's already been pushed hopefully it hits your store
[5702.26 → 5706.98] soon check the app store directly because sometimes when updates come through they might just be sitting
[5706.98 → 5715.14] there, and you might not have it yet okay oh I have a quick funny story yeah hit me um that black
[5715.14 → 5720.74] it's a going away I got a thing um yes we had the Ltd Christmas party and there was a thing that i
[5720.74 → 5725.30] received I can't tell you what it was it's its very cool oh do you remember what the exact phrase was on
[5725.30 → 5732.66] it um it was about the rule that people have pants our dress code is pants our dress code is pants so
[5732.66 → 5738.42] the funny part of it there are multiple reasons why that's funny uh an additional funny part that you
[5738.42 → 5746.34] didn't know uh was so the team that I was on our colour was pink yes, and we decided to slightly alter
[5746.34 → 5753.22] the coloured scheme and go with Lamb we had team colours at our Christmas party this year um the theme
[5753.22 → 5758.74] of the party was teamwork and getting to know each other because we haven't had a haven't had an all-hands
[5758.74 → 5764.50] event in two years yeah and our team has doubled in size since then a lot of people are working
[5765.22 → 5768.90] remote for a certain amount of time, and you're supposed to space out and not interact as much
[5768.90 → 5776.34] of the office yada so which is blown yes it has um our team was pink uh we merged it with some
[5776.34 → 5781.54] green went with Lamb I thought it was really cool i was pretty happy with our team's overall
[5781.54 → 5787.70] look um, but part of the thing was at one point in time I said what should we wear for bottoms because
[5787.70 → 5791.94] we had the shirt we had all that kind of stuff figured out and Nick was like oh just wear blue
[5791.94 → 5800.10] jeans I didn't really think about it until pretty much the day of the event I didn't own pants these
[5800.10 → 5807.78] are brand new I didn't want to like talk about it when you gave me the thing because I knew we were
[5807.78 → 5819.62] running short on time but so everyone who got a five-year service award which included everyone
[5819.62 → 5825.70] who had previously crossed that milestone because we changed how we're doing our five-year service awards
[5825.70 → 5831.94] got a little phrase written on their five-year service award and the reason that Luke's was
[5831.94 → 5839.86] our dress code is pants was because his inability to manage to put pants on in the morning was the
[5839.86 → 5845.46] reason that we had to implement a dress code and our dress code is super reasonable I mean I'm not
[5845.46 → 5853.46] exactly you know the most formal dresser myself but all I ask is you put on pants because he used to
[5853.46 → 5858.58] live in the basement of the Langley house office, and he would just roll out of bed I don't I'm not even
[5858.58 → 5864.66] convinced he brushed his teeth sometimes he would roll out of bed walk upstairs to his desk plunk himself
[5864.66 → 5870.34] in whatever he happened to be wearing to bed, and it's like Luke put on pants
[5875.54 → 5882.42] so yeah i wear shorts a lot these days but yeah I didn't have any uh I didn't have any pants i
[5882.42 → 5888.18] went and bought some pants neat yeah um first piece of clothing I've bought in like years
[5888.98 → 5896.02] good for you all right last merch message Justin h says do you have any notable updates on your
[5896.02 → 5901.38] experience with the framework laptop no it's been great like what can I say about it, I mean
[5901.38 → 5905.86] when it breaks I'm sure I'll have a notable update because hopefully it'll be super easy to fix I'm kind
[5905.86 → 5910.58] of tempted to like to break it on purpose and then see how easy it is to actually get replacement parts
[5910.58 → 5914.90] because just because they in theory are replaceable doesn't mean you can actually yeah it doesn't mean
[5914.90 → 5919.14] they're available and in stock yeah shortage that's kind of interesting actually i kind of like that
[5919.14 → 5925.62] idea I mean you could theoretically break it yeah and just replace the piece anyway and see how that
[5925.62 → 5929.54] goes instead of actually breaking it that's true I could do that and just like order enough parts to
[5929.54 → 5936.82] make myself another one yeah um all right that's it for today thank you for tuning into the wand show we
[5936.82 → 5944.66] will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel okay I don't think I can roll the um
[5945.06 → 5948.02] animation oh don't we get it yeah do you want to do you want to roll the animation wait
[5948.02 → 5958.18] bye there it is bye jarred's tech
