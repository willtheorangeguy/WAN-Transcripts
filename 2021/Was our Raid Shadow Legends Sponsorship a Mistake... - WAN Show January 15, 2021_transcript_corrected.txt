[0.00 → 3.42] I call BS on it.
[4.52 → 7.32] And welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[7.46 → 10.02] We've got a fantastic show for you lined up today,
[10.12 → 12.00] brought to you by Raid Shadow Legends.
[12.86 → 15.82] Yeah! Raid Shadow Legends!
[16.26 → 20.72] I'm 100% kidding, but we will talk about that little bit of controversy
[20.72 → 21.84] that took place this week.
[22.06 → 24.96] We're also going to be talking about whether
[24.96 → 27.56] you should actually leave WhatsApp.
[27.56 → 31.88] That's right. We're going to talk about whether you should leave WhatsApp.
[32.10 → 32.94] What do you get, Luke?
[35.04 → 38.68] There's a new CEO coming into town for Intel.
[38.96 → 41.44] That's exciting and hopefully good.
[42.10 → 47.14] And Google purchases Fitbit, sort of, maybe, kind of, yeah.
[47.96 → 50.34] Hey, Android Wear couldn't get worse.
[51.44 → 52.26] Got him.
[52.40 → 52.60] Yeah.
[52.94 → 54.58] And let's roll that intro.
[57.56 → 61.78] Apparently, I'm slightly higher up.
[62.98 → 63.28] Ah.
[64.00 → 65.72] A miniature slouch?
[66.14 → 66.78] I don't even care.
[66.78 → 81.58] All right.
[81.70 → 84.00] Let's get this party started.
[84.00 → 84.26] All right.
[87.78 → 89.70] Every platform is working, guys.
[89.82 → 90.68] It's all working.
[90.80 → 92.14] It's all good.
[92.14 → 97.18] So, why don't we jump right into our headline topic of the day.
[97.84 → 106.38] Earlier this week, YouTube channel Linus Tech Tips, which is owned by Linus Media Group Incorporated,
[107.72 → 113.70] put up a video about this, like, crazy, rugged Ethernet cable that's, like, super strong,
[113.70 → 117.88] and it's resistant to being cut or crushed or torn apart.
[118.28 → 119.82] And, you know, it was a pretty cool video.
[119.94 → 120.56] Pretty cool video.
[120.98 → 121.86] People liked it.
[122.42 → 122.98] We think.
[123.54 → 132.16] We're not sure because more than 10% of the interaction with the video through the like and dislike buttons was negative, was a dislike.
[132.16 → 148.10] And it felt like a good 90% of the comments were not about the video at all, but rather about the sponsorship that took place within the video for a mobile game known as Raid Shadow Legends.
[149.00 → 155.08] So, Luke, first, I just want to thank you for coming on to the show sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends.
[155.50 → 156.08] Of course.
[156.20 → 156.42] Of course.
[156.42 → 157.24] Could you just tell me.
[157.24 → 157.92] I play every day.
[158.02 → 159.24] What's your favourite game?
[159.72 → 160.78] Is it Raid Shadow Legends?
[161.18 → 162.12] It's Raid Shadow Legends.
[162.12 → 163.28] Raid Shadow Legends.
[163.36 → 164.00] That's what I thought.
[164.14 → 167.20] Can you just tell me a little bit about what you like so much about Raid Shadow Legends?
[168.36 → 171.84] I really like the variety of characters.
[172.16 → 175.88] My favourite one is Grow dark the Orc.
[176.52 → 177.52] He's perfect.
[177.52 → 183.48] He's a five-star orc fighter, and I just really like playing the game.
[183.48 → 187.30] You really like Googling him for three seconds before the show starts today?
[188.00 → 188.70] Oh, I totally...
[188.70 → 188.98] Yeah.
[189.26 → 189.48] Yeah.
[189.76 → 190.06] Oh, yeah.
[193.98 → 195.32] I have no idea.
[196.22 → 197.40] I came up with that.
[197.48 → 198.34] I didn't even Google that.
[198.40 → 198.90] I didn't even bother.
[199.36 → 200.64] Wait, did you make that up?
[200.78 → 201.82] Grow dark is nothing?
[202.34 → 203.28] Okay, I didn't even know.
[204.94 → 207.56] I just assumed that was one of the actual heroes.
[208.40 → 209.12] No, no.
[209.20 → 210.18] Or excuse me, Legends.
[210.18 → 211.00] I just came up with that.
[211.20 → 211.52] Legends.
[211.74 → 212.98] Yes, yes, of course.
[212.98 → 213.58] Yeah.
[213.72 → 214.56] That you raid with.
[214.70 → 215.54] Grow dark the Orc.
[215.54 → 218.62] I'm not entirely sure what you raid, but you...
[218.62 → 219.68] Well, Shadows, I thought.
[220.28 → 221.02] Ah, yes.
[221.02 → 222.86] I think you raid Shadows as Legends.
[223.36 → 229.00] Although it's also possible that you raid as Shadow Legends, and what you raid is actually
[229.00 → 230.32] sort of up in the air.
[230.90 → 231.20] Yeah.
[232.90 → 236.74] Okay, so anyway, in response to the controversy, okay?
[236.74 → 242.78] So first things first, there are a lot of assumptions that we are like desperate for money, or that
[242.78 → 247.82] Raid Shadow Legends paid some kind of ludicrous fee to sponsor Linus Tech Tips video.
[248.30 → 249.52] So two things.
[249.58 → 256.42] Number one is if the hiring page on linusmediagroup.com is anything to go by, and I'm going to go ahead
[256.42 → 258.26] and pull that up for you guys right here.
[260.82 → 261.54] Linusmediagroup.com.
[261.60 → 261.92] Here we go.
[261.98 → 262.28] Here we go.
[262.32 → 262.62] Here we go.
[262.68 → 262.86] Okay.
[263.32 → 265.18] I'm going to pull that up for you guys here.
[265.24 → 266.30] I'm going to display capture.
[266.52 → 267.26] Hey, look at this guy.
[267.38 → 269.18] It's his team t-shirt here.
[269.94 → 270.30] Jobs.
[270.36 → 270.72] Here we go.
[270.72 → 277.16] If the hiring page on linusmediagroup.com is anything to go by, I think we are doing
[277.16 → 278.80] okay for money.
[278.94 → 280.78] We are actually expanding.
[281.00 → 283.22] We are in hyper-expansion mode right now.
[283.68 → 291.64] As for whether we got paid a ton, if anything, based on what I found out later that we were
[291.64 → 298.64] paid for the sponsor spot, I sent some emails to our business team asking if maybe the sponsorship
[298.64 → 304.58] rate was not competitive with what some other YouTubers might be getting from them.
[305.12 → 308.92] I did get answers that I mostly accepted.
[309.36 → 315.32] So our sponsorship deal with them was different from what other people necessarily do with
[315.32 → 315.56] them.
[315.88 → 317.16] But I'll say this.
[317.30 → 320.86] The rate was not higher or lower.
[320.98 → 325.56] It was kind of like right in the middle for us in terms of what a spot like that would cost.
[325.56 → 332.20] Um, and quite honestly, you know, whenever we don't have a spot, we have strong affiliate
[332.20 → 337.50] partners that we can kind of plonk into those spots that will, that will work out great for
[337.50 → 337.64] us.
[337.66 → 339.78] So there's no, there was no desperation.
[339.78 → 346.42] And I actually didn't even know we were doing the spot until like I read it on the Teleprompter
[346.42 → 347.86] and I was like, oh wow.
[347.94 → 349.38] So we're doing a Raid Shadow Legends spot.
[349.38 → 352.40] And the response was, yeah, it's no big deal.
[352.46 → 353.62] We've actually done one before.
[353.88 → 355.10] And I was like, oh really?
[355.44 → 357.84] And they were like, oh yeah, you probably didn't do the read for it because it was on
[357.84 → 358.34] Tech Linked.
[358.62 → 360.78] And I was like, oh, okay, sure, fine.
[361.58 → 367.66] So there are a couple of things that are bad here that I do want to acknowledge.
[367.82 → 373.16] So one is that the way the read was structured, it really did make it sound like I had a favourite
[373.16 → 378.42] hero when what I was really saying was, yeah, as part of our due diligence process with anything,
[378.42 → 381.02] we will at least use it a little bit.
[381.12 → 383.14] And by we, I don't mean necessarily me.
[383.42 → 387.10] I mean, someone at Linus Media Group will link around with it a little bit and make sure
[387.10 → 393.52] it's like, is it actually a game or is it just mining Bitcoin on your phone while you're
[393.52 → 394.74] sitting idle?
[394.96 → 398.64] You know, like, does it actually do what it says it's supposed to do?
[398.64 → 403.28] And yes, we did that due diligence, although it's not really necessary.
[403.42 → 406.58] I think everyone knows Raid Shadow Legends is an actual game.
[408.26 → 410.90] But it made it sound like I was the one who played the game.
[411.26 → 412.52] I don't play mobile games.
[412.66 → 414.44] I have enough distractions on my phone as it is.
[414.56 → 416.14] I actually, here, you know what?
[416.58 → 417.18] I'm not sure.
[417.20 → 418.22] I don't want to lie to you guys.
[418.30 → 420.04] So I'm going to make sure this is actually correct.
[420.24 → 423.44] But I don't think I have a single game installed on my phone.
[423.98 → 425.94] So I've got, so I still got the Air Canada app.
[426.02 → 426.88] Oh, no, I lied.
[426.98 → 428.08] I have 21 marbles.
[428.08 → 429.60] I actually don't know what that is.
[429.92 → 431.16] I have chess free.
[431.34 → 431.94] Did it come with your phone?
[432.04 → 432.88] I got chess free.
[433.02 → 433.70] No, no, it didn't.
[433.74 → 434.00] It didn't.
[434.10 → 435.10] I would have wiped my phone.
[435.46 → 436.84] So I got chess free up in here.
[437.18 → 437.88] Got that brilliant.
[438.08 → 439.90] It's like not really a game though.
[439.94 → 441.08] It's more of like a learning app.
[441.54 → 444.40] I got Disneyland, COVID alert.
[445.50 → 448.46] I feel like something incriminating is going to come up here at some point.
[448.54 → 450.14] Got that, got that float plane, Luke.
[450.70 → 451.02] Hey!
[451.14 → 452.42] Got that float plane right there.
[453.42 → 454.30] What else we got?
[455.16 → 455.94] You know, Grouse Mountain.
[456.10 → 456.94] It's a nice, nice mountain.
[456.94 → 459.10] You have to go there sometimes.
[459.50 → 462.48] I think I still have the Vessel app somewhere.
[462.62 → 464.10] Got my Kindle app.
[466.24 → 466.60] Retroarch.
[466.76 → 468.14] Oh, I have Retroarch on here.
[468.22 → 469.18] Okay, well, I don't use it.
[469.24 → 470.14] So that should give you some idea.
[470.82 → 472.96] I think I still, do I still have the Vessel app?
[473.04 → 473.36] Hold on.
[473.74 → 474.92] I don't know PQRSTV.
[475.00 → 476.24] Oh, no, it must have gone away at some point.
[476.30 → 477.42] Oh, got that United Airlines.
[478.34 → 479.06] Space team.
[479.06 → 481.38] What the f*** is Space team?
[481.38 → 483.70] Yeah, I think I got you to install Space team.
[483.82 → 484.60] Oh, that thing.
[484.66 → 485.74] Okay, that's pretty fun.
[485.82 → 486.32] That's pretty fun.
[486.40 → 487.82] Okay, so I lied.
[487.82 → 492.36] That's not really like, that's almost like a board game style thing.
[492.50 → 492.64] Okay.
[492.98 → 494.02] You can't play it by yourself.
[494.12 → 494.52] I lied.
[494.58 → 496.22] I have four games installed on my phone.
[496.32 → 497.80] I actually didn't know that they were there.
[498.22 → 499.82] So I shouldn't have done that.
[500.08 → 505.48] The other thing that upset me to find out about afterward is that one of the things that
[505.48 → 512.10] we've told our viewers is that while not every sponsor necessarily has to be one that
[512.10 → 517.62] I absolutely am in love with and use absolutely every day, although a lot of them are.
[517.96 → 519.86] Like you saw PIA on there.
[519.92 → 520.70] You saw Brilliant on there.
[520.70 → 526.68] These are services that I and many of the people at our company actually do use and love.
[527.32 → 532.32] What we care about a lot is the integrity of the companies that we deal with and that
[532.32 → 534.14] the product does what it says on the tin.
[534.56 → 539.92] So just because a particular product or service is not something that I need in my daily life,
[540.28 → 545.98] as long as they do what they say they're going to do and someone needs that product or service,
[546.12 → 547.70] then we got no problem with that.
[547.70 → 553.34] And Raid Shadow Legends, from what I could tell, pretty much does what it says on the
[553.34 → 553.54] tin.
[553.96 → 554.98] You raid stuff.
[555.54 → 557.30] You're like a legend or something.
[557.62 → 559.72] And you endlessly loot.
[559.82 → 561.32] I'm Grow Dark or whatever.
[561.64 → 563.00] Yeah, Grow Dark the Orc or whatever.
[563.12 → 564.80] You endlessly loot meaningless dungeons.
[565.06 → 569.16] And I thought we were all pretty freaking clear about what it was.
[569.16 → 572.80] And there are microtransactions because otherwise it wouldn't exist.
[573.58 → 575.38] And so, okay.
[575.76 → 577.32] So I was just like, yeah, okay.
[577.42 → 578.18] So like whatever.
[578.32 → 578.88] Raid Shadow Legends.
[579.00 → 582.74] As if you haven't heard of it, here's this game that I guess you can play if you really
[582.74 → 583.16] want to.
[583.42 → 586.30] We even said right in the sponsor spot.
[586.38 → 590.10] We were like, yeah, we know Raid Shadow Legends sponsorships are a bit of a meme now.
[590.50 → 594.94] But like, hey, if you never heard of it somehow, go ahead and try it.
[594.94 → 599.38] But what I found out afterward, because I asked the community, I tweeted afterward.
[599.52 → 601.74] I was like, hey, like, why are you guys so mad about this?
[602.02 → 604.34] Like, I'm not trying to be combative.
[604.46 → 606.94] I just literally want to know why.
[607.10 → 608.34] I legitimately am curious.
[608.46 → 609.30] Why are you so mad?
[609.88 → 615.94] And what they were mad about was some of the ways that Raid Shadow Legends parent company
[615.94 → 618.16] has interacted with the community in the past.
[618.16 → 625.34] So doing things like denying that they had ever, that they had ever sponsored anyone
[625.34 → 627.12] like with money.
[627.62 → 631.58] And they were like, like, yeah, like there's a tweet from a community manager or something
[631.58 → 637.04] that's like, Raid Shadow Legends is only endorsed by people who absolutely love the game and play
[637.04 → 638.30] it and just want to talk about it.
[638.32 → 640.92] We've never, we've never paid anyone for a sponsorship.
[641.24 → 643.92] And I was like, why would you even?
[644.10 → 647.74] That's like, it's like lying about the crowd size at your inauguration.
[647.74 → 652.38] It's like so easily, it's so easy to validate that that's not what happened.
[652.50 → 653.70] So why would you bother?
[654.30 → 656.16] Why are you treating me like I'm stupid?
[656.26 → 657.32] Like, it's just disrespectful.
[657.70 → 658.36] You know what I mean?
[659.32 → 661.00] So that upset me.
[662.00 → 666.12] And then the other thing is like, there are some people that were like, look, you know,
[666.28 → 669.80] it's from my point of view, it's a it's a predatory business.
[669.80 → 675.76] And so we don't like to see you guys effectively profiting off of that kind of predatory business
[675.76 → 676.08] model.
[676.08 → 683.72] And in fairness, you know, I think that it, or I think that is a fair viewpoint, but I
[683.72 → 690.48] also think that it's going to be a very different line that any individual is going to draw.
[690.68 → 693.44] So would you say the same thing of World of Warships?
[694.00 → 695.12] It's free to play.
[695.12 → 698.44] It has microtransactions up the butt.
[698.96 → 705.08] They have, they have done some very, very questionable things with their community.
[705.26 → 708.96] Like there was that holiday thing where there were a bunch of challenges or something.
[709.38 → 713.92] And if you complete them, you get like this epic legendary ship or something like that.
[713.92 → 719.00] But members of the community did the math, and it was like actually completely physically,
[719.20 → 721.80] humanly impossible to complete.
[722.20 → 724.52] Like within the time window that they had for it.
[724.56 → 727.62] And they just like, unless you do some microtransaction stuff.
[727.62 → 732.82] Like, no, you just like actually could not, or yeah, you couldn't get it for free basically.
[733.06 → 735.90] But they were saying you could do it for free if I recall correctly.
[736.14 → 742.50] So it's like, but people are mostly not mad about World of Warships because the general
[742.50 → 746.02] consensus among the community is that it's not like, it's not to pay to win.
[746.02 → 751.42] So here's where I had decided I thought Raid Shadow Legends was okay.
[751.70 → 758.38] The fact that it is a single player experience for me made it not pay to win in a sense that
[758.38 → 758.80] mattered.
[759.14 → 764.50] I never thought of winning a single player game as mattering at all.
[764.60 → 769.30] Like I have gotten into games that are very microtransaction-y.
[769.46 → 772.20] Like what's that, what's that tower, Tiny Tower?
[772.46 → 775.00] I loved Tiny Tower like years ago.
[775.00 → 779.34] And it really bothered me when it gets to the point in the game where you can only do
[779.34 → 781.60] like two things, and then you have to wait to the next day.
[782.22 → 788.12] And yeah, or that last Lord of the Rings, um, Shadows of Mordor game where you could do
[788.12 → 791.84] like, I think it was three quarters of the game, but then the last quarter of the game
[791.84 → 796.80] is like, yeah, it's, it's probably possible without microtransactions, but they make it
[796.80 → 798.40] just a horrible experience.
[798.84 → 803.48] So for me, it was as simple as, okay, I'm just going to stop playing Tiny Tower.
[803.48 → 806.22] And I see it.
[806.32 → 809.66] I see, I see all the different perspectives here.
[810.00 → 814.78] Um, but the reason that I had decided I thought it was fine to just take their money and run
[814.78 → 817.74] was because there was no one that you were winning against.
[817.94 → 819.04] So who cares?
[819.82 → 821.08] Um, yeah.
[821.08 → 826.14] And honestly, there, so there was some legitimate feedback like that.
[826.40 → 831.74] I'm explaining why I thought it was okay in spite of that feedback, but most of the negative
[831.74 → 836.84] feedback really seemed to come down to, I'm just tired of hearing about Raid Shadow Legends.
[836.84 → 845.36] And so I guess like, I guess I just don't really know how to, I don't really know how to address
[845.36 → 845.64] that.
[845.74 → 852.24] Like, it's not my fault that Raid Shadow Legends or Dyson or whoever else decides to do a big
[852.24 → 855.88] marketing push when they decide to do it and that I happen to be part of it.
[855.88 → 863.54] Um, and the problem for me is that even though most people in the community, like even in
[863.54 → 866.96] the chat right now, people are like, yeah, whatever, who cares?
[867.48 → 872.18] Like, thank you for doing your sponsorships in a way where all I have to do is double tap
[872.18 → 875.42] the right arrow key and I don't have to listen to it at all.
[875.42 → 879.80] Like the way that we integrate it really is meant to be completely seamless for a tech
[879.80 → 880.48] savvy viewer.
[880.88 → 883.14] You're no big deal.
[883.80 → 890.28] Um, but that small number of like sort of people who are really upset about it kind of
[890.28 → 892.26] ruins the experience for us as content creators.
[892.26 → 898.44] Like Luke, think back to when you uploaded a video that you wrote, and you hosted and you
[898.44 → 901.14] felt like 98% of it was really great content.
[901.58 → 902.02] Yeah.
[902.14 → 902.34] Okay.
[902.44 → 904.46] I'm sure I've already led you enough on this one.
[904.46 → 905.26] Talk about that.
[905.86 → 906.14] Yeah.
[906.18 → 907.16] It's well, it's frustrating.
[907.16 → 909.60] Cause like you, you make this piece.
[910.14 → 914.24] Um, and I, I can think back to quite a few different videos that I would have been notably
[914.24 → 914.86] proud of.
[914.86 → 919.18] I'm not, I don't necessarily remember the comment sections on them at this time, but you
[919.18 → 921.78] make this thing, and you're really, really excited about it.
[921.78 → 928.38] And then all the comments are about some, like some stupid thing, whether it's like, I guess
[928.38 → 935.18] the ad spot, if they didn't like the ad spot or like you had a pimple or like some, something
[935.18 → 938.18] like walks past in the background or something.
[938.18 → 943.56] And just all the comments are about this, like extremely, to me at least inconsequential
[943.56 → 944.62] thing that happened.
[944.62 → 946.88] And it's like, no, like I, I did this thing.
[946.94 → 947.40] That's cool.
[947.40 → 948.40] Let's talk about that.
[948.40 → 950.80] But yeah, it's, it's, it's frustrating for sure.
[950.80 → 951.80] It can be a downer.
[951.80 → 957.52] Um, so it's one of those things where I think for the time being, we're probably not going
[957.52 → 964.76] to work with them, but honestly, it doesn't have much to do with, um, it doesn't have much
[964.76 → 969.62] to do with me thinking that their business model is particularly that different from any
[969.62 → 975.60] other like pay to win mobile game or really anything that's got a lot of microtransactions
[975.60 → 976.60] in it.
[976.60 → 978.60] To me, it's all kind of the same thing.
[978.60 → 983.88] Um, it's just more to do with like, I guess for better or for worse, the, the community
[983.88 → 987.36] is, has decided that they do not accept this.
[987.36 → 994.10] And so in the interest of me having fun making videos, I'm, I'm just going to not, I'm just
[994.10 → 995.60] going to not do it for now.
[995.60 → 1001.60] Um, and again, like I said, I don't like dealing with companies that I don't think do a good
[1001.60 → 1006.10] job of maintaining transparency because that's really important to me.
[1006.10 → 1012.20] I mean, I don't care if your product is like a toe, like thing that's designed to help you
[1012.20 → 1013.36] slice off your own toe.
[1013.36 → 1018.22] Like if it's as long as you're honest about it, you know, like as long as you don't advertise
[1018.22 → 1022.90] it as like a, you know, a cordless, you know, sandwich grill or something like that.
[1022.90 → 1024.26] And then it like slices off your toe.
[1024.26 → 1027.48] If you're like, yeah, this is for like, if you feel like you have too many toes and you
[1027.48 → 1029.84] want to cut one off, that's what it does.
[1029.84 → 1031.72] You want to live that totalist life.
[1031.72 → 1033.14] We're here to help you.
[1033.14 → 1037.96] As far as I'm concerned, as long as the talking points are straightforward and are like, I
[1037.96 → 1040.60] get, I can be honest with the viewers about what exactly it does.
[1040.60 → 1043.60] Like it doesn't, it doesn't matter much to me.
[1043.60 → 1044.60] So here's the thing.
[1044.60 → 1045.60] Okay.
[1045.60 → 1048.18] Like we got a lot of really sorts of irrational stuff here.
[1048.18 → 1052.10] Gamer 456 ism says the game is a scam.
[1052.10 → 1053.74] What do you mean scam?
[1053.74 → 1054.74] How is it a scam?
[1054.74 → 1055.74] It's a bullpen.
[1055.74 → 1059.82] Honestly, um, I'm bringing this message from AJ, and he's, he's very, very, very, very, very,
[1059.82 → 1060.82] right about this.
[1060.82 → 1066.54] I can, I can understand the anger over the ad and there is actually, um, a pretty good
[1066.54 → 1072.70] solution that can be enacted, uh, by, by anyone frustrated or anyone not frustrated by the
[1072.70 → 1075.70] Raid Town Legends ad to be completely honest.
[1075.70 → 1076.70] It's simple.
[1076.70 → 1079.12] The process isn't that difficult.
[1079.12 → 1082.78] Um, it's like a few clicks to be completely honest.
[1082.78 → 1083.78] Get on with it.
[1083.78 → 1084.96] See the same content.
[1084.96 → 1086.84] You just subscribe on Flow play.
[1086.84 → 1089.84] I think I,
[1089.84 → 1094.00] No, it's all, no more Raid Shadow Legends ads.
[1094.00 → 1095.00] No big deal.
[1095.00 → 1098.84] I didn't even know this was a problem because I just watched content on Flow play.
[1098.84 → 1099.84] All right.
[1099.84 → 1100.84] All right.
[1100.84 → 1101.84] So easy.
[1101.84 → 1106.16] Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.
[1106.16 → 1109.34] This is another highly controversial topic right now.
[1109.34 → 1112.84] James actually put a freaking ton of notes in the document.
[1112.84 → 1113.84] Yeah.
[1113.84 → 1117.20] It's funny because I had a meeting with him recently where he talked about how he was going
[1117.20 → 1122.64] to talk to one of the other writers about putting less detailed notes in the doc because
[1122.64 → 1126.40] he and the writer who wrote it were realistically the only ones that were actually going to read
[1126.40 → 1130.64] it to that level of detail because he knows that like we don't read them carefully.
[1130.64 → 1133.76] We need something we can skim these like giant paragraphs.
[1133.76 → 1136.20] But there is actually some perfect info here.
[1136.20 → 1137.82] So why don't we run through some of it?
[1137.82 → 1141.16] The question is, should you leave WhatsApp?
[1141.16 → 1142.16] Yes.
[1142.16 → 1143.16] So let's go.
[1143.16 → 1146.16] Uh, it, it, it varies.
[1146.16 → 1151.72] Basically some of the information that was, that was disseminated, uh, very recently about
[1151.72 → 1156.40] WhatsApp and about the information that was going to be shared between WhatsApp and Facebook
[1156.40 → 1158.64] Facebook, uh, was, was incorrect.
[1158.64 → 1164.76] There has been clarifications posted by Facebook explaining what's going on and essentially,
[1164.76 → 1170.04] uh, information messages, et cetera, between yourself and like your friends or family members
[1170.04 → 1173.16] or whatever is theoretically not going to be shared.
[1173.16 → 1179.48] Uh, it's just going to be messages between you and a business on WhatsApp, um, that is shared,
[1179.48 → 1182.04] uh, that is optional at the same time.
[1182.04 → 1189.24] Um, and users who opted out of all information sharing back in 2016, I believe are opted out
[1189.24 → 1191.28] of this, but no other users are.
[1191.28 → 1194.04] Um, it, it, yeah.
[1194.04 → 1198.28] So it's not like all the information on WhatsApp, it's just the business stuff.
[1198.28 → 1203.76] Um, and your, your, your messages between friends, family, et cetera, are still encrypted
[1203.76 → 1205.04] and whatnot.
[1205.04 → 1210.04] And I believe they even use, uh, yeah, they use the signal protocol anyway.
[1210.04 → 1215.44] Um, and signal is the main thing people are pointing, including myself are pointing, um,
[1215.44 → 1216.60] that people should go use.
[1216.60 → 1221.72] So, uh, I would still just move over to signal personally.
[1221.72 → 1225.04] Um, I think that's still the answer.
[1225.04 → 1229.54] I just think the reason for that answer has definitely changed, and it's not as bad of a
[1229.54 → 1234.04] situation as we thought it was, which is good, but I would still move to signal personal.
[1234.04 → 1239.32] So from my point of view, this does make me feel a lot more comfortable.
[1239.32 → 1245.32] Um, you know, my understanding, not looking at it that closely initially was like, oh,
[1245.32 → 1246.32] okay.
[1246.32 → 1251.60] Basically WhatsApp is now another data collection tentacle that Facebook.
[1251.60 → 1256.60] I thought it was to, to squirm their way into the details of your life.
[1256.60 → 1261.40] And I was extremely frustrated because the reason I used WhatsApp in the first place was
[1261.40 → 1265.84] because my understanding was that it was end-to-end encrypted and that the service provider
[1265.84 → 1271.00] would not have any access to the communication that I was sending and receiving over it.
[1271.00 → 1272.68] So that was like the whole freaking point.
[1272.68 → 1277.64] And it's like, it started to feel like, man, am I going to have to do this like every couple
[1277.64 → 1278.76] of years?
[1278.76 → 1284.92] So when Google or Microsoft comes in and buys signal another year or two from now, am I going
[1284.92 → 1290.24] to have to like keep jumping between messaging applications?
[1290.24 → 1294.76] And now that I see this, I'm like, oh, maybe it's like, it's not that I don't still think
[1294.76 → 1301.72] it's a good idea to switch over to signal or telegram, but it's more like, um, is it worth
[1301.72 → 1309.32] the hassle, but then there's a danger there. If every time we ask this question, Facebook is kind
[1309.32 → 1315.08] of moving the, moving the goalposts just a little bit straight up lied about this stuff in the past.
[1315.08 → 1319.08] Yes. So if they're moving the goalposts, just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit.
[1319.08 → 1323.40] And every time it's like not enough, it's not worth the hassle. It's not worth the hassle.
[1323.40 → 1328.68] It's not worth the hassle. Um, then there is that danger that at some point you're going to end up
[1328.68 → 1335.64] way past the line where you intended to be. And, um, and you're going to be somewhere where you feel
[1335.64 → 1341.32] like you've forgotten that you're not comfortable with it. That's, that's the reason why I might look
[1341.32 → 1351.72] at it and go, yeah, okay, this is, this is probably worth it. Yeah. I just, Facebook has, has lied to the
[1351.72 → 1358.60] face of everyone they possibly could in the past about this type of stuff. Um, so the
[1358.60 → 1365.48] clarification is good, and it makes me less like I need to make sure everyone I know gets off of
[1365.48 → 1370.20] this thing. Yeah. Um, but I would still suggest that people move off of WhatsApp.
[1370.20 → 1371.48] Now let's go back and let's.
[1371.48 → 1374.04] Clearly getting their, their grubby little fingers in there.
[1374.04 → 1378.92] Let's talk about that mentality. Like the everyone I know absolutely needs to get off of this mentality.
[1378.92 → 1383.56] Cause the cold hard truth is that most of the people, you know, already use Facebook anyway.
[1384.04 → 1388.28] And I don't want to be that guy. That's like, well, you shouldn't care about your privacy
[1388.28 → 1396.52] because it's already not private, but if you already use Facebook, who cares? Honestly,
[1396.52 → 1401.56] Sort of. It depends on what you're using it for. I think the text messages are quite all encompassing
[1401.56 → 1409.24] and you get text messages from, um, of like, like any time there's any security hole. Like if, if,
[1409.80 → 1414.76] if Facebook is like, yeah, we're going to share this information internally, that's increasing the amount of,
[1414.76 → 1421.80] um, points of access. So like if, if you don't have that, that's good. I can, I got a text message
[1421.80 → 1428.28] from my credit card company today. That was unfortunate. Um, but it's, it's something that
[1428.28 → 1434.60] can happen. Right. So like, I would rather those messages were private. Um, and, and at least myself,
[1434.60 → 1438.20] personally, like I have a Facebook account. I originally made that Facebook account because
[1438.20 → 1440.76] people were making fake ones of me. And that was annoying.
[1440.76 → 1447.48] I remember that, actually. Yeah. And I, I only use it for communication with my like, very,
[1447.48 → 1452.44] very, very close family and I don't have it installed on my phone. Right. So like, it's not
[1452.44 → 1457.88] able to scrape info from, from that point. It's, it's only in a browser and I only use it for that
[1457.88 → 1463.88] type of communication. So it's pretty limited. And I feel like a lot of people's usage of Facebook
[1463.88 → 1470.60] these days is becoming more and more limited. Best in, um, getting, getting one of those kits and
[1470.60 → 1477.32] getting tested. And I had expressed my, uh, strong preference that they not do it because of how
[1477.32 → 1483.64] closely blood related they were to me and how much information that puts out there about me. Um, and
[1483.64 → 1488.12] they went and did it anyway. So I'm like, actually, I'm still like pretty off about that. I'm,
[1488.12 → 1495.40] I'm not impressed. Uh, I sent like a very, I've very long detailed, and I think very cogent argument
[1495.40 → 1503.00] for why I felt like it was important for them to not do that. Um, and I was ignored. So there's,
[1503.64 → 1509.16] there's like, uh, there's a certain amount of just respect for the people that you correspond with when
[1509.16 → 1514.36] it comes to choosing secure messaging applications. Actually, I'm, I'm all fired up about this now.
[1514.36 → 1518.76] So here's, here's what I sent. I've been deciding whether to send this or not. It might affect
[1518.76 → 1522.44] whether you decide, it might not affect whether you decide to use the genetic test you got for
[1522.44 → 1526.20] Christmas, but these tests are not well regulated, and we've only begun to explore the way that the
[1526.20 → 1529.96] data in them will be used by private companies and government entities. I felt like I needed to speak
[1529.96 → 1535.00] up. Here's some reading material. When you do one of these genetic tests, and I linked to an article
[1535.00 → 1538.36] that kind of explained it, uh, when you do one of these generic tests, it doesn't just affect you and
[1538.36 → 1542.52] your privacy. It affects anyone related to you, including me, helping them build out their database.
[1542.52 → 1546.36] Their privacy policy may prevent them from selling individualized data at this time, but we've seen
[1546.36 → 1550.12] many times that Silicon Valley companies will start out with robust privacy policies
[1550.12 → 1553.96] and slowly tip away at them over time. We've also seen acquisitions and mergers that do not
[1553.96 → 1558.20] preserve these protections. The issue is that unlike an interest in cars or whatever,
[1558.20 → 1562.76] your genetic information doesn't change. So this data is given up permanently. I'm not a tinfoil hat
[1562.76 → 1566.52] wearer by any stretch of the imagination, but given what is already accessible to advertisers,
[1566.52 → 1570.76] insurance agencies, et cetera, I would rather pay for you to have a genetic test done in a medical
[1570.76 → 1574.92] slash diagnostic setting. If you really want to know that way, the data will at least have a chance
[1574.92 → 1582.28] of being safe. And basically what was sent back to me was, um, your message adds to the consideration
[1582.28 → 1589.24] for sure in more words. Um, and then I never heard back and I, it was sort of mentioned in offhand
[1589.24 → 1595.40] conversation later that this individual had just gone ahead with it. And I, I don't know. I just,
[1595.40 → 1600.20] I felt, I felt very, I felt kind of violated to be honest with you. I would have like,
[1600.20 → 1604.92] if I was that person, I would have absolutely just taken you up on your offer and been like,
[1604.92 → 1610.84] Hey, I can get a better one done. That's also like more confidential, like cool. I would have been
[1610.84 → 1616.92] happy to pay for it. Like if that's a that's a trivial expense from my point of view for something
[1616.92 → 1624.12] like this. Um, and I know that I do tend to have a pretty, uh, uh, laissez-faire attitude when it comes
[1624.12 → 1628.92] to things like my digital information, at least that, which I decide to share publicly.
[1628.92 → 1635.16] And the reason for that is, you know, back to the, the ship has sailed argument. My ship has sailed.
[1635.16 → 1642.20] I am a digital influencer at this point. There are literally thousands of hours of footage of me
[1642.20 → 1650.36] on Google and Facebook servers. Like my privacy is done. So, you know, if Google wanted to,
[1650.36 → 1655.40] they could know absolutely everything about me based on just cross-referencing information that
[1655.40 → 1659.88] I've, things that I've talked about, things that I've shown in videos, uh, nothing is a secret to
[1659.88 → 1664.76] them about me at this point. But you know, something like, again, back to the argument that
[1664.76 → 1669.56] I made about genetic information and the fact that it doesn't change and that it's just irreversible.
[1669.56 → 1675.32] Like it's not, this is not a trivial, like, Oh gee, I wonder if I have some like Irish in me.
[1675.32 → 1680.20] This is, that's not that kind of decision you're making. That's a terrible, terrible approach.
[1680.76 → 1687.56] So yeah, again, back to WhatsApp then for me, like, you know, what, what I ate for dinner or like what
[1688.20 → 1693.40] widget I'm thinking of buying, like the things, the kinds of things that I talk about in text message,
[1693.40 → 1699.40] um, to me, it's not, is not terribly important, but I'm also in kind of unique position where I do
[1699.40 → 1705.80] literally none of my own confidential communication. Like I don't do any of my own banking. My, my
[1705.80 → 1714.84] wonderful, uh, chief financial officer over there does all of it. So I don't know. So Luke, tell me
[1714.84 → 1720.52] this, would you feel, would you feel betrayed if I was like, no, Luke, forget it. I'm staying on
[1720.52 → 1722.92] WhatsApp. And if you want to talk to me, you're going to have to talk to me on WhatsApp.
[1729.40 → 1734.60] Are you thinking you're muted? Oh, okay. I was thinking, no, I don't think so. My reason is just
[1735.72 → 1741.96] that I would censor my communications to you. Sure. And that's fair. That's fair. And that would
[1741.96 → 1746.76] have to just be the trade-off is it's going to be like a partially muted conversation. I think both
[1746.76 → 1753.08] you and I are kind of chat application chameleons though. Like there's people that I encounter like
[1753.64 → 1761.32] in the real actual world that are like, Hey, you know, don't bother applying to join this group or
[1761.32 → 1768.12] this team. If you don't use iMessage or like, don't bother replying to this dating profile. If you don't
[1768.12 → 1775.80] use iMessage or, and I'm sitting here going, what? Like I was talking to James about this earlier. That's
[1775.80 → 1782.84] one of the reasons that this, uh, this is in the doc. And I was like, yeah, like to me, what difference does it
[1782.84 → 1789.80] make? You know, what application shows at the top of the notification shade or like whether this one
[1789.80 → 1797.16] supports stickers or that one has an emoji or this one has cheers or like who cares? There are no less
[1797.16 → 1804.28] than, I think it was 10, 10 chat apps. And I counted things like Twitter and Instagram as like private
[1804.28 → 1808.36] messaging apps, because realistically that's like what they are for a lot of people. There was no less
[1808.36 → 1815.48] than 10 on my phone. And I'm just like, so what? So I think you have kind of a similar attitude to
[1815.48 → 1821.08] me where you'll just kind of use whatever other people happen to use. But some people are very set
[1821.08 → 1827.00] in their ways. They're like, I only use this. It's like, well, I have like, we have, we have different,
[1827.00 → 1833.56] like, I am different layers of, of chat apps, essentially like for the same person.
[1833.56 → 1834.28] What layer am I in?
[1835.32 → 1837.24] Well, no, but like for each person.
[1837.24 → 1840.04] Am I in the am I in the top? Am I in the highest tier layer?
[1843.40 → 1848.12] You depend on how you define each layer, but like, there's like,
[1848.12 → 1851.40] like, cop out answer. Like I generally don't send people.
[1855.40 → 1859.88] Like I, I'll try to keep Slack messages mostly focused on work.
[1860.44 → 1864.52] Yeah. If I want to send you a message about some game thing, I'll probably send you a message over
[1864.52 → 1870.28] discord. If I'm trying to send a Linus a message about work, honestly, we chat about most things on,
[1870.28 → 1875.32] on teams, but sometimes I'll try to keep the more off-topic things on discord. I'll keep the more work
[1875.32 → 1880.60] focused things on teams. I'll like certain things will go to email. If it's something that I think
[1880.60 → 1884.52] should be like searchable, like there's, there are a bunch of different reasons why something is going
[1884.52 → 1891.08] to go through a certain method or not. Yeah. Um, that's fair. I just use everything and try to just
[1891.08 → 1896.04] gauge like which one makes most sense at whatever time. And I'm kind of the same way, like without
[1896.04 → 1899.96] really thinking about it, hearing you talk about that, it's totally the same. So whenever I'm talking
[1899.96 → 1905.08] about something personal and or confidential, WhatsApp has actually been my tool of choice. So, um,
[1905.08 → 1913.64] Yvonne and I almost exclusively talk through WhatsApp about anything that is like HR related or, um,
[1913.64 → 1920.04] or personal and private personal or private, whether it's work or, or personal, if it's private, it is kind
[1920.04 → 1927.00] of goes in WhatsApp, uh, because as much as it annoys me, a feature of WhatsApp for better or for worse is
[1927.00 → 1931.96] that it's only logged in on one device at a time. So there's no risk of me accidentally leaving my laptop
[1931.96 → 1938.04] around or a secondary phone that I have signed in and somebody seeing a highly confidential upper
[1938.04 → 1943.88] management message. Um, because it'll only be on the phone that's in my pocket. So that's a reason
[1943.88 → 1949.08] for that. And then I just have some legacy people that we've just kind of always used hangouts. So I
[1949.08 → 1954.28] still chat on Hangouts there, uh, with you. Yep. It tends to be discord and teams or realistically,
[1954.28 → 1959.08] because you never check your messages anyway. Um, I'll just call you if I actually need to
[1959.08 → 1963.24] communicate with you. So there's that, especially outside of hours. Yeah.
[1964.84 → 1974.44] I, uh, yeah. Like I still talk to James through hangouts. I usually use hangouts or teams with
[1974.44 → 1979.16] the Vaughn. Like it's, I kind of, but I don't even really have to think about or remember these things.
[1979.16 → 1983.72] It's just like, Oh, I have to message this person. I just kind of automatically go to whatever thing
[1983.72 → 1989.64] I'm used to using with that person. We need like, we need a new, um, a new pigeon trillion. Yeah.
[1989.64 → 1996.04] Or yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. I've met. So this is an older code, sir, but it checks out.
[1998.44 → 2001.48] What was trillion? It was ICQ aim and
[2001.48 → 2008.76] I forget what the third one was. It was called trillion because there were three messaging and MSN.
[2008.76 → 2016.28] I think it also did MSN. I just want, if the day that Microsoft launches MSN messenger,
[2018.12 → 2025.24] I will go to it immediately just to be back on MSN. Just to hear those notification sounds again, man.
[2025.96 → 2031.88] I love it. I love it. It's one thing. It's something that I've never really understood.
[2031.88 → 2040.44] Like how, how people as a whole migrate from one platform to another and why they bother,
[2040.44 → 2046.76] like why it was super trendy to be on aim and then super trendy to be on ICQ and then super trendy to be
[2046.76 → 2053.08] on MSN. And is it just as simple as, as soon as the parent generation joins it, it's not cool anymore.
[2053.08 → 2056.12] And you have to get off. Like why did it ever matter?
[2056.12 → 2059.56] That might be part of the reason why Facebook's sort of falling a little bit.
[2059.56 → 2064.52] Well, that's totally part of the reason why Facebook is falling in popularity with like with boomers.
[2064.52 → 2069.00] But it's like, it's not like some of these applications haven't had things like,
[2069.80 → 2074.44] like shadow, do not disturb and things like that. Like, it's not like you couldn't just pretend to your parents
[2074.44 → 2079.32] that you're not online. It was always the thing like MSN had that you could appear offline to people.
[2079.32 → 2083.48] And you know, when you caught a friend doing it, it was so scandalous, of course.
[2085.08 → 2090.60] Were you able to, uh, were you able to show offline to individuals or was it one big flag?
[2090.60 → 2099.08] I believe you could appear offline to individuals, MSN messenger. I believe you did.
[2099.72 → 2104.84] How to have MSN messenger show is appeared offline upon boot up. Yeah, that was a really inconvenient thing.
[2104.84 → 2111.00] There was a while where I remember this. There was a while where it was kind of bugged so that if you signed in as appear offline,
[2111.00 → 2115.32] it would show you online for a second and then immediately offline. And people would be like,
[2116.36 → 2118.04] um, I know you're there.
[2120.84 → 2125.80] Man, I remember you mentioned scandalous. Uh, I remember one of my friends used to,
[2125.80 → 2133.08] uh, when someone wouldn't tell them a secret, they'd be like, oh, just tell me in like windings or whatever,
[2133.08 → 2140.84] Wingdings. And then he would bring them into word and convert the font. Um, that was actually hilarious.
[2140.84 → 2143.16] Oh, no, that's right. It worked for whatever reason.
[2143.16 → 2147.88] So you could appear offline in MSN messenger, but you could still initiate chats.
[2149.24 → 2153.08] So you could totally chat as you are, as you are offline.
[2153.08 → 2159.08] Um, how to appear offline. Does anybody have any video like that? I'm looking for how to appear offline.
[2159.08 → 2164.36] Okay. Yeah. Oh, apparently there was like tools that you could use to appear offline to just one person.
[2164.36 → 2168.92] But for my part, I think a lot of the time I was just in a peer offline, and then I would just chat with people.
[2168.92 → 2171.00] I actually wanted to chat with. Right.
[2171.00 → 2176.68] Uh, you know what we should probably do. Speaking of chatting is chat with you guys about our sponsors.
[2176.68 → 2181.88] Oh, wait. So hold on. There's one more thing we got to go through here. So ranking message services,
[2181.88 → 2186.76] security, uh, signal encrypts end to end, does not back up your messages to iCloud or its own servers.
[2186.76 → 2191.32] This is the most secure option. And also the option that's most likely to lead to data loss or getting
[2191.32 → 2195.80] locked out of your own account. So that's a trade-off. WhatsApp still does encrypt your messages end to
[2195.80 → 2199.96] end with the same protocol as signal and does not back up your messages to its own servers.
[2199.96 → 2203.00] By default, it does not back up messages to iCloud either, but that is an option.
[2203.00 → 2207.96] I've also found that its backup is extremely spotty. The only way to get it to work is to like
[2207.96 → 2213.48] specifically back it up, then log out, then log in on the other one. If you, if you kind of screw
[2213.48 → 2218.68] up that order, then you can be missing a bunch of stuff, which is interesting. Uh, if you enable the
[2218.68 → 2222.60] option, your messages can be accessed by Apple who has the keys for iCloud. And by extension, it can be
[2222.60 → 2227.64] accessed by law enforcement without a warrant. Number three is a tie between Telegram and Facebook
[2227.64 → 2231.32] messenger. So they do not end to end encrypt. I actually didn't know that Telegram does not
[2231.32 → 2235.64] end to end encrypt by default. They are stored on Telegram servers where they are secured by
[2235.64 → 2239.32] Telegram's keys, but they can also be seen by law enforcement. So yeah, it looks like signal's
[2239.32 → 2244.20] basically just the way to go. And then there's iMessage, blah, blah, blah messages accessed by Apple,
[2244.20 → 2249.16] et cetera, through iCloud, unless you turn that off, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2249.16 → 2253.64] So yeah, signal is the way to go. If you actually want to be private, honestly, I'm lazy and
[2253.64 → 2258.04] everyone I want to talk to is already kind of on WhatsApp. So I'm just probably going to stick
[2258.04 → 2262.20] with it for now, unless things get really bad. By the way, there's a super chat here that I
[2262.20 → 2269.00] definitely want to respond to. Irritating this says, Hey Linus, take my missing pin 5950X and try
[2269.00 → 2273.56] to make another repair video. Otherwise, I'll have to find another way to get rid of it. Hate having it just
[2273.56 → 2279.08] sit. I'm super down. Cause like those things are impossible to get. And we actually could use them
[2279.08 → 2284.76] for other projects, and we can't buy them or get them from AMD at this point. So I'm super down.
[2284.76 → 2290.68] Just message the business email that's linked on the YouTube page and some someone somewhere will
[2290.68 → 2302.76] read your message at some point. Oh, snap. Just got a message from Jake. Got one ingest station running 25
[2302.76 → 2309.06] gigabit. Had to do some like wacko configs to change the type of port on the 100 gigabit switch to
[2309.08 → 2313.80] a 40 gig port to get the two switches to talk. Oh, okay. That's interesting works now.
[2314.92 → 2322.68] That is sick. So we are going 25 gigabit fibre for all of our ingest stations and all of our editing
[2322.68 → 2328.52] stations as of, uh, this coming week, I think we're going to roll it out. So both Jake and I are like
[2329.16 → 2334.52] pretty jazzed right now on how sick that's going to be. That's awesome. It's going to be just like,
[2334.52 → 2339.64] I mean, think about 25 gigabits. That's two and a half gigabytes per second. I mean,
[2339.64 → 2346.60] it was not that long ago that the fastest internal drive that you could install in your computer was
[2346.60 → 2356.36] like, uh, 250, 300 megabytes a second. Like that was SATA 2. That wasn't that freaking long ago. It's like
[2356.36 → 2365.48] 10 years ago. Now we're talking two and a half gigabytes per second over the network. Had to go
[2365.48 → 2369.80] fibre though, man. You haven't been in the office in forever. You're not even going to recognize it.
[2369.80 → 2375.24] It's been a very long time. I know I will not. We did 17 fibre runs down in the editing den. So we
[2375.24 → 2379.88] could have up to 17 editors down there once COVID is not a thing, and we can kind of pack them in
[2379.88 → 2387.08] a bit more. I am, I am excited. I am excited for all that to be done. That's pretty insane.
[2387.08 → 2391.64] All right. Sponsors for the show today. The show is brought to you by
[2392.84 → 2399.48] Back blaze. Back blaze is an unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $6 a month. They've
[2399.48 → 2405.40] restored over 35 billion files for their clients, and they can back up anything, you know, docs,
[2405.40 → 2411.00] music, photos, videos, drawings, projects, all the data and restore them from anywhere. You can
[2411.00 → 2415.32] download them directly on your computer. You can access them on your mobile phone. Furthermore, you can even
[2415.32 → 2419.96] purchase a restore via hard drive. If your internet's not too fast, and they will overnight FedEx it to
[2419.96 → 2423.08] you, you copy it to something else, you ship it back to them. You get a refund for the drive.
[2423.72 → 2428.52] Absolutely a sick. There's no wonky cost structures,
[2428.52 → 2433.56] just unlimited data backup at a fixed price. So check it out at backblaze.com slash when.
[2433.56 → 2437.64] And this is an example of a sponsor that we do actually use. I mean, not Linus Media Group
[2437.64 → 2441.24] directly, but Flow plane uses Back blaze or am I not supposed to say that?
[2443.40 → 2444.44] It's probably fine, right?
[2444.44 → 2450.12] I don't know. This is why Luke tries not to tell me too much about the infra.
[2450.76 → 2455.64] Because I tend to like, there shouldn't be any like concerns for people talking about that, right?
[2455.64 → 2459.08] I'm not, I'm genuinely not 100% certain if we currently do.
[2459.08 → 2460.68] Oh, okay. I know we did at one point.
[2460.68 → 2464.92] Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, my mic's a little hot. I just noticed that.
[2464.92 → 2471.40] All right. The show is also brought to you by privacy. Privacy is a tool that makes it super easy
[2471.40 → 2477.08] to manage your financial life online while keeping all of your most important information secure. By
[2477.08 → 2482.44] generating virtual numbers when you're making purchases, privacy masks your real banking information.
[2482.44 → 2487.24] So you never have to worry about giving it out to people you don't know online. You can set up a
[2487.24 → 2491.96] spending limit to what you should be paying with that service per month. So you can catch any sneaky
[2491.96 → 2497.96] up charges or rate adjustments. And you can easily and safely send a friend, family member, or co-worker
[2497.96 → 2503.40] a privacy card straight from your dashboard in just a few clicks. So head to privacy.com slash Linus and
[2503.40 → 2509.24] sign up to get $5 to spend on your first purchase. Privacy is an example of one of our sponsors that I know
[2509.24 → 2513.16] has a great service, even though I can't use, but I would love to use, but it's not available in
[2513.16 → 2521.96] Canada yet. So as soon as it's available in Canada, I'm going to be super into it. Yes, me too.
[2521.96 → 2526.28] And finally, the show is brought to you by PIA. This is one I've been using for years,
[2526.28 → 2534.44] one that I've been absolutely pleased with and doesn't do. Some of the stuff that some people who
[2534.44 → 2541.96] take VPN sponsorships say it does. It's not magic. It's just part of your overall private
[2541.96 → 2548.28] browsing toolkit to help websites and applications and tools that you use believe that you are some
[2548.28 → 2554.84] anonymous person from some other country. It masks your IP and encrypts traffic to and from your device.
[2554.84 → 2560.60] It's not magic. That's what it does. So they've got configurable encryption and internet kill switch
[2560.60 → 2564.68] to keep you in control of your connection. So nothing will accidentally leak out if the VPN
[2564.68 → 2570.52] becomes disconnected for whatever reason. And they have over 24,000 servers in 77 countries.
[2570.52 → 2574.52] You can turn it on manually, or you can set your client so it's enabled automatically, and you can
[2574.52 → 2579.40] try it out risk-free with their 30-day money-back guarantee, which is down below. Also down below
[2579.40 → 2584.12] is an interview I did with them on their YouTube channel talking all about privacy. Okay, cool.
[2584.12 → 2590.92] So yeah, apparently we've got that linked as well. All right. What else do we want to talk about today?
[2590.92 → 2597.16] We've got some other good stuff in here. Ah, yes. Intel replaces Bob Swan, the Dominator, the Swanee Swan
[2598.20 → 2603.32] with legendary former engineer Pat Gelsinger. This was posted by Anthony in the chat. Luke,
[2603.32 → 2610.20] do you want to give us the low down? Yeah, well, I don't know if you can pin it all on him, but
[2610.20 → 2617.80] uh, ever since Mr. Bob took over things have not exactly been going well, uh, in the Intel department.
[2617.80 → 2623.40] In fairness, I mean, he was only CEO for like a year and like, or a year and a half or something
[2623.40 → 2628.76] like that. I can't remember the exact period, but like not all its kind of like when, uh, when a new
[2628.76 → 2634.12] GM takes over a hockey team. Yeah. It's kind of like when a new GM takes over a hockey team.
[2634.12 → 2637.96] You can't blame them for anything that happens in the first couple of years, really. Yeah.
[2637.96 → 2642.92] So, but go on, go on. And he was kind of thrown into that position if I remember correctly, because
[2643.48 → 2650.20] uh, he was like acting CEO after the last one just like vanished. Um, so like, I don't even think it
[2650.20 → 2654.76] was necessarily intended, and it just seemed like they, they were going to replace him for like six
[2654.76 → 2660.60] or seven months, and then they just didn't. And he became the CEO. So like, uh, and he wasn't really
[2660.60 → 2664.28] there for a super long time. And a lot of these things that they're working on are going to be set in
[2664.28 → 2669.16] motion way in the past. So like I said, I don't know how much you can actually blame it on him,
[2669.16 → 2676.68] but things were not great during his reign. And one of the constant criticisms from way back up until
[2676.68 → 2684.20] current, um, has been that Intel should probably be led by an engineer, not a business person.
[2684.20 → 2691.64] And Bob Swan's background is business, not engineering. Um, and Pat Gelsinger, his background
[2691.64 → 2698.84] is definitely engineering. So, um, I, I, this isn't necessarily a dig at, at Bob, but I think people
[2698.84 → 2707.40] are excited about Pat regardless. Um, can I just say how much I love this note here? So, um, Pat previously
[2707.40 → 2714.44] served as VMware CEO and Intel CEO before that, uh, has background or CTO, excuse me, has a background
[2714.44 → 2720.28] in electronics engineering. And when was first recruited out of high school by Intel in 1979,
[2720.28 → 2725.96] the recruiter's notes said, allegedly smart, arrogant, aggressive, he'll fit right in.
[2728.44 → 2733.24] It was pretty good. Remember, remember when Intel was smart and aggressive, still arrogant,
[2733.24 → 2736.92] but remember when they also had the smarts and the aggressiveness to back it up?
[2737.80 → 2746.20] I would love to see a return to that. Like, here we go. Here we go. Just to clarify as well. Um,
[2746.20 → 2752.36] he is, he's not necessarily a jerk. Uh, he does donate 50% of his gross income to charities,
[2752.36 → 2755.48] helping improper children go to school. That's pretty cool. That's pretty sweet.
[2755.48 → 2759.24] He may be aggressive, maybe competitively or something like that, but he seems to be a
[2759.24 → 2766.84] at least decently nice guy. And some major, some major accomplishments during his 30 years at Intel,
[2766.84 → 2772.76] uh, worked on Intel's 286 and 386. Those were pretty popular products. If I recall correctly,
[2772.76 → 2778.76] was the lead architect of the 486 at the tender age of 25 years old, ran the division that produced
[2778.76 → 2784.28] the Pentium pro and launched the Intel developer forum. Oh, really? Oh, that's pretty cool. So the
[2784.28 → 2789.72] changeover is scheduled to take place on February 15th. And all I have to say about this is fight,
[2789.72 → 2797.40] fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. Like I'm, I'm excited. And like we just said about
[2797.40 → 2803.40] Bob though, it is likely going to take a while for this to, to actually have any like major noticeable
[2803.40 → 2809.72] impact. So, I mean, it's not like Lisa Sue took over AMD and like the next day they were able to,
[2809.72 → 2814.60] you know, she just whipped up a CPU in her kitchen and pulled it out of the oven Jensen style. You
[2814.60 → 2819.48] know what I'm talking about? Like, it's not like, it doesn't work like that. Yeah. Her oven isn't
[2819.48 → 2823.72] that expensive. I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, his oven, man, have you seen, have you seen the
[2823.72 → 2832.76] spatulas that man has? I mean, if I had spatulas like that, I could, I could make GPUs and CPUs. No problem.
[2832.76 → 2837.40] Yeah. Just melt the spatulas down. Got enough materials. I, uh, yeah, it's exciting.
[2837.40 → 2840.36] Silicon and Silicon are not the same thing. We've been through this, Luke.
[2840.36 → 2844.04] I'm messing around. I'm messing around. I know you are. Furthermore, I know you are. Um,
[2844.04 → 2849.88] but yeah, it's, it's, it's exciting. I just, yeah. My one note would be that, uh, don't hold out for,
[2849.88 → 2855.08] for any news in the like near future. I expect anything exciting would be fairly down the line,
[2855.08 → 2860.44] but it's pretty cool regardless. Yeah. I'm excited. Something a lot of people have been asking for,
[2860.44 → 2866.44] for a long time, and it's actually happening. So exactly. All right. Oh, oh,
[2866.44 → 2871.00] we're finally going to talk about this. Okay. We are launching. Wait, hey,
[2871.00 → 2872.68] Vaughn, do you have the things I'm supposed to sign?
[2876.12 → 2881.64] I don't know what that is. Uh, may I have it please?
[2882.52 → 2888.52] Yvonne's going to get it for me. Thank you. Okay. Uh, I have no idea how this is supposed to work.
[2889.40 → 2895.80] Um, I, I just, well, we don't have a lot of them, so there's a whole, there's a whole thing, right?
[2897.72 → 2901.16] Okay. There it is. Never mind. Okay. I got it. I've got it.
[2902.44 → 2911.80] Oh my God. The limited edition pink Lamb beanie is for sale. Now this is a very expensive beanie or
[2911.80 → 2918.44] toque. And I'm going to be completely honest with you guys. It is exactly the same toque
[2918.44 → 2925.24] as the one I'm wearing. Okay. I'm look, look, look, I'm being honest. Okay. Like I said,
[2925.24 → 2933.16] with the toe cutter offer device, as long as wait, what people crawled the site and looked in all
[2933.16 → 2937.24] products and there's only like 20 left. Okay. So move fast. If you want one guys, um,
[2937.24 → 2942.84] it's exactly the same product. It is as advertised though. I'm being honest with you guys. Okay.
[2943.32 → 2948.28] And so in order to differentiate it, Oh, Nick says it's a slightly different. It's slightly different.
[2948.28 → 2952.44] It's a hundred percent acrylic fabric instead of an acrylic wool blend. Uh, but if honest,
[2952.44 → 2956.44] it feels the same, it feels like the same damn thing. So here they are
[2959.48 → 2965.48] with your beanie that you paid way too much money for because the regular ones like 20 bucks or
[2965.48 → 2974.92] something you will get this Linus tech tips, Lamb beanie certificate of authenticity numbered one to
[2974.92 → 2982.76] 69. So it says, this is, this is one of 69 Lamb beanies. Nice. And then I believe you will also get
[2983.56 → 2993.64] a Lamb foil sticker. Yeah. Uh, Lamb foil sticker. Apparently they're gone. So there you go. Thanks for,
[2993.64 → 2998.20] thanks for playing guys. So maybe we'll do an after party stream tonight. Would that be okay, Vaughn?
[2999.80 → 3005.80] I don't know. Maybe we'll do an after party stream tonight. Now I will sign them. I will sign all 69 of them, uh,
[3005.80 → 3011.00] in, in front of you guys. So you'll, you'll know that it's legit. And also that we didn't do more than,
[3011.00 → 3016.36] more than 69 of them because that would be, that would be, man, what a scam that would be. If I was like, yeah,
[3016.36 → 3020.36] we're only doing 69 of them. And actually we do like a thousand and there's like duplicates.
[3021.16 → 3027.88] Hmm. Wait, you could do 69,000. I'm kidding. We only made like, I think we made 969. Sorry.
[3027.88 → 3032.92] I think we made like 70 so that if like one of them is gets lost in the mail or something like that,
[3032.92 → 3038.84] we have a little bit. Yeah. It makes sense. Yeah. So, so they're all gone. It looks cool. I actually
[3038.84 → 3042.76] like the like watermelon type of like, it actually looks pretty. All right.
[3042.76 → 3047.72] I legitimately like it. Like some of the photos with it on people, like it, it looks good. Yep.
[3047.72 → 3053.00] So we actually went to the trouble of doing a whole photo shoot for a product that we're going to sell
[3053.00 → 3061.40] less than a hundred of, but whatever. Actually we have another limited edition product. So these are,
[3061.40 → 3065.40] these are just kind of honestly, they're not big moneymakers, but they're, they're kind of fun to do.
[3065.40 → 3069.88] There's a video coming out. People who are on float plane are going to know about this already,
[3069.88 → 3075.08] but there's a video coming out where we do Dennis's people in chatter, like paper launch.
[3076.68 → 3083.64] I told you guys, I was honest with you guys. We only did a few of them. Okay. Okay. So this one,
[3084.28 → 3090.92] we're only doing a hundred of these and float plane people are going to get it already, but it's a shirt.
[3090.92 → 3099.88] Okay. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Live laugh. Yeah. Did you watch the did you watch the video?
[3099.88 → 3107.56] Yes. That's great. Yeah. So Dennis spoiler alert, Dennis, as part of his Intel home setup,
[3107.56 → 3118.52] extreme rig upgrade, whatever we call it as part of his video, he spent like $400 of his budget on a faux neon sign
[3119.32 → 3125.80] to go behind his setup that says live, laugh, Liao. And I was like, what?
[3128.44 → 3133.08] How did you, how did you spend this much money on this?
[3136.60 → 3144.52] So anyway, people started immediately demanding a shirt. So we've got a hundred units. We'll have a hundred
[3144.52 → 3151.00] units. It's going to go live when the, when the video goes up, uh, Sunday or something.
[3151.88 → 3155.24] Every limited edition product should be $69 and 69 cents.
[3155.88 → 3159.80] I mean, we could until there's one that costs us more than that to make.
[3160.84 → 3162.04] Then it could be $690.
[3164.12 → 3167.08] We could do that. We could do that. I could, I could, I could make a lot of things.
[3167.08 → 3174.44] I could make a lot of things fit in that price point. $690. Anyway. All right. Sorry. So that's,
[3174.44 → 3179.16] that's all the that's all the Memling for LTT store. Oh, also the great crew next set of sweaters
[3179.16 → 3187.80] are finally back in stock. These also sold out basically immediately. And, uh, we, we grossly
[3187.80 → 3193.48] underestimated how many of them we were going to sell. Uh, it's got the zippered. See, you've got
[3193.48 → 3203.08] these like stealthy zippered pockets. It's super comfy. Um, lots of different sizes. That's, that's kind
[3203.08 → 3207.48] of an uncomfortable looking picture. You know what? Let's not, let's not look at that for too long.
[3208.36 → 3213.48] All right. Sorry. Now for real, I'm done. Google purchases Fitbit. This was posted by LexisGamer05
[3213.48 → 3217.88] on the forum. After a year of EU regulators scrutinizing the deal, Google has completed
[3217.88 → 3224.68] its acquisition of Fitbit for $2.1 billion. Google hardware chief says the acquisition is about devices,
[3224.68 → 3229.64] not data. Interestingly, the U S department of justice has not approved the deal, but I don't think
[3229.64 → 3232.92] the U S government is doing a lot of much of anything right now while they wait
[3232.92 → 3239.00] for the transition. So yeah. Uh, yeah. Google says the waiting period for their investigation expired.
[3239.96 → 3244.92] That's pretty funny. Um, the DOJ though says that Google is still under investigation for
[3244.92 → 3249.40] antitrust regarding the deal. So we'll see if they can kind of resolve that between the two of them.
[3249.96 → 3255.64] This is why I was saying in the intro, like, yeah, they, they bought Fitbit sort of is like, yes,
[3255.64 → 3261.88] they did, but we'll see what ends up being reality. The approval from the EU did come with some
[3261.88 → 3267.00] conditions, including that Google cannot use Fitbit data such as health, wellness, or GPS for targeting
[3267.00 → 3274.20] ads. It's like, Hey Google. Yes, you can have it, but only if you like, don't use it. Um, users must also
[3274.20 → 3278.92] be able to opt out of sharing Fitbit data with other Google apps and apps and services. So this sounds,
[3279.80 → 3283.80] I don't know. What do you think? Is Android Wear going to stop being terrible?
[3283.80 → 3294.28] Honestly, I don't really think so. Um, is, is Fitbit's experience better than Apple Watch?
[3296.44 → 3304.04] I will be honest with you. I have never, I have never been inclined in any way to use a Fitbit.
[3305.48 → 3309.80] So there you go. Maybe I should, maybe I should give it a crack. Maybe I should give it a shot.
[3309.80 → 3315.88] Oh, I think Nick is watching right now. Yo, Nick, uh, we've got people asking about Swacked. They're
[3315.88 → 3321.80] like, Hey, are you guys ever going to do another run of that? Like sweet, like racing jacket thing.
[3322.52 → 3328.92] We are working on V2. I do have some concept artwork. If Nick approves it, I would be happy to
[3328.92 → 3333.80] share some of it with you, but it's possible he will not allow me to show it to you because he likes
[3333.80 → 3338.20] to keep things all secret. He's a control freak like that. Control freak.
[3340.84 → 3346.28] Samsung announces, Samsung announces upcycling it while working with me, you know,
[3346.84 → 3351.96] things probably feel very chaotic. You have to, you do feel like you have to control something.
[3351.96 → 3359.00] Yeah. That too. Yeah. It's like you, you work with an actual tornado. He's sending me so many
[3359.00 → 3365.80] messages right now. I got a mute teams on my computer here. Um, he says, he says, do whatever
[3365.80 → 3369.64] you want. I don't have it though. I don't have it. Furthermore, I can't find it in my email. So you have to,
[3369.64 → 3374.92] you have to, you have to send me whatever I can show Nick. All right. Samsung announces upcycling at home
[3374.92 → 3381.48] to repurpose old devices. So this was during their CES 2021 event on Monday. This was posted by random
[3381.48 → 3387.40] HK kid on the forums. They announced a number of new devices and new ways to use old ones. So older
[3387.40 → 3391.72] phones that may be still perfectly usable, but are no longer supported or useful as a smartphone can
[3391.72 → 3397.16] be repurposed as things like baby monitors, ambient light sensors. That's an overkill ambient light
[3397.16 → 3403.88] sensor, long distance smart home control. That is a perfect idea. Uh, what I would, what I hope
[3404.52 → 3409.00] that they are doing with their smart things ecosystem. So it's like an if this, then that style
[3409.00 → 3419.64] interface, apparently what I hope they're doing is they are, um, that they are helping avoid the devices,
[3419.64 → 3425.48] uh, becoming damaged by this kind of use case. Like I remember we were using old phones as like
[3425.48 → 3430.04] two factor authenticator devices and having them plugged in all the time basically meant we were
[3430.04 → 3435.40] cycling through batteries. Like what every six months on when we had like an old phone as the two
[3435.40 → 3441.24] factor, like how often were the batteries dying in them? It was like on a it was over a span of months
[3441.24 → 3445.16] not years. So if you were going to use something like this as a baby monitor, the last thing you
[3445.16 → 3448.84] want is to have it plugged in all the time and then have that turn into a bulging battery, and you've got
[3448.84 → 3453.80] like a fire hazard in your nursery. So I hope they've given that some thought and YouTube comments were
[3453.80 → 3459.64] quick to point out that just giving them longer official software support would also reduce waste if the
[3459.64 → 3468.28] thing just like worked. Uh, remember too though that Samsung is not the only, um, they're not the only
[3468.28 → 3473.96] player when it comes to ensuring that there is driver support for the hardware. They are a key player,
[3473.96 → 3479.00] but they are not the only one to make sure that they continue to roll software updates.
[3481.96 → 3488.28] Um, also Racer debuts Project Hazel. I'm going to bring this up on screen. Luke, you want to,
[3488.28 → 3493.96] you want to talk through this thing? Which one is this? Is this that? Yeah. So this is their mask. Um,
[3495.72 → 3501.24] I don't know for this one genuinely, but I will say Racer does have a bit of a track record of
[3501.24 → 3507.08] announcing things at CES that definitely never see the light of day. Um, I could see this seeing the
[3507.08 → 3516.12] light of day, but yeah. Um, they's, it's a smart mask. It has these like RGB active filters on the side.
[3516.12 → 3521.24] Uh, yeah. It says the mask concept is not for sale, but claims to have patent pending voice
[3521.24 → 3526.76] amplification technology. Kind of neat. Uh, the mass transparent design allows people to see the
[3526.76 → 3533.16] wearer's face, which is a maybe good and bad thing depending on, uh, what your opinion on that is.
[3533.16 → 3535.72] I found it a lot easier to yawn during meetings lately.
[3535.72 → 3544.52] The, uh, the lights inside the mask activate automatically in the dark. Um, the Racer
[3544.52 → 3549.72] Chroma RGB is also making an appearance on the two lighting zones on the, uh, active filters. Like
[3549.72 → 3555.80] I mentioned earlier, uh, there's a wireless charging box that sanitizes the mask with UV light, which
[3555.80 → 3563.24] I believe would actually theoretically work from my understanding. Um, and as an aside earlier in the
[3563.24 → 3568.84] coronavirus pandemic, Racer converted manufacturing facilities in China to make face masks, which is
[3568.84 → 3573.00] pretty neat to date. They have distributed over a million masks globally. Very cool.
[3573.00 → 3578.76] Good for them. Thanks. Um, I have actually been quite surprised that there hasn't been more,
[3581.08 → 3585.24] more substantial efforts to make fashion masks, to be honest.
[3585.24 → 3591.16] I mean, didn't like one of the really, really high fashion brands do it. I think a few of the like
[3591.16 → 3595.64] Gucci's of the world have made them. Yeah. Didn't like Louis Vuitton do one or something like that.
[3595.64 → 3601.08] And it was like a thousand dollars or something. Probably. But like, I just, I mean, from, from like
[3601.08 → 3606.44] more reasonable companies. Uh, but I think that's probably because most of the goal of the mask
[3606.44 → 3614.12] manufacturers have just been volume, um, not style. So yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. It looks
[3614.12 → 3620.20] cool. I don't think I necessarily want one, but it definitely has the cool factor going on.
[3620.20 → 3624.60] I would guess it's going to be like 250 us dollars though. Just like looking at it and knowing Racer,
[3624.60 → 3632.52] like I don't think it'll be cheap. Nice that itself sanitizes. Yeah. I wonder how they avoid it
[3632.52 → 3638.84] from fogging up like immediately. I know there are different methods that they can do. And those, um,
[3638.84 → 3646.04] um, active ventilators probably help with that, but still like, wow. Yeah. It looks cool though.
[3646.04 → 3650.52] Every, every shot that they have with someone wearing it, it like looks pretty cool. It kind of
[3650.52 → 3656.68] does. Speaking of things that look cool when people wear them. Haha. Thanks for keying me up like that.
[3656.68 → 3664.92] So this is an early mockup of Stack It V2. Um, and it's not really in focus, but whatever you guys,
[3664.92 → 3668.92] you guys get the point, you're kind of looking at my lights here. Uh, we might end up with a little
[3668.92 → 3673.80] bit more in terms of like colour accents, but it is going to be stealthier. It is still going to be
[3673.80 → 3679.48] made out of like kind of a heavier material instead of the regular reflective tape. It's probably going
[3679.48 → 3686.04] to have like a dark or black, but reflective tape. Um, we've got some, yeah, we've got some really,
[3686.04 → 3693.80] really cool stuff coming up and that's, that's one of them. Um, yeah, excite, very excite. All right.
[3693.80 → 3700.04] I think that's pretty much it for topics for today. So there are a couple super chats that I did want
[3700.04 → 3707.16] to read. Um, in spite of like me thinking it doesn't make sense to do super chats. Uh, Buddy Scotch asks,
[3707.16 → 3712.04] uh, will you please do an LGR collab after the pandemic? I don't see why not. I'd love to,
[3712.04 → 3717.80] uh, we'd love to, we'd love to bring LGR up for, uh, LTX the next time we like can actually do it. So if
[3717.80 → 3725.80] do it, so if nothing else, we should, we should meet there. Um, Ritz Blitz says Linus tumbling
[3725.80 → 3730.28] tips when as a semi-athletic person who manages to publicly humiliate themselves regularly. Thanks
[3730.28 → 3734.92] for the laughs with you, not at you. Thanks for that. Cedric says after raid shadow legends,
[3734.92 → 3739.24] I would bet this stream is sponsored by an online casino. JK just bought a water bottle and LTT
[3739.24 → 3746.36] store. Hey, thanks Cedric. Um, T wolf says we love you, Linus and Luke. You all good in my book.
[3746.36 → 3753.64] Uh, yeah, aggressive advertising blows, but it is what it is. Meh. People just going to hate.
[3754.92 → 3758.76] Uh, no, I don't think it's just hate. I mean, I, I want to understand people's,
[3758.76 → 3767.08] I want to understand people's upset, you know? Um, the gaming sir says as one of the people who
[3767.08 → 3771.96] complained about the sponsor, please accept this compensation, 20 us dollars, so that I hope to
[3771.96 → 3777.48] never see raid shadow legends ever again. Also, no Facebook or Oculus ever again. Okay. Thanks.
[3778.12 → 3784.52] Okay. It's not quite that simple. Um, but what do you mean?
[3786.20 → 3791.00] Duly noted. Your request has been logged. Andrew Trumpeter says with tech link doing five videos
[3791.00 → 3795.00] a week, what would you say is the limiting factor for having tech link being five videos every week?
[3795.00 → 3799.24] Uh, the limiting factor is tech news. Um, that's honestly it like back when they used to
[3799.24 → 3804.84] new net linked daily because they used to, uh, they found that a lot of the time it was,
[3804.84 → 3809.24] they were scraping the bottom of the barrel in order to force themselves to do it every day.
[3809.24 → 3814.44] And if you just do it kind of when there's enough tech news, uh, it's easy to get lazy because it's
[3814.44 → 3819.32] so much work to figure out if there's enough tech news that by the time you've done it, it's like,
[3819.32 → 3824.04] okay, well I might as well make a video about it. Or if you like to have a gut feeling, there's not enough
[3824.04 → 3826.84] tech news today, you might as well just not do all that pre-work. So it's like, no,
[3826.84 → 3831.72] you have to commit to a production schedule. And so three times a week has ended up being
[3831.72 → 3839.72] about right. We very rarely feel like we're, we're forcing it, you know? Um, sir, really,
[3839.72 → 3843.40] Sam says, I remember having to persuade people to buy enough of the Highlander t-shirts on the
[3843.40 → 3847.88] forum seven years ago so we could get enough people to make it worth printing. Now things sell
[3847.88 → 3853.64] instantly on stream. Yeah, it's a little different. It's a little different. And JD McCoy says,
[3853.64 → 3857.96] Hey Linus, anyone ever told you your name is the wrong way around? It should be Sebastian Linus.
[3858.68 → 3864.92] Um, okay. But it's not, uh, well, no, because Linus is also a first name. They're just both first names.
[3864.92 → 3869.48] So I don't know. Long story. Imagine telling someone their names wrong.
[3869.48 → 3875.64] Yeah. Yeah. Like, like your name, Lucas. It's wrong for someone to just be named Luke.
[3876.44 → 3878.84] Luke is short for Lucas. You heard me.
[3878.84 → 3886.04] So rude. Yeah. Well, it should also be L-U-C. Because my last name is French and I have an English first name.
[3886.04 → 3888.52] So like, who knows?
[3888.52 → 3889.24] Who knows?
[3890.68 → 3893.32] That was more Italian, I guess. All right. Thanks for watching, guys.
[3893.32 → 3894.52] I'm happy as an artist weekly.
[3894.52 → 3898.04] We will see you again next week. Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3898.92 → 3899.24] Bye!
[3900.44 → 3901.08] It's like your cat's face.
[3901.08 → 3902.76] Update Dell. Dell update.
[3902.76 → 3904.92] I don't have one for you. I haven't heard back. Okay, bye.
[3904.92 → 3905.96] Okay. Bye.
[3908.36 → 3911.48] Oh, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We got an important super chat.
[3911.48 → 3913.08] Happy birthday, Cooper. See you later.
[3918.52 → 3929.96] I don't know.
[3929.96 → 3934.36] Psychotog says, OMG, it's not your fault, but braces trigger me.
