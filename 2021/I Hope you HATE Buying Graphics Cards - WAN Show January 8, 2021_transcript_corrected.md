[0.00 → 6.72] that's not what I meant to do at all okay oh bollocks sorry I'm moving you a little bit
[6.72 → 14.48] because you're actually a little bit too high oh shoot has it started it's starting
[15.92 → 21.52] welcome to the man show ladies and gentlemen we have got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[21.52 → 26.16] and hope that you enjoy it and i when I say hope I mean hope because
[26.16 → 32.32] like I don't have anything objective that would make me think that you're going to enjoy any of
[32.32 → 40.40] this it's all bad it's all bad news today people enjoy bad news though sometimes NVIDIA RTX 3080 max
[40.40 → 51.92] q could be 74 slower than a desktop version of the same card that is that would put it in line not
[51.92 → 60.88] with last gen's flagship but the one before that in other news GPUs the desktop kind that is highly
[60.88 → 67.28] performant are about to get much more expensive thanks to Trump administration tariffs womp
[68.56 → 76.72] just, just one more hey how you're doing on the way out what else we got Luke it was only a matter of time
[76.72 → 81.52] we saw it sort of happen with oculus, and now we're seeing it happen with whatsapp is going to
[81.52 → 89.28] start compulsory information sharing with Facebook and also there's a rumour that some switch dodders
[89.28 → 96.88] found evidence of a switch pro coming up which will be able to do 4k in docked mode 4k in docked mode
[96.88 → 103.36] wow what I want to know is where's 120 hertz in docked mode, and you know what else I want to know
[103.36 → 108.72] where's the intro where's it at oh yes oh wait oh, oh it's actually not working
[108.72 → 118.48] oh that's awkward um uh oh geez oh geez Luke uh am I the one that does the squeeze i
[118.48 → 122.96] actually don't remember that's insane how many times have I watched this we're good we're good
[122.96 → 129.76] we're good we're good we're good cool nice all right I found it the intro is missing carmen San Diego
[129.76 → 146.24] I don't think my children are a lover know like what the heck a carmen San Diego is where in the
[146.24 → 153.60] world is carmen San Diego okay you're probably too young to know the TV show though I think I played a
[153.60 → 160.88] game yeah yeah yeah the game is like the OG like carmen San Diego ness, but there was a TV show it was
[160.88 → 169.04] like if I recall correctly it was like a cheesy kind of game show type thing but like for kids
[169.68 → 175.12] so instead of like having like a daily double like jeopardy thing you would like to find clues or something
[175.12 → 182.80] i I honestly have almost no memories of it I just remember the phrase of where in the world is
[182.80 → 189.04] carmen San Diego and I remember her like running away from someone and that's it that's all I remember
[189.04 → 195.36] it was so long ago whoa I played it at my like cousin's house there is a currently running
[195.36 → 206.32] carmen San Diego TV series on Netflix it's animated what what what timeline am I on it's just bringing
[206.32 → 214.32] everything back like honestly though what is even going on right now that is hilarious yeah you know
[214.32 → 220.72] apparently Netflix is doing an Elder Scrolls TV series seriously okay that shouldn't surprise me
[220.72 → 226.80] that much especially 150 million dollar budget per season wow I mean after the success they had with
[226.80 → 231.44] the Witcher that shouldn't be that much of a that shouldn't be that much of a surprise well you know
[231.44 → 236.88] what it looks like I was actually not that far off contestants pursue the international thief as junior
[236.88 → 242.72] detectives who must answer questions about geography yeah okay so that's like that's kind of is that
[242.72 → 247.36] kind of what I said I think maybe yeah somewhat yeah it was a children's game show all right there you go
[247.36 → 254.88] oh man these reviews these are amazing uh user review PBS is best it was a children's game show
[254.88 → 261.20] I used to love to watch when I came home from school along with wishbone yeah you don't know wishbone
[261.20 → 267.04] ah forget it whatever i I remember I didn't I didn't watch TV much we had like the three channel
[267.04 → 273.92] rabbit ear thing I just would rather do other stuff yeah i i knew wishbone I only got to watch
[273.92 → 278.40] it a couple of times, but it was like it was a cute uh it was a cute dog that like solved mysteries or
[278.40 → 284.40] something it's like right that was that is some 90s that is some classic 90s TV programming if I've
[284.40 → 292.16] ever heard of it why don't we jump right into our headline topic for the day which is GPUs to become
[292.16 → 298.96] more expensive due to Trump administration tariffs so these tariffs are not actually new sorry okay no
[298.96 → 304.80] what no, no no, no no Luke's going to say more words this one show Luke go ahead hold on this wasn't the
[304.80 → 311.60] headline topic yeah it wasn't it no it was the 74 slower well they're there but I mean the topic
[311.60 → 318.48] the headline topic is I hope you hate buying graphics cards because they're both terrible um okay, okay so
[318.48 → 326.48] due to import tariffs imposed in the US the price of GPUs and motherboards will be increased by 7.5 to 25
[326.48 → 335.12] oh which is freaking huge SSD's cases and power supplies that output more than 500 watts are also
[335.12 → 346.88] affected so anything the MSRP of the RTX 3080 is expected to go from 699 to 874 if you're able to actually
[346.88 → 351.44] buy one anyway I mean this might make it easier to get one except that didn't bitcoin just hit like
[351.44 → 359.12] 40 000 us and aren't miners like a big heavy thing right now again yeah so it's probably going to be
[359.12 → 364.08] just as hard i I literally suspect it'll just scale the scalp prices will just go up by that much
[364.72 → 368.96] and MSRP is just going to go up by that much and everyone's still not going to be able to get them
[369.44 → 374.08] it's going to be just as bad as it used to be Asus has confirmed it needs to raise GPU and
[374.08 → 381.04] motherboard prices while basically every other company is doing it more silently so big rip um in
[381.04 → 386.56] 2018 the Trump administration increased import tariffs but due to uh your things blocking the
[386.56 → 394.40] thing but due to pushback of oh it's blocking due to pushback specific goods fell under exemptions and
[394.40 → 401.28] basically uh over the last little while um the Trump administration has just kind of like been busy
[402.16 → 408.64] trying to stay the Trump administration and have not really like paid attention to certain things so
[410.48 → 417.68] yep the exemptions have expired and as of January 1st prices on your precious pc hardware goods
[417.68 → 426.00] are going way up, but that's not the whole story yes prices are also probably going up due to things
[426.00 → 431.68] like increased shipping costs with covet going on everything you could possibly imagine
[431.68 → 437.36] is focusing on shipping lately, so shipping is getting more and more expensive as uh companies
[437.36 → 443.28] are becoming more and more utilized vaccines got to move around that too oh my goodness I didn't even
[443.28 → 449.52] think about that um, but yeah things need to be shipped everywhere and there are tariffs and those things are
[449.52 → 453.84] not mutually exclusive so they're both going to apply at the same time and prices are going to
[453.84 → 460.32] go up up it is possible that the Biden administration will reverse those tariffs um but
[460.32 → 465.12] there's probably going to be a lot of other stuff they're going to have to do uh immediately after
[465.12 → 473.60] taking office so that being a notable priority is unlikely I would suspect can I take a moment to um
[473.60 → 483.44] kind of have a little bit of fun amidst this okay, okay so um I'm Canadian you're Canadian too we can both be
[483.44 → 490.24] Canadian is yeah we're both we're both fairly Canadian um yeah I'm also fairly not but yeah it's complicated
[490.24 → 499.20] it's complicated relationship status it's complicated um and usually in Canada we have much higher prices
[500.08 → 507.60] on computer hardware than you guys do in America interesting but because of a top secret project that
[507.60 → 514.00] I'm working on I actually was having a conversation with a hardware manufacturer quite recently about
[514.00 → 522.72] what my pricing would be on like GPUs or CPUs or whatever the case may be nothing to do with mining
[522.72 → 527.84] just to clarify it's actually the opposite of that Luke you know about the secret project can you confirm
[527.84 → 533.44] yes, yes i I will fully confirm it is the polar opposite of mining but I did have to have a conversation
[533.44 → 540.16] about you know what wholesale prices would be from a manufacturer, and it was confirmed to me that
[540.16 → 547.44] if I'm in Canada, and they ship it to Canada my price is as much as 25 less and when you combine that
[547.44 → 553.20] with the fact that the Canadian dollar has been on an absolute tear over the last six months for the
[553.20 → 563.92] first time since I think 2000 I want to say like 2008 the 2008 financial crisis computer hardware will
[563.92 → 572.80] be cheaper on a like dollars to dollars basis in Canada than in the USA that's pretty wild actually
[572.80 → 582.08] if you shipped a card like how even if how do these tear like if even is you were an individual
[582.08 → 588.08] like if an individual in Canada bought a card in Canada yes and then like shipped it to a friend
[588.08 → 595.44] to their friend would be on the hook for the import tariffs and if their Canadian friend
[595.44 → 600.24] was trying to be a nice guy there eh and uh didn't fill out the paperwork correctly there bud
[600.24 → 607.92] um the issue is that that's like uh fraud or whatever so yeah so that's bad so you don't want to do
[607.92 → 612.40] that you want to actually fill out all the import documentation correctly so that is something i
[612.40 → 618.72] actually did ask I was like hey manufacturer so how does it work if you know I wanted to help out
[618.72 → 625.04] some American friends, and they're like oh it's on you so I was like yeah it's kind of what I thought
[625.68 → 630.24] so that's the way that's the way it works um there's a lot of speculation going on in the chat you
[630.24 → 635.52] guys will not figure out what the top secret project is don't even bother trying we are not becoming
[635.52 → 640.56] a system integrator that's not happening uh i I want nothing to do with that business I've made
[640.56 → 647.60] that very clear many times in the past I was going to say for years yeah but i just yeah i I'm not I'm not
[647.60 → 654.00] gloating or anything I'm just making an interesting observation to be clear I'm not happy about it
[654.00 → 660.56] it's not like we're winning you guys are just losing this is a game with no winners yeah your situation
[660.56 → 666.24] did not improve you just fell further behind exactly like what i I would love for her, you know
[666.24 → 671.68] our buying power to just have caught up, but that's not what happened uh yours just fell behind now in
[671.68 → 679.52] theory the point of these tariffs is to increase U.S. jobs, but the problem is that when it comes to
[679.52 → 687.52] the production of computer components and electronics there's no meaningful way to do that with the
[687.52 → 693.68] in the grand scheme of things negligible amount of money that the government will be collecting
[693.68 → 699.52] on these tariffs and if you want to see you know how well it works to try to bring high-tech
[699.52 → 706.80] manufacturing to the U.S. and I don't mean like uh you know uh microprocessor manufacturing that's
[706.80 → 712.56] already there I'm talking like you know like motherboards and displays and stuff like that if you
[712.56 → 717.04] want to see how successful that's likely to be just have a look at that Foxconn project that
[718.40 → 724.32] is like basically a ghost factory as far as anyone can tell Foxconn factory what is it in like
[724.32 → 733.44] Wisconsin or something uh man that is like that is a fascinating that is a fascinating rabbit hole
[733.44 → 740.00] well there's new stuff this is amazing article from December 18th this is less than a month ago
[740.00 → 750.08] Foxconn tells Wisconsin it never promised to build an LCD factory what there was like
[750.08 → 758.88] literally a groundbreaking ceremony and stuff and uh that's hilarious yeah it's been like a whole thing
[759.52 → 766.16] uh oh this is from December 8th they demolished my house for these residents outraged by the Foxconn
[766.16 → 771.52] factory that fizzled yeah like the thing is it's not as simple as just well we need to put the
[771.52 → 775.60] building there, and we need to put the equipment there, and you need to hire us workers and put them
[775.60 → 783.20] in there because there's a whole supply chain around building electronics that just doesn't exist in
[783.20 → 791.52] North America anymore so it would take years and years and years to build up that kind of
[791.52 → 798.00] manufacturing centre it would have to be coastal because even in China a lot of the materials for
[798.00 → 804.40] that kind of manufacturing are imported and I don't know where the heck you'd put that there
[804.40 → 810.08] it'd be an environmental disaster like I don't know how you'd ever get it off the ground and the cost
[810.08 → 815.36] would be way higher like it's just it's not feasible there's a reason that people have tried
[815.36 → 821.20] to do it, and it hasn't worked because the only way electronics are as cheap as they are is that there's
[824.08 → 829.52] basically a lot of corners that have been cut in order to make them that way knowing that nothing
[829.52 → 836.80] ever happened to it uh makes this groundbreaking picture oh isn't it hilarious amazing
[836.80 → 843.68] uh here yeah let me bring it let me bring it up to the stream here but knowing that it probably still
[843.68 → 850.48] kind of looks like that if no uh tractors or people were no, no they did like build stuff it's okay there
[850.48 → 854.32] it's just hiring anybody oh man it is an amazing rabbit hole because they like
[855.20 → 860.64] put up a bunch of job postings and then like hired people and then there are like interviews with
[860.64 → 866.48] these people who were hired by Foxconn to like work in the states, and then they're just like yeah
[866.48 → 871.36] I don't know I quit because no one could tell me what I'm supposed to do all day like I had an office
[871.36 → 877.20] but I had no instructions and no responsibilities like it's like they just had like a head count quota
[877.20 → 885.44] to hit and like it's Foxconn so they just have like that Chinese money so they just apparently don't care like
[885.44 → 892.40] like it it's its just bizarre it is so bizarre anyway here's the here's the ground here's the
[892.40 → 898.40] groundbreaking uh oh wow yeah that facility is definitely a thing oh yeah I've never heard of
[898.40 → 905.20] this before yeah no it's totally a thing so I forget who exactly all of these people are that kind of
[905.20 → 909.44] looks like Paul Ryan but I don't remember him being there so i I don't know I don't know what the deal
[909.44 → 913.92] is with that uh hold on a second here's another picture oh that is Paul Ryan okay so you got Paul
[913.92 → 919.36] Ryan you got the Donald, and then you've got uh this is a Foxconn bigwig of some sort I don't know
[919.36 → 923.84] these are all these are all relatively minor details in the grand scheme of things the point is Foxconn
[925.60 → 932.40] tried um I mean now they're saying they never tried now they're saying oh we never actually
[932.40 → 937.44] we never actually committed to making a display factory, but that was that that was what they said
[937.44 → 944.64] it was going to be um yeah that's that's that's yeah it's its something uh comments on Tom's
[944.64 → 950.72] hardware about the situation are pretty bleak uh loaded axe posts looks like DIY pc gaming is coming
[950.72 → 958.96] to an end prices are already way too high integrated graphics or console anyone uh Xbox Series X and PS5
[958.96 → 964.80] are looking more appealing every day I'm feeling priced out of pc gaming says big dragon and I said it
[964.80 → 970.80] once I'll say it again I miss being able to buy a top tier GPU for about 700 us dollars it all went
[970.80 → 978.64] to before uh once Turing came out actually that that happened a fair bit before that I mean 780ti was
[978.64 → 980.16] how much was a 780ti
[983.60 → 991.52] oh that was 700 there was stuff before that cost more than that like 6800 ultra uh was
[991.52 → 1001.52] oh 500 okay well shows you what I know I could have 8800 8800 ultra was a thousand dollar graphics card
[1002.16 → 1007.28] I am almost 100 all of Asus's graphics cards manufactured in because they I'm looking it up
[1007.28 → 1016.32] right now apparently they have manufacturing in Taiwan Mexico and Czech Republic and china is all of their
[1016.32 → 1021.44] GPUs manufactured in China like this shouldn't affect everything because things that aren't manufactured
[1021.44 → 1028.64] in China yeah, so the vast majority of like board manufacturing is going to probably be done in
[1028.64 → 1033.12] china that doesn't mean that they necessarily make everything there and some of those other places
[1033.12 → 1040.48] might be just making components that are ultimately sent to China for assembly or might utilize um
[1041.04 → 1050.40] components made in China I don't remember the exact details but basically the US is at trade war with
[1050.40 → 1055.28] china that doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon and pc gaming is going to be really expensive
[1055.28 → 1062.72] for a minute here okay in other news um the good news is that if you are if you've been waiting
[1062.72 → 1070.40] for uh you know a new laptop for example um graphics cards I expect this pricing to affect them pretty much
[1070.40 → 1075.84] immediately because with the demand for new GPUs right now pretty much everything's going to be air
[1075.84 → 1083.84] shipped so any shipment that arrives in the US after January 1st is going to be affected, but there are
[1083.84 → 1089.84] other product categories that are more likely to be shipped via ocean that could still have pre-tariff
[1089.84 → 1095.20] stocks sitting on shelves so now might be a good time to pick up a gaming notebook especially if these
[1095.20 → 1103.84] rumours are true this was uh added to the doc by Alex and the rumours and leaks come courtesy of notebook
[1103.84 → 1113.04] check tech power up and video cards and the headline is NVIDIA's RTX 3080 max q could be 74 slower than the
[1113.04 → 1120.40] desktop card I mean if you paid attention to the numbers when we were reviewing the RTX 30 series this
[1120.40 → 1126.16] might not come as a huge surprise to you but if you weren't looking that closely I'll give you kind of
[1126.16 → 1135.04] the cliff's notes compared to the RTX 20 series RTX 30 in spite of the fact that it's built on a smaller
[1135.04 → 1146.08] manufacturing process node is not really significantly faster in terms of performance per watt so yes they're
[1146.08 → 1150.48] a lot faster I shouldn't say not significantly faster not as much as we've become accustomed to
[1150.48 → 1160.16] so yes they are faster, but they are also to an almost proportional degree just bigger heavier power
[1160.16 → 1169.20] hungrier cards um so it's kind of less like a new generation in that sense and more like just buying
[1169.20 → 1175.52] a higher end one, and it seems like NVIDIA I mean bless their hearts as poorly as that turned out for
[1175.52 → 1181.92] everybody NVIDIA took any kinds of efficiency improvements that they got out of uh moving to
[1181.92 → 1186.48] a smaller manufacturing process and took it straight to price blew them under the water yeah you know
[1186.48 → 1192.48] what's hilarious is that after NVIDIA's terrible experience being uh and I mean for that matter
[1192.48 → 1199.04] probably AMD after the terrible experience that they've had being blamed for you know shortages because
[1199.04 → 1204.64] the price is so attractive and everybody wants one we are never going to get an aggressively priced GPU
[1204.64 → 1215.84] ever again because NVIDIA yeah NVIDIA is a company that never forgets okay they never forget and every time
[1215.84 → 1224.08] someone comes up with the brilliant idea of pleasing gamers, or you know uh going really aggressive on
[1224.08 → 1229.60] price to spoil the launch of the new consoles or whatever the motivation was next time that idea gets
[1229.60 → 1236.72] floated around the boardroom table I guarantee you it's going to look kind of like this
[1241.52 → 1241.84] kind of
[1246.16 → 1246.48] oh
[1248.56 → 1253.04] yeah are you showing something yeah the boardroom suggestion meme you know the one right
[1253.04 → 1260.56] okay, okay yeah, yeah nice okay yeah gotcha I like it yeah hey how about we uh you know sell stuff at a
[1260.56 → 1269.28] good price yeah no, no you're done you're out you're out that's gone never happening again so okay what does
[1269.28 → 1277.44] this mean we could be looking at 3080 max q performance in the neighbourhood of a GTX 1080 ti to be
[1277.44 → 1284.16] clear GTX 1080 ti performance in a laptop I mean that's not exactly terrible that's yeah better than
[1284.16 → 1290.40] a kick in the feet the eyes can run like almost everything and at the resolutions most laptop
[1290.40 → 1295.60] screens are going to be running at you're probably going to be fine yeah probably going to have a pretty darn
[1295.60 → 1302.64] good gaming experience as long as you don't try to turn on RTX um, but you know the fact that the RTX 3080
[1302.64 → 1309.36] desktop card had a 320 watt TDP has been a concern for anyone that was hoping for a powerful mobile
[1309.36 → 1318.48] variant so what it feels like is while there may be a 3080 like non-max q so that would be the max p
[1319.12 → 1325.84] even that one is going to be 150 watt so that whole paradigm shift that took place with maxwell which was
[1325.84 → 1334.48] the 900 series cards from NVIDIA where they went from having like the desktop lineup which was up here
[1334.48 → 1341.84] and then the mobile lineup which was like just completely different GPUs uh with 900 series they
[1341.84 → 1348.24] brought them almost to performance parity it was like it was mind-blowing for us at the time because
[1348.24 → 1355.20] in the past you know you're I'm just trying to think of like yeah let's go back to like you know 7 000
[1355.20 → 1363.12] series like the old 7 000 series you know like a 7800 GT in desktop was a completely different
[1363.12 → 1371.52] GPU from a 7800 GT on mobile like the one on mobile would have been like a 7600, and it was just branded
[1371.52 → 1378.80] 7800 so getting this uh sort of branding parity for the GPU even if they were running at slightly different
[1378.80 → 1383.84] clock speeds or at different power envelopes which is what we've seen a lot of lately with max p that's
[1383.84 → 1392.64] max performance and max q which is maximum quietness um max q with like sort of different
[1392.64 → 1398.48] thermal and power envelopes at least it's still the same GPU and that still does appear to be the case
[1398.48 → 1405.84] so these are still similar classes in terms of how many CUBA cores they have no they're not oh I lied
[1405.84 → 1410.24] okay that's no specifically the difference no we're going we're going we're going back to the old way
[1410.24 → 1417.12] oh that's a bummer okay what do we have then Luke it's just lower everything lower performance
[1417.12 → 1423.04] lower CUBA cores it's its a totally intensely different experience to the point where naming
[1423.04 → 1429.92] them a similar thing is kind of egregious um I there's a note in here somewhere I don't remember
[1429.92 → 1437.84] exactly where it was where they hope that they are very clear to consumers about the TGP of the mobile
[1437.84 → 1443.68] graphics cards and I hope that as well because that's not going to happen um it's its not but uh
[1444.48 → 1450.88] not that far in the past we had like pretty close to performance parity between the mobile and the
[1450.88 → 1459.28] desktop cards um, and now we are we have completely thrown that in the garbage uh and that's that's not
[1459.28 → 1467.76] a good thing for consumers I don't actually necessarily think it's that big of a deal in terms of like
[1467.76 → 1472.64] what you're going to be able to do I think the vast majority of mobile gaming experiences will be
[1472.64 → 1479.92] just fine if you're able to get like 1080 ti level of performance but what you're expecting and like
[1479.92 → 1485.76] what you're reading online versus what you're going to get is probably going to be a confusing experience
[1485.76 → 1490.48] for a very large amount of consumers that aren't extremely dialled in yeah so let's go through some of
[1490.48 → 1497.76] these speeds and feeds because they do kind of matter if tech power up is correct the RTX 3080 max q so
[1497.76 → 1504.32] that's the more power efficient model will have an 80 watt TDP so that's total uh what is it thermal
[1504.32 → 1508.88] design power or total design power or whatever it is so basically it's allowed to consume 80 watts
[1509.52 → 1519.04] and it'll be clocked at 780 megahertz base 1245 boosts for reference that boost is less than the base clock of a
[1519.04 → 1528.16] desktop 3080 so desktop 3080 is 1440 base 1710 boost that's yeah it's not off by like 50 or something
[1528.16 → 1535.60] like it's the boost is off by a considerable amount than the base, and it uses the same ga104 GPU so
[1535.60 → 1544.88] it is still the same silicon is but the max q is going to have only 61 044 CUBA cores enabled compared to the
[1544.88 → 1553.44] desktops 8704 so it's more than just 100 yeah it's more than just a clock speed difference so both of
[1553.44 → 1561.68] those things if you drop your CUBA cores by 20 you are basically looking at a 20-ish percent performance
[1561.68 → 1567.52] drop if you drop your clock speed by 20 you are basically looking at like a 20 performance difference
[1567.52 → 1572.88] if you do both of those things they kind of stack like it's its not quite it's not just
[1572.88 → 1578.88] the 40 because of 20 from both it's like it's worse no, no it's its less bad it should be less bad
[1578.88 → 1586.32] than that, but it's its still it's terrible um there's some good news though so the 3080 max p will
[1586.32 → 1594.40] be 150 watts and boost up to 1545 for those who do need more performance but because that's a 150 watt GPU
[1594.40 → 1601.68] you can expect that to only be present in either very thick or very cleverly designed laptops now
[1601.68 → 1608.08] when Luke says that this is a bad thing for consumers he doesn't mean like you know oh it's tragic we're
[1608.08 → 1618.72] going to have fewer fps for our games yeah well no one think of the gamers it's not like that it's just
[1618.72 → 1626.24] that it's bad for consumers when marketing versus reality doesn't have a strong correlation and
[1626.24 → 1631.36] especially when and i i would bring this up too is like I mentioned the like not that long ago
[1631.36 → 1638.80] we found this performance parity between mobile and desktop cards that was uh I would say at least
[1638.80 → 1644.80] rather heavily marketed yes it was absolutely that we have that we have the future is that we have
[1644.80 → 1649.92] accomplished this goal of mobile cards and desktop cards coming together and essentially being the
[1649.92 → 1656.72] same thing that was like it is going to be this way now um was how that communication felt yeah and
[1656.72 → 1664.80] for it to be not that long since then, and now we're in a situation where it's like very, very notable and
[1664.80 → 1669.76] rather intense performance differences is kind of a shame I mean you say not that long, but it's long
[1669.76 → 1678.64] enough that i kind of got used to this being how it was going to be forever is so yeah even
[1678.64 → 1685.12] Jens yeah it would be very easy to accidentally buy the wrong thing like you could buy yeah with that
[1685.12 → 1694.48] okay so there are 10 plus different models at the various different uh frame buffer amounts and uh like
[1694.48 → 1702.16] thermal and power limits 10 plus different models that will be called RTX 3080 mobile with very different
[1702.16 → 1709.36] performance characteristics so you could easily be trying to compare you know this thin and light
[1709.36 → 1715.84] laptop with a RTX 3080 and this super heavy chunky thing with a RTX 3080, and they're the same price
[1715.84 → 1722.08] and think oh well they're well they both have a RTX 3080 I'll just get the one that's like thinner and sexier
[1722.08 → 1727.68] but the difference in performance could be enormous, and it could even get to the point in fact probably
[1727.68 → 1734.96] will where you could have like a chunkier laptop design with a RTX 3070 max p so that's a max
[1734.96 → 1743.12] performance that would be more performant than a thin laptop with a RTX 3080 max q even though the
[1743.12 → 1748.32] thick one is cheaper it could actually be faster with a lower model number so
[1748.32 → 1758.88] I mean it almost it's almost gotten to the point where like it feels like kind of uh kind of how
[1759.60 → 1765.52] you know 80 plus stepped in and was like okay there needs to be like a third party that certifies power
[1765.52 → 1771.04] supplies for their efficiency to be clear 80 plus is not a perfect system oh Geez yeah how the heck would
[1771.04 → 1775.76] you apply that here at all but I see where you're going through I think there will I think there could be
[1775.76 → 1782.80] a way to apply it I think that if is NVIDIA and AMD got in touch with Steve from gamers nexus and
[1782.80 → 1791.12] were like okay design us no I'm serious nexus rating design us yeah design us a nexus
[1791.12 → 1798.16] rating system for how fast the graphics card is for this thing I think something like that could
[1798.16 → 1804.32] actually have a value at this point i know 3d mark exists I'm aware of it, but it's
[1804.32 → 1812.08] it's its it's terrible it's not it doesn't tell us anything really useful just because of the way
[1812.08 → 1818.72] the scores are derived and the fact that they don't really uh correlate to real world performance in
[1818.72 → 1824.48] actual games and I have no idea how you know this certification system could ever get off the ground
[1824.48 → 1830.56] because game developers would have to license their games for use in testing, and you might think oh well
[1830.56 → 1834.56] game developers would love this because it's just extra exposure for their game why would they ever
[1834.56 → 1842.08] say no but I had the most bizarre experience not ever because I've seen a lot of bizarre stuff being in
[1842.08 → 1848.00] this industry for this long but I had a very bizarre experience in an intel showroom at one point where
[1848.00 → 1854.80] they were showing off some next generation onboard graphics or something and on the little card next to
[1854.80 → 1862.40] the prototype it was like uh can run Fortnite at playable uh frame rates at these settings and then
[1862.40 → 1867.84] the game that they were running on it was like counterstrike and I was like hey so you guys know
[1867.84 → 1873.20] that Fortnite is like the biggest thing in the world right now why is Fortnite not running on the
[1873.20 → 1880.40] laptop, and they're like because we couldn't get them to agree to let us run it for the demo that would
[1880.40 → 1890.00] actually be kind of cool like a sticker from a third-party agency that gave you five to ten even
[1890.00 → 1899.28] uh current like I'd say important to the average consumer games and their certified performance levels
[1899.28 → 1905.04] yep that would be pretty cool this is I mean there are system integrators that try to do this to an extent
[1905.04 → 1910.48] so they'll and there are some that even try to spit out how many fps that you'll get um so it's not
[1910.48 → 1917.36] like this doesn't exist on a is level, but it's not being done well at all on mobile and I would like to
[1917.36 → 1926.56] see like your 30 60 and plus things for each game like these are the settings that you can run to get
[1926.56 → 1931.68] this frame rate certified on this laptop that would be cool I think that would be genuinely very helpful
[1931.68 → 1937.52] for consumers not like one score for the laptop as a whole but like a bunch of different games
[1937.52 → 1943.04] because drivers and stuff are going to be issues there yeah that's fair that's actually yeah that's
[1943.04 → 1950.88] not a bad idea, so this is like an for uh Fortnite, and it's like a b for Call of Duty, and it's a c for
[1950.88 → 1956.32] cyberpunk because nothing can run yeah because you could have a gamer that's only really interested in
[1956.32 → 1963.52] like Fortnite League of Legends and counterstrike um and if it scores really highly in those
[1963.52 → 1969.44] games then great they don't really necessarily care about the rest the only way to really do that
[1969.44 → 1977.04] is to keep industry from like influencing it though like because think about it think about how much
[1977.04 → 1981.76] pressure there's going to be so if I'm best buy right let's look at all the players right, so there's the
[1981.76 → 1989.36] manufacturers there's the game developers there are the retailers the resellers okay, so these are these
[1989.36 → 1993.28] are a few of the players that are going to be trying to exert influence on a program like this
[1993.28 → 2000.72] if I'm the manufacturer I want only the games that are going to reflect favourably on my machine to be
[2000.72 → 2007.36] shown on the little tag right okay yeah if I'm a game developer I don't want my game used to
[2007.36 → 2011.76] validate any machine that it's a bad experience on I'd just rather you don't mention me at all
[2012.32 → 2017.76] if I'm a retailer I don't want to put anything I mean you know the know good better best right
[2018.40 → 2024.88] you know in terms of product segmentation nobody ever wants to call anything bad, so everything has
[2024.88 → 2031.76] to be good better best and then if I'm a truly independent certification body that wants to provide
[2031.76 → 2037.28] meaningful information to consumers I have to be able to say no look I need to be able to
[2037.28 → 2043.84] put an f on something I have to be able to fail something or give it a c and you know what
[2044.80 → 2050.48] sorry CD project red I'm sorry, but you know the vast majority like there's literally no machine on
[2050.48 → 2056.40] the shelf of a best buy that is going to provide an experience in this game so that's just the
[2056.40 → 2061.68] reality of it I'm sorry I can't move the bar for you but every one of those and so every one of those
[2061.68 → 2067.76] players is able to exert pressure because manufacturers can just say okay well then we
[2067.76 → 2073.12] just won't submit our machine for certification game developers can say okay then we just won't
[2073.12 → 2077.60] license you to use our game for your testing and retailers will say okay well then we're just not
[2077.60 → 2081.20] going to put your certification on the shelf because it makes the products look bad and hurt sales
[2081.84 → 2086.80] so if you don't if you don't give in to our pressure and just give everything an then we just
[2086.80 → 2093.60] won't use it and there's no way to win I think the only potential way that I wouldn't even get around
[2093.60 → 2098.56] all those concerns at all, but it would hopefully maybe alleviate them a little bit maybe enough I'm
[2098.56 → 2107.28] not sure is to only show the things on there that get that good sort of good better the best certification
[2107.28 → 2113.28] everybody's going to try to get you to not show anything bad until there's nothing left to show and
[2113.28 → 2119.60] there is no certification program well no because there would be some things that the computer is
[2119.60 → 2125.92] going to be good at um, or it's not a gaming pc like kind of one of the two yeah but it just it ends
[2125.92 → 2130.88] up not meaningful because if all you can say is good things like I don't know I get a lot of people
[2130.88 → 2136.88] complaining to me that I'm too critical like why are you so critical it's like but because it's my job
[2136.88 → 2141.04] if all I said was good things I would just be the product manufacturer why don't you just go on their
[2141.04 → 2145.12] website why do you bother watching my video if all you want to hear is good things and you kind of
[2145.12 → 2150.16] need both sides you need super critical, and you need kind of more positive angles I guess I embrace
[2150.16 → 2159.12] my role yeah so yeah if you even is you started out with the best of intentions i just don't
[2159.12 → 2164.64] think that a program like that could work now I mean talking about it makes me like want to do it
[2164.64 → 2169.04] like oh yeah this wouldn't be that hard you just get laptops in you could kind of automate all the
[2169.04 → 2173.76] testing to a significant degree it spits out a report that basically goes yeah here was the
[2173.76 → 2179.52] acoustics and thermals the whole time so you can basically just like you drop it in uh an acoustic
[2179.52 → 2185.44] chamber uh you could totally do it you could totally do it you could totally do it is would be freaking
[2185.44 → 2192.96] awesome, and then it just probably wouldn't even need um line of sectors probably wouldn't even need
[2193.52 → 2199.36] like support from anybody you could just do it we could just do it is would be it would be a significant
[2199.36 → 2206.32] upfront investment in proper testing equipment because you can't tell the story of fps until you
[2206.32 → 2211.52] tell the story of thermals and acoustics especially with a completed device like a laptop because remember
[2211.52 → 2218.24] that's the concern with desktops from my perspective it's basically on you if you buy a case that doesn't
[2218.24 → 2223.60] have any ventilation and your graphics card doesn't perform properly like if you're building a system
[2223.60 → 2229.84] than you kind of have to do a little bit of research but when you buy a completed goods product
[2229.84 → 2238.16] like a laptop that's been in my opinion misleadingly marketed in this case I think you have a right to
[2238.16 → 2245.76] have a number that's actually meaningful shown to you and there are all kinds of other problems because
[2245.76 → 2251.60] you know for example uh some manufacturers have multiple modes that the laptop can operate in so
[2251.60 → 2258.96] testing ones like that could become a very, very cumbersome process where you have to like to put it
[2258.96 → 2267.12] in CPU OC mode and then fan turbo mode and then non-U OC mode non-fan turbo mode and then GPU OC mode and then
[2268.00 → 2273.04] that like so you're testing the same system you know eight ten different times with all the different
[2273.04 → 2277.68] you really want to automate it for sure yeah, but there are a lot of those things that wouldn't be
[2277.68 → 2282.16] possible to automate like you'd have to come back and press the button to put it in you know silence
[2282.16 → 2290.56] optimized mode and then sure yeah run it again yeah um we should probably jump into one of our actually we
[2290.56 → 2295.28] should probably talk sponsors today because we have to end the stream at a reasonable time uh because we
[2295.28 → 2300.72] have another stream coming shortly after this one it's going to be over on twitch and flow plane we are
[2300.72 → 2307.84] doing a memorial stream for Tyler uh one of the members of our team who um tragically passed away
[2307.84 → 2314.08] during the holiday this year it's going to be to support Tyler's family with some of the funeral costs
[2314.08 → 2321.04] um and then I think if they beat that target there's also um a charity that he cared
[2321.04 → 2326.48] about that they're going to be contributing to so stay tuned guys because we've got that coming after the
[2326.48 → 2334.16] wans show today I think the plan is 7 p.m pacific yeah Ivan's giving me the nod um we're going to be
[2334.16 → 2340.72] playing uh a game that he loved in tabletop simulator uh it should be perfect
[2341.60 → 2350.40] from like a like not like an I mean yeah it'll be nice to sit and remember him for a bit I don't know
[2350.40 → 2357.44] if I would describe it as like good um in the same way that like people being still with us would be
[2357.44 → 2363.20] good you know yeah uh so right we got to get through we got to get through our sponsors for
[2363.20 → 2369.84] the show today yes the show is brought to you today by kite is a plugin that adds AI powered

[2460.16 → 2466.56] head to squarespace.com forward slash when and use offer code when to get 10 off today finally the
[2466.56 → 2471.76] show is brought to you by vessie footwear is known for making comfortable shoes that are light
[2471.76 → 2478.72] and most importantly water-resistant with Jessie shoes you can walk in almost can you go out to deal with
[2478.72 → 2485.44] her oh okay uh you can walk in almost any terrain while keeping your feet dry as long as you don't walk
[2485.44 → 2490.96] like all the way in the water so that it comes up over the top only the material is water-resistant
[2490.96 → 2496.00] and they've got multiple different styles and colours to choose from every oh wow okay you can
[2496.00 → 2503.44] get 25 off each pair with offer code wans ho and check them out at vessie.com slash wans ho, and you have
[2503.44 → 2509.52] to say it exactly like that my girlfriend just bought a pair and I don't think she knew about the 25 off
[2509.52 → 2516.00] prepare code are you serious get wrecked yeah they like just showed up yesterday or something were
[2516.00 → 2524.40] you like to plenty time like you know that like they sponsor like i I did tell her uh she was she
[2524.40 → 2529.52] was talking about getting like water-resistant shoes and I did tell her that they sponsored us
[2529.52 → 2537.36] oh she said I did know and I used the Linus code so nice there we go nice way to go plenty time is she
[2537.36 → 2544.48] still streaming uh yeah okay nice nice nice that's that's where the plenty time uh nickname comes
[2544.48 → 2552.32] from that's her streamer tag yes uh we do also have one more kind of plug, but it's for ltdstore.com
[2552.32 → 2563.60] guess what it's actually pretty cool so john and Sarah collaborated on a new product let me
[2563.60 → 2569.76] just see if I can actually find a reference to it on the thing oh okay if I could take a turn in being
[2569.76 → 2581.60] critical maybe a little late on this one uh we know maybe look just it's still fun okay so
[2582.16 → 2589.28] orders over 50 dollars okay there's going to be a little pop-up the float plane team actually did
[2589.28 → 2594.72] the development for us for this which is pretty sweet thank you float plane team um they made it
[2594.72 → 2604.24] so that if you spend over 50 on the store you will get a free 2021 tech quickie flip calendar that was
[2604.24 → 2610.00] created just for you and all the other people who want one by the one and only john martin who writes
[2610.00 → 2617.28] tech quickie as well as illustrated by the one and only Sarah butt our secret shopper so it's got man
[2617.28 → 2622.64] it's got I think it's got like 80 illustrations or something like that and every day is uh an
[2622.64 → 2628.80] important event in tech history that took place on that day with fun little illustrations and all
[2628.80 → 2634.32] that so we don't expect you guys to necessarily go and spend a ton of money on it or anything like
[2634.32 → 2640.00] that we just expect you to go oh cool that's a neat extra you can just buy it for 20 bucks if you really

[2703.76 → 2709.60] birthday yeah I didn't think of that originally I had one, but it was like way too fake it was like
[2709.60 → 2718.24] saying that I was like 80 or something so that i just um in 2017 on November 12th a representative from
[2718.24 → 2724.80] Electronic Arts infamously leaves the most downvoted that was on my birthday the most downvoted comment
[2724.80 → 2730.72] in the history of Reddit regarding how long it took to unlock certain characters in the game Star Wars
[2730.72 → 2736.08] battlefront 2. I remember that very vividly that's actually pretty cool all right what's my birthday
[2737.20 → 2742.24] hit me with my birthday I will neither confirm nor deny if this is my fake or real birthday but I would

[2748.80 → 2755.92] like no spoilers hold on and then someone's like 20 for that are you kidding do you have any idea how
[2755.92 → 2761.20] long it took john and Sarah to do this, and it's its like mostly a bundle item, so most people are going

[2766.96 → 2778.16] what this one was no i I don't okay August 20th uh 1986 uh, uh Linus Sebastian of Linus oh you have to
[2778.16 → 2785.92] be kidding me he put that in their okay I actually did not know that was going to happen that's hilarious
[2789.12 → 2796.80] uh okay that's hilarious I don't know how to I don't know how to tell john this because if
[2796.80 → 2803.44] i I'm like hey that's pretty funny he'll know that I didn't proof it um but if I don't say anything
[2803.44 → 2809.76] then he might feel bad because then he'll know I didn't ever prove it oh my goodness that's even
[2809.76 → 2816.08] more funny I don't know so far jumping through to just two random dates this has been great I'm I'm
[2816.08 → 2822.48] excited yeah this is cool uh well good work thank you float plane team for making it happen
[2822.48 → 2831.52] let's jump into our next topic here it was a matter of time WhatsApp to start compulsory information
[2831.52 → 2837.92] sharing with Facebook by the way hon we probably need to switch off WhatsApp uh signal telegram
[2837.92 → 2842.72] something like that signal I've I've been using signal for quite a while now and I love if it's
[2842.72 → 2848.00] great I haven't like I haven't compared them recently because it hasn't really been a concern for me, I've
[2848.00 → 2851.92] been like yeah whatever Facebook owns WhatsApp who cares I'll just use it anyway because it's very
[2851.92 → 2857.36] convenient works really well um but I guess I don't know I might have to it didn't signal just
[2857.36 → 2862.64] recently launched video calling like didn't they like just finally get across the line of like feature
[2863.36 → 2869.12] parody enough that we could switch without caring I'm not sure because I've like never video called
[2869.12 → 2874.40] through either of those services it's not a thing I care about but um that would be pretty funny if that
[2874.40 → 2879.12] was the case can we have a side conversation here for a second here what is up with video calling
[2879.12 → 2887.28] just kind of all sucks um who I see people doing this I see people doing it they carry their
[2887.28 → 2891.60] phone around with them, they got their phone out in front of their face, and they're like walking down
[2891.60 → 2902.40] the street having a video call why yeah I don't know i I genuinely have no idea i that's a that's a category of
[2902.40 → 2908.00] person that I have definitely never been a part of and i I feel like I've known very few people that
[2908.00 → 2915.36] were a part of it okay because I just like for me, it's like i i i I don't I don't know I don't know
[2915.36 → 2920.08] how to talk about my objections to it without maybe sounding like a bit of a jerk or something
[2920.08 → 2926.48] so maybe I'll just I'll just roll I just don't get it personally like it feels like it's so much more
[2926.48 → 2934.56] effort for especially when you're like walking around randomly it's like mildly obnoxious it sounds
[2934.56 → 2942.16] like a lot more effort and for like what actual gain I don't I don't know so that person not seen you
[2942.16 → 2949.36] i I don't know i I mean okay I can see flipping it on momentarily like for example the badminton
[2949.36 → 2957.04] centre that i uh set up with that video gear um they were having trouble with like some
[2957.04 → 2960.80] cable or something and I was like oh why don't you just like flip on video, and it's like oh yeah yeah
[2960.80 → 2965.12] let's do that, and they pointed at the thing and I was able to walk through yeah so like it hasn't it
[2965.12 → 2972.00] absolutely has a problem i have used video calling before uh to get extremely not tech-savvy
[2972.00 → 2978.72] people to uh show me their screen so that I can verbally use their mouse for them to install team
[2978.72 → 2983.44] viewers so that I can actually control their computer it's been very helpful for that 100
[2984.16 → 2989.44] uh Jason roach says Linus i video call at the supermarket the missus is vegan and I need to know
[2989.44 → 2997.12] what to buy 100 so when you need to convey something that is much easier with video that's fine but why do
[2997.12 → 3001.76] you need to stare at each other's face while you're talking I don't understand it for like
[3002.24 → 3007.52] for like a more formal meeting I don't mind it but if I'm just talking to friends
[3008.16 → 3013.76] my phone's in my pocket and I've got my headphones in so that I can like to do other things because quite
[3013.76 → 3022.40] frankly i I'm not going to focus a hundred percent of my attention on you, i I don't know I mean my wife
[3022.40 → 3026.80] does it from time to time Vaughn why do you video call just anyone
[3026.80 → 3033.76] I don't yeah you sometimes do you video call like oh what's my sister who's far away yeah and I don't
[3033.76 → 3040.08] see them and I don't see the kids yeah you want to see them why see how much they've grown okay, okay
[3040.08 → 3046.56] so okay, okay a relative with kids you want to see like how they're growing up all right yeah, and you're
[3046.56 → 3054.80] like really far apart yeah it's nice to why makes you feel closer okay well there you go there it is
[3056.32 → 3059.68] she's tried to video call me while I've been travelling for work before and I'm just like do we
[3059.68 → 3068.00] have to do we need to well no, but the kids want to and I'm like see their generation is just going
[3068.00 → 3073.84] to be like well you know why wouldn't you just turn the feature on dad it's right there it doesn't
[3073.84 → 3080.24] take any more effort exactly yeah it's literally on by default what's wrong with you, you know what
[3080.24 → 3086.32] this is fascinating I was talking to my dentist um I was there yesterday getting the wire put on my
[3086.32 → 3094.40] braces, and he's he's very chatty my dentist is hilarious um so he's just going on about
[3094.40 → 3099.44] whatever random garbage, and he's like yeah did you hear about how there's a big uptick in cosmetic
[3099.44 → 3105.68] surgery lately and I'm like no I didn't and honestly that's totally counterintuitive to me because i
[3105.68 → 3113.84] would think with all the uh limitations around dating and going out in public and like hosting parties
[3113.84 → 3117.84] and just all those like social gatherings with all those limitations I would actually think
[3117.84 → 3125.44] people would be less inclined to do something like that not um and that's ignoring like the sort
[3125.44 → 3131.44] of the increase in risk and exposure of being in like a medical facility you know during these
[3131.44 → 3138.80] times, but then he's like no, no no, no it's all about Zoom meetings and I was like what why he's like
[3138.80 → 3143.76] yeah apparently it's just like psychologically it has to do with looking at your own face far more
[3143.76 → 3150.96] frequently seeing all those imperfections and wanting to fix them so you're checking your own
[3150.96 → 3157.20] camera feed and identifying and being way more self-conscious of yourself just like multiple
[3157.20 → 3163.84] times throughout the day and another angle on that i also kind of thought of is if you are
[3163.84 → 3170.16] someone who is your know not working like let's say you work in a field where you're where you are like
[3170.16 → 3175.52] me okay uh where video or pictures of you are taken every day let's say you're off work because you're
[3175.52 → 3180.00] like an actor or something and your productions are shut down hey that's a perfect time to get a tune-up
[3180.96 → 3186.88] so it could be one of either things either because you're not seeing people you could go, and you know
[3186.88 → 3191.36] get some tweaks done or because you're seeing people every day you feel more self-conscious and you
[3191.36 → 3195.84] go get some tweaks done, and he was like yeah yeah apparently it's been like a big thing like they're
[3195.84 → 3204.40] they're overrun they're inundated I'm like wow oh people you so you're so funny you so funny I don't
[3204.40 → 3211.28] think I will ever consider anything in that realm ever under any circumstance other than like being
[3211.28 → 3218.24] maimed you know what's funny I would have said that at one point in time or another and I had a
[3218.24 → 3222.64] conversation with I'm not going to name them just because I don't know if they're like chill with their
[3222.64 → 3227.44] views on this being out in the public but I had a conversation on a work trip you know how like the
[3227.44 → 3232.48] deep conversations tend to happen on like those overnight crazy trips where nobody sleeps anyway
[3233.20 → 3241.12] yep and I was kind of i was brought around to the point where I would at least think about it um
[3241.12 → 3247.76] because before I was like hard no and then I was like I would at least consider this and the argument was
[3248.48 → 3254.00] you know what is the difference between what you've already done I've had dental work done for
[3254.00 → 3260.32] example it's not like I couldn't eat before like it's it was purely cosmetic, and they're like what's
[3260.32 → 3267.44] the difference if there's a relatively uninvasive thing that you can do to make yourself look and feel
[3267.44 → 3274.32] better who cares and I was like I just feel like okay I'm just going to embrace my oldness because i
[3274.32 → 3279.20] i personally it's its not none of it for me is like there 's's no like moral battle here like
[3279.20 → 3285.44] I don't think it's a bad thing to do I don't look down on people that do it I don't care at all um but
[3285.44 → 3292.80] it's just i for me personally I find it less attractive and I don't mean like oh I find you hot I mean like
[3293.36 → 3300.08] just in general I find it less attractive when people try to hide like they're aging or whatever else
[3300.08 → 3306.32] like if someone's like balding, and they like to grow out a foot of hair on the back of their head and
[3306.32 → 3311.04] then just like wrap it around the rest of their head like that's I don't I'm not into that personally
[3311.04 → 3317.04] but if like okay like my dad started balding he's like okay just shaved it all off like i I think that's
[3317.04 → 3322.08] cooler in my opinion so that's your that's your angle that's your yeah I don't know that's my thing
[3322.08 → 3326.48] but then again I don't push that on anyone else so i just I probably wouldn't do it because
[3326.48 → 3333.28] I'm just yeah I'm just not into it so the line for this colleague that i again I don't want to name
[3333.28 → 3341.12] the line for this colleague was maintenance is chill but like for them anyway this was their
[3341.12 → 3345.28] personal opinion that I'm just kind of sharing with you guys their personal opinion was maintenance is
[3345.28 → 3352.64] chill but making like noticeable changes like becoming a different person yeah like becoming
[3352.64 → 3356.24] looking like a different person they were like yeah I'm I'm not that cool with that
[3356.24 → 3360.48] of course you know one of the reasons that everyone has such a different take on this is
[3360.48 → 3366.08] that everyone was born in a different body and has so personal yeah it's so personal 100 personal
[3367.36 → 3372.32] so it's its you know it's all fine and good for you know someone who was happened to be born with
[3372.32 → 3378.64] the gift of amazing looks to say yeah I look down on cosmetic surgery anyone who does it be disgusting
[3378.64 → 3383.92] by the way you know how do you like my you know perfectly shaped breasts and pouty lips and
[3383.92 → 3390.00] you know smoky eyes that I don't even you know I happen to be born with black you know lines along
[3390.00 → 3394.80] my eyes I don't even need eyeliner I look down on makeup you know like it's very easy depending on
[3394.80 → 3402.24] how someone was born for them to um for them to have a yeah definitely if it's going to like make
[3402.24 → 3407.20] in my opinion if it's going to make a notable improvement in your life to like to do whatever just do it like I don't
[3407.20 → 3413.92] I don't care at all just for me personally I feel like I would be happier and more confident in myself
[3413.92 → 3423.44] if I just embraced whatever was going on again you know you happen to be tall blue-eyed blonde um
[3424.00 → 3430.24] you know beard doesn't go in properly is there cosmetic surgery for like oh 100 have you seen
[3430.24 → 3437.60] before and afters of Elon's head like that's true actually because i posted just like a
[3437.60 → 3443.68] tongue-in-cheek um I posted a picture of Jeff Bezos on Twitter like a month ago or something like
[3443.68 → 3451.60] that and I was like the caption was scientific proof that every hair loss prevention um uh like cure is a
[3451.60 → 3457.28] scam because the richest man in the world not anymore the richest man in the world is you know spear balled
[3457.28 → 3462.48] right and then I think if you dropped all the money that his ex-wife currently holds like if
[3462.48 → 3467.60] they didn't break up I think he'd probably still be the richest man and then a ton of the comments
[3467.60 → 3475.04] were like um actually with before and afters of elon musk and I was like hmm I see actually
[3475.04 → 3481.36] they look the cures look pretty good it looks like as long as you've got a cool 100 billion or whatever
[3481.36 → 3486.88] he's worth these days you can take care of that someone knows how yeah real quick styles
[3486.88 → 3492.88] Elon knows the way it's like he's solving the big problems the world has like how to get to Mars and
[3492.88 → 3496.88] how to make sure that you can have a full head of hair as long as you got the money for it
[3497.60 → 3503.60] yeah um, so there's a ton of comments about this topic you guys are like super engaged on the topic
[3503.60 → 3509.28] i think quite a few people like feel very personally about it, i that's interesting and like
[3509.28 → 3514.16] and like I think a lot of people also judge other people's actions here quite a bit yeah totally
[3514.16 → 3518.72] so we've got people saying I've had to get if it's hard to figure out where to stop there's always
[3518.72 → 3524.00] more to get that's fascinating because for me as someone who's like only thought about it and
[3524.00 → 3532.24] kind of like a theoretical way um it's like yeah I could totally see how just like anything like
[3532.24 → 3538.16] uh getting into RC cars for example you get a starter car you go out and like you rip it around one
[3538.16 → 3544.40] time right, and you're like oh man I wish i I wish I had four-wheel drive or oh man I wish I got the
[3544.40 → 3552.08] brushless motor or like why didn't I spring for the lip battery lithium polymer is what
[3552.08 → 3557.68] I was talking about lithium polymer battery it's type of battery for RC cars okay the point is the first
[3557.68 → 3566.16] time you like to go for a ride on the subway, and you like get 10 more looks or whatever I can see how
[3566.16 → 3573.04] something like that the kind of endorphin hit you might get might make you like inclined to go back
[3573.04 → 3578.40] and get one more thing or one more thing or whatever else uh Javier says what about Botox for
[3578.40 → 3583.84] wrinkles I don't know for me personally I've always looked like this when I smile I went back and looked
[3583.84 → 3589.44] at a picture of myself when I was like 16 and like I've always been like this so I really don't think
[3589.44 → 3594.24] there's any solution for it for me yeah you mentioned it like a couple of years ago and I was like
[3594.24 → 3598.96] what I guess you're like I'm old I have crow's feet now and I was like what are you talking about
[3599.68 → 3604.48] it was okay they are a little heavier like so even when I'm not really smiling that much
[3604.48 → 3610.64] they're there now and they kind of like okay they're pretty good um I'm I'm doing okay but uh
[3610.64 → 3615.84] what would you do what would I do a really personal question you don't have to answer but like
[3616.48 → 3621.20] you said you've kind of vaguely thought about it so like what are what have you vaguely thought so
[3621.20 → 3626.32] for me the biggest things like I'm pretty I'm pretty comfortable in my own skin the only things
[3626.32 → 3630.56] that I really do I'll get you know what fine you know what screw it let's get real personal here
[3630.56 → 3638.24] um the only things I really do maintenance wise is like hair maintenance including uh eyebrows
[3638.24 → 3644.24] and that's after years of pressure from my wife, and also it's gotten worse if I let it go it really
[3644.24 → 3649.28] does start to connect these days and I'm like oh yeah it's really it's not that much effort and once you
[3649.28 → 3654.40] pull them a few times a start to come in less thick because you kind of kill the follicles by
[3654.40 → 3657.92] pulling them out repeatedly and b they don't hurt as much because they have like a looser grip so it's
[3657.92 → 3663.68] really not that bad any more um I went back and I got my teeth straightened that was both a cosmetic
[3663.68 → 3673.28] concern and an um a practical concern though so if you look uh yeah I don't know they're quite like down
[3673.28 → 3678.08] they're right here, and then they're kind of crowded here so what happens when you get crowding like
[3678.08 → 3684.16] that is they're harder to clean which makes it more likely for you to get cavities which makes it more
[3684.16 → 3693.44] likely for you to um well lose your front teeth and for me as someone who is a public figure um I don't
[3693.44 → 3702.72] consider um losing my front teeth to be really an option it's its sort of part of it's part of appearing
[3703.84 → 3710.48] nice on camera um and i remember my mom explaining this to me when they spent money we
[3710.48 → 3715.76] didn't have to have my teeth corrected in the first place because I used to have a fairly significant overbite
[3715.76 → 3721.92] um and I had the crowding before it was, and it was fixed before, but then it's over time it's kind of gone back
[3721.92 → 3729.84] together and my mom basically said um I'm making this investment in your personal appearance because
[3730.40 → 3737.20] straight teeth is about more than just looks it's an it's like a indicator of class, and it will give you more
[3737.20 → 3741.76] success in life and I was like whoa mom that is like some hardcore
[3741.76 → 3748.40] that's deep that is like some hardcore stuff to be talking about and like that's kind of like a
[3748.40 → 3757.84] really weird reason to get braces for your kid, but it's its also i I don't make the rules for how the
[3757.84 → 3763.60] world works she's not wrong um, and you know how parents tend to have an attitude that they want their
[3763.60 → 3769.92] kids to have opportunities that they didn't enjoy and so for her this was one of those things
[3769.92 → 3777.04] that was like no you absolutely need to you absolutely need to have straight teeth because
[3777.04 → 3785.68] people will judge you they will judge so much about you based on your smile and i I had a very significant
[3785.68 → 3792.72] overbite which combined with my already kind of large two front teeth um I think it looked kind of like
[3792.72 → 3799.76] this i I can't even do it anymore because part of the correction was I used to have an overbite that was like
[3799.76 → 3805.36] this big like I kid you not I could take like I could take the tops off of cans and stuff with my
[3805.36 → 3811.28] front teeth I'll be like oh yeah I shouldn't, you shouldn't do that kids that probably wasn't good
[3811.84 → 3816.40] not a good idea but like I could put my pinky finger in the gap between my bottom teeth and my
[3816.40 → 3822.08] front teeth like all the way up there like a huge overbite and um so one of the things that I got was
[3822.08 → 3828.32] these bite blocks that slide your lower jaw forward, and it's been annoying because my teeth don't like
[3829.12 → 3836.32] like they don't mesh up perfectly anymore like they kind of meet like this and like it's weird
[3836.32 → 3840.48] because my jaw has been moved so much like it's it kind of cracks sometimes and stuff like it's
[3840.48 → 3848.56] it's not like it's perfect, but it looks way better like my smile's not obviously way crooked and
[3848.56 → 3858.40] uh and like hugely overbitter and stuff um so yeah teeth I would do and I did I'm just trying to
[3858.40 → 3864.80] think of like what else I could, I've never personally until literally this stream I have never counted
[3864.80 → 3871.92] teeth, but they're the same thing it for sure I'm not against I'm just it's not something I considered i
[3871.92 → 3877.76] never thought of braces as like because i I had braces growing up too and for uh the parents
[3878.40 → 3883.92] probably financial situations and reasons were kind of pretty in line like didn't really have
[3883.92 → 3891.52] the money for it um but like I know i I remember I don't remember the conversation as vividly but i
[3891.52 → 3895.36] remember some of the reasons being kind of similar to this is going to be important later yeah we
[3895.36 → 3900.96] need to do it now it's expensive, but we want to do it right it's an investment in like your future is
[3900.96 → 3907.20] kind of your future this is very important and I hated it, and it bugs me like crazy that's funny I was
[3907.20 → 3914.40] super into it anyway I used to like now right no, no no i I got braces when I was like uh i I went to
[3914.40 → 3922.56] I went man my first day of high school I showed up with braces and fluorescent pink hair um it was I
[3922.56 → 3927.52] didn't mind the braces from like a social standpoint thing I didn't care about that I found them annoying
[3927.52 → 3932.16] um and I think after quite a while having them I got much more used to it, but they're really annoying
[3932.16 → 3937.36] at first I still have a bar below my behind my lower teeth I actually love that because I scratch
[3937.36 → 3942.24] my tongue on it all the time theoretically they're taking that out when I'm like 40 something and i
[3942.24 → 3948.16] don't even want them to it's probably going to be super weird you know what I think made me so enthusiastic
[3948.16 → 3954.64] about it, I told my mom and I told my orthodontist one thing I said please no headgear, and they tried to
[3954.64 → 3959.52] talk me into it, they were like well you know what if you only had to wear it for so many days a
[3959.52 → 3965.60] week or so many hours a day or whatever I was like please no headgear they found a way to do it
[3965.60 → 3973.92] without headgear and that made me extremely happy, and so I was just like I was all in um like I completed
[3973.92 → 3978.48] my appliances was what the things to slide my jaw forward I completed them so much faster than they
[3978.48 → 3983.12] expected because they're like yeah crank the thing once a week it was like to widen my palette
[3983.12 → 3987.12] and move my so I had to widen my whole jaw actually oh I forgot about that part right I had to
[3987.12 → 3991.68] widen my jaw because I had no um no space you can see I don't have enough space here still
[3991.68 → 3998.00] and they actually had to disc some of my teeth risking even compared to the cavity drill is the
[3998.00 → 4004.00] most unpleasant dental experience I have ever had in my life and I've had my I've had my bottom wisdom
[4004.00 → 4012.72] teeth out they take we're so far off of tech it is exactly what it sounds like Luke they take pretty
[4012.72 → 4021.28] much a Drexel, and they grind between your teeth it's like they slip it's the most it's the most
[4021.28 → 4027.12] terrifying like bone that's uncomfortable and I don't think it'll ever happen to me that's still so
[4027.12 → 4033.52] uncomfortable yeah oh my god and I okay I did wisdom teeth out while I was awake okay and risking was
[4033.52 → 4040.88] worse it was 20 years ago Luke and I still remember I still get like the hair standing up on the
[4040.88 → 4048.16] back of my neck when I think about it, it's so disgusting I hated it um yeah I don't I don't
[4048.16 → 4053.20] know what else like i kind of embrace my giant nose at this point I still remember having just the
[4053.20 → 4062.96] the funniest conversation with my mom where um I forget exactly how it went but um she basically said like
[4064.00 → 4070.08] you know I never noticed before, but you have a huge nose and I was like really because you
[4070.08 → 4077.20] never look at yourself from the side, and so I like yeah I like got my digital camera at the time and i
[4077.20 → 4085.36] like took a picture myself from the side I was like wow I have like a honking big nose but I'm like I'm
[4085.36 → 4092.88] into it, I'm okay with it, i i call it a royal nose you know like it's a regal nose dominant nose
[4093.44 → 4097.68] I mean it's the only thing on my body that's like you know big for my size right so i have to
[4100.08 → 4101.36] i have to stick with it, you know
[4105.68 → 4111.20] oh no oh Geez gotta you have to enjoy the small victories this month
[4113.76 → 4118.32] oh my goodness it's like if it was like it was down to who had the biggest nose and the smaller
[4118.32 → 4127.20] nose gets voted off the island I have a chance you know victory yes um all right i I don't know I've
[4127.20 → 4135.20] always thought that I would like maybe um fix things I don't know like if I was in an accident
[4135.20 → 4143.36] or something oh yeah yeah I would, I'd want to be myself yeah exactly I'd like to restore um and okay
[4143.36 → 4150.56] so on that note then okay fine like it comes down to those kinds of like those philosophical like those
[4150.56 → 4155.84] deep questions those 3 a.m questions you know like what age would you be if you were in heaven man
[4156.72 → 4163.60] right so like what is your true self is it yeah is it your 18-year-old self your 25-year-old self
[4163.60 → 4169.20] your 36-year-old self who knows right so like what is yourself so from that perspective whether it's the
[4169.20 → 4174.72] ravages of a bike accident or whether it's the ravages of time is it any more or less wrong I don't
[4174.72 → 4179.04] know I'm not in a position to answer that question okay well I think that yeah I think that's an individual
[4179.04 → 4183.84] thing you got to answer that for yourself yeah I can't think of i can't think of much else that
[4183.84 → 4188.96] I would change I mean my eyes are super uneven which is something that i also mostly notice when
[4188.96 → 4193.28] I'm on like a cheap webcam because there tends to be a little bit more lens distortion and I'll be
[4193.28 → 4198.72] like oh yeah right oh yeah that's my ears are uneven too they're off by like this much like it's
[4198.72 → 4202.96] quite substantial and I think my eyes are too so I have to kind of hold if you look okay I'll go right
[4202.96 → 4208.24] in front of the camera here so I have to hold my head at this angle for my eyes to be level
[4208.24 → 4209.84] so you'll never be able to unsee it now
[4212.96 → 4217.04] i honestly I can barely even I don't think you can really fix that you don't like notice
[4217.04 → 4221.76] these things about people like i never really noticed if people's ears or eyes are off or like
[4221.76 → 4226.16] if they like i I didn't know that you had a big nose until you told me that you had a big nose i
[4226.16 → 4230.96] don't even remember when that was but like I know that you have a big nose still only now because I know
[4230.96 → 4236.56] that you've told me like I've never really visually noticed it I don't know a really fun one um i
[4236.56 → 4240.88] remember doing this with like a friend years and years ago is you take a picture of yourself and
[4240.88 → 4248.64] then you copy and paste like the mirror image of both of them and you everyone has a good
[4248.64 → 4254.24] side 100 like one of my sides I was like dang and the other side I was like ew
[4254.24 → 4263.12] oh we got people in chat decide that you always want to like if you have to have a side profile
[4263.12 → 4268.24] like the one that you want I don't remember what mine is but I have one too uh people are like what
[4268.24 → 4276.08] is this stream even I'm not 100 um face Facebook will be uh forcing compulsory information sharing
[4276.08 → 4281.76] for WhatsApp uh, so there's a bunch of stuff information to be collected includes user phone numbers
[4281.76 → 4285.68] other people's phone numbers and stored address books profile names profile picture status
[4285.68 → 4291.76] messages including when a user was last online diagnostic data collected from app logs um well
[4291.76 → 4297.12] that we should like we should like to take a minute on the wan show and just like get everyone that's
[4297.12 → 4303.36] watching to uninstall it I'm going to do it right now I'm uninstalling it right now a spokeswoman
[4303.36 → 4307.92] to Ars Technica said this is part of a previously disclosed move to allow businesses to store and
[4307.92 → 4313.92] manage WhatsApp chats using Facebook's infrastructure wow the new privacy policy in terms of service are
[4313.92 → 4320.24] full are now more than 8 000 words long and filled with legal jargon, and it does not apply in Europe
[4320.24 → 4325.76] due to stronger privacy legislation there good job Europe all right so I think I'm going to try and get
[4325.76 → 4331.44] the people that I use that I talk with a lot to switch to signal we'll move to signal for our family and
[4331.44 → 4338.16] uh and hope that that lasts um I can't remember which one's better signal or telegram you
[4338.16 → 4343.60] said you were into signal right now I like signal I've been using signal for quite some time now
[4343.60 → 4349.44] um I have also heard very good things about telegram i I'm not going to war one against the other
[4349.44 → 4358.48] necessarily but i I like signal cool uh all right IKEA created furniture for the next gen consoles this is
[4358.48 → 4365.92] pretty sick this is posted by soldier underscore pH on the forums there they are which IKEA media
[4365.92 → 4372.32] storage unit will be able to fit my new uh modishly oversized gaming console haha there's no way that's
[4372.32 → 4379.04] the actual thing in IKEA wait is it really modishly you've got to be kidding me there's no way that's
[4379.04 → 4384.64] got to be like uh like a mock-up or fake thing or something uh okay at any rate we've got a couple
[4384.64 → 4388.40] more things to go through real quick but uh the Tyler memorial stream is supposed to be starting in
[4388.40 → 4394.00] like nine minutes so we got to go very soon here um trump was censored on various social media sites
[4394.00 → 4400.56] so that happened oh wait breaking news he got a Perm ban on Twitter as of 3 22 today seriously
[4401.60 → 4408.80] Perm man I didn't think they would ever do it yep I heard about that after close review of recent
[4408.80 → 4412.96] tweets from the at real Donald Trump account and the context around them, we have permanently suspended the
[4412.96 → 4418.72] account due to the risk of further incitement of violence look at that wow so that's what it I have
[4418.72 → 4426.32] been using Twitter less and less overtime so I heard about it but didn't even check Shopify took
[4426.32 → 4432.48] down some stores twitch and Snapchat disabled uh the president's accounts uh Facebook and Instagram
[4432.48 → 4440.96] banned um from posting for at least the next two weeks uh crazy apple has threatened to remove parlour
[4440.96 → 4446.40] a social media platform popular with many of Trump's supporters from the app store within 24 hours if
[4446.40 → 4456.64] the app doesn't begin moderating or removing extremist content dang it's like huh that's crazy
[4457.44 → 4463.20] people have been talking about parlour and a couple other apps similar i I believe similar to
[4463.20 → 4467.04] parlour over the last little bit and I've just been kind of thinking this whole time like
[4467.04 → 4473.28] like they're I'm sure they have websites I've never used them, but they're they're from my understanding
[4473.28 → 4479.20] very app based and that still means that you're beholden to the platforms that distribute the
[4479.20 → 4487.28] app yes you're not you're you're you're still you still have to deal with something else that can
[4487.28 → 4492.08] censor your platform so I've been kind of waiting for this to happen and I'm very unsurprised
[4492.08 → 4497.76] Reddit has also reported that they have taken action to ban the community r slash Donald Trump
[4497.76 → 4501.60] giving the repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. capitol
[4502.48 → 4506.72] interesting that's not an official group or page even it's its a community one and I'm
[4507.36 → 4514.56] quite surprised that they've uh that they've taken that step every everything related to this seems
[4514.56 → 4520.00] especially from the outside very surprisingly coordinated like this all seems very surprisingly coordinated
[4520.00 → 4523.44] and so does all the stuff that happened at the capitol but I don't I don't think we should
[4523.44 → 4531.44] necessarily get into that I'm not I'm just I'm just baffled that compared to you know a lot of other
[4531.44 → 4536.88] stuff that happened in the last four years and like a lot of other people that have died in the last
[4536.88 → 4545.92] four years that all of a sudden it's a big deal now um yeah go figure what a world we live in isn't it
[4545.92 → 4552.88] if it's quite odd uh but in other news uh switch dodders find evidence of a switch pro in the latest
[4552.88 → 4557.44] switch update and 4k in docked mode may be a possibility that's all there is to really say
[4557.44 → 4563.28] about that um yeah let's not talk about that you think they have actual dock hardware now
[4565.36 → 4571.12] um dock pro oh because this was something we were talking before the switch came out
[4571.12 → 4574.96] um this is like before the original switch came out this is something I believe we talked about on
[4574.96 → 4579.20] wan show I believe you and I debated about whether there would be hardware in the dock like an
[4579.20 → 4584.96] upscale or anything else um, and it ended up not being true I don't remember which side either of us
[4584.96 → 4591.20] were on about that topic but I think I wanted it to be true but I don't remember what I actually thought
[4591.20 → 4598.96] was going to happen um, but this might be it now there might be a dock pro um if it's going to act
[4598.96 → 4606.56] differently when it's docked I don't know maybe all right sure i have to run because i uh have to
[4606.56 → 4612.64] troubleshoot Ivan's webcam for the stream today I will do just a couple super chats here there were a
