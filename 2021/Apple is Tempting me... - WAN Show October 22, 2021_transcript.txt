[0.00 --> 5.04]  welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[5.04 --> 13.12]  starting of course with oh man i don't even know i don't know what to start with uh intel alder lake
[13.12 --> 19.84]  processors are all of a sudden available at retail so that's kind of a big deal thing that happened
[19.84 --> 24.80]  especially since uh according to the latest leaks they're not supposed to launch for like
[24.80 --> 31.52]  another two weeks speaking of launches apple launched what might be the most pro oriented
[31.52 --> 36.80]  computer that they've launched since the mac pro which was the most pro oriented computer that they
[36.80 --> 42.40]  had launched in years so we're going to be talking about the new macbook pro that is actually for pros
[42.40 --> 50.08]  again what else we got missouri governor vows to prosecute uh inspecting element or the f12 key or
[50.08 --> 55.36]  console or whatever where you can see html on a web page uh kind of kind of awkward we'll talk about
[55.36 --> 65.04]  that a little bit later also ea and fifa are breaking up is everyone leaving ea what ea and fifa are
[65.04 --> 71.44]  breaking up that's really exciting who will i go to for my updated rosters what if i want to spend too
[71.44 --> 78.96]  much on setting up a custom roster in a in a video game what do i do i don't know hey someone other
[78.96 --> 79.92]  than ea no
[90.64 --> 91.04]  terrible
[96.08 --> 97.04]  i was so sad
[100.00 --> 106.24]  the no was great and the show is brought to you by corsair ridge wallet and ultium
[106.24 --> 113.60]  all right let's jump right into our first topic and this is one that is not in the doc but i
[113.60 --> 117.92]  went impromptu linus and i was like we are going to talk about this because
[118.72 --> 127.28]  i am super angry about it so this article is from digital trends there are retailers out there who are
[127.28 --> 134.40]  evidently already selling intel 12th generation alder lake processors not only that but at a cheap price
[134.40 --> 144.08]  and it's sort of hard to argue with the evidence here so reddit user sebi9123 apparently got his or her
[144.08 --> 154.32]  hands on two 12 900k processors and that looks like a pretty credible looking box shot so as far as i can
[154.32 --> 162.16]  tell individual end users are able to get their hands on these chips and without disclosing anything
[162.16 --> 170.96]  that would get me in trouble because of our nda with intel i'm gonna say that it is conceivable that end
[170.96 --> 177.84]  users could have these chips to work on testing or benchmarking them or whatever the case may be
[178.40 --> 186.48]  before members of the press who have signed non-disclosure agreements with intel about these
[186.48 --> 193.60]  processors on what planet does that make any sense this also isn't the first time no getting some major
[193.60 --> 197.36]  deja vu right now it's not the first time it's not even the first time recently
[200.32 --> 208.80]  like i'm not even talking ever like this happened very recently yes it drives me absolutely crazy i give
[208.80 --> 219.04]  i mean to be clear i it's not how do i make it how do i explain why this is a problem um because you know
[219.04 --> 226.72]  i think that a lot of people are gonna jump straight to spoiled media the media complaining they don't get
[226.72 --> 236.00]  a free cpu it's not about that no it's about making sure that you are following the the the
[236.00 --> 245.20]  the consumer friendly order of things stuff should not you should not be jumping the gun and opening
[245.20 --> 252.56]  something up for sale before anyone has an opportunity to review it because in my mind that demonstrates
[252.56 --> 258.64]  that you have something to hide now to be clear i don't think that intel is going out of their way to
[258.64 --> 265.44]  make these chips available to end users before press are able to get an opportunity to review them because
[265.44 --> 272.00]  i think that especially in a case where you have a product that you're confident in you want as much
[272.00 --> 278.16]  media coverage of the thing as possible because you know that it's going to drive demand like that is
[278.16 --> 285.92]  the symbiotic relationship between reviewers and manufacturers the manufacturer is genuinely confident
[285.92 --> 292.48]  in their product they send it to independent third-party media for evaluation and those independent
[292.48 --> 299.36]  third-party media are trusted therefore when they say yes it's good that should increase sales now
[299.36 --> 304.88]  the other side of that the other the other edge of that blade is that if manufacturers make something
[304.88 --> 312.24]  that frankly isn't that competitive they get called out but that's just the price that you pay for the
[312.24 --> 319.36]  credibility boost that you get from these independent media that review your products so for us to be able to do
[319.36 --> 327.12]  our job we need time it's that simple especially if you want reviewers to be able to do a good job
[327.12 --> 332.00]  because there's been a lot of times in the past where reviewers will receive something without enough
[332.00 --> 338.80]  time to do a thorough investigation even if you assume that they're working 24 hours around the clock
[338.80 --> 347.12]  and that is that is absolutely something that to me you know indicates that a manufacturer might have
[347.12 --> 354.24]  something to hide when we get a sample on the thursday before a long weekend with an embargo lift on the
[354.24 --> 361.52]  monday we look at and we go you don't want us to look that closely at this do you yeah yeah that's exactly
[361.52 --> 370.08]  yeah 100 percent and again to be clear i don't think that this is intel's malice showing through i think
[370.08 --> 377.20]  that this comes down to incompetence i think that this is them not having careful enough control of
[377.20 --> 382.96]  where they're where their retail units are going and them not doing a good job of managing managing
[382.96 --> 389.12]  their partners to be clear i'm not saying that they have to go full nvidia and you literally i'm man
[389.68 --> 397.28]  you talk to an nvidia partner you haven't you talk to an nvidia partner of any size and any shape off the
[397.28 --> 406.08]  record and they've got the fear of god in them like it's just i don't remember the last time there
[406.08 --> 414.72]  was a major nvidia gpu like like retail gpu performance benchmark league because everyone is
[415.28 --> 421.44]  terrified whereas intel has demonstrated time and time and time and time again i mean tom's hardware has
[421.44 --> 427.20]  been has been publishing leaked benchmarks with engineering sample chips since before i was working in the
[427.20 --> 434.80]  industry and they've never stopped getting support of like like proper chips right like they they just
[434.80 --> 440.72]  they just continue to have the relationship whereas nvidia they will they will go after you
[441.52 --> 446.96]  yeah if you if you publish something that you knew you weren't supposed to you are on the list
[446.96 --> 451.68]  like you are never they're they're never going to talk to you again they have an extremely long memory
[451.68 --> 457.60]  um so i'm not saying that intel has to go full nvidia but i'm saying that you have to at least
[457.60 --> 460.48]  respect the results of nvidia's approach
[464.08 --> 470.16]  so there's that so yeah it's it's really frustrating uh and it's one of those things that
[470.16 --> 477.52]  is particularly frustrating because we try to play by the rules like we try because it's important for
[477.52 --> 483.92]  consumers that we are getting access to proper materials right so we could go rogue we could go
[483.92 --> 488.64]  and buy these chips right and then we could go try and get our hands on compatible boards and compatible
[488.64 --> 494.16]  ram in this case there's a new ddr memory generation coming out with the new platform this is all stuff
[494.16 --> 500.32]  that is a legend fine let's say it's thoroughly leaked they're not backwards compatible right or i guess
[500.32 --> 506.40]  that would be a not according to the leaks right okay okay so but the point is that we want to do things
[506.40 --> 510.96]  properly because we could go out there and we could get our hands on engineering sample chips or on
[510.96 --> 517.76]  engineering sample boards but then what we would not have is we would not have access to necessarily
[517.76 --> 524.96]  the final product yeah because if there's a really important microcode update or if that chip that we
[524.96 --> 531.60]  got that fell off the back of a truck is not a proper chip like if it's an engineering sample or
[531.60 --> 538.32]  even a qualification qualification sample should be basically a retail grade chip but what if it's
[538.32 --> 545.12]  not right so if we went and we published based on that we could be giving you guys false information
[545.12 --> 550.00]  so that's not it's not in our best interest and it's not in your best interest it's in our best
[550.00 --> 554.72]  interest and yours that we are working with intel we have the proper bios updates we have the proper
[554.72 --> 560.32]  drivers and everything is legitimately representative of the product you are going to buy that's what is best for
[560.32 --> 567.28]  everyone but if the partners who play by the rules in order to bring you guys the best most accurate content
[567.28 --> 575.60]  are somehow at a two-week disadvantage in covering the product i don't get it and then yeah that's to
[575.60 --> 582.80]  nobody's benefit yeah then there's no incentive whatsoever to follow the rules so then everything's just
[582.80 --> 590.16]  a mess and it's not good for anybody so i just am i'm frustrated i'm frustrated and i'm venting
[590.16 --> 596.32]  my frustration i realize at this point that there's pretty much nothing that i can do about it because
[596.32 --> 602.96]  the really stupid thing is once you have signed an nda that you won't you know publish these benchmarks
[602.96 --> 609.68]  or whatever even if we got our hands on a chip through like retail means that is an extremely
[610.40 --> 618.64]  gray legal area i mean we could go to intel we could say you know what an nda is invalid the second that
[618.64 --> 624.16]  that that information is available to the general public by means of someone that is a thing someone
[624.16 --> 630.00]  other than you yeah absolutely we could make that argument and then if intel really wanted to they
[630.00 --> 636.40]  could make our lives a living hell while they fight it out with us in court yep because legal fees are
[636.40 --> 641.20]  really oppressive yes there's this whole mechanic where like if you have enough money you can just bury
[641.20 --> 646.16]  bury someone basically zatharian and floatplane chat asks can you even say if you have review samples yet
[646.16 --> 653.44]  typically it is uh covered by the nda that you are not allowed to disclose if you have review samples of
[653.44 --> 662.16]  an upcoming product um jamal taylor says steve did just that and had no issues so steve steve marches to
[662.16 --> 668.08]  the beat of his own drum yeah um and you gotta you gotta have a lot of respect for steve's approach
[668.08 --> 675.52]  it's not the same as my approach uh what i would rather is i would rather complain about systems that
[675.52 --> 681.84]  don't make any sense and see reform in the industry i have actually i have actually seen my feedback
[681.84 --> 688.40]  to companies like amd is an example of a company that has taken my frustrated feedback and turned it
[688.40 --> 695.12]  into new policies that have benefited me and steve um actually it was at an event that we were all at
[695.68 --> 703.04]  that they were they pulled this like really this super weird thing where you weren't allowed
[703.04 --> 711.20]  uh i forget what exactly the details were but you weren't allowed to have the slide deck without
[711.20 --> 718.24]  uh without a watermark on it until like 15 minutes before the embargo lift uh cool or something like
[718.24 --> 724.08]  that one of those like this makes sense for written press but not video and yeah but they didn't ban
[724.08 --> 732.72]  cameras in the presentation hall nice so leaks went up immediately from the presentation hall from people
[732.72 --> 741.04]  taking pictures with their phones and i basically came to them and i was like look if i had not
[741.04 --> 749.28]  played nice if i had taken pictures i could be editing my video right now but i didn't i played nice
[750.64 --> 759.60]  give me the non-watermarked slides so that i can edit my video and export it you guys are a computer
[759.60 --> 766.48]  processor company right they make computer processors you know that it takes time to process
[768.00 --> 774.48]  and i'm in a position where if i have to wait for non-watermark slides i'm going to be probably
[774.48 --> 780.56]  because of the crappy hotel internet right i'm going to be two three hours after the written media
[780.56 --> 785.84]  even with quick sync how does that make which is not an empty product how does that make right any
[785.84 --> 792.16]  sense why am i at a disadvantage because i'm trying to play by the rules what you guys need to do is
[792.16 --> 800.24]  you need to give me the non-watermark slides now so that i have time to make a video so anyway the point is
[801.60 --> 809.92]  we have actually seen amd be more accommodating to video media ever since that conversation and so
[809.92 --> 814.80]  that's the way that i prefer to go about things there are companies that take my feedback and throw
[814.80 --> 822.48]  it into a fire and just completely do not care um we've run into numerous situations actually quite
[822.48 --> 830.48]  recently with amd even where they have even gone as far as to brief us so that we have time to make a
[830.48 --> 838.96]  video but then have withheld key pieces of information so we cannot finish and export the video and upload it
[839.92 --> 844.80]  and you guys you guys saw this i believe in one of our recent event coverages with amd where there was
[844.80 --> 850.72]  a clip that was spliced into the video after the fact um and actually there was one with uh
[851.92 --> 858.64]  who was it i forget who it was i think it might have been nvidia where we had to yeah we had to record
[858.64 --> 865.44]  our review of the product before we had final pricing and it's like people got really mad at us for it
[865.44 --> 872.08]  and i'm sitting here going okay this is this i guess yeah i made a call i made a call that we're
[872.08 --> 879.12]  going to go ahead and and record it knowing approximately the price knowing leaked pricing
[879.12 --> 885.28]  based on you know talking to people i don't not going to name any names like we had a pretty solid
[885.28 --> 890.40]  idea but no we didn't know we couldn't read out the exact number you know we didn't know if it was
[890.40 --> 896.40]  going to be a 99 cents or a 98 cents right uh so i made the call i was like okay you know in in the
[896.40 --> 901.84]  interest of having this video up on time we're gonna we're gonna go for it um maybe i made the wrong call
[901.84 --> 909.68]  but also you know i believe that trusted press that these companies have been working with for
[909.68 --> 915.60]  you know in my case for some of them like 10 years should just have the right information so that we
[915.60 --> 920.64]  can do our jobs because one of the big arguments that i made about the watermark slides was look we
[920.64 --> 926.56]  both look like idiots if i upload this video with watermarks all over the slides yeah we we both look
[926.56 --> 931.68]  unprofessional how about we just all be professional we have a proper professional working relationship
[932.16 --> 940.64]  and what's wrong with that i mean realistically the ones leaking the information are not the ones
[940.64 --> 948.08]  that you should be inviting to your briefings anyway just stop i i've even i've even proposed
[948.08 --> 953.52]  actually to all three all red green and blue i've proposed multiple times like have you ever heard of
[953.52 --> 960.96]  um oh what's it an elimination diet elimination yes yeah so if you haven't is if you're having some
[960.96 --> 968.40]  kind of allergic reaction um you what you can do is you can go to like a very very bland like
[968.40 --> 974.40]  basically start with one food kind of diet and then you gradually add things to it try to figure
[974.40 --> 979.68]  out what it is that's causing trouble for you and um i i've proposed i've said like look why don't
[979.68 --> 985.28]  you just guys why don't you guys just go full elimination diet here give your news to just a very
[985.28 --> 992.08]  very very select few and then gradually expand and expand and expand the circle until you figure out
[992.08 --> 998.40]  who is selling information to leaker sites and uh no no one's taken me up on it because i think the
[998.96 --> 1005.68]  the cost and hassle of running a program like that when there is a clear nobody ever wants to talk about
[1005.68 --> 1011.60]  it but when there's a clear benefit to leaking particularly for a hot or anticipated product
[1011.60 --> 1017.84]  it's clearly not worth it but it's one of those things where it's like okay fine then embrace it
[1017.84 --> 1023.76]  yeah fine then if you know that all this information is going to be out there then why don't you just
[1023.76 --> 1028.48]  seed us at the same time and then we can all leak it like we can all just say hey these are early
[1028.48 --> 1033.76]  benchmarks with engineering sample chips like and that's fun whatever which would be fine too yeah yeah
[1034.32 --> 1039.04]  i i always bring up the story of nvidia we're like and you know this one because i called you and you're
[1039.04 --> 1042.72]  like why are you calling me because we had just had this conversation about how i needed to do these
[1042.72 --> 1047.76]  events more solo we had we had this conversation about how i needed to be able to be more of my
[1047.76 --> 1052.40]  like own ship when i was doing these events yeah so i knew i was supposed to not bother linus while i
[1052.40 --> 1059.20]  was down here i was like okay the idea was that when luke's out of office it was it was a big opportunity
[1059.20 --> 1065.68]  cost right because he wasn't producing the two or three videos he might be producing in the span of like
[1065.68 --> 1070.64]  we got the travel day then you got the event day sometimes there was like like a like a press like
[1070.64 --> 1076.64]  event thing and like another travel days out of office like all week there's this enormous opportunity
[1076.64 --> 1081.52]  not distract the only other person that can make videos yes like it totally it makes sense i'm not
[1081.52 --> 1087.36]  so but i knew i wasn't supposed to call linus but then just like everything possible to not use that
[1087.36 --> 1093.60]  particular word was hitting the fan and i was like okay i actually think i need to call like
[1094.24 --> 1099.68]  and like he ends up talking to one of their very high up press people on the phone and being like
[1099.68 --> 1104.24]  what the heck like you guys need to figure this out and that was really helpful and i kyle ended up
[1104.24 --> 1109.04]  filming his video like out on the street i ended up filming my video while they were tearing the event
[1109.04 --> 1114.88]  down they had specifically bussed us out to a location where we like couldn't edit or upload properly
[1114.88 --> 1119.60]  um and there was like no reasonable way for us to get back and like and it was really far from a hotel
[1119.60 --> 1124.40]  like all it was it was horrible and very specifically set up to be oppressive towards
[1124.40 --> 1130.96]  media like that was the goal and you could tell um and it was brutal it was terrible yeah and you could
[1130.96 --> 1136.16]  see like we weren't the only ones there was all these different outlets like trying to figure out how
[1136.16 --> 1144.32]  to do this in the most like non-clean way effectively but like but barely somehow able to get your video out
[1144.32 --> 1150.96]  still it was such a mess yeah so annoying really frustrating and the the it's just unnecessary i
[1150.96 --> 1157.12]  mean there's people that are like linus thinks that people should just like be so happy when he gives them
[1157.12 --> 1163.68]  a suggestion or something like that it's like no it's not it's not that it's about just being decent
[1164.40 --> 1172.80]  like recognizing that when you launch a product at uh you know on december you know 20th or something
[1172.80 --> 1179.44]  that a lot of people have stuff going on around that time of year and maybe that's actually really
[1179.44 --> 1185.52]  rude and maybe what you should do is you should give a slightly longer embargo or here's a crazy idea
[1185.52 --> 1190.48]  get us the product a little bit early so that we have some extra time or i mean the example that i gave
[1190.48 --> 1197.12]  of launching something around a long weekend even if i wanted to pay the overtime which we've done we've
[1197.12 --> 1204.96]  done it when we've had to recognize like maybe say sorry maybe say hey sorry i know that not only is
[1204.96 --> 1211.20]  this costing your organization way more money than it has to in order to cover it um which we're not
[1211.20 --> 1215.76]  reimbursing you in any way for because there's no cash changing hands this is a product review obviously
[1215.76 --> 1221.04]  there needs to be no cash and there needs to be no cash changing hands uh maybe acknowledge that you are
[1221.04 --> 1226.88]  you are costing our organization a bunch of money and not just that but there's a human element what
[1226.88 --> 1233.92]  if anthony wanted to do something else this weekend did you ever stop to consider that maybe anthony has
[1233.92 --> 1239.92]  a life and maybe brandon or david has a life and doesn't want to come in on a saturday and film this
[1239.92 --> 1246.24]  video did you did you ever consider that and it just feels like there's there's a lot of there's a lot of
[1246.24 --> 1253.28]  just hey couldn't this whole thing be better for everyone if we tried to work with each other and we
[1253.28 --> 1260.56]  tried to and we tried to be respectful of each other's time uh that that's the big thing that that's
[1260.56 --> 1265.36]  the big thing for me is it just doesn't seem that hard to be respectful of each other's time
[1267.28 --> 1276.16]  um i believe it was the 1080 launch uh ii r f t w um because basically that was that was at a time
[1276.16 --> 1283.84]  that um or was it 980 ti i can't remember though the event that you attended i believe it was was
[1283.84 --> 1288.48]  it the one that was right before workcation no oh it was a different one um because that one was
[1288.48 --> 1294.00]  a gong show too that one was also a gong show that was 1080 uh got it okay it was not that one though
[1294.00 --> 1297.76]  i don't actually remember what it was yeah i don't know it doesn't it was 980 or 980 ti
[1298.32 --> 1302.64]  something like that i know i went to 980 so it might have been might have been 980 ti then because
[1302.64 --> 1309.28]  i remember going to 980 okay but um yeah it was just basically you know nvidia went through a phase
[1309.28 --> 1314.00]  and i'm not sure if they're over it but they went through a phase where they were really pushing to
[1314.00 --> 1319.52]  control the narrative around their products and be the ones that people learned about anything from it
[1319.52 --> 1326.56]  was kind of uh um i mean you've seen them kind of figure out how much or how little they need partners
[1326.56 --> 1332.24]  over the years uh you know whether it's launching founders edition cards uh you know built by nvidia
[1332.24 --> 1340.32]  graphics cards rather than focusing entirely on uh on partner built cards or or whatever right like
[1340.32 --> 1345.68]  you've seen them kind of push the limits of how much could we just do all this ourselves and capture
[1345.68 --> 1351.76]  all the value ourselves do do we actually need media at all i don't know hard to say um so that was
[1351.76 --> 1355.28]  that was around that was around the time that there were a lot of initiatives where they were just kind
[1355.28 --> 1361.44]  of trying to control the narrative and it was i think it was basically that they didn't give you guys
[1361.44 --> 1366.96]  any information they revealed everything on stage so you were basically just a live audience watching
[1366.96 --> 1370.56]  what could have been a live stream that you could have just watched from the comfort of your office
[1370.56 --> 1375.60]  or home and then reported on from the comfort of your office or home but instead they dragged you out
[1375.60 --> 1380.08]  to this thing gave you no information until they gave it to everyone and then you're in this position
[1380.08 --> 1386.08]  where you you then can't do any work yeah we we were in the basement below where the event was actually
[1386.08 --> 1392.00]  going to happen and they didn't give us key information until the live stream so yeah we
[1392.00 --> 1397.28]  were we were just stuck sitting there it was it was really annoying uh anthony says it was apparently
[1397.28 --> 1405.60]  1080ti somehow anthony remembers this better than you and me okay that's funny what a king anthony you
[1405.60 --> 1412.48]  don't have to be monitoring the land show it's the weekend baby did 1080 i come out first no 1080 was first
[1412.48 --> 1419.68]  oh weird yeah yeah whatever um all right why don't we move on to our next topic hey you know who
[1419.68 --> 1428.00]  is you know who is turning over a new leaf who apple oh i mean what we went through this period with
[1428.00 --> 1435.04]  apple where it felt like it was design first over functionality to the point of just being
[1435.60 --> 1438.24]  ridiculous i know someone who's upset about the ports
[1438.24 --> 1449.04]  i had that same reaction i was very surprised i was very very surprised let's get to that in a
[1449.04 --> 1457.84]  moment okay first let's talk about how apple has gone full circle the other full circle full swing the
[1457.84 --> 1464.88]  other way and made a macbook pro that really really does look designed for pros without coming out and
[1464.88 --> 1476.64]  just saying we're sorry are bad they've pretty much said it the touch bar is gone uh the webcam is now
[1476.64 --> 1484.80]  1080p the crappy keyboard is gone i mean that's that's not new but that's uh yeah what was it last gen i
[1484.80 --> 1492.80]  think so the the crappy keyboard is now gone the ports are back basically every move that apple has made over
[1492.80 --> 1501.04]  the last five six years seemingly for the sole purpose of antagonizing professional users is gone
[1502.00 --> 1508.56]  can we just can we just yeah yeah yeah i'm down i mean they still need to figure out their right to repair stuff
[1508.56 --> 1514.80]  yeah they still need to figure out how to not be so far up their own rectums that it's really hard to listen to them talk
[1514.80 --> 1538.80]  there's there's certain things that apple could do to fix up their attitude but but antagonizing professionals for no reason is no longer one of them so they've got two new socs announced m1 pro and m1 max okay that's the stupidest thing ever uh their naming schemes for a company that spends the amount that they do on marketing
[1538.80 --> 1544.24]  they didn't they didn't foresee the problem with having macs that are max
[1546.88 --> 1549.04]  yeah that's pretty rough that's pretty bad
[1551.52 --> 1560.08]  i mean i remember i remember when apple would would be openly disdainful of companies like samsung having
[1560.08 --> 1568.16]  all these different confusing models no no we have iphone no no now you got you got your you got your se you
[1568.16 --> 1574.32]  got your your pro you got your pro max you got all your different you got all your different suffixes
[1574.32 --> 1580.56]  you're no better than intel at this point okay you're a little better than intel no no you're worse than
[1580.56 --> 1585.68]  intel i take it back i was going to say you're better than intel because intel's product names are just
[1585.68 --> 1592.08]  utterly undecipherable like especially on the server level those are what am i even looking at i have no idea
[1592.08 --> 1599.84]  um but at least what intel manages to do is put a generational number on things and like at least
[1599.84 --> 1604.64]  somewhat attempt to categorize things even though that becomes messy all the time new macbook pro
[1605.52 --> 1615.36]  like new macbook pro plus they gotta do that that'd be great he's so good there's two new socs m1 pro m1 max
[1615.36 --> 1620.72]  and despite not now having fine print showing what computers the company is comparing itself against
[1620.72 --> 1628.64]  apple's charts were as obtuse as ever with an axis labeled as relative performance what does that
[1628.64 --> 1635.04]  even mean they had a lot of emphasis on power efficiency with both socs featuring a cpu with
[1635.04 --> 1641.04]  eight high performance cores and two efficiency cores totaling 10. though it should be noted that the base
[1641.04 --> 1646.64]  skew has eight cores there are actually a ton of different variants in spite of the fact that apple is
[1646.64 --> 1651.20]  soldering everything right to the main board i actually think they did an outstanding job of
[1651.20 --> 1658.40]  providing a reasonable degree of choice when it comes to cpu gpu and memory configurations so much
[1658.40 --> 1664.08]  choice in fact that it ended up costing me about as much as a decent car because i told the guys
[1664.08 --> 1669.52]  internally i was like look here's something we can do because apple doesn't see this product right so we
[1669.52 --> 1676.96]  have no opportunity to review a mac um you know on the same review schedule as other media so i said okay
[1676.96 --> 1682.48]  look here's how we're gonna stand out we're gonna buy every config we're gonna review the configs that
[1682.48 --> 1691.12]  apple doesn't want to cede to the press so i spent like 25 000 on macbooks earlier this week okay nice so
[1691.12 --> 1697.60]  that was uh sheesh that was a heck of a thing uh the good news is we we can just flip them like the they
[1697.60 --> 1703.68]  should hold their value reasonably well uh but yeah you can expect to see so so it cost me a lot
[1703.68 --> 1709.44]  of money but respect to apple for at least having a lot of different configurations so m1 pro is
[1709.44 --> 1717.20]  available at 16 or 32 gigs of unified lp ddr5 memory with a bandwidth of 200 gigabytes per second it's
[1717.20 --> 1723.12]  available with a 14 or 16 core gpu and then there's a media engine that provides hardware encode and
[1723.12 --> 1730.24]  decode acceleration of h264 hvc and all the pro reses so basically you know that weird afterburner
[1730.24 --> 1737.28]  card which i think is truly if not the weirdest one of the weirdest products that apple has released
[1737.28 --> 1744.72]  in the last 10 years what a weird product that was cool but weird super cool but it's the kind of thing
[1744.72 --> 1752.88]  that i would expect some some you know weird like off the wall silicon valley startup yeah make yeah
[1753.44 --> 1758.48]  fly by night thing that's like probably not going to exist in five years but two years let alone five
[1759.28 --> 1767.04]  what a weird product that was um and now it's now it's gone because it's built into the m1 silicon
[1767.04 --> 1775.52]  i can drive two pro display xdrs and then the m1 max doubles the gpu cores um all you got to do is
[1775.52 --> 1782.16]  look at the pictures it is a man is a big chip i have what max looks amazing so doubles the gpu cores
[1782.16 --> 1789.92]  it's available 24 or 32 memory gets doubled as well so it's 32 or 64 gigs of unified memory with 400
[1789.92 --> 1796.72]  gigabytes per second of bandwidth the media engine is doubled and it gets double the display output so
[1796.72 --> 1802.32]  uh three 6k displays with a single 4k display is how i'm reading this uh this is from jonathan
[1802.32 --> 1806.64]  horst's note so correct me if i've got the display bit wrong it looks like he's got it annotated in a
[1806.64 --> 1815.04]  bit of a weird way now let's talk about the ports hdmi is back sd card reader is back magsafe is back
[1815.04 --> 1821.92]  why did they ever get rid of magsafe even if you could charge via usb type c magsafe should have stayed
[1822.48 --> 1826.96]  magsafe was so cool it was one of those things that even as a pc guy i looked at and i went
[1827.52 --> 1833.84]  i am so jealous that is so awesome i think everyone did yes yeah like like it was it was genuinely
[1833.84 --> 1840.00]  really cool you're one of the point where so many different cable companies ripped it off yeah because
[1840.00 --> 1845.84]  of because of the patents that are held by apple and microsoft they were one of the only two companies
[1845.84 --> 1851.92]  in the world that could ship laptops with these magnetic power connectors and they just refuse to
[1851.92 --> 1860.08]  do it because like no don't do that yeah so magsafe is back and i want to talk about ports
[1860.88 --> 1865.52]  who do you know who complained that ports are back i don't know if they want to be named right can i slap
[1865.52 --> 1875.12]  them no that would be employee abuse wait this is someone internal yeah name them their argument
[1876.72 --> 1884.40]  their their argument is that uh being an m1 mac user currently um
[1886.00 --> 1891.04]  i don't want to give too much information um they already have all the dongles and stuff that they
[1891.04 --> 1897.04]  need they had to buy all this stuff already they would prefer to have more usbc ports instead of
[1897.04 --> 1902.24]  the like hdmi or sd card or whatever they would rather replace those things with more usbc ports
[1902.24 --> 1908.48]  so they can continue the expandability of their laptop through the already current dongles that they own
[1913.12 --> 1917.52]  i don't agree with them if it helps because if they have those dongles it's not like they have no
[1917.52 --> 1923.44]  usbc ports yes and you can still expand by a lot with one dongle so if you have more than one you
[1923.44 --> 1928.56]  can expand by a huge amount having built-in hdmi is it a fantastic idea i probably wouldn't use the sd
[1928.56 --> 1933.36]  card slot a lot but i would use it sometimes and it's pretty annoying needing to go try to find a
[1933.36 --> 1938.80]  reader especially i mean either you use it a lot or you use it rarely and in both of those cases
[1939.76 --> 1945.36]  it's really annoying when it's not readily available yeah i'm trying to figure out who it is
[1947.52 --> 1951.44]  so you want everyone else's life to suck because your life sucks
[1953.60 --> 1957.04]  apparently he likes the hdmi and mag safe only has a problem with the sd
[1959.36 --> 1968.88]  i mean i actually do not entirely disagree that the sd card reader was the least necessary of those
[1968.88 --> 1976.40]  things to bring i do think too so i would argue a like appearance and and goal thing
[1977.36 --> 1983.12]  apple always kind of wanted to be the creator platform and i think over the last bit they've
[1983.12 --> 1990.24]  been letting that go slightly and i think maybe this is them trying to grab it back again this is
[1990.24 --> 1997.68]  them trying to like you know peace offering hey please please come back we really do care about you i
[1997.68 --> 2004.00]  would have rather had a type a port personally than an sd card slot um just there's so many peripherals and
[2004.00 --> 2009.28]  you just you just want to plug in like a mouse for two seconds i don't want to go dig another stupid
[2009.28 --> 2012.88]  thing out of my bag in fact i don't even want to carry another stupid thing around in my bag it would
[2012.88 --> 2019.84]  be really nice to to have a usb type a port that's that's what i would have preferred over an sd card
[2019.84 --> 2028.32]  slot and the reason for that i my justification for that is that outside of the photography space sd is
[2029.36 --> 2038.08]  not the be-all and end-all anymore um cfast is out there we've got cf express we've got uh red mags like
[2038.08 --> 2045.52]  there's there's all these different uh media standards and sd while it is still absolutely the
[2045.52 --> 2053.44]  standard when it comes to photography is not yeah it's it's not the end game anymore when it comes to
[2053.44 --> 2062.00]  uh to video recording so i uh i see where they're coming from i'd still rather have the sd card slot
[2062.00 --> 2068.00]  then not have it though so you don't want to smack them anymore uh oh i all right i won't smack them
[2068.00 --> 2078.08]  who is it it's jayden jayden jayden he had he has a good point sort of i i like the i like the type a
[2078.08 --> 2085.12]  argument a lot more and he did say in response he said 100 to the type a instead oh yeah i haven't been
[2085.12 --> 2089.84]  watching float plane chat it's me this is obvious no it wasn't it wasn't that obvious i actually don't
[2089.84 --> 2096.48]  know what mobile devices we have a fair number of mac users now jayden yeah like there's there's
[2096.48 --> 2103.84]  horst sarah lloyd off the top of my head uh jake daily drives a macbook not an m1 but like there
[2103.84 --> 2110.00]  that's that's four uh mark and andy are both heavy mac users so the two of our editors that is half a
[2110.00 --> 2115.04]  dozen people i have no idea what kind of computers like logistics uses i mean okay i know there's no way
[2115.04 --> 2119.76]  calinan uses a mac but i can understand when you're very port limited and one of them is
[2119.76 --> 2125.60]  a port that you will never use wishing that that port was something else i try i think the type a
[2125.60 --> 2131.44]  argument is is probably stronger than the another type c argument but i can kind of understand it to
[2131.44 --> 2137.28]  a little bit hdmi is not a waste i would rather plug hdmi directly into a computer than dongle it 100
[2137.28 --> 2143.68]  dongling it is a pain in the butt because it's something that i use all the time now let's talk it's
[2143.68 --> 2149.28]  also a heavy cable generally yes and it puts a lot of strain on a type c port yeah it's nice to have that
[2149.28 --> 2155.52]  nice secure and i'm really glad they went full-sized hdmi because mini hdmi and micro hdmi are both
[2155.52 --> 2163.84]  pieces of garbage um all right so hdmi 2.0 though hdmi 2.0 should this be acceptable in this day and age
[2166.40 --> 2170.16]  i thought that was pretty disappointing yeah i was pretty annoyed about that i'm gonna play devil's
[2170.16 --> 2174.72]  advocate and say i don't care it probably doesn't matter but i still don't think if you're buying a
[2174.72 --> 2179.60]  somewhat bleeding edge product that it should come with uh the previous generation of a connector so
[2179.60 --> 2188.08]  hdmi 2.0 is good for 4k 60 which is the only thing that you are realistically going to plug this computer
[2188.08 --> 2195.44]  into in a in a like professional work environment for the foreseeable future because if you wanted to go
[2196.08 --> 2205.44]  4k 120 or 5 or 6k or whatever you got your you know uh xdr display or whatever right so you want
[2205.44 --> 2210.24]  to plug into something else you're going to use one of your type c connectors you're not going to be using
[2210.24 --> 2216.08]  hdmi so it's not like the laptop doesn't have the capability of driving these higher resolution or
[2216.08 --> 2224.32]  higher refresh rate displays it's just that yeah you might need a special you might need a special cable for
[2224.32 --> 2230.56]  it or or something like that because it's not like there won't be thunderbolt or rather displayport
[2230.56 --> 2240.96]  to hdmi 2.1 dongles in fact i believe uh type c displayport to hdmi 2.1 i believe these already exist
[2242.16 --> 2252.88]  don't quote me on that 4k 120 hertz and 8k yep here it is so that was that was super easy to find
[2253.68 --> 2259.52]  and i think that if you are one of the very few people that is going to be driving a 4k 120 hertz
[2259.52 --> 2267.60]  display off of your macbook this is a fine solution for 38.99 that's canadian so it's like 30 bucks us
[2268.88 --> 2273.84]  there devil's advocate i think from a functionality perspective it's not going to matter to the vast
[2273.84 --> 2278.88]  majority of people you're a professor you do lectures or whatever you plug into your projection system
[2278.88 --> 2285.52]  i agree it just doesn't feel like complete or clean like i don't i don't understand why you
[2285.52 --> 2289.68]  would bother step it down i mean when it's already on such an expensive device like why not just give
[2289.68 --> 2294.40]  them the when it comes to display connectivity on this thing it's not the most incomplete thing
[2294.96 --> 2302.64]  that's fair let's talk about the notch oh oh now i've seen arguments a couple of different ways for the
[2302.64 --> 2307.84]  notch one of the ways that i've seen it is apple's got to make room for when they add face id okay that's a
[2307.84 --> 2314.48]  really really stupid argument yeah wow because of it yeah i mean no offense but you're an idiot no
[2314.48 --> 2322.72]  offense no offense but you're you're actually like defective because if the feature is not there then
[2322.72 --> 2330.08]  no they do not in fact need to leave room for it that's the worst that's the worst take ever okay but i
[2330.08 --> 2333.92]  have actually seen some pretty solid arguments for it so let me let me hit you with some of these
[2333.92 --> 2343.76]  things without the notch space it is a 16 by 10 display which is already great yes so everything
[2343.76 --> 2351.84]  to the left and the right of the notch is bonus and you should view it as such okay thoughts uh i feel
[2351.84 --> 2357.84]  like a lot of content is going to struggle with that notch um like what what if you full like that
[2358.48 --> 2361.28]  screwing with an aspect ratio doesn't mean that you have bonus screen space
[2361.28 --> 2366.64]  screen with an aspect ratio means that a lot of things are going to feel weird on your computer
[2368.48 --> 2373.84]  okay all right now now let me uh let me let me hit you again this is another of the more solid
[2373.84 --> 2379.60]  arguments that i've heard for the notch it happens to be exactly the number of pixels in height as the
[2379.60 --> 2386.80]  top bar on the mac something that you're basically stuck with except when you're viewing full screen content
[2386.80 --> 2394.16]  the vast majority of which will be 16 by 9 if we're talking about content consumption or even narrower
[2395.12 --> 2401.28]  so there there's another argument for that the notch is really not in the way it's just giving you
[2401.84 --> 2406.32]  extra bonus screen real estate that you otherwise wouldn't have
[2406.32 --> 2416.56]  um my thing is how how aesthetically unpleasing it is when i'm not watching something full screen
[2416.56 --> 2421.84]  uh i've i've used a decent amount of of phones with notches on them for to be completely honest a
[2421.84 --> 2427.92]  relatively short period of time um and when you full screen something especially if it would like black
[2427.92 --> 2432.96]  bar on the side or if it has a dark background it's not really that big of a problem but it's awkward
[2432.96 --> 2440.40]  and weird to use when i'm not doing that when i'm doing other things it like looks bad or or or whatever else
[2440.72 --> 2449.20]  that's my main complaint with notches so the best argument that i think i've heard and not the best in terms of um
[2449.76 --> 2455.60]  like the most carefully balanced you know oh people are mentioning that we need to point out that you
[2455.60 --> 2462.08]  have framework investment oh sure yes yes i'm invested in framework the best argument that i have heard
[2462.08 --> 2470.40]  for the notch is that for better or for worse apple and this is really a big part of where my initial
[2470.40 --> 2478.08]  discussion came from apple has clearly telegraphed that they are willing to put function before form
[2478.08 --> 2486.72]  yeah because it because it doesn't look good that was my whole yeah yeah because it looks terrible it
[2486.72 --> 2493.76]  looks really bad and they've someone there has to know that that it looks terrible and i think there's
[2493.76 --> 2498.96]  i think there's even more elegant ways to accomplish like you were saying it's so big because it it or
[2498.96 --> 2502.88]  you were mentioning that one of the arguments sorry was that it's so big that it has to accommodate
[2502.88 --> 2507.60]  face id or whatever which is yeah i mean we've you've said your opinion on that one and i agree
[2507.60 --> 2513.44]  um but there there's look at phones there's way more elegant ways to do it if they did like a punch
[2513.44 --> 2519.44]  hole thing i still would have not liked it yeah but it would have been more elegant it would have been
[2519.44 --> 2525.28]  a better solution instead of this like massive block which there's like no way they need that much space
[2526.08 --> 2531.92]  um i don't know yeah i mean lots of webcams are trash anyways to be i was almost wondering at a
[2531.92 --> 2539.52]  certain point when they would just leave the webcam behind no because too much of apple's product
[2539.52 --> 2545.84]  positioning is around connecting people okay and so a lot of what they i mean facetime is such a is
[2545.84 --> 2550.96]  such a big push for them over the last i mean when did facetime come out i can't even remember iphone 4s
[2550.96 --> 2557.36]  or something like that yeah i don't i don't remember anymore it was a long long time ago and honestly i i'm
[2557.36 --> 2562.16]  with them i think you've got to keep the webcam i do too i was just i i thought if someone would
[2562.16 --> 2565.84]  ditch it would be apple but i think you're right about the connecting people thing someone at flow
[2565.84 --> 2570.72]  plane chat or lazy elephant in full plane chat said is the webcam not getting better i believe it is
[2570.72 --> 2576.64]  getting better yep but if you hear the specs it sounds like it's getting better to like a 2008 standard
[2577.44 --> 2582.16]  well it depends right because if you want to compare against uh you know their laptop yeah you
[2582.16 --> 2589.44]  want to compare against dell's extremely high screen to bezel ratio just uh high screen to bezel ratio
[2589.44 --> 2597.20]  laptops it's um uh way better yeah it's it's genuinely difficult to get like nice high performance
[2597.20 --> 2603.28]  webcams in a bezel that is really small which is why i understand why they have this big blocky thing
[2603.28 --> 2608.80]  you know what i'm kind of surprised that no one's done like what i i mean you know maybe i wouldn't have
[2608.80 --> 2615.36]  preferred it maybe i would have criticized it um but maybe i would have preferred uh like a tab
[2617.60 --> 2624.40]  rather than have the entire laptop be completely rectangular have the webcam be a bump there's
[2624.40 --> 2630.48]  examples of that that's happened before um i think that was much more of a old school thing i think
[2630.48 --> 2636.56]  apple people would hate it you think so more than having a chunk out of your display it's not this like
[2636.56 --> 2642.08]  perfect clean neither is having a chunk out of your display i think if apple presented it as the best
[2642.08 --> 2648.08]  thing ever if we if if they accepted a notch in the display i don't see why they wouldn't accept a bump
[2648.08 --> 2653.92]  out of the display like i don't i i don't see the difference yeah i i think people wouldn't like it
[2653.92 --> 2659.84]  i i think messing with the the body and the external extent aesthetic of the computer would would
[2659.84 --> 2665.12]  because they're status symbol things right yeah but i guess i mean apple could probably find a way to
[2665.12 --> 2669.44]  make it so that like oh it's a status symbol to have the bump of course they could yeah i mean
[2669.44 --> 2673.36]  they managed to turn it into a status symbol to have a different color background on your stupid
[2673.36 --> 2680.08]  text messages i mean like let's get real here right it's it's not about what it is it's about what it
[2680.08 --> 2687.36]  represents and if what it represented was hey i've got the latest gen macbook that has this like
[2688.16 --> 2693.44]  banging you know awesome webcam in it or whatever i think they probably could have gotten away with that
[2693.44 --> 2698.56]  conrad says i like the notch think of it as giving you more screen area um rather than taking away
[2699.44 --> 2705.68]  a small area it's it's that's what linus was just saying though it's they're they're going for
[2705.68 --> 2710.00]  function over form yep absolutely because that argument is that argument is purely i'm getting
[2710.00 --> 2714.64]  more screen area which is which is fine and there is a positive argument for that but that's a very
[2714.64 --> 2720.40]  kind of not apple approach i mean except when you know they pulled the same thing with the iphone 10 and
[2720.40 --> 2723.92]  put a notch on that display i mean it's like there's clearly uh there's clearly a precedent for
[2723.92 --> 2731.36]  this yeah um there's other really good things about the display i mean it's got the same mini led back
[2731.36 --> 2736.72]  uh backlight as their other xdr screens or at least the same approach i haven't actually looked at
[2736.72 --> 2742.56]  exactly what the performance is like we're not hands-on with it yet but it looks freaking looks
[2742.56 --> 2748.88]  freaking awesome on paper uh it's got a high refresh rate uh it's got it's high refresh rate so it runs it up
[2748.88 --> 2754.48]  to 120 hertz and more importantly it seems to be adaptive anywhere from 24 to 120 hertz that's
[2754.48 --> 2763.68]  going to be great for battery life and for i mean dare i say it gaming on a mac hey they've got apple
[2763.68 --> 2769.52]  arcade there are games you can play on a mac games on your mac you could i was about to say you could
[2769.52 --> 2771.84]  you could run windows no you can't um
[2771.84 --> 2781.36]  um the ssds are up to 7.4 gigabytes per second that's utterly meaningless um other than just that
[2781.36 --> 2786.72]  it tells us they're running on pcie gen 4. it doesn't it doesn't actually tell us how the controller
[2786.72 --> 2792.80]  handles uh random transactions which is really more meaningful in terms of real world performance
[2792.80 --> 2796.72]  i had a good question in the float plane chat i've scrolled way past it now but
[2796.72 --> 2803.68]  um someone was like hey would you guys consider you know editing on m1 max and i think i think it
[2803.68 --> 2812.72]  was max max like the top end m1 max right yeah uh um already annoying editing on m1 max do you guys
[2812.72 --> 2820.56]  use pro res uh we are a premiere shop for the time being and right now we're shooting on sony so no we're
[2820.56 --> 2826.88]  not recording in pro res and i think we're going to be moving completely over to sony cameras the
[2826.88 --> 2832.64]  the performance especially in challenging lighting conditions is just outstanding so there would be
[2832.64 --> 2840.32]  there would be no reason for us to make a move right now like that um and at any rate we we would
[2840.32 --> 2847.20]  not be using notebooks for that we'd be waiting to see what apple comes out with for a desktop and i think
[2847.20 --> 2853.84]  the the entire professional community is waiting with bated breath to see where apple goes with
[2853.84 --> 2860.80]  the mac pro i'm i'm gonna come out and say i wouldn't actually be that surprised if they did
[2860.80 --> 2868.88]  one more generation of intel based mac pro cascade lake or excuse me cascade lake no not cascade lake
[2868.88 --> 2876.48]  sapphire rapids is the upcoming intel xeon architecture and the word on the street is that sapphire
[2876.48 --> 2883.60]  rapids is going to be pretty ballin so that would allow them to without doing a complete redesign
[2884.64 --> 2890.88]  release an updated mac pro that maintains compatibility for you know afterburner and
[2890.88 --> 2897.12]  whatever other whatever other workflows people have built around that particular machine yeah and and i i
[2897.12 --> 2902.16]  i wouldn't be too surprised either because i know galsinger is trying to make it a thing yeah um five days
[2902.16 --> 2908.80]  ago galsinger mentioned i i this isn't in the docs i don't i don't have this like perfectly in front of me
[2908.80 --> 2914.40]  pat galsinger intel ceo yes uh mentioned that he wants he wants intel back he wants me sorry apple
[2914.40 --> 2919.36]  back he wants to be working with apple i mean he got intel back he did yeah mission accomplished
[2919.36 --> 2927.12]  yeah round two good job everyone yeah pack it up we're going home we did it um but yeah he wants he wants
[2927.12 --> 2931.92]  apple back so um i mean they're kind of already going down the m1 line i don't think they're going
[2931.92 --> 2937.92]  to abandon that necessarily but um not immobile not anytime soon yeah but there's other options so
[2938.56 --> 2942.64]  oh people are freaking out over us changing cameras uh total wire says what happened to the black magic
[2942.64 --> 2950.80]  cameras honestly they're just the the footage is heavy um there's no clear image quality benefit
[2950.80 --> 2956.56]  going from 8k to 12k at least not on that sensor uh they don't perform well in low light uh we're
[2956.56 --> 2964.00]  just going with the reds uh recording to over usbc to ssds has been extremely flaky as for the reds we
[2964.00 --> 2969.44]  are going to hold on to two of our three reds uh two of our four reds we've got a v raptor we've got a
[2969.44 --> 2975.68]  dsmc2 we've got a weapon and we've got an epic w we are going to ditch the epic w and we're going to
[2975.68 --> 2980.88]  ditch the v raptor because we don't feel like acquiring new media um and we've got a ton of
[2980.88 --> 2985.84]  accessories for the old reds but i think that in terms of day-to-day shoots they're probably not
[2985.84 --> 2990.16]  going to see a lot of mileage anymore i mean we've got a ton of hours on those cameras they have
[2990.16 --> 2997.04]  absolutely they have served they've done some work extremely well and they're still going to continue
[2997.04 --> 3003.44]  to be useful because if we want to do something like a car shoot everyone everyone is set up for red
[3003.44 --> 3011.68]  dsmc2 which is the same body size and shape as the epic w and the weapon uh so when when we hire out
[3011.68 --> 3018.32]  a crew to man a camera car like we're going to put the red on it because we don't want to screw around
[3018.32 --> 3022.88]  you know um you don't want to waste everybody's time so we're gonna we're gonna hold on to two of
[3022.88 --> 3029.44]  our 8k reds one of which does 8k 60 it's not ditching fifty thousand dollars worth of cameras
[3029.44 --> 3033.52]  they both do 8k 60 yeah we're not they're not being ditched what someone's somebody's shout is
[3033.52 --> 3037.76]  like len is casually talking about uh ditching fifty thousand dollars worth of cameras like
[3037.76 --> 3043.04]  nah dude that's that's not how anything works i'm a selvin dog what do you think this is yeah
[3043.04 --> 3047.44]  yeah yeah no no no they're all i didn't even have to like know that it's just no way that's
[3047.44 --> 3051.44]  gonna be a thing they're all going up for sale yeah i think brandon wants to keep a black magic
[3051.44 --> 3057.44]  pocket around but i think that's gonna be that's gonna be the end yep so we're going uh fx
[3057.44 --> 3063.92]  fx6 i think is going to be our main workhorse fx6 sony i can't remember the models their models
[3063.92 --> 3070.56]  are confusing to me but basically it's the a7s3 sensor in a more flexible body with more io and
[3070.56 --> 3076.56]  more controls and all that kind of stuff we're going to have a an a7s3 or two and then i believe
[3076.56 --> 3082.16]  there's one other body size that uses a very similar sensor and they talked me into getting
[3082.16 --> 3086.08]  one of those or something i think i can't remember the exact details but we're going to
[3086.08 --> 3093.44]  come out not too far behind because um the sony's are are priced really well and there's a sort of
[3093.44 --> 3097.52]  camera shortage right now so we're going to be able to take advantage of that to get rid of some of
[3097.52 --> 3104.08]  our cameras at not as much of a loss as we would have would have had to take yeah so yeah at least
[3104.08 --> 3109.60]  we won't eat it too hard on some of those some of those mistakes that we made yeah uh do we want
[3109.60 --> 3114.40]  to finish off the apple stuff do you want to talk about airpods and home homepod mini anything like
[3114.40 --> 3119.52]  that yeah airpods third gen look great uh megsafe charging fixes one of the only problems i have
[3119.52 --> 3123.84]  with apple's wireless charging on their headphones just kind of i mean i don't have this problem
[3123.84 --> 3129.44]  because i'm actually using that um that put it anywhere you want pad that we got that was actually
[3129.44 --> 3132.96]  the first short circuit video i took it home because i was like this thing's great you just
[3132.96 --> 3139.76]  chuck it on it and it just charges um so i use i use that but if you're using a regular chi charging pad
[3139.76 --> 3144.16]  you kind of have to play around with it to get it in just the right spot and megsafe is great for
[3144.16 --> 3150.72]  that um i i like the shape i think the pro shape is way more comfortable than the airpods first and
[3150.72 --> 3156.16]  second gen shape um and the shape looks extremely similar maybe the same i haven't looked at that
[3156.16 --> 3161.76]  closely at it uh i'll definitely check them out i want to review them because as much as you'll pry
[3161.76 --> 3169.20]  my airpods pros from my cold dead hands um man that the active noise cancellation uh i'd be really
[3169.20 --> 3175.52]  interested to try out the new adaptive eq um longer battery life sounds great to be clear actually you
[3175.52 --> 3181.12]  know what i and again this is i gotta include some disclosure here because lg did sponsor the video
[3181.12 --> 3188.16]  about them but their latest tone freeze outstanding extremely comfortable i'd say that they are the
[3188.16 --> 3193.36]  closest thing to airpods pro comfort that i have yet encountered and the only reason that i haven't
[3193.36 --> 3199.04]  tried to daily drive them because they are a way better experience on android uh lg's app is not
[3199.04 --> 3205.68]  perfect but it's a lot better than the company basically uh maliciously going out of their way to
[3205.68 --> 3211.60]  make the product not as functional on your phone yeah um so i the only reason i'm not daily driving
[3211.60 --> 3216.48]  them is that ploof who was the writer for that video immediately after we stopped filming it was like
[3216.48 --> 3220.80]  wow you kind of sold me can i can i take these on like my trip i'm going on and try them i was like
[3220.80 --> 3226.72]  oh yeah i was going to take them but you sure i mean you did all the work so so i really want to try
[3226.72 --> 3231.84]  out the tone freeze again disclosure they sponsored the video on it but they're not sponsoring this um
[3231.84 --> 3236.96]  they sound really solid and they're extremely comfortable so i'm i'm really excited to see the
[3236.96 --> 3241.28]  new third gen airpods because they look like they're going to be really comfortable homepod mini who cares
[3241.28 --> 3248.96]  apple music uh oh yeah right the cheap voice plan so you can only use siri that sounds like the kind
[3248.96 --> 3256.24]  of thing that's just extremely broken really weird yeah if siri was so great why is it cheaper and why
[3256.24 --> 3262.64]  are you that's a really weird why are you inconveniencing your customer who pays you yeah
[3263.68 --> 3270.48]  it's a really really really awkward limitation if you can if you can afford to license the music like
[3270.48 --> 3274.16]  if you can afford to pay the licensing cost of the music to stream to this customer
[3275.04 --> 3280.40]  then at that price then shouldn't they just be able to listen to the music they want to listen to
[3281.76 --> 3288.96]  i've uh it's really odd yeah it's really odd almost as odd as if i were to forget to talk about our
[3288.96 --> 3294.80]  sponsors let's uh got them let's let's talk about let's talk about our sponsors for the wan show today
[3294.80 --> 3301.52]  we've got uh oh hold on a second who we got oh wait no this is not oh oh no this is not right
[3301.52 --> 3310.08]  sponsor frames here we go hey we're starting with corsair that's right corsair has a monitor now they
[3310.08 --> 3315.68]  recently launched their first gaming monitor the xenion and corsair i love you you're sponsoring this
[3315.68 --> 3320.80]  segment but what were you thinking with that name that's what we need that's what we need we need more
[3320.80 --> 3326.40]  things in the industry with a name super close to zeon um anyway their first good that doesn't
[3326.40 --> 3335.04]  mean the product is a problem so it's an ultra slim 32 inch qhd ips panel qhd really is in my opinion the
[3335.04 --> 3341.68]  optimal resolution for a gaming monitor right now uh gets you nice high refresh rate so it's 165 hertz
[3341.68 --> 3348.48]  refresh rate um but without the noticeable pixelation that you'd get from a 1080p panel it's got quantum dot
[3348.48 --> 3355.52]  with 100 coverage of srgb adobe rgb and then 98 coverage of the dcip3 color space uh that's for
[3355.52 --> 3360.40]  more vivid natural colors and you can mount your camera mic or lighting with an integrated multi-mount
[3360.40 --> 3364.56]  point that's built right into the aluminum stand so you can learn more at the link in the video
[3364.56 --> 3375.84]  description that's lmg.gg xenion man on on their on their page for this monitor they have uh they have
[3375.84 --> 3380.08]  someone playing a racing game with a mouse and keyboard come on hold on can i wait they do yeah
[3380.56 --> 3384.00]  uh hold on can you show me this i don't think corsair has controllers maybe that's why
[3385.28 --> 3389.28]  they do they own scuff oh yeah why isn't he using a scuff controller guys
[3389.92 --> 3394.40]  what's going on you know what it probably is is it's probably a green screened game yeah it's it's
[3394.40 --> 3401.04]  probably put something that isn't a racing game i mean because this guy's very convincingly game okay
[3401.04 --> 3405.60]  hold on hold on maybe this is supposed to be i'm you know what i'm going devil's advocate here
[3405.60 --> 3409.84]  maybe this is supposed to be more of like an open world exploration game where the character happened
[3409.84 --> 3413.84]  to get into a car you ever think of that smart guy maybe there's a shooting element plugged in
[3414.72 --> 3418.56]  oh who does that i do that you're such a nerd yeah
[3420.96 --> 3426.48]  and the show is also brought to you by ridge wallet stop carrying around pointless items in your
[3426.48 --> 3431.76]  pocket like receipts old hotel room keys or spent gift cards ridge wallet helps you carry less it's
[3431.76 --> 3438.72]  a two metal plate elastic band wallet that keeps your cards tightly together but still easily accessible
[3438.72 --> 3444.32]  it's rfid blocking it's got a lifetime guarantee and it's available in aluminum carbon fiber and
[3444.32 --> 3449.28]  titanium so you can get like the super these super sick finished ones that look freaking awesome
[3449.28 --> 3453.52]  and they don't just sell wallets they've got battery banks bags smartphone covers and more and if you
[3453.52 --> 3459.92]  use offer code when you can get 10 off everything at ridge.com slash when finally the show is brought
[3459.92 --> 3465.20]  to you by ultium thank you ultium for sponsoring today's video ultium designer enables engineers to
[3465.20 --> 3470.24]  connect with every facet of the electronics design process wait a minute i know ultium have we worked
[3470.24 --> 3477.12]  with these guys before uh i did not recognize the name on the docs yeah oh man their stuff is sick
[3477.12 --> 3483.28]  uh hold on a second you know what i i think i was on their blog uh the other just the other day
[3483.52 --> 3484.16]  hold on
[3486.72 --> 3496.72]  uh ultium blog ddr5 i think it was their blog uh apparently it's not a blog
[3498.16 --> 3504.64]  it's it looks like a blog and it smells like a blog but uh it's not called a blog it's called
[3504.64 --> 3511.52]  resources.altium.com super cool so i was looking at uh actually yeah i think it was exactly this article
[3511.52 --> 3518.72]  that's just a good look into what some of the challenges are with uh getting clean signals
[3519.28 --> 3528.48]  on ddr5 memory modules because of the extremely high um high signaling speeds so yeah that's uh wow
[3528.48 --> 3532.96]  that's that's super cool apparently they're a sponsor of the wan show now so ultium designer enables
[3532.96 --> 3537.84]  engineers to connect with every facet of the electronics design process it's intuitive you can
[3537.84 --> 3542.56]  interact in a 3d environment it features interactive routing uh this is not in my talking points but it
[3542.56 --> 3547.12]  allows you to run simulations to see if you're going to run into uh interference problems before
[3547.12 --> 3552.96]  you've even built a board uh you can they've got ultium 365 which allows multiple people to work on the
[3552.96 --> 3557.36]  same project at once you get a kind of free trial today at the link in the video there's some there's
[3557.36 --> 3564.40]  some people in in full plane chat being like whoa what i use this at work that's cool yeah that's awesome
[3564.40 --> 3570.56]  uh no no jerky eating today unfortunately savage jerky is not a sponsor today man i'm you know what
[3570.56 --> 3576.32]  i i am so i'm not supposed to eat the jerky that they send me except on on stream but i was i was like
[3576.32 --> 3581.12]  gaming the other night i was just like i mowed down an entire pack of the maple buffalo bacon which
[3581.12 --> 3586.56]  speaking of the linux challenge i don't know if you saw my my steam message last night what no i didn't
[3587.20 --> 3592.32]  there's another so okay so we've we've brought up that not only do i i probably game significantly more
[3592.32 --> 3597.12]  than linus yeah so i spend more time on it oh you're not gonna go after me for this are you that's so
[3597.12 --> 3603.68]  stupid i also work on it but i'm not going after you for it you're going after the fact that you're
[3603.68 --> 3608.00]  bringing it up means you're going after me for it linus has a separate computer that he plays vr
[3608.00 --> 3614.08]  games on what would you have i can't play vr games what would you have me do what would you have me do
[3614.08 --> 3623.12]  i would i would no no no you don't get to turn this around what would you have me do you got to
[3623.12 --> 3631.12]  take a month off what okay look beat saber is part of my exercise regimen seriously i'm not even okay
[3631.12 --> 3639.52]  okay so would you have me okay my lighthouses are literally wired into my attic space they are under 18
[3639.52 --> 3646.72]  inches of blown cellulose insulation now all the wiring for it what would you have me do do i have
[3646.72 --> 3653.36]  to move them why no what do you mean why do you would have you seen my personal gaming machine would
[3653.36 --> 3658.88]  you have me carry it downstairs you could you could wire that one you could uh reformat your your media
[3658.88 --> 3666.56]  center pc to linux i don't actually want you to i just wanted to complain i don't want i don't actually
[3666.56 --> 3673.60]  want anything to change i was streaming beat saber last night from yes my windows media center pc
[3673.60 --> 3680.16]  that is hooked up i was streaming because streaming is it actually incentivizes me to go for longer
[3680.16 --> 3685.76]  having the chat to interact with keeps me going they request songs and stuff like that and so it it
[3685.76 --> 3694.16]  it kind of it keeps me motivated to keep playing i do not think that that was an entirely unreasonable
[3694.16 --> 3699.20]  thing for me to do and it's the first time that i've actually even no it's the second time i've
[3699.20 --> 3705.44]  played it's the first time i've streamed i was not going to be like playing a different game otherwise
[3706.08 --> 3710.80]  by the way we this is the first week that we haven't managed to film a part of the challenge
[3710.80 --> 3718.08]  um i wanted to propose something to you can we change it up and do the do regular stuff one next week
[3718.08 --> 3721.44]  rather than to get all the game launchers working one because i think we're both probably farther
[3721.44 --> 3726.08]  along on that one i know you're farther along on the game launchers one but i'm not i'm like done
[3726.08 --> 3733.52]  that one yeah so can we do the like perform regular tasks one first because i've spent most of my time
[3734.24 --> 3738.40]  screwing around with that doing regular tasks far less of my time actually playing games in fact
[3739.04 --> 3743.60]  if i had a gaming addiction i think one of the best things that i could do for myself is install linux
[3745.28 --> 3750.32]  because it turns it into such a chore to get it working that it's like yeah it honestly does take
[3750.32 --> 3755.60]  some of the fun out of it yeah um there's also like lots of other problems that are be clear
[3755.60 --> 3763.44]  i have not put a ton of time into solving some of these problems yet so once i do it is entirely
[3763.44 --> 3768.72]  possible that you guys will see you guys will hear an entirely different tune from me when part three or
[3768.72 --> 3773.84]  four whatever it ends up being rolls around and and also to be clear our stories are quite different
[3776.00 --> 3779.60]  we've had we've had very different experiences there will be some similar threads there will be some
[3779.60 --> 3788.56]  similar threads 100 percent um i might be distro hopping really yep i've considered it already i but
[3788.56 --> 3795.76]  i've i've already invested so much that's the into like yeah i don't want to manjaro things yeah and
[3795.76 --> 3805.04]  i've already i've already set up so many things on manjaro but then if i then have to not only figure out
[3805.04 --> 3810.64]  how to do one another distro i even just have to figure out how to do them again like i'm i'm getting
[3810.64 --> 3815.68]  to the point where i'm kind of comfortable when i need to install an application i can either use um
[3816.80 --> 3822.64]  pamac which is their which is their like graphical user interface version or for whatever reason i can't
[3822.64 --> 3829.36]  find it through pamac i know how to use pacman i know how to override the by default blocked arch user
[3829.36 --> 3836.24]  repository i know how to go get things from there like i've like i've kind of kind of figured out
[3836.24 --> 3842.08]  how to use my computer i really don't want to start over one of my things and i don't want to start over
[3842.08 --> 3848.08]  either one of my things is i've shown you i've complained to you and shown you at least once
[3848.08 --> 3856.08]  my windows lagging problem right yeah i finally was like i have to solve this i'm so tired of this
[3856.08 --> 3861.52]  because part of it was like i just started using um like maximize and minimize and stuff like that
[3861.52 --> 3865.92]  to move windows around more and snapping so that i wouldn't drag them because it was like actually
[3865.92 --> 3869.44]  just driving me nuts but it got to the point where i was like sometimes you just have to drag things
[3870.00 --> 3873.68]  and it's really annoying when it just lags all over the place and it's like genuinely a horrible
[3873.68 --> 3881.20]  experience so i dove into it it's been an open issue on my desktop environment since 2013.
[3886.08 --> 3894.56]  so i i think i have to go i cannot stay here it is not home i must leave so i think i have to like
[3894.56 --> 3902.00]  redo basically everything well i'm sorry to hear that yeah yeah because there's still like more than
[3902.00 --> 3906.08]  two weeks left in the challenge like there's a lot of well that's my whole thing is like am i going to
[3906.08 --> 3913.76]  deal with this windows lagging issue that i know i can't fix yeah for a really long time genuinely and
[3913.76 --> 3921.68]  like i i don't i don't think so no all right some and i i i've seen some comments uh in in floatplane
[3921.68 --> 3928.56]  chat about it and i saw some comments about this online i have a really overly powerful computer
[3929.20 --> 3939.04]  it's not that it's really not that yeah aren't you running like a 2080 ti uh uh titan rtx so yeah okay
[3939.04 --> 3947.20]  so better than a 2080 ti and a ryzen 5950x tons of ram that is it's on an nvme drive that is
[3947.20 --> 3952.32]  literally as good as it gets every application loads directly off the nvme drive that linux is
[3952.32 --> 3958.88]  installed on yeah okay like it's people are saying switching desktop environments isn't too hard
[3958.88 --> 3969.68]  it's just tedious yeah i don't think it'll be hard either i've had a bunch of different um jaden
[3969.68 --> 3974.08]  even pointed out i'm using a different distro deluke and i have uh the same windows lagging issue
[3974.08 --> 3980.16]  i i looked into it yeah this is very prevalent right this is a lot more than just dozens of
[3980.16 --> 3988.80]  people with this problem yeah um i even uh i i yeah i've looked into it fair amount there's uh
[3988.80 --> 3992.64]  just fix the issue yourself that is a linux thing but it hasn't been fixed since 2013 so i don't think
[3992.64 --> 3996.88]  i'm gonna give a shot at it because there's a lot better people that i'm sure have looked at it um
[3997.76 --> 4003.52]  oh man it's it's yeah it's it's it's on a lot more distros than this one with a lot more desktop
[4003.52 --> 4008.16]  environments in this one there's there's two that i'm kind of looking into right now um i haven't
[4008.16 --> 4013.28]  decided yet but we'll figure it out all right man we've actually got a lot more stuff that i wanted
[4013.28 --> 4020.40]  to talk about today did you see that uh carmac apparently pushed for an unlocked version of what
[4020.40 --> 4025.28]  what was it like what is it like the os or firmware i actually i only skimmed the article this morning
[4025.28 --> 4031.76]  when i was still groggy but i just i just thought it was super cool because the oculus go doesn't have
[4031.76 --> 4039.12]  to become complete e-waste the second that facebook servers stop um you know providing updates for it
[4039.12 --> 4045.04]  or or stop making the store accessible to it like you know something like the original nintendo wii
[4045.04 --> 4049.60]  you know when you lost access to the nintendo store it's like oh well that sucks what if i just like
[4049.60 --> 4054.56]  wanted to buy more content how hard could it possibly have been to keep maintaining this store
[4055.36 --> 4061.60]  i mean it's not like the hardware is changing yeah so you could have just left it on a on a computer
[4061.60 --> 4066.88]  in a corner somewhere like or or you know you could take an approach like this where you let the
[4066.88 --> 4073.28]  community take over this is so cool this is the first thing that oculus facebook ever since the
[4073.28 --> 4081.60]  acquisition has done that i went and that i go and look at i will go wow this is so cool like
[4082.40 --> 4087.36]  as we wrote when nintendo oh wow this is funny ars technica even talked about um nintendo shutting
[4087.36 --> 4092.32]  down the online servers for wii and nintendo ds back in 2014 there's no reason that continued
[4092.32 --> 4096.32]  online support for these consoles should be at the whim of a company that obviously has no financial
[4096.32 --> 4102.88]  interest in them anymore exactly exactly they should take steps to release versions of their server code
[4102.88 --> 4106.56]  that allow players to run their own online infrastructure after the corporate servers are no
[4106.56 --> 4112.88]  longer available because this is going to destroy entire generations of not just gaming experiences
[4112.88 --> 4119.84]  but of computing experiences like you can still go back and you can experience a commodore 64 the way
[4119.84 --> 4127.36]  that it was experienced back in the 1980s you can still do that you cannot go back and experience
[4127.36 --> 4134.40]  a gaming machine like even even going back to windows xp like the fact that so many of the gaming
[4134.40 --> 4140.24]  services were online like you can't install steam on it anymore there are games you might have bought
[4140.24 --> 4148.00]  that you can no longer run on the computer you bought them on yeah we're losing not not just you
[4148.00 --> 4154.80]  know freedom as consumers we're losing experiences we're losing history here and this is a this is a huge
[4154.80 --> 4161.36]  issue in in gaming it's it's the most obvious i think in the mmo space sorry it's the most obvious in
[4161.36 --> 4167.76]  the mmo space oh 100 because the second an mmo goes down it's it's all gone yep forever unless unless
[4167.76 --> 4173.20]  like a pirated community version comes online but a lot of times those are missing certain missing a lot
[4173.20 --> 4179.68]  of things because they're they're usually trying to reverse engineer so they have to kind of guess how
[4179.68 --> 4186.08]  certain mechanics worked in a lot of cases they like a lot of the player impact uh whether there there was
[4186.08 --> 4193.12]  really any or not um is is now gone like there's there's a lot of issues with it um so i'd like
[4193.12 --> 4200.24]  this is cool honestly i'd like to see it a be a legal requirement if the only way to access your service
[4200.24 --> 4209.04]  that your customer buys that they pay for is through uh an online an online server that that they run if
[4209.04 --> 4213.52]  they shut it down you have to publish it they need to publish it that'd be really cool i would be
[4214.64 --> 4220.08]  very enthusiastically in support of of whatever that law is i mean i'm sure if you're someone like
[4220.08 --> 4225.12]  uh like an ea for example we can actually use this to transition into one of our other topics
[4225.12 --> 4231.60]  you might not be super happy about that because why would people buy fifa 2021 if they could just
[4232.24 --> 4239.52]  keep playing fifa 2020 or 2019 or 2018 or 2012 for that matter like if they if they don't really
[4239.52 --> 4245.04]  care about the roster updates and certain people will but there's definitely going to be a financial
[4245.04 --> 4251.36]  risk to that kind of annual update business model if people can just continue to play the old games on
[4251.36 --> 4256.32]  community servers and not have to deal with the the crap that comes along with playing it off of va's
[4256.32 --> 4262.40]  what about dealing with um i just i feel like we should dive down this topic a little bit sure
[4262.40 --> 4266.80]  um because it's i i think i immediately jumped in support of that and i'm still in support of it but
[4266.80 --> 4272.56]  i think there's some interesting problems in the modern world uh like transactions sure because you're
[4272.56 --> 4278.40]  still losing content whether you're for that content or not i i think a lot of people especially in the
[4278.40 --> 4283.12]  mmo space when you have to buy the game up front and then you have to pay a subscription there's a lot of
[4283.12 --> 4287.36]  friction there's a lot of people that don't like the fact that there's also digital content stores
[4287.36 --> 4292.96]  in pretty much all of those games um but there's also games that aren't mmos that are server-based
[4292.96 --> 4299.36]  that have like either microtransactions or something else yeah how do you solve that because
[4300.88 --> 4307.04]  that would probably take the company developing a system that then makes those way better because
[4307.04 --> 4312.24]  you'd probably have to make it some form of like in-game reward which is what people want anyways so
[4312.24 --> 4318.08]  they have to like improve the game or they'd have to hand over the keys to this this transaction
[4318.08 --> 4324.00]  engine so that some third party is now making money i mean honestly that's an interesting model
[4324.96 --> 4331.12]  so basically what you do is you then say okay we're not going to support this game ourselves anymore
[4331.76 --> 4337.68]  but you have some kind of um reasonable and you'd probably have to mandate this
[4337.68 --> 4342.32]  uh but you have some kind of reasonable split and someone else can take up the mantle
[4342.72 --> 4348.80]  and you know so you have to share your like income records or whatever yeah or what with the yeah or
[4348.80 --> 4354.24]  you have to or you have to license it or whatever the case may be but but basically you could you could
[4354.24 --> 4359.36]  create i think you could create a legal framework for this that goes okay uh it could provide a number
[4359.36 --> 4364.80]  of different options but at the end of the day what it falls to is you have to license it to someone and it
[4364.80 --> 4370.72]  turns into like a reverse auction so it turns into more like a consignment like a consignment store so
[4370.72 --> 4375.36]  you price it at whatever and then if no one will take it you keep going down down down down down down
[4375.36 --> 4380.64]  down down until someone agrees to say okay yeah yeah yeah we'll do it for that and so you get these kind
[4380.64 --> 4386.80]  of tier two uh tier two gaming companies that are ultimately kind of maintaining these older games
[4387.28 --> 4393.68]  uh i i think it could work i think i'm sure there's problems we haven't thought of but it sounds super cool to me
[4393.68 --> 4397.68]  i'm sure there's a thousand problems that we haven't thought of and one of the biggest problems
[4397.68 --> 4403.28]  that we haven't brought up is that you would need lawmakers that actually understand the issues at play
[4403.28 --> 4413.84]  and that's clearly not a thing um with the with the number of of not just boomers but like aging boomers
[4413.84 --> 4418.96]  who just clearly have no idea what's going on in this high-tech world that we all live in
[4418.96 --> 4424.16]  uh that are that are in positions of power these days we're going to get into something related to
[4424.16 --> 4430.48]  that in a moment but first let's talk about i used ea and fifa as an example for a specific reason and
[4430.48 --> 4438.64]  that's because um that relationship might be coming to an end that's right one of if not the most
[4438.64 --> 4443.76]  financially successful game licenses might soon be up for grabs because the current contract between
[4443.76 --> 4449.36]  ea and fifa ends in 2022 yeah if you're just before you keep going if you're not a sports gamer
[4449.36 --> 4455.44]  which um i find a lot of people either basically only play sports games and maybe racing games yeah
[4455.44 --> 4460.08]  or they they don't play those pretty much at all or maybe just racing games kind of float in between
[4460.08 --> 4467.68]  um but fifa makes an incredible amount of money on microtransactions um and there's some really
[4467.68 --> 4472.16]  interesting content online about that so maybe something to jump into so the partnership started in the
[4472.16 --> 4478.72]  early 90s with fifa international soccer on the sega mega drive um new york times claims talks have
[4478.72 --> 4484.48]  stalled between the two to continue the relationship fifa reportedly wants more than double the cut that
[4484.48 --> 4490.96]  they were receiving before fifa the more than double the cut they were receiving before fifa 21 apparently
[4490.96 --> 4501.28]  generated 1.34 billion in revenue for fiscal q4 fiscal q4 that's a single quarter this is a five billion
[4501.28 --> 4508.96]  dollar a year business wow now to put this in perspective ea's full year revenue
[4508.96 --> 4520.32]  was wait a second yeah this is this seems to be confused so hold on a second uh fifa 2021 revenue ea
[4520.32 --> 4524.32]  hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on uh in its fiscal q4
[4524.32 --> 4534.56]  okay apparently uh this article that uh was the sort of the source here made a mistake
[4536.24 --> 4549.20]  maybe they mean at the start of q4 for the year it was 1.34 yeah i'm not sure this is very um confusing
[4549.20 --> 4558.72]  ea's full year revenue reached 5.6 billion 29 of that total came from ultimate team modes uh
[4559.60 --> 4566.88]  full year oh wait hold on a second okay yeah i think something got lost in translation a little bit
[4566.88 --> 4576.64]  so full year revenue um for like uh ultimate team mode wait what okay you know what i have no idea the
[4576.64 --> 4582.32]  point is fifa generates a ton of money billions um and it's a massive percentage of their their
[4582.32 --> 4587.36]  their take them but yeah whatever fifa ultimate team buy packs get player cards make a team whatever
[4587.36 --> 4595.28]  the point is if this deal if a deal isn't reached don't expect a fifa game anytime soon because it'll
[4595.28 --> 4600.00]  kind of take a minute to make a brand new soccer game from scratch although they could partner with
[4600.00 --> 4607.68]  konami or 2k uh who both have soccer games or european football football soccer not american
[4607.68 --> 4612.40]  football i don't know whatever i'm not gonna get i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get into that um
[4613.04 --> 4620.88]  all right let's get into this whole situation where the missouri governor vows to prosecute the f12 key
[4620.88 --> 4625.84]  this is going nowhere hit me luke let's do it okay let's talk about this missouri governor mike
[4625.84 --> 4632.72]  parson parson probably is vowing to prosecute the st louis post dispatch after the newspaper
[4632.72 --> 4637.60]  uncovered a security vulnerability on the department it actually really is one on the
[4637.60 --> 4645.12]  department of elementary and secondary education or the dese website the vulnerability social security
[4645.12 --> 4652.40]  numbers were being included in the source for pages served by the uh teacher credentials lookup portal
[4652.40 --> 4661.60]  horrible super bad massive vulnerability uh the governor described decoding the html source code
[4664.16 --> 4670.00]  a bit bit of a interesting phrasing there uh to find this info as a multi-step criminal process
[4670.64 --> 4680.24]  wow i'm going to jail uh referring indirectly to a browser's inspect element or view source function
[4680.24 --> 4686.40]  uh which is you know built into every single browser and is how the internet works um yeah big
[4686.40 --> 4693.68]  big rough one there uh therefore the state of missouri has declared war um on the f12 key the governor
[4693.68 --> 4701.04]  followed up with a tweet saying that it wasn't a simple right click uh attaching screenshots of missouri
[4701.04 --> 4708.32]  law rather than actually substantiating this claim in any way shape or form um just in case you don't know
[4708.32 --> 4714.48]  html is what is sent to your browser to inform your browser of how to do things it is public it is
[4714.48 --> 4718.96]  interpreted by your browser that is why things like adblock and whatnot other stuff can kind of work
[4718.96 --> 4722.64]  because it is interpretation of what is sent to you that's why things can look different on different
[4722.64 --> 4730.56]  browsers etc etc etc um it's uh yeah the server should not be sending this info to begin with we're
[4730.56 --> 4737.44]  talking about the the social social security numbers um it it shouldn't be sent in in any way shape or
[4737.44 --> 4744.32]  form obfuscated or not encrypted or not doesn't matter it that that should not be sent like you i
[4744.32 --> 4752.08]  don't i don't want the encryption key for my social security number to be sent uh in through html on
[4752.08 --> 4756.72]  someone's web page that would be that would be really stupid that'd be horrible even if it's encrypted
[4757.28 --> 4763.12]  just why anthony's discussion questions on this are amazing how far could this go seeing as governor
[4763.12 --> 4772.40]  parsons seems to be doubling down on being an out of touch um luddite um can html source code provided
[4772.40 --> 4778.80]  by a web server ever be considered private information could this be legislated it's a good question too
[4778.80 --> 4784.64]  and perhaps most importantly should journalists be prosecuted for discovering vulnerabilities
[4784.64 --> 4790.96]  and disclosing them to the public it's like it's like an author putting someone's like social security
[4790.96 --> 4795.52]  number in the index of a book and then being like you're not supposed to look there don't look at
[4795.52 --> 4800.80]  that that's illegal that's illegal i don't know you don't have permission this is ridiculous there's no
[4800.80 --> 4808.48]  way this goes anywhere i i can't believe he doubled down um i can't believe why are you surprised by this
[4810.00 --> 4816.56]  like in politics there's basically two ways of behaving one is you acknowledge you made a mistake
[4816.56 --> 4824.72]  and fix it and the other is to do what politicians do double down you double down make some drama i mean
[4824.72 --> 4830.48]  to be clear not all not all and i'm i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get into any kinds of generalizations
[4830.48 --> 4836.80]  but it doesn't surprise me that much yeah is what i'll say about that disappointing hopefully if this if
[4836.80 --> 4840.88]  this goes any further than it has already gone it gets immediately thrown out by someone within with
[4840.88 --> 4847.52]  an ounce of reason um can i just say that i am determined to not be this out of touch to my kids
[4848.80 --> 4856.72]  like i will not accept it yeah it takes some takes some action though right like especially um
[4858.00 --> 4862.80]  when you get to the point of retiring like there's that whole thing about where people a lot of people's
[4862.80 --> 4868.48]  health just like tanks the second they retire because they just stop doing anything they stop thinking
[4868.48 --> 4874.40]  about anything yeah they just like shut down and the humans don't really work that well in that
[4874.40 --> 4879.52]  environment so you just got to keep doing stuff my mom um i don't know if she's watching this is
[4879.52 --> 4885.52]  taking an it course that's pretty cool that's great and she's like actually doing pretty okay she published a
[4885.52 --> 4894.80]  website i love it it's pretty simple but it's there it's cool she knows more about html code than this guy
[4894.80 --> 4900.40]  nice oh yeah all right
[4903.20 --> 4906.88]  man that almost felt like a regular show reference did you ever watch regular show
[4907.76 --> 4913.12]  no okay there's this character muscle man and his hit his punchline for like every joke is instead of
[4913.12 --> 4918.88]  your mom it's my mom it's like you know who knows html code better than this governor my mom
[4918.88 --> 4927.60]  yeah pretty much all right as if we needed more reasons uh we have another one to hate drm on
[4927.60 --> 4937.44]  games oh nice it looks like alder lake may have incompatibility issues with older drm protected
[4937.44 --> 4944.16]  games oh my goodness this totally makes sense intel's developer guide states oh that the problem is that
[4944.16 --> 4951.12]  older games that are no longer actively being patched include drm that may get confused by their
[4951.12 --> 4957.68]  big little architecture because some drm uses cpu detection as part of its routines and big little
[4957.68 --> 4962.24]  is going to be confusing to it and if you've been following the wan show for a long time you'll know
[4962.24 --> 4968.56]  that denuvo um and and some other ones but definitely denuvo does that and to a big degree
[4968.56 --> 4975.92]  so yep makes sense so there's some questions here could we possibly get around this with a
[4975.92 --> 4982.40]  virtualized like uh like a virtual like a kind of a transparent to the user hey let's quickly pass
[4982.40 --> 4987.60]  through all of our hardware to a vm except not efficiency cores because they're confusing could we
[4987.60 --> 4992.64]  run this in like a a compatibility mode is that something that you know microsoft and intel could
[4992.64 --> 4998.48]  work together on uh that seems possible i think so but you'd have to get nvidia to play ball
[4998.72 --> 5005.76]  they would have to allow uh gpu pass through in that way and i suspect that they won't do it
[5005.76 --> 5012.00]  because the second they allow that you're gonna have people using it as a workaround to finally
[5012.00 --> 5017.36]  get proper gpu virtualization working on consumer cards it is kind of a way that that people have
[5017.36 --> 5022.08]  gotten around things in the past though you can emulate different types of hardware so um well it
[5022.08 --> 5028.16]  wouldn't be emulation it would be uh nvidia allowing their gpu cores to be sliced up in the
[5028.16 --> 5032.32]  same way that cpu cores now they only allow it on there you can also do with emulation but you'd
[5032.32 --> 5036.00]  lose like an incredible amount of performance so it wouldn't be a thing if it's only older games it
[5036.00 --> 5042.80]  might be okay eventually eventually yeah i think this would be a really really tough thing to do in
[5042.80 --> 5047.20]  in the near future yeah i mean you can emulate actually you know what that might be that might be
[5047.20 --> 5052.24]  a pretty good answer because you can emulate old cpus already but you wouldn't even have to emulate the
[5052.24 --> 5057.60]  cpu because your cpu you could just pass through you could use virtualization for the cpu and then
[5057.60 --> 5066.56]  you could emulate the functionality of the gpu which might be somewhat easier to do my understanding
[5066.56 --> 5072.72]  is cpu emulation is more difficult but okay don't quote me on that i don't know yeah in fact i'd love
[5072.72 --> 5076.24]  it if there are some developers in the audience that could that could help point us in the right
[5076.24 --> 5081.28]  direction on that anyone on floatplane chat uh luke's gonna be uh checking on it i'll see it for the next
[5081.28 --> 5086.88]  little bit here uh there's a couple more discussion points here intel is apparently working with drm
[5086.88 --> 5091.36]  providers such as denuvo to ensure these new platforms are supported so that'll be great for
[5091.36 --> 5097.52]  newer titles that are still being patched by their developers but there is no telling what's gonna
[5097.52 --> 5104.08]  happen to older games uh so probably gonna get abandoned is it gonna be worth upgrading to alder lake
[5104.08 --> 5110.08]  if it means that you can't easily play a bunch of your older games should the drm for these titles
[5110.08 --> 5116.72]  simply be turned off okay well that's the obvious answer yes yes yeah and that has happened we know
[5116.72 --> 5123.12]  it's possible yeah it's 100 possible i mean like gog is evidence that that is totally possible and
[5123.12 --> 5129.04]  totally a thing according to leaks from microcenter pricing and specs for the core i9 12 900k are as
[5129.04 --> 5135.60]  follows 16 cores so eight performance eight efficient 24 threads so that's two per performance core and only
[5135.60 --> 5143.60]  one per efficiency core 3.2 gigahertz base 5.2 gigahertz turbo 30 megs of level 3 cache 125 watt
[5143.60 --> 5154.00]  thermal power we'll see uh ddr4 3200 or ddr5 4800 and coming in at 669 dollars nice that's a lot of money
[5154.00 --> 5160.72]  that's that part's not nice but you know the number is nice yeah you know what else is nice ltt store hey
[5160.72 --> 5166.40]  finally has gift cards yeah that's right my friends there's no way sarah didn't do this artwork
[5166.40 --> 5176.08]  you can get ltt gift cards in various denominations 10 25 50 dollars a hundred dollars i love that it
[5176.08 --> 5185.36]  looks like a mouse pad and 250 dollars that's right give the gift of lttstore.com to your loved ones today
[5185.36 --> 5194.96]  at ltdstore.com slash products slash gift card hey pretty cool all right yeah um you know what there
[5194.96 --> 5200.24]  was that story that i said on the pre-show that i was going to tell about how it feels like people take
[5200.24 --> 5207.68]  my on-camera persona like when i will when i will tease someone or when i will get angry about something
[5208.24 --> 5214.72]  extremely seriously sometimes and to the point where i kind of feel like there's some people in our
[5214.72 --> 5222.08]  viewership that cannot tell the difference between um video content that they're watching
[5222.08 --> 5230.00]  and reality and an example of this is i was looking back at one of our videos recently it was on wake up
[5230.00 --> 5237.60]  tech so it was five gadgets designed to help you wake up and one of the things that happens in that video
[5237.60 --> 5242.56]  is do you remember how we got on this subject like what it was that someone was mad about that i was sort
[5242.56 --> 5247.44]  of confused by like obviously this was a thing that was not real but they were super mad about it i
[5247.44 --> 5251.36]  think it was something in the pre-show but no i don't remember yeah i can't remember anyway the point
[5251.36 --> 5258.88]  is um there was a comment on this video oh oh you said you were a genius oh yeah yeah yeah right right
[5258.88 --> 5265.60]  right the number of people that hear me say things like that and you know hear you say well i know you
[5265.60 --> 5270.88]  always told me you're a genius so i just assumed you were you know like the number of people that seem to
[5270.88 --> 5279.68]  take comments like that and interpret them as how i actually feel and how you actually feel it just
[5279.68 --> 5284.16]  it blows my mind what do you mean i do feel that way like communication is is not literal right like
[5284.16 --> 5289.84]  there's there's there's tonality right there's you have to understand the relationship between the
[5289.84 --> 5295.28]  people who are talking to each other you have to assume the best of people you know right but anyway
[5295.28 --> 5299.84]  i i can see that there's a lot of people that don't really seem to be capable of that so there's a
[5299.84 --> 5310.56]  scene in that video where as part of our um as part of our b-roll i'm sleeping in bed and alex comes
[5310.56 --> 5315.60]  up with a cup of water and throws it in my face suddenly and i wake up and i start like screaming at
[5315.60 --> 5323.84]  him and there's a comment that's like wow linus is normally so chill and it's really weird to see him so
[5323.84 --> 5335.28]  angry i'm looking at it going thank you thank you because that is that is so flattering apparently
[5335.28 --> 5345.04]  my acting skills are so oscar level that you cannot tell the difference between me obviously pretending
[5345.04 --> 5351.84]  to be angry i mean why would there have been a camera pointed at this if i was actually sleeping
[5351.84 --> 5358.16]  why would i be in the office why would there be a camera rolling why would alex come up and throw
[5358.16 --> 5364.00]  water in my face why would any of these things happen totally normal to me if your brain goes
[5364.00 --> 5369.36]  straight to this is an actual thing that actually happened and linus is actually angry you got to take
[5369.36 --> 5377.76]  a few steps back and go hold on a second how would how would the chain of events that brought us to
[5377.76 --> 5382.96]  this point ever have possibly occurred i was mostly just surprised you guys threw that much water onto
[5382.96 --> 5387.68]  a bed oh it wasn't it wasn't that much like and that was my main concern i didn't i didn't care how
[5387.68 --> 5393.36]  much water he threw at me i just wanted it to be little enough that a it wouldn't like cause something
[5393.36 --> 5399.92]  to grow in the bed or something like that and b if we had to do another take it wouldn't be obvious
[5399.92 --> 5404.08]  that the bed was already soaking wet right like if we dumped a bucket of water on it you better get it
[5404.08 --> 5408.88]  right on the first take and we've had problems with stuff like that in the past right so i i don't
[5408.88 --> 5414.96]  know i just that was that was the story i committed to tell during the the pre-show uh which is on
[5414.96 --> 5422.00]  twitch and floatplane uh a few youtube viewers are wondering what pre-show um and so i i said i would
[5422.00 --> 5427.04]  tell it and i was just i was just kind of like i was flabbergasted right and it just it reminded me of
[5427.04 --> 5432.80]  of so many times that i'll read comments that people are like really taking seriously wow this linus guy like
[5432.80 --> 5438.96]  you know what a what an egomaniac when you guys got to understand that i lean into that persona
[5438.96 --> 5445.92]  because i think it's funny like can we all just can we all just chill like you know you know yeah i i
[5445.92 --> 5451.44]  think i'm a reasonably intelligent human being but when i was talking about right in the pre-show i was
[5451.44 --> 5456.24]  saying something like yeah because you know my genius level ideas or something like that no i don't
[5456.24 --> 5461.44]  actually think i have a genius level intellect it's just it's just funny it's just it's funny to
[5461.44 --> 5467.60]  be verbally ironic to say one thing and to mean another and to have everyone be in on the joke
[5467.60 --> 5474.72]  because it should be quite it should be quite obvious that no one should actually be that much of
[5474.72 --> 5481.28]  a of a like hot air balloon right and yet we have we i guess i guess it's not funny anymore because
[5482.56 --> 5489.44]  there actually are people who unironically do seem to think and behave that way so maybe maybe i need to not make jokes anymore
[5489.44 --> 5495.60]  maybe jokes aren't funny anymore but i no i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that jokes are still
[5495.60 --> 5501.60]  funny and if there's gonna be a handful of people that don't get it then i guess uh it is what it is
[5501.60 --> 5510.88]  yeah um it is what it is yeah yeah mitchell i mitchell t says uh that's why we have so many problems
[5510.88 --> 5517.68]  in politics because people believe what politicians say yeah minus not realizing that this is hypocritical
[5518.48 --> 5527.04]  um so okay i've read a lot of youtube comments probably literally millions at this point because
[5527.04 --> 5531.60]  i've read thousands of comments on thousands of videos i i'm pretty sure let's say over a million
[5531.60 --> 5538.96]  definitely over a million there's a big difference between people that are uh that are in on the joke
[5538.96 --> 5544.64]  you can tell there's a big difference between people who are in on the joke and people who have not
[5545.60 --> 5550.96]  understood the joke because you'll often see the ones from people who have not understood the joke
[5550.96 --> 5561.20]  about things that aren't a joke like it was it was not the punch line you know it was just a thing
[5561.84 --> 5570.24]  that you would have no reason to glom onto and be like haha i am big brain next level ready for some r slash
[5570.24 --> 5576.56]  whoosh when people don't get how in on this i am he he there's a huge difference between that and people who
[5576.56 --> 5585.36]  just seem to have no idea what i was saying or doing um maybe they weren't paying attention whether
[5585.36 --> 5592.16]  it's language barrier whatever the case may be i'm not going to be a hundred percent in terms of being
[5592.16 --> 5599.28]  able to tell the difference nothing's perfect especially not people yeah but i've seen enough over
[5599.28 --> 5606.40]  the years that there are definitely some people who completely misunderstand and sometimes it's not
[5606.40 --> 5611.20]  even a comment on one of my videos right sometimes it's a comment on someone else's video where i
[5611.20 --> 5616.80]  came up as a topic of conversation and someone will make a remark that's like yeah i stopped watching
[5616.80 --> 5623.60]  after after x after it was clear that linus doesn't pay his staff well or something along those lines and
[5623.60 --> 5631.44]  it's like you know yeah it's it's it's funny to joke about stuff like that actually when that became a
[5631.44 --> 5636.24]  significant pr problem for me i was like luke you need to kind of stop joking about that because
[5636.24 --> 5641.04]  yes in the early days like in the very early days of the company and especially when you were at ncix
[5641.04 --> 5646.72]  which wasn't my fault i wasn't even signing your paychecks yes you were making extremely bad money
[5646.72 --> 5651.44]  but i really don't think that that's fair or true anymore and i think that i've taken steps to make
[5651.44 --> 5656.40]  it not a problem yeah so can we stop joking about this because some people are taking it really seriously
[5656.40 --> 5663.36]  and between us it was a it was just kind of like a meme but like yeah it did end up becoming too much of a
[5663.36 --> 5671.44]  thing and like stopped but yeah the the one that i think we've managed to get away with is colton
[5672.00 --> 5676.88]  the the colton firing jokes nobody seems to actually take that one seriously but i could
[5676.88 --> 5682.00]  be mistaken maybe i just haven't seen the comment about it from someone who actually is deeply
[5682.00 --> 5688.16]  concerned for colton's mental health with this looming threat of being fired forever like because
[5688.16 --> 5693.84]  i believe i was the original yes i used to fire you all the time um the only thing that was annoying
[5693.84 --> 5698.88]  when that was a thing yeah was when random audience members would like take it too far
[5698.88 --> 5704.88]  right and then it was just like okay just relax but like can we just be bros and joke with each other
[5705.44 --> 5711.36]  can i joke about firing him and can he joke about me not paying him and like it's actually fine let us
[5711.92 --> 5717.28]  do our thing uh jammer responded by the way that's the person who made the comment about something you're
[5717.28 --> 5721.76]  responding to their comment um he said while complaining about people reacting too much to
[5721.76 --> 5727.04]  his online content which is not what he's complaining about yeah no um so this is an example of like
[5728.40 --> 5734.56]  clearly this is not some r slash woosh stuff this is like you've just completely misunderstood what i
[5734.56 --> 5740.88]  was talking about at all and then the continuation of that uh but now he's overreacting to their online
[5740.88 --> 5749.20]  comments it's not about overreacting it's about like yeah it's about misunderstanding misinterpreting
[5749.20 --> 5756.80]  understanding yeah yeah there is in order to overreact to something you have to have like somewhat even
[5756.80 --> 5762.96]  remotely the correct reaction to it and then take it too far but if you just have completely missed the
[5762.96 --> 5770.72]  point it's not an overreaction it's just nothing it's just random it's just it's just putting words on the
[5770.72 --> 5774.96]  internet that had no connection to anything i had completely forgotten about this and i don't
[5774.96 --> 5780.64]  remember what video it's in but geomaster337 said lmao i remember that segment where luke got pissed at
[5780.64 --> 5788.16]  linus and quit at the langley house i that was such a huge ego boost i had people call me concerned about
[5788.16 --> 5798.64]  that that was the biggest acting ego boost i've like ever had that was amazing so i don't remember when
[5798.64 --> 5806.24]  like when or why but i yeah i want to go ahead and i want to just kind of deflate both your tires and
[5806.24 --> 5812.16]  mine a little bit oh i'm not a good actor because because when i was saying before too you know the ego
[5812.16 --> 5818.32]  boost it was for my acting skill i just want us to all take a step back and go this is youtube
[5818.32 --> 5821.76]  where youtuber apology videos are believed
[5826.08 --> 5832.96]  yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean even the worst youtuber apology videos typically manage a greater than 50
[5832.96 --> 5839.36]  like dislike ratio it's crazy which tells you that half of the people watching it oh no bought that i
[5839.36 --> 5847.92]  disagree you disagree i bet you a certain percentage of them don't care oh okay that's fair okay fine
[5847.92 --> 5855.68]  fine fine so my math is wrong but i think it is fair to say that there is a significant a significant
[5855.68 --> 5863.12]  amount of the audience that is actually so so i don't know is it ignorant is it disconnected is it
[5863.12 --> 5868.32]  is it is it optimistic maybe they just want to believe in the good in people maybe i'm just
[5868.32 --> 5872.96]  cynical and that's why it's so easy for me to look at this stuff and go yeah if you actually cared
[5872.96 --> 5880.24]  you would commit to some kind of um something some kind of uh you know self-inflicted punitive action
[5880.24 --> 5886.64]  or you would uh you you would do something you would commit to something moving forward a lot of
[5886.64 --> 5891.92]  time you'll have these commitments to something moving forward but committing to i won't do that again
[5891.92 --> 5901.04]  is you know i won't do that specific thing again is not reform that's just that's just oops i uh i got
[5901.04 --> 5907.60]  slapped on the wrist and i i didn't like that slap i yeah i want this to go away right um you know and to
[5907.60 --> 5917.04]  be clear i have made apology videos i have but when i've done it i've i've done it in a way that i think
[5918.72 --> 5925.68]  was sincere because it was sincere like i've done it in a way that i i think felt sincere because it was
[5925.68 --> 5932.56]  sincere the most recent example of me having to apologize for something was when without doing my
[5932.56 --> 5938.80]  homework i called out tim sweeney and epic games uh for some of their claims are regarding the
[5938.80 --> 5948.24]  playstation 5's storage architecture and my apology was sincere and it wasn't just to tim sweeney and
[5948.24 --> 5958.48]  epic games my apology was to you guys because i screwed up the other the other thing is that i didn't wait
[5958.48 --> 5965.44]  when i screwed up i came and i owned it even though it's something that i could have easily edited out
[5965.44 --> 5972.48]  the segment of the when show only i think that the most the most upvoted tweet about the mistake that
[5972.48 --> 5977.44]  i there wasn't a lot of track had literally like a dozen or so likes yeah like it wasn't very much
[5977.44 --> 5981.12]  like dozens of likes this was not something that had gained a ton of traction in the community
[5981.12 --> 5986.40]  and it was something that i could have easily just brushed under the rug so the reason i made a
[5986.40 --> 5992.24]  video about it was because i felt terrible i screwed up that is not the kind of mistake that i should be
[5992.24 --> 5999.68]  making and i want you guys to be able to trust me to at the very least i want you guys to be able to
[5999.68 --> 6006.08]  trust that if i make a mistake like that again i will own it again and so we can continue to have this
[6006.08 --> 6011.12]  relationship of mutual trust i'll trust you guys to keep watching you guys will trust me to keep making
[6011.12 --> 6020.88]  it worth your while right like we we rely on each other so that was why it mattered um or that was
[6020.88 --> 6027.36]  why that was why it was i felt it came across sincere was because i was i wrote it myself that was another
[6027.36 --> 6032.08]  thing there were a lot of people that assumed that i had a lackey write it for me but i had a writing
[6032.08 --> 6037.84]  credit on it because i wrote it it was my words there's a lot of apology videos that you watch you
[6037.84 --> 6042.96]  just go you don't talk like that you don't you don't know you've never communicated like that
[6042.96 --> 6048.72]  before in your life this is clearly something somebody else prepared for you and i don't buy it
[6049.44 --> 6055.04]  there's also like this is the thing where like he's literally given an example of an effectively
[6055.04 --> 6059.20]  apology video that was legit there are apology videos where they don't talk like they normally
[6059.20 --> 6064.24]  talk but it's because they're breaking their persona and like yes that's not as really who they are
[6064.24 --> 6069.04]  and like there is there is some legitimate stuff out there there's just also a huge amount of not
[6069.04 --> 6072.80]  legitimate stuff i also want to address something because i think i have a funny comment for it yeah
[6072.80 --> 6080.00]  someone mentioned about how my um my self-esteem dropped because of the acting comments no uh that
[6080.00 --> 6084.88]  happened a really long time ago when i tried to be an actor when i was a kid because i am a son of my
[6084.88 --> 6089.68]  mother so therefore put into every single extracurricular thing you could possibly imagine so i tried to be
[6089.68 --> 6096.64]  an actor i got less gigs than our dog um at that point in time i knew that was not going to be a thing
[6096.64 --> 6108.72]  and that was okay and i moved on that was the right thing to do yeah yeah man i can sort of act being
[6108.72 --> 6114.40]  angry and there's no other yeah you can do angry there's like pretty much no other emotion i can do well
[6114.40 --> 6121.20]  the thing is like the thing about acting is that i found because just in appearing on camera so much
[6121.20 --> 6129.04]  i've had to get better at it the thing about it is that a lot of the time anyone can do it it's just
[6129.04 --> 6134.56]  when you're put on the spot it's hard to do yeah like if i'm sitting having a conversation with a
[6134.56 --> 6144.00]  friend and i want to act mad at them or i want to act sad about i mean i just you know like if i just
[6144.00 --> 6149.92]  want to just like goof around it's so much easier yeah whereas when you want to like be serious you
[6149.92 --> 6155.52]  know it like you can get 60 of the way there just by like acting like you're acting like that's one
[6155.52 --> 6162.40]  of the best bits of advice i ever got is pretend to be acting don't act just act like you're acting
[6162.40 --> 6168.16]  yeah because that helps you elevate it to the level that the camera needs in order to interpret what
[6168.16 --> 6173.76]  you're doing um and anyone can get 60 of the way there it's it's to get to that that next level that
[6173.76 --> 6178.72]  professionals you know they'll they'll have like these you know traumatic life experiences that
[6178.72 --> 6183.20]  they'll like call upon to like really get the miserable and stuff like that people that can
[6183.20 --> 6190.80]  cry on command yeah like that's that's next that's next level right yeah um but it's so it's so that
[6190.80 --> 6195.36]  like being able to do that like on command when the cameras are rolling when there's all this pressure
[6195.36 --> 6201.36]  and there's like 40 people around you watching you that's really hard yeah and i think that's where you
[6201.36 --> 6207.12]  see this difference between the acting skill of of a youtuber or an influencer and an actual
[6207.12 --> 6216.32]  professional what is what is so i was actually do you remember those those funk the jb crazy says it's
[6216.32 --> 6224.08]  because deep down you are angry luke do you know the um do you remember the funk commercials yes i do
[6224.08 --> 6228.80]  there's one of those in particular i think my hand gets like fused to the mouse or something you did a
[6228.80 --> 6232.96]  great job i was i was pretty proud of that what is there an example of something that you're
[6232.96 --> 6239.60]  particularly proud of that you've done on youtube that was more like acting based um
[6241.76 --> 6247.44]  hmm because there's a difference too there's there's presenting and like putting a little bit more
[6247.44 --> 6254.00]  enthusiasm behind it instead of just your normal amount and then there's like acting which is kind of
[6254.00 --> 6260.32]  a different thing i don't know not nothing that i can think of that's super intentional i don't think
[6260.32 --> 6266.24]  i've ever done anything really good i don't necessarily think i have either but like is there
[6266.24 --> 6271.60]  one thing that you thought you did better than possibly something else you know i don't know honestly
[6271.60 --> 6275.44]  i'd probably have to lean on the community like i can think of things that i did that were really
[6275.44 --> 6283.44]  funny like i think that time that we did the bit where i was reading off of like uh like a a hostage
[6283.44 --> 6288.24]  like i was held hostage with a gun to my head and i was like reading off a script we got me all made up
[6288.24 --> 6293.76]  like i'd been beat up and stuff um i remember this but i don't remember what it was for yeah it was for
[6293.76 --> 6304.08]  uh it was for an intel review because i basically like roasted them a little bit before that oh yeah and
[6304.08 --> 6309.84]  so i was like reading this statement we had a blue gun to my head and i was like reading this
[6309.84 --> 6314.56]  statement to be clear intel didn't put us up to that and if anything i'm sure they would have
[6314.56 --> 6320.16]  appreciated if we hadn't done that yeah yeah um they've been great to work with over the years can
[6320.16 --> 6326.72]  i just say that like man intel has taken a lot of crap from us some of it deserved some of it not and
[6326.72 --> 6335.68]  they they've uh they've continued to work with us in good faith they've continued to try to improve
[6335.68 --> 6339.68]  the products i can't say the same for every company we've ever worked with they make mistakes
[6339.68 --> 6346.40]  they do we make mistakes they make they've made a lot of mistakes but they they move past it i i i
[6346.40 --> 6351.60]  respect them they're professional is what i'll say about working with intel um but anyway like i thought
[6351.60 --> 6357.92]  that was i thought that was really funny um i was looking at something the other day oh yeah i i was
[6357.92 --> 6366.16]  looking at the office fundraising video the other day whoa i was looking at it because i was been a
[6366.16 --> 6373.84]  minute yeah i was working on my ddr5 script and i was like oh i wanna because you know in my mind i
[6373.84 --> 6381.28]  wanted to open up the ddr5 video with wow it's been um ddr4 has been with us for longer than you think
[6382.16 --> 6384.08]  like when do you think ddr4 came out
[6391.84 --> 6398.96]  wow yeah what the heck 2014 yeah i was thinking it was it was really early office wasn't it because
[6398.96 --> 6405.52]  i remember getting new dims for a project and it being like a problem 2014. and so i opened that video
[6405.52 --> 6411.04]  with um you ever wake up and so that's why i was looking at that wake up tech one because i wanted that
[6411.04 --> 6417.12]  shot of alex splashing on me so i was like you ever suddenly wake up and realize oh my god it's been
[6417.12 --> 6424.08]  seven years since that thing i thought was yesterday yeah um and so i i'm using the splash and then i'm
[6424.08 --> 6432.40]  using footage from the uh the office fundraising video because we're all like babyface there's like
[6432.40 --> 6437.60]  seven of us working here yeah and it's to kind of put in perspective like for those of you who've been
[6437.60 --> 6444.48]  watching us this long ddr5 has been with us since linus media group was working out of a house
[6444.48 --> 6450.96]  yeah like what so anyway that that was that was the uh that was the point of that i think that i did a
[6450.96 --> 6455.20]  great job in that video i think it was really funny but like i don't think i've ever done anything
[6455.76 --> 6460.88]  where i feel like oh yeah i really like i acted the hell out of that i i really just don't think it's
[6460.88 --> 6468.72]  ever happened yeah i'm trying to find the funk mouse commercial so that i can show the stream
[6468.72 --> 6473.92]  uh it's on float plane i don't know if it's anywhere else i'm legit i legitimately don't know if it's
[6473.92 --> 6481.52]  anywhere else but it is on float plane got it that makes sense that it wouldn't be live anymore you know
[6481.52 --> 6487.68]  youtube just is full of such weird stuff what is this what is this thumbnail how does this have nine
[6487.68 --> 6494.24]  million views like i just can't i don't know i just can't you know uh if you can find it that would
[6494.24 --> 6500.48]  be that would be great in the meantime why don't i do some super chats sure oh hold on hold on hold on
[6500.48 --> 6504.72]  i might actually have another idea for where to find it nope nope that's not that's not gonna work
[6504.72 --> 6511.60]  all right let's do some let's do some super chats here while luke works on that oh my goodness
[6511.60 --> 6515.36]  there's so many you guys are not supposed to send this many super chats i need you guys to like i'm
[6515.36 --> 6522.24]  okay how do i do this because i feel like a lot of people will say yeah don't send super chats because
[6522.24 --> 6528.80]  they know it's going to prompt a flood of super chats this is not that i cannot read them all i
[6528.80 --> 6538.72]  actually do not want that many okay thank you um luck dragon build the far-right oligarchal fascist pc
[6538.72 --> 6545.12]  of pure capitalist greed to offset the extremely unfunny socialist pc that y'all equated to communism
[6545.36 --> 6552.08]  okay so this is a perfect example of a comment where um you're not the one whooshing everyone
[6552.08 --> 6560.96]  you're the one who got whooshed yeah the the the fact that we equated socialism and communism in that
[6560.96 --> 6573.12]  video is political commentary we the commentary is that so many people criticize both of these systems
[6573.12 --> 6580.64]  without understanding what either of them is that's the joke that was the whole joke that's why we're
[6580.64 --> 6593.52]  like her her left herbert burp burp sickle and hammer like oh i know i know please i know
[6593.52 --> 6603.68]  and it was funny you just didn't get the joke because you were the joke oh well what oh what
[6605.44 --> 6608.16]  i'm sorry i just
[6611.04 --> 6617.28]  boom roasted that's like and and to be clear lots of people don't get the joke because there's this
[6617.28 --> 6625.52]  hyper polarized environment that we're all in right now where everything is immediately is immediately
[6625.52 --> 6631.52]  awful and the worst thing ever because it's it's the opposite of me and everything i and all my friends
[6631.52 --> 6638.08]  and family believe in like no no there's room for nuance there's room for shades of gray come on
[6638.08 --> 6645.76]  okay i got it by the way good uh why don't i just get through these and then we'll and then we'll show
[6645.76 --> 6651.68]  your excellent acting uh javier pan says it's super expensive and the notch is ugly i mean it's no more
[6651.68 --> 6657.84]  expensive than any other like macbook pro come on sir myself sent this literally like two hours ago
[6657.84 --> 6664.88]  before i complained about it i know you don't like super chats linus stop uh isaac asks what inventory
[6664.88 --> 6668.00]  software do you use to keep track of all your tech i'm looking for some options we're actually
[6668.00 --> 6674.56]  just switching we were using asset manager which is okay and now we're using what is it called again
[6674.56 --> 6679.36]  it's it's built on an open source system called snipe it we've done a very significant amount of
[6679.36 --> 6684.56]  custom work um but yeah it's built on snipe it's nice it's very cool i'm not trying to discount them
[6684.56 --> 6689.60]  i'm just we've done a lot of custom work to make it better for linus media group specifically we're
[6689.60 --> 6696.08]  still waiting on you guys to switch to it but so ravenrock again you don't get it ravenrock says it's
[6696.08 --> 6701.92]  just a joke tell that to people like me where socialists killed thousands of people lol no
[6701.92 --> 6707.76]  socialism is not is not a system of beliefs that has anything to do with killing people
[6708.96 --> 6716.80]  don't buy into the branding what you're doing is you're buying into the branding just because something
[6716.80 --> 6726.88]  is branded socialist say for example the bc liberal party okay the bc liberal party is has a actually no
[6726.88 --> 6734.24]  political affiliation with our federal liberal party which is extremely confusing and b is actually the
[6734.24 --> 6740.80]  more right-leaning party in british columbia compared to our other major party that actually wins any
[6740.80 --> 6751.04]  elections the ndp so you could say wow if only the liberals didn't do all these fiscally conservative
[6751.04 --> 6758.72]  things well screw you liberals but you've actually completely misunderstand misunderstood what's going on
[6758.72 --> 6767.20]  here because our liberals are not actually left-leaning and even even the whole idea of this political
[6767.20 --> 6773.60]  spectrum this right and left all it does is oversimplify things to the point where we're just trying to apply
[6773.60 --> 6781.68]  these labels that are not fitting you can't just label things you have to look at individual policies
[6781.68 --> 6789.20]  a policy of killing people is not a socialist policy that's a policy of being an asshole like that it's it
[6791.28 --> 6794.96]  people are telling me to try to stop you but i think this is an important thing for a line to get off his chest
[6794.96 --> 6800.96]  uh someone from sweden saying our socialism is very different than stalinism or whatever um like
[6800.96 --> 6810.72]  yeah it's interesting yeah i mean yeah in in in canada socialist policies like like universal health
[6810.72 --> 6816.88]  care literally do the opposite of killing people like they literally do the opposite of killing people
[6817.60 --> 6824.24]  so you've got to try to look past the branding thank you all right
[6824.96 --> 6834.56]  all right that's stuff done that's my that is my last on the subject whoo um the extra port hater
[6834.56 --> 6840.16]  has to be riley no not so much let's just let's just let's blitz through a bunch of these andrew says
[6840.16 --> 6844.08]  the webcam isn't important to me at all i think i don't think the quality of your webcam is important
[6844.08 --> 6851.76]  in any context sorry andrew other people talk to people so okay i'm okay okay i gotta stop okay i gotta stop
[6851.76 --> 6859.84]  okay you're all right andrew antagonizing all of our all of our most committed viewers
[6862.88 --> 6870.80]  boom roasted want to get roasted by linus super chat no no if you say that they're going to send super
[6870.80 --> 6878.96]  chats i'm not roasting anyone else okay yeah sorry jake eagle the eagle says yo linus new indie game dev here
[6878.96 --> 6883.68]  been watching you guys since middle school completed my first build a few months ago finished my second
[6883.68 --> 6887.92]  a couple days ago going to be switching cases on my current sunday hey love that you're enjoying the
[6887.92 --> 6895.12]  hobby we enjoy the hobby too it's freaking awesome and and we love it uh thanks axel wants to know when
[6895.12 --> 6902.24]  we'll restock the black long sleeve um i think you mean short circuit shirt unless you mean wansho hoodie
[6902.80 --> 6907.84]  which is the one that i've been wearing so the wansho hoodie is on a ship it's a matter of time it's coming
[6907.84 --> 6914.72]  uh as for the short circuit long sleeve we've been trying really hard to get our own garments going
[6914.72 --> 6919.52]  and it has taken some time but we are getting there we are getting there
[6921.76 --> 6927.36]  all right uh dat says hi i'm not expecting this to get answered if it does cool i'm thinking about
[6927.36 --> 6933.76]  upgrading from an lga 2011 zion 8 core to a threadripper 1920x running a windows vm under ubuntu and
[6933.76 --> 6939.52]  i was wondering if it was a bad idea only you can tell me if you need more course if you need 16
[6939.52 --> 6947.52]  course hey go for it buddy uh 1920x i believe that's the 16 core or is that the 24 core there's
[6947.52 --> 6952.96]  also something i've been kind of recommending to people lately um which might sound lame but it's not
[6952.96 --> 6961.20]  check out riley's video on not running ultra specs in games wait is that no the 1920x is a 12 core that's
[6961.20 --> 6967.84]  right the 1950x is the 16 core i got my i got my wires crossed i forgot that uh gen one maxed out
[6967.84 --> 6976.40]  at 16 course um man yeah it's gonna be it's not gonna be as big of an upgrade in certain things as
[6976.40 --> 6979.68]  you might think but if you really need a lot of course because you're big into virtualization then
[6979.68 --> 6985.60]  it could be a big improvement i do think the 19 i do think the first gen threadrippers are a pretty
[6985.60 --> 6990.72]  good deal especially because you can still get boards new at least you could recently i talked about
[6990.72 --> 6997.12]  this when i did the uh the badminton streaming setup uh video for the for my son's badminton school
[6997.92 --> 7003.28]  i went first gen threadripper because boards were still available new which means that used boards
[7003.28 --> 7009.04]  were cheap instead of the opposite of that which happens when you've got the boards having been
[7009.04 --> 7013.60]  discontinued and the boards start to die the cpus are still working and the board premium starts to
[7013.60 --> 7018.08]  go up and up and up and up so i i found that it was a very good value for me but your mileage may vary
[7018.08 --> 7023.20]  uh alex says hey random question has valve addressed games that require a separate launcher
[7023.20 --> 7027.92]  regarding the steam deck um i think that's something that they are working with and yes
[7027.92 --> 7031.44]  they have talked about are they're working with other game developers and launcher developers and
[7031.44 --> 7035.36]  that is something they're working on it is a big issue with their 100 of the steam library is going to
[7035.36 --> 7040.72]  be compatible thing so uh matthew says hey linus please bring the beanies back you literally are teasing
[7040.72 --> 7045.52]  us with one as you speak they're back they're back yeah the qc issues were to do with the stitching on the
[7045.52 --> 7049.92]  inside we fixed all of the original inventory so it's back in stock and we've got a bunch of new
[7049.92 --> 7054.48]  colors now as well robotech about to switch to linux i only play vr
[7057.84 --> 7064.48]  might want to look into that yeah quick do a little bit of research yeah yep um pascal says hey as
[7064.48 --> 7071.44]  someone who's invested in a big 8k tv will there be more 8k videos uh yes but i can tell you right now
[7071.44 --> 7076.56]  that given that we're switching over to 4k cameras for our production it's going to be fake 0 8k we'll
[7076.56 --> 7080.24]  just upscale it and it'll look fine because you're not going to be able to tell the difference got
[7080.24 --> 7085.52]  them uh james says now not because like it's you just because it's really really hard to tell the
[7085.52 --> 7090.72]  difference uh james says as someone who daily drives manjaro i'd honestly recommend distro hopping
[7090.72 --> 7095.28]  it's not beginner friendly and kde isn't particularly beginner friendly as a desktop environment i mean what do
[7095.28 --> 7099.92]  you mean kde is not beginner friendly as a desktop environment i haven't heard many complaints in that
[7099.92 --> 7106.24]  regard yeah it's it's uh there's nothing that's been like oh i can't figure out how to change my
[7106.24 --> 7111.36]  mouse sensitivity there's nothing like that oh chris says i want any idea when the backpack will be
[7111.36 --> 7116.72]  available i'm not quoting availability on the backpack uh vishnu says i'm on a cross-country
[7116.72 --> 7120.72]  trip on my new motorcycle and the wancho archive is the only thing keeping me sane on the long roads
[7120.72 --> 7125.84]  you guys are great shout it to luke need more tech bros like him hey luke's a good tech bro nice 10 out
[7125.84 --> 7130.72]  of 10 tech bro heck yeah js2k in the us i wish we had the guts to make all intellectual property go
[7130.72 --> 7135.68]  into public domain after 20 years like we do for patents now 20 years is plenty of time to recoup and
[7135.68 --> 7143.52]  no code should uh should run that long that's actually not a terrible point i i don't know how it will ever
[7143.52 --> 7153.92]  happen but uh yeah all right let's see we're are we almost at the end here um oh man
[7159.04 --> 7164.16]  running into some painful stuff yeah my brain hurts want to watch a video no i'm gonna acknowledge
[7164.16 --> 7169.36]  one more of these comments oh is it a political one josh's bookish voyage says so if socialist policies
[7169.36 --> 7173.36]  literally do the opposite of killing people what does that say about conservative policies that actively
[7173.36 --> 7176.88]  fight against private health care okay for the second half of this i have no idea what you're
[7176.88 --> 7182.00]  talking about and maybe there's something specific you're referring to for the first part of it i didn't
[7182.00 --> 7189.52]  say socialist policies literally do the opposite of killing people i said some of them like universal
[7189.52 --> 7196.64]  health care specifically does the opposite of killing people because it's literally health care that
[7196.64 --> 7203.92]  literally keeps people alive instead of them being dead you can't stop branding things
[7205.92 --> 7213.28]  oh oh all right thanks guys let's uh let's watch luke's video all right i'm jumping over to your
[7213.28 --> 7219.44]  uh it's not my video oh it's hey you helped this is no i don't want to i can do that joke
[7219.44 --> 7227.20]  our video yeah very funny especially right now you've done a good job of making funny jokes
[7229.44 --> 7235.28]  we do good job okay here i don't know if there's audio uh it looks like it
[7235.28 --> 7248.64]  just bailed you did a great job thanks you did a great job he actually like hurt himself when he
[7248.64 --> 7252.32]  fell off that chair which is pretty bad i think so yeah we shouldn't have we shouldn't have pushed
[7252.32 --> 7257.28]  ourselves so hard for some of that from some of that earlier stuff um pushing yourself too hard is
[7257.28 --> 7262.64]  kind of fun hey aside from archived stuff like that that's floatplane exclusive uh there's some pretty
[7262.64 --> 7268.96]  good stuff on floatplane right now including that's right ladies and gentlemen the first episode of pc
[7269.52 --> 7278.56]  or no pc our totally non-infringing game show where people will either win a pc or not win a pc
[7278.56 --> 7284.96]  man that wide camera i asked them i asked them is it gonna include this like crap down here at the
[7284.96 --> 7292.40]  bottom they're like no no no it won't dog don't worry about a thing dog oh so mad it looks so ghetto but
[7292.64 --> 7298.48]  oh man the feedback on this is amazing so far genuinely yeah like a lot of the comments are
[7298.48 --> 7304.72]  super positive yeah it's uh it's it's a really good video uh so that's up in early access
[7305.36 --> 7310.08]  it's not exclusive not exclusive we've got the new server video up in early access so even though
[7310.08 --> 7314.96]  we're not committed to a week's early access we're still trying to we're still trying to upload things
[7314.96 --> 7320.72]  early not not least because the floatplane audience does a really good job of telling us when we say
[7320.72 --> 7330.00]  something stupid and they've got our backs so it's like hey thanks guys um uh what was uh what was the
[7330.00 --> 7334.24]  other thing i was gonna say right and we're still trying to build buffer so we shot eight videos this
[7334.24 --> 7340.72]  week out of a quota of six so we're we're doing we actually got some really good stuff shot this week
[7340.72 --> 7347.04]  we did our uh rog x ikea gaming you know there's an an ikea rog gaming collection now
[7347.04 --> 7354.64]  yeah so we did a full gaming setup with that um we did ed's intel extreme tech upgrade so you know
[7354.64 --> 7364.24]  how ed's sort of a weird duck yeah cowboy his house is a reflection of his weird duckness that's
[7364.24 --> 7370.64]  actually i'm so much more excited for this video it's because ed's style is really interesting he's
[7370.64 --> 7377.04]  something i love ed yeah i really do i uh ed ed is more than just an employee absolutely i mean i've
[7377.04 --> 7384.88]  been working with ed for 10 years now um i i love ed and he's a weird duck and he he embraces style in
[7384.88 --> 7390.40]  a way that i think a lot of other people don't and he embraces his true self yeah in a way that a lot of
[7390.40 --> 7397.60]  people don't yeah he's like yep this is me i'm a little kooky yep so like seeing someone's house that's
[7397.60 --> 7403.20]  like that is genuinely exciting i'm actually stoked for this yeah it's it is it is something it is
[7403.20 --> 7411.36]  something else to be clear i'm a weird duck i get it i get it um he's just he's a different kind of
[7411.36 --> 7415.76]  weird duck i think it's just creative types man i think it's just part of the industry that we work in
[7415.76 --> 7420.80]  like i think if you went to a different industry you might find a lot more people who are more on the
[7420.80 --> 7427.44]  rails whereas yeah creatives they just it takes a different kind of mind to think differently it really
[7427.44 --> 7433.04]  does and people that would like yolo into a startup yeah it takes a different it takes a different kind
[7433.04 --> 7440.72]  of person to go i am a few months from finishing my program instead of doing that i am gonna go all in
[7440.72 --> 7448.72]  on this weird thing because it doesn't sound that crazy today but you guys gotta understand this was
[7448.72 --> 7456.88]  nine years ago it's really really uh yeah not standard it was a different environment that ed just
[7456.88 --> 7463.68]  decided to you only live once into like i i love it i love him for it it's uh it's great i think
[7463.68 --> 7470.32]  that's pretty much it for the wan show today because the last thing i want to do is manage to get sort of
[7470.32 --> 7479.76]  you know debated into uh more more discussion yeah nice more more political uh more political chats
[7479.76 --> 7488.40]  i mean i just i don't think a lot of my views should be that contribute controversial you know
[7488.40 --> 7494.88]  just caring about people shouldn't be controversial and you can't put a label on that because there's
[7494.88 --> 7500.72]  lots of ways that under the umbrellas of any number of different systems you can care about people and
[7500.72 --> 7506.56]  there's a lot of ways that under any system by not caring about people you can have it all go to hell
[7507.36 --> 7514.32]  so if we all just you know and there's actually there's there there's unfortunate uh yeah yeah chat's
[7514.32 --> 7519.44]  telling me to stop you again there there there are there are conflicting forms of caring for people
[7519.44 --> 7524.16]  which makes things a little bit complicated of course but you kind of want that because that's going
[7524.16 --> 7529.68]  to drive things forward the problem is when though is when both sides are not arguing in good faith
[7529.68 --> 7534.00]  right yes yeah because there's one side wants the other side to lose just because they
[7535.20 --> 7540.64]  want the other side to lose yes yes yeah that's that's not good when both sides want the country to be
[7540.64 --> 7547.04]  better or the the situation be better or whatever um but don't agree on things that can actually be a
[7547.04 --> 7552.40]  very beneficial situation absolutely yeah because at least it means that you are you're gonna try
[7552.40 --> 7557.12]  something and then if you don't try that then or if it doesn't work then you can try other ideas yeah
[7557.12 --> 7562.96]  this is great okay wicked falsehood you're the last chat i'm gonna read today oh no
[7563.52 --> 7566.24]  chat is whiny governments who kill people are bad
