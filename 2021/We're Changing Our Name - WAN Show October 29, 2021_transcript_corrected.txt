[0.00 → 11.16] welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[11.16 → 20.86] lots of great topics naturally the big news this week is Facebook has decided with all the stuff
[20.86 → 24.96] that they've got going on right now all the controversy you know what the solution is
[24.96 → 31.50] change your name new name move to a new city new name honestly that's right that's right
[31.50 → 35.88] Facebook is now meta we're going to be talking about that naturally with all of our recent
[35.88 → 40.56] controversy uh we're going to be changing our name as well so we're going to get you guys to
[40.56 → 46.20] weigh in on that let us know what you want to see yeah um Linus Meteor Groupie Mick Linus
[46.20 → 48.78] Media Group face is one of the front-runners right now
[48.78 → 56.86] in other news Intel Soft launched their Alder Lake CPUs we're going to be talking about that
[56.86 → 62.78] I might uh talk a little bit about my attempt at getting my hands on an engineering sample so that
[62.78 → 69.16] I could publish data about it early my failed attempt so I can get into some of the
[69.16 → 74.50] technical issues that I ran in around ran into around that what else we got this week the N64
[74.50 → 85.00] collection on the Switch is um disappointing it's not really news though what else do we have
[85.00 → 93.46] in here a copyright office is lessening the legal risks of DRM on repairs' oh that's that's good that
[93.46 → 95.62] is good that's good I like it let's roll that intro guys
[95.62 → 112.70] artists formerly known as Linus that's that's pretty good that's pretty good
[112.70 → 122.16] and the show is brought to you all by Secret Lab Ridge Wallet and Pulse way
[122.16 → 128.92] all right why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day oh we didn't even mention what's
[128.92 → 134.10] going to be another one of our major topics this week uh we got to talk about Linux challenge we
[134.10 → 140.16] didn't touch on it at all last week oh so obviously we're not going to spoil everything for you guys
[140.16 → 148.50] but Luke and I were both shooting our parts of part three I haven't seen uh what Luke ended up
[148.50 → 154.86] doing but okay you know what we'll get into it later first we got to talk about Facebook being
[154.86 → 160.96] in turmoil with whistleblower leaks and a new name so they've topped headlines this week and actually
[160.96 → 168.42] yeah quite quite quite a bit of man they've been in the news a lot lately they have and yeah I'll get into
[168.42 → 176.76] it in a second, but that's hilarious is the last couple of weeks being in person has made
[176.76 → 182.22] it so much easier to not do that yeah to not do that, and it's like we're it's like we're back in our
[182.22 → 190.32] in our houses again um dealing with stream delays okay so the Facebook papers okay released by
[190.32 → 196.56] whistleblower Francis Haugen drilled the company's business practices in front of Congress
[196.56 → 202.38] for creating a structure of incentivization on growth while harvesting resources away from
[202.38 → 208.32] important safety programs revelations from the documents have intensified concerns about Facebook's
[208.32 → 214.62] influence particularly on children's and teens mental health I mean man my mind is blown right now
[214.62 → 220.00] Facebook is not good for the mental health of kids because my kids that's the first thing I did
[220.00 → 223.74] I got them Facebook got them on Facebook I got them on that Facebook get them on Twitter make sure
[223.74 → 227.40] they're on that Facebook I mean how else are they going to talk to their boomer relatives yeah
[227.40 → 233.34] yeah I mean that's what Facebook's good for right that's mostly what I use it for
[233.34 → 242.14] 100% of what I use it for yeah yeah that's the thing anyway revelations uh as Haugen was testifying
[242.14 → 250.98] Facebook's representatives tweeted and emailed talking points rebutting Haugen's testimony
[250.98 → 256.74] one of their main points Haugen didn't work on many of the issues including teenagers and child
[256.74 → 262.74] safety that were covered in the documents that she downloaded well then the fact that you
[262.74 → 269.38] didn't work on these documents means that you couldn't possibly be qualified in any way to speak about
[269.38 → 276.90] them you know yeah, so fine cool in other news Facebook has decided to rebrand their corporate entity
[276.90 → 286.66] to meta like as in metaverse you know what I noticed too you mentioned uh that the people use
[286.66 → 290.90] Facebook to keep in contact with their elderly relatives right yes you notice how it's an infinity
[290.90 → 299.30] logo that's just kind of droopy like a saggy infinity logo yeah yeah I mean I guess
[299.30 → 307.46] that's uh oh man what is there to really what is there to really say about this in my opinion it's
[307.46 → 314.82] how lame they focused on like they tried to meme if I don't know if you picked up on this but
[314.82 → 320.82] they 100% tried to meme it their their their twitter right now is horrible if you go to twitter.com
[320.82 → 326.66] slash meta because it's not Facebook anymore um if you scroll down a little bit they just like
[326.66 → 333.14] are tagging other random people wonder what ordering groceries in the metaverse will look like
[333.14 → 339.70] at HEB hmm hey Balenciaga what's the dress code in the metaverse they're being like please
[340.98 → 348.58] please interact with us, we need more people to see this please it's just horrible it's so bad they even
[348.58 → 353.86] like retweet not even retweeted they made their own tweet about the fact that he had barbecue sauce on
[353.86 → 362.02] his shelf which was like the most obvious planted BS ever like it's just stupid no that wasn't
[362.02 → 369.38] accidentally left there get over it like this is the worst meme generation ever I actually cringed
[369.38 → 375.06] so hard at this stupid barbecue sauce thing because a few people tweeted out about it be like oh I found
[375.06 → 380.50] if there was barbecue sauce on the shelf it's like no that was there on purpose guys it was horrible it's
[380.50 → 387.70] terrible don't fall for it okay, okay silence brand oh damn it I was going to do it I was going to be like no
[387.70 → 395.70] no I think I'm actually up on the boomer lingo for this yeah it's trash I it just oh my goodness this
[395.70 → 402.74] is terrible Zuckerberg okay about the change okay, so the new name reflects the company's push to build an
[402.74 → 410.42] avatar filled virtual world known as the metaverse as it battles its deepening public relations crisis
[410.42 → 416.98] Zuckerberg stated together we can finally put people at the centre of our technology wait what
[418.18 → 421.54] together we can finally put people at the centre of our technology
[423.06 → 431.14] what the hell was Facebook ever before other it's an it was a social it was social media advertisements were
[431.14 → 438.42] at the centre of that technology okay that's fair that's 100% fair okay, and together we can unlock a
[438.42 → 445.94] massively bigger creator economy yeah because people first means that an embodied identity stays with you
[445.94 → 452.42] across apps so that ads can target you wait even better that's advertising first that's still the same
[452.42 → 462.26] thing Luke darn it we came full circle we were so close we did it again now we're going to have to rebrand
[465.06 → 466.18] how about taco
[469.70 → 472.18] we're going to make food now we're done with this
[472.18 → 483.14] oh my god okay so they also announced a new VR headset dubbed project Cambria which I find oddly
[483.14 → 489.86] similar to Cambridge analytics a second I read Cambria I was like woof yeah I thought of a name that was a
[489.86 → 493.78] little further away from one of your current controversies yeah I mean that's not really a
[493.78 → 500.18] current controversy they've had they've had so many hot spicy sexy new controversies that I think that
[500.18 → 504.98] one barely even registers anymore at this point yeah that's the thing about the news cycle right is it just
[506.42 → 511.14] we're we're going boys we just okay what's new what's new what's the worst thing that happened today
[511.54 → 513.06] never mind yesterday yeah
[514.58 → 518.82] so but yeah new headset uh by the way oculus is gone
[519.94 → 525.78] not a thing anymore uh so while the new headset is dubbed project Cambria oculus headsets are no longer
[525.78 → 532.42] called oculus headsets they're meta no this is brilliant because now people like you can never be
[532.42 → 541.46] like um oculus has broken every promise they ever made after the Facebook acquisition because now that
[541.46 → 547.46] would be nonsense you'd be saying this company what are you talking about what company you broke every
[547.46 → 551.94] promise they made after the acquisition by this other company they've only existed for what company are you
[551.94 → 556.66] even talking about yeah that company is not a thing and that company you're claiming acquired them is
[556.66 → 562.18] also not a thing so I have no idea what you're talking about it's all just meta now okay come on
[563.30 → 569.70] oh so now what we're going to have to say is that the company formerly known as oculus broke every
[569.70 → 573.94] promise that was made after the acquisition by the company formerly known as Facebook
[573.94 → 584.90] okay nice oh man, so discussion question okay this is from Colin who put this topic in the doc for us
[584.90 → 591.70] thank you Colin the heat is turning up on the social media megacorp is more regulation an absolute
[591.70 → 595.14] fact at this point or will the status quo remain
[595.14 → 598.34] oh
[602.66 → 608.82] there's a lot of money behind if it's a huge amount of money behind it and money can often dictate
[608.82 → 616.34] what happens so I don't know I think the status quo is gonna kind of just keep marching on Francis
[616.34 → 621.54] Higgins says breaking up Facebook isn't the answer fixing the algorithms is but maybe a little column a
[621.54 → 628.98] column b the problem is that algorithms are inherently sort of a trade secret for these
[628.98 → 636.82] companies you know as uh as a creator on YouTube which is uh you know owned by alphabet ha ha see if
[636.82 → 641.30] we're gonna if we're gonna if we're all going to pretend that these companies are a different thing let's
[641.30 → 647.62] use all of their pretend names yeah so we've got we've got meta, and we've got alphabet okay so
[647.62 → 655.62] if we're gonna as a creator on YouTube i kind of see this from both sides on the one hand I understand
[655.62 → 662.82] that the opacity wow that's a word I don't say out loud a lot whatever the the the opaqueness
[663.46 → 670.18] the lack of the lack of opacity uh the opaqueness of these algorithms creates a lot of distrust
[670.82 → 677.46] among users among government regulators among competitors who are also beholden to these platforms
[678.18 → 683.94] it creates this incredible power imbalance even partners like me who are
[685.06 → 692.42] kind of going okay well i sure hope the algorithm treats me well today yeah kind of important and i
[692.42 → 697.86] can spend a lot of my time trying to understand it and I can and I can increase the odds of my business
[697.86 → 705.22] being successful by understanding it how it works how to make it work to my advantage um and that
[705.22 → 710.18] creates a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty though because i can never absolutely know
[710.18 → 716.66] how it works because and this is sort of the other side of this coin in order to build the most effective
[716.66 → 726.98] possible algorithm in the machine learning AI age even the developers can't necessarily know exactly how it
[726.98 → 734.26] works that is just the way that it is you the way that it works with machine learning is you basically
[734.26 → 740.50] say okay here's the desired outcome whether it's I want the highest possible watch time or whether it's
[740.50 → 747.38] because I want the highest possible engagement and unless you put an importance on other things it
[747.38 → 753.94] will cleave those things out of the way in order to get as much possible of the desired outcome exactly
[753.94 → 758.34] and sometimes that can end up breaking things so the developers will go in and they'll go they'll
[758.34 → 762.58] tune if they'll go oh okay we swung a little bit far this way let's let's kind of tune it back this
[762.58 → 768.42] way but the true but the bottom line is that even the developers of these algorithms don't 100 know
[769.06 → 775.62] exactly how they work that's just the nature of the beast and if we forced them to open up their
[775.62 → 782.50] algorithms and how they work we could create a situation where a significant investment has been
[782.50 → 788.98] made into this technology that is now effectively just put out there in the open and I could see a lot of
[788.98 → 794.90] open source advocates for example being very in support of that but the point I'm trying to make
[794.90 → 804.50] is that i i i I see it both ways um you know this these are these are non-trivial these are
[804.50 → 812.90] non-trivial tools to develop um and as a company I think you expect some kind of return on your investment
[812.90 → 820.58] right yeah so I don't I don't have the solution that's for certain yeah it sure isn't changing
[820.58 → 827.86] your name um I don't I don't think anyone's going to stop calling facebook yeah maybe you
[827.86 → 834.10] know analysts writing seeking alpha articles or whatever you know where they're advising
[834.10 → 838.58] people of you know a stock to invest in or whatever they're going to want to make sure they use the
[838.58 → 844.02] the correct legal name of the company or whatever but I don't think that your mom or your grandma
[844.02 → 850.10] or whatever is going to stop calling the company that owns facebook speaking of which we've
[850.10 → 854.58] mentioned a few times that the audience for Facebook is much older than the audience for a lot of
[854.58 → 860.58] other social media platforms I wonder how they're going to react to the icon on their phone looking
[860.58 → 865.78] different and being called something else randomly I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say they
[865.78 → 870.50] probably won't notice or care for the most part because it's just going to be notification based yeah
[870.50 → 876.50] I think it's just going to be like I mean i maybe I'm over maybe I'm or maybe I'm under thinking this
[876.50 → 880.74] but you know from my point of view you have enough muscle memory for where an app is installed on
[880.74 → 886.18] your phone or whatever else you just i there, and it's not like they're not going to do a really gradual
[886.18 → 891.30] shift in the branding like they've changed their they've changed their logo before they
[891.30 → 895.62] changed the font of the f or whatever and I'm pretty sure they've changed the logo
[895.62 → 900.26] design for things like Facebook Messenger in the past so i I don't foresee that being a problem
[900.26 → 905.70] i think it's just going to be that people will kind of go oh for some reason Facebook
[906.58 → 910.42] their logo is an m now oh apparently someone in the chat is saying Facebook isn't getting
[910.42 → 915.46] renamed no the app itself is still going to be Facebook okay but what I'm expecting over time is
[915.46 → 918.50] that they might want to have some of the parent company branding in there kind of like how when
[918.50 → 922.90] you open up WhatsApp it's like WhatsApp by Facebook so we're probably going to see WhatsApp by
[922.90 → 929.86] meta so at the very most we might see some kind of logo or branding redesign, but it's not going
[929.86 → 933.86] to be anything that's going to make it difficult for people to find the app on their phone I find
[933.86 → 942.02] it interesting because alphabet yeah did this whole launch announcing their new company
[942.02 → 949.14] their name and stuff and then after that it was kind of like uh whatever like they didn't really
[949.14 → 953.06] push it on any of their other products or anything right it's just like oh yeah the parent company's
[953.06 → 958.74] alphabet yeah sure whatever um this one doesn't seem to really be that way they're renaming oculus
[958.74 → 966.90] headsets they're they're pushing the brand name really hard so how much of this is like can I just go
[966.90 → 971.70] tinfoil hat for a little bit here on you yeah let's go can I go a little bit of tinfoil hat okay
[971.70 → 982.26] so how much of this is this sort of mega rich individual that absolutely has sort of zero
[982.26 → 990.90] connection to how most people are living their lives sort of deciding that what's probably best for us
[990.90 → 995.54] let's put barbecue sauce on a shelf since we're since we're never going to rise above the station that
[995.54 → 1005.78] we're in our life anyway that what we should probably aspire to is spending the vast majority
[1005.78 → 1014.58] of our time in sort of virtual reality interacting with people virtually because you know virtual
[1014.58 → 1022.18] tourism and virtual skydiving is all that's going to be left for us by the time this sort of mega
[1022.18 → 1030.34] ultrarich individual and his ilk have hoovered up all the wealth that exists in the world and we
[1030.34 → 1038.26] better get used to it, and you know this is sort of this move to start getting us acclimated he's
[1038.26 → 1046.10] like weird like I'm this yeah does it not feel like super villainy these weird like awkward tweets of him
[1046.10 → 1050.66] asking like how are you going to order groceries in the metaverse they're like they're like threats
[1050.66 → 1058.98] they're not questions you know you see what I'm saying maybe I'll go to the grocery store
[1059.70 → 1064.90] you'll do what we tell you're going to do I don't know it really run the metaverse it really
[1064.90 → 1070.50] it really feels kind of super villainy to me, I mean he's a he's a super villain so it makes sense
[1072.58 → 1076.58] all right well that's all I have to say about that why don't we why don't we chat about the
[1076.58 → 1083.22] alder lake soft launch here intel took the wraps off their 12th generation core lineup codename alder
[1083.22 → 1094.90] lake they are claiming a 19 increase in IPC over 11th gen built on the intel 7 formerly known as 10
[1094.90 → 1103.14] nanometre enhanced super fin process no AVX 512 turns out people didn't care uh in on the mainstream uh
[1103.14 → 1110.98] platforms, and it took up too much dye space, but we are getting PCI Express gen 5. that's right Luke
[1110.98 → 1120.74] gen 5 DDR 5 128 gigs max memory capacity uh dedicated b clock support I don't know what dedicated b clock
[1120.74 → 1126.50] support means but um maybe that's just a typo in my notes here one of the biggest things is new
[1126.50 → 1133.06] power definitions so I want to I want to be careful about applauding this because it's the kind of thing
[1133.06 → 1142.50] that should have been done ages ago um, but intel is finally disclosing multiple power limits for their
[1142.50 → 1151.14] CPUs so what was TDP uh pl1 is now processor base power okay so that's the power the CPU is able to
[1151.14 → 1159.46] access at any given moment and what was pl2 is now maximum turbo power or MTP defined as the maximum
[1159.46 → 1165.38] power the CPU can access during boost and in the past for especially the last generation intel was
[1165.38 → 1175.22] releasing these CPUs with 100 plus watt TDPS that were regularly sucking back 200 watts or more so I want
[1175.22 → 1181.94] to applaud the greater transparency, but you see how quiet the applause is because this should have
[1181.94 → 1186.58] never been a problem in the first place still technically audible thanks guys but i mean
[1186.58 → 1193.14] that much it's not just intel like overall whether we're talking about you know apple with their
[1193.14 → 1200.42] intentionally vague performance graphs or intel with the things intel does there seem to be this
[1200.42 → 1208.34] trend towards DE-technicalifying uh consumer facing information that you publish like it used to be
[1208.34 → 1218.10] not that long ago that intel would publish a complete oops a complete matrix of all the different uh core
[1218.10 → 1224.02] counts and all the different boost clocks that the CPU could reach and they just they just
[1224.02 → 1230.26] published it and so you didn't have to guess oh if I have like an an a two core a game that you know
[1230.26 → 1234.50] utilize this predominantly two course what kind of performance will I see in that what kind of
[1234.50 → 1238.98] clock speed will I see in that compared to if I have one that's going to manage to hit four or one
[1238.98 → 1243.86] that's limited to just one they used to just publish it, and then they just stopped and I remember
[1243.86 → 1248.82] complaining about it at the time and then I guess I just got sort of slow boiled over here because i
[1248.82 → 1254.58] sort of forgot about it and now that they're sort of giving me back an inch I want a model I want all
[1254.58 → 1263.30] the proper specs back tell me everything stop hiding intel's performance testing claims that the
[1263.30 → 1269.06] new CPUs are at worst equal to and at best up to 30 percent faster than AMD's dozen 5000 series however
[1269.94 → 1277.38] speaking of intel um putting publishing consumer facing data that is questionable intel's testing used
[1277.38 → 1284.42] Windows 11 pro and took place before the fixes for Windows 11 scheduler bugs that caused high level
[1284.42 → 1291.38] three cache latency on dozen so how it actually performs is still unknown although what we do
[1291.38 → 1296.74] know is that it consistently beats 11th gen by at least that much so it should be competitive based
[1296.74 → 1302.26] on what we know about how 12th gen compares to 11th gen and how 11th gen compares to dozen but obviously
[1302.26 → 1309.46] when we do our review we're going to be laser focused on 12th gen versus dozen 5000 because that's what you
[1309.46 → 1314.34] guys want to know now I don't know why Anthony put this in here but I'm going to share it with you
[1314.34 → 1321.70] guys here are some facts about alder lake is an artificial lake in Washington state created by
[1321.70 → 1329.94] the construction of the alder dam in 1944 alders are trees comprising the genus Aldus in the birch family
[1329.94 → 1339.38] bolus alder is a hardwood that is useful for furniture and other structural use the catkins can
[1339.38 → 1344.50] be edible a catkin is found mainly on male plants and is a cluster of petal-less flowers on a stem
[1344.50 → 1351.06] used for pollination alder wood is sometimes used for smoking fish coffee and other foods and alder bark
[1351.06 → 1356.02] contains an anti-inflammatory and has been used by indigenous peoples to treat poison oak and other
[1356.02 → 1361.38] rashes for many years nice electric guitars have been made from alder since the 1950s thanks
[1361.38 → 1368.50] to the tonal qualities the wood possesses ah yes our discussion question is will AMD's cash be enough
[1368.50 → 1376.82] or will AMD need to pull off some kind of different magic trick to stay ahead oh man I don't know AMD has
[1376.82 → 1381.62] made some pretty bold claims about the kinds of performance increases that we can expect from cash
[1381.62 → 1390.90] but really to me the main discussion point for all of this is are we back to intel and AMD leapfrogging
[1390.90 → 1397.70] each other on a yearly or every other yearly basis and is intel finally going to be making the same
[1397.70 → 1403.22] kinds of investments that AMD has been making over the last few years to really drive performance forward
[1404.34 → 1411.22] rather than just being content to sit back on their laurels are you excited yeah no this is perfect
[1411.22 → 1418.66] okay this is perfect I think this is like stage two of the like resurgence of the CPU wars
[1418.66 → 1423.38] because they were dead for a long time and then AMD came out of nowhere and stole the crown
[1423.38 → 1428.26] and then intel just kind of sat around, and now they're both fighting and that's good how would
[1428.26 → 1435.78] you respond to the people who inevitably are going to tweet at your upset about how much faster the new
[1435.78 → 1441.78] generation of CPUs is and how worthless their last generation CPU is when they turn around and try
[1441.78 → 1448.74] and sell it on the secondhand market they're lame I don't care they're lame what do you mean rude what
[1448.74 → 1454.50] are you rude things should get faster you can't just sit there and be salty about your thing
[1454.50 → 1460.26] not being as fast as the new thing you should want progress right there's a whole generation of pc
[1460.26 → 1466.58] enthusiasts that thought that when you buy a 3770k you get to keep it for 10 years basically
[1467.94 → 1473.62] it basically holds its value for the better part of a decade I know people now that are playing modern
[1473.62 → 1483.54] games now on 3770 and 4790 case yeah they're fine they are still fine and honestly this new one
[1483.54 → 1490.02] even though there's the big jump your previous one's going to be fine dude like it's just a thing
[1490.02 → 1494.58] you're going to be all right and don't stifle innovation controversial take better stuff
[1494.58 → 1503.46] controversial take with so much of our gaming performance limited by the GPU especially as 4k
[1503.46 → 1510.58] displays have become I mean 1440p got affordable first nowadays like 1440p is like you can find that
[1510.58 → 1516.34] on Craigslist for next to nothing you want a 1440 display it's a great resolution personal favourite
[1516.34 → 1520.98] resolution okay if I had to have a personal favourite resolution okay but 4k displays even are
[1520.98 → 1527.06] quite affordable now and given how much of our performance bottleneck is actually has been
[1527.06 → 1534.10] shifted to the GPU because we're trying to push so many pixels do we need faster CPUs for gaming right now
[1535.38 → 1541.86] might as well take them you have to take them dude okay I mean yeah obviously it's better than a kick in
[1541.86 → 1547.30] the teeth, but that's not what I asked do we even need them I think not really for most use cases
[1547.30 → 1551.86] I'm sure there's some game out there someone's going to be able to find a game that like is really CPU
[1551.86 → 1557.54] bound sure like an esports title that's kind of capped around 250 fps we've got really want to crank even
[1557.54 → 1562.50] higher we've got 360 hertz monitors out there now you want to like really keep your frame times as low
[1562.50 → 1567.06] as possible etc, so there's going to be use cases out there where like yes it's beneficial I think the
[1567.06 → 1573.62] average user is not going to see a huge benefit between like this gen and previous gen but I still
[1573.62 → 1579.30] wouldn't say that that's a reason to not care about the benefit we we got to crank this hardware
[1579.30 → 1589.14] because like I think the people making the games be less scared to pump more things into it that could
[1589.14 → 1592.26] hamper performance if the performance of the computers are super cranked
[1592.26 → 1600.74] I mean we all know that the performance of modern generation computers is not really the um
[1600.74 → 1605.70] it's constantly the issue yeah it's all about how fast the modern generation of consoles is and the
[1605.70 → 1610.74] better the tech gets on the desktop side the next time a new console comes out there's a higher chance
[1610.74 → 1617.22] that it's going to be better off that's true that's always want for more that's how consumerism works
[1617.22 → 1624.18] so speaking of which there's this really cool banner that comes up here every once in a while
[1624.18 → 1629.70] all right talk about your banner yes okay we made this cool new thing uh you've probably if you've
[1629.70 → 1635.06] watched the land show to the end before you've seen us do super chats um no more super chats yeah
[1635.06 → 1639.94] don't send super chats anymore for real though please don't send super chats I know it's been a meme
[1639.94 → 1645.70] for a while, but now it's like actually a thing because we have this thing that's going to show up at
[1645.70 → 1651.38] some point not right now don't worry about it um that is an opt-in thing that happens when we are
[1651.38 → 1656.18] live-streaming its it could happen during the Wang show it could happen during a Linus game stream
[1656.18 → 1660.34] it could happen during something else pc build or whatever if you don't want it on something you're
[1660.34 → 1667.70] going to have to let us know um hey yeah I'll just I know I'll just have it on all the sweet yeah um and
[1667.70 → 1673.62] and it is as an opt-in if you decide to when you're doing your contact info on the checkout you can
[1673.62 → 1679.46] have your purchase show up on the stream and uh along with that you can send hey there we go
[1679.46 → 1683.86] along with that you can send a message and at the end of the show we'll read the messages just like
[1683.86 → 1688.90] super chats yeah I don't know if I can promise that we'll read all of them just like super chats because
[1688.90 → 1694.50] there's already so many in the show even before we announce the new feature, but we will we
[1694.50 → 1701.14] will we will try we will try yeah um really the motivation behind this is to be clear not to make
[1701.14 → 1709.30] more money in fact our margins on LTT store purchases are actually lower percentage wise than
[1709.30 → 1719.54] our margins on super chats the idea is just that if you are going to spend money in hopes that I might
[1719.54 → 1726.26] read your message on stream you might as well at least get something for your trouble if I don't read it
[1726.26 → 1733.94] there you go, so this is just a way smarter way for you guys way more worth it to contribute to the
[1733.94 → 1740.66] show because instead of just giving google money for no reason that they frankly don't need you can
[1740.66 → 1748.82] give you know our t-shirt printer and our warehouse guys over in Richmond there you can give them
[1748.82 → 1753.78] something to do give them some money to make you know what I mean keep keeping the machine
[1753.78 → 1758.42] keep the machine rolling here rather than keeping the machine rolling at Google where I think they're
[1758.42 → 1767.94] they're rolling pretty good yeah exactly so uh pierce Greenberg says it's a bad idea no it's actually
[1767.94 → 1773.30] a genius idea, and it wouldn't surprise me if we have other creators reaching out to float plane being like
[1775.70 → 1782.02] I need this is the best thing ever very shortly yeah, and we're going to keep trying to make
[1782.02 → 1786.66] it better we've already had some feedback um about a few various things we're going to implement
[1786.66 → 1794.42] those um yeah yeah it's cool uh Mike misaki says if you had cad prices for your local peeps I would buy
[1794.42 → 1801.62] merch we do the Canadian price is the price on the website times the exchange rate to cad
[1803.14 → 1809.06] that's the Canadian price hey, hey well look the issue is that our costs are in us dollars so if our
[1809.06 → 1813.86] prices were in Canadian dollars we would just be coming in every morning and moving them around
[1813.86 → 1819.46] based on how the exchange rate floats because we need to keep our margins consistent so that's why
[1819.46 → 1824.98] the pricing is all in us dollars all right let's jump into our next topic which I think has to be
[1824.98 → 1836.26] Linux challenge okay nice yeah how was your week um my kids are mad at me wait why because I bought them
[1836.26 → 1843.86] I actually bought four copies of Minecraft Dungeons about two weeks before we started the Linux challenge
[1844.66 → 1852.02] i i bought four copies of Minecraft Dungeons and I have refused to play minecraft
[1852.02 → 1860.90] dungeons with them for now the last three weeks because and this is hilarious the minecraft launcher on
[1860.90 → 1866.82] it exists on Linux there's actually a first party version of the minecraft launcher that is Linux native
[1867.54 → 1873.70] freaking ready to rock okay you want to play some minecraft play some freaking minecraft play some
[1873.70 → 1882.26] minecraft on that Linux boys okay you want to play Minecraft Dungeons oh oh oh yeah can't help you with
[1882.26 → 1887.86] that better go we better you better head to Curtis you better head over to Curtis and you better find some
[1887.86 → 1894.82] super out of date guides that do not work at all and then when you're done with those super out of
[1894.82 → 1899.38] date guides that don't work at all you better find some really great comments that are all like hey
[1899.38 → 1905.62] yeah Minecraft Dungeons is on steam now so you can just you can just play it through steam with proton
[1905.62 → 1912.02] isn't that fantastic no it's not fantastic I already paid for it, I paid for it in the Microsoft freaking
[1912.02 → 1920.18] stupid launcher, and unfortunately you can't just port your key over, so there's no way to play it through
[1920.18 → 1924.98] steam I have to play it through the Microsoft launcher that won't let me install it and Curtis won't work
[1927.46 → 1932.34] so my kids are mad at me, they're like why is your computer still broken like look okay look this is
[1932.34 → 1941.22] complicated it's complicated look junior it's not broken it's just not working yeah yeah if that
[1941.22 → 1946.58] makes if that makes any sense so that's been that's been a source of frustration in my household over the
[1946.58 → 1953.54] last few weeks um I mean my kids were delighted when I did get minecraft working and i and i and I did get
[1953.54 → 1960.74] discord working, and they were able to I mean my daughter was playing on Linux and had no idea she's
[1960.74 → 1968.02] officially a card carrying Linux gamer now at you know however many years old she is and I think
[1968.02 → 1973.78] that's that's really cool so when i talk about my frustrations I also want to highlight
[1973.78 → 1980.34] how amazing and how cool it is that this is a thing at all because even five years ago Linux gaming was
[1980.34 → 1988.66] like if you want to basically compile the game yourself it's come very far that's one of the really
[1988.66 → 1993.38] big things that I've learned in this challenge is that gaming on Linux has come extremely far
[1993.38 → 1997.62] yes a little while I've had some I've had some wins and I've had some losses over the last little bit
[1998.18 → 2006.02] um there's been a few games that i I just dove into expecting probably not to work, and they did
[2006.74 → 2013.70] there's also been a single game that I dove into completely expecting to work, and it didn't um so I don't
[2013.70 → 2020.10] know i was blown away by how easy it was to get an o1800 going an o1800 was a lot of you play
[2020.10 → 2024.42] stuff has actually been all right which is fascinating you know what I want to be careful of
[2024.42 → 2035.46] though okay I just said something that I want to be I want to be I want to tweak a little bit I was blown
[2035.46 → 2042.58] away by how easy it is now that I have three weeks of daily driving this thing under my belt yeah because
[2042.58 → 2048.74] it is still everything that is going to be said okay, so the part one is already out on float plane
[2048.74 → 2055.38] part two is going to be coming out probably next week on float plane um part three is going to be
[2055.38 → 2059.70] probably a week after that and all the things that I've already recorded in those previous parts
[2059.70 → 2068.74] where I say look this is not easy it's all still true, but it's also true that once you orient yourself
[2068.74 → 2076.18] and once you have some idea of like what are the buttons you can push what are the levers you can pull
[2077.70 → 2087.38] the troubleshooting process is worse than windows but manageable yeah if you're is you're pretty techie
[2087.38 → 2092.74] yeah definitely worse than troubleshooting on Windows, but a big part of that is just documentation
[2092.74 → 2100.10] I think one of the biggest challenges for me in part three was how hard it was to find because
[2100.10 → 2105.70] you're asking for so many stars to align you're asking for someone else to have familiarity with
[2105.70 → 2111.94] the program that you want to use you're asking for them to be using the same distro and in some cases
[2111.94 → 2117.06] even the same desktop environment that can make a difference yeah and okay you're asking for them to
[2117.06 → 2123.22] want to help you, and finally you're asking for them to have had all of those other stars align
[2123.22 → 2128.90] recently that's the biggest one for me, I found a lot of guides that are from like two years ago
[2128.90 → 2133.46] and you try to implement it, and it's just like wow dependencies are all over the place things are
[2133.46 → 2138.90] missing i in a lot of in a lot of cases I've been able to piece those guides together I've been able to
[2138.90 → 2146.18] see the steps that they took yeah and while I can't put my foot in the exact like pattern that they did
[2146.18 → 2151.94] yeah I can go down that same path and kind of figure it out find the same things and hack
[2151.94 → 2160.18] something together um but yeah I don't know i I didn't expect the crew to work the crew oh really
[2160.18 → 2164.58] okay I specifically went to go play the crew yeah because I didn't think it was going to work and it
[2164.58 → 2170.90] worked, and it worked like effortlessly or absolutely effortlessly wow i had uh you play connect
[2170.90 → 2176.98] Ubisoft connect whatever stupid renames I had that working so I was just in the launcher and I was
[2176.98 → 2181.46] like uh it's just kind of scrolling through games and I got the crew for free like years ago for sure
[2181.46 → 2184.90] yeah so I think it was like an NVIDIA game or something like that like a giveaway game or
[2184.90 → 2188.74] something yeah so I was like oh sure whatever and I just installed it launched it immediately
[2188.74 → 2194.34] perfectly worked sound was working everything was working it was great um but then grid 2 didn't work
[2194.34 → 2198.66] grid 2 is a steam game, but it's its something I don't know if it's Denuvo or what I think it's games
[2198.66 → 2204.58] for windows live okay yikes yeah it's its some DRM thing you've sure I don't remember what it was I
[2204.58 → 2209.38] think grid 2 has problems like on Windows I wouldn't even be surprised don't quote me on that don't
[2209.38 → 2214.26] please don't quote me on that I googled it for like a second it came up that there it was a DRM
[2214.26 → 2219.70] style problem and I was just like you know what whatever I don't need to play it right now um what
[2219.70 → 2224.98] else has been going on I there 's's one thing that my girlfriend controlled me with super hard
[2224.98 → 2230.98] at will um which is I don't have a media centre pc my computer is really close to the TV so it's
[2230.98 → 2236.90] really not required I have a not even that long HDMI cable that just runs from my computer to the TV
[2236.90 → 2241.70] yeah and whenever we want to watch something or do whatever that requires my computer we just
[2241.70 → 2248.98] switch to that input everything's fine I have the tv set to disabled in my display manager yeah so
[2248.98 → 2254.26] that my mouse doesn't try to go over there sure when I'm not using it um even though it's disabled
[2255.22 → 2263.70] if she turns the TV on while I'm using the computer full lock up full hard lock up oh no for I'd
[2263.70 → 2269.94] say anywhere between one to like three and a half seconds and of course because this is just how
[2269.94 → 2278.18] everything works it'll always happen at the worst possible time can I just say that my experience with
[2278.18 → 2286.42] Linux desktop has not jived with a lot of what people have told me and with my own experience with
[2286.42 → 2294.58] Linux on server uh Linux on servers the whole you don't have to restart if it's crazy stable
[2295.78 → 2302.26] whatever it is that you're talking about that has not been my experience in no particular order I have
[2302.26 → 2309.14] experienced um the system refusing to reset correctly I have experienced the display refusing to go to
[2309.14 → 2315.78] sleep yep i I have experienced um failing to wake from sleep uh actually it's waking from sleep every
[2315.78 → 2320.66] time for me okay but so I've been I've been pretty good 50 50. I've been pretty good on that so far and
[2321.38 → 2327.78] uh what was one of the other really oh not being able to force close apps that one's yeah that one was
[2327.78 → 2333.30] very surprising to me that you had that problem i just I am just having and this was a really weird
[2333.30 → 2339.06] one unfortunately it was one of those things that is impossible for me to have documented because what
[2339.06 → 2346.18] happened was I rebooted the system and I went to sign in, and it said your credentials are wrong and this
[2346.18 → 2351.14] was quite early on and I was like there's no way my credentials are wrong this is a password that I have
[2351.14 → 2357.94] typed in a lot of times because it's its uh it's just a phrase that I've typed a lot of times there's
[2357.94 → 2364.42] just there's no way but I'll try again didn't get it try again didn't get it I was like did I do that
[2364.42 → 2370.98] thing again where i typo my password twice when I'm creating it in the same way I've done it before yeah
[2370.98 → 2377.46] it's terrible I had to reformat a Windows server install that i I set up got everything exactly
[2377.46 → 2382.74] the way I wanted and then rebooted and was promptly not able to get back into it anyway I was like did
[2382.74 → 2391.30] I did do I do that again so I was like I hunt and pecked it I was like no, no no, no no, no no and I went
[2391.30 → 2397.22] to it wouldn't let me sign in I was like okay I must have done that again so I rebooted it just to see
[2398.10 → 2405.30] typed in my password logged in I've never I've never seen and I swear to you so I couldn't record this
[2405.30 → 2412.42] because a involved reboots and b I'm not going to record myself using a password that I like use
[2412.42 → 2417.38] for my computer a bit of a weird one that's just really stupid I'm not going to do that yeah um and
[2417.38 → 2425.70] so i I can't prove it to you but I swear to you on my mother's grave it happened she's not dead and
[2425.70 → 2429.38] she probably won't have a grave she's more into cremation, but that's not the point is I swear
[2429.38 → 2435.22] to you, it happened and to be clear like it's not like windows doesn't have its own bad behaviour i
[2435.22 → 2440.26] had I had a problem with my NVIDIA drivers haha they got that in common I had a problem with my
[2440.26 → 2446.02] NVIDIA drivers for a long time when my display wouldn't go to sleep I finally solved it is ended
[2446.02 → 2451.46] up being like a bunch of googling I had to go in the command line I had to go search for what process
[2451.46 → 2455.86] prevented the machine from going to sleep last blah blah blah blah blah it was the whole thing anyway
[2455.86 → 2462.98] managed to figure that out um and even in part one of the Linux challenge I showed this bizarre
[2462.98 → 2468.26] thing that my computer was doing where it was like the up arrow was locked on so I would press
[2468.26 → 2472.90] the start menu, and it wouldn't even let me restart it is would just go yeah it's like whipping up like
[2474.90 → 2480.02] windows yeah it has all kinds of problems the windows search barely works windows has had issues
[2480.02 → 2490.42] with sleep and wake for forever but yeah yeah, but before you sanctimoniously declare that Linux is so
[2490.42 → 2499.78] so so so much better um maybe just kind of do a little reflection and maybe see if you're just
[2499.78 → 2509.70] more used to it because as a user of both now hey yeah they're both bad they both have flaws they both
[2509.70 → 2513.94] definitely have flaws there are things that could be absolutely way better something that didn't make
[2513.94 → 2518.74] it into the video that I shot today and this would have been the most appropriate spot for it
[2518.74 → 2524.90] maybe I'll put it in part five that's more of like a summary is the way that fonts and text size
[2524.90 → 2531.22] is all over the place in my desktop environment oh not mine yeah it's just it's its i I'm not the kind
[2531.22 → 2537.30] of person who's all like oh the lines on these this new iconography blah blah blah like I don't really
[2537.30 → 2541.30] care about that kind of stuff but having fonts just like markedly different from one window to the
[2541.30 → 2546.66] next is pretty distracting for me yeah that makes sense yeah it's pretty annoying I though have not
[2546.66 → 2553.30] had the same issues that you've had with smoothness the actual KDE desktop environment like
[2553.30 → 2558.98] interacting with things has been great save for dolphin can I just say if you're a dolphin developer
[2558.98 → 2568.58] you are not going to like no part three dolphins is a piece of garbage oh this is going to be yeah it's
[2568.58 → 2573.54] going to be fascinating yeah I switched over to I forget what it's called I think it's the Ubuntu
[2573.54 → 2579.06] default one it's called two different things it's called files, but then it's also called something
[2579.06 → 2584.82] else it has like uh it has like another name file manager Linux I'll double-check I'll figure
[2584.82 → 2595.14] out what the name is maybe dolphin just isn't for you nautilus oh man yeah not nautilus has
[2595.14 → 2600.58] been has been at least better from a functionality standpoint, but there are all kinds of like little
[2600.58 → 2607.62] weird stupid things that are not cohesive even when it's working really well so for example I opened up a
[2607.62 → 2614.02] zipped file or a zipped folder rather excuse me is as I think it's a zip would be a file that
[2614.02 → 2619.70] contains the point is I opened up a zip all right and that opened up in whatever my default
[2620.66 → 2628.18] uh file decompression application was and in windows or in macOS uh you would be able to
[2628.18 → 2631.70] take one of those files if all you needed was one of them, and you'd be able to drag it over into your
[2631.70 → 2636.74] file manager so finder or Windows explorer whatever the case may be you'd be able to drag it over there
[2636.74 → 2644.66] and it would just extract that file, and it would copy it there well no not in KDE on Manjaro at
[2644.66 → 2649.94] least maybe other distributions handle this better but no instead you actually need to like a caveman
[2650.66 → 2656.02] click the extract and find the target and extract it to there that way you could have just done it
[2656.02 → 2665.94] through command line bro no if I want to look that's something that comes up a lot we've done a couple
[2665.94 → 2671.22] of streams uh Luke and I together have done a couple of streams just troubleshooting things we did one
[2671.22 → 2676.74] last night actually when we were trying to get this uh we were trying to test this feature and also
[2676.74 → 2687.38] try and get uh obs updated with a plug-in which was boy was that a journey, and also we got Anna 1800
[2687.38 → 2691.22] working, so those were our missions last night that ended up taking a total of about two and
[2691.22 → 2697.78] a half hour I think um it took a little bit so we've done some to be fair to be fair we
[2697.78 → 2701.54] we kind of sat there with you like AFK and ANO just talking to the stream for quite a while yeah that's
[2701.54 → 2706.58] true the actual diagnosing portion still I think was like an hour long
[2706.58 → 2710.10] no it was more okay yeah it was more yeah because we didn't even start streaming at the beginning of
[2710.10 → 2716.50] that right yeah we were at it for quite a while yeah yeah yeah, so the point is um we've done a
[2716.50 → 2721.46] couple of these streams sort of going through some of the challenges that we've faced live and there's
[2721.46 → 2727.70] a lot of comments that come up a lot and one of the really popular ones is just used the command line
[2728.50 → 2736.10] and I can get things done in a command line you know I'll create uh windows storage space stupid
[2736.10 → 2740.66] array thing in PowerShell, or you know I'll, I get as long as I have kind of some instructions to
[2740.66 → 2746.90] follow I'm not I'm not familiar with a lot of the syntax for Linux, but you got to remember I've been
[2746.90 → 2752.82] using computers since the Windows 3.1 days like if i have to go in and CD dot whatever
[2752.82 → 2756.74] i know the syntax for windows so I can find my way around a windows command line but I don't
[2756.74 → 2760.98] know the syntax for Linux so a lot of the time I'll end up fudging my way through it to a far greater
[2760.98 → 2764.74] extent, but it's not like I'm completely incapable of using if it's not like I don't understand the power
[2764.74 → 2771.06] of it is can be outstanding but what the people saying that have to understand is that you are
[2771.06 → 2779.86] completely off base the average user like the average user is not as soon as they see that
[2779.86 → 2785.38] they're going to be like what is this I thought this was a computer I thought this was I thought this was
[2785.38 → 2791.38] finished one of the benefits I think there are some drawbacks but one of the benefits of having a bunch
[2791.38 → 2796.58] of different distros and desktop environments and stuff means that there can be like
[2797.38 → 2804.34] no GUI no desktop environment command line only really like sick like infrastructure server setups
[2804.34 → 2809.62] that you have whatever stuff like that with like insane uptime and whatever else um there can
[2809.62 → 2817.38] also be GUI experiences that are much more advanced for very advanced users that maybe work in the infrastructure space
[2817.38 → 2821.46] and then when they want to come home they want to be using the same type of operating system it's very
[2821.46 → 2826.66] cohesive for them flying through the command line is second nature yeah it's its basically like walking
[2826.66 → 2831.86] there's all that kind of stuff but if we're trying to accomplish this goal that has been touted for
[2831.86 → 2836.34] quite a while now of like it's its the year of desktop Linux everybody's going to be using Linux it's gonna
[2836.34 → 2841.38] it's we're going to have massive penetration on the market blah blah blah blah you're not going to get the whole world
[2841.38 → 2849.14] this command line it's just not going to happen no and there are certain tasks like copying a file from
[2849.14 → 2856.90] one folder to another that like maybe you're Mr fast fingers, and you can get that done real quick in
[2856.90 → 2862.66] command line, but it's also really, really quick especially if you know certain shortcuts and
[2862.66 → 2869.78] like middle mouse clicks and stuff like that drag and drop yeah yeah it's objectively faster I will 1v1 you
[2869.78 → 2883.38] I will 1v1 you copying some files from one folder to another rust okay like i just I get if it's great
[2883.38 → 2887.54] for lots of things but some of the things that it's great for it doesn't need to be great for one of my
[2887.54 → 2896.66] issues with dolphin is that it doesn't allow you to um copy files into a folder that requires administrative
[2896.66 → 2905.46] privileges and not just you have to open uh open dolphin as administrator, or you have to go into
[2905.46 → 2914.34] that folder's permissions and edit them actually it does not allow it and one of the responses on the
[2914.34 → 2917.78] I believe it was on the Manjaro forum you know I don't want to I don't want to say the wrong thing
[2917.78 → 2922.74] so I'm just not going to say where it was on some forum but one of the responses from the community
[2922.74 → 2931.14] was well you shouldn't want to do that and I was like but I do because I need to copy actually it
[2931.14 → 2937.06] came up a couple of times already in the first just few weeks of daily driving Linux once when I wanted
[2937.06 → 2942.50] to install a specific version of java so that I could get the game client for forged alliance forever
[2942.50 → 2951.54] working and once when I wanted to copy that obs plugin into the obs plugins folder so it's come up I do
[2951.54 → 2956.74] want to do that now I need a way to do that, and the answer was well you shouldn't want to do that
[2956.74 → 2960.26] yeah use the command line if you're a power user enough you should be able to use the command line
[2960.26 → 2964.18] no if I'm a power user enough to copy a plugin into a folder that doesn't mean I need to use the
[2964.18 → 2968.26] command line I should just be power user enough to go and tick a box get administrator privileges
[2968.26 → 2973.62] and copy the thing on the other hand I really like how mint does it i just right-click in the
[2973.62 → 2979.30] folder that I need better permissions on yeah that I need temporarily better permissions on I just open his
[2979.30 → 2983.54] root and then there's this like red banner at the top that is like you have this folder currently open
[2983.54 → 2988.66] his root and I can do that in nautilus yeah yeah that's sweet i actually really like that one of
[2988.66 → 2995.22] the worst gatekeeper things that we ran into during one of our community streams was someone critiquing us
[2995.22 → 3003.30] for trying to get forged alliance working yeah like well who even plays that game anyway yeah we do
[3003.30 → 3011.70] we do that's why would they choose that random game because we play it we don't choose
[3011.70 → 3019.94] games based on what runs on the platform yeah that is the definition of ass backwards you choose games
[3019.94 → 3026.98] based on games you want to play, and then you go with the platform that supports those games that is how
[3026.98 → 3033.86] if you need evidence because you don't believe me that that is how the world works look no further than
[3033.86 → 3042.18] Nintendo does Nintendo make a single piece of hardware that could stand alone as a piece of hardware no
[3043.62 → 3050.66] okay then it's almost like people choose platforms based on content switch is kind of interesting its
[3050.66 → 3059.06] kind of interesting yeah, but it also has like at this point what a six seven-year-old like mediocre
[3059.06 → 3069.54] arm-based processor in it like it's for the price I think that if also yeah also I want to add that
[3069.54 → 3074.42] there is a guide for that game that we play there is a guide that says like this is how you get it
[3074.42 → 3080.58] working on the next yeah so like when we dove into it, we there are some amount of expectations
[3080.58 → 3085.86] that we would be able to get there you know and to be fair I got really close I was able to get the
[3085.86 → 3092.34] launcher open and there's one bug remaining that there are some kind of antiquated but like I was
[3092.34 → 3097.46] talking about before I can probably figure it out steps to troubleshoot I think I might actually be
[3097.46 → 3103.62] able to get it working I think it is possible, but it is a journey because that whole guide which is
[3103.62 → 3110.50] pretty long none of it works you have to change everything, but again it's like it's its a
[3110.50 → 3113.70] bit of an interesting experience, but it's not that interesting experience when you're getting
[3113.70 → 3120.18] berated by the community um but yeah it was uh it's cool I want to get it I want to get it
[3120.18 → 3126.66] working so my bottom line on this my take, and you can hate me for it is that the Linux community
[3126.66 → 3134.58] needs to stop relying on the command line as a crutch for creating user experiences that are actually
[3134.58 → 3141.46] usable yeah they can't just say well uh if the GUI doesn't need to do this because it can just be
[3141.46 → 3147.70] done in the command line because until that attitude changes I'm never going to be able to get my
[3147.70 → 3153.86] brother-in-law using Linux again though until that attitude changes in the noob friendly distros because
[3153.86 → 3158.58] I don't think like the Linux community needs to change as a whole I don't think we need to like
[3158.58 → 3165.94] notify the like elite user arch is going to be arch yeah and that's great fine yeah yeah but
[3165.94 → 3173.78] there are a lot of noob friendly distros that I think could learn a lot from and this is honestly and
[3173.78 → 3178.18] this was something I was also going to sort of discuss in part five maybe, but we'll see maybe I'll
[3178.18 → 3182.82] leave it out maybe I'll just talk to you guys about it now um one of the other one of the other
[3182.82 → 3190.02] sort of problems that I see is that this kind of UX research that a company like Microsoft or a
[3190.02 → 3194.90] company like apple spends significant amounts of time and significant amounts of money on
[3195.70 → 3201.22] whatever the end result they end up with might be uh they at least apparently do the research
[3201.94 → 3206.58] one of the things they spend so much time on is having people who are not familiar with the
[3206.58 → 3211.94] product come in and use it and provide feedback they watch them they watch them use it and I mean
[3211.94 → 3216.18] that's one of the things that windows is always sending telemetry data about is how people are
[3216.18 → 3220.26] interacting with the software do they actually use this button can they not find it things
[3220.26 → 3227.70] like that right and that's something that Linux I don't see outside a mega corporation like valve
[3227.70 → 3233.86] coming in and doing this that's something that I don't see a way for Linux as a community to fix
[3233.86 → 3240.98] because one of the things about the Linux community is it's the Linux community not the broader
[3241.62 → 3248.42] internet or computer using or just existing on this planet community and unless you have money like
[3248.42 → 3256.74] actual resources to throw at it how are you going to coordinate those kinds of of of like focus groups
[3256.74 → 3261.78] right like if I'm is I'm supposed to be what's the one that claims to be the most windows like it's not
[3261.78 → 3269.54] mint is it no uh mint is quite windows like um but I don't think so I think there's one that's like
[3269.54 → 3277.54] basically Zoran yeah Zoran's the one how often even if they've done it how often can Zoran really
[3277.54 → 3285.06] afford to get to round up a bunch of Windows users off Craigslist or whatever put them in a room in
[3285.06 → 3292.10] front of a Zoran OS desktop environment and watch them try to interact with it it's its
[3292.10 → 3299.86] not it's not reasonable for a project that is largely contributed to by people who are donating their
[3299.86 → 3311.22] their time yeah AJ that is the worst take ever I feel like you get a way better experience with Linux
[3311.22 → 3316.90] if you start using it without a GUI then everything makes way more sense we started out from the
[3316.90 → 3323.30] start we're like hey we're gamers you can't game without a GUI so okay text adventure games
[3323.30 → 3331.22] just they're okay text adventure games are real people too you can load games using a command
[3331.22 → 3340.18] line got them uh also I think AJ might be coming from an like infrastructure developer educational
[3340.18 → 3344.82] standpoint and if you are trying to learn Linux like honestly if there's someone in the audience that
[3344.82 → 3349.46] is like wanting to get into an careers something like that, and they need to learn the Linux distro and
[3349.46 → 3356.42] they want to jump into the flames jumping into the flames without a GUI yeah honestly that's probably
[3356.42 → 3361.70] a good idea because you're going to be forced to learn this stuff you're going to get very used to
[3361.70 → 3365.46] the syntax the usability of the command line these are going to be ways that you're going to have to
[3365.46 → 3369.14] interact with these servers, and you're going to have to interact with these different environments
[3369.14 → 3377.06] yeah so yeah you might as well jump right into it, i this is the problem with like with
[3377.06 → 3383.86] with addressing these types of things because they're such a wide user if you want Linux desktop
[3383.86 → 3389.54] you want average users you want gamers you want all that kind of stuff to be using Linux things have
[3389.54 → 3394.74] to be a little bit more smooth and clean with the GUI things need to be a little bit more straightforward
[3394.74 → 3398.74] stuff like that because people are going to want to come home sit at their computer which they
[3398.74 → 3402.66] haven't been at all day because maybe they don't work in it or whatever else or I don't know
[3402.66 → 3408.34] um and jump into a game to play with their friends yeah they don't want to sit there for an
[3408.34 → 3411.78] hour troubleshooting some random thing doing whatever else learning command line doing that
[3411.78 → 3415.94] kind of stuff they want to play the game I mean the social aspect has honestly been the biggest
[3415.94 → 3419.30] impact that I didn't foresee I knew that I was going to spend a bunch of time dicking around
[3419.30 → 3424.50] troubleshooting things I knew that I was going to spend less time gaming than I otherwise would have
[3424.50 → 3429.94] but what I didn't anticipate was that my kids are going to be mad at me yeah and what I think you probably
[3429.94 → 3436.34] didn't anticipate was how much of your gaming social life revolves around trying the latest open
[3436.34 → 3442.26] beta or playing that's been something and that's that's not a new thing I have always been super into
[3442.26 → 3449.30] playing and like people that knew me when I was 14 know this i I used to apply to be a beta tester for
[3449.30 → 3459.22] like every single MMO that ever came out I used like i yeah i um yeah it's actually really sucked um
[3459.22 → 3466.18] and if I was better at using Linux if I was more educated etc I might be able to this it might be an
[3466.18 → 3470.90] interesting experience to try to be one of those first people to kind of run into the wall or try
[3470.90 → 3476.66] to make these things work but at that point you're basically like you better be a character or something
[3476.66 → 3481.30] like that's a new hobby right there that's a whole new hobby and if I want that new hobby that's a very
[3481.30 → 3485.70] cool new hobby and someone else out there might want to do this and that's fantastic
[3485.70 → 3492.10] I don't do you want to play video games yeah yeah I want to play with my bros and there's like there's
[3492.10 → 3499.06] some stuff like I was able to play one day of the battlefield 2042 beta because that was the one day
[3499.06 → 3504.50] before I installed Linux, and luckily it was a terrible beta so I didn't really miss out on much
[3505.06 → 3510.34] yeah like there was still some FOMO there yeah I see my friends in discord I know they're playing yeah
[3510.34 → 3514.82] but I don't even care that it's a trashy game yeah it doesn't matter because sometimes a game being
[3514.82 → 3520.02] trash is part of just being part of the gaming community and people being like yeah that game's
[3520.02 → 3524.42] trash, and you're being like yeah I know I totally saw this like crazy bug where their eyeballs popped
[3524.42 → 3527.70] out of their head yeah you just like troll around with your friends like clip through the wall
[3528.26 → 3533.06] yeah the medium is almost unimportant right so like it's yeah it's definitely part of it you jump
[3533.06 → 3537.86] in discord while people are playing the game, and you get one of them to discord stream for you so you
[3537.86 → 3544.74] can see what's happening at least discord works that's sad yeah yeah you can watch someone else
[3544.74 → 3549.86] you're not totally isolated from your gamer friends if is you try to discord stream no one's going to
[3549.86 → 3554.66] hear the audio because that's not a feature that's on Linux hey god oh I didn't know that yeah oh really
[3554.66 → 3560.42] i I've never tried to this is part of my script for the next part so I don't want to necessarily go way
[3560.42 → 3564.26] too into it right but every piece of communication software that I've used, and you can probably guess
[3564.26 → 3572.90] what they are had some form of issue yeah screen sharing uh every single one of them yep okay some
[3572.90 → 3576.66] form of issue some of them are really like not a big deal and a lot of people aren't going to notice
[3576.66 → 3584.90] it right but some form of issue yeah that's really frustrating uh hey Blinken says seriously guys move on
[3585.94 → 3593.78] this has been this okay moving on the package manager in mint yes is sweet it's actually really sweet
[3593.78 → 3599.14] like i i I'm really starting to like it a lot I'm actually coming around to pa mac as well yeah
[3599.14 → 3607.06] Microsoft store is trash okay Microsoft store is better than panic but well okay I shouldn't say
[3608.02 → 3611.54] I shouldn't say better because one of the cool things about pa mac is that it can search
[3612.10 → 3619.62] other stores or repositories um including ones that are only sort of compatible with my distro
[3619.62 → 3623.30] so that's a double-edged sword right on the one hand it means that I can end up with applications
[3623.30 → 3628.74] that like only sort of work but on the other hand it means that the Manjaro developers don't have to go
[3629.30 → 3636.82] hand validate every single package and I was able to get like for example that obs plugin the package
[3636.82 → 3642.58] that I used was I forget if it was snap or if it was a flat pack it was not it was not from the
[3642.58 → 3648.58] Manjaro official repository so it was something that I actually had to use pa mac and override um or was it
[3648.58 → 3653.62] from AUR I don't remember it doesn't matter the point is from something else it did work I am now
[3653.62 → 3659.38] happily functional which is all that I really asked yeah someone in chat said I've spoken to discord
[3659.38 → 3664.90] devs about the solutions to the Linux screen sharing issues it's just that there's very little point
[3664.90 → 3671.54] fixing it because so few people on Linux um use discord compared to the amount of effort it would take
[3671.54 → 3678.50] to fix I mean honestly that's the biggest problem forever because like looking at okay Curtis right
[3679.06 → 3689.22] so oh yeah ANO 1800 okay so Luke and i both ended up managing to install this game via different methods
[3689.78 → 3695.30] which ended up resulting in us having different versions of the game installed which made it so that
[3695.30 → 3700.74] we couldn't play multiplayer, and you might say well how on earth could you possibly manage to do that
[3701.38 → 3711.62] well okay here's the thing you've got um three different ways to like to install it here okay you've
[3711.62 → 3722.02] got all these like comments get from steam blah blah blah blah blah but here's the thing okay only 356 users
[3722.02 → 3730.10] have added this game to their library through lutris and I think it's fair to say that
[3730.10 → 3739.94] the majority of Linux gamers are using Curtis I don't know that but i would wager that if
[3739.94 → 3745.94] you want to play anything other than steam games, and you don't probably go, and you don't want to box
[3745.94 → 3751.62] with like wine tricks or something like that which I still can't quite figure out I haven't in fairness i
[3751.62 → 3755.94] haven't painstakingly read through all the documentation or anything like that but i I'm
[3755.94 → 3763.14] still it is not intuitive at all I'll say that much um so we're talking there's there are hundreds of us
[3763.86 → 3769.94] literally there are hundreds of us yeah and even popular games like I was blown away what was
[3769.94 → 3778.34] that one that was like kind of major esport that uh had almost no users uh was rainbow six oh siege
[3778.34 → 3783.70] yeah see this is one of the problems though you mentioned we installed it in different ways
[3783.70 → 3788.34] yes I have had success I mentioned earlier in the show I installed the crew directly through you play
[3788.34 → 3793.94] yeah so that wouldn't show up on Curtis because the only install that would show up on Curtis for
[3793.94 → 3801.30] that would be the fact that I installed uh Ubisoft connect but then supposedly the Curtis way was the
[3801.30 → 3807.94] more correct way right like when we were streaming this last night for Anna yeah I got it working
[3809.30 → 3817.46] the so I used Curtis to install Ubisoft connect rather than using Curtis to install Anna and then
[3818.42 → 3826.58] however the launcher integration works for that uh, and so I think I had the more multiplayer compatible
[3826.58 → 3834.18] version but I think Luke had the more a performance version that's what we think was going on because my
[3834.18 → 3839.62] my game actually ran pretty smooth mine was definitely slower compared to running it on
[3839.62 → 3846.74] windows like 100 100 I had to turn and things way down and I got it I got it stable uh, but it was
[3846.74 → 3853.54] uh it was sucking back those resources we should probably talk about sponsors at some point can I do

[3993.22 → 3999.22] just typed a reply to him, you typed oh okay all right well all right let's move on then yeah n64 on switch
[4000.90 → 4006.02] kind of, so why is it disappointing no i I challenge your assertion that it's disappointing
[4006.02 → 4008.42] i it's Nintendo what were you expecting
[4012.50 → 4017.94] can't be disappointing boom roasted poor performance um yeah I have not subscribed to this
[4018.90 → 4023.46] wow so surprising crap I just refreshed this page, and they're all gone you have them right I've got
[4023.46 → 4027.30] them thank goodness why did you do that I didn't mean to i was just trying to scroll, and it refreshed
[4027.30 → 4036.42] oh so yeah go ahead okay um yeah I have not subscribed to this but I have heard through the
[4036.42 → 4042.58] power of the internet uh that it is a suboptimal experience I have heard that the performance is bad
[4042.58 → 4050.10] etc etc etc um it includes the following n64 games uh with more coming at a later date Di María 64
[4050.10 → 4058.02] Mario Kart 64 Mario tennis sin and punishment star fox 64 Super Mario 64 the Legend of Zelda ocarina
[4058.02 → 4066.66] of time win back covert operations uh was that a popular game and Joshi's story I love how that one's
[4066.66 → 4074.26] just like yeah um it's something maybe someone's a huge win back covert operations fan in the chat
[4074.26 → 4081.86] um the expansion pack comes with the Sega genesis classics collection uh as well which is 29.99
[4083.86 → 4089.30] I mean the issue isn't the games that it comes with the bigger issue is that the performance is
[4089.30 → 4095.70] apparently dog poo, and it's even missing some features like blur effects are changed or absent
[4095.70 → 4101.06] in the switch versions uh they've removed fog in some areas of ocarina which is like let's have a look
[4101.06 → 4112.34] run row wow that actually kind of that kind of kills the vibe here fog was kind of a pretty
[4112.34 → 4118.90] big deal on n64 actually like well it's how you got away with uh having such crappy draw distance right
[4118.90 → 4125.30] yeah but like a lot of times really talented game developers will use those limitations
[4125.30 → 4133.30] to inspire creativity in like boating through the fog is an is an experience right, right yeah so they
[4133.30 → 4137.06] take that limitation of draw distance, and they make it into part of the gaming experience which is very
[4137.06 → 4143.30] cool yeah, and you can see on the Wii virtual console it's fine it's only on the switch version that it
[4143.30 → 4149.78] looks it looks older like it looks yeah it looks terrible markedly worse yeah than on the original
[4149.78 → 4155.70] console and on the Wii virtual console like Wii virtual console is going to be the definitive
[4155.70 → 4161.70] edition of that one for sure I mean at least if we never get anything if we never get anything else
[4161.70 → 4167.06] yeah yeah but what a disappointment pretty disappointing especially when the price hike was like
[4167.86 → 4173.70] pretty high actually especially when the community has done so much more to preserve Nintendo's
[4173.70 → 4178.74] history than Nintendo is willing to do for themselves yeah, and they want to charge quite a bit for it
[4178.74 → 4185.14] regular switch online is 20 bucks annually switch online plus the expansion pack is 50 bucks annually
[4185.14 → 4189.78] can we just get on with it and make it so that we can just buy a license for the game and then
[4191.06 → 4197.30] guilt-free play it on whatever we want pretty sweet I mean honestly if there was any way to port my save
[4197.30 → 4202.26] game over I would much rather like if I was going to do another play through of breath of the wild or play
[4202.26 → 4206.34] the expansion or like because I was kind of thinking about it because breath of the wild 2 is coming
[4206.34 → 4213.14] I would much rather play through it on my computer at 60 frames per second like obviously because the
[4213.14 → 4219.94] switch is its anemic this conversation actually reminds me a lot of that that game that people
[4219.94 → 4224.10] didn't want us to try on Linux uh forge alliance forever I think they do it in a really cool way
[4224.66 → 4232.26] to play force alliance forever you have to like to prove that you own a copy of forge alliance which you
[4232.26 → 4239.38] you know what sure I'll go buy this copy of the game and then I will have the way better experience
[4239.38 → 4243.62] like the developers behind that are fantastic I'm constantly stunned by the stuff that those it's
[4243.62 → 4250.66] almost all community done it's almost no pain, and it's amazingly well done like they're very impressive
[4250.66 → 4256.82] uh like kind of just homebrew community dev team very, very cool um but i I would way rather go play that
[4256.82 → 4263.54] experience, and it's really cool that I can do that and I'm happy enough to buy the game and the forge
[4263.54 → 4267.22] alliance devs are happy enough to do that little verification process and make sure that I've bought
[4267.22 → 4272.66] the game yep and everything's all cool I'm not trying to pirate this game but I would rather play the
[4272.66 → 4278.90] community experience because it's just way better, and they're actually maintaining it unlike the original
[4278.90 → 4283.46] developers which I believe have been bought yeah gas power games got bought yeah so they don't care about
[4283.46 → 4287.78] it anymore which is fine, but the community does which is great and I would like to play the
[4287.78 → 4292.58] community version so yeah some type of purchase verification thing would be cool yeah
[4292.58 → 4297.62] Mr marker says Nintendo should just sell ROMs on a website to use on pc, but that would never happen
[4297.62 → 4304.34] yeah pretty much I mean never say never I mean it's its no secret that Microsoft has wanted to get
[4304.34 → 4311.78] Nintendo games on the Xbox um I mean they've done and i I would have said that's impossible but I also would
[4311.78 → 4317.46] have said that it's impossible for Microsoft to get Sony to bring their platform exclusives and yet
[4318.90 → 4328.66] here we are right yeah, so the impossible is now possible pigs are up black is down like i i i
[4328.66 → 4336.66] don't I don't know i I just don't know what world is any more yeah yeah um in other news YouTube is
[4336.66 → 4344.50] demonetizing low effort made for kids channels apparently so if your children's content is deemed
[4344.50 → 4351.30] low quality encourages negative behaviour attitudes or is heavily commercial you will be demonetized
[4351.94 → 4356.98] this sort of content was already on the way from way to being removed from YouTube kids, but now it's
[4356.98 → 4361.78] actually happening on regular YouTube so anyone not adhering to guidelines could be booted from the
[4361.78 → 4367.30] partnership program other protections for kids are on the way that include defaulting videos for
[4367.30 → 4376.66] users age 13 to 17 to private enabling take a break and bedtime reminders and uh no longer leveraging
[4376.66 → 4381.78] interests data from targeting kids and adults or for targeting kids and adults with ads
[4382.74 → 4386.42] so discussion question here is how much of the internet should be regulated and how much is the
[4386.42 → 4393.38] parents responsibility to keep their kids safe I don't think most parents are qualified to keep
[4393.38 → 4396.82] their kids safe and I run into this a lot, and it's not I'm not saying they're stupid people, or they're
[4396.82 → 4402.90] bad people I just run into a lot of parents that don't even know what discord is let alone how to
[4402.90 → 4410.18] monitor their kids conversations on it a rather extreme amount of oversight to track what your child
[4410.18 → 4417.70] is watching online it really does and like it's not exactly a secret these days like yeah when I was
[4417.70 → 4423.46] growing up like my dad was tech-savvy so I couldn't get away with anything but like most the parents of
[4423.46 → 4429.30] my friends had no idea how to check a history on a browser oh for sure 100 so like that didn't matter
[4429.30 → 4435.06] yep um, but there 's's more advanced stuff than that, and it's every YouTuber on the planet is
[4435.06 → 4440.10] talking about VPNs these days and like etc etc etc so like being able to stay on top of this
[4440.10 → 4447.70] stuff yeah it's tough that's very tough it's also YouTube's platform, and they can do whatever they
[4447.70 → 4451.22] want yeah well I don't think this is what they want to do I think they could make more money
[4451.22 → 4455.46] marketing heavily to kids and I think that the fact that they've waited so long to do this
[4455.46 → 4462.74] demonstrates that that is in fact what they would prefer to do fair yeah okay however um
[4462.74 → 4471.22] uh I mean I guess better late than never oh uh teamseize.org we've apparently dropped from number
[4471.22 → 4479.62] fifth to number eighth I actually don't know how to check that if you open it and then scroll
[4479.62 → 4487.38] down a little bit and click on most trash oh okay instead of most recent there we go so i so I'm gonna
[4487.38 → 4496.34] find out who's the most trash uh so where are we at oh there we go right there oh, oh of course you
[4496.34 → 4506.98] know what's the funniest part of this number um nice I did not specify that, and you know who handles the
[4506.98 → 4518.50] money here right yeah so somehow Yvonne managed to manage to work a 69 joke into our uh into our stupid
[4518.50 → 4524.02] donation for team sees so if you guys didn't see it today we just did a little video calling out
[4524.02 → 4530.18] team sees go check it out uh basically it's all about removing trash from the ocean so every dollar
[4530.18 → 4538.98] um Mr beast's partners have agreed to remove a pound of trash from the ocean the goal is to remove
[4538.98 → 4545.78] 30 million pounds by the first of January next year, so guys go check it out as far as I know this is
[4545.78 → 4556.74] the largest YouTuber collab um ever so yeah yeah get uh get get on get on that knock me off the
[4556.74 → 4564.42] front page here I'm into it do it yeah why not uh what else we got we need to talk about this week
[4565.70 → 4565.94] um
[4572.74 → 4580.02] copyright office yeah you're so enthused about this topic tell me more copyright office lessening the
[4580.02 → 4585.38] risks of DRM on repair it's just it's that it's lessening that's such a
[4586.74 → 4590.02] whiff tell me why just
[4593.62 → 4598.50] just go further be harder on this stuff I don't know like there 's's so much push right now
[4598.50 → 4604.50] we're seeing we're seeing multiple companies embrace the idea framework and others I'm sorry
[4604.50 → 4611.54] I just can't remember the names valve yes 100 yeah good call there's that phone yep, yep fair phone yep
[4611.54 → 4617.14] okay got it uh there 's's other stuff I think probably coming out where Microsoft is doing that
[4617.14 → 4622.26] internal investigation into whether right to repair is important spoiler it is wacky but at least they're
[4622.26 → 4627.70] trying yeah um it's we're seeing companies embrace the idea of right to repair which is fantastic people
[4627.70 → 4633.54] like lewis Grossman and others are really really really pushing yep this stuff Marquez did a video
[4633.54 → 4639.30] about it a couple of months ago you guys did it was very good by the way oh I said Marquez yeah and so
[4639.30 → 4644.26] did you oh oh oh i sorry yes we did I just I thought you misheard me I was adding on to it yeah yeah
[4644.26 → 4647.46] no I wasn't asking for a pat on the back this is perfect yours is perfect there 's's
[4647.46 → 4655.94] been lots of stuff out there just do it don't like sort of do it so basically the register recommended
[4655.94 → 4663.06] exemptions to unlocking wireless telecommunications devices expanding on the devices that one can jail
[4663.06 → 4668.26] break to allow it to interoperate with or to remove software applications and allow diagnosis
[4668.26 → 4673.86] maintenance and repair of motorized land vehicles or marine vessels devices designed for consumers and
[4673.86 → 4679.70] medical devices on that latter point however they restricted the repair of video game consoles to
[4679.70 → 4685.78] optical drives only lame this is in response to a petition by I fix it in public knowledge complaining
[4685.78 → 4689.78] about how drives and motherboards are married to each other making repair significantly more difficult
[4690.34 → 4696.34] right but you guys are missing the point as soon as you create a carve out for one thing
[4697.22 → 4701.62] the manufacturers of these products that have demonstrated time and time and time and time again
[4701.62 → 4707.94] that they are willing to actually spend money to waste yours to build in these preventative
[4707.94 → 4713.14] measures to make sure that you can't repair your devices uh they've shown they're willing to do it
[4713.14 → 4717.46] so they're just gonna work around it again there was a there was a right to repair video made by
[4717.46 → 4722.18] I am very sorry if you're watching this somebody that I don't remember the name of um where they
[4722.18 → 4728.66] stacked a ton of PlayStation yeah and their whole thing it was like kind of like oh it's a challenge
[4728.66 → 4733.94] how many PlayStation can I stack outside in the wind, and he has like a ton of them, and he stacks
[4733.94 → 4738.98] this huge amount, and eventually they fall over and a bunch of them like get damaged, and he's like
[4738.98 → 4747.62] huh doesn't matter because I can't fix them because I'm like not allowed it's like wow that's brutal
[4747.62 → 4751.78] it was actually like perfect because you're like that's such a waste when you see them hit the
[4751.78 → 4756.50] ground right why would you do that yeah because they look in decent condition they're a little dusty or
[4756.50 → 4763.54] whatever sure yeah, but it's its just sad tropics fix JD's fix yeah yeah it was a perfect video
[4763.54 → 4770.02] because it made you kind of React right it's such a giant tower of electronics just get wasted onto
[4770.02 → 4777.54] the ground without the creator being wasteful which was so weird like your kind of want to be mad at the
[4777.54 → 4783.70] guy because he just wasted a bunch of consoles, but he didn't so you can't be i yeah I don't know
[4783.70 → 4792.02] such a frustrating situation I think I know this guy tropics fix yeah yeah I forgot his uh channel name
[4792.02 → 4796.34] but I've watched his stuff before perfect like not personally i just I'm pretty sure I've
[4796.34 → 4800.90] I'm pretty sure I've seen his stuff before it's good stuff yeah yeah perfect stuff definitely love
[4800.90 → 4807.38] it yeah all right you know this is perfect stuff it is finally time for us to uh go through
[4807.38 → 4814.58] some of these what are we calling them what are we didn't really uh what yeah what are we
[4814.58 → 4822.74] calling these LTT store chats or whatever we had some ideas okay um let's go with LTT store chat for
[4822.74 → 4826.74] now okay and I think you're going to have to do most of them because I accidentally closed the browser
[4826.74 → 4832.34] page, and they're gone okay yeah there's going to be there's going to be kind of a lot but hopefully some of
[4832.34 → 4837.06] them will at least prompt some discussion here do when you do super chats do you often say the
[4837.06 → 4842.82] person's name uh I would try to anonymize it a little bit just in case they submitted theirs anonymously
[4842.82 → 4846.82] so I would just go with like first name okay yeah I was going to say one of the one of the suggestions
[4846.82 → 4854.58] in flow plane chat uh was to do first name so maybe I'll go with that um Zachary says nice phone holder
[4854.58 → 4861.94] Linus when is LTT coming out with your own pc case line uh no time soon designing a pc case is
[4861.94 → 4867.70] extremely time-consuming and challenging, and ultimately it's going to be built by the same one of the same
[4867.70 → 4872.42] handful of manufacturers that actually has the equipment and expertise to build pc cases anyway so
[4872.98 → 4879.06] unless we had a really brilliant idea that we felt was a total game changer I don't see why we would
[4879.06 → 4885.22] get involved Ben says hello Linus thanks for the awesome streams can we get the file to the fold stand
[4885.22 → 4893.94] you're rocking tonight uh I mean you could try tweeting at nick cal Caliban um because he's the one who brought
[4893.94 → 4900.90] it over here so I'm assuming he knows something about where it came from uh at nick Caliban nick heavy on Twitter
[4900.90 → 4907.78] uh john says thanks to your team for what you're doing made says co-worker and I already bought
[4907.78 → 4913.46] wan hoodies this week, and he bought a wan lanyard thanks mate hey thanks mate uh Robert says hey gents
[4913.46 → 4919.78] hope you have a great show and great weekend Jeremy says thanks so much been waiting for a wan hoodie
[4920.98 → 4928.18] and he bought a bunch of stuff uh Alex big order says LGA bottle go brr
[4929.22 → 4935.94] LGA bottle LGA yeah LGA bottle oh oh oh that's right because the v2 of the water bottle
[4935.94 → 4942.50] um doesn't have a pin grid array socket on it it's its upgraded we've never actually I've never
[4942.50 → 4947.46] really talked about that in the videos or anything like that, but it's like oh that that's a v2 bottle
[4947.46 → 4954.58] right yeah yeah yeah so you can show it's yeah it's got a LGA socket now, and it's also got uh like
[4954.58 → 4962.58] memory um memory slots on both sides of the CPU socket hey it's quad channel, and it supports SLI
[4963.14 → 4967.86] and this old one's like AGP that was not actually something we did intentionally just
[4968.82 → 4976.50] our designer for these is not particularly tech-savvy and doesn't really desire to be so the motherboard
[4976.50 → 4981.86] graphic that was created originally was just based on a ancient motherboard for no real reason
[4981.86 → 4987.70] and then this time around some not as old motherboard was chosen for no particular reason
[4987.70 → 4993.78] so that so it ended up getting upgraded by the way apparently a name was chosen effectively by Conrad
[4993.78 → 4997.78] it could be changed but I actually like this one it's called merch messages okay merch messages there
[4997.78 → 5004.50] you go that's what that's what we're going to call it uh I'm going to say this guy's last name because
[5004.50 → 5011.22] he used it in his super chat um her heroin says heroin's naked to give heroin a shirt, and he bought a
[5011.22 → 5016.42] mystery shirt okay um all right yeah mystery shirts a good way I mean if is you're just
[5016.42 → 5022.26] naked, and your desperate mystery shirts a good way to go it works I mean at this point anything's
[5022.26 → 5030.34] an upgrade mystery shirt uh Ben says ordered my wan hoodie on Tuesday would love to see video resume
[5030.34 → 5035.78] on float plane ah yeah yeah and picture in iOS Jaden wants to work on that too uh what I would
[5035.78 → 5043.22] like done first is it remembering where I am scrolling through the comments' oh uh when i
[5043.22 → 5049.78] accidentally turn it or lock it that would be super, super amazing if Jaden's watching uh I think he is
[5050.34 → 5056.10] sub Jaden would love to hear some more updates on app development on float plane right now our app

[5131.70 → 5139.54] oh yeah uh is this going to be anticlimactic it's not in my bag okay like I actually took it out to show
[5139.54 → 5146.66] it to our uh our logistics uh company that we work with for decreasing our shipping cost to the US was in
[5146.66 → 5152.26] the office and I took it out to show it to him and I must have not put it back in my bag um the
[5152.26 → 5160.58] problem is not solved but our manufacturing partner for it is trying to put pressure on the folks that
[5160.58 → 5166.10] are building the ratchets which is the hold up right now, and hopefully it will be sooner than
[5166.10 → 5172.74] like late q1 of next year but no promises' oh yeah it's its been extremely delayed

[5216.98 → 5219.70] Brian says thanks for all the information you guys give love the show
[5221.54 → 5226.90] uh Joel says there's a software called Argus monitor that lets you set the chassis fan curve
[5226.90 → 5230.90] based on GPU temps or any other temp the computer can detect for anyone wanting to make their own
[5230.90 → 5237.54] knock to a GPU cooler yes I believe there are other pieces of software you can do that in as well but the reason
[5237.54 → 5241.06] I didn't and I had some people complaining about this in the video the reason I didn't was because
[5241.06 → 5247.38] I was running them at full speed and the performance still sucked so no amount of tuning the fan rpm
[5247.38 → 5251.78] was going to make it worth doing that was why I didn't bother to go down that path but yeah okay
[5251.78 → 5263.14] Argus cool tool thank you peter uh how ho how I'm going to go with how uh says loving the new
[5263.14 → 5275.06] make my name anonymous checkbox it's pronounced Hoff not how okay my bad wow oh my goodness there's some

[5546.02 → 5551.86] stuff like quantum computers and particle accelerators I'm sure Alex would be a hundred
[5551.86 → 5558.82] percent on the next plane over there I have toured a particle accelerator I filmed it they knew I was
[5558.82 → 5568.26] filming it as I left they said by the way no to all of that never show it I was like uh okay do I know
[5568.26 → 5575.30] about this uh I don't know maybe not what I was there for other reasons and then I took vacation time
[5575.30 → 5580.58] and then on my vacation time I toured this thing and I just brought my own camera it wasn't filmed
[5580.58 → 5585.78] well, but they yeah apparently like some people thought it was okay and then like someone higher
[5585.78 → 5592.50] up heard that it was happening and was like no, and it got like super killed do you still have the
[5592.50 → 5602.34] footage no oh so they like were like delete that now yes oh I see you mean no

[5648.50 → 5655.62] subscribe to they're just movies from William hey yeah good podcast good guys are on
[5655.62 → 5662.50] that podcast 3700x gang let's go in the days before the algorithm your friends are real Facebook
[5662.50 → 5667.70] showed every post by all of them in chronological order, and it was a good service from anonymous yeah
[5668.74 → 5675.70] I mean that last bit is still a little debatable um I liked Facebook when I was genuinely in high
[5675.70 → 5681.54] school Facebook was happening dude okay you know what I guess that's fair i maybe I just came into it a
[5681.54 → 5686.82] little bit late yeah I was quickly over Facebook I did not like Facebook anymore by the time I was in
[5686.82 → 5691.38] like post-secondary but like actual high school when it was brand-new right it was pretty cool
[5696.98 → 5702.98] been seeing you all wear the hoodie and have to have one looks epic hey please get David to model them
[5702.98 → 5712.82] winch face wow Dave got a secret admirer dang would like to see the sad Linus Sancho background one day
[5714.50 → 5720.66] um Sancho background I don't know like my door a lot of people think this is a green screen this is
[5720.66 → 5725.94] this is not a green screen it's not that is an actual wall and those doors are my actual wall I have
[5725.94 → 5733.06] a well I have a wall of doors so I'm not planning to move my wall of doors to the office yeah okay
[5733.06 → 5738.50] you got to go faster Luke uh I got my water bottle ltdstore.com love your products ltdstore.com
[5738.50 → 5744.98] soloing the wan hoodie versus stealth, and he got the wan hoodie um hope Anthony likes the fit oh I'm a
[5744.98 → 5749.78] similar body type and just want to be nice okay, okay I was like Anthony's been rocking it like every day
[5749.78 → 5755.70] since he got his sample so I think he's doing all right he must dig it um great new feature remember when it
[5755.70 → 5762.26] was super chat on a previous wan show can we get an answer on what the process of getting wan on
[5762.26 → 5768.42] float plane after it airs and why it takes longer than YouTube yeah Luke tell me okay you guys could
[5768.42 → 5773.54] have a better computer for this better computer for it well what's the problem with the computer I've
[5773.54 → 5779.62] I emailed you this oh right because there's the encoding errors yeah so this computer for some reason
[5779.62 → 5786.34] sends like over a hundred uh frames which my guys are looking at in chunks so that part doesn't matter
[5786.34 → 5791.86] but it sends chunks at the beginning of every single stream that are audio only which the trans
[5791.86 → 5796.82] coding does not like at all and then there's also like key frames later on in the video that just
[5796.82 → 5802.18] have massive gaps between them which the trans coding does not like at all so we're working on a
[5802.18 → 5809.78] system that will like to cleanse those problems um I don't think it's like prodded yet um but as of right
[5809.78 → 5815.06] now we're going to have to like manually download the file transcode it locally after cleaning it and
[5815.06 → 5820.50] then upload it back up again now we know that is the issue which is an advancement so that's good so it
[5820.50 → 5825.78] should go up a little bit faster this time, but there will still be a little bit of a delay um it is
[5825.78 → 5831.54] very annoying we have never experienced it with any stream ever other than coming back to the office
[5831.54 → 5836.42] and specifically streaming on this computer which is the same computer we used to stream wan show on
[5836.42 → 5842.50] it is not the like streaming cart that they do other streams on the other streams are fine
[5842.50 → 5851.30] they don't have a problem it's just this computer so I don't know okay so we're working on it basically
[5851.30 → 5859.78] yeah next level challenge daily drive gaming on a Mac no hope you like playing star craft I think that
[5859.78 → 5865.62] works I want to play that new uh that new game by the Final Fantasy 6 devs guy like lead dev or
[5865.62 → 5871.38] whatever lead project lead I forget fantasia or something like that oh I want to play it but I'm
[5871.38 → 5875.30] gonna wait till it comes out for a platform that I don't have to subscribe yeah because that's on the
[5875.30 → 5879.14] apple keep my save game right yeah I'm sure it'll come up for something else eventually
[5879.14 → 5885.54] okay this is long uh from Elliot hey Linus and Luke first time catching the show live and first
[5885.54 → 5892.98] super chat it's its a merch message um about the Linux challenge I know you want to do
[5892.98 → 5898.90] it without help but would you ever consider a collab with a Linux creator after it ends someone like nick
[5898.90 → 5905.62] from TLE Anthony knows him who has a lot of experience and great content focusing on uh desktop
[5905.62 → 5911.38] environments and user-friendliness could be nice to recommend for viewers looking to dive into it
[5911.38 → 5916.58] I mean I think we would absolutely consider collaborating with Linux channels but it
[5916.58 → 5920.58] wouldn't be on this channel I mean we have before we've collaborated with Wendell from level one text
[5921.46 → 5930.74] who's amazing he's the best um it's its just it's not part of this content series this content series
[5930.74 → 5938.66] is about not having access to those kinds of industry contacts and trying to go in and google
[5938.66 → 5944.74] for answers and research it on your own uh like i I mean I said right at the beginning of it if i
[5944.74 → 5953.78] wanted if I wanted help i could probably contact the lead dev for half a dozen different Linux
[5953.78 → 5959.30] distros within a matter of 48 hours if I was like hey I'm going to feature your distro in a video and they
[5959.30 → 5967.06] would hold my hand basically do everything for me that was not what i wanted to struggle
[5967.06 → 5972.66] I wanted trial by fire and this is not a new thing for reviewers to you have boy did I ever get it
[5972.66 → 5979.30] you have to seek authentic experiences yeah because you get kind of ambushed or sneak attacked by
[5979.30 → 5986.02] by companies that try to feed you golden samples that try to kind of fake customer service experience
[5986.02 → 5991.94] I mean that's why we had Janice and then Sarah act as our secret shoppers um you know we wanted to
[5991.94 → 5995.86] well there were a number of reasons that we chose them in particular one was that they
[5995.86 → 6000.98] legitimately are not super into computers so they wouldn't have to fake it or like fake the things
[6000.98 → 6009.94] they didn't know um two was that i was looking to kind of prey on any companies that heard a
[6009.94 → 6017.22] female voice and assumed anything about them yeah um you know I wanted to I wanted to catch any of
[6017.22 → 6024.42] that kind of behaviour um and three is that they at least at the time were not that recognizable I mean
[6024.42 → 6029.46] now they're both minor internet celebrities because a secret shopper, but they were not
[6029.46 → 6033.54] recognizable names because a lot of the time in order to order things you have to give your real name
[6033.54 → 6040.58] and so we needed to find a way around that because as soon as an order from Linus Sebastian comes into
[6040.58 → 6047.86] a system integrator you can bet your bottom dollar that that is going to get the white glove treatment
[6047.86 → 6051.62] just in case you should try it you should try to order a computer
[6055.06 → 6060.90] it's not a bad idea I mean it's like fraud so don't but is it I think so impersonating someone
[6060.90 → 6069.06] it's got to be like you're not allowed to place orders fraudulently and giving a false name when
[6069.06 → 6074.58] you place an order I don't think, but you wouldn't put the name on the credit card okay they'd check
[6074.58 → 6079.30] that the payment details would have to be different yeah yeah so I don't actually recommend
[6079.30 → 6086.66] falsifying your payment information but yeah yeah definitely not uh Jeremy says been doing the Linux
[6086.66 → 6090.82] gaming challenge with you guys that's actually really cool um he says all my trip
[6090.82 → 6095.62] AAA games are working great only game that is worked is star citizen uh, but that's not a
[6095.62 → 6101.94] significantly different experience from windows oh man we'll probably stick it out with Linux as
[6101.94 → 6113.62] long as I can cool all right that's super cool uh oh Anwar Anwar Anwar I'm going to go with Anwar said we
[6113.62 → 6123.46] need LTT NFTs on meta that's one of those sentences i I read an article today that uh the title was
[6124.42 → 6129.86] I'm a millennial and I don't recognize any of the words that they added to whatever dictionary today
[6130.58 → 6135.22] I feel like i I recognized most of them it was things like zero day like it's just like kind of
[6135.22 → 6139.62] technical terms like stuff that I know what it is so I wasn't like oh I'm so out of touch I'm a millennial
[6139.62 → 6148.26] but that sentence you just said is the kind of thing that what did that even mean nothing
[6148.26 → 6155.22] yeah I don't really um don't like the purchase pop-ups in the stream just use a rolling text at
[6155.22 → 6160.58] the bottom I daily drive Linux for a while now I usually run my system for up to three months with
[6160.58 → 6164.90] just hibernates no stability issues at all I never could do that with windows due to force updates
[6164.90 → 6170.18] instability well um the majority of games I've been installing on steam won't launch until i
[6170.18 → 6176.98] restart my computer, so our experiences are not necessarily the same there are maybe things we
[6176.98 → 6182.10] can change about the pop-up like right now it swipes off to the left or oh yeah maybe it should go up to
[6182.10 → 6186.74] the top it should go up whatever this is very much a gen one experience but oh yeah we're working on it
[6187.46 → 6193.70] it's fresh it's fresh sick hoodie thanks bro thanks for all your team and what they do from Benjamin
[6193.70 → 6198.18] Michael says finally I can get a wan show hoodie uh cadent his is a very important one says potato
[6199.38 → 6210.90] um sure love it okay we've made it far enough into just the like bull crap us reading merch messages
[6210.90 → 6217.46] and super chats and stuff um that I'm going to give you guys the heads-up because most people will not
[6217.46 → 6223.14] make it this deep into the wan show you guys are clearly dedicated oh my we do not have a ton of
[6223.14 → 6228.90] wan hoodies yeah um, so there 's's a couple mentions for the hoodie coming up in a couple
[6228.90 → 6235.86] videos that are coming next week my expectation is that the second anyone the second that mention
[6235.86 → 6243.06] drops we are going to sell out um we ordered um you know whatever you guys are you guys are the
[6243.06 → 6251.94] guys are the dedicated ones we ordered 4 000, and we have already sold over a thousand and so far all
[6251.94 → 6260.10] we've done to promote it is we tweeted once we sent out a message to previous LTT store buyers
[6260.90 → 6270.58] and we wore it today that is it and that might sound like a lot but compared to our plan yeah which was
[6270.58 → 6276.10] like the northern lights desk pad so compared to our plan where we were going to do a dedicated
[6276.10 → 6281.38] short circuit unboxing when we did the dedicated short circuit unboxing for northern lights' desk pad
[6281.94 → 6289.54] it was insane um and then remember for desk pad we also had like a making of video on LTT so
[6289.54 → 6295.78] we weren't planning that for the hoodie, but we were going to follow it up with a bunch of mentions in LTT
[6295.78 → 6301.38] videos we did two mentions realized that the sales velocity was way too high, and we were just going to
[6301.38 → 6307.62] be out of stock of the thing for like four months or something like that, so the next ship there is another
[6307.62 → 6314.90] shipment in production, but the problem is that it is not done yet so it will hopefully be done in some
[6314.90 → 6321.06] weeks and then after that it needs to be shipped here and that's probably it's heavy and bulky so
[6321.62 → 6328.82] shipping it via air is not that feasible it's its not very cost-effective um so it's probable that it'll
[6328.82 → 6334.34] end up on a c shipment which means that with all the ports and logistics delays around the world right now
[6334.34 → 6340.50] it could easily be like anywhere from I mean a month is normal so it could be anywhere from six
[6340.50 → 6348.58] to eight 12 16 weeks I don't know once it's done production so if you guys want one grab it um don't
[6348.58 → 6353.86] don't feel like you'll never get a chance again though this is an ongoing skew so if you don't have
[6353.86 → 6361.46] 90 right now don't spend it uh wait just know that you're going to have to wait for a while
[6361.46 → 6367.22] yeah so that second production is going to be another 4 000 units, and then we are currently
[6367.22 → 6374.98] talking to the factory about uh like a lot more yeah because I was blown away by the demand I mean
[6374.98 → 6379.70] we only sold well there was also that thing where you guys originally were expecting to receive this
[6379.70 → 6385.46] order in like more of a summer month yeah yeah yeah so we were expecting that it was going to be like
[6385.46 → 6392.10] summer selling hoodies so we kind of under ordered instead it's winter and q4, and we're
[6392.10 → 6395.62] selling hoodies so we thought we were going to already have the second shipment, and we thought we
[6395.62 → 6400.82] were already going to have some sales data to put together our future orders um but yeah it's its
[6400.82 → 6405.54] kind of blown us away because I know it was eight years ago or whatever but when we released wan hoodie
[6405.54 → 6411.78] originally we only had a total of like 700 units or something so 800 or something like that I don't
[6411.78 → 6415.78] remember how many it was, but it was the minimum quantity I remember I thought it was insane that
[6415.78 → 6422.10] we like bought that many noes and like seeing all the boxes of them I was like whoa this is crazy
[6422.10 → 6433.14] and now it's like over 10 times as much yeah it's its stupid now like LTT store is going crazy um
[6433.94 → 6440.66] and you guys are you guys are you guys are huge uh thank you very much, so yeah don't overdo it if you
[6440.66 → 6445.62] don't have the if you don't have the funds right now just don't just wait for the next one uh but
[6445.62 → 6453.14] if you were like waffling you're like oh maybe I'll order it next week or next when show so that i
[6453.14 → 6458.18] can do a merch message or whatever than I strongly would advise against that I want you to make sure

[6551.54 → 6560.50] oh Madison's been putting together some like very BS random videos for float plane exclusives
[6562.10 → 6568.02] heck yeah check it out they're exactly the kind of cringe you would expect uh, uh yes
[6568.02 → 6577.46] uh okay, okay um yeah so we're going to have to call it at some point here Luke we can't keep doing
[6577.46 → 6583.22] chats I'm kind of getting there actually okay I've got two really long ones to do um all right there's
[6583.22 → 6588.74] uh thanks for all the great this is from Ellen thanks for all the great content uh wan show over
[6588.74 → 6594.74] the years and recently BTS on float plane hey heck yeah I've been spending the last week unsuccessfully
[6594.74 → 6599.78] trying to diagnose hard crashes on my desktop that has been stable for years crashes so quickly no
[6599.78 → 6608.74] event logs other than boot from uh improper shutdown show up thinking the 49 or 46 90k is trying to give
[6608.74 → 6615.70] up the ghost the only uh visual identifier of failure has been minor HTML render issues in browsers that
[6615.70 → 6621.30] flash by sometimes this is a truly unfortunate time for anyone who's yeah for anyone who's played with
[6621.30 → 6627.38] dying hardware and picky taste for a replacement rig almost swore off tech from the crashes last
[6627.38 → 6632.90] weekend you know what it pays too well for my day job might actually not be as terrible a time as you
[6632.90 → 6639.86] might think because if alder lake is as good as intel says that is going to shave some serious value off of
[6639.86 → 6646.02] like something like dozen 2000 which is very respectable hardware still absolutely, and you might see some
[6646.02 → 6650.90] upgrades yeah yeah i I think now might not actually be a terrible time for you
[6653.70 → 6659.46] another one uh from Joel bit of a longer one a note on the knock to a GPU video there's a software
[6659.46 → 6663.54] called Argus I already read that one I think I caught up to you then oh did you uh nick is going to freak
[6663.54 → 6669.22] out if I don't show this to you guys we have our second edition of the leak the Linus tech tips
[6669.22 → 6675.70] store newsletter, so this is an update on screwdriver guys we made a lot of tough choices about our
[6675.70 → 6679.94] screwdriver in the two years we've been building it no we don't have a release date for you yet
[6680.58 → 6687.46] yes we are more disappointed than you are but um there's a really cool there's a really cool bit in
[6687.46 → 6692.34] here about screwdriver bits because that was something that we did a bunch of research into
[6692.34 → 6698.10] um I know for a lot of industries screwdriver bits are considered more of like a consumable
[6698.10 → 6705.06] right like you just you're putting them in power tools you're throwing them away like you know after a
[6705.06 → 6710.98] couple of days of use um but for like someone who builds pcs and that's all they do you actually
[6710.98 → 6715.94] basically forever a feature of your bits might actually be that they last for a really long time
[6715.94 → 6721.46] um and because we've got these shorty bits in the screwdriver we wanted to make sure that if people
[6721.46 → 6725.06] are careful with them and don't lose them that they wouldn't have to replace them any more often
[6725.06 → 6729.86] than possible or any more often than they absolutely have to so uh kyle actually wrote up
[6729.86 → 6736.66] um really cool little blurb about um the research that he did into titanium bits
[6737.22 → 6742.02] um you know whether they make any sense whether they're actually any better than steel what makes
[6742.02 → 6747.30] them better than steel or not better than steel, and it's uh just a really cool little
[6747.30 → 6751.86] write-up um so you guys are going to want to make sure that you go subscribe to the Linus tech
[6751.86 → 6757.46] tips store newsletter I talked to nick about it this week and I think that the goal for the newsletter is
[6757.46 → 6762.18] for every time we talk to you about something there to be an educational component whether it's
[6762.18 → 6767.86] learning about supply chain learning about material science like this one uh learning about design um
[6767.86 → 6772.66] I think having uh one of the ones I suggested to him was having Sarah talk through all the
[6772.66 → 6780.50] different colours of toques that she did not select for our new lineup and sort of why like what is it
[6780.50 → 6784.42] about these why do we choose these colours because it's fascinating and it's the kind of thing that if
[6784.42 → 6789.46] you're just browsing on a store you don't necessarily think about it as someone who might not be that
[6789.46 → 6795.94] into fashion not that I'm generalizing about our audience but it's quite possible that a lot of the
[6795.94 → 6800.74] stuff that um you know Bridget and Matthew and Sarah and Lloyd are working on could be some of your
[6800.74 → 6805.94] first exposure to sort of like a higher quality garment we see so many comments about the underwear
[6805.94 → 6811.54] that are like this is the best underwear ever and it is it's its good but there is stuff out
[6811.54 → 6816.98] there that's comparable if you were willing to pay like a whole ton of money for it um it's just that
[6816.98 → 6823.78] you know I get it like i i I was a Costco shop or Costco sock shopper for most of my life like i
[6823.78 → 6829.86] totally get it um, but there's a lot to this stuff that i just never really thought about until all of
[6829.86 → 6837.06] a sudden I was trying to i was trying to lead a business that creates it right just get you get
[6837.06 → 6843.30] thrown into it like that right so yeah go make sure you're subscribed and uh give it a
[6843.30 → 6848.42] read through um we're gonna we're going to try and make sure that the newsletter is not a waste of
[6848.42 → 6853.06] your time obviously there will be stuff like hey you should probably buy this because it's like a store
[6853.06 → 6858.50] newsletter but I want to make sure that it's content it's yet another content stream and I think that's
[6858.50 → 6863.30] pretty much it for Sancho today do you have anything else that you wanted to jump in with no, no there's
[6863.30 → 6869.62] a few more orders came in there's a bit there's a ton more but I did already tell people like the
