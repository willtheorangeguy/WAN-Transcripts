[0.00 → 7.56] and studios being closed. So this was, I mean, this was everywhere in the gaming news. So ours,
[8.02 → 15.10] Kodak, Kamasutra, that is an amazing name for a website, by the way. Everyone's reporting on
[15.10 → 20.02] this Google Stadia, Google's game streaming service that allows people to play modern games
[20.02 → 26.28] without a powerful PC, if you somehow hadn't heard of it, is changing the direction of its business.
[26.28 → 33.02] You know, the thing that's most kind of unbelievable about this to me, Luke, is Google
[33.02 → 37.20] taking a service that they just introduced and dramatically altering course.
[38.12 → 40.64] Yeah, or potentially just killing it off entirely.
[40.64 → 46.82] Like I'm getting whiplash. I'm getting whiplash here, you know. So Google is cancelling multiple
[46.82 → 53.12] projects, basically all the games that it had slated for release beyond 2021. Game studios in
[53.12 → 59.18] Montreal and LA will close, impacting about 150 developers. The company will apparently try to
[59.18 → 65.90] find them new roles at Google, though. And they will now offer their Stadia tech to tech publishers,
[66.20 → 70.88] allowing Stadia to become the streaming tech for other companies. So essentially white labelling
[70.88 → 75.74] the service. There were a number of games that were being developed by third party developers that
[75.74 → 83.76] got their funding pulled. So that's pretty sweet. And basically, okay, yeah, cool. So that's, that's
[83.76 → 92.46] pretty much the gist of it. But let's talk about what this means. Input Meg said, I think the company
[92.46 → 98.06] looked at the portfolio of original IP in progress and realized it was doomed to fail its first big test
[98.06 → 104.98] as a console maker, creating a mascot. That is a very interesting take. I have no idea why Alex Clark,
[105.46 → 110.18] one of our writers decided to put that particular take in here. So why don't we just come up with our
[110.18 → 114.16] own takes? Luke, give me your first impressions on this. What's the takeaway?
[114.92 → 120.16] I yeah, they need I think they needed to buy something. They're talking about how they needed a
[120.16 → 124.64] killer app, they need a mascot or whatever. Yeah, I think they needed to buy something. Microsoft has
[124.64 → 129.76] done a lot of purchasing game studios, and integrating those studios. I think that would
[129.76 → 135.04] have made a lot more sense making them part of the Xbox brand. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And like
[135.04 → 143.74] leading with a very big foot in that direction. Taking in companies like Bethesda. And I don't
[143.74 → 148.52] remember all the names of them, but some pretty like giant was it is Arcane Studios. Sorry, I can't
[148.52 → 152.24] remember all the names of it right off the top of my head. But like, they've made very big
[152.24 → 157.12] acquisition acquisitions in that space. Another thing that I think could have been a very large
[157.12 → 166.00] issue. And I hate to throw sand in this guy's direction again. But the creative director
[166.00 → 173.78] for SG&E, which is what's being shut down was Alex Hutchinson, who was the guy who was basically
[173.78 → 181.16] saying that like streamers need to pay game development studios. Yeah. All while using a like
[181.16 → 187.00] stolen piece of art as his cover photo for Twitter, like it was, it was terrible. And if that's the
[187.00 → 193.12] creative director for your company, and what you really need to make this succeed is creative direction.
[193.80 → 199.90] I'm concerned that that trust may have been misplaced. Those are my main two takeaways.
[199.90 → 206.76] They needed a thing, they needed a face for the platform. And, and the person who is potentially
[206.76 → 212.52] making the face for their platform made like one of the biggest negative splashes I've seen in the
[212.52 → 217.24] gaming space in a long time. So here's, yeah, here's one. And the gaming space has some big negative
[217.24 → 223.72] splashes. Here's my big problem with what they were doing. And you mentioned Microsoft and the way
[223.72 → 231.24] that they've been going on a game developer acquisition spree. When you're Google, when you're Google,
[231.24 → 241.24] you have literally more than a hundred billion dollars in the bank. Why don't you just go like,
[241.24 → 247.16] okay, here, here's a here's just, this is totally, totally off base and maybe totally ignorant,
[247.16 → 255.90] but like how much is Sega's like total market cap? Okay. Like what is, what is Sega worth?
[255.90 → 262.62] Uh, market cap 3.8 billion. And I don't think you even, I don't think you even would have to
[262.62 → 266.86] acquire a company for its market cap. I don't remember what sort of the rough calculation.
[267.34 → 273.92] And I bet you Sega has divisions. Sure. Because I know Sega has like physical stores in Japan and
[273.92 → 279.30] stuff. So I don't think Google cares about that, but Sega Sammy, I actually have no idea what Sega,
[279.48 → 283.12] Sega Sammy is. Sega Sammy holdings. And maybe, maybe that's it. Anyway, the point is,
[283.12 → 290.36] it doesn't matter. You have a hundred billion dollars. Anything is for sale for the right price.
[290.84 → 296.82] So whether it's, you know, one of those Chinese developers right now that is absolutely knocking
[296.82 → 300.82] it out of the park. I forget what article I was reading the other night, but there's like a Chinese
[300.82 → 306.28] adventure slash RPG game, like kind of a breath of the wild clone. It's the second that I've heard
[306.28 → 310.74] about in the last like couple of months. That's apparently just, Jonathan plays it. Oh no,
[310.74 → 314.02] it's a different one. It's a different one. This is a Chinese only one right now that like just
[314.02 → 320.32] launched, and it's like crushing it. Like there, there's got to be a game. And I realize acquiring
[320.32 → 326.14] Chinese companies is complicated. I'm just saying there has got to be an acquisition opportunity
[326.14 → 332.44] right there. We just go in, and you say, look, we need a flagship. Let's go. Obviously you're not
[332.44 → 337.96] going to be able to buy a Mario or a Gordon Freeman or, you know, one of those very, very expensive
[337.96 → 342.18] IPs. Yeah. But you, you even, okay. So just to interject right here, you mentioned Sega, and it's
[342.18 → 347.34] actually kind of interesting because when you and I were playing, uh, Anna over the weekend,
[347.34 → 352.58] I mentioned a company that was developing a Civ competitor game. Do you remember that?
[352.98 → 353.22] Yep.
[353.86 → 357.72] I couldn't remember what it was called. It was called Humankind. And it's actually kind of interesting
[357.72 → 364.52] for this particular conversation because Humankind, uh, is being developed by Sega or sorry, it's
[364.52 → 368.60] being developed by Amplitude Studios, and it's being published by Sega. Sorry, wrong, wrong way around.
[368.92 → 376.12] Um, but it was, it was like alpha or beta tested or something on Stadia, I believe exclusively.
[377.04 → 386.22] So they like sort of thought about working on it, but you need more than a 4X game and a 4X game
[386.22 → 392.42] probably isn't going to be like the face of your studio. Yeah, probably not. So they like sort of
[392.42 → 398.64] dipped their toe in, but like most people didn't even know about it, and it really wasn't far enough.
[398.88 → 405.34] To me, the bigger problem here is just that Google is so, so, so that's one way that they could have,
[405.40 → 409.62] so people are pointing out that buying Sega wouldn't be allowed because the Japanese government
[409.62 → 416.20] is extremely protective of Japanese companies. So, okay, fine. I'm just saying, I'm sure someone,
[416.22 → 420.50] someone somewhere would have been willing to make a deal if they were to go try and find like a
[420.50 → 428.78] franchise to, to make their own. Okay. So failing that, failing that they just had to not be such
[428.78 → 436.42] chicken. Google does this all the time. They go, okay, no, really for real. We're committed this time.
[436.42 → 442.66] We're going to do it this time. And the pitch for Stadia, like really the pitch for cloud gaming in
[442.66 → 448.76] general to me, if you want it to truly take off is that it was supposed to deliver gaming experiences
[448.76 → 454.28] that were otherwise impossible. And Luke, you and I have talked about this on the WAN show a lot of
[454.28 → 461.34] times, but there are truly gaming experiences, like really massively multiplayer gaming experiences, or
[461.34 → 469.44] like, like, like with highly interactive environments, for example, that would simply not be possible with a client
[469.44 → 478.72] running on, you know, potentially unknown or, or, or sort of unequal hardware all over the world. And then
[478.72 → 484.84] trying to synchronize through a server where you'd be far better off with the game world itself running on the
[484.84 → 491.84] server locally, and then having everybody removing into it. And just like control and control clients.
[492.44 → 500.66] Yeah, exactly. Well, like exactly what Stadia is. So having thin clients that are just, uh, interacting with this, with
[500.66 → 508.84] this just enormous, you know, game world that like, I mean, so, you know, Luke, one of the holy grails of gaming would be
[508.84 → 514.56] fully destructible environments. And there are ways that you can kind of get close. I mean, I'd say the
[514.56 → 519.78] the closest thing would be something like a Minecraft to, uh, to a game with a fully destructible environment
[519.78 → 528.02] that is really, that is really core to the gameplay. But that's a Lego game, essentially. And to be clear,
[528.08 → 532.70] I know, I know there's way more depth to Minecraft than digital Lego.
[532.70 → 536.50] So many people just, yeah. Okay, boomer. Okay, boomer.
[538.30 → 544.78] Yes, I know. What I mean to say, though, is that we're not, when you, when you destroy something in
[544.78 → 551.02] Minecraft, you're doing it block by block. You're not talking about objects physically interacting with
[551.02 → 551.54] each other.
[551.54 → 551.78] You can use TMG.
[552.14 → 558.72] Yeah, in realistic ways. That's not what we're talking about. But with Stadia, that's something
[558.72 → 564.82] that if you threw enough horsepower at it, maybe you could actually do, like, that would be so cool.
[565.66 → 569.08] Yeah, and they have a lot of, like, we, I mean, we had Battlefield Bad Company,
[569.66 → 573.24] um, which did, like, a, an amazing job at the time.
[573.60 → 573.76] Yep.
[573.76 → 575.70] Uh, when it, it's, it's quite old now.
[575.80 → 578.16] Rainbow Six Siege, same story, slightly newer.
[578.16 → 580.34] Rainbow Six Siege, there's a certain amount of stuff that's destructible.
[580.54 → 582.50] But it's often very limited.
[582.70 → 583.40] And scripted.
[583.40 → 584.70] It's not fully destructible. Yes.
[584.86 → 585.22] Exactly.
[585.22 → 586.96] It's very limited.
[586.96 → 589.68] What you're talking about is, like, full-on destruction.
[589.84 → 591.60] You can blow the building down if you need to.
[591.68 → 595.98] I'm talking about, like, a, like a prison, prison escape simulator.
[596.48 → 596.84] Okay?
[596.96 → 602.30] Where, literally, you could have, you know, this mega prison of a thousand prisoners.
[602.50 → 602.76] Okay?
[602.90 → 607.48] And it's this gaming experience where everybody, you know, kind of like a wow raid or whatever.
[607.66 → 607.86] Okay?
[608.08 → 614.04] So, everybody starts the game knowing that this is going to be a five or, like, a six-hour round.
[614.04 → 614.40] Right?
[614.82 → 621.16] And so, it's, it's like, okay, the prisoners have to manage to get, like, enough spoons or whatever.
[621.96 → 624.00] And, and, and shanks.
[624.22 → 627.08] And, like, there's this, no, I'm serious, though.
[627.34 → 627.72] Oh, my God.
[627.72 → 628.18] No, seriously.
[628.18 → 629.64] I would, I would probably play this.
[629.64 → 630.16] You're laughing.
[630.28 → 631.18] But I'm, I'm serious.
[631.32 → 634.00] Like, doesn't that sound like an amazing gaming experience?
[634.00 → 638.40] And, meanwhile, so, the guards are outnumbered, you know, 30 to 1 or whatever it is.
[638.48 → 640.00] But they've got all these tools.
[640.20 → 643.08] You could have all this voice chat and interaction.
[643.52 → 644.70] You know, kind of like Among Us.
[644.72 → 646.88] You could have rules with respect to voice chat.
[646.92 → 652.12] So, you would have to actually sit down, like, at a comes terminal in order to, to move your guards around.
[652.22 → 653.92] You'd have a limited number of views.
[654.32 → 655.70] Like, an experience, like...
[655.70 → 659.50] You have, like, proximity chat so that the guards and the prisoners can, like, beak each other and stuff.
[659.50 → 661.60] Exactly, exactly.
[662.22 → 665.54] Apparently, there's a game called Teardown, which is fully destructible.
[665.64 → 667.34] So, we can go have a quick look at that.
[667.62 → 669.80] Okay, but that's, that's built into the name.
[669.94 → 671.72] So, that's probably, like, all it is.
[674.96 → 675.36] Okay.
[676.68 → 678.16] That's my, that's my concern.
[678.46 → 680.08] Looks very Lego blocky as well.
[680.18 → 682.66] Okay, so, I don't know enough about this game to comment on it.
[683.46 → 685.28] Teardown, satisfying destruction.
[685.62 → 687.38] Okay, so, I'd have to, I'd have to have a look at this.
[687.38 → 689.38] I think I saw this on, I think I saw the creator.
[689.50 → 690.42] Talking about this on Imgur.
[690.52 → 692.50] But, yeah, it's still very block based.
[692.62 → 693.54] It's really cool.
[693.66 → 694.36] Very cool looking.
[694.36 → 695.50] It looks, it looks really cool.
[695.60 → 697.14] The how the lighting interacts with things.
[697.34 → 698.34] Visual style is really nice.
[699.14 → 702.24] Yeah, but you can still, it's very chunky, very blocky.
[702.30 → 704.02] You can still see that, which is, I mean, it's great.
[704.20 → 705.26] It looks, it looks sweet.
[705.64 → 707.44] The reviews all look very, very positive.
[707.58 → 708.24] That's fantastic.
[708.42 → 709.72] I'm happy for the people that made it.
[710.08 → 714.48] But, like, you see this car get shot by the helicopter, and it's, like, it's, it's cubes.
[714.48 → 715.20] It's made out of cubes.
[715.20 → 721.48] The point is, the killer app for cloud gaming was supposed to be gaming experiences that
[721.48 → 722.98] we couldn't otherwise achieve.
[723.18 → 725.02] That was, that was the sales pitch.
[725.28 → 732.36] And what Google needed to do is understand that it was going to take time and have some
[732.36 → 736.36] f***ING patience for a change because they just, it's, they just can't do it.
[736.58 → 737.90] It's, like, they just can't do it.
[737.90 → 743.90] Like, okay, let's say, for example, that I had a Google-like mindset and I wanted to
[743.90 → 747.10] do something like develop a commercial property.
[747.24 → 747.48] Okay.
[747.88 → 756.54] So the way that works is when and if you can acquire any land, which could take you years,
[756.80 → 762.70] you then have to create a proposal for what exactly you would do it, how exactly you would
[762.70 → 763.02] do it.
[763.02 → 767.96] You have to get that approved by the city, which could take six months to two years.
[768.14 → 771.82] You have to get a bunch of, like, due diligence done.
[771.92 → 774.60] You have to get an architect to design something.
[774.72 → 777.74] You have to get an engineer to actually make it buildable.
[777.86 → 780.10] You then have to get the city to approve that again.
[780.48 → 781.74] Then you break ground.
[782.12 → 787.66] Then you have to get approvals and inspections at every phase in this process from actually
[787.66 → 789.32] deciding, hmm, you know what?
[789.32 → 795.16] I'd love to have, like, a building to operate my business out of to walking through the front
[795.16 → 799.78] door and, like, plugging in your laptop and sitting down and working is a process that
[799.78 → 805.32] can take anywhere from 36 to 72 months, realistically.
[806.12 → 808.90] So Google's the kind of company that goes, you know what?
[809.32 → 811.60] We should have, like, a really nice headquarters.
[812.12 → 812.94] Let's get started.
[812.94 → 820.06] Two years later, three years later, the work site is covered in bulldozers and a Google
[820.06 → 825.64] executive kind of shows up in a nice car, gets out and is like, hey, you know what?
[826.00 → 828.36] This really isn't working out the way that we'd like.
[829.00 → 830.02] Sorry about that.
[830.12 → 830.64] See you later.
[831.36 → 833.64] Like, that's the way they are.
[833.78 → 838.60] Or, or, or they, like, they do something, like, even dumber, and they'll just be like,
[838.60 → 839.64] hey, you know what?
[840.22 → 841.12] Great job, guys.
[841.22 → 841.72] Keep it up.
[841.92 → 848.16] We're going to start another, a mostly identical job site next door, and we want you guys to
[848.16 → 853.06] compete with them, and we're going to see who goes the fastest because that's how you get
[853.06 → 854.60] the best product, apparently.
[855.08 → 858.48] Like, that's the it's just, their mindset is so frustrating.
[858.74 → 859.44] They had to know.
[859.78 → 860.78] Everybody knows.
[861.32 → 862.06] I know.
[862.32 → 865.24] And I'm, I'm an idiot when it comes to game development.
[865.38 → 867.52] Luke, am I an idiot when it comes to game development?
[867.52 → 868.24] Help me out here.
[869.14 → 869.54] Probably.
[869.88 → 870.44] So am I.
[870.62 → 871.12] There you go.
[871.22 → 871.44] Okay.
[871.72 → 876.86] But do I know, and do you know that developing an AAA game takes five years if you're lucky?
[877.92 → 878.28] Yeah.
[878.52 → 878.84] Yeah.
[878.96 → 881.46] A lot of, I mean, look at Starfield.
[881.62 → 882.36] Is it called Starfield?
[882.68 → 883.50] Bethesda's new game.
[885.12 → 887.60] It was announced years ago.
[887.78 → 893.90] It was announced in E3 2018 and people aren't expecting it to be coming until like the late
[893.90 → 895.00] 2020s.
[895.00 → 902.80] Um, if we look at, uh, uh, Skull and Bones, I've been really, really excited about this
[902.80 → 904.10] game for a long time.
[904.22 → 906.96] Uh, its initial release date has been pushed back a few times.
[907.04 → 908.94] It's currently saying March 2021.
[909.26 → 913.44] This had a gameplay trailer in 2018.
[913.44 → 918.14] It had 23 minutes of gameplay shared with IGN in 2018.
[919.56 → 920.84] Games take forever.
[920.84 → 927.42] And, and, and what Google was theoretically trying to do was something that hadn't been
[927.42 → 928.08] done before.
[928.56 → 932.26] So optimistically that was going to take 10 years.
[932.26 → 938.22] So instead of like launching based on that promise, they had to take a slower and steadier
[938.22 → 943.34] approach, know that they were going to have to be reliant on current gaming experiences for
[943.34 → 946.44] a very long time and freaking stick it out.
[946.44 → 952.22] Because if they made the investment and if they pulled it off, it had the potential to
[952.22 → 953.60] be an absolute gold mine.
[953.60 → 958.68] As it is, they are getting their lunches absolutely eaten by Nvidia.
[959.54 → 963.20] So, uh, meanwhile, some GeForce Now numbers here.
[963.40 → 964.52] Uh, hold on a second.
[964.62 → 965.24] Where, where is it?
[965.74 → 966.66] GeForce Now.
[966.82 → 967.30] Ah, yes.
[967.34 → 967.56] Okay.
[967.60 → 969.08] So this is one of our other news topics.
[969.66 → 975.84] GeForce Now has reached 6 million members by its one-year anniversary of coming out of
[975.84 → 976.08] beta.
[976.08 → 982.70] So it launched publicly in February 2020, uh, they've got over 175 million hours of
[982.70 → 983.72] games streamed.
[983.72 → 987.46] They now support over 800 titles with 30 new games coming this month.
[987.46 → 991.48] And starting today, the Chrome browser has support for GeForce Now, and that's coming
[991.48 → 992.88] to Windows and macOS.
[993.26 → 997.90] The latest client also includes support for Macs with the Apple M1 chip through Rosetta
[997.90 → 998.30] 2.
[999.12 → 1003.56] And, uh, I mean, it doesn't require the purchase of a console.
[1003.56 → 1006.48] You can use basically any controller you want.
[1006.58 → 1007.66] It's extremely flexible.
[1008.72 → 1013.96] This approach and Microsoft's approach, as someone put in here under my thoughts, I think
[1013.96 → 1016.20] are much healthier and much better approaches.
[1016.48 → 1022.36] Um, Microsoft honestly has been winning a lot of hearts in the gaming side of things.
[1022.36 → 1028.28] I think for a while now, allowing people to play on multiple platforms, uh, the games.
[1028.42 → 1028.84] That's great.
[1028.84 → 1029.34] Isn't it?
[1029.82 → 1031.56] Cross-licensing the games is amazing.
[1031.56 → 1035.40] Um, them, them making it so that you can, you can play through the cloud.
[1035.48 → 1036.34] You can play through your computer.
[1036.46 → 1037.26] You can play through your Xbox.
[1037.46 → 1038.96] They just want you to be able to play games.
[1039.22 → 1046.70] That is a much more, uh, I'm at risk of using a wrong term for this, but it feels like a
[1046.70 → 1050.84] much more wholesome approach to gaming than we've had for a long time from a lot of studios.
[1050.84 → 1055.58] A lot of studios just seem to try to loot as much as they possibly can and just take from
[1055.58 → 1058.20] you everything and give as little back as possible.
[1058.68 → 1059.22] EA games.
[1059.64 → 1064.66] Um, but Microsoft seems to be at least spinning that around a little bit that you can play
[1064.66 → 1065.88] on whatever platform you want.
[1065.94 → 1067.18] It's, it's, it's better.
[1067.28 → 1067.92] Check this out, Luke.
[1068.42 → 1074.00] The Xbox Series X, in spite of the supply issues that have gamers understandably upset,
[1074.00 → 1082.42] the Xbox Series X has 8,500 reviews on bestbuy.com with an average rating of 4.8 stars.
[1083.56 → 1089.40] I mean, you can, you can say, okay, you can say, yeah, Microsoft has been putting consumers
[1089.40 → 1096.20] first and has been trying to, trying to ditch an image of, you know, nickel and dining gamers
[1096.20 → 1098.14] for every last, every last penny.
[1098.28 → 1101.04] But like, look at, look at this, look at this.
[1101.42 → 1102.92] This is, this is such a cool move.
[1102.92 → 1106.08] I mean, we talked about this a fair bit in the lead up to the launch of the Series X.
[1106.62 → 1111.78] Not only can you reuse your old controllers, which is so consumer and environmentally friendly.
[1112.36 → 1112.72] Yeah.
[1112.96 → 1117.20] But they only charge you if you don't have an old controller to, to, to use now.
[1117.30 → 1119.56] They only charge you 50 bucks US for a controller.
[1119.90 → 1124.46] Like that is one of the I remember being absolutely shocked because one of the first,
[1124.56 → 1129.54] actually the first game console I ever bought for myself as an adult was a Nintendo Wii.
[1129.54 → 1134.72] And the Nintendo Wii was, wasn't it like 250 bucks or something like that?
[1134.78 → 1136.32] Like the console itself was cheap.
[1137.02 → 1137.10] Yeah.
[1137.20 → 1142.44] But by the time you kidded yourself out with four Wii motes, four classic controllers.
[1142.92 → 1145.50] And was there anything else in terms of accessories?
[1145.80 → 1149.62] A pair of Switch controllers right now is a hundred Canadian dollars.
[1149.62 → 1158.84] A single Joy-Con, which like really isn't enough for almost anything is 53 Canadian dollars.
[1159.92 → 1164.74] The pro controllers are actually, actually that's a third party controller.
[1164.90 → 1165.06] Yeah.
[1165.12 → 1166.78] No, the pro controllers are super expensive.
[1166.88 → 1168.46] They're like a hundred Canadian dollars each.
[1169.16 → 1169.42] Yeah.
[1169.52 → 1171.74] And a single Joy-Con is 40 US dollars.
[1171.74 → 1173.00] So hold on.
[1173.04 → 1173.58] Let me find out.
[1173.64 → 1176.06] Let me find a Switch pro controller in America here.
[1177.82 → 1178.22] America.
[1181.56 → 1181.92] Here.
[1181.98 → 1183.02] Do you think we can line this up?
[1183.14 → 1183.54] We think, okay.
[1183.64 → 1185.02] 70, 70 US dollars.
[1185.48 → 1189.42] So Microsoft's doing a great job of winning hearts and minds of gamers.
[1189.54 → 1192.94] Now all they need to do is have some of those game studio acquisitions pay off for them.
[1192.94 → 1197.86] So they have some freaking platform exclusive games, except they won't because they're finally
[1197.86 → 1200.04] respecting PC gamers, which is super cool.
[1200.04 → 1201.12] By the way, Luke.
[1201.22 → 1201.36] Okay.
[1201.44 → 1201.94] So hold on.
[1202.00 → 1203.84] I want you to, we're going to, we're going to try and time this.
[1203.90 → 1204.08] Okay.
[1204.42 → 1206.12] So you got to, you got to sing the song again.
[1206.14 → 1207.06] I got to try and beep you.
[1207.24 → 1207.44] Okay.
[1207.48 → 1207.66] Ready?
[1207.80 → 1208.02] Okay.
[1208.40 → 1209.28] I'm saying the whole thing.
[1209.44 → 1209.56] Yeah.
[1209.56 → 1209.76] Yeah.
[1209.76 → 1210.00] Yeah.
[1210.00 → 1210.16] Yeah.
[1210.16 → 1210.24] Yeah.
[1210.24 → 1210.64] Go for it.
[1210.64 → 1211.20] Go for it.
[1211.32 → 1211.46] Yeah.
[1211.48 → 1211.60] Yeah.
[1211.60 → 1212.00] Go for it.
[1212.02 → 1213.16] I'm going to get the timing right.
[1213.42 → 1214.62] Live, live, live censoring.
[1214.68 → 1215.04] Here we go.
[1215.50 → 1215.68] Okay.
[1215.68 → 1215.98] You ready?
[1216.16 → 1216.34] Yep.
[1216.42 → 1216.62] Yep.
[1217.66 → 1218.06] Mekka.
[1218.72 → 1219.40] Fuck yeah.
[1219.60 → 1220.42] Oh, it doesn't work.
[1220.74 → 1222.54] I cannot beep over top of you.
[1222.62 → 1223.28] So that's awkward.
[1223.42 → 1223.74] All right.
[1223.74 → 1223.92] Cool.
[1223.96 → 1225.68] Why don't we move into our next topic here?
[1227.24 → 1233.20] NVIDIA is requiring companies to be transparent about RTX 3000 specs.
[1233.58 → 1235.94] So the source here is the verge.
[1236.64 → 1242.38] And yes, I know, I know, but actually they've done a pretty good job of getting, of digging
[1242.38 → 1243.00] into this.
[1245.08 → 1246.46] NVIDIA previously.
[1246.66 → 1246.82] Okay.
[1246.88 → 1251.44] So if you don't know what's going on with RTX 30 series, then you probably didn't watch
[1251.44 → 1252.06] the WAN show.
[1252.14 → 1253.70] I think it was last week, but yeah.
[1253.74 → 1259.82] In a nutshell, there's like, yeah, there's well over a dozen different SKUs of these
[1259.82 → 1263.54] mobile RTX 30 GPUs total, like well over a dozen.
[1263.96 → 1269.58] And even though you've only got like 30, 60, 30, 70, 30, 80, and then even max Q, max P,
[1269.72 → 1274.40] which is for performance, theoretically, that's only six, but there's like way more than that
[1274.40 → 1277.06] because there's all these different TDPs that they can run at.
[1277.48 → 1283.36] Now in the past, NVIDIA encouraged, but did not require manufacturers of laptops
[1283.36 → 1289.44] to be transparent about the actual technical specifications of the GPUs that they were
[1289.44 → 1289.96] including.
[1290.32 → 1292.70] It is now completely mandatory.
[1292.70 → 1297.08] So this is a good step in the right direction, but he's not working.
[1297.08 → 1298.94] So he really doesn't have to take my call.
[1298.94 → 1305.12] I'd actually love to have one of my writers join us for this conversation because this doesn't
[1305.12 → 1307.68] necessarily completely solve the problem.
[1309.36 → 1310.28] Hold on a second.
[1310.40 → 1312.38] Let's just, let's just see if he picks up.
[1312.38 → 1317.60] Hello?
[1317.60 → 1317.72] Hello?
[1318.24 → 1321.84] Hey, I know you're not working right now, but do you, do you want to talk for a couple
[1321.84 → 1325.48] minutes on the WAN show about sort of near and dear to your heart topic?
[1327.16 → 1328.18] Uh, sure.
[1328.38 → 1329.42] If you're busy, it's fine.
[1329.50 → 1330.56] It really is fine.
[1331.62 → 1333.10] No, I'm just driving right now.
[1333.28 → 1333.88] Okay, chill.
[1334.36 → 1335.26] Um, all right.
[1335.30 → 1340.44] So we're talking about NVIDIA now requiring companies to be transparent about their RTX
[1340.44 → 1341.98] 3000 specs, right?
[1342.38 → 1344.40] So they actually have to disclose the TDP.
[1344.68 → 1350.34] Now, do you want to share with me a little anecdote that, uh, I was on my way to the bathroom
[1350.34 → 1352.68] and, uh, Alex's desk is right next to the bathroom.
[1352.82 → 1354.18] It's not as bad as it sounds.
[1354.24 → 1356.76] He actually chose that desk because it has more space.
[1357.16 → 1358.40] Um, you know, and it's fine.
[1358.44 → 1360.62] We have actually a pretty, it's a pretty solid door.
[1360.62 → 1362.36] So you can't hear too much grunting.
[1362.36 → 1366.18] Anyway, the point is I walked past his desk, and he tells me this story.
[1366.26 → 1366.68] So go ahead.
[1366.78 → 1367.76] Hit us with the story.
[1370.16 → 1374.92] Oh, well, I don't know if this is valid anymore because it turns out that the BIOS was just
[1374.92 → 1376.26] broken on both of them.
[1376.78 → 1381.32] It was like AMD's BIOS rollout was just garbage.
[1381.32 → 1392.60] But as of the last time that I tested the 80 watt TDP, uh, 3080 had about four FPS less than
[1392.60 → 1394.72] the 150 watt one.
[1395.78 → 1401.24] And they're both boosting to about the same core clocks thereabouts.
[1401.50 → 1404.38] It kind of just depends on like the thermals.
[1404.52 → 1407.12] It seems has nothing to do with like the actual TDP.
[1407.12 → 1408.38] Right.
[1409.70 → 1410.10] Okay.
[1410.28 → 1415.88] So basically what we had learned, but now we are apparently not sure if it's a hundred percent
[1415.88 → 1416.34] true.
[1416.54 → 1421.00] Uh, so we're going to have to get back to you guys on that one is that even though you might
[1421.00 → 1424.44] get an RTX 3080, whatever watt.
[1424.64 → 1424.92] Okay.
[1424.92 → 1431.20] So that's like the, the TDP, it seems like the actual performance, like we've seen with
[1431.20 → 1437.20] even their desktop GPUs over the last number of years really comes down to the GPU boosting
[1437.20 → 1439.84] to whatever the heck it wants.
[1440.68 → 1442.24] And that's what you're going to get.
[1442.24 → 1448.18] So if you will go, and you throw like 150 watt thermal solution on an 80 watt 3080, you might
[1448.18 → 1453.08] actually get very similar performance to if you put 150 watt thermal solution on a on
[1453.08 → 1455.58] a quote unquote 150 watt 3080.
[1456.00 → 1457.82] But I guess that kind of makes sense.
[1458.32 → 1461.66] Um, do we think that maybe, yeah, go ahead.
[1461.66 → 1467.76] I should also say that the 80 watt one was a lot louder when it was doing that.
[1467.86 → 1473.16] That was like fans cranked and overclocked in the Asus like tuning thing.
[1473.48 → 1477.68] It was more like nine FPS lower.
[1478.28 → 1484.80] So I think it was like 81 FPS versus 90 on overclocked, but it's the sort of thing where
[1484.80 → 1489.22] like if you want the performance, you can just turn the fans up and it's there.
[1489.22 → 1492.72] Right. And then you just also have a much thinner, lighter laptop.
[1493.76 → 1494.16] Yeah.
[1494.88 → 1496.36] Okay. All right. Thanks, Alex.
[1497.06 → 1498.06] You have a good weekend.
[1498.28 → 1498.62] All right.
[1499.48 → 1499.80] You too.
[1501.32 → 1508.12] So what we don't know though, is if there's some kind of price difference for laptop manufacturers
[1508.12 → 1513.72] and if there's some kind of power advantage, like, um, I mean, power consumption advantage
[1513.72 → 1518.74] to getting one of these like 80 watt versus 150 watt chips.
[1518.74 → 1521.00] So maybe there's some binning that's taking place.
[1521.12 → 1528.56] Either way, what we're learning is that there is still a lot more to learn about mobile RTX 3000 series.
[1528.86 → 1535.50] This is not something that has been simple, clearly for Nvidia and their partners to work into mobile devices.
[1536.14 → 1537.84] Um, there's a couple more news items here.
[1538.04 → 1538.74] Nvidia says,
[1538.74 → 1545.68] We are requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the max Q technology features for each GeForce laptop,
[1545.68 → 1550.90] as well as clocks and power, which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system.
[1550.90 → 1553.16] So it's a step in the right direction.
[1553.82 → 1560.22] But based on Alex's anecdote about finding that if he just like turned it into like boost mode
[1560.22 → 1565.40] or whatever Asus calls that on that particular model, uh, the performance completely changes.
[1565.40 → 1572.38] We just, we just don't really know exactly what we're dealing with until we have an industry-wide measure.
[1572.38 → 1582.20] That's like, uh, you know, however many Fortnite FPSs or I, I, I don't know what that would end up looking like.
[1582.20 → 1592.78] So the Verge references how their MSI GP66 Leopard with an RTX 3070 was able to outperform an MSI GS66 Stealth with an RTX 3080
[1592.78 → 1596.24] and that it would not be possible to tell that from specs alone.
[1596.38 → 1598.08] So they're keeping an eye on it.
[1598.28 → 1601.72] We're going to be keeping an eye on it, but there's part of the problem.
[1601.72 → 1603.92] I'm sure you'll hear more about this on WAN Show in the future.
[1604.06 → 1605.46] This has been an ongoing conversation.
[1605.46 → 1614.10] I do enjoy how they like, NVIDIA has been like repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot with, with all these like weird naming setups.
[1614.38 → 1622.64] And, uh, their, their end result of that was like, we're requiring the, the, the other companies to be transparent about the performance.
[1622.64 → 1626.92] Like just pushing so much responsibility onto other people.
[1627.04 → 1628.62] I understand like they do.
[1629.08 → 1631.22] I, I think it is the right move.
[1631.40 → 1634.52] I just find the wording around it kind of funny.
[1634.52 → 1637.78] Um, because it, it makes it kind of sound like it was.
[1637.92 → 1638.40] It's still there.
[1638.40 → 1638.96] Something wrong.
[1639.16 → 1639.70] The whole time.
[1639.92 → 1640.18] Yeah.
[1640.48 → 1640.86] Yeah.
[1640.94 → 1641.06] Yeah.
[1641.06 → 1646.72] And has nothing to do with NVIDIA releasing more than a dozen SKUs across three different model names.
[1647.18 → 1647.42] Yeah.
[1647.42 → 1654.30] Not having a clear difference, um, you know, in the, in the actual product marketing.
[1654.80 → 1656.80] So, you know, good job NVIDIA.
[1656.94 → 1660.20] Glad you're sort of working on fixing this up.
[1660.46 → 1663.92] Um, I, I wish you had made it more clear in the first place.
[1663.92 → 1669.14] I, I mean, honestly, what we really need is, and this is going to sound crazy.
[1669.54 → 1670.66] I'm about to sound crazy.
[1670.66 → 1670.94] Luke.
[1671.14 → 1672.14] Are you ready for insanity?
[1672.86 → 1673.02] Yeah.
[1673.32 → 1677.40] What we really need is NVIDIA to take a more Intel like approach to their product naming.
[1677.40 → 1679.68] I know.
[1679.94 → 1680.48] I'm sorry.
[1680.88 → 1684.30] But Intel actually has this figured out with different suffixes.
[1684.30 → 1685.30] Yeah.
[1685.30 → 1686.30] Like KSQs and whatnot.
[1686.30 → 1686.66] Yeah.
[1686.82 → 1688.86] U is like super ultra low power.
[1689.14 → 1692.84] And F is, uh, has no onboard GPU or whatever.
[1692.84 → 1698.38] And like T is low power, but like desktop, like they, they, they have, I mean, I think
[1698.38 → 1700.62] they've kind of broken some of their naming schemes, but.
[1701.16 → 1705.52] They were trying though with Q and sort of P unofficial P.
[1705.52 → 1705.92] Yeah.
[1706.08 → 1710.42] It's just that they like went and introduced way more SKUs than they had suffixes.
[1710.80 → 1712.62] And now we have this problem.
[1713.34 → 1713.46] Yeah.
[1713.64 → 1719.36] Uh, some people in chat are asking about whether I am still holding, uh, I'm still holding
[1719.36 → 1719.98] GameStop.
[1720.12 → 1720.92] So hold on a second.
[1721.06 → 1721.74] Let me, let me just.
[1721.96 → 1726.34] Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond hands, baby.
[1726.34 → 1731.62] Um, Luke, do you want to talk through our next topic while I, while I, while I demonstrate
[1731.62 → 1732.82] to the people what's going on?
[1732.82 → 1735.28] Should I do the, the, someone that works with Luke's mom thing?
[1735.62 → 1736.64] Yeah, sure.
[1737.24 → 1738.94] So I got a, I got a phone call.
[1739.24 → 1739.64] No, wait, wait.
[1739.70 → 1742.24] I have to, I have to make money first to make up for this.
[1742.34 → 1744.98] Uh, let's, let's get our, let's get our sponsors.
[1745.22 → 1746.30] Let's get our sponsors going.
[1746.74 → 1753.42] Oh, the show is brought to you today by Redux.
[1753.42 → 1757.78] Redux is a PC builder that's striving to bring PC gaming to the masses.
[1758.06 → 1758.50] That's right.
[1758.58 → 1759.60] Not the volumes.
[1760.12 → 1760.56] Okay.
[1760.76 → 1761.86] Not the weights.
[1762.26 → 1764.90] It's all about the masses, not the acceleration.
[1766.14 → 1770.02] They have no price markup on the parts, just a $75 build fee.
[1770.16 → 1773.16] So you just select your budget, pick the games you want to run.
[1773.36 → 1778.06] You can actually see how they perform in their builder and then let them build your PC with
[1778.06 → 1778.70] no hassle.
[1779.20 → 1782.94] Their PC builder allows you to customize what's going on inside based on the games you want
[1782.94 → 1783.12] to play.
[1783.18 → 1785.60] That's kind of a redundant talking point, but I think you guys get the point.
[1785.94 → 1790.14] Plus Redux gets you a two-year warranty for parts and labour through them.
[1790.48 → 1793.64] So start your build today at buildredux.com slash Linus.
[1793.78 → 1796.84] It's not in the talking points, but I refuse to let this go away.
[1796.94 → 1797.92] You guys should know this.
[1798.44 → 1802.24] Um, digital storm, excuse me.
[1802.60 → 1806.90] Uh, so the, uh, Redux, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't know if they have any affiliation with
[1806.90 → 1808.94] any like really well-known PC builder.
[1809.12 → 1811.56] Digital storm, digital storm, excuse me.
[1811.62 → 1811.78] Sorry.
[1811.88 → 1812.70] I had something that caught in my throat.
[1812.78 → 1816.68] Let me just, uh, uh, LTT store.com.
[1816.78 → 1819.64] I was going to say, let me just drink out of my LTT store.com.
[1819.64 → 1820.66] My branded water bottle.
[1820.94 → 1822.14] Uh, so build redux.
[1822.32 → 1824.58] They got a good, good pedigree.
[1824.72 → 1825.00] Okay.
[1825.00 → 1825.96] They know what they're doing.
[1826.44 → 1828.04] Buildredux.com slash Linus.
[1828.40 → 1830.62] The show is also brought to you by Ridge Wallet.
[1830.62 → 1835.26] Stop carrying pointless items around in your pockets, like receipts, sold hotel room keys,
[1835.34 → 1836.28] or spent gift cards.
[1836.80 → 1838.50] Ridge Wallet, hotel room keys.
[1838.58 → 1839.16] Remember hotels?
[1839.66 → 1841.20] Ridge Wallet helps you carry less.
[1841.58 → 1845.40] They use two metal plates that are bound together by a strong elastic band to keep your cards
[1845.40 → 1847.42] tightly together, but still accessible.
[1847.88 → 1848.84] They're RFID blocking.
[1849.00 → 1852.50] They've got a lifetime guarantee, and they're available in aluminum, carbon fibre, and titanium.
[1853.64 → 1855.24] Ridge Wallet has more than just wallets too.
[1855.24 → 1858.08] They've got battery banks, bags, smartphone covers, and more.
[1858.08 → 1861.84] And you can use offer code Linus to save 10% on everything.
[1862.26 → 1862.44] Oh, wait.
[1862.78 → 1863.44] This is the wrong one.
[1864.02 → 1864.48] There we go.
[1864.78 → 1868.48] 10% on everything at ridge.com slash Linus.
[1868.84 → 1870.30] Hey, you got that sorted out.
[1870.74 → 1871.02] Luke.
[1871.92 → 1872.40] Yes.
[1872.64 → 1873.46] Tell us this story.
[1873.54 → 1874.48] Tell me a story, Luke.
[1875.22 → 1876.50] So my mom calls me.
[1877.26 → 1878.76] Was this last night?
[1880.54 → 1883.94] I think this was, I think this was either last night or Wednesday night.
[1883.94 → 1888.58] Um, and she sounds very distraught on the phone.
[1888.98 → 1890.90] She sounded very concerned.
[1891.44 → 1896.48] It sounded like she had maybe done something or something had happened.
[1896.48 → 1898.06] And she was, she was worried about me.
[1898.06 → 1901.40] Like, you know, that, like that tone that sometimes mothers get.
[1901.50 → 1901.76] Yep.
[1902.00 → 1905.40] Um, so I knew something was wrong, and I was asking her what was wrong.
[1905.40 → 1915.10] And apparently her and a lady at her work got in a little, a little bit of a, I believe, purely verbal altercation.
[1915.82 → 1920.88] Um, and I guess my mom being a proud mom has talked about me a bunch at work.
[1920.88 → 1928.80] Um, so this, this other lady said more or less, and I'm, I, I cannot possibly quote here.
[1929.00 → 1935.50] So these are not the words that were said, but meaning as I, I, I'm hopefully going to get the meaning across.
[1935.94 → 1938.70] Um, my sons are good at computers too.
[1939.22 → 1943.68] I'm going to get them to like to go on the internet and like to leave mean comments.
[1943.68 → 1956.38] For, for your son to like try to get back at my mom, which to me felt like they were having like a classic elementary schoolyard battle.
[1956.48 → 1958.24] My dad could beat up your dad.
[1958.50 → 1958.96] Yes.
[1961.70 → 1970.66] So what I have to say to the, the alleged sons that are sicked at me is that hopefully you're enjoying the WAN show.
[1970.66 → 1974.10] Uh, if you do leave a bad comment, I'm probably not going to see it anyway.
[1974.52 → 1978.78] Um, and I'm sorry about your crazy mom, but hopefully you have a good weekend and you enjoy the WAN show.
[1978.94 → 1979.08] Yeah.
[1979.14 → 1980.84] You have a, you have, you have a good one.
[1980.92 → 1981.70] You have a good one, buddy.
[1982.98 → 1984.10] Hopefully he's going well for you.
[1984.40 → 1985.86] That is so brutal.
[1986.60 → 1992.42] Like, I just, she was so concerned about like these internet comments.
[1992.42 → 1996.46] I'm like, man, I've been on the internet as a public figure for like 10 years now.
[1996.58 → 1997.38] I don't care.
[1997.72 → 1998.32] I just like.
[1998.32 → 2000.74] I think pretty much everything's been said.
[2000.88 → 2001.30] Okay.
[2001.34 → 2010.20] I don't think there's anything that could be said to you at this point, Luke, that you've never heard either from a comment on the internet or from me during an annual performance review.
[2010.58 → 2011.24] All right.
[2011.82 → 2022.96] So I was going to say, especially, I feel like especially early on when we first started, you were quite, and I feel like it was more important back then because I feel like the internet was like more vicious and brutal back then.
[2022.96 → 2027.32] But you used to kind of like help toughen people's skins a little bit.
[2027.48 → 2027.98] I did.
[2028.28 → 2029.60] Get them, get them ready.
[2029.76 → 2037.34] And I, yeah, I didn't, there's not, there's, you're not gonna, you're not going to bother me too much on the internet anymore.
[2037.52 → 2038.70] Largely because of that.
[2038.70 → 2044.38] Our community was markedly more brutal actually in the early days.
[2044.38 → 2044.58] Oh yeah.
[2044.58 → 2055.38] Like we're at the point now where like you go back and look at like early comments on an LTT or like an NCI tech tips video from eight, nine, 10, 11 years ago.
[2055.38 → 2058.40] Especially the earlier ones, actually.
[2058.50 → 2059.26] Let's go back.
[2059.94 → 2060.52] Oh man.
[2060.58 → 2061.82] How long have I been doing this?
[2063.42 → 2064.58] Holy crap.
[2064.60 → 2065.06] Long time.
[2065.90 → 2068.50] Go back like 11, 12 years ago.
[2068.68 → 2071.80] You know, the, the comment section is just full of like, oh, look at this guy.
[2071.90 → 2073.12] What an f*** or whatever.
[2073.24 → 2073.42] Right?
[2073.46 → 2076.06] Like it's, it's just every other.
[2076.06 → 2076.84] It worked for that one.
[2077.50 → 2078.02] Yeah, exactly.
[2078.56 → 2081.30] Those comments especially used to be very common.
[2081.48 → 2081.72] Yeah.
[2081.72 → 2086.42] And it's like, Hey, I don't even find that particular word insulting because.
[2086.60 → 2086.70] No.
[2087.66 → 2088.56] It was just very common.
[2088.70 → 2088.82] Yeah.
[2088.84 → 2089.96] What even does it mean?
[2090.04 → 2091.38] It's like, okay, yes.
[2091.46 → 2095.10] And, uh, even if I was yes.
[2095.22 → 2096.34] And so what?
[2096.72 → 2098.14] So, so there's that.
[2098.42 → 2104.38] Um, but there's also just like, just how, how relentless the attacks were back then.
[2104.58 → 2111.10] Nowadays, I feel like we've fostered an environment where it's people just kind of know.
[2111.10 → 2115.24] They know a don't bother because they don't care at all.
[2115.60 → 2118.76] And B, um, you know, that's not cool.
[2119.18 → 2119.44] Right.
[2119.98 → 2120.38] Like it's.
[2120.50 → 2125.12] I feel like there's also another interesting internet thing that I think has evolved is
[2125.12 → 2126.68] there are a lot of defenders now.
[2126.94 → 2127.78] That's true.
[2127.88 → 2128.54] White nights.
[2128.94 → 2131.18] Um, and I don't even mean that in a negative sense.
[2131.40 → 2132.82] I don't even mean that in a negative sense.
[2133.50 → 2134.38] White nights are everywhere.
[2136.00 → 2136.52] Yeah.
[2136.52 → 2138.76] And like pretty intense ones.
[2138.86 → 2144.36] There's, there's, I have seen comments a fair amount of times when I'll, it'll happen
[2144.36 → 2145.10] on Twitter too.
[2145.18 → 2149.38] Someone will like tweet something at me, and I'm like, okay, I can't really respond to
[2149.38 → 2153.86] this because like, it's about me or something.
[2153.86 → 2158.86] And if I defend myself on this, it's just going to be stupid no matter what.
[2158.86 → 2160.96] And I can't just tell this person they're dumb.
[2160.96 → 2163.88] Um, so like, I can't really do anything.
[2163.88 → 2167.18] And then someone like responds to the tweet and just tears them apart.
[2167.32 → 2171.30] And I'm like, ah, yes, I didn't even have to do anything.
[2171.38 → 2171.84] That was great.
[2171.96 → 2175.22] And I can't respond to that person or like their tweet and say, thank you.
[2175.28 → 2176.12] I can't do anything.
[2176.64 → 2180.74] But like, I just silently appreciate it.
[2180.82 → 2183.78] And that's like, that's become, I feel like very common.
[2184.24 → 2187.34] Um, just a quick heads up guys.
[2187.46 → 2189.60] There's some people who seem very confused.
[2189.60 → 2191.90] The word I used was a single syllable.
[2192.16 → 2194.50] So it sure as heck didn't start with an N.
[2194.84 → 2197.98] Let's be, let's be real A plus clear about that.
[2198.00 → 2198.26] Okay.
[2198.34 → 2198.84] Thank you.
[2199.54 → 2203.72] Uh, I have no room for that particular word in my life.
[2203.82 → 2204.90] Never mind my vocabulary.
[2205.80 → 2206.92] Um, all right.
[2206.96 → 2210.22] So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.
[2210.66 → 2211.18] Rumour.
[2211.86 → 2217.50] Apple's VR headset could cost three grand and have 8K displays.
[2217.50 → 2221.18] RC mail hosted, uh, posted, posted this on the forum.
[2221.72 → 2223.84] And let's run you through the details here.
[2224.00 → 2226.90] Could feature two 8K displays and have a price tag of.
[2227.66 → 2228.10] Yeah.
[2228.18 → 2228.90] Three grand, man.
[2229.26 → 2232.62] I mean, well, with that said, it's not like valve didn't release the index.
[2232.62 → 2234.88] And like, that's doing great.
[2234.88 → 2236.10] Apparently at $1,200.
[2236.64 → 2238.68] So if people buy it, no question.
[2238.80 → 2238.92] Yeah.
[2239.02 → 2240.20] No, no, no question.
[2240.38 → 2241.50] No question whatsoever.
[2242.14 → 2243.86] Um, the headset.
[2243.94 → 2248.40] At least one model is expected to have 12 cameras for AR and hand tracking.
[2248.62 → 2251.60] That's, that's, that's crazy.
[2251.60 → 2256.92] Uh, the headset will also have a lidar sensor to quickly generate a 3d map of your room,
[2256.98 → 2260.76] which is actually, um, creepy, but super cool at the same time.
[2261.42 → 2263.26] Um, hopefully that's all local.
[2263.48 → 2268.84] Apple is still testing various input methods, including things worn on your fingers, reading
[2268.84 → 2271.80] body movement and a knob in the headset.
[2272.04 → 2274.88] Don't know what that's about, but yeah.
[2274.88 → 2276.62] I mean, that would be super cool.
[2276.92 → 2281.96] We've said countless times on the WAN show that Apple is very happy.
[2282.16 → 2283.20] You know, exactly where I'm going.
[2283.50 → 2289.96] Apple is very happy to, to watch a bunch of people break into a new segment and trudge
[2289.96 → 2292.96] through the beginning of it and then come in and be like, here you go.
[2293.26 → 2294.68] Here's the ready for market one.
[2295.22 → 2300.24] Um, so yeah, I w I would love to see this come out, and I would love to see it do really
[2300.24 → 2300.50] well.
[2300.50 → 2302.94] That would be very good for VR as a whole.
[2302.94 → 2310.98] Um, like however much you like or dislike Apple, it like doesn't matter because if they bring
[2310.98 → 2313.84] this to market, and it does really well, that will bring other things to market that will
[2313.84 → 2314.62] also do really well.
[2314.70 → 2316.32] This would be very good for VR as a whole.
[2317.04 → 2320.12] I still, I worry about Apple.
[2320.94 → 2322.96] I, I, I, I don't worry about Apple.
[2322.96 → 2323.42] Apple's fine.
[2323.60 → 2328.06] I just mean, I worry that Apple's approach will not win me over.
[2328.06 → 2332.36] I mean, they just, they've shown time and time again, a disdain for gamers.
[2332.94 → 2334.38] If they popularize it.
[2334.80 → 2335.28] Yeah.
[2336.28 → 2338.40] There's, there's like, we, we see this all the time.
[2338.40 → 2342.74] Like some, some, a few random companies will make some Jacky things, and we're like, these
[2342.74 → 2344.00] are cool, but they're not there yet.
[2344.00 → 2347.08] And then Apple will make it, and it'll be there now.
[2347.16 → 2351.14] And everyone will clone it, and it'll be better in a lot of ways, but it could actually be
[2351.14 → 2353.70] worse in a lot of ways.
[2353.70 → 2358.46] You know, like the whole notch trend thing that I really wish never happened.
[2358.80 → 2359.28] Fair.
[2359.56 → 2360.32] Yeah, that's true.
[2361.56 → 2362.02] Yeah.
[2362.60 → 2362.80] Yeah.
[2362.80 → 2363.10] I don't know.
[2363.46 → 2369.10] I still think it's, I'm still rooting for good because I think a lot of what VR needs
[2369.10 → 2371.28] right now is just more market adoption.
[2371.56 → 2371.80] Sure.
[2371.98 → 2372.40] That's fair.
[2372.60 → 2376.56] It just needs more people to start using it more and more and more and more people just
[2376.56 → 2377.48] need to start using it.
[2377.48 → 2384.18] Um, and we'll get better solutions because like even the index and see, this is why,
[2384.30 → 2386.42] this is why all the VR Subreddits and stuff hate me.
[2386.50 → 2389.86] Even the index as fantastic as it is, is pretty rough.
[2390.12 → 2390.60] Yeah.
[2390.60 → 2391.18] It's not perfect.
[2391.30 → 2394.16] Uh, Oculus's lenses are so much better than valves.
[2394.42 → 2395.94] Um, it's heavy.
[2396.30 → 2397.50] The speakers are great.
[2397.70 → 2399.06] Those speakers are like.
[2399.42 → 2400.60] The speakers are fantastic.
[2400.74 → 2401.74] The mic is like.
[2402.60 → 2402.96] Unbelievable.
[2403.32 → 2404.18] Perfect.
[2404.28 → 2405.14] It's unbelievable.
[2405.66 → 2406.88] That blew my mind.
[2406.88 → 2408.32] Absolutely blew my mind.
[2408.46 → 2408.56] Yeah.
[2408.70 → 2412.52] Um, there's, there are some things that are perfect about it, but you still need to
[2412.52 → 2415.16] like drill a bunch of stuff into your walls.
[2415.28 → 2415.58] Yeah.
[2415.94 → 2420.06] And it's like steam VR updates can be really clunky.
[2420.52 → 2423.52] And you know, when you decide, okay, I'm going to play VR.
[2424.00 → 2426.56] You don't just throw on your headset and go.
[2427.20 → 2429.64] You have to, I have to, because mine's on, mine's on my TV.
[2429.64 → 2434.36] So I have to go get my like remote control, like headset or handset thing.
[2434.42 → 2436.52] I have to like log into windows.
[2436.52 → 2438.00] I have to open up steam.
[2438.14 → 2438.26] Okay.
[2438.26 → 2441.70] Technically you can just turn on the controller, and it'll, it'll fire up.
[2442.16 → 2443.06] Uh, but it.
[2443.94 → 2447.52] It's like, sometimes it doesn't work properly, or I'll get into beat safer.
[2448.06 → 2450.00] People start up on their computer first.
[2450.00 → 2454.30] And like one of my Sayers is stuck on the floor, even though it works when I like to go into the
[2454.30 → 2455.86] menu, it's tracking just fine.
[2455.86 → 2457.62] But then the game doesn't have it.
[2457.62 → 2461.02] And I have to, I have to restart the entire steam VR thing in order to get it working.
[2461.02 → 2465.38] Like these, these early adopter growing pains are like, they're still there.
[2465.38 → 2466.40] It's been three years.
[2466.40 → 2467.12] Yeah.
[2467.12 → 2468.20] Four years or whatever.
[2468.20 → 2469.22] It's been a great experience.
[2469.22 → 2474.12] And, and that's awesome and whatnot, but like, it's just, it's not a hundred percent there.
[2474.12 → 2477.38] You still have to map your room out by walking around it with a controller.
[2477.38 → 2482.68] So you have all these like hard edges, and it can't deal with, um, oddly shaped rooms very
[2482.68 → 2482.96] well.
[2482.96 → 2484.60] It has issues with reflections.
[2484.60 → 2489.64] There's like all this stuff that like, yeah, we do need to eventually get over.
[2490.16 → 2496.86] Um, and it's great right now, but yeah, there's, there's so much better in the future.
[2497.08 → 2498.54] There will be so much better.
[2498.66 → 2501.18] Uh, people are asking about the update on my holdings.
[2501.18 → 2505.00] So I didn't end up going all in 50 K on GameStop.
[2505.00 → 2509.94] I bought $30,000 of GameStop and then $10,000 of AMC.
[2510.36 → 2514.14] So, which is another meme stock and then 10 of BCRX, which.
[2514.60 → 2518.30] I actually bought because I thought it was a meme stock, but actually it was one that
[2518.30 → 2519.74] was reasonably well-researched.
[2520.08 → 2524.48] So, so far then, um, the biggest loss has been GameStop.
[2524.84 → 2529.74] Um, I would show this to you guys, but I think I can't actually focus on it anyway.
[2529.74 → 2532.14] And it's kind of hard to look at.
[2532.14 → 2536.84] Also, the market value is not working correctly on my app for whatever reason.
[2537.02 → 2537.28] I don't know.
[2537.32 → 2538.80] I'm sure someone can fix this.
[2539.16 → 2540.86] So you can see the 30,000 is there.
[2540.98 → 2542.08] So I'm diamond hands holding.
[2542.08 → 2544.96] I told you guys that I'm going to ride it into the ground.
[2545.40 → 2551.18] So, um, you know, for me, it was not about thinking that I was going to be getting rich
[2551.18 → 2552.60] quick or anything like that.
[2552.70 → 2554.70] Frankly, I didn't need to gamble the money.
[2554.98 → 2557.88] Um, you know, I actually have a job where I make perfect money.
[2557.88 → 2563.30] So I, I didn't need like a like an investment lottery ticket effectively.
[2563.60 → 2568.02] For me, this was more about the movement that was happening, being on the right side of
[2568.02 → 2572.18] history at this time, I really do believe wealth inequality is the biggest problem facing
[2572.18 → 2574.18] us as a society right now.
[2574.64 → 2578.34] Um, so, you know, for me, there was only, there were only good outcomes.
[2578.60 → 2579.24] Good outcome.
[2579.30 → 2582.98] Number one was, Hey, it turns out their right to the moon.
[2583.48 → 2584.16] Okay, cool.
[2584.56 → 2586.58] And we could have found something cool to do with the money.
[2586.64 → 2589.96] Maybe we, maybe we donated or something, but you know, we'd figure something out.
[2589.96 → 2594.42] Maybe we host like a really cool event, um, that we don't even try to make a profit on,
[2594.42 → 2595.56] but people can come and participate.
[2595.68 → 2596.78] I don't know what it would be.
[2596.84 → 2597.94] We'd, we'd find something to do.
[2598.32 → 2599.66] Um, or good outcome.
[2599.72 → 2602.34] Number two was some wealth got redistributed.
[2604.32 → 2605.12] There you go.
[2605.96 → 2612.88] Um, so I, I saw it as kind of like a donation to people who were investing in this thing cause
[2612.88 → 2613.84] they really needed it.
[2614.20 → 2615.10] Uh, and you know what?
[2615.14 → 2616.84] Maybe it ended up going to the hedge funds anyway.
[2616.96 → 2617.44] I don't know.
[2617.50 → 2621.20] But one way or another, I, I, I felt, I don't know.
[2621.28 → 2622.00] I felt compelled.
[2622.00 → 2623.70] I felt like I needed to participate.
[2623.70 → 2624.82] I enjoyed the memes.
[2625.96 → 2631.68] Um, homie KP over in float plane chat says, Hey, I saw the GPD video is the new one worth
[2631.68 → 2635.52] the weight or should I go with the max really want to emulate PS one and a few Game Cube games,
[2635.60 → 2635.74] man.
[2636.92 → 2639.04] It's the new one is like sick.
[2639.76 → 2641.72] Um, wait, the saw the GPD video.
[2641.80 → 2645.50] You mean the like most recent one that I thought that was the GPD max or the win three.
[2645.58 → 2646.62] I don't remember whichever one.
[2646.66 → 2648.48] The last one we did is its sick.
[2648.60 → 2649.08] It's sick.
[2649.18 → 2649.94] It's like sick.
[2649.98 → 2650.38] Go for it.
[2650.74 → 2652.38] Uh, people are like wife talk, please.
[2652.38 → 2652.86] Okay.
[2653.40 → 2658.76] So she wasn't thrilled with me doing it without talking to her.
[2659.36 → 2666.96] But the reality of it is that, um, you know, once we talked about what I was doing and that
[2666.96 → 2671.78] I, I wasn't just like going crazy and buying into some get rich quick scheme.
[2671.78 → 2675.50] Um, she facilitated getting the account all set up.
[2675.58 → 2676.52] She got me the credentials.
[2677.28 → 2681.62] She, uh, helped me through the whole process because transferring money from one bank to
[2681.62 → 2683.54] another is not always something you can do electronically.
[2683.54 → 2684.58] So she's like, yeah, okay.
[2684.88 → 2688.70] She made, she watched the kids for me while I went and got the checks from the office and
[2688.70 → 2692.54] went to the bank and deposited it and like helped me get it all going.
[2692.54 → 2694.32] She, she put time aside to help with it.
[2694.32 → 2696.04] Cause like, we're, we're good.
[2696.10 → 2701.06] Like I, I, we joke a lot about, you know, Oh, you know, what has he done now?
[2701.42 → 2702.76] You know, she might be mad.
[2702.84 → 2703.54] Ha ha ha ha.
[2703.98 → 2707.96] I really liked the sleeping on the couch tweet that you made.
[2708.06 → 2708.26] Yeah.
[2708.30 → 2708.48] Yeah.
[2708.58 → 2710.16] I was obviously joking.
[2710.16 → 2715.74] I have never slept on the couch in my entire 15-year relationship with that lady.
[2716.00 → 2719.10] And neither has she, we have a hard and fast rule.
[2719.10 → 2720.88] You do not go to bed angry.
[2721.52 → 2728.96] We've definitely been up till five in the morning from time to time, but we have always
[2728.96 → 2733.80] slept in the same bed, and we have always stuck to that belief.
[2734.06 → 2740.24] So that's what it is all about when it comes to maintaining a relationship we've found.
[2741.32 → 2743.50] Um, Hey, yeah, McNuggets got it right.
[2743.62 → 2745.46] My luckiest moment in life was meeting Yvonne.
[2745.46 → 2750.14] Not just that, but you know, I, we don't take for granted that we had the we had the
[2750.38 → 2753.86] the, the privilege of meeting each other extremely young, you know?
[2753.86 → 2759.56] So we met each other when we were 19 and not everybody, not everybody finds the one that
[2759.56 → 2760.08] fast.
[2760.24 → 2762.62] You know, neither of us had to waste a lot of time.
[2762.88 → 2764.90] If, if, and I don't mean waste time.
[2764.90 → 2768.56] I mean, sometimes, you know, we look back, and we go, you know, ha, maybe it would have
[2768.56 → 2771.70] been, maybe it would have been fun to, to date for a while.
[2771.70 → 2777.66] And stuff, or, you know, have a more wild and crazy university experience or, or whatever.
[2778.08 → 2779.42] You know, it's certain.
[2779.66 → 2779.80] Yeah.
[2779.80 → 2780.12] Yeah.
[2780.12 → 2781.10] Maybe that would have been fun.
[2781.54 → 2783.08] Uh, it's not really my style.
[2783.14 → 2783.66] Luke's laughing.
[2784.60 → 2785.12] Yes.
[2785.22 → 2785.48] Yes.
[2785.48 → 2788.02] I'm, I'm very, I'm, I'm pretty conservative.
[2788.14 → 2788.32] Yes.
[2788.54 → 2788.58] Luke.
[2790.26 → 2795.90] But the point is the point is, um, sometimes you can't help, but think about those things,
[2795.90 → 2799.90] but I definitely have no regrets whatsoever.
[2801.16 → 2803.22] I'm, I'm, I'm glad it worked out this way.
[2803.50 → 2806.28] Uh, Oh, speaking of being glad things worked out this way.
[2807.60 → 2809.84] Oh, I just put an LTT sore.com.
[2809.90 → 2811.40] I'm afraid of whatever that is.
[2812.58 → 2814.68] Oh, does that, does that exist?
[2815.16 → 2817.48] That's going to exist very soon.
[2817.48 → 2817.94] I'm sure.
[2818.38 → 2819.28] It's available.
[2819.62 → 2821.50] Only 1200 Canadian dollars.
[2821.88 → 2822.94] Oh, okay.
[2823.02 → 2823.46] Yeah.
[2823.58 → 2824.00] Don't.
[2824.00 → 2828.62] That's a stupid thing to, if you're gonna, if you're going to like spend money on that for
[2828.62 → 2831.50] the memes, please don't, please do something useful with that money.
[2831.94 → 2832.94] Like buying ME.
[2833.52 → 2834.68] I was going to say, I'm kidding.
[2834.78 → 2835.10] I'm kidding.
[2835.16 → 2836.22] I'm not a financial advisor.
[2836.22 → 2837.50] I'm just a smooth brain ape.
[2837.66 → 2839.06] I have no idea what I'm doing.
[2839.58 → 2842.50] That's the that's the, the, the boilerplate disclaimer for that.
[2842.52 → 2842.70] Right.
[2842.78 → 2843.06] Okay.
[2843.16 → 2845.26] Don't really, for real, don't do either of those things.
[2845.26 → 2845.48] Okay.
[2845.76 → 2847.12] Don't, don't, don't throw your money away.
[2847.54 → 2848.14] Uh, all right.
[2848.48 → 2851.78] If you want to throw your money away, do it on LTT store.com guys.
[2852.26 → 2853.22] These are sick.
[2854.00 → 2855.20] We finally have them.
[2855.66 → 2856.80] We've got, okay, here.
[2856.86 → 2858.68] How do I, no, not that one.
[2858.90 → 2859.90] Oh, what?
[2859.98 → 2860.52] I just move.
[2860.68 → 2861.66] I think I just moved a thing.
[2862.24 → 2863.34] Where's the one I want to move.
[2863.82 → 2864.94] Where's the thing I want to move.
[2864.98 → 2865.56] Oh, there we go.
[2865.58 → 2865.88] There we go.
[2865.90 → 2866.22] There we go.
[2866.22 → 2866.38] Okay.
[2866.44 → 2866.76] Here we go.
[2866.82 → 2867.14] Here we go.
[2867.20 → 2867.88] Let's make it a little smaller.
[2868.54 → 2871.48] Storage and RAM for those cold days.
[2871.60 → 2872.46] $39.99.
[2873.82 → 2874.42] That's right.
[2874.42 → 2879.68] Ladies and gentlemen, we have LTT store scarves.
[2879.68 → 2882.96] See, look, it's got a little notch for the M.2.
[2883.28 → 2885.32] It's got the NAND chips on there.
[2885.42 → 2886.86] The DRAM cache.
[2887.32 → 2889.38] It's got the see, check it out.
[2889.82 → 2890.02] Sarah.
[2890.10 → 2892.60] Oh, hey, Sarah's modelling the, uh, the M.2 one.
[2893.02 → 2893.88] Look at that.
[2894.42 → 2895.56] Hey, Lloyd's up in there.
[2895.66 → 2896.52] Lloyd designed this one.
[2896.58 → 2897.36] Look, look, see.
[2897.56 → 2899.74] It's good for, it's good for casual.
[2900.42 → 2902.70] I'm probably the most casual looking one here.
[2902.80 → 2905.48] It's good for like, uh, business casual.
[2905.76 → 2907.54] It's good for more business.
[2907.60 → 2908.66] That still looks pretty casual.
[2908.90 → 2910.36] The point is it looks great.
[2910.44 → 2911.42] And the RAM one.
[2911.50 → 2913.18] So we've got orange and dark gray.
[2913.90 → 2914.74] Look at this guy.
[2914.80 → 2915.90] What a majestic specimen.
[2918.18 → 2919.22] Isn't that fantastic?
[2919.36 → 2920.98] I think Lloyd did a fantastic job.
[2921.02 → 2924.94] If you already have one of the takes or beanies, uh, it's a very similar material.
[2924.94 → 2926.26] We're working with the same supplier.
[2926.36 → 2927.92] We've been extremely happy with them.
[2928.20 → 2929.92] You guys are going to want to get in on this.
[2929.92 → 2936.56] I know it's a little late on for winter, but hey, you know, it's always winter
[2936.56 → 2936.96] somewhere.
[2937.04 → 2938.42] It's kind of hitting winter now.
[2938.80 → 2938.96] Yeah.
[2939.20 → 2939.96] There you go.
[2939.98 → 2940.54] Depends on where you're at.
[2941.16 → 2941.60] Exactly.
[2941.76 → 2942.10] Exactly.
[2942.20 → 2943.02] So go check them out.
[2943.26 → 2944.32] LTTstore.com.
[2944.68 → 2945.84] Uh, what else we got?
[2946.08 → 2948.38] Uh, oh man.
[2948.52 → 2952.28] Uh, Valve was fined $4 million in a steam controller patent case.
[2952.72 → 2954.30] Uh, Corsair got them.
[2954.58 → 2959.68] So Iron berg Inventions, the IP holding arm of Scuff, who Corsair recently acquired, made the
[2959.68 → 2963.60] argument that the steam controller contained the same rear side control surfaces that they
[2963.60 → 2964.34] had just patented.
[2965.48 → 2970.00] Interestingly, Microsoft used the same implementation of back paddles on the Xbox wireless elite
[2970.00 → 2974.74] controllers, but they licensed the patent from Corsair for $6 million, which Valve could
[2974.74 → 2977.20] have done because they have enough money to buy the earth and all the heavens.
[2977.32 → 2979.02] They just decided not to.
[2979.02 → 2982.36] So now they've had to pay, I think it's $4 million in damages.
[2982.82 → 2985.70] And that may not be entirely the end of it.
[2985.80 → 2987.76] Don't quote me on that.
[2988.38 → 2993.10] Um, one thing that was fascinating about this was just that there are a lot of patents
[2993.10 → 2997.92] in the game industry from Sega's patent on in-game directions to Nintendo's patent on the
[2997.92 → 3002.92] D-pad, which, which is interesting because it might actually explain why Xbox D-pad sucks
[3002.92 → 3003.30] so bad.
[3003.30 → 3008.40] So if it's a unique feature that can be monetized, you can pretty much bet that game developers
[3008.40 → 3009.90] will try to protect it.
[3010.24 → 3013.30] In this case, I think Scuff was extremely reasonable about it.
[3013.62 → 3017.90] They wrote a letter to Valve explaining their belief that the rear controllers were an infringement.
[3018.46 → 3022.64] And apparently Valve just like went ahead with it anyway.
[3023.42 → 3025.76] Um, so there you go.
[3025.76 → 3032.90] Yeah, there, there was, um, I believe it was a Stratton, Stratton poll, um, uh, patent troll
[3032.90 → 3033.52] situation.
[3033.80 → 3038.98] But a while ago, I remember talking on the WAN show about, uh, there was like, someone had
[3038.98 → 3042.24] patented the idea of having a mini-game during loading screens.
[3042.78 → 3046.32] Cause like console loading screens back in the day, I haven't played much console lately,
[3046.32 → 3048.10] but it might still be not great.
[3048.24 → 3051.10] Uh, but it used to be horrible.
[3051.10 → 3055.66] I remember trying to load Borrowing on the original Xbox was like an ordeal.
[3056.16 → 3060.34] Like one of the worst parts about dying was like the fact that you'd have to load the
[3060.34 → 3060.76] game again.
[3060.76 → 3062.70] Not the fact that you lost your save necessarily.
[3063.14 → 3063.50] Yeah.
[3063.54 → 3064.96] You have to like to launch the game again.
[3065.00 → 3066.04] It would take so long.
[3066.46 → 3071.08] Um, so yeah, the, the, the idea of having like, I don't know, even snake running during
[3071.08 → 3072.90] those loading screens was patented.
[3073.14 → 3076.36] So like, there was like one game that had it and it was really cool.
[3076.38 → 3077.72] And I was like, wow, this would be awesome.
[3077.72 → 3081.66] This would be really great when everyone starts doing this and then just nothing.
[3082.24 → 3083.36] And it, it sucked.
[3083.36 → 3092.66] But I do kind of feel like in gaming, um, patents should probably not be quite as long as they
[3092.66 → 3097.92] are in other industries because it moves so fast.
[3097.92 → 3102.00] I mean, what was the what, what's the patent expiry standard?
[3103.00 → 3105.58] Uh, 20 years.
[3105.76 → 3110.34] So in the United States for utility patents filed on or after June 1995, it's 20 years
[3110.34 → 3111.74] from the earliest filing date.
[3111.88 → 3115.14] So like 20 years, what was happening in gaming in 2000?
[3115.22 → 3116.06] That would have been Xbox.
[3116.40 → 3120.84] That would have been first generation Xbox is how long we would have to wait for something
[3120.84 → 3125.02] like that or something like a better D pad design to start to make its way out into the
[3125.02 → 3125.68] general market.
[3127.28 → 3128.04] That's pretty rough.
[3128.04 → 3132.92] And that assumes that they don't manage to extend the, uh, or renew the patent in any
[3132.92 → 3133.58] meaningful way.
[3133.58 → 3137.86] And like, I'm all for having the opportunity to make money based on your innovations.
[3137.86 → 3139.50] That absolutely matters.
[3140.28 → 3149.74] But especially if it's being utilized in a way that has no appreciable impact on your business
[3149.74 → 3150.22] whatsoever.
[3150.22 → 3152.02] It's, it's pretty, it's pretty rough.
[3152.08 → 3155.76] I mean, I would make the argument at this point that the Xbox does not really compete
[3155.76 → 3159.02] with the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft and Nintendo.
[3159.90 → 3164.30] Can you think of a way that they really go toe to toe anywhere?
[3165.76 → 3169.44] I mean, yeah, not really.
[3169.86 → 3176.22] I can't think of that many people that are like, oh man, I don't know which one I'm going
[3176.22 → 3181.26] to get a switch or an Xbox is either, am I going to buy a switch or not?
[3181.80 → 3184.44] Or am I going to buy an Xbox or a PlayStation?
[3185.12 → 3185.34] Yeah.
[3185.40 → 3189.94] Like in a sense, they're both competing for some chunk of your disposable income.
[3190.24 → 3190.68] Yeah.
[3190.98 → 3194.82] But to me, they are, they're, they're not two sides of the same coin.
[3194.90 → 3196.58] They're completely different wallets.
[3196.58 → 3198.98] Like it's different, different currencies.
[3198.98 → 3204.40] So it just feels like there's got to be a better way to do it.
[3204.48 → 3209.28] Unfortunately, I'm just one of those people who is finding a problem, not one of those
[3209.28 → 3211.46] ones who's suggesting a real viable solution.
[3211.88 → 3219.06] In our final news item for the day, NZXT has apologized for the safety issue around their
[3219.06 → 3220.22] H1 case.
[3220.72 → 3225.90] The H1 will be removed from the NZXT store after Gamers Nexus proved that the nylon screw
[3225.90 → 3226.24] fixed.
[3226.24 → 3230.88] So basically they had a PCI Express riser in there that didn't have a big enough keep
[3230.88 → 3232.72] out zone around where it screwed in.
[3232.94 → 3237.98] So the screw could actually accidentally, if it is like scratched the surface of the PCB,
[3238.14 → 3242.98] like the epoxy that's on there or resin or whatever it is, if it scratched it, it would
[3242.98 → 3245.06] actually contact the copper underneath.
[3245.20 → 3248.90] And that was a 12 volt portion of the PCB.
[3249.18 → 3251.72] So it would just short and could potentially start a fire.
[3251.72 → 3255.78] Now they fixed it with a nylon screw instead of a metal screw.
[3256.00 → 3260.76] But Steve from Gamers Nexus made the I think, compelling point that the nylon screw is only
[3260.76 → 3265.16] a fix as long as the user keeps that nylon screw forever.
[3265.16 → 3273.64] So if they didn't, if the, if the original owner resold that case, for example, a new owner might not realize how important that is or might look at the nylon screw and go,
[3273.64 → 3274.94] oh, that's a crappy nylon screw.
[3274.94 → 3283.02] I'm going to do, I'm going to get a better metal one, which could allow it to short, turning to heat and then, well, potentially causing a fire.
[3283.02 → 3293.92] So anyone who previously requested a nylon screw kit will be sent the new fix, which is an updated riser assembly that should resolve the issue of exposed traces on the PCB once and for all.
[3294.46 → 3299.90] Steve from Gamers Nexus is still critical of how long it took NZXT to properly solve this problem.
[3299.90 → 3306.32] But it seems like this new solution should be the last one that is required.
[3307.08 → 3308.88] I am happy that they actually resolved it.
[3309.04 → 3309.52] That's cool.
[3309.72 → 3310.34] Yeah, me too.
[3310.34 → 3310.86] I'll give them props.
[3311.38 → 3311.94] Yeah, me too.
[3311.94 → 3315.34] Because like for me, it's, it's, it's rough.
[3315.40 → 3325.94] Like it puts me in a bad position where like we've worked with NZXT and the last thing we want is a bunch of like sponsor spots, not just moving forward, but even like past ones, promoting a company that is not taking care of its users.
[3325.94 → 3327.54] That's not something that we stand for.
[3329.40 → 3334.68] And so, you know, for us, we, we need, we, well, it's just, yeah, it's that simple.
[3334.78 → 3338.54] We need our advertising partners to do the right thing in these cases.
[3338.88 → 3339.02] Yeah.
[3339.36 → 3339.54] Yeah.
[3340.54 → 3341.20] All right.
[3341.20 → 3342.52] That's pretty much it.
[3342.52 → 3346.02] Other than going through some super chats.
[3346.28 → 3348.22] Austin asks, when are new beanie colours coming?
[3348.44 → 3350.34] Need more to tame the COVID hair?
[3350.62 → 3351.50] Ah, you know what?
[3351.52 → 3353.50] I don't know if we have any other colours planned at the moment.
[3353.58 → 3355.04] I mean, it's a matter of time.
[3355.10 → 3357.76] At some point we'll, we'll probably do it, but I don't know right now.
[3358.16 → 3361.34] Lucky says, we have motherboards and CPUs that are interchangeable.
[3361.56 → 3365.14] Why not graphics cardboards with various memory slash connector configuration?
[3365.14 → 3367.34] So it's been done way back in the day.
[3367.40 → 3371.50] The truth is that it's just not worth changing in most cases.
[3371.50 → 3375.32] It would add so much more cost and complexity to the design of the board.
[3375.32 → 3382.76] And in most cases, a GPU was designed specifically around the memory technology that it's going to go with.
[3382.76 → 3397.14] And the industry moves fast enough that by the time you're ready to upgrade that to some new memory technology, that new memory technology is going to be faster or higher density than that GPU could really take advantage of anyway.
[3397.14 → 3399.74] So you might as well just upgrade the whole board at the same time.
[3401.00 → 3403.98] Joe asks, what is the best way to support you both?
[3404.10 → 3404.90] I love the content.
[3405.02 → 3406.80] Used to be a float plane OG, but missed a payment.
[3407.50 → 3410.12] Float plane is definitely the best way to support us both.
[3410.58 → 3414.80] You should also still be a float plane OG if you resubscribe.
[3416.34 → 3420.24] I mean, yeah, it definitely wouldn't fall with one payment.
[3420.74 → 3426.78] There might be a system that eventually takes it away if you don't pay for like a really long time.
[3426.78 → 3429.60] But like, yeah, if you miss one payment, you're not you're not out of the game.
[3430.50 → 3435.30] So, yeah, if it stays an issue, just contact support.
[3436.38 → 3443.06] Gabriel Gray says bought at 16 for GameStop, covered at 38, the rest at 372.
[3443.24 → 3446.22] If I'd held I'd have had 150K after taxes and fees.
[3446.42 → 3448.82] Dang, still ended up with 90.
[3448.94 → 3453.30] So, hey, there were some people out there who really did make out like bandits on that whole thing.
[3453.30 → 3454.18] Mm hmm.
[3457.08 → 3460.86] A&W says you were talking about the process and time of developing commercial property.
[3460.94 → 3464.48] What are the odds that LMG float plane hires enough staff that you need to move to a larger space?
[3464.52 → 3465.76] And would you want to build it, man?
[3466.12 → 3468.30] I wouldn't want to build anything.
[3468.80 → 3475.70] One of the problems that we have as a utterly unique sort of new wave company,
[3475.70 → 3479.54] like new media is that there's nothing really designed for us.
[3480.16 → 3484.94] So it's definitely something the reason I know all those timelines is that it is something that I've looked into.
[3484.94 → 3487.74] And we are starting to feel the squeeze of our current space.
[3487.74 → 3492.16] That's why we have five units now instead of three, which is what we started with.
[3492.54 → 3498.18] But I that's not something that I would promise or commit to in any way.
[3498.32 → 3500.64] It would be an incredible amount of work.
[3500.64 → 3505.22] Oh, hey, thanks, Admiral Brocade.
[3506.48 → 3512.90] And oh, Adair says, have you tried any of the new synthetic badminton shuttles that are not classic nylon?
[3513.08 → 3516.04] I've seen a lot of articles about it, but availability seems to be worse than GPUs.
[3516.06 → 3517.96] Yeah, I'm super excited to try it.
[3518.04 → 3518.92] I have not tried it.
[3518.96 → 3520.90] I've only used feather and nylon so far.
[3521.40 → 3523.66] I would love to try the synthetic feather ones.
[3524.26 → 3526.16] So that's it for the WAN show, you guys.
[3526.30 → 3527.76] Thank you very much for tuning in.
[3527.82 → 3528.42] Oh, that's great.
[3528.52 → 3529.22] Righteous Weevil.
[3529.22 → 3531.18] What a great comment to squeak in at the end.
[3531.64 → 3535.48] I'm graduating with my computer information systems degree this semester and your content
[3535.48 → 3537.02] was super helpful and entertaining.
[3537.54 → 3538.56] Heck yeah.
[3539.08 → 3543.24] JM asks, Linus, where would you invest if you had just 50,000 US dollars?
[3543.66 → 3549.92] I would invest in my business, Linus Media Group or one of my other businesses like Creator
[3549.92 → 3552.62] Warehouse Inc or Float plane Media Inc.
[3552.62 → 3560.04] Those are the best businesses for me to invest in because any business, whether it's a private
[3560.04 → 3564.48] firm and you're doing like a private investment thing or whether it's a public firm, any business
[3564.48 → 3569.96] you invest in is subject to currents that are outside your control.
[3569.96 → 3579.86] And even your own business is going to be buffeted by winds that you didn't see coming, and you had no way of knowing about or controlling.
[3580.00 → 3581.14] And all you can do is react to them.
[3581.22 → 3582.14] But that's the difference.
[3582.42 → 3588.28] When you invest in your own business, you're the one at the wheel.
[3588.64 → 3589.72] You can steer the ship.
[3589.72 → 3594.62] And that's something that as an entrepreneur, I believe in very strongly.
[3595.00 → 3607.50] Up until my ME investment, the only investments that I had ever made in the past where I dabbled with OCT and NVIDIA back like a thousand years ago.
[3607.88 → 3608.86] Yeah, true story.
[3608.92 → 3610.06] I bought NVIDIA at $18.
[3611.26 → 3614.94] If I had just instead of pulling it out and then leaving it.
[3614.94 → 3615.80] You had diamond-held NVIDIA?
[3616.20 → 3618.24] If I had diamond-held NVIDIA, I'd be in great shape.
[3618.24 → 3620.10] It would also be an enormous conflict of interest.
[3620.24 → 3621.44] So I couldn't have done it.
[3621.58 → 3624.90] But that doesn't mean you don't look back and go, oh, gee, what if?
[3625.74 → 3629.02] So way back in the day, I don't know, almost 15 years ago.
[3630.20 → 3635.04] And then I bought some crypto back in 2018.
[3635.04 → 3636.54] That didn't work out great for me.
[3637.82 → 3643.66] And the thing is, I went 10 years without investing because I basically see it in a lot of ways as gambling.
[3644.04 → 3648.14] There are ways to do a lot of due diligence, but there also is an element of gambling involved.
[3648.14 → 3649.68] And that's not something that I...
[3649.68 → 3652.44] I've always been a one-in-the-hand versus two-in-the-bush kind of guy.
[3653.38 → 3655.98] And then I didn't stay true to that.
[3656.34 → 3657.20] And then I regretted it.
[3657.20 → 3659.12] And I was like, okay, yeah, now I know this.
[3659.32 → 3660.08] I'm just...
[3660.08 → 3660.98] I come in too late.
[3661.16 → 3662.06] I get out too late.
[3662.20 → 3663.32] That's what I know about me.
[3664.36 → 3666.86] Or I get out too early sometimes, you know, with the NVIDIA thing.
[3667.26 → 3673.98] And then the last investment that I've ever made in my life was the meme stuff that I just talked to you guys about.
[3674.08 → 3675.98] And that was only because I told you guys I'd do it.
[3676.14 → 3678.24] Not because I expected to make any kind of money.
[3678.46 → 3678.52] So it's...
[3678.52 → 3680.40] Yeah, that wasn't really...
[3680.40 → 3685.20] That wasn't like a financial forecast profit decision.
[3685.50 → 3686.40] Yeah, that was not...
[3686.40 → 3688.22] That was not about making money, for sure.
[3688.22 → 3688.40] Yeah.
[3689.48 → 3689.88] Yeah.
[3691.12 → 3691.66] All right.
[3691.70 → 3692.26] So that's it.
[3692.38 → 3694.42] Thanks, you guys, very much for tuning in.
[3694.66 → 3695.78] We'll see you again next week.
[3695.88 → 3697.18] Same bad time.
[3697.32 → 3698.18] Same bad channel.
[3698.32 → 3701.42] And yeah, Alexander FL comments, I forgot I had float plane.
[3701.52 → 3702.34] Quality much better here.
[3702.42 → 3702.60] Wow.
[3702.82 → 3704.10] Heck freaking yeah.
[3704.48 → 3706.00] You guys got to get float plane, yo.
[3706.94 → 3707.24] Yeah.
[3713.92 → 3714.28] Bye.
[3716.46 → 3717.76] You didn't run the intro, by the way.
[3717.76 → 3718.70] I'm running it now.
[3719.90 → 3721.18] I run it after you say bye.
[3721.68 → 3723.02] No, at the beginning of the show.
[3723.16 → 3723.80] I totally forgot.
[3723.90 → 3724.62] We just went right into it.
[3725.14 → 3725.62] Whoops-dates.
[3739.06 → 3739.78] YouTube down.
