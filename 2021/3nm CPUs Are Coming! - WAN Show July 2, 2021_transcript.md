[0.04 --> 3.12]  Well, you don't have to sit up. You could also just tilt your camera down a little bit.
[3.62 --> 6.06]  And we're live! Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[6.20 --> 8.36]  We are going to have a fantastic show for you today.
[8.46 --> 12.88]  I'm super excited because I get to take possession of my new house today.
[13.06 --> 18.92]  So I was thinking maybe I would show Luke some pictures and maybe you guys could look at them too.
[19.74 --> 24.00]  You can... Do you guys want to watch while we look at things together?
[24.70 --> 25.74]  I've already seen the pictures.
[26.04 --> 28.00]  I was going to pretend you hadn't, so...
[28.00 --> 29.36]  I have not seen the pictures.
[29.36 --> 31.28]  This will be a first-time reaction.
[31.82 --> 33.70]  All reactions will be genuine.
[34.06 --> 35.94]  Way to spoil it for everyone.
[36.96 --> 41.78]  In other news, Microsoft has elaborated on the Windows 11 CPU requirements
[41.78 --> 46.72]  and is defending the requirement for a trusted platform module.
[46.94 --> 48.02]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[48.08 --> 48.82]  What else we got, Luke?
[50.34 --> 55.38]  There's Sony charging developers $25,000 to show up on the PlayStation Store.
[55.48 --> 57.26]  That's cool and also fun.
[57.26 --> 61.60]  And in other cool and also fun console news, there will be TV-style,
[61.72 --> 65.26]  or I would probably say mobile-style ads coming to console.
[65.72 --> 67.22]  And PC gaming!
[69.40 --> 70.42]  So cool!
[70.90 --> 72.46]  I'm so happy with this!
[72.96 --> 73.30]  Yay!
[73.30 --> 74.26]  All right.
[74.26 --> 74.76]  Yeah.
[74.76 --> 78.02]  Let's roll the intro.
[78.42 --> 79.64]  That actually sounds like the worst.
[79.88 --> 80.08]  Cool.
[80.08 --> 93.20]  Good day in the YouTube comments says,
[93.28 --> 95.20]  sell the house and get bitcoins.
[95.20 --> 100.66]  Sounds like a good strap.
[101.84 --> 102.08]  Yeah.
[102.24 --> 105.10]  That sounds like a helpful suggestion.
[106.18 --> 108.46]  The show is brought to you by Redux.
[109.04 --> 110.36]  Ridge Wallet.
[112.04 --> 112.84]  All right.
[113.04 --> 117.72]  Let's jump right into our first topic of the day.
[117.72 --> 122.32]  Microsoft has elaborated on their Windows 11 CPU requirements
[122.32 --> 126.72]  and defended the TPM requirements as well.
[126.84 --> 128.74]  So after the reveal, like, Luke,
[129.12 --> 132.52]  were you a little surprised to find out that 8th Gen Core
[132.52 --> 136.86]  and 2nd Gen Ryzen were listed as the minimum supported CPUs?
[137.40 --> 137.76]  Very.
[138.18 --> 139.64]  Extremely, I would actually say.
[139.86 --> 140.00]  Yeah.
[140.00 --> 142.98]  And this isn't one of those things where it's kind of like,
[143.10 --> 143.38]  you know,
[143.48 --> 146.54]  oh, I definitely have not seen those pictures before.
[146.70 --> 149.12]  Like, this is honest, honest surprise, right?
[150.12 --> 150.56]  Yes.
[151.18 --> 151.52]  All right.
[151.60 --> 151.88]  Because now,
[151.98 --> 152.76]  especially because...
[152.76 --> 153.56]  My world is shattered.
[153.72 --> 154.70]  My world is shaken, Luke.
[154.90 --> 156.78]  I don't know what I can trust and what I can't
[156.78 --> 158.38]  because, you know,
[158.46 --> 159.76]  I thought you were a truthful,
[159.98 --> 161.14]  a truthful kind of character.
[161.28 --> 163.92]  And now I found out you've seen all these pictures already.
[164.52 --> 164.60]  Yeah.
[165.00 --> 165.40]  Yeah.
[166.30 --> 167.42]  There's also stuff like,
[167.42 --> 168.84]  was it, I think, Vista,
[168.84 --> 170.42]  where they had this, like,
[170.48 --> 171.72]  pretty high system requirement
[171.72 --> 174.06]  and then, like, no one listened to it
[174.06 --> 175.00]  and then everyone hated Vista.
[175.66 --> 176.22]  So, like,
[176.30 --> 177.94]  but it worked on those systems
[177.94 --> 179.80]  even though it was just a bad experience.
[180.06 --> 180.46]  Yes.
[180.46 --> 183.02]  Like, it doesn't seem like that's necessarily the case.
[183.18 --> 185.02]  Like, it actually might require these.
[185.02 --> 186.60]  So, we'll get into this.
[186.74 --> 188.66]  Now, the crazy thing about it, though,
[188.68 --> 191.34]  is that some older CPUs,
[191.56 --> 192.32]  because you've got to remember,
[192.32 --> 196.40]  there's two different important dates for a CPU.
[196.60 --> 198.72]  There's the date that it actually was initially
[198.72 --> 200.14]  available commercially.
[200.62 --> 201.80]  That's date number one.
[202.10 --> 203.40]  And then date number two
[203.40 --> 204.92]  is the date that it went EOL,
[205.16 --> 207.14]  that it effectively stopped being sold.
[207.30 --> 208.20]  And here's the problem.
[208.66 --> 212.24]  Some of those CPUs that are older CPUs
[212.24 --> 214.76]  were still being sold brand new
[214.76 --> 216.54]  less than two years ago,
[216.64 --> 218.64]  like the Ryzen 5 1600 AF.
[219.52 --> 221.66]  Now, Microsoft has since announced
[221.66 --> 223.64]  that they are testing Zen 1
[223.64 --> 225.46]  and Kaby Lake CPUs
[225.46 --> 227.06]  via the Insider program.
[227.06 --> 227.66]  However,
[228.48 --> 230.34]  installing the Insider Windows 11 build
[230.34 --> 231.56]  with an unsupported CPU
[231.56 --> 232.50]  will show a message
[232.50 --> 233.82]  that says the final version
[233.82 --> 235.72]  may not be available for you
[235.72 --> 236.54]  upon release,
[236.60 --> 237.12]  which is
[237.12 --> 239.06]  a pretty big downer.
[239.74 --> 240.78]  With that said,
[240.90 --> 242.04]  our internal testing
[242.04 --> 243.16]  has Windows 11 running
[243.16 --> 245.26]  on much older CPUs.
[245.26 --> 247.26]  So, there's probably more to the story here
[247.26 --> 250.66]  than compatibility or performance.
[251.02 --> 252.36]  We actually got it running
[252.36 --> 253.34]  on a Core 2 Duo
[253.34 --> 255.22]  and we just shot a video
[255.22 --> 256.50]  on how we did that
[256.50 --> 257.70]  and it seemed to run
[257.70 --> 259.44]  completely fine.
[259.92 --> 260.52]  Like, Core 2 Duo,
[260.66 --> 261.14]  what's that,
[261.20 --> 261.88]  2007?
[264.00 --> 264.32]  2008?
[264.32 --> 265.44]  Let me see.
[266.10 --> 267.08]  Core 2 Duo,
[267.56 --> 268.10]  let me see,
[268.24 --> 269.00]  like, what's the E?
[269.06 --> 269.60]  When did the E?
[269.98 --> 270.34]  2006.
[272.34 --> 273.58]  2006, that was,
[274.18 --> 275.14]  oh wow, I'm old.
[275.14 --> 276.66]  It was 15 years ago.
[276.94 --> 277.42]  15 years.
[277.54 --> 278.36]  Holy shnikes.
[278.58 --> 278.90]  Anyway,
[279.50 --> 280.60]  the other big requirement
[280.60 --> 281.92]  that has caused issues for people
[281.92 --> 282.90]  is the TPM
[282.90 --> 285.20]  or Trusted Platform Module.
[285.86 --> 287.90]  Microsoft's PC Health Check app
[287.90 --> 288.48]  proclaimed
[288.48 --> 290.18]  that many modern PCs
[290.18 --> 291.32]  were incompatible
[291.32 --> 293.22]  due to a lack of TPM.
[294.56 --> 296.88]  The frustrating thing about that
[296.88 --> 297.32]  is that
[297.32 --> 298.72]  its only recommendation
[298.72 --> 300.20]  to rectify the problem
[300.20 --> 301.98]  was to buy a new PC.
[302.42 --> 303.88]  The PC Health Check app
[303.88 --> 304.96]  has since been pulled
[304.96 --> 306.78]  and that's
[306.78 --> 308.08]  a good thing
[308.08 --> 308.98]  because the last thing
[308.98 --> 309.66]  you want to do
[309.66 --> 310.64]  after a period
[310.64 --> 312.02]  of prolonged hardship
[312.02 --> 314.30]  around the world
[314.30 --> 315.30]  is say,
[315.68 --> 315.96]  hey,
[316.56 --> 317.28]  you know what?
[317.36 --> 318.24]  Things not working out
[318.24 --> 319.20]  for you so great.
[319.32 --> 320.28]  PC's a little old.
[320.56 --> 321.10]  You know what?
[321.16 --> 322.18]  Go buy a new one.
[322.62 --> 324.04]  Let's buy a new one.
[324.06 --> 325.68]  What are you complaining about?
[325.70 --> 326.12]  You don't just have a bunch of money
[326.12 --> 327.32]  to just go buy a new one?
[327.38 --> 328.14]  Why don't you have money
[328.14 --> 329.00]  to buy a new one,
[329.08 --> 329.98]  you slob?
[330.64 --> 330.80]  Like,
[330.96 --> 332.18]  that's the way
[332.18 --> 333.48]  a lot of people felt about it
[333.48 --> 334.52]  and that's justifiable
[334.52 --> 335.28]  because if you have
[335.28 --> 336.56]  a perfectly good computer,
[337.30 --> 338.82]  why should you suddenly
[338.82 --> 340.06]  just have to throw it away
[340.06 --> 340.86]  and buy a new one
[340.86 --> 341.74]  because you don't have
[341.74 --> 344.40]  some little validation module thing?
[345.04 --> 346.02]  And of course,
[346.14 --> 347.04]  just because
[347.04 --> 348.90]  your computer might have
[348.90 --> 349.56]  the option
[349.56 --> 350.56]  to add a TPM
[350.56 --> 351.74]  doesn't necessarily mean
[351.74 --> 352.70]  that it will be easy
[352.70 --> 353.38]  to do it.
[353.84 --> 355.22]  Scalpers immediately
[355.22 --> 357.34]  bought out stock of TPMs
[357.34 --> 358.28]  and put them up
[358.28 --> 359.26]  on sites like eBay
[359.26 --> 360.46]  for many,
[360.76 --> 361.64]  many times
[361.64 --> 362.72]  the price.
[363.58 --> 364.42]  The good news
[364.42 --> 365.34]  is that
[365.34 --> 366.32]  most platforms
[366.32 --> 367.18]  since 2015
[367.18 --> 368.36]  have a TPM
[368.36 --> 369.64]  integrated into the firmware.
[369.82 --> 370.52]  It's just disabled
[370.52 --> 371.12]  by default
[371.12 --> 372.56]  on DIY motherboards.
[373.90 --> 374.54]  So,
[375.06 --> 376.12]  all this confusion
[376.12 --> 377.30]  has led manufacturers
[377.30 --> 378.18]  like MSI
[378.18 --> 378.68]  and Gigabyte
[378.68 --> 379.70]  to make press releases
[379.70 --> 380.66]  with supported lists
[380.66 --> 381.44]  of motherboards
[381.44 --> 382.60]  that can use
[382.60 --> 383.80]  TPM 2.0.
[384.18 --> 384.66]  Although,
[385.00 --> 385.78]  here's a problem.
[385.78 --> 388.72]  Many ITX boards
[388.72 --> 389.94]  actually don't
[389.94 --> 390.82]  have
[390.82 --> 391.92]  the
[391.92 --> 393.54]  pins
[393.54 --> 394.26]  for the module
[394.26 --> 395.36]  which is a little frustrating
[395.36 --> 395.88]  because
[395.88 --> 397.06]  especially with
[397.06 --> 397.92]  high performance ones
[397.92 --> 398.88]  they're always looking
[398.88 --> 399.68]  for new ways
[399.68 --> 400.82]  to save space.
[401.20 --> 401.54]  However,
[401.96 --> 403.70]  most non-ITX boards
[403.70 --> 404.42]  since 2013
[404.42 --> 405.72]  have TPM headers
[405.72 --> 406.46]  and ever since
[406.46 --> 407.06]  Skylake
[407.06 --> 408.64]  and First Gen Ryzen
[408.64 --> 409.72]  virtually all
[409.72 --> 411.26]  have firmware TPMs.
[411.88 --> 413.04]  With that said,
[413.48 --> 414.42]  not all discrete
[414.42 --> 415.10]  TPM headers
[415.10 --> 415.68]  are the same.
[416.16 --> 417.02]  Asus and Gigabyte
[417.02 --> 417.54]  each
[417.54 --> 418.54]  have three
[418.54 --> 419.92]  different types
[419.92 --> 420.26]  of them
[420.26 --> 421.00]  all of which
[421.00 --> 421.82]  are incompatible
[421.82 --> 422.40]  with each other.
[422.66 --> 423.14]  So,
[423.40 --> 424.28]  you can't just
[424.28 --> 425.24]  go on eBay
[425.24 --> 427.06]  order a TPM module
[427.06 --> 428.44]  and plonk it
[428.44 --> 429.16]  onto your system.
[429.46 --> 430.62]  You have to make sure
[430.62 --> 431.50]  that it is compatible
[431.50 --> 432.36]  not just with
[432.36 --> 433.18]  your motherboard vendor
[433.18 --> 434.10]  but also with
[434.10 --> 435.36]  the specific model
[435.36 --> 436.04]  of motherboard
[436.04 --> 437.10]  you have.
[437.62 --> 438.00]  Now,
[438.36 --> 438.90]  Luke,
[439.54 --> 441.14]  how do you feel
[441.14 --> 442.26]  about the requirement
[442.26 --> 444.10]  of a TPM?
[444.10 --> 446.48]  It feels a little
[446.48 --> 446.98]  weird to me
[446.98 --> 447.54]  personally,
[447.78 --> 448.26]  not going to lie.
[450.54 --> 451.26]  I mean,
[451.40 --> 452.44]  we can talk
[452.44 --> 453.30]  about what it's for.
[453.48 --> 453.64]  I mean,
[453.68 --> 454.22]  one of the things
[454.22 --> 454.78]  that TPM
[454.78 --> 455.82]  is great for
[455.82 --> 456.76]  is something like
[456.76 --> 457.58]  BitLocker
[457.58 --> 458.46]  full-drive
[458.46 --> 459.12]  encryption
[459.12 --> 461.34]  because the TPM
[461.34 --> 462.62]  is a pretty
[462.62 --> 463.44]  simple device
[463.44 --> 463.78]  actually.
[463.94 --> 464.32]  It's a little
[464.32 --> 465.82]  cryptographic device
[465.82 --> 466.86]  that will generate
[466.86 --> 467.46]  it's kind of like
[467.46 --> 468.06]  it's got a random
[468.06 --> 468.80]  number generator
[468.80 --> 469.58]  built into it
[469.58 --> 470.76]  and then it stores
[470.76 --> 472.12]  the private key
[472.12 --> 473.36]  for the encryption
[473.36 --> 474.20]  so that
[474.20 --> 476.58]  it can't be
[476.58 --> 477.02]  stolen
[477.02 --> 477.68]  effectively.
[477.88 --> 478.20]  It's a little
[478.20 --> 478.64]  kind of
[478.64 --> 479.84]  you could think
[479.84 --> 480.66]  of it as
[480.66 --> 482.34]  kind of like
[482.34 --> 483.54]  Apple's T2 chip
[483.54 --> 484.90]  but way
[484.90 --> 486.26]  way less
[486.26 --> 486.90]  sophisticated.
[486.90 --> 488.74]  So it facilitates
[488.74 --> 489.70]  hardware level
[489.70 --> 490.30]  encryption
[490.30 --> 491.04]  effectively.
[492.00 --> 492.84]  It feels like
[492.84 --> 493.68]  to me
[493.68 --> 494.28]  that this
[494.28 --> 494.66]  should have
[494.66 --> 495.70]  been a
[495.70 --> 497.90]  warning campaign
[497.90 --> 499.12]  type of thing
[499.12 --> 501.04]  where Microsoft
[501.04 --> 501.56]  tries to
[501.56 --> 502.22]  because these
[502.22 --> 502.50]  things
[502.50 --> 503.80]  they theoretically
[503.80 --> 504.56]  do help.
[505.04 --> 505.72]  So I feel like
[505.72 --> 506.34]  Microsoft should
[506.34 --> 506.80]  have been like
[506.80 --> 507.50]  hey,
[507.98 --> 508.38]  you know,
[508.78 --> 509.16]  while you're
[509.16 --> 510.14]  installing Windows 11
[510.14 --> 511.10]  we highly
[511.10 --> 512.12]  freaking suggest
[512.12 --> 512.72]  that you like
[512.72 --> 513.48]  turn this thing
[513.48 --> 514.38]  on or that
[514.38 --> 514.86]  you do this
[514.86 --> 515.34]  other thing.
[515.34 --> 516.94]  I or maybe
[516.94 --> 517.84]  they even block
[517.84 --> 518.28]  you and say
[518.28 --> 518.78]  your computer
[518.78 --> 519.34]  is not ready
[519.34 --> 519.70]  and then they
[519.70 --> 520.28]  do that thing
[520.28 --> 520.64]  where there's
[520.64 --> 521.36]  like the text
[521.36 --> 522.44]  based link
[522.44 --> 523.02]  in the corner
[523.02 --> 523.54]  that's like
[523.54 --> 524.24]  I don't care
[524.24 --> 524.80]  and then you
[524.80 --> 525.24]  can bypass
[525.24 --> 525.62]  it.
[525.92 --> 526.50]  Something like
[526.50 --> 526.96]  that that
[526.96 --> 527.64]  allows people
[527.64 --> 528.42]  to acknowledge
[528.42 --> 530.58]  that Microsoft
[530.58 --> 531.08]  thinks they
[531.08 --> 531.36]  should have
[531.36 --> 531.90]  this thing
[531.90 --> 532.58]  but they can
[532.58 --> 533.06]  just install
[533.06 --> 533.52]  it anyways.
[533.98 --> 534.66]  It feels
[534.66 --> 535.12]  weird that
[535.12 --> 535.36]  it's a
[535.36 --> 535.82]  requirement.
[536.16 --> 537.24]  For OEMs
[537.24 --> 538.00]  it's been a
[538.00 --> 538.38]  requirement
[538.38 --> 539.06]  for a long
[539.06 --> 539.64]  time now.
[540.48 --> 540.94]  Like I think
[540.94 --> 541.56]  a TPM
[541.56 --> 542.84]  some kind
[542.84 --> 543.44]  of TPM
[543.44 --> 544.76]  implementation
[544.76 --> 545.42]  has been
[545.42 --> 546.30]  required for
[546.30 --> 547.32]  at least
[547.32 --> 547.94]  four or five
[547.94 --> 548.56]  years now.
[549.28 --> 550.42]  So it's been
[550.42 --> 551.32]  available to
[551.32 --> 552.76]  consumers since
[552.76 --> 554.72]  when was BitLocker
[554.72 --> 554.90]  added?
[555.00 --> 555.36]  Was that with
[555.36 --> 556.14]  Vista or
[556.14 --> 556.58]  7?
[557.70 --> 558.14]  But I mean
[558.14 --> 558.90]  we've talked
[558.90 --> 559.30]  about this on
[559.30 --> 559.92]  Wancho before
[559.92 --> 561.68]  there's Skylake
[561.68 --> 562.28]  systems
[562.28 --> 565.76]  Skylake
[565.76 --> 566.58]  am I referencing
[566.58 --> 567.18]  the right thing?
[567.34 --> 567.70]  Hold on one
[567.70 --> 567.90]  sec.
[567.90 --> 571.74]  BitLocker
[571.74 --> 572.78]  2007.
[575.34 --> 575.82]  Yeah.
[575.88 --> 576.24]  What's that?
[576.82 --> 577.22]  Yeah there's
[577.22 --> 578.24]  Skylake systems
[578.24 --> 578.74]  that people are
[578.74 --> 579.32]  still using
[579.32 --> 579.94]  and still
[579.94 --> 581.86]  gaming on
[581.86 --> 582.46]  and having
[582.46 --> 583.84]  a good old
[583.84 --> 584.46]  dandy time
[584.46 --> 584.78]  and they
[584.78 --> 585.32]  probably don't
[585.32 --> 585.66]  have the
[585.66 --> 586.14]  hardware for
[586.14 --> 586.54]  this even
[586.54 --> 587.06]  if that's
[587.06 --> 587.80]  a pre-built
[587.80 --> 588.44]  from an OEM.
[590.20 --> 590.50]  Yeah.
[590.92 --> 591.58]  No that's
[591.58 --> 592.16]  true.
[592.38 --> 592.80]  That's true.
[592.90 --> 593.04]  And they
[593.04 --> 593.50]  might want
[593.50 --> 593.82]  to run
[593.82 --> 594.54]  Windows 11
[594.54 --> 595.80]  and they
[595.80 --> 596.68]  in my opinion
[596.68 --> 597.06]  should just
[597.06 --> 597.80]  be able to
[597.80 --> 599.16]  bypass it.
[599.46 --> 599.74]  And again
[599.74 --> 600.22]  maybe they
[600.22 --> 600.54]  could do
[600.54 --> 600.88]  that like
[600.88 --> 601.58]  advanced user
[601.58 --> 602.64]  thing where
[602.64 --> 604.00]  the like
[604.00 --> 604.82]  way to bypass
[604.82 --> 605.44]  it is like
[605.44 --> 606.02]  hidden in some
[606.02 --> 606.96]  corner that
[606.96 --> 607.28]  you're probably
[607.28 --> 607.68]  not going to
[607.68 --> 608.42]  look at unless
[608.42 --> 608.76]  you know to
[608.76 --> 609.26]  look there or
[609.26 --> 609.56]  whatever.
[609.90 --> 610.36]  But I think
[610.36 --> 610.70]  there should
[610.70 --> 611.40]  I personally
[611.40 --> 611.82]  believe there
[611.82 --> 612.42]  should be some
[612.42 --> 612.80]  way to be
[612.80 --> 613.12]  like yeah
[613.12 --> 613.72]  whatever dude
[613.72 --> 614.72]  my computer's
[614.72 --> 616.90]  from 2014
[616.90 --> 617.78]  or something
[617.78 --> 618.42]  I understand
[618.42 --> 619.32]  or beyond
[619.32 --> 619.74]  like I
[619.74 --> 620.22]  understand there
[620.22 --> 620.84]  might be some
[620.84 --> 621.96]  security problems
[621.96 --> 622.34]  with the fact
[622.34 --> 622.78]  that my system
[622.78 --> 623.14]  is super
[623.14 --> 623.66]  ancient but
[623.66 --> 624.36]  I don't care.
[624.38 --> 624.66]  So here's what
[624.66 --> 625.18]  I think.
[625.34 --> 626.30]  I think that
[626.30 --> 627.54]  this is the
[627.54 --> 629.18]  warning because
[629.18 --> 631.78]  Windows 11 by
[631.78 --> 633.68]  and large has
[633.68 --> 634.76]  benefits over
[634.76 --> 636.14]  Windows 10 but
[636.14 --> 636.96]  a lot of the
[636.96 --> 637.56]  under the hood
[637.56 --> 638.44]  ones seem to
[638.44 --> 639.38]  be focused on
[639.38 --> 640.24]  newer hardware
[640.24 --> 641.44]  right like
[641.44 --> 642.52]  optimizing for
[642.52 --> 643.08]  big little
[643.08 --> 644.36]  architecture CPUs
[644.36 --> 644.90]  for example.
[645.90 --> 647.00]  Obviously if you
[647.00 --> 647.62]  are going to
[647.62 --> 648.36]  benefit yeah
[648.36 --> 649.46]  yeah touch
[649.46 --> 650.70]  devices obviously
[650.70 --> 651.30]  if you're going
[651.30 --> 652.26]  to benefit from
[652.26 --> 652.92]  some of those
[652.92 --> 654.06]  newer under the
[654.06 --> 654.70]  hood improvements
[654.70 --> 655.62]  you're going to
[655.62 --> 656.08]  meet the
[656.08 --> 657.20]  requirements for
[657.20 --> 659.24]  TPM 2.0 and
[659.24 --> 660.06]  everything's going
[660.06 --> 660.50]  to be hunky
[660.50 --> 660.78]  dory.
[661.34 --> 661.80]  And then if you
[661.80 --> 662.54]  have older
[662.54 --> 664.00]  hardware I think
[664.00 --> 665.30]  what Microsoft is
[665.30 --> 666.20]  effectively saying
[666.20 --> 667.58]  is no problem
[667.58 --> 669.02]  run Windows 10
[669.02 --> 669.26]  then.
[671.14 --> 672.44]  So that gives
[672.44 --> 673.22]  you I think the
[673.22 --> 675.12]  I think the end
[675.12 --> 676.04]  of support date
[676.04 --> 678.08]  is 2025 for
[678.08 --> 678.88]  Windows 10 which
[678.88 --> 680.58]  actually does buy
[680.58 --> 681.62]  you another four
[681.62 --> 683.50]  years to upgrade.
[683.50 --> 684.48]  so in another
[684.48 --> 686.54]  four years will
[686.54 --> 687.70]  a Skylake system
[687.70 --> 688.74]  be starting to
[688.74 --> 689.32]  get a little long
[689.32 --> 689.84]  in the tooth?
[689.92 --> 690.72]  I think that's
[690.72 --> 691.94]  probably fair to
[691.94 --> 692.22]  say.
[693.44 --> 694.48]  But I think it
[694.48 --> 695.06]  sort of already
[695.06 --> 696.34]  is but yeah.
[696.78 --> 698.30]  Well sort of I
[698.30 --> 698.94]  mean you could
[698.94 --> 699.92]  definitely play
[699.92 --> 702.26]  very AAA games
[702.26 --> 702.96]  on Skylake.
[703.02 --> 703.14]  Yeah.
[703.32 --> 703.58]  Today.
[704.00 --> 704.50]  100%.
[704.50 --> 705.32]  I mean even
[705.32 --> 706.06]  going going back
[706.06 --> 706.70]  to Haswell
[706.70 --> 707.64]  Ivy Bridge you
[707.64 --> 708.14]  could still be
[708.14 --> 709.80]  playing very very
[709.80 --> 710.82]  high-end games as
[710.82 --> 711.44]  long as you've got
[711.44 --> 712.38]  a GPU that is
[712.38 --> 712.84]  good enough.
[712.84 --> 713.92]  You do a little
[713.92 --> 714.80]  bit of overclocking
[714.80 --> 715.26]  and all of a
[715.26 --> 715.80]  sudden you're
[715.80 --> 716.26]  laughing.
[717.12 --> 718.16]  But there are
[718.16 --> 719.00]  other issues with
[719.00 --> 719.52]  running older
[719.52 --> 719.88]  hardware.
[720.02 --> 721.02]  They have more
[721.02 --> 722.44]  vulnerabilities that
[722.44 --> 723.14]  are never going to
[723.14 --> 725.70]  be patched and I
[725.70 --> 727.06]  think that expecting
[727.06 --> 728.46]  people to upgrade
[728.46 --> 730.76]  about every you
[730.76 --> 731.96]  know 10 years or
[731.96 --> 733.58]  so is not
[733.58 --> 734.82]  entirely unreasonable
[734.82 --> 736.08]  especially if you
[736.08 --> 737.38]  consider that like
[737.38 --> 738.54]  today because there
[738.54 --> 739.40]  was that long
[739.40 --> 741.06]  period of stagnation
[741.06 --> 741.96]  where we just
[741.96 --> 742.60]  didn't see the
[742.60 --> 743.14]  same kind of
[743.14 --> 743.54]  performance
[743.54 --> 744.50]  improvements that
[744.50 --> 745.18]  we that we
[745.18 --> 745.72]  used to.
[746.44 --> 747.26]  You know today we
[747.26 --> 747.92]  kind of take for
[747.92 --> 748.58]  granted that a
[748.58 --> 749.22]  10 year old
[749.22 --> 751.38]  computer it should
[751.38 --> 752.20]  be fine right.
[752.62 --> 753.12]  But can you
[753.12 --> 755.48]  imagine in 2005
[755.48 --> 757.32]  thinking that it's
[757.32 --> 758.14]  okay to run a
[758.14 --> 759.32]  computer that was
[759.32 --> 760.48]  built in 1995.
[761.48 --> 762.26]  Yeah not even
[762.26 --> 762.62]  remotely.
[763.10 --> 765.02]  Get real.
[765.02 --> 767.04]  2005 was the I
[767.04 --> 767.70]  think the Athlon
[767.70 --> 768.98]  64 was out.
[770.24 --> 771.06]  Let me have a
[771.06 --> 771.54]  look here.
[772.34 --> 773.20]  There's one of
[773.20 --> 774.06]  the wacky things
[774.06 --> 774.56]  too is like we're
[774.56 --> 775.14]  talking about Sky
[775.14 --> 775.68]  Lake and I think
[775.68 --> 776.38]  that's a very
[776.38 --> 778.00]  legitimate conversation
[778.00 --> 778.56]  but to bring it
[778.56 --> 779.50]  back even further
[779.50 --> 780.26]  like I know people
[780.26 --> 781.44]  playing modern games
[781.44 --> 782.10]  on Sandy Bridge
[782.10 --> 782.58]  processors.
[783.10 --> 783.20]  Yeah.
[784.44 --> 785.90]  Like it's it's
[785.90 --> 786.72]  100 percent.
[787.20 --> 787.68]  100 percent.
[787.76 --> 788.14]  I don't know.
[788.40 --> 789.60]  But like it's it's
[789.60 --> 790.50]  and it ties into
[790.50 --> 791.28]  that stagnation thing
[791.28 --> 791.80]  you're talking about
[791.80 --> 792.08]  etc.
[792.08 --> 793.44]  But like there's
[793.44 --> 794.40]  people running these
[794.40 --> 795.96]  old computers and
[795.96 --> 796.70]  are they're just
[796.70 --> 797.64]  still not having any
[797.64 --> 798.56]  problems and like no
[798.56 --> 800.14]  matter what the like
[800.14 --> 801.18]  the hardware community
[801.18 --> 801.94]  is like oh yeah these
[801.94 --> 802.62]  new CPUs are.
[803.34 --> 803.78]  Yeah.
[803.96 --> 805.44]  Well the vast majority
[805.44 --> 805.94]  of people aren't going
[805.94 --> 806.44]  to use that
[806.44 --> 806.96]  performance.
[807.30 --> 807.38]  Yeah.
[807.40 --> 808.04]  Maybe you will and
[808.04 --> 809.20]  that's fantastic and
[809.20 --> 810.08]  it's really exciting and
[810.08 --> 811.30]  that's that's cool but
[811.30 --> 812.50]  so I can totally
[812.50 --> 813.32]  understand why someone
[813.32 --> 814.60]  who just uses a web
[814.60 --> 815.44]  browser isn't going to
[815.44 --> 816.16]  care about upgrading
[816.16 --> 816.70]  their computer.
[816.82 --> 817.52]  So I think what's
[817.52 --> 818.34]  happening here is we
[818.34 --> 819.24]  are getting the warning
[819.24 --> 819.60]  shot.
[819.74 --> 820.44]  My Windows 10 is
[820.44 --> 821.14]  going to keep getting
[821.14 --> 823.14]  support till 2025 which
[823.14 --> 823.96]  means that you'll
[823.96 --> 825.24]  realistically be able to
[825.24 --> 826.36]  keep using it for a
[826.36 --> 827.38]  little while after that
[827.38 --> 828.02]  if you want to.
[828.12 --> 829.64]  It won't be until after
[829.64 --> 831.30]  2025 that the install
[831.30 --> 832.62]  base will really start
[832.62 --> 834.30]  to dwindle and you'll
[834.30 --> 835.14]  start to see game
[835.14 --> 837.16]  developers not supporting
[837.16 --> 838.42]  the OS or you'll start
[838.42 --> 839.80]  to see companies like
[839.80 --> 841.18]  NVIDIA or AMD pull
[841.18 --> 842.02]  driver support.
[842.22 --> 844.12]  So realistically you
[844.12 --> 845.20]  could still be running
[845.20 --> 846.92]  your machine from 2015
[846.92 --> 850.70]  until 2025, 2026, 2027
[850.70 --> 851.90]  if you want to push it
[851.90 --> 852.54]  and you're willing to
[852.54 --> 853.80]  roll that die in terms
[853.80 --> 854.76]  of security updates.
[855.66 --> 856.94]  And you know in the
[856.94 --> 858.90]  context of going from
[858.90 --> 860.90]  okay Windows 95 right
[860.90 --> 861.90]  you would have been
[861.90 --> 863.92]  running a Pentium 2 if
[863.92 --> 864.90]  you were state-of-the-art.
[865.44 --> 865.60]  Okay.
[865.74 --> 865.94]  Yeah.
[866.02 --> 867.90]  You were running 266
[867.90 --> 869.64]  megahertz back in 1995.
[869.64 --> 872.66]  In May of 2005 you
[872.66 --> 873.50]  were running an Athlon
[873.50 --> 876.16]  64X2 if you were if
[876.16 --> 877.14]  you were state-of-the-art.
[877.36 --> 877.54]  Okay.
[878.38 --> 881.96]  So yes the hardware
[881.96 --> 883.92]  hasn't moved forward in
[883.92 --> 885.64]  that way over the last
[885.64 --> 886.00]  10 years.
[886.00 --> 886.12]  Yeah.
[886.12 --> 887.62]  But that doesn't mean
[887.62 --> 889.16]  that computing hasn't
[889.16 --> 890.16]  changed that much in 10
[890.16 --> 891.18]  years and that we don't
[891.18 --> 892.98]  need to do something
[892.98 --> 895.82]  about standardizing the
[895.82 --> 896.80]  platform that people are
[896.80 --> 897.64]  running on in some
[897.64 --> 898.30]  meaningful way.
[898.50 --> 899.62]  And Microsoft's
[899.64 --> 900.98]  justification for this
[900.98 --> 902.58]  ultimately does kind of
[902.58 --> 904.08]  make sense to me even if
[904.08 --> 905.80]  I'm not thrilled about
[905.80 --> 906.00]  it.
[906.42 --> 908.12]  In a nutshell they say
[908.12 --> 909.72]  look this comes down to
[909.72 --> 910.52]  security.
[911.54 --> 913.30]  Microsoft claims that
[913.30 --> 915.28]  PCs using a TPM and
[915.28 --> 916.50]  secure boot reported
[916.50 --> 918.80]  60% less malware thanks to
[918.80 --> 919.86]  virtualization based
[919.86 --> 920.38]  security.
[921.26 --> 922.42]  And if Microsoft
[922.42 --> 923.24]  wants to stay
[923.24 --> 923.72]  competitive.
[923.72 --> 924.00]  A lot of attacks are in
[924.00 --> 924.84]  that vector these days.
[924.98 --> 925.30]  Exactly.
[925.70 --> 926.70]  If Microsoft wants to
[926.70 --> 927.82]  stay competitive with
[927.82 --> 929.44]  Apple and Google
[929.44 --> 930.66]  so Google doesn't even
[930.66 --> 932.00]  have 10 year old hardware
[932.00 --> 933.26]  to deal with on Chrome OS
[933.26 --> 935.36]  and then Apple just gets to
[935.36 --> 936.66]  deprecate things whenever it
[936.66 --> 937.94]  pleases them because they're
[937.94 --> 939.42]  so vertically integrated and
[939.42 --> 940.50]  their customers will just
[940.50 --> 941.10]  accept it.
[943.10 --> 944.90]  If Microsoft wants to do
[944.90 --> 947.06]  something to move Windows
[947.06 --> 948.74]  security forward like as a
[948.74 --> 949.92]  platform as something that
[949.92 --> 951.86]  they can really message
[951.86 --> 952.54]  about.
[952.54 --> 954.42]  I actually think that this
[954.42 --> 955.54]  could be a big part of the
[955.54 --> 956.60]  reason that Windows 11
[956.60 --> 958.06]  exists at all.
[959.34 --> 961.28]  So I don't see them backing
[961.28 --> 963.40]  down from this and I it's
[963.40 --> 964.70]  Windows there's going to be
[964.70 --> 966.12]  hacky ways to do it
[966.12 --> 966.60]  probably.
[967.42 --> 969.04]  But I don't think that
[969.04 --> 970.38]  Microsoft is going to
[970.38 --> 972.74]  endorse them in any way and
[972.74 --> 973.86]  the industry is going to be
[973.86 --> 975.56]  expected to adapt because we
[975.56 --> 977.90]  have you know four to six
[977.90 --> 979.92]  years to kind of figure it
[979.92 --> 981.36]  out and at some point
[981.36 --> 982.84]  Windows has to get more
[982.84 --> 984.08]  secure and if this is the
[984.08 --> 985.26]  way they've identified to do
[985.26 --> 987.10]  it then Windows 11 is this
[987.10 --> 989.18]  clear line in the sand that
[989.18 --> 990.88]  Microsoft is drawing that
[990.88 --> 992.80]  goes okay Windows 10 you know
[992.80 --> 993.66]  what it wasn't as good and
[993.66 --> 995.54]  this is why and you can keep
[995.54 --> 997.14]  using it for a while but guys
[997.14 --> 999.00]  you will have to upgrade even
[999.00 --> 999.92]  if you don't have to do it
[999.92 --> 1000.22]  today.
[1000.22 --> 1004.60]  Yeah that makes sense that
[1004.60 --> 1005.20]  does make sense.
[1005.80 --> 1007.16]  Most of the most of the
[1007.16 --> 1007.86]  improvements like you're
[1007.86 --> 1009.40]  mentioning are kind of
[1009.40 --> 1011.20]  quality of life stuff.
[1011.70 --> 1011.84]  Yep.
[1012.40 --> 1012.84]  Absolutely.
[1013.14 --> 1014.30]  You don't have to move on
[1014.30 --> 1014.88]  from Windows 10.
[1015.40 --> 1016.90]  Actually okay one thing we
[1016.90 --> 1019.56]  don't know is whether this is
[1019.56 --> 1020.76]  a really critical feature that
[1020.76 --> 1022.00]  I'm excited for direct
[1022.00 --> 1023.74]  storage so the GPU's ability
[1023.74 --> 1025.10]  to access your storage
[1025.10 --> 1025.62]  directly.
[1026.80 --> 1028.30]  But then now that I think
[1028.30 --> 1030.10]  about it actually no one's
[1030.10 --> 1031.10]  going to be running PCI
[1031.10 --> 1033.78]  Express Gen 4 and not have
[1033.78 --> 1034.56]  TPM 2.0.
[1035.14 --> 1035.36]  Yep.
[1036.18 --> 1037.78]  So the whole thing the
[1037.78 --> 1039.16]  whole it's all wait where's
[1039.16 --> 1040.72]  that cronk I need that cronk
[1040.72 --> 1042.24]  gif it's all coming together.
[1042.76 --> 1045.14]  It all makes sense now if the
[1045.14 --> 1046.74]  if the benefits of Windows
[1046.74 --> 1049.60]  11 are performance benefits
[1049.60 --> 1050.82]  but that are applicable
[1050.82 --> 1052.72]  mainly to very modern systems
[1052.72 --> 1054.84]  then it makes perfect sense
[1054.84 --> 1057.24]  to just kind of say okay well
[1057.24 --> 1058.34]  then modern systems are going
[1058.34 --> 1059.68]  to run Windows 11 and not
[1059.68 --> 1060.58]  modern systems are going to
[1060.58 --> 1062.86]  run Windows 10 and no one
[1062.86 --> 1065.02]  should really be that upset
[1065.02 --> 1066.84]  about it because you can just
[1066.84 --> 1068.00]  run Windows 10 and you'll have
[1068.00 --> 1069.24]  a just fine experience like you
[1069.24 --> 1069.48]  have.
[1069.74 --> 1071.12]  There are some other problems.
[1072.68 --> 1076.88]  Toad to g says yeah TPM is a
[1076.88 --> 1077.50]  repair nightmare.
[1078.14 --> 1080.44]  That is super true.
[1081.00 --> 1083.14]  Having having like encryption
[1083.14 --> 1085.58]  keys tied to the CPU and the
[1085.58 --> 1087.44]  motherboard socket is going to
[1087.44 --> 1089.24]  be a real nightmare for people
[1089.24 --> 1091.64]  who don't practice good data
[1091.64 --> 1095.72]  storage best practices because
[1095.72 --> 1098.24]  if you just run your machine
[1098.24 --> 1101.14]  you store all of your data right
[1101.14 --> 1102.84]  on your boot drive and you have
[1102.84 --> 1104.14]  some kind of problem you take it
[1104.14 --> 1105.56]  into a shop they have to swap out
[1105.56 --> 1107.44]  some hardware you could be in for
[1107.44 --> 1109.22]  an extremely bad time.
[1109.32 --> 1111.38]  There could just be no way to
[1111.38 --> 1112.84]  access your data unless you stored
[1112.84 --> 1114.30]  your backup key somewhere that you
[1114.30 --> 1115.30]  can actually get at it.
[1117.08 --> 1118.50]  Could be bad you know you have a
[1118.50 --> 1120.18]  water cooling leak right so you
[1120.18 --> 1121.78]  you lose a CPU and motherboard at
[1121.78 --> 1122.54]  the same time.
[1123.48 --> 1124.70]  Could be very problematic.
[1125.34 --> 1127.02]  I mean I've been advocating for a
[1127.02 --> 1130.38]  long time for people to just not
[1130.38 --> 1132.50]  store any data on their computers
[1132.50 --> 1135.50]  but the reality of it is is I
[1135.50 --> 1137.56]  remember back when I didn't have
[1137.56 --> 1139.80]  the kind of money to just have an
[1139.80 --> 1141.46]  extra computer to keep all my hard
[1141.46 --> 1141.96]  drives in.
[1142.66 --> 1144.74]  That wasn't that was that was
[1144.74 --> 1147.36]  just not possible even though you
[1147.36 --> 1149.70]  can build a decent NAS for a couple
[1149.70 --> 1150.54]  hundred dollars.
[1151.00 --> 1151.88]  I mean you want to talk about
[1151.88 --> 1153.12]  dollars is not is not necessarily
[1153.12 --> 1155.40]  accessible to exactly for a huge
[1155.40 --> 1155.96]  range of people.
[1156.20 --> 1156.52]  Exactly.
[1156.88 --> 1159.24]  I mean that is one benefit though of
[1159.24 --> 1161.96]  the of the kind of the stagnation
[1161.96 --> 1163.76]  that took place for so long is lots
[1163.76 --> 1164.76]  of people have upgraded their
[1164.76 --> 1166.70]  computers to get better performance
[1166.70 --> 1170.22]  but the hardware that is now orphaned
[1170.22 --> 1173.60]  is very very usable and as long as
[1173.60 --> 1174.62]  you don't mind dealing with the
[1174.62 --> 1176.60]  extra power consumption it is
[1176.60 --> 1179.42]  amazingly affordable to build
[1179.42 --> 1180.84]  yourself a cheap NAS.
[1181.36 --> 1183.22]  Like think about it you don't even
[1183.22 --> 1185.08]  need a GPU you don't even need
[1185.08 --> 1186.70]  anything that's in shortage because
[1186.70 --> 1188.66]  Intel's been building in onboard
[1188.66 --> 1190.48]  graphics for over 10 years now.
[1190.92 --> 1193.22]  That's fantastic you just get an old
[1193.22 --> 1195.60]  cheap board CPU throw some crap RAM
[1195.60 --> 1197.76]  from eBay in it and you're off to the
[1197.76 --> 1199.94]  races especially if it's idling all
[1199.94 --> 1201.96]  the time it is way less problematic
[1201.96 --> 1203.50]  in terms of power consumption compared
[1203.50 --> 1205.42]  to if you are actually doing
[1205.42 --> 1206.98]  something heavy like you're using it
[1206.98 --> 1209.98]  for Plex transcoding or something
[1209.98 --> 1210.82]  along those lines.
[1212.74 --> 1216.48]  Yeah I wonder probably not much but I
[1216.48 --> 1219.64]  do wonder what this might do for
[1219.64 --> 1223.74]  Linux advocacy because a lot of this
[1223.74 --> 1225.78]  old hardware like we've been talking
[1225.78 --> 1228.56]  is still legit especially if what
[1228.56 --> 1231.28]  you're doing is not heavy if you're
[1231.28 --> 1232.96]  not gaming if you're not video
[1232.96 --> 1236.70]  editing if you're not doing heavy
[1236.70 --> 1238.52]  things like that there's a wide range
[1238.52 --> 1239.68]  of the modeling etc.
[1240.68 --> 1242.46]  If you're doing word processing if
[1242.46 --> 1244.06]  you're browsing the web if you're if
[1244.06 --> 1244.22]  you're
[1244.22 --> 1246.94]  yeah there's a there's there's a lot
[1246.94 --> 1247.84]  of things you can do on your computer
[1247.84 --> 1249.62]  that isn't necessarily what a lot of
[1249.62 --> 1252.18]  this audience is doing and once
[1252.18 --> 1255.36]  Windows 10 stops being supported
[1255.36 --> 1259.68]  it's those types of tasks are actually
[1259.68 --> 1262.38]  very easy for the average user to pick
[1262.38 --> 1265.20]  up on non-complicated Linux distros.
[1265.38 --> 1266.50]  This is interesting.
[1266.96 --> 1269.48]  Gabriel Garcia has a super chat in here
[1269.48 --> 1272.10]  one benefit of the min spec being
[1272.10 --> 1275.06]  Coffee Lake slash Ryzen 2 is that
[1275.06 --> 1277.26]  Win 11 apps can target extensions like
[1277.26 --> 1281.16]  AVX 2 directly. Yep that is a huge
[1281.16 --> 1283.32]  benefit all of a sudden having this
[1283.32 --> 1285.18]  kind of clear line in the sand for
[1285.18 --> 1288.00]  what developers can expect from a
[1288.00 --> 1290.14]  system that's running an OS makes it
[1290.14 --> 1292.26]  a lot cleaner to optimize your apps.
[1292.50 --> 1294.04]  Yep that is you're probably going to
[1294.04 --> 1295.96]  see more and we saw this kind of
[1295.96 --> 1297.36]  stuff and it annoyed the hell out of
[1297.36 --> 1299.42]  me with with companies like Elgato
[1299.42 --> 1301.52]  despite them making tons of fantastic
[1301.52 --> 1304.54]  and amazing things their their stream
[1304.54 --> 1306.36]  deck was only supported on Windows 10
[1306.36 --> 1308.36]  for like a super long time when Windows
[1308.36 --> 1309.96]  8 Windows 7 were still very viable
[1309.96 --> 1311.66]  operating systems. I think you'll see
[1311.66 --> 1313.78]  significantly more of that with Windows
[1313.78 --> 1315.38]  11 if if that's the case.
[1316.52 --> 1318.50]  But yeah I think I think the low end
[1318.50 --> 1320.96]  system game more than ever even though
[1320.96 --> 1322.22]  it's already a bit of a thing I think
[1322.22 --> 1324.66]  the low end system game might look a lot
[1324.66 --> 1327.98]  more Linuxy for the next while.
[1328.22 --> 1329.54]  Someone in Flowplane chat said Linux
[1329.54 --> 1331.00]  will run on a potato and I'm like yeah
[1331.00 --> 1332.74]  that's that's my point kind of.
[1332.74 --> 1333.84]  Yep exactly.
[1333.84 --> 1335.28]  There's a lot of these older systems it
[1335.28 --> 1337.72]  could be a very fantastic answer for it.
[1338.12 --> 1339.64]  It'll be it'll be interesting to see if
[1339.64 --> 1342.12]  anything does kind of shift more than it
[1342.12 --> 1343.36]  already has in that realm.
[1343.74 --> 1345.54]  The real tech guy says okay but like as
[1345.54 --> 1346.96]  someone who works in a computer repair
[1346.96 --> 1349.90]  shop from a customer's perspective why
[1349.90 --> 1351.06]  should I have to have a NAS?
[1351.46 --> 1353.10]  That's that's a that's such a great
[1353.10 --> 1355.14]  question. So when someone comes into the
[1355.14 --> 1356.60]  shop and they go why should I have to
[1356.60 --> 1359.42]  have a NAS? The answer is you shouldn't.
[1359.42 --> 1362.64]  But then if you want the simpler the
[1362.64 --> 1366.24]  simple easy magic bullet then what you
[1366.24 --> 1367.92]  need to do is you just need to pay for
[1367.92 --> 1369.36]  your OneDrive or your Google Drive
[1369.36 --> 1371.48]  subscription and you need to practice
[1371.48 --> 1373.80]  good data management and you need to
[1373.80 --> 1374.98]  make sure that everything is backed up
[1374.98 --> 1376.70]  there. That's the answer.
[1377.06 --> 1379.08]  So are they trying to sell OneDrive?
[1379.08 --> 1381.18]  So what? No, no, no, no, no.
[1381.18 --> 1382.10]  I just mean that.
[1382.14 --> 1382.64]  No, no, no, no.
[1382.64 --> 1383.48]  I'm not saying you.
[1383.48 --> 1384.28]  I'm saying are they?
[1384.60 --> 1386.24]  No, no, I'm that's my answer.
[1386.24 --> 1388.98]  That's my answer. If you don't want to
[1388.98 --> 1389.60]  worry about.
[1389.60 --> 1392.00]  Oh, oh, oh, I see what you mean.
[1392.42 --> 1394.76]  So that that is the answer, though.
[1394.82 --> 1397.00]  So if you have heavy data requirements,
[1397.00 --> 1399.04]  the answer is you need to make sure that
[1399.04 --> 1400.54]  everything is on a NAS and all your
[1400.54 --> 1402.50]  machines are doing regular nightly backups.
[1402.74 --> 1404.42]  And if you don't have heavy data
[1404.42 --> 1406.46]  requirements, the answer is cloud storage
[1406.46 --> 1407.88]  has gotten so affordable.
[1407.88 --> 1411.80]  I mean, the sponsor that we work with all
[1411.80 --> 1414.40]  the time, the 45 drives builds their
[1414.40 --> 1416.76]  builds their storage box back, back
[1416.76 --> 1417.16]  place, back place.
[1417.24 --> 1418.12]  Yeah, back place.
[1418.54 --> 1421.66]  It's super affordable to back things up
[1421.66 --> 1422.62]  to the cloud these days.
[1422.62 --> 1424.72]  There's just no excuse anymore.
[1425.02 --> 1427.46]  So from a tech shop's perspective, the
[1427.46 --> 1430.24]  answer is educating your customers about
[1430.24 --> 1431.98]  what their options are to ensure that
[1431.98 --> 1433.40]  they're not going to lose their data.
[1433.90 --> 1436.48]  It's it's and if they if they don't think
[1436.48 --> 1438.04]  it's important because I used to I used
[1438.04 --> 1439.60]  to work in a tech shop and lots of people
[1439.60 --> 1441.30]  would be like, I don't need data backup.
[1441.30 --> 1442.22]  I don't care about my stuff.
[1442.22 --> 1445.18]  I always bring up the the wedding and
[1445.18 --> 1448.40]  baby pictures argument because then
[1448.40 --> 1450.28]  they're like, oh, wait, I can't lose
[1450.28 --> 1450.68]  those.
[1450.68 --> 1451.82]  And I'm like, yeah, where are you storing
[1451.82 --> 1452.06]  them?
[1452.54 --> 1455.60]  Yeah, it's like, OK, well, maybe you
[1455.60 --> 1457.86]  should consider something like what if
[1457.86 --> 1459.14]  you if you don't want to put that stuff
[1459.14 --> 1460.30]  in the cloud, there's some things you
[1460.30 --> 1461.42]  might not want in the cloud no matter
[1461.42 --> 1464.00]  what you can do local storage with the
[1464.00 --> 1466.84]  three things where you have like on the
[1466.84 --> 1469.10]  device on a similar device that might be
[1469.10 --> 1470.84]  in the same area and then on a on a
[1470.84 --> 1472.28]  hopefully different type of device in an
[1472.28 --> 1473.42]  area that is very far away.
[1473.80 --> 1475.80]  You can do that thing if you can afford
[1475.80 --> 1478.04]  it and if you can maintain it or you can
[1478.04 --> 1479.14]  just go with the cloud, whatever.
[1479.26 --> 1480.66]  But you should have more than one copy of
[1480.66 --> 1480.96]  your data.
[1481.38 --> 1482.08]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1482.30 --> 1484.78]  I you know what was what was the eureka
[1484.78 --> 1487.18]  moment for me when I when I learned that
[1487.18 --> 1489.70]  my data needed to be back rated and backed
[1489.70 --> 1498.02]  up when I learned how a when I learned how a
[1498.02 --> 1498.84]  hard drive works.
[1500.80 --> 1503.68]  That was the moment for me because it's
[1503.68 --> 1504.02]  wild.
[1504.98 --> 1506.76]  It's nuts.
[1507.14 --> 1511.18]  OK, like if you've ever actually seen the
[1511.18 --> 1512.54]  read and write head, right?
[1512.88 --> 1515.50]  If you've seen it move back and forth over
[1515.50 --> 1517.98]  the spinning disk, OK, at seventy two hundred
[1517.98 --> 1520.32]  RPM, I remember I remember someone from
[1520.32 --> 1522.20]  Western Digital explaining this to me once
[1522.20 --> 1524.48]  they're like, yeah, at the outer edge of
[1524.48 --> 1527.46]  the spinning disk, you know, keeping that
[1527.46 --> 1528.36]  head stable.
[1528.60 --> 1530.64]  It's a real it's a real engineering challenge
[1530.64 --> 1533.60]  because effectively it's ripping around in
[1533.60 --> 1535.08]  hurricane force winds.
[1535.74 --> 1536.24]  And I'm like.
[1538.74 --> 1539.30]  What?
[1540.54 --> 1541.68]  Hold on a second.
[1541.68 --> 1544.64]  My precious memories are on this thing.
[1545.06 --> 1545.74]  Excuse me.
[1545.88 --> 1547.36]  I need to go for a minute.
[1547.36 --> 1547.68]  And.
[1549.60 --> 1550.62]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[1550.92 --> 1552.82]  And the fact that they like basically never
[1552.82 --> 1555.08]  fail unless you drop them is is pretty nuts
[1555.08 --> 1555.44]  as well.
[1555.58 --> 1556.16]  I don't know.
[1556.36 --> 1557.10]  Obviously they do.
[1557.16 --> 1558.48]  But like I have hard drives that have been
[1558.48 --> 1560.92]  running for a decade, basically.
[1561.14 --> 1561.84]  It's unbelievable.
[1562.50 --> 1563.14]  It's nuts.
[1564.34 --> 1566.72]  But but yeah, back up your data, even if you
[1566.72 --> 1569.60]  think you don't care now to maybe some of the
[1569.60 --> 1571.22]  younger audience, I would say.
[1571.92 --> 1572.98]  There's stupid stuff.
[1573.22 --> 1576.48]  I had this amazing wallpaper once.
[1576.90 --> 1579.32]  It was like a really great ultra wide wallpaper.
[1579.56 --> 1582.90]  It had like it had like a horse and cart or
[1582.90 --> 1584.82]  something and it was like labeled with like
[1584.82 --> 1585.68]  console stuff.
[1585.68 --> 1587.16]  And then there was some faster thing and it
[1587.16 --> 1587.98]  was PC or something.
[1588.08 --> 1590.04]  It was this really cool cartoon.
[1590.04 --> 1591.52]  I think I remember that picture.
[1591.52 --> 1594.32]  Yeah, I had it on my desktop at at the old
[1594.32 --> 1595.56]  office, the old Langley house.
[1595.56 --> 1597.48]  And I don't know.
[1597.54 --> 1599.62]  I just like I've tried to find it again and I
[1599.62 --> 1600.60]  can't find it.
[1600.66 --> 1601.74]  And I'm like, oh, that sucks.
[1601.82 --> 1604.34]  I wish I had I wish I'd put it somewhere because
[1604.34 --> 1608.02]  having everything instantly available at your
[1608.02 --> 1611.16]  fingertips has been great in a lot of ways.
[1611.16 --> 1611.42]  Right.
[1611.46 --> 1613.48]  Like everything's a quick Google search away,
[1613.68 --> 1616.74]  except for things that are gone.
[1616.74 --> 1620.46]  because the Internet has gotten so big and so
[1620.46 --> 1624.42]  broad that it's so easy now for things to
[1624.42 --> 1625.76]  disappear forever.
[1625.76 --> 1627.62]  There's this great flash game I used to play
[1627.62 --> 1629.98]  called Pearl Harbor, where you're this you're
[1629.98 --> 1631.96]  this plane and you go back and forth, back and
[1631.96 --> 1632.12]  forth.
[1632.12 --> 1633.58]  Every time you get to the end of the scene, it
[1633.58 --> 1635.16]  just kind of turns around and you're fighting
[1635.16 --> 1635.58]  something.
[1635.68 --> 1637.64]  I don't I don't remember exactly how it played
[1637.64 --> 1640.62]  anymore because one day it disappeared and you
[1640.62 --> 1641.34]  can't play it anymore.
[1641.68 --> 1643.10]  It's that experience is gone.
[1643.80 --> 1645.58]  There's that whole saying like the Internet
[1645.58 --> 1648.76]  remembers and it's like, yeah, unless it doesn't.
[1649.48 --> 1652.00]  And in a lot of cases, it does.
[1652.00 --> 1655.84]  But in a lot of cases, due to the sheer size of
[1655.84 --> 1658.00]  the Internet, it doesn't.
[1658.52 --> 1662.38]  It's just sites will go down and all your stuff's
[1662.38 --> 1663.46]  just gone.
[1664.88 --> 1666.56]  So back it up.
[1666.68 --> 1669.72]  I know a lot of the kids watching aren't going to
[1669.72 --> 1673.70]  take this to heart because I sure didn't.
[1673.70 --> 1676.04]  But the memories that you have and like the photos
[1676.04 --> 1678.28]  and stuff that you have now, back them up.
[1678.42 --> 1679.06]  You'll care later.
[1679.32 --> 1680.16]  I have not care now.
[1680.32 --> 1680.92]  You'll care later.
[1681.12 --> 1684.22]  I have lost a big chunk of photos once.
[1685.04 --> 1686.54]  It was really hard.
[1687.08 --> 1687.92]  It was really rough.
[1688.98 --> 1689.10]  Yeah.
[1689.10 --> 1690.10]  Yeah.
[1691.82 --> 1694.44]  People in float plane chat are talking about their
[1694.44 --> 1697.46]  are talking about their bad experiences, losing data.
[1698.52 --> 1700.90]  Neo Cortez says, then your house burns down is
[1700.90 --> 1701.56]  burgled or flooded.
[1701.72 --> 1703.66]  So there are solutions to these things.
[1704.20 --> 1707.58]  I have a fireproof NAS at my house that I actually use
[1707.58 --> 1709.40]  for extremely important things.
[1710.20 --> 1712.68]  I can't fit everything on it because it's just a two
[1712.68 --> 1713.54]  hard drive NAS.
[1713.54 --> 1716.24]  So it's just two drives and raid one, but you should
[1716.24 --> 1720.24]  absolutely have some kind of contingency.
[1720.38 --> 1722.94]  Also, conveniently, I have a super fast internet
[1722.94 --> 1724.60]  connection both at home and at the office.
[1724.60 --> 1727.78]  And I have keys to the server room so I can put things
[1727.78 --> 1729.44]  at the office if I really want to.
[1729.58 --> 1730.16]  Ha ha ha ha.
[1730.80 --> 1734.46]  But off continent or off like general geographic area
[1734.46 --> 1735.44]  is also a very good idea.
[1735.50 --> 1737.86]  Like if you if you're planning on backing up data and it's
[1737.86 --> 1740.88]  not in the cloud, it's that that three stages thing at a
[1740.88 --> 1742.52]  minimum is very important.
[1743.00 --> 1744.22]  Raid doesn't count.
[1744.50 --> 1747.42]  It should be raided, but raid does not count.
[1748.00 --> 1752.50]  I am surprised that there isn't kind of like an open
[1752.50 --> 1758.46]  source, super easy to use community based like, hey, you
[1758.46 --> 1762.50]  know, I'll show you my data if you show me yours kind of
[1762.50 --> 1763.46]  backup app.
[1763.50 --> 1767.34]  I've been pushing the unraid guys to build this forever.
[1767.34 --> 1771.82]  Ever like unraid friends or something like that, where what
[1771.82 --> 1775.30]  I want is fairly straightforward, just built right into the
[1775.30 --> 1775.68]  OS.
[1775.68 --> 1780.42]  I can friend someone effectively and we can allocate.
[1781.54 --> 1786.02]  We can we can cross allocate a shared storage space to each
[1786.02 --> 1786.28]  other.
[1786.28 --> 1790.32]  And then it will effectively just take whatever I want to put in
[1790.32 --> 1795.62]  my in my offsite important folder or I'll flag certain folders
[1795.62 --> 1797.32]  as as key folders.
[1797.56 --> 1801.26]  It'll synchronize them to my friend's server and store an encrypted
[1801.26 --> 1803.16]  copy locally on their server.
[1803.36 --> 1806.54]  And then I can effectively take some of my storage and give them
[1806.54 --> 1807.24]  the same thing.
[1807.36 --> 1809.36]  Now, you can set up stuff like this.
[1809.40 --> 1810.40]  You can do it manually.
[1810.72 --> 1814.72]  But I think it's the kind of thing I've told them for years now.
[1814.72 --> 1817.40]  I think it's the kind of thing that could really set their
[1817.40 --> 1818.14]  software apart.
[1818.28 --> 1819.32]  You can do it.
[1820.30 --> 1820.88]  What's that?
[1821.00 --> 1822.66]  I would get evangelical about that.
[1822.92 --> 1826.30]  I and I know, obviously, yeah, you can do this yourself and
[1826.30 --> 1827.10]  quite a few people do.
[1827.82 --> 1831.84]  But some of the you got to consider, like if you are the tech
[1831.84 --> 1835.64]  person in this like manual setup, you now have to maintain this
[1835.64 --> 1838.54]  for as many people as you you enter into that agreement.
[1838.96 --> 1839.40]  Exactly.
[1839.68 --> 1841.48]  And I would love like to have this.
[1841.48 --> 1845.76]  I would I would love to just like basically sell little boxes that
[1845.76 --> 1848.06]  I'm obviously not making money on, but sell little boxes to like
[1848.06 --> 1851.60]  my whole family and just be like, OK, we're creating a friend's
[1851.60 --> 1852.84]  storage pool on Unraid.
[1853.32 --> 1855.84]  It works updated every once in a while.
[1856.24 --> 1856.84]  See you later.
[1858.00 --> 1860.22]  Like that would be that would be great.
[1860.42 --> 1861.06]  I don't know.
[1861.76 --> 1863.36]  I'd go nuts with that.
[1863.44 --> 1867.16]  But I'd try to get basically everyone I knew because like it's it
[1867.16 --> 1871.92]  really sucks being the tech person for your group of people and
[1871.92 --> 1876.18]  then having someone be like, oh, I my laptop got wet or something.
[1876.36 --> 1877.92]  I lost all my wedding photos.
[1878.04 --> 1880.58]  And it's like, yeah, I told you to do backups for that.
[1880.72 --> 1883.30]  And you didn't because I guess it was complicated or whatever.
[1883.56 --> 1886.24]  And it would be great if like there was just some.
[1886.34 --> 1886.98]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1887.10 --> 1887.82]  I would like that.
[1887.94 --> 1889.90]  I'd be unread homies with you.
[1890.24 --> 1891.04]  Yeah, for sure.
[1891.12 --> 1891.52]  For sure.
[1891.52 --> 1893.56]  And like I would like in a minute.
[1893.82 --> 1897.02]  Yeah, I would just throw like a giant Unraid box at the office
[1897.02 --> 1899.64]  and everyone could just have their encrypted data on there.
[1899.76 --> 1902.76]  I've got some people saying like, hey, you know, what about if
[1902.76 --> 1905.20]  someone got busted with illegal content?
[1906.02 --> 1906.46]  Sure.
[1906.64 --> 1909.50]  But it's it's encrypted.
[1910.48 --> 1914.96]  So whatever illegal content they have, you got to you got to imagine
[1914.96 --> 1919.90]  think of it kind of like if, you know, someone put child pornography
[1919.90 --> 1920.86]  in their Dropbox.
[1921.88 --> 1924.38]  Dropbox is not in possession of the child pornography.
[1924.38 --> 1926.70]  That is encrypted data that they can't even read.
[1927.74 --> 1930.70]  Ultimately, whoever put it there is the one who would be in trouble
[1930.70 --> 1931.40]  in that case.
[1931.40 --> 1936.74]  So there should be no reason from like a personal criminal liability
[1936.74 --> 1938.38]  standpoint that it would matter.
[1938.76 --> 1944.06]  I would also think, though, that you'd want you'd want your Unraid homies
[1944.06 --> 1946.44]  to be people you know and mostly trust anyway.
[1946.44 --> 1951.44]  But friend friend raid coming soon to LTT stores as Jamer Jamer person.
[1952.14 --> 1952.74]  Yeah, exactly.
[1953.08 --> 1954.18]  Synology has that feature.
[1954.60 --> 1958.24]  The last time that I tried to mess with it, it wasn't exactly what
[1958.24 --> 1958.94]  Linus is saying.
[1959.30 --> 1960.64]  It can be done.
[1960.82 --> 1961.72]  It's kludgy.
[1962.24 --> 1965.44]  And Synology NASs are well, they're Synology.
[1966.16 --> 1967.30]  It's not cross platform.
[1968.26 --> 1972.52]  So what I want is a way to just do it on something that runs on cheap
[1972.52 --> 1973.42]  commodity hardware.
[1973.42 --> 1974.42]  Yeah.
[1975.36 --> 1979.84]  Yeah, because you like I just gave the that probably I probably put that
[1979.84 --> 1982.44]  person down that path because I said I would just sell my family these
[1982.44 --> 1982.98]  little boxes.
[1982.98 --> 1986.76]  But that's that's not particularly what I mean.
[1986.82 --> 1988.44]  Like my my brother's pretty techie.
[1988.48 --> 1989.76]  My dad's pretty techie, etc.
[1991.06 --> 1993.80]  They would probably just want to use some old computer hardware that they
[1993.80 --> 1995.60]  had laying around and connect some drives to it.
[1995.60 --> 1998.68]  Like it's they wouldn't want to buy a new Synology NAS.
[1998.76 --> 2000.22]  Like, yeah, it's it's different.
[2000.22 --> 2000.98]  Yeah.
[2002.02 --> 2004.30]  People are saying try explaining that to a judge.
[2004.38 --> 2006.12]  I don't have to explain that to a judge.
[2006.18 --> 2007.90]  You guys don't think this has ever come up.
[2008.40 --> 2010.66]  But come on, guys, you got to you got to use this.
[2010.78 --> 2011.32]  Come up many times.
[2011.36 --> 2012.70]  You got to use your common sense here.
[2012.86 --> 2013.22]  All right.
[2014.78 --> 2015.14]  Cool.
[2015.40 --> 2015.80]  All right.
[2015.80 --> 2021.26]  Why don't we why don't we talk to our sponsors and then I'll be showing you
[2021.26 --> 2022.86]  guys some pictures of my new digs.
[2022.98 --> 2023.98]  I'm pretty excited.
[2024.16 --> 2025.16]  I have never seen.
[2025.36 --> 2026.08]  Let's do it.
[2026.28 --> 2027.52]  That Luke has never seen.
[2027.60 --> 2030.82]  The show is brought to you today by Build Redux.
[2031.90 --> 2035.24]  I need to scroll down to the whole thing here.
[2035.32 --> 2035.84]  There you go.
[2035.92 --> 2039.22]  Redux is a PC builder striving to bring PC gaming to the masses.
[2039.48 --> 2042.78]  They have no markup on the parts, just a $75 build fee.
[2042.78 --> 2046.36]  So you pick your budget, pick your games, see how they're going to perform and let
[2046.36 --> 2047.94]  Redux build your PC for you.
[2048.00 --> 2051.18]  You can customize what's going inside based on the games you want to play.
[2051.42 --> 2054.36]  And Redux gives you a two year warranty on parts and labor.
[2054.78 --> 2055.32]  So don't wait.
[2055.54 --> 2058.72]  Start your build today at buildredux.com slash minus.
[2059.24 --> 2061.28]  Finally, the show is brought to you by Ridge Wallet.
[2061.34 --> 2063.74]  Stop carrying around pointless items in your pocket.
[2063.92 --> 2065.36]  Just carry your Ridge Wallet.
[2065.50 --> 2068.90]  It doesn't fit too many cards, but that's exactly the point.
[2069.00 --> 2072.58]  You don't want to have a bunch of pointless cards and everything is still easily
[2072.58 --> 2073.00]  accessible.
[2073.16 --> 2076.00]  You just press on the side and boom, all of your cards come out.
[2076.28 --> 2080.02]  It uses two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band to keep them held
[2080.02 --> 2080.70]  tightly together.
[2080.88 --> 2082.62]  And it's RFID blocking.
[2082.96 --> 2085.38]  So, well, the RFID is blocked.
[2085.86 --> 2086.96]  They offer a lifetime guarantee.
[2087.10 --> 2088.86]  It's available in aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium.
[2088.96 --> 2090.46]  And they don't just sell wallets.
[2090.54 --> 2092.84]  They've got battery banks, bags, smartphone covers, and more.
[2092.84 --> 2098.72]  So use offer code WAN to get 10% off on everythingonridge.com slash WAN.
[2098.72 --> 2100.72]  All right.
[2100.88 --> 2101.78]  So this is it.
[2102.28 --> 2103.12]  This is it.
[2103.28 --> 2104.42]  The new digs.
[2105.40 --> 2106.60]  Here we go.
[2106.76 --> 2109.58]  Should we start with like the main floor, I guess?
[2110.58 --> 2112.24]  You know what my favorite part of this is going to be?
[2112.82 --> 2114.66]  The part where you've never seen it before?
[2115.44 --> 2116.96]  Also that I can't see them.
[2117.46 --> 2120.56]  Oh, well, that's a little awkward.
[2121.40 --> 2122.10]  All right.
[2122.46 --> 2123.16]  Well, there it is.
[2123.16 --> 2125.76]  I will bring up the stream, but it will be very delayed.
[2126.06 --> 2126.28]  But yeah.
[2126.46 --> 2126.88]  All right.
[2127.16 --> 2127.46]  Yep.
[2127.68 --> 2128.72]  That makes sense.
[2129.34 --> 2130.96]  So that's the stairwell.
[2131.90 --> 2140.06]  The style is a little over the top for us.
[2142.46 --> 2149.18]  Like it's super nice, but in like a kind of old fashioned kind of way.
[2149.18 --> 2155.26]  Um, so that's pretty cool, but I will probably.
[2155.26 --> 2159.58]  There's a thing where like when, when it's, when it's decorated and done up by the person
[2159.58 --> 2163.48]  that currently lives there, like people, anyone who's like shopped for apartments or anything,
[2163.66 --> 2164.44]  done anything like that.
[2164.74 --> 2170.70]  Um, they'll know like it's your own flair on things is going to change the place a lot.
[2170.78 --> 2170.92]  Yeah.
[2170.92 --> 2172.36]  But that fireplace though.
[2173.12 --> 2173.60]  Yeah.
[2173.60 --> 2178.62]  I get a kick out of this picture frame.
[2178.80 --> 2182.14]  So you've got the picture, you got the frame around it.
[2182.24 --> 2184.68]  You got the light that shines down on the picture.
[2184.68 --> 2188.98]  And then you've got another trim that goes around the picture.
[2189.22 --> 2193.18]  And I'm kind of sitting here going, I don't own a single piece of art.
[2194.18 --> 2197.82]  Um, what do I do?
[2198.38 --> 2199.54]  What do I put there?
[2199.56 --> 2200.60]  I have no idea.
[2200.60 --> 2204.74]  There's all this, there's all this like wiring in these walls.
[2205.08 --> 2208.90]  Um, that just, I don't want a light there.
[2209.06 --> 2210.72]  What would I do with the light there?
[2211.66 --> 2215.50]  You could put your, uh, your, your, it's not your wedding photo.
[2215.86 --> 2219.30]  Um, with one with you and Yvonne on the thing.
[2219.36 --> 2220.20]  Oh, the honeymoon photo.
[2220.48 --> 2220.72]  Yeah.
[2220.92 --> 2221.18]  Yeah.
[2221.24 --> 2221.42]  Yeah.
[2221.42 --> 2221.60]  Yeah.
[2221.60 --> 2221.90]  Yeah.
[2222.34 --> 2222.70]  Yeah.
[2222.70 --> 2224.94]  I could, I could put that there.
[2225.24 --> 2227.50]  Um, I know you, yeah.
[2227.50 --> 2228.50]  I don't know, man.
[2229.02 --> 2229.92]  Uh, here's the picture.
[2229.92 --> 2231.10]  Out of the things that you have.
[2231.22 --> 2232.84]  That's the only thing I can think of.
[2233.12 --> 2233.46]  Yep.
[2233.98 --> 2235.06]  Here's a shot of the kitchen.
[2236.22 --> 2238.76]  Um, so we're probably going to refinish the floors.
[2238.92 --> 2241.16]  They're solid wood floors, which is super cool.
[2241.66 --> 2244.02]  Uh, would be extremely wasteful to take them out.
[2244.10 --> 2245.40]  So I think we don't like the color.
[2245.52 --> 2249.78]  So I think what we're going to do is we're going to sand them down and refinish them.
[2249.78 --> 2257.68]  Something a little bit, uh, cooler, uh, a little bit, um, yeah, a little bit less, a little bit lighter, lighter, maybe a little bit cooler.
[2258.32 --> 2260.72]  Uh, we're pretty, pretty overall happy.
[2260.80 --> 2261.84]  The kitchen looks pretty amazing.
[2261.96 --> 2264.92]  So many people are telling me to put a TV above the fireplace.
[2264.92 --> 2267.22]  Guys, are you doing that to trigger me?
[2268.30 --> 2271.04]  Is that why you're asking me to put a TV above my fireplace?
[2272.22 --> 2273.92]  It's the worst.
[2274.48 --> 2275.66]  I refuse.
[2276.26 --> 2277.32]  I absolutely refuse.
[2277.80 --> 2278.38]  Oh man.
[2278.64 --> 2281.78]  Brass caribou over on float plane says, I'm liking that kitchen desk.
[2281.78 --> 2283.30]  Um, okay.
[2283.40 --> 2285.04]  So that's not called a kitchen desk.
[2285.62 --> 2291.98]  Um, that space is designed for you to take phone calls and write down messages and stuff.
[2292.24 --> 2292.78]  Yeah.
[2292.90 --> 2293.92]  Remember that?
[2296.26 --> 2297.30]  Kitchen desk.
[2297.72 --> 2300.68]  There's so, so many things about this place are so like.
[2301.16 --> 2301.76]  1995.
[2302.22 --> 2303.28]  Baller nineties.
[2303.48 --> 2303.70]  Yeah.
[2304.14 --> 2304.42]  Yeah.
[2304.46 --> 2305.42]  Super baller nineties.
[2305.54 --> 2307.10]  Cause everyone had coded phones, right?
[2307.30 --> 2307.52]  Yeah.
[2307.52 --> 2310.78]  And, and you would often, someone would call your residence.
[2310.78 --> 2311.22]  Yeah.
[2311.22 --> 2313.48]  And not be able to call a specific person.
[2313.62 --> 2315.80]  So it was very often they would get the wrong person.
[2315.90 --> 2318.40]  It would be very often that that person would not be available at that time.
[2318.72 --> 2320.26]  So you wouldn't want that like desk.
[2320.46 --> 2321.90]  So you could like take call notes.
[2322.14 --> 2322.40]  Post-it notes.
[2323.36 --> 2325.68]  Um, I think it was built in 92.
[2326.42 --> 2331.14]  So that should give you some idea of the era of things.
[2331.32 --> 2335.68]  Unfortunately, that means there's no network wiring whatsoever.
[2335.68 --> 2349.36]  But Hey, at least they've got this fantastic built-in bookcase unit with this wonderful TV spot here that you can tell is totally the shape of modern TVs.
[2349.36 --> 2351.44]  So that's really convenient.
[2354.80 --> 2356.34]  Absolutely fantastic.
[2356.96 --> 2359.54]  Yeah, it is CRT-tastic.
[2359.98 --> 2366.20]  And then over here, um, this spot right here is a built-in CD storage unit.
[2366.60 --> 2371.68]  By the way, uh, another very, very specific art location.
[2371.68 --> 2373.92]  I know, right?
[2374.72 --> 2378.04]  I just don't know what to do with that stuff.
[2378.32 --> 2383.60]  It's just, ah, it actually has more than two fireplaces.
[2383.80 --> 2387.56]  There is a, uh, there's at least one more.
[2387.72 --> 2391.84]  I can't remember how many more there are because I think we're putting in one more.
[2392.84 --> 2393.98]  Um, let's see.
[2394.08 --> 2395.46]  That's so that's it for the main floor.
[2395.46 --> 2403.92]  If you guys are bored of this, I can definitely stop showing you house pictures, but, uh, if you are not bored of it, I would be happy to show you a little bit more of it.
[2404.64 --> 2407.26]  There's a good look at the downstairs here.
[2407.32 --> 2409.00]  I'm just making sure we can't see outside.
[2409.10 --> 2409.76]  Yep, there we go.
[2410.38 --> 2411.74]  There's a good shot of the downstairs.
[2411.98 --> 2413.48]  So there's a foosball table there.
[2413.74 --> 2414.40]  This is funny.
[2414.54 --> 2422.96]  Apparently this closet is specifically a little bit taller than a normal closet so that you can tuck your folding ping pong table into it.
[2422.96 --> 2426.00]  That is apparently a thing.
[2428.22 --> 2429.66]  I forgot about that.
[2429.74 --> 2430.82]  That's actually amazing.
[2431.42 --> 2433.20]  Oh my goodness, dude.
[2433.46 --> 2434.48]  So that's pretty great.
[2434.72 --> 2436.40]  There is an unfinished basement.
[2436.76 --> 2437.40]  Oh man.
[2437.52 --> 2438.88]  Most of the basement is unfinished.
[2439.56 --> 2444.04]  We're going to turn this area where the ping pong table is here into a theater room.
[2444.56 --> 2451.38]  Uh, this area here is going to be like a, a gaming area for me and my kids and my wife.
[2451.38 --> 2455.16]  I'm probably going to try to cram five PCs in here.
[2455.24 --> 2456.32]  I don't know if it'll fly.
[2456.46 --> 2458.08]  So there'll be at least three for the kids.
[2458.08 --> 2465.30]  And then my wife and I might have our machines upstairs in the office over here is going to be so cool to have a five person land area though.
[2465.54 --> 2466.66]  Like I hear you.
[2466.76 --> 2467.58]  I understand.
[2467.92 --> 2471.18]  But, but, oh, it's not as big as it looks.
[2471.44 --> 2472.84]  This is a wide shot.
[2473.30 --> 2476.26]  At least four though, because then you could do left for dead.
[2476.26 --> 2479.26]  Oh, yeah.
[2479.88 --> 2480.24]  Okay.
[2480.28 --> 2481.12]  I'll do my best.
[2481.24 --> 2482.04]  I'll do my best.
[2482.26 --> 2482.60]  Okay.
[2482.74 --> 2482.94]  Yeah.
[2482.94 --> 2483.14]  Yeah.
[2483.14 --> 2483.28]  Yeah.
[2483.28 --> 2483.38]  Yeah.
[2483.38 --> 2486.12]  It is not as big as it looks at all.
[2486.16 --> 2487.38]  That place is also pretty.
[2488.20 --> 2488.60]  Yeah.
[2489.12 --> 2493.24]  Someone could come over with like a laptop and you could just do like a temporary table.
[2493.42 --> 2493.68]  Yep.
[2493.80 --> 2494.38]  For sure.
[2494.48 --> 2494.92]  For sure.
[2495.04 --> 2501.88]  And there'll be a second, uh, or there'll be at least one other gaming machine or there'll be at least two other gaming machines in the basement.
[2501.88 --> 2515.58]  So there'll be one in the media room, obviously, and then there'll be a VR space that's over where that foosball table was, um, that will also have a TV on the wall and will obviously also be gaming capable if it's going to be where my VR setup is going to be.
[2515.92 --> 2516.28]  Right.
[2516.38 --> 2525.94]  So, uh, I'm, I'm, there's going to be a lot of content coming over the next little bit here, guys, because the place is, is going to need a real tech makeover.
[2526.08 --> 2528.74]  I don't think I'm going to do all of the stuff myself this time though.
[2528.74 --> 2539.72]  So I spent, I mean, it took me 10 years to get my current house to the state where I'm really happy with the technology situation with my server closet, with my wifi access points everywhere.
[2539.84 --> 2540.62]  I need them to be.
[2540.96 --> 2545.58]  Everything's hard line cat six a like this place is perfect.
[2545.82 --> 2552.32]  I've got all of my base stations, my lighthouses for my VR and the living room, uh, all wired up through the ceiling.
[2552.32 --> 2562.08]  So none of the cables are running down the wall or anything like that, but it took me, it's not often I get home at the end of the day after work and I feel like crawling around in my crawl space.
[2562.30 --> 2563.16]  You know what I mean?
[2563.64 --> 2570.60]  Like, I, I think I'm, I think I'm going to let a professional come in and do the cat six day this time instead of doing it myself.
[2570.60 --> 2576.46]  Um, yeah, I, a bunch of people in flow plane chat were asking for moving vlogs.
[2576.60 --> 2579.14]  I, I can, I guess you can speak to this.
[2579.20 --> 2585.30]  I don't suspect there will be moving blogs, but, but no, like what you just said, I'm sure there will be like tech upgrade.
[2585.44 --> 2588.36]  There will be content around the house anyways.
[2588.36 --> 2591.24]  So the, uh, people are asking to see the mechanical room.
[2591.42 --> 2593.62]  So like the, the boiler and furnace and stuff.
[2593.80 --> 2595.90]  So, uh, it doesn't have a furnace.
[2595.90 --> 2599.32]  It has in floor, uh, radiant heat, which is sweet.
[2599.32 --> 2608.18]  And get this, I don't even have to hire someone to do the check of it because Jake got Fleer to send us that like $30,000 thermal camera.
[2608.32 --> 2609.54]  So I'm just doing it myself.
[2610.54 --> 2616.52]  So you just turn the heat up across the whole house and then you just walk around with your thermal camera and make sure that there's no dead spots.
[2616.74 --> 2617.10]  Yeah.
[2617.12 --> 2617.50]  Pretty cool.
[2617.50 --> 2620.96]  Uh, anyway, here's the, the mechanical room is crazy.
[2621.48 --> 2622.68]  It's huge.
[2622.84 --> 2625.08]  This room really is as big as it looks.
[2625.22 --> 2629.64]  And the reason for it is that they had intended to put in a pool and they never did it.
[2629.76 --> 2634.48]  And they had wanted all the pool equipment in this room and it never went in.
[2634.86 --> 2641.70]  So, uh, it doesn't have a continuous water heater like we put in our current house, but it does have two hot water tanks.
[2642.66 --> 2646.70]  So you should basically never run out, which I thought was pretty funny.
[2646.70 --> 2655.04]  That is a very, um, 90s continuous heaters don't exist yet, or they are too expensive solution to that.
[2655.04 --> 2659.42]  And there is absolutely no ethernet in this place whatsoever.
[2659.42 --> 2663.14]  So I'm going to need that.
[2663.38 --> 2666.10]  Uh, TELUS says fiber is available to the address though.
[2666.44 --> 2667.26]  So that's good.
[2668.34 --> 2671.52]  So someone in chat, uh, said, where's Luke's room?
[2671.52 --> 2673.86]  And then someone responded, this looks like Luke's room.
[2674.14 --> 2674.48]  Nice.
[2674.92 --> 2675.42]  I dig it.
[2675.68 --> 2677.34]  Here, this can be, this can be Luke's room.
[2677.48 --> 2677.68]  JK.
[2677.80 --> 2679.26]  This is the master bedroom.
[2679.76 --> 2680.60]  Pretty simple.
[2680.86 --> 2684.80]  You know, a lot of the places we went and looked at had crazy master bedrooms.
[2684.80 --> 2688.28]  Like there's this weird sitting area in it.
[2688.28 --> 2691.38]  And like, I'm kind of sitting here going, who sits in their bedroom?
[2692.28 --> 2694.16]  Like, that is so weird.
[2694.36 --> 2698.16]  Or they would have like a balcony that opens out in front of the house.
[2698.52 --> 2702.30]  And I'm sitting here going, they'd have like a, and it would be staged by the realtor or whatever.
[2702.30 --> 2706.78]  And they would have a little, they'd have like a little table for sitting and having tea or what.
[2706.78 --> 2708.92]  I'm sitting here going, who would do that?
[2709.10 --> 2709.62]  In your room.
[2709.74 --> 2709.94]  Yeah.
[2709.96 --> 2711.34]  Why would you do that in your room?
[2712.02 --> 2716.14]  Unless you have like literally a servant, but like that's, you know.
[2716.32 --> 2722.40]  Cause it's always, it's always places, um, where you would see this stuff that are enormous, right?
[2722.46 --> 2725.24]  And have a gorgeous backyard and patio.
[2725.24 --> 2734.34]  So I'm sitting here going, why on earth would I be sitting, sitting on the front of the top of the front of my house when I could just be in my backyard where I have privacy.
[2735.58 --> 2735.86]  Obviously.
[2735.86 --> 2739.20]  Yes, I would like to observe the cul-de-sac or wherever it is.
[2739.20 --> 2739.48]  Yeah.
[2739.48 --> 2740.10]  Or whatever.
[2741.00 --> 2744.68]  I need to, I need to observe every car that drives down my street perfectly.
[2745.52 --> 2754.24]  Um, I think that's pretty much it for the pictures that I can show without showing any of the exterior.
[2754.24 --> 2758.72]  And that's my goal is to not show the exterior of this house at all.
[2759.40 --> 2771.08]  Um, something that we, something that we did to make things a little bit, um, more challenging is a thing I'm just actually not going to talk about just to make my life, my life easier.
[2771.08 --> 2776.58]  So I get to go pick up the keys in 20 minutes, which means we better get through some more tech topics.
[2776.68 --> 2779.02]  Otherwise we're going to have had a one topic show.
[2779.70 --> 2782.80]  So thanks for, thanks for looking at house pictures.
[2783.08 --> 2786.14]  Oh, people are asking all kinds of things here.
[2786.56 --> 2787.92]  Uh, it's so obvious.
[2787.92 --> 2791.48]  You don't have servants says new master 96.
[2791.88 --> 2795.38]  Um, yes, I do not have servants.
[2796.60 --> 2797.08]  Yes.
[2797.08 --> 2798.10]  It has air conditioning.
[2798.10 --> 2801.06]  I actually like the air conditioning at my current place better.
[2801.06 --> 2802.98]  Not just because I, and I did it.
[2803.58 --> 2808.28]  Um, but because it's, uh, it's room by room at our current place.
[2808.28 --> 2809.46]  Cause we did it with mini splits.
[2809.66 --> 2812.24]  Whereas at the new place, it's just one big unit.
[2812.24 --> 2817.76]  So you're gonna, you're gonna have rooms that are hotter and you're gonna have rooms that are not as hot.
[2817.76 --> 2819.48]  And that just is kind of annoying.
[2820.92 --> 2824.60]  Um, someone says, looks like the roof needs to be redone.
[2824.68 --> 2826.52]  Uh, the roof does need to be redone.
[2826.62 --> 2830.48]  It's going to cost like a hundred grand or something like that.
[2830.48 --> 2834.18]  But we're putting, we're putting in solar though and stuff.
[2834.52 --> 2835.06]  Oh, that's cool.
[2835.20 --> 2838.84]  There's a reason we're going like super sustainable, like forever.
[2838.94 --> 2840.08]  Are you getting power walls?
[2840.78 --> 2843.60]  Um, I don't think power walls here yet.
[2844.46 --> 2845.98]  There's, there's solar roofing stuff.
[2845.98 --> 2846.68]  Isn't here yet.
[2846.92 --> 2848.08]  So I don't know.
[2848.14 --> 2849.58]  I haven't actually looked into that.
[2851.04 --> 2851.48]  Yep.
[2852.08 --> 2853.34]  Tech topic, tech topic.
[2853.76 --> 2855.38]  Or are we still doing house questions?
[2856.88 --> 2859.20]  Um, yeah, let's do a tech topic for sure.
[2859.38 --> 2859.76]  Heck yeah.
[2860.48 --> 2866.02]  Former Microsoft employees stole $10 million in, uh, in Xbox gifts cards.
[2866.26 --> 2866.68]  Amazing.
[2867.34 --> 2869.68]  I'm going to butcher this name, but I'm going to try it.
[2869.92 --> 2875.66]  Volodymyr Kvasik was working at Microsoft's Redmond office testing e-commerce infrastructure.
[2876.18 --> 2877.24]  Uh, he's 26 year olds.
[2877.34 --> 2878.32]  I don't know why this matters.
[2878.48 --> 2882.52]  Uh, he quickly discovered a flaw in the system, uh, that he then exploited it.
[2882.52 --> 2883.50]  He did not report it.
[2883.74 --> 2884.48]  He exploited it.
[2884.48 --> 2885.68]  He started small.
[2885.68 --> 2890.02]  Uh, he, he started off with 10 to a hundred dollar codes.
[2890.40 --> 2894.10]  Um, he didn't generate really all that many, but he was, he was scalping them.
[2894.18 --> 2894.80]  He was selling them.
[2895.18 --> 2901.76]  Two years later, only two years later, uh, he had generated over 152,000 gift codes at
[2901.76 --> 2904.22]  a valuation of $10.1 million.
[2904.76 --> 2910.64]  He flipped those cards, uh, for Bitcoin and then flipped that Bitcoin for cash and was
[2910.64 --> 2914.52]  very quickly living on a seven figure lakefront home.
[2914.52 --> 2920.76]  Um, I don't know how you could possibly think you weren't going to get caught for that.
[2920.76 --> 2927.16]  Um, but I suspect just like after a while of not getting caught, he just thinks he's
[2927.16 --> 2930.16]  invincible and then buys a seven figure lakefront home.
[2930.48 --> 2931.30]  I guess so.
[2932.00 --> 2933.60]  I mean, hubris, right?
[2934.38 --> 2935.86]  That is some classic hubris.
[2936.90 --> 2939.34]  Nine years in prison for gift card theft.
[2939.44 --> 2942.52]  I mean, it was $10 million of gift card theft.
[2942.52 --> 2944.76]  He effectively stole $10 million.
[2945.36 --> 2945.54]  Yeah.
[2945.74 --> 2947.22]  That is crazy.
[2947.50 --> 2949.38]  Apparently he was responsible.
[2949.82 --> 2951.50]  Um, I don't see where this is.
[2951.62 --> 2951.82]  Yeah.
[2951.96 --> 2957.36]  He, he flipped so many cards, 152,000 cards that were just generated of thin air.
[2957.36 --> 2957.62]  Right.
[2957.62 --> 2963.36]  So he was responsible for global fluctuations in the price of Xbox gift cards on reseller
[2963.36 --> 2965.82]  markets because he flooded them so hard.
[2967.42 --> 2968.06]  Holy.
[2969.38 --> 2970.50]  Absolutely crazy.
[2971.30 --> 2971.88]  That's nuts.
[2971.88 --> 2974.84]  That is unfreaking real, man.
[2975.92 --> 2977.70]  Oh, what can you do about it though?
[2977.76 --> 2977.98]  Right.
[2979.66 --> 2980.72]  Uh, yeah.
[2980.88 --> 2986.10]  I mean, the second it goes into Bitcoin, it's, it's, uh, it's a little difficult to track.
[2986.10 --> 2988.86]  I do wonder how exactly he was caught.
[2989.38 --> 2994.32]  Um, I don't know if like one of his, uh, fellow employees comes and visits his home and
[2994.32 --> 2997.94]  is like, how'd you get this?
[2997.94 --> 2998.38]  Yeah.
[2998.38 --> 2998.50]  Yeah.
[2998.50 --> 2998.94]  Yeah.
[2998.94 --> 2999.26]  Yeah.
[2999.26 --> 3000.06]  Pretty crazy.
[3001.68 --> 3002.56]  Pretty crazy.
[3002.56 --> 3005.94]  All right.
[3005.94 --> 3008.26]  I am getting a call from the wife.
[3008.26 --> 3012.64]  So I think I'm going to have to go pretty soon, but why don't we try and get through a couple
[3012.64 --> 3013.72]  more topics here.
[3013.72 --> 3018.84]  Uh, Intel and Apple are going to be the first to get three nanometer from TSMC.
[3018.84 --> 3023.22]  Uh, they are both lined up as the first customers for the new process, which will be referred
[3023.22 --> 3026.20]  to as N3 and will be deployed in late 2022.
[3026.72 --> 3032.24]  It'll offer a 10 to 15% performance increase at the same power and transistor count, a 30%
[3032.24 --> 3037.52]  power reduction at the same clocks and complexity, as well as 70 and 20% gains in logic density
[3037.52 --> 3039.94]  and SRAM density respectively.
[3040.52 --> 3044.48]  According to a Nikkei report, both companies are already testing their chip designs that
[3044.48 --> 3046.20]  are being produced using the N3 process.
[3046.20 --> 3051.08]  And it also states Intel is apparently preparing at least two products to be made with the process,
[3051.18 --> 3053.32]  one for notebooks and one for servers.
[3053.56 --> 3054.34]  It's possible.
[3054.44 --> 3058.88]  These will only be more niche products as opposed to Intel's mainstream consumer products, but
[3058.88 --> 3060.10]  only time will tell.
[3060.10 --> 3067.12]  Apple will be using, uh, N3 on an SOC in late 2022 or early 2023 in the iPad.
[3067.54 --> 3073.66]  And apparently that will be a new processor, uh, versus the current M1, which kind of makes
[3073.66 --> 3078.94]  sense because M1 will have had, well, it'll be two years, at least two years old by that
[3078.94 --> 3079.22]  time.
[3079.74 --> 3084.42]  We know that Intel will be outsourcing some Atom and Xeon based SOCs to TSMC.
[3084.52 --> 3087.74]  So it's a safe bet that, uh, these are among those products.
[3089.24 --> 3089.60]  Fascinating.
[3090.24 --> 3093.80]  I have one more quick thing to announce on LTT store.
[3094.70 --> 3096.06]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[3096.36 --> 3096.56]  Ooh.
[3097.24 --> 3099.02]  We have a new product.
[3099.02 --> 3101.32]  Oh yeah.
[3101.70 --> 3103.84]  Reflective heatsink shirt is here.
[3103.84 --> 3108.68]  Ladies and gentlemen, look at this fantastic modeling team we've got.
[3108.76 --> 3109.22]  That's right.
[3109.28 --> 3113.06]  It's reflective has a reflective LTT logo on the back.
[3113.10 --> 3113.74]  Look at this guy.
[3113.86 --> 3114.60]  Look at this girl.
[3114.76 --> 3115.52]  Look at this guy.
[3115.62 --> 3116.44]  Look at this other guy.
[3116.54 --> 3119.32]  Hey, and you can get them now for $19.99.
[3119.54 --> 3122.96]  Also, we have brought back mystery shirts.
[3123.80 --> 3126.62]  They're $12.99 and they're a mystery.
[3126.62 --> 3131.84]  A lot of them are going to be older and less popular ones or ones that are, we only had
[3131.84 --> 3134.04]  oddball sizes left and good stuff like that.
[3134.16 --> 3135.90]  So, hey, there you go.
[3136.04 --> 3137.96]  They're a mystery, but they're cheaper.
[3138.32 --> 3140.50]  And I think that's pretty much it for the show.
[3140.60 --> 3142.18]  I think I got to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[3142.34 --> 3144.34]  So I'll just do a couple of super chats here.
[3145.46 --> 3146.36]  Oh my goodness.
[3146.44 --> 3150.06]  There's quite a few, but at least I managed to click the tab so they didn't all go away.
[3151.52 --> 3154.34]  Adrian Frick recommends a game, The Messenger.
[3154.34 --> 3156.66]  I'm not looking for more games right now, though.
[3156.74 --> 3159.60]  I got a bunch of them last week.
[3160.40 --> 3161.52]  Thanks, Bob Costco.
[3162.74 --> 3163.78]  Anyone else notice?
[3164.24 --> 3167.30]  Little Linus and Luke's beards disappear going from the intro to the sponsor.
[3167.64 --> 3169.60]  Yes, that's because the sponsor things are older.
[3170.70 --> 3172.62]  Michael says, thanks for all the content.
[3172.74 --> 3173.70]  Love watching the videos.
[3174.14 --> 3174.96]  Hey, awesome.
[3176.52 --> 3179.60]  Robert says, Windows 11 system requirements are a mess.
[3179.66 --> 3181.28]  Hard to keep up with the leaks and discussions.
[3181.56 --> 3183.10]  And their own tool is still not for users.
[3183.10 --> 3184.06]  Yeah, 100%.
[3184.06 --> 3186.92]  The good news is that it's not actually launched yet.
[3187.02 --> 3188.86]  So they've got time to get this stuff figured out.
[3189.48 --> 3189.56]  Yeah.
[3190.64 --> 3194.08]  Hunter says, the TPM 2.0 requirement is going to put a strain on schools.
[3194.28 --> 3198.22]  I can tell you for a fact my district can't afford slash doesn't want to pay for new positions.
[3199.64 --> 3202.86]  Yeah, that's actually a really, really good point.
[3203.56 --> 3205.38]  They do have quite a few years.
[3205.38 --> 3210.84]  But I do know that a lot of schools try to stay on the most modern operating system at the very least.
[3211.44 --> 3212.78]  So that will make that tough.
[3213.56 --> 3218.14]  Tomek says, live streams don't work in the float plane app I built for web OS TVs.
[3218.38 --> 3220.08]  I'm going to fix it and test next week.
[3220.78 --> 3221.12]  Sweet.
[3221.26 --> 3222.30]  A web OS app.
[3222.60 --> 3223.64]  That's pretty cool.
[3224.28 --> 3224.90]  That's very cool.
[3224.98 --> 3227.14]  Yeah, I'm an LG TV guy myself.
[3227.14 --> 3231.22]  So unfortunately, most of the time anyone's live streaming on float plane, it's me.
[3231.38 --> 3233.98]  So there's no point in me watching it on my web OS TV.
[3234.10 --> 3235.00]  But that's fantastic.
[3237.20 --> 3238.94]  With that, I think you probably have to go.
[3240.90 --> 3241.26]  Yes.
[3241.42 --> 3243.52]  Let me just see if there's...
[3243.52 --> 3245.58]  I know you're going to want to get sucked into that.
[3245.66 --> 3246.26]  I'm just trying to...
[3246.26 --> 3247.94]  Christian says, look into smart vents.
[3248.06 --> 3249.44]  They open and close based on room temperature.
[3249.56 --> 3251.56]  Yeah, I've heard some of them aren't very good though.
[3251.62 --> 3252.88]  So I'll have to have a look at that.
[3252.88 --> 3258.74]  And Lyon says, if you reach out to Elon Musk, I bet you could get not only their solar roof,
[3258.80 --> 3259.72]  but also the power wall.
[3259.88 --> 3260.52]  I don't know.
[3260.60 --> 3261.44]  I kind of doubt it.
[3261.54 --> 3261.90]  I don't...
[3261.90 --> 3263.38]  We're not exactly on a first name basis.
[3263.62 --> 3264.92]  I don't think he cares.
[3268.34 --> 3272.58]  Josh says, hey, a couple of WAN shows ago, you read a super chat I sent.
[3272.70 --> 3275.56]  I didn't really expect you to read it, let alone genuinely take it seriously.
[3275.66 --> 3276.20]  It made my day.
[3276.24 --> 3276.80]  So thanks for that.
[3276.86 --> 3277.86]  Hey, you're welcome, Josh.
[3278.40 --> 3278.86]  All right.
[3279.06 --> 3279.70]  Thanks, everyone.
[3280.10 --> 3281.20]  We'll see you again next week.
[3281.20 --> 3282.16]  Same bad time.
[3282.16 --> 3283.86]  Same bad channel.
[3284.56 --> 3284.84]  Bye.
[3286.78 --> 3287.18]  Oops.
[3287.44 --> 3287.80]  Uh-oh.
[3288.06 --> 3288.30]  Whoops.
[3288.66 --> 3289.74]  I need the...
[3289.74 --> 3291.00]  There we go.
