[0.00 → 12.42] And we are live. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the one and only WAN show where Luke has finally cleaned up his image, and I am looking homeless.
[13.04 → 19.72] I have gotten as much worse as Luke has gotten better since last week's show.
[20.64 → 23.08] There had to be balance in the universe.
[23.08 → 29.72] I have an explanation for that which also has a lot to do with why the show is spectacularly late today.
[30.00 → 32.40] I was busy house painting.
[32.64 → 32.90] Okay.
[33.26 → 37.68] I have decided that YouTube, YouTube is not the life for me anymore.
[37.68 → 40.04] And I want to go back to painting houses.
[40.44 → 42.06] Gotta go back to university painters.
[42.40 → 42.78] Yeah.
[42.82 → 49.36] What actually happened is that word got out that I did some painting for Dennis on the weekend.
[49.36 → 54.00] So this was during Dennis's Intel Extreme Tech upgrade.
[54.14 → 54.42] Okay.
[54.82 → 56.10] Because I talked about that.
[56.10 → 64.62] So he fed me pad thai and actually both of us, Yvonne and I went and painted a couple walls in his house, like accent colours.
[64.62 → 71.04] And he was very pleased with that arrangement, which makes sense because Dennis is a spectacularly cheap individual.
[71.04 → 77.08] But the thing is that, you know, Dennis has actually done a lot for me over the years as well.
[77.08 → 85.26] Like, you know, taking me into his home in Taiwan and showing me around the city, like totally off hours and stuff like that.
[85.32 → 89.38] So from my point of view, it was just like, this is like doing a favour for a friend.
[89.48 → 94.64] This is not like, uh, I actually will paint your house for noodles sort of thing.
[94.64 → 101.88] Um, anyway, anyway, word got out that I will paint people's houses for noodles.
[102.16 → 114.96] And one of our employees, uh, Andy got it in his head that during his Intel Extreme Tech upgrade, instead of having me build a computer, since he knows how to build a computer,
[114.96 → 121.02] he will build the computer and Linus should just paint his room.
[122.70 → 125.72] So we shot Andy's Extreme Tech upgrade.
[125.94 → 133.16] And he tells me, uh, yesterday, he's like, Hey, make sure you bring your painting supplies to Intel Extreme Tech upgrade.
[133.46 → 140.50] So I spent the day painting Andy's house, which is why I'm, uh, this is why I'm dressed like this.
[142.36 → 144.64] Got my, got my paint shorts on here.
[144.96 → 145.46] Nice.
[145.46 → 147.54] And mounting a TV to his wall.
[148.60 → 152.44] And, uh, Andy was the one who actually built the gaming rig.
[153.30 → 157.00] Guys, don't miss this one, though, because if you think...
[157.00 → 157.62] I'm actually, yeah, I'm stoked.
[157.78 → 158.06] If you think...
[158.06 → 159.16] I've liked all of them so far.
[159.30 → 159.94] They've been great.
[160.28 → 164.46] And if you think Andy got a great deal, let me tell you something.
[164.74 → 170.14] I definitely got him back because at the end of the video, I straight up break his bed.
[170.14 → 175.38] Like, I'm not talking like I damage it a little bit.
[175.72 → 182.46] I'm talking like, like, like two of the beams that make up the bed are now shattered.
[184.52 → 185.86] Completely destroyed.
[186.50 → 187.62] I don't even know.
[187.78 → 188.36] I don't want to know.
[188.36 → 189.18] No, no.
[189.28 → 189.72] You know what?
[189.78 → 192.08] I will tell you because this video has enough.
[192.22 → 195.50] It's, it's great enough that, and the moment, it won't spoil the moment.
[195.60 → 197.32] The moment is an, is an instant classic.
[197.50 → 202.30] So his setup is probably the weirdest one out of everything we've done so far.
[202.30 → 206.48] He's got like this basement, and he wanted to make a man cave.
[206.72 → 219.78] But the thing about Andy is he's like all about that FPS and that like colour accuracy and not so much about like his setup making any sense to anyone other than him.
[220.32 → 229.20] So he's got this, we painted the walls, this like 50% gray because it's all about like he wants it to be as colour accurate as possible.
[229.20 → 238.14] And then we put this like colour accurate 6,500 Kelvin bias lighting strip behind the TV to bounce off the gray wall.
[238.34 → 241.22] And then he's got this like special BenQ desk lamp.
[241.36 → 244.90] That's like exactly 6,500 Kelvin, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[244.98 → 247.42] Anyway, the point is he's got this wall mounted TV, right?
[247.78 → 249.86] And then he's got a bed in front of it.
[250.36 → 257.92] And then like right in front of the TV and then behind the bed, he's got a desk and a chair.
[257.92 → 263.92] And like the idea, he's like, yeah, so like I'll be like playing video games here.
[264.08 → 267.04] And then my wife could like to watch a movie on the couch on the TV.
[267.10 → 268.56] I'm like, what?
[269.12 → 270.50] What are you talking about?
[270.54 → 271.62] Anyway, the point is whatever.
[271.70 → 273.26] It makes him happy.
[273.38 → 274.82] And that makes me happy.
[274.82 → 289.30] Anyway, the point is he blew all his money on like a 65 inch OLED and like an RTX 3080.
[289.44 → 296.76] Like he went all out, reused a bunch of his old components because he blew all of his budget on this TV and graphics card.
[296.76 → 301.86] And then like there isn't even it's just like a bare concrete floor in the room.
[301.96 → 311.06] So it's like still completely like unfinished basement, except for we painted these two walls and there's like this weird bed in the room.
[311.20 → 311.46] Whatever.
[311.64 → 313.50] It's its something.
[314.22 → 317.76] And so anyway, I was like, OK, so that's what you imagine.
[317.92 → 323.88] Ariel is going to be like chilling in the bed or something, watching TV and you're gaming.
[323.88 → 326.60] So anyway, he's like gaming, but he's actually using the TV.
[326.68 → 332.86] I'm like, OK, I'm going to like I'm going to I'm going to watch you play racing games because he's like perfect at racing games, like go karting.
[333.00 → 340.48] We did a go karting event back in the before four times before you could before COVID and you could actually do like work functions.
[340.92 → 346.58] Anyway, we did a thing, and he like him and Alex Clark just like destroyed everyone.
[346.70 → 348.16] It was an it was a nightmare.
[348.16 → 348.70] It makes sense.
[348.82 → 350.88] Nightmare for the rest of us.
[350.98 → 353.32] Those two and Jake is what I would expect to destroy.
[353.32 → 357.48] Where we like to be good at things and then other people show up and are way better than us.
[357.50 → 358.26] And it's a bad time.
[358.34 → 359.64] You know, it was one of those kinds of things.
[359.66 → 362.12] Anyway, the point is, I'm like, OK, I'm going to watch you play video games.
[362.26 → 369.44] So I like jump into the bed and land on the floor like I go right through the bed.
[373.04 → 376.66] Oh, that's some that's some classic Ikea quality right there.
[376.66 → 381.50] An interesting part of this story for me is you're you're not the person to do that.
[382.24 → 384.80] Like you don't exactly weigh a ton.
[384.94 → 390.24] No, I write like that doesn't really line up for me.
[390.36 → 395.06] Like the fact that you jumped on something that has four legs, and it collapsed is like it.
[395.06 → 397.72] It broke hard.
[398.02 → 399.34] Like there's footage.
[399.40 → 399.90] There's footage.
[400.02 → 404.66] I'm so glad David was rolling because there was terrible.
[405.00 → 406.92] There was one moment in the video.
[407.00 → 408.56] Unfortunately, we weren't rolling on.
[408.94 → 413.34] I was like trying to adjust his NATO leaf like RGB wall things.
[413.90 → 415.84] And there was like six of them in a thing.
[415.88 → 418.52] And I was kind of trying to like I was trying to rotate them all.
[418.60 → 420.28] And they were all stuck on with double-sided tape.
[420.28 → 424.62] I knew it was a bit of a gamble, but I was like trying to rotate them like two degrees,
[425.04 → 426.52] you know, like just a little bit.
[426.92 → 429.98] And then they all detached at the same time, like started falling down.
[430.08 → 432.90] I'm like, ah, no, David wasn't rolling for that one.
[433.02 → 435.58] But he was rolling for the bed collapse.
[435.64 → 437.66] And I'm so glad every once in a while, guys,
[437.76 → 440.00] stuff happens while we're doing these kinds of projects.
[440.00 → 441.86] And the camera's like not rolling.
[441.92 → 445.34] And I'm just like, no, that was like, that was primo.
[445.60 → 447.44] It was primo content.
[447.84 → 449.28] Ah, primo.
[450.28 → 453.66] Okay, we've got a great show for you guys today.
[453.94 → 455.60] What are our main topics?
[457.10 → 460.96] Intel, consulting benchmarks in N1 versus core ISO.
[461.06 → 461.60] Can I what, sir?
[461.62 → 465.06] Okay, is this the thing that you were talking about before the show
[465.06 → 468.42] to do with another influencer or something?
[468.62 → 470.96] Okay, let's super excited about this topic,
[470.96 → 474.10] but not even like anything to do with the title that I just said.
[474.42 → 474.72] Okay.
[475.30 → 476.16] We'll get to that.
[476.38 → 477.48] Lord, what else we got, Luke?
[477.48 → 480.96] CD Project Red source code sold.
[481.34 → 486.36] Maybe we'll get into the maybe later for millions in a dark web auction.
[486.98 → 487.44] Wow.
[487.54 → 488.34] Oh, my.
[488.54 → 488.86] Maybe.
[489.40 → 491.02] Well, yeah, we'll get into that.
[491.14 → 491.70] Okay.
[493.04 → 494.44] What else we got here?
[494.50 → 494.80] Oh, yeah.
[494.80 → 496.32] There's the headline topic.
[496.32 → 499.62] Wait, where the devil is that topic?
[499.70 → 500.66] What page is that on?
[503.66 → 505.74] Oh, the return of Pascal.
[506.52 → 507.46] That's right.
[508.14 → 512.64] Supply is so short for new generation graphics cards
[512.64 → 519.02] that NVIDIA is supposedly starting up production again of Pascal graphics cards.
[519.02 → 523.64] So that is like what we're on Turing and then there was Volta.
[523.88 → 526.80] And then there was what am I missing here?
[528.24 → 529.14] Hold on a second.
[529.26 → 529.76] What was?
[531.12 → 531.88] No, hold on.
[531.94 → 532.28] Hold on.
[532.48 → 533.64] Ampere run Ampere.
[533.84 → 535.08] Then there was going back.
[535.16 → 535.80] There was Turing.
[535.94 → 537.88] Then there was Volta in there somewhere.
[537.88 → 539.24] And then Pascal.
[539.48 → 542.12] That's like three generations ago.
[542.32 → 543.94] So we'll talk a bit more about that.
[544.14 → 548.78] And finally, Twitter is exploring a potential subscription model
[548.78 → 551.26] to ease its dependence on ad revenue.
[551.48 → 552.32] That's fascinating.
[552.48 → 552.94] You know what?
[553.14 → 555.50] David and I were talking about that just today
[555.50 → 557.78] while we were working on Andy's extreme tech upgrade.
[558.08 → 562.40] So I can share some of the thoughts that he and I both had during that conversation.
[562.52 → 563.62] Let's roll that intro.
[563.62 → 568.96] That's not what the intro music sounds like.
[582.24 → 583.10] Oh, man.
[583.26 → 585.02] I guess people probably heard that.
[585.14 → 586.62] I just got Rick rolled, man.
[587.18 → 588.48] I just got Rick rolled.
[589.32 → 590.64] Oh, that's brutal.
[590.76 → 591.50] Did you not?
[591.62 → 592.70] Oh, I guess you couldn't hear that
[592.70 → 593.88] because you're probably not listening to the stream.
[593.98 → 594.10] Okay.
[594.16 → 596.34] The show is brought to you today by Sea sonic,
[596.94 → 599.68] Private Internet Access, and Back blaze.
[600.12 → 602.58] Float plane chat is probably going to be...
[602.58 → 605.08] It's blowing up.
[606.38 → 607.30] Oh, no.
[607.50 → 608.64] I clicked it.
[608.84 → 610.24] What did you click on?
[610.48 → 610.96] No.
[611.46 → 612.96] I don't want to say it.
[613.68 → 614.82] I'll just say it.
[615.48 → 618.84] Apparently, someone bought LTTporn.com.
[618.84 → 620.34] And I clicked it.
[620.40 → 622.40] I was like, okay, you've got to be kidding me.
[622.46 → 623.22] What is this?
[624.02 → 624.88] I clicked it.
[624.98 → 625.60] I clicked it.
[626.26 → 627.32] Oh, my goodness.
[628.66 → 629.48] Of course.
[629.94 → 630.62] Oh, man.
[630.84 → 631.48] Of course.
[631.72 → 632.36] I just...
[632.36 → 633.48] I knew it was going to be...
[633.48 → 635.48] I thought it was going to be an LTT store redirect
[635.48 → 638.76] because that's usually what it is when the community buys something.
[639.18 → 639.86] Oh, my God.
[639.86 → 642.72] There's like pages and pages of float plane chat.
[642.86 → 643.86] It's like...
[643.86 → 645.92] Got him.
[647.38 → 649.16] Oh, I can't believe I just clicked that.
[649.26 → 650.96] I got Rick rolled in 2021.
[651.36 → 651.64] All right.
[651.98 → 654.34] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic here?
[654.38 → 656.12] It's actually not the meatiest one,
[656.28 → 658.86] but it was what I thought was the most interesting headline.
[659.02 → 659.46] So, let's do it.
[659.50 → 660.86] This is according to Tech Yes City.
[661.36 → 667.86] NVIDIA is supposedly starting up production again of GP107 GPUs.
[667.86 → 672.52] So, this is the GPU found in the GTX 1050 Ti.
[672.72 → 676.02] And it makes sense because NVIDIA for a long time now
[676.02 → 680.02] has launched their new architectures top to bottom.
[680.18 → 684.38] So, they've led with the highest margin, highest selling price SKUs.
[684.82 → 687.32] And the thing is that when we're talking about, you know,
[687.44 → 690.62] a GPU that's produced on a new manufacturing process,
[690.72 → 691.78] so like on a new node.
[692.22 → 693.92] In this case, these are...
[693.92 → 694.46] What are they?
[694.56 → 697.08] Samsung's 12 nanometre, if I recall correctly.
[697.08 → 698.90] No, no, 8 nanometers or whatever.
[699.78 → 703.04] Samsung, however many nanometers.
[703.50 → 704.62] You'll have to pardon me.
[704.74 → 705.12] I just...
[705.12 → 708.18] I can only keep so many things in my brain at a time.
[708.44 → 709.02] 10 nanometre.
[709.54 → 710.86] Thank you, Google.
[711.28 → 713.08] So, Samsung's 10 nanometre...
[713.68 → 713.98] Wait.
[714.94 → 715.84] Ampere is...
[715.84 → 716.90] Wait, did I just search for Turing?
[717.30 → 717.70] Ampere.
[717.84 → 718.52] I think it's 8.
[718.92 → 719.60] I thought it was 8.
[720.16 → 720.60] It is 8.
[720.70 → 721.38] Oh, perfect.
[721.48 → 721.94] Okay, Ampere.
[721.94 → 723.84] So, here's the thing.
[724.98 → 727.76] When you're making like a GA...
[727.76 → 728.06] What is it?
[728.12 → 730.32] GA 100 or GA 101, 102.
[730.68 → 735.80] I think it's GA 102, which would be what you find in an RTX 3080 or a 3090.
[736.50 → 737.40] GA 102 GPU.
[737.56 → 739.28] I'm just going to double-check these things.
[740.16 → 742.26] GA 102, blah, blah, blah.
[742.60 → 743.92] Ampere, blah, blah, blah.
[744.04 → 744.52] GA 102.
[744.78 → 746.82] It doesn't say what graphics cards it's found in.
[747.28 → 749.16] 3080, 3090.
[749.16 → 750.02] Yeah, okay, cool.
[750.36 → 751.18] So, a GA 102.
[751.82 → 753.82] Basically, you've got this wafer, okay?
[754.02 → 760.34] So, it's a circle-shaped silicon wafer, and then you've got this GPU that's, you know, let's say this big or whatever.
[760.58 → 761.16] And you've got to go...
[761.98 → 766.40] You can only create so many of them out of each wafer.
[767.32 → 767.58] Okay.
[767.96 → 772.38] So, the limitation, what keeps you from making a larger and larger chip is,
[772.38 → 779.56] A, getting the timing right for the signals within the chip once it starts getting physically large can be very challenging.
[779.92 → 785.38] And then, number two, on that silicon wafer, you're going to have some percentage of...
[786.16 → 788.28] Or you're going to have some incidence of, like, defects.
[788.48 → 791.52] So, you could have, like, a defect here and a defect here and there and there.
[791.74 → 796.12] And, you know, sometimes that's going to be like, oh, we've got a defect right in the middle of these CUBA cores.
[796.12 → 797.48] Well, that's fine.
[797.76 → 801.24] Let's just turn this into a SKU that has fewer CUBA cores.
[801.44 → 806.96] So, for example, an RTX 3090 has more than an RTX 3080.
[807.06 → 808.88] So, you could, like, turn some of them off if they're defective.
[808.94 → 812.00] Now, it's a 3080 instead of being a 3090 or whatever the case may be.
[812.06 → 813.30] So, you've got these defects, right?
[814.18 → 818.82] And the way that it works is, in order to make a cheaper GPU, you have smaller dies.
[818.92 → 823.32] So, you have, like, fewer CUBA cores, but you can make more of them.
[823.66 → 823.86] Okay.
[823.86 → 823.94] Okay.
[824.60 → 826.56] So, here's the problem.
[827.08 → 828.72] NVIDIA could roll out.
[828.80 → 837.72] I'm sure that they have, you know, 50 class GPUs designed with their Ampere architecture.
[837.84 → 840.68] But the problem is that if they can't get enough of these wafers,
[841.06 → 844.98] and if the yields are good enough on their high-priced products,
[844.98 → 850.50] that they can utilize the wafer extremely efficiently with a high-priced product,
[850.66 → 853.40] there is no reason for them to release these.
[853.40 → 859.78] Now, what we know, based on that they did discontinue production of their previous generation GPUs,
[859.86 → 864.86] is that their intention was to have enough supply with new silicon.
[865.44 → 866.94] Clearly, they don't.
[867.02 → 871.94] Not only can they not supply enough Ampere, they can't apparently supply enough Turing.
[872.20 → 874.64] So, they're going all the way back to Pascal.
[874.76 → 877.14] Now, Volta only, like, sort of existed.
[877.30 → 879.70] It was like, I don't even know how many SKUs.
[879.70 → 881.66] I don't think there was only, like, one consumer SKU.
[881.76 → 883.20] It was like a Titan V or something like that.
[883.46 → 886.46] Other than that, I think Volta basically only existed in the data centre.
[887.96 → 893.58] But they're going all the way back to Turing to serve the lower-end, kind of, like, e-sports-grade machines.
[894.06 → 897.56] I would call it like a mainstream gaming rig.
[898.92 → 900.08] Titan V and a QuadroCard.
[900.08 → 901.10] And there was a QuadroCard.
[901.16 → 901.40] All right.
[901.44 → 901.82] Thank you.
[902.00 → 903.62] Thank you for saving me from myself.
[904.60 → 910.08] The funny thing, though, is that apparently gamers think it's a great idea to bring back...
[910.60 → 913.10] Let me see if I can click for more information.
[913.22 → 916.14] Apparently, gamers think it's a great idea to bring back the 1050 Ti
[916.14 → 921.78] because it happens to be one of the most popular graphic cards of all time.
[922.34 → 924.46] So, 7%...
[924.46 → 924.94] Hold on a second.
[925.04 → 925.14] Yeah.
[925.30 → 929.48] 7% of all gamers on Steam are running a 1050 Ti
[929.48 → 933.16] and apparently think that's just fine because they're clearly not upgrading.
[933.34 → 934.94] Not that there's anything they could upgrade to.
[935.28 → 937.10] You know what's fascinating about that number
[937.10 → 939.64] and about the 1050 Ti in general
[939.64 → 943.94] is we are doing an average Steam gaming machine video
[943.94 → 945.00] that's coming out this weekend.
[945.60 → 949.74] So, we built the most average possible gaming machine.
[949.86 → 950.96] We ended up with a 1060
[950.96 → 953.68] because it slightly edged out the 1050 Ti.
[954.20 → 955.70] And we looked at, okay,
[955.94 → 959.48] how good is the gaming experience of the average Steam gamer?
[959.54 → 960.50] You know what the answer is?
[961.02 → 961.82] Pretty darn good.
[963.10 → 964.74] So, as...
[964.74 → 967.14] I think this is a great move from NVIDIA.
[967.14 → 971.50] Bringing back something for people to buy because...
[971.50 → 973.62] Yeah, I was going to say, just producing more stuff.
[974.38 → 975.20] Sounds good.
[975.44 → 976.36] Just anything.
[976.56 → 978.14] So, 1050 Ti was...
[978.74 → 979.96] Was that a 12 nanometre?
[980.80 → 984.00] How many nanometres was the 1050 Ti?
[985.50 → 986.06] 14.
[986.64 → 987.84] 14 nanometre.
[988.02 → 991.34] Dang, this thing launched in October 2016.
[992.32 → 994.10] That was four and a half years ago.
[994.10 → 996.76] I mean, it was a great card.
[997.26 → 998.50] It's still a solid card.
[999.48 → 1001.46] It doesn't have any ray tracing or anything.
[1001.72 → 1002.84] That was another funny one,
[1002.90 → 1005.66] especially in light of that stupid letter
[1005.66 → 1008.28] that NVIDIA sent and then retracted
[1008.28 → 1009.90] to Hardware Unboxed
[1009.90 → 1011.60] about how gamers have embraced RTX.
[1012.02 → 1015.34] When we were working on our Steam Hardware Survey machine,
[1015.78 → 1017.88] it was pretty interesting
[1017.88 → 1021.38] how embraced RTX is.
[1021.38 → 1025.80] So, the top RTX card, the 2060,
[1026.14 → 1031.56] has 3.72% of gaming machines
[1031.56 → 1033.28] to call its home.
[1034.00 → 1035.76] And the RTX 2060,
[1036.08 → 1037.86] I mean, I'm with Hardware Unboxed on this.
[1037.92 → 1039.16] The problem with RTX
[1039.16 → 1041.30] is that the most popular RTX cards
[1041.30 → 1045.56] are not capable of running games with RTX enabled.
[1045.66 → 1046.38] The 2060 is...
[1047.76 → 1050.82] From a real-time ray tracing perspective,
[1050.82 → 1052.46] just shouldn't exist.
[1052.98 → 1055.20] It should just be a GTX card
[1055.20 → 1057.10] with more CUBA cores
[1057.10 → 1059.18] and just not bother with the RTX-ness.
[1059.62 → 1061.60] That would have been a more compelling product
[1061.60 → 1063.70] that would have prompted more people to upgrade.
[1064.18 → 1064.90] And then next up,
[1064.96 → 1066.18] we've got the 2070 Super,
[1066.28 → 1067.90] which I would argue is actually
[1067.90 → 1070.32] RTX capable at 1080.
[1070.80 → 1073.70] But that's got just 2.3%
[1073.70 → 1075.02] of gamers
[1075.02 → 1076.82] are running...
[1076.82 → 1078.36] I suspect not a lot of people
[1078.36 → 1079.70] are trying to run
[1079.70 → 1081.78] like cranked 1080 with RTX.
[1083.58 → 1085.36] No, I would say most people
[1085.36 → 1087.90] that are buying a 70 and up class card
[1087.90 → 1089.86] are probably running 1440 or better.
[1089.98 → 1091.88] I do wish that Valve would give
[1091.88 → 1094.46] a little bit more granular insight
[1094.46 → 1095.28] into, you know,
[1095.66 → 1096.88] what kinds of...
[1096.88 → 1098.22] Like, if you clicked on a GPU,
[1098.36 → 1099.90] I'd love to know more about
[1099.90 → 1101.54] what kind of system that person is running.
[1101.62 → 1102.26] Yeah, that'd be cool.
[1102.26 → 1103.62] But I don't know.
[1103.80 → 1104.46] I don't think...
[1104.46 → 1106.12] I think Valve has enough buckets of money
[1106.12 → 1107.76] that they don't need to get into the business
[1107.76 → 1110.08] of becoming like an industry,
[1110.38 → 1110.74] you know,
[1111.10 → 1113.14] industry analysis provider,
[1113.70 → 1114.42] like information...
[1114.42 → 1115.74] Especially when they're doing it for free.
[1115.96 → 1116.16] Yeah.
[1116.40 → 1118.30] I wonder if they even...
[1118.30 → 1119.70] They might even just have that.
[1122.52 → 1124.14] I don't want to say this necessarily,
[1124.28 → 1125.50] but I have no idea.
[1125.60 → 1127.02] And there's probably a very provable way
[1127.02 → 1127.94] to say this is false.
[1127.94 → 1129.76] But I wouldn't be too surprised
[1129.76 → 1132.18] if they had more information like that.
[1132.38 → 1133.04] Oh, I'm sure they do.
[1133.36 → 1134.68] And it just wasn't public.
[1134.98 → 1135.52] Oh, absolutely.
[1135.84 → 1136.46] There's no way to go.
[1136.48 → 1137.92] They probably have deeper stats,
[1138.02 → 1139.64] but they just publish some of it
[1139.64 → 1141.24] to make it interesting.
[1141.42 → 1142.24] Yeah, I get some...
[1142.24 → 1143.06] And to make people want to contribute
[1143.06 → 1143.98] to the information pool.
[1144.12 → 1145.56] It's like the smartest thing ever
[1145.56 → 1147.86] because it throws them into the news cycle
[1147.86 → 1148.82] every month.
[1149.10 → 1149.58] Every month!
[1149.62 → 1150.42] And then people are like,
[1150.46 → 1151.74] oh, I should register my rig.
[1151.90 → 1152.32] Oh, yeah.
[1152.44 → 1152.80] Valve.
[1152.88 → 1153.66] They exist.
[1153.80 → 1153.98] Steam.
[1154.04 → 1154.76] I should get Steam
[1154.76 → 1156.02] because all gamers have Steam,
[1156.12 → 1157.02] like, or something.
[1158.08 → 1158.56] All right.
[1158.56 → 1160.48] Luke, I'm sorry.
[1160.56 → 1162.42] I've done a lot of talking on the show today,
[1162.42 → 1165.20] but I knew you were going to basically take over
[1165.20 → 1166.68] when we got into this next topic.
[1166.90 → 1169.62] Intel was caught fudging benchmarks
[1169.62 → 1174.28] in their M1 versus Core i7 11th gen comparison.
[1174.44 → 1176.34] This was posted by Jet ski on the forum,
[1176.58 → 1179.86] and the original source here is macrumors.com.
[1180.30 → 1182.96] Luke, what is going on here?
[1183.54 → 1184.64] We have to get through
[1184.64 → 1186.56] some of the talking points on here
[1186.56 → 1189.14] that aren't, like, super enthralling.
[1189.28 → 1190.60] Like, you've heard the title, right?
[1190.68 → 1191.92] Intel caught fudging benchmarks
[1191.92 → 1194.38] in M1 versus Core i7 11th gen comparison.
[1194.78 → 1194.98] Cool.
[1195.16 → 1196.24] That's honestly, like,
[1196.82 → 1199.02] pretty much all you should have needed to know
[1199.02 → 1201.72] if there wasn't the interesting ending.
[1201.88 → 1203.32] So I'm going to go through the talking points anyway,
[1203.88 → 1205.08] and then we'll get to the interesting part.
[1205.14 → 1205.96] So just stick with me.
[1206.28 → 1208.86] Intel is trying to promote its Eve branding
[1208.86 → 1210.40] of laptop standards
[1210.40 → 1212.56] against Apple's M1 successes.
[1212.56 → 1215.18] The campaign started with cherry-picked benchmarks
[1215.18 → 1217.10] that Intel published early this week,
[1217.46 → 1220.80] much to the consternation of Apple fans.
[1220.88 → 1221.76] Very nice writing.
[1222.14 → 1224.16] The benchmarks showcase the limitations
[1224.16 → 1227.18] of the early part of Apple's transition,
[1227.32 → 1229.78] comparing gaming, accessory compatibility,
[1229.78 → 1232.56] and performance in very specific tasks.
[1233.50 → 1234.46] There are some quotes here
[1234.46 → 1237.96] about the differences between the two devices,
[1238.42 → 1240.34] as well as, let's see,
[1240.34 → 1242.38] Intel's performance claims need to be taken
[1242.38 → 1243.66] with a certain grain of salt.
[1243.86 → 1244.06] Yeah.
[1244.08 → 1244.72] This is a quote.
[1245.08 → 1246.94] As their Intel-created tests
[1246.94 → 1248.50] and not industry-standard benchmarks,
[1248.98 → 1250.32] the fact they switched out
[1250.32 → 1252.98] between the Pro and the Air for battery life,
[1253.34 → 1254.22] that's kind of scummy,
[1254.62 → 1257.68] as well as the Core i7-1185G7
[1257.68 → 1260.20] and the Core i7-1165G7
[1260.20 → 1262.40] also shows an incomplete picture.
[1263.10 → 1265.34] And, I mean, that's just, yeah,
[1265.52 → 1267.04] swapping those laptops out is just ridiculous.
[1267.04 → 1270.44] Yeah, that's pretty suspect.
[1271.44 → 1272.84] This has happened before.
[1273.40 → 1277.64] We've had Intel kind of being not so clever
[1277.64 → 1280.52] with messing around benchmarks in the past.
[1280.60 → 1281.34] This is not new.
[1282.02 → 1284.88] Today, the company unveiled Twitter promotional posts,
[1284.88 → 1286.52] which ended in GOP.
[1286.78 → 1288.04] There are a few examples of that.
[1288.70 → 1289.04] But...
[1289.04 → 1290.20] GOP.
[1291.16 → 1291.92] Here's the fun part.
[1291.92 → 1293.20] It's a PC kind of world today, Luke.
[1293.64 → 1294.86] Here's the fun part.
[1295.18 → 1295.66] Okay.
[1295.66 → 1299.38] The Twitter ads link to a sponsored video
[1299.38 → 1300.84] by John Ettinger
[1300.84 → 1303.32] explaining the Eve talking points.
[1303.98 → 1304.36] Oh.
[1304.38 → 1305.90] And I want Linus to watch it.
[1306.00 → 1307.28] You want me to watch this?
[1307.48 → 1309.30] Because Linus hasn't seen it.
[1309.50 → 1310.48] I haven't seen this.
[1310.54 → 1311.44] I haven't even heard about this.
[1311.44 → 1312.96] And the comments and the like to dislike.
[1313.06 → 1313.34] Okay.
[1313.50 → 1314.40] Just hold on.
[1314.44 → 1314.68] Hold on.
[1314.74 → 1315.00] Hold on.
[1315.08 → 1315.44] Hold on.
[1315.54 → 1316.98] I just...
[1316.98 → 1317.22] Okay.
[1317.28 → 1318.92] Can I preface this by saying
[1318.92 → 1321.48] I like and respect John Ettinger a lot?
[1321.98 → 1322.44] He's great.
[1322.44 → 1322.96] He's...
[1322.96 → 1325.78] He has been a pioneer in the tech...
[1325.78 → 1326.82] Or not has been.
[1327.12 → 1330.78] He is a pioneer in the tech YouTube space.
[1331.58 → 1332.44] He is absolutely...
[1332.44 → 1332.46] And he's still around?
[1333.30 → 1335.30] He's absolutely still around.
[1335.40 → 1336.62] He's still going strong.
[1336.96 → 1341.62] He's one of the people that like I grew up following.
[1341.62 → 1342.00] Right?
[1342.12 → 1344.42] Like I followed in his footsteps.
[1344.42 → 1351.48] You know, he created the model in a lot of ways for like making a YouTube channel a business.
[1352.32 → 1354.72] Maybe not created but...
[1354.72 → 1355.30] It was very early.
[1356.04 → 1357.16] When we started working together.
[1357.26 → 1357.46] Yep.
[1357.56 → 1358.38] Was John Ettinger.
[1358.48 → 1360.14] So he's not talking out of his butt here.
[1360.28 → 1360.44] Yeah.
[1360.58 → 1362.28] You just got to watch it.
[1362.32 → 1362.64] Okay.
[1363.50 → 1365.74] So like no disrespect, John.
[1366.42 → 1367.42] I'm going to...
[1367.42 → 1368.06] Okay.
[1369.50 → 1370.64] I'm going to watch this now.
[1370.76 → 1371.48] I'm like...
[1371.48 → 1373.58] I'm kind of afraid to watch it live.
[1373.58 → 1379.68] Because you have not been making me feel good about what I'm about to see.
[1381.34 → 1381.70] Okay.
[1381.86 → 1382.26] Yeah.
[1382.46 → 1383.58] I'm trying to hold back.
[1383.66 → 1384.06] I'm not...
[1384.06 → 1385.22] I don't want to say anything about it.
[1385.26 → 1385.96] You just got to see it.
[1386.00 → 1386.30] Okay.
[1386.36 → 1386.70] Hold on.
[1386.80 → 1387.34] Let's just...
[1387.34 → 1387.72] You know what?
[1387.76 → 1391.04] I think it's very unlikely John is going to copyright strike us.
[1391.08 → 1392.42] So let's just watch it together.
[1392.54 → 1392.80] Okay?
[1394.28 → 1394.68] Okay.
[1394.68 → 1394.80] Okay.
[1395.04 → 1398.28] Your new laptop for 2021.
[1398.80 → 1399.24] All right.
[1403.58 → 1408.46] I mean...
[1408.46 → 1409.92] It's unfortunately kind of long.
[1416.92 → 1421.32] So I'm pretty vocal about using M1 Mac pretty much since launch.
[1421.82 → 1423.02] And for a lot of uses...
[1423.02 → 1423.24] Okay.
[1423.62 → 1424.40] It's been amazing...
[1424.40 → 1425.72] Do I have to watch the whole thing?
[1425.72 → 1426.22] And awesome.
[1426.38 → 1427.72] No, maybe skip through it.
[1427.72 → 1428.34] But the more I use it on the computer...
[1428.34 → 1428.64] Okay.
[1428.72 → 1433.24] ... I realize there's still a lot of stuff that it either doesn't do right now or just doesn't
[1433.24 → 1434.38] do at all.
[1434.68 → 1434.94] Okay.
[1434.94 → 1438.14] So Intel reached out to see if we wanted to talk about their new Eve platform.
[1438.26 → 1441.36] Give us no guidelines on things we could say or not say.
[1441.72 → 1442.66] Just to check it out.
[1442.66 → 1443.74] Are you getting the vibes yet?
[1443.74 → 1449.66] Kind of narrative since Apple announced their own silicon that Intel is out of the
[1449.66 → 1449.72] range.
[1449.72 → 1450.84] You look uncomfortable, Lance.
[1450.96 → 1451.72] What are your thoughts?
[1451.82 → 1452.78] What are your feelings right now?
[1452.78 → 1455.54] And I think that couldn't be further from the truth.
[1455.70 → 1460.28] With the Eve platform, you're getting just a ton of stuff that you just can't get from
[1460.28 → 1460.58] the Mac.
[1461.94 → 1466.04] So when you go to buy a laptop, really any laptop, not necessarily even an Intel one,
[1466.36 → 1470.92] sometimes hard to figure out which computer has got what and are you getting the best of
[1470.92 → 1472.18] whatever you're looking for.
[1472.18 → 1477.98] So what the Eve branding is essentially taken the most important specs and told any manufacturer
[1477.98 → 1481.76] who wanted to make an Intel based laptop that if you want to have the Eve branding, it's
[1481.76 → 1483.10] got to meet these minimum requirements.
[1483.52 → 1484.02] Okay.
[1485.02 → 1485.62] Um.
[1489.04 → 1489.56] Okay.
[1490.48 → 1490.86] Okay.
[1491.78 → 1492.26] Okay.
[1492.68 → 1495.40] So I think I follow so far.
[1496.36 → 1496.94] Um.
[1498.26 → 1502.04] We've got like the kind of Apple sound alike music.
[1502.18 → 1509.60] You know, it kind of gives me like, uh, like a back in the, the like, man, like a late
[1509.60 → 1510.98] nineties, like I Mac.
[1511.98 → 1513.38] Do do do.
[1513.48 → 1514.66] Or however, however that thing.
[1514.76 → 1517.68] Do do do do do do do.
[1517.76 → 1523.24] You know, like that kind of like Apple Music kind of vibe, like kind of like a think different
[1523.24 → 1523.86] kind of thing.
[1523.86 → 1526.38] Like mild, mildly sassy almost.
[1526.54 → 1526.74] Yeah.
[1526.86 → 1527.08] Yeah.
[1527.16 → 1531.64] Um, not like, not actually, but like a little bit like, yeah, we're, we're kind of like
[1531.64 → 1534.18] better and we know it and we just, you know.
[1534.18 → 1536.26] I just, um.
[1541.72 → 1542.24] Okay.
[1542.98 → 1546.06] Here's, here's the problem.
[1547.10 → 1549.54] Here's my, here's my problem.
[1551.46 → 1556.76] Intel's Eve branding initiative is actually not a terrible thing.
[1557.18 → 1560.54] So it's a lot better in my opinion than what Nvidia has been doing.
[1560.78 → 1563.78] Like Centring, um, way back in the day.
[1563.86 → 1567.56] And that honestly is where now, now we haven't covered Eve extensively.
[1567.56 → 1571.00] We haven't done any, we really haven't like worked with Intel on it much.
[1571.08 → 1573.46] Most of the stuff we've been doing with them lately has been on desktop.
[1574.32 → 1580.64] Um, so we haven't really, I haven't actually seen the Eve talking points other than I think
[1580.64 → 1586.68] we, oh man, I think we talked about it is briefly in like a review of Intel's like reference,
[1586.82 → 1592.36] um, Eve platform laptop that they're, that they're selling through, uh, XPG and then a
[1592.36 → 1593.32] couple of other resellers.
[1593.96 → 1598.00] So, um, Eve, like what, what is it basically?
[1598.16 → 1598.30] Yeah.
[1598.30 → 1600.80] It's like ultra book, or it's like Centring.
[1600.80 → 1603.54] It's another kind of like platform branding thing that they're doing.
[1603.78 → 1608.52] And there are things in there that I think are meaningful and important.
[1608.52 → 1613.34] For example, uh, your, your machine has to be able to wake from sleep in a certain amount
[1613.34 → 1613.70] of time.
[1613.78 → 1618.18] It's one of the things that drives me crazy about my XPS 13 two in one, or is it 12, whatever.
[1618.34 → 1622.80] But the two in one that I have is that it often takes a very long time to wake from sleep.
[1623.12 → 1625.86] Um, you have to meet a certain standard with respect to battery life.
[1625.90 → 1629.00] You have to use key Intel components like Centring.
[1629.52 → 1633.70] Centring was a game changer back in the day because a lot of you might not remember this,
[1633.70 → 1640.84] but in the early days of Wi-Fi, there were a lot of cheap wireless chipsets that low end
[1640.84 → 1646.44] laptop manufacturers would throw in their machines that were a very bad experience.
[1646.44 → 1649.02] I'm talking back in like the Wi-Fi B days.
[1649.48 → 1655.38] Um, and so Intel created Centring to force manufacturers to do three things using Intel
[1655.38 → 1656.46] CPU chipset.
[1656.46 → 1660.64] And in my opinion, most importantly, wireless chipset.
[1660.64 → 1664.58] And what this meant was compared to if you were using like, remember this is back when
[1664.58 → 1666.38] AMD didn't have anything competitive.
[1666.38 → 1672.16] So like a Turing on processor with some crap tactic Wi-Fi chipset.
[1672.22 → 1674.98] So you'd have like terrible battery life, terrible Wi-Fi.
[1675.14 → 1681.16] If you bought Centring, you knew you were going to get at least some measure of decent mobile
[1681.16 → 1681.68] experience.
[1681.68 → 1684.76] And I think that's what they're trying to do with Eve.
[1684.76 → 1695.12] So the problem here is that John, um, bless him, bless his heart, love him.
[1695.44 → 1708.24] Um, pioneer again, should not be the spokesman for like Intel and PC in my humble opinion.
[1708.24 → 1709.24] Yeah.
[1709.24 → 1712.28] And honestly, that's, that's what felt like the main problem to me as well.
[1712.60 → 1718.80] The way that it came across, like, I know John is an avid Mac user.
[1719.04 → 1724.90] The way that it came across, um, did not feel very sincere.
[1725.56 → 1731.40] And I think a big part of the problem too, was that a massive focus of the video was like,
[1731.74 → 1735.68] these are the ways that it is better than the M1 specifically.
[1735.68 → 1742.98] Like it was, it was digging so hard at the M1 more than it was talking about how cool Eve
[1742.98 → 1744.52] is in its own.
[1744.60 → 1751.64] It did both for sure, but it mostly felt like a M1 sucks video, and it felt like an Eve is
[1751.64 → 1752.26] great video.
[1752.38 → 1754.28] And there's another problem here.
[1754.72 → 1756.38] M1 does not suck.
[1756.38 → 1761.90] And as good as Eve laptops, battery life might be.
[1762.00 → 1765.16] And I saw some criticisms of the video that I really just didn't think were fair.
[1765.50 → 1769.10] Someone's like, Oh, all he says is great battery life, but he doesn't provide any numbers.
[1769.26 → 1773.84] You can't provide exact numbers for an entire lineup of laptops.
[1773.98 → 1778.28] Every manufacturer is going to put a different watt-hour battery into the machine.
[1778.28 → 1787.34] Like just the by, by its diverse nature, a PC or like the PC ecosystem cannot be as simply
[1787.34 → 1789.58] represented as the Mac ecosystem.
[1789.84 → 1795.26] But that for a lot of people, that's a good thing because it means more variety of price
[1795.26 → 1798.46] points and more variety of performance depending on what you need.
[1798.46 → 1800.50] And yes, more variety of battery life.
[1800.50 → 1805.84] Maybe you don't want to spend another hundred dollars on a 99.9 watt-hour battery.
[1806.02 → 1809.80] That's going to give you with an Eve platform, really great battery life.
[1810.22 → 1817.16] Maybe you're happy with a 56 watt-hour battery and like kind of, you know, good for a 56 watt
[1817.16 → 1818.92] hour battery, but not amazing battery life.
[1820.18 → 1827.62] So that, I don't think that's really fair, but I also think that it's, it's max of,
[1827.62 → 1832.82] um, I don't know.
[1832.92 → 1836.08] I don't, I don't even want to find the right word right now.
[1836.20 → 1844.92] It doesn't, it's not to say, to say that M1 is anything but very competitive is not, um,
[1845.40 → 1847.30] it's not a great marketing message.
[1847.30 → 1855.36] The best marketing, in my opinion, is to focus on your own strengths and just not discuss
[1855.36 → 1857.78] the problems with your competitor.
[1858.32 → 1860.28] That's how you market your product.
[1860.62 → 1862.02] You don't market your product.
[1862.02 → 1865.34] So you lead with strength instead of like, just look weak.
[1865.68 → 1865.82] Right?
[1866.18 → 1866.68] Exactly.
[1867.26 → 1872.82] I don't want, I don't want product marketing to become no offence, American politics.
[1873.58 → 1875.66] Talk about your platform.
[1876.12 → 1878.84] Don't just crap on why the other person is wrong.
[1878.84 → 1880.78] Present your ideas.
[1881.20 → 1885.54] And then if you happen to agree about good ideas, that's okay.
[1886.12 → 1891.62] Let's stop treating it like every idea that the other side has is bad just because they
[1891.62 → 1892.10] had it.
[1892.68 → 1893.46] If, right.
[1893.96 → 1894.22] Right.
[1894.32 → 1900.32] Like if team red versus team blue and whether, you know, I could be talking about PCs.
[1900.32 → 1902.12] I could be talking about anything right now.
[1902.24 → 1902.44] Okay.
[1902.62 → 1902.84] Sure.
[1902.84 → 1908.88] If team red's like, you know what, a really wide high interconnect is a great idea.
[1909.20 → 1915.20] If team blue automatically said we should have more bottlenecks just because team red
[1915.20 → 1918.92] thought that a wide interconnect is a great idea, that would be stupid.
[1918.92 → 1924.70] And we should all, we should all, you know, be able to recognize that that's really stupid
[1924.70 → 1926.58] and agree on basic things.
[1926.58 → 1926.88] Okay.
[1928.56 → 1934.80] So I, uh, and, and like even just the opening with the like not being able to plug into
[1934.80 → 1936.24] type C, it's like, I agree.
[1936.42 → 1937.00] I agree.
[1937.06 → 1937.70] That's a problem.
[1937.98 → 1939.78] I had that problem today.
[1939.78 → 1940.18] Okay.
[1940.18 → 1946.06] I wanted to plug in a USB thumb drive while we were doing Andy's Intel, uh, extreme tech
[1946.06 → 1948.60] upgrade also sponsored by Intel to be clear.
[1948.60 → 1950.30] I love Intel work with them all the time.
[1950.30 → 1950.62] Okay.
[1951.18 → 1954.60] Um, and I wanted to plug a thumb drive into my XPS.
[1954.60 → 1954.96] Right.
[1954.96 → 1961.22] And I was like, because I was, I was in the middle of something and like, I was in a hurry
[1961.22 → 1962.60] trying to get to a WAN show.
[1962.60 → 1964.80] And I was like, I have to go get this f***ING dongle.
[1964.88 → 1965.96] I'm so f***ING mad.
[1966.18 → 1968.22] Like to be clear, I get it.
[1968.26 → 1971.72] I understand that frustration, but I was using an f***ING PC.
[1971.94 → 1972.44] Wasn't I?
[1972.82 → 1975.10] It's not like the PC doesn't have this problem.
[1975.36 → 1975.66] Okay.
[1975.84 → 1979.52] This is a this is a, a, a twenties' problem.
[1979.78 → 1980.16] Okay.
[1980.28 → 1983.52] That computers have gotten too thin to put a type A.
[1983.52 → 1985.72] Actually, they're not even too thin to put a type A.
[1986.10 → 1991.02] Manufacturers just are not putting type A's on them because they've gotten ahead of themselves
[1991.02 → 1991.68] a little bit.
[1991.78 → 1993.40] To be clear, I love Thunderbolt.
[1993.74 → 1994.44] Love Thunderbolt.
[1994.64 → 1995.40] Love type C.
[1995.64 → 1998.86] But that doesn't mean we're ready to say completely goodbye to type A.
[1998.96 → 2003.20] But to pretend that this is a uniquely Mac problem is just.
[2003.20 → 2007.34] I also, I could be missing something, but I don't think there's anything in the Eve standard
[2007.34 → 2009.10] about including type A ports.
[2009.22 → 2010.20] No, not to my knowledge.
[2010.48 → 2013.90] So there's probably Eve laptops that are going to have the exact same problem.
[2014.00 → 2014.08] Right.
[2014.08 → 2018.66] And as much as I like to hammer on, I've done it a lot.
[2018.92 → 2023.16] As much as I like to hammer on Apple for connectivity things, I think they have issues with this
[2023.16 → 2025.00] like across a few other different products.
[2025.00 → 2030.38] Not the right place or time, in my opinion.
[2031.28 → 2031.60] So.
[2033.98 → 2038.50] Video didn't really hit the mark, and it missed the mark enough that it.
[2038.50 → 2042.68] It hurts the campaign a bit and just doesn't.
[2042.82 → 2042.96] Yeah.
[2043.28 → 2044.44] You know what it smacks of?
[2044.46 → 2045.10] A little problematic.
[2045.66 → 2047.82] You know what I, you know what I smell right now?
[2048.20 → 2050.00] I smell an advertising agency.
[2050.48 → 2057.90] If I had to guess, I would, I would put money on it that instead of this being John and Intel
[2057.90 → 2064.96] representatives who really know their products and know the state of the market, this smells
[2064.96 → 2070.34] like the kind of thing that came through an agency that doesn't really understand what's
[2070.34 → 2070.86] going on.
[2070.94 → 2073.34] And I've, I'm on the record saying this before.
[2074.04 → 2075.52] And there are exceptions.
[2076.08 → 2079.86] And if you're an agency that works with Linus Media Group, hey, you're an exception.
[2083.20 → 2089.92] Most agencies, most agency marketing representatives have just absolutely no idea what they're talking
[2089.92 → 2090.22] about.
[2090.32 → 2094.70] They have absolutely no business being involved in tech marketing.
[2094.96 → 2100.28] And they should frankly just step out of the way, stop taking their worthless middleman
[2100.28 → 2102.32] cut and leave it to the experts.
[2102.32 → 2108.12] Like I was, I was on the phone with, I was on the phone with AMD about something really
[2108.12 → 2109.82] exciting that we've got coming up.
[2111.24 → 2116.32] We're working with AMD, ASUS and MSI on a really cool initiative.
[2116.48 → 2120.38] Luke knows about this because he's had to make some, his, the float plane team has been
[2120.38 → 2124.32] working on some cool development stuff for me, for this.
[2124.40 → 2125.34] It's really exciting.
[2125.34 → 2131.46] Anyway, I was on the phone with AMD, and they basically were like, okay, hey, like, okay,
[2131.54 → 2133.12] last thing from our upper management.
[2133.44 → 2140.50] We just need to know if you can, if you can like to message it in this way instead of, and
[2140.50 → 2142.34] I'm like, what do you think?
[2142.34 → 2143.78] I'm some kind of amateur.
[2143.78 → 2144.80] Like, I don't know.
[2144.88 → 2147.74] I don't know how to, how to message something correctly.
[2147.74 → 2149.88] And I like, I even, I cut them off.
[2149.92 → 2151.54] I was like, don't even finish that sentence.
[2151.74 → 2152.96] Here's how it's going to be messaged.
[2152.96 → 2156.76] They're like, wow, that's exactly, that's exactly how it should be.
[2156.80 → 2159.70] I'm like, I know this is not my first kick at the can.
[2159.70 → 2165.90] The problem is you get like, you know, I'm just going to, these are random names.
[2166.00 → 2166.16] Okay.
[2166.18 → 2167.04] These are random names.
[2167.12 → 2171.64] They're nothing to do with specific people that we've worked with, but you get agency
[2171.64 → 2172.44] Sarah.
[2172.76 → 2173.20] Okay.
[2173.20 → 2177.98] Or agency Jeff who know absolutely nothing about computers.
[2177.98 → 2184.86] They know nothing about AMD or Intel or Nvidia or, or Apple or anything.
[2184.86 → 2193.58] And all they know is whatever stupid marketing deck that agency, you know, Clarisse put together
[2193.58 → 2197.88] for them and handed to them, and they start getting involved.
[2197.88 → 2200.86] And they're like, actually, Linus, we don't really want you to say it that way.
[2200.90 → 2202.24] And I'm like, that's nice.
[2202.76 → 2207.00] That's great that you don't want me to say it that way, but that's the honest truth.
[2207.00 → 2213.40] And you know, from a from, okay, ethics aside from a legal standpoint, I can't say anything
[2213.40 → 2215.20] that's not true or that I don't believe.
[2215.20 → 2218.88] So you're just going to have to step aside, and I'm going to message it however I want.
[2218.94 → 2220.98] And if you don't like it, then we're canning the campaign.
[2221.86 → 2227.42] And honestly, that that's how the conversation goes with these agencies more often than you
[2227.42 → 2228.62] guys would probably believe.
[2228.62 → 2234.46] And the stupidest thing about it, we actually are responsible for a major brand canning their
[2234.46 → 2236.36] agency about a week ago.
[2237.00 → 2244.06] No, because, because they were just, it was such a cluster them trying to get involved
[2244.06 → 2245.94] in the messaging and in the content creation.
[2246.60 → 2251.48] As soon as they were gone, we get on the phone with the brand representatives directly.
[2251.48 → 2255.02] We're like, okay, here's the reason we have to do it this way because of the competitive
[2255.02 → 2255.48] landscape.
[2255.48 → 2257.82] And because we don't want to market anything.
[2257.82 → 2261.54] We want to, we want to put your product in its best light, but we don't want to misrepresent
[2261.54 → 2261.80] it.
[2262.10 → 2263.48] That's good marketing.
[2263.48 → 2269.98] We want to communicate the positives of your brand and of your product without putting
[2269.98 → 2273.34] down anyone else and without misrepresenting it in any way.
[2273.34 → 2276.44] And they're like, yeah, that's exactly what we wanted to do.
[2276.52 → 2277.56] No, I'm not done here.
[2277.98 → 2280.16] They were like, yeah, that's exactly what we wanted to do.
[2280.24 → 2283.26] And the entire problem, the entire campaign was saved.
[2283.36 → 2284.44] The problem was solved.
[2284.86 → 2285.76] It's agencies.
[2286.08 → 2287.16] I bet, you know what?
[2287.36 → 2288.56] I bet he's in my phone book.
[2288.86 → 2291.66] I'm going to call him right now because I want to know.
[2291.66 → 2294.54] I am, I am, I'm pretty sure.
[2294.74 → 2298.34] I'm pretty sure I have, uh, just while, while you're dialling.
[2298.34 → 2299.06] Do I not have done sedentary?
[2299.06 → 2303.22] For the steroids out there that are currently feeling very negative.
[2303.48 → 2304.30] Who's feeling negative?
[2305.00 → 2307.28] For the, the various Sarah's out there.
[2307.34 → 2308.00] Oh, oh.
[2308.54 → 2314.94] There, there, there have been times, um, where we've worked with agencies and it's been good.
[2314.94 → 2322.44] I, I would definitely say it's not as common as it being bad, but it has been.
[2323.12 → 2323.44] Yes.
[2323.46 → 2324.92] It's usually individuals.
[2324.92 → 2326.22] It's not the agency in general.
[2326.22 → 2329.30] You'll run into an individual, and they like actually really care.
[2329.96 → 2333.02] Um, yeah, it's, it's, it's not that common.
[2333.02 → 2337.50] But the thing is, so here it's part of it is just the nature of the industry, right guys?
[2337.96 → 2344.36] Because you got to understand if I'm an Intel or AMD, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, whoever I am,
[2344.36 → 2346.60] like I'm a tier one player in the tech space.
[2346.92 → 2347.18] Okay.
[2347.46 → 2353.92] I've got this agency to handle my marketing stuff because I, um, there's a variety of
[2353.92 → 2355.16] reasons that you might do that.
[2355.22 → 2361.14] One is that it adds a degree of, uh, it adds a degree of separation from the messaging.
[2361.14 → 2364.56] So if something does go wrong, it's someone to blame.
[2364.86 → 2366.30] It keeps them off your payroll.
[2366.58 → 2372.00] So if you need to scale up or scale down your marketing staff, it's a lot simpler to hire
[2372.00 → 2377.60] or fire an agency than to hire or fire a team of people to work within your company.
[2377.60 → 2382.78] Like there are reasons that you use agencies, but from the very nature of that relationship,
[2382.78 → 2389.54] agencies tend to get the talented people sucked out of them because they don't pay particularly
[2389.54 → 2396.22] well compared to actually making something, whether it's content or whether it's a product,
[2396.22 → 2396.66] right?
[2396.66 → 2399.06] So they're inherently a middleman.
[2399.86 → 2406.76] And if you're talented, what's going to happen is because you have this direct exposure to
[2406.76 → 2413.40] fish that can pay way better and better opportunities, you're going to get sucked out one way or the
[2413.40 → 2413.66] other.
[2413.82 → 2419.90] So you just end up with a lot of the perfect people in agencies getting pulled into work
[2419.90 → 2425.24] permanently for the brands that they represent or for the media companies that they work with.
[2425.24 → 2430.76] Like when we encounter a perfect agency representative, we had a perfect one with LG for a long
[2430.76 → 2431.04] time.
[2431.54 → 2436.80] If it wasn't for the complications around, you know, bringing someone into Canada, for example,
[2436.80 → 2442.44] to work, that's the kind of person where for as like a as like a brand representative on our
[2442.44 → 2448.22] side, we would strongly consider just hiring them rather than putting out like a job listing
[2448.22 → 2453.04] on our website, because we already know that they like, they like to get it, right?
[2453.04 → 2453.48] Yeah.
[2453.80 → 2459.28] Because it's not as simple as just coming up with talking points and making sure the
[2459.28 → 2460.18] influencer says them.
[2460.34 → 2462.16] You have to actually follow through.
[2462.26 → 2466.52] You have to think this thing through and make sure that it makes sense and that it's not
[2466.52 → 2467.84] going to create backlash, right?
[2468.56 → 2474.70] Honestly, my favourite people to work with were just people who, they were facilitators, you
[2474.70 → 2474.86] know?
[2474.86 → 2478.44] They would just very expertly get out of the way.
[2478.82 → 2484.12] They would, they would make sure that what the company needed to get done was like at
[2484.12 → 2485.82] the very least getting done.
[2485.98 → 2488.80] And then they'd let you just style and do your thing.
[2488.96 → 2490.30] That was, that was fantastic.
[2490.60 → 2493.14] And there was a few of them, and they were amazing to work with.
[2493.14 → 2495.92] Um, but yeah, they weren't that common.
[2496.18 → 2500.76] Usually it was people that were like, no, I need to like to leave my mark and leave my influence
[2500.76 → 2501.46] on this project.
[2501.46 → 2505.58] So I'm going to like to try to force this thing to happen or force this thing to be sad or
[2505.58 → 2506.50] sad or whatever else.
[2506.50 → 2507.40] And it was just a pain.
[2508.30 → 2509.02] It's horrible.
[2509.82 → 2513.50] I don't have a John Ettinger's phone number, unfortunately.
[2514.14 → 2516.20] Uh, but I'm just gonna, I'm just going to ask him.
[2516.28 → 2518.20] I'm just going to ask him my one simple question.
[2518.20 → 2523.50] I said, you around just one question, that Intel video through an agency or dealing with
[2523.50 → 2524.26] Intel directly?
[2527.48 → 2530.06] Says, uh, doing family stuff right now.
[2530.12 → 2530.78] That's fair enough.
[2531.24 → 2532.06] Uh, hold on, hold on.
[2532.08 → 2533.18] He's typing another message though.
[2533.26 → 2538.44] Because I, I, my first message, uh, oh, okay.
[2538.66 → 2541.10] He says, I think it was Intel directly.
[2542.42 → 2543.28] Oh, okay.
[2543.70 → 2546.62] I, yeah, I'm, I'm surprised.
[2546.62 → 2554.96] Um, I'm just going to say usually they're more savvy than that.
[2555.58 → 2557.56] Um, okay.
[2557.68 → 2558.44] Well, all right.
[2558.52 → 2559.96] Well, I don't know.
[2560.12 → 2560.82] I don't know.
[2560.96 → 2562.30] I mean, it all depends, right?
[2562.36 → 2565.50] A company that big, you're going to have people that like really get it.
[2565.74 → 2571.62] Like I've met people that every, like, I think brilliant idea that I pitched them for like
[2571.62 → 2573.40] cool stuff Intel could do for enthusiasts.
[2573.40 → 2577.88] They've like, they already pitched it five or 10 years ago or whatever, like just really
[2577.88 → 2578.68] dialled in.
[2578.84 → 2582.54] Like, I'm pretty sure water cooling fluid runs in their veins.
[2583.06 → 2584.90] Um, so you find people like that.
[2584.90 → 2588.02] And then you find people that are just like, I don't know what's gaming.
[2588.52 → 2590.46] Um, you know, I'm sorry.
[2590.54 → 2592.74] I'm, I'm just like, I'm just like a numbers' person, right?
[2592.74 → 2598.04] Um, you know, you have any group of however many, like thousands and thousands of people
[2598.04 → 2598.68] work at Intel.
[2598.68 → 2601.28] You're going to have some that like really get it and some that don't.
[2602.52 → 2605.14] Oh, okay.
[2605.22 → 2607.88] I don't know if I can talk about this.
[2608.54 → 2610.62] Uh, can I talk about that?
[2610.68 → 2612.40] I'm kind of live.
[2612.40 → 2617.88] Do you want me to spin off into the CD project red?
[2618.24 → 2618.40] Sure.
[2618.66 → 2619.00] Actually.
[2619.12 → 2619.82] Oh my goodness.
[2619.88 → 2621.06] We need to do our sponsors.
[2621.38 → 2624.44] Speaking of, I was going to say, or do you want to try to do a sponsor segment while you
[2624.44 → 2625.34] wait for some responses?
[2625.36 → 2626.26] Working with agencies.
[2626.26 → 2626.54] Yeah.
[2626.58 → 2628.02] Why don't we, why don't we run through our sponsors?
[2628.14 → 2628.52] Okay.

[2730.48 → 2732.44] I remember when Sea sonic didn't even like market.

[2734.14 → 2736.22] We just like make awesome power supplies real quietly.
[2736.22 → 2738.48] We don't even, we don't even paint the metal black.

[2795.94 → 2796.78] All right.
[2797.02 → 2800.42] Back to, I really got to fix that so it doesn't do that weird thing.
[2800.90 → 2802.58] He asked live on what?
[2802.76 → 2802.92] Yeah.
[2803.04 → 2803.32] Okay.
[2803.42 → 2805.98] So we're not going to talk any more about that.
[2806.12 → 2808.90] Clearly that was a bad experience.
[2809.64 → 2810.94] But you know what, guys?
[2811.40 → 2812.20] Do me a favour.
[2812.30 → 2812.62] Okay.
[2813.04 → 2814.74] Go check out John's channel.
[2814.74 → 2823.48] He, like, only recently, like, what was it, about a year ago, I guess, broke off from Techno buffalo, which was his baby.
[2823.88 → 2826.00] And he's been making some perfect stuff.
[2826.12 → 2830.04] I don't want this one video to colour your experience with him.
[2830.04 → 2836.38] Because he's done some really, really cool stuff since he picked it back up and started producing videos on his own again.
[2836.70 → 2837.84] So go check out his channel.
[2837.94 → 2839.16] It's just John Ettinger now.
[2839.28 → 2841.10] It's not Techno buffalo or anything like that.
[2841.16 → 2841.68] Go subscribe.
[2842.24 → 2843.56] He does some really cool stuff.
[2843.62 → 2846.00] He's got, like, car videos, TVs, phones.
[2846.64 → 2850.62] I mean, he's been in the industry so long that there's kind of no limit to what he can do.
[2852.50 → 2853.12] All right.
[2853.22 → 2854.12] So let's move on.
[2854.68 → 2855.08] Yeah.
[2855.14 → 2858.08] Do you want to talk through the CD Project Red thing?
[2858.08 → 2858.48] Yeah.
[2859.20 → 2861.50] So this is kind of interesting.
[2862.12 → 2867.72] CD Project Red, I don't think, has exactly been in the community's graces as much as it used to be in the past.
[2867.96 → 2869.82] For, used to be in the past.
[2870.84 → 2873.08] As much as it used to be for quite a while now.
[2873.70 → 2876.64] Ever since the launch of Cyberpunk, really.
[2877.20 → 2879.24] Earlier this week, CD Project Red announced.
[2879.56 → 2881.44] Even leading up to Cyberpunk, Luke.
[2881.52 → 2882.16] Hold on a second.
[2882.26 → 2884.26] Let's get the timeline straight here.
[2884.26 → 2892.20] Because there was some weirdo, there was some really edgy, like, not actually that cool marketing that they did before the launch of Cyberpunk, too.
[2892.88 → 2898.64] Like, they've been working their way into, like, making people, the gaming community mad for a while now.
[2898.64 → 2903.26] So, when they were kind of the diamond child for a while there, too.
[2903.74 → 2916.14] Anyway, earlier this week, CD Project Red announced that it had been hit with a ransomware attack that allegedly exposed the source code for games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and The Witcher 3.
[2916.14 → 2920.70] So, you know, kind of, not all of it, but, you know.
[2921.54 → 2928.48] VX Underground reported Wednesday that source code had been posted on a dark web forum known as Exploit.
[2928.72 → 2930.42] Pretty on the nose right there.
[2930.74 → 2935.80] The starting bid was reportedly $1 million with a $500,000 bidding increment.
[2935.98 → 2936.18] Wow.
[2936.26 → 2937.38] That's reasonable.
[2937.38 → 2941.36] And a $7 million buy-it-now price.
[2941.78 → 2948.24] Forum users needed to put up 0.1 BTC, roughly currently $4,700, but, you know, it's always fluctuating.
[2948.46 → 2949.98] Just to participate in the bidding?
[2951.44 → 2951.84] Yeah.
[2952.18 → 2954.00] So, huge ticket.
[2954.12 → 2956.22] They were looking for massive high rollers, you know.
[2958.32 → 2961.48] The auction was originally intended to run for 48 hours.
[2961.60 → 2966.36] By Thursday morning, it had been closed successfully, quote-unquote.
[2966.36 → 2966.84] Interesting.
[2966.84 → 2976.18] There was an offer that was received from outside the forum that was said to have satisfied the said hackers.
[2976.56 → 2979.16] There is some doubt about what has happened.
[2979.30 → 2980.86] This type of thing has happened before.
[2981.02 → 2989.42] If they don't receive a bid, they just close it and say, like, ah, someone else bought it, so that it doesn't look like a failure.
[2989.88 → 2990.56] Who knows?
[2990.76 → 2991.70] Maybe it was successful.
[2991.88 → 2993.70] Maybe they got $7 million.
[2994.12 → 2994.90] Maybe they got more.
[2995.00 → 2995.70] Maybe they got less.
[2995.70 → 2997.68] Or maybe they didn't get anything.
[2998.90 → 3007.86] There is, yeah, like, there's a quote from Missort threat analyst, Brett Callow, who said,
[3007.86 → 3016.46] we have seen this behaviour in the past with Weevil, a ransomware group that threatened to release damaging information about Donald Trump, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3017.02 → 3027.04] Security experts analyzing the ransom note shared by CDPR have identified a hacking group known as Hello Kitty as the likely culprit.
[3027.04 → 3028.04] That same group was reported.
[3028.04 → 3037.16] That same group was reportedly behind a ransomware attack on Brazilian power company, CE MIG, among others, late last year.
[3037.70 → 3039.24] What a fantastic name for their group.
[3039.24 → 3043.36] But, yeah, kind of spicy.
[3044.72 → 3045.62] It's interesting.
[3046.16 → 3054.54] I believe it didn't mention it in the notes that I had just gone over, but I believe it also included at least some of the source code for the Red engine.
[3054.54 → 3055.02] Wow.
[3055.02 → 3055.62] Wow.
[3055.62 → 3055.94] Wow.
[3056.94 → 3060.76] Which is, to me, maybe more interesting than the games.
[3061.18 → 3061.62] Yeah.
[3062.54 → 3063.10] Yeah.
[3063.34 → 3078.66] Because, like, I mean, you know, I'm sure there's some way for CD Project Red to figure it out soon enough if someone's got their hands on Cyberpunk 2077 source code in a game that obviously would have to run on the Red engine.
[3078.66 → 3078.86] Yeah.
[3079.38 → 3079.62] Yeah.
[3079.62 → 3088.32] You know, like, if you're a developer, it's like, oh, yeah, suddenly we're licensing Red engine and, like, we've got a lot of, like...
[3088.32 → 3089.96] The game that looks and feels really similar.
[3090.08 → 3090.38] Yeah.
[3090.58 → 3091.86] Don't look too closely.
[3092.54 → 3094.24] So, yeah, there is a note here.
[3094.34 → 3095.94] Sorry, I guess I didn't see that right away.
[3095.94 → 3105.70] But the sellers also reportedly provided file listings for Gwent and the Red engine that underlies CDPR's games as proof that the data was authentic.
[3106.96 → 3107.48] Wow.
[3107.48 → 3107.52] Wow.
[3108.12 → 3108.80] This is a...
[3108.80 → 3110.00] So, not quite what I thought, but...
[3110.00 → 3111.34] This is a crazy leak.
[3111.48 → 3112.90] I just have no idea.
[3113.36 → 3115.68] You know, I mean, someone could have bought it.
[3115.74 → 3127.04] Like, I don't think any, like, Western game developer would buy this out of fear that CD Project Red would go after them once they inevitably figured out who had it.
[3127.04 → 3144.38] But if you were, like, say, a Chinese game developer or something like that, I could conceivably see you just kind of hiding behind the shield of the Chinese government, basically just not allowing CD Project Red to litigate this.
[3144.38 → 3149.64] Or even, like, a small new studio that for some reason has a crazy amount of money behind it.
[3149.64 → 3151.50] Because you could just learn a lot.
[3151.80 → 3154.70] Even if you didn't use it in your game, you could learn a lot.
[3154.94 → 3155.40] A lot.
[3155.60 → 3156.52] From something like that.
[3156.84 → 3158.34] Like, maybe what not to do.
[3158.34 → 3167.36] No, but seriously, you could genuinely learn a lot from a code base like that.
[3167.52 → 3168.78] So, it's interesting.
[3169.04 → 3169.82] It's fascinating.
[3171.18 → 3171.68] All right.
[3172.06 → 3172.54] Twitter.
[3172.70 → 3173.60] Twitter subscription model.
[3173.60 → 3174.00] Yeah.
[3174.10 → 3178.04] Twitter is exploring a potential subscription model to ease its dependence on ad revenue.
[3178.16 → 3184.70] It's so funny that we're talking about this because David and I were talking earlier today while we were filming Andy's Extreme Tech Upgrade.
[3185.48 → 3191.04] And we were talking about how, like, Facebook probably wouldn't introduce something like YouTube Premium.
[3191.04 → 3208.12] And reason being that Facebook does put so much effort into making sponsored content, ads, and real content look and feel so similar that it's all kind of part of one experience.
[3208.88 → 3220.10] And in our mind, anything, any effort that they're putting into anything other than that would seem to fly in the face of all the work that they've done so far.
[3220.10 → 3227.92] One of the things Facebook has done very well, at least from our experience with them, is monetized the shit out of content.
[3228.38 → 3233.70] Like, our ad rates on Facebook for video are way higher.
[3233.98 → 3235.90] Like, way higher than YouTube.
[3236.10 → 3239.66] Like, it is unbelievable how much higher they are.
[3240.16 → 3247.92] And so, I'm looking at it going, like, clearly, there is something Facebook is doing very well here with the way that they're able to sell ads.
[3247.92 → 3259.68] Not just sell ads at such a high rate, but also serve ads at such a volume that, for whatever reason, users accept it when they wouldn't on another platform.
[3260.20 → 3263.72] And content creators can make a ton of money being on that platform.
[3263.72 → 3273.04] And so, to me, if Facebook were to go and kind of split the audience in that way, it would almost be detrimental to the platform.
[3273.04 → 3284.20] Because that's one of the things they do so well is they create this, like, this network where you, through Facebook ads, you find products and, like, join groups.
[3284.20 → 3292.12] And continue to kind of put out, like, Facebook tendrils and, like, build this sphere of influence and this influence on you.
[3292.20 → 3295.98] Like, it just doesn't seem like something they would be interested in.
[3296.08 → 3299.12] And that made us turn to talking about other platforms.
[3299.58 → 3302.16] So, David was like, yeah, I couldn't live without my YouTube premium now.
[3302.38 → 3306.22] Because I just find ads so much more intrusive on that platform.
[3306.36 → 3307.70] Part of it is that he doesn't use Facebook.
[3307.98 → 3308.74] And neither do I.
[3308.80 → 3309.90] So, maybe that's why we don't care.
[3309.90 → 3313.24] But he was like, yeah, I could see that being great for Twitter.
[3313.60 → 3314.62] And I was like, oh, why Twitter?
[3315.20 → 3316.42] Like, I don't even see ads on Twitter.
[3316.50 → 3317.96] He's like, yeah, there are tons of ads on Twitter.
[3318.02 → 3318.74] I'm like, what are you talking about?
[3318.76 → 3320.12] He's like, well, it's in your, like, home feed.
[3320.18 → 3321.40] I'm like, oh, yeah, I don't look at the home feed.
[3321.80 → 3324.22] I only look at my mentions because I'm a narcissist.
[3326.32 → 3327.88] So, there's, like, no ads in there.
[3328.44 → 3329.68] But apparently...
[3329.68 → 3331.40] And because Twitter's, like, kind of just stupid.
[3332.02 → 3333.84] Like, the home feed's just...
[3333.84 → 3335.38] It's so not interesting.
[3335.52 → 3336.40] Anyway, sorry, keep going.
[3336.40 → 3338.54] Maybe that's just because you don't follow interesting people.
[3338.54 → 3340.16] Like, you know, I know a lot of people...
[3340.16 → 3341.56] Maybe, I just, like...
[3341.56 → 3344.28] Made a lot of money on Dogecoin following Elon Musk
[3344.28 → 3346.48] and, like, quickly buying Doge whenever he mentions it.
[3346.56 → 3348.32] So, like, apparently that's a thing.
[3348.90 → 3351.06] There are a few people that I like to check in with
[3351.06 → 3353.48] that I'm friends with that I don't have, like,
[3353.48 → 3354.98] a ton of communication with outside of Twitter.
[3355.02 → 3356.58] But I usually just go directly to their pages.
[3357.20 → 3360.84] But, like, I've talked about this on Sancho before.
[3361.00 → 3363.80] But, like, the homepage is just awkward
[3363.80 → 3365.74] because you see what everybody likes.
[3365.74 → 3368.14] And a lot of times it's just, like,
[3368.22 → 3371.60] their, like, friend talking about their day.
[3372.10 → 3373.10] Like, it's not, like,
[3373.26 → 3376.12] this has nothing to do with me at all.
[3376.20 → 3377.62] But it's in my feed for whatever reason.
[3377.84 → 3378.80] Or it'll just be, like,
[3378.90 → 3382.02] somebody who was, like, horny at two in the morning
[3382.02 → 3384.04] and just liked some picture of somebody
[3384.04 → 3385.74] in some fairly revealing way.
[3386.48 → 3388.38] And I'm like, yeah, I didn't need to know that.
[3388.38 → 3389.68] I didn't know that guy.
[3390.60 → 3393.70] It's like, if I wanted to sit and, you know,
[3394.82 → 3397.88] with you, then I would tell you that, you know?
[3398.32 → 3400.88] Yeah, like, this doesn't need to be a group activity.
[3401.00 → 3402.44] You really don't need to like that on Twitter.
[3402.60 → 3403.36] We're not judging.
[3403.66 → 3404.54] We're not kink-shaming.
[3404.98 → 3406.54] If you want it to be a group activity,
[3406.64 → 3408.24] that's totally fine with us.
[3408.88 → 3409.14] Yeah.
[3409.34 → 3412.62] We just don't need to involuntarily participate in it.
[3412.66 → 3413.10] You know what I'm saying?
[3413.10 → 3415.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3417.44 → 3418.40] All right, cool.
[3419.16 → 3420.94] So anyway, apparently,
[3421.68 → 3424.42] a subscription model to ease their dependence on ad revenue
[3424.42 → 3426.14] is something they've been considering for years,
[3426.14 → 3428.44] but one that's become a greater priority
[3428.44 → 3430.12] given the current global pandemic
[3430.12 → 3432.02] and pressure from investors to accelerate growth.
[3432.10 → 3432.70] That's interesting.
[3433.20 → 3433.94] Because if anything,
[3433.94 → 3438.84] the global pandemic has had an incredible impact positively
[3438.84 → 3442.66] on the kinds of ad revenue that we've seen
[3442.66 → 3444.94] online, like right now,
[3445.14 → 3446.72] for this time of year,
[3447.40 → 3450.92] we are doing like unbelievable.
[3451.60 → 3452.82] So compared to last year,
[3452.92 → 3454.92] viewership is, I would say,
[3455.32 → 3457.46] fairly, hold on a second.
[3457.54 → 3458.40] I don't want to just pull,
[3458.50 → 3460.70] I don't want to be talking out of my butt here.
[3460.78 → 3462.40] So let me get some like real numbers for you.
[3462.82 → 3464.86] So viewership is similar
[3464.86 → 3467.90] compared to this time last year.
[3467.90 → 3470.42] And at least on YouTube,
[3470.42 → 3473.48] our ad revenue is up like,
[3473.92 → 3475.16] hold on a second.
[3475.32 → 3477.00] Again, I don't want to be talking out of my butt here.
[3477.46 → 3479.90] Up anywhere from like 10%,
[3480.50 → 3482.02] depending, 15%,
[3482.02 → 3483.90] depending on the day to like 40%,
[3484.50 → 3485.98] like way up.
[3486.12 → 3487.08] So I would think if,
[3487.08 → 3490.88] if Twitter's not extracting more value
[3490.88 → 3491.58] from their,
[3491.64 → 3493.04] from their advertising partners,
[3493.14 → 3494.70] they're probably doing it wrong.
[3494.70 → 3497.70] You want to talk us through this one, Luke?
[3497.76 → 3498.24] Sorry, again,
[3498.26 → 3499.60] I feel like I've talked a lot today.
[3499.70 → 3500.00] My bad.
[3500.84 → 3501.28] It's,
[3501.36 → 3502.30] it's the
[3502.34 → 3503.76] the main thing for me is the
[3504.06 → 3506.56] what you're potentially maybe getting from it,
[3506.88 → 3508.02] the paid subscriptions.
[3508.58 → 3510.64] So the ability to use tweet deck,
[3511.24 → 3512.16] Twitter for business,
[3512.34 → 3513.56] creator focus dashboard,
[3513.70 → 3513.98] et cetera,
[3514.30 → 3516.20] advanced features like unsending messages,
[3516.20 → 3518.56] or this is honestly,
[3518.56 → 3520.34] I think where they're just going to get like
[3520.34 → 3522.90] every company and fresh professional person,
[3522.90 → 3525.10] like ever is editing tweets.
[3525.72 → 3526.04] Um,
[3526.04 → 3528.28] I saw some tweets talking about this.
[3528.44 → 3529.24] I'd pay for that.
[3529.72 → 3530.16] Yeah.
[3530.40 → 3531.92] And so many people would.
[3532.06 → 3532.56] And if,
[3532.68 → 3534.20] especially if it's like five bucks a month,
[3534.46 → 3535.34] the like standard,
[3535.54 → 3537.80] this is a subscription on the internet fee.
[3537.96 → 3538.30] Yeah.
[3538.36 → 3538.92] Um,
[3539.10 → 3539.88] they're just going to get,
[3540.06 → 3541.92] they're going to get every company.
[3541.92 → 3544.06] They're going to get every professional public.
[3544.06 → 3545.02] Every influencer.
[3545.02 → 3545.58] I'd pay,
[3545.68 → 3546.64] I'd pay more than five bucks.
[3546.86 → 3548.68] They're going to get everybody who thinks
[3548.68 → 3550.04] they want to be an influencer.
[3550.04 → 3553.38] They're going to be everyone who they're going to get aspirational.
[3553.38 → 3554.38] They're going to get everything.
[3554.52 → 3554.78] Yeah.
[3554.84 → 3555.10] Um,
[3555.10 → 3557.24] and it's going to be because of that editing tweets thing.
[3557.24 → 3557.44] Like,
[3557.48 → 3557.60] yeah,
[3557.60 → 3557.86] okay,
[3557.86 → 3558.14] sure.
[3558.36 → 3560.14] Consumer features like custom colours,
[3560.52 → 3561.12] hashtags,
[3561.56 → 3562.64] whatever stickers,
[3562.64 → 3563.22] uh,
[3563.22 → 3564.36] the ability to remove ads,
[3564.44 → 3565.58] higher quality video,
[3565.58 → 3566.50] better and more depth,
[3566.72 → 3568.88] better and more in-depth analytics.
[3568.88 → 3572.20] So I think they'll get people on the better and more in-depth analytics.
[3572.20 → 3574.66] So everybody loves that higher quality video,
[3574.66 → 3575.60] your brands,
[3575.70 → 3576.24] your influencers,
[3576.46 → 3577.46] whatever are going to want that.
[3577.48 → 3578.02] We pay for that.
[3578.02 → 3579.12] And editing tweets,
[3579.26 → 3580.10] the rest of it.
[3581.54 → 3582.26] I don't know.
[3582.54 → 3582.86] Whatever.
[3583.20 → 3583.40] Sure.
[3583.62 → 3583.86] Cool.
[3584.08 → 3586.40] But those three things are like primo.
[3586.84 → 3587.38] That's the
[3587.50 → 3587.86] they will,
[3588.02 → 3591.50] this whole thing works entirely on the back of those things.
[3591.64 → 3593.52] I don't think people are even going to complain.
[3593.74 → 3595.80] I think people are going to welcome this with open arms.
[3596.00 → 3596.30] I mean,
[3596.32 → 3597.82] did you even mention these other ideas,
[3597.92 → 3599.32] the ability to tip other users?
[3599.44 → 3599.64] I mean,
[3599.70 → 3601.96] Reddit has turned that into a gold mine.
[3603.66 → 3604.22] Get it.
[3604.28 → 3604.46] Yeah.
[3604.58 → 3604.90] And honestly,
[3605.14 → 3605.62] especially get it.
[3605.86 → 3606.16] Get it.
[3606.16 → 3607.44] Okay.
[3607.66 → 3607.86] Yeah,
[3607.92 → 3608.42] that is good.
[3610.08 → 3613.86] I think with the kind of brigadier that goes on Twitter as well,
[3613.86 → 3615.64] I could see that being pretty huge.
[3615.64 → 3621.40] It could be like positive brigadier at a certain point and subscribing or paying users for exclusive content.
[3621.40 → 3622.26] That could be,
[3622.26 → 3623.16] this is a
[3623.16 → 3624.80] that could be a massive,
[3624.80 → 3627.20] like why bother going over to only fans?
[3627.40 → 3630.88] If you could just run the entire thing through your Twitter account.
[3631.00 → 3635.84] So many only fans influencers already use Twitter as their primary means of exposure.
[3636.28 → 3637.00] And they have,
[3637.00 → 3638.86] not really,
[3639.02 → 3641.52] but they have live streams.
[3641.64 → 3644.94] They have video, and they have photo, and they have text all under the roof.
[3644.94 → 3646.04] And if you can make it exclusive,
[3646.16 → 3646.62] that's huge.
[3646.78 → 3647.06] Yeah.
[3648.36 → 3649.86] Or they could just go on flow plane.
[3650.02 → 3650.42] Hey,
[3650.78 → 3651.98] at this point,
[3652.02 → 3652.94] at this point we'd take them,
[3652.98 → 3653.30] I think.
[3655.02 → 3655.38] Well,
[3655.38 → 3657.28] I know it was something we talked about in the early days.
[3657.28 → 3657.72] We were like,
[3657.76 → 3658.18] Oh yeah.
[3658.28 → 3658.58] You know,
[3658.58 → 3659.16] I don't know.
[3659.24 → 3659.72] I don't know.
[3659.82 → 3660.56] Would we like,
[3660.64 → 3660.86] you know,
[3660.90 → 3663.24] would we want content or whatever?
[3664.00 → 3666.16] It depends on the type of,
[3666.16 → 3668.80] of that content that they do.
[3669.18 → 3670.06] We might have,
[3670.28 → 3670.70] this is,
[3670.82 → 3672.10] I'm just talking to the audience.
[3672.22 → 3673.00] Linus knows all this.
[3673.32 → 3675.88] We would potentially have a payment processor issues.
[3675.94 → 3679.24] That was the main reason we didn't actually like lean into that.
[3679.24 → 3683.80] Cause like neither Luke nor I really feel like we're the judge of what you want to upload.
[3684.56 → 3684.96] Yeah.
[3685.32 → 3685.76] Whatever.
[3686.02 → 3686.14] Yeah.
[3686.20 → 3686.50] Whatever.
[3686.82 → 3688.36] But watch it or be interested,
[3688.60 → 3690.58] but we might not have been able to take payment.
[3690.86 → 3692.00] So that might've been an issue.
[3692.28 → 3692.68] Yeah.
[3692.68 → 3699.42] So you'll notice standard payment processors that you're used to seeing will exist on sites
[3699.42 → 3701.54] that even if there is lewd content,
[3701.84 → 3702.98] it's artistic.
[3703.26 → 3703.68] Yeah.
[3704.06 → 3705.40] That includes art.
[3705.44 → 3706.54] That includes cosplay.
[3706.54 → 3707.88] That includes a bunch of different things,
[3707.98 → 3708.92] but it has to be artistic.
[3709.78 → 3710.98] If it's not artistic,
[3710.98 → 3714.26] you'll find that it doesn't have your like standard payment processors.
[3714.78 → 3715.08] Yeah.
[3715.70 → 3716.70] Just random little tidbit.
[3716.76 → 3717.20] I don't know.
[3717.32 → 3717.54] Art.
[3717.72 → 3718.28] What is art?
[3718.44 → 3721.46] I think you can kind of make the argument that just about anything is art.
[3721.56 → 3721.92] Yeah.
[3721.92 → 3723.06] It's yeah.
[3723.62 → 3725.02] What pretty wide definition.
[3726.24 → 3726.62] All right.
[3726.92 → 3730.90] And I think for our last topic for the day is Intel CPUs.
[3730.90 → 3732.98] You can afford and actually buy.
[3733.22 → 3734.96] This was put in by one of our new writers.
[3734.96 → 3736.36] So it sources video cards.
[3736.98 → 3739.60] Intel is reducing prices on 10th gen core CPUs.
[3739.60 → 3742.12] I guess rocket lake must be coming pretty soon.
[3742.12 → 3745.56] And it looks like it's anywhere from 10 to 22% across existing models.
[3745.56 → 3746.54] So the 10,
[3746.54 → 3746.56] 10,
[3746.56 → 3750.96] 600 KF had gone from 309 to 242.
[3753.36 → 3754.88] And it's not just in Poland.
[3755.02 → 3755.38] Apparently.
[3755.50 → 3755.72] Okay.
[3755.72 → 3756.84] Apparently this was,
[3756.84 → 3757.28] uh,
[3757.28 → 3758.96] it started showing up in Poland.
[3758.96 → 3759.66] Uh,
[3759.66 → 3763.74] Amazon.com is listing a two 29 flat price for the
[3763.74 → 3764.26] yeah,
[3764.26 → 3764.68] for the 10,
[3764.74 → 3765.44] 600 KF.
[3765.80 → 3766.80] So that's six cores.
[3767.06 → 3769.30] I believe that's only six threads.
[3769.36 → 3769.48] Nope.
[3769.52 → 3770.94] That's a 12 thread processor.
[3771.12 → 3774.04] So that's pretty darn slick for gaming.
[3774.04 → 3775.62] If you're into that sort of thing,
[3775.62 → 3776.92] uh,
[3776.92 → 3778.72] regional stock varies from chip to chip,
[3778.72 → 3779.24] but,
[3779.24 → 3781.12] um,
[3781.12 → 3786.06] in light of AMD's struggles to produce enough Zen three CPUs,
[3786.06 → 3788.14] this is looking like a pretty good play for Intel.
[3788.46 → 3789.82] And we actually saw,
[3789.94 → 3791.34] you're going to see this in the average,
[3791.34 → 3791.74] uh,
[3791.74 → 3792.38] steam PC,
[3792.38 → 3793.46] uh,
[3793.48 → 3794.82] video that's coming up this weekend.
[3794.82 → 3799.32] We noticed that Intel actually clawed back some market share in the last month.
[3799.34 → 3804.52] And that seems to be basically down to the fact that you simply cannot buy an AMD CPU right now.
[3805.04 → 3805.28] Uh,
[3805.28 → 3806.50] not because necessarily,
[3806.50 → 3807.16] uh,
[3807.16 → 3808.92] people are choosing Intel by choice.
[3808.92 → 3809.50] It's just that,
[3809.58 → 3809.64] Hey,
[3809.66 → 3810.54] if you want to upgrade,
[3810.54 → 3811.40] you are,
[3811.48 → 3814.86] you're pretty much either waiting or you're going Intel at the moment.
[3817.02 → 3817.50] Yeah.
[3818.30 → 3818.78] It's,
[3818.86 → 3819.12] it's,
[3819.16 → 3819.50] I mean,
[3819.54 → 3823.46] it's interesting having this happen and the NVIDIA,
[3823.46 → 3824.22] uh,
[3824.22 → 3827.02] 1050 TI thing happening at a pretty similar time.
[3827.94 → 3828.38] The
[3828.58 → 3829.42] there,
[3829.50 → 3833.54] there's been a lot of memes going around about the like complete inability for people to more or less buy,
[3833.54 → 3834.46] uh,
[3834.70 → 3835.04] parts.
[3835.14 → 3836.08] I saw something,
[3836.16 → 3839.80] I don't remember where it was posted talking about how like a thousand dollars in 2019.
[3839.80 → 3840.40] Yeah.
[3840.40 → 3841.68] Like I can buy a
[3841.68 → 3844.84] a decent gaming computer and a thousand dollars in,
[3844.84 → 3845.70] in 2021.
[3845.70 → 3846.38] I can buy an Xbox.
[3846.92 → 3847.52] I might,
[3847.52 → 3850.80] I might be able to buy a graphics card.
[3850.88 → 3851.20] Maybe.
[3851.38 → 3852.16] If you can find one.
[3852.18 → 3852.48] So yeah,
[3852.84 → 3853.06] this,
[3853.12 → 3853.78] this is cool.
[3853.92 → 3854.14] It's,
[3854.22 → 3854.62] I mean,
[3854.62 → 3857.74] one of these chips and a
[3857.74 → 3858.60] and a 1050 TI,
[3858.70 → 3861.38] you're not going to be flying over the moon,
[3861.38 → 3864.02] but at least people can get a setup.
[3864.02 → 3865.12] That's like decently solved.
[3865.12 → 3866.06] I can play modern games.
[3866.42 → 3866.68] So,
[3866.68 → 3867.22] um,
[3867.22 → 3868.72] messes own asks,
[3868.72 → 3872.76] would float plane consider doing a deal with curiosity stream?
[3873.02 → 3874.88] I don't understand what that deal would mean.
[3874.94 → 3876.24] What's wrong with curiosity stream?
[3876.36 → 3877.46] Are they not doing okay?
[3878.56 → 3878.68] I,
[3878.88 → 3879.10] yeah.
[3879.20 → 3880.80] I think everything's fine.
[3880.94 → 3882.56] I think they're definitely more than fine.
[3882.66 → 3882.76] Yeah.
[3882.76 → 3883.44] I don't see any news.
[3883.52 → 3884.40] I think I'm pretty sure they're,
[3884.46 → 3885.78] I'm pretty sure they're doing great on their own.
[3885.78 → 3888.34] I had one chat I wanted to reply to from earlier.
[3889.22 → 3889.66] Um,
[3890.72 → 3892.30] this is a perfect pro tip.
[3892.38 → 3896.40] This is from Ben snow replying to Samuel.
[3896.52 → 3897.38] I think this was on float plane.
[3897.80 → 3898.28] Um,
[3898.32 → 3899.50] same rig here and nope,
[3899.58 → 3900.10] def not today.
[3900.18 → 3900.28] Okay.
[3900.28 → 3900.98] I don't know what that's about.
[3901.08 → 3902.52] If you want more performance,
[3902.70 → 3904.24] like if you're up trying to upgrade today,
[3904.52 → 3906.30] subscribe to G force now is premium tier.
[3906.38 → 3907.08] And just wait it out.
[3908.02 → 3908.96] What a pro tip.
[3909.44 → 3910.14] That's like,
[3910.80 → 3911.62] that's the
[3911.70 → 3912.28] that's the
[3912.44 → 3914.32] that's the big brain move right now.
[3914.32 → 3916.52] If you can't buy a gaming machine,
[3916.62 → 3917.84] just don't buy a gaming machine.
[3918.36 → 3919.46] Use a cloud gaming machine.
[3919.58 → 3919.76] Yeah.
[3919.86 → 3920.06] Okay.
[3920.06 → 3920.58] It's not as,
[3920.72 → 3921.44] it's not as great.
[3921.54 → 3922.36] It's latency,
[3922.66 → 3923.20] whatever,
[3923.82 → 3924.22] but.
[3924.30 → 3927.02] So Linus is going to be the profit of the end times.
[3927.88 → 3928.26] Sorry.
[3928.32 → 3928.90] What is this?
[3929.42 → 3932.86] Linus is going to be the one that brings people to stop buying hardware.
[3933.08 → 3933.48] No,
[3933.72 → 3933.90] no,
[3934.06 → 3934.58] no,
[3934.74 → 3935.20] no.
[3935.20 → 3935.98] You just said it.
[3936.14 → 3936.68] You just said,
[3936.76 → 3937.92] if you can't get a PC right now,
[3937.98 → 3938.60] just subscribe.
[3938.74 → 3940.04] If you can't,
[3940.26 → 3941.78] if you can't,
[3941.82 → 3942.10] I'm not.
[3942.10 → 3942.90] I'm going to choose a hat.
[3943.20 → 3943.38] Maybe,
[3943.38 → 3950.00] maybe all these GPU supply issues is just Nvidia trying to get us to subscribe to their service instead of buy hardware.
[3950.18 → 3950.30] Well,
[3950.32 → 3952.10] how do you explain AMD shortage?
[3953.00 → 3953.48] So they just,
[3953.64 → 3953.90] you know,
[3954.00 → 3954.72] it's just AMD.
[3955.10 → 3955.28] Oh,
[3955.36 → 3955.70] wow.
[3955.94 → 3956.42] Oh,
[3956.60 → 3957.06] wow.
[3957.80 → 3959.14] That shade though.
[3959.26 → 3960.02] That shade.
[3960.56 → 3961.90] You got so much shade.
[3962.02 → 3963.70] Like I can't even like,
[3963.74 → 3964.18] look at this.
[3964.24 → 3965.22] Look at all this shade.
[3966.80 → 3967.66] I'm shaded.
[3967.66 → 3968.66] Um,
[3970.86 → 3972.44] all right.
[3972.50 → 3972.66] Yeah,
[3972.66 → 3972.88] I don't know.
[3972.92 → 3973.70] That's not a bad idea.
[3973.96 → 3974.98] Weather the storm a bit.
[3975.14 → 3975.40] Yeah.
[3975.80 → 3976.84] It's totally a good idea.
[3977.56 → 3977.78] Yeah.
[3978.18 → 3978.58] Uh,
[3978.58 → 3979.04] all right.
[3979.18 → 3980.70] True neighbourhood watch says,
[3980.78 → 3981.04] uh,
[3981.04 → 3982.10] you already gave a shout-out once.
[3982.12 → 3982.94] So no need for another.
[3983.06 → 3983.28] Oh,
[3983.32 → 3983.56] oops.
[3983.70 → 3983.98] Okay.
[3984.40 → 3984.70] Uh,
[3984.70 → 3986.04] thanks for being an inspiration.
[3986.20 → 3988.34] YouTube's algorithm makes it hard for small timers.
[3988.58 → 3991.30] It makes it both harder and easier than ever.
[3991.98 → 3992.26] Uh,
[3992.30 → 3993.20] Carson asks,
[3993.28 → 3997.98] how's LTT store doing pre-pandemic versus now LTT store has been banging.
[3998.24 → 3999.24] So to speak,
[3999.24 → 4000.16] uh,
[4000.26 → 4000.86] trotting wolf says,
[4000.94 → 4002.24] got the CPU pillow last week.
[4002.40 → 4006.68] First thing my girlfriend did when she saw it was rubbed her feet on the carpet and stick her finger out to zap it.
[4006.68 → 4007.50] I love her.
[4010.40 → 4011.12] All right.
[4011.70 → 4012.40] All right.
[4012.46 → 4013.18] I hear that.
[4013.52 → 4013.90] Uh,
[4013.90 → 4014.12] okay.
[4014.12 → 4015.02] Just a couple more.
[4015.38 → 4015.66] Uh,
[4015.66 → 4026.74] Nathan really hit me how bad the shortage was when I listed a 1660 super on eBay this week with bids starting at 180 pounds and had offers for 280 to 300 for buy it now within minutes.
[4027.68 → 4028.12] Yeah,
[4028.28 → 4029.04] pretty much.
[4029.12 → 4031.44] There are no GPUs out there.
[4032.64 → 4033.12] So,
[4033.32 → 4033.48] Oh,
[4033.82 → 4034.40] George says,
[4034.46 → 4036.26] I heard there was a video for the winter one on the way.
[4036.32 → 4036.84] Any update?
[4037.36 → 4037.58] Yeah.
[4037.64 → 4041.00] So what happened was we had some staffing changes,
[4041.16 → 4041.30] blah,
[4041.34 → 4041.46] blah,
[4041.56 → 4041.86] blah.
[4042.06 → 4043.00] We're working on it.
[4043.00 → 4043.86] It'll get done eventually.
[4044.12 → 4046.72] Thanks guys.
[4046.84 → 4046.96] Oh,
[4047.00 → 4050.84] apparently 5800X and 5600X have been in stock the last few days.
[4050.90 → 4052.90] US Amazon and the AMD website.
[4053.38 → 4054.02] Hold on a second.
[4054.10 → 4055.24] Can I just double-check that?
[4055.74 → 4056.94] Because 5800X,
[4056.94 → 4057.42] that's a
[4057.46 → 4058.76] that's a darn fine.
[4058.76 → 4062.34] That's a darn fine enthusiast tier CPU right about these days.
[4062.48 → 4062.98] By the way,
[4063.04 → 4063.26] Luke,
[4063.30 → 4064.26] I have good news for you.
[4064.74 → 4065.10] Uh,
[4065.10 → 4068.16] I finally got a CPU for your rig upgrade.
[4068.68 → 4071.32] Luke's been bugging me to give him a free computer for a long time.
[4071.32 → 4073.30] Because I used to give him free computers all the time.
[4073.30 → 4075.04] And now he doesn't have any free computers.
[4075.04 → 4076.68] Because he's busy making flow plane.
[4077.30 → 4077.60] Um,
[4077.60 → 4081.52] so the last personal rig update we did for Luke was like three or four years ago.
[4081.84 → 4083.84] I think it's been a while.
[4084.04 → 4084.40] Yeah.
[4084.40 → 4089.14] We actually had a viewer offer me a 5950X for your rig update.
[4089.92 → 4090.94] 16 cores,
[4091.28 → 4092.20] 16 cores,
[4092.32 → 4093.24] 32 threads,
[4093.34 → 4093.66] baby.
[4094.28 → 4095.48] But with a catch.
[4096.04 → 4096.30] Okay.
[4096.30 → 4096.64] Okay.
[4096.70 → 4097.32] With a catch.
[4097.44 → 4097.64] Okay.
[4097.70 → 4100.12] So you know how I had said what we could do for you,
[4100.36 → 4102.78] given you're not really minus media group staff,
[4102.84 → 4105.98] what we could do for you is like a hand-me-down machine.
[4106.06 → 4106.32] Okay.
[4106.98 → 4110.28] So this is going to be the greatest hand-me-down machine of all time.
[4110.28 → 4115.00] Because I've got that As rock X570 water-cooled board that I pulled out of my rig.
[4115.06 → 4116.38] So I'll hand that down to you.
[4116.38 → 4116.56] Okay.
[4117.04 → 4118.46] Casual thousand dollar motherboard.
[4118.74 → 4123.92] And then we've got a 5950X from a viewer and there's only one catch.
[4124.00 → 4124.88] It's missing a pin.
[4125.66 → 4127.58] So you're going to have to repair it.
[4128.04 → 4129.86] You're going to have to put a new pin on it.
[4129.92 → 4130.22] Okay.
[4130.62 → 4131.06] So,
[4131.58 → 4132.00] um,
[4132.22 → 4136.68] you have a great processor that doesn't work,
[4137.12 → 4137.76] but we're going to,
[4137.82 → 4138.70] we're going to,
[4138.70 → 4140.34] we're going to do a classic one for you guys.
[4140.38 → 4140.62] Okay.
[4140.94 → 4142.68] Linus and Luke build a computer together.
[4143.12 → 4143.56] Uh,
[4143.56 → 4144.48] it's going to be a good video.
[4144.52 → 4145.78] We're going to fix up that CPU.
[4145.92 → 4146.94] We're going to get that thing running.
[4146.98 → 4147.68] It's going to be great.
[4147.90 → 4148.50] It's going to be great.
[4149.22 → 4149.96] So that's,
[4150.00 → 4151.60] that's it for the WAN show for today.
[4151.74 → 4153.12] Thank you very much.
[4153.12 → 4154.30] You guys for tuning in,
[4154.36 → 4156.36] go buy something at LTT store.com.
[4156.56 → 4157.06] You know,
[4157.06 → 4157.60] we got to,
[4157.92 → 4158.58] got to keep,
[4159.02 → 4159.62] keep the
[4159.62 → 4160.70] keep the dream alive.
[4160.70 → 4161.28] We've got,
[4161.38 → 4161.64] Oh yeah,
[4161.64 → 4162.68] we've got some good stuff.
[4162.76 → 4164.68] We've got storage and Ram scarves.
[4164.82 → 4166.16] You guys can check these out.
[4166.22 → 4166.94] Tech scarves.
[4166.94 → 4167.58] Uh,
[4167.58 → 4169.92] we've got our boxers in stock.
[4170.08 → 4170.74] Of course,
[4170.74 → 4171.84] we've got CPU pillows.
[4172.12 → 4173.58] We've got the toques.
[4173.70 → 4174.28] We've got,
[4174.28 → 4174.72] uh,
[4174.72 → 4175.52] water bottles.
[4176.20 → 4176.64] Um,
[4177.74 → 4179.84] and what's a stealth pin CPU shirt.
[4179.94 → 4180.64] Very popular.
[4180.82 → 4181.16] All right.
[4181.18 → 4181.90] Go check it out.
