[0.00 → 7.08] um I think it's supposed to be live
[7.08 → 16.22] is it we don't know welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic
[16.22 → 22.18] show for you today yes there are tons of good news there is good news GPUs they're finally
[22.18 → 26.56] coming down in price but okay I don't know if this is good news depending on who you
[26.56 → 33.40] are because it's all caused by a big cryptocurrency crackdown in Ariana I was trying to i was trying
[33.40 → 40.08] to get that alliteration going cryptocurrency crackdown in China it's okay it's close enough
[40.08 → 47.92] also there is a big right to repair executive order that is being cracked down in the united
[47.92 → 54.90] states of America so that's really exciting for a lot of electronics enthusiasts even though it's
[54.90 → 61.54] not necessarily directly applicable to us what else we got today other good news the Google play
[61.54 → 68.64] store is under fire that's fantastic also uh there's somewhat is this by the way uh what is what
[68.64 → 76.22] oh my new house challenges yeah um it's like bold and highlighted in red so it sounds like an exciting
[76.22 → 82.96] topic but I don't know what it is i it's there are a lot of challenges there are challenges with the new
[82.96 → 89.50] house okay so for anyone who knows smart thermostats all right here's a preview for the challenges
[89.50 → 97.32] every thermostat in the house has only two conductors to it so if you know smart thermostats you know that
[97.32 → 102.78] could be problematic for me all right let's go ahead and roll that intro okay
[102.78 → 126.18] and the show is brought to you today by
[126.18 → 137.42] display fusion need for seat and see sonic that's right good stuff all right why don't we jump right
[137.42 → 146.96] into our first topic of the day GPU prices finally, finally starting to stabilize like I said they would
[146.96 → 154.58] uh after multiple crackdowns by the Chinese government crypto prices have been tanking and as they do, they've
[154.58 → 162.84] been bringing GPU prices right down with them so china's ongoing fight against crypto um on account of
[162.84 → 168.34] well a power consumption and environmental concerns ha ha ha I think so ha ha just kidding
[168.34 → 173.46] uh I mean they are concerns it can put a significant load on the power grid but I think the bigger one is
[173.46 → 181.34] that this is something that the CCP cannot control and so obviously they're not a big fan of that so
[181.34 → 186.64] their ongoing fight against crypto has resulted in mining firms shutting down altogether in some cases
[186.64 → 193.58] either by government order or fear of prosecution so as a result miners are trying to claw back some of
[193.58 → 199.78] what they paid for their now useless mining cards so here is where the gamers kind of get to do a victory lap
[199.78 → 209.10] because I'll let you guys in on a little secret when GPU prices are hyperinflated miners also have to pay
[209.10 → 216.20] hyperinflated pricing so when they don't get a return on that investment ultimately that is right
[216.20 → 224.52] out of the pocket of miners so hey this is it's its like what I said would happen eventually the
[224.52 → 231.46] tables will turn and gamers will be benefiting from cheap GPUs and miners will be losing money in fact
[231.46 → 237.48] so many used GPUs are flooding the market that used pricing has come down not just to MSRP
[237.48 → 245.74] but even dipped below due to the sheer excess in supply now that's not everywhere okay region by
[245.74 → 253.48] region pricing has been behaving differently and in North America there have been dips but not to the
[253.48 → 261.20] same extent as what they've seen in China, so the good news though is that if miners are selling
[261.20 → 267.30] rather than buying that is going to have a trickle-down effect on other regions so think about it this
[267.30 → 272.82] way right there's a there are a number of wafers right that NVIDIA has booked they're going to make
[272.82 → 279.66] x number of GPUs come hell or high water because they actually have to book this stuff months or in
[279.66 → 286.00] some cases even years in advance in order to get allocation from TSMC or Samsung or any of the
[286.00 → 293.78] fabs that still exists um so what happens then is they've got this fixed amount that they have to
[293.78 → 300.24] they have to build now what you would normally see and this is NVIDIA's typical go-to-market strategy
[300.24 → 306.26] is they would start with the highest uh margin silicon so that's going to be their professional
[306.26 → 312.72] products like their tesla cards their uh I guess they don't call them squadron anymore so I don't know
[312.72 → 319.44] a series RTX a series um and then of course their high-end consumer and prosumer cards like you know
[319.44 → 324.98] your titans they don't have a titan right now but you guys get the point your titans your RTX 80s and
[324.98 → 331.14] 90s stuff like that then what happens is the demand for those starts to taper off a little bit because
[331.14 → 336.92] believe it or not there's a finite number of people in the world that need a 1500 graphics card
[336.92 → 342.08] eventually they will just all have one, and you got to start making stuff that is a little bit more
[342.08 → 347.84] affordable so they take that they take that wafer and instead of slicing it up it, you know into let's
[347.84 → 354.58] say 100 pieces they'll slice it up into 500 pieces and these are smaller uh less performant GPUs and
[354.58 → 359.30] then they go, and they integrate those into cards and that's going to be your you know your 60 series
[359.30 → 365.64] or your 50 ti or whatever the case may be that just kind of didn't happen this time around because
[365.64 → 371.92] there was absolutely no incentive to do it whatsoever, so there was no pressure in fact there was upward
[371.92 → 380.80] pressure on pricing because there was just this utterly unmeetable demand for these high-end GPUs
[380.80 → 387.98] so what's happening here now is we're seeing that so right that's what's normally supposed to make
[387.98 → 393.72] GPUs more affordable is they've got to ultimately produce GPUs, and they're going to produce these more
[393.72 → 399.46] affordable ones in order to hit the mass market so they can sell way way way more volume of them even
[399.46 → 405.30] if it's at a lower margin so now we're seeing a bit of a different effect on what's going to happen
[405.30 → 412.34] to GPU pricing so instead of miners in China buying these GPUs they are now selling them so what that
[412.34 → 418.62] means is all these GPUs that remember guys they're making anyway because it's their not that nimble
[418.62 → 425.82] they can't just on a dime go oh crypto fell today yeah crypto fell today so we're going to make
[425.82 → 433.04] 30 30 we're going to make a 30 50 instead it takes a little while to ramp these things up so what's
[433.04 → 439.00] going to happen is they're going to have this glut of chips and that's not a huge problem you know
[439.00 → 444.94] a company like NVIDIA has enough cash on hand that they can have a build-up of supply for a
[444.94 → 449.42] little bit, and they can just they can just hold that right that's not going to put an enormous financial
[449.42 → 455.58] strain on them, but it might look bad on their books so you might start to see them go okay we need to
[455.58 → 459.86] get a little bit more aggressive so they might start to bring back things like game bundles so
[459.86 → 466.98] they can increase sales to alleviate some of that some of that excess supply and that's a global thing
[466.98 → 473.30] so even though the supply might only be excess in China where people are going to start buying these
[473.30 → 480.06] used GPUs instead of buying new ones that's going to affect their overall supply of these GPUs, and it's
[480.06 → 482.96] going to mean that they have to get more creative about moving them elsewhere in the world
[482.96 → 489.10] and it's going to be a delayed reaction because it takes time, but we should see pricing start to go
[489.10 → 494.64] down around the world that was not the best explanation of how these different pressures
[494.64 → 503.20] affect each other but whatever this is live and I'm doing my best you guys believe me I'm doing my best
[503.20 → 510.74] um so blah blah blah blah blah blah oh yeah it hasn't completely it's like prices are going to be coming
[510.74 → 515.52] down we've already seen them coming down a little bit locally we still have 30 70s up on Craigslist
[515.52 → 522.12] for like 1600 dollars yeah um so we're not out of the woods yet but that's another leg though that's
[522.12 → 527.62] another leg that I didn't talk about so remember how NVIDIA might have this pressure from holding
[527.62 → 532.98] inventory, and they're going to try and pull every lever other than dropping the price before they pull
[532.98 → 538.74] dropping the price right so you want to get game bundles, or you want to do shipping offers, or you want to
[538.74 → 544.32] do combo deals are a big one manufacturer's love because they can provide an incentive to the
[544.32 → 548.92] user to buy, but they don't actually have to drop the price and make whoever bought it yesterday feel
[548.92 → 555.84] like a big sucker right so they'll, they want to pull all these other levers so any local seller is
[555.84 → 559.50] going to hope they can find someone who doesn't know prices are going down they're going to pull
[559.50 → 565.74] every lever they can other than dropping the price and that's why online marketplaces like an eBay
[565.74 → 571.52] for example will tend to show they'll tend to reflect this downward pricing pressure faster
[571.52 → 579.00] than something like a Craigslist where you might have a less um in tune clientele that's the
[579.00 → 583.68] same reason why you might walk into like a little mom-and-pop computer shop, and they'll have some GPU from
[583.68 → 590.82] two generations ago sitting on the shelf for what the MSRP was four years ago right so if they're the
[590.82 → 597.54] only computer shop in Vernon bc or something like that and someone desperately needs a GPU because
[597.54 → 601.92] they were at a LAN, and they can't play any video games, and they don't they can't get overnight
[601.92 → 606.68] shipping, and they're going to miss out or whatever they might buy it right so the more limited your
[606.68 → 611.98] buyers options are uh the better the chance that you can keep your price high so we're going to see
[611.98 → 620.76] this downward pressure, but it is going to take some time um yeah we've also got people in the
[620.76 → 627.06] chat saying that they've seen eBay prices go down um like eBay listings go down in price by the day
[627.06 → 630.78] over the last little bit so that's pretty interesting yep you'll also see a lot of sellers that are going
[630.78 → 635.58] to try and pull their listings and not let them sell at a lower price to try to try to prop it up
[635.58 → 640.30] try to prop it up try and make people think that the that there's oh there's still really high demand
[640.30 → 645.96] not enough supply but don't fall for it right now today right probably the worst time to buy a GPU in
[645.96 → 651.00] the last two years because at least if you bought a GPU six months ago, and you paid an obscene price
[651.00 → 656.02] for it, you could have been mining Ethereum on it overnight like over the course of the winter and
[656.02 → 663.58] made back a ton of that money assuming you sold um anyway I'm just saying right now while when that GPU
[663.58 → 670.46] is gonna it's kind of like buying a new car that's like you know it's about to suffer some
[670.46 → 676.52] kind of catastrophic recall or something that's going to tank its value so when you drive off the lot
[676.52 → 683.10] you don't lose 10 you lose like 40 of its value don't buy a GPU today especially not at scalper prices
[683.10 → 691.74] because it's coming guys it's finally happening um so okay, okay you know what Anthony's got some really
[691.74 → 698.38] great notes in here apparently the uh the energy factor of cryptocurrency is plays a larger role
[698.38 → 704.58] than I realized, and they are facing a energy crisis right now with ongoing rolling blackouts
[704.58 → 709.86] now I did kind of roll my eyes when I talked about environmental concerns I still am not convinced that
[709.86 → 715.20] they care that much about that but I mean not having people's houses and businesses have power that's
[715.20 → 720.92] definitely a big problem yes for sure Chinese authorities are placing the blame primarily on exceptionally high
[720.92 → 726.22] demand as well as routine maintenance and this tracks with the crackdowns there's apparently a coal
[726.22 → 731.46] shortage as well combined with the reactivation of heavy industry as covid recovery picks up speed so
[731.46 → 737.52] it's seriously complicated the power situation uh likely they want to prioritize manufacturing over
[737.52 → 740.62] everything else keeping Chinese manufacturers afloat I could see that
[740.62 → 747.20] and yeah so that's pretty much it I mean it's all it's all good news Luke can you think of anything
[747.20 → 753.20] negative about GPU pricing getting back to normal I love it I'm I'm thrilled not for us yeah
[753.20 → 758.34] not for our section if you were heavily invested I could see this being a very
[758.34 → 764.00] frustrating time but um you had to know what was going to come though like hopefully there was a lot of
[764.00 → 769.74] writing on the wall yeah you know well there's writing on the wall every time I mean crypto boom bust
[769.74 → 774.96] boom bust boom bust now here's the question for you Luke though this is the big question
[774.96 → 780.96] actually no first I just want to say I'm so glad that my crystal ball still works because I got into
[780.96 → 786.22] I got into an argument with someone in YouTube comments which is a very stupid place to to to
[786.22 → 791.06] argue with people because you'll find all sorts there uh where they basically said no, no the crypto
[791.06 → 798.64] won't crash this time GPU pricing is never getting better and I'm like please it'll, it'll crash it'll get
[798.64 → 804.42] better yeah there you go it is what it is um so I was right my crystal ball still works which is
[804.42 → 807.72] fantastic now here's my question for you Luke
[807.72 → 818.90] yeah do you buy the dip this time personally no for crypto nope you're not going to buy any
[818.90 → 828.08] not personally are you I man it's tempting its tempting because there's just there's such
[828.08 → 837.08] there's this just amazing clear pattern of behaviour clear pattern of behaviour yes boom bust boom
[837.08 → 846.52] bust boom bust i just oh man I don't even I don't even know I don't even know i and i I see it too i just
[846.52 → 849.82] um
[849.82 → 856.62] I bought an apartment a few years ago and I find it very satisfying to pay it off
[856.62 → 863.92] ah so you're going with that you know what as investments go bc real estate ain't a bad one so
[863.92 → 870.54] far for you yeah, and it's very it's very like it's also I don't know I'm not a huge fan of like
[870.54 → 877.86] huge financial risk as you probably know and as the land show probably knows um so paying I believe
[877.86 → 884.84] the term is um yeah yeah there you go um paying off the place that you live in uh
[884.84 → 892.44] especially in this climate feels like a very uh like high return investment for one and then for two
[892.44 → 900.40] it is just it feels good feels safe my payments go down like if is I have a bad month which isn't
[900.40 → 907.28] really a thing that happens because I have um stable gainful employment um but if I was to for
[907.28 → 912.40] some reason it would be more comfortable you know for sure yeah I wouldn't have to like to sell off all
[912.40 → 919.28] these assets and stuff i just I'm okay I have my place I've put a lot of money into it, I can pull
[919.28 → 925.58] money out of it it's its just it's very stable and i I like that personally uh but I could if
[925.58 → 931.46] someone was to buy the dip um it would make a lot of sense to me, it's just not my plate personally
[931.46 → 937.90] not your jam not your jam yeah I get it I get it yeah um so the hookup just uh sent a message
[937.90 → 945.54] in the chat uh yo man i it's a miracle I saw this thing by the way um said did the shortage delay the
[945.54 → 951.34] production release of the next series will there be a 4080 before you can buy a 3080 at MSRP it's a
[951.34 → 955.60] perfect question, and it's one that people have been talking about a fair bit um realistically
[955.60 → 963.66] there's no way that the shortage delayed the r d of the upcoming NVIDIA and AMD GPUs I mean that's
[963.66 → 970.70] something that NVIDIA and AMD they're playing a game that is they're playing a game that it that
[970.70 → 977.36] is it's its on the order of years not on the order of you know how consumers think you know
[977.36 → 983.22] I'm buying an I'm buying a pc in two months you know that's about as far forward-thinking as
[983.22 → 988.64] most consumers are going to be, or they might think okay next generation consoles is sort of a
[988.64 → 993.88] best case scenario I could think of in terms of consumer planning um you know next generation consoles
[993.88 → 999.44] are coming next year you know I can see in one to two years yeah, yeah maybe I don't maybe I don't
[999.44 → 1003.56] buy a bunch of games for my current gen console though in the case of Microsoft I think
[1003.56 → 1008.26] they've done a pretty good job of uh you know forward and backward compatibility but maybe you
[1008.26 → 1012.00] don't get that like fancy new controller because you know there's going to be new controllers with
[1012.00 → 1015.94] the next exactly console version or whatever else you're not going to heavily invest in your current
[1015.94 → 1024.14] platform yeah exactly so um you know i I don't see it affecting r d, but we have seen in the past we
[1024.14 → 1030.12] have seen it affect the release schedules for products sure yeah absolutely because if NVIDIA
[1030.12 → 1035.28] can get you know if they're going to spend a billion dollars or whatever uh you know creating
[1035.28 → 1041.04] a next generation GPU architecture if they can make back four billion dollars instead of three and a half
[1041.04 → 1045.62] billion dollars or whatever the numbers work out to be if they can make another you know half a billion
[1045.62 → 1052.32] dollars on that investment why wouldn't they if there's absolutely no competitive reason for them to
[1052.32 → 1058.92] to release the next gen GPU now there are still reasons to keep releasing GPUs when you have
[1058.92 → 1065.88] no competition otherwise NVIDIA wouldn't have done it at all for quite a long period of time there um
[1065.88 → 1074.42] because they really just didn't have any competition but being able to resell to the same customer I mean
[1074.42 → 1080.38] that's what drove innovation in the computer space for so long being able to drive people on this
[1080.38 → 1085.94] you know yearly or bi-yearly or biyearly upgrade cycle I mean that's why basically no more than three
[1085.94 → 1091.90] there was even like fairly not super into tech families that I used to know that used to live
[1091.90 → 1096.52] on more or less a three-year cycle every three years they'd get a new family desktop exactly
[1096.52 → 1101.34] so there's two there's two kind of ways of looking at it on the one hand you want to get you want to reach
[1101.34 → 1106.10] as much saturation with each generation you invest in as possible to get the most out of that investment
[1106.10 → 1112.42] but the number two is you don't want to wait so long that your loyal customers who come and buy
[1112.42 → 1119.08] from you with this regular cadence just go and buy a mountain bike instead right because they're gonna
[1119.08 → 1123.78] if they have that kind of disposable income you want to capture it and if you don't come out with
[1123.78 → 1129.36] something new you're not going to capture it so both of those are factors that they have to
[1129.36 → 1134.00] consider so yeah I would say it could delay it I would be surprised if it delays it more than six months
[1134.00 → 1139.46] to a year though because NVIDIA wants to take those customers that run out and buy a 30 90
[1139.46 → 1145.40] or two 30 90s there's got to be a reason they kept SLI on that thing right those customers who buy that
[1145.40 → 1154.24] thing NVIDIA wants to sell them a 90 or two every time you know bring it on those are great
[1154.24 → 1161.06] customers from NVIDIA's perspective yeah i I guess that's probably I'm sure this term is used in more
[1161.06 → 1165.40] industries in the mobile gaming industry I'm sure that's like NVIDIA's whales is like the people
[1165.40 → 1171.70] that buy like a 90 or two every generation yeah you want to keep those whales happy dude yeah it's a
[1171.70 → 1178.14] good island it's a good island full of good people yeah yeah to keep whales happy all right so we got
[1178.14 → 1186.92] sorry it's terrible uh we're going to jump right into our next big topic here uh U.S. president joey b
[1186.92 → 1194.48] has signed a or is planning excuse me is planning on directing the FTC to create new right to repair
[1194.48 → 1199.20] rules that are primarily aimed at allowing members of the agricultural industry to more effectively
[1199.20 → 1207.42] repair their own equipment on site now this is one of those things where I feel like this is a good
[1207.42 → 1216.66] thing and I want to I want to applaud but instead I'm not going to applaud because it's not enough
[1216.66 → 1225.16] I'm just going to withhold my boo because it is terrible that this took so long it's terrible
[1225.16 → 1231.10] okay I'm going to applaud a little okay, okay yeah I'm going to applaud a little yes this you do
[1231.10 → 1236.98] have to cheer especially with rotating leadership you do have to cheer the eventual success of something
[1236.98 → 1243.74] i I totally do agree with you uh we talked about the john deer thing years ago yeah on wan show
[1243.74 → 1248.38] um it should this should have happened a very long time ago um the fact that you're not letting a
[1248.38 → 1254.64] like it's it seems like the do it you're like farmers must be very, very high on the do-it-yourself
[1254.64 → 1260.70] chain not letting them fix something themselves seems ridiculous and so the fact that this took so long
[1260.70 → 1266.10] is crazy I mean the fact that the fact that right to repair like this is something a lot of consumers
[1266.10 → 1272.48] even ones who oppose right to repair don't seem to understand or like maybe just nobody's ever
[1272.48 → 1277.70] explained it to them or they just never really like thought about it this way is right to repair
[1277.70 → 1285.54] already exists, and you already love it in the automotive industry this legislation that forces
[1285.54 → 1291.98] automotive manufacturers to support their products for a certain amount of time to create systems and
[1291.98 → 1300.04] networks of parts supply to independent repair shops this freaking legislation already exists and it
[1300.04 → 1307.78] already is a pure benefit to consumers it generates more competition, and it generates more consumer
[1307.78 → 1316.82] choice lowering prices that is what it's all about and so people who like maybe it's its just i I don't know
[1316.82 → 1321.98] what it is maybe for a lot of mainstream people they look at electronics, and they just go oh I don't
[1321.98 → 1328.74] know this is a mysterious it's a mysterious black mirror how could we possibly expect an independent
[1328.74 → 1335.70] repair shop to repair this correctly well if you don't provide any of the diagnostic tools and any of
[1335.70 → 1342.06] the diagrams they need you can't it's not reasonable but if you force them to do it like you do in the
[1342.06 → 1347.70] automotive industry then you can expect them to repair it just fine there's a lot of perfectly
[1347.70 → 1354.54] competent very smart steady-handed people that can absolutely repair just about anything about a cell
[1354.54 → 1360.00] phone other than a main board even some of them can do a bang up job of repairing things on main boards
[1360.00 → 1367.16] if manufacturers weren't intentionally putting barriers in place and so what I am hoping is that
[1367.16 → 1373.96] for those people that that kind of see electronics as like this black box that consumers and independent
[1373.96 → 1380.04] repair shop shouldn't be able to touch I'm hoping that this is a step in the right direction
[1380.04 → 1385.96] it's just it's mind-blowing to me that this took so long we've already got this for cars why was
[1385.96 → 1392.12] tractors such a long such a far step it feels like it would be the first one it feels like it would come
[1392.12 → 1399.36] before cars personally how did that how did this happen how is a car not just how excuse me how is a
[1399.36 → 1402.64] tractor not just a big heavy-duty car
[1402.64 → 1411.60] okay all right it's not it's not a little more away than that but yeah yeah I hear you
[1411.60 → 1416.76] but you guys understand what I mean like more accessible like those uh I don't know I don't want
[1416.76 → 1419.88] to get into this because I could be totally wrong but I was going to say they often have more accessible
[1419.88 → 1425.16] engine departments and stuff to that you would think are made that way so that they can be repaired
[1425.16 → 1431.96] more easily by the people using them um that always seemed true to me through observation I could be
[1431.96 → 1437.40] completely wrong but yeah I don't know it's the whole john deer thing is having seemed very weird to
[1437.40 → 1443.56] me the whole time the only thing that makes me sad about this whole uh situation is that it says
[1443.56 → 1449.24] primarily aimed uh at allowing members of the agriculture industry to more effectively repair their own
[1449.24 → 1453.64] equipment on site that's fantastic this is primarily aimed at that is it going to properly
[1453.64 → 1458.60] cover the rest probably not any, but that's concerning I'm hoping it's in the right direction
[1458.60 → 1462.84] yes, yes I hear that I just hope the next step doesn't take five years for those who aren't
[1462.84 → 1468.84] familiar with the john deer situation basically the equipment has been increasingly designed in such
[1468.84 → 1473.80] a way where many mechanical problems that used to be trivial to fix with tools and spare parts
[1473.80 → 1480.04] now require an authorized service technician and specialized software and john deer's justification
[1480.04 → 1485.40] for this is well it's so much more complex this is the new era of agriculture and smart
[1486.52 → 1494.36] no, no no, no no, no no, no you just want more money stop stop stop because there's absolutely no reason
[1495.08 → 1502.84] why you couldn't just create very cheap effective uh programs to train small shops or to train
[1502.84 → 1508.92] individual farmers on how to do this stuff themselves assuming that highly crafty farmers can't fix your
[1508.92 → 1516.20] more complex system uh is is is the wrong bet, and you're a jerk have you seen have you seen some of
[1516.20 → 1522.12] the high-tech farming videos on YouTube they're crazy actually they're really right good interesting
[1522.12 → 1527.88] rabbit hole they're really impressive right um yeah but like, and you know what if they can't fix it
[1527.88 → 1534.36] having a service uh that you can provide that can fix it for them uh if they're not technically
[1534.36 → 1542.84] able is great why not sure, but that's exactly where antitrust and anti-monopoly laws come in
[1542.84 → 1548.84] because you're not supposed to be able to lock out a competitor you're supposed to have to provide that
[1548.84 → 1553.96] or you're not you don't have to provide a service to fix your tractors I guess, but you're supposed to you
[1553.96 → 1559.72] should and when you provide that service you're not supposed to be able to take advantage of your
[1559.72 → 1564.60] position as a monopoly to push out any competition and jack up the prices, but that's what you're
[1564.60 → 1569.16] effectively doing if you're only if you're controlling your entire certification process
[1569.16 → 1574.20] and making it so that you're the only one who's allowed to touch it so according to a Bloomberg report
[1574.20 → 1579.24] the new set of rules that may be pushed is also expected to mention defence contractors and mobile
[1579.24 → 1583.80] phone manufacturers and will be aimed at combating measures that companies like apple and Microsoft
[1583.80 → 1588.84] have in place that actively work against consumer choice and repair we don't have any guarantee of
[1588.84 → 1596.60] any of that yet so the executive order is signed but I believe it just directs the FTC to create new
[1596.60 → 1602.44] rules um fascinating to see that the FTC is taking a bit more of a transparent approach to things
[1603.32 → 1610.92] it was fascinating reading the interviews um about that entire process they held their first like open
[1610.92 → 1619.48] open doors uh public meeting in like decades or something like that and uh some of the members
[1619.48 → 1626.44] were real upset about that it's like no actually consumers should know what the uh what the FTC is
[1626.44 → 1632.44] working on um it's like kind of the whole point uh the executive orders designed to do greater
[1632.44 → 1640.12] problem yeah yeah uh yeah so man I'd love I'd love to see this just medicine would be another
[1640.12 → 1646.92] space where like the amount of waste the amount of resource waste that ultimately gets passed along to
[1646.92 → 1654.68] the consumer that goes on in medicine uh especially in America man I feel for my American brothers out there
[1654.68 → 1663.80] you guys like imagine having a super expensive health care system like and still having to pay for
[1663.80 → 1671.00] it like I just don't I don't get it I don't get if it's it like it's mind-blowing it's mind-blowing to me
[1671.00 → 1680.12] um i I remember like my my my first sort of oh wow I'm you know I'm glad it's not like that here moment
[1680.12 → 1687.40] was my mom talking about a friend of hers uh from the states who had liked her arm was like kind of
[1687.40 → 1693.00] bent at a weird angle, and you know my mom had known her for a while and finally asked her she went like
[1693.80 → 1699.00] hey what is up with that and they kind of went oh well I broke my arm when I was a kid and
[1699.00 → 1707.64] my family couldn't afford to get it set and kind of like shrugged and my mom was like what are you
[1707.64 → 1715.88] kidding me to be clear our system not perfect absolutely not perfect but I mean the idea that
[1716.92 → 1723.48] you know I actually had an acquaintance of mine whose daughter's child was born with some
[1723.48 → 1730.36] horrifying condition that involved like three surgeries and uh now we're knocked on wood because
[1730.36 → 1735.40] so far so good now we're we're back to normal uh basically they didn't pay a dime and i was
[1735.40 → 1739.88] extremely proud of the taxes that I pay that made something like that happen the idea of small
[1739.88 → 1746.20] children having broken arms that don't get put in casts is horrifying to me yes so if that makes me a
[1746.20 → 1757.88] filthy commie then you can color me red baby colour me red um all right let's talk about uh oh
[1757.88 → 1762.68] you know what let's colour me green first got to make that got to make that sponsor money somehow

[1825.24 → 1831.56] for seat ah good old need for seat they're a dealer of taxonomic gaming chairs and every once in a while
[1831.56 → 1836.76] uh need for seats like oh yeah I don't know if advertising online as tech tips works that great
[1836.76 → 1841.64] and then they always come back because you know what the truth is its just a great relationship
[1841.64 → 1847.32] other than that they keep bailing on us uh it's a great relationship because it's a great product i I love
[1847.32 → 1854.84] the taxonomic chairs i I think they just use a way what not I think they use a way higher quality foam
[1854.84 → 1859.80] than the vast majority of other gaming chairs just because they look gaming doesn't mean they can't
[1859.80 → 1864.76] use high quality materials they've got a huge variety of sizes and selections they're comfortable
[1864.76 → 1869.40] they're I mean yeah reliable is a good word to describe it the taxonomic chair that's in my office
[1869.40 → 1873.72] actually no I lied a little bit because I have my water cooled one now but until Colin built me the
[1873.72 → 1878.44] water cooled one the taxonomic chair in my office looked exactly like the day I got it back when i
[1878.44 → 1883.72] did my first gaming chair review which happened to be a taxonomic other than some blue stains on the
[1883.72 → 1888.36] top from the back of my jeans um they're just freaking awesome they offer a custom embroidery
[1888.36 → 1893.96] service 30-day return policy two-year warranty, and you can use code LTT to get 50 bucks off for a limited
[1894.76 → 1901.24] don't imagine that every gaming chair is equal there are a lot of bad ones there are a lot that are
[1901.24 → 1907.16] actual garbage manufactured waste is or manufactured garbage is what I like to call it uh there's a lot
[1907.16 → 1913.40] of those uh taxonomic is not all right, and it's also brought to you by sea sonic speaking of things
[1913.40 → 1920.44] that are not manufactured garbage they got up to have 12-year warranties man sea sonic they're OG I mean
[1920.44 → 1924.20] you know how corsair made their oh sonic might get mad at me for mentioning this you know what I don't
[1924.20 → 1930.84] care you know how corsair made their name as a maker of quality power supplies they read they rebranded
[1930.84 → 1937.32] they rebranded to see sonic power supply okay that's literally exactly how it went down when
[1937.32 → 1943.48] they released the he 620 and 520 that was like you know what it's great I had one it was fantastic it
[1943.48 → 1948.52] was a great power supply because still works actually still works that was the one I just want to add this
[1948.52 → 1954.92] context that was the power supply that was ripped open and submerged in the mineral computer still works
[1954.92 → 1962.36] heck yeah um so see sonic they they make good um I don't know Walter are you
[1962.36 → 1967.32] watching is this a good is this a good sponsor read go buy a power supply
[1970.68 → 1977.56] they're quiet and quiet and okay all right why don't we uh why don't we move on and get on with the show
[1977.56 → 1987.32] here oh we got to talk about Nintendo Switch not pro yeah now people are made some people are
[1987.32 → 1992.20] mad some people are mad you know what I got a hot take I got a hot take so I want you to run us
[1992.20 → 1997.16] through the news Luke and then I'm going to hit you with a mad hot take we had there were lots of rumours
[1997.16 → 2001.88] of a new switch pro there are lots of rumours of different controller layouts different controllers in
[2001.88 → 2009.24] general uh i I remember even reading one that was literally just about the kickstand can I interrupt
[2009.24 → 2013.32] for one second oh wait actually no never mind I'm not going to mention it go ahead I'm sorry I'm so
[2013.32 → 2020.20] sorry I shouldn't have done that okay uh there 's's been uh better more advanced Terra processors
[2020.20 → 2026.12] there are higher resolutions there's been uh a dock that increases the performance of the switch
[2026.12 → 2033.32] there's been lots and lots and lots of rumours what we got is uh pretty much the same thing
[2033.32 → 2042.68] but with a better screen no controller changes no performance changes uh MSRP of 350. yeah, that's it
[2042.68 → 2048.28] coming in not really a switch pro but yeah available in October you get a better screen um there's more
[2050.44 → 2055.00] okay, okay I actually didn't know this part the new dock does have an Ethernet port for LAN
[2056.44 → 2062.44] all right um that sounds fine I guess I don't know I didn't find the wireless to be a problem
[2062.44 → 2067.40] but i I'm not going to say no hey when you're downloading big games it's if you want to play
[2067.40 → 2074.36] right now yeah like i bought an USB dongle for mine it's wired i just you know whatever
[2074.36 → 2080.28] yeah wireless basically right, so standard switch fits the new dock just fine which means the new
[2080.28 → 2084.52] dock is going to be a separate accessory as well almost certainly, and you could buy that if you
[2084.52 → 2092.20] wanted to for some reason um i I bought a custom doctor Mike's it was very cheap, but it's just
[2092.20 → 2097.40] small and has basically no um vertical height so it doesn't scratch the screen and stuff which is
[2097.40 → 2102.84] cool um other improvements include an adjustable stand enhanced audio more storage, and it comes
[2102.84 → 2109.24] in white um up from 32 gigs 64 gigs enhanced audio is very light on details so I have to wait and see how
[2109.24 → 2114.12] that pans out the same joy cons are being used I think this is the main complaint as far as I can
[2114.12 → 2119.24] tell most of the frustration comes from the same joy cons being used uh you can still get them fixed
[2119.24 → 2124.36] by Nintendo but I mean it's pretty frustrating having your joy con drift super rough and then needing to
[2124.36 → 2129.88] like ship off one of your controllers and not really be able to play without buying another really expensive
[2129.88 → 2135.56] controller um it's there's a note saying the switch pro might still be happening later I suspect it is
[2135.56 → 2141.56] um Nintendo is a huge fan of like many incremental little improvements especially when they have
[2141.56 → 2147.40] something that's working um and the switch is definitely working um and while people have been
[2147.40 → 2155.00] super excited about the switch pro I haven't heard a ton of people talking about like man I wish my switch
[2155.00 → 2161.08] was like twice as powerful bro um or necessarily even complaining about the resolution like the resolution
[2161.08 → 2166.68] is really low sure but I personally haven't heard a ton of complaints about the resolution
[2166.68 → 2174.28] on the switch um those just aren't the core complaints that I find the core audience of Nintendo
[2174.28 → 2181.88] users have um so it's interesting that being said personally still excited about a switch pro and I would
[2181.88 → 2189.08] love those things but yeah i think they are probably catering to the majority of their audience
[2189.08 → 2195.88] um by fixing the screen which is a very noticeable thing on the switch and not fixing pretty much
[2195.88 → 2201.40] anything else and thus keeping their profits very high uh which is something that Nintendo is an extreme
[2201.40 → 2208.60] fan of but yeah what's your take my hot take I love it I'm going to buy one on launch day really yep
[2210.20 → 2217.56] when i had my wisdom teeth pulled out um that was when I finally caved and bought a switch because
[2217.56 → 2224.20] I knew that I was going to be stuck in bed with nothing to do for like two days um I had it was the bottom
[2224.20 → 2230.68] ones out um it was like my dentist told me like look you're you're not doing anything dude
[2232.12 → 2238.52] this is going to be pretty rough I had to really get in there um, and so i I finally caved i finally
[2238.52 → 2244.20] bought a switch when I knew I was going to be stuck on my back for two days I pulled it out of the box and I went wow
[2244.20 → 2253.08] this screen looks like dog uh even back then it sucked uh never min doled it's a bad LCD there's a
[2253.08 → 2260.04] huge air gap uh which is sloppy cheap garbage even back then because you guys got to
[2260.04 → 2267.48] remember you could get replacement screens for like a nexus 7 tablets you know pretty nice IPS display
[2267.48 → 2273.96] that's like 10 years ago you could get them for like 20 bucks right like the fact that Nintendo on
[2273.96 → 2282.44] this 400 Canadian console had this garbage tier screen was always completely unacceptable to me and
[2283.48 → 2291.32] it's really the only problem that I've okay the uh actually no the on the plane on the plane
[2291.32 → 2296.20] the kickstand was a real problem for me as well those are the only two problems I have ever had with
[2296.20 → 2301.48] my switch I've had absolutely no joy-con drift although I am pretty careful with them and I'm
[2301.48 → 2307.56] not a super heavy player so that's something to note um a little bit more storage it's like yeah
[2307.56 → 2313.64] sure I mean the 50 price hike yeah that's the card for more for like more storage is not that
[2313.64 → 2317.88] different from what you'd get on like a phone or whatever so you could just consider this a 64 gig
[2317.88 → 2325.48] switch as far as I'm concerned and then getting a larger OLED display is like man I'm on that so fast
[2326.12 → 2331.32] so fast I've seen a lot of people upset with my take because I did post this on Twitter as a
[2331.32 → 2337.08] response to Anthony's tweet um I've seen a lot of people upset with me because I don't seem to care
[2337.08 → 2347.80] about the performance aspect of it you know what um i i I don't actually and here okay I would heavily
[2347.80 → 2354.44] argue that the majority of Nintendo's audience does not either and here's another here's another
[2354.44 → 2361.40] kind of hot take I consider the fact that Nintendo has stuck has maintained continuity here with
[2361.40 → 2368.28] the same Terra processor I actually think that's a good thing because what it means for people who are
[2368.28 → 2374.76] performance gaming enthusiasts who want to game at 60 fps or higher is that we're going to get even a
[2374.76 → 2382.84] larger catalogue of switch games to enjoy on switch emulators that will be able to upscale those games
[2382.84 → 2389.00] run at higher refresh rates so if you're an actual pc enthusiast you should give exactly zero oh my
[2389.00 → 2395.32] goodness about any of this and just go okay well great this means a deeper catalogue of switch games
[2395.32 → 2401.00] we don't have to completely redesign the emulators that have already been in progress for four years
[2401.00 → 2405.72] to accommodate all these new games that might have needed a ton of work if it was a
[2406.60 → 2411.32] Terra pro whatever I don't know I guess we'll, you know we'll find probably would have probably would
[2411.32 → 2416.28] have required a bunch more work what do you still play on switch uh most recently I played through
[2416.28 → 2421.56] bravely default 2 it's not a very good game but I was going to say I didn't think you even liked it i
[2421.56 → 2426.52] I didn't really i did end up grinding my way to the end though I finished it uh last week yeah
[2427.08 → 2431.40] or earlier this week I don't know yeah it's not a very it's not a good game but you are still
[2431.40 → 2436.76] actively using your switch is effectively what you're saying yeah yeah and I'll probably play breath of
[2436.76 → 2443.88] the wild too so that's you know you said you weren't I know but i I lied I'm going to buy i
[2443.88 → 2448.12] thought so I didn't play the DLC but I'm gonna I'm going to play the new game I'll play the new game
[2448.12 → 2458.84] I often don't play LCS um if LCS were still like frozen throne then I would but oh what a great these
[2458.84 → 2466.52] days when they're often like oh it's like a's like a one to three hour at a maximum if it's a large DLC
[2466.76 → 2471.08] adventure that you can go on um it's like okay I'm going to have to like to remember how to play this
[2471.08 → 2477.40] game that I haven't played in half a year just to do this like one mission and i the story probably
[2477.40 → 2482.20] felt concluded, and now it's just weird I don't know oh this is great uh Mario madness says Mario
[2482.20 → 2488.20] golf recently yeah apparently that's perfect I think I might pick it up so yeah there you go there
[2488.20 → 2494.20] you go i just uh you know I would uh Matt says breath of the wild had leg spikes absolutely it did
[2494.20 → 2500.12] doesn't run perfectly i just I don't know maybe I'm just over it maybe i I just got over it i just
[2500.12 → 2506.12] don't care any more so yeah and like I said multiple times I would like a higher performance switch I would
[2506.12 → 2512.52] like a baller switch pro I think that would be very cool I think I'm not the majority of the Nintendo
[2512.52 → 2518.60] audience um well they kind of did that once you got in perspective they basically made that product
[2518.60 → 2524.12] once it's called the Wii U it was a Wii on steroids that got new games
[2526.28 → 2533.16] yeah it didn't work no one cared nope I think there were other reasons why people didn't care
[2533.16 → 2536.92] oh yeah i know the marketing for it was terrible there were a lot of reasons that you was
[2536.92 → 2543.40] a failure, but my point is if I'm Nintendo uh that's that start of you know the same thing but like more
[2543.40 → 2549.64] powerful who cares they've always they have to understand that they're and I think yeah and i
[2549.64 → 2555.96] think the Nintendo audience like a lot of the games that they like are not super performance heavy uh and
[2555.96 → 2563.48] it, and it takes artistic styles that often look quite beautiful in ways um but aren't super
[2563.48 → 2568.52] performance heavy because they're not going for realism so they just need like a really nice screen
[2568.52 → 2575.72] and it's fine yep I'm so excited about the OLED screen I'm gonna, and you know what's great is
[2575.72 → 2582.04] because I have a gen like I have a launch uh switch I can probably get a pretty decent price for it
[2582.60 → 2589.08] because it's it should be hackable or whatever um gotcha uh so yeah I think I have an exploitable
[2589.08 → 2595.24] switch so I'm going to sell it I'm going to buy the new switch uh OLED and I'm going to just pay for all my
[2595.24 → 2605.00] games and everything will be good I'm excited cool all right yeah this is pretty oh, oh you know what
[2605.00 → 2609.96] man we should have transitioned into this topic from the right to repair executive order uh google's
[2609.96 → 2615.56] play store is under fire because i was explaining the difference between uh man I ended
[2615.56 → 2623.08] up in a really stupid argument on Twitter over this one as well uh people just don't seem to fundamentally
[2623.08 → 2628.92] um be for not people some of you like if you understand what it is don't take offence
[2628.92 → 2635.00] you guys, but you can't deny that there are a lot of people out there who don't fundamentally understand
[2635.80 → 2643.16] what anti-monopoly and antitrust laws are and why they exist and how they are there for your protection
[2643.16 → 2652.12] as a consumer um google's response to this uh antitrust lawsuit that's being brought about by 36
[2652.84 → 2659.08] states attorneys general is hilarious and it kind of says everything you need to know about the new
[2660.04 → 2666.28] uh non don't be evil era google in a blog post responding to the lawsuit google says
[2667.08 → 2671.96] it's strange that a group of state attorneys general chose to file a lawsuit attacking a system
[2671.96 → 2677.64] that provides more openness and choice than others this complaint mimics a similarly meritless lawsuit
[2677.64 → 2682.84] filed by the large app developer epic games which has benefited from android's openness by distributing
[2682.84 → 2692.36] its Fortnite app outside Google play okay so the fact that you're more open and provide more
[2692.36 → 2701.08] choice than apple is a low bar it's not a major accomplishment that is not that no one is applauding you
[2701.08 → 2708.52] that is not the stick that we that you need to be measured by so let's go through what's happening here
[2708.52 → 2716.20] um in a lawsuit filed in California court on Wednesday 36 states and Washington DC challenged
[2716.20 → 2722.44] google's play store policy forcing developers to pay 30 commission fee on sales made in their apps so
[2722.44 → 2729.72] this mirrors the epic v apple um and with less notoriety the epic v google lawsuits this is the
[2729.72 → 2734.28] fourth antitrust lawsuit launched against the company by U.S. government enforcers in the last
[2734.28 → 2740.28] year it's about freaking time the lawsuit alleges that google forced anti-competitive strategies on
[2740.28 → 2746.20] Samsung attempting to buy off the company to limit competition from the Samsung Galaxy app store
[2746.68 → 2752.60] uh so they like turning the galaxy store into a white label for the Google Play Store sharing the
[2752.60 → 2757.56] back end and billing while keeping a different face like okay that's not what Samsung wanted they
[2757.56 → 2762.68] wanted to maintain their independence from you uh which is exactly what antitrust laws are supposed to
[2762.68 → 2771.40] allow them to do um they also allege that android is now open source in name only uh this is on account
[2771.40 → 2778.12] of the fact that the Google certified version runs on over 99 of smartphones with licensed mobile OS's
[2778.12 → 2784.44] so if it's a Google certified version that is not all open source then you can't just say android's
[2784.44 → 2789.00] open source it's not that simple and tech enthusiasts have known that for a long time there's a big
[2789.00 → 2796.20] difference between AOSP and the android that you run on your smartphone um a new Google policy so
[2796.20 → 2800.92] sorry it also alleges a new Google policy will require developers of streaming services to pay
[2800.92 → 2804.84] google 30 on subscriptions purchased through the app if they want to make that available
[2804.84 → 2810.04] or that they be streaming only with no reference to where user can sign up now as you can imagine
[2810.04 → 2815.00] Luke and I have some personal experience with what that's like for an app developer
[2815.00 → 2821.88] um you know what google and apple should absolutely be allowed to provide a payment portal
[2822.68 → 2827.00] they should absolutely be allowed to help app developers with their payment processing
[2828.28 → 2836.92] but by making it 30 percent and by not allowing you to use anything else they are effectively the not
[2836.92 → 2844.04] allowing to you to use anything else and not allowing you to have that one cost more because if is we
[2844.04 → 2851.56] could just price adjust it like if paying through the Google Play Store yeah was just uh exactly the
[2851.56 → 2857.96] difference of cost to us for the payment processing um then sure of course why not if you would prefer
[2857.96 → 2863.80] to pay that way if it's easier for you the cost is low enough that you don't really care um great
[2863.80 → 2868.60] it doesn't matter to me but when it costs us more, and we're trying to like divvy out to creators and do
[2868.60 → 2873.40] all this other kind of stuff in a lot of situations it makes it like the apple one made it a literal
[2873.40 → 2881.40] zero cent transaction like we made nothing um and that just doesn't make any sense at all, and it's
[2881.40 → 2887.40] so frustrating and one of these things like they mention a streaming only app right like oh
[2887.40 → 2893.24] that doesn't sound too bad we can have a float plane viewer app you can't subscribe through it or whatever
[2893.24 → 2898.68] on the store like okay I can kind of understand that except that's not all that it is they don't let
[2898.68 → 2903.00] you contact support properly through the app because they don't and they and they don't allow
[2903.00 → 2906.84] you to have FAQs and all this other kind of stuff or at least that's how it was on the apple side of
[2906.84 → 2911.00] things apple's been changing things I might not be 100 on top of it right now, but they don't let you do
[2911.00 → 2917.16] those things because you could include references to a way to subscribe through those things like if you
[2917.16 → 2922.68] linked to a FAQ that was on your website or if you did anything like that if you linked them out of
[2922.68 → 2929.48] that app at all to any other resources that could potentially suggest subscribing differently
[2929.48 → 2936.60] yeah even if it doesn't that's against the rules so it ends up being extremely anti-user and anti-consumer
[2936.60 → 2944.04] to the point where as a app developer you don't even want to do it at all because it's just so
[2944.04 → 2950.12] frustrating for the user experience, and you end up getting tons of usually tweets complaining about it
[2950.12 → 2954.36] because they can't figure out how to officially contact your support because you're not allowed
[2954.36 → 2962.36] to link it properly and that's just bonkers I don't know, so someone on Twitter said well I mean
[2962.36 → 2968.68] is this really abusing consumers maybe if Netflix decided to dump the extra cost incurred by Google's
[2968.68 → 2975.88] processing fee on the consumer it would but I doubt they'll do that I read this tweet and my palm just
[2975.88 → 2982.84] about travelled all the way through my face grabbed my brain went out the back of my head and flushed my
[2982.84 → 2991.00] brain down the toilet what would what could possibly possess you to think that Netflix will not
[2991.00 → 3005.56] pass this cost along to the consumer yeah okay um you now and then someone else said so what so
[3005.56 → 3010.84] every store is antitrust there's nothing unfair about what apple or Google are doing you can
[3010.84 → 3015.40] subscribe to these services via the web then download the app and app and log in all they're stopping you
[3015.40 → 3021.64] from doing is advertising that fact via the play and app stores like every shop okay so the difference
[3022.20 → 3029.72] is that they are monopolies okay they're a duopoly fine whatever you want you wanna sort of split hairs
[3029.72 → 3035.48] like that we can the fact that they are a monopoly means that they are not allowed to behave this way if
[3035.48 → 3043.24] there was an actual competitive ecosystem for mobile devices or for app stores remember that's
[3043.24 → 3048.60] what epic games is arguing that there should be a competitive ecosystem for alternate app stores
[3048.60 → 3054.52] which would force apple and google to respond to complaints that their fees are too high and be
[3054.52 → 3058.92] competitive with other app stores blah blah blah that's that's like the whole thing the fact that they
[3058.92 → 3065.48] are a monopoly is what makes the behaviour bad if they weren't a monopoly then it would be fine so that's
[3065.48 → 3073.16] why epic is making that argument to be clear epic is not some kind of uh noble you know just doer of
[3073.16 → 3078.84] good deeds they absolutely are out to make money, but they're also not wrong the fact that they're out to
[3078.84 → 3088.12] make money does not make their point invalid um the lawsuit also alleges that google requires OEMS to
[3088.12 → 3093.48] pre-install a suite of Google proprietary apps and make it impossible to delete or remove many of them
[3094.04 → 3099.24] also that they provide preferential placement on devices home screens so in 2009 google required
[3099.24 → 3105.16] pre-installation of as many as a dozen apps by 2013 it was two dozen, and now it is up to 30 apps
[3105.16 → 3111.32] and you know what the reality of it is most google apps I wouldn't actually want to remove from my
[3111.32 → 3117.72] phone I mean I love Google Maps I love Gmail but what if I didn't yeah it is anti-consumer for me to
[3117.72 → 3123.64] not be able to remove crap I don't use from my device extremely you can make your product competitive
[3123.64 → 3132.04] I love Google Maps and I'm going to keep using it that's fine but how would you feel if McAfee antivirus
[3132.04 → 3142.52] um rip was pre-installed on your computer, and you couldn't remove it if McAfee antivirus removal
[3142.52 → 3149.40] tool does not exist anymore, and it is a permanent feature on your computer if mac is McAfee antivirus
[3149.40 → 3157.24] tool is great and I want to use it anyway then I'm perfectly happy if it's not because McAfee
[3158.20 → 3163.08] even if it was the best option around I would want the possibility to remove it for sure oh I'm sorry
[3163.08 → 3167.96] I was answering as like a general consumer so I'm looking at this from sort of like the bigger
[3167.96 → 3174.84] picture as long as it's great you don't really run into problems but what happens is when a monopoly
[3174.84 → 3181.72] uses its position as a monopoly to just have their product be the default regardless of how good or bad
[3181.72 → 3187.88] it is it tends to degrade in quality so eventually even though you might not feel like this is a
[3187.88 → 3192.84] problem today because you love Gmail, and you love Google Maps or whatever else eventually if google
[3192.84 → 3198.36] behaves this way and stifles competition on its platform it will be a problem
[3198.36 → 3212.12] uh so um yeah google's response is typical just uh honestly it's kind of evil they're just pretending
[3212.12 → 3215.72] they don't even see the problem they absolutely see the problem everything they did here was
[3215.72 → 3222.20] absolutely intentional, and they fully understand what they're doing and I hope that the United States
[3222.20 → 3231.80] government finally starts doing something about antitrust I mean it is hilarious to look at this
[3231.80 → 3242.44] stuff and compare it to how Microsoft was treated over Internet Explorer like what i if I'm is I'm Microsoft
[3242.44 → 3248.20] I would be outraged that google and apple get away with what they do what because they're like cooler
[3248.20 → 3254.92] or something i i I don't know I don't know I don't understand it everybody's just numb to it, I think
[3254.92 → 3258.68] i think i think the government, and we've talked about this a bunch I think the government got
[3258.68 → 3265.56] gun shy after Microsoft uh Mira TV says the US won't do anything because most of their money comes from
[3265.56 → 3272.04] those companies' no it doesn't you know that there's a whole other thing where they don't pay any tax
[3272.04 → 3279.48] and stuff right they like they don't now indirectly sure they employ a lot of people and create a lot
[3279.48 → 3287.32] of money moving around for the economy absolutely for sure, but it's not like they're going to stop
[3287.32 → 3292.76] doing that all of a sudden because the US government steps in and starts actually enforcing their antitrust
[3292.76 → 3300.04] and anti-monopoly laws uh Asama says I paid more taxes than Amazon, and they're a twitch viewer scrub so like
[3300.92 → 3306.52] it can't be a lot of money no offense I love our viewers on twitch it's just that I love
[3306.52 → 3315.96] the float plane and YouTube ones more especially okay all right all right, so this is funny
[3315.96 → 3320.92] they pay so float plane is clarifying well okay, but they do pay money to politicians and pay for their
[3320.92 → 3329.64] campaign ads ah yes that okay I thought you meant actually funding like the government uh metal gas
[3329.64 → 3335.00] yeah people in flow plane keep on saying that there's going to be a 20 super chat if I say
[3335.00 → 3341.32] it's Luke time uh so I just said it now you have to pay 20 super chats there we go cool very nice you
[3341.32 → 3347.24] know that I take the money right yeah no, no I know you know I've just I hope they know I hope they
[3347.24 → 3352.36] understand that okay yeah Luke gets paid the same regardless you get to see his pretty face no matter
[3352.36 → 3358.68] how many super chats you send him um or how about or however many you don't yeah you know Luke is Luke
[3358.68 → 3366.12] will still be employed nice by the way spend that 20 on Ltd store yeah we've got a deal right get
[3366.12 → 3372.52] something for yourself uh if you buy a classic 21 ounce orange Ltd bottle you get a keyboard shirt for
[3372.52 → 3378.60] free the discount gets applied when you add both to the cart so head on over there ltdstore.com ladies and
[3378.60 → 3385.00] gentlemen that's a genuinely wicked offer it is a wicked offer it's almost like there might be a
[3385.00 → 3393.32] next generation water bottle coming at some point and also like the keyboard shirt hasn't
[3393.32 → 3398.12] sold particularly well it's almost like we're doing that thing I said earlier where instead of
[3398.12 → 3402.84] discounting the product we're offering a bundle deal remember that thing I talked about it's almost
[3402.84 → 3407.96] like it's almost like I have a background in product management and merchandising I'm surprised
[3407.96 → 3413.64] the keyboard shirt isn't selling well I thought they were pretty uh it did okay it did okay but
[3413.64 → 3419.72] there are some colors that um that totally makes sense particularly yeah yeah we thought people were
[3419.72 → 3425.72] going to buy more along the lines of like rapping their colour of switch they like instead of just
[3425.72 → 3430.76] designing colours that look nice and everyone just bought designs that look nice so we completely
[3430.76 → 3441.24] overstocked on popular switches and that's okay so that's the thing in other news um
[3443.80 → 3449.24] yeah oh yeah this is kind of this is some dystopian level stuff I mean it never surprises me coming out
[3449.24 → 3457.56] of china but like basically they're using facial recognition on cameras on devices to control
[3457.56 → 3467.48] um kids gaming in China uh so maximum of 90 minutes of gaming on weekdays and a maximum of three hours of
[3467.48 → 3472.60] gaming on weekends and there are spending limits in games in my opinion that's like a good thing but it
[3472.60 → 3479.72] should just be everyone not just kids um or there should be I mean you know what I don't have the answer
[3479.72 → 3483.96] to that industry I don't actually know no, no you should be able to buy as much stuff as you want if you
[3483.96 → 3490.84] really want to freedom etc, but there's got to be a way to uh there should just be print better parental
[3490.84 → 3495.72] controls in my opinion well I don't know okay because like you look at something like the lotto industry
[3495.72 → 3501.40] right they have regulations gambling has regulations so it should be regulated I just don't have the
[3501.40 → 3508.92] right answers and I'm not an expert in that field uh, but basically you're oh right because sorry I don't
[3508.92 → 3514.04] buy these things so I sometimes forget they kind of exist I guess the spending money on games they're
[3514.04 → 3520.44] talking about loot boxes yes exactly yeah I would be completely fine personally and maybe some people
[3520.44 → 3525.72] hate me for this but yeah just call it gambling and don't allow miners to do it at all I don't care
[3525.72 → 3532.68] about spending limits just ban if it's gambling it is like i just Alex you want something generally
[3532.68 → 3537.88] most games that have them you're not allowed to buy something specifically some games yes but a lot of
[3537.88 → 3542.76] games that have them you have to buy the loot boxes and hope and that's gambling yeah anyway
[3543.48 → 3547.64] Alex put in here Linus as a parent would you want to have your kids gaming time limited like this well
[3548.20 → 3552.20] I don't understand why it needs to be facial recognition and the problem here is that the
[3552.20 → 3556.84] state is stepping in and that it's not a parent controlling it like I do have screen time limits on
[3556.84 → 3562.20] my kids devices absolutely uh but I don't need facial recognition because they're my children and i
[3562.20 → 3565.64] know where they are and what they're doing because they're my freaking kids and I'm able to make that
[3565.64 → 3574.28] decision if I decide you know what you know great job uh you know winning your badminton tournament
[3574.92 → 3582.12] um you got a ton of exercise this weekend because you played a tournament you can play video games for
[3582.68 → 3587.88] however long today you can relax on Sunday or whatever yeah exactly, exactly like
[3587.88 → 3596.84] that's my decision and the state stepping in and making it for me like yes I agree with limiting
[3596.84 → 3601.08] kids exposure to this stuff but I don't agree with my government coming in and telling me how to do it
[3601.96 → 3611.16] with that said it's clear that they have a problem in China with parents not enforcing screen time limits
[3611.16 → 3618.20] because gaming addiction appears to be a bit of an epidemic over there with that said is it more
[3618.20 → 3624.20] than it is here do we know that we do I don't know if we know that for sure, but we do know that uh
[3624.20 → 3631.80] culturally very very very long periods of time spent gaming has been more of a norm in Asia for longer
[3631.80 → 3639.32] than it has been here that we don't know um so what we know is that there is at least this perception that
[3639.32 → 3644.36] it is not being taken care of by the parents, and you could point at all kinds of reasons for that
[3644.36 → 3651.24] I mean part of the problem might be the uh, uh what is it uh what is it called the however
[3652.76 → 3663.64] nine six I want to say uh the nine six working hour system uh is blah blah work schedule
[3663.64 → 3670.12] so 9 00 a.m to 9 00 p.m six days a week is the 996 working hour system in China uh there's a lot
[3670.12 → 3677.32] of people there opposing it because it's like a very excessive work culture but I would imagine that
[3677.96 → 3683.56] in a culture like that if both parents are working you might actually end up out of necessity having
[3683.56 → 3689.00] your kids entertained by electronic devices a lot because you're not able to actually be there spending
[3689.00 → 3693.96] time with them playing non-electronic games with them like there 's's a thousand I'm not saying
[3693.96 → 3698.12] that's the only reason I'm just saying there's a thousand reasons that it could be a problem um
[3700.92 → 3707.96] so I don't I don't have the solutions but in my for my sensibilities the government stepping in and
[3707.96 → 3713.24] enforcing how often and how long my kids can use electronic devices sure as heck isn't it
[3713.24 → 3723.48] so yeah that's tough hey 996 sounds horrible um yeah it sucks yeah
[3726.28 → 3732.92] especially considering commutes yeah well you got to remember two different work culture like when we
[3732.92 → 3741.08] went and visited one plus's factory there were dorms like on site so that you can 996 your way to the top
[3741.08 → 3746.36] that would make a little bit more sense probably to be honest yep just because like certain commutes
[3746.36 → 3751.96] like i I mean where we're from it's not even that uncommon to have an hour-long commute if you add
[3751.96 → 3759.56] two hours on top of that that's 11 hours a day like phew that's not 11 hours of 14 hours a day
[3761.16 → 3769.24] big yikes yep so um got people saying very easy for people not living in a culture to criticize how
[3769.24 → 3775.32] another culture operates um yeah sure I mean I'm not I'm not criticizing it I'm just saying that
[3775.32 → 3779.32] could be one of the reasons that the government is stepping in to take care of this because people are
[3779.32 → 3788.68] literally not there to take care of it themselves um there you go uh what else we got here uh yes my new
[3788.68 → 3796.68] house challenges there have been some challenges so I actually shot a video there today kind of walking
[3796.68 → 3801.40] through some of this stuff so I'm gonna you guys are getting uh an early preview of some of this
[3801.40 → 3809.48] stuff but basically what I'm realizing is that as we go through and renovate some stuff um this is
[3809.48 → 3815.48] going to be my only opportunity with some of the drywall pulled off to run any cabling through the walls
[3815.48 → 3822.68] and through the floors that I want so while I'm not a big smart home kind of guy I've definitely done
[3822.68 → 3827.96] more research on it lately and I've found that there are some things that could probably make me
[3827.96 → 3833.96] more of a smart home guy like for example if I change out all my light switches now for I found a
[3833.96 → 3840.76] GE one that is both a light switch and a motion sensor and I tie all of it into home assistant along
[3840.76 → 3847.40] with a per zone HVAC system I could make it so that in the summer my air conditioning only turns on in
[3847.40 → 3854.36] rooms that are occupied that's pretty cool I could totally get into something like that like why am I
[3854.36 → 3859.64] if my kids are dumb dumb and leave their air conditioning on why am I air conditioning their
[3859.64 → 3866.28] bedroom for you know eight hours nine hours while they're at school, and they're you know lessons or
[3866.28 → 3872.84] whatever else that's that's ridiculous it's totally stupid, and so I'm kind of looking at it going oh boy
[3872.84 → 3879.16] um so maybe I do maybe I do want to do some of this stuff uh this is also my only opportunity to
[3879.16 → 3884.12] figure out okay where are my Wi-Fi access points going to do I want to do access control where security
[3884.12 → 3891.96] camera is going so one of the big challenges that I've run into is that the uh the heating is handled
[3891.96 → 3899.64] by a 10 zone water boiler system so it's called a hydronic system, so there's water running through the
[3899.64 → 3906.12] floors that's heated and then the heat um just radiates off the floors and heats the entire house
[3906.12 → 3913.40] that way it's super cool it's super efficient the problem is that there's 10 thermostats each of which
[3913.40 → 3921.56] only has two wires going to them which are a very basic literal actual mercury in a tube that literally
[3921.56 → 3926.92] actually rolls from one side of the tube to the other side of the tube to open or close a switch
[3926.92 → 3933.80] um to call for heating or cooling to that zone so if I wanted to install some kind of smart thermostat
[3933.80 → 3940.04] in there that would have the capability to also communicate with an ac system and maybe even you
[3940.04 → 3946.04] know smart controlled dampers so you could put different zones on your ac system I would have to
[3946.04 → 3952.12] run 10 thermostats worth of wiring through the walls or I'd have to find a thermostat that is a smart
[3952.12 → 3958.68] thermostat that can just take power off of those lines and do all of its communication via Zigbee or z
[3958.68 → 3966.28] wave back to a hub back to home assistant and then communicate with the uh the smart valves on the boiler
[3966.28 → 3973.64] system and then with the ac as well as with the smart uh dampers in the ducts for the ac system
[3973.64 → 3981.40] and all this stuff and I'm just dude I am so overwhelmed I am completely out of my depth
[3981.96 → 3986.52] people are asking if Brian the electrician is going to make an appearance again oh I'm sure Brian
[3986.52 → 3992.60] will end up here at some point or another, but we're actually having most of this done uh just with like
[3992.60 → 3997.64] a single point of contact contractor because there's a ton of stuff that we're that we're doing
[3997.64 → 4002.28] at the new place yeah you're doing lots of different things that make sense yeah, so there's gonna
[4002.28 → 4006.44] definitely be some Brian the electrician stuff because one of the things I've asked the general
[4006.44 → 4013.56] contractor to arrange is water cooling tubes that go from the mechanical room to outside the house
[4015.80 → 4024.04] can you think of what I might do with those no way whole home rack water cooling I'm totally
[4024.04 → 4031.24] going to do it I'm going to do it right this time though outside the house are you geothermal so
[4031.24 → 4037.64] if we were is we were changing the landscaping in the front yard I would totally bury a coil and i
[4037.64 → 4045.48] would totally do that but no uh I'm probably just going to do it kind of like we did at the Langley
[4046.12 → 4051.96] uh at the Langley office and uh yeah it's not mixed metals this time it's going to be awesome
[4052.52 → 4056.44] uh yeah well it wasn't mixed metal oh yeah it was mixed metals that was the problem yes no
[4057.08 → 4063.08] no stainless steel it should have been fine if that stupid thing from princess auto was actually
[4063.08 → 4071.32] stainless steel, but it wasn't um so I'm going to do that i I want to do an um like a heat recovery system
[4071.32 → 4076.36] on the uh on the server room as well because not everything will be water cooled like I'm not gonna
[4076.36 → 4082.92] water cool a network switch or whatever so I want to create like uh like a smart damper on like a duct from
[4082.92 → 4088.36] that room that can either kick the heat outside or like just chuck the heat into the basement
[4089.56 → 4098.20] in the winter um that's awesome I want to do like what else is there uh no uh what's some
[4098.20 → 4104.12] of you have you figured out how many computers you can fit in that area uh oh the land room
[4104.12 → 4110.04] downstairs yeah we're going to do five and then a smaller station for like a laptop so we could do up to six in
[4110.04 → 4115.80] there we've got to have like probably I guess probably next summer, but you've got to have like
[4115.80 → 4122.68] a barbecue pool day that ends in a land night I'm super down we'll do it I promise it'd be so cool
[4122.68 → 4128.52] that'd be so cool 100 oh man, and we could so we'd have oh that's awesome so we're going to have uh there
[4128.52 → 4136.84] will be pcs in the theatre room the rec room the um family room there will be two in the office mine
[4136.84 → 4143.48] and Ivan's desktops and then there will be five ones in the land room um is it a little overkill
[4144.04 → 4149.48] absolutely, but it also might not end up being quite that overkill awesome so one of the overkill things
[4149.48 → 4157.64] I'm doing is I'm running conduit to almost all of those places so instead of me having a computer in the
[4158.92 → 4165.40] in the office upstairs and a computer in the LAN room I could have one computer in the server rack
[4165.40 → 4170.44] and then I could just run fibre optic display port and fibre optic USB to both of those places
[4170.44 → 4176.44] clone the display and just sit down and use my computer at either of them completely interchangeably
[4177.08 → 4181.24] that would be pretty cool really, really cool another thing I could do is instead of putting the
[4181.24 → 4187.88] the five computers in the land centre there I could put a single virtualized computer really get
[4187.88 → 4193.40] hardware that actually does it perfectly like every time I've done a two gamers one CPU or whatever
[4193.40 → 4200.36] it's been a tech demo I've never actually made it perfect but if I could get exactly the hardware
[4200.36 → 4207.40] that exactly works perfectly I could do a for realties whole land centre one CPU gaming setup and now
[4207.40 → 4211.80] that they have 64 core CPUs I mean every one of those machines could have like 10 cores in it
[4211.80 → 4220.92] that's crazy 12 12. That's ridiculous and I'd have four left over for Plex transcoding or whatever
[4220.92 → 4227.48] so there's the more I poke around in this house and play around with the wiring the more excited i
[4227.48 → 4231.80] am to do kind of crazy stuff I talked to a solar roofing installation company today and I was like
[4232.84 → 4239.16] so um I couldn't help noticing that photovoltaic cells uh operate more efficiently when
[4239.16 → 4245.96] they're cool have you guys ever done an installation where you like run cold water up to the roof
[4245.96 → 4254.52] and then uh dissipate the excess heat into like a pool or something they're like no I'm like oh
[4255.32 → 4262.12] neat good to know so I guess we'd have to forge our own path there, but that wouldn't that be super cool
[4262.12 → 4267.96] that'd be awesome yeah all of this sounds fantastic yeah yeah very cool so I guess I'll need a pool
[4267.96 → 4276.92] then if I'm going to do that but of course that would be super fun oh that's great yeah so I'm I'm man I'm
[4276.92 → 4284.44] I'm excited I'm excited it's going to be freaking awesome uh I also found this super cool thing that
[4284.44 → 4289.80] uh runs on the hot side of your air conditioner so on the condenser side of your air conditioner
[4289.80 → 4296.52] it intercepts the refrigerant um runs it through a heat exchanger and then dumps the heat into your
[4296.52 → 4304.20] pool so you can basically heat your pool with your ac and not pay to heat your pool that's awesome I was
[4304.20 → 4311.24] like wow that's having a heated pool is sweet but paying for a heated pool is not sweet not
[4311.24 → 4317.40] cool yeah oh man so great which is why like a lot of people's just for I'm sure lion's knows but just for
[4317.40 → 4321.48] some context for people that don't know a lot of people's home pools are not heated because it's
[4321.48 → 4327.48] not cheap it's uh yeah heating that massive body of water when it's not already like really hot out
[4327.48 → 4334.20] and honestly even when it is pretty hot it can be difficult and expensive yeah absolutely uh Jamal
[4334.20 → 4343.96] Taylor says water cooled solar GTFO lol i i I think it would be pretty cool to do so so right but as we
[4343.96 → 4350.20] get into ideas like that I'm sitting here going okay well now I need a solar system that is that can
[4350.20 → 4355.64] be you know piped into home assistance so that I can actually monitor whether it's actually more
[4355.64 → 4362.68] efficient once we water cool it and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so I'm I don't know man it's
[4364.20 → 4369.96] it's exciting um the orca says offsetting the cost of a heated pool the cost of running ac is still a lot
[4369.96 → 4375.32] yeah but you'd be running it anyway that's the whole idea is that when the ac is running its
[4375.32 → 4381.64] heating the pool instead of heating the air around your house you're yeah you're harnessing previously
[4381.64 → 4388.28] wasted energy essentially it's still it's still energy it's still there you're just not wasting it
[4388.28 → 4392.92] yeah you're not necessarily going to be pumping your ac harder just so you can heat up your pool
[4392.92 → 4400.12] that sounds a little ridiculous but you're utilizing it instead um all right so yeah let me just see if
[4400.12 → 4405.48] there's any other sort of challenges that we've run into I mean honestly just making all these decisions
[4405.48 → 4411.08] now it's like terrifying because once we close the drywall back up that's it everywhere I ran conduit
[4411.72 → 4417.72] that's where there's conduit and there's stuff that i you know fundamentally sort of thousand foot view
[4417.72 → 4423.40] understand like you guys gotta realize I'm a generalist right like I will sometimes go and I'll
[4423.40 → 4429.80] I know enough to learn so I'll go and I'll learn a bunch about something and I will deploy it or I'll
[4429.80 → 4435.24] make my video about it and then I'll probably forget 70 of it because I'll move on to like the next thing
[4435.24 → 4442.28] that i have to learn about and i have to explain to you all um so I know enough about things like home theatre
[4442.28 → 4448.20] to know how to research it but when I'm trying to do all this stuff at once figuring out where all
[4448.20 → 4453.88] the conduit's going to run figuring out solar figuring out just general homeowner stuff like the
[4453.88 → 4458.68] new roofing figuring out the water boiler figuring out the ac learning home assistant blah blah blah
[4458.68 → 4464.12] when I'm doing all this stuff at the same time man my brain has just hurt this entire week even though
[4464.12 → 4469.96] I've been on vacation uh yeah it's its i have to i have to go research cell repeaters again because I did all
[4469.96 → 4473.96] the research for that back when we put one in the office, but presumably it's changed a little bit in
[4473.96 → 4479.08] the last six years so I got to go do that research again but yeah I've got like one bar on the main
[4479.08 → 4484.28] floor and basically no reception in the basement it's like no okay yeah we're gonna let's
[4484.28 → 4491.96] get a cell repeater um so I'm just I'm finding it pretty overwhelming to and to make all these to
[4491.96 → 4497.16] figure out all these things at once like home theatre another example fundamentally yeah i I understand the
[4497.16 → 4502.20] basics you want a projector you want it a certain distance away because you can only zoom so much
[4502.20 → 4505.72] unless you get one with interchangeable lenses, but then you're spending a bunch of money you want a
[4505.72 → 4509.96] screen do you want an ambient light rejecting one probably not it should be fine so then maybe we can
[4509.96 → 4514.28] get a dark one because we've got light control of the room and okay we're going to want we might as well
[4514.28 → 4523.80] wire up for Atmos even if we're not going to go you know eight dots two dots two or whatever uh you're going to want
[4523.80 → 4529.08] to figure out do you want a rack for all your av equipment do you want to not have a rack do I want
[4529.08 → 4533.80] to run a conduit over to the mechanical room and just have everything tucked away do we have a way
[4533.80 → 4538.68] to control turning things on and off from there okay now I've got to learn more about what is it called
[4538.68 → 4545.40] CEC um so now that harmony is not a thing otherwise I would have used it repeater so it's like I know a
[4545.40 → 4551.08] little bit about this stuff but getting down into the nitty-gritty details of like what part number do i
[4551.08 → 4555.72] order though and exactly where is it going to mount on the wall I'm just
[4559.72 → 4565.40] oh I wish I didn't have to do it all at once but the idea of doing it all at once is that you open
[4565.40 → 4570.36] up all the walls that way get it all done close up all the walls, and then you can move in and like
[4570.36 → 4577.08] actually live in your house that's that's kind of the idea uh vanilla donut says if you're going to
[4577.08 → 4581.48] make videos of the Reno why not let your employees help you in the research I absolutely could but
[4581.48 → 4586.36] part of the problem is that if I want all these systems to interact with each other like if I want
[4586.36 → 4595.00] my water cooled solar panels on my roof and my water cooled uh condenser unit on my ac and my pool
[4595.00 → 4601.00] filtration and pump and heating system to all interact with each other one person has to be in
[4601.00 → 4608.84] charge of figuring that out alert says just Netflix and chill with the laptop in bed like you know what
[4610.76 → 4615.96] probably not wrong probably not wrong says you need to shut your head down for a little and actually
[4615.96 → 4624.20] relax right but okay the problem is that if I relax and then I end up like wasting you know ten thousand
[4624.20 → 4629.08] dollars like this is a home renovation right the budget is not we're not talking like oh I got to choose
[4629.08 → 4636.12] between the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox One series x like if I could flip the one that I didn't end up
[4636.12 → 4641.72] liking on Craigslist and buy the other one it's not a huge loss they both plug into a HDMI cable
[4641.72 → 4651.80] like if I screw this up it could be a big problem uh I need to water cool my brain thanks our alias
[4651.80 → 4660.04] for the uh for the suggestion yeah I get right on that oh next summer that could be a fun project like
[4660.04 → 4668.04] a portable head cooler yeah just like a hat that you wear here's my master plan for the cooling
[4668.04 → 4676.60] system uh here we go I drew it up in MS Paint so you got your air conditioner Evan, so the cool air goes to
[4676.60 → 4682.52] a smart damper for airflow control, so those go to each room or zone, and then you've got your water
[4682.52 → 4688.20] boiler so hot water to the floor you've got smart temperature sensors and smart valves for flow control
[4688.20 → 4694.12] okay and then I've only got two wires so I put in a low voltage power source in the mechanical room
[4694.12 → 4698.20] and then I want a thermostat that communicates wirelessly with the smart valve the smart damper
[4698.20 → 4703.08] and Zigbee or Z-Wave hub that goes to a server running home assistant that this is my ideal world the
[4703.08 → 4710.28] problem is that while sort of conceptually that works finding the actual part numbers
[4711.32 → 4717.08] very difficult and while it's very easy to find uh an automation expert to come in and do everything
[4717.08 → 4723.00] for you every automation expert is trying to sell you their thing and if there's anything I've learned
[4723.00 → 4729.96] over the last little while working on this project it's that there are more home automation companies
[4729.96 → 4738.20] then there probably are home automation deployments okay there are so many companies i I find out about
[4738.20 → 4745.48] a dozen more I've never heard of every day that I'm working on this and I'm sitting here going I have
[4745.48 → 4755.72] never even set foot in a house or boat that is automated in any way who is actually how all
[4755.72 → 4761.96] these companies exist all with their own ecosystems that don't interact with each other yeah
[4764.52 → 4772.52] i i I don't understand it so I don't I don't want a closed system that I'm stuck with like there's a
[4772.52 → 4779.00] really cool one that I posted about um in uh in a YouTube community post I forget what it's called now
[4779.88 → 4785.48] uh your channel why is it so hard to get to my own community post there's no back-end tool for it, you just
[4785.48 → 4794.36] have to go to the public so stupid loxone looks super cool proprietary so if lox one for
[4794.36 → 4801.64] whatever reason doesn't exist anymore that's it I have a bunch of lox one crap that is now e-waste
[4802.20 → 4807.16] thanks for that and someone was uh someone was being very sort of critical of me saying well
[4807.16 → 4815.40] what are you what are you new to tech you expect it to be around for 10 or 20 years uh yes this is
[4815.40 → 4823.72] not a cell phone this is a house yes I expect it to exist for 10 or 20 years and if it doesn't exist
[4823.72 → 4829.40] I expect it to be an open ecosystem so I can just swap out the one that doesn't exist anymore for
[4829.40 → 4834.92] something that does exist and have it interact with the other stuff yes I do expect that that is not
[4834.92 → 4839.80] unreasonable and if we are gotten ourselves to the point where we think that that's unreasonable
[4840.36 → 4848.04] then we got to take a step back and evaluate people that is not reasonable open ecosystems are
[4848.04 → 4853.96] what we should be supporting for this stuff not things that only communicate with each other on their own
[4853.96 → 4867.48] close protocol so there you go um problems I don't have my place is small enough that I feel like any
[4867.48 → 4873.56] amount of automation would be pretty much wasted and useless and I'm completely fine with that well no
[4873.56 → 4878.68] there are things that could be very helpful like if you were out for the day, and it became very sunny your
[4878.68 → 4884.36] blinds could close be like hey we don't want it to be so hot in here thanks that would be useful
[4886.28 → 4891.24] so yeah that's fair okay I don't think I'm going to bother do that but yeah yeah
[4893.40 → 4901.08] uh i7-6969x says pro automaton here we're busy AF these homes definitely do exist all right fair enough
[4901.64 → 4906.92] also a note on c4 Creston closed systems they're great for our customers because they're super reliable
[4906.92 → 4911.32] and while expensive I don't have to worry about them disappearing also the customers that use them
[4911.32 → 4915.08] don't want to tinker they just want us to make their system work okay that's fair enough that's fair enough
[4915.72 → 4928.04] but what I want to do is uh I want to tinker with it right so there you go here's what it is Benji martin
[4928.04 → 4932.28] says I learned the hard way that having easily replaceable cables in the wall can prevent a lot of
[4932.28 → 4937.48] headaches it's like yeah in theory yes but then I'm running a whole bunch of conduits now when I don't
[4937.48 → 4943.96] necessarily need that I have wiring in the walls now I just want to use smart devices to find a way to
[4943.96 → 4952.92] use them um civilen says you should look at ceramic window tint for that heat problem uh okay so there
[4952.92 → 4959.64] you go there's a tip for you Luke anyway uh we've got some super chats to get through here so why don't
[4959.64 → 4963.96] we do that unless we've got anything else that's a huge topic now it doesn't really look like it
[4963.96 → 4969.24] oh, oh my goodness a lot of people sent super chats today guys we don't really like to do super chats um
[4970.44 → 4978.76] LTG store yeah those are good ways to support um okay
[4980.92 → 4985.32] uh lewis says uh when are the mouse pads coming back you guys mentioned them and I got exciting for
[4985.32 → 4990.84] not I got excited for nothing they're coming back as soon as they arrive right now global shipping is
[4990.84 → 4995.88] a cluster so they should have been here already, but they're not so I don't want to promise anything
[4997.56 → 5002.84] uh oh MAL says with the coal shortage thing that's uh because of china's trade war with Australia and
[5002.84 → 5006.92] them deliberately not importing Australian coal even though there are thousands of tons of it docked in
[5006.92 → 5012.76] Chinese ports right I have heard about that china's real mad about Australia the Aussies
[5012.76 → 5022.60] uh kit says is this going to affect gaming laptop prices I wouldn't affect expect it to affect it as
[5022.60 → 5029.72] much no uh Joe's way sup guys really interested in OG water cooling like aquarium pumps sketchy
[5029.72 → 5036.68] radiators tons of cold cathode lights is it possible to make a blast from the past master of the land
[5036.68 → 5042.12] party bill or master the land party build blog um that's not a terrible idea we're actually planning a
[5042.12 → 5047.40] video uh using a heater core for water cooling that's what that weird car radiator strapped to
[5047.40 → 5051.80] the top of the case video was supposed to be, but there was a miscommunication, and we ended up with
[5051.80 → 5057.96] a radiator instead of a heater core and a video quota to hit so uh that's my admission that
[5057.96 → 5063.96] that video was not one that I would have greenlet making at all and I am well aware that it is not our
[5063.96 → 5075.40] the finest work um Leighton says my Linus sequin pillow got porch pirated which is a bummer, but there's
[5075.40 → 5079.56] something satisfying about the thought of them getting all excited to see what they snagged only
[5079.56 → 5087.40] for it to be Linus's face on a pillow that's pretty great that is really great um
[5087.40 → 5094.52] um okay Austin says my fear is that the FTC will stop at agriculture and the anti-right to repair
[5094.52 → 5098.20] crowd will use that as evidence that right to repair already exists and doesn't need to expand to tech
[5098.20 → 5104.12] yeah I think that's a big concern for everyone Nathan says I bought a house two months ago and living in
[5104.12 → 5109.80] it without water and I have finally got water in it today I have such a higher appreciation for water now
[5109.80 → 5116.68] um thanks Nathan that is a that is a cool story bro moment if I've ever heard one wow uh mark Zimmerman says
[5116.68 → 5121.80] hey Linus fan since 2018 how likely do you think it is that trillion dollar system houses like
[5121.80 → 5126.52] uh Samsung will just crowd out general purpose hardware manufacturers with heavily proprietary
[5126.52 → 5131.48] commodity devices for consumers I mean they already tried the good news is that there's still enough
[5131.48 → 5144.04] competition between them, so there's that um all right uh I think he means just I think that last
[5144.04 → 5152.04] super chat is talking about silicon shortage oh wait no I don't think so no I don't think so no okay
[5152.04 → 5158.20] okay uh QWERTY 22 says i7 6969x here a deal's a deal Luke the real MVP sent twenty dollars all right
[5159.32 → 5167.56] thanks Matt Welch um victor says I have an old system that's showing a CPU bottleneck with a modern GPU
[5167.56 → 5171.96] should I upgrade now or wait for next gen and ddr5 I don't think we're that close to ddr5 I think it's
[5171.96 → 5176.36] coming like next year, and we're still like six months away yeah um so yeah I mean it's always
[5176.36 → 5183.80] the question right should I upgrade now or should I wait you know what um i I would just as long as
[5183.80 → 5190.04] you're not paying scalper prices just go rising 5000 man it's its great it's great it's good
[5190.04 → 5197.88] stuff um josh says hey I'm just wondering if your stance on sponsored showcases has changed since we got
[5197.88 → 5202.28] a showcase on a Tuesday in place of a normal video I trust your ethics just wondering what happened
[5202.28 → 5209.08] what happened was origin actually just did not weigh in at all on the content of that video other
[5209.08 → 5215.96] than that we had to talk about the specs which we obviously would in any video anyway um they just
[5215.96 → 5219.64] let us completely do our thing and i actually really enjoyed making the video I thought it was
[5219.64 → 5224.44] a good video I thought it had a lot of actually good information uh it was a very honest video
[5224.44 → 5228.28] everything I said was exactly what I thought because I was just sitting there going oh they're
[5228.28 → 5232.44] sponsoring this video, and they have absolutely no guidelines for it whatsoever okay YOLO here we go
[5232.44 → 5237.24] I'm going to make fun of giant laptops I mean they literally sponsored a video where I was like people
[5237.24 → 5243.00] buy these things um so from my point of view yes it was a showcase in the sense that it was a fully
[5243.00 → 5252.92] sponsored video, but it also was just exactly what I would have said about that laptop um anyway so I uploaded it
[5252.92 → 5259.72] on a Tuesday instead of as a Friday extra release so that's that's my that's my take uh thanks com
[5259.72 → 5269.48] graduates uh hazardous says tell Luke his stash is great Luke your stash is great I get positive feedback
[5269.48 → 5276.36] about it significantly more than negative feedback but I don't like it that looks great it's the whiskers
[5276.36 → 5287.00] are just they're so long yeah they're great that's what I said all right um what else we got here Angelo
[5287.00 → 5292.04] says play star citizen with my Oregon eye please mostly ask Luke Linus is too much of a troll
[5294.20 → 5302.76] nah sorry bro first I have my own org bolt it's a thing um second of all it's probably going to be
[5302.76 → 5309.64] another like six months before I took that game oh man and then after that it'll probably be another
[5309.64 → 5314.04] six months and then after that it'll probably be another six months that's probably I'll keep going
[5314.04 → 5322.68] for quite a while um let's see Julian fully not expecting star citizen to be in a state where I'm
[5322.68 → 5327.40] happy playing it consistently for probably like three four more years I wouldn't be surprised I won't be
[5327.40 → 5332.60] surprised uh Julian says bought a 40 ounce water bottle I thought I wouldn't get it at all it had
[5332.60 → 5338.36] been lost for so long I got a refund but I got a message from the postal office that it arrived here's the money back
[5338.36 → 5353.32] hey thanks appreciate that um uh krill says Kira host Ohio Hiroshima Kira Hiroshima
[5353.32 → 5357.16] says did you watch the lewis Grossman video getting funds to put right to repair on the ballot he also
[5357.16 → 5361.64] found out Steve Wozniak agrees on with right to repair need sponsors and wants to get the word
[5361.64 → 5368.68] spread uh I think unless it's a new one I think I did and I think I responded to it in a video um
[5369.40 → 5375.16] garfish says I actually did water cool a solar panel as a test I glued solar pool heating strips
[5375.16 → 5382.84] beneath the panel uh temp coefficient for PV is like minus 0.25 per one see above 25 degrees if you can
[5382.84 → 5389.88] also heat your pool by cooling your solar panels I am not familiar enough with those terms temp
[5389.88 → 5394.12] coefficient panel temp coefficient I don't know exactly what a panel temp coefficient is but I'll
[5394.12 → 5402.84] have to I can infer a fair bit of it so it's like your efficiency gets 25 percent worse per one degree
[5402.84 → 5407.00] above 25 degrees Celsius okay I think I fully understood it now it just took me a sec it's look
[5407.00 → 5411.48] it's Friday okay um so yeah it sounds like if we could cool them down that would be good
[5412.84 → 5420.04] uh okay blah blah first time I was here live in a while I'm super excited about the mini see review
[5420.04 → 5423.88] you guys did I love my petrol mini I'm glad it sounds like I won't have to switch away from them
[5423.88 → 5428.68] when they go all EV at the end of the decade yeah the mini uh the mini the electric mini is pretty
[5428.68 → 5436.68] pretty cool fun um all right what else we got here man there's so many today okay guys i I don't
[5436.68 → 5443.32] know I don't think I can do anymore but hey thanks great for thanks for watching the show
[5443.32 → 5446.68] apparently oh apparently the Grossman things new I must have missed it I've been completely checked
[5446.68 → 5450.76] out this week ladies and gentlemen uh it's new as of the last couple of days, so apparently there's been
[5450.76 → 5456.84] some big updates yeah um definitely fully support his cause both literally and through influence we've
[5456.84 → 5461.96] sent him money we've made videos uh we're talking about it now guys it's an it's an important cause and
[5461.96 → 5470.04] it affects all of us all of us uh David Crosby sent a super chat I'm paying just to let you know
[5470.04 → 5475.40] that on bing float plane is not even on the first page I can send you a picture it doesn't surprise me
[5475.40 → 5478.92] I mean it's bing what do you want awesome yeah
[5481.96 → 5487.96] so I think that's pretty much it thanks you so much I do appreciate that you did like an
[5487.96 → 5494.52] and uh what is it called not archaeological anthropological dig to uh to find out that
[5495.16 → 5501.00] in that weird realm of unknown space that is bing there is a search issue I do appreciate that
[5501.00 → 5508.44] yeah that was that's the lord's work truly but seriously yeah it doesn't surprise me but i
[5509.00 → 5513.64] I mean I guess it's a concern I don't even know what we would do about it nice the well you can do some
[5513.64 → 5520.12] stuff the uh the forums the LCT forum a topic talking about float plane is the first thing that
[5520.12 → 5528.28] comes up good job for yeah the forum SEO is a lot better uh theory says well here's the problem
[5528.28 → 5533.00] Linus sent the money to lewis Grossman instead of to bing yep I should have sent all the only
[5533.00 → 5537.88] fans money to bing that would have sorted it out true all right thanks for tuning in guys we will
[5537.88 → 5554.36] see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[5554.36 → 5563.48] so
[5565.48 → 5569.88] SJ hockey you can just buy a pre-water cooled GPU that has a block on it already
[5569.88 → 5579.48] then that might solve your problem
