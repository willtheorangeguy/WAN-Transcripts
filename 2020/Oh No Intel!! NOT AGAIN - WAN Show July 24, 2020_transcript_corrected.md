[0.00 → 11.90] what is up my ladies and gentlemen welcome to the one and only when show we've got a fantastic show
[11.90 → 17.10] for you guys today we've actually got a lot to cram into the show intel just announced
[17.10 → 24.48] seven nanometre delays I mean they're barely shipping 10 nanometers and and and now they're
[24.48 → 33.40] talking about delays on seven holy smokes they lost 16 of their stock value holy shrikes uh yeah
[33.40 → 41.48] in other news AT&T has apparently been scaring customers into buying new phones it's an it's a good
[41.48 → 48.12] tactic yeah what does that even what does that even mean it's an it's a very high level uh movement
[48.12 → 53.14] high level business decisions freak out your customers good move uh NVIDIA considers acquiring
[53.14 → 60.30] arm which could be a very interesting uh like chess piece against some other companies and uh
[60.30 → 66.48] over a thousand databases have been nuked just deleted entirely with the only calling card
[66.48 → 75.06] remaining afterwards just being meow ouch kitty got claws all right let's roll that intro this
[75.06 → 79.66] should be a good one I mean meanwhile apple is sued for refusing to help iTunes gift card scam victims
[79.66 → 83.32] there is so much to work through here today so let's not waste any more time
[83.32 → 91.82] apparently I'm really quiet uh
[91.82 → 100.16] I call lies I call lies on that okay go ahead hit me testing one two three four yeah you're a touch
[100.16 → 108.56] quiet uh let me see how I can fix that maybe I could do this all right hit me again Luke
[108.56 → 113.78] testing one oh wow yeah you're very loud now they're very loud now nobody will complain about
[113.78 → 120.52] your quietness at this point in time all right so the original poster on the forum of the intel
[120.52 → 128.50] seven nanometres delay story is illegal water and also vegetable stew uh this is real rough during their
[128.50 → 135.56] q2 2020 earnings call this week intel announced that it has now delayed the rollout of seven nanometre
[135.56 → 142.68] CPUs by six months relative to their previously planned release date uh yields for their seven
[142.68 → 148.92] nanometre process are now 12 months behind the company's internal targets um so I guess that means
[148.92 → 154.60] they must have had like a six-month buffer compared for their public release versus their internal
[154.60 → 160.68] targets, and they have chewed through all of it and then some and if you guys recall part of intel's
[160.68 → 166.72] story around the 10 nanometre delays was hey guys here's the plan we're going to fast track seven
[166.72 → 173.88] nanometre so that uh you know yeah this 10 nanometre delay won't happen so much we're just gonna kind of
[173.88 → 183.08] we're just gonna kind of move past it um not so much now both 10 and 7 nanometre have been
[183.08 → 189.62] delayed substantially so they're saying now that their seven nanometre CPUs will not debut on the market
[189.62 → 200.74] until late 2022 or early 2023 oh here's the craziest part Luke did you ever think you would live to see
[200.74 → 208.34] the day that intel would consider using a third party foundry no third party foundry I knew exactly
[208.34 → 213.46] where you're going with that and no not at all me neither that is the most surprising part of this whole
[213.46 → 223.30] conversation as the hold on what I think it was jerry sanders the third uh where's that quote
[223.30 → 232.58] real men have fabs was what jerry sanders uh AMD founder jerry sanders lobbed against rivals
[232.58 → 240.98] um now obviously um it's a little dated yeah obviously AMD doesn't use their own foundries anymore
[240.98 → 247.46] uh so and jerry sanders to be clear was the founder of AMD not intel uh jerry sanders the third
[247.46 → 255.94] um but I think intel has definitely still taken that approach and yet here we are the contingency plan
[255.94 → 266.90] is to use third party foundries oh so yeah i i I still feel like long term they'll move back away from it
[266.90 → 275.30] i I feel like it's a are we have been falling, and we are gaining speed in a downward direction
[275.30 → 282.18] and we need something to try to swoop us back up and I fit and I think once they stop just
[283.62 → 287.54] like I just said gaining speed in a downward direction like they have been for years at this
[287.54 → 296.58] point can I just say I love that gaining speed in a downward direction um i I think they'll move back to
[296.58 → 302.42] just their own fabs eventually, but it might be quite a while so well as long as they don't have
[302.42 → 307.86] process leadership what else are they supposed to do they have to stay competitive so allegedly
[307.86 → 312.90] they're going to be using third-party foundries for the chaplets or tiles in their forthcoming
[312.90 → 318.66] seven nanometre GPUs called Ponte Vecchio I don't know what language that is so hopefully I didn't
[318.66 → 324.74] butcher the accent too bad and then their first seven nanometre server CPUs granite rapids are now
[324.74 → 331.70] supposed to arrive in 2023 that's a year late meanwhile AMD's roadmap outlines five nanometre
[331.70 → 339.14] Genoa processors coming before the end of 2022 I do want to interrupt this broadcast to bring you a bit
[339.14 → 347.30] of a reality flash just because one manufacturer says this is our seven nanometre process and another
[347.30 → 353.70] says this is our five nanometre process does not necessarily mean that that five nanometre process
[353.70 → 360.10] actually has greater transistor density than the seven nanometre one so if you look I mean really
[360.10 → 367.22] I would love to see us transition just to transistor density as opposed to some arbitrary measurement we
[367.22 → 372.98] did a really great tech quickie uh probably about a couple of months ago now that went through the different
[372.98 → 379.62] methods that chip manufacturers have used to measure how many nanometres a processor is like it used to be it was just the
[379.62 → 387.54] gate length but then what happened was it was able to shrink more than other essential features of the transistor
[387.54 → 394.42] and so even though you had these much smaller gates the actual transistor density on the silicon was not higher
[394.42 → 406.58] so they switched to well okay now let's measure it this way so it's its not like this sort of fixed way of of measuring the density of a chip i I really wish that
[406.58 → 411.14] uh I think that everyone would use something kind of similar but um to be clear
[413.78 → 419.86] intel ain't leading the pack anymore however you'll want to measure it um if this comes to fruition
[419.86 → 428.02] and it looks like investors have reacted to that news I mean this is from uh July 24th 1 32 pm, so this is from
[428.02 → 434.58] four hours ago, and they had already dropped 16 today I'm just going to have a look at intel stock
[434.58 → 443.38] as far as I know it's now negative 16 okay so oh it looks like um it's uh oh has it closed for the day
[443.38 → 447.86] I can never remember like when it closes yeah it's that it's an after hours trading apparently it's up a
[447.86 → 455.30] touch but uh it still ain't uh ain't a good look for intel right now because the thing too is intel's
[455.30 → 460.34] trying to transition to be you know we want to be more than just a CPU company right like they want to be a
[460.34 → 466.98] semiconductor company well fun fact if you want to be a semiconductor company not just a CPU company
[466.98 → 475.78] you still need cutting edge you know manufacturing capabilities so that's that's real that's real
[475.78 → 480.42] awkward right there right now yeah and not that it's like super important with the current
[480.42 → 488.18] conversation Ponte Vecchio which I am 100 certain I just butchered is a bridge in Italy thank you for that
[488.18 → 495.54] yeah now everyone knows at least those people who are clever enough to watch the wan show every
[495.54 → 502.10] week they know oh big brain uh all right so intel's first seven nanometre processors are now scheduled
[502.10 → 510.26] to debut for either laptops or desktops in 2021 q2 man they're gonna oh man this is going to be rough like
[510.26 → 518.66] if is is you're one of the people who's still cheering for intel um man when zen 3 hits
[518.66 → 525.54] later this year AMD meanwhile has confirmed yet again uh those rumours that we're delaying zen 3 not
[525.54 → 532.10] true we are launching zen 3 this year um zen 3 is rumoured to have a significant performance uplift
[532.10 → 538.90] compared to zen 2 I don't know what they're going to do they might start to do some crazy stuff you know
[538.90 → 548.18] yeah like to be clear even zen 3 it's not like intel isn't still going to have a competitive performing
[548.18 → 554.98] product where they're going to run into trouble is their costs because AMD's chaplet design is so
[554.98 → 562.02] economical not to mention that if AMD gets a node out ahead of them it's not just going to be more
[562.02 → 568.10] economical because chaplets it could be more economical just because the die sizes can be so much smaller
[568.10 → 576.18] like its boy is it is that ever going to be a rough freaking ride like I don't even know what
[576.18 → 583.70] would you do okay Luke I know too much so I can't speculate, but you can what would you do if you're
[583.70 → 590.18] intel, and you're like your cost is higher than your competitor, and you are slightly behind you know
[590.18 → 594.82] that's what I'm expecting when zen 3 launches I'm expecting them to be slightly behind in raw performance
[594.82 → 598.66] with significantly worse power consumption and therefore heat output what do you do
[601.54 → 601.78] uh
[604.82 → 613.06] I don't know they're in such a rough spot uh I think personally that I would almost sit on my laurels
[615.38 → 620.18] pick a few chips try to find a way to make them as cheaply as possible
[620.18 → 628.58] make them cheaper on the market and look for wins with those chips like okay this chip is
[630.10 → 637.86] going to be like the best for 95 percent of or 99 if we're being honest like gamers like all gamers
[638.66 → 646.74] this chip is going to be the best for like 99 of office users they're not they're not the most fancy
[646.74 → 655.38] maybe it's a four core most games still don't really care beyond that but go value yeah
[655.94 → 661.06] the thing the problem is that AMD and like zen 4 is gonna show up, and you're still going to have nothing
[663.06 → 668.98] like AMD is going to be able to react to that like what if AMD just drops their price they've got the
[668.98 → 675.94] margin they've got the margin to work with yeah they totally could but I think
[677.30 → 678.26] at the same time
[681.14 → 685.46] you'd hopefully be like winning hearts and minds which is something intel has not done
[686.26 → 695.70] for a long time and them acting first and making AMD drop their price might do that instead of them
[695.70 → 702.10] being the ones that are like yup our extreme edition costs 500 bucks more now get wrecked
[702.10 → 707.94] here's my problem get wrecked you know what no, no no I don't think they I don't think they have the
[707.94 → 715.30] balls there you heard it here first I don't think they have the stones, and you know why I think they're
[715.30 → 721.94] well okay I don't know maybe the attitude changes today maybe the milk is treated as spilt
[721.94 → 730.02] at this point since the stock price took the hit already anyway but now the disconnected
[730.02 → 736.50] executives as far as I can tell um maybe they got a reality check here maybe they just felt it in
[736.50 → 740.82] their wallets and might actually pay more yeah maybe they might do something but here's my problem
[740.82 → 748.02] because intel knew they already knew when they launched z490 there's no way that executives hadn't
[748.02 → 753.46] already been briefed on that seven nanometre had problems like if we're finding out in an earnings call
[755.14 → 760.50] the people at intel aren't hearing this for the first time unless they're completely different business unit
[760.50 → 768.50] like the chip guys knew so why would it be then if they knew that they had nothing to fight AMD with
[768.50 → 775.22] for the next 18 months at least like hold on a second seven nanometre CPUs blah blah hold on a second
[775.22 → 782.10] um wait a minute seven will not debut okay it looks like we've got a couple different dates in
[782.10 → 787.94] in our notes here one of them says first seven nanometre processors 2021 q2 and another one says
[787.94 → 794.90] late 2022 or early 2023 that sounds more like it so anyway they knew they have they knew they have
[794.90 → 802.02] nothing for two years right so why do they go and pull consumer unfriendly moves like limiting the
[802.02 → 809.22] maximum memory speed on the value chipsets if the plan was to say okay we need to be we need to win
[809.22 → 816.26] over consumers by being consumer friendly because the thing is intel still has oh yeah that does not
[816.26 → 824.74] seem like the plan but currently at all I know you asked what I would do though not what I think intel would
[824.74 → 833.86] do can I can, we make that a bracelet what would intel do what would intel do, and it's just like the evil
[833.86 → 842.98] version it's not even evil it's just like it's like i you know dumb it's the low IQ version
[846.66 → 852.66] there's been so many moves for so long I really wish there was a follow-up I've actually mentioned this
[852.66 → 857.86] on wan show a couple of times i had a conversation with someone at intel, and they asked
[857.86 → 865.54] me like how I thought they were doing in a bunch of different realms uh they were talking about uh
[865.54 → 870.74] like processors for cloud compute which is a very different conversation than processors for gaming
[870.74 → 874.74] but I have some insight into that due to float plane and all this other kind of stuff, and it's a really
[874.74 → 878.98] good conversation, and they're like yeah we should follow up on this and like I'd like to hear more like
[878.98 → 883.86] honest answers to these questions and I think more people in the company need them and I was like
[883.86 → 890.74] yeah and then there was just dead air, but that's their problem is they have so many people there that
[890.74 → 898.10] care so much and yeah and like that person clearly did care yeah but probably internally was shut down
[898.10 → 902.34] in some way, so there was like no I don't even blame them for not really following up there was probably
[902.34 → 910.02] no point i got the funniest dm from one dr Curtis you know dr Curtis right of course the one
[910.02 → 917.78] and only dr Curtis um he goes so he was clearly watching my recent rant video because he goes
[919.46 → 928.18] quote stop listening to bean counters end quote new line promote CFO to CEO laughing emoji and I'm like
[928.18 → 936.66] I'm like yeah I know there's a perfect quote let me see if I can find it really quick uh
[943.78 → 950.82] it just made me laugh so hard like it's not IAN doesn't message me that much because he and i
[950.82 → 957.54] were in different time zones and like I don't know we're we're not very rarely working on like
[957.54 → 962.10] the same project at the same time that would give us cause for collaboration or whatever there's no
[962.10 → 968.42] trade shows this year so we can't go get ramen in the middle of the night or whatever um so we don't
[968.42 → 974.66] that that's the part I miss the most for sure so we don't we don't talk that much but like out of out
[974.66 → 980.74] of every time we've talked that is the hardest I have ever laughed when I got that dm just out of
[980.74 → 984.42] nowhere in the middle of the afternoon and I'm like yeah pretty much
[984.42 → 990.50] I just thought of a pretty interesting idea yeah you should host like a round table
[992.34 → 995.70] a life like a live stream that's just like a round table of tech mine
[996.90 → 1004.42] of tech what tech minds but like a like Zoom meeting round table of tech minds I mean that's
[1004.42 → 1008.90] kind of what the wan show was supposed to be with like guests and stuff we could kind of try and do that
[1008.90 → 1013.22] again do you want to bring guests on the show again I'd be interested yeah like we're not having
[1013.22 → 1019.86] these like internal among tech people conversations because we're not going to these shows and having
[1019.86 → 1024.26] those ramen meetings yeah which is a good way to describe it so i think that could be pretty
[1024.26 → 1032.34] cool oh people are asking which IAN um IAN is dr IAN Curtis uh from anon tech and also i really
[1032.34 → 1038.50] think he needs to rename this I don't think it's great branding but um you know he's more he's more
[1038.50 → 1045.38] of like a tech mind and less of like a branding mind I suppose uh his YouTube channel is tech
[1045.38 → 1053.06] potato uh he recently levelled up his thumbnail game, and he went from doing like 800 views a video to
[1053.06 → 1061.86] like 8 000 views a video nice yeah yeah see he's they all give in the end do you see uh
[1062.74 → 1068.98] do you see what was it snazzy doing like sponsored vacuum videos now so great yeah welcome to the
[1068.98 → 1077.38] welcome to the squad everybody falls um I was just the first anyway so I want to get through this just
[1077.38 → 1082.90] before we get too far away from it yeah you mentioned the promote CFO to CEO position
[1082.90 → 1088.58] laugh so whether you like it or not there's a quote from Elon Musk that I've always really liked
[1089.46 → 1095.06] the path to the CEO's office should not be through the CFO's office, and it should not be through the
[1095.06 → 1103.14] marketing department it needs to be through engineering and design 100 especially in that
[1103.14 → 1108.18] type of company I'm sure there are some companies where like no it's literally just a marketing
[1108.18 → 1113.22] company yeah it should not necessarily be that way if you're a creative agency you should have a
[1113.22 → 1119.22] marketer but I think that's what he means though is whoever is sitting in the CEO's office should have
[1119.22 → 1128.26] the expertise that it or should have expertise in that company's core business, and you know tesla i
[1128.26 → 1132.82] don't care what kind of engineer you put in the CEO's office software engineer hardware engineer
[1132.82 → 1137.06] you could make the argument either way for what kind of company they are a software or hardware
[1137.06 → 1142.90] company they're both so I don't care what kind of engineer it is, but it should absolutely I mean
[1142.90 → 1151.06] they literally as a policy don't market I mean they market but not in a conventional sense
[1151.70 → 1159.54] yeah in very different ways yes so putting its putting some MBA you know frigging you know MBA
[1159.54 → 1165.70] mill graduate in there who all they know how to do is pump the stock price that that's not how you build
[1166.58 → 1172.58] a good fundamental business you have to actually understand what you're doing so yeah if you work
[1172.58 → 1177.06] at some creative agency sure you could have a marketing person sitting in the CEO's office why
[1177.06 → 1182.10] not because that's literally all you do if you're a YouTube company like we are you should have someone
[1182.10 → 1187.70] who actually lives and breathes it like I remember talking to i was actually talking to my wife about
[1187.70 → 1193.78] this I was like well if I die you know what's the plan, and she's like I feel like I would have a
[1193.78 → 1201.46] really hard time you know fulfilling those CEO duties because there are things that you know you
[1201.46 → 1206.18] get your hands dirty with that I haven't touched, and you've been doing it for 12 years and I'm like
[1206.18 → 1210.66] yeah, but we need to do something so you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna talk about the plan there is a
[1210.66 → 1216.42] plan i I don't like dwelling on it too much because you know it's like every time I talk about like
[1216.42 → 1220.58] wills and succession and like all that kind of stuff it makes me all down so I don't want to do
[1220.58 → 1225.30] that but um these are the kinds of conversations we've had to have and these are the sorts of things
[1225.30 → 1232.58] that we've had to be aware of is that you have to fundamentally understand all aspects of the business
[1232.58 → 1237.46] if you want to be CEO and if you don't get engineering you shouldn't be the CEO of intel now I don't
[1237.46 → 1244.74] know if their CFO has some engineering experience that I'm you know not privy to um I would imagine
[1244.74 → 1248.82] that being at a company like intel you'd pick up a thing or two here and there I mean I've learned
[1248.82 → 1254.90] more about cameras and film than I could have ever cared to know just hanging out with Brandon all day
[1254.90 → 1259.78] you're a small company though, and you hang out with Brandon all day and I've heard stories about intel
[1259.78 → 1266.50] that would lead me to believe that that might not be the case yes like I won't, I won't name them i
[1266.50 → 1271.06] think I've told this story on when show before but uh prominent streamer I remember having
[1271.06 → 1276.42] a conversation with this person uh where they were asked last minute to go give a presentation
[1276.42 → 1282.42] do you have you heard this story directly from the source right wonderful guy too wonderful guy
[1282.42 → 1286.02] wonderful guy can you tell this story so I can take a couple more bites of my noodles here
[1286.74 → 1294.34] I think I can tell it accurately so he was asked to uh go to intel and have a meeting with
[1294.34 → 1303.86] intel c level employees so, so chief of whatever um type employees uh and explain to them why their
[1305.06 → 1313.38] product is actually like why gamers even care at all because they didn't know and I think people
[1313.38 → 1319.38] internally at the company were like frustrated with trying to explain it for so long they tried to
[1319.38 → 1323.70] hire an outside source to come and explain it and as far as my understanding goes be like
[1324.98 → 1328.90] yeah did a pretty good job and thinks he did a pretty good job but doesn't really think that
[1328.90 → 1334.26] they took anything away from the best part is uh he told me that at one point one of them kind of
[1334.26 → 1339.62] put their hand up and interrupted and was like so you're saying that like this game streaming like
[1340.34 → 1345.46] the higher performance of our product you're using the better, and he's like yes
[1345.46 → 1354.02] I forgot that part that's the really right that's the best part that's the best part of the story
[1355.06 → 1364.82] and um oh yeah okay YouTube chats like bob swan is a career uh hold on a career and a career CFO
[1364.82 → 1371.38] with a MBA education all right well there you go see I would hope I would hope that at a company like
[1371.38 → 1375.94] intel you would try to you try to spend enough time talking to engineers that you could at least
[1375.94 → 1382.02] understand their challenges and their pain points you know what makes them tick what makes them talk
[1382.02 → 1388.98] you know uh you have to talk to them to see what makes them tick that's funny I'm a funny guy anyway
[1389.78 → 1397.70] um and that's something that you can do you can do as an executive that has an education in another
[1398.26 → 1403.14] space, but you have to force yourself to do it you can't just bury yourself in financials all day
[1404.26 → 1409.30] the good news is you know public company they have to file these earnings reports and all that you know
[1409.30 → 1414.98] eventually if they don't invest in the fundamentals of the business which is just so
[1414.98 → 1421.06] you're aware if you're watching making great processors um if you don't invest in the fundamentals
[1421.06 → 1425.22] of the business it will eventually bite you because you will have to admit that things are not
[1425.22 → 1438.82] going well yeah so like yeah I don't know yeah intel says i think part of the problem too is
[1438.82 → 1443.86] when you have those like super segmented things like to bring up the Brandon example which I think
[1443.86 → 1448.74] is a pretty good example you're saying you exist around Brandon long enough, and you're just going to
[1448.74 → 1454.26] know things about cameras totally, and you're probably going to start to care about them because like when
[1454.26 → 1459.78] you're when you're around someone that that is that passionate about effectively anything you're
[1460.34 → 1463.22] probably going to get some of that well you can't get them to shut up
[1464.50 → 1469.30] yeah and like he'll be so driven about it yeah that you'll like to see some article about something
[1469.94 → 1474.50] and you'll see like what he was talking about mentioned in the article, and suddenly you start to
[1474.50 → 1480.18] care and like enthusiasm gain some understanding enthusiasm is infectious and passion is infectious absolutely
[1480.18 → 1489.06] and when you're holed up as the CEO with all your marketing and CFO buddies in some office playing
[1489.06 → 1495.06] office golf and talking about whatever I have no idea I don't know what that life is like but when you do
[1495.06 → 1500.98] that you're around other people that are passionate about just like marketing and money and not the
[1500.98 → 1509.86] engineering and the really insane technologies that go into this stuff you like need that around you because
[1509.86 → 1516.66] that influences your leadership can can we just talk about golf for a minute like can I okay
[1516.66 → 1523.78] here's a here's a golf hot take right and to be clear I respect the athleticism of golf you know like
[1523.78 → 1529.46] watching golf highlights is probably more mind-blowing to me than like football highlights to be honest with
[1529.46 → 1537.22] you like when I watch them sink a chip in from like 70 yards away and literally like the flag's still in the
[1537.22 → 1542.90] the hole floats and curves and does yeah like literally the flag is like in the hole still
[1542.90 → 1547.14] because they're so far away they need it to see the hole, and they get it in the hole and I'm like
[1547.14 → 1553.86] how is that even possible like I could hit that ball I could have a million monkeys with a million golf clubs
[1554.42 → 1558.90] for a million years and none of them would ever get the ball in the hole like that it's amazing its
[1558.90 → 1566.10] incredible but recreational golf can I just come out here and say that it appears to be designed to be
[1566.10 → 1575.78] as astronomical a waste of time as possible i think I was uh I was watching actually uh nothing
[1575.78 → 1582.90] the like counterstrike player and commentator and internet personality person great dude I was I i very
[1582.90 → 1587.62] very rarely go on Instagram but I went on Instagram because I got a notification that a couple of my
[1587.62 → 1592.58] buddies had posted things like real life friends and I clicked on it is brought me right away to his
[1593.14 → 1600.50] story, and he was out golfing um and I flipped through it pretty quickly, and it was stunning they
[1600.50 → 1606.18] were on the coast it's beautiful golf course all along the coast, and he just looked really relaxed
[1606.18 → 1610.58] and he kept on mentioning how like the scenery was great, and it just seemed like it was almost
[1610.58 → 1619.94] like a spa day as far as I can tell the point of golf is to say hey look at me, it's the middle of the
[1619.94 → 1627.06] afternoon and I have nowhere else to be and nothing better to do than spending my time accomplishing
[1627.06 → 1634.58] quite literally absolutely nothing and get this I am paying 10 times more for the privilege per year
[1634.58 → 1643.14] than you make in 10. I think as far as I can tell that's the whole point of golf it's the ultimate flex
[1643.70 → 1652.58] some like weird side thought experiment thing that I've tried to figure out for a very long time is why
[1653.78 → 1663.06] basically every single U.S. president has been obsessed with spending as much time golfing as they can
[1663.06 → 1670.58] okay so um I've heard some theories about that I've heard some theories, but they're from like kind
[1670.58 → 1675.22] of crazy people yeah so I'm not sure how much credence to give them one theory I heard that
[1675.22 → 1680.90] sounded somewhat reasonable was that it's all about betting on golf that's that's so that's the main one
[1680.90 → 1688.02] I've heard too yeah so you get like a lobbyist type to go golfing with you, and then you bet on it and
[1688.02 → 1693.70] they throw the game and then suddenly it's not like campaign funds yeah it was a form of gambling
[1693.70 → 1700.34] and it gets like just shoved under the rug i just yeah I don't I don't know I don't know if I believe
[1700.34 → 1706.10] that to necessarily be true like as far as I can tell once you've been president um a lot of it is
[1706.10 → 1713.38] about doing talks and like doing the whole speaking tour thing after the fact uh because you're worth like
[1713.38 → 1719.62] a quarter million to half a million dollars just to show up and talk okay yeah um I don't know like
[1719.62 → 1725.70] you're never going to be wanting for money again someone said skiing is more expensive not
[1725.70 → 1732.50] really not even close it can be pretty bad if you're is you're like getting a cabin up at somewhere like
[1732.50 → 1738.18] whistler for extended periods of time by that logic you could have a cabin at some place where
[1738.18 → 1746.10] there's a golf course you enjoy uh so it's its not really any different and like the cost and
[1746.10 → 1753.86] remember too I'm not talking going on some like ratty like you know public golf course when I talk
[1753.86 → 1759.30] about the price I'm talking about you know you are you have to be a member of the club already
[1760.26 → 1768.02] just to have the privilege of paying for a tea time and those places are not yeah cheap yeah like there's
[1768.02 → 1773.46] golf courses around us where you can go golfing for really cheap they're also 20 bucks or whatever
[1773.46 → 1780.26] I think in the eyes of golfers just complete junk I don't necessarily know why but yeah
[1781.22 → 1787.06] nick made a point of uh messaging me to say uh golf courses are usually attached to five-star hotels
[1787.06 → 1792.66] heck of a lot more expensive than a cabin yeah so there's that um good points, and you want to talk
[1793.38 → 1798.10] let's talk equipment okay let's talk equipment we're going off on like a total freaking tangent
[1798.10 → 1803.78] here so I'm gonna load up golf town is the only golf store that I'm aware of because there's one at
[1803.78 → 1811.06] like Coquitlam centre mall so skiing all right you can easily spend just like no you can easily spend a
[1811.06 → 1817.22] grand okay you can spend a grand on skis all right yeah you can spend 200 those are some pretty smoking
[1817.22 → 1823.94] yeah you can spend 250 on gloves like you can like a really amazing top of the line snowboards
[1823.94 → 1829.30] like 700 yeah like you can you don't you can spend you can get fashionable about your winter wear you
[1829.30 → 1834.02] know you can spend five thousand dollars or whatever you want on like your outfit but here's the thing
[1835.06 → 1840.26] with golf yeah well remember we're talking like designer like you know you go on if Louis Vuitton or
[1840.26 → 1848.10] whatever had one off it's like the one luxury brand I'm aware of do they have a ski suit okay you look
[1848.10 → 1857.46] that up while I have a look at okay so meanwhile in golf land one club is going to set you back 700 bucks
[1857.46 → 1863.94] don't forget you need a whole bag of them, and you don't want to be that peasant you know peasant garbage
[1863.94 → 1870.02] town pleb on the course that's got like you know the kit you know that's the equivalent of showing
[1870.02 → 1875.54] up on a job site with a Robin drill you know you don't do that right you want to be like the baller
[1875.54 → 1881.70] or whatever so you've you've got this entire bag oh, oh meanwhile hold on how much does a golf bag cost
[1881.70 → 1892.58] right uh bags and carts so just to interject yeah there is a shut up there is a patch ski jacket it's
[1892.58 → 1898.42] called patch ski jacket I think by patch they mean it looks like the most normal jacket in the world
[1898.42 → 1904.74] and then it has a Louis Vuitton patch on the side of it that's it and there's no listed price you have
[1904.74 → 1915.78] to call for an inquiry okay high fashion is so stupid meanwhile this is great I was trying to see if Louis
[1915.78 → 1920.74] Vuitton had a golf bag so that there was something equally stupid that you could invest in on this side
[1920.74 → 1926.82] and uh fortunately or unfortunately I'm not sure which I found something even dumber this is the
[1926.82 → 1936.98] Andrews golf kit okay um and initially I thought I was clicking on a golf bag because hold on
[1936.98 → 1942.74] just chill okay just chill I thought I was clicking on a bag because the price is a thousand
[1942.74 → 1950.02] dollars it turns out all it holds is whoops that's the wrong thing it turns out all it holds is a few balls
[1950.74 → 1959.70] and a couple of teas so no you do not in fact get a golf bag you just get a golf bag
[1959.70 → 1967.46] baggy oh my god oh that level of consumerism just like insults me I think oh no wait it turns out
[1967.46 → 1972.02] they do have golf bags here they are okay there you go, so these are going to cost you anywhere from
[1972.02 → 1980.50] 12 to 13 000 so um there you go there you go and to be clear I'm not singling out Louis Vuitton there's
[1980.50 → 1987.94] other equally ridiculous um there's other equally ridiculous brands that charge way too much for
[1987.94 → 1993.14] stuff uh someone in the chat said my ball bag is a worth way more than a thousand oh
[1993.14 → 2004.42] it's way more than a thousand well yeah wait they're balled but oh no, no okay well whatever the
[2004.42 → 2011.54] point is the point is no skiing is not more expensive than golf because golf is literally
[2011.54 → 2018.66] designed to show how much money and how much time you can waste because you have so much money and yet
[2018.66 → 2023.86] you don't have to work so you have all the time in the world to spend chatting it up on the golf course
[2023.86 → 2033.62] in the club or whatever the case may be um so there you go that's uh that's my hot take that's why you
[2033.62 → 2038.98] should spend time talking to your engineers instead of spending time playing golf there you go I don't
[2038.98 → 2044.66] know if bob swan plays golf uh we could find out easily enough with Google I would
[2046.90 → 2055.22] I feel like I'd bet money on it would you bet money on it, i just it's just so like pervasive
[2055.22 → 2062.66] in that community anyone with just like way too many millions probably seems to play golf I can't find
[2062.66 → 2068.90] I can't find anything about golf why would you know though like I don't know it's not on here
[2069.86 → 2076.26] it's not on here there's no mention whatsoever he's not like a president like I don't I don't
[2076.26 → 2081.06] think people are going to like to follow him around in that way you know uh I think we would still know
[2081.06 → 2085.62] he's enough of a public fee he's enough of a public figure that we'd probably know a fair bit a fair bit
[2085.62 → 2093.70] about his habits anyway let's move on for now um this is other big news NVIDIA allegedly is
[2093.70 → 2100.82] considering acquiring arm, so this is according to reporting by Bloomberg um NVIDIA has approached
[2100.82 → 2106.58] SoftBank arms parent company regarding a possible takeover deal, although other bidders may emerge as
[2106.58 → 2113.14] well SoftBank purchased arm holdings in 2016 for 32 billion which has been sort of um
[2114.90 → 2120.10] sort of doesn't look like a great deal at this point I think they're doing about 300 million in
[2120.10 → 2126.42] profit per year at the moment which means your 32 billion is going to take you an awful long time to
[2126.42 → 2132.10] make back if they even want to get what they paid for it um, and they're hoping to either earn a return on
[2132.10 → 2138.02] the investment by publicly listing arm or by selling it to the highest bidder uh they had a
[2138.02 → 2144.82] SoftBank had a form yeah okay uh, so there are some challenges here because there's definitely a lot of
[2144.82 → 2150.58] firms that might say oh wow it would sure be nice to own arm instead of just licensing the technology
[2150.58 → 2155.86] uh the initial reaction from a lot of people online was like oh you know maybe apple should just acquire
[2155.86 → 2166.50] arm, but that would be a regulatory nightmare I mean for apple to own the licensor of the technology that
[2166.50 → 2175.06] is fundamental to the survival of I mean okay which of apple's competitors would not consider
[2175.06 → 2183.86] their arm license to be essential to their survival at this point in time uh basically everyone and i
[2183.86 → 2187.70] suspect if it was coming down to a legal thing they would find a way to claim that regardless
[2189.86 → 2198.66] you know so that rules out apple realistically uh that rules out I mean really anyone else like that
[2198.66 → 2207.14] so that rules out your Samsung's and Huawei's of the world now if arm was a Chinese company there'd be
[2207.14 → 2211.70] nothing that would prevent uh the Chinese government from just kind of coming in and saying oh yeah sure
[2211.70 → 2219.06] Huawei you can acquire arm, and then you know haha take that the west um but uh arm would still be subject to
[2219.06 → 2227.14] um regulators in the UK because that is where they're based, so there's no way that a western power like
[2227.14 → 2233.14] the like the UK is going to say oh yeah sure china uh why don't you just have all the intellectual property
[2233.14 → 2241.30] so don't see don't see that happening um NVIDIA was pitched as one that might try to make a play
[2241.30 → 2249.94] so NVIDIA definitely utilizes arm technology, but they're not um very nice Luke by the way very nice
[2249.94 → 2257.14] lttstore.com the big water bottles are selling like crazy right now guys they're awesome so the c shipment
[2257.14 → 2262.90] is not arriving for a few more weeks um we had a big uptick in orders during that last stream and i
[2262.90 → 2267.62] think we are probably going to be out of stock of some of the more popular colours within the next
[2267.62 → 2272.02] uh few days to a week so if you guys want to make sure you get the colour that you want I would
[2272.02 → 2276.90] definitely go to ltdstore.com get an order in for the 40 ounce water bottle uh maybe grab a stealth
[2276.90 → 2282.34] hoodie or whatever while you're at it um it's been it's been infectious in my house literally everyone
[2282.34 → 2288.74] here uses one daily nice it's yeah it's the right size now we should have done a bigger one
[2288.74 → 2293.94] earlier we definitely should have the little one still has a place absolutely in your bike like in
[2293.94 → 2298.98] your bike water bottle holder or whatever yeah more on the go, but the big one like I only take the big
[2298.98 → 2305.46] one when I go to play badminton and stuff now it's its a huge difference um anyway so NVIDIA does
[2305.46 → 2311.06] license arm technology they use it for their like self-driving car platform stuff like that uh they use it
[2311.06 → 2320.34] in their switch chip, but they also don't license it in any spaces where they are directly competing
[2320.34 → 2328.90] with customers at least not significantly so if I'm apple I'm not real stoked on NVIDIA
[2328.90 → 2335.62] acquiring arm those two do not exactly have a great relationship, but the good news is that apple's
[2335.62 → 2340.90] license arm does offer a perpetual license for their uh for their instruction set
[2340.90 → 2346.82] so apple has a perpetual one for that they're already using their own custom silicon so they
[2346.82 → 2353.86] don't even just use uh arms you know standard cortex cores or anything like that so it probably makes no
[2353.86 → 2360.82] difference to them whatsoever going forward you know what who owns arm uh so that was sort
[2360.82 → 2366.26] of some of the back and forth that was going on over this deal uh i honestly just don't know
[2366.26 → 2371.30] I don't know i kind of don't really know why anyone would want it like if you're is the revenue
[2371.30 → 2376.42] is so low compared to what SoftBank is probably expecting to get for it how could it be how could
[2376.42 → 2382.98] it is worthwhile unless you see arm you know kind of going to the moon in the next five years, but they're
[2382.98 → 2387.86] going to be under significant pressure from risk five like if anything arm might have peaked
[2387.86 → 2401.62] peak peak peak arm you know yeah risk five will be interesting if it really does pop off um but I think
[2401.62 → 2406.02] I think controlling that space has value you can always change licensing fees as well
[2407.70 → 2413.86] like they could make it profitable in like a somewhat predatory way but if they tried to do that
[2413.86 → 2421.70] they put themselves at much greater risk of being overtaken by risk five as it is if the licensing
[2421.70 → 2426.74] stays inexpensive and there's just no reason to use anything other than arm will they maintain their
[2426.74 → 2437.62] position speaking of that would be a really, really long-term play but I guess if you tried to maintain
[2437.62 → 2443.78] that until the point where risk five maybe gets outpaced then you could increase rates later, but that's
[2443.78 → 2451.06] really long-term play t edge says you're missing the whole point of golf I do it with buddies to have
[2451.06 → 2457.38] a good time while sharing a couple beers my bro does to relax from anxiety that's basically what I said
[2459.86 → 2466.74] it's a waste of time and to be clear like you know by that logic you know relaxing isn't tight and like
[2466.74 → 2473.62] it's if they suffer from rather severe anxiety relaxing is not a waste of time sure how about this
[2473.62 → 2480.90] it's not productive there what if and I'm not productive every moment of the day makes you
[2480.90 → 2485.78] less productive than if you would have just relaxed and then not had the anxiety yeah, yeah so that's
[2485.78 → 2489.86] fine you could have a net benefit from it, I'm not saying there's no health or psychological benefits to
[2489.86 → 2498.58] it I already said it was fun it's just there are much more um efficient ways to have fun as well
[2499.22 → 2502.58] that's all that's all that's all that's all I'm gonna that's all I'm going to say that's all I'm gonna
[2502.58 → 2507.30] say about it, I'm not I'm not getting drawn back into this what I am getting drawn back into is this

[2650.90 → 2658.18] uh there was a twitter thread a while back um where someone took their free time during
[2658.18 → 2667.46] covid while they were stuck at home and figured out the exact viewing order of every single to the
[2667.46 → 2676.82] second part of every single movie in the marvel MCU and I realized marvel you know whatever
[2676.82 → 2683.22] marvel MCU um more explanatory that way uh they figured out how you would have to watch it to
[2683.22 → 2689.54] watch every single part of that thing in chronological order right because just to be
[2689.54 → 2695.22] clear guys if you don't know this already some of the movies actually have scenes that flash back or
[2695.22 → 2703.38] flash forward or that are taking place at the same time um so to watch every scene in order is does that
[2703.38 → 2712.90] super cut exist uh it does what would that be that would be like a terabyte that more it's
[2712.90 → 2718.90] that would be like 10 to dp i think it's like if I remember correctly I think it's like 40
[2718.90 → 2724.42] something hours that's hilarious I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't download that because I don't
[2724.42 → 2730.58] actually I don't actually own all the marvel movies most of them I've only seen once because it would be
[2730.58 → 2736.10] pirating hmm not if I own them all and I don't care I mean I've talked about that on the show
[2736.10 → 2743.46] before if I own all the Blu-rays um whatever I'm gonna just I mean 1080p i whatever I might flag you
[2743.46 → 2749.22] unless you have Pia uh I don't know what you're talking yeah I don't know what you're talking about
[2749.22 → 2753.86] either it doesn't matter yeah the point is i I wouldn't download it I don't have all the marvel
[2753.86 → 2759.38] movies most of them I have only seen one time in the theatre that was it like they're I like i
[2759.38 → 2765.54] haven't even seen most of them one time i I do love them I love me a good superhero flick I enjoy them
[2765.54 → 2773.30] but it's like it's like brain it's like brain off ship go boom time for me like the amount
[2773.30 → 2781.38] the amount of analysis that some people do on MCU movies is like wow it would have to be Star Wars for
[2781.38 → 2786.50] me to actually care this much and I don't even care about that anymore like I'm so over it I'm sure
[2786.50 → 2792.82] there are people that that care that much about those like i just i I cared about them for
[2792.82 → 2801.06] the first while the original Iron Man was like really awesome when it came out um and like I'm sure
[2801.06 → 2808.34] they've just gotten bigger and better over time but like I'm just I just don't care anymore I don't go
[2808.34 → 2814.26] see them anymore they're so they feel so cookie cutter now I don't know I still enjoy uh I still
[2814.26 → 2821.54] enjoy me some loki or dark fate or whatever the like really comedic one you know a lot of
[2821.54 → 2826.26] people regard that the which one's the super comedic one it's the second one right
[2827.30 → 2831.54] I think so the second Thor movie yeah I think so I think so I quite enjoyed it a lot of people
[2831.54 → 2837.70] regard it as like the worst MCU movie I think they're bananas um there's definitely worse
[2837.70 → 2843.54] ones but anyway or Ragnarök yeah Ragnarök I quite enjoyed Ragnarök didn't take itself too
[2843.54 → 2849.30] seriously um yeah yeah I forget what I was I forgot what I was talking oh yeah right I was this is like
[2849.30 → 2853.06] the least popular part of wan show guys just stick around we'll talk about tech again in a minute just
[2853.06 → 2860.90] bear with me okay Star Wars so I was just reading like these are books that I read as a young
[2860.90 → 2866.66] teen and um as a young adult and sorry as a teen and as a young adult um so I was already like
[2866.66 → 2872.58] familiar with the stories but I was like reading the like biography like uh summary on Cookiepedia
[2872.58 → 2880.26] for whatever reason for Jason solo a ret conned uh expanded universe character or extended universe
[2880.26 → 2884.34] I forget if it's extended or expanded it doesn't matter both fundamentally the same thing um let's
[2884.34 → 2891.46] say expanded okay so an EU character and I was reading through it and i just I had to put it down
[2891.46 → 2898.66] on because I was just like this is so much better so much more interesting this is so much more I bet
[2898.66 → 2905.70] you to uh to a big degree because that was a timothy Hahn character right uh Jason solo I can't remember
[2905.70 → 2910.50] I want to say I want to say yes and then the ones that i really uh I really enjoyed when I was quite
[2910.50 → 2916.34] young were the young Jedi knight series um about their adventures while their while they're training
[2916.34 → 2924.10] uh so that's Kevin Anderson and uh Rebecca what's her name I can't remember um anyway point is
[2924.10 → 2929.06] point is I was reading through it and I was like yeah you know what this is pretty trashy b-tier
[2929.06 → 2935.54] literature if we're being honest about it, you know this is not a lot of the Star Wars books were
[2935.54 → 2942.58] kind of yeah yeah this it's its it's its sci-fi you know let's be honest sci-fi is never going to be
[2942.58 → 2951.30] it's never going to win you an Oscar you know um not dune exactly exactly exactly so I was reading
[2951.30 → 2956.26] through it going like yeah it kind of reads like a soap opera but like that was the whole point star
[2956.26 → 2963.46] wars was supposed to be space opera like plot twist that he's his father you know like to come on
[2964.34 → 2969.86] but that's what made it great and so the the biography of this character is like you know and
[2969.86 → 2975.62] then he was kidnapped, and then he had to go here and then there was a assassination attempt and
[2975.62 → 2981.46] than this and then that, and it's like nobody lives a life that's that exciting, but that's fine it's fine
[2982.42 → 2993.06] and it's way better than wimpy boy brat angry tantrum Kylo Ren like maybe red I'm going to break the computer
[2993.06 → 2999.22] and that's like my favourite scene he's literally the angry German kid okay
[3002.42 → 3008.82] do you know that meme I think so the where he smashes the computer right when playing counter
[3008.82 → 3013.38] strike is that what you're talking about yeah are you going that far back yeah yeah yeah hold on where's
[3013.38 → 3029.14] the original here we go here we go hold on a second let's get this
[3029.14 → 3040.66] all right that's Kylo Ren in a nutshell okay take that to the bank
[3042.74 → 3047.30] ah brilliant google just signed me out in the middle of like live-streaming thank you I didn't
[3047.30 → 3054.18] need access to my important document anyway so I can actually talk about tech news now I don't I
[3054.18 → 3060.42] I think you cut it off before he like really goes ham yeah he like smashes his keyboard I think he
[3060.42 → 3067.86] like uses like it gets crazy um as far as I've heard in later years it was all staged yeah 100
[3067.86 → 3074.18] fake I mean when I was a kid i I was convinced he was that passionate about that game um but
[3075.14 → 3080.18] yeah that's pretty much it that's a classic right there you know what maybe when you're a kid you might
[3080.18 → 3086.50] be convinced that Kylo Ren's a good character yeah, yeah maybe oh wow that's uh oh I hadn't even
[3086.50 → 3089.46] thought about it that way Kylo and jar
[3092.18 → 3096.58] dude darth jar would have been a better character you see all the rumours circulating that
[3096.58 → 3101.38] Kathleen Kennedy is going out and George Lucas is coming back in dude that would be so sick I don't
[3101.38 → 3108.10] even think it would, I think it might, it's easy it's easy to say oh I want George back while we don't
[3108.10 → 3112.82] have him but I think we're going to get him back no we're going to get him back, and it's going to be like
[3112.82 → 3117.30] a dedicated movie about the walls or whatever, and we're going to be like what the hell is this
[3121.06 → 3125.86] i think if he came back and who was actually at the helm was Dave felony
[3125.86 → 3134.66] yeah but like creative the problem is the problem is because like George Lucas helped with the clone
[3134.66 → 3141.38] wars he helped with a lot of the character direction he helped with a lot of like the rules of that
[3141.38 → 3148.98] uh, uh of that series like he had a lot of influence on that but it was run by different people and i
[3148.98 → 3153.14] think if that was kind of the direction that it went in I think it would be good because his some of his
[3153.14 → 3158.50] creative vision some of his character creation stuff like that is perfect that's true I love
[3158.50 → 3166.82] his creativity or the world yeah we can uh we cannot go that direction I love his creativity
[3166.82 → 3173.54] I hate it when he writes dialogue um I hate it when he is stubborn about things uh and can't admit that
[3173.54 → 3179.30] he made a mistake that's something that really seems to have become or was always I don't know like a flaw
[3179.30 → 3185.06] in his character at some point or another like he uh he kind of ret conned the trade federation
[3185.06 → 3190.26] because it was just kind of complicated and didn't really make any sense in clone wars, but it's like
[3190.26 → 3197.62] okay can you just can, you just say it was a mistake then like can we yeah so it just you just end up with
[3198.26 → 3202.42] continuity that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and it's like well who cares anyway I guess it's some
[3202.42 → 3207.94] people's attitude but a lot of people that's sort of the point a lot of people care um okay let's talk
[3207.94 → 3212.58] about at t scaring customers into buying new phones there's a squirrel on my roof um earlier
[3212.58 → 3216.74] this week at t decided it was a good time to send out an email blast claiming that many customers
[3216.74 → 3220.98] phones are not compatible with their new network and that they would need to replace them to continue
[3220.98 → 3225.70] receiving service the email conveniently does not include what the actual change is or when it will
[3225.70 → 3230.90] take place but is worded very urgently some users even posted on the at t forum wondering if it was a
[3230.90 → 3236.82] scam I've actually got it looks like one to be honest it does kind of look like one update needed
[3236.82 → 3241.14] we'll soon be upgrading our network to use the latest whatever so if you click the learn
[3241.14 → 3246.26] more it reveals a support article detailing the shutdown of their get this 3g network
[3248.90 → 3259.06] which isn't even happening until February 2022 that is 18 months from now yeah so with the 3g
[3259.06 → 3265.38] network shutting down you're not going to be able to use your um iPhone 3gs I guess on the at t network
[3265.38 → 3275.62] I don't think too many people are still using those uh at t will whitelist uh was this sent out to
[3275.62 → 3282.02] everyone though or was this only sent out to people using phones that are not compatible because it i
[3282.02 → 3287.62] think it would just be people using phones that aren't compatible but your device it was sent out to
[3287.62 → 3292.90] people that it's not compatible that it's not going to be compatible with, but they've got 18 months 18
[3292.90 → 3302.26] months for sure if you're still using a 3gs now you might not care that's true but like an 18
[3302.26 → 3309.46] month update cycle might be pretty standard for a lot of people but if you're still on a 3gs it's not
[3309.46 → 3314.82] I just mean clearly it's your not in a hurry to have the latest and greatest so you might as well wait
[3314.82 → 3319.78] until the day before they drop the support then I just think 18 months is an awful lot of time and
[3319.78 → 3325.86] it's not particularly urgent that's all I'm trying to say doesn't seem urgent I'm interested in is
[3325.86 → 3332.90] that really what a like a 3gs era phone would look like the UI
[3336.98 → 3343.30] I know literally all we can see is like the top notification bar oh no the swipe up neither of those
[3343.30 → 3349.62] are correct unless these were like forwarded to someone else I'm actually not sure if it could be to
[3349.62 → 3354.90] the account holder, and maybe they have like a kid or something yeah yeah that's on their account or
[3354.90 → 3360.50] whatever there's a hundred reasons you might have this on a different device that's fair yeah anyway uh
[3360.50 → 3365.78] the email also detailed how AT&T makes getting a new device online easy, and they even offer free shipping
[3365.78 → 3373.06] yay uh there's one other thing we promised to get through uh this was posted by pickles lord of the
[3373.06 → 3378.10] jar on the forum the original article is from Ars Technica more than a thousand unsecured databases
[3378.10 → 3383.06] so far have been permanently deleted in an ongoing attack that leaves the word meow as the only calling
[3383.06 → 3389.38] card the attack first came to the attention of researcher bob Dickens on Tuesday when he discovered a
[3389.38 → 3395.46] database that scored stored user details of the UFO VPN had been destroyed UFO VPN had already been in the
[3395.46 → 3399.78] news that day because the word readable database exposed a wealth of sensitive user information
[3401.46 → 3408.50] oh and in a lot of ways and there is a note here that says is this like vigilante justice that
[3408.50 → 3415.54] calls the herd makes it stronger in a lot of ways if what this person or group is doing is going around
[3415.54 → 3421.14] and deleting databases and just leaving the meow calling card instead of copying them or trying to
[3421.14 → 3422.42] sell them or doing something like that
[3422.42 → 3430.26] yeah maybe like that sucks that your database just got deleted but at least it didn't get looted
[3430.82 → 3436.66] which would be way worse unless it was looted and deleted Dickens said I think in most cases
[3436.66 → 3440.98] malicious actors behind the attacks do it just for fun because they can and because it's really simple
[3440.98 → 3446.58] to do ouch I think that's probably true in a lot of ways for a lot of these different types of
[3446.58 → 3452.74] um hacks in general get Shrek all right we got to get through a couple super chats before I have my
[3452.74 → 3458.26] uh badminton session uh Robert mail says if intel releases seven nanometers before the end of 2022
[3458.26 → 3462.98] I'll eat whatever LTT store that you guys have out at that time I'm going to make sure we have a sombrero Robert
[3464.66 → 3472.98] a big one big sombrero you need to set like a calendar reminder for this hold that guy to it uh me at
[3472.98 → 3477.86] says re YouTubers complaining about cancel culture Linus you're a good dude who treats all with respect
[3477.86 → 3483.22] you have nothing to worry about I have not been respectful to every person at every point in my life
[3483.22 → 3490.66] and actually there was a very good point brought up by tasty pc um about a wan show segment that I did
[3490.66 → 3496.58] that was not very respectful and I'm not going to defend anything I did I looking back on it there are
[3496.58 → 3502.58] definitely things that I can see where I was thinking but did not express correctly i definitely
[3502.58 → 3510.10] thought that by highlighting the channel at all we were driving exposure to her, you know the I wasn't
[3510.10 → 3517.38] you know trying to undermine her as like I wouldn't basically my policy then and now is anyone
[3517.38 → 3526.02] I don't respect or anyone that I don't want to grow I will not even say their name I will not invoke
[3526.02 → 3532.58] their name because I'm in a position where if I mention them they win if I say something positive
[3532.58 → 3539.06] they win uh like modern social stuff as a whole you look at a lot of different other sections like
[3539.06 → 3545.38] the computer hardware people seem to stay very much away from this but a lot of other sections of YouTube
[3545.38 → 3553.46] create intentionally fake orchestrated drama absolutely all the time because it drives uh viewership
[3553.46 → 3560.90] and subscriptions and and and traction across all channels involved um so like not talking about
[3560.90 → 3565.78] someone is an it's a much more effective way of getting them to go away so I'm not going to defend
[3565.78 → 3571.78] it I was rude, and it was wrong um yeah i apologized to my wife too because I was like that
[3571.78 → 3577.22] was that was pretty rude not just to Lauren but in general um you know you shouldn't have you shouldn't
[3577.22 → 3586.18] have your husband out there like being rude because I mean obviously she's not responsible for my actions
[3586.18 → 3591.54] but I think you know when you're when you're life partners you reflect on each other yeah there's
[3591.54 → 3598.26] nothing you can really do about it so um yep i I've dealt with it but uh yeah it wasn't it wasn't right
[3598.26 → 3604.58] and uh hopefully I think anyway the point is I'm just saying no I'm not perfect anybody is
[3605.30 → 3611.70] so thankfully Lauren was a class act about it and uh you know thanks to her for that absolutely yep
[3611.70 → 3616.26] all right uh Tommy gun says will there be another scrapyard war secret shopper or tech showdown um
[3616.26 → 3621.86] secret shopper confirmed today uh brand is going to be our sponsor there you go it's happening nice
[3622.50 → 3627.46] nice uh pro Robert was really cool so that's exciting it's going to be awesome pro Robert uh can you do a
[3627.46 → 3634.66] video using liquid metal in a 2080 ti um based on the timing probably not maybe stay uh maybe we'll
[3634.66 → 3639.54] wait for something else to come out um not that I know anything I actually don't uh, but there are
[3639.54 → 3645.94] lots of rumours and usually when that happens it's uh yeah IAN melter does the new 40 ounce Ltd water
[3645.94 → 3651.46] bottle fit in the side pocket of the moss pack Grande has it been tested i I think Nick posted about it on
[3651.46 → 3655.94] twitter don't quote me on that one though I think he did if you tag him he should be able to let you know
[3657.46 → 3664.98] uh shadow says first time catching the wan show live would love uh what would intel do merch item
[3664.98 → 3671.94] I don't think we're going to do that I don't think to be clear i we still work with intel we still love
[3671.94 → 3677.78] all of our contacts at intel are all great like we love working with intel it's just the people who are
[3677.78 → 3682.26] making decisions that are not talking to the people we work with that's the problem that's where they
[3682.26 → 3689.54] run into trouble I have people that I would consider friends that I think are super cool we have a
[3689.54 → 3694.90] sick I love hanging out with we have a sick new sponsored series coming with intel uh intel is
[3694.90 → 3703.86] sponsoring 24 videos where we are going to be going through one by one once a month and doing 5 000 us
[3703.86 → 3712.90] dollar setup upgrades with the leg staff wow yeah like Geez yeah and that's pretty cool, and they're
[3712.90 → 3718.98] even being like crazy chill about the intel inclusions we don't have to we don't have to talk about intel
[3718.98 → 3723.62] constantly or anything like that they're like no we just you know if you want to use uh if you want to
[3723.62 → 3730.90] use the products that's great all we care about is that some intel technology is somehow central to the
[3730.90 → 3735.30] experience they're trying to have and with our staff that's easy so Anthony is going to be the
[3735.30 → 3741.70] first one we actually shot that today it's going to be a home theatre slash VR gaming setup so obviously
[3741.70 → 3746.42] the pc is at the heart of it he went with the core i5 he really liked it for its high clock speeds for
[3746.42 → 3755.14] VR gaming which is critical for VR um he got a like a new Apple TV great big Vizio TV uh he got a soundbar
[3755.14 → 3759.78] it's its absolutely sick it's going to be a great video so it's basically me just me and Anthony like
[3759.78 → 3766.50] shooting for four hours um yeah you guys will enjoy it, but there are great guys at intel that
[3766.50 → 3771.14] like really get it and know how to make great content engage with the community it's just the
[3771.14 → 3776.90] ones it's the bad apples it's the bad apples Dina fox many shows ago someone wrote a letter asking you
[3776.90 → 3781.62] to fix the lower third you interpreted as the hexagon logo being cut off by a pixel but I believe the letter
[3781.62 → 3787.38] was actually asking to fix the pixel that isn't covered on the right side oh probably I'm sorry I can't
[3787.38 → 3795.54] look at that right now 225 perfect says uh golf is a good walk spoiled popularly attributed to mark
[3795.54 → 3800.98] twain but was first used in 1948 and twain died in 1910 still a good quote yeah indeed
[3805.46 → 3811.06] oh man okay what else we got here that I should probably go through t I just says you're missing
[3811.06 → 3815.30] the whole point oh we talked about this one nope forget it Landon says love the cardboard case video
[3815.30 → 3820.58] thank you we loved it too we actually had a lot of fun making that um
[3820.58 → 3821.30] um
[3826.74 → 3829.86] I think possessed lady and living offering those people oh man
[3831.86 → 3838.50] Andrew Wilhelm says Jason had an incredible story arc and Luke's EU story arc was light years ahead of
[3838.50 → 3845.38] Disney's take insert look at the way they massacred my boy meme absolutely pretty much yeah man they
[3845.38 → 3850.74] could have been like with all that EU stuff they could have just been making epic movie after epic
[3850.74 → 3856.18] movie for years and years and years and they just didn't they were just like let's see how
[3856.18 → 3863.14] hard we can screw this up thanks QWERTY 22 stuff like the uh clone wars gambit did you read any of those
[3863.14 → 3872.82] books i you know it's been so long I don't think they're basically stories of like Anakin and ken obi
[3873.86 → 3880.66] just going out and doing like really cool, and you know what maybe they're not the best written books
[3880.66 → 3884.82] ever but the like premise of the storyline and the mission and stuff that they're on were usually
[3884.82 → 3890.74] actually really cool yeah there were these like one-off like really intense missions that usually just
[3890.74 → 3895.86] Anakin and ken obi maybe some other side characters and whatnot yeah would go on and i I really enjoyed
[3895.86 → 3902.66] them um yeah opinion on bad batch news yeah there's a there's a new TV show I believe in 2021 coming
