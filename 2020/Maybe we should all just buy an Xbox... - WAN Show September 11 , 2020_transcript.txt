[0.00 --> 13.30]  and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen the only show that you tune into on Friday
[13.30 --> 17.74]  afternoons or evenings or Saturday mornings or I don't I don't know where the f*** you're from
[17.74 --> 22.42]  it doesn't matter it's not the point the point is you're tuned in now and that's a good thing
[22.42 --> 30.98]  we got a great show for you guys today uh including oh man we built the most amazing chair
[30.98 --> 39.02]  of all time and it actually ties in perfectly with the LTT store item that you and I were talking
[39.02 --> 45.78]  about earlier in the uh the the pre-stream stream that's over on float plane yeah all right we're
[45.78 --> 51.90]  also going to talk about the Xbox Series X and S including some discussion around whether
[51.90 --> 59.28]  like the PC is just you know DOA at this point because Luke I think I think there's an argument
[59.28 --> 63.28]  to be made we're gonna have to make we're gonna have to we're gonna have to have that discussion
[63.28 --> 68.58]  a real frank discussion right about now it's gonna be interesting uh-huh yep what else we got
[68.58 --> 78.92]  uh WD labels 7200 rpm drives as 5400 rpm class that's that's it's the kind of thing you wouldn't
[78.92 --> 87.38]  imagine getting in a lot of trouble over and yet they did we'll discuss that later also uh AMD news
[87.38 --> 96.26]  RDNA 2 and Zen 3 dates hey so we can speculate again see what is up with this the one show the one
[96.26 --> 104.72]  freaking show with all the tech news of this year okay like the biggest biggest tech news of the year
[104.72 --> 113.26]  and I'm I'm on a campsite with no internet even I can't even call into the show you know how bad I
[113.26 --> 119.36]  wanted to call into the show well I couldn't I couldn't call into the show and talk about the
[119.36 --> 126.22]  ampere announcement yeah I was I was so hyped up to to battle about that and you know you want to hear
[126.22 --> 132.90]  the worst part Luke you know how earlier on on the pre-stream I was like it's okay Luke because we can just
[132.90 --> 139.94]  discuss those things this week right you know we can just pretend it never happened last week I lied dude I
[139.94 --> 150.02]  lied I let you down because because I've seen the numbers now so I can't say anything oh I can't break my NDA
[150.02 --> 158.20]  so you can say whatever you want and I'm gonna have to sit here poker face pop pop pop poker face
[158.20 --> 163.16]  and pretend I have no idea what you're talking about can we agree about something can we can we
[163.16 --> 167.06]  we can discuss this part because it's not about the numbers sure that you mean the part where we roll
[167.06 --> 172.14]  the intro first yeah let's do that all right just a second all right you know what let's just start
[172.14 --> 177.10]  who cares I'll just I'll just mute the intro whatever whatever you know who cares anyway all right let's
[177.10 --> 183.02]  get this let's get this let's get this party started okay go ahead go ahead okay so I it it sounds great
[183.02 --> 190.30]  sounds fantastic speeds and feeds sound real cool they do give it to uh digital foundry and they showed
[190.30 --> 196.80]  some really cool stuff with it uh and nvidia's words that's that's not a lot of players in the space
[196.80 --> 202.36]  yeah that's literally zero well one one one okay digital foundry counts nvidia does not
[202.36 --> 209.10]  count yeah yeah I mean I love nvidia but like you know Luke you've dealt with nvidia a lot over the
[209.10 --> 214.54]  years how would you characterize nvidia's representations of their new graphics technology
[214.54 --> 221.86]  on on a scale of where one where one is like they basically hate themselves and everything they make
[221.86 --> 230.18]  and 10 is incredibly optimistic very optimistic you know our graphics cards walk on water and
[230.18 --> 235.84]  they come with a free leather jacket and could you live with yourself if you lived any more of your
[235.84 --> 246.52]  life without rt i don't know exactly what it was but yeah I uh I I just do you think people should
[246.52 --> 254.10]  reserve judgment for at the very least review more reviewers getting their hands on it okay so again
[254.10 --> 258.74]  I already have my hands on it so I can't I can't tip anything Luke I can't even tell you
[258.74 --> 265.12]  you know how this is you're not even in the organization anymore I can't tell you what I can
[265.12 --> 270.52]  tell you though is uh oh this is so funny okay I don't normally read super chats right away but
[270.52 --> 277.60]  robert mail says not sure why people are so hyped for amd 6000 series graphics I have an amd 7000 series
[277.60 --> 286.10]  in my basement if anyone wants it hey got them love it reusing reusing product numbers that's how
[286.10 --> 293.18]  that's how you get in trouble we should we should get our uh 8800 gtx's out okay those have got to be
[293.18 --> 299.28]  crazy so I'm so I'm gonna fall back on this I'm gonna fall back on the same advice that I give to
[299.28 --> 307.02]  anyone ever and that is that you should never pre-order so you should always wait for independent
[307.02 --> 314.36]  evaluation of anything you're buying whether it's a game or uh even a movie like there's movies that
[314.36 --> 322.14]  I guess I know I'm gonna go see without a review anyway but that's just me being a dumb blind fanboy
[322.14 --> 327.66]  and I gotta understand that I gotta I gotta just accept that um so if you're trying to not be a
[327.66 --> 332.94]  dumb blind fanboy then you should wait for independent analysis especially because something like a
[332.94 --> 338.62]  graphics card is so I'm not gonna say easy because it does take expertise in order to evaluate it
[338.62 --> 346.50]  properly um but it's so it's so objectively evaluatable right like an album or a movie
[346.50 --> 355.14]  it's so subjective whereas a graphics card I mean either it has lots of fps and is cheap or it like
[355.14 --> 362.80]  doesn't have many fps and is expensive like there's no way to yeah I mean okay I mean I guess back in the
[362.80 --> 368.40]  day when I this is kind of funny actually I forgot about this back when ATI when they existed and
[368.40 --> 374.48]  Nvidia used to play a lot more games with render quality in their drivers there was some argument
[374.48 --> 379.38]  to be made around you know one of them is is actually rendering the game at a higher fidelity even if the
[379.38 --> 385.82]  fps is lower but these days I think it's been all quite a while since anyone's been caught making those
[385.82 --> 391.64]  kinds of optimizations nowadays if they're you know upscaling the image that's not a bug that's a feature
[391.64 --> 400.78]  to be clear I'm not upscaling is downscaling yes I'm not knocking DLSS I'm not knocking DLSS I do
[400.78 --> 406.10]  consider that to be legitimately a feature I'm just it is absolutely pretty cool I'm just having a little
[406.10 --> 411.92]  fun I'm just having a little bit of fun at Nvidia's expense here so so that's what I'll say I'll say you
[411.92 --> 417.24]  should always wait for independent review what are you expecting because you legitimately don't know
[417.24 --> 423.72]  anything so you can say no sorry that came across wrong you legitimately don't have any inside
[423.72 --> 433.44]  knowledge on the RTX 3080 I think I'm expecting a lot I think I'm expecting a lot because and this
[433.44 --> 439.26]  this was where like a little bit more specifically what I wanted to talk to you about but I think I'm
[439.26 --> 448.00]  expecting a lot because the last launch was pretty lackluster so you're on the every other GPU launches bad
[448.00 --> 455.74]  kind of bandwagon here right now I don't know if that's necessarily been true just the other one was
[455.74 --> 464.30]  really bad so the pendulum must swing the other way was just kind of just kind of but well Nvidia hears you
[464.30 --> 468.98]  Nvidia hears you loud and clear I mean they made it very clear during the presentation that they were
[468.98 --> 477.64]  speaking directly to 1000 series owners please upgrade please okay and that's that's the other
[477.64 --> 487.52]  side of my thing is like I I the the the like oh my 1080 my my 2080 ti is garbage now okay if you could
[487.52 --> 492.34]  afford a 2080 ti maybe you genuinely think that way and the amount of money for the new card doesn't matter
[492.34 --> 497.06]  and it's fine but like a lot of people with 2000 series cards even though I think that that whole
[497.06 --> 504.72]  lineup was kind of but like you don't you almost certainly don't need to upgrade yeah I mean that's
[504.72 --> 511.16]  something that I actually it's it's so funny because I I come from a time like back when I was making
[511.16 --> 519.46]  enthusiast pc hardware purchases this happened all the time yeah like I look at that like it's people have
[519.46 --> 526.18]  almost been sort of um they've fallen into this false sense of security where if they if they buy
[526.18 --> 533.28]  a computer it's like still fast for three years that's bad that's not good that's not what we want
[533.28 --> 539.76]  you didn't you didn't win yeah we want them to get faster so that when it's time to upgrade
[539.76 --> 545.66]  you get a significant upgrade you know you're not upgrading from a 2600k
[545.66 --> 553.96]  to a 7700k and like yay here's my 18 more fps thank you intel like that's not that's not what
[553.96 --> 560.92]  we're after right as enthusiasts so I look at all the outrage over the 2000 series and I go look guys
[560.92 --> 567.50]  you gotta have a perspective check here and I get it there so there's some people out there Luke like
[567.50 --> 572.84]  you said where to them you know a 2080 ti is just pocket change anyway who cares like oh this is garbage
[572.84 --> 578.28]  I might as well give it to my little sister and get the new 3000 series but there's also people
[578.28 --> 583.96]  out there that scrimped and saved and scraped together potentially over the last two years
[583.96 --> 590.44]  that's when the 2080 ti launched two years ago to get real-time ray tracing only to discover they
[590.44 --> 595.92]  bought a card that's not even fast enough to run it at a modern resolution in almost any games
[595.92 --> 603.34]  yeah that launch was was lame and that sucks like that really sucks it does for sure but that yeah
[603.34 --> 609.38]  sorry keep going but your card's not garbage like I'm running a 2080 ti in my vr rag in my living room
[609.38 --> 617.52]  I'm not gonna swap it out not because I can't afford a 3000 series I I mean probably not right now just
[617.52 --> 624.50]  because these things are gonna be so tight really hard to buy really hard to find but sometime three
[624.50 --> 629.46]  months from now realistically like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sugarcoat it here guys it's not like
[629.46 --> 636.10]  I can't get hardware if I need it if I call up a gigabyte or asus or msi or zotac or pretty much you
[636.10 --> 646.06]  name it and I'm like hey sup I need an rtx they'll be like oh fine uh so so if I wanted to upgrade that
[646.06 --> 654.30]  system it's not even a matter of the money to me it's just like hold on a second what game is actually
[654.30 --> 662.02]  demanding more than what an rtx 2080 ti can can do like if I'm not actually trying to run real-time
[662.02 --> 670.98]  ray tracing at 4k that is still a fantastic powerful graphics card it is still going to be more powerful
[670.98 --> 679.06]  probably than the xbox series x and the playstation 5 like let's it's not gonna necessarily oh wait
[679.06 --> 684.80]  hold on a second yeah rtx 2080 ti is even getting direct storage so you will be able to leverage
[684.80 --> 692.46]  that direct access for the gpu to high-speed nvme storage on an rtx 2080 it's not a bad graphics card
[692.46 --> 697.50]  no it was it was kind of a bum release and like the whole kind of point of it didn't really pan out
[697.50 --> 702.50]  directly and all that kind of stuff but it's still very powerful especially for almost everything that
[702.50 --> 709.14]  almost everyone will use it exactly everyone's like oh flight sim 2020 okay get real how many of
[709.14 --> 716.00]  you actually play flight sim 2020 as like you're you get home at the end of the day and that's like
[716.00 --> 721.76]  the game you play and most of the like really intense flight simmers that I know and of course
[721.76 --> 726.80]  twitch chats could be like oh I do I do I do yeah okay fine fine fine most of the really intense flight
[726.80 --> 733.58]  simmers that that I know of are not gonna balk at getting a new card and they were like very likely
[733.58 --> 739.50]  gonna get the new card anyways so it doesn't matter and like something something that uh Linus and I
[739.50 --> 745.98]  have been talking about on this show probably since I'm assuming uh one of the first five episodes has
[745.98 --> 752.50]  been the idea of when when you're not necessarily even strapped for cash when you're trying to be
[752.50 --> 760.14]  strategic about your computer component purchasing and upgrading you flip that before the announcement
[760.14 --> 767.26]  yep yep because afterwards with that said the one time that that would have screwed you is if you
[767.26 --> 772.46]  flipped your 1000 series before the 2000 series announcement because you basically would have been
[772.46 --> 780.02]  stuck just like buying a more expensive graphics card for a small increase in performance even then you
[780.02 --> 783.82]  wouldn't have gotten screwed that bad like you might have lost a couple hundred bucks which is a lot less
[783.82 --> 788.18]  than you lost if you didn't flip your 2000 series just now a couple weeks ago
[788.18 --> 796.78]  yeah it's pretty rough but like there's a reason why we've always said that it's because it works and
[796.78 --> 800.84]  if you did that this time around you would not have lost that like huge amount of money
[800.84 --> 808.54]  bugatti boy 912 here says lol Linus gatekeeping flight sims now what are you even talking about I'm just
[808.54 --> 814.46]  being realistic like like here hold on hold on top I don't think I think that was saying it's it's
[814.46 --> 820.94]  unlikely that uh like like how many people even play is there steam stats on this top games twitch
[820.94 --> 827.30]  here hold on hold on just uh just a minute here so we got we got your fall guys uh okay sort by
[827.30 --> 831.56]  viewers hi to low here we go you got your among us you're just chatting your league of legends your
[831.56 --> 837.58]  grand theft grand theft auto 5 is still bigger than flight sim on twitch you got your fortnite I mean how
[837.58 --> 846.18]  old is that game why is it classified as a driving and racing game fortnite no grand theft auto 5
[846.18 --> 854.34]  oh what are they doing that is so stupid look at this driving racing game you guys claim to know
[854.34 --> 860.62]  gaming even I I know that's not right okay so hold on how far down how far down this list do we have
[860.62 --> 866.68]  to go to find flight sim and to be clear I'm not knocking flight sim I'm just saying that sim games
[866.68 --> 873.24]  are not mainstream and this is kind of like the same stupid arguments that you saw way back in the day
[873.24 --> 881.78]  like I'm talking back pentium 4 versus athlon 64 when people are like but my video encoding it's like
[881.78 --> 892.18]  please you are not a video encoding like back then like the the youtube space didn't exist yet like
[892.18 --> 901.52]  people were not in their basements on their their pentium 4s creating videos and yes a small handfuls but
[901.52 --> 908.26]  there's dozens of us a small handful of them were but for the vast majority of people who were trying
[908.26 --> 914.46]  to treat well this great advantage in video encoding as some kind of you know killer app for buying a
[914.46 --> 921.08]  pentium 4 versus an athlon 64 it was it was a completely fallacious argument like it just had
[921.08 --> 926.82]  nothing to do with anything because the majority of us are just going to go home fire up league of
[926.82 --> 933.60]  legends or fortnite or you know rocket league or whatever and get no advantage whatsoever from that
[933.60 --> 938.24]  hyper threading and there's been there's been a hundred different examples of this over the years
[938.24 --> 947.76]  i mean intel has been on the on the receiving end of this kind of um sort of uh favoritism towards
[947.76 --> 954.02]  their competitor more recently so intel right now is at a significant disadvantage in one of the most
[954.02 --> 960.14]  popular benchmarks out there cinebench compared to amd because amd just ships way more freaking
[960.14 --> 965.76]  processing cores for the dollar than intel does and intel's like but but but but nobody actually
[965.76 --> 975.12]  uses cinema 4d and it's like yeah i i know but it's really easy to run and it gives us a pretty
[975.12 --> 982.64]  sort of relatable and still legitimately real world look at multi-core performance which we can kind of
[982.64 --> 988.70]  extrapolate out to the future assuming that uh software developers learn to use multi-core processors
[988.70 --> 992.86]  better over the next you know five years that you might own that pc or 10 years that you might own
[992.86 --> 997.60]  that pc and we can say okay you know this is definitely something to consider when we look at
[997.60 --> 1002.58]  the value proposition of these two products i'm just i'm saying that in the case of flight sim
[1002.58 --> 1009.46]  flight sim is not going mainstream in the next five years or 10 years flight sim has had a steadily
[1009.46 --> 1017.30]  not very fast but steadily decreasing player count even with how new it is and its 24 hour peak is around
[1017.30 --> 1026.64]  10 000 so i'm not they are all watching this stream as far as i can tell so i'm so here hold on let's go
[1026.64 --> 1034.42]  back to the list here i'm not even i can't even make this stuff up hold on where is ctrl f sim okay
[1034.42 --> 1041.02]  hold on hold on ctrl f sim here we go ladies and gentlemen it's a really cool game we talked about on
[1041.02 --> 1046.96]  the wancho it it it looks beautiful and if you have one of those like a crazy jack system that can play
[1046.96 --> 1052.18]  it and maybe even a rig that you can sit in or and like manual controls and stuff really really cool
[1052.18 --> 1057.06]  setup you can take flight sim super far i also know people that run flight sims on lower settings on
[1057.06 --> 1062.82]  lower setup rigs and have tons of fun with it and that's absolutely fantastic it's just not really that
[1062.82 --> 1067.38]  big of a player base it's just not mainstream that's all so here hold on hold on i'm not done with
[1067.38 --> 1072.46]  this yet i'm not done beating this dead horse okay so we've got miscreated which is simulation we've
[1072.46 --> 1080.30]  got escape from tarkov which is a simulation fps and again a little less popular than uh fortnite
[1080.30 --> 1087.18]  just a little just by a little bit here uh because people don't generally want realism in their video
[1087.18 --> 1093.78]  games necessarily we've got daisy okay yep we've got vr chat we don't actually have anything that i would
[1093.78 --> 1101.16]  consider to be a straight up sim style game yet seven days to die what's next world of warships
[1101.16 --> 1107.66]  oh come on i mean it's pretty okay it's pretty simmy simmy combat i guess streamer life simulator
[1107.66 --> 1114.60]  streamer life simulator is literally more popular than flight sim 2020 although okay that's that's a
[1114.60 --> 1120.20]  bit of like uh what's that kind of bias called it's not confirmation bias but like sampling bias like
[1120.20 --> 1125.94]  we're sampling people who are viewing on twitch tv so and that could also have like one particular
[1125.94 --> 1130.26]  that's i don't know i haven't clicked on the category but a lot of times on twitch if you find
[1130.26 --> 1135.04]  like a smaller section that's oddly inflated for a moment it could be one bigger streamer just
[1135.04 --> 1139.36]  happened to play that game or do that thing for that amount of time all right let's move on let's
[1139.36 --> 1146.14]  move on though next up is the sims 4 a game from uh could you mind uh fact checking this for me luca what
[1146.14 --> 1150.08]  year is sims 4 from please uh hold on i'm just gonna work my way through the rest of the list
[1150.08 --> 1157.08]  here we've got space engineers whatever that is eco whatever that is animal crossing new horizons wow
[1157.08 --> 1163.36]  that's really fallen off a cliff hey does nobody care about animal crossing anymore uh i don't hear
[1163.36 --> 1168.90]  many people talk about it wow all right uh and it's more popular than flight sim 2020 we've got
[1168.90 --> 1177.28]  euro truck simulator 2 also ahead of flight sim 2020 and finally with 1.6 000 viewers flight simulator
[1177.28 --> 1188.72]  2020 wait holy crap that's not even 2020 shut up is this the old one no no no it might just be
[1188.72 --> 1194.70]  microsoft flight simulator it no no the this looks too good no this this has to actually be the new one
[1194.70 --> 1198.80]  it's called just microsoft that's that's the yeah i can barely see in the corner that's the cover
[1198.80 --> 1207.42]  that's the box okay okay i'm just i'm just making sure oof oof so sims 4 was released in 2014 in 2014
[1207.42 --> 1213.58]  all right i don't dive into it too far but sims the the sims fan base must be some of the most like abused
[1213.58 --> 1221.68]  fans of like any game they're actually cool games uh there i said it no but i mean i would never play
[1221.68 --> 1228.60]  them because they're for girls but i'm trying to be offensive i'm literally trying to offend everyone
[1228.60 --> 1234.86]  right now that is not my actual opinion they're cool games i i played i think sims won a bunch and
[1234.86 --> 1241.44]  actually had a lot of fun with it but like the um the time between releases is huge yeah the
[1241.44 --> 1248.90]  massive price that you have to pay for the extremely large amount of dlcs and all the dlcs is wild
[1248.90 --> 1254.68]  um like just i i don't know like especially financially i mean it's from ea so who's
[1254.68 --> 1259.94]  surprised but especially finance financially like ouch it would kind of suck to be a
[1259.94 --> 1268.40]  sims gamer yeah it's a little rough definitely definitely abused on the subject of being abused
[1268.40 --> 1276.60]  um let's see nope forget it i give up let's do something else let's do something else entirely
[1276.60 --> 1284.58]  xbox uh let's oh wait oh no i've got okay you know what no let's talk about the lttstore.com
[1284.58 --> 1291.18]  oh wait no no i lied okay uh here's what we're gonna do we're gonna talk about the chair video
[1291.18 --> 1296.20]  okay so this there's no notes in the doc or anything but you have i think you actually might
[1296.20 --> 1303.64]  have been the one who pitched this concept like years ago was it you water-cooled gamer
[1303.64 --> 1310.70]  i think that was me i think it was you okay so it's been years since luke has been at linus tech
[1310.70 --> 1318.10]  tips making videos but we are finally executing on some of his best ideas that quite honestly the
[1318.10 --> 1323.76]  reason we never did is because no offense luke but neither you nor i had the maker chops to do
[1323.76 --> 1330.16]  them properly we all saw what happened with the pizza pc that was you guys should seriously make
[1330.16 --> 1336.40]  a v2 we do need to do that we're going to actually good one it will be really cool yes yours was just
[1336.40 --> 1342.36]  astonishingly bad it was technically work it was a total misunderstanding it was a pass you completely
[1342.36 --> 1348.36]  misunderstood my pitch i was like look i wanted to keep the pizza warm and then i watched this video
[1348.36 --> 1354.68]  and you've got cold pizza and you're trying to heat it and i'm like oh my god nobody would do that
[1354.68 --> 1361.10]  but it kept it made it warm no but that means that it would keep it yeah but nobody would do that that's
[1361.10 --> 1369.20]  why they didn't get it they didn't get it luke they didn't get it they didn't understand the genius
[1369.20 --> 1375.40]  they didn't yeah well because you didn't understand my genius you made my genius look stupid
[1375.40 --> 1381.92]  anyway the point is you and i didn't have the maker chops to execute some of these ideas and
[1381.92 --> 1390.38]  that's fine i you know it's okay we can hire that so we did and colin was hard at work on water-cooled
[1390.38 --> 1398.44]  gamer finally guys do not miss this video because man i like i i can't stop gushing about it on camera
[1398.44 --> 1404.08]  during the video and i was talking to colin after and i was like yeah can i get this in my office and he's
[1404.08 --> 1409.70]  like i mean yeah i'm like yeah i'm like really warm because i was like shooting just now and i was
[1409.70 --> 1412.80]  like kind of running around i just ran up the stairs i'm like i'm gonna sit in my chair i'm
[1412.80 --> 1417.52]  gonna start immediately sweating and i i put it in my office anyway i like i talked to him later i'm
[1417.52 --> 1422.10]  like it's so amazing it's life-changing and he's like i thought you were just kind of hamming it up
[1422.10 --> 1428.12]  for the camera well like when we were shooting i'm like no this thing is every bit as good as i said
[1428.12 --> 1436.04]  it was on camera it's so great so okay okay no no you do you do you do you do i'm not even kidding
[1436.04 --> 1442.72]  you've already sold me like i would pay compared to like ergonomic chairs i mean you and i talked
[1442.72 --> 1449.34]  about ergonomic chairs on discord the other night just like yeah realistically ergonomic chairs are as
[1449.34 --> 1454.82]  much marketing bull as gaming chairs if we're all being honest you're gonna spice some of the audience
[1454.82 --> 1459.14]  there's there's well-made chairs and then there's like poorly made chairs and everything else is
[1459.14 --> 1464.02]  pretty much marketing so a bunch of people with their with their tushes and some erons just got
[1464.02 --> 1468.96]  quite offended yeah well i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry that you're ass but maybe if you bought a better
[1468.96 --> 1476.42]  chair then it wouldn't so let's get wrecked so before i would spend a thousand dollars or fifteen
[1476.42 --> 1482.80]  hundred dollars on like an ergo chair or whatever the case may be i would spend like i i wouldn't even
[1482.80 --> 1489.12]  consider spending that kind of money on a chair for a cooled one like the one colin built i would
[1489.12 --> 1495.50]  seriously consider it so let me talk you through it's not like this one it's got a foam back so this
[1495.50 --> 1501.28]  is an office master om5 which i do actually really like um but it's you know more it's more affordable
[1501.28 --> 1506.06]  chair it's like a few hundred dollars as opposed to like over a thousand dollars um so it's like a foam
[1506.06 --> 1512.14]  backed one and what colin did was he completely took the upholstery off he used a laser cutter
[1512.14 --> 1520.76]  with a defocused beam okay he intentionally defocused the beam so that it cut a three what was it
[1520.76 --> 1526.60]  what is this i i don't know i don't know about a centimeter three millimeter three millimeter i guess
[1526.60 --> 1534.24]  so whatever he cuts this channel and he goes over the path multiple times so what happens is he eats away
[1534.24 --> 1543.08]  some of the some of the foam um to make these like these like snaky tube channels yeah yeah yeah
[1543.08 --> 1551.12]  but without turning the foam crusty so he's got this like wide laser cut and because of the circular
[1551.12 --> 1558.26]  shape of the laser right it inherently cuts a little bit deeper in the center so the tubing actually goes
[1558.26 --> 1563.52]  in there perfectly he uses a little bit of foam safe glue to tack it in and he's like man he went
[1563.52 --> 1570.40]  so far like beyond the call of duty on this it's got like four passes on the one side four passes
[1570.40 --> 1576.52]  on the other he specifically left the spine free because a it's not going to be making contact if
[1576.52 --> 1581.58]  you're sitting properly in your chair anyway um and b it might not be comfortable to have your spine
[1581.58 --> 1586.66]  chilled and then he did the same thing in the seat so going back and forth back and forth and back and
[1586.66 --> 1590.96]  forth there are a few things i think we could do better and i go through it in the video but get this
[1590.96 --> 1597.42]  aside from there being water cooled tubes embedded in the foam and then put the upholstery back on
[1597.42 --> 1600.34]  it uses thermoelectric cooling
[1600.34 --> 1610.94]  that's pretty cool because think about it like we've talked endlessly about how bad tech cooling is
[1610.94 --> 1619.66]  right like yeah peltiers don't make a ton of sense for cpus and graphics cards because even though they
[1619.66 --> 1626.96]  can reach very low temperatures you know like minus 10 degrees looks really great on paper what they
[1626.96 --> 1634.46]  can't handle is really high heat loads typically and when you do have a very powerful peltier it's
[1634.46 --> 1644.50]  very inefficient but a human body is only around 100 to 120 watts so we ended up just recycling these
[1644.50 --> 1648.36]  very affordable like this is the kind of thing where even if we productized it you could go build
[1648.36 --> 1655.98]  your your own for not very much money um so we took these aquarium chillers with 300 watt peltiers on
[1655.98 --> 1661.26]  them we just completely recycled them actually just one of them and you sit in it and it's like
[1661.26 --> 1670.94]  life-changing it's life-changing i wonder if this would probably be a terrible idea um but i wonder
[1670.94 --> 1678.68]  if you could sell like kits i have no idea it's the kind of thing man it'd be it'd be tough because
[1678.68 --> 1683.94]  without like there's definitely some things that would need to be redesigned about a chair
[1683.94 --> 1689.98]  that really had this integrated from the ground up there actually is a chair that exists i forget what
[1689.98 --> 1696.52]  it's called but it looks i know it's terrible i bet you you could work with course i can just
[1696.52 --> 1700.78]  fling these ideas out now because who cares i'm not even part of it yeah it doesn't even matter
[1700.78 --> 1706.76]  yeah i bet you you could work with like a corsair because they have chairs right i'm not talking
[1706.76 --> 1713.10]  out of nowhere they have chairs and and okay maybe someone else based on that reaction but
[1713.10 --> 1720.84]  um you could probably work with someone to get the foam parts right and then cut them and then give the
[1720.84 --> 1726.28]  the tubing the peltiers everything in a kit and that person buys the chair maybe they buy the chair
[1726.28 --> 1730.88]  without even the seats on it and you guys could like literally finish the seats and they just put the
[1730.88 --> 1736.34]  seats there i don't know or uh or they could just like get the foam out of their seat and just insert
[1736.34 --> 1742.66]  what you had like you could work with a chair manufacturer yeah to get the stuff just be like
[1742.66 --> 1749.96]  because like a company like a corsair yeah or another company that's that's tied at least somewhat
[1749.96 --> 1756.98]  into computer memes at all that would blow up oh yeah i think it has i think it could be absolutely
[1756.98 --> 1761.14]  huge like it's honestly it's one of those things we probably won't have to do anything to get this
[1761.14 --> 1765.62]  productized because as soon as the video publishes every chair manufacturer and their dog
[1765.62 --> 1772.72]  is going to start trying to make a water-cooled chair because that's super cool um oscar chu says
[1772.72 --> 1778.86]  isn't this the same thing as warmers and chillers and high-end cars no so high-end cars use the hvac
[1778.86 --> 1783.56]  system that's built into your vehicle and they actually use refrigerated air and they blow that
[1783.56 --> 1792.86]  through the chair so same basic idea but because you don't have a forced air hvac system like
[1792.86 --> 1799.54]  strapped to your butt um it would not be practical to do it that way a peltier has the advantage of
[1799.54 --> 1807.98]  operating nearly silently it's just the cooling fan for it and um also being uh small so you can
[1807.98 --> 1812.58]  actually strap it realistically to a chair which is something that unless you're adam savage uh you're
[1812.58 --> 1819.46]  probably not going to build into you know something that you know fits onto your body yeah someone in
[1819.46 --> 1823.02]  uh chat said yeah but you have to have a cable running off your chair i think that's an extremely
[1823.02 --> 1827.68]  small price to pay and especially with like proper cable management it's not going to be a problem how
[1827.68 --> 1832.14]  often do you need to move your chair like that much especially yeah exactly you're going to scoot
[1832.14 --> 1836.24]  back you're going to scoot in that's like pretty much it yeah like if you if you have to play like
[1836.24 --> 1844.02]  chair racing then maybe you should grow up or just use a different cheaper worse chair yeah chair
[1844.02 --> 1850.74]  racing's fantastic get wrecked get wrecked you literally have a video of chair racing yeah i know
[1850.74 --> 1857.78]  by the way you weren't here last week one more thing i want to talk about from from last week's
[1857.78 --> 1868.04]  wanshow was uh have you heard about the uh mario kart yes i'm so jazzed of that video i'm so jazzed
[1868.04 --> 1874.58]  uh well no i just want to play mario kart irl like that looks like so much fun yeah but remember we
[1874.58 --> 1879.18]  we use the rc cars at the skate park you guys should do the same thing oh you should take him
[1879.18 --> 1882.46]  to the skate park like for channel super we should totally go back to the same place i love it that's
[1882.46 --> 1888.70]  what i'm saying yeah i love it we should totally do that so we could even have uh whoever's playing
[1888.70 --> 1892.40]  face away so they have to use like the camera on the car
[1892.40 --> 1899.60]  be pretty sweet speaking of channel super fun we've actually got a great one coming up do you
[1899.60 --> 1906.38]  know about this no okay channel super fun is not dead ladies and gentlemen dennis is determined like
[1906.38 --> 1912.66]  the corpse is lying there on the ground and he just he's just like hammering away at his chest beat heart
[1912.66 --> 1921.00]  beat um he's determined to keep it going anyway i've got i came up with i think an idea no one's ever
[1921.00 --> 1929.64]  done before which is really hard when it comes to pranks on the internet oh my we decided to steal
[1929.64 --> 1939.64]  the car of one of the people who works at the office and replace it with the exact same model vehicle
[1939.64 --> 1942.26]  and then see if they notice
[1942.26 --> 1946.26]  what
[1946.26 --> 1955.88]  okay i already put together all of that i'm pretty sure i think i know who would you notice
[1955.88 --> 1964.12]  would you notice if we swapped out your car for your car but like not quite your car and remember
[1964.12 --> 1969.88]  we we have time okay so we've got a couple hours with it so we can we can literally vacuum up your
[1969.88 --> 1976.38]  cracker crumbs and other crap on your carpet and throw it in the new one if you same model here
[1976.38 --> 1983.30]  same model here one like detail in my car which is like the logo on the steering wheel in the middle
[1983.30 --> 1987.94]  of the steering wheel yeah there's like minor damage to the left side of it would you notice that
[1987.94 --> 1993.08]  that was yes probably because it annoys me every time but it's it i bought it like that so there's
[1993.08 --> 1999.44]  nothing whatever but if you guys like even like temporary market on top of it and made it look
[1999.44 --> 2004.08]  similar it wouldn't even have to be that close yeah if in my periphery if it was similar probably
[2004.08 --> 2011.36]  not i bet you i wouldn't notice just being honest so yeah it's it's over on float plane already and
[2011.36 --> 2017.14]  it's probably worth a watch um pretty pretty fun video pretty fun video we've got another really
[2017.14 --> 2021.84]  good concept that's another sort of like i was wrong messing with who'd you think it was gonna be
[2021.84 --> 2025.88]  who'd you think it was gonna be well i don't want to say no no go ahead it's fine everyone's
[2025.88 --> 2032.96]  filling the chat with it anyway i thought it was gonna be brandon brandon because you got a model
[2032.96 --> 2040.06]  didn't you you bought your in-laws a model x he has a no no they got a model y and brandon would
[2040.06 --> 2045.52]  definitely notice if he had a model y all of a sudden yeah yeah yeah sorry i thought i thought you
[2045.52 --> 2051.46]  had gotten the same model so yeah my bad yeah no no so yeah we we ended up we ended up going with
[2051.46 --> 2056.26]  ivan and i'm not gonna spoil the ending though i'm not gonna spoil the ending it's definitely
[2056.26 --> 2062.64]  worth watching okay um all right so why don't we oh you know what we should probably talk uh sponsors

[2148.82 --> 2154.44]  want you want to probably we should probably talk about um okay ltt store real quick okay fine
[2154.44 --> 2162.72]  oh oh no what's happening hey sorry about that all right go ahead uh ltt store all right on your head
[2162.72 --> 2168.18]  no no no no there was a different thing there was a different thing oh this okay hold on so i had
[2168.18 --> 2172.98]  actually i had actually wanted to tie this in with the discussion about the chair because poor luke
[2172.98 --> 2177.68]  poor luke has no air conditioning over there right now because there's a bit of an air quality
[2177.68 --> 2184.44]  uh problem here in vancouver and his air conditioner is not the kind that just recirculates the air
[2184.44 --> 2191.46]  inside the building it actually filters air in and out of the building so i was he was like oh no i have
[2191.46 --> 2198.72]  to wear this i have to wear this new merch item uh all show and oh no it's a sweater and oh no i don't
[2198.72 --> 2204.34]  have my air conditioning and i just i just wanted him to put it on so that i could talk about how he
[2204.34 --> 2209.48]  doesn't have a water-cooled chair and how he's probably really warm right now we're not actually
[2209.48 --> 2213.10]  launching this sweater right now so that was it luke thanks
[2213.10 --> 2222.94]  when are you launching it uh later later some other time
[2222.94 --> 2231.46]  okay that makes way more sense because like why it's like the world is burning my ac's off so that
[2231.46 --> 2235.72]  there isn't more smoke in my house from the wildfires why are we releasing a sweater
[2235.72 --> 2241.48]  i was gonna support it i was there for you nick okay but i just didn't understand
[2241.48 --> 2249.66]  yeah um so okay well while you take it off i can tell the i can tell the story of uh oh it looks
[2249.66 --> 2254.68]  like flow plane uh stream is down for some reason that's very strange because youtube and twitch are
[2254.68 --> 2261.36]  both still live that's really unusual actually like not even not even just trying to be like
[2261.36 --> 2265.82]  hey flow plane it's so great that's actually very unusual the restreaming server is different than the
[2265.82 --> 2271.78]  other so it's not actually necessarily that weird oh hold on that seems to be back all right well
[2271.78 --> 2277.04]  that's fun uh anyway so let me tell you the story of why we're launching a sweater and actually do you
[2277.04 --> 2283.84]  want to just show the peeps why you want to why we're launching a sweater in uh in august september
[2283.84 --> 2290.64]  well actually it's so late that it's almost just a little bit early so it's meant to be just like a
[2290.64 --> 2297.96]  super kind of snuggly i didn't feel like getting dressed but i can't be seen in my pajamas type of
[2297.96 --> 2304.86]  like fleecy interior sweater it's really simple just clean branding i think we're going to launch it next
[2304.86 --> 2312.06]  week so in the meantime the only product that we have to uh pimp to you guys is the wrist warmers here
[2312.06 --> 2318.76]  that's what these are for right for warming your wrist yes particularly yeah keeping your wrist warm
[2318.76 --> 2324.86]  you know what not even kidding these made a big difference to my beat saber game
[2324.86 --> 2333.16]  think about it okay you got sweat on your arms you're whipping your hands your your hands around
[2333.16 --> 2335.72]  your sabers around where's the sweat gonna go
[2335.72 --> 2343.56]  you're whipping it around yeah actually that's yeah the sweat goes to your hand right yeah and
[2343.56 --> 2348.28]  what are controllers made of slippery plastic right
[2348.28 --> 2354.82]  so for the same reason that i wear them when i play badminton it's actually really helpful when i'm
[2354.82 --> 2360.70]  playing beat saber so yeah guys you gotta you gotta get yourself some ltt sweat bands up in here
[2360.70 --> 2365.54]  luke you really don't have to keep wearing that for realsies hold on my girlfriend who actually
[2365.54 --> 2371.68]  stole it and wore it before i was able to and is actually a huge fan of it even though it's not
[2371.68 --> 2375.66]  released yet i'm going to show a feature of it even though it's not coming out yet because linus is
[2375.66 --> 2382.12]  pranking me there's these like super slimline pockets on the side we can't see it there we go
[2382.12 --> 2388.26]  yeah they're like uh hidden kind of stealthy pockets super stealthy pockets kind of like totally
[2388.26 --> 2398.88]  wouldn't notice pretty cool you know what's really funny luke is jake was actually one of the biggest
[2398.88 --> 2407.46]  drivers of this product and the only two people outside of like uh like guys who work at lmg that
[2407.46 --> 2416.14]  have worn it and love it so far are yvonne and um planty time over there that's hilarious yeah
[2416.14 --> 2424.24]  it like it's like it's like obviously a guy cut but yvonne wears her she has a pre-production one
[2424.24 --> 2429.82]  she's had it for like months because we've been working on this forever um she wears it all the time
[2429.82 --> 2438.98]  like other than yeah i mean i nick nick dropped these off so funny last week and uh emma stole
[2438.98 --> 2445.78]  it like we can emma planty time whatever it's fine um she stole it like almost immediately i was just
[2445.78 --> 2454.82]  trying to promote the stream yo heck yeah planty time twitch tv she she asked me today if you guys
[2454.82 --> 2460.34]  could make merch for her stream for her stream because she likes she likes the merch that you
[2460.34 --> 2465.12]  guys make so much and she had a few people asking if she could get some merch items for them to get
[2465.12 --> 2473.58]  and i was like i uh you know what's really funny is we are we are straight up getting pretty close
[2473.58 --> 2481.34]  to opening creator warehouse up to more creators um currently there are four people who work there and
[2481.34 --> 2486.86]  we are posting six job postings in about the next week or so that's that's pretty wild i think you
[2486.86 --> 2493.16]  might have some like minimum order quantities you know what i think there's okay there's stuff that we
[2493.16 --> 2497.24]  could work with though so there's certain things where we'll be able to piggyback on our biggest
[2497.24 --> 2503.18]  customer which is obviously linus media group inc um and do alternate designs for other creators and
[2503.18 --> 2507.90]  get around minimum order quantities that way um there's also you know if they only want to make
[2507.90 --> 2513.58]  slight modifications to merch items that you know we've already done a lot of the design work on
[2513.58 --> 2520.28]  um if they want to just do a very small run that's something that is possible once we've got more
[2520.28 --> 2524.92]  designers on staff um it's something that we've invested really heavily in over the last couple
[2524.92 --> 2530.20]  years because we just identified this problem with merch that was out there and we're so tired of
[2530.20 --> 2535.92]  merch services that suck um that we were like okay well let's just spin this spin this up as a
[2535.92 --> 2541.40]  separate company like figure this out figure out merch sourcing and uh you know maybe if we do a
[2541.40 --> 2545.68]  good enough job other people will actually be interested it's great this is great because you
[2545.68 --> 2550.48]  taking you being in such a hurry to take it off is actually like the best endorsement i could ask for
[2550.48 --> 2557.56]  because it's a really warm sweater it's it's yeah it's not super bulky either it's like really
[2557.56 --> 2565.24]  uncomfortable to wear when it's warm it actually like feels thin but yeah it's yeah okay i have one last
[2565.24 --> 2574.02]  ltd store thing and this is really exciting guys if you bought a cpu pins design okay so
[2574.02 --> 2579.62]  if you bought one already it's it's too late if you didn't buy one because here's the thing
[2579.62 --> 2586.72]  we can't uh like we can't announce like a like a golden ticket type thing because then all of a sudden
[2586.72 --> 2591.86]  we're running a lottery but what i just you're really wonking now yeah what i decided we can do
[2591.86 --> 2598.00]  is we can print golden tickets and then tell you guys after the fact when it can't affect your
[2598.00 --> 2605.30]  purchase decision what happened so this shirt right here is the cpu pins design and you can see
[2605.30 --> 2610.40]  that some of the pins are open circles and some of them are closed circles and the closed circles make
[2610.40 --> 2616.58]  this ltd uh what we call our diamond logo in the middle of the bottom of the cpu
[2616.58 --> 2626.60]  if you bought one look very closely at it there are three out there that have a different design
[2626.60 --> 2634.42]  there are three one-offs out there with a different design in the pins and if you have one of them
[2634.42 --> 2641.66]  what you need to do is send us a picture via the ltd store support email of what it does say
[2641.66 --> 2650.58]  and you will win a gaming rig ridiculous yep rtx 3000 series equipped gaming rig it might take us
[2650.58 --> 2655.98]  a little while to get our hands on it because rtx 3000 but we will ship it to you if you got one
[2655.98 --> 2662.08]  of those shirts the next you guys should do like obviously you can't announce it yeah i can't promise
[2662.08 --> 2670.36]  anything else a genuine uh genuine golden ticket get you to like ltx and a tour of the office in the
[2670.36 --> 2677.24]  way that like that would be awesome did you see that the the i think is it the jelly belly guy
[2677.24 --> 2686.40]  is doing golden tickets right now and giving away a factory isn't that ridiculous so funny i just oh
[2686.40 --> 2694.24]  man the world is a weird place i know right it's like what stranger reality or fiction these days i don't
[2694.24 --> 2702.64]  even know i have no idea but uh someone's like on my way to buy a shirt okay you weren't paying
[2702.64 --> 2707.92]  attention i already said it's too late yeah although i'm not saying that we'll never do anything like
[2707.92 --> 2715.24]  this again i'm just saying that if you bought one and you got i'm not going to even say what the design
[2715.24 --> 2719.46]  of the shirt is you got to go look at your shirt because i'm willing to bet whoever got it because
[2719.46 --> 2724.36]  actually i know that whoever got it didn't notice that it's a different design because they would
[2724.36 --> 2729.44]  have contacted customer support already but it's very different looking once you actually like
[2729.44 --> 2737.08]  clue in you know oh that doesn't say ltt at all so go go check it go check it out guys uh all right
[2737.08 --> 2746.14]  let's talk about xbox series s and xbox series x shall we okay so finally the information is rolling in
[2746.14 --> 2752.92]  on the next generation consoles from microsoft and i'm not gonna lie man it's looking pretty
[2752.92 --> 2760.32]  compelling yeah it's looking pretty compelling we've got the xbox series x at 499 coming so pre-orders
[2760.32 --> 2767.30]  are going to start september 22nd so in 11 days and they are going to launch globally on november the 10th
[2767.30 --> 2775.26]  and then the s is coming in at just 299 so it will be diskless unlike sony's strategy of doing two
[2775.26 --> 2781.24]  full powered consoles one digital only and one with an optical drive microsoft has basically said
[2781.24 --> 2787.56]  well look if you don't care about an optical drive or if you want to save a buck then we're going to do
[2787.56 --> 2793.86]  like a totally cut down version but we're going to price it super aggro so even though it's only
[2793.86 --> 2801.30]  let's have a look here four teraflops versus 12.15 teraflops on the series x with less ram
[2801.30 --> 2808.72]  my understanding is that the ssd size is the same is it not hold on those uh specs are not actually
[2808.72 --> 2814.32]  in here and i'm a little bit hazy on it if you want to i'm sure i'm going to correct me um
[2814.32 --> 2825.06]  so even though it is less powerful 299 holy crap like you cannot we've tried you cannot build
[2825.06 --> 2834.02]  like a good quality gaming machine well you can but it's it's it's tough you're going to end up
[2834.02 --> 2838.44]  making compromises somewhere if you're trying to build a gaming machine remember it comes with a
[2838.44 --> 2845.60]  controller like a good quality controller you can't ignore value adds like that it is real tough like
[2845.60 --> 2851.52]  what's an xbox one controller worth like 40 bucks 50 60 bucks something like that gotta be around there
[2851.52 --> 2859.86]  like i'd guess 50 60 i can look it up 250 is not enough to build a gaming rig especially one that's
[2859.86 --> 2865.88]  going to have the capability to play all these upcoming games for a very long period of time now
[2865.88 --> 2872.92]  it's not going to run at 4k resolution obviously like the xbox series x is and in fact i've seen some
[2872.92 --> 2880.46]  rumblings that developers are a little bit unhappy about the xbox series s is low specs and yet this
[2880.46 --> 2887.62]  ambitious target of 1440p gaming because it means that kind of like pc game developers it's so funny
[2887.62 --> 2893.70]  consoles are getting so much closer to pcs just like pc game developers all of a sudden xbox developers
[2893.70 --> 2899.44]  have to target all these different not just resolutions but now levels of detail and they
[2899.44 --> 2903.78]  have to start playing around with draw distance from one machine to another and i mean it's it's already
[2903.78 --> 2909.12]  happened such that you can actually adjust graphical fidelity settings in game and go okay i want this fps
[2909.12 --> 2914.90]  uh where i know i'm going to be sacrificing some visual quality but i want a higher frame rate or you
[2914.90 --> 2919.72]  can run at a lower frame rate and have you know more eye candy on it's it's basically happening now the
[2919.72 --> 2926.38]  the consoles are the consoles are pcs but i still think the most compelling thing about the new xboxes is not
[2926.38 --> 2936.12]  just this crazy affordable price for a new generation console but the subscription service like this is
[2936.12 --> 2948.64]  to me if i'm sony absolutely terrifying so the series s is going to be 24.99 a month for 24 months
[2948.64 --> 2951.58]  and will include game pass
[2951.58 --> 2963.02]  that's nuts no i also can't hear you by the way no upfront cost whatsoever so game pass and the console
[2963.02 --> 2967.78]  by the way you actually own it so at the end of 24 months you own it you're effectively financing
[2967.78 --> 2972.74]  it not just renting it like you might from your cable company with your cable box so you own the
[2972.74 --> 2978.78]  console at the end you've got cloud streaming via project x cloud over 100 xbox games via game pass
[2978.78 --> 2985.22]  over 60 ea games via ea play so that's a five dollar a month value that's bundled in first party xbox
[2985.22 --> 2993.54]  titles on launch day and it applies to the xbox one xbox series x and s and pc so basically for
[2993.54 --> 2999.60]  yeah 10 bucks more than games pass alone you get a series s and for 20 bucks more you get a series x
[2999.60 --> 3004.72]  that's wild like we've been talking about games as a service for a long time i personally didn't
[3004.72 --> 3009.78]  expect they would just give you the device bundled in on that price i mean that's that's pretty wild
[3009.78 --> 3015.44]  that's the cable that's the cable tv model except that microsoft has the benefit of something people
[3015.44 --> 3021.30]  actually give about which is gaming instead of like shows full of commercials or whatever now you
[3021.30 --> 3025.40]  can have games full of commercials people are moving to like netflix and stuff anyways which you
[3025.40 --> 3030.32]  can do through the console so who cares um a couple random things that i looked up while you were
[3030.32 --> 3038.04]  talking yeah xbox controllers they start at 65 bucks you go and they scale up quite quickly um for even
[3038.04 --> 3045.38]  some of the more basic designs they start moving to 79 85 dollars etc all us in terms of storage the
[3045.38 --> 3054.64]  xbox series s uh has in the expandable storage is the same the type of ssd is the same yeah the speeds
[3054.64 --> 3061.86]  and feeds of the ssds are the same but the xbox series s uh its main storage ssd is 512 gigs and the x's
[3061.86 --> 3069.68]  is one terabyte right so thank you for thank you for the correction there so here's a crazy thing
[3069.68 --> 3078.60]  this is absolutely batshit crazy it actually costs if you knew you were going to buy game pass anyway
[3078.60 --> 3088.16]  um it actually costs 60 less to buy it by financing it through game pass than it does to buy it outright
[3088.16 --> 3095.70]  in the first place and then subscribe to game pass for two years how much of a mind blow is that
[3095.70 --> 3102.20]  microsoft is effectively i mean you can see it either way you can see it as they're effectively
[3102.20 --> 3106.48]  like giving away games or they're giving away consoles i mean they're not they're discounting
[3106.48 --> 3112.86]  realistically and it's brilliant because they're actually getting you on the hook for effectively
[3112.86 --> 3119.60]  what works out to about five triple a launch titles so five sixty dollar games right at launch
[3119.60 --> 3125.46]  which if you look at previous console attach rates are not necessarily that high i mean i don't know
[3125.46 --> 3130.32]  what it was like when you were a kid but like for my super nintendo i only owned aside from super mario
[3130.32 --> 3136.48]  world which came with my console i only owned three games i owned we used to rent a lot we used to rent a
[3136.48 --> 3141.82]  lot and so you you look at it and you go oh snap well this is they're basically taking
[3141.82 --> 3150.00]  that that purchase revenue that i spent on final fantasy 3 aka 6 sorry final fantasy 3 in north
[3150.00 --> 3156.46]  america pilot wings and super mario all-stars so there's my 180 dollars and then probably the other
[3156.46 --> 3161.02]  hundred couple hundred dollars that i spent on rentals and instead of it going to blockbuster
[3161.02 --> 3167.10]  microsoft just gets to take all of it so they're subsidizing the console way more effectively they could
[3167.10 --> 3171.80]  sell these things at an even deeper loss depending on what their licensing agreements are like
[3171.80 --> 3176.44]  but i mean they're also the publisher for a lot of these games so like yeah they hold all the
[3176.44 --> 3183.48]  cards they're they're vertically integrated i don't know man the playstation the playstation
[3183.48 --> 3189.80]  5 was looking pretty compelling but this looks pretty compelling too unless you already own a pc
[3189.80 --> 3193.64]  in which case you could just get game pass and then you don't need an xbox anyway
[3193.64 --> 3202.62]  and like the game pass as much as i resist those types of things i'm always the like physical copy
[3202.62 --> 3208.34]  guy but the xbox game pass is pretty solid yeah there's a lot of really compelling stuff in there
[3208.34 --> 3216.34]  really good stuff on it and like yeah like genuinely very compelling prices what was that stupid android
[3216.34 --> 3223.04]  console yeah this is no like oh yeah you know like oh it comes with games this is like real games that
[3223.04 --> 3230.84]  you were actually like gonna buy yeah yeah exactly yeah it's crazy i don't know this this list of like
[3230.84 --> 3236.42]  launch titles i don't think these are included necessarily gears tactics yeah yeah i mean that's
[3236.42 --> 3242.80]  a microsoft uh published game so yakuza like a dragon destiny to be on light i don't know but these are
[3242.80 --> 3247.86]  launch titles for the console anyway so destiny 2 assassin's creed valhalla are you gonna 100% valhalla
[3247.86 --> 3255.46]  or do you just not care anymore are you over it uh assassin's creed games are very the last two have
[3255.46 --> 3262.20]  actually been very good um and if i'm just i'm just so worried about assassin's creed games these days
[3262.20 --> 3268.42]  because who knows the whole time it's either been like just one of the worst games of the year
[3268.42 --> 3273.52]  or one of the best ones and there just seems to be no real way to know before it comes out
[3273.52 --> 3279.04]  so just i'll i'm not even i will i will not pre-order it i'm probably not gonna get it on day
[3279.04 --> 3285.30]  one to see what the like quick reviews are and then i'll decide all right so let's let's get with
[3285.30 --> 3291.54]  everything that we know now can we get a verdict luke next gen console if you have let's say you have
[3291.54 --> 3298.48]  like seven let's say you have six hundred dollars to spend so that's uh that's a series s uh with game
[3298.48 --> 3305.90]  pass um for for two years or that's a series x and you're just kind of on your own for games you're
[3305.90 --> 3310.64]  gonna have to save up for games uh we don't know how much playstation 5 costs but it'll probably be
[3310.64 --> 3315.06]  less than that and you'll be able to afford an exclusive or two what do you buy
[3315.06 --> 3325.96]  i think it's actually not that simple i think i can't properly answer that question because the
[3325.96 --> 3332.32]  subscription model of acquiring the console that way yep and it being 24 months that's a long
[3332.32 --> 3337.66]  commitment that is a long most relationships lost last less than 24 months you know let's get real
[3337.66 --> 3341.88]  here yeah especially i mean if you're in high school they might last less than a week less than 24 hours
[3341.88 --> 3350.50]  but like it's it's it might not be that simple like if if i'm remembering my like purchasing
[3350.50 --> 3355.72]  decisions that i made around games and kind of stuff when sure when i was a lot younger let's say high
[3355.72 --> 3360.02]  school time yeah like this series s at 25 bucks a month
[3360.02 --> 3369.34]  damn looks pretty good doesn't it i could get that together i could mow lawns i could yep do whatever
[3369.34 --> 3374.34]  i could get my 25 bucks i'd have to give it to like my mom whatever and then she would handle the
[3374.34 --> 3381.34]  credit card or whatever yep yeah but like i could do that i might even push knowing myself and go for
[3381.34 --> 3387.52]  the x at 35 knowing that i'm gonna have great games for two years the console is gonna run it just fine
[3387.52 --> 3393.16]  and maybe every once in a blue moon if i like push for some extra cash i might be able to buy a one-off
[3393.16 --> 3401.52]  title um but that's like i think the subscription approach is for a lot of people the just the
[3401.52 --> 3407.62]  digestibility of it is so fantastic don't forget about playstation now too though so playstation now
[3407.62 --> 3412.58]  does exist with a console yeah well that's the that's the difference what we don't know though
[3412.58 --> 3416.70]  is if sony is going to counter with some kind of playstation now bundle because whether they had
[3416.70 --> 3422.96]  intended to or not now it's kind of looking like they might not have a choice so i had to when i was
[3422.96 --> 3435.48]  growing up i got an xbox 360 um and i had to get the core is there any details on this man i can't
[3435.48 --> 3443.16]  remember i think it had less less hard drive or this thing sucked and it was so annoying because
[3443.16 --> 3451.10]  you like needed so much more stuff to like make it actually right good right um and and i got that
[3451.10 --> 3458.16]  because that's kind of like what i could afford at the time really wanted to get an xbox um i think
[3458.16 --> 3463.36]  i might this is so long ago my details are super fuzzy i'm sure my brother was with me in on this
[3463.36 --> 3470.14]  i'm sure my dad probably is like the only reason why we got it in the end etc um but like there was
[3470.14 --> 3477.92]  something going on i don't even yeah okay can i pitch this so sony's sony's still gonna have the
[3477.92 --> 3484.88]  exclusives like that's a very hard drive that that's right it had no hard drive so okay hold on a second
[3484.88 --> 3493.54]  so sony has their exclusives microsoft has this like unbelievable value but can i actually just
[3493.54 --> 3499.94]  hit you with something totally crazy i think what could what could tip me to microsoft here if i was
[3499.94 --> 3506.04]  if i was shopping for a console notice that i didn't give you the option of an rtx 30 70 or whatever in
[3506.04 --> 3512.86]  there that that we're not we're not acknowledging that right now um what could tip me to microsoft
[3512.86 --> 3518.94]  is look how consumer friendly they're being this time around they've already partnered up with seagate
[3518.94 --> 3525.60]  for an external like uh for an expansion one terabyte ssd that'll cost a couple hundred bucks
[3525.60 --> 3531.26]  that's a lot of money but it's not like totally unreasonable uh you know like we used to experience
[3531.26 --> 3537.28]  with you know memory cards for you know playstation one playstation two that kind of thing um and
[3537.28 --> 3547.90]  controller compatibility microsoft has absolutely taken a just gargantuan step forward in consumer
[3547.90 --> 3555.68]  friendliness with their controller compatibility carrying forward now it's funny because as the
[3555.68 --> 3561.24]  words left my mouth i realized that there is actually one other company that did carry forward
[3561.24 --> 3568.38]  controller compatibility and it was nintendo of all people with the uh wii so early wii's you could
[3568.38 --> 3572.60]  actually use gamecube controllers and i guess nintendo wasn't concerned because they knew they
[3572.60 --> 3577.22]  didn't have a ton of killer apps and they wanted like gamecube backwards compatibility to be like a
[3577.22 --> 3581.56]  selling point of the console i don't know what was going i mean i i can i can hardly ever figure out
[3581.56 --> 3586.28]  like really cool wii games were were motion-based and it wasn't going to work for that anyway yeah so it
[3586.28 --> 3593.16]  wasn't it wasn't going to cannibalize sales of of accessories for the console but microsoft seems to
[3593.16 --> 3598.78]  have basically said okay look we're not going to gouge you on the accessories if you already own you
[3598.78 --> 3607.20]  know 500 600 dollars worth of xbox elite controllers go ahead keep using them meanwhile sony's like oh no we
[3607.20 --> 3613.34]  have we have we have very we have very special features you simply cannot enjoy the games
[3613.34 --> 3621.12]  with the uh with the old controller i don't know what accent that is russian to german don't worry
[3621.12 --> 3627.40]  about it it doesn't matter as long as it's not japanese i can't get in trouble so i i feel like this
[3627.40 --> 3634.80]  is them just being like we really don't want to lose this time because i think i think you could
[3634.80 --> 3640.58]  probably say they lost the last generation you probably you can probably say that you could
[3640.58 --> 3645.76]  probably say that i i feel like they're trying to come out swinging this time 100 they got they got
[3645.76 --> 3651.42]  murdered they did on their release last time that's more like it you could probably say they lost
[3651.42 --> 3658.82]  but i don't even just mean in the end like with their announcements they got murdered oh yeah
[3658.82 --> 3663.98]  someone who's just clowning on them they not only they not only didn't sell as many consoles they
[3663.98 --> 3669.28]  looked like they had no idea what gamers wanted they looked they looked clueless they looked out
[3669.28 --> 3675.12]  of touch sony made sure that they looked that way 100 which is exactly what they're supposed to do i'm
[3675.12 --> 3682.38]  not like it's whatever but this time it's fair and love more this seems very aggressive and very
[3682.38 --> 3687.64]  calculated yeah 100 i mean they're leveraging the strengths they have which is azure and the cloud
[3687.64 --> 3696.52]  and yeah this this gaming over in the network and content delivery over the network and uh just the
[3696.52 --> 3701.70]  fact that they are just gently like what what what are they like seven times the market cap like they're
[3701.70 --> 3710.22]  people i think forget sometimes that microsoft versus sony is not all that dissimilar to like intel
[3710.22 --> 3716.78]  versus amd at some points in their history like even when amd is doing well like intel is a much much
[3716.78 --> 3725.62]  larger company and in the same way microsoft is an enormous company compared to sony yeah um what is what
[3725.62 --> 3739.98]  is nick sending me here uh i have no idea what he's sending me oh okay i'm sorry nick's just messaging me
[3739.98 --> 3748.94]  in the middle of the thing uh this is from cloud nine um tag someone who warms up like this and for
[3748.94 --> 3757.02]  whatever reason we've got a picture in picture of me like spazzing out this is actually very very very
[3757.02 --> 3763.36]  tastefully slapped together here because they've actually got a picture in picture of what we're
[3763.36 --> 3768.52]  looking at in the big screen on my monitor there as though it's captured that is not what happened
[3768.52 --> 3778.26]  that never happened um you look so pro i think what i was trying to do was make it not track
[3778.26 --> 3782.46]  properly i can't even remember this is a long time ago that's outdated merch you guys are looking at
[3782.46 --> 3787.70]  there don't look too closely at it we don't sell that anymore i'm pretty sure oh that's hilarious
[3787.70 --> 3794.64]  all right so anyway i think you i think that's when there was the popular mouse test of trying to
[3794.64 --> 3799.84]  move it too fast on a mouse pad i think it was logitech use that mechanical arm to do it
[3799.84 --> 3804.34]  okay i think we were being like is this even possible like yeah could anyone ever move their
[3804.34 --> 3811.20]  arm that fast i think that's what we were doing so i i really like microsoft's move with the
[3811.20 --> 3817.94]  controllers that's actually a total game changer for me because it's like an unspoken cost like nobody
[3817.94 --> 3825.88]  talks about that a nintendo switch costs like 700 by the time you buy a console and enough controllers
[3825.88 --> 3834.14]  to play smash with all your friends like that's ridiculous and yet we just we accept it we don't
[3834.14 --> 3840.74]  even really talk about it so every new console is like it's not just the 300 to 500 or 600 however
[3840.74 --> 3846.16]  much they charge for it it's not just that it's like that plus another what you're saying xbox controllers
[3846.16 --> 3855.00]  start at 65 bucks so plus another like 250 of controllers to replace perfectly good controllers
[3855.00 --> 3859.78]  that there is nothing wrong with and the stupidest thing about it is for years now there's been no
[3859.78 --> 3868.86]  reason for it as soon as we switched to usb and bluetooth there was no reason for controllers to not
[3868.86 --> 3873.58]  be intercompatible from generation to generation and you can leave it up to game developers to say okay
[3873.58 --> 3879.40]  no you're really going to need like a ps5 controller to play this game but realistically i would be
[3879.40 --> 3886.38]  floored if there's many multiplayer like local multiplayer titles for the ps5 that actually require
[3886.38 --> 3892.80]  a ps5 controller and if we're talking mostly single player games then i would say there's nothing wrong
[3892.80 --> 3898.22]  with just using the ps5 controller that probably comes bundled with your console and some last generation
[3898.22 --> 3902.28]  controllers for all your friends who just want to sit and play i don't even know what multiplayer
[3902.28 --> 3907.10]  what local multiplayer games are like big playstation exclusive titles right now
[3907.10 --> 3913.28]  um they're definitely more on the single player side of things
[3913.28 --> 3918.28]  so there you go like why do i why do i need to
[3918.28 --> 3924.60]  yeah i'm sure chat's gonna i'm sure chat's gonna jump in with some education for my
[3924.60 --> 3928.06]  so who's like rocket league dot dot dot question mark
[3928.06 --> 3933.58]  i mean you don't need new playstation 5 controller features for that
[3933.58 --> 3938.14]  yeah not so much uh someone said racing games
[3938.14 --> 3943.88]  little big planet little big planet oof mortal combat
[3943.88 --> 3948.06]  again like there's bro force like there's no way you're gonna need
[3948.06 --> 3953.20]  well what even are the stupid features just like better haptic feedback or something ps5
[3953.20 --> 3957.28]  controller features like what what is what is the killer app here exactly
[3957.28 --> 3965.04]  a redesigned light bar two-tone color scheme hold on the gamer.com lists every exclusive feature
[3965.04 --> 3971.98]  the new name dual sense come on you're not even trying you're not even trying to make me
[3971.98 --> 3975.40]  care about this haptic feedback in the triggers i could live without that
[3975.40 --> 3978.84]  the share button is gone it's now called create
[3978.84 --> 3985.32]  built-in microphone okay we're talking again local multiplayer that is a that is an online multiplayer
[3985.32 --> 3993.08]  only feature two-tone color scheme redesigned light bar usbc charging no there has to be something else
[3993.08 --> 3998.48]  isn't there something else i thought like the the the triggers are also like more more granular
[3998.48 --> 4002.14]  or something to go along with the haptic feedback i don't i don't know the point is
[4002.14 --> 4008.16]  i think it's i think it's anti-consumer and for that reason assuming that there wasn't some exclusive
[4008.16 --> 4014.18]  i absolutely had to play i would rather support microsoft just for giving two shits about not just their
[4014.18 --> 4018.42]  consumers but also the environment why do we keep making plastic controllers when we've all had
[4018.42 --> 4028.42]  perfectly good controllers for 10 years there that's my piece on it yeah um so we don't we don't
[4028.42 --> 4034.24]  know the price yet of the playstation 5 but if you had to call it are you going like for this
[4034.24 --> 4040.02]  generation if you had to call it now would you go xbox it's hard to say i think there's a short-term
[4040.02 --> 4044.26]  winner and i think there's a long-term winner i think in the short term sony wins because i think
[4044.26 --> 4047.68]  their consoles are going to end up more expensive which i think is going to be good for their revenue
[4047.68 --> 4054.42]  right now and i think that more people are going to be attracted to the playstation 5 because
[4054.42 --> 4062.58]  its launched title lineup looks a lot better like what is what does the series x and the series s for
[4062.58 --> 4070.74]  that what do they have like nothing and if i was going to spend 300 500 or 300 dollars on an xbox
[4070.74 --> 4075.12]  there's a compelling argument to be made for me just spending that money on a graphics card and
[4075.12 --> 4082.80]  playing on windows with game pass so that's tough like if i if i wanted to cover all my bases
[4082.80 --> 4088.20]  i don't go and buy an x because there's certain things you're going to enjoy on pc and not on xbox
[4088.20 --> 4093.58]  but i'm not going to go buy an xbox and a pc i'm going to go buy a playstation and a pc
[4093.58 --> 4098.32]  well like if i can only if it's like you've got three options pick two
[4098.32 --> 4105.36]  yeah but playstation has officially pushed forward like they they put horizon zero dawn on pc that's
[4105.36 --> 4112.28]  true the exclusive work pretty well and they said publicly that they are like i don't remember the
[4112.28 --> 4116.88]  exact wording so i'm i'm shooting out of nowhere from here but i think there's something along the
[4116.88 --> 4121.56]  lines of they're excited to do that more in the future yes that's that is true but right now so
[4121.56 --> 4126.94]  that's that's why i said there's a short-term winner and a long-term winner so i think sony is
[4126.94 --> 4131.32]  the short-term winner because there's more compelling reasons to buy a playstation than an xbox
[4131.32 --> 4136.20]  series what are we going to call them now this is so annoying xbox series
[4136.20 --> 4142.52]  yeah like oh why do they do this to us anyway so there's more compelling reasons for playstation
[4142.52 --> 4150.40]  right now but i think in the longer term man game pass cross-platform um like licensing the game for
[4150.40 --> 4156.08]  both pc and xbox so i could like buy a game on my xbox series s and then like five years later right
[4156.08 --> 4162.84]  i still own that game and i can just i you know i got a job now i got like a ball in gaming rig i can
[4162.84 --> 4169.98]  like play that game at 16k resolution or whatever on my on my computer that's sick that's awesome that's
[4169.98 --> 4174.84]  an experience that sony just doesn't seem to have taken seriously here that backwards and forwards
[4174.84 --> 4180.16]  compatibility which is ironic because it was sony that pioneered it in the first place with the
[4180.16 --> 4187.18]  playstation 2 and i mean the last generation playstation laughed at microsoft for like
[4187.18 --> 4194.56]  consumer unfriendly compatibility and now microsoft is going very consumer friendly compatibility
[4194.56 --> 4200.64]  and playstation's stagnating a little bit at least so far maybe they'll change some stuff we'll see
[4200.64 --> 4204.84]  maybe they can change things around they certainly have the capability because everything's using
[4204.84 --> 4209.98]  standard communication protocols that's the kind of the worst part about sony's lack of backwards
[4209.98 --> 4215.20]  controller compatibility because they could do it they could turn it on at any time it's just a
[4215.20 --> 4222.70]  computer i i think i think the xbox is going to be more
[4222.70 --> 4235.64]  i think this subscription model of getting the console is going to be very important oh yeah i think the the
[4235.64 --> 4240.26]  the the current generation of people rising up are being very um
[4240.26 --> 4246.86]  um desensitized to subscription models yeah i was gonna say conditioned but that's a good word too
[4246.86 --> 4257.70]  i think they both work um i and i i think this is very digestible 25 bucks in rough economy low job
[4257.70 --> 4264.36]  forces blah blah blah blah blah yeah um the the world's on fire there's a pandemic going on like it's it's a
[4264.36 --> 4272.38]  little bit rough out there it's a lot easier to digest 25 bucks 25 bucks no up front get all your
[4272.38 --> 4278.16]  games you can use your old controllers you can maybe uh craigslist some other guys old controllers
[4278.16 --> 4284.20]  they're still gonna work yeah exactly there's a lot of it it's the scrapyard wars console
[4284.20 --> 4289.84]  basically if i was and like if you're in that situation where you're like a kid trying to
[4289.84 --> 4294.22]  convince your parents yep this is probably the one you're gonna try to go for
[4294.22 --> 4297.58]  so like i think shad nobody's talking about stadia
[4297.58 --> 4304.16]  no no one cares this is super chat no one's talking about stadia right now
[4304.16 --> 4311.36]  um i yeah i think that's super compelling so and i think that's going to get them actually a pretty
[4311.36 --> 4316.00]  surprising amount of market share because like yeah the the the buyer that you're talking about
[4316.00 --> 4324.38]  sounds like um at least a relatively solid amount of income probably in a an adult at this point um
[4324.38 --> 4332.82]  potentially a double income no kids situation or married yet or something like that like like stable
[4332.82 --> 4340.32]  good income all that kind of stuff i think kids may be less stable maybe not as dedicated to to games
[4340.32 --> 4345.12]  and it's it's a little bit more digestible to do 25 bucks a month you get this console you get games
[4345.12 --> 4352.36]  for 24 months whatever i it's just it's so it's so easy yeah and what's cool about it is compared to
[4352.36 --> 4358.22]  something like stadia at least it's a local it's it's a subscription model again and you can stream games
[4358.22 --> 4365.18]  to it right with project x cloud but you can also play them locally with no latency and when your internet's out
[4365.18 --> 4374.04]  ball sort of always on drm um okay hold on a second though navic to help them too yeah oh uh navic shah
[4374.04 --> 4380.36]  says dualshock 4 works on playstation 5 right that's fair enough but it's even more offensive the way that
[4380.36 --> 4387.70]  it works it only works with backward compatible ps4 games so the controller absolutely works it's a
[4387.70 --> 4394.18]  software switch that they can flip they just choose not to i didn't even know that it's even more
[4394.18 --> 4399.48]  offensive that doesn't make it better uh and something to add we've been talking about how
[4399.48 --> 4407.18]  xbox game pass is is legit um this is xbox game pass ultimate meaning it also comes with ea play
[4407.18 --> 4416.86]  yep that's actually a pretty big deal yep 60 games 60 more games baby whatever you think about ea that's
[4416.86 --> 4424.16]  like actually it's a lot of games i'll make the rules here all right we should move on uh i think
[4424.16 --> 4431.12]  we've got uh some rumors to talk about with respect to zen 3 and rdna 2 um there's really not much that
[4431.12 --> 4437.00]  we can say other than that amd will be announcing uh rdna 2 and zen 3 on october 8th i thought there
[4437.00 --> 4442.16]  was another date for one of them uh don't quote me on that so sometime in october uh zen 3 will be
[4442.16 --> 4447.34]  next gen ryzen 3000 series desktop processors it'll be seven nanometer plus or so to speak
[4447.34 --> 4452.82]  uh up to 64 cores for the data center chips um we don't know how many cores there will be for desktop
[4452.82 --> 4459.32]  but amd has stated publicly that they don't see a saturation point for cores so we could see more than
[4459.32 --> 4465.08]  16 for all we know i doubt it i'll be floored if they do more than 16 uh first chips will be coming
[4465.08 --> 4469.90]  late 2020 uh looks like amd is getting into a nice little tick-tock cycle here which is sweet
[4469.90 --> 4478.38]  and also we're going to have some news uh regarding rdna 2 aka big navi so rtx 3070 has
[4478.38 --> 4488.14]  5888 cuda cores um and big navi is going to have 5120 shaders so what it looks like with amd touting
[4488.14 --> 4494.58]  50 performance per watt compared to rdna 1 and ray tracing support is another round of
[4494.58 --> 4503.90]  amd is just plain not competitive in the graphic space in spite of their best efforts uh i i'd love
[4503.90 --> 4511.50]  to be wrong i i 100 sign up for being wrong on this i i'm stoked to be wrong on this but it's i don't i
[4511.50 --> 4517.66]  don't think it's gonna happen i mean rdna 1 looked great on paper even and yet for the first couple
[4517.66 --> 4524.64]  months of its life it had horrible driver problems and a lot of these are a what i would consider
[4524.64 --> 4532.32]  relatively weak generation of competition gpus yeah i mean even when nvidia has a bad gpu like a
[4532.32 --> 4538.74]  gtx 480 or i mean rtx 2000 it was only bad because nvidia's previous generation was so good like it's not
[4538.74 --> 4545.22]  like amd had anything to compete with it even when nvidia sucks their driver situation has been better
[4545.22 --> 4555.70]  than amds for what a decade like and they like know it and they own that super hard oh yeah they're
[4555.70 --> 4563.98]  super ready with uh game ready drivers yep like they take it real serious yeah so not letting that go
[4563.98 --> 4571.60]  yeah we're we're hoping for the best here but um yeah you know not not getting my not getting not
[4571.60 --> 4581.16]  getting too excited here um we can we can go real briefly over wd labeling 7200 rpm drives as 5400 rpm
[4581.16 --> 4588.04]  class now can i just throw this at you for a second here if you ordered a 5400 rpm hard drive for your
[4588.04 --> 4593.40]  laptop or your external drive enclosure or whatever would you see yourself as being potentially pretty
[4593.40 --> 4601.14]  stoked when you get a 7200 rpm drive uh i guess yeah okay well redditors
[4601.14 --> 4608.24]  of r slash data hoarder are upset with western digital again this time for misrepresenting the
[4608.24 --> 4616.28]  rotational speed of their wd red nas hard drives uh wait what the uh is this a blah blah in the past
[4616.28 --> 4621.80]  they have not disclosed close the 55 the drive zone firmware yeah okay so what happened was for each of
[4621.80 --> 4629.38]  several drive models uh redditor amaroco placed a sample of that drive on an empty cardboard box with a mic
[4629.38 --> 4634.94]  held directly above it this is great spectral analysis of the recorded audio using adobe edition
[4634.94 --> 4643.08]  showed a baseline frequency of 120 hertz for two models of wd's eight terabyte 5400 rpm class drives
[4643.08 --> 4651.38]  that multiplied by 60 seconds per minute comes to 7200 cycles per minute so these 5400 rpm class drives
[4651.38 --> 4660.20]  really were spinning at 7200 rpm now faster spindles do mean lower seek latency and that's good for
[4660.20 --> 4666.72]  performance but in the context of a nas where you might actually be more interested in low noise
[4666.72 --> 4673.70]  and laptop i did i'm sorry uh low noise and low power consumption it can be a disadvantage
[4673.70 --> 4682.20]  because it'll actually produce more heat and make more noise so nas is a bit of a different situation
[4682.20 --> 4689.98]  yeah that's true sorry um so unfortunately the eight terabyte red that was confirmed to be 7200 rpm
[4689.98 --> 4697.90]  consumes 8.8 watts compared to seagate's barracuda 5.3 while active and 800 milliwatts compared to 250
[4697.90 --> 4704.52]  milliwatts in standby oops when they're spinning at the same rpms western digital and seagate's drives
[4704.52 --> 4709.84]  consume roughly the same power like the thing to remember is when you're spinning it's not like it's
[4709.84 --> 4716.62]  this linear uh difference in power consumption as you increase the spindle speed going from 5400 to
[4716.62 --> 4723.26]  7200 rpm is not just a you know whatever that works out to 40 increase in in power consumption in order
[4723.26 --> 4727.54]  to keep it going that fast i mean even when the drives are full of helium like the the air resistance
[4727.54 --> 4733.04]  inside these drives is a significant problem um that's one of the reasons that 10 000 rpm drives
[4733.04 --> 4738.00]  never took off for consumers they were just so much harder to engineer compared to 7200 rpm even
[4738.00 --> 4743.12]  though it only sounds like again like 40 more rotational speed um
[4743.12 --> 4754.32]  so w western digital's response here was 5400 rpm class does not actually mean the drive spins at 5400 rpm
[4754.32 --> 4760.10]  instead they have published rpm speed within a class or performance class for years rather than
[4760.10 --> 4765.24]  publishing specific spindle speeds uh they also said they fine-tuned select hard drive platforms and
[4765.24 --> 4768.90]  the related characteristics to create several different variations of such platforms to meet
[4768.90 --> 4774.88]  different market or application needs blah blah blah etc etc etc so i think there might be a little bit of
[4774.88 --> 4778.92]  i think there might be a little bit of confusion in our notes here because i really thought these were
[4778.92 --> 4790.38]  two and a half inch drives um but i don't see any reference to that in the arse article which um
[4790.38 --> 4798.52]  well the arse article on the on the picture it says wd 10 spzx wd blue one terabyte 2.5 inch
[4798.52 --> 4805.06]  okay so i think what people were mostly upset about was these 2.5 inch drives in their laptops
[4805.06 --> 4811.12]  affecting battery life um don't don't quote me on that the point is whatever kinds of drives they
[4811.12 --> 4816.22]  were there can be disadvantages to increasing the spindle speed and redditors are mad there you go
[4816.22 --> 4822.76]  that's the summary oh man there's actually like more pretty interesting news here do you want to do
[4822.76 --> 4830.08]  the uh do you want to do the bounty now we got a bounty ladies and gentlemen okay all right this is a
[4830.08 --> 4837.20]  thing that exists and i know that there are people out there who have them because they've been
[4837.20 --> 4845.08]  considered collector's items for quite some time this is the hot wheels pc it was an entire set
[4845.08 --> 4852.20]  tower monitor uh speakers keyboard mouse mouse pad i believe there was a racing wheel yep there's a
[4852.20 --> 4860.04]  racing wheel i will pay i i want to do a video i've actually wanted to do a video video about it for a
[4860.04 --> 4866.22]  long time there's also a barbie pc and i'll accept either i think the barbie pc was probably
[4866.22 --> 4871.94]  significantly less popular there's a lot fewer pictures of it uh lgr did manage to get his hands
[4871.94 --> 4877.40]  on one so there's one right there i will offer what's a what's a fair offer for this luke what do
[4877.40 --> 4881.98]  you think what kind of bounty should i put out i don't want to offer too much again because i think
[4881.98 --> 4887.44]  i ended up overpaying for that monitor i think you've overpaid for everything so far um
[4887.44 --> 4895.52]  i don't know we tried to acquire one and and kind of couldn't um
[4895.52 --> 4906.52]  okay i don't know i yeah all right all right let's say let's say
[4906.52 --> 4914.44]  oh what's the what's the chat what's the chat type one type one people are like
[4914.44 --> 4923.52]  a grand two grand i don't think grand makes any sense if you have i think a grand no no
[4923.52 --> 4930.88]  you see like you're you're you're if you have a full set full set i will give you
[4930.88 --> 4940.60]  sub speaker things yes i will give you five grand for a full set 5k i still think you know what you
[4940.60 --> 4949.12]  know what luke the the uh the monitor video went it popped that video popped uh i think i actually
[4949.12 --> 4955.14]  made my money back on it so you know what every once in a while i don't i don't feel like yvonne
[4955.14 --> 4961.96]  would be stoked on that overall statement she's not yvonne is not i might have made my money back cfos
[4961.96 --> 4968.04]  are not that into i think i made my money back but that's okay sometimes sometimes we gotta just
[4968.04 --> 4975.42]  take one for the team here and uh five grand if you can get me a full barbie pc or hot wheels pc
[4975.42 --> 4981.00]  we ain't real hard to get in touch with so just contact the business email it's not hidden uh and
[4981.00 --> 4986.34]  that's my offer that's that's my offer right there um all right there's one more thing i wanted to talk
[4986.34 --> 4991.28]  about here apple is finally allowing game streaming on ios and it's in the most apple way possible
[4991.28 --> 5001.34]  they will allow stadia project x cloud and geforce now on ios but only as catalog apps to show what's
[5001.34 --> 5010.16]  available to actually nice to actually play games users will have to download that game's specific
[5010.16 --> 5018.00]  app so every game in these streaming libraries must be submitted as an individual app with a product page
[5018.00 --> 5028.80]  user ratings etc oh what i know right what like why do you have to download a separate app to just
[5028.80 --> 5037.52]  stream a game oh i hope the apps can talk to each other decently well i don't even know the whole app
[5037.52 --> 5041.88]  has like everything you actually need to download and the individual download for each game is just like
[5041.88 --> 5049.58]  nothing i've never actually i've never actually used like a catalog app so i can't say that i have a
[5049.58 --> 5055.36]  ton of experience with it i can just i can say that that is so much actually i've never actually
[5055.36 --> 5064.48]  used that is so much kludgier than it absolutely has to be so much kludgier yeah oh yeah and in epic
[5064.48 --> 5071.68]  versus apple news uh sign in with apple uh was uh apple attempted to remove that from epic games
[5071.68 --> 5077.12]  accounts yeah that's you know what's so funny is apple like pitched their sign in with apple as like
[5077.12 --> 5082.36]  a trusted thing it's like well then why are you running around like removing it from services people
[5082.36 --> 5090.08]  use because you're butthurt over a court battle with anyway the the removal was delayed um so so that
[5090.08 --> 5095.32]  that happened somebody stepped in and was like whoa whoa whoa this is this is not like why are we
[5095.32 --> 5107.22]  punishing users why what are you doing like that's apple's arrogance on full display they're so arrogant
[5107.22 --> 5114.76]  like it's companies like apple and actually i i think i was planning a rant about this in one of my
[5114.76 --> 5122.58]  one of my videos that i never ended up actually doing but um companies that don't understand that
[5122.58 --> 5128.92]  a customer who didn't buy your product right or the way you want them to is still your customer like
[5128.92 --> 5138.32]  if if i'm not if i'm not using airpods with an iphone i still spent 250 us dollars i'm still your
[5138.32 --> 5144.10]  customer the fact that there is absolutely no way to update the firmware on airpods
[5144.10 --> 5151.18]  without an iphone is ridiculous that is so anti-consumer and the fact that apple apologists
[5151.18 --> 5161.52]  keep well apologizing for this behavior for apple just blows my mind it blows my mind if anybody else
[5161.52 --> 5167.70]  did that it would be completely unacceptable imagine if to if to get an ota update on your model y
[5167.70 --> 5177.72]  you had to own a model x imagine that world it's absurd like i i i can't even fathom it who else could
[5177.72 --> 5184.46]  get away with this every time we talk about this kind of stuff uh i wish you had watched pirates of
[5184.46 --> 5187.84]  silicon valley and the last time i mentioned on the wan show i ended up getting a bunch of tweets of
[5187.84 --> 5192.84]  people saying that they they watched it and thought i had one person that specifically said that it was
[5192.84 --> 5198.58]  they they've watched like all the the steve jobs movies there there are except for that one and
[5198.58 --> 5202.70]  they said once watching it they thought that was the best one that they had seen so maybe you should
[5202.70 --> 5209.04]  watch it all right all right all right all right all right it feels like this type of stuff feels so
[5209.04 --> 5215.34]  antithetical to like the idea of that company in that show you know what i mean
[5215.34 --> 5226.14]  like the the way that apple is being ran these days yep is so um it feels scared
[5226.14 --> 5232.50]  does that make sense i don't know scared is the right word because it's like how can you be scared
[5232.50 --> 5239.64]  and arrogant like how can you have so much disdain for your customers can come from fear how can you
[5239.64 --> 5244.92]  have so much disdain that you would tell a paying customer that they didn't spend enough to use their
[5244.92 --> 5252.52]  product because they they're worried that you're going to leave oh they need you to buy more stuff
[5252.52 --> 5258.20]  i think a lot of that i think a lot of that arrogance comes from fear their their whole company to me
[5258.20 --> 5266.42]  has felt very scared for a long time interesting okay all right okay all right like like the behind
[5266.42 --> 5274.02]  the the the company that you see in parts of silicon valley they're they're flying genuine pirate flags
[5274.02 --> 5280.20]  they're having weird crazy they have a party on the beach where steve jobs like intentionally pits two
[5280.20 --> 5286.82]  sides of his company against each other and not like in like fun beach games like he's trying to
[5286.82 --> 5292.34]  effectively make them hate each other to build like competition within the company to drive people to
[5292.34 --> 5297.76]  want to make their individual product better right so that you can like push people forward even more
[5297.76 --> 5303.14]  aggressively like they're they're kind of a little nuts and they're really aggressive and they push
[5303.14 --> 5312.90]  forward like really really hard and like but they're definitely not scared right and it it yeah it feels
[5312.90 --> 5317.54]  these days that they're that they're scared someone's saying that's wrong in chat i mean sure but like
[5317.54 --> 5325.46]  it feels like that to me cult mentality absolutely all right speaking of speaking of cults you you
[5325.46 --> 5331.42]  crazy cultists who tune in and give us your time so generously every week you no longer have to give
[5331.42 --> 5337.64]  us any more this week you can wait until next week to give it to us again thank you for tuning in we'll
[5337.64 --> 5343.76]  see you again next week that's it for our show today oh i lied we have to uh we have to um acknowledge
[5343.76 --> 5349.98]  the the the most extreme of the cultists the super chat senders uh floatplane android tv app when
[5349.98 --> 5357.30]  probably not anytime super soon yeah no no current in the works plans for that thomas requests a
[5357.30 --> 5365.12]  collared version of the elemental shirt so i can rep ltt at work a collared shirt um okay i mean hit nick
[5365.12 --> 5370.44]  up on twitter and i'm i don't know maybe it seems like it's like a weird request but uh
[5370.44 --> 5376.44]  hey trevor says it's my birthday and i just had a halo land party you're doing it right you know whose
[5376.44 --> 5385.64]  birthday it is my dad's wow yeah happy happy birthday pops left friend yeah yeah it's a good
[5385.64 --> 5393.20]  dude really really easy birthday to remember yeah because there was that whole uh like military coup
[5393.20 --> 5405.18]  yeah yeah in chile um but no i'm not i'm not even joking i didn't know that yeah yeah it's like
[5405.18 --> 5412.70]  going with the towers yeah it's the whole like thing uh all right so uh evan says as a technology
[5412.70 --> 5416.44]  what's your opinion of pam for signaling and now that's in the new 30 series do you think we'll see
[5416.44 --> 5422.92]  a lot more of it so basically what that is is sending multiple um bits of data per signal instead
[5422.92 --> 5429.88]  of just whatever it is one or two so four instead of two um so instead of just on the rise and fall
[5429.88 --> 5436.02]  we've got these like multiple states so it's basically kind of like tlc versus um and like
[5436.02 --> 5443.88]  mlc flash versus like slc flash so having these multiple states um it it effectively increases data
[5443.88 --> 5448.38]  transmission rates at the cost of making the controllers more complex uh seems like it was a
[5448.38 --> 5454.58]  matter of time and i'm super stoked for more bandwidth on you know consumer hardware i mean i don't know what
[5454.58 --> 5463.34]  else there's to really say about it um paul says i was browsing some old wang shows and saw some guy
[5463.34 --> 5471.44]  named slick hosting with linus pretty strange times the weird guy weird dude uh robert mail asks can you
[5471.44 --> 5474.90]  let us know what publishers picked up the children's book i would like to buy it this holiday season for
[5474.90 --> 5478.84]  my toddler well it'll definitely be on ltdstore.com we don't need a publisher we are self-publishing
[5478.84 --> 5483.20]  uh we're like we're printing this thing that's it's happening it's happening we've already got like the
[5483.20 --> 5488.68]  the copy that i held up in the video where i showed it off that is basically final uh there's it's down
[5488.68 --> 5494.34]  to two suppliers now and that was probably the one we're going to go with that was a finished book
[5494.34 --> 5501.14]  we are publishing it um as for where you can buy it ltdstore.com and maybe best buy canada i don't
[5501.14 --> 5505.66]  know we'll see we'll see we'll see how we're i don't know man i don't know it's i i know there's
[5505.66 --> 5510.14]  i know that our people are talking to their people i don't know if anything's going to come of it but
[5510.14 --> 5517.46]  i think it makes total sense as like a checkout aisle item at like an electronics store i think
[5517.46 --> 5522.52]  it makes total sense i think i think costco should pick it up put it right next to the next gen
[5522.52 --> 5527.74]  consoles for the younger gamers i think uh i think they're called indigo now but i was gonna say i
[5527.74 --> 5533.80]  think chapters should pick it up totally totally um ryan morash says the new mario kart game was
[5533.80 --> 5537.38]  made in partnership with a game studio local me i know a few people who worked on it that's pretty cool
[5537.38 --> 5543.98]  it looks really cool it could be bad nintendo generally polishes things pretty well these
[5543.98 --> 5551.58]  days though so uh jackson says any chance of a 15 a month option on floatplane right now i have to
[5551.58 --> 5557.62]  have two accounts any updates on desk pcv2 it's coming colin had a lot of trouble with the reservoir
[5557.62 --> 5562.84]  he's been working on the other stuff ps you got me into pc building at 10 thanks for the great content
[5562.84 --> 5567.74]  hey thanks jackson i mean we could put higher tiers just for lols but i don't really know what
[5567.74 --> 5572.94]  else we have to offer because as you're going to find out in how does lmg make money v2 which is
[5572.94 --> 5579.72]  coming very soon uh i'm going to be opening up the kimono here showing you guys exactly how the
[5579.72 --> 5582.76]  sausage is made so to speak um
[5582.76 --> 5593.02]  um you'll you'll see floatplane is a significant contributor for us as it is but one of the biggest
[5593.02 --> 5598.38]  reasons that it's so beneficial for us is that the money that floatplane contributors give us
[5598.38 --> 5604.30]  pretty much just goes to running the organization we it doesn't add a lot of additional overhead for
[5604.30 --> 5608.80]  us like something like a patreon would if we were constantly like you know putting hats in boxes to
[5608.80 --> 5615.08]  ship to people or like doing posters and stuff um so we don't want to create more tiers where we
[5615.08 --> 5621.58]  can't provide more value and we don't want to become float planers no offense luke we we want to focus
[5621.58 --> 5626.92]  i agree though that's like we're we're doing a bit of a recruitment drive right now and one of the
[5626.92 --> 5631.62]  things that i've been talking to creators about that i've been trying to pull onto the platform is that
[5631.62 --> 5636.92]  you don't necessarily want to become a float planer and that's that's kind of the whole point yeah
[5636.92 --> 5644.68]  uh so yeah that's that's not a problem at all um all right with the okay
[5644.68 --> 5655.84]  uh okay alexandra says my first video of yours i watched was a case unboxing 10 years ago
[5655.84 --> 5661.26]  no idea why i kept watching yeah those videos weren't very good any recommendations for 3440 by
[5661.26 --> 5667.20]  1440 under a thousand dollars canadian i mean you can't go wrong with um can't go wrong with lg
[5667.20 --> 5674.02]  um can't go wrong with asus rog can't go wrong with acer i mean the reality of it is everyone's using like
[5674.02 --> 5680.86]  at most two to three panels anyway so it all just kind of comes down to you know whose features and
[5680.86 --> 5687.02]  aesthetics you like better and who's on promo um i mean not not entirely there are some models that
[5687.02 --> 5692.58]  are more unique and there are some exclusive features but like even lg's sub one millisecond
[5692.58 --> 5699.60]  ips panels there's other manufacturers that have integrated them now so uh james asks do you think
[5699.60 --> 5709.18]  we'll start to see motherboard redesigns um no i think motherboards are probably going to stay pretty darn
[5709.18 --> 5714.58]  similar to how they are in spite of you know the architectural changes uh pci express gen 4 we're just
[5714.58 --> 5717.54]  going to like plug things into that and they're going to be like faster it's going to be good
[5717.54 --> 5726.14]  apparently xbox series s is 500 in australia with an exchange rate of one usd 2.75 australian dollars
[5726.14 --> 5730.32]  yeah it's always like that you guys it's because it costs a lot to ship stuff there and you don't
[5730.32 --> 5736.56]  have a ton of population so there's inherent like organizational overhead that has to be paid for
[5736.56 --> 5741.58]  somehow and it gets passed along to the consumer i mean hey don't feel too bad about it right
[5741.58 --> 5744.36]  like you pay more than an american but you live in australia
[5744.36 --> 5752.38]  and on that note thanks for tuning into the stream see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[5752.38 --> 5757.52]  goodbye there he is
[5757.52 --> 5783.32]  muted intro people are saying oh did i not unmute it i thought i did
[5783.32 --> 5791.64]  i love this there's a review there's a review of my book by chaython if any non-famous person crapped
[5791.64 --> 5796.84]  out such a garbage book it would not be picked up by anyone if any non-famous oh no it's basically
[5796.84 --> 5799.58]  just the same message again and then a bunch of crap emojis
[5799.58 --> 5825.74]  exactly yes
