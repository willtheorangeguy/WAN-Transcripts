[0.00 → 12.30] and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen second time's a charm we've got a lot of great
[12.30 → 16.52] topics for you guys today, and we're going to do our best as we go through them to sound like we're
[16.52 → 21.68] just learning about them for the first time I mean something I found out about really and
[21.68 → 29.10] legitimately not that long ago was Dr. Disrespect allegedly has been banned permanently from Twitch
[29.10 → 33.86] this is something that's not in our doc the earliest reference I can find to it is from
[33.86 → 39.58] about four or five hours ago, so this is very much breaking news, and we can talk a little bit about
[39.58 → 46.52] what the heck might be going on Twitch right now because they are having a bit of a PR crisis
[46.52 → 54.76] at this moment in time in other news oh yeah more streaming news Microsoft Axis Mixer joins the dark
[54.76 → 59.52] site
[59.52 → 60.52] excuse me sorry oh
[60.52 → 68.20] ah Facebook gaming joins wow uh joins forces with Facebook gaming and there's a bunch of
[68.20 → 75.10] implications there and uh Luke I know you love the CPU topics I know you love it you know you love it
[75.10 → 80.86] tell us about tell us about the CPU this one in particular is actually quite fantastic Intel
[80.86 → 84.66] has the ado platform for all the world the Google games Toshiba which childhood the game
[84.66 → 86.62] and stuff is closely about I don't understand the UC Ex a video so here's a podcast review
[86.62 → 92.06] and I'm going to see what it looks like and listen so Aurora is MGM a demo Islamic
[92.06 → 94.02] 31st symbol me yourriqueured online and ran an Eleven Robert Harrison um and
[94.02 → 98.08] Duke Hanna tried Chen Psydiacois all with with the standup triangle in Tesla
[98.08 → 99.30] and they come on with Celery to defend anyone the Roller of all of them there's a
[99.30 → 101.52] good Ouija Kim doing that just you can do the JoshHHHH Champion playing the
[101.52 → 103.70] multiplayer game that's anyway you all record Campton
[103.70 → 108.90] this topic Microsoft to permanently close all physical retail stores there all of them all of
[108.90 → 114.42] them all the retail stores you have got to be kidding me surprise is the first time okay we
[114.42 → 118.42] say it a lot we say it a lot it's going to be a great show today guys we got a lot to talk about today
[118.42 → 124.74] guys sometimes we sometimes lie we got nothing today we got everything there's so much fire this
[124.74 → 130.02] week okay it's fire it's fire ladies and gentlemen all right we're gonna let's just let's roll the
[130.02 → 138.82] intro and then I want to dive right into that intel thing because it is just brutal oh rolling that intro
[138.82 → 163.54] oh yeah right we have to have some sponsors today uh, uh but uh uh uh moss backpacks vest footwear and
[163.54 → 171.38] anchor with the power expand wow that really sounds a lot dirtier than it probably is
[172.18 → 181.62] power expand whoa it's hot, hot just like the news this week okay uh why don't we jump into this intel
[181.62 → 187.54] thing right off the hop here this was posted they should uh they should enlarge that product stack
[187.54 → 198.34] and get like the power extend the power germinator the power spreader oh, oh wow that
[198.34 → 207.06] is very, very uncomfortable Luke thank you for that mental image swelmo92 posted this on the forum and
[207.06 → 214.58] here's the story underscore row game a respected hardware leaker has just shared some slides from intel
[214.58 → 222.02] comparing gaming performance of their 10th generation 10 750h mobile processors in a MSI gl65 laptop
[222.02 → 229.06] versus the AMD zen 2 r9 4900hs mobile processor in the Zephyrus g14 and if you guys remember from our
[229.06 → 240.74] review of the Zephyrus g14 the dozen 9 4900hs is I think the HS is short for hot stuff because that thing is
[240.74 → 247.22] freaking fire not that it actually runs hot it actually runs really cool its performance is just
[247.22 → 254.50] absolutely outstanding it is right up there when it comes to gaming with AMD's desktop flagship processors
[254.98 → 265.30] um however intel soft fit to put AMD in their place and these slides uh reference here hold on let's
[265.30 → 271.54] see if we can let's see if we can pull these slides up here because this is high freaking various uh
[271.54 → 278.50] uh blah blah blah display capture um let's go ahead and uh not do that actually that's not what I meant
[278.50 → 285.30] to do uh you know what that actually worked out really great um fine sure let's roll with it here we go
[285.30 → 291.54] superior gaming performance for gamers with 10th gen core platforms at a lower price
[291.54 → 299.30] so base is sort of what they um the terminology they use to describe team red over here and then
[299.30 → 315.78] up to 20 better up to 22 better up to 18 better up to 20 better up to 23 better and not to forget up to
[315.78 → 324.98] 23 better again except we've got a small problem here if we just use our technology to enhance
[325.86 → 336.90] enhance enhance enhance enhance okay if we enhanced it enough man this page does not
[336.90 → 341.70] does not enhance simulate very well here we let's let's enhance a different way hold on we've got more
[341.70 → 346.18] enhancing to do let me just enhance this hold on give me a second here ladies and gentlemen there
[346.18 → 352.18] we go kind of weird while you're busy enhancing yeah yeah is that the the used little laptops
[352.18 → 359.22] to display this information, but they look like macBooks oh is that later on in the thing uh we'll
[359.22 → 362.90] have to get to that later give me oh, oh that's cute oh they're little laptops I thought they
[362.90 → 368.90] just had lines under them that's adorable no all right, so this is interesting we've got a core i7 10750h
[368.90 → 375.86] right there got some base clocks and boost clocks got some core counts and TDP ratings and cool stuff
[375.86 → 381.70] like that oh yeah it's a 10 10 watt lower TDP for the AMD processor that's interesting uh also noted in
[381.70 → 392.50] here is NVIDIA RTX 2060 and NVIDIA RTX 2060 max q now that wouldn't normally be as big of a problem except
[392.50 → 401.54] that NVIDIA has gone and created some very confusion around their RTX 2060 because
[401.54 → 409.94] they went and did a little thing where they refreshed their 2070 and 2080 mobile GPUs with super variants
[410.50 → 417.30] and so it was very clear that those had better performance than the 2070 and 2080 that they
[417.30 → 424.74] replaced but then at the same time they went and replaced their 2060 without calling it a super
[424.74 → 432.82] but they made the performance way better so what's actually going on here is the Zephyrus g14
[432.82 → 440.82] is running an older version of the RTX 2060 that doesn't have the super under the hood even though
[440.82 → 448.42] NVIDIA's marketing people didn't see fit to include that bloody information and the intel laptop even
[448.42 → 454.42] though it's running an uh oh yeah sorry is not only not running a max q but seems to be running a full tilt
[455.06 → 462.82] um 2060 so a max p as it's uh sort of colloquially known uh is not only running a max p, but it's also
[462.82 → 469.54] running the newer variant this is this is my this is my understanding of what uh what
[469.54 → 476.42] went down here so uh so at the very least even if the difference in uh hold on a second that's not
[476.42 → 480.98] in my notes the bit about um NVIDIA refreshing the card so maybe they're both new ones you know what
[480.98 → 486.66] it doesn't matter what they should have done at least yeah they should have just they should have
[486.66 → 496.26] just coloured both bars green NVIDIA versus NVIDIA yeah so here's what happened okay at the very
[496.26 → 501.14] least even if into uh NVIDIA's branding thing which I went off about and isn't in my notes so maybe it's
[501.14 → 506.34] not true and I'm I'm very hesitant to like double down on stuff these days even if that isn't what
[506.34 → 515.14] happened at the very least it's a max q versus a max p we are talking a 65 watt GPU versus a 90 watt one
[515.14 → 523.14] and the 65 one 65 watt one is limited to a boost of about 1185 megahertz while the max p one the full
[523.14 → 530.10] tilt one runs at 1560. So that is an increase in clock speed of hold on just a moment here let me do
[530.10 → 537.86] some quick napkin math which I do in a calculator app now because what freaking year is it uh 1560. Hold
[537.86 → 544.26] on Luke can you just refresh me real quick here uh on uh what were the claims that intel made with respect
[544.26 → 551.86] to the performance delta between these two laptops these intel and AMD laptops here at a minimum delta
[551.86 → 560.74] of 18 to 23 18 to 20 percent so 15 60 up to yes what was up to was 18 so how much is 23. How
[560.74 → 568.10] much is 1560 versus 1185 well that happens to be a 31.6 increase in clock speed
[568.10 → 578.98] that's real awkward yeah that's real it's real awkward right now it's got real awkward it's like
[578.98 → 584.10] there's a partial other throttle on the system yeah it's almost stopping it from going that much faster
[584.10 → 589.86] okay I wouldn't, I wouldn't actually I wouldn't actually say that um because I mean I wouldn't
[589.86 → 597.14] actually say what they're saying yeah bumping your GPU clock 25 does not yield 25 more frames per
[597.14 → 604.74] second so I don't want to I don't want to accuse intel of also being slower in addition to uh not
[604.74 → 611.94] doing these benchmarks correctly but here's the problem guys like this is the kind of stuff that
[611.94 → 619.78] makes like it's just embarrassing you know it's just you're either evil or stupid at this point
[619.78 → 626.74] those are the only two options and I will say at least they did it's a little slightly odd that they
[626.74 → 633.38] didn't bull uh I don't know if it's even a bold they didn't highlight in white the graphics card on
[633.38 → 641.86] the Zephyrus g14, but they did on the MSI gl65 at least they did include that information we have seen
[641.86 → 649.14] like inside benchmarks uh completely hide that type of information in the past they could have definitely
[649.14 → 654.98] just included the model of the laptop and not noted the graphics card that's in there because it
[654.98 → 659.30] probably would have covered that unless these are laptops that come in multiple variants but usually
[659.30 → 667.62] there would be a suffix of some kind um, so there's like some things going for them there I guess at
[667.62 → 672.34] least they were very clear about what they were doing they just shouldn't have done it no they
[672.34 → 675.54] shouldn't have done it there's actually quite a few things in here that they shouldn't have done
[675.54 → 683.46] and there's something that really it man one of the reasons this bothers me is that when intel destroys
[683.46 → 688.02] their own credibility they go and destroy the credibility of people that they work with as well
[688.02 → 693.22] this has been bothering me since last night when I was reading the comments on a tech wiki video that
[693.22 → 701.70] we did on what exactly is a process node because I think to the layperson it's not really clear
[701.70 → 712.82] like why it is that 14 nanometre versus 10 nanometers is you know a full process node shrink you know or
[712.82 → 720.82] you know why is it that um why is it that going from 14 to 10 is a process node whereas going from
[720.82 → 728.82] uh hold on i it's hard to do this math in my head so hold on 90 times 0.7 equals uh 60.
[728.82 → 732.58] while you're doing that another thing that would have been really nice is if they actually
[732.58 → 739.62] like using base for every single one of uh the AMD performance lines is kind of annoying
[739.62 → 743.38] oh we can get back to that the baseline is actually zero okay there's a bunch of stuff in there we're
[743.38 → 746.98] we're going to get don't worry we're going to get back to that we're going to get back to that, but we did a
[746.98 → 752.10] video basically just explaining why it is that you have to go from 90 nanometers all the way down to 65
[752.10 → 758.50] and then you only have to go from 14 nanometers down to 10 and then from 10 down to 7 to qualify
[758.50 → 766.26] as a full process node and the comments on we reached out to intel to get some clarification on
[766.26 → 774.18] this subject because they were kind of there the whole time um and the video is nothing but factual
[774.18 → 781.30] and the people that we were talking to at intel were not just you know marketing dangers um or
[781.30 → 788.10] anything like that like they were actual technical people who we talked to um and instead of people
[788.10 → 793.62] just being able to look at this video and go hey here's some information about a thing that I didn't
[793.62 → 801.38] know about it's now stained by some of the marketing that intel is doing so when I said in the video
[801.38 → 807.62] um you know hey you got to remember that the process node is not the be-all and end-all people
[807.62 → 812.98] are misinterpreting that as some kind of intel talking point that was actually something that i
[812.98 → 819.06] added on my own not because you got to remember a lot of intel's marketing over the years has been
[819.06 → 827.38] around how many freaking nanometres they're at, and this video was an explainer of how that number and
[827.38 → 833.30] the meaning of it has actually shifted over time it's just informative it wasn't sponsored by intel
[833.94 → 838.90] and the information that's in the video is nothing to do with intel's current marketing messaging
[838.90 → 844.42] when I said that the thing that I was actually thinking of was NVIDIA versus AMD right now
[845.54 → 852.34] AMD is a node ahead of NVIDIA and getting absolutely curb stomped in terms of everything from performance
[852.34 → 859.38] to efficiency that is just the situation the reality of it is that not everything is just down
[859.38 → 864.90] to how many nanometres you have another example that I didn't get into in depth in the video because
[864.90 → 870.02] it was beyond the scope of the tech quickie like it's supposed to be quick it's supposed to be focused
[870.02 → 877.86] was that you can optimize a given manufacturing process like a given you know nanometre size a given
[877.86 → 883.94] transistor size you can optimize it for high power parts or low power parts I remember we ran into this
[883.94 → 892.90] when man which node was NVIDIA stuck on for freaking ever in the maxwell days um it escapes me right now
[892.90 → 899.70] it doesn't really matter the point is that there were smaller processes available, but they were more
[899.70 → 905.86] optimized for high efficiency low power parts and were not properly optimized for a GPU which is why
[905.86 → 912.42] NVIDIA opted to stay on a previous node that had better optimizations for their use case versus
[912.42 → 918.02] just jumping to a node for the sake of having a lower you know nanometre number that they could put in
[918.02 → 922.74] their marketing that's the point i was trying to make and yet the comment section on this video is full
[922.74 → 930.74] of people accusing me intel basically accusing intel and by extension me of trying to downplay that AMD
[930.74 → 936.10] is on seven nanometre and intel is still stuck on 14 nanometers for a lot of their products and just
[936.10 → 941.38] finally shipping some 10 nanometre stuff, and it's like no that wasn't even one of the things intel
[941.38 → 945.86] mentioned that was just something that I felt was important for people to know and another thing that i
[945.86 → 951.38] said at the end of the video and this is really pissing me off right now was I said that at the
[951.38 → 958.34] end of the day when you are shopping for a computer processor it comes down to the real world performance
[958.34 → 965.86] in the applications that you actually use and because of intel's stupid statements that they've
[965.86 → 974.26] been making recently about how pretty much downplaying actual real world performance in real benchmarks
[974.26 → 979.78] because they're making the argument that a lot of people don't use those particular applications
[981.30 → 986.58] I'm getting caught up in this kind of crossfire where people are saying I'm some kind of intel
[986.58 → 991.22] shill because I'm saying real world performance and applications that you use is what is important
[991.22 → 997.54] when you shop for a product that is true that is true today it'll be true 10 years from now it was
[997.54 → 1003.70] true 10 years and 20 years ago, and it has absolutely nothing to do with intel's marketing the problem is
[1003.70 → 1009.86] that intel is muddying the waters they're taking a benchmark like cine bench, and they're saying well we
[1009.86 → 1014.26] should be putting less emphasis on this, and we should be putting more emphasis on the applications that
[1014.26 → 1021.06] people are legitimately using every day the problem is that here we've got a slide from this great
[1021.06 → 1027.06] article over on videocards.com hold on where does this slide go and for video editing they're using
[1028.10 → 1034.10] magic's fast cut plus the is magic's fast cut plus and who the is using it
[1036.10 → 1043.38] how is that more real world than like you know cinema 4d which is an actual application that real
[1043.38 → 1051.22] actual professionals do use, so people are drawing this false parallel between what I said which is
[1051.22 → 1056.58] that if you're going to shop for if all you ever do is play Fortnite that's that's all you do you go
[1056.58 → 1060.98] to work you get home you turn on your computer you play Fortnite you go to sleep you wake up in the
[1060.98 → 1065.62] morning you go to work rinse and repeat that's all you do then the only thing that matters to you when
[1065.62 → 1071.86] you choose a CPU is how many fps you get in Fortnite that's it that's all that matters because that's what
[1071.86 → 1076.82] you actually do with your computer you shouldn't buy a processor based on how good it is at running
[1076.82 → 1085.06] cine bench or how good it is at running Adobe Premiere or whatever the case may be that is a 100 truth the
[1085.06 → 1092.90] issue is that intel is using that truth as a shield and then twisting the narrative around to applications
[1092.90 → 1095.86] that people don't necessarily use
[1099.62 → 1104.74] that was intense that was my rant I was just really upset by people when I was reading the
[1104.74 → 1110.58] comments on that video because an I'm being accused of being a paid shill when I'm not all we did is
[1110.58 → 1115.70] talk to people at intel who told gave us real information nothing to do with these dumb slides
[1115.70 → 1121.22] which I promise you we are going to get back to in a moment here and people not understanding the video
[1121.22 → 1126.58] it was a bit of a deeper dive video and I can see how some people who think they're very smart and very
[1126.58 → 1132.66] perceptive and oh I'm seeing through the BS on this actually just had no idea what I was talking about
[1132.66 → 1137.54] and defaulted to criticizing instead of just trying to actually understand what I was saying
[1137.54 → 1142.50] I can see how there might have been some of that but um you know there's just no excuse for it
[1142.50 → 1146.34] if you don't understand the video don't leave a comment there was nothing in that video that was wrong
[1146.34 → 1152.90] and I said nothing in that video that was uh that was an intel marketing point that wasn't just
[1152.90 → 1158.98] completely correct now let's get into the problems with intel's marketing that are making them look
[1158.98 → 1167.38] bad making me look bad and making their partners look bad okay I'm going back to display capture guys
[1167.38 → 1173.54] you can check out this full thing over on videocards.com it really is worth a look-loo because
[1174.26 → 1178.82] there's some there's some just kind of shockingly frustrating stuff in here sorry I'm just going
[1178.82 → 1187.30] to give it a little resized size here so you guys can get a good look here so all right market landscape
[1187.30 → 1194.90] blah blah blah now these slides were limited distribution not for end users but the reality of it is if
[1194.90 → 1200.98] you're intel you're kind of a big voice and whenever you say something people sit up and take notice so you
[1200.98 → 1206.18] can't pretend that when you're saying something it's not going to eventually end up in front of
[1206.18 → 1211.70] the eyeballs of end users it's just the way that it works I'm sorry guys I don't make the rules we live
[1211.70 → 1217.46] in the information age yeah you got to deal with that um what do pc users actually do office applications
[1217.46 → 1221.62] games media consumption light content creation and game streaming and this seems to be colour coded
[1221.62 → 1227.22] according to I don't know what this colour coding is this is stupid these are stupid colours all right
[1227.22 → 1234.18] so chrome has a popularity of 63 I don't know why they would arbitrarily isolate chrome as web
[1234.18 → 1238.58] browsing I would say if you just said web browsing it would have a popularity of a hundred percent but
[1238.58 → 1248.66] you know whatever minor details uh word steam WinRAR yeah sure uh I mean oh man see okay, okay we got
[1248.66 → 1254.50] some problems here like this is people making this slide that I feel like don't properly understand
[1254.50 → 1261.22] how people use their computers WinRAR might have a popularity of 37 percent in the sense that 37 percent
[1261.22 → 1265.54] of people have it or something similar installed on their computer when it comes to the percentage of
[1265.54 → 1272.66] time that I actually spend using WinRAR like what fraction of a percent would that be for you Luke
[1273.54 → 1274.58] I don't
[1276.66 → 1282.82] I haven't used okay I haven't used WinRAR in extremely long yeah I haven't used WinRAR specifically in a very
[1282.82 → 1291.14] long time but a like application I would say like some tiny decimal of a percentage
[1291.14 → 1298.34] sure yeah someone in chat said 0.00001 yeah, yeah like once in a while when I download something that
[1298.34 → 1304.34] for whatever reason doesn't go straight into uh like a game launcher um all right so WinRAR and
[1304.34 → 1311.14] you could make the argument that unzipping games is also like a WinRAR like application so I guess I do it
[1311.14 → 1314.98] a little more often than that point zero zero zero zero one percent or whatever uh but let's have a
[1314.98 → 1320.82] look at some of the other things that are showing up as popular uses uh obs at five percent
[1320.82 → 1326.18] I actually find that very hard to believe what how are you getting I find all these that's the
[1326.18 → 1330.90] problem with these numbers is it's not like this is an invalid exercise figuring out what people
[1330.90 → 1336.82] actually do with their computers and then determining the value of your product compared to your competitor
[1336.82 → 1341.54] by looking at these things people actually do with their computers i just don't understand
[1342.18 → 1350.50] these numbers' outlook is 17.6 when was the last time the CPU made a difference to outlook performance
[1351.06 → 1358.50] and how do you how could you possibly say that obs has a five percent popularity what does that even mean
[1358.50 → 1372.58] i so i I think these slides are probably for people that are like the product managers at various
[1372.58 → 1380.42] companies and I think it is a little bit negatively manipulative for that reason but I don't it's probably
[1380.42 → 1388.02] not okay some of them like I'm extremely surprised 21.27 on VLC i was gonna that was my next one that
[1388.02 → 1396.90] was my next one there's no way there's just no way yeah um CSGO is also written really weird there
[1396.90 → 1401.38] there 's's some stuff in here that's really weird but like being putting a thing up and being
[1401.38 → 1407.22] like look this is what most people use is not useless to a product manager that might be a little
[1407.22 → 1414.10] bit spaced, but it's being misused I think absolutely these numbers feel very arbitrary so then we move on
[1414.10 → 1420.66] to some of the other slides here gaming uh the 9700k outperforms 3950x in popular games fair
[1420.66 → 1428.10] point um I don't know that I would say that Far Cry New Dawn and Far Cry 5 are especially popular games
[1428.10 → 1436.02] right now at this moment um or almost any of these to be completely fair well world of shadow of war is
[1436.02 → 1443.06] kind of old game uh well there yeah it kind of is Far Cry New Dawn is kind of old total Warhammer 2
[1443.06 → 1446.34] total Warhammer 2 that's that's actually current
[1448.66 → 1454.10] there's a bunch of these that people definitely play but like this is not if is we want to go back
[1454.10 → 1460.34] up to what the pc users actually do uh graph if you try to apply that to these games they're going
[1460.34 → 1466.66] to be really low percentages yes uh okay so now let's talk frequency advantage drives intel's gaming
[1466.66 → 1471.14] leadership okay so like we and like some of these examples sorry to just jump back in yeah like world
[1471.14 → 1481.38] of tanks like yeah okay if you have a 9700k you're probably fine in world of tanks if you have a dozen 9 3950x
[1481.94 → 1487.30] you're fine in world of tanks so like you're not yeah intel needs to get their story straight because
[1487.30 → 1493.14] they can say that you know oh yeah it's only applicable to a small percentage of users uh you
[1493.14 → 1500.18] know cinema 4d which they have on there as 0.54 or Adobe Premiere which they have on as 3.7 that's only
[1500.18 → 1507.14] applicable to a small percentage of users I would make the argument that an 11 to 18 fps improvement in
[1507.78 → 1512.90] most games is only applicable to competitive players who are a very small percentage of users
[1512.90 → 1520.66] um and a much better chart that they could have given is these are the applications uh this is the
[1520.66 → 1526.10] percentage of usage of these various applications that someone who's actually in the market for this
[1526.10 → 1531.78] processor will use not people that just use computers in general so they want to kind
[1531.78 → 1536.02] of have their cake and eat it too or excuse me eat their cake and have it too I've been corrected on
[1536.02 → 1540.34] that it actually makes a lot more sense that way um so they want to say okay well these things aren't
[1540.34 → 1545.54] that important so we should like to ignore them but also rah, rah we've got this thing that I would make
[1545.54 → 1555.14] the argument that once you get beyond probably in the neighbourhood of 75 to 120 or so fps it is a point
[1555.14 → 1562.26] of extremely diminishing returns for the vast majority of people I consider myself pretty sensitive to low
[1562.26 → 1569.94] fps like if there's a stutter or a frame rate dip I'm going to feel it if I get down to 70 to 85 fps but beyond
[1569.94 → 1576.34] about 100 I usually can't tell especially if I'm using like um a refresh rate synchronization
[1576.34 → 1583.54] technology like g-sync or free sync okay moving on frequency drives intel's gaming leadership yes having
[1583.54 → 1588.66] higher frequency versus more cores is more important for gaming these days and there's a reason that they
[1588.66 → 1594.66] chose the 9700k specifically it's a six core processor and boosting up the frequency does tend to give you
[1594.66 → 1599.94] better return yeah that's fair uh hold on a second where's your power consumption slide I don't see
[1599.94 → 1606.42] one that's unfortunate anyway um CPU performance based on real world usage yes this is a CPU that
[1606.42 → 1612.58] costs half as much but AMD could easily pick and choose their comparer points as well they could just
[1612.58 → 1619.22] as easily have taken intel's 9900ks special edition, or you know 10 900k or whatever and compared it to
[1619.22 → 1624.58] something like a 3600 or 3600x, and they would have also looked perfect in terms of price
[1624.58 → 1630.42] performance you don't get to take your value gaming chip and put it up against someone else's flagship
[1630.42 → 1634.98] chip they should have put it up against a 3800x or something like that something that's at least
[1634.98 → 1640.26] remotely price comparable now we get on to the everyday workload slide like this whole thing just
[1640.90 → 1647.22] really annoys me so that's where we've got this stupid magic fast cut plus powered by intel quick sync
[1647.22 → 1651.94] video up to 2.7 times faster yeah that's the problem with quick sync video though is that
[1652.58 → 1660.34] the support for it is so limited that it's sort of a's sort of a nothingburger like when you can
[1660.34 → 1666.34] find something that uses if it's awesome but the reality of it is that when it comes to video editing
[1666.34 → 1672.74] most people are not using that tool most people are using Adobe Creative Cloud and if they can't afford
[1672.74 → 1677.86] Adobe Creative Cloud they are either using da Vinci resolve or they are pirating Adobe Creative Cloud
[1679.86 → 1684.82] look I don't make the rules Luke like, but that's yeah that's the way it is, or they're on final cut
[1684.82 → 1690.02] because they're using a mac very few people are actually able to take advantage of that 2.7 times
[1690.02 → 1696.02] faster which is a very real advantage and when you use you know something like uh when you use it you
[1696.02 → 1701.14] know an actual dedicated encoding application, and you can take advantage of that path it really is fast
[1701.14 → 1708.90] but GPUs are also catching up so adobe in the latest beta of premiere and media encoder added support
[1708.90 → 1716.18] for Cuba so it's now faster and supposedly without a quality drawback, although we haven't actually tested
[1716.18 → 1723.38] that internally yet um but why you know why make the apples to apples comparison of the intel chip with
[1723.38 → 1729.22] NVIDIA encoding and the AMD chip with NVIDIA encoding when you can pick and like cherry cherry-pick this
[1729.22 → 1736.58] example where you get to be 2.7 times faster ah office productivity this is great eight
[1736.58 → 1743.06] percent better office productivity I mean like man we need the Pepsi challenge back ladies and gentlemen
[1743.06 → 1748.50] do you think you could detect eight percent better uh PowerPoint this productivity no PowerPoint
[1748.50 → 1756.26] performance in a blind taste test nope I would like to say that I could, I would like to say that I am that
[1756.26 → 1761.94] sensitive towards performance improvements but uh in productivity suites I'm not going to notice it
[1762.50 → 1768.90] I might be able to potentially at certain levels of performance within gaming but not office
[1768.90 → 1774.74] productivity which isn't to say that there's anything necessarily wrong with pointing out that
[1774.74 → 1781.30] in seamark 2018 you have up to seven percent better scores compared to your competitor that cost twice as
[1781.30 → 1788.18] much there's nothing inherently wrong with saying hey well you know yeah seven percent might not be a
[1788.18 → 1793.94] big deal but hey seven percent is better than a kick in the teeth ain't if it's just that they didn't
[1793.94 → 1803.14] manage to find any application where AMD outperformed them even though those things do exist so and the
[1803.14 → 1811.46] thing is when you have a list of charts like this where like you, you start with that one that's
[1811.46 → 1818.58] just brutal of like the which we need to get back to still the like no numbers on either side of the
[1818.58 → 1824.26] graph AMD is listed as base up to whatever percentage we use a different graphics card all this other kind
[1824.26 → 1831.14] of stuff every single other slide after that what the heck every single slide after that becomes highly
[1831.14 → 1837.22] questionable and now we're going to look at things like the the the small amount of desktop
[1837.22 → 1843.30] uh sorry not desktop uh productivity suite performance increase which normally we would just scroll
[1843.30 → 1848.50] over that slide and be like yeah whatever I don't really care it doesn't matter and move forward um
[1849.62 → 1855.22] but now if we want to call it out because we want to call everything out just you can avoid
[1855.22 → 1863.46] these problems by just not being fishy in the first place yeah here's a really weird one like when
[1863.46 → 1869.70] okay you know what I'm I'm not going to go too hard at this next slide because uh based on the timing i
[1869.70 → 1876.10] think that um AMD's zen 2 value processors might not have been out yet so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[1876.10 → 1882.82] slam them for this uh intel really did deliver a better gaming experience on the low end uh before AMD was
[1882.82 → 1892.50] uh had zen 2 uh chips available so the dozen 3100 and 3300 those are killer um the 3400g really
[1892.50 → 1896.26] was probably not worth settling for gaming so I'm not going to go after them for that so let's go
[1896.26 → 1902.10] back to that one slide that you had wanted to talk about uh which one was the one you wanted one quick
[1902.10 → 1908.50] thing before we go back yeah um if you look at the very next slide after everyday workloads yep elite
[1909.14 → 1913.62] real world performance for gaming and creating yeah this is all versus their last gen I think
[1914.34 → 1920.34] you also notice what they included hold on a second can I have a look here wait why is video editing in
[1920.34 → 1925.30] here oh gaming and creating okay sure fine versus three okay they just pick and choose what they're
[1925.30 → 1933.38] comparing against okay look at the video editing application that is used oh no what is it I can't
[1933.38 → 1941.14] even tell premiere wait what now they use premiere they have the logo right there PR oh there it is
[1941.14 → 1948.26] oh you have to be kidding me that is ridiculous okay i you know what that's really ridiculous you're right
[1948.26 → 1952.98] you're right but I'm gonna I'm going to move on to more cherry-picking here, and they just seem to have
[1952.98 → 1959.38] seemingly arbitrarily chosen what they want to compare against here the games hold on a second uh let me just
[1959.38 → 1966.18] let me just move this elite real world performance here we go so up to 33 percent more uh whatever this
[1966.18 → 1974.10] is this what is this gaming uh more fps versus their own previous gen okay up to 81 percent more
[1974.10 → 1983.78] versus three-year-old pc uh okay up to 187 fps what does that what does that even mean up to 2x better mega
[1983.78 → 1990.02] tasking what am I like what am I even okay three-year-old pc never mind i I only saw that over here
[1990.02 → 1994.66] that's okay previous gen okay, okay all right, so these are all internal comparisons against
[1994.66 → 1998.90] their own stuff so that's fine I'm less mad about that but still the percentage stuff I'm not too worried
[1998.90 → 2006.58] about it's just the fact that they they they cherry-picked their example that no one uses previously
[2006.58 → 2011.86] yeah video editing, and then they went, and they used premiere when it mattered yeah, and they're like well we know
[2011.86 → 2016.66] we know this one's the actually important one so we're going to include it in this later slide
[2016.66 → 2023.62] and just hope nobody notices so here's the bottom line real world performance matters intel is not
[2024.66 → 2034.10] wrong in that sense the thing that is wrong is taking someone else's benchmark that you feel is not
[2034.10 → 2041.54] real world representative enough and substituting your own equally not representative of the real world
[2042.02 → 2047.94] benchmark okay when I said in that video I'm going back to the comments on that tech quickie video again
[2047.94 → 2056.02] when I said in that video that real world performance is what matters that is like age-old wisdom that
[2056.02 → 2064.26] comes from back when CPU reviews used to contain almost nothing but the following stupid meaningless
[2064.26 → 2070.66] arbitrary synthetic benchmarks like soft Sandra which just measures things like millions of instructions per
[2070.66 → 2078.10] seconds which doesn't necessarily translate to the real world okay so a purely synthetic benchmark it
[2078.10 → 2086.58] would also contain things like um oh yes right synthetic gaming benchmarks like 3d mark 2001 or whatever
[2086.58 → 2093.62] back then the tools to measure the fps of real games were much more rudimentary very, very difficult to
[2093.62 → 2098.98] use if you could get anything working at all um and you couldn't get the same amount of like detail you
[2098.98 → 2102.18] know frame times and stuff like that we didn't have tools for measuring it so you'd get these
[2102.18 → 2107.86] synthetic games that ultimately could be meaningless you could have one CPU that performs twice as good
[2107.86 → 2113.38] in you know 3d mark and then half as well in an actual game that people are actually playing so that's why
[2113.38 → 2118.18] that was important getting away from synthetic game benchmarks and then the other thing that you'd have
[2118.18 → 2122.42] was uh oh what was the other one that I had wanted to point out right yeah totally unrealistic
[2122.42 → 2132.26] real world gaming applications like people would run you know quake 3 at 640 by 480 uh just to show you
[2132.26 → 2140.02] know what the maximum fps that a CPU could drive was when you remove the GPU as a bottleneck and there is
[2140.02 → 2146.26] still some validity particularly to that last one because it does tell you okay when you remove the GPU as
[2146.26 → 2151.46] a bottleneck how many fps can you get so it's like turning a game all the way down to low settings and saying
[2151.46 → 2159.54] which one at the the end of the day is the better like gaming CPU um so you're trying to
[2159.54 → 2164.98] effectively like extrapolate to when games get more demanding you know which one is going to keep up
[2164.98 → 2173.38] for longer um, but that doesn't inform how the user is actually going to use the computer none of those
[2173.38 → 2179.62] things do and that's why there was a big shift to real world benchmarks and whether intel likes it or not
[2179.62 → 2185.14] cinema 4d is a real world application that real people do actually use even if it's very few of
[2185.14 → 2191.06] them and one of the nice things about it for a reviewer is that it tends to give us a really quick
[2191.06 → 2198.66] look at you know what to expect in an application that scales really well across multiple cores so it's
[2198.66 → 2206.26] not synthetic and if you don't like you know cinema 4d or cine bench or whatever you could say that you
[2206.26 → 2210.42] could say that specific benchmark we don't feel is applicable to many people and i and they have
[2210.42 → 2215.78] said that, but you don't get to then pick your own random benchmarks or real world applications that
[2215.78 → 2222.50] nobody uses and substitute those that is my point and that all is all I have to say about it now intel
[2222.50 → 2228.74] stop embarrassing yourself and stop embarrassing me because I have the know poor sense to talk to
[2228.74 → 2234.10] you about something as basic as you know what a die shrink means and then have people jump down my throat
[2234.10 → 2238.82] because they think that what I'm saying is somehow part of your dumb benchmarking
[2241.30 → 2246.50] I'm calm now you want to talk about dr disrespect getting banned from twitch
[2248.34 → 2253.14] wait Luke I can't hear you I can't hear you Luke right sorry there's people cheering outside my window
[2253.14 → 2258.74] so I need him I'm like uh maybe talk to shroud about how you should present some of this stuff before you
[2258.74 → 2264.18] present some of the stuff and stop assuming that just because you put a usage guideline limited
[2264.18 → 2268.90] distribution not suitable for end user messaging that it's not going to leak all of these things
[2268.90 → 2273.54] and besides if it's not suitable for if it's not suitable for end user messaging it's not suitable for
[2273.54 → 2279.22] partner messaging you just shouldn't be saying it if you wouldn't say it to a customer if it could be
[2279.22 → 2284.66] considered misleading to say to a customer you should never say it to anyone that's that should be your
[2284.66 → 2288.58] rule and I thought you were talking to me when you're like talk to shroud I'm like why do I have
[2288.58 → 2293.94] to talk to shroud i I don't need to talk to shroud i know shroud knows this stuff so we're
[2293.94 → 2298.82] talking about Ryan shroud who used to run pc perspective and is now at intel like that's all
[2298.82 → 2304.82] these guys have to do talk to shroud because he would be able to look at that that slide deck and say
[2304.82 → 2311.46] whoa we cannot show this to anybody all right let's talk about dr disrespect getting banned from twitch
[2311.46 → 2318.82] so I have no idea if these two things are related, but there has been uh a sort of resurgence in the
[2318.82 → 2326.82] hashtag me too movement this time uh quite laser focused on twitch we don't technically know that
[2326.82 → 2335.70] this one is in line with that I don't personally see any public anything yet about it that has nothing
[2335.70 → 2340.74] no real information what we could be we have no idea what we do know and the reason that I was
[2340.74 → 2345.62] tying those things together is not because I think i I don't remember his real name unfortunately but
[2345.62 → 2351.62] uh not because I think that uh loop something is it you know it doesn't matter uh not because i
[2351.62 → 2356.98] think that um these things are necessarily directly related or that he was involved in any kind of sexual
[2356.98 → 2362.90] misconduct I have no idea I don't know the guy but um what I think it could be related to is
[2363.78 → 2369.54] platforms like twitch suddenly realizing and I don't know why it took this long that they really
[2369.54 → 2376.10] need to take some responsibility for the people that they partner with because that's what the meaning
[2376.10 → 2384.74] of the word partner is when you're a twitch partner you are partnered and whether you know whether
[2384.74 → 2390.90] you know you're Amazon and you put in your contract that uh you know I cannot in any way um
[2390.90 → 2396.90] uh imply that I am associated with Amazon or affiliated that's the word because
[2396.90 → 2402.58] it used to be called Amazon affiliate, and they changed it to Amazon associates so uh in the contract
[2402.58 → 2408.74] it says that I can't say that I'm affiliated with Amazon formally in any way um, but you actually still go
[2408.74 → 2414.66] to affiliate-amazon.com or whatever it is to access the Amazon associates program so whenever you have a
[2414.66 → 2420.58] word like affiliate I think that's why Amazon got rid of it or partner you create this perception that
[2420.58 → 2427.14] you are you know working together, and they are they're they're giving money to this individual
[2427.14 → 2431.86] or these individuals and these individuals are creating content for their platform it is a
[2431.86 → 2438.82] partnership it's a symbiotic partnership and I think what twitch is realizing as part of this me too
[2438.82 → 2444.26] moment that is happening on twitch right now where everyone from prominent streamers to partner
[2444.26 → 2453.06] managers is being accused of impropriety right now is that holy crap it actually reflects on us when our
[2453.06 → 2464.74] partners do stuff that is terrible so I don't know ultimately what dr disrespect did part of his character is
[2464.74 → 2472.50] being disrespectful, and he has definitely done stuff that I think um you know if he were employed at
[2472.50 → 2478.18] more of a conventional media organization like a news outlet for example would have gotten him
[2478.18 → 2483.86] absolutely fired and completely unhirable ever again like that incident where he live-streamed in a
[2483.86 → 2491.38] public bathroom um so I don't know exactly what he did I suspect that it's just well even if it's not
[2491.38 → 2497.62] directly related to what's going on right now with hashtag me too over on twitch it is probably
[2497.62 → 2507.78] related to some kind of thing that I find believable that he might have done um and they probably
[2507.78 → 2513.62] just want to create some distance now I have a bit of a tinfoil hat theory but I'm gonna wait until
[2513.62 → 2520.82] uh you see if Luke has sort of two cents to chime in here first tinfoil hat theory is coming though um i I have
[2521.62 → 2526.58] heard a bunch of different ideas on this and as far as I know there's no there's no publicly i
[2526.58 → 2532.58] can't wait asserted ones that are solved the one I don't watch his stream I don't really watch twitch
[2532.58 → 2537.06] streams in general every once in a while I jump on summit stream because I find his GTA RP stuff really
[2537.06 → 2543.70] entertaining sure and I like it when you play cf um but I'm not really a twitch viewer but uh there's
[2543.70 → 2552.82] apparently some potential theories that it could be an um what is it FTC violation due to some
[2552.82 → 2559.62] undisclosed sponsorships' oh that seems no I don't know you know what that doesn't make sense to me
[2559.62 → 2567.78] though because my understanding of those guidelines is that ultimately they fall back on the individual or
[2567.78 → 2572.82] excuse me on the brand not on the individual themselves now I haven't looked at the guidelines
[2572.82 → 2577.38] lately because for us, it's a lot easier to just make sure that our disclosures are all in line
[2577.94 → 2583.38] um than to you know figure out what the consequences are but when I went back through this a while ago
[2583.38 → 2588.90] someone submitted a complaint to some kind of Canadian regulatory body that uh we weren't disclosing
[2588.90 → 2596.58] sponsorships um so I went through and i I really immersed myself in the in the um in the
[2596.58 → 2601.62] documentation for this stuff I went through both the American and Canadian ones because I'm Canadian
[2601.62 → 2605.94] and a lot of our partners are American I felt like I needed to understand it on both sides of the border
[2605.94 → 2612.74] and we ultimately were uh found by the Canadian organization to have not been um in violation of
[2612.74 → 2618.18] anything of their standards uh because they accused us of not disclosing a sponsorship but i
[2618.18 → 2622.82] was like this video that they flagged here we disclosed the sponsorship literally three times
[2622.82 → 2627.70] once verbally uh again in text and then a third time verbally it's like what are you talking about
[2627.70 → 2633.70] um anyway the point is the last time I looked at it my understanding was that when there was a
[2633.70 → 2640.18] violation it ultimately reflected on the brand that was paying not on the influencer themselves so
[2640.18 → 2647.30] there was sort of a really um sort of wild west era there anywhere from probably three to ten years ago
[2647.30 → 2652.98] where what was happening was brands did not properly understand these guidelines slash they didn't
[2652.98 → 2659.54] exist yet and influencers didn't care because ultimately nothing bad could happen to them so
[2659.54 → 2665.62] there were a lot of undisclosed sponsorships going around well here's the problem brands started to
[2665.62 → 2672.58] wise up when I think it what was it uh Xbox got in trouble when they had a bunch of like undisclosed uh
[2672.58 → 2677.14] partnerships around the Xbox One launch they had people playing games and not disclosing that they
[2677.14 → 2683.30] were sponsored by Microsoft you remember that Luke uh yes I think that was sort of like a watershed
[2683.30 → 2687.46] moment for all of this when everyone kind of woke up and went oh it's actually Microsoft that they're
[2687.46 → 2694.10] going to go after so it is very typical now for non-shady companies to have really, really strict
[2694.10 → 2699.94] guidelines in their partner contracts about how you have to disclose, and it's all in line with the FTC now
[2699.94 → 2705.30] there 's's lots of companies that don't bother or don't understand it or think they're just going
[2705.30 → 2712.74] to skirt around it and I have seen still even now like even as recently as this year and last year
[2712.74 → 2721.22] um some videos go up that I know for a fact are sponsored because like you know I worked on a video
[2721.22 → 2727.70] with the brand at around that same time with similar a similar spin on it similar messaging but for whatever
[2727.70 → 2733.06] reason mine is disclosed and the other people isn't um or ones where I know from talking to the
[2733.06 → 2736.58] brand like who they're working with and I see the video go up and I'm like oh yeah that's uh
[2738.26 → 2742.82] not disclosed that's interesting um so it's definitely still happening, but it's not
[2742.82 → 2750.98] nearly as prevalent as it was even two three years ago um so yeah can i go tinfoil hat for a second
[2750.98 → 2759.62] here yeah okay I think that it could be any reason I think it could be some kind of accusation I think
[2759.62 → 2763.46] it could be uh whatever the thing you said that sounded credible was some kind of undisclosed
[2763.46 → 2770.42] sponsorship thing I think it could be that I think that um he's probably done enough things that are
[2770.42 → 2776.58] bannable at this point that um there was some theory there was some theory in the past that he would
[2776.58 → 2782.74] intentionally get himself in trouble uh sure yep trying to get temp bans and stuff like that because
[2782.74 → 2787.62] it really actually lined up quite well with his character yeah with his brand, and it gets him a
[2787.62 → 2794.10] bunch of press okay so whatever the reason is part of me kind of goes you know what maybe it actually
[2794.10 → 2800.58] doesn't matter maybe what twitch is realizing is like I said before they have a responsibility to their
[2800.58 → 2806.34] brand to associate or partner with people who are going to reflect on it positively and maybe
[2806.34 → 2811.46] they're having a little bit of buyer's remorse about that exclusivity deal that they signed with
[2811.46 → 2821.14] them and at this point the cost of not having him on the platform is less than the cost of paying him
[2821.14 → 2823.46] not to go to a platform that no longer exists
[2825.86 → 2834.10] because they just paid him reportedly an enormous sum of money millions and millions of dollars to not go
[2834.10 → 2838.18] over to mixer because realistically nobody was going over to Facebook gaming if any of the scuttlebutt is
[2838.18 → 2845.62] to be believed um both ninja and shroud were offered significantly more than their existing mixer contracts
[2845.62 → 2851.22] to make the migration over to Facebook gaming and didn't do it because nobody with a brand to protect
[2851.22 → 2858.10] right now wants it associated with Facebook in any way outside of like the Norrie sphere like if is you
[2858.10 → 2864.18] have like a tech-savvy or like a media savvy audience you do not want any association with Facebook I mean
[2864.18 → 2873.14] aren't they going through like a corporate um a boycott right now I think I saw that uh oh who was it
[2873.14 → 2879.22] Unilever just uh just boycotted advertising on Facebook or something like that doesn't know there's been a lot of pullouts
[2879.22 → 2888.18] um let me just double-check make sure uh and yeah yeah Unilever uh pulled out of both Facebook and uh
[2888.18 → 2895.54] a Twitter I believe Verizon pledged to uh pull ads from Facebook so like that is a super toxic brand so
[2895.54 → 2900.82] realistically the only thing left is YouTube gaming and if I'm YouTube gaming I'm not going to be signing
[2900.82 → 2906.50] any like gigantic uh gigantic deals right now I'm just going to let this toxicity on twitch play out and
[2906.50 → 2910.74] I'm going to sit there and go oh thank goodness I'm not in the news right now this is wonderful
[2913.70 → 2921.46] so i kind of wonder if part of the timing is you know hey this guy was already toxic um now that
[2921.46 → 2927.06] we've made this big splash partnering with him, it reflects on us even more uh and I wonder if they
[2927.06 → 2932.42] were just waiting for him to do something bannable that simple and save themselves some money
[2932.42 → 2939.70] yep they very recently signed an I don't have the exact date or the exact value on this
[2939.70 → 2946.66] uh but they very recently I think it was within the last two years signed a very large yeah it was so
[2946.66 → 2952.10] when all those streamers are being poached by mixer they signed a big exclusivity contract with him
[2952.10 → 2961.94] so it still sounds a little bit surprising um that they dropped him you know yeah um it's a huge deal
[2961.94 → 2966.74] and I mean the thing is like I think at the end of the day the doc is probably going to be okay
[2967.70 → 2976.58] but getting deplatformed is extremely traumatic like i can probably count on my hands and toes
[2976.58 → 2985.78] or my fingers and toes the number of people that um have six not just successfully but have but
[2985.78 → 2990.82] that have thrived moving from one platform over to another um
[2993.30 → 2999.06] yeah what's yeah sometimes it works okay when you continue on the previous platform um
[2999.06 → 3007.38] um but fully switching is often not super fantastic yeah um as we saw in a topic we're
[3007.38 → 3013.62] going to be going into with uh with ninja and shroud moving over to mixer oh yeah uh let's get through

[3169.94 → 3175.46] much sir um so I started just wearing them for bike rides, and then they're really convenient to slip on
[3175.46 → 3180.58] and slip off so I've started just wearing them to like go take out the garbage baby steps I rarely leave
[3180.58 → 3185.14] the house in them, you know but baby steps I've been wearing shoes Jessie has been bringing

[3224.58 → 3228.74] all right back to Linus and Luke talking about crazy stuff going on can you intro our next topic
[3228.74 → 3236.34] yes man everything is a mixer one yeah let's talk through that why don't we Microsoft axes mixer i
[3236.34 → 3245.38] actually said what to my display when I read this i I could not contain it to nobody barely use Twitter
[3245.38 → 3252.58] any more um ever i I'm not super active on social media these days um but I just blew up when this
[3252.58 → 3258.98] happened because it's a like especially being sort of in the space it's its kind of its huge amazing
[3259.46 → 3266.26] it's its massive it's its not that often you see a platform like this just gone um but
[3266.26 → 3275.62] yeah acquired yes gone no like bizarre uh yeah uh oh okay I thought you were saying that was what
[3275.62 → 3281.70] happened no, no no, no I just mean like to be acquired is like normally you expect yeah you know these
[3281.70 → 3287.46] these platforms to just kind of you know oh yeah I'll acquire yahoo acquired it, and you're like what
[3287.46 → 3291.46] does yahoo even own like what does yahoo even do you know like that kind of thing you expect that
[3291.46 → 3296.98] but just gone they acquire things and then let them die yeah exactly this one just died on its
[3296.98 → 3304.58] own though uh all mixer sites and apps will redirect users to Facebook gaming that's crazy um which i
[3304.58 → 3309.62] I think we're going to have to come back to that in a moment during the current controversy holy cow the
[3309.62 → 3314.50] the fact that they decided to do that was nuts uh the company stated in a blog post on June 22nd
[3314.50 → 3320.82] blind siding definitely talk to a few people from that platform definitely blind siding streamers
[3320.82 → 3326.02] employees and their partners the move Microsoft said is in direct reaction to the company's lack
[3326.02 → 3333.14] of success with uh, uh growth in the mixer audience overall on the platform there is if you
[3333.14 → 3340.50] watch like uh shroud or ninja on that platform they will have a lot of viewers the issue is the platform
[3340.50 → 3347.22] as a whole viewership has not really gone up and I really do mean that because it seems like the
[3347.22 → 3353.94] viewers from other streams just went to shroud and ninja yeah it doesn't really seem that more people
[3353.94 → 3358.90] came to mixer don't quote me on this but I was reading an article that said that in the same time
[3358.90 → 3365.38] period mixer grew by like one percent and Facebook gaming had doubled or something like that yeah I mean
[3365.38 → 3370.98] if you click on the blue text that says stats you should be able to scroll down and see year
[3370.98 → 3377.86] over year growth that's a very interesting chart, and it very accurately displays the issue um where
[3377.86 → 3385.14] there was a 0.2 year of a year growth for mixer there we go 38 year of a year growth for Facebook gaming
[3385.14 → 3392.90] 65 for YouTube gaming and almost exactly a hundred percent for twitch there was no there was effectively no
[3392.90 → 3400.66] growth from mixer um, and they had the highest like opportunity to grow um being at a smaller
[3400.66 → 3406.10] number and bringing in these massive streamers, and they didn't see any growth um streamers were locked
[3406.10 → 3413.14] into exclusivity deals with mixer, and they were fully released from their contracts so ninja and shroud
[3413.14 → 3419.78] and I believe others were fully released from their contracts' ninja's deal was estimated at 20 to 30
[3419.78 → 3425.86] million dollars, and he's been fully released from his contract uh Facebook apparently offered them
[3426.42 → 3433.06] wild amounts of money I don't have exact some people were talking about potentially 2x the original
[3433.06 → 3440.98] contract amounts um and neither as far as I know neither shroud nor ninja have publicly stated what
[3440.98 → 3445.38] they are going to be doing moving forward I mean i would for 60 million dollars I would
[3445.38 → 3451.30] definitely be thinking about it at least i i I look you know what you can Facebook very bad
[3451.86 → 3456.66] very, very bad on the record very bad here I am so clearly they're never going to make me an offer
[3456.66 → 3462.50] at this point and then if I keep burning bridges like this but uh man for like 50 million bucks
[3463.30 → 3469.06] uh man i I would at least have to think about it, you know if they offered me 40 million dollars like i
[3469.06 → 3474.74] would definitely I would definitely have to at least talk to the wife you know like if Facebook called up and
[3474.74 → 3480.34] they were like look I'll give you 30 million dollars to stream on Facebook gaming it's its worth it's
[3480.34 → 3486.66] worth considering okay, okay okay hypothetical scenario they offer 20 million dollars I just keep going down
[3488.34 → 3491.06] you have to at least think about it this is set for life money
[3492.66 → 3499.94] 40 million dollars, but you had to cease all activity on all other platforms I wouldn't do it right
[3499.94 → 3507.06] yeah I wouldn't okay, okay let's let's just go let's just say uh flow plane and YouTube because those
[3507.06 → 3511.06] are the other only other because like Twitter and Instagram is not the same level of video
[3512.42 → 3518.98] I have to stop no there's no way I'm a YouTuber like for better or for worse um i kind of i kind of
[3518.98 → 3525.94] live or die by that sword um you know if is YouTube dies that's you know I would probably just I'd
[3525.94 → 3533.70] probably just hang up my screwdriver uh you know like honestly like I think I like the statement i
[3533.70 → 3538.74] i would keep like I would probably keep creating some content, but it would be something
[3538.74 → 3546.18] that I would do as a hobby as opposed to uh my profession I think is very likely right yeah I think
[3546.18 → 3552.02] the things that you found interesting like I could see myself legitimately in like a semi-retirement
[3552.02 → 3555.94] where I'm still on something like float plane and I'm still on Twitter and just like you know
[3555.94 → 3561.54] tweeting random thoughts and I'm still like you know live-streaming just playing video games um
[3562.50 → 3567.86] to like that audience in particular is really fun to engage with uh you know i could see
[3567.86 → 3572.34] myself doing that because it would be justifiable because these are paying these are
[3572.34 → 3579.38] effectively paying customers that want to engage with you and um yeah you know it's its way better
[3579.38 → 3584.42] you know use of time compared to you know ad supported platforms so in that sense like I could
[3584.42 → 3589.62] I could definitely justify taking the time to do something like that but if I was effectively like
[3589.62 → 3596.42] deplatformed like where I do most of my volume business as opposed to like my high profit business
[3596.42 → 3602.50] i just I don't think I'd want to pick up the pieces again it's demoralizing even if I could do it
[3602.50 → 3608.66] and I think I could do it I think I'm an I think I'm a very good you know online personality um I think
[3608.66 → 3612.42] that's fair to say at this point I think if I wanted to make it as a game streamer I could make
[3612.42 → 3620.10] that work or whatever um, but it would just be it would be borderline depressing to have to start over
[3622.02 → 3628.90] yeah i I could definitely see that um I don't know if that's what you're asking that is and I want to
[3628.90 → 3634.90] jump back on that quick I just want to finish the notes here Facebook is offering 2500 signing bonuses
[3634.90 → 3639.54] two mixer partners, and it was much easier to become a mixer partner than it was a twitch partner
[3639.54 → 3646.58] um who they're offering that 2500 if they join uh the Facebook gaming creator program and stay for 90
[3646.58 → 3651.54] days along with fulfilling obligations which is probably like minimum streaming times and days
[3651.54 → 3660.50] etc um now what do you think let's focus on what everybody's focusing on which is ninja and
[3660.50 → 3666.74] shroud what do you think they will do, and you can answer uh individually if you want I think they're
[3666.74 → 3671.70] going to end up going back to twitch I think that they are going to go back to twitch with uh less
[3671.70 → 3677.30] lucrative deals but I think twitch is in a position where again talking about you know deplatforming
[3677.30 → 3682.50] so they deplatformed from you think after getting potentially 30 million dollars
[3684.10 → 3689.70] as a signing bonus than just being able to walk away that ninja is going to in a certain way crawl back to
[3689.70 → 3697.06] twitch and take a worse contract what are his other options he could just quit he could stream
[3697.06 → 3703.22] wherever he wants he could go to YouTube i he is at this point he has spoken out against twitch
[3703.22 → 3710.02] specifically, and they trashed his channel after he left does you remember that that's true no I had
[3710.02 → 3715.70] actually forgotten about that I did know that they weren't going to accept them back with open arms I do
[3715.70 → 3724.42] know that yeah like ninja had to specifically call out twitch for abusing his channel um and there
[3724.42 → 3733.06] was uh there was some very odd content posted on his stream I don't remember exactly what it was
[3733.70 → 3740.50] um but they posted stuff on his page that he was very not okay with um
[3740.50 → 3744.82] YouTube chats like only fans
[3748.66 → 3754.82] oh man you know what is the man what is the answer because nothing beats the discoverability
[3754.82 → 3759.46] well okay they have terrible discoverability but once you're big nothing beats the discoverability of
[3759.46 → 3764.26] twitch if you're a game streamer period um if you don't want to get in bed with Facebook which I could
[3764.26 → 3771.30] understand not wanting to do you can't go there YouTube gaming like so shroud yeah honestly i
[3771.30 → 3777.70] wouldn't be too surprised if he went back to twitch uh I feel like his cut from twitch was much cleaner
[3780.18 → 3787.06] yeah for sure um and I don't remember much public at least major fighting between them ninja's
[3787.06 → 3802.10] um the twitch as a whole streamed some stuff on his page that he was extremely not okay with I don't
[3802.10 → 3809.06] want to say the word for what it was because it might uh flag this video um but like and he
[3809.06 → 3816.02] he posted a whole video uh essentially if we want to use like civilization terms uh he denounced
[3816.58 → 3820.02] twitch in a certain way like we've been playing sim lately
[3821.86 → 3827.94] um moving down to why do they keep denouncing me they just have more I just have more great people than
[3827.94 → 3837.14] them um but uh I guess in this situation actually um but yeah i I think it would be a very interesting
[3837.14 → 3842.90] move if he went back to twitch and I think it would definitely take some explanation due to the
[3842.90 → 3848.66] fighting that has happened in the past um and I think it would take both sides kind of coming together
[3848.66 → 3853.86] and trying to wipe the slate clean I do not think it would just be ninja crawling back I think it would
[3853.86 → 3860.74] be both sides trying to uh split their differences and try to move forward if he goes back to twitch i
[3860.74 → 3867.06] honestly wouldn't be too surprised if he maybe went to YouTube my reasoning for that is Facebook
[3867.06 → 3871.30] super controversial right now yeah I would be very surprised if either of them went to Facebook
[3871.78 → 3879.86] um twitch for ninja is rather controversial right now I wouldn't be stunned but I'd be a little bit
[3879.86 → 3886.82] surprised if is they made that work again but YouTube is kind of this neutral zone um it also doesn't go
[3886.82 → 3891.14] in line with the statements he was making when he first moved to mixer which is that he could maybe
[3891.14 → 3896.58] uh help guide and direct the direction there and have a bigger voice yeah having a bigger voice I think
[3896.58 → 3901.30] you'll have no voice at YouTube basically yeah they don't really seem to care I was actually
[3901.94 → 3906.66] decently surprised that the YouTube gaming numbers were as high as they were on that stats page
[3907.30 → 3912.34] I even killed the dedicated app last year it killed the dedicated app and when's the last time they said
[3912.34 → 3918.18] anything about YouTube gaming they're just lucky I guess and just it just carries from the YouTube
[3918.18 → 3925.30] name as a whole so yes and no I mean there 's's no luck to how good YouTube is at live video
[3925.30 → 3932.50] delivery and Maude video delivery like good engineering at some point is valuable yeah the dashboard is horrible
[3932.98 → 3939.70] um the actual usability of YouTube live is terrible um I mean I know how to use it now it's okay
[3941.62 → 3945.06] yeah, but it's not a good selling intuitive miss and
[3946.58 → 3952.58] ease of use is probably close to worth and worst in the industry um I'm sure they'll figure it out because
[3952.58 → 3957.70] they're YouTube but right now it's very bad so like i I just losing his voice almost completely
[3957.70 → 3962.02] all these other things would be a surprising I don't know everything from him, I think is just
[3962.02 → 3966.98] going to be a surprising move because like the YouTube move is so against the reason why he went to
[3966.98 → 3975.54] mixer yeah and the twitch move is so against everything as far as I know that he said about twitch since he
[3975.54 → 3984.42] left so you know what I mean you know 20 or 30 million or let's say it's even just 10 million
[3984.42 → 3989.78] dollars that really is set for life money um maybe they just stream as a hobby, and it actually doesn't
[3989.78 → 3994.02] really matter where they go you know what I'm I'm here okay fine with all the extra information
[3994.02 → 3999.78] you've given me you've made it easier I think uh I think ninja stays on YouTube I think shroud makes a
[3999.78 → 4006.58] triumphant return back to twitch there because I mean ninja's got like 20 million subscribers on
[4006.58 → 4011.94] YouTube it's not like he's like starting over there he's huge on YouTube yeah he would do super
[4011.94 → 4019.86] well he always had massive Fortnite clips yeah um he would do super well on YouTube for sure and he was
[4019.86 → 4027.30] one of the twitch people who always talked about their YouTube audience as well and like YouTube felt
[4027.30 → 4035.62] like a side thing sure in the story instead of an uh weird underlying platform like it
[4035.62 → 4040.10] was it was a platform that he definitely cared a lot about I'm going to say neither of them gets a
[4040.10 → 4047.38] sweetheart deal to go anywhere though at this point uh except for Facebook but well apparently they've
[4047.38 → 4055.94] both publicly turned it down yeah so, but they still got the deal well yeah yeah uh what who knows if it's
[4055.94 → 4060.82] him or not but uh whoever manages his YouTube channel has uploaded a video there as recently as
[4060.82 → 4066.10] seven hours ago yep and that wasn't like oh Geez we have to keep this going there's there are videos
[4066.10 → 4076.26] going up there all the time they could come to float plane just saying we've uh I had someone in chat
[4076.26 → 4083.78] actually ask uh this is a super chat uh over on YouTube could float plane support um those kinds of
[4083.78 → 4092.58] viewers um the answer is yes but with a big asterisk so right now the way it's architected we could
[4092.58 → 4098.98] support a nearly unlimited number of concurrent viewers but not a nearly unlimited number of
[4098.98 → 4106.66] concurrent streamers so if like one of them on top of that as well but yeah yeah if is one of them
[4106.66 → 4112.90] showed up we could probably make it work just like you know all three of these guys knocked on our door
[4112.90 → 4119.14] and we're like hey we'd have to we'd have to real quick fast duct tape engineer some stuff and it
[4119.14 → 4123.70] might not be smooth probably wouldn't go that well probably we could try though probably wouldn't be
[4123.70 → 4129.54] smooth well we could like we'll give it a baseball try we could manually no, no hold on a second hold on
[4129.54 → 4134.34] I got an idea I got to work around Luke we just manually fully duplicate the entire streaming
[4134.34 → 4140.90] infrastructure we have now for each of them beautiful okay tell me it wouldn't work tell me it wouldn't work
[4140.90 → 4151.30] I mean yeah go on I think AJ would have to like to take the second half of the year off and do all
[4151.30 → 4157.38] the rest of his hours in the next four weeks but tell me it wouldn't work if you could, I mean you could
[4157.38 → 4164.50] do it hey there it is there let's get it done yeah we've done most of our work on Vaud at this point um
[4164.50 → 4172.50] yeah all right uh okay do we have any other big topics I feel like we still do is there anything oh
[4172.50 → 4179.22] my goodness Microsoft to permanently close all physical retail stores uh yeah apparently this was
[4179.22 → 4186.10] not uh pandemic related or at least not pandemic hinged like it wasn't purely done because of the
[4186.10 → 4197.06] pandemic um retail is dying I think at the same yeah retail is dying and I've walked past many a
[4197.06 → 4203.46] Microsoft store and seen them completely empty um but I think Microsoft is having a little bit of
[4203.46 → 4209.22] trouble like honestly outside Xbox they are a little bit newer to the hardware space
[4209.22 → 4217.30] yes they're not brand new, but they're a new player they needed more they need more actual
[4217.30 → 4221.62] Microsoft products to make it worth it to go in their store and experience them and experience
[4221.62 → 4227.94] them working together that's why apple is successful because in order to you know part of experiencing an
[4227.94 → 4231.94] apple product is experiencing how it works with apple's other products whereas I don't think Microsoft
[4231.94 → 4237.38] really has that story in a compelling way outside Xbox and even that is basically in its infancy as far
[4237.38 → 4241.46] as I can tell like they're really still like if is part of the experience of going to a Microsoft
[4241.46 → 4249.14] store was gaming with my friend on a pc and me being on an Xbox that'd be like super cool I'd be
[4249.14 → 4252.50] like yeah that's something that you that's an experience that you would have to go to a store
[4252.50 → 4259.14] in order to have and fully appreciate um but when Microsoft started just like filling up
[4259.14 → 4263.06] these stores with like partner notebook skews and stuff like that I was like what are you guys even
[4263.06 → 4268.74] doing like there's no money in reselling notebooks and I'm not that's not to say that there is zero
[4268.74 → 4273.70] money in it there's just not enough to support all that retail overhead and Microsoft's not the kind of
[4273.70 → 4281.06] company that can afford the risk of having poorly trained people in their stores that you know create
[4281.06 → 4287.14] some kind of racist hullabaloo or whatever the case may be like you just can't afford it so they
[4287.14 → 4291.94] have to have expensive and thorough training programs and all that stuff and this there's just so much
[4291.94 → 4299.78] overhead involved, so this doesn't surprise me uh see I have seen a lot of them so I thought they were
[4299.78 → 4309.54] more common uh but apparently seven of them uh are in British Columbia Alberta and Ontario so maybe
[4309.54 → 4316.10] that's why I think that, but they only had 83 stores worldwide which is a lot less than I thought 72 of
[4316.10 → 4325.06] them were in U.S. wow yeah so they were basically all North American yep, so this was they have one in
[4325.06 → 4331.06] the Taiwan tech mall is that like the other one I'm not sure I thought like racer had a store there
[4331.06 → 4336.98] or something I think they only have four outside of that so like yeah i I don't know online's the way to
[4336.98 → 4341.38] go, and they've got some cool new features coming to their online storefronts including one-to-one video
[4341.38 → 4348.98] chat that's pretty cool online tutorials virtual workshops and more digital solutions that make
[4348.98 → 4354.18] so much more sense because it's like I remember someone talking to me about why I don't do more
[4354.18 → 4360.66] in-person uh fan engagement and the cold hard truth is that it's not great use of my time not
[4360.66 → 4366.90] because I don't enjoy it I really do and that's why we do Ltd or at least we normally do uh because i
[4366.90 → 4374.66] love if it's a blast the problem is that if I have two hours to do something I can either tweet
[4374.66 → 4381.46] like hey anyone want to meet up at the Starbucks and I can engage with three people or I can sit
[4381.46 → 4386.18] down in front of my computer and live stream and engage with a thousand people or ten thousand people
[4386.18 → 4391.30] or a hundred thousand people uh so you know what's a better return on the investment of my time at
[4391.30 → 4396.82] that point online I don't think your civ streams get a hundred thousand people bro they get a thousand
[4396.82 → 4398.58] and that was one of the numbers i said
[4403.78 → 4409.54] if I make a video I can reach a hundred thousand people like that so there you go smart guy true
[4409.54 → 4414.34] yeah one cool thing actually in hearing the part about like the one-to-one video chat
[4414.34 → 4421.46] yeah online tutorials virtual workshops and stuff like that is there's no information yet about layoffs
[4421.46 → 4428.66] I would find it extremely difficult for them to keep everyone related to all 83 stores employed in
[4428.66 → 4434.26] those ways, but they might be able to flip some of them and be able to retain any of these people during
[4435.06 → 4440.90] a pandemic is perfect news for those people yeah and being able to transition those people to
[4440.90 → 4445.46] potentially working from home is also kind of a cool idea um some of the Microsoft stores will
[4445.46 → 4451.54] apparently be reimagined as Microsoft experience centres in London New York city Sydney and Redmond
[4452.18 → 4456.98] that might even be a better idea oh man there's like so much news this week we didn't even talk
[4456.98 → 4461.46] about this yet uh NVIDIA releases the first driver with direct x12 ultimate support and hardware
[4461.46 → 4465.78] accelerated GPU scheduling also there's a Windows update that shows your GPU temps right in task
[4465.78 → 4472.42] manager that's so cool um so this is perfect news for RTX card owners making RTX variable rate shading
[4472.42 → 4476.98] and mesh shading easier for developers to implement that's great they also support hardware accelerated
[4476.98 → 4481.94] GPU scheduling which allows the GPU to directly manage VRAM sweet Microsoft says this lowers latency
[4481.94 → 4488.74] and can lead to higher minimum fps numbers love it and there was just one more thing that I wanted to
[4488.74 → 4492.98] wow we didn't even talk about the whole apple arm thing, but that's okay I did a dedicated video
[4492.98 → 4495.70] about that reaching a million people by the way Luke um
[4495.70 → 4504.18] uh wait no I guess that's it was it just like a super chat thing that I had wanted to talk about
[4504.18 → 4512.18] uh steam summer sale uh steam summer sale rip your wallet civ6 is 15 bucks um oh you have to be you have to
[4512.18 → 4521.22] be kidding me I just paid 80 Canadian dollars for it uh you may be able to uh ask for a refund and uh
[4521.22 → 4525.94] uh they will basically give you the difference between the discounted price yeah it's called price
[4525.94 → 4531.06] protection yeah i can apply for price protection I made I may just do that because
[4531.06 → 4538.10] that's a lot of money anyway there are also a bunch of other interesting discounts it's the steam summer
[4538.10 → 4541.94] sale almost every discount is going to be the same as almost every other steam sale, but there is some
[4541.94 → 4547.14] cool stuff in there man there's even super chats about how doomed retail is Macy's is apparently cutting
[4547.14 → 4554.02] staff I just saw on the news a couple of days ago GNC filing for bankruptcy and closing 1200 stores
[4554.02 → 4560.98] so that's like one of those like supplement vitamin places chuck e cheese no bankruptcy yeah chuck e cheese
[4561.62 → 4562.66] not chuck e cheese
[4565.30 → 4569.14] chuck e cheese parent company closed 34 locations permanently whoa
[4569.14 → 4574.82] it's it I went there a little while ago the one in Langley it was pretty bad
[4576.34 → 4582.26] it's like they haven't really done anything they had that story about reusing pizza and stuff too yeah
[4584.42 → 4590.18] yeah crash crawlies for life actually their food's pretty bad too
[4593.70 → 4598.98] uh anyway sorry back to super chats here um pro yogurt says how do you think
[4598.98 → 4606.18] the PS5 SSD will compare to octane um I mean it's just it's such an apples to oranges comparison
[4606.18 → 4616.10] octane is all about low latency and the PS5 SSD is all about uh architecting um the whole system so that
[4616.82 → 4622.74] games have direct access to the data on it so it's just like it's just not the same thing at all
[4623.46 → 4628.98] so to speak uh aj35 lightning says would you consider daily in the new Peria one actually yeah
[4629.54 → 4635.78] I would definitely consider it because the one thing my note 9 does not do well these days compared to
[4635.78 → 4638.74] uh newer phones is the camera is falling behind a little bit
[4641.78 → 4642.02] uh
[4646.26 → 4652.66] core Maximus says after 90 90 days after purchase Netgear charges a hundred dollars for phone support to file an
[4652.66 → 4656.18] RMA really wish I didn't buy a nighthawk after seeing your sponsored vid I'm really sorry to
[4656.18 → 4662.98] hear that is there a reason you didn't file a RMA online though you got to understand I mean I'm not
[4662.98 → 4668.66] saying this is right that's horrible, and they shouldn't do that but Netgear is more of like a b2b um
[4668.66 → 4675.46] slash uh yeah business to business company and so it's pretty normal for you to have paid phone support
[4675.46 → 4679.94] after a very short period of time for those types of products and I think this is one of those cases where
[4679.94 → 4683.70] they just don't really fully understand that when you're selling to consumers you like actually
[4683.70 → 4689.54] can't do that um so yeah raise a stink complain uh try and get a refund, but it doesn't surprise me
[4689.54 → 4694.18] that much, but that also doesn't mean that it's necessarily a bad product I'm sorry yours was uh DOA
[4694.18 → 4701.06] though uh ludo says I'm already paying on float plane hi from Quebec you inspired me to work in it
[4701.06 → 4705.70] and leave the field because I liked it better as a hobby LMAO you know I don't even blame you
[4705.70 → 4715.22] don't even blame you yeah what else we got here uh Muhammad says since ten dollars thanks for the
[4715.22 → 4719.14] free bottle replacement after the paint job faded it's not free anymore if you send a ten dollar
[4719.14 → 4727.06] super chat dude uh general disregard says uh gotta keep the personal protective wait no ppt what's ppt
[4727.06 → 4736.18] performance on point ppt what is ppt performance Luke help me out performance product technology
[4737.14 → 4740.34] oh PowerPoint oh that's probably when we're talking about the intel thing all right fair enough
[4741.46 → 4746.66] oh what else we got in the intel slides it compared to 3400g with integrated graphics versus an i3 with a
[4746.66 → 4752.10] dedicated GPU I actually didn't even notice that I'd have to look closer at them to validate that but
[4752.10 → 4760.10] uh all right thanks Christian Johnson um let me have a look is there anything else uh josh asks
[4760.10 → 4765.30] how can float plane succeed when mixer and Microsoft cannot yes it's different, but float plane was just
[4765.30 → 4772.18] included in the same category let's hear it well float plane for better or for worse hasn't really
[4772.18 → 4781.30] found its um its calling yet I mean I think if Luke and I had said two years ago uh you know what let's
[4781.30 → 4787.94] do an only fans type concept uh float plane could absolutely be a gigantic platform today it's not
[4787.94 → 4794.66] a deficiency of the actual video delivery technology it's just a matter of us figuring out sort of what
[4794.66 → 4800.34] the identity needs to be because I think the earlier vision was that creators would just kind of decide
[4800.34 → 4809.14] what the identity was, but that seems to have kind of uh made our messaging unclear we still have
[4809.14 → 4813.94] work to do on the site anyway and the thing about float plane is that massive shout out by the way to
[4813.94 → 4820.10] our float plane pilots and all the people who follow slash subscribe slash whatever we call it um on
[4820.10 → 4826.50] float plane to Linus media group and to the other creators we have on their like nitwit tech deals uh UFD
[4827.14 → 4833.78] forgotten weapons is one that's actually been crushing it on the platform lately uh he's uploaded
[4833.78 → 4841.30] he's uploaded look at this he's uploaded 10 videos in the last week and just like killing it there i
[4841.30 → 4846.98] already watched a lot of his content but now I watched like a lot of his content really cool
[4846.98 → 4855.86] stuff really cool stuff um a fun one about that I don't I don't know worse AK ever I'm going to go into it
[4855.86 → 4863.06] anyway but um a fun one about that is that I can watch his content with my grandpa right and
[4863.06 → 4869.06] my grandpa super into that yeah, and he'll, he'll like to add in his own like experience or knowledge of
[4869.06 → 4873.62] of those firearms and whatever else as well and that's fascinating too so that it is it's
[4873.62 → 4878.26] made this like cool loop where I just like email my grandpa videos from him and go like oh I thought
[4878.26 → 4882.02] this one was cool because of these reasons and where your grandpa actually understands what you do for
[4882.02 → 4887.54] a living even though you're like a developer it's pretty much the only thing that's been able to like
[4888.42 → 4894.34] bring us together in that way it's been kind of cool that is very cool because I remember your grandpa
[4894.34 → 4900.98] was not super approving of like our shenanigans in the early days with a knife at one point that was
[4900.98 → 4908.82] very awkward yeah that was really not great he also when I made the uh I don't know if the
[4908.82 → 4914.74] the audience knows this but when I made the fallout bomb video um he took that a little seriously
[4914.74 → 4921.06] instead of just like that I built a computer inside a thing a prop from a video game
[4921.06 → 4925.22] because the authorities might come for you and stuff and I'm like it's okay it's okay it's okay grams
[4925.22 → 4932.50] they're a little bit more calm about internet stuff these days yeah I'm sorry yep um so yeah because
[4932.50 → 4938.42] of the supporters that we have over there now we can take our time uh we don't have to worry about like oh
[4938.42 → 4943.70] you know we're losing money well we gotta sell this thing or we have to you know go raise a
[4943.70 → 4947.78] bunch of venture capital from people who are going to pressure us to sell it or pressure us to
[4947.78 → 4952.18] change it in ways that we don't agree with or whatever the case may be um we can take our time
[4952.18 → 4958.66] we can figure out what it is um you know I'll, I'll say it outright like I would not be against bringing
[4958.66 → 4966.02] on a controversial figure like dr disrespect or I would not be against what happened first yeah I guess
[4966.02 → 4971.94] I wouldn't mind knowing what happened but in general we are not looking to shy away from
[4971.94 → 4977.14] controversial figures and I don't even think we would shy away from someone who's posting explicit
[4977.14 → 4982.58] stuff either like it's it doesn't really have an identity and that was sort of intentional um but
[4982.58 → 4987.78] we'll see whether we decide to change that in the future and kind of rebranded in some way or
[4987.78 → 4992.98] whether we decide to leave it the way that it is right yeah so that's my long answer to that question
[4992.98 → 5000.50] um Eric Jackson says can I get a shout-out for adored TV he was even on one of those video card
[5000.50 → 5006.58] slides there it is shout out to adored TV right there yeah and I think that's pretty much it for
[5006.58 → 5012.74] the show thank you guys very much for tuning in wow ton of you watching today holy smokes over 3 000 on
[5012.74 → 5018.66] twitch over 13 000 on YouTube and then I still don't have a live viewer counter on float plane Luke
[5018.66 → 5026.58] I'm sure you're working on that uh so however many people are playing yeah however many actually a lot
[5026.58 → 5030.90] more than we used to have I can just tell by all the chat activity, so thanks for tuning in guys we'll
[5030.90 → 5038.82] see you again next week same bad time same bat channel bye
