[0.00 --> 8.82]  and we are live welcome ladies and gentlemen to the one the only WAN show actually there's
[8.82 --> 14.28]  hundreds of them at this point but that's a minor minor detail hundreds of WAN shows this one is
[14.28 --> 19.14]  going to be unique though it'll be different from all the other ones in that this is the first time
[19.14 --> 26.22]  ever here on the WAN show that I and James have co-hosted it from remote locations together now
[26.22 --> 32.28]  I have co-hosted with James before and I have co-hosted remotely with someone other than James
[32.28 --> 37.14]  before but this combination this is brand new so get ready for something that's unlike anything
[37.14 --> 42.24]  you've ever seen before James do I have you amped for the show like is that do you feel good do you
[42.24 --> 49.62]  want to listen to the rest of it do you believe in life after Luke everyone's gonna be singing that
[49.62 --> 54.60]  all weekend now you're welcome oh Lordy we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today
[54.60 --> 61.62]  this one is my personal favorite I was reading an article on the verge yesterday and I was halfway
[61.62 --> 68.10]  through it and I realized why was this ever a thing Facebook has apparently killed their pseudo
[68.10 --> 74.52]  science ad category so I thought that one was pretty good what what do you got James what's your top topic
[74.52 --> 79.72]  well there's something similar from YouTube where apparently they're going to be just removing videos
[79.72 --> 86.74]  that contain medically unsubstantiated content and we also man we have to talk about RTX voice it's so sick
[86.74 --> 93.76]  it is really cool except for one small rub don't spoil it oh oh don't spoil it okay all right I won't
[93.76 --> 100.54]  spoil it but there's something that you might not know about RTX voice that was my hint it was just a hint
[100.54 --> 106.26]  it wasn't entirely spoiled right we still good that was subtle that was subtle all right all right no I got
[106.26 --> 111.40]  one more it's four it's four James you got to do four topics each host presents two topics okay these
[111.40 --> 119.44]  are informal rules and we do deviate from them from time to time AMD AMD has announced their third gen
[119.44 --> 127.06]  Ryzen 3 processors and b550 chipset and I'm real excited about those as well we actually this is one
[127.06 --> 130.70]  of those weeks where I say we've got a lot of great topics for you guys and we actually have a lot of
[130.70 --> 139.86]  great topics for you let's roll that intro oh of course I forgot to set it public on YouTube
[139.86 --> 148.48]  figures that's fine it's public now it doesn't matter how do I see you instead of me uh I don't know get
[148.48 --> 148.76]  good
[148.76 --> 160.68]  the show is brought to you today by plural site and vessi footwear yeah that's right
[160.68 --> 169.12]  that footwear you wear it on your foot foot here foot here foot oh I love it all right so guys I
[169.12 --> 173.86]  want to jump right into the headline topic today I actually don't I want to talk about the pseudoscience
[173.86 --> 179.84]  category but the AMD Ryzen 3 announcement is the one that I put in the title and thumbnail so we're
[179.84 --> 184.82]  going to go with that one the original article here is well basically everywhere uh tech spot posted
[184.82 --> 190.22]  about it extreme tech posted about it AMD has announced you know I I was starting to think they weren't
[190.22 --> 198.04]  going to do it Zen 2 launched with Ryzen 5 Ryzen 7 Ryzen 9 and I had thought for quite a while there
[198.04 --> 203.40]  that AMD was just going to round out the low end of their product lineup with last gen products they
[203.40 --> 209.58]  were just going to let it be okay look hey you don't have enough for uh for a Ryzen 5 uh third gen well
[209.58 --> 216.22]  then that's fine why don't you just buy a uh you know Ryzen Ryzen 5 you know second gen or something
[216.22 --> 223.60]  along those lines um and so oh hold on a second uh okay I can fix that for you at some point James
[223.60 --> 228.06]  but it's a lower priority right now I want to I want to get through this topic um so yeah I I thought
[228.06 --> 233.44]  they were just going to do that nope it turns out they have decided to take the same thumb screws
[233.44 --> 240.26]  that they took to AMD uh to Intel's Core i7s Core i5s Core i9s and they are applying them to Intel's
[240.26 --> 248.58]  Core i3s so the Ryzen 3 3100 and 3300x these are entry level chips both of them are going to be
[248.58 --> 255.36]  quad cores with SMT so that means four cores eight threads and 18 megs of total cache both of them
[255.36 --> 264.22]  get this are coming with support for PCI Express Gen 4 so for a total price of an entry level oh I
[264.22 --> 270.24]  haven't even gotten into the motherboard yet but for let's just say this for a couple hundred dollars
[270.24 --> 276.44]  you are going to be able to get a chip and board that is quad core PCIe Gen 4 and that is coming in
[276.44 --> 284.04]  the next little bit here so the the Ryzen 3 3100 segment is safe Intel no no the 3100 is 3.6 gigahertz
[284.04 --> 291.52]  base 3.9 boost that thing is going to game it's going to game for 99 dollars a hundred bucks and that'll
[291.52 --> 301.30]  be positioned against the Core i3 9100 f so uh 9100 pay respects edition uh and the Ryzen 3 30 300x that's
[301.30 --> 309.76]  going to be 0.2 gigahertz higher base so 3.8 base 4.3 boost that thing is going to really game like you
[309.76 --> 317.98]  are going to be able to pair that with something like an RTX 2060 um excuse me RTX 2060 super and really
[317.98 --> 321.72]  get the performance that you're expecting out of that graphics card as long as you're not playing
[321.72 --> 327.28]  a game that is particularly CPU demanding like there are some games out there that demand a lot
[327.28 --> 334.12]  of threads even the most don't this is like the like the um the ultimate fortnight christmas cpu for
[334.12 --> 340.42]  your kid or yourself yeah basically you know and not even just fortnight like that's the crazy thing
[340.42 --> 346.24]  like if you want to play the latest cod game uh if you want to play oh yeah so james i don't know my uh
[346.24 --> 353.72]  my camera should be working for you i actually don't know why that isn't working so uh oh yeah
[353.72 --> 358.12]  well i don't know yep hopefully hopefully that's working can you say something i actually think your
[358.12 --> 363.26]  audio might have cut out when i was changing things i'm james am i still here oh yeah you're still there
[363.26 --> 370.20]  all right cool oh and you broke up a little bit but that's okay all right so let's uh let's have a
[370.20 --> 375.32]  look at if there's anything else for us to really share okay so one area where amd is actually going to
[375.32 --> 383.18]  fall a little bit behind on specs here is the core i5 9400f which they're positioning the 3300x against
[383.18 --> 391.82]  is a six core so there may be workloads where intel is going to uh come out ahead with that processor but
[391.82 --> 399.64]  i mean intel's stronghold lately has been gaming and if the 3300x performs anywhere near what i would
[399.64 --> 404.38]  expect i think it's going to absolutely crush the 9400f when it comes to low-end gaming
[404.38 --> 412.92]  um with that said um oh oh and this is interesting okay so we don't actually know for sure what the
[412.92 --> 419.62]  ccx arrangements of these chips are so ccx's for those who are not familiar are the multiple um like
[419.62 --> 427.16]  kind of chiplets that amd puts together to make a processor and depending on how many chiplets you have
[427.16 --> 432.20]  and how they're interconnected there can be latency disadvantages or advantages depending on the
[432.20 --> 440.74]  layout so the rumor is that the 3100 is going to be cheaper because it's a multiple ccx design whereas
[440.74 --> 448.66]  the 3300x could be a single ccx which could make it fantastic for gaming man this is like this is like
[448.66 --> 455.84]  going back to like the the you know athlon 2500 plus days right like when you could buy a processor
[455.84 --> 461.82]  remember this is 99 retail price so at some point in its life cycle it's going to go on sale for you
[461.82 --> 467.92]  know like 90 bucks in a bundle when you could buy a gaming cpu for under a hundred dollars like that's
[467.92 --> 476.26]  madness it's exciting it kind of reminds me um i was having a discussion with david during a carpool
[476.26 --> 482.78]  the other day we were trying to figure out whether or not um how the next wave of consoles is they're
[482.78 --> 490.16]  more like pcs yeah that make pc components cheaper or more expensive i argued more expensive but he
[490.16 --> 495.90]  thought maybe it would push the prices down because it would commoditize everything i don't think there's
[495.90 --> 502.52]  really a ton of room for the prices to go down a bunch i will okay competition's already high enough
[502.52 --> 506.80]  it's already a race to the bottom so just the fact that these components will be used up by the
[506.80 --> 511.56]  console market will just make them more scarce yeah i well i don't think it's going to affect that
[511.56 --> 518.48]  either so okay so there's a few factors here so one is there is the components of a pc that cannot get
[518.48 --> 524.14]  cheaper um things like hard drives they're not going to get cheaper you know you can these are these
[524.14 --> 528.70]  are all gigantic companies you know whether it's seagate or western digital that we're talking about
[528.70 --> 532.88]  these are huge companies they're publicly traded companies we can look at their balance sheets we
[532.88 --> 538.80]  can see what their profit margins are hard drives not getting cheaper there's just a basic fixed cost
[538.80 --> 545.28]  associated with these uh these rare earth materials that need to be integrated into a hard drive to make
[545.28 --> 551.40]  a functioning hard drive no matter what the the capacity is um there's you you need a motor okay you
[551.40 --> 555.70]  got to put a motor in there you got to fill it with helium now you know for especially for the high
[555.70 --> 561.92]  cap stuff so there's enough competition that i just don't think it's uh it's going anywhere and
[561.92 --> 567.64]  hard drives are under siege not just from alternate hard drive vendors um of which there are few enough
[567.64 --> 572.66]  now that it would be pretty easy for them to just kind of go okay let's just switch up the business
[572.66 --> 576.56]  we're going to go cartel style and we're going to price fix and make sure that we can make some margin
[576.56 --> 581.68]  but they're also under siege from solid state drive makers who continue to push prices lower and lower and
[581.68 --> 587.00]  lower so yeah hard drives not happening solid state drives for that matter it's not it's not getting
[587.00 --> 594.34]  cheaper it's already pretty much a commodity item at this point however there are areas where there is
[594.34 --> 601.04]  room for things to get cheaper i mean for an unrelated video i was actually looking at intel's gross margins
[601.04 --> 607.34]  earlier this week and they're somewhere in the neighborhood of like 60 plus percent so if you look at it
[607.34 --> 615.26]  and go okay could an intel core i5 you know whatever 250 or so processor all of a sudden be available for
[615.26 --> 620.78]  200 bucks yeah that's conceivable i doubt that they would go that aggressive especially because
[620.78 --> 627.26]  just because intel's margins overall are 60 plus percent doesn't mean that they're actually making 60
[627.26 --> 633.38]  plus percent on that product that's in the grand scheme of intel's product stack that's a low-end product
[633.38 --> 640.02]  and that's not where they're making the margin is that margin uh unique to intel in the industry or
[640.02 --> 645.96]  no is that what you expect to see yeah because in that industry they have such heavy upfront capital
[645.96 --> 651.22]  expenditures for building these fabs and for researching the next generation of technology
[651.22 --> 655.92]  that they're going to launch subsequently like way down the road so i think it's a little misleading
[655.92 --> 662.56]  where there is room for your pc to get a little bit cheaper i would say is in your gpu uh nvidia
[662.56 --> 670.32]  also enjoys these healthy you know 60 plus percent gross margins except that all the nvidia does by
[670.32 --> 675.92]  comparison to at least i mean i'm not saying nvidia doesn't invest in rnd they absolutely do but they
[675.92 --> 682.80]  don't build fabs so nvidia gets to take advantage of tsmc's fab building process and they just have to
[682.80 --> 691.28]  design the chip and make it work on tsmc's node so um i think nvidia could probably you know drop
[691.28 --> 696.40]  their price if they felt like the next gen consoles were you know taking a chunk out of their business
[696.40 --> 701.28]  and they could because they're all going to be powered by amd there's going to be no nvidia gpus
[701.28 --> 706.40]  and oh actually okay i don't know it's possible that like a nintendo successor could be nvidia powered
[706.40 --> 712.48]  the current one is i forgot about that is anyone talking about that uh yeah people have talked about it
[712.48 --> 719.36]  yeah how how both microsoft and sony are amd camps and then nintendo sort of randomly went nvidia this
[719.36 --> 725.12]  time around uh just because they wanted that uh well basically i mean the switch just is a an nvidia
[725.12 --> 732.88]  shield tablet like if you i mean obviously a better one a heavily modified one an improved one but you
[732.88 --> 738.72]  know it basically takes that concept of a tablet that you can game with on the go and then dock when you
[738.72 --> 746.56]  want a game on your tv and it's like yoink that's mine now i'm gonna steal this meme you know um
[747.68 --> 754.64]  so yeah there is room for your pc to get cheaper but i don't expect the upcoming consoles to really put
[755.28 --> 761.76]  much in the way of of pressure on that um you know it's they're gonna occupy the low end of the
[761.76 --> 768.64]  market you know anywhere from 400 to 500 where generally speaking manufacturers are already
[768.64 --> 773.28]  taking as little profit as they can in order to uh just do the volume of business that they need to
[773.28 --> 779.12]  do i mean that's something a lot of consumers don't really understand is that manufacturers in
[779.12 --> 786.24]  order to even uh you know meet the production quotas that they've had to commit to in order to build
[786.24 --> 791.92]  their high-end profitable products will sometimes have to pump out low-end products that they don't
[791.92 --> 797.44]  make any money on or that they even lose money on so that they don't lose their contracts for example
[797.44 --> 803.12]  or so that they don't have to lay off the staff that they need to make those those juicy products or to
[803.12 --> 807.20]  justify the lease that they have on this giant building or whatever the case may be there is an
[807.20 --> 813.84]  incentive for manufacturers to keep up their volumes i mean there's other there's other factors that are
[813.84 --> 818.96]  just financial too uh sometimes companies for whatever reason i've never really subscribed to
[818.96 --> 824.16]  this and i remember getting in arguments at my old job for some reason companies feel the need to
[824.72 --> 833.36]  like measure based on how how high their top line revenue is and that seems to determine the like you
[833.36 --> 838.32]  know the the valuation of this company to lenders for example like oh we're a billion dollar company
[838.32 --> 843.04]  it's like oh well what was your what was your net profit i don't know like you know who cares we're a
[843.04 --> 850.08]  billion dollar company right well well no hold on you know to me you know net profit was always
[850.08 --> 854.88]  far more important than what kind of top line revenue we're doing but but that is a factor in some
[854.88 --> 859.76]  corporate cultures i remember at my old job uh we would get we would get pushed the product management
[859.76 --> 864.88]  team would get pushed to hit these crazy you know revenue goals like oh everyone's gonna get a bonus
[864.88 --> 870.24]  if we do a million dollars revenue in one day and we'd look at that and we'd go well like yeah i can do
[870.24 --> 875.12]  a million dollars revenue in one day all i need to do is sell extreme editions for 500 bucks and we'll
[875.12 --> 881.36]  get there just like lickety split right i'll lose a bunch of money like no one's gonna get paid but we
[881.36 --> 885.92]  can do a million dollars revenue in one day if that makes you feel like you're bigger right so well i
[885.92 --> 890.00]  think there's there's also pressure especially when you're a publicly traded company to keep that stock
[890.00 --> 894.56]  price high because that's how you secure additional financing and everyone who's giving you funds
[895.20 --> 898.56]  they're doing in exchange for shares so they want those shares to be worth a lot so
[900.00 --> 906.24]  exactly more important it's yet another way that modern businesses seem to get incentivized to do
[906.24 --> 913.52]  the wrong things in the name of making the business better um and that can that can harm them the long
[913.52 --> 918.00]  term i was reading a really interesting article about rolex of all things i'm not a watch guy i'm not
[918.00 --> 925.52]  into watches but um it was it was an article that was about how rolex continues to innovate and again
[925.52 --> 932.48]  as not a watch guy i kind of look at at a watch and i go sorry innovate what it either it either knows
[932.48 --> 937.52]  what time it is or it doesn't and i i thought we pretty much nailed that down a couple hundred years
[937.52 --> 944.56]  ago so what exactly is the remaining innovation and so it you know talked about you know what that
[944.56 --> 948.64]  innovation might actually mean which was very helpful background information for somebody like
[948.64 --> 954.72]  me reading the article but it talked about how the way that rolex was originally structured their
[954.72 --> 963.12]  corporate structure was designed so that it would it could basically continue perpetually without
[963.12 --> 972.56]  ever being beholden to any kind of shareholders um and so all their revenue numbers sales figures
[972.56 --> 981.84]  um design nobody knows anything about the internal workings of rolex effectively and that's allowed
[981.84 --> 987.04]  them and they're not accountable to anyone so by not having to do a quarterly earnings call or any of that
[987.04 --> 995.20]  goofy stuff they can make big bets they can do stuff that might be against the conventional wisdom and
[995.20 --> 1000.96]  just do what they think is right and i'm like oh that actually makes so much sense to me because
[1000.96 --> 1007.44]  that's one of the big reasons that linus media group has never solicited any kind of outside um you
[1007.44 --> 1012.56]  know shareholders or or anything like that because as much as there might have been times that we could
[1012.56 --> 1017.20]  have used the money and with our public profile there's no doubt that we could raise a bunch of
[1017.20 --> 1022.48]  money if we wanted to i i just don't want to be accountable to anyone else if i want to make a crazy
[1022.48 --> 1030.40]  decision like you know we're going to abandon tech videos and we're going to move into you know all
[1030.40 --> 1037.60]  toys and games videos on channel super fun as long as i've got my team on board my staff's like okay
[1037.60 --> 1044.40]  you know i guess you haven't really led us astray so far let's give it a shot i want to be able to do
[1044.40 --> 1049.44]  that and even though i could maintain you know 51 ownership or something like that and and make
[1049.44 --> 1056.80]  unilateral decisions you know i always feel like even if you know by law i'm not accountable to my
[1056.80 --> 1062.88]  shareholders by by sort of um i don't know what the word would be ethics is that the word i'm looking
[1062.88 --> 1069.84]  for just integrity like mores i i feel like i i should care and that should be a team decision if
[1069.84 --> 1072.72]  there's other people who have a vested stake in the company
[1076.16 --> 1081.68]  so yeah i i just i forget how i got on this topic but i thought that was cool and i and i respect it
[1081.68 --> 1087.52]  pretty much yeah like if we need to raise money we'll just issue a cryptocurrency or something yeah
[1087.52 --> 1092.32]  you know what's funny is we we had we had thought about doing it we and we had even like said on
[1092.32 --> 1097.04]  when we were like yeah we're totally gonna do it we're gonna do we're gonna do linus coin um but the
[1097.04 --> 1103.76]  further we got into the weeds on it the more we realized that um there's really no way to do it and
[1103.76 --> 1109.68]  make money without screwing over someone else so we were like oh all right well that explains why
[1109.68 --> 1118.48]  everyone's doing this uh yeah neat uh so so yeah i'm out i'm out you want to talk about this facebook
[1118.48 --> 1124.16]  thing uh no no i want to talk about the the other part of the one two punch to intel's low end
[1126.00 --> 1132.96]  so this is really cool the b550 finally appears it's been long rumored but it looks like we are getting
[1132.96 --> 1140.48]  an entry-level chipset to accompany these ryzen 3 processors and it's actually better than i expected
[1140.48 --> 1146.56]  so it's gonna have uh compared to x570 it's gonna have oh rumors never mind these are rumors little
[1146.56 --> 1153.20]  further info has been suggested other than pci gen 3 or gen 4 um all right so apparently it will feature
[1153.20 --> 1159.76]  fewer usb 3.2 gen 2 whatever that is i think that's 10 gig and sata ports and will communicate with
[1159.76 --> 1168.40]  the cpu via a pcie gen 3 link okay uh so that means with 20 usable pcie 4.0 lanes on the cpu you'd
[1168.40 --> 1173.76]  still get gen 4 speeds on your main 16x slot switch to your graphics card and a secondary x4 which would
[1173.76 --> 1180.16]  probably be m.2 and then everything else would be you know slower so if you had to if you wanted to put
[1180.16 --> 1186.08]  like 10 gigabit networking on a b550 board for whatever reason because you're crazy uh you know that
[1186.08 --> 1192.32]  could end up bottlenecked if the user also was you know writing data from that interface to an m.2 ssd
[1192.32 --> 1199.04]  that was on a on a gen 3 link on there as well um so this this is exciting ladies and gentlemen uh you
[1199.04 --> 1203.92]  know it's it it opens up a lot of possibilities for us to do some really cool builds like you know hey we
[1203.92 --> 1211.60]  did a 400 gaming machine that's actually really great and really competitive um like if i'm if i'm sony or
[1211.60 --> 1217.84]  or microsoft you know i'm i'm looking at this going like come on amd we're trying to sell these
[1217.84 --> 1222.72]  these uh you know cheap processors in our game console why you gotta just give them to everyone
[1222.72 --> 1230.72]  like this but hey it's good for us i love it i love it all right james bring us into this topic
[1230.72 --> 1234.16]  because i i really want to talk about it do you want to do you want to do the rundown through this one
[1234.16 --> 1242.72]  i i will hold my peace i'll i will i will say nothing okay so it came to the attention of this uh
[1243.52 --> 1248.00]  i guess uh a website news website that i don't know it's called the markup but they did this
[1248.00 --> 1255.20]  investigation where they they made their own ads uh using this this category of ad targeting that you
[1255.20 --> 1260.80]  can use when you make an ad on facebook you can naturally uh target it at specific uh psychographics
[1260.80 --> 1265.04]  and stuff that facebook has and that's why oh advertising on google or facebook is so awesome
[1265.04 --> 1270.08]  okay i promised i wouldn't say anything but james you've actually done some advertising for us
[1270.08 --> 1276.88]  on google and facebook right yeah yeah so can you talk about like for people who don't know like i
[1276.88 --> 1282.08]  actually don't even know that much about it can you talk us through how you create like a targeted ad
[1282.08 --> 1290.24]  in the first place um well there's a couple different types like on some platforms there's
[1290.24 --> 1296.08]  just boosted posts so any post like any video you upload to youtube or any um post that you make on
[1296.08 --> 1302.32]  instagram or facebook you could just boost so then that's why you get that little promoted box underneath
[1302.32 --> 1306.08]  it and it just gets put in front of other people who aren't on your friends list or whatever
[1306.08 --> 1311.68]  um but i think you can also just make just straight up ads that are going to apply to like the sidebar
[1311.68 --> 1316.48]  on the desktop for example um and when you're making those types of things you can choose
[1317.12 --> 1321.68]  which kind of geographic range you want them to be served to so i only want people in kansas to see
[1321.68 --> 1326.72]  this political ad for example and then there's all sorts of psychographics and demographics so
[1326.72 --> 1334.08]  i it should be women between the ages of 30 and 50 who like now here's where it comes it gets really
[1334.08 --> 1343.04]  interesting who like um exercise pants and also uh messy shoes and so those are the the targeting
[1343.04 --> 1348.56]  categories that we're talking about here where this organization the markup discovered that there was a
[1349.12 --> 1355.04]  targeting category for pseudoscience people who like pseudoscience and they created their own ads
[1355.04 --> 1360.88]  and boosted posts on instagram and facebook to target these people and the ad got approved and so then
[1360.88 --> 1366.00]  they reached out to facebook uh multiple people at facebook waited and waited waited and finally got
[1366.00 --> 1372.24]  a response and the response that they got just said uh we removed the targeting category we removed
[1372.24 --> 1379.12]  pseudoscience as a category uh and i think the reason that they did that so promptly is because they had
[1379.12 --> 1384.32]  experience doing this before for years now i think pseudoscience has been a category for like six years or
[1384.32 --> 1388.88]  something and they've had other categories that were that they've had to remove before including
[1388.88 --> 1394.72]  um vaccine controversies people who are interested in vaccine controversies chemtrail conspiracy theory
[1395.52 --> 1402.08]  and in fact i also have in the notes here jew hater and history of why jews ruin the world
[1402.08 --> 1410.16]  so wow clearly wait shut up it was i actually haven't read through the notes that was an advertising
[1410.72 --> 1418.40]  targeting category on facebook that's right so what that says to me wow there's no one working at
[1418.40 --> 1423.04]  facebook who's saying hey you know we notice a lot of users are searching this stuff let's make this
[1423.04 --> 1427.68]  a category no human is doing that it must be algorithmic right this is based on what people
[1427.68 --> 1432.32]  are typing in or based on the titles of things they're clicking on or something so to me it looks
[1432.32 --> 1437.84]  like programmatically pseudoscience although pseudoscience isn't a word that someone would put in
[1437.84 --> 1443.52]  their own yeah content i don't buy it so that's weird yeah i don't buy it if i'm if i'm interested in
[1443.52 --> 1451.20]  pseudoscience i think i've been profiled as someone who is interested in pseudoscience i don't acknowledge
[1451.20 --> 1457.92]  that because i if i'm someone who who buys into pseudoscience i don't know that pseudo like guys it's
[1457.92 --> 1464.64]  right in the name pseudo means fake i mean fake fake science they even make science like even if you
[1464.64 --> 1470.48]  think of it as alternative you're not going to use the word you would never use that exactly you think
[1470.48 --> 1476.16]  like someone who's pro-choice calling themselves pro-abortion or like or like pro-killing babies
[1476.16 --> 1480.80]  or something like that like you're using the other side's terminology to describe your own position
[1480.80 --> 1489.04]  that it's not how it happens so if i'm into pseudoscience i'm into alternative medicine or i'm into
[1489.60 --> 1495.52]  you know uh integrated health yeah i'm at the i'm at the next level right like i think i've i think i'm
[1495.52 --> 1504.48]  i'm above it i'm past it um so the fact that they have a pseudoscience category to me indicates exactly
[1504.48 --> 1511.12]  the opposite that this is 100 intentional and they're taking these gullible people who don't
[1511.12 --> 1516.32]  understand the scientific method you know the kinds of people that'll say believing in science is no
[1516.32 --> 1522.00]  different than believing in in anything else because you're just believing something that you can't that
[1522.00 --> 1527.28]  that isn't you know 100 correct it's like yeah but but the the the the the the thing behind the
[1527.28 --> 1532.24]  thing about science is that it's the pursuit of knowledge we we know it isn't perfect that's the
[1532.24 --> 1539.52]  whole point and that's no dogma yes there's no easy answer but the thing that sucks about science is
[1539.52 --> 1546.08]  that you can never prove that something doesn't exist i can never prove that cows with red polka dots
[1546.08 --> 1551.12]  don't exist i just we have they haven't been observed so there's no reason that they do exist
[1552.00 --> 1558.56]  oh yeah but that okay that gets into a much much deeper much deeper sort of conversation um so
[1559.84 --> 1568.80]  tell me this i i'm gonna have real real talk real conversation here is this the most blatantly evil
[1568.80 --> 1575.92]  thing you've seen out of facebook so far intentionally creating a category that allows you to target
[1575.92 --> 1582.96]  people who you know are gullible and vulnerable to believing things that simply have no proof that
[1582.96 --> 1591.60]  they are true and in fact may be well known to be not true well it's interesting because they're doing
[1591.60 --> 1596.88]  this simultaneously like this is all in the context of covid and simultaneously as this is happening
[1596.88 --> 1601.92]  other parts of the business including the ceo zuckerberg are making all these other efforts and
[1601.92 --> 1607.76]  announcements and and things they're implementing that are the exact opposite of this you know since
[1607.76 --> 1612.32]  the um camera giant analytical thing and maybe even before they've been so focused on trying to have
[1612.32 --> 1620.08]  truth on the platform and and try to reduce the amount of hamping from a pr perspective okay sure yes
[1620.08 --> 1627.60]  all right sure like on the 16th of april uh zuckerberg said that facebook had they added warning labels on 40
[1627.60 --> 1634.80]  million posts related to covet 19 um they have this other thing where like if you if you had engaged with
[1634.80 --> 1641.12]  a post that was known to be unsubstantiated related to covid they like gave you a notification telling
[1641.12 --> 1645.84]  you that and you could click through and go to the world health organization's website for information
[1645.84 --> 1651.28]  so parts of the business are trying but is it just the fact is are they a hydra and some of the heads
[1651.28 --> 1657.60]  don't talk to other heads it kind of priorities it kind of looks that way doesn't it because like i
[1658.88 --> 1666.16]  i okay you know what no i don't think they're a hydra i think that someone at some point who is who is
[1666.16 --> 1672.16]  aware of these you know positive initiatives has to be also aware of pseudoscience as a freaking
[1672.16 --> 1678.64]  targeted category on the platform like there's no way because okay the thing is if you're working on
[1678.64 --> 1684.64]  truth on the platform right you're looking at organic posts so so you know whatever linda or
[1684.64 --> 1689.12]  karen posted in their you know mom group or whatever you're looking at that kind of stuff
[1689.12 --> 1694.96]  but you're also looking at boosted posts so organic posts or seemingly organic posts that have been
[1694.96 --> 1699.68]  given a little kick in the butt and then you're also looking at advertising posts right because all of
[1699.68 --> 1706.32]  that is part of that transparency and and fact uh on the platform sort of initiative that they're that
[1706.32 --> 1714.48]  they're supposedly working on right so as soon as you encountered an ad right that that was obviously
[1714.48 --> 1720.88]  false i i i'm imagining what facebook's internal you know interface looks like it's probably not garbage
[1720.88 --> 1727.76]  given that they are a you know web development company so probably when i click on that post there's
[1727.76 --> 1733.44]  something akin to the uh like the business manager interface that we've got for managing our own like
[1733.44 --> 1740.08]  uh boosted or advertising posts that says what categories this post was intended to target
[1740.72 --> 1747.20]  so yeah but linus that information is exposed to facebook users now you can do that you can click on
[1747.20 --> 1753.36]  an ad and say why am i seeing this and it'll say you were selected as part of the pseudoscience category
[1753.36 --> 1759.36]  exactly so so the user can see that so it can't it's not a big secret so i don't buy the hydra argument
[1759.36 --> 1764.72]  then there's no way that these guys working on the positive initiatives couldn't have noticed this
[1764.72 --> 1770.32]  so i think it's just as simple as they want to have their cake and eat it too they want to they want to
[1770.32 --> 1778.64]  talk about how they care about people getting you know real evidence-based information but they want to make
[1778.64 --> 1783.76]  money on people peddling nonsense on the back end i think it's that simple
[1783.76 --> 1790.72]  it's gross this whole this whole theory is based on the fact that you and i can't figure out how
[1790.72 --> 1795.52]  this category was labeled the way it's labeled so there could be an easy explanation for that we're
[1795.52 --> 1802.40]  just not thinking of yeah maybe i mean ai ai tools you know they're getting they're getting pretty good
[1802.40 --> 1811.52]  maybe they managed to to to maybe the ai managed to label it on its own but that is just that is just
[1811.52 --> 1820.00]  brutal ah maybe you have to imagine that like the graph is so huge the graph meaning like the network
[1820.00 --> 1826.72]  and like how many different categories there are and how many each each user falls into it's so
[1826.72 --> 1833.28]  like unfoundably large that there's by and large there's no human like putting all the balls into
[1833.28 --> 1839.20]  different buckets it has to be happening programmatically no i just think so i agree with you there but i just
[1839.20 --> 1846.88]  also think that if they were making an earnest and honest effort to remove pseudoscience from their
[1846.88 --> 1854.32]  platform somebody working on one of those initiatives would have seen this just naturally seen this before
[1854.32 --> 1860.32]  a third party reported it to them i just don't buy that have you seen uh have you ever scrolled through
[1860.32 --> 1868.48]  facebook and seen someone's post have that flag over it that says it's fake news um no i haven't it's so
[1868.48 --> 1873.76]  sweet yeah yeah my wife showed me the other day she was scrolling through and one of those like you
[1873.76 --> 1879.52]  know those people you have on your facebook who just post stupid crap and and that that you read
[1879.52 --> 1884.40]  and you just think it's ignorant yeah that person posting that kind of thing and it just had like a
[1884.40 --> 1890.48]  superimposed on top of it there's a banner covering the content of the meme being like this meme has been
[1890.48 --> 1894.80]  shown to be inaccurate and then you can click through and like learn about why it brings you to like a fact
[1894.80 --> 1900.08]  check third party site something akin to snopes.com right and you can just read about why it's inaccurate
[1900.08 --> 1905.92]  oh that's great and it's kind of like socially it's like a slap in the face like if you post stuff that
[1905.92 --> 1912.16]  gets those banners on it it's like so shameful i'd be ashamed i yeah but you would be ashamed but that's
[1912.16 --> 1916.16]  exactly the difference is i think a lot of the people who post that kind of stuff don't understand why
[1916.16 --> 1921.52]  they should feel ashamed uh like they think they're on another level right or they double down a lot of
[1921.52 --> 1925.44]  people just double down you dig in your heels and it just makes you more dedicated to the tribe you're
[1925.44 --> 1933.04]  in because the man or the media is keeping you down whoever the opponent is okay ian viscer says
[1934.24 --> 1941.04]  for for sakes pseudoscience is theoretical science as in proven via scientific results but goes against
[1941.04 --> 1945.44]  the current acknowledged system so if you counter e equals mc squared and prove it with science it's
[1945.44 --> 1957.84]  labeled pseudoscience ian no pseudo means adjective not genuine spurious or sham pseudoscience is not real
[1957.84 --> 1969.12]  science by the very definition of pseudoscience like no that's not how it works well i mean there is uh
[1969.68 --> 1975.12]  there are things like entrance to science things that are uh kind of like under review that are not
[1975.12 --> 1979.76]  part of the canon yet that like just need more testing there are hypotheses that need to yes
[1980.32 --> 1985.20]  the difference between a hypothesis and a theory one of them or the difference sorry between a theory
[1985.20 --> 1990.64]  and a law one of them is just the test of time like the law of gravity for example like we just
[1991.28 --> 1996.32]  it's just stood for so long that it's it's part of the canon so maybe he's referring to some stuff like that
[1996.32 --> 2003.04]  that's quite possible um all right so let's move on to our next topic which is actually kind of related
[2003.04 --> 2010.08]  uh so this was originally posted on bbc actually cnn's got an article about it as well so youtube
[2010.08 --> 2016.96]  has apparently banned medically unsubstantiated content so they deleted some videos uh earlier this
[2016.96 --> 2023.84]  month that linked coronavirus to 5g and uh youtube ceo said in an interview with ccnn this week that
[2023.84 --> 2031.20]  youtube would be removing information that is problematic that is one heck of a quote youtube
[2031.20 --> 2038.16]  man google you guys just have this way of like taking something that you're doing that might not
[2038.16 --> 2048.08]  be the end of the world or horrible and being so cagey and like well you know weird and and evil about
[2048.08 --> 2053.76]  it that it makes it seem really really bad and it opens up i love that she left the door open for it
[2053.76 --> 2058.56]  to be really bad well the quote looks really bad and that's kind of part of the reason i put it in
[2058.56 --> 2064.88]  here um because it's like whoa well who's who decides and but in this case this was taken from
[2064.88 --> 2070.56]  an interview not a press release yeah not a verbiage of a new terms of service so it's just like
[2071.44 --> 2076.80]  you know she's kind of stammering she's she's doing a list um this is just what ended up coming
[2076.80 --> 2082.00]  out of her mouth during this interview so i don't think the sky is falling but it also tells you you
[2082.00 --> 2089.20]  know where the where the mindset is at right like they've they've talked about you know um elevating
[2089.20 --> 2096.72]  authoritative voices which is another way of saying you know pushing down uh non-authoritative voices
[2096.72 --> 2103.20]  right like you can't elevate on a platform like youtube there's a fixed number of of spots to promote
[2103.20 --> 2107.84]  content right it's it's finite it depends on how many users there are and how long they're on the
[2107.84 --> 2114.48]  site and and how many of those spots they encounter so it's it's it's a finite resource so by elevating
[2115.12 --> 2121.44]  uh sources that they consider to be accurate you are inherently de-elevating what would be the
[2121.44 --> 2129.84]  opposite of elevating help me out here james you're usually my my my uh lowering lower diminishing
[2129.84 --> 2134.24]  dang it diminishing sure let's go with diminishing you are diminishing the exposure of anything that
[2134.24 --> 2140.32]  you don't consider to be to be trustworthy um with that said i don't necessarily disagree with
[2140.32 --> 2146.32]  what they've defined as problematic here so anything that is medically unsubstantiated or anything going
[2146.32 --> 2152.40]  against the world health organization recommendations and there has been some backlash against the who in
[2152.40 --> 2159.20]  the last little bit but i don't think any of it has been around um their recommendations in terms of you
[2159.20 --> 2163.60]  know how diseases are transmitted and some of some of the basic stuff it seems to be more
[2163.60 --> 2171.52]  uh the politics and the culture of the world health organization and uh you know not necessarily
[2171.52 --> 2177.76]  their recommendations with respect to social distancing and stuff like that um she added that
[2177.76 --> 2183.44]  we do remove across youtube in non-pandemic times information that is in violation of our policy
[2183.44 --> 2187.84]  and they have been continually updating their policy as the virus situation changes which led to the
[2187.84 --> 2195.44]  removal of the 5g content for example so what's your take on that should they allow videos suggesting
[2195.44 --> 2202.48]  that people inject disinfectant into their bodies for example you've been following that right now part
[2203.12 --> 2209.20]  part of me is kind of like natural selection baby okay you can't say that you can't say that on the
[2209.20 --> 2217.68]  wet show awkward uh uh uh well and it's all it's also just not it's also just not true because those
[2217.68 --> 2221.20]  people like even that natural selection argument's just not true because those people are just going
[2221.20 --> 2227.12]  to be burdens on the healthcare system and it's going to hurt other people so yes um but they've made
[2227.12 --> 2231.84]  something very dangerous and people thought this uh with when the gutenberg press was invented just for
[2231.84 --> 2237.60]  uh so that anybody could just print a book it's the same thing you it's your greatest gift and your greatest curse
[2238.40 --> 2242.72]  now uh knowledge is distributed so anybody can make it and consume it and when you're making
[2243.68 --> 2247.52]  you know if you're making a video you can sound like an expert because there's no one there to contest
[2247.52 --> 2252.72]  you at the time so it's pretty dangerous so some moderation has to happen and that moderation has
[2252.72 --> 2257.76]  to happen from a centralized source so it's just always going to be problematic but then you open
[2257.76 --> 2263.28]  yourself up to new problems right because as soon as you allow a central source to you know determine
[2263.28 --> 2268.32]  what is true and what is not at the end of the day you might and i i could see this argument being
[2268.32 --> 2276.24]  made you might end up throwing out the baby with the bath water um yeah man i don't know and guys okay
[2276.24 --> 2282.48]  imagine there's just imagine that if 5g is related to covet if that happened yes they would anarchy
[2284.16 --> 2288.88]  they're pretty sure it's not though so i think they're being around like we're gonna remove things
[2288.88 --> 2294.88]  that are just blatantly poisonous yes uh we've got some people saying you know raw raw raw natural
[2294.88 --> 2301.60]  selection uh darwin awards okay guys for real though like there is that's not natural selection
[2301.60 --> 2309.92]  actually that's that's a societal problem that people do not have the proper education and the the
[2309.92 --> 2317.12]  skills that they need to ferret out untruths and when they're reading or consuming media um that's that's
[2317.12 --> 2322.80]  not natural selection that doesn't mean that they are somehow lesser that just means that for whatever
[2322.80 --> 2329.20]  reason they were not given access to the skills whether it was a cultural issue or whatever the
[2329.20 --> 2334.32]  case may be so you can't just go like oh yeah you know anyone dumb enough to believe that they should
[2334.32 --> 2340.80]  just let them all inject disinfectant into themselves um because that's really not fair like we could miss out
[2340.80 --> 2346.96]  on the next isaac newton or the next einstein because no one ever bothered to to teach
[2346.96 --> 2352.48]  them you know the actual function of disinfectant and how it does not actually work from inside the
[2352.48 --> 2355.84]  body or rather that it does work from inside the body which is exactly the problem
[2359.92 --> 2364.00]  i think we should do the sponsors yeah let's do the sponsors let's do them hard
[2366.40 --> 2372.08]  the show is also brought to you by plural site plural site is a skill development platform with 7 000
[2372.08 --> 2378.16]  expert-led video courses topics include javascript python c sharp i'm sure that's a typo i'm sure
[2378.16 --> 2387.36]  they meant c sharp and more that's gotta be goldner jano c sharp love it uh and more and plural site

[2419.28 --> 2428.08]  they're both gonna do it hey oh you've got the shoe in water okay you leveled up your your footwear
[2428.08 --> 2435.04]  your footwear shilling skills so vese makes the 100 waterproof shoe that's great for walking through
[2435.04 --> 2440.24]  rain snow mud and slush without worry their dimotex material regulates the temperature of your feet
[2440.24 --> 2445.52]  so on hot days it'll keep you cool and on cool days it'll keep you warm and vese shoes are flexible
[2445.52 --> 2450.16]  and stretchy which are kind of two ways of saying the same thing making it almost feel like a second
[2450.16 --> 2455.52]  pair of socks they're one of the lightest sneakers in the world at just 175 grams that's about the
[2455.52 --> 2461.68]  weight of an iphone and their herringbone tread pattern is designed to uh grip just about anything
[2461.68 --> 2465.68]  you walk on making them great for hikes you can actually see i've been that's actually way lighter
[2466.80 --> 2473.84]  way lighter than some iphones yes it is the 11 pro max is like 250 206 grams or something yeah i've been uh
[2473.84 --> 2477.76]  i've been super super happy with these i've actually been wearing shoes lately you'd be proud of me
[2478.96 --> 2482.64]  i've been wearing my uh my vese shoes although i don't know that i'm using them for what they
[2482.64 --> 2487.84]  intended you can actually see the wear pattern is really weird on them see that the black is basically
[2487.84 --> 2494.80]  not worn at all and same with the heel and then the middle is like beat up to crap uh that's because
[2494.80 --> 2502.32]  um i've been using them on my bike rides i actually got a bike nice that's my that's my leg day now so uh
[2502.32 --> 2507.76]  my my son got a bike and i got one and we've been going ripping around i just load the i load the girls in the trailer
[2508.24 --> 2512.24]  so that's about between the girls and the trailer it's about 150 pounds
[2512.88 --> 2519.44]  and then we go kind of at his pace but i'm hauling 150 pounds with me and it's been just a fantastic
[2519.68 --> 2525.60]  fantastic workout and you should never never ride a bike with sandals because uh my dad actually
[2525.60 --> 2531.60]  was the reason that i will never get on a bicycle with anything other than closed toed shoes as
[2531.60 --> 2539.36]  as hardcore as i am on the sandal bandwagon because his big toe was like mangled he got it caught in the
[2539.36 --> 2546.32]  chain when he was a kid and it was just like it was weird it was like split it like had like a peak on it
[2546.32 --> 2553.60]  down the middle of the the toenail really gross um anyway uh yeah vessi great guys donating surgical
[2553.60 --> 2558.24]  masks sneakers and all that kind of good stuff to local heroes you can choose what you pay starting
[2558.24 --> 2563.52]  at 95 and up and the higher the price the more vessi can donate go to vessi footwear.com
[2564.16 --> 2570.48]  linus tech tips to learn more so yeah yeah that's why i will never get on a bicycle without my vessi my
[2570.48 --> 2578.64]  vessi shoes oh oh wait i've got one more one more shilltastic thing for you guys lttstore.com suckas
[2578.64 --> 2585.20]  we have launched this is going to be exciting you guys are going to love it all right we have launched
[2585.20 --> 2591.36]  a shipping promo for our us viewers that is going to cost us a lot of money we are shipping out of
[2591.36 --> 2598.88]  canada but we are still offering 4.99 flat rate shipping across the us this weekend now through
[2598.88 --> 2606.96]  sunday 11 59 pm pacific so go check it out if you were waiting to place an order on lttstore.com
[2606.96 --> 2611.92]  and you're in the us now is the time to do it i actually don't know if it's all i can't imagine
[2611.92 --> 2617.44]  we're shipping to alaska at that rate i have no idea uh if there's any alaskans in the uh in the chat
[2617.44 --> 2622.40]  guys let me know if your region is qualifying for the shipping here but go check it out we've got water
[2622.40 --> 2628.40]  bottles we've got stealth hoodies we've got t-shirts galore and there's actually one more ltt store related
[2628.40 --> 2634.24]  thing i'm going to post this in the chat here but we've created a straw poll it looks like we are
[2634.24 --> 2639.28]  running out of things that really need to be 3d printed a lot of the stuff that the frontline
[2639.28 --> 2645.20]  workers need is moving to injection molding which is faster and more efficient than 3d printing so
[2646.00 --> 2651.12]  uh 3d printing stuff might not be a practical way to help with the effort so we've created a straw poll
[2651.12 --> 2656.64]  here i'm going to go ahead and wow the youtube chat moves so fast that i doubt you guys are even going
[2656.64 --> 2661.44]  to get a chance to click those links i'm going to drop out of the cms here on floatplane drop that
[2661.44 --> 2666.96]  in the chat and we want you guys to tell us line workers how we how we should use the rest of the
[2666.96 --> 2674.56]  funds that we collected um through selling the folding at home shirt because we for on purpose
[2674.56 --> 2679.92]  basically intentionally we did not commit to a particular use for them because we wanted to be
[2679.92 --> 2687.12]  able to do whatever is the most useful thing so uh we're going to leave it up to you guys i i fired
[2687.12 --> 2692.32]  up that straw poll there guys make sure you vote and let us know what you want us to do with the extra
[2692.32 --> 2698.32]  money that we raised with the folding at home shirt so just a reminder um the proceeds so that is
[2698.32 --> 2705.36]  after the cost of the shirts and after uh printing um the proceeds uh for the folding shirt that we sold a
[2705.36 --> 2711.84]  few weeks ago um those are are going to help covid causes but you know now that um you know our
[2711.84 --> 2716.96]  usefulness there is limited we we want to we want to know uh what you guys want so so far direct relief
[2716.96 --> 2723.76]  for homeless and shelters is leading uh bc children's hospital no one likes sick kids or that came across
[2723.76 --> 2730.72]  wrong no one likes kids being sick um i think that's a good one food bank is in number three uh canadian
[2730.72 --> 2735.52]  red cross is number four meals on wheels is number five and just because something wins doesn't mean
[2735.52 --> 2742.00]  that everything will necessarily go there what we could do is we could just split it up um that
[2742.00 --> 2746.08]  that might be a cool way to do it and just you know that way the food bank gets 21 of the funds even
[2746.08 --> 2753.12]  if they didn't win you know so uh just want to like shout you guys out because we raised like over 40 grand
[2753.12 --> 2758.48]  um so whatever you the thing you guys are voting on right now matters a lot and every vote counts
[2758.48 --> 2764.16]  especially if we do decide to divvy it up according to proportions so just huge huge shout out to you
[2764.16 --> 2770.08]  guys thank you so much and just while we're at it shout out to intel for matching um they actually
[2770.08 --> 2775.52]  matched our donation up to i believe it was 40 grand uh and they they contributed that directly to
[2775.52 --> 2779.92]  the folding at home project so it was a really really big push from our community and we're really proud
[2780.96 --> 2788.00]  uh okay nick light confirms it is everywhere in the u.s uh okay then well um wow
[2788.48 --> 2797.20]  i really hope that that works out okay neat let's move on okay oh that could get really expensive
[2797.76 --> 2805.20]  okay rtx voice rtx voice was big news this week did you try it james i didn't try it myself but i was
[2805.20 --> 2809.68]  involved in alex's video and i gotta say this is the type of thing you know when you hear about a new
[2809.68 --> 2815.84]  technology and your imagination imagines like the best way it could be and then when it actually comes out
[2815.84 --> 2821.44]  it's yeah the opposite of that it's like tech news is so cool and then tech is always like uh it's
[2821.44 --> 2825.60]  okay i have to wait another three years before it does what i want it to do this was like promise
[2825.60 --> 2830.24]  delivered i was like oh that that would be cool in concept and then it's actually like exceeding
[2830.24 --> 2835.76]  everyone's expectations it's so awesome yeah like that that short circuit video even though it went up
[2835.76 --> 2845.68]  like two or three days ago has like 675 000 views 50 000 upvotes people are jazzed about rtx voice and
[2845.68 --> 2852.16]  the coolest thing about it is that as it turns out the impressive rtx voice noise suppression app
[2852.16 --> 2858.32]  doesn't actually require ray tracing or rt or tensor course to function and there's a fallback
[2858.32 --> 2866.08]  not even yeah there's a fallback no there's a fallback to general purpose cuda course and so
[2866.08 --> 2871.76]  but yes the the good thing about it being on tensor cores was that you could be gaming and streaming
[2871.76 --> 2877.68]  and you could turn on rtx voice without using any of the resources that you used to be contributing to
[2877.68 --> 2886.96]  those other things uh yes but also anecdotally the gpgpu fallback mode uses very few gpu resources
[2886.96 --> 2894.64]  with random hkid reporting one to two percent usage on a gtx 980 and about 300 megabytes of vram usage
[2895.44 --> 2901.92]  so so sweet all of the kind of thing where you're like you use it and suddenly i'm like this is going
[2901.92 --> 2907.12]  to be on every app in two years everything's going to have it yes it's going to have it every phone app
[2907.12 --> 2912.88]  every game we all use it all the time don't turn it off it's on by default so sweet it's shockingly good
[2912.88 --> 2919.60]  like the in the video i've got my kids shrieking in the background behind me like really giving her
[2919.60 --> 2925.92]  and i i mean i couldn't hear the difference because i only hear uh like my monitoring is a direct feed
[2925.92 --> 2932.40]  from my mic so it doesn't pass through rtx voice processing before i hear it uh that's so that i
[2932.40 --> 2936.72]  don't have any latency on my own voice so that it's easier to talk so i couldn't hear the difference it
[2936.72 --> 2941.36]  was making i was just like hey alex is it like working now and he's like whoa yeah so i went back and i
[2941.36 --> 2946.64]  watched the video and it's mind-blowing it's just unbelievable because i could see it being able
[2946.64 --> 2951.12]  to get rid of something simple like the background hum of an air conditioning unit or something like
[2951.12 --> 2958.96]  that right like something predictable but to filter out human voices from a recording that is supposed to
[2958.96 --> 2966.08]  contain human voices that's next level right like filtering out the wrong voices it's amazing
[2966.08 --> 2974.16]  this is going to be so awesome when this hits headphones oh for sure for sure how long maybe
[2974.16 --> 2977.84]  two years or something like that you'll be able to get headphones that were the active noise cancelling
[2977.84 --> 2983.20]  man does variable waveforms rather than just the continuous waveforms we're used to from the engine hum
[2983.76 --> 2989.04]  actually can't hear any crying babies nothing man it's gonna it's gonna change air travel forever
[2989.04 --> 2997.76]  assuming the air travel industry survives um oops oh sorry by the time you put you ride on a plane again
[2997.76 --> 3003.44]  you might have these yeah i know right so the crazy thing is you can actually run the cuda version on
[3003.44 --> 3016.00]  hardware as old as fermi so that would be a gtx 400 series it's like what what is that 10 years ago or something like that it's ridiculous 10 11 years ago
[3016.00 --> 3026.40]  um all you have to do is make a quick edit to the file after launching the installer for it to install and run normally on non-rtx hardware
[3027.36 --> 3038.32]  that's pretty crazy um now it may be any way to use this on integrated graphics at all uh no so even the backup code path is cuda
[3038.32 --> 3045.68]  so that would require nvidia nvidia hardware um some there's some speculation that the reason nvidia didn't
[3045.68 --> 3052.96]  just open it up to everyone might be that um it does use some of your gpu resources that could
[3052.96 --> 3058.40]  otherwise be used for gaming and does use some of your vram so they might have been concerned about
[3058.96 --> 3066.40]  um you know you know i mean we all remember the gtx 970 memory problem where part of the memory was slower
[3066.40 --> 3070.72]  that led to a class action lawsuit over false advertising i mean if they came out and they were like hey
[3070.72 --> 3078.00]  there's no performance impact and it turns out there is a small performance impact maybe that was their reason for withholding this version or maybe
[3078.00 --> 3084.16]  they just wanted to trickle it out i mean they've definitely done that in the past where they've given us a little bit of good news
[3084.16 --> 3087.60]  followed by more good news even though all the good news was ready in the first place
[3087.60 --> 3096.72]  i mean they're nvidia is really good at ai they publish a ton of ai research papers if you ever follow the youtuber two minute papers
[3096.72 --> 3104.56]  sweet youtube channel um does a lot of um uh you know like you see those research papers where
[3104.56 --> 3109.84]  they have like an algorithm just like removing something from a photo and like just interpolating
[3109.84 --> 3113.92]  what the space behind that object would have looked like and it just looks perfect nvidia does a lot of
[3113.92 --> 3118.64]  stuff like that they're very good at ai but i would expect other players to make similar technology to this
[3118.64 --> 3125.52]  really soon maybe it'll even end up being a pixel only feature from google because google is also very good at ai
[3125.52 --> 3136.40]  right yep and i think that i'm trying to remember if um if the latest pixels already have ai specific
[3136.40 --> 3142.24]  processing hardware in them do they have uh i i know huawei brands it an npu i'm trying to remember if
[3142.24 --> 3148.64]  google has an analogous unit inside uh the snapdragon versions that they're using i actually can't remember
[3148.64 --> 3155.36]  i mean there's a lot of phones that are already out there with ai specific hardware in them and i
[3155.36 --> 3161.28]  use ai loosely here what i really mean is machine learning of course in this case um but the photo
[3161.28 --> 3167.36]  processor i believe and maybe like a secure enclave yeah the circle the secure enclave probably wouldn't
[3167.36 --> 3172.72]  be useful for this kind of thing but the the the photo processor is something that could potentially
[3172.72 --> 3177.12]  be used you'd never be on a call and taking a picture at this well okay you could i guess but that
[3177.12 --> 3181.76]  would be very rare to be on a call and taking a picture at the same time so depending on the horsepower
[3181.76 --> 3185.84]  behind it maybe you could see something like this in your phone man that would be outstanding wouldn't
[3185.84 --> 3196.96]  it love it uh all right rumor apple to sell macs with its own chips starting in 2021 apple is reportedly
[3196.96 --> 3202.08]  preparing to release at least one mac with its own chip next year but the initiative codename
[3202.08 --> 3207.92]  kalamata to develop three different chips based on the next iphone's a14 processor suggests the company
[3207.92 --> 3213.76]  will transition more of its mac lineup away from its current supplier intel uh tsmc is rumored to be
[3213.76 --> 3219.36]  building the new mac chips which will be based on a five nanometer production technique from oh yeah
[3219.36 --> 3225.52]  tsmc i guess i already said that so it's the same as the next iphones and ipad pros and uh the first mac
[3225.52 --> 3230.72]  processors will allegedly have eight high performance cores codename firestorm and at least four energy
[3230.72 --> 3239.12]  efficient cores no codename ice storm wow they used to do their own code name man this is going to be
[3239.12 --> 3244.24]  crazy so having macs iphones and ipads running the same underlying technology could make it easier for
[3244.24 --> 3248.64]  apple to unify its app ecosystems and update its computers more often now one thing that's a little
[3248.64 --> 3255.36]  confusing to me is apple has got to be i don't know a decade away from building something that could
[3255.36 --> 3262.48]  conceivably end up in a successor to the mac pro so if they knew they were going down this path which
[3262.48 --> 3266.40]  if they're releasing something next year they would have known two three years ago four years five years
[3266.40 --> 3271.76]  ago that they were going down this path uh why did they bother to do the mac pro like is the mac pro
[3271.76 --> 3281.44]  just going to be this like weird abandonware product a few years from now again like is this is mac pro just
[3281.44 --> 3286.48]  going to turn into like this meme where it's like hey yeah we made a new mac pro and it's good it's
[3286.48 --> 3290.64]  got all this great stuff and you're going to be able to upgrade haha yeah forget uh i forget we ever
[3290.64 --> 3296.32]  said anything is that what's going to happen it could but if it's like six years later then who cares
[3296.88 --> 3301.60]  because if you're in the market for such hardware then and you're continuing to do your job then your
[3301.60 --> 3305.92]  your update cycle is probably within that time frame anyway they're like they're probably going to
[3305.92 --> 3314.00]  start with the macbook air or like the the least demanding macbook right so i don't know alex has
[3314.00 --> 3319.84]  his take in here uh his family apparently bought a power pc mac two years before they switched to intel
[3319.84 --> 3324.08]  and he said yeah you were basically screwed no matter what because these were your options
[3324.08 --> 3329.12]  continue using mac os 9 made for power pc and slowly have your application stop receiving updates
[3329.12 --> 3336.00]  but at least it's fast um also the programs that were bought for mac os 9 still worked like f18 korea
[3336.00 --> 3341.68]  gold okay thank you alex for that or switch to mac os 10 which was made for intel and have everything
[3341.68 --> 3347.52]  chug on your power pc almost all programs for mac os 9 didn't work at least current programs received
[3347.52 --> 3355.12]  updates though like okay yeah i i can i can see this being pretty pretty nasty because any kind of
[3355.12 --> 3362.08]  emulation of x86 is going to come with a significant performance penalty and apple's been on x86 for a
[3362.08 --> 3368.32]  long time now like if they had made this transition sort of quickly again before everyone got settled
[3368.32 --> 3371.44]  maybe it would have been easier or maybe people would have been even more mad i don't know what
[3371.44 --> 3376.48]  would have been the better move but maybe they'll give you an up like a bonus or a bundle for an up
[3376.48 --> 3378.96]  upgrade path or maybe they'll do a buyback or something like that
[3378.96 --> 3386.56]  hmm all right i doubt it apple has i i can't think of any time they've done something as consumer
[3386.56 --> 3392.00]  friendly as a buyback there's no way it depends it depends on the pushback they get like everybody
[3392.00 --> 3398.00]  freaked out about the um the throttling of the cpu when the uh because of the battery health and then
[3398.00 --> 3403.60]  they started offering battery replacements right that is true actually you know what i take it back
[3403.60 --> 3409.12]  that was a fairly consumer friendly way to handle that uh we've got one more one more that i really
[3409.12 --> 3413.92]  want to talk about uh android automotive coming soon not to be confused with android auto because
[3414.48 --> 3419.84]  google cannot stick to anything um android automotive will not require a phone plugged into
[3419.84 --> 3425.44]  your car in order to operate and will be arriving in the volvo polestar 2 an all-electric car so
[3425.44 --> 3430.80]  the whole infotainment system is going to be powered by android 10 and will offer google integrations
[3430.80 --> 3437.28]  um he says also the polestar 2 has 408 horsepower and i really want to unbox one
[3437.28 --> 3443.76]  uh okay duly noted alex thank you very much for that yeah i mean they sort of do there's like pdi
[3443.76 --> 3448.88]  right like they've got that uh you know that white vinyl wrap on it and stuff you know what i'll tell
[3448.88 --> 3454.00]  you what i mean short circuit like that's the whole idea behind that channel is like i don't give what
[3454.56 --> 3458.72]  products we cover whatever you're passionate about just go for it right luke was right about the
[3458.72 --> 3466.00]  swearing thing how i can't hear the beep it's so jarring so if you can convince volvo to give
[3466.00 --> 3472.72]  you one to like unbox we'll do a short circuit no problem uh all right i i lied there's one more one
[3472.72 --> 3478.64]  more big deal uh the fcc has ratified unlicensed use of the six gigahertz radio frequency spectrum in
[3478.64 --> 3483.76]  the usa opening up the way for the proposed wi-fi 6e standard i thought that was dead in the water
[3483.76 --> 3490.08]  it's back baby this is the biggest spectrum edition since the fcc cleared the way for wi-fi in 1989 this
[3490.08 --> 3497.84]  is a big deal um so six gigahertz is as you can probably tell from the name a little bit higher than
[3497.84 --> 3501.76]  five gigahertz so that means we're expecting a little bit less range but a little bit more data
[3501.76 --> 3510.16]  throughput and what's really cool is that uh it is a big big chunk of spectrum so it's about the same
[3510.16 --> 3517.12]  theoretical top speed as five gigahertz about 9.6 gigabit per second um but i would expect to see
[3517.12 --> 3523.76]  performance improvements kind of across the board as spectrum just kind of gets less crowded so even
[3523.76 --> 3529.04]  if you are going to stick on five gigahertz if your neighbor moves to six your wi-fi is going to get
[3529.04 --> 3534.08]  noticeably faster um assuming that you and your neighbor are both heavy users new streaming video and
[3534.08 --> 3539.12]  stuff like obviously if neither of you were really using it it won't get much faster uh industry giants intel
[3539.12 --> 3544.00]  and broadcom began planning for this move two years ago uh broadcom released its first wi-fi
[3544.00 --> 3549.60]  6e chipset in february oh wow so this is like oh this is great this is like this is coming deployment
[3549.60 --> 3554.56]  should really kick off in 2021 when the wi-fi alliance begins offering certifications for wi-fi
[3554.56 --> 3563.60]  6e devices i'm jazzed more more wi-fi more faster wi-fi you know more spectrum can't uh you can't
[3563.60 --> 3570.88]  can't get me down about that i love it leading us to super chats and james i know that you're you

[3601.36 --> 3611.20]  um yeah oh wait do i have it add existing hey hey look at that all right
[3611.20 --> 3617.04]  you know leave a little pixel there let's do some super chats shall we ladies and gentlemen
[3617.04 --> 3623.12]  oh it seems to be bugged no new super chats or members yet but i know i definitely saw some come
[3623.12 --> 3628.32]  in if i reload this page is it gonna break it worse though shoot i might not have your super chats guys
[3630.48 --> 3633.92]  i blame youtube i blame you youtube
[3633.92 --> 3643.12]  the page is not even reloading help me out here youtube come on hey it's in there nice all right
[3643.12 --> 3646.88]  i'm just going to expand this window a little bit so that my scroll bar works it really is just an
[3646.88 --> 3653.20]  awful page uh marcos asks how's retirement oh it's great it's great i love retirement it's exactly like
[3653.20 --> 3658.80]  before you know i can i can hardly even tell the difference very comfortable uh lucky falcor any plans
[3658.80 --> 3665.60]  to keep the rtx intro we are potentially exploring doing something like that right now i believe we
[3665.60 --> 3672.00]  have a license to use it one time um and if it's possible to have a license to use it uh all the time
[3672.00 --> 3676.08]  the audience reaction to it was very good so we would definitely be interested in that option
[3676.56 --> 3682.48]  um james old digis says with the massive speeds of usb 3.1 plus portable os's are finally viable daily
[3682.48 --> 3687.60]  drivers would you consider doing a video on them like windows to go versus linux the thing is that it's not
[3687.60 --> 3692.72]  about the sequential speed like we actually showed running windows on a super fast sd card
[3693.36 --> 3700.24]  the issue is the random io and it's still not good enough um usb has some protocol overhead that is
[3700.24 --> 3708.64]  not present in i mean definitely not nvme not even sata um so yeah i guess it's like kind of viable but
[3709.28 --> 3714.00]  i still wouldn't necessarily recommend it i'll i'll think about it though i'll think about it thanks for
[3714.00 --> 3719.28]  the idea james robert says i'm writing this super chat on behalf of dozens of us i'm putting my
[3719.28 --> 3724.32]  money where my mouth is we want taron green duct tape short circuit shirts and we want them as soon
[3724.32 --> 3731.12]  as reasonably possible uh oh man i don't even know if we have any short circuit merch yet we are working
[3731.12 --> 3740.32]  on it we've got a really cool long sleeve design that i'm excited about um but no uh dominic says for
[3740.32 --> 3744.16]  the last few weeks on float plane the audio slowly goes out of sync as the video plays make sure you
[3744.16 --> 3749.76]  send a message to support um just because they may want some extra information from you with respect to
[3749.76 --> 3754.40]  uh what device you're using and like if you're in your browser versus the app or whatever the case
[3754.40 --> 3759.76]  may be thank you for that uh jason says luke is hot um that wasn't luke on the show today
[3759.76 --> 3762.48]  uh but i'm sure he appreciates the sentiment either way
[3762.48 --> 3769.52]  uh tommy gun says have you been to germany uh yes or wait he says you have been to germany yes
[3769.52 --> 3774.56]  yes i have uh what do you think about my fellow citizens oh man i don't know what do you jeez
[3774.56 --> 3781.04]  be honest and deeply offensive if needed i would never i would never uh generalize about an entire
[3781.84 --> 3787.12]  country of citizens based on the limited amount of time that i have spent in germany on a couple of
[3787.12 --> 3793.28]  trips there for work um you know i will say that i have yet to go anywhere where i have been
[3793.28 --> 3800.48]  disappointed in the hospitality of the people uh germany was was great in that regard um and if
[3800.48 --> 3806.88]  there's one generalization that i'll make i i was blown away by the organization of german businesses
[3806.88 --> 3813.60]  well i was over there i can say that much uh what else we got here i'm just going to do a few more here
[3813.60 --> 3820.00]  guys uh mike adam says please turn off your microsoft teams okay yes i would but i've been
[3820.00 --> 3827.52]  having an issue where if i if i take the the chat audio and i put it into my go xlr i can't boost it
[3827.52 --> 3833.20]  high enough with the mixer so i have to take i have to instead have it go through system and then i have
[3833.20 --> 3838.32]  to boost it in software that way because you guys keep complaining it's not loud enough so um i'm hoping
[3838.32 --> 3844.56]  to have no no teams notifications uh next week but uh yeah i'll get back to you on that oh i missed
[3844.56 --> 3849.60]  something the folding at home shirts uh we have a delivery update we are receiving them saturday
[3849.60 --> 3855.28]  morning so uh that's from the printer so they will hopefully all be shipped next week uh thank you for
[3855.28 --> 3865.36]  your patience guys um oh this is a great question from rob i kind of wish i had like brandon on the
[3865.36 --> 3870.40]  show to talk talk about this with or david or something did red f up the hydrogen one launch so
[3870.40 --> 3876.16]  badly that we will never see a flagship phone that connects to a custom sensor and lens mount to make
[3876.16 --> 3884.24]  like a black magic uh pocket cinema camera killer like cine phone possibly i think that if i was someone
[3884.24 --> 3890.00]  else looking at how badly red flubbed that i would go wow i want exactly none of that action
[3890.00 --> 3896.40]  um that's a really great question uh alex says which rgb lighting solution would you recommend
[3897.28 --> 3903.20]  nzxt hue corsair rsync etc trying not to have a dozen different programs uh you know what we've
[3903.20 --> 3909.12]  been pretty pleased with ek's so far their controller uses all non-proprietary bs so you don't have to deal
[3909.12 --> 3915.28]  with like corsair's little weird connector that nobody else uses and stuff like that um i haven't looked at
[3915.28 --> 3920.56]  what the cpu usage is like and i haven't spent a ton of time in the software i'd say corsairs is
[3920.56 --> 3927.28]  really mature if you're willing to accept that you kind of need to buy corsair stuff that's one of the
[3927.28 --> 3931.44]  reasons we throw commander pros in a lot of our showcase builds just because like it just works
[3931.44 --> 3938.32]  um so there that's my take on that uh js2k says i look forward to buying rolex style stock and lmg
[3938.32 --> 3946.64]  through lttstore.com uh yeah i'm not planning to raise funds anytime in the foreseeable future uh
[3946.64 --> 3952.72]  linus media group contrary to what some of the speculative posts i've seen on the forum have said
[3953.36 --> 3960.40]  linus media group is absolutely financially stable uh in such a way that we just you know we we have
[3960.40 --> 3965.28]  lots of opportunity to invest in the things that we think are important for our business and for our
[3965.28 --> 3973.68]  community without having to uh deal with any external stakeholders so um you know yvonne and i are the
[3973.68 --> 3979.92]  shareholders of linus media group incorporated and that's the way that we plan to plan to keep it um
[3981.84 --> 3990.08]  all right let's see if there's uh theory says peony nope cloverdale rodeo nope many nopes ltx question
[3990.08 --> 3996.64]  mark so that's a great question and we will have an update for you guys soon but i unfortunately
[3996.64 --> 4009.20]  do not have one that i can share just yet not just yet um all right so that's pretty much it for the
[4010.16 --> 4016.56]  oh okay one more question one more arian arian 19 where does the price performance start decreasing
[4016.56 --> 4022.64]  on the amd lineup for someone who will mostly game um i really like the 3600 i think it is a great
[4022.64 --> 4027.84]  balance of fantastic gaming performance good price and also the ability to do other stuff
[4028.48 --> 4034.08]  if you if you're into that uh or if maybe you just want great resale value on your chip instead of
[4034.08 --> 4038.88]  buying something that's pigeonholed into just gaming you know just with games today all right
[4038.88 --> 4042.56]  thanks for tuning into the wan show i hope you guys enjoyed it we'll see you again next week
[4042.56 --> 4056.56]  same bat time same bat channel and stream
