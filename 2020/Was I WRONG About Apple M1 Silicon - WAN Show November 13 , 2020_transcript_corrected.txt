[0.00 → 13.38] welcome ladies and gentlemen to the WAN show it's going to be a fantastic show today WAN show
[13.38 → 26.34] I love this button have we gotten you a go XLR yet no you have to get your own swear button I think
[26.34 → 30.36] it's I think it's my fault though I think I'm supposed to go pick one up go pick one up go
[30.36 → 35.16] pick one up it's worth if it's worth it can have your own swear button it's the best thing
[35.16 → 42.84] ever all right guys we got a lot of great topics for you all today Apple Silicon is
[42.84 → 49.62] real it's coming its coming and there's been a lot of controversy a little bit of controversy
[49.62 → 55.74] about Apple Silicon so we're going to be talking about that for sure also in other more gaming
[55.74 → 61.32] related news a couple of next-gen consoles fricking launched I was playing around with
[61.32 → 68.52] the PlayStation 5 yesterday David who you guys probably know best as one of our regulars on
[68.52 → 75.54] our carpool critics movie podcast or as one of our camera operators actually is taking his first crack
[76.14 → 84.12] at writing an LTT video it started with hey David um James and I are both tied up today can you go
[84.12 → 92.28] ahead and uh do some like image quality comparisons between the Series X and the PS5 and then ended up
[92.28 → 98.88] with David went and took the initiative and like wrote an entire script for comparing the for comparing
[98.88 → 104.52] the next gen consoles um I will well okay we'll talk a little bit more about that later, but I am very
[104.52 → 112.92] excited to shoot that video what else we got that's cool um also TSMC is building a 3.5 billion dollar
[112.92 → 121.08] five nanometre fab in Arizona very cool and user benchmark gets blasted on social media due to
[121.08 → 127.92] inaccurate CPU ranking user benchmark you're that user benchmark getting blasted is a headline topic
[127.92 → 136.08] what about YouTube cancelling rewind oh you don't want to talk when's the last time when's the last time you
[136.08 → 147.48] like to rewind I want to be in rewind and if they cancel it I will never get a chance that's going to be one more
[147.48 → 153.06] thing Will Smith is better than I at make your own rewind we could make our we could do tech
[153.06 → 163.08] rewind, but first we're going to do tech fast-forward to after the intro boom legit do like oh what's
[163.08 → 169.38] what what what's his face uh Brett did one uh you have to check he did one I think last year wasn't it
[169.38 → 174.00] yeah, and it was cool, but you could like way better than the regular ones
[174.00 → 183.84] I'm not willing to see the problem with the problem with the whole uh rewind thing oh Lord I uh
[183.84 → 191.28] oh well that's a little awkward I don't have the artwork for the sponsors uh well that's something I'll have
[191.28 → 197.58] to fix at some point just like uh buy time for a little bit no, no no we good we good I
[197.58 → 204.54] mean what what what are sponsors pay for the show like come on nerds yeah exactly pays for shows
[204.54 → 211.98] who cares what they think it's an it's a terrible show it's a terrible show all right so William CLI
[211.98 → 217.14] on the forums managed to be the first to create or at least one of the people who created a thread
[217.14 → 224.72] about Apple Silicon now I know a lot of you guys are going to be tuned in to watch me address all
[224.72 → 231.98] the things that I got wrong in my video about their new M1 Silicon but first why don't we run through
[231.98 → 237.88] exactly what Apple announced at their event this week so after you could avoid getting things wrong
[237.88 → 243.76] because they would talk to you about stuff um no they wouldn't after literally years of speculation
[243.76 → 250.64] speculation the announcement was made um at this year's WWDC in June and Apple has now
[250.64 → 259.40] finally unveiled three new Macs based on their M1 chip Apple's in-house SoC now an in-house SoC from
[259.40 → 265.70] Apple is actually nothing new they've been doing that for over 10 years, but an in-house SoC designed
[265.70 → 272.54] for anything other than a traditionally mobile device like a phone or an iPad that is a new thing okay
[272.54 → 279.42] strictly speaking an Apple TV is not a phone or an iPad, but it's a phone or iPad I mean come on um
[279.42 → 285.90] all right so the M1 is a package on package design that integrates multiple chips CPU GPU IO secure
[285.90 → 291.62] enclave and a neural engine together into one stacked package with several advantages including
[291.62 → 298.28] lower latency smaller footprint and simpler power delivery, so the RAM is built directly into the
[298.28 → 304.60] package now as a unified pool of memory um it's accessible by the CPU GPU and neural engine and
[304.60 → 309.84] we're hoping to see some kind of performance improvement on account of that level of integration
[309.84 → 319.02] but this has the side effect of limiting your memory options to 8 gigs or 16 gigs max with no expansion
[319.02 → 326.80] possible total power consumption has been estimated at 18 watts with Apple's slides showing 10 watts uh bear in mind
[326.80 → 334.08] guys you know the performance per watt of a chip varies wildly depending on how close you are to the
[334.08 → 341.12] very edges of its capabilities uh so depending on how Apple had it clocked uh it's quite possible that it'll
[341.12 → 347.68] run at 18 watts even though they were talking about how efficient it was at 10 watts it's also possible that it
[347.68 → 354.08] will only run at 18 watts for short periods of time like during a burst load for example obviously that's the
[354.08 → 360.24] kind of stuff that until we have hands-on with these systems we can't really make any educated guesses about
[360.96 → 367.84] Apple claims that the M1 is the world's fastest CPU core but crucially omitted real-world comparison
[367.84 → 375.12] points that would lend credibility to that claim it's important to remember that ARM is very, very different
[375.12 → 382.96] from x86 so it matters a lot which workloads they're using for comparison uh even between comparatively much
[382.96 → 389.28] more similar CPU cores from AMD and Intel some workloads prefer one design over another like you can have
[389.28 → 394.00] i mean it's something I've been asked if i had a dollar for every time someone asked me you know
[394.00 → 402.48] why is AMD only clocked it you know 4.2 gigahertz and Intel is clocked at 4.9 gigahertz and the AMD one is just as fast
[403.20 → 408.80] because they're not the same thing they execute the same code sort of yeah sort of
[408.80 → 415.36] but they're not the same thing architecturally they are very, very different i mean going back to
[415.36 → 420.64] when i was first getting into this stuff you know one of the biggest revolutionary changes that's
[420.64 → 426.24] happened with x86 in the time that I've been an enthusiast was integrating the memory controller
[426.24 → 434.64] onto the CPU die what it did was it drastically lowered memory latency in a way that had an enormous
[434.64 → 444.00] impact on performance they were both still x86 chips but one of them was just way faster um so
[444.00 → 451.20] it's absolutely possible that Apple's chips are you know freaking incredible but what we don't know is
[451.20 → 458.96] while doing what um so for example media encode and decode is handled via hardware blocks in Apple
[458.96 → 464.80] Silicon while previous Macs relied on software the result is more speed and better efficiency for
[464.80 → 471.60] Apple Silicon, but this has actually nothing to do whatsoever with the CPU core itself a non-tech
[471.60 → 477.28] though is under the impression that it will live up to Apple's claims and the first three m1 Macs are
[477.28 → 483.52] going to be the MacBook Air for $999 it's fanless so I'd be surprised if that one goes over that 10 watts that
[483.52 → 490.96] Apple was talking about a 400 nit display headphone jack and 18-hour battery the MacBook Pro at $1300
[490.96 → 498.16] with a 500 nit p3 display touch bar headphone jack and 20-hour battery and the Mac mini for $700 with no
[498.16 → 505.92] internal expansion no 10 gig Ethernet option and none of the new Macs seem to offer any differentiation
[505.92 → 513.12] between their m1 implementations and all have a maximum of two thunderbolt slash USB 4.0 ports and
[513.52 → 519.12] it's sort of a little bit of a question mark right now what exactly they mean by
[519.76 → 528.40] thunderbolt and why exactly it would be that these thunderbolt ports do not support external GPUs because
[528.40 → 537.92] an external GPU is pretty much just connected via PCI Express which is what is the underlying technology
[537.92 → 545.12] for thunderbolt so why exactly it is that it wouldn't support external GPUs is not clear we've ordered
[545.12 → 551.68] all three so get subscribed so you don't miss our coverage let's talk about the things i got wrong here
[551.68 → 557.92] though
[557.92 → 568.32] would you get wrong Linus i can't think of anything in the video i said it was an iPad it is an iPad
[568.32 → 575.44] no you said the chip is an iPad okay did i specifically word it that way that
[575.44 → 580.48] is probably that is probably possible no i no that's not the way i worded it no I'm just I'm i said that
[580.48 → 586.16] i said that the new machines were iPads without a touch screen iPads with iPad with a touch bar and
[586.16 → 590.80] than iPad with no touch screen or touch bar or something like that so i don't know what to
[590.80 → 596.48] throw at you so i was just if is twitch chat or float plane chat gives me something I'll challenge
[596.48 → 603.36] them but i don't I have not been able to figure it out so what i didn't do was take apple at face
[603.36 → 610.40] value there are a couple of things that probably are valid criticisms of the video i was a little bit
[610.40 → 617.68] snarky because and you know I'll own this because it tends to put me in a bad mood when brands get out
[617.68 → 625.04] on stage and make vague and unsubstantiated claims and that really is what apple did apple went and
[625.04 → 637.28] launched a product with a lot of unlabelled graphs and a lot of very um well how do i put this a lot
[637.28 → 646.08] of very optimistic claims about this product without really in my mind addressing some of what i expect to
[646.08 → 653.04] be very real problems for early adopters because the reality of it is if I'm expected to review this
[653.04 → 661.76] product today i have to evaluate it the way that it is today and so in my mind apple was pretty
[661.76 → 668.56] disingenuous about the way that they presented not necessarily the m1 silicon but the products that they
[668.56 → 677.12] are equipping with it um i yeah i don't really know what else to say about it other than
[677.12 → 685.92] this is a clear downgrade in some obvious ways while offering hopefully an upgrade based on unlabelled
[685.92 → 691.76] graphs another thing that we could have gotten uh we could have gotten right if we had waited longer to
[691.76 → 699.04] make the video was we were really frustrated that apple didn't get specific about the comparison
[699.04 → 709.92] systems that they were using and I've been oh hold on a second uh yeah Riley knows that again touch with
[709.92 → 717.36] me all right um and I've been informed that apple has actually added more information to the bottom of the
[717.36 → 724.16] web page for the new m1 processor um about what systems were used for comparison the problem though
[724.16 → 731.60] is that it's still not very specific so during the presentation that information wasn't available
[731.60 → 736.56] wasn't made immediately obvious and then yes it was added later to a product page which we didn't see
[736.56 → 741.04] because this was a video that we rushed out because we were reacting to the announcement
[741.04 → 746.88] um, but it's still not very specific it still just says stuff like core i3 like okay
[747.36 → 753.12] there are a lot of core i3 processors out there it would be really nice if like a company that's
[753.12 → 759.52] confident in their product you just came out and said it's a core i3 here's the model number it was
[759.52 → 765.60] integrated in this particular laptop because that's actually really important for mobile products
[765.60 → 771.20] because you can have the exact same core i3 configured to different TDPS with very different
[771.20 → 777.20] performance characteristics um so when i titled the video that's the last thing that i
[777.20 → 782.96] probably got wrong when i titled the video i probably shouldn't have used the word dumpster fire
[782.96 → 789.12] i thought it was obvious that i was evaluating Apple's event in fact that is the title of the
[789.12 → 795.76] video which i have not altered i think it's apple m1 silicon announcement a slow motion dumpster fire
[795.76 → 802.48] because there's a lot of stuff that was wrong about the way that they did that um there are some other
[802.48 → 809.68] problems that i have to people who are defending the move to Apple Silicon and the m1 and in
[809.68 → 815.84] particular the new mac seem to be under the impression that i think it's horrible i said right at the end of
[815.84 → 823.84] the video i think this is going to end up good but what i also said is i think that these first products are
[823.84 → 830.88] going to end up abandoned much like the Apple Watch Series zero and which they didn't even merit a proper
[830.88 → 837.28] name they literally referred to it as series zero you were literally a beta tester which is what i said
[837.28 → 843.84] in my review of it like sorry not sorry looks like i was right um and then the same thing that happened
[843.84 → 852.32] to the iPad which got something like two generations of iOS less support than any other full-sized iPad and
[852.32 → 857.84] it actually got i think three or four generations of less iOS support compared to the iPad too
[857.84 → 866.64] like apple has a history of doing this why are we pretending that they don't I never said that it's
[866.64 → 872.64] going to be slow i never said that they're not going to succeed in this transition a lot of the things
[872.64 → 879.44] that are I'm sort of being accused of like hating apple or whatever didn't happen i just do not
[879.44 → 887.76] appreciate nonsense in keynotes and i don't appreciate paying to beta test products i don't like it from
[887.76 → 893.52] apple and i wouldn't like it from anyone and nobody should why are we accepting these clear compromises
[893.52 → 898.80] i was getting people are giving me a really hard time i saw quite a few comments once what are you
[898.80 → 903.12] talking about there's no memory expansion that hasn't been a thing on macBooks for ages
[904.32 → 911.68] apple announced three products one of them was a Mac mini the last generation Mac mini has sodium slots
[911.68 → 918.88] you can upgrade your memory in the Mac mini you can also have 10 gig networking why doesn't apple have
[918.88 → 926.32] the option for 10 gig networking i am a Mac mini customer i literally own three mac minis for work
[926.32 → 930.88] and the reason i bought them was because they were actually very compelling little machines i didn't need
[930.88 → 935.36] them to perform great over a long period of time didn't care if they thermal throttled they had good
[935.36 → 940.96] networking at an affordable price, and they run macOS which we needed for some tool that we were using for
[941.68 → 948.32] the footage so it's like i am actually a customer for this product and i am looking at this new
[948.32 → 956.48] generation product going oh you managed to deep it good job maybe it has a fast CPU or whatever that like
[957.04 → 964.88] hopefully works in a broad range of applications except oh oops freaking photoshop isn't ready for at
[964.88 → 972.24] least a couple of months photoshops not ready is it really that crazy for me to come out and say
[972.24 → 977.84] apple rushed this thing all right I've talked for a long time I'm so sorry Luke you might have even
[977.84 → 984.64] tuned out by this point but what's your take people think i have resting angry person face by the way i was
[984.64 → 991.92] reading stuff and trying to watch a video which was uh one of uh Jonathan Morrison's responses to your video on
[991.92 → 997.20] twitter and i look over to the flow plane chat everyone's like are you okay why is he so mad I'm
[997.20 → 1004.24] like I'm just watching a video and I'm not even like mad about the video i like everything's fine um
[1004.80 → 1012.56] yeah i don't know i think um Jonathan Morrison's example was interesting uh it's interesting but
[1012.56 → 1019.36] irrelevant i mean it's a completely apples to oranges comparison um you're looking at fixed
[1019.36 → 1025.20] function hardware versus like software encoding hey Luke you know a thing or two about encoding um
[1025.20 → 1030.88] you want to explain to us why comparing that sort of thing doesn't make a ton of sense
[1031.68 → 1033.44] there yeah it's its com
[1036.88 → 1041.92] it's its totally different jobs it's not like they're you're you're asking for completely different
[1041.92 → 1048.56] stuff to do completely different things um and like honestly for a lot of users i can understand
[1048.56 → 1054.64] why that would be interesting sure because they don't care about that they care about how long
[1054.64 → 1061.28] it takes to put the video absolutely and what apple did is great for mobile users who are recording a
[1061.28 → 1066.80] video on their phone and then want to upload it to YouTube or a social media platform or whatever the
[1066.80 → 1074.16] case may be uh it's perfect for that uh the problem is that you can't build fixed function hardware
[1074.16 → 1081.84] to address every random edge case that you would encounter on a desktop or a laptop or in a desktop
[1081.84 → 1088.48] or laptop environment um you know today was a perfect example I'm working on a project that i can't really
[1088.48 → 1093.84] talk about it's not my project it's someone else's project so i really can't give you guys any details
[1093.84 → 1102.00] but there's a lot of people collaborating from different locations because coronavirus um and the people who are
[1102.00 → 1107.28] working on this project are going to get a lot of different kinds of footage encoded at different
[1107.28 → 1112.32] resolutions and different bit rates they're going to be combining them all into one timeline and i pretty
[1112.32 → 1117.76] much guarantee you that apple is not going to be able to build in the fixed function decode and encode
[1117.76 → 1125.28] hardware for all of these different things and that's yeah that's one of the disadvantages of a more
[1125.28 → 1132.96] generalized architecture yup that's a disadvantage but rather that's one of the advantages is that
[1132.96 → 1139.68] it's not as fast that's the disadvantage when the conditions are right, but it can handle pretty much
[1139.68 → 1146.64] anything, so someone in the full plane chat said i mean I'm going to change their wording slightly but
[1147.04 → 1150.80] um says a person who loves intel quick sync
[1150.80 → 1158.00] quick sync is cool i wouldn't describe myself as a person who loves intel quick sync there's a time and
[1158.00 → 1163.68] a place for it when you want to do a quick and dirty encode quick sync is freaking awesome like for
[1163.68 → 1170.64] example uh what was I trying to do a little while ago i don't remember there was some reason okay this
[1170.64 → 1174.88] wasn't a little while ago wow this would have been a long time ago uh there was some reason that i was
[1174.88 → 1182.24] trying to encode um a bunch of seasons of a show that i had ripped from Blu-ray and i wanted to copy
[1182.24 → 1188.56] them onto a phone and this was before i was using Plex so i had to do this manually so i got some tool that
[1188.56 → 1195.52] supported quick sync and i used it to make like 480p copies of all the episodes, and it ran many times faster than
[1195.52 → 1202.72] using CPU encode that was an example of a time that quick sync was flipping awesome the quality not as good
[1202.72 → 1208.72] but boy was it ever done fast and given that i was going to be watching it on a phone i didn't care
[1208.72 → 1216.08] and that's an example of a time that a mob that's where that's an illustration of what i mean by
[1216.72 → 1222.40] fixed function hardware being great for like a mobile optimized experience but not necessarily the best
[1222.40 → 1230.88] thing for desktop or laptop I'm not saying it's bad in fact i never said in the video i never said it
[1230.88 → 1238.00] was going to be bad i just said this is a lot of nonsense this is a lot of hand waving without any
[1238.00 → 1243.76] substance and i don't like that, and we're going to have to wait until we get the product
[1248.24 → 1251.84] are you muted are you just not talking one sec oh okay all right
[1251.84 → 1263.44] so you know Abdul quiz says Linus can't wait for you to take back your words what words would I take
[1263.44 → 1272.24] back that was my point earlier check disk i didn't check what sorry check discord really quick oh sure yeah
[1272.24 → 1285.76] uh i didn't uh i didn't actually say that it was bad i just had i tend to lean towards skepticism
[1286.32 → 1295.20] whenever i am not given concrete data that is my tendency, and it also speaks a lot in my mind to the
[1295.20 → 1301.20] confidence that a brand has about their new product it tends to be that when they get really specific i mean
[1301.20 → 1307.84] a perfect example of this is NVIDIA when they launched their RTX 3000 series they got real
[1307.84 → 1315.76] specific about what was good about these things and why they were going to be the absolute harbinger of
[1315.76 → 1321.76] embarrassment for poor AMD Radeon who hadn't managed to release a decent graphics card in forever
[1321.76 → 1330.88] um it just it exudes confidence another perfect example of this is AMD's dozen 5000 i mean they
[1330.88 → 1336.32] were putting information out about these things what like a month before launch when you think
[1336.32 → 1344.00] there is any chance whatsoever that your competition has anything on you, you keep your cards real close
[1344.00 → 1350.00] to your chest and when you think that there's a chance that what you're releasing just quite frankly
[1350.00 → 1356.64] ain't that good you get real vague in your launch materials it's a pattern that I've seen time and time and
[1356.64 → 1365.12] time again so when i see it i go oh not this again all right well let's see how it goes and i find it
[1365.12 → 1376.08] very frustrating yeah I'm not super uh nose to the ground on this but i i i think it will make a lot
[1376.08 → 1385.44] more sense for people to be critical about it um like i don't know later if that makes sense so what I'll
[1385.44 → 1391.84] be doing is I'll be it's realistically it's going to be Anthony who's going to go through and evaluate
[1391.84 → 1398.00] the m1 silicon component of all of this he's far more familiar with the macOS environment in fact
[1398.00 → 1405.04] he's been writing i think basically all of our mac content for the better part of the last couple of
[1405.04 → 1413.92] years um and then as for mobile i mean this is kind of a funny thing because like Riley's been the
[1413.92 → 1420.96] guy when it comes to iPad in particular like he was the one who you know really, really pushed for
[1420.96 → 1427.44] doing more content particularly around the iPad Pro as uh well as a laptop um that's another really
[1427.44 → 1434.24] funny thing is that just because i called the new MacBook Air an iPad doesn't necessarily mean that i
[1434.24 → 1440.80] don't think that's good it's just that it's an iPad the iPad Pro is actually really sick, and we made a
[1440.80 → 1447.68] video talking about the use the argument to be made for the iPad Pro as a laptop we came away
[1447.68 → 1453.52] with very positive impressions of it so all this is an iPad Pro that has the keyboard pre-attached
[1453.52 → 1460.64] and doesn't have a touch screen a lot of people seem to interpret my tone which yeah arguably probably
[1460.64 → 1465.92] could have been more positive but i was in a pretty irate mood because of the way that apple was
[1465.92 → 1472.48] sort of being vague and apple about it um i think a lot of people basically took my words and twisted
[1472.48 → 1479.60] them into something that they were not i said yeah it's an iPad, and it fundamentally is it's an iPad
[1479.60 → 1487.60] with a higher thermal target um and that's fine we already said that's a pretty good experience so and
[1487.60 → 1493.44] higher thermal targets can take a lot or can change a lot sorry absolutely as we've seen in the past some
[1493.44 → 1497.84] of these devices are like pretty significantly sometimes throttled not always especially with
[1497.84 → 1504.72] modern processors that do a perfect job of balancing their power and turning up you know one
[1504.72 → 1513.28] or even just or two or even just one core to get things done in a really snappy fashion um absolutely
[1514.00 → 1519.28] all right so i guess that's pretty much all i have to say about that let's see if anyone's uh anyone in
[1519.28 → 1528.48] float plane looking after everything yeah okay nothing else to really say about it, I'm really
[1528.48 → 1536.00] looking forward to checking them out i I'm hoping for the best but i think that it's going to be very
[1536.00 → 1542.96] very difficult to recommend these things right out of the gate that's just all there is to it um it's the
[1542.96 → 1549.20] kind of thing that i almost wonder if we need to review twice and to be fair um this is another one
[1549.20 → 1555.28] where like i think people might uh grab what you just said and pull more out of it than there than
[1555.28 → 1562.88] there might be uh because you almost recommend nothing right out of the gate well yeah it's its tough
[1562.88 → 1568.40] i said forever wait for proper reviews which there aren't yet yeah but there can't be a proper
[1568.40 → 1576.56] review of something that's like not done and for another one wait for user reviews so it's really
[1576.56 → 1582.48] tough right now like apple's in an apple's in a know i don't feel too bad for them, i mean this is
[1582.48 → 1589.12] absolutely their own situation they've created um, but they're in a bit of a tough transition
[1589.12 → 1596.32] period right now i mean our review of the most recent iMac was going to be was very similar to what i think
[1596.32 → 1602.40] we're going to end up with the first Apple Silicon max where we basically said well it's the
[1602.40 → 1608.96] best iMac that you shouldn't buy, and we didn't say you shouldn't buy it because the performance is bad
[1608.96 → 1614.56] or the screen's bad or really anything i mean we did criticize the fact that the design is like
[1615.84 → 1621.84] how many years old is that shell at this point i can't remember it's like ancient the bezels
[1621.84 → 1628.72] are not looking very 2020 or even like 2018 at this point um so we did criticize that, but we said
[1628.72 → 1634.32] look the reason you shouldn't buy it is that we just don't know what's going to happen we don't
[1634.32 → 1639.44] know how long it's going to get support in future macOS updates we don't know what performance is going
[1639.44 → 1645.60] to look like for the inevitable replacements um, and we're going to have to say the same thing here
[1645.60 → 1651.20] if it was is it was me for my specific use case which is where i want 10 gigs networking
[1651.20 → 1659.04] uh in a nice compact machine that runs macOS I'd be I'd be scooping up intel based ones right and left
[1659.04 → 1665.36] to make sure that i don't freaking run out of them because apple has clearly no replacement for my use
[1665.36 → 1673.60] case at all and if your use case happens to be that you know shoot short films on your iPhone and
[1673.60 → 1679.60] you just want a like a laptop to edit them on, and then you upload them to YouTube or whatever
[1679.60 → 1686.40] Apple Silicon might be freaking perfect for you if you're a developer however, and you rely on let's
[1686.40 → 1693.20] say for example virtual hardware virtualization support i haven't actually seen apple address that
[1693.20 → 1705.76] yet does the m1 support virtualization at all uh i I'm actually I'm actually asking that question i
[1705.76 → 1714.08] legitimately don't know here we go parallels desktop virtualization features that are brought to the mac
[1714.08 → 1719.28] with the apple and more Linux virtual machine flawlessly and Apple Silicon okay let's see how
[1719.28 → 1726.00] performance is in a VM though so then would the Photoshop thing be as big of a deal it depends
[1726.00 → 1733.04] like what uh what some other people have been bringing up yeah is that you could just run it in
[1733.04 → 1743.36] Rosetta so significantly faster there let's hope so let's hope so, but we don't know we can't know until
[1743.36 → 1749.52] we try it um yeah we can't know until we try it actually i do have one more thing to say about this
[1749.52 → 1756.72] it's also been very interesting seeing people pull up geek bench as though it's like the be-all and end-all
[1756.72 → 1763.84] of performance benchmarks to indisputably prove that apple m1 silicon is the best thing it's like
[1764.64 → 1772.40] okay you know why we don't use geek bench in our reviews like unless we're working with a Mac or trying
[1772.40 → 1779.76] to do a cross-platform comparison do you have any idea why we don't do that luke Bueller no
[1780.48 → 1787.28] anyone because it's not a very good benchmark i assumed it's just not particularly meaningful it
[1787.28 → 1794.64] doesn't run for very long so it doesn't tell you anything about thermal throttling um it's no it's
[1794.64 → 1801.76] very synthetic you know it's not something that we would consider to be real world um we don't use it
[1801.76 → 1810.72] because it sucks so yeah the thing is on the pc you have tons of other benchmarking applications
[1810.72 → 1816.16] available to you that unfortunately are not mac compatible because in a lot of cases those
[1816.16 → 1821.28] workloads like whether they're cad or scientific ones or whatever the case may have just been
[1822.24 → 1828.72] well they've completely abandoned the mac because apple went so flipping long without making a decent
[1828.72 → 1835.20] mac for these people um Brandon is sending me a video right now this is interesting okay so anyway
[1835.20 → 1841.84] so that geekbench is interesting it's a data point, but it is not the be-all and end-all and so
[1841.84 → 1847.68] we don't put too much stock in it and that has always been the case the last thing is oh and
[1847.68 → 1854.80] Linus is an apple hater don't listen to him because he's an apple hater i don't hate anything, and it's really
[1854.80 → 1860.56] interesting seeing those uh conversation threads go back and forth because someone will
[1860.56 → 1867.28] say you know oh don't uh don't listen to this guy he's an apple hater and someone else will say well
[1867.28 → 1874.72] what about this very positive review he gave to apple product x y or z and the person will basically
[1874.72 → 1883.28] just go like well that doesn't count then he's then he's like he's turned he's turned you don't
[1883.28 → 1893.44] turn I'm actually surprisingly consistent if you go back i praise apple when they do things that i like
[1893.44 → 1900.24] like putting proper cooling in their products or uh including features that i think are really important
[1900.24 → 1907.52] for a long time it was hilarious watching you know people who were on Mac yeah especially back in
[1907.52 → 1913.76] the trash can days so watching people who are on Mac just have be moving footage around using like
[1913.76 → 1919.28] these thunderbolt storage enclosures and I'm looking at it going like what are you mad that's like the
[1919.28 → 1925.92] the craziest thing ever 10 gig networking is its attainable today it can be shared you can have your
[1925.92 → 1931.76] you can have your whole group working off of the same repository of data, and it's all organized and
[1931.76 → 1936.72] then you can easily back it up from one place, and they've got all these like dongles and external drives
[1936.72 → 1940.40] hanging everywhere like even at professional production houses i visited i was like what are you
[1940.40 → 1948.00] guys doing you're just you're using like thunderbolt what are you nuts um and so when apple does things
[1948.00 → 1954.80] that i think are good like adding 10 gig networking to the iPad Pro and to the Mac mini i was like good job
[1954.80 → 1962.24] apple what I'm consistent about is the things that i like and i think are good like high speed networking
[1962.24 → 1967.28] connectivity and properly cooling devices and that might not be the same as other people because i can
[1967.28 → 1974.08] i can assume quite a few people out there didn't give a damn about 10 gig networking 100 percent 100
[1974.96 → 1981.44] and power to them, but it's not that i hate apple i just hate some of the things that they do and i think
[1981.44 → 1988.40] they're bad uh, and it's much the same with pretty much anyone if they do something i think is bad I'm
[1988.40 → 1993.76] not going to like it uh there was a particularly good one where someone said like he's just like an NVIDIA
[1994.40 → 2004.48] an NVIDIA shill he never criticizes NVIDIA it's like really are you serious we're not sure if anybody
[2004.48 → 2011.20] cared about it because it's more like in the weeds on like the business end of things, but we got into
[2011.20 → 2016.00] NVIDIA's anti-competitive behaviour with their partners which is something almost nobody else is
[2016.00 → 2021.76] talking about when we reviewed the RTX 3070 because it's not good for the industry and when
[2021.76 → 2026.16] we see things that are not good for the industry we're going to call them out it doesn't matter if
[2026.16 → 2031.36] your apple or NVIDIA or whoever the case may be all right yeah i was going to say i don't think
[2031.36 → 2037.60] NVIDIA would agree with you being in an NVIDIA shill i don't think they would feel that way in my search for
[2037.60 → 2043.36] for uh negative responses to that video yeah one of the things i did was check the comments on it
[2043.36 → 2048.80] uh because that's usually a good way to find stuff and i actually didn't find much it seems mostly
[2049.44 → 2055.20] isolated to a couple video responses in twitter um but one response that i found that i thought was
[2055.68 → 2065.20] um quite funny oh I've lost it now no oh here it is um someone named radio but not spelt the way that
[2065.20 → 2071.52] AMD Radeon is spelt yeah it says Linus apple is so far behind Internet Explorer our battle shall be
[2071.52 → 2085.52] legendary what i enjoyed that that was pretty good all right okay do you get it um no what is it so
[2085.52 → 2089.84] far behind that the only thing they can like fight with right now is Internet Explorer because internet
[2089.84 → 2096.32] explorer is so far behind oh Lord well Internet Explorer is just dead, so there's that it's not
[2096.32 → 2102.08] exactly true of apple and i mean they're they're doing great in certain ways they're just not
[2102.08 → 2108.08] adapting to certain other things i don't know apple leads stuff a lot like when you see the
[2108.08 → 2113.44] headphone jack go away and like everyone laughs at them and then immediately afterwards rips it off of
[2113.44 → 2119.28] every device they possibly can like yeah i don't know display notches are another perfect example of that
[2119.28 → 2126.24] it's like you hate apple because you criticize the notch no i criticize the notch
[2126.24 → 2131.84] everywhere and i particularly criticize apple because it's their bloody fault that the entire
[2131.84 → 2138.16] industry started thinking it was acceptable to put chunks in hanging out of there to bite chunks out of
[2138.16 → 2147.68] displays i criticized Samsung for it, i criticized OnePlus for it, i would criticize anyone who releases a
[2147.68 → 2156.32] display that has a notch in it, i think it's stupid what do you want from me that has nothing to do with
[2156.32 → 2161.76] apple that has to do with apple doing something boneheaded and me being frustrated because the
[2161.76 → 2167.84] entire rest of the industry can't have a single unique thought for themselves, and they just do whatever
[2167.84 → 2176.72] apple does yep it's been happening for years um CDU Souza says Linus isn't a shill for anyone he is an intel
[2176.72 → 2183.20] fanboy though so how would you what would make you say that someone is an intel fanboy am I an intel
[2183.20 → 2190.08] fanboy because I've used almost exclusively intel for the last 10 years or so or am I just someone who knows
[2190.08 → 2198.72] how to evaluate if something performs well and used intel because i could afford it because newsflash
[2198.72 → 2206.64] I'm now running AMD in my personal system I'm now running AMD in my main server that is the backbone
[2206.64 → 2216.08] of our entire business at work AMD epic um it does you need a like do you need a stronger endorsement for AMD
[2216.08 → 2222.80] out of me like other than pro i I'm running AMD in my uh home theatre rig which is also my VR gaming rig
[2223.52 → 2231.12] like at what point does the evidence pile up, and you just have to kind of discard your hypothesis well
[2231.12 → 2236.16] how far do we have to go wrong i i i think that comment just got it wrong you're you're clearly in an
[2236.16 → 2243.20] AMD show see that's the funny one that's the funny one where you get accused of just like switching
[2243.20 → 2248.56] your shilling allegiance like no you should put AMD in everything clearly you're a shell you
[2248.56 → 2256.40] shouldn't have allegiance to any company because newsflash they don't care about you at all I'm
[2256.40 → 2262.64] sorry that's just the way it is get this you know how AMD position themselves i didn't even
[2262.64 → 2268.80] talk about this i should have I should have Anthony didn't have it in his script and i was going to like
[2268.80 → 2273.76] talk to him about it and be like we should probably put this in but i was like ah forget it no it's not
[2273.76 → 2280.24] that important but maybe i should have talked about it um AMD sort of positioned themselves as like a
[2280.24 → 2288.80] scrappy pro consumer you know uh brand uh they made this image for themselves yeah we've got free
[2288.80 → 2296.88] sync it's like free yeah NVIDIA they're bad g-sync um the truth of the matter is that AMD just didn't have
[2296.88 → 2308.56] the resources to build an ecosystem so they relied on sort of supporting this more see the thing is
[2308.56 → 2314.08] free sync is not technically the same thing as what we ultimately got which was variable refresh rate
[2314.56 → 2322.80] um free sync was a proprietary implementation of an open uh of an open technology so it was like
[2322.80 → 2330.48] sort of open but like also not quite, and it also didn't work as well so what NVIDIA did was they
[2330.48 → 2337.76] went and they went, and they invented something and AMD went yep it's its half-baked, but it's free
[2337.76 → 2345.60] we did a good job go AMD um like that's the kind of thing AMD does and as soon as AMD gets on top and
[2345.60 → 2351.44] I've already said it before but i guess I'll say it again as soon as AMD gets on top expect their behaviour
[2351.44 → 2357.12] to change because they are still a company, and they are still trying to make money that is their
[2357.12 → 2363.28] top priority as a company because without it, they will not survive, and they almost didn't and
[2363.28 → 2369.28] there are so many people at AMD that remember how hard it is to survive if you don't make any money
[2369.28 → 2378.08] so what did AMD do as soon as they had a performance lead they raised their prices what a surprise because
[2378.08 → 2384.16] you guys got to remember and there's almost no one that i know who still remains from back in those
[2384.16 → 2393.92] days, but intel didn't start the extreme edition crap that wasn't intel that was amd started it with
[2393.92 → 2403.28] the FX 51 so you can go like oh, oh AMD good guy intel bad guy but they both just want your money
[2403.28 → 2409.76] company and there are people at both of these companies all of these companies there are people
[2409.76 → 2415.84] that legitimately care people that care about the consumer people that will actually see a concern
[2415.84 → 2422.88] in a tweet or in an email and go wow i need to fix this because people's experience using these products
[2422.88 → 2432.24] matters to me and i take pride in my work but as an organization you can't make any such assumption
[2432.24 → 2439.20] it's just ridiculous oh Muhammad says you show them your Apple Watch
[2442.00 → 2450.32] i wear this because i hate every android wearable and i wear it just to be a troll I'm literally an apple
[2450.32 → 2450.80] customer
[2454.64 → 2459.44] i sent you a bunch of the uh branding and marketing that was used
[2459.44 → 2466.24] uh for a little while therefore AMD i found this to be kind of insane uh and they actually
[2466.24 → 2473.68] at pax they actually had people walking around yeah with these protest signs uh with like different
[2473.68 → 2481.68] chants and stuff as if they were actually like staging a protest um join the uh you have dragged
[2481.68 → 2488.00] a URL is this even going to work let's see if this works hey there you go join the radio rebellion
[2488.00 → 2492.40] you should be able to just click on them and then click open original it should open in your browser
[2492.40 → 2502.00] control your own performance better red silence us as if they're being like thought controlled or like there's no free speech
[2502.00 → 2510.00] free our async yeah sure VR is not just for the one percent join the radio rebellion no more rules control your own performance
[2510.00 → 2515.12] control your own performance do you guys imagine for a second that like the marketing suits that come
[2515.12 → 2519.92] up with these campaigns are any different from the marketing suits at intel or apple who come up with
[2519.92 → 2524.96] these campaigns and slogans they might know more about their own hardware it's just a brand
[2526.00 → 2534.88] it's just a brand sorry i had to take that shot all right so i think I've exhausted everything that i have to
[2534.88 → 2543.20] say about that whole thing if it is what it is, and we'll, we'll see how it goes i think these first gen ones
[2543.20 → 2550.16] are probably going to be quickly forgotten and i think apple probably knows it um they've done it
[2550.16 → 2555.92] before, and they'll who knows they'll probably do it again um no i have one more thing to say and that's
[2555.92 → 2561.92] not just me like hating on apple and saying a first gen apple product is bad as a general rule if for is
[2561.92 → 2568.96] it's for real work i tend to avoid first gen products we almost always run a generation behind
[2568.96 → 2573.60] for our editing workstations at work it's not that we don't need the performance we've been running 8k
[2573.60 → 2579.04] footage for a long time now we're moving to 12k very soon we definitely need the performance but what
[2579.04 → 2585.04] we don't like is dealing with early teething issues and nobody is immune to them including apple they've
[2585.04 → 2593.84] had examples of great product launches AirPods was a perfect example and AirPods pros there is no doubt
[2593.84 → 2601.68] whatsoever that i am an AirPods Pro evangelist i freaking love these things i use them literally
[2601.68 → 2608.00] every single day even when i don't listen to music i use my AirPods pros because the noise cancellation is
[2608.56 → 2614.00] freaking fantastic i just use it so that i can focus like these things have changed my life
[2614.00 → 2618.16] and I've gotten messages from other people telling me the same thing i got this wonderful
[2618.16 → 2625.04] message from someone saying uh Linus uh you know I'm not really an apple kind of guy, and you shouldn't
[2625.04 → 2628.96] be an anything kind of guy or anything not kind of guy you should keep an open mind is what you should
[2628.96 → 2633.76] do, but that's not what the message said the message said look I'm not really an apple kind of guy but
[2633.76 → 2641.04] based on your excellent review of the AirPods pros i bought them and i am the type of person who tends to
[2641.04 → 2648.96] get overloaded in sort of overwhelming environments like uh like a sensory overload type of
[2648.96 → 2655.28] person um you know i don't remember if they actually used a word like Asperger's or autism, but you could
[2655.28 → 2660.48] you could tell they were trying to say in their own way that they were somewhere on the spectrum and
[2660.48 → 2666.80] they had a really hard time in loud and overwhelming situations with crowds and lots of people, and they were
[2666.80 → 2672.16] just like buying AirPods pros based on your recommendation talking about using them
[2672.16 → 2677.84] this way changed my life it reduced my anxiety it made it so that when I'm out in public places like
[2677.84 → 2683.92] in the mall i can actually enjoy them now because the way that i use them a lot of the time is I'll
[2683.92 → 2688.64] have the noise and the noise cancellation active even when I'm conducting a conversation with someone
[2688.64 → 2694.88] because what it does is some people tend to be like too loud like particularly my kids i will be at home
[2694.88 → 2700.24] with my AirPods pros in with my noise cancellation active because honestly sometimes I've just had a
[2700.24 → 2707.60] long day, and it takes the edge off, and it's nice same thing out in public I've even used them uh in
[2707.60 → 2715.92] situations like where there's very loud music playing like in a like in an um like a live music venue
[2716.56 → 2720.32] even certain restaurants and stuff make it like difficult to talk to each other
[2720.32 → 2726.00] so because it's so loud the bottom of the line is you can love a product, but you should never love
[2726.00 → 2734.08] a company because they will use that love, and they will you so i uh i have a very similar apple story
[2734.08 → 2742.48] really um where i have like kind of weird ears and like most in-ear headphones don't stay in my
[2742.48 → 2749.28] freaking ears' oh that's true i remember that like the old mobile um apple headphones that were
[2749.28 → 2756.00] recorded were like the only uh like wired individual uh why can't the earbuds they were the only earbuds
[2756.00 → 2760.56] that i could actually like use because the in-ears would always fall out and those were shaped more
[2760.56 → 2767.52] to the actual ear so it would hold on better um and i loved those and then i got a pixel 2 no
[2767.52 → 2774.32] headphone jack and I'm like well I'm screwed now but i just got AirPods not pros i don't know but
[2774.32 → 2778.80] they probably wouldn't work pretty great uh, but they probably wouldn't work for me right because your
[2778.80 → 2784.56] ear canal issue yep but i got AirPods in general, and they're freaking awesome i love them
[2784.56 → 2789.44] i use them all the time they're great uh memorial has a super chat in here I've heard apple makes
[2789.44 → 2794.80] chrome books now you can't run real apps so they run mobile apps you know what that's a good point
[2794.80 → 2802.32] sort of so because apple has the clout to work with developers and get real apps developed for the m1 chip
[2802.32 → 2809.28] I'm not expecting it to be quite that bad or take quite that long to transition, but it also is a
[2809.28 → 2815.84] valid criticism of what apple's doing here that i have been very consistent about i have consistently
[2815.84 → 2821.44] said oh chrome books well they're nice as long as everything you do is in a web browser, and you don't
[2821.44 → 2828.32] ever need to like to do something unexpected uh you know there are all kinds of just like random
[2828.32 → 2834.64] applications that i will run in my not daily life but certainly in my yearly life and just
[2834.64 → 2841.36] outright not being able to do it is a bummer that's something that i hope that i hope apple handles well
[2841.36 → 2848.96] with Rosetta 2 um so no they're not as bad as chrome books, but they could have some of the growing
[2848.96 → 2855.20] pains of chrome books which is something again that i have been completely consistent about i didn't like it
[2855.20 → 2862.64] when Google did it and now I'm going to be skeptical when apple does it nothing wrong with it all right
[2862.64 → 2869.52] let's move on let's talk about the PlayStation freaking five and the Xbox series you want to do
[2869.52 → 2876.56] a sponsor spot you might want to oh what the hell have we been talking about this for we've been talking
[2876.56 → 2885.76] about this for 40 minutes oh no okay um well that's problematic we got a big problem today Luke we got
[2885.76 → 2892.88] a problem um can I tell you about my problem yes my problem is that i didn't copy over the assets for
[2892.88 → 2899.44] the sponsor spots okay i can do something um yeah do you want to do you want to do a topic that doesn't
[2899.44 → 2904.48] involve me real quick i mean these are all great topics there are some great topics i mean still one of
[2904.48 → 2908.64] them but I'll leave I'll leave the other ones, so the new consoles have launched that's exciting
[2908.64 → 2913.28] that's fun there are some issues with both the Xbox and the PS5 which i will wait to discuss
[2914.00 → 2918.64] until Linus can jump on them no I'm just going to come right back i have no way to fix this
[2918.64 → 2923.28] my work machine is down because my office is torn apart and being used as a set right now
[2923.28 → 2927.76] can someone email it to you that has access uh it's after work hours i tend not to like to bother
[2927.76 → 2931.84] people tend not to like to bother people so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to
[2931.84 → 2938.56] make paper signs I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm ms painting it I'm ms painting it so uh beautiful
[2938.56 → 2944.56] here we go ladies and gentlemen uh i just gotta see the creation process i have to no because i don't
[2944.56 → 2950.08] know what i got on my screen right now I'm just gonna i got you know i got the know early
[2950.08 → 2954.32] early versions of some of my only fans content that I'll be uploading soon i don't want people
[2954.32 → 2959.12] to see them before i photoshop off all of my thigh pimples and stuff like that yeah good call good
[2959.12 → 2964.72] call gotta get those thigh pimples um okay so what I'm going to jump into first however is that
[2964.72 → 2972.72] there's a new data usage record in the UK that kind of coincides with the console launch um some of
[2972.72 → 2978.88] these games are freaking huge people have been Memling about how big uh modern warfare is for a long time
[2978.88 → 2987.60] but it sounds like even if you had the disc there were 65 gigabytes of updates um once you 65 gigs of
[2987.60 → 2997.52] updates and Call of Duty uh black ops Cold War the preload for it is 130 gigabytes destiny 2 is 65
[2997.52 → 3004.72] gigabytes assassin's creed Valhalla is 60 gigabytes so if you had you know four games that you wanted to
[3004.72 → 3012.00] download, and they happen to be those and one of them was only an update you're looking at a lot of a lot
[3012.00 → 3021.28] of bandwidth uh so the traffic uh the traffic on provider BT uh peaked at 18 terabits per second
[3021.28 → 3028.72] their previous record was 17.5 which apparently coincided with the war zone season 4 launch
[3029.76 → 3036.80] and it is 30 higher than average just because of people downloading games maybe we're not ready for an
[3036.80 → 3044.40] entirely diskless future yet Luke i mean do you ever consider that like dang that's freaking crazy
[3045.68 → 3050.96] and i i will fall back i have been pointing this out for a long time you and your physical
[3050.96 → 3058.16] data can you nerd you nerd what they have no starling's going to save us all we're gonna
[3058.16 → 3064.08] download we're going to download games on Starlink as long as there's only a few of you in that area yeah
[3064.08 → 3069.84] exactly if you're like by yourself way in the middle of nowhere yeah it's going to be great um
[3070.56 → 3076.80] I'm actually really excited for Starlink but anyway uh yeah like it's you could very well if
[3076.80 → 3080.64] you bought one of these new consoles, and you didn't have discs, and you were downloading games that you
[3080.64 → 3086.80] already owned yeah you should be able to do that you could be waiting a week easy like easy and you
[3086.80 → 3092.56] could be data capped yep like to the point where you might have to just stop downloading your games
[3092.56 → 3100.72] and just wait until next month to rancid it's rancid Luke maybe we'll get maybe we'll get um
[3101.36 → 3108.00] like libraries we'll start stocking like install discs for games okay glass half full glass half
[3108.00 → 3113.60] full okay ready Luke glass half full there's not that many exclusive launch titles for the new consoles
[3113.60 → 3120.72] anyway right but so you don't have to buy that many games okay sure you don't have to buy that many games
[3120.72 → 3125.52] but you're probably not leaving your old console plugged in and playing off of it you got your new
[3125.52 → 3132.40] shiny toy yeah that's true remove the old shiny toy redownload the stuff that you want to play it's not
[3132.40 → 3138.48] necessarily even buying new content because yeah i mean the list of games that i just said two old
[3138.48 → 3145.84] games one game that isn't released yet and only one game that just came out um but like there if you
[3145.84 → 3150.96] were playing Call of Duty modern warfare on your old console, and you got the new console, and you're
[3150.96 → 3155.36] all excited about black ops coming out you're probably going to download the current modern warfare well
[3155.36 → 3163.76] you're going to try it might take you a bit just like it took me a bit to make these amazing sponsor
[3163.76 → 3168.80] lower thirds first up is a new sponsor jump cloud
[3168.80 → 3175.92] jump cloud woo look at that jump cloud offers a cloud directory platform that gives users a single
[3175.92 → 3182.48] identity for their email apps networks and even their work device whether it's mac windows or Linux
[3182.48 → 3187.52] jump cloud gives it admins a single pane of glass to configure and secure those devices
[3187.52 → 3194.00] set policies for MFA full disk encryption screen savers and more and even offers remote onboarding and
[3194.00 → 3200.40] off-boarding so it can go from hours to under five minutes pretty important in pandemic land i mean
[3200.40 → 3206.64] trying to like to get someone out of your organization and devices and stuff like that when they're like
[3206.64 → 3211.68] remote that's that's kind of that's actually kind of scary that's something i never really like
[3211.68 → 3217.20] thought about like we don't really terminate a lot of people on bad terms so it's not really something
[3217.20 → 3221.92] i think about but if you were doing that, and they've just like got these devices, and you have no way of
[3221.92 → 3227.28] administrating them that that would be kind of sucky jump cloud puts zero trust security within
[3227.28 → 3231.60] reach for organizations of any size and reimagines the relationship between the user identity their
[3231.60 → 3236.96] work device and their access to resources access is securely granted based on a trusted identity
[3236.96 → 3242.16] trusted device and trusted network so if you're looking for a directory that supports heterogeneous OS's
[3242.16 → 3247.76] or you just need SSO MDM LDAP MFA or all of the above jump cloud will make your job easier
[3247.76 → 3256.72] try it out for yourself at jumpcloud.com the show is also brought to you today by here we go uh yes
[3256.72 → 3266.56] i would like to remove don't steal series the steel series Xerox 3 wireless is ultra light at just 66
[3266.56 → 3276.96] grams dang that is really light like what even is that that's like hold on a minute 66 grams
[3277.60 → 3287.20] so that's 0.06 of a kilo which is 2.2 pounds Luke help me out here how much is that in pounds
[3287.20 → 3293.04] sorry say again uh 66 grams so it's one of the lightest mice available using their quantum wireless
[3293.04 → 3298.96] 2.0 for nearly zero latency it's 2.4 gigahertz, or you can flip it over to Bluetooth if you're willing
[3298.96 → 3305.76] to give up some latency for compatibility it boasts 200 hours of battery life USB fast charging with 40
[3305.76 → 3311.20] hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging and their aqua barrier technology making it the first
[3311.20 → 3317.20] ip54 dust and splash resistant gaming mouse i don't know about you guys but i definitely need a splash
[3317.20 → 3322.72] resistant mouse if you know what i mean go to steel series.com Xerox to check out the Xerox 3 wireless
[3322.72 → 3332.32] today what is 66 grams and pounds it is uh 0.145505 pounds thank you that was exactly the number of
[3332.32 → 3336.72] decimals that i needed i knew you had my back and the show is also brought to you by ridge wallet now
[3336.72 → 3341.20] i have a normal ridge wallet lower third but in the interest of being consistent i decided to make them
[3341.20 → 3346.40] a ms paint one as well stop carrying around pointless items in your pocket like receipts old hotel room keys
[3346.40 → 3351.76] or spent gift cards ridge wallet helps you carry less they use two metal plates that are bound by a
[3351.76 → 3357.44] strong elastic so you can keep your cards tightly together but still accessible they're RFID blocking
[3357.44 → 3362.32] and they offer a lifetime guarantee with ridge wallets available in aluminum carbon fibre and
[3362.32 → 3367.12] titanium they don't just sell wallets they have battery banks bags smartphone covers and more and
[3367.12 → 3373.36] you can use offer code Linus to save 10 on everything at ridge.com slash Linus
[3374.56 → 3379.44] also are you is that all the sponsor spots that's it that's all okay i learned something
[3379.44 → 3384.72] what you learned while you're doing those i was a little bit wrong potentially i don't know
[3384.72 → 3388.88] exactly how i worded it but I'll better make an apology video here it comes ladies and gentlemen
[3388.88 → 3397.76] Luke's first apology video and the years the white doors um so i uh thanks for that uh apparently i was
[3397.76 → 3402.32] i was talking about how like you'd have to download your old games right yes apparently you can
[3402.32 → 3408.48] data transfer over Wi-Fi and is it the same game i guess there'd be a lot of shared assets that's pretty cool
[3408.48 → 3415.76] and you can transfer your save files that way too over LAN again so it doesn't have to like cloud sync stuff
[3415.76 → 3422.24] like that you can transfer your your your games and their saves over Wi-Fi it seems with both of them
[3422.24 → 3427.84] i haven't looked into uh like exact feature parody across the board but i know with the Xbox again
[3427.84 → 3437.20] PlayStation might be able to do this i don't know but with the Xbox uh if your like can't have them both plugged in and on Wi-Fi at the same time for some reason or something you could use an external hard drive
[3437.20 → 3459.20] and you can back the stuff up onto the external hard drive and then load it onto the series x with the external hard drive, so there is there are multiple ways to do that and i would highly recommend that you do that instead of trying to download all of those things that is a much better way of doing it and I'm very happy that both consoles uh support at least some form of doing that
[3459.20 → 3461.20] some form of doing that
[3461.20 → 3471.20] okay hold on a second we might have one Dave lee hanging around in our chat here what is Mr Dave lee doing in the chat
[3471.20 → 3485.20] sorry if i said Wi-Fi cable it's late it's late where you're from sir i think maybe you should go get some sleep Mr Dave lee is he here to roast you about apple stuff he wants me to 1v1 him rust
[3485.20 → 3499.20] oh dude i can't uh i don't know if i can uh i don't know if i can turn down a 1v1 me rust request unfortunately unless i was hallucinating I'm pretty sure uh Mr Dave lee and i played apex
[3499.20 → 3513.20] Mr Dave lee and i played apex a while back and that was actually super fun i am uh i am I unfortunately appear to have misplaced his phone number which is a little bit embarrassing
[3513.20 → 3521.20] uh so Dave if you still have mine feel free to give me a call you want to talk you want to talk m1 on the wan show i think people haven't had enough of it by this point
[3521.20 → 3527.20] actually JK they probably have but I'm I'm down I'm down dude I'd love to I'd love to hear
[3527.20 → 3537.20] yeah i think that would be that would be awesome I'm down dude uh why don't we talk about the consoles in the meantime because I'm actually not sure if oh you know what oh i do have him uh i do have him here
[3537.20 → 3543.20] all right you should also be able to exchange information on Twitter
[3543.20 → 3553.20] yeah that's that's what that's what occurred to me and i just confirmed i do in fact have him on origin so i must not have been hallucinating we must have actually done that
[3553.20 → 3561.20] all right that was fun um so oh never mind oh we got a call from uh Toronto Ontario Canada i heard those guys
[3561.20 → 3567.20] here we go i heard they think they're the centre of the universe but uh they didn't realize that that's actually New York they're just like
[3567.20 → 3581.20] discount New York hey dude all right how you uh how you're doing there bud I'm good I've never actually watched your Sancho like live I've seen it I've seen it uh
[3581.20 → 3611.18] I've seen it I've seen it uh like recorded a few times like here and there but I've never actually clicked on a live show before so you come right on my show, and you disrespect me like that right out of the gate you know what i should have known this is coming i should have known this is coming the west is always forgotten by you people oh my god yeah i actually didn't watch your show until the very tail end of it like i think uh john he tweeted it that you're doing the show live and i was like man i have to see what he's got to say but I'm one i missed it though I'll be serious if there is's anything I've been
[3611.18 → 3618.18] anything you said i need like a second recap all right do you hate it or do you or do you like it, i don't anything if it's not out
[3618.18 → 3629.18] oh, oh you think it's actually not out okay i if i don't have it in my hands if it's not it's not out okay, okay it's not out okay so i think the review embargoes go up next week but I'm surprised that you don't see the
[3629.18 → 3636.18] i mean okay look i guess you don't love apple stuff i feel you there I'm okay hold on a second hold on because i covered this earlier what don't I love about apple stuff what do you know do you know that i daily drive apple products okay an i think the big one for both of us they're either lack of
[3636.18 → 3643.18] right to repair or the elements of that that stuff sucks it does their pricing i don't even think the pricing is that bad
[3643.18 → 3658.18] so i think the pricing is that bad yeah i don't think the pricing is that bad so i think the big one for both of us they're either lack of right to repair or the elements of that that stuff sucks it does
[3658.18 → 3671.18] either pricing i don't even think the pricing is that bad, but you don't hate Tesla and they fight against right to repair i don't love their pricing let's be real here
[3671.18 → 3683.18] well hold on a second i yeah i how did you just flip the script on me because here i am defending apple the iPhone SE is a compelling product and let's look at the smartwatch market
[3683.18 → 3695.18] okay the new smartwatch the new see smartwatch is basically no compromises as long as you're one of those people who doesn't believe that an Apple Watch should be a watch first and foremost and that it's okay for it to not have an always on display
[3695.18 → 3710.18] well compared to any android device it's its a way better value sure so in 2020 they brought out like two good products two reasonably priced products i would agree with you there but for the vast majority of their company history they've just been pretty expensive
[3710.18 → 3722.18] what competes with AirPods Pro i mean you got Sennheiser they're even more expensive no I'm talking with active noise cancellation that is actually good and doesn't put a bunch of pressure on your eardrums
[3722.18 → 3735.18] then i would say no but I'm not I'm not a silicon tip guy i like hard tip and there's so many good hard tip earbuds out there that's fair that's fair anyway you were saying that i don't love apple
[3735.18 → 3763.18] i don't love apple okay the only thing i the only thing i saw was your uh what's it called the regular video not this beginning of the show sure i watched a few minutes of your um your m1 like pre preview or kind of early thoughts on it sure do you feel like you don't you don't believe in it, i don't believe i don't believe in that's what i don't believe in i don't believe in
[3763.18 → 3785.18] i don't believe in unlabelled graphs yeah, but everybody does it NVIDIA no they don't they actually do not know come on nothing they actually don't they actually don't they actually don't I'm serious Dave do you watch NVIDIA keynotes i do but if you looked at the if you looked at uh apple's graphs
[3785.18 → 3795.34] uh huh look at the fine print they did actually label later the CPU later it wasn't later yes it was but i went on their website and i was like this was actually they specify the specific CPU
[3795.34 → 3813.18] yes later and a lot of those quote unquote specific CPUs just say like core i3 they don't say the actual model, and they don't specify what device it's actually installed in which matters a lot if there's anything apple's taught us over the years it's that a poor thermal solution can really hamper the performance of a given chip
[3813.18 → 3839.18] no okay i agree with you there listen I'm just saying that they delivered there was like confidence in their delivery i genuinely think that this is going to be a legitimate like it's going to be a thing for them okay you are about to you're about to get wrecked because apple also confidently delivered unapologetic plastic
[3839.18 → 3848.30] unapologetically plastic was the original iPhone SE
[3850.06 → 3855.02] that's what their phrasing was dude do you even cover apple
[3856.94 → 3864.14] what unapologetically plastic what do you have on that that was how johnny I've described the iPhone SE
[3864.14 → 3878.86] unapologetically, unapologetically plastic or whatever his accent sounds like i don't I don't remember it was hilarious it was so bad apple sells anything no matter how bad it is like it's the best thing since sliced bread
[3878.86 → 3886.22] and what i get frustrated with is them being even more vague than usual they were even more vague than usual
[3886.22 → 3895.34] and people just ate it up no vagueness should not be accepted okay i think that the reason why i think
[3895.34 → 3903.74] their angle on this sorry 5c not the original see sorry 5c oh the five yeah my bad yeah yeah
[3903.74 → 3907.90] yeah, yeah okay i was like the SC was plastic i didn't realize what we talked about the front okay
[3907.90 → 3915.18] nope no SC's a SC's great the reason why i think they went on a bizarre angle on this in terms of
[3915.18 → 3919.82] like how they pitched the performance especially for someone like you who's if you get sweaty with this
[3919.82 → 3923.82] stuff right you know this stuff intimately you look at these charts, and you're like what the f like this
[3923.82 → 3932.06] means nothing to me, i really think that all the performance metrics like i thought as you know it's its not the
[3932.06 → 3940.46] way that it's not that traditional performance can be looked at we don't even have the ability like
[3940.46 → 3947.82] even reviewers like right we don't even have the ability to kind of test new m1 stuff the way that we
[3947.82 → 3953.42] traditionally would then they should shut up and not talk about it that was simple performance yeah
[3954.22 → 3959.50] then they should focus on real world performance they should focus on things, and they did do some of
[3959.50 → 3967.34] it and i did acknowledge it things like instant on that is a performance metric absolutely but to
[3967.34 → 3972.54] imagine for a second that there's not going to be any way to objectively evaluate this stuff i think is
[3972.54 → 3978.62] foolish of course there will be there just aren't really very many good tools on the mac exactly and
[3978.62 → 3984.22] a big problem we're going to have is that if we don't have applications to run, and we don't have
[3984.22 → 3989.74] benchmarking tools we're just taking apple's freaking word for it, and they can't even put
[3989.74 → 3997.10] numbers on their graph i mean do they are they even able to measure it I'm sure they can but why but
[3997.10 → 4001.74] they can't well i mean like let's say why are you sure like i mean because I'm sure they have tooled that
[4001.74 → 4007.18] we will never have access to well why don't they provide them then you know what NVIDIA did recently
[4007.18 → 4012.70] this was incredible so NVIDIA so well for the people who didn't for the people who didn't see it
[4012.70 → 4019.10] NVIDIA released their own internal tools for measuring your click to photon latency which is
[4019.10 → 4025.50] one of the key measures of the smoothness of your gaming experience as well as their own internal
[4025.50 → 4031.74] tools for measuring the isolated power consumption of a graphics card they released these tools why
[4031.74 → 4036.86] because they were confident that if reviewers were equipped with proper tools their products would
[4036.86 → 4044.46] come out on top that's why NVIDIA released those tools and AMD didn't AMD has those tools they didn't
[4044.46 → 4051.90] release them okay but okay listen I'm not saying that apple that I'm one is amazing i really am not
[4051.90 → 4059.42] well you can't because you think you don't have it yet unless you do right but i do think based on the
[4059.42 → 4066.06] very early kind of data we have on this stuff right now it feels way more promising than anything we've
[4066.06 → 4072.70] seen from like you know uh Surface Pro x with their arm uh implementation and same with like
[4072.70 → 4078.38] the Qualcomm stuff but i didn't even cover Surface Pro x no, no that's what I'm saying like i have
[4078.38 → 4084.30] right I've I've reviewed Surface Pro x I've reviewed like the sure arm laptops those are so bad it's like
[4084.30 → 4090.94] these things shouldn't even be on the market but i feel like this apple version of if it's it has
[4090.94 → 4096.70] potential it legitimately has potential to me so it sounds to me like you and i are 100 on the same page
[4096.70 → 4102.54] we're totally on the same page because so you evaluate you i was just joking with the one
[4102.54 → 4109.18] view run west so you oh no i know that's a meme, so my point is you reviewed those products and
[4109.18 → 4115.34] you said these are so bad they shouldn't be on the market i did you one better i didn't even review
[4115.34 → 4121.66] them they weren't even worth me picking up because i already knew the answer and i was like yeah nobody
[4121.66 → 4127.98] should care about these they don't even deserve the coverage on my channel that bad i i i wanted them to
[4127.98 → 4133.98] be good particularly Microsoft's version of it like if i thought of windows you know they had this whole
[4133.98 → 4139.02] thing with like they worked with arms to develop this chip, and they're like i believed it you know
[4139.02 → 4144.78] what i think I'm just more jaded i think I'm just more jaded than you dude because like i used the
[4144.78 → 4151.74] surface RT right at launch right at launch the first, and it was you got fooled it was utterly worthless i
[4151.74 → 4157.82] you know what as part of my preparation for this wan show i actually went back and i watched my original
[4157.82 → 4166.22] video of the surface arm version the first surface and i was like okay am I just being totally unfair
[4166.22 → 4172.30] to apple like was I way more positive about it when Microsoft did it and i went back and i watched it
[4172.30 → 4177.98] and went yeah i was more positive about it but i don't think it's because it was Microsoft and because
[4177.98 → 4186.30] it was apple because I'm just as down on arm on Windows devices these days as i am about uh more down
[4186.30 → 4190.22] actually compared to how i feel about what it's going to be like on the mac because i do think
[4190.22 → 4194.38] apple will figure it out which if you'd watch to the end of my video you would know that i did say
[4194.94 → 4202.06] um there are too many ads dude it's it was like it was Russian dolls of ads it's just that I'll own
[4202.06 → 4207.42] that I'll own that I'm not even going to apologize for it, you should subscribe on float plane no ads
[4207.90 → 4213.02] yeah so hey Dave since uh since I've got you um do you want to go ahead and subscribe on float plane it's
[4213.02 → 4218.54] just five dollars a month you get uh early access as well as exclusive behind the scenes that might
[4218.54 → 4222.70] give you some ideas for how to run your own operation over there to your channel
[4222.70 → 4228.62] to your channel yeah yeah yeah go ahead it's five bucks I'll do it there you go
[4228.62 → 4233.18] say see look at that there you go ads work to all the listeners i actually genuinely believe
[4233.18 → 4237.82] flow plane is pretty cool well thank you i personally can't do it but I've I've scoped around on there
[4237.82 → 4243.18] and for the content creators that are on there they're actually on there it's an awesome service
[4243.18 → 4248.46] well thank you appreciate that so i think that's the difference is I'm just more jaded than you
[4248.46 → 4254.46] we're both in exactly the same position thinking that apple's implementation is definitely going to
[4254.46 → 4262.30] be better than what Microsoft and Samsung Qualcomm and whoever else have done um right and we both need
[4262.30 → 4267.66] to reserve judgment for when we can actually try the new macs and see what software compatibility is
[4267.66 → 4274.70] like and performance for non-native software and uh that's all that matters and i heard that you
[4274.70 → 4278.94] actually didn't watch your video yet i was planning to though because i heard you're on the same page
[4278.94 → 4284.86] as me about these things ultimately getting abandoned that m1's going to get dumped yep
[4287.50 → 4292.14] I'm definitely not on the same page with you there really so you think they're going to get a full
[4292.14 → 4299.02] you think they're going to get a full support cycle these first gen devices if they don't
[4299.02 → 4303.66] think about how much like i know apple's rich think about how many billions they've sunk on this
[4303.66 → 4306.46] right now oh no that's not what I'm talking about that's not what I'm talking about no, no
[4306.46 → 4314.86] they're sticking with arm i mean m1 oh yeah oh dude I'm i 100 yeah i would be surprised if they go
[4314.86 → 4321.50] like six months it is the worst oh they'll go more than six months i mean even Apple Watch Series
[4321.50 → 4328.22] zero got a couple of watch OS updates, and they called it series zero they literally revisionist
[4328.22 → 4333.90] history got rid of it series zero like i thought you meant when there's going to be like a next iteration
[4333.90 → 4339.02] of it oh no they will absolutely have a higher performance chip coming and honestly i think part
[4339.02 → 4344.78] of why i was so disappointed was because i don't pay much attention to rumours because i just i get tired
[4344.78 → 4352.38] of it and i was expecting i was expecting more like you know a 12 core or a 16 core chip yeah
[4352.38 → 4357.98] something massive i was expecting if they were going to put it in something that they called MacBook Pro
[4358.62 → 4365.82] i was expecting it to be not an iPad and there's nothing wrong with the iPad i get you, but it's not
[4365.82 → 4372.46] a MacBook Pro exactly that yeah all right well you know what i absolutely love that you called into
[4372.46 → 4378.22] the show today we never do guests anymore this was an absolute blast uh uh dave lee is brought
[4378.22 → 4383.26] to you by my iPhone 12 Pro here by the way ladies and gentlemen just holding this up for the camera
[4383.26 → 4389.42] mister i hate apple so much i can't even you know touch their products apparently um do you like their
[4389.42 → 4396.78] phone this one it's fine it's a phone uh i love the HDR video recording um i touched on that in my in
[4396.78 → 4403.90] my unboxing of it i was absolutely blown the way it's pretty fire it's unreal everything else about
[4403.90 → 4409.58] it is like yeah it's definitely a phone well i wouldn't call it mediocre it's fine it's just there's
[4409.58 → 4416.22] a lot of good phones now like exactly it's hard to compel people to upgrade their iPhones these days
[4416.22 → 4425.50] why upgrade it's not like it's not like the flat edges Linus what haven't you seen the flat edges I've
[4425.50 → 4432.86] seen that they're sharp they're not even comfortable i don't even like it better it's fine it's fine i
[4432.86 → 4439.34] guess I'm kidding all right thanks for calling in dude cool you have a wonderful evening you too good
[4439.34 → 4448.78] all right take care all right so basically it sounds like we're on the same page
[4451.02 → 4458.78] i think a lot of times situations like that just require um immediate back and forth discussion voice
[4458.78 → 4463.42] calls that type of stuff and i think that was really cool I'm really stoked I'm going to let you
[4463.42 → 4471.02] finish but did you just actually say that to me what do you mean do you know ladies and gentlemen
[4471.66 → 4483.02] if i had a dollar for every time Luke gave me an excuse for something not getting done not getting
[4483.02 → 4489.26] done or not being able to figure something out because he hadn't heard back from an email yet
[4489.26 → 4497.26] i wouldn't even have to make videos any more okay the number of times i have told that guy pick
[4497.26 → 4506.22] up a phone and just talk to people to get the problem solved oh i love it i love it i do the same thing
[4506.22 → 4512.38] now I've I've adopted totally, totally on board it because it works and like yeah you know what sometimes
[4512.38 → 4520.06] it can be uncomfortable, but the uncomfortable portion usually lasts for like five to 30 seconds
[4520.06 → 4527.74] way less painful and then and then you're almost always much more like actually functioning together
[4527.74 → 4533.58] as a unit to solve or discuss a problem like exactly like it's you move so much quicker the first
[4533.58 → 4538.06] hello can be kind of rough because you can hear it in their voice sometimes like oh why is this
[4538.06 → 4542.06] person talking to me, i don't want to talk on the phone right now or whatever but then yeah you transmit
[4542.06 → 4548.46] across that it's important and usually people jump up so i don't know yeah you got me for sure hilarious
[4548.46 → 4555.26] to hear you say that team now for sure well I'm yeah oh god yeah oh no i was trying to, and you know
[4555.26 → 4560.78] this i was trying to hunt for a call in like that whole show um and then Dave just appears out of
[4560.78 → 4570.06] nowhere Dave showed up right in the chat it was beautifully unapologetically a phone call yep um so we've
[4570.06 → 4575.02] kind of run out of time here ladies and gentlemen which is really unfortunate because there is a
[4575.02 → 4579.90] bunch of really cool stuff we had wanted to talk about today should we blow through a few of these
[4579.90 → 4586.78] topics yeah yeah um so uh the new consoles have launched there are some issues some Xbox owners
[4586.78 → 4591.90] are complaining about weird noises possibly from fan blades clipping on something um some have issues
[4591.90 → 4595.82] also this isn't in the doc i want to post this just because the video has been going out a lot
[4595.82 → 4602.30] there are fake videos going out um someone i don't know if some of them are maybe real but at
[4602.30 → 4607.26] least one of the videos and the one that i think has probably circulated the most of the Xbox video
[4607.26 → 4613.02] with smoke coming out of the top of it super fake it was called out by quite a few people I'm not the
[4613.02 → 4619.34] first person to call it out but uh it seems like a decent amount of people seem to think that it's legit
[4619.34 → 4624.38] that one in particular not legit uh there might be other ones that are I'm not sure so look out for
[4624.38 → 4631.66] hoaxes basically yes and this happens like every console one fanboys of one side try to make some
[4631.66 → 4635.74] stuff up about the other side the fact of the matter is both sides are having some amount of
[4635.74 → 4641.34] problems which shouldn't be surprising to anyone um the Xbox ones like Linus just mentioned is like
[4641.34 → 4647.34] potentially fan blades clipping it's just making some weird noises in general um it's having issues with
[4647.34 → 4654.62] the optical drive not taking in discs and many boxes were shipped without um like padding or
[4654.62 → 4659.50] bubble wrap just a box inside a bigger box which is not, not awesome especially because some people
[4659.50 → 4666.94] like their console boxes being pristine over time the PS5 has had storage issues uh game reviewer ACG
[4666.94 → 4672.46] reports that PS5 has been bricked as a result of the same storage rebuild issues that other reviewers
[4672.46 → 4678.14] have corroborated he appears to be the first slash only one uh to have the whole console bricked so
[4678.14 → 4685.74] other people are just having some various issues, and it seems to be an uh rebuild database bug
[4686.86 → 4692.38] that's rough I'm sure they will probably fix, but it does suck right now and I'm sure if your console
[4692.38 → 4699.74] gets bricked that way they will replace it um others encounter have encountered uh similar issues when
[4699.74 → 4704.94] putting the system in rest mode during play of spider-man remastered specifically and when
[4704.94 → 4715.26] performing data transfers from the PS4 that sucks uh yeah that's unfortunate but yeah so unsurprisingly
[4715.26 → 4719.82] new thing is having some amount of issues really close to launch that happens its almost like that's
[4719.82 → 4725.98] a thing that happens all the time uh in other news smart access memory is not exclusive to AMD so
[4725.98 → 4731.42] uh confirming what many suspected when AMD made the announcement at the second where gaming begins
[4731.42 → 4738.62] event in October radon 6000 is not the only GPU capable of using smart access memory um basically
[4738.62 → 4744.46] it's a technique where the CPU is given full access to the GPU's memory simultaneously rather than in 256
[4744.46 → 4749.66] Meg chunks which is what you're stuck with without the feature so smart access memory is just AMD's
[4749.66 → 4755.90] marketing term for PCI Express resizable bar a standard that was introduced to the PCI Express
[4755.90 → 4763.26] spec as of gen 4 in 2017 it does not actually require gen 4 though so it could be backported to
[4763.26 → 4769.90] previous generation GPUs we just don't know if it will anyway it's not exclusive to AMD they're just
[4769.90 → 4775.82] the first to capitalize on it so ahead of the radon 6000 launch on November 18th NVIDIA made a statement
[4775.82 → 4781.98] to press that they are working on implementing support for the feature in their PCIE gen 4 based RTX 30 series
[4781.98 → 4788.70] graphics cards bringing them up to speed what we don't know is whether it will actually work
[4789.50 → 4796.62] on AMD's dozen 5000 series platform because my understanding is that the platform itself has to
[4796.62 → 4804.22] support it and i don't know if that support is going to be explicitly for one GPU or another GPU or
[4804.22 → 4809.74] how that is supposed to work so that'll be that'll be pretty fascinating it's hilarious uh this is an
[4809.74 → 4815.34] Anthony young note he writes it's funny that NVIDIA is on the other side of the company claims new
[4815.34 → 4821.50] feature as their own, but really it's just an upcoming industry standard game see also tessellation ray
[4821.50 → 4828.06] tracing variable rate shading mesh shaders basically anything that's defined in direct x12 ultimate
[4828.06 → 4833.18] that's a perfect note that's that's hilarious i love that guy what a great guy isn't he great
[4833.18 → 4842.06] um, and we had a perfect topic um around user benchmark getting blasted on social media i think
[4842.06 → 4846.62] we did actually tease it at the beginning of the show my apologies we are not going to do that we're
[4846.62 → 4850.62] going to reuse it for next week when we're going to have more time to really sink our teeth into that
[4850.62 → 4855.34] one because that's a really, really big topic and Luke and i need to play video games tonight so
[4855.34 → 4861.98] unfortunately we just can't um we can't wait that long um, so there's a couple more housekeeping items
[4861.98 → 4866.22] first i had a couple of people ask who was that guy who called into the show
[4866.22 → 4873.34] so I'm spamming the chat right now with the link to Mr Dave lee's channel he's kind of the man with
[4873.34 → 4879.34] the plan especially when it comes to laptops and mobile devices um let's go ahead and hit float plane
[4879.34 → 4885.90] chat up with those as well oh is that working apparently I'm not allowed to post links out there
[4885.90 → 4890.14] they go there's just a slight delay there you're working on that Luke uh so there you go that's uh
[4890.14 → 4895.50] Mr Dave lee's channel Dave 2d and there was something else that i had wanted to ah yes
[4896.06 → 4903.82] ah yes intel pc tech support challenge number two is coming RGB edition i will be co-hosting with
[4903.82 → 4910.14] Dimitri from hardware Canucks and Christopher Lee will be going up against the toasty bros
[4910.78 → 4917.26] now the toasty bros are two people so they're going to have to tag each other out you know like WWF
[4918.06 → 4923.90] not like world wildlife federation or fund or whatever you know like what WWE used to be you
[4923.90 → 4929.66] know WWF style you know gotta tag in tag out of the tag team match anyway the point is we are sending
[4929.66 → 4936.62] each contestant a quality RGB gaming rig which we messed up before we sent it intel is sponsoring it
[4936.62 → 4942.94] again this time around, and we'll be putting on an absolutely insane giveaway i apparently get to
[4942.94 → 4955.26] tell you now they are giving away 200 200 core i9 10 900k golden sample processors with cry coolers
[4955.26 → 4966.86] what that's pretty no applause that's like that's like 150 grand worth of hardware or
[4966.86 → 4973.74] something like that wait what did I miss something 200 10 900ks with cry coolers i forgot the two i
[4973.74 → 4979.90] didn't hear the 200 there's 200 of them i just heard the 10 900k i thought it was one do not miss
[4979.90 → 4986.46] that stream be there or be square November 24th 10 30 a.m pacific time streaming to float plane YouTube
[4986.46 → 4996.22] and twitch that's actually like even a decent chance yeah compared to like right it was supposed to be an
[4996.22 → 5003.42] Ltd thing rip ah so we're repurposing it we're using it for this stream it's going to be flipping
[5003.42 → 5010.06] what is it what is the term poggers is that the correct slang yeah does that work
[5010.06 → 5016.62] it'll be super loggers all right it's going to be it's going to be loggers all right uh we've got time
[5016.62 → 5022.46] for just a handful of super chats uh Michael Kremer watching while i design a solar preheat domestic hot
[5022.46 → 5027.26] water system for us government consulate in classified i recently applied for one of your
[5027.26 → 5033.58] open positions is 50 us dollars enough for you to respond to me okay so we had a lot of people um
[5033.58 → 5038.62] who do not have Canadian work permits apply for our positions the problem is that if you don't have
[5038.62 → 5046.22] a Canadian work permit yeah can't work in Canada and unfortunately importing you is not as easy as you
[5046.22 → 5052.38] might think if you manage to get a work permit we'd be happy to consider you for the position but if
[5052.38 → 5056.38] you didn't manage to get a work permit we basically immediately threw your application in the garbage
[5057.58 → 5064.78] I'm sorry that's just the way it is ilia asks Sarah's first pc build when i actually sent out an
[5064.78 → 5071.98] email about that today i asked her if she wants to do her own pc build as a follow-up to secret shopper
[5071.98 → 5078.78] with a kind of cool twist on it so instead of me just like hand holding uh like i did when max
[5078.78 → 5087.74] built her first pc i would actually act as like forum sort of advice, so the expectation would be
[5087.74 → 5094.70] that she actually has to sit and figure out the components on her own and then every time she has
[5094.70 → 5102.62] to post a question to me and wait for a response there's going to be like uh like a 20 minute
[5102.62 → 5108.70] penalty or something like that you know because it does take time to do research in that form funny
[5108.70 → 5115.66] if you made the responses as like 19-year-old Linus yeah well 19-year-old Linus was actually
[5115.66 → 5119.98] very thorough and very helpful on computer forums so i would have to dial it back a little bit oh i
[5119.98 → 5125.42] thought you would have been a little aggressive i was no, no i was actually like uh i was definitely
[5125.42 → 5131.18] a member but i like cared and still care i cared a lot about people like getting the best computer for
[5131.18 → 5136.70] their money i got real mad when people were like fanboys and stupid um, so there were definitely
[5136.70 → 5141.10] people i fought with more specifically just about that then yeah so and that still makes me mad because
[5141.10 → 5147.18] it's still stupid um yeah it don't it don't change, but basically the idea is we're not going to go back
[5147.18 → 5156.38] to the m1 conversation okay we're not we're fine so we're going back to wait it is not did Elon change
[5157.18 → 5164.06] the Canadian pricing to be 69 420 we tweeted at him about that uh you know it doesn't matter it
[5164.06 → 5168.46] doesn't matter me oh maybe the s is, but we had tweeted about the y it doesn't matter the point is
[5168.46 → 5175.66] um the way it'll work is when she's done we'll look at how long it took her to kind of like research it
[5175.66 → 5180.30] on her own as someone who's never done it before and then get her to make the final call if you haven't
[5180.30 → 5185.90] built a pc before should you just buy a pre-built, and she can pick having sat through the experience
[5185.90 → 5192.46] with all of these is's she can pick which one she would have chosen and uh she can also compare her
[5192.46 → 5197.66] pre-built or her uh her self-built one so i think it should be i think i know who's going to win because
[5197.66 → 5202.70] honestly if you don't already know how to build a computer it's like kind of waste of time to learn
[5202.70 → 5208.62] how for the purposes of just like building your own rig because it doesn't actually cost that much to have
[5208.62 → 5212.70] someone else do it for you if you pick a good is but I'm going to be interested to see what she
[5212.70 → 5218.54] thinks maybe she'll have enough fun during the process that she'll be into it uh Brandon says
[5218.54 → 5223.50] shout out to nick light and the support team at Ltd store they went above anything i expected i really
[5223.50 → 5228.06] appreciate it they might think it's a small gesture but i appreciate it more than they know hey thanks
[5228.06 → 5234.06] Brandon um Matthew says Linus is right i have no idea what you're talking about so hopefully i was
[5234.06 → 5238.54] actually right and I'm not going to be making an apology video uh originator intentionally
[5238.54 → 5242.46] or not i generally start wan show about five minutes after it goes live and then skip through
[5242.46 → 5247.90] the ad so i figured this would be some fair compensation hey thanks, thanks for the super chat
[5248.86 → 5254.22] um i still don't know why people send super chats there's been a lot of talk about this in the
[5254.22 → 5260.78] twitch community in particular lately with some prominent streamers just like turning off uh bits
[5260.78 → 5267.42] and uh donations and super chats and all kinds of stuff and the funny thing is you guys already know
[5267.42 → 5272.06] that i don't respond to the vast majority of them i just try to do like a few at the end of the show
[5272.06 → 5276.14] maybe we need a better system for this i don't know do you guys want me to just turn them off
[5277.42 → 5281.42] like i don't know what the i don't know what the right answer here is because i can't monitor the chat
[5281.42 → 5288.46] as a whole it moves way too fast this would never work but what would be really cool is if i could
[5288.46 → 5295.02] get a feed of them on my side and like press approve or denying if i pressed approve they would like
[5295.02 → 5299.90] kind of slide up at the bottom of the screen so you could have like live promoted comments but
[5299.90 → 5305.58] that would take a lot of work yeahs i don't I don't know what the best way to handle it is
[5306.38 → 5310.14] because you can't have all of them show up because people could put stuff in there that would be
[5310.14 → 5316.30] extremely not okay to be on screen most people seem to want them turned off so all right now yeah I'll
[5316.30 → 5322.46] consider it I'll consider it you should have a super chat war to see if they should be turned off or not
[5322.46 → 5330.30] float plane unsurprisingly wants me to only respond to float plane yeah come on guys it's the only time
[5330.30 → 5338.38] i look at YouTube stuff uh all right uh kosher says why e GPU is not supported m1 is a SOC integrating
[5338.38 → 5342.62] most of the components of the computer yeah, but that doesn't mean it can't have enough PCI Express lanes
[5342.62 → 5351.18] to run an e GPU and if it has thunderbolt i guess, so the truth is i don't know that much about what
[5351.18 → 5356.22] differentiates usb4 from thunderbolt and intel themselves have been kind of vague about it
[5357.02 → 5363.18] so i guess we'll have to see i don't necessarily think that your theory is correct uh we're gonna
[5363.18 → 5369.26] have to wait for the truth to come out on that one Ryan Duffy asks could a good networking card
[5369.26 → 5373.98] improve ping stability versus motherboard onboard very unlikely
[5373.98 → 5381.02] uh but robotic says hey Linus I've seen all leg videos since whole room water cooling it's a long
[5381.02 → 5384.54] time ago i just wanted to say hi and let you know i love what you do thank you very much
[5387.10 → 5389.02] um okay
[5391.50 → 5396.46] Juan says giving a computer science point of view Linus isn't technically wrong the truth is the arm
[5396.46 → 5401.10] architecture just isn't there I'll always simp for Linus love or hate him these are iPads that went to the
[5401.10 → 5409.98] gym well okay it's not that simple the thing that we haven't seen before is and that is unique about
[5409.98 → 5417.58] this situation is that apple with the iPhone and iPad has got over 10 years of experience under their
[5417.58 → 5423.82] belts building these chips and their developer community has over 10 years of experience building
[5423.82 → 5432.14] high performance and well optimized apps for them so no this will be a success i mean there's no way
[5432.14 → 5436.22] apple goes back so it's either going to be a success or they will call it a success one way or the other
[5436.70 → 5443.74] um, but it's not going to be a disaster eventually grid says i purchased a keyboard t-shirt in the wrong
[5443.74 → 5449.82] colour Ltd support sent me the correct one um but i decided to keep both so here's the money for the second
[5449.82 → 5457.74] order oh, thank you uh all right i decided to keep both Robert mail says disable super chats do it you
[5457.74 → 5464.62] won't he sends a super chat like almost every uh almost every Wang show uh well i think they were
[5464.62 → 5472.54] giving him the option to um send it back or pay more maybe I'm actually not sure if i don't I don't know
[5472.54 → 5478.78] but he basically sent a super chat for the amount of the keyboard, so thanks google yeah
[5480.62 → 5485.42] all right that's pretty much it for the show today thank you guys for tuning in i actually had a
[5485.42 → 5489.26] great time today it was really fun having Dave on the show we should really go back to bring
[5489.26 → 5496.46] on guests more often we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[5498.22 → 5502.46] man i was hoping someone would call in because i honestly couldn't find anything
[5504.14 → 5507.74] like i found like a couple tweets and there was a video i didn't really want to sit and watch the whole
[5507.74 → 5512.70] video live but like usually on something like that like you read the comments on that video
[5513.50 → 5518.78] and you can find stuff, but the comments were just like 80 plus percent of it which means
[5519.34 → 5522.54] yeah no one really seems to care so like the dislike on the videos
[5523.66 → 5529.26] that's fine guys below average, but it's fine yeah but that i think that's going to happen literally
[5529.26 → 5534.38] anytime you do anything with apple whether it's positive or negative or accurate or inaccurate like
[5534.38 → 5537.90] it's always going to be a little bit lower than it's polarizing exactly
