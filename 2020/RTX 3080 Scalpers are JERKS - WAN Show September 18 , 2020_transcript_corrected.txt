[0.00 → 11.90] oh okay hey what's up guys welcome to when show we've got a spectacular show for you all today
[11.90 → 19.20] there is so much news to talk about there was an Apple event this week there was the launch of the
[19.20 → 26.50] RTX 3080 sorts of because sort of good luck buying one there was uh what else we got here Luke what
[26.50 → 30.90] you want to talk about price was announced oh we're definitely going to be talking about that
[30.90 → 35.62] okay, okay hold on hold on I swear I'm going to let us run the intro in a second here
[35.62 → 45.34] just give me a score out of 10 for the PS5 pricing score out of 10 uh one out of 10 okay I like it i
[45.34 → 48.88] like it, we'll get into more depth into that later ladies and gentlemen what else we got
[48.88 → 57.34] uh did I give two uh no, no no come on go for it go for the one WeChat officially really in the U.S.
[57.34 → 62.36] that's a headline compared to you already talked about you already talked about this no I didn't
[62.36 → 67.96] you said NVIDIA stuff no but not that are we giving NVIDIA two headlining well they've got two
[67.96 → 75.74] headlines they killed slit hey got the good headline I mean that like it was already dead you know what
[75.74 → 80.96] Luke I've had I've had enough of your I'm not gonna I'm not going to bleep myself swearing because I got
[80.96 → 87.18] part of the monetization disabled on a last wan show because I had too much bleep swearing in the
[87.18 → 92.18] first 30 seconds of the video so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to roll the intro then I'm gonna talk about
[92.18 → 93.52] how I feel about that
[93.52 → 100.18] all right all right
[100.18 → 118.76] wait hold on a second rip Ruth Bader Ginsburg no way am i this far am I this far out of
[118.76 → 127.18] the loop MSI conquer the battlefield back blaze conquer the back-up your storage that's right I said
[127.18 → 133.38] coupon what are you going to do about it, you and i uh are apparently that far out of the loop
[133.38 → 143.70] really yep no way when uh it's it looked like hours ago nope minutes ago
[143.70 → 156.40] CNN posted 35 minutes ago New York times eight minutes ago wow okay uh sorry guys i uh
[156.40 → 167.68] I'm sorry I'm just I'm just finding this out now crazy all right then uh in other news uh technology
[167.68 → 175.60] um wow okay you were going to yell at me for SLI stuff yes I was you know what let's jump
[175.60 → 179.16] right into that one I don't even remember what the title of the stream is today
[179.16 → 186.98] NVIDIA RTX 3080 scalpers are jerks should we do that first no do the headline no we are talking
[186.98 → 195.12] about NVIDIA SLI I'm getting my display capture going here i have to read oh, oh I just moved i just
[195.12 → 201.38] moved the Luke source if you see is this okay there we go NVIDIA SLI are you going to hover your mouse over it
[201.38 → 209.86] again transitioning support is transitioning that's another way of saying being dead and buried
[209.86 → 215.22] to native game integrations you're not even gonna you're pulling a Linus here you're not even letting
[215.22 → 223.24] me talk fine because you go then you go title of NVIDIA quietly kills slit his is like if is NVIDIA is
[223.24 → 229.58] getting the credit for killing SLI it's a kill steal it's a kill steal so who are you giving the credit
[229.58 → 241.00] for killing SLI Microsoft um well direct x12 doesn't exactly like yours you think reviewers killed
[241.00 → 249.08] SLI kind of like very justifiably like they earned it, and it was good and people should be happy
[249.08 → 254.86] people should be happy pushing SLI for a long time when it was a giant steaming pile of garbage
[254.86 → 260.06] okay it was terrible okay it sucked, and they were still pushing it because they were like yeah
[260.06 → 264.98] buy four graphics cards and reviewers were like this is dumb this is stupid don't do it
[264.98 → 271.52] um we started releasing the I don't even remember what it was called uh compensator
[271.52 → 276.90] compensator yeah we started releasing that to just like basically make fun of slit hat was almost the
[276.90 → 284.36] entire point of those videos that's true we released other we also made fun of extreme editions
[284.36 → 290.08] and overpriced motherboards and power supplies yeah, but those weren't the reasons why the system like
[290.08 → 296.26] literally performed worse than other systems that was the fun true well sometimes they sometimes did
[296.26 → 303.38] the big multicore extreme editions did actually perform worse than the yeah than the lower
[303.38 → 310.96] threaded consumer chips yeah yeah that's true, but it was and absolutely, but it was mostly trashing on SLI
[310.96 → 316.52] um yes and this has been like a theme this was a theme for us this was a theme for other reviewers
[316.52 → 323.16] for a very long time while NVIDIA was still pushing it then like basically the whole industry just stopped
[323.16 → 328.94] I don't think very many people were pushing SLI at all I saw a lot less of it in enthusiast builds
[328.94 → 336.96] it basically didn't exist anymore, and now they're they're pulling support for if it's already dead
[336.96 → 343.68] it's its it's that maybe they're pulling the plug, but it's been on like life support with no
[343.68 → 351.66] visitors for a long time okay so here 's's why I'm bummed, and you'll have to forgive me for maybe
[351.66 → 360.18] making some assumptions here but I'm bummed because it feels like NVIDIA is pulling SLI support
[360.18 → 371.78] at the point in its history where it is more likely than ever to work well okay over the last
[371.78 → 379.10] couple of generations over the last few generations actually NVIDIA has taken the SLI interface
[379.10 → 389.72] are you done now are you done laughing at me all right no I'm not laughing i actually it's a funny
[389.72 → 395.62] comment because it's true so NVIDIA has taken the SLI interface which used to be let's see high
[395.62 → 403.76] bandwidth was 650 megahertz uh the older one ran at a slower 400 megahertz how much actual bandwidth was
[403.76 → 411.72] this standard bridge support SLI maximum theoretical here we go so at 400 megahertz it could do uh two
[411.72 → 419.70] gigabytes per second in dual channel that's that's not very fast by contrast the latest uh iteration
[419.70 → 428.24] of link so if we were to actually say okay look what we really need for SLI to work better is a
[428.24 → 433.92] much higher bandwidth interface between the GPUs so they can share uh you know frame buffer information
[433.92 → 443.30] or whatever the case may be well we were already there dang it link 3.0 is 50 gigabits per
[443.30 → 449.44] second it's like over the last few generations they've taken that two gigabyte per second they've gone to
[449.44 → 457.62] two and a half three point something and six point something like come on they're they've actually
[457.62 → 463.00] got it to the point where like squadron can share memory they can actually pool memory and
[463.00 → 468.34] work on like compute workloads together on a workstation I know it's not the same thing Luke I'm
[468.34 → 474.32] just saying it seems like if they'd actually been dedicated to it instead of building you know the
[474.32 → 480.46] world's premier AI computing company that I think they could have solved it that's all I'm saying
[480.46 → 488.64] that's it yeah i I agree a lot of the productivity style things don't need to like SLI to use both graphics
[488.64 → 494.72] cards um no but link allows them to share their memory it allows them to pool their memory so you can
[494.72 → 501.94] work on much, much larger workloads so where's that from my games I just want that from my games
[501.94 → 511.04] I want to I want to play 12k uh flight simulator dot um so from the blog post should we at least run
[511.04 → 515.84] through what this means because if you have a SLI system that this doesn't necessarily mean that
[515.84 → 522.52] immediately you're going to lose any performance benefit you would have gotten so okay well look
[522.52 → 528.56] some games had a performance benefit man you're such a jerk for someone who has SLI graphics cards
[528.56 → 534.70] you sure are hating on people with SLI graphics cards an awful, awful hard here I didn't even ask
[534.70 → 540.02] for them and technically right now I don't because you told Emma she could have one of mine and
[540.02 → 547.92] now it's in her system did I really oh I did do that didn't I yeah I'm awesome I'm hilarious okay
[547.92 → 553.68] all right so back to back to the blog post with the emergence of low-level graphics APIs such as
[553.68 → 558.58] direct x12 and Vulcan game developers are able to implement SLI support natively within the game
[558.58 → 562.36] itself instead of relying upon a slid river profile which is just another way of saying
[562.36 → 569.72] that it's a percent of a what it's a one percent of one percent of users and game developers would
[569.72 → 576.44] basically be idiots to spend actual dev cycles on implementing this unless the intent of their game
[576.44 → 581.46] is for it to be used as a benchmark you know if you're some if you're working on something like a
[581.46 → 587.96] crisis remastered or whatever so hence NVIDIA will no longer be adding new slid river profiles on RTX 20
[587.96 → 593.90] series and earlier GPUs starting on January 1st 2021 instead we will focus efforts on supporting
[593.90 → 600.84] developers to implement SLI natively inside the game so that's clearly not happening at all
[600.84 → 609.64] yeah then there's an uh oh man so for GeForce RTX 3090 remember RTX 3090 is still SLI ready they just
[609.64 → 616.36] shipped like right days before this blog post went up the first reviewers would have been hands
[616.36 → 625.72] on with RTX 3090 they just shipped a SLI capable GPU um, and they're saying so for that SLI will only
[625.72 → 631.18] be supported when implemented natively within the game so that's fine because there's a big long list
[631.18 → 638.38] of game titles that you can enjoy here in the blog post such hits as zombie army 4 dead war
[638.38 → 647.50] strange brigade okay most of these are somewhat recognizable so we got shadow the Tomb Raider
[647.50 → 654.16] civ 6 sniper elite 4th civ 6 like okay sure gears in war 4 ashes of singularity escalation lots of
[654.16 → 659.32] people played that game it was big esports title uh rise of the Tomb Raider hitman day sex mankind
[659.32 → 664.48] divided halo wars 2 battlefields 1 and then Vulcan games that support it are Red Dead Redemption 2
[664.48 → 671.14] okay that's like i I would say that that qualifies as like a triple a title legit then we've got
[671.14 → 676.62] quake 2 RTX ashes of singularity strange brigade zombie army 4 dead war so we have Red Dead Redemption
[676.62 → 683.74] 2 benchmark other more different benchmark yeah yeah and Deus ex yeah
[683.74 → 696.06] oh well okay I have been preaching for a long time that you are far better off just you know getting
[696.06 → 703.90] one better GPU than two slower ones and ever since you know video's been trying to price it that way
[703.90 → 711.34] anyway so yep ever since like NVIDIA and uh gaming media and consumers in general woke up to the
[711.34 → 717.94] importance of frame times compared to frame rates yeah, and we figured out how to actually quantify the
[717.94 → 725.52] micro stuttering that mostly people just felt beforehand um there's been a big shift away from
[725.52 → 732.94] dual or especially triple or quadruple GPU solutions because that that added latency like micro
[732.94 → 737.64] stutter latency uh really hurt the gaming experience even if your system was actually
[737.64 → 743.56] you know feeding a lot of frames they weren't being delivered smoothly, and it wasn't really a
[743.56 → 753.04] fantastic experience I will miss it as just like a fun you know EP narrator way to you know trick out
[753.04 → 760.78] your system I guess but i I can also see how now that NVIDIA is committed to this strategy it seems
[760.78 → 770.78] of building more and more massive GPUs generation by generation um it almost feels unnecessary like
[770.78 → 779.08] now that NVIDIA has launched the RTX 3090 which has uh hold on a second RTX 3090 power consumption let me just
[779.08 → 788.72] see if anyone has sort of quoted that already um this the card is expected to utilize around 350 watts of
[788.72 → 794.56] power I mean not only did they just launch a 350 watt GPU they designed a new connector for it that's
[794.56 → 799.60] good for up to I think what 600 watts so if that's their commitment going forward is like we're going
[799.60 → 806.70] to completely reimagine you know thermal controls for desktop gaming computers so we can
[806.70 → 813.50] start shipping like bigger more monstrous power hungry GPUs from now on into the future I mean if NVIDIA
[813.50 → 821.34] just offers you a single card that's like yeah what you know SLI would have been but we just
[821.34 → 828.96] baked it into a chip this big you can't really complain about that right and the whole yeah the
[828.96 → 838.32] whole many smaller GPUs strategy has already been tried, and it was a failure um AMD went that routeway
[838.32 → 847.30] back in the 3000 series days and I mean the old 3000 did they do a new 3000 hold on 480 trying to
[847.30 → 855.74] remember yeah 3000 so the Radeon HD like 3870 was not competitive with NVIDIA's top end it was more
[855.74 → 861.38] competitive with NVIDIA's step down and then the way AMD positioned it was oh well we'll just pack two of
[861.38 → 866.58] these onto a card to get competitive at the top end it didn't work it didn't work then it doesn't work
[866.58 → 873.72] now and until someone builds like a chaplet GPU I don't think we're going to see any kind of
[873.72 → 882.78] multi-die uh you know gaming graphics solution um i I will be very interested to see what if anything
[882.78 → 887.20] intel can pull out of their sleeves though because we've actually been hands-on with z graphics now
[887.20 → 893.30] I don't think our video is actually up yet but I'm fairly certain the embargo is lifted so I guess I can
[893.30 → 905.26] talk about it, and so we tested a laptop with on board intel z graphics and wow it's its pretty
[905.26 → 911.68] impressive um let me just make sure the embargo is up on this yeah yesterday the embargo
[911.68 → 918.76] lifted so we had an intel 11th gen mobile chip absolutely thrashing an AMD chip with radon graphics
[918.76 → 927.98] in it now that wasn't featuring um rDNA 2 obviously so AMD definitely has they have a generation
[927.98 → 935.06] literally in the chamber to pull out and combat this with, but we don't know how good rDNA 2 is
[935.06 → 941.32] so, and we don't know how well it'll scale down to something like a mobile CPU so for now intel has
[941.32 → 948.56] managed to take back the crown in at least in at least one way one way definitely at least one
[948.56 → 960.18] way, and you know what I say to that good for you hooray, hooray indeed so scalpers ah fine I wanted to
[960.18 → 965.76] talk about SLI some more I'm going to miss if it was so cool no, no I'm done I'm over it I'm over it just
[965.76 → 974.04] like NVIDIA is just like thanks for that uh consumers troll RTX 3080 scalpers so
[974.04 → 978.94] let's talk about the situation here I mean Luke and I saw this coming Luke did we talk about this
[978.94 → 984.66] on wan show last week we did we did yep you know i actually I had a tweet from someone who was
[984.66 → 990.30] real mad at me, they're real mad because um I think someone I think hardware connects posted
[990.30 → 998.14] on Twitter that they are withholding any RTX 3080 content that they otherwise had planned to release
[998.14 → 1005.06] um out of oh man what did they say it was something to do with because people can't actually buy it
[1005.06 → 1012.28] they don't want to they don't want to make uh content that's like promoting it or something like
[1012.28 → 1018.44] that I'm going to modify the schedule a bit posting build slash more RTX 3080 content right now just doesn't
[1018.44 → 1023.38] feel right promoting an item that's being scalped so heavily would just feed the situation even more
[1023.38 → 1028.00] it's our true hope that NVIDIA GeForce put solutions in place for the next launches
[1028.00 → 1037.30] um so I get it yeah I get it um but also like the only reason this doesn't happen every generation is
[1037.30 → 1044.02] because some generations just aren't exciting every time a graphics card has launched that people
[1044.02 → 1050.62] actually want getting them has been like finding a hen's tooth in a haystack if you know what I mean
[1050.62 → 1057.38] like I worked on the procurement side for multiple generations of graphics card launches and the only
[1057.38 → 1063.52] ones that we could get adequate supply are were extraordinarily unexciting ones like GTS 250 you know
[1063.52 → 1068.90] whether it was VGA or total or gigabyte they'd be on the phone and be like hey you want a want a
[1068.90 → 1075.22] big launch allocation of GTS 250 and be like no what I want that for there's going to be plenty
[1075.22 → 1079.02] of them I'll just order them later when you guys have got them on rebate, and we'll deal with that
[1079.02 → 1084.84] down the line when it came to flagship launches like I remember times when you know someone like
[1084.84 → 1092.06] an VGA would ship us 11 units you know like they couldn't even do a nice round number, and you know
[1092.06 → 1097.44] they would try to follow it up right like they'd get you another six you know later on that week
[1097.44 → 1103.18] but the only way to get one was to backorder it and then just hope that you picked the right skew
[1103.18 → 1109.90] because the way that NCI worked with them uh you couldn't be like oh hey I'm at this point in the
[1109.90 → 1117.80] queue on like VGA KO or whatever and then like chose shipment comes in you, you wouldn't like to get an
[1117.80 → 1122.78] option to get one of those you would just be sitting there hooped because the know the exact one
[1122.78 → 1129.08] of NVIDIA's or VGA's two dozen skews for the same stupid GPU wouldn't come in and you just you're
[1129.08 → 1135.90] just totally hosed um but I remember this happening all the time and that that's one of the big like
[1135.90 → 1141.90] advantages that you would try to make for yourself as a retailer is you try to get in the good graces
[1141.90 → 1149.00] of the add-in board partners and NVIDIA themselves to make sure that you've got allocation because when
[1149.00 → 1154.96] you've got a hot new GPU it does more than just get you the know five percent profit if you're
[1154.96 → 1160.28] lucky on that graphics card yes my friends it is pretty normal for a retailer to make between five
[1160.28 → 1165.54] to eight percent even on a thousand plus dollar graphics card, but it's about more than that because
[1165.54 → 1171.56] someone buying that graphics card well you're by having it when nobody else has it you're creating a
[1171.56 → 1176.20] customer experience you're giving yourself an opportunity to build a relationship with that customer so
[1176.20 → 1181.40] maybe they'll come back and also there's the like system builder factor a lot of people don't upgrade
[1181.40 → 1185.92] their old system they just build a whole new system so when they see that new graphics card launch they
[1185.92 → 1190.56] go oh hey time to upgrade so by having the graphics card in stock you're not making a thousand dollar
[1190.56 → 1195.36] sale you're making a three thousand dollar sale as they build a whole new top of the line system
[1195.36 → 1202.68] so we would work really hard to try and get allocation of these cards meanwhile board partners are working
[1202.68 → 1207.70] real hard with NVIDIA to try and get allocation of the GPUs and I assure you that NVIDIA is working
[1207.70 → 1212.92] real hard trying to produce as many of these GPUs as they can, you think NVIDIA wants to ship fewer
[1212.92 → 1219.44] graphics cards than they absolutely have to uh no has NVIDIA ever given you any indication that they
[1219.44 → 1229.42] don't like making money no definitely no it just is what it is unless your apple, and you literally run
[1229.42 → 1238.62] like multiple factories around the clock for two months leading up to a launch it is normal for a
[1238.62 → 1245.14] really hot item to be in short supply that's just the way it is so anyway I had someone real mad at me
[1245.14 → 1252.26] about the can it run crisis uh 3080 video that went up the day after the review in light of hardware
[1252.26 → 1260.78] Canucks is much more moral stance on the situation and my take is like what you can't watch that video
[1260.78 → 1270.08] in two weeks or four weeks or six weeks from now and like to enjoy it then when you can buy a graphics card
[1270.08 → 1276.42] or like i I don't know i just don't get it what difference does it make and like if you can't
[1276.42 → 1282.86] if you can't be disciplined enough to not spend you know fit a 1500 on a graphics card like twice
[1282.86 → 1288.62] what it's worth one bay that's that's on you that's not on me like i I don't know what to tell you
[1288.62 → 1298.06] like I don't have a personal 3080 yet so it's okay we can wait a little bit i think something
[1298.06 → 1305.38] that i I saw which I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it but I saw some memes about it
[1305.38 → 1313.26] was gamers gamer gamers' nexus's stance on this stuff which is just like I think they said
[1313.26 → 1319.86] something along the lines of like it's not it's not food and water like you'll be fine yeah the
[1319.86 → 1325.58] irony is that as far as I can tell Steve from gamers nexus plays fewer games than I do
[1325.58 → 1333.98] no I will okay if you're looking just at like the name of the channel sure but like the uh I think the
[1333.98 → 1338.52] the sentiment there is good like what you have right now is probably fine if it was fine a week
[1338.52 → 1345.80] ago yes it's its fine now yes just relax it'll, it'll come back in stock at some point you'll be
[1345.80 → 1350.66] able to get your card at some point, and you'll be fine these are optional items these are optional
[1350.66 → 1357.94] not like the PlayStation 5 which as we all know is just as essential as shelter clean water you know
[1357.94 → 1365.08] access to medical care um let's just talk through what's going on with the 3080 for
[1365.08 → 1371.16] those who are not familiar so uh pretty much any listing that shows the card in stock is being
[1371.16 → 1378.18] instantaneously sold out and while bot protection is in place for most if not all the online stores
[1378.18 → 1383.86] several scalpers have been shown to have bought dozens of cards within seconds of orders going live
[1383.86 → 1390.14] so that appears to be a big part of the problem so one of the most common bots seems to have been
[1390.14 → 1395.24] provided by bounce alerts who confirmed with pc magazine that they did indeed provide a bot to
[1395.24 → 1400.94] help members purchase the RTX 3080 units on launch day so they said the bot works as an automated script
[1400.94 → 1405.22] to run basically from the product page to payment information and checkout monitoring when the product
[1405.22 → 1410.98] gets back in stock and immediately checking out NVIDIA's website actually crashed during the early
[1410.98 → 1414.84] phase of the sale meaning the bots had to be restarted manually allowing at least some legitimate
[1414.84 → 1420.86] buyers to get their orders in now NVIDIA claims that they're doing everything humanly possible to
[1420.86 → 1428.46] review RTX 3080 orders to verify that they're human but like realistically there's only so much that i
[1428.46 → 1436.72] think they can do I mean all it takes is a slightly more sophisticated bot to uh you know try to act a
[1436.72 → 1440.04] little bit more human you know put a different name on it here and there that sort of thing
[1440.04 → 1445.62] um so many shoppers have been left out in the cold while eBay auctions have sprung up at astronomical
[1445.62 → 1453.62] prices now the community seems to not be taking this in stride because these graphics cards are in
[1453.62 → 1461.44] fact essential to their way of life and um someone has created a bot that has been automatically scraping
[1461.44 → 1470.02] eBay for RTX 3080 listings and placing ridiculous bids on the cards with no intention of paying them
[1470.04 → 1480.20] so that um basically the auction will run out, and that scalper is just going to be stuck with a card
[1480.20 → 1485.96] and a buyer that has no intent to pay now to be clear we're not condoning any of this behaviour I'm not
[1485.96 → 1492.12] condoning scalpers and I'm not condoning fraud because that's what it is um, but we're just going to
[1492.12 → 1497.06] talk about it on when show and we've actually had some bad experience with this I don't know you probably
[1497.06 → 1505.70] remember that stupid video with the blue iPhone thing i do actually, and we got screwed
[1505.70 → 1510.92] on that, and we were just trying to help we were literally trying to donate money yeah to testicular
[1510.92 → 1519.86] cancer research yep, and we got screwed over the the did this to our eBay listing of that phone
[1519.86 → 1525.32] not just one because we made our way down the list and basically every one of the bidders had no intention
[1525.32 → 1535.04] of paying, and it's just like okay yeah uh so I guess I don't remember how that got resolved I think we flipped
[1535.04 → 1539.96] it on Craigslist and donated the money just quietly and decided not to do anything like that for a long
[1539.96 → 1546.68] time um yeah was pretty much it is like way to go you ruined it for everyone uh yeah, yeah so it's its been
[1546.68 → 1552.22] used in whatever you want however you want to think about this the way it's being used for 3080 it's been
[1552.22 → 1559.10] used in very not good ways as well yep um, so other users are taking a different approach making
[1559.10 → 1564.56] misleading listings for RTX 3080 cards removing them from sale before the auction actually ends
[1564.56 → 1571.70] so there's a 3080 printed slash paper edition whatever that is um
[1571.70 → 1581.50] there's one posted by Gabon's son which is just like a drawing of it i actually i kind of am not a hundred
[1581.50 → 1587.68] percent sure how this is relevant but hey there it is uh for a hundred thousand dollars so I guess
[1587.68 → 1594.36] they're just trying to create so much disorder in the market that it's making it really difficult to
[1594.36 → 1603.42] actually flip them um some folks have taken to review bombing the RTX 3080 one bay to um make other
[1603.42 → 1614.30] people think that it's a scam um yeah so it's pretty it's pretty interesting um it's uncertain
[1614.30 → 1619.48] whether NVIDIA expected this to happen but they claim that demand has been unprecedented and that
[1619.48 → 1626.90] may actually be the case because uh looking at uh hard further on into hardware Canucks's uh tweet storm
[1626.90 → 1632.98] here not really storm let's call it a thread um they said that hold on where is it blah blah blah blah
[1632.98 → 1637.36] blah blah I don't know they had another tweet I saw it somewhere maybe it was a reply to someone
[1637.36 → 1641.68] but basically they called around some retailers and they said that allocation was actually better
[1641.68 → 1649.00] than some previous launches it's just a really, really hot card I am not surprised at all like
[1649.00 → 1654.74] that's the thing that's the thing that's hilarious to me, I've seen this so many times you know so
[1654.74 → 1661.96] many times and I just don't get it you know whether it's a CPU manufacturer being like yeah you guys
[1661.96 → 1665.88] you guys better make sure you stock up on this thing it's going to be hot it's going to be hot
[1665.88 → 1671.82] and then I get it in my hands and I'm like I could have told you from 20 minutes with this thing
[1671.82 → 1679.00] like a quicks and a bench run and like two gaming benchmarks that it's not hot like what gave you the
[1679.00 → 1685.42] idea that it was hot what is this based on or the other way around your trust when something is
[1685.42 → 1690.34] actually hot exactly, and then you see it the other way around where you've got NVIDIA here that's
[1690.34 → 1697.52] like yeah this is the biggest intergenerational increase that we've made like in a decade or
[1697.52 → 1703.56] whatever however long it's been and even over hyping it themselves like is that it like did they
[1703.56 → 1708.42] did they make the up to two times performance claims during their keynote because of like insecurity
[1708.42 → 1715.80] like they're they're over hyping it they know that it's fast they must know it's fast they have all
[1715.80 → 1721.54] the same benchmarking tools and games that we do better ones even, and then they're like oh we didn't
[1721.54 → 1727.46] we really didn't expect it to sell this well the craziest thing is they didn't have to launch it yet
[1727.46 → 1734.74] the next gen consoles aren't coming until what November when is the actual ship date for PlayStation 5
[1734.74 → 1740.48] manufacturing yeah they could have just November 12th but at the same time as that's not better for
[1740.48 → 1747.36] oh it totally is a big red-hot launch where everyone who wants one can get one is the
[1747.36 → 1756.64] best that's huge there's more people talking about it this way uh yes and no because remember when
[1756.64 → 1761.86] you're actually shipping product people are going to be posting on Twitter hey here's my new card
[1761.86 → 1768.50] here's my benchmark scores so you get conversation either way no strong disagree strongly disagree I think
[1768.50 → 1774.12] real product in the hands of real users because remember like for all for every person who trusts
[1774.12 → 1781.10] me let's say to say RTX 3080 great card go buy it there's going to be 50 users that aren't going to do
[1781.10 → 1786.62] it until they hear it from their buddy and in a lot of cases their buddy might just watch my video and be
[1786.62 → 1792.22] like yeah I wasn't due for an upgrade but like Linus says it's good go for it that can happen a lot
[1792.22 → 1799.18] but a lot of the time if you're that buddy you know everyone's buddy who's into tech you are buying
[1799.18 → 1803.16] it you're buying it, and you're going to use it you're going to be like yeah you all yeah I'm on this
[1803.16 → 1808.42] thing's dope it's dope, and then they're going to run out and buy it so getting it in the hands of those
[1808.42 → 1813.74] of those micro influencers is what I'd call them the people that are so passionate about these
[1813.74 → 1819.88] graphics cards they like your friend groups tech guy exactly, exactly getting it in the in every one of
[1819.88 → 1825.82] those people's hands that should be your number one priority which is exactly why lttstore.com
[1825.82 → 1833.56] is doing a nice big run of this is the most exciting hold on this is sweet okay this is the most
[1833.56 → 1841.24] exciting t-shirt launch that we have had oh man I don't know in quite some time so it's limited edition
[1841.24 → 1848.56] it uses this sweet foil that actually took a fair bit of work for our printer whose local
[1848.56 → 1857.18] um fair bit of work to get the hang of, but this is I forget what it's called this is the keyboard
[1857.18 → 1867.70] shirt special edition my friends' oh yeah so it's got like this sweet iridescent foil, and so we're
[1867.70 → 1875.76] calling it uh the like rgb keyboard because you got that uh that RGB effect on it uh it is
[1875.76 → 1882.82] more expensive than our usual shirts because the the foil is more expensive than what we typically
[1882.82 → 1890.46] print with and b there are imperfect yields so we'll get bubbles, or we'll get little gaps in the
[1890.46 → 1895.62] transfer um it's a combination of it just being trickier to work with and us not having as much
[1895.62 → 1902.44] experience with it um but some of our shirts are they don't make the cut now just so you guys know
[1902.44 → 1908.62] don't worry none of those shirts are going to end up in a landfill uh they will all be donated or if
[1908.62 → 1915.36] what is going on here they'll all be donated or if we end up with so much of it that it's not really
[1915.36 → 1922.14] feasible to donate it to a single place um then what we might do is like a misprint skew or something
[1922.14 → 1926.90] like that like hey do you not care if it's perfect well here you go it's definitely cheaper
[1926.90 → 1932.56] so we'll figure it out we're not going to waste if I can interject yeah yeah yeah go for it and it
[1932.56 → 1938.10] might it might be a long time to hold the inventory and that's its whole own thing, so maybe this is
[1938.10 → 1945.58] terrible but I'm assuming we're doing, or you're doing uh Ltd 2021 you could do like we don't know
[1945.58 → 1952.02] we don't know yet yeah it's not really looking like it's going to get better I mean you're not
[1952.02 → 1956.02] even allowed to have big gatherings in Canada so that was that's kind of a downer thing for you to
[1956.02 → 1966.54] bring up yeah okay well eventually yeah we'd love to do a signature thing you see Mr b signed like
[1966.54 → 1973.24] 150 000 shirts or something like that yeah I know right of course I even meant like just, just like
[1973.24 → 1979.60] selling them or I don't know giving them away or something at Ltd to get signatures from people that
[1979.60 → 1984.14] are at the event right you're right yeah yeah yeah just using them as a swag item sure because it's like
[1984.14 → 1990.46] uh there's some kind of novelty yeah to a failed print I'm not gonna hold on to them for 18 months
[1990.46 → 1998.72] though unfortunately oh that's where I'm at that definitely makes sense holding them until
[1998.72 → 2008.66] 20 freaking 22 makes no sense yeah yeah so anyway uh back to ltxtstore.com yeah uh
[2008.66 → 2013.48] uh um there we go let's go ahead and click on this thing look at this guy look at this
[2013.48 → 2018.98] shirt is that sweet or what now there are a couple of important things to note guys if you are ordering
[2018.98 → 2027.82] this shirt wash the shirt inside out with the art facing in cold water only and always hang to dry
[2027.82 → 2034.64] never tumble heat dry there is nothing we're going to be able to do for you warranty wise if you
[2034.64 → 2040.62] destroy the shirt by putting it in the dryer it will fade slash be destroyed extremely quickly
[2040.62 → 2047.56] so if you don't have the discipline to cold wash it then don't buy it there are lots of other shirts
[2047.56 → 2052.96] for you yeah there are lots of other shirts literally everything else on ltxtstore.com is designed to be
[2052.96 → 2058.12] crumpled up into a ball chucked in your hamper thrown in the washing machine at whatever temperature
[2058.12 → 2064.82] tickles your fancy and then thrown in the tumble dryer everything else no problem not this one
[2064.82 → 2071.70] please be more careful with it so uh guys that is going to be a limited edition print I believe we
[2071.70 → 2079.84] are planning to do 300 of them um by the way oh I have an update on the CPU pins shirt so we had
[2079.84 → 2086.56] three that were printed with an alternate design and two of the prizes have been claimed so we are we
[2086.56 → 2092.40] arranging corsair vengeance gaming pcs for those folks, and we are waiting to hear back from one more
[2092.40 → 2100.96] of our winners so that's a totally, totally unrelated um that's a totally unrelated thing
[2100.96 → 2109.02] how we did shirts before with a previous design that were a little bit different, and they got a cool prize
[2109.02 → 2115.80] by the way we're launching the keyboard shirt go check it out
[2115.80 → 2121.66] I can't promise we would ever do anything like that again
[2121.66 → 2124.54] thanks
[2124.54 → 2138.62] all right lets uh move on to uh let's move on to oh you know what we should get through let's yeah let's
[2138.62 → 2142.62] get through our sponsors here, and then we'll talk about PlayStation 5 pricing

[2196.74 → 2204.38] msi hey it's the MSI mag b50 b550 tomahawk motherboard, so the new tomahawk is significantly
[2204.38 → 2210.34] better built than the old tomahawk it is more expensive but the b550 tomahawk is a pretty freaking
[2210.34 → 2218.58] sweet motherboard it's got everything you need as a gamer and I mean really I said this during my b550
[2218.58 → 2224.90] like motherboard unboxing on short circuit but I was like as a gamer is there any reason to buy x570
[2224.90 → 2236.54] I really don't know it supports high speed ddr4 memory uh m.2 uh m.2 uh m.2 holy crap uh we sold
[2236.54 → 2249.56] through half our shirts already uh yeah go with your sister um oh crap hold on I might have to do some
[2249.56 → 2255.70] business things uh oh crap we might have to oh no we might have to actually print more, but we have
[2255.70 → 2261.60] we had a plan to like hand QC all of them and the person who's going to do that I don't know if they're
[2261.60 → 2267.66] going to have time to do more I got to send a quick message to nick uh are we going to have time to QC
[2267.66 → 2276.04] more can we print more uh okay uh hold on a second so MSI the MSI Meg b550 tomahawk
[2276.04 → 2285.54] it's got PCIE gen 4 m.2 and a 16x slot for your new RTX 3000 graphics onboard two and a half gig LAN
[2285.54 → 2291.20] which is really a great compromise between cost and performance uh between gigabit and 10 gig and
[2291.20 → 2297.50] premium thermal solution check it out the link in the video description wow um that's crazy we need
[2297.50 → 2302.08] to I don't know you know what it doesn't matter let's just uh I'll let I'll keep you guys updated
[2302.08 → 2310.50] I'm sure Nick's going to be replying to me um uh okay apple's fall event hey did you see anything
[2310.50 → 2317.06] exciting at the apple fall event Luke no well there's a new iPad there's a new iPad Air that
[2317.06 → 2324.80] as far as I can tell makes the iPad Pro basically irrelevant because it's got the a14 chipset it's five
[2324.80 → 2331.70] nanometre so it's high performance it's got a retina display up to 500 nits so you should get
[2331.70 → 2338.38] actually a pretty compelling HDR experience from it uh USB type c sweet same camera as the iPad Pro
[2338.38 → 2344.46] stereo speakers and landscape hey look USB c is a good feature just because apple's a little late to
[2344.46 → 2349.56] the party doesn't mean that we shouldn't applaud them for it Wi-Fi 6 Apple Pencil support, and it's
[2349.56 → 2357.46] 599 for the 64 gig model that's right my friends uh, uh a tablet in the year 2020 that still has only
[2357.46 → 2364.58] 64 gigs of storage thank you apple 600 to apple's credit can I take a moment to appreciate something
[2364.58 → 2374.12] about apple here sure this is a mid-tier device okay that ships with a flagship processor meanwhile
[2374.12 → 2380.10] in android land everyone's trying to talk consumers into mid-tier processors
[2380.10 → 2388.28] yeah off you go I told him to share with you meanwhile in android land you've got like
[2388.28 → 2394.66] manufacturers trying to pitch mid-tier processors in premium devices and then apple's all like yeah
[2394.66 → 2398.58] look it doesn't have a ton of storage but realistically what do you need a bunch of storage in an iPad for
[2398.58 → 2402.64] like and that's a fair point because you shouldn't be taking pictures and videos on your iPad
[2402.64 → 2410.38] unless you're a jackass so hey you've got performance that is going to be good enough
[2410.38 → 2414.96] for probably the act like the five years that apple is likely to support this bloody device
[2414.96 → 2420.04] there is something to be said for that approach is apple making great margin on these devices
[2420.04 → 2429.18] absolutely but what do you think what do you think so almost no one even makes
[2429.18 → 2434.86] really tablets anymore and almost no one is really focusing on tablets anymore what do you think
[2434.86 → 2441.18] uh like how I guess what is not the right way to start that question how do you think tablets fit in
[2441.18 → 2449.06] with a market that in a lot of ways at least is showing interest in pushing quite heavily into not
[2449.06 → 2453.94] just massive phones but massive phones that have multiple screens um
[2453.94 → 2461.50] you know what I'm going to flip it around you tell me first
[2461.50 → 2470.26] i I don't really think it has ton that has a ton sorry the industry itself seems much less
[2470.26 → 2475.38] interested in tablets in general iPads being the only ones that anyone seems to care about at all
[2475.38 → 2482.24] um, and maybe they'll have that okay actually maybe it is a pretty big deal because if you're so into
[2482.24 → 2486.82] the apple space that you're buying an iPad you probably you're you have you don't have a multiscreen
[2486.82 → 2495.86] phone anyway yeah yep yeah it's actually a completely irrelevant conversation, but that said I don't think
[2495.86 → 2501.30] you have to be completely into the Apple ecosystem at all to have an iPad if I cared about have a tablet
[2501.30 → 2507.30] you probably have an iPad yeah if I cared about having an tablet at all I would have an iPad 100
[2507.30 → 2515.46] percent like there 's's no way like I want to straw poll the audience here sure because I mean
[2515.46 → 2521.54] even what was Samsung's latest galaxy Galaxy Tab sick something whatever it is
[2521.54 → 2527.62] looks great, but the problem with android tablets isn't the hardware there's great hardware out there i
[2527.62 → 2532.38] mean Samsung's been making beautiful android tablets for years and years and years the problem
[2532.38 → 2538.62] is the software they don't get a ton of updates on the OS side and the apps because Google doesn't
[2538.62 → 2545.06] push hard enough for app developers to make proper tablet versions of their apps they just aren't very
[2545.06 → 2551.56] good they don't make proper use of all the extra space at best and in some cases all they do is just
[2551.56 → 2559.88] like stretch it like it's not it's just not a better experience whereas on an iPad I mean I haven't owned
[2559.88 → 2566.68] one for daily driver use in a while but I do always remember just the app experience being thoughtful
[2566.68 → 2575.34] it's really designed to be used on iPad one thing I do wonder is as we see bigger and bigger android phones
[2575.34 → 2581.54] particularly with foldable devices is if that situation will change I mean the galaxy fold z2 is
[2581.54 → 2588.16] equivalent almost to what like a seven-inch tablet you are getting dangerously close to yeah your app is
[2588.16 → 2593.26] really not going to display properly on this thing if you don't make some changes to it and those changes
[2593.26 → 2599.88] would likely translate very well to a tablet the problem is that from my experience the galaxy fold z2
[2599.88 → 2604.44] has not been particular, or the fold series has not been particularly well-supported even YouTube
[2604.44 → 2610.76] still as of a few weeks ago anyway didn't have support for stories on it which is the reason I can't daily
[2610.76 → 2615.58] drive it because I need to both check our stories and I need to be able to upload new ones and I don't
[2615.58 → 2620.76] feel like carrying around a secondary phone for that I'm not sure if that's been fixed on the fold z2
[2620.76 → 2627.78] because Samsung still hasn't gotten me one um but I guess I'll figure it out eventually yay
[2627.78 → 2633.48] in uh do you have your straw poll ready do you want me to move on to the next thing while you do that
[2633.48 → 2641.10] it's been posted already we already have some votes um right now i the question was are you a tablet
[2641.10 → 2647.30] customer then there are three responses one was yes I will buy one in the next two years one was yes i
[2647.30 → 2653.18] own one that I bought in the last two years and then the last answer was no, and it seems like the
[2653.18 → 2660.34] majority of the audience said no but not by a massive amount it's like 49 percent of people
[2660.34 → 2668.74] said one of the yeses for being a tablet customer yeah here can I get the link to that so I can show
[2668.74 → 2672.30] it on stream uh yes give me one moment sweet
[2672.30 → 2682.90] like are you a tablet customer me no definitely I've literally never bought a tablet why not
[2682.90 → 2691.22] why would I I don't know it's like because your eyesight sucks and your phone is small
[2691.22 → 2700.18] in my I would always be happy to lug something bigger around in order to have a keyboard
[2700.18 → 2705.32] I see yeah, but it's a tablet the keyboard even though it's bigger is actually worse
[2705.32 → 2711.32] I type like an order well not an order of magnitude but like twice as fast twice as fast on a phone as i
[2711.32 → 2716.74] do on a tablet for sure especially with like a well-trained autocorrect that's why I don't
[2716.74 → 2721.54] want a tablet yeah that's fair that's fair I get it because like and I agree with that exact statement
[2721.54 → 2726.88] if I'm is I'm just firing off quick and messy messages yeah I'd rather do it on a phone because
[2726.88 → 2732.28] I'm going to go really quick and like people are probably going to be able to understand my typos
[2732.28 → 2736.48] and my weird autocorrects and whatever it doesn't matter uh and I can just fire through stuff
[2736.48 → 2742.68] really quick if I'm trying to do like messaging style productivity when I'm not at my desktop
[2742.68 → 2748.84] or my laptop isn't fully set up my phone is always going to be way better so what am I going to do on
[2748.84 → 2755.16] a tablet for me, it would be like watch something Netflix yeah and then the priority level of that is
[2755.16 → 2762.20] like really low yeah who cares like I can do that on whatever like I'll, I'll find a way maybe I can
[2762.20 → 2768.78] find a bigger screen or I can't, and it's still on my phone cool i who cares like it's hey I'm not
[2768.78 → 2774.92] going to buy an expensive device for that I've been meaning to ask you own a TV now for the first
[2774.92 → 2782.56] time in like years has that changed your habits at all do you actually watch TV like on the TV
[2782.56 → 2790.56] no i kind of didn't think it would so you blew like two grand on a TV you don't watch
[2790.56 → 2796.68] Emma loves it okay happy wife happy life
[2796.68 → 2805.16] there are some investment one makes not for themselves all right uh in other news uh apple
[2805.16 → 2810.46] launched honestly I think the watches were far more exciting so the new watch series six measures
[2810.46 → 2816.16] blood oxygen in 15 seconds and can track oxygen saturation during sleep which is totally useless
[2816.16 → 2820.34] because there's no way of charging it while you sleep so that's really stupid um you know maybe
[2820.34 → 2825.56] someday there'll be a wearable that has like sleep monitoring features that doesn't need to be charged
[2825.56 → 2831.10] at night but until that time I guess I will completely ignore these kinds of innovations it has a better
[2831.10 → 2834.98] always on display that's more efficient and two and a half times brighter than the previous generation
[2834.98 → 2841.28] the altimeter is always on oh I always want to know how high I am there's emoji faces defence of
[2841.28 → 2846.08] the blood oxygen while you sleep thing yes if you're someone who actually kind of needs that
[2846.08 → 2849.52] then you could charge during the day or get two just buy two
[2849.52 → 2859.62] why not okay now that is an innovation apple free of charge okay you guys come up with the Apple Watch
[2859.62 → 2865.90] series six squared it's just a two pack you wear one at night one in the morning, and they just sync to
[2865.90 → 2871.82] each other so that it's like a perfectly seamless experience I could totally see people doing it so
[2871.82 → 2878.14] you never have to take off your Apple Watch the night one could even be like styled a little
[2878.14 → 2884.80] different yeah like it could not even have a display so it's like it's like a companion oh they
[2884.80 → 2891.50] should totally do it they should actually do it and softer materials yeah it's not like gonna
[2891.50 → 2898.18] oh do anything bad I know no one from apple watches this show but guys you've got to do it
[2898.18 → 2905.96] the like Apple Watch pm something like that like the one that's like that's great oh man that's a
[2905.96 → 2911.32] fantastic name I mean I don't think they take you know ideas from outside the company because they
[2911.32 → 2915.38] must not be good ideas because if you had good ideas surely you would already work at apple but
[2915.38 → 2921.42] like it's a perfect idea like with my wireless charger on my nightstand that would talk because the
[2921.42 → 2927.78] problem with health devices is that they don't work unless they're really part of your routine
[2927.78 → 2934.08] they don't work if you use them sometimes so I could totally make that part even being a totally
[2934.08 → 2939.72] absent-minded Magog that I am I could totally make that part of my routine I get up in the morning
[2939.72 → 2945.44] I switch my watch-out, and you know what the pm one could even have like pretty decent battery life
[2945.44 → 2950.24] like the daytime one so if I like forgot for a few hours and switched it at that time it wouldn't miss
[2950.24 → 2955.48] a beat get it miss a beat because heart rate monitoring anyway the point is so I get up in the
[2955.48 → 2962.62] morning feeling like P. Diddy got my it doesn't matter uh I get up in the morning I switch my watch I go to
[2962.62 → 2968.30] bed I switch my watch it's genius anyway there's a new loop it's flexible silicone 20 faster charging
[2968.30 → 2976.46] five gigahertz Wi-Fi finally uh u1 chip for spatial awareness, and it's 400 bucks for the GPS model it's
[2976.46 → 2981.56] pretty reasonable I guess we've come a long way from the addition you know a thousand plus dollar
[2981.56 → 2987.94] however much they charge for that thing and then there's the watch see which is under 300 has the
[2987.94 → 2993.84] series 5 SOC so the s5 does not have the blood oxygen sensor but otherwise has the same screen and
[2993.84 → 2998.02] sensors it's the series 6 and there's no power adapter in the box which for me wouldn't matter
[2998.02 → 3003.82] because I actually have a combo charger that I really like so it's wireless for phone AirPods
[3003.82 → 3008.32] pros and apple watches its ironic out of my three mobile devices that I carry every day
[3008.32 → 3012.56] two of them are apple even though I do not use an iPhone
[3012.56 → 3020.96] oh and now apple's bundling their subscription services whatever all right let's talk about the
[3020.96 → 3028.98] other the other big one from this week NVIDIA poised to purchase arm for 40 billion dollars
[3028.98 → 3035.44] that's doing with a b price is also pretty big all right let's do that first so who do you think won
[3035.44 → 3042.84] who do you think won the prize battle here Xbox why the subscription thing is just insane
[3042.84 → 3051.20] and like the the width disc drive price is the same as the series x so like okay PS5 without
[3051.20 → 3059.38] the disc drive you get the full fat except the disc drive for 399 which is pretty fantastic
[3059.38 → 3062.06] 100 cheaper than either flagship console
[3062.06 → 3073.24] I strongly disagree you think PS5 wins I think PS5 won I think the all digital PS5
[3073.24 → 3078.50] so here's the thing because remember it's not like Sony doesn't have a game subscription service to
[3078.50 → 3086.18] Microsoft's pricing outstanding, but they don't have exclusive games even temporarily exclusive
[3086.18 → 3091.14] they don't have exclusive games that would entice me to go buy it you just said the price war
[3091.14 → 3096.98] I did well you're the one who brought up the subscriptions I didn't bring up the subscriptions
[3096.98 → 3102.88] from a hardware standpoint I think it is indisputable that Sony what you're making that face
[3102.88 → 3109.64] I don't like that face that's a rude face and I won't see it I won't have it I won't have it I won't
[3109.64 → 3113.40] have it I'm getting rid of you I'm getting rid of you hold on where's your no you're gone you're done
[3113.40 → 3118.62] you're out get one of the consoles no you're done subscription no you keep putting you keep
[3118.62 → 3123.90] pushing you keep pushing I'm going to mute you too who's got the obs now
[3123.90 → 3133.10] all right you're back you're back your back live subscription what is that okay uh hold on hold
[3133.10 → 3136.34] on a second hold on a second I'm trying to remember okay, okay okay if you want to play an
[3136.34 → 3143.10] online game you have to have uh what's it called on PlayStation yeah so Pia PlayStation plus
[3143.10 → 3147.70] collection was announced so PS5 owners with PS5 plus will be able to download and play a curated
[3147.70 → 3152.42] library of PS4 games that defined the generation like batman Arkham knight blood-borne fallout 4 god
[3152.42 → 3160.10] of war monster hunter world persona 5 and many more so they've got great content out of the gate
[3160.10 → 3165.70] whereas Microsoft as you pointed out is essentially giving away a free console with your subscription to
[3165.70 → 3174.10] the maybe a slightly more mediocre content but where I think Sony got it right is actually
[3174.10 → 3180.06] very closely in line with what I said was so great about apple's approach with the new iPad Air
[3180.06 → 3188.02] what you're getting with the PlayStation 5 digital edition so the one that does not have the disc drive
[3188.02 → 3196.52] is for 400 for less than the price of a series x or a full fat PS5 you are getting next generation
[3196.52 → 3202.62] performance in terms of the actual performance bang for the buck if we're to take Microsoft's word for
[3202.62 → 3209.56] the teraflops of the series s versus the series x you are getting the best bang for the buck out of the
[3209.56 → 3214.90] next generation consoles bar none making it the most future-proof purchase out of the lot of them
[3214.90 → 3224.38] that is my argument so I think one thing here is are you going only single player game because now
[3224.38 → 3228.82] now we're including the games well if you played competitive games, and you actually cared about
[3228.82 → 3235.68] performing well you'd have a pc with a 120 hertz display no, no okay, okay okay, okay okay, okay and I was
[3235.68 → 3246.80] just being rude um so for me, I would say that I would be more likely to sit in my couch and play a
[3246.80 → 3252.50] single player game with a controller I would be less likely to play anything competitive I know so like
[3252.50 → 3262.40] the reason why I think Xbox One is specifically not for you because I get like when I'm looking at
[3262.40 → 3268.72] this and I'm and I'm thinking Xbox One I'm thinking uh households where the kids are trying to
[3268.72 → 3274.24] convince the parents or the or one of the parents is trying to convince the other parent like you're
[3274.24 → 3279.36] you're trying to pitch it to someone if you go like oh it's its 30 bucks a month that's quite
[3279.36 → 3287.70] digestible versus 400 for a long time there the like oh a household or individual with no kids can
[3287.70 → 3293.74] save up roughly this much money on splurge purchases thing that was roughed in at 300 bucks 299
[3293.74 → 3298.80] yeah for a long time that was a big discussion we had around I believe the last console launch
[3298.80 → 3304.22] you're right they've cranked that up by a hundred dollars the average income of most people has not
[3304.22 → 3314.70] increased like at all yeah so like it is less digestible at 399 than they were when they were at 299
[3314.70 → 3322.82] it just is even if the 399 price is very competitive against what Xbox has yeah as their hard prices i
[3322.82 → 3328.36] don't think what Xbox is really pushing forward is their hard prices and if you're buying one of these
[3328.36 → 3336.90] I think in most cases it is probably your singular gaming machine i I'm assuming i actually I don't know
[3336.90 → 3344.62] this, but like when I was growing up we usually either had like really nicely specced computers
[3344.62 → 3349.24] and we were kind of a little out of date on the console side of things, or we were up-to-date on
[3349.24 → 3352.46] the console side of things, and we were a little out of date on the computer side of things most
[3352.46 → 3359.90] families cannot yeah most families cannot afford to like to have the whole stable of you know current
[3359.90 → 3367.06] gen consoles and a nice gaming pc that's not reasonable and like my dad was pretty good
[3367.06 → 3374.58] at uh at like that's not the right phrasing my dad pushed forward consoles a fair amount um which makes
[3374.58 → 3380.40] sense family setting we all sit on the couch we play games together it was really cool um and then a lot
[3380.40 → 3388.50] of like my personal money went into my computer so but we I like that was very a big focus for me etc
[3388.50 → 3393.32] I think most households are going to have kind of one and if you're buying like a brand-new console
[3393.32 → 3398.02] it's probably going to be one so it's 400 bucks which is really hard to digest and if that's your
[3398.02 → 3403.36] singular thing, and you want to play games online with your friends you are getting what's looking like
[3403.36 → 3409.04] 12 bucks a month subscription for PS plus and I don't think that comes with games because I think
[3409.04 → 3415.82] you need PlayStation now for games I don't know I'm not I don't know PlayStation add-ons well PS plus
[3415.82 → 3424.70] comes with some PS4 games okay um sure and then PlayStation now comes with more stuff I don't
[3424.70 → 3428.68] really know how the PlayStation stuff works, but you're spending at least 12 bucks additional so
[3428.68 → 3434.88] PlayStation now is cloud gaming if you are okay, okay yeah so if you subscribe for longer periods
[3434.88 → 3439.24] of time if you subscribe for three months at a time it's 30 bucks six months at a time it's 70 bucks
[3439.24 → 3445.48] um so you get some discounts there but not, not massive ones just fairly reasonable discounts for
[3445.48 → 3452.08] subscribing in bigger amounts of time so probably let's say about 12 bucks a month so all right okay
[3452.08 → 3459.12] in 10 months in 10 months the Xbox costs less all right I think it's fair to say that there's a console
[3459.12 → 3465.04] for everyone because if I'm more of like a single player experience person I might actually care more
[3465.04 → 3473.86] about PlayStation plus than I do about Microsoft service and I think that the PlayStation 5 disc list
[3473.86 → 3479.54] like the digital edition makes a ton of sense for me because I'm sitting there I'm playing more like
[3479.54 → 3485.74] sightseeing type games beautiful games that are meant to be enjoyed on the latest hardware uh Sony was
[3485.74 → 3492.30] very clear that they investigated they explored the idea of a lower spec PS5 and rejected it because
[3492.30 → 3499.16] they didn't like what it would mean for the game development process um and I think they were right
[3499.16 → 3504.50] yeah I think they were right about that but then I think Microsoft is coming at it from a completely
[3504.50 → 3510.12] different point of view where like you said it's like this is the family it's the Xbox it's the box
[3510.12 → 3515.64] it's that box that's for gaming or whatever so you got your subscription fee it's practically free
[3515.64 → 3520.92] uh the controllers are cheap because you could go pick up like secondhand Xbox One controllers at
[3520.92 → 3526.26] game stop when they go out of business down the street um so it's meant to be this like affordable
[3526.26 → 3533.04] affordable box um that's maybe more I don't want to say casual because that has such a
[3533.04 → 3539.14] negative connotation, but it's certainly a less uh a less fraught purchase like you don't have to think
[3539.14 → 3548.44] about it quite so hard be more common to find the new boxes in cheaper overall setups yes that makes
[3548.44 → 3555.96] um so like i yeah I don't I don't think the PS5 is positioned necessarily poorly I think what you
[3555.96 → 3560.72] brought up like the possibility of someone getting the console and not getting PlayStation now
[3560.72 → 3566.80] actually seems decently high yeah it seems pretty high like if I had 400 bucks to spend
[3566.80 → 3572.70] or 500 let's say because I might want to buy a game or something maybe uh so I get a PlayStation 5
[3572.70 → 3578.62] I get one controller that comes with it because I'm not going to buy another fancy 70 controller or
[3578.62 → 3586.06] whatever and I get and one game that I like really want to play i I buy oh man what are the launch
[3586.06 → 3593.16] titles again there's really not much even on the PlayStation side who uh oh man is Hogwarts legacy
[3593.16 → 3599.14] even launching with the game or with the console I don't know I don't know demon souls
[3599.14 → 3604.06] maybe in the dock they have some goods PlayStation has been fantastic on the single
[3604.06 → 3608.90] player game set of things so I legitimately see the use case of buying the digital ones you save 100
[3608.90 → 3615.22] bucks yeah some single player games over the life cycle of the console yeah enjoying it a lot and just
[3615.22 → 3619.28] seeing it off with that not really worrying about PlayStation now not really, really worrying about
[3619.28 → 3624.68] PlayStation plus if you're on the Xbox side of things I really see getting the subscription model
[3624.68 → 3630.88] console yeah getting in on those multiplayer games with your friends Microsoft don't have as many
[3630.88 → 3637.30] exclusives and stuff Microsoft is going hard on the whole just like commoditizing it turning it into a
[3637.30 → 3643.06] box and I think that that might cause some friction with game developers I've already seen some backlash
[3643.06 → 3646.84] about the fact that they have two different specs, so now game developers have to target
[3646.84 → 3653.76] PlayStation Xbox the high-end one Xbox the low-end one probably for the time being they've got to hit
[3653.76 → 3659.32] PlayStation and Xbox last gen both high-end and low-end all of a sudden they're basically developed
[3659.32 → 3667.84] I mean when you think about how few graphics cards there are that make up like the um kind of like
[3667.84 → 3672.62] let's say the lion's share of the steam hardware survey right because going back to anything older
[3672.62 → 3678.98] than like five years ago there's not much AMD has what like 20 market share if that and that's among
[3678.98 → 3686.08] like sort of architecturally like two or three cards so NVIDIA basically has liked their handful
[3686.08 → 3690.92] of GPUs for each generation like we're at the point now we're supporting a console you're actually
[3690.92 → 3696.90] targeting maybe I'd say a third as many performance tiers as you are on the pc remember that assumes
[3696.90 → 3702.62] you're only looking at graphics and things like system memory and CPU speed and number of cores can also
[3702.62 → 3707.86] vary wildly on the pc, but there are trends that you can find so it's like I can see how developers
[3707.86 → 3712.08] are getting a little frustrated with that but I think Microsoft's going to continue to double down
[3712.08 → 3718.26] on it, I think that we could start to see more frequent Xbox refreshes I think that's why it's
[3718.26 → 3727.18] called series not because it's just series you know x and s I think it's series because just like they
[3727.18 → 3734.40] turned Windows 10 into operating system as a service I think they're turning Xbox into Xbox as a service
[3734.40 → 3741.80] so we could just see yeah series x2 next year two years from now you know whenever AMD pulls their
[3741.80 → 3745.84] head out of their butt and makes a new graphics card worth upgrading to boom two years from now
[3745.84 → 3753.00] exactly every two years that would be a full subscription of a console every time yep that
[3753.00 → 3757.84] could very well be the model looking at how Microsoft has priced it so that you buy the console
[3757.84 → 3765.84] in two years so that way even though they don't have to what they could do is put a ton of pressure
[3765.84 → 3773.30] on Sony because Sony's business model is not designed to compete with that so all of a sudden Microsoft
[3773.30 → 3780.18] would be leapfrogging them multiple times a generation in console performance potentially without
[3780.18 → 3786.44] necessarily changing much on the game developer side of things because everything's focused on like
[3786.44 → 3792.34] direct x right so it's just a matter of like here's more performance I mean you were going to
[3792.34 → 3798.30] develop for pc because it's cross-platform anyway so here's a faster pc it's a new box don't worry too
[3798.30 → 3805.08] much about what's inside it this is like this is the 4k box this is the 4k 60 fps box this is the 8k box
[3805.08 → 3811.74] as time goes on, and it's its basically just like your settings in game are just pre-selected for
[3811.74 → 3818.30] you because it can detect what console you're on it's basically GeForce experience yeah right it just
[3818.30 → 3823.56] detects what you're running on and is like yeah that seems about right so now that you see the PS5
[3823.56 → 3833.36] pricing 499 399 yeah no weird subscription thing like Xbox did what do you think about the positioning of
[3833.36 → 3842.48] Xbox in terms of pricing because they have that 299 thing I think that I mentioned I think it's a
[3842.48 → 3851.98] great time to be a gamer straight up I think between the RTX 3000 series outstanding for pc
[3851.98 → 3857.98] gamers I'm not just people who have 700 to spend on a graphics card not at all not in the slightest
[3857.98 → 3864.76] because it's going to absolutely tank the prices of pascal and Turing graphics cards never mind
[3864.76 → 3872.36] maxwell, and you can still do a lot of gaming on a 980 or a 980 ti do not kid yourself, and it is going
[3872.36 → 3877.68] to utterly destroy the secondhand pricing of those cards for people who don't have a ton of money
[3877.68 → 3883.32] not to mention prompt a lot of people to upgrade to the new ones and flood the market with those parts
[3883.32 → 3890.94] great time to be a gamer um PlayStation 5 honestly looks great Xbox Series X and series s
[3890.94 → 3896.68] honestly they look great just totally huge innovations in the game development side of things
[3896.68 → 3902.76] uh so we're going to see better game design thanks to these faster SSDs we're going to see um what was
[3902.76 → 3906.54] I going to say right we're going to see more affordability for gamers than ever before with the
[3906.54 → 3911.40] subscription model from Microsoft like there has it's never been a better time to be a gamer that's
[3911.40 → 3921.06] that's what I'll say today meanwhile Nintendo's like hey guys we have AR we have augmented reality
[3921.06 → 3927.22] Mario Kart hello they made some statement that they're like working on a new console
[3927.22 → 3932.92] duh or like they confirmed like yes we are in fact doing anything
[3932.92 → 3941.22] I mean you can take that for granted my understanding of the game console development cycle is that
[3941.22 → 3947.48] you're basically working on the next console as soon as you have two seconds to catch your breath
[3947.48 → 3954.18] from launching the last one like like like 20 of the team stays on to keep writing like you know
[3954.18 → 3959.50] firmware updates and stuff for the existing ones and the rest is like okay let's build it from scratch
[3959.50 → 3965.26] again yeah maybe more than 20 but you I think you guys get my point new console development
[3965.26 → 3974.62] never ends if you want to have any hope of staying competitive i i think the PS5 is
[3974.62 → 3982.04] in my opinion targeted as like the the almost the the like wealthy person I think it's more
[3982.04 → 3988.20] premium 100 yep and I think Xbox is like the pleb console for sure in terms of the way that
[3988.20 → 3995.10] Sony and Microsoft see it not me you're hitting the one-time payment digestible 299
[3995.10 → 4000.72] which due to wages not really increasing is the same digestible amount it was last time and they
[4000.72 → 4004.94] hit it again that's probably why the reason why they wanted a spec down console and even though
[4004.94 → 4009.22] there was pushback they did it anyway yeah folks they wanted to hit that 299 they want that commodity
[4009.22 → 4015.62] they want that commodity pricing they have the more premium one as well just because they got to hit
[4015.62 → 4020.08] those they got to be able to promote those performance numbers need those headlines I just won't make it
[4020.08 → 4024.60] so just make it, and then they have their two subscription things which are super digestible
[4024.60 → 4030.48] even the high-end 49 console on subscription is much more digestible and then PS5 is just sitting
[4030.48 → 4036.64] over there like no screw subscriptions, and you're paying a minimum of 400 bucks games cost a lot to make
[4036.64 → 4043.94] go buy them can i can I say something controversial right now we are way over time on the show today we
[4043.94 → 4048.46] haven't even gone through super chats but i have to i have to hit you with this okay I'm gonna I want to say
[4048.46 → 4054.96] something controversial right now do it I'm ready Nintendo Switch pro assuming that they're actually
[4054.96 → 4061.14] working on such a thing could be the most compelling of all of them of course here's why here's why
[4061.14 → 4069.96] not to you, I guess fanboy no, no no, no no, no hold on but for a reason you're not expecting
[4069.96 → 4075.88] for a reason you're not expecting though okay for a reason you're not expecting because in addition to
[4075.88 → 4083.14] having a more powerful SOC I think that it is basically a guarantee that it will include the
[4083.14 → 4088.50] crazy up sampling technology that NVIDIA has been working on over the last few years
[4088.50 → 4096.56] so Nintendo could conceivably ship like a portable console that like games at 4k
[4096.56 → 4106.28] because it could render at like 1080p seamlessly up sample to 4k and absolutely blow the console
[4106.28 → 4113.50] gaming world's mind because AMD's technology when it comes to upscaling is so far behind NVIDIA's that
[4113.50 → 4119.52] it's not even they're not even competing on the same planet at this point like have you seen what
[4119.52 → 4128.56] the shield pro can do would you want it 4k in your hand I think I wouldn't yeah it wouldn't have to
[4128.56 → 4133.34] be I wouldn't care about that, but they actually build some real tech into their dock this time
[4133.34 → 4138.64] and do an upscale in the dock no because they don't have to the upscale would definitely be in
[4138.64 → 4146.00] the SOC like there's no way it wouldn't be, and the thing too is that the switch could benefit from
[4146.00 → 4152.88] upscaling without upscaling to 4k so they could ship a 1080p display in the switch it could have
[4152.88 → 4158.94] smaller bezels could have a nice big screen like we're overdue for a huge screen on a switch
[4158.94 → 4167.20] so a giant screen, and then it could render it like 720p or like 800p or something so you could take
[4167.20 → 4174.90] advantage of DSS of this super sampling technology but just in different ways so on your TV you're taking
[4174.90 → 4181.04] advantage of it to like to get this crystal clear super sharp image at your on your 4k TV and in your
[4181.04 → 4189.02] hand you're using it to save power by rendering it a lower resolution like that's that's crazy
[4189.02 → 4196.86] that's crazy so i that's that's what I want to see that's what I want to see that's i I agree with
[4196.86 → 4203.84] that I honestly think another switch would fly off the shelves even if they just made it like a little
[4203.84 → 4211.70] faster yeah and like maybe a little bit better battery life Bluetooth headphones maybe green had
[4211.70 → 4218.30] a little bit better coverage like it has Bluetooth would make yeah dude it having Bluetooth and
[4218.30 → 4223.58] not supporting Bluetooth headphones some of the most frustrating things ever so like yeah solving like a
[4223.58 → 4228.88] few of those problems and just making it a little bit better in each way um I wouldn't even be surprised
[4228.88 → 4235.10] if they added like a c stick or something um yeah people would eat it up because it's just it's
[4235.10 → 4244.38] Nintendo all right so I think we're probably going to have to call it for the stream for today ladies
[4244.38 → 4251.50] and gentlemen the arm thing oh yeah shoot okay we'll do that very quickly ticktock, and we chat officially
[4251.50 → 4257.88] banned in the U.S. as of September 20th so that's the thing uh and NVIDIA wants to purchase arm to
[4257.88 → 4264.48] basically become a fully integrated AI company so they would have CPU network and GPU basically
[4264.48 → 4270.66] making themselves a one-stop shop for the data centre uh don't worry this won't affect um you know
[4270.66 → 4278.90] perpetual license arm licensees like apple um so that'll be fine, but it's going to be real interesting
[4278.90 → 4286.84] to see apple like beholden to NVIDIA in any way because those two get along so well uh one last thing I have
[4286.84 → 4292.80] to talk about real quick here is lttstore.com is hiring it's going real successful ladies and
[4292.80 → 4296.76] gentlemen by the way thank you for your support we're going to have a video coming up pretty soon
[4296.76 → 4303.84] called how does leg make money v 2.0 uh so the last time we did that was four years ago and things have
[4303.84 → 4310.24] changed a lot some things have stayed the same a lot other things have changed a lot um you guys are
[4310.24 → 4316.08] going to want to check that out, but a big part of our growth has been the super fans the ones that
[4316.08 → 4321.44] uh subscribe on float plane the ones that uh buy stuff through our affiliate links in the video
[4321.44 → 4329.14] descriptions the ones that buy merch you guys are absolutely enormous um in terms of the amount like
[4329.14 → 4334.96] the percentage of revenue that you guys uh contribute uh people who subscribe to YouTube premium for
[4334.96 → 4340.34] example huge difference uh so you guys have been enormous difference makers for us over the last
[4340.34 → 4346.24] four years compared to uh how our model used to work before and thank you very, very much because you
[4346.24 → 4351.78] I think you guys probably sort of realize how much of a difference that you make not just to us but
[4351.78 → 4357.44] to any other creators that you follow and that you support directly, but you might not realize how much
[4357.44 → 4368.00] pretty huge it's massive um so anyway we're hiring six positions graphic design fashion design patterns
[4368.00 → 4374.78] making we want to like triple down on custom garments uh product management customer support and web dev is
[4374.78 → 4383.00] that six one two three four five six yep uh and web devs web devs so we're looking for react JS
[4383.00 → 4388.96] experience uh so you guys can find those on linusmediagroup.com now uh for five of them and the
[4388.96 → 4395.34] dev possession dev position will be listed within a few days to go check it out web dev position is
[4395.34 → 4404.92] mostly it's like JavaScript and uh a lot of like web front end stuff okay um one additional thing I'm
[4404.92 → 4410.90] going to throw in here is that uh I don't know exactly how we're going to do this and uh to call it
[4410.90 → 4418.52] hiring you'd need some pretty serious air quotes uh because you're not getting paid but the LTT forum
[4418.52 → 4425.98] probably needs some developer help um colonel Morris could use some reinforcements I'm not sure how we're
[4425.98 → 4432.94] necessarily going to do this yet yeah how would we vet people yeah um to be clear the forum's not like a
[4432.94 → 4437.86] money-making thing for us either it's just something that we want to continue to support because we feel
[4437.86 → 4442.90] like it's really important to have and I've had people question me on this before because I describe
[4442.90 → 4450.66] it as like an independent community like yes we're in control of it, but there are actually people on
[4450.66 → 4456.00] there with very high post counts that like don't even really watch anymore or care yeah we exert
[4456.00 → 4463.84] very little force on the forum the only thing is like the basic uh you know community guidelines
[4463.84 → 4469.70] which is your know don't be a dick and be excellent to each other that's that's pretty much it and keep
[4469.70 → 4477.06] it on tech topic that that's like the three basic rules there um and there 's's not a lot of
[4477.06 → 4483.64] forums left that are thriving the way that Lt Linus tech tips forum is so guys uh if you feel
[4483.64 → 4488.50] like you want to help like maybe you're a member there and you feel like you have some experience that
[4488.50 → 4492.90] would be helpful just uh how are you getting in touch with people should they contact
[4492.90 → 4497.22] again we don't necessarily know yet I'm just putting the feelers out there, so people know okay
[4497.22 → 4502.16] the type of stuff they're looking for is front-end uh designer and developer should ideally be kind
[4502.16 → 4507.74] of one person and some like sysadmin back-end developer stuff basically colonel Morris has been
[4507.74 → 4514.44] doing essentially all of this on his own for a very long time um and that is becoming less and less
[4514.44 → 4522.80] feasible uh we're we're looking to expand huge community it's like well over 10 million posts
[4522.80 → 4531.62] like actually for real um i have written uh letters of recommendation for people that have
[4531.62 → 4537.50] like actually helped them get into some cool stuff uh if it's not a paying position
[4537.50 → 4543.72] because it's a community forum that doesn't make money um and like we could make it make money
[4543.72 → 4548.94] like we could cover it in video ads and stuff, but we're not going to do that because we want it to
[4548.94 → 4555.74] just be its own thing so all you'll find on it is like one banner ad at the top right and then links
[4555.74 → 4562.20] to the latest Ltd videos over on like bottom right and then one banner ad at the bottom that's it so
[4562.20 → 4566.50] like there is some responsibilities that would come with it but for the most part it would be more of a
[4566.50 → 4573.60] fun side project that you can kind of work on when you want um it's yeah it's so just
[4573.60 → 4579.28] if you're interested keep an eye out there will be there will be something coming soon for people
[4579.28 → 4584.32] to be able to apply in some way I don't know all right thanks Luke uh we should do a few super chats
[4584.32 → 4591.04] here uh sorry guys I'm not going to have time for all of them as usual uh thanks Robert mail um
[4591.04 → 4601.26] have a little unity IPO cash says Anthony Markham did unity just IPO you have to be kidding me how did I
[4601.26 → 4609.28] not see this unity technologies raises more than 1.3 billion in IPO 12 hours ago look at that
[4609.28 → 4616.52] wow how did I not know that they man I wish i uh I wish that it wasn't such an enormous actually
[4616.52 → 4620.48] would that even be a conflict of interest for me, I don't even cover their stuff yeah probably yeah
[4620.48 → 4627.22] yeah oh well I own no stocks just saying wow that's crazy it went up like 42 percent
[4627.22 → 4634.44] yeah it's pretty nuts uh Owen Cullen says per the dm on Twitter please um flag mental health among all
[4634.44 → 4642.22] age groups don't even mention me I don't care oh uh I'm a little confused I don't think I read that dm
[4642.22 → 4650.62] it is a shared inbox but um yes mental health issues definitely important among all age groups I mean
[4650.62 → 4659.10] can't disagree with that uh cell phone archaeology says so review a RTX 8000 squadron versus the 3080
[4659.10 → 4667.26] already really I need to know wait for ampere squadron there's no way that's not coming patience
[4667.26 → 4675.44] all right Tommy gun 1928 says Linus some people say you just make merch to avoid buying clothes
[4675.44 → 4683.54] what is your response my response that is totally unfair I also do it to avoid Luke buying clothes
[4683.54 → 4687.96] yes, thank you're welcome it's great
[4687.96 → 4696.76] someone in my friend group mentioned the other day they were like why do you still do Sancho and I was
[4696.76 → 4701.68] like it's really fun and I like hang out with Linus like what do you mean they're like you don't
[4701.68 → 4706.18] you don't get anything from it, I was like do you not see all the clothes that I wear
[4706.18 → 4713.80] and water bottles and water bottles and everything else I'm like there are perks
[4713.80 → 4719.30] okay leave me alone we got to do a Luke personal rig update though for sure we got to do one we got
[4719.30 → 4727.84] to do one we're overdue some ideas up actually we're overdue i i i um intel extreme rig upgrade i uh i
[4727.84 → 4733.30] vetoed including you in that uh because I told them that we're probably just going to do something for
[4733.30 → 4738.40] Luke separately anyway because you're at the point now where it's getting to be upgrade time so well
[4738.40 → 4744.14] let's let's let's chat uh there's finally new GPUs there's new CPUs coming so let's try and time it so
[4744.14 → 4748.38] that it's like okay Luke doesn't need to upgrade his computer for another like five years or whatever
[4748.38 → 4756.28] because that's the cycle I'm trying to my thing is I got i have to find something cool to do with it
[4756.28 → 4762.80] I think we could come up with something yeah I've been ramping up my thought process there and
[4762.80 → 4768.24] I've had a few ideas but nothing that's like really sold me so far so all right sounds good
[4768.24 → 4776.28] uh dr aero says I'm going to buy AMD no matter what NVIDIA can and I think it's bleeped out
[4776.28 → 4780.92] all right fair enough Gordon McPherson thanks for keeping posting during the pandemic you guys are
[4780.92 → 4785.40] awesome please buy some pizza for the team you know what sure we could do a pizza day why not I mean
[4785.40 → 4791.62] I think you underestimate the uh size of my team and the cost of that pizza but tell you what just
[4791.62 → 4797.74] for you, we will do we will celebrate the reopening of the new lounge with pizza for all some free
[4797.74 → 4803.96] advertising for a small company but Clayton gate pizza actually has like above I'm not going to say
[4803.96 → 4810.54] it's amazing, but it's above average pizza for very, very cheap all right cost-effective pizza party
[4810.54 → 4818.34] well still we've got like three dozen people, and it was like 48 so yeah we're going to need more
[4818.34 → 4822.22] pizzas, but that's okay that goes a long way, and we're going to do the pizza party don't you worry
[4822.22 → 4830.56] nice hey did you uh new left for dead new left for dead 2 map yeah what the heck right we're gonna
[4830.56 → 4834.50] have to play some left for dead 2 later anyway that's that's totally newsworthy that's not in a super chat
[4834.50 → 4844.46] um mike Collins I'm never making that video slushy 2080 ti to 3090 upgrade worth it or overkill I cannot
[4844.46 → 4852.46] comment the 3090 um review embargo is not up yet and I definitely know more than I can tell you
[4852.46 → 4860.56] oh, oh put the back nick says don't forget PS5 games cost ten dollars more now Sony is the only one
[4860.56 → 4864.36] making that move that's not going to sit well with some people even if the industry should have done it
[4864.36 → 4872.80] years ago that's a good point um Calvin says switch is my favourite switch is the console that to my
[4872.80 → 4877.92] mind has something to offer beyond exclusive games I mean mostly exclusive games come on but like
[4877.92 → 4883.22] yes that's true the mobility is cool all right that's it for super chats I think we're going to have
[4883.22 → 4887.62] to call it for the show today we are well over an hour and a half thank you guys for tuning in
[4887.62 → 4892.96] we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[4892.96 → 4903.28] what's up with the mouse thing which one your mouse is constantly over like my camera yeah it's
[4903.28 → 4910.12] because I put the window behind my uh my Chrome window that I use for like reading chat and
[4910.12 → 4914.58] looking at the document and stuff and then people pointed it out that it bothered them so I started
[4914.58 → 4921.38] doing it on purpose oh so what like the obs window uh no, no no it's over the uh
[4921.38 → 4922.02] you
