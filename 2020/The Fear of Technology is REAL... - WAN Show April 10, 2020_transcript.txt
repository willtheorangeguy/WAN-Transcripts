[0.00 --> 11.20]  welcome ladies and gentlemen it's time for the when show the remote when show
[11.20 --> 16.72]  the fourth one we filmed the best kind of when show wait what do you mean the fourth one we
[16.72 --> 20.70]  filmed today we filmed four last week we're not gonna have to film a wan show for like
[20.70 --> 26.72]  two months yeah this is gonna be great man it's it's just lucky that we have such an accurate
[26.72 --> 32.08]  crystal ball because otherwise we'd be in real trouble like two months from now when you know
[32.08 --> 37.94]  like in videos launching something or whatever and we're not talking about it because we're on top of
[37.94 --> 42.58]  this because all the hardware is so cyclical anyways that we just guess what it's gonna be
[42.58 --> 48.58]  yeah pretty much enough we just call everything rumors we say everything's allegedly yep yep we
[48.58 --> 53.62]  just move on allegedly is the key word it's the perfect word all right guys we've got a great
[53.62 --> 58.00]  show for you today you got a lot of great topics uh it's kind of a lie we don't really have a ton
[58.00 --> 64.44]  of great topics we definitely have the one about people setting fire to 5g towers because um because
[64.44 --> 69.32]  people are special um so that's that's great we're gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about the
[69.32 --> 73.40]  playstation 5 controller actually you might have some stuff to say about playstation 5 controller
[73.40 --> 79.54]  i suspect you will i have intentionally not looked at it because i knew we were gonna talk about it we're
[79.54 --> 85.36]  gonna get that raw reaction ladies and gentlemen yeah we've also got uh apple and google teaming up
[85.36 --> 93.72]  to use your data in the fight against covid and 800 gigabit per second ethernet spec has been announced
[93.72 --> 98.68]  yeah it's super that's a boring topic we might not even talk about that uh but also amd's fourth
[98.68 --> 105.96]  gen ryzen desktop chips are apparently set to release in september 2020 that's a bit of a more fun
[105.96 --> 111.48]  why is that under rapid fire uh i don't know that's sort of a big topic but you know as far as i can
[111.48 --> 116.64]  tell the difference between main topics and rapid fire is that someone flipped a coin and it landed on
[116.64 --> 121.66]  the right side or the wrong side they didn't have a ton of notes for it so they're just like oh yeah you
[121.66 --> 125.26]  know how you know how it is you know how it is so great great great show for you guys today we're
[125.26 --> 126.94]  gonna have a lot of fun and we're gonna roll that intro
[126.94 --> 138.94]  i promise we're going to you just wait it's gonna happen wait for it here it is it's coming
[138.94 --> 148.34]  now youtube not live no youtube youtube not live oh yeah it's because it's uh stupid uh so there we go
[148.34 --> 154.40]  so the issue with going live on youtube by the way thank you very much guys
[154.40 --> 160.64]  is that in order to use the same stream key which would be the intuitive way for a streaming
[160.64 --> 166.72]  thing to work um oh shoot i forgot to put the uh little lower third thing whatever it doesn't
[166.72 --> 171.66]  matter back to linus luke uh in order to reuse the same stream key which is how i would expect it to
[171.66 --> 176.18]  work that's how it works on twitch so it works on floatplane basically everywhere else um you have to
[176.18 --> 183.06]  like kind of copy paste your last live event that used that same stream key so what happens when you
[183.06 --> 190.12]  copy your last event is it also copies all the characteristics of it including the title and the
[190.12 --> 198.38]  fact that it's public so immediately it sends out a ping to people who follow you like hey we're going
[198.38 --> 205.94]  live and i'm not it would be great to have a second to say actually no i would like this to be
[205.94 --> 212.40]  unlisted or private for now while i get everything set up because you never know it might not be
[212.40 --> 217.94]  perfect immediately when we start um but no no that's not how the interface works and so then what
[217.94 --> 223.14]  happens is i go in and i set it to unlisted that's the first thing i do so that it's not just like
[223.14 --> 230.60]  spamming people with this event that doesn't exist and then um what i then do is i forget so i press go
[230.60 --> 235.58]  live but it's still set to unlisted but then there's all these people in the chat so i'm like oh okay
[235.58 --> 241.22]  everything's working normally but they're only there because it was temporarily public earlier on
[241.22 --> 247.50]  yeah so it's just the dumbest thing ever and i i the only fix is for youtube to fix their interface
[247.50 --> 253.70]  or me to become a super genius who can remember all these ridiculous steps that's annoying that's
[253.70 --> 260.26]  fine let's just just so you know as well apparently teams does have some auto gain features so i think
[260.26 --> 265.16]  that's more what we were running into apparently it does because we were definitely running into that
[265.16 --> 271.30]  like when i was taking um so we did a pre-stream testing uh over on twitch and floatplane and when
[271.30 --> 277.52]  we were trying to configure luke's audio to get to the right levels no matter how much i tried to boost
[277.52 --> 285.70]  him on my go xlr mixer thing um he wouldn't get any louder but and this is a dynamic mic yeah when i got
[285.70 --> 292.62]  further away i stayed the same volume yeah it's like really weird so what would happen was his voice
[292.62 --> 298.18]  wouldn't get any louder but i could hear like the cars driving by on the road which with a dynamic
[298.18 --> 305.38]  microphone should absolutely not be a thing like yeah it must be taking just this like tiny waveform
[305.38 --> 312.10]  and then just being like yeah that's exactly as important as the person talking right
[312.10 --> 317.12]  so we might i don't know we might have to switch to a different voice chat app for next week but the
[317.12 --> 321.48]  thing is the video quality on teams is reasonably good as long as you you know upgrade your camera at some
[321.48 --> 325.92]  point what cable is it that you need can i just send you a cable is it like a special cable luke
[325.92 --> 332.08]  i think so hold on it's just like a micro hdmi or something isn't it i bet it's just a micro hdmi cable
[332.08 --> 338.38]  probably no no no no i have that you have i found that and we could still hear you we could still hear
[338.38 --> 344.18]  you yelling from across the room just fine like i could hear you still so bizarre that should not be
[344.18 --> 348.42]  how that works so i have this guy which should be pretty good for the stream
[348.42 --> 354.52]  mm-hmm yeah it looks pretty good handy it looks handy i don't remember what the exact model is i'm
[354.52 --> 362.60]  sure i could find it somewhere hdr cx 900 um and i have the micro hdmi it's not even mini
[362.60 --> 369.44]  it's just freaking teeny i found that i only have one of those and i found that but i can't find it's
[369.44 --> 377.48]  dc in which is super unique oh there's your problem yeah that that's not working that's not working what
[377.48 --> 384.90]  you're doing but that's fine i understand it was it was worth it was worth a try um yeah okay so
[384.90 --> 390.22]  there's your problem yeah that's like that's like an ebay that's like an 80 dollar ebay special right
[390.22 --> 398.88]  there yeah yeah and i've i've somewhat given up trying to find it here um i checked every bin that
[398.88 --> 405.00]  should have cables in it and it wasn't there um and i've checked places where i don't normally store
[405.00 --> 410.20]  cables and didn't find it there either so of course the specs on bnh just say power cord
[410.20 --> 418.34]  yeah aren't you so glad that proprietary power connectors are going the way of the dodo right now
[418.34 --> 422.62]  yes because it's super and this is like particularly annoying problem i remember
[422.62 --> 430.24]  and this is the frustrating part i have one of these micro hdmis but i have two power cables for this
[430.24 --> 434.86]  because when i bought it i knew the power cable was going to be annoying the second i looked at it i was
[434.86 --> 443.04]  like yep that sucks so i didn't buy another like wall plug power cable i bought a usb to this proprietary
[443.04 --> 450.82]  end thing and it worked i've used it but i don't know where that is either oops i just uh shared our
[450.82 --> 456.92]  chat history on the stream because i went to send you a message and it still captured that window hopefully
[456.92 --> 463.10]  we haven't been talking about anything incriminating lately because that's out there um all butts oh
[463.10 --> 469.66]  it's all butts i mean that's that's pretty much a given uh let's just see uh uh yeah everything looks
[469.66 --> 476.04]  pretty good other than that uh tool that you shared with me that we probably don't need the entire
[476.04 --> 485.66]  internet having access to um what about the the stream key was that shared no okay cool no we're good
[485.66 --> 489.96]  no we're good we're good we're good all right you didn't send me the stream key in there no no it's
[489.96 --> 496.18]  all good yeah it's only 15 bucks i found it for 15 bucks us so that's like 30 canadian dollars now by
[496.18 --> 500.80]  the time you actually get it shipped up here but that's doable one thing you should make sure of
[500.80 --> 505.70]  though before you even do before you even spend 15 on that thing is make sure that it's got a clean
[505.70 --> 511.56]  hdmi output because i really struggled with that it does okay i've streamed with this before it looks
[511.56 --> 518.28]  really good i like this i have yeah all right i've used this before uh all right i mean i'm i'm hardly
[518.28 --> 524.46]  a streaming expert to be very clear like i shouldn't be the one advising you in fact uh epos vox watched
[524.46 --> 531.24]  my streaming setup upgrade video and basically tweeted at me he's like we should talk you should yeah why
[531.24 --> 535.76]  didn't you talk to him first i'm sure he would have been down no no i think i know what he was upset
[535.76 --> 542.26]  about and the thing he was upset about was a total like accident um so i was using this like super cheap
[542.26 --> 551.10]  behringer uh xlr interface on it and basically it was like a 30 interface on like a 500 microphone
[551.10 --> 558.18]  and a total mismatch everything else about it i think is is pretty fine like i'm using those elgato
[558.18 --> 566.32]  lights and like an elgato arm and i've got a um a rebel t6i camera that honestly i think looks pretty
[566.32 --> 572.74]  darn good now um and then i've got like a stream deck and it's all pretty standard stuff except for
[572.74 --> 578.32]  that interface that i was using that was just a total mismatch but my intention was to swap it out
[578.32 --> 584.88]  basically immediately for a go xlr because i really like being able to say words like and on stream
[584.88 --> 593.50]  so yes don't worry it's all good it's all good it's all bleep i was like oh no yeah no no no it's
[593.50 --> 602.66]  fine it's fine uh that is the biggest reason that i like it so um anyway i have swapped that out i
[602.66 --> 610.66]  actually recorded a video clip today explaining that it has been swapped out um so hopefully hopefully
[610.66 --> 614.24]  it's all hopefully it's all good um
[614.24 --> 622.28]  oh okay hold on a second um
[622.28 --> 623.96]  um
[623.96 --> 627.00]  oh never mind
[627.00 --> 632.12]  okay let's move on to our uh let's move on to our first topic then shall we
[632.12 --> 637.02]  should we go with the uh the 5g towers
[637.02 --> 641.72]  uh sure you're gonna have to solo this one a little bit because i have to do something
[641.72 --> 646.66]  very quickly yeah that makes sense but you would have to do such a thing so i'm gonna go ahead and
[646.66 --> 651.14]  actually you know what i'm gonna do a more boring topic first then apple and google team up to use
[651.14 --> 660.18]  your data against the against uh covid19 so this was posted by phil 104 on the forum and the original
[660.18 --> 665.44]  article here is from the bbc so apple and google are jointly developing technology to alert people
[665.44 --> 669.86]  if they have recently come into contact with others found to be infected with coronavirus this
[669.86 --> 676.80]  is some incredibly big brother stuff right there they hope to initially help third-party contact
[676.80 --> 682.34]  tracing apps run efficiently so this would make the apps interoperable so that contact tracing would
[682.34 --> 687.06]  continue to work if people traveled overseas and came into contact with people who are using a
[687.06 --> 692.42]  different tool ultimately they aim to do away with the need to download dedicated apps though
[692.42 --> 700.88]  baking a toggle switch into the os isn't that kind of terrifying like how how easy it is for them to
[700.88 --> 708.52]  turn on an app that basically catalogs everyone you've come in contact with like that took weeks
[708.52 --> 715.68]  yeah um yeah the two companies believe that their approach designed to keep users whose participation
[715.68 --> 722.30]  would be voluntary apparently okay so that's good i guess uh anonymous would um help address privacy
[722.30 --> 727.96]  concerns about this so so here here's how all that shakes down participation is voluntary you don't have to
[727.96 --> 735.16]  participate users are anonymous somehow i mean there's a so they're anonymous in the sense that i guess
[735.16 --> 742.72]  your your like user token would be um like uh like like randomized like it wouldn't be your name
[742.72 --> 750.18]  um but it wouldn't be anonymous in the sense that you couldn't like okay if i worked at google or apple
[750.18 --> 756.18]  and i was to have your token number and i could see everyone you've come in contact with i could
[756.18 --> 761.82]  probably figure out who you are eventually by going to places that you go on a regular basis and being
[761.82 --> 769.04]  like sup what's your name cool and then leaving and then i would be able to match a token with the name
[769.04 --> 774.84]  now obviously that's a pretty that's a lot of tinfoil hat kind of thing and it and that means that the database
[774.84 --> 780.46]  wouldn't be searchable the other way like i couldn't just enter a name and then see where that person is gone i would
[780.46 --> 786.68]  have to like find random tokens and then match those to names so it would you know be a one in seven billion
[786.68 --> 793.36]  shot to you know have kim kardashians you know who she's been in contact with token you know what i mean
[793.36 --> 799.18]  um but it's still i don't know there's definitely a lot of people out there that's going to make pretty
[799.18 --> 804.04]  uncomfortable so the way it tracks your location is it uses your phone's uh bluetooth signals to
[804.04 --> 808.68]  determine who the owner has recently been in proximity with for long enough to establish a
[808.68 --> 815.40]  contagion risk bluetooth that's actually a super kind of clever way to do it so it's not gps because
[815.40 --> 820.34]  as soon as you go inside a tall building or whatever you know gps isn't going to be accurate to within the
[820.34 --> 826.10]  six feet um that you're expected to maintain from other people for social distancing it would it would
[826.10 --> 831.90]  be far less accurate than that but if you're using bluetooth it can use gps as like a sanity check i
[831.90 --> 836.52]  mean i'm guessing i'm guessing it would do this but it could use gps as a sanity check to go okay yeah
[836.52 --> 841.50]  these guys were in approximately the same location and then bluetooth to be like oh yeah they actually
[841.50 --> 846.64]  were near each other i guess you wouldn't even need the gps that's pretty that's pretty cool that's
[846.64 --> 851.16]  kind of smart um close proximity so then you wouldn't know where people are going you would
[851.16 --> 857.16]  just know who they've been in proximity to okay that actually that does help my privacy concerns a
[857.16 --> 863.08]  little bit look it's got its own issues luke i see your face i see the face you're making i'm not saying
[863.08 --> 868.54]  it's perfect i'm not saying that's amazing and i i feel like you know we should just turn it on all the
[868.54 --> 874.38]  time i'm just saying it's better than having gps tracking on all the time it's definitely it's
[874.38 --> 883.72]  definitely an interesting tool in this time you f***ing dick whoa oh that's i don't hear the beeps
[883.72 --> 892.58]  there's just so much inside of me he's like you can't say that on the internet oh my goodness
[892.58 --> 894.88]  oh
[894.88 --> 900.30]  oh you missed one of them i guess but that one's not that big of a deal
[900.30 --> 908.44]  uh okay anyway so yeah okay tell me tell me how you feel tell me how you feel i i don't
[908.44 --> 917.84]  know i these things are always funky because there's always the like um i mean it's opt-in right
[917.84 --> 924.54]  yes so whatever but there's been a lot of things that have been opt-in that that turns out they're
[924.54 --> 932.78]  just like you can't yeah even if you don't opt in you can't opt out so yeah google likes doing that
[932.78 --> 938.92]  kind of stuff i i don't know um i mean
[938.92 --> 947.40]  i think i i usually like going with the like no protect my information thing in this case
[947.40 --> 955.64]  i would probably sign up for it um that's due to like people that i'm close with being high risk
[955.64 --> 960.26]  and wanting to protect them as much as possible and if i was able to know that i was near someone
[960.26 --> 966.60]  that was infected so that i could uh not be near those people anymore i think that would be very
[966.60 --> 973.56]  highly valuable so i would probably turn it on myself um you know what's interesting is we actually
[973.56 --> 981.02]  talked about a very similar topic and you said the pipes thing the uh no the smart toilets one
[981.02 --> 988.64]  i'm saying the yeah oh the the adult swim meme is that it's pipes oh sure okay uh smart pipe
[988.64 --> 995.24]  yeah so so smart toilets that would basically um evaluate your health based on your your ex
[995.24 --> 1001.44]  your excretions um and you said no for that one and i i think i had said something like so you
[1001.44 --> 1005.46]  wouldn't turn it on to save your life but then i guess the question becomes would you turn it on
[1005.46 --> 1011.16]  to save your dad's life yeah it's not mine oof i think i think that's like a big part of the change
[1011.16 --> 1022.78]  right um is that like that's me putting the value of my own information over the potential lives of
[1022.78 --> 1027.38]  the people that are close to me and that starts to break lines for me because that's no longer
[1027.38 --> 1035.68]  the consequence isn't on me anymore right or not as much yeah i mean it could be oh it is yeah yeah
[1035.68 --> 1041.06]  yeah yeah it still definitely is but anyone could die also other heavy consequence on other people
[1041.06 --> 1049.00]  you know yeah so i think that changes my stance on okay so tell me this then because really the the
[1049.00 --> 1056.72]  sort of the utopia you know outcome of the the smart toilet thing is that collectively as a species
[1056.72 --> 1064.54]  we become healthier and live longer because we learn far more about the effects of our our diet and
[1064.54 --> 1071.10]  our activities uh on the human body and we're all able to collectively be healthier now now but it gets
[1071.10 --> 1077.12]  more specific than that because let's say that some of the information that they collected about what puts
[1077.12 --> 1084.24]  what's higher risk for you like what you're at risk of let's say that knowledge could be used to say
[1084.24 --> 1092.08]  okay so there's a hereditary uh risk factor for luke here it came from somewhere and that ultimately
[1092.08 --> 1098.68]  comes back to someone like your parents or your brother and they could use that to proactively even
[1098.68 --> 1103.32]  though they don't have a smart toilet they could know oh wow well this guy got it from somewhere now
[1103.32 --> 1110.06]  what i think in this case i know that the person slash people that are at risk would much rather
[1110.06 --> 1120.00]  that i had the app installed um it's it's not that i can yes yeah okay i am i i wouldn't even have to
[1120.00 --> 1127.10]  ask they would they would very heavily insist that that was done right um so if the toilet thing came
[1127.10 --> 1132.24]  around and my my like family and people that are close to me were like hey you should get this thing
[1132.24 --> 1137.96]  because of me i would be like i would i think i would be much more heavily convinced if that makes
[1137.96 --> 1141.76]  sense right but as long as they don't watch wanshow and they don't learn about this toilet then you're
[1141.76 --> 1146.52]  never gonna bring it up then we're good all right all right all right all right got it got it i it's
[1146.52 --> 1153.86]  it's it's i think it's it's one thing to be proactive on your own and it's another thing to deny
[1153.86 --> 1161.22]  someone else's concerns if that makes sense all right so my current stance on that it uses the
[1161.22 --> 1167.94]  bluetooth signals that um so it uses the bluetooth signals all right it's officially the boomer show
[1167.94 --> 1172.08]  now it uses bluetooth signals to determine who you've been in proximity with and if one of those
[1172.08 --> 1179.78]  people later test positive for covid19 um the owner of the handset that's gone near it would get a
[1179.78 --> 1185.70]  warning okay so this is right in here no gps location data or personal information would be
[1185.70 --> 1189.98]  recorded and the records of the digital ids involved would be stored on remote servers but the
[1189.98 --> 1195.68]  companies say these could not be used to unmask a specific individual's true identity i'd be
[1195.68 --> 1202.50]  interested in what the warning uh is or would be because for instance there there's a there's a
[1202.50 --> 1211.80]  concern that's affecting us right now um i won't entirely go into it but uh a bus driver in british
[1211.80 --> 1218.54]  columbia that worked in in i think i think it was the surrey area but they won't specify what route
[1218.54 --> 1224.46]  um contracted covid and died but they won't but they won't tell anyone what route
[1224.46 --> 1230.44]  yeah that seems counterproductive seems counterproductive but apparently it's because
[1230.44 --> 1236.76]  they're worried about like witch hunting on his like family and other stuff like that because there's
[1236.76 --> 1241.44]  been a lot of negative reactions like people attacking nurse nurses and doctors and stuff like
[1241.44 --> 1247.46]  that uh i haven't heard about this this is a new one for me that's i don't know how common that is in
[1247.46 --> 1254.38]  canada um but i've like yeah i've seen i've seen video stuff of it online i think the big concern and
[1254.38 --> 1259.36]  the reason why people are doing that is due to them still wearing their scrubs and their medical
[1259.36 --> 1266.02]  stuff on the way home and they're worried about them spreading it oh i see but i don't know i mean
[1266.02 --> 1271.48]  this whole thing is very weird right now probably should be ditching that stuff at the hospital and
[1271.48 --> 1277.38]  leaving it there to be cleaned um that's yeah that's a fair point but i also you know they might
[1277.38 --> 1281.30]  not have the facilities for that right now or something because it might be over capacity i don't
[1281.30 --> 1288.94]  know all right um but yeah they won't release like what the route was which seems i don't know i'm not
[1288.94 --> 1295.02]  a fan of that personally but all right apparently so like so basically what i guess i would say is like
[1295.02 --> 1302.16]  would they say where or just you have been near someone no no i don't think it would even know
[1302.16 --> 1309.32]  where so the contact matching process takes place yes on device uh rather than centrally so it would
[1309.32 --> 1317.48]  be nice if you if it told you the time then yeah the time would be pretty nice um but i think because
[1317.48 --> 1323.12]  there's a difference between like if you're somewhere and you're being extremely careful
[1323.12 --> 1328.94]  versus yours and so like you you probably didn't get it even though there was someone within bluetooth
[1328.94 --> 1334.84]  range yeah or there's somewhere where you your defenses have to come down a certain degree for
[1334.84 --> 1339.18]  a certain amount of time and if you knew that was happening someone just said luke interrupting tips
[1339.18 --> 1344.02]  yeah i'm sorry um if you knew that was happening it would be nice to know like oh i was somewhat
[1344.02 --> 1349.54]  compromised at that time that's fair my concern level goes up but i think the issue is that they
[1349.54 --> 1357.54]  want to take as little information as possible to to get you sort of the the basic they want to take
[1357.54 --> 1362.62]  as little info as possible to get you something actionable and the actionable thing is hey you need
[1362.62 --> 1367.36]  to go into quarantine yeah that's it yeah yeah that's all there is to it you were exposed that's fair
[1367.36 --> 1374.46]  get into quarantine because it's so contagious that if you were in a close proximity to someone
[1374.46 --> 1379.70]  who has it for some period of time that apparently it does require you to be in contact for some
[1379.70 --> 1383.86]  period of time so it's not enough to drive past someone on the street is what i'm assuming they're
[1383.86 --> 1389.24]  trying to avoid um then you just you just kind of need to because it can be it can stay alive on
[1389.24 --> 1396.20]  surfaces uh people can can cough into the air and the the particles can be inhaled um so it actually
[1396.20 --> 1399.90]  seems like i started out really skeptical about this but it seems like the way that they're going
[1399.90 --> 1405.98]  about it is kind of smart and pretty reasonable so they're saying they will openly publish information
[1405.98 --> 1410.56]  about their work for others to analyze and the european union's data protection supervisor said the
[1410.56 --> 1414.66]  initiative will require further assessment however after a quick look it seems to tick the right boxes
[1414.66 --> 1420.54]  as as it pertains to user choice data protection by design and pan-european interoperability
[1420.54 --> 1428.52]  all right well uh good good luck um in other news this is will you sign up for it will i sign up for
[1428.52 --> 1434.26]  it sure yeah yeah i don't see why not i mean right now i i basically haven't left my house other than
[1434.26 --> 1439.72]  to run to my local grocery store grab a couple things wipe down the boxes with lysol wipes when i get
[1439.72 --> 1445.78]  back to my house and that's it that's basically all i've done in the last like two and a half weeks
[1445.78 --> 1451.52]  so if i'm in quarantine i don't think i'm going to bother to put the app on my phone but if i were to
[1451.52 --> 1459.10]  go back to the office like i i've been i had coughed twice today um so i'll have been symptom free for 72
[1459.10 --> 1464.34]  hours by sometime next week and i would like to go back to the office so that i'm not setting up every
[1464.34 --> 1470.06]  shoot by myself right now like i or like i am right now um and so if i were to do that yeah i think it
[1470.06 --> 1474.70]  would make sense for me to have an app installed at the very least and i'll probably switch to wearing
[1474.70 --> 1479.56]  masks except when i'm like the moments that i'm on camera and recording just because it muffles the
[1479.56 --> 1490.46]  audio yeah yeah in other news uh phil 104 on the forum posted this this is great um some people believe
[1490.46 --> 1500.18]  that 5g like like for cell phones um started covid and those people need uh need an education because
[1500.18 --> 1509.08]  that's really not how viruses work um but 5g towers have apparently been set fire to in birmingham are
[1509.08 --> 1515.10]  you are you trying to tell me you can't send viruses over a network uh okay well i think i think you're
[1515.10 --> 1522.98]  intentionally trying to misunderstand me sir sir sir i'm gonna have to ask it sir okay sir sir now that's
[1522.98 --> 1529.64]  now sir that kind of tone is just simply not acceptable sir uh you're you're definitely
[1529.64 --> 1536.34]  misunderstanding me on purpose um i'm saying that no no waves through the air cannot uh cause a virus
[1536.34 --> 1544.10]  to infect human cells there that kind of virus there's my third cough for the day yeah you you
[1544.10 --> 1549.52]  basically you basically made me sick by pretending to be that stupid that's what happened right there
[1549.52 --> 1555.50]  um gave you a gave you a virus 5g towers have been set fire to in birmingham liverpool and
[1555.50 --> 1562.82]  melling and cabinet office minister michael gove said it is just nonsense dangerous nonsense as well
[1562.82 --> 1569.48]  because people seem to be setting fire to these 5g towers in order to stop the spread of covid
[1569.48 --> 1577.94]  now i do appreciate people trying to help you know that's good taking the initiative is good and uh
[1577.94 --> 1583.30]  you know working together as a society to make ourselves all safer and healthier that's good too
[1583.30 --> 1592.86]  um but but diseases are not caused by 5g and uh setting cell phone towers on fire during a
[1592.86 --> 1600.10]  an emergency a heightened heightened level of emergency state which we're in is especially stupid
[1600.10 --> 1607.88]  because they're needed um for people to call emergency services so we we really do need
[1607.88 --> 1614.20]  um cell phone towers working and not on fire so if there's anyone in our audience which i don't
[1614.20 --> 1619.02]  believe to be the case i i actually do like to think that our audience is a bit of a cut above the
[1619.02 --> 1625.42]  average um youtube viewer if there's anyone in our audience who is out there part of a vigilante group
[1625.42 --> 1631.60]  that is um you know taking it to those those corporations that are infecting us with covid with
[1631.60 --> 1638.00]  the 5g towers i would like to ask you to stop please to please end it now yeah to please stop
[1638.00 --> 1643.82]  setting fire to the towers because we do in fact need the towers thank you very much good run yeah
[1643.82 --> 1649.30]  you know what i'm not gonna ask you to yeah i'm not gonna ask you to demask yourself and admit that
[1649.30 --> 1654.06]  you were involved because if i was you i wouldn't want to admit i was involved in something that
[1654.06 --> 1659.52]  ridiculously down either so that's fine don't say anything but just please stop setting fire to the
[1659.52 --> 1665.88]  towers and thank you and if you if you can if you can if if those people are reachable you know like
[1665.88 --> 1669.92]  some people are not reachable i don't know if you saw that clip of the lady who is covered in jesus's
[1669.92 --> 1675.74]  blood did you happen to see that one yeah yeah yeah i saw i saw that too um some people are not
[1675.74 --> 1682.66]  reachable so if if you're if your compatriots are are just not reachable you know i don't expect you
[1682.66 --> 1689.58]  to convert them to to not believing that 5g causes covid because there's just you know there's nothing
[1689.58 --> 1694.90]  you can do at a certain point but just don't be involved in it you know and maybe don't talk to
[1694.90 --> 1700.72]  them anymore because they're probably you know not the kind of people that make you a better person
[1700.72 --> 1706.18]  that's all i'm saying yeah that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying all right david shook says
[1706.18 --> 1713.40]  my ancestors burned witches all right that's fair that's fair that is actually fairly that's a good
[1713.40 --> 1721.20]  parallel um humans evolve and grow past things actually i think this topic is basically all
[1721.20 --> 1725.94]  the evidence we need that they don't well i think this is now a smaller
[1725.94 --> 1732.24]  you can't touch me because of covid so i think we're okay
[1732.24 --> 1739.74]  yeah it's gonna be hard to get people to uh burn me at the stake if no one is gonna come near me
[1739.74 --> 1743.02]  yeah all right cool solved
[1743.02 --> 1753.40]  xa says no one really believes 5g causes coronavirus are you sure but people are concerned
[1753.40 --> 1759.70]  with 5g safety and uh privacy consequences oh and the the message is gone now yeah uh you still
[1759.70 --> 1765.14]  shouldn't be lighting the things on fire that's definitely definitely the wrong super duper wrong
[1765.14 --> 1772.80]  approach also i think there's a lot of confusion about what exactly 5g is because many people and i
[1772.80 --> 1777.36]  saw this in the comments on those both of the videos actually in spite of the fact that explicitly
[1777.36 --> 1784.54]  in both videos i explained this um 5g is not the same as millimeter wave there seems to be a ton
[1784.54 --> 1789.16]  of confusion in the comments on those videos across the internet in general where people are like
[1789.16 --> 1797.60]  5g is dangerous because of the high frequency of the waves or because of the high speeds it operates
[1797.60 --> 1805.00]  at or whatever whatever whatever whatever 5g is not the same as millimeter wave and millimeter wave
[1805.00 --> 1810.86]  which we also demonstrated in both videos is so pinner that it can't even get through a piece of
[1810.86 --> 1818.92]  paper let alone penetrating your body and mutating your cells so 5g millimeter wave is definitely okay
[1818.92 --> 1825.36]  superhero though is definitely okay to be a superhero enough enough enough so to support enough okay so
[1825.36 --> 1833.72]  5g millimeter wave is is 5g just wi-fi no no no no rob no it's not wi-fi okay 5g is just the fifth
[1833.72 --> 1840.36]  generation of cellular technology that's all it is it operates across stands for it operate it operate yes
[1840.36 --> 1846.76]  the g is for generation it operates across multiple not not just multiple it operates across the spectrum
[1846.76 --> 1855.36]  okay so you can have 5g that's based on low band so that's your long range low speed waves okay you can
[1855.36 --> 1861.10]  have 5g across your mid band so that's your medium speed medium range and then you can have 5g on your
[1861.10 --> 1869.64]  high band waves so those are your high frequency high speed but low range waves okay so there's a
[1869.64 --> 1875.84]  bunch of technology built into 5g around the way the signals are processed that it makes it fifth
[1875.84 --> 1884.58]  generation is it fairly iterative actually in some ways yes and 4g long-term evolution 4g lte i think
[1884.58 --> 1887.98]  some of the marketing around that was like this is going to be the last one and then now they're
[1887.98 --> 1893.40]  turning around and they're going no no 5g 5g now and so i think there's a lot of people upset about
[1893.40 --> 1899.24]  the way that 5g has been marketed but that doesn't change what it is what it is is another evolutionary
[1899.24 --> 1906.74]  step forward in the handling of wireless signals over cellular networks that's all it is now if you
[1906.74 --> 1912.28]  want to talk about millimeter wave we can talk about millimeter wave but that's a separate conversation
[1912.28 --> 1920.70]  that's it yeah yeah pretty much not something to light fire to you
[1920.70 --> 1926.84]  storybook bus 03 says you're giving a very cut version of the scientific explanation
[1926.84 --> 1931.62]  well yeah yeah this is a this is a tech podcast what do you what do you want from me if you want
[1931.62 --> 1935.72]  to explain something you better do so with full displays and all information without bias what bias
[1935.72 --> 1941.78]  waves traveling through the air don't care about your bias that's it the the they don't they don't
[1941.78 --> 1946.78]  go through stuff that's all there is to it it's if you want full featured full fat scientific
[1946.78 --> 1954.96]  explanations go look them up um leo key says 5g towers are radioactive so is the the glowing banana so
[1954.96 --> 1961.10]  yeah so is the banana the ocean so is the glowing uh face on your watch and you wear that on your wrist
[1961.10 --> 1968.22]  and yet somehow we don't have uh you know a rash of wrist tumors just because something is radioactive
[1968.22 --> 1976.62]  actually doesn't inherently make it going to kill you like ah come on guys please please please okay
[1976.62 --> 1981.88]  all right well you know what let's just let's just let's just talk about sponsors that'll make me feel
[1981.88 --> 1990.10]  better top seven radioactive items in your home brazil nuts bananas your own body smoke detectors granite
[1990.10 --> 1993.26]  countertops your grandma's dinnerware and cigarettes
[1993.26 --> 2001.68]  that's great i like that there's a list for that this video today is brought to you by displate oh
[2001.68 --> 2006.66]  wait you know what no let's summarize let's summarize first please don't light cell phone towers on fire
[2006.66 --> 2013.08]  thank you very much all right this video is brought to you by displate uh displate is a magnet mounted
[2013.08 --> 2018.44]  metal print that's durable and doesn't require any tools to hang it they've got over 800 000 different
[2018.44 --> 2022.98]  art spanning a bunch of different styles and influences with their easy magnetic mounting
[2022.98 --> 2027.98]  uh there's no holes in your wall and it's easily replaceable and really quick to make adjustments like
[2027.98 --> 2033.08]  if it's not quite level they plant a tree for every displate purchased and we even have our own line of
[2033.08 --> 2039.16]  displates at displate.com slash linus tech tips slash portraits just head to the link below and use code
[2039.16 --> 2045.60]  ltt to save 15 on displate today i see you highlighting that link but i don't see you screen sharing can i can i see it
[2045.60 --> 2053.34]  it it's coming yes there it is look at him go oh hey there's a wan show one now that's pretty sick
[2053.34 --> 2059.16]  wait was that always there well whatever it's definitely uh yeah it's that loop guy wearing his
[2059.16 --> 2065.60]  team liquid uh sweater yeah in pixel art and now he's what is he doing now oh yeah there we go there
[2065.60 --> 2071.06]  we go there it is look at that i thought we had a different one is this the one one i thought there
[2071.06 --> 2074.78]  was a different one one too apparently this is the one one now whatever i like this one better it's
[2074.78 --> 2082.36]  that og that og uh edsel iago pixel art right there that's an original edsel iago right there
[2082.36 --> 2088.58]  yeah i'm pretty yeah i'm pretty sure he did all that stuff yeah yeah yeah i collect edsel iago's and
[2088.58 --> 2092.20]  yes he definitely did this that's old stuff yeah well i was just seeing if there's maybe some new
[2092.20 --> 2097.48]  assets mixed in but no those are all those are all ancient like six year old seven year old
[2097.48 --> 2103.76]  assets for sure uh the show is also brought show is also brought to you today by private internet
[2103.76 --> 2110.00]  access are you a filthy pirate or do you just want to you know keep your isp from seeing what
[2110.00 --> 2113.72]  you're looking at even though they're not going to send you a letter in the mail about it well
[2113.72 --> 2121.56]  whatever get pia pia internet access get private internet access um adding a vpn lets you mask your ip
[2121.56 --> 2126.76]  and encrypt traffic to and from your devices and it's an important piece of your online security toolkit

[2131.44 --> 2135.08]  configurable encryption and an internet kill switch to keep you in control of your connection
[2135.08 --> 2142.76]  and when combined with private browsing i a vpn can make can even make websites oh yeah can make
[2142.76 --> 2145.72]  websites think you're in a different country what do you mean even make websites that's like half the
[2145.72 --> 2150.50]  point it's getting like cheaper cheaper airfare and stuff i mean not right now mind you apparently
[2150.50 --> 2155.26]  flights are down about like 80 or something stupid like that try it risk-free with their 30-day money

[2228.72 --> 2237.16]  oh yeah hey look at that he's back ladies and gentlemen hey what else we got to talk about
[2237.16 --> 2242.00]  today oh let's talk about the playstation 5 controller yes okay all right i have not seen
[2242.00 --> 2247.98]  bring it up bring it up so the original article is from the uh the playstation blog okay and it was
[2247.98 --> 2256.08]  posted by soft 006 on the forum sony has released images of the final design of the dual sense controller
[2256.08 --> 2263.62]  dual sense i can't find it there it is dual sense dual so what's dual about it other than the
[2263.62 --> 2274.84]  like what's dual whoa whoa whoa indeed bruh whoa let me get this on screen yeah it looks like it has
[2274.84 --> 2281.16]  like it looks like it's wearing like a super suit like it looks it looks like an older playstation
[2281.16 --> 2287.18]  controller that like put on like a skin tight suit okay can i stop you for one second here chat is
[2287.18 --> 2296.44]  still arguing about 5g oh anyway go ahead so people were wondering if people were concerned about 5g
[2296.44 --> 2306.50]  there's your answer um it looks interesting it doesn't look crazy different i would say this is the
[2306.50 --> 2312.20]  i'm okay i mean this is a fairly station doesn't change much so given playstation's controller changes
[2312.20 --> 2319.48]  maybe i think this is pretty dramatic for a playstation controller change sure because like
[2319.48 --> 2326.34]  look at like my biggest issue with playstation controllers um is not actually like it is a
[2326.34 --> 2333.38]  problem for me but my biggest issue is not actually the fact that the joysticks are um not not um
[2333.38 --> 2340.30]  oh the the joystick and d-pad on the left side i like them swapped like the uh xbox controller yeah
[2340.30 --> 2346.36]  so they're it's symmetrical that's that's my that's one of my big issues with it but my bigger issue was
[2346.36 --> 2352.92]  that i just don't find the like the like knobbly handles i don't find them very ergonomic they're not
[2352.92 --> 2359.70]  contoured to my hand like what hand is that designed for where are you saying where the the the
[2359.70 --> 2365.84]  joystick has a dimple kind of no no the the backs like the handles oh yeah like on the older ones
[2365.84 --> 2371.24]  this new one looks way more ergonomic to me so i just looked up a picture of a playstation 4 controller
[2371.24 --> 2378.46]  yeah and yeah i think i think i saw the new ones handles and we're just like yeah that's obviously
[2378.46 --> 2388.06]  how that should work but yeah the previous one has like rounded sticks yeah like it just it it never
[2388.06 --> 2393.86]  made sense to me whose hand were those designed for like it's it looks like a game controller it
[2393.86 --> 2399.84]  doesn't look like something that fits in a human appendage you know what i mean yeah i know i've i've
[2399.84 --> 2405.96]  never personally liked playstation controllers i even um when i started trying to play horizon zero dawn
[2405.96 --> 2414.82]  on a ps4 i went out and figured out how to like usb adapter and program in an xbox controller to be
[2414.82 --> 2421.02]  all the play on the playstation and it was worth it in my opinion yeah i just i i've spent so much
[2421.02 --> 2427.98]  time on controllers with offset joysticks instead of inline joysticks it feels really weird to have
[2427.98 --> 2432.92]  my hand held like that i have relatively big hands i know other people that have relatively big hands
[2432.92 --> 2439.68]  and like playstation controllers but it feels it feels uh too cramped for me everything's in and i have
[2439.68 --> 2444.84]  to bring my thumbs in i just i don't like it this looks a lot better to hold it like that basically
[2444.84 --> 2452.76]  like i still don't i i still don't prefer the inline joysticks but the the ergonomics of the
[2452.76 --> 2458.58]  backing of it like this is the biggest change for sure since going to dual analog sticks on the
[2458.58 --> 2465.74]  playstation 2 it's been pretty pretty iterative since there okay a little touch panel here a little
[2465.74 --> 2470.74]  you know light there and you share button or whatever whatever that button was called uh yeah
[2470.74 --> 2480.48]  very much like the the design idea of the playstation 4 one is like kind of fixed shapes like the d-pad
[2480.48 --> 2487.74]  even though it's a d-pad it has this ring on it and the ring is kind of the same size as the one for
[2487.74 --> 2495.36]  x circle square triangle um and then the joysticks both have their own little rings then everything else is
[2495.36 --> 2500.32]  like there's two sticks shoved on the side and the touch pad is a block yeah and this new one is much
[2500.32 --> 2507.68]  more sweeping yeah like it's curved like for like for humans like for soft things to touch it yeah i'm
[2507.68 --> 2515.34]  i'm actually i'm surprisingly into it you know every once in a while this happens on uh on tech linked
[2515.34 --> 2521.80]  where i'm reading a news story and i haven't actually seen the thing i'm talking about um so i think
[2521.80 --> 2527.64]  i made fun of the ps5 controller on tech linked when i shot it on wednesday this week but but looking
[2527.64 --> 2533.12]  at this like yeah cool looking at this i'm like ah you know what i don't know i don't know riley i think
[2533.12 --> 2540.34]  i think it looks pretty good i mean yeah there's still things i would change for sure but this is the
[2540.34 --> 2546.52]  kind of improvement that could make me not immediately discard a playstation controller and go look for an
[2546.52 --> 2552.48]  xbox one um i'm still not i wouldn't buy one like if i wanted a controller for my pc like some which is
[2552.48 --> 2557.90]  all i really use a controller on i don't actually own a console um well i do i have a switch but if i
[2557.90 --> 2563.78]  wanted to to to just use a controller on my pc i would still go get an xbox controller uh instead of
[2563.78 --> 2569.84]  this if i had to buy it but if if someone handed me this i wouldn't be like ew oh gross ew and and not
[2569.84 --> 2576.12]  use it this is this is looks a lot better some interesting features uh they've adopted haptic
[2576.12 --> 2583.52]  feedback so you'll feel quote the slow grittiness of driving a car through mud uh adaptive triggers
[2583.52 --> 2590.44]  for l2 and r2 so you can feel the tension of your actions like when uh drawing a bow to shoot an arrow
[2590.44 --> 2596.74]  that's actually pretty cool um okay change the angle of the triggers made some subtle updates to
[2596.74 --> 2601.54]  the grip that doesn't look subtle to me at all it looks way better i think they mean like the
[2601.54 --> 2606.62]  texture oh okay like the actual grip of it not the shape or anything i don't know because that looks
[2606.62 --> 2611.26]  that looks like an extreme update to the grip and like in a good way maybe they call it a subtle update
[2611.26 --> 2616.02]  so that they don't have to acknowledge how bad it was before like maybe someone came in and was like
[2616.02 --> 2621.42]  you know we got some fresh blood in or something or like you know maybe one of the executives that's
[2621.42 --> 2626.64]  just you know all business and no gaming you know has a kid now that like grew up and is like
[2626.64 --> 2632.26]  you know 22 and started at the company and there's like a bunch of nepotism and this this kid you know
[2632.26 --> 2636.42]  has way more say all of a sudden than any of the other people that actually know anything about
[2636.42 --> 2641.34]  gaming and came in and was like yo we've been doing this wrong for like 25 years can we please
[2641.34 --> 2647.00]  finally fix this and they're like oh oh yeah okay yeah sure no problem no problem sir we got this
[2647.00 --> 2651.80]  and and this is totally hypothetical i don't think that's actually how it went down but it just seems
[2651.80 --> 2656.12]  like why did they not fix it for so long and then now it's just like immediately yeah subtle changes
[2656.12 --> 2660.38]  way better i haven't actually held it in my hands yet so i don't know that it's that much better but
[2660.38 --> 2665.84]  it looks that much better it does look a lot better we'll have to see till yeah hands-on with controllers
[2665.84 --> 2673.14]  is so important but well it looks better there's also a built-in mic in the controller so that's probably
[2673.14 --> 2680.66]  horrible um it might be all right like microphone i just mean because i usually
[2680.66 --> 2689.90]  honestly don't want to hear anybody okay but that's a separate conversation yeah i jumped into
[2689.90 --> 2694.68]  some vr game at one point that i didn't realize was going to drop me straight into a multiplayer arena
[2694.68 --> 2700.36]  like i was doing the tutorial which it turns out takes place in a multiplayer accessible space
[2700.36 --> 2706.62]  that's pretty and your mic is automatically just on and open when you launch this game i forget what
[2706.62 --> 2712.30]  game it was it was horrible it made me nauseated almost immediately and um anyway just the amount
[2712.30 --> 2717.20]  of just other people shrieking and i couldn't figure out like why they were yelling at me or even what
[2717.20 --> 2722.20]  they were saying because it just sounded like nothing because it was just clipping uh and super high
[2722.20 --> 2728.66]  pitched you know how it is um anyway the quality of the mic might not necessarily be terrible sony
[2728.66 --> 2735.34]  does know a thing or two about audio and yeah oh yeah yeah good good array mics these days can be
[2735.34 --> 2741.30]  shockingly good like the mic i get so many comments about how uh good my vr streams sound
[2741.30 --> 2748.76]  using the built-in microphone on the valve index the index yeah the index's mic is is very surprising
[2748.76 --> 2755.78]  i will definitely agree with that shockingly god tier like i couldn't believe it yeah but i i yeah my
[2755.78 --> 2760.70]  biggest complaint with that is just the like barrier of entry for people being able to put their
[2760.70 --> 2765.62]  voice in your ears right it's nice for them to have to have money to transmit their voice to you
[2765.62 --> 2771.94]  as opposed to just owning a controller yeah which like came with the console right so like literally
[2771.94 --> 2776.30]  everyone will have access to that if you play with anyone on playstation they will have access
[2776.30 --> 2779.40]  to it unless it's backwards compatible with the ps4 controllers i guess
[2779.40 --> 2786.70]  but yeah i don't know looks cool excited to actually hold it in my hands i hope it's a step
[2786.70 --> 2791.18]  up uh because then if i ever have to play anything on playstation it won't immediately feel quite as
[2791.18 --> 2792.24]  horrible as it currently does
[2792.24 --> 2798.66]  i'm just not into those kind of controllers and the thing is like sometimes you might feel like you
[2798.66 --> 2802.14]  have to play something on playstation because there's like some good games over there they have
[2802.14 --> 2807.02]  a lot of really good exclusives you know what uh this is not a news topic for this week but i feel
[2807.02 --> 2812.58]  like i need to talk about it the number of comments like fanboys drive me absolutely crazy the number
[2812.58 --> 2817.96]  of comments on my review of the s20 ultra this week where the title was please don't buy the s20 ultra
[2817.96 --> 2825.34]  and the reason is that as far as i feel okay and this it's my opinion you watch my videos so you can get
[2825.34 --> 2832.28]  my opinion okay that's the way it works um it made no noticeable change to my life compared to my
[2832.28 --> 2836.88]  two-year-old note 9 that i'm still daily driving because i can't use the fold because this
[2836.88 --> 2842.26]  youtube stories feature is broken on it uh and i need that for work i know it's the stupidest thing
[2842.26 --> 2847.62]  ever i love the fold and it just it was working for a bit so i went back to using it and then it
[2847.62 --> 2851.58]  just stopped working again i tried a youtube app update today just to see if it's back it's not
[2851.58 --> 2854.74]  doesn't work sorry i know this is not it's just not there
[2854.74 --> 2862.98]  yeah i contacted samsung and like the rep that i talked to had no idea and then i contacted uh top
[2862.98 --> 2868.28]  creator support and they were like oh yeah it's not supported on that device i'm like why and then
[2868.28 --> 2872.84]  i don't know that i ever heard back i don't know that i actually sent an email saying why um because
[2872.84 --> 2877.14]  that would have been you should try um pretty obnoxious you should try just getting the apk
[2877.14 --> 2884.64]  no i tried it oh really yeah no it didn't work yeah it didn't work so really frustrating um and then
[2884.64 --> 2888.26]  i think one of the samsung people i talked to was like oh yeah it's working on my phone my fold i'm
[2888.26 --> 2892.46]  like oh that's nice but like i need it working on mine so that i can use this device and then
[2892.46 --> 2897.02]  i'm not sure that we ever found a resolution to that so anyway what i was trying to say was this
[2897.02 --> 2903.76]  is a 1400 us dollar phone that as far as i can tell does not justify its price in any meaningful way
[2903.76 --> 2909.68]  um something like the note 9 my justification for why i recommended it at the time in spite of the fact
[2909.68 --> 2915.86]  that it was i think it was 1100 for the top spec or 1200 for the top it was also a very expensive
[2915.86 --> 2923.48]  device but it had everything no other device ever has had everything the way the note 9 does
[2923.48 --> 2931.44]  it has a headphone jack it's got expandable storage it's got ip water resistance it's got a serviceable
[2931.44 --> 2937.92]  camera yes it's not as good as some newer phones now for sure but it's still better than like your
[2937.92 --> 2945.42]  your your typical chinese phone um or like a value phone so it just it had everything it had the
[2945.42 --> 2951.16]  stylus i don't use it that often but sometimes it really comes in handy it's really nice and it
[2951.16 --> 2955.92]  didn't have a a hole punch in the display it didn't have a notch it was just like i was like okay
[2955.92 --> 2963.16]  everything came together for this device it's worth paying a premium for and to me the s20 ultra just
[2963.16 --> 2973.70]  didn't do that at all it's it's it's another phone like okay neat neat i guess that's fair um i think
[2973.70 --> 2979.12]  we're we're starting to run into that more and more unless you have like drastic features like folding
[2979.12 --> 2984.44]  so anyway though but that's i mean that's exactly it is i'd also i also said i love the fold
[2984.44 --> 2990.04]  but anyway what was what was really funny to me about this though was the comments on that video
[2990.04 --> 2996.72]  particularly after the um like the first wave where it's our subscribers watching so once a
[2996.72 --> 3001.06]  video does well with our subscribers youtube will algorithmically start to serve it out to a broader
[3001.06 --> 3010.88]  audience right and it is full of people just sort of bashing on me for just being an iphone fanboy
[3010.88 --> 3018.94]  and i'm looking at this like what are you talking about justin says just say you're biased towards
[3018.94 --> 3027.46]  iphone man because we all already know this is two comments later dur csr says you are a fan of apple
[3027.46 --> 3034.28]  in all caps um hold on i gotta scroll a little bit further down to find another one i'm trying to
[3034.28 --> 3040.38]  figure out how and why someone would come to that conclusion because the only reason to say anything
[3040.38 --> 3048.28]  negative about a samsung phone is if you're a filthy apple fanboy because i didn't even i didn't even say
[3048.28 --> 3054.98]  you know the iphone is the greatest phone on earth in that video i just said that this phone is more
[3054.98 --> 3061.20]  expensive than an iphone and definitely falls short of it in certain ways like i don't think i don't
[3061.20 --> 3068.64]  think it justifies it that's all i said you're you're an iphone fan it's like a perfect way for me to
[3068.64 --> 3075.36]  filter through comments and determine who in fact does not watch this channel at all and yeah
[3075.36 --> 3081.84]  just phones in general are just way too expensive these days phones in general seem to be kind of the
[3081.84 --> 3089.08]  new amd versus intel from like a fanboy flame war perspective like i don't remember the lot even like
[3089.08 --> 3095.70]  xbox playstation i don't think maybe i just don't participate in that community as much but i don't think
[3095.70 --> 3101.66]  i've seen nearly the same level of toxicity in the last couple years i don't think the console
[3101.66 --> 3108.82]  fanboy wars have been very hot for a long time um that might be because it's been a long time since
[3108.82 --> 3113.78]  we've had a new one yeah when the new launch when the new launch happens we might see once people are
[3113.78 --> 3119.88]  actually making decisions with their money again um and like voting with their wallets and it's like
[3119.88 --> 3124.28]  you know like that south park uh episode the the i think it was like a lord of the rings spoof they did
[3124.28 --> 3127.78]  where they were deciding which consoles to buy and they like went to battle or something
[3127.78 --> 3132.60]  that was black friday thing whatever it doesn't matter the point is um you know once people are
[3132.60 --> 3136.44]  are getting into arguments with their friend group about like which one we should all invest in so we
[3136.44 --> 3141.50]  can all play together it might heat up a little bit but right now it feels like no one cares you just
[3141.50 --> 3146.32]  if you want to play especially when when like you want to play with your friends but your your like dad
[3146.32 --> 3150.24]  is going to buy one of them regardless because he probably wants to play with his friends or
[3150.24 --> 3155.40]  something yeah and like so you try to push your friends to get that one and then maybe another
[3155.40 --> 3161.02]  factor is just how prevalent crossplay is becoming outside of exclusive titles and first party titles
[3161.02 --> 3167.74]  it no longer matters that much like david and i can argue about you know xbox controller versus
[3167.74 --> 3173.92]  playstation controller he likes the playstation controller what a what a pleb i know what a noob what
[3173.92 --> 3177.80]  yeah exactly well i wouldn't call him a noob because he can pony pretty much
[3177.80 --> 3186.00]  beat both of us um he's a pretty good gamer uh anyway um but like we can argue about it without
[3186.00 --> 3191.64]  it really mattering and so maybe part of it too is that we're at the point now in this console's
[3191.64 --> 3198.84]  life cycle where buying both of them is not completely unattainable compared to when they both first
[3198.84 --> 3204.48]  launched you could probably buy both of these consoles used with an adequate amount of accessories
[3204.48 --> 3209.56]  compared to buying one of them back when they launched and the accessories that you need because
[3209.56 --> 3216.36]  accessories in particular are so much cheaper to get secondhand so so maybe it's not it's not as much
[3216.36 --> 3221.04]  of like a cost barrier plus you know if you're people like you and me you know what i always used
[3221.04 --> 3226.90]  to do was wait for something to be a little bit older i would buy it secondhand and then i would flip it
[3226.90 --> 3231.42]  six months later still secondhand basically losing nothing and in some cases being up on the deal
[3231.42 --> 3236.40]  so if you really want to play the exclusives one way or the other by now what are we like
[3236.40 --> 3240.96]  five or six years into this generation of consoles you could realistically have played through all the
[3240.96 --> 3245.92]  exclusives on both of them flip them and just be sitting on your money waiting to pick up the new
[3245.92 --> 3252.94]  one when it comes out yeah because like a lot of um a lot of games that are going to come out in the
[3252.94 --> 3257.30]  next little while will probably be on the next one anyways and if i remember correctly the
[3257.30 --> 3262.40]  the next one is going to be fully backwards compatible so if a game comes out in the interim
[3262.40 --> 3268.82]  you'll still be able to play it it doesn't doesn't really even matter that much okay okay mike says you
[3268.82 --> 3275.60]  said apple in the s20 ultra review i know i did but i didn't say that you know the iphone is god's gift
[3275.60 --> 3282.68]  to phone users i just made a comparison which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do in a review of a
[3282.68 --> 3289.46]  device that's all uh okay and this is a fair point jc says if you go on twitter you can easily find
[3289.46 --> 3294.96]  toxic console fanboys that's true but if you go on twitter you can easily find toxic anything yeah
[3294.96 --> 3301.86]  like i swear to you you could find you could find fans like toxic fanboys of particular types of
[3301.86 --> 3307.60]  mouse traps on twitter and they would be at each other's throats even though nobody else literally
[3307.60 --> 3316.54]  nobody else in the world cares at all yep uh what other topics we got for today teams grew a thousand
[3316.54 --> 3322.30]  percent in march that makes sense um ah yes amd fourth gen ryzen desktop chips oh right september
[3322.30 --> 3327.90]  2020 this is a rumor uh was originally on tech power up and tom's hardware sources at motherboard
[3327.90 --> 3334.70]  makers this is in quotes allegedly you know are apparently reporting that amd had ryzen 4000 series
[3334.70 --> 3341.52]  codename vermeer desktop processors um right that had wait what or no that they will arrive after
[3341.52 --> 3348.02]  august or september this year supposedly they were supposed to launch at computex in may but that's been
[3348.02 --> 3352.98]  pushed to september computex has been pushed to september so these are the successor to matisse and i could
[3352.98 --> 3361.16]  actually see like amd postponing a launch um you know two years ago that was not going to be a thing
[3361.16 --> 3366.32]  the instant they had chips that were even sort of like we saw this with the first gen ryzen launch
[3366.32 --> 3372.80]  the instant they had something serviceable they shipped it you know memory controller issues be
[3372.80 --> 3379.60]  damned you know bios updates that were coming after the launch reviews no problem we got this we got to
[3379.60 --> 3384.80]  get this stuff out the door we need people buying stuff we need money that's the state they were in
[3384.80 --> 3389.52]  they're a very different company today obviously they still like money who doesn't like money
[3389.52 --> 3398.64]  no one put up their hands literally no one okay but they're not in one person watching this it's
[3398.64 --> 3404.20]  like oh dude yeah they're not in they're not they're not in such a dire situation now at this point
[3404.20 --> 3411.22]  amd is competing against themselves so there's nothing wrong then with stockpiling some more chips for the
[3411.22 --> 3417.36]  launch you know sitting on it for a bit and launching a little bit later now i think that's the
[3417.36 --> 3425.04]  kind of behavior that turns at some point into complacency but these are extenuating circumstances
[3425.04 --> 3429.22]  the show they were planning to launch the bloody things that got postponed because of a worldwide
[3429.22 --> 3436.82]  pandemic so i'm not gonna do you think that is these days we've seen a lot of companies start uh start
[3436.82 --> 3444.12]  stopping to show up at shows uh starting to launch things at their own events or online events or
[3444.12 --> 3451.56]  whatever because of the uh general progression of the internet um so how important do you think it is
[3451.56 --> 3457.00]  to actually launch at computex um i think that
[3457.00 --> 3466.20]  i think to me if i was amd i wouldn't be super concerned about computex maybe it's bigger in the
[3466.20 --> 3471.64]  because i know amd's been been doing really really well in the enterprise space maybe launching at computex is
[3471.64 --> 3479.08]  more important for enterprise launches um i wouldn't say that i do think it's fair to say though that
[3479.08 --> 3486.76]  industry shows are as much about um getting together with your partners to to do things together as they
[3486.76 --> 3493.48]  are about just launching a product and that's why i think we've seen this pattern where um both amd and
[3493.48 --> 3497.88]  intel have used computex as a springboard for new products over the last couple of years
[3497.88 --> 3504.44]  um and there is something to be said for having all the pertinent media in one place at a time
[3504.44 --> 3510.28]  focused on you know whatever the biggest hottest thing during a show is um that that splash is
[3510.28 --> 3517.24]  something that to just buy it online would be very very expensive i mean google facebook all these
[3517.24 --> 3523.88]  companies that focus on online advertising have done a great job of commoditizing eyeballs
[3523.88 --> 3530.28]  um in such a way that there's there's really no way to get them for nothing whereas when you show
[3530.28 --> 3537.08]  up at a show it's not for nothing there's a cost to attending a show but it's a finite cost and the
[3537.08 --> 3542.60]  return on that investment if you have a great exciting product that people really want to hear about
[3542.60 --> 3551.24]  can be much greater than if you were to just try to buy ads online it's also nearly impossible to
[3551.24 --> 3557.88]  measure the return on investment which is like seen as kind of a good and a bad thing oh yeah if i
[3557.88 --> 3563.80]  was a show organizer i would see that as an awesome thing oh yeah if i was a brand i'd be like sorry
[3563.80 --> 3569.08]  what is it that you'd say is this worth it we're spending over a million dollars on this show and
[3569.08 --> 3576.12]  we have no idea what this is gonna mean there is no trackable return on this yeah apparently a child
[3576.12 --> 3581.88]  popped in behind me the door yeah i didn't actually see it but i the door is popped a little bit
[3581.88 --> 3590.60]  um and it wasn't before so oh yeah okay yeah that's fine apparently she escaped uh all right so what
[3590.60 --> 3596.12]  what are what's the rumor mill say the successor to matisse will be socket am4 multi-chip module okay
[3596.12 --> 3602.60]  that makes sense up to two uh cpu complex dies all right based on the zen 3 micro architecture which is
[3602.60 --> 3609.08]  supposed to be five nanometer no expected to be fabricated on a newer seven nanometer class process
[3609.08 --> 3616.60]  by tsmc so it's the return of the pluses ladies and gentlemen and there will be an io controller die
[3616.60 --> 3621.56]  okay so this is not a lot of detail i have heard some other rumors that it is going to be a significant
[3621.56 --> 3628.44]  uplift in performance and that could make intel very very nervous at this point we shot a video today
[3628.44 --> 3635.72]  um comparing intel to amd at about the same price point but like the very top of the stack so we
[3635.72 --> 3640.44]  didn't go with amd's 64 core thread ripper we went with their 32 core because that's where intel has a
[3640.44 --> 3651.24]  price comparable product and i think we're going amd for our transcode server oh that'd be a spicy video
[3651.24 --> 3658.04]  yeah so that's uh it's coming it's coming it's coming man my my whole life is going amd like like
[3658.68 --> 3663.72]  not gonna lie when i saw this in the doc i was like hmm maybe that's my maybe that's my new setup
[3663.72 --> 3667.72]  maybe that's it because you're already having trouble sometimes with streaming and playing
[3667.72 --> 3674.92]  certain games right yeah and one of the things that amd does really well even since gen one ryzen
[3674.92 --> 3682.04]  is handle multiple tasks extremely well and that's that's honestly and streaming that's that's
[3682.04 --> 3686.44]  probably the main thing i'm looking for in my processor right now because i'm very rarely doing
[3687.32 --> 3694.20]  like one thing i'm extremely often doing a ton of things at once so being able to massively
[3694.20 --> 3701.72]  parallelize things sounds fan freaking tastic um so yeah i mean you could probably upgrade now but if you
[3701.72 --> 3709.00]  wanted actually you could upgrade now you're like 5960x aren't you yes yeah you could definitely you
[3709.00 --> 3713.48]  could definitely upgrade now you know when you should you know when you're probably going to upgrade
[3713.48 --> 3719.56]  you're probably going to upgrade when the new ones come out and the ltt uh the the linus media group
[3719.56 --> 3728.12]  store staff only store i see okay so you're gonna go third gen ryzen but probably probably when the
[3728.12 --> 3734.04]  fourth gen ones come out i'm i or uh um yeah yeah when the fourth gen ones come out that makes sense
[3734.04 --> 3739.96]  that's a luke move all right yeah i get it i get it i'm on to you all right i still have my pixel 2 you
[3739.96 --> 3750.20]  know yeah yeah oh i i know i know it's doing great we've got some ltt store updates do you mind uh
[3750.20 --> 3756.68]  pulling that up there yeah so the folding at home limited edition shirt is now our most successful
[3756.68 --> 3762.68]  limited edition shirt ever that's really that's cool so thank you guys so much for your support
[3762.68 --> 3767.96]  and get this remember how i said that intel was going to match the money we raised so the money
[3767.96 --> 3775.16]  that we raised we are using towards um filament um and a person to run our print farm so we've actually
[3775.16 --> 3781.16]  shifted we're not printing uh face shields anymore we're printing oh shoot uh colin put a post on the
[3781.16 --> 3787.96]  forum uh with uh with a great update about what we're doing now uh unfortunately i don't remember
[3788.52 --> 3795.40]  exactly i don't even remember his um his username on the forum unfortunately but it's like ear
[3795.40 --> 3803.56]  somethings or something um uh i'm going to buy this i get i get a lot of shirts from work because like
[3803.56 --> 3807.96]  i'm supposed to promote it on wanch or whatever but i'm gonna buy this i want this shirt i think it's
[3807.96 --> 3811.40]  cool i think the qr code thing is cool i think what it supports is cool all that kind of stuff
[3811.40 --> 3815.88]  i'm gonna buy one myself the qr code is actually a little smaller than that it's less intrusive yeah
[3815.88 --> 3820.92]  yeah and isn't it a little lower as well i think so yeah that's just a markup for the back or where
[3820.92 --> 3826.52]  my little aimer is right now so it's our most successful shirt ever for a limited run shirt uh we've
[3826.52 --> 3831.96]  raised uh so right remember how i said that um right so what we're using the money for is um funding
[3831.96 --> 3839.64]  our print farm which is producing covid related stuff um if we run out of a need for that then
[3839.64 --> 3845.08]  we'll just find a cause related to covet and we will just donate the rest of it and and wrap it up
[3845.08 --> 3851.64]  at that point but for now um the print farm is is definitely valuable and uh there's you can you can
[3851.64 --> 3857.16]  get updates on the forum uh colin's been posting about it over there um but there was also the donation
[3857.16 --> 3861.88]  that was going to go directly to folding at home where intel said that they would match the money
[3861.88 --> 3867.96]  that we raised directly to folding at home and to a maximum of 40 grand we have raised over 35 grand
[3867.96 --> 3876.52]  so far so we are getting super close to intel writing a 40 000 check to folding at home um because of
[3876.52 --> 3882.12]  our community's support through this shirt so super cool um really proud of you guys really proud of
[3882.12 --> 3887.48]  ourselves obviously we helped a little bit um this was actually i don't think she's off her
[3887.48 --> 3894.20]  probation yet so i can't give her name yet but this was actually whipped up by our new designer so um it
[3894.20 --> 3900.84]  was kind of based on it was based on lloyd's sort of aesthetic sensibilities and um similar kind of color
[3900.84 --> 3906.84]  palette but um yeah she she did this one up for us and i think it's really great uh she's got some
[3906.84 --> 3910.76]  she's got some cool stuff in the pipeline that's going to be coming and hopefully i'll be able to talk
[3910.76 --> 3917.88]  about her at some point but um i've had a lot of people question me um about why it is that we keep
[3917.88 --> 3922.76]  people anonymous for the first three months of their employment so bc has what's called a probationary
[3922.76 --> 3929.80]  period which means that if um you decide that it's not a good fit as the employer or the employee if
[3929.80 --> 3935.48]  either of you says you know what this really wasn't the right move for me there's a no strings attached
[3935.48 --> 3941.72]  um period of three months 90 days where you can just walk away um so there's there's no requirement
[3941.72 --> 3946.28]  to give notice to the employer from the employee side and there's no requirement to give severance
[3946.28 --> 3953.00]  from the employer side so that is intended to be used as as a trial period to make sure that everybody's
[3953.00 --> 3958.68]  happy with this new relationship because um leaving a job and dismissing someone from a job are more
[3958.68 --> 3964.28]  complicated both of them are more complicated after the probationary period so it's best to sort those things out
[3964.28 --> 3970.36]  um early on in the process um so the reason that we don't mention people is because
[3971.88 --> 3979.72]  when people become public facing uh members of the linus media group team all of a sudden they start
[3979.72 --> 3986.52]  acquiring like this following and people get attached to them and we've had instances where things have not
[3986.52 --> 3992.52]  worked out and the last thing we want to do is create this expectation with our audience that this
[3992.52 --> 3998.04]  person they've developed an attachment to is going to continue to be there and then they they get kind
[3998.04 --> 4004.44]  of yanked away so we we try really hard to um vet our staff and make sure that they're a really good fit
[4004.44 --> 4011.16]  before we go public with them that's that's basically why and part of it i would argue is you want them to
[4011.16 --> 4020.84]  be able to see and get used to what what i guess it means to be in the public eye um and kind of decide
[4020.84 --> 4026.36]  if that's actually something they want yeah it used to be something we required it used to be a requirement
[4026.36 --> 4032.52]  um to work here you just had to have a public twitter and uh when we did credits for example or if you were
[4032.52 --> 4038.04]  on wanshow that had to be accessible there had to be some way for the public to talk to you because i
[4038.04 --> 4044.04]  considered it just part of the role of being at a social media first company like linus media group
[4044.04 --> 4049.00]  um nowadays um i think officially that is still the policy but it's not really enforced anymore
[4049.00 --> 4054.68]  so if people want to be more out of the public eye we we respect that it was just when we were a
[4054.68 --> 4060.44]  really small team it would have been too yeah it would have been complicated to try to kind of have
[4060.44 --> 4065.32]  to keep people secret like we tried to do that weird thing with the nicknames but that was dumb that was my bad
[4065.32 --> 4077.00]  i liked mine slick reference year it like sort of broke down after that yeah yeah it's fine it's
[4077.00 --> 4081.48]  got it's it's dead it's dead now it's dead now people just use their real names so anyway we're
[4081.48 --> 4085.48]  going to be closing sales on the folding at home limited edition shirt this sunday night
[4085.48 --> 4089.96]  um we can't just keep taking orders for it forever because we have to print them and send them out at
[4089.96 --> 4094.84]  some point so if you want one you got to get your order in before the end of this weekend pacific time
[4095.40 --> 4099.72]  also we just got a resupply of lanyards both black and orange are back in stock and we've got more
[4099.72 --> 4105.64]  stock of cpu hard drive and gpu t-shirts all sizes are now available we have stealth hoodie in stock we're
[4105.64 --> 4113.00]  finally starting to starting to come out of that supply um interruption that we went through so guys you
[4113.00 --> 4119.32]  can pick up all your ltt store needs make sure though the highest priority is the folding at home shirt so
[4119.32 --> 4123.32]  make sure you got one of those in the cart there's really no drawback to ordering that one now
[4123.32 --> 4126.92]  especially because it's not going to delay your order because we're going to go get those printed
[4126.92 --> 4132.28]  next week so it should ship in the next couple weeks or so cool or well it looks like the mystery
[4132.28 --> 4138.60]  shirt is also still available the mystery shirt the mystery meat shirt has become one of our most
[4138.60 --> 4145.08]  popular items which is hilarious so people there's a lot of people evidently that just don't care what
[4145.08 --> 4151.16]  shirt they get they just want a mystery meat shirt well it's also really crazy cheap for the quality
[4151.16 --> 4155.48]  of shirt it is and this is like i'm completely detached from this whole situation but that's like
[4156.68 --> 4163.24]  nuts i don't think i've ever seen a creator merch i i don't i think you rarely see creator merch where
[4163.24 --> 4168.60]  it's 20 a shirt let alone creator merch where they're like i don't know which one but it's only 13
[4168.60 --> 4174.68]  dollars a shirt but what if it's like an ugly one that you don't like what one's ugly well um
[4175.96 --> 4180.44]  yeah i mean none of them are ugly per se well okay what if it's one you don't like
[4181.40 --> 4185.88]  there you know what if what if like all of what if pink doesn't go well with your eye color i don't
[4185.88 --> 4196.60]  know it's 13 dollars clearly clearly you are the audience for this shirt 100 that's the one i would get
[4196.60 --> 4204.04]  along with the uh the folding one how is the linus shirt doing uh i actually don't know that's kind
[4204.04 --> 4209.00]  of a good question for nick that was that was a nick initiative he was like oh should we do like a
[4209.00 --> 4215.08]  hashtag linus shirt and i was like yeah i i guess so sure why not if that it's just it's the kind of
[4215.08 --> 4221.88]  thing people are going to show up like six years from now at ltx 2025 or something i got one of these
[4221.88 --> 4225.72]  and they're going to be wearing this shirt and it's going to be like you know classic right like it looks
[4225.72 --> 4231.16]  like they've never worn any other shirt like the text is all like cracked and faded now and like
[4231.16 --> 4236.20]  it's barely even black it's like gray now and they're going to be like i believe still you know
[4236.20 --> 4244.60]  hashtag linus oh my god oh you nerds i love it i love it i love it but you nerds uh all right oh
[4244.60 --> 4250.04]  apparently we've sold a couple hundred lionesses there you go nice so it's actually it's going to be a
[4250.04 --> 4256.52]  very exclusive club that's uh that's a pretty low sales shirt compared to the folding shirt like so
[4256.52 --> 4264.60]  we raised 35 grand that's not including like the costs for the shirts and printing yeah okay um yeah
[4264.60 --> 4270.84]  it's also just a cool shirt like i really like it i like the design a lot my personal favorites right
[4270.84 --> 4278.28]  now i think are that one um gpu i'm still really into i love the purple on gpu um
[4280.52 --> 4286.04]  stealth hoodie obviously i love hard drive hard drive i really like hard drive hasn't been as popular as
[4286.04 --> 4291.80]  i feel like it should be uh ram has been super popular i think cpu is number one though i think cpu
[4291.80 --> 4299.24]  overtook constellation at some point constellations is probably my number one then it would be
[4300.04 --> 4306.28]  processor and folding at home like trading off for two and three depending on how i'm feeling i think
[4306.28 --> 4311.16]  processor goes really well with uh stealth hoodie though like i really like the way that the uh the
[4311.16 --> 4316.84]  the diamond the top of the diamond comes up through the uh the stealth hoodie anyway we should uh do we
[4316.84 --> 4322.52]  have any more topics no i think it's other topics that aren't just oh we could talk about the intel xc
[4322.52 --> 4332.68]  hp gpu 500 watts so at ces we saw the low powered xc lp but now there are leaks for the high powered xc hp
[4333.80 --> 4339.80]  so the tdp is expected to be 500 watts at 48 volt what does that even mean it's expected to have a
[4339.80 --> 4345.32]  chiplet design so there's going to be multiple dies kind of like zen and it'll use tiles of execution
[4345.32 --> 4351.32]  units each one with up to four cores per eu this could end up very interesting because nvidia
[4351.32 --> 4355.96]  seems to i mean we don't know much about their upcoming as it ampere i think is the upcoming one
[4355.96 --> 4364.68]  um but they they still seem to be pretty on the monolithic die bandwagon and this chiplet approach
[4364.68 --> 4370.28]  could be disruptive um chiplet feels like the future man so we could potentially have specs like
[4370.28 --> 4380.12]  this um so intel xc hp 12.5 one tile gpu sorry what is this 512 execution units that would be 4096 cores
[4380.12 --> 4387.96]  12.2 teraflop wait a second hp 12.52 tile would be 300 watts oh so the first one was 150 this one
[4387.96 --> 4395.80]  would be 300 and that would be what assuming 1.25 gigahertz 20.48 teraflops that would be pretty good
[4396.52 --> 4403.40]  um and then a four tile version 36 teraflops lower clock speed to save some power 1.1 gigahertz
[4403.40 --> 4415.88]  um at 400 to 500 watts okay i just love the 16 384 cores yeah uh it's unclear if a four tile version
[4415.88 --> 4424.84]  will show up and if it does show up it probably won't be for consumers um but a two tile uh 20 teraflop
[4424.84 --> 4430.44]  could end up being actually competitive so the 500 watt one is server only and that's the one that
[4430.44 --> 4437.24]  requires 48 volt power oh my goodness okay well we'll see good luck intel um this could be this
[4437.24 --> 4443.88]  could be finally the thing to come in you know knock nvidia down a peg um which to be clear i'm not
[4443.88 --> 4448.92]  saying nvidia makes bad products they make great products and they in the absence of come in the
[4448.92 --> 4454.20]  utter absence of competition they have still like made new products at least but boy have their prices
[4454.20 --> 4458.92]  gotten out of control one concern that i have though is intel really going to be the one to
[4459.56 --> 4463.96]  bring nvidia's prices under control or are they just both going to be expensive i think they're both
[4463.96 --> 4468.84]  going to be expensive that would be my guess with that said if intel is hungry for market share it's
[4468.84 --> 4475.88]  not like they can't be aggressive they have been aggressive at times in the past sure i it doesn't
[4475.88 --> 4482.12]  feel like the current intel if you know what i mean but current intel is undergoing a bit of a
[4482.12 --> 4489.48]  culture change right now i'm willing to bet sure yeah i think that would also be fair i don't i
[4489.48 --> 4493.40]  haven't heard anything about that but i wouldn't be surprised if that was something they were very
[4493.40 --> 4497.16]  actively working on because uh they probably kind of need to
[4500.76 --> 4506.60]  yeah is that it super chats yeah super chats uh i think we ended up with quite a few super chats
[4506.60 --> 4510.28]  today so i apologize in advance but i don't think we're going to be able to get through all of them
[4510.28 --> 4513.40]  thanks robert mail you send a super chat like every week what are you doing
[4515.24 --> 4520.36]  um liam kelly scrapyard roars idea ultimate work from home setup but only one person from the team
[4520.36 --> 4526.12]  can be outside at a time covet style and they can only be outside for an hour okay i've never heard
[4526.12 --> 4531.40]  this guidance only one of you outside at a time for only an hour i don't think that's how the
[4531.40 --> 4536.20]  quarantining works okay like neat idea work from home setup but i don't think we're probably going to
[4536.20 --> 4544.04]  do that anytime soon thanks dr napal is just a cheaper streaming setup yeah basically like honestly
[4544.04 --> 4549.80]  i have ever since the the streaming upgrade i have streamed a couple times from my desk but i have
[4549.80 --> 4557.24]  mostly used it for making video calls quickly and easily like i can just whip my mic over here and i'm
[4557.24 --> 4564.52]  ready to go it's been amazing um rob p wants to know if there's any floatplane updates you can share
[4566.44 --> 4567.64]  thanks for asking rob p
[4571.80 --> 4578.76]  let me just give me one second yeah take a look uh status.flowplane.com
[4578.76 --> 4582.52]  should i go look at it now too sure
[4585.96 --> 4589.32]  everything's green this is a new thing neat
[4591.08 --> 4595.96]  it's been kind of in the works for a while status.flowplane.com was was up and working
[4596.92 --> 4602.84]  uh a fair while ago but this is a a much better version i believe this time it's kind of here to
[4602.84 --> 4608.36]  stay um so if you're if you're into the kind of like stats for nerds stuff there's a little bit of
[4608.36 --> 4613.80]  that here um and if you if you're just interested in like oh i'm having an issue with something or
[4613.80 --> 4618.44]  whatever else you can you can take a look on your own you can also contact customer service do whatever
[4618.44 --> 4623.64]  else you would like to do but you can also peek in here and there's the past incident summary thing
[4623.64 --> 4630.36]  which is which is interesting a lot of these won't really affect anybody uh but you can see the the
[4630.36 --> 4637.72]  type of stuff that we may or may not be working on um and they may or may not affect you but yeah
[4637.72 --> 4643.48]  that's a that's a new thing worked on by one of the newer but at this point he's been on the team for
[4643.48 --> 4652.36]  quite a while so i wouldn't really say new member um but yeah it's cool there's also uh you did
[4653.40 --> 4657.32]  let creators you're interested know we are reopening the gates in terms of recruitment
[4657.32 --> 4663.88]  uh we we paused there for a little bit and uh we're we're reaching out to some creators right now
[4663.88 --> 4669.24]  uh to get things kind of moving again uh but if there's anyone that you think would be a good fit
[4669.24 --> 4676.20]  on floatplane i we would we would love to talk to them so uh you can also just contact customer support
[4676.20 --> 4683.08]  and be like hey i think this person would be a good fit for these kind of reasons um and maybe we'll
[4683.08 --> 4690.68]  we'll try to reach out it's a dub session says who the hold on hold on who the buys ltt underwear
[4691.24 --> 4699.24]  that's like for nerds it's really comfortable it's great it's probably the best underwear i've ever had
[4699.24 --> 4705.80]  um and i have also heard that from a lot of other people and again i'm technically impartial here
[4705.80 --> 4712.76]  jamilo asks is the beard here to stay no i'm definitely gonna shave what's the cutoff date
[4712.76 --> 4716.76]  this is my quarantine what's the cutoff point yeah so it's the whole time you're in quarantine yeah
[4716.76 --> 4723.48]  so when i go back to when i start working from the office again i am going to clean myself with a razor
[4724.68 --> 4730.04]  uh carp whisperer says first live show i got to give that mun to pay respect to the very good looking
[4730.04 --> 4735.24]  linus beard wonder how the wifey feels but actually she didn't like it for the first like four or five
[4735.24 --> 4739.16]  days when it was still really prickly but it's getting softer now but she but yeah it's getting
[4739.16 --> 4745.00]  a lot softer now and she actually doesn't mind it that much uh she has asked if i'm keeping it but
[4745.00 --> 4751.00]  she was asking not like you're not keeping that are you like it was you know different different tone
[4751.00 --> 4756.52]  you know um david says what has been the benefits of staying at home uh the benefit was that i was
[4756.52 --> 4761.96]  coughing and i shouldn't be at the office um asks how many lmg staff watch live streams uh they're not
[4761.96 --> 4768.76]  supposed to it's not considered work so there you go it's technically a day off uh no we're in office
[4768.76 --> 4776.52]  today we have monday off oh okay yeah we never do fridays off because uh wencho and that is legal in bc
[4776.52 --> 4781.24]  you can substitute a stat as long as there's yeah you're allowed to move stats around so we never take
[4781.24 --> 4790.44]  a friday stat okay europe just does both so that must be nice how nice for the europeans too bad we're
[4790.44 --> 4796.68]  not european luke i i'm not complaining i did stuff today i did work today and i'm working monday united
[4796.68 --> 4804.36]  roller says uh uh love both of your beards and amd loves the 10 nanometer process okay i have no idea
[4804.36 --> 4811.56]  what that second part's about but thank you um all right uh ryan says why teams and not slack
[4812.20 --> 4818.12]  um i think with uh lmg it was because we already had office 365 anyway and then teams was like another
[4818.12 --> 4825.88]  couple dollars a month to add to it flow plane does not use teams and um i mean no offense to the teams
[4826.44 --> 4833.48]  team uh but after the limited amount of use i've had to have uh for interacting with linus media group
[4833.48 --> 4839.48]  people i think we're probably going to stay that way uh yeah i probably would do that if i were you
[4839.48 --> 4844.84]  uh it would be super great if it didn't sign me out of everything all the time yeah yeah it's pretty
[4844.84 --> 4852.04]  annoying on a random note jason sintich sent a hundred dollars to ask me to move the wanshow title
[4852.04 --> 4856.20]  bar to the bottom of the screen there you are sir
[4856.20 --> 4865.96]  now i'll move it back you just got trolled you got trolled you done got trolled jason
[4867.40 --> 4872.36]  how hard did he get trolled pretty hard pretty hard yep pretty hard i did it and then i undid it
[4873.08 --> 4877.56]  dang ouch apparently i look like i'm trying to cosplay as luke thanks owen
[4877.56 --> 4886.28]  you apparently need ridiculously longer hair i need a haircut so bad it's actually here i wonder if
[4888.12 --> 4895.48]  wow wow are you just gonna go full thor at this point like and just do the long hair like
[4895.48 --> 4902.92]  there's technically two options i could do that um or i i considering i have no access to
[4902.92 --> 4910.20]  barbers uh my girlfriend will attempt to shorten it and then attempt to shorten it i like that that's
[4910.20 --> 4916.20]  nice i don't i don't know what we would do from there but if it got screwed up just buzzer down
[4916.20 --> 4921.32]  it's kind of it's kind of one of the two directions i think if i wanted to go for long hair now would be
[4921.32 --> 4927.88]  the time but i don't think i would work that well with it personally you don't think so i don't know
[4927.88 --> 4932.76]  i i think it could work for you i think the whole like norse god look could be all right
[4934.60 --> 4939.00]  i could give it a shot i don't know maybe we should straw poll it it takes a long time to give something
[4939.00 --> 4942.84]  like that a shot but then the worst case scenario is at the end you just donate it
[4944.04 --> 4948.04]  although yeah i think you would take such poor care of it that it might not be donatable
[4948.76 --> 4952.36]  i'm not i'm not trying to judge i'm not trying to be judgy here i'm just
[4952.36 --> 4960.60]  i'm just making an observation the fact that i don't know what taking good care of it would mean
[4960.60 --> 4966.12]  is probably enough well conditioner would be a start i don't know if i've ever used that
[4966.12 --> 4971.40]  yeah intentionally i'm sure you haven't luke i'm sure you have accidentally because i'm like what is
[4971.40 --> 4978.28]  this and then i realized what i did because i grabbed the wrong bottle and then yeah oh boy um yeah
[4978.28 --> 4982.04]  yeah that's that's a thing all right um my girlfriend's yelling at me what
[4986.12 --> 4992.36]  apparently she buys my shampoo with conditioner uh and says that she takes care of my hair because
[4992.36 --> 4998.20]  of that so okay maybe my carry my hair is well taken care of you can tell her is her name public now or no
[4998.20 --> 5001.16]  is your name like a twitch streamer now
[5005.16 --> 5011.08]  hey is she like streaming right now what that was very delayed yeah
[5014.20 --> 5018.12]  her name is public okay all right actually i think she might be streaming i'm not sure okay
[5018.12 --> 5022.76]  whatever it doesn't matter the point is you can tell emma she doesn't know what she's talking about
[5022.76 --> 5029.64]  because the combination shampoo conditioner is not a substitute for actual conditioner and she
[5029.64 --> 5033.72]  i'm sure she knows that she's got to know that she might be taking care of you but she's not doing
[5033.72 --> 5043.00]  a very good job luke so you can tell her i said that that's great i'll uh i'll uh i'll mention that later
[5043.00 --> 5049.80]  you let her you let her know you let her know later okay um does that because she knows i definitely
[5049.80 --> 5053.88]  wouldn't use two different things so she might as well get the combo one it's probably the best
[5053.88 --> 5059.16]  she can do yeah she's probably right um all right the morton the morton and chris says a hello from
[5059.16 --> 5067.00]  denmark uh people are stupid 5g is fine okay ps luke you should buy an astro a40 headset no
[5069.88 --> 5071.96]  i don't think he should um
[5073.56 --> 5079.16]  yeah how long is that headset existed the a40 like forever
[5079.80 --> 5086.04]  like a40 has been around for an insanely long time for 1 000 years and in that time
[5086.04 --> 5091.56]  human technology has improved a lot and the a40 headset as far as i can tell has not
[5092.12 --> 5097.96]  the same i remember that from like some of the first paxes i went to like this is this is a very
[5097.96 --> 5105.08]  very long time um christian jones says rich due to buying stocks and crypto during the downturn
[5105.08 --> 5110.60]  just bought two displates here's the money i saved from the coupon code thanks brah
[5112.04 --> 5118.84]  uh also says hopefully ltx 2020 still goes on um tickets bought flight tbd so you can expect some
[5118.84 --> 5123.96]  kind of news about that from us within the next couple of weeks um where we're still keeping a very
[5123.96 --> 5131.32]  very close eye on things i had to make a channel to comment says you should review the pine phone from
[5131.32 --> 5135.48]  pine 64 when it's out we probably would like to have a look at that actually that's a that's a good
[5135.48 --> 5144.92]  idea so yes we will we'll probably do that um pine phone uh put on tracker yep all right duly noted
[5144.92 --> 5150.84]  thank you what else we got here uh probably only have time for a couple more thanks gregory reed
[5150.84 --> 5157.48]  thanks kinestick um any chance we could eventually get a limited run of hardware shirts in a light color
[5157.48 --> 5163.96]  black is not as nice to wear in hot climates that's fair um black is the easiest color for us to get
[5163.96 --> 5170.20]  good supply of that's the main problem we have been hard at work on sourcing an equivalent quality shirt
[5170.20 --> 5177.00]  at a fair price from a factory that doesn't abuse its workers and we're having a hard time there you go
[5177.80 --> 5184.04]  that's the that's the 100 honest truth for why we don't have other colors um it's hard for us to
[5184.04 --> 5188.52]  launch a shirt when we don't know that we're going to have regular supply of that shirt and the
[5188.52 --> 5195.64]  distribution for our shirt partners in canada has not been consistent enough um constellation we've
[5195.64 --> 5201.16]  pulled off all at times we haven't at times we've been out of stock but we've mostly pulled it off just
[5201.16 --> 5205.72]  because we order massive quantities of it because it sells really well and we just stockpile it and
[5205.72 --> 5211.80]  we just kind of eat that that that cost of inventorying all those shirts that's really the only way for us to do it so
[5211.80 --> 5215.96]  when we want to try to experiment and just kind of do like new and interesting stuff or like limited
[5215.96 --> 5221.40]  run stuff it's easiest to do it in black i mean i've wanted a wider color palette for our shirts for a
[5221.40 --> 5227.32]  long time just because um wearing black shirts in the thumbnails just makes them less eye eye-catching
[5227.32 --> 5232.20]  and so i would like to have a more um colorful wardrobe but it's just something we haven't really
[5232.20 --> 5240.36]  been able to pull off so far what about like the the the really light gray that seems that's a
[5240.36 --> 5246.92]  relatively popular shirt color i think we'd um yeah we'd have to look into it
[5248.68 --> 5253.08]  yeah i mean that's more of a question for like nick at this point i don't even sure yeah yeah
[5253.96 --> 5259.64]  jd hagg says there's not a console flame war right now because sony destroyed microsoft this generation
[5260.20 --> 5265.88]  also kind of true also kind of true if i was a microsoft fanboy i'd probably be just kind of i'd
[5265.88 --> 5271.56]  probably have my head down for the time biding my time it's the look of it so far is that the new
[5271.56 --> 5276.84]  xbox is gonna be pretty crazy okay i have my hunch leans towards them right now last super chat from mark
[5277.72 --> 5284.28]  persikian do y'all think the ps5's 5.5 gigabit per second ssd will actually make a difference in game
[5284.28 --> 5289.24]  development over the series x there's a gigabit or gigabyte it must be gigabyte can't be gigabit that's not
[5289.24 --> 5300.20]  fast um no why would it like loading a game from a ram disk is still like cpu limited at this point
[5300.20 --> 5307.00]  um even on very powerful computers like yeah having a having fast storage is like good and for certain
[5307.00 --> 5312.68]  types of games like where you're streaming data off the ssd as you move into new environments and stuff
[5312.68 --> 5319.08]  like that you might see less hitching but in terms of like changing the way game developers develop
[5319.08 --> 5326.52]  their games i i kind of doubt it um i mean unless it's used as like a flexing demo of some sort that
[5326.52 --> 5333.56]  sony like tries to support yeah you know what i mean because ultimately any game asset that is rendered
[5333.56 --> 5337.80]  on the screen is going to be half there's going to have to be loaded into gpu memory that's where it
[5337.80 --> 5342.60]  has to come from so that just comes down to how quickly you can move things in and out of gpu memory
[5342.60 --> 5351.00]  yeah yeah all right that's it for the show today you guys thank you for tuning in we'll see you
[5351.00 --> 5356.76]  again next week same bat time same bat channel bye bye bye bye bye okay i'm gonna end the youtube
[5356.76 --> 5360.68]  stream here we go we're gonna try and do things in the right order for a change i've left the youtube
[5360.68 --> 5367.72]  stream like the event live while having also stopped obs and it just like leaves this empty event
[5367.72 --> 5370.04]  on yeah it's genius all right so we'll end that
