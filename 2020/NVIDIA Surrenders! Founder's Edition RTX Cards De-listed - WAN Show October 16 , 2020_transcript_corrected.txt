[0.00 → 4.88] spinning up I was going to say actually it'll start whenever this thing decides that it will
[6.16 → 13.20] and welcome to the Wang show ladies and gentlemen we've got a terrific show for you guys today with
[13.20 → 21.04] all kinds of great tech news this just in AMD's dozen 5000 series is rumoured to be able to hit as
[21.04 → 30.48] high as six gigahertz when it's overclocked when will AMD stop when will they take away the pain
[31.68 → 37.92] in other news this week Microsoft strikes a profit sharing deal with GameStop we don't have a ton of
[37.92 → 43.92] details as to like how exactly this arrangement works and whether it will keep GameStop's
[43.92 → 50.00] bloated corpse from finally sinking below the surface of the lake but uh hey you know if i
[50.00 → 54.08] was GameStop I'd be willing to do just about anything to stay alive too what else we got Luke
[55.04 → 62.00] uh NVIDIA is no longer going to be selling 3000 series cards direct online what this will uh
[62.00 → 67.04] transition into future releases as well but how will people get founders edition
[68.88 → 76.24] um we'll talk about that later also AMD motherboard with a soldered a9 9820 to offer performance
[76.24 → 87.12] comparable to the Xbox One S interesting wait what I don't know why that matters, but it's in the
[87.12 → 90.72] dock, and we'll talk about it later fantastic
[90.72 → 98.80] oh TLDR it's probably the Xbox One SOC interesting
[102.08 → 102.96] well then
[105.44 → 106.40] how about that
[106.40 → 120.48] oh shoot I forgot to put the um I forgot to put the thing in their yeah I didn't put the lower
[120.48 → 123.52] thirds so I guess we're just going to have to skip that okay cool
[123.52 → 135.92] all right oh sorry got a little bit of a bug there sorry, sorry about that I love this thing so much
[136.80 → 143.76] all right why don't we jump right into it with NVIDIA no longer selling three thousand series
[143.76 → 152.00] cards direct online so this was originally posted by pc mag and Tom's guide and basically if you wanted to
[152.00 → 159.68] buy an NVIDIA founders edition card well I guess you're just a lot um because NVIDIA is not going
[159.68 → 166.08] to be selling them on nvidia.com the only way to get one will apparently be through Best Buy in the USA
[166.08 → 172.40] with international outlets not yet revealed you know what that's not as surprising as you might think
[172.40 → 178.72] because as I recall when NVIDIA first introduced their founders' edition cards which would have been
[178.72 → 187.36] this was that seven well oh was it before that dang I can't remember when they transitioned from
[187.36 → 196.08] founders edition or from reference cards to founders edition cards yeah I'm not 100 sure was it 900 series
[196.08 → 203.92] or 1000 must have been maxwell I don't know maybe it was before that actually was it 6 680. oh, yeah I don't
[203.92 → 211.28] remember but NVIDIA did experiment with making those cards exclusively available at Best Buy that was
[211.28 → 216.24] one of the first in fact I think that was before they were even selling direct on nvidia.com I believe
[216.24 → 222.56] best buy was the first place that you were able to get a built by NVIDIA card and I remember it being
[222.56 → 231.76] like a big hubbub in the industry because AMD famously transitioned from building built by ATI at the time
[231.76 → 237.76] built by ATI card so you could buy like a first party card to no longer providing those and leaning
[237.76 → 245.12] on their ad-in board partners and then NVIDIA who had traditionally never provided a built by NVIDIA card
[245.12 → 250.80] and had always had ad-in board partners now was all of a sudden transitioning to their own built by NVIDIA
[250.80 → 258.48] cards these founders edition cards and um there was a bunch of upset about well okay NVIDIA is
[258.48 → 264.72] just trying to salvage no not salvage trying to grab even more margin for themselves because
[264.72 → 271.44] if there's anywhere from five to eight percent profit in a card like a RTX 3080 let's say for
[271.44 → 278.08] example at each the ad and board partner and the retailer level well hey that's NVIDIA effectively
[278.08 → 284.24] making anywhere from 10 to 15 percent more per card on the ones that they sell for themselves so it
[284.24 → 290.40] creates a bit of a conflict of interest because if NVIDIA's partners are relying on them to fairly
[290.40 → 295.76] distribute allocation of these hot chips that everybody wants and are basically like printing
[295.76 → 301.20] money at this point like the more of them NVIDIA can make the more money everyone in the ecosystem can
[301.20 → 307.20] make um and NVIDIA is the one responsible for doing it so if they have this incentive to take them all for
[307.20 → 312.96] themselves and just sell them themselves for more profit then you know why would they send you know
[313.52 → 318.48] MSI or Asus or VGA's full allocation to them why wouldn't they just hold some back for themselves
[318.48 → 326.08] so um best buy has been uh one quick thing just to insert apparently it happened a lot later
[326.08 → 332.08] than I remember it happening um I think that's just because the visual style didn't change much but
[332.08 → 340.48] uh it was uh one thousand series cards really yeah oh all right yeah I guess that does kind of
[340.48 → 347.20] make sense okay once I like to saw the article I was like oh yeah okay i just I thought it happened earlier
[347.20 → 352.64] than that yeah I thought there was one before that too I thought there was like a 760 or something
[352.64 → 358.96] like that like much earlier I thought it was 700 series as well so maybe we're we're tripping on something
[358.96 → 363.92] but I'm founding articles about like what the heck is a founders' edition card, and they're talking about
[363.92 → 373.68] the 1070 and 1080 got it okay well there you go okay why don't we uh have a look so why would
[373.68 → 380.08] NVIDIA stop selling themselves because like I said obviously they make another you know five to seven or
[380.08 → 384.64] maybe even eight percent profit if they just sell the founders editions through their own website
[384.64 → 390.32] the reason is that they have basically thrown in the towel and said well we just can't
[391.04 → 397.52] shucks we just can't figure out how to do this uh without letting the bots get all the graphics cards
[397.52 → 403.52] so we're going to leave it to the professionals here, and it wouldn't surprise me if in the future
[404.48 → 409.20] NVIDIA went back to selling founders editions through their own site once the demand dies down a little bit
[409.20 → 414.48] but for now they're going to leave it to Best Buy because Best Buy has been overall a more reliable
[414.48 → 419.44] storefront for card sales when compared to NVIDIA, although it should be noted that that's not by a
[419.44 → 425.12] huge margin a recent restocking saw best buys 3080 founders edition card staying available for only several
[425.12 → 435.76] minutes, so none of this is the ideal situation for NVIDIA but um if they're going to come out and say that
[435.76 → 441.44] they want to make an earnest effort to eliminate bots or not eliminate, but you know minimize the
[441.44 → 447.44] effects of bots and scalpers on availability of RTX 3000 series cards then they're going to have to
[447.44 → 452.48] put their money where their mouth is and take a bit of a hit to their profit in order to make sure that
[453.04 → 458.96] customers are actually getting their cards it'll be fascinating to see how all of these
[458.96 → 465.60] shortages play into AMD's upcoming launch I mean we know big Nazi is coming in the coming weeks here
[465.60 → 473.44] and uh it wouldn't surprise me based on what AMD has done for their past cards if we saw a hard
[473.44 → 480.24] launch with availability and if AMD manages to pull that off, and they're even remotely competitive
[480.96 → 485.04] they might get a lot of sales just because people can't even buy the other things yeah just because
[485.04 → 491.52] NVIDIA can't ship a graphics card to save their lives it's a pretty interesting concept but I could
[491.52 → 496.32] definitely see it like i I know I have a few friends that are looking to get 3000 series cards
[496.80 → 503.92] um and they've been struggling and not succeeding so it's interesting this is a great
[503.92 → 508.96] comment from ninja man away over on float plane I've never understood why people would buy a founder's
[508.96 → 514.96] edition card rather than a third party card when the third party cards are normally better wonderful
[514.96 → 521.04] comment, so there are a couple of things here the founder's edition or back in the day the
[521.04 → 527.44] reference edition cards were typically the like minimum but still decent
[528.32 → 535.68] board spec to build a graphics card based on that GPU they'd have no frills or extra gimmicks or
[535.68 → 541.84] anything like that typically no RGB lighting um no factory overclock to speak of because they were
[541.84 → 549.28] they were meant to be representative of the know NVIDIA approved experience one thing if I can
[549.28 → 556.56] insert is also before this generation uh well and I guess it yeah before this generation because of
[556.56 → 564.96] the troop swap um they were also blowers yes which in some cases people like really wanted that
[564.96 → 569.92] due to certain airflow restrictions etc sorry keep going so if you had a small form factor case back in
[569.92 → 576.32] the GTX 1000 days then you might have wanted uh like a founder's edition style card because it's the
[576.32 → 583.44] only way to keep your other components from getting suffocated with RTX 2000 well that option went away
[583.44 → 590.88] anyway and NVIDIA's founders editions moved to like a two fan um sorry whatever the opposite of a blower style
[590.88 → 595.04] is so the one that just recirculates hot air in your case it's escaping me at the moment doesn't matter it's
[595.04 → 601.36] really not the point oh yeah they did yeah never mind yeah so that was with RTX 2000 um now with RTX
[601.36 → 608.56] 3000 NVIDIA has actually positioned the founders' edition cards as less of a baseline for performance
[608.56 → 615.12] and more as a premium option making them not only priced higher than the cards that you would buy from
[615.12 → 620.48] the likes of an Asus or MSI or whatever else actually last gen they were priced higher if I were
[620.48 → 624.96] actually I think they've founders edition has always been more expensive just because that cooler costs so
[624.96 → 630.96] much to make like 1000 series was I think a hundred dollars higher on the 80 and I think it was
[630.96 → 638.08] like 60 or 75 higher on the 70. So they're not only priced higher because of their fancy pretty cooler
[638.08 → 648.24] but NVIDIA put a ton of work into making the RTX 3000 founders edition cards um really awesome actually
[648.24 → 654.16] like okay there are a couple of things here one the first party NVIDIA cards did not have any of those uh black
[654.16 → 661.04] screening issues that plagued some RTX 3000s and two the cooler on them is actually outstanding the way
[661.04 → 667.12] that it not only helps keep the card cool but also helps cool your system and I don't have any third
[667.12 → 674.16] party confirmation of this but what it looks like to me is that NVIDIA is creating yet another rift with
[674.16 → 681.84] their partners by offering cards that um their partners don't have any realistic expectation of
[681.84 → 687.60] properly competing with like did you see NVIDIA's video about what went into the design of the
[687.60 → 694.48] thermal solution for the RTX 3080 yeah and i I do also agree with what you're saying it's its an
[694.48 → 705.36] interesting position um and i I think it's a much more attractive play to people purchasing cards than
[705.36 → 711.52] than previous founders editions offerings absolutely but what happened was they gave themselves an
[711.52 → 719.28] extremely unfair advantage yes NVIDIA obviously the way that those guys hold their cards so close to
[719.28 → 726.08] their chest I pretty much guarantee you that their partners had the minimum possible amount of
[726.08 → 732.72] time to work on their uh to work on their board designs for these new chips whereas NVIDIA was sitting
[732.72 → 738.64] there with first party knowledge throughout the entire development process of this product
[738.64 → 748.08] knowing okay hey we've got a 400 watt problem to solve you know how can we solve it if I'm Asus or if
[748.08 → 756.24] I'm VGA or I'm galaxy or whoever else you know I'm going okay sorry what I have a 400 watt problem to solve
[756.24 → 762.24] like uh uh uh and I'm scrambling right like I'm putting it I'm just putting a giant vapour chamber and a giant
[762.24 → 768.32] heat sink on it and I'm otherwise going with a pretty traditional board design if I'm NVIDIA I go
[768.32 → 776.32] and I create this fancy pants special angular board and this like flow through design for my cooler that
[776.32 → 782.16] nobody can reasonably be expected to compete with until they've had another probably six months
[782.16 → 789.20] realistically like six to 12 months to come out and build something similar to and just like we've
[789.20 → 794.96] seen in previous generations with all the minds that go into this at NVIDIA's ad in board partners
[795.68 → 802.72] someone is going to create something that is super cool and totally unlike the reference or
[802.72 → 809.60] founders edition card but if they don't have the time to do it, it's not reasonable to expect them to
[809.60 → 816.24] be able to so at launch man the uh the founders editions honestly look pretty good this time around
[816.24 → 821.44] except that unfortunately with this announcement that nvidia.com will no longer be selling them
[821.44 → 827.84] comes the unfortunate news that Europeans or anyone outside the US who can't just walk into the best
[827.84 → 837.28] buy will simply not be able to buy them oh my god whoops I didn't think about that part whoops
[837.28 → 845.60] days um yeah digidude512 in float plane chat brings up another great reason why people like founders
[845.60 → 850.56] edition or reference cards and that's that generally they're the first to get water block support because
[850.56 → 857.04] of how common they are compared to say a strip or an Horus card with that said the situation is totally
[857.04 → 863.20] improving uh the first block we were able to get our hands on was actually an ek1 for an Asus strip RTX
[863.20 → 869.04] um that is for the 3090 uh actually I think yeah no it's compatible with the 3080 as well yeah so i
[869.04 → 873.12] think they use the same board design or at least DK thinks they do, and we did manage to put it on a 3090
[873.12 → 881.12] with some small modifications so uh it seems like uh yeah it seems like it's getting quite a bit better
[881.12 → 886.64] and so many of the board uh so many of the board makers actually do their own water blocks now like VGA
[886.64 → 894.00] does, or they have partnerships with brands like EK um that it's less of an issue today than it used to be
[895.92 → 901.92] so says but the founders edition cards are not reference cards this year yes that is true the
[901.92 → 907.60] founders edition cards are not reference cards to my knowledge there isn't really a reference card that
[907.60 → 916.56] anyone outside of you know maybe a board partner would have seen even yeah um all the RTX 3080
[916.56 → 921.76] and 3090s that I've seen from different manufacturers have been completely different boards
[925.52 → 929.68] uh unless I'm wrong unless there is a reference board that I'm not aware of, so guys feel
[929.68 → 934.40] free to let me know in the float plane chat I'm looking into it, i I haven't heard of anything and i
[934.40 → 939.12] don't see anything immediately but yeah in the meantime why don't we jump into the Microsoft
[939.12 → 945.60] GameStop deal that seems to be kind of like a kind of last-ditch effort to stay alive for
[945.60 → 951.44] GameStop I actually think this makes a ton of sense though so the original article here that
[951.44 → 958.80] we read through was on ours technical good article uh GameStop will now get a share in the lifetime
[958.80 → 965.92] digital sales revenue for any next-gen Xbox console sold through its stores, and it's not like there's no
[965.92 → 970.64] precedent for actually here hold on let's talk through the rest of the thing first, so this includes
[970.64 → 979.60] for full game downloads LCS microtransactions TV and movies and subscription plans now GameStop at
[979.60 → 985.28] the time of us making our notes here had yet to respond to a request for comment from ours technical
[985.28 → 991.92] and Microsoft declined a request to comment from ours technical and so that leaves everyone pretty much
[991.92 → 999.68] kind of guessing at what exactly is going on here um some analysts think that the size of the cut it
[999.68 → 1008.56] would be less than one percent um some are saying somewhere between one and ten percent um you know
[1008.56 → 1013.20] some are saying you know I don't believe that it would be a bigger cut because you know what's Microsoft's
[1013.20 → 1018.00] incentive here I don't see you know how you know what if they don't have this are they going to sell
[1018.00 → 1026.16] fewer boxes um but honestly i uh I think this makes a ton of sense and I think if I was Microsoft
[1026.16 → 1032.64] I would be super into a deal like this, although it does sound like PlayStation is potentially also
[1032.64 → 1037.68] having conversations about doing more or less the same thing which I'm sure they heard of this partway
[1037.68 → 1045.04] through the conversation, and we're just like well I guess we're doing that because you as dying as
[1045.04 → 1050.88] game stop is you can't just let your competitor have that type of deal because it would incentivize
[1050.88 → 1056.96] uh game stop to drastically push one console over the other so PlayStation is going to respond one
[1056.96 → 1062.88] quick thing I can just interject here is while the founders' edition is not on a reference card uh there
[1062.88 → 1071.20] is reference boards and the 3080 and 3090 share reference board designs as confirmed by EK water box oh okay
[1071.20 → 1081.12] I wasn't sure who is anyone was using them though yeah i not entirely sure but um sweet sounds like
[1081.12 → 1087.04] there is at least a reference board yeah maybe the more basic cards that makes sense thanks for that
[1087.04 → 1094.08] um all right so back to our notes for this one here um now there are some more obvious benefits
[1094.08 → 1099.04] for Microsoft that are part of the deal so GameStop will commit to use Microsoft's cloud products and
[1099.04 → 1105.84] tablets in their stores as they announced last week and um there's some sort of analysis here that
[1105.84 → 1111.84] could make Microsoft look better to shareholders with cloud revenue from GameStop I don't know what
[1111.84 → 1120.24] kind of shareholders think they GameStop using a surface tablet as an employee device like matters at all but
[1121.20 → 1128.80] sure whatever floats your boat um for me honestly I think this is quite a bit simpler than
[1128.80 → 1135.60] some of the other takes that I've seen so far I think this is just even if Microsoft knew
[1135.60 → 1141.84] that Sony was going to turn around and make the exact same deal making this pretty much status quo
[1141.84 → 1145.92] like on the one hand yeah like Microsoft they're going in there they're going to give a
[1145.92 → 1151.52] profit share to GameStop so that GameStop is going to push Xbox really hard people are going to come in
[1151.52 → 1155.76] try and buy a PlayStation 5 they're gonna they're going to hide them they're going to lock them away they're
[1155.76 → 1159.60] going to make them leave with an Xbox like at the end of the day most gamers already know what they're
[1159.60 → 1165.68] walking in for and at the end of the day there's no way that Sony wasn't going to counter a deal like
[1165.68 → 1174.00] this so if I'm Microsoft um i probably I'm already playing I'm already playing 4d chess with Sony at this
[1174.00 → 1180.48] point you know I'm so I'm looking two moves ahead 4d chess I already see that coming I know that my
[1180.48 → 1188.88] cloud infrastructure whatever is a huge benefit for me with project x cloud um a row just way more
[1188.88 → 1195.20] robust system for uh digital content delivery all that kind of stuff more digital sales so I'm
[1195.20 → 1201.20] expecting a ton of digital sales I know that ultimately this is all going to be like a war of
[1201.20 → 1207.04] attrition and I know that if we're both making the same deal with GameStop I'm in a better position to
[1207.04 → 1212.16] deliver on this promise in the longer term it's going to actually cost me less the other thing
[1212.16 → 1218.64] that if I'm Microsoft that I'm considering is like I don't actually want GameStop to go out of business
[1221.12 → 1228.00] think about that for a minute maybe I'm making this deal because I actually think it's a good thing
[1228.00 → 1236.16] for like how many stores does GameStop have like thousands maybe I think it's actually a good thing
[1236.72 → 1242.56] for remembering we're talking consoles as a service is the way that Mike's Microsoft is going here maybe
[1242.56 → 1248.80] I think it's a good thing to instead of going and trying to you know build a network of carrier stores
[1248.80 → 1255.92] like the mobile device industry has done whether you're T-Mobile or uh your Verizon or AT&T or whatever
[1255.92 → 1261.76] the case may be instead of doing that why don't I just basically take an infrastructure that already
[1261.76 → 1268.08] exists take a business model that we already know works where the store sells the hardware and then
[1268.08 → 1274.24] they get a recurring fee on any subscription revenue or any transactional revenue that so
[1274.24 → 1279.52] potentially this could be quite a generous fee and that keeps my distribution network alive
[1280.24 → 1286.64] not everyone is going to buy online not everyone there's even like there 's's even the value of
[1286.64 → 1292.80] like the classic story where you go to the go to the mall with your partner and they
[1292.80 → 1300.08] want to go buy whatever, and you're walking around bored, and you just go buy an Xbox game that's right
[1300.08 → 1307.68] every time that's right even if you don't buy something it's its in Microsoft's best interest
[1307.68 → 1315.04] for that store it's in Microsoft and Sony's best interest for that store to survive it's its basically
[1315.04 → 1322.72] a marketing exercise a game stop to me if I'm Microsoft a game stop is a free billboard yes actually
[1322.72 → 1326.80] it's like having your game on the shelf or having your console on the shelf or behind the
[1326.80 → 1333.92] desk or whatever is super valuable if I walk into a game stop, or it's uh EB games up here I'm usually
[1334.48 → 1340.32] not going to buy something but I'm going to look around and I'm gonna check like oh what new games
[1340.32 → 1345.44] came out for like for switch or something because I don't really stay on top of the news for that
[1345.44 → 1351.04] but a whole shelf of games in front of me is very in my face when I'm bored in the mall looking for
[1351.04 → 1355.52] something to do and I might as well look at some games I'll often just like look at the wall of games
[1355.52 → 1358.56] and then see anything that looks interesting and then google it while I'm standing there
[1359.12 → 1363.68] and see if there's any like more details so like they want these stores to survive so it's
[1363.68 → 1369.68] even if like it doesn't necessarily make a ton of financial sense in direct ROI yeah it's great
[1369.68 → 1376.96] marketing exactly and like to think about it if all Microsoft wanted to do was sell boxes at launch
[1376.96 → 1383.44] right well there's any number of partners you know there 's's your best buy or there's I mean
[1383.44 → 1389.12] it's screw if you know when demand is high for boxes you know you could sell they could sell
[1389.12 → 1395.52] boxes at corner stores, and they would move through them all but name someone other than
[1395.52 → 1402.32] GameStop who's not going to be focused on something else six months later Microsoft needs partners to
[1402.32 → 1409.92] still exist who are going to be pushing Xbox in five years or six years when the Xbox whatever
[1409.92 → 1418.00] completely bass backwards name they give it the next one is about to come out somebody when Skyrim
[1418.00 → 1424.40] definitive long-term reach platinum edition gets launched NVIDIA needs our NVIDIA Microsoft needs
[1424.40 → 1430.72] somebody to care about that and push the product so yeah so if I'm Microsoft I don't want GameStop to
[1430.72 → 1435.12] go away I think it's that simple and back to what you were saying about GameStop being a store that you
[1435.12 → 1440.88] would just kind of wander into at the mall I challenge you have uh I'm starting my timer
[1442.00 → 1448.00] oh boy in five seconds you have 30 seconds to name one other store in a mall that you would walk into go
[1453.76 → 1462.96] yeah I don't I don't know you got 20 more seconds go for it uh atmosphere okay all right so
[1462.96 → 1468.96] outdoor like a really long time to remember the name, but it has happened okay it has happened
[1468.96 → 1475.52] at least once but i I'm gonna start with game with uh EB games and then if I see everything and I'm like
[1475.52 → 1480.08] wow i it's just awkward that I'm still in this store I would wander around until I found atmosphere
[1481.04 → 1485.28] yep so you know what's funny I was actually at the mall with the wife we were trying to get some
[1485.28 → 1490.00] um she was helping me buy her a birthday present because I'm a pathetic terrible husband
[1492.48 → 1499.92] look she I knew she wanted clothes and there is no point buying a woman clothes without her just
[1499.92 → 1505.28] trying it on you did the right move so I wanted the kids to have something to give her
[1505.28 → 1510.88] we also did something homemade and thoughtful, and she told me she was very impressed with the bubble
[1510.88 → 1517.20] letters that I drew on the kids card for them to colour okay look bubble letters is not easy for me
[1517.20 → 1524.40] all right I did bubble letters she knew that was a stretch for me, she recognized the effort I think
[1524.40 → 1529.60] I remember this for some reason we had to do bubble letters back when we worked out of the old house
[1529.60 → 1534.72] and I remember there being like a whole thing about that yeah I had to do it or something because you and
[1534.72 → 1540.88] i both sucked bubble letters is not easy for me so anyway we did the homemade thing and i I put in
[1540.88 → 1546.64] the actual like effort but I wanted the kids to just have like a gift to give her along with the card and so
[1547.20 → 1554.72] uh for the first time ever I bought something at Lululemon which was interesting shorts are 60 Canadian
[1554.72 → 1561.84] dollars so that's a thing yeah that's like 45 us dollars that's uh she was like freaking out
[1561.84 → 1567.92] about it because she's like the i i i for the price of one of the got two pairs of shorts so it was
[1567.92 → 1574.32] like 130 after tax, and she was like for the price of one of these pairs of shorts I could completely
[1574.32 → 1579.92] replace like my entire bottom half like wardrobe at the price that I normally buy things at I'm like
[1579.92 → 1587.60] yeah but here's the thing Hun um we found something that fits in a store that was nearby, and we could
[1587.60 → 1595.36] either spend the next two hours walking around this mall or I could pay myself 60 an hour to go
[1595.36 → 1600.80] do something else and not still be shopping in this mall effectively, but anyway it's probably more
[1600.80 → 1606.72] comfortable, and it's a birthday thing and whatever the rest of that story is all right I don't know man
[1606.72 → 1613.28] the rest of that story is the one other store that I happened to walk into atmosphere hey because I was
[1613.28 → 1619.04] like oh this is kind of a cool looking store I didn't buy anything it's like whatever so we have
[1622.64 → 1623.20] that's great
[1625.92 → 1631.76] but I did walk into it, I did walk into it, we've got people like yeah I don't know I usually do like
[1631.76 → 1638.48] uh a like one kind of slow walk up and down every aisle is and then just leave but yeah
[1638.48 → 1650.56] uh all right cool so uh float plane chad oh why don't shop to Lululemon oh yeah i I don't I still
[1650.56 → 1655.92] for myself I still don't own a single Lululemon garment yeah probably not jams has been trying to
[1655.92 → 1659.84] get me to wear their clothes basically since the day he started he's like why do you dress like a
[1659.84 → 1666.16] homeless person like other than my LTT store stuff and I'm like well because LTT store hasn't made all of
[1666.16 → 1671.76] the products that I need to dress myself, yet we're going to have to just do joggers or something at some
[1671.76 → 1676.80] point so that I have pants to wear that are that I've actually i I think I have nothing to do with
[1676.80 → 1681.12] it so I don't know why people ask me so often but I think I've had more questions about when are you
[1681.12 → 1687.04] guys going to release some form of sweat pant than any other potential products I've had that
[1687.04 → 1692.32] question a lot, so part of the problem is that we have a lot of internal conflict over what type of
[1692.32 → 1697.36] pants to do jeans are basically going to be impossible for us as far as I can tell you need
[1697.36 → 1704.00] a team like yeah an enormous team of people to like figure out how to do jeans it is not simple
[1704.00 → 1709.84] it's a very difficult garment um so we're not doing that even though I'm a jeans wearer and I'd love it if
[1709.84 → 1718.48] we had like some really nice jeans um sweatpants were torn because nick and Lloyd want to do something
[1718.48 → 1724.40] that's more like a trendy sweat pant like a jogger type pant and I'm like no if we're going to do sweat
[1724.40 → 1728.80] pants let's do like some comfy sweatpants put like LTT across the bum you know what I'm talking about
[1728.80 → 1735.68] like nice that kind of sweatpants so basically as far as yeah as far as I can tell uh we have
[1735.68 → 1743.44] no sweatpants because Lloyd refuses to design mine and I refuse to green-light his so we're at an impasse
[1743.44 → 1751.84] I was thinking like uh the recent sweater non-hoodie thing yes just super similar to that
[1751.84 → 1759.04] like same colour similar material but with LTT on the butt just I was even thinking just like
[1759.04 → 1765.36] like same idea of the like tiny branding but yeah okay nope, nope big branding right across
[1765.36 → 1770.88] the butt that's that's what I want that's what I'm all that's what I'm all into here all right why
[1770.88 → 1777.92] don't we jump into our next topic um iPhone 12 apple released new iPhones the 12 12 mini 12 pro and
[1777.92 → 1784.72] 12 pro max wow that's a lot of iPhone all four variants will come with apple's new a14 bionic SOC
[1784.72 → 1789.28] as far as I can tell this is the first five nanometre chips that is commercially available
[1789.28 → 1796.88] it's got six CPU cores about 17 faster than a13 and four GPU cores that are about 20 faster than a13
[1796.88 → 1801.12] so it should be the fastest phone on the market pretty much by a country mile not that
[1801.68 → 1807.28] honestly makes much of a difference to me these days um other than my review of the new z fold 2
[1807.28 → 1812.48] I guess it's like new is hat this point i got it really late and I wanted it to be like uh like a
[1812.48 → 1819.60] really daily driving it reviews um so it's going to be even later so other than reviewing that which i
[1819.60 → 1825.36] don't think I'm going to be able to daily drive because YouTube stories is still not fixed with it and
[1825.36 → 1829.52] there's like other bugs like every time I try and post to Instagram at double posts and stuff like
[1829.52 → 1834.96] that um yeah so if not for that I'm still daily driving a note 9 which is like two-year-old phone
[1835.92 → 1842.64] has a 16 I'm still running a pixel 2xl heck yeah and yeah the pixel line is particularly
[1842.64 → 1846.72] interesting because they have not only peaked in terms of performance they're actually headed back
[1846.72 → 1852.96] down with the latest pixel 5. yeah I know you asked me a week or two ago and I'm I'm pretty
[1852.96 → 1858.80] I'm pretty solid on 4a 5g I need a new phone because my phone is like having notable issues
[1858.80 → 1863.20] like the proximity sensor and stuff I like I can't even have my sim in that phone anymore
[1863.20 → 1867.52] because I can't do phone calls but um but phone calls on a phone
[1868.96 → 1878.00] surely you mean playing raid shadow legends on a phone read shadow legions um so blah blah blah neural
[1878.00 → 1883.20] engine process 11 trillion operations per second all of them are 5g compatible with millimetre wave
[1883.20 → 1889.28] supported in the US and then sub 6 gigahertz globally has smart switching to save on battery
[1889.28 → 1897.76] life and MagSafe is back that's pretty cool sort of I guess i I like MagSafe yeah it's like a thing so
[1897.76 → 1902.24] here's something I find a little bit confusing about it do they really want me to put my phone like
[1902.24 → 1909.68] screen down on things because I don't like that I think they do because don't they have some usability
[1909.68 → 1917.04] features like screen down silences it or something um I mean that kind of stuff has existed for a long
[1917.04 → 1921.76] long time like I remember getting a briefing on like the galaxy s4 or something like that that had
[1921.76 → 1927.84] oh no yeah I'm just saying like I think they do intend for you to have it faced uh screened
[1927.84 → 1933.04] down so I've just never given any f's about that because why on earth would you do that that is the
[1933.04 → 1942.24] fastest easiest way to scratch the heck out of your phone screen for no reason like just don't all it
[1942.24 → 1950.08] takes is one like micro grain of something and some idiot to like to walk past and bump your phone and it to
[1951.20 → 1957.76] stretch across it, and you've got like a gouge out of your screen like that's really dumb um so yeah
[1957.76 → 1962.24] it allows for perfect charge coil alignment which is pretty cool i I haven't played around with it
[1962.24 → 1965.36] yet maybe I'm going to play around with it and I'm going to be like this is so cool because the
[1965.36 → 1971.52] magnets are like hello strong, and you'll be able to buy like desk mounted pads, and you just like
[1971.52 → 1977.20] basically kind of chuck the phone towards it, and it's like you know that it's like, and it like lines
[1977.20 → 1983.36] up perfectly that'd be pretty cool like mag safe that would cause other issues perfect mating you know
[1983.36 → 1990.08] like mag safe condom magnets to get everything aligned you know you have a keyboard with like a
[1990.08 → 1994.88] a real nice plate in it and your keyboard just like slowly travels across your desk over time
[1995.52 → 2001.04] yeah probably not happening um the pro and the pro max have lidar sensors built into the camera array
[2001.04 → 2005.76] so that you can get better autofocus and dim conditions so that's pretty cool and for augmented
[2005.76 → 2012.72] reality oh speaking of augmented reality I will stop just doing my you know obligation of going through
[2012.72 → 2017.60] the iPhone 12 launch information and I will talk about something actually exciting I got the new
[2017.60 → 2026.16] Mario Kart today oh nice and because I'm never one to do it halfway uh well actually sometimes
[2026.16 → 2032.32] we do it halfway it's called short circuit um so we were debating jams and I were going back and
[2032.32 → 2037.84] forth for probably like five minutes which channel does this thing go on if we were just going to unbox
[2037.84 → 2044.64] the one Nintendo sent us and just like kind of try it for two minutes then short circuit if we were
[2044.64 → 2051.20] going to like if we were going to like I don't know run it through a car wash or something and see which one
[2051.20 → 2058.32] is the last one to outright die you know then it's channel super fun right sure if we were going to try to
[2058.32 → 2064.64] you know stretch the limits of the technology and spend a bunch of time on it and like you know get four
[2064.64 → 2071.60] of them and do like a like an epic head-to-head race then it's still not really a LTT, but boy is
[2071.60 → 2078.24] that a lot of work yeahs so we decided to do a LTT anyway even though it's like kind of off-topic for us
[2078.80 → 2085.76] and I've got a pretty epic prize that is going to make this video worth watching I think so jams is
[2085.76 → 2092.48] going to work on the technical details of like you know making sure that there's an educational factor
[2092.48 → 2097.12] and I mean Nintendo's such a closed book I don't know how much or how little they're even
[2097.12 → 2104.00] going to share with us about you know how they got the latency so low or whatever right they might just
[2104.00 → 2112.08] be like the secret Japanese engineering don't worry about it um so that's possible, but we'll
[2112.08 → 2118.08] we'll get you guys whatever we can and then the tournament is going to be, or we're going to do a
[2118.08 → 2123.84] grand prix obviously so we'll do a grand prix and I'll be racing against a few people who volunteered
[2123.84 → 2129.52] for the video today um and the winner is going to get three days vacation
[2131.92 → 2140.16] the runner-up will get one day vacation so with the stakes so high oh and if I win I don't I do not
[2140.16 → 2147.76] give out any vacation, so even the runner-up doesn't get anything either uh the runner-up would get one
[2147.76 → 2154.16] yeah okay so someone will get something just go full i I love this because I'm not part of
[2154.16 → 2159.84] it so I can just say junk like this and everyone's going to hate me including my bird uh, but you just go
[2159.84 → 2166.00] full evil overlord and if you win just no one gets anything you're like you're the Bowser of the race
[2166.00 → 2175.84] so uh yeah that's going to be a lot of fun I'm really excited for it um spotty on float plane asks paid
[2175.84 → 2182.16] vacation it's not vacation if you're not paid that's just that's just calling in sick I don't know like
[2182.88 → 2189.84] yeah uh so yeah it should be really fun um, so everyone was allowed to take home their copy of
[2189.84 → 2195.20] the game we got four of them everyone was allowed to take it home for the weekend so you can bet that I will
[2195.20 → 2203.36] be practicing why don't you guys do multichannel like you, you could do a quick unboxing and look
[2204.00 → 2209.36] on short circuit you could do something on channel super fun where like there's like two teams or
[2209.36 → 2216.00] something, and you have like three hours, and you have to try to mod the the the racer to make it go
[2216.00 → 2220.96] faster or something and then have a drag race so that it's like not an as much of a time investment then
[2220.96 → 2226.40] you can have the big content on LTT like you don't have to it doesn't have to be one thing that's
[2226.40 → 2230.48] true we probably wouldn't do the channel super fun because we've got some kind of big ideas for that
[2230.48 → 2234.88] but you're probably right we probably should just do a short circuit unboxing and then follow it up with
[2234.88 → 2240.72] the Mario one see if we can kind of like build some momentum you know like hey come see this over on
[2240.72 → 2245.60] LTT make sure you don't miss it because by the way in a week or something we'll have a deeper dive
[2245.60 → 2249.28] coming on the main channel like that i I think that would be cool and I would probably just watch
[2249.28 → 2256.16] both that's a pretty good idea um we should probably talk about our sponsors for the show today
[2257.84 → 2262.72] kind of got ahead of ourselves there a little bit hey, so the show is brought to you today ladies and
[2262.72 → 2272.00] gentlemen by uh what is this uh oh what oh okay PCB way apparently we don't have a link to put in our

[2400.80 → 2404.32] what I'm just I'm fooling around what do you want from me
[2406.16 → 2413.36] why don't you tell us about the AMD motherboard with a soldered on a990 what is this thing this is
[2413.36 → 2416.16] weird i apparently it showed up on I think it was Alibaba
[2418.56 → 2427.04] okay um and i as far as I know it is supposed to be the Xbox One SOC which is weird um
[2427.92 → 2435.44] I don't know why you would really want this so much anymore like an Xbox One S like not a series s
[2435.44 → 2442.48] yeah not a series s so what Microsoft just like a bunch of these chips fell off the back of a truck
[2442.48 → 2451.20] and so you can like I don't even understand what I'm looking at here like because the Xbox One S and
[2451.20 → 2460.24] one x use DDR memory so does this chip that would have been custom-built for those consoles does this
[2460.24 → 2469.28] chip also support regular what looks like ddr4 sorry I can't actually tell immediately from the notch here
[2469.28 → 2476.40] quite surprising uh okay so sorry walk us through what else is going on here dr3
[2482.64 → 2487.76] loop dead it's weird it's weird i i I know I thought I had said something just a second ago but
[2487.76 → 2494.24] um it's i I don't I don't get not only why it exists but why you would really want it
[2494.24 → 2498.64] okay so what is it though
[2502.80 → 2512.72] seems to be what eight jaguar cores then um with an AMD r7 350 GPU
[2512.72 → 2525.04] okay um maybe it's intended for like i i i I don't know I'm really I'm really struggling here
[2525.04 → 2531.36] because uh you're I think you're muted or something lute I'm trying to get my bird to go away I'm sorry
[2532.00 → 2538.80] no worries do you want me to just talk through this one no you're good you're good i it's its weird i
[2538.80 → 2543.20] I think the ultimate answer is like people don't really know um because there 's's debate about
[2543.20 → 2549.52] what it is there's some theory that it could be the SOC but uh the ram thing is weird like why
[2549.52 → 2556.32] would it exist in this configuration like maybe this is the board that they used in the um uh what
[2556.32 → 2560.32] are those the like dev boxes that people get before the console comes out
[2561.12 → 2566.24] um like maybe this is the board they were using in that for some reason uh that that could explain the
[2566.24 → 2570.24] ram thing like maybe this is just a really early version, and they hadn't they hadn't fully converted
[2570.24 → 2577.52] over yet I don't know but um yeah unless some official information comes out and is like yes this is
[2577.52 → 2583.52] definitely that I could see some people wanting to like to collect it for that reason but outside that
[2583.52 → 2592.80] like i I don't why would you want this yeah um there's this chewy arrow box mini pc
[2592.80 → 2600.08] that uses a very similar motherboard to the Xbox One S um so you know that's an example of what
[2600.08 → 2606.00] someone might do with a product like this like maybe they would try to your know build like a weird
[2606.00 → 2614.16] knock off console or something I mean given how bad AMD's jaguar cores are by modern standards
[2614.16 → 2622.16] i I would not expect performance to be very good at all but um like there's there are comments on this
[2622.16 → 2628.00] article of the chewy arrow box like one of the first comments is given how god awfully the jaguar
[2628.00 → 2635.84] based am1 chips aged I'd avoid this like the plague with that said I think that's fairly well said with
[2635.84 → 2644.32] that said it's 125 us dollars for a motherboard CPU and GPU I mean the CP and GPU ain't anything special
[2644.32 → 2651.28] but you always got to look at things within the context of what else you can get for that price and
[2651.28 → 2656.72] you're looking at some pretty aging hardware for like that's it man you got to get one you got to
[2656.72 → 2663.84] do a build with it oh, oh we've already got this on order 100 100 like we're we're going to try it I bet
[2663.84 → 2673.92] the power consumption is just like terrible yeah i I don't I yeah I don't i would just go used
[2673.92 → 2679.20] at that point like if I was trying to build a cheap computer I would just go used and probably
[2679.20 → 2687.52] get better stuff anyway um do you guys want to hear an uh a really weird conspiracy theory that
[2687.52 → 2692.96] i kind of feel like I shouldn't even talk about because I'm pretty sure it's nonsense uh let's have
[2692.96 → 2699.52] a look here though so this is posted by spartaman64 on the forum a Redditor claimed NVIDIA's Russia
[2699.52 → 2708.88] branch cancelled the 30 series launch and scalped the GPUs instead um according to the post the Russian
[2708.88 → 2714.56] NVIDIA store like many others around the world sold out entirely within moments of going live except it
[2714.56 → 2720.72] wasn't actually sold the launch was allegedly cancelled before any cards were sold with um this user
[2721.44 → 2728.00] uh okay, so this is over on nvidia.com being told that it was due to production failures with an
[2728.00 → 2734.40] indefinite weight let's go ahead and pull this up here yep there you go tech mob I think all the
[2734.40 → 2741.12] Russian customers need an official explanation right now okay what else is going on here according
[2741.12 → 2745.68] to photos on Russian social media the address the cards were shipped to match the address of NVIDIA's
[2745.68 → 2752.08] Russian distributor d house on launch day uh this combined with inappropriate call-outs and bragging on
[2752.08 → 2756.48] social media has led the claims that NVIDIA's Russian arm or their distributors cancelled the launch in
[2756.48 → 2761.28] order to provide influential or simply high paying customers with the cards at the expense of every day
[2761.28 → 2768.64] customers in Russia there's a lot of he said she said going on here and NVIDIA's official response is
[2768.64 → 2774.56] and this is machine translated from Russian to English friends at the moment in Russia as in the rest of
[2774.56 → 2779.92] the world the demand for GeForce RTX 30 products significantly exceeds the available volume of goods
[2780.56 → 2785.52] I'll stop that now NVIDIA's online stores worldwide operate in reduced functionality mode, and we're working
[2785.52 → 2789.36] with partners to improve product availability in the coming weeks we will share all the necessary
[2789.36 → 2794.16] information in our community stay tuned for updates thank you for your patience and understanding
[2795.68 → 2797.76] okay um
[2800.40 → 2805.68] hmm the thread and threads like it look like they've been subject to vote manipulation via bots, so this is
[2805.68 → 2812.32] this is a proper mess whether this actually happened is uh definitely remains to be seen and
[2812.32 → 2820.48] it's possible we will never actually find out exactly what went down unless it's proven true i I think if
[2820.48 → 2827.92] if is it's not proven true it'll always just be this like weird thing that was I don't I don't suspect it
[2827.92 → 2836.48] will be proven false in other big news uh OnePlus co-founder carl pay has left the company uh the statement
[2836.48 → 2842.24] said after nearly seven years at OnePlus I've made the difficult decision to say goodbye pay who co-founded
[2842.24 → 2848.16] OnePlus in late 2013 with Pete LAU has been the public face of the company since its launch and played
[2848.16 → 2853.04] an instrumental role in designing the OnePlus smartphone lineup over the years and also uh how
[2853.04 → 2858.40] the company marketed itself android central speculated earlier this week that pay was leaving the firm
[2858.40 → 2864.64] because of an alleged internal power struggle between him and LAU so LAU took an additional role as
[2864.64 → 2872.08] senior vice president at opp BBK group owns opp realm OnePlus and vivo and OnePlus has always
[2872.08 → 2877.60] avoided questions about its ownership structure they kind of uh branded themselves as like a scrappy
[2877.60 → 2882.72] underdog even though it like didn't make any sense because no scrappy underdog can make a phone at a
[2882.72 → 2889.04] reasonable price, and they like weren't for sure pay has said that he left the company because OnePlus has
[2889.04 → 2892.72] been his singular focus for the last seven years it says he's looking forward to taking some time off to
[2892.72 → 2899.68] decompress, and then he'll figure out what to do next um i actually uh kind of just my very limited
[2899.68 → 2906.56] experience with OnePlus i kind of wonder if there's some truth to android's uh central speculation because
[2907.12 → 2914.00] I actually dealt with carl almost exclusively as the face of the company up until I would say about
[2915.20 → 2921.28] one and a half two years ago and then all of a sudden there was like a big sort of thing about
[2921.28 → 2927.68] uh Pete LAU doing his first keynote in English and then he all of a sudden it went from carl being
[2927.68 → 2932.32] the only one who was at events to Pete was the only one at events and then now carl's gone it's like
[2932.32 → 2940.48] yeah okay sounds about right um but given that they've never really been very transparent about their
[2940.48 → 2945.28] their management and their ownership structure I don't think we'll ever get a better idea of what exactly
[2945.28 → 2948.88] the way that's going to be the only one at the end of the day that's going to be the only one of the
[2948.88 → 2950.56] the other things that are going to be the only one that's going to be the only one that's going to be
[2950.56 → 2953.60] that sounds credible enough to me though
[2956.96 → 2961.44] anything else you really wanted to get to this week there is one thing that I would really like to
[2961.44 → 2968.32] get to this week um not only am I interested but I feel like if I didn't bring this up um
[2968.32 → 2975.84] then the line inspective flow plane users would disown me um the applied at Amazon story
[2975.84 → 2982.96] oh I'm sorry okay I will get to that in a moment first I have to give an update on the drive savers
[2983.60 → 2993.60] um drama okay yep yeah so i i do have to do that so last week basically what I said was hey look
[2993.60 → 3001.04] I haven't talked to Jesse who claimed that drive savers took credit for her innovative workaround
[3001.04 → 3008.88] with an apple speaker I see that allowed a frozen phone to be temporarily booted all the data to be
[3008.88 → 3015.20] recovered and then restored to functionality through a reset she claimed that drive savers took credit in
[3015.20 → 3021.52] our sponsored video for her solution to that problem and I basically said okay so I'm finding out about
[3021.52 → 3029.28] this now I haven't spoken with Jesse um but obviously that's a pretty serious allegation uh
[3029.28 → 3037.12] here's what she said here's what drive savers said um you know right now it's he said she said so i
[3037.12 → 3044.40] can't really take a position here um what I did do in the week since the last one show is reach
[3044.40 → 3050.24] out to Jesse she actually posted on our forum and I basically said like hey look um
[3050.24 → 3057.60] um these yeah these are pretty serious allegations and um it looks like you've got a
[3057.60 → 3064.08] pretty compelling story here but what I need in order to take real action on this is some kind of
[3064.08 → 3072.96] proof um that what you say is true and what they say is not so what she's done is she's created a video
[3072.96 → 3079.76] about sort of the points um of drive savers position on this that she disagrees with she's
[3079.76 → 3084.56] also created a post on the forum which we're going to have linked at the bottom of the video uh sorry
[3084.56 → 3089.36] unfortunately I don't have it there now so I'm going to add it right now and I'm going to see if
[3089.36 → 3093.84] that actually updates I'm going to have it right above where the time stamps are going to be there you
[3093.84 → 3099.68] go I've got that on YouTube and oh no I don't have an easy way to update it on float plane right now but
[3099.68 → 3103.52] I'll add it later I'll add it later no I won't because there's no anchor archive doesn't matter
[3103.52 → 3108.64] the point is uh there's a link on YouTube to her post over on the forum where basically
[3109.84 → 3117.68] in a nutshell I don't have any there's no smoking gun but I would say that there is a lot of
[3117.68 → 3126.16] circumstantial evidence if you kind of get what I mean so there's no there's no silver bullet there's
[3126.16 → 3132.48] no like hey this is the text message that they sent to me admitting that they stole my technique
[3133.20 → 3140.88] but there's a lot of uh there are a lot of claims that drive savers has made that don't seem to quite
[3140.88 → 3146.56] add up with respect to their in-house capabilities compared to the capabilities of third-party
[3146.56 → 3152.88] contractors that they use and it just kind of leads us to believe that um
[3152.88 → 3159.92] um you know there may be something to Jesse's story so as for what I'm going to do
[3160.40 → 3167.68] um so far we haven't heard from drive savers with any definitive proof one way or the other and we
[3167.68 → 3173.12] haven't heard from Jesse with any definitive proof one way or the other so what we're going to do is
[3173.12 → 3179.36] we're going to leave the video up, but we're going to do something that we are able to do under extremely
[3179.36 → 3188.40] um uh sort of exceptional circumstances, and we are going to uh replace the video that is there
[3188.40 → 3193.36] with one that has an edit in it during the time when I'm talking about this technique that basically
[3193.36 → 3199.52] has text at the bottom that says Jesse Jones uh from I have iPad rehab says that this is actually her
[3199.52 → 3204.00] technique, and we're going to have a link in the video description to where you can read through
[3204.00 → 3211.60] um you know her statement about you know why uh why you should believe her side of the story and then
[3211.60 → 3218.32] what we're going to do moving forward is honestly I just can't deal with this kind of uh he said she
[3218.32 → 3227.44] said nonsense um my life is a drama free zone so if I can't um if I can't operate under an assumption that
[3227.44 → 3231.84] sponsors and members of the community are all able to be straight with me
[3231.84 → 3237.60] uh then we're just not going to work with any data recovery companies moving forward at all
[3238.16 → 3244.72] um you know i just I have no way of validating who's telling yeah I have no way of validating
[3245.60 → 3251.52] just a hundred percent unequivocally who is telling me the truth and this is one of those things that i
[3251.52 → 3258.16] just cannot afford to have our company dragged through the mud over because someone is being disingenuous so
[3258.16 → 3266.32] that's um that's my commitment I've already told that to Jesse and um I've asked um I've asked the
[3266.32 → 3271.52] business team to pass that along to drive savers um I've already I told Jesse actually that I might
[3271.52 → 3277.04] make one exception for that um or two exceptions I guess I told her that I would be open to doing a
[3277.04 → 3284.88] collab so not promoting her business or drive or device recovery you know or anything like that but
[3284.88 → 3290.00] just YouTuber to YouTuber I'd love to do a collab like maybe just fixing something together um kind
[3290.00 → 3295.68] of like what we did with lewis Grossman in the past and then if deep spar ever came back to us and wanted
[3295.68 → 3300.48] to do another video I think we would work with deep spar again just because there was zero
[3300.48 → 3308.32] drama um they're fantastic they're so cool um I love what they do um and the feedback from our
[3308.32 → 3313.60] community was overwhelmingly positive for the tool that we were promoting last time we worked with them
[3313.60 → 3323.28] uh it was a tool that basically used like um a cloud connection where because you can only like you can
[3323.28 → 3328.72] only test the characteristics of so many failing hard drives a hard drive has to fail in order for you to
[3329.36 → 3335.84] uh in order for you to perform analytics on it, and you know observe its behaviour so what deep spar built was
[3335.84 → 3344.00] this tool that uh you can use to take like uh, uh like to record the characteristics of the failing
[3344.00 → 3348.64] drive that you have or the failed drive that you have and compare it to other drives that were failing
[3348.64 → 3354.48] or failed and help you determine what the problem is, and then it would add that data to their collective
[3354.48 → 3361.20] data on their servers so that other people could benefit from it making it like kind of an an a tool that
[3361.20 → 3365.76] gets better and better the more people in the data recovery community use if it was like super cool
[3365.76 → 3370.32] idea, and apparently it ended up selling really well our feedback from our community was perfect so
[3370.32 → 3374.56] we would work with them again but beyond that we're just we're just not going to do it anymore I don't
[3374.56 → 3381.36] need that drama in my life it feels almost like uh I don't even remember their names but those two
[3381.36 → 3386.96] brothers that just like make fake drama on YouTube constantly oh yeah I'm not going to say their names I heard
[3386.96 → 3392.00] if you say that in too much they appear they have three times in the mirror that way that the
[3392.00 → 3397.20] other thing too is that as long as I don't mention any names then uh I have plausible deniability for
[3397.20 → 3405.44] it being any two brothers so yeah two brothers and there are grandmas, and they fight them and there's a
[3406.00 → 3411.60] meteor coming towards the earth two brothers yeah it should be it should be fine
[3411.60 → 3418.96] YouTuber drama is probably much more interesting to YouTubers than to Ltd viewers uh says last digit of
[3418.96 → 3429.36] pi yeah yeah probably yep um no it is not like the old annotations so we would have to it's a whole it's
[3429.36 → 3436.16] a whole thing uh wait what why is Ltd's name ruined what are you guys even talking about in float plane chat
[3436.16 → 3442.00] i think we're okay I think we're uh i I think we're I think we're pretty good I think we're
[3442.00 → 3447.76] pretty good on uh on that all right well I think that's pretty much it other than I should probably
[3447.76 → 3452.32] have a look at a couple of super chats I saw a couple of big ones come in I need to make sure i
[3452.32 → 3457.92] at least hit those all baker says many Wang shows ago Linus asked whether he should play Final Fantasy
[3457.92 → 3462.80] six with a mod which both fixes bug and ups the difficulty oh yeah I played through about half the game
[3462.80 → 3469.68] um it was okay it was different um yeah it was all right wait are you starting super chats yeah no
[3470.80 → 3478.00] what why I supplied at Amazon Linus applied at Amazon right at Amazon okay all right all right
[3478.00 → 3485.12] all right oh okay all right all right all right so back when I had already decided
[3485.12 → 3491.68] to leave NCI but I hadn't actually I think the way the timeline goes is that I hadn't actually told
[3491.68 → 3497.60] them that I was going to be leaving yet um I wanted to explore my options so that I would have some
[3497.60 → 3504.96] idea of how strong my negotiating position was going to be because my plan I had already sought legal
[3504.96 → 3512.40] advice to determine whether the Linus tech tips channel could be argued belonged to me um I was
[3512.40 → 3519.60] going to make the argument that it's in my name and therefore was treated um at NCI as sort of
[3519.60 → 3524.72] personal project I was going to make the argument that I did a lot of the work on it on my own time
[3525.36 → 3533.52] I informed the lawyer that i uh was compensated for that time but not at like an above minimum wage
[3533.52 → 3542.64] rate necessarily um because the amount that I was compensated for per video was like I think accounted
[3542.64 → 3547.84] for like maybe an hour and change of time but a lot of the videos took much, much longer than that
[3547.84 → 3553.84] plus if it wasn't significantly better than mine than it then it wasn't very good yeah so
[3555.36 → 3560.80] um basically I gave a lawyer all this information they went no I think with all that in mind it's
[3560.80 → 3566.56] the intellectual property of NCI you have no real claim to make here and I was like okay that's
[3566.56 → 3574.16] fair, and it was worth finding out um so what I had decided was I wanted it and I needed to figure out a way to
[3574.16 → 3582.88] uh what chips I could offer in return and I thought that if it was as simple as
[3583.68 → 3591.20] okay well you can either give it to me or I can go work for your competitor um they would give it to me
[3592.00 → 3599.12] and the way that I saw it because you know one of my ideas for uh surviving back then was that NCI should
[3599.12 → 3605.68] um revise their business model to be more like actually very similar to what Amazon does with
[3605.68 → 3610.88] their with their drop points now or I forget what they're branded where you just like have something
[3610.88 → 3616.80] shipped to like a drop box, and you just go pick it up yeah, yeah local pickups um I wanted NCI to shift
[3616.80 → 3621.12] to a model where we had like these little tiny hole in the wall stores that were basically not a
[3621.12 → 3625.84] storefront at all like we could have a service section if we wanted to because that's fairly lucrative
[3625.84 → 3631.60] even in a small town and then just kind of like a small warehouse in the back, and then we would only
[3631.60 → 3636.56] stock like the two most popular items from each category so if someone really did want to come in
[3636.56 → 3640.56] and configure a custom computer then you could configure a custom computer as long as it used
[3641.20 → 3647.76] Kingston ram in this speed and one of two capacities and like you know what I mean like it's like
[3647.76 → 3652.32] probably mostly just beneficial to the service centre so that they have something to like to throw in
[3652.32 → 3656.88] when they pretty much and then other than that we would just have trucks that went back and forth
[3656.88 → 3663.04] across the country so that every you know two to three days um one of the one of the big warehouses
[3663.04 → 3667.92] would have a transfer going out to each one and people across the country would be able to get items
[3669.44 → 3673.52] in just like a couple of days without paying for shipping because it would be we would just kind
[3673.52 → 3677.92] of absorb that as part of our cost of doing business apparently they're called Amazon lockers so
[3677.92 → 3683.36] anyway that was one of my ideas um NCI didn't really seem to see Amazon as the big threat which
[3683.36 → 3689.84] is hilarious to me now because Amazon is a monster in pc hardware even though their site is horrendous for
[3689.84 → 3697.28] finding it and um so I thought that one of the things that I could do to strengthen my negotiating position
[3698.16 → 3704.16] and or just make sure that I was able to make money after I was no longer working at NCI if they
[3704.16 → 3708.96] didn't ultimately give me the channel because I was going to leave no matter what was uh to try to
[3708.96 → 3713.52] get a job at Amazon and I knew from talking to people who had applied there that getting a job
[3713.52 → 3720.96] there was like notoriously difficult um there's like this whole long interview process, and it's like a
[3720.96 → 3726.56] bunch of interviews and like they won't even look at you if you don't have certain credentials and so
[3727.28 → 3733.60] I did find a job that I thought was right up my alley, and it was like a social media coordinator and I was
[3733.60 → 3740.16] like oh wow yeah I mean I don't have the bachelor's degree that they say they want, but boy do i ever
[3740.16 → 3745.92] have a fair bit of experience in social media which remember guys this was eight years ago this was
[3745.92 → 3753.04] before you know every boomer and their dog had you know uh a weird throwaway Instagram account where
[3753.04 → 3758.80] they repost memes with like you know a hundred thousand followers or whatever um having social media
[3758.80 → 3767.84] like like like proven social media success was kind of a big deal, and so i had uh my twitter
[3767.84 → 3776.48] account I had uh these two YouTube channels that had significant followings and I applied and um
[3778.24 → 3786.72] I mean that's kind of the end of the story Amazon had an opportunity to hire me and did not even reply to
[3786.72 → 3794.00] my application presumably because I didn't have the right credentials even though if they knew what
[3794.00 → 3799.44] the right credentials were for a social media coordinator they would have recognized them on
[3799.44 → 3808.56] my resume in fact if you look at my LinkedIn uh LinkedIn I don't remember all the conversations from back
[3808.56 → 3817.20] then there was a lot um if you didn't get the channel what would you have done would you have
[3817.20 → 3824.80] started a new channel right so ultimately what i had what I told NCI was that I would go to
[3824.80 → 3831.12] memory express who I did have an offer from um or I would go move down south and I would go work at
[3831.12 → 3839.60] new egg and new egg and memory express for um just sort of like emotional reasons I think were a lot
[3839.60 → 3844.00] more effective anyway like I don't think they would have understood that Amazon was the threat that it was
[3844.64 → 3849.52] yeah uh and so ultimately we did get the channel as for what I would have done if we didn't get the
[3849.52 → 3856.88] channel oh man um I would have been okay uh WD offered me a job a little while after with the team
[3856.88 → 3862.48] that I think ended up getting dissolved so I don't know how long that would have lasted but as for you
[3862.48 → 3867.36] guys I don't know I don't know what the heck you and ed would have done yeah ed and I were kind of
[3867.36 → 3873.12] like suicide-packed on that plan at that point I think what we would have had to do is start the
[3873.12 → 3880.00] channel fresh, and we would have just had to eat a lot more macaroni and cheese honestly I don't
[3880.00 → 3886.48] necessarily think it would have been that bad the first man we had 200 000 subscribers when we started
[3886.88 → 3892.64] and 200 000 subscribers back then was a lot more than it is now and I guess you probably wouldn't
[3892.64 → 3896.88] have been able to get away with like posting a video saying that you were going somewhere else but
[3896.88 → 3902.80] i just I think a lot of people would have followed is all I'm I'm really saying um like even back then
[3902.80 → 3908.40] like the community was so much smaller and so much more tight-knit like you'd see the same people
[3908.40 → 3913.68] commenting on videos across the board because we just really honestly didn't get that many views back
[3913.68 → 3918.96] then that's true, and the forum would have helped us with that but I think if I recall correctly when
[3918.96 → 3922.96] we started like it definitely would have been harder but yeah we wouldn't have had the domain
[3922.96 → 3927.60] even like we wouldn't have had infotech tips.com we'd have had to completely rebrand and remember
[3927.60 → 3935.04] to that YouTube's discoverability was not as good back than like nowadays we can start a new channel
[3935.04 → 3940.48] make a video and the fact that it has my face in the thumbnail all of a sudden instead of getting
[3940.48 → 3948.32] four views it's getting 40 000 views because the algorithm knows so it just wasn't that
[3948.32 → 3953.28] sophisticated back then I think it would have been really tough i I think it would have been doable i
[3953.28 → 3958.16] definitely i I agree with the like we'd be I don't remember exactly how you said it eating macaroni or
[3958.16 → 3962.00] eating crafting or whatever longer but I still think it would have been I still think it would have been
[3962.00 → 3968.96] possible um so if you guys want to see what my resume looked like that i sent to Amazon it's
[3968.96 → 3975.92] basically my LinkedIn profile the one thing that's new now is that I have founder Linus media group inc
[3976.80 → 3983.84] and I don't even know what that looks like I haven't seen mine in so long yeah, so this is great about
[3983.84 → 3989.20] I am a self-driven social media enthusiast with extensive experience and success on YouTube in the
[3989.20 → 3995.76] past seven years I have built multiple channels that now total 2 million subscribers and 200 million views
[3995.76 → 4006.40] wow Linus that is you know that that's very impressive good job young boy um actually inaccurate now
[4008.64 → 4009.12] rough
[4011.92 → 4017.20] i I saw someone posted a tweet the other day that ended up getting a lot of traction where they said they
[4017.20 → 4023.44] they updated their twitter bio before they updated their LinkedIn and that should say a lot about like
[4023.44 → 4028.24] what the current like uh like hiring and recruitment space looks like and I'm like
[4029.44 → 4034.32] you know yeah to be honest like I haven't heard the last time anyone cared about LinkedIn at all
[4034.32 → 4040.08] you know what I don't know because I get a lot of messages and stuff on LinkedIn from people that are
[4040.08 → 4044.00] like wow I had no idea how to get in touch with you and I like I'm trying to get in touch with you here
[4044.00 → 4047.52] and what do you have no idea to get in how to get in touch with me the email is literally on the about
[4047.52 → 4054.40] tab on the YouTube channel like what are you talking about um maybe feel huge with a certain
[4054.40 → 4063.20] demographic or something boomers yep because it was super popular around that time like that that would
[4063.20 → 4069.68] have been 2012 2013, and it was huge back then I mean people thought it was very, very professional
[4069.68 → 4076.72] it's a big business now though like yeah I don't know man oh man I love my I love my profile
[4076.72 → 4084.40] i I put like the least amount of effort possible into my Linus media group entry Linus media group
[4084.40 → 4089.60] is committed to what is this is committed to delivering fun engaging social media and video
[4089.60 → 4094.40] marketing solutions that's what I wrote seven years and ten months ago and I have never touched it again
[4096.88 → 4101.84] your NCI entries are like so long and well written out i I feel like I remember
[4101.84 → 4109.92] you and Von working on these uh no I did this uh I'm I'm going to be totally honest with you um
[4110.48 → 4116.16] I actually did this oh I must have contacted Amazon after I had to after I had told NCI I was leaving
[4116.16 → 4121.68] then because I remember working on this at work while I was just like checked out and had already told
[4121.68 → 4126.56] them that I was leaving, and my main job was just to like to be there and answer questions for my replacement
[4126.56 → 4133.12] so I didn't really have anything to do so that must be the order of operations scroll down look at your
[4133.12 → 4140.56] publication section publications yeah what are publications you have to get below education you
[4140.56 → 4146.64] have to get all the way down the three publications fast as possible Linus tech tips and NCI tech tips
[4146.64 → 4152.40] look at the descriptions too though fast informative videos about technology YouTube video blog sponsored
[4152.40 → 4158.64] by NCI developed and hosted by yours truly flagship YouTube channel for ncix.com developed
[4158.64 → 4167.76] administrated and hosted by me what a nerd why am I such a nerd so we both have just like flagrantly
[4167.76 → 4175.44] false information on our LinkedIn I love that I have one recommendation one single recommendation on
[4175.44 → 4181.12] LinkedIn from uh from Tarzan so for those of you who don't know who Tarzan is i I totally get it
[4181.12 → 4190.32] you know who is that guy uh so he works at uh he works as director of sales at corsair uh for North America
[4190.32 → 4199.36] and he was my uh so he was for the latter part of my NCI career he was like my boss, but then he was gone
[4199.36 → 4204.32] and that was one of the reasons that I ultimately decided to leave because he was sort of a voice of sanity
[4204.32 → 4210.96] in the chaos and the fact that he was gone I was like oh that this sucks um so yeah he was the one who
[4210.96 → 4215.60] was there for the roast and I had wanted him there not because his public speaking was amazing as far
[4215.60 → 4220.32] as I knew he did a great job though um I had wanted him there just because I wanted someone who knew me
[4220.32 → 4226.48] as a young professional and I use the term professional very loosely um his recommendation
[4226.48 → 4231.12] he wrote me on LinkedIn is very nice though it's more reflective of his later experience with me i
[4231.12 → 4237.92] suspect I remember him telling me at some point on like a business trip like you know you need to learn to just shut up sometimes
[4237.92 → 4242.80] some peace and quiet would be nice
[4246.40 → 4252.08] I don't know I was just I was just jazzed I was like we never hang out he's like yeah well why do you think
[4252.08 → 4257.12] that is now we do whenever we get a chance, but it's tough because he lives down in the states
[4257.84 → 4264.24] that's funny oh boy all right so let's do a couple more okay hopefully the story lived up to your
[4264.24 → 4270.80] expectations let's do a couple more super chats NPR says in a YouTube story you showed a 3090

[4327.60 → 4331.76] money buying my wife underwear she won't wear I might as well spend the money to support you guys
[4332.56 → 4339.84] okay so we have tentatively greenlet the project there's just there's so many people asking about it'll
[4339.84 → 4346.08] be a small production run, but we're going to put the work into it, we're going to do it pretty much guarantee
[4346.08 → 4353.12] you it's going to sell out immediately we're we're going to do it we're going to do it um as uh actually i
[4353.12 → 4359.28] think I might have convince divan to let me upload the vlog that we shot making that one-off pair that
[4359.28 → 4366.32] she has it's pretty funny because we like made a lot of mistakes and stuff like that so sorry
[4367.12 → 4370.72] floatplane exclusive I was actually going to put it on the Linus cat tips channel
[4370.72 → 4374.56] I could put it up early on the plane though that works because I was thinking like where else would
[4374.56 → 4380.72] you put that yeah yeah but maybe cat tips makes sense channel says about ways to support phone
[4380.72 → 4388.48] OS is longer uh 15 Fairphone 2 shipped with android 5.1 now has 7.1 despite no SOC support, and it has a
[4388.48 → 4394.40] beta for nine could mean support till 2022 to finance it the phone is super repairable spare equals
[4394.40 → 4401.04] revenue and a bit overpriced yeah that's a that's a fair way to attack that uh theories says not much
[4401.04 → 4408.00] to say hope you and all at leg are great oh and FP is still upset Luke did not talk like a pirate when
[4408.00 → 4413.36] the bird was perched on his shoulder last week next time r what do you think Luke are you going to do it
[4413.36 → 4419.28] are you gonna talk like a pirate I'm terrible at that kind of stuff um, and it would probably be super
[4419.28 → 4428.08] annoying um but I don't know maybe my morning I'm having the bird randomly come to visit me but i
[4428.08 → 4433.20] don't want it to like to take over the show my morning woo says my girlfriend finally gave me permission to
[4433.20 → 4438.64] build a new pc I'm waiting for the dozen 5900x and I'm going to pair it with a RTX 3080 you better get on
[4438.64 → 4447.68] that RTX 3080 give it a yeah good luck uh the daily Dan says can't you compromise on the pants and
[4447.68 → 4453.68] make regular pants that normal people will wear but include an iron-on LTT butt patch for people
[4453.68 → 4463.92] like Linus that's not a bad idea daily Dan that's not a bad idea um jerry says you know Amazon has
[4463.92 → 4468.80] expert installation on their electronics including computer hardware uh what if you unlike Lyle build
[4468.80 → 4473.76] an entire pc this way uh we had actually considered doing that I can't get down to the states right now
[4473.76 → 4479.84] and I don't think they offer the service in Canada so yes it is actually on our list of stuff to do it's
[4479.84 → 4485.20] just it's really hard to do it right now Alex the psychotherapist says I wanted to say I'm a huge fan
[4485.20 → 4488.88] I love your work I hope you keep up the good work what happened between you and marines it seems their
[4488.88 → 4495.60] whole company is going under so I don't know anything about that drama um marina's coffee
[4495.60 → 4505.52] going under I don't know what is this backup of about marina's coffee are they shop uh cold brew coffee
[4506.56 → 4514.08] can you okay as far as I can tell you can just like buy stuff uh I mean I could be wrong NCI's site was
[4514.08 → 4517.76] up and running, and you could like to buy stuff up until the very end uh
[4520.72 → 4527.44] I don't know I mean we didn't cut them off I'll say that much, but we clearly don't get sponsorship
[4527.44 → 4533.84] from them anymore so I guess they don't like us because we're bad people I don't know I don't know
[4533.84 → 4541.60] their twitter's still active like i I have no idea ninth praise says why did you buy the domain UFD
[4541.60 → 4547.60] store.com robbing UFD tech of their store seems a bit shady that you did that are you an idiot
[4550.80 → 4558.16] do you know UFD at all like there's Brett bought UFD store.com and redirected it to LTT store I didn't
[4558.16 → 4566.80] do that sheesh all right well I think that's it for today um

[4628.40 → 4638.80] that like that just happens and i the CEO have no freaking idea what's going on like this is why
[4638.80 → 4645.20] this is why I tend to be a little bit more forgiving you know when intel has some scandal where
[4645.20 → 4650.32] the marketing people say something that the engineers obviously wouldn't agree with um because
[4650.32 → 4656.16] I'm like yeah it's probably just someone doing something and like people who know better don't know
[4656.16 → 4663.04] about it um i I believe that that's a thing that could happen what a beautiful example oh my goodness
[4663.60 → 4666.96] oh man you and i both were like that's dumb
