[0.00 → 1.54] Gentlemen, to the WAN show.
[1.76 → 5.30] We've got a significantly better streaming setup this week.
[6.14 → 8.46] I can't promise it's going to be a great show, though.
[8.54 → 10.02] We just did three of these.
[10.84 → 15.76] And this is the final pre-recorded WAN show for this session.
[16.00 → 18.40] And even I'm tired at this point.
[19.08 → 23.74] I will say I have no major complaints anymore because I am home now.
[24.20 → 26.70] So there's no way for me to really go.
[27.46 → 28.10] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28.10 → 32.60] This whole quarantine thing is working out absolutely great for you.
[32.70 → 39.22] I am 100% certain that you are self-quarantined only 50% out of concern for the virus.
[41.12 → 45.44] The other 50% is definitely because you hated going out anywhere anyway.
[46.28 → 48.10] Yeah, I will say one thing.
[48.10 → 50.54] I'm actually quite sad because of the timing.
[51.08 → 54.90] Because I used to do this thing called sports day.
[54.90 → 60.06] And on a certain day of the week, myself and some friends would go to a field and just play random sports.
[60.28 → 62.78] And I was like really excited to get that going again.
[63.82 → 65.08] You've never invited me to that.
[65.14 → 65.74] Are we not friends?
[66.02 → 66.68] No, that's a no.
[66.92 → 68.00] I have, actually.
[68.00 → 68.60] Actually, you have.
[68.68 → 69.06] You have.
[69.14 → 70.10] I was never able to come.
[70.16 → 72.62] I had very young children at the time in my defence.
[72.88 → 73.20] In my defence.
[73.20 → 75.74] You might be able to now, but now we can't go outside.
[75.74 → 80.70] Yeah, I would be super jazzed to come to sports day now, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards.
[81.94 → 84.28] I'm hoping that we can get like one in this summer.
[84.38 → 84.80] But anyway.
[85.12 → 86.98] We've got a great show for you guys today.
[87.18 → 90.56] Intel's 10th gen mobile processors have been announced.
[90.56 → 94.04] And they actually look like they might give AMD a run for their money.
[94.04 → 106.96] If by give them a run for their money, we're talking raw performance as opposed to efficiency, which is typically one of the ways that we do, in fact, measure the performance of a mobile processor.
[108.02 → 114.30] In other news, Racer releases a new Blade 15 with a 300 hertz display.
[115.16 → 115.46] Ouch.
[116.80 → 117.42] Get it?
[117.60 → 119.38] 8,400 megahertz RAM.
[119.60 → 120.30] 300 hertz.
[121.12 → 121.46] Ouch.
[122.14 → 123.04] You know, ouch for everyone.
[123.04 → 124.18] One of those jokes in a while.
[124.26 → 127.90] But Racer and all the other people that are going to have 300 hertz displays.
[130.78 → 132.82] DDR5 mass production starts this year.
[133.24 → 133.88] That'll be interesting.
[134.10 → 135.04] Also, Samsung.
[135.14 → 136.22] That'll be interesting.
[136.40 → 136.52] Really?
[136.70 → 138.26] That's all the commentary you have on that.
[138.40 → 138.66] No, no.
[138.70 → 139.30] I want more.
[139.38 → 139.90] I want more.
[140.26 → 142.80] I know this is the intro, but you got to give me more than that.
[143.48 → 145.46] We won't see it for a while.
[147.46 → 150.20] And its impact on Intel's side probably won't be that high.
[151.14 → 151.66] All right.
[151.76 → 152.04] Cool.
[152.04 → 152.92] All right.
[152.96 → 154.40] You can tell me about the Samsung thing now.
[155.16 → 155.76] The Samsung thing?
[155.96 → 156.12] Yeah.
[156.24 → 159.52] Samsung to cease all LCD production in 2020.
[159.98 → 165.32] Samsung Display decided to end all of its production of LCD panels in South Korea and
[165.32 → 167.26] China by the end of this year.
[167.68 → 168.74] They announced on Tuesday.
[168.74 → 169.74] Wow.
[169.74 → 172.12] That is crazy.
[172.12 → 172.14] Crazy.
[172.14 → 173.72] That's huge, actually.
[173.72 → 174.04] Yeah.
[174.64 → 176.28] Why is that marked rumour?
[176.60 → 183.48] Because our source is like Reuters, which is generally not associated with rumour mongering.
[184.20 → 184.64] Okay.
[184.64 → 186.62] We're going to have to get a little bit of clarification on that one.
[186.74 → 192.10] Unfortunately, all the writers are contributing kind of their top stories to the doc these days.
[192.10 → 194.54] And whoever contributed that one didn't mark it.
[194.54 → 196.62] So we're just going to have to make some wild guesses.
[196.62 → 198.90] I'm going to guess James.
[199.54 → 201.80] And I'm going to guess that it's time to roll that intro.
[203.62 → 204.82] They can hear us, I think.
[206.76 → 208.50] I'm not sure if they can hear the intro.
[208.64 → 209.38] Wait, we did a test.
[209.46 → 210.16] Can they hear the intro?
[210.78 → 211.10] Music?
[211.10 → 214.40] Uh, yeah.
[214.72 → 215.54] Okay, cool.
[216.42 → 218.72] Is it super loud or is it okay this week?
[219.78 → 220.70] It was, oh.
[221.72 → 222.96] No one's screaming yet.
[223.08 → 223.64] Okay, cool.
[223.70 → 224.50] Well, that's a good sign.
[224.92 → 230.64] And the show is brought to you today by Back blaze and private internet access.
[231.36 → 231.64] Woo!
[233.38 → 236.34] I didn't see any of those come up on screen, if you did.
[236.34 → 242.14] No, they didn't because I didn't copy the lower third versions of the sponsor pictures.
[242.98 → 244.62] So they weren't there, but I said them.
[244.68 → 248.38] I said them verbally, and I'm pretty sure they still have to pay us if I do that.
[248.50 → 248.78] Nice.
[248.86 → 249.60] So it should be fine.
[249.60 → 250.32] I mean, that's the goal.
[250.48 → 251.54] That's the important part.
[251.90 → 252.76] Mission accomplished.
[253.28 → 256.90] You know, look, the videos are just a distraction, okay?
[256.94 → 258.66] That's the shiny object I hold up.
[258.72 → 259.18] The keys.
[259.30 → 260.24] I'm jangling the keys.
[261.04 → 262.08] Lttstore.com.
[262.18 → 263.20] That's the real play.
[265.46 → 265.90] Yeah.
[265.90 → 269.32] Oh, that video was so much fun to make, actually.
[269.46 → 270.56] That was a total blast.
[270.66 → 277.84] Guys, you should have seen Luke's other takes because it's possible that they were worse.
[279.44 → 281.88] Yeah, they probably were.
[282.14 → 282.42] Yeah.
[283.10 → 284.66] I actually don't know if they were.
[284.72 → 286.38] I think that might have been the worst one.
[286.50 → 292.00] I think they might have intentionally taken the least believable take of that scene.
[292.60 → 295.06] And guys, guys, it was amazing.
[295.06 → 298.36] So I actually watched Riley coaching Luke.
[298.68 → 302.22] Like, Riley was Luke's acting coach for that shot.
[302.58 → 306.26] And he's like, he's like, he's showing him how to do the cry, right?
[306.52 → 308.68] And it's like, he's like, okay, no, no, don't worry.
[308.74 → 309.54] You don't have to cry.
[309.62 → 309.90] You just.
[309.90 → 314.80] Can you do the cry for us, Luke?
[315.20 → 316.14] Can you cry a little bit?
[316.24 → 319.54] I could try, but I'm so bad, as everyone has seen.
[319.92 → 328.08] And like, he wanted me to crunch over as if I got like hit in the side and then just scrunch my face as much as possible.
[328.20 → 329.66] That was my like guidance.
[329.66 → 331.44] So I was supposed to just be like.
[337.08 → 340.96] And that was it.
[342.48 → 344.12] There was no like follow up.
[344.20 → 345.54] I wasn't supposed to make any noise.
[345.70 → 346.00] I was just.
[346.00 → 350.16] When he did the.
[350.46 → 351.50] Because I told him.
[351.58 → 353.06] I told him when we were reviewing the script.
[353.16 → 354.02] I was like, look, Riley.
[355.78 → 356.42] That's not.
[356.56 → 357.80] I don't think that's going to fly.
[357.96 → 358.56] Because he had it.
[358.60 → 359.96] He actually had a lot of.
[360.66 → 362.48] More acting heavy.
[362.48 → 365.30] Things written into the original script.
[365.84 → 368.60] So Colton was actually going to be the mastermind.
[368.86 → 370.02] And I was just like.
[370.32 → 372.06] A pawn in his game.
[372.50 → 373.28] And he had like.
[373.50 → 374.60] All these interactions.
[374.80 → 374.96] Oops.
[375.18 → 375.56] Sorry, guys.
[375.92 → 378.46] And he had all these interactions between me and Colton.
[378.58 → 379.48] Like scripted out.
[379.80 → 380.56] Where he was going.
[380.60 → 381.12] I was going to be like.
[381.16 → 381.68] Oh, I'm sorry.
[381.74 → 382.76] I'm sorry for doing it wrong.
[383.10 → 384.48] And Colton was going to like yell at me.
[384.72 → 385.86] It's R.O.G.
[386.22 → 388.22] Can't you get that through your idiot head?
[388.22 → 388.48] Like.
[388.68 → 388.98] Like.
[389.18 → 391.08] There was a whole different dynamic to it.
[391.12 → 391.62] And I was like.
[392.48 → 393.08] Look.
[394.32 → 395.28] Here's the problem.
[396.34 → 398.98] The acting skill that you have to work with here.
[399.52 → 402.78] May not be up to the standards that you're accustomed to.
[402.88 → 403.66] Mr. Murdoch.
[404.56 → 405.72] And he's like.
[405.80 → 406.18] No, no.
[406.22 → 407.16] This isn't that hard.
[407.32 → 407.80] And I'm like.
[408.18 → 408.72] No, no.
[408.82 → 409.46] It's hard.
[409.84 → 410.14] Anyway.
[410.32 → 410.54] So.
[410.86 → 412.38] When we were on the iteration.
[412.66 → 414.32] Where I'm like the jerk.
[414.48 → 414.66] Because.
[415.24 → 416.06] I don't know what it is.
[416.06 → 418.02] But I have a really easy time.
[418.12 → 418.66] Playing like.
[419.08 → 420.80] A total jerk boss on camera.
[421.84 → 422.44] You know.
[422.56 → 422.98] It's like.
[423.24 → 425.20] It feels like I'm barely even acting.
[425.40 → 425.62] You know.
[425.78 → 426.00] I just.
[428.06 → 428.38] Um.
[429.26 → 429.52] You know.
[429.56 → 431.02] It's just all the things I want to say.
[431.10 → 431.92] I just let them out.
[433.66 → 434.10] Um.
[434.18 → 434.50] No.
[434.58 → 434.70] No.
[434.76 → 435.22] For real though.
[435.22 → 435.66] Like I.
[435.70 → 435.98] I.
[435.98 → 436.02] I.
[436.02 → 436.30] I.
[436.30 → 436.34] I.
[436.34 → 436.60] I.
[436.60 → 436.64] I.
[436.64 → 438.22] I really enjoy playing the bad guy.
[438.32 → 439.00] For whatever reason.
[439.14 → 440.78] I have way too much fun with it.
[441.12 → 442.14] And when I'm having fun.
[442.24 → 442.56] It's just.
[442.66 → 442.82] I.
[442.82 → 444.08] I just find it really easy.
[444.38 → 444.62] So.
[444.74 → 445.50] We're on the iteration.
[445.50 → 446.96] Where I'm just like.
[447.12 → 447.56] The jerk.
[447.72 → 449.66] Who knows absolutely nothing about computers.
[449.66 → 450.76] Rather than being like.
[450.80 → 452.02] A victim in all of this.
[452.68 → 453.04] And.
[453.04 → 453.14] Um.
[453.70 → 453.86] He.
[454.00 → 455.18] He shows me the.
[455.44 → 457.06] The dialogue for your interview.
[457.06 → 457.70] And I'm like.
[458.68 → 459.82] Luke can't act.
[460.46 → 461.42] He can't cry.
[462.46 → 464.02] You can't ask that of him.
[464.60 → 465.42] And he's like.
[465.48 → 465.72] No.
[465.76 → 465.88] No.
[465.90 → 466.34] Don't worry.
[466.50 → 467.04] It's easy.
[467.20 → 468.06] All he has to do us.
[469.12 → 469.86] And I'm like.
[470.60 → 470.96] Okay.
[471.06 → 471.42] Maybe.
[474.22 → 475.64] That's how he sold me on it.
[475.76 → 477.86] The way he did it was so funny though.
[477.90 → 479.34] That guy is so funny.
[480.04 → 480.36] Yes.
[480.42 → 481.24] He's hilarious.
[482.06 → 482.50] He's much.
[482.58 → 483.68] Much funnier than I am.
[483.68 → 484.20] And like.
[484.30 → 484.70] I.
[484.78 → 486.22] I tried to even explain.
[486.72 → 487.96] Linus kept on just saying like.
[488.04 → 488.70] I told you so.
[488.98 → 489.96] Because I was trying to explain to Riley.
[490.06 → 490.20] Like.
[490.34 → 491.46] I can't do this.
[492.88 → 493.78] This is not.
[493.78 → 495.02] My type of acting.
[495.20 → 496.32] I can act like.
[496.46 → 497.56] Upset or angry.
[498.38 → 498.66] Yeah.
[498.80 → 498.96] Well.
[499.06 → 500.12] You can handle anger.
[500.34 → 500.76] Pretty well.
[500.84 → 501.00] Yeah.
[501.22 → 502.40] Like we've done some.
[502.52 → 503.26] Some skits.
[503.50 → 504.10] And like some.
[504.24 → 505.26] Just kind of goofy.
[505.44 → 505.88] Cringy.
[506.10 → 506.86] Stuff like that.
[506.92 → 508.32] Where Luke has to act angry.
[508.54 → 509.64] And he can do it.
[510.20 → 511.20] Like he's kind of scary.
[513.20 → 514.94] Got like a hundred pounds on me.
[517.16 → 517.64] I.
[517.94 → 518.10] The.
[518.18 → 518.60] The like.
[520.10 → 520.58] Sad.
[520.82 → 521.14] Or.
[521.80 → 523.08] Interested when I'm not.
[523.08 → 523.68] That.
[523.68 → 524.88] Which is a bit of an issue.
[524.88 → 526.10] When you're reviewing things.
[526.26 → 527.70] And like a few other things.
[527.70 → 528.10] I have.
[528.36 → 529.04] Troubles with.
[529.22 → 529.36] Yeah.
[529.98 → 530.18] Yeah.
[530.28 → 530.86] Anger though.
[530.98 → 531.22] Anger.
[531.30 → 532.08] Luke can act angry.
[532.22 → 533.10] And I can act like.
[533.24 → 533.66] A jerk.
[534.18 → 534.62] So like.
[534.96 → 535.66] Whenever we.
[535.78 → 536.94] Whenever we've done skits.
[536.94 → 537.32] Where like.
[537.44 → 538.28] I'm supposed to be a jerk.
[538.28 → 539.64] And he's supposed to be mad about it.
[539.70 → 540.10] It's like.
[540.22 → 540.90] People are like.
[540.90 → 541.22] Wow.
[541.22 → 542.24] These guys can act.
[542.48 → 542.74] I was like.
[543.52 → 543.92] No.
[544.24 → 544.86] Not really.
[544.96 → 545.50] Not really.
[545.60 → 546.36] The one dimensional.
[547.16 → 547.56] Yeah.
[547.56 → 548.08] All right.
[548.12 → 548.98] Why don't we jump into.
[549.26 → 550.58] Our first topic for the day.
[551.22 → 551.86] You know what.
[551.86 → 552.72] Let's go straight into.
[553.04 → 553.56] Samsung.
[554.38 → 555.08] To be.
[555.40 → 555.80] Ceasing.
[556.24 → 556.54] All.
[556.84 → 557.24] LCD.
[557.48 → 557.88] Production.
[558.66 → 558.92] So.
[559.16 → 559.76] This is.
[560.52 → 561.32] South Korean.
[561.46 → 561.96] Panel maker.
[562.12 → 562.84] Samsung display.
[562.84 → 563.36] This is from.
[563.36 → 563.78] Reuters.
[563.92 → 564.42] Dot com.
[565.08 → 566.22] Has decided to end.
[566.34 → 567.26] All of its production.
[567.50 → 568.08] Of LCD.
[568.82 → 569.50] Displays.
[569.68 → 570.32] In South Korea.
[570.48 → 571.20] And China.
[571.38 → 572.90] By the end of this year.
[573.38 → 574.30] So just to clarify.
[574.30 → 577.00] This is Samsung display.
[577.54 → 579.40] Which like LG display.
[579.64 → 581.28] Is not the same thing as.
[581.68 → 583.50] Samsung electronics co limited.
[583.72 → 584.82] The company that you would buy.
[584.98 → 585.46] Your fancy.
[586.00 → 586.94] Galaxy smartphone.
[587.38 → 589.16] Or even your Samsung branded.
[589.48 → 590.58] Consumer TV from.
[591.02 → 592.28] So Samsung display.
[592.68 → 593.86] Makes panels.
[594.28 → 595.76] That they then actually sell.
[596.16 → 597.42] To the separate company.
[597.56 → 598.80] Samsung electronics co limited.
[599.10 → 600.36] So that's how you avoid.
[600.78 → 602.54] A situation where Apple.
[602.54 → 604.22] Is suing Samsung.
[604.30 → 605.84] Over copying the iPhone.
[605.98 → 606.38] Or whatever.
[607.06 → 607.56] And then.
[608.48 → 609.94] Apple also needs to buy.
[610.10 → 610.76] Display panels.
[611.14 → 611.92] From Samsung.
[612.14 → 613.28] Those are two separate companies.
[613.40 → 613.72] Actually.
[615.34 → 616.46] And they will definitely.
[616.64 → 617.34] Continue to work together.
[617.62 → 618.82] One really important.
[618.82 → 619.62] Note here too.
[619.98 → 620.86] Is that they're ceasing.
[620.98 → 621.58] The production of.
[621.98 → 622.38] LCD.
[622.78 → 623.54] They're not ceasing.
[623.64 → 624.46] The production of.
[624.84 → 625.76] Screens or panels.
[625.90 → 626.38] They're just ceasing.
[626.50 → 626.98] The production of.
[627.54 → 627.90] LCD.
[628.56 → 629.28] Screens and panels.
[629.42 → 629.68] They are.
[629.96 → 630.92] They're moving to.
[630.92 → 631.30] OLED.
[631.52 → 632.20] And stuff like that.
[632.30 → 632.98] They're moving on.
[633.08 → 633.78] They're moving forward.
[633.78 → 634.98] So one thing.
[634.98 → 635.96] That's a little bit.
[635.96 → 637.50] Confusing to me.
[638.00 → 638.48] Is.
[638.70 → 639.18] I.
[639.38 → 640.26] I can't.
[640.90 → 641.62] Like I.
[642.14 → 643.82] It drives me crazy.
[643.82 → 644.62] But I think.
[645.04 → 645.62] Part of this.
[645.62 → 646.44] Is just like.
[646.60 → 647.00] Like a.
[647.38 → 647.90] Branding.
[648.14 → 648.38] Thing.
[648.88 → 649.78] Because Samsung.
[649.96 → 651.06] Can you turn your notifications down?
[651.34 → 651.96] Because Samsung.
[651.96 → 652.86] Is ceasing.
[653.28 → 654.38] The production of.
[655.18 → 655.66] LCD's.
[655.90 → 657.18] But they are going to.
[657.42 → 658.50] Keep manufacturing.
[658.76 → 659.40] So the investment.
[659.40 → 660.18] For the next five years.
[660.18 → 660.96] Will be focused on.
[660.96 → 662.08] Converting one of the South Korean.
[662.08 → 662.90] LCD lines.
[663.32 → 664.04] Into a facility.
[664.24 → 664.96] To mass produce.
[665.18 → 665.90] More advanced.
[666.34 → 667.66] Quantum dot screens.
[668.38 → 668.52] Yeah.
[668.68 → 668.84] There.
[668.96 → 669.32] I think.
[669.42 → 669.82] They are.
[670.20 → 670.54] They are.
[671.58 → 672.14] Legitimately.
[672.38 → 672.72] I think.
[672.88 → 674.04] Part of this announcement.
[674.20 → 674.88] Is a.
[675.00 → 675.50] Is a.
[675.70 → 675.82] Like.
[676.02 → 676.80] Marketing ploy.
[678.06 → 678.82] Because they're like.
[678.88 → 679.38] They're different.
[680.26 → 680.58] Yeah.
[680.66 → 681.18] They're new.
[681.54 → 682.50] The thing is that.
[682.66 → 683.54] They're not the same.
[683.54 → 684.30] So.
[684.58 → 685.48] So right now.
[685.60 → 686.22] Samsung's.
[686.30 → 686.82] Entire.
[687.14 → 687.86] LED.
[688.34 → 688.82] Lineup.
[688.94 → 689.82] Is based on.
[690.02 → 690.96] LCD panels.
[691.20 → 691.84] With a.
[691.92 → 692.78] Quantum dot layer.
[692.92 → 694.28] That helps them be more efficient.
[694.58 → 695.84] And have a wider colour gamut.
[695.88 → 696.60] And all those benefits.
[696.60 → 697.22] That you get.
[697.56 → 698.78] From quantum dots.
[700.86 → 701.38] But.
[701.54 → 702.34] Samsung has.
[702.66 → 703.46] It seems.
[703.62 → 704.74] Very intentionally.
[705.04 → 705.70] Branded their.
[705.78 → 706.78] LED displays.
[707.36 → 708.14] Very similarly.
[708.50 → 709.14] To OLED.
[709.44 → 710.58] And very separately.
[711.00 → 711.20] From.
[711.82 → 712.46] LCD's.
[712.46 → 713.54] So.
[713.86 → 715.04] What's not clear to me.
[715.08 → 716.00] Right now though.
[716.36 → 717.46] Is when they say.
[717.62 → 718.08] And this is.
[718.16 → 718.74] This is a quote.
[718.74 → 719.40] From the article.
[719.66 → 720.50] When they say.
[720.66 → 720.90] They were.
[721.00 → 721.58] They're going to produce.
[721.58 → 722.56] More advanced.
[722.74 → 723.72] Quantum dot screens.
[723.88 → 724.76] What they're not saying.
[724.86 → 726.04] Is whether those are going to be.
[726.46 → 727.28] Quantum dot screens.
[727.80 → 728.04] With.
[729.22 → 729.66] LCD's.
[729.66 → 730.12] As the.
[730.28 → 731.52] The foundational technology.
[732.06 → 732.44] Or.
[732.56 → 733.78] If those are going to be.
[733.96 → 734.70] The upcoming.
[735.36 → 736.50] I've heard rumours of this.
[736.54 → 737.52] I actually haven't looked into it.
[737.60 → 738.00] For a while.
[738.08 → 738.52] So I don't know.
[738.60 → 739.76] How solid any of it is.
[739.84 → 739.96] But.
[740.30 → 740.80] The upcoming.
[741.08 → 741.48] OLED.
[741.48 → 742.44] Based.
[742.72 → 744.06] Quantum dot displays.
[744.06 → 744.30] Because.
[744.78 → 746.06] There's no actual reason.
[746.06 → 747.42] That you couldn't use.
[748.00 → 749.04] An OLED panel.
[749.42 → 750.46] And quantum dot.
[750.88 → 751.08] To.
[751.68 → 752.46] Work with each other.
[752.52 → 753.72] I just think no one has done it.
[754.10 → 754.54] Yet.
[755.24 → 756.76] Don't quote me on any of that though.
[756.82 → 757.06] I just.
[757.18 → 757.56] I was like.
[757.64 → 758.70] Up late reading.
[759.12 → 759.84] Months ago.
[760.22 → 761.44] And was looking into that.
[761.56 → 761.76] But.
[761.88 → 762.80] So we just don't know.
[762.94 → 764.64] What kind of quantum dot displays.
[764.76 → 766.18] Samsung's going to be working on over there.
[766.18 → 768.26] Whatever they end up doing.
[768.26 → 769.52] They're far from ending.
[769.94 → 770.86] Display production.
[771.18 → 771.40] Oh yeah.
[771.86 → 772.82] If anything else.
[772.82 → 774.46] They're just like retooling their facility.
[775.64 → 776.74] And moving forward.
[776.88 → 777.88] The big announcement here.
[778.00 → 779.04] Is really that they're investing.
[779.30 → 781.14] 10.72 billion dollars.
[781.34 → 782.14] In their facilities.
[782.14 → 783.04] And research.
[783.46 → 784.94] To convert their current.
[785.02 → 786.30] LCD production facilities.
[786.80 → 787.56] To more advanced.
[787.70 → 789.12] Quantum dot production facilities.
[789.34 → 789.44] Yeah.
[789.52 → 791.20] Whatever that necessarily means.
[791.20 → 792.64] In terms of what's driving it behind it.
[792.70 → 793.96] Is slightly up in the air right now.
[793.96 → 794.94] No that is in our notes.
[795.06 → 795.42] Oh good.
[795.58 → 795.98] Yeah good.
[796.04 → 796.82] It wasn't in that article.
[796.94 → 797.88] But it must be in one of the other ones.
[797.94 → 798.88] So the first iteration.
[799.04 → 800.42] Of these more advanced quantum dot screens.
[800.52 → 800.64] Yay.
[800.94 → 802.28] Will use OLED displays.
[802.46 → 803.76] And quantum dot as a film.
[803.86 → 805.46] They're expected to the market in 2022.
[805.76 → 805.88] Woo.
[806.24 → 806.40] Cool.
[806.50 → 806.74] So we're good.
[806.82 → 806.94] Yeah.
[807.36 → 808.52] So they currently run.
[808.66 → 809.78] Two LCD production lines.
[809.86 → 810.80] At factories in South Korea.
[810.92 → 812.46] And two LCD only factories.
[812.82 → 813.86] In China.
[814.20 → 814.78] Last October.
[814.78 → 816.86] They suspended one of the LCD Korean lines.
[817.42 → 818.56] They have not yet decided.
[818.56 → 819.46] On the future operation.
[819.58 → 820.14] Of their factories.
[820.46 → 821.10] In China.
[821.76 → 822.68] LG display.
[822.82 → 823.86] Said earlier this year.
[823.86 → 824.64] That they're going to halt.
[824.74 → 826.48] Domestic production of LCD TV panels.
[826.48 → 827.56] By the end of 2020.
[827.74 → 828.42] So it looks like.
[829.54 → 830.76] Basically what's happened.
[831.04 → 831.22] Whoops.
[831.64 → 831.88] Sorry.
[832.18 → 833.54] Basically what's happened is.
[833.66 → 835.20] The Chinese LCD makers.
[835.42 → 835.96] Have come in.
[836.04 → 837.20] Flooded the market with panels.
[837.20 → 838.18] At lower prices.
[838.18 → 839.52] And it's no longer profitable.
[839.52 → 840.86] To produce LCDs.
[840.90 → 841.44] The good news.
[841.78 → 842.90] Is that if you're Samsung.
[843.08 → 843.88] And you're LG.
[844.24 → 845.60] You're used to playing this game.
[846.22 → 847.66] You're always trying to get.
[847.66 → 849.14] One step out ahead of the curve.
[849.24 → 849.86] So that's why.
[850.28 → 850.80] For the last.
[851.16 → 851.30] Three.
[851.46 → 851.66] Four.
[851.66 → 852.30] Five.
[852.30 → 853.22] Ten years.
[853.22 → 854.38] You've been working on.
[854.38 → 855.00] Refining.
[855.54 → 855.86] OLED.
[856.28 → 857.42] Or you've been working on.
[857.84 → 858.28] MicroLED.
[858.68 → 859.08] And so.
[859.40 → 859.98] By the time.
[860.02 → 860.90] LCD gets.
[861.22 → 861.62] Cheap.
[861.98 → 862.66] And you know.
[862.70 → 863.74] Basically anyone can.
[864.06 → 865.36] Buy a gigantic TV.
[865.36 → 866.58] For a few hundred dollars.
[866.58 → 867.22] That's big enough.
[867.22 → 868.10] To fill their living room.
[868.44 → 868.90] Which is.
[869.12 → 870.06] Basically where we're at.
[870.18 → 871.18] They're going to have something.
[871.18 → 871.86] That's newer.
[872.22 → 872.78] And better.
[872.90 → 873.66] And more compelling.
[873.84 → 874.80] In some meaningful way.
[874.80 → 875.54] That they can, actually.
[875.54 → 876.26] Make a decent.
[876.40 → 877.22] Amount of margin on.
[877.88 → 878.14] Yeah.
[878.14 → 879.72] So I.
[879.78 → 880.42] For one.
[880.50 → 881.58] Am super excited.
[881.58 → 882.68] About micro LED.
[883.02 → 883.72] Getting to.
[884.20 → 886.00] A new level of affordability.
[886.00 → 886.86] Because the performance.
[886.86 → 888.02] Is already amazing.
[888.32 → 889.04] You haven't done.
[889.10 → 889.56] A trade show.
[889.70 → 890.34] With us in a while.
[890.46 → 892.28] But micro LED displays.
[892.28 → 893.16] Have gotten.
[893.98 → 894.50] Freaking.
[894.92 → 895.44] Nuts.
[895.86 → 896.26] And.
[896.50 → 896.78] You know.
[897.12 → 897.92] I think we are.
[898.24 → 899.48] TV manufacturers.
[899.48 → 900.32] Are up against.
[900.48 → 901.36] A lot of.
[901.78 → 903.38] A lot of.
[903.70 → 904.10] Bottlenecks.
[904.10 → 904.70] Right now.
[904.70 → 906.00] And by bottlenecks.
[906.06 → 906.38] I mean.
[906.66 → 907.14] Bottlenecks.
[907.34 → 907.98] In the.
[908.22 → 908.94] In the ways.
[909.04 → 909.60] That they can make.
[909.72 → 910.22] The user.
[910.84 → 911.28] Experience.
[911.40 → 912.06] More enjoyable.
[912.38 → 913.68] So for a long time.
[914.02 → 914.66] It was.
[914.78 → 915.70] Making your TV.
[916.00 → 916.48] You know.
[916.56 → 917.70] Possible to move around.
[917.80 → 918.26] And making it.
[918.32 → 919.08] Take up less space.
[919.20 → 919.84] In your living room.
[920.00 → 920.18] Right.
[921.04 → 921.80] Back when we went.
[922.00 → 923.00] From CRTs.
[923.28 → 923.86] To you know.
[923.94 → 924.38] Plasmas.
[924.60 → 925.10] Or like.
[925.22 → 926.38] The early LCDs.
[926.64 → 927.06] I mean.
[927.08 → 927.80] The early LCDs.
[927.80 → 928.88] They didn't have an image quality.
[928.88 → 930.06] Advantage over CRT.
[930.48 → 930.72] Right.
[931.40 → 931.68] Yeah.
[931.84 → 932.74] And they were more expensive.
[932.84 → 933.24] They were just.
[933.34 → 933.90] They were slimmer.
[933.90 → 934.86] And that was cool.
[935.20 → 935.88] They weren't.
[935.98 → 937.72] They didn't weigh an obscene amount.
[937.82 → 938.14] They weren't like.
[938.22 → 939.12] Impossible to move.
[939.20 → 939.34] Yeah.
[939.46 → 940.00] You could mount them.
[940.22 → 940.48] Exactly.
[940.48 → 941.12] Up on a wall.
[941.44 → 942.72] Other cool stuff like that.
[942.82 → 943.58] So next up.
[943.68 → 944.88] Was the resolution war.
[945.26 → 946.44] So we went from.
[946.64 → 946.98] You know.
[947.16 → 948.24] What is it?
[949.14 → 949.58] Uh.
[949.74 → 950.28] Oh man.
[950.36 → 950.80] 12.
[951.00 → 951.90] 12 whatever.
[952.16 → 952.70] By like.
[952.78 → 953.56] 7.68.
[953.82 → 955.72] Being an HD TV.
[956.14 → 956.54] Up to.
[956.62 → 956.78] You know.
[956.82 → 957.72] Now you've got 4K.
[957.80 → 958.80] And even 8K.
[958.90 → 959.78] Displays on the market.
[960.12 → 960.46] All right.
[960.80 → 961.20] Meanwhile.
[961.52 → 962.78] You've got the size war.
[962.78 → 965.58] Actually the size war probably came before the resolution war.
[965.66 → 966.92] They were really pushing up sizes.
[967.44 → 967.70] Uh.
[967.70 → 968.84] With like rear projection.
[969.32 → 971.18] And then with LCDs later.
[971.18 → 972.38] Once those got more affordable.
[972.88 → 974.02] Then we've got the resolution.
[974.14 → 974.40] Oh yeah.
[974.44 → 975.60] Then we've got the gimmicks in between.
[975.74 → 975.92] You know.
[975.96 → 976.52] Your 3D.
[976.90 → 977.06] Uh.
[977.06 → 977.92] stereoscopic 3D.
[978.04 → 978.26] Which.
[978.84 → 980.72] Actually was a very cool experience.
[980.72 → 982.54] On the first generation LG signature.
[982.72 → 983.62] Because Olds.
[984.00 → 984.24] Uh.
[984.24 → 985.96] OLED pixels are actually fast enough.
[986.12 → 987.88] That you got really great separation.
[988.08 → 989.34] And I was actually kind of disappointed.
[989.52 → 991.96] That the next generation signature did away with 3D.
[992.02 → 994.12] Because I own a couple of pretty great 3D Blu-rays.
[994.20 → 995.78] And they looked amazing.
[996.26 → 996.70] I was going to say.
[996.78 → 998.50] I think most people haven't had.
[998.58 → 999.42] Including myself.
[999.42 → 1000.22] I believe you.
[1000.50 → 1001.46] That you had this experience.
[1001.80 → 1002.94] But I think most people haven't had.
[1002.94 → 1004.46] A very positive like TV.
[1004.62 → 1005.52] 3D experience.
[1005.66 → 1006.52] It's because it's LCD.
[1006.72 → 1007.62] It's not fast enough.
[1008.00 → 1008.90] It's not fast enough.
[1009.02 → 1011.30] You have to have that clear image separation.
[1012.34 → 1013.10] And enough brightness.
[1013.56 → 1015.10] And in a dark room.
[1015.36 → 1016.08] That OLED.
[1016.52 → 1016.82] Wow.
[1017.02 → 1018.80] I think Taken has that at his house.
[1019.16 → 1020.48] So if you could convince him.
[1020.48 → 1022.02] To let you come over for a movie night.
[1022.38 → 1023.08] Not right now.
[1023.40 → 1023.86] Not right now.
[1024.04 → 1025.06] Movie night ain't a thing.
[1025.62 → 1025.94] Um.
[1026.12 → 1027.04] But it is.
[1027.16 → 1027.36] It is.
[1027.46 → 1029.10] I gave him the glasses too.
[1029.10 → 1030.98] He's got at least two pairs of glasses for it.
[1031.16 → 1032.12] So it's worth.
[1032.20 → 1032.66] It's worth trying.
[1032.70 → 1033.28] It's perfect.
[1033.64 → 1033.86] Um.
[1033.86 → 1034.16] So anyway.
[1034.22 → 1035.38] You had your gimmicks in there.
[1035.60 → 1036.38] And then.
[1036.66 → 1038.20] Now we're up against a problem.
[1038.58 → 1039.74] Because you can't.
[1040.08 → 1041.16] You can't make them any thinner.
[1041.64 → 1041.88] Right?
[1042.48 → 1043.52] It's already at the point.
[1043.64 → 1044.38] Where you can literally.
[1044.38 → 1046.00] Mount a TV on your wall.
[1046.12 → 1046.76] As wallpaper.
[1047.36 → 1047.60] Okay?
[1047.82 → 1048.32] If you.
[1048.40 → 1049.80] If you're willing to spend the money for it.
[1049.80 → 1051.72] And even the ones that you can't put on as wallpaper.
[1051.72 → 1052.56] Are good enough.
[1053.00 → 1053.88] You've reached the point.
[1053.88 → 1055.06] Where more resolution.
[1055.68 → 1056.70] Is actually meaningless.
[1057.32 → 1057.60] Um.
[1057.60 → 1059.08] Going from 4k to 8k.
[1059.74 → 1060.18] Um.
[1060.80 → 1061.02] Eh.
[1061.66 → 1062.48] And in fact.
[1062.88 → 1063.36] Meanwhile.
[1063.54 → 1063.94] So the.
[1063.94 → 1066.56] The TV manufacturers are pushing up the resolution.
[1066.78 → 1067.22] Meanwhile.
[1067.66 → 1069.28] NVIDIA is sitting over there.
[1069.34 → 1069.80] Going like.
[1069.86 → 1070.16] Oh yeah.
[1070.20 → 1071.18] We can just use like.
[1071.66 → 1072.78] AI upscaling.
[1073.24 → 1073.88] Too basically.
[1074.58 → 1074.78] Change.
[1074.94 → 1075.10] Like.
[1075.46 → 1075.86] Um.
[1075.86 → 1078.30] Increase the perceived sharpness of the image.
[1078.30 → 1079.76] In a way that doesn't degrade it.
[1080.08 → 1080.36] And.
[1080.36 → 1082.32] That tech is getting perfect.
[1082.76 → 1084.20] So it's integrated into the new.
[1084.20 → 1084.50] Uh.
[1084.50 → 1085.08] Shield TV.
[1085.24 → 1086.64] Jake's working on a review right now.
[1086.74 → 1087.90] And it'll take 1080p content.
[1087.90 → 1088.90] And upscale it to 4k.
[1088.96 → 1089.22] It's like.
[1090.04 → 1090.68] It's looking.
[1090.86 → 1091.90] It's looking pretty fine.
[1091.98 → 1092.50] Pretty tight.
[1093.04 → 1093.34] Um.
[1093.34 → 1093.50] That's cool.
[1093.56 → 1093.94] So okay.
[1093.94 → 1095.16] That's totally pointless.
[1095.46 → 1095.94] And then.
[1096.16 → 1097.78] The size of the displays themselves.
[1098.02 → 1099.22] Has gotten to the point where.
[1099.82 → 1100.52] You can.
[1100.68 → 1100.82] Like.
[1101.04 → 1101.32] The.
[1101.32 → 1104.00] I'm not going to say the average family.
[1104.32 → 1105.20] But I'm going to say.
[1105.36 → 1105.66] The like.
[1105.74 → 1106.78] American dream family.
[1106.86 → 1107.06] Okay.
[1107.16 → 1108.04] So you got your minivan.
[1108.32 → 1109.78] You got your suburban house.
[1110.30 → 1110.70] Um.
[1110.76 → 1111.70] You know what I'm talking about.
[1111.70 → 1111.92] Right.
[1112.64 → 1113.54] They can afford.
[1114.02 → 1114.84] A 65.
[1115.34 → 1117.08] To 77-inch TV.
[1117.22 → 1118.88] Assuming that they're not buying a new one every year.
[1118.96 → 1119.44] You know what I mean?
[1119.44 → 1119.64] Like.
[1119.72 → 1120.04] If you are.
[1120.54 → 1122.46] Upgrading your TV on a reasonable cycle.
[1122.64 → 1123.56] Like every five years.
[1123.62 → 1124.24] Or something like that.
[1124.30 → 1124.58] You can.
[1125.22 → 1125.54] Any.
[1125.54 → 1126.30] Anyone.
[1126.78 → 1127.08] You know.
[1127.08 → 1127.74] Like the.
[1128.44 → 1129.18] A family.
[1129.54 → 1131.58] Can own a gigantic TV.
[1131.76 → 1133.14] Like the kind people used to.
[1133.50 → 1135.48] Assume that you had to be a millionaire to own.
[1135.62 → 1135.70] It's.
[1135.80 → 1136.92] That's not the case anymore.
[1137.22 → 1139.78] And it's to the point where you can't even transport them.
[1140.44 → 1140.92] There's like.
[1140.98 → 1141.28] I think.
[1141.36 → 1142.52] I think there's like 65.
[1142.70 → 1143.60] If you find the right.
[1143.96 → 1144.74] Chinese panel.
[1144.96 → 1146.60] You can get like 65 inches.
[1147.04 → 1147.40] TVs.
[1147.56 → 1148.72] This might be in US dollars.
[1148.72 → 1149.38] To be clear.
[1149.70 → 1150.00] Uh.
[1150.00 → 1150.74] But for like 300.
[1150.88 → 1151.60] 350 bucks.
[1151.76 → 1152.16] Exactly.
[1152.42 → 1153.06] That's what I'm talking about.
[1153.06 → 1153.60] And the $300.
[1154.30 → 1155.52] Which is probably a little.
[1155.54 → 1156.02] Higher now.
[1156.12 → 1157.26] So probably close to 350.
[1157.38 → 1157.80] 399.
[1158.08 → 1159.28] Is like the target.
[1159.46 → 1160.94] Big electronic purchase price.
[1161.48 → 1162.16] It's like your Xbox.
[1162.40 → 1162.88] Your PlayStation.
[1163.16 → 1163.86] Your Switch.
[1164.06 → 1164.44] Your TV.
[1164.96 → 1166.14] They're all around that price.
[1166.24 → 1166.74] Because that's.
[1167.04 → 1167.46] Uh.
[1167.56 → 1168.58] More digestible.
[1168.74 → 1169.54] For that target.
[1169.66 → 1170.20] You were just talking about.
[1170.20 → 1171.04] That's the disposable.
[1171.46 → 1172.06] That's the like.
[1172.14 → 1173.22] This disposable income.
[1173.36 → 1174.26] Magic number.
[1174.36 → 1174.88] That's why.
[1175.10 → 1175.46] The Switch.
[1175.58 → 1175.80] Yeah.
[1175.86 → 1176.02] Like.
[1176.08 → 1176.30] Yeah.
[1176.30 → 1177.08] Every game console.
[1177.08 → 1177.48] Basically.
[1177.62 → 1177.72] Like.
[1177.80 → 1178.22] That's what.
[1178.32 → 1178.52] You know.
[1178.58 → 1179.66] Early discmans.
[1180.04 → 1180.40] Cost.
[1180.82 → 1180.96] You know.
[1181.00 → 1181.72] Mini disc players.
[1181.92 → 1182.08] Like.
[1182.70 → 1183.64] That's the price point.
[1183.70 → 1184.50] Everyone's going for.
[1184.62 → 1185.20] For a reason.
[1185.74 → 1186.02] Um.
[1186.06 → 1187.10] But they're at the point now.
[1187.22 → 1187.36] Where.
[1187.74 → 1188.58] You can't really.
[1188.74 → 1188.90] Okay.
[1188.98 → 1189.26] We can.
[1189.40 → 1190.28] HDR can get better.
[1190.58 → 1191.64] HDR can keep getting better.
[1191.72 → 1191.84] But.
[1192.18 → 1193.08] To a lot of people.
[1193.08 → 1194.16] That's not going to be.
[1194.16 → 1194.98] As meaningful.
[1195.04 → 1195.90] Of an improvement.
[1196.12 → 1197.42] And now that you can get.
[1197.52 → 1197.92] A 4k.
[1197.96 → 1198.66] 120 hertz.
[1199.20 → 1199.46] TV.
[1199.58 → 1199.68] Like.
[1199.78 → 1200.92] You finally bought a TV.
[1201.18 → 1202.32] After all these years.
[1202.46 → 1202.72] Yes.
[1202.84 → 1203.66] Which one did you go with?
[1203.70 → 1204.32] Did you go with the B.
[1204.36 → 1205.04] Or the C series?
[1205.84 → 1206.14] The.
[1206.24 → 1207.76] The one you recommended.
[1208.26 → 1208.52] Okay.
[1208.56 → 1209.44] I think it was a B.
[1209.44 → 1209.50] I think it was a B.
[1209.50 → 1209.78] The B.
[1209.90 → 1210.12] Yeah.
[1210.56 → 1211.22] It's like.
[1211.78 → 1212.18] Basically.
[1212.38 → 1212.78] It's amazing.
[1212.78 → 1214.82] And I got it at the perfect time.
[1215.04 → 1215.70] Because now we are.
[1216.14 → 1217.06] My whole.
[1217.06 → 1217.70] My roommate.
[1217.82 → 1218.50] My girlfriend and I.
[1218.58 → 1220.20] Are all quarantined in the house.
[1220.40 → 1221.94] And now we have this sweet TV.
[1222.12 → 1223.60] So it's actually worked out really well.
[1223.60 → 1224.92] Have you gamed on it yet?
[1225.92 → 1226.90] Not much.
[1227.00 → 1227.48] But a little bit.
[1227.54 → 1227.74] Yes.
[1227.96 → 1228.16] So.
[1228.32 → 1229.16] And it's nice.
[1229.28 → 1230.02] We're at the point now.
[1230.14 → 1231.30] Where you can get a 4k.
[1231.52 → 1232.48] 120 hertz.
[1232.68 → 1233.58] OLED panel.
[1233.76 → 1234.14] For like.
[1234.76 → 1235.04] You know.
[1235.24 → 1236.02] Pretty affordable.
[1236.68 → 1238.02] And it's got great HDR.
[1238.36 → 1238.54] So.
[1238.76 → 1238.90] So.
[1239.06 → 1239.78] So basically.
[1239.78 → 1241.24] In order to improve things.
[1241.40 → 1242.80] You kind of got to go big again.
[1243.10 → 1243.48] Like.
[1243.64 → 1244.24] I think.
[1244.48 → 1244.72] That.
[1245.06 → 1246.42] You could convince you.
[1246.56 → 1247.06] To upgrade.
[1247.06 → 1248.16] If you could have.
[1248.30 → 1249.24] Like your whole wall.
[1249.82 → 1250.62] Covered in TV.
[1251.14 → 1252.04] For like the same price.
[1252.08 → 1252.82] As what you paid now.
[1253.32 → 1254.00] Hold on though.
[1254.08 → 1254.42] Hold on.
[1254.42 → 1255.28] We're talking with.
[1255.30 → 1255.62] Not now.
[1255.74 → 1257.74] We're talking with perfect black levels.
[1258.12 → 1258.34] Right.
[1258.42 → 1259.98] Because that's what micro LED offers.
[1260.18 → 1260.94] It's perfect black.
[1261.02 → 1261.60] Just like OLED.
[1262.04 → 1263.56] So what you could effectively do.
[1263.88 → 1264.28] Is like.
[1264.54 → 1266.18] Cover your wall with these panels.
[1266.62 → 1267.72] And then you could have like.
[1267.80 → 1269.02] A configurable TV.
[1269.42 → 1270.36] So you could have it be like.
[1270.46 → 1271.94] Super ultra panoramic.
[1271.94 → 1272.66] For movies.
[1273.14 → 1274.20] You could have it be like.
[1274.50 → 1275.70] Huge for just like.
[1275.94 → 1276.16] You know.
[1276.16 → 1276.96] Video chatting.
[1277.54 → 1278.10] You could have.
[1278.10 → 1278.74] A like.
[1278.98 → 1279.86] Live wall.
[1280.08 → 1280.34] Yeah.
[1280.64 → 1281.28] A live wall.
[1281.32 → 1281.78] That could be like.
[1281.90 → 1282.52] One of those.
[1283.18 → 1283.82] You know the.
[1283.82 → 1284.30] Like.
[1284.68 → 1286.44] The TV itself has this.
[1286.58 → 1288.30] But the Chromecast version is way better.
[1288.64 → 1289.08] When it is like.
[1289.48 → 1289.64] Play.
[1289.76 → 1291.16] It puts random pictures on the screen.
[1291.34 → 1291.78] Exactly.
[1291.96 → 1293.28] You had a live wall.
[1293.28 → 1293.52] Yes.
[1293.52 → 1294.58] That was kind of like that.
[1294.78 → 1295.70] And you could have like.
[1295.84 → 1296.46] A moving.
[1297.62 → 1299.12] I know it said moving picture.
[1299.26 → 1299.94] But you know what I mean.
[1300.34 → 1300.48] Like.
[1300.60 → 1301.80] Like a still camera.
[1301.80 → 1303.18] Long term shot.
[1303.18 → 1303.82] Of like.
[1303.82 → 1305.02] Like the hills of Switzerland.
[1305.02 → 1306.30] Or some craziness like that.
[1306.36 → 1306.86] That's coming.
[1306.86 → 1307.26] That would be amazing.
[1307.46 → 1308.20] That's coming.
[1308.66 → 1310.46] And I bet not far behind it.
[1310.52 → 1311.24] Is going to be like.
[1311.32 → 1312.84] The built-in eye tracking technology.
[1312.84 → 1314.36] So that as you walk past it.
[1314.42 → 1314.62] Like.
[1314.72 → 1315.50] It's like a window.
[1316.00 → 1317.02] And cool stuff like that.
[1317.06 → 1317.94] It's absolutely coming.
[1318.22 → 1319.20] And I think that's.
[1319.38 → 1320.84] Really where they have to go.
[1320.94 → 1321.90] To incentivize anyone.
[1321.90 → 1323.14] Who's buying a TV today.
[1323.52 → 1324.18] To upgrade.
[1324.34 → 1324.66] Because.
[1325.02 → 1325.96] I'm at the point now.
[1325.96 → 1327.18] Where the one in my living room.
[1327.18 → 1328.78] Which is basically identical to yours.
[1328.82 → 1329.62] Is like end game.
[1330.40 → 1331.62] I don't desire.
[1331.64 → 1332.26] It feels like it.
[1332.42 → 1333.60] I don't desire anything else.
[1334.00 → 1334.38] Me neither.
[1334.64 → 1334.96] It's fine.
[1335.02 → 1335.34] One of the.
[1335.52 → 1335.84] This is.
[1335.90 → 1336.60] This is small.
[1336.76 → 1337.10] But I.
[1337.18 → 1338.48] I haven't owned a TV.
[1339.16 → 1339.56] Uh.
[1339.78 → 1340.02] I.
[1340.20 → 1340.82] This is the first.
[1340.90 → 1341.70] First TV.
[1341.70 → 1343.04] That I have ever purchased.
[1343.42 → 1344.82] I traded for one.
[1344.94 → 1345.98] I gave someone.
[1346.26 → 1347.60] Some RAM and a CPU cooler.
[1347.86 → 1348.00] Yeah.
[1348.08 → 1348.84] And I got a TV.
[1349.20 → 1350.00] This is the first TV.
[1350.10 → 1350.88] I've ever purchased.
[1351.36 → 1351.76] Um.
[1352.58 → 1352.98] And.
[1353.34 → 1354.78] We plugged the switch in.
[1354.90 → 1355.38] To the TV.
[1355.56 → 1356.12] Because my girlfriend.
[1356.24 → 1357.02] Wanted to play Animal Crossing.
[1357.02 → 1357.48] On the TV.
[1357.68 → 1358.82] And she grabbed the remote.
[1359.10 → 1360.76] And pressed the voice control button.
[1361.42 → 1362.10] And said.
[1362.48 → 1362.88] Uh.
[1363.06 → 1363.30] Like.
[1363.60 → 1364.78] Open Nintendo Switch.
[1364.78 → 1365.22] Or something.
[1365.94 → 1366.30] And I was like.
[1366.36 → 1366.46] Oh.
[1366.46 → 1367.16] That's not going to work.
[1367.22 → 1367.82] You have to tell it.
[1367.82 → 1368.00] Like.
[1368.16 → 1368.96] What input to go through.
[1369.26 → 1370.10] And the TV was just like.
[1370.24 → 1371.48] Opening Nintendo Switch.
[1371.52 → 1372.44] And just worked immediately.
[1372.94 → 1373.26] I was like.
[1373.36 → 1373.70] What?
[1374.18 → 1374.34] What?
[1375.68 → 1376.50] Stuff's pretty good.
[1376.50 → 1376.98] These days.
[1376.98 → 1377.34] Man.
[1377.76 → 1378.38] It's pretty good.
[1378.46 → 1379.04] That kind of stuff.
[1379.12 → 1379.66] Is pretty cool.
[1379.96 → 1380.12] Yeah.
[1380.58 → 1380.96] All right.
[1381.00 → 1381.92] Let's move on to.
[1382.20 → 1382.86] Our next topic.
[1383.38 → 1383.78] Um.
[1383.86 → 1384.22] So yeah.
[1384.32 → 1385.68] They're seizing LCD production.
[1385.94 → 1386.90] But it's not a big deal.
[1386.90 → 1388.12] Because they're still going to make.
[1388.92 → 1389.36] Displays.
[1389.48 → 1390.24] They're just going to be.
[1390.24 → 1391.26] Ones that they can, actually.
[1391.26 → 1392.06] Make margin on.
[1392.18 → 1392.36] And that.
[1392.96 → 1393.40] Push.
[1393.50 → 1394.24] Push things forward.
[1394.72 → 1395.40] And micro lead.
[1395.56 → 1396.86] Is where I'm really excited.
[1396.96 → 1397.46] The good news is.
[1397.50 → 1398.02] They've got.
[1398.36 → 1398.60] You know.
[1398.68 → 1399.42] Five years.
[1399.66 → 1400.40] To eight years.
[1400.56 → 1401.34] While all the people.
[1401.46 → 1402.32] That are still rocking.
[1402.78 → 1403.04] You know.
[1403.10 → 1404.54] Early generation LCDs.
[1404.60 → 1405.86] Get through their upgrade cycle.
[1406.42 → 1406.82] Um.
[1406.82 → 1407.46] But I don't.
[1407.54 → 1408.84] I think at the enthusiast level.
[1408.94 → 1409.66] There's not going to be much.
[1409.74 → 1410.62] To incentivize people.
[1410.68 → 1411.48] Past what we have now.
[1411.92 → 1412.34] All right.
[1412.34 → 1414.36] Let's talk about the 10th gen mobile processor.
[1414.50 → 1414.82] Shall we?
[1415.52 → 1415.88] Yes.
[1416.00 → 1417.42] This was posted by William CLL.
[1417.48 → 1417.98] On the forum.
[1418.48 → 1420.02] And we've basically got.
[1420.28 → 1420.68] Graphs.
[1420.68 → 1421.56] Of how much better.
[1421.64 → 1422.54] The new generation is.
[1422.58 → 1424.48] Compared to a three-year-old processor.
[1424.90 → 1427.24] The i7 7820HK.
[1427.32 → 1427.96] In games.
[1428.52 → 1428.84] Now.
[1429.00 → 1429.34] The notes.
[1429.48 → 1430.72] Say that there are graphs.
[1431.48 → 1431.96] Um.
[1433.64 → 1434.08] So.
[1435.12 → 1435.52] Hopefully.
[1435.72 → 1436.94] I will find them.
[1437.50 → 1438.90] Is that what this is?
[1438.96 → 1439.20] Did.
[1440.00 → 1440.26] Oh.
[1440.34 → 1440.60] Okay.
[1440.70 → 1440.90] Yeah.
[1440.96 → 1441.20] Sure.
[1441.32 → 1441.94] I guess.
[1442.14 → 1442.52] Oh boy.
[1442.60 → 1442.92] Do I have.
[1443.04 → 1443.20] Oh.
[1443.26 → 1443.82] And you're dead.
[1444.18 → 1444.58] Luke.
[1444.62 → 1445.20] Are you still there?
[1445.82 → 1446.70] You don't see.
[1446.90 → 1447.88] You don't see the.
[1448.00 → 1448.46] The screen?
[1448.60 → 1448.78] Oh.
[1448.96 → 1449.16] Oh.
[1449.30 → 1449.50] Hey.
[1449.60 → 1450.14] Look at that.
[1450.22 → 1450.40] Yes.
[1450.42 → 1450.78] I do.
[1450.88 → 1451.28] Can you.
[1452.32 → 1453.42] Shovel of it a little bit.
[1453.48 → 1454.06] To the right.
[1454.86 → 1455.88] Is there a way for you to do that?
[1457.06 → 1457.70] You know what?
[1457.76 → 1457.90] No.
[1457.96 → 1458.52] Don't worry about it.
[1458.56 → 1459.20] Don't worry about it.
[1459.92 → 1460.16] No.
[1460.22 → 1460.30] No.
[1460.36 → 1461.00] Don't worry about it.
[1461.00 → 1461.42] It's good enough.
[1461.52 → 1461.78] All right.
[1461.82 → 1462.00] Cool.
[1462.32 → 1464.66] So you want to scroll us down to those performance graphs there?
[1466.46 → 1466.82] Yeah.
[1467.52 → 1467.76] Hey.
[1467.84 → 1468.40] There they are.
[1468.46 → 1468.86] Look at that.
[1468.92 → 1469.20] Okay.
[1469.20 → 1469.28] Okay.
[1469.70 → 1477.42] So Intel estimates that the gaming advantage compared to a three-year-old laptop.
[1477.66 → 1477.82] Now.
[1478.68 → 1479.52] Wait a second.
[1479.84 → 1485.36] Are they factoring in that this new laptop is going to have a better GPU in it?
[1485.36 → 1485.80] Wait.
[1489.30 → 1489.88] Where's the.
[1490.10 → 1490.38] Wait.
[1490.44 → 1492.94] What is the three-year-old laptop they're comparing against?
[1493.06 → 1493.18] Now.
[1493.26 → 1493.60] Just a.
[1493.92 → 1494.58] Just a.
[1494.78 → 1497.74] Just a gosh darn moment here.
[1497.74 → 1498.98] Okay.
[1498.98 → 1499.38] Uh.
[1499.38 → 1499.50] Uh.
[1499.86 → 1500.18] Okay.
[1500.50 → 1505.46] Usually Intel is pretty good about having like the configuration of the systems that they're
[1505.46 → 1505.94] using.
[1506.58 → 1507.06] Uh.
[1507.06 → 1509.46] Listed somewhere at the bottom of these claims.
[1509.56 → 1509.74] You know.
[1509.80 → 1511.68] With all the little asterisks and stuff.
[1511.68 → 1512.50] I don't see it.
[1512.60 → 1512.82] Yeah.
[1513.10 → 1514.10] I don't see anything.
[1514.18 → 1514.28] Oh.
[1514.36 → 1514.50] Wait.
[1514.56 → 1518.02] Maybe on the 10th gen core mobile processors slide.
[1519.96 → 1520.36] Uh.
[1520.88 → 1521.28] No.
[1521.44 → 1522.62] I don't see the specs here.
[1522.72 → 1523.08] All right.
[1523.16 → 1523.38] Well.
[1523.52 → 1524.28] At any rate.
[1524.70 → 1525.12] Um.
[1525.12 → 1525.90] There's the lineup.
[1526.18 → 1528.76] So at the top end you've got the 10980HK.
[1528.84 → 1530.32] That is an overclockable chip.
[1530.46 → 1532.46] Although good freaking luck.
[1533.02 → 1533.38] Uh.
[1533.38 → 1535.10] That's base clock 2.4.
[1535.20 → 1538.40] Max single core turbo of 5.3.
[1539.20 → 1540.94] That is pretty nuts.
[1541.38 → 1544.24] Then you've got the i7-10875H.
[1544.36 → 1544.54] Oh yeah.
[1544.60 → 1546.16] That is an 8 core 16 thread processor.
[1546.50 → 1548.98] This next one down is also 45 watts.
[1548.98 → 1550.14] Um.
[1550.44 → 1550.88] Also.
[1551.68 → 1552.12] Uh.
[1552.22 → 1553.36] 8 core 16 thread.
[1553.56 → 1555.38] And it turbos up to 5.1.
[1555.44 → 1557.08] With a base clock of 2.3.
[1557.58 → 1558.44] Moving right on down.
[1558.52 → 1559.64] We've got a couple of 6 cores.
[1559.76 → 1561.92] I think that 10850H.
[1562.18 → 1562.44] Uh.
[1562.44 → 1563.50] Could be a fascinating one.
[1563.54 → 1564.22] So that 6 cores.
[1564.32 → 1564.98] 45 watts.
[1565.08 → 1566.80] 5.1 maximum single core turbo.
[1567.30 → 1568.74] That one's pretty interesting to me.
[1568.80 → 1570.72] That 2.7 gigahertz all core boost.
[1570.96 → 1571.44] All core.
[1571.64 → 1571.84] Uh.
[1572.14 → 1572.32] Yeah.
[1572.62 → 1572.90] Base.
[1573.12 → 1574.82] Or that 2.7 base is pretty nice.
[1575.04 → 1576.32] And then you move down into.
[1576.44 → 1577.56] We've got another 6 core.
[1577.72 → 1578.52] That's also an i7.
[1578.52 → 1581.00] And then the i's are both quad-core 8 thread.
[1581.08 → 1584.84] But these are all 45 watt TDP processors.
[1584.84 → 1587.40] Which basically tells us right out of the gate.
[1587.96 → 1590.22] That the compete level.
[1591.22 → 1594.38] With AMD's 4th gen Ry zen Mobile.
[1594.94 → 1596.00] Is just.
[1597.04 → 1597.40] It's good.
[1597.46 → 1598.28] This is going to be tough.
[1598.48 → 1600.08] This is going to be an uphill battle.
[1600.58 → 1601.00] And yeah.
[1601.06 → 1602.40] They've got fancy slides in here.
[1602.46 → 1604.70] Talking about up to 54% more FPS.
[1605.50 → 1605.86] Uh.
[1605.86 → 1607.12] Versus a 3-year-old PC.
[1607.12 → 1607.72] But like.
[1608.12 → 1610.28] If you are conveniently leaving out.
[1610.54 → 1613.52] And conveniently comparing to a 3-year-old PC.
[1613.52 → 1614.80] Versus a 2-year-old one.
[1614.96 → 1618.60] Because the 2-year-old one would be equipped with a very similar graphics card.
[1618.92 → 1619.30] Like you are.
[1619.38 → 1621.46] If you're ignoring the graphics card upgrades.
[1621.56 → 1623.32] That have taken place over the last couple of years.
[1623.32 → 1626.22] You are really reaching.
[1627.44 → 1629.06] So a question I have for you.
[1629.36 → 1629.64] Yes.
[1629.70 → 1630.52] Is in the.
[1630.58 → 1632.04] In the time of this.
[1632.48 → 1633.42] COVID stuff.
[1633.56 → 1634.00] And there's.
[1634.14 → 1635.10] There's stuff going around.
[1635.20 → 1636.12] That this might last.
[1636.38 → 1637.00] A couple.
[1637.14 → 1638.10] Or a few more months.
[1638.10 → 1638.84] Or who knows.
[1639.42 → 1639.74] Yeah.
[1639.74 → 1639.90] Um.
[1641.14 → 1641.58] Laptop.
[1642.54 → 1643.58] Purchase and investment.
[1644.10 → 1644.74] What do you think?
[1646.08 → 1646.48] Huh.
[1646.62 → 1647.50] Because when I saw this.
[1647.56 → 1647.76] I'm like.
[1647.84 → 1648.16] Okay.
[1648.26 → 1648.70] So they are.
[1648.70 → 1650.52] They're launching a new mobile processor.
[1650.72 → 1651.54] But I wonder what the.
[1651.92 → 1653.82] What the market for mobile stuff is going to be.
[1653.82 → 1655.00] I could kind of.
[1655.26 → 1656.28] See arguments.
[1656.44 → 1657.48] Potentially for both.
[1657.68 → 1660.38] A higher interest in buying something mobile.
[1660.38 → 1662.44] And a lower interest in buying something mobile.
[1662.78 → 1664.36] You now have more people.
[1664.36 → 1666.46] With the prospect of potentially working from home.
[1666.86 → 1667.96] You can get.
[1668.30 → 1669.44] Kind of nicer experiences.
[1669.44 → 1670.36] For working from home.
[1670.46 → 1671.06] Out of a desktop.
[1671.62 → 1672.50] That being said.
[1672.58 → 1674.18] If you need to invest in a computer.
[1674.66 → 1677.00] Investing a computer that you can take back to work.
[1677.18 → 1678.08] Or back to school.
[1678.30 → 1679.08] Or whatever else.
[1679.40 → 1680.88] When those organizations.
[1681.32 → 1682.02] Open up again.
[1682.56 → 1683.14] Might be.
[1683.14 → 1684.38] Kind of the play.
[1684.68 → 1686.24] Let's get into that topic in a minute.
[1686.34 → 1687.56] Because I just checked the notes.
[1687.98 → 1688.66] And yes.
[1688.76 → 1689.36] In fact.
[1690.18 → 1691.42] The comparable.
[1693.04 → 1693.48] System.
[1693.48 → 1694.88] That they're comparing against.
[1695.84 → 1697.14] The three-year-old laptop.
[1697.14 → 1698.24] Has a GTX 1080.
[1698.46 → 1700.28] And the new one has an RTX 2080.
[1701.80 → 1703.80] And the source for that information.
[1704.24 → 1704.56] Is.
[1705.56 → 1705.68] Alex.
[1705.84 → 1706.80] One Alex Clark.
[1707.20 → 1707.46] From.
[1708.14 → 1709.26] Linus Tech Tips.
[1709.38 → 1710.16] It's a YouTube channel.
[1710.42 → 1711.08] You might have heard of.
[1711.84 → 1713.12] On a conference call.
[1713.14 → 1713.84] With Intel.
[1714.18 → 1715.18] About these processors.
[1715.18 → 1716.58] So that seems like a pretty good.
[1716.68 → 1717.68] Pretty good source.
[1718.34 → 1719.98] Well that's pretty silly data then.
[1721.30 → 1721.74] Ouch.
[1722.30 → 1724.38] So he's got some speculation in here.
[1724.50 → 1725.76] Will these be able to beat.
[1725.98 → 1727.00] The new Ry zen 9.
[1727.14 → 1727.46] He says.
[1727.60 → 1728.40] This is a guess.
[1728.40 → 1729.02] In all caps.
[1729.46 → 1730.44] Probably in performance.
[1730.52 → 1731.18] He's probably right.
[1731.56 → 1732.26] But it'll take.
[1732.66 → 1733.46] A huge laptop.
[1733.46 → 1734.68] With much more cooling.
[1734.92 → 1735.82] And this is also a guess.
[1735.92 → 1736.74] But probably.
[1736.92 → 1737.64] A correct guess.
[1738.36 → 1740.24] So there are loads of new premium laptops.
[1740.24 → 1741.18] Coming out with these.
[1741.48 → 1742.82] So we'll be interested to see.
[1743.18 → 1743.22] If.
[1745.22 → 1745.70] If.
[1746.20 → 1747.64] If they hold up.
[1748.04 → 1749.08] You can expect reviews.
[1749.20 → 1749.54] For sure.
[1750.08 → 1750.38] All right.
[1750.42 → 1751.16] Let's change gears.
[1751.30 → 1752.10] And let's talk about.
[1752.30 → 1753.20] Whether now.
[1753.20 → 1754.24] Is the right time.
[1754.24 → 1755.30] To buy a laptop.
[1755.30 → 1756.20] Or a desktop.
[1756.96 → 1757.74] After this message.
[1757.74 → 1758.46] From our sponsors.
[1759.14 → 1759.58] Back blaze.
[1759.58 → 1759.86] Perfect.
[1760.20 → 1760.58] Yeah.
[1760.70 → 1761.20] I got them.
[1761.44 → 1761.54] Got them.
[1761.54 → 1761.98] Beautiful.
[1762.46 → 1763.10] More at 11.
[1763.86 → 1765.08] Back blaze is an unlimited.
[1765.34 → 1766.54] Cloud backup for Macs.
[1766.60 → 1767.36] And PCs.
[1767.58 → 1768.60] For just $6 a month.
[1768.78 → 1770.40] They've got over 35 billion.
[1770.56 → 1771.42] Files restored.
[1771.86 → 1772.54] You can back up.
[1772.60 → 1772.88] Docs.
[1772.92 → 1773.26] Music.
[1773.58 → 1774.06] Photos.
[1774.36 → 1774.80] Videos.
[1774.94 → 1775.28] Drawings.
[1775.38 → 1775.86] Projects.
[1775.92 → 1776.74] All the data.
[1776.84 → 1777.24] Basically.
[1777.34 → 1777.88] That's what it says.
[1777.92 → 1778.98] That is in my talking points.
[1779.22 → 1780.06] All the data.
[1780.52 → 1782.04] You can restore files from anywhere.
[1782.24 → 1783.00] Download them directly.
[1783.00 → 1783.44] On the web.
[1783.50 → 1784.64] Or you can restore by mail.
[1784.78 → 1785.70] So if you do it by mail.
[1785.70 → 1786.34] They will, actually.
[1786.48 → 1788.06] Overnight FedEx you a hard drive.
[1788.14 → 1788.78] Full of your data.
[1788.96 → 1790.06] You can offload everything.
[1790.16 → 1790.80] Send it back to them.
[1790.88 → 1792.32] And they will refund you for the drive.
[1792.68 → 1793.22] Cool stuff.
[1793.26 → 1793.44] Right?
[1793.60 → 1794.76] No wonky cost structure.
[1794.96 → 1796.42] And I believe this was.
[1796.54 → 1797.90] I thought this was Back blaze.
[1799.48 → 1800.32] One second.
[1802.50 → 1804.38] I thought I saw news about this.
[1805.08 → 1805.40] Yes.
[1805.84 → 1807.40] March 23rd.
[1807.40 → 1808.08] 2020.
[1808.84 → 1810.60] Back blaze reached one exabyte.
[1811.18 → 1811.70] Of data.
[1813.36 → 1813.72] Nerds.
[1814.28 → 1814.64] Nerds.
[1814.64 → 1814.88] Nerds.
[1814.88 → 1817.28] So for a fully featured 15 day free trial.
[1817.42 → 1819.10] Go to backblaze.com slash when.
[1819.34 → 1820.06] It's not that I'm salty.
[1820.12 → 1821.52] Because I have not as much.
[1821.60 → 1822.66] It's not a measuring contest.
[1822.78 → 1822.94] Okay?
[1823.24 → 1824.50] It's just that they're nerds.
[1824.50 → 1825.92] So go play with it.
[1826.14 → 1828.96] And start protecting yourself from potential bad times.
[1828.96 → 1830.86] To buy private internet access.
[1831.36 → 1833.26] What's in your online security toolkit?
[1833.58 → 1834.18] Not PIA?
[1834.42 → 1835.38] Well then get PIA.
[1835.80 → 1837.76] Adding a VPN lets you mask your IP.
[1838.22 → 1840.78] And it encrypts traffic to and from your devices.
[1841.30 → 1845.36] PIA has reliable service with over 3,300 servers in 30 countries.
[1845.56 → 1847.08] And they now feature WireGuard.
[1847.20 → 1848.06] Which isn't a beta state.
[1848.18 → 1849.38] But they've got WireGuard now.
[1849.82 → 1850.96] There's no bandwidth caps.
[1851.30 → 1852.96] And you can configure your encryption.
[1853.38 → 1854.94] And you can set up your internet kill switch.
[1855.00 → 1857.26] So it's not going to allow any data through.
[1857.32 → 1859.50] If your VPN becomes disconnected for whatever reason.
[1859.94 → 1861.12] So just get it.
[1861.44 → 1862.82] When combined with private browsing.
[1862.94 → 1865.74] It can even make websites think you're in a different country.
[1865.74 → 1867.32] It's risk-free to try.
[1867.46 → 1869.00] With their 30-day money-back guarantee.
[1869.22 → 1870.96] And you can connect up to five devices at once.
[1871.04 → 1873.48] With clients for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.
[1873.84 → 1874.64] So think about it.
[1874.74 → 1879.68] No matter how diverse your group of tech nerd friends is.
[1880.18 → 1882.36] You could all install PIA.
[1884.70 → 1886.28] And I'm not going to say that you could do it.
[1886.32 → 1886.94] All of you.
[1887.04 → 1888.68] On one device each with one account.
[1890.48 → 1891.18] But you could.
[1891.68 → 1895.52] I love that PIA just like doesn't even look at the spots that we do for them.
[1895.52 → 1896.86] I'm sure they'd get mad about that one.
[1896.94 → 1897.30] But whatever.
[1897.78 → 1898.98] The point is got PIA.
[1899.20 → 1900.04] It's affordable.
[1900.34 → 1902.38] LEG.GG slash PIA when.
[1902.80 → 1903.12] All right.
[1903.14 → 1906.42] Now I really want to talk about that thing that you were going to talk about.
[1907.32 → 1908.40] Desktop or laptop.
[1908.88 → 1909.72] Because of the COVID thing.
[1909.82 → 1910.74] I want you to go first though.
[1910.90 → 1911.18] Hit me.
[1912.30 → 1914.24] I kind of always vote this way.
[1914.56 → 1914.66] You're biased.
[1915.28 → 1915.52] Yeah.
[1915.70 → 1916.10] You're biased.
[1916.72 → 1916.90] Yeah.
[1917.08 → 1917.24] Okay.
[1917.28 → 1917.92] Try to be unbiased.
[1917.92 → 1918.16] I like desktops.
[1918.18 → 1918.50] Try again.
[1919.22 → 1920.60] I'm pretty into desktops.
[1920.72 → 1922.84] I think now would be the time to go in for a desktop.
[1923.08 → 1923.64] You think so?
[1924.18 → 1924.48] Yeah.
[1924.48 → 1925.82] You know what?
[1926.58 → 1926.98] Man.
[1927.10 → 1927.66] It's tough.
[1928.12 → 1928.26] Okay.
[1928.32 → 1929.02] You're stuck at home.
[1929.20 → 1934.48] If you've never built a computer before, you probably have time for projects.
[1934.48 → 1938.96] Whether you're able to fit in building a computer in that project, I don't know.
[1939.02 → 1940.44] But you probably have time for projects.
[1940.80 → 1942.36] You could dive into building a computer now.
[1942.86 → 1945.86] There are a bunch of nerds also stuck at home.
[1946.56 → 1947.18] Probably help you.
[1947.18 → 1953.46] If you have a phone, you would be able to show a video.
[1954.30 → 1958.50] You could do a video call with someone and show like most people are for work and stuff
[1958.50 → 1961.42] these days and show them exactly what's going on and get it fixed.
[1961.48 → 1961.98] No problem.
[1962.10 → 1963.20] I'm sure there's going to be no issue there.
[1963.28 → 1968.70] And then you'll have the premium experience during the duration of the quarantine.
[1969.26 → 1969.36] Yeah.
[1969.36 → 1970.22] I think that's pretty cool.
[1970.22 → 1971.04] I think that's fair.
[1971.16 → 1973.00] You're leaning a little bit to your right there.
[1973.20 → 1973.46] Sorry.
[1973.60 → 1973.90] There we go.
[1973.98 → 1974.14] Yep.
[1974.18 → 1974.78] That's a little better.
[1974.88 → 1975.32] Thanks, Luke.
[1975.48 → 1981.06] But then I can also fully understand the argument of like, I need to get a computer for the home,
[1981.06 → 1984.82] but I won't really use it in my home once quarantine stuff is over.
[1984.82 → 1991.50] And having one that you could take with you to your work or to your school or wherever you need to go.
[1992.50 → 1994.28] So that's why I'm torn.
[1994.48 → 1998.82] Because on the one hand, it is a great time to build a desktop.
[1998.82 → 2002.88] So we did a machine on live stream earlier today, actually.
[2003.00 → 2006.58] I built a machine that, let me just check the specs of it.
[2006.70 → 2008.74] But it was like $800.
[2009.66 → 2012.76] They accidentally, the RGB one was actually not included in the $800.
[2013.38 → 2013.58] Oops.
[2013.58 → 2015.16] So that was my bad.
[2015.48 → 2016.16] But hold on.
[2016.18 → 2017.08] Let me just have a look here.
[2017.80 → 2020.28] Either way, that's a few bucks' adder.
[2020.32 → 2021.92] And you don't have to buy that one if you don't want.
[2022.08 → 2023.92] So Ry zen 5 3600X.
[2023.94 → 2026.64] That is a six core processor with great performance.
[2026.64 → 2032.56] That is basically as high as you need to go to play any game on the market with any graphics card.
[2033.16 → 2034.50] I mean, you can go higher if you want.
[2034.80 → 2037.66] And then you can, you know, video encode for days or whatever.
[2038.06 → 2039.64] But that is a great chip.
[2040.26 → 2043.22] Decent As rock B450 board that supports everything you need.
[2043.22 → 2049.44] As long as you're not trying to run SLI or like, you know, fancy 10 gigabits per second front panel USB or anything like that.
[2049.50 → 2050.94] It's got everything you really need.
[2051.60 → 2054.28] It's got 16 gigs of RAM.
[2054.36 → 2058.14] I think we put two sticks of these 8 gig DDR4-3200s in there.
[2058.14 → 2060.52] 512 gig M.2 SSD.
[2060.84 → 2062.14] The RTX 2060 KO.
[2062.46 → 2065.82] So that's the cool one that's using the same GPU as the 2070.
[2066.40 → 2069.06] And so has a bit better performance in compute applications.
[2069.60 → 2070.32] Decent case.
[2070.42 → 2071.14] 500 watt.
[2071.24 → 2072.84] 80 plus gold VGA power supply.
[2072.96 → 2073.96] That is a good system.
[2074.26 → 2075.08] For $800.
[2076.04 → 2078.02] You could throw a cheap monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
[2078.14 → 2080.24] And you are ready to go for under a grand.
[2080.96 → 2082.74] So that's fantastic.
[2082.74 → 2088.22] Because the reality of it is, I don't know what it is, but somehow laptops just seem to slow down over time, don't they?
[2088.68 → 2088.90] Oh, yeah.
[2088.90 → 2093.70] And there's nothing scientific that I can find to back up, to back it up.
[2093.92 → 2096.80] But like, they just, they were fast and then they feel slow.
[2096.98 → 2097.84] I don't get it.
[2098.26 → 2099.90] And they just, they seem to die faster.
[2100.14 → 2102.38] Like, that's been my experience with them in general.
[2102.38 → 2103.50] They definitely die faster.
[2103.88 → 2104.08] Yeah.
[2104.42 → 2110.54] I mean, my girlfriend is still using my old 2600K GTX 780 setup.
[2110.92 → 2114.22] Oh, there's no way you're running a laptop from that era and having a good experience.
[2114.74 → 2114.92] No.
[2115.18 → 2117.92] And it's, and her experience is totally fine.
[2118.78 → 2119.18] Okay.
[2119.50 → 2123.96] But let me give you the counterpoint to that argument.
[2124.18 → 2124.44] Okay.
[2124.50 → 2125.18] Let me just see.
[2125.18 → 2127.40] I need to check pricing on this one real quick here.
[2127.40 → 2133.32] We also did a video this week on the Zephyrus G14.
[2134.20 → 2136.96] Let me just see if that one is, is up yet.
[2137.10 → 2138.78] Ry zen 7 second gen.
[2139.58 → 2140.28] Yeah, no.
[2140.36 → 2145.02] It looks like, it looks like that particular model is not up on New egg yet, unfortunately.
[2146.18 → 2151.72] But that's a laptop with a solid, solid graphics card in it.
[2152.30 → 2156.10] Basically, desktop level gaming performance out of the CPU.
[2157.40 → 2161.52] Um, laptops have also come a long way in terms.
[2161.60 → 2162.06] So here, hold on.
[2162.14 → 2171.00] So RTX 2060, it's got, um, uh, the Ry zen 9 4900HS, which is just an unbelievable chip.
[2171.08 → 2172.42] Eight cores, 16 threads.
[2172.50 → 2177.02] It turbos up to 4.3 gigahertz, which on AMD's architecture is awesome.
[2177.74 → 2180.34] 512 gigs of storage, 14 inch display.
[2180.34 → 2182.50] Uh, you can get a high refresh rate one.
[2182.58 → 2185.04] So you can get a 120 hertz display.
[2185.80 → 2188.78] Um, for what is more money.
[2188.96 → 2189.22] Yes.
[2189.90 → 2191.38] That is a great experience.
[2191.38 → 2196.16] And if you hooked it up to an external monitor, and you're willing to live that dongle life
[2196.16 → 2201.54] when you, when you sit with it at your desk, there is so much high speed IO on a laptop
[2201.54 → 2205.00] these days that you can do basically whatever you want to do.
[2205.16 → 2207.00] I streamed WAN show last week.
[2207.02 → 2212.46] It wasn't pleasant because I didn't have the ergonomics sorted out, but I streamed WAN show
[2212.46 → 2216.66] last week with multiple sources off of an ultra book.
[2216.92 → 2217.38] Yep.
[2217.56 → 2219.42] And that was one that was only a six core.
[2219.42 → 2221.48] And it was an Intel one.
[2221.54 → 2224.64] That's not as powerful as this new Ry zen processor, which is an eight core.
[2224.80 → 2226.78] And you can get in like a slim laptop.
[2226.90 → 2229.74] There's something to be said for being able to take the performance with you.
[2229.86 → 2229.96] Yes.
[2229.98 → 2236.08] It's less on the go and be able to use the same machine, both at work and at home.
[2236.48 → 2236.88] Absolutely.
[2237.00 → 2241.18] And in terms of dongle expansion, you could even just go with one of the like Amazon basics
[2241.18 → 2247.02] desktop USB three extension, uh, not extension, uh, expansion.
[2247.02 → 2250.24] I don't know, but it like powers itself through the wall.
[2250.24 → 2253.54] So it's able to deliver full power to all the USB ports.
[2253.54 → 2256.98] It's, it's actually really nice, and it's like 30 bucks or something.
[2257.38 → 2261.94] Um, and then you don't actually really have to deal with all these short kind of dangle
[2261.94 → 2264.70] annoying dongles because you can place that wherever you want.
[2264.70 → 2266.94] I just, yeah, sorry.
[2267.90 → 2274.58] I, I, I think, yeah, if you have a very strong argument for the mobility of the computer down
[2274.58 → 2277.86] the line when we're out of quarantine, that's its own thing.
[2277.86 → 2282.12] I just think right now is especially a strong argument for building a desktop.
[2282.80 → 2284.48] I, I, I don't think you're wrong.
[2284.66 → 2287.80] I mean, the desktop is going to be more upgradable in the long-term.
[2287.80 → 2293.20] It's just that we also happen to be going through a big leap forward in performance for
[2293.20 → 2295.94] notebooks at this very moment right now.
[2296.72 → 2300.18] So it's just, it's a good time to get a computer, you know, you know what I'm talking
[2300.18 → 2300.44] about?
[2300.44 → 2303.02] Um, all right.
[2303.16 → 2308.06] There's all those crazy amount of people that have started playing, uh, computer games.
[2308.34 → 2312.58] The, the stats out of like steam and Twitch and all this kind of stuff is crazy over the
[2312.58 → 2313.24] last few weeks.
[2313.24 → 2315.16] Hey, even I got a streaming setup.
[2315.56 → 2317.30] I want to stream some Anna this weekend.
[2318.12 → 2320.58] I've got like the I've got like the key lights and everything.
[2320.88 → 2322.40] Like you, you can't see it.
[2322.44 → 2326.84] I look pretty crappy on your feed just because I'm, I've got a webcam at about 10 FPS.
[2326.84 → 2332.06] I'm moving my head back and forth and Luke's feed looks hilariously bad, but, uh, I've
[2332.06 → 2333.68] got a DSLR that I'm using for the WAN show.
[2333.72 → 2336.48] It actually looks in my opinion, quite, quite crisp.
[2336.92 → 2337.32] Yeah.
[2337.32 → 2342.14] I can see it on, I, I have, uh, the Twitch and float plane and YouTube streams all
[2342.14 → 2342.40] up.
[2342.84 → 2344.66] Because I'm on my desktop at home desktop.
[2344.84 → 2347.20] It wouldn't matter because you could plug monitors into a laptop, whatever.
[2347.34 → 2347.94] Don't worry about it.
[2347.94 → 2350.84] But, but I have lots of monitor space.
[2350.96 → 2352.10] So I can just put everything everywhere.
[2352.48 → 2353.48] And you know what?
[2353.50 → 2357.70] That's another thing too, is like laptop IO has come a long way.
[2357.74 → 2361.04] I talk a lot about how great Thunderbolt is, but you don't even need Thunderbolt.
[2361.46 → 2365.80] Like a USB 10 gigabit per second, 10 gigabits per second.
[2366.36 → 2367.80] That is a lot of data.
[2367.98 → 2372.56] You could have a couple of capture cards running off of a single one of those ports.
[2372.56 → 2374.46] No problem at all.
[2375.74 → 2377.80] So yeah, something to be said both ways.
[2378.22 → 2383.72] Uh, on the subject of laptops, um, this was one of Colin's suggestions for topics today.
[2383.80 → 2388.02] Racer released a new blade 15 with a 300 Hertz display.
[2388.24 → 2392.48] So that's full HD, or you can get an OLED 4k touchscreen.
[2392.48 → 2397.88] If you prefer that, uh, it's got HDR 400 certification on the OLED panel, man, HDR and laptops.
[2397.88 → 2404.24] We needed OLED to come for that to happen just because you can't do it on an LCD without full array local dimming.
[2404.30 → 2405.96] And you'd have a laptop that's like this thick.
[2406.54 → 2418.56] Um, I don't want to be, I don't want to be boring, but all of this is like, I don't know, 300 Hertz on a laptop or 4k on a laptop are both things that I would.
[2418.74 → 2419.36] Are you just salty?
[2419.36 → 2420.30] Because you don't have it.
[2420.72 → 2425.22] They're both things I would, uh, definitely not invest my money in.
[2425.22 → 2426.16] You know, okay.
[2426.54 → 2427.58] 4k on a laptop.
[2427.82 → 2429.10] I'm with you a hundred percent.
[2429.16 → 2429.82] Makes no sense.
[2430.30 → 2435.94] 1440p should have been the laptop resolution five years ago, and it should still be the laptop resolution today.
[2436.10 → 2441.30] There is no reason to be pushing those extra pixels on a 14 inch, 15 inch device.
[2441.48 → 2442.32] It makes no sense.
[2442.84 → 2446.58] Um, as for 300 Hertz, why not?
[2447.80 → 2449.86] I'm not, it's not the worst thing.
[2449.92 → 2451.30] I just don't want to spend my money on it.
[2451.30 → 2459.70] So I was surprised when we did the test with, uh, Corey shroud and, um, and with Grams.
[2460.00 → 2466.40] Um, I was surprised because I always thought going from 60 to 120 was night and day.
[2466.40 → 2470.06] And then past there, it was kind of like point of diminishing returns.
[2470.06 → 2481.98] But the amount of improvement that we saw once we were measuring it empirically from those guys, even going up to 240 Hertz was noticeable.
[2482.26 → 2487.12] So I would be interested to see, do they actually get another, maybe it's just 10%.
[2487.12 → 2489.00] Maybe it's just 8% better.
[2489.18 → 2494.76] But when you're talking competitive gaming, I would take 8% any day of the week.
[2494.76 → 2497.04] I just, I would take anything I can get.
[2497.12 → 2499.44] Because I suck, but that's a whole conversation.
[2499.62 → 2500.04] Me too.
[2500.46 → 2501.62] Oh, shut up.
[2502.02 → 2502.90] Shut up now.
[2503.46 → 2505.18] No, I refuse to talk.
[2505.30 → 2506.60] We're no longer on speaking terms.
[2506.72 → 2508.96] So this is going to be a really awkward rest of the WAN show.
[2514.06 → 2521.80] I, yeah, I just like how you're talking really high-end competitive gaming.
[2521.80 → 2524.12] I don't know how much of that happens on a laptop.
[2525.64 → 2526.92] I'm sure some does.
[2527.82 → 2538.64] I know people that have been super, super into gaming that played on a laptop, but like that being their, their main system seems like maybe a little bit of a stretch to me personally.
[2540.50 → 2542.30] But I don't know.
[2542.70 → 2546.06] It's cool to have those, uh, options for people.
[2546.06 → 2548.72] I guess it's just very notably not for me.
[2548.72 → 2551.78] If I want to really try hard at a game, I'll sit down at a desktop.
[2554.86 → 2557.80] You're really showing off your, uh, your Corona beard here.
[2560.96 → 2563.78] I never told Luke that I wouldn't talk to you guys.
[2563.84 → 2567.02] So I'm going to talk on the show, just not to him.
[2567.62 → 2570.10] I've got another great topic to tell you guys about here.
[2570.10 → 2574.34] So 8,400 megahertz Ram is now coming.
[2574.46 → 2577.26] DDR5 mass production starts this year.
[2577.36 → 2582.44] So we began the transition from DDR3 to DDR4 six years ago.
[2582.70 → 2584.10] Wrap your brain around that.
[2584.70 → 2587.88] Six years ago, the transition began.
[2587.88 → 2592.90] And now memory suppliers are finally laying the groundwork for the leap from DDR4 to DDR5.
[2592.98 → 2594.58] Now DDR4 has gotten better.
[2594.72 → 2595.50] It's gotten faster.
[2595.60 → 2600.34] The latencies have gotten better that it has definitely been refined in that time.
[2600.60 → 2605.28] But, uh, we have not had a generational leap forward in quite some time, ladies and gentlemen.
[2605.94 → 2607.22] So it makes so much sense.
[2607.58 → 2609.10] I, Jaden asked me.
[2609.10 → 2611.50] Sorry, guys, can you hear something right now?
[2612.70 → 2613.86] I'm not going to go into why.
[2614.04 → 2617.14] But Jaden asked me for a graphics card and some RAM.
[2617.28 → 2618.48] And I was able to hook him up.
[2618.74 → 2621.24] And I asked him, like, do you need DDR3 or DDR4?
[2621.84 → 2627.36] And he kind of paused for a second as in, like, what do you even mean?
[2627.68 → 2629.18] And then was like, DDR4?
[2629.56 → 2630.70] And I was like, well, I don't know.
[2631.18 → 2634.60] But, yeah, I guess no one really needs that.
[2634.60 → 2641.92] But SK Hynix is claiming that DDR5 will ultimately offer twice the bandwidth currently available with DDR4 modules.
[2642.62 → 2648.50] So the current DDR4 modules top out, well, the DEX certified ones top out at 3200 MHz.
[2648.58 → 2650.52] Although you can definitely get ones that go faster.
[2651.72 → 2656.90] So there will be a 50% boost in bandwidth, meaning that DDR5 4800 should be commonplace.
[2656.98 → 2658.18] But speeds will ramp up from there.
[2658.18 → 2662.38] And they claim they'll reach up to DDR5 8400 MHz in the future.
[2662.38 → 2667.46] The modules will operate at just 1.1 volt versus 1.2 volts.
[2667.70 → 2673.26] There will be on-die error correction for more reliable technology node scaling by correcting single-bit errors internally.
[2673.56 → 2674.28] That's pretty sweet.
[2674.78 → 2675.76] 32-bank structure.
[2675.98 → 2679.10] An upgrade from DDR4 16 banks per four bank groups.
[2680.94 → 2683.92] I wonder if that's just for error correcting memory or if that's for everything.
[2685.16 → 2687.42] Burst length of 16 versus 8 for DDR4.
[2688.70 → 2691.96] DDR5 will offer a wide range of density based on 16.
[2691.96 → 2698.74] 16 gigabit and even 24 gigabit monolithic dies in order to meet the needs of cloud service customers.
[2698.88 → 2699.06] Really?
[2699.78 → 2702.62] 24 gigabit dies.
[2703.62 → 2703.94] Huh.
[2704.56 → 2711.46] That's the first time I think I've seen like an oddball die size like that.
[2712.28 → 2715.10] Mass production will begin later this year.
[2715.10 → 2715.70] Cool.
[2719.70 → 2721.12] Sorry, can you guys hear something?
[2721.76 → 2722.18] That's weird.
[2723.20 → 2723.90] I'm over it.
[2723.90 → 2725.26] I really thought you were going to bite on the-
[2725.26 → 2725.72] I'm over it.
[2725.78 → 2726.16] I'm back.
[2726.38 → 2726.84] I'm back.
[2726.98 → 2729.28] I forgive you for claiming to be bad at gaming.
[2729.42 → 2737.12] He is so much better than me that to hear him say that he's bad is basically a direct insult to me.
[2737.12 → 2739.36] Because it means that I must be gutter trash.
[2739.98 → 2743.90] But this whole debate isn't fair either because you just never play games.
[2744.00 → 2746.86] So once you play a game long enough, you're perfect at it.
[2747.00 → 2747.96] No, no.
[2748.10 → 2748.44] Yes.
[2748.70 → 2749.28] I wouldn't be-
[2749.28 → 2750.48] We've proven this a number of times.
[2750.48 → 2752.42] My raw skills are just not enough.
[2752.64 → 2754.02] Not enough to compete, I'm afraid.
[2754.98 → 2755.90] Mind you, I'm pretty sure-
[2755.90 → 2761.98] We played three matches of PUBG when he had never touched the game ever before, and we won two out of our first three.
[2762.12 → 2763.96] Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
[2764.12 → 2764.86] We were playing with Joe.
[2764.86 → 2765.18] Yes, you did.
[2765.64 → 2766.62] I didn't do much.
[2767.08 → 2771.00] I don't remember what the names of the guns are in that game because I haven't played in forever.
[2771.12 → 2778.80] But he had one of the lower damage snipers, and he would always tag people before engages at least once or twice.
[2779.02 → 2780.38] And then we were able to just clean them up.
[2780.44 → 2781.34] That's super valuable.
[2781.46 → 2782.52] You just didn't get the killing blows.
[2782.92 → 2785.00] Yeah, I don't think I got any kills.
[2785.00 → 2786.68] So, yeah, there's that.
[2787.06 → 2788.12] It's fine.
[2788.82 → 2790.10] It's a support role.
[2790.26 → 2790.96] Support role.
[2791.44 → 2794.04] Yeah, that's another way of saying that I'm not good enough to play in the front line.
[2795.16 → 2797.64] I'm definitely better than you at Beat Safer though.
[2797.92 → 2800.66] So, I'm taking that to the bank.
[2801.14 → 2803.04] I've been playing so much.
[2803.10 → 2804.54] I've gotten a lot better too.
[2804.84 → 2810.58] I don't think I'd ever be able to properly compete with you because I don't have that type of wrist movement.
[2810.70 → 2811.88] It's not exactly my forte.
[2812.14 → 2813.30] I was showing Yvonne.
[2813.30 → 2814.96] Yeah, you're more into...
[2814.96 → 2815.40] Sorry.
[2815.52 → 2819.02] I was showing Yvonne how I move my wrists for Beat Safer.
[2819.36 → 2820.56] I was like, yeah, it's got to be...
[2820.56 → 2821.92] You were showing Yvonne how you move your wrist?
[2821.94 → 2822.22] Oh, yeah.
[2822.40 → 2823.44] You got to pronate, right?
[2823.76 → 2824.76] You got to pronate.
[2825.38 → 2831.46] And instead of kind of slicing like this, you know, instead of being like this, you got to slice through like this.
[2831.46 → 2834.10] And she was like, oh.
[2835.04 → 2839.20] And then we actually got from there into working on her badminton swing.
[2839.42 → 2842.06] Because I was like, yeah, it should be just like your badminton swing.
[2842.24 → 2845.08] And she's like, yeah, I'm swinging just like my badminton swing.
[2845.12 → 2846.66] I'm like, oh, well, then your badminton swing is wrong.
[2846.72 → 2847.40] We got to fix that.
[2847.92 → 2850.96] Unfortunately, we can't go anywhere and play because all the gyms are closed.
[2851.74 → 2852.98] So that blows.
[2853.16 → 2855.30] But I'm looking forward to getting back into it.
[2855.40 → 2859.46] My weird little ball thing has shipped now to like to hit against the wall in practice.
[2860.04 → 2861.52] What's the ETA?
[2861.82 → 2862.92] There is no ETA.
[2863.12 → 2866.70] It's shipped via like economy because I wasn't willing to pay $12 or whatever.
[2868.00 → 2868.28] Okay.
[2868.46 → 2868.72] All right.
[2868.78 → 2869.50] Let's talk about...
[2869.50 → 2870.46] This is kind of a big topic.
[2871.38 → 2876.36] Cloudflare is now offering filtering for pornography and malware.
[2877.16 → 2880.06] So this was posted by Tetris guy on the forum.
[2880.06 → 2885.08] And if you're not familiar, Cloudflare has their 1.DNS.
[2885.30 → 2887.22] So 1.1.1.1.
[2887.68 → 2894.84] And they are launching a new product, which is 1.1.1.1 for families,
[2895.16 → 2899.92] offering all the good stuff about 1.1.1.1, which is faster DNS queries.
[2900.68 → 2906.28] But now with filtering for malware and adult content.
[2906.28 → 2912.08] So if you use 1.1.1.2, that'll block malware that they're aware of.
[2912.18 → 2913.38] I mean, obviously, it won't catch everything.
[2913.74 → 2919.42] And if you do 1.1.1.3, it will block malware and adult content.
[2919.56 → 2922.36] Should we try it live on stream?
[2923.36 → 2923.88] No.
[2923.88 → 2924.32] Really?
[2925.66 → 2926.52] You don't want to?
[2927.00 → 2928.12] Part of you is tempted.
[2928.30 → 2928.74] You're tempted.
[2929.28 → 2930.18] You're a little tempted.
[2930.18 → 2932.30] I mean, I'm very interested.
[2932.88 → 2935.84] I'm honestly more interested because I don't really care about the other one.
[2935.94 → 2941.26] I'm more interested in the malware, how they decide something's malware.
[2941.46 → 2941.62] Yep.
[2941.62 → 2947.20] I'm interested in how they decide what adult content is because is it just pornography?
[2947.54 → 2954.06] Like, are we opening up the Pandora's box of internet filtration here?
[2954.06 → 2954.22] Is it banned?
[2955.16 → 2956.04] I doubt it.
[2956.10 → 2957.36] I'm sure Reddit is permitted.
[2957.52 → 2958.18] I doubt it too.
[2958.36 → 2961.16] But like, is Tumblr banned?
[2962.64 → 2965.32] Probably not anymore because I guess they did away with that.
[2965.62 → 2967.04] So here's how it works.
[2967.04 → 2971.72] In the coming months, they'll be launching options to create whitelists and blacklists of certain sites.
[2971.84 → 2976.02] And you'll be able to set the times of day when categories, such as social media, are blocked.
[2976.14 → 2978.72] And you'll be able to get reports on your household's internet usage.
[2978.84 → 2985.46] So this is intended to be something that much like there was a product from, ah, shoot.
[2985.54 → 2986.60] I think it was the Bitdefender box.
[2986.68 → 2986.80] Yeah.
[2986.86 → 2993.58] There was a product from Bitdefender that I showed that you can basically install as your router or in between your router
[2993.58 → 2998.80] and your broader internet connection that would do this kind of filtration and reporting.
[2999.28 → 3007.10] But this is pretty much just being able to do it through your router's DNS settings, which is very, very interesting.
[3007.22 → 3012.44] It uses the same site categorization and filtering technology that powers Cloudflare's gateway product.
[3012.52 → 3013.62] And I'm not that familiar with it.
[3013.62 → 3013.88] Are you?
[3015.02 → 3015.34] No.
[3015.68 → 3015.92] Okay.
[3015.96 → 3016.72] Well, that's unfortunate.
[3018.44 → 3020.48] I mean, they have a lot of different stuff.
[3020.48 → 3024.24] As a parent, man, I could see myself using this.
[3024.46 → 3028.58] Like, just, yeah, kids are always going to be able to get through stuff.
[3029.20 → 3037.40] But making it a little more difficult, like making it a little less convenient, not necessarily a bad thing.
[3038.88 → 3040.34] Yeah, I don't know what gateway is.
[3040.34 → 3045.86] I mean, I could see putting the I could see just using the malware blocker at the office.
[3045.86 → 3050.18] Like, you never know if someone's going to just deep and like accidentally infect the whole place.
[3050.18 → 3050.62] Yep.
[3051.62 → 3053.62] That could be helpful for some things.
[3054.50 → 3067.74] Someone in Twitch chat said apparently the filter, as with other filters, other similar filters in the past, it has issues with LGBT content.
[3068.32 → 3068.78] Yep.
[3070.14 → 3071.26] Inappropriately flagging it.
[3071.34 → 3072.32] So that's interesting.
[3072.50 → 3073.98] Something to maybe pay attention to.
[3073.98 → 3074.74] I don't know.
[3074.82 → 3082.58] It's, it's, when it's not manually done, it's interesting what it's going to catch.
[3082.70 → 3082.94] Yep.
[3083.24 → 3084.56] And what it's not going to catch.
[3084.76 → 3085.88] Powered by lava lamps or whatever.
[3087.16 → 3087.60] Yeah.
[3087.60 → 3090.78] That's what happens when we trust the lava lamps.
[3090.92 → 3091.80] It is very cool.
[3092.32 → 3093.90] We put the lava lamps in charge.
[3095.22 → 3095.54] Yeah.
[3095.84 → 3096.04] Yeah.
[3096.46 → 3096.78] All right.
[3096.78 → 3097.48] We got a couple more.
[3097.48 → 3100.50] If the lava lamps were deciding, I, I, I'm in.
[3100.64 → 3101.20] I'm done.
[3101.38 → 3101.64] All right.
[3101.64 → 3103.26] Do you want to fire up ltdstore.com?
[3103.30 → 3104.90] Because we got a pretty, pretty cool update.
[3106.24 → 3107.66] I'll just go ahead and screen share that.
[3107.66 → 3111.80] So guys, you can join the folding team now with your shirt.
[3112.52 → 3112.84] Woo.
[3113.48 → 3114.32] There it is.
[3116.20 → 3118.04] We've got a folding shirt.
[3118.28 → 3121.72] So the profits from this one, um, not the proceeds.
[3121.86 → 3124.72] We do need to cover the actual costs of the shirts and printing and all that.
[3124.72 → 3128.90] But the profits from these are going to go directly to folding at home efforts.
[3129.12 → 3132.40] Uh, we're not a hundred percent sure what form they're going to take yet.
[3132.80 → 3136.76] Um, it's possible that we will be keeping our folding farm,
[3136.76 → 3141.60] our folding farm, excuse me, our, um, sorry, COVID efforts.
[3141.86 → 3142.02] Ugh.
[3142.40 → 3142.68] Okay.
[3142.70 → 3144.10] They're going towards COVID efforts.
[3144.22 → 3148.32] So it's possible that we're going to keep our 3d printing, uh, face shield farm running
[3148.32 → 3152.30] and actually hire, uh, one of Colin's maker buddies to run that.
[3152.30 → 3156.12] So we could, uh, we could cover some of the costs of running that, whether it's filament
[3156.12 → 3160.84] or a salary for someone to keep that running for as long as operation shields up needs more
[3160.84 → 3161.44] face shields.
[3161.62 → 3166.20] Uh, we might end up donating it directly, whether it's to COVID or folding at home research,
[3166.20 → 3171.18] but basically the commitment from our side is all the profits from the shirts are going
[3171.18 → 3174.18] to fund efforts around COVID-19 research and relief in Canada.
[3174.18 → 3175.96] And this is pretty cool.
[3175.96 → 3181.96] Uh, each dollar raised will be matched towards folding at home directly by Intel up to a maximum
[3181.96 → 3184.06] of 40,000 us dollars.
[3184.76 → 3185.50] That's awesome.
[3185.64 → 3185.96] Thank you.
[3185.98 → 3186.28] Intel.
[3186.46 → 3186.64] Yeah.
[3186.64 → 3189.16] So guys, uh, this item is sold as a pre-order.
[3189.48 → 3192.08] All the shirts will be printed and shipped within three weeks.
[3192.08 → 3196.54] Um, orders, including this shirt, by the way, if you order other stuff with it will not
[3196.54 → 3200.90] be shipped until the shirt is printed so that we don't get billed for shipping twice.
[3201.30 → 3205.28] Um, but yeah, this is just a cool way to rep folding at home.
[3205.46 → 3207.78] Um, rep the LTT folding team.
[3207.88 → 3208.14] Oh yeah.
[3208.18 → 3209.82] I didn't show you guys this, but the back.
[3211.82 → 3212.80] Which side is it on?
[3213.38 → 3215.10] Uh, must be, yeah, this side.
[3215.54 → 3216.22] There it is.
[3216.32 → 3216.56] Yeah.
[3216.76 → 3217.30] Somewhere.
[3217.30 → 3217.96] Yeah, there it is.
[3219.34 → 3220.46] I didn't see anything.
[3220.70 → 3220.82] Yeah.
[3220.82 → 3221.40] There's a QR.
[3221.50 → 3222.74] There's a QR code on the back.
[3223.56 → 3229.96] Um, so if you scan it, it will actually take you to extreme overclocking to the, uh, Linus
[3229.96 → 3231.48] tech tips team stats page.
[3232.42 → 3233.22] That's pretty cool.
[3233.74 → 3236.16] Just like, you know, little, little nerdy things, right?
[3236.24 → 3237.04] Yeah, no, I like that.
[3237.12 → 3237.50] That's cool.
[3238.78 → 3240.86] I just actually want to have a look at our stats guys.
[3240.86 → 3246.48] If you haven't joined the Linus tech tips folding team yet, come on guys, get, get on
[3246.48 → 3251.10] this because we are currently absolutely crushing it.
[3251.62 → 3257.76] So in the last, our 24-hour average is 4 billion points, which is over one and a half billion
[3257.76 → 3260.84] more than the default non-configured team.
[3261.70 → 3263.88] Um, let's see.
[3263.96 → 3268.46] And then after that, it falls off pretty sharply with everyone else under a billion.
[3270.04 → 3272.88] So yeah, we're kind of, we're kind of crushing it.
[3272.98 → 3273.90] So keep it up guys.
[3273.90 → 3277.16] We've got over 50,000 active folders right now.
[3277.18 → 3280.08] And we're looking to, we're looking to move up the ranks here.
[3280.52 → 3281.70] It'd be nice to move up the ranks.
[3281.76 → 3282.62] So let's, let's do it.
[3282.68 → 3283.70] Oh yes.
[3283.78 → 3284.04] Yes.
[3284.10 → 3284.70] Very funny.
[3284.84 → 3285.06] Okay.
[3285.08 → 3285.30] Yes.
[3285.30 → 3290.96] We do also have another merch item that is, that is very hot, very fresh, you know, very,
[3291.16 → 3292.90] very funny, very funny joke.
[3293.00 → 3295.00] Uh, hashtag lie Nuns.
[3295.48 → 3302.00] Uh, Nick insisted that we do just like a simple black shirt with white text, you know,
[3302.00 → 3304.60] like a spread the word type of thing.
[3304.68 → 3307.76] If you guys, this'll be a limited, this'll be a limited run shirt.
[3307.90 → 3310.14] We're never going to bring this back again for sure.
[3310.80 → 3313.60] Um, it's like one of those, haha, very funny joke.
[3313.60 → 3315.54] I remember that I got the shirt.
[3315.86 → 3319.36] Um, but this is not the kind of thing that we're going to have around forever.
[3319.36 → 3327.54] Although if, if, uh, it pains me to say this, if LTX goes ahead this year, I suspect that
[3327.54 → 3331.36] showing up in one of those would be pretty much the cool kids move.
[3333.64 → 3338.28] I was literally thinking like the probably one of the better ways to troll you would be
[3338.28 → 3340.78] wearing one of those and like getting a picture or something.
[3341.40 → 3341.80] Yeah.
[3341.90 → 3342.52] It's very funny.
[3342.92 → 3343.10] Yes.
[3343.16 → 3343.42] Thank you.
[3343.42 → 3347.20] Getting you to sign it as a, as a signature of authenticity.
[3347.20 → 3348.04] Yeah.
[3348.68 → 3350.18] Hashtag lie in us.
[3350.70 → 3352.40] Uh, there's other good store news.
[3352.62 → 3357.12] Um, the, uh, stealth hoodies that we paid $12 shipped per, per unit.
[3357.30 → 3360.84] Uh, those are in stock now and we have not altered the pricing.
[3360.84 → 3363.04] So we're just absorbing that $12.
[3363.74 → 3365.20] Um, so guys get it.
[3365.30 → 3368.92] Stealth hoodie, the classic, uh, 59 99 USD.
[3369.18 → 3369.54] All right.
[3369.58 → 3371.06] That's, that's it for all that stuff.
[3371.58 → 3375.14] And, uh, actually, I don't know if I have anything.
[3375.14 → 3379.06] Uh, I don't know if I have anything else in here that's like worth talking about.
[3379.18 → 3382.06] YouTube is reportedly working on shorts to compete with TikTok.
[3382.12 → 3385.34] I mean, if it's anywhere near as bad as their stories feature, then I doubt it'll compete
[3385.34 → 3387.72] that much, but the stories get a lot of views.
[3387.78 → 3389.46] I can tell you a lot of people look at them.
[3390.18 → 3392.96] They just need to, they just need to improve the app a little bit.
[3392.96 → 3394.86] Because it's real, it's real clunky.
[3394.86 → 3396.86] Yeah.
[3397.98 → 3402.86] Um, I think one of YouTube's issues is going to be notifications and delivery, just like
[3402.86 → 3405.34] it is with stories to a certain degree.
[3405.94 → 3411.72] Um, with everything that they've tried to do other than just kind of like GOD, it feels,
[3411.90 → 3415.54] it, it has the like, this site wasn't made for this feel.
[3415.54 → 3418.96] Um, and like, where do you put it?
[3419.52 → 3420.64] I have no category.
[3420.64 → 3421.74] Does it even go under?
[3422.24 → 3426.86] Um, how do you make people care when someone shows up to the homepage?
[3427.34 → 3433.30] How do you decide like, Oh yeah, this person definitely wanted to see a, a short instead
[3433.30 → 3436.78] of a proper normal YouTube video.
[3436.78 → 3442.70] So they'd almost need like, like, I wonder if to a certain, at a certain point, if like
[3442.70 → 3445.78] a separate app would almost make more sense for these types of things.
[3445.88 → 3446.68] I don't think so.
[3446.76 → 3450.90] I think they have to find a way to bring it all under the YouTube umbrella for better
[3450.90 → 3452.50] or for worse, because here's the thing.
[3452.80 → 3454.26] Yeah, but they have YouTube music.
[3454.50 → 3457.30] They do, but that's not, that's just music.
[3457.30 → 3461.54] That's just them trying to like use the licensing for music that they already have for YouTube
[3461.54 → 3467.28] to make a, you know, have an easier approach to like music streaming.
[3467.46 → 3471.72] I think as far as I can tell, I don't know why Google play music is going away and YouTube
[3471.72 → 3474.52] music is replacing it because there's a branding thing.
[3474.58 → 3476.82] It may, it makes no sense to me whatsoever.
[3477.22 → 3480.96] Also Google play music is like nice and easy to use, and YouTube music is not.
[3481.48 → 3485.06] So yeah, there's that good old, good old Google, just doing Google things.
[3485.64 → 3491.26] Um, I mean, here's the thing too, is you and I might be looking at this TikTok clone
[3491.26 → 3495.56] or the store stories and not really able to understand it because we aren't the target
[3495.56 → 3502.40] audience, but I can tell you that when I'm on top of my YouTube stories, my subscription
[3502.40 → 3505.10] rate for the channel goes up.
[3505.54 → 3510.36] Stories are being fed to people who are otherwise not engaged with the content.
[3510.36 → 3515.10] It's a totally different audience member in a lot of cases, and they can be like a gateway
[3515.10 → 3519.40] drug to get people into the full-fledged techie content that we upload, like our longer form
[3519.40 → 3519.74] stuff.
[3519.74 → 3522.60] So there does appear to be a value to it.
[3522.66 → 3527.62] It's just something that I don't really understand that well because I'm not, uh, I'm not personally
[3527.62 → 3528.72] a member of that audience.
[3530.20 → 3530.60] Yeah.
[3530.88 → 3531.44] Makes sense.
[3533.42 → 3536.58] Um, I think that's pretty much it for the show this week.
[3536.58 → 3538.36] That's kind of a couple of super chats, maybe.
[3539.80 → 3541.10] Uh, okay.
[3541.20 → 3542.78] Logan game says, Hey, you.
[3543.82 → 3544.76] All righty then.
[3544.76 → 3550.62] Robert mail says, put this a $5 super chat a couple of minutes after we go live TGI Friday.
[3550.62 → 3552.74] Did you hear about zoom security being poor as all heck?
[3552.80 → 3553.34] Yeah, yeah, we did.
[3553.40 → 3557.50] That was, uh, that was one of our top stories in tech linked, uh, on Wednesday when I filmed
[3557.50 → 3564.24] it, shot that in my front yard because I have a new neighbour, um, who just like is always
[3564.24 → 3565.90] blasting music in their backyard.
[3565.90 → 3572.30] So my backyard just always has music coming over the fence, and it's like, it's not like
[3572.30 → 3576.30] classical music, you know, it's like annoying music.
[3576.30 → 3579.98] And sometimes the lyrics are explicit, and it's like, really?
[3580.06 → 3581.30] Oh, like get a clue.
[3581.62 → 3583.46] Like just, you're in a family neighbourhood.
[3583.58 → 3584.64] Maybe calm down a little bit.
[3584.78 → 3585.08] Yeah.
[3585.36 → 3586.76] Like just, just get a clue.
[3586.96 → 3588.28] It's just not necessary.
[3588.70 → 3592.78] And like, it's not, if they were just listening to it, like just loud enough for them to hear,
[3592.84 → 3593.52] that would be fine.
[3593.52 → 3596.52] But I'm not that close and it's loud.
[3596.64 → 3599.60] Like if I open my bedroom window, I can listen to their music.
[3599.60 → 3601.22] Like it's really annoying.
[3601.22 → 3603.46] Um, because I love Twitch chat.
[3603.56 → 3607.42] You're talking about this, like loud music, explicit lyrics and stuff.
[3607.46 → 3610.44] And somebody in chat, just in all caps, VENABLES?
[3610.70 → 3611.18] VENABLES.
[3611.20 → 3611.30] Yeah.
[3611.44 → 3613.38] No, I don't think so.
[3614.22 → 3616.52] Um, oh man.
[3616.58 → 3622.18] Twitch chat is just like, so, so brutal and like dumb sometimes.
[3623.38 → 3625.10] Ah, it's like this.
[3625.10 → 3627.30] I was trying to throw you a bone, but he's kind of right.
[3627.96 → 3629.42] I'm just like, there's, there's one person.
[3629.48 → 3630.28] I'm not even going to name them.
[3630.28 → 3632.96] They're like AKA black rap.
[3633.14 → 3634.44] That is nothing but vulgarity.
[3634.56 → 3639.12] Let me tell you, I've heard some white rap that is nothing but vulgarity.
[3639.12 → 3644.94] And I've, I've heard some, some other colours of rap that are pretty colourful too.
[3645.40 → 3646.94] I've also heard not rap.
[3647.08 → 3648.00] That's quite colourful.
[3648.10 → 3648.84] That's pretty vulgar.
[3649.12 → 3649.38] Yeah.
[3649.52 → 3652.60] Let's, let's not pretend that that's what this is about.
[3652.82 → 3657.98] There's plenty of rock music that like is directly about committing heinous crimes,
[3657.98 → 3660.18] but in an upbeat tone.
[3660.18 → 3661.28] So people don't realize.
[3661.54 → 3662.16] Oh yeah.
[3662.32 → 3666.54] Like the, oh man, there, there are, there's some music that I like listened to as a kid
[3666.54 → 3669.56] and I'm like, yeah, no wonder my parents didn't want me to listen to this.
[3669.62 → 3670.62] I didn't understand what it was about.
[3670.62 → 3671.56] Oh yeah.
[3671.96 → 3672.36] Um, yeah.
[3672.54 → 3675.32] Metal Gappy says, Hey, how are you enjoying the DJI FPV stuff?
[3675.36 → 3676.96] Actually, Colin's been playing around with it.
[3677.02 → 3677.70] Hit him up on Twitter.
[3677.80 → 3682.70] I think you can find his Twitter handle in the credits of any video that he helped do.
[3682.82 → 3684.82] So like, uh, we've got one coming up.
[3684.82 → 3690.06] Um, the, the, the sub $100 3d printer, uh, his Twitter should be in there.
[3691.78 → 3696.36] Uh, Dragon Boy Studio says my first WAN show requires that I donate or my first live WAN
[3696.36 → 3696.56] show.
[3696.62 → 3696.84] All right.
[3696.88 → 3697.22] Thank you.
[3697.30 → 3697.94] Thank you very much.
[3697.98 → 3698.62] Thanks, Taken.
[3699.54 → 3702.80] That is the, uh, that is the standard way of things.
[3703.68 → 3704.66] This is the way.
[3705.10 → 3706.28] First WAN show donate.
[3706.52 → 3709.38] Sherwin says, what the hell is on your chin?
[3711.12 → 3711.50] What?
[3711.50 → 3713.80] It's a, oh, it's a pop filter.
[3714.12 → 3715.10] I think he means it though.
[3715.32 → 3715.84] I think he means it.
[3717.00 → 3717.82] Oh, pretty sure.
[3717.82 → 3720.98] That's not just his chin by the way, but you know.
[3721.42 → 3722.04] All right.
[3722.28 → 3724.36] Um, thanks Brendan.
[3724.72 → 3727.30] Thanks Arthur Cubs.
[3729.14 → 3730.66] Uh, what else we got here?
[3730.82 → 3731.32] All right.
[3731.40 → 3735.38] Uh, Justin says, are you guys going to send Luke a decent camera and Mike for future WAN shows?
[3735.60 → 3736.82] No, he has a camera.
[3736.90 → 3738.44] He just needs to find the cable for it.
[3739.10 → 3740.70] You've lost a lot of cables lately.
[3740.70 → 3742.76] You lost all your display port cables.
[3742.86 → 3743.60] Did you find those?
[3744.42 → 3744.80] All my what?
[3744.86 → 3744.98] Sorry.
[3745.08 → 3747.04] Your display port cables that you ordered to the office.
[3747.80 → 3748.16] No.
[3748.88 → 3749.78] They're just gone.
[3750.30 → 3751.96] I've looked a number of times.
[3752.28 → 3754.72] Um, but yeah, I can't find them.
[3754.86 → 3757.80] Last I heard, I think weren't cables.
[3758.00 → 3758.34] No.
[3759.30 → 3759.52] Yeah.
[3759.54 → 3763.40] I couldn't really find the cable bins last time I was in there and all the inventory guys were gone.
[3763.54 → 3764.46] So I just left.
[3764.60 → 3764.92] Okay.
[3765.02 → 3765.50] Maybe they can.
[3765.50 → 3766.64] I haven't been in there for a while.
[3767.10 → 3767.50] Okay.
[3767.50 → 3769.78] Um, here T asks a good question.
[3770.26 → 3771.00] This is a good question.
[3771.34 → 3774.50] Is it worth getting a valve index as a monitor replacement?
[3774.76 → 3776.14] I've been wanting to do this for ages.
[3776.78 → 3777.76] That's a good answer.
[3778.28 → 3779.96] It's a good answer to a good question.
[3780.04 → 3783.76] We are still a couple of resolution bumps away from that.
[3783.76 → 3788.06] And then a couple of comfort, uh, breakthroughs away from that.
[3789.14 → 3789.36] Yeah.
[3789.52 → 3807.14] It's, it's like the, the, the, the dream, the pipe dream at the time and dream now that that is, uh, when, when you were looking at like DK one, uh, we're insanely closer to it now than we were.
[3807.14 → 3807.50] Yeah.
[3807.50 → 3811.16] But we're still probably almost just as far away.
[3811.36 → 3813.16] We're still a long way away.
[3813.62 → 3813.98] Yeah.
[3814.34 → 3820.52] Um, Jeff Jones says, I know you touched on it last week, but is it wrong for YouTube premium members to fast-forward through your sponsor spots?
[3820.52 → 3821.10] I mean, nothing.
[3821.22 → 3821.70] I don't know.
[3821.78 → 3822.62] It's all up to you.
[3822.66 → 3823.48] What's wrong or right.
[3823.62 → 3830.52] I can tell you that we make more on you being a YouTube premium member than pretty much any other way that you can contribute other than, uh, subscribing to flow plane.
[3830.88 → 3831.72] LTTstore.com.
[3832.20 → 3832.40] Yeah.
[3832.46 → 3833.36] And LTTstore.com.
[3833.36 → 3838.92] If you buy a shirt every month, that would be more than if you're a YouTube premium member, but YouTube premium is definitely better than ad.
[3839.14 → 3840.58] Maximum flow plane subscription.
[3840.86 → 3841.06] Yeah.
[3841.06 → 3842.10] Shirt every month.
[3842.18 → 3842.40] Yeah.
[3842.54 → 3844.92] Twitch subscriber forum contributor.
[3845.58 → 3846.34] What a shill.
[3847.50 → 3848.38] We're getting up there.
[3848.44 → 3849.38] I'm not going to correct you though.
[3849.40 → 3849.92] It's not wrong.
[3850.16 → 3850.64] You're not wrong.
[3850.78 → 3851.46] That'd be great.
[3852.42 → 3854.30] We can't really ask that of you guys though.
[3854.60 → 3854.94] No.
[3856.56 → 3857.50] That's a lot of shirts.
[3858.50 → 3859.26] All right.
[3859.32 → 3861.28] Chris says, uh, have a good weekend boys.
[3861.34 → 3862.36] I'm going out for a rip.
[3862.36 → 3863.26] All right.
[3863.26 → 3863.68] Sounds good.
[3863.72 → 3865.04] Just maintain your social distancing.
[3865.18 → 3865.50] All right.
[3865.98 → 3866.30] Yeah.
[3866.30 → 3866.74] All right.
[3867.14 → 3869.40] You're the only one allowed in the, in the, in the ripping device.
[3869.50 → 3870.22] Yeah, that's right.
[3870.44 → 3871.58] You've got to be six feet apart.
[3873.02 → 3874.34] Well, that's it for me.
[3874.62 → 3875.48] What's, what's new with you?
[3875.52 → 3880.30] Hey, you wanted to talk about your, um, your, your streaming setup for the professors last week.
[3880.30 → 3882.80] And people informed me that I was very rude and cut you off.
[3882.84 → 3883.88] I actually didn't mean to.
[3884.00 → 3888.68] I was just, I was kind of tuned out because I was trying to fix something to do with the stream.
[3888.68 → 3894.34] So I wasn't really listening, and it seemed like you were like starting, apparently it seemed like you were trying to start a conversation about it.
[3894.36 → 3895.60] And I just like moved on.
[3895.92 → 3897.96] So why don't you tell me about what you were doing?
[3898.20 → 3898.78] I did.
[3898.78 → 3901.82] Oh, so were you just done?
[3902.08 → 3902.74] Like, was that it?
[3903.74 → 3916.00] I was not done, but someone from the IT team of that school showed up in the Twitch chat and probably sent roughly, I'm just going to throw a guess at like a hundred messages.
[3916.00 → 3921.68] Uh, that very much felt like a SWAT team trying to knock on my door, trying to get attention.
[3922.02 → 3924.84] This is, this is so-and-so from, from this thing.
[3924.92 → 3925.84] I work in this department.
[3926.00 → 3926.92] You need to talk to me.
[3927.00 → 3928.16] I need to communicate with you now.
[3928.28 → 3929.22] I can prove identity.
[3929.38 → 3930.24] We need to solve this.
[3930.46 → 3934.76] And that was like constantly being posted in the Twitch chat.
[3934.76 → 3940.92] And then when you rated my girlfriend's stream afterwards, he went there and kept posting it.
[3941.48 → 3952.18] So I eventually had to be like, Hey man, you should probably deal with this internally and not through Twitch chat and not talk to me because I'm just trying to help them.
[3952.48 → 3957.26] Uh, so yeah, there's been some, some developments there.
[3957.36 → 3964.74] It, I, I'm not going to go way too far into it because I probably shouldn't, but it blows.
[3964.76 → 3965.94] It blows my mind.
[3966.78 → 3978.84] The lack of rising to the occasion that has happened from certain, uh, departments at certain companies or organizations at this time.
[3979.52 → 3979.96] Okay.
[3980.14 → 3982.16] That got real awkward, real fast.
[3982.74 → 3983.10] All right.
[3983.92 → 3989.58] Speaking of awkward, I have a poll for our viewers, uh, that I will be posting.
[3989.58 → 3991.24] I'm going to hit float plane first.
[3991.98 → 3993.92] So we'll get their results first guys.
[3993.92 → 3999.02] Go ahead and, uh, submit your, submit your votes, submit your votes in the poll.
[3999.18 → 3999.50] Okay.
[4000.20 → 4002.54] I'm going to get these, these polls in there.
[4003.24 → 4005.06] They're like, this poll is going to be fire.
[4005.16 → 4007.06] If you know what I'm saying, you know, know what I'm saying?
[4007.72 → 4008.34] Fire poll.
[4009.44 → 4009.84] Okay.
[4009.98 → 4010.80] I got to know.
[4010.88 → 4011.76] I just got to know.
[4014.42 → 4014.78] Okay.
[4014.98 → 4016.08] I'm going to vote for you.
[4016.18 → 4016.62] Here we go.
[4016.70 → 4017.02] Here we go.
[4017.02 → 4017.76] I'm voting for you.
[4017.82 → 4018.62] I'm voting for you.
[4018.84 → 4019.18] Okay.
[4019.18 → 4020.28] All right.
[4020.76 → 4023.56] Let's have, let's have a look at, let's have a look at the results here.
[4023.70 → 4025.70] Actually, do you want to pull up the do you want to pull up the results?
[4026.20 → 4026.50] Sure.
[4026.60 → 4028.14] We'll screen share, screen share your side.
[4028.20 → 4029.76] I don't have screen share setup.
[4030.42 → 4031.46] Oh my goodness.
[4031.46 → 4033.46] People are very passionate about this.
[4033.54 → 4035.02] The votes are pouring in.
[4035.70 → 4037.48] They're pouring in my friends.
[4037.48 → 4039.48] We've only got like 10,000 people watching.
[4039.58 → 4042.20] I don't think I've ever seen this high engagement with a poll.
[4042.92 → 4043.42] All right.
[4043.48 → 4049.76] Luke's up at 39% with, I hate it when mommy and daddy make me choose at 31% followed by
[4049.76 → 4050.34] Linus.
[4051.74 → 4055.44] Oh, I, I said I was going to vote for you and I did.
[4055.52 → 4059.68] But then after I said that I read the I hate it when mommy and daddy make me choose.
[4059.68 → 4061.26] And that's what I would have voted for.
[4061.82 → 4064.50] If I read that before I said I was going to vote for you.
[4064.66 → 4064.98] Wow.
[4065.02 → 4066.96] We've got over 2000 votes.
[4067.00 → 4067.30] Okay.
[4067.48 → 4068.28] So it's official.
[4068.48 → 4071.86] I got to get rid of this thing because you rock it.
[4071.92 → 4072.74] You rock it better.
[4072.98 → 4073.68] You rock it better.
[4073.78 → 4076.12] It's maybe development is not done yet.
[4076.22 → 4077.32] Maybe you need to keep working.
[4077.76 → 4079.28] You have the time now.
[4079.78 → 4080.58] Oh man.
[4081.08 → 4081.34] Yeah.
[4081.38 → 4082.10] I suppose.
[4082.24 → 4085.54] Although I have been appearing on camera throughout the whole thing.
[4085.54 → 4089.44] So it's not like I just get to transform from like scrub tactic to having one.
[4089.76 → 4091.12] I was going to leave that part.
[4091.18 → 4094.46] And the best part is that the videos are going up completely out of order.
[4094.46 → 4098.58] So it's just going to make no sense for like weeks.
[4100.26 → 4106.16] How has production been through this whole thing?
[4106.38 → 4109.78] Oh, it's been frustrating and tiring.
[4109.78 → 4112.36] Like I have to do most of my own setup.
[4112.50 → 4113.76] Yvonne's had to like film with me.
[4113.76 → 4118.38] She did a shockingly good job of the vlog where we set up 100 Bluetooth speakers in our house though.
[4118.68 → 4119.70] Like I was watching it back.
[4119.78 → 4120.80] I was like, yeah, sure.
[4120.86 → 4121.44] I'd hire her.
[4121.78 → 4122.18] It's all right.
[4122.38 → 4122.58] Yeah.
[4122.58 → 4123.06] Yeah.
[4123.06 → 4123.22] Yeah.
[4124.02 → 4125.24] I'd hang around with that chick.
[4125.36 → 4125.80] You know what I mean?
[4126.76 → 4126.94] No.
[4129.46 → 4129.86] Anyway.
[4131.70 → 4132.14] Yeah.
[4132.24 → 4138.42] No, it's been, we only got five done this week when we were definitely aiming for, you
[4138.42 → 4139.86] know, one per release day.
[4140.06 → 4140.48] So six.
[4141.22 → 4145.04] I do have something that I like could film tonight or on the weekend, but I'm like, I'm
[4145.04 → 4149.34] tired because it's just, it's taking a toll on me doing all the setup, all the tear
[4149.34 → 4154.86] down, all the hosting, like the team is doing their best.
[4154.98 → 4158.66] They're, they're supporting me as best they can remotely, but it's tough.
[4158.68 → 4158.92] Right.
[4159.66 → 4160.62] I just don't.
[4160.72 → 4162.48] And sometimes I just don't have all the materials I need.
[4162.48 → 4165.50] Like I, I needed a secondary camera for the stream earlier today.
[4165.50 → 4170.46] And I realized that the black magic cinema camera that I have is SDI only, and I don't
[4170.46 → 4171.96] have an SDI capture card.
[4171.96 → 4173.68] And then I needed a longer HDMI cable.
[4173.68 → 4178.84] I had to go tear that out of literally embedded in one of my walls in order to get the camera
[4178.84 → 4179.42] where I needed it.
[4179.42 → 4184.78] Just like one thing after another compared to the studio, which just has everything there,
[4184.78 → 4187.30] like within reach, you know?
[4187.84 → 4188.04] Yeah.
[4188.20 → 4189.20] So that's been frustrating.
[4189.20 → 4192.90] But I also think that it's the most fun I've had in a long time.
[4194.82 → 4197.04] Because it's kind of like, it's kind of raw.
[4197.30 → 4197.66] Yeah.
[4198.14 → 4198.44] Yeah.
[4198.72 → 4198.98] Yeah.
[4198.98 → 4199.20] Yeah.
[4199.60 → 4200.78] I can totally see that.
[4200.78 → 4201.92] Out of necessity.
[4201.92 → 4210.24] Like every video that I work on has to be like, just kind of doing something crazy at
[4210.24 → 4210.50] home.
[4211.34 → 4213.94] So it's been really enjoyable that way, if nothing else.
[4214.88 → 4215.04] Yeah.
[4215.50 → 4215.94] Yeah.
[4215.94 → 4223.76] I think, um, as horrible as all this stuff is, and it is horrible, the, the opportunities
[4223.76 → 4227.50] to rise to occasions are very fulfilling when you can do them.
[4228.12 → 4234.26] Um, and there's, so there, if you're in a position where that's a possibility, it's kind
[4234.26 → 4235.64] of, it's nice.
[4235.74 → 4236.44] I like the challenge.
[4236.44 → 4237.50] I'm enjoying the challenge.
[4237.96 → 4239.00] Yeah, exactly.
[4239.00 → 4241.90] And, and the audience is going to understand recording this.
[4241.96 → 4245.40] Like it's, it's pretty obvious why what's happening is happening.
[4245.40 → 4248.86] So you don't get the like what the heck reaction from the audience.
[4248.86 → 4252.58] You're probably getting more of an appreciation reaction from the audience.
[4252.68 → 4257.02] People are pretty forgiving of the, the lapses in quality so far.
[4257.02 → 4257.44] Yeah.
[4257.78 → 4257.96] Yeah.
[4258.44 → 4262.66] So like it, it, it's kind of, it's, uh, it's not that bad.
[4263.34 → 4264.74] Um, Hey, you know what?
[4264.78 → 4268.38] I think we talked about this on a previous stream, but I don't think we ever actually
[4268.38 → 4269.32] showed it.
[4269.94 → 4275.44] Um, so the, the Halo remastered, whatever thing, Master Chief Collection.
[4277.42 → 4279.10] I have that file here.
[4279.24 → 4280.00] I have that file.
[4281.34 → 4283.50] Okay, guys, check, check this out.
[4283.56 → 4283.82] Okay.
[4283.90 → 4285.48] So you're going to, you're going to see it on the stream.
[4285.56 → 4286.68] So it's going to be a little bit delayed.
[4286.68 → 4286.80] Yeah.
[4286.80 → 4290.94] I can't believe I haven't been recording this because this was the most fun that I had
[4290.94 → 4294.96] playing a video game in probably years.
[4294.96 → 4295.98] Grenade, grenade for sure.
[4295.98 → 4296.30] Me too.
[4296.36 → 4297.16] Rockets can be too much.
[4297.16 → 4301.40] Luke and I decided to, uh, to just kind of bro out one evening.
[4301.76 → 4307.76] I have no idea how to, uh, how to control this media.
[4308.30 → 4309.10] Uh, okay.
[4309.10 → 4313.42] Once it's in OBS, I guess I might just have to grab a screen region.
[4313.80 → 4313.82] Yeah.
[4313.82 → 4314.64] I think it just sort of plays.
[4314.86 → 4318.60] You could play it in a, in a media player and just capture that.
[4318.62 → 4319.44] I'm going to do that.
[4319.50 → 4319.72] Okay.
[4319.74 → 4320.32] Let's do that.
[4320.32 → 4323.26] So we decided to tackle the silent.
[4323.26 → 4326.36] I can't believe I have this, the, the level where you storm the beach.
[4326.36 → 4327.12] Silent cartographer.
[4327.12 → 4330.64] You have to get down to the silent cartographer in halo one.
[4331.18 → 4332.58] Uh, we weren't streaming or anything.
[4332.58 → 4333.74] I wish we were streaming.
[4333.74 → 4336.38] Cause that was high hilarious.
[4336.74 → 4337.96] It was actually amazing.
[4338.04 → 4339.02] Splay capture.
[4339.38 → 4342.86] That would have been the best stream I've had in, in years, if not ever.
[4342.86 → 4344.60] And I didn't stream it.
[4346.52 → 4348.40] It would have been my best stream ever for sure.
[4348.52 → 4348.80] All right.
[4348.82 → 4349.34] So here we go.
[4349.38 → 4349.82] Here we go.
[4351.06 → 4354.72] Let's see if I can find a couple, a couple, a couple of these classic moments.
[4355.18 → 4357.66] Uh, so you can't, you can't see this very easily.
[4357.66 → 4357.90] Eh?
[4359.30 → 4359.66] Okay.
[4359.70 → 4360.38] So hold on a second.
[4360.38 → 4363.06] So here's where we're trying to get through this door.
[4365.06 → 4365.62] Oh man.
[4365.70 → 4367.30] I have to, I have to mute that.
[4367.40 → 4368.10] I have to mute that.
[4368.24 → 4371.98] So basically what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the warthog all the way down
[4371.98 → 4373.52] to the map room.
[4373.78 → 4379.26] So you can see, we actually, I think this one, we blasted across the chasm with a grenade.
[4380.28 → 4382.90] Um, Luke, are you looking at this one yet?
[4382.98 → 4385.16] Is this the one that we hit with the rocket launcher or with the grenade?
[4385.24 → 4385.48] Oh yeah.
[4385.52 → 4389.82] So we've got two warthogs here now because our brilliant idea for how to get the first
[4389.82 → 4391.74] one through was to ram it from behind.
[4393.10 → 4398.66] So what we're trying to do right now is written this one without knocking it down into the chasm
[4398.66 → 4400.70] here, because if we do, it dies.
[4400.70 → 4403.72] Meanwhile, that one at the front is kind of glitched in the door.
[4408.06 → 4414.88] We like for context, I just kind of started doing this pretty early on, and we kept on
[4414.88 → 4417.36] saying like, like, it's not going to work.
[4417.48 → 4419.60] We're not going to be able to get it past this next point.
[4419.60 → 4424.52] And then we just kept being able to do it, and we ended up accomplishing the whole freaking
[4424.52 → 4427.76] level and then back out again, which was kind of epic.
[4428.24 → 4428.72] Hold on.
[4428.76 → 4431.88] Where's the part where it did we, where's the part where we managed to get that one through
[4431.88 → 4432.38] the door?
[4432.80 → 4433.94] This took forever.
[4433.94 → 4435.92] Like it took forever to get through this door.
[4437.44 → 4440.24] That section in particular took an extremely long time.
[4440.24 → 4442.18] I don't even remember how it went through.
[4442.34 → 4442.74] Ultimately.
[4443.26 → 4445.62] I think I got on the other side.
[4446.52 → 4450.22] We, we, we killed the covenant on the other side and I got on the other side and I think
[4450.22 → 4454.54] we just shot under it with a rocket, and it popped the front end up enough that it was
[4454.54 → 4455.46] able to get through the door.
[4455.58 → 4456.48] I think that's what happened.
[4456.54 → 4458.28] Was that while I was driving it?
[4459.34 → 4460.24] I think so.
[4460.38 → 4462.32] I think this might be, this might be the moment.
[4462.40 → 4463.20] Are you sure it was a rocket?
[4463.46 → 4464.26] You can see my marker.
[4464.70 → 4466.00] I'm not sure if it was a rocket.
[4466.38 → 4467.80] Might've been a grenade as well.
[4468.14 → 4474.58] So it was a combination of ramming them through using grenades and using the rocket launcher.
[4475.08 → 4476.74] I think you're holding a rocket launcher here.
[4476.78 → 4477.62] I think this might be it.
[4479.92 → 4480.50] Let's see.
[4480.92 → 4481.40] Oh man.
[4481.44 → 4483.40] It's like completely glitched out.
[4483.86 → 4487.28] This is like the dumbest segment of WAN show I think we've ever done.
[4487.68 → 4488.36] There it is.
[4488.46 → 4489.06] There it is.
[4489.18 → 4489.72] Look at this.
[4490.44 → 4491.56] What even is that?
[4492.18 → 4492.94] What even is that?
[4492.94 → 4492.98] Yeah.
[4492.98 → 4493.34] Yeah.
[4497.18 → 4498.32] So ridiculous.
[4498.42 → 4499.12] So cool.
[4499.94 → 4501.04] So ridiculous.
[4503.66 → 4505.62] Anyway, the best moment.
[4505.72 → 4511.98] The best moment is definitely the drive-through order of silent cartographer.
[4512.18 → 4514.14] Did we really drive it all the way out?
[4515.32 → 4515.64] Yes.
[4515.80 → 4516.62] I don't know if we did.
[4516.72 → 4517.14] Did we really?
[4517.14 → 4517.46] We did.
[4517.68 → 4518.46] We drove it out.
[4519.36 → 4520.96] Or we drove a different one out.
[4521.08 → 4521.68] I don't remember.
[4521.68 → 4522.64] Because we have three.
[4522.98 → 4523.18] Yeah.
[4523.20 → 4524.22] We had three in there.
[4524.30 → 4527.06] That was why we were up exploring on the surface at some point.
[4527.64 → 4527.78] Okay.
[4527.84 → 4530.88] Is this where we're fighting our way out?
[4532.44 → 4532.72] Yeah.
[4533.04 → 4533.28] Yeah.
[4533.28 → 4533.74] Here it is.
[4533.78 → 4534.22] Here it is.
[4535.52 → 4535.88] All right.
[4535.92 → 4536.58] So there we are.
[4536.74 → 4537.24] Map room.
[4537.24 → 4552.48] Give it a try, guys.
[4552.48 → 4554.36] I don't know how we got it through this one.
[4554.36 → 4556.86] Like, that is very clearly too small.
[4558.86 → 4560.46] It's trying so hard.
[4563.74 → 4564.88] It's so dumb.
[4565.72 → 4566.10] Didn't it?
[4567.00 → 4567.82] Yeah, there you go.
[4567.92 → 4568.58] There it is.
[4568.58 → 4573.56] So we've got the warthog in the cut scene.
[4573.64 → 4578.26] Because I think I spend the next little bit trying to pull up to it like the drive-through.
[4578.40 → 4578.52] Yeah.
[4578.74 → 4582.20] And then Luke gets in the hog, I think.
[4582.30 → 4585.46] And then I try to activate it and then jump into it at the same time.
[4586.00 → 4586.28] Because I...
[4586.28 → 4587.90] You end up like partially in it.
[4588.04 → 4588.26] Yeah.
[4588.28 → 4588.94] Something like that.
[4589.00 → 4589.16] Here.
[4589.30 → 4590.58] The cut scene is about to go.
[4590.58 → 4591.18] So we're going to go to the end.
[4591.18 → 4593.40] Our goal was to have a warthog in every cut scene.
[4593.80 → 4595.82] And we sort of did it.
[4595.84 → 4596.08] Yeah.
[4596.34 → 4596.70] Cool.
[4598.86 → 4600.90] One of them, we triggered the cut scene a little bit too early.
[4600.98 → 4602.02] The warthog was still there.
[4602.18 → 4603.90] It just wasn't exactly where we wanted it to be.
[4604.32 → 4604.88] We were...
[4604.88 → 4608.60] At the end, we were trying to get the warthog into the pelican.
[4609.20 → 4609.60] Yeah.
[4609.70 → 4611.56] That was too hard.
[4611.64 → 4612.86] We couldn't get the timing right.
[4612.96 → 4618.84] We were trying to drive it towards it and then time it so that a grenade would go off,
[4618.84 → 4621.40] lifting the front end enough to drive it in.
[4622.30 → 4626.14] We also tried just like shooting it with a rocket launcher just to kind of blast it in there.
[4626.20 → 4626.68] And we just...
[4626.68 → 4628.20] We couldn't get it to go.
[4628.20 → 4630.44] If we had more supplies, it might have been easier.
[4630.54 → 4631.20] But we had like...
[4631.20 → 4635.60] I think it was one rocket and like two or three grenades, maybe.
[4635.94 → 4636.10] Yeah.
[4636.20 → 4638.72] At one point in time, I think we only had one grenade.
[4638.90 → 4641.94] Because it kept auto-saving as we were using more and more consumables.
[4642.08 → 4642.26] Yeah.
[4642.84 → 4645.44] And it just got extremely tedious.
[4647.00 → 4647.64] So...
[4647.64 → 4651.24] So we stopped having fun, which is basically, you know, the point where...
[4651.24 → 4652.04] It's kind of the point.
[4652.38 → 4654.10] Any game, you kind of stop playing it.
[4654.66 → 4654.92] Yeah.
[4655.70 → 4658.14] So I think you do the cinematic pretty soon here.
[4658.70 → 4658.92] Yeah.
[4658.98 → 4662.04] I think we were discussing like how we wanted to do it for a while.
[4662.22 → 4662.46] Yeah.
[4663.72 → 4664.30] Oh, hold on.
[4664.36 → 4664.82] There it is.
[4665.12 → 4665.38] Okay.
[4665.58 → 4667.42] Press E to activate the silent cartographer.
[4667.56 → 4667.92] Here we go.
[4667.96 → 4668.32] Here we go.
[4668.80 → 4669.86] So yeah, I think...
[4669.86 → 4671.46] Do I tell you to get out and get in the gun?
[4671.52 → 4672.12] Oh yeah, there we go.
[4672.16 → 4672.52] There we go.
[4672.52 → 4674.04] So I activated it and then got in.
[4674.04 → 4679.16] So you're like stuck in the water and clipped in it.
[4681.56 → 4681.92] Okay.
[4681.98 → 4682.22] Hello.
[4682.30 → 4682.46] Yes.
[4682.50 → 4684.58] I'll have a Big Mac and fries, please.
[4684.70 → 4686.42] The camera's just like in the car.
[4686.52 → 4686.74] Yeah.
[4689.56 → 4690.14] So dumb.
[4690.14 → 4691.26] I love stuff like that.
[4691.36 → 4691.98] So dumb.
[4692.22 → 4692.64] All right.
[4693.80 → 4694.18] Great.
[4694.26 → 4694.90] Great show today.
[4695.02 → 4695.82] Thank you very much.
[4695.98 → 4697.04] Thanks guys for tuning in.
[4697.08 → 4697.92] We'll see you again next week.
[4698.16 → 4698.74] Same bat time.
[4698.84 → 4699.46] Same bat channel.
[4700.16 → 4701.08] Bye.
[4702.68 → 4703.88] Now for the next one, right?
[4703.98 → 4704.10] Yeah.
[4704.20 → 4704.32] Yeah.
[4704.38 → 4704.52] Yeah.
[4704.52 → 4704.86] One more.
[4704.94 → 4705.22] One more.
[4705.30 → 4705.44] All right.
[4705.48 → 4707.06] We really have to do another one.
[4707.34 → 4707.68] All right.
[4707.72 → 4707.84] Okay.
[4707.84 → 4707.98] Bye.
[4708.76 → 4709.04] Bye.
[4709.04 → 4709.12] Bye.
[4710.58 → 4710.64] Bye.
