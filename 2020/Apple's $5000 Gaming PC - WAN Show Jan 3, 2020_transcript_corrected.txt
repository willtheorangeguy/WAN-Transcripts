[0.00 → 2.00] There we go, okay.
[2.00 → 6.00] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the WAN Show!
[6.00 → 10.00] I was late because I was gaming in VR.
[10.00 → 13.00] That's it. That's it. That's the only excuse I have.
[13.00 → 14.00] That's it? That's all?
[14.00 → 20.00] But I was actually making a video about gaming in VR, and it's really cool.
[20.00 → 22.00] So do you know about the latest updates to the Oculus?
[22.00 → 24.00] Okay, you know what? We'll talk about it later.
[24.00 → 25.00] Yeah.
[25.00 → 27.00] The Oculus Quest is even cooler now.
[27.00 → 28.00] We got subjects.
[28.00 → 31.00] Yeah, we got them topics.
[31.00 → 32.00] Those titles.
[32.00 → 38.00] Apple, rumoured to be working on a $5,000 gaming machine.
[38.00 → 39.00] Necessary.
[39.00 → 43.00] California's new data and privacy rights go into effect.
[43.00 → 50.00] And just... there's a Segway wheelchair thing.
[50.00 → 52.00] But it's not a wheelchair.
[52.00 → 53.00] No.
[53.00 → 54.00] It's more of a chair on wheels.
[54.00 → 55.00] Yeah.
[55.00 → 56.00] If that makes sense.
[56.00 → 58.00] We got like a throne on wheels.
[58.00 → 59.00] What else we got?
[59.00 → 63.00] Also, airdrop for Android, but only for some Chinese brands.
[63.00 → 64.00] And that's about it.
[64.00 → 65.00] Okay.
[65.00 → 72.00] Yeah, we're definitely going to want to chat about the cool stuff like the Oculus Quest updates and stuff.
[72.00 → 73.00] Yeah.
[73.00 → 74.00] Yeah.
[74.00 → 75.00] So, that intro.
[75.00 → 76.00] And my keyboard.
[76.00 → 78.00] What about your keyboard?
[78.00 → 79.00] It's dead.
[79.00 → 80.00] No.
[80.00 → 84.00] The Team Liquid signed one?
[84.00 → 85.00] Wow!
[85.00 → 89.74] The cheapest man alive might have to actually replace a piece of hardware.
[89.90 → 90.88] I'm going to try to fix it.
[91.02 → 92.06] Of course you are.
[92.58 → 94.06] And the intro time.
[115.00 → 118.98] Brought to you by Squarespace, Display, and View Sonic.
[119.86 → 120.30] Okay.
[120.88 → 124.00] First, guys, I got to address this comment I just saw in the chat.
[124.08 → 126.96] Wow, Linus is really warming up to VR since last year.
[128.48 → 130.10] I always liked VR.
[130.48 → 133.24] It was never a matter of me not liking VR.
[133.64 → 137.16] The issue was that VR had inaccessibility problems.
[137.16 → 143.78] And I said, I said in my Oculus Quest review that I never saw that coming.
[143.78 → 146.20] Like that degree of optimization.
[146.50 → 150.78] The amount of inside, the accuracy of their inside out tracking.
[150.94 → 151.72] I didn't see it coming.
[151.82 → 156.52] And I had seen things already that led me to believe that it wasn't going to be possible.
[156.78 → 159.24] By the way, the WAN show today is shot on red.
[160.16 → 161.26] I didn't even notice.
[161.56 → 161.84] What?
[163.68 → 167.72] All of our C200s are heading down to CES.
[167.86 → 168.68] So they're all packed up.
[168.82 → 169.42] It looks great.
[169.42 → 169.78] Yeah.
[170.18 → 170.86] So what?
[171.14 → 172.76] Usually we shoot it on a C200.
[172.76 → 177.50] But, you know, if you notice the WAN show was looking real sharp today.
[177.72 → 179.72] We're live-streaming on YouTube.
[180.56 → 181.56] How much is that?
[181.64 → 182.98] And Flow plane and Twitch.
[183.40 → 185.40] We paid 30 grand for that camera.
[185.62 → 187.46] Hey, Brandon, what's that lens worth?
[188.64 → 190.78] It's a $3,000 lens.
[191.18 → 191.50] Okay.
[191.98 → 198.34] You got like, you know, $200 cable to attach the monitor for the camera over somewhere else.
[198.34 → 198.84] Doesn't matter.
[198.94 → 203.98] The point is, let's talk about Apple's rumoured $5,000 gaming machine.
[204.30 → 207.48] So this was posted on the forum by William CLL.
[207.60 → 208.84] And I'll give you guys the breakdown.
[209.00 → 211.86] Then I'm sure we're going to have a fair bit of discussion about this one.
[211.92 → 215.86] According to market rumours, Apple plans to launch an esports PC.
[215.86 → 219.78] Next year, with a unit price of up to $5,000.
[220.28 → 225.30] According to supply chain sources, it may be a large screen all-in-one or a large screen gaming laptop.
[225.60 → 228.64] It's expected to be announced at WWDC next June.
[229.12 → 231.24] Now, there are some reasons to be suspicious.
[231.72 → 237.72] There are some games, like Rocket League, Fortnite, and World of Warcraft, that do work on Mac.
[237.72 → 243.50] But you can't get consumer GPUs from NVIDIA in Apple products.
[244.40 → 247.38] And that doesn't look like it's going to be clearing up anytime soon.
[247.48 → 251.12] NVIDIA just formally dropped CUBA support on macOS recently.
[251.30 → 252.58] I don't think that's a huge deal.
[252.96 → 257.12] Because it's probably not going to be a user-replaceable GPU anyway.
[258.34 → 258.78] Yeah.
[259.00 → 259.36] Okay.
[259.48 → 260.46] That's true.
[261.18 → 262.62] But, okay.
[262.68 → 263.08] You know what?
[263.24 → 263.60] Forget it.
[263.64 → 265.50] That's all the information that we really have.
[265.52 → 266.28] We don't know much.
[266.46 → 266.58] Yeah.
[266.62 → 267.12] We don't really know.
[267.12 → 267.30] Okay.
[267.30 → 268.30] Maybe that is a big deal.
[268.38 → 270.80] We know that there are compatibility issues.
[270.92 → 271.20] Yes.
[271.48 → 277.50] But we also know that with Apple's push with the arcade, trying to get better games on the App Store,
[278.12 → 280.86] with Apple's recent push is...
[280.86 → 282.00] They seem to care more suddenly.
[282.00 → 287.72] They seem to care an awful lot about gaming, even if they aren't or haven't up until this point
[287.72 → 295.02] been willing to engage with gaming the way that gamers want to do it or the way that the rest of the industry does it.
[295.02 → 303.80] They might develop a gaming launcher that has containers set up to run games in it that aren't natively supported by Apple.
[305.42 → 306.34] They could do that.
[306.82 → 308.26] People do that on Linux all the time.
[308.26 → 308.88] I wonder...
[308.88 → 309.18] I wonder...
[309.18 → 309.48] Yeah.
[309.48 → 309.82] Sup, sake?
[309.98 → 310.18] Yeah.
[310.52 → 311.96] Proton, like, wine.
[312.06 → 312.42] Wine.
[312.68 → 312.82] Yeah.
[312.92 → 314.30] But the problem with that...
[314.30 → 322.18] I've got a friend who I think it's his hobby to see, like, what he can force to work in Linux in terms of gaming.
[322.18 → 322.58] Okay.
[322.74 → 323.78] Hold on a second, though.
[323.90 → 327.60] But would that necessarily even be feasible for Apple?
[327.68 → 333.06] Like, I know Steam is a big name that has worked on a compatibility layer.
[333.24 → 333.44] Yeah.
[334.54 → 337.18] But I don't think...
[338.00 → 338.40] Okay.
[339.50 → 340.12] What are...
[340.12 → 341.06] Okay, maybe you can...
[341.06 → 342.46] I don't think they do it for everything.
[342.46 → 346.40] What are the legal ramifications of emulating someone else?
[346.40 → 353.40] Like, if it's a DirectX-only title, are you allowed to just, like...
[355.02 → 355.98] I don't...
[355.98 → 357.14] Yeah, I don't think that's a problem.
[357.38 → 361.82] Because you'd just be setting up a communication layer so that DirectX can, like...
[361.82 → 363.42] I mean, DirectX would be an issue.
[363.60 → 363.98] Yeah.
[364.26 → 364.94] I would think so.
[365.00 → 370.70] And Microsoft would have exactly zero motivation to facilitate this.
[370.70 → 370.80] Yeah.
[370.80 → 374.18] There's a decent amount of games that can run in open...
[374.18 → 377.34] That can run with OpenGL, even if they are DirectX-based.
[377.36 → 377.58] Yeah.
[377.78 → 378.36] Or Vulcan.
[379.02 → 380.24] But even Vulcan.
[380.34 → 381.44] I'm not aware of any Vulcan support for...
[381.44 → 382.86] There are very few Vulcan games.
[382.86 → 383.42] ...macOS.
[383.92 → 384.78] Yeah, I don't know.
[385.10 → 385.98] That's going to be an issue.
[386.12 → 387.24] But, like, it's...
[387.24 → 388.42] I could see them doing something.
[388.54 → 390.50] And, again, it's Apple.
[390.74 → 394.82] So I would be very surprised if they even cared about making it compatible with all the games.
[394.82 → 399.56] Yeah, maybe they just wouldn't care about, you know, your Doom or your Counter-Strike or whatever the case may be.
[399.56 → 402.72] Maybe as long as they've got, like, FIFA...
[402.72 → 404.02] They might care about Counter-Strike.
[404.18 → 406.80] Because I bet you Steam would work with them.
[407.68 → 408.86] I bet you Steam would work with them.
[409.12 → 410.00] Okay, yeah, Valve would probably care.
[410.00 → 412.20] Because Steam likes being, like, all the platforms.
[412.32 → 413.22] Yeah, that's true.
[413.44 → 419.68] I mean, they were one of the first to really make even some kind of effort to bring gaming to Apple.
[419.68 → 424.78] Back before Apple had clued into, like, that gaming was a multi-billion dollar a year industry.
[425.50 → 428.28] So, yeah, I think they would probably try to get Data.
[428.54 → 430.94] They would probably try to get Counter-Strike.
[431.32 → 431.60] Sure.
[431.66 → 432.36] Both of those games.
[432.84 → 433.62] Steam, Valve.
[433.78 → 435.20] I don't think big issue there.
[435.88 → 439.76] I think they could get most of the big esports games.
[439.76 → 441.42] So let's move on in the discussion.
[441.42 → 449.90] And let's say, assuming then, that Apple gets the software compatibility figured out to the point where there are enough gaming experiences on the platform.
[449.98 → 454.80] I mean, they've shown that they're willing to dump in the kind of money, like they did with their Apple Arcade.
[455.38 → 455.44] Yeah.
[455.44 → 463.68] Like, they will just basically hand gigantic sackfuls of money to game developers and say, okay, make a game.
[463.76 → 464.64] We need games.
[464.84 → 466.02] Like, bring it on.
[466.08 → 466.52] We want games.
[466.82 → 468.56] So they've shown a willingness to do that.
[468.60 → 478.00] So let's assume that Apple manages to create, through partnerships or through just basically buying Game Studio time, enough content for their platform.
[478.56 → 479.90] Let's talk about the hardware.
[480.68 → 481.24] Yeah.
[481.24 → 487.18] What could possibly make someone buy an Apple gaming machine?
[487.24 → 488.92] And let's approach it two different ways, okay?
[489.38 → 490.72] Let's start with the laptop.
[491.32 → 494.62] What could motivate you to buy an Apple gaming laptop?
[496.08 → 498.14] I don't want to.
[498.38 → 498.68] Okay.
[499.12 → 502.58] Motivating me to buy a gaming laptop in the first place is going to be really hard.
[503.00 → 507.26] Very recently, my Racer Blade just decided it doesn't have a battery anymore.
[507.58 → 508.38] I don't know why.
[508.88 → 510.44] They're pretty much all dying now.
[510.56 → 510.76] Yeah.
[510.76 → 511.12] Yeah.
[511.32 → 512.42] Like, John's is dead.
[512.68 → 513.12] Okay.
[513.28 → 514.48] Dennis' screen flickers.
[514.60 → 516.42] At this point, it's kind of been a little while.
[516.48 → 517.12] It's been three years.
[517.20 → 518.30] I don't think that's really enough.
[518.96 → 519.76] That's fair.
[520.04 → 520.24] Okay.
[520.24 → 523.20] I mean, when I used to sell laptops, I told people to expect only three years.
[523.24 → 523.58] Fair enough.
[523.86 → 525.50] And it is a gaming laptop.
[525.66 → 525.82] Right.
[525.82 → 530.36] So you're just not surprised because you are inherently biased against laptops.
[530.92 → 531.28] Yeah.
[531.90 → 533.92] I don't like gaming laptops.
[534.54 → 535.70] I don't like that segment.
[536.32 → 537.16] Oh, your mic pack.
[537.32 → 538.06] My prompter remote.
[538.06 → 538.72] Oh, nice.
[538.72 → 542.64] I always expect gaming laptops to fail early.
[543.60 → 544.18] I just...
[544.18 → 544.70] Fail hard.
[544.92 → 545.22] Yeah.
[545.40 → 545.70] Okay.
[545.70 → 549.38] I worked in retail selling computers for a while, and I just saw the amount...
[549.38 → 553.96] Not as long as you did, but I just saw the amount of failure in the gaming laptop segment.
[553.96 → 554.34] Fair enough.
[554.34 → 558.22] And failure in laptops in general was already really high.
[559.02 → 566.12] And I can tell you now that even as a computer salesman when I was working, if people came
[566.12 → 570.38] in, and they wanted to buy a $3,000 gaming laptop, I would usually try to convince them
[570.38 → 573.14] to buy a basic laptop and a sick gaming rig.
[573.14 → 573.54] Yes.
[573.74 → 574.22] I'd be like...
[574.22 → 575.72] That's the exact move I tried to play.
[575.78 → 583.64] Because especially back then, like remember, I was working in the retail store in like 2008, 2007.
[584.18 → 586.96] Like back then, gaming laptops were a joke.
[587.08 → 588.46] Like they've gotten a lot better.
[588.50 → 588.92] They have.
[589.02 → 589.36] In fairness.
[589.36 → 590.84] And I will give them that for sure.
[590.84 → 592.06] They've gotten a lot better.
[592.14 → 592.28] Yeah.
[592.50 → 593.02] But...
[593.02 → 593.88] They used to be...
[593.88 → 594.26] So, okay.
[594.26 → 595.24] They're big right now.
[595.40 → 596.96] They used to be giant.
[597.40 → 597.58] Yeah.
[597.74 → 601.54] Like you'd have to get these backpacks that had these massive compartments.
[601.58 → 603.26] Literally 20-minute battery.
[603.62 → 604.02] Yeah.
[604.08 → 605.10] Like when it was new.
[605.10 → 605.12] That too.
[605.54 → 608.28] If you're playing a game, like it was not a good time.
[608.36 → 608.52] No.
[611.04 → 614.50] My old bamboo laptop, say what you will, still works.
[615.00 → 615.58] That's true.
[616.18 → 618.40] And there was a guy who bought an...
[618.40 → 619.16] Sorry, Asus.
[619.40 → 622.10] There was a guy who bought an Asus gaming laptop around the same time as me.
[622.26 → 622.42] Yeah.
[622.42 → 628.64] Before the end of that year of school, not the semester, but the year of school, his laptop was dead.
[629.50 → 632.64] And my laptop from that same time frame still works.
[633.10 → 635.40] So like, I just, I don't know.
[635.86 → 637.88] That's way too small of a sample size.
[638.00 → 642.16] But like, I just, I would be way more interested if there was an external GPU.
[642.52 → 642.80] Fine.
[643.08 → 645.22] Let's go, let's talk about the AIO.
[645.38 → 649.56] Because personally, I consider that to be more realistic anyway.
[649.86 → 650.12] Okay.
[650.12 → 653.20] Oh, like, so you think it's going to, okay.
[653.42 → 657.18] If it was going to be something, I think it's going to be an AIO, or it's going to be both.
[657.30 → 659.24] I don't think they just do a gaming laptop.
[660.18 → 662.76] So gaming AIO from laptop, from Apple.
[662.92 → 665.22] Let's talk what kinds of specs we might expect.
[665.56 → 670.46] There's no way that it's going to be HEAT because that Intel doesn't even position those as gaming processors,
[670.46 → 674.10] as gaming devices, gaming processors anyway.
[674.52 → 679.42] So it'll be something, whatever the 10th gen equivalent of a 9900K is.
[679.52 → 682.12] So that's a $350, $400 processor.
[682.64 → 683.88] I promise soon, Nick.
[683.94 → 685.42] Sorry, let me just, let's get through this topic.
[685.42 → 689.10] So it's a $400 processor.
[689.92 → 693.52] You're going to need, you know, a hundred bucks or a couple of hundred bucks for some RAM.
[694.04 → 696.00] They're going to put a decent display on it.
[696.30 → 701.16] You know, Apple has dabbled in high refresh rate displays, like on the iPad Pro, for example.
[701.32 → 703.32] So I think they do a high refresh rate display.
[703.64 → 705.54] I think we don't get a Radeon Pro.
[705.54 → 710.26] I think we just get, you know, standard RX whatever graphics.
[710.50 → 710.58] Yeah.
[711.02 → 712.08] They'll have nice storage.
[712.22 → 713.48] It'll be a few hundred dollars more.
[713.60 → 716.00] It'll have fine storage.
[716.76 → 721.72] So I think Apple's actual parts cost ends up in the neighbourhood of, like, you know,
[722.16 → 725.44] two grand for what is effectively, like, a decent gaming rig.
[725.84 → 730.14] And then remember, too, if it's going to top out at five grand, it probably starts at around $3,500.
[730.54 → 733.12] So they could make a healthy margin on something like that.
[733.14 → 733.78] Oh, up to five grand.
[733.86 → 734.02] Okay.
[734.02 → 734.84] Yeah, up to five grand.
[734.90 → 738.50] And I'd imagine that's with, like, a ton of RAM and a ton of storage.
[741.74 → 752.24] So it'll have kind of crummy specs for the price, assuming that they target around, you
[752.24 → 753.70] know, $3,500 starting price.
[753.80 → 756.50] If they do $2,999, it might not even be that bad.
[757.30 → 760.94] It'll have said what you will about Apple's reliability and customer support.
[760.94 → 763.56] It'll have Apple's reliability and customer support.
[764.02 → 767.96] It'll have a colour accurate, like, probably very high quality display.
[769.96 → 772.94] And it'll, like, perform fine.
[772.94 → 781.46] So this, I wonder if this would revive the segment of, like, kids convincing their parents to buy a computer because it's cool for them, too.
[782.14 → 784.84] Which, like, I think hasn't really been a thing for a while.
[785.08 → 785.90] Oh, interesting.
[785.90 → 787.68] So, you know what?
[787.78 → 792.28] If you need a new computer, dad, then this Mac can do...
[792.28 → 793.38] Get this one.
[793.42 → 795.70] You can do really cool design work on it or whatever.
[795.70 → 802.04] So let's fire up Apple's website here because maybe, honestly, maybe we're overthinking this.
[802.34 → 805.24] Maybe it's just a matter of going to Apple.com.
[806.48 → 807.48] Seeing what a $5,000...
[807.48 → 809.22] Finding a Mac.
[809.38 → 809.60] Yeah.
[809.60 → 811.64] So here, where's the iMac?
[811.86 → 812.86] Because it's not going to be iMac Pro.
[812.98 → 813.64] That's H-E-D-T.
[813.78 → 814.90] Or, excuse me, that's Workstation.
[815.14 → 817.30] But basically the same business, different pile.
[818.48 → 820.06] Okay, let's buy an iMac.
[822.22 → 824.36] Did you guys finish working on it in time?
[825.10 → 825.34] Which?
[825.34 → 826.28] Did you return the...
[826.28 → 827.64] No, we're stuck with it for now.
[827.64 → 831.74] Okay.
[832.14 → 832.34] Okay.
[833.30 → 834.14] So...
[834.14 → 835.22] Those are starting prices, yeah?
[835.38 → 835.70] Yeah.
[836.02 → 838.76] So pretty much, I mean, the...
[838.76 → 843.20] If they just bumped the graphics card, right?
[843.38 → 851.76] So instead of a Radeon Pro 580X, we get like a, you know, $5,700 or something like that.
[851.98 → 854.52] Maybe that actually only puts us to $2,500.
[854.98 → 855.60] So what do we get?
[855.68 → 856.84] We get 8 gigs of RAM.
[856.84 → 859.42] We get a 2 terabyte Fusion Drive.
[859.92 → 862.24] We get a Core i5 6 core processor.
[863.62 → 866.32] We get maybe not a Retina 5K display.
[866.78 → 867.94] Maybe we get like...
[867.94 → 871.74] Because remember, Apple has like custom timing controllers and stuff.
[871.82 → 875.92] So they could potentially do 4K 120Hz or maybe even higher.
[876.28 → 879.08] Maybe they do 4K 240Hz for all I know or whatever.
[880.42 → 883.44] We get a couple of Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[883.44 → 893.20] I mean, is that a terrible gaming computer that mom can also, you know, look up her Facebook and, you know, her iMovie or whatever?
[893.20 → 898.12] But it'll do more than fine in basically all esports games right now.
[898.12 → 900.02] So they put a space gray.
[900.20 → 901.88] You know, they put a dark chassis on it.
[901.94 → 902.16] Yep.
[902.68 → 903.72] Put like...
[903.72 → 906.12] I don't know if Apple would ever do like a lighting effect.
[907.90 → 908.62] I don't think so.
[908.68 → 910.44] Maybe they do like a cool backing on it.
[910.52 → 911.60] Maybe they update the ID.
[911.60 → 913.98] They do lighting effects because they light up the Apple logo.
[914.30 → 914.62] Yeah.
[915.02 → 916.68] But that's like back when that was cool.
[916.76 → 917.72] Now it's not cool anymore.
[917.80 → 918.74] They haven't done that in a while.
[918.92 → 919.20] Okay.
[919.30 → 921.24] It's been a hot minute since they've done that.
[921.36 → 921.52] Yeah.
[921.66 → 922.38] So...
[922.38 → 925.22] It would be kind of cool if they brought it back, and it was RGB.
[925.48 → 927.00] And remember, here's another thing.
[927.24 → 929.20] This gaming Mac.
[930.20 → 935.62] Basically, all you have to change about a computer to make it gaming is put a decent graphics card in it.
[935.84 → 935.98] Yeah.
[936.14 → 937.18] We all know that.
[937.60 → 941.28] So this gaming Mac, all they have to do is update the ID a little bit.
[942.70 → 946.70] Maybe they put a better graphics card in it to start.
[946.82 → 947.46] Maybe they don't even.
[947.70 → 949.14] Maybe they just start at 580X.
[949.18 → 950.32] It's not like it's incapable of gaming.
[950.60 → 950.84] Yeah.
[951.02 → 951.14] Yeah.
[952.64 → 957.70] And then even if you wanted to run Windows only games, it's not like boot camp isn't a thing that exists.
[957.70 → 959.86] Ooh, I don't think they'd do that.
[960.82 → 961.06] No.
[961.48 → 963.44] Like it wouldn't go by default or anything.
[963.66 → 963.98] But it's like...
[963.98 → 965.08] Oh, as a user.
[965.22 → 965.72] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[965.80 → 966.06] Yeah.
[966.22 → 969.00] Like it's not like you can't do that.
[969.08 → 973.50] So they could, with a straight face, say, hey, we built all these partnerships.
[973.86 → 975.32] You can play all these games.
[975.90 → 984.86] The performance is, you know, however much better than the non-gaming Mac because that's definitely the comparison they'd want to draw.
[984.86 → 992.88] And it starts at only $24.99 for a gaming computer with the monitor, with everything.
[993.00 → 993.64] It's all included.
[993.74 → 994.52] It's ready to rock.
[994.68 → 998.72] It's got a 200Hz refresh rate 4K display for the greatest graphics.
[999.24 → 1000.54] Here's a bit of an interesting question too.
[1001.18 → 1001.62] Peripherals.
[1003.54 → 1003.84] Ooh.
[1004.14 → 1005.80] iMac, they always give you mouse and keyboard.
[1005.80 → 1010.08] What would an Apple gaming keyboard look like?
[1010.08 → 1010.10] I don't know.
[1010.10 → 1014.58] Like, is that, like, does anyone on Apple's design team game?
[1015.90 → 1022.54] Like, do they venture out of their own cavities to see what, you know, the rest of the world is doing?
[1022.72 → 1024.64] I mean, I realize I must be generalizing.
[1024.64 → 1037.54] It's just everyone at Apple just has a way of making sure that everyone who actually is public facing has their nose so far up their own butt that you just, like, you can't take them seriously as, like, actual people.
[1038.14 → 1038.30] Yeah.
[1038.82 → 1039.16] Yeah.
[1039.32 → 1040.12] That's kind of true.
[1041.28 → 1044.76] Like, I just, I have a hard time imagining them just, like.
[1045.06 → 1048.94] All I have ever done in my entire life and all I ever do in my free time is design.
[1048.94 → 1050.46] I live and breathe design.
[1050.52 → 1050.70] Yeah.
[1050.70 → 1051.98] It's like, okay.
[1052.16 → 1052.52] Okay.
[1052.52 → 1053.52] Yeah, sure.
[1055.12 → 1055.94] Yeah, I don't know.
[1056.08 → 1057.92] I think the peripherals would be very interesting.
[1058.06 → 1060.56] I would be kind of surprised if they just shipped standard ones.
[1060.64 → 1063.88] And, like, watching Apple's upper brass talk about gaming.
[1066.34 → 1067.08] It's like.
[1068.48 → 1071.06] Have you ever even played, like, People?
[1071.06 → 1073.64] It's actually, like, competitive gaming, not phone gaming.
[1073.90 → 1078.28] Because they're, I don't even remember what it's called at this point, but their mobile phone gaming thing.
[1079.96 → 1080.58] Which one?
[1080.88 → 1081.78] Just the service.
[1081.98 → 1082.40] Arcade.
[1082.52 → 1082.88] Arcade.
[1083.00 → 1083.14] Yeah.
[1083.32 → 1085.98] That's an overly simple name that I can't believe I forgot.
[1086.10 → 1087.40] But anyway, Apple Arcade.
[1087.46 → 1088.64] I could see them talking about that.
[1089.18 → 1089.58] Yes.
[1089.76 → 1089.90] Yeah.
[1089.90 → 1091.94] Casual Norrie gaming.
[1092.42 → 1092.74] Ooh.
[1092.94 → 1093.18] Yeah.
[1093.44 → 1094.52] I've just never.
[1094.64 → 1098.12] And when they talk about things like augmented reality, and they bring up, like.
[1098.28 → 1100.68] They bring up game developers to do these demos.
[1100.82 → 1101.34] They're kind of like.
[1101.74 → 1102.78] The heck is that?
[1102.78 → 1103.84] Like, ooh, ooh, cool.
[1103.98 → 1104.72] Like, it looks like.
[1104.80 → 1108.42] It looks like my, you know, my grandpa trying gaming for the first time.
[1108.42 → 1108.78] Like, I just.
[1108.86 → 1109.14] It just.
[1109.98 → 1111.34] It's not credible.
[1112.88 → 1114.00] So, I just.
[1114.12 → 1114.48] I have.
[1114.74 → 1117.88] They must have people internally who get it.
[1118.08 → 1119.30] I mean, Anand works there.
[1119.82 → 1120.48] I was going to say.
[1120.48 → 1121.84] There's going to be.
[1121.92 → 1122.76] They're a big enough company.
[1122.88 → 1125.62] There's going to be enough people there that get it.
[1125.72 → 1126.18] But, like.
[1127.54 → 1128.96] Who's making the actual decisions?
[1128.96 → 1129.34] Exactly.
[1129.42 → 1130.18] That's the tough thing.
[1130.28 → 1130.42] Yeah.
[1130.42 → 1132.62] I mean, maybe what we end up.
[1132.72 → 1137.32] Do we end up with, like, a magic mouse that's, like, lower latency?
[1137.66 → 1138.64] Because Apple has.
[1138.80 → 1142.58] Like, they have so much engineering resources at their disposal.
[1142.80 → 1147.52] That if Apple did a gaming PC, I believe they could do a great gaming PC.
[1148.04 → 1152.74] I mean, you look at the way that they improve the latency over Bluetooth on their devices.
[1152.74 → 1154.28] It's like, wow.
[1154.76 → 1158.52] You guys actually do something with the R&D money that you spend.
[1158.58 → 1160.20] They spend huge money on R&D.
[1160.42 → 1166.06] But, like, if all we got was a magic mouse that's, like, lower latency and black or something.
[1166.24 → 1167.22] It's like, oh, God.
[1167.24 → 1170.80] I just know, like, way back, even in the keyboard head community.
[1171.06 → 1171.34] Yeah.
[1171.48 → 1175.60] There was a certain amount of respect for the Apple desktop keyboards.
[1178.42 → 1178.90] Yeah.
[1179.14 → 1179.46] There was.
[1179.46 → 1179.98] I think that's.
[1180.26 → 1180.50] Okay.
[1180.58 → 1181.20] That respect.
[1181.20 → 1181.54] There was.
[1181.54 → 1183.42] I sometimes think you respect what you're used to.
[1183.94 → 1184.40] Sure.
[1184.54 → 1184.86] But, like.
[1184.94 → 1185.74] They're not amazing.
[1186.48 → 1190.04] From quite a ways back, if you were going for pure typing speed,
[1190.04 → 1191.32] a lot of people used them.
[1192.08 → 1192.42] Okay.
[1192.62 → 1193.18] That's true.
[1193.30 → 1194.06] Really short travel.
[1194.18 → 1194.88] Laptop style.
[1195.10 → 1196.42] That's the one you're talking about, right?
[1196.42 → 1196.56] Yeah.
[1196.76 → 1196.96] Yeah.
[1196.96 → 1197.28] Okay.
[1197.36 → 1197.60] Fair enough.
[1197.60 → 1203.80] I'm not necessarily saying on the like, the gaming side of the keyboard enthusiast community.
[1203.80 → 1212.32] But, like, purely typists, a lot of them really liked the old desktop but laptop style Apple keyboards.
[1212.32 → 1212.60] Yeah.
[1212.60 → 1215.50] And it was a really solid keyboard.
[1216.36 → 1217.94] They could do something cool.
[1218.44 → 1219.32] I just, I don't know.
[1219.62 → 1220.64] I'm being very hopeful.
[1221.14 → 1222.94] I, they could very likely screw it up.
[1222.94 → 1224.14] But I'm being very hopeful.
[1224.36 → 1232.34] They could also just pull an Apple and decide that they're going to dictate the terms of how gaming computers are made instead of listening to customer feedback.
[1232.64 → 1232.82] Yeah.
[1232.82 → 1233.08] Yeah.
[1233.08 → 1234.62] Um, yeah.
[1234.68 → 1235.00] I don't know.
[1235.10 → 1243.44] I think the pricing could end up being reasonable because in Apple's lower end products, like, things like the Mac Mini, the Mac Mini starting price is not unreasonable.
[1244.24 → 1245.84] Like, we just picked up another Mac Mini.
[1245.96 → 1248.80] We've got a new designer starting, and they're a Mac person.
[1248.92 → 1251.70] And I'm like, yeah, Mac Mini, like, like, kind of awesome.
[1252.16 → 1254.38] It's like around $1,000 to start US.
[1254.40 → 1255.02] Jaden likes them.
[1255.50 → 1259.00] Um, it's got, like, fine enough specs.
[1259.00 → 1263.76] You can get it with 10 gig LAN if that's important to you, like, if you're working with large files over the network or whatever else.
[1263.94 → 1264.04] Yeah.
[1264.10 → 1268.26] Like, it's like kind of all the, all the Mac computer I could ever need.
[1269.02 → 1271.74] Like, if you want to run the OS, it's a great entry level.
[1272.32 → 1278.40] And, I mean, even the iMac is not entirely unreasonable for a high quality 27-inch display, Core i5.
[1278.62 → 1279.54] Like, oh, Fusion Drive.
[1279.62 → 1280.30] That's pretty gross.
[1280.38 → 1282.30] Every computer should have an SSD in this day and age.
[1282.30 → 1286.78] There are a couple of things on here that, like, I wouldn't, they're almost certainly going to have an i7 option.
[1287.64 → 1288.04] Yeah.
[1288.04 → 1288.52] Um.
[1289.00 → 1290.52] The RAM's a little low.
[1291.34 → 1291.78] Yeah.
[1291.98 → 1294.02] I'm sure they're going to have an NVMe drive option.
[1296.06 → 1300.84] I could see it starting around $2,500 or $3,000 with specs that are not embarrassing.
[1301.34 → 1301.50] Yeah.
[1302.24 → 1312.08] And if they figure out a couple of Apple differentiating points, like that it has a super high refresh rate 4K display or something, then I think there's a case to be made for it.
[1312.14 → 1313.66] They'll have some really cool name for it.
[1313.70 → 1315.76] Some really cool exclusive titles or something like that.
[1315.80 → 1316.60] They might get away with it.
[1316.60 → 1317.10] Yeah.
[1317.10 → 1317.60] Yeah.
[1317.60 → 1320.26] Moving on to our next topic for the day.
[1320.26 → 1323.96] Oh, actually, moving on to some LTT store updates.
[1323.96 → 1326.14] Do we have, is, Nick was holding something.
[1326.14 → 1327.14] Uh, yes.
[1327.14 → 1327.36] What's up, dude?
[1327.36 → 1327.86] Yes.
[1327.86 → 1328.96] Sorry, sorry, Nick.
[1328.96 → 1329.96] Hey, what's up, dude?
[1329.96 → 1333.26] So LTT Stealth hoodie is back in stock in every size.
[1333.40 → 1334.90] Ram t-shirt is back in stock.
[1335.06 → 1336.40] Processor is back in stock.
[1336.92 → 1338.16] Um, what's the one that's coming?
[1338.26 → 1339.90] GPU is coming next week.
[1340.10 → 1340.26] Yeah.
[1340.96 → 1345.96] Uh, and we have a new design that's coming next week that I was actually supposed to wear on the show today.
[1346.20 → 1346.74] No, that's good.
[1346.74 → 1347.36] We didn't wear it.
[1347.40 → 1347.68] It's fine.
[1347.96 → 1348.24] Oh.
[1348.36 → 1349.04] Wear it next week.
[1349.04 → 1350.04] Should I not talk about it?
[1350.46 → 1351.74] Well, wear it next week when we have it.
[1351.74 → 1352.00] Oh, yeah.
[1352.06 → 1353.12] Wear it next week when we have it.
[1353.22 → 1354.20] It's, oh, it's not on the store.
[1354.36 → 1354.54] Okay.
[1354.54 → 1354.90] Fine.
[1354.98 → 1357.64] We should totally show this to see if people like it.
[1357.70 → 1358.24] All right.
[1358.32 → 1358.66] All right.
[1358.66 → 1359.44] You're not convinced.
[1359.44 → 1362.22] Nick and I are having a bit of a debate right now.
[1362.98 → 1367.70] We designed, like, team shirts for our staff to wear at CES.
[1367.92 → 1368.20] Okay.
[1368.62 → 1374.92] Um, they ended up being kind of cool, but I think they're kind of corporate looking.
[1375.18 → 1375.46] Okay.
[1375.46 → 1378.72] And so I said, look, I think they're kind of corporate.
[1378.82 → 1380.36] I don't think it makes sense to sell them.
[1380.50 → 1383.80] And Nick said, if people like it, why shouldn't we sell it?
[1383.80 → 1385.92] Without, without seeing it yet, I will say.
[1386.22 → 1386.48] Yeah.
[1386.48 → 1392.58] The shirts that are often very, very sought after, definitely from me, are any form of,
[1392.58 → 1394.72] like, staff or crew shirt.
[1395.08 → 1396.76] It doesn't say staff or crew, though.
[1396.78 → 1397.16] No, I know.
[1397.22 → 1399.84] But if it looks, like, really official, it could be all right.
[1400.00 → 1400.44] I don't know.
[1400.52 → 1400.86] All right.
[1400.90 → 1401.46] I'll show it to you.
[1401.48 → 1403.68] I'll show it to you first and then the audience.
[1404.34 → 1406.32] And I just want to get your reaction first.
[1407.04 → 1407.26] Okay.
[1407.30 → 1407.88] So that's the front.
[1408.04 → 1408.34] Okay.
[1410.04 → 1410.68] That's the back.
[1410.80 → 1411.16] Oh, wow.
[1411.52 → 1411.84] Okay.
[1412.42 → 1412.72] Okay.
[1414.42 → 1415.30] Out of 10.
[1416.48 → 1419.48] Six.
[1422.22 → 1422.70] All right.
[1422.92 → 1423.26] Okay.
[1423.44 → 1425.48] So we'll take your guys' feedback now.
[1425.58 → 1425.64] Sorry.
[1425.64 → 1426.08] That's fine.
[1430.08 → 1430.64] There's the front.
[1434.52 → 1435.52] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1435.52 → 1442.06] I will also say the only reason why I'm giving it, like, a six is because I think stuff like
[1442.06 → 1448.52] GPU and especially, like, processor are so cool.
[1448.92 → 1449.38] Right.
[1449.82 → 1454.88] See, that's the thing is I don't think it has the sex appeal, but we'll take the audience's
[1454.88 → 1455.16] feedback.
[1455.16 → 1457.70] We should straw poll it.
[1457.78 → 1458.32] One out of 10.
[1458.38 → 1460.22] The entire chat is World War III.
[1460.22 → 1463.78] So thank you all for that.
[1464.18 → 1464.40] Thanks.
[1464.76 → 1465.16] Great.
[1465.80 → 1466.16] Cool.
[1466.96 → 1468.08] Rate the shirt.
[1468.54 → 1468.94] Yeah.
[1469.04 → 1469.42] One.
[1469.64 → 1470.02] All right.
[1470.08 → 1471.48] Luke's setting up a straw poll, guys.
[1471.56 → 1472.42] We're setting up a straw poll.
[1472.42 → 1475.46] In the meantime, I'm going to move on to our next topic here.
[1476.74 → 1477.64] Buy the shirts.
[1477.78 → 1478.26] They're cool.
[1478.52 → 1478.74] Yeah.
[1478.80 → 1479.48] Thanks, Nick.
[1479.48 → 1479.84] Yeah.
[1481.84 → 1483.92] I think it's pretty tepid, Nick.
[1484.22 → 1484.60] All right.
[1484.86 → 1486.58] Based on YouTube chat, anyway.
[1487.06 → 1488.12] I'll have a look at Flow plane.
[1488.28 → 1489.32] They tend to be a little more trouble.
[1489.48 → 1489.84] Ooh.
[1490.76 → 1491.20] Four.
[1491.64 → 1492.00] Four.
[1492.34 → 1492.72] Six.
[1492.90 → 1493.38] Six.
[1493.68 → 1494.74] Seven to eight.
[1496.28 → 1498.52] No 10 out of 10, though, ladies and gentlemen.
[1498.74 → 1499.10] Five.
[1499.42 → 1499.66] Six.
[1499.78 → 1500.00] Seven.
[1500.16 → 1500.52] Five.
[1500.62 → 1500.90] Seven.
[1500.90 → 1502.04] Okay, Flow plane got the poll.
[1502.16 → 1503.10] I'm going to Twitch now.
[1503.20 → 1504.24] Then I'm going to YouTube soon.
[1504.26 → 1504.50] All right.
[1505.22 → 1505.42] Yeah.
[1505.42 → 1508.56] We'll see how they feel after they see it during all of our CS content.
[1508.58 → 1508.94] Yeah.
[1508.94 → 1511.68] That honestly might pump it a little bit more.
[1511.90 → 1512.02] Yeah.
[1513.08 → 1513.82] All right.
[1513.88 → 1518.62] So this was posted by Delicious on the forum.
[1520.20 → 1522.96] California's new data and privacy rights go into effect.
[1523.24 → 1528.36] So in the absence of strong national legislation, California has enacted a landmark privacy law
[1528.36 → 1533.56] known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect two days
[1533.56 → 1534.88] ago on January 1st.
[1534.98 → 1538.84] It was passed unanimously in June 2018, and it's the first law in the U.S. to set up a
[1538.84 → 1542.46] comprehensive set of rules around consumer data, kind of like the EU's GDPR.
[1542.46 → 1548.14] It applies to any company that operates in California and either makes at least $25 million in annual
[1548.14 → 1553.90] revenue, gathers data on more than 50,000 users, or makes more than half of its money
[1553.90 → 1554.96] off of user data.
[1554.96 → 1560.70] So basically, it's not designed for your little tiny startups that are just getting off the
[1560.70 → 1560.96] ground.
[1560.96 → 1561.36] Yeah.
[1561.36 → 1568.98] It seems like it's firmly targeting firms that are kind of, they've got their stuff together.
[1569.14 → 1572.20] They can afford to follow this law.
[1572.20 → 1576.64] So for California residents, it creates a handful of new rights over their data, notably the
[1576.64 → 1579.08] right to know and the right to say no.
[1579.48 → 1583.82] So users can see what data companies have gathered about them, have that data deleted,
[1583.82 → 1587.62] and opt out of those companies selling it to third parties from now on.
[1588.08 → 1589.68] So here's an example.
[1589.88 → 1593.98] If you're reading a Wired.com article from a California IP address, you'll see a pop-up
[1593.98 → 1597.20] with a big button reading, do not sell my personal information.
[1597.20 → 1604.36] So we make a VPN company exclusively with servers in California.
[1607.50 → 1610.84] It's not actually a terrible business idea.
[1611.44 → 1615.84] I mean, you could just use any other VPN and just use a California server.
[1615.84 → 1616.58] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1616.62 → 1617.88] Minor details, Luke.
[1619.84 → 1625.28] So anyway, if you click that button, like, it's not like Wired was going to immediately
[1625.28 → 1627.56] sell your data, like, there.
[1627.66 → 1630.64] Like, no one is just, like, giving them cash in exchange for user data.
[1630.74 → 1632.52] But they track your behaviour.
[1632.92 → 1636.82] What articles you read, for how long, et cetera, on Wired.com using cookies.
[1636.90 → 1639.94] And that information can go to a third-party vendor like Google AdSense, which combines
[1639.94 → 1644.42] it with similar data from other sites, to create a user profile for you that advertisers can target.
[1644.66 → 1648.26] So you know how that shoe ad can follow you all over the web?
[1649.82 → 1650.78] That's how that works.
[1650.78 → 1654.84] So if you ask Wired.com to stop selling your data, you won't get those types of ads from
[1654.84 → 1655.36] them anymore.
[1655.54 → 1659.72] And your browser history on Wired won't factor into the types of ads you see elsewhere.
[1660.86 → 1662.36] Now, right now, there's no enforcement.
[1662.62 → 1664.32] That's going to start on July 1st.
[1664.40 → 1666.32] And the final regulations haven't been released.
[1666.44 → 1671.00] So it's an open question whether the enforcement will be robust enough for the law
[1671.00 → 1673.62] to actually make an impact, for anyone to actually stop doing this.
[1673.78 → 1673.88] Right.
[1674.18 → 1678.26] It grants Californians the right to sue companies for failing to take reasonable precautions
[1678.26 → 1679.58] to prevent data breaches, though.
[1680.40 → 1683.02] And also make sure that companies comply with the...
[1683.02 → 1686.76] Oh, and making sure that companies comply with the CCPA is the sole province of the
[1686.76 → 1690.26] attorney's attorney general's office, which has indicated it will only have the bandwidth
[1690.26 → 1691.80] to bring a handful of cases each year.
[1691.94 → 1697.26] At a certain point, web companies are going to have departments that are entirely
[1697.26 → 1698.26] dedicated to...
[1698.94 → 1702.06] Complying with all the different consumer data protection.
[1702.06 → 1705.98] From all over the world and every different state and every different province.
[1706.18 → 1707.48] I'm not saying this is a bad thing.
[1707.48 → 1708.94] This actually sounds wonderful.
[1709.38 → 1710.12] But like...
[1710.12 → 1712.66] We're already running into this with taxation on Flow plane.
[1713.32 → 1715.40] We're running into this with everything on Flow plane.
[1715.48 → 1715.64] Yeah.
[1715.84 → 1718.84] Just the amount of like different angles, different new laws are coming from.
[1718.96 → 1720.12] Like it's tough.
[1720.38 → 1723.22] And like it's not pointed towards startup, whatever.
[1723.34 → 1724.46] You still have to be ready for it.
[1724.56 → 1724.76] Yep.
[1725.12 → 1731.08] And honestly, 50,000 users, like $25 million revenue or over half of your revenue coming
[1731.08 → 1731.86] from user data.
[1732.16 → 1733.86] Those make a ton of sense to me.
[1734.00 → 1734.22] Yeah.
[1734.22 → 1736.86] 50,000 users is not a lot.
[1737.00 → 1737.16] Yeah.
[1737.36 → 1738.62] The other two make sense.
[1738.68 → 1742.72] Especially when you're doing, you know, like a big user drive where you're making your
[1742.72 → 1744.36] service free to use at first.
[1744.46 → 1746.86] You know, like Dropbox did way back in the day.
[1746.94 → 1751.48] Like you had a lot of really great features in Dropbox and on the free tier.
[1751.74 → 1751.86] Yeah.
[1751.86 → 1753.56] And now it's not anymore.
[1753.68 → 1756.54] It's much more locked down because they've established themselves.
[1757.28 → 1762.12] And so, you know, to me, 50,000 users, you know, you could do a soft launch and have 50,000
[1762.12 → 1762.86] users overnight.
[1763.18 → 1767.32] And that doesn't necessarily mean like you're in scramble mode figuring out everything else
[1767.32 → 1767.64] at that point.
[1767.64 → 1769.10] How do you define a user?
[1769.10 → 1771.46] That's way too vague in my opinion.
[1773.46 → 1773.94] Interesting.
[1774.38 → 1775.02] Go on.
[1776.00 → 1777.78] Is it someone who visited the website at all?
[1777.82 → 1779.04] They technically use the website.
[1779.60 → 1782.24] If they scrolled at all, does that count as using?
[1782.56 → 1784.64] Does go to the website at all count as using?
[1784.96 → 1786.06] Do they have to have an account?
[1786.72 → 1788.08] Do they have to pay?
[1788.42 → 1790.18] Like what defines a user?
[1790.60 → 1790.94] Right.
[1791.42 → 1792.64] I mean, it sounds to me.
[1792.64 → 1798.10] You differentiate like you could nuke, you could like bot traffic nuke a site with this.
[1798.58 → 1799.02] Right.
[1799.20 → 1801.20] No, 50,000 users.
[1801.32 → 1801.70] There you go.
[1801.78 → 1802.24] You're screwed.
[1802.36 → 1802.58] Lol.
[1803.64 → 1807.58] And then, you know, sue them for using the data or something.
[1807.74 → 1808.50] I see what you mean.
[1808.78 → 1810.34] So like it's, what is it?
[1810.48 → 1811.42] How do you define that?
[1811.64 → 1812.06] Too vague.
[1812.30 → 1812.90] Don't like it.
[1814.22 → 1816.68] I actually like the idea.
[1816.68 → 1817.04] Yeah.
[1817.28 → 1817.94] I like the idea.
[1818.06 → 1819.88] Well, remove the user's thing.
[1819.88 → 1823.40] Make it revenue or whatever the other one was.
[1823.46 → 1824.34] The first two that we liked.
[1824.58 → 1824.60] Yeah.
[1824.60 → 1827.32] Like over half of your revenue coming from user data.
[1827.42 → 1827.72] Sure.
[1828.30 → 1828.76] Nuke that.
[1828.86 → 1829.68] What was the other metric?
[1829.94 → 1830.82] Over a certain amount of money.
[1830.82 → 1832.64] It was over $25 million a year revenue.
[1832.68 → 1836.86] Both of those sound great because if you're making that much money, then you can figure this out.
[1836.88 → 1837.66] Well, yes and no.
[1837.80 → 1842.80] Because you could be doing $25 million a year revenue, but that doesn't necessarily mean,
[1842.90 → 1845.30] in the Silicon Valley model, you're not necessarily making any money.
[1845.30 → 1845.90] True.
[1846.10 → 1851.38] But if you're cycling that much through, you probably have the dev horsepower to make this.
[1851.44 → 1852.74] This doesn't sound way too complicated.
[1852.74 → 1856.20] I mean, really the thing though too is that it's not just dev.
[1856.28 → 1862.82] Like you said, it's going to come down to also needing to keep track of all these different regulations.
[1863.06 → 1866.98] And when you could be dealing with, like, if the Attorney General's office is already saying
[1866.98 → 1869.70] they're only going to be able to bring a handful of cases a year,
[1870.14 → 1872.54] like they're basically saying they're going after the whales.
[1872.88 → 1873.10] Yeah.
[1873.10 → 1880.74] I mean, what if one of the usual suspects, you know, your Facebook and Facebook's and Google's of the world,
[1880.80 → 1881.78] what if they don't do anything?
[1881.86 → 1888.26] And what if they make it all the way down the list to someone who isn't ready for it?
[1888.36 → 1889.70] Who this isn't really designed for.
[1889.70 → 1891.26] Who doesn't have a gigantic legal department?
[1891.72 → 1893.06] I don't know.
[1893.16 → 1897.92] If you are making a bunch of your revenue off of selling user data,
[1898.04 → 1899.88] then I don't really feel that bad.
[1900.06 → 1901.24] Just going to be completely honest.
[1901.24 → 1903.88] If there's anything that we've learned from our dealings with the CRA,
[1904.32 → 1906.92] a lot of the time when you're dealing with a government agency,
[1907.74 → 1911.66] it just, the spirit of the law doesn't matter at all.
[1911.76 → 1911.94] Yeah.
[1912.34 → 1914.60] Like it just, they just don't even care.
[1914.70 → 1916.00] You go, well, like, hold on.
[1916.68 → 1917.16] Backup.
[1917.42 → 1920.70] This was designed for Scenario X.
[1920.70 → 1926.20] And here are the ways in which what's going on here is very, very different from that.
[1926.30 → 1927.70] And therefore, it doesn't make sense.
[1929.02 → 1929.70] Don't care.
[1929.96 → 1930.20] And?
[1931.62 → 1933.10] They just don't care.
[1933.10 → 1942.12] So maybe the way that this law was designed to go after companies that really are just out there harvesting user data and making money off of it.
[1943.82 → 1945.28] Maybe it was designed for that.
[1945.36 → 1953.40] But maybe they end up grabbing someone who has 50,000 users and is just like barely scraping by or whatever.
[1953.40 → 1955.68] And they end up like going under.
[1955.78 → 1957.26] That's why I like the idea.
[1957.26 → 1959.46] I'm concerned about the execution.
[1959.70 → 1960.52] But I like the idea.
[1960.66 → 1976.96] And here's the thing, guys, is that you might say, okay, well, the real solution is for there to be enough of this legislation that's robust enough that collecting users' data and using it to advertise to them is just going to go away.
[1977.26 → 1982.46] I can tell you right now, unequivocally, that that will destroy the Internet as you know it.
[1982.46 → 2005.42] A banner ad on a website without any of the kind of performance metrics and tracking and effectiveness that Facebook and Google have effectively used to drive value for their business and for their customers is worth basically nothing now.
[2006.32 → 2007.42] Like nothing.
[2007.42 → 2022.32] So every website you use, every content creator that you view pretty much wouldn't exist without the evolution of advertising that has taken place on the web.
[2022.46 → 2025.26] And we're not saying whether you're okay with that.
[2025.40 → 2026.72] You might be okay with that.
[2026.74 → 2027.62] You might be totally okay with that.
[2027.70 → 2029.74] But it will change the landscape of the Internet.
[2030.16 → 2032.34] Whether you think that's good or bad is entirely up to you.
[2032.34 → 2036.42] With that said, I mean, doomsayers have said things like that before.
[2036.42 → 2038.36] I mean, about things like AdBlock.
[2038.76 → 2041.50] AdBlock still hasn't destroyed the Internet as you know it.
[2041.90 → 2044.70] Unless, I mean, journalism is taking a bit of a beating.
[2044.92 → 2045.14] Yeah.
[2046.20 → 2046.96] So there is that.
[2047.04 → 2051.62] AdBlock has, I would argue that AdBlock has substantially changed the Internet.
[2051.76 → 2058.94] You see that scary stuff where China is now state subsidizing news agencies in other countries?
[2058.94 → 2065.82] Like creating their own Chinese-backed news agency that just operates like any other news agency,
[2065.88 → 2068.96] except they don't have to worry about making money because they're just backed by the Chinese government.
[2072.18 → 2072.92] It's interesting.
[2073.10 → 2077.14] Isn't RUTH that but Russian?
[2077.56 → 2078.46] Well, it's different.
[2078.56 → 2079.54] I don't know anything about it really.
[2079.54 → 2083.42] State-sponsored media within a country is a thing in a lot of places.
[2083.72 → 2085.16] You've got your RUTH.
[2085.32 → 2088.48] You've got your Chinese state media, your North Korean state media, your Fox News.
[2088.90 → 2090.20] You've got your whatever.
[2090.80 → 2091.40] Just kidding.
[2091.68 → 2093.76] I know Fox News is technically independent.
[2093.76 → 2098.84] But this is different.
[2099.04 → 2107.36] This is China actually building news companies, like news agencies on other countries' soil
[2107.36 → 2111.70] and just like making sure that they don't run out of money effectively.
[2112.48 → 2112.74] Interesting.
[2112.78 → 2116.38] So it's going to be a fascinating way for them to control the narrative.
[2118.60 → 2121.52] Anyway, what else we got?
[2121.52 → 2122.24] One quick thing.
[2122.24 → 2122.70] Oh, yeah, sure.
[2122.70 → 2123.68] Let's jump back to the shirt.
[2123.76 → 2126.90] Oh, yeah, right.
[2127.00 → 2127.74] Okay, Luke's green.
[2127.86 → 2128.24] Here we go.
[2129.40 → 2130.32] These are the results.
[2131.40 → 2133.24] So that's a solid five.
[2133.44 → 2140.24] When you got five, four, six, and seven in the top four results, basically nobody really likes it.
[2142.36 → 2146.30] So you've got the charitable 6% that are giving it a 10.
[2146.54 → 2153.30] You've got the more honest, you know, 50 votes that gave it a 9.
[2153.76 → 2155.90] And then most people are just like, eh.
[2157.40 → 2157.92] Yeah.
[2159.12 → 2159.80] All right.
[2159.90 → 2160.22] Cool.
[2160.22 → 2166.78] Actually, speaking of making sure that things stay funded.
[2166.78 → 2168.94] At least more people voted 10 than one.
[2169.64 → 2171.20] Yeah, I guess that's something.
[2171.70 → 2171.88] Hey.
[2171.88 → 2172.36] Yeah.
[2172.36 → 2172.96] Yeah.
[2172.96 → 2176.48] Speaking of staying funded, this show is brought to you by Squarespace.
[2177.26 → 2178.02] We use Squarespace.
[2178.34 → 2178.76] No joke.
[2178.88 → 2179.56] We do use it.
[2179.56 → 2182.18] LTXExpo.com and LinusMediaGroup.com.
[2182.24 → 2184.98] Ooh, LTXExpo.com has some updates and stuff.
[2185.14 → 2185.34] Really?
[2185.44 → 2186.10] That are coming.
[2186.52 → 2186.72] Coming.
[2187.18 → 2188.20] Oh, wow.
[2188.20 → 2189.96] I think we announced dates.
[2190.50 → 2190.70] Oh.
[2191.66 → 2195.20] There's a complete redesign that I just had a look at, and I don't know if it's up yet.
[2195.66 → 2195.98] Oh, yeah.
[2196.10 → 2196.74] I think it is up.
[2196.80 → 2197.14] Look at that.
[2197.20 → 2198.04] Tempo's up.
[2198.48 → 2204.80] So, LTXExpo.com and LinusMediaGroup.com are both built using Squarespace.
[2205.50 → 2210.08] Squarespace is a simple way to get an online presence up and running quickly.
[2210.20 → 2215.48] They've got tons of great-looking templates, and they've got...
[2215.48 → 2215.92] Sorry.
[2216.44 → 2217.24] Wife just showed up.
[2217.34 → 2217.52] Wow.
[2217.60 → 2218.76] We started WAN Show so late.
[2218.82 → 2219.58] How long do we have?
[2220.00 → 2221.26] We're supposed to leave right now.
[2221.42 → 2222.16] We're supposed to leave now.
[2222.26 → 2222.46] Cool.
[2222.46 → 2225.06] And also, I don't know if you've noticed, but the power's flickering.
[2225.16 → 2226.62] I did notice the power was flickering.
[2226.62 → 2227.46] The UPS is...
[2227.46 → 2229.22] So, we might not last much longer anyway.
[2229.48 → 2230.04] So, quickly.
[2230.48 → 2230.80] Squarespace.
[2231.08 → 2234.60] If you need help, Squarespace offers webinars, a full series of help guides, or you can contact
[2234.60 → 2238.84] their 24-7 support via live chat and email to help you build your site.
[2239.14 → 2243.78] Go to squarespace.com forward slash WAN and use offer code WAN to save 10%.
[2243.78 → 2246.04] The show is also brought to you by Displate.
[2246.44 → 2250.52] Displate is the magnet-mounted metal poster provider.
[2250.92 → 2255.88] No more mounting tools are required, and you don't need to put any holes in your wall to
[2255.88 → 2256.50] mount a Displate.
[2256.50 → 2258.36] It attaches to your wall with magnets.
[2258.76 → 2259.96] They've got over six...
[2259.96 → 2260.30] Oh, wow.
[2260.36 → 2261.60] They've updated these talking points.
[2261.94 → 2268.38] Over 600,000 designs from 30,000 artists, and they're available in different sizes.
[2268.80 → 2273.94] They plant a tree for every Displate you purchase, and so far, they've planted 11 million trees,
[2274.06 → 2276.18] which I guess means they've sold a lot of frigging Displaces.
[2276.40 → 2276.54] Yeah.
[2276.54 → 2279.72] Here at Linus Tech Tips, we have our own prints.
[2279.98 → 2282.58] So I'm just going to pull up one of those for you all here.
[2284.78 → 2285.70] Where's our portraits?
[2285.84 → 2286.60] There they are.
[2286.96 → 2289.04] They look freaking sick, in my opinion.
[2289.12 → 2290.32] I think James's is the best.
[2291.40 → 2292.50] That one is pretty amazing.
[2292.50 → 2292.78] It's a duck.
[2292.96 → 2293.50] I love it.
[2294.24 → 2294.90] It doesn't matter.
[2295.56 → 2296.30] You know, it's a duck.
[2296.38 → 2296.62] Whatever.
[2296.70 → 2297.08] Who cares?
[2298.58 → 2303.98] And you guys can check them out at leg.GG slash Displate and use offer code LTT to save
[2303.98 → 2305.14] 15%.
[2305.14 → 2307.10] At least that's in the lower third.
[2307.22 → 2310.80] I don't actually see it in my talking points anymore, so I guess we'll find out soon enough,
[2310.80 → 2311.20] won't we?
[2311.20 → 2315.70] The View Sonic XG270QG is our next sponsor of the video.
[2315.80 → 2317.18] Well, View Sonic, featuring this monitor.
[2317.66 → 2319.80] It's a 27-inch display, 1440.
[2319.90 → 2323.42] It's overclockable to 165 hertz, and this is really cool.
[2323.50 → 2327.50] It uses LG's low response time IPS panel.
[2327.62 → 2331.80] So this is that one millisecond response time panel that we liked so much when we originally
[2331.80 → 2333.86] looked at it, and it still looks great today.
[2334.22 → 2338.82] It's height adjustable with tilt, pivot, and swivel, and we've got an upcoming Linus Tech
[2338.82 → 2340.86] Tips video this Sunday showing off this monitor.
[2340.86 → 2341.46] Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2341.50 → 2341.78] We do.
[2342.24 → 2347.38] And we do this sick custom water-cooled build in a singularity case.
[2347.50 → 2348.40] It's actually really nice.
[2348.68 → 2352.84] Check it out today at the link in the video or podcast description.
[2354.02 → 2355.56] Are you done, sponsors, now?
[2355.68 → 2356.06] Yes.
[2356.18 → 2360.14] Just before we move on, one of the reasons I wanted to bring up the keyboard thing is
[2360.14 → 2365.38] because in diagnosing my keyboard, I was taking it apart, and I was trying to look up the
[2365.38 → 2369.96] brand of lube that I recommended way back in the day for lubing your switches.
[2369.96 → 2374.04] So I looked up my old keycap replacement guide, and in looking that up, I figured out that
[2374.04 → 2376.14] you guys did a watch your keyboard on the dishwasher video.
[2376.22 → 2376.60] We did.
[2376.76 → 2377.90] You missed a couple of things.
[2379.30 → 2380.16] What did we miss?
[2380.42 → 2380.96] The lube.
[2382.08 → 2382.76] Missed the lube.
[2382.84 → 2384.08] If you wash your keyboard on the dishwasher.
[2384.52 → 2385.48] Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[2385.48 → 2388.64] Actually, there was more left on it than you'd think.
[2388.92 → 2389.26] Oh, okay.
[2389.40 → 2389.60] Yeah.
[2389.70 → 2390.70] We did check for that.
[2390.82 → 2392.16] We should have mentioned it, though.
[2392.34 → 2393.72] We should have specifically called it out.
[2394.22 → 2394.74] What else did we get wrong?
[2394.74 → 2395.66] There is also...
[2395.66 → 2396.88] Oh, because we didn't run it hot.
[2397.72 → 2400.76] If we had run it hot, for sure, the lube would have melted.
[2401.00 → 2404.86] Do you have, like, heat determining things on your dishwasher?
[2404.98 → 2405.10] Yeah.
[2405.28 → 2406.38] Does everyone have that?
[2406.42 → 2406.78] I don't know.
[2407.16 → 2407.88] I don't think so.
[2408.00 → 2409.82] I specifically mentioned it in the video, though.
[2409.82 → 2410.06] Oh, okay.
[2410.06 → 2410.90] That I ran it on cold.
[2411.02 → 2411.30] Okay.
[2411.38 → 2412.72] Or at least I did in the footage.
[2412.82 → 2413.76] I don't know if I made it into the video.
[2413.76 → 2416.52] I don't remember that, but I didn't, like, I wasn't fine-tooth combing.
[2416.60 → 2416.84] All right.
[2417.40 → 2420.42] And then, I mean, there are a few things.
[2420.92 → 2424.28] Like, you probably didn't have distilled water going through your dishwasher.
[2424.38 → 2425.06] No, I didn't.
[2425.38 → 2425.56] Yeah.
[2425.66 → 2426.42] That would be better.
[2427.32 → 2428.22] They all survived.
[2428.30 → 2428.74] They did.
[2430.32 → 2432.58] And I appreciate that you did more than one.
[2432.78 → 2433.38] I will say...
[2433.38 → 2433.94] That was...
[2433.94 → 2434.60] You did a bunch.
[2434.66 → 2435.46] That was cool.
[2435.58 → 2436.42] I do appreciate that.
[2436.42 → 2438.96] But you could still get minerals from the water.
[2439.26 → 2440.00] Absolutely, you could.
[2440.28 → 2440.30] Yeah.
[2441.04 → 2441.94] And then, even...
[2441.94 → 2445.52] I know PBT does have a very low melting point, and I'm happy you pointed that out, because
[2445.52 → 2446.54] no one should do that.
[2446.76 → 2449.42] But even ABS plastics can warp.
[2450.44 → 2451.02] That's true.
[2451.10 → 2452.44] We didn't have any war page, though.
[2452.66 → 2453.22] I...
[2453.22 → 2454.08] Yeah.
[2454.18 → 2456.16] We also specifically ran it on cold.
[2456.40 → 2456.56] Yeah.
[2456.56 → 2457.28] For that reason.
[2457.50 → 2457.66] Yeah.
[2457.88 → 2458.80] So, I don't know.
[2459.40 → 2461.46] But the lube was the main one I wanted to put.
[2461.46 → 2461.80] Okay.
[2461.94 → 2462.24] Yes.
[2462.34 → 2463.82] We should have called that out.
[2463.82 → 2469.62] We were lucky, though, in that our configuration and our test run, we didn't have any problems.
[2469.82 → 2470.14] There is...
[2470.14 → 2472.04] I do know of plenty of people that have done it.
[2472.10 → 2472.76] It's been fine.
[2472.92 → 2473.14] Right.
[2473.26 → 2476.50] But there are just some, like, you should know of these risks before going into...
[2476.50 → 2478.18] I've never heard of anyone actually killing one.
[2479.18 → 2481.44] I've seen warped plastics.
[2481.92 → 2482.76] That would be bad.
[2482.76 → 2486.86] But I've never actually heard of anyone say their keyboard straight up died from it.
[2487.22 → 2488.14] So, yeah.
[2488.46 → 2489.06] All right.
[2489.24 → 2491.98] There are just a couple more things that we have to chat about.
[2492.14 → 2492.86] LTX 2020.
[2493.18 → 2493.74] Save the date.
[2493.90 → 2495.40] August 7th and 8th.
[2496.00 → 2497.38] Oh, the new site is live.
[2497.46 → 2497.60] Okay.
[2497.68 → 2499.10] Well, we ended up talking about that anyway.
[2499.34 → 2501.32] But at any rate, there it is.
[2501.40 → 2501.82] I'm excited.
[2501.82 → 2502.20] LTX 2020.
[2502.42 → 2503.18] August 8th and 9th.
[2503.22 → 2504.14] Vancouver Convention Centre.
[2504.14 → 2506.68] We're going to be in the big newer side this year.
[2506.74 → 2507.48] 7th and 8th.
[2507.50 → 2508.56] And then you said 8th and 9th.
[2508.64 → 2509.04] Oh, wait.
[2509.12 → 2509.96] It's 8th and 9th.
[2510.10 → 2510.58] 8th and 9th.
[2510.58 → 2511.22] Oh, crap.
[2511.36 → 2512.34] 8th and 9th.
[2512.46 → 2514.10] 8th and 9th.
[2514.30 → 2516.14] In the doc, it says 7th and 8th.
[2516.58 → 2516.76] Oh.
[2517.20 → 2517.36] Yeah.
[2517.66 → 2519.78] LTX, August 8th and 9th.
[2519.84 → 2520.12] Yep.
[2521.14 → 2523.06] Featuring Dream Hack once again.
[2523.26 → 2524.18] Super excited.
[2524.38 → 2525.18] It's going to be awesome.
[2525.32 → 2528.72] We've got a bunch of information on the site that's been updated except for that.
[2529.80 → 2531.26] Transportation might have information.
[2531.42 → 2531.78] Yay.
[2532.26 → 2532.92] There you go.
[2533.06 → 2534.06] There's good stuff there.
[2534.18 → 2534.52] So, yep.
[2534.72 → 2534.92] Yeah.
[2535.26 → 2536.78] Guys, want to see you there.
[2536.90 → 2539.82] We had a great, great show last year.
[2539.82 → 2540.38] It's genuinely.
[2541.80 → 2545.44] We've got some amazing booth ideas for this coming year.
[2545.50 → 2546.96] Vaughn, do you remember any of the new ones?
[2548.02 → 2549.84] Can I just, like, tease a couple of them?
[2551.06 → 2552.96] What was that stage challenge?
[2554.28 → 2555.00] Oh, okay.
[2555.08 → 2560.24] So, this one, I had suggested that we have two PCs where there's something wrong with each of them.
[2560.24 → 2560.56] Yes.
[2560.72 → 2561.10] Yes.
[2561.54 → 2561.94] Yes.
[2562.10 → 2562.88] To figure out what the problem is.
[2562.88 → 2566.02] So, an onstage PC diagnosis face-off.
[2566.02 → 2566.94] Is it the same issue?
[2567.08 → 2567.74] It's the same issue?
[2568.00 → 2568.18] Yeah.
[2568.56 → 2570.22] The idea is the first to post.
[2570.38 → 2570.60] Yeah.
[2570.94 → 2571.48] First to post.
[2571.52 → 2572.32] That's pretty cool.
[2572.52 → 2574.42] So, that's going to be really fun.
[2574.78 → 2577.48] Got a lot of really greats, like, panel ideas.
[2577.48 → 2580.20] We're going to be inviting a whack ton of creators.
[2581.68 → 2584.48] If you guys haven't heard from me yet, it's because I haven't sent emails yet.
[2584.72 → 2585.10] Don't worry.
[2585.24 → 2586.10] I will send out emails.
[2586.42 → 2590.54] I was very excited last year, and I was, like, pretty sure I was going to enjoy it more than Pax.
[2590.62 → 2592.26] And then I did buy massive amounts.
[2592.58 → 2594.10] And that makes me way more excited about this year.
[2594.42 → 2595.10] Please come say hi.
[2595.18 → 2596.66] This year is going to be freaking awesome.
[2596.76 → 2597.56] I'm super stoked.
[2597.76 → 2598.10] All right.
[2598.10 → 2601.58] And then I also got a pimp, Carpool Critics.
[2601.68 → 2606.08] So, we are experimenting with a podcast.
[2606.90 → 2607.74] Purely podcast.
[2608.08 → 2609.46] It's called Carpool Critics.
[2609.58 → 2610.56] You can find it at...
[2610.56 → 2611.40] Which, by the way...
[2611.40 → 2611.74] Yes.
[2611.88 → 2617.08] The float plane traffic, when you launch a video that says we're leaving float plane, is crazy.
[2617.48 → 2617.82] We did?
[2618.04 → 2618.30] Yeah.
[2619.02 → 2625.04] The Carpool Critics, we're going to be going to podcast only thing, was titled, We're Leaving Float Plane.
[2625.04 → 2629.38] So, everyone got a notification, Linus Tech Tips, we're leaving float plane.
[2629.62 → 2631.04] That was awesome.
[2633.22 → 2636.52] The traffic spike was huge.
[2636.78 → 2637.54] Okay, then.
[2638.00 → 2640.98] It was a little misleading, but, you know.
[2641.02 → 2643.72] I think he's facepalming because that was not supposed to happen.
[2643.94 → 2646.04] I don't know if he cleared that, but I didn't clear that.
[2646.14 → 2647.66] Yeah, I didn't clear that.
[2647.70 → 2648.04] And that has...
[2648.68 → 2648.80] Okay.
[2649.42 → 2649.66] Yeah.
[2650.22 → 2653.36] There are a few people in the comments being like, wow, really clickbaity.
[2653.36 → 2655.64] But, you know, it was cool for us to see.
[2655.80 → 2658.44] Yeah, also, I don't see why they shouldn't just keep uploading it there anyway.
[2659.12 → 2659.34] Yeah.
[2659.54 → 2660.50] So, okay.
[2660.90 → 2663.88] We're also going to be releasing audio-only posts, guys, but...
[2663.88 → 2665.26] Yeah, well, okay.
[2665.32 → 2666.76] When are you guys going to be done that feature?
[2666.90 → 2667.48] I don't know.
[2667.52 → 2667.80] Okay.
[2668.00 → 2668.32] Well...
[2668.32 → 2671.96] Okay, so it's on Twitter, at Carpool Critics.
[2672.24 → 2677.12] You can head to carpoolcritics.libson.com to get all the meets about it.
[2677.12 → 2682.78] And basically, it's Riley, James, and David are kind of the core cast, but I would expect
[2682.78 → 2685.10] them to rotate in and out and have some other people in there.
[2685.60 → 2690.78] They're going to be talking about old movies, new movies, just kind of movie-related stuff.
[2691.70 → 2696.66] It's available on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Spotify, and more.
[2697.80 → 2698.32] And...
[2698.32 → 2702.42] I was going to say, I know you have negative time, but I was hoping you were going to be
[2702.42 → 2704.08] on the Rise of Skywalker one.
[2704.08 → 2706.80] I honestly, I think...
[2706.80 → 2711.40] So, we went and saw it together, and then we ended up sitting in his car in the parking
[2711.40 → 2711.74] lot.
[2712.06 → 2713.24] I said five minutes.
[2713.36 → 2718.54] We ended up talking for about an hour, just because we both had so much to unpack.
[2718.80 → 2719.66] Very many thoughts.
[2721.48 → 2725.38] I'm just spamming chat with Carpool Critics links here.
[2725.42 → 2725.56] Oh, cool.
[2726.42 → 2727.02] I'll get the other ones.
[2727.02 → 2730.66] I haven't actually watched the Carpool Critics episode on Rise of Skywalker yet.
[2730.66 → 2732.66] I just don't know how much I can...
[2732.66 → 2734.66] Yeah, I don't know.
[2734.82 → 2736.84] They had already recorded it by the time I saw the movie.
[2737.08 → 2737.42] Oh, okay.
[2737.42 → 2739.08] Because they went and saw it on release day.
[2739.30 → 2739.54] Release day.
[2739.74 → 2740.28] That makes sense.
[2740.42 → 2744.78] And honestly, I doubt that I would have had much to contribute, because they seem to have
[2744.78 → 2746.14] all had pretty much the same...
[2746.14 → 2747.90] They seem to have all seen the same movie that I did.
[2748.38 → 2749.84] Now, okay, we're...
[2749.84 → 2750.36] Oh, man.
[2750.44 → 2752.40] Do I have time to go off on a short Star Wars tangent?
[2754.60 → 2755.66] Is the building locked?
[2755.76 → 2757.54] Like, can you lock the building while I...
[2757.54 → 2757.76] Okay.
[2758.06 → 2758.58] All right.
[2758.58 → 2764.52] So, I took a lot of flack, because I ranted at the end of Tech Linked about some of my
[2764.52 → 2767.86] issues with Rise of Skywalker, with one of the big ones being...
[2767.86 → 2768.44] Spoiler alert!
[2771.50 → 2774.06] It's still not really a spoiler, but it's a small spoiler.
[2774.30 → 2774.46] Okay.
[2774.46 → 2774.52] All right.
[2774.64 → 2776.48] So, one of my main issues with...
[2776.48 → 2777.92] Oh, it's hard to say main issue.
[2777.98 → 2781.46] One of my main issues with Rise of Skywalker being this...
[2782.10 → 2783.46] Just pulling new Force abilities...
[2784.00 → 2784.22] Yeah.
[2784.46 → 2784.90] Oh, yeah.
[2785.06 → 2789.80] Out of, you know, a drawer or your butt or a pocket whenever you need one in order to
[2789.80 → 2790.52] solve a problem.
[2791.48 → 2798.40] And I took a lot of flack for people saying, well, actually, if you read the comics and
[2798.40 → 2799.42] watched all the shows...
[2799.42 → 2799.68] No, no.
[2799.76 → 2799.90] No.
[2799.90 → 2800.16] Hold on.
[2800.20 → 2800.44] Hold on.
[2800.80 → 2803.78] If you read all the comics and watched all the shows, you would know that there are
[2803.78 → 2809.24] established times, like Force Healing was established here and Force This was established there and
[2809.24 → 2810.42] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2810.78 → 2814.16] So, my problem with all of that is that...
[2814.16 → 2814.60] Oh, right.
[2814.72 → 2823.48] And one of the most, like, QED MF posts was, well, it's always been that way.
[2824.22 → 2827.72] In A New Hope, moving things around with the Force doesn't exist.
[2827.72 → 2832.90] It's only this ability to be superhumanly reactive.
[2833.18 → 2837.40] So, better reflexes and to know what's going to happen before it's going to happen.
[2837.94 → 2840.84] We can communicate over long distances and with the dead.
[2842.68 → 2844.26] It guides us.
[2844.44 → 2845.90] It's a mystic thing.
[2845.90 → 2847.52] It binds the galaxy together.
[2847.52 → 2848.92] And that was really about it.
[2849.40 → 2855.04] And then, early in Empire, so this was their, like, um, actually, you know, when Luke grabs
[2855.04 → 2858.62] his lightsabre with the Force, that's pulling Force abilities out of his butt.
[2858.84 → 2862.16] And then there's Return of the Jedi when there's Force lightning out of the butt.
[2862.30 → 2866.40] And then you've got, you know, the prequel trilogy where they pull lots of Force things
[2866.40 → 2866.94] out of their butt.
[2866.94 → 2868.34] Okay, here's my response to that.
[2868.64 → 2870.18] All of that made sense.
[2870.86 → 2878.58] Because, in A New Hope, Obi-Wan really, he's like an old man and, like, you look at him
[2878.58 → 2879.46] trying to fight Vader.
[2879.62 → 2882.38] Like, he's barely even standing at this point.
[2882.54 → 2882.78] Okay?
[2883.36 → 2887.28] So, the fact that he doesn't still, you know, do double flips or whatever, you could bind
[2887.28 → 2888.22] of make an argument there.
[2888.72 → 2890.92] Luke is still learning how to use it.
[2891.10 → 2891.88] He's a novice.
[2891.88 → 2896.98] You can introduce new Force abilities with Luke Skywalker throughout the original trilogy
[2896.98 → 2903.96] without it being a continuity error or breaking the rules of the galaxy that they've, you
[2903.96 → 2905.16] know, laid out at all.
[2905.36 → 2910.62] As for the prequel trilogy, except just phenomenally stupid things like R2-D2
[2910.62 → 2915.90] suddenly having a jetpack, like, when it comes to Force abilities, well, yeah.
[2916.24 → 2920.18] You've got literal, like, gigantic schools dedicated to studying the Force.
[2920.18 → 2922.92] All of that knowledge was, like, lost and stuff.
[2923.34 → 2927.64] Of course, they could do stuff that didn't exist any more later.
[2927.96 → 2929.94] I had a bigger issue, and we talked about this.
[2930.12 → 2931.32] I had a bigger issue with magnitude.
[2932.48 → 2932.74] Okay.
[2933.10 → 2933.54] Okay.
[2933.70 → 2935.30] We can, yeah, sure.
[2935.40 → 2935.82] That, too.
[2936.22 → 2938.58] So, it ties into magnitude, though.
[2939.08 → 2939.34] Yeah.
[2939.46 → 2940.06] No, I hear you.
[2940.18 → 2940.98] So, here we are.
[2941.26 → 2945.82] We're in the future when all that knowledge was, like, lost and stuff, and all those users
[2945.82 → 2953.12] were lost, and then there was this period where, no, the entire Force did not concentrate itself
[2953.12 → 2954.00] into one individual.
[2954.52 → 2954.80] Okay.
[2954.96 → 2955.84] So, that didn't happen.
[2956.26 → 2963.30] And then we're, like, 20, 30 years in the future, and we're still pulling new abilities
[2963.30 → 2969.28] out of our butt, even though all those many, many, for thousands of years, the Jedi Knights
[2969.28 → 2971.02] were the guardians of peace and justice.
[2972.00 → 2973.88] Thousands of years.
[2974.44 → 2975.54] We lost all that.
[2975.70 → 2980.78] But now, within a couple of decades, we've got, you know, Jedi Masters suddenly being,
[2980.94 → 2981.58] like, oh, yeah, sure.
[2981.66 → 2985.40] Like, I'm a Jedi Master or whatever, even though I, like, didn't finish my Jedi Knight training,
[2985.40 → 2989.40] so however that works, and, like, I just...
[2989.40 → 2997.54] It drove me nuts, because even if you've got these comic books, and you've got these
[2997.54 → 3002.24] shows that have established this stuff, you haven't established how Rey ended up being
[3002.24 → 3002.88] able to do it.
[3002.98 → 3006.00] The only reason why I'm not chipping in more is because I know we can't stay here forever.
[3006.16 → 3006.40] Yeah.
[3008.60 → 3010.44] I was just explaining for people watching.
[3012.64 → 3013.34] I don't know.
[3013.34 → 3014.34] It just...
[3014.34 → 3019.78] It drives me crazy, because it takes all the stakes out of a conflict or out of a problem.
[3020.32 → 3023.82] When you know that just, I don't know, like, Shirt of the Forest or something.
[3024.40 → 3029.26] I watched a video recently on it, and I thought his explanation was pretty solid.
[3029.50 → 3034.56] It was actually a video about the Clone Wars animated series, because they're releasing a
[3034.56 → 3035.18] new season soon.
[3035.34 → 3036.30] I'm really excited about that.
[3036.72 → 3043.30] And they went off and said, like, okay, so the original series is the foundation of
[3043.30 → 3043.80] your house.
[3044.46 → 3044.70] Right.
[3044.80 → 3049.66] The prequels, it's kind of like the door and some of the siding, some of the stuff
[3049.66 → 3050.16] on the outside.
[3051.26 → 3055.98] The Clone Wars animated series is like the structural beams inside the house.
[3055.98 → 3062.18] And then Disney's series is like the live, you laugh, you love sign on the wall.
[3064.34 → 3064.78] Okay.
[3065.26 → 3066.90] And I just thought that was great.
[3068.50 → 3070.28] I just really liked that analogy.
[3070.86 → 3071.54] It was perfect.
[3071.64 → 3072.68] Like, it's pretty.
[3074.36 → 3075.74] It's a nice...
[3075.74 → 3076.42] It looks...
[3076.42 → 3077.56] The calligraphy is perfect.
[3077.70 → 3078.02] Yeah.
[3078.02 → 3079.16] I don't know.
[3079.28 → 3081.04] I mean, I don't think that...
[3081.04 → 3083.20] I don't think that they could have...
[3083.20 → 3084.72] I don't know how I would have fixed it.
[3086.64 → 3087.74] That's the bottom line.
[3087.76 → 3089.94] By the time you're on that one, you're just kind of screwed.
[3090.10 → 3091.18] And this is something we...
[3091.18 → 3092.34] This is something we talked about.
[3092.34 → 3095.24] Like, the pacing of the movie was terrible because they were trying to...
[3095.24 → 3101.88] They were trying to tie up two entire random series of events worth of movies.
[3102.44 → 3104.34] Random events and random characters.
[3105.96 → 3108.56] Utterly meaningless events and meaningless characters.
[3108.98 → 3111.94] And they're just like trying to tie it all up in like one movie.
[3112.04 → 3114.16] And then also stuff has to happen in that movie.
[3114.34 → 3115.72] And like...
[3115.72 → 3117.62] Kylo Ren is a terrible villain.
[3117.62 → 3122.76] His arc is just terrible and boring.
[3125.52 → 3126.70] I mean, you know what?
[3127.08 → 3128.40] I had a disagreement with...
[3128.40 → 3130.42] I think it was either David or Riley about...
[3130.42 → 3131.04] Spoiler alert!
[3132.92 → 3134.82] About bringing back Emperor Palpatine.
[3134.94 → 3136.72] They were like, that was the worst thing they did in the movie.
[3136.94 → 3137.46] Palpatine, okay.
[3137.84 → 3138.44] Palpatine, whatever.
[3138.54 → 3138.80] I don't care.
[3140.88 → 3142.92] So they said that was the worst thing they did in the movie.
[3142.98 → 3146.34] And I said, I think it was one of the smartest things they did in the movie.
[3146.34 → 3149.92] Because they had no villain with any gravity whatsoever.
[3150.46 → 3151.42] Who is it going to be?
[3152.10 → 3152.72] No one.
[3152.72 → 3153.02] It's not Ren.
[3153.20 → 3154.00] It's not Spoke.
[3154.48 → 3155.26] Yeah, he's gone.
[3156.48 → 3160.04] So what could they possibly do?
[3160.28 → 3161.40] And there's been interviews.
[3162.40 → 3164.34] Like George Lucas apparently told...
[3165.32 → 3166.34] Ian McDermid?
[3167.34 → 3168.16] I can't remember.
[3168.46 → 3169.50] I don't know how to pronounce his name.
[3169.56 → 3169.76] Whatever.
[3169.88 → 3173.92] He told the actor that plays Emperor Palpatine that he was dead.
[3173.92 → 3177.42] When he got thrown down the shaft in Return of the Jedi.
[3177.72 → 3180.76] And so he was like, oh, I was surprised to be alive again and stuff.
[3180.88 → 3182.58] But what else could they possibly do?
[3183.32 → 3183.54] Yeah.
[3184.38 → 3184.78] Yeah.
[3185.68 → 3186.36] I...
[3186.36 → 3188.10] It was a mess.
[3188.26 → 3189.92] I think bringing Palpatine back was fine.
[3190.20 → 3192.36] I didn't have very many issues with that part of it.
[3192.56 → 3195.08] Him being back in general wasn't a huge issue for me.
[3195.46 → 3195.92] His like...
[3197.16 → 3197.94] God lightning.
[3197.94 → 3198.34] Yeah.
[3199.14 → 3202.30] So I'm not well enough to walk on my own.
[3202.46 → 3202.94] But...
[3203.60 → 3206.02] Like one minute later.
[3206.36 → 3206.78] You know?
[3207.12 → 3208.04] No problem.
[3208.40 → 3211.36] I hated how important lightsabres were.
[3212.00 → 3212.28] Yep.
[3214.32 → 3215.98] Lightsabres should be super cool.
[3216.58 → 3217.94] But they should be a...
[3218.54 → 3218.90] They don't...
[3218.90 → 3219.90] A conduit.
[3219.90 → 3220.22] Yeah.
[3220.28 → 3221.50] They don't have power.
[3221.98 → 3223.16] They're just a laser sword.
[3223.24 → 3224.48] Han Solo can wield one.
[3224.48 → 3226.04] They're...
[3226.04 → 3226.54] They're...
[3226.54 → 3227.68] Like...
[3227.68 → 3228.84] What?
[3229.22 → 3235.18] It would have made more sense to me if Rey had just like gotten force lightning zapped
[3235.18 → 3237.52] and then just like blasted it back at him or something.
[3237.60 → 3241.22] That would have made more sense than like...
[3241.22 → 3245.26] No, one lightsabre is not enough to stop a force lightning attack, but two?
[3245.48 → 3249.26] Not to mention that it's from some guy that just disabled the entire sky.
[3249.92 → 3251.62] Like, what are you talking about?
[3252.38 → 3252.66] Like...
[3252.66 → 3253.66] Like...
[3253.66 → 3254.22] Yeah, it's like...
[3254.22 → 3255.28] Mace Windu blocks it.
[3255.40 → 3256.76] Like, if you're a 10-year-old...
[3256.76 → 3257.12] But there's...
[3257.12 → 3260.10] It's like, yeah, that was like super badass when Rey was like...
[3260.10 → 3263.60] But that's it.
[3263.72 → 3266.50] It's like it was written by a 10-year-old for a 10-year-old.
[3266.56 → 3266.98] It's like...
[3266.98 → 3269.14] It's like they had kids in the schoolyard.
[3269.22 → 3271.78] Like, remember what it was like when you're in elementary school?
[3271.96 → 3275.14] And you're like, oh, man, like, wouldn't it be cool if like...
[3275.14 → 3277.78] You had like a jet plane, but it is like...
[3277.78 → 3278.70] Was like so big...
[3278.70 → 3279.30] Also a dinosaur.
[3279.30 → 3285.96] And then it is like hit the school, and it like blew up like the whole block, but no one was there, and we just didn't have to go to school for a week.
[3287.02 → 3292.56] That's how much sense the action sequences in Star Wars Rise of Skywalker make.
[3292.56 → 3295.46] And I think there's like...
[3295.46 → 3303.28] Okay, yeah, so Mace Windu blocks Force Lightning with his lightsabre, but you can tell it's taking an extreme amount of force to hold it back.
[3303.50 → 3309.84] And I think there might be a little bit of like Palpatine was letting him because he wanted Anakin to have the moment.
[3310.70 → 3310.90] Yeah.
[3311.00 → 3312.24] Because that was an extremely important moment.
[3312.50 → 3319.30] Mace Windu even sees the shatter point of that moment, but he thinks it's him taking down Palpatine.
[3319.30 → 3323.54] He doesn't think it's Anakin interrupting because he doesn't know why the shatter point's there.
[3323.66 → 3325.40] Anyway, yeah, no one cares.
[3325.68 → 3326.06] All right.
[3326.40 → 3328.58] I think that's pretty much all I have to talk about.
[3328.74 → 3331.40] The Segway chair is...
[3331.40 → 3332.38] It looks terrible.
[3332.52 → 3334.10] I mean, Segway's not even Segway.
[3334.12 → 3335.48] Why isn't it just a wheelchair?
[3335.72 → 3337.06] They got bought by like whoever.
[3338.06 → 3340.94] So here there are a bunch of questions and I don't know.
[3341.28 → 3342.80] Why don't you just put a wheel on the front?
[3342.86 → 3344.98] They put wheels on the back just in case it rocks backwards.
[3345.20 → 3345.62] Like what?
[3346.44 → 3347.60] I don't know, dude.
[3347.60 → 3353.28] So yeah, it's a self-balancing egg-shaped two-wheeler so you can cruise around it.
[3353.54 → 3355.54] It goes almost 40 kilometres an hour.
[3356.74 → 3357.22] Okay.
[3358.50 → 3361.98] Instead of being driven by leaning, it uses a joystick on the right-hand side of the seat.
[3362.06 → 3364.32] So you're basically like Professor Xavier, I guess.
[3365.04 → 3366.64] But you don't actually hover.
[3368.24 → 3371.08] The self-balancing technology will always keep the chair level.
[3371.24 → 3374.10] The two-wheel setup will allow for quick changes in direction even while stopped.
[3374.10 → 3379.68] And there are three more small wheels visible on the underside of the chair for presumably moving it around while the motors aren't on.
[3379.82 → 3382.78] It was apparently inspired by the gyrosphere from Jurassic Park.
[3382.98 → 3385.02] And it's for sale to the public in 2021.
[3385.24 → 3385.98] No word on cost.
[3386.04 → 3386.88] Where would you park it?
[3387.60 → 3388.98] Like where would you...
[3388.98 → 3389.78] How would you...
[3389.78 → 3391.20] Yeah.
[3391.70 → 3392.60] So, okay.
[3393.48 → 3396.12] Segway was acquired by rival Nine bot in 2015.
[3396.56 → 3398.10] Yeah, that's who acquired them.
[3398.14 → 3401.86] They had previously actually tried to get Nine bot's knock offs banned from the U.S.
[3402.08 → 3404.14] So that was apparently the solution to that.
[3404.82 → 3406.66] Yay for, you know...
[3406.66 → 3411.54] Someone in the chat said Rey had the power of every Jedi insider.
[3411.68 → 3412.14] So did Luke.
[3414.12 → 3414.56] So.
[3415.10 → 3417.56] Yeah, and also that's just stupid and makes no sense.
[3417.90 → 3421.46] Someone also said that Mace Window used the power of the dark side.
[3421.54 → 3423.02] Yeah, VAP had whatever.
[3424.36 → 3425.20] That's not the point.
[3425.86 → 3426.54] I hear you though.
[3427.66 → 3428.44] It's cool.
[3429.40 → 3430.52] Made his character very cool.
[3430.52 → 3432.06] All right.
[3432.26 → 3432.84] Mr. Min.
[3433.18 → 3434.68] It's the first time I can watch the live stream.
[3434.80 → 3435.42] Thanks for watching.
[3435.60 → 3436.04] Sorry guys.
[3436.08 → 3438.82] I can only do the top ones this week because I really need to go.
[3439.26 → 3442.50] Steve says, I'm a maintenance planner learning to do coding for creating algorithms for AI
[3442.50 → 3446.76] to auto schedule maintenance for a 1 million square foot manufacturing facility.
[3446.98 → 3448.72] Basically planning myself out of a job.
[3448.86 → 3449.56] Any openings?
[3452.14 → 3456.24] I don't know what we would do with your skill set, but that sounds sweet.
[3458.86 → 3460.38] Chris says, got my valve index.
[3460.38 → 3461.90] Thanks to your recommendation a few weeks ago.
[3461.98 → 3462.84] Super happy with it.
[3462.88 → 3463.98] As always, your videos are great.
[3464.90 → 3466.62] Video thought projects with Raspberry Pi.
[3466.76 → 3470.32] I mean, the thing about Raspberry Pi is it's like what video project isn't a Raspberry Pi
[3470.32 → 3470.68] project.
[3470.80 → 3471.44] So it's kind of hard.
[3472.64 → 3474.50] Rivers says, sorry for the incessant super chats.
[3474.54 → 3476.48] It's my first time catching you live in the years I've followed.
[3476.62 → 3478.86] Thanks for all the education, entertainment, and companionship.
[3478.98 → 3479.90] Oh, you're very welcome.
[3481.94 → 3483.40] Gap to Granny.
[3483.78 → 3486.06] Have you checked out DJI's new first person view goggles?
[3486.26 → 3487.42] No, I haven't.
[3488.26 → 3489.86] Also got the float plane beta shirt.
[3489.86 → 3490.58] It fits wonderful.
[3490.90 → 3491.12] Nice.
[3491.28 → 3492.62] Beta squadron for life.
[3493.40 → 3495.08] And oh, speaking of float plane.
[3495.32 → 3495.68] Okay.
[3495.76 → 3496.10] Sorry, guys.
[3496.14 → 3496.70] That's all I can do.
[3496.94 → 3497.96] Speaking of float plane.
[3499.04 → 3499.48] 4K.
[3499.48 → 3500.22] We did all the things.
[3500.40 → 3500.60] Yep.
[3500.86 → 3501.70] 4K yearly.
[3502.52 → 3503.72] 4K yearly subscriptions.
[3503.92 → 3506.70] I don't think I put yearly prices in for the standard one, did I?
[3507.04 → 3507.72] I think you did.
[3507.96 → 3508.52] Okay, cool.
[3508.86 → 3509.86] You didn't do the...
[3510.46 → 3510.92] Yeah, anyway.
[3510.92 → 3513.46] So guys, you can subscribe at 4K quality.
[3513.46 → 3516.32] I think it's 10 bucks a month or $100 a year.
[3517.40 → 3518.68] And then 5 and 50.
[3518.84 → 3518.98] Yep.
[3519.26 → 3521.18] And it looks freaking awesome.
[3521.28 → 3522.20] How are the servers holding up?
[3522.50 → 3522.90] They're doing okay.
[3522.96 → 3524.40] Because we've got new creators on too, don't we?
[3524.52 → 3524.86] Yep.
[3524.96 → 3526.46] How many videos did you guys get uploaded?
[3526.70 → 3527.70] Uploading a lot.
[3527.96 → 3528.22] Yep.
[3528.36 → 3528.62] Yep.
[3528.70 → 3528.92] Yep.
[3528.98 → 3529.12] Yep.
[3529.12 → 3532.84] There are two different creators that have uploaded at least 40 videos already.
[3532.94 → 3533.16] Sweet.
[3533.66 → 3533.82] Yeah.
[3533.82 → 3534.54] And how's it going?
[3534.80 → 3535.54] It's going all right.
[3536.34 → 3537.18] It's going okay.
[3537.26 → 3538.02] You seem guarded.
[3538.02 → 3541.48] There were some problems, but it is going all right.
[3541.66 → 3542.94] The problems were addressed very quickly.
[3543.04 → 3543.78] The team's been doing great.
[3543.88 → 3546.70] Honestly, everyone on the team has been awesome this week.
[3546.78 → 3548.20] Everyone is very responsive.
[3549.64 → 3553.14] Dan got to flex his abilities a little bit more.
[3553.14 → 3554.40] Customer care superpowers.
[3554.62 → 3554.84] Yeah.
[3555.02 → 3555.22] Yeah.
[3555.30 → 3556.68] A little bit more than he normally gets to.
[3557.56 → 3559.00] But yeah, everyone did awesome.
[3560.18 → 3566.66] Yuri swooped in and saved two different situations while the call with the creator was live, which
[3566.66 → 3567.56] was awesome.
[3568.02 → 3570.64] That was really cool.
[3571.90 → 3572.26] Yeah.
[3572.44 → 3573.20] It was great.
[3573.34 → 3574.08] Great week for float plan.
[3574.14 → 3575.70] I won't keep you guys way too long.
[3575.70 → 3575.98] All right.
[3576.04 → 3576.68] But yeah.
[3576.80 → 3577.44] Thanks, guys.
[3577.56 → 3578.24] See you again next week.
[3578.30 → 3579.62] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3580.02 → 3580.04] Bye.
[3581.16 → 3583.76] Ravi says, my face won one of four super chats red.
[3583.96 → 3584.24] Sorry.
[3585.76 → 3587.04] That's two of five now.
