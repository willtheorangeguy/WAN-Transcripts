[0.00 --> 0.62]  No worries.
[6.20 --> 11.60]  And welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the one and only WAN show.
[11.70 --> 13.30]  It's going to be a great show this week.
[13.40 --> 16.10]  We've got a bunch of spectacular news.
[16.24 --> 19.80]  Your next BMW might only have heated seats for three months.
[20.58 --> 21.94]  Unless you pony up.
[23.32 --> 28.38]  Facebook's adpocalypse has arrived with, uh, wow.
[28.38 --> 34.38]  With advertisers such as Hershey, Levi Strauss, uh, Patagonia.
[35.38 --> 38.98]  Uh, wait, is, uh, what are they called?
[39.10 --> 43.04]  They're like the, like giant, um, hold on.
[43.10 --> 43.52]  Unilever.
[43.64 --> 43.76]  Yeah.
[43.90 --> 47.02]  Unilever have boycotted them.
[47.12 --> 48.26]  They're getting boycotted.
[48.52 --> 50.34]  They're getting boycotted, ladies and gentlemen.
[51.12 --> 52.30]  What else we got, Luke?
[53.98 --> 57.62]  Uh, there's some, where, where did it go?
[57.62 --> 60.92]  I want to talk about the global foundries begins 12 nanometer production.
[61.40 --> 63.08]  So it matters.
[63.20 --> 63.78]  It doesn't matter.
[63.86 --> 65.58]  It matters in some scenarios, whatever.
[65.80 --> 69.22]  We'll talk about global, uh, foundries producing 12 nanometer things.
[69.50 --> 73.72]  And Sony launches a portable personal air conditioner.
[73.74 --> 74.18]  Oh yeah.
[74.38 --> 76.12]  Portable personal air conditioner.
[76.62 --> 77.16]  Oh yeah.
[77.62 --> 78.62]  Oh yeah.
[79.06 --> 79.78]  And it's cheap.
[79.84 --> 80.44]  It's cheap.
[80.44 --> 81.04]  It's affordable.
[81.40 --> 84.92]  So we'll get to that in just a moment after we roll that intro.
[85.66 --> 87.42]  Uh, Luke, can you shift a little bit to your right?
[89.24 --> 90.10]  It's so beautiful.
[91.14 --> 91.50]  Perfect.
[92.00 --> 92.58]  Intro's going.
[92.58 --> 119.54]  We clearly have no choice, but to jump right into this Sony personal portable air conditioner.
[119.54 --> 128.88]  So the source is William CLL on the forum who says, would you look at this just in time for summer?
[128.98 --> 129.44]  Hold on a second.
[129.54 --> 132.70]  I got to find just the right spot to put this on this page.
[132.78 --> 134.60]  So I don't accidentally show something I shouldn't.
[134.70 --> 135.78]  Hey, there it is.
[135.96 --> 137.42]  Just in time for summer.
[137.42 --> 142.12]  The Rion Pocket was announced for crowdfunding in July of last year.
[142.66 --> 149.90]  And Sony claims that at, uh, hmm, at an ambient temperature.
[149.90 --> 160.18]  So that doesn't tell us what that ambient temperature is, but that it can cool the shirt that it's attached to down to 23 degrees Celsius.
[160.18 --> 164.60]  So let's go ahead and have a look at exactly how this works.
[165.08 --> 169.28]  Uh, actually, no, no, we're gonna, we're gonna get to how it works in just a moment.
[169.86 --> 172.36]  Um, okay.
[172.52 --> 173.50]  No, we're not.
[173.98 --> 174.56]  We're gonna jump.
[174.62 --> 175.12]  We're gonna jump.
[175.18 --> 176.04]  We're gonna jump right.
[176.14 --> 176.42]  Hold on.
[176.48 --> 177.64]  We're gonna jump right into it.
[177.98 --> 181.88]  They began sales Wednesday.
[181.88 --> 192.06]  Uh, the device tucks under your shirt and is worn in a slot at the back of the neck of a customized undershirt.
[192.58 --> 192.90]  Okay.
[193.00 --> 202.06]  So the wearer uses a smartphone app to turn the temperature down or up because the device can either absorb or generate heat.
[202.06 --> 213.08]  And it was developed last year after Sony secured, get this, $600,000 during a one-week crowdfunding campaign.
[214.58 --> 218.18]  $600,000 they raised for this thing.
[218.36 --> 226.50]  I need to get into the business of creating just completely stupid bulls** that people can put under their shirts.
[226.50 --> 231.40]  Here I am busy making shirts for, for LTTstore.com.
[231.66 --> 235.48]  And I, what I should really be making is shirts and shirt accessories.
[236.24 --> 241.10]  Uh, so Sony set the suggested retail price at 13,000 yen.
[241.80 --> 243.02]  What is that?
[243.58 --> 244.26]  What's it says?
[244.38 --> 246.64]  Cost of device is $14.88.
[246.92 --> 247.74]  So it's about $15.
[247.74 --> 249.64]  Cost of shirt is $16.74.
[250.04 --> 251.56]  So this is a $30 solution.
[251.76 --> 252.62]  And here we go.
[252.66 --> 254.70]  I've been, I've been, I've been holding off on this.
[254.80 --> 255.36]  Been holding off.
[255.36 --> 256.36]  That's pretty cheap.
[256.50 --> 262.36]  So at an ambient temperature, at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees Celsius.
[263.54 --> 265.56]  Uh, wait, is that 40 degrees Celsius?
[266.08 --> 266.36]  Okay.
[266.40 --> 270.60]  This must be, this must be 40 degrees Celsius for the hottest thing in the room, but we don't
[270.60 --> 271.56]  know what that is.
[271.56 --> 276.84]  So we don't know what the actual ambient temperature is, but something, something 13 degrees Celsius
[276.84 --> 277.36]  cooler.
[278.14 --> 285.36]  So basically it's, uh, it, it does say that it, it, it basically just creates a lot of
[285.36 --> 286.68]  cold spot.
[286.68 --> 287.18]  Yeah.
[287.18 --> 293.72]  It doesn't like properly actually cool your whole upper body down.
[294.10 --> 294.62]  Right.
[294.62 --> 296.92]  It just kind of creates one cold spot.
[296.92 --> 301.24]  So the biggest thing for me, I, I overheat in every scenario ever.
[301.46 --> 303.84]  So this is actually mildly interesting.
[303.84 --> 304.32]  Thank you.
[304.48 --> 306.12]  Uh, this is mildly interesting to me.
[306.12 --> 306.44]  Yeah.
[306.62 --> 312.64]  But, and I don't often care about this stuff, but to a certain degree, like, there's this
[312.64 --> 314.14]  big like box on your back.
[314.84 --> 315.86]  Well, you know what?
[315.92 --> 316.66]  Hold on a second.
[316.78 --> 317.46]  Let's have a look.
[317.80 --> 319.24]  No, let's have a look at the device.
[319.24 --> 319.52]  Okay.
[319.68 --> 321.88]  Cause it tucks inside the shirt.
[321.88 --> 322.26]  Right.
[322.82 --> 323.08]  Yeah.
[323.08 --> 324.16]  Have you watched the video?
[324.84 --> 326.16]  Uh, I haven't yet.
[326.22 --> 326.90]  I haven't yet.
[326.94 --> 328.60]  I was going to play the video on the show.
[328.68 --> 332.44]  I wanted to, I've, I've already heard about this and I remember the original crowdfunding
[332.44 --> 333.02]  campaign.
[333.16 --> 335.64]  When I looked at this thing and I was like, that's just a tech.
[336.92 --> 341.78]  And, uh, then I think we might've even covered it on the WAN show back when this was happening,
[341.78 --> 348.60]  but I think we just kind of moved on pretty quickly because it completely didn't matter.
[348.60 --> 351.90]  Um, sorry, one second.
[351.90 --> 358.36]  I just need to, uh, send a little common sense, um, reminder to someone.
[359.36 --> 365.20]  Uh, okay.
[366.04 --> 369.78]  Um, yeah, so I think we moved on from it pretty quickly.
[369.88 --> 373.76]  I didn't, I didn't necessarily think anything was going to come of this, but let's go ahead.
[373.92 --> 377.06]  Let's, let's enjoy the video here together.
[377.06 --> 377.68]  Shall we?
[378.60 --> 380.54]  Give me, give me a second here.
[380.66 --> 381.50]  Give me a second here.
[381.58 --> 383.60]  I'm just gonna, I'm going to turn the sound down.
[384.14 --> 384.26]  Yeah.
[384.28 --> 386.84]  Oh, wait, no, this is not, this is not working.
[386.98 --> 387.40]  Hold on.
[387.50 --> 388.96]  Wait, can I wait?
[389.02 --> 389.52]  Yes, I can.
[389.58 --> 389.82]  Hold on.
[389.84 --> 391.92]  I just need to do this very, very, very carefully.
[392.78 --> 394.44]  Careful, careful, careful, careful.
[394.72 --> 395.26]  And stop.
[395.54 --> 396.02]  There we go.
[396.88 --> 397.28]  Okay.
[397.32 --> 398.46]  So here's this guy.
[399.38 --> 402.36]  He is, someone is sweating.
[403.78 --> 406.10]  A different, another guy is not sweating.
[407.14 --> 407.98]  Oh, wow.
[407.98 --> 409.60]  Are you skipping through it?
[409.76 --> 410.68]  So cheesy.
[410.88 --> 412.16]  No, I'm watching the whole thing.
[412.16 --> 412.26]  Okay.
[413.12 --> 419.20]  You got, you got to see it like, maybe pause at, I'm going to get you a second.
[420.48 --> 422.52]  Pause at 18 seconds.
[422.82 --> 423.74]  18 seconds.
[423.92 --> 424.34]  Okay.
[424.84 --> 426.34]  Uh, yeah.
[426.52 --> 426.98]  Okay.
[426.98 --> 428.32]  Oh, wow.
[428.32 --> 428.60]  Yeah.
[428.60 --> 429.82]  That's not great.
[430.52 --> 431.88]  That's what I'm talking about.
[432.12 --> 437.58]  And that, that looks like that's his, his dress shirt over top of, cause it's more of an undershirt,
[437.68 --> 437.88]  right?
[438.20 --> 438.50]  Yes.
[438.56 --> 438.78]  Yes.
[438.82 --> 439.10]  Yes.
[439.38 --> 441.18]  That's his dress shirt over top of it.
[441.18 --> 446.02]  So you already have the maximum amount of masking that you could have going on.
[446.36 --> 446.84]  Yeah.
[446.84 --> 447.12]  Yeah.
[447.12 --> 449.32]  Unless you put like a jacket on top of that.
[450.10 --> 450.40]  Yeah.
[451.06 --> 453.88]  But then it's going to function very well through that jacket as well.
[453.88 --> 458.94]  You know, what's interesting to me about the thermal camera image though, is not necessarily
[458.94 --> 467.90]  the cold spot here, but rather the, the generally cooler, uh, spot under the shirt.
[467.90 --> 473.10]  And also what appears to be like a hotspot where the exhaust might be.
[473.24 --> 474.04]  You notice that?
[475.02 --> 477.18]  Where's the, what, what timestamp is that?
[477.44 --> 481.76]  Uh, no, this is in the, the thermal camera images from the forum post.
[482.40 --> 483.10]  Oh, okay.
[483.12 --> 483.52]  One second.
[483.52 --> 489.76]  So there's a generally colder sort of back of the person who's wearing it, but then there's
[489.76 --> 491.38]  like this hotspot on their neck.
[491.84 --> 497.90]  And I don't know about you, but I think that for me personally, having like a really cold
[497.90 --> 503.62]  spot right on my back and then like a hotspot on my neck, those things might kind of end up
[503.62 --> 504.82]  working against each other.
[505.12 --> 505.86]  It does.
[505.96 --> 506.28]  It does.
[506.42 --> 512.76]  Well, his overall body temperature goes down and that hotspot might just be a notably not
[512.76 --> 513.76]  cooled area.
[513.76 --> 515.22]  If that makes sense.
[515.22 --> 516.12]  I want to try it.
[516.12 --> 520.30]  I want to try it because I would 100% try it.
[520.30 --> 525.20]  I have actually found that like the best thing that I can do on a hot day is not necessarily
[525.20 --> 526.16]  drinking water.
[526.30 --> 530.42]  Cause I don't know about you, but I find when I take like chug, like a big drink of water
[530.42 --> 536.60]  on a hot day, even if it's really cold, I will immediately start just like sweating
[536.60 --> 539.72]  through however many layers of clothing it is that I'm wearing.
[539.72 --> 541.54]  Like it is absolutely disgusting.
[542.22 --> 544.66]  I mean that that is your body temperature regulating.
[545.16 --> 545.34]  Yeah.
[545.38 --> 549.94]  But like, why is it that when I take the drink of cold water, suddenly my body's like, I
[549.94 --> 551.06]  need to sweat now.
[551.48 --> 557.22]  Well, cause it's going like, okay, I have, I have the, the, the, the water in order to
[557.22 --> 557.74]  sweat now.
[557.86 --> 558.38]  I guess so.
[558.40 --> 558.94]  Well, I hate it.
[559.00 --> 564.32]  So I actually find I'm usually better off taking the cold drink, putting it on my neck,
[564.32 --> 568.44]  warming it up and then drinking, you know, less cold water.
[568.50 --> 570.42]  Like I actually find that works better for me.
[570.70 --> 571.06]  Okay.
[571.18 --> 571.58]  I see.
[571.80 --> 571.98]  Okay.
[572.24 --> 574.82]  So I would be very curious to try it.
[574.82 --> 578.40]  Now, if the exhaust heat just like goes up the back of your neck and you're just like
[578.40 --> 580.72]  cooling one part to warm another, that's pretty stupid.
[581.06 --> 586.70]  But if it actually manages to get the heat far enough away from your body that you can,
[587.10 --> 591.00]  that you can really, you know, cool down with this thing.
[591.08 --> 594.26]  Hey, it's a little humpback.
[594.90 --> 597.42]  But I, I could be talked into wearing it.
[597.80 --> 602.62]  I don't see anything about battery life in here or anything like that, but first flight
[602.62 --> 607.12]  sony.com man, official website.
[607.28 --> 607.92]  Oh, you know what?
[607.96 --> 610.92]  We should, we should probably go visit the official website together here.
[610.92 --> 614.76]  Ladies and gentlemen, 36 degrees, 23 degrees Celsius.
[616.08 --> 616.26]  Nope.
[616.32 --> 622.30]  This is pretty much all the, you know, oof, there's another picture here where the, the
[622.30 --> 628.94]  hump on the back actually looks a lot bigger than like the, the image where you see the,
[628.94 --> 632.30]  the undershirt and the device itself next to each other.
[632.76 --> 634.36]  That looks really big.
[636.16 --> 636.64]  Whoa.
[636.64 --> 637.08]  Whoa.
[637.08 --> 637.52]  Okay.
[637.52 --> 642.20]  So in the doc, it says the cost of the shirt is $16 and 74 cents.
[642.20 --> 644.52]  The cost of advice is $14 and 88 cents.
[644.52 --> 648.14]  I don't know where they got that from on Amazon.
[648.14 --> 650.66]  It's 22,590 yen, right?
[650.66 --> 651.64]  Mm-hmm.
[651.64 --> 660.30]  Just doing a quick Google search, uh, 22,590 Japanese yen equals 285 Canadian dollars.
[662.00 --> 662.64]  Really?
[664.28 --> 664.88]  Yeah.
[666.28 --> 667.30]  Auto mode.
[667.48 --> 668.24]  Hold on a second.
[668.80 --> 671.08]  It will automatically like.
[673.48 --> 674.08]  What?
[674.28 --> 677.64]  It'll automatically go get colder while you're walking.
[677.64 --> 687.02]  This is the most over engineered, like USB tech cooler that I have ever seen.
[687.02 --> 690.80]  Like, so it's, there's app control for it.
[691.02 --> 694.12]  It can cool or warm.
[695.20 --> 695.64]  Iris.
[695.92 --> 696.60]  It can warm.
[697.16 --> 697.62]  Yeah.
[697.68 --> 697.84]  Yeah.
[697.86 --> 698.08]  Yeah.
[698.14 --> 699.86]  I believe it can warm as well.
[700.52 --> 701.00]  Interesting.
[701.60 --> 706.10]  Uh, if I'm wrong about that, I, you know, I'm sorry, but ultimately like who cares?
[706.10 --> 708.50]  You shouldn't probably buy it anyway.
[708.98 --> 714.10]  Like here, why don't we just, why don't we explore and try and find a viable alternative
[714.10 --> 714.54]  to this?
[714.58 --> 717.36]  So USB beverage chiller.
[717.78 --> 718.08]  Okay.
[718.44 --> 719.08]  Here we go.
[719.96 --> 725.24]  Uh, you remember that one from Coolit Systems way back in the day?
[725.82 --> 726.08]  Yeah.
[726.20 --> 727.26]  That thing was so stupid.
[727.96 --> 730.26]  Uh, I'm pretty sure they still exist though.
[730.26 --> 731.58]  So here's a mug warmer.
[732.72 --> 736.90]  Uh, you know, I don't see, I don't see an equivalent.
[737.80 --> 740.86]  I can't believe the people who gave that thing a positive review.
[740.98 --> 743.68]  It like obviously didn't work.
[744.78 --> 746.92]  Like obviously didn't work.
[751.48 --> 754.08]  USB tech cooler.
[755.16 --> 756.28]  Hold on a second.
[756.28 --> 757.20]  Okay.
[757.44 --> 757.96]  Alibaba.
[758.18 --> 759.30]  Alibaba.com.
[759.38 --> 759.90]  Here we go.
[760.48 --> 761.42]  Oh, I don't have a USB.
[761.68 --> 762.32]  You know what?
[763.22 --> 767.16]  Maybe they have actually created something that does not exist.
[767.46 --> 769.66]  Although some of this stuff looks pretty good too.
[770.18 --> 770.78]  Check this out.
[770.84 --> 774.94]  We've got the personal portable air cooling neck band fan.
[775.52 --> 776.72]  I'm liking that one.
[778.02 --> 780.98]  We've got the kid sized air conditioner up in here.
[780.98 --> 787.90]  I know there's like jackets and stuff that have had air circulation fans built into them,
[787.96 --> 789.98]  but I don't know if they've had like technically AC.
[791.50 --> 791.90]  You know what I mean?
[791.98 --> 801.88]  Did you see, uh, Adam Savage built a, uh, like a personal air conditioner unit, um, that could go in like a mascot suit, like a, like a fursuit type thing.
[801.90 --> 802.64]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[802.80 --> 802.98]  Yeah.
[802.98 --> 804.50]  That was, that was pretty neat.
[804.50 --> 809.12]  How do I drive a Pelte?
[809.26 --> 810.62]  You don't drive a Pelte L.
[810.66 --> 811.92]  I'm on a USB connection, period.
[812.46 --> 812.62]  Yeah.
[812.64 --> 812.84]  Okay.
[812.88 --> 816.66]  So here's why nobody's done a, uh, Pelte USB cooler since then.
[816.70 --> 818.26]  There's a good thread on Instructables.
[818.40 --> 820.96]  It's like, yeah, you just shouldn't do that because it's really stupid.
[821.26 --> 822.18]  So that's fair.
[822.28 --> 822.86]  That's fair.
[823.16 --> 831.36]  Uh, so I guess Sony had to do some pretty, uh, some pretty fancy engineering in order to bring this thing to life, but, uh, maybe they shouldn't have.
[831.36 --> 836.38]  So why don't we go ahead and move on to our next big topic for the day, which is.
[836.38 --> 840.78]  I have no idea how the, the doc got the prices that it got.
[841.36 --> 842.42]  I'm not worried about it.
[842.76 --> 846.54]  Your next BMW might only have heated seats for three months.
[846.64 --> 848.28]  This was posted by white brown.
[848.48 --> 849.16]  We called it.
[849.66 --> 850.98]  We called this.
[850.98 --> 853.50]  I mean, it's already a thing.
[853.68 --> 864.74]  Like Tesla is already including features in the car that you then activate, you know, later on down the line, you know, whether it's their, uh, autonomous driving.
[864.88 --> 871.24]  I forget what I, I have a friend who has a model three and, uh, he was telling me about a feature that, oh yeah.
[871.32 --> 872.36]  Uh, rear heated seats.
[872.36 --> 874.58]  I believe is, uh, is, uh, is a DLC.
[874.58 --> 878.00]  So he was like, yeah, I found out the hardware is already there.
[878.56 --> 882.38]  Um, and it's just like, you have to pay to unlock it or whatever.
[882.38 --> 883.58]  I'm like, really?
[884.40 --> 885.58]  Um, so here you go.
[885.70 --> 889.14]  After charging for access to CarPlay on a subscription basis.
[889.98 --> 891.14]  Holy smokes.
[891.18 --> 893.96]  I didn't even realize it was a subscription basis.
[894.74 --> 906.04]  BMW has mentioned during a VR presentation that the new BMW digital key service will enable software updates to existing and future models based on BMW operating system seven.
[906.42 --> 917.24]  Crucially, many options are now available as services with specific mentions of adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, heated seats.
[918.80 --> 919.52]  Really?
[919.52 --> 932.16]  a pay monthly i am like i'm happy to be you know right about things like this i guess but i am so
[932.16 --> 940.12]  angry that that you're right that they that they can't that it's not enough to pay you know
[940.12 --> 945.82]  thirty thousand dollars or whatever it costs for whatever bmw car forty thousand i don't know i
[945.82 --> 951.24]  don't know what a bmw costs i'd never cared um but like however many tens of thousands of dollars
[951.24 --> 956.38]  you're going to pay for this car and then you're going to get nickeled and dimed for the next five
[956.38 --> 965.34]  10 15 years on completely on stuff that's in there the hardware is in there and it's like
[965.34 --> 967.34]  specifically locking it out
[967.34 --> 976.70]  these options can be enabled via the car or the new my bmw app i mean is it my bmw at that point
[976.70 --> 984.22]  or is it your bmw and i'm just paying to use it some features can be permanently to assign to the
[984.22 --> 989.28]  car while others will be temporary with mentioned periods ranging from three months to three years
[989.28 --> 996.10]  so this means that for example heated seats could be enabled only during the winter months
[996.10 --> 1001.32]  which sounds like a savings until you realize that the heaters are clearly already in the seats
[1001.32 --> 1007.12]  anyway uh presumably features could also be disabled this way tesla for example has already
[1007.12 --> 1011.90]  done something similar by disabling autopilot on a used car as we discussed a while ago
[1011.90 --> 1018.90]  how infuriating is this out of 10 give it to me give it to me straight luke
[1018.90 --> 1034.72]  uh i don't know it i think it's gonna i think we'll see over time because if it like if it's done
[1034.72 --> 1043.34]  through the app it probably doesn't go with the car right so if it doesn't go with the car then it would
[1043.34 --> 1052.56]  erode the resale value of the car potentially or they are shrinking their product stacks sort of
[1052.56 --> 1059.48]  if that makes sense because they'll sell less variants of cars yeah because all the cars will
[1059.48 --> 1066.46]  have the stuff in it yep so you simplify the number of actual discrete skews that the um that the dealers
[1066.46 --> 1072.80]  need to carry on the lot so so far i've heard only justifications that are good for bmw though
[1072.80 --> 1080.56]  oh yeah for sure um outside of that like you got to give me a number luke i want your number
[1080.56 --> 1087.00]  how infuriating yeah how infuriating is this i think it depends on how much this stuff costs
[1087.00 --> 1095.74]  because like does it why why does it matter i think it does why does it matter if if if they
[1095.74 --> 1102.86]  make it so that over the course of let's say do we know what's what's the average time someone owns a
[1102.86 --> 1111.72]  new car for i have no idea because i don't think that uh well okay a i've only i only bought a new car
[1111.72 --> 1120.34]  once in my life and b i'm only you know three or four years into owning it so i i like i i just i have
[1120.34 --> 1127.02]  absolutely no context for it whatsoever i do remember reading an interesting article about how
[1127.02 --> 1135.70]  uh among uh it's more common for millionaires to drive like an older vehicle um than it is for
[1135.70 --> 1143.68]  people who are in like a significantly lower tier of wealth so it's almost like um it's actually not
[1143.68 --> 1149.22]  surprising like they kind of like outgrow a car as a status symbol and it becomes just like yeah well
[1149.22 --> 1154.50]  what like yeah i don't know it's a car or whatever you know like check out my yacht you know what i mean
[1154.50 --> 1161.02]  sure okay like like the like the penis measuring is less about something that rolls and more about
[1161.02 --> 1170.36]  something that floats you know yeah um well i just looked it up apparently in 2017 it was determined
[1170.36 --> 1180.22]  that uh average length of car ownership was 79.3 months or nearly seven years so if you would end up
[1180.22 --> 1186.86]  saving money which now that i know that it's seven years i highly doubt you won't then that would be
[1186.86 --> 1194.40]  cool um but again now that i know the average time is seven years i seriously doubt it and i suspect that
[1194.40 --> 1203.20]  this is just a a one on top of the other cost saving measure from from bmw and everyone else where
[1203.20 --> 1208.66]  they want to have less variance in their models and they want to make more money over time and they
[1208.66 --> 1216.14]  probably want to be able to make money from people that buy the car off someone's second hand
[1216.14 --> 1221.74]  you know what's gonna happen you know what's gonna happen because it's this this is i'm calling
[1221.74 --> 1231.04]  it right now i'm calling it right now the incumbent car manufacturers feel threatened right now they
[1231.04 --> 1240.08]  feel threatened by tesla they feel threatened by new upstart manufacturers that quite frankly like the car
[1240.08 --> 1245.74]  industry is going through a period of massive disruption right now so they're threatened by newcomers
[1245.74 --> 1252.16]  like tesla they're threatened by newcomers like nikola more importantly they're threatened by
[1252.16 --> 1260.72]  low-cost car manufacturers who are coming from places like china where labor is cheaper access to
[1260.72 --> 1269.80]  raw materials has the potential to be cheaper and the expertise that your volkswegans and bmws
[1269.80 --> 1278.48]  and hondas and hondas and toyotas of the world have built up over the last hundred years is not going to be worth
[1278.48 --> 1284.90]  as much as it used to be i think they feel very threatened because the internal combustion engine
[1284.90 --> 1293.24]  is still going to exist for a very very long time in much the same way that um you know a satellite phone
[1293.24 --> 1301.02]  still exists like there's going to be a point in the future where it's just all battery powered that's
[1301.02 --> 1310.86]  going to happen um so what's what's happening what i'm predicting now what i'm calling right now
[1310.86 --> 1317.62]  is that they feel threatened and they're finding ways to extract more profit out of the customers that
[1317.62 --> 1325.52]  they can retain over the next five ten fifty years linus talking about something he has no idea on
[1325.52 --> 1331.70]  lol no actually this is this is going to happen but you you you believe whatever it is that you believe
[1331.70 --> 1338.82]  um and then what's going to happen is they're going to introduce these these customer these consumer
[1338.82 --> 1345.28]  unfriendly policies like charging a subscription fee in order to access features that are built into the
[1345.28 --> 1351.16]  hardware of the vehicle and chinese manufacturers are going to come in at a fraction of the price
[1351.16 --> 1358.62]  they're going to be they're going to start out worse uh like that's we've seen it happen with japanese
[1358.62 --> 1365.60]  cars even going back uh of quite a few decades at this point but they came in kind of sucking but being
[1365.60 --> 1371.14]  lower cost compared to the incumbent north american car makers and then over time they grabbed market share
[1371.14 --> 1377.14]  by being cheap and then they used that market share and that volume of sales to improve their quality
[1377.14 --> 1381.72]  and eventually took over now we're going to see the same thing happen but it's going to be cheap
[1381.72 --> 1387.94]  chinese electric cars or if it's not chinese it'll be it'll be indian or it'll be something else
[1387.94 --> 1394.10]  and i think the the germans are going to be in trouble when they're running around trying to charge
[1394.10 --> 1402.44]  30 40 50 60 80 000 for a vehicle that you then have to have to pay these like stupid ridiculous
[1402.44 --> 1410.58]  monthly fees for and it's the kind of thing that has a very very very uh long-term effect so yeah it
[1410.58 --> 1415.94]  might not impact them for the next seven years or even 14 years and i chose those numbers because you
[1415.94 --> 1421.82]  were saying it was about seven years was the life cycle of a car from for a brand new owner is that
[1421.82 --> 1426.86]  right luke that was the average yeah so it might not affect your car purchase you've already made
[1426.86 --> 1433.72]  and it might not even affect the next one you make but at some point you're gonna get you're gonna get
[1433.72 --> 1438.28]  mad about it you're gonna say this is ridiculous and you're just not gonna do it anymore
[1438.28 --> 1447.56]  so good luck with that you guys does it feel like a like a death throw a little bit yeah like it
[1447.56 --> 1453.10]  really does it feels like one of those early like like one of those desperation moves where it's like
[1453.10 --> 1460.74]  we need to survive we need to turn we need to turn our cars into into cars as a service um yeah but but
[1460.74 --> 1467.14]  that's not going to happen what's going to actually happen is cars as a service is going to be more of a
[1467.14 --> 1473.48]  fleet ownership thing and they're just going to go to whoever is the lowest bidder because that's a
[1473.48 --> 1478.72]  commodity business at that point and so if you're going to try to build your business around maintaining
[1478.72 --> 1485.46]  that uh that experience and that relationship with the customer antagonizing them by charging them
[1485.46 --> 1491.46]  extra for things that already exist in the hardware is probably the wrong way to go about it yeah
[1491.46 --> 1497.56]  some people in chat are saying that um they they they don't think that the cost of the hardware
[1497.56 --> 1503.00]  inside the car will be subsidized i think it it probably will be to a certain degree on the high end
[1503.00 --> 1508.50]  if that makes sense so like i suspect the high-end cars costs will go down a little bit but i suspect
[1508.50 --> 1512.58]  the low-end cars costs will go up a little bit and they'll probably find a way to make it so that
[1512.58 --> 1518.10]  they don't really lose money on the hardware and they're able to charge subscriptions overall um
[1518.10 --> 1526.42]  yeah out of principle i will not buy a car that has a subscription fee to use there i'm saying it
[1526.42 --> 1530.66]  right now i will not what if there's no option what if there's no options other than that what if every
[1530.66 --> 1538.18]  single car requires some form of subscription and it because okay so uh i don't think they'll do it
[1538.18 --> 1539.32]  there's no way
[1539.32 --> 1546.28]  what what if like something in the car has a subscription but you don't care about it
[1547.16 --> 1552.98]  but then i'm implicitly supporting this business aren't i
[1552.98 --> 1558.92]  yeah not even implicitly i am explicitly supporting that business it becomes the norm
[1558.92 --> 1563.08]  that like every car has some form of subscription thing in it
[1563.08 --> 1570.50]  what do you think also what do you someone in chat said just jailbreak it what do you think about that
[1570.50 --> 1578.16]  um hacking cars is already a thing it is already a thing for the benefit of the user
[1578.16 --> 1583.60]  i don't think is a thing yet that's a thing that's a thing there's a canadian company that was offering
[1583.60 --> 1590.34]  tesla's um uh what's it called i don't know it's some kind of performance boost thing on the model 3
[1590.34 --> 1596.82]  they were offering it at half the price of the model 3 now i i'm gonna say that i think that that's
[1596.82 --> 1605.30]  fairly um selling hacks fairly yeah selling hacks is is probably not gonna take off the way that these
[1605.30 --> 1615.70]  guys hope it might um but in terms of you know jailbreaking slash uh rooting um i would be
[1615.70 --> 1622.98]  supportive of something like that if it weren't for my discomfort around the amount of autonomy that
[1622.98 --> 1629.16]  future cars are going to have and how that might impact it i mean what if you what if it was not
[1629.16 --> 1636.22]  implemented quite correctly and it caused some kind of system malfunction and you you'll run over
[1636.22 --> 1645.70]  a lady walking your dog that that's a life a life ending slash life altering thing and i just you know
[1645.70 --> 1652.24]  maybe i'm just being paranoid but i i don't think that when it comes to a motor vehicle that i would
[1652.24 --> 1658.82]  that i would be interested in any kind of like hacky uh feature alteration honestly
[1658.82 --> 1669.78]  i don't know if that was your original question no it kind of was i i just i i suspect that that
[1669.78 --> 1674.74]  type of reasoning will be why they will be able to hold on their grip to their subscription model
[1674.74 --> 1680.18]  um we've got a couple good examples hold on luca let me jump in here really quick we've got a couple
[1680.18 --> 1688.56]  good examples of things that already exist as as options in cars so onstar is uh an example of a
[1688.56 --> 1693.86]  service where the hardware is in the car but you don't get it unless you subscribe to it that's fair
[1693.86 --> 1703.56]  but onstar is in my opinion um not an applicable example because onstar has actual like concierge
[1703.56 --> 1709.36]  service like people that you can call and talk to uh you know when you need help and after an accident
[1709.36 --> 1714.12]  or whatever and my understanding is that some of that monthly cost would actually go towards
[1714.12 --> 1719.36]  maintaining a cellular service subscription which is something that for better or for worse
[1719.36 --> 1724.06]  is something that we have to pay for on a monthly basis that's just like how that works there's no
[1724.06 --> 1729.92]  um you know just like government subsidized you know everybody has a basic cellular connection
[1729.92 --> 1738.88]  thing um so that's one example another example is sirius xm radio so that again i don't feel is an
[1738.88 --> 1745.48]  applicable example because here you are actually licensing access to content so to me that's
[1745.48 --> 1752.94]  more like a subscription to youtube music or spotify and it's not literally sending power that you are
[1752.94 --> 1762.90]  generating through fuel to a uh device in your car it's it's more than that yeah so i i disagree i
[1762.90 --> 1768.30]  disagree with those examples i don't think those are the same thing yeah uh someone brought up a
[1768.30 --> 1774.62]  really interesting point in the youtube chat about how uh modifying or you know jailbreaking your car
[1774.62 --> 1780.76]  could have insurance implications and that's a really great point and i could 100 see that happening
[1780.76 --> 1789.54]  even if the modification that i made did not in any way affect the safety of the vehicle if you know
[1789.54 --> 1797.22]  knock on wood if something were to happen and my insurance didn't cover me you know all of a sudden
[1797.22 --> 1802.72]  i could be on the hook for paying i mean it is very easy for an insurance claim to be a million two
[1802.72 --> 1809.26]  million five million dollars uh you know you could end up in a situation where because you you know
[1809.26 --> 1814.50]  wanted to go a little faster and didn't feel like paying tesla the money your insurance is invalidated
[1814.50 --> 1820.82]  and you're in debt for the entire rest of your life that's that's that's a life-changing life
[1820.82 --> 1825.60]  ruining that's interesting because if you know how i don't know if they're actually doing this or not
[1825.60 --> 1829.66]  so my bad if they're not but you know how tesla was talking about how they would be handling the
[1829.66 --> 1834.88]  insurance claims for autopilot mistakes yeah what did happen with that i'm not sure but go ahead i i
[1834.88 --> 1841.76]  can't remember they were if you mess with their car i'm sure they wouldn't oh yeah i wouldn't they're
[1841.76 --> 1849.34]  going to like take control essentially of the insurance of their cars they can take control of
[1849.34 --> 1860.66]  basically the viability of hacking the car yep yep another really interesting point this is again in
[1860.66 --> 1867.12]  the youtube chat is you know one thing that offends uh hold on where are you okay sorry i didn't catch
[1867.12 --> 1874.48]  your name oh r potter tg t16 terrible username try better um one thing that they brought up was
[1874.48 --> 1879.46]  heated seats are heavy and reduce gas mileage i don't want to lug those around if i can't use them
[1879.46 --> 1886.68]  that's a great point because not only is there just the offensiveness of buying hardware that you don't
[1886.68 --> 1892.84]  get to use unless you buy it again but there's the there's the wastefulness and not just the wastefulness
[1892.84 --> 1899.88]  of including those materials in the seats in the first place but the wastefulness of just burning
[1899.88 --> 1905.66]  gas to carry around weight that you are never going to use yep
[1905.66 --> 1916.66]  kind of brutal i hate it i hate it so there you go i'm i'm saying it now i will not buy a car that has
[1916.66 --> 1923.46]  a monthly subscription fee for features that i consider to be hardware if will you be will you
[1923.46 --> 1930.08]  just buy like super old cars at that point like say we're like we're 20 years in the future these
[1930.08 --> 1938.42]  cars became an absolute norm uh uh five years from now so you have to buy 15 year old cars would you do
[1938.42 --> 1946.68]  that okay i want to say after that you'd buy a 20 year old car i want to say i want to say yes i want
[1946.68 --> 1954.32]  to say yes but i also told myself i'd never buy dlc and i did buy a couple dlcs for anno 1800 with that
[1954.32 --> 1961.38]  said i they're they are like completely new regions that were designed they're not just like dumb skins
[1961.38 --> 1966.34]  or whatever and i've put a lot of hours into the game and these are exactly the kinds of justifications
[1966.34 --> 1974.18]  that have people spending 150 200 on a game these days which is brutal um to be fair does it feel
[1974.18 --> 1979.42]  more like expansiony it does feel more like an expansion pack which i have bought before and i
[1979.42 --> 1987.12]  don't inherently object to and i did follow my my expansion pack policy in the sense that i waited
[1987.12 --> 1993.98]  for all the dlcs to be done and wrapped up so that i know that there's one final price that i'm paying
[1993.98 --> 1998.46]  for the entire rest of the content that goes with that game so i didn't like buy one season's pass
[1998.46 --> 2003.62]  and then another season's pass i waited until the comprehensive season's pass was available that
[2003.62 --> 2008.38]  includes everything forever and i got that one that includes everything that was ever out before
[2008.38 --> 2014.70]  and everything that's coming after that uh edc for a may uh said that we missed the mark on the
[2014.70 --> 2018.96]  lower manufacturing costs of streamlining the production of the seats so that they all just
[2018.96 --> 2023.76]  contain the heated seats so that's a fair point that is a very fair point because it simplifies
[2023.76 --> 2031.72]  the product stack and saves something like it it adds efficiency there but my counter to that
[2031.72 --> 2038.24]  is that if you are improving the efficiency of your product lineup in that way then it really isn't that
[2038.24 --> 2045.30]  difficult like if it really isn't worth it to you to take the heating element out then you could
[2045.30 --> 2051.96]  probably just not charge that much more and heated seats could just be a standard feature on your cars
[2051.96 --> 2053.20]  which would be pretty sweet
[2053.20 --> 2065.68]  that's not very capitalist linus well you know what come on maybe i'm a maybe i'm a disgusting socialist
[2065.68 --> 2072.32]  gross whatever i don't know what what a cuck is that is that a good insult for socialists

[2354.94 --> 2366.10]  let's move uh let's talk about the facebook adpocalypse you know what this is actually making
[2366.10 --> 2374.14]  me so happy this is like as crazy as it as these words coming out of my mouth are going to sound
[2374.14 --> 2384.54]  this feels like what responsible capitalism might look like okay what a stream what a wancho i know
[2384.54 --> 2392.08]  okay i know but hear me out for the first time in its history facebook is facing an organized boycott
[2392.08 --> 2400.48]  from advertisers we're seeing people voting with their wallets potentially towards these companies
[2400.48 --> 2405.44]  so these companies feel like they need to vote with their wallets towards facebook with their big
[2405.44 --> 2416.76]  wallets against facebook so uh two as of july 1st 240 companies across many industries have signed
[2416.76 --> 2423.32]  on to the hashtag stop hate for profit campaign uh these include hershey honda verizon target ben and
[2423.32 --> 2428.38]  jerry's dash lane eddie bauer jansport levi strauss and co made well magnolia pictures mozilla the
[2428.38 --> 2435.12]  north face patagonia patreon sap upwork kind it's a health snack brand apparently and sony which
[2435.12 --> 2440.44]  reportedly said on july 2nd it would suspend ads on facebook and instagram through the end of the
[2440.44 --> 2446.08]  month why does every single company not have a description and then kind is like health snack
[2446.08 --> 2455.40]  brand i've never heard of them really yeah so uh kind founder uh daniel lubetski lubetski whatever it
[2455.40 --> 2461.34]  doesn't matter if they said if facebook doesn't take visible measurable and assertive efforts to
[2461.34 --> 2466.94]  effectively prevent the promotion of hate division defamation and misinformation by this year's end
[2466.94 --> 2472.34]  we will feel compelled to evaluate indefinitely suspending our investments in facebook until they
[2472.34 --> 2479.50]  do so some companies you think this is this is good you are you are you promote this you like this right
[2479.50 --> 2487.64]  i what i like about it is companies taking a freaking stand for a change
[2487.64 --> 2497.62]  okay but but so the direction i was going in with that i guess is that you want facebook to censor
[2497.62 --> 2504.50]  things that uh have to do with hate division defamation and misinformation i don't necessarily i think censor
[2504.50 --> 2511.70]  is the wrong word but i think that facebook could absolutely do more so i think they could do more
[2511.70 --> 2520.58]  to how do i put content as questionable or something yes or what because there's an interesting argument
[2520.58 --> 2530.98]  here yes uh that we are moving into a realm where corporations large corporations that deal in
[2530.98 --> 2537.14]  information yes social social media networks are are to a certain degree essentially information brokers
[2537.70 --> 2545.62]  um large corporations that deal in information are due to this going to directly control the information
[2545.62 --> 2552.90]  that you receive we're completely maybe they're controlling in this in this realm maybe they're
[2552.90 --> 2560.42]  controlling it in a good way hopefully all the misinformation is actually misinformation hopefully all the the
[2560.42 --> 2566.42]  the hate speech all that kind of stuff they get rid of it because uh harassment online is like a really big deal
[2566.42 --> 2573.46]  yeah kind of like like it actually is especially if if you're you're like someone of prominent figure
[2573.46 --> 2579.22]  because you you get all these voices hitting you at the same time uh division is is a massive thing right now
[2579.22 --> 2582.98]  the whole world is extremely divided all that kind of stuff maybe right now it's going in a good direction
[2582.98 --> 2591.14]  but we are we are pushing companies to take control of narratives and to control conversations and to decide
[2591.14 --> 2599.22]  what information we should and should not get companies not not only not governments but like corporations
[2599.22 --> 2606.90]  that are going to financially benefit off of controlling this information are now being pushed to do so
[2606.90 --> 2618.90]  so here's here's the issue um what they're being pushed to do is do a better job of it because frankly that's
[2618.90 --> 2626.26]  something they're already doing anyway so if the ship has sailed already they were trying to do so less
[2626.26 --> 2633.30]  and then people got mad as far as i know i could be wrong about this so i think a big part of the
[2633.30 --> 2640.98]  a big part of what has prompted this is uh facebook's extremely lax policies with respect to uh political
[2640.98 --> 2650.90]  ads so they're allowing blatantly false provably false uh information to be micro targeted and as we
[2650.90 --> 2660.18]  as we talked about on a previous when show uh you know facebook has ad target groups as granular as
[2660.18 --> 2668.02]  uh you know people who believe in misinformation um uh you know people people uh what was that
[2668.02 --> 2672.66]  category that we talked about i forget this was a couple months ago do you remember i don't remember
[2672.66 --> 2679.30]  but i know what you're talking about yeah i yeah i can't remember exactly what it was but so so do you
[2679.30 --> 2688.50]  think it you would prefer like a a basically a mass banning of pseudoscience a bunch of people in
[2688.50 --> 2694.10]  twitch chat are saying pseudoscience oh man yeah pseudoscience that was it that was the word yep um
[2694.10 --> 2700.98]  thank you chat uh so you're talking more of a mass banning or blockage of the category we've got to be
[2700.98 --> 2707.70]  careful with the words because when you say sensor or ban or block that's not what i'm asking for
[2708.26 --> 2715.38]  what i'm asking is that in the age of information people should have access to the best information that
[2715.38 --> 2722.34]  they can and right now one of the biggest problems we have is that you can it's very difficult to get
[2722.34 --> 2728.98]  the right answer when you ask the wrong question right because it's really simple to find good
[2728.98 --> 2734.98]  information if your google foo is strong but here's something that i encountered the other day uh yeah here
[2734.98 --> 2739.62]  we go i sent an email to a friend of mine because i was just i needed to talk to someone about this
[2739.62 --> 2747.78]  um a subject line just learned about shungite have you ever heard of shungite i heard about it through
[2747.78 --> 2754.10]  a dr disrespect meme okay it's like some rock or something isn't it basically people think is is
[2754.66 --> 2762.10]  powerful for some reason so what happened was i i googled wtf is shungite not not literally that but
[2762.10 --> 2770.74]  i basically googled shungite and i got this um i got this sort of you know how google will have um
[2770.74 --> 2778.10]  commonly asked questions about it and then the answers right like that's that's a pretty normal
[2778.10 --> 2784.50]  thing so here are some of the commonly asked questions about shungite what is shungite used for
[2785.14 --> 2791.78]  does shungite really work can shungite be harmful how long does shungite last and how do you recharge
[2791.78 --> 2799.14]  shungite if i were to click on something like does shungite really work uh and i were to get
[2799.14 --> 2804.74]  this is this is great and i were to get this is an elevated answer this is a bit effectively a
[2804.74 --> 2812.90]  promoted answer on google um this is from a site called blog.shoplc.com and it says if you purchase a
[2812.90 --> 2818.10]  quality shungite product that contains high amounts of carbon and fullerenes then it'll be effective at
[2818.10 --> 2823.62]  absorbing the radiation it stands to reason that the more shungite you have around sources of radiation
[2823.62 --> 2829.54]  the better job it is likely to do only the high quality stuff though dude this is not this is not
[2829.54 --> 2838.74]  the kind of answer that i am expecting i am expecting to have at least two different answers to that
[2838.74 --> 2846.34]  question uh one based on that there is um no research to suggest that shungite is going to heal
[2846.34 --> 2854.34]  your body in any meaningful way and one from someone who is clearly promoting this stuff um saying that
[2854.34 --> 2858.98]  you know yeah definitely buy more the more you have the better um then there's sort of what i'm
[2858.98 --> 2864.66]  talking about with respect to asking the wrong questions so if you ask a question like how do you
[2864.66 --> 2871.94]  recharge shungite um what you really what you really need to know is that this is pseudoscience
[2873.22 --> 2881.14]  magic crystals nonsense but instead the answer that i get from kareli and heritage.com is to
[2881.14 --> 2887.62]  recharge shungite you can kareli heritage i know it's so close to karen i was so like no like from
[2887.62 --> 2893.70]  karelia no no no no it's spelled differently um so here's how to recharge shungite to do it you can
[2893.70 --> 2900.42]  leave it for a day under direct sunlight or for a night under moonlight use the smoke from sage and
[2900.42 --> 2907.14]  incense or fire from a candle wash it under pure water or dig it in a natural soil for a couple of
[2907.14 --> 2914.90]  hours recharge it with the power crystals such as selenite amethyst or quartz the power crystals with
[2914.90 --> 2922.98]  the power the power crystals the power crystals and so you know for me what's really important is that
[2924.42 --> 2930.34]  someone researching shungite is not getting information from people who are selling
[2930.34 --> 2936.34]  shungite or if they are they are also getting information from people who are not selling
[2936.34 --> 2941.06]  shungite and one of the one of the one of the problems with misinformation is that it's so
[2941.06 --> 2946.82]  profitable and it's so prominent these days that it almost becomes like uh it almost becomes an
[2946.82 --> 2952.42]  unwinnable game of whack-a-mole because real scientists that have actual important work to do
[2952.42 --> 2959.70]  cannot be running around disproving every nonsense claim that someone comes up with i mean what
[2959.70 --> 2965.22]  happened to the burden the just the concept of the burden of proof the the burden of proof is on
[2965.22 --> 2976.74]  whoever is making an affirmative statement yeah okay so i guess so i want more information here yeah you
[2976.74 --> 2981.06]  want more information yes but but like google can't control
[2981.06 --> 2986.50]  like how is google going to control what you click on
[2988.50 --> 2993.78]  maybe they they go like hey here's an article that pertains like in this situation you asked how to
[2993.78 --> 3000.98]  recharge it so maybe what they do is hey here's an article on this person saying that you need to
[3002.02 --> 3008.82]  burn some incense and put it in the circle and and yeah click your fingers or something and then they
[3008.82 --> 3016.82]  also suggest another one that that talks against it i mean i had like but this is a controversial topic
[3016.82 --> 3024.58]  check out this this is a controversial topic and um you know you know whether you whether you link to
[3024.58 --> 3032.50]  an authoritative source like um you know mayo clinic or something like that um again though you know i don't
[3032.50 --> 3039.38]  know that that's a perfect solution because part of the problem with science is that it gets it wrong a lot
[3040.10 --> 3047.78]  um which is fine but people have to understand that science is a pursuit of knowledge not not a definitive um
[3049.54 --> 3056.50]  having of knowledge uh and good scientists there are bad scientists there are scientists that treat it like
[3056.50 --> 3064.98]  uh like uh like uh like a religion like like it's unquestionable but science is questioning what we're told
[3064.98 --> 3068.82]  that's the entire point of it um so
[3073.62 --> 3077.86]  yeah we've got people saying more information is as bad as only displaying the biased information you
[3077.86 --> 3084.58]  overload the user and they ignore it all well if they ignore shungite then that's fine i think that's probably okay
[3087.46 --> 3094.18]  and so okay okay so variel says how on earth is google going to manually vet uh millions of questions
[3094.18 --> 3099.94]  well i don't think they have to i think i think that you can paint with relatively broad strokes so
[3099.94 --> 3107.62]  all of those questions about shungite can be fairly simply redirected to uh you know a look kind of like
[3107.62 --> 3112.98]  what wikipedia does where it's like a disambiguation article it's like hey so you're asking this question but
[3112.98 --> 3119.94]  uh for your reference here's an authoritative source that basically says at this point in time there is
[3119.94 --> 3124.90]  no reasonable evidence to suggest that shungite does anything whether it's in a charged or discharged
[3124.90 --> 3130.82]  state and you sort of buy it at your own risk it's probably not going to hurt you in much the same way
[3130.82 --> 3136.50]  that you know drawing a special magic circle on the floor of your bathroom before you have a bath isn't
[3136.50 --> 3142.74]  going to hurt you it's just probably a waste of your time and therefore money but what is to stop
[3142.74 --> 3151.22]  someone in the uh pro shunganite community from saying that they are a night is is that not what
[3151.22 --> 3158.10]  it's called i don't know i don't know i don't know this stuff sure um it's just whatever uh from
[3158.10 --> 3163.14]  claiming that they are a researcher and that they have because it's because there's there's some i
[3163.14 --> 3167.86]  don't remember what exactly it was i believe she ended up on dr phil but there was some lady that made
[3167.86 --> 3174.10]  this drink that you were supposed to drink and i believe it got rid of like or no i don't believe it
[3174.10 --> 3181.22]  did this i believe it was claimed that it got rid of of cancer or something and it was this like
[3181.22 --> 3186.74]  horrible drink that like rotted out your body i don't remember what it was called jilly juice or
[3186.74 --> 3196.18]  something like that um she claimed to be a researcher she published books on this um jilly juice
[3196.18 --> 3210.02]  jilly juice yeah this looks like it this is it jilly juice how do i spell that j-i-l-l-y juice
[3211.70 --> 3221.86]  okay oh wow they're still around yeah so wikipedia when you go to the jilly juice wikipedia article
[3221.86 --> 3227.94]  says this article is a part of a series on alternative and pseudo medicine but they're
[3227.94 --> 3235.14]  not like directly being like yeah this is obviously they did say alternative and pseudo
[3236.74 --> 3244.10]  but that's as far as they went um it is claimed by his proponents to be able to cure an assortment
[3244.10 --> 3251.38]  of conditions including cancer and autism as well as regenerate missing limbs reverse the effects of
[3251.38 --> 3263.86]  aging and oh boy and quote unquote cure homosexuality oh boy the juice composed of a mixture of water salt
[3263.86 --> 3273.54]  fermented cabbage or kale is claimed to blah blah blah blah it's terrible and it like is horrible to take
[3273.54 --> 3279.46]  apparently it tastes disgusting and it just like rots you out from the inside uh drinking jilly juices is
[3280.10 --> 3286.10]  so efficacy on wikipedia it says drinking jilly juice is ineffective in treating ailments and cause
[3286.10 --> 3294.34]  serious harm including extreme dehydration and salt or death due to its high sodium content like this stuff
[3294.34 --> 3295.30]  is horrible
[3297.62 --> 3307.22]  it's terrible the claims that it makes are horrible the effects of it are horrible like it's it's dangerous and
[3307.22 --> 3314.18]  horrible yes but i believe the the lady that invented it has published books and claims she is a researcher
[3315.22 --> 3321.30]  so how as a search engine or a social media website do you get rid of this stuff
[3321.30 --> 3330.10]  because then she was going to like science route obviously other a little bit less
[3331.22 --> 3339.94]  forms of science have been like uh no it can kill you um yeah but like it's horrible someone in chat said
[3339.94 --> 3346.34]  not peer-reviewed though uh i mean she could probably find a peer to peer review yeah i mean that's that's
[3346.34 --> 3351.14]  sort of part of the problem is there's so much money to be made in magic remedies that um
[3353.06 --> 3358.34]  you know it's just a matter of finding you know like let's say you know population of uh north america
[3358.34 --> 3365.22]  is what in the neighborhood of like 400 to 500 million people or something like that the odds of finding a
[3365.22 --> 3371.30]  handful of unethical enough people to sell their soul for a few million dollars seems pretty good
[3371.30 --> 3381.30]  yeah i mean is this something that needs more needs more the problem the problem for me is that
[3381.30 --> 3389.78]  you know it's it's not easy to say okay well you know hey we we just need more government regulation
[3389.78 --> 3395.38]  of this stuff because unfortunately that can create its own completely separate separate set of problems
[3395.38 --> 3398.90]  i mean let's look at what happened with the whole net neutrality debate which is should not have been a
[3398.90 --> 3404.26]  debate should never have been a partisan issue and for whatever reason uh you know ends up with two
[3404.26 --> 3411.06]  sides where for better or for worse one of them is arguing that uh red is orange and the other one is
[3411.06 --> 3419.78]  arguing that red is blue um and it doesn't seem like if we can agree on a reality that it's possible to
[3419.78 --> 3429.30]  move forward on a solution to our real problems so there i don't have the solution but i do think
[3429.30 --> 3438.42]  that i i do agree that facebook could be doing more okay there i i have noticed that almost every time
[3438.42 --> 3446.18]  we've looked at one of these things wikipedia has done something they did something like like with jilly
[3446.18 --> 3451.06]  juice there was a big thing in the corner being like this is alternative and pseudo whatever whatever
[3451.70 --> 3456.98]  um yep with shungite if you look up shungite wikipedia is the first result
[3457.94 --> 3463.46]  um and someone said that there was a thing but now that i clicked on it i don't see anything
[3465.06 --> 3472.98]  um yeah i don't see anything about i actually don't see anything about the uh oh wait no uses has
[3472.98 --> 3481.62]  been used as a folk medical treatment since the early 18th century um okay antibacterial properties
[3482.50 --> 3490.02]  okay make use of water purine which so it it it says that like the rest of it will the the only thing
[3490.02 --> 3493.54]  that it says is confirmed is the antibacterial properties of shungite have been confirmed by
[3493.54 --> 3499.54]  modern testing okay but it does not acknowledge anything else at all so actually in this case wikipedia
[3499.54 --> 3508.10]  has not seemingly um really done much of anything to dispel um any disproven incredibly difficult
[3508.10 --> 3515.14]  i'm thinking to do click on the talk page i don't i don't do a lot of this where's the talk oh okay
[3515.14 --> 3525.06]  it's a tab in the top left hand corner oh okay uh yeah coronavirus 5g conspiracy theory oh lordy
[3525.06 --> 3533.78]  oh shungite can defend against the harms of 5g in relation to coronavirus that's a good one
[3535.06 --> 3537.38]  oh that's an amazing sentence
[3539.78 --> 3541.14]  my brain hurts so much
[3547.70 --> 3552.74]  okay ryan says i love how a moment ago you were simping for capitalism but now suddenly can't stop
[3552.74 --> 3558.42]  talking about the blatant issues of late stage capitalism lmao here's a clue ryan i'm gonna give
[3558.42 --> 3568.74]  you one for free it's not as simple as one way versus the other way ever yeah you're welcome why
[3568.74 --> 3575.78]  don't we move on to another topic here um let's see yeah let's just move on to another topic here yeah
[3575.78 --> 3582.58]  anyways my my thing was basically just that it's it's tough having done the tiny amount of stuff
[3582.58 --> 3588.10]  through the forum and whatever other stuff i've done um it's really tough because anytime you're
[3588.10 --> 3592.90]  like yeah this is this is obvious just shut that up it's like well okay there's essentially infinite
[3592.90 --> 3598.58]  other examples and how do you filter this stuff properly there's also going to be people that
[3598.58 --> 3603.94]  disagree with you sometimes and you can't just say that you are always right about everything because
[3603.94 --> 3612.34]  there's no way that's true so it's like ah it's rough anyways yeah let's move on what a great youtube
[3612.34 --> 3622.42]  channel idea this has got to exist already like just trying miracle cures i think it does um i i've
[3622.42 --> 3631.06]  i feel like i've i've heard of a youtuber that does that but i searched for miracle cure reviews and it
[3631.06 --> 3638.66]  it seems like some people have done some miracle cure like reviews but i don't see like just a
[3638.66 --> 3646.02]  channel that's been elevated to the top here a lot of it's about miracle hair treatment which seems to
[3646.02 --> 3652.82]  be a specific product or miracle gel which is a nail polish um one of the scary things about this is
[3652.82 --> 3658.90]  like stuff like the jilly juice like it can it can just kill you yeah like you're essentially doing
[3658.90 --> 3664.74]  medical trials on yourself without the potential well i guess maybe the potential of the better
[3664.74 --> 3671.70]  maybe the potential yeah oh i didn't mean of it working no i'm not okay okay like it's like medical
[3671.70 --> 3675.38]  trials when you start from medical trials you you get paid sure but you also have the potential of
[3675.38 --> 3681.46]  bettering humanity if they discover something like super valuable right but like some miracle cure junk
[3682.26 --> 3688.74]  i mean hey luke luke you know what i mean we discovered cheese from like scraping fermented junk off of a
[3688.74 --> 3693.22]  rock in a cave or something like that or is it cottage cheese i don't remember it doesn't matter
[3693.22 --> 3699.94]  the point is it's a matter of time before these yahoos discover an actual cure to something canada had
[3699.94 --> 3709.06]  some rotten bread we went really far with that the insulin or something oh i don't remember um all right
[3709.06 --> 3717.62]  so the evo 2020 game tournament has been cancelled and the co-founder was fired um this is kind of big news
[3717.62 --> 3723.06]  this week it was supposed to feature series like street fighter tekken and super smash bros
[3723.06 --> 3728.42]  it is officially cancelled and before the announcement major commentators players and
[3728.42 --> 3735.54]  companies pulled out of evo in the wake of allegations against one of the co-founders of underage sexual
[3735.54 --> 3745.22]  assault um yeah but there's there's been a lot so the the smash community as a whole is like on fire
[3745.22 --> 3753.86]  right now um it has been wild and kind of difficult to follow because there's been so much news and
[3753.86 --> 3758.58]  there's been so many people that have been called out and there's been so many people responding to
[3758.58 --> 3764.18]  being called out and there's people that after being called out have just deleted all of their public
[3764.18 --> 3770.58]  accounts on everything and there's people that have been like yup i did it um and there's people that
[3770.58 --> 3782.02]  have denied it and there's just it has been crazy um so yeah i the smash community is a crazy spot right
[3782.02 --> 3791.38]  now yeah i made a joke that one of the smash players uh might might win the next tournament by default
[3791.38 --> 3797.06]  because there might not be anyone else left oh man which might not be that funny of a joke right now
[3797.06 --> 3803.94]  yeah i don't know luke that seems that seems like some pretty edge lord edge lord stuff right there
[3804.82 --> 3810.82]  hey man you were making uh you were you were saying cuck all stream what well yeah it's not a swear word
[3811.54 --> 3819.78]  it's not a swear word sure it's not one of the george carlin uh words you can't say hold on a second
[3819.78 --> 3824.74]  hold on a sec seven words you can't say not in there not in there so i don't accept it
[3827.70 --> 3835.94]  okay fine fair um uh what are we even talking about uh okay so originally i don't know if there's
[3835.94 --> 3840.98]  a ton more to go yeah initially evo tried to move forward with an administrative leave plan for the
[3840.98 --> 3848.50]  co-founder but that wasn't enough to keep people from bailing um just brutal i mean the gaming community
[3848.50 --> 3856.90]  as a whole is going through a bit of a reckoning right now in terms of not just not just like
[3856.90 --> 3867.54]  hashtag me too but um accusations of people abusing their positions uh whether sexually or non-sexually
[3867.54 --> 3877.62]  luke looks deeply concerned i just i don't know i've been trying to follow some of this stuff and
[3877.62 --> 3883.70]  i hadn't heard about this stuff yet so i was reading this and like apparently he paid uh
[3884.74 --> 3892.02]  multiple boys age 12 to 16 40 bucks to jump in a pool in just their underwear for 10 minutes like
[3892.02 --> 3904.66]  what the heck uh and there was some other stuff where uh he paid someone named uh oh wait no no no
[3904.66 --> 3914.42]  mikey fam was paid 20 to show images of his genitalia as proof against an asian stereotype
[3915.30 --> 3921.22]  like what the heck is going on smash community is messy dude
[3921.22 --> 3935.94]  oh okay all right um well another news um one netbook saw one gx one seven inch mini laptop looks like a little tiny alienware
[3936.26 --> 3946.66]  51m uh the source here is lilpewding.com and this thing looks absolutely sick look at that it's an adorable little
[3946.66 --> 3952.34]  alienware clone i absolutely love it don't expect alienware like performance out of this thing because
[3952.34 --> 3959.46]  it's using onboard graphics hold on a second where's our uh seven watt quad core chip with intel uhd
[3959.46 --> 3965.22]  graphics and 24 execution units uh where are the rest of the specs here come on guys there we go
[3965.22 --> 3970.34]  eight or 16 gigs of lp ddr3 memory so it's not going to have the same kind of performance you might expect
[3970.34 --> 3976.58]  from a gpd win max 46 watt hour battery though that sounds pretty good dual fans dual copper heat sinks
[3976.58 --> 3986.42]  and a core i5 10 to 10 y so that is a wow it's a 10th gen processor it looks so cool like it does look
[3986.42 --> 3992.90]  really cool apparently there's an idea of being able to attach controllers to the side of it i know
[3992.90 --> 4000.42]  right hold it up that's pretty awesome i love it that's kind of all i got to say about that global
[4000.42 --> 4008.18]  foundries begins 12 nanometer production uh finally like global foundries was real quiet for a real long
[4008.18 --> 4014.98]  time there uh so they say their differentiated 12 lp plus solution is optimized for artificial intelligence
[4014.98 --> 4022.66]  training and inference applications uh target applications and solutions uh mobile apps processor
[4022.66 --> 4029.14]  80 higher performance greater than 2.2 gigahertz 45 area reduction so this is compared to their 28 nanometer
[4029.14 --> 4036.82]  technology oh okay okay that should be okay high performance computing networking though 60 power
[4036.82 --> 4041.86]  reduction with two times the number of cores greater than three gigahertz maximum speed and 55 area
[4041.86 --> 4051.46]  reduction that sounds pretty good so yay yay competition um apparently tsmc is basically at capacity with
[4051.46 --> 4056.98]  everything that they're doing for amd and not to mention everyone else right now and the rumor the word on
[4056.98 --> 4062.98]  the street is that nvidia is going to have to go to samsung for their upcoming 3000 series gpus so it's
[4062.98 --> 4068.66]  pretty clear that we could use another competitor in the cutting edge fab space so hopefully global
[4068.66 --> 4076.42]  foundries 12 nanometer process is freaking fantastic and gives us more options for cheap cheap computer
[4076.42 --> 4080.34]  hardware moving forward or electronics in general yeah
[4080.34 --> 4082.34]  uh
[4083.54 --> 4083.94]  is that
[4083.94 --> 4088.10]  is that it would we allow a shungite promoter on float plane
[4091.62 --> 4096.66]  this is see this is what i'm talking about it's hard isn't it like it's not that simple because the
[4096.66 --> 4101.38]  the stance that yeah i don't want i don't want to silence them i believe in free speech
[4101.38 --> 4109.94]  and in in that situation someone would have to pay to access their content yep so they clearly they
[4109.94 --> 4119.14]  clearly really want it and like you said that if dr disrespect didn't do anything like illegal
[4119.14 --> 4123.94]  that you would take him on the platform i know he's a promoter that's that's why i looked up shungite
[4123.94 --> 4133.46]  um by the way you're leaning out of frame again do you there we go no worries i uh so i i don't know
[4133.46 --> 4143.78]  it's it's it's difficult because how do you become the arbiter of truth well i don't expect i don't
[4143.78 --> 4152.02]  expect them to be the arbiter of truth i expect them to clarify when something hasn't been proven when
[4152.02 --> 4161.30]  it's an unfounded claim so then on float plane would we have to put a notice on every creator
[4161.30 --> 4168.74]  that anyone ever claims says something unfounded that they might say things that are unfounded
[4169.94 --> 4172.26]  because we can't decide what's true right
[4175.94 --> 4181.78]  i mean there's there's disagreements about events in world war ii between like russia and
[4181.78 --> 4188.98]  the states yeah for sure and quite frankly i don't trust either of them to give the story
[4189.86 --> 4196.26]  yeah i especially don't trust russia's version of events but that's a whole other conversation
[4196.98 --> 4203.86]  yeah um there's literally no debate about shunganite it's obviously false there's no debate to you
[4203.86 --> 4211.46]  between you and me and linus there is no debate there is a debate however there is people that think
[4211.46 --> 4219.06]  that it works i don't think it works linus doesn't seem to think that it works you obviously don't
[4219.06 --> 4226.18]  think it works someone thinks and like you know what maybe the shunganite one is a little bit easier
[4226.18 --> 4229.06]  but there are going to be ones that are more complicated
[4231.78 --> 4241.30]  yeah nothing is true everything is so one of my one of my core one of my core values is that your rights and
[4241.46 --> 4251.22]  where someone else's begin and in the case of something like um you know like uh let's say
[4252.18 --> 4257.94]  you know the problem with like words is that they keep getting um they keep getting warped they keep
[4257.94 --> 4264.98]  getting distorted um so i'm gonna say hate speech but i mean it in the like the dictionary definition of
[4265.54 --> 4273.06]  of hate speech speech that serves no purpose other than to divide and demean um and you know effectively
[4273.06 --> 4277.46]  what your mom told you when you were growing up you know don't build yourself up by putting someone else
[4277.46 --> 4289.14]  down that's that's how i'll define hate speech um so i'm i'm a firm believer in that um you know my right to
[4289.14 --> 4295.70]  enjoy my music ends where someone else's right to enjoy their peaceful day begins and that's that's
[4295.70 --> 4305.94]  how we coexist peacefully and harmoniously and everyone is happy shungite doesn't really um it
[4305.94 --> 4313.30]  doesn't really cross that line for me because unlike the jilly juicer jillian juice or whatever it's called
[4313.30 --> 4319.38]  unlike that where there's actual you know bodily harm being caused and you know for me the the value
[4320.10 --> 4325.78]  yeah but what if and like the 5g coronavirus whatever yeah what if someone like here's here's
[4325.78 --> 4332.50]  an example i'm not claiming anyone's doing this but i think shungite is actually too easy of an example
[4332.50 --> 4338.58]  so it's it's hurting the argument because there's there's and i can't think of any right now but there's
[4338.58 --> 4345.54]  going to be things that are a little bit harder to disprove uh than than shungite because magical
[4345.54 --> 4351.46]  healing crystals have been a thing for a long time and people um but but let's assume it talks about
[4351.46 --> 4357.86]  5g and coronavirus right 5g whatever not too yeah coronavirus let's assume that someone thinks that
[4357.86 --> 4362.42]  this will protect you from coronavirus and because of that doesn't wear a mask
[4362.42 --> 4371.62]  yeah okay so now we're getting into now we're getting into sort of like the you know the the
[4371.62 --> 4378.50]  value of uh of a human life right like to me the value of a human life is immeasurable because the
[4378.50 --> 4384.10]  only way that you can measure the value of a human life is in other human lives you know when someone
[4384.10 --> 4393.06]  when some some creature uh some human creature is uh unjustly destroyed uh basically what you're
[4393.06 --> 4399.46]  doing is you are taking all of the all of the time and work and life that someone you know whether it
[4399.46 --> 4406.34]  was that individual's parents or friends or whatever else and invested into this human being and you are
[4406.34 --> 4414.02]  you are destroying it you are nullifying it um so to me that that cost is not is not measurable
[4414.02 --> 4420.34]  in any meaningful way because every individual is in a way greater than the sum of every contribution
[4420.34 --> 4424.90]  that has been made to every person who contributed to who they are as a person that's the way that i see
[4424.90 --> 4434.10]  it fundamentally um and so you know damaging human life whether it is whether it's in the form of uh harming someone
[4434.10 --> 4440.66]  so that they're bedridden and cannot enjoy their life or whether it is killing them or whether it is causing
[4440.66 --> 4446.42]  them distress or stealing from them like to me stealing material is the same as stealing time
[4446.42 --> 4451.62]  because they worked for it and stealing time is stealing life you didn't steal an entire life
[4451.62 --> 4459.30]  but you sure stole some of it um as soon as you say okay yeah you know what this person's irresponsible
[4460.10 --> 4466.18]  uh conspiracy theory spreading is is damaging other human life i go well yeah that's that's a problem
[4466.18 --> 4471.78]  it we should probably fix this i don't have an easy solution though but again like so so someone
[4471.78 --> 4476.58]  in chat and i i've paused the scroll on it so this is from a long time ago but it was colonel sanders 21
[4477.22 --> 4483.46]  um this debate about i don't want to silence people is in bad faith action needs to be taken some voices
[4483.46 --> 4491.94]  don't need amplification sure but who gets to decide that yeah because what if what if some platform
[4491.94 --> 4498.50]  is run by someone who believes in this stuff or believes in something that colonel sanders 21
[4498.50 --> 4502.98]  doesn't like or believes in something that you don't like or believes in something that i don't like
[4505.86 --> 4512.66]  how do you decide that thing right now i believe again the person in chat you and me are all in
[4512.66 --> 4519.94]  agreeance about this topic but us three don't necessarily represent the entirety of everyone so how do you
[4519.94 --> 4527.46]  decide who gets to decide what voices don't need amplification that is a very difficult thing to
[4527.46 --> 4535.46]  figure out and nobody wants that difficult answer and measure of harm how do you decide that because
[4535.46 --> 4542.82]  the people that believe in the shunganite crap yeah might think they're being harmed by suppressing
[4543.38 --> 4548.66]  you're you're harming people by not telling people about shungite which could cure their space aids or
[4548.66 --> 4554.34]  whatever yeah and like again i think they're wrong and i think there is potentially a measure of harm
[4554.34 --> 4560.66]  there if i mean okay my example of carry the rocks on you so you don't have to wear a mask i made that
[4560.66 --> 4565.62]  up out of nowhere yeah that means nothing i'm not saying anyone's doing that but in this fictional
[4565.62 --> 4571.30]  scenario um it's not even that far out there given you can recharge it with moonlight so like
[4571.30 --> 4582.98]  um in the in this fictional scenario like yeah how do you decide which one has more harm scientists
[4582.98 --> 4588.18]  again we're jumping back to the jilly juice conversation as far as i know she claimed to be
[4588.18 --> 4594.66]  scientific in some way she published a book etc etc so where do you draw the line and scientists disagree
[4594.66 --> 4600.98]  about stuff sometimes so is this a governmental thing does the government decide which side to agree with
[4601.70 --> 4606.50]  yeah and hold on a second really difficult conversation who's that uh who's that doctor
[4606.50 --> 4614.66]  who's that american doctor with the tv show that basically promotes uh nonsense uh like nonsense cures
[4614.66 --> 4622.50]  all the time i can't remember his name but basically he admitted to just lying and fabricating
[4623.06 --> 4630.66]  like in front of congress at one point yeah dr oz yeah um you know that's one of those cases where
[4630.66 --> 4638.26]  you you've literally got this individual admitting to it in front of congress um that they're just a
[4638.26 --> 4645.22]  big liar and in it for the money um and yet doesn't he still have a tv show at this point i have no idea
[4645.22 --> 4655.22]  uh yeah i think so fine oh no final episode date july 26 2020 okay so yes technically the dr oz show is still running as of right now
[4655.22 --> 4657.62]  great
[4657.62 --> 4668.82]  yeah thanks chat thanks chat chat is now exploding with uh with answers here yeah it's great it's brilliant so
[4668.82 --> 4678.18]  that's an example of an actual medical doctor who sold out yep and uh so unfortunately we can't just put
[4678.90 --> 4682.02]  doctors in charge because doctors are people and people are fallible
[4684.98 --> 4690.02]  you know what listen to bodies of experts it's it's this is sorry i mean we could probably talk about this
[4690.02 --> 4696.50]  for yeah for this is an extremely extremely complicated subject i know it seems really simple
[4696.50 --> 4704.82]  when you first jump into it but if you really try to discuss action instead of just frustration
[4704.82 --> 4714.90]  the conversation starts to become extremely difficult so yeah really though tom cigars in the super chats
[4714.90 --> 4723.86]  has the has the real questions here garth brooks where are the bodies buried
[4730.58 --> 4735.86]  guys it's a meme okay it's a meme it's a meme just everybody just chill okay
[4737.94 --> 4742.42]  uh we should do a couple super chats before we close out the show today i'm just like depressed now
[4742.42 --> 4749.30]  because the world is complicated and broken and fixing it is hard ah voodoo child says shout out
[4749.30 --> 4756.34]  to my lovely wife who's not really paying attention unless she hears her name alana sup alana okay
[4756.34 --> 4763.38]  robert mail says old news pelche cooler poor battery life yeah the uh the stupid sony cooler uh tom again
[4763.38 --> 4769.06]  says linus why did you switch from 3950x to threadripper what was the rationale because i had to have
[4769.06 --> 4777.86]  more ssd speed than the playstation 5 pc master race for life that's like honestly the flimsy rationale
[4777.86 --> 4782.90]  that i provide in the video that isn't up yet it'll be up soon though um i needed more pci express lanes
[4782.90 --> 4787.46]  so that i could put a stupid overpowered ssd in my machine that will make no meaningful difference in
[4787.46 --> 4791.78]  real world use that's what i needed to do hey luke do you have your kickstarter hammer yet
[4791.78 --> 4798.42]  no cool jackson tint asks hey luke what happened to the floatplane app i reinstalled ios the other
[4798.42 --> 4807.30]  day and the app has disappeared luke do you want to get into that i will try to not uh blow up a building
[4808.50 --> 4815.38]  and i will try to not make this take forever but apple basically did not let us update the app
[4815.38 --> 4822.90]  in any way apparently uh jaden figured out that we would be able to push purely bug fixes because it's
[4822.90 --> 4829.86]  like not legal or something for them to stop those and um there was some theory about how we'd be able
[4829.86 --> 4836.58]  to keep going in that way uh but there was issues with a big update that's that's kind of here um
[4837.94 --> 4842.58]  it wouldn't be compatible with that but basically they wouldn't let us continue updating the app
[4842.58 --> 4849.22]  because we would not use apple's in-app payments we would not use apple's in-app payments because
[4849.22 --> 4858.10]  uh we operate on pretty thin margins and we literally can't so that's about it and i told
[4858.10 --> 4865.62]  them that and they were like okay well stuff it so we were left with pretty much no options uh so the
[4865.62 --> 4877.06]  what we're going to have to do now is push a a like content viewing only app to the apple platform
[4877.06 --> 4882.66]  so the apple platform will have no ability to manage subscriptions it will have no ability to view any
[4882.66 --> 4888.98]  content creators that you aren't already subscribed to it will have no ability to see payment history or
[4888.98 --> 4895.46]  uh or change the subscription type or anything like that the only thing you will ever be able to do
[4895.46 --> 4902.98]  on the apple app unless they change their horrible in my opinion illegal policies is uh view the content
[4903.54 --> 4911.30]  from the uh creators that you have paid for that is it we have to make a custom bad app just for apple
[4911.30 --> 4921.94]  thanks apple good job congratulations on making it so that your users get a worse experience yep you uh
[4921.94 --> 4927.14]  yeah you win you're the big you're the big winner here uh all right um
[4929.94 --> 4932.26]  uh
[4933.86 --> 4938.42]  uh hulling grew says hi linus can you teach me how to do a computer or tech review
[4938.42 --> 4943.78]  uh you just you watch ones that are out there you kind of figure out what your unique spin on it is
[4943.78 --> 4949.78]  and you you do it you the best thing to do is just start doing it and then you'll be really bad at it
[4950.34 --> 4957.14]  um and then you'll get better uh pro gogert says last year you said netgear is more enterprise focused but
[4957.14 --> 4960.42]  i think they have a deal with best buy because they're the only brand of brand of router available
[4960.42 --> 4965.38]  in store i think i said they were more b2b focused that doesn't necessarily mean enterprise enterprise
[4965.38 --> 4972.66]  and like um business are not necessarily exactly the same thing dave chapman says any recommendations
[4972.66 --> 4979.94]  on upgrading from a 1080 ti i've had the card for three years but i got the upgrade bug um man i
[4979.94 --> 4985.46]  would probably wait for 3000 series at this point if the sort of rumored launch period is anything to
[4985.46 --> 4991.30]  go by like there's pictures of finished cards out there in the leaks now i'd be surprised if it's more
[4991.30 --> 4997.22]  than a few months away so um that's a great time to pick up you know a 2080 ti or something like that
[4997.86 --> 5001.94]  uh james says you told me to comment on beat saber streams where are they they're on twitch
[5002.74 --> 5009.30]  not on youtube i can't destroy the youtube channel by streaming beat saber they're also on float plane
[5009.30 --> 5014.34]  and they're also on float plane but unfortunately i can't have more than one chat thing open in beat
[5014.34 --> 5021.14]  saber at the same time um oh man what a cool like chat streaming integration thing that would
[5021.14 --> 5029.46]  be like a chat thing that just like consolidates all your chats so you can multi-platform stream really
[5029.46 --> 5035.86]  easily yeah um i mean it could be done like super gludgily and manually
[5038.02 --> 5043.62]  actually it could be it that could be done it could and you could just have like color coding for
[5043.62 --> 5050.66]  which platform it came from or like a little icon it'd probably just be one hell of a mess but well yeah but
[5051.14 --> 5056.90]  it would be as long as you're not over a certain size like as long as you're kind of small
[5058.98 --> 5063.62]  what's that you have to pay for restream though i think restream apparently might do it really do
[5063.62 --> 5069.70]  they support float plane uh well i think they probably would it's basically the same thing as
[5069.70 --> 5073.46]  our restreamer you just have to pay for it monthly i believe oh and then ours is free
[5073.46 --> 5080.50]  well sort of oh i understand got it yep say no more okay cool um
[5084.74 --> 5092.34]  pricing it's not even that expensive philip rose asks do youtube channels get paid less when viewers
[5092.34 --> 5098.18]  with youtube premium listen with the screen off i have no idea i would imagine not though cd says do you
[5098.18 --> 5104.98]  know of any monitors that are 32 to 35 inch 4k g-sync hdr and 120 plus hertz primary use is gaming
[5106.02 --> 5113.22]  uh i mean there's that one from asus and then the other like acer equivalent one i believe those are
[5113.22 --> 5119.30]  both 32 inches other than that honestly i wouldn't go 4k for gaming like why what possible use could you
[5119.30 --> 5126.26]  have for a 120 hertz 4k display what what graphics card that's not you know gifted to you by
[5126.26 --> 5131.86]  an army of angels in the you know the arc of the covenant is going to be able to run
[5132.42 --> 5138.42]  like modern triple a titles at those frame rates at that resolution um honestly the samsung one that
[5138.42 --> 5145.14]  uh full disclosure the unboxing was sponsored but uh nothing i'm saying right now has anything to do with
[5145.14 --> 5150.74]  that deal um the samsung one that i unboxed over on short circuit uh we uploaded that video today
[5150.74 --> 5159.38]  it's 1440p 32 inches and ticks all your other boxes looks like an outstanding outstanding option
[5160.74 --> 5168.98]  and it's 240 hertz which is pretty sick okay so i just looked for an update on the coal bar hammer
[5168.98 --> 5175.70]  and there wasn't one but someone nine days ago said i wonder if i'll still be able to give this to my
[5175.70 --> 5185.78]  dad as a gift for christmas in 2013. thank you ltt community for memeing so hard
[5190.34 --> 5198.50]  that's funny all right thanks jacob uh something okay yeah uh as errol says i think the subscription
[5198.50 --> 5201.94]  for features is a way to get more people to buy a luxury car at a lower price and hope that they'll buy
[5201.94 --> 5206.10]  access to features down the line yeah that's fair as long as we see lower prices haven't seen any
[5206.10 --> 5211.70]  evidence of that yet uh justin says thank you linus and luke for everything you guys do been a follower
[5211.70 --> 5218.90]  since before the langley house hey thank you very very much anthony says there's no algorithm for truth
[5218.90 --> 5228.26]  yeah that's fair um i know someone personally that i am a big fan of i i like them a lot i respect them
[5228.26 --> 5238.02]  deeply and they believe in in ghosts and all this other stuff that i think is crazy it should not be
[5238.02 --> 5244.82]  up to me to stop them from getting information about that and it should not be up to them
[5244.82 --> 5252.98]  to stop me from getting information to counter that i think yeah it's a real shame in it i remember
[5252.98 --> 5260.98]  having the ghost conversation with someone at one point i was just like what i didn't think it was
[5260.98 --> 5266.66]  real i thought they were joking for like yeah i think it was years and then eventually ended up
[5266.66 --> 5273.54]  figuring out that i wasn't being trolled and i was like oh yeah okay yeah i had a real tough conversation
[5273.54 --> 5282.02]  with someone about uh fortune tellers at one point it's just like oh like what am i supposed to what am i
[5282.02 --> 5290.98]  supposed to tell you like i i at one point i i went from sort of uh patiently explaining to i think
[5290.98 --> 5295.94]  part of part of my problem and i think part of a lot of people's problem is that it's very easy to fall
[5295.94 --> 5302.18]  into mocking because you're looking out of the frame again by the way it's very easy to fall into mocking
[5302.18 --> 5308.42]  because it's like the idea that there's just magical clairvoyant people that can see the future is
[5308.42 --> 5315.06]  ridiculous um like it's actually straight out of harry potter you know oh you're getting to mocking
[5315.06 --> 5318.34]  uh i know see i did it already no
[5321.22 --> 5330.34]  the very definition of the word ridiculous is worthy of ridicule um and and i think that's you know it's a
[5330.34 --> 5337.14]  it's a big part of it's a big part of why you know we can't we can't agree because the more we
[5337.14 --> 5341.70]  mock and ridicule each other the more we're divided um i remember i was watching one of my favorite
[5341.70 --> 5350.18]  late night hosts and they did a bit on um jeff sessions where they did his voice but only sort
[5350.18 --> 5357.30]  of his voice it was clear what they were doing was a mocking southern accent and i was watching this and
[5357.30 --> 5361.54]  what was really striking to me about it i forget who it was unfortunately but what was really striking
[5361.54 --> 5368.58]  to me about it was the words they were saying were a message of of reconciliation and understanding
[5368.58 --> 5374.58]  but they were doing it in a clearly mocking tone of voice that would identify them as an enemy
[5375.22 --> 5383.78]  before anyone would ever actually um stop and internalize the words that were coming out of their
[5383.78 --> 5389.54]  mouth like it was extraordinarily disrespectful and it's like yeah we're just we're clearly never going to
[5389.54 --> 5395.14]  come together on this as long as we present our points of view in a way that makes fun of each
[5395.14 --> 5402.58]  other it's like yeah you know i'm i'm sorry this is real bad news ghosts aren't real but um you know
[5402.58 --> 5407.30]  at the end of the day if that's something that you choose to believe because it gives you closure over
[5407.30 --> 5414.42]  the passing of a loved one or because it explains uh you know some kind of uh episode you went through
[5414.42 --> 5420.74]  where you believe you saw something like that and you know uh that's what that's what helps you
[5422.02 --> 5427.06]  come to terms with it or whatever the case may be it's like it's not really any of my business to
[5427.70 --> 5435.94]  interfere with that i suppose um you know i can say like you know sorry there's no there's no irrefutable
[5435.94 --> 5441.94]  evidence that it's real um but it it becomes you know sort of a circular argument right because they can
[5441.94 --> 5445.38]  turn around and go well there's no irrefutable evidence that it's not real and then you can kind
[5445.38 --> 5453.22]  of go well did you ever take like a like a 100 level yeah like 100 level philosophy course it's like
[5453.22 --> 5460.34]  because i took half of one and even i managed to get far enough to know that the burden of proofs on you
[5461.78 --> 5468.58]  ah htc 148 i'm going to show this comment it was automatically flagged you can tell linus thinks he's a
[5468.58 --> 5475.22]  libtard but he's a hypocritical capitalist no no i'm just someone who thinks it's not as simple as
[5475.22 --> 5483.62]  either of those things uh i don't firmly fall into a right-wing left-wing capitalist socialist camp
[5483.62 --> 5488.98]  i mean i'm a business owner obviously i believe in some of the merits of capitalism but i also proudly
[5488.98 --> 5495.70]  pay my taxes to my you know disgusting horrible socialist canadian government and evade and avoid
[5495.70 --> 5500.10]  none of them to jump on your disgusting horrible socialist canadian government thing that you just
[5500.10 --> 5507.78]  mentioned yeah uh the commenter is probably american and our political systems don't even fall in line
[5507.78 --> 5518.66]  with theirs yeah like our our prominent right-wing uh political organization disagrees with the american
[5518.66 --> 5528.10]  prominent right-wing political organization on lots of things so like yeah i love this ever rope says filthy
[5528.10 --> 5537.30]  centrist i i own it i'll take it i love it i love it moses says linus just stop you're losing for nothing
[5537.30 --> 5545.78]  i'm not losing anything what am i losing nothing all i'm saying is it ain't simple and if you think it's
[5545.78 --> 5554.10]  simple you're wrong no matter which way you think it's simple um rivea says hey luke last february
[5554.10 --> 5560.58]  emailed floatplane asking to join the platform i was told by dan it might not be a good fit uh best way
[5560.58 --> 5568.58]  to find out if that has changed would be to um probably send another email a quick look at your
[5568.58 --> 5575.94]  channel would suggest that it's probably not a great fit if youtube is your primary um is your
[5575.94 --> 5581.86]  primary platform just because it's more designed as a supplemental income stream for established
[5581.86 --> 5586.02]  creators whether it's on other social media or on youtube and it doesn't look like you're that
[5586.02 --> 5592.10]  established but if i'm misinterpreted yeah this is a kind of difficult thing to explain through text
[5592.10 --> 5599.14]  so the emails that responded are i think good uh but good because we have to be we have to use a
[5599.14 --> 5605.46]  little bit less examples um but like full plane is not a discovery platform and will often include
[5607.14 --> 5613.22]  some amount of additional work full plane is positioned to make it so that there isn't a ton of
[5613.22 --> 5618.02]  additional work but there is some amount of additional work even just uploading the video and
[5618.02 --> 5622.90]  setting a title is an amount of additional work and you might decide to do some exclusive content
[5622.90 --> 5628.26]  ltt's been releasing some really cool exclusive content on flow plane recently um that's additional
[5628.26 --> 5636.98]  work etc etc and if you're a relatively small creator at this time all potential work should go into
[5636.98 --> 5644.74]  growth and flow plane is not a growth platform um so we we highly suggest that you focus on on youtube
[5644.74 --> 5650.18]  or whatever your other main platform is um as you probably won't be successful on flow plane right
[5650.18 --> 5658.02]  now and it would take away from your your work towards growth once you become larger the the pool of
[5658.02 --> 5662.74]  work will become a little bit smaller these things will start becoming a little bit second nature to you
[5662.74 --> 5667.86]  as you've been doing it for a long time and the potential of the financial gain is good because you can
[5667.86 --> 5674.58]  reinvest that into your business um in the in the way of of hardware cameras things you might need
[5674.74 --> 5683.86]  staff etc which can lead to growth in other ways um all right what else do we have here
[5685.30 --> 5690.42]  no that's pretty much it wow this was a really long wanshow so thanks for tuning in guys this has been
[5690.42 --> 5698.42]  a very unusual show i'm sure the like dislike ratio is going to be terrible because the thing about um
[5698.98 --> 5705.62]  you know saying it's not that easy as you make absolutely everybody mad so uh i'm i'm ready for
[5705.62 --> 5711.46]  that you know what i'm just not even going to read the comments on this wanshow i'm just gonna have
[5712.02 --> 5719.54]  i'm just gonna have a nice weekend got some great videos scheduled for this weekend so uh let's see
[5719.54 --> 5725.70]  what's coming out oh yeah we got the yongno uh i think i pronounced it wrong andy's been trying to
[5725.70 --> 5732.50]  coach me on how to pronounce words in chinese uh so we've got the yongno uh i think i'm saying it
[5732.50 --> 5739.86]  wrong again uh android camera it's like a camera but with a phone built into it instead of a phone
[5739.86 --> 5746.74]  with a camera built into it super weird interchangeable lenses and everything um got a really cool video
[5746.74 --> 5755.86]  coming uh that riley worked on where we're gaming this is it's so dumb we have lap there's a laptop
[5755.86 --> 5762.50]  that a gaming laptop with two screens and he set it up so that we had one controller one input and we
[5762.50 --> 5768.58]  have to play both of the games against each other at the same time and the games are rocket league and
[5768.58 --> 5774.10]  then some weird dragon ball z side scroller fighting game that's not fair he plays rocket
[5774.10 --> 5780.58]  league all the time that's what i said and i had never even heard of the dragon ball game i've seen
[5780.58 --> 5787.94]  him play rocket league at work on his lunch breaks constantly he's actually good at it yeah that's not
[5787.94 --> 5795.86]  fair at all totally unfair but i i will i will accept any challenge i'll accept any any challenge i'm always
[5795.86 --> 5801.30]  down to i'm always down for a friendly competition so those videos are coming up this weekend so i will
[5801.30 --> 5807.30]  look forward to uh seeing y'all over there all right thanks for tuning in guys hope you enjoyed the show
[5807.30 --> 5812.02]  today see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[5820.42 --> 5825.38]  oh yeah and you can buy our special shungite smoothie over on shungite
[5825.38 --> 5832.26]  smoothies.com thank you very much check discord real quick i should make sure that shungite
[5832.26 --> 5834.02]  smoothies.com doesn't already exist
[5836.42 --> 5843.38]  oh actually we probably should um i am not really in a position to comment on this other than to say
[5843.38 --> 5849.14]  that it's an obvious tragedy and as someone who spends a lot of time in the public eye and actually
[5849.14 --> 5856.98]  i was just talking about how uh sometimes tuning into a bunch of just hateful uh poisonous comments
[5856.98 --> 5866.90]  can be can be damaging uh but luke um i uh yeah daniel t posted in the chat a while back any thoughts on
[5866.90 --> 5872.74]  the recent news of wreckful luke actually had the pleasure of meeting him um so i guess it's probably
[5872.74 --> 5879.78]  better for uh him to talk about it i didn't like we weren't we weren't friends or anything i just
[5879.78 --> 5885.14]  met him in passing once um i just know you followed him as well and like you're huge into the wow
[5885.14 --> 5892.34]  community in the early days and now and and he was an amazing player and also just a super nice dude and
[5892.34 --> 5897.94]  i think a very positive part of that community for a very long time and a positive part of the the
[5897.94 --> 5906.42]  streaming community for a very long time as well um he he i don't never know the correct words to
[5906.42 --> 5914.50]  use in these situations he he passed away very recently uh he he did commit suicide um extremely
[5914.50 --> 5924.74]  shortly after proposing over twitter um which i don't know where to go with this uh the the some
[5924.74 --> 5930.02]  people have theorized that the the comments that he received for proposing over twitter um helped
[5930.02 --> 5938.02]  drive him in that direction he was uh he had some issues that were quite public for a long time he
[5938.02 --> 5943.46]  had done which i i think this is actually super cool and like a really interesting and good idea but
[5943.46 --> 5951.54]  he had done um like therapy streams where he met with a therapist in the past so this was not this was not a
[5951.54 --> 5958.10]  a secret or or hidden thing by any means uh someone in chat said did she say yes as far as my understanding
[5958.10 --> 5967.06]  goes which is limited on this subject um she didn't even see it in time uh so she saw that and heard of
[5967.06 --> 5974.82]  his passing at like pretty much the same time which has got to be super super rough um the she didn't know
[5974.82 --> 5982.74]  yeah the whole situation is very rough maybe listen to me less and and go look into it um yeah she was
[5982.74 --> 5991.30]  she was asleep yeah um but yeah it's unfortunate there was a bunch of memorials basically every
[5992.18 --> 5999.22]  server uh as far as i know retail and classic had some form of memorial which was actually pretty cool
[5999.22 --> 6008.50]  um it yeah it's rough uh just keep in mind when you're online that bandwagoning someone can actually
[6008.50 --> 6014.34]  be really rough and just because someone has a big following doesn't necessarily mean that they have
[6014.34 --> 6021.46]  the thickest skin um i think linus and i do do fairly well in that regard um it's not always easy
[6021.46 --> 6029.38]  but it's it's not always easy um it gets hard sometimes especially when you're like already
[6029.38 --> 6036.18]  internally uh beating yourself up for something uh when when the community gangs up on you for it
[6036.18 --> 6042.42]  it sucks or if there's something that the community doesn't necessarily know is really like personal to
[6042.42 --> 6048.74]  you for some reason yeah um that can that can really suck as well so just frustrated when you know i make
[6048.74 --> 6056.58]  an honest mistake and you know uh do what i can to correct it you know i can't change a youtube video
[6056.58 --> 6061.30]  so you know i'll put a comment i'll pin a comment that's like hey by the way we made this mistake
[6061.30 --> 6065.78]  and you know every other comment on the video is why is nobody talking about this it's like you
[6065.78 --> 6071.38]  literally scrolled past the pinned comment about what you're talking about to say that nobody it's like
[6071.38 --> 6077.06]  here you are criticizing me for missing something and you missed the most obvious thing i could possibly
[6077.06 --> 6083.14]  put in front of your face and the hypocrisy of that one drives me absolutely bananas um you know
[6083.14 --> 6090.10]  generally speaking what i find is one of the best ways of reducing toxicity going back to the early
[6090.10 --> 6099.62]  days of starting out as a youtuber is or has been to completely ignore it um but the problem with that
[6099.62 --> 6109.30]  is that it doesn't really um it doesn't really it doesn't really show other members of the community
[6109.30 --> 6115.86]  that it's like yeah we're all struggling with this and it's something that we all go through and that
[6115.86 --> 6121.86]  it's not easy i think it makes people think that it is easy and that it's not a big deal and that what
[6121.86 --> 6125.14]  they're saying and doing doesn't matter and that there's not a human on the other end of it but there
[6125.14 --> 6134.74]  absolutely is yeah and you never you never really know what um what people are are going through um
