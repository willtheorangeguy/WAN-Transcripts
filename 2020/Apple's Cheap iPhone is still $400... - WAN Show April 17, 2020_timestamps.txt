Defo fun to watch and listen with Linus & Luke covering a number of points  (ending made it all the worth while), keep up the great work (working in tech all my life can be hard from time to time... like Linus saying I TOLD YOU SO ... funny yet a serious point to note, still made smile especially at the ending!  Keep it up (dont mind the odd 1 hour video post either... TIMESTAMPS BY IMPERIALSTORM - funny :) yet cool  KEEP IT ROCKING!
