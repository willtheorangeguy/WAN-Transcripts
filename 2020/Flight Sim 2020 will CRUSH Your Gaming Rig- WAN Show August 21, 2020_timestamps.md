00:03:30 **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 - HEADLINE TOPIC**
    00:03:49 Linus and luke research how long it's been since OG flight sim
    00:04:17 Developers at Asobo have added some great features into the game
    00:04:26 1 to 1 ratio sized earth
    00:04:40 Buy it on steam and get the launcher
    00:05:23 Launcher is very buggy aparently
    00:05:37 Luke tells us when the OG versions of flight sim were released/sold
    00:05:52 Real time weather data?!
    00:06:13 What about natural disasters?
    00:06:53 Life time of a game like this
    00:07:19 AI real time planes flying as well based on real world flights!
    00:07:39 3D mapping fly by through cities capable?
    00:08:01 Recommended specs for MS Flight Sim
    00:08:52 They used 2PB of map data?!?
    00:09:06 You need a 20Mbit connection to the internet to play?
    00:09:21 One small problem?
    00:09:42 1080p Ultra - 50FPS? 2080Ti?!?
    00:10:02 4k 35FPS? 
    00:10:15 Guru3D.com breaks down framerates for different pc's
    00:10:44 30Fps at 1080p? Guess you need a GTX 1070 or better!
    00:11:36 Ebay.com time
    00:12:15 You need to speed at least $200 on a second hand GPU to get 1080p 30fps
    00:12:44 Linus is stoked to play MS Flight Sim 2020
    00:12:46 Jake talked linus into buying a flight sim motion chair
    00:12:53 Linus has never tried a good sim seat in his house
    00:13:26 Linus asks luke if he has gone horseback riding
    00:14:07 Linus knew Jake would try to buy the chair after so linus tells luke to try it before its gone
00:14:39 Whats the next topic?
    00:14:44 Quick pointers from luke about MS flight sim 2020
    00:14:50 Launcher has a very large download so some people are struggling to get refunds.
    00:15:12 Valve has responded with the term saying they know when you're playing it, not just downloading
    00:15:38 People have been realising late that the game size is very large
    00:16:10 Luke says: Its a dad game MS Flight sim 2020
    00:16:44 Don't scam your parents though
    00:17:00 If you spend enough time in flight simulator you could learn how to fly?
00:17:44 So much good stuff here
00:17:50 **Facebook'en'ing of OCULUS - TOPIC**
    00:18:18 OCULUS is set to remove support for their OCULUS accounts not linked to facebook in october
    00:18:36 All OCULUS must be switched to facebook before januray 1 2023 or their devices will only work in offline capacity?
    00:19:10 Because OCULUS is now attached to facebook, you can no longer create an alias to use. Your facebook name will be used.
    00:19:31 A new privacy policy is set to come to facebook
    00:19:44 Facebook locks mic from being used unless signed into facebook account
    00:19:57 No console or gaming service has never required the users social network to function
    00:20:32 VR Satisfaction has gone up as a whole because of lockdown most likely
    00:21:00 Luke recommends Index over OCULUS
    00:21:14 Linus Recommends VIVE Pro
    00:21:35 For a lot of people VR isn't about gaming
    00:22:09 People will create fake accounts
    00:22:52 Most consumers will think this has a terrible Privacy Policy
    00:22:09 Oculus by facebook can already track data
    00:23:40 Facebook buying OCULUS quote

    00:30:02 Facebook promised they would not force users to login with facebook
    00:31:40 Linus is surprised it took facebook this long

00:35:40 **Apple supplying parts to independant repair shops (not as cut and dried as you might think) - TOPIC**
    00:35:56 Apple announced expansion of its repairable items at independant repair shops
    00:36:15 Lewis Rossman points out pointed out some problems
    00:36:52 Linus has a rant about this
    00:37:09 List of parts is very restricted
    00:37:30 Digital content next asked apple to change 30% cut
    00:37:41 Apple accuses EPIC of planning ahead
    00:38:22 Linus isn't a fan of everything that EPIC is doing
    00:39:12 Unclear exactly why EPIC is doing this
    00:41:00 Why not mention google?
    00:41:28 Apple requires all the customer information with any parts order
    00:41:55 What is the point of taking on Apple?
    00:43:32 Maybe Apple doesn't like gaming?
    00:44:45 All just seem unecissary
    00:44:56 Google also takes 30% from gaming
    00:45:18 Fortnite was originally not on the play store.
    00:46:03 EPIC have statements saying they want to have their own store.
    00:46:49 EPIC wants to be alternative store?
    00:48:06 Why should EPIC worry about 30% cut?
00:48:45 Youtube takes 45%??!!
00:49:14 Linus has a ton of respect for Google/YouTube
00:49:43 YouTube does more than Apple comparatively
00:51:10 Why YouTube is amazing
00:51:56 Most people know these videos
00:52:21 Someone has to Subsidise YouTube
00:52:45 Number crunch time for next WAN SHOW

00:59:26 Untill DLSS2.0 Linus wasn't sold on new upscaling tech
    01:00:08 HDMI 2.1 On new XBOX

01:04:11 **BREAKING NEWS... The RTX 3090 has been pictured - TOPIC**
    01:04:50 Three Connectors??

    01:05:25 Linus confused about the reference cooler
    01:06:20 Linus thinks the card looks sexy AF
