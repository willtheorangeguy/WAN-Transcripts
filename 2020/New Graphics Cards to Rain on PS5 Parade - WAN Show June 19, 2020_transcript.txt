[0.00 --> 12.56]  and we are live welcome my friends to the when show we've got a spectacular show for you today
[12.56 --> 18.50]  which is uh how you can always tell that we definitely have nothing the more i try to hype
[18.50 --> 23.52]  it up at the beginning of the show the more it's probably it's probably just going to be me and luke
[23.52 --> 29.62]  bs-ing about playing civilization 6 the other night my uh my friends have called me my friends
[29.62 --> 33.16]  and high places have called me and they told me this is a great show it's a great show it's a great
[33.16 --> 40.06]  show and with great things in it first up we've got raspberry pi now with pci express expansion
[40.06 --> 45.56]  that's right you can install a pcie card in a ras pi as long as you're willing to like
[45.56 --> 54.90]  well we'll talk about it later but it ain't easy in other news boston dynamics is spot robot now on sale
[54.90 --> 61.74]  yes my friends for the low low price of just 74 500 us dollars you could buy yourself a boston
[61.74 --> 70.50]  dynamics robo dog what else we got there's a 3d nes emulator that was released on steam of of all
[70.50 --> 81.32]  things and uh amd confirms ryzen xt chips launches b550 chipset fun also in other news youtube's live
[81.32 --> 86.90]  streaming stuff is still hot garbage warning please check the video resolution the current
[86.90 --> 89.68]  resolution is 1920 by 1080 which is not optimal
[89.68 --> 100.72]  what are you talking about what's wrong with it that sounds perfectly optimal it sounds pretty
[100.72 --> 111.16]  fantastic just like this segue to our intro wow bang got it oh wow we went and put the ps5
[111.16 --> 116.02]  graphics card stuff in the title and thumbnail and then didn't even talk about it as a headline
[116.02 --> 121.30]  topic oops i was trying to remember what was in there yeah we'll talk about that first we'll talk
[121.30 --> 124.68]  about that first it's gonna be good it's gonna be good you'll like it the show today is brought to
[124.68 --> 138.32]  you by pulseway and displate why plate when you can displate oh my yes all right so the big news for pc
[138.32 --> 148.82]  gamers and quite honestly gamers in general is rtx 3090 3080 and titan specs leaked so the original
[148.82 --> 154.04]  article here is from well actually there's a lot of articles about it over on hot hardware wccf tech
[154.04 --> 163.12]  oc3d.net but basically what it looks like is nvidia is going to be shaking up their branding a little bit
[163.12 --> 170.88]  i'm going to go ahead and pull up the wccf tech article here and getting rid of ti and
[170.88 --> 177.62]  maybe super but probably not super because super is one of those things that kind of comes later maybe
[177.62 --> 183.10]  but it seems to be that nvidia has found consumers are having a hard time differentiating between what
[183.10 --> 191.42]  constitutes a ti and what constitutes a super and i should probably clarify i pronounce ti wrong
[191.42 --> 197.60]  according to nvidia according to them it is tie which i think is the stupidest thing ever because
[197.60 --> 209.68]  tie is spelt t-i-e both both like real world ties and fictional ties like tie fighters are spelled t-i-e
[209.68 --> 216.90]  so if you wanted to call it uh titanium i could get behind that you know you got your periodic table
[216.90 --> 223.76]  elements you got your symbol for titanium there you got a ti no problem get behind that absolutely
[223.76 --> 229.48]  but unless it's titanium which actually apparently it is that's that's what it's short for so i guess
[229.48 --> 234.28]  like tie is sort of like short for titanium okay there's a justification i just went and undid my
[234.28 --> 240.04]  own argument i still hate it it's ti and didn't you know all that already though yeah yeah i did i just
[240.04 --> 245.86]  forgot sometimes i know things but then i forget them it happens a lot and then sometimes i remember
[245.86 --> 250.54]  them while i'm in the middle of talking and then i realize i sound like an idiot i was like so ready
[250.54 --> 259.66]  to swoop in you just cut me off and countered your own argument yep i destroyed myself i'm tired of
[259.66 --> 265.16]  other people doing it you know it's like the the eight mile rap battle where you just like went after
[265.16 --> 270.72]  yourself before the other rapper could and just won because of that it's like oh no i have never seen
[270.72 --> 277.98]  it's actually well i haven't seen it since it came out but i liked it a lot when it came a long time
[277.98 --> 287.58]  ago all right so let's talk about the specs so according to the leaks the rtx 3080 so we would
[287.58 --> 293.40]  expect based on current generation pricing let's just have a quick look here we would expect that to
[293.40 --> 300.58]  come in around the sort of thousand dollar ish and low price point uh so you can get an rtx 2080 super
[300.58 --> 308.58]  for kind of 700 so that's us so that would be around 900 something canadian dollars somewhere in that
[308.58 --> 317.72]  neighborhood um so that is rumored to have the same number of cuda cores so 4352 as the 2080 ti
[317.72 --> 325.04]  and depending on how much they're able to ramp clock speeds up that could mean that for around 700 us
[325.04 --> 332.64]  dollars you could be looking at more like uh 1200 you know current gen performance that's not a bad
[332.64 --> 338.70]  little uplift that also assumes of course that nvidia doesn't go ahead and bring us this next generation
[338.70 --> 345.98]  of graphics card at higher performance and then proportionally higher prices i wouldn't put it past
[345.98 --> 353.60]  them the rtx 3090 so this sounds like the direct replacement for the 2080 ti will apparently have
[353.60 --> 362.04]  5248 cuda course that's about 20 more than the 2080 ti so a combination of clock speed improvements
[362.04 --> 367.70]  and architectural improvements should result in significantly better performance we're also
[367.70 --> 375.66]  looking at faster memory apparently gddr6x with a 384 bit bus for the 3090 and for full specs apparently
[375.66 --> 382.18]  i need to just take a look at the charts on one of the websites here not video cards because that
[382.18 --> 389.08]  one doesn't have a chart so why don't we try uh oc3d.net what do you think about them using 90
[389.08 --> 396.96]  i think it's lame because 90 used to mean dual gpu dual gpu yeah so we might have just boomered
[396.96 --> 403.16]  ourselves there a little bit yeah like okay boomer new 90 means whatever way to go idiot because they
[403.16 --> 407.42]  haven't done it in a while but no they haven't definitely meant dual gpu they haven't done it
[407.42 --> 417.80]  since the 690 and since then it's just been uh 80s and ti's and this is kind of uh it is kind of a
[417.80 --> 424.64]  bigger change than it might initially feel like because 8 has been associated with nvidia's high end
[424.64 --> 436.56]  for wow a very long time we can go all the way back to i think for g force 4000 series
[436.56 --> 443.90]  it topped out at 4600 just a quick heads up as well apparently youtube is dead for a bunch of people
[443.90 --> 449.34]  oh okay nothing i can do about that other than tell people hey why don't you go ahead and subscribe on
[449.34 --> 456.84]  float plane yes woo float plane you can also go watch on twitch for free uh all right hey got him
[456.84 --> 464.34]  okay so the last time nvidia didn't make it all the way to 8 i guess would have been like g force 4000
[464.34 --> 471.36]  series i think the 4600 ti was the top end then don't quote me on that this is like pre me being into
[471.36 --> 478.20]  like like hardcore gaming um and then they definitely had a high end for the 5000 series
[478.20 --> 487.38]  so the 5800 and then they refreshed that with a like like basically like overclocked variant the 5900
[487.38 --> 497.52]  ultra so that's the last time i remember them using a nine uh sort of suffix on a high-end single gpu card
[497.52 --> 507.92]  after that 6800 ultra was the top end then it was 70 uh oh no i lied there was a 7900 gtx
[508.88 --> 515.28]  okay so maybe nvidia's real problem here isn't that they're abandoning a long tradition but rather
[515.28 --> 520.64]  that they just have no idea what they're doing when it comes yes when it comes to naming their products
[520.64 --> 527.68]  they're just i will i will say i will say i think this is better do you if you ignore the past i think
[527.68 --> 534.88]  this is better and the 200 series had the 285 and then they just skipped 300 series there was i think
[534.88 --> 542.08]  well it wasn't 300 uh uh like it was like oh yeah my pc product yeah yeah like they rebranded some cheapo
[542.08 --> 548.80]  um to 200 series if i recall correctly yeah they were shoved it in some oem pcs and then moved on
[548.80 --> 553.20]  there might have been like a mobile thing or something like that it was just obviously purely
[553.20 --> 560.64]  branding um no no new actual technology yeah pulling up the yeah go ahead what do you think
[560.64 --> 565.84]  of the naming scheme though i find it i think it's less confusing for sure well it's gonna be more
[565.84 --> 570.96]  confusing for people that have been in this space but if you're if you're new and looking at cards it's
[570.96 --> 577.20]  more straightforward it's less confusing until they start like around with it because that's what happens
[577.20 --> 583.92]  every time the rtx the rtx lineup wasn't confusing until all of a sudden well okay it was a little
[583.92 --> 588.88]  confusing because they did away with gtx branding and brought in rtx but like i i guess it like kind
[588.88 --> 594.00]  of makes sense because okay it has ray tracing hardware on it fine fine fine fair enough sure but
[594.00 --> 599.12]  they brought in this rtx branding and everything was pretty clear so we had the oh man i'm trying to
[599.12 --> 604.48]  remember the cards they actually launched with don't quote me on it but the the kind of initial wave
[604.48 --> 611.28]  lineup right is your 2080 ti your 2080 or 2070 or 2060. and then if you go below that actually this
[611.28 --> 618.32]  was really confusing you had same generation turing gpu but then it dropped the rtx capabilities which
[618.32 --> 625.84]  meant that instead of being rtx 2000 it was gtx i think i think there might be some trademarking issues
[625.84 --> 630.80]  with this but i would have really preferred yeah if they did gtx dash r i think that would have looked
[630.80 --> 636.88]  super cool that would have been pretty sweet actually um so what do i think of the oh yeah
[636.88 --> 643.92]  right and and turing got even more confusing because now is it the 1650 or something like that
[643.92 --> 653.60]  that has either three or four different actual hardware variants or is it the 1660 i can't remember
[653.60 --> 660.64]  one of the one of the mid-tier cards has a number of different gpu configurations that you might actually
[660.64 --> 671.28]  end up getting um some new uh 1660 1660 ti 1660 super and there was a 1666 gig wasn't there
[672.80 --> 678.80]  um so i think there's the 1660 i'm going off the top of my head i could totally be wrong i think
[678.80 --> 687.84]  there's 1663 gig 1660 oh it's five gig someone says in chat yeah i can't remember what the rules are
[687.84 --> 691.52]  so i'm really sorry i'm not i'm not i'm just gonna stop saying stuff when i'm not sure
[692.48 --> 699.60]  i know that one of the mid-tier non-rtx cards there is a variety of different hardware configurations
[699.60 --> 707.84]  that you can get and that to me is as a techie really confusing but i guess as long as they tune
[707.84 --> 714.00]  the performance so it's about what you would expect for the number then i guess it doesn't matter
[714.00 --> 721.52]  except when it does because there was that rtx 2060 that was using the same gpu as the rtx 2070
[721.52 --> 726.72]  or was it the 2080 ah dang it now i can't remember that one either whatever it used a it used a
[726.72 --> 733.60]  different gpu a higher tier gpu um but then it sort of ended up being about the same in gaming but like
[733.60 --> 739.28]  much better for professional workloads and i was like um um okay what's going on things are getting
[739.28 --> 745.84]  really confused it was uh specifically the rtx 2060 ko from evga and it came in at this like super low
[745.84 --> 753.84]  price um yeah here we go it used tu104 instead of tu106 which is the gpu that you would expect to find
[753.84 --> 764.24]  in an initial one uh rtx 2060. so it's just it ends up being very very confusing and that particular one
[764.24 --> 771.76]  uh was clocked about the same uh same number of rops what did it end up having more of
[772.88 --> 781.12]  oh i cannot remember six gigs of memory uh they both do okay yeah the regular ko and the regular 20
[781.12 --> 787.20]  the ko and the regular 2060 both have the same amount of memory it's just uh the 2060 super got
[787.20 --> 793.36]  the eight gig upgrade if i recall correctly so yeah it's fine for now so we're probably gonna have like
[793.36 --> 803.84]  uh 20 so coming coming out of the gate we're gonna have a 2080 a 2090 or excuse me a 3080 and 3090
[803.84 --> 811.36]  and then uh some kind of like titan um and then probably they'll follow up with like a 3070 3060
[811.36 --> 817.76]  and then it'll get confusing when they start sort of saying oh well we've got some scrap 3070 gpus maybe
[817.76 --> 824.80]  we'll throw some of these in a 3060 and call it like a you know ko and then but going way back this
[824.80 --> 831.44]  has always been the case i remember one of the best gpu deals uh back when i was working in sales at ncix
[831.44 --> 842.24]  was the 7900 gto so this came around right before the 8000 series was due to uh launch
[842.24 --> 851.04]  and as far as we could tell it was basically nvidia dumping a bunch of remaining 7900 gtx's
[851.60 --> 859.44]  onto evga and it was like hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying a gtx even though the gtx was
[859.44 --> 865.92]  available at exactly the same time and the performance was nearly identical i remember this
[865.92 --> 871.92]  for sure it was pretty early on for me it was a super super weird card
[874.00 --> 880.00]  um apparently it did not support hdcp but then no i don't think any of the 7000 series is wow that's
[880.00 --> 884.96]  funny to think about things like that being issues like not being able to play back high def content i
[884.96 --> 895.44]  remember that huh recommended gaming resolution 1280 by 720 or 640 by 480. very nice so here we go
[895.44 --> 902.80]  i've got an ancient thread from september 2006 over on hard forum let's see if uh my yeah there it is
[902.80 --> 908.40]  look at that uh stolen from crazyhorse at sd.net blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and wave rates
[908.40 --> 916.00]  are priced to 260. remember when like a high-end like but value gpu was could be had for 260 dollars
[917.28 --> 922.32]  wow things uh things have really changed over the years haven't they so that's scaled a little bit
[922.32 --> 927.36]  faster than inflation on that one it had the same clock speed same number of pixel pipelines as the
[927.36 --> 934.96]  gtx but i think yeah the memory the memory might have been uh lower clocked and uh nvidia wasn't the
[934.96 --> 940.24]  only one who pulled this kind of stuff back in the back in the other back in the old days x800 gto
[940.24 --> 949.84]  squared i remember that thing that's funny well nobody seems to have it that was okay 512 megs uh with a
[949.84 --> 957.36]  7900 gtx cooler on it for 250 bucks yeah should blow away a 79 50 gt for 50 less like this thing
[957.36 --> 964.64]  was absolutely nuts i miss this kind of thing and you know like i get it you know a company like nvidia
[964.64 --> 970.08]  or evga for that matter like all these guys have probably gotten a lot slicker in terms of their
[970.08 --> 975.52]  supply chain management and sourcing and like not accidentally ending up with a whole bunch of gpus
[975.52 --> 979.76]  that they have to get rid of right before they launch new generation but it really did make
[979.76 --> 991.84]  things more fun it's true i just yeah i don't know i liked it when it was like basically impossible to
[991.84 --> 997.04]  keep track of everything and they just released like new stuff every like four to six months yeah well
[997.04 --> 1003.28]  that that uh that uh that ship sailed a long time ago it's gone you know what's crazy to think about
[1003.92 --> 1012.32]  is the rtx 2080 launch was i think it was somewhere between 18 months and two years ago
[1013.28 --> 1018.88]  give me a sec here i'm just gonna find it yeah november 2019 so that was
[1018.88 --> 1028.96]  2019 november wait a minute yeah that's wait that's not that bad uh wait no that can't be right
[1028.96 --> 1041.04]  no no no excuse me excuse me september 2018 that's so we are coming up on two years since the rtx 2000
[1041.04 --> 1048.80]  series launched and in that time the most mind-boggling thing to me about it is that amd has still not
[1048.80 --> 1055.20]  managed to put forward something that's competitive although you know what i'm gonna do it luke i'm
[1055.20 --> 1066.56]  doing it i'm having hope for the rdna2 based cards okay i've decided amd has been good enough to me
[1066.56 --> 1072.16]  over the last couple of years on the cpu side of things that i am ready to put myself out there again
[1072.72 --> 1076.64]  i'm ready are you gonna commit to put one in your personal what no
[1076.64 --> 1082.96]  but that i mean that's a stupid question i mean in much the same way i wouldn't commit to put
[1082.96 --> 1088.64]  nvidia's new graphics card in my system it could be an unstable mess i'm just i was just checking if
[1088.64 --> 1094.80]  it was if it was love or hope you know it's hope it's still definitely hope yeah it's it's hope and
[1094.80 --> 1097.52]  and you know i can i can love to be hopeful you know
[1097.52 --> 1109.04]  but uh no i'm not putting intel's new gpu in your gaming rig oh wow no with that said wow that's
[1109.04 --> 1114.08]  actually that's some newsworthy stuff right there that didn't make it into the dock today so mr the
[1114.08 --> 1122.32]  one and only ryan shroud uh over at intel actually had a demo running this is this is pretty cool uh i'm
[1122.32 --> 1129.44]  just gonna pull it up twitter right uh demo battlefield 5 yeah he definitely had it on
[1129.44 --> 1136.32]  twitter so he took a prototype tiger lake system for a spin in battlefield 5 with intel's i think
[1136.32 --> 1144.40]  we're supposed to say z xc gpu and he's running battlefield 5 on a thin and light notebooks check this
[1144.40 --> 1155.20]  out right here on high at 30 fps this is integrated graphics it is actually hey everybody ryan here
[1155.20 --> 1160.96]  and sometimes oh ryan thanks ryan you know what whatever let's just let's just today i'm playing
[1160.96 --> 1167.68]  with a prototype tiger lake notebook in preparation for later this year oh that's probably not making
[1167.68 --> 1174.56]  better i wish he didn't use twitter video i know like i'm not trying to be like at the high
[1174.56 --> 1179.84]  flow plane master race right now but like this looks horrible as you would expect for a game the
[1179.84 --> 1185.28]  the visuals are absolutely stunning like i'm sure if you're not watching on twitter at or above it looks
[1185.28 --> 1192.64]  terrible on a thin and light notebook using only integrated graphics and this is the type of uh
[1192.64 --> 1196.80]  performance and experience you'll be looking forward to seeing on tiger lake later
[1197.36 --> 1204.16]  integrated graphics in in very cool integrated graphics being actually genuinely usable for like
[1204.16 --> 1211.44]  relatively high-end games is is very nice yeah and the thing too is like even just aside from
[1211.44 --> 1217.44]  gaming integrated graphics being better is absolutely a good thing i actually shot a really fun video
[1217.44 --> 1222.88]  today um i i built linus's computer
[1222.88 --> 1230.40]  so like you know the other linus yeah yeah i don't know if you saw this he upgraded his system
[1230.40 --> 1238.64]  recently and uh i'm trying to remember wait what yeah he upgraded his system recently and you built it
[1238.64 --> 1244.96]  well i built the same one okay i was like how did i not hear about this but what was cool was he
[1244.96 --> 1252.08]  actually provided very detailed rationale behind all of his parts choices and the system is like
[1253.12 --> 1259.52]  shockingly well thought out and i don't mean that because like you know oh because he's probably a dumb guy
[1259.52 --> 1265.60]  or something like it's not like that it's just that people with other priorities don't always spend
[1265.60 --> 1273.20]  the time and care to go through and meticulously optimize a pc parts list they just have other
[1273.20 --> 1277.28]  things to do and they buy a dell and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that there's a reason that
[1277.68 --> 1282.08]  you know dell ships however many millions upon millions of computers a year um
[1282.08 --> 1289.20]  um so it was just it was a little surprising to me to see a software guy that probably only builds a
[1289.20 --> 1294.72]  system you know every year or every couple years or whatever like go through and like absolutely
[1294.72 --> 1301.36]  freaking nail all of the hardware choices i was like this is a great system it's like perfectly balanced
[1301.36 --> 1306.16]  for what he's doing and really well thought out and one of the things that he said was that he doesn't
[1306.16 --> 1312.64]  care about discrete graphics and quite honestly would actually just prefer to have onboard graphics
[1312.64 --> 1319.84]  as long as it has adequate feature support and performance and i was like oh yeah from like a
[1319.84 --> 1326.08]  system simplicity standpoint why wouldn't you just want the gpu right on the cpu fair enough how many
[1326.08 --> 1332.56]  monitors it's more elegant so he did end up putting a graphics card in this one um i have to i'm making
[1332.56 --> 1337.12]  guesses now but i have to assume that multi-monitor support would be a reason to do something like
[1337.12 --> 1343.28]  that uh he also went threadripper so having any monitors connected to it means that you're you're
[1343.28 --> 1351.28]  stuck with that of course he he could have gone intel um but i guess part of the problem is that
[1352.08 --> 1358.24]  amd on their on their high core count ryzen desktop cpus does not have integrated graphics so going amd
[1358.24 --> 1362.08]  wouldn't have been an option and going intel wouldn't have been an option because intel hasn't
[1362.08 --> 1369.12]  released anything that would be a compelling enough upgrade for him um that does have on board graphics
[1369.12 --> 1375.60]  anyway so he was already running a 9900k so thread ripro is the way to go and then he just ended up
[1375.60 --> 1382.96]  putting uh an rx 580 in it because it was just sort of like like a decent thing i guess to to put in i
[1382.96 --> 1385.28]  need to hook monitors into it whatever yeah
[1385.28 --> 1386.24]  yeah
[1388.32 --> 1390.64]  and there's no way he's gonna you know
[1392.48 --> 1402.88]  go nvidia yeah yeah yeah yeah i just would not have seen that one coming if you put an nvidia
[1402.88 --> 1408.00]  graphics card in the system have they have they mended fences at all i actually have not followed
[1408.00 --> 1412.24]  that that's as far as i know no i mean nvidia hasn't opened up their linux driver so
[1412.24 --> 1416.40]  i have to assume that the situation hasn't changed much
[1419.20 --> 1426.96]  why don't we jump into one of our other topics for the day raspberry pi now with pcr express expansion
[1426.96 --> 1434.32]  this is absolutely tremendous the article here is over on tom's hardware i am stoked look at this
[1434.32 --> 1443.44]  is this not actually so awesome is this not the cutest computer ever so oh my goodness you can't do
[1443.44 --> 1451.12]  it with the older raspis but with the raspberry pi 4 and with some soldering okay this is this is not
[1451.12 --> 1458.40]  a stock configuration here ladies and gentlemen you can actually take the pci express interface that
[1458.40 --> 1466.88]  would normally be used for the usb controller and you can just reroute it so you can you can get rid
[1466.88 --> 1475.52]  of your usb 3 controller and instead you can have a pci express expansion slot that you could then put
[1475.52 --> 1482.64]  a usb controller card into and it's only a six dollar chip that you need to sell no you would probably
[1482.64 --> 1488.96]  put in something else uh the example that they have here is a network card so you could put higher
[1488.96 --> 1497.44]  speed networking for example if you were using your as pi as a router or or something server or as a file
[1497.44 --> 1501.92]  server actually a file server would be a great example of why you would want two and a half gigabit
[1501.92 --> 1511.92]  networking and if that pcie interface is fast enough for a usb 3 um yeah usb 3 controller then it's
[1511.92 --> 1516.40]  definitely fast enough for two and a half gig networking now obviously the first thing that
[1516.40 --> 1523.76]  came to my mind is i want to put an rtx 2080 ti on it obviously obviously that's the first thing i wanted
[1523.76 --> 1531.52]  to do unfortunately the developer of this little hack acknowledges uh where is it
[1531.52 --> 1542.72]  that you guys should make like the world's smallest yet still large like plex server or something
[1544.08 --> 1552.16]  um and have it in like a tiny little box with the network expansion card that's kind of like a massive
[1553.04 --> 1558.00]  uh i'm assuming this is sd card storage but they have huge sd cards these days
[1558.00 --> 1562.56]  so you get like a massive sd card a network expansion card
[1564.88 --> 1569.68]  huh could be pretty sweet that's not a bad idea i think we'd probably go something a little more
[1569.68 --> 1575.36]  powerful than a raspi just so you can actually you know uh have a little bit more flexibility in your
[1575.36 --> 1580.40]  real-time transcoding but that's that's kind of a cool idea it could be kind of sweet if you
[1580.40 --> 1588.08]  if you work as a like tech youtuber writer at one point maybe maybe uh it could be kind of cool like
[1588.08 --> 1591.84]  because a lot of people have those networking cabinets these days yeah there's like white
[1591.84 --> 1595.04]  ones that sit in the wall so if you could like fit it in there
[1595.04 --> 1604.00]  that would be very cool so this is from the tom's our tom's hardware article uh unfortunately graphics
[1604.00 --> 1611.28]  cards will not work because the cpu does not have enough bar space for them um and when i tried to
[1611.28 --> 1616.64]  find out exactly what they meant by bar space i ended up with a lot of results about space bars so
[1616.64 --> 1623.76]  uh given that i don't want to you know drink beverages outside of earth's you know atmosphere
[1624.48 --> 1631.76]  i um i'm gonna need you guys to pitch in in chat to let me know address register is commonly called bars
[1631.76 --> 1640.08]  hey there we go all right that's uh yep my my google my google search uh history definitely
[1640.08 --> 1648.48]  thinks i really need to know what the space bar does uh yeah so that's on that's unfortunate that
[1648.48 --> 1654.16]  would be super cool but hey two and a half gig or five gigamit networking is also pretty sweet you could
[1654.16 --> 1660.24]  also attach an ssd or a flash card that goes directly to the pcie bus that is that is sweet
[1661.60 --> 1665.84]  totally nerdy um the kind of thing that most people probably wouldn't bother to do just because
[1665.84 --> 1669.84]  it does involve soldering but it's the kind of thing where the cost of the parts is low
[1669.84 --> 1676.56]  enough that it's not even that stupid of a thing to do on a weekend you know yeah and like if you
[1676.56 --> 1684.56]  screw it up it's probably okay all right luke i know you couldn't wait for this tell us all about
[1684.56 --> 1687.12]  amd's confirmed ryzen xt chips
[1689.76 --> 1694.72]  is this like the fourth time we've talked about these or something it's definitely at least the third
[1694.72 --> 1701.52]  it's gonna it's gotta be up there after much speculation by us and other people
[1701.52 --> 1709.28]  amd has finally revealed the new ryzen xt chips and what they will look like ryzen 5 3600 xt will be
[1709.28 --> 1719.20]  249 dollars six core 12 threads at 3.8 gigahertz base 4.5 gigahertz boost 95 watts ryzen 7 3800 xt
[1719.20 --> 1728.48]  399 399 8 core 16 threads 3.9 gigahertz base 4.7 excited that's actually a pretty nice like
[1729.12 --> 1736.32]  price point for an 8 core sure is isn't it that ryzen 7 i think is is pretty sweet i suspect we'll
[1736.32 --> 1746.08]  see some of those move uh ryzen 9 3900 xt 499 12 cores 24 threads 3.8 gigahertz base 4.7 gigahertz boost 105 watts
[1746.08 --> 1752.88]  uh the 7 and the 9 don't come with a cooler the 5 comes with a wraith spire i'm actually okay with
[1752.88 --> 1761.68]  that do you think it matters that they include a cooler on a high-end cpu like that no i like that
[1761.68 --> 1769.76]  they include it on the 5 um yeah the 7 if you're if you're spending 400 before tax on a processor like
[1769.76 --> 1775.60]  get a cooler for it yeah i don't think it's that much to ask no especially when you factor in that
[1775.60 --> 1782.24]  buying a cpu cooler that is really you know like good enough to run that cpu um at a really nice
[1782.24 --> 1788.32]  low temperature give it a nice long life is not that expensive like you know hyper 212 is in that
[1788.32 --> 1797.28]  35 dollar range 40 range i don't think it's a lot to ask to spend 10 of your cpu cost on decent cooling
[1797.28 --> 1805.36]  for it we're still using hyper 212s uh there's a bunch of variants of it cooler master it's hilarious
[1805.36 --> 1811.04]  because uh the reason that i was looking at this the other day but they can't um we did a video
[1811.04 --> 1815.84]  about it's not actually up yet but we did a video about what it actually takes to cool intel's 10th
[1815.84 --> 1822.40]  gen cpus because and rightly so we took some criticism in our launch review for not disclosing
[1822.40 --> 1827.92]  the cooler we were using when we said hey we got good thermal results um and we were like okay
[1827.92 --> 1834.88]  that's a fair point it was a total accident it just wasn't put on the slide um unfortunately but it's
[1834.88 --> 1839.84]  one of those things where people that are looking for looking to find fault will say hey that's you
[1839.84 --> 1845.92]  know it's it was malice rather than stupidity but i'm pleading stupidity here uh anyway the point is
[1845.92 --> 1852.72]  um we decided to take that criticism and go one step further and actually take five different coolers
[1852.72 --> 1861.04]  at different price point okay yeah did you show anything by any chance i think i might be uh i think
[1861.04 --> 1869.20]  i might be live again give it a second okay that's very weird what's happening here
[1869.20 --> 1889.12]  uh that's very strange what's happening right now uh let me see uh obs is is super confused
[1889.12 --> 1897.84]  uh yeah obs is wait
[1901.28 --> 1902.32]  is obs back
[1904.48 --> 1907.36]  hold on a second let me pop you out
[1908.88 --> 1915.92]  uh huh that's very weird what's happening here wait i think float plane's back
[1915.92 --> 1926.40]  uh uh uh uh uh lagging like crazy it's kind of frozen you are very clear to me now and your voice
[1926.40 --> 1934.64]  is working perfectly to me now yeah okay uh just so you know that's fun improving okay uh you look
[1934.64 --> 1941.52]  good on twitch maybe i just need to refresh for full clean obs is crying again i'm just trying to add you
[1941.52 --> 1946.48]  as a source and it's it's having a hard time it's struggling perfect
[1948.56 --> 1953.28]  uh that's weird because i'm expecting it to freeze and it hasn't done it
[1955.20 --> 1964.40]  full plane is working well okay oh twitch froze uh hold on there's still time
[1964.40 --> 1976.00]  there's still time to fix this we can still fix this luke i believe okay so i'm gonna put you right
[1976.00 --> 1985.12]  there and then i'm uh i'm uh put a little uh oh man is it transform or filter can never remember edit
[1985.12 --> 1997.60]  transform um um crop left 600 uh oh it froze it froze up again
[2000.80 --> 2010.16]  this is this is i don't know i don't know what this looks like uh but 600 crop left was definitely too
[2010.16 --> 2018.48]  much so let's take another crack let's take another crack at that transform edit transform let's try like
[2018.48 --> 2027.76]  300. okay let's move put you right there oh no a little bit less wow this is something
[2029.04 --> 2034.24]  edit transform uh maybe like 370. okay
[2034.24 --> 2043.76]  weird thing is that my utilization cpu memory disk network gpu i'm not even using gpu encoding so
[2044.80 --> 2053.20]  it's all low everything's under like 10 percent obs is just having a significant freak out here
[2055.92 --> 2063.36]  it's very odd yeah yeah super odd super odd very unfortunate i think we are live again though and
[2063.36 --> 2072.88]  it's actually working now uh but uh okay okay i'm not 100 sure not so much no it that is not a thing
[2072.88 --> 2079.20]  that i am certain about at this point in time throughout this entire thing obs doesn't think it has dropped
[2079.20 --> 2090.88]  a single frame well maybe uh maybe it didn't you know obs is like the input like i can see my call with you
[2090.88 --> 2100.00]  is completely fluid but obs is frozen right now like you're frozen in obs and so am i so both inputs are
[2100.00 --> 2100.40]  frozen
[2102.80 --> 2111.44]  and now we're back uh so i'm just watching the i'm watching the stream here to see what happens when obs was
[2111.44 --> 2119.52]  frozen there yep it's just freezing for no apparent reason whatsoever so that's really cute
[2120.88 --> 2133.04]  and uh really frustrating nothing i can really do to help um yeah no not at all do you want me to try
[2133.04 --> 2142.40]  to pick it up from here i'm also really worried about what's going on with the youtube stream i feel like
[2142.40 --> 2151.52]  that video might have like ended uh because i i can't find the live dashboard just trying to remember
[2151.52 --> 2158.24]  because it's under like go live so if i'm live right now does it take me to the one that's live right
[2158.24 --> 2165.60]  now okay i can click on it apparently i'm apparently we're still live all right ladies and gentlemen
[2165.60 --> 2175.60]  i i guess we're just i guess we're going for it here i think we're going for it um uh it's definitely still freezing
[2177.28 --> 2184.96]  it seems a little better right i mean i can't tell online it's not technically offline
[2185.52 --> 2189.12]  no no it's frozen yeah it froze again playing again on twitch
[2192.00 --> 2192.72]  this is great
[2196.16 --> 2204.88]  i just have no idea what's going on right now yeah it's something
[2210.32 --> 2214.72]  i mean is it safe to assume this is something to do with my computer
[2214.72 --> 2228.72]  uh that's very weird okay did it did it get the wrinkles out of its system are we good i'm still
[2228.72 --> 2241.28]  seeing what yeah twitch is frozen right now is it i wonder why i have i have no way of knowing why luke
[2241.28 --> 2246.08]  it's not going to be a good idea why do they still have audio even when i'm even when i'm going
[2246.96 --> 2252.56]  will the rowers keep on rowing i can't tell apparently apparently there's still audio
[2252.56 --> 2262.00]  the audio is fine no signs of slowing okay you know what screw it let's do it let's finish off the
[2262.00 --> 2269.92]  show who even care forward yeah yeah all right so let's talk about these new chips the new xt processors
[2269.92 --> 2275.28]  um will be drop in compatible with any motherboard that is currently compatible with verizon third gen
[2275.28 --> 2280.40]  processors and to go along with the launch i mean i guess that makes sense they're just like a little
[2280.40 --> 2290.64]  faster um and ooh boost clocks are not only a little bit higher but also residency at these boost
[2290.64 --> 2294.48]  clocks is far better than the original release thanks to improvements in the manufacturing process
[2294.48 --> 2300.80]  so that's sick amd is also announcing that store my version 2.0 will release along with the new cpus
[2300.80 --> 2305.92]  utilizing a read-only caching approach rather than a tiered storage approach then it's been rebuilt from
[2305.92 --> 2310.56]  the ground up that's probably a safer way to do it so store my was a licensed version of an modus's
[2310.56 --> 2317.68]  fuse drive software and 2.0 will support any combination of any capacity hard drives and ssds emphasis has
[2317.68 --> 2322.96]  been placed on ease of setup and use which is a really positive thing because ease of setup was not
[2322.96 --> 2333.84]  a strong point for store my v1 maybe i'm going to go ahead and talk through our sponsors real quick
[2333.84 --> 2339.12]  here to make sure that uh even if the show is terrible we at least still get paid for putting it
[2339.12 --> 2346.48]  on the show is brought to you today by hey displate uh displate is the magnetic mounted metal print that
[2346.48 --> 2351.76]  goes on your wall dis plates are durable and you don't need any power tools to hang one they've got over
[2351.76 --> 2357.20]  800 000 different art spanning a bunch of different styles and influences they plant a tree for every
[2357.20 --> 2362.40]  displate that gets purchased and we've even got our own line of displates you can go to displate.com
[2362.40 --> 2369.44]  linus tech tips and if you use our link and use offer code when you can save 15 today okay my talking
[2369.44 --> 2374.24]  points say when my lower third says ltt i'm not going to stress out too much about it because i definitely
[2374.24 --> 2380.88]  have bigger problems at the moment like the show is also brought to you by pulseway that's what i really
[2380.88 --> 2385.52]  need i need pulseway monitoring all my stuff so that i know what the heck is going on here
[2385.52 --> 2389.04]  pulseway is a real-time remote monitoring and management software that allows you to manage
[2389.04 --> 2393.84]  systems and support users from anywhere you can fix problems on the go by sending commands from any
[2393.84 --> 2398.40]  mobile device it's compatible with windows mac and linux and pulseway's single app gives you remote
[2398.40 --> 2403.28]  desktop functionality so you can well have remote desktop functionality real-time status system
[2403.28 --> 2408.40]  resources logged in users network performance you can manage windows updates you can do so much with it
[2408.40 --> 2414.64]  so scan install and update your systems on the go at pulseway.com we're gonna have that linked in
[2414.64 --> 2421.92]  the video description all right so we don't have our like lower third so that i feel kind of naked
[2421.92 --> 2426.72]  without it it's actually kind of weird but that's okay we can do the rest of the show naked
[2428.24 --> 2433.92]  not totally naked twitch won't allow it but other than that naked yes all right why don't you pick a
[2433.92 --> 2437.84]  topic if you don't like cpu topics watch him pick a cpu topic
[2444.80 --> 2452.72]  uh-oh if he's talking to me right now i can't hear him can you hear me now i can that was my bad uh
[2453.36 --> 2460.32]  my topic which is the best topic out of all of them is that lttstore.com has four elemental shirts for 50
[2460.32 --> 2468.88]  bucks straight up that's it yep our least the topic our least popular shirt design ever is back
[2470.08 --> 2479.84]  you're welcome uh let's see and where is it yep there it is so we got rid of the two least popular designs
[2480.40 --> 2487.60]  uh so are the two least popular colors and we're focused on the slightly more popular colors and then
[2487.60 --> 2495.36]  we've added two new ones so there's white purple hey there it is red so that's one of the original
[2495.36 --> 2501.04]  ones look at this beardless guy here what a freak and orange now that's a glorious beard
[2503.20 --> 2508.16]  also not bad so uh really we don't expect anyone to buy these things
[2508.16 --> 2517.76]  just like you know individually at full price but but it's a pretty good deal at 50 us dollars for four
[2517.76 --> 2523.52]  of them it's like cheaper than a shirt you can get anywhere else pretty much and it looks cool
[2524.48 --> 2531.60]  and it's comfortable and nice material yes they're super comfy like it's actually a really good shirt
[2531.60 --> 2544.80]  and it's 12.50 that's crazy um so yeah good topic good topic good topic outside of that um yeah pick a
[2544.80 --> 2553.52]  real topic loop i guess i have to my phone is freaking out can you stop please uh boston dynamics spot is now
[2553.52 --> 2560.48]  on sale we were talking uh before the show started uh about whether or not you would potentially buy one
[2561.28 --> 2571.44]  oh man oh i have a hard time even i have a hard time even coming up with what the right price would be
[2571.44 --> 2579.12]  for me because you could you could mount a wi-fi router to it uh that connects to no that doesn't
[2579.12 --> 2584.80]  make any sense that's boring no i want to see like some some cool project you could do with it
[2585.52 --> 2590.48]  yeah i want to see some cool project that i could do with it i just don't know i just don't know what
[2590.48 --> 2598.80]  it would be so here i'm on i'm on the site here uh let's just oh obs is frozen so i can't really move
[2598.80 --> 2604.88]  around on the site unfortunately but basically they've got three different versions the explorer
[2604.88 --> 2611.84]  enterprise and academic um as far as i can tell it's pretty much going to be the same product
[2611.84 --> 2615.68]  they just want you to contact them if you're an enterprise user or an academic user
[2616.24 --> 2627.04]  uh and here is this working now no okay how about this no how about this no stop oh wow obs please stop
[2627.04 --> 2635.60]  there we go okay there's the top of top of my page now so oh my god i am so unhappy right now
[2635.60 --> 2643.68]  with what's going on okay so as long as you don't want more than i think it's two uh from the article
[2643.68 --> 2647.68]  that i read although it's letting me add like five of them to cart maybe it's just going to tell me hey
[2647.68 --> 2652.00]  you should probably contact us if you want more than a few of them you're supposed to contact them
[2652.00 --> 2660.08]  um but yeah the the famous robot from all of the viral videos is now actually available to buy
[2660.64 --> 2669.28]  and what they i think expect people to do with them is things like um surveying areas where it's not
[2669.28 --> 2676.96]  safe to send humans or completing totally monotonous tasks like if you have to uh you know take the same
[2676.96 --> 2683.20]  picture of the same thing 50 times a day because you're trying to track if it's being used properly
[2683.20 --> 2691.28]  or or something in your warehouse um a spot is a a great alternative to having a person go and do
[2691.28 --> 2699.04]  those stupid tasks have you seen the cost of their add-ons no i haven't check out just the battery
[2699.76 --> 2704.00]  how much is a spot battery oh wow who do they think they are red digital cinema
[2704.00 --> 2711.28]  spot care service plan providing one year of extended coverage and expedited repair is 15 grand
[2711.84 --> 2718.88]  an additional battery for your spot and it only runs for oh man how long was it specs here we go
[2719.60 --> 2726.32]  uh average run time with no payload is about 90 minutes with 180 minutes of standby time so if you
[2726.32 --> 2732.80]  want another battery you're going to need to spend 4 600 us dollars an additional charger 1600 bucks
[2732.80 --> 2743.92]  the ports wow regulated power and ethernet that's it 1275 bucks i don't know about you but i think
[2743.92 --> 2749.44]  i think 21 800 for awareness for a robot is actually very reasonable
[2750.80 --> 2758.08]  so that's an inspection and lidar all of those things together is so much wow
[2758.08 --> 2768.40]  wow edge gpu spot core ai provides advanced processing for applications requiring on robot
[2768.40 --> 2778.16]  computation wow that's pretty cool see that's the problem with this thing though is i wouldn't know
[2778.16 --> 2785.60]  the first thing to do with it like yeah if we were just doing a video for the memes and i was just um
[2785.60 --> 2792.72]  um you know making a video where i'm i i just tell it hey follow me around the office all day lol
[2793.76 --> 2799.04]  yeah that'd be hilarious or whatever and it would get views on youtube but i don't feel like we'd really
[2799.04 --> 2805.60]  be adding anything meaningful to the conversation so i don't really want to spend 75 000 just to
[2806.40 --> 2811.36]  do something like that also by the way they even tell you exactly what components
[2811.36 --> 2820.88]  are built into this edge gpu so you get um two gigabit ethernet ports uh a handful of usb ports type
[2820.88 --> 2828.24]  c and type a you get mini pcie and it's occupied with an lte modem in some configurations and you get
[2828.24 --> 2837.76]  a xeon e3 processor and an nvidia quadro p5000 gpu and this too can be yours for just 24 500 us dollars
[2837.76 --> 2844.64]  wow i mean i get it they have no competition as far as i can tell yeah like there's other robots
[2845.20 --> 2852.24]  they did stuff to it like they didn't just throw a bunch of parts in a no black box no um no it's
[2852.24 --> 2858.64]  like got ingress protection winter snow and summer rain but still cool itself and like all this other
[2858.64 --> 2866.16]  cool stuff but holy what would you do with a spot i don't know
[2868.24 --> 2876.48]  like that's for a run with a really weird looking dog i mean that's cool yeah like it's super cool
[2877.60 --> 2882.72]  kind of but it's not worth 75 000 yeah but then we're not we're not the customers for it right so
[2882.72 --> 2890.08]  yeah i don't know what's the max speed of it terrain horizontal field of view collision avoidance
[2890.08 --> 2896.08]  maintain set distance from stationary objects i'd like to use it to bring something with me
[2896.64 --> 2903.84]  on a difficult hike that i wouldn't be able to just like carry myself i don't think this is gonna do it
[2903.84 --> 2910.88]  for you i think it would be cool but i also don't know like what i would want it to bring with me maybe
[2910.88 --> 2918.32]  explore chernobyl also at like 5.6 kilometers per hour like you're going for a walk luke you're not
[2918.32 --> 2924.80]  going for a run here you're going for a brisk difficult hike yeah yeah but that's also at speed
[2924.80 --> 2934.00]  on level ground so oh fair yeah it can apparently have a 30 degree incline though that's yeah like i've
[2934.00 --> 2940.80]  seen it climb stuff i just would want to like play with it like if i could if i could just
[2940.80 --> 2946.40]  you know buy it and return is that worth it is that demo it to play with the future
[2949.20 --> 2956.00]  no of course not okay 75 000 luke are you nuts yeah like i don't mean for for you or for me i mean like
[2958.64 --> 2966.00]  i mean i would click on that video yeah for sure but like the entire line of tech tips this is too
[2966.00 --> 2974.24]  long of a title the entire line of tech tips crew tries to find a use for a 75 000 dog i mean this is
[2974.24 --> 2982.56]  the kind of thing where you know if we had the okay if i was if i was some combination of like hacksmith
[2983.76 --> 2993.12]  wendell myself and probably half a dozen other highly skilled mechanically or programming inclined you know
[2993.12 --> 3002.56]  people um you know i would love to do an entire series just doing yeah weird stuff with it like if
[3002.56 --> 3008.64]  like if you know hacksmith could build an arm for the top of it and then you know we had some really
[3008.64 --> 3017.52]  skilled ai programmer put together um you know some kind of machine vision thing sorry the arm is coming
[3017.52 --> 3022.56]  in 2021. well i mean we'd want to do it before the official one wouldn't we so you know if there's
[3022.56 --> 3027.36]  like if we could put an arm on it and program it to recognize a ball and go get it and we like actually
[3027.36 --> 3032.16]  go to a park and play fetch with a robotic dog like that is some that is some 20 million views stuff right
[3032.16 --> 3039.84]  there you know like sure but that is also the kind of thing that i would actually have to have
[3040.48 --> 3051.20]  like a boston robotics team skill level staff to to implement like it's non-trivial is all i'm trying
[3051.20 --> 3057.20]  to say michael reeves it'll if you pair with michael reeves it'll almost kill you in the process but
[3057.20 --> 3066.80]  it'll be super awesome um i love that guy some people are like mkbhd will have one just get it like no
[3066.80 --> 3074.40]  that's not a reason to buy a 75 75 000 toy i want to send it to colorware and get it all matte blacked
[3074.40 --> 3083.28]  out and then make him really jealous is that worth it no it's 75 000 like you're talking to the guy who
[3083.28 --> 3092.00]  didn't air condition his house for 10 years because it cost money like um if so okay i tell you what if
[3092.00 --> 3098.00]  somebody sends a 75 000 super chat i promise to spend it on the robot i don't think you can even
[3098.00 --> 3104.72]  do that honestly don't don't do that because youtube would get like 20 30 of it or whatever
[3104.72 --> 3110.48]  that would be really stupid yeah so buy 75 000 worth of elements shirts
[3112.80 --> 3120.64]  that's the worst advice you've ever given then you can donate the shirts even though the world has way
[3120.64 --> 3126.40]  too much clothes and donated clothes are being wasted because there's too much to give away because
[3126.40 --> 3134.96]  of the the uh uh crazy over consumerist culture that is around clothing but you can donate the clothes
[3136.88 --> 3143.04]  and lannis will buy a spot you know that would be 600 000 shirts right like we work with a local printer
[3143.04 --> 3150.48]  he could not make 600 000 shirts hiring people right now is probably great there's a lot of people
[3150.48 --> 3157.76]  out of work this is awesome i i can totally imagine a shirt printing facility that is that is covid safe
[3157.76 --> 3164.56]  uh this is you're just honestly you're donating shirts you're getting lannis to buy a spot you're helping
[3164.56 --> 3172.80]  small business so you see it as a win win win win win absolutely yeah oh man we've got super chats
[3172.80 --> 3180.24]  or you just have shirts for the rest of your life which is also kind of cool mike man 997 super chats
[3180.24 --> 3186.40]  moving gaming rig with spot okay mobile gaming redefining mobile gaming there's your title there's
[3186.40 --> 3193.76]  your like clickbait title mobile gaming like you've never seen it before this thing like toe what is there
[3193.76 --> 3199.76]  is there information on that i think it does have a payload uh payload capacity here payloads yep
[3199.76 --> 3206.08]  maximum weight of 30 pounds uh 14 kilos wait isn't that like 14 kilos 30 pounds
[3208.40 --> 3215.04]  is it 14 kilograms too i mean these are very smart yeah okay never mind 30.1 so almost 31.
[3216.72 --> 3221.36]  is that what it can tow though or is that what it can carry because those should be different things
[3221.36 --> 3228.56]  for 3.9 so almost 31. sorry uh hard to say i suspect that's what it could carry i don't know if it would
[3228.56 --> 3234.64]  be designed to tow something like that's a very different force on it right yeah it is yeah it
[3234.64 --> 3239.84]  absolutely is and it probably wouldn't be very good at it due to the yeah and depending how the thing was
[3239.84 --> 3249.20]  hitched to it right like a um a towed payload can put like very uneven force on the thing that's that's uh
[3249.20 --> 3257.52]  that's hauling it unless you are observing measuring or manipulating i don't see it really
[3257.52 --> 3263.04]  having a use so you'd have to i think you'd have to do one of those things did you pull that right
[3263.04 --> 3269.68]  off their site no observing measuring or manipulating what what made you say that oh i see what else are
[3269.68 --> 3273.68]  you really going to do it's not going to carry very much the only thing it's probably going to carry
[3273.68 --> 3280.16]  is the things that you use to observe measure or manipulate it's not towing really adam savage made
[3280.16 --> 3288.80]  it to himself that's hilarious um maybe it can tow i guess it's not really fast so like you gotta i
[3288.80 --> 3293.20]  think you gotta find something that it could it's expensive so you wouldn't want to deploy it in any
[3293.20 --> 3298.24]  kind of like security application because like that would be something pretty cool like instead of
[3298.24 --> 3303.60]  having to hire a security guard which is you know like fifty thousand dollars a year or whatever you
[3304.16 --> 3310.96]  buy one of these and that's it you know you just put like a camera on it you hopefully it's smart
[3310.96 --> 3317.92]  enough to just go plant itself on its charger and then like you know do another patrol right but then
[3317.92 --> 3322.56]  if someone just walks up and like grabs it like knocks it over and like grabs it like what are you
[3322.56 --> 3332.08]  gonna do about it right you could track it uh yeah i i guess so i like to think that someone's savvy
[3332.08 --> 3339.84]  enough to like steal your robot dog is probably savvy enough to like put it in a fairy cage a dog yeah i
[3339.84 --> 3346.08]  i don't know unintentionally do that yeah it's it's walking out in the open and it looks like a robot dog
[3346.08 --> 3355.04]  i could see many a petty thief go oh expensive looking robot take not really think too much about it
[3356.16 --> 3365.92]  people steal phones yeah that's true okay fair point and you'd need like the awareness module which is
[3366.48 --> 3368.80]  21 800 yeah
[3368.80 --> 3376.72]  yeah potentially the inspection module but i think just the awareness this thing is so cool like this
[3376.72 --> 3384.00]  is exactly what you know something like jibo needed to be like i would love it if boston robotics got
[3384.00 --> 3389.36]  their hands on that kind of like natural movement technology that those guys were working oh my god
[3389.36 --> 3397.92]  that's what you can do put a jibo on top of it no no no no no no work with probably anthony do some do
[3397.92 --> 3405.76]  some home automation scripting with this thing home automation because it could traverse your home
[3406.48 --> 3413.28]  see like actually go do things for you see light switch spot turn light switch off spot and he could
[3413.28 --> 3419.76]  like go press it once the arm comes out you could have it go like open the fridge and bring you a drink
[3422.64 --> 3425.36]  like home butler level automation
[3427.92 --> 3434.64]  i mean it would know it wouldn't work well enough to actually like be practical it might work well
[3434.64 --> 3446.00]  enough to do it enough for like a video video yeah so got it it's not worth 75 000 luke plus how much
[3446.00 --> 3453.28]  do you think that six degrees of freedom arm is gonna cost so much so much so very much
[3453.28 --> 3468.48]  i'm out i'm out i'm out go do taxes spot go do taxes oh in other news uh intel releases gen 2 optane
[3468.48 --> 3474.00]  and new 3d nand ssds i'm actually pretty excited about next generation optane oh my god
[3474.00 --> 3480.24]  so pick up the roomba and put it on another floor someone just said in the chat that brain that does
[3480.24 --> 3486.24]  sound useful actually like that home automation spot that's what it makes to finally make a roomba
[3486.24 --> 3490.56]  actually useful and actually less work than just going and getting a vacuum and like running
[3491.68 --> 3496.88]  just anytime the roomba just screws up the spot could go like go put it back on its dock
[3496.88 --> 3508.48]  this is awesome home automation spot okay it's gonna be like 140 000 home automation robot back to
[3508.48 --> 3513.92]  back to second generation optane okay so these are persistent memory module dims they're starting in
[3513.92 --> 3518.64]  an enterprise and then hopefully they'll work their way down to our enter consumer grade hardware
[3518.64 --> 3530.64]  eventually um the last generation 256 gig optane dim had a 360 petabytes written rating and we get 38
[3530.64 --> 3536.00]  more endurance this generation so 497 petabytes written that's pretty cool there's no real increases
[3536.00 --> 3544.08]  in capacity so it's 128 256 and 512 but if intel can get the price right and we actually are hoping to
[3544.08 --> 3550.00]  do a video on this pretty soon like using these gigantic capacity optane dims to supplement your
[3550.00 --> 3555.12]  system memory if they can get the price right they could potentially displace d-ram for large-scale
[3555.12 --> 3560.80]  fast memory which would be a big win for them because they need a good story on the server side of things
[3560.80 --> 3569.76]  because cpu performance and pci express uh expansion and bandwidth is not really it right now in the face of
[3569.76 --> 3577.52]  what amd is doing with their epic processors here's a new new question because i'm still stuck on this
[3577.52 --> 3584.80]  and i realize i'm derailing hard but what if there was a tournament what are you talking about spot again
[3585.44 --> 3594.00]  yeah oh man what kind of tournament would you would you pit the uh inventiveness and ingenuity
[3594.00 --> 3604.32]  like the lioness tech tips team in a robot spot battle tournament against other youtube teams
[3607.92 --> 3616.24]  it could even be like multi-disciplinary so there there could be like the fight maybe that's at the end
[3616.24 --> 3623.36]  yeah i would think so there could be other like tasks or or things that you'd have to compete like
[3623.36 --> 3633.60]  it could be a whole just to be clear are you talking about dog fighting oh geez wow wow luke oh no
[3634.64 --> 3641.60]  you heard it here first guys luke thinks that we should have a multi-disciplinary dog fight tournament
[3641.60 --> 3649.68]  oh you disgust me i absolutely obvious only when it's robots even then the robots are going to kill
[3649.68 --> 3657.60]  me first now you walked right into that robots all i have to say is humans fight each other for fun
[3658.40 --> 3663.52]  and it's all consensual and stuff and i guess you wouldn't be consenting because you're a robot so
[3663.52 --> 3669.84]  maybe i'm still evil i'm sorry i apologize all right brandon stubbs has a super chat here
[3670.56 --> 3675.92]  just claim as a business expense all right i have definitely talked about this on the
[3675.92 --> 3682.72]  wan show before but it merits mentioning again because a lot of people still seem to think that
[3683.28 --> 3691.04]  expensing something or writing something off as a business expense is some kind of magic wand that makes
[3691.04 --> 3699.04]  the money not actually cost you anything you mean it isn't that is not how it works
[3699.84 --> 3706.56]  that's not how it works at all you still have to earn that money you just don't get taxed
[3707.12 --> 3714.32]  on the money that you spent because you effectively didn't make it as profit so if linus media group
[3714.32 --> 3726.56]  incorporated were to have let's say have a hundred thousand dollars of of revenue come in okay we have to pay corporate income tax on that revenue right which is i think in
[3726.56 --> 3741.28]  canada around 25 percent um so we got to pay corporate income tax okay so if we buy something for a hundred thousand dollars we don't have to pay that income tax because we didn't make that money
[3741.28 --> 3752.00]  but we still have to earn it even if we decide to spend it also and you still spend it you just don't spend you don't uh lose the tax
[3752.00 --> 3770.00]  yeah exactly so anyway another thing to factor in is that anything that expensive is going to count as an asset which means that you don't even get to write off depending on your regional rules you don't even necessarily get to write off the entire amount right off the bat
[3770.00 --> 3784.00]  so i would only be able to expense uh probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 to 25 of that right out of the gate so of my 100 000 here are my options
[3784.00 --> 3800.00]  options i can just not spend it on a robot and i get to keep 75 000 for you know um new equipment at the office or uh renovations or uh you know cool
[3800.00 --> 3808.00]  who even has costumes or whatever okay so 75 000 that i could just spend on other things for the business
[3808.00 --> 3812.00]  oh actually no no no sorry i'm doing this wrong i would have a hundred thousand dollars that i could just
[3812.00 --> 3821.60]  spend on other business expenses i could have 75 000 of profit or or i could buy the robot okay and then i would
[3821.60 --> 3832.16]  have only 25 000 to spend on other things i would have about 18 000 of profit and i would have a robot also
[3832.16 --> 3839.12]  i would have a giant tax liability because i would have to pay 80 percent of the tax on 75 000 so give me
[3839.12 --> 3854.48]  a second here 75 000 hold on calculator okay so 75 000 times 0.25 wait wait times 0.8 so i would actually owe
[3855.04 --> 3862.72]  15 000 in taxes on money i never made because i have this stupid asset that i don't need
[3864.64 --> 3871.68]  so what you're telling me is you're gonna get a robot no i'm not telling you that i'm telling you
[3871.68 --> 3878.40]  that writing things off does not magically make them not cost money and in fact this ends up costing me more
[3878.40 --> 3885.60]  because i have to pay taxes on money that i didn't even make and now to be clear i do get to amortize
[3885.60 --> 3890.40]  it over a number of years so by the time we're nine years down the road i will have gotten back
[3891.60 --> 3898.16]  about 97 and a half percent or something of those uh of the um
[3901.36 --> 3906.56]  so i get to use it as a deduction on my future taxes so i'll have gotten back some of that tax that i
[3906.56 --> 3914.16]  paid on money i never made but remember too that time equals money right that's an equation that
[3914.16 --> 3920.48]  is actually i'm fairly sure it's provable and having money earlier is kind of like having like
[3920.48 --> 3926.32]  more money is kind of like more time and more time is kind of like more money okay so if time
[3926.32 --> 3933.60]  equals money then more time equals more money so if i don't spend that money stupidly today and have
[3933.60 --> 3940.80]  to pay taxes on that money that i stupidly spent today then i can invest that money today and i get
[3940.80 --> 3949.52]  an extra however many years to make that money grow over time instead of a robot that will definitely be
[3949.52 --> 3959.76]  a depreciating asset so there's many many reasons why i shouldn't buy the robot dog even if i was like
[3959.76 --> 3965.52]  you know i had 75 000 burning a hole in my pocket it's still a bad idea
[3967.84 --> 3977.28]  so you're done bud but robot track meet youtuber competition robot dog fight so so many views
[3978.40 --> 3983.36]  all right so many views is someone's gonna do it is there anything else in the doc that we wanted to
[3983.36 --> 3994.00]  talk about today um hey square enix is back on geforce now that's cool if you're into geforce now
[3994.00 --> 4000.48]  i have a gaming computer i'm not but you might be so that's cool uh 3d ness emulator released on steam
[4000.48 --> 4008.32]  wait what list of supported 3d sen which began in 2015 as a theoretical fantasy project has finally
[4008.32 --> 4016.00]  been released for sale on steam the emulator translates sprites and tile maps into voxels
[4016.00 --> 4021.68]  and creates a 3d play area out of the screen complete with the ability to swap out the
[4021.68 --> 4027.44]  background color i have not seen this but there's a vr version the current list of supported runs is
[4027.44 --> 4032.48]  limited but expanding okay no i have to see this authors here hold on here we go boys
[4032.48 --> 4041.52]  what the crap i linked you uh am i even looking at here okay hold on a second i'm bringing up my
[4041.52 --> 4045.68]  browser here everyone hopefully obs will unstream for long enough for you guys to check this out
[4047.12 --> 4051.44]  this is absolute madness pretty much
[4051.44 --> 4060.24]  i am my mind is blown a hundred percent blown
[4062.88 --> 4064.08]  i love it so much
[4068.64 --> 4069.60]  is it um
[4072.24 --> 4073.04]  what is it called
[4076.08 --> 4076.48]  wow
[4076.48 --> 4091.92]  3d send so 3d send vr which there is a free demo for is 22.79 and 3d sent this is canadian
[4091.92 --> 4094.80]  3d send pc is 10.34
[4097.28 --> 4102.56]  there's no way i don't spend 10 on this like i don't even like i don't even like nest wasn't really
[4102.56 --> 4109.44]  my childhood snes was me neither so i like it's not a huge deal for me from that perspective this
[4109.44 --> 4115.60]  is just the kind of amazing cool crap that just someone needs to make sure they buy so that
[4116.56 --> 4123.20]  cool crap like this continues to to get made i just cannot stop looking at this gameplay
[4123.20 --> 4135.76]  oh wow okay hold on a second this oh oh wow this this zelda man this is crazy
[4137.04 --> 4143.04]  i love it i'm still stuck on this 3d mario bros 3 thing that i sent you where's the zelda one i guess
[4143.04 --> 4147.60]  you're probably showing the stream that's unreal yeah i'm gonna try in a second here yeah there we go
[4147.60 --> 4150.80]  unbelievable
[4157.60 --> 4162.40]  all right all right okay i can stop staring at it now we should do a couple super chats or something
