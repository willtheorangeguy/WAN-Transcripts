[0.00 --> 4.20]  Going live. You're live.
[4.20 --> 7.40]  Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[7.40 --> 13.00]  Of course, my Google account uses exactly this moment to sign me out.
[13.00 --> 15.20]  I love it so much.
[15.20 --> 17.20]  We've got a great show for you guys today,
[17.20 --> 20.40]  but I don't know what any of the topics are because I got signed out of the dark.
[20.40 --> 22.00]  Luke, you want to run us through them?
[22.00 --> 26.40]  Yeah, I gotcha. Switzerland halts rollout of 5G over health concerns.
[26.40 --> 27.40]  Interesting.
[27.40 --> 32.80]  HTC shows off Project Photon next-gen AR headset design.
[32.80 --> 35.00]  We just had a light go out.
[35.00 --> 36.00]  Finally got this.
[36.00 --> 38.00]  It's very romantic in here now.
[38.00 --> 40.20]  You know what? No, leave it. Leave it.
[40.20 --> 41.80]  We're liking the ambiance.
[41.80 --> 44.80]  Cars as a service is here.
[44.80 --> 48.40]  I told you. I told you.
[48.40 --> 51.20]  Nissan vehicle subscription is coming.
[51.20 --> 55.20]  And PCI Express 6.0 first draft completed.
[55.20 --> 57.60]  Wow. On track for 2021.
[57.60 --> 58.60]  PCI Express 6.0.
[58.60 --> 59.60]  Whoa.
[59.60 --> 60.60]  Take that, Intel.
[60.60 --> 62.60]  Still on 3.0.
[62.60 --> 64.80]  Maybe they're just going to skip 4.0 at this point?
[64.80 --> 65.80]  Maybe. That'd be interesting.
[65.80 --> 66.80]  All right.
[66.80 --> 68.80]  So, oh, I guess I should roll the intro.
[68.80 --> 69.80]  That's the four topics.
[69.80 --> 70.60]  Let's do it.
[70.60 --> 71.60]  Well, there's more than four topics.
[71.60 --> 72.60]  No.
[72.60 --> 73.60]  And, well, we have to...
[73.60 --> 74.60]  Only four.
[74.60 --> 75.20]  Only four.
[75.20 --> 77.00]  No, we have to talk about...
[77.00 --> 79.00]  We have to talk about Matrix 4.
[79.00 --> 80.00]  Oh.
[80.00 --> 82.00]  Does that count as a topic?
[82.00 --> 85.00]  It doesn't even count as a movie.
[85.00 --> 87.40]  Wow.
[87.40 --> 92.40]  Someone just posted in the chat.
[92.40 --> 93.40]  First time during the chat.
[93.40 --> 95.40]  How are you guys?
[95.40 --> 97.40]  It's just like...
[97.40 --> 98.40]  Spadda!
[98.40 --> 99.40]  For days.
[99.40 --> 114.80]  Welcome to our chat.
[114.80 --> 123.80]  I guess you mostly hang around in, like, the smaller chats where you can have a conversation.
[123.80 --> 124.80]  Like, actually functions as a...
[124.80 --> 129.70]  You know, I was talking to YouTube about the, um, premieres feature.
[129.70 --> 133.20]  And they were like, yeah, we've got tons of creators that absolutely love it.
[133.20 --> 134.70]  Do you know what that feature is?
[134.70 --> 135.70]  Yeah.
[135.70 --> 136.70]  Yeah.
[136.70 --> 139.70]  So, for those of you not familiar, it's the one where instead of just publishing a VOD,
[139.70 --> 146.90]  a new video goes live using the same kind of mechanism as their live stream, and then
[146.90 --> 149.00]  gets published as a VOD shortly after.
[149.00 --> 153.50]  So, you get this notification, like, five minutes, ten minutes before it goes.
[153.50 --> 157.80]  And then the idea is that everybody is watching it at the same time, watching exactly the
[157.80 --> 159.56]  same moment of the video.
[159.56 --> 162.40]  And then as soon as the video is over, you can just go back and you can watch it as a
[162.40 --> 163.50]  normal VOD.
[163.50 --> 165.80]  And they were like, yeah, we've got, like, tons of great feedback about it.
[165.80 --> 166.80]  I'm like, oh, yeah?
[166.80 --> 167.80]  From who?
[167.80 --> 168.80]  Yeah.
[168.80 --> 173.80]  And they're like, oh, well, mostly smaller creators where their chat isn't just, like,
[173.80 --> 177.80]  a cesspool of people being confused about what premieres is.
[177.80 --> 179.80]  Because that was all ours ever was.
[179.80 --> 182.30]  Well, and is it still terrible for views?
[182.30 --> 183.30]  Um...
[183.30 --> 187.00]  Like, that's, I've seen a very large amount of content coming out about, like, anytime
[187.00 --> 189.10]  I launch premiere, that video does terribly.
[189.10 --> 190.90]  No, I haven't, I haven't seen that.
[190.90 --> 191.90]  I'm not sure.
[191.90 --> 192.90]  Yeah.
[192.90 --> 198.60]  I mean, I think that in the, in the age of video on demand being just a given.
[198.60 --> 199.60]  Yeah.
[199.60 --> 200.60]  Um...
[200.60 --> 205.60]  It's hard to force people to come and watch something at a given moment.
[205.60 --> 208.30]  Even if they would only have to wait six minutes...
[208.30 --> 210.00]  I think if it was some...
[210.00 --> 211.00]  ...to go back and see the beginning of it.
[211.00 --> 212.00]  ...to go back and see the beginning of it.
[212.00 --> 213.00]  I think if it was some...
[213.00 --> 214.10]  ...giant production or, like, a new music video or something like that...
[214.10 --> 215.10]  Yeah.
[215.10 --> 216.10]  ...you might be able to pull it off.
[216.10 --> 218.90]  But, like, YouTuber content?
[218.90 --> 221.60]  I just think people aren't in that mindset.
[221.60 --> 222.60]  Seems less like that.
[222.60 --> 224.60]  I think it's really tough to get past that friction.
[224.60 --> 229.10]  I was, you know what, I was, uh, I ended up in one of those, like, stupid clickbait listicles
[229.10 --> 229.60]  yesterday.
[229.60 --> 233.60]  Um, and it was, like, memes that only 90s kids will get or something like that.
[233.60 --> 234.60]  You clicked on one of those?
[234.60 --> 235.60]  I know, right?
[235.60 --> 237.60]  It was actually glorious, though, because...
[237.60 --> 238.60]  Okay.
[238.60 --> 245.80]  Um, there, one of them was, like, when I was a kid, uh, when you missed a TV show, that was it.
[245.80 --> 246.80]  You missed it.
[246.80 --> 247.80]  Forever.
[247.80 --> 250.80]  It's like, oh, yeah!
[250.80 --> 253.80]  I mean, I never really scheduled my life around TV.
[253.80 --> 254.80]  Me neither.
[254.80 --> 264.30]  I never really, like, I don't know if I've ever specifically gone out of my way to see the, like, the first, the premiere episode of something, you know, on network television.
[264.30 --> 265.30]  Ever.
[265.30 --> 266.30]  I can't think of ever doing that.
[266.30 --> 268.30]  And I didn't have a VCR either.
[268.30 --> 271.30]  I just, like, my life wasn't really TV oriented.
[271.30 --> 272.30]  Yeah.
[272.30 --> 273.30]  It was more video gamey.
[273.30 --> 274.30]  Yeah.
[274.30 --> 277.30]  Um, and one of the things I liked about video games was they were just there and you played them when you wanted to play them.
[277.30 --> 279.30]  I definitely, I waited in line for video games.
[279.30 --> 280.30]  That happened.
[280.30 --> 281.30]  I never, never waited for a TV show.
[281.30 --> 282.30]  I waited in line twice.
[282.30 --> 283.30]  For, what, what, oh.
[283.30 --> 284.30]  For the Wii.
[284.30 --> 285.30]  Oh.
[285.30 --> 286.30]  Yeah.
[286.30 --> 288.30]  So technically Wii Sports, if I was to say it was for a game.
[288.30 --> 289.30]  Yeah.
[289.30 --> 290.30]  Hey, Wii Sports is a good game.
[290.30 --> 291.30]  That's a good game.
[291.30 --> 292.30]  Yeah, I agree.
[292.30 --> 293.30]  Don't laugh at Wii Sports.
[293.30 --> 294.30]  I completely agree.
[294.30 --> 295.30]  It's an excellent game.
[295.30 --> 296.30]  All right.
[296.30 --> 298.30]  Let's move into the WAN show game.
[298.30 --> 300.30]  So our first topic of the day.
[300.30 --> 301.30]  Yes.
[301.30 --> 302.30]  I was right.
[302.30 --> 303.30]  Cars as a service.
[303.30 --> 309.30]  Now, with that said, some of the things that people were saying that I was wrong about are not actually addressed here.
[309.30 --> 310.30]  Yes.
[310.30 --> 315.30]  But, Nissan has introduced their vehicle subscription.
[315.30 --> 317.30]  Cars as a service is here.
[317.30 --> 326.30]  So Nissan Switch will allow a user to drive a wide variety of vehicles on a month to month basis with no long term agreements or contract required.
[326.30 --> 329.30]  So no loans, no leases, and no maintenance.
[329.30 --> 333.30]  And this is how they get you because that sounds awesome.
[333.30 --> 334.30]  Yep.
[334.30 --> 341.30]  I'm not going to own my car, which makes me very uncomfortable, especially because, oh, were you following the news?
[341.30 --> 344.30]  Car2Go, I think, is the one that just pulled out of Vancouver.
[344.30 --> 345.30]  Oh, really?
[345.30 --> 346.30]  Yeah.
[346.30 --> 350.30]  So Vancouver has a couple of those car sharing app companies in it.
[350.30 --> 353.30]  And I think the total fleet was around 6,500 cars.
[353.30 --> 356.30]  And then the biggest one just pulled out.
[356.30 --> 360.30]  They're going to take their whole fleet of 3,500 cars out of the market with them.
[360.30 --> 365.30]  And then the biggest competitor is like, we're going to bring in 500 more cars to fill the gap.
[365.30 --> 367.30]  And it's like, that doesn't fill the gap.
[367.30 --> 368.30]  That doesn't sound like it.
[368.30 --> 369.30]  At all.
[369.30 --> 374.30]  And so the city of Vancouver, which has some pretty aggressive environmental climate change reduction,
[374.30 --> 382.30]  targets or whatever is like, oh, wow, this actually kind of sucks because I think it was something ridiculous.
[382.30 --> 388.30]  Like 35% or 45% of people in Vancouver used these cars.
[388.30 --> 390.30]  I don't use them because I live out in the burbs.
[390.30 --> 392.30]  Yeah, it wouldn't make any sense here.
[392.30 --> 393.30]  You need to own your own car.
[393.30 --> 395.30]  That's just the way that it is.
[395.30 --> 402.30]  Because our transit system here is abominable anywhere outside of the city core.
[402.30 --> 406.30]  But anyway, I was floored by how many people used them.
[406.30 --> 408.30]  And then, yeah, so that's who this is gone.
[408.30 --> 412.30]  I know people in Vancouver that don't own a car and actively use Car2Go.
[412.30 --> 416.30]  They don't have to use it that often because they can usually bike or walk wherever they need to get.
[416.30 --> 419.30]  I know people who own a car and still use it from time to time.
[419.30 --> 424.30]  So David, for example, when we were going on a trip, he used a Car2Go to drive to the airport.
[424.30 --> 425.30]  Because it was cheaper than a cab.
[425.30 --> 426.30]  Oh, and you just leave it there.
[426.30 --> 428.30]  Because he drives himself and you just leave it there.
[428.30 --> 429.30]  That makes sense.
[429.30 --> 430.30]  Yeah.
[430.30 --> 431.30]  That's pretty smart.
[431.30 --> 432.30]  Big brain.
[432.30 --> 433.30]  I was like, that's brilliant.
[433.30 --> 434.30]  Exactly.
[434.30 --> 435.30]  Thank you for that.
[435.30 --> 436.30]  No worries.
[436.30 --> 439.30]  I needed to get my daily meme quota.
[439.30 --> 446.30]  So anyway, it makes me deeply uncomfortable because now all of a sudden people who have structured their lives,
[446.30 --> 450.30]  which these are like real decisions you're making about your life when you're like,
[450.30 --> 456.30]  okay, I am not going to own a car and I'm going to rely on these car sharing services,
[456.30 --> 463.30]  are now abruptly put into a lurch where either they need to reshuffle their finances to figure out how to get a car.
[463.30 --> 464.30]  Yeah.
[464.30 --> 470.30]  Or they're at risk of not being able to get to work on time or not being able to get their groceries conveniently
[470.30 --> 473.30]  or they'll have to pay a lot more for a cab or whatever the case may be.
[473.30 --> 474.30]  Fortunately, we have Uber now.
[474.30 --> 475.30]  So that's one helping hand.
[475.30 --> 477.30]  But in some places.
[477.30 --> 480.30]  It's much more expensive, of course.
[480.30 --> 482.30]  What were you going to say, Sari?
[482.30 --> 483.30]  It's just also not everywhere.
[483.30 --> 486.30]  But that's where competition is going to be helpful.
[486.30 --> 490.30]  Like if a bunch of companies did this, that would somewhat solve that problem.
[490.30 --> 494.30]  And if there was more competition than just Car2Go, that would somewhat solve that problem.
[494.30 --> 495.30]  You know what?
[495.30 --> 497.30]  Buy, buy, you know what?
[497.30 --> 498.30]  No, I don't buy it.
[498.30 --> 499.30]  Okay.
[499.30 --> 500.30]  I don't think competition is going to help at all.
[500.30 --> 501.30]  Why?
[501.30 --> 506.30]  How much did competition help us with online movie streaming?
[506.30 --> 507.30]  That's the, that's the...
[507.30 --> 509.30]  Has Netflix lowered their pricing?
[509.30 --> 511.30]  That's the opposite though.
[511.30 --> 518.30]  Because if you, the, the, the problem that you raised was like, I'm just going to attach this to movie streaming, which doesn't seem as important, but sure.
[518.30 --> 521.30]  Like you need your movies.
[521.30 --> 524.30]  You have to watch your movies to make it to the next day.
[524.30 --> 527.30]  And Netflix closes down.
[527.30 --> 529.30]  It's not like you can't get movies.
[529.30 --> 531.30]  There's many other options.
[531.30 --> 535.30]  Oh, I thought you meant competition from like a pricing standpoint.
[535.30 --> 536.30]  No.
[536.30 --> 537.30]  Okay.
[537.30 --> 538.30]  Cause, oh, okay.
[538.30 --> 542.30]  Cause you were talking about like, you, you have to make major financial changes in your life.
[542.30 --> 543.30]  Yes.
[543.30 --> 546.30]  Well, no, because there's probably a similarly priced other service.
[546.30 --> 547.30]  Okay.
[547.30 --> 548.30]  Yes.
[548.30 --> 549.30]  You're right.
[549.30 --> 550.30]  And that will help.
[550.30 --> 559.30]  But I, I think that in terms of pricing, if anything, I think everyone involved in this business is going to be trying to extract more value from it for a very long time.
[559.30 --> 560.30]  Yeah.
[560.30 --> 563.30]  And they'll probably like shake hands and all charge the same thing pretty much.
[563.30 --> 565.30]  Which is technically illegal.
[565.30 --> 566.30]  But they'll probably do it anyways.
[566.30 --> 569.30]  But they'll, well, it's not, sometimes it's not even a matter of shaking hands.
[569.30 --> 571.30]  So going back to when I was working at the computer store.
[571.30 --> 573.30]  You just look at what other people are doing.
[573.30 --> 574.30]  Yeah.
[574.30 --> 578.30]  We kept very, a very close eye on what others were doing in terms of pricing.
[578.30 --> 584.30]  And even though I never would, you know, talk to a product manager over at Memory Express.
[584.30 --> 588.30]  I mean, that's the thing about the internet is I can just go on their website and find out what their pricing.
[588.30 --> 593.30]  I remember back when I was doing like remote IT for people, like high school-ish range.
[593.30 --> 602.30]  I went and fixed a laptop for a lady who her whole job was to pay attention to gas stations in like her general area.
[602.30 --> 604.30]  And then call her gas stations.
[604.30 --> 605.30]  I don't remember what company she worked for.
[605.30 --> 606.30]  Yeah.
[606.30 --> 607.30]  It doesn't matter.
[607.30 --> 609.30]  And make sure they all updated their pricing.
[609.30 --> 610.30]  That was her whole job.
[610.30 --> 611.30]  Yeah.
[611.30 --> 612.30]  And she was like very successful.
[612.30 --> 613.30]  I was like, okay.
[613.30 --> 618.30]  And with computer, and with computer components, for example, it was very easy to discern what their pricing strategy was.
[618.30 --> 619.30]  Yeah.
[619.30 --> 623.30]  Because all you need to do is take a cross section of like a dozen different models of hard drive in different ways.
[623.30 --> 628.30]  And then they're going to go to different price bands and go, okay, so at the very high end, they're taking about seven and a half points margin.
[628.30 --> 634.30]  At the very low end, they're keeping those costs very low to try and get those low end system builders to come in, buy their hard drive for their computer,
[634.30 --> 639.30]  and then, you know, grab a CPU motherboard, give you some cables, high margin stuff.
[639.30 --> 640.30]  Okay, sure.
[640.30 --> 643.30]  So we're going to, you know, we're going to target the high end customers.
[643.30 --> 645.30]  We're going to go slimmer on the high end stuff.
[645.30 --> 648.30]  And we're not going to worry so much about shifting $40 hard drives day in, day out.
[648.30 --> 650.30]  And that'll be our strategy.
[650.30 --> 660.30]  So it's very easy to react and anticipate a competitor's pricing when you're just like a reseller or you're selling a service or whatever the case may be.
[660.30 --> 661.30]  Yeah.
[661.30 --> 662.30]  And everything's available online.
[662.30 --> 666.30]  Let's talk a little bit more about what the Nissan vehicle subscription looks like though.
[666.30 --> 669.30]  So you can switch cars, which sounds pretty cool.
[669.30 --> 673.30]  And if you're a supported in the supported region, here's how it works.
[673.30 --> 675.30]  Right now, it's just Houston, Texas.
[675.30 --> 680.30]  So you sign up for switch, download the app and select your use case and your vehicle model.
[680.30 --> 681.30]  Interesting.
[681.30 --> 687.30]  So a concierge will deliver a car to you within the select service area.
[687.30 --> 692.30]  And for now, that is apparently a 20 mile radius around the South main neighborhood in Houston.
[692.30 --> 694.30]  It's very clearly just a test.
[694.30 --> 695.30]  Oh yeah.
[695.30 --> 702.30]  If you decide you don't like the vehicle that was delivered to you, you can switch it out for another one at any time with no limits.
[702.30 --> 703.30]  Yeah.
[703.30 --> 709.30]  There's no charge and your concierge will help you transfer luggage, groceries and other objects from vehicle to vehicle.
[709.30 --> 711.30]  Okay, two tiers.
[711.30 --> 713.30]  So there's select and premium.
[713.30 --> 714.30]  Why does select mean cheap?
[714.30 --> 715.30]  I have no idea.
[715.30 --> 720.30]  Because select used to mean like good, like in produce, you know?
[720.30 --> 721.30]  Anyway.
[721.30 --> 726.30]  Isn't there a grocery chain around here that their brand is called select?
[726.30 --> 727.30]  I think there used to be.
[727.30 --> 728.30]  Yeah.
[728.30 --> 729.30]  Maybe not anymore.
[729.30 --> 730.30]  I can't remember.
[730.30 --> 731.30]  But I remember that being a thing.
[731.30 --> 732.30]  Was that like the cola at Safeway or something?
[732.30 --> 733.30]  Maybe.
[733.30 --> 734.30]  Select?
[734.30 --> 735.30]  Maybe.
[735.30 --> 736.30]  Superstore or something?
[736.30 --> 746.30]  All I remember is I have never consumed an off-brand cola since this one time that I drank like one of them.
[746.30 --> 747.30]  Like I didn't even have a ton.
[747.30 --> 753.30]  I drank one of them before I drive down the Sea to Sky Highway from Whistler, which is about a two hour drive.
[753.30 --> 761.30]  There was an accident and we were stuck sitting on the highway for I kid you not like two and a half, three hours.
[761.30 --> 769.30]  And I peed myself not once, not twice, but like at least four times.
[769.30 --> 770.30]  Now fortunately my-
[770.30 --> 772.30]  Why did you get out of the car?
[772.30 --> 775.30]  Because there were, you're on the Sea to Sky Highway.
[775.30 --> 776.30]  There's a cliff here.
[776.30 --> 777.30]  Okay.
[777.30 --> 779.30]  There's a drop off here.
[779.30 --> 780.30]  It pissed off the cliff.
[780.30 --> 782.30]  There's a drop off here and there were like cars on either side.
[782.30 --> 785.30]  Like there was no, there was no privacy or anything.
[785.30 --> 786.30]  Look, I was like eight.
[786.30 --> 787.30]  Okay.
[787.30 --> 788.30]  I was a kid.
[788.30 --> 792.30]  Fortunately my dad's car had leather seats at the time.
[792.30 --> 798.30]  So at least there was no lasting damage, but that was a very unpleasant and wet.
[798.30 --> 800.30]  So now you don't buy off-brand cola.
[800.30 --> 803.30]  Well, so some things have diuretic properties.
[803.30 --> 804.30]  Sure.
[804.30 --> 806.30]  And I have never had that experience.
[806.30 --> 809.30]  Like, like the way it hit me, like a ton of bricks.
[809.30 --> 816.30]  I have never experienced having to pee that suddenly and that badly before or since in my life.
[816.30 --> 820.30]  And it was like, it was some like, I think it was select-
[820.30 --> 821.30]  Select.
[821.30 --> 822.30]  Cola or something like that.
[822.30 --> 824.30]  Anyway, I will never, I will never drink off-brand.
[824.30 --> 829.30]  I actually don't really drink pop anymore anyway, but I will never drink off-brand cola in my life.
[829.30 --> 830.30]  So anyway.
[830.30 --> 837.30]  I don't drink pop that often anymore either, but back in the day I was, I was quite the consumer of off-brand cola.
[837.30 --> 838.30]  I'll say that much.
[838.30 --> 841.30]  Because you could get a two liter for like 95 cents.
[841.30 --> 844.30]  But doesn't it bother you that you smell bad?
[844.30 --> 845.30]  Smell bad?
[845.30 --> 846.30]  No.
[846.30 --> 848.30]  Well, if you're peeing yourself all the time.
[848.30 --> 849.30]  Oh, gee.
[849.30 --> 850.30]  I didn't do that.
[850.30 --> 853.30]  I was like, no dog, I got that gamer bladder.
[853.30 --> 855.30]  Yeah, pretty much.
[855.30 --> 857.30]  Dude, I pee once a day.
[857.30 --> 858.30]  Kidding.
[858.30 --> 861.30]  Okay, so my biggest thing with this, select is-
[861.30 --> 862.30]  Hold on, I haven't talked about pricing.
[862.30 --> 864.30]  Okay, you tell them about the pricing.
[864.30 --> 869.30]  Select is $699 with a one-time $495 activation fee.
[869.30 --> 880.30]  Premium is $899, which moves you to the Nissan Leaf, Maxima, Murano, Armada, Titan, and 370Z, or Z, whatever.
[880.30 --> 886.30]  And the option to drive a GTR for an additional $100 a day.
[886.30 --> 887.30]  My biggest thing with this-
[887.30 --> 889.30]  No more than seven days at a time though.
[889.30 --> 891.30]  I guess they've just got like two.
[891.30 --> 892.30]  Yeah.
[892.30 --> 893.30]  Okay.
[893.30 --> 894.30]  Take the GTR for very long.
[894.30 --> 896.30]  It's not cheap.
[896.30 --> 897.30]  No.
[897.30 --> 898.30]  And-
[898.30 --> 899.30]  It's like pretty expensive.
[899.30 --> 911.30]  And you're limited to 2,000 miles of driving or 180 days of general usage for each individual vehicle, whichever comes first, and then you have to switch.
[911.30 --> 912.30]  Weird.
[912.30 --> 913.30]  Yeah.
[913.30 --> 917.30]  So you're subject to all these odd terms and conditions.
[917.30 --> 919.30]  So you like have to change your car.
[919.30 --> 921.30]  But you can change your car.
[921.30 --> 923.30]  And you know, this is something really interesting.
[923.30 --> 932.30]  So when we were buying a minivan and we went to the dealer, I was trying to negotiate on one of the used ones before we ended up eventually settling on a new one.
[932.30 --> 935.30]  I think I remember telling you why I ended up buying a new vehicle.
[935.30 --> 936.30]  Yeah, because I was really surprised.
[936.30 --> 942.30]  Yeah, because the minivan is the first vehicle that either I or my wife has ever purchased new in our lives.
[942.30 --> 943.30]  Yeah.
[943.30 --> 957.30]  And the reason for it was that we basically came up with this whole formula for how much the vehicle was costing, whether it was a used one or a new one, per unit of remaining lifetime.
[957.30 --> 969.30]  So we operated under the assumption that for a gasoline powered minivan, 200,000 kilometers, so it's like what, 150,000, 160,000 miles or 140,000 miles, whatever.
[969.30 --> 971.30]  If you could convert that for me, that would be great.
[971.30 --> 979.30]  200,000 kilometers is about the trouble-free, hassle-free service life of a vehicle before you can expect-
[979.30 --> 980.30]  120,000.
[980.30 --> 987.30]  Yeah, 25,000 miles before you can expect, okay, it's going to be time to start doing, you know, a new transmission, new, you know, power steering.
[987.30 --> 994.30]  Like, start to replace larger items that will start to affect your total monthly cost of ownership.
[994.30 --> 995.30]  And your ability to use the vehicle.
[995.30 --> 997.30]  And your ability to use the vehicle.
[997.30 --> 1006.30]  The thing is, when you've got small children, sometimes it's not about how much does this cost me, sometimes it's about what situation does this put me in.
[1006.30 --> 1018.30]  We're on a family road trip, we are in the middle of some mountain pass, and I have a bunch of kids aged 6 to 12 that are mad, and I'm like, my life doesn't need that experience, you know what I mean?
[1018.30 --> 1020.30]  So we operated under that assumption.
[1020.30 --> 1022.30]  Or that's how you bond as a family.
[1022.30 --> 1023.30]  No, it isn't.
[1023.30 --> 1026.30]  So there's a 200,000 kilometer sort of lifetime.
[1026.30 --> 1035.30]  And then what we did was we took every listing for a minivan on Craigslist, Kijiji, at dealerships, and we basically applied this formula.
[1035.30 --> 1047.30]  And we looked at a cost per remaining lifespan.
[1047.30 --> 1059.30]  And what we ended up with was a value of, I think it was about $7 or $8 per kilometer, or per 10 kilometers, whatever, whatever the ratio was.
[1059.30 --> 1060.30]  Okay.
[1060.30 --> 1066.30]  But it was about a 7 1⁄2 to 8 1⁄2 for anything that was about 10 years old.
[1066.30 --> 1071.30]  And then it was in the neighborhood of 9 1⁄2 to 11 for brand new.
[1071.30 --> 1078.30]  And then it was actually in the neighborhood of around 10 to 12 1⁄2 for lightly used.
[1078.30 --> 1079.30]  Kind of in between.
[1079.30 --> 1080.30]  Yeah.
[1080.30 --> 1081.30]  So no, it was higher.
[1081.30 --> 1084.30]  No, I was saying for the category that's in between.
[1084.30 --> 1085.30]  Yeah.
[1085.30 --> 1093.30]  So for anything that was still the current platform, before you're going back to, yeah, that was a significantly older platform that car was built on.
[1093.30 --> 1094.30]  Yeah.
[1094.30 --> 1103.30]  And so what we realized was that given that we're a young family and we're definitely going to drive this thing into the ground regardless of what we buy, the one that was going to cost us less to use.
[1103.30 --> 1104.30]  Was a new one.
[1104.30 --> 1108.30]  Unless we wanted to go for something really old, was actually a new one.
[1108.30 --> 1112.30]  Which even just swapping your vehicle in general is kind of annoying.
[1112.30 --> 1114.30]  It's just, it's a pain in the butt.
[1114.30 --> 1115.30]  Yeah.
[1115.30 --> 1121.30]  And so even with the additional insurance cost on a new vehicle, it ended up being more economical over time.
[1121.30 --> 1127.30]  And we are fortunate enough that we're allowed to, that we're able to make those kinds of decisions.
[1127.30 --> 1135.30]  Like not everybody has the financial flexibility to go to Costco, realize paper towels on sale, and buy a year's supply well as half the price.
[1135.30 --> 1136.30]  Yeah.
[1136.30 --> 1137.30]  Like not everyone.
[1137.30 --> 1138.30]  Or the like storage.
[1138.30 --> 1142.30]  You need to have a certain amount of resources in order to optimize your use of resources.
[1142.30 --> 1143.30]  So fortunately we were able to do that.
[1143.30 --> 1145.30]  We bought a brand new minivan.
[1145.30 --> 1152.30]  Anyway, when I was talking to the dealer and I was trying to swing a deal on a used one, they brought up something that I had never considered before.
[1152.30 --> 1158.30]  The season that we were buying a minivan in was road trip season.
[1158.30 --> 1161.30]  And I was like, what are you talking about road trip season?
[1161.30 --> 1163.30]  He's like, look, it's a seller's market.
[1163.30 --> 1164.30]  We're not moving the price.
[1164.30 --> 1167.30]  We've had four people in looking at this van in the last two hours.
[1167.30 --> 1172.30]  And I was like, wait, back up for a second.
[1172.30 --> 1179.30]  People actually realize I'm going to road trip and they go buy a minivan.
[1179.30 --> 1180.30]  And he's like, yeah.
[1180.30 --> 1181.30]  And I'm like, why would they do that?
[1181.30 --> 1182.30]  He goes, well, here's the thing.
[1182.30 --> 1185.30]  I'm waiting for this part because I have no idea.
[1185.30 --> 1190.30]  There's only a finite number of rental minivans in the fleets for the rental companies.
[1190.30 --> 1191.30]  We're totally frozen.
[1191.30 --> 1192.30]  Are we?
[1192.30 --> 1193.30]  Oh, weird.
[1193.30 --> 1197.30]  When did that happen?
[1197.30 --> 1200.30]  I just noticed it.
[1200.30 --> 1201.30]  It might even be working.
[1201.30 --> 1202.30]  There it goes.
[1202.30 --> 1203.30]  Nope.
[1203.30 --> 1204.30]  It's not working.
[1204.30 --> 1206.30]  Why are we frozen?
[1206.30 --> 1207.30]  That's very strange.
[1207.30 --> 1209.30]  I wonder if they can still hear us.
[1209.30 --> 1210.30]  There we go.
[1210.30 --> 1211.30]  We're back.
[1211.30 --> 1212.30]  Okay.
[1212.30 --> 1213.30]  Okay.
[1213.30 --> 1214.30]  Okay.
[1214.30 --> 1215.30]  Okay.
[1215.30 --> 1216.30]  So.
[1216.30 --> 1217.30]  Yeah.
[1217.30 --> 1218.30]  He goes.
[1218.30 --> 1219.30]  Oh.
[1219.30 --> 1220.30]  Okay.
[1220.30 --> 1221.30]  You know what?
[1221.30 --> 1223.30]  I have an idea.
[1223.30 --> 1225.30]  Let's just make sure we're not at a storage.
[1225.30 --> 1226.30]  We're not.
[1226.30 --> 1227.30]  And we're not.
[1227.30 --> 1228.30]  Is it targeting network though?
[1228.30 --> 1230.30]  Because that network drive looks really full.
[1230.30 --> 1233.30]  One second.
[1233.30 --> 1235.30]  It could be.
[1235.30 --> 1238.30]  Oh, crap.
[1238.30 --> 1239.30]  Um.
[1239.30 --> 1240.30]  Uh.
[1240.30 --> 1244.30]  Are you guys ingesting footage right now?
[1244.30 --> 1245.30]  Uh.
[1245.30 --> 1247.30]  I think some of it is.
[1247.30 --> 1248.30]  Okay.
[1248.30 --> 1249.30]  Uh.
[1249.30 --> 1250.30]  Wannick is completely full.
[1250.30 --> 1252.30]  It has two gigs available.
[1252.30 --> 1255.30]  And I think we are actually outputting to it.
[1255.30 --> 1256.30]  So, uh.
[1256.30 --> 1257.30]  Please.
[1257.30 --> 1258.30]  Please fix it.
[1258.30 --> 1259.30]  So fast.
[1259.30 --> 1262.30]  That you can have it fixed very fast.
[1264.30 --> 1265.30]  Recording.
[1265.30 --> 1266.30]  No.
[1266.30 --> 1267.30]  We are recording locally.
[1267.30 --> 1268.30]  Nevermind.
[1268.30 --> 1269.30]  But you guys do still need to fix that.
[1269.30 --> 1270.30]  It was supposed to be recording.
[1270.30 --> 1271.30]  All right.
[1271.30 --> 1272.30]  Anyway.
[1272.30 --> 1273.30]  So.
[1273.30 --> 1274.30]  He goes.
[1274.30 --> 1275.30]  Well.
[1275.30 --> 1276.30]  Here's the thing.
[1276.30 --> 1279.30]  The rental companies only have a certain number of minivans in their rental fleets.
[1279.30 --> 1281.30]  So there's a finite number of them.
[1281.30 --> 1284.30]  And apparently people will book these many months in advance.
[1284.30 --> 1287.30]  So people know that they're going to go on a road trip next summer.
[1287.30 --> 1288.30]  Sure.
[1288.30 --> 1289.30]  They'll book it in October.
[1289.30 --> 1294.30]  And then when the time comes for people to go on their trip, there is nothing.
[1294.30 --> 1295.30]  No available.
[1295.30 --> 1296.30]  And they'll go.
[1296.30 --> 1299.30]  Well, you know, we kind of needed a car upgrade anyway.
[1299.30 --> 1302.30]  And like that's how people will make a purchase decision.
[1302.30 --> 1303.30]  To buy a minivan.
[1303.30 --> 1304.30]  And I was like.
[1304.30 --> 1306.30]  Who the heck buys a minivan for a road trip?
[1306.30 --> 1307.30]  But it's not that really.
[1307.30 --> 1309.30]  But what it is, is it's the push.
[1309.30 --> 1310.30]  Yeah.
[1310.30 --> 1311.30]  It's the, it's the, it's the shot.
[1311.30 --> 1312.30]  I guess I need one anyways.
[1312.30 --> 1313.30]  I'll just do it now.
[1313.30 --> 1314.30]  Yeah.
[1314.30 --> 1316.30]  I mean, if we're going to go on this road trip, maybe we'll go on another one.
[1316.30 --> 1319.30]  This has been such a hassle trying to find something to rent.
[1319.30 --> 1321.30]  I don't trust my vehicle to make it.
[1321.30 --> 1324.30]  We'll have somewhere to put the hockey bags during the rest of the year.
[1324.30 --> 1325.30]  Okay, fine.
[1325.30 --> 1326.30]  You know, honey, let's just go buy a minivan.
[1326.30 --> 1328.30]  I go, wow, that's unbelievable.
[1328.30 --> 1331.30]  And because a minivan is such a.
[1331.30 --> 1332.30]  Interesting.
[1332.30 --> 1335.30]  A non-emotional purchase decision.
[1335.30 --> 1339.30]  Like the only reason anybody buys a minivan is because they need a minivan.
[1339.30 --> 1344.30]  They don't want their dumb kids swinging open a car door and denting the car next to them.
[1344.30 --> 1345.30]  And then they got to leave a note.
[1345.30 --> 1346.30]  And then.
[1346.30 --> 1347.30]  I never thought about that.
[1347.30 --> 1348.30]  Minivans.
[1348.30 --> 1349.30]  Okay.
[1349.30 --> 1350.30]  That totally makes sense.
[1350.30 --> 1351.30]  Minivans are so underrated.
[1351.30 --> 1355.30]  If you have a family, I don't understand why people do the seven seater SUV.
[1355.30 --> 1357.30]  It's so much worse.
[1357.30 --> 1362.30]  A sliding door is like protection for your wallet.
[1362.30 --> 1363.30]  That's right.
[1363.30 --> 1364.30]  That's right.
[1364.30 --> 1365.30]  Okay.
[1365.30 --> 1366.30]  It's not about the kids.
[1366.30 --> 1367.30]  That's about me.
[1367.30 --> 1368.30]  That's pretty cool.
[1368.30 --> 1371.30]  So anyway, where was I going with this?
[1371.30 --> 1372.30]  Right.
[1372.30 --> 1373.30]  So it's not an emotional decision.
[1373.30 --> 1376.30]  You only get a minivan because you like need one.
[1376.30 --> 1382.30]  So what we discovered was that every minivan on the market was priced according to a formula.
[1382.30 --> 1385.30]  Whereas if you're looking at something like a sports car, it might come down to like my.
[1385.30 --> 1386.30]  Rarity.
[1386.30 --> 1392.30]  My brother just picked up some weird Pontiac that's like a mid engine design or something.
[1392.30 --> 1395.30]  And like it's a super old thing.
[1395.30 --> 1399.30]  But for people who are like into this car, they're like, it's like, whoa, yeah.
[1399.30 --> 1400.30]  Wow.
[1400.30 --> 1401.30]  That's such a cool car.
[1401.30 --> 1402.30]  I think it's like a Nissan 240 SX.
[1402.30 --> 1403.30]  Okay.
[1403.30 --> 1404.30]  It's like a Nissan 240 SX.
[1404.30 --> 1408.30]  From like, it's like a 1991 or 92 or 94.
[1408.30 --> 1410.30]  I think it's a 94.
[1410.30 --> 1417.30]  And apparently that car is like the coolest thing ever because both the front and rear wheels actually steer.
[1417.30 --> 1418.30]  Oh, that's weird.
[1418.30 --> 1420.30]  And that was like, that's like a very unusual thing.
[1420.30 --> 1421.30]  And so people are super into this car.
[1421.30 --> 1423.30]  He gets compliments on it all the time.
[1423.30 --> 1426.30]  People are like, wow, that's in great condition.
[1426.30 --> 1427.30]  Are you a collector or something?
[1427.30 --> 1433.30]  He's like, no, I just like bought this new because I thought it was cool in 1994 and I'm still driving it.
[1433.30 --> 1437.30]  Cause I just haven't felt the need to get a different car.
[1439.30 --> 1441.30]  So anyway, where was, where was I going with this?
[1441.30 --> 1442.30]  Right.
[1444.30 --> 1446.30]  Trade-ins, trading in the cars.
[1446.30 --> 1448.30]  We're finally coming around to the topic that we're discussing.
[1448.30 --> 1449.30]  Okay.
[1449.30 --> 1457.30]  I see that as a boon because different times of year have different requirements in terms of the kind of vehicle that you might want to be driving anywhere.
[1457.30 --> 1460.30]  Oh, okay. So we're jumping back to cars as a service, not your minivan.
[1460.30 --> 1461.30]  Yes.
[1461.30 --> 1462.30]  Back to cars as a service.
[1462.30 --> 1463.30]  Okay. Yeah.
[1463.30 --> 1472.30]  So the whole circular thing here was that during the summer, I think I would change more often than 180 days a year anyway.
[1472.30 --> 1473.30]  There.
[1473.30 --> 1477.30]  That's what I'm trying to say because a lot of the time I'd be like, hey, you know what?
[1478.30 --> 1481.30]  Patting about in the leaf makes a ton of sense.
[1481.30 --> 1485.30]  Other times I'd be like, yeah, let's like rip around in 370Z or whatever.
[1487.30 --> 1488.30]  Interesting.
[1488.30 --> 1490.30]  And it comes with a lot of other cool benefits.
[1490.30 --> 1495.30]  So full detail washes, free roadside assistance, the convenience of being able to swap the car at any time.
[1495.30 --> 1496.30]  No maintenance.
[1496.30 --> 1501.30]  It's got sustainable liability insurance with no out-of-pocket deductibles for drivers.
[1501.30 --> 1504.30]  And you keep the car overnight.
[1504.30 --> 1505.30]  Yeah.
[1505.30 --> 1507.30]  Unlike car sharing services like EVO or car to go.
[1507.30 --> 1516.30]  So if something unexpected comes up in the middle of the night, you're, you know, I got the funniest drunk text from someone in one of my badminton group chats.
[1516.30 --> 1523.30]  They like messaged our entire group chat at like three in the morning and there's like 120 people in it or something like that.
[1523.30 --> 1524.30]  Like, don't worry.
[1524.30 --> 1525.30]  I'm okay.
[1525.30 --> 1526.30]  I got home safe.
[1527.30 --> 1536.30]  So if something unexpected, like your idiot teenage daughter or son is like out in the middle of nowhere at some point, you can just go hop in the car and go get them.
[1536.30 --> 1537.30]  Okay.
[1537.30 --> 1542.30]  Would you consider it at a price of eight grand a year?
[1542.30 --> 1543.30]  That's a lot, isn't it?
[1543.30 --> 1545.30]  No, I mean, I wouldn't at all.
[1545.30 --> 1549.30]  That's less than you paid for like your car that you've been driving for five years, isn't it?
[1549.30 --> 1551.30]  No, no, I think it's a little more.
[1551.30 --> 1552.30]  Technically no.
[1552.30 --> 1558.30]  Yeah, but I also paid my car off really quickly and then was like, yeah, no ongoing payments.
[1558.30 --> 1561.30]  Car done paid for, no car payment.
[1561.30 --> 1562.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[1562.30 --> 1564.30]  I'm a little old in that way, I guess.
[1564.30 --> 1569.30]  But to me, it just seems too expensive.
[1569.30 --> 1573.30]  But I think part of this is not, I don't think they care.
[1573.30 --> 1576.30]  I don't think that's the point of this.
[1576.30 --> 1580.30]  And I think part of it too is that they're trying to appeal to a really different buyer.
[1580.30 --> 1583.30]  Like you don't pay for roadside assistance.
[1583.30 --> 1587.30]  I know for a fact because the last time you broke down in the middle of the road, you called me.
[1587.30 --> 1588.30]  Yeah.
[1588.30 --> 1589.30]  So there's that.
[1589.30 --> 1590.30]  You don't wash your car.
[1590.30 --> 1591.30]  No.
[1591.30 --> 1599.30]  So how much value is there for you to having this detailed car experience?
[1599.30 --> 1604.30]  Some people, that's a lot of value and they might actually pay on a regular basis to have their car detailed.
[1604.30 --> 1609.30]  I specifically bought a car that breaks down very little and when it breaks down, it breaks down very cheaply.
[1609.30 --> 1612.30]  That was a huge point.
[1612.30 --> 1614.30]  Sorry, excuse me, accurate.
[1614.30 --> 1615.30]  Same deal.
[1615.30 --> 1617.30]  That was a huge point of the purchasing decision.
[1617.30 --> 1620.30]  It was like that it was not a big deal.
[1620.30 --> 1622.30]  So yeah, it's not for me.
[1622.30 --> 1624.30]  I think some people will be into this.
[1624.30 --> 1628.30]  I think a big part of it too is it's breaking the ice on these types of systems.
[1628.30 --> 1630.30]  And maybe more of these will exist.
[1630.30 --> 1639.30]  And then when they go, oh, now there's an option that's way cheaper and you just have the car show up automatically when you need it.
[1639.30 --> 1640.30]  Yeah.
[1640.30 --> 1643.30]  I think that will, like they will already have the software out there.
[1643.30 --> 1646.30]  It's a really good way to test the apps, make sure all of that's working.
[1646.30 --> 1650.30]  And then eventually the concierges will just be automated driving cars.
[1650.30 --> 1651.30]  Yes.
[1651.30 --> 1656.30]  And that'll be a whole next level thing once the fleets are autonomous.
[1656.30 --> 1657.30]  Yeah.
[1657.30 --> 1658.30]  But yeah.
[1658.30 --> 1659.30]  I think it's cool.
[1659.30 --> 1660.30]  It's interesting.
[1660.30 --> 1665.30]  Like people have pointed out, it's going to be a long time before something like this reaches rural areas.
[1665.30 --> 1666.30]  Oh yeah.
[1666.30 --> 1668.30]  Or even outside of this 20 mile radius.
[1668.30 --> 1669.30]  It's one little town.
[1669.30 --> 1670.30]  Yeah.
[1670.30 --> 1671.30]  Like this is very much the like.
[1671.30 --> 1672.30]  Yeah.
[1672.30 --> 1673.30]  Like one suburb basically.
[1673.30 --> 1676.30]  Like pre-alpha version of what we've been talking about.
[1676.30 --> 1685.30]  Speaking of pre-alpha, I just want to go ahead and do a pre-alpha version of what would be an LTT sponsor read.
[1685.30 --> 1686.30]  Fresh books.
[1686.30 --> 1688.30]  What does that mean?
[1688.30 --> 1689.30]  Fresh books.
[1689.30 --> 1693.30]  It's like, it's good.
[1693.30 --> 1696.30]  And for accounting, it's good.
[1696.30 --> 1697.30]  Oh.
[1697.30 --> 1700.30]  This is, you know, it's like an early.
[1700.30 --> 1701.30]  Oh yeah, I got you.
[1701.30 --> 1704.30]  Yeah, it's an early predecessor to the LTT sponsor read.
[1704.30 --> 1705.30]  Nice.
[1705.30 --> 1710.30]  So if you're a small business owner and you're looking for an easy to use invoicing solution, check out Fresh books.
[1710.30 --> 1716.30]  It allows you to track your time with their time sheet function, manage your expenses with their expenses managing function,
[1716.30 --> 1723.30]  keep track of who owes you what with their keeping track of who owes you what function, and, see he's not paying attention at all.
[1723.30 --> 1724.30]  Sorry.
[1724.30 --> 1726.30]  And their mobile app has all the functionality of their desktop version.
[1726.30 --> 1731.30]  You can also call and talk to a real human at their support center if you have any trouble.
[1731.30 --> 1732.30]  Nice.

[1735.30 --> 1738.30]  Just don't forget to enter when show in the how did you hear about us section.
[1738.30 --> 1741.30]  Actually, I think when is what we want you guys to enter.
[1741.30 --> 1742.30]  That's W-A-N.
[1742.30 --> 1744.30]  Also brought to you by Displate.
[1744.30 --> 1746.30]  Displate is, well it's pretty simple.
[1746.30 --> 1750.30]  It's a magnet mounted metal print that goes on your wall or on-
[1750.30 --> 1751.30]  It's Displate.
[1751.30 --> 1752.30]  Your ceiling or it can go wherever.
[1752.30 --> 1753.30]  Yeah, it's Displate.
[1753.30 --> 1754.30]  Oh, eh.
[1754.30 --> 1759.30]  The amount of disappointment in your face.
[1759.30 --> 1761.30]  And how do we keep it to the wall?
[1761.30 --> 1762.30]  With these nuts.
[1762.30 --> 1763.30]  No, no.
[1763.30 --> 1764.30]  Actually no.
[1764.30 --> 1765.30]  It's with a magnet.
[1765.30 --> 1771.30]  They've got over 250,000 different art spanning a bunch of different styles and influences.
[1771.30 --> 1774.30]  And it's got easy magnetic mounting with no holes in the wall required.
[1774.30 --> 1777.30]  And it's easily replaceable and adjustable.
[1777.30 --> 1780.30]  They plant trees for every Displate purchased.
[1780.30 --> 1781.30]  So why not?
[1781.30 --> 1782.30]  You know, make your walls look great.
[1782.30 --> 1784.30]  Make the planet feel great.
[1784.30 --> 1788.30]  And you can just head to lng.gg slash Displate when.
[1788.30 --> 1792.30]  We've got our own line of Displates including a Linus Displate.
[1792.30 --> 1793.30]  That's right.
[1793.30 --> 1795.30]  Posing in front of my old car.
[1795.30 --> 1798.30]  I really need to do that video about the Volt at some point.
[1798.30 --> 1802.30]  My wife and Alex are both going to kill me.
[1802.30 --> 1806.30]  So we've actually got, we've finally forged a relationship with Tesla.
[1806.30 --> 1808.30]  Oh, that's a pretty cool.
[1808.30 --> 1809.30]  Did we take this picture?
[1809.30 --> 1810.30]  No.
[1810.30 --> 1811.30]  I don't think that's a.
[1811.30 --> 1812.30]  That's just Photoshopped.
[1812.30 --> 1813.30]  Yes.
[1813.30 --> 1814.30]  Okay, cool.
[1814.30 --> 1817.30]  Well, at any rate, that's the LTT collection.
[1817.30 --> 1822.30]  But yeah, my wife and Alex are both going to kill me because she's been wanting me to
[1822.30 --> 1825.30]  do that video because I said I was going to do that video.
[1825.30 --> 1828.30]  And that was part of how I justified getting a new car.
[1828.30 --> 1829.30]  And I haven't done it.
[1829.30 --> 1835.30]  And then Alex finally forged a relationship with Tesla, who is apparently looking into getting
[1835.30 --> 1837.30]  us a loaner Model 3.
[1837.30 --> 1842.30]  So we were 100% honest with them saying, I mean, I said, look, like here, I'll just send you
[1842.30 --> 1843.30]  the clip.
[1843.30 --> 1846.30]  They asked, you know, is there anything that we should know about, you know, you and your
[1846.30 --> 1848.30]  feelings towards Tesla?
[1848.30 --> 1853.30]  Like, and I think what they wanted to know was like, am I shorting Tesla or something
[1853.30 --> 1854.30]  like that?
[1854.30 --> 1855.30]  Am I looking to do damage to the brand?
[1855.30 --> 1858.30]  And I was like, look, I don't own any stake in Tesla.
[1858.30 --> 1861.30]  I don't own any stake in any tech company.
[1861.30 --> 1862.30]  I'm not involved in that way.
[1862.30 --> 1864.30]  I'm just a guy who uses tech.
[1864.30 --> 1866.30]  Honestly, I'm not much of a car guy.
[1866.30 --> 1868.30]  So take that for what it is.
[1868.30 --> 1873.30]  It'll be a tech guy looking at a tech thing and it happens to have wheels on it.
[1873.30 --> 1874.30]  Yeah.
[1874.30 --> 1875.30]  That's basically it.
[1875.30 --> 1876.30]  Yeah.
[1876.30 --> 1878.30]  But apparently they're chill with that.
[1878.30 --> 1879.30]  So that's cool.
[1879.30 --> 1883.30]  And the angle that we're working on is I'm going to do my first video, which is like why
[1883.30 --> 1889.30]  I bought the Volt and then I'm going to do the second video, which is Tesla disagrees
[1889.30 --> 1893.30]  and thinks I should give the Model 3 a shot and I'm going to give it a shot.
[1893.30 --> 1898.30]  So that's the one, two content punch that you guys can expect to see in the next little
[1898.30 --> 1899.30]  bit.
[1899.30 --> 1902.30]  But in order for that to happen, I have to actually finish that bloody video.
[1902.30 --> 1903.30]  Oh, right.
[1903.30 --> 1904.30]  We're not done sponsors.
[1904.30 --> 1907.30]  The show is brought to you today also by Private Internet Access.
[1907.30 --> 1910.30]  Private Internet Access, what does it do?
[1910.30 --> 1915.30]  It's got an app for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, Linux, and it's got a Google Chrome extension
[1915.30 --> 1917.30]  with support for other platforms coming.
[1917.30 --> 1922.30]  They have over 3,000 bare metal servers in 44 locations across 28 countries.
[1922.30 --> 1925.30]  You can connect up to five devices at once with a single account.
[1925.30 --> 1929.30]  It's not in my talking points to tell you guys that you can easily share an account with
[1929.30 --> 1932.30]  your family members, but I certainly did it and do it.
[1932.30 --> 1937.30]  So there's nothing they can do to stop you because part of their whole deal is that they
[1937.30 --> 1938.30]  ain't logging anything.
[1938.30 --> 1939.30]  Woo!
[1939.30 --> 1940.30]  Hooray!
[1940.30 --> 1943.30]  So check it out today at lmg.gg slash PIAWAN.
[1943.30 --> 1946.30]  I'm not going to misrepresent what you can do with a VPN.
[1946.30 --> 1951.30]  So whether you're just trying to keep your ISP from knowing what exactly it is you're
[1951.30 --> 1955.30]  doing, if you're downloading materials that you don't want to get notices in the mail about,
[1955.30 --> 1960.30]  or whether you just want to avoid targeted ads, VPN can be an excellent tool to have at
[1960.30 --> 1961.30]  your disposal.
[1961.30 --> 1962.30]  Yeah.
[1962.30 --> 1965.30]  So you want to make sure that you're disabling cookies and all those.
[1965.30 --> 1969.30]  I had someone posting during the whole debate about, I mean there's been a lot of discussion
[1969.30 --> 1971.30]  around VPNs and sponsorships and all that stuff.
[1971.30 --> 1975.30]  And I saw someone criticizing VPNs because they were like, I'm still getting targeted ads.
[1975.30 --> 1978.30]  And someone was like, well, are you in incognito mode?
[1978.30 --> 1980.30]  Like, did you disable cookies in your browser?
[1980.30 --> 1983.30]  Are you signed into like Facebook and all this other stuff?
[1983.30 --> 1990.30]  A VPN is not a magic bullet, but what it is, is another tool in your chest that you can
[1990.30 --> 1993.30]  use to help protect your anonymity and your privacy online.
[1993.30 --> 1997.30]  So that's lmg.gg slash PIAWAN.
[1997.30 --> 2002.30]  We have worked out the issues that we had with them and we actually covered that on a
[2002.30 --> 2003.30]  previous show.
[2003.30 --> 2008.30]  And there's also a, I think there's a summary version on lmg clips, which is a channel that
[2008.30 --> 2011.30]  for those of you watching the WAN show probably doesn't have a ton of value because it's mostly
[2011.30 --> 2014.30]  just clips from WAN show, but hey, it's there.
[2014.30 --> 2015.30]  All right.
[2015.30 --> 2019.30]  And yes, guys, we know that the audio might be a little bit desynced.
[2019.30 --> 2020.30]  There's nothing we can do about it.
[2020.30 --> 2025.30]  It looks like our encoder might've just like thrown up all over itself at some point during
[2025.30 --> 2027.30]  the video today, but it's going now.
[2027.30 --> 2029.30]  So hopefully the VOD is fine.
[2029.30 --> 2030.30]  I don't know what to tell you guys.
[2030.30 --> 2032.30]  All right.
[2032.30 --> 2034.30]  What else we got for topics today?
[2034.30 --> 2035.30]  Nick is hovering around.
[2035.30 --> 2038.30]  So I'm guessing he has an LTT store.com thing to tell you guys about.
[2038.30 --> 2040.30]  Oh, there's our, there's our new cheaper shipping rates.
[2040.30 --> 2041.30]  Yeah.
[2041.30 --> 2042.30]  So that's sick.
[2042.30 --> 2043.30]  What are the rates again?
[2043.30 --> 2044.30]  It's 899 for us.
[2044.30 --> 2045.30]  Yep.
[2045.30 --> 2046.30]  1299 for Canada.
[2046.30 --> 2047.30]  Yep.
[2047.30 --> 2048.30]  And 1599 anywhere else in the world.
[2048.30 --> 2049.30]  Sweet.
[2049.30 --> 2050.30]  Yeah.
[2050.30 --> 2051.30]  All right.
[2051.30 --> 2052.30]  And we have all the shirts restocked.
[2052.30 --> 2053.30]  Nice.
[2053.30 --> 2054.30]  We still have underwear, right?
[2054.30 --> 2055.30]  Yeah.
[2055.30 --> 2056.30]  All sizes.
[2056.30 --> 2057.30]  Okay.
[2057.30 --> 2058.30]  Cool.
[2058.30 --> 2059.30]  Yeah.
[2059.30 --> 2061.30]  But we have barely any self hoodies and we won't have any more for like a month.
[2061.30 --> 2062.30]  Oh, okay.
[2062.30 --> 2063.30]  So if you want a stealth hoodie, make sure you get it now, basically.
[2063.30 --> 2064.30]  Yeah.
[2064.30 --> 2065.30]  They're going to be sold out within like a week.
[2065.30 --> 2066.30]  Okay.
[2066.30 --> 2067.30]  Cool.
[2067.30 --> 2068.30]  Probably less now that we said that.
[2068.30 --> 2069.30]  Probably less now that we said that.
[2069.30 --> 2070.30]  Way to go, Nick.
[2070.30 --> 2071.30]  No.
[2071.30 --> 2072.30]  Way to go.
[2072.30 --> 2074.30]  It's going to look bad on your KPI report for March.
[2074.30 --> 2075.30]  Oh, man.
[2075.30 --> 2076.30]  Because they're going to sell all the stealth hoodies this month.
[2076.30 --> 2077.30]  Have you noticed any, if you might not even want to talk about this, I don't know.
[2077.30 --> 2078.30]  Yeah.
[2078.30 --> 2090.30]  Have you noticed any purchasing changes since the shipping changes have happened?
[2090.30 --> 2093.30]  Like regional purchasing changes at all?
[2093.30 --> 2095.30]  I actually haven't looked at it, so.
[2095.30 --> 2097.30]  I haven't delved too deep into the data.
[2097.30 --> 2100.30]  It seems like cart values are higher.
[2100.30 --> 2105.30]  So it seems like people are like, oh, I can pay just once $15.99 for shipping, I'll just
[2105.30 --> 2107.30]  buy like $150 worth of stuff.
[2107.30 --> 2108.30]  Wow.
[2108.30 --> 2109.30]  Okay.
[2109.30 --> 2110.30]  All right.
[2110.30 --> 2111.30]  Sure.
[2111.30 --> 2112.30]  Cool.
[2112.30 --> 2113.30]  That'll work.
[2113.30 --> 2114.30]  Yeah.
[2114.30 --> 2115.30]  Not complaining.
[2115.30 --> 2117.30]  Maybe we should take suggestions in the comments if people want to.
[2117.30 --> 2121.30]  We're thinking about doing a WAN show specific shirt because we haven't had WAN merch for
[2121.30 --> 2122.30]  like a long time.
[2122.30 --> 2124.30]  Oh, and that was some of the original merch.
[2124.30 --> 2125.30]  Yeah.
[2125.30 --> 2128.30]  So if people have ideas for what they'd want to see, let us know in the comments.
[2128.30 --> 2129.30]  Yeah.
[2129.30 --> 2130.30]  That'd be cool.
[2130.30 --> 2131.30]  Yeah.
[2131.30 --> 2132.30]  Yeah.
[2132.30 --> 2135.30]  People are going to ask for like a WAN hoodie redux.
[2135.30 --> 2140.30]  Well, now that you said that they're going to, you frickin' dodo.
[2140.30 --> 2142.30]  I think it'd be pretty cool.
[2142.30 --> 2143.30]  Yeah.
[2143.30 --> 2144.30]  Yeah.
[2144.30 --> 2145.30]  Yeah.
[2145.30 --> 2146.30]  WAN hoodie V2.
[2146.30 --> 2150.30]  Like not the exact same one, right?
[2150.30 --> 2154.30]  Lloyd's head is going to explode when we assign him that.
[2154.30 --> 2160.30]  It pains me when you ask for things like this because, you know, there's a reason it went
[2160.30 --> 2161.30]  away.
[2161.30 --> 2162.30]  It's because it wasn't that popular.
[2162.30 --> 2163.30]  Oh, yeah.
[2163.30 --> 2164.30]  No, it's very dated.
[2164.30 --> 2165.30]  And no, it wasn't that popular.
[2165.30 --> 2166.30]  Okay.
[2166.30 --> 2168.30]  We were much smaller when we, when we, and it was very expensive.
[2168.30 --> 2170.30]  Our cost on that thing was ridiculous.
[2170.30 --> 2171.30]  It was so expensive.
[2171.30 --> 2173.30]  I think you can even say what it was if you want.
[2173.30 --> 2174.30]  Yeah.
[2174.30 --> 2175.30]  I don't remember what it was.
[2175.30 --> 2176.30]  I just remember it was ridiculous.
[2176.30 --> 2177.30]  What was our cost on WAN hoodie?
[2177.30 --> 2178.30]  It was like over $50.
[2178.30 --> 2179.30]  Yeah.
[2179.30 --> 2180.30]  Okay.
[2180.30 --> 2181.30]  So there you go.
[2181.30 --> 2182.30]  You can buy it and store it for a very long time.
[2182.30 --> 2185.30]  And then we were selling through retailers.
[2185.30 --> 2187.30]  So there's a percentage that they have to take.
[2187.30 --> 2188.30]  Yup.
[2188.30 --> 2190.30]  So that was a whole, that was a whole thing.
[2190.30 --> 2191.30]  It's different now.
[2191.30 --> 2194.30]  But yeah, anyway.
[2194.30 --> 2195.30]  All right.
[2195.30 --> 2198.30]  So we've got some other great topics for today.
[2198.30 --> 2202.30]  Switzerland halts their rollout of 5G over health concerns.
[2202.30 --> 2206.30]  So the Swiss government was, this was posted on the forum by Delicieuse.
[2206.30 --> 2211.30]  And the Swiss government was one of the world leaders of the 5G roll, was one of the world
[2211.30 --> 2212.30]  leaders when it came to rolling out 5G.
[2212.30 --> 2215.30]  But now the Swiss federal office for the environment or Bafu.
[2215.30 --> 2216.30]  Bafu.
[2216.30 --> 2217.30]  Love it.
[2217.30 --> 2218.30]  Sounds so friendly.
[2218.30 --> 2219.30]  I know.
[2219.30 --> 2226.30]  Sent a letter to the country's Canton governments urging a timeout on the use of all new 5G towers.
[2226.30 --> 2230.30]  So they're responsible for providing the Cantons with safety criteria against which telecoms
[2230.30 --> 2233.30]  operators radiation emissions can be judged.
[2233.30 --> 2237.30]  Under Switzerland's federal structure, telecoms infrastructure is monitored for compliance by
[2237.30 --> 2240.30]  Cantonic, Cantonal, Cantonal?
[2240.30 --> 2242.30]  I'm not going to know how to pronounce these things.
[2242.30 --> 2245.30]  Authorities, while this was capital, Bern is responsible for setting the frameworks.
[2245.30 --> 2250.30]  I think that essentially means like the local governments of like the provinces or states,
[2250.30 --> 2252.30]  but they use Cantons thing.
[2252.30 --> 2253.30]  Okay.
[2253.30 --> 2258.30]  So several Cantons had already imposed voluntary moratoria, which means timeouts basically,
[2258.30 --> 2261.30]  due to rising uncertainty over the health risks.
[2261.30 --> 2266.30]  And their assessment process would not halt its ongoing work to build out 5G infrastructure,
[2266.30 --> 2267.30]  even if it meant it would not be used.
[2267.30 --> 2269.30]  So they're still going to be rolling it out.
[2269.30 --> 2272.30]  They're just not necessarily going to be using it.
[2272.30 --> 2273.30]  Interesting.
[2273.30 --> 2278.30]  So Swisscom claims customers will still be able to achieve speeds of up to 2 gigabit per second
[2278.30 --> 2280.30]  without the full use of the new masts.
[2280.30 --> 2287.30]  And according to Swisscom, there is no evidence that antenna radiation within the limit values adversely,
[2287.30 --> 2291.30]  within the radiation limit adversely affects human health.
[2291.30 --> 2292.30]  Okay.
[2292.30 --> 2294.30]  There's some funky stuff.
[2294.30 --> 2302.30]  Five popular initiatives proposals for legally binding referenda have already launched on 5G use,
[2302.30 --> 2309.30]  with two formulized and in the process of collecting the 100,000 signatures required to hold a nationwide vote.
[2309.30 --> 2322.30]  One will make the telecoms companies legally viable for claims of bodily damage caused by radiation from masks unless they can prove otherwise.
[2322.30 --> 2323.30]  Wow.
[2323.30 --> 2326.30]  That sounds terrible.
[2326.30 --> 2330.30]  Would basically mean, probably, that just no one would roll it out.
[2330.30 --> 2337.30]  People would have like insomnia and be like, well, it's because it started right when all the 5G towers went in.
[2337.30 --> 2343.30]  I mean, I've talked to people like this that think that, you know, anxiety is caused by RF.
[2343.30 --> 2348.30]  And, you know, actually insomnia was one of the examples.
[2348.30 --> 2353.30]  Or just like a general sense of unease and nausea is caused by RF.
[2353.30 --> 2357.30]  I mean, how do you, and how do you, oh man, how do you study that?
[2357.30 --> 2368.30]  Like, how do you do a, how do you, because the thing about that type of belief is that no amount of blind A-B testing is going to prove it to them.
[2368.30 --> 2375.30]  And if they get it right half of the time, that's like glass half full to certain types of people.
[2375.30 --> 2378.30]  That's like, wow, well, like 50% is a lot.
[2378.30 --> 2380.30]  That was a pass in my school.
[2380.30 --> 2382.30]  So I nailed it.
[2382.30 --> 2383.30]  Yeah.
[2383.30 --> 2384.30]  Interesting.
[2384.30 --> 2385.30]  Yeah.
[2385.30 --> 2394.30]  I think honestly, if that law goes through, I think it would be very dangerous and probably not a good idea for a lot of telecoms to roll it out.
[2394.30 --> 2402.30]  Anthony has a note here that he says the cost of defending such lawsuits could be immense given that the burden of proof falls on the defendant.
[2402.30 --> 2403.30]  Yeah.
[2403.30 --> 2406.30]  Like that's, you're just setting yourself up for failure.
[2406.30 --> 2407.30]  Yeah.
[2407.30 --> 2412.30]  Well, hopefully that's not what we're looking at.
[2412.30 --> 2415.30]  I mean, I don't live in Switzerland, so I guess it's sort of a non-factor.
[2415.30 --> 2418.30]  Tell us is just kind of like, yeah.
[2418.30 --> 2419.30]  Yeah.
[2419.30 --> 2420.30]  Tell us like, Huawei.
[2420.30 --> 2421.30]  Yeah.
[2421.30 --> 2423.30]  We don't care at all.
[2423.30 --> 2424.30]  Yeah, I saw that.
[2424.30 --> 2426.30]  Have you heard their thing?
[2426.30 --> 2429.30]  This is, this is completely outside of the current documentation stuff.
[2429.30 --> 2441.30]  I don't remember what they're called, but the Canadian government is trying to push for, you know how like there's some wired internet providers that are just piggybacks on top of other companies?
[2441.30 --> 2442.30]  Mm-hmm.
[2442.30 --> 2443.30]  They use their infrastructure?
[2443.30 --> 2444.30]  Yep.
[2444.30 --> 2446.30]  They're trying to push for that for wireless providers as well.
[2446.30 --> 2447.30]  Yeah.
[2447.30 --> 2448.30]  Heck yeah.
[2448.30 --> 2451.30]  Because basically every, like additional wireless provider is just a subset of a current one.
[2451.30 --> 2452.30]  Yes.
[2452.30 --> 2453.30]  Like kudos just tell us.
[2453.30 --> 2454.30]  Kudos tell us.
[2454.30 --> 2456.30]  And then what's Rogers' cheap one?
[2456.30 --> 2457.30]  I don't remember.
[2457.30 --> 2458.30]  I can't remember.
[2458.30 --> 2459.30]  It doesn't matter.
[2459.30 --> 2471.30]  But they all have like their own little, but they're trying to make it so there's other companies that can jump in and tell us has just straight up said, if you do that, we're going to fire, I think it's like two to 5,000 people and reduce our spending in Canada by a billion dollars.
[2471.30 --> 2474.30]  They're just like, ah, blip.
[2474.30 --> 2475.30]  I don't know.
[2475.30 --> 2477.30]  Part of me is just like, screw them.
[2477.30 --> 2478.30]  Just do it anyways.
[2478.30 --> 2480.30]  They are such butt heads.
[2480.30 --> 2481.30]  Yeah.
[2481.30 --> 2482.30]  Like honestly.
[2482.30 --> 2483.30]  Yeah.
[2483.30 --> 2491.30]  I hate giving them my money, but Shaw does not have anything even remotely comparable to tell us his internet service.
[2491.30 --> 2492.30]  And Shaw's butt heads too.
[2492.30 --> 2498.30]  They're butt heads, but they're, they've been the lesser butt head of two butt heads from my experience.
[2498.30 --> 2499.30]  I haven't looked into it enough.
[2499.30 --> 2500.30]  I don't know.
[2500.30 --> 2502.30]  Well, that's this, I'm talking like personal experience.
[2502.30 --> 2506.30]  Like tell us has screwed me over so many times.
[2506.30 --> 2508.30]  Shaw just lies about their fiber.
[2509.30 --> 2510.30]  They say they have fiber.
[2510.30 --> 2511.30]  Yeah.
[2511.30 --> 2512.30]  Oh, well, they don't.
[2512.30 --> 2513.30]  I know.
[2513.30 --> 2514.30]  Oh, okay.
[2514.30 --> 2515.30]  Yeah.
[2515.30 --> 2516.30]  Yeah.
[2516.30 --> 2517.30]  They're like on docsis too or whatever.
[2517.30 --> 2518.30]  Yeah.
[2518.30 --> 2519.30]  They fiber to the node and then they cop it to your house.
[2519.30 --> 2520.30]  They're like fiber.
[2520.30 --> 2521.30]  It's like not fiber.
[2521.30 --> 2522.30]  Not how that works.
[2522.30 --> 2523.30]  It's called FTTH.
[2523.30 --> 2524.30]  Yeah.
[2524.30 --> 2525.30]  Yeah.
[2525.30 --> 2526.30]  I don't, I don't like that.
[2526.30 --> 2528.30]  That bugs me a lot about Shaw.
[2528.30 --> 2531.30]  I mean, they've also like got nothing.
[2531.30 --> 2535.30]  So other than skeezy marketing, what are they going to do?
[2535.30 --> 2537.30]  That's kind of fair.
[2537.30 --> 2538.30]  I don't know.
[2538.30 --> 2541.30]  Our ISPs suck, but then I kind of think most people's ISPs.
[2541.30 --> 2542.30]  Yeah.
[2542.30 --> 2544.30]  This is a very relatable topic, right boys and girls?
[2544.30 --> 2545.30]  Yeah.
[2545.30 --> 2546.30]  All right.
[2546.30 --> 2547.30]  Forget folds.
[2547.30 --> 2549.30]  This phone has an expanding screen.
[2549.30 --> 2551.30]  I think we talked about this.
[2551.30 --> 2552.30]  Didn't we?
[2552.30 --> 2553.30]  Oh no, this is a different one.
[2553.30 --> 2556.30]  So TCL, apparently this is, this is great.
[2556.30 --> 2559.30]  So these leaked images are up on the verge.
[2559.30 --> 2569.30]  TCL had images leak of a prototype phone with an expanding slide out display.
[2569.30 --> 2572.30]  What does that even mean?
[2572.30 --> 2576.30]  I find it very telling that you can't see the back of the phone.
[2576.30 --> 2584.30]  So it will apparently work like an extended dining table with a second display that slides out from underneath the first.
[2585.30 --> 2587.30]  Wait, what?
[2589.30 --> 2592.30]  Compelling picture of what the device could be.
[2592.30 --> 2602.30]  And of course we don't have anything in motion, but like, wait, are they talking like it slides like this and then the screen is just like kind of jammed in there and then comes out flat?
[2602.30 --> 2603.30]  If you look at the image.
[2603.30 --> 2604.30]  Yeah.
[2604.30 --> 2605.30]  Can you zoom in on that?
[2605.30 --> 2606.30]  Enhance.
[2606.30 --> 2607.30]  Enhance.
[2607.30 --> 2610.30]  Look at where the camera is.
[2610.30 --> 2615.30]  See on the left one there's a split just to the left of the camera.
[2615.30 --> 2616.30]  Yep.
[2616.30 --> 2617.30]  On the frame.
[2617.30 --> 2618.30]  And then you hear there's a back there.
[2618.30 --> 2619.30]  And then the camera's on the far side.
[2619.30 --> 2623.30]  So yeah, they're kind of saying that the middle comes from behind.
[2623.30 --> 2624.30]  In here.
[2624.30 --> 2625.30]  Sort of.
[2625.30 --> 2628.30]  I mean, I should have like a seam of some sort here.
[2628.30 --> 2632.30]  Yeah, I mean this render is very happy to not show anything.
[2632.30 --> 2643.30]  I mean, I guess I'd probably rather have a seam in like traditional normal phone mode compared to using that tiny display on the outside of the Galaxy Fold.
[2643.30 --> 2647.30]  Like if it's going to be a compromise no matter how you fold it.
[2647.30 --> 2648.30]  Hey!
[2648.30 --> 2649.30]  Um.
[2649.30 --> 2650.30]  Yeah.
[2650.30 --> 2654.30]  This seems like a reasonable one, I suppose.
[2654.30 --> 2655.30]  Alright.
[2655.30 --> 2657.30]  I'm into it.
[2657.30 --> 2658.30]  I'm into it.
[2658.30 --> 2661.30]  I mean, I'm super into the whole foldable phone concept though.
[2661.30 --> 2662.30]  Not everyone is, but.
[2662.30 --> 2668.30]  I don't, I still don't fully, maybe I'm just dumb or missing something, but I still don't fully understand how this one works.
[2668.30 --> 2669.30]  Me neither.
[2669.30 --> 2670.30]  So we'll see.
[2670.30 --> 2672.30]  It also might just be a concept image.
[2672.30 --> 2675.30]  Like they might not have a working prototype of this.
[2675.30 --> 2681.30]  Like there could be an extremely thin screen behind the other screen, which is going to be tough as heck to do.
[2681.30 --> 2688.30]  And then when you pull it out, the like transparent material over the screen maybe expands somehow.
[2688.30 --> 2689.30]  Yeah.
[2689.30 --> 2690.30]  And that screen just like slides in.
[2690.30 --> 2693.30]  Because I can't imagine it's like a chunk behind the device.
[2693.30 --> 2694.30]  I mean that is one way.
[2694.30 --> 2695.30]  That like clicks into place.
[2695.30 --> 2696.30]  I mean that is one way.
[2696.30 --> 2697.30]  That's one way you could do it.
[2697.30 --> 2698.30]  Like a, like a leaf in a table.
[2698.30 --> 2700.30]  You could pull it apart and then it could be like.
[2700.30 --> 2701.30]  Yeah.
[2701.30 --> 2702.30]  That would be such.
[2702.30 --> 2705.30]  That sounds like failure rate through the roof.
[2705.30 --> 2708.30]  Yeah, that would be a spectacularly complicated mechanism.
[2708.30 --> 2709.30]  Terrible experience.
[2709.30 --> 2710.30]  Just like, so I don't know.
[2710.30 --> 2713.30]  I just seems derpy.
[2713.30 --> 2715.30]  So it's not close.
[2715.30 --> 2719.30]  So from, from our notes here, it's not clear exactly how the mechanism inside would work.
[2719.30 --> 2724.30]  And the extended portion would apparently have its own non glass backing to support the display.
[2724.30 --> 2728.30]  So it looks like you would kind of have to hold it in your left hand.
[2728.30 --> 2731.30]  And then it would just be like kind of a skinny thing.
[2731.30 --> 2732.30]  Yeah.
[2732.30 --> 2734.30]  Whereas the fold really is more like a, like a tablet.
[2734.30 --> 2735.30]  Yeah.
[2735.30 --> 2742.30]  Um, appears to be based on the TCL 10 Pro, which is a sub $500 phone they launched last month at CES.
[2742.30 --> 2749.30]  They were apparently planning to show this concept at Mobile World Congress this month before it was cancelled due to virus concerns.
[2749.30 --> 2752.30]  You should just do it anyways because internet exists.
[2752.30 --> 2753.30]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2753.30 --> 2754.30]  Who cares?
[2754.30 --> 2755.30]  You know how it is.
[2755.30 --> 2756.30]  Yeah.
[2756.30 --> 2761.30]  Um, so then, ooh, should we talk about HTC Project Photon?
[2761.30 --> 2762.30]  Yes.
[2762.30 --> 2763.30]  Okay, go ahead.
[2763.30 --> 2765.30]  Uh, where is it?
[2765.30 --> 2766.30]  Hold on.
[2766.30 --> 2769.30]  Yeah, HTC revealed two versions of their prototype design.
[2769.30 --> 2771.30]  Can we get the picture on screen?
[2771.30 --> 2772.30]  Yeah.
[2772.30 --> 2777.30]  One that's fully self-contained and one that offloads some components to a wired external pack.
[2777.30 --> 2783.30]  If you go way the heck back in WAN shows, I'm guessing four or five years.
[2783.30 --> 2784.30]  We called this.
[2784.30 --> 2785.30]  We called this.
[2785.30 --> 2786.30]  100%.
[2786.30 --> 2790.30]  We did say that it will eventually be a wireless puck.
[2790.30 --> 2791.30]  Right.
[2791.30 --> 2796.30]  So we're not quite there yet, but they are clearly going in that direction.
[2796.30 --> 2798.30]  Um, these are still way too chonky.
[2798.30 --> 2799.30]  Yeah.
[2799.30 --> 2801.30]  They're gonna have to slim down.
[2801.30 --> 2804.30]  But like, you can tell the direction that the industry is going in.
[2804.30 --> 2805.30]  That's so cool.
[2805.30 --> 2807.30]  So like a compute pack.
[2807.30 --> 2808.30]  Yeah.
[2808.30 --> 2814.30]  Which, again, completely called it just a really long time ago.
[2814.30 --> 2815.30]  Nice.
[2815.30 --> 2816.30]  Yeah.
[2816.30 --> 2823.30]  Um, designed to look more like sunglasses than the usual VR headset look, except they still look extremely VR headset-like.
[2823.30 --> 2824.30]  Oh, yeah.
[2824.30 --> 2825.30]  They are still way too clunky.
[2825.30 --> 2826.30]  Oh, yeah.
[2826.30 --> 2827.30]  James Bond wouldn't wear those.
[2827.30 --> 2828.30]  No.
[2828.30 --> 2829.30]  Yeah.
[2829.30 --> 2830.30]  No.
[2830.30 --> 2831.30]  Yeah.
[2831.30 --> 2832.30]  Yeah.
[2832.30 --> 2833.30]  Yeah.
[2833.30 --> 2834.30]  Yeah.
[2834.30 --> 2835.30]  Yeah.
[2835.30 --> 2840.30]  It's a pointer style controller, not fully tracked motion controllers like the Cosmos.
[2840.30 --> 2846.30]  Both devices appear to sport front facing cameras similar to like the snap glasses.
[2846.30 --> 2852.30]  Um, and which would be used for pass through view of the wearer's surroundings.
[2852.30 --> 2860.30]  So, it's not that like, uh, transparent screen AR stuff, which is what I think most people actually
[2860.30 --> 2861.30]  want.
[2861.30 --> 2862.30]  I think, uh, I think I'm gonna, uh, I think I'm gonna put it in a second.
[2862.30 --> 2863.30]  I love this.
[2863.30 --> 2866.30]  Found myself in silence says, screen rolled up like a scroll.
[2866.30 --> 2867.30]  That'd be awesome.
[2867.30 --> 2868.30]  Anyway, that was horrible.
[2868.30 --> 2869.30]  That was all I wanted to share.
[2869.30 --> 2870.30]  Yeah.
[2870.30 --> 2871.30]  Yeah, terrible.
[2871.30 --> 2872.30]  I'd love to see people using it.
[2872.30 --> 2873.30]  I'd love that, too.
[2873.30 --> 2874.30]  Yeah.
[2874.30 --> 2876.30]  I would never ever buy one.
[2876.30 --> 2882.30]  Um, the models appear to lack speakers, so it's unclear how audio will be handled.
[2882.30 --> 2883.30]  Uh, probably Bluetooth.
[2883.30 --> 2887.30]  Um, the lack of straps indicated, uh, in the designs.
[2887.30 --> 2891.30]  Indicates the designs are light enough to use with the sunglasses style.
[2891.30 --> 2892.30]  Yeah, but there was straps, wasn't there?
[2892.30 --> 2896.30]  Uh, I think there were like different versions of it.
[2896.30 --> 2897.30]  I can pull it back up.
[2897.30 --> 2898.30]  Give me one sec.
[2898.30 --> 2899.30]  Yeah, here we go.
[2899.30 --> 2901.30]  Uh, line of screen.
[2901.30 --> 2902.30]  We need a producer.
[2902.30 --> 2906.30]  Yeah, so it looks like there's like a non-strappy version.
[2906.30 --> 2907.30]  Oh, okay.
[2907.30 --> 2911.30]  And then this looks like it might be a version where like the compute pack is at the back.
[2911.30 --> 2912.30]  Is in the back, okay.
[2912.30 --> 2914.30]  Yeah, versus, uh, on a tether.
[2914.30 --> 2915.30]  So this one looks like it's on a tether here.
[2915.30 --> 2918.30]  So I think the, yeah, I think the downright one's more the new one.
[2918.30 --> 2919.30]  Yeah.
[2919.30 --> 2921.30]  All right, is there anything else?
[2921.30 --> 2922.30]  It's cool.
[2922.30 --> 2924.30]  It's far from where it needs to be, but it's cool.
[2924.30 --> 2926.30]  Anything else we really wanted to talk about?
[2926.30 --> 2928.30]  I mean, we teased the PCI Express 6.0.
[2928.30 --> 2930.30]  Yeah, let's just go over that quickly.
[2930.30 --> 2931.30]  Yep.
[2931.30 --> 2934.30]  Data rates are double PCIe 5, so 64 gigatransfers per second.
[2934.30 --> 2938.30]  So that's four times PCIe 4 and eight times PCIe 3.
[2938.30 --> 2942.30]  For those of you wondering, uh, we actually are thinking of doing a video in the next little bit
[2942.30 --> 2945.30]  on how PCIe 4.0 could benefit the consumer.
[2945.30 --> 2948.30]  There are some graphics workloads that do benefit from it.
[2948.30 --> 2953.30]  Um, the problem is just there's kind of a lack of, you can't really do much in the way of cross-platform testing,
[2953.30 --> 2959.30]  which means you can't do much in the way of comparative testing, um, because you've only got one platform
[2959.30 --> 2965.30]  that supports PCIe Gen 4 on the motherboards and only got one vendor that supports Gen 4 on the graphics cards.
[2965.30 --> 2970.30]  I think one way that it's going to benefit consumers regardless is hardware kind of needs to go first.
[2970.30 --> 2972.30]  Mm-hmm.
[2972.30 --> 2977.30]  And for, like, graphics cards to get to the point where they're using it, it needs to be available on the motherboard side, etc.
[2977.30 --> 2978.30]  Yes.
[2978.30 --> 2982.30]  So, like, PCIe needs to run way ahead of the rest of the industry.
[2982.30 --> 2988.30]  Man, so that is a maximum raw bitrate of 256 gigabytes per second on a 16x slot.
[2988.30 --> 2993.30]  That's nuts. I have no idea how we're going to do this, to be perfectly honest with you.
[2993.30 --> 3001.30]  I mean, we already ran into such problems trying to do, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 gigabytes a second
[3001.30 --> 3009.30]  using all of the PCIe Gen 4 lanes, and we were even only running them at Gen 3 speeds on that, um, that epic NVMe server.
[3009.30 --> 3012.30]  Like, the CPU just was overwhelmed.
[3012.30 --> 3018.30]  Now, maybe part of that is that it's storage and the way that a storage device is accessed over PCIe
[3018.30 --> 3025.30]  is different from graphics cards or whatever else, but right now, those are the two compelling things that you plug into PCIe,
[3025.30 --> 3033.30]  storage and graphics, so, like, what's going to happen when we're quadrupling that?
[3033.30 --> 3035.30]  Um, I don't know.
[3035.30 --> 3036.30]  Yeah.
[3036.30 --> 3041.30]  We'll see. It's interesting, though. It's fun. New stuff coming down the line.
[3041.30 --> 3046.30]  Forward error correction, pulse amplitude modulation, all kinds of cool stuff.
[3046.30 --> 3051.30]  So, once it's ratified, it'll hit the data center and scientific applications first, then trickle down to the mainstream.
[3051.30 --> 3057.30]  So, we're really far out. The on track for 2021 is not on track for 2021 for you.
[3057.30 --> 3060.30]  Yeah, not for you. Sorry. That's, like, for ratification.
[3060.30 --> 3061.30]  Yeah.
[3061.30 --> 3067.30]  Uh, alright. So, viewer activity. We can do a handful of super chats and then we're ahead.
[3067.30 --> 3070.30]  No. Polarfish. Hi. How much is a good gaming setup?
[3070.30 --> 3078.30]  Um, I mean, it depends. If you're into, like, LGR, good gaming setup, I don't know, 25 bucks?
[3078.30 --> 3086.30]  Uh, that's, uh, Lazy Game Reviews. So, he does, like, a lot of, like, budget, um, like, budget-type stuff.
[3086.30 --> 3093.30]  Um, if you're into, like, something more modern but also, like, very optimized, you can check out LowSpec Gamer.
[3093.30 --> 3095.30]  Uh, maybe, like, what, 100 bucks for a good gaming rig?
[3095.30 --> 3097.30]  It really depends what you want to do. It's what he's trying to get at.
[3097.30 --> 3104.30]  Really depends what you're trying to do. If you're trying to play, like, the latest AAA titles at 4K 140-40 hertz, then you better spend $5,000.
[3104.30 --> 3105.30]  Better spend $5,000. Decently expensive.
[3105.30 --> 3109.30]  We actually did a video a little while ago answering this question. I'm being facetious right now.
[3109.30 --> 3115.30]  So, it's called Gaming at Every Price Point, where we took a bunch of different price points and showed what the experience looks like.
[3115.30 --> 3121.30]  That was a really cool, I don't know how much foot traffic it got, but that was a very cool LTX demo.
[3121.30 --> 3126.30]  I thought so, too. I don't know that it got a ton of foot traffic. I don't think we're planning to bring it back again this year.
[3126.30 --> 3127.30]  So, it is what it is.
[3127.30 --> 3129.30]  It's a cool idea. I like the concept.
[3129.30 --> 3135.30]  Um, when are you going to review dog video chat tech with Cadence, Jono's dog?
[3135.30 --> 3139.30]  Um, did he put you up to this? Never?
[3139.30 --> 3140.30]  I think so.
[3140.30 --> 3145.30]  Uh, thanks, Michael Lame. First live WAN show after being subbed for five years.
[3145.30 --> 3146.30]  Wow.
[3146.30 --> 3147.30]  There we go.
[3147.30 --> 3153.30]  Uh, Pat says, can we roast Alex's pronunciation of Alcantara on the new Surface video?
[3153.30 --> 3154.30]  How did he say it?
[3154.30 --> 3156.30]  Uh, I think he said Alcantara.
[3156.30 --> 3157.30]  Oh.
[3157.30 --> 3158.30]  Yeah, it's one of those things where like if it's a-
[3158.30 --> 3159.30]  If you haven't heard it.
[3159.30 --> 3164.30]  Yeah, if it's a word you've only read, then I can totally understand why you would think it's either way.
[3164.30 --> 3167.30]  Um, oh well.
[3167.30 --> 3171.30]  Uh, Terry says, have my soon to expire Google Rewards money. Nice.
[3171.30 --> 3172.30]  Oh, no.
[3172.30 --> 3175.30]  Any news on LTX dates and location? Of course. August 8th and 9th.
[3175.30 --> 3176.30]  Yeah.
[3176.30 --> 3180.30]  And it's gonna be at the Vancouver Convention Center. We've already got a ton of creators confirmed.
[3180.30 --> 3188.30]  I'm actually gonna use this opportunity to pimp LTX Expo because guys, this year is going to be sick.
[3188.30 --> 3193.30]  Uh, do we have- ah, yes. Special guests. So here's what we've got confirmed so far.
[3193.30 --> 3204.30]  Tech Tangents, Ant Venom, Low Spec Gamer, BPS Customs, Austin Evans, Real Hardware Reviews, Bad Seed Tech, Dawid Does Tech, Jay's Two Cents, Gamers Nexus, Sarah Dietschy, Shellback Tech,
[3204.30 --> 3212.30]  Epos Vox, Greg Salazar from Science Studio, David Amell, Bitwit, and Scotty from Strange Parts.
[3212.30 --> 3218.30]  And that, my friends, is only the beginning. I have doubled our Creator Travel budget.
[3218.30 --> 3219.30]  Oh.
[3219.30 --> 3228.30]  And, well, some of it is going into making the trip a little bit more pleasant for them. So instead of just doing two hotel nights, which is what we did last year, we didn't have any money last year.
[3228.30 --> 3235.30]  This year, we've actually got- oh, I don't think I can confirm it yet, but we've got a big sponsor that is going a long way towards this event.
[3235.30 --> 3239.30]  Maybe even actually making money this year, which would be pretty cool.
[3239.30 --> 3240.30]  Wow.
[3240.30 --> 3245.30]  And so, of course, naturally the first thing that I did was decide to blow a bunch of it on-
[3245.30 --> 3246.30]  Creators.
[3246.30 --> 3257.30]  Yeah, on Creators. So, I believe I offered everyone the option to have up to another night or two of hotel if they just want to like hang around and make it for a little bit.
[3257.30 --> 3258.30]  Yeah.
[3258.30 --> 3261.30]  So, I want LTX to turn into something that's really positive for the community.
[3261.30 --> 3262.30]  Creators Summit.
[3262.30 --> 3269.30]  Because they get to like meet all these people. But I also, Roman last year, wait, why is he not on here? I'm pretty sure he's coming.
[3269.30 --> 3280.30]  Dair Bauer. Yeah, I'm like 90% sure that he's coming. Anyway, one of the critiques he had last year was that he felt like there were so many great opportunities to collab with people, but not enough time.
[3280.30 --> 3286.30]  And so, I want to create some time for people to do that and just hang out in Vancouver and like have a good time.
[3286.30 --> 3287.30]  This might be insanity.
[3287.30 --> 3288.30]  Yeah.
[3288.30 --> 3297.30]  But just saying, having the studio somewhat open to Creators for the next like two days could be pretty sweet.
[3297.30 --> 3299.30]  It might be impossible.
[3299.30 --> 3300.30]  Yeah, I mean there's so many.
[3300.30 --> 3301.30]  It might make no sense.
[3301.30 --> 3309.30]  Yeah, there's already like 15 people on the list. More. There's already 17 people on the list, plus ones that I know are coming.
[3309.30 --> 3318.30]  And aren't even on here yet. Because not all of them are comfortable with me saying they're coming. Because if something does come up at the last second, they don't want to look like a jerk.
[3318.30 --> 3319.30]  Yeah.
[3319.30 --> 3324.30]  But these are the ones that are confirmed and said they're okay with us saying that they're coming. So there's other ones that should show up.
[3324.30 --> 3328.30]  One random note is Greg Salazar is just Greg Salazar now.
[3328.30 --> 3330.30]  Oh, he's not Science Studio.
[3330.30 --> 3331.30]  Yeah.
[3331.30 --> 3333.30]  I screwed it up. Sorry, Greg.
[3333.30 --> 3334.30]  Previously known as.
[3334.30 --> 3338.30]  Yeah, the YouTuber formerly known as Science Studio.
[3338.30 --> 3339.30]  Yeah.
[3339.30 --> 3340.30]  All right. Never mind.
[3340.30 --> 3341.30]  Yeah.
[3341.30 --> 3344.30]  All right. What else we got here?
[3344.30 --> 3347.30]  Will you guys sign up for Starlink Internet once it becomes available?
[3347.30 --> 3350.30]  Could be a game changer in Canada.
[3350.30 --> 3352.30]  Latency shouldn't be horrible.
[3352.30 --> 3354.30]  It won't be a game changer here.
[3354.30 --> 3359.30]  Yeah, not in like the, okay, Canada is not all just like people living in huts.
[3359.30 --> 3365.30]  We're almost all congregated right along the border with the US at the very bottom.
[3365.30 --> 3366.30]  Yeah.
[3366.30 --> 3371.30]  But I mean, I would probably give it a one month just so that I could try it out.
[3371.30 --> 3372.30]  I would try it.
[3372.30 --> 3373.30]  Yeah.
[3373.30 --> 3374.30]  Yep.
[3374.30 --> 3375.30]  Okay.
[3375.30 --> 3376.30]  Okay.
[3376.30 --> 3377.30]  Care by Volvo launched in 2018.
[3377.30 --> 3379.30]  Audi Select launched in late 2018.
[3379.30 --> 3382.30]  Nissan isn't even close to the first.
[3382.30 --> 3383.30]  Yes, you're right.
[3383.30 --> 3384.30]  You're absolutely right.
[3384.30 --> 3389.30]  It was just that it had, it was just serendipitous that it happened like the week after we discussed
[3389.30 --> 3390.30]  it.
[3390.30 --> 3391.30]  I actually didn't even know that.
[3391.30 --> 3396.30]  I knew about the Volvo one, but not the Audi one because I don't think it's here anyway.
[3396.30 --> 3401.30]  Greg Yarman says, have you seen the Meat Canyon video about tech YouTubers?
[3401.30 --> 3402.30]  Yes, I have.
[3402.30 --> 3407.30]  I actually tried to leave a comment on it, but my comment was disabled for whatever reason.
[3407.30 --> 3410.30]  So it doesn't, no one can see it.
[3410.30 --> 3412.30]  It's like shadow, shadow blocked.
[3412.30 --> 3414.30]  Oh, that looks terrifying.
[3414.30 --> 3417.30]  It's pretty awful actually.
[3417.30 --> 3418.30]  Yeah.
[3418.30 --> 3419.30]  It's, it's a thing.
[3419.30 --> 3426.30]  Um, I think it's supposed to be me and I basically stuff an infant child into a blender
[3426.30 --> 3432.30]  and then I try to power the computer with the infant child juice.
[3432.30 --> 3434.30]  Uh, I'm sharing your screen right now.
[3434.30 --> 3436.30]  Uh, that might not be a good idea.
[3436.30 --> 3439.30]  So, yeah, there's, there's that.
[3439.30 --> 3440.30]  You might want to, you might want to turn that off.
[3440.30 --> 3443.30]  Yeah, realistically, I don't think they're going to get that mad.
[3443.30 --> 3444.30]  So.
[3444.30 --> 3445.30]  Oh my.
[3445.30 --> 3446.30]  Yeah.
[3446.30 --> 3448.30]  That's a whole, that's a whole thing that happened.
[3448.30 --> 3449.30]  Uh, I did watch it.
[3449.30 --> 3451.30]  I, it was pretty weird.
[3451.30 --> 3452.30]  Um.
[3452.30 --> 3453.30]  Okay.
[3453.30 --> 3455.30]  There's one thing that I found kind of funny, but.
[3455.30 --> 3456.30]  Yeah.
[3456.30 --> 3458.30]  Uh, oh yeah.
[3458.30 --> 3459.30]  Okay.
[3459.30 --> 3460.30]  Uh, yeah.
[3460.30 --> 3462.30]  There's some other, there's some other Easter eggs like that.
[3462.30 --> 3463.30]  Uh, 1991 shadow heart.
[3463.30 --> 3465.30]  The way you were talking about fiber internet.
[3465.30 --> 3467.30]  That's literally Australian NBN.
[3467.30 --> 3472.30]  $10,600 minimum to get a fiber connection when the node is less than a hundred meters from
[3472.30 --> 3473.30]  your front door.
[3473.30 --> 3474.30]  Help us line.
[3474.30 --> 3475.30]  That's your only hope.
[3475.30 --> 3476.30]  There's nothing I can do for you.
[3476.30 --> 3477.30]  Yeah, Australia is just screwed up.
[3477.30 --> 3481.30]  Uh, like we too are a large sparsely populated country.
[3481.30 --> 3485.30]  Um, I'm just, I'm just like so glad that I have fiber at my house now.
[3485.30 --> 3489.30]  Now I can just be like, la la la, these problems don't exist.
[3489.30 --> 3491.30]  I have fiber, yay.
[3491.30 --> 3494.30]  But I was, I was very angry about it before.
[3494.30 --> 3499.30]  I was like, why is, why is there a plan with, you know, 300 megabit down and quite literally
[3499.30 --> 3501.30]  like 10 megabit or 15 up.
[3501.30 --> 3502.30]  Why?
[3502.30 --> 3503.30]  Please.
[3503.30 --> 3504.30]  No.
[3504.30 --> 3505.30]  All right.
[3505.30 --> 3506.30]  So that's it for the WAN show.
[3506.30 --> 3508.30]  Thank you very much for watching you guys.
[3508.30 --> 3509.30]  We will see you again next week.
[3509.30 --> 3511.30]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3511.30 --> 3512.30]  Nick is back for some reason.
[3512.30 --> 3513.30]  Oh, I'm.
[3513.30 --> 3514.30]  I need to.
[3514.30 --> 3515.30]  Yeah.
[3515.30 --> 3516.30]  Oh, okay.
[3516.30 --> 3517.30]  Oh wait.
[3517.30 --> 3518.30]  Is that tickets?
[3518.30 --> 3519.30]  What are you guys seeing?
[3519.30 --> 3520.30]  It's a comedy show.
[3520.30 --> 3521.30]  Oh, fun.
[3521.30 --> 3522.30]  Yeah.
[3522.30 --> 3523.30]  All right.
[3523.30 --> 3524.30]  Well, you guys enjoy that.
[3524.30 --> 3525.30]  Have a good time.
[3525.30 --> 3526.30]  All right.
[3526.30 --> 3527.30]  See you guys.
[3527.30 --> 3528.30]  Bye.
[3528.30 --> 3533.30]  Wait, wait.
[3533.30 --> 3540.30]  LTT network Minecraft server.
[3540.30 --> 3544.30]  MC dot LTT dot GG.
[3544.30 --> 3549.30]  So yes, the Minecraft server is finally live.
[3549.30 --> 3553.30]  So it's soft launched on Monday, excuse me, Tuesday, because Monday was a holiday.
[3553.30 --> 3559.30]  And we are going to be doing kind of a bigger hard launch announcement in a little bit.
[3559.30 --> 3560.30]  But yes.
[3560.30 --> 3563.30]  Is that was that donated from Langley pressure washing?
[3563.30 --> 3564.30]  Yes.
[3564.30 --> 3565.30]  All right.
[3565.30 --> 3567.30]  I mean, you know, that's a chill.
[3567.30 --> 3568.30]  Cool.
[3568.30 --> 3571.30]  Maybe we need to get our building pressure washed.
[3571.30 --> 3572.30]  I don't know.
[3572.30 --> 3577.30]  Maybe that subliminal marketing is going to work pretty good there.
[3577.30 --> 3578.30]  Okay.
[3578.30 --> 3579.30]  I actually need to go.
[3579.30 --> 3580.30]  All right.
[3580.30 --> 3581.30]  See you.
