[0.00 --> 9.12]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to the wan show this is what it looks like when luke and i try to start
[9.12 --> 17.88]  half an hour early yeah we start on time it's uh yeah it's that's quite the quite the strat we got
[17.88 --> 24.72]  there am i right yeah absolutely yep so i mean basically basically i just didn't want to be
[24.72 --> 32.06]  streaming until like 7 30 today because i was i was i streamed for six hours in a row yesterday
[32.06 --> 37.48]  uh rebuilding my machine so it's it started out as an innocent enough project i was gonna
[37.48 --> 44.34]  like i i had wanted to just do like a hey um you know you're bored you're stuck at home you know
[44.34 --> 49.50]  why not tear down and rebuild your computer for fun and profit right sure like that was kind of the
[49.50 --> 54.68]  intention and i i opened up with a story about how that was actually how i learned to build a computer
[54.68 --> 61.12]  was taking the machine that someone built for me and then tearing it down and putting it back
[61.12 --> 65.64]  together and making sure that it still ran that was like that was my first scratch build was one
[65.64 --> 72.16]  that i had just like hours before watched someone else build for me and so i kind of wanted to talk
[72.16 --> 77.02]  about that and while i was at it i wanted to fix some small problems that have been bothering me
[77.02 --> 82.62]  about my build for the last uh you know four and a half years ever since i finished it i broke my power
[82.62 --> 86.86]  button when i was installing my radiator i wanted to fix that my radiators it turns out weren't even
[86.86 --> 91.92]  mounted to anything they were just sitting there so because the screw holes hadn't lined up correctly
[91.92 --> 96.76]  on the case that we had manufactured because we sent them flawed plans so that we wanted to fix that
[96.76 --> 102.08]  my power supply didn't uh didn't mount properly so whenever you'd plug in a cable it would like push
[102.08 --> 107.16]  the power supply in and like wrench on the screws so i wanted to fix that and then i was like oh you
[107.16 --> 111.42]  know maybe i'll go hard line water cooling while i'm at it so i decided to do that six hours later i was
[111.42 --> 117.86]  still i was still streaming but the good news is i am actually bringing this show to you right now
[117.86 --> 124.74]  from that machine it is working fine just fine and i even upgraded my memory today because people were
[124.74 --> 136.20]  shaming me oh i got i got system memory shamed yesterday because because i had the you know the
[136.20 --> 147.78]  audacity to run you know this plebeian corsair dominator memory that runs at a mere uh 2666 megahertz
[147.78 --> 158.92]  cl15 okay people were people were real unhappy about that because i am running a ryzen um 3900x and well
[158.92 --> 165.16]  linus um actually ryzen really benefits a lot from faster memory i'm like i know but it benefits
[165.16 --> 170.92]  it benefits a lot from faster memory in the same way that like you know your car benefits from
[170.92 --> 179.10]  going and getting it tuned at a shop it's like yes yes it it does but for 99 of people that difference
[179.10 --> 186.36]  is not something that is noticeable and or meaningful so and it will be fine it doesn't matter it doesn't
[186.36 --> 193.58]  matter but it's out so it's out now it's gone it is very old memory served me very well this is gen 6
[193.58 --> 199.68]  so this was optimized for like the 6700k in terms of like the sub timing optimization stuff like that
[199.68 --> 204.94]  that xmp profile is basically worthless but i'm running some some new g skill rgb stuff now it's all
[204.94 --> 210.44]  good and you know what else is good the show that we've got for you guys today we've got uh we've
[210.44 --> 218.54]  actually got a lot of good news today nvidia's ampere a100 has been announced freaking exciting
[218.54 --> 225.40]  we're getting a whole new graphics card architecture also unreal engine 5 got demoed and it looks
[225.40 --> 231.30]  absolutely jaw-dropping i took all the good stuff so why don't you go with the totally silly thing
[231.30 --> 238.10]  the totally silly thing you mean lg working on a new dual screen phone that swivels horizontally
[238.10 --> 243.94]  at least we have jaw-dropping i think we might have similar reactions yeah yeah i love it tsmc
[243.94 --> 252.86]  is potentially allegedly maybe planning to uh open a fab in the u.s by 2023 yeah but who said this
[252.86 --> 259.36]  i don't i don't know okay well can we can talk we can talk more about that we can talk more about
[259.36 --> 261.36]  that later in the meantime let's roll that intro
[261.36 --> 271.84]  space raisin says exactly on time proof of pre-recording
[271.84 --> 279.56]  hi twitch why are you going on why are you going on youtube sending a super chat to say hi to twitch
[279.56 --> 284.46]  that doesn't even make any sense no you want to say hi to twitch you just go on twitch say hi to twitch
[284.46 --> 289.08]  no one no one's stopping you from doing it all right why don't we jump right into our very first
[289.08 --> 297.38]  topic of the day this was post by igor mp on the forum and in an announcement at gtc that totally
[297.38 --> 305.44]  didn't rip off our kitchen set did you see that no i didn't jensen jensen he ripped off our jam okay so
[305.44 --> 311.98]  he was in his kitchen working on computer stuff not wearing a leather jacket okay who else do you know
[311.98 --> 316.66]  who else do you know who hangs out in a kitchen doing computer stuff and who doesn't wear a leather
[316.66 --> 324.36]  jacket clearly but he wait he is wearing a leather jacket is he wearing a leather jacket in that video
[324.36 --> 334.08]  he is not yeah no he is no he isn't uh jensen cooking hold on hold on cooking where where is it
[334.08 --> 340.86]  no no that's not leather that's not leather that's a puffy jacket what that's a puffy jacket
[340.86 --> 346.68]  i'm watching the same video he's 100 wearing a leather jacket i'm i'm bringing i'm bringing the
[346.68 --> 352.12]  people in i'm bringing the people in they're going to validate this for me 2020 keynote part one he's
[352.12 --> 357.10]  wearing a leather jacket window capture no no i'm talking about i'm talking about before that okay i'm
[357.10 --> 360.94]  talking about this one where he's cooking up something in his kitchen or whatever see he's
[360.94 --> 368.98]  not wearing a leather jacket see there's a freaking fancy is that stove this is what i'm talking i know
[368.98 --> 376.92]  right what the heck nice nice kitchen hey bro look at that look at that gorgeous kitchen look at that
[376.92 --> 385.82]  gorgeous graphics card he's taken out of there it's beautiful i love it my um hello peasants let me get
[385.82 --> 393.98]  my wares yeah i know right anyway so he's so i'm just saying that i think that my case for him ripping
[393.98 --> 404.16]  off my likeness for profit is at least as strong as lindsey lohan's against rockstar okay sure yeah i'm
[404.16 --> 411.54]  sold 100 i'm on board i would join this class action i don't know i don't know if you guys remember
[411.54 --> 417.36]  this but this was this was a whole thing back in absolutely grand theft which grand theft auto was
[417.36 --> 422.16]  that again five grand theft auto five there you go so this was a whole thing she was all like yep
[422.16 --> 429.44]  this is clearly this is clearly ripping off my likeness and uh she tried to sue them for i can't
[429.44 --> 435.58]  remember if it was just money or whatever anyway she lost and i would and i would lose two and that's
[435.58 --> 440.66]  okay because at least to make me feel better i've got some great news about new graphics cards
[440.66 --> 449.96]  so here we go uh ampere a100 is an sxm4 based add-in card destined for the data center and
[449.96 --> 454.48]  supercomputers and this is probably a little disappointing to the gamers out there especially
[454.48 --> 460.94]  given the arguably misleading title on today's wan show but we're actually referring to something else
[460.94 --> 467.70]  not this that's right there's there's more and it's true um so disappointing to those folks is
[467.70 --> 474.30]  the fact that this is not a desktop based debut for ampere in the form of the rtx 3000 series that's
[474.30 --> 480.82]  what we're assuming it's going to be called but it does give us at least some hints as to what we can
[480.82 --> 487.00]  expect from an ampere based gpu so there's a few things that we can talk about with the a100 first it
[487.00 --> 493.06]  can efficiently scale to thousands of gpus or be partitioned into seven gpu instances using
[493.06 --> 501.68]  multi-instance gpu or i love this mig technology you want to use some mig technology there luke
[501.68 --> 508.12]  uh yeah dude nvidia is claiming a six times performance improvement out of the box in
[508.12 --> 513.68]  burt deep learning training over previous generation volta gpus and up to 20 times higher performance in
[513.68 --> 519.00]  tensor float precision workloads with an additional 2x boost using mixed precision and 16-bit floating point
[519.00 --> 526.44]  and you know what even like two weeks ago i probably would have said g nvidia thanks for
[526.44 --> 530.08]  you know what let's let's say a month ago let's say a month ago i probably would have said g nvidia
[530.08 --> 535.84]  thanks for all the ai bull that you're putting into your consumer graphics cards that i honestly have
[535.84 --> 543.94]  no use for like where's my frames per second right but in the last three weeks alone i have seen
[543.94 --> 549.58]  let me let me just try and think i have seen three or it's not three weeks whatever the last month or
[549.58 --> 556.92]  so i have seen three very compelling uses for their ai on the desktop first of all dlss 2.0 is way better
[556.92 --> 564.94]  than dlss gen 1 it actually doesn't suck now like you can run a game at a lower resolution and it will
[564.94 --> 571.78]  fake upscale itself in a way that is shockingly convincing number one right there number two i watched
[571.78 --> 578.72]  them use their deep learning upsampling on the shield to make 1080p content look not quite native 4k
[578.72 --> 586.80]  but boy is it close to the point where you know if it was i don't know it's like this weird fine line
[586.80 --> 593.10]  because there's the people who would not never notice the difference between 1080 and 4k anyway and
[593.10 --> 598.16]  then there's the people who would notice the difference between 4k and this upscaled stuff and i would say
[598.16 --> 604.22]  that nvidia's upsampling is going to appeal to kind of 80 of the people who could tell the difference
[604.22 --> 609.96]  but aren't like that sensitive if that kind of makes sense do you catch my drift so you're it's not going
[609.96 --> 613.54]  to make any difference for the people who just couldn't tell it all anyway but for everyone who
[613.54 --> 617.32]  could tell i think you could take most of that chunk and say yeah they're gonna they're gonna be
[617.32 --> 624.56]  convinced by their ai upscaling and then the big one is of course rtx voice now rtx voice absolutely
[624.56 --> 631.40]  diarrhea'd all over itself for my stream yesterday but i'm not gonna blame rtx voice for that because
[631.40 --> 636.16]  i think it might have actually been to do with the fact that i was running my rtx gpu in a thunderbolt
[636.16 --> 640.84]  enclosure that also had usb ports on it that i also had additional capture devices running through
[640.84 --> 646.58]  because blah blah blah long story i didn't have enough thunderbolt ports and i had too many capture
[646.58 --> 652.46]  devices for the stream um so you know that was a problem but rtx voice the way that it blocks out
[652.46 --> 659.58]  background noise absolutely freaking fantastic and i am i am legitimately excited to see what kind of
[659.58 --> 666.66]  ai tricks nvidia can pull out of their butts and uh work into my desktop experience
[666.66 --> 674.02]  uh what else is going on here uh additional 2x boost using mixed precision and 16-bit floating point
[674.02 --> 678.60]  blah blah blah nvidia also claims that for other high performance compute applications new double
[678.60 --> 684.26]  precision tensor cores enable a reduction of a 10-hour simulation on volta to four hours on ampere
[684.26 --> 689.88]  and compared to volta ampere has 35 percent more CUDA cores now that is going to translate directly to
[689.88 --> 694.82]  gamers 78 higher memory bandwidth that's going to be good for gamers double the nvlink links
[694.82 --> 701.94]  probably less applicable for gamers sli is dead and is on the 7 nanometer tsmc node so we should
[701.94 --> 709.18]  expect potentially higher clock speeds and a better efficiency um let's see if there's just anything
[709.18 --> 714.10]  else that you guys will actually kind of care about here the expansion of tensor core capabilities
[714.10 --> 718.64]  blah blah blah better deep learning capabilities oh yeah okay so anthony threw in some some commentary
[718.64 --> 724.24]  about how yes this better ai could mean more technologies like deep learning super sampling but i
[724.24 --> 731.04]  already i already talked about that which is cool so luke place your bet how long is it going to be
[731.04 --> 736.96]  before we get a desktop ampere graphics card and you're ready to upgrade to touring because
[736.96 --> 744.48]  everybody's offloading their tourings holiday you think you think holiday this year i you know i
[744.48 --> 749.92]  i was really i i don't know wow you have so much confidence because i i was kind of all over the place
[749.92 --> 756.28]  on this one i was thinking either like a month from now because nvidia has done that before like gone
[756.28 --> 762.48]  new gpu new gpu new gpu new gpu like all the way down the family kind of four to six weeks apart
[762.48 --> 769.14]  they've they've pulled that move um but then i was also kind of thinking well they don't have a
[769.14 --> 776.68]  competitor at all right now like they could just wait till next year for all they care realistically
[776.68 --> 783.68]  so so you say holiday do you care care to name it care to name a month i want to hear it what month
[783.68 --> 792.90]  november you say november okay so are they going to try to hit why would you try to hit holiday
[792.90 --> 797.18]  why what's your motivation you're jensen you're jensen huang you're wearing a leather jacket
[797.18 --> 803.10]  okay okay okay go you know put yourself in character yeah incredibly beautiful stonework
[803.10 --> 810.46]  around my incredible stove behind me yeah glowing in the sunlight uh and i'm telling my team that i
[810.46 --> 819.70]  think we should wait for holiday because uh no competition right now and uh the covid grab to buy
[819.70 --> 825.90]  pc parts i haven't looked into it but i'm assuming it's starting to slow down a bit um and now we might
[825.90 --> 832.80]  be settling into a lower funds across the board yeah state for covid so people like the the purchasing
[832.80 --> 836.86]  of these parts might be going down i'm not sure these are these are assumptions that i'm making
[836.86 --> 842.20]  right now sure he would know though just for painting the scene sure yeah yeah yeah yeah he's you're in the
[842.20 --> 846.96]  character you got to get in character yeah yeah yeah um and then i would i would aim for this holiday
[846.96 --> 854.18]  not for next year because uh i mean you might as well yeah you can kind of line up with the the
[854.18 --> 859.84]  early enough purchases for people that are going to be buying relatively early for potential christmas
[859.84 --> 864.28]  stuff um and i think people are a little bit looser with their wallets around that time anyways can i
[864.28 --> 870.04]  give my guess for why i now that you've said holiday i 100 agree with you that that's what they're they're
[870.04 --> 879.24]  gonna do okay i think i think he wants to crap on the upcoming console launches because he's already
[879.24 --> 885.22]  talked some smack we've heard jensen talk smack about how like yeah that performance tier has
[885.22 --> 892.84]  existed for a while it's called an rtx 2080 lol um yeah i i think there's some more smack talk we're
[892.84 --> 897.24]  going to talk about later on in this show but yeah honestly that's a big one too yeah i would i would
[897.24 --> 901.74]  definitely i'm on board with that i think he's the kind of character you know he's got it remember he's
[901.74 --> 906.60]  got his leather jacket okay i think he's the kind of character that would want to get on stage and say
[906.60 --> 912.84]  hey cool cute console that's nice good job um you know if you want something twice as powerful
[912.84 --> 919.58]  team green you know suckas he would absolutely love to do that yeah yeah i'm sure he'd be into that
[919.58 --> 926.08]  that's some strong logic i like it i do have a quick super chat that i need to read um the real smiley
[926.08 --> 932.44]  says don't waste your money on a super chat it will not be acknowledged even a 50 one i did it to test
[932.44 --> 937.18]  to see on his last live stream first time i've ever paid money to comment lol how dumb of me you're
[937.18 --> 942.70]  welcome so yeah i didn't see your super chat but i did see that so now there you go there's your
[942.70 --> 947.94]  shout out smart guy how you feel now all right let's uh let's move on to our next topic here
[947.94 --> 956.44]  um unreal engine 5 demoed want to give us the run through here this is super exciting
[956.44 --> 964.32]  it's it's kind of long actually there's there's a bunch of stuff going on i i suggest you you watch
[964.32 --> 969.26]  the video i will say uh engine videos unless you're watching them with somewhat of a trained eye
[969.26 --> 976.08]  uh might not mean a ton but it looks really nice so might as well check it out uh it's it's epic
[976.08 --> 983.18]  games released this footage and it is specifically from it is an unreal engine 5 running on a playstation
[983.18 --> 989.08]  5 console that's the like important flex that's going on here and this is very cool i say this
[989.08 --> 994.84]  every time i'm going to say it again this is very cool for console players as well because or sorry
[994.84 --> 1000.12]  for pc players as well because the further consoles push things will look better on pc yeah even when
[1000.12 --> 1004.92]  like like every time a new console comes out they get really close or surpass the the price point
[1004.92 --> 1010.24]  value that pcs are going to be at at that time but then over time pcs supersede by a huge amount
[1010.24 --> 1016.46]  100 and and games are just going to look better in general so this is fantastic uh i'm going to read
[1016.46 --> 1021.88]  directly from notes here for a second visualized micro polygon geometry oh we've had a lot of fun
[1021.88 --> 1027.68]  word combinations in this land show so far uh which allows developers to use film quality meshes as
[1027.68 --> 1033.10]  sources and you can see in the demo things do look very very good uh which with each comprising
[1033.10 --> 1039.90]  hundreds of millions of polygons um they talk about nanite scales lots of lots of ability to put
[1039.90 --> 1044.50]  huge amounts of polygons and and tons of varied objects across the screen at the same time
[1044.50 --> 1051.32]  uh developers no longer need to bake details to normal maps in order to maximize detail um
[1051.32 --> 1056.74]  this better overall global illumination they give some examples of that in the video as well
[1056.74 --> 1061.88]  it allows fully dynamic multi-balanced lighting that immediately reacts to scene and light changes
[1061.88 --> 1065.28]  that lighting looks incredible can i just i'm gonna let you finish but like
[1065.28 --> 1071.66]  wow it looks really good you want to demo it you can i've got it up right now okay yeah they're
[1071.66 --> 1077.50]  they're watching they're watching huzzah um the lighting is the lighting demo is really cool uh it
[1077.50 --> 1082.40]  can benefit from developers trying to improve their games as well as uh to make the final title more
[1082.40 --> 1086.90]  reactive to player inputs which is great allows developers to iterate in real time without having
[1086.90 --> 1092.60]  to wait for light map bakes to finish saving huge amounts of time it probably does uh this new
[1092.60 --> 1097.00]  technology is not a next gen exclusive and will scale to work on a variety of both old and new
[1097.00 --> 1103.62]  platforms also cool especially with the uh the new xbox thing that makes it so that you can buy a game
[1103.62 --> 1108.24]  and it's available on a variety of platforms so if you're sticking with your current console for a
[1108.24 --> 1113.08]  little while and you buy these new games when you move to your next con like it should the new games
[1113.08 --> 1116.04]  should look better on your current console and when you move to the next console you'll be able to
[1116.04 --> 1121.84]  keep your games it's nice little combination uh but the spiciness i kind of plowed through a lot of that
[1121.84 --> 1127.52]  to the spiciness this is the the fun part to discuss on the lan show um they are claiming the
[1127.52 --> 1134.48]  new ssds on the next gen consoles will allow huge complex large-scale worlds that will be streamed
[1134.48 --> 1139.48]  into the machine in incredible detail without you really noticing things popping in in the traditional
[1139.48 --> 1145.52]  way that you would yeah and sweeney said the storage architecture on playstation 4 in playstation 5
[1145.52 --> 1151.20]  is far ahead of anything you can buy on any pc for any amount of money right now
[1151.20 --> 1158.02]  really great to see that sort of innovation that's going to help drive future pcs they're going to and
[1158.02 --> 1164.04]  then this part i i was trying to cross-reference this quote and i haven't watched this part of the
[1164.04 --> 1171.18]  video yet um but it says they're going to see this thing ship and realize oh wow m2 ssds i need to
[1171.18 --> 1178.94]  catch up with it we have m2 ssd again i haven't watched that part of the video and i need to
[1178.94 --> 1184.06]  need to find that exact comment and i've been trying to reference more comments about this
[1184.06 --> 1192.62]  on the future uh on the internet since then but yeah the ps5 uses a pcie 4.0 ssd that reaches speeds
[1192.62 --> 1200.86]  of 5.5 gigabytes per second i'm back what'd you get sorry i was gone i was gone i was gone i was uh
[1201.50 --> 1206.78]  oh hold on first of all first of all i just i want to pull up the demo again for a second here
[1206.78 --> 1214.62]  because this is just so mind-blowing okay so you can see with the the global illumination so cool to be
[1214.62 --> 1222.38]  clear global illumination is not the same thing as uh ray tracing necessarily so you can have light
[1222.38 --> 1230.14]  bounce without necessarily being photon by photon but this is so cool so they show this is the light
[1230.14 --> 1238.62]  source and then basically everything else is lit by that light source which is that hard light from
[1238.62 --> 1243.58]  the sun bouncing that's how it works in the real world i remember talking to brandon about this for
[1243.58 --> 1249.58]  a while um or a while back when we were building our uh our set at the office that's kind of set up like a
[1249.58 --> 1256.14]  like a condo and i was like brandon why can't we just have like a handful of lights set up and then
[1256.14 --> 1262.70]  you know kind of like if i was just in my house um you could just kind of have those ones be the kind
[1262.70 --> 1267.02]  of the base lighting and then we can just add as needed but it's like kind of ready to go at any time
[1267.02 --> 1272.78]  he's like well the issue is that because we have no way of routing you know the the power of the sun
[1272.78 --> 1278.14]  into our studio unless you want to buy like you know 2 000 watt lights and point them through the
[1278.14 --> 1283.82]  windows so that they actually like bounce off the floor and walls and and globally illuminate the
[1283.82 --> 1287.18]  place you're just not going to get it and you're going to end up with all kinds of other issues that
[1287.18 --> 1290.86]  i didn't care as much about like oh you're gonna you know the color of your floor is going to color
[1290.86 --> 1295.02]  the light and blah blah blah i was like yeah i mean we're just looking for sort of like a baseline here
[1295.02 --> 1300.22]  but anyway that's how real lighting works and that's why it looks so natural and that's why it's so much
[1300.22 --> 1304.22]  work to recreate that effect with studio lighting because you have to have this understanding of
[1304.22 --> 1308.46]  light and the way it bounces and the way that it interacts with things that um you know i had never
[1308.46 --> 1314.14]  i just never really thought about um from a film perspective anyway you know a number of years ago
[1314.14 --> 1321.50]  when we were first talking about this and so seeing it done this way dynamically um
[1323.10 --> 1327.50]  in a demo that is actually running on what will be production hardware that you can buy for
[1327.50 --> 1337.42]  presumably console pricing in a couple of you know quarters here is just mind bending um with that
[1337.42 --> 1343.98]  said you know why do you know why does someone like tim sweeney like how many billions of dollars is
[1343.98 --> 1351.02]  he worth like what why does he need to why does he need to say stuff that's just like demonstrably false
[1351.02 --> 1360.86]  you know like how fast is that how fast is the storage of the ps5 5.5 gigabytes per second 5.5 gigabytes per second
[1360.86 --> 1366.62]  all right so there's a little um there's a little uh video platform you might have heard of it it's called floatplane
[1366.62 --> 1371.98]  um yeah there's a there's a team working on that over there good good people good people you know
[1371.98 --> 1378.86]  it's a little slow but they're good people they're nice people you know um so over on that platform there's this creator
[1378.86 --> 1383.82]  he he didn't have a beard before he's got a beard now the community is kind of divided on whether he should keep it
[1384.46 --> 1390.06]  decent decent enough guy though um he uploaded a video really click-baity title i can't stand that
[1390.06 --> 1396.38]  about this guy it's very frustrating and uh the video is called this is 50 times faster than your pc
[1396.38 --> 1403.98]  holy um and he's got this ssd that according to tim sweeney doesn't exist for any amount of money
[1404.86 --> 1409.58]  and it's just it's crazy because because there there he is hold on a second here i can i can
[1409.58 --> 1414.14]  screen share with you guys look look at this guy look at this beard look at this stupid face he makes
[1414.14 --> 1419.82]  in his thumbnail it's awful you've got that question mark in there so so here's this guy right and he's
[1419.82 --> 1430.30]  holding it just like that that's a thing that tim sweeney said is not real um but like it's it's so
[1430.30 --> 1434.70]  funny because there it is look it's in his hand actually no no no that's a different one that's
[1434.70 --> 1438.86]  a slower one look he threw that one away and that one's also faster than the one tim sweeney said
[1438.86 --> 1445.34]  doesn't exist isn't that weird like why do they do this you know you've already you've already got
[1445.34 --> 1450.06]  enough money to buy the earth and all the heavens why do you need to sell out to sony to just say stuff
[1450.06 --> 1456.54]  that's just not true at all um also also you know that guy i happen to actually know him pretty well
[1456.54 --> 1466.62]  um he dropped off in my house this a little while ago this is an ssd that is not only not only uh as
[1466.62 --> 1476.70]  fast as the playstation 5's ssd but is actually at 1500 megabytes oh excuse me 15 000 megabytes a second
[1477.26 --> 1485.02]  double the speed and yet here it is so that guy's got one okay actually he's got two i've got one right
[1485.02 --> 1493.34]  here here's another one so that is three now that is three pc ssds that are faster for any amount of
[1493.34 --> 1498.94]  money i didn't say they were cheap faster than the playstation 5 storage system look at that what a
[1498.94 --> 1506.06]  fine what a funny thing would you look at that isn't that funny how that works they're saying 5.5
[1506.06 --> 1511.82]  gigabytes per second read and typical eight to nine gigabytes per second compressed
[1511.82 --> 1521.42]  okay still slower just reiterating anyway to be very clear uh was there anything else that you
[1521.42 --> 1526.22]  wanted to talk about with the unreal 5 demo because i wanted to talk about the playstation 5 storage
[1526.22 --> 1530.14]  for sure some people in the chat say i know i blew through some of the earlier stuff i just wanted to
[1530.14 --> 1536.86]  get to the controversial statement yeah uh someone said global illumination has existed in the past yes
[1536.86 --> 1543.02]  it absolutely has absolutely has it's a a new globalization global illumination solution yes
[1543.66 --> 1548.22]  i remember i mean global illumination has been something that the gaming industry has been trying
[1548.22 --> 1554.86]  to conquer since well basically the gaming industry existed um you know nvidia thought their voxel based
[1554.86 --> 1560.38]  global illumination was going to take off back with maxwell uh to my knowledge that never really gained a
[1560.38 --> 1568.30]  ton of traction uh although i don't actually know how unreal engine 5 is doing it so um yeah i will i
[1568.30 --> 1573.34]  would i would definitely need to get into some deeper dives into what exactly their implementation looks
[1573.34 --> 1580.46]  like but with uh with their voxel based global illumination if i recall correctly nvidia was taking
[1580.46 --> 1586.46]  more complex objects and they were kind of having them bounce as though they were much simpler ones they
[1586.46 --> 1594.62]  like these volumetric pixels um so yes not not new like ray tracing is new ray tracing is different but
[1594.62 --> 1599.50]  global illumination is not new it's just that that particular technique for it running in real time at
[1599.50 --> 1610.30]  that level of detail with 8k textures on a playstation right that's crazy cool now i spent a fair bit of time
[1610.30 --> 1617.74]  mocking tim sweeney's statement that the storage architecture in playstation 5 is far ahead of
[1617.74 --> 1623.50]  anything you can get in a pc for any amount of money but that doesn't change that what he's saying does
[1623.50 --> 1630.86]  is um there's a kernel of truth in the misleading statement and the kernel of truth is that um compared to
[1631.50 --> 1642.94]  any pc that you would buy like off the shelf yes it is faster and compared to any mainstream pc it is
[1642.94 --> 1649.50]  much faster and will be coming in at a price that is going to uh and at a volume that is going to
[1649.50 --> 1657.18]  change the way that game developers utilize storage that's what he's trying to say even if he ended up
[1657.18 --> 1665.02]  making a really stupid statement in order to say it two thousand dollar really fancy packed uh ssds are
[1665.02 --> 1671.58]  not necessarily what most people are considering when they're building computers and technically uh we
[1671.58 --> 1680.06]  haven't been able to like fully see in action as far as far as i know the the the real capabilities
[1680.06 --> 1686.30]  because he's talking about the the architecture of the whole thing uh so like interconnects between the
[1686.30 --> 1690.86]  ram and then and the more long-term storage and everything else but you're getting a little
[1690.86 --> 1696.62]  nuanced at that point and we don't have enough data to pick out there as far as i know i'm sorry
[1696.62 --> 1703.02]  did you say two thousand dollars because uh this is more than that how much is that one uh i can't find
[1703.02 --> 1708.06]  a u.s price for it i'm not sure if it's strictly speaking available but i found a u.s listing for it
[1708.06 --> 1712.38]  that was over three thousand australian dollars i don't know exactly what the conversion is there though
[1712.38 --> 1720.22]  um anyway anyway the point is you know what he's trying to say i think is that by having so much
[1720.22 --> 1726.46]  faster storage on hand and knowing that they can count on having fast storage available on hand and
[1726.46 --> 1732.30]  remember none of this would be worth anything if microsoft wasn't also putting very fast storage in
[1732.30 --> 1738.70]  the upcoming xbox even if it's not quite as fast i mean it's all kind of a measuring contest at that
[1738.70 --> 1744.62]  point anyway um because game developers especially considering that they're both running the same cpu
[1744.62 --> 1751.10]  and gpu are not going to be you know foundationally designing their games differently if the playstation
[1751.10 --> 1758.06]  and the xbox don't both have the ability to take advantage of it and the pc too now that pc storage is
[1758.06 --> 1762.86]  and has been quite a lot faster than consoles which have been stuck with hard drives for the longest time
[1762.86 --> 1769.42]  so um so this this reliance on having this base functionality is going to change the way that they
[1769.42 --> 1775.66]  can handle things like as luke was mentioning earlier uh textures instead of having that pop in
[1775.66 --> 1782.86]  being able to load let's say for example many many more different versions of of an asset so that you can
[1782.86 --> 1787.66]  swap them out extremely quickly as you are moving towards them so that it's much less jarring you know
[1787.66 --> 1792.78]  that's just one very rudimentary example of how you could do something like that if you know you can count
[1792.78 --> 1796.78]  on very high speed storage another really cool thing that you could do if you can count on high
[1796.78 --> 1804.06]  speed storage not to mention a faster cpu is you could actually start to design games with much much
[1804.06 --> 1809.34]  faster load times because that's something that you're going to run into these days is you can have
[1809.34 --> 1814.46]  i like i could put this i could put this in my computer and most of the games that i run would
[1814.46 --> 1817.26]  still have abominable load times you want to know why
[1817.26 --> 1827.58]  yes yes oh thank you luke thank you luke it's because it's primarily no it's primarily cpu bottlenecked
[1828.70 --> 1834.38]  i'm decompressing the game assets as you're firing up a game is primarily cpu bottlenecked because
[1835.02 --> 1841.34]  it's been all about compressing that data down as much as possible to deliver it over a network for
[1841.34 --> 1847.98]  example or to squeeze it onto a console hard drive so people can install as many games as they as they
[1847.98 --> 1853.74]  can on their you know 500 gig or one terabyte drives or whatever the case may be and there has been no
[1853.74 --> 1861.66]  compelling reason to say okay um well you know what we should do then is we should uh we should uh unpack
[1861.66 --> 1866.62]  more of these assets and then we should just stream them uncompressed while the player is playing because
[1866.62 --> 1871.02]  there was no option to do that because the hard drive wasn't fast enough so you had these you had
[1871.02 --> 1875.50]  these two bottlenecks that were present you had a cpu bottleneck anytime you needed to unpack something
[1875.50 --> 1879.74]  and then you had a storage bottleneck if you decided okay you know what to heck with it i'm going to
[1879.74 --> 1883.50]  unpack it early and i'm just going to stream all the assets in well you couldn't do it anyway because
[1883.50 --> 1888.94]  a modern two and a half inch hard drive is still limited to 150 to 200 megabytes a second best case
[1888.94 --> 1895.98]  scenario so this is going to change the way that they can they can load assets into games and i don't think
[1895.98 --> 1901.10]  that crediting sony with changing the gaming industry here makes a ton of sense and his
[1901.10 --> 1906.22]  statement that there is no ssd for any amount of money that's as fast as this is really stupid
[1906.22 --> 1913.66]  because this is just this is literally wired to the cpu that's what it is it is wired directly to
[1913.66 --> 1919.74]  the pci express bus on the cpu and if you imagine for a second that sony's cpu and the playstation is
[1919.74 --> 1927.82]  not just an amd chip running pci express then you're a fool um that's all there is to it i'm gonna be
[1927.82 --> 1934.38]  i'm gonna be that guy do it one do it a little bit to do it now i was probably wrong in the pre-show
[1934.38 --> 1943.10]  when i said i was i was loud but um apparently he doesn't technically technically say it's faster
[1943.10 --> 1950.94]  far ahead okay um what does far ahead mean i don't know so if i were to say if i okay look
[1950.94 --> 1955.82]  look let's just think for a second if i were to say usain bolt usain bolt is far ahead of the other
[1955.82 --> 1963.98]  competitors on the track what does that mean okay yeah if i were to say if i were to say um you know
[1963.98 --> 1969.74]  for example that i i don't know any people who drive cars for a living so i'm gonna go with danica patrick
[1969.74 --> 1975.50]  that's the only one i'm familiar with okay if i were to say that she was far ahead of the competition
[1975.50 --> 1983.98]  what what would that what would that mean far ahead in endorsements far i mean he's probably far ahead
[1983.98 --> 1989.90]  in endorsements right now yeah i think he's doing all right but yeah i don't know it's it's it's we'll
[1989.90 --> 1996.54]  we'll have to see what it actually translates into i don't suspect much uh i don't suspect anyone's going to
[1996.54 --> 2004.38]  to load up a pc and go oh or a ps5 and go like oh wow how am i going to catch up with this i don't
[2004.38 --> 2010.46]  think that's going to happen yeah me neither but but i mean hopefully it's there hopefully they make
[2010.46 --> 2017.74]  leaps and stripes leaks leaps and strides in terms of architecture and then if they do anything uh that
[2017.74 --> 2023.42]  that's like really transformative with their memory architecture hopefully it comes to pc yeah i mean it
[2023.42 --> 2027.98]  may not be possible i mean there there is an advantage to running your own operating system i
[2027.98 --> 2034.86]  mean we showed uh we showed when we fired up our new one x storage server that just because you're
[2034.86 --> 2040.06]  running the same ssds wired into the same pci express bus doesn't mean that you get the same error-free
[2040.06 --> 2047.02]  operation um from one operating system to another one so it is possible that sony will be looking at a
[2047.02 --> 2052.86]  significant performance advantage with their implementation based on the software side of
[2052.86 --> 2058.54]  things but i guess what i'm what i was mostly trying to say in my tongue-in-cheek way is that
[2059.34 --> 2064.30]  if they're 30 ahead that's not going to result in a 30 difference in how these games are going to run
[2064.30 --> 2070.38]  on the playstation um foundationally everything is going solid state which is going to be a huge
[2070.38 --> 2073.90]  advantage but past that we're going to be looking at a point of diminishing returns
[2073.90 --> 2082.54]  they they they talked about um how they they worked to remove any bottlenecks that current ssds have
[2082.54 --> 2086.78]  and like all this other kind of stuff and and that that's fantastic and i hope it works for them but
[2086.78 --> 2097.26]  um yeah i i think i'm on i'm on linus's side with the with the overall i don't know about the like oh wow
[2097.26 --> 2102.54]  how am i gonna catch up on pc there's no way i could buy anything that's this good meanwhile microsoft
[2102.54 --> 2105.18]  doesn't even consider them a competitor anymore sick burn
[2108.38 --> 2113.50]  well what do you what do you think i way way ahead of everything yeah with with minimal information
[2114.46 --> 2120.46]  xbox one x or ps5 um like who do you think is going to win the war this time i think it's relatively
[2120.46 --> 2126.14]  obvious that playstation won last time i think sony goes in with the momentum on their side uh you know
[2126.14 --> 2134.38]  because i mean yeah yeah we can we can talk about the ssd and the playstation 5 or the graphics card
[2134.38 --> 2142.78]  in the xbox one series x all day but at the end of it all what makes someone choose one console
[2142.78 --> 2148.62]  versus another one okay i'm gonna i'm gonna put down three things and i'm gonna see if you say the same
[2148.62 --> 2154.54]  three things okay hold on hold on hold on you can see it how can you see it i covered it because i'm
[2154.54 --> 2159.26]  on the same dock as you oh okay don't don't look at it don't look at it covered it with my hand
[2159.26 --> 2164.86]  okay well don't look at it okay uh i was like wow am i screen sharing right now because i'm looking at
[2164.86 --> 2169.82]  the obs window i'm not screen sharing right now are you magic are you magic okay so you probably saw
[2169.82 --> 2174.62]  the first one but you were gonna say that anyway so go ahead hit me hit me what are your three items
[2174.62 --> 2181.18]  that determine which console you buy i said games exclusives i'm kind of bundling those as one thing
[2181.18 --> 2191.42]  yeah uh bundles slash price which i'm also bundling is kind of one thing and then friends okay so i had
[2191.42 --> 2197.18]  exclusives whatever your friend group buys so we were overlapping on two of them and then i actually had
[2197.18 --> 2204.06]  controller as a major determinant of which console you would prefer because there's so many games that are
[2204.06 --> 2209.42]  cross-platform now that i could see people choosing one or the other assuming pricing and bundles are
[2209.42 --> 2214.54]  similar based on well you know i really prefer the xbox or i really prefer the playstation controller
[2214.54 --> 2222.70]  bundles and price that's another big one so nowhere in any of that was uh who has the fastest you know
[2223.58 --> 2229.90]  ssd right yeah that it's not in there because that's not why people buy by game consoles at the end of
[2229.90 --> 2238.86]  the day so i think that to me exclusives is going to be the thing that puts the momentum in on sony's
[2238.86 --> 2247.34]  side because if i played you know the the the last um oh man i haven't owned a playstation since the
[2247.34 --> 2253.26]  playstation 2 okay sure i played some uncharted game or whatever and i'm i'm invested in this series
[2253.26 --> 2260.06]  now you know i'm a playstation user um i think there's a strong chance i buy the new one yeah
[2260.06 --> 2265.82]  that makes sense and and i would agree with that i someone in in chat said uh the controllers are all
[2265.82 --> 2271.82]  good now it's not really the point yeah i think the controllers have been all good for quite a while
[2271.82 --> 2278.86]  yeah um i the the controller thing for me at least it's it's all about the thumbstick positioning
[2278.86 --> 2282.62]  and there's a huge difference between the two and it doesn't matter that the playstation controller is
[2282.62 --> 2288.70]  good for me it's it's the positioning of the thumbsticks throws off the usability of the
[2288.70 --> 2293.02]  controller by a massive amount for me personally because i'm so used to those offset thumbstick
[2293.02 --> 2298.70]  positions and so that's actually a pretty big deal it's not a fanboyism thing but it is a muscle
[2298.70 --> 2303.98]  memory thing that makes a big difference as as a gamer like you know if you're used to a keyboard and
[2303.98 --> 2310.06]  mouse or if you're used to uh inverted look for example if someone changes your control scheme
[2310.06 --> 2315.26]  and you are anything but you know a very entry-level gamer it's going to muck you up and so if you're
[2315.26 --> 2320.94]  used to the symmetrical thumbsticks you there's a there is a chance that that could be a determining
[2320.94 --> 2324.62]  factor for you to just say okay well all other things being equal i'm just i'm just gonna playstation 5
[2325.42 --> 2332.38]  i i got my xbox controller to work on uh the playstation 4 when i was using the playstation 4
[2332.38 --> 2339.18]  because of course you did so nuts yeah okay but like the the average user isn't going to do that
[2339.18 --> 2345.66]  it was actually a pretty fun project and it works very well but um yeah it's not going to be a normal
[2345.66 --> 2353.26]  thing you know what is going to be a normal thing sponsor talking about our sponsors oh yeah oh yeah
[2353.90 --> 2358.06]  i do want to talk about some more console stuff after though because my kids have been playing with
[2358.06 --> 2363.02]  my old game gear so don't let me forget all right the show today is brought to you by
[2363.98 --> 2370.38]  manscaped hey luke do you need some uh do you need to do some manscaping over there i noticed your bangs
[2370.38 --> 2376.22]  are uh they're banging they're uh wow they're uh they're pretty they're pretty long i mean it's mostly
[2376.22 --> 2382.46]  for body hair and stuff but like i'm pretty sure the lawnmower the lawnmower 3.0 could get you taken
[2382.46 --> 2388.46]  care of up there too you know up there and down there manscaped makes manscaping safe and easy

[2524.14 --> 2528.30]  seriousness though display has something for absolutely everyone if you like star wars i'm not
[2528.30 --> 2535.74]  going to shame you yet okay now sponsor spots over now i'm going to shame you okay so did you
[2535.74 --> 2541.82]  don't even have anything for the new star wars stuff well why would they it's all old star wars well
[2541.82 --> 2550.22]  that makes sense doesn't it one okay so did you see did you see that twitter exchange
[2551.50 --> 2560.46]  star wars story heads response to canon complaints did you see did you not see this no holy crap this
[2560.46 --> 2567.98]  is freaking awesome so uh one of the one of the story heads uh so lucasfilm story group creative
[2567.98 --> 2576.30]  executive matt martin told this is on twitter told fans to chill when it comes to canon because
[2576.30 --> 2582.46]  the way he sees it you can just kind of like have your own head canon you know you can you can include
[2582.46 --> 2589.66]  whatever you want or don't want to because it's all fake anyway which pretty much your face is so
[2589.66 --> 2595.10]  perfect right now i love it which pretty much amounts to like you guys are a bunch of nerds why do
[2595.10 --> 2603.90]  you even care so much about this talk about completely having no concept no understanding
[2603.90 --> 2610.94]  whatsoever of your customer and your fan base and then opening your mouth and demonstrating it for the
[2610.94 --> 2620.78]  entire world to see he basically said yeah at this point we understand that none of it makes any sense
[2620.78 --> 2628.14]  and we've given up and so should you because who cares anyway it's all fake of course it's fake it's
[2628.14 --> 2637.42]  a story that doesn't mean that there isn't a value to trying to tell a cohesive one who cares dave feloni
[2637.42 --> 2655.58]  just just brutal just absolutely brutal and it's like i i you know what i get it as someone if i were
[2655.58 --> 2662.06]  to come in onto that team right um actually no i was about to say if i were to if i were to join that team
[2662.06 --> 2667.50]  i i might be i might just kind of go yeah you know what forget it i give up this none of this makes
[2667.50 --> 2673.66]  any sense so we're just gonna have to just treat star wars like you know what it has become just kind
[2673.66 --> 2680.62]  of making it up as we go and plot holes and inconsistencies be damned because the ship completely
[2680.62 --> 2686.06]  sailed you know it sailed a long time ago i don't think i could do it though who wouldn't give up
[2686.06 --> 2700.94]  they follow okay fine um i just i just don't think it would be um yeah i i i don't think i could do it
[2700.94 --> 2708.62]  like if i if i if okay so so you know total total miracle you know someone a decision maker at disney
[2708.62 --> 2712.38]  is is watching this right now and they're like hey this guy seems to have his act together let's put
[2712.38 --> 2720.14]  linus in charge okay they bring me in tomorrow i would probably scrap like oh man i i would do some
[2720.14 --> 2727.50]  i would do some controversial stuff man so a i would scrap the entire sequel trilogy because um i
[2727.50 --> 2731.90]  actually very controversial i actually came up with well yes and no there's like there's salvageable
[2731.90 --> 2736.14]  stuff in there but i came up with this idea like right out of the gate right out of the gate the
[2736.14 --> 2744.14]  sequel trilogy makes no sense whatsoever because the notoriously racist empire has finn as a soldier
[2744.14 --> 2749.66]  which is like why so there was plenty of room for because i know a lot of people are really upset
[2749.66 --> 2754.14]  about the sequels because it felt like disney was trying to hit a diversity quota i actually don't
[2754.14 --> 2761.02]  mind that at all there is nothing wrong with that this is obviously a gigantic galaxy full of you know
[2761.02 --> 2768.70]  everything from from you know baby yodas to to humans to sarlaccs to whatever like it that diversity
[2768.70 --> 2776.70]  is is actually like core to star wars to me like if luke and obi-wan wandered into that cantina okay
[2776.70 --> 2782.54]  and it was full of like you know a bunch of white dudes like them we're not going to be like oh wow what
[2782.54 --> 2787.50]  a cool what a cool galaxy they've created that's totally different from somewhere that i could have
[2787.50 --> 2792.62]  walked down the street and gone like that would have been stupid diversity is is is foundational
[2792.62 --> 2799.26]  um but i think they should have just had ray and finn swap i think that and another thing too is uh
[2799.26 --> 2804.54]  because the the x stormtrooper had no character development or story arc whatsoever they should
[2804.54 --> 2813.42]  have had all the stormtroopers what's that it has no issue killing all his yeah exactly i think that ray ray
[2813.42 --> 2820.30]  the the trooper okay should have actually had like a really dark history and we should see her do
[2821.18 --> 2828.54]  something awful before something happens like some kind of some kind of catalyst needs to take place
[2828.54 --> 2833.90]  she's perfect she would be perfect for it you actually don't have to alter either of those
[2833.90 --> 2839.58]  characters at all you just need to put them in each other's roles you need to let that romance blossom
[2839.58 --> 2844.54]  the way that it was obviously supposed to uh you need to let them both be force sensitive the way
[2844.54 --> 2849.02]  that they were obviously supposed to the other really cool thing that this does for ray oh yeah i
[2849.02 --> 2853.90]  totally forgot about this when i was talking to someone else about it is that it adds some legitimacy
[2853.90 --> 2861.18]  whatsoever to the whole conflicted part of her story because that whole thing where she's like
[2861.18 --> 2868.38]  shooting force lightning one moment and then force healing the next moment is just it it just doesn't
[2868.38 --> 2873.50]  make any sense it's just stupid and you could be like oh well yeah well it's just all fake it's like
[2873.50 --> 2879.66]  yeah it's all fake but if i just wrote a completely incoherent garbage screenplay where nothing meshed
[2879.66 --> 2886.70]  with anything else that would also be fake and it would also be bad so if she actually did something
[2886.70 --> 2893.90]  really really awful at the beginning of that movie you know she is um she is kylo ren's or she's a knight of
[2893.90 --> 2901.34]  ren okay like give her some kind of significance now we're talking we've got kind of uh you know
[2901.34 --> 2907.50]  bumbling finn getting kind of swept up into into all of this you know maybe maybe he falls for her in
[2907.50 --> 2912.06]  spite of the fact that she's got this like evil side maybe they work through that together they both get
[2912.06 --> 2920.38]  actual character arcs as it is so much already they've got nothing and and you could you could have done all of
[2920.38 --> 2926.94]  that without even upsetting the people that are like uh main characters are are fulfilling diversity
[2926.94 --> 2933.42]  quotas blah blah blah because those actors in those roles would have been fantastic and those stories
[2933.42 --> 2940.78]  would have been ones that i would have wanted to hear as it was we had a stormtrooper who was just like
[2941.58 --> 2948.78]  you know honestly kind of a and never actually did anything um who then goes on to not really actually do
[2948.78 --> 2953.18]  anything and it's just like a sequence of events and i don't even i don't even blame anyone his
[2953.18 --> 2959.58]  character is so wasted completely completely wasted there's so many ways even the like force sensitive
[2959.58 --> 2964.30]  thing near the end which they tease so many times throughout that movie and then when you get out of
[2964.30 --> 2970.94]  it you're like wait that that was it and you know what the issue too is though is that because i i guess
[2970.94 --> 2977.18]  because of this attitude that it's just all fake anyway so who cares um they take so many liberties with
[2977.18 --> 2984.86]  the way that uh the way that the universe you know works right um like i got really upset when r2d2
[2984.86 --> 2990.30]  sprouted jetpacks in the prequel trilogy for the same reasons like if r2d2 doesn't have jetpacks to
[2990.30 --> 2996.38]  launch himself out of the swamp and dagobah in uh in empire strikes back excuse me then he doesn't have
[2996.38 --> 3002.62]  jetpacks to fly around and comically amuse the kids um you know and bop the droids or whatever and i think
[3002.62 --> 3009.82]  it's phantom menace um but so many people complained about how ray was like this super op force user
[3009.82 --> 3015.74]  right that was that was a common complaint we can all agree on that and there was there was a lot of
[3015.74 --> 3022.70]  speculation that like oh well it's because you know they're trying to pander to um you know people who
[3022.70 --> 3026.30]  think you know women should have more leading roles or whatever else it's it's all diversity
[3026.30 --> 3031.74]  quota it's all diversity quota no it's just bad storytelling and they did it all over the place
[3031.74 --> 3039.26]  you know look at the first scene where we meet poe dameron it's ridiculous do you remember it
[3040.06 --> 3045.18]  yeah i'm thinking about it right now yeah it's that ground battle where he basically rips in
[3045.18 --> 3051.66]  and is clearly like if we were to go into the actual like files okay the animation files the cgi
[3051.66 --> 3059.10]  we go in he's ripping around at literally 4x the speed of anything else in the air flying with reflexes
[3059.10 --> 3064.94]  that's isn't that's not when we first meet poe dameron right is it i believe that's our first
[3064.94 --> 3071.50]  introduction to him isn't it i thought we we come in pretty early with with finn coming off the ship
[3072.06 --> 3078.14]  and they're fighting on the ground and like poe shoots okay sorry okay whatever yeah i think you're
[3078.14 --> 3082.38]  right i think you're right so sorry the the one no not the one where we meet him then the one where
[3082.38 --> 3087.34]  he rips in with his x-wing when they're fighting on the ground and just he meets like the crew he meets the
[3087.34 --> 3093.66]  rest of the no the heroes yeah no look headshots absolutely everything flying around at triple to
[3093.66 --> 3098.46]  quadruple the speed of anything else in the air and you're looking at it going yeah you're looking at
[3098.46 --> 3105.26]  it going well that's just that's just stupid you know the best pilots in the galaxy you know a short
[3105.26 --> 3113.90]  20 years ago or whatever could not do that right um yeah almost certainly better training etc etc and he's
[3113.90 --> 3119.90]  not force sensitive well theoretically i mean hannah is so who knows yeah
[3123.10 --> 3128.70]  yeah so so you know what i i think i think his attitude is basically why star wars is dead to me
[3128.70 --> 3134.54]  and it should be dead to you because if they don't care at all about continuity and they're just going
[3134.54 --> 3143.42]  to go in and keep trying to fix one thing while breaking three others it is only going to get worse
[3145.34 --> 3155.42]  yeah um i i i don't know i i haven't i actually haven't watched the new um star wars clone wars
[3155.42 --> 3160.70]  series that came out um but the feedback that i've been seeing i've been trying to stay away from
[3160.70 --> 3166.62]  spoilers because i want to watch it all properly um but the feedback that i've been seeing uh is is
[3166.62 --> 3173.02]  really positive and the mandalorian was was awesome and it was mediocre you were just desperate
[3174.94 --> 3179.74]  okay it's awesome compared to the three most recent movies it's smallville in space
[3181.26 --> 3187.50]  that's fine compared to the three most recent movies i watched the whole thing so like i clearly made it
[3187.50 --> 3192.54]  through it like but it's it's it's smallville in space it's monster of the week it's buffy okay
[3193.18 --> 3197.66]  okay i'm not saying it's the greatest thing ever but it's the three most recent movies okay it's
[3197.66 --> 3203.18]  bewitched three most recent movies that's that show right von von bewitched is that that it'd be
[3203.18 --> 3207.18]  which is that that show where they're all like teen witches or something and there's like a monster
[3207.18 --> 3211.26]  and they have to defeat it i haven't seen any of these shows so i don't really charmed charmed sorry
[3211.26 --> 3216.62]  it's charmed not bewitched it's charmed it's smallville that's what it is i don't watch
[3216.62 --> 3221.02]  shows very often just fine compared to the three most recent movies integer overlord by the way just
[3221.02 --> 3227.66]  says hey there's like 150 like expanded uh or well previously expanded universe books that managed to
[3227.66 --> 3232.86]  keep the story straight here's an idea why don't you just use that i know right that's what everyone
[3232.86 --> 3237.58]  wanted them to do there is there is a bunch of garbage in there but there's also a lot of
[3237.58 --> 3243.98]  awesomeness i've had a really good time going through the eu okay i'm sorry i i was i really was
[3243.98 --> 3247.82]  being very rude i wasn't listening to your question hit me one more time one more time okay
[3248.54 --> 3252.70]  compare the mandalorian instead of instead of on its own yeah compare the mandalorian against the
[3252.70 --> 3262.22]  most recent three movies it's much worse than firefly okay yeah i mean yeah it is it is maybe a third
[3262.22 --> 3265.82]  as good as firefly instead of comparing it on its own
[3265.82 --> 3273.66]  compare the case of those three movies because there's some interesting aspects there too they
[3273.66 --> 3281.66]  said to i mean if you think about it he has to craft this show while these movies are coming out
[3282.30 --> 3284.86]  uh yeah and and they he had to like
[3286.94 --> 3293.42]  they had to work things into the show to explain stuff that was gonna happen in the upcoming movie
[3293.42 --> 3298.54]  right and there's like there is things that happen in the show that only happen in that show because
[3298.54 --> 3305.90]  the upcoming movie was coming yeah and they were like oh no we we need to do something um like when uh
[3307.66 --> 3312.22]  when uh baby yoda force heals yeah that's there because of the new movie
[3314.14 --> 3318.14]  i read this whole thing about it they were trying to like soft introduce it to the community so that
[3318.14 --> 3321.98]  people didn't freak out so much with the movie it didn't really save them at all but no it didn't
[3321.98 --> 3327.50]  because it was still stupid because there were still so many issues you know like why why didn't
[3327.50 --> 3333.58]  obi-wan just like force heal qui-gon why didn't everybody just force heal everyone ever why didn't
[3333.58 --> 3338.46]  qui-gon just force heal qui-gon yeah i mean because i mean there's all i mean there's so many problems
[3338.46 --> 3342.62]  like we could we could go and we could find problems everywhere but just some of them i don't find as
[3342.62 --> 3349.34]  offensive you know like um lightsabers for example the the o penis of a lightsaber has been a little
[3349.34 --> 3356.14]  bit inconsistent okay so on the one hand you've got luke and vader battling in bespin right in cloud
[3356.14 --> 3363.18]  city um and luke uh hits vader in the shoulder and it doesn't like cut off his arm all right
[3365.18 --> 3373.02]  um yeah then another example of you know lightsabers not being you know super de duper op would be when
[3373.02 --> 3377.66]  uh qui-gon and obi-wan are cutting their way out of the room where they're being held right at the
[3377.66 --> 3382.86]  beginning of phantom menace slow right okay so these are instances where are not of cutting
[3382.86 --> 3385.90]  their right of the room cutting their way into the other room whatever the point is they put it through
[3385.90 --> 3390.54]  and it's like it takes a long time to cut it it's more like like a plasma plasma cutter at that point
[3391.02 --> 3398.94]  um but then sorry then there are just there are instances where lightsabers seem to slice through
[3398.94 --> 3405.98]  anything instantly right so there are inconsistencies but i can i can accept i don't know if that's
[3405.98 --> 3410.62]  completely fair yeah i don't know if the lightsaber yeah because you don't know what that stuff is made
[3410.62 --> 3417.90]  of and if you look at uh like material science on earth there are materials that will will damage or
[3417.90 --> 3424.70]  cut or or scrape or whatever certain other materials instantly that look very similar to ones that they
[3424.70 --> 3433.42]  will do next to nothing too um and i think another example of the the o penis yeah calculation uh obi-wan's
[3433.42 --> 3440.38]  lightsaber completely failing against vader yes there's there's very few times that we see something
[3440.38 --> 3447.26]  like that again it's mentioned in the eu a bit yep um there's there's a really interesting book with
[3447.26 --> 3453.34]  mace window where where he has to like recharge his lightsaber um i don't remember what one it is but
[3455.02 --> 3459.98]  it's a it's a bit of a it's an interesting book it's kind of like a thriller anyways so the biggest
[3459.98 --> 3465.98]  problem is basically just that they they don't have any consistency and it's so far gone that i
[3465.98 --> 3472.70]  don't think anyone cares anymore and so they're saying dave pretty much cares if we don't care then no one
[3472.70 --> 3481.02]  should care so yeah i'm out the saltier than crate subreddit cares i'm done i think a lot of other
[3481.02 --> 3485.10]  people care dave filoni cares people still carolinas you know what i care you know what our audience
[3485.10 --> 3491.58]  cares about tech so here it is lg we should move back on to tech lg is working on a new dual screen
[3491.58 --> 3499.50]  phone that apparently swivels horizontally this is this is a gem all right this is a gem i'm gonna go
[3499.50 --> 3505.74]  ahead and screen share you guys on this because i absolutely love this thing here we go boom right like
[3505.74 --> 3513.98]  that yeah you like that okay so it swivels it swivels 90 degrees so you can have the best of
[3513.98 --> 3522.22]  both worlds while you also have the worst of both worlds you can you can i've been informed it's you
[3522.22 --> 3527.02]  can eat your cake and have it too not you can have your cake and eat it too so you get to eat your cake
[3527.02 --> 3534.30]  and have it too and your cake is made of boogers and your mouth is your mouth is cut up with razor
[3534.30 --> 3539.74]  blades before you eat it and there's lemon juice okay that's the kind of cake you're having and
[3540.78 --> 3548.22]  that's this phone so the back of it swivels out so you can use it in in a portrait mode with a
[3548.22 --> 3552.78]  keyboard which is the best way to use an on-screen keyboard landscape is literally just slower you just
[3552.78 --> 3557.50]  have to move your thumbs farther um you know it's not like it's making more room for more fingers or
[3557.50 --> 3562.70]  anything so this is this is good and then you could like watch a movie or have like you know a
[3563.26 --> 3569.10]  side-by-side multitasking experience or whatever the case may be if you're into that sort of thing and
[3569.10 --> 3574.46]  they are not going to sell a lot of these and um it's called the wing okay it's called the wing
[3574.46 --> 3582.30]  because they're just winging it at this point hey got them it's so weird
[3583.18 --> 3588.70]  i want to hear from you guys oh carn evil over on float plane it's hideous i'll take six
[3589.42 --> 3595.34]  this is this is like i don't even this doesn't matter at all yeah the the image that they used
[3595.34 --> 3601.50]  for the background of the the currently horizontal screen is horrible yeah i don't even know what that
[3601.50 --> 3607.82]  is i don't know yeah it's like weird aliasing going all over it i don't know there's there's there's like
[3607.82 --> 3614.06]  weird blurry parts for no reason they just weren't trying at all i don't know yeah i mean pretty
[3614.06 --> 3619.66]  similar to probably the the idea of this phone in general it's really surprising to me that the one
[3619.66 --> 3625.58]  dual screen concept that works okay i shouldn't say one because i haven't actually tried microsoft's
[3625.58 --> 3631.66]  thing microsoft's concept yet um but the the one dual screen android concept that i really liked
[3631.66 --> 3636.22]  having the screen on the front and the back and then just one camera instead of having a selfie
[3636.22 --> 3642.54]  camera so that back screen is basically just to like use to preview your selfies um never really
[3642.54 --> 3648.62]  took off with any manufacturers that matter like it was all it was all little ones that uh that went
[3648.62 --> 3654.46]  for that whereas like if i had the option to use my samsung rear-facing shooter for my selfies instead
[3654.46 --> 3661.66]  of having a punch a hole punched in my main display that would be so much better if all the r d that has
[3661.66 --> 3668.14]  gone into hole punch displays and front-facing cameras could have just been spent on making rear-facing
[3668.14 --> 3673.66]  cameras better and putting a crappy small screen on the back of the phone that would have just been
[3673.66 --> 3682.22]  better in every possible way video chatting video chatting is an application where it is not as good go get your tablet
[3684.46 --> 3690.14]  or or make the screen not that small and crappy if they release this which it sounds like they're
[3690.14 --> 3696.94]  actually going to wow just just i mean just in in the verbiage that is being used i don't see any
[3696.94 --> 3701.10]  statement that says we are definitely releasing this phone they're just in the verbiage that is being used
[3701.10 --> 3706.70]  yeah it sounds like they're going to if they release this will you will you mainline it for a certain
[3706.70 --> 3715.34]  period of time no uh yeah i will sure i'll do it for the lulz i'll do it i'll do it i love that that
[3715.34 --> 3724.46]  painful retraction i'll do it i'll do it basically like a slider except worse in every way uh it's got
[3724.46 --> 3730.62]  a snapdragon 700 series processor with 5g support so low-end low-end chip uh triple camera set up with
[3730.62 --> 3736.06]  64 megapixel primary sensor but it's lg so it's gonna be like and the price is expected to be just over
[3736.06 --> 3742.14]  800 us dollars in fairness i guess there's a lot of validation that goes into building a bad phone
[3742.14 --> 3751.74]  but um hey they did it so you know they gotta get paid yo yeah uh i have a actually a line off the
[3751.74 --> 3756.94]  shelves you know what in line with my uh my conversation earlier about how super chats are
[3756.94 --> 3760.30]  actually a great value they're not i usually don't look at them because where this is the
[3760.30 --> 3765.98]  wan show and we don't do a ton of q a so i'm not actually defending defending that um but in line
[3765.98 --> 3769.90]  with that i actually do have a super chat that i went out of my way to answer over the course of
[3769.90 --> 3773.34]  this week because i didn't have a good answer from someone last week and it's kind of an interesting
[3773.34 --> 3779.74]  discussion so someone asked does demonetized content get paid by youtube premium subscribers
[3779.74 --> 3785.74]  do you remember talking about this so if you yes if you've got a yellow icon um and someone with
[3785.74 --> 3790.62]  youtube premium watches where there is no advertiser relationship for youtube to worry about
[3791.42 --> 3797.26]  do they still get your youtube premium revenue and i got an answer back from creator help and
[3797.26 --> 3804.22]  they said it depends on what type of demonetization it is if it's a copyright claim claim uh claim you
[3804.22 --> 3809.02]  will not be able to earn any of the revenue including premium that will go to the copyright holder
[3809.02 --> 3817.18]  if it's a yellow icon so that is to say that like um you've talked about the controversial
[3817.18 --> 3823.02]  coronavirus at a time when that was considered um i forget what it fell under but it was it was
[3823.02 --> 3830.14]  you you weren't eligible for monetization because it was like uh uh man i don't i don't remember it
[3830.14 --> 3835.90]  doesn't matter uh the point is yeah it was bad news there that's that's about it um so if it's
[3835.90 --> 3841.18]  something like that you should be eligible to earn premium and it will note so on the icon if you hover
[3841.18 --> 3847.82]  over it so here's a screenshot that i can share with you guys which is cool it's nice that their
[3847.82 --> 3853.66]  answer to that question was like look at the thing yeah check this out it's nice that that wasn't hidden
[3854.54 --> 3859.10]  this video is running limited or no ads due to content identified as not suitable but it remains
[3859.10 --> 3864.70]  fully playable and is eligible to earn subscription revenue from youtube premium youtube premium really
[3864.70 --> 3870.94]  is one of the best ways if you're not willing to go over on float plane and support creators it really
[3870.94 --> 3878.70]  is one of the best ways to dramatically increase the amount of um contribution that you're making to
[3878.70 --> 3882.62]  your favorite creators and i'm not i'm not saying just me i'm saying if you get a youtube premium
[3882.62 --> 3891.42]  subscription it completely changes the game i was talking to our youtube uh contact about uh here let me
[3891.42 --> 3898.38]  just find this um blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it had a few back and forth so i'm trying to find
[3898.38 --> 3906.94]  the right one uh but i was talking about how the heck it is that some of our long format content does so
[3906.94 --> 3915.58]  much better than our shorter videos when it comes to adsense and he basically said well i think you're not
[3915.58 --> 3922.94]  digging deep enough into the analytics because i thought that even though we don't run mid rolls on
[3922.94 --> 3930.22]  our long format content i thought that for some reason the fact that it had higher retention or or
[3930.22 --> 3937.98]  something was causing it to uh to pay out at a higher rate but it's not actually like that i need to find
[3937.98 --> 3945.90]  this where is it issue with view analytics no um okay luke do you want to stall for time for a little
[3945.90 --> 3952.78]  bit for me today while i while i try and find this thing uh tsmc theoretically allegedly potentially
[3952.78 --> 3961.18]  planning on opening a fab in the us by 2023 it would be a 12 billion dollar construction in arizona
[3961.18 --> 3968.86]  uh they're planning to produce five nanometer chips starting in 2023 expected capacity is to be 20 000
[3968.86 --> 3977.26]  silicon wafers per month uh this would have to be heavily subsidized uh it is unclear exactly how much
[3977.82 --> 3984.94]  but according to tsmc chairman mark liu it is more expensive to operate in the us unsurprising uh than
[3984.94 --> 3992.14]  taiwan or the or or or china i presume so the company will require major subsidies uh this is
[3992.14 --> 3997.34]  apparently in in in the works potentially because there are fears that intel will build its future
[3997.34 --> 4004.22]  chip plants in china or taiwan uh experts believe that it is crucial for the us to invest more in fabs
[4004.22 --> 4012.06]  like taiwan and china and israel actually as well have done um and with ramping tensions with china that
[4012.06 --> 4021.82]  that kind of makes sense um apparently it's already confirmed wow um that's quick okay okay so this is
[4021.82 --> 4028.46]  pretty sweet so here's one quick thing sorry i just want to finish um ian cut dr ian cutras said uh by
[4028.46 --> 4033.74]  this time five nanometer won't be the leading edge but it will take some of the volume pressure off of
[4033.74 --> 4041.34]  taiwan's fabs at 20 000 wafers uh wafer starts per month it's nowhere near the gigafabs that do a
[4041.34 --> 4046.62]  hundred thousand that's assuming they break ground at all i have my doubts well apparently it's been
[4046.62 --> 4052.38]  confirmed it is three years out we will see if they actually do break ground but yeah the lower
[4052.38 --> 4059.74]  production amounts etc etc yeah okay so this is interesting as it sounds this is this is pretty
[4059.74 --> 4065.82]  interesting uh there's two videos here uh back to the how much of a difference youtube premium makes
[4065.82 --> 4070.86]  i've got two videos here one of them is building an epic portable gaming rig at home that's a video
[4070.86 --> 4076.06]  that performed quite well for us about around two million views and then there's another video um
[4077.66 --> 4081.98]  oh wait no it's about one million one million and then there's another video ultimate ikea gaming
[4081.98 --> 4086.22]  desk that is about two million and i sent these over to our rep because i was confused i said here's
[4086.22 --> 4095.82]  the thing ultimate ikea gaming desk did uh let's let's use uh let's use x okay did 3x revenue okay at
[4095.82 --> 4104.06]  2 million views and building a portable gaming rig at home did 2.5x revenue at 1 million views so at half
[4104.06 --> 4113.50]  the views it was five sixth of the revenue crazy right so i had been attributing this to just uh you
[4113.50 --> 4118.14]  know long format even though we don't run mid rolls but what it actually turned out to be
[4118.14 --> 4125.34]  was that hold on let me make sure i've got the color coding right here ah yes okay so the ultimate
[4125.34 --> 4132.78]  ikea gaming desk the two million view video did about double the adsense so the like partner ad revenue
[4132.78 --> 4138.70]  of the other one it was right in line because we don't run mid rolls and then building an epic portable
[4138.70 --> 4146.22]  gaming rig at home even though it had half as many views actually did about looks like about 20 percent
[4146.22 --> 4158.06]  more than the one with twice as many views crazy right so those views are actually worth um like
[4158.06 --> 4164.14]  many many times like it's even more extreme than i knew they're worth many many more times especially
[4164.14 --> 4170.86]  for longer format content where it's uh it's weighted by watch time so i thought that was
[4170.86 --> 4176.30]  very interesting and i thought i would share that with you guys because uh someone asked last week and
[4176.30 --> 4184.78]  i said that i would get them an answer cool more more topics or super chats uh let's get through some super
[4184.78 --> 4194.86]  chats speaking of uh super chance all right we got at least a few in here that we definitely got to
[4194.86 --> 4199.50]  do tyler yates says it's 1am and i'm still up so i figured wet the hay why not finally watch this live
[4199.50 --> 4208.22]  heck yeah good work tyler yates thanks oliver brody nathan warnick says learned a new way to eat corn
[4208.22 --> 4217.02]  oh lordy oh man my son managed to make it on r slash live stream fails yesterday because he was
[4217.02 --> 4222.46]  eating a piece of corn by putting the entire end of the corn in his mouth and picking off with his
[4222.46 --> 4230.14]  front teeth one kernel at a time and then taking it all the way out and eating it and i was like please stop
[4230.14 --> 4242.86]  that's just like a kids will be kids kind of moment yeah i know but it's just unfortunate you should
[4242.86 --> 4248.86]  have seen me eat a pickle when i was like you know eight years old like it is what it is but yeah
[4249.74 --> 4255.66]  now it's live um yeah exactly that's that's gonna be kind of the unfortunate thing about his generation
[4255.66 --> 4263.74]  i think yeah now there's a clip of it on live stream fails and like there's also so much content
[4263.74 --> 4270.62]  that i actually have in some ways a harder time finding an old meme these days depending how viral
[4270.62 --> 4278.30]  it went you know yep yep that's fair robert mail it's not gonna make it go any faster dude um tommy gun
[4278.30 --> 4284.46]  heard you need a new ratchet screwdriver uh i can't say anything but i don't oh
[4285.98 --> 4291.98]  that's all i have to say about that uh what else we got here dom r last week uh luke said the more
[4291.98 --> 4297.90]  we bug you about stuff the more it will happen i want wanshow shirts it's not how it works big
[4297.90 --> 4307.58]  facts it's not how it works luke lied to you hashtag lie you caness uh lie you like yeah lie you uh lost
[4307.58 --> 4313.82]  boyo says sorry to hear about ltt men uh take my money in other forms i think you mean ltx and thank you
[4313.82 --> 4316.86]  wow i was a 50 super chat you crazy
[4319.66 --> 4323.74]  uh lucas says well loving the work from home videos my kids have the same toy kitchen and
[4323.74 --> 4327.18]  also wreck the faucet in the same way yeah they're so cheap it's like it's hard to find
[4327.18 --> 4332.30]  like good quality kids toys you know uh terry says folding at home numbers are down we're trailing
[4332.30 --> 4339.34]  default and daily production come on come on team let's get folding again actually the motherboard
[4339.34 --> 4343.50]  failed in our monster folding rig so we got a new one in but it's going to take a while with all that
[4343.50 --> 4349.90]  water cooling in it to get it swapped out so there's that uh mendelity is linus luke's little brother no
[4349.90 --> 4357.98]  we don't even look that similar like look at us you have a beard now you have blue eyes yeah exactly
[4359.10 --> 4359.98]  like you're blonde
[4362.46 --> 4368.78]  uh jensen's uh hr penguin says jensen should reveal the 3080 ti by pulling it out of the microwave it is
[4368.78 --> 4374.14]  consumer level after all i like it i'm into it i don't know if he i mean his he might have a microwave
[4374.14 --> 4380.06]  if they if they've made a microwave out of like volcanic glass and stonework i know right sure if
[4380.06 --> 4385.66]  they have i don't know if it would match his kitchen otherwise uh sergeant amos thank you very much
[4386.22 --> 4390.86]  a dozen i recently watched the video where you re-soldered ryzen cpu pins and noticed that when
[4390.86 --> 4396.22]  they're removed it looks like an lga chip at that point would it fit into an intel motherboard heck no
[4396.22 --> 4401.50]  heck no they would not be they would not be intel compatible just by removing the pins
[4401.50 --> 4409.26]  the real smiley says baha ha ha you busted me being a butt linus i retract my statement on super chats
[4409.26 --> 4415.18]  by super chats thank you real smiley i know i'm not actually endorsing the statement you're making
[4415.18 --> 4420.54]  there because generally speaking they're not a great value and we often forget to get to them but uh
[4420.54 --> 4428.94]  hey at least you got your money's worth i guess oof baldo says tofik lindan or lee chong way took off gada
[4428.94 --> 4435.98]  of course all right so the problem with that question is that it only has one obvious answer
[4436.78 --> 4442.70]  lindan um but this is a badminton i'm still i'm still i'm still lee chong way for life okay that's
[4442.70 --> 4446.70]  that's how i feel about it and there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind
[4446.70 --> 4453.42]  yes it's badminton i'm going to recognize some of those names i'm going back to badminton next week
[4455.02 --> 4461.02]  i want a sport that we can play that you aren't so astronomically far ahead of me in football
[4462.06 --> 4463.34]  but that's the opposite problem
[4463.34 --> 4466.38]  yeah i was like sure
[4470.14 --> 4474.70]  well no what we have to do is we have to pick up a new sport that's the trick yeah so we just have to
[4474.70 --> 4480.30]  try something new can't be swimming because you suck at that no offense yep can't be badminton you're
[4480.30 --> 4484.86]  terrible that's fine you could get better i think i think you actually do have some potential for
[4484.86 --> 4489.58]  badminton um i'm definitely down to try for badminton but it's gonna be a painful beginning it
[4489.58 --> 4494.54]  would be it would be like a 10 year 10 year battle you know yeah you'd have to get continuously
[4494.54 --> 4498.46]  better over the next 10 years and i'd probably have to get a little worse and i'd have to yeah
[4498.46 --> 4504.14]  i'd have to that's see that's kind of the issue is i'd have to get better at a at a at a rate that's
[4505.42 --> 4509.74]  much higher than the rate that you are actively getting better as well right because yeah i'm going
[4509.74 --> 4514.94]  to keep training so yeah there's that so okay we need sport we need sport recommendations ladies and
[4514.94 --> 4522.94]  gentlemen yeah come on hit us up sammy mcphone says i hate podcasts why am i here because this
[4522.94 --> 4530.30]  isn't a podcast this is far crappier than a podcast and that's why you like it uh kwang lu says uh stay
[4530.30 --> 4534.70]  healthy everyone rob white says think we will see john again in tech linked or will he be staying in the
[4534.70 --> 4541.98]  u.s uh we bring john up um typically twice a year at least uh we like to bring him up for workation
[4541.98 --> 4547.50]  uh or like whatever our corporate get together is for the year and we always bring him up for the
[4547.50 --> 4552.54]  company christmas party um that's something that's very important to me having everybody there it's uh
[4552.54 --> 4557.74]  it's sort of an inside joke at linus media group the christmas party is optional but you better be there
[4562.86 --> 4569.66]  speaking of which um flow plane usually not usually i guess there hasn't been a ton of these
[4569.66 --> 4575.50]  uh last year and we were going to do this moving forward yeah we have the float plane team meetup
[4575.50 --> 4580.14]  around ltx because well probably i know right people on the team are gonna be interested in that
[4580.14 --> 4586.22]  so that's not gonna work anymore and it's very possible that around that time if we try to do
[4586.22 --> 4591.74]  something at that time it would still be very ill-advised to travel so potentially the team meetup
[4591.74 --> 4598.54]  for floatplane this year is just off does anyone have any ideas of what we should do so far i have ideas
[4598.54 --> 4605.58]  but they're not that great so um we do have some suggestions for sports uh bowling okay i don't
[4605.58 --> 4612.86]  think i'm white enough to bowl yeah like seriously like to seriously bowl um pickleball i would destroy
[4612.86 --> 4616.94]  luke at pickleball it's basically badminton done uh frizz golf
[4619.98 --> 4628.38]  i suck at it me too okay frizz golf we have we have a contender curling luke would just absolutely
[4628.78 --> 4636.86]  wreck me at curling like that would no it would not be pretty paintball i actually okay okay i was yeah
[4637.42 --> 4643.34]  i actually meant to ask you like a week ago yeah if you would be interested i was thinking airsoft
[4643.34 --> 4648.70]  because it's easier to clean up and if we're doing it very often yeah it would make more sense but yeah
[4648.70 --> 4657.10]  yeah i it's a good cardio sport you know what i actually last season i um i i forget why i did it
[4657.10 --> 4662.06]  i wanted to use my paintball gun for something like just target practice in the backyard or something
[4662.06 --> 4669.34]  i found out it was broken so i like got it all sorted out i i fixed up my mark my marker i oiled
[4669.34 --> 4675.42]  everything up i actually got a new um i got a new tank because i found a good deal on one i fixed up my
[4675.42 --> 4684.78]  mask i got a backup mask i am like i am ready to go to play some paintball so yeah a field sport like
[4684.78 --> 4692.06]  that sounds really fun to me i'm super down for some paintball um cool olenic says start the training
[4692.06 --> 4699.50]  montage softball softball i would actually love to play softball i just don't think i can commit the
[4699.50 --> 4708.38]  time to join the team yeah a pickup game style sport would probably be a better idea yeah jc sand
[4708.38 --> 4712.86]  says game gear oh yeah i was going to talk about that uh i dug uh an old game gear out it's not
[4712.86 --> 4718.22]  actually mine from when i was a kid but it's like obviously the same game like same game console and
[4718.22 --> 4725.74]  my kids absolutely love it even though we have a switch vr games galore wii u like we've got so much
[4725.74 --> 4732.06]  gaming gear in the house and yet something about just the simplicity of like two buttons and
[4734.06 --> 4739.02]  a little thing that you just hold in your hand they they they were like obsessed with it yesterday
[4739.02 --> 4749.10]  it only came up because there's this i think it's called is it called the retro gen uh crap no it's not
[4749.10 --> 4755.90]  retro gen hold on i shot it this week so it's going to be in my in my trello here uh but i shot
[4755.90 --> 4761.58]  a video evercade it's about the so evercade is this handheld console that's got officially licensed
[4761.58 --> 4768.46]  old games from like interplay atari like that kind of thing and uh my son shot the unboxing with
[4768.46 --> 4772.30]  me for short circuit and i promised him that he could play with it after and then i went and sent it
[4772.30 --> 4778.22]  back to the office um without remembering to let him play with it and he was like oh well what the
[4778.22 --> 4782.78]  heck dad and i was like oh well you know what i've got it's basically the same thing and i had this game
[4782.78 --> 4787.10]  gear just sitting in the attic that i hadn't like touched since i acquired it as a prop a while back
[4787.66 --> 4791.50]  and as far as he was concerned it was the same thing and then my daughters were like wow that's so
[4791.50 --> 4795.02]  cool and they were all they're all playing with it i just thought it was really neat because that was
[4795.02 --> 4801.26]  i was his age i was one year older than my son when i got a game gear for christmas and i even had the
[4801.26 --> 4804.94]  same games that i played he was trying the uh the lion king game for game gear actually very good
[4809.50 --> 4817.50]  and i think that's pretty much it for the wan show yeah um tom's hold on a second i got a super
[4817.50 --> 4823.90]  chat tom cigar says i folded 25 million for ltt thanks for schooling me what the f is this you have
[4823.90 --> 4829.26]  been placed in timeout by the owner of this video or moderator i i don't know why you're in timeout but
[4829.26 --> 4834.78]  it was a moderator not me so apparently you got past it by paying to chat that's really not the
