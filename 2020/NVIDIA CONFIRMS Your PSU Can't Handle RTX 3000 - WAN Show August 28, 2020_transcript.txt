[0.00 --> 0.82]  Give it a sec.
[0.90 --> 1.42]  Give it a sec.
[6.42 --> 8.00]  This is so janky.
[10.92 --> 12.04]  I love it.
[22.10 --> 24.24]  And we are live.
[24.36 --> 26.10]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[26.20 --> 28.32]  We've got a fantastic show for you guys today.
[28.32 --> 29.96]  There's been a ton of news.
[30.08 --> 33.00]  There's the whole epic Apple lawsuit thing.
[33.56 --> 34.06]  Oh, man.
[34.10 --> 35.22]  That works so well.
[35.64 --> 37.12]  Epic Apple lawsuit.
[37.36 --> 37.54]  It does.
[37.66 --> 38.30]  Absolutely love it.
[38.32 --> 41.34]  Because the whole thing is flipping epic.
[41.96 --> 43.78]  There's Corsair's IPO.
[44.12 --> 44.64]  Corsair?
[45.40 --> 47.28]  Corsair is trying to go public.
[47.66 --> 47.94]  What?
[48.82 --> 49.20]  What?
[49.68 --> 50.46]  Pretty wild.
[50.68 --> 55.58]  I'm sure COVID, oddly enough, has actually helped that quite a bit with their acquisition of Elvado.
[55.58 --> 60.32]  Believe it or not, they've got some deets about that in their filings.
[60.50 --> 62.38]  So we're definitely going to dig into that.
[62.46 --> 63.28]  What else we got today?
[63.80 --> 68.58]  Apple may be preparing its own search engine of all things.
[69.28 --> 70.48]  They're so good at maps.
[70.48 --> 75.90]  Probably a rough subject over there.
[76.66 --> 80.50]  And there's a Russian hacking plot that targeted a Tesla factory.
[80.62 --> 81.88]  It's actually kind of juicy.
[82.16 --> 82.50]  Yeah.
[82.78 --> 83.36]  Oh, man.
[83.48 --> 85.58]  I actually forgot about that one.
[85.74 --> 88.24]  When you stepped away, I teased them about what we had.
[88.34 --> 90.68]  NVIDIA confirms the new 12-volt connector.
[91.56 --> 95.32]  And teases accurate RTX 3000 series coolers.
[95.64 --> 97.02]  Like, oh, there's so much stuff.
[97.06 --> 97.80]  So let's not wait.
[97.92 --> 98.76]  Let's get into it.
[98.76 --> 100.08]  Should be a good week.
[107.48 --> 114.54]  And here I am just breaking my F5 button, trying to figure out when the app information is going to update.
[114.72 --> 115.78]  I know, right?
[115.84 --> 117.20]  We should talk about that, too.
[117.58 --> 120.58]  That's sort of, it's actually kind of related to one of our new, like,
[120.80 --> 126.48]  Apple being at war with their developers situation that they got going on.
[126.48 --> 131.56]  So why don't we jump right into, why don't we jump right into that one first, then?
[132.60 --> 132.76]  Sure.
[132.94 --> 138.54]  Split decision in the epic Apple lawsuit results in a split Fortnite.
[138.54 --> 149.54]  And I realize a lot of you guys might not play Fortnite or you might be all down on Fortnite because it's for kids or it's a bad game or whatever the case may be.
[149.54 --> 156.54]  But platform fragmentation like this is honestly just not really good for anyone.
[156.54 --> 166.52]  Like, the overwhelming trend in the industry over the last few years, and I've been very supportive of this, is towards more cross-platform play.
[167.20 --> 168.86]  More cross-platform interaction.
[169.42 --> 171.50]  Better cross-platform licensing.
[171.50 --> 182.54]  Microsoft has absolutely been a pioneer when it comes to cross-platform licensing of games, for example, where you buy it for one system and that's a game that you own.
[182.64 --> 185.96]  And you want to play it on your PC, your Xbox, your other more different Xbox.
[186.36 --> 186.98]  You're good.
[187.06 --> 187.48]  You own it.
[187.62 --> 194.36]  This is never good and always bad for the consumer when this kind of fragmentation happens.
[194.36 --> 197.30]  But let's dig a little bit into why it's happening.
[197.52 --> 204.04]  So a U.S. district judge handed legal victories and defeats to both Apple and Epic in their App Store feud.
[204.12 --> 217.16]  For those of you who are a little behind the times on this developing story, pretty much Epic is real sick and tired of paying 30% of their in-app revenue to Apple and Google.
[217.16 --> 223.18]  But they've been really focused more on Apple with the cheekier aspects of this whole thing.
[223.18 --> 230.70]  Apple is real happy collecting 30% of all revenues that go through the App Store.
[231.24 --> 233.32]  And that's causing some conflict.
[234.06 --> 237.60]  Epic tried to get an exception, not just for themselves.
[237.74 --> 242.22]  They actually asked for a reduction in fees for other developers as well.
[242.60 --> 243.80]  Apple basically said no.
[243.80 --> 252.16]  So Epic gave them a big, yeah, with like an in-game event where they did a parody of Apple's famous 1984 commercial and all that kind of stuff.
[252.16 --> 258.20]  Served them with a gigantic lawsuit outlying why Apple's behavior is monopolistic and should be illegal.
[258.68 --> 273.22]  And then Apple turned around and basically yoinked not just Fortnite from the App Store, but actually, unlike on Android, Apple can remove Fortnite from phones where it's already installed.
[273.22 --> 274.74]  They actually do have that power.
[275.30 --> 292.00]  And to add insult to injury, Apple pulled Epic's Unreal Engine developer tools that they need, not just for themselves for Fortnite, but also for their customers who license the Unreal Engine for games that run on Apple devices.
[293.12 --> 295.22]  So that's the history.
[295.40 --> 298.06]  Now let's get into what's gone on this week.
[298.06 --> 302.38]  So neither side got the slam dunk that they had each hoped for.
[302.54 --> 312.12]  So the court partly granted and partly denied Epic's motion for a temporary restraining order on Apple pulling their development tools and Fortnite from the App Store.
[312.12 --> 331.68]  So, but Apple is temporarily restrained from taking any action against Epic Games in retaliation for their lawsuit with respect to restricting, suspending, or terminating any affiliate of Epic Games from the Apple dev program, including Unreal Engine.
[331.68 --> 335.58]  So basically it's localized to Fortnite specifically.
[335.92 --> 336.32]  Yes.
[336.60 --> 337.82]  Which actually kind of makes sense.
[337.88 --> 348.64]  Isn't that crazy that Fortnite has become this, like, not just cultural phenomenon in terms of games, but like the eye of this storm around...
[348.64 --> 349.34]  Like a legal chess piece.
[349.56 --> 350.46]  Yeah, right?
[350.80 --> 351.68]  Isn't that crazy?
[352.06 --> 352.72]  It's pretty wild.
[352.72 --> 365.42]  Now, Apple can continue banning Fortnite on the App Store until Epic returns it to its pre-ban condition in which it no longer tries to bypass in-app purchase fees.
[365.70 --> 372.06]  Right, I missed that part where Epic, as part of their Neener Neener, just included a way to buy...
[372.06 --> 374.44]  I forget what the in-game currency is called in Fortnite.
[374.64 --> 375.02]  I'm sorry.
[375.30 --> 375.72]  V-Bucks.
[375.84 --> 376.24]  Sure, whatever.
[376.42 --> 378.78]  I don't play, but I've been following the news on this a lot.
[378.78 --> 383.98]  Sure, they made it so you could buy V-Bucks in-game, bypassing Apple's 30% cut.
[385.20 --> 389.24]  So, here's what's going to happen then.
[389.56 --> 393.16]  Because I really don't foresee Epic backing down on this.
[393.28 --> 402.60]  Remember, guys, we're talking if Epic gets the kind of fee structure that they think is fair, which based on their own Epic Games store is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15%.
[402.60 --> 408.66]  We're talking tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue that are being fought over here.
[408.76 --> 412.84]  And Epic has already, at this point, soured the relationship.
[413.30 --> 420.94]  You know, Tim and Tim are not going to be getting together for, like, you know, a bro-down, you know, gaming session.
[421.40 --> 423.82]  Or, like, I don't know, whatever Tim Cook does for fun.
[424.66 --> 425.84]  Anytime soon.
[426.62 --> 429.08]  So, like, the relationship's already sour.
[429.56 --> 432.10]  There's tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the line.
[432.20 --> 437.06]  They've already, not just that, but they've already invested in all the legal fees to put this case together.
[437.40 --> 439.14]  I really don't think they're going to back down.
[439.30 --> 444.16]  So, what's happening is Fortnite is going to be splitting into two different games.
[444.16 --> 448.54]  Since iOS players are going to be stuck on the current version for some time.
[448.68 --> 454.92]  So, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Android players will all continue to have cross-play compatibility and new content.
[455.32 --> 458.46]  And Apple users will be left without any new content.
[459.06 --> 462.54]  So, they're essentially held in limbo in the game's current state.
[462.54 --> 471.24]  It's interesting because they, so, are they pulling their custom payments then?
[472.50 --> 473.80]  To get back on the App Store?
[473.88 --> 476.70]  Because, as far as my understanding goes, I didn't have it installed.
[476.70 --> 478.06]  Well, I don't think they're on the App Store.
[478.64 --> 481.80]  So, they're not on the App Store and they were removed from iOS phones, were they not?
[482.82 --> 485.90]  Well, I don't think Apple ever actually did that.
[486.18 --> 486.60]  Oh, okay.
[486.60 --> 488.04]  So, they have the ability to.
[488.16 --> 488.88]  Yes, they can.
[488.96 --> 489.86]  But check this out.
[489.86 --> 491.24]  So, here's eBay.
[492.64 --> 494.38]  So, that looks fine.
[494.54 --> 498.46]  Apple iPhone XS Max got an auction there.
[498.54 --> 499.08]  Hold on a second.
[499.20 --> 499.64]  Let's just go.
[500.26 --> 500.78]  Whoa!
[502.60 --> 506.24]  Is that a $3,000 iPhone with Fortnite on it?
[506.50 --> 507.02]  What?
[507.56 --> 507.74]  Whoa!
[507.94 --> 509.94]  $2,000 iPhone with Fortnite.
[510.12 --> 510.96]  Oh, plus AirPods.
[511.14 --> 511.78]  Comes with AirPods.
[512.38 --> 513.16]  What else we got?
[513.24 --> 513.86]  $2,600.
[514.28 --> 518.60]  Let's see if we can find some iPhones with Fortnite.
[518.60 --> 519.34]  Hold on a second.
[519.86 --> 522.32]  Show only sold items.
[522.98 --> 523.60]  Here we go.
[524.04 --> 530.24]  Is there like some way to see what the highest one of these has actually sold for?
[530.50 --> 531.56]  Are these actually moving?
[531.72 --> 533.54]  This one sold at $1750.
[534.06 --> 539.18]  An iPhone XR 64 gig with Fortnite installed for $1750.
[540.18 --> 542.40]  Some of them are going for not a lot.
[542.50 --> 546.48]  So, it seems to kind of come down to luck of the draw if you're going to find a taker.
[546.80 --> 550.42]  So, a brand new iPhone XR 64 gig is $799.
[550.68 --> 551.80]  So, that was essentially...
[551.80 --> 554.70]  Someone essentially paid $1,000 to have Fortnite installed?
[555.20 --> 555.68]  Is that right?
[555.92 --> 556.32]  Apparently.
[557.20 --> 558.38]  That's what it looks like.
[558.38 --> 560.76]  So, this has a couple of bids right here.
[560.88 --> 563.60]  So, there's a XS Max 256 gig for $1,700.
[565.46 --> 567.96]  So, it looks like it's kind of all over the place.
[568.04 --> 572.90]  But there are definitely people that are paying more for an iPhone with Fortnite installed.
[572.90 --> 575.44]  So, it shows you what the demand is like.
[576.00 --> 577.80]  And what I wonder is if...
[577.80 --> 581.90]  Because, yes, Epic could easily return their app to a...
[582.52 --> 583.28]  Here you go, Apple.
[583.40 --> 585.86]  Here's 30% of our V-Bucks revenue state.
[586.30 --> 591.18]  And their users would be allowed to have new Fortnite updates.
[591.62 --> 593.32]  But it seems like the...
[593.32 --> 597.96]  It seems like the gamble that Epic is banking on here
[597.96 --> 602.92]  is that between their verbiage in all of their...
[602.92 --> 605.12]  In all their materials they've released about this
[605.12 --> 608.96]  and their parody and the way they've sort of rallied...
[608.96 --> 611.64]  Railed against Apple as a monopolist and all that.
[611.74 --> 614.90]  It seems like they are counting on themselves
[614.90 --> 617.74]  looking like the good guys in this...
[617.74 --> 619.64]  In what's probably going to become a war of attrition.
[619.74 --> 621.48]  This could take a very long time.
[622.76 --> 626.56]  Because if Epic plays their cards right here,
[626.56 --> 630.80]  the customers will put pressure on Apple to yield
[630.80 --> 634.84]  and give developers a better share of the revenue
[634.84 --> 636.94]  and Epic will win that way.
[637.56 --> 640.12]  But if Epic miscalculated here
[640.12 --> 642.76]  and users side with Apple
[642.76 --> 647.12]  and they think that 30% is a perfectly fair amount to pay
[647.12 --> 651.90]  for basically payment processing and a safe platform.
[652.04 --> 653.44]  Because really that's a lot of Apple's argument.
[653.44 --> 655.80]  We need that money to...
[655.80 --> 658.56]  So it's even worth our time to keep investing in the App Store.
[658.64 --> 661.12]  That's basically how it came across when I was reading it.
[661.44 --> 662.68]  I was like, really you guys?
[663.30 --> 665.06]  No, you invest in the App Store
[665.06 --> 667.00]  because you need to sell a lot of iPhones.
[667.22 --> 669.56]  Even if you got 5%,
[669.56 --> 671.60]  you'd keep investing in the App Store
[671.60 --> 673.74]  because that's what makes you a relevant platform.
[674.42 --> 676.72]  Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers,
[676.72 --> 679.72]  developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers,
[679.72 --> 680.54]  Sorry.
[680.54 --> 682.76]  That was an epic.
[682.76 --> 684.04]  You should...
[684.04 --> 687.66]  I bet you if you just search developers, developers, developers,
[687.66 --> 689.48]  you'll find what that was a reference to.
[689.50 --> 689.94]  Yeah, yeah.
[690.08 --> 691.74]  Oh, it's so funny.
[692.18 --> 692.70]  It's great.
[692.96 --> 695.06]  That guy is like a bazillionaire now
[695.06 --> 696.18]  and owns a sports team.
[696.32 --> 696.90]  It's like how...
[696.90 --> 697.46]  Whatever.
[697.68 --> 699.48]  The world is a funny place to live.
[701.36 --> 702.04]  But anyway...
[702.04 --> 703.84]  Speaking of all of this, should I translate?
[703.90 --> 705.02]  Okay, I'll say one more thing.
[705.02 --> 707.22]  No, I want your opinion first on this.
[707.56 --> 707.76]  Okay.
[707.76 --> 711.68]  So which way do you think the typical Apple customer is going to go?
[711.74 --> 712.48]  Who do they blame?
[712.64 --> 716.58]  Because either Apple or Epic can fix this with the push of a button.
[717.42 --> 718.26]  Who do they blame?
[720.54 --> 724.72]  I think the average Fortnite fan is going to blame Apple
[724.72 --> 726.86]  just because they want to play their game.
[727.02 --> 727.60]  But hold on.
[727.60 --> 729.20]  And there's going to be some tilting there.
[729.20 --> 730.92]  No, I want to argue with you.
[731.50 --> 731.86]  Because...
[732.86 --> 733.08]  Okay.
[733.08 --> 734.14]  Okay, let's...
[734.14 --> 735.22]  I hate to stereotype,
[735.82 --> 737.60]  but we're going to stereotype a little bit here.
[738.00 --> 739.82]  Who is the average Fortnite fan?
[739.90 --> 740.42]  How old are you?
[740.92 --> 741.24]  12?
[743.40 --> 744.08]  Somewhere between...
[744.08 --> 744.80]  Is this Google-able?
[744.92 --> 745.90]  10 and 14?
[746.24 --> 747.58]  You know, like you're...
[747.58 --> 751.52]  You're somewhere in like you have a lot of time to spend on your phone.
[751.52 --> 754.50]  You think a phone is a platform for like hardcore gaming
[754.50 --> 759.00]  and you like, you know, cartoony games like Fortnite or whatever.
[759.20 --> 759.94]  Like, I don't know.
[759.98 --> 760.22]  You like...
[760.22 --> 762.06]  You think dancing and game is really cool.
[762.16 --> 766.00]  Like, you're probably somewhere between like, you know, 9 and 25.
[766.38 --> 767.34]  Why don't we say that?
[767.68 --> 772.58]  So it says that 62.7% of the player base is 18 to 24,
[772.58 --> 776.94]  but they don't have any age group distribution that's below 18.
[777.32 --> 777.60]  Okay.
[777.60 --> 781.94]  So I think all their numbers are going to be wrong.
[782.18 --> 782.20]  Okay.
[782.28 --> 783.66]  So more than half are 24 and under.
[783.72 --> 784.50]  Why don't we call it that?
[784.92 --> 785.14]  Yeah.
[785.32 --> 785.84]  Okay, then.
[786.56 --> 788.26]  Now, let me hit you with this.
[788.26 --> 791.18]  The rabid Apple fanboys.
[791.50 --> 793.48]  You know, like I was reading a really interesting article
[793.48 --> 796.62]  about Apple's market share in the U.S.
[796.92 --> 798.88]  Like in high schools, for example.
[799.26 --> 801.26]  You can walk around a high school in the U.S.
[801.26 --> 803.44]  and it is hard to find an Android phone.
[803.76 --> 807.60]  Like that blue message bubble is a big deal.
[807.96 --> 810.34]  Like we even see posts on the forum about it and stuff.
[810.98 --> 811.78]  Like someone's like...
[811.78 --> 811.96]  In high schools?
[812.24 --> 812.38]  Yeah.
[812.38 --> 815.14]  Someone's like, you know, yeah, it's like crazy.
[815.22 --> 817.22]  My friends are all like, what's wrong with you?
[817.26 --> 818.44]  You got an Android phone.
[818.56 --> 819.92]  Like what are you, poor people or something?
[820.48 --> 823.16]  Because that's the thing about the iPhone is that...
[823.16 --> 824.72]  What's with all these balling parents?
[824.98 --> 826.24]  They're really expensive phones.
[826.30 --> 827.36]  Why are you buying that for your kids?
[827.36 --> 828.16]  I don't understand.
[828.48 --> 830.20]  Remember, there's a couple different factors here.
[830.20 --> 832.74]  So one, Apple has more affordable phones.
[833.44 --> 836.02]  Now, the XR is actually a great value
[836.02 --> 837.86]  considering it has a flagship processor in it.
[837.90 --> 838.70]  800 bucks.
[838.70 --> 841.92]  Don't forget that carrier subsidies are a big thing.
[842.58 --> 844.14]  So you buy an iPhone...
[844.14 --> 845.66]  Like what's an iPhone XR?
[846.22 --> 851.58]  iPhone XR Verizon three-year plan, right?
[851.72 --> 854.54]  So you buy an iPhone XR on a three-year plan from Verizon.
[854.66 --> 855.06]  Here we go.
[855.12 --> 856.08]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[856.70 --> 857.06]  I don't know.
[857.06 --> 859.50]  I'm not American, so I'm not familiar with this stuff
[859.50 --> 860.64]  off the top of my head here.
[861.80 --> 864.26]  It'd be great if this page would hurry up and load here.
[864.70 --> 866.86]  Okay, $20.83 a month.
[867.18 --> 869.30]  So that's what Apple has managed to do
[869.30 --> 871.34]  is they've managed to turn something
[871.34 --> 873.86]  that's actually very affordable
[873.86 --> 878.20]  if you have like even a small amount of income,
[878.36 --> 880.10]  like casual work on the side as a kid.
[880.40 --> 882.84]  And when you consider how much an iPhone
[882.84 --> 885.08]  or really any good phone can do,
[885.62 --> 889.02]  it's not unreasonable to spend that amount of your income
[889.02 --> 891.92]  on your phone, assuming you don't also need like,
[892.00 --> 893.26]  you know, a computer and laptop,
[893.60 --> 894.92]  like a desktop and a laptop
[894.92 --> 896.50]  and like all these other things.
[896.56 --> 899.46]  Like your iPhone might take the place of,
[899.60 --> 900.56]  you know, when we were kids,
[900.90 --> 903.18]  maybe you had a portable music player, right?
[903.32 --> 906.62]  Maybe you had a Game Boy or a PSP or Vita or whatever.
[907.50 --> 910.34]  Maybe you also had a flip cell phone or whatever.
[910.54 --> 913.74]  Like one device takes all those places.
[913.74 --> 916.14]  So even though like, you know,
[916.20 --> 918.16]  that kid at school that had a Discman
[918.16 --> 921.72]  and a portable game console, right?
[921.82 --> 924.40]  Might not be the most balling out kid ever.
[924.52 --> 925.46]  If they saved their pennies,
[925.56 --> 927.18]  they might have that stuff actually.
[927.32 --> 927.46]  Yeah.
[927.80 --> 930.02]  So yeah, it's not totally unreasonable
[930.02 --> 931.34]  for kids to have iPhones.
[931.72 --> 935.26]  So if we consider that this is the same demographic
[935.26 --> 937.22]  that religiously buys iPhones,
[937.72 --> 939.40]  do you want to change your answer?
[940.54 --> 940.98]  Hit me.
[940.98 --> 945.84]  I don't think so.
[946.34 --> 946.78]  Okay.
[946.86 --> 947.18]  Why?
[947.18 --> 948.76]  Most of the,
[948.86 --> 950.68]  so I've been following,
[950.90 --> 953.14]  I've been getting some flack from the audience
[953.14 --> 956.86]  on Twitter about apparently not knowing
[956.86 --> 958.94]  what I'm talking about in regards to
[958.94 --> 960.94]  what we've done with the iOS app,
[960.98 --> 963.86]  which I'm extremely excited to talk about shortly.
[964.94 --> 968.34]  But I've also been tagged
[968.34 --> 970.54]  in a lot of these discussion threads.
[970.98 --> 973.32]  Which I have never been involved with,
[973.82 --> 976.50]  but have gotten lots of notifications about them.
[976.50 --> 978.04]  So I've been kind of following along
[978.04 --> 980.08]  and people debating each other
[980.08 --> 981.82]  about Apple versus Fortnite.
[982.34 --> 983.46]  Oh, okay.
[983.76 --> 984.02]  Okay.
[984.20 --> 985.72]  There's three or four different threads
[985.72 --> 987.48]  where these like two Twitter dudes
[987.48 --> 988.84]  that I don't think have ever talked
[988.84 --> 989.58]  to each other before.
[989.72 --> 991.24]  I've just been going back and forth
[991.24 --> 992.08]  for like a week.
[992.18 --> 993.26]  One of them is like,
[993.44 --> 994.82]  I'm assuming hundreds of messages
[994.82 --> 995.82]  long at this point.
[995.82 --> 996.24]  Oh, wow.
[997.04 --> 1002.00]  And so far with my extremely limited view,
[1002.12 --> 1003.10]  I understand that.
[1004.20 --> 1006.70]  I have seen mostly like this guy's like,
[1006.78 --> 1007.52]  I play Fortnite
[1007.52 --> 1010.58]  and they are very much embracing
[1010.58 --> 1013.54]  the 1984 commercial.
[1013.96 --> 1014.22]  Yeah.
[1014.22 --> 1015.34]  Bring down the man.
[1015.34 --> 1018.60]  the 30% is crushing developers mentality,
[1018.60 --> 1019.58]  which I actually,
[1019.74 --> 1021.06]  I agree with quite a bit.
[1021.14 --> 1023.34]  30% is a ton.
[1023.60 --> 1024.00]  It's a lot.
[1024.80 --> 1027.52]  It's a massive amount to digest.
[1027.90 --> 1029.96]  So I get that part.
[1029.96 --> 1032.46]  And then most of the other side
[1032.46 --> 1033.50]  of the argument that I've been seeing
[1033.50 --> 1036.50]  has been entirely embracing Apple's messaging
[1036.50 --> 1041.92]  of security and just like ease of use
[1041.92 --> 1043.32]  for the user and security.
[1043.58 --> 1044.56]  And that's mostly it.
[1045.06 --> 1046.88]  I haven't seen a ton of like,
[1047.60 --> 1049.00]  oh, the 30% makes,
[1049.58 --> 1051.16]  that's what they should be making.
[1051.44 --> 1053.32]  There's, there has been some of that.
[1053.96 --> 1056.34]  But I think the majority of the argument
[1056.34 --> 1057.64]  that I've seen from that side
[1057.64 --> 1059.44]  has been the security and reliability
[1059.44 --> 1061.06]  of that payment processor.
[1061.06 --> 1062.52]  Now, to be clear,
[1062.72 --> 1064.40]  I don't disagree with you.
[1064.54 --> 1065.68]  I think you're probably right.
[1065.68 --> 1067.52]  I think that the relationship
[1067.52 --> 1070.30]  that Epic Games manages to build with customers
[1070.30 --> 1073.84]  or has managed to create with their customers
[1073.84 --> 1074.92]  over the last couple of years
[1074.92 --> 1076.08]  is absolutely incredible.
[1076.24 --> 1077.88]  They have done, hands down,
[1078.14 --> 1079.14]  a phenomenal job.
[1079.58 --> 1080.14]  100%.
[1080.14 --> 1082.04]  You can't, you can never take that away from them.
[1082.72 --> 1084.96]  And I think that most people
[1084.96 --> 1087.32]  will probably want to put pressure on Apple over this.
[1087.36 --> 1089.34]  And I also want to address
[1089.34 --> 1092.88]  some of the discussion around the 30%.
[1092.88 --> 1095.56]  Because I think what some people think
[1095.56 --> 1098.54]  is that this is all about 30%
[1098.54 --> 1100.08]  being the right number,
[1100.28 --> 1101.02]  according to Apple,
[1101.14 --> 1102.52]  and being the wrong number,
[1102.86 --> 1103.86]  according to Epic Games.
[1104.22 --> 1105.92]  But this is actually a much,
[1106.02 --> 1107.60]  much bigger conversation than that.
[1107.96 --> 1110.04]  The conversation is around
[1110.04 --> 1112.90]  Apple's monopolistic position in the market.
[1113.56 --> 1115.44]  It's around that that 30%
[1115.44 --> 1117.66]  is controlled by an entity
[1117.66 --> 1120.44]  that has far more power
[1120.44 --> 1124.40]  over the people that wouldn't like it
[1124.40 --> 1128.34]  than is fair in like a free and open market.
[1128.90 --> 1132.00]  So what Epic Games is saying
[1132.00 --> 1135.22]  is that, well, okay, fine.
[1135.28 --> 1138.70]  If you want to charge 30% on your Apple App Store,
[1139.04 --> 1140.50]  then power to you.
[1140.50 --> 1143.70]  But in order for this to not be a monopoly,
[1144.20 --> 1145.62]  because you, Apple,
[1145.72 --> 1148.34]  have so much market share in the mobile space,
[1148.84 --> 1150.12]  you're going to have to open it up
[1150.12 --> 1151.34]  to other app stores.
[1151.90 --> 1155.00]  Now, we would accept a lower percentage
[1155.00 --> 1156.60]  in the Apple App Store,
[1157.32 --> 1159.98]  but if you're not willing to yield on that,
[1160.08 --> 1161.38]  then we're going to go after you
[1161.38 --> 1163.66]  for what we perceive to be monopolistic behavior.
[1163.86 --> 1164.64]  And quite frankly,
[1164.96 --> 1166.56]  I think Apple's going to lose this fight.
[1166.56 --> 1169.50]  because it's exactly,
[1170.04 --> 1171.96]  I mean, it's exactly the kind of stuff
[1171.96 --> 1173.92]  that Apple used to sit on the sidelines
[1173.92 --> 1175.92]  being too small for anyone to care about
[1175.92 --> 1178.78]  when Microsoft was getting beat up for it
[1178.78 --> 1179.98]  by the European Union
[1179.98 --> 1181.80]  back in the early 2000s.
[1182.18 --> 1185.32]  Like, or throughout the 2000s, really, actually.
[1185.56 --> 1188.02]  But now that Apple's in this position of power,
[1188.36 --> 1191.06]  they have absolutely abused it.
[1191.06 --> 1193.06]  And so now they're just getting a taste
[1193.06 --> 1194.16]  of their own medicine, really.
[1194.16 --> 1196.94]  In my limited opinion,
[1197.28 --> 1200.90]  I think Microsoft was actually in less violation
[1200.90 --> 1203.70]  of this type of stuff than Apple currently is in.
[1204.36 --> 1206.86]  And I think America and a lot of other countries
[1206.86 --> 1207.96]  have sat on their butts
[1207.96 --> 1210.84]  in terms of antitrust laws for a very long time.
[1211.40 --> 1215.50]  And this might be the reawakening
[1215.50 --> 1217.12]  of those types of enforcement
[1217.12 --> 1219.18]  because it's gotten a little ridiculous,
[1219.52 --> 1221.14]  especially with mobile platforms.
[1221.14 --> 1223.78]  So I guess this is a perfect segue
[1223.78 --> 1226.02]  into all the people.
[1226.24 --> 1227.12]  I got such a kick.
[1227.20 --> 1228.96]  You know, it wasn't just on Twitter throughout the week.
[1229.02 --> 1230.62]  It was in the chat last week as well
[1230.62 --> 1234.34]  about how stupid you guys were thinking
[1234.34 --> 1236.02]  that submitting an iOS app
[1236.02 --> 1237.70]  should work the way that you think it should work.
[1238.10 --> 1239.94]  And if you had any experience,
[1239.94 --> 1241.46]  you would have obviously known
[1241.46 --> 1243.16]  that what you guys were doing was wrong.
[1243.16 --> 1246.62]  There was a ton of that in the chat last week.
[1246.84 --> 1247.82]  Oh, it's been a lot.
[1248.08 --> 1248.26]  Yeah.
[1248.34 --> 1250.86]  We should give a short recap.
[1251.16 --> 1253.96]  Basically, the Floatplane app got pulled
[1253.96 --> 1256.94]  because Apple was complaining that...
[1257.70 --> 1259.52]  I mean, what even were they?
[1259.60 --> 1262.58]  Basically, they thought that the Floatplane app
[1262.58 --> 1264.14]  was not doing a good enough job
[1264.14 --> 1267.90]  of A, protecting users from user-generated content.
[1268.28 --> 1270.22]  So that was in the form of comments under the videos.
[1270.82 --> 1272.04]  Honestly, I almost forgot about that
[1272.04 --> 1273.06]  because that was a long time ago.
[1273.14 --> 1274.28]  But yes, that was a big thing.
[1274.36 --> 1275.04]  So there was that.
[1275.42 --> 1277.74]  There was also that they complained
[1277.74 --> 1280.36]  that Floatplane was a pay platform
[1280.36 --> 1284.40]  where the subscriptions were taking place off the app
[1284.40 --> 1286.56]  where Apple was not getting their 30% cut.
[1286.94 --> 1289.68]  So Luke and the team over at Floatplane
[1289.68 --> 1292.68]  tried every which way to get it approved,
[1292.76 --> 1294.72]  even going as far as to remove commenting
[1294.72 --> 1297.04]  from the iOS app and...
[1298.04 --> 1298.88]  We removed commenting.
[1299.20 --> 1300.98]  We removed every single reference
[1300.98 --> 1304.58]  to Floatplane.com from the entire app,
[1304.64 --> 1306.42]  including all FAQs,
[1306.72 --> 1307.94]  all support links,
[1308.38 --> 1309.04]  everything else.
[1309.20 --> 1311.70]  There are support links still there.
[1311.84 --> 1313.64]  They're just not to Floatplane.com,
[1313.76 --> 1317.46]  which to me is a minor security issue,
[1317.54 --> 1318.30]  but that's fine.
[1318.68 --> 1320.12]  I would feel awkward
[1320.12 --> 1322.28]  not going to Floatplane.com
[1322.28 --> 1323.96]  to get support or FAQs,
[1324.30 --> 1325.52]  but whatever.
[1325.66 --> 1327.58]  If they're going to try to defend security issues
[1327.58 --> 1328.18]  for the payment thing,
[1328.26 --> 1329.04]  whatever, I'll move on.
[1329.04 --> 1330.88]  We did a lot of stuff.
[1330.96 --> 1332.48]  There was a lot of iterations
[1332.48 --> 1334.60]  trying to get this through the App Store,
[1335.04 --> 1338.10]  but we got to the point
[1338.10 --> 1340.30]  where the denials that they were sending us,
[1342.02 --> 1343.44]  even really early on,
[1343.54 --> 1344.76]  they were super cryptic,
[1344.92 --> 1347.36]  which is an extremely frustrating thing to deal with.
[1347.50 --> 1350.38]  If someone's trying to give you feedback
[1350.38 --> 1351.74]  about something that you're doing,
[1352.04 --> 1353.88]  and they try to give you that feedback in a riddle,
[1353.88 --> 1356.10]  why?
[1356.90 --> 1358.04]  That's just really annoying.
[1358.26 --> 1360.34]  You'd rather just fix the problem and move on.
[1360.58 --> 1363.44]  Honestly, if they had some issues with our app,
[1364.10 --> 1365.98]  it's your platform, buddy.
[1365.98 --> 1367.28]  Just tell us what it is.
[1367.68 --> 1368.78]  We can fix some problems.
[1369.32 --> 1372.66]  It just started to feel like they didn't want us to fix it.
[1372.66 --> 1373.30]  Yes.
[1373.82 --> 1379.28]  And that got to the point where we had done so much due diligence
[1379.28 --> 1381.70]  that the things that they were claiming
[1381.70 --> 1384.66]  were actually just factually not true.
[1385.50 --> 1385.60]  Yeah.
[1385.76 --> 1389.90]  We had removed the app heal
[1389.90 --> 1392.00]  and asked for a callback.
[1392.38 --> 1393.16]  So they would call me,
[1393.42 --> 1394.30]  which, by the way,
[1394.34 --> 1395.42]  is a terrible system
[1395.42 --> 1397.66]  because you can't set up like,
[1398.14 --> 1399.82]  they don't call you through
[1399.82 --> 1402.02]  like the dashboard.
[1402.22 --> 1402.84]  You can't set up a company.
[1402.90 --> 1404.10]  They just call your cell phone
[1404.10 --> 1405.58]  at some random time
[1405.58 --> 1407.58]  within three to five days,
[1407.94 --> 1409.66]  which absolutely didn't happen.
[1410.28 --> 1412.24]  They called me today,
[1412.56 --> 1414.02]  which I was expecting a call last week.
[1414.02 --> 1414.84]  Seven days later.
[1415.06 --> 1415.88]  So 12 days.
[1416.14 --> 1416.32]  Yeah.
[1416.54 --> 1417.40]  It's ridiculous.
[1417.60 --> 1419.16]  Well, three to five business days, to be fair,
[1419.28 --> 1420.60]  but they were still super late.
[1421.14 --> 1422.58]  But yeah, we got the call.
[1422.58 --> 1425.14]  The guy on the phone said,
[1425.28 --> 1428.68]  I reviewed your app before calling you
[1428.68 --> 1430.42]  and you're correct.
[1430.60 --> 1432.54]  Your app is in fact not in violation
[1432.54 --> 1433.62]  of anything on the store.
[1434.32 --> 1435.64]  We're going to be reinstating you.
[1435.70 --> 1437.36]  It was like a 35 second call.
[1438.62 --> 1441.72]  So the Flowplane app is,
[1442.78 --> 1445.72]  the status on the dashboard is ready for sale
[1445.72 --> 1447.10]  and it is currently rolling out.
[1447.30 --> 1448.88]  And we have changed nothing
[1448.88 --> 1451.26]  in the last like many weeks.
[1451.26 --> 1452.94]  So thank you all the experts
[1452.94 --> 1454.70]  who were 100% sure
[1454.70 --> 1456.12]  that Luke and his team
[1456.12 --> 1457.86]  had no idea what they were doing.
[1458.80 --> 1460.90]  Apparently, you know,
[1461.46 --> 1462.60]  you can keep your expertise
[1462.60 --> 1464.00]  to yourself next time
[1464.00 --> 1465.74]  and that would be best.
[1466.24 --> 1467.50]  Look, it's one of those things.
[1467.60 --> 1468.12]  I get it.
[1468.44 --> 1468.92]  I get it.
[1468.98 --> 1469.78]  I've run my mouth.
[1469.96 --> 1471.08]  I've run my mouth before.
[1471.40 --> 1472.80]  I've had to make apology videos.
[1473.34 --> 1474.08]  You know, I get it.
[1474.12 --> 1474.54]  I get it.
[1474.56 --> 1475.60]  It's not fun.
[1475.74 --> 1476.52]  It's a hard position,
[1476.52 --> 1477.88]  but you were wrong
[1477.88 --> 1479.56]  and the Flowplane app was fine
[1479.56 --> 1481.24]  and Apple was just,
[1481.32 --> 1481.78]  I don't know,
[1481.98 --> 1484.48]  is it malice or incompetence at this point?
[1484.54 --> 1485.48]  What do you attribute this to?
[1485.66 --> 1488.46]  I'm thinking incompetence.
[1488.60 --> 1489.54]  You're thinking incompetence?
[1489.62 --> 1490.68]  Giving them the benefit of the doubt.
[1490.76 --> 1491.26]  I like it.
[1491.42 --> 1492.18]  I like it.
[1492.52 --> 1495.22]  The way a lot of the messages were worded even,
[1495.80 --> 1497.20]  it really felt like they...
[1498.56 --> 1500.02]  Just had no idea what's going on.
[1500.22 --> 1502.76]  Had no clue what they were looking at
[1502.76 --> 1503.82]  or what they were doing
[1503.82 --> 1505.76]  or possibly what day it was.
[1505.76 --> 1507.50]  And they were just being like,
[1507.62 --> 1510.00]  boop, denied without looking into anything.
[1510.20 --> 1512.68]  My favorite was when you literally ripped off
[1512.68 --> 1515.06]  the messaging from the Netflix app
[1515.06 --> 1520.02]  for like how registrations off app would work.
[1520.16 --> 1521.04]  And they were like,
[1521.22 --> 1522.44]  this wording is unacceptable.
[1522.82 --> 1525.92]  And it was like you had changed like Netflix to Floatplane.
[1526.06 --> 1527.80]  I mean, not because we wanted to,
[1528.06 --> 1528.66]  to be clear.
[1528.66 --> 1530.78]  We're not trying to like steal Netflix's.
[1530.98 --> 1532.98]  We're just trying to get the app on the store.
[1532.98 --> 1535.48]  And clearly Netflix is on the store.
[1535.62 --> 1537.82]  So if that word is okay for Netflix,
[1538.00 --> 1539.12]  it should be okay for us.
[1539.20 --> 1539.80]  But it wasn't.
[1540.30 --> 1540.94]  But it is.
[1541.50 --> 1542.48]  And it probably was.
[1542.56 --> 1544.30]  And that's actually something I want to bring up too
[1544.30 --> 1547.08]  is like we definitely went too far
[1547.08 --> 1549.68]  because I don't know where the line was anymore
[1549.68 --> 1552.34]  because clearly we passed it at some point.
[1552.54 --> 1555.76]  But now we can do bug fixes
[1555.76 --> 1559.30]  as long as we put that in our change log
[1559.30 --> 1561.34]  and we can like change stuff, right?
[1561.34 --> 1563.80]  Well, yeah, now we can actually make it
[1563.80 --> 1566.34]  so that people on the iOS app
[1566.34 --> 1569.22]  can actually see the new types of content
[1569.22 --> 1571.22]  that are able to be posted onto Floatplane,
[1571.36 --> 1572.22]  which is good
[1572.22 --> 1574.50]  because it just didn't work anymore
[1574.50 --> 1576.92]  because we had moved so far past the feature set
[1576.92 --> 1578.70]  that we had months ago,
[1578.80 --> 1579.78]  which was the last time
[1579.78 --> 1580.82]  that they actually allowed us
[1580.82 --> 1582.96]  to update the freaking app.
[1583.62 --> 1586.70]  And now we can try to crawl back,
[1587.12 --> 1588.32]  add some more features.
[1588.62 --> 1590.56]  I want to try to get comments back in the app.
[1590.56 --> 1591.60]  Comments would be nice.
[1591.84 --> 1593.24]  The Floatplane comments are so nice.
[1593.94 --> 1594.14]  Yeah.
[1594.76 --> 1597.16]  And we like have the moderation and stuff
[1597.16 --> 1598.08]  that they were asking for.
[1598.18 --> 1599.50]  Like we literally do.
[1599.80 --> 1600.66]  And we told them that
[1600.66 --> 1601.38]  and they're just like, no.
[1601.96 --> 1603.58]  So I'm going to try to walk back
[1603.58 --> 1604.36]  some of these features,
[1604.48 --> 1606.74]  but we're going to do it step by step,
[1606.82 --> 1608.46]  trying to add only one thing at a time
[1608.46 --> 1610.04]  so we can very easily tell
[1610.04 --> 1612.12]  what caused denials and whatnot.
[1612.34 --> 1614.68]  And we'll grow the feature set over there
[1614.68 --> 1616.74]  and make it a bit easier and better to use.
[1616.98 --> 1617.60]  But yeah.
[1617.80 --> 1619.12]  I don't know when it's going to be live,
[1619.12 --> 1619.80]  but it's coming.
[1620.06 --> 1621.86]  Hugo Calveron says,
[1622.10 --> 1624.44]  okay, I'm filing a lawsuit against you
[1624.44 --> 1625.84]  for not letting me put my images
[1625.84 --> 1627.58]  on your merch at Linus Tech Tips.
[1628.52 --> 1630.10]  You got some reading to do.
[1633.16 --> 1635.22]  That's really not how this works.
[1637.50 --> 1640.74]  That's not how antitrust law works.
[1640.82 --> 1642.12]  I'm not an expert, but...
[1642.66 --> 1643.92]  But that ain't it, Chief.
[1643.92 --> 1646.28]  That ain't it, Chief.
[1648.04 --> 1648.66]  All right.
[1648.70 --> 1652.10]  Why don't we jump into our headline topic for the day?
[1655.10 --> 1658.24]  NVIDIA confirming the new 12-volt connector.
[1658.38 --> 1659.88]  This is great because I remember
[1659.88 --> 1661.58]  commenting on the rumors
[1661.58 --> 1664.38]  and then having someone come out very confidently
[1664.38 --> 1666.84]  and correct me that it was proven to be false.
[1667.68 --> 1668.12]  Nope.
[1668.32 --> 1668.64]  Nope.
[1668.74 --> 1669.30]  It's real.
[1669.30 --> 1671.20]  Illegal Water on the forums posted it
[1671.20 --> 1673.24]  after many weeks of rumors and speculation.
[1673.44 --> 1674.82]  The new 12-pin connector
[1674.82 --> 1677.58]  has finally been confirmed by Team Green,
[1677.90 --> 1680.38]  as has the inclusion of an 8-pin adapter
[1680.38 --> 1682.66]  with RTX 3000 GPUs.
[1682.66 --> 1685.48]  So it's not that you are going to necessarily
[1685.48 --> 1688.32]  have to change out your power supply.
[1689.34 --> 1692.36]  It's just that if you want to run a native connection
[1692.36 --> 1693.46]  between your power supply
[1693.46 --> 1695.24]  and your fancy new graphics card,
[1695.38 --> 1698.02]  you are going to have to change out your power supply.
[1698.02 --> 1700.02]  Now, what's cool...
[1700.02 --> 1700.18]  One quick second.
[1700.26 --> 1700.72]  One quick second.
[1700.84 --> 1701.78]  I want to interject really quickly.
[1701.94 --> 1702.06]  Yeah.
[1702.28 --> 1703.26]  A bunch of people are saying
[1703.26 --> 1705.72]  the app is on the App Store now.
[1705.86 --> 1706.46]  Oh, groovy.
[1706.72 --> 1708.06]  One thing you want to look for
[1708.06 --> 1710.48]  because it is actually showing up properly on my end,
[1710.72 --> 1714.16]  but you want to look for version 0.3.1
[1714.16 --> 1715.86]  because in this process,
[1715.86 --> 1719.26]  we had actually re-enabled the old Janky app.
[1719.52 --> 1720.94]  I just not told anyone that it was there
[1720.94 --> 1722.94]  because we were trying to get something to work.
[1723.08 --> 1723.32]  Right.
[1723.60 --> 1726.38]  So yeah, you're looking for version 0.3.1.
[1726.38 --> 1728.46]  If it's version 1.something,
[1728.72 --> 1730.84]  yes, we did that many revisions.
[1732.40 --> 1734.28]  Sorry, 0.1.something,
[1734.64 --> 1735.80]  that is the wrong one
[1735.80 --> 1737.32]  and it hasn't propagated in your area.
[1737.52 --> 1738.92]  If it shows 0.3.1,
[1739.18 --> 1740.00]  that is the right one.
[1740.12 --> 1741.52]  It is extremely cut down
[1741.52 --> 1742.84]  and very bare bones.
[1743.44 --> 1744.84]  We will be adding features over time.
[1744.92 --> 1745.56]  Yeah, we're sorry.
[1745.66 --> 1746.80]  It's not our choice.
[1747.16 --> 1748.06]  It was not our choice.
[1748.24 --> 1748.54]  All right.
[1748.62 --> 1750.94]  Back to the new connector.
[1751.16 --> 1752.14]  So one of the cool things
[1752.14 --> 1753.82]  that's happened over the last 10 years, though,
[1753.82 --> 1756.88]  is the proliferation of modular power supplies.
[1757.32 --> 1760.46]  Now, back when modular power supplies first showed up,
[1760.52 --> 1763.12]  I remember one of the talking points
[1763.12 --> 1764.70]  that I would often bring up for them
[1764.70 --> 1767.02]  is that what's cool about a modular power supply
[1767.02 --> 1769.56]  is that if the connector standards change,
[1770.22 --> 1771.60]  all you have to do is change a cable.
[1771.98 --> 1774.20]  You don't actually have to change out your power supply.
[1774.44 --> 1776.06]  And to be honest with you,
[1776.40 --> 1778.04]  it's been so long
[1778.04 --> 1780.46]  since any PC power connector has changed,
[1780.84 --> 1782.02]  I totally forgot about that.
[1782.02 --> 1783.56]  But here we are,
[1783.80 --> 1784.72]  RTX 3000,
[1784.98 --> 1787.82]  new 12-volt connectors with 12 pins.
[1788.38 --> 1790.42]  And if you've got a modular power supply,
[1790.62 --> 1792.32]  either through your power supply manufacturer
[1792.32 --> 1793.58]  or through a third party,
[1793.82 --> 1795.14]  there is a solid chance
[1795.14 --> 1797.28]  that you'll be able to just upgrade your power supply
[1797.28 --> 1800.20]  so you can have a straight 12-pin connection
[1800.20 --> 1801.42]  right into your graphics card
[1801.42 --> 1802.32]  to look nice and clean.
[1802.94 --> 1804.84]  So in a video uploaded on Wednesday,
[1805.02 --> 1806.68]  NVIDIA detailed the design processes
[1806.68 --> 1808.30]  for past and present GPUs
[1808.30 --> 1809.48]  along with the challenges faced
[1809.48 --> 1811.66]  in powering and cooling high-end graphics.
[1812.02 --> 1814.64]  Man, the 3090 looks flipping huge.
[1814.80 --> 1816.42]  It's like 2080 Ti
[1816.42 --> 1818.30]  and then next to it like a 3090.
[1818.42 --> 1819.32]  It's like this big.
[1819.58 --> 1821.82]  It's crazy because it's tall, it's long.
[1822.42 --> 1823.70]  The new 12-pin connector
[1823.70 --> 1827.00]  is actually much smaller than two 8-pins
[1827.00 --> 1828.84]  and is oriented vertically
[1828.84 --> 1830.78]  and angled 45 degrees
[1830.78 --> 1833.72]  for reasons that I'm sure make sense to NVIDIA.
[1834.34 --> 1835.38]  We should actually, here,
[1835.44 --> 1837.02]  we should grab a picture.
[1837.18 --> 1839.60]  Why don't we fire up Anand Tech?
[1840.32 --> 1841.12]  There we go.
[1841.20 --> 1841.90]  NVIDIA confirms.
[1842.06 --> 1842.44]  Ah!
[1842.92 --> 1845.54]  Written by the one and only Dr. Cutris.
[1846.00 --> 1846.54]  What's up, Ian?
[1847.26 --> 1848.82]  Check him out at Tech Tech Potato.
[1849.24 --> 1850.56]  Tech Tech Potato on YouTube.
[1851.32 --> 1851.68]  All right.
[1851.78 --> 1853.24]  So here's the PCB.
[1853.60 --> 1855.06]  You gotta love that, you know,
[1855.58 --> 1858.24]  bullet exit wound PCB shape
[1858.24 --> 1859.02]  they got going on here.
[1859.08 --> 1859.88]  That's because there's a fan
[1859.88 --> 1861.20]  blowing right through the cooler here.
[1861.58 --> 1862.66]  And then there it is.
[1863.30 --> 1865.56]  Single 12-pin connector
[1865.56 --> 1867.02]  coming out at this angle
[1867.02 --> 1869.60]  that I guess is good for cable management
[1869.60 --> 1870.14]  or something?
[1872.02 --> 1873.24]  Perpendicular to the PCB,
[1873.48 --> 1874.76]  which is very peculiar indeed.
[1874.88 --> 1874.98]  Yeah.
[1875.10 --> 1875.88]  Ooh, there it is.
[1875.96 --> 1878.04]  NVIDIA 12-pin right there.
[1878.48 --> 1880.16]  It's gonna look a little something like that.
[1880.94 --> 1882.02]  NVIDIA states in the video
[1882.02 --> 1883.42]  that this 12-pin design
[1883.42 --> 1885.20]  is of its own creation
[1885.20 --> 1887.40]  and we have no idea
[1887.40 --> 1889.48]  if this is going to actually become
[1889.48 --> 1890.40]  an industry standard
[1890.40 --> 1891.82]  for it to happen,
[1892.10 --> 1894.10]  AMD would probably have to adopt it.
[1894.20 --> 1895.50]  And hey, I mean, Intel at this point,
[1895.52 --> 1896.16]  if they ever launch
[1896.16 --> 1897.02]  their dedicated graphics,
[1897.76 --> 1900.68]  I could see AMD
[1900.68 --> 1902.24]  potentially getting behind
[1902.24 --> 1903.02]  something like this
[1903.02 --> 1905.20]  if it is a genuine improvement
[1905.20 --> 1906.64]  in experience for the viewer,
[1907.40 --> 1908.78]  for the viewer, for the user.
[1909.18 --> 1910.50]  Having just one connector
[1910.50 --> 1912.74]  go into a high-end graphics card
[1912.74 --> 1914.14]  would be pretty sweet.
[1914.52 --> 1916.26]  Again, just from like a cable management
[1916.26 --> 1917.40]  and ease of use standpoint.
[1918.68 --> 1919.64]  So we'll see.
[1919.76 --> 1920.24]  We'll see.
[1920.34 --> 1920.94]  But in the meantime,
[1921.52 --> 1924.46]  you can use the dual 8-pin
[1924.46 --> 1926.44]  to single 12-pin adapter
[1926.44 --> 1928.32]  that is going to be included
[1928.32 --> 1930.60]  with these RTX 3000 series graphics cards.
[1931.18 --> 1931.98]  So you like it?
[1932.22 --> 1933.20]  I like it.
[1933.24 --> 1933.70]  I like it.
[1933.74 --> 1934.44]  It's smaller.
[1934.70 --> 1936.50]  It can carry, quote unquote,
[1936.88 --> 1938.56]  much more power.
[1939.54 --> 1940.80]  Igor's Labs assessment
[1940.80 --> 1942.54]  previously was that
[1942.54 --> 1944.76]  it could carry up to 600 watts.
[1944.76 --> 1946.48]  So that's basically
[1946.48 --> 1949.40]  all we are realistically going to need
[1949.40 --> 1952.50]  because cooling 600 watts
[1952.50 --> 1954.84]  in a graphics card form factor
[1954.84 --> 1956.52]  or more than 600 watts
[1956.52 --> 1957.74]  is not happening.
[1960.02 --> 1961.10]  We've got some new...
[1961.10 --> 1961.58]  I think it's awesome.
[1961.86 --> 1962.70]  I'm...
[1962.70 --> 1966.18]  I've always had at least a minor issue
[1966.18 --> 1967.14]  with PCIe power,
[1967.42 --> 1970.00]  especially when they just use 6-pins
[1970.00 --> 1972.76]  because then you have that super annoying...
[1972.76 --> 1973.64]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1973.98 --> 1974.92]  I'm excited for this.
[1974.98 --> 1976.14]  I like the one cable run.
[1976.26 --> 1977.32]  I think cable management guys
[1977.32 --> 1978.12]  are going to love this.
[1978.60 --> 1978.98]  Yep.
[1979.34 --> 1979.52]  Good.
[1979.88 --> 1980.18]  It's good.
[1980.50 --> 1980.68]  Yep.
[1980.88 --> 1982.64]  And without over-engineering it
[1982.64 --> 1983.74]  to the point where you have
[1983.74 --> 1985.74]  like a super long PCI Express slot,
[1985.82 --> 1986.40]  Apple style,
[1986.40 --> 1988.12]  this is fine.
[1988.32 --> 1988.96]  This is fine.
[1989.06 --> 1990.98]  One cable seems like a good compromise.
[1991.76 --> 1993.44]  NVIDIA gave some new details
[1993.44 --> 1994.66]  about the cooler.
[1994.66 --> 1997.60]  So the air will be drawn up
[1997.60 --> 1998.84]  from the bottom fan
[1998.84 --> 2000.92]  through the V-shaped PCB.
[2001.24 --> 2002.26]  So when they say V-shaped,
[2002.34 --> 2003.38]  they mean with like this
[2003.38 --> 2005.14]  like cutout on the one side.
[2005.22 --> 2006.58]  So up through that
[2006.58 --> 2008.46]  and heatsink fans
[2008.46 --> 2009.42]  and then up and out
[2009.42 --> 2010.54]  through the top fan
[2010.54 --> 2012.20]  to exhaust with the CPU
[2012.20 --> 2012.90]  and rear case fan.
[2012.96 --> 2014.52]  So it'll come like up
[2014.52 --> 2015.80]  and then like out
[2015.80 --> 2016.94]  or something apparently.
[2018.38 --> 2018.90]  Okay.
[2020.12 --> 2020.68]  Fascinating.
[2021.48 --> 2023.00]  So we've got a sneak peek
[2023.00 --> 2024.66]  of what the cooler looks like
[2024.66 --> 2025.64]  flashed at the end
[2025.64 --> 2026.46]  of the video here.
[2026.56 --> 2027.28]  So let's go ahead
[2027.28 --> 2028.50]  and get my...
[2028.50 --> 2029.28]  Oh, wow.
[2029.46 --> 2029.86]  Okay.
[2031.48 --> 2032.18]  Ah, whatever.
[2032.30 --> 2032.68]  Good enough.
[2032.76 --> 2033.00]  Okay.
[2033.24 --> 2034.20]  So here, let's go back.
[2035.26 --> 2035.84]  There we go.
[2036.54 --> 2037.10]  That was it.
[2037.92 --> 2038.86]  Yeah, that really is...
[2038.86 --> 2040.08]  That's a sneak...
[2040.08 --> 2040.60]  Whoops.
[2040.72 --> 2041.60]  That's a sneak peek
[2041.60 --> 2042.22]  and a half there,
[2042.26 --> 2042.80]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2043.72 --> 2044.32]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2044.46 --> 2045.94]  Old, old, old graphics.
[2046.18 --> 2046.70]  Old graphics.
[2046.84 --> 2047.42]  Old news.
[2047.74 --> 2048.94]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2048.94 --> 2049.56]  Get on with it.
[2049.98 --> 2050.48]  Here we go.
[2051.62 --> 2052.82]  Okay, so let's blow
[2052.82 --> 2053.86]  into the thing
[2053.86 --> 2054.56]  and then we get...
[2054.56 --> 2055.30]  Oh, really?
[2055.44 --> 2055.84]  That's it?
[2056.04 --> 2056.34]  Wow.
[2056.54 --> 2056.84]  All right.
[2056.90 --> 2058.32]  That was totally
[2058.32 --> 2059.02]  10 out of 10.
[2059.06 --> 2059.62]  Not worth it.
[2059.90 --> 2060.54]  Not worth it.
[2060.86 --> 2061.90]  I regret clicking on it.
[2062.54 --> 2063.46]  So there's an event
[2063.46 --> 2065.68]  called GeForce Ultimate Countdown
[2065.68 --> 2067.40]  scheduled for September 1st,
[2067.40 --> 2069.22]  which would lead us
[2069.22 --> 2070.90]  to assume that there's
[2070.90 --> 2071.76]  going to be some kind
[2071.76 --> 2072.72]  of news about this
[2072.72 --> 2074.62]  very, very, very, very,
[2074.62 --> 2075.44]  very soon.
[2076.50 --> 2077.42]  I'm jazzed.
[2077.46 --> 2077.96]  I'm jazzed.
[2077.96 --> 2078.58]  I can't wait
[2078.58 --> 2080.72]  for $1,400 US dollar
[2080.72 --> 2082.64]  top-tier graphics cards.
[2084.14 --> 2084.62]  You know that's
[2084.62 --> 2085.28]  the rumored pricing,
[2085.36 --> 2085.68]  right, Luke?
[2087.08 --> 2087.60]  Yeah.
[2088.14 --> 2089.92]  I definitely
[2089.92 --> 2091.18]  won't be springing for that.
[2091.26 --> 2091.82]  You know what's
[2091.82 --> 2092.74]  the worst part
[2092.74 --> 2094.48]  about new graphics cards
[2094.48 --> 2095.86]  being so much more expensive
[2095.86 --> 2096.78]  than the previous gen?
[2097.94 --> 2099.34]  The previous gen
[2099.34 --> 2100.36]  will maintain price.
[2100.72 --> 2101.20]  Yeah.
[2101.46 --> 2101.94]  Yeah, that.
[2102.04 --> 2102.34]  Yeah.
[2102.34 --> 2103.52]  That's the worst part
[2103.52 --> 2104.30]  because that was
[2104.30 --> 2105.12]  always my strat.
[2105.38 --> 2106.46]  Like, back when I was
[2106.46 --> 2106.82]  a student,
[2107.06 --> 2108.54]  that was always my strat
[2108.54 --> 2109.44]  was high-end,
[2109.76 --> 2111.04]  last-gen for cheap.
[2111.12 --> 2112.08]  It's such a good one.
[2112.16 --> 2113.46]  You get really solid,
[2113.70 --> 2115.14]  very stable drivers
[2115.14 --> 2117.02]  that are mature.
[2117.26 --> 2117.92]  So the graphics card
[2117.92 --> 2118.78]  is going to have
[2118.78 --> 2119.60]  better performance
[2119.60 --> 2120.32]  in the applications
[2120.32 --> 2121.42]  that you're using it in
[2121.42 --> 2122.56]  than on launch day,
[2122.72 --> 2123.74]  almost certainly.
[2124.78 --> 2125.80]  Or at least less flakiness.
[2126.84 --> 2127.12]  Yeah.
[2127.32 --> 2127.48]  Yeah.
[2127.48 --> 2129.00]  It makes a lot of sense.
[2129.06 --> 2130.18]  It's not so old.
[2130.18 --> 2131.54]  It's not so old
[2131.54 --> 2132.52]  that they can justify
[2132.52 --> 2133.68]  just kind of
[2133.68 --> 2135.20]  not paying attention to it.
[2135.30 --> 2135.74]  Right?
[2135.82 --> 2135.96]  Yeah.
[2136.10 --> 2137.50]  So it's like new enough
[2137.50 --> 2138.60]  that you're still getting
[2138.60 --> 2139.92]  all the bug fixes
[2139.92 --> 2141.40]  and like game day drivers
[2141.40 --> 2142.70]  for like hot new games
[2142.70 --> 2143.64]  and all that kind of stuff.
[2143.96 --> 2145.00]  And if you do your flip
[2145.00 --> 2145.98]  every time,
[2146.40 --> 2147.78]  it's still not so old
[2147.78 --> 2149.00]  that no one's interested in it.
[2149.46 --> 2150.42]  People are still
[2150.42 --> 2150.94]  going to be interested
[2150.94 --> 2151.44]  in that card
[2151.44 --> 2152.24]  because it's still
[2152.24 --> 2153.58]  worth something.
[2154.24 --> 2154.46]  Yep.
[2155.26 --> 2156.24]  Not so much.
[2156.32 --> 2156.50]  I mean,
[2156.50 --> 2157.40]  as long as NVIDIA
[2157.40 --> 2158.28]  keeps delivering
[2158.28 --> 2159.74]  higher graphics performance
[2159.74 --> 2161.38]  and charging more for it,
[2161.82 --> 2162.66]  it's just basically
[2162.66 --> 2164.64]  1080 Ti's
[2164.64 --> 2165.38]  are going to be worth
[2165.38 --> 2166.86]  a ton of money forever
[2166.86 --> 2168.72]  as far as I can tell.
[2169.14 --> 2169.60]  Like,
[2169.64 --> 2170.86]  when did the 1080 Ti
[2170.86 --> 2171.38]  come out?
[2172.38 --> 2173.12]  Graphics card tech
[2173.12 --> 2174.10]  is moving so slowly
[2174.10 --> 2174.64]  these days.
[2175.40 --> 2176.48]  They still go for
[2176.48 --> 2179.20]  450 to 500 US dollars
[2179.20 --> 2180.18]  on eBay.
[2181.18 --> 2182.26]  They came out
[2182.26 --> 2184.78]  March 10th, 2017.
[2185.66 --> 2186.72]  Come on!
[2186.72 --> 2189.42]  Come on!
[2189.98 --> 2191.18]  That was three and a half
[2191.18 --> 2191.94]  years ago!
[2192.42 --> 2193.16]  Imagine buying
[2193.16 --> 2194.14]  a three and a half
[2194.14 --> 2195.28]  year old graphics card
[2195.28 --> 2196.44]  for what you said
[2196.44 --> 2197.54]  over $400, right?
[2197.88 --> 2198.34]  Mm-hmm.
[2198.84 --> 2199.66]  In the like
[2199.66 --> 2201.46]  8800 GTX era.
[2202.30 --> 2202.72]  But...
[2202.72 --> 2204.80]  No way!
[2205.14 --> 2206.24]  Even if you scale
[2206.24 --> 2207.26]  that pricing for inflation
[2207.26 --> 2207.66]  to whatever,
[2207.84 --> 2208.94]  it's still ridiculous.
[2209.18 --> 2209.42]  No,
[2209.50 --> 2210.54]  there's no way.
[2210.68 --> 2211.68]  We actually did
[2211.68 --> 2212.78]  a really fun build
[2212.78 --> 2213.40]  this week.
[2213.52 --> 2214.36]  That video is going
[2214.36 --> 2215.00]  to be coming up
[2215.00 --> 2215.52]  probably sometime
[2215.52 --> 2216.16]  in the next week
[2216.16 --> 2216.54]  or two
[2216.54 --> 2218.04]  where we used
[2218.04 --> 2219.02]  the Wayback Machine,
[2219.18 --> 2219.36]  you know,
[2219.38 --> 2220.22]  the Internet Archive,
[2220.72 --> 2221.64]  to go shopping
[2221.64 --> 2222.72]  on NCIX
[2222.72 --> 2223.80]  in December,
[2224.04 --> 2225.54]  Christmastime 2005.
[2226.20 --> 2227.16]  That was my idea,
[2227.24 --> 2227.54]  wasn't it?
[2227.74 --> 2228.16]  Was it?
[2228.62 --> 2229.22]  Well, we did it.
[2229.66 --> 2230.82]  I didn't credit you.
[2230.98 --> 2231.32]  I'm sorry.
[2231.40 --> 2232.20]  I totally forgot
[2232.20 --> 2232.86]  you pitched it.
[2233.24 --> 2234.30]  I'm sorry, Luke.
[2234.52 --> 2235.36]  Please forgive me.
[2235.58 --> 2236.14]  Forgive me.
[2236.28 --> 2237.18]  I think we were
[2237.18 --> 2238.08]  Wayback Machining
[2238.08 --> 2239.42]  NCIX on the WAN show
[2239.42 --> 2240.14]  and I said,
[2240.26 --> 2240.42]  like,
[2240.48 --> 2241.42]  you should pick parts
[2241.42 --> 2241.80]  from here.
[2241.92 --> 2242.14]  It'd be fun.
[2242.16 --> 2242.70]  You're right.
[2242.80 --> 2243.32]  You're right.
[2243.32 --> 2244.04]  So we did.
[2244.58 --> 2246.22]  So we decided on 2005
[2246.22 --> 2248.06]  and we built a machine
[2248.06 --> 2249.66]  with a 4400 plus
[2249.66 --> 2250.74]  Athlon X2,
[2251.14 --> 2252.62]  OCZ Gold Memory,
[2253.16 --> 2256.16]  ASUS A8N SLI Premium.
[2256.40 --> 2257.22]  That's the model.
[2257.78 --> 2259.24]  Antec SLK 2600.
[2259.24 --> 2260.74]  We found a brand new
[2260.74 --> 2262.00]  SLK 2600.
[2262.76 --> 2263.68]  So it's basically
[2263.68 --> 2264.66]  the Antec Landboy
[2264.66 --> 2265.96]  but steel instead of aluminum.
[2266.50 --> 2267.08]  Brand new?
[2267.28 --> 2268.68]  It was brand new.
[2268.76 --> 2269.76]  Like the manual inside
[2269.76 --> 2271.04]  was yellowed with age
[2271.04 --> 2271.76]  but it was...
[2271.76 --> 2272.68]  Who stored that?
[2272.68 --> 2273.44]  It was sealed.
[2274.26 --> 2275.52]  Brand new in box.
[2276.54 --> 2276.82]  Cool.
[2277.18 --> 2277.38]  Yeah,
[2277.46 --> 2277.98]  some ancient
[2277.98 --> 2280.18]  Seasonic 520 watt power supply.
[2280.40 --> 2281.14]  It was awesome.
[2281.24 --> 2281.48]  It was fun.
[2281.56 --> 2281.82]  Anyway,
[2282.20 --> 2283.20]  one of the games we played
[2283.20 --> 2283.84]  as we were building
[2283.84 --> 2285.10]  the machine was,
[2285.24 --> 2285.36]  you know,
[2285.40 --> 2286.08]  how much do you think
[2286.08 --> 2286.90]  this thing cost
[2286.90 --> 2287.76]  back in 2005?
[2288.48 --> 2288.72]  Okay.
[2288.88 --> 2289.38]  I guessed
[2289.38 --> 2290.72]  so far over
[2290.72 --> 2291.74]  on the graphics card
[2291.74 --> 2293.14]  because I had forgotten
[2293.14 --> 2295.18]  that an 8800 GT
[2295.18 --> 2296.66]  was only like
[2296.66 --> 2298.44]  a couple hundred bucks.
[2298.64 --> 2299.96]  It was like $250.
[2299.96 --> 2302.08]  now $250
[2302.08 --> 2303.22]  buys you
[2303.22 --> 2303.86]  and remember
[2303.86 --> 2304.68]  that was Canadian.
[2305.22 --> 2305.70]  Canadian!
[2307.12 --> 2307.68]  $250
[2307.68 --> 2309.16]  buys you
[2309.16 --> 2310.98]  the entry-levelist
[2310.98 --> 2312.22]  GTX card now.
[2312.34 --> 2313.28]  That was one step
[2313.28 --> 2314.12]  under the top.
[2314.80 --> 2315.64]  I remember
[2315.64 --> 2316.96]  the concept.
[2317.34 --> 2317.90]  I remember
[2317.90 --> 2318.90]  like laying out
[2318.90 --> 2320.32]  there was this
[2320.32 --> 2321.06]  period of time
[2321.06 --> 2321.74]  where like a lot
[2321.74 --> 2322.20]  of my friends
[2322.20 --> 2323.14]  were getting computer upgrades
[2323.14 --> 2323.92]  and like a lot
[2323.92 --> 2324.72]  of people that I knew
[2324.72 --> 2325.84]  were actively building
[2325.84 --> 2326.18]  computers.
[2326.34 --> 2327.22]  It was very...
[2327.22 --> 2328.88]  it was pretty crazy.
[2329.02 --> 2329.56]  I think we were all
[2329.56 --> 2330.10]  like transitioning
[2330.10 --> 2330.64]  out of high school
[2330.64 --> 2331.52]  and getting real jobs
[2331.52 --> 2331.82]  and we're like,
[2331.90 --> 2332.40]  wait, money?
[2332.48 --> 2333.00]  I'm going to spend
[2333.00 --> 2333.68]  it all right away.
[2333.84 --> 2333.98]  Yeah.
[2334.40 --> 2335.02]  Good strat.
[2335.18 --> 2335.58]  Good strat.
[2335.96 --> 2336.74]  But like I remember
[2336.74 --> 2338.26]  300 bucks on a graphics
[2338.26 --> 2339.38]  card was like
[2339.38 --> 2340.96]  if you can afford
[2340.96 --> 2341.44]  what a gamer.
[2342.76 --> 2344.42]  Like you're a mad lad.
[2344.70 --> 2344.90]  Yeah.
[2345.00 --> 2346.18]  Like your machine's
[2346.18 --> 2347.14]  going to be insane.
[2347.26 --> 2348.12]  You're a gamer, boy.
[2348.68 --> 2349.44]  Oh my...
[2349.44 --> 2349.98]  You're going to run
[2349.98 --> 2351.28]  everything on like
[2351.28 --> 2352.50]  great settings.
[2352.50 --> 2353.38]  It's going to last you
[2353.38 --> 2354.80]  for at least three years
[2354.80 --> 2356.28]  at like fairly high performance.
[2356.28 --> 2357.06]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2358.28 --> 2359.98]  That's just so intensely
[2359.98 --> 2360.82]  not true now.
[2360.96 --> 2361.42]  Now...
[2361.42 --> 2362.74]  People don't make more money.
[2363.64 --> 2365.40]  Now $315
[2365.40 --> 2367.54]  is going to buy you...
[2367.54 --> 2368.20]  Oh, that's even...
[2368.20 --> 2369.28]  That's an auction too.
[2369.38 --> 2370.16]  That's not even...
[2370.16 --> 2370.86]  Oh my goodness.
[2371.38 --> 2371.54]  Okay.
[2371.56 --> 2372.52]  Let's find a 1080.
[2372.94 --> 2374.08]  Let's find a 1080.
[2374.74 --> 2375.54]  Oh, this auction.
[2375.98 --> 2376.90]  Where's a buy it now
[2376.90 --> 2377.62]  for a 1080?
[2377.82 --> 2378.34]  Come on.
[2379.30 --> 2379.70]  $315.
[2379.84 --> 2380.34]  Here you go.
[2380.86 --> 2382.56]  $315 is going to buy you
[2382.56 --> 2384.62]  a 1080 from...
[2384.62 --> 2384.88]  And the...
[2384.88 --> 2385.64]  Oh, remember too.
[2385.64 --> 2387.02]  The 1080 and the 1080 Ti
[2387.02 --> 2388.00]  did not launch
[2388.00 --> 2388.82]  at the same time.
[2389.28 --> 2391.14]  No, that's the 2016 card.
[2391.66 --> 2392.86]  Hold on a second.
[2394.40 --> 2398.18]  May 6th, 2016.
[2399.64 --> 2400.36]  Four...
[2400.36 --> 2402.08]  Over four years ago.
[2402.50 --> 2404.54]  Like, step down card.
[2404.64 --> 2405.30]  That's what you get
[2405.30 --> 2407.10]  for your $300 to $350.
[2407.58 --> 2408.84]  How much do we...
[2408.84 --> 2409.82]  Look, look.
[2409.92 --> 2410.54]  I know...
[2410.54 --> 2412.22]  I know Intel also takes
[2412.22 --> 2413.06]  a lot of flack
[2413.06 --> 2415.96]  for their anti-competitive behavior
[2415.96 --> 2417.34]  that they've, you know,
[2417.44 --> 2418.90]  engaged in over the years
[2418.90 --> 2420.58]  and all that, etc.
[2421.38 --> 2423.00]  How hard do we need Intel
[2423.00 --> 2423.80]  to come in and compete
[2423.80 --> 2424.68]  with NVIDIA here?
[2425.36 --> 2426.18]  So, so badly.
[2426.34 --> 2427.16]  So, so badly.
[2427.28 --> 2427.70]  So badly.
[2427.70 --> 2428.90]  I've been waiting for this.
[2429.14 --> 2430.38]  I've been excited for this.
[2430.66 --> 2432.34]  Is there any rumors about that?
[2432.54 --> 2434.02]  That's the type of, like,
[2434.38 --> 2435.30]  tech rumor that I want,
[2435.38 --> 2435.90]  is when are they
[2435.90 --> 2436.90]  stepping into the space?
[2436.90 --> 2438.22]  I've seen some really
[2438.22 --> 2440.40]  downer rumors about that.
[2440.50 --> 2442.04]  I've seen some that they're,
[2442.20 --> 2443.50]  that it's not going well
[2443.50 --> 2444.78]  and stuff like that.
[2445.16 --> 2445.26]  So...
[2445.26 --> 2445.52]  Yeah.
[2446.62 --> 2447.32]  I don't know.
[2447.42 --> 2448.02]  That's what I've really heard, too.
[2448.02 --> 2448.88]  It's all rumors.
[2449.18 --> 2450.10]  It's all rumors.
[2450.38 --> 2451.56]  Rajakadiri's still there.
[2451.80 --> 2452.54]  So, presumably,
[2452.70 --> 2453.90]  they're still working on something.
[2454.00 --> 2455.52]  I just hope it's not another, like,
[2456.08 --> 2457.56]  yeah, it's a data center thing
[2457.56 --> 2459.54]  and you could game on it, I guess,
[2459.58 --> 2460.98]  if you really wanted to.
[2462.34 --> 2463.36]  I hope it's,
[2463.42 --> 2464.66]  I hope within a couple years
[2464.66 --> 2465.82]  they actually have a real
[2465.82 --> 2466.88]  gaming graphics card.
[2467.26 --> 2469.38]  You know, I hope RDNA 2 is amazing.
[2469.68 --> 2470.06]  That, too.
[2470.14 --> 2471.72]  I hope Dr. Sue manages to,
[2472.16 --> 2473.94]  now that she's come in
[2473.94 --> 2475.84]  and fixed the CPU side
[2475.84 --> 2477.16]  of the business,
[2477.32 --> 2478.52]  I hope she takes a little,
[2478.52 --> 2481.06]  little train ride down to GPU town
[2481.06 --> 2483.60]  and kicks their caboose a little bit
[2483.60 --> 2485.24]  and gets that team going here
[2485.24 --> 2486.48]  because it's been so long
[2486.48 --> 2487.58]  since AMD has even been
[2487.58 --> 2488.60]  in the conversation
[2488.60 --> 2490.32]  for a high-end graphics card.
[2491.14 --> 2492.12]  Like, even that one
[2492.12 --> 2493.36]  that they did release a little while,
[2493.36 --> 2493.86]  I don't even remember
[2493.86 --> 2494.46]  what it's called.
[2494.66 --> 2495.42]  What was that?
[2495.44 --> 2496.54]  What was that stupid card
[2496.54 --> 2497.36]  that was available
[2497.36 --> 2498.58]  for, like, a few months
[2498.58 --> 2499.58]  while they burned through
[2499.58 --> 2501.82]  some presumably excess inventory
[2501.82 --> 2502.98]  of data center GPUs
[2502.98 --> 2503.30]  or something
[2503.30 --> 2503.94]  and then it just, like,
[2503.96 --> 2504.66]  kind of went away.
[2505.44 --> 2507.32]  What was that card even called?
[2508.28 --> 2509.94]  I don't remember.
[2510.46 --> 2510.66]  Not, not,
[2511.02 --> 2512.00]  it was After Fury.
[2513.46 --> 2514.94]  Uh, man,
[2515.16 --> 2516.04]  I don't even remember.
[2516.82 --> 2517.56]  Chat, come on,
[2517.60 --> 2518.58]  help me out here, guys.
[2520.04 --> 2520.70]  Help me out.
[2520.74 --> 2521.20]  What was that?
[2521.24 --> 2521.70]  What was that thing?
[2521.70 --> 2523.68]  We, like, covered it at CES and stuff
[2523.68 --> 2524.26]  and I was like,
[2524.30 --> 2524.90]  oh, yay,
[2525.00 --> 2526.74]  this is real competition.
[2527.06 --> 2528.24]  No, not the 5700.
[2528.52 --> 2529.64]  That's, like, mid-tier stuff.
[2529.74 --> 2530.96]  What was the high-end one?
[2531.88 --> 2533.32]  Nobody wrote Radeon 7.
[2533.96 --> 2534.72]  Radeon 7,
[2534.80 --> 2535.42]  that was the one.
[2535.62 --> 2537.30]  Can you even buy a Radeon 7?
[2537.30 --> 2542.00]  Uh, while you figure that out,
[2542.08 --> 2543.12]  by the way,
[2543.40 --> 2543.90]  uh,
[2544.12 --> 2545.42]  Jayden reminded me
[2545.42 --> 2545.76]  to,
[2545.82 --> 2546.64]  to bring this up.
[2546.92 --> 2547.36]  Uh,
[2547.36 --> 2548.50]  while we were struggling
[2548.50 --> 2548.96]  with,
[2549.06 --> 2549.76]  with Apple,
[2549.96 --> 2550.38]  uh,
[2550.40 --> 2550.64]  to,
[2550.72 --> 2551.42]  to do some things
[2551.42 --> 2552.12]  that didn't make him
[2552.12 --> 2553.20]  want to pull all of his hair
[2553.20 --> 2553.66]  out at once,
[2554.04 --> 2554.62]  uh,
[2554.80 --> 2555.80]  Jayden started work
[2555.80 --> 2557.86]  on the much-requested
[2557.86 --> 2558.64]  dark mode.
[2559.02 --> 2559.34]  Uh,
[2559.34 --> 2560.26]  if you are interested
[2560.26 --> 2561.32]  in trying it,
[2561.32 --> 2563.38]  it is on the beta,
[2563.72 --> 2564.72]  uh,
[2564.72 --> 2565.56]  the beta track
[2565.56 --> 2568.30]  on the Android Play Store.
[2568.80 --> 2569.32]  Sweet.
[2569.76 --> 2570.28]  Obviously,
[2570.32 --> 2571.20]  we've been having issues
[2571.20 --> 2572.04]  on the Apple side,
[2572.10 --> 2573.30]  so there's nothing there.
[2573.48 --> 2573.92]  Uh,
[2573.92 --> 2574.84]  but on the Android Play Store,
[2574.90 --> 2575.38]  if you want,
[2575.46 --> 2576.58]  you can opt for the beta.
[2576.84 --> 2577.28]  Uh,
[2577.32 --> 2579.22]  it is a test version.
[2579.30 --> 2580.36]  It is a prototype version.
[2580.62 --> 2581.80]  Some things are not
[2581.80 --> 2582.76]  color-shifted yet.
[2583.06 --> 2583.82]  The colors are still
[2583.82 --> 2584.70]  being tweaked
[2584.70 --> 2585.48]  stylistically.
[2585.76 --> 2587.42]  It's not the final version.
[2587.76 --> 2588.00]  All right.
[2588.00 --> 2589.54]  That's why it's called a beta.
[2589.88 --> 2590.14]  Uh,
[2590.14 --> 2590.98]  but if you want to check it out,
[2591.16 --> 2591.74]  you can check it out.
[2591.80 --> 2592.32]  Go check it out.
[2592.70 --> 2593.10]  Uh,
[2593.16 --> 2593.50]  so,
[2593.50 --> 2594.12]  hold on.
[2594.18 --> 2595.26]  Over on Flowplane,
[2595.58 --> 2596.28]  uh,
[2596.54 --> 2597.12]  hold on.
[2597.22 --> 2597.84]  Where'd that chat?
[2597.96 --> 2598.16]  Where'd that?
[2598.44 --> 2599.32]  Conan Kudo says,
[2599.38 --> 2601.08]  Radeon 7 is available on sale.
[2601.48 --> 2601.70]  Well,
[2601.78 --> 2602.84]  it sure isn't on Newegg,
[2603.32 --> 2604.70]  and as far as I'm concerned,
[2604.78 --> 2605.92]  if it's not on Newegg,
[2606.00 --> 2607.38]  it doesn't exist.
[2607.48 --> 2607.64]  Like,
[2607.70 --> 2608.50]  there might be a handful
[2608.50 --> 2609.24]  of them out there
[2609.24 --> 2609.70]  or something,
[2609.88 --> 2610.08]  but,
[2610.98 --> 2611.50]  yeah,
[2611.56 --> 2612.48]  if it's not here,
[2612.64 --> 2613.62]  it's not real.
[2613.96 --> 2615.88]  5,700 XT is the cream
[2615.88 --> 2616.20]  of the crop.
[2616.28 --> 2616.44]  Wow,
[2616.48 --> 2617.14]  why does this only have
[2617.14 --> 2617.82]  three eggs?
[2619.00 --> 2619.58]  What's,
[2619.68 --> 2620.14]  what could be,
[2620.18 --> 2621.00]  how could Asrock
[2621.00 --> 2622.08]  screw this up that badly?
[2622.16 --> 2622.24]  Oh,
[2622.26 --> 2622.74]  it must have just been
[2622.74 --> 2623.66]  early ones or something.
[2624.06 --> 2625.42]  Does Best Buy have them?
[2626.00 --> 2626.32]  Oh,
[2626.42 --> 2627.06]  come on.
[2627.90 --> 2629.00]  I think Best,
[2629.06 --> 2630.44]  Best Buy Radeon 7,
[2630.60 --> 2631.36]  $550.
[2633.80 --> 2634.76]  Maybe those are just,
[2634.90 --> 2635.44]  sold out.
[2635.56 --> 2636.46]  I think it's an old listing.
[2636.62 --> 2636.94]  Okay,
[2637.04 --> 2637.56]  I was going to say,
[2637.62 --> 2638.30]  maybe those are just
[2638.30 --> 2639.32]  still on the shelf.
[2641.20 --> 2641.60]  Because,
[2641.72 --> 2641.80]  like,
[2641.82 --> 2643.04]  I remember back in the day,
[2643.10 --> 2643.82]  you would find
[2643.82 --> 2645.20]  really old stuff
[2645.20 --> 2646.70]  listed on Best Buy sometimes.
[2646.82 --> 2647.56]  Get that retro,
[2647.56 --> 2648.82]  get that retro tech,
[2649.30 --> 2649.54]  you know,
[2649.66 --> 2651.06]  to yesterday's tech,
[2651.20 --> 2652.00]  tomorrow's price,
[2652.14 --> 2652.96]  kind of thing.
[2653.34 --> 2653.78]  Apparently,
[2653.78 --> 2655.22]  they're doing a lot better
[2655.22 --> 2656.20]  in terms of online
[2656.20 --> 2657.44]  computer hardware sales
[2657.44 --> 2658.02]  these days,
[2658.08 --> 2658.26]  though.
[2658.80 --> 2660.08]  I was talking to
[2660.08 --> 2660.98]  a buddy of mine
[2660.98 --> 2662.34]  who works for Corsair,
[2662.34 --> 2664.00]  and he was like,
[2664.06 --> 2664.30]  yeah,
[2664.50 --> 2665.72]  those Best Buy guys,
[2665.90 --> 2666.06]  like,
[2666.28 --> 2667.48]  don't take my word for it,
[2667.56 --> 2668.48]  go do your own digging,
[2668.66 --> 2668.88]  because,
[2669.08 --> 2669.28]  you know,
[2669.36 --> 2669.66]  whatever.
[2670.14 --> 2670.54]  But,
[2670.62 --> 2671.78]  they have been
[2671.78 --> 2673.14]  stepping up their game.
[2673.20 --> 2673.54]  And actually,
[2673.62 --> 2674.38]  if you go and look
[2674.38 --> 2675.20]  at computer components
[2675.20 --> 2675.72]  on the site,
[2675.78 --> 2676.88]  there's way more variety
[2676.88 --> 2678.24]  and there's,
[2678.30 --> 2678.36]  like,
[2678.38 --> 2679.14]  a ton of reviews
[2679.14 --> 2679.70]  for stuff.
[2679.92 --> 2680.30]  Like,
[2680.40 --> 2680.92]  the Asus
[2680.92 --> 2682.14]  Tough Gaming
[2682.14 --> 2683.12]  X570 Plus,
[2683.22 --> 2683.44]  remember,
[2683.54 --> 2684.24]  that's a relatively
[2684.24 --> 2684.94]  new board,
[2685.06 --> 2685.76]  that's a new platform,
[2686.08 --> 2688.12]  has 335 customer reviews
[2688.12 --> 2689.00]  on Best Buy.
[2689.50 --> 2690.32]  They must be moving
[2690.32 --> 2692.72]  a freaking ton
[2692.72 --> 2694.08]  of computer components.
[2694.56 --> 2696.36]  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX
[2696.36 --> 2697.44]  2070 Super,
[2697.62 --> 2698.74]  I believe this is
[2698.74 --> 2700.06]  the,
[2700.06 --> 2700.58]  like,
[2700.72 --> 2701.24]  standard one,
[2701.38 --> 2703.14]  has 449 reviews.
[2703.48 --> 2704.68]  That Radeon 7
[2704.68 --> 2706.68]  even had 22 reviews.
[2706.68 --> 2707.08]  Yeah,
[2707.08 --> 2707.38]  I know,
[2707.46 --> 2707.62]  right?
[2708.42 --> 2708.74]  Yeah.
[2709.12 --> 2709.20]  I,
[2710.12 --> 2711.04]  differentiation
[2711.04 --> 2712.12]  in the
[2712.12 --> 2713.44]  online sales space
[2713.44 --> 2714.86]  is very good.
[2715.58 --> 2715.86]  Mr.
[2716.24 --> 2717.70]  could purchase,
[2717.80 --> 2717.98]  like,
[2718.02 --> 2718.68]  half the planet,
[2718.88 --> 2719.16]  Bezos.
[2719.84 --> 2720.30]  So,
[2720.40 --> 2720.54]  yeah,
[2720.60 --> 2721.28]  I'm happy that,
[2721.44 --> 2722.32]  I'm happy Best Buy's
[2722.32 --> 2722.70]  doing well.
[2722.74 --> 2722.92]  Yeah,
[2722.96 --> 2723.36]  honestly,
[2723.44 --> 2724.24]  I'm happy Best Buy's
[2724.24 --> 2725.08]  getting their crap together,
[2725.20 --> 2725.30]  too.
[2725.38 --> 2726.14]  It's a good thing.
[2726.92 --> 2727.56]  All right,
[2727.68 --> 2728.32]  why don't we jump
[2728.32 --> 2730.30]  into our sponsors here?
[2732.80 --> 2733.46]  First up,
[2733.56 --> 2733.94]  we got
[2733.94 --> 2735.60]  private internet access.
[2736.70 --> 2737.40]  What's in your
[2737.40 --> 2738.70]  online security toolkit?
[2739.20 --> 2739.98]  Adding a VPN...
[2739.98 --> 2740.40]  Private internet access?
[2740.76 --> 2740.96]  Yeah,
[2740.98 --> 2741.28]  me too.
[2741.62 --> 2742.30]  Adding a VPN
[2742.30 --> 2743.56]  lets you mask your IP
[2743.56 --> 2744.46]  and encrypt traffic
[2744.46 --> 2745.48]  to and from your devices.
[2746.00 --> 2747.56]  And PIA has reliable service
[2747.56 --> 2749.08]  with thousands of servers
[2749.08 --> 2750.22]  in dozens of countries

[2762.40 --> 2762.64]  iOS,
[2762.88 --> 2763.90]  and Linux.
[2764.02 --> 2764.16]  So,
[2764.24 --> 2764.60]  why wait?
[2764.88 --> 2765.38]  Check it out at
[2765.38 --> 2766.26]  lmg.gg
[2766.26 --> 2767.76]  slash PIA.
[2768.30 --> 2768.74]  Finally,
[2768.86 --> 2769.60]  the show is brought to you
[2769.60 --> 2770.36]  by Displate.
[2770.64 --> 2771.60]  Displate is...
[2771.60 --> 2772.00]  It's simple.
[2772.10 --> 2772.84]  It's a magnetic
[2772.84 --> 2774.68]  mounted metal print
[2774.68 --> 2776.14]  and it sticks on your wall
[2776.14 --> 2777.10]  and looks awesome.
[2777.18 --> 2777.88]  They've got over...
[2777.88 --> 2778.38]  They've got like...
[2778.38 --> 2778.96]  They're getting close
[2778.96 --> 2780.60]  to a million different arts,
[2781.16 --> 2781.84]  like spanning
[2781.84 --> 2783.50]  every conceivable style.
[2783.90 --> 2784.40]  They're durable.
[2784.58 --> 2784.90]  You don't need
[2784.90 --> 2785.78]  any power tools
[2785.78 --> 2786.32]  to hang them
[2786.32 --> 2787.84]  and there's no holes
[2787.84 --> 2788.28]  in your wall
[2788.28 --> 2788.82]  thanks to their
[2788.82 --> 2789.52]  magnetic mounting.
[2789.78 --> 2790.44]  They plant a tree
[2790.44 --> 2791.68]  for every Displate purchased
[2791.68 --> 2792.70]  and we even have
[2792.70 --> 2794.04]  our own line of Displates
[2794.04 --> 2795.52]  at displate.com
[2795.52 --> 2796.96]  slash Linus Tech Tips.
[2797.46 --> 2797.68]  So,
[2797.80 --> 2798.24]  why wait?
[2798.54 --> 2799.66]  Save 15%
[2799.66 --> 2800.50]  on a Displate
[2800.50 --> 2801.90]  at lmg.gg
[2801.90 --> 2803.50]  slash Displate
[2803.50 --> 2804.90]  when...
[2804.90 --> 2805.12]  Here,
[2805.18 --> 2806.08]  I'm just going to take a moment
[2806.08 --> 2807.50]  to show you guys
[2807.50 --> 2808.26]  our designs.
[2808.42 --> 2808.60]  Oh,
[2808.64 --> 2809.68]  we've got more!
[2810.38 --> 2810.82]  Oh,
[2810.96 --> 2811.36]  cool!
[2811.88 --> 2812.28]  Oh,
[2812.42 --> 2813.32]  this is really cool.
[2813.44 --> 2813.64]  Okay,
[2813.70 --> 2814.56]  hold on a second here.
[2815.44 --> 2815.88]  So,
[2816.10 --> 2816.78]  we've got
[2816.78 --> 2818.80]  designs from the shirts,
[2819.38 --> 2820.38]  which I think
[2820.38 --> 2821.20]  are awesome.
[2821.98 --> 2822.52]  Check that out.
[2822.58 --> 2822.76]  Apparently,
[2822.82 --> 2823.22]  we've got some
[2823.22 --> 2824.22]  of our old posters
[2824.22 --> 2824.92]  and stuff too.
[2825.04 --> 2825.90]  Linus Tech Tips poster,
[2826.02 --> 2826.76]  TechWiki poster.
[2827.78 --> 2828.14]  Oh,
[2828.22 --> 2828.42]  man,
[2828.48 --> 2829.22]  that Ram one
[2829.22 --> 2830.64]  looks really good
[2830.64 --> 2831.34]  as a Displate.
[2831.86 --> 2832.52]  It really does,
[2832.58 --> 2832.86]  actually.
[2833.36 --> 2833.72]  Honestly,
[2833.92 --> 2835.20]  bringing the shirts
[2835.20 --> 2836.54]  onto Displates
[2836.54 --> 2837.06]  was...
[2837.06 --> 2838.00]  That makes a lot of sense
[2838.00 --> 2838.88]  because those designs
[2838.88 --> 2839.72]  are very universal.
[2839.96 --> 2840.56]  They don't have to be
[2840.56 --> 2840.96]  on a shirt.
[2841.10 --> 2841.84]  And check this out.
[2841.92 --> 2842.22]  Actually,
[2842.30 --> 2843.08]  this is one that
[2843.08 --> 2843.86]  I was not aware
[2843.86 --> 2844.50]  that we had put on.
[2844.96 --> 2845.60]  What's that?
[2846.14 --> 2846.78]  What the heck?
[2846.90 --> 2847.42]  What's the...
[2847.42 --> 2848.26]  Why are there...
[2848.26 --> 2849.78]  What are these landscapes?
[2850.12 --> 2850.84]  Why do we have
[2850.84 --> 2851.80]  landscapes here?
[2852.34 --> 2852.84]  Guess where
[2852.84 --> 2853.42]  these are from?
[2854.60 --> 2856.32]  I don't see
[2856.32 --> 2857.90]  the updated stream yet,
[2857.98 --> 2858.56]  so I can't.
[2858.56 --> 2858.86]  Oh,
[2858.86 --> 2859.26]  okay.
[2859.82 --> 2860.24]  Well,
[2860.28 --> 2860.96]  they're beautiful.
[2862.14 --> 2863.36]  Why don't I say
[2863.36 --> 2863.84]  that much?
[2863.94 --> 2864.70]  They're absolutely
[2864.70 --> 2865.22]  beautiful.
[2867.14 --> 2868.16]  Can you guess
[2868.16 --> 2868.72]  where we would get...
[2868.72 --> 2869.88]  Is that Brandon?
[2870.10 --> 2870.44]  Yeah!
[2870.44 --> 2872.32]  So these are
[2872.32 --> 2873.50]  some of Brandon's
[2873.50 --> 2874.02]  photography.
[2874.50 --> 2875.22]  So you guys
[2875.22 --> 2876.12]  can check it out.
[2877.60 --> 2878.74]  That's super cool.
[2878.94 --> 2879.14]  Yeah,
[2879.18 --> 2879.78]  I recognize
[2879.78 --> 2880.74]  at least some of these
[2880.74 --> 2881.34]  from our work
[2881.34 --> 2882.32]  Cation to Banff.
[2882.78 --> 2883.30]  So...
[2883.30 --> 2884.28]  That's...
[2884.28 --> 2885.44]  I mean...
[2885.44 --> 2886.64]  No offense
[2886.64 --> 2887.48]  to the more
[2887.48 --> 2888.34]  branded stuff,
[2888.44 --> 2889.38]  but that's probably
[2889.38 --> 2890.16]  the ones
[2890.16 --> 2890.82]  that I would...
[2890.82 --> 2892.08]  I would go for.
[2892.18 --> 2893.50]  Those are amazing photos.
[2893.72 --> 2894.42]  Not to like
[2894.42 --> 2895.16]  to brand it's word,
[2895.26 --> 2896.44]  but those are...
[2896.44 --> 2898.26]  As far as my
[2898.26 --> 2899.44]  untrained eye can tell,
[2899.50 --> 2899.92]  those are like
[2899.92 --> 2900.90]  world-class photos.
[2900.96 --> 2901.08]  Well,
[2901.12 --> 2902.98]  that's the low-key
[2902.98 --> 2904.28]  fan move,
[2904.32 --> 2904.54]  right?
[2905.12 --> 2905.66]  You get the...
[2905.66 --> 2905.92]  That too.
[2906.30 --> 2906.56]  Yeah.
[2907.16 --> 2907.88]  You don't need
[2907.88 --> 2908.56]  the Linus Tech Tips
[2908.56 --> 2909.46]  logo on your wall
[2909.46 --> 2910.08]  necessarily.
[2910.42 --> 2911.18]  Maybe that's not
[2911.18 --> 2911.84]  your style.
[2912.34 --> 2913.26]  Like you might live
[2913.26 --> 2914.26]  with a relationship
[2914.26 --> 2915.34]  partner that is not
[2915.34 --> 2916.44]  necessarily as
[2916.44 --> 2918.12]  into Linus Tech Tips
[2918.12 --> 2918.70]  as you are,
[2918.90 --> 2919.74]  but you could go
[2919.74 --> 2920.36]  this route.
[2920.86 --> 2921.54]  They look
[2921.54 --> 2922.88]  stunning.
[2923.30 --> 2924.04]  They don't put
[2924.04 --> 2924.80]  holes in walls
[2924.80 --> 2925.96]  and they're not
[2925.96 --> 2927.10]  pushing like a
[2927.10 --> 2928.10]  specific brand
[2928.10 --> 2928.64]  so they might be
[2928.64 --> 2929.24]  more accepting.
[2930.06 --> 2930.68]  It's cool.
[2930.86 --> 2931.34]  Heck yeah.
[2931.84 --> 2933.08]  So go check it out.
[2933.74 --> 2934.30]  All right.
[2934.32 --> 2934.72]  What do we want
[2934.72 --> 2935.52]  to jump into next?
[2935.62 --> 2936.06]  Man, we've only
[2936.06 --> 2936.48]  made it through
[2936.48 --> 2937.26]  like two topics.
[2937.76 --> 2938.48]  We got to do
[2938.48 --> 2939.42]  the Corsair IPO.
[2939.98 --> 2940.46]  We got to do
[2940.46 --> 2941.32]  the Corsair IPO.
[2941.66 --> 2942.90]  So The Verge
[2942.90 --> 2943.88]  reported on this.
[2944.72 --> 2946.10]  So hopefully you guys
[2946.10 --> 2946.88]  have a Phillips
[2946.88 --> 2947.62]  head screwdriver
[2947.62 --> 2949.44]  so you can make
[2949.44 --> 2949.86]  your way through
[2949.86 --> 2950.84]  this article here.
[2951.48 --> 2952.30]  You know, fun...
[2952.30 --> 2952.88]  Okay, sorry.
[2953.40 --> 2953.72]  Sorry.
[2953.94 --> 2954.32]  What was it?
[2954.50 --> 2955.40]  I'm going off topic.
[2955.40 --> 2956.12]  Livestrong
[2956.12 --> 2957.44]  anti-static strap.
[2957.58 --> 2957.70]  Yes.
[2957.88 --> 2959.26]  So, okay.
[2959.72 --> 2960.56]  I...
[2960.56 --> 2961.74]  It showed up
[2961.74 --> 2962.52]  in my recommended
[2962.52 --> 2963.66]  the other day
[2963.66 --> 2964.62]  and I have a
[2964.62 --> 2966.18]  confession for you.
[2966.66 --> 2967.76]  I had never
[2967.76 --> 2969.16]  actually watched
[2969.16 --> 2970.52]  the full build
[2970.52 --> 2971.16]  guide.
[2971.62 --> 2971.72]  Yeah.
[2971.78 --> 2972.78]  It's...
[2972.78 --> 2973.24]  Yeah.
[2973.48 --> 2974.48]  I assumed...
[2974.48 --> 2975.30]  I assumed
[2975.30 --> 2975.82]  at the time...
[2975.82 --> 2976.46]  I had watched
[2976.46 --> 2977.94]  Kyle's reaction
[2977.94 --> 2978.50]  to it
[2978.50 --> 2980.62]  but not the
[2980.62 --> 2981.20]  entire thing.
[2981.26 --> 2981.72]  I think I watched
[2981.72 --> 2982.38]  like half of it
[2982.38 --> 2982.90]  because that was
[2982.90 --> 2983.80]  a very busy time
[2983.80 --> 2984.28]  of my life.
[2984.40 --> 2985.14]  Nothing Against Kyle.
[2985.22 --> 2985.78]  It's a great video.
[2985.90 --> 2986.62]  I've actually since
[2986.62 --> 2987.48]  watched the whole thing
[2987.48 --> 2987.76]  through.
[2988.52 --> 2989.66]  But at the time
[2989.66 --> 2990.58]  the reason
[2990.58 --> 2991.72]  that I didn't do
[2991.72 --> 2993.20]  like a Linus Reacts 2
[2993.20 --> 2994.26]  video was because
[2994.26 --> 2996.64]  I just was too busy
[2996.64 --> 2998.36]  to like go watch it
[2998.36 --> 2999.70]  thinking that
[2999.70 --> 3000.94]  it couldn't be that bad
[3000.94 --> 3001.60]  and there probably
[3001.60 --> 3002.24]  wasn't going to be
[3002.24 --> 3002.90]  a video in there
[3002.90 --> 3004.48]  anyway so I'm not
[3004.48 --> 3005.00]  going to bother.
[3005.58 --> 3007.10]  It really is
[3007.10 --> 3008.26]  that bad.
[3008.58 --> 3009.70]  The worst part
[3009.70 --> 3010.52]  though...
[3010.52 --> 3011.16]  And there's a lot
[3011.16 --> 3012.30]  of people that are...
[3012.30 --> 3013.20]  There's a lot of people
[3013.20 --> 3014.36]  still harassing
[3014.36 --> 3015.48]  the guy that made it
[3015.48 --> 3016.80]  which is honestly
[3016.80 --> 3018.62]  the joke's over
[3018.62 --> 3019.38]  at this point.
[3020.62 --> 3023.30]  But there's also
[3023.30 --> 3024.74]  how terribly
[3024.74 --> 3025.60]  it was handled.
[3026.14 --> 3027.58]  Like he still
[3027.58 --> 3028.42]  hasn't acknowledged
[3028.42 --> 3029.00]  that he did
[3029.00 --> 3029.70]  anything wrong
[3029.70 --> 3031.00]  and it's like
[3031.00 --> 3032.50]  really?
[3033.30 --> 3034.18]  Like I suspect
[3034.18 --> 3034.66]  that would...
[3034.66 --> 3035.46]  He got very defensive
[3035.46 --> 3036.14]  over the whole thing.
[3036.16 --> 3036.66]  You should still
[3036.66 --> 3037.34]  leave him alone
[3037.34 --> 3039.08]  because like
[3039.08 --> 3040.18]  there's no real
[3040.18 --> 3041.14]  good reason to
[3041.14 --> 3042.56]  especially continue
[3042.56 --> 3043.74]  harassment on anybody
[3043.74 --> 3044.74]  especially these days
[3044.74 --> 3045.38]  but
[3045.38 --> 3048.34]  it...
[3048.34 --> 3049.24]  Yeah.
[3049.36 --> 3050.14]  His response to it
[3050.14 --> 3050.66]  was not great.
[3050.92 --> 3051.92]  I remember like
[3051.92 --> 3053.12]  watching a stream
[3053.12 --> 3054.56]  that he was...
[3054.56 --> 3054.98]  I think he was
[3054.98 --> 3056.26]  playing some game.
[3056.62 --> 3057.26]  I don't remember
[3057.26 --> 3057.66]  what it was
[3057.66 --> 3059.12]  and he was talking
[3059.12 --> 3059.58]  about it
[3059.58 --> 3060.90]  and he mentioned
[3060.90 --> 3062.04]  like well it turned on
[3062.04 --> 3062.52]  and I'm like
[3062.52 --> 3063.34]  oh...
[3064.34 --> 3064.94]  It turned on
[3064.94 --> 3065.38]  because you made
[3065.38 --> 3066.26]  a lot of changes
[3066.26 --> 3068.10]  from the actual
[3068.10 --> 3069.32]  build guide portion.
[3070.28 --> 3071.06]  And like you can
[3071.06 --> 3073.00]  turn a computer on
[3073.00 --> 3074.24]  in a lot of
[3074.24 --> 3075.38]  not very good states.
[3075.48 --> 3076.10]  I've done it.
[3076.84 --> 3077.78]  I've turned a computer
[3077.78 --> 3078.58]  on with...
[3078.58 --> 3079.22]  Linus showed me
[3079.22 --> 3079.58]  this one
[3079.58 --> 3080.64]  with my palm
[3080.64 --> 3081.40]  pressed against
[3081.40 --> 3082.08]  the CPU
[3082.08 --> 3083.86]  to heatsink it
[3083.86 --> 3084.36]  temporarily
[3084.36 --> 3085.08]  while I check
[3085.08 --> 3085.52]  something.
[3085.92 --> 3086.60]  There's really...
[3086.60 --> 3087.40]  Like getting it
[3087.40 --> 3088.36]  to turn on
[3088.36 --> 3089.52]  is not like...
[3089.52 --> 3089.98]  Yeah.
[3090.30 --> 3090.96]  Not a super
[3090.96 --> 3092.18]  impressive feat.
[3092.96 --> 3094.46]  It's very basic
[3094.46 --> 3094.88]  Lego.
[3095.38 --> 3095.56]  Yeah.
[3096.30 --> 3097.30]  But like the thing
[3097.30 --> 3098.02]  is like all
[3098.02 --> 3099.12]  you have to do
[3099.12 --> 3100.08]  to make a scandal
[3100.08 --> 3101.20]  like that go away
[3101.20 --> 3103.34]  is say,
[3103.54 --> 3103.72]  you know,
[3103.80 --> 3104.76]  hey, my bad.
[3105.32 --> 3106.14]  Let me fix it.
[3106.52 --> 3107.24]  That's all you
[3107.24 --> 3108.02]  have to say.
[3108.92 --> 3109.54]  But some people
[3109.54 --> 3110.30]  can't do it.
[3110.92 --> 3111.48]  He could have...
[3111.48 --> 3112.16]  I...
[3112.16 --> 3113.16]  I...
[3113.16 --> 3114.26]  Because Kyle's
[3114.26 --> 3115.26]  a very stand-up guy.
[3115.36 --> 3116.44]  I like Kyle a lot.
[3116.68 --> 3118.38]  I almost guarantee
[3118.38 --> 3119.28]  you if he reached
[3119.28 --> 3119.96]  out to Kyle,
[3120.68 --> 3121.66]  they could have done
[3121.66 --> 3122.70]  like a really
[3122.70 --> 3124.42]  cool collab.
[3124.42 --> 3125.56]  Not even almost.
[3126.16 --> 3127.26]  I will put my
[3127.26 --> 3128.40]  personal Linus
[3128.40 --> 3129.88]  Sebastian seal
[3129.88 --> 3130.48]  of guarantee
[3130.48 --> 3131.06]  on that.
[3131.34 --> 3132.76]  There is no way
[3132.76 --> 3134.06]  that anyone
[3134.06 --> 3135.04]  I know in the
[3135.04 --> 3136.40]  PC tech space
[3136.40 --> 3136.92]  on YouTube
[3136.92 --> 3137.92]  wouldn't have
[3137.92 --> 3139.20]  absolutely helped
[3139.20 --> 3140.02]  them out to do it
[3140.02 --> 3140.88]  for on a do-over.
[3141.34 --> 3142.06]  Just, you know what?
[3142.44 --> 3143.04]  Why don't we just
[3143.04 --> 3143.88]  call that a mulligan?
[3144.56 --> 3145.16]  I don't even need
[3145.16 --> 3146.02]  your Capital One
[3146.02 --> 3146.94]  or Capital Direct
[3146.94 --> 3148.16]  or whoever sponsored it.
[3148.16 --> 3148.70]  I don't even need
[3148.70 --> 3149.76]  a chunk of your sponsorship.
[3149.98 --> 3150.72]  Let me just come in
[3150.72 --> 3151.88]  here and let's
[3151.88 --> 3152.70]  get this fixed.
[3153.54 --> 3154.34]  I reached out.
[3154.40 --> 3154.82]  I offered.
[3155.58 --> 3156.08]  Like, even though
[3156.08 --> 3156.46]  I hadn't even
[3156.46 --> 3157.24]  watched the video.
[3157.74 --> 3158.22]  Maybe that was
[3158.22 --> 3159.66]  part of why I offered.
[3159.76 --> 3160.06]  I don't know.
[3160.10 --> 3160.54]  I don't know what
[3160.54 --> 3161.08]  was in my head
[3161.08 --> 3161.48]  at the time,
[3161.52 --> 3162.14]  but I was just like,
[3162.18 --> 3162.60]  oh, yeah, sure.
[3162.66 --> 3162.92]  I don't know.
[3162.96 --> 3163.16]  Whatever.
[3163.58 --> 3164.50]  Like, I thought,
[3164.58 --> 3165.46]  like, can't be that bad,
[3165.52 --> 3166.50]  but, like, if he needs
[3166.50 --> 3167.20]  help, if he needs
[3167.20 --> 3167.96]  some pointers or whatever,
[3168.10 --> 3169.08]  hey, I got tech tips.
[3170.30 --> 3170.84]  Yeah, like,
[3170.96 --> 3172.22]  and they could have
[3172.22 --> 3172.76]  honestly
[3172.76 --> 3174.98]  completely removed
[3174.98 --> 3175.98]  the bad press
[3175.98 --> 3177.50]  and gotten
[3177.50 --> 3178.38]  that Capital One
[3178.38 --> 3178.82]  sponsorship
[3178.82 --> 3180.12]  a lot more traction
[3180.12 --> 3181.42]  than it originally had
[3181.42 --> 3182.44]  because I guarantee
[3182.44 --> 3183.96]  that follow-up video
[3183.96 --> 3185.24]  where they're just,
[3185.52 --> 3186.86]  they have humility
[3186.86 --> 3188.36]  and they laugh it off
[3188.36 --> 3189.52]  and they move forward
[3189.52 --> 3189.94]  and they make
[3189.94 --> 3190.88]  a great video out of it,
[3190.96 --> 3192.02]  that would have been
[3192.02 --> 3193.20]  huge.
[3193.36 --> 3193.74]  Oh, yeah.
[3193.88 --> 3194.34]  For sure.
[3194.46 --> 3194.96]  For sure.
[3195.62 --> 3195.90]  Massive.
[3196.00 --> 3196.30]  Absolutely.
[3197.34 --> 3197.96]  All right.
[3198.04 --> 3198.68]  Why don't we,
[3198.72 --> 3199.66]  why don't we move on
[3199.66 --> 3200.94]  to the next topic here?
[3201.20 --> 3202.82]  So, Corsair wants you
[3202.82 --> 3204.84]  to buy them.
[3205.98 --> 3206.84]  All right.
[3206.96 --> 3208.28]  So, the original article here
[3208.28 --> 3209.58]  is from The Verge
[3209.58 --> 3210.70]  and I have actually
[3210.70 --> 3212.26]  read through a fair amount
[3212.26 --> 3214.86]  of the Form S1 filing
[3214.86 --> 3215.56]  as well
[3215.56 --> 3217.02]  because I was
[3217.02 --> 3219.34]  really, really curious
[3219.34 --> 3220.78]  about this.
[3221.76 --> 3223.50]  It's long.
[3223.78 --> 3224.52]  Like, to be clear,
[3224.66 --> 3225.92]  I have not read this
[3225.92 --> 3226.74]  cover to cover.
[3227.16 --> 3229.42]  It is many, many, many pages
[3229.42 --> 3230.46]  of, you know,
[3230.54 --> 3231.68]  everything that's
[3231.68 --> 3233.30]  good about Corsair
[3233.30 --> 3234.38]  and the structure
[3234.38 --> 3235.72]  of Corsair
[3235.72 --> 3237.28]  and the balance sheets
[3237.28 --> 3238.32]  of Corsair
[3238.32 --> 3238.88]  and the,
[3239.16 --> 3240.00]  one of the things
[3240.00 --> 3240.52]  that I was,
[3240.64 --> 3241.16]  and like, you know,
[3241.20 --> 3242.24]  how well they think
[3242.24 --> 3242.84]  they're positioned
[3242.84 --> 3243.80]  and what their potential
[3243.80 --> 3244.68]  for growth is
[3244.68 --> 3245.80]  and what challenges
[3245.80 --> 3246.38]  could be.
[3246.56 --> 3247.88]  So, as you alluded to
[3247.88 --> 3249.16]  earlier on in the show,
[3249.32 --> 3250.42]  they did acknowledge
[3250.42 --> 3252.56]  that one of the reasons
[3252.56 --> 3253.50]  that they were profitable
[3253.50 --> 3254.50]  for the first six months
[3254.50 --> 3255.02]  of this year
[3255.02 --> 3255.94]  was actually due
[3255.94 --> 3257.12]  to the global pandemic
[3257.12 --> 3258.06]  and a lot of people
[3258.06 --> 3259.90]  becoming suddenly interested
[3259.90 --> 3261.56]  in upgrading their computers.
[3262.18 --> 3262.68]  So, they actually
[3262.68 --> 3263.72]  made a loss
[3263.72 --> 3266.32]  in every previous year
[3266.32 --> 3267.30]  that they reported here.
[3267.42 --> 3268.58]  You can tell from the bracket,
[3268.64 --> 3271.34]  oh, no, not August 24th, 2017
[3271.34 --> 3273.08]  to December 31st, 2017.
[3273.28 --> 3274.20]  Apparently, that was
[3274.20 --> 3275.34]  a money-making period
[3275.34 --> 3275.74]  for them.
[3275.88 --> 3277.20]  But they actually made a loss
[3277.20 --> 3278.16]  in the previous three
[3278.16 --> 3279.12]  reported periods,
[3279.24 --> 3280.28]  2018, 2019,
[3280.80 --> 3281.94]  and 2019,
[3283.16 --> 3284.02]  six months ended June.
[3284.14 --> 3285.12]  Oh, beginning of 2019.
[3285.78 --> 3286.98]  But then 2020,
[3287.28 --> 3288.20]  for the first six months,
[3288.30 --> 3289.10]  they made a profit,
[3289.24 --> 3289.96]  which they attributed
[3289.96 --> 3290.96]  in no small part
[3290.96 --> 3294.04]  to the COVID lockdown.
[3295.06 --> 3295.50]  Anyway,
[3295.86 --> 3296.54]  one of the things
[3296.54 --> 3297.06]  that, like, look,
[3297.16 --> 3298.26]  it just, it goes on
[3298.26 --> 3299.52]  forever and ever
[3299.52 --> 3300.78]  and ever and ever
[3300.78 --> 3302.20]  and ever and ever
[3302.20 --> 3302.70]  and ever.
[3302.86 --> 3303.52]  Like, what even,
[3303.74 --> 3304.18]  like, what even,
[3304.34 --> 3304.90]  what's this,
[3305.04 --> 3306.16]  what's this gamer pyramid?
[3306.32 --> 3306.72]  Hold on a second.
[3306.84 --> 3307.14]  And, like,
[3307.46 --> 3309.20]  not only are they
[3309.20 --> 3310.54]  doing well
[3310.54 --> 3311.40]  because they have, like,
[3311.48 --> 3312.72]  cases and cooling products
[3312.72 --> 3313.34]  and power supplies
[3313.34 --> 3314.28]  and storage drives
[3314.28 --> 3315.02]  and keyboards and mice,
[3315.12 --> 3315.94]  and all that kind of stuff
[3315.94 --> 3316.78]  that we've known them
[3316.78 --> 3317.52]  for for a long time.
[3317.64 --> 3318.42]  But very recently,
[3318.42 --> 3319.32]  they had acquisitions
[3319.32 --> 3319.96]  like Linus,
[3320.00 --> 3320.28]  I think,
[3320.36 --> 3321.80]  just set up with Elgato
[3321.80 --> 3323.64]  and Scuff Gaming
[3323.64 --> 3325.50]  and Origin PC.
[3325.74 --> 3325.84]  Yep.
[3326.46 --> 3327.20]  And, like,
[3327.26 --> 3328.12]  that's the amount
[3328.12 --> 3329.20]  of people that are moving
[3329.20 --> 3329.76]  into, I think,
[3329.88 --> 3330.46]  Twitch streaming
[3330.46 --> 3332.04]  was already really
[3332.04 --> 3333.04]  making a rise
[3333.04 --> 3335.06]  for PC purchases
[3335.06 --> 3336.30]  and PC players again
[3336.30 --> 3337.56]  after it had been
[3337.56 --> 3338.56]  falling for a long time.
[3338.68 --> 3339.30]  And then now
[3339.30 --> 3340.12]  that people are stuck
[3340.12 --> 3340.66]  inside,
[3340.94 --> 3341.64]  teachers are
[3341.64 --> 3343.86]  teaching from home
[3343.86 --> 3344.68]  if they don't want
[3344.68 --> 3345.52]  to cause disasters
[3345.52 --> 3347.58]  and all of these
[3347.58 --> 3348.04]  other things.
[3348.14 --> 3348.64]  People are getting
[3348.64 --> 3349.80]  into streaming
[3349.80 --> 3351.48]  not just for Twitch now,
[3351.64 --> 3352.04]  they're getting
[3352.04 --> 3352.54]  into streaming
[3352.54 --> 3353.30]  for meetings,
[3353.54 --> 3354.12]  for conferences,
[3354.46 --> 3355.84]  for teaching situations,
[3356.06 --> 3357.68]  for so many other reasons.
[3358.12 --> 3358.76]  And Elgato,
[3359.22 --> 3359.58]  like,
[3360.00 --> 3360.86]  matured
[3360.86 --> 3362.76]  at, like,
[3362.94 --> 3364.32]  exactly the right time.
[3364.56 --> 3364.98]  Oh, yeah,
[3365.04 --> 3365.50]  for sure.
[3365.86 --> 3367.18]  Their product stack,
[3367.68 --> 3369.74]  their packaging,
[3370.02 --> 3370.64]  the marketing,
[3370.78 --> 3370.92]  like,
[3371.00 --> 3371.92]  everything just
[3371.92 --> 3373.56]  finally got to the point
[3373.56 --> 3374.22]  where it's like,
[3374.30 --> 3375.58]  this is very professional
[3375.58 --> 3377.30]  and there's a set
[3377.30 --> 3378.04]  of products here
[3378.04 --> 3378.64]  that can solve
[3378.64 --> 3379.28]  pretty much all
[3379.28 --> 3380.30]  of my streaming problems
[3380.30 --> 3381.44]  and they all work
[3381.44 --> 3382.20]  together nicely,
[3382.52 --> 3383.06]  all that kind of stuff.
[3383.16 --> 3384.20]  They hit that point
[3384.20 --> 3385.40]  and COVID showed up.
[3385.50 --> 3385.62]  Like,
[3385.84 --> 3386.36]  right away.
[3386.38 --> 3386.86]  They were ready.
[3387.06 --> 3387.60]  It was crazy.
[3388.16 --> 3388.64]  Like,
[3388.82 --> 3390.04]  there's people in my life
[3390.04 --> 3391.74]  that I wouldn't expect
[3391.74 --> 3392.38]  to know almost
[3392.38 --> 3393.64]  any computer hardware name
[3393.64 --> 3394.76]  that are, like,
[3394.96 --> 3396.16]  very interested in Elgato.
[3396.66 --> 3398.46]  It's a wild experience.
[3398.46 --> 3399.70]  So,
[3399.94 --> 3400.08]  oh,
[3400.16 --> 3401.46]  just a quick side note.
[3401.56 --> 3402.26]  For those of you,
[3402.44 --> 3403.72]  I've been asked before,
[3404.16 --> 3404.46]  like,
[3404.96 --> 3405.84]  if I would take
[3405.84 --> 3406.92]  Linus Media Group Inc.
[3407.02 --> 3408.08]  public and,
[3408.20 --> 3408.48]  you know,
[3408.62 --> 3409.58]  when I say no,
[3409.88 --> 3410.44]  invariably,
[3410.80 --> 3412.10]  I've been asked why.
[3412.64 --> 3414.08]  That document alone
[3414.08 --> 3415.98]  is all the reason
[3415.98 --> 3416.74]  that I need
[3416.74 --> 3418.02]  to not do that
[3418.02 --> 3419.14]  because creating
[3419.14 --> 3419.96]  that document
[3419.96 --> 3420.98]  looks like
[3420.98 --> 3422.82]  the worst thing ever.
[3423.38 --> 3424.04]  And yes,
[3424.10 --> 3424.94]  a lot of it
[3424.94 --> 3425.74]  could be created
[3425.74 --> 3426.62]  by, you know,
[3426.66 --> 3427.18]  the lawyers
[3427.18 --> 3427.98]  who would be involved
[3427.98 --> 3429.16]  in a process like that.
[3429.26 --> 3430.34]  But a lot of that
[3430.34 --> 3431.28]  really looks like
[3431.28 --> 3432.70]  it has to be handcrafted
[3432.70 --> 3433.52]  by the executives
[3433.52 --> 3435.52]  that are laying out
[3435.52 --> 3436.70]  sort of their plan
[3436.70 --> 3437.36]  for the next,
[3437.54 --> 3437.98]  you know,
[3438.06 --> 3438.36]  one,
[3438.54 --> 3438.76]  two,
[3439.02 --> 3439.46]  five,
[3439.72 --> 3440.46]  ten years
[3440.46 --> 3441.02]  and, like,
[3441.26 --> 3442.24]  making this case
[3442.24 --> 3442.76]  for why,
[3443.12 --> 3443.92]  in this case,
[3444.04 --> 3444.76]  Corsair is trying
[3444.76 --> 3445.24]  to raise
[3445.24 --> 3447.08]  $100 million cash
[3447.08 --> 3449.38]  in return for
[3449.38 --> 3450.60]  a sale of some
[3450.60 --> 3451.56]  portion of the company.
[3451.66 --> 3452.70]  I don't actually know
[3452.70 --> 3453.82]  how much
[3453.82 --> 3455.04]  they're,
[3455.04 --> 3455.64]  how much
[3455.64 --> 3456.32]  they're valuing
[3456.32 --> 3457.04]  themselves at.
[3457.36 --> 3457.92]  Based on that,
[3457.94 --> 3458.20]  they're doing
[3458.20 --> 3459.26]  a billion dollars
[3459.26 --> 3460.04]  revenue a year
[3460.04 --> 3460.62]  right now.
[3461.30 --> 3461.58]  Like,
[3461.72 --> 3462.04]  what?
[3462.52 --> 3464.42]  Corsair has a billion dollars
[3464.42 --> 3465.14]  worth of memory
[3465.14 --> 3465.94]  and power supplies
[3465.94 --> 3466.36]  and stuff?
[3466.84 --> 3467.68]  I would say
[3467.68 --> 3468.24]  they probably
[3468.24 --> 3469.28]  think they're worth
[3469.28 --> 3469.70]  a lot,
[3469.92 --> 3470.74]  but, um...
[3470.74 --> 3471.68]  And streaming hardware.
[3471.94 --> 3472.20]  Yeah.
[3472.34 --> 3472.96]  Avogato stuff
[3472.96 --> 3473.84]  has been sold out
[3473.84 --> 3475.12]  like the whole year.
[3475.68 --> 3476.20]  Basically.
[3476.88 --> 3477.34]  Basically.
[3477.50 --> 3477.82]  Anyway,
[3478.38 --> 3479.68]  the biggest reason
[3479.68 --> 3480.84]  that I was digging
[3480.84 --> 3481.56]  into this
[3481.56 --> 3482.54]  was just
[3482.54 --> 3483.28]  my own
[3483.28 --> 3484.22]  personal
[3484.22 --> 3485.56]  idle curiosity
[3485.56 --> 3487.36]  because I wanted
[3487.36 --> 3487.84]  to know
[3487.84 --> 3488.40]  how much
[3488.40 --> 3488.82]  they spent
[3488.82 --> 3489.72]  on Origin PC.
[3490.28 --> 3491.46]  Ever since
[3491.46 --> 3492.42]  they announced
[3492.42 --> 3493.08]  the acquisition
[3493.08 --> 3494.02]  of Origin PC,
[3494.26 --> 3494.68]  I've been like...
[3498.28 --> 3500.02]  Yeah.
[3500.34 --> 3501.06]  But why?
[3501.48 --> 3502.24]  Why would you
[3502.24 --> 3502.80]  even do that?
[3502.92 --> 3504.00]  You're Corsair.
[3504.30 --> 3505.08]  Why are you
[3505.08 --> 3506.08]  buying Origin PC?
[3506.20 --> 3507.38]  It's like Logitech
[3507.38 --> 3507.92]  being like,
[3508.00 --> 3508.10]  yeah,
[3508.10 --> 3508.66]  we acquired
[3508.66 --> 3509.44]  Final Mouse.
[3509.68 --> 3509.98]  Like,
[3510.06 --> 3510.78]  nothing against
[3510.78 --> 3511.44]  Final Mouse.
[3511.90 --> 3513.28]  But Final Mouse
[3513.28 --> 3514.66]  is not relevant
[3514.66 --> 3516.32]  compared to Logitech
[3516.32 --> 3517.78]  in the peripheral space.
[3517.88 --> 3518.48]  You know what I mean?
[3518.80 --> 3518.98]  Like,
[3519.02 --> 3520.06]  it's kind of like...
[3520.06 --> 3521.18]  It's like, uh...
[3521.18 --> 3522.30]  They've got some...
[3522.30 --> 3523.56]  They did the Ninja Mouse.
[3524.78 --> 3525.26]  Like,
[3525.32 --> 3526.20]  I agree with you
[3526.20 --> 3526.78]  and you're right,
[3526.92 --> 3528.22]  but they're probably
[3528.22 --> 3529.10]  a little bit more relevant
[3529.10 --> 3529.58]  than you think.
[3530.14 --> 3530.54]  Uh,
[3530.86 --> 3532.04]  yeah.
[3532.74 --> 3534.04]  They're not Logitech.
[3534.60 --> 3534.86]  No.
[3535.10 --> 3535.56]  And I think
[3535.56 --> 3536.58]  they lost a lot of traction
[3536.58 --> 3537.64]  after the Ninja Mouse.
[3538.50 --> 3538.94]  So,
[3538.94 --> 3539.78]  so basically,
[3540.10 --> 3540.42]  you know,
[3540.56 --> 3541.28]  we're looking...
[3541.28 --> 3541.82]  So Corsair
[3541.82 --> 3542.54]  had already
[3542.54 --> 3543.10]  built out
[3543.10 --> 3543.96]  their own infrastructure
[3543.96 --> 3544.54]  around their
[3544.54 --> 3545.70]  Vengeance gaming PCs,
[3545.88 --> 3547.00]  which are fine.
[3547.38 --> 3547.92]  And then,
[3548.00 --> 3548.70]  as soon as
[3548.70 --> 3549.62]  the Origin acquisition
[3549.62 --> 3550.28]  happened,
[3550.28 --> 3550.96]  I mean,
[3551.12 --> 3552.32]  obviously this was
[3552.32 --> 3552.82]  going to happen,
[3552.94 --> 3553.66]  but over time,
[3554.16 --> 3554.50]  uh,
[3554.56 --> 3554.76]  you know,
[3554.80 --> 3555.60]  there's more and more
[3555.60 --> 3556.74]  Corsair products
[3556.74 --> 3557.60]  in Origin PCs,
[3558.34 --> 3558.96]  obviously.
[3558.96 --> 3560.44]  so what's the difference
[3560.44 --> 3561.18]  at a certain point?
[3561.24 --> 3562.28]  What is the difference
[3562.28 --> 3564.44]  between Corsair
[3564.44 --> 3565.28]  just doing
[3565.28 --> 3566.10]  Vengeance PCs
[3566.10 --> 3567.34]  with exclusive case
[3567.34 --> 3568.12]  designs from time
[3568.12 --> 3568.54]  to time
[3568.54 --> 3569.88]  and an Origin PC?
[3570.48 --> 3571.10]  And yes,
[3571.14 --> 3571.58]  I get it.
[3571.64 --> 3572.58]  The Origin team
[3572.58 --> 3572.94]  is, like,
[3572.98 --> 3573.50]  still working on
[3573.50 --> 3574.30]  Origin PC,
[3574.30 --> 3575.32]  but over time,
[3575.36 --> 3575.96]  as we've seen,
[3576.04 --> 3576.66]  whether it's Twitch
[3576.66 --> 3577.24]  or Oculus,
[3577.96 --> 3579.44]  the acquiring company
[3579.44 --> 3580.32]  eventually
[3580.32 --> 3582.28]  takes over
[3582.28 --> 3583.26]  in terms of culture,
[3583.26 --> 3583.68]  and I would be
[3583.68 --> 3584.38]  very surprised
[3584.38 --> 3585.02]  to see anything
[3585.02 --> 3586.48]  other than that
[3586.48 --> 3586.86]  happened.
[3586.96 --> 3587.60]  Not to mention
[3587.60 --> 3588.80]  that the PC
[3588.80 --> 3590.56]  assembly business,
[3590.66 --> 3591.22]  because I'm not
[3591.22 --> 3591.48]  going to,
[3591.48 --> 3592.40]  I'm not going to,
[3592.40 --> 3592.80]  um,
[3593.00 --> 3593.86]  call it anything,
[3594.14 --> 3594.52]  you know,
[3594.54 --> 3595.34]  higher than that.
[3595.68 --> 3597.16]  The PC assembly business
[3597.16 --> 3599.32]  is not a profitable one.
[3599.50 --> 3600.00]  Main Gear
[3600.00 --> 3601.22]  actually tried
[3601.22 --> 3602.06]  to raise money,
[3602.60 --> 3602.96]  uh,
[3602.96 --> 3603.32]  let's see,
[3603.38 --> 3603.94]  Main Gear,
[3604.18 --> 3604.62]  uh,
[3604.62 --> 3605.74]  financial statements,
[3605.86 --> 3606.26]  here we go.
[3606.60 --> 3606.94]  Main Gear
[3606.94 --> 3607.44]  tries to,
[3607.44 --> 3608.22]  tried to raise money
[3608.22 --> 3609.84]  back in the
[3609.84 --> 3610.64]  mid to,
[3610.80 --> 3611.90]  mid 2010s,
[3612.36 --> 3613.52]  and they released,
[3613.68 --> 3613.88]  uh,
[3613.88 --> 3614.94]  some financial statements
[3614.94 --> 3616.28]  for their 2016
[3616.28 --> 3618.66]  and 2015 years.
[3618.78 --> 3619.24]  I don't think any
[3619.24 --> 3620.16]  of this was ever audited,
[3620.30 --> 3620.60]  but, like,
[3620.66 --> 3621.20]  quite frankly,
[3621.28 --> 3622.44]  it's not impressive enough
[3622.44 --> 3623.22]  that I would think
[3623.22 --> 3623.88]  that they're lying.
[3624.54 --> 3624.94]  Um,
[3625.54 --> 3626.60]  here we go,
[3626.74 --> 3627.18]  here we go.
[3627.24 --> 3627.36]  So,
[3627.42 --> 3629.02]  in 2015 on,
[3630.04 --> 3630.66]  what is it?
[3630.70 --> 3630.84]  Like,
[3630.84 --> 3631.52]  what's a Main Gear
[3631.52 --> 3632.60]  computer cost?
[3633.64 --> 3634.04]  Like,
[3634.18 --> 3634.96]  somewhere between
[3634.96 --> 3635.92]  a thousand and,
[3635.92 --> 3636.26]  like,
[3636.32 --> 3636.52]  you know,
[3636.58 --> 3637.32]  five thousand,
[3637.50 --> 3638.34]  six thousand dollars,
[3638.46 --> 3639.14]  something like that.
[3639.22 --> 3639.44]  So,
[3639.90 --> 3640.46]  they've moved
[3640.46 --> 3641.72]  anywhere from,
[3642.12 --> 3643.68]  you know,
[3643.84 --> 3644.86]  six thousand,
[3645.06 --> 3646.12]  computers to,
[3646.56 --> 3646.88]  like,
[3647.00 --> 3647.28]  hold on,
[3647.28 --> 3647.56]  hold on,
[3647.62 --> 3647.90]  hold on,
[3647.90 --> 3648.78]  I'm doing some,
[3649.10 --> 3650.08]  I'm doing some bad,
[3650.20 --> 3651.56]  bad math here.
[3651.66 --> 3651.80]  So,
[3652.20 --> 3652.60]  six,
[3652.76 --> 3653.08]  let's,
[3653.14 --> 3653.64]  so let's,
[3653.72 --> 3654.22]  let's say
[3654.22 --> 3654.74]  seven,
[3654.88 --> 3656.00]  seven million dollars,
[3656.24 --> 3656.48]  okay,
[3656.56 --> 3657.30]  seven million dollars
[3657.30 --> 3658.94]  revenue across the two years,
[3659.02 --> 3660.46]  about 14 between the two years.
[3660.72 --> 3661.12]  So,
[3661.22 --> 3661.80]  divided by,
[3661.90 --> 3662.24]  I don't know,
[3662.32 --> 3663.10]  let's say an average
[3663.10 --> 3664.84]  sell price of fifteen hundred dollars.
[3664.90 --> 3664.98]  So,
[3665.04 --> 3665.30]  they moved,
[3665.38 --> 3665.58]  like,
[3666.20 --> 3667.26]  forty five hundred
[3667.26 --> 3668.38]  boxes,
[3668.68 --> 3669.14]  basically.
[3669.72 --> 3671.08]  That is a lot of work.
[3671.32 --> 3671.54]  That's,
[3671.56 --> 3672.28]  that's a lot of work
[3672.28 --> 3672.92]  to do in a year.
[3672.92 --> 3673.30]  Forty,
[3673.36 --> 3674.24]  forty five hundred
[3674.24 --> 3674.86]  computers,
[3675.70 --> 3675.84]  here,
[3675.96 --> 3676.02]  or,
[3676.26 --> 3676.38]  yeah,
[3676.48 --> 3677.30]  forty five hundred
[3677.30 --> 3678.24]  computers divided by
[3678.24 --> 3678.74]  365,
[3679.04 --> 3679.70]  assuming they're working
[3679.70 --> 3680.48]  seven days a week,
[3680.54 --> 3680.84]  they're building
[3680.84 --> 3681.88]  twelve computers a day.
[3681.96 --> 3682.18]  They're,
[3682.26 --> 3682.42]  they're,
[3682.50 --> 3683.56]  they're building machines.
[3684.48 --> 3686.08]  For a grand total of,
[3686.30 --> 3686.94]  in 2015,
[3687.26 --> 3688.60]  thirty nine thousand dollars
[3688.60 --> 3689.20]  in profit,
[3689.60 --> 3691.44]  and in 2016,
[3692.24 --> 3693.44]  three hundred and ten thousand
[3693.44 --> 3694.28]  dollars in profit.
[3694.44 --> 3695.36]  And you might look at that
[3695.36 --> 3695.60]  and go,
[3695.72 --> 3695.88]  wow,
[3696.66 --> 3697.02]  Linus,
[3697.46 --> 3697.78]  you know,
[3698.10 --> 3699.40]  what kind of monster are you?
[3699.74 --> 3700.60]  Three hundred thousand dollars,
[3700.66 --> 3701.70]  a lot of money to make in a year.
[3702.80 --> 3704.06]  And it is,
[3704.16 --> 3704.80]  from like,
[3704.98 --> 3706.90]  an individual standpoint.
[3707.50 --> 3708.74]  They're also a really old company,
[3708.84 --> 3708.92]  though,
[3708.96 --> 3709.24]  aren't they?
[3709.56 --> 3709.84]  Maingear?
[3711.54 --> 3711.90]  Oh,
[3712.08 --> 3712.46]  Maingear.
[3712.48 --> 3712.58]  Yeah,
[3712.60 --> 3713.38]  I'm looking at Maingear now.
[3713.84 --> 3714.34]  But yes,
[3714.42 --> 3715.46]  Maingear's been around a long time.
[3715.54 --> 3715.94]  I think,
[3716.38 --> 3716.84]  uh,
[3717.04 --> 3718.08]  ex-Alienware?
[3718.72 --> 3719.46]  After the acquisition?
[3719.68 --> 3720.12]  Can't remember.
[3720.30 --> 3720.50]  Uh,
[3720.50 --> 3721.42]  don't quote me on that.
[3721.54 --> 3721.78]  Anyway,
[3722.20 --> 3722.46]  uh,
[3722.46 --> 3723.26]  the point is,
[3723.42 --> 3723.68]  uh,
[3723.68 --> 3724.02]  2002.
[3724.36 --> 3724.60]  For,
[3724.70 --> 3725.44]  for personal,
[3725.56 --> 3726.02]  for like,
[3726.16 --> 3727.06]  personal earnings,
[3727.06 --> 3727.40]  yes,
[3727.78 --> 3728.80]  three hundred thousand dollars a year,
[3728.92 --> 3729.64]  it's a lot of money.
[3729.78 --> 3730.86]  For a business
[3730.86 --> 3733.40]  that needs to reinvest in itself,
[3734.14 --> 3735.58]  three hundred thousand dollars,
[3735.70 --> 3735.94]  it's like,
[3736.22 --> 3736.62]  terrifying.
[3737.00 --> 3737.46]  At least they did,
[3737.72 --> 3738.42]  and to be clear,
[3738.60 --> 3738.72]  I,
[3738.82 --> 3739.26]  I actually,
[3739.38 --> 3740.66]  I like the guys over at Maingear.
[3740.78 --> 3741.28]  Good guys.
[3741.30 --> 3741.98]  They do good stuff.
[3742.20 --> 3742.80]  Good guys.
[3743.16 --> 3743.36]  Yes.
[3743.38 --> 3743.64]  But it's,
[3743.70 --> 3746.22]  it's a very rough business to be in.
[3746.30 --> 3746.96]  It's tough.
[3748.34 --> 3749.74]  We didn't choose an easy
[3749.74 --> 3751.28]  line of work with Floatplane,
[3751.42 --> 3753.36]  and they didn't choose an easy line of work with,
[3753.36 --> 3754.04]  with Maingear.
[3754.14 --> 3754.36]  No,
[3754.46 --> 3754.88]  so that's,
[3754.88 --> 3756.44]  that is four percent,
[3756.44 --> 3757.74]  net profit.
[3758.36 --> 3760.56]  That's terrifying as a,
[3760.60 --> 3761.50]  as a business owner.
[3761.60 --> 3763.34]  And the craziest part is,
[3763.42 --> 3764.40]  digging around in here,
[3764.80 --> 3765.10]  like,
[3765.38 --> 3767.90]  I'm not finding the,
[3768.28 --> 3768.60]  you know,
[3768.64 --> 3770.02]  way that they're going to double that.
[3770.42 --> 3770.64]  Like,
[3770.66 --> 3771.02]  I don't,
[3771.10 --> 3771.92]  I don't see it.
[3772.00 --> 3772.68]  It's just that,
[3772.68 --> 3774.72]  that computer hardware is just,
[3774.72 --> 3776.12]  expensive,
[3776.58 --> 3777.00]  you know?
[3777.66 --> 3777.94]  Like,
[3779.00 --> 3779.18]  that,
[3779.24 --> 3779.46]  that,
[3779.52 --> 3781.10]  that's kind of all there is to it.
[3781.10 --> 3781.26]  It,
[3781.26 --> 3781.30]  it,
[3781.30 --> 3782.38]  it just costs a lot.
[3783.10 --> 3783.50]  Um,
[3784.30 --> 3785.02]  so that's,
[3785.16 --> 3785.56]  that's,
[3785.66 --> 3785.94]  uh,
[3786.38 --> 3786.72]  anyway,
[3786.86 --> 3788.78]  so that's what led me to believe that,
[3789.00 --> 3789.28]  like,
[3789.34 --> 3792.40]  the Origin acquisition must have been cheap or something.
[3793.56 --> 3794.00]  Finally,
[3794.10 --> 3796.52]  back to the Corsair IPO documents.
[3796.98 --> 3797.70]  So I found out,
[3797.76 --> 3798.32]  I dug in there,
[3798.38 --> 3798.86]  I found out,
[3798.98 --> 3803.38]  apparently it was $13.8 million for Origin PC,
[3803.38 --> 3806.30]  and 2 million of it was in,
[3806.30 --> 3806.72]  uh,
[3806.72 --> 3807.66]  Corsair stock,
[3807.96 --> 3808.94]  is my understanding.
[3809.18 --> 3810.06]  I'm not a lawyer.
[3810.54 --> 3813.32]  I'm not an expert when it comes to reading these sorts of documents.
[3813.92 --> 3814.40]  Um,
[3815.22 --> 3817.48]  but I found that absolutely fascinating.
[3817.62 --> 3819.00]  I kind of think maybe I should have,
[3819.08 --> 3821.60]  should have started a PC building business a little while ago,
[3821.60 --> 3825.98]  so that I could flip it for apparently $14 million to Corsair.
[3826.14 --> 3828.30]  There is no way,
[3828.48 --> 3832.54]  there's no way on this green earth that I would pay $14 million for Origin PC.
[3832.54 --> 3833.78]  No offense.
[3834.58 --> 3836.50]  Love the guys over at Origin PC.
[3836.90 --> 3837.72]  Good folks.
[3838.04 --> 3838.90]  Good people.
[3839.42 --> 3842.64]  There's no way that business was worth $14 million.
[3843.12 --> 3844.44]  No offense to Corsair.
[3844.84 --> 3847.94]  Y'all got fleeced real hard.
[3848.54 --> 3849.28]  I think.
[3849.50 --> 3849.82]  Just my,
[3849.90 --> 3851.02]  just my personal opinion.
[3851.50 --> 3852.24]  Personal opinion.
[3853.16 --> 3853.48]  Yeah.
[3853.72 --> 3854.12]  JMO.
[3855.64 --> 3856.06]  Yeah.
[3856.06 --> 3858.10]  And I could understand it again,
[3858.24 --> 3858.54]  uh,
[3859.10 --> 3862.52]  from like a things we do expansion standpoint,
[3862.54 --> 3865.00]  but they already built PCs.
[3865.64 --> 3865.92]  Yeah.
[3866.92 --> 3869.42]  They like literally already figured it out on their own.
[3870.02 --> 3870.46]  Um,
[3870.78 --> 3872.56]  and I think they did a decent job of it too.
[3872.78 --> 3873.00]  So.
[3873.44 --> 3873.86]  Yeah.
[3873.92 --> 3874.26]  Pretty weird.
[3875.70 --> 3876.48]  I don't know.
[3877.04 --> 3877.86]  I don't know,
[3877.92 --> 3878.16]  man.
[3878.30 --> 3878.76]  Anyway,
[3879.06 --> 3879.58]  um,
[3879.58 --> 3881.60]  in the SEC filing,
[3881.60 --> 3886.66]  it was noted that the global demand for PC gaming and streaming gear reached 36 billion in 2019.
[3886.96 --> 3888.90]  That's another thing is Corsair.
[3888.90 --> 3896.62]  One of the things in the document here actually was Corsair's position in a variety of different,
[3896.62 --> 3897.36]  or like their,
[3897.36 --> 3897.68]  their,
[3897.68 --> 3898.12]  um,
[3898.96 --> 3903.78]  like their market share position in a variety of different categories that they participate in.
[3903.84 --> 3903.92]  Yeah.
[3903.96 --> 3904.54]  Check this out.
[3905.42 --> 3905.72]  Uh,
[3905.72 --> 3907.30]  so that's one of the other concerns I have.
[3907.40 --> 3910.04]  36 billion for PC gaming and streaming gear.
[3910.50 --> 3913.18]  Corsair's already selling a billion dollars a year,
[3913.18 --> 3916.60]  and they are already number one in keyboards,
[3917.14 --> 3918.06]  high performance memory,
[3918.18 --> 3918.84]  computer cases,
[3919.00 --> 3919.82]  power supplies,
[3919.94 --> 3920.64]  and cooling.
[3921.04 --> 3923.92]  Number two in streaming gear and performance controllers.
[3924.34 --> 3925.14]  Number three in mice.
[3925.18 --> 3926.64]  And number four in gaming headsets.
[3927.18 --> 3932.12]  So one of the reasons that you invest in a company is if you think it's going to pay a strong dividend,
[3932.82 --> 3932.94]  or,
[3933.10 --> 3933.20]  well,
[3933.28 --> 3935.10]  the two reasons you invest in a company,
[3935.22 --> 3938.18]  or if you think it's going to pay strong dividends on an ongoing basis,
[3938.18 --> 3941.86]  because it's got like a good foundation to their business model.
[3941.86 --> 3942.88]  Or number two,
[3943.06 --> 3946.50]  if you think the stock's going to go full stonks mode to the moon,
[3946.96 --> 3951.32]  and you're going to be able to cash out of your investment in the company.
[3952.12 --> 3953.06]  So based on that,
[3953.10 --> 3956.52]  Corsair is looking at a total addressable market of 36 billion.
[3956.68 --> 3958.54]  They already sell a billion dollars a year.
[3958.70 --> 3960.60]  They already are at the top of,
[3960.78 --> 3961.42]  like,
[3961.58 --> 3963.68]  most of the categories that they participate in.
[3963.76 --> 3966.58]  And what is even left for Corsair to expand into?
[3967.30 --> 3968.12]  They're not going to,
[3968.12 --> 3971.84]  they're not going to acquire the expertise to start making motherboards anytime soon.
[3971.86 --> 3972.86]  or CPUs.
[3973.54 --> 3973.86]  So like,
[3977.12 --> 3977.92]  Corsair,
[3978.24 --> 3979.12]  they already make chairs.
[3979.32 --> 3980.66]  I was just like Corsair chairs.
[3980.98 --> 3981.16]  Nope.
[3981.22 --> 3981.88]  They already do that.
[3982.04 --> 3982.40]  Corsair,
[3982.50 --> 3983.14]  like hair product.
[3983.30 --> 3983.54]  Like what,
[3984.00 --> 3985.10]  where are they going from here?
[3986.26 --> 3986.96]  Same thing.
[3987.06 --> 3987.50]  Same thing.
[3987.58 --> 3988.68]  Unless they want to like,
[3989.18 --> 3989.52]  I mean,
[3989.56 --> 3990.04]  I don't know,
[3990.16 --> 3992.00]  maybe they raise a hundred million dollars and they're like,
[3992.00 --> 3992.18]  yeah,
[3992.18 --> 3993.88]  we're going to build like an SMD,
[3994.42 --> 3995.80]  like,
[3996.12 --> 3999.00]  like manufacturing facility or something.
[3999.12 --> 3999.62]  Like maybe,
[3999.72 --> 4000.14]  I don't know,
[4000.22 --> 4001.42]  but why?
[4001.54 --> 4004.60]  Like that's another business that is just horrendous.
[4004.98 --> 4007.82]  There are two companies that make money selling graphics cards.
[4008.18 --> 4008.40]  Yeah.
[4009.00 --> 4009.40]  Nvidia.
[4009.40 --> 4009.52]  Nvidia.
[4009.90 --> 4010.16]  Well,
[4010.26 --> 4010.78]  and Nvidia.
[4011.52 --> 4013.44]  I was going to say there's basically one.
[4015.36 --> 4017.18]  Like if you're an EVGA,
[4017.44 --> 4021.04]  even if you're like a golden boy valued partner of someone like an Nvidia,
[4021.24 --> 4022.36]  I would be floored.
[4022.36 --> 4026.26]  If you're making more than single digit gross margins on a graphics cards.
[4026.60 --> 4030.40]  That's why companies like EVGA were so desperate to get into power supplies,
[4030.52 --> 4030.72]  mice,
[4030.86 --> 4031.22]  keyboards.
[4031.76 --> 4032.12]  I mean,
[4032.34 --> 4033.06]  sound cards.
[4033.34 --> 4034.64]  That's how desperate EVGA is.
[4034.68 --> 4036.00]  They're making sound cards now.
[4037.76 --> 4039.62]  Like who even has a sound card anymore?
[4040.22 --> 4040.62]  No one.
[4040.62 --> 4044.78]  People in Twitch chat are coming up with different ideas like coarse hair.
[4045.26 --> 4046.32]  Coarse hair.
[4046.82 --> 4049.54]  And coarse hair.
[4049.54 --> 4052.68]  So Digi dude says over on float plane,
[4052.84 --> 4055.26]  Corsair did hybrid coolers for GPUs with MSI,
[4055.36 --> 4055.56]  right?
[4056.14 --> 4056.86]  Sort of.
[4057.12 --> 4063.16]  Corsair leveraged their partnership with Asetek and their fan designs to do a
[4063.16 --> 4065.46]  hybrid cooler in partnership with MSI.
[4065.64 --> 4068.64]  Corsair didn't design a graphics card at all.
[4069.62 --> 4070.70]  Or cool.
[4070.98 --> 4071.18]  Yeah.
[4072.88 --> 4075.46]  Digi dude says maybe Corsair should try and merge with MSI.
[4075.58 --> 4076.84]  There is no way.
[4077.36 --> 4078.04]  I would be,
[4078.14 --> 4079.32]  I'd be shocked.
[4079.54 --> 4079.80]  Also,
[4079.88 --> 4081.00]  MSI is pretty big company.
[4081.08 --> 4081.98]  I don't know if you realize this,
[4082.04 --> 4083.88]  but a lot of the brand names that you know,
[4083.98 --> 4084.64]  like ASUS,
[4084.82 --> 4085.16]  MSI,
[4085.24 --> 4085.54]  Gigabyte,
[4085.84 --> 4087.12]  they do a ton of work,
[4087.20 --> 4088.42]  not under their own brand names.
[4088.48 --> 4089.58]  They are huge companies.
[4094.52 --> 4097.92]  I'm actually kind of curious what MSI is annual revenue is.
[4097.92 --> 4100.10]  So MSI in,
[4100.36 --> 4100.92]  wait,
[4101.66 --> 4102.18]  hold on a second.
[4102.40 --> 4102.50]  Oh,
[4102.64 --> 4103.50]  Motorola solutions.
[4103.72 --> 4104.08]  No,
[4104.32 --> 4105.28]  micro star technology.
[4105.38 --> 4105.92]  I want this one.
[4105.92 --> 4109.02]  MSI is annual revenue.
[4109.02 --> 4111.08]  According to Owler anyway,
[4111.08 --> 4112.70]  is $4 billion.
[4114.30 --> 4115.16]  And remember,
[4115.30 --> 4117.56]  MSI is an actual manufacturer.
[4118.14 --> 4119.86]  The margins in manufacturing,
[4120.14 --> 4122.32]  especially when you also own your own brand name,
[4122.36 --> 4124.30]  like when you are vertically integrated like that,
[4124.54 --> 4127.36]  are much better than if you are rebranding.
[4127.86 --> 4128.30]  Like engineer,
[4128.34 --> 4129.50]  I'm not saying Corsair doesn't engineer.
[4129.50 --> 4130.34]  They engineer,
[4130.54 --> 4131.44]  but they are,
[4131.56 --> 4134.72]  they are putting their brand name on what someone else is actually producing in
[4134.72 --> 4135.26]  their own factory.
[4135.42 --> 4138.62]  Corsair to my knowledge does not own any factories.
[4139.08 --> 4143.54]  Now that may be not the case when it comes to things like DRAM assembly,
[4143.88 --> 4146.50]  but they don't own a DRAM fab.
[4147.28 --> 4150.10]  Like they do not produce DRAM chips.
[4150.34 --> 4151.50]  They would assemble modules.
[4151.50 --> 4153.76]  So they're,
[4153.76 --> 4159.32]  they're basically in every case integrating what someone else farther up the chain is actually
[4159.32 --> 4159.50]  building.
[4160.70 --> 4161.60]  And MSI,
[4161.68 --> 4163.66]  I guess you could say that about MSI as well,
[4163.72 --> 4167.08]  but they're just kind of one layer higher than Corsair.
[4167.86 --> 4169.12]  And not in every business.
[4169.24 --> 4169.36]  I mean,
[4169.38 --> 4171.14]  MSI has to buy power supplies from someone.
[4171.28 --> 4171.66]  So it's,
[4171.72 --> 4172.08]  I guess,
[4172.18 --> 4172.68]  very,
[4173.32 --> 4174.50]  it's,
[4175.54 --> 4175.96]  it's,
[4176.10 --> 4176.44]  it's,
[4176.48 --> 4176.72]  it's,
[4176.78 --> 4179.40]  it's a real mix where MSI's revenues come from.
[4179.40 --> 4182.36]  Whereas Corsair is almost entirely consumer facing as far as I know.
[4182.82 --> 4186.52]  And I would have to go into this report in more detail in order to be able to say that
[4186.52 --> 4187.12]  definitively,
[4187.20 --> 4189.12]  but I'm pretty sure that that's the case.
[4191.50 --> 4191.82]  Um,
[4193.06 --> 4194.14]  MSI has a lot of patents.
[4194.30 --> 4195.54]  They do buy stuff from multiple motherboards.
[4195.62 --> 4195.70]  Yeah,
[4195.80 --> 4196.28]  absolutely.
[4196.52 --> 4196.90]  MSI is,
[4196.94 --> 4197.90]  MSI is a big company.
[4198.62 --> 4200.28]  Did they say in the filing what the hundred million is for?
[4200.56 --> 4200.88]  Probably,
[4201.18 --> 4204.00]  but it was like a 200 page document and I didn't,
[4204.06 --> 4204.66]  I didn't read it all.
[4204.72 --> 4207.76]  It was mostly just in there to satisfy my own curiosity about stuff.
[4207.76 --> 4208.40]  Um,
[4209.72 --> 4212.56]  so I'm not going to hold you to this forever.
[4212.78 --> 4215.04]  I'm not going to bring up this when show in,
[4215.14 --> 4215.34]  you know,
[4215.38 --> 4216.44]  three years and be like,
[4216.54 --> 4218.88]  Luke,
[4219.42 --> 4221.30]  would you buy,
[4221.42 --> 4222.40]  would you buy Corsair?
[4223.40 --> 4223.88]  Uh,
[4223.96 --> 4225.56]  I'm not good at this stuff.
[4226.00 --> 4226.44]  Um,
[4226.96 --> 4229.16]  I think,
[4229.32 --> 4232.02]  so I'm not going to give you a direct answer right away.
[4232.10 --> 4232.56]  Give me a moment.
[4232.66 --> 4233.08]  I think,
[4233.36 --> 4235.88]  I think if you think that,
[4235.96 --> 4237.04]  especially in North America,
[4237.04 --> 4239.74]  because I'm assuming that's where Corsair is most popular.
[4240.46 --> 4240.86]  Um,
[4241.24 --> 4245.62]  I think if you think that COVID is going to keep dragging on for a significant period of time,
[4245.78 --> 4246.18]  I do.
[4246.90 --> 4247.46]  I would,
[4247.60 --> 4250.40]  I would definitely be interested in moving into it.
[4250.54 --> 4255.14]  Cause I do think a lot of this is very tightly tied to people being stuck at home.
[4255.14 --> 4257.86]  I do think they're going to continue to do pretty well.
[4257.96 --> 4260.62]  I think working from home is like,
[4260.68 --> 4261.74]  like that's going to be a trend.
[4262.22 --> 4262.44]  For sure.
[4262.44 --> 4266.52]  It's forced change for a lot of different people around the globe.
[4266.86 --> 4267.04]  Yep.
[4267.04 --> 4268.66]  Working from home is definitely going to be a trend.
[4268.78 --> 4270.68]  There's going to be offices that are like,
[4270.80 --> 4271.02]  huh,
[4271.76 --> 4274.68]  it's kind of nice to not pay for an office.
[4275.38 --> 4275.74]  100%.
[4275.74 --> 4276.34]  Or,
[4276.34 --> 4278.14]  or not pay for as much office.
[4278.14 --> 4280.48]  Maybe they have a certain amount of people,
[4280.48 --> 4281.10]  uh,
[4281.10 --> 4282.10]  still working in office,
[4282.10 --> 4282.70]  but they have,
[4282.76 --> 4283.44]  uh,
[4283.52 --> 4284.02]  uh,
[4284.02 --> 4285.12]  potentially more outside,
[4285.12 --> 4286.56]  or they have like,
[4286.56 --> 4287.22]  uh,
[4287.22 --> 4291.48]  half shift things where you come in for like half the week and the other guy comes in for half a week and you share an area.
[4291.56 --> 4291.70]  Somebody,
[4291.82 --> 4292.14]  I don't know.
[4292.24 --> 4294.34]  A lot of that kind of stuff is going to be happening though.
[4294.62 --> 4295.44]  Industrial space,
[4295.58 --> 4296.16]  company space,
[4296.24 --> 4297.54]  stuff like that in cities,
[4297.92 --> 4298.84]  wicked expensive.
[4299.08 --> 4299.34]  Oh yeah.
[4299.36 --> 4300.50]  If you can pay for less of it,
[4300.66 --> 4302.04]  you're gonna be saving a lot of money as a company.
[4302.06 --> 4304.26]  Did you hear about that company in California?
[4304.48 --> 4305.22]  Sorry to cut you off,
[4305.26 --> 4306.84]  but it totally ties into your point here.
[4307.22 --> 4308.84]  They ditched their headquarters,
[4309.68 --> 4311.28]  just sent everyone home.
[4311.28 --> 4311.32]  Um,
[4311.44 --> 4312.26]  and I think they're,
[4312.36 --> 4316.08]  they're doing like three or four all hands conferences a year.
[4316.16 --> 4316.90]  That's the plan.
[4317.10 --> 4317.36]  You know,
[4317.40 --> 4320.50]  obviously not doing that right now and still saving money.
[4320.90 --> 4321.74]  So it's like,
[4322.24 --> 4322.72]  that's,
[4322.84 --> 4324.12]  that's pretty sick.
[4324.20 --> 4324.64]  Actually.
[4324.80 --> 4327.52]  You still get that face to face interaction with your colleagues,
[4327.52 --> 4328.60]  but you can work from home.
[4329.16 --> 4329.74]  Heck yeah.
[4329.80 --> 4332.28]  And they were like still ahead on the deal or something stupid like that.
[4332.84 --> 4333.24]  I,
[4333.32 --> 4333.68]  I've,
[4333.74 --> 4334.08]  I've,
[4334.14 --> 4335.90]  I know you and I haven't really talked about it,
[4335.90 --> 4336.16]  but it's,
[4336.22 --> 4339.88]  it's been something I've legitimately been thinking about for flow plane.
[4340.28 --> 4340.64]  Um,
[4341.28 --> 4341.92]  and,
[4342.06 --> 4344.32]  and I actually hadn't heard of that.
[4344.40 --> 4347.36]  And I really liked that idea because the one thing that I've been
[4347.36 --> 4351.52]  hitching on this whole time is there is as cheesy as,
[4351.70 --> 4352.32]  as it is.
[4352.58 --> 4352.90]  Yeah.
[4352.92 --> 4354.88]  Team building is actually really important.
[4355.20 --> 4355.68]  A hundred percent.
[4355.76 --> 4356.18]  Um,
[4356.48 --> 4360.78]  and you do lose a lot of that having people not come in.
[4360.96 --> 4361.48]  Uh,
[4361.48 --> 4364.92]  and like every flow plane meetup that we've had has been really cool.
[4364.92 --> 4366.56]  And I think as,
[4366.56 --> 4367.68]  uh,
[4367.84 --> 4370.36]  as sometimes odd as they've been,
[4370.36 --> 4374.68]  where we just like spend tons of time brainstorming ideas during the day
[4374.68 --> 4377.70]  and then just like play video games and board games at night,
[4377.94 --> 4378.24]  whatever.
[4378.24 --> 4382.36]  Like they're not as traditional company retreatee as some company retreats
[4382.36 --> 4382.88]  may be.
[4382.88 --> 4384.02]  Who would expect me to be?
[4384.52 --> 4384.78]  Yeah.
[4384.84 --> 4386.60]  We like went to LTX and stuff,
[4386.60 --> 4386.98]  but like,
[4386.98 --> 4388.58]  I think they've been really cool and I've,
[4388.88 --> 4389.18]  it's,
[4389.26 --> 4395.00]  it's been really cool for me to like genuinely really enjoy spending time with the people
[4395.00 --> 4396.88]  that I work with in person where like,
[4396.88 --> 4398.54]  we don't really get to spend that much time together.
[4398.54 --> 4402.26]  Cause we largely work separately and we work at home,
[4402.26 --> 4403.18]  uh,
[4403.72 --> 4407.32]  and not being able to have that meetup meetup because of COVID has really sucked,
[4407.32 --> 4408.24]  but doing them,
[4408.24 --> 4409.60]  like if we did them quarterly,
[4409.90 --> 4410.58]  something like that,
[4410.86 --> 4411.84]  that could be really cool.
[4412.04 --> 4412.16]  Yeah.
[4412.48 --> 4414.50]  I think that would be really cool,
[4414.74 --> 4418.58]  especially because creator warehouse is hiring so much and so fast.
[4418.58 --> 4420.48]  That might just be the best plan.
[4420.64 --> 4423.08]  I don't know if we're going to have a space for you anyway.
[4423.08 --> 4423.78]  I've been,
[4423.88 --> 4425.52]  I've been a little worried about that.
[4425.70 --> 4426.06]  Um,
[4426.56 --> 4430.82]  Nick wants to hire like four or five more people in like the next few months.
[4431.24 --> 4431.68]  Wow.
[4432.04 --> 4432.44]  Um,
[4432.58 --> 4433.02]  uh,
[4434.12 --> 4436.02]  it is,
[4436.14 --> 4436.76]  I don't know,
[4436.88 --> 4437.88]  faster internet connections.
[4438.18 --> 4438.28]  They're,
[4438.28 --> 4441.58]  they're being able to expense your internet.
[4441.70 --> 4442.66]  That's a good thing.
[4443.32 --> 4443.60]  That's,
[4443.74 --> 4447.22]  we would probably have to shift to stuff like that.
[4447.26 --> 4448.90]  Supporting people's purchasing of,
[4449.02 --> 4451.42]  of like ergonomic things for their home and,
[4451.42 --> 4453.42]  and internet connections and stuff like that.
[4453.50 --> 4453.88]  And that's fine.
[4453.96 --> 4455.18]  Please support that by the way.
[4455.24 --> 4455.60]  So no,
[4455.66 --> 4456.16]  no problem.
[4456.76 --> 4456.92]  No,
[4457.00 --> 4460.50]  I love how we're having like a biz dev discussion just live on.
[4460.86 --> 4461.52]  I know,
[4461.58 --> 4461.76]  right.
[4462.28 --> 4462.60]  Uh,
[4462.60 --> 4465.50]  there's been some questions about this from float plane people.
[4465.72 --> 4466.08]  Um,
[4466.08 --> 4467.88]  like what our approach there is going to be.
[4467.94 --> 4469.02]  And I just haven't really known.
[4469.12 --> 4471.68]  So I guess here's your partial answer.
[4471.74 --> 4472.88]  I'm sure we'll continue to discuss.
[4472.88 --> 4473.58]  Stop stalling.
[4473.68 --> 4474.86]  Stop stalling Luke.
[4475.86 --> 4476.26]  Oh,
[4476.34 --> 4476.56]  okay.
[4476.68 --> 4476.94]  Okay.
[4477.10 --> 4478.06]  Jumping back to Corsair.
[4478.20 --> 4478.50]  Yeah.
[4478.50 --> 4478.86]  Um,
[4479.26 --> 4479.78]  I don't know.
[4479.78 --> 4482.32]  I don't really like messing around with stock stuff.
[4482.44 --> 4484.10]  So like personally,
[4484.34 --> 4485.28]  such a cop out.
[4485.38 --> 4486.46]  What a cop out.
[4486.76 --> 4487.20]  Personally.
[4487.56 --> 4489.08]  I mean,
[4489.08 --> 4489.68]  cause the,
[4489.72 --> 4490.48]  the problem is,
[4490.60 --> 4493.50]  is I could rectify this question.
[4493.50 --> 4495.92]  Like right when this IPO goes public.
[4496.64 --> 4497.64]  So if you were like,
[4497.82 --> 4499.08]  would you buy it?
[4499.08 --> 4500.66]  I would have to actually buy it.
[4500.66 --> 4501.44]  If I said yes,
[4501.44 --> 4502.96]  or else I'd just be a liar.
[4503.66 --> 4504.18]  Okay.
[4504.26 --> 4505.50]  And I'm not going to buy it.
[4505.58 --> 4506.52]  So no.
[4506.64 --> 4507.00]  All right.
[4507.06 --> 4507.74]  That's fair.
[4507.74 --> 4508.46]  That's fair.
[4508.56 --> 4514.06]  How about hypothetical Luke that does invest in stocks then more,
[4514.06 --> 4514.86]  more actively.
[4515.20 --> 4515.60]  Um,
[4517.06 --> 4518.00]  maybe I,
[4518.00 --> 4524.04]  I think I would be worried about the hype around it because I think a lot of
[4524.04 --> 4525.48]  people are going to look at it and go like,
[4525.64 --> 4526.02]  Oh,
[4526.16 --> 4529.46]  computer stuff that has like a lot of streaming things built into it around
[4529.46 --> 4529.78]  COVID.
[4529.94 --> 4530.78]  Let's go in.
[4530.78 --> 4532.52]  I think there's going to be a lot of that reaction.
[4532.70 --> 4534.74]  So I think I would hold back from the initial.
[4535.14 --> 4538.90]  Cause I don't really fully know how like buying right on an IPO works.
[4538.90 --> 4542.50]  If you're able to get at their launch price and then sell within like
[4542.50 --> 4543.86]  almost 24 hours.
[4543.96 --> 4545.18]  So you would go short.
[4545.58 --> 4545.84]  Uh,
[4545.84 --> 4546.44]  this is great.
[4546.54 --> 4546.76]  X,
[4546.82 --> 4546.94]  X,
[4547.00 --> 4547.98]  random Delta X,
[4548.04 --> 4548.82]  X on Twitch,
[4549.06 --> 4551.04]  hypothetical Luke that buys things.
[4552.08 --> 4552.82]  Nailed it.
[4553.54 --> 4553.90]  Absolutely.
[4553.90 --> 4555.98]  You just nailed it.
[4556.30 --> 4558.54]  Comment of the year right there.
[4558.70 --> 4560.36]  We don't even need the rest of this year.
[4560.48 --> 4561.14]  That was it.
[4561.52 --> 4563.36]  A hypothetical Luke that spends money.
[4563.46 --> 4564.98]  That is truly hypothetical says.
[4565.16 --> 4565.44]  Oh,
[4566.92 --> 4567.92]  that's hilarious.
[4568.72 --> 4569.20]  Um,
[4569.30 --> 4569.52]  all right.
[4569.56 --> 4570.24]  Some people are wondering,
[4570.42 --> 4570.80]  I guess,
[4570.90 --> 4574.60]  I guess I would go short and that's not because I don't think they're a good
[4574.60 --> 4575.64]  company or anything like that.
[4575.64 --> 4578.36]  I just think the hype around it and the,
[4578.42 --> 4578.76]  the,
[4578.88 --> 4579.16]  like,
[4579.54 --> 4581.76]  I know things that COVID is going on.
[4581.80 --> 4582.74]  I'm going to big brain this.
[4582.74 --> 4585.94]  I think there's going to be a lot of that and it's going to temporarily
[4585.94 --> 4587.28]  boost it.
[4587.42 --> 4588.00]  That's fair.
[4588.40 --> 4588.80]  Um,
[4589.24 --> 4591.46]  we've got a couple other float plane comments here.
[4591.82 --> 4592.22]  Uh,
[4592.56 --> 4592.92]  hold on.
[4592.96 --> 4593.36]  What's this?
[4593.44 --> 4594.64]  Remember three,
[4594.94 --> 4595.82]  three and G bro.
[4595.86 --> 4596.38]  And Brock.
[4596.70 --> 4599.62]  Remember when LTT used to be a tech channel and not a clothing brand.
[4599.72 --> 4600.00]  Okay.
[4600.28 --> 4601.56]  We are still a tech channel.
[4601.72 --> 4605.92]  I've actually got an upcoming video that I'm going to tease real quick here.
[4605.92 --> 4606.70]  We are doing,
[4606.86 --> 4608.68]  how does LMG make money V2?
[4609.32 --> 4609.76]  Cool.
[4609.96 --> 4612.72]  And it's going to include the merch business in it.
[4612.74 --> 4614.72]  And if these numbers are accurate,
[4614.84 --> 4616.32]  which they don't actually look right to me.
[4616.44 --> 4617.28]  So I was going to,
[4617.28 --> 4620.10]  I was going to ask some questions about them,
[4620.10 --> 4624.88]  but if these numbers are accurate and my Google sheets will ever load,
[4624.98 --> 4630.10]  then I was going to give you guys a teaser here for how much of our revenue
[4630.10 --> 4631.50]  actually comes from merch.
[4632.08 --> 4632.52]  Uh,
[4632.52 --> 4633.02]  and it's,
[4633.22 --> 4633.34]  wow,
[4633.34 --> 4634.66]  it's really taking a very,
[4634.78 --> 4635.66]  very long time to load.
[4635.72 --> 4636.12]  How about,
[4636.24 --> 4636.76]  how about,
[4637.02 --> 4638.54]  how about we download the Excel?
[4638.64 --> 4639.08]  What do you think?
[4639.14 --> 4639.92]  What do you think of that?
[4640.02 --> 4640.20]  Yeah.
[4640.28 --> 4640.92]  You like that?
[4640.96 --> 4641.26]  And you like,
[4641.38 --> 4642.14]  what do you think of that?
[4642.26 --> 4642.60]  Okay.
[4642.66 --> 4643.18]  There we go.
[4643.78 --> 4644.04]  Uh,
[4644.04 --> 4644.78]  so that's done,
[4644.94 --> 4647.10]  but it's not open in Excel yet.
[4647.10 --> 4648.36]  Cause it's being stupid and slow.
[4648.58 --> 4649.54]  Come on,
[4650.12 --> 4650.52]  come on.
[4650.52 --> 4651.96]  I got a live show to run here.
[4652.40 --> 4654.24]  And then there was another one.
[4654.30 --> 4654.66]  Rod,
[4654.78 --> 4655.32]  Rod's,
[4655.32 --> 4655.50]  uh,
[4655.50 --> 4656.56]  posting in the float plane chat.
[4656.56 --> 4658.60]  there's people who are wondering what creator warehouse is.
[4658.72 --> 4660.06]  Creator warehouse is the merge team.
[4661.18 --> 4661.62]  Um,
[4662.10 --> 4662.92]  and okay,
[4663.00 --> 4663.50]  here we go.
[4663.50 --> 4663.94]  So,
[4665.38 --> 4672.84]  merch is clothing and other 16%.
[4672.84 --> 4677.10]  And I don't know if that's revenue or profit right now.
[4677.10 --> 4679.90]  I can tell you that if it's revenue,
[4680.48 --> 4680.94]  it's,
[4681.06 --> 4681.56]  um,
[4682.20 --> 4685.30]  that number is like higher sounding than,
[4685.86 --> 4686.30]  um,
[4686.68 --> 4692.66]  like it's less impressive than it sounds because profit on merch compared to revenue is much
[4692.66 --> 4696.14]  lower than when you're selling like views,
[4696.32 --> 4696.98]  you know,
[4697.02 --> 4697.80]  like influence.
[4698.42 --> 4698.98]  Um,
[4699.04 --> 4699.24]  well,
[4699.28 --> 4699.70]  sort of,
[4699.76 --> 4703.38]  because you also have a lot of overhead that goes along with making videos,
[4703.48 --> 4703.94]  I guess.
[4704.38 --> 4705.56]  So it's just how you do the math.
[4706.20 --> 4706.60]  Um,
[4707.32 --> 4707.62]  yeah.
[4707.66 --> 4710.04]  So there's a labor cost to making videos,
[4710.04 --> 4713.24]  but then there's also a labor cost and a materials cost to making merch,
[4713.24 --> 4718.22]  which is one of the reasons that I actually shied away from getting into physical merch for so long,
[4718.32 --> 4718.80]  even though,
[4719.26 --> 4719.50]  you know,
[4719.56 --> 4720.98]  everyone in their dog,
[4721.12 --> 4721.34]  like,
[4721.40 --> 4721.62]  you know,
[4721.72 --> 4722.10]  merch,
[4722.30 --> 4722.68]  uh,
[4722.94 --> 4724.58]  companies like Teespring or whatever were like,
[4724.62 --> 4724.74]  yeah,
[4724.74 --> 4727.74]  you guys should like get hardcore into merch because you can make so much money.
[4727.80 --> 4728.16]  I was like,
[4728.28 --> 4728.78]  ah,
[4728.96 --> 4730.42]  it just doesn't seem like a great business.
[4730.50 --> 4732.66]  You got all this inventory and all this liability,
[4732.96 --> 4733.12]  like,
[4733.20 --> 4733.50]  eh,
[4733.50 --> 4733.92]  I don't know.
[4734.32 --> 4734.60]  Uh,
[4734.60 --> 4734.90]  it's been,
[4735.00 --> 4735.72]  it's been pretty good.
[4735.82 --> 4736.86]  It's been pretty good for us.
[4737.04 --> 4741.20]  So should I check the straw poll first or should I give my answer first?
[4743.28 --> 4743.68]  Uh,
[4744.16 --> 4744.68]  I,
[4744.80 --> 4746.24]  I think you should answer first.
[4746.32 --> 4746.98]  You should make me answer.
[4747.20 --> 4747.94]  Absolutely not.
[4748.32 --> 4748.98]  Absolutely not.
[4749.84 --> 4751.48]  Would you do what I said?
[4751.76 --> 4751.98]  Nope.
[4752.94 --> 4753.12]  No,
[4753.20 --> 4754.94]  I don't even think there's going to be a lot of hype around it.
[4754.98 --> 4761.20]  I think that the PC enthusiast community thinks it's really big in the grand scheme of things.
[4761.20 --> 4763.08]  It's not very big.
[4763.08 --> 4770.64]  And what moves like major amounts of money on the NASDAQ is mainstream,
[4770.64 --> 4772.72]  mainstream appeal,
[4772.86 --> 4773.78]  mainstream acceptance.
[4773.78 --> 4777.24]  like I was listening to Jim Cramer talk about AMD.
[4777.24 --> 4778.58]  And it was just,
[4778.58 --> 4782.96]  it was clear that he's informed about them from like a business standpoint,
[4782.96 --> 4784.96]  but he,
[4784.96 --> 4790.90]  he seemed to think that like a seven nanometer chip was somehow like,
[4790.90 --> 4791.90]  like,
[4792.00 --> 4792.18]  like,
[4792.18 --> 4793.58]  like if you had the seven nanometer,
[4793.76 --> 4795.94]  you like had the key to success.
[4795.94 --> 4798.88]  When actually it's not that simple.
[4799.12 --> 4799.36]  Um,
[4799.36 --> 4801.54]  you could have a bad seven nanometer chip.
[4801.90 --> 4802.26]  Um,
[4802.86 --> 4803.72]  you can have a good,
[4804.02 --> 4804.30]  you know,
[4804.36 --> 4805.32]  10 nanometer chip.
[4805.40 --> 4807.46]  You could have a bad 14 nanometer chip.
[4807.52 --> 4808.46]  You could have a lot of,
[4808.46 --> 4810.86]  lot of bad 14 nanometer chips.
[4810.96 --> 4812.00]  It's all like,
[4812.00 --> 4815.32]  like he didn't really understand like the technology.
[4815.42 --> 4816.86]  He didn't really understand what he was talking about.
[4816.86 --> 4817.50]  Um,
[4817.56 --> 4818.66]  with respect to that,
[4818.76 --> 4821.00]  even though like his advice overall,
[4821.00 --> 4822.86]  like his analysis was actually,
[4822.86 --> 4823.98]  I thought very good.
[4824.32 --> 4824.48]  Um,
[4824.48 --> 4825.80]  this was an article a little while ago,
[4825.80 --> 4826.44]  so don't,
[4826.52 --> 4829.42]  don't be running and looking at it and like making a decision based on its old
[4829.42 --> 4830.18]  news at this point.
[4830.18 --> 4830.50]  But,
[4830.60 --> 4830.88]  um,
[4831.32 --> 4832.46]  it was sort of a,
[4832.46 --> 4833.16]  a reflection,
[4833.16 --> 4834.12]  uh,
[4834.14 --> 4836.66]  moment for me because I was listening to that going like,
[4836.72 --> 4836.92]  yeah,
[4837.66 --> 4840.30]  that's how like an average investor,
[4840.42 --> 4841.52]  not even an average investor.
[4841.52 --> 4845.14]  That's how an educated investor is looking at these companies.
[4845.14 --> 4848.74]  And I think if that's the amount of understanding that someone like a Jim
[4848.74 --> 4849.94]  Cramer has of,
[4850.06 --> 4850.20]  you know,
[4850.26 --> 4853.62]  process node technology and the importance to a company like AMD or Intel,
[4854.14 --> 4856.02]  like imagining the average investor,
[4856.02 --> 4856.94]  um,
[4856.94 --> 4861.72]  looking at Corsair's portfolio and thinking that keyboards with colorful lights
[4861.72 --> 4864.30]  on them are going to be the next like Apple Inc.
[4865.30 --> 4865.62]  Uh,
[4865.98 --> 4866.90]  I doubt it.
[4866.96 --> 4871.28]  I doubt there's going to be that kind of like rabid fanboyism around them.
[4871.28 --> 4874.14]  And I doubt there's going to be that kind of momentum where you could just
[4874.14 --> 4876.70]  buy it and flip it a couple of days later for a big profit.
[4877.54 --> 4877.82]  You know,
[4877.82 --> 4879.10]  it'd be really interesting.
[4879.80 --> 4880.24]  Um,
[4880.64 --> 4884.46]  and I would love for someone else to do this because as the,
[4884.46 --> 4886.06]  the quote of the year said,
[4886.10 --> 4887.60]  I'm clearly not the one to do it.
[4887.86 --> 4888.34]  Um,
[4888.40 --> 4892.34]  but an investment bot that was given some,
[4892.44 --> 4893.18]  I don't know,
[4893.18 --> 4896.68]  some amount of money that acted based on Google trends data.
[4897.90 --> 4898.38]  Ooh,
[4898.70 --> 4899.08]  interesting.
[4899.08 --> 4904.66]  So it crawled Google trends data and tried to make investment predictions
[4904.66 --> 4907.32]  based on that.
[4908.20 --> 4908.80]  Interesting.
[4910.08 --> 4910.64]  Okay.
[4911.06 --> 4916.70]  So Corsair interest over time since,
[4916.70 --> 4917.64]  uh,
[4918.64 --> 4919.10]  Q4,
[4919.20 --> 4924.20]  2019 or late Q3 has gone up a bit,
[4924.20 --> 4927.90]  but it's down off its peak in April of this year.
[4929.10 --> 4929.92]  So there you go.
[4930.06 --> 4930.14]  Honestly,
[4930.22 --> 4932.08]  that might kind of make sense.
[4932.16 --> 4932.30]  Oh,
[4932.36 --> 4932.56]  wait.
[4932.66 --> 4932.84]  Well,
[4932.90 --> 4933.88]  all related topics,
[4934.02 --> 4934.28]  Lincoln,
[4934.52 --> 4935.58]  MKX SUV.
[4936.02 --> 4936.16]  Oh,
[4936.26 --> 4936.46]  derp,
[4936.52 --> 4936.84]  derp.
[4937.00 --> 4937.44]  Uh,
[4938.44 --> 4938.82]  okay.
[4938.84 --> 4940.34]  Why don't we try Corsair memory?
[4942.70 --> 4943.10]  Well,
[4943.14 --> 4943.58]  and like,
[4943.66 --> 4944.00]  uh,
[4944.00 --> 4946.18]  I think we can try Elgato,
[4946.32 --> 4946.74]  Elgato,
[4946.86 --> 4947.22]  Elgato.
[4947.34 --> 4947.58]  All right.
[4947.76 --> 4950.10]  I think you'd have to feed it a fair amount.
[4950.10 --> 4952.82]  Cause it would have to know like what things really related to it.
[4952.88 --> 4953.08]  Okay.
[4953.08 --> 4955.56]  So Elgato peaked in March and April,
[4955.68 --> 4955.84]  March,
[4955.92 --> 4956.66]  April of this year,
[4957.44 --> 4957.78]  may.
[4959.56 --> 4962.58]  I don't know if you'd want to feed it because wasn't,
[4962.64 --> 4963.52]  wasn't like zoom.
[4963.64 --> 4966.68]  Didn't everyone like invest in the wrong zoom or something?
[4967.00 --> 4967.28]  Oh,
[4967.28 --> 4967.86]  I don't know.
[4968.32 --> 4970.70]  I remember something happened with that.
[4970.80 --> 4971.28]  Um,
[4972.88 --> 4973.86]  wrong zoom.
[4974.02 --> 4975.62]  That auto completed in Google for me.
[4975.78 --> 4979.66]  The sec really wants investors to stop buying the wrong zoom stock.
[4979.66 --> 4981.08]  Oh Lordy.
[4981.78 --> 4982.42]  So like,
[4982.50 --> 4983.16]  that's unfortunate.
[4983.66 --> 4984.88]  Maybe it doesn't matter.
[4984.88 --> 4985.38]  Like the,
[4985.46 --> 4986.50]  like I was saying like,
[4986.58 --> 4987.04]  uh,
[4987.16 --> 4988.96]  you should make sure that,
[4989.04 --> 4989.96]  uh,
[4990.14 --> 4990.48]  the,
[4990.60 --> 4993.16]  the crawler knows to look for things like Elgato,
[4993.30 --> 4994.78]  even though they're a part of Corsair,
[4994.86 --> 4998.06]  maybe not because it doesn't actually matter.
[4998.06 --> 5000.12]  Like the reality doesn't really matter.
[5000.20 --> 5001.10]  It's public perception,
[5001.10 --> 5001.46]  right?
[5003.26 --> 5003.74]  Oh,
[5003.76 --> 5004.76]  this is terrible.
[5005.00 --> 5006.20]  So zoom video,
[5006.62 --> 5008.56]  when everyone was into zoom video communications,
[5008.56 --> 5014.16]  a bunch of people accidentally invested in zoom technologies who spiked way up.
[5014.84 --> 5021.10]  And then unfortunately it's a defunct company based in China that previously distributed wireless communication products,
[5021.14 --> 5023.44]  no longer operates and does not generate revenue.
[5025.10 --> 5025.78]  Lordy.
[5025.78 --> 5028.14]  Oh,
[5028.28 --> 5029.46]  and the actual zoom,
[5029.78 --> 5032.92]  which like probably should have received that spike,
[5032.92 --> 5034.64]  like got a,
[5034.70 --> 5035.48]  I mean,
[5035.48 --> 5036.68]  it got a nice bump,
[5036.68 --> 5042.38]  but not what you'd expect for the amount of like publicity and stuff that was happening.
[5042.38 --> 5044.56]  How do you buy the wrong stock?
[5044.88 --> 5045.36]  Lordy.
[5045.92 --> 5046.46]  All right.
[5046.80 --> 5047.06]  Well,
[5047.10 --> 5048.06]  this is what I'm talking about.
[5048.08 --> 5048.56]  So like maybe,
[5048.56 --> 5052.22]  maybe the crawler shouldn't even be that smart because it has to like,
[5052.22 --> 5055.28]  the truly average investor.
[5055.54 --> 5056.02]  Yeah.
[5056.66 --> 5057.26]  So like,
[5057.30 --> 5059.20]  maybe you shouldn't actually make it that good.
[5059.32 --> 5061.12]  And it should just go off like very basic,
[5061.12 --> 5061.82]  uh,
[5061.82 --> 5062.70]  Google trends data.
[5062.70 --> 5063.50]  Okay.
[5063.56 --> 5063.70]  Well,
[5063.74 --> 5066.56]  I think you're overestimating the importance of Elgato.
[5066.72 --> 5067.92]  It's a very small,
[5068.12 --> 5069.06]  small portion.
[5069.28 --> 5069.42]  No,
[5069.48 --> 5073.16]  I was just talking generally because a lot of awareness.
[5073.70 --> 5074.14]  Yeah.
[5074.26 --> 5074.48]  Right.
[5074.84 --> 5077.64]  A lot of celebrities are like getting into streaming all of a sudden.
[5077.64 --> 5078.72]  So they'd have this awareness.
[5078.72 --> 5079.64]  So that's something.
[5080.24 --> 5080.54]  All right.
[5080.54 --> 5081.04]  That's fair.
[5081.20 --> 5081.80]  That's fair.
[5082.48 --> 5082.90]  All right.
[5082.98 --> 5083.50]  That's fair.
[5084.32 --> 5084.88]  But yeah,
[5084.88 --> 5085.14]  I don't,
[5085.18 --> 5085.50]  I don't know.
[5085.62 --> 5085.72]  I,
[5085.86 --> 5087.18]  I'm not into this kind of stuff.
[5087.54 --> 5089.38]  I find some of the,
[5090.84 --> 5091.28]  like,
[5091.28 --> 5094.70]  I would find it very interesting to see,
[5094.88 --> 5098.52]  read reports and potentially watch videos about like that.
[5098.58 --> 5101.14]  That's example that I gave the,
[5101.14 --> 5101.36]  uh,
[5101.36 --> 5102.92]  the crawler bot making investments,
[5102.92 --> 5105.02]  but I'm not that interested in it personally.
[5105.18 --> 5105.40]  Yeah.
[5105.54 --> 5106.54]  I'd follow the news.
[5106.64 --> 5108.10]  I I'd love to be proven wrong.
[5108.10 --> 5109.38]  Like I,
[5109.38 --> 5111.26]  I love the guys over at Corsair,
[5111.44 --> 5111.90]  um,
[5111.90 --> 5112.62]  top to bottom,
[5112.76 --> 5113.34]  good people,
[5113.34 --> 5114.70]  but I just,
[5114.80 --> 5115.18]  I don't know.
[5115.26 --> 5115.44]  I,
[5115.44 --> 5115.68]  I,
[5115.68 --> 5116.16]  I don't,
[5116.26 --> 5116.38]  I,
[5116.54 --> 5116.70]  I,
[5116.70 --> 5117.14]  again,
[5117.26 --> 5117.52]  again,
[5117.58 --> 5118.18]  remember too,
[5118.24 --> 5118.46]  though,
[5118.52 --> 5121.26]  that this is through the filter of someone who does not,
[5121.26 --> 5124.58]  buy and does not own any stocks whatsoever.
[5124.58 --> 5125.46]  I own nothing.
[5125.54 --> 5126.04]  No crypto,
[5126.20 --> 5126.76]  no stocks,
[5126.86 --> 5127.44]  no bonds,
[5127.98 --> 5128.36]  nothing.
[5129.36 --> 5129.88]  Um,
[5129.98 --> 5130.32]  all right.
[5130.36 --> 5131.18]  So let's go ahead.
[5131.94 --> 5132.38]  Results.
[5133.86 --> 5134.30]  Okay.
[5135.24 --> 5140.26]  56% would buy Corsair stock out of our audience here.
[5140.76 --> 5141.20]  Now.
[5141.20 --> 5142.38]  So this is where,
[5142.48 --> 5142.98]  this is where,
[5143.06 --> 5143.34]  like,
[5143.44 --> 5146.08]  I guarantee you those numbers are wrong.
[5146.76 --> 5147.12]  Yeah,
[5147.14 --> 5147.60]  that's fair.
[5147.70 --> 5147.88]  Uh,
[5147.88 --> 5148.04]  sorry.
[5148.14 --> 5148.48]  Give me,
[5148.64 --> 5148.78]  give me,
[5148.82 --> 5148.92]  oh,
[5149.00 --> 5149.14]  shoot.
[5149.22 --> 5150.08]  Give me one second.
[5150.40 --> 5150.58]  Stall,
[5150.72 --> 5150.96]  stall,
[5151.10 --> 5151.62]  start a topic.
[5152.68 --> 5153.12]  Uh,
[5153.18 --> 5153.94]  okay.
[5154.26 --> 5154.58]  Uh,
[5154.58 --> 5158.18]  let me see what we've got on the dock that we haven't already talked about.
[5158.44 --> 5158.88]  Uh,
[5158.88 --> 5161.48]  Apple may be preparing its own search engine,
[5161.66 --> 5162.28]  uh,
[5162.28 --> 5163.30]  for the past forever.
[5163.30 --> 5170.48]  Google has been paying Apple billions of dollars just for the company to keep Google as the default search engine for every Apple product.
[5170.48 --> 5172.10]  That was a thing that happened with,
[5172.10 --> 5172.68]  uh,
[5172.68 --> 5173.86]  many different companies.
[5173.86 --> 5174.94]  It wasn't just,
[5174.94 --> 5175.64]  uh,
[5176.16 --> 5176.90]  Google to Apple.
[5176.90 --> 5179.72]  It was Google to quite a few other groups in July,
[5179.72 --> 5184.18]  a UK competition and markets authority took a shot at the deal,
[5184.28 --> 5188.90]  claiming that the companies imposed a barrier on market competition in the search engine space.
[5189.26 --> 5189.78]  Uh,
[5189.84 --> 5190.04]  yeah,
[5190.22 --> 5190.86]  uh,
[5190.86 --> 5191.88]  pressure from regulators,
[5192.24 --> 5192.90]  uh,
[5194.10 --> 5197.06]  pressure from regulators like this scenario that I just explained,
[5197.06 --> 5200.00]  as well as Apple's notorious desire for self-reliance.
[5200.00 --> 5203.76]  Maybe giving Apple ideas for launching its own search engine,
[5203.90 --> 5205.12]  which is very interesting.
[5205.56 --> 5205.78]  Uh,
[5205.78 --> 5211.00]  recent changes in spotlight search on iOS 14 and iPad OS 14,
[5211.00 --> 5211.76]  uh,
[5211.76 --> 5213.70]  are bypassing Google altogether.
[5213.70 --> 5219.60]  And new changes made spotlight search go directly to search results rather than going to Google.
[5219.60 --> 5220.10]  Google.
[5220.10 --> 5225.52]  The Apple bought web crawler now renders pages in a similar way to Google and has been,
[5225.52 --> 5225.90]  uh,
[5225.90 --> 5227.56]  updated to rank web pages,
[5227.56 --> 5229.10]  just like a real search engine.
[5229.10 --> 5232.08]  All of this is designed to give Apple enough material.
[5232.08 --> 5234.92]  So it could build something like a search engine,
[5234.92 --> 5239.36]  albeit one embedded in Apple products and not a classical web based one.
[5239.36 --> 5242.54]  Although that's not exactly a difficult thing to pivot to.
[5242.92 --> 5243.22]  Um,
[5243.22 --> 5245.70]  it's pretty easy to make a website with a search bar on it.
[5245.74 --> 5247.92]  So if you have all the features and the backend there,
[5248.08 --> 5248.58]  you can,
[5248.68 --> 5250.90]  you can make that step in a pretty simple way.
[5251.04 --> 5251.30]  Uh,
[5251.30 --> 5257.22]  this also does come after there has been job postings from Apple for search engineers.
[5257.76 --> 5258.12]  Uh,
[5258.12 --> 5259.10]  so yeah,
[5259.10 --> 5261.44]  I think they're very clearly trending in that direction.
[5261.44 --> 5264.44]  We'll have to see if they actually make the full final step,
[5264.58 --> 5265.68]  but yeah.
[5266.68 --> 5267.38]  All right.
[5267.68 --> 5268.12]  And,
[5268.22 --> 5268.66]  uh,
[5268.66 --> 5271.70]  Russian hacking plot targeted Tesla factory.
[5271.82 --> 5272.92]  Do you want to talk us through this one?
[5273.00 --> 5276.02]  I actually was not following this as it was developing.
[5276.16 --> 5277.50]  This looks crazy though.
[5277.80 --> 5279.22]  I didn't follow it that closely,
[5279.22 --> 5280.08]  but it's,
[5280.16 --> 5281.62]  it's kind of nuts.
[5281.90 --> 5282.40]  Um,
[5282.80 --> 5283.02]  it,
[5283.24 --> 5283.32]  there,
[5283.32 --> 5288.06]  there was a Russian speaking immigrant that came to America and has been
[5288.06 --> 5289.24]  working for Tesla.
[5289.74 --> 5290.22]  Um,
[5290.22 --> 5291.56]  and this guy,
[5291.66 --> 5292.86]  I believe his name is there.
[5293.38 --> 5293.78]  Uh,
[5294.04 --> 5294.38]  Ooh,
[5294.38 --> 5295.96]  I'm not going to pronounce that properly.
[5296.60 --> 5297.26]  Come on.
[5297.30 --> 5297.96]  You can try.
[5298.74 --> 5299.22]  Krushkov.
[5300.64 --> 5301.04]  Krush.
[5301.32 --> 5301.52]  No,
[5301.56 --> 5302.74]  that sounds credible enough.
[5302.82 --> 5303.18]  All right.
[5303.32 --> 5304.40]  I have no clue,
[5304.50 --> 5306.38]  but hopefully that's at least somewhat close.
[5306.54 --> 5307.02]  Uh,
[5307.02 --> 5311.44]  said he was vacationing the U S and arranged for himself and the,
[5311.44 --> 5312.02]  uh,
[5312.08 --> 5312.22]  the,
[5312.22 --> 5312.38]  the,
[5312.38 --> 5312.90]  the,
[5312.90 --> 5313.20]  the,
[5313.20 --> 5315.24]  the immigrant person working at Tesla,
[5315.24 --> 5316.00]  uh,
[5316.00 --> 5316.60]  to meet.
[5316.60 --> 5317.82]  And he offered,
[5318.06 --> 5321.24]  I believe it was $500,000 initially,
[5321.24 --> 5321.98]  uh,
[5321.98 --> 5324.92]  for this person to install malware on,
[5324.92 --> 5325.36]  uh,
[5325.36 --> 5330.80]  Tesla's internal network that would feed information out to this Russian based
[5330.80 --> 5331.64]  hacking group.
[5331.64 --> 5332.12]  Wow.
[5332.54 --> 5332.94]  The,
[5333.10 --> 5333.56]  the,
[5333.80 --> 5336.38]  apparently after the first meeting,
[5336.38 --> 5337.92]  the guy reported it to,
[5338.08 --> 5342.38]  I believe Tesla and the FBI and all subsequent meetings were monitored and
[5342.38 --> 5342.80]  recorded,
[5343.02 --> 5343.36]  et cetera.
[5343.52 --> 5344.84]  They were very on top of this,
[5344.92 --> 5345.38]  uh,
[5345.38 --> 5345.92]  including,
[5345.92 --> 5346.76]  uh,
[5346.76 --> 5351.74]  the Tesla employee negotiating his cut up from 500,000 to $1 million.
[5352.24 --> 5353.28]  That's crazy.
[5353.64 --> 5355.84]  Clearly they were expecting some juice.
[5355.84 --> 5357.82]  Can you imagine this employee,
[5357.82 --> 5360.68]  like negotiating for a better cut of a deal?
[5360.68 --> 5362.16]  They know they're not going to get,
[5362.16 --> 5364.94]  I'm sure he's getting something.
[5364.94 --> 5365.96]  Um,
[5365.96 --> 5367.38]  you gotta get something.
[5367.82 --> 5368.20]  Yeah.
[5368.26 --> 5368.82]  Like I'm,
[5368.82 --> 5370.26]  I'm sure Tesla or,
[5370.26 --> 5372.42]  or the FBI or something is going to give him some.
[5372.42 --> 5372.60]  I mean,
[5372.60 --> 5374.32]  what do you think Tesla's deal with him?
[5374.32 --> 5374.68]  It's like,
[5374.74 --> 5375.00]  look,
[5375.04 --> 5377.14]  we'll give you half of whatever you can negotiate,
[5377.14 --> 5378.04]  make it convincing.
[5378.04 --> 5378.30]  Like,
[5378.34 --> 5378.68]  I like,
[5378.74 --> 5380.08]  how does that conversation go?
[5380.08 --> 5383.26]  I have no idea,
[5383.38 --> 5383.92]  but that would be,
[5384.02 --> 5384.74]  that would be amazing.
[5384.90 --> 5385.66]  I would love that.
[5385.66 --> 5386.26]  You get a car.
[5386.50 --> 5387.06]  Oprah style.
[5387.32 --> 5387.74]  Um,
[5388.20 --> 5388.60]  but yeah,
[5388.60 --> 5391.02]  apparently he could face up to five years in prison.
[5391.12 --> 5392.06]  I'm honestly surprised.
[5392.18 --> 5392.56]  It's like,
[5392.56 --> 5393.52]  I'm at that low.
[5393.86 --> 5394.26]  Um,
[5395.12 --> 5395.90]  it's,
[5396.00 --> 5396.36]  it's,
[5396.54 --> 5397.18]  it's interesting.
[5397.32 --> 5398.68]  Apparently it almost got,
[5399.10 --> 5406.08]  or it did sort of get put on pause because they had done a similar scheme to a different company that I don't believe is named.
[5406.08 --> 5409.30]  And that was currently like in full swing.
[5409.30 --> 5412.30]  So they weren't super interested in starting the,
[5412.30 --> 5412.58]  the,
[5412.58 --> 5415.24]  the Tesla project quite yet because they,
[5415.30 --> 5418.34]  they were focused on working on this other one that again,
[5418.34 --> 5419.40]  I don't think was named,
[5419.44 --> 5421.42]  but seemed a little bit more successful.
[5421.66 --> 5422.46]  So yeah,
[5422.46 --> 5422.80]  that's,
[5422.90 --> 5423.52]  that's pretty,
[5423.72 --> 5424.62]  that's pretty crazy.
[5425.76 --> 5426.36]  Wow.
[5427.02 --> 5427.58]  The,
[5427.64 --> 5427.82]  uh,
[5427.82 --> 5429.52]  the Tesla employee was Igor.
[5431.04 --> 5431.58]  Igorovich.
[5431.86 --> 5432.26]  Yeah.
[5435.04 --> 5435.60]  Kuzhkov.
[5435.80 --> 5436.00]  Yeah.
[5436.56 --> 5436.96]  Okay.
[5437.20 --> 5437.52]  Wow.
[5438.32 --> 5438.72]  Kuzhkov,
[5438.84 --> 5439.70]  I think is the,
[5439.70 --> 5440.00]  the,
[5440.02 --> 5441.46]  the guy that came over that tried to,
[5441.46 --> 5441.78]  uh,
[5441.92 --> 5442.64]  push the malware.
[5442.98 --> 5443.18]  Oh,
[5443.26 --> 5443.40]  what?
[5443.52 --> 5443.76]  Sorry.
[5444.92 --> 5445.66]  And then you go.
[5445.84 --> 5446.44]  Oh yeah,
[5446.48 --> 5446.62]  yeah,
[5446.62 --> 5446.74]  yeah.
[5446.76 --> 5446.98]  Yep.
[5447.00 --> 5447.20]  Yep.
[5447.20 --> 5447.50]  You're right.
[5447.56 --> 5449.66]  That was just a bad positioning of a bullet point.
[5450.72 --> 5451.48]  All right.
[5451.74 --> 5455.62]  So I think that's everything we committed to talk through with you guys.
[5455.68 --> 5456.16]  Uh,
[5456.16 --> 5457.52]  thank you for tuning in.
[5457.52 --> 5458.12]  And,
[5458.32 --> 5458.48]  uh,
[5458.48 --> 5462.56]  all that's left now is to get through some of these super chats.
[5463.08 --> 5464.16]  They're super.
[5465.30 --> 5465.74]  Uh,
[5465.74 --> 5467.38]  vague says,
[5467.46 --> 5469.58]  I agree with Epic side of the argument,
[5469.74 --> 5471.44]  but the whole safe fortnight thing was a bit childish.
[5471.62 --> 5471.70]  Well,
[5471.74 --> 5471.86]  yeah,
[5471.86 --> 5472.92]  but look at the users.
[5472.92 --> 5474.12]  They're trying to woo here.
[5474.44 --> 5474.80]  Yes.
[5475.06 --> 5475.78]  Literal children.
[5476.16 --> 5476.54]  Um,
[5476.60 --> 5477.52]  Anthony says,
[5477.52 --> 5478.06]  it's another view.
[5478.14 --> 5478.72]  It's a free market.
[5478.80 --> 5479.88]  Apple created their platform.
[5480.68 --> 5481.08]  Um,
[5481.38 --> 5483.44]  laws need to be updated for Epic to get anything done.
[5483.48 --> 5483.56]  Well,
[5483.56 --> 5483.94]  that's the thing.
[5483.98 --> 5485.06]  The laws do exist.
[5485.18 --> 5488.92]  Epic's just arguing that they are being violated right now.
[5490.38 --> 5490.94]  Hamza says,
[5490.94 --> 5492.68]  how do payments work on the iOS float plane app.
[5492.76 --> 5493.60]  Now they don't,
[5493.60 --> 5493.92]  uh,
[5493.92 --> 5497.40]  you have to pay through the website and then you just sign in using the,
[5497.56 --> 5498.16]  using the app.
[5498.64 --> 5499.74]  And that's going to be very confusing.
[5499.74 --> 5502.30]  Cause that is definitely one of the rules is,
[5502.52 --> 5502.88]  uh,
[5502.98 --> 5505.76]  we aren't able to tell you why anything doesn't work.
[5506.10 --> 5506.36]  Yeah.
[5507.04 --> 5509.58]  But that's actually the same as Netflix and stuff.
[5509.64 --> 5512.08]  So I don't think it's going to be that confusing to people.
[5512.38 --> 5512.74]  Yeah.
[5512.80 --> 5513.06]  Hopefully,
[5513.12 --> 5515.20]  hopefully iOS users are getting used to it at this point.
[5515.28 --> 5517.22]  It's kind of how quite a few different services work.
[5517.90 --> 5519.10]  Who would win in a fight?
[5519.16 --> 5520.58]  Asks that guy eating cake.
[5520.80 --> 5523.04]  You and me versus Paul and Kyle.
[5526.72 --> 5527.08]  I,
[5527.18 --> 5529.38]  am I going to sound too,
[5529.44 --> 5530.84]  I think we'd win like.
[5531.22 --> 5531.62]  Oh,
[5531.70 --> 5532.16]  a hundred percent.
[5532.64 --> 5533.04]  Yeah.
[5533.20 --> 5533.84]  A hundred percent.
[5533.94 --> 5534.66]  Not even close.
[5534.76 --> 5535.92]  No offense to Paul and Kyle,
[5535.92 --> 5536.58]  but like,
[5536.58 --> 5537.86]  get real.
[5542.08 --> 5542.56]  Um,
[5542.70 --> 5543.56]  oh man,
[5543.72 --> 5544.36]  I feel bad.
[5544.72 --> 5545.12]  Um,
[5545.22 --> 5546.98]  sorry.
[5547.26 --> 5547.60]  I just,
[5547.96 --> 5548.26]  yeah,
[5548.26 --> 5548.92]  I feel like,
[5549.06 --> 5550.38]  I feel like a real monster.
[5550.76 --> 5551.78]  I wouldn't want to,
[5551.86 --> 5552.88]  I'll say that much.
[5554.02 --> 5554.50]  Um,
[5554.76 --> 5555.76]  but I still would.
[5556.36 --> 5556.84]  Yeah.
[5558.36 --> 5558.96]  All right.
[5558.98 --> 5560.38]  What else we got here?
[5562.20 --> 5563.00]  Aging airplanes.
[5563.00 --> 5563.84]  I'd have some,
[5563.94 --> 5564.32]  some,
[5564.40 --> 5564.82]  uh,
[5564.82 --> 5565.18]  some,
[5565.18 --> 5567.36]  some feeling behind my punches when I'm like,
[5567.46 --> 5567.80]  Paul,
[5567.92 --> 5570.12]  why are you still not on the flow plane?
[5571.24 --> 5572.44]  Join the service.
[5572.56 --> 5572.68]  Yeah.
[5572.78 --> 5573.00]  Paul.
[5573.34 --> 5573.74]  Good.
[5574.18 --> 5575.54]  You could make more money.
[5575.96 --> 5576.28]  Aging.
[5576.34 --> 5577.64]  Thank you.
[5577.78 --> 5578.14]  Oh yeah.
[5578.14 --> 5578.88]  I've got another,
[5579.02 --> 5579.32]  uh,
[5579.32 --> 5581.16]  I've got another teaser for the upcoming,
[5581.28 --> 5582.30]  how does LMG make money?
[5582.30 --> 5582.86]  So,
[5582.86 --> 5583.30]  uh,
[5583.30 --> 5586.78]  6% from flow plane.
[5588.38 --> 5589.26]  It's a big chunk.
[5589.66 --> 5590.50]  It's a big chunk.
[5590.56 --> 5591.40]  It makes a big difference.
[5591.62 --> 5593.32]  Massive shout out to the flow plane peeps.
[5594.32 --> 5594.76]  Uh,
[5594.94 --> 5597.14]  you guys don't even really push it that much.
[5597.26 --> 5597.62]  No,
[5597.86 --> 5598.16]  no,
[5598.24 --> 5598.62]  honestly,
[5598.62 --> 5600.80]  it's just the people that really want to support us.
[5601.10 --> 5602.78]  It's really appreciate it.
[5604.00 --> 5604.44]  Uh,
[5604.50 --> 5605.04]  what's,
[5605.12 --> 5605.26]  uh,
[5605.26 --> 5605.76]  where'd it go?
[5605.90 --> 5606.56]  Do you have anything else?
[5606.56 --> 5608.42]  I just only have three eggs.
[5608.84 --> 5609.28]  Um,
[5610.14 --> 5610.48]  oh yeah.
[5610.56 --> 5611.54]  Aging airplanes asks,
[5611.66 --> 5614.32]  does AMD's open CL stand a chance against CUDA?
[5615.20 --> 5615.64]  Um,
[5616.62 --> 5617.10]  honestly,
[5617.20 --> 5617.96]  at this point,
[5617.96 --> 5623.44]  I don't really see how open CL does stand a chance against CUDA.
[5623.62 --> 5625.90]  NVIDIA has done a very good job,
[5625.90 --> 5627.56]  not just of introducing the technology,
[5627.72 --> 5630.32]  but supporting it with software developers.
[5630.92 --> 5631.02]  Um,
[5632.40 --> 5635.36]  we're an all NVIDIA shop when it comes to our workstations.
[5635.60 --> 5636.22]  Like there's just,
[5636.22 --> 5637.78]  there is no question.
[5638.04 --> 5640.90]  There's no option of going AMD from a,
[5640.96 --> 5642.06]  from a workstation standpoint.
[5642.24 --> 5645.64]  Literally the only workstations on earth that I'm aware of that actually
[5645.64 --> 5648.88]  unironically use AMD are Apple ones.
[5648.88 --> 5652.12]  And that's just because they are way too salty at NVIDIA.
[5652.90 --> 5653.38]  Um,
[5653.96 --> 5655.54]  not saying they're entirely unjustified,
[5655.54 --> 5656.16]  just to be clear.
[5657.28 --> 5657.76]  Uh,
[5657.86 --> 5662.16]  aging airplane says also LTT's IPO would be a disaster.
[5662.94 --> 5663.42]  Uh,
[5663.48 --> 5663.72]  well,
[5663.80 --> 5664.06]  yeah,
[5664.06 --> 5666.22]  yeah,
[5666.28 --> 5666.56]  it would,
[5666.82 --> 5667.04]  I,
[5667.18 --> 5668.12]  I wouldn't do it.
[5668.18 --> 5668.64]  It would suck.
[5671.00 --> 5675.08]  I'd be far more likely to consider like some kind of like private,
[5675.30 --> 5676.42]  private equity,
[5676.66 --> 5676.94]  like,
[5677.08 --> 5678.54]  like ownership with the community.
[5678.54 --> 5684.66]  The problem is that we'd have to do a lot of the same work as if we were just publicly listed.
[5684.66 --> 5685.16]  And I just,
[5685.26 --> 5685.88]  I can't be arsed.
[5685.96 --> 5687.68]  I like being able to make my own decisions.
[5688.20 --> 5688.60]  Yeah.
[5688.64 --> 5689.90]  I don't think you'd ever do it.
[5689.90 --> 5691.50]  Even if it wasn't even that difficult.
[5691.96 --> 5692.98]  Kinestic says,
[5693.04 --> 5693.20]  uh,
[5693.20 --> 5695.96]  any update on different colored shirt fabrics for LTT shirts?
[5696.70 --> 5697.10]  No,
[5697.48 --> 5699.18]  unfortunately.
[5699.92 --> 5701.26]  Every week for a bit now.
[5701.36 --> 5701.76]  Yeah.
[5702.04 --> 5703.82]  The bad news is that we got them in.
[5703.88 --> 5705.28]  They didn't meet the quality standards.
[5705.28 --> 5706.00]  So we're,
[5706.22 --> 5708.36]  we're going back to the drawing board a little bit.
[5708.46 --> 5708.62]  I,
[5708.66 --> 5710.14]  I have no idea when we're going to get there.
[5710.82 --> 5711.52]  All right.
[5711.62 --> 5713.50]  So that's it for the WAN show.
[5713.70 --> 5714.86]  Thank you for tuning in.
[5714.98 --> 5715.86]  We'll see you again next week.
[5716.34 --> 5717.30]  Same bad time.
[5717.78 --> 5719.08]  Same bad channel.
[5719.08 --> 5719.68]  Oh,

[5724.90 --> 5725.24]  The,
[5725.24 --> 5725.54]  the,
[5725.54 --> 5734.78]  should we raid someone is like plenty time streaming or like,
[5734.78 --> 5735.34]  uh,
[5735.50 --> 5736.60]  wifey sauce or like,
[5736.64 --> 5736.90]  is anyone,
[5737.08 --> 5737.84]  is anyone cool?
[5738.08 --> 5739.16]  I think streaming.
[5739.32 --> 5742.26]  I think plenty time is actually having a nap.
[5742.76 --> 5743.24]  Um,
[5743.26 --> 5744.04]  I was having a little,
[5744.12 --> 5744.66]  little sleep,
[5744.74 --> 5744.96]  little,
[5744.96 --> 5746.06]  little rest there.
[5746.74 --> 5749.06]  UFD tech is live on YouTube.
[5749.08 --> 5751.10]  doing a 24 hour charity stream.
[5751.10 --> 5752.04]  He has 75,
[5752.38 --> 5755.04]  $7,500 worth of giveaways.
[5755.50 --> 5755.82]  Ooh.
[5756.52 --> 5757.04]  All right.
[5757.54 --> 5757.94]  If.
[5761.38 --> 5761.82]  Sure.
[5762.06 --> 5763.24]  If he's on Twitch as well,
[5763.46 --> 5765.02]  if he's live on Twitch as well,
[5765.18 --> 5767.58]  because that would be an easier place to raid.
[5767.66 --> 5768.26]  Cause yes,
[5768.26 --> 5769.36]  he's live on Twitch as well.
[5769.42 --> 5772.02]  So you could like do the actual raid thing.
[5772.70 --> 5773.18]  All right.
