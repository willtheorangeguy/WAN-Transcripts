I'll bet you anything I was on the pseudo-science list for a minute.  My mother is a particularly fond of conspiracy theories such as chem-trails, inside-job 9-11, fake moon landing, and more I'm sure I don't know.  I've looked up the same content both genuinely as a younger individual, and passive amusement while washing dishes or cooking more recently.
It all comes down to the individual though, and their ability to weed out the BS from reality.  You definitely can't blame the way someone was raised if my case is worth anything.   Further, I literally jumped between schools every couple years, one district in a rich county, and one that wasn't up to the same standards, so unless that gave me a heightened ability to discern quality of information, schooling variable = null.
I wasn't looking at the chat, but you shouted out someone that said something along the lines of "FFS, pseudo-science is the science that has been proven but isn't accepted yet."  That person is one of the individuals that believes they are on another level.  They truly believe those errant "facts" and think the rest of society is blind.
I scrolled back through and found the timestamp, I hope someone actually reads this, lol.  32:00 it took me several minutes to find that spot.
I honestly think that it comes down to what a person values.  Does that person value the latest news on Kim Cardashian, or are they actively seeking to gain knowledge of science?

Oh bummer I thought 6GHz(in the timestamps) was about CPU frequency :'(
