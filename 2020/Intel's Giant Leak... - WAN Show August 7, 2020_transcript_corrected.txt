[0.00 → 4.64] Are we definitely live on YouTube? We're definitely live on YouTube. Okay, cool. All right.
[5.18 → 12.14] Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen. We've got a fantastic show lined up for you today.
[12.72 → 19.12] Luke is going to be airing some of his grievances with Apple over the deployment of the float plane
[19.12 → 25.26] iOS app. We're going to have to be real careful. I don't think we can say specifically word for
[25.26 → 32.06] what's in these emails or like what? Yeah, so we'll have to dance it around a little bit,
[32.34 → 39.28] but I guarantee you hilarity will ensue. Intel suffered a massive data leak. You know,
[39.36 → 43.66] I can't believe we haven't talked about the Nintendo leak on WAN show. Surely you've been
[43.66 → 48.92] following that as well, right? I haven't been following it as closely. Did you see Weird Joshi?
[50.02 → 55.02] Yes. Did you see the Luigi assets, the like bizarre Luigi assets in Mario 64?
[56.22 → 61.02] It's all been incredible. There's a fair amount of funky things from that leak. Anyway,
[61.34 → 69.02] there's supposedly a 20 gigabyte Intel mega leak with the leaker saying more to come. What else we got
[69.02 → 76.54] today, Luke? TikTok and WeChat are going to be banned from doing business with US companies in 45 days.
[76.54 → 85.50] Wow. Where did this come from? Didn't see this before. Get unpacked with Samsung happened and there's
[85.50 → 90.78] lots that was announced. This will probably take a little bit to go through. Tons of different devices.
[91.02 → 96.08] I'm sure we'll talk about that later. Oh, we sure will, but not until after we have rolled the intro.
[96.08 → 97.04] Oh, yes.
[97.04 → 101.04] Oh, yes.
[101.04 → 124.32] Oh, shoot. The intro's done rolling. I was like trying to figure out how to turn slow mode on in the chat.
[124.32 → 135.20] All right. Why don't we jump right into my favourite topic for the day, which is the saga that has been
[135.92 → 142.08] getting the float plane app up on iOS? So here, I want to provide a little bit of background first.
[142.08 → 152.16] The reason we're talking about this is not because, you know, float plane is obviously Luke's full-time job and a significant source of revenue for Linus Media Group.
[153.44 → 160.64] The reason that we're talking about this now is that it happens to be very topical at the moment.
[160.64 → 171.28] So Apple is under fire from a number of directions right now, including the EU, the US government, app developers.
[171.28 → 173.44] Sorry, what's that email app called? Hello?
[174.56 → 175.52] I think so.
[175.52 → 182.00] I think it's called Hello. You guys can correct me if I'm wrong. There's like an alternative email app that's really upset with them.
[182.96 → 184.40] Who else is mad? Oh, yeah.
[184.40 → 190.88] Just today, it was confirmed that Microsoft's project cloud will not be available on iOS.
[190.88 → 197.92] And now Apple's justification for their behaviour comes from a couple places.
[197.92 → 205.92] So one is that they do not allow alternate payment methods to be embedded within apps.
[206.56 → 209.68] So, Luke, do you want to what's what's the exact wording for that?
[209.68 → 214.72] I can look it up, but I thought we were sticking away from the exact wording.
[214.72 → 216.16] Sure. Okay. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
[216.16 → 222.96] But they talk about the in-app payment API, and they're referring to their own when they save it.
[222.96 → 231.20] And the reason that they want app developers to use their own is, of course, purely for the safety of their users and to...
[231.20 → 233.44] And the general user experience.
[233.44 → 242.40] The general user experience and to save developers the work of creating their own, you know, payment processing system,
[242.40 → 248.96] which most of them would probably have anyway because they probably also have a website that you can go to on the internet.
[249.76 → 252.24] But Apple doesn't want you to have to worry about any of that.
[252.24 → 261.28] They want you to only use the Apple API, which coincidentally, Apple happens to glean 30% of the revenue, the top line revenue off of.
[261.28 → 264.08] So that but that has nothing to do with the motivation.
[264.08 → 267.76] It's everything to do with creating a great user experience.
[267.76 → 268.24] Wow.
[268.24 → 274.48] The other thing that they are really upset about is Project cloud.
[274.48 → 277.20] Well, here's the thing, Microsoft with Project cloud.
[278.72 → 285.20] We would really have to validate all of those games like individually as their own individual apps.
[285.20 → 291.60] And I'm afraid that's just, you know, that's not a, I don't know, good user experience, something, something.
[291.60 → 295.68] Apple Arcade subscription is probably the way people should game.
[295.68 → 297.92] We would actually rather you use our service.
[297.92 → 298.64] Thanks, K-Bye.
[299.36 → 299.76] Yeah.
[299.76 → 309.20] So basically the investigations that they're under right now are focused on whether Apple is abusing its position as...
[309.20 → 314.88] as maybe not a monopoly, but certainly a...
[316.16 → 316.96] I don't know.
[316.96 → 318.56] Could we call it a duopoly?
[319.28 → 320.32] Oligopoly?
[320.32 → 320.96] You know, whatever.
[320.96 → 327.28] Like they're one of the few sort of app store owners at this point.
[327.28 → 330.64] And at least for the North American audience, I believe they're over 50%.
[330.64 → 340.32] And they, it is monopolistic in the sense that if you are using an Apple device, which you could very well be using without fully understanding that
[341.28 → 347.92] developer, app developers and service providers are not able to provide you their service in the way that they would like to.
[351.04 → 358.08] They're behaving in a monopolistic way in the sense that you could easily have this device that you as a consumer think that you can just do whatever you want with.
[358.08 → 366.96] But actually you can't because of policies that they have put in place that are not really apparent to the users that can actually harm the user experience.
[366.96 → 379.60] So, um, some of the things that the float plane app has gone through over the last, well, months, uh, I mean, in no particular order, Luke, do you want to, do you want to hit me with some of the things that you guys have had to change and or remove?
[380.56 → 384.16] Um, user generated content as a whole is...
[384.16 → 384.72] Okay, hold on.
[384.72 → 385.60] Let's start with that.
[385.60 → 387.04] You can't subscribe, right?
[387.04 → 388.08] Oh yeah.
[388.08 → 388.16] Okay.
[388.16 → 393.52] So we, we can't do the whole 30% cut thing.
[393.52 → 405.44] I think that's only ever going to make any amount of sense for like little games where you buy coins from them or something like, like the thing that you're delivering to the user has no real value.
[405.44 → 408.24] Sorry to any mobile gamers out there that kind of offended.
[408.24 → 408.64] Wow.
[408.64 → 409.68] But sick burn.
[409.68 → 410.48] It's just, wow.
[410.48 → 411.28] It's just digital coins.
[411.28 → 412.64] When's your apology video?
[412.64 → 414.24] When's your apology video coming?
[414.24 → 414.80] Yeah.
[414.80 → 418.72] Like it, it, it has perceived value, but you're not, you're not passing forward.
[418.72 → 419.52] Like, yeah.
[419.52 → 432.72] Anyway, for, for us, we, there's, there's, we have to pay, well, I guess those gaming companies pay for servers, but it's not exactly on the same level as delivering large amounts of high quality content video.
[432.72 → 432.88] Yeah.
[432.88 → 444.08] Um, but we, we, we have that to maintain, and we have to be, give a very large cuts to creators because that's the whole point of the platform is making money for creators.
[444.08 → 445.84] That is literally the whole point.
[445.84 → 449.76] Um, so thanks that, that 30% cut thing.
[449.76 → 450.80] No worries.
[450.80 → 454.72] That 30% cut thing just doesn't, it doesn't math out.
[454.72 → 455.68] It doesn't make any sense.
[455.68 → 456.88] We, we can't do it.
[456.88 → 458.24] It's not an option.
[458.24 → 460.48] Like it just, it doesn't fit in the pie.
[460.48 → 461.04] Yeah.
[461.04 → 462.64] Um, so we, we can't do it.
[462.64 → 468.64] So going forward, we can't have, uh, payment stuff on Google.
[468.64 → 469.60] They don't really care.
[469.60 → 470.24] Yeah.
[470.24 → 471.28] On the play store.
[471.28 → 472.48] They didn't even check.
[472.48 → 475.52] They're happy to take, they're happy to take their 30% cut.
[475.52 → 475.92] Oh yeah.
[475.92 → 484.24] If you use their payment API, but they're also happy to let you, you know, redirect the user to an outside website.
[484.24 → 495.60] So that was the next thing we had to remove was any reference to where you could go outside the app to, uh, fire up a subscription, enter some payment information.
[495.60 → 496.48] Any reference at all.
[496.48 → 499.68] Including support, FAQ, anything.
[500.24 → 504.64] Any, any link or reference to the main website had to be completely removed.
[504.64 → 506.32] So you're not allowed to subscribe.
[506.32 → 512.24] You're not allowed to, uh, get off boarded in any reasonable way, even for completely unrelated things.
[512.24 → 512.40] Yeah.
[512.40 → 513.36] You can't cancel a subscription.
[513.36 → 514.72] You are not even allowed to.
[514.72 → 514.96] Yeah.
[514.96 → 516.80] You can't manage your payments whatsoever.
[516.80 → 519.76] Like we would love to make it easy to cancel the subscription.
[519.76 → 523.36] That's a very, that's a very consumer friendly practice.
[523.36 → 533.76] But Apple in the interest of preserving the, the user experience would like us to make sure that there's absolutely no way within the iOS app to unsubscribe from float plane.
[533.76 → 538.16] You should also have no way to discover additional content.
[538.16 → 546.96] So if you are subscribed at a creator below a tier that is allowed to see certain things, you can never see that there are things that you are unable to see.
[546.96 → 549.12] You are also completely unable.
[549.12 → 552.64] Uh, you are also completely unable to discover any other creators.
[552.64 → 554.24] So you can't search for other creators.
[554.24 → 556.32] You can't see what are the creators on the platform.
[556.32 → 557.76] You can't do anything like that.
[557.76 → 570.32] No, like we're already a non discoverability platform, but like on top of that, even if you knew exactly who you were looking for, you would be completely unable to find them through the app because there is no mechanism.
[570.32 → 576.80] Hey, Luke, at least I can leave a comment under the video and talk with the rest of the talk with the rest of the community.
[576.80 → 577.36] Wrong.
[577.36 → 578.08] About, about.
[579.52 → 583.12] User generated content is apparently terrifying.
[583.12 → 591.84] There is no user generated content allowed, no avatars, no names, no comments that might be able to be rectified.
[591.84 → 603.12] If we are somehow able to discover what exactly they want us to do in order to cover any potential for objectionable content on the platform.
[603.12 → 603.76] This is great.
[603.76 → 605.84] They don't seem to have a definition for it.
[605.84 → 609.84] Luke, you're obviously an idiot because one Owen Morley.
[609.84 → 610.48] Okay.
[610.48 → 614.88] One Owen Morley says, what amateur did you get to make the iOS app?
[614.88 → 618.56] These are very basic things that any Apple developer that has submitted an app before would know.
[619.20 → 619.76] Wow.
[619.76 → 620.64] Sick burn.
[620.64 → 620.96] Okay.
[620.96 → 627.20] Except for we've got some, we've got some, some other, some other, you know, fun, fun things to share with you.
[627.20 → 633.52] So, um, one of the ways that, okay, so for example, let's talk about the user generated comment, uh, content.
[633.52 → 639.76] So comments, uh, you know, as, as a way of arguing our case, we pointed out that apps like.
[640.40 → 645.44] YouTube and Twitch have comments on them.
[646.24 → 647.44] And the response was what?
[647.44 → 648.48] And Twitch comments like?
[648.48 → 653.52] The response was, hold on, Luke, hold on, Luke, because Apple has some very legitimate concerns here.
[654.24 → 659.60] They are concerned that we might not have the capabilities to properly moderate those comments.
[659.60 → 662.48] But given how well, and you know what?
[662.48 → 670.08] I get it because given how well the comments on the Twitch app are moderated and how family friendly and in offence of those comments are.
[670.08 → 675.76] I think it's fair to say that Apple is holding absolutely everyone to identical standards.
[676.40 → 683.36] As we have also, speaking of identical standards, we have also done market research on other similar apps.
[683.36 → 691.04] There's a whole range of other apps that are in a similar situation because who the heck would want to have a 30% cut being taken by Apple.
[691.04 → 699.68] So there are a lot of subscription style apps for a variety of things that you can't subscribe through the, uh, Apple app.
[699.68 → 702.72] You also can't view any of the content that you don't have access to.
[702.72 → 703.12] Yeah.
[703.12 → 708.40] Uh, in order to potentially subscribe, there's no off-boarding, but all that kind of stuff we have like.
[710.56 → 717.04] Tried to follow the template that those apps have set to the closest T we possibly could.
[717.92 → 720.00] And we've just been rejected.
[720.00 → 722.64] And I have more or less asked like, okay,
[724.72 → 728.96] what else do you need me to do other than exactly what you have approved for other people?
[728.96 → 731.12] And they've just more or less told me to get lost.
[731.12 → 731.76] Yeah.
[731.76 → 732.16] Yeah.
[732.16 → 732.80] Yeah.
[732.80 → 733.92] Which was super NATO.
[735.28 → 742.00] So yeah, we are going to continue cutting down and worsening the user experience for iOS users.
[742.72 → 746.24] And trying to apparently make it as terrible of an app as possible.
[746.24 → 751.28] And maybe eventually, uh, they will decide that our app is bad enough for their platform.
[751.92 → 752.24] Yes.
[752.24 → 756.88] Uh, a bad enough, bad enough user experience for, for Apple.
[756.88 → 757.52] You're welcome.
[757.52 → 759.04] You're welcome iOS users.
[759.52 → 760.64] Um, you know, we're really,
[760.64 → 761.52] we're really doing our best.
[761.52 → 767.28] The crazy thing is like the iOS app, a lot of development went into like having features work,
[767.92 → 769.12] which we thought was cool.
[770.16 → 772.72] Um, oh, well.
[772.72 → 779.20] It was good for the like one update cycle that it was on par with, uh, the Google Play Store.
[779.20 → 780.40] But it was pretty good.
[780.40 → 780.96] Yeah.
[780.96 → 782.88] And they were like, wait, no, what's happening?
[782.88 → 783.92] No crush.
[783.92 → 784.40] Yeah.
[784.40 → 785.20] It was bad.
[785.20 → 786.48] We don't want this to be this good.
[787.36 → 787.76] All right.
[787.76 → 789.68] Speaking of things that are not too good.
[789.68 → 794.08] Uh, 20 gigs of Intel intellectual property.
[794.64 → 795.28] Have leaked.
[795.28 → 795.84] Uh, yes.
[795.84 → 805.76] So it consultant Tilly Cotman tweeted a link to a file sharing service that contains what an anonymous source claims is a portion of Intel's crown jewels.
[805.76 → 809.60] 20 gigs of confidential Intel intellectual property.
[809.60 → 811.60] Say that six times fast.
[811.60 → 812.80] The leak was published.
[812.80 → 814.40] To counter that really quick.
[814.40 → 828.32] I will say that an Intel spokesperson has said that they were not hacked, but the data looks to be from an Intel resource and design centre that hosts non-public technical information for partners and customers integrating Intel tech into their products.
[828.32 → 828.72] So.
[828.72 → 830.32] So it was published.
[830.32 → 830.72] Either way.
[830.72 → 836.80] It was published via Twitter, uh, via telegram and Twitter with a link to the data on a file sharing, on file sharing site mega.
[836.80 → 838.08] And there's a lot of data.
[838.64 → 842.72] So there's KB Lake training videos, which are apparently very cringe.
[842.72 → 845.20] Uh, I personally look forward to watching those.
[845.20 → 847.44] I would get a real kick out of that.
[847.44 → 854.88] Various schematics, Intel marketing materials templates, uh, binaries for camera drivers that Intel made for SpaceX, apparently.
[855.60 → 856.88] So that's interesting.
[856.88 → 859.76] Roadmaps, various Intel development and debugging tools.
[859.76 → 865.36] And it basically just goes on and on and on.
[865.36 → 872.00] Uh, Tilly Cotman says you should definitely search for back door in the firmware sources, though.
[872.00 → 877.20] I don't know that any of that has actually been followed up by others yet.
[877.20 → 878.80] Uh, this is a funny one, though.
[878.80 → 888.48] If you find password-protected zips in the release, the password is probably either Intel 123 or Intel 123 with or without a capital I.
[888.48 → 890.88] This was not set by me or my source.
[890.88 → 893.28] This is how it was acquired from Intel.
[893.28 → 895.60] So, womp.
[895.60 → 903.92] To be fair, they don't seem like with those password-protected zips, they seem like they are designed to be handed outside the company.
[903.92 → 904.32] Yes.
[904.32 → 907.60] Probably not exactly like super high security zip files.
[907.60 → 916.80] So, uh, basically what it looks like is this was information that was under NDA or Intel restricted secret protection.
[916.80 → 926.24] And apparently the information was sourced by scanning the internet with Map and finding an unsecured Akamai CDN server hosting Intel's files.
[926.24 → 934.00] Ah, so here's something that I would love to know.
[935.36 → 940.56] Why would, why would they put all this stuff on, on there?
[940.56 → 942.88] Um.
[942.88 → 947.20] Like, why would you leave it publicly available on the internet?
[947.20 → 949.20] Like on a CDN?
[949.20 → 952.08] Yeah, I was, I was just going to define Akamai as a CDN.
[952.08 → 954.40] I, that I really, yeah.
[954.40 → 965.92] Yeah, this, this feels like something that you'd have on, uh, potentially like a partner access website that would have specific accounts for those partners so they could access that information.
[965.92 → 973.84] Um, if that website was, uh, uh, if, if the content delivery for that website was handled by Akamai.
[974.48 → 974.88] Yeah.
[974.88 → 978.56] Which seems, seems pretty like necessary, but unnecessary.
[978.56 → 978.96] But likely.
[979.52 → 979.84] Yeah.
[980.16 → 988.08] It's, it's, it's very possible because that's what they do, but unnecessary because like, it's not really even that much data.
[988.88 → 992.48] And like how many of these different pieces of data, like we're going through.
[993.28 → 999.44] A bunch of this very schematics Intel marketing templates, uh, binaries for camera drivers.
[999.44 → 1009.20] Like most of these users are probably if this theoretical website exists, most of these users are probably, uh, confined down to certain things.
[1009.20 → 1009.76] Yeah.
[1009.76 → 1014.40] They're probably given like user access to, to different levels of different things.
[1014.40 → 1014.64] Right.
[1014.64 → 1021.44] Um, so like, I can't imagine there's really that much access going on here, but.
[1021.44 → 1030.32] But the, the, the weird one to me is that given that very little of this looks to be like rich media, like video, um, like really heavy media.
[1030.32 → 1043.12] Like I, I know from experience that Intel has obviously plenty of hardware at their disposal and, you know, like server rooms and high speed internet connections at their campuses.
[1043.12 → 1051.68] Like this seems like the kind of thing that so few people would need access to at once that there's no reason that you have to throw it up on like.
[1053.04 → 1055.20] A server hosted by Akamai, right?
[1055.60 → 1065.92] Like, why wouldn't they just, I mean, obviously they'd want something a little bit more sophisticated than, you know, an FTP server with SSL encryption or whatever.
[1065.92 → 1071.92] But like, why wouldn't they just host this themselves so that they can handle all the authentication.
[1071.92 → 1080.80] The funny thing about it is in our dealings with Intel, like we access their, um, like their payments portal and stuff, for example, because they're a long time sponsor of ours.
[1082.00 → 1084.64] And like all of that, you know, seems.
[1084.64 → 1094.54] Um, it seems pretty well put together, you know, so I don't know.
[1094.60 → 1103.54] This is the kind of data that's like secret enough that you don't want a dump of it on the internet, but maybe not secret enough that you treat it like, you know, financial information.
[1103.54 → 1105.36] So maybe it just kind of slipped through the cracks.
[1105.36 → 1119.30] Yeah, it, it was probably a mistake at some level, but it seems like, I don't know, honestly, Intel's response of like, yeah, we weren't hacked.
[1119.30 → 1122.64] It was from this like resource and design centre.
[1122.78 → 1126.10] Like they're probably pissed off internally.
[1126.30 → 1133.20] Someone's probably getting a bit of a rough talking to, but like, I don't think this is going to be a super major deal moving forward.
[1133.20 → 1137.12] I, I'm pretty interested in the training videos.
[1137.42 → 1138.24] Me too.
[1138.36 → 1139.52] I'm so excited.
[1140.24 → 1150.66] It was something that could, I can, I always come with these harebrained ideas, and they're probably terrible, but it would be hilarious to get some of the more like, I don't know.
[1150.72 → 1157.40] I can think of a lot of people at Linus Media Group that I think would do good at this, but like make effectively copies of them.
[1157.76 → 1159.20] Oh, do you like parodies?
[1159.64 → 1159.98] Yeah.
[1160.24 → 1160.58] Yeah.
[1160.58 → 1164.26] Until KB Lake training video parody.
[1164.48 → 1165.98] I would find that hilarious.
[1166.34 → 1167.62] I don't know how many people would, but.
[1167.80 → 1168.04] Yeah.
[1168.18 → 1171.80] You, all dozens of you would have a perfect time watching that video.
[1172.50 → 1173.58] Real good time.
[1174.96 → 1176.42] Ace, ace enjoyment.
[1178.34 → 1179.10] Oh man.
[1179.14 → 1183.44] It's just, it's just kind of embarrassing, but I mean, it goes to show it can kind of happen to anyone.
[1183.44 → 1184.28] Yeah.
[1184.28 → 1192.56] As I alluded to earlier in the show, I have been following with, with avid interest, all the things that have been coming out of the Nintendo.
[1192.68 → 1193.30] What are they calling it?
[1193.34 → 1194.06] The Gig leak?
[1194.62 → 1195.16] Gig leak.
[1195.24 → 1196.04] I think that's correct.
[1196.16 → 1196.38] Yeah.
[1196.92 → 1197.36] Man.
[1197.42 → 1199.96] It's just been absolutely amazing.
[1199.96 → 1203.96] You should bring up a weird Joshi on the stream.
[1204.08 → 1207.58] Cause that, that one's like, that one's real odd.
[1207.72 → 1208.60] It's so weird.
[1208.60 → 1218.10] And the funny thing is like the only reason that, that, you know, normal Joshi looks normal to me and weird Joshi looks, so weird is that.
[1218.62 → 1221.20] Well, normal Joshi is what we ended up with.
[1221.30 → 1221.66] Well, okay.
[1221.70 → 1223.16] Weird Joshi does look pretty weird.
[1223.28 → 1224.68] Weird Joshi is pretty weird.
[1224.82 → 1227.08] I think it would look weird regardless.
[1227.36 → 1229.68] Why can I not find any images of this?
[1230.02 → 1230.74] Oh, here it is.
[1230.78 → 1231.04] Okay.
[1231.10 → 1231.92] Weird beta Joshi.
[1232.04 → 1232.58] Hold on a second.
[1232.66 → 1234.28] Let me just get my display up here.
[1234.28 → 1240.06] I think if weird Joshi was, was like the legitimate Joshi that made it.
[1240.20 → 1240.62] Okay.
[1241.90 → 1249.14] There's some, there's some weird stuff in here that's sort of unrelated to weird Joshi, but this is, this is the one we're focused on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1249.14 → 1263.48] So this, uh, this sprite, like this asset is actually in the leaked documents and looks like it was an earlier design for the rideable dinosaur for Mario in Super Mario World,
[1263.48 → 1270.36] which was, um, if you're not familiar, the like console selling launch title of the Super Nintendo.
[1271.08 → 1274.00] Um, yeah, it really doesn't look great.
[1274.06 → 1281.06] Have you seen the have you seen the photoshops of Super Mario Brothers 3 Mario on top of weird Joshi?
[1281.06 → 1283.46] No, actually.
[1284.88 → 1285.82] Oh, no.
[1285.82 → 1294.80] I think something with weird Joshi too is it's not as timeless as most of the assets that came out around that time.
[1295.88 → 1301.12] Like weird Joshi would legitimately be a very odd character in modern times.
[1301.88 → 1303.06] Yeah, that's true.
[1303.06 → 1308.12] Other stuff kind of translated relatively well, which is why I think it's like legitimately really weird.
[1308.80 → 1309.48] All right.
[1309.52 → 1311.46] Here's a slightly better look.
[1311.56 → 1313.68] So here's little Mario riding weird Joshi.
[1313.78 → 1315.50] That's not the one I was looking for though.
[1316.40 → 1321.12] Um, there's so much fan art of weird Joshi.
[1322.50 → 1324.68] And it's like, it's all great.
[1324.86 → 1327.32] I absolutely love all of it.
[1327.32 → 1330.00] Yeah, look at this.
[1330.12 → 1331.38] Super Mario World beta.
[1334.88 → 1336.16] Oh, it's awful.
[1336.64 → 1337.46] Uh, yeah.
[1337.80 → 1338.22] Okay.
[1338.34 → 1338.72] All right.
[1338.80 → 1339.14] Enough.
[1339.54 → 1340.90] Enough beta Joshi here.
[1341.04 → 1342.08] I will put it away.
[1342.22 → 1342.82] I'll put it away.
[1343.18 → 1354.32] Um, but man, the, the amount of data in these, there's like source code for games, unused enemies, um, unused characters, uh, like little internal tools.
[1354.32 → 1358.78] I saw an amazing tweet from a developer that was like, I haven't seen this tool in 25 years.
[1358.78 → 1361.22] I'm like, wow, that's crazy.
[1361.66 → 1362.88] Like, that's crazy.
[1363.74 → 1368.32] Like I wrote this to like, you know, solve some weird workaround problem.
[1369.12 → 1371.36] Like I never thought I would see it again.
[1372.60 → 1373.56] So bizarre.
[1374.98 → 1378.32] There's even like, like Zelda 64.
[1381.64 → 1382.04] What?
[1382.76 → 1383.10] Sorry.
[1383.20 → 1383.38] What?
[1383.46 → 1384.20] What's that now?
[1384.98 → 1386.46] I'm not even aware of that one.
[1386.64 → 1387.22] There's a reach about Zelda 64.
[1388.52 → 1389.58] Oh, interesting.
[1391.32 → 1392.90] Some really funky screenshots.
[1394.10 → 1395.62] I haven't actually seen this.
[1395.82 → 1399.74] So wait, so Zelda 64, uh, is what?
[1399.80 → 1401.32] You're not talking Ocarina of Time.
[1401.32 → 1403.16] You're talking like a different Zelda.
[1403.48 → 1404.08] Don't think so.
[1404.36 → 1404.54] Yeah.
[1404.56 → 1406.02] I'm pretty sure it's something different.
[1407.70 → 1408.10] Fascinating.
[1408.32 → 1411.78] There's, I will try to do.
[1411.78 → 1412.20] Okay.
[1412.74 → 1413.10] Okay.
[1413.10 → 1413.12] Okay.
[1413.12 → 1415.08] Apparently there's like a skeleton bad guy.
[1415.16 → 1416.48] I have not, I have to confess.
[1416.62 → 1418.10] Luke, can I confess something to you?
[1418.76 → 1419.12] What's up?
[1419.70 → 1421.32] I have never played Ocarina of Time.
[1422.16 → 1423.54] Never played it.
[1423.54 → 1428.40] I was kind of expecting like, and I never beat it, but I never played it as crazy.
[1428.54 → 1430.28] I have tried to play it.
[1430.60 → 1435.20] So I've been an hour into it like six times.
[1435.20 → 1440.48] And I have just never managed to make it work.
[1440.98 → 1442.80] Is it, is it my time to confess?
[1443.00 → 1443.34] Okay.
[1443.96 → 1444.44] Confess.
[1445.28 → 1445.80] Same deal.
[1446.72 → 1447.16] Really?
[1447.70 → 1448.12] Yeah.
[1448.28 → 1449.72] But it's a masterpiece, Luke.
[1450.08 → 1450.52] Yeah.
[1450.62 → 1452.82] I've gotten like, I don't know.
[1452.88 → 1457.50] I don't know about an hour is the metric, but I've gotten not far enough into it.
[1457.50 → 1463.56] Like a bunch of times and then just, I don't know.
[1464.28 → 1465.24] I did something else.
[1465.24 → 1465.88] I guess I did.
[1465.98 → 1469.34] There was no like official, like, I don't want to go play that game again.
[1469.82 → 1472.36] I don't, my boys and I don't like Zelda.
[1472.62 → 1478.22] Like there was none of, there was never that moment, but I just, yeah, I've never, I've never.
[1479.74 → 1480.22] Huh.
[1480.58 → 1481.06] Okay.
[1481.90 → 1482.66] All right.
[1482.84 → 1483.44] Fair enough.
[1483.44 → 1492.82] I mean, I guess I, I, it shouldn't surprise me that much, but yeah, I don't know.
[1492.88 → 1494.16] It's supposed to be so great.
[1494.22 → 1497.34] I just, I find the little blue firefly really annoying.
[1497.78 → 1507.32] And the I think the art style has not aged as well as other like early 3d games, even on the Nintendo 64.
[1507.92 → 1510.20] But maybe part of it is just the nostalgia factor.
[1510.20 → 1516.42] Like maybe that's why Mario Kart 64 still looks okay to me, but Ocarina of Time really doesn't.
[1516.54 → 1523.44] You know, with that said, even Mario 64 looks kind of okay to me.
[1524.32 → 1525.80] Even though I never played it.
[1525.90 → 1527.08] I actually never played that either.
[1529.16 → 1530.62] I'm sorry.
[1530.76 → 1534.32] I just, I, I, I didn't own a Nintendo 64.
[1534.32 → 1538.40] So that makes it a little tougher, don't it?
[1539.20 → 1545.28] We, we did, but like, we didn't own like every game, you know, like we, we had Donkey Kong and we had Goldeneye.
[1545.66 → 1547.54] And I played the heck out of those games.
[1547.78 → 1551.14] Yellow cartridge, Donkey Kong 64 was sweet.
[1551.74 → 1552.94] We played that a lot.
[1553.36 → 1554.58] We played Goldeneye a lot.
[1555.08 → 1559.00] There was some other N64 games that we had too, but like, we didn't have like walls of them.
[1559.16 → 1559.56] Hot take.
[1559.76 → 1561.32] So Goldeneye was terrible.
[1561.32 → 1566.32] Goldeneye for its time was good.
[1567.08 → 1567.66] To be clear.
[1567.82 → 1569.86] I, I loved playing it.
[1569.96 → 1571.44] I went over to my friend Taylor's house.
[1572.10 → 1574.00] We played the crap out of Goldeneye.
[1574.18 → 1575.82] Like that was all I ever wanted to do.
[1575.86 → 1577.00] He's like, can we play Perfect Dark?
[1577.12 → 1578.32] I'm like, no, I want to play Goldeneye.
[1579.22 → 1580.30] Let's play some Goldeneye.
[1580.82 → 1583.14] But yeah, Goldeneye is one of the like worst.
[1583.58 → 1588.96] It has aged probably the worst out of like almost any game I've ever tried to go back and play.
[1588.96 → 1589.46] Yeah.
[1589.82 → 1592.04] It's such a terrible experience.
[1592.04 → 1593.24] It's like go back and play.
[1593.52 → 1593.92] Like Halo.
[1593.92 → 1594.38] Halo.
[1594.54 → 1595.04] Unplayable.
[1595.20 → 1596.54] So impactful.
[1597.04 → 1597.40] Yeah.
[1597.50 → 1600.22] On the like console shooter scene.
[1600.22 → 1603.58] Because everything before it was actually kind of trash.
[1604.22 → 1606.88] Halo came out and was just like, yeah, here we go.
[1607.24 → 1609.16] This is how you make shooters on console.
[1609.74 → 1611.20] Everyone's, you're welcome, everybody.
[1611.62 → 1613.36] And then, then they moved on.
[1614.28 → 1614.68] Yeah.
[1614.72 → 1615.16] No kidding.
[1616.06 → 1618.42] Then they made games past like, what was it?
[1618.50 → 1619.38] Halo 3 and Reach.
[1619.80 → 1620.52] And it was like, oof.
[1621.36 → 1622.18] But yeah.
[1622.60 → 1622.90] Oh, well.
[1624.16 → 1624.76] All right.
[1624.86 → 1628.12] Why don't we move on to our sponsors?
[1629.56 → 1629.96] Hooray.
[1630.20 → 1630.84] Oh, yeah.

[1682.92 → 1683.50] It's working.
[1683.70 → 1684.42] It's fine.
[1684.82 → 1685.66] There we go.
[1685.86 → 1686.18] All right.
[1686.18 → 1689.50] Today's WAN show is sponsored by Kernel Care and Cloud Linux.
[1689.82 → 1695.00] In November this year, CentOS 6 will go end of life, which means no more bug fixes, updates, or security patches.
[1695.72 → 1702.44] Without those, well, without security, I think it's fair to say that it's obvious the server is increasingly susceptible to new vulnerabilities and attacks.
[1702.96 → 1708.04] It's challenging to migrate to the newest version of CentOS, but at the same time, you can't have support either.
[1708.04 → 1715.78] Now you can make this problem disappear with CentOS 6 Extended Lifecycle Support, also called ELS from Cloud Linux,
[1715.90 → 1719.72] which will allow you to continue working with CentOS 6 beyond the end of life.
[1719.96 → 1725.28] All your fixes, patches, etc. will continue to flow just like today, only from Cloud Linux repositories.
[1725.74 → 1729.54] For a limited time, you can get a specially discounted bundle, Kernel Care live patching,
[1729.62 → 1731.92] and Extended Lifecycle Support for CentOS 6 together,
[1731.92 → 1737.18] with a 30% discount on CentOS 6 Extended Lifecycle Support and 50% off on Kernel Care.
[1737.32 → 1738.82] 15% off on Kernel Care.
[1739.92 → 1745.70] Kernel Care is a live patching system that automatically applies security patches to Linux kernels and shared libraries with no reboots
[1745.70 → 1750.56] and is used on over half a million servers and has been used to patch servers running for six years
[1750.56 → 1754.24] for such companies as Dell, Zoom, Liquid Web, and other enterprises.
[1754.24 → 1759.52] It works with all major Linux distros and interoperates flawlessly with common vulnerability scanners,
[1759.88 → 1762.66] configuration management tools, and patch management solutions.
[1762.92 → 1765.92] Learn more about the bundle and sign up for the quote at the link below.
[1766.08 → 1771.44] It is amazing how well synchronized this video has been with everything that I've been saying.
[1771.88 → 1773.04] I'm like floored.
[1773.12 → 1779.72] It's like they took my talking speed and like ran it through the AI voice generation thing that we used
[1779.72 → 1784.34] for the deepfake Linus video, and we're like,
[1784.44 → 1789.06] okay, this is about how long these talking points need to be in order for the video to sync up perfectly.
[1789.52 → 1791.18] I absolutely love that.
[1791.24 → 1792.56] That felt pre-recorded.
[1792.60 → 1793.14] It was great.
[1795.02 → 1795.56] All right.
[1795.58 → 1796.34] You sent me a link.
[1796.40 → 1797.38] You sent me a link on Twitter.
[1797.50 → 1798.56] What is this?
[1798.96 → 1799.78] Holy crap.
[1800.88 → 1801.84] Zelda 64.
[1802.00 → 1804.50] No, this is a completely different game?
[1804.50 → 1812.44] I, so that's like the UI looks super similar, but have you seen these areas?
[1813.58 → 1814.92] Neither of us playing the game.
[1815.04 → 1815.12] Yeah.
[1815.18 → 1815.90] Neither of us playing the game.
[1816.02 → 1816.56] Well, no, this.
[1816.76 → 1817.74] I don't think I've seen this before.
[1817.96 → 1822.50] That look, uh, does, does link like get older in Ocarina of Time?
[1823.24 → 1823.66] Yes.
[1824.10 → 1824.66] Oh, okay.
[1824.72 → 1824.98] Okay.
[1825.02 → 1828.32] There is young link and older link.
[1828.92 → 1831.00] Well, to me, still, it's still young at this point.
[1831.06 → 1832.12] I'm getting older, dude.
[1832.12 → 1834.34] People are going to be so upset.
[1835.16 → 1835.78] People are what?
[1835.86 → 1836.02] Sorry?
[1836.60 → 1837.74] Going to be so upset.
[1837.84 → 1839.22] I'm sorry, you guys.
[1839.32 → 1839.78] I'm sorry.
[1839.92 → 1842.64] I don't, I don't try to be awful.
[1842.86 → 1845.20] You know, it just, it just happens.
[1846.24 → 1847.62] It just happens.
[1848.44 → 1849.20] All right.
[1849.44 → 1851.52] Oh, what else do we want to talk about today?
[1851.74 → 1853.36] Oh, Dr. Disrespect showed up.
[1854.48 → 1860.04] Announced an upcoming stream yesterday with a stream, which was super confusing, but then
[1860.04 → 1865.80] clarified and then, uh, streamed today to a casual half a million viewers.
[1866.62 → 1871.52] Um, apparently at some point in the stream, the doc was like, so like, who are the who
[1871.52 → 1872.52] are like the big YouTubers?
[1872.52 → 1874.40] And I was apparently mentioned.
[1875.04 → 1875.62] Were you?
[1875.84 → 1876.66] By name.
[1877.06 → 1883.80] I'm officially, I'm officially famous now because, uh, I actually, I wasn't watching, but so maybe
[1883.80 → 1887.06] Dr. Disrespect said my name, but maybe it was just someone in the chat.
[1887.14 → 1888.10] I actually have no idea.
[1888.48 → 1891.90] But, uh, apparently I was mentioned by name on a Dr. Disrespect stream.
[1891.92 → 1893.74] So I can take that off my bucket list.
[1894.20 → 1899.34] And, uh, we reached out on Twitter, uh, cause, uh, we were like, Hey, you know, we built PewDiePie,
[1899.34 → 1900.60] uh, PC that broke in the mail.
[1900.66 → 1906.50] Maybe we could do the same for you, by the way, before, before chat blows up asking what's
[1906.50 → 1907.24] going on with it.
[1907.36 → 1910.22] We have all the parts for the two mad PC.
[1911.32 → 1915.06] I have no idea what I'm getting myself into with this.
[1915.28 → 1920.10] Um, well, actually I do have some idea, which is part of why I feel a little apprehensive,
[1920.36 → 1926.04] but the last email I have from him is, uh, from three days ago.
[1926.04 → 1928.80] And he says, yes, let's go.
[1929.80 → 1932.56] So I'm going to film, uh, okay.
[1932.56 → 1935.12] He's doing something first, and I'm not going to leak that.
[1935.22 → 1937.22] I'm not going to like, but he's going to do a thing.
[1937.54 → 1940.78] And then he's like, we will sort of time for me to come in.
[1940.88 → 1946.38] I'm assuming your office, and we will build the damn thingy is, uh, is what he said.
[1946.82 → 1949.48] And then I said, Hey, we got to make sure we got our masks on.
[1949.52 → 1952.76] He says, yeah, I'll rock up in a gas mask and a chem suit.
[1952.76 → 1957.34] And you know what, with this guy, I don't even doubt it.
[1957.42 → 1960.68] You know, like there's nothing he could do to surprise me.
[1960.78 → 1965.44] I don't, um, so I'm very, very excited.
[1965.60 → 1966.62] It's going to be a lot of fun.
[1967.24 → 1970.40] Um, these are the kinds of collabs that I do have a ton of fun with.
[1970.40 → 1971.98] Just the very spontaneous stuff.
[1971.98 → 1973.70] Like I think he was just tweeting.
[1973.82 → 1975.18] He was like, yo, I need a PC.
[1975.28 → 1975.70] What's up?
[1975.70 → 1977.90] And I'm like, who cares?
[1977.98 → 1978.40] Why not?
[1978.50 → 1978.98] You know what?
[1978.98 → 1984.88] This is the one time that someone just tweeting you and being like free PC question mark has worked.
[1985.34 → 1988.32] You know, so you're saying there's a chance.
[1988.50 → 1989.12] I checked out.
[1989.54 → 1991.66] Look, I checked out his Twitter feed.
[1991.78 → 1993.46] I checked out his Twitter feed.
[1993.56 → 2002.14] I was like, this guy is the least PC, you know, individual that I've ever encountered in my life.
[2002.24 → 2003.80] I need to give him some PC.
[2004.06 → 2005.80] You know, that's all I'm saying about it.
[2005.80 → 2006.48] Oh, I see.
[2006.48 → 2008.52] He just, he clearly needs more PC.
[2008.86 → 2009.36] That's it.
[2009.46 → 2010.14] Yeah, that's it.
[2010.22 → 2010.56] I'm helping.
[2010.92 → 2019.18] So if you make it very clear on your Twitter feed that you need a computer, and you reach out, you might get a computer.
[2019.38 → 2019.98] No, no, no, no, no.
[2020.00 → 2021.84] I'm not saying the chance is high.
[2021.92 → 2023.68] I didn't say it was because he needs a PC.
[2024.02 → 2025.78] I said it's because he needs PC.
[2026.54 → 2029.84] You know, he just, he's just not, not very PC.
[2030.00 → 2030.48] That's all.
[2030.52 → 2031.80] That's all I have to say about it.
[2031.80 → 2034.82] Oh, man.
[2034.96 → 2036.58] I just, I have no idea.
[2036.74 → 2038.28] I have no idea what curveball.
[2038.36 → 2039.68] I just, I don't know.
[2039.76 → 2041.40] Maybe, maybe he'll show up.
[2041.48 → 2048.42] Maybe he'll show up in a, in a, in a dress shirt, and he'll just be like, you know, super respectful, and we'll just build a computer nicely.
[2048.42 → 2052.78] I've seen him, I've seen him do like serious conversation stuff.
[2053.34 → 2054.58] I've seen it happen.
[2054.78 → 2056.44] I'm not saying that's what you're going to get.
[2056.50 → 2056.62] Yeah.
[2056.64 → 2064.24] I've also seen him drop in on people's Zoom college lectures with like, you know, one of those big like hats.
[2064.48 → 2064.74] No shirt on.
[2064.92 → 2066.00] And no shirt on.
[2066.12 → 2066.92] And like, yeah.
[2067.18 → 2068.00] Oh, man.
[2069.14 → 2069.42] Yeah.
[2069.42 → 2075.14] I think the chance of him not having a shirt on at some point in time in that video is pretty high.
[2078.34 → 2078.82] Yeah.
[2079.18 → 2080.14] Oh, okay.
[2080.40 → 2080.88] Anyway.
[2081.28 → 2082.70] Also, other thing.
[2083.08 → 2083.44] Yeah.
[2083.56 → 2085.12] Every colour of water bottle.
[2086.50 → 2087.86] Lttstore.com, baby.
[2088.02 → 2089.54] Gold is back in stock.
[2091.62 → 2093.52] Bigger equals better.
[2094.08 → 2095.44] It doesn't have to cost more.
[2095.44 → 2100.92] The $29.99 price is the same for both the 20 and 40 ounce.
[2100.98 → 2101.46] And I'm rounding.
[2101.66 → 2102.98] I think it's like 21 or whatever.
[2103.34 → 2106.30] But the 20 and 40 ounce bottle are both $29.99.
[2106.70 → 2113.40] And we've got every colour in stock, including black and gold, which is the hottest seller.
[2113.52 → 2114.74] So we just got our ocean shipment.
[2115.34 → 2119.16] This is the last restock we're going to have for probably a while.
[2119.24 → 2120.42] We don't have anything else on order.
[2120.52 → 2123.48] So get in there if you want to get the 40 ounce bottle.
[2124.48 → 2125.42] They are awesome.
[2125.94 → 2126.88] They really are.
[2127.00 → 2129.04] It's the correct amount of water.
[2129.98 → 2135.06] I went with the original 21 ounce size because I was like, well, I got small hands.
[2135.14 → 2136.20] I can't hold the big one.
[2136.70 → 2138.10] And it turns out, you know what?
[2138.12 → 2141.00] I just got to grip it harder, you know?
[2141.06 → 2143.76] Just got to like to go for it, you know?
[2143.76 → 2145.96] I was going to ask if you had to go for the two hand.
[2146.04 → 2147.44] I managed it.
[2147.46 → 2148.70] I managed it with the one hand.
[2148.78 → 2149.92] I just got to get good, you know?
[2150.58 → 2151.96] It is a little grippy too.
[2152.22 → 2152.86] I'll give it that.
[2153.00 → 2153.18] Yep.
[2153.32 → 2154.04] It's not bad.
[2154.20 → 2154.68] It's not bad.
[2154.68 → 2155.32] It's very holdable.
[2155.32 → 2155.94] It's not like crazy or anything.
[2156.02 → 2156.60] It's very holdable.
[2156.70 → 2158.00] You just got to like to hold it, you know?
[2159.14 → 2159.66] All right.
[2159.70 → 2161.38] Let's talk about TikTok, shall we?
[2162.18 → 2162.58] Sure.
[2162.70 → 2169.40] Time's a Tiptoeing because in 45 days, TikTok and WeChat will be banned from doing business
[2169.40 → 2170.92] with U.S. companies.
[2170.92 → 2175.00] Today, U.S. President Donald Trump.
[2175.80 → 2178.96] It's the formal name for him.
[2179.56 → 2180.02] Formal title.
[2180.02 → 2191.38] And as it's worded, their parent companies, ByteDance and Tencent Holdings were any subsidiary of, except not so much.
[2191.38 → 2196.78] Because while Tencent has shares in everything.
[2197.30 → 2197.86] Yeah.
[2197.86 → 2198.86] Just to be clear.
[2199.16 → 2201.82] Tons of movies, Riot Games, Epic Games.
[2201.94 → 2202.16] Yeah.
[2202.74 → 2203.82] Lots of others.
[2204.36 → 2211.08] Apparently, it's just, even though it says subsidiary thereof, it's just relating to WeChat.
[2211.08 → 2211.52] Okay.
[2213.06 → 2215.40] And transactions relating to WeChat.
[2215.82 → 2216.96] Well, here's the thing.
[2217.86 → 2218.44] You know what?
[2218.90 → 2219.34] No.
[2219.54 → 2229.82] I'm actually shocked to see a poorly worded, ill-prepared executive order coming out of the current administration.
[2230.12 → 2230.68] You're shocked?
[2230.80 → 2231.38] I'm shocked.
[2232.10 → 2233.50] I'm shocked and appalled.
[2233.50 → 2241.36] The news comes after revelations that the app collected and transmitted user data, even when it wasn't running.
[2243.02 → 2248.82] We've got a note here that this was possibly a bug and isn't actually that uncommon for social media apps.
[2249.28 → 2252.94] It's been found with quite a few North American ones in the past.
[2253.12 → 2258.20] This security issue has been called intentional data collection on behalf of the Chinese government, in this case.
[2258.20 → 2265.66] And several other countries have already blocked the app in its entirety, with the Trump administration having threatened to do so outright multiple times already.
[2266.30 → 2277.74] So, the executive order gives a 45-day grace period before enforcement, and it's unclear what effect any of this will have on users who use TikTok or the WeChat app.
[2277.86 → 2280.04] Will the ban mean removal of the apps from major app stores?
[2280.54 → 2284.72] Will it mean that somehow the apps will be automatically removed from your phone?
[2284.72 → 2290.76] To my knowledge, an app disappearing from an app store doesn't actually remove it from your phone, particularly on Android.
[2290.86 → 2296.68] I don't see what would prevent you from just sideloading an APK, so I don't know what difference it would make as far as that goes.
[2297.20 → 2300.58] Government employees have separately been banned from having the apps on their devices, though.
[2301.48 → 2310.84] And TikTok is apparently in acquisition talks with at least three American companies, according to the New York Times, including Microsoft, which could help it escape the ban if it goes through.
[2310.84 → 2319.98] I got logged out of my Google Sheet, or my Doc, so I can't continue to tell you anything about this, and Luke will take it from here while I sign back in.
[2319.98 → 2331.08] Yeah, while TikTok doesn't operate in China, funny enough, WeChat does, and apparently many expats use it for communicating with friends and family at home in China.
[2331.64 → 2348.26] So, in a hilarious UNO Reverse card thing, or Reverse card thing, whatever that's called, never actually really played UNO, you might have to use a VPN to get into China to use WeChat to talk to people.
[2348.26 → 2352.28] You know what's hilarious is I was trying to do this at some point.
[2352.60 → 2362.68] I was trying to VPN inside the Great Firewall because I wanted to know if some workaround was going to work when I was there.
[2362.80 → 2363.64] Once you got there, okay.
[2363.64 → 2365.52] And it is almost impossible.
[2365.52 → 2370.06] Like, I'm sure if you're a network security researcher, you could do it pretty easily.
[2370.46 → 2376.12] But as just, you know, the consumer that's like, hey, yeah, you know, I'll install PIA, that's a VPN or whatever.
[2377.08 → 2383.00] It was almost impossible for me to figure out a quick, easy, and or inexpensive way to do it.
[2383.54 → 2385.44] Nobody wants to do that.
[2385.44 → 2390.26] And part of the problem is that, you know how, like, search works, right?
[2390.30 → 2393.60] Like, it's all down to kind of, like, word weight.
[2394.08 → 2401.32] Like, you don't even have to construct a coherent sentence for it to kind of infer what you're talking about.
[2401.32 → 2411.54] So when you search for something like China Firewall VPN, you're just, the information is out there for sure for how to go this way.
[2411.78 → 2423.12] But because the vast, vast, the vast majority of people are trying to go the other way, as soon as those search terms enter your browser bar, it's like, oh, are you looking for this?
[2423.44 → 2424.68] Like, no, no, not that.
[2424.74 → 2425.50] I want the other one.
[2425.56 → 2426.12] Come on.
[2428.32 → 2428.80] Yeah.
[2429.10 → 2430.06] Oh, man.
[2430.06 → 2431.30] Yeah, I don't know.
[2431.62 → 2434.76] Honestly, like, if WeChat was banned, it would be pretty inconvenient for me.
[2434.88 → 2439.54] I mean, not directly, because I'm Canadian, and our government is not doing anything like this.
[2439.66 → 2441.08] So I can continue using WeChat.
[2441.20 → 2442.20] But, like, I don't know.
[2442.20 → 2443.26] I got lots of friends on WeChat.
[2443.38 → 2444.30] That would be sort of a pain in the butt.
[2445.00 → 2446.66] And I don't even have family over there or anything.
[2446.78 → 2455.60] It's just, like, useful because a lot of, like, man, I use WhatsApp for most of my, like, personal crap.
[2455.60 → 2460.72] But almost all of my badminton contacts are through Line or WeChat.
[2460.72 → 2461.72] I don't know if I can do that.
[2461.72 → 2464.66] Because that's just, you kind of just have to use, like, I hate this.
[2464.84 → 2471.34] I wish we could just have trillion back, and I could consolidate all of my different chat crap.
[2471.74 → 2475.44] Like, I don't understand people on iOS that are like, yeah, yeah, like, iMessage, iMessage.
[2476.20 → 2477.46] What iMessage?
[2477.46 → 2487.94] Unless you literally restrict your social circle to only people with iPhones, you're going to have other chat apps on your phone anyway.
[2488.20 → 2489.32] So who cares?
[2491.70 → 2493.02] Maybe they did that, though.
[2493.94 → 2496.78] In which case, why are you talking to me?
[2497.62 → 2499.74] Clearly, we have nothing in common, right?
[2499.74 → 2502.54] So you might as well, you know, go look.
[2502.64 → 2503.64] Sorry, can't speak.
[2504.02 → 2504.66] Can't speak.
[2505.24 → 2509.08] You know, AirPods aren't really a status symbol at this point.
[2509.48 → 2511.32] You know, I'm going to put my AirPods back in.
[2511.38 → 2511.82] See ya.
[2513.36 → 2513.80] Whatever.
[2514.02 → 2514.92] I don't even care.
[2515.08 → 2515.86] I'm over it.
[2516.08 → 2516.66] I'm over it.
[2516.68 → 2517.28] I'm over them.
[2518.12 → 2518.86] I moved on.
[2519.42 → 2523.56] Some people are pointing out, like, uh, trillion's still a thing.
[2525.34 → 2525.74] Yeah.
[2525.74 → 2528.56] Yeah, but not in the way that I'm talking about.
[2528.56 → 2531.34] Not in the way that it was kind of able to be used originally.
[2531.62 → 2531.94] Yeah.
[2532.20 → 2532.64] Um.
[2533.06 → 2533.72] Because it was what?
[2533.92 → 2538.12] ICQ, MSN Messenger, and AIM was the TRI of trillion, wasn't it?
[2538.70 → 2541.70] Everything that people used to use, essentially.
[2541.90 → 2542.06] Yeah.
[2542.14 → 2542.42] Yes.
[2543.02 → 2554.00] So the idea was you could consolidate all of your contact lists and everything and just have one app that you, that tapped into all these different, um, chat services.
[2554.78 → 2556.52] Didn't Pidgin kind of work this way, too?
[2556.52 → 2559.74] Um, if I recall correctly, yes, but I never used it.
[2559.80 → 2562.66] So I don't have a ton of experience with it, unfortunately.
[2563.06 → 2566.26] I think I used Pidgin and for effectively the same thing.
[2566.26 → 2574.64] Um, but yeah, there was cool apps back in the day when, like, you didn't have to worry, but it was basically like, uh, like multi-platform support for games.
[2574.78 → 2582.86] You didn't have to worry about what platform the person really had because you would just make an account for each one, log into all of them through this client.
[2582.86 → 2585.96] And then it would just bring all of them together.
[2586.08 → 2588.80] It would just be like one system for, for, for each.
[2588.82 → 2591.16] Then you would just bask in your own cleverness.
[2591.86 → 2595.06] Be like, I am so smart right now.
[2595.18 → 2597.82] I don't have to give any craps about any of this.
[2597.82 → 2599.10] It was great.
[2599.48 → 2600.12] And back then.
[2600.12 → 2601.80] It would be a really, really nice modern thing.
[2601.96 → 2602.68] Back then it was.
[2602.68 → 2603.16] So many.
[2603.26 → 2611.18] Kind of big deal because, uh, computers had so little resources that actually having like a bunch of chat apps open at the same time kind of sucked.
[2611.18 → 2616.96] And maybe that was just me because I was still running like a penny on one 66, but, uh, that's how I felt.
[2617.08 → 2617.30] Okay.
[2617.36 → 2618.10] That's how I felt.
[2619.10 → 2628.60] The, the modern issue for me with notifications is that I don't, I don't feel like companies, uh, desktop or mobile.
[2630.92 → 2636.38] I don't know why they don't have like a, a nuclear alert option for notifications.
[2636.38 → 2636.86] Yeah.
[2636.96 → 2638.86] Especially reminders on Android.
[2639.38 → 2639.82] Yes.
[2640.06 → 2640.30] Remind.
[2641.18 → 2642.50] They're basically useless.
[2642.78 → 2643.08] Yep.
[2643.34 → 2648.08] Like I, I, they just stack in the bottom of my notifications list.
[2648.40 → 2650.42] They just add more to themselves all the time.
[2650.62 → 2651.88] They don't help me almost at all.
[2652.02 → 2661.62] Like I need, I need an ability to tell my, my phone or my desktop or whatever, like, no, don't stop freaking out until I answer this notification.
[2661.76 → 2664.76] There has to be like some way to do that.
[2664.94 → 2670.88] Alarms are not bad, but this has been really bothering me ever since Google, uh, blocked.
[2670.88 → 2675.70] I've been using reminders, uh, for, um, paying users, uh, like enterprise users.
[2675.70 → 2677.88] I haven't been able to use reminders anymore.
[2677.88 → 2685.74] Um, and alarms would be a perfect substitute for it, except that you're not allowed to set an alarm more than 24 hours ahead.
[2685.74 → 2686.24] Yeah.
[2686.24 → 2694.02] So I have to, so I have to go through tediously create a calendar event with like multiple notifications to make sure I actually see it to set myself.
[2694.02 → 2703.10] An alarm to make sure that I see something or by that time, I'll just, you know, create a calendar event and put like six notifications on it or whatever.
[2703.10 → 2708.74] Like email me the night before and like, you know, message, you know, do this half, half an hour and five minutes.
[2708.74 → 2720.58] Cause the reality of it is I am pretty busy, and I get a lot of notifications and I need something to kind of break through, especially because notifications are so poorly handled on Android.
[2720.58 → 2727.40] The fact that there is no setting on Android that says, Hey, a new notification, put it at the top.
[2728.02 → 2730.60] Do not put it anywhere else.
[2730.82 → 2734.04] That is the only place a new notification goes.
[2734.20 → 2735.84] It drives me absolutely crazy.
[2735.84 → 2742.18] Because I'll get a notification for something as stupid as like my garage door has been open for 10 minutes or whatever.
[2742.18 → 2749.68] So my phone will buzz, but it's just hiding down at the bottom apps don't have to have a timestamp on their notifications.
[2749.68 → 2750.04] Yeah.
[2750.04 → 2763.94] It boggles my mind that Trello does not have timestamps on the individual notifications, because if you've got even we're a 30-person organization and I still get absolutely spammed with Trello notifications.
[2763.94 → 2771.74] Not knowing when they arrived means that my phone might buzz, and I might look at it, and maybe it was a Trello notification, but like, I don't know.
[2772.44 → 2773.64] Cause there's no timestamp.
[2773.80 → 2774.88] It's not at the top.
[2775.18 → 2777.80] It blows my mind.
[2777.80 → 2780.80] That's something that basic is not default.
[2781.76 → 2782.30] Never mind.
[2782.40 → 2783.08] Not an option.
[2783.80 → 2783.98] Yeah.
[2784.40 → 2785.24] I hate it.
[2785.84 → 2785.96] Yeah.
[2786.04 → 2786.98] It's, it's, it's nuts.
[2787.10 → 2788.12] And they're like my phone.
[2788.22 → 2793.64] I don't know if it's because it's like too old now or what, but I keep manually disabling.
[2793.64 → 2796.12] This, like, it's not battery saver.
[2796.24 → 2797.44] It's something else.
[2797.44 → 2800.30] Like the battery optimization, like AI nonsense or.
[2801.14 → 2801.62] Yeah.
[2802.62 → 2810.66] I mean, they're both off right now, and it's still doing it, but my, my phone will just not deliver me notifications.
[2810.90 → 2812.74] I'll have it sitting right next to me.
[2812.74 → 2813.14] Yeah.
[2813.18 → 2813.80] Right there.
[2813.90 → 2821.24] I have it on something that when it vibrates, it will be loud, but I have it muted, and it will do nothing all day.
[2821.24 → 2828.04] And then I'll like to put down my water or something, and it'll bump my phone, and it'll like to do the little mini screen wake thing.
[2828.16 → 2829.52] And it'll just sit there.
[2830.40 → 2836.76] And do notification spam for like two minutes of all the things that I missed over the last few hours.
[2836.76 → 2842.98] And I'm like, why, why, why weren't you beeping every time one of these came through or like vibrating or something.
[2842.98 → 2844.24] And then I go to check my train.
[2844.36 → 2846.68] I have 10 million things, and they're not in order.
[2846.68 → 2847.82] Like you were just talking about.
[2847.90 → 2848.16] Yeah.
[2848.16 → 2851.32] All the YouTube videos that came through are like big blocks.
[2851.32 → 2855.58] I'm like, I don't care about this, but all the things that actually matter are stacked notifications.
[2855.58 → 2857.38] It's just like, what the heck?
[2858.20 → 2859.72] It's so frustrating.
[2860.02 → 2865.32] And then you're at your desktop, and you have 18,000 different potential ways that someone can contact you.
[2865.44 → 2871.12] And one of them beings, but you happen to forget the exact notification noise for that exact app.
[2871.24 → 2871.38] Yeah.
[2871.38 → 2874.38] And you're just like, well, I have no clue what just happened.
[2874.98 → 2882.00] My whole thing is like, unless you email me, there is like a very solid chance that you will never hear from me again about it.
[2882.00 → 2884.04] Like that's, that's basically it.
[2884.04 → 2885.52] Unless you email or call me.
[2885.60 → 2888.16] Those are, those are the only two ways to, to break through.
[2888.54 → 2893.12] Joshua Campbell in the chat says, you could use if this than that and phone calls, Luke.
[2893.66 → 2895.60] That is a ridiculous workaround.
[2896.24 → 2897.06] Cool idea.
[2897.84 → 2902.90] But the fact that we're resorting to that is absurd.
[2903.96 → 2905.80] That shouldn't even be a conversation.
[2907.66 → 2908.02] Yeah.
[2908.14 → 2910.08] Someone says that sounds like do not disturb.
[2910.08 → 2912.18] Do not disturb is turned off on my phone right now.
[2912.22 → 2912.74] I just checked.
[2913.40 → 2913.76] Yeah.
[2914.00 → 2915.62] No, I've seen it before too.
[2916.14 → 2925.96] A perfect one with teams for a bit was how when you disconnected and reconnected to Wi-Fi, you would get like the last three hours of notifications, even for messages you had like replied to already.
[2926.82 → 2928.02] It drives me crazy.
[2928.16 → 2930.42] I complain about teams and people are like, what's so bad about teams?
[2930.52 → 2932.12] I'm like, what isn't bad about teams?
[2932.12 → 2947.94] It's like, honestly, there was, there was a period for a long time there where it was like a 30% chance that if someone was calling me through teams, I would have any way of navigating to that call and accepting it.
[2947.94 → 2955.42] Otherwise, it would just be my phone making the ringing noise and there'd be like no way to accept the call, even if I manually went to my chat with that person.
[2956.68 → 2957.16] Terrible.
[2957.88 → 2958.36] Terrible.
[2958.74 → 2960.36] It's getting better, in fairness.
[2960.36 → 2961.36] Terrible.
[2961.36 → 2962.36] Terrible.
[2962.36 → 2962.48] All right.
[2962.52 → 2964.10] Why don't we talk, get unpacked with Samsung.
[2964.96 → 2967.76] Samsung announced a bunch of stuff on their stream.
[2968.18 → 2971.34] Samsung and Microsoft have teamed up for syncing between devices.
[2971.50 → 2973.58] So you can take calls on your phone or PC.
[2974.18 → 2976.28] Notes will sync to Microsoft apps.
[2976.40 → 2979.88] Some reminders sync, assuming they actually like do anything.
[2980.18 → 2982.52] You can sync your Samsung photos with OneDrive.
[2982.78 → 2983.48] That's pretty cool.
[2983.50 → 2988.22] I guess if you like paying for cloud storage, Plex, Plex master race.
[2988.22 → 2992.70] Xbox game pass will allow you to play games from your phone and tablet.
[2993.00 → 2995.82] A couple of mentioned games were grounded in Minecraft Dungeons.
[2996.08 → 3000.14] And of course, they announced the note 20 and note 20 ultra.
[3000.52 → 3004.14] So the note 20 is not a full-fledged flagship.
[3004.14 → 3006.44] As far as we can tell, it's got a polycarbonate back.
[3006.50 → 3007.96] It does have a flagship processor.
[3007.96 → 3011.90] So 865 plus in the US and Enos 990 elsewhere.
[3012.14 → 3015.28] But it caps at 256 gigs of onboard storage.
[3015.28 → 3016.68] It's got just eight gigs of RAM.
[3016.68 → 3022.16] A 1080 class display at 60 hertz, although it is still HDR 10 plus.
[3022.70 → 3027.00] And three cameras, 4300 William hour battery, hole punch selfie camera.
[3027.34 → 3029.32] And starts at a whopping $1,000.
[3030.30 → 3033.14] Man, that Pixel 4a is looking pretty good, hey?
[3034.40 → 3038.22] I actually did my short circuit unboxing of the Pixel 4a.
[3038.28 → 3040.48] We got it late because Canada things.
[3040.78 → 3042.36] It's launching in September.
[3042.36 → 3045.24] So why would you need it at the same time as the rest of the global media?
[3045.24 → 3048.56] Gee, I don't know because it's the same phone.
[3048.78 → 3052.88] So Canadians are going to be learning about it when the information is available.
[3052.88 → 3058.28] They don't wait for your phone to ship in Canada because they don't because the internet doesn't have borders.
[3058.96 → 3059.92] Except in China.
[3060.40 → 3062.86] Note 20 Ultra has a glass back.
[3062.96 → 3063.76] And America now.
[3063.76 → 3064.42] Same processor.
[3064.42 → 3065.04] Yeah, I know, right?
[3065.26 → 3066.04] Same processor.
[3066.54 → 3069.16] Up to 512 gigs of onboard storage.
[3069.28 → 3072.02] And that is expandable with micros XC.
[3072.60 → 3073.80] 12 gigs of RAM.
[3074.14 → 3075.90] A 1440 class display.
[3076.52 → 3077.38] Also HDR10.
[3077.64 → 3079.68] The new Gorilla Glass Vitus.
[3080.44 → 3081.30] I love that name.
[3081.40 → 3085.76] We've reached out to Corning to see if they're willing to talk to us about it and learn some stuff.
[3085.76 → 3089.74] It has a 108 megapixel wide camera.
[3091.00 → 3092.74] Sorry, that's the like normal camera.
[3092.88 → 3094.02] 12 megapixel periscope.
[3094.26 → 3095.46] Ooh, five times optical zoom.
[3095.60 → 3096.30] 8K video.
[3097.28 → 3098.26] Hole punch camera.
[3098.36 → 3100.76] 4,500 William hour battery and starts at $1,299.
[3101.04 → 3101.68] Yes, my friends.
[3101.86 → 3102.42] $1,300.
[3102.88 → 3109.00] You can get yourself one Note 20 Ultra or a total of, what is that workout to?
[3109.00 → 3114.20] Three iPhone SE's or like three and a half pixel 4As.
[3116.06 → 3117.04] Womp.
[3117.38 → 3119.58] But hey, the S Pen has lower latency.
[3119.94 → 3122.00] Uses AI to predict where the next point is.
[3122.52 → 3122.98] Okay.
[3124.74 → 3125.74] Blah, blah, blah.
[3126.00 → 3126.88] Mystic Bronze.
[3128.00 → 3128.86] Mystic Gray.
[3129.06 → 3130.00] Something's a new tablet.
[3131.14 → 3133.30] When's the last time anyone cared about an Android tablet?
[3133.42 → 3134.12] Can I just skip that?
[3135.52 → 3136.44] I think so.
[3136.44 → 3136.74] Okay.
[3136.74 → 3137.92] Galaxy Buds Live.
[3138.26 → 3141.08] Also in Mystic Bronze, Mystic Black, and Mystic White.
[3141.86 → 3144.14] The buds in case are made out of recycled materials.
[3144.22 → 3145.16] I'm going to want to check those out.
[3145.22 → 3146.00] That sounds pretty cool.
[3146.12 → 3147.18] Coming on August 6th.
[3147.20 → 3148.24] So that was yesterday.
[3148.42 → 3153.58] I guess I'll just get them on the Canada schedule, and I'll get back to you guys about how that goes.
[3154.04 → 3156.02] Galaxy Watch 3 starting at $400.
[3157.72 → 3158.50] Looks all right.
[3159.60 → 3162.40] I tried, which one did I try a while back?
[3162.50 → 3162.90] I don't know.
[3162.90 → 3165.88] I absolutely hated it to the point where I didn't review it.
[3165.88 → 3170.66] My Apple Watch is my silent protest over the state of Android wearables.
[3171.10 → 3174.06] All I want is a Pebble time, but like modern.
[3175.06 → 3180.26] I was using it for a little bit because I use it to change music tracks when I'm on my bike.
[3180.94 → 3185.92] And I was like, wow, this is just so much better.
[3185.92 → 3191.72] All my apps, no matter what they are, I just get like the message and I can just scroll down it.
[3191.80 → 3192.56] Tactile buttons.
[3193.06 → 3193.88] What a concept.
[3194.62 → 3196.88] The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is coming.
[3197.22 → 3198.12] Three rear cameras.
[3198.76 → 3203.46] It's still a tiny display and really thick when you put it in your pocket.
[3203.64 → 3208.94] I don't really understand why anyone has any desire for this type of folding device.
[3208.94 → 3211.76] But hey, you know, that's cool.
[3211.90 → 3212.56] What is it?
[3212.56 → 3212.86] Who is it?
[3213.14 → 3213.52] Oh, wait.
[3213.58 → 3213.90] No, no, no.
[3213.92 → 3214.74] This is the other one.
[3214.98 → 3215.38] Never mind.
[3215.58 → 3217.08] No, this is not the flip.
[3217.20 → 3217.34] Sorry.
[3217.40 → 3218.40] This is the Z Fold 2.
[3218.54 → 3221.00] I totally, totally got this wrong.
[3221.56 → 3223.60] But hey, that's par for the course on the WAN show.
[3223.92 → 3224.86] It's off the cuff.
[3225.42 → 3227.14] Jake attended the presentation, actually.
[3227.18 → 3228.98] I'm just waiting for the actual devices to arrive.
[3229.06 → 3229.50] Okay, never mind.
[3229.56 → 3229.88] I lied.
[3229.96 → 3231.14] I'm really excited about this one.
[3231.14 → 3232.76] This one looks really legit.
[3232.98 → 3235.16] Full screen on the front instead of the tiny screen.
[3235.80 → 3237.40] Hopefully the display is a little brighter.
[3237.52 → 3239.38] I don't know how much we do or don't know about it.
[3239.42 → 3241.90] Because like I said, I didn't actually attend the presentation.
[3243.02 → 3248.46] But we're finally getting to the point where I'm even kind of excited.
[3248.94 → 3251.04] No stupid hole punch selfie camera.
[3251.18 → 3256.80] Because obviously you could just take the picture using like something else in this screen.
[3256.88 → 3259.24] But for whatever reason, they still wouldn't put a hole punch on this one.
[3259.24 → 3260.24] I guess because they can.
[3260.74 → 3261.60] I'm jazzed.
[3261.66 → 3262.08] I'm amped.
[3262.20 → 3262.46] Never mind.
[3262.56 → 3263.80] I'm very excited about this one.
[3263.80 → 3265.92] Reinforced display layers.
[3266.26 → 3267.56] Nothing about brightness.
[3267.80 → 3268.46] 400 nits.
[3268.58 → 3269.14] Not enough.
[3270.06 → 3272.28] I didn't notice it when I was doing my review.
[3272.70 → 3276.58] But when I went on a trip down to California, I was trying to use it outside.
[3276.64 → 3278.10] I was like, oh, I remember this.
[3278.46 → 3279.60] It was too dim.
[3280.16 → 3281.92] It would be 5G, dual intelligent batteries.
[3282.34 → 3283.34] Yeah, I'm excited.
[3283.60 → 3284.22] I'm pretty excited.
[3284.22 → 3288.06] So that Note 20.
[3289.28 → 3290.10] Actually, yeah.
[3290.18 → 3291.00] Just the Note 20.
[3291.10 → 3292.30] Not even the Note 20 Ultra.
[3292.62 → 3293.86] For about the same price.
[3293.96 → 3297.04] You could get a used 2006 Mazda 3 hatchback.
[3297.60 → 3297.96] Really?
[3298.90 → 3299.70] Want to link me to that?
[3300.36 → 3302.68] That's if we were equating Canadian dollars.
[3302.86 → 3303.82] Can you link me to that?
[3303.88 → 3305.34] Because I mean, Mazda 3.
[3305.70 → 3309.20] You know, hey, that's a pragmatic vehicle.
[3309.20 → 3313.88] So this is, I'm assuming you can haggle at least 100 bucks off this price.
[3314.02 → 3314.34] Okay.
[3314.38 → 3316.70] So you're figuring I can save $100 here.
[3316.76 → 3319.60] Mind you, the conversion between USD and CAD is like...
[3320.16 → 3322.30] That automatically makes it so that you'd be fine.
[3322.30 → 3323.60] Yeah, you could afford this.
[3323.84 → 3324.34] No problem.
[3324.94 → 3327.22] I mean, how many kilometres on this puppy?
[3327.38 → 3327.60] Okay.
[3328.12 → 3331.70] 140,000 kilometres on the engine.
[3331.88 → 3333.38] Oh, because the engine is newer.
[3333.38 → 3333.70] Okay.
[3335.08 → 3336.94] 260,000 kilometres overall.
[3337.14 → 3342.42] So that's like 100,000 miles versus, you know, yeah, 100,000 miles on the engine.
[3343.50 → 3345.76] Transmission engine, all-season tires in great shape.
[3345.92 → 3346.48] Power everything.
[3346.72 → 3349.60] Working AC and Compact Disc player.
[3350.12 → 3351.14] Selling as is.
[3351.50 → 3351.84] All right?
[3351.96 → 3353.42] So it's as is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3354.02 → 3357.56] And that's also literally the first car that I found at that price.
[3357.68 → 3359.26] I didn't exactly look around.
[3359.88 → 3360.72] It's got some dings.
[3360.72 → 3361.04] Okay.
[3361.16 → 3362.04] It's got some scratches.
[3362.04 → 3365.50] You know, your phone, your new phone probably won't have any scratches.
[3366.30 → 3368.08] But hey, it's not much worse than a Tesla.
[3368.42 → 3370.16] So looks okay.
[3370.72 → 3380.38] So I feel like I should explain my late night tweet yesterday talking about Tesla's QC procedure.
[3380.98 → 3387.52] So it's been very interesting going through the process of buying a Tesla.
[3388.54 → 3389.96] It's not for myself.
[3389.96 → 3394.04] We actually decided to treat our in-laws to a new vehicle.
[3394.42 → 3394.78] Wow.
[3394.78 → 3395.32] Yeah.
[3395.32 → 3395.42] Wow.
[3395.58 → 3395.96] Yeah.
[3396.10 → 3399.18] Their car had all kinds of, like, little issues.
[3399.18 → 3402.92] Like, you know, you couldn't lock, like, this door.
[3403.08 → 3405.54] So you had to, like, lean across and unlock it.
[3405.54 → 3407.74] And the tailgate hydraulics weren't working anymore.
[3407.90 → 3413.06] And it's at the point now where it's, like, old enough that it's probably not...
[3413.06 → 3418.16] By the time you fix all those little stupid things, you've paid more than the total vehicle is worth.
[3418.16 → 3424.92] So you might as well just flip it on Craigslist to someone who feels like fixing all that stuff themselves or doesn't care and get something else.
[3424.92 → 3426.36] So we decided, you know what?
[3426.38 → 3431.76] They've probably done, like, 75 grand worth of childcare for us over the last eight years.
[3432.80 → 3433.96] Let's buy them a Model Y.
[3433.96 → 3435.42] So we went for it.
[3436.70 → 3444.56] And one of the things that I tweeted about as part of this experience, which has honestly been, like, pretty frustrating in a number of ways.
[3445.42 → 3449.60] Like, their customer service has been very hit or miss, depending on who we're dealing with.
[3449.62 → 3450.60] And that can be true of anyone.
[3450.72 → 3452.08] So I wasn't going to harp on them for that.
[3452.24 → 3460.82] But on delivery, they basically seem to have this expectation that there's going to be things wrong with the car.
[3460.82 → 3468.92] And they've got a whole process around this where, assuming they are a small thing, you go through them, you do, like, an inspection.
[3469.18 → 3473.22] And it's not like we didn't do an inspection with our Odyssey, like our minivan, when we bought it.
[3473.44 → 3480.00] But at the inspection, they were not expecting to find anything wrong because there's this whole thing.
[3480.10 → 3487.80] It's called PDI, where the dealer, like, goes over the car with a fine-toothed comb and, like, makes sure that it's probably fine.
[3488.38 → 3490.20] It seems to be pretty standard.
[3490.82 → 3492.18] And you might still have problems.
[3492.24 → 3493.56] And there can still be recalls.
[3494.26 → 3495.12] Stuff happens.
[3495.62 → 3505.48] But the idea is that it doesn't have, like, you know, red marks on the paint job because, you know, someone checked and, like, buffed it out already.
[3506.14 → 3508.92] So Tesla has this procedure where they go through with you.
[3509.02 → 3510.54] They mark everything that's wrong with it.
[3510.58 → 3513.80] And then, assuming they're small things, they'll send someone to come fix it.
[3513.80 → 3518.40] And if it's something big, you have to book an appointment with the service centre and bring it in.
[3518.40 → 3528.92] And so I tweeted saying, like, hey, the fact that this is, like, part of the procedure seems to indicate that this is a pretty well-known problem.
[3529.30 → 3539.54] Maybe the solution, instead of building a process where you fix things after the fact, would be to build a process where you identify and fix the things before the customer comes to get it.
[3539.54 → 3541.32] That seems like it would be prudent.
[3541.52 → 3546.66] Since you have to go through and find them and fix them anyway, why don't you do it ahead of time?
[3546.80 → 3548.96] That might make for a better customer experience.
[3549.04 → 3559.16] And I got my throat absolutely jumped down by Tesla fanboys that just were very unhappy with me.
[3559.36 → 3561.54] With the way that I treat Tesla so unfairly.
[3562.22 → 3563.72] And I apparently hate Tesla.
[3563.72 → 3565.20] I don't hate Tesla.
[3565.54 → 3570.40] I will just call an anti-consumer practice an anti-consumer practice where I see it.
[3570.86 → 3573.38] And I'm not a fan of anything.
[3574.26 → 3579.48] I don't like I have no emotional attachment to Mr. Musk or his company Tesla.
[3580.74 → 3583.36] He's a billionaire, and it's a company.
[3583.48 → 3584.84] That's all they really are to me.
[3584.90 → 3585.82] I've never met him.
[3587.76 → 3589.78] So I just I was like, look.
[3590.26 → 3593.02] And someone was like, why aren't you criticizing these other companies?
[3593.02 → 3595.24] Well, because I didn't buy a car from them.
[3595.62 → 3597.94] So what would I say exactly?
[3599.86 → 3602.82] How would I know what exactly the process is?
[3604.34 → 3606.26] Yeah, I saw that tweet.
[3607.24 → 3611.24] And I kind of shrugged and was like, yep, that sounds dumb.
[3611.70 → 3612.68] And then I moved on.
[3613.10 → 3617.50] And then someone mentioned to me that you were just getting berated.
[3617.68 → 3619.58] And I was like, what about what?
[3619.58 → 3621.92] And I jumped on that tweet again.
[3621.98 → 3623.16] It was just like, what?
[3624.86 → 3625.68] I don't know.
[3625.94 → 3632.42] I'm like as much of a Tesla fanboy without owning one as the next guy.
[3632.54 → 3634.12] But like there's a certain amount.
[3634.18 → 3635.90] You just have to kind of like.
[3635.90 → 3640.90] And it's not like what I said was wrong.
[3641.38 → 3641.90] Like to describe.
[3641.90 → 3642.88] No, that's the issue.
[3643.24 → 3651.78] Like Tesla's Tesla's culture is to, you know, overengineer some weird solution rather than just take the normal path.
[3651.80 → 3653.88] And that's part of what makes them so endearing to people.
[3653.88 → 3655.08] I get it.
[3655.08 → 3660.10] But if your roof is leaking, you should probably just fix the roof instead of.
[3660.40 → 3674.12] And the sort of the analogy that I made was, you know, if Tesla had a leaking roof in the Gigafactory, rather than just patching the roof, they would probably make a robot arm holding a pot that like moves it around and catches the drips as they fall.
[3674.58 → 3675.94] Like it's just extremely accurately.
[3676.32 → 3679.64] Every drip lands exactly in the middle of that bucket.
[3679.72 → 3680.08] Right.
[3680.34 → 3681.90] But that's a bad solution.
[3681.90 → 3688.00] Yeah, I like I'm I'm a rather notable Nintendo fanboy.
[3688.08 → 3692.20] I will pretty much auto buy any new thing that they release.
[3692.30 → 3693.46] That's like a major product.
[3694.08 → 3696.20] But you can still recognize when they're evil.
[3696.30 → 3696.90] Very cheap.
[3697.24 → 3700.12] And sometimes they do really dumb stuff.
[3701.50 → 3709.42] Like I think they're a little bit more lax with it these days, but they're they're super anti-like streaming stuff that they pushed for a long time.
[3709.42 → 3710.42] It's just ridiculous.
[3710.42 → 3712.42] They're dumb.
[3712.42 → 3713.62] They've done a lot of things that are really dumb.
[3713.68 → 3715.78] They've also done a ton of things that are really smart.
[3715.94 → 3716.22] Totally.
[3716.22 → 3717.18] And I respect them for.
[3717.92 → 3723.76] They're one of the few gaming companies that still seem to be aiming directly for fun as their main thing.
[3723.98 → 3724.20] Yeah.
[3724.88 → 3725.58] They're blah, blah, blah.
[3725.64 → 3726.40] I could go on more.
[3726.58 → 3726.82] But like.
[3726.94 → 3727.84] And they're so timeless.
[3728.10 → 3728.74] You have to be able to look at.
[3728.92 → 3729.22] Yes.
[3729.36 → 3729.76] My kids.
[3729.76 → 3732.76] You have to be able to look at and understand the flaws of the thing that you're a fan of.
[3732.76 → 3733.24] Yes.
[3733.28 → 3736.46] If you can't see the flaws in the thing you love, then you're blind.
[3737.78 → 3737.92] Yeah.
[3738.08 → 3738.88] And then you'll never.
[3739.02 → 3741.58] I think you will honestly like it.
[3743.58 → 3745.78] Maybe less is not the right metric.
[3745.78 → 3749.12] But not as fully, if that makes sense.
[3749.20 → 3749.30] Yeah.
[3749.34 → 3751.18] I think you need to learn to love the flaws.
[3752.00 → 3752.16] Yeah.
[3752.68 → 3753.02] Like.
[3753.02 → 3763.86] And then that way, like if someone attacks that thing that you like, instead of just freaking out and saying things that don't really mean anything or matter, you could just be like, yeah, I know.
[3764.02 → 3765.34] I remember having a really.
[3765.78 → 3780.50] I remember having a really stupid conversation once I was hanging out with some friends and I said something that somehow, you know, basically what it amounted to was that my wife is not the most beautiful woman on the planet.
[3781.14 → 3782.88] Basically was what I acknowledged.
[3783.38 → 3785.62] And it was like scandalous.
[3785.88 → 3786.54] It was shocking.
[3787.42 → 3799.92] And the female in this relationship said something to the tune of, well, you know, my significant other would always say that I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.
[3800.36 → 3801.88] And he said it.
[3802.12 → 3805.64] And I was like, good for you.
[3805.64 → 3811.08] But newsflash, neither you nor my wife are the most beautiful woman on the planet.
[3811.28 → 3812.48] And that's okay.
[3813.14 → 3816.62] Because I'm not the most handsome man on the planet either.
[3816.82 → 3821.50] And I don't need to live in a delusional dream state in order to enjoy my life.
[3821.50 → 3829.00] Like, I would rather have open and honest communication where, you know, I leave the dishes on the counter sometimes.
[3829.64 → 3831.04] And that's annoying.
[3831.04 → 3834.50] And my wife uses the wrong word sometimes.
[3834.50 → 3840.22] She'll describe it as the counter when she means the table and send me on an eight-minute wild goose chase looking for something.
[3840.38 → 3841.40] And that's annoying.
[3841.40 → 3846.80] And we can recognize each other's flaws and love each other anyway.
[3846.80 → 3849.42] That's the real endgame.
[3849.42 → 3856.12] And, you know, at some point, you all are going to get to the point where, you know, you can't live in that denial anymore.
[3856.12 → 3856.72] And then what?
[3857.38 → 3858.70] So that's my take on that.
[3858.92 → 3860.00] And I'm not backing down.
[3860.00 → 3865.08] Also, beauty is like a lame main metric to look for.
[3865.08 → 3878.58] There's a perfect song by a fascinating artist that goes something along the lines of like, maybe you're not as X, but you're probably better at Y, essentially.
[3878.86 → 3878.92] Yeah.
[3878.92 → 3880.66] Like, there's different.
[3880.90 → 3881.04] Yeah.
[3881.12 → 3882.24] Anyway, I don't know.
[3882.30 → 3887.16] It might be a little rude to point out in front of other people that you don't necessarily think so.
[3887.28 → 3890.24] Well, it wasn't like me just saying it for no reason.
[3890.24 → 3901.10] But like, basically, I, they were able to infer from what I was saying that that was how I felt.
[3901.66 → 3904.72] But it's like, like, what?
[3905.14 → 3908.36] Not everyone can be the most beautiful person on the planet.
[3908.36 → 3921.54] And quite frankly, you know, a lot of beautiful people have other utterly deal-breaking personality flaws that would make it so that I would be miserable if I had to hang out with them for more than three minutes at a time.
[3921.88 → 3926.14] If you are that, you probably spend so much time and energy being that.
[3927.56 → 3928.82] I don't want to generalize.
[3929.12 → 3931.38] Luke, let's not, let's not have to make apology videos.
[3931.56 → 3932.28] Let's generalize.
[3932.38 → 3932.84] Not at all.
[3933.00 → 3933.98] Let's move on.
[3933.98 → 3940.46] And let's, let's commit to each other that whenever we're about to walk into a trap, we just cut each other off.
[3940.56 → 3941.14] Just like that.
[3941.24 → 3941.66] I like it.
[3941.78 → 3943.32] So you got to do that for me, bro.
[3943.86 → 3944.26] Okay.
[3944.26 → 3944.76] I got you.
[3944.76 → 3947.66] You got to, you got to, you got to have my back in the future, bro.
[3948.00 → 3949.94] I'll be more decisive in the future.
[3950.06 → 3950.48] Thank you.
[3950.54 → 3951.78] You just talked over me.
[3952.16 → 3952.82] This is a flaw.
[3952.82 → 3957.00] This is something about our relationship.
[3957.18 → 3958.24] We need to work on Luke.
[3961.08 → 3961.48] Perfect.
[3962.92 → 3965.62] Tech link underscore UK says they're all watching this.
[3965.78 → 3965.94] Yes.
[3966.00 → 3968.78] All the most beautiful women in the world are watching this right now.
[3968.78 → 3970.76] And they're getting very upset.
[3971.34 → 3972.06] Very upset.
[3972.06 → 3973.22] That's all of you, of course.
[3973.22 → 3977.56] Oh, man.
[3977.72 → 3978.12] Okay.
[3978.32 → 3979.62] Is there anything else in the doc here?
[3979.72 → 3980.44] Oh, yeah.
[3980.74 → 3982.16] Promotion for the stream tomorrow.
[3982.28 → 3983.70] This is going to be super exciting.
[3984.04 → 3984.18] Yeah.
[3984.24 → 3984.48] What?
[3984.52 → 3987.90] It's the PC tech support challenge sponsored by Intel.
[3987.90 → 3997.80] It's going to be Jay's two cents versus Steve from Gamers Nexus in the tech support and troubleshooting challenge of their young lives and also Jay's life.
[3998.70 → 3999.38] Wow.
[3999.38 → 4008.68] We intentionally screwed up two PCs in an identical manner, and we sent them one to Jay, one to Steve.
[4009.00 → 4009.60] They have remained.
[4010.10 → 4010.34] Sorry.
[4011.06 → 4011.56] You did.
[4011.88 → 4012.14] Yeah.
[4013.06 → 4015.44] Like you're the one that screwed them up intentionally.
[4015.60 → 4016.08] No.
[4016.28 → 4018.78] Nicholas did it and Anthony helped.
[4019.34 → 4019.62] Okay.
[4019.84 → 4020.00] Yeah.
[4020.12 → 4021.18] So they are screwed up.
[4021.34 → 4022.52] They are royally screwed up.
[4022.52 → 4028.62] I went through the list of everything that is wrong with them, though, and I determined what would be the list.
[4028.70 → 4028.90] Yes.
[4029.38 → 4029.94] Okay.
[4030.08 → 4032.76] But I had other people do the actual work.
[4032.88 → 4033.10] Yes.
[4033.42 → 4034.48] Hashtag lie, Ness.
[4035.74 → 4041.02] So they are going to live on stream fix these machines.
[4041.14 → 4041.64] They are sealed.
[4041.98 → 4045.90] So they're going to unseal them and fix them and see who can do it fastest.
[4046.44 → 4047.46] It's all going to be live.
[4048.06 → 4053.54] And Austin and I are going to be co-hosting as the commentators for the stream.
[4053.54 → 4057.18] So Austin and I will both know everything that is wrong with the machines.
[4057.18 → 4058.74] We're going to have chat with these guys.
[4058.74 → 4063.24] We're going to be able to pipe into them and chat with them live.
[4063.36 → 4066.26] This is kind of, it's happening when LTX would have been.
[4066.26 → 4070.76] That's why we decided to do it on this date.
[4071.44 → 4075.78] So this is just kind of, it's been something for Chase, who's our event coordinator to work on.
[4075.78 → 4080.86] It's a collab, you know, something that we actually don't do enough of, probably.
[4080.86 → 4084.26] So it's kind of inspired by LTX in that sense.
[4084.74 → 4092.30] And to make it exciting for the viewers, we are going to be giving away the fixed systems as well as our example one.
[4092.40 → 4095.44] So I'm going to have one in front of me that is fixed.
[4095.50 → 4099.46] So that is perfect to make sure that they're, you know, doing it right.
[4099.54 → 4103.54] So we're giving away three systems each with a Core i7-10700K.
[4103.54 → 4115.24] Asus Z490 Maximus 12 Hero motherboard, a Sab rent 1TB SSD, an VGA RTX 2070 Super, 16GB of G-Skill Trident Z RGB memory, an Irwin 805 case,
[4115.36 → 4129.50] Sea sonic Prime TX 1000W power supply, View Sonic XG270QG gaming monitor, a Corsair KE95 RGB Platinum XT keyboard, M55 RGB Pro, M55, M55 RGB Pro mouse, and Void RGB Elite headset.
[4130.02 → 4131.66] These are freaking awesome rigs.
[4131.80 → 4132.60] Don't miss it.
[4132.60 → 4133.94] It's going to be a great stream.
[4134.16 → 4140.70] And it's going to be tomorrow, August 8th at 12 p.m. Pacific on YouTube, Twitch, and Float plane.
[4140.80 → 4144.70] We're expecting it to last for, I think it's going to take a couple of hours.
[4145.72 → 4146.16] Wow.
[4146.48 → 4147.58] So I'm really excited.
[4147.76 → 4154.94] And man, these guys are like, I don't think we could have picked better contestants because the will to win, man.
[4155.40 → 4155.84] Oh, yeah.
[4155.92 → 4159.64] The will to prove that the other is not as good.
[4160.04 → 4162.02] Oh, it's strong.
[4162.02 → 4163.74] It's strong with these two.
[4164.16 → 4165.48] Oh, yeah.
[4165.98 → 4167.00] I'm really excited.
[4167.34 → 4168.30] I'm just jazzed.
[4168.30 → 4169.58] And I can't wait to be ribbing them.
[4169.78 → 4172.24] Man, I'm going to interrupt Jay so much just for no reason.
[4173.08 → 4174.80] Just like, hey, Jay.
[4175.20 → 4175.64] You should.
[4175.86 → 4176.30] How's it going?
[4176.30 → 4178.80] You should just read out.
[4178.86 → 4180.02] Because you're in his ear.
[4180.12 → 4183.70] You should just read out, like, tweets that have just annoyed him.
[4184.58 → 4186.58] Oh, that would be so much fun.
[4186.84 → 4189.44] Just see if we can knock him off his game.
[4190.22 → 4190.46] Yeah.
[4190.46 → 4191.06] Oh, man.
[4191.26 → 4192.18] What could we do to mess with Steve?
[4192.18 → 4193.02] You got to find it.
[4193.40 → 4195.84] Yeah, I was just going to say, you have to find an equal thing.
[4195.84 → 4196.16] Yeah.
[4196.16 → 4198.62] I feel like Steve's just going to, like, tune me out.
[4199.14 → 4200.52] Kind of like how I tune him out.
[4201.00 → 4201.24] You know?
[4202.18 → 4203.14] Hey, got him.
[4203.34 → 4203.78] Got him.
[4203.82 → 4205.18] It's the roast is back, baby.
[4205.60 → 4206.70] The roast is back.
[4206.70 → 4213.12] I don't have a segue for this, but I feel like we're ending the show soon.
[4213.20 → 4216.70] And I want to make sure you do this because I saw this in the doc and I got extremely excited.
[4217.14 → 4218.20] You should announce your bounty.
[4218.90 → 4219.56] My bounty?
[4220.28 → 4220.94] Your bounty.
[4221.24 → 4222.94] I actually have no idea what you're talking about.
[4223.22 → 4226.78] I'm going to highlight it on the doc because I don't know if you've decided you don't want to say the name or not.
[4228.38 → 4228.58] Where is this?
[4228.58 → 4229.86] You should be able to scroll around and see what happened.
[4229.86 → 4230.48] Oh, there it is.
[4230.56 → 4231.30] Ah, yes.
[4231.56 → 4231.92] Okay.
[4231.92 → 4232.48] All right.
[4232.52 → 4233.52] Let's pop this up here.
[4234.28 → 4235.22] So cool.
[4235.22 → 4238.00] One of my writers came across this thing.
[4238.82 → 4239.66] So cool.
[4239.74 → 4251.70] This is the Mass Cool CSIS 8200 Black SCCC Thickness 1.0, which basically, this is just steel and a thickness of one millimetre.
[4252.14 → 4254.12] Like, this is just very, very bad specs.
[4254.48 → 4256.96] But it's something that has CC in it and its thickness.
[4256.96 → 4257.40] The thickness.
[4257.40 → 4265.72] So it's a mid-tower case with a 460-watt power supply and a built-in air conditioner.
[4267.22 → 4268.24] Yes, my friends.
[4269.00 → 4270.88] A built-in air conditioner.
[4272.00 → 4273.60] I am offering...
[4273.60 → 4276.82] So this worked so well last time for that curved Alienware monitor.
[4276.94 → 4279.28] We actually have one en route, is my understanding.
[4279.28 → 4284.18] I had to pay thousands of dollars for it because that was what I said I would do.
[4284.34 → 4285.10] But it's coming.
[4285.24 → 4287.02] So you guys need to watch that video.
[4287.52 → 4287.78] Okay?
[4288.28 → 4289.14] Help me out here.
[4289.84 → 4293.74] Please watch the video because otherwise I am losing so much money on that video.
[4293.88 → 4295.28] Please hook me up here.
[4295.84 → 4298.46] Anyway, it's a mid-tower case from roughly 2005.
[4298.46 → 4298.50] I just tried to flip it.
[4298.50 → 4299.32] I know I'll get it earlier.
[4300.44 → 4301.54] Roughly 2005.
[4301.54 → 4305.82] It has real-time temp and power monitoring in a panel up top.
[4306.04 → 4307.20] A built-in AC.
[4307.88 → 4308.68] I want one.
[4309.12 → 4310.48] I am offering...
[4310.48 → 4310.96] Let's see.
[4311.56 → 4313.54] I don't even know what this thing was worth when it was new.
[4314.16 → 4322.78] I'm offering $2,500 if you have a working one in good condition.
[4323.24 → 4326.12] $2,500 if you have one in good condition.
[4326.20 → 4327.06] I will buy it from you.
[4327.24 → 4327.76] Plus shipping.
[4328.34 → 4329.44] I will pay shipping as well.
[4329.44 → 4333.82] So hit me up and let's get a deal done.
[4333.86 → 4334.14] All right?
[4334.38 → 4336.96] I want the case with the built-in air conditioner.
[4338.64 → 4339.50] There you have it.
[4339.82 → 4340.90] Yvonne's going to freak out.
[4341.02 → 4342.60] She was like so upset.
[4342.72 → 4343.96] She was like, what do you mean $10,000?
[4344.68 → 4346.14] Why didn't you start at something lower?
[4346.96 → 4349.02] I'm like, well, because I didn't think anyone was going to have one.
[4349.52 → 4350.72] She's like, well, you should have thought of that.
[4350.76 → 4351.36] I'm like, well, I didn't.
[4353.60 → 4353.92] Okay.
[4353.92 → 4356.84] So the Mass Cool Next herm CS.
[4357.36 → 4357.92] I just want to...
[4357.92 → 4359.60] You want to double-check this for me?
[4359.98 → 4364.68] Mass Cool Next herm CS-ICS 8200.
[4367.14 → 4369.56] $79.99 in 2006.
[4369.90 → 4371.04] That's all it was worth, eh?
[4371.26 → 4371.70] All right.
[4372.54 → 4374.64] That doesn't seem right, but sure.
[4375.38 → 4375.92] You know what?
[4376.12 → 4377.52] That's going to be a great investment.
[4377.78 → 4378.36] Great investment.
[4379.36 → 4379.60] Yeah.
[4379.60 → 4384.34] There's a random, like, I'm building a second system and I want help with my parts list.
[4384.42 → 4385.70] And they list out their parts list.
[4386.36 → 4388.54] And that's in it and at that price.
[4388.76 → 4388.84] Okay.
[4388.92 → 4392.12] So it might have been some crazy deal.
[4392.42 → 4394.16] It might have been used.
[4394.50 → 4394.84] I don't know.
[4394.84 → 4397.86] I think it was because I've got a thread here from Tom's Hardware.
[4397.98 → 4398.98] March 2007.
[4399.44 → 4401.64] I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this case.
[4401.68 → 4403.60] It looks like a nice case with built-in AC.
[4404.48 → 4408.46] I've seen some reviews where you can get a CPU temp drop of 8 to 10C.
[4408.70 → 4411.56] And I was wondering if this is a good investment for $320.
[4413.00 → 4413.40] Okay.
[4413.40 → 4416.40] So that sounds more getting closer.
[4417.36 → 4417.62] It does.
[4417.80 → 4420.24] Maybe they got some weird deal on it or something.
[4420.40 → 4420.62] Yeah.
[4422.32 → 4422.72] Hilarious.
[4423.38 → 4423.66] All right.
[4423.70 → 4424.54] So hit me up, guys.
[4425.24 → 4426.64] Let's get through some super chats.
[4426.72 → 4428.34] And then I think that's it for the show today.
[4429.02 → 4434.68] One Who Doubts says, I've been following you daily for five years.
[4434.80 → 4437.68] Your content has given knowledge, entertainment, and inspired my career in IT.
[4437.84 → 4438.86] Wanted to say hi and thank you.
[4438.94 → 4440.14] No, thank you.
[4440.86 → 4441.62] Thank you.
[4441.62 → 4445.64] Corey Jensen says, Super Mario 64 got an unofficial PC port.
[4445.82 → 4446.76] That's great if you want to play it.
[4446.78 → 4447.82] I actually do want to play that.
[4449.48 → 4450.50] Nazi is the devil.
[4450.64 → 4452.58] You can use two controllers and Goldeneye for dual sticks.
[4452.74 → 4454.38] Can you really use two controllers and Goldeneye?
[4458.22 → 4459.30] That'd be hilarious.
[4460.26 → 4461.26] I didn't know that.
[4462.62 → 4466.36] Michael Raymond says, any chance we would ever get a giant sandal case mod?
[4466.82 → 4468.08] I mean, anything's possible.
[4468.08 → 4474.26] Michael Hand says, just make an Apple Cut subscription charge.
[4474.42 → 4476.36] Charge 30% more through Apple's payment API.
[4476.58 → 4478.94] No, you are like explicitly not allowed to do that.
[4479.70 → 4479.80] Yeah.
[4482.66 → 4484.32] Nadia says, number one fan.
[4484.32 → 4486.26] Thanks, Nadia.
[4486.26 → 4486.68] Are you?
[4487.08 → 4488.16] Thanks, Aquariums.
[4488.18 → 4489.20] Are you the number one fan in the world?
[4490.10 → 4490.92] The Eclipse.
[4490.96 → 4493.34] Are you the biggest fan in the world?
[4493.40 → 4494.76] I always make that joke.
[4495.42 → 4497.66] Whenever someone walks up, and they're like, I'm your biggest fan.
[4497.72 → 4499.32] I'm like, I've seen bigger ones.
[4500.70 → 4503.48] And then when they get confused, I'm like, no, no.
[4503.48 → 4505.10] I've seen like 300 pound fans, man.
[4505.24 → 4505.90] You're not the biggest.
[4505.90 → 4512.62] I mean, like the conversation you had earlier about like truthfulness.
[4512.94 → 4514.22] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4514.40 → 4516.06] Yeah, that's another one that drives me crazy.
[4516.30 → 4519.26] Entertainers that are like, I love you guys so much.
[4520.48 → 4521.26] No, you don't.
[4522.18 → 4522.76] You wouldn't.
[4523.04 → 4523.94] You don't know them.
[4524.16 → 4524.74] You don't.
[4524.74 → 4525.34] You wouldn't.
[4525.68 → 4528.32] You wouldn't shed a tear if they is one of them died.
[4528.44 → 4531.88] Like you don't have personal relationships with these people.
[4531.96 → 4532.78] Stop faking it.
[4532.78 → 4534.44] Just be honest.
[4534.68 → 4535.26] Be honest.
[4535.42 → 4536.20] You know, I love you.
[4536.20 → 4536.96] You can get there.
[4537.04 → 4541.44] I love you collectively as the group of people like this is how I feel.
[4541.52 → 4543.82] Like, you know, I love you collectively.
[4543.82 → 4550.08] And I appreciate like I have an emotional feeling from your support that, you know,
[4550.08 → 4555.46] allows me to do this incredible job that I get to do and work with the awesome team of people that I get to work with.
[4555.74 → 4557.64] But like, I'm not going to blow you kisses.
[4558.08 → 4559.10] Like, it's ridiculous.
[4561.66 → 4562.22] All right.
[4562.22 → 4565.08] The Eclipse Lock says, may I offer a challenge?
[4566.00 → 4570.48] Produce a video with a smartphone only and using equipment you recommend for the average watcher.
[4570.64 → 4572.38] Would it have great educational value?
[4572.44 → 4573.96] I mean, that's been done a hundred times.
[4574.02 → 4578.20] Like, all you need to do is like fire up your smartphone, like make a video.
[4578.20 → 4590.46] And that's such a like, like, you're going to have to put more limiters on there than you currently have because you can technically slap a super expensive big lens onto a phone.
[4590.94 → 4592.58] Like it is technically possible.
[4592.68 → 4593.64] People have done it before.
[4593.64 → 4597.60] I believe Casey Estate has a video about doing literally that.
[4598.60 → 4599.24] I, yeah.
[4600.92 → 4603.06] 225 Perfect says, have to issue a correction.
[4603.26 → 4605.52] Harmon didn't buy and shutter Athena Technologies.
[4605.70 → 4607.08] It was Vox who owns Kitsch.
[4607.80 → 4608.14] All right.
[4608.64 → 4609.26] There you go.
[4609.26 → 4612.00] Nadia says, re-TikTok.
[4612.12 → 4619.62] The problem is that it's impossible to really differentiate the inexperience of Chinese companies in developing secure software from malicious spying attempts.
[4620.26 → 4621.00] Yeah, that's fair.
[4622.36 → 4623.26] Malice or incompetence.
[4623.26 → 4624.54] That's pretty interesting.
[4624.68 → 4625.82] Real hard to tell the difference.
[4625.82 → 4633.60] Reddy Zhang says, there's actually apps or services for you to cross into China.
[4633.72 → 4635.70] We use it to mostly watch exclusive content.
[4635.82 → 4637.44] You must just be searching the wrong keywords.
[4637.56 → 4638.16] Yeah, definitely.
[4638.60 → 4639.18] A hundred percent.
[4639.18 → 4639.52] That's what you're saying.
[4639.86 → 4640.00] Yeah.
[4642.04 → 4644.60] Dominic says, thanks for keeping us going during COVID.
[4645.06 → 4645.98] Hey, no problem.
[4646.30 → 4647.36] Thanks for keeping watching.
[4648.06 → 4652.46] Robert Mail says, for non-Samsung phones, people can use SCRAPPY?
[4652.46 → 4656.38] It works on all Android phones without root and without even installing an app.
[4657.00 → 4657.60] Oh, interesting.
[4657.88 → 4660.76] I think Robert might be talking about like a multi-chat.
[4662.48 → 4665.64] Joseph says, the WAN show needs some ladies from time to time.
[4666.52 → 4667.44] Yeah, yeah.
[4667.62 → 4668.60] That's fair to say.
[4670.90 → 4672.18] Thanks, Joseph Taranto.
[4672.74 → 4675.16] Okay, we got like two, time for two more here.
[4675.28 → 4675.94] Time for two more.
[4676.54 → 4679.10] James Ryan says, you got me into tech at 12 years old.
[4679.34 → 4680.44] That was 10 years ago.
[4681.10 → 4682.34] Now I have a career in it.
[4682.46 → 4682.76] Wow.
[4683.66 → 4683.98] Crazy.
[4684.72 → 4685.34] Isn't that nuts?
[4685.96 → 4686.56] I feel old.
[4687.84 → 4691.62] Michael Penny says, I will give you 20 Australian dollars to blow kisses.
[4692.64 → 4693.32] Okay, fine.
[4693.44 → 4694.68] I guess I'll do anything for money.
[4695.82 → 4696.48] There you go.
[4696.78 → 4698.78] But I'm not going to say that it was sincere.
[4698.94 → 4700.04] I'm saying I did it for the money.
[4700.30 → 4701.24] You blow kisses from your palm?
[4702.08 → 4704.08] Well, I got a microphone right in front of...
[4704.08 → 4705.44] The microphone is like right here.
[4705.60 → 4706.66] So it was like kind of in the way.
[4708.52 → 4708.84] What?
[4708.90 → 4709.76] What does it matter?
[4709.76 → 4713.82] I mean, it's not like there's some science of blowing kisses.
[4714.10 → 4715.06] Like if you put them on the...
[4715.06 → 4718.76] I don't think I've seen any like damsel in a movie who blows a kiss go like...
[4719.38 → 4720.58] Like what?
[4720.62 → 4723.74] If you land them on your fingers, somehow they fly straighter.
[4723.98 → 4724.76] Like it...
[4725.56 → 4726.88] What are you even talking about?
[4726.88 → 4728.84] Yeah, but there's an accuracy bonus, dude.
[4728.90 → 4729.20] Come on.
[4729.24 → 4729.78] Who cares?
[4730.72 → 4732.76] You got to know the blowing kisses meta.
[4733.44 → 4733.86] All right.
[4733.88 → 4735.02] Well, that's enough.
[4735.10 → 4737.12] That's enough nonsense for me today.
[4737.24 → 4738.32] I'm going to go get some dinner.
[4738.44 → 4739.52] I am so hungry.
[4740.08 → 4740.86] All right, guys.
[4741.12 → 4741.98] Thanks for tuning in.
[4742.08 → 4744.92] Wish us luck with the App Store Gestapo.
[4746.22 → 4746.74] And...
[4746.74 → 4750.42] We have submitted a new version with some minor changes.
[4750.54 → 4751.76] So we'll see how that goes.
[4751.76 → 4753.76] Why don't we just submit a version that's...
[4753.76 → 4754.52] We submitted it during the show.
[4754.72 → 4758.34] Can we submit a version that's just absolutely nothing but like...
[4758.34 → 4758.92] It's a logo.
[4759.04 → 4759.54] Just like...
[4759.54 → 4762.86] Yeah, just an Apple logo with like I love Apple so much.
[4763.12 → 4764.58] Like just the love Apple app.
[4764.74 → 4765.46] Does that exist?
[4765.94 → 4767.04] Okay, can you actually...
[4767.04 → 4768.38] And then if you Donati code, you get into the app?
[4768.44 → 4771.06] Can you ask Jaden actually to create that app?
[4771.18 → 4772.88] Just like the love Apple app.
[4772.96 → 4776.16] It does nothing but just you press a button, and it just says, I love Apple.
[4776.16 → 4778.78] I bet they'd approve it.
[4779.14 → 4783.02] It should work with the like Apple payment system.
[4783.18 → 4787.42] And every time you press the Apple, it just like does a $1 payment.
[4787.84 → 4790.76] And then they take 30% of it, but we get 70% of it.
[4790.82 → 4792.70] Can you please create this app like immediately?
[4794.12 → 4797.00] I bet you Jaden could be done like tonight.
[4797.34 → 4800.08] I don't know if he'd even want to, but I'm sure he could.
[4800.38 → 4801.74] The love Apple app.
[4802.14 → 4806.14] It's just for people who love Apple, and they want to share like money.
[4806.14 → 4808.04] With other people who love Apple like us.
[4808.76 → 4814.30] Should we like keep it as genuinely truthfully hilly as possible?
[4814.58 → 4821.46] Or like every time you press the button, should it show like some tweet or something like that at the bottom temporarily?
[4821.66 → 4824.50] That's like someone having a terrible experience with Apple.
[4824.80 → 4825.08] No, no.
[4825.14 → 4826.80] It should be genuinely loving Apple.
[4827.32 → 4827.84] Okay.
[4828.04 → 4829.00] Nothing but love.
[4829.16 → 4831.52] Just like the give Apple money button.
[4833.08 → 4834.48] You know, like that.
[4834.64 → 4835.40] Just love.
[4835.40 → 4836.56] Purely love.
[4841.60 → 4844.44] Jaden has now checked in and has said, I'm on it.
[4847.98 → 4848.58] All right.
[4848.68 → 4849.96] WAN show next week, guys.
[4850.86 → 4853.28] Get ready for the love Apple app.
[4853.82 → 4860.32] Amber Leslie just dropped 100 British pounds in the super chat and didn't even leave a message.
[4861.06 → 4862.42] That's a weird thing to do.
[4862.42 → 4863.86] So there you go.
[4864.00 → 4866.02] They just want to share their love for YouTube.
[4866.66 → 4867.08] You know what?
[4867.20 → 4868.16] Here you go, YouTube.
[4868.62 → 4871.08] Here's 30% of my super chat or whatever.
[4873.24 → 4874.88] I love YouTube, too.
[4875.12 → 4875.42] All right.
[4875.54 → 4876.36] Good night, everyone.
[4876.78 → 4877.44] Have a wonderful.
[4877.70 → 4878.88] Have a wonderful weekend.
[4879.20 → 4880.64] I'll see you all next week.
[4880.74 → 4882.14] Oh, am I on my show next week?
[4882.18 → 4882.76] I might not be.
[4883.14 → 4883.90] Oh, that would be disappointing.
[4884.02 → 4884.32] Well, good.
[4884.40 → 4885.32] Jaden has two weeks then.
[4885.82 → 4887.68] I'll see you again whenever I'm back.
[4887.76 → 4888.38] Same bad time.
[4888.48 → 4889.18] Same bad channel.
[4889.96 → 4890.36] Bye.
[4892.26 → 4892.80] Oh, wait.
[4892.88 → 4897.40] So there's no way for me to stop the show from within the YouTube live-streaming thing any more then?
[4897.78 → 4900.06] Did they just get rid of that whole functionality?
[4900.56 → 4901.20] I guess so.
[4901.24 → 4902.26] Which is what we asked for.
[4902.32 → 4903.76] But then now I find this so confusing.
[4903.76 → 4904.74] All right.
[4904.90 → 4905.64] Stop streaming.
[4905.76 → 4906.68] Bye.
[4906.84 → 4907.50] Bye.
[4907.54 → 4908.68] Bye.
[4908.76 → 4908.78] Bye.
[4908.96 → 4909.24] Bye.
[4909.80 → 4910.96] Bye.
[4918.96 → 4919.92] Bye.
[4919.94 → 4920.68] Bye.
[4920.72 → 4921.02] Bye.
[4921.74 → 4921.88] Bye.
[4921.92 → 4922.40] Bye.
[4923.14 → 4923.46] Bye.
