[0.00 → 0.50] I'm not open.
[2.72 → 6.26] Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[6.64 → 8.42] We've got a fantastic show today.
[8.50 → 12.02] You can tell because Luke and I coordinated our outfits.
[12.58 → 13.56] I called him up this morning.
[13.64 → 17.06] I was like, hey, you're going to wear the float plane shirt today?
[17.58 → 18.66] Are you going to also wear blue jeans?
[18.82 → 21.74] And he was like, no.
[22.42 → 23.50] And I was like, okay, good.
[23.54 → 24.22] Then I can wear it.
[24.22 → 29.14] And then that piece of human garbage showed up wearing the float plane shirt.
[29.64 → 29.98] Wrecked.
[30.84 → 33.40] Are you wearing LTT underwear too?
[33.74 → 34.04] Yes.
[34.94 → 35.38] Nice.
[35.90 → 37.74] But I do that pretty much every time I can.
[38.66 → 39.50] LTTstore.com.
[39.62 → 40.54] We're the same underwear as us.
[40.86 → 41.22] That's right.
[42.64 → 44.52] Not literally the same.
[44.52 → 46.20] Not the same article of clothing.
[46.64 → 46.70] No.
[46.84 → 47.96] We charge more for that.
[50.88 → 52.08] Along with the bathwater.
[52.52 → 53.08] All right.
[53.08 → 54.62] So we've got a great show for you guys today.
[54.70 → 59.40] We're going to be talking about the PIA situation that took place a little back.
[59.40 → 62.80] Where PIA got acquired by Cape Technologies.
[62.80 → 71.50] I actually had a chance to sit down with some executives from both sides and sort of talk through some of our community's concerns.
[71.64 → 73.24] So we'll be discussing that a little bit later.
[73.78 → 79.38] Intel apparently is allegedly buying back stocks to hide declining growth.
[79.38 → 84.92] I mean there are other reasons to buy back stocks, but that's sort of one reason you might do it.
[85.24 → 85.72] What else we got?
[85.84 → 89.54] Xbox says Nintendo and Sony are no longer its main rivals.
[89.82 → 94.62] That'll be an interesting conversation and I do not agree with them, but we'll go more into that later.
[94.62 → 99.44] Also NVIDIA's GeForce Now is finally out of beta.
[100.48 → 101.90] Which is kind of cool.
[102.34 → 104.08] It's been in beta for a long time.
[104.10 → 104.40] Two years.
[104.64 → 106.04] It's like who do you think they are?
[106.10 → 106.32] Google?
[106.42 → 106.80] Flow plane?
[108.92 → 110.76] You know I wasn't even going home.
[111.14 → 113.20] Where I am going is into the intro.
[113.20 → 114.00] Flow.
[139.68 → 141.18] I'm surprised they still have like merch.
[141.18 → 147.86] Oh no these lip things are like my mother gave them to me when I still lived at home.
[148.46 → 150.18] And they still function.
[150.84 → 156.14] I mean it's mineral oil, you know beeswax, carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax.
[156.30 → 156.92] It's just like wax.
[156.92 → 158.04] Nothing that's going to rot.
[158.20 → 159.08] Yeah that makes sense.
[159.62 → 162.66] I mean maybe it rotted like I've been using it all that time.
[162.80 → 165.44] Like bits of skin flake could have rotted on it.
[166.66 → 169.68] But it doesn't say it expires, so I've just kept using them.
[170.12 → 170.40] Nice.
[170.40 → 171.40] Nice.
[171.40 → 172.40] Alright.
[172.40 → 175.00] So we've got a great show for you guys today as I said before.
[175.00 → 177.40] Let's get right into it.
[177.40 → 179.00] Are we starting headliner right?
[179.12 → 179.40] You know what?
[179.40 → 181.46] Let's go right to the headline topic.
[181.56 → 182.58] Private internet access.
[182.82 → 190.28] So I had a chance to sit down with, well virtually sit down with, you know air travel is costly
[190.28 → 192.46] and takes a lot of time and stuff.
[192.68 → 194.16] So we used discord.
[194.16 → 196.82] Unfortunately the audio was sort of terrible.
[196.82 → 197.44] You guys used discord?
[197.44 → 202.14] Well because they are in Europe so we were like on the Europe server, but I am super definitely
[202.14 → 205.32] not in Europe, and it was pretty crackly.
[205.44 → 206.36] I'm just, yeah sure.
[206.58 → 212.92] Anyway, point is I actually recorded the entire call with their permission of course.
[212.92 → 216.60] Like it wasn't, I wasn't surreptitiously recording it or anything like that.
[216.60 → 216.68] Yeah.
[216.68 → 217.42] I think this was the plan.
[217.42 → 222.72] But I recorded the entire call, and we're going to share that in an unlisted YouTube video
[222.72 → 226.60] if you guys want to go ahead and check that out.
[226.76 → 232.16] And basically what we did was we polled our community a little bit earlier, it was either
[232.16 → 237.48] this week or last week, and we asked you guys to give us a list of the questions that you
[237.48 → 239.30] wanted us to ask PIA.
[239.54 → 241.56] So I sat down, I talked to them myself.
[241.56 → 247.38] Some of the concerns that people shared were in this document that I cannot open because
[247.38 → 249.40] I opened the wrong one.
[249.40 → 251.02] Here we go.
[251.02 → 254.44] People wanted to know what kind of differences end users are going to see, how they can ensure
[254.44 → 261.28] their data is protected, whether PIA will remain private internet access, what guarantee
[261.28 → 265.34] people have that their information won't slip out in any shape or form, whether they'll
[265.34 → 270.92] continue to operate in such a way that they can maintain true confidentiality with no records,
[270.92 → 272.68] how does the merger help PIA?
[272.68 → 275.22] Why even do this?
[275.22 → 282.52] One of the things I really drilled into was, okay, I understand how this helps PIA because
[282.52 → 287.62] you have a bunch of money now because you've got this parent company with large coffers,
[287.62 → 295.02] but what's in it for Cape Technologies?
[295.02 → 299.80] It was said in the news articles about the acquisition that PIA owed a lot of money, that
[299.80 → 300.80] they had a lot of debt.
[300.80 → 305.56] And so I was looking at it going, okay, well, why does PIA have debt unless they're not profitable?
[305.56 → 310.64] And if they're not profitable, well, usually the model there for acquiring a non-profitable
[310.64 → 312.56] business is what are you acquiring?
[312.56 → 313.56] Users.
[313.56 → 316.28] Why do you want users?
[316.28 → 317.28] User data.
[317.28 → 319.18] So I asked, okay, like, how does that make sense?
[319.18 → 324.94] And they explained that basically the debt that PIA was carrying was actually more to
[324.94 → 330.86] do with product development of, you know, exciting upcoming products and not to do with that they
[330.86 → 333.32] were not operating profitably day by day.
[333.32 → 337.50] And I kind of went, okay, well, that makes a lot more sense acquiring a profitable business.
[337.50 → 342.32] So what else did we talk about?
[342.32 → 343.52] Will they be keeping IP records?
[343.52 → 344.82] The answer is no.
[344.82 → 349.50] What kind of auditing do they do of their systems to avoid what happened?
[349.50 → 354.68] Oh, actually, didn't ask that specifically because we ended up talking about the auditing
[354.68 → 356.30] that they are open to.
[356.30 → 360.86] So regulatory bodies are welcome to visit their offices.
[360.86 → 362.60] They can poke around in their source code.
[362.60 → 366.56] They've actually started open sourcing some of their products, which I thought was pretty
[366.56 → 368.46] cool.
[368.46 → 371.62] They say they're not planning any changes to the current end user license agreement.
[371.62 → 373.30] That was another big question.
[373.30 → 374.68] They couldn't really comment on pricing.
[374.68 → 375.68] I understand that.
[375.68 → 377.18] They were like, yeah, I don't know.
[377.18 → 381.56] Up, down, like pricing sort of a thing.
[381.56 → 382.56] Yeah.
[382.56 → 386.36] One of the most common questions, even though this happened a long time ago, like something
[386.36 → 392.10] like a year and a half ago was why did Marc Capella's become their new CTO?
[392.10 → 395.98] And we've actually got, we've got a clip.
[395.98 → 397.98] We've actually got a couple of clips here.
[397.98 → 399.36] So we've got about 11 minutes of highlights.
[399.36 → 401.36] I'm not going to take you guys through.
[401.36 → 402.36] Oh, whoops.
[402.36 → 403.36] You're not screen sharing with me.
[403.36 → 405.36] So we've got about 11 minutes of highlights here.
[405.36 → 407.70] I'm not going to take you guys through the whole thing, but I think it's worth including
[407.70 → 409.48] a little bit of it.
[409.48 → 416.86] The gist of that one was that London Trust Media hired Marc Capella's, and he wasn't actually
[416.86 → 420.86] influential on PIA, which is, was like owned by London Trust Media.
[420.86 → 423.86] But then now PIA was actually acquired by Cape Technologies.
[423.86 → 429.34] So, if anything, this question is more irrelevant now than ever, but they still were willing
[429.34 → 431.74] to answer it, which I thought was great.
[431.74 → 435.20] They were actually surprisingly approachable and transparent throughout the whole process.
[435.20 → 437.92] And they basically said, well, you know, we believe in second chances.
[437.92 → 444.34] You know, it's pretty evident that mistakes were made, but he never had any access to any
[444.34 → 447.32] user data and was working for London Trust Media.
[447.32 → 449.32] We know he's very capable.
[449.32 → 454.58] So, you know, we hired him based on that and one of PIA's founders had an existing relationship
[454.58 → 460.26] with him and kind of said, like, I know he's a good guy and like, you know, bad stuff happens,
[460.26 → 462.84] but we think people deserve a second chance.
[462.84 → 470.86] And he had nothing to do with any of PIA's privacy applications.
[470.86 → 474.94] So we had a pretty long conversation about that as well.
[474.94 → 475.94] Yeah.
[475.94 → 487.30] So basically, the long and short of it is that they're saying Cape Technologies made mistakes
[487.30 → 488.30] in the past.
[488.30 → 493.04] I mean, that was the other big concern that I think our users had been that Cape Technologies
[493.04 → 503.72] in its earlier days was whether directly or basically was in the business of selling user data,
[503.72 → 507.30] ended up having it blow up in their faces.
[507.30 → 515.14] The CEO, this is what they're telling me, the CEO basically burned it all to the ground,
[515.14 → 520.60] got rid of everybody, brought in an entirely new team and decided, okay, no, new focus.
[520.60 → 528.88] We are going to work on the concept of monetizing privacy instead of monetizing data.
[528.88 → 535.00] And they pointed at their acquisitions of other VPN companies who notably haven't had any scandals.
[535.00 → 541.30] CyberGhost is a perfect example in the last few years since Cape Technologies acquired them
[541.30 → 546.02] as their commitment to keep moving in that direction.
[546.02 → 554.22] Another interesting quip was they, I forget who it was, sorry, there were a handful of
[554.22 → 559.16] people on the call, but one of them pointed out that Mark Zuckerberg got up on stage and
[559.16 → 567.58] talked about privacy as a really exciting business opportunity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[567.58 → 571.78] And I'm kind of sitting here going, uh, okay.
[571.78 → 574.86] And they were like, yeah, yeah, no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong messenger.
[574.86 → 575.86] Yeah.
[575.86 → 576.86] Like great message.
[576.86 → 577.86] Sure.
[577.86 → 578.86] Yeah.
[578.86 → 579.86] That's fair.
[579.86 → 580.86] That's fair enough.
[580.86 → 581.86] Awkward.
[581.86 → 582.86] Yeah.
[582.86 → 584.86] Lie to your users a ton and then advertise privacy.
[584.86 → 585.86] Yeah.
[585.86 → 589.58] So, well, you know, that's the whole, it's the whole, I want to say conspiracy theory,
[589.58 → 590.86] but it seems pretty believable, right?
[590.86 → 596.86] You know where the, the same actors are creating, you know, uh, weapons and shields.
[596.86 → 597.26] Yeah.
[597.26 → 598.26] Yeah.
[598.26 → 599.26] Yeah.
[599.26 → 600.26] Right.
[600.26 → 601.46] Yeah, definitely.
[601.46 → 605.46] Um, are, are we going to watch it or are you just going to do the summary thing?
[605.46 → 606.46] You know what?
[606.46 → 607.74] I kind of summarized a lot of it.
[607.74 → 609.74] Why don't we, why don't we watch a couple of chunks of it though?
[609.74 → 610.74] Sure.
[610.74 → 611.74] Yep.
[611.74 → 613.74] Don't log.
[613.74 → 615.66] Do log just for our viewers.
[615.66 → 616.66] I want a summary.
[616.66 → 617.66] Do you log IP addresses?
[617.66 → 620.98] Do you log, uh, you know, any, like metadata?
[620.98 → 623.54] I mean, obviously you have to take payment from people somehow.
[623.54 → 625.42] Um, how does this work?
[625.42 → 629.14] What do you not log?
[629.14 → 633.42] So we do not log in any of our services, any IP translations.
[633.42 → 634.42] So we do not log.
[634.42 → 637.78] Sorry that the video is, uh, frozen on their side.
[637.78 → 638.78] The connection wasn't great.
[638.78 → 643.58] Technically is the user account because you need a user account to use a commercial VPN.
[643.58 → 650.18] Uh, that only shows that you use a VPN and not what you do with the VPN.
[650.18 → 651.18] And that is also shown.
[651.18 → 653.26] We are very transparent with them.
[653.26 → 659.10] I remember that private was the first company in the history of VPNs that opened and published
[659.10 → 662.38] a transparency report regarding police requests.
[662.38 → 666.58] And we get several police requests here, also private internet accesses, uh, releasing a
[666.58 → 667.58] transparency report.
[667.58 → 672.78] So you see in the way we deal with police requests and subpoenas that there is no data
[672.78 → 673.78] there.
[673.78 → 674.78] There is no data locked.
[674.78 → 675.78] There's no data locked.
[675.78 → 680.98] And maybe Andrew can tell a little bit more about, uh, how it's handled there.
[680.98 → 681.98] Absolutely.
[681.98 → 682.98] Yeah.
[682.98 → 685.10] I think that, uh, there's nothing necessarily about reporting anything, um, as it relates
[685.10 → 686.86] to VPN traffic or anything.
[686.86 → 692.14] Um, you know, obviously when somebody signs up, you know, somebody signs up, but, but,
[692.14 → 696.94] um, you know, we're really committed to our, uh, no law policy, but it's, it's, it's great
[696.94 → 701.62] that you, um, ask this question because we're actually taking it a step further and, and we're,
[701.62 → 708.46] um, opening our systems up to, um, you know, review for, from both auditors in the community
[708.46 → 713.74] and professional auditors as well so that they can verify what we're saying,
[713.82 → 714.70] not just take our reward.
[716.56 → 720.14] This is going to be a question that you guys...
[720.14 → 724.20] So basically, that's the summary of the no-log policy.
[724.72 → 728.26] Basically, they are committed to continuing to not log anything.
[729.04 → 729.32] Okay.
[730.18 → 733.54] I think my other timestamps are in the dock here.
[733.68 → 737.52] The big middle chunk, the only reason I'm not playing it is that it ended up being really long
[737.52 → 739.04] and it was faster to summarize it.
[739.74 → 745.72] I did post the full thing in the chat, and then I'm just checking to see.
[745.82 → 747.60] I believe it's also posted in the video description.
[747.84 → 748.00] Yep.
[748.72 → 751.08] It's posted in the video description if you guys want to check that out.
[752.56 → 754.24] I'm just checking my other timestamp.
[754.58 → 756.84] One completely off-topic question that I have.
[756.98 → 757.86] Are these guys in a tent?
[758.54 → 759.84] I don't know what they're doing.
[760.18 → 760.74] Are they camping?
[761.46 → 762.88] I'm not sure.
[763.04 → 763.52] I'm sorry.
[763.82 → 765.00] They were super backlit.
[765.12 → 766.08] It's hard to see their faces.
[766.08 → 772.34] Yeah, I mean, that answer was, as far as I know, the same answer you get if you look up there, like FAQ stuff.
[772.50 → 772.66] Yep.
[772.84 → 773.04] So.
[773.86 → 774.16] Did no?
[774.30 → 774.44] Hey.
[779.74 → 781.88] This was edited down for long pauses, apparently.
[783.10 → 784.02] Good effort, guys.
[784.30 → 786.62] You know, one thing I wanted to share is that we recently...
[786.62 → 788.44] Oh, I asked if there was anything else they wanted to share.
[788.70 → 790.74] ...of our software and, you know, we also...
[790.74 → 791.00] Okay.
[791.34 → 791.54] Yeah.
[791.60 → 792.36] Let's try that one more time.
[792.36 → 805.62] ...and we also announced a new program called Zero Access that, you know, I kind of briefly touched on it before.
[805.62 → 813.14] But we're basically, you know, opening up our systems to prove that we actually won't have access to the systems.
[813.14 → 818.18] But at the same time, they're running exactly what, you know, we're saying that is running.
[818.40 → 819.54] And it's all going to be provable.
[820.16 → 820.54] Okay.
[820.76 → 820.94] Yeah.
[820.94 → 825.36] The big push on our end is for complete transparency and visibility to our community.
[825.62 → 827.40] Someone had an iPhone sitting next to their mic.
[827.40 → 828.16] Okay.
[828.48 → 830.26] Well, go ahead.
[830.38 → 833.64] I have a small point on that one.
[834.48 → 836.62] A lot of questions are also in this direction.
[836.76 → 839.10] How can we guy trust you, you know?
[839.92 → 843.26] And my answer is always, don't trust us.
[843.96 → 845.28] I mean, just don't.
[845.76 → 847.20] Just look at what we are doing.
[848.54 → 850.16] We are publicly listed.
[850.58 → 853.12] We are the most transparent company out there.
[853.58 → 855.56] Everybody knows our headquarters.
[855.56 → 857.32] Go on our websites.
[857.46 → 860.08] You're going to see pictures of people working for these companies.
[860.66 → 863.24] So we are launching a transparency report.
[863.76 → 869.38] Our policy at CyberGoals is since three years, and it's the same policy at Private Internet Access or at ZenMate.
[869.98 → 875.92] Any NGO, any NGO that is in this field and has experts is invited.
[876.18 → 879.88] Knock at our doors in Bucharest or at the headquarters at PIA or at ZenMate.
[880.38 → 882.02] And you can have a watch.
[882.14 → 883.20] You can watch our service.
[883.32 → 884.12] You can see our service.
[884.12 → 885.72] You can look at our source code.
[886.24 → 887.64] You can see what's behind the scenes.
[887.72 → 888.60] You can talk with the people.
[889.52 → 890.62] We are super transparent.
[890.82 → 892.02] Don't trust us.
[892.06 → 894.08] Just look at how we operate the business.
[894.84 → 900.58] And to add additional trust now, we start to closely and slowly open source stuff.
[901.70 → 902.72] And I think that is important.
[902.84 → 908.88] I think that is the difference between us as a group and our product and any other VPN out there.
[908.88 → 909.48] Okay.
[909.48 → 909.88] Okay.
[909.88 → 910.48] All right.
[910.48 → 913.54] Thank you very much.
[913.54 → 925.32] So, in summary, what we've decided to do to make things simple.
[925.44 → 940.80] So, I don't know if you guys have noticed, but we worked with PIA for a long time, ever since we weren't comfortable with Tunnel Bears acquisition by McAfee, up until the news of PIA then getting acquired.
[940.80 → 946.76] Now, we haven't stopped working with PIA, strictly speaking.
[946.94 → 951.28] But ever since that day, we haven't done any promotion for PIA.
[951.48 → 954.42] We haven't put out our affiliate link.
[954.48 → 956.78] Actually, we had it in one spot.
[956.90 → 958.08] It was like in a template somewhere.
[958.22 → 960.66] But we removed it once someone brought that to our attention.
[960.66 → 968.88] Because we just, it wasn't that we were sure that Cape Technologies was going to be a negative influence on them.
[968.96 → 970.46] We just didn't know.
[970.68 → 977.72] And we didn't want to put ourselves in a position where, you know, PIA had got acquired.
[977.72 → 980.82] And then now we're hopping over to some other VPN.
[981.26 → 981.86] And then what?
[982.08 → 983.56] Like, are they going to get acquired?
[983.78 → 985.34] And then we have some big scandal.
[985.52 → 986.94] And then we hop over to some other VPN.
[987.14 → 990.96] And we were just kind of, I was tired of that cycle.
[991.22 → 992.58] You know, I don't want to deal with that.
[992.74 → 1001.68] And from my perspective, you know, if we couldn't just find someone that we can trust to recommend to our users, then I was just going to bail on it.
[1001.68 → 1008.74] So, what we told PIA is, look, we're going to give you guys a chance to speak your mind.
[1009.26 → 1010.84] We're going to let the community decide.
[1010.98 → 1016.34] I mean, everyone's had, like, weeks now, actually months to process all of this.
[1016.50 → 1022.12] So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop this poll in the forum here.
[1022.26 → 1023.28] Or in the forum, excuse me.
[1023.38 → 1025.04] I'm going to drop this poll in the chat here.
[1026.66 → 1028.64] And we're just going to let you guys decide.
[1028.64 → 1039.80] So, in order to prevent any exploiters from taking advantage of that this is a poll that's based on the YouTube community link,
[1040.20 → 1044.56] we are going to cut off the voting in the next five minutes.
[1044.68 → 1048.12] I'm not going to give people time to spin up their botnet or whatever the case may be.
[1048.84 → 1051.50] So, guys, go ahead and check that out.
[1051.82 → 1053.72] Do you want to drop that in the float plane chat as well?
[1054.68 → 1055.98] This guy's on it.
[1056.08 → 1056.82] He's on it.
[1056.82 → 1059.28] It's taking care of our float planers.
[1059.42 → 1062.64] I also re-upped on the other two just to make sure they got updated links.
[1062.86 → 1063.16] All right.
[1063.24 → 1065.04] So, guys, go check that out.
[1065.74 → 1068.14] And that's it.
[1068.34 → 1070.62] You guys are a judge, jury, and executioner.
[1070.72 → 1075.56] So, if you guys say, yeah, stick with PIA, then that's it.
[1075.68 → 1076.44] We're sticking with it.
[1076.48 → 1080.52] If you guys say, no, hard bail, then it's hard bail as far as I'm concerned.
[1080.66 → 1083.60] So, we'll do one more topic while we wait for you guys to go through that.
[1083.60 → 1085.08] And then we'll come back and have a look at the results.
[1086.32 → 1087.34] This is a fun one.
[1088.82 → 1091.62] This was posted by Jacob FW on the forum.
[1091.72 → 1094.36] The original source is seekingalpha.com.
[1094.82 → 1097.10] So, popular financial news site.
[1097.26 → 1099.94] Intel's stock has been trading near 20-year highs.
[1099.94 → 1106.76] However, Intel's annual 10K filing shows that the company's operations are running far behind the sentiment in the stock
[1106.76 → 1110.46] and that the earnings per share growth is being driven through stock buybacks.
[1110.56 → 1116.16] I mean, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's been following the tax changes
[1116.16 → 1119.68] that have been made down in the States over the last several years.
[1119.68 → 1127.40] Intel is far from the only company utilizing its windfall from not paying as many taxes
[1127.40 → 1131.68] to buy back a bunch of its stock and pump up the value.
[1132.42 → 1134.88] Although, there may be more to this.
[1134.92 → 1136.18] So, let's go through the rest of this.
[1136.24 → 1140.14] So, the driver of Intel's story in the recent past has been its data centre group.
[1140.58 → 1142.58] But this segment barely grew in 2019.
[1142.58 → 1147.00] Could be partly because of AMD EPIC 2 Roam servers.
[1149.10 → 1154.26] And their profitability actually declined by over 10% the first year EPIC shipped in decent volumes.
[1154.52 → 1156.90] So, yes, that is probably a factor.
[1156.90 → 1163.44] And if the last few months ever since Roam 2 in particular are anything to go by
[1163.44 → 1167.20] in terms of third-party reviews and just the buzz that I've seen
[1167.20 → 1169.92] in the places where people are discussing enterprise hardware,
[1169.92 → 1174.34] ooh, 2020 is not going to be a good year for that unit.
[1174.80 → 1177.54] So, the other major group at Intel is the client computing group.
[1177.68 → 1182.20] So, that's where you've got your K-series overclocking, you know, gaming CPUs,
[1182.22 → 1182.98] all that kind of thing.
[1183.32 → 1185.48] And growth in 2019 also died down.
[1186.28 → 1191.50] AMD has been consistently gaining market share against the client computing group
[1191.50 → 1193.74] ever since basically the launch of Ry zen.
[1194.14 → 1199.24] I mean, it's at the point now where, here, all we have to do is fire up Amazon.com
[1199.24 → 1200.52] Yeah.
[1201.02 → 1202.68] I mean, check this out, ladies and gentlemen.
[1202.90 → 1206.48] This is not pre-scripted, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
[1206.98 → 1210.34] We're going to look at, I don't even know how to navigate Amazon's site.
[1210.52 → 1210.72] It's terrible.
[1210.96 → 1211.48] You pass computers.
[1211.60 → 1211.96] It's terrible.
[1213.00 → 1213.36] Computers.
[1213.44 → 1214.28] Yeah, but it's not computers.
[1214.40 → 1215.62] I need, ah, computer components.
[1215.82 → 1216.82] Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1217.68 → 1219.06] We need computer components.
[1219.14 → 1219.56] Well, whatever.
[1219.70 → 1220.44] Here you go.
[1220.44 → 1221.20] Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1221.28 → 1221.86] Here you go.
[1222.92 → 1223.16] AMD.
[1224.02 → 1224.74] Some more AMD.
[1225.34 → 1226.32] Best seller.
[1226.74 → 1227.02] AMD.
[1227.02 → 1228.80] Some more AMD.
[1230.00 → 1231.28] That's red, but not AMD.
[1231.42 → 1232.08] But hey, it's red.
[1232.18 → 1232.94] You know, it counts.
[1233.28 → 1233.90] More AMD.
[1235.24 → 1236.14] Holy crap.
[1236.48 → 1237.44] That's actually...
[1237.44 → 1237.70] AMD board.
[1237.82 → 1238.50] AMD board.
[1238.72 → 1239.60] AMD processor.
[1239.80 → 1240.46] AMD board.
[1240.56 → 1243.50] There isn't a single Intel thing on the landing page.
[1243.86 → 1244.60] That's actually crazy.
[1244.60 → 1255.80] Now, you know, if I wore a tinfoil hat, I might suggest that Amazon is, you know, Lisa Sue's niece is working for Amazon and making sure...
[1255.80 → 1256.76] No, that's...
[1256.76 → 1259.06] Amazon is algorithmically driven.
[1259.06 → 1266.32] I can tell you for a fact that if it's AMD all over the computer components front page, that's because that's what people are...
[1267.32 → 1272.16] Even if they're not necessarily buying it, you know, every single one of those products.
[1272.28 → 1274.58] Like, Intel's definitely still selling CPUs.
[1274.84 → 1278.02] But even if they aren't necessarily buying it, that's what people are shopping for.
[1278.10 → 1280.80] That's what people are, like, lusting after right now.
[1280.80 → 1282.80] So, um...
[1282.80 → 1283.06] Wait.
[1283.92 → 1284.26] Oh, no.
[1284.36 → 1284.70] Never mind.
[1284.80 → 1291.74] I thought I saw an Intel product on the homepage, but actually that was just something that I had in my cart as, like, a thinking about item.
[1291.74 → 1296.20] So, I sorted to specifically CPU processors.
[1297.38 → 1301.74] And there's Intel stuff right on the front, but you'll...
[1301.74 → 1302.62] Hold on.
[1302.84 → 1303.18] Here we go.
[1303.46 → 1303.88] What do you get?
[1303.92 → 1304.44] What do you get here?
[1304.62 → 1306.40] What do you expect there to be in the middle top?
[1306.50 → 1307.00] Oh, boy.
[1307.10 → 1308.92] What the heck is that doing there?
[1309.18 → 1310.16] Why is that there?
[1310.16 → 1311.04] Why is it $500?
[1311.36 → 1312.56] Why is there an Athlon XP?
[1312.70 → 1313.86] What are these sponsored...
[1313.86 → 1315.22] Who is sponsoring this?
[1315.76 → 1317.34] We need more transparency!
[1317.88 → 1319.08] What's going on here?
[1319.68 → 1321.04] Once you move past the really...
[1321.04 → 1322.46] No, I've gone back in time!
[1323.12 → 1325.86] It's Athlon XP versus Core 2 Quad!
[1326.32 → 1328.54] Well, that's going to be a gong show.
[1328.54 → 1332.62] Once you get past the sponsored ones, however, it's AMD land.
[1333.30 → 1334.54] It takes, what...
[1335.98 → 1339.62] Seven, sort of eight?
[1339.62 → 1342.78] Because there's randomly an SSD in here until you get to an Intel processor.
[1342.78 → 1343.46] Okay, hold on.
[1343.58 → 1347.34] I had a viewer ask me to do it in incognito mode.
[1347.50 → 1347.92] Oh, okay.
[1348.14 → 1351.04] Friends, I always do it in incognito mode.
[1351.36 → 1352.78] So, this is computers...
[1352.78 → 1353.92] Don't just...
[1353.92 → 1354.38] Go away.
[1354.94 → 1355.78] Computer components.
[1355.86 → 1356.22] Here we go.
[1356.34 → 1356.64] All right.
[1356.86 → 1357.86] Are we ready, ladies and gentlemen?
[1358.48 → 1358.80] AMD.
[1359.06 → 1359.72] AMD, AMD.
[1359.94 → 1360.64] This is identical.
[1360.72 → 1361.00] AMD.
[1361.68 → 1361.92] AMD.
[1361.92 → 1362.44] AMD.
[1362.44 → 1367.02] Yeah, I actually don't really shop on Amazon.com very much, so I might as well be loading it
[1367.02 → 1367.94] in incognito mode.
[1368.32 → 1369.56] Oh, I also went to .ca.
[1369.80 → 1370.30] Oh, okay.
[1371.02 → 1372.08] That was .ca.
[1372.20 → 1372.64] Oh, okay.
[1372.70 → 1373.38] What I showed you guys.
[1373.38 → 1375.08] But you ended up with a couple Intel processors.
[1375.26 → 1375.58] Well...
[1375.58 → 1377.68] Oh, but that was when you went to the CPU page specifically.
[1377.90 → 1378.10] Oh, wow.
[1378.10 → 1378.96] Went to the CPU page.
[1379.24 → 1383.24] After the sponsored posts, it's all Ry zen for two whole rows.
[1383.44 → 1383.54] Wow.
[1383.54 → 1386.54] And then in the third row, the third item is an Intel processor.
[1386.54 → 1389.82] And then you got like an SSD in there because like you only live once.
[1389.86 → 1392.88] So, there's an SSD beating Intel's first entry.
[1393.12 → 1393.42] Yes.
[1394.32 → 1394.86] That's rough.
[1394.86 → 1397.78] And they get two entries, and it's all back to AMD for three more and then back to...
[1397.78 → 1398.22] AMD town.
[1399.36 → 1399.80] Oof.
[1400.44 → 1401.50] Population, you all.
[1401.82 → 1402.14] Oof.
[1402.86 → 1403.58] All right.
[1403.58 → 1405.54] So, what else we got here?
[1405.92 → 1410.38] Growth would have been negative if not for adjacent business, a segment that included
[1410.38 → 1414.14] the Apple modem business, which saw a major growth spurt in 2019.
[1415.24 → 1419.74] So, Intel is posting increased earnings per share despite the declining operating income.
[1420.22 → 1421.32] How is this possible?
[1421.96 → 1429.64] Stock repurchases have climbed from $3.615 billion to $10.73 billion in 2018 to...
[1429.64 → 1429.98] Oh, sorry.
[1429.98 → 1436.34] That was 2017 to 2018 to $13.576 billion in 2019.
[1437.44 → 1441.82] So, some may argue that Intel is continuing to generate tremendous amounts of cash despite
[1441.82 → 1444.04] the challenges and there's nothing wrong with stock buybacks.
[1444.24 → 1447.56] In fact, it can be a sign that the executives are confident that stock price will go up in
[1447.56 → 1447.96] the future.
[1449.74 → 1451.32] The argument is a little flawed though.
[1451.38 → 1454.42] The main problem is not stock buybacks, but that the buybacks are hiding the declining
[1454.42 → 1455.40] operational performance.
[1455.40 → 1456.26] So, I read this.
[1456.34 → 1458.92] I don't think that the argument is necessarily flawed.
[1459.28 → 1459.68] Right.
[1459.68 → 1460.82] Because they're saying...
[1460.82 → 1467.92] Some may argue that they're getting a bunch of cash and there's nothing wrong with stock
[1467.92 → 1468.36] buybacks.
[1468.68 → 1473.10] Then, the next statement is saying that the argument is flawed, which would mean that there
[1473.10 → 1474.76] is something wrong with stock buybacks.
[1475.26 → 1479.04] Well, there can be, I think is what they're trying to say.
[1479.04 → 1480.18] Like, they...
[1480.18 → 1482.70] Sure, but that's a weird statement.
[1482.82 → 1484.04] So, if you're doing stock...
[1485.56 → 1487.52] I can try to get that turned back on.
[1488.44 → 1490.56] Did we just have, like, a power flicker here?
[1491.70 → 1493.62] I hear a printer turning back on.
[1493.72 → 1493.88] Yeah.
[1495.16 → 1495.60] Okay.
[1495.74 → 1496.26] No, it's fine.
[1496.40 → 1497.54] Oh, actually, yeah.
[1497.54 → 1498.58] I can keep going.
[1498.90 → 1499.56] Oh, okay.
[1499.82 → 1499.98] Yeah.
[1500.32 → 1501.42] Let's just both leave.
[1501.60 → 1502.00] Okay.
[1506.32 → 1507.24] I'm going to come back.
[1508.24 → 1508.68] Hello?
[1509.04 → 1509.60] Yeah.
[1509.90 → 1510.30] Yeah.
[1510.46 → 1511.36] So, I don't know.
[1511.66 → 1512.74] I was...
[1512.74 → 1517.82] We praised Ubisoft, what, like, two years ago when they resisted a company buying them
[1517.82 → 1520.72] out by frantically buying as much stock as they could?
[1520.74 → 1520.98] Yeah, that's true.
[1521.32 → 1524.26] I don't think buying back stock is necessarily a bad thing.
[1524.96 → 1530.14] They could definitely be using it to cover up declining whatever's, but if you're making
[1530.14 → 1534.96] stock purchasing decisions, and you're looking that shallowly at things, like, eh.
[1535.94 → 1536.86] That's not...
[1536.86 → 1537.12] No.
[1537.12 → 1540.04] No, you have to protect the lowest common denominator.
[1540.82 → 1541.22] 100%.
[1541.22 → 1542.90] I don't do stock stuff very often, so...
[1542.90 → 1543.10] Okay.
[1543.18 → 1544.24] No, what I mean by protect...
[1544.24 → 1546.22] I mean protect the lowest common denominator person.
[1546.60 → 1547.20] That's what I thought you meant.
[1547.20 → 1547.58] Oh, yeah.
[1547.68 → 1547.80] No.
[1547.88 → 1549.62] So, like, that's why...
[1549.62 → 1550.76] I'm including myself in that section.
[1550.76 → 1551.32] Oh, I see.
[1551.40 → 1551.58] I see.
[1551.68 → 1551.82] I see.
[1551.82 → 1552.82] Because I don't...
[1552.82 → 1554.02] I'm not super informed on stock stuff.
[1554.02 → 1554.22] Okay.
[1554.30 → 1555.60] But lowest common denominator...
[1555.60 → 1558.40] No, I would not consider you to be the lowest common denominator.
[1558.82 → 1564.38] Lowest common denominator is more referring to the capability or the like...
[1564.38 → 1564.58] Okay.
[1564.66 → 1568.20] Or the like, the methodology that someone might use to approach something.
[1568.32 → 1568.56] Okay.
[1568.74 → 1569.02] You know?
[1569.12 → 1572.00] And you have to make sure that you're protecting the people...
[1572.00 → 1574.46] So you're protecting, like, stock do good, buy stock?
[1575.02 → 1575.42] Yeah.
[1575.58 → 1581.10] Like, people who are like that because they need to know that something's being manipulated.
[1581.10 → 1584.82] But you also can't stop a company from buying back their stock because of...
[1584.82 → 1584.96] No.
[1585.54 → 1590.78] Another thing, too, is that, you know, if the executives own a bunch of stock...
[1590.78 → 1593.64] If the stock is dipping, this might be a good time for them to buy...
[1593.64 → 1593.82] Buy back.
[1593.82 → 1595.12] If they think it's going to come back eventually.
[1595.12 → 1601.82] Or buy back so that the stock doesn't dip too far so they can sell theirs for a good value.
[1601.82 → 1604.46] Before it, everyone clues in and it, like, really dips.
[1604.76 → 1605.48] That also makes sense.
[1605.60 → 1607.38] So, um...
[1607.38 → 1608.14] Anyway.
[1608.40 → 1615.36] I could see why someone could maybe argue that it's, like, not a great thing that they're covering up the stock dipping.
[1615.58 → 1616.60] Totally understand that.
[1616.96 → 1618.48] I don't...
[1618.48 → 1621.64] I wouldn't agree that they, like, shouldn't be allowed to do it or something.
[1622.20 → 1623.68] Because it's fair.
[1623.68 → 1627.30] I mean, this is obviously not something that would work for the very long term.
[1627.56 → 1630.94] You know, eventually you run out of cash to buy back stock.
[1630.94 → 1632.02] Especially with this increase.
[1632.18 → 1634.50] Like, the first year's increase was over $7 billion.
[1635.10 → 1635.36] Yep.
[1635.54 → 1638.64] And then the next one was, what, like, around just under $3 billion.
[1638.84 → 1644.58] But, I mean, I would be very surprised if Intel doesn't come back swinging hard in the next two to four years.
[1644.76 → 1649.28] And maybe this helps them ride out that dip.
[1649.70 → 1649.88] Yeah.
[1649.88 → 1650.48] Yeah.
[1650.66 → 1651.20] Um, alright.
[1651.36 → 1657.44] Speaking of riding, let's go ahead and have a look at the results of our pool here.
[1657.62 → 1658.46] Ah, and then sponsors.
[1658.72 → 1659.82] And then sponsors, right?
[1659.94 → 1660.20] Yes.
[1660.32 → 1660.92] We should do that.
[1661.66 → 1662.04] Alright.
[1662.52 → 1664.52] You guys are finding out at the same time as me.
[1665.16 → 1665.60] What's up?
[1665.60 → 1667.46] I've updated a few times since it's been tied every time.
[1667.68 → 1667.88] Yep.
[1667.88 → 1667.96] Yep.
[1667.96 → 1671.96] Okay.
[1674.24 → 1674.64] Internet.
[1675.18 → 1676.32] So are we being trolled?
[1676.48 → 1677.80] Are we being trolled, Colton?
[1677.84 → 1678.92] I don't think we're being trolled.
[1678.94 → 1680.08] You don't think we're being trolled?
[1680.32 → 1681.48] The community thinks.
[1681.60 → 1683.52] It's just, it's a tough call.
[1683.90 → 1685.60] They think small one, big one, small one.
[1685.60 → 1686.04] Yeah.
[1686.96 → 1690.62] It really does look like a middle finger, doesn't it?
[1691.10 → 1691.58] Yes.
[1691.78 → 1692.20] Yes.
[1692.32 → 1693.44] That's what you were thinking.
[1693.68 → 1693.78] Yep.
[1693.78 → 1696.06] That's what you see when you look at that.
[1696.12 → 1696.34] Yep.
[1696.56 → 1697.80] A long, hard, middle finger.
[1697.80 → 1699.72] Just a gigantic indifferent.
[1702.02 → 1703.98] I'm making this decision for you.
[1705.86 → 1706.42] Alright.
[1706.88 → 1708.44] Let's give it the old refresh.
[1709.74 → 1714.70] I mean, this is not going to get more helpful.
[1715.10 → 1719.60] And for your reference, I did refresh it a few times and they were tied every time.
[1719.94 → 1722.16] The indifference column got a little smaller.
[1722.16 → 1724.44] So I think the excitement about the poll decreased.
[1724.78 → 1728.82] But the yes and no columns were tied the whole time.
[1728.90 → 1732.70] I was really hoping for a much clearer indicator.
[1732.86 → 1737.06] I mean, I might as well have just gotten a magic eight-ball and been like, yo, what should I do?
[1737.52 → 1737.96] Sub.
[1738.92 → 1739.32] Maybe.
[1739.94 → 1741.80] Future outlook not so good, you know?
[1742.02 → 1742.22] Yeah.
[1742.46 → 1742.60] Yeah.
[1745.50 → 1745.98] Okay.
[1748.38 → 1749.46] Well, now what?
[1749.46 → 1751.48] Should we just take it offline and figure it out?
[1751.48 → 1752.70] There's a winner.
[1752.90 → 1753.62] You have to refresh.
[1753.84 → 1754.34] There's a winner?
[1755.26 → 1755.62] Okay.
[1756.16 → 1761.50] I mean, I don't know that I would necessarily consider 1% to be a winner.
[1763.78 → 1764.14] Yeah.
[1765.46 → 1766.24] It's meaningless.
[1766.70 → 1766.84] Yeah.
[1766.84 → 1774.42] This is like clearly, this is clearly divided, divided the community here.
[1774.72 → 1776.10] I think we need to put more thought into it.
[1776.50 → 1776.88] All right.
[1776.94 → 1777.48] What do you think?
[1777.58 → 1779.20] Are you, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
[1779.26 → 1779.58] What do you think?
[1779.82 → 1780.20] I have.
[1780.26 → 1782.02] You guys should like rap battle each side.
[1782.02 → 1788.30] Honestly, having, having actually sat through the entire interview that I did with them
[1788.30 → 1792.90] this morning, I felt pretty good about the direction they were going.
[1792.90 → 1799.60] Um, I mean, I'm still committed to letting the community decide.
[1799.76 → 1804.22] Unfortunately, I don't have a good way to allow them to decide at this point.
[1804.22 → 1804.88] What if you remove indifferent?
[1805.24 → 1808.50] Without leaving it open to, well, people.
[1808.68 → 1809.24] You have to redo it.
[1809.32 → 1810.94] And some people are legitimately indifferent.
[1811.08 → 1811.34] Yeah.
[1811.46 → 1813.02] No, I don't want to take away that vote.
[1813.06 → 1814.92] If people just don't care, like that's good to know.
[1814.92 → 1821.28] But the difference between the 22 and the 23 will be more noticeable if that column of
[1821.28 → 1822.24] dump votes isn't there.
[1822.52 → 1823.82] I see.
[1824.20 → 1824.46] Okay.
[1826.30 → 1829.70] I mean, it might end up being like, oh, it's a 2% difference now.
[1829.82 → 1831.80] Like it might not be meaningful.
[1831.96 → 1834.12] I was expecting like a landslide in either direction.
[1834.20 → 1835.26] I was too, to be honest.
[1835.26 → 1838.10] I was expecting there to be strong opinions.
[1838.28 → 1839.80] I didn't know which way it would swing.
[1839.90 → 1843.22] This was the last possible thing that I could have expected.
[1843.46 → 1843.60] Yep.
[1843.80 → 1844.14] Me too.
[1844.14 → 1845.10] Okay.
[1845.18 → 1846.54] We're going to have to give it some more thought.
[1846.62 → 1848.02] This was like my master plan.
[1848.42 → 1848.98] This was my.
[1849.20 → 1849.98] I thought it was going to work.
[1850.14 → 1854.06] I was like excited for like how conclusive this was going to be.
[1854.20 → 1854.28] Yeah.
[1854.94 → 1857.46] I was excited to not have to make a decision.
[1858.68 → 1859.08] Honestly.
[1860.10 → 1861.44] The community was just like, no.
[1862.14 → 1863.24] This is on you.
[1863.34 → 1863.54] Yeah.
[1865.68 → 1866.04] So.
[1866.64 → 1867.88] You have to decide.
[1868.80 → 1870.36] Got people saying NordVPN.
[1870.68 → 1871.84] They've had their own issues.
[1871.84 → 1873.18] Like right around the same time.
[1873.18 → 1874.54] They had a really stupid scandal.
[1874.54 → 1875.86] Was it right before I think?
[1876.06 → 1876.30] Yeah.
[1876.64 → 1876.82] Yeah.
[1876.82 → 1878.76] All right.
[1879.22 → 1883.14] I guess we'll just have to figure it out on our own then.
[1883.28 → 1885.58] Go watch the unlisted video.
[1885.76 → 1885.94] Yeah.
[1886.02 → 1887.12] Go watch the unlisted video.
[1887.28 → 1888.44] See if you feel any differently.
[1888.58 → 1892.06] Honestly, I'm not going to be able to keep looking at these numbers though because the
[1892.06 → 1896.10] longer this sits up there, the easier it would be for someone to go in and try to manipulate
[1896.10 → 1899.14] it with a bunch of zombie accounts or whatever the case may be.
[1899.14 → 1899.40] So.
[1899.60 → 1901.54] I was actually just going to say, do I leave the poll up?
[1901.74 → 1901.80] Just.
[1901.94 → 1904.18] You can leave it up just for loss, I guess.
[1904.42 → 1904.80] Um.
[1905.72 → 1906.46] I don't know.
[1907.40 → 1907.72] No.
[1907.92 → 1908.72] Just lock it.
[1908.80 → 1909.12] Okay.
[1909.54 → 1909.90] Yeah.
[1910.04 → 1910.48] I'm just going.
[1910.58 → 1910.82] No.
[1910.96 → 1911.34] It's okay.
[1911.40 → 1911.64] I can.
[1911.64 → 1912.70] I think I can lock it.
[1913.18 → 1914.34] You do have the power.
[1914.42 → 1915.86] Do I have the power to lock it?
[1915.94 → 1916.04] No.
[1916.08 → 1916.72] I can only delete it.
[1916.74 → 1917.70] You can't lock a poll.
[1917.76 → 1917.96] Yeah.
[1917.96 → 1918.56] You can delete it.
[1918.74 → 1921.96] What a feature rich, wonderful website, YouTube.
[1922.22 → 1925.90] Thank you very much for building this spectacular video.
[1925.90 → 1926.92] I didn't even know it existed.
[1926.92 → 1927.66] Just let it go.
[1927.82 → 1928.78] You can get polls on YouTube.
[1928.78 → 1930.54] Video sharing platform.
[1931.02 → 1931.36] Um.
[1931.36 → 1931.76] You said that, Nick?
[1932.02 → 1932.18] Yeah.
[1932.42 → 1932.76] Oh yeah.
[1932.88 → 1933.32] Yeah, Nick.
[1933.84 → 1934.04] Um.
[1934.04 → 1934.30] Hey, Jayden.
[1934.50 → 1935.32] When's it coming, dude?
[1935.72 → 1936.04] Yeah.
[1937.16 → 1937.86] All right.
[1938.56 → 1938.74] Okay.
[1939.24 → 1939.74] It's not even.
[1939.82 → 1940.02] It's not.
[1940.08 → 1941.34] It's literally his own thing.
[1941.42 → 1942.20] I'm deleting it.
[1942.32 → 1943.64] He just has like this amazing.
[1943.84 → 1944.14] Yeah.
[1945.12 → 1945.98] Come on, Jayden.
[1946.12 → 1946.50] All right.
[1946.56 → 1947.24] Get the dust off.
[1947.24 → 1947.56] Screw it.
[1947.56 → 1947.98] Let's do.
[1948.22 → 1948.74] Let's do our.
[1948.82 → 1949.50] Let's do our sponsors.
[1950.74 → 1954.98] Oh, I'm so unhappy right now because I was just expecting that to be the answer.
[1955.18 → 1955.38] Okay.
[1955.50 → 1957.30] Today by Squarespace.
[1957.30 → 1959.00] Don't worry.
[1959.16 → 1960.52] The space doesn't have to be square.
[1960.88 → 1963.38] It can be any form of rectangle you want.
[1963.52 → 1963.84] Oh.
[1964.02 → 1965.36] Phone size screen.
[1965.52 → 1965.88] Oh my.
[1966.00 → 1966.24] Okay.
[1966.32 → 1967.30] Wide screen.
[1967.48 → 1968.04] Oh jeez.
[1968.46 → 1969.48] Square screen.
[1969.68 → 1970.96] They can do square.

[2002.90 → 2004.16] We're going to have that linked down below.
[2004.26 → 2006.70] And use offer code when to save 10%.
[2006.70 → 2007.26] When?
[2007.58 → 2008.14] Right now.
[2008.36 → 2010.22] One quick thing before you go on to the next one.
[2010.42 → 2010.70] Yes.
[2011.00 → 2011.42] Float plane.
[2011.42 → 2013.08] There's a poll for just you.
[2013.32 → 2014.22] Brought to you by Float plane.
[2014.96 → 2016.16] There's a poll for just what, sorry?
[2016.44 → 2024.30] Someone in the Float plane chat came with the idea that the Float plane viewers, probably an increased amount of VPN users,
[2024.64 → 2026.30] probably a little bit more hardcore and stuff.
[2026.72 → 2029.26] Maybe we should see what just their poll would be.
[2029.26 → 2030.58] Should we just let Float plane decide?
[2031.08 → 2031.36] Okay.
[2031.46 → 2031.94] You know what?
[2032.20 → 2032.70] Screw it.
[2032.88 → 2034.46] I'm just going to let Float plane decide.
[2034.56 → 2034.68] Okay.
[2034.70 → 2035.70] Do you have it up on your screen?
[2035.86 → 2036.46] I do.
[2036.46 → 2038.96] I want it revealed to me at the same time as you.
[2039.16 → 2039.64] Let's do it.
[2039.64 → 2043.34] They're still voting, but this one's a lot more clear.
[2043.88 → 2044.32] Okay.
[2045.38 → 2045.98] Hey, 69.
[2046.18 → 2046.46] Nice.
[2048.62 → 2050.30] This one is significantly more clear.
[2050.98 → 2055.46] There's still votes coming in, as you see, but the percentages are roughly staying the same.
[2055.48 → 2063.52] What's also nice about the Float plane one is its far less likely to have people with ready-to-go accounts to spam anything.
[2063.52 → 2064.46] Oh, like YouTube account things?
[2064.46 → 2068.06] Yeah, these are paid accounts, so we know that these are actually legitimately real people.
[2068.20 → 2070.90] People are unlikely to have a duplicate account for Float plane.
[2070.98 → 2072.62] I mean, you can if you want.
[2072.72 → 2078.18] Thank you very much, but I think that's not really a normal use case.
[2078.44 → 2081.62] Actually, another Float plane-related matter.
[2081.78 → 2086.04] I did not realize that we were uploading our videos in 1080p quality.
[2086.28 → 2086.44] Yeah.
[2087.44 → 2088.14] So, yeah.
[2088.46 → 2089.62] We're going to switch to 4K.
[2089.62 → 2092.94] I actually enabled the 4K tier on Float plane.
[2093.62 → 2100.18] Assuming that everything we uploaded was, like, at 4K source quality, I didn't realize that we weren't.
[2100.18 → 2101.66] So, we're working on that.
[2101.74 → 2103.40] We're getting that sorted out.
[2103.56 → 2103.94] Okay, cool.
[2103.94 → 2111.68] And I have another only sort of Float plane-related piece of news.
[2112.30 → 2113.34] Channel Super Fun.
[2114.24 → 2114.82] The one.
[2115.46 → 2116.30] The only.
[2116.52 → 2118.26] Okay, so quick, quick, just before we go on.
[2118.80 → 2122.64] Someone in the Float plane audience is a butt and leaked this.
[2122.78 → 2123.92] Oh, no, I leaked this.
[2124.04 → 2124.64] You showed my screen.
[2124.72 → 2125.28] It showed the URL.
[2125.42 → 2126.10] Oh, well, that's okay.
[2126.20 → 2126.54] They had already answered.
[2126.54 → 2127.02] Either way.
[2127.02 → 2127.98] Okay, you know what?
[2128.06 → 2128.48] That's it.
[2128.80 → 2129.96] The Float plane audience is perfect.
[2130.16 → 2130.52] That's it.
[2130.52 → 2130.98] That was us.
[2131.08 → 2132.76] The answer is done.
[2132.92 → 2134.58] Float plane said, YouTube says, maybe.
[2134.70 → 2135.76] Float plane says yes.
[2136.36 → 2138.80] So, Float plane people, because we know you're real people.
[2140.28 → 2141.30] I am done.
[2141.44 → 2141.82] Conclusive.
[2142.02 → 2143.84] 60% of the time, it works every time.
[2144.00 → 2145.38] We're going with the Float plane conclusion.
[2146.04 → 2147.26] Okay, big news.
[2147.94 → 2149.66] This is, like, the biggest news ever.
[2150.16 → 2151.10] Channel Super Fun.
[2151.72 → 2151.92] Okay.
[2152.76 → 2153.54] Display capture.
[2153.54 → 2154.16] Oh, oh.
[2155.02 → 2155.30] Mm.
[2155.30 → 2157.34] Sure.
[2159.78 → 2160.22] Okay.
[2160.48 → 2161.18] Everything here good?
[2161.88 → 2163.04] What are you trying to?
[2163.16 → 2164.56] I want to show Float plane.
[2165.06 → 2165.42] Okay.
[2165.82 → 2166.16] Okay.
[2166.80 → 2167.66] So, okay.
[2168.38 → 2168.84] Oh, boy.
[2169.08 → 2169.80] I'm sorry, Float plane.
[2169.80 → 2170.74] Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.
[2170.84 → 2171.52] That's very awful.
[2171.76 → 2172.54] What are we doing?
[2172.54 → 2172.94] All right.
[2173.14 → 2175.66] We are looking at Linus Tech Tips on Float plane.
[2178.40 → 2182.60] And we are looking at the return of the one, the only,
[2183.20 → 2184.78] Channel Super Fun!
[2186.02 → 2186.68] Please play.
[2188.66 → 2189.80] Way to go, Luke.
[2190.00 → 2190.40] Awkward.
[2190.64 → 2191.16] There it is.
[2191.38 → 2191.88] Hooray.
[2192.60 → 2193.56] There it is.
[2193.66 → 2195.06] Look at this guy.
[2195.32 → 2196.02] Look at this guy.
[2196.20 → 2197.82] Look at his hairline's receding.
[2198.18 → 2198.70] What a loser.
[2200.46 → 2204.62] Basically, we did, like, a paper airplane challenge of some sort.
[2204.62 → 2204.72] Whoa!
[2204.72 → 2206.40] Don't worry about it.
[2207.40 → 2208.54] Don't worry about it.
[2208.88 → 2209.94] You know, there are no worries.
[2210.10 → 2212.46] There's just, you know, go check it out.
[2212.62 → 2213.48] It's good stuff.
[2213.68 → 2214.06] Hold on.
[2214.12 → 2214.96] Let me just fix this.
[2215.04 → 2216.78] This is, oh, this is so broken.
[2216.98 → 2217.82] One moment, please.
[2218.04 → 2219.04] Yes, I wish to remove it.
[2219.04 → 2219.70] Yeah, and we're back.
[2219.70 → 2221.92] Watch the video.
[2222.04 → 2222.32] Okay.
[2222.42 → 2223.06] It's going to be great.
[2223.14 → 2224.62] Channel Super Fun's back, dog.
[2225.82 → 2230.04] Colton, me, and Jon were heavily involved.
[2230.28 → 2231.10] It's going to be a blast.
[2231.16 → 2231.90] You guys are going to love it.
[2232.22 → 2234.16] The whole Float plane chat is just roasting me right now.
[2234.50 → 2234.80] Oh, why?
[2234.80 → 2236.84] We tried to roast them, but it was actually our fault.
[2237.02 → 2237.56] Oh, yeah.
[2237.74 → 2238.22] Well, no.
[2238.32 → 2238.72] Oof.
[2239.66 → 2240.26] That's fair.
[2240.36 → 2240.78] That's fair.
[2240.92 → 2241.18] You know what?
[2241.18 → 2241.38] That's fair.
[2241.40 → 2242.26] You win this round.
[2244.24 → 2246.22] Also, last sponsor for the show.
[2246.92 → 2247.12] OOP.
[2247.50 → 2247.82] Displate.
[2248.68 → 2251.88] A Displate is a magnet-mounted metal print with art.
[2252.42 → 2255.30] It's durable, and you don't need any power tools to hang it.
[2255.30 → 2259.00] They've got over a quarter million different art spanning a bunch of different styles and influences.
[2259.64 → 2263.78] Easy magnetic mounting, so there are no holes in the wall, and it's easily replaceable.
[2263.78 → 2271.34] They plant a tree for every Displate purchased, and we can show our portraits page.
[2271.62 → 2272.96] Let me just bring that up.
[2273.74 → 2274.00] Whoops.
[2274.14 → 2275.32] Well, that's not the right page.
[2275.42 → 2276.48] There it is.
[2278.76 → 2280.36] And it's loaded.
[2281.02 → 2283.14] Five displaces by Linus Sebastian.
[2283.34 → 2286.24] I actually did not create those, but people on our team did.
[2286.72 → 2287.10] Look at this.
[2287.12 → 2288.14] Look at this Riley guy.
[2289.22 → 2290.52] Hey, they got his shirt wrong.
[2290.68 → 2291.88] He works for Tech Linked.
[2292.58 → 2293.48] Actually, he does.
[2293.48 → 2295.04] He does LTT stuff all the time.
[2295.60 → 2296.64] So, Displate, guys.
[2296.92 → 2298.00] Go check him out.
[2298.94 → 2303.64] You can get 15% off using code LTT at the link below.
[2303.76 → 2306.52] So, that's leg.GG slash Displate when.
[2307.84 → 2308.40] Light.
[2308.80 → 2311.74] What else we got for big, important topics today?
[2312.84 → 2313.58] Ah, Tesla.
[2313.76 → 2315.44] Removing software features from used cars.
[2315.54 → 2316.72] I was actually reading about this.
[2316.94 → 2317.52] It's interesting.
[2317.52 → 2319.40] So, there's a Model S sold at auction.
[2319.88 → 2324.88] The guy bought it with the understanding that it had the full autopilot feature.
[2325.10 → 2326.80] And then I think there was one other one.
[2327.88 → 2328.02] Yeah.
[2328.10 → 2329.68] Autopilot was advertised as a feature.
[2329.68 → 2334.08] And, oh, the story here says the previous owner paid $8,000 for it.
[2334.16 → 2344.90] But the article that I read about it was Tesla was saying that actually we were doing an audit and this car was not entitled to autopilot.
[2344.90 → 2352.52] In the description of work, it says autopilot was removed on November 18th, 2019 after it was found that the customer did not purchase the software.
[2352.64 → 2364.66] So, basically, the car updated to the latest version and autopilot was removed after this customer bought a car that supposedly had autopilot.
[2365.06 → 2365.20] Yeah.
[2366.30 → 2370.18] So, oh, man.
[2370.76 → 2371.80] This is brutal.
[2371.80 → 2378.86] I'm trying to see if there's, like, an official statement or an update or anything like that to see if there's something along what you said.
[2378.92 → 2379.52] But I don't see anything.
[2379.52 → 2380.92] So, there are a couple ways to look at this.
[2381.00 → 2386.20] One is, like, obviously, you don't get the Steam library that was logged in when you buy a laptop.
[2386.90 → 2387.30] Obviously.
[2387.96 → 2388.58] Well, hold on.
[2388.74 → 2388.96] No, no.
[2389.02 → 2389.88] Think for a second, though.
[2390.06 → 2391.58] What if someone sold their Tesla?
[2391.96 → 2392.22] Okay.
[2392.28 → 2392.52] No, no.
[2392.58 → 2393.00] Hold on.
[2393.16 → 2393.40] No, no.
[2393.42 → 2394.54] I'm going somewhere with this.
[2394.54 → 2394.66] Okay.
[2394.76 → 2395.04] Stop.
[2396.08 → 2396.48] Stop.
[2396.60 → 2397.00] Okay.
[2398.36 → 2398.72] Okay.
[2398.72 → 2402.48] So, I am a Model S owner.
[2402.78 → 2403.04] Okay.
[2403.16 → 2403.56] Hypothetically.
[2403.66 → 2403.86] Sure.
[2403.94 → 2404.84] I'm a Model S owner.
[2405.02 → 2405.22] Yeah.
[2405.50 → 2407.46] And I'm going to sell my Model S.
[2407.50 → 2408.40] And I'm like, you know what?
[2408.52 → 2410.10] Model S, that's for chumps.
[2410.48 → 2411.90] I'm getting the Model X.
[2412.98 → 2413.80] X-rated.
[2414.54 → 2415.58] Big, you know?
[2415.78 → 2416.70] Big X.
[2416.94 → 2417.40] Big X.
[2417.44 → 2417.92] Indifferent.
[2418.72 → 2419.28] Yeah, sure.
[2419.28 → 2428.22] So, from my perspective, as a Tesla customer who bought some $8,000 software upgrade for
[2428.22 → 2431.78] my car, maybe I want to take that with me.
[2432.42 → 2432.86] Okay.
[2433.04 → 2433.34] Okay.
[2433.60 → 2434.64] But hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2434.64 → 2435.44] I'm going somewhere with this.
[2435.50 → 2436.28] I'm going somewhere with this.
[2436.36 → 2437.26] Can you calm down?
[2437.78 → 2438.22] No.
[2438.92 → 2439.32] No.
[2440.24 → 2441.08] I can tell.
[2441.20 → 2443.46] He looks externally like he's calm.
[2443.46 → 2447.02] See, that's why I keep telling him to relax, because I can tell.
[2447.64 → 2453.40] Right below the surface, right a millimetre below the surface, he's going to explode.
[2453.54 → 2454.08] He's dynamite.
[2454.18 → 2455.24] He's a dynamite kind of guy.
[2455.38 → 2455.52] Yeah.
[2455.62 → 2455.92] All right.
[2456.04 → 2458.50] So, I want to take my autopilot with me.
[2458.66 → 2458.90] Okay.
[2458.94 → 2462.86] Why should I have to pay for a software feature that I already paid for?
[2463.14 → 2469.38] So, in that case, if I were to say, hey, I think that Tesla should license their advanced
[2469.38 → 2475.18] driving features to the user rather than the car, I would have at least some ground to
[2475.18 → 2475.52] stand on.
[2475.56 → 2479.20] Now, I've been playing devil's advocate this entire time, because I think this is ridiculous.
[2479.70 → 2481.38] But why don't you go ahead and...
[2482.12 → 2486.08] If it was licensed to the user, and it was made very clear that that was the arrangement
[2486.08 → 2492.10] that they had, which is not how it works at all, I think that would be its own conversation.
[2492.78 → 2493.00] Yeah.
[2493.30 → 2494.38] It's tied to the car.
[2494.94 → 2497.88] So, the Steam library argument doesn't really, like...
[2497.88 → 2498.68] No, no, it doesn't.
[2498.68 → 2499.18] It doesn't make any sense.
[2499.18 → 2501.30] It was just for us to be able to have a conversation.
[2501.56 → 2501.60] Sure.
[2501.60 → 2508.42] About, like, hey, in an alternate reality, this could be weird, but interesting, just because,
[2508.50 → 2511.46] like, it could be tied to the user, not the car, and they could go to a car that doesn't
[2511.46 → 2513.04] support it, and then it's like, uh...
[2513.04 → 2513.62] Yes.
[2513.78 → 2518.62] So, that is really the problem with the entire argument I was making.
[2518.62 → 2521.92] And then you, like, go into your buddy's car and log in, and it's like, hey!
[2522.10 → 2523.96] Hey, I got autopilot now, boys.
[2524.96 → 2525.32] Yeah.
[2526.96 → 2528.50] Hey, lets all share the same account.
[2528.50 → 2528.92] I don't know.
[2528.92 → 2528.94] I don't know.
[2528.94 → 2529.00] Yeah.
[2529.00 → 2529.44] Now, that...
[2529.44 → 2530.38] Hold on a second.
[2531.10 → 2531.46] Whoa.
[2532.96 → 2533.36] Whoa.
[2533.98 → 2534.28] Whoa.
[2534.38 → 2534.40] Whoa.
[2534.40 → 2537.28] So, you want to drive your friend around because you get better features in your car?
[2537.28 → 2537.50] Hold on.
[2537.50 → 2537.94] Hold on a minute.
[2538.76 → 2540.38] No, because it's an autopilot feature.
[2540.46 → 2540.98] I ain't driving.
[2541.10 → 2541.64] Nobody's driving.
[2542.16 → 2542.52] Okay.
[2542.70 → 2543.00] Okay.
[2543.00 → 2549.42] So, I think people who are being realistic, and I'm sorry to everyone who this is very
[2549.42 → 2550.60] bad news for you.
[2551.40 → 2552.98] I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
[2553.46 → 2558.60] For people who are being realistic, I think the future of people not owning cars is pretty
[2558.60 → 2559.80] clear at this point.
[2560.10 → 2560.24] Yeah.
[2560.94 → 2563.12] Cars as a service is happening.
[2563.24 → 2564.14] I'm so sorry.
[2564.50 → 2565.48] I'm so sorry.
[2566.02 → 2567.26] They're grieving right now.
[2567.26 → 2568.82] It'll be there when you wake up.
[2569.22 → 2571.36] It'll just have been somewhere else while you're asleep.
[2571.50 → 2571.86] That's right.
[2572.08 → 2573.20] So, cars as a service.
[2573.48 → 2574.26] That's coming.
[2575.08 → 2575.56] Whoa.
[2576.48 → 2582.10] So, I'm just using some fleet of autonomous cars or whatever.
[2582.88 → 2583.24] Oh.
[2583.42 → 2587.44] I, as a user, license better features.
[2587.80 → 2589.80] Now, I'm not saying I like this as a user.
[2590.04 → 2590.36] Whoa.
[2590.76 → 2591.60] I'm just saying...
[2591.60 → 2592.92] That's brilliant and horrible.
[2592.92 → 2596.06] From the fleet management perspective...
[2596.06 → 2597.20] You can have all the same car.
[2597.26 → 2600.72] If they just have basic cars, and then...
[2600.72 → 2601.42] So, hold on.
[2601.52 → 2601.72] Okay.
[2601.82 → 2602.44] Oh, my goodness.
[2602.56 → 2603.90] This is, like, next-level stuff.
[2604.16 → 2609.58] Obviously, Mr. Musk figured this out 10 years ago, and that's, like, why he's pushing so
[2609.58 → 2610.82] hard for all this crap.
[2611.02 → 2612.42] But, okay.
[2612.72 → 2615.10] So, here's the dynamic, okay?
[2615.34 → 2619.42] You've got the car as a service provider, and I know Tesla wants to be one of them.
[2619.42 → 2623.06] They want to be vertically integrated, but let's say they don't reach complete saturation.
[2623.30 → 2624.94] So, you've got the car as a service provider.
[2625.24 → 2626.08] You've got Tesla.
[2626.48 → 2627.88] You've got the end user.
[2628.34 → 2634.88] So, now you've got all these different licensing options to work together on as Tesla and the
[2634.88 → 2635.96] car as a service company, right?
[2636.28 → 2641.24] So, either Tesla can go, hey, you know, we're going to offer users directly the option to
[2641.24 → 2644.64] license air conditioning, for example, okay?
[2644.64 → 2646.48] We're going to license air conditioning.
[2646.64 → 2654.40] We're going to license, you know, the ability to go more than 100 miles at a time, or whatever
[2654.40 → 2655.38] the case may be.
[2655.54 → 2655.72] Yeah.
[2655.80 → 2659.14] And then the cars as a service company is going to go, well, no, hold on a second.
[2659.48 → 2660.18] How about this?
[2660.40 → 2668.44] How about we bulk license some percentage of our fleet based on, in much the same way
[2668.44 → 2674.78] that you would, shoot, I'm missing the word, provision, in much the same way that you would
[2674.78 → 2675.96] provision a server.
[2676.38 → 2681.04] So, where you would oversell the hardware that's actually on the machine based on that, not
[2681.04 → 2682.28] all of it will be used at a time.
[2682.46 → 2688.06] So, the car as a service company is like, okay, 30% of our fleet is going to have, you
[2688.06 → 2694.38] know, music, better music quality, you know, some better codec or whatever, so it sounds
[2694.38 → 2694.74] better.
[2694.78 → 2695.00] Sure.
[2695.00 → 2695.46] Right?
[2695.58 → 2699.32] I'm just trying to come up with features that you could give and take away.
[2699.32 → 2701.00] The feature right now is not that important.
[2701.02 → 2702.10] The idea is important.
[2702.12 → 2703.02] Yeah, it's just the idea.
[2703.28 → 2707.86] So, we're going to license that from you, and then we're going to charge a higher tier
[2707.86 → 2712.56] to the people who want access to those features under the assumption that we will never have
[2712.56 → 2716.78] more than 30% of our fleet deployed with these higher tier users.
[2717.28 → 2721.66] And so, there's all these different ways that they could work together to make sure that
[2721.66 → 2723.04] people don't own anything.
[2725.00 → 2726.28] Yeah.
[2727.22 → 2728.76] That, pretty much.
[2729.32 → 2730.12] That sucks.
[2731.20 → 2731.98] It's brilliant.
[2732.32 → 2732.60] Yeah.
[2733.00 → 2736.56] They're going to make so much money, like, so much more money than selling people cars.
[2736.68 → 2741.56] Like, selling people cars at this point is, like, the worst business to get into.
[2741.56 → 2743.44] I mean, that's why nobody is doing it.
[2743.64 → 2746.06] Like, you might say, oh, Tesla.
[2746.20 → 2746.56] No, no, no.
[2746.60 → 2748.66] Tesla's not getting into the business of selling people cars.
[2749.02 → 2753.12] They're getting into the business of being an energy solutions provider, part of which
[2753.12 → 2754.62] is automobiles.
[2754.62 → 2760.32] And they're getting into the business of autonomous vehicle fleet sales and management.
[2761.58 → 2765.74] Because the problem with selling people cars is that you only get paid once.
[2765.88 → 2769.48] And that is not the way of the future, for better or for worse.
[2769.48 → 2772.44] And not only that, but it comes with so much overhead.
[2772.80 → 2777.86] And, like, we know from a conversation we had, I'm assuming one or two months ago at
[2777.86 → 2781.18] this point, that, like, taxi company that had Teslas.
[2781.26 → 2781.70] Do you remember that?
[2782.28 → 2784.66] Like, 300,000 miles, no major repairs.
[2786.54 → 2786.94] Yeah.
[2786.94 → 2794.32] So if you have that, if you have fleet mechanics, and you have, like, repair infrastructure, which
[2794.32 → 2797.92] I'm sure they have, where they can swap engines, they can swap batteries, they can do whatever
[2797.92 → 2802.10] they need to keep these things going way more cheaply than an end user would be able to.
[2802.42 → 2802.72] Yep.
[2802.78 → 2806.42] And then you're licensing them out, and you get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[2806.42 → 2808.14] of kilometres on these things.
[2808.72 → 2815.30] Instead of, like, I don't know what the average amount of kilometres someone starts to replace
[2815.30 → 2818.88] a car is, but instead of that, you get way freaking more.
[2819.70 → 2820.06] Yeah.
[2820.74 → 2822.14] People are so in denial.
[2822.42 → 2824.06] In America, we own things.
[2824.74 → 2825.06] Do you?
[2825.22 → 2825.56] Do you?
[2825.94 → 2826.42] Do you?
[2826.52 → 2827.58] Do you buy movies still?
[2827.92 → 2830.28] Do you buy movies still?
[2831.22 → 2833.08] Do you have physical copies of games still?
[2833.16 → 2833.50] Do you have CDs?
[2834.00 → 2835.40] Do you own any CDs?
[2836.82 → 2839.62] Oh, boy.
[2839.92 → 2840.18] Yeah.
[2840.36 → 2841.38] So I'm sorry.
[2841.48 → 2844.48] I'm sorry that that was hard to hear, but, man, it is going to...
[2844.48 → 2845.48] Like, I wonder.
[2845.68 → 2846.72] I honestly wonder.
[2846.94 → 2854.46] My kids are still not even close to the age where they would legally be allowed to drive.
[2854.70 → 2854.94] Yeah.
[2855.24 → 2862.08] And in much the same way that I sort of would marvel at how my parents just knew their way
[2862.08 → 2863.78] around, like, driving.
[2864.12 → 2866.84] I was like, why don't you just use Google Maps?
[2867.30 → 2867.52] You know?
[2867.60 → 2868.44] Like, right?
[2868.44 → 2869.44] Right?
[2869.44 → 2872.68] I wonder if there's going to be another generational gap that soon.
[2872.90 → 2874.46] Why are you still driving the car?
[2874.46 → 2875.96] Why are you operating a steering wheel?
[2876.02 → 2877.04] Who even needs to do that?
[2877.12 → 2877.22] What?
[2877.28 → 2877.90] That's stupid.
[2878.06 → 2879.84] Like, it's a waste of my brain cells to even...
[2879.84 → 2881.68] I wouldn't just, like...
[2881.68 → 2882.62] I was just going to say, read.
[2883.32 → 2883.66] Yeah.
[2885.02 → 2885.62] Watch...
[2885.62 → 2886.16] Something.
[2886.28 → 2886.64] ...a video.
[2886.82 → 2887.08] Yeah.
[2887.08 → 2892.94] Oh, hey, Nick.
[2892.96 → 2895.02] I got a question for you, and then you can jump in.
[2895.16 → 2898.26] Also, I'm sure there's a ton of people being like, I own records!
[2898.72 → 2900.90] And, yeah, there will be people like that with cars.
[2901.08 → 2901.76] Yeah, absolutely.
[2901.88 → 2907.28] And they can take their cars to the track once manually operated vehicles are no longer legal
[2907.28 → 2907.82] on roads.
[2908.42 → 2909.72] Don't kid yourself.
[2910.06 → 2911.02] That will happen.
[2912.02 → 2913.16] Might be a long time.
[2913.18 → 2916.06] I think Linus thinks this is going to happen in, like, 15 years, and it's actually going
[2916.06 → 2916.90] to happen in, like, 50.
[2917.04 → 2917.86] Yeah, 50 is fine.
[2917.98 → 2919.64] No, I'm not saying 15 years.
[2919.74 → 2924.04] I'm saying that it will be an option in 15 years, and then it will become mainstream.
[2924.24 → 2930.26] Because the thing is, the only way for big changes like these to happen are through people
[2930.26 → 2931.68] dying and being born.
[2932.40 → 2937.12] People who remember the old way die, and people who never knew any other way are born into
[2937.12 → 2937.14] it.
[2937.14 → 2937.98] And industry's going to have to swap over.
[2937.98 → 2942.28] And, like, the like, shipping industry and stuff, in terms of, like, trucks and everything,
[2942.38 → 2943.46] is going to completely swap.
[2943.56 → 2944.70] Because they'll see reliable.
[2945.12 → 2949.24] So, like, industries will change and re-standardize to this entirely.
[2949.36 → 2950.78] Everything trickles down from the enterprise.
[2951.18 → 2951.32] Yeah.
[2951.64 → 2952.50] Not enterprise.
[2952.62 → 2953.52] The car rental company.
[2953.78 → 2954.36] The enterprise.
[2954.48 → 2955.00] Enterprise.
[2955.14 → 2956.96] Everything in the world trickles down from the enterprise car rental.
[2956.96 → 2958.16] I heard they pick you up.
[2958.22 → 2959.02] I heard they pick you up.
[2959.02 → 2959.20] Yeah.
[2959.86 → 2961.66] Putty's the best spokesman ever.
[2961.66 → 2969.52] Jacob Salman says, would a limited run LTX disc plate at LTX be something we could see
[2969.52 → 2969.98] in the future?
[2970.78 → 2971.22] Yeah.
[2971.28 → 2974.00] We're already, we have a design for LTX posters already.
[2974.28 → 2974.60] Okay.
[2974.88 → 2975.18] So.
[2975.34 → 2975.72] Well, yeah.
[2975.80 → 2977.34] I think people would like to buy them there.
[2977.78 → 2978.24] There you go.
[2978.30 → 2980.64] I mean, well, disc plates, I don't know.
[2981.16 → 2981.18] But.
[2981.38 → 2981.80] Oh, okay.
[2981.80 → 2982.38] But something.
[2982.72 → 2983.02] Something.
[2983.16 → 2983.42] All right.
[2983.52 → 2984.54] What can I do for you, sir?
[2984.54 → 2986.16] We should talk about LTT Store.
[2986.16 → 2987.54] LTT Store dot com.
[2987.54 → 2988.58] LTT Store dot com.
[2988.58 → 2991.20] We heard the good news about LTT Store dot com.
[2991.26 → 2993.48] I actually did talk about LTT Store dot com.
[2993.56 → 2994.46] Oh, this is great.
[2994.70 → 2996.46] I think it was like one of the first things we said.
[2996.52 → 2998.54] Did you mean LTT Store dot com?
[2998.66 → 2999.16] I did.
[2999.66 → 3000.36] I love training.
[3001.82 → 3002.16] Dang it.
[3002.24 → 3002.96] Not that one.
[3003.94 → 3004.44] What's that?
[3004.64 → 3005.36] Beat Safer person?
[3005.54 → 3006.22] Otter something?
[3006.46 → 3008.22] Uh, uh, uh, Otter Worldly.
[3008.48 → 3009.24] Otter Worldly.
[3009.32 → 3015.34] Like the top comment on their video is after all that workout, you should get a water bottle
[3015.34 → 3015.44] from LTT Store dot com.
[3015.44 → 3016.18] I did see that.
[3016.40 → 3017.92] And it has 2,000 upvotes.
[3017.92 → 3018.80] 2,000 upvotes.
[3018.82 → 3019.36] What are you doing?
[3020.10 → 3020.46] Yeah.
[3020.74 → 3022.10] What are you doing upvoting things?
[3022.14 → 3023.36] You should just be buying water bottles.
[3023.36 → 3025.32] You guys should send them a water bottle.
[3025.34 → 3025.60] So sorry.
[3025.66 → 3026.30] What's the good news?
[3026.88 → 3027.22] I don't know.
[3027.42 → 3028.14] It's a store.
[3028.28 → 3028.86] You buy stuff.
[3028.92 → 3029.08] Oh.
[3030.58 → 3031.80] Get out of here.
[3032.06 → 3032.88] It's a store.
[3033.04 → 3033.76] Get out of here.
[3034.00 → 3034.72] I know what it is.
[3034.72 → 3035.00] My box is gone.
[3035.02 → 3038.02] This is how we're going to pay for our cars as a service subscription.
[3038.24 → 3039.16] Oh, Lord.
[3039.16 → 3040.08] We're at home.
[3040.78 → 3042.48] We need a water bottle subscription.
[3042.48 → 3043.12] Oh, my God.
[3043.18 → 3046.94] You could have that be a company benefit.
[3047.94 → 3053.86] Is your service for your morning work pickup and your afternoon work drop off could be covered
[3053.86 → 3054.50] by your company?
[3054.76 → 3054.98] Yep.
[3055.30 → 3058.26] And that would be a way for the company to be like, you're going to be here on time.
[3058.32 → 3062.56] And the executive package could include like, it takes your kids to school too or whatever.
[3062.56 → 3064.62] Say, I'm carving out that.
[3064.80 → 3065.66] I'm carving out that.
[3065.68 → 3068.96] They could have discounts for like company fleets.
[3070.36 → 3070.80] Man.
[3071.20 → 3071.60] Absolutely.
[3072.14 → 3076.22] It could automatically adjust based on schedules, input by the company.
[3076.22 → 3079.96] Well, just like Uber, you'd have surge pricing during the times when everyone's commuting
[3079.96 → 3080.78] and it would be cheaper.
[3081.00 → 3084.72] So you're going to have companies like offset their hours by five minutes and stuff like
[3084.72 → 3084.90] that.
[3084.94 → 3086.52] That would also help overall traffic.
[3086.68 → 3086.92] Yep.
[3087.06 → 3087.50] Absolutely.
[3087.50 → 3093.08] But yeah, like if you were on like a somewhat variable schedule, it could just automatically
[3093.08 → 3094.80] change it so you know what's going on.
[3094.96 → 3097.06] Your car could inform you when you need to go to work.
[3097.10 → 3098.18] Do you speak from experience?
[3098.60 → 3099.32] Variable schedule?
[3100.50 → 3101.74] It's like hardly ever here.
[3102.68 → 3103.44] All I'm saying is...
[3103.44 → 3105.20] I do not have appropriate facilities.
[3105.76 → 3110.26] All I'm saying is if you voted no on the poll to continue working with PIA, you better
[3110.26 → 3112.76] go over to LTTstore.com and support us directly.
[3113.84 → 3115.38] Put your money where your mouth is.
[3115.42 → 3115.70] Okay.
[3115.76 → 3116.04] All right.
[3116.08 → 3116.34] All right.
[3116.36 → 3116.70] All right.
[3116.74 → 3117.04] All right.
[3117.04 → 3118.60] I'm hard trolling.
[3118.68 → 3118.96] Okay.
[3119.28 → 3120.52] Wired.com.
[3120.74 → 3123.12] This is great, I guess.
[3123.24 → 3127.46] Well, after the announcement from Adobe that they were killing off Flash, Ben Baltimore
[3127.46 → 3134.30] at Blue Maxima on Twitter has saved over 38,000 Flash games in a behemoth torrent as part
[3134.30 → 3136.96] of Flashpoint, a web game preservation product.
[3137.10 → 3139.36] So sites like Newgrounds, AddictingGames.com.
[3139.44 → 3140.94] That was my weapon of choice.
[3140.96 → 3141.46] AddictingGames.com?
[3141.58 → 3141.78] Yeah.
[3141.98 → 3142.36] Me too.
[3142.46 → 3142.98] 100%.
[3142.98 → 3143.00] Miniclip.
[3143.32 → 3146.72] Millions of people went to play and publish games that influenced generations.
[3146.72 → 3148.62] I think that's probably overstating it a little bit.
[3148.76 → 3149.14] Generation.
[3149.14 → 3149.34] Generation.
[3149.64 → 3155.04] He started in 2017 with a group of programmers and curators when he realized there was no
[3155.04 → 3159.36] historical archive for these games, animations, and experiments.
[3159.36 → 3165.42] So the Flashpoint project is currently 241 gigabytes and includes all the media files and a launcher.
[3165.86 → 3169.06] There's also a launcher-only download that allows you to install individual games.
[3169.46 → 3173.36] So the video game designers behind celebrated titles like Crypt of the Necromancer, Hollow
[3173.36 → 3177.74] Knight, and Super Meat Boy all got their start noodling around with Flash.
[3177.74 → 3183.22] This highlights the importance of digital archiving because we could lose a lot of the cultural
[3183.22 → 3183.96] history of the internet.
[3184.08 → 3190.12] In fact, one of the games on AddictingGames.com that was like my go-to was a little simple
[3190.12 → 3191.56] Flash game called Pearl Harbour.
[3192.10 → 3196.50] So you were a plane and you...
[3196.50 → 3200.54] I forget what the flight mechanics were, but you had to dip for some reason.
[3200.66 → 3203.44] You had to dip and then come up for some reason.
[3203.44 → 3208.48] And there were ships down below, and you had like a limited number of bombs, and you were...
[3208.48 → 3209.44] You just advanced through levels.
[3209.54 → 3210.80] Very simple game, but it was fun.
[3212.08 → 3214.00] Just one day was off the site.
[3214.64 → 3219.94] If I had to guess, I would say someone got uncomfortable with Japanese planes bombing American
[3219.94 → 3220.90] ships or something.
[3221.30 → 3222.60] That's just my guess.
[3222.76 → 3223.22] I don't know.
[3223.34 → 3224.88] Maybe someone out there is watching.
[3225.00 → 3230.08] Maybe this will be like that Supreme Commander Risk Map where like the entire community was
[3230.08 → 3233.08] like, hey, yo, you should update it.
[3233.08 → 3233.80] And you did.
[3233.88 → 3234.46] And then we played it.
[3234.50 → 3235.24] We should play it again sometime.
[3235.24 → 3235.50] It was fun.
[3235.64 → 3235.72] Yeah.
[3235.82 → 3236.06] I'm down.
[3236.74 → 3238.26] Anyway, so it just disappeared.
[3238.34 → 3242.08] And I was like, oh, well, I can never play that game again.
[3242.28 → 3242.84] Well, that blows.
[3243.88 → 3244.86] Speaking of not owning things.
[3245.08 → 3245.24] Yeah.
[3245.28 → 3246.62] Speaking of not owning things.
[3248.14 → 3251.90] The first picture they have on the article on PC Gamer is...
[3251.90 → 3254.70] I don't actually see it say this in here, but I'm certain it's Stick RPG.
[3255.16 → 3256.62] This game was so cool.
[3257.06 → 3257.70] Like I just...
[3257.70 → 3258.66] Oh, I remember Stick RPG.
[3258.74 → 3259.62] Yeah, I played Stick RPG.
[3259.84 → 3260.86] Stick RPG was amazing.
[3261.08 → 3262.04] Stick RPG was sweet.
[3262.04 → 3265.76] Like I think everyone played Stick RPG.
[3265.92 → 3267.64] I remember there being a ton of content.
[3267.94 → 3269.60] I remember it getting kind of boring pretty fast.
[3269.62 → 3270.10] It was.
[3270.36 → 3270.60] Yeah.
[3270.82 → 3273.30] But like it was really cool at the time.
[3273.46 → 3273.66] Yeah.
[3274.10 → 3277.38] And for the time, I mean, it had a decent amount of content for a web game.
[3278.02 → 3279.14] For a browser game.
[3279.78 → 3280.54] It was pretty limited.
[3280.74 → 3282.26] I don't even remember anything you could do.
[3282.34 → 3283.02] It was like kind of dumb.
[3283.02 → 3284.78] You could go to the bar and you could fight.
[3284.94 → 3285.10] Yeah.
[3285.10 → 3287.82] Or I think throw gamble somehow.
[3288.16 → 3289.14] You could go work out.
[3289.70 → 3291.92] There was a job that you could go to.
[3292.06 → 3293.28] I do remember you could get a job.
[3293.28 → 3298.90] And you could like talk to that like dude outside the convenience store.
[3298.90 → 3300.26] Can you remember this really well?
[3300.28 → 3302.16] And get like a skateboard and a car.
[3302.16 → 3303.90] How much Stick RPG did you play?
[3304.64 → 3305.40] Probably a lot.
[3305.54 → 3306.38] I don't really remember.
[3306.62 → 3307.40] It's been a long time.
[3307.64 → 3308.06] I just...
[3308.06 → 3311.68] Well, looking at this picture, like I got hit in the face with like, oh yeah.
[3312.32 → 3313.38] All this stuff.
[3313.38 → 3315.56] I probably put like half an hour into it.
[3315.92 → 3317.72] It sounds like you were hardcore.
[3318.04 → 3318.08] Yeah.
[3318.14 → 3319.64] I think I like beat it or something.
[3319.98 → 3321.96] I don't know if there is really an ending, but I don't know.
[3322.68 → 3324.02] I took it very far.
[3324.16 → 3324.60] I remember that.
[3327.58 → 3328.84] Last topic for today.
[3329.24 → 3332.90] Xbox says Nintendo and Sony are no longer their main rivals.
[3335.34 → 3335.70] Okay.
[3335.70 → 3337.96] I got to jump into one thing that says in here.
[3337.96 → 3345.10] Phil Spencer said that's not to disrespect Nintendo and Sony,
[3345.28 → 3349.18] but their traditional gaming companies are somewhat out of position.
[3353.20 → 3357.28] So Mr. Spencer knows that content is king, right?
[3357.96 → 3359.18] Is he aware?
[3359.96 → 3361.16] Does he know that?
[3361.16 → 3362.42] Did he get the memo?
[3362.92 → 3367.48] Did he get the memo that the PlayStation absolutely killed the Xbox this time around?
[3367.96 → 3370.64] Maybe that's why they're not competition.
[3373.06 → 3374.12] That's one interpretation.
[3374.44 → 3380.52] I actually like the direction Microsoft and Xbox have kind of been going with gaming for a while now.
[3380.60 → 3380.74] Yep.
[3381.26 → 3385.02] The Microsoft Game Pass thing is actually pretty cool.
[3385.10 → 3388.18] And cross licensing between PC and the Xbox console.
[3388.56 → 3390.18] I think they've been making a lot of good steps.
[3390.30 → 3394.58] I don't think that means that the traditional gaming companies are out of position.
[3394.58 → 3400.58] And I don't think that means, I think, not to disrespect, while probably good intentioned,
[3400.58 → 3402.64] was not a very good way to start that sentence.
[3403.74 → 3404.84] I just, I don't know.
[3404.96 → 3406.94] You are still definitely in competition with those guys.
[3407.58 → 3411.54] Even if only part of your business sector is in competition with them,
[3411.72 → 3412.80] you're freaking Microsoft.
[3413.26 → 3415.06] You have a lot of different business sectors.
[3415.44 → 3418.70] You're like Project cloud thing that's invite only,
[3418.70 → 3424.36] is probably more in competition with NVIDIA than Amazon and Google at this point.
[3424.48 → 3428.20] Because Google Stadia is apparently not really going anywhere.
[3428.52 → 3432.26] And judging by how Google does everything, they will probably just drop it.
[3432.76 → 3433.96] I don't know.
[3434.16 → 3435.52] Or they'll carry it forever.
[3435.62 → 3436.22] One of the two.
[3436.28 → 3436.42] Yeah.
[3436.42 → 3441.24] They've had a shocking amount of patience for some stuff that's just kind of terrible.
[3441.24 → 3443.44] Either it will never die, but it will never go anywhere.
[3443.74 → 3444.00] Yeah.
[3444.24 → 3447.20] Or it will completely disappear randomly.
[3448.42 → 3451.28] So, like, and, like, maybe Amazon will actually do something.
[3451.40 → 3453.94] They are pushing a ton of money into that LOTR MMO.
[3454.38 → 3456.46] So maybe you are going to end up going against them.
[3456.54 → 3458.16] But, like, I don't know.
[3458.76 → 3459.44] I don't think.
[3461.42 → 3463.32] I think that statement's a little misguided.
[3463.68 → 3464.26] That's all.
[3464.40 → 3465.62] That's what I'll say there.
[3465.62 → 3466.38] So, yeah.
[3466.52 → 3468.98] Now considers Amazon and Google top rivals.
[3469.40 → 3471.42] Google entered the home gaming market, etc.
[3471.84 → 3473.84] Amazon and Apple offer games on their app stores.
[3473.98 → 3475.22] Apple offers a monthly subscription.
[3475.50 → 3477.48] They do not currently offer a cloud gaming service.
[3478.34 → 3479.56] I mean, the thing is that.
[3479.66 → 3480.44] Neither does Microsoft.
[3480.68 → 3481.32] It's invite only.
[3481.66 → 3484.70] A lot of technology is being built around cloud gaming.
[3485.02 → 3493.26] And I think that there's going to be a lot of time for Nintendo to step in and compete in that market once it's a little bit more mature.
[3493.26 → 3496.06] I feel like they're going to Disney Plus the whole market.
[3496.62 → 3496.98] Nintendo?
[3497.30 → 3497.48] Yeah.
[3498.66 → 3499.76] Do you know what I mean by that?
[3499.78 → 3500.40] Oh, content's king.
[3500.94 → 3501.18] Yeah.
[3501.64 → 3502.76] So they just go, okay.
[3503.10 → 3503.64] You know what?
[3503.70 → 3505.74] Everyone else's, like, game streaming service.
[3505.86 → 3506.44] That's quaint.
[3506.54 → 3507.18] That's nice.
[3507.32 → 3508.36] Good job, you guys.
[3509.26 → 3510.68] We'll come in late to the party.
[3510.88 → 3511.90] Come in late to the party.
[3512.10 → 3517.02] And everyone will go, wow, I really wish I could play that gigantic, massive, epic amount of Nintendo games.
[3517.02 → 3518.90] Endless library of Nintendo games.
[3518.98 → 3520.84] Guess I'll just switch my subscription over to that.
[3521.38 → 3521.66] Yep.
[3522.38 → 3523.96] Yeah, they could easily do that.
[3524.58 → 3525.68] I mean, not easily.
[3526.40 → 3529.20] I mean, the funny thing about Nintendo is they just, like.
[3529.30 → 3530.32] They're slow about stuff.
[3530.84 → 3532.12] Man, like, even multiplayer.
[3532.12 → 3533.84] And they're not very good at, like, internet.
[3534.02 → 3535.46] Like, it took them forever, you know?
[3535.58 → 3537.40] They're not very good at internet things.
[3537.52 → 3537.86] They're not.
[3537.94 → 3538.72] I feel like.
[3538.94 → 3540.04] But I could see them doing it late.
[3540.14 → 3542.94] They'd have to be able to figure it out at some point, you know?
[3543.00 → 3543.52] I think they will.
[3543.56 → 3545.60] I mean, they have enough money to buy the Earth and all the heavens.
[3545.60 → 3547.68] But that's why I said Disney Plus it.
[3547.78 → 3550.40] Because Netflix has been around and dominating for a long time.
[3550.42 → 3550.86] Yeah, that's true.
[3550.86 → 3555.36] And then Prime came in and was around for a long time before Disney Plus actually entered.
[3555.84 → 3556.32] So they could.
[3556.78 → 3559.38] Nintendo could enter many years late.
[3559.78 → 3562.96] And I still think they would dominate the second they showed up on the scene.
[3564.94 → 3565.70] All right.
[3565.90 → 3568.32] We have time for a handful of Super Chats today.
[3569.40 → 3569.68] Let's.
[3570.26 → 3571.68] Thanks, Thomas Jorgensen.
[3572.54 → 3573.94] Thanks, your average tech.
[3574.52 → 3578.04] What's the average amount of bandwidth you recommend I get for my Minecraft?
[3578.12 → 3579.42] Someone on phone plane chat said,
[3579.42 → 3581.48] Nintendo is a dead horse that needs to be buried.
[3581.80 → 3582.06] No.
[3582.30 → 3582.80] Nintendo is a what?
[3583.00 → 3584.36] Dead horse that needs to be buried.
[3584.78 → 3585.96] They're doing fantastic.
[3586.10 → 3587.10] Yeah, they're doing just fine.
[3587.20 → 3588.50] And honestly, the Switch is amazing.
[3588.52 → 3590.48] Like a hundred million Switches or something stupid like that.
[3590.48 → 3591.26] Some crazy amount.
[3591.78 → 3591.98] Ridiculous.
[3591.98 → 3592.96] Switch is doing amazing.
[3593.18 → 3593.70] Ridiculous.
[3593.70 → 3596.74] They got their fitness thing back because Ring Fit is actually doing really well.
[3597.18 → 3598.42] And is apparently like very fun.
[3599.24 → 3599.92] Like that's cool.
[3600.06 → 3600.64] They figured it out.
[3600.86 → 3601.92] They dropped that on the Wii U.
[3602.04 → 3602.98] They picked it back up again.
[3605.16 → 3606.04] All right.
[3606.32 → 3609.18] I have no idea how much bandwidth you need for your Minecraft.
[3609.18 → 3611.76] It really just depends on how many people connect to it.
[3611.86 → 3612.80] But what about dedicated RAM?
[3613.76 → 3614.06] Huh?
[3614.20 → 3614.38] What?
[3614.66 → 3616.42] Dedicated RAM as opposed to what kind of RAM?
[3616.42 → 3618.88] How much dedicated RAM does he need for his Minecraft?
[3619.24 → 3619.40] What?
[3619.92 → 3621.22] You don't understand that reference?
[3622.00 → 3623.24] He didn't ask that.
[3623.66 → 3624.06] I know.
[3624.38 → 3625.24] It's a joke.
[3625.34 → 3625.92] Don't worry about it.
[3626.44 → 3627.64] Multiple people in chat get it.
[3627.66 → 3627.96] It's fine.
[3628.04 → 3630.22] Thanks, Petrotsky2007.
[3630.22 → 3632.82] Thanks, James HUAC.
[3633.98 → 3635.26] What else we got here?
[3637.34 → 3638.82] Big hello from Terrace BC.
[3639.16 → 3639.36] Hey.
[3639.90 → 3640.18] Hey.
[3642.52 → 3646.34] Manoj Mahendra says, since subscribing in 2012, pretty much watched most of your videos.
[3646.38 → 3647.10] What do you mean most?
[3647.10 → 3652.70] Really cool to see your company's growth and the 10 million subscription was in Surrey for Christmas.
[3652.82 → 3653.70] Thought about gate crashing.
[3654.56 → 3656.52] That probably wouldn't be best.
[3656.86 → 3658.20] Just throwing that out there.
[3659.70 → 3660.88] Thank you for not doing that.
[3661.42 → 3664.12] Ricardo says, lived in Kamloops in the early 2000s.
[3664.16 → 3665.90] Wish I was enjoying the cold there with you guys.
[3666.86 → 3667.94] Thank you very much.
[3668.12 → 3669.72] And yeah, it's been sort of lame.
[3670.92 → 3672.54] Actually, it's been a little warmer the last little bit.
[3672.80 → 3673.92] But then it got kind of cold again.
[3674.28 → 3675.12] Mostly it's the wet.
[3675.16 → 3678.94] The wet sucks in the Pacific Northwest.
[3680.22 → 3680.70] All right.
[3681.48 → 3685.12] Brian says, car as a service won't work in rural without solutions.
[3685.78 → 3686.38] Well, yeah.
[3686.38 → 3688.18] They will come up with solutions.
[3688.40 → 3693.82] And as always, things will take longer to roll out in rural areas.
[3693.82 → 3698.86] I mean, we might need to wait until cars have, you know, 1,000, 2,000-mile range or whatever the case may be.
[3698.98 → 3714.64] Or there might be adapted solutions for rural areas where, you know, instead of a standard car, it's like an extended, extended, extended range model that's basically, you know, the entire trunk and hood is just full of batteries.
[3714.84 → 3716.20] You know, whatever the solution is.
[3716.64 → 3717.48] There will be a solution.
[3717.70 → 3718.44] They'll figure it out.
[3718.44 → 3726.10] But, you know, whatever it is, whether we're talking paved roads, broadband internet, it's always taken longer to roll out to rural communities.
[3726.10 → 3726.78] I was just going to say.
[3727.12 → 3728.18] And it always shows up eventually.
[3728.30 → 3730.02] I'm not talking in my lifetime.
[3730.24 → 3735.32] I'm talking in the amount of time that I have made YouTube videos with the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[3735.32 → 3743.82] People related to me have lived on farmland that they had to trickle download the videos over, like, the course of over a day.
[3743.94 → 3744.24] Yeah, yeah.
[3744.24 → 3746.44] Because they're on, like, dial-up so they could watch it.
[3747.22 → 3748.14] Now they have broadband.
[3748.50 → 3749.10] Now they have broadband.
[3749.22 → 3750.14] It happens over time.
[3750.94 → 3751.44] All right.
[3751.80 → 3757.50] Speaking of happening every time, the show has to end eventually every time, 60% of the time.
[3757.74 → 3759.30] So thank you guys for tuning in.
[3759.62 → 3760.64] We'll see you again next week.
[3760.80 → 3763.00] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3763.58 → 3763.98] Bye!
[3763.98 → 3767.50] I wonder if at some point I'm going to get in trouble for that.
[3767.78 → 3768.02] Maybe.
[3768.18 → 3769.84] And that would be an issue because it's on, like, every WAN show.
[3769.84 → 3770.26] Yeah, I know.
[3770.34 → 3772.54] We'd have to just, like, pull the entire WAN show.
[3772.54 → 3772.82] Yeah.
[3773.08 → 3773.26] Yeah.
[3774.98 → 3775.80] Oh, wait.
[3775.92 → 3777.14] No, I have to stop this one first.
