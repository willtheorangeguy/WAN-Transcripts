[0.00 --> 1.52]  Unless we team up with Yvonne and Chase.
[2.20 --> 4.94]  Hey, welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[5.08 --> 7.84]  We've got a fantastic show for y'all today.
[7.96 --> 12.46]  A lot of big topics, including, of course, third time's the charm.
[12.62 --> 19.80]  AMD announced their Ryzen 5000 series of processors that looks absolutely well.
[19.94 --> 23.36]  To put it simply, freaking incredible.
[24.06 --> 28.40]  Like, if half of what they said is true and accurate,
[28.40 --> 31.54]  this is going to be an absolute game changer.
[32.04 --> 36.80]  Also, we've got some drama in the data recovery space.
[37.38 --> 41.48]  So, we did, recently, we did a sponsored video with Drive Savers,
[41.92 --> 46.52]  where one of the things that we talked about was a recent fix for the iPhone
[46.52 --> 49.12]  that Drive Savers says they figured out.
[49.24 --> 52.60]  And then we've actually got some other folks in the data recovery
[52.60 --> 54.38]  and device repair community that are saying,
[54.58 --> 57.16]  actually, that wasn't them.
[57.16 --> 58.48]  So, we're going to get into that.
[58.62 --> 59.28]  What else we got?
[59.98 --> 60.98]  Very interesting, very interesting.
[61.08 --> 64.22]  There's a PS5 teardown that's been getting memed a little bit,
[64.36 --> 66.28]  but it's still very interesting.
[66.36 --> 67.06]  What do you mean memed?
[67.06 --> 67.64]  It's awesome.
[68.70 --> 69.98]  It has been memed a little bit.
[70.06 --> 70.34]  Really?
[70.46 --> 70.96]  By Xbox.
[71.38 --> 71.56]  Yeah.
[71.74 --> 72.48]  Oh, whatever.
[73.26 --> 74.82]  I don't necessarily agree with the meming,
[74.96 --> 76.88]  but we'll get into it either way.
[77.18 --> 79.00]  Starlink is entering the public beta soon.
[79.00 --> 83.16]  And I thought I had something else that was cool that I wanted to bring up.
[83.56 --> 84.56]  Oh, the MSI drama.
[84.80 --> 85.10]  Yeah.
[85.26 --> 85.86]  More drama.
[86.10 --> 89.50]  It's going to be a drama, drama llama show today.
[89.62 --> 89.72]  Yeah.
[89.74 --> 90.24]  I'm excited.
[90.44 --> 90.82]  I'm excited.
[90.90 --> 91.44]  It's going to be fun.
[91.44 --> 121.42]  It's going to be fun.
[122.24 --> 123.20]  Oh, man.
[123.46 --> 124.04]  It's broken.
[124.30 --> 125.34]  Add Squarespace.
[126.74 --> 127.00]  Woo.
[127.68 --> 128.08]  Hold on.
[128.12 --> 129.04]  I got to fix this.
[129.36 --> 130.32]  There we go.
[130.62 --> 130.98]  Line salute.
[133.38 --> 137.10]  Oh, when you're your own producer on a live show, it's the best.
[137.58 --> 137.90]  Someday.
[138.00 --> 140.04]  Someday, maybe I'll hire a producer.
[140.24 --> 140.64]  Just kidding.
[141.08 --> 141.52]  All right.
[141.52 --> 144.44]  This was posted by William CLL on the forum,
[145.04 --> 148.78]  and AMD's Where Gaming Begins event was kind of a big deal.
[148.86 --> 150.26]  Luke, have you looked at this yet?
[152.14 --> 152.64]  That's fine.
[152.78 --> 153.24]  That's fine.
[153.30 --> 154.22]  I'm going to walk you through it.
[154.28 --> 155.08]  It's huge.
[155.66 --> 159.94]  So AMD is taking such a big leap forward here that they are just,
[160.10 --> 162.54]  they're just skipping 4,000 series.
[162.72 --> 164.10]  They're just skipping it on the desktop.
[164.10 --> 167.00]  They're going straight from Ryzen 3,000 to Ryzen 5,000.
[167.00 --> 169.32]  And actually, I think the reason they're doing that is more to do with that.
[169.58 --> 174.50]  They mucked up the branding on the notebook side, calling Zen 2 Ryzen 4,000.
[174.68 --> 177.04]  So then it's like, oh boy, now what are we going to do?
[177.08 --> 182.42]  Are we going to have like this 1,000 disparity between laptop and desktop forever?
[182.60 --> 183.10]  No, we're not.
[183.14 --> 184.66]  We're just going to make everything 5,000.
[184.80 --> 185.36]  Love it.
[185.90 --> 186.88]  This has happened a few times.
[186.92 --> 189.20]  That happened with the 800 series on NVIDIA's side.
[189.34 --> 189.84]  Yeah, so dumb.
[189.84 --> 199.74]  Anyway, so where gaming begins, they announced the Ryzen 9 5950X, 5900X, 5800X, and 5600X.
[199.86 --> 203.38]  Those are 16, 12, 8, and 6 core processors respectively,
[203.74 --> 209.46]  with anywhere from 35 megabytes of cache all the way up to 72 megabytes of cache,
[209.76 --> 214.22]  and boost clocks from 4.6 all the way up to 4.9 gigahertz.
[214.22 --> 221.02]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, AMD is getting dangerously close to the 5 gigahertz barrier.
[222.02 --> 226.24]  Impressively, they are not only running at these high clock speeds,
[226.38 --> 229.92]  but they are doing it within the same TDP as their predecessors.
[230.14 --> 236.04]  So they're all rated for 105 watts down to the 8 core and 65 watts for the 6 core.
[236.22 --> 236.88]  Like, dang.
[237.40 --> 240.76]  Like, looking at the single-threaded performance that they're claiming on these things,
[240.76 --> 245.10]  like, one of those six cores and, like, a nice small form factor machine,
[245.32 --> 247.14]  it's like 65 watts?
[247.54 --> 248.40]  That's incredible.
[248.84 --> 249.88]  It's exciting, you know?
[250.24 --> 252.74]  Puts the excitement back in CPUs again.
[253.38 --> 258.08]  And the bigger deal, of course, is not the clock speeds or the cores.
[258.24 --> 260.94]  I mean, AMD has already been a leader when it comes to core count.
[261.30 --> 266.08]  The bigger deal is the improvement in per-clock efficiency,
[266.08 --> 271.08]  so how much performance they can actually get out of each clock cycle.
[271.24 --> 278.40]  And they are apparently claiming a 19% lift in instructions per clock.
[279.38 --> 279.86]  Wild.
[280.20 --> 281.02]  Like, two generations.
[281.38 --> 282.56]  That is massive.
[282.68 --> 283.32]  Well, it depends.
[283.48 --> 284.96]  I mean, are we talking Intel generations?
[285.14 --> 286.96]  Because then it's like four.
[287.74 --> 288.94]  It's like four, Luke.
[289.34 --> 289.66]  Okay?
[289.94 --> 291.86]  Which generations are we looking at here?
[292.44 --> 294.16]  Star Trek generations?
[294.16 --> 297.80]  Because then it's probably a little less.
[298.02 --> 298.34]  It's probably...
[298.34 --> 300.82]  I think the technology moves a little faster in Star Trek
[300.82 --> 301.98]  than it does over at Team Blue.
[303.10 --> 306.82]  AMD is claiming that these new CPUs are going to beat Intel,
[307.06 --> 308.32]  sometimes by a lot,
[308.52 --> 311.12]  in not only productivity, where they've already been strong,
[311.30 --> 312.62]  but also gaming.
[313.36 --> 314.64]  That's the big winner, in my opinion.
[315.04 --> 318.38]  AMD is claiming they're going to be 20% faster than Intel
[318.38 --> 320.36]  in Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
[320.36 --> 323.52]  Because one of the crazy things is they already won over gamers
[323.52 --> 325.80]  by just being, like, better overall.
[326.86 --> 330.48]  Like, a lot of gamers were sacrificing the performance difference in games.
[330.58 --> 330.76]  Yeah.
[330.84 --> 331.86]  And just being like, whatever.
[332.08 --> 333.42]  I might end up streaming.
[333.54 --> 335.04]  I might end up doing something else,
[335.06 --> 336.56]  which is going to take more of the processor as a whole.
[336.72 --> 338.36]  I'll go for the AMD option.
[338.64 --> 340.76]  And now that it's better in both categories,
[340.76 --> 342.46]  it's like...
[342.46 --> 343.92]  Oh, man.
[343.92 --> 348.74]  So, as of the launch of the 5000 series,
[348.94 --> 351.60]  assuming that all of this is correct,
[352.14 --> 355.48]  AMD will hold the following advantages over Intel.
[356.14 --> 357.58]  Multi-threaded performance.
[360.76 --> 361.98]  Bang for the buck.
[363.16 --> 364.24]  Cheaper motherboards.
[365.84 --> 367.94]  Potentially single-threaded performance.
[367.94 --> 372.74]  And the CSGO benchmark specifically
[372.74 --> 374.68]  has been something that's been hanging over their head
[374.68 --> 375.64]  for a really long time.
[375.80 --> 376.76]  Storage performance.
[377.08 --> 378.26]  PCI Express Gen 4,
[378.36 --> 381.72]  which all of a sudden is being thrown into the limelight.
[382.20 --> 384.16]  Like, here we've got Sony and Microsoft
[384.16 --> 385.76]  launching these new consoles,
[385.94 --> 387.46]  and they're saying next-generation games
[387.46 --> 389.68]  are going to really take advantage of high-speed storage.
[390.94 --> 391.38]  And...
[391.38 --> 392.32]  Sup, yo!
[392.96 --> 394.06]  How you doing?
[394.06 --> 397.98]  What's hanging?
[398.12 --> 399.44]  I don't know why he decided to come hang out,
[399.56 --> 400.30]  but he did.
[400.46 --> 402.28]  I heard you weren't feeling good last night.
[403.16 --> 404.64]  Yeah, he's been sick,
[405.02 --> 406.82]  but he seems to be doing a little bit better.
[407.30 --> 408.16]  He always gets excited...
[408.16 --> 408.82]  Oh, there we go.
[409.22 --> 410.96]  He always gets excited when I talk a lot.
[411.14 --> 413.36]  He likes, like, loud conversation,
[413.36 --> 415.38]  so he seems to love Wancho every day.
[415.68 --> 416.08]  Sweet, dude.
[416.08 --> 417.54]  So, like, get a little bit more animated,
[417.68 --> 418.30]  and he's like, yeah!
[418.48 --> 418.88]  Yeah!
[419.16 --> 419.84]  Rock on!
[420.38 --> 421.84]  Yeah, shake your tail, baby!
[422.44 --> 422.82]  All right.
[422.82 --> 424.72]  So, right.
[424.90 --> 426.90]  So, high-speed SSDs are all of a sudden
[426.90 --> 428.40]  becoming a major factor,
[428.56 --> 430.58]  a big consideration for future games,
[430.70 --> 432.50]  and, hey, cold hard truth is
[432.50 --> 435.20]  not everybody is, you know, me,
[435.36 --> 437.70]  and is upgrading their hardware every cycle, right?
[438.02 --> 439.08]  For most people,
[439.16 --> 440.54]  I think it's pretty fair to say
[440.54 --> 442.94]  that anywhere from three to eight years
[442.94 --> 444.62]  is as long as you could expect
[444.62 --> 445.78]  to be using a gaming rig,
[445.80 --> 446.82]  and you might make a couple...
[446.82 --> 447.00]  Yeah.
[447.08 --> 448.80]  ...a couple key upgrades in that time.
[448.90 --> 450.08]  Oh, I need a bit more storage
[450.08 --> 452.00]  because the new Modern Warfare
[452.00 --> 453.96]  is 600 terabytes.
[453.96 --> 454.68]  ...a hard drive.
[454.78 --> 455.42]  Yeah, exactly.
[455.88 --> 457.72]  Okay, so you need some more storage.
[458.14 --> 459.72]  You know, NVIDIA SoftFit
[459.72 --> 462.06]  to grant us a new graphics card,
[462.14 --> 462.90]  finally, you know,
[462.94 --> 464.08]  maybe upgrade to one of those.
[464.38 --> 465.10]  That sort of thing.
[465.22 --> 467.00]  But in terms of the core platform,
[467.22 --> 468.70]  you expect to be able to use it
[468.70 --> 469.84]  for quite some time.
[469.84 --> 474.14]  And so if I was buying a system today,
[474.30 --> 476.62]  PCI Express Gen 4 went from,
[476.98 --> 477.44]  eh, whatever,
[477.92 --> 480.68]  to, wow, that is a major consideration
[480.68 --> 482.02]  if I want my gaming rig
[482.02 --> 484.84]  to be able to play these next-gen console games
[484.84 --> 486.74]  that aren't going to stay console-exclusive forever.
[487.06 --> 489.16]  Speaking of the longevity of the platform,
[489.56 --> 490.86]  advantage number six
[490.86 --> 493.04]  is intergenerational compatibility.
[493.36 --> 496.88]  Now, AMD did kind of tick off the community
[496.88 --> 499.94]  based on what they had initially promised
[499.94 --> 503.68]  when they went back on 300 series motherboards
[503.68 --> 507.50]  having support for this upcoming generation of processors.
[507.90 --> 509.20]  If I recall correctly,
[509.26 --> 511.16]  I can't remember exactly which generation
[511.16 --> 513.08]  AMD was, like, not going to support
[513.08 --> 513.88]  and then people were mad.
[514.28 --> 515.18]  Maybe it was B450?
[515.78 --> 516.90]  Okay, doesn't matter.
[517.00 --> 517.64]  The point is,
[517.72 --> 520.16]  AMD did let folks down a little bit,
[520.22 --> 521.42]  but then if I recall correctly,
[521.52 --> 523.04]  again, they ended up making it right
[523.04 --> 526.30]  and they are still definitely holding an advantage
[526.30 --> 527.78]  over Intel in this regard.
[527.88 --> 529.88]  Intel has been real strict
[529.88 --> 531.76]  for, like, pretty much the last 10 years.
[532.20 --> 533.86]  Okay, you get a chipset
[533.86 --> 537.02]  and then the chipset that launches with that CPU,
[537.54 --> 539.76]  that chipset might get one more CPU
[539.76 --> 541.60]  and then that's it.
[542.14 --> 544.02]  It's been pretty much on that cadence
[544.02 --> 545.90]  and even if the socket doesn't change,
[546.18 --> 547.84]  and in some cases, I do understand
[547.84 --> 551.06]  there were actual engineering considerations
[551.06 --> 552.92]  that made it so that they didn't want to just say,
[552.92 --> 554.86]  okay, it's a free-for-all,
[555.10 --> 557.64]  sure, put Coffee Lake on this, do that.
[557.84 --> 559.04]  I get it, I get it.
[559.82 --> 561.66]  But that doesn't change that
[561.66 --> 563.28]  from a competitive standpoint,
[563.52 --> 564.32]  they're behind AMD,
[564.48 --> 567.66]  who has had as much as three generations of CPUs
[567.66 --> 570.44]  now be available on a single motherboard.
[570.64 --> 571.56]  That's crazy,
[571.96 --> 574.18]  and it looks like that's going to continue.
[574.40 --> 577.20]  So the 500 series boards that are out there now
[577.20 --> 579.94]  are not only going to be compatible with Verizon 5000,
[579.94 --> 582.08]  they're supposed to be drop-in compatible.
[582.26 --> 584.02]  AMD has apparently been stealthily
[584.02 --> 585.72]  putting in the microcode
[585.72 --> 587.54]  that's needed for these upcoming processors,
[588.40 --> 590.12]  and so if you've updated your BIOS
[590.12 --> 590.92]  in the last little bit,
[591.02 --> 592.02]  it is quite possible
[592.02 --> 595.34]  that you will just chuck a 5000 series CPU in there.
[595.40 --> 596.70]  Don't chuck it, please put it in nicely.
[597.44 --> 598.54]  And you're ready to rock.
[599.70 --> 601.16]  Can we think of any more advantages?
[601.34 --> 602.50]  Did I already say cheaper motherboards?
[603.38 --> 603.94]  You did.
[604.02 --> 604.52]  I think I did.
[604.60 --> 605.40]  Okay, number six.
[605.48 --> 607.32]  I mean, let's brainstorm here, ladies and gentlemen.
[607.44 --> 608.08]  What else we got?
[608.16 --> 608.58]  What else we got?
[608.62 --> 609.68]  Let's head over to the float plane chat.
[609.68 --> 609.98]  By the way,
[610.00 --> 611.76]  if you're not subscribed to LTT on float plane,
[611.80 --> 612.52]  you got to get over there
[612.52 --> 614.62]  because we got early access.
[614.88 --> 616.10]  We got behind the scenes.
[616.66 --> 618.34]  Now is genuinely the best time
[618.34 --> 620.62]  to subscribe to LTT float plane
[620.62 --> 622.24]  that I think there's ever been
[622.24 --> 625.20]  because you guys are pumping the exclusives.
[625.48 --> 626.74]  Yeah, Ed's been doing a great job.
[626.94 --> 629.08]  He's even just did weird test footage
[629.08 --> 629.96]  and stuff like that.
[630.06 --> 631.14]  He's been chucking it on there.
[631.70 --> 635.22]  The we're taking things slow video was so cool.
[635.80 --> 636.84]  There's no audio.
[637.16 --> 637.92]  There's no intro.
[638.42 --> 639.28]  There's just nothing.
[639.28 --> 640.64]  It's just slow-mo footage
[640.64 --> 642.46]  randomly stitched together in a row.
[642.72 --> 644.08]  I was like, this is great.
[644.40 --> 645.62]  We just got a high-speed camera.
[646.32 --> 648.74]  So we finally, yeah, we've rented them before,
[648.84 --> 650.64]  but we finally actually own one.
[651.18 --> 651.78]  What did you get?
[652.04 --> 654.78]  We got, oh, bloody hell, what's it called?
[656.58 --> 658.48]  Kronos high-speed camera.
[659.42 --> 660.50]  What's their new one called?
[660.58 --> 664.70]  The Kronos 2.1 HD from Krontek.
[665.26 --> 666.86]  We did a tour of their facility
[666.86 --> 668.68]  like way back a thousand years ago.
[668.68 --> 669.68]  They're still around.
[670.42 --> 672.24]  So Kronos 2.1.
[672.46 --> 673.28]  Yeah, yeah.
[673.36 --> 674.50]  So it's only like five grand,
[674.66 --> 676.46]  but it does, I think,
[676.62 --> 680.18]  either 720 or 1080 at a thousand frames per second.
[680.64 --> 682.74]  And a thousand frames per second is sort of the,
[682.86 --> 684.78]  yeah, 1080 at a thousand frames per second.
[684.78 --> 686.82]  So that's sort of the magic number for us
[686.82 --> 690.24]  because when it comes to evaluating things like monitors,
[690.86 --> 695.80]  a thousand frames per second is one millisecond per frame.
[696.18 --> 698.84]  So if we wanted to do something like investigate
[698.84 --> 701.86]  the gray-to-gray response times
[701.86 --> 705.82]  of the pixels of a monitor or something like that,
[705.84 --> 707.52]  it's just really easily divisible.
[707.78 --> 711.52]  So we used it actually today in a really cool video.
[711.52 --> 714.88]  I was really annoyed with LG for not getting us
[714.88 --> 718.66]  their new C10 48-inch, well, months ago
[718.66 --> 721.24]  because we've been asking for it for months.
[721.68 --> 724.02]  And so we couldn't even get a sample to review.
[724.36 --> 726.82]  And then meanwhile, there's like sponsored videos
[726.82 --> 728.62]  with other people going up about it.
[728.64 --> 729.64]  And I'm like, for real,
[730.06 --> 732.64]  you guys can't find one TV to send us
[732.64 --> 735.40]  where we just want to make editorial content
[735.40 --> 737.14]  because we're really excited about it.
[737.22 --> 738.48]  And you got to send it to people
[738.48 --> 739.76]  who needed to be paid to make the video.
[739.82 --> 740.86]  What are you guys even doing?
[740.86 --> 744.36]  Like at what point do I just have to apply for a job there
[744.36 --> 746.24]  so I can show you guys all how this is done?
[746.52 --> 748.08]  Like for crying out loud.
[750.38 --> 752.76]  Honestly, hey, you know, I applied at Amazon, right?
[753.22 --> 754.18]  Like way back in the day.
[755.20 --> 756.80]  I'll remind me to tell that story later.
[756.84 --> 757.86]  I'll tell that story later anyway.
[759.52 --> 763.10]  So anyway, we used it today for our C10 video
[763.10 --> 766.82]  and it was so cool because we were able to use the,
[766.82 --> 769.46]  we were able to use the high-speed camera.
[769.46 --> 771.52]  So instead of doing a pursuit setup,
[772.12 --> 773.92]  we actually just had a stationary camera
[773.92 --> 775.26]  while the UFOs went across
[775.26 --> 777.88]  and it's running at such a high frame rate
[777.88 --> 781.02]  that we can actually just see the pixels changing.
[781.52 --> 784.14]  So OLED, one of the great things about that technology
[784.14 --> 786.92]  is how quickly the pixels shift
[786.92 --> 789.34]  compared to something like an IPS LCD,
[789.50 --> 790.74]  even a very high-speed one.
[791.00 --> 794.18]  So we whipped out a 360 hertz gaming monitor
[794.18 --> 797.32]  and then we had our OLED running at 120 hertz
[797.32 --> 798.94]  and we tried them at-
[798.94 --> 799.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[799.96 --> 800.18]  Okay.
[800.44 --> 802.24]  So we tried them at various refresh rates,
[802.36 --> 804.20]  60 and 60, 120 and 120,
[804.52 --> 808.06]  and then 120 versus 240 and 120 versus 360
[808.06 --> 812.92]  to see at what point does refreshing the LCD faster
[812.92 --> 816.78]  overcome the slower pixel response times?
[816.78 --> 820.14]  Because even on a one millisecond LCD panel,
[820.80 --> 822.38]  come on, get real.
[822.70 --> 823.42]  It's not even close.
[823.58 --> 824.70]  And we can see that.
[824.76 --> 826.18]  We can see that on the high-speed camera.
[826.30 --> 827.74]  So it's pretty exciting.
[828.10 --> 829.84]  I'm jazzed to show you guys that video.
[829.94 --> 831.86]  That'll definitely be early access on Floatplane.
[832.04 --> 833.18]  So coming around full circle,
[833.26 --> 834.36]  make sure you're subscribed to Floatplane.
[834.82 --> 835.84]  That's the camera we got
[835.84 --> 837.04]  that I just showed you guys, by the way.
[837.12 --> 837.86]  It's pretty sick.
[837.94 --> 839.16]  Those guys are a local company.
[839.42 --> 841.20]  So feel free to check them out.
[841.32 --> 842.92]  Don't expect to get a camera anytime soon.
[843.02 --> 845.04]  They've had some serious supply chain issues
[845.04 --> 845.60]  due to COVID.
[845.74 --> 848.02]  That's one of the reasons it took us so long to get it
[848.02 --> 849.78]  because ever since we did those collabs
[849.78 --> 851.10]  with Gav from Slow Mo Guys
[851.10 --> 855.14]  and with Shroud, Mr. Grims, Corey, and Paul
[855.14 --> 857.88]  for the, like, does high refresh rate gaming
[857.88 --> 859.12]  help your abilities?
[859.40 --> 860.88]  We've been trying to get our hands on one
[860.88 --> 861.74]  and I just didn't want to,
[861.80 --> 864.18]  I just didn't want to deal with A, the cost
[864.18 --> 865.90]  and B, the hassle of Phantom.
[866.64 --> 868.56]  Like, it is not easy to work with.
[868.62 --> 870.54]  I do not envy Gav.
[870.64 --> 871.86]  He's very successful.
[871.86 --> 875.28]  He's basically, like, a real celebrity at this point.
[876.08 --> 877.18]  You know, him and Dan.
[877.32 --> 880.94]  And I'm just like, yep, got no desire for your life
[880.94 --> 882.26]  because that looks horrible.
[882.64 --> 884.92]  Just dealing with that slow-mo footage all the time.
[885.10 --> 886.84]  And they do so much of the work themselves.
[888.36 --> 891.70]  So back to AMD and all the various advantages
[891.70 --> 892.26]  that they have.
[892.30 --> 893.98]  I never actually ended up looking at the chat.
[893.98 --> 897.10]  My one quick thing before I go forward
[897.10 --> 899.90]  is one of my favorite things about Flowplane
[899.90 --> 901.96]  is, like, the comment section on this slow-mo video.
[902.26 --> 905.56]  It's like I said, it's just no audio, no intro, no outro,
[905.74 --> 907.54]  just random stitched-together slow-mo footage.
[907.70 --> 907.90]  Yeah.
[908.20 --> 910.08]  All the comments are like, this is great.
[910.74 --> 911.46]  I know.
[911.64 --> 913.38]  The Flowplane community is so positive.
[914.08 --> 915.18]  They're so nice.
[915.56 --> 916.12]  Here, okay, here.
[916.48 --> 918.06]  I'll tease a little bit of it.
[918.64 --> 921.02]  So this is just Ed playing around with the slow-mo camera.
[921.12 --> 923.84]  The image quality is actually not bad.
[924.74 --> 925.30]  Like...
[925.30 --> 926.74]  It looks really good.
[927.00 --> 929.48]  Yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
[929.48 --> 931.82]  This is exactly what we needed.
[931.92 --> 933.88]  So you can expect to see more of this kind of stuff
[933.88 --> 934.74]  in upcoming videos.
[936.32 --> 938.64]  I'm surprised Dennis didn't, like, scare himself.
[939.36 --> 940.86]  Actually, look on his face.
[940.90 --> 941.54]  He probably did.
[941.98 --> 942.56]  What a nerd.
[942.98 --> 943.66]  I love that guy.
[944.60 --> 946.80]  I wonder how many FPS this is at.
[947.38 --> 949.74]  We can actually turn down the resolution
[949.74 --> 953.30]  and get even greater frame rates if we really want to.
[953.30 --> 955.46]  So I think it can...
[955.46 --> 959.40]  We did some at 3,000 FPS earlier today.
[961.34 --> 963.32]  Why does he have a plastic gun?
[963.52 --> 964.88]  What even am I looking at?
[966.54 --> 966.90]  Okay.
[968.54 --> 968.94]  Jeez.
[969.78 --> 971.30]  Sorry, I haven't actually seen this.
[971.36 --> 974.66]  I don't even, like, review some of the things that they upload.
[974.82 --> 975.90]  Look at the look on his face.
[975.96 --> 977.04]  Like, it's a balloon, Dennis.
[977.04 --> 979.72]  Just chill, dude.
[983.12 --> 984.24]  That's pretty fun, though.
[984.66 --> 985.28]  It's cool.
[985.62 --> 985.84]  Yeah.
[986.16 --> 986.54]  All right.
[986.62 --> 989.52]  I love how Rod is, like, in the comments
[989.52 --> 992.26]  criticizing the, like, bit versus drill usage.
[993.06 --> 994.34]  Oh, come on, Rod.
[994.34 --> 995.28]  Just chill.
[998.54 --> 999.28]  That's great.
[999.48 --> 1000.08]  I love it.
[1000.58 --> 1001.06]  All right.
[1001.80 --> 1003.76]  What else are we looking at?
[1003.76 --> 1005.82]  Okay, so back to AMD.
[1006.88 --> 1008.16]  So advantages for Intel.
[1008.50 --> 1010.56]  Why don't we change gears and talk about their advantages?
[1011.28 --> 1015.50]  Intel teased their upcoming Rocket Lake 11th Gen processors.
[1015.94 --> 1018.76]  It is rumored to be a 14 nanometer variant
[1018.76 --> 1020.38]  of the new Willow Cove architecture,
[1020.56 --> 1021.86]  which Tiger Lake is based on.
[1022.16 --> 1024.50]  So we could be getting faster onboard video.
[1028.60 --> 1029.12]  Cool.
[1030.84 --> 1031.36]  Nice.
[1031.92 --> 1032.40]  Nice.
[1032.40 --> 1034.18]  Good win, guys.
[1034.34 --> 1034.70]  Nice.
[1035.44 --> 1035.88]  Nice.
[1036.52 --> 1038.12]  I mean, we also might get, like,
[1038.18 --> 1041.74]  RDNA 2 onboard video from AMD and upcoming APUs.
[1041.96 --> 1043.50]  So, like, but still.
[1043.90 --> 1044.24]  Nice.
[1044.36 --> 1044.76]  Nice.
[1044.98 --> 1045.26]  Nice.
[1046.20 --> 1046.78]  I am.
[1046.80 --> 1047.94]  Someone made a comment earlier,
[1048.10 --> 1050.36]  and it sucks that the Rocket Lake thing's coming
[1050.36 --> 1053.30]  because they were calling it Coffin Lake in Twitch chat.
[1053.52 --> 1054.60]  And I thought that was pretty great.
[1055.04 --> 1055.18]  Okay.
[1055.18 --> 1056.10]  When I was talking earlier,
[1056.10 --> 1057.52]  I was talking about Coffee Lake,
[1057.68 --> 1058.56]  not Coffin Lake.
[1058.56 --> 1058.66]  I know.
[1058.74 --> 1059.06]  I know.
[1059.20 --> 1059.38]  I know.
[1059.50 --> 1060.20]  Coffin Lake.
[1060.20 --> 1061.40]  I just thought it was cool.
[1061.40 --> 1063.68]  Oh, what a creepy place to hang out on a weekend that would be.
[1064.76 --> 1067.12]  Honestly, though, I like Desperate Intel.
[1067.74 --> 1071.90]  I like Against the Ropes Intel a lot better than I like Complacent Intel
[1071.90 --> 1075.00]  because that's what it takes to get through to the suits.
[1075.42 --> 1077.20]  And if that's what it takes, fine.
[1077.36 --> 1080.04]  Because every other time Intel's been up against the ropes,
[1080.18 --> 1082.40]  they have come back swinging hard.
[1082.40 --> 1087.26]  So has Intel had all their good brains drained away?
[1087.58 --> 1088.22]  I don't know.
[1088.38 --> 1089.58]  We're going to find out soon enough
[1089.58 --> 1092.44]  because I'm sure they're going to need a way to come back
[1092.44 --> 1094.66]  and make a splash here sometime in the next.
[1095.06 --> 1096.90]  I mean, the thing about it, guys, is that like,
[1097.82 --> 1100.40]  oh, man, there's so many things for them to overcome.
[1100.58 --> 1104.82]  Oh, advantage number seven is AMD's approach to CPU design
[1104.82 --> 1107.72]  with their chiplets allows them apparently
[1107.72 --> 1109.86]  to be much more efficient about product development
[1109.86 --> 1113.14]  and work on multiple different cores in parallel
[1113.14 --> 1117.34]  to the point where apparently they were able to just drop
[1117.34 --> 1120.52]  these new Zen 3 cores onto the same substrate
[1120.52 --> 1122.78]  that they were using for Ryzen 3000 series
[1122.78 --> 1126.72]  with the same IO die and just like, okay, here we go.
[1127.16 --> 1128.36]  Like, that's incredible.
[1128.50 --> 1130.12]  Obviously, it wasn't quite that simple.
[1130.50 --> 1134.12]  Like, there's a lot of engineering that goes into getting something
[1134.12 --> 1135.28]  like that working just right.
[1136.32 --> 1137.66]  Actually, advantage Intel.
[1137.66 --> 1140.88]  I really hope that AMD does a better job
[1140.88 --> 1142.84]  with virtualization this time around.
[1143.30 --> 1145.30]  It was and it can be done.
[1145.82 --> 1146.36]  I know.
[1146.48 --> 1146.78]  I know.
[1146.90 --> 1148.90]  I saw all the comments on the couple's PC
[1148.90 --> 1150.76]  where people were like, oh, Wendell did it.
[1151.42 --> 1154.22]  The fact that Wendell did it does not mean
[1154.22 --> 1155.52]  that it is user friendly.
[1156.04 --> 1156.16]  Okay.
[1156.26 --> 1157.84]  Wendell can do amazing things.
[1157.94 --> 1159.54]  Wendell could do just about anything.
[1160.10 --> 1161.54]  Yeah, as far as I can tell.
[1161.54 --> 1166.24]  Wendell, as far as I can tell, single-handedly created
[1166.24 --> 1168.44]  the DisplayPort KVM market.
[1168.92 --> 1170.58]  Did you know he collects?
[1171.90 --> 1174.72]  And I don't think this was a joke.
[1174.84 --> 1176.00]  I think this was serious.
[1177.28 --> 1182.64]  He collects the tops of like toilet bucket things.
[1182.64 --> 1185.32]  Like my dad's going to kill me.
[1185.40 --> 1185.86]  Like the shelf?
[1185.86 --> 1186.02]  Like the reservoir?
[1186.42 --> 1186.68]  Yeah.
[1187.38 --> 1187.82]  Yeah.
[1187.82 --> 1190.82]  Like the shelf to put your sandwich and your milk on, right?
[1191.46 --> 1192.60]  Your sandwich and your milk?
[1192.64 --> 1192.76]  Yeah.
[1192.76 --> 1193.82]  When you're snacking on the can.
[1195.18 --> 1195.52]  Yeah.
[1195.80 --> 1196.12]  Sure.
[1196.60 --> 1196.90]  Yeah.
[1197.70 --> 1198.10]  Yeah.
[1198.36 --> 1199.26]  He collects those.
[1199.42 --> 1200.16]  He collects them.
[1200.94 --> 1201.20]  Yeah.
[1201.78 --> 1202.82]  Where does he keep them?
[1203.70 --> 1203.90]  Yeah.
[1203.90 --> 1205.22]  Let me try to find this really quick.
[1205.26 --> 1206.46]  That's the weirdest thing.
[1206.54 --> 1210.04]  I love Wendell, but like, dude, what the f***?
[1210.44 --> 1211.08]  Like, what are you?
[1211.58 --> 1211.98]  What?
[1213.02 --> 1214.24]  Let me try to find it.
[1214.46 --> 1216.74]  I mean, are they like vintage or like?
[1218.76 --> 1219.98]  What are we talking about here?
[1220.04 --> 1225.12]  He like had some actually kind of cool ones, which was really interesting.
[1225.52 --> 1226.58]  Let me see if I can find it.
[1226.58 --> 1228.40]  When I first saw it, I was like, oh, that's a joke.
[1228.46 --> 1230.52]  And then I clicked on the thread and I was like, oh, wow.
[1230.68 --> 1231.40]  Some of these are actually.
[1231.54 --> 1231.70]  Okay.
[1231.78 --> 1232.36]  I found it.
[1232.88 --> 1233.20]  Okay.
[1233.20 --> 1237.14]  If you discord it to me, I can bring it up and screen share it.
[1237.30 --> 1238.48]  This is some like weird.
[1238.68 --> 1239.00]  Like what am I?
[1239.00 --> 1241.82]  By the way, Level One Text is on Flowplane and they're killing it.
[1241.88 --> 1242.46]  They're awesome there.
[1242.54 --> 1243.10]  Go check them out.
[1243.20 --> 1243.38]  Yeah.
[1243.54 --> 1243.72]  Go subscribe.
[1243.84 --> 1244.22]  Hooray, hooray.
[1245.16 --> 1245.48]  Wow.
[1246.12 --> 1246.48]  Okay.
[1247.10 --> 1249.12]  This is apparently real.
[1250.00 --> 1250.32]  Okay.
[1250.98 --> 1253.02]  The time has come for me to let go of a few things.
[1253.10 --> 1254.76]  The basement has got too much crap in it.
[1254.76 --> 1256.02]  Is that an intentional pun?
[1256.40 --> 1260.30]  But where does one go to unload their lovingly curated toilet lid collection?
[1260.30 --> 1263.30]  Is the internet ready to know about this?
[1263.44 --> 1265.26]  Are you like what?
[1265.86 --> 1272.96]  And like, that's way too many to just be random, you know?
[1273.60 --> 1276.88]  Like, Sep what?
[1277.54 --> 1278.48]  Sep 28.
[1278.64 --> 1279.44]  1974.
[1280.10 --> 1280.38]  Okay.
[1280.88 --> 1286.32]  That's like, that's like old enough to be old, but like not old enough to be vintage.
[1287.14 --> 1287.68]  Isn't it?
[1287.68 --> 1289.96]  I mean, how long ago was 1974, I guess?
[1290.90 --> 1292.74]  He's got, he's got ones from the fifties.
[1293.50 --> 1293.88]  Uh-huh.
[1294.00 --> 1297.04]  I've got one that was minted July 21st, 1969.
[1297.38 --> 1298.98]  So is this like, is it about the dates?
[1300.78 --> 1302.00]  There's a market for these.
[1302.06 --> 1302.94]  He says eBay.
[1304.12 --> 1305.84]  Toilet tank lid store.com.
[1305.90 --> 1306.96]  You've got to be $69.
[1307.24 --> 1308.72]  No, this is clearly a joke.
[1309.26 --> 1311.06]  The fact that it's priced at $69.
[1311.50 --> 1312.64]  I refuse to accept it.
[1312.70 --> 1314.36]  I refuse to accept that this is real.
[1315.00 --> 1315.96]  No, no.
[1315.96 --> 1324.98]  If Wendell, if Wendell wants to call me right now and, and explain himself, then maybe I will believe it because I trust, I trust Wendell.
[1325.38 --> 1326.12]  I do too.
[1326.20 --> 1329.92]  Which is why, like when he tweets this, I have to take it at face value.
[1330.14 --> 1330.76]  No, no.
[1330.76 --> 1332.54]  He's also, he's also a memer though.
[1332.54 --> 1336.00]  That's the problem with Wendell is he's a straight faced memer.
[1336.52 --> 1338.22]  So you can't trust him.
[1339.06 --> 1340.38]  But I also trust him.
[1340.54 --> 1340.64]  Yeah.
[1340.74 --> 1341.40]  I trust him too.
[1341.54 --> 1342.16]  I trust him too.
[1342.80 --> 1346.22]  We're talking about Wendell from level one texts and his toilet lid collection.
[1347.04 --> 1348.16]  It's weird.
[1348.16 --> 1353.84]  I mean, whatever you want to, yeah.
[1353.94 --> 1355.76]  Whatever you want to do, whatever gets you going.
[1356.02 --> 1356.26]  Yeah.
[1357.12 --> 1368.56]  So in other news, AMD provided a sneak peek at their Radeon RX 6000 series, now codenamed Big Navi, with numbers that seemingly put it in line with the RTX 3080.
[1368.56 --> 1373.06]  And if that's true, AMD might be competitive on all fronts this coming generation.
[1373.26 --> 1377.72]  Tell me something, Luke, would you build an all red gaming machine?
[1381.44 --> 1383.74]  Uh-oh, that's a long hesitation.
[1384.72 --> 1385.24]  Sure.
[1385.44 --> 1386.48]  Do you bleed green?
[1386.66 --> 1387.70]  Do you bleed green, Luke?
[1388.56 --> 1392.76]  I have been very hard on NVIDIA in the past.
[1393.06 --> 1397.78]  I have made a number of videos when I used to make videos that were very hard on NVIDIA in the past.
[1397.78 --> 1402.24]  But it was easy because the red team basically didn't exist at that point in time.
[1403.74 --> 1407.20]  So if they like exist properly, absolutely.
[1407.88 --> 1408.06]  Yeah.
[1408.68 --> 1410.88]  On the processor side, I think there's no question.
[1411.24 --> 1411.36]  Yeah.
[1411.84 --> 1414.08]  So, but there's a chance you'd go brown?
[1416.38 --> 1416.90]  Yes.
[1417.22 --> 1417.42]  Yeah.
[1417.52 --> 1417.78]  Okay.
[1418.20 --> 1418.44]  Yeah.
[1419.06 --> 1419.92]  Go brown.
[1420.58 --> 1421.48]  Green and red.
[1422.72 --> 1423.60]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1423.62 --> 1424.46]  The brown PC.
[1424.58 --> 1425.90]  We should totally make that a video.
[1425.90 --> 1428.34]  The brown PC go all Noctua and everything.
[1429.60 --> 1430.70]  That'd be kind of cool.
[1430.82 --> 1430.92]  Yeah.
[1431.00 --> 1432.64]  Well, I mean, remember the chocolate computer?
[1433.40 --> 1433.58]  Yeah.
[1433.98 --> 1435.24]  That color scheme was sick.
[1435.24 --> 1436.88]  That graphics card was sweet.
[1437.26 --> 1437.86]  It was sick.
[1437.98 --> 1439.52]  It actually looked so cool.
[1439.74 --> 1441.04]  Worked out so well.
[1442.74 --> 1443.10]  All right.
[1443.34 --> 1446.24]  So team PGP is streaming.
[1446.82 --> 1448.40]  And that's like Wendell and the gang.
[1448.40 --> 1453.50]  And people have gone over there and are talking to him about their toilet covers.
[1454.84 --> 1456.30]  Oh, is he live right now?
[1456.78 --> 1458.18]  Yeah, he's live right now.
[1458.72 --> 1459.46]  Oh, man.
[1459.64 --> 1460.10]  All right.
[1460.24 --> 1460.58]  Okay.
[1460.62 --> 1461.76]  Well, I was hoping he would.
[1461.98 --> 1462.76]  Wait, I don't see him.
[1462.78 --> 1463.56]  Oh, is he live on Twitch?
[1464.50 --> 1464.86]  Yes.
[1465.02 --> 1465.64]  Oh, okay.
[1465.64 --> 1467.22]  I just assumed he'd be live on YouTube.
[1467.34 --> 1470.38]  Maybe we'll like rate him afterward and razz him about his toilet collection.
[1471.04 --> 1471.32]  All right.
[1471.78 --> 1478.72]  Why don't we move on to the Drive Savers versus iPad Rehab Information War is apparently what
[1478.72 --> 1479.48]  this was called.
[1479.56 --> 1480.42]  It must have been James.
[1480.42 --> 1483.38]  If they're still going, we should play Left 4 Dead with them afterwards.
[1483.58 --> 1484.06]  Heck yeah.
[1484.36 --> 1485.00]  I'm super down.
[1485.00 --> 1487.46]  So Lewis Rossman made a video.
[1488.26 --> 1492.20]  Jessa from, shoot, what's her thing called again?
[1492.98 --> 1493.98]  iPad Rehab.
[1494.40 --> 1502.40]  Jessa from iPad Rehab made a video about saving iPhones that were stuck on the Apple logo after
[1502.40 --> 1503.82]  the iOS 13 update.
[1505.06 --> 1512.36]  And basically, I think the video I have linked here is Lewis's video talking about how our
[1512.36 --> 1518.82]  video, which was sponsored by Drive Savers, had Drive Savers apparently taking credit for
[1518.82 --> 1525.34]  this fix, which involved like shorting some speaker IC or something like that, and then
[1525.34 --> 1530.18]  booting it, and then pulling the data off, then resetting it, then unshorting it, and
[1530.18 --> 1532.44]  then the phone would just like work normally.
[1533.14 --> 1534.46]  So we have been accused.
[1534.68 --> 1534.88]  Kind of wild.
[1535.00 --> 1535.20]  Whoops.
[1535.52 --> 1536.36]  Oh my.
[1536.36 --> 1542.44]  So we have been accused of amplifying alleged misinformation from Drive Savers related to
[1542.44 --> 1545.80]  who exactly it is that discovered the fix.
[1546.58 --> 1552.24]  And Drive Savers, so, okay, so this appears to be like copied from one of the forum threads
[1552.24 --> 1556.26]  or one of the YouTube comments or something, but the allegation is that Drive Savers paid
[1556.26 --> 1561.70]  Linus to say that they had discovered the fix, and this is a fact that is contested.
[1561.70 --> 1568.74]  So on December 19th, 2019, Jessa from iPad Rehab streams her solution, removing deactivating
[1568.74 --> 1569.64]  speaker amp chip.
[1569.88 --> 1573.38]  She does mention in the video that she's been talking to several larger companies about this
[1573.38 --> 1573.72]  problem.
[1574.26 --> 1577.34]  She claims she learned of the fix a few days prior to the stream.
[1578.14 --> 1581.80]  The place to look for a hardware solution, this is a quote, the place to look for a hardware
[1581.80 --> 1587.22]  solution to a software problem is not our ideas, definitely not unintelligible RO our own.
[1587.60 --> 1591.36]  The credit goes to the collaborative culture of the hardworking men and women in the global
[1591.36 --> 1594.90]  independent repair micro soldering community and a few really tenacious board repair guys
[1594.90 --> 1600.32]  who are willing to freely share their hard-earned information, and she credits Raj Paul in Australia
[1600.32 --> 1600.88]  for one.
[1601.32 --> 1606.50]  And this is actually something that has been my experience in the data recovery and device
[1606.50 --> 1607.44]  repair industry.
[1607.68 --> 1609.86]  It's incredibly tight-knit.
[1610.10 --> 1611.94]  Like, yes, everyone's competing.
[1612.28 --> 1616.30]  There's only so many devices that are broken and need to be fixed, I guess.
[1616.80 --> 1620.90]  With that said, I mean, I think that the industry could be probably five times the size,
[1620.90 --> 1624.98]  and it would be better for the world if people were getting their devices repaired instead
[1624.98 --> 1630.06]  of just giving them back to Apple so that they can be recycled or which, by the way, it
[1630.06 --> 1633.38]  is not like that's recycling sounds really good.
[1634.00 --> 1635.00]  It's not that good.
[1635.12 --> 1637.20]  It's a lot better for the device to just keep working.
[1637.20 --> 1638.20]  Yes.
[1638.38 --> 1641.84]  And this was absolutely my experience with DeepSpar, for example.
[1641.98 --> 1643.96]  We've worked with them on sponsored videos in the past.
[1644.04 --> 1645.44]  Those guys are so cool.
[1646.22 --> 1655.86]  Like, they're like basically exactly the kind of like Russian data guys that you would expect.
[1656.72 --> 1659.50]  Like, one of the guys there, like literally is...
[1659.50 --> 1661.08]  I don't know if I'm allowed to say this.
[1661.48 --> 1661.76]  Whatever.
[1661.88 --> 1662.44]  I'm going for it.
[1662.44 --> 1663.86]  He's literally in a fight club.
[1664.34 --> 1665.84]  And I was like, what?
[1667.24 --> 1669.60]  Because he's like covered in scars and stuff.
[1669.64 --> 1672.48]  And I'm like, so what's up with that?
[1672.90 --> 1676.18]  And like, he's like kind of like, he's low-key jacked.
[1676.34 --> 1677.02]  You know what I mean?
[1677.34 --> 1683.40]  Like, not like, oh yeah, this is all for show and like I pose and stuff.
[1683.52 --> 1688.96]  But like, could definitely knock your head off if he hit you hard enough.
[1688.96 --> 1691.46]  And so I was like, yeah, I mean, we're chill, right?
[1691.74 --> 1693.86]  What's up with all the like scars and stuff?
[1694.16 --> 1695.90]  And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, I like fight.
[1696.16 --> 1697.68]  And I'm like, oh yeah, I like boxing.
[1697.78 --> 1698.56]  He's like, nah.
[1699.50 --> 1702.66]  I'm like, he's like, yeah, yeah, you just like you go and you like fight.
[1702.72 --> 1704.88]  And I'm like, is this fight club?
[1705.02 --> 1706.26]  And he's like, yeah, basically.
[1706.44 --> 1706.90]  I'm like, what?
[1706.90 --> 1714.42]  Anyway, so the DeepSpar guys are like some of the coolest techies I've ever met.
[1714.72 --> 1719.60]  And they're like, are exactly how you would imagine the kinds of people whose job it is,
[1719.60 --> 1726.12]  is to break the protections or even sometimes just lack of documentation and information
[1726.12 --> 1729.62]  from drive manufacturers in order to help people get their data back.
[1729.62 --> 1738.04]  And from talking to them, everything that I know about this community is just super collaborative
[1738.04 --> 1746.20]  because the cold hard truth is that between the unwillingness or inability of drive manufacturers
[1746.20 --> 1752.20]  to provide spare parts and information on repairing and recovering these devices,
[1752.54 --> 1756.08]  it takes a community in order to make this happen.
[1756.08 --> 1763.76]  So it seems like Jess's message overall here sounds about right to me that this is a collaborative thing.
[1764.78 --> 1770.50]  So she claims she called DriveSavers and OnTrack to let them know about the fix for the benefit of consumers
[1770.50 --> 1773.18]  since these companies are recommended by Apple.
[1773.78 --> 1781.30]  On October 1st, 2020, Linus amplifies this message from DriveSavers that said that they found the fix.
[1781.80 --> 1785.32]  And then on October 8th, Louis Rossman uploaded a video shining light
[1785.32 --> 1789.60]  on sort of this disagreement between DriveSavers and Jessa.
[1790.04 --> 1793.52]  So in response to us asking DriveSavers about it, they say,
[1794.06 --> 1794.28]  quote,
[1794.40 --> 1798.60]  We do not share solutions and timeframes when we make advancements in data recovery.
[1799.00 --> 1802.78]  So for her to refute our claims has no basis.
[1803.56 --> 1804.12]  Fair enough.
[1804.90 --> 1808.16]  DriveSavers claims they already had the fix prior to speaking to Jessa,
[1808.32 --> 1811.92]  and they support this using a screenshot taken two days before her stream.
[1811.92 --> 1813.68]  Paraphrasing.
[1813.82 --> 1814.46]  I'm paraphrasing here.
[1814.52 --> 1817.28]  They say basically, hey, this problem can be solved just so you know.
[1817.32 --> 1818.14]  And she says, yep, I know.
[1818.20 --> 1818.50]  Thanks.
[1820.38 --> 1825.90]  So at this point, I have not spoken to Jessa.
[1826.12 --> 1827.40]  I haven't spoken to Louis.
[1828.04 --> 1831.46]  All I've been able to do is go through what they're saying,
[1832.04 --> 1833.96]  ask DriveSavers for their take on it.
[1833.96 --> 1838.52]  They were, I want to thank them for even talking about this at all.
[1838.76 --> 1842.62]  They were a little reluctant to kind of get into this kind of thing.
[1842.70 --> 1848.56]  They were like, yeah, look, we don't really engage in this kind of like he said, she said.
[1849.16 --> 1852.14]  We've been doing this a very, very, very long time.
[1852.14 --> 1858.14]  And if, you know, at the end of the day, we feel like our reputation stands for itself.
[1858.24 --> 1868.30]  So we don't like to get into this kind of like, you know, who found it first sort of hearsay.
[1869.28 --> 1870.52]  And I get that.
[1870.66 --> 1871.94]  I totally understand that.
[1872.00 --> 1880.22]  I mean, we've gone through similar things in the past where we've been accused of things by much, much smaller YouTubers, for example, that weren't true.
[1880.22 --> 1886.22]  And unless they really like blew up in the community, our approach has always been to just ignore them.
[1886.44 --> 1892.32]  Because the reality of it is when we are, when we have 10 times, it's driving me crazy.
[1892.52 --> 1898.44]  When we have 10 times as many subscribers as someone else, our mere acknowledgement of their presence,
[1899.08 --> 1903.86]  even if we're calling them a liar, is a net positive gain in exposure for them.
[1903.96 --> 1909.80]  And so my general philosophy, anytime someone has wronged me, has been ignore them to death.
[1910.84 --> 1913.68]  Now, Drive Savers didn't say any of that.
[1914.00 --> 1916.92]  That's all just my approach to these kinds of disagreements.
[1917.06 --> 1921.16]  But I do know that they had a reluctance to get in here and talk about this at all.
[1921.28 --> 1923.56]  But I want to thank them for sharing their side of the story.
[1923.96 --> 1929.88]  I'm not in a position to verify because Drive Savers doesn't talk about this stuff publicly.
[1929.94 --> 1933.24]  I'm not in a position to verify who exactly came up with the fix.
[1933.24 --> 1938.46]  But I do want to say, you know, hey, I'm glad that the solution was found.
[1938.90 --> 1940.96]  I'm glad that people were able to get their data back.
[1941.18 --> 1945.04]  I really admire the collaborative nature of the data recovery community.
[1945.62 --> 1948.78]  And at the end of the day, I don't think Jess is the bad guy here.
[1948.92 --> 1950.64]  I don't think Louis is the bad guy.
[1950.78 --> 1952.76]  I don't think Drive Savers is the bad guy.
[1952.84 --> 1956.06]  I haven't seen any evidence that any of them are a bad guy here.
[1956.06 --> 1960.50]  I think at the end of the day, all of them from my interactions with Louis,
[1960.78 --> 1962.36]  from my interactions with Drive Savers.
[1962.60 --> 1963.78]  And like I said, I don't know Jess.
[1963.78 --> 1964.86]  I've never spoken to her.
[1965.20 --> 1968.92]  But everything that I know about her reputation tells me that these are all people
[1968.92 --> 1973.84]  that really do just want individuals and businesses to get their valuable data back.
[1973.98 --> 1978.40]  So I just don't want any more drama around this.
[1979.40 --> 1980.64]  I have not seen...
[1980.64 --> 1982.56]  Drive Savers has not led me wrong in the past.
[1982.96 --> 1984.70]  So I tend to trust them.
[1984.70 --> 1987.82]  But maybe there was just a misunderstanding here.
[1987.90 --> 1991.70]  I mean, this could be as simple as the whole calculus invention thing.
[1992.10 --> 1995.58]  I mean, calculus is sort of famous for being invented by two people.
[1995.74 --> 1997.38]  Or you could call it a discovery.
[1997.58 --> 1998.88]  I mean, math is its inherent.
[1999.08 --> 1999.88]  So you kind of discover it.
[1999.88 --> 2001.90]  There's a few things like that too.
[2002.22 --> 2002.82]  It's not just...
[2002.82 --> 2004.18]  The calculus one is very interesting.
[2004.40 --> 2008.94]  But there's quite a few things where like in completely different parts of the world
[2008.94 --> 2011.56]  and without like internet style communication,
[2011.88 --> 2013.48]  things were discovered simultaneously.
[2013.48 --> 2016.16]  It's a thing.
[2016.26 --> 2016.76]  It happens.
[2018.76 --> 2023.20]  I don't know if this is true because I can't hear.
[2024.32 --> 2027.84]  But as far as I can tell from looking at the Team PGP chat,
[2027.92 --> 2031.06]  I think you need to check your Twitter because he's wondering what your phone number is.
[2031.16 --> 2031.56]  I think.
[2031.56 --> 2033.00]  Wendell doesn't have my phone number?
[2033.48 --> 2033.92]  Since what?
[2034.28 --> 2034.80]  I don't...
[2034.80 --> 2035.56]  I'm not sure.
[2035.74 --> 2036.30]  I don't know.
[2036.64 --> 2036.96]  Maybe.
[2038.52 --> 2040.34]  Someone said he needs to...
[2040.34 --> 2042.58]  Linus just has to check Twitter for a phone number.
[2042.90 --> 2043.56]  Someone said that.
[2044.20 --> 2046.80]  So I don't know if that's like legit or not.
[2046.96 --> 2047.22]  Okay.
[2047.28 --> 2047.86]  One moment, please.
[2047.86 --> 2050.12]  I can't hear what Wendell's saying.
[2050.46 --> 2051.22]  One moment, please.

[2149.76 --> 2154.96]  breaker if nothing else what about the meter on the side of your house there should be a great
[2154.96 --> 2159.04]  big disconnect we can throw that okay you keep changing the subject you keep changing the subject
[2159.04 --> 2164.88]  because i want to talk to you about this toilet seat collection or not seat toilet cover toilet cover
[2164.88 --> 2171.12]  collection yeah there's over a hundred yeah i understand that i can tell that from the picture
[2171.12 --> 2176.08]  that's not really the question the question is not how many you have the question is why
[2178.08 --> 2182.56]  so it turns out that's the thing that plumbers do i i kind of sort of inherited the collection
[2182.56 --> 2190.24]  in a manner of speaking and uh this this was your dad a plumber comes from well no no not exactly okay
[2190.24 --> 2197.44]  uh uh it just sort of uh it just sort of worked out that way so yeah there's a there's quite a
[2197.44 --> 2204.40]  collection of toilet lids from like 1909 all the way up through like 1997. so like 90 years of toilet
[2204.40 --> 2210.00]  lids it's really just completely insane okay can i just for just as a point of clarification here um
[2210.00 --> 2215.84]  what is the point of this like do you try to do you try to get like really cool manufacturing dates
[2215.84 --> 2222.56]  like this toilet lid was made on the day that you know uh linus tech tips uh you tried linux for the
[2222.56 --> 2229.36]  first time like what what's the significance yeah there are a couple of those in there like that which
[2229.36 --> 2236.32]  is completely insane but is that by chance yeah that's just completely by chance um it's just it's
[2236.32 --> 2242.08]  just a fun thing you notice when you're cataloging them so even more insane there are websites dedicated
[2242.08 --> 2248.88]  to uh tank lid like somebody like chips their lid and it's like oh man i need something that matches
[2248.88 --> 2255.04]  my vintage 1979 you know uh olive green toilet where am i going to get a replacement lid there's
[2255.04 --> 2260.40]  three or four websites that are like hey replacement toiletlid.com and they have a far more impressive
[2260.40 --> 2265.84]  collection than i do this is one of those things like mattress underground where i like i look at it and i go
[2265.84 --> 2271.04]  wow who like who dedicates their life to you know making sure that people understand the difference
[2271.04 --> 2278.64]  between you know like uh like organic latex and like regular latex and what mattresses are made of
[2278.64 --> 2286.88]  and whatever like really yeah yeah it's it's one of those rabbit holes that it's like okay someone has
[2286.88 --> 2292.00]  put a lot of time into curating this collection because where else are you going to find you know like
[2292.00 --> 2297.36]  the olive green like the olive drab you know toilet tank lid or like that certain shade of blue from
[2297.36 --> 2303.12]  like 1978 but if you have a toilet like that and you chip the lid and you're not going to replace the
[2303.12 --> 2308.24]  entire toilet where else you're going to go yeah i mean this is just the kind of problem that i never um
[2308.24 --> 2313.28]  that yeah i just never imagined myself having therefore i never imagined what the solution would need to be
[2313.28 --> 2322.24]  so um i know for a fact that you're a businessman and you also run a youtube channel and i'm sort of
[2322.24 --> 2328.80]  wondering if it's the best use of your time to catalog toilet lids can you could you respond to that
[2330.00 --> 2335.52]  it's a it's a little there's a there's a therapeutic component to it maybe so you know okay i don't know
[2335.52 --> 2342.96]  uh it's a it's a certain there's a certain quiet dignity to i can't even say it with a straight
[2342.96 --> 2349.44]  face there's a quiet dignity to uh you know it's like oh wow this is this certain brand that's from
[2349.44 --> 2353.52]  italy and you know nobody's ever heard of them before and but most of them are you know american
[2353.52 --> 2360.72]  standard or not really anything too exotic okay um well thank you for that that was wonderful that was
[2360.72 --> 2366.64]  just one heck of a story uh thanks wendell uh how late you guys game in tonight uh probably another
[2366.64 --> 2370.88]  hour or two i'll take some more pictures and post them on twitter afterward bummer okay i'll probably
[2370.88 --> 2374.56]  i'll probably miss you then we were gonna play some left for dead 2 later but i know you guys are
[2374.56 --> 2380.00]  like over eastern you're eastern time right yeah yeah yeah okay all right that's well past my bedtime
[2380.00 --> 2383.68]  all right i'll catch you i'll catch you another time i'll catch you another time thanks wendell
[2384.48 --> 2389.76]  sounds good thank you take care all right so guys make sure that you uh go check out um
[2389.76 --> 2395.68]  wendell on twitter so that's uh what is it is it at level one text i think so uh
[2398.24 --> 2408.56]  tech wendell t-e-k wendell oh okay it's also at uh level one text but okay i suspect i suspect the
[2408.56 --> 2415.84]  toilet seats are going to be on the personal account all right um but yeah all right sounds good uh okay
[2415.84 --> 2421.36]  cool well now we know i don't know that that knowledge enriches my life particularly but uh
[2421.36 --> 2428.24]  thank thank you for that wendell enriched mine did it okay good you know what enriches me this message
[2428.24 --> 2438.56]  from our sponsor uh ridge wallet wait all right oh wait are these not right uh oh um uh
[2438.56 --> 2445.44]  uh wrong whoever put the sponsors in the thing um kind of derped it i think because i have two
[2445.44 --> 2451.12]  different sets i have one set of the like lower of the lower thirds like the copy and then i have
[2451.12 --> 2458.16]  another set of talking points um we can fix this hold on uh no no i just don't know which set is right
[2458.80 --> 2464.16]  oh okay and i have no way of knowing we might have to do another top emergency topic emergency topic
[2464.16 --> 2471.12]  uh okay that's such a good segue though now oh what a waste is entering beta the like a public
[2471.12 --> 2476.32]  beta soon tuesday 60 starlink satellites were launched and when they're in position the public
[2476.32 --> 2481.52]  beta will start uh elon musk is unsure when the satellites will reach their target position but it
[2481.52 --> 2488.88]  will probably be within a couple months the satellites will reach their target altitude in about 45 days
[2488.88 --> 2496.24]  which is done in batches of 20 so it'll be about 135 days total uh this puts the satellites in position
[2496.24 --> 2505.36]  around february 18th 2021 it's a little bit more than a couple months um must said the public beta will
[2505.36 --> 2513.04]  be available fall of 2020 okay so maybe that this is all over the place uh with with only certain areas
[2513.04 --> 2518.16]  getting coverage a limited beta okay so when like one batch goes up they're starting public yet
[2518.88 --> 2524.08]  a limited beta has been currently already running in rural areas of washington state there's been some
[2524.08 --> 2528.88]  really cool news about that actually uh if you want to look into it there's some some people that have
[2528.88 --> 2532.88]  always had issues getting internet connections that now have like decently high speed internet it's
[2532.88 --> 2538.24]  really actually pretty sweet um and apparently this has been oh yeah this has been useful for oh i didn't
[2538.24 --> 2543.04]  know this part it's been useful for first responders in rural areas of washington during the wildfires
[2543.04 --> 2550.96]  uh in the wildfires uh the last year uh the last year was that isps were price gouging first responders
[2550.96 --> 2555.04]  because they were using too much data and they were charging them tons and tons of money i remember
[2555.04 --> 2561.20]  talking about that online show so this is a little bit better news than that um so yeah that's exciting
[2561.20 --> 2568.08]  i'm definitely gonna try this out just because it's me too for sure it's just such an interesting
[2569.60 --> 2577.60]  transition for for technology you know like this is this is just wild i don't know i i will try it out in
[2577.60 --> 2582.80]  the public beta probably not use it again for at least a very extreme amount of time but super
[2582.80 --> 2589.68]  interesting idea it'll make like i remember on a couple trips that i've done like okay maybe you get
[2589.68 --> 2594.88]  a local sim something like that something that i started doing more recently was was you get the like
[2596.48 --> 2603.20]  like google's isp thing and you can do it through esim oh okay and you can just subscribe for like a
[2603.20 --> 2608.08]  little bit a little bit of time but all you really need is some data so if you can start using starlink
[2608.08 --> 2617.12]  in those situations could be could be kind of cool the gmc hummer infotainment system will be powered by
[2617.76 --> 2625.20]  by unreal engine um what does this mean uh basically you get a pretty cool looking graphic on your car
[2625.20 --> 2632.00]  screen and that might be basically it but it could mean more in the future maybe could mean better
[2632.00 --> 2637.36]  running better looking infotainment systems which um especially for ones that come directly from
[2638.00 --> 2643.84]  the car manufacturer and aren't like basically done by apple or whatever else that's very needed in my
[2643.84 --> 2653.84]  opinion yeah absolutely it's so bad i i would be i would be so thrilled to just see like i mean everything
[2653.84 --> 2661.68]  from it being more responsive to yeah just having a like a a like a a cooler looking interface like
[2661.68 --> 2668.40]  everything about that could absolutely be better literally potential uh better like touch detection
[2668.40 --> 2673.44]  like there's there's a lot of things they could do with this um so while right now it might just mean
[2673.44 --> 2680.96]  a prettier graphic moving forward it it might mean a lot more than just cool all right uh sponsors for
[2680.96 --> 2686.08]  the show today ridge wallet stop carrying pointless items around in your pockets like receipts old hotel
[2686.08 --> 2690.24]  room keys or spent gift cards with the ridge wallet you'll carry less because it doesn't hold that much

[2824.48 --> 2831.20]  transitions so the thing doesn't move when we press the thing all right let's get into our second
[2831.20 --> 2841.36]  dramatic topic of the week msi was accused of scalping their own rtx 3080 inventory they well
[2841.36 --> 2846.96]  actually let's let's go through this in chronological order yeah i have an interesting
[2846.96 --> 2853.12]  question for you on this one but hit me start with that we should maybe go through the okay
[2854.48 --> 2860.00]  you didn't all msi pc and the sponsorship just so i'm assuming it was a sponsorship
[2860.00 --> 2863.28]  just so happened to be right now is that legit yes
[2863.28 --> 2871.20]  it's like how does that feel it's like they're trying to make me look bad
[2874.72 --> 2883.92]  okay can i ask when was that agreed to oh man months ago like yeah okay maybe not months but
[2883.92 --> 2891.04]  definitely weeks multiple weeks like we've had the parts on hand yes we've had the parts on hand for a
[2891.04 --> 2899.60]  while like unbelievable so i saw i saw that tweet go out and i was like okay i know this for a fact
[2899.60 --> 2905.52]  was not like a knee-jerk thing there's no way this was planned out like a day or two ago this must have
[2905.52 --> 2914.00]  been way in the past but now they're stuck with this project so oh man the good news is that i was right
[2914.00 --> 2921.68]  about the msi scandal so what happened was it broke on reddit that uh i think it's called like msi
[2922.24 --> 2926.00]  no no no no no what's it what's it called they didn't actually put any notes in here for me on
[2926.00 --> 2932.32]  this which is yeah just says talking point pretty pretty annoying so i think it's called like starlet
[2932.32 --> 2939.04]  starlet partner seller or something like that is is what it's called on ebay starlet partner and i
[2939.04 --> 2945.12]  don't know if you guys know this but msi stands for microstar international so um starlet partner
[2945.12 --> 2951.28]  has a long history of a long sales history they had like 1500 reviews with pretty with a pretty high
[2951.28 --> 2958.56]  rating and as far as anyone could tell they only sold msi products and so it looked as though these
[2958.56 --> 2966.24]  this was like kind of an msi um msi ebay store msi ebay store like sell direct to customers kind of ebay
[2966.24 --> 2970.32]  store and they're not the only ones that have done something like that but what people were upset
[2970.32 --> 2979.04]  about was that msi had rtx 3080s listed there for like double the msrp so around 1500 us dollars i mean
[2979.04 --> 2986.00]  that's the price of the rtx 3090 if msrp which i guess no one cares about anymore is anything to go by
[2986.00 --> 2992.08]  so people got mad because they were like hey you know the messaging from nvidia is like we're trying
[2992.08 --> 2996.96]  really hard to get these cards into the hands of gamers at the price that we said they were supposed
[2996.96 --> 3004.88]  to be and then you got partners like msi running around selling them for apparently 13.59 uh 13.59
[3004.88 --> 3009.68]  was what they had it listed for so that is a little less than double the price sorry excuse me i'm
[3009.68 --> 3016.08]  correct i'll correct myself here um so people were understandably outraged because you know here is
[3016.64 --> 3021.28]  everyone else in good faith trying to get these cards into the hands of real gamers instead of
[3021.28 --> 3029.76]  scalpers and here's msi profiteering off of this extremely allocated card all right so as this was
[3029.76 --> 3035.28]  blowing up i had a conversation with i don't know if i don't know if he wants me to talk about who it
[3035.28 --> 3041.76]  was but i had a conversation with a buddy of mine in the tech space and i was like look here's my here's
[3041.76 --> 3049.68]  my hypothesis here's my theory um i think this is probably just i think this is real so there was
[3049.68 --> 3056.40]  some initial uh doubt about whether starlit partner was even msi um so everyone was like digging into
[3056.40 --> 3061.28]  like trademark registrations and all kind of stuff and i was like ah this looks like msi to me it smells
[3061.28 --> 3068.40]  like msi it looks like msi it's probably msi and as it turns out it was msi and then from there uh there
[3068.40 --> 3073.84]  was oh great so as part of the process this uh this friend of mine called up starlit and was like
[3074.48 --> 3080.24]  this is weird because okay i could believe it's msi from like uh from like the kind of things they're
[3080.24 --> 3086.64]  selling and the their long history of existing and all that stuff um they're good rating for example
[3086.64 --> 3091.92]  but it was weird because i like called them and it was just went to like some guy's voicemail
[3091.92 --> 3099.28]  and i was like all right i'm once again going to lean on my experience working for a computer
[3099.92 --> 3104.80]  it's hard to it's hard to classify ncix because on the one hand they're like a small time like hole
[3104.80 --> 3110.16]  in the wall computer store but on the other hand they peaked at like 200 million dollars a year revenue
[3110.16 --> 3116.80]  and like 250 employees but they never really outgrew that attitude so i was like okay let me share
[3116.80 --> 3124.00]  a little anecdote with you from my time at ncix because here's my theory i think the ebay team
[3124.00 --> 3128.64]  pretty much just like somehow got their hands on some of these and we're like wow this would look
[3128.64 --> 3134.72]  really good on our pnl report for the month um so for those of you not familiar pnl is profit and loss
[3134.72 --> 3140.32]  and typically if you have a small team working on kind of a weirdo side project like that they would
[3140.32 --> 3145.28]  have some kind of kpis that they're supposed to hit like you know oh you need to move through
[3145.84 --> 3151.84]  x number of dollars in dead stock a month or you need to uh sell it you know x amount of profit
[3151.84 --> 3156.24]  which would incentivize them to put up more attractive looking listings with better pictures
[3156.24 --> 3162.48]  um so that they would stand out um so my take on it was the ebay team probably got their hands on these
[3162.48 --> 3168.80]  things somehow either by accident or through like conniving to get access to them decided to sell them
[3168.80 --> 3172.56]  probably thought they were doing the company a favor by making way more money on these things
[3172.56 --> 3181.76]  and uh and that's i probably not like i know the guy that runs msi usa and like he's a good guy like i
[3181.76 --> 3189.12]  don't i i don't think there's any way that he would have known anything about this um
[3189.12 --> 3195.68]  um the the like one one of the weird things that i saw was and it was actually posted by spartaman64
[3195.68 --> 3204.24]  yeah um a huge poster on the ltd forum but it's a it's an amazon link to the seller details of starlit
[3204.24 --> 3210.56]  partner yeah and their detailed seller information has their business name as msi computer corp
[3210.56 --> 3216.24]  yes and their business address as like city of industry blah blah blah yes but that could have
[3216.24 --> 3220.88]  potentially been faked at least over the short term absolutely the thing that made me pretty sure was
[3220.88 --> 3226.24]  that they'd existed for so long and had so many reviews with that address listed like clearly someone
[3226.24 --> 3231.60]  would have had to return something at some point and someone would have noticed that like um you know
[3231.60 --> 3236.16]  the address doesn't matter whatever is this graphics card coming from yeah so i figured it was as
[3236.16 --> 3242.80]  simple as the the ebay oh right so back to my anecdote um so ncix they they were a small hole
[3242.80 --> 3248.32]  in the wall computer shop but they were also like a national chain and i was like i'm gonna let you in
[3248.32 --> 3254.08]  on something our ebay store which was how we got rid of a lot of the open box and refurbished items or
[3254.08 --> 3260.16]  dead stock items that we just couldn't promote you know in a more conventional way had one guy running it
[3260.16 --> 3268.00]  tim and if you called the number you got tim's voicemail and my friend's like really and i'm like
[3268.00 --> 3276.08]  yeah like that doesn't surprise me at all like not one bit so on the one hand even companies that do
[3276.08 --> 3280.16]  like the the numbers that you push back then like a lot of times you're doing so many things that
[3280.72 --> 3285.36]  that sections especially small sections they're very likely ran by just one person with very little
[3285.36 --> 3290.08]  oversight and exactly that's the thing is like you could look at it and go no there's no way in the
[3290.08 --> 3298.72]  side i wouldn't know about this like okay ncix was a relatively small partner of msi back in the
[3298.72 --> 3305.36]  day and this relatively small partner i would be ordering anywhere from 300 to like 800 video cards a
[3305.36 --> 3312.72]  week msi is not noticing like four graphics cards being sold on the ebay store this is a rounding error
[3312.72 --> 3320.00]  for a business of that magnitude so it's like yeah we can go all conspiracy theory tinfoil hat like oh yeah
[3320.00 --> 3328.32]  they were profiteering get real that's not that that's not realistic anyone with the with the
[3328.32 --> 3335.84]  foresight uh to make actual business decisions wouldn't have time to deal with whatever the ebay guys are
[3335.84 --> 3342.40]  doing and also would know better than to get caught selling graphics cards for double the price
[3342.40 --> 3350.96]  so that that's that was my take on it um i actually have not kept up uh with what anyone else has said
[3350.96 --> 3356.24]  about it so i don't know i don't know if i don't know if whoever i was talking to i don't know if
[3356.24 --> 3361.20]  they've come out and said they were talking to me about it i don't know what ended up actually happening
[3361.20 --> 3367.60]  for sure but um yeah i just oh apparently i was okay no apparently i was mentioned by name so i was
[3367.60 --> 3372.24]  talking to steve about it apparently uh steve from gamers nexus did talk about our conversation so how
[3372.24 --> 3379.04]  did that turn out you guys have to let me know in the chat uh i i didn't actually watch it i was
[3379.04 --> 3385.04]  busy making my own videos i i it makes sense to me that like the dude that runs the ebay thing
[3385.04 --> 3387.84]  was like hey i can like make my numbers look better
[3389.92 --> 3394.24]  yeah i wouldn't wouldn't be surprised if that happened uh people are like msi admitted it yeah what
[3394.24 --> 3398.48]  do you mean msi admitted what that was never that was never a question for me starlit partner was
[3398.48 --> 3405.84]  definitely msi um so apparently uh the the net that did it does steve basically called customer
[3405.84 --> 3411.76]  support before he started contacting his taiwan contacts man steve goes hardcore steve goes hardcore
[3411.76 --> 3416.80]  i love steve it's like yeah i'm like i'm gonna learn chinese so that i can like
[3418.00 --> 3423.52]  talk to the real engineers and stuff like man uh yeah i love that guy i love that guy
[3424.08 --> 3429.60]  um so people aren't saying that uh how many they wouldn't want to risk something like that for such
[3429.60 --> 3434.88]  a small amount of money uh someone on twitter said something like linus did about how they're so big
[3434.88 --> 3438.48]  they wouldn't want to risk something like that for a small amount of money jay said go away the adults
[3438.48 --> 3444.88]  are talking now that's i i strongly disagree with jay's sentiment there everyone that i know at msi
[3444.88 --> 3452.40]  who actually is in a position of authority has way more common sense like you have no idea the kind of
[3452.40 --> 3458.00]  impact that it would be on msi's business for them to be doing something like that and get caught by
[3458.00 --> 3467.20]  a partner like nvidia nvidia holds so much power over their partners and has made it very very clear
[3468.00 --> 3472.88]  um apparently tech linked said it wasn't msi oh bloody hell you guys i i'm sorry i did not
[3472.88 --> 3477.52]  perfect example of not every single part of a company having perfect oversight from the ceo all
[3477.52 --> 3483.76]  the time yeah pretty much there are things that happen um oh man now i'm all distracted what was
[3483.76 --> 3494.16]  i saying again uh you're talking about uh jay oh nvidia nvidia's power so if nvidia were to discover
[3494.16 --> 3501.76]  that msi was profiteering off of rtx 3080s i can pretty much guarantee you i can guarantee you from
[3501.76 --> 3508.40]  my experience dealing with nvidia dealing with their partners like the amount of fear of nvidia that
[3508.40 --> 3514.72]  exists in the industry is it's palpable um nvidia's actions would go something along these lines uh
[3514.72 --> 3522.80]  their quarters mdf would be either cut or eliminated their allocation of future rtx 3080 would be either
[3522.80 --> 3532.16]  cut or eliminated for some period of time like nvidia has the means to make their partners bleed because
[3532.16 --> 3539.76]  rtx 3080 chips are effectively like money they're just money the more of them that nvidia can make
[3539.76 --> 3545.84]  right now the more money nvidia can print yeah because like i think i'm not the only one getting
[3545.84 --> 3550.56]  to this point but this is this if you can get the stuff and i mean some of it's not even out yet but
[3550.56 --> 3555.36]  it's coming soon this is a fantastic time to build a new computer the last generation of graphics cards was
[3556.64 --> 3561.68]  like i've been talking about that for a few shows now it was it was not very good for a lot of reasons
[3561.68 --> 3569.28]  and the last step of processors was like continually very impressive but still had some wins on the
[3569.28 --> 3575.60]  other side right now you have like a fantastic card at a great price and a fantastic processor at a
[3575.60 --> 3581.68]  great price that are like new shiny fancy options so i suspect a lot of people are trying to get stuff
[3581.68 --> 3588.08]  and like lanus just said if you can ship it it just it's immediate money every time fleoner says uh steve
[3588.08 --> 3592.40]  basically said that even though the high ups at msi didn't notice it was still unacceptable yep sounds
[3592.40 --> 3597.92]  about right yeah um but it's also the kind of thing that like in fairness to msi hasn't come up in a
[3597.92 --> 3603.68]  while when was the last time there was a gpu that was so allocated that weeks after launch nobody could
[3603.68 --> 3610.64]  get one still it's been years and years and years and i mean that's how that's how new policies get made
[3610.64 --> 3615.68]  is you have to kind of come up against an edge case where the existing policy didn't work and you have to
[3615.68 --> 3623.84]  do fix it so yeah nvidia carries a huge stick and there there there's no way that anyone who
[3624.80 --> 3630.24]  interacts with nvidia at all would have approved something like that but it's definitely a good
[3630.24 --> 3634.48]  call that they're putting policies in place to prevent it in the future because it's not acceptable
[3634.48 --> 3639.76]  like it's still profiteering even if they didn't know they were doing it yes yeah oh yeah no it's not
[3639.76 --> 3645.44]  a good thing i think we're just kind of explaining that like the leadership very likely didn't know
[3646.56 --> 3651.92]  yeah um but yeah should still be addressed someone in someone in float plane chat said like there should
[3651.92 --> 3657.68]  be refunds or the difference the difference between the like raised price and the stock price should be
[3657.68 --> 3663.76]  sent over like those are interesting ideas another thing that someone in float plane chat brought up if i can
[3663.76 --> 3671.12]  find it i just accidentally scrolled away from it olinic uh said talk about am5 do you think the 5950x
[3671.12 --> 3676.96]  is a dead-end cpu on am4 this is something i meant to actually talk about earlier in the show and forgot
[3676.96 --> 3685.12]  i'd be very surprised if it's not um although i okay so there's a few things here so one is we know that ddr5
[3685.12 --> 3692.80]  is in production i think it was micron did micron post a picture of a module the other day ddr5 exists
[3692.80 --> 3699.28]  now and ram doesn't really tend to exist until there's a platform that's going to support it
[3699.28 --> 3705.68]  that needs to be developed yeah um for them to put it in and then that timeline is you know anywhere from
[3706.40 --> 3713.44]  usually what 12 to 18 months something along those lines so that uh that falls really nicely in line
[3713.44 --> 3723.68]  with am5 which i think has amd confirmed um ddr5 on am5 blah blah blah amd zen 4 ryzen 5 blah blah
[3723.68 --> 3729.84]  am5 platform in 2022 usb 4 something something something this looks like a rumor this is this is a rumor
[3730.32 --> 3735.12]  um so it leaked out over at gamers nexus ignore the naming because they went and skipped 4 000 so i guess
[3735.12 --> 3741.28]  it would probably be 6 000 um i would be very very surprised
[3741.28 --> 3749.12]  to see an am5 cpu work on an x570 board but i also wouldn't be um
[3750.96 --> 3757.04]  i mean it wouldn't be impossible we have seen cpus in the past that have had memory controllers that can
[3757.04 --> 3761.68]  communicate with multiple standards if i recall correctly i mean i know there were definitely
[3761.68 --> 3765.84]  platforms that supported multiple ones but i'm actually i'm a little hazy on whether that was through
[3765.84 --> 3770.96]  the chipset or whether that was actually through an integrated memory controller you guys will have to
[3771.68 --> 3778.80]  help me out here integrated memory controller ddr2 ddr3 it would have been kind of back in those days
[3778.80 --> 3784.64]  i'm pretty sure we've seen mobile cpus that have support for both ddr2 and ddr3 or ddr3 ddr4
[3785.36 --> 3790.80]  just one thing i made a mistake yeah um they the emma and i want to address it because the i
[3790.80 --> 3794.96]  flow plane chat's freaking out and i'm sure all the other chats are freaking out too um so that that
[3794.96 --> 3800.48]  was not a like suggestion that is what they're doing um they they have fully i know you mentioned
[3800.48 --> 3805.20]  this but they fully clarified it was four graphics cards in total in the us only and they have said
[3805.20 --> 3810.40]  that individual customers who purchase these gpus uh they offered to they offered two options to the
[3810.40 --> 3815.60]  customers the customers can return the product and receive a full refund or a partial refund of the
[3815.60 --> 3822.24]  amount paid over msi's msrp and moving forward msi will enforce a striptor policy to avoid a situation
[3822.24 --> 3827.04]  like this happening again but yeah those were not suggestions those were that is specifically what
[3827.04 --> 3834.16]  msi is doing and i think that that sounds completely acceptable to me i i don't know some people are just
[3834.16 --> 3840.24]  honestly being kind of stupid about it um jorah saboeth uh says giving price difference between msrp and
[3840.24 --> 3846.40]  price charged or a refund is not a nice idea what what are you talking what else would you do like
[3847.28 --> 3853.84]  what are you talking about if i if i had the cash to throw around on a like very very priced up graphics
[3853.84 --> 3860.64]  card and someone else probably not even me figured out that it wasn't like that it was technically msi and
[3860.64 --> 3864.96]  they were like being weird annoying scalpers yeah and i just got a ton of money back i'd be super
[3864.96 --> 3870.16]  stoked i'd be like thanks if i was like personally offended by the fact that that whole situation
[3870.16 --> 3874.08]  even happened despite the fact that i bought a scalped graphics card so i don't really know how
[3874.08 --> 3879.92]  i have much to say in that situation but if i was i just return and get all my money back easy oh hold
[3879.92 --> 3886.56]  on i see what happened here this was the clone there's two u's in the name so he's insane that's
[3886.56 --> 3894.48]  why he's upset about this solution what oh i thought you would i thought this was some star wars lore that
[3894.48 --> 3901.04]  you would enjoy wait sorry where where is the the the username in uh on youtube is joris
[3901.04 --> 3905.76]  siboth or kiboth i don't know how to pronounce the last name okay nice yeah so let's see that so i was
[3905.76 --> 3909.60]  just i i the only reason i responded to the comment was because i wanted to set up that punchline
[3911.92 --> 3917.36]  sorry i've been reading flow plane chat not those youtube plebs apparently it's two r's not two u's
[3917.36 --> 3924.40]  dang dang maybe i got it wrong whatever i'm okay with it so yeah it's bad and uh okay it's
[3924.40 --> 3932.32]  over um playstation 5 teardown okay so there's a few takeaways here giant cooler that's pretty cool
[3932.80 --> 3939.04]  he got him so i i know that one of sony's one of sony's key design points for the console has been
[3939.04 --> 3944.88]  that they want it to be able to turbo hard um so that's that's pretty sick uh what else we got here
[3945.52 --> 3952.08]  um the uh the side panels being so easily removable and potentially replaceable i had i talked to
[3952.08 --> 3957.36]  david at work he's already like yeah i'm for sure going to get some of the third party side panels
[3957.36 --> 3961.76]  that will for sure exist for this thing i was going to do a dbrand skin on the stock ones but
[3961.76 --> 3965.92]  now i'm going to wait and see what becomes available as a third party option because
[3966.80 --> 3973.12]  that's pretty sick like as a way to customize a console that was clearly designed to look stand out
[3973.12 --> 3977.84]  right yeah i like it i like it i'm into it what what what were the standouts for you
[3977.84 --> 3986.00]  uh it's it's huge and like we already knew that but oh my goodness i know right like seeing a person
[3986.00 --> 3995.76]  for scale like and hands working on it it's like crazy and especially max like i put an xbox series
[3995.76 --> 4001.20]  x in my media console last week as part of like a preview video that's going to go up soon and i was
[4001.20 --> 4010.16]  like wow it like fits you know playstation 5 where is it going to fit like that's a problem how does
[4010.16 --> 4018.08]  this fit into my living room setup you know it's interesting i don't know and like watching the
[4018.08 --> 4023.28]  this two things from the teardown video the audio is like terrible and the dude is the least interested
[4023.28 --> 4030.80]  in this process you could like possibly be which was uh you know interesting but yeah my my main takeaway
[4030.80 --> 4040.08]  from it honestly like the cooler is awesome but the thing is just gigantic oh i i lied apparently
[4040.08 --> 4044.72]  that preview with the xbox series x is already up on floatplane so i don't know when it's coming up on
[4044.72 --> 4052.40]  youtube um yeah so anyway uh other key takeaways here uh the m.2 expansion slot was shown so it also
[4052.40 --> 4058.40]  has convenient holes for vacuuming out dust that are also located under the side panels really interesting
[4058.40 --> 4065.12]  that's great it's good to see someone like like apple set so many industry trends and like not
[4065.12 --> 4069.52]  giving any about the fact that dust is going to build up in the cooling of your system is one of
[4069.52 --> 4075.28]  the ones that i find most egregious like especially when they design their systems to run like right at
[4075.28 --> 4081.12]  the red line right out of the factory the fact that they don't include any dust filtration on the mac pro
[4081.12 --> 4086.64]  the the new mac pro was something that i was just looking at going man you guys addressed so many of the
[4086.64 --> 4094.00]  other problems couldn't you just put a dust filter in it like come on um so it's really nice to see a
[4094.00 --> 4103.52]  console finally address this uh vrms dedicated cooling uh massive cooler let's see instead of
[4103.52 --> 4111.12]  typical paste for thermal interface material this was so cool liquid metal yeah with the light with the
[4111.12 --> 4118.80]  like foam dam or whatever yeah yeah yeah so we've seen this done before to my knowledge asus was the
[4118.80 --> 4124.88]  first to ship a commercial product with it in their mothership laptop i think they were the first and it
[4124.88 --> 4130.16]  was not a simple process from what they told me because it's not liquid metal is not just a matter of
[4130.16 --> 4135.68]  like apply it once and forget about it it seeps like it's liquid at room temperature so it can like
[4135.68 --> 4140.64]  come out it can short things it can it can all come out so it's not even in there anymore and you
[4140.64 --> 4147.60]  don't get good thermal transfer so sony apparently tackled it in a pretty similar manner to asus um
[4149.04 --> 4153.84]  going for like uh like a kind of dam around it that'll keep the liquid metal in place hopefully i
[4153.84 --> 4157.28]  saw some people saying oh that's so stupid you're gonna have to replace it every i saw someone say
[4157.28 --> 4161.92]  that you're gonna have to replace every three to six months what are you like are you are you insane
[4161.92 --> 4166.80]  are you joris to both the second clone here or something because there's a can you imagine a
[4166.80 --> 4172.24]  company the size of sony and i get it big companies can still make boneheaded mistakes but can you
[4172.24 --> 4178.24]  imagine with how well known the properties of liquid metal are a company like sony being stupid enough
[4178.24 --> 4182.24]  to make it so you have to reapply your thermal interface material every three to six months like
[4182.24 --> 4190.08]  what like what are you talking about yeah and like it's cool that it seems like like the teardown
[4190.08 --> 4195.12]  experience actually seems like decently well thought out yeah not not difficult to do i
[4195.12 --> 4201.04]  remember like trying to take apart xbox 360s because those just broke all over the place so like
[4201.04 --> 4209.28]  people doing zombified repair jobs on xbox 360s was like a genuine hobby um but i i like looking at this
[4209.92 --> 4216.48]  tearing it down looks so convenient and accessing those like expansion ports and stuff seems great like
[4216.48 --> 4220.88]  i wanted to address the the like memeing that's happened like xbox tried to meme this a little
[4220.88 --> 4224.80]  bit by showing that their expansion port essentially is just like plugging something into the back of
[4224.80 --> 4232.80]  the console but like yeah but this is this is pretty cool and it's not a bad solution um and the the techie
[4232.80 --> 4240.08]  side of me likes it because it's like kind of there's a lot of modern stuff like we we've lost tactile
[4240.08 --> 4246.40]  interaction like getting a new game you just download it like you don't have the physical copy anymore
[4246.48 --> 4251.60]  it's just there like watching a movie you don't go to the store to get it it's just you just stream it
[4251.60 --> 4257.04]  like there's there's so much less that you do with things um and i think it's kind of cool that like
[4257.04 --> 4262.40]  and i i know definitely as a kid i would have even appreciated this more like if i bought an expansion
[4262.40 --> 4267.44]  thing for my playstation and i had to like take it apart like see the internals and like actually add
[4267.44 --> 4272.48]  something to this system and put it back together myself like that's such a cool experience i i wouldn't
[4272.48 --> 4279.36]  always oh my goodness the bird does not agree um i wouldn't always agree with that but because the
[4279.36 --> 4286.96]  teardown experience is actually like so good um that that makes me think more in that way you know
[4286.96 --> 4291.92]  what i mean yeah 100 i'm just reading chat jacks i'm not actually like multitasking i'm paying attention
[4291.92 --> 4299.60]  to luke too they're like linus multitasking right now no no no no no um the i love that both of the
[4299.60 --> 4306.32]  new consoles have nice large fans um i think i'm allowed to talk about that the xbox series x is
[4306.32 --> 4312.64]  quiet i'm not sure i will i won't i i hope i'm allowed to talk about it i don't know i didn't look
[4312.64 --> 4318.08]  that close there uh i'll wait i'll wait for the audio you didn't look that close yeah yeah it didn't
[4318.08 --> 4324.48]  look that close i i don't know i don't know there's there's like a whole set of like guidelines and
[4324.48 --> 4328.96]  stuff and we we haven't worked with microsoft on the console side of things that much the last thing
[4328.96 --> 4334.72]  i want to do is like say something that's technically under embargo still and like get in trouble um so
[4334.72 --> 4340.08]  we're just we're gonna take our time with it we've got a ton of xbox series x content planned so far i
[4340.08 --> 4345.20]  don't think we have any confirmation that we're even getting a playstation 5 so hopefully we are but um
[4345.76 --> 4350.96]  we'll see how that goes anyway i i love that sony went liquid metal it really does make a big
[4350.96 --> 4356.64]  difference like for the same heatsink solution if you're borderline with a more conventional
[4356.64 --> 4361.04]  thermal interface material liquid metal will probably push you across the finish line so
[4361.04 --> 4367.12]  i'm excited to see what the performance looks like regardless of the theoretical gigaflops that
[4367.12 --> 4373.84]  both sony and microsoft have been throwing around yeah um in other sony news sony revealed a list
[4373.84 --> 4378.00]  of playstation 4 games that will not run on the playstation 5.
[4378.00 --> 4386.08]  yeah dwvr afro samurai 2 tt isle of man just deal with it shadow complex remastered robinson the
[4386.08 --> 4395.60]  journey we sing hitman go shadwin and joe's diner should be all right so i i don't recognize most of
[4395.60 --> 4403.60]  these names one of them that stood out to me was hitman go because it's a mobile game yeah it should be
[4403.60 --> 4410.56]  okay it's probably fine if you really miss it oh i don't want to pull a blizzard but oh boy i was
[4410.56 --> 4415.12]  gonna say if you really miss it you can play it on your phone but like i i don't yeah i don't know i
[4415.12 --> 4420.64]  i have a feeling that's not the only one in here that's probably more on the mobile side of things
[4420.64 --> 4425.60]  yeah so uh we don't know why they won't run could be due to licensing issues there are also some general
[4425.60 --> 4430.80]  playstation 5 backwards compatibility limitations for ps4 games so the share menu can't be displayed
[4430.80 --> 4436.40]  within ps4 games running on a ps5 screenshots will need to be generated using the create button on a
[4436.40 --> 4442.32]  dual sense controller a tournaments feature from ps4 is also not compatible with the ps5 nor is in-game
[4442.32 --> 4447.76]  live or second screen apps and game companion apps so there are going to be some things that are not
[4447.76 --> 4453.28]  going to be quite the same as the original experience but with yeah just 10 titles ruled out
[4453.28 --> 4460.08]  um it looks like what we're headed towards for both microsoft and sony now that they're both just
[4460.08 --> 4468.24]  x86 boxes with amd graphics cards in them is potentially just backwards and backwards compatibility
[4468.24 --> 4474.64]  pretty much across the board like i'd be shocked if xbox whatever boneheaded thing they call it
[4474.64 --> 4484.48]  is backwards compatible with uh series x and x that isn't a series um and 360 and like all that
[4484.48 --> 4489.28]  good stuff and i'd also be surprised if sony playstation 6 because they're sensible it's
[4489.28 --> 4494.56]  probably what it'd be called is backwards compatible going way way back eesh
[4496.48 --> 4501.68]  um sony says select ps4 games will work with ps5's game boost feature that will make older ps4 games run
[4501.68 --> 4506.64]  at higher frame rates but we don't have a list of games that will support that feature just yet so
[4506.64 --> 4516.80]  i've been looking into like random games on this list uh so far uh afro samurai 2 has a 21 metacritic
[4516.80 --> 4529.92]  score oof um shadow complex was released in 2009 originally on the xbox 360 like i yeah i don't think we're
[4529.92 --> 4534.80]  yeah i think it's probably okay i think we're not missing out on much here should be all right
[4534.80 --> 4542.24]  yeah yeah i think we're all right all right so uh finally apple's t2 security chip has an unfixable flaw
[4545.76 --> 4554.88]  so now you lose your data um but hey it was all for security hey you got them uh okay so a recently
[4554.88 --> 4560.56]  released tool by hacking group check rain is letting anyone exploit an unusual mac vulnerability
[4560.56 --> 4566.72]  to bypass apple's trusted t2 security chip and gain deep system access the hack is based on the
[4566.72 --> 4570.56]  checkmate crack that has been used to jailbreak holder iphones and ipads for some time now which
[4570.56 --> 4576.72]  relies on a similar if not identical flaw in the t2 security chip the t2 chip provides secure encryption
[4576.72 --> 4581.60]  and storage access for features like touch id and full disk encryption and has been criticized for
[4581.60 --> 4586.48]  causing an inability to install third-party operating systems outside of apple's official bootcamp support
[4587.44 --> 4592.64]  one hacker has apparently even gotten the broken t2 chip to run linux on the macbook touch bar
[4592.64 --> 4598.56]  wow that's pretty cool critically for apple the access also means that activation lock can be bypassed
[4598.56 --> 4603.84]  which could result in a rise in theft in apple of apple devices that's a bummer because that's one of
[4603.84 --> 4611.04]  the things that's really nice about full disk encryption and this this kind of like uh encryption
[4611.04 --> 4619.20]  chip lockery tomfoolery is that you can basically leave a phone like if it's a if it's an encrypted
[4619.20 --> 4623.76]  device you could basically leave a phone somewhere and know that unless someone really just wants the
[4623.76 --> 4629.04]  like 14 that they'll get for giving it to a recycler there's a solid chance they'll call the number on
[4629.04 --> 4633.84]  your lock screen and try and return it to you because a locked phone is basically worthless
[4634.40 --> 4641.60]  um not anymore file vault encryption keys are also stored in the t2 which means encrypted user data is
[4641.60 --> 4646.24]  also at risk if a device is stolen this is a big deal for all the enterprises that have a bunch of apple
[4646.24 --> 4651.92]  devices deployed to their staff and the flaw is apparently virtually unpatchable as a result of its
[4651.92 --> 4656.80]  low level nature meaning that all existing t2 enabled macs are likely vulnerable and will remain
[4656.80 --> 4662.96]  vulnerable indefinitely now there's some good news um it can't be done remotely and requires physical
[4662.96 --> 4670.24]  access to the vulnerable computer and that's rule number one of like electronics security is physical
[4670.24 --> 4678.80]  access is access so basically no changes there um and it also isn't persistent so any changes to the t2
[4678.80 --> 4682.88]  are lost when it resets which is not necessarily at the same time the computer resets by the way
[4682.88 --> 4688.40]  check rain security researcher danny l tweeted that the t2 exploit isn't as big as people might think
[4688.40 --> 4693.12]  because it's been known for over a year and other more serious vulnerabilities exist this attack requires
[4693.12 --> 4698.08]  deliberate targeting to be truly scary um anthony's note is that this is interesting because if this
[4698.08 --> 4702.00]  has been known about widely in the security community it raises questions about anti-encryption
[4702.00 --> 4710.88]  legislation's rationale against apple yeah it does kind of doesn't it why do they even care if uh apple's encryption is there if it's just broken anyway
[4710.88 --> 4717.04]  if it's bad yeah yeah well that's a whole that's almost like a whole separate wang show ladies and
[4717.04 --> 4722.16]  gentlemen and we don't have time for that because luke and i gotta play video games tonight we gotta play
[4722.16 --> 4729.12]  some video games yeah but before we do that i have to address that someone just sent 1200 mexican dollars
[4729.84 --> 4737.68]  uh oh fabian says hey i got a refund on my missing order from lt store and two months later the courier
[4737.68 --> 4744.64]  finally found my shiz and i'm very happy with my order so here's the money back hey thank you appreciate
[4744.64 --> 4753.20]  that appreciate that shout out to lt store.com by the way they had an outstanding week this week
[4753.20 --> 4758.72]  apparently we have a lot of long-armed followers we launched a shirt that i was basically like yeah
[4758.72 --> 4763.84]  the fit's weird it doesn't fit me right it's got like super long arms so if like you have long arms then
[4763.84 --> 4770.72]  go ahead and order it and all these people bought it it was our it was our biggest sales day ever
[4771.44 --> 4778.32]  i was like okay sure so apparently that's the solution we need to start targeting niche fits so
[4780.32 --> 4784.88]  are nerds is that a is that a trait is that a common trait nerds i didn't think so
[4785.84 --> 4789.28]  but i mean the thing is you got like enough you gotta you got 300 000 people
[4789.28 --> 4795.44]  so even if you know one percent of them have long arms that's like a lot of shirts it's like 3 000
[4795.44 --> 4801.60]  shirts right so yeah and if you consistently have a problem with the the sleeves on your shirts being
[4801.60 --> 4807.92]  too short and you hear like hey this shirt has long arms yeah i could see that being like a need you
[4807.92 --> 4812.96]  already know the qualities there yeah it's it's probably a really cool shirt so if it fits you better
[4812.96 --> 4818.64]  like sweet sure what else so yeah that that's the new concept okay is we're gonna do like kind of weird
[4818.64 --> 4825.36]  fits like hey if you have super stumpy legs we've got we've got the jobbers for you don't keep buying
[4825.36 --> 4830.32]  capri pants you know and then wearing them as regular pants these are regular pants they're just
[4830.32 --> 4836.32]  short they're just really short yeah was that the what what shirt was that uh the short circuit one
[4836.88 --> 4843.28]  yeah it looks really cool too yeah it's really nice uh do you have rtx voice on and is it still coming
[4843.28 --> 4849.44]  through i i don't have rtx voice because i don't have oh that's right oh sorry sorry i don't speak
[4849.44 --> 4856.96]  poor people i think yeah economically sound is how i prefer to say it yeah yeah but yeah it's a really
[4856.96 --> 4862.08]  cool shirt and i like the sleeve art i think it's yeah it's dope i'm not going to bring it up on screen
[4862.08 --> 4866.72]  because i don't need that many more people buying it because i think we moved through like basically
[4866.72 --> 4871.84]  almost all of our initial inventory so i'm not i'm not i'm not supposed to push ltt store that hard this
[4871.84 --> 4876.48]  week because our shippers like way backed up and like we've moved through most of those shirts and
[4876.48 --> 4882.16]  stuff so maybe next week we'll have a launch for you or something uh sergey says uh is there any
[4882.16 --> 4886.88]  difference in features between rtx 2000 and 3000 or is it just performance as far as i can tell it's
[4886.88 --> 4894.00]  just performance um there is some new video encode and decode stuff um but i actually don't quote me on
[4894.00 --> 4900.64]  that because i think rtx 2000 might be getting like backported some of the features of rtx 3000
[4901.84 --> 4909.20]  um does rtx 2000 get like the vp1 decoding oh dang it you cha you called me on this live
[4909.92 --> 4919.60]  uh vp1 decoding video decoding encode support matrix oh boy nvidia design works here we go
[4920.64 --> 4928.72]  um um um um dang it where's um where's wait do they not have ampere on here yet
[4928.72 --> 4940.96]  dang it nvidia vp1 uh vp1's not even on here okay well i got i got nothing for you i'm sorry guys
[4940.96 --> 4948.80]  ampere's not on here yet so uh i don't remember there oh crap i hate getting uh blindsided by stuff
[4948.80 --> 4955.84]  like this and then not knowing speaking of uh blindsided but you will know um it's also sorry
[4955.84 --> 4959.36]  that was actually my bad with the bird he was asking for food and i was just ignoring him and
[4959.36 --> 4966.96]  i didn't realize it but uh amazon story you applied at amazon oh right oh man i don't know we might have
[4966.96 --> 4974.96]  to talk about this next week i'm hungry okay okay sorry guys or or uh are you gonna stream games tonight
[4974.96 --> 4983.20]  um i don't know yet i haven't decided okay okay um uh someone brought up hdmi 2.1 yes that is a new
[4983.20 --> 4989.84]  feature so being able to run 4k at 120 hertz but then like sort of related to performance there's no
[4989.84 --> 4997.84]  there's no need for it if you uh there's no need for it if you don't have a 3000 series basically um
[4997.84 --> 5004.88]  mentendo asks are those six six xx or 58x on your head linus these are hd 600s these are neither these
[5004.88 --> 5013.04]  are older so they're very similar to the 6x x's uh fan 24 drr says if you expect something in return
[5013.04 --> 5016.96]  from someone on the other side of vancouver is that a quid pro co quitlam
[5016.96 --> 5029.28]  what the response was great okay uh henry stickman says would watch entire wan show but
[5029.28 --> 5037.36]  hollow live vtubers are live so here so sent whatever 500 phps are i don't know what kind
[5037.36 --> 5042.96]  of money that is uh urmama's llama says your mama's llama i want to buy some ltd underwear but my wife
[5042.96 --> 5046.64]  won't let me unless they have linus's face on them i am serious and i really want to make this happen
[5047.36 --> 5051.84]  it's possible anything is possible we've got our new underwear supplier totally sorted out we've got
[5051.84 --> 5057.20]  the fit fixed i was wearing them this week i tried the mediums i think nick tried the larges
[5058.08 --> 5062.64]  i think the entire sizing chart is now the same as the old ones so we are ready to rock on them and
[5062.64 --> 5067.12]  there's going to be some new designs and hopefully we'll be able to roll them more quickly now i have
[5067.12 --> 5073.92]  a bone to pick with you and the ltd store team okay what they do you have cool you have cool designs
[5073.92 --> 5084.48]  mm-hmm high quality prices are banging where's your masks dude okay so we have a sample of a mask
[5084.48 --> 5090.16]  design i didn't really like it i didn't really like the fit um as you probably know we don't launch
[5090.16 --> 5095.84]  anything that i'm not 100 happy with other than that shirt which i basically didn't even try to sell
[5095.84 --> 5099.04]  it i was like oh the arms are too long but then apparently you guys are into that so i don't know
[5099.04 --> 5104.80]  whatever um i wasn't happy with it basically and it wasn't the design that i really wanted
[5104.80 --> 5112.00]  i wanted to do a subnet mask so i wanted to just have like 255.255.255.0 and then like some other
[5112.00 --> 5116.16]  common subnets down one side i thought that'd be like super cool and then i got some other design
[5116.16 --> 5119.68]  that was like based on our circuit board thing and it's like yeah it looks all right but i wanted the
[5119.68 --> 5123.76]  subnet mask and i'm not really willing to launch anything other than that so that's my take on it right
[5123.76 --> 5128.24]  now okay well you guys should figure that out because it seems like the whole mask thing is
[5128.24 --> 5134.64]  probably here to stay for a while so yeah i know right um no name i booted up my old android phone
[5134.64 --> 5139.12]  to send you my google play balance uh thank you twelve dollars and twelve cents uh okay
[5140.80 --> 5147.52]  uh i'll do like two more uh ben roberts asks linus only fans when i don't know how much the wife would
[5147.52 --> 5152.32]  like it there that's gonna be my excuse i'm gonna hide you guys could do you guys could do an only
[5152.32 --> 5163.44]  fans that was purely uh like uh uh uh peels i can't remember the oh that's lame if i'm not if
[5163.44 --> 5169.60]  i'm not gonna get lewd i'm not gonna do it there that's kind of uh daniel says like peels and like
[5169.60 --> 5178.72]  graphics card cooler removals no no no no if i think you guys would get some if you're gonna be on the
[5178.72 --> 5186.24]  site you might as well do um all right daniel says you're amazing thanks daniel you too uh dark guy
[5186.24 --> 5192.32]  asks if we will review the eve spectrum 4k monitor would absolutely love to uh ryan asks you getting
[5192.32 --> 5196.24]  much use out of the bath gaming rig haven't really been gaming much but i have been watching tv in the
[5196.24 --> 5201.44]  bath it's been great my kids love it too uh ryzen 5000 better for gaming except intel still has the
[5201.44 --> 5208.08]  highest single core clock speed clock speed oh come on come on bro come on what year is it sure
[5208.08 --> 5214.32]  i'm sure i'm sure linus media group somewhere has a good video about that and i'm also sure that like
[5214.32 --> 5218.72]  gamers nexus i i named him because he makes a lot of those types of videos but i'm sure a lot of other
[5218.72 --> 5223.44]  people have videos about that too it is not just clock speed my dude okay so i posted that in the
[5223.44 --> 5230.48]  youtube chat there's our video addressing it on tech quickie um all right that's it thank you guys
[5230.48 --> 5238.16]  very much for tuning in this week we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[5238.16 --> 5245.20]  bye
