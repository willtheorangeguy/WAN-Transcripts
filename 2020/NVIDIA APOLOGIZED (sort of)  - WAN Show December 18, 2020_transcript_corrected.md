[0.00 → 15.84] and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you lined up today
[15.84 → 24.20] NVIDIA apologized to some people uh for the whole shenanigans that went on last week we'll
[24.20 → 30.74] talk about that a little bit in other news devotion has been pulled from good old games in
[30.74 → 38.78] yet more positive PR for CD project red remember when CD project red was like the darlings and
[38.78 → 47.14] now they're like everyone yeah over the course of like a three-week period just yeah a little
[47.14 → 52.06] little a little uncomfortable a little uncomfortable what else we got this week
[52.06 → 58.92] google is getting sued in antitrust um in a case that should probably go along with a
[58.92 → 68.58] finally um and then also there was a massive hack of the CDC time war cable U.S. air force
[68.58 → 75.90] U.S. department of defence U.S. postal service U.S. uh Secret Service visa USA um all of those are
[75.90 → 82.00] maybe a little sketchy because SolarWinds Orion software was hacked Sophie daisies hooray
[82.00 → 83.06] intro time
[83.06 → 107.78] this is great loft wanderer says I feel bad for CD project red
[107.78 → 116.32] do you though do you really did they not make their own bed here like i uh I don't know I don't
[116.32 → 122.12] know if they're the victim um why don't we jump right into our first topic of the week which is of
[122.12 → 131.98] course NVIDIA apologizing sort of now when I say sort of I don't mean that they sort of apologized to
[131.98 → 138.52] hardware unboxed in fact the apology to hardware unboxed was uh pretty, pretty good sounding to me
[138.52 → 144.04] uh he went ahead and published it I can't remember where but I think it's in my Twitter dm so I'm just
[144.04 → 150.70] going to read it out from there uh oh man we got so much Twitter dm going on here
[150.70 → 160.02] oh there's a big history Luke if you can find it sooner ah here it is um all right this is great
[160.02 → 165.96] great message from him yeah this reads like BDR actually wrote it hi steve I wanted to reach out
[165.96 → 172.82] again and apologize for my previous email it was not well worded and maybe impacted by a bit of
[172.82 → 178.72] lockdown fatigue we absolutely respect the press and their editorial integrity we welcome you and
[178.72 → 184.60] hardware unboxed to NDA press briefings access to press material early press drivers and access to our
[184.60 → 190.18] partner slash AIC boards as well as founders edition boards let me know if you have any questions
[190.18 → 197.74] Brian del Rizzo, and you know what that does read a lot more to me like it was actually written by BDR
[197.74 → 203.66] which the other one to be clear so many people have raised their pitchforks calling for Brian del
[203.66 → 215.04] Rizzo's head guys here's the thing Brian del Rizzo works for NVIDIA um an email like that never goes out
[215.04 → 224.88] without prior approval from someone I mean he's gonna usually be that someone he would usually be
[224.88 → 230.28] that someone which is why the fact that it was signed by him means someone else looked at
[230.28 → 237.30] if there is always another set of eyes on a communication like that and the fact that it
[237.30 → 244.86] doesn't sound like it was written by him at all means that clearly this was a must have
[244.86 → 251.22] been a whole mess of a thing over there and on the subject of messes of a thing it was pretty clear
[251.22 → 259.28] why NVIDIA immediately walked it back but the question that I have Luke for you is you feel
[259.28 → 266.94] like they issued their apology the next day like it happened literally the day after the wan show it was
[266.94 → 273.32] on Saturday that they issued the first apology then they sent out another message it was either
[273.32 → 279.64] the day after or on Monday or something like that does you think NVIDIA apologized because they're sorry
[279.64 → 288.00] or because they're sorry they got caught that's what I want to know I don't know i one of the issues
[288.00 → 294.18] with entities that big is I know they become personified and that's like literally a thing
[294.18 → 300.54] beyond just perception like that's a way that things work but um it is so many different moving parts
[300.54 → 306.96] and like having worked with them before I would definitely say that some people there were
[306.96 → 314.18] probably sorry and that some people there were probably sorry that they got caught um and I don't
[314.18 → 320.98] I don't necessarily know which one the overall is I'm not sure if um I don't see
[320.98 → 328.24] this doesn't necessarily look like the exact same one I'm seeing but the one you're reading did it
[328.24 → 336.92] end with van comma BDR uh this one says um no just Brian del Rizzo
[336.92 → 342.84] yeah okay so here one second I just want to send you this
[342.84 → 343.46] sure
[343.46 → 353.28] and checking chat okay, so this is a different one uh Brian del Rizzo has reached out a second time
[353.28 → 357.90] so this was posted on Twitter by hardware unboxed okay some people are asking for a little bit of
[357.90 → 362.88] context for this they apparently missed when show last week uh NVIDIA reached out to hardware
[362.88 → 371.10] unboxed uh tech YouTuber and basically said if you guys don't get in line with how we feel about ray
[371.10 → 376.68] tracing being the future of gaming and if you guys don't put more emphasis on ray tracing performance
[376.68 → 383.14] in your reviews we are not going to continue to seed you founders edition cards which is a lot bigger
[383.14 → 387.76] of a deal than it sounds like because not getting seated founders' edition cards basically means you
[387.76 → 394.22] can't do launch day content um you now and then the end of it was really the worst I don't know what
[394.22 → 399.12] the worst part it was one of the worst parts for sure the end of it was should your editorial
[399.12 → 405.54] direction change we'd be happy to revisit this or something along those lines it was brutal
[405.54 → 414.68] um so we took issue with that because it was an attack on not just hardware unboxed's uh editorial
[414.68 → 421.06] freedom to review the product as they see fit but also a shot across the bow of pretty much
[421.06 → 428.84] anyone who covers tech and who is at the mercy of NVIDIA to cut them off and harm their business
[428.84 → 435.12] and so we took issue with that uh we called out we called it out, and they walked it back basically
[435.12 → 440.04] immediately so the first email was the one I'm about to read now hi Steve thanks for your note i
[440.04 → 444.28] just wanted to say again how sorry I am for my original email I overstepped my bounds, and it's as
[444.28 → 448.72] simple as that I love seeing all the ways reviewers test and report on our products and I value your
[448.72 → 452.48] contributions suggesting that I would withhold samples because I didn't agree with your commentary
[452.48 → 457.38] is simply inexcusable and crossed the line so that's the thing it didn't suggest it was
[457.38 → 463.62] it was a statement very clear I failed myself my colleagues and the amazing community of reviewers
[463.62 → 468.30] I consider my friends you all work so hard in service of the gaming industry we love you deserved
[468.30 → 472.10] better from me, I hope you will forgive my mistake and give me the opportunity to be of service to you
[472.10 → 475.66] in the future it would be great if you can share this with your fans so they know how I feel
[475.66 → 479.80] that was the first retraction
[479.80 → 490.46] so you haven't so you basically are saying some people at NVIDIA are sorry and some are sorry they
[490.46 → 496.04] got caught is that the vibe I think so because you got to remember it's not like this is
[496.04 → 501.34] the first time NVIDIA has ever behaved in an anti-partner or anti-consumer manner
[501.34 → 507.18] yeah i just think with a company that size I think it's like if you tried to
[507.18 → 514.84] if you said like okay you know what i am globally personifying this um everyone is upset
[514.84 → 522.58] about the banner being over our chins apparently are we both too low in frame there I fixed it goes ahead
[522.58 → 530.90] um i just yeah I don't know if we're deciding like no we have to decide a general attitude for
[530.90 → 536.40] the company as a whole I would I mean especially after reading that it feels that they're sorry they
[536.40 → 544.50] got caught I suggesting that I would yeah no BS, and then it would be great if you could share this
[544.50 → 550.34] with your fans please I don't want the heat on me anymore yeah it feels like they're sorry they got
[550.34 → 557.00] caught um i but I am also certain that there are people there that are sorry in general that's all
[557.00 → 562.98] I'm saying I'm sure I mean I know for a fact i I can't get anyone on the record about any of this
[562.98 → 567.34] which is very frustrating but I know for a fact there are people at NVIDIA that were just like
[567.34 → 575.26] I don't even have any marketing like training and I read that email and I was immediately like
[575.26 → 582.32] how was this going to be anything but a disaster like a raging ball of fire coming down upon us
[582.32 → 586.92] like what could they possibly have been thinking one of the interesting things that stood out to me
[586.92 → 596.20] and I'm probably chasing a nothingburger, but the original email was signed off so form formally yeah
[596.20 → 602.78] and it had his full name and then I think it had the like in quotes BDR thing yeah this one's just
[602.78 → 608.78] BDR yeah well I've I have seen Brian sign emails lots of different ways so it's I don't know it's
[608.78 → 614.02] tough it's tough to draw a conclusion there like if we want to get into like you know forensic typing
[614.02 → 620.44] word analysis it feels like maybe either like maybe one of them is sent because your email is
[620.44 → 624.92] probably going to auto signature so like one of them is sent from like a team account one of them is
[624.92 → 631.42] sent from sure his own I don't know I have no idea it's just i just it feels so weird to me that
[631.42 → 636.10] it's its being handled this way at all so I'm trying to like pick it apart and be like
[636.10 → 642.48] who the heck is even involved because it's hard to tell uh Patrick h says you all need to realize this
[642.48 → 647.28] wasn't BDR's decision to make he had to write the hard email and is the messenger he definitely could
[647.28 → 651.68] have felt bad writing the email in the first place that's happened before for sure yeah but i just
[651.68 → 659.60] don't believe that's how it went down um i to be clear I don't believe that like i I don't know i
[659.60 → 667.86] honestly I've been trying to get someone from NVIDIA including BDR to talk to me about this and
[667.86 → 676.80] pretty much the answer has been um we emailed Steve it's water under the bridge that's all i
[676.80 → 685.24] have to say about that and my response to that is a couple of things um number one is okay you've
[685.24 → 690.74] addressed that you did the wrong thing, but you haven't explained how that ever could have possibly
[690.74 → 697.42] happened in the first place and without a post-mortem on this honestly the apology rings kind
[697.42 → 704.72] of hollow for me and number two is you apologized to Steve but Steve wasn't the only member of the
[704.72 → 712.84] media that was outraged that you or someone respected us so little and while technically
[712.84 → 721.12] you only like punched out at one thing the community feels the hit like it's its if you're
[721.12 → 728.04] if you're a lord over some lands, and you go roll into someone's place and take a bunch of their stuff
[728.04 → 733.46] everyone's going to be freaked out, and you need to address everybody yeah so
[733.46 → 743.76] yeah Hans Von twitchy says the first email was full of PR speak they expected it to leak
[743.76 → 748.32] they didn't expect the magnitude of backlash they did want to strong-arm the community
[748.32 → 755.20] just didn't expect the community to fight back um that's that's my read on it right now I just still
[755.20 → 759.58] don't know what the forces at play within NVIDIA are and this is something that it would be very
[759.58 → 765.26] easy for me to drop if I could get someone over there to just talk to me and say look this is what
[765.26 → 772.64] happened um I'm not going to go on the record you cannot talk about this I would accept that um but
[772.64 → 779.52] you know the person who is boneheaded enough to have thought that that was a good idea you know
[779.52 → 785.28] they're not going to they're not going to interact with the media any more um and or they're too senior
[785.28 → 790.50] um you know there's ultimately nothing we can do about it, but that's how it went down you know
[790.50 → 797.08] whatever it is because the explanation here is guys don't pick up your pitchforks and go
[797.08 → 803.54] after BDR I don't actually think, and it was my initial reaction my midterm reaction and even now that
[803.54 → 810.46] I've done more digging talk to some NVIDIA partners it is still my reaction that that did not sound like
[810.46 → 817.90] something he would write it sounds like something that for whatever reason he had to sign and it
[817.90 → 826.68] doesn't make a ton of sense to me um so they apologized to hardware unboxed they have not actually
[826.68 → 832.48] addressed the cause of the behaviour uh they haven't addressed how they're going to avoid the behaviour in
[832.48 → 838.74] the future so to me this is a little like um you know a parent uh hitting one of their kids
[838.74 → 847.26] coming back and saying hey I'm sorry uh here's some ice cream and an Xbox and uh all the other kids are
[847.26 → 856.90] like yo what the was that, and they're like see you later um you know there's no like hey I was drinking
[856.90 → 862.12] and I'm not gonna drink any more there's no uh yeah you know what I'm sorry you guys
[862.12 → 867.16] yeah I'm sorry you guys had to see that it's just um
[867.16 → 877.66] yep uh okay bye-bye we're not the same company that brought you GeForce partner program um we're
[877.66 → 885.64] we're not the same company that literally told 3dfx employees to burn the drivers instead of releasing
[885.64 → 890.94] like updated drivers for 3dfx cards no, no we're not that company we really we've learned you know
[890.94 → 898.22] we're cool now we're good we're nice um you know don't worry about that i I don't know i just uh
[900.70 → 906.94] it kind of if i have to guess, and you know maybe every time I talk about this i am poisoning
[906.94 → 913.10] the well even further uh with respect to my chances of ever having a good relationship with NVIDIA again
[913.10 → 921.34] um but the only conclusion that I can really draw here is that the toxicity goes up very, very high
[924.30 → 930.62] yeah that's that's the only real conclusion I can draw like the fact that these things happen
[931.18 → 941.50] NVIDIA treats partners with contempt and nothing ever changes um means that it's just the attitude there
[942.22 → 948.06] and I know there are exceptions I know for a fact there are exceptions but maybes this is the kind
[948.06 → 953.26] of thing that like at this point I've got nothing left to lose, and it just requires a dedicated video
[953.26 → 960.94] about it just like look these are all the things that you talk to literally any NVIDIA partner about
[961.58 → 967.66] and they can talk your ear off about the kind of that NVIDIA puts them through, but they're in no
[967.66 → 975.34] position to speak out because either it's above their pay grade um or b they would be they would
[975.34 → 982.86] be fired, or they would negatively impact their company you should go like full you should get like
[982.86 → 988.14] an outside not related to the tech industry investigative journalist
[988.14 → 998.54] and just like to have them host the video and everything that'd be interesting um yeah meat
[998.54 → 1005.18] says NVIDIA screwed AIB's hard this gen yeah I mean that's yet another just like I don't even know what
[1005.18 → 1012.86] the point is like who benefits I don't think anybody benefited from NVIDIA giving themselves
[1012.86 → 1022.14] such a leg up in terms of board design for the RTX 30 series like why it doesn't benefit consumers
[1022.14 → 1029.74] because the vast majority of consumers are going to be buying AIB cards not NVIDIA founders edition cards
[1029.74 → 1037.10] it doesn't benefit NVIDIA because it ends up creating negative PR when there's like launch boards failing it
[1037.10 → 1043.58] it doesn't benefit their AIBS because they have to either recall or fix boards on their way out to
[1043.58 → 1050.54] consumers uh, or they have to you know pay a bunch of overtime, and you know go into crunch mode for no
[1050.54 → 1056.46] reason whatsoever in order to get a good quality product out there in time for launch like it doesn't
[1056.46 → 1061.66] benefit consumers did I already say that because they get they have a chance to get broken products for
[1061.66 → 1071.02] no reason like what is the point why why why are you doing this why don't you just be cool you know
[1071.90 → 1075.74] why don't you just be cool chill out a little bit I don't get it
[1079.34 → 1086.46] I don't know anyway why don't we just move on to our next topic because at this point I don't think
[1086.46 → 1091.66] they're ever going to address it and I don't think that there's anything I can do to change them
[1092.22 → 1096.14] yeah they've they've been in this situation a number of times, and they just never say anything
[1096.14 → 1103.02] about it yeah or if they do say something it's like sorry we're not going to fundamentally change
[1103.02 → 1110.86] anything about our attitude but yeah we're definitely sorry yeah it's um, but they're kind of their kind
[1110.86 → 1114.30] of too big to fail in that way too they have so much momentum people are just going to keep buying
[1114.30 → 1118.38] their stuff oh of course, and they have so much momentum in the enterprise space as well which
[1118.38 → 1124.38] tends to have a lot less um reaction to these types of things yep well you consumers don't ever
[1124.38 → 1132.70] even end up hearing about it yeah so why don't we jump right into uh the devotion Gog china thing do
[1132.70 → 1138.70] you want to run us through what went down here sure yeah CD project red um i I think if you should
[1138.70 → 1143.98] should we actually hold on should we do this out of order can you just recap your uh cyberpunk 2077
[1143.98 → 1151.74] review first for me dude I told you i I okay so I played for like two hours, and it was just it was
[1151.74 → 1155.50] just horrible I don't remember the exact amount of time I played for, but it wasn't very long and
[1156.46 → 1164.30] honestly probably about half an hour in it was just like morbid curiosity of like is this really this bad
[1164.94 → 1172.38] um and they i I don't know my the thing that I went over was they took this incredibly uh
[1172.38 → 1175.98] uh like sorry I just keep getting absolutely spammed once i
[1180.38 → 1183.50] okay I'm back um it's it
[1185.50 → 1192.06] there 's's so much life in it in terms of what it looks like yeah the city is beautiful, but it is
[1192.06 → 1199.74] completely, completely lifeless there 's's nothing to it the AI also feels fake the conversations
[1199.74 → 1207.58] feel bad the story is not very engaging there's like it's just it, and it feels quite a bit
[1208.62 → 1213.10] when something is this hyped up even if it was entirely hyped up by the community and not the
[1213.10 → 1218.06] company which is not the case but even if that was it you feel kind of lied to in these scenarios
[1218.06 → 1228.86] um so the biggest own was probably cyberpunk 2077 being removed from the PlayStation
[1228.86 → 1234.86] store this week uh do you want to run through this or yeah so Sony announced late Thursday that it would
[1234.86 → 1241.82] offer full refunds to people who purchased cyberpunk 2077 and that is uh kind of sort of what I was alluding
[1241.82 → 1247.18] to previously the feels like you relied to thing yeah because you see all this footage from the game
[1247.18 → 1256.14] and then the footage from the uh the like original PS4 and original Xbox versions is if you haven't seen
[1256.14 → 1262.62] if it's like actually hilarious it doesn't even remotely look like the same game I don't know if you can
[1262.62 → 1268.78] find any of it Linus um but it is looks like a literally completely different game like it's
[1268.78 → 1277.10] uh the fact that they were okay with selling that to anyone at any level is hilarious um one really
[1277.10 → 1282.22] hilarious thing that I saw was people pointed out that there's a like collector's edition of the
[1282.22 → 1289.34] console, and it barely runs on the like cyberpunk 2077 collectors edition version of the console and
[1289.34 → 1298.62] it barely runs so that was pretty great um, but yeah cyberpunk went or CD project red went from like
[1298.78 → 1304.22] the absolute darling of the industry like something that I found interesting for a long time was they
[1304.22 → 1311.74] would do these posts um which is something along the lines of like buy the Witcher or buy cyberpunk
[1311.74 → 1319.90] on Gog and CD project red gets 100 of the proceeds like because you're you're like funding this tiny indie
[1319.90 → 1327.66] company is what it feels like but yeah, but they're actually uh a Goliath uh yeah they're massive and
[1327.66 → 1334.22] there's all this stuff coming out about like these like insane crunch times um but then the game
[1334.94 → 1341.74] looks horrible on old hardware yeah, and it's just not really winning in the reviews department i
[1341.74 → 1348.94] haven't even looked this up since last show but I'm going to look it up right now user score has increased
[1348.94 → 1355.34] a little bit the metacritic score or the reviewer meta score has gone down to 87
[1355.34 → 1366.06] um out of 100 the user score has gone up to 7.1 out of 10. Sony making the move to allow to
[1366.06 → 1372.46] basically pull it from the store though i I don't think that has this been done before just based on
[1372.46 → 1379.98] people feeling so baited on by a game because it's not like it's not like Sony has pulled a game for
[1379.98 → 1387.82] being bad and that's not really what they're doing here yeah like it's not it's not that bad it's just
[1388.86 → 1397.02] not what people expected but especially visually and like actual gameplay style like there's
[1397.02 → 1404.78] there are examples of assets not loading in so you can just like walk through them right because the
[1404.78 → 1410.06] asset hasn't actually loaded yet, and then you're like glitched in a wall and like or something else
[1410.06 → 1418.38] is going on like it's just it's its basically broken on the old consoles um so yeah I don't know
[1418.38 → 1424.46] Microsoft is also offering refunds to the game but has not taken it off the store yet um city project
[1424.46 → 1432.70] red has posted a few updates apologizing for their situation um yeah the refund from the PlayStation
[1432.70 → 1437.50] store is not automatic you do need to request it and I've heard there are some issues with that
[1437.50 → 1443.50] process although I think that happens almost any time a massive amount of people request refunds
[1443.50 → 1450.22] is the process of getting that refund comes a little bit clogged um I haven't heard anyone crying
[1450.22 → 1458.38] actual foul play there yet just that it gets a little clogged um but yeah it's its interesting the
[1458.38 → 1463.26] game won't be removed from your library if you choose to keep it which is interesting as well
[1465.26 → 1471.66] sorry um but yeah I don't think there's a ton else to say there it was ripped apparently
[1471.66 → 1476.62] digital foundry I haven't seen this actually, but it's probably fantastic digital foundry has a video
[1477.58 → 1484.62] talking about all of its issues on last gen and like yeah it looks so rough even just like having
[1484.62 → 1495.58] skimmed through the yeah 810p 1440 by 810 dynamic resolution like yeah, and it's not running at great
[1495.58 → 1502.30] frame rates like there's there are some parts of the game that they said were basically unplayable on last
[1502.30 → 1510.78] gen consoles just because they were so um they were there was so much motion and the animations were so
[1511.42 → 1518.54] stutter that you just kind of couldn't complete the objective which is pretty which is pretty tough
[1518.54 → 1524.78] and sort of raises the question like a know did CD project red ever like try to play through this game
[1525.42 → 1532.70] and b if they didn't then why did they seem like they went out of their way to not show the community
[1532.70 → 1537.82] any footage of the game running on those consoles like yeah it's one of those things where i kind of
[1537.82 → 1542.14] look at it and I go you know yeah I understand you want to sell as many copies of the game as
[1542.14 → 1547.58] possible, and you also want to be inclusive to as many people as possible who want to play it not
[1547.58 → 1553.02] everybody can afford a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox series and even if they could not, everybody can
[1553.02 → 1556.70] even get their hands on it right now so yeah you want when you launch your game you want to
[1558.30 → 1564.62] you want people to be able to play it, but maybe this is one of those situations where it should
[1564.62 → 1571.18] have just been a next gen exclusive slash pc title that simple you know
[1573.50 → 1579.98] ah I think even and like maybe I'm wrong here but I think even releasing a thing and like putting a
[1579.98 → 1584.46] warning on the store when you buy it um like if you try to buy it you're on one of those old consoles
[1584.46 → 1590.14] having a warning that you have to say yes to saying like this is going to run poorly when you buy this
[1590.14 → 1594.38] you're getting it on both consoles you should really play it on the new console, but you do have
[1594.38 → 1600.14] access to it on this one I think that would have alleviated some frustrations and then CD project red
[1600.14 → 1610.46] went and made their PR troubles worse let's talk about devotion yeah okay so devotion uh is like a
[1610.46 → 1617.74] horror game as far as I know uh that had some controversial things in it um it has it contains
[1617.74 → 1625.66] unflattering references to Chinese president did it did in the initial release on steam it did and
[1625.66 → 1632.86] some of the backstory there is that this is a Taiwanese developer um, and it's not just like
[1632.86 → 1641.58] the CCP it's not just the Chinese Communist Party that gets upset about um the whole Taiwan is it part of
[1641.58 → 1649.34] china is it not part of china question um there's actually a lot of just people who live in China
[1649.34 → 1657.42] who do not see it from the Taiwanese perspective as one way of putting it, so there's a lot of
[1657.42 → 1663.74] sensitivity around that topic so a Taiwanese developer having like you know Winnie the pooh
[1663.74 → 1672.06] uh memes about you know china's uh direct political statements for sure like they were trying to
[1672.62 → 1680.54] aggravate um now with that or not it's just it's that's true uh the developer did say after the
[1680.54 → 1685.66] release that uh you know those were placeholder assets and were never meant to be seen in the final
[1685.66 → 1693.66] release but uh it wasn't enough to stem the backlash, so way back in spring 2019 it was pulled from steam
[1693.66 → 1700.78] in all territories for red candle the developer to perform unspecified fixes, but then it just like
[1701.58 → 1708.94] never returned so now let's fast-forward to today what just happened uh Gog pulled it off their
[1708.94 → 1716.94] platform uh red candle released a or where's Gog's statement one second Gog announced on Twitter that
[1716.94 → 1723.18] after receiving many messages from gamers they decided to not list their game in their store
[1723.18 → 1728.06] red candle also put out a statement saying that though regretful we are willing to understand and
[1728.06 → 1734.94] respect Gog's decisions and for and okay, so there's a different statement for the players looking
[1734.94 → 1739.90] forward to devotions re-release please accept our most sincere apology this is a difficult predicament
[1739.90 → 1747.58] to overcome, but we won't stop striving so uh red candle games had tweeted earlier this week that the
[1747.58 → 1754.94] game would come out on Gog on December 18th and the store link has since been pulled it's gone so
[1754.94 → 1763.74] there's speculation in the community and by speculation I mean um people are basically pretty sure what's
[1763.74 → 1770.78] going on here that this had nothing to do with gamers reaching out to CD project red being upset that
[1770.78 → 1777.02] they were going to have the game on their store, and it seems like if you go on a platform like twitter
[1777.02 → 1785.26] that gamers are pretty much unanimous in their belief that CD project red who owns Gog for those
[1785.26 → 1790.38] who don't know I don't think we ever actually clarified that CD project red is just kowtowing
[1790.38 → 1796.54] to the Chinese government and is refusing to have anything controversial on their platform in order to
[1796.54 → 1804.70] keep from running afoul of the CCP however it's important to note that twitter is banned in China
[1805.66 → 1811.42] so I was just going to say yeah that's not the gamer thing could actually be true
[1813.82 → 1819.18] like, but it might not be a demographic that you're going to see on Twitter exactly so it might be
[1819.18 → 1824.14] something where you just don't have exposure to the gamers who are upset about this it could be
[1824.70 → 1831.02] Chinese gamers now that's not to say that you shouldn't still be outraged at everyone whether
[1831.02 → 1838.62] it's CD project red or valve or epic games or anyone for not allowing this game on their store because at
[1838.62 → 1846.38] the end of the day um there are a couple of questions here right like there's uh there's what do gamers
[1846.38 → 1853.50] think of it and then there's just you know what's more important um being free to criticize the
[1853.50 → 1860.54] government or not being free to criticize the government um and yes these are private platforms
[1860.54 → 1865.66] there it's not in a private space and if you want to talk about like American first amendment rights to
[1866.22 → 1872.94] to free speech they only really apply to public forums uh public areas of discussion
[1872.94 → 1879.26] um and being critical of the government it doesn't apply in private places, and it doesn't
[1879.26 → 1887.34] apply to criticizing private businesses, but it's still supposed to be a guiding principle, and it's
[1887.34 → 1894.22] something that people are still understandably extremely upset with CD project red for not
[1894.22 → 1903.42] standing up for even if it was actual customers who were angry that they were allowing this type of
[1903.42 → 1911.50] political speech which isn't even apparently in the game any more they're just they don't want to hear
[1911.50 → 1916.38] from this developer ever again because they have the audacity to say something negative about the Chinese
[1916.38 → 1926.06] government um there are still um there are still games from red candle games available on steam
[1926.06 → 1931.98] I'm not 100 certain about Gog I could check um so like as a developer they haven't been entirely axed
[1931.98 → 1942.46] yet um, but this game in particular is not being allowed to see light it's fascinating to me to have so much
[1942.46 → 1951.90] um so much sort of nationalistic pride that the mere fact that a game criticizes you know the leader of
[1951.90 → 1962.62] my country makes me like enraged like uh I don't I don't get it maybe this is just like a Canadian thing
[1962.62 → 1969.50] like I don't have like any kind of personal if someone's like yeah Justin Trudeau he's he's dumb or bad
[1969.50 → 1979.34] I'm like okay that's all right that's your that's your opinion um you know like yeah it's
[1979.34 → 1985.82] a very different depending on the context I might even agree with you uh it depends what we're talking
[1985.82 → 1993.74] about uh that's been that's been widely accepted here for a long time um like there there were
[1993.74 → 2000.62] were games I remember on like addictinggames.com yeah that like we're making fun of American presidents
[2001.26 → 2009.42] um, and it's like yeah so what and just no one cared at all um but so it's strongly different
[2009.42 → 2019.34] mentality um it's hard to speak for a place that we've spent extremely little time in and know not
[2019.34 → 2025.50] enough about sorry see people seem to be seen people seem to be under the impression that I am
[2025.50 → 2034.06] somehow siding with the CCP right now what sometimes i just i I look at the comments on this
[2034.06 → 2041.26] show and I go what alternate YouTube window did you have opened while you were commenting on my video
[2041.26 → 2049.90] you know is there anything that I've said that sounds anything like CD project red was right to
[2049.90 → 2055.66] pull this game all I was saying is that there 's there could be legitimacy around it being
[2056.22 → 2063.42] users that are pointing it out yes that it's just it's its probably users from a very specific area
[2063.42 → 2071.18] users from a very specific area that have very limited access to alternate views um access
[2071.18 → 2076.54] users from a very specific area that have access to censored media um and so you know i I get it
[2077.74 → 2083.90] not I get it i I see it i just I have a very difficult time putting me in that putting myself in that
[2083.90 → 2093.26] kind of headspace to think that you know somehow uh an attack on you know the leader's appearance of
[2093.26 → 2101.10] my country is like this like personal attack on me as a person uh i I don't understand if it's bizarre to
[2101.10 → 2108.62] me i I've always kind of had the view of like if is it's a very respectful leader they shouldn't
[2108.62 → 2114.22] care about something that petty and unimportant anyway um Hans Von twitchy says USA and Canada
[2114.22 → 2119.98] are used to low quality political leaders' china Singapore etc are proud of their high quality very
[2119.98 → 2127.10] capable genuinely helping the country leaders yeah it's okay though at the end it's in parentheses
[2127.10 → 2135.90] that's their mindset um you know so is North Korea that doesn't make it right and that doesn't make
[2135.90 → 2147.10] it is accurate it just it's something um right yeah um so anyway it's we could do a weird poll it's a bad
[2147.10 → 2154.30] it's a bad look it's a bad look for CD project red and while I recognize that the feedback may have
[2154.30 → 2162.86] actually been from gamers um I think some things are a bigger deal than what some gamers within a
[2162.86 → 2169.50] given demographic thinks should we see what the community thinks uh we can I I don't think it's
[2169.50 → 2176.86] going to be any kind of surprise yeah i don't even yeah I don't even I don't even think there's
[2176.86 → 2183.74] any point I think it's going to be 99 CD project red did the wrong thing and one percent uh people
[2183.74 → 2188.06] using a firewall right now okay I got a better one yeah we should ask the community what they
[2188.06 → 2194.70] what they think about CD project red now, or we can even maybe include a change like did you dislike
[2194.70 → 2199.98] them before, and you dislike them now did you dislike them before, and you like them now did you like them
[2199.98 → 2205.42] before, but you dislike them now did you like them before and do you still like them now i I don't even i
[2205.42 → 2214.54] I don't even understand the point of this poll like uh okay there here's your here's your poll that
[2214.54 → 2224.30] you insist on have been having okay your opinion of CD project red has improved or gotten worse all right
[2224.30 → 2230.62] are you happy create poll I just think it's interesting like with the release of
[2230.62 → 2234.86] cyberpunk and with these changes and stuff like has your mind share of CD project red changed i
[2234.86 → 2239.26] don't think it's interesting at all I think it's obvious but there you go all right I spammed it in
[2239.26 → 2243.82] the YouTube chat no, no you know what Luke no you can have your poll you can have your poll I'm
[2243.82 → 2248.70] putting it in the flow plane chat right now I'm hitting twitch with it there you go there's your poll Luke
[2248.70 → 2255.50] there's your poll if it's unchanged just don't answer the poll all right there you go here's your results
[2256.22 → 2265.58] uh display capture your opinion of CD project red has okay yeah basically gotten worse and a big
[2265.58 → 2272.70] surprise to nobody all right only other answer I saw coming up there yeah that's fair that's fair
[2274.78 → 2282.78] Microsoft is allegedly working on arm processors pretty big news right
[2282.78 → 2291.82] yeah uh this is also not in the doc but I just thought it was fascinating now this is
[2291.82 → 2298.54] supposed to be happening apparently or is rumoured to be happening um Bloomberg reported is it a rumour
[2298.54 → 2304.78] or is it real I'm not sure if we know they say it's happening is using arm limited designs to produce
[2304.78 → 2310.46] the process that will be used in its data centres yeah okay so it's apparently ah see they say this is
[2310.46 → 2319.26] happening but I don't know that this is actually uh confirmed you guys will have to let me know i
[2319.26 → 2324.62] don't actually have any notes because this is something I wanted to add solely because I wanted
[2324.62 → 2330.86] to make the joke that we're going to have to change it to micro hard if they actually make their own
[2330.86 → 2338.62] processors uh instead of Microsoft yeah and yeah my micro hard you know it's going to be uh it's exciting you
[2338.62 → 2344.70] know what I mean it's exciting for Microsoft micro hard excuse me to uh to take on apple directly
[2344.70 → 2350.94] this way, so the more solid reporting is that they're working on this for the data centre so this
[2350.94 → 2359.42] would be like a competitor for Amazon's graviton processors and then the more um wishy-washy report
[2359.42 → 2367.10] is that these could in the future end up in a direct competitor to the MacBook Air in the form of something like a
[2367.10 → 2374.30] surface product where Microsoft is trying to to to take on apple head to head with a deeper level
[2374.30 → 2381.74] of integration between the software and the hardware would be like micro firm you know soft it's soft and
[2381.74 → 2388.30] hard it does say here the chip the company's chip design unit responds to Jason zander head of
[2388.30 → 2393.98] the azure cloud business so yeah that would make sense it would be a lot more uh like data centre server
[2393.98 → 2401.82] focused yeah I'm excited I'm excited uh also excited about uh remembering to do sponsor spots
[2401.82 → 2408.38] right now before i just unexpectedly randomly uh suddenly have to duck out at about 6 30 because

[2549.98 → 2555.42] couple of other things we said we were going to talk about on the show uh do we want to go through the
[2555.42 → 2561.50] solar winds Orion software hacked I don't think we technically uh announced that in our four topics
[2561.50 → 2566.70] but we can oh no we don't have to do that then what did we talk about for our antitrust all right
[2566.70 → 2574.46] sure yeah what else is new hit me um 10 state attorneys general have accused uh google of illegally
[2574.46 → 2580.70] abusing its monopoly over uh essentially ad delivery online a lot of their points are based around
[2580.70 → 2585.26] uh the fact that google essentially owns like the whole pipeline like the whole ad buying process
[2585.26 → 2590.38] is owned by google that they've been buying up companies in the space uh doing a lot of antis
[2590.38 → 2596.86] competitive things uh in October the justice department and 11 states said google had illegally
[2596.86 → 2603.34] maintained a monopoly over online search engines and the ads that appear in users results and last week
[2603.34 → 2611.18] the FTC and 40 plus states accused Facebook of illegally crushing competition by acquiring younger rivals
[2611.18 → 2616.54] which has like been their entire business model for a while yep um and argued that the company should
[2616.54 → 2623.50] be broken up in 2007 this was actually huge google bought double click which offered advertising
[2623.50 → 2630.14] technology and acted as a marketplace in a deal that has since been criticized as central to google's
[2630.14 → 2638.14] dominance also freaking mostly yep um google now controls software at every stop of the ad sales process
[2638.14 → 2643.02] which is which is what I was talking about earlier um it's its it's interesting this is
[2643.02 → 2646.94] something I believe we've talked about on wan show quite a few times which is that like America
[2646.94 → 2652.38] hasn't really been using their antitrust laws in ways that they used to in the past or in ways that
[2652.94 → 2660.30] seem to be the way that they should be using them yeah it's interesting to see America kind of flexing
[2660.30 → 2670.54] those laws again um but yeah um interesting google claims it competes with a vast array of rivals so i
[2670.54 → 2676.94] guess yeah we'll, we'll see we'll see how this plays out I mean honestly I would love to see more antitrust
[2676.94 → 2686.22] uh honestly the entire fang is that how you pronounce it Facebook apple uh Amazon Netflix and google i I'd like
[2686.22 → 2692.78] to see all of them held to a higher standard than they have been over the last I'd say 10 to 15 years
[2693.98 → 2700.78] we'll see how it goes through well i the fang thing is definitely interesting to bring up it's
[2700.78 → 2705.82] i I think people mostly like that acronym because it sounds cool and I use it too because it is cool
[2707.02 → 2712.54] but it like leaves some things out that should probably be there, and it includes like Netflix which
[2712.54 → 2718.38] while they're awesome and gigantic they I don't think they necessarily represent the same types
[2718.38 → 2724.94] of actions as some of the other companies in there um, but that's fair yeah it's that's that's pretty
[2724.94 → 2733.10] fair if anything Netflix is a less advantaged player in their space yeah yeah I'm sure if they were more
[2733.10 → 2738.22] advantaged they would be doing the same things um the the two companies also known as google and
[2738.22 → 2746.22] Facebook accounted for 54 percent of us digital advertising in 2019 with Google share at 31 and
[2746.22 → 2753.50] Facebook's share at 23 that is massive freaking crazy we'll see if Facebook loses some of that share
[2753.50 → 2759.98] though apple is rolling out that update to iOS 14 that is going to make it much harder for Facebook to
[2759.98 → 2767.50] track users on iOS devices and basically the two are kind of sparring right now with Facebook saying this
[2767.50 → 2773.34] is a bad thing this is going to affect and this is going to affect advertisers ability to get better
[2773.34 → 2779.98] better CPMs and more relevant ads to your face holes and apple says well people are more than welcome to
[2779.98 → 2789.26] have the most relevant ads to their face holes they just have to opt into it now so yeah I'm with apple on
[2789.26 → 2798.54] this one personally I mean it's also great for me because all of our digital advertising is around you
[2798.54 → 2805.66] know uh building an audience that we kind of know what you guys are into and then talking to you directly
[2805.66 → 2812.06] about that stuff instead of doing it in like a scummy you know listening to your microphone on your phone
[2812.06 → 2819.82] way um so yeah i I love it if we could have a return to people just watching the content that they
[2819.82 → 2827.74] watch and getting served you know ads or sponsors or whatever that's relevant to that it seems like
[2827.74 → 2835.90] a good step backwards to me and I think that's pretty much it oh yeah speaking of which lttstore.com
[2835.90 → 2841.26] we've actually got nothing to really call out this week other than to say thank you guys very much for
[2841.26 → 2849.90] your support we sold through almost all 17 000 mouse pads that we ordered I thought 17 000 mouse pads was
[2849.90 → 2855.74] a lot I thought it was crazy there are only a couple of sizes left so if you guys want to get one they're
[2855.74 → 2863.18] there but not for long um we have more coming but probably not until late February to mid-March
[2863.18 → 2867.66] yeah sometime in that time frame the good news though is that stealth hottie stealth hotties stealth
[2867.66 → 2872.46] hoodies are restocked water bottles are restocked in all colours, and we have a bunch of graphic keys
[2872.46 → 2878.06] back in stock we've still got lots of toques uh we've still got lots of CPU pillows and tons of board
[2878.06 → 2884.62] books I wish we had user reviews for the board books because uh all the feedback I've seen about
[2884.62 → 2889.66] it so far has been incredible I just wish there was another place where I could just go sit and get my
[2889.66 → 2894.22] ego boost from reading people's comments on the board book I've even had people sending me pictures
[2894.22 → 2901.26] uh like tagging me on Twitter with like them reading it to their baby and stuff as just as someone for
[2901.26 → 2907.82] whom child literacy is such a big deal it's just heartwarming for me to see people just it doesn't
[2907.82 → 2912.94] matter what it's about like that's the biggest lesson when it comes to when it comes to child literacy
[2912.94 → 2921.90] it doesn't matter what your kids reading just make sure they're reading if it's like a Pokémon uh
[2922.62 → 2927.90] what's that stupid Pokémon book that uh our eldest used to just sit and read for hours on end
[2929.50 → 2934.78] I don't I don't remember it was like basically like a creaturepedia of like Pokémon it's like it's
[2934.78 → 2940.46] not it's not this is not intellectual reading material by any stretch of the imagination but for me
[2940.46 → 2946.22] it was just exciting to see him with his nose buried in a book for hours on end because that's
[2946.22 → 2950.94] the building block that's foundational yeah they can go somewhere from there pretty easily at least
[2950.94 → 2957.42] they're learning the process of reading and whatnot exactly, exactly so it's really exciting to me honestly
[2957.42 → 2965.42] I've had people both internally and externally ask me you know like when's the when's the ABCs of
[2965.42 → 2970.70] computers you know like because we already did ABCs of gaming and I'm kind of looking for a new
[2970.70 → 2975.98] challenge I wouldn't mind doing something that's more like story driven but I haven't I haven't really
[2975.98 → 2981.42] I haven't really decided yet so you could choose your own adventure game and choose your book sorry no
[2982.22 → 2990.38] not like that um something more like uh like with actual characters, and you know like the computer
[2990.38 → 2996.86] family or something gamer family I don't like I don't know what it would be but where it has
[2996.86 → 3003.50] you know life lessons but sort of more related to gaming and technology um you know how like you know
[3003.50 → 3009.18] Bernstein bears will have like a fun like it tells a story, but there 's's always like a lesson you
[3009.18 → 3015.42] know like be don't judge people based on their appearances so you can even have a lesson that's just like
[3016.14 → 3022.14] don't pre-order things obviously you'd want to frame it more no I'm serious though you'd want to frame it
[3023.10 → 3029.26] yeah you'd want to frame it more in like a kid sort of friendly way like um you know you could
[3029.26 → 3034.06] have a lesson about you could have a lesson about like loot boxes as well so they could go and they
[3034.06 → 3039.50] could learn that if they waste all their allowance money on this they're going to end up disappointed when
[3039.50 → 3045.74] what they could have done is they could have just bought something that made them that they knew was
[3045.74 → 3050.22] going to make them happy in the first place instead of gambling like so having like anti-gambling
[3050.22 → 3058.14] messaging um just like sort of pro-consumer jealousy too because like if they got too jealous and wanted
[3058.14 → 3063.26] to buy some cosmetic box in a game they don't even get the thing that they wanted, and then they can't
[3063.26 → 3066.86] play with their friends because their friends are all playing this other game, but they can't afford to buy
[3066.86 → 3073.02] it exactly, exactly that's cool yeah so that'd be pretty neat um I've got like two soup I've got
