[0.00 --> 5.84]  all right we're almost live give it a sec it's just uh it's it's doing things
[5.84 --> 9.60]  yeah it's trying it's going full effort
[9.60 --> 21.00]  oh what is that even happening right now uh-oh i'm flying blind i'm flying blind boys
[21.00 --> 29.82]  and we're live welcome to the land show merry ho ho ho day everyone it's christmas
[29.82 --> 37.14]  but that will not stop me or luke from coming to you live from canada canada north america
[37.14 --> 41.82]  yep that's where we're from all right we've got all kinds of great topics for you today
[41.82 --> 48.04]  which is wow it's a good thing that santa already visited this morning because i've got a whole
[48.04 --> 55.68]  year left to make up for that whopper no one's been in the office this week so um we didn't even have
[55.68 --> 61.16]  real tech linked so i couldn't even just go back to riley's tech linked notes and steal topics and
[61.16 --> 69.66]  and talking points so luke and i literally you know this is the most classic when show we've done
[69.66 --> 77.88]  in probably years yeah because you and i actually did the doc yeah luke and i actually did the doc
[77.88 --> 84.24]  for the wan show and i say that really loosely because luke did like jack at all i did a topic
[84.24 --> 90.44]  i did one topic luke and i did the talk for the wan show for the first time in probably years
[90.44 --> 95.58]  because everyone was out of the office all week so uh here we go ladies and gentlemen
[95.58 --> 104.78]  we've got the kfc gaming console ripped off our idea which is especially stupid because it's not even
[104.78 --> 114.62]  a good idea i made stencils with my 3d printer so we're gonna do some story time about that
[114.62 --> 124.44]  what do you got luke 60 12 gig and 3080 ti 20 gig are coming and uh tesla is offering fsd
[124.44 --> 129.92]  subscription service because we all knew they would of course they would let's go ahead and roll
[129.92 --> 135.94]  that intro we both have like christmas dinners to get to so we're gonna have to go ahead and uh
[135.94 --> 140.04]  we're gonna have to get through the show we're gonna have to get through the show today there you
[140.04 --> 143.40]  go there's that intro i gotta close the door my daughter just ran in here
[143.40 --> 152.32]  like what even is the purpose of closed doors at a certain point you know someone got banned off
[152.32 --> 158.54]  twitch because they they left the room to like grab a snack or something and their child walked
[158.54 --> 165.20]  into the room um clothes and everything oh really unattended children are not allowed on stream so
[165.20 --> 172.04]  they got a full full ban for it what like forever as far as i know yeah but i could be very wrong about
[172.04 --> 177.42]  that point surely they were just like some nobody i'm trying to remember like one of the twi i need i need
[177.42 --> 184.82]  an ltt store toke this is terrible this is getting worse yeah yeah that'd be nice yeah i'm trying to
[184.82 --> 190.30]  think of one of the like twitch streamers that notoriously can't get banned for anything in spite of
[190.30 --> 198.28]  like being mean to animals i i i i i'm so sorry you know the funniest thing is that because i tend to pay
[198.28 --> 207.04]  attention to internet entertainment news my google feed is often full of articles about uh you know
[207.04 --> 215.08]  dr disrespect pokimane and all i probably like said that wrong uh doctor like okay awesome all these like
[215.08 --> 222.90]  uh twitch personalities and other than the top like you know i'm trying to think like how many i i could
[222.90 --> 228.60]  actually name off the top of my head i could probably yeah i could probably name like six
[228.60 --> 234.22]  of which the only reason i remember like half of them is because i've met them at some point or another
[234.22 --> 242.76]  and like they seemed pretty cool um but uh yeah i i don't know i just i'm always reading it it seems
[242.76 --> 249.70]  like the single most dramatic community of all time like there's yeah there's one guy releasing like
[249.70 --> 256.44]  all these like sexed messages and like hey we had a relationship and then and then there's this
[256.44 --> 261.96]  other one that's like uh no actually we didn't the context wasn't there and then other people are like
[261.96 --> 267.64]  actually there was i i don't i don't even know i can't even keep track of it it's just like wow i
[267.64 --> 273.14]  thought i thought you're supposed i thought you played video games i thought that was what you did
[273.14 --> 279.42]  i think one of the things is because twitch i i i'm sure a lot of it is real but i think one of the
[279.42 --> 284.24]  things is because twitch is so bad for discoverability um they have the same type of thing
[284.24 --> 289.12]  that youtube does where they make drama between each other and that promotes each other's channels
[289.12 --> 297.82]  and gets them actually going um but uh yeah i i think there's a little bit more real drama on twitch
[297.82 --> 303.36]  for one and i think the fake drama is a little bit more intense i would i would say that one moment
[303.36 --> 308.58]  please the the yeah hey guys i'm closing the door for a reason please stop opening it
[308.58 --> 317.58]  crying out loud the chat has informed me by the way that the the lady that got banned for her child
[317.58 --> 323.06]  being alone on her stream uh was unbanned you're doing it with her outrage you're doing it okay
[323.06 --> 327.80]  this is fixing my this wasn't no this was a whole this was a whole drama thing last week
[327.80 --> 335.20]  okay guys i even sent i even sent this to luke okay this this is how it went down last week see
[335.20 --> 341.40]  this is my face this is my face when the chin when the chin is behind the banner okay i fixed it i moved
[341.40 --> 348.16]  the banner down then we got isn't there gonna be the the swear word then we got this freaking guy i
[348.16 --> 353.46]  don't know is that does that matter are you not allowed to swear on twitch in a picture i don't know
[353.46 --> 359.24]  hold on a second where's my where's my stupid thing there we go look at this look at this he
[359.24 --> 366.32]  can't stop ladies and gentlemen he cannot stop he cannot not do it that's fine that that was it i
[366.32 --> 369.84]  was just i was waiting for my opportunity you sure did not make me wait long
[369.84 --> 375.08]  i was temporary i was fixing my sweater come on
[375.08 --> 378.60]  all right why don't we jump into our first topic temporary
[378.60 --> 387.32]  yes is my outrage at the kfc gaming console me too right okay so let's let's have a look at this
[387.32 --> 392.54]  thing let's have a look at this thing okay luke i know that this is very unusual but i'm gonna do
[392.54 --> 397.06]  all the talking and i'd like you to say nothing for a little bit here okay okay okay hold on a
[397.06 --> 405.68]  second hold on here it is introducing the chocolate kfc console and the hot dog flavored warming drawer
[405.68 --> 413.00]  okay no for serious though this is the kfc console power your hunger forged in the fires of the kfc ovens
[413.00 --> 418.44]  believable i mean who could ever think of something like this it's it's complete and utter madness hold
[418.44 --> 423.74]  on a second though i'm not done i'm not done yet okay hold on hold on built and designed by cooler
[423.74 --> 429.12]  master it's the opposite of cooling by the way it's a chicken warming drawer with only the best
[429.12 --> 439.06]  nook 9 extreme compute element oh yeah and i don't know a graphics card um asus powered graphics
[439.06 --> 447.16]  that runs buttery smooth asus asus asus uh we don't okay we don't know exactly what what that is but
[447.16 --> 453.72]  that's okay because you got down everywhere you got fire cuda uh we should be no we should be back up
[453.72 --> 458.50]  yep yep should be back up okay we don't know exactly it's kind of fluttering that is but that's
[458.50 --> 464.16]  a temporary temporary issue hopefully all right so back to the kfc console because this is very
[464.16 --> 469.94]  important we need to not get distracted here vr ready ray tracing which means it's got to be at
[469.94 --> 477.40]  least an rtx 2060 i guess oh maybe it's like a not announced yet thing no no hold on luke hold on luke
[477.40 --> 484.22]  we're getting to it we're getting to it okay 4k tv gaming 240 fps with up to 240 hertz output and you
[484.22 --> 489.92]  gotta power your hunger okay kfc gaming cooler master asus and seagate oh yeah also you know
[489.92 --> 494.82]  cooler master again because they like made the case or whatever all right so luke let me ask you
[494.82 --> 501.20]  something let me ask you an honest question very honest question here does that remind you of anything
[501.20 --> 507.64]  i i feel like you guys should do it i think you guys should one-up them
[507.64 --> 514.90]  just just hold on a second the luke i i have to know honestly does that remind you of anything
[514.90 --> 523.06]  yes okay you gotta tell me yeah the the pizza heater they they they did an internal warming chamber
[523.06 --> 531.06]  uh versus the like just top mounted thing that i did um that's probably cool i guess
[531.06 --> 538.84]  i just i can't believe they might be doing it um it doesn't i mean there definitely is not enough
[538.84 --> 544.54]  information to make me think that it's like for sure happening there's no way to pre-order it uh
[544.54 --> 550.12]  yeah there's there's literally no offboarding links at all other than just the landing page
[550.12 --> 556.54]  so i have no idea it would be a weird it would be quite the outseason april fool's joke
[556.54 --> 565.70]  um but it also looks extremely achievable yeah because they're doing nothing exactly kfc has
[565.70 --> 572.26]  nothing to do with this at all kfc has memed it up and you can't underestimate don't undersell the
[572.26 --> 579.40]  importance of memeing it up because honestly speaking i mean it's hilarious because if they
[579.40 --> 585.16]  actually go through with this which it looks like they will like in the in the early days of this
[585.16 --> 593.18]  meme nonsense i don't believe it was real i think what happened was kfc it worked too well kfc
[593.18 --> 601.46]  actually memed something into existence okay i suspect they got approached by intel because
[601.46 --> 607.32]  otherwise there's no other reason on god's green earth that you would use a nook at computer extreme
[607.32 --> 615.90]  element for anything that you're designing a case around because it's it's small but other than that
[615.90 --> 621.94]  it's like very expensive for the performance that you're getting extremely like this this thing is
[621.94 --> 628.70]  going to be very costly yeah we've got rocket lake rocket lake cpus around the corner which presumably
[628.70 --> 634.06]  this thing will not be using no i could be wrong maybe there'll be rocket lake they're probably canon
[634.06 --> 642.56]  like it's it's specifically spec'd out as a nuk 9 exactly exactly probably not so intel approached
[642.56 --> 648.28]  a kfc that's what i think happened brought in cooler master because intel partners with cooler master
[648.28 --> 654.38]  and all kinds of crazy stuff whether it's you know production of uh like their their uh their
[654.38 --> 659.78]  sub-zero thermoelectric peltier cooler thing or whatever else they work with cooler master and all
[659.78 --> 664.68]  kinds of stuff they approached cooler master they were like hey you guys make cases hey we make this
[664.68 --> 671.30]  weird thing that needs to fit in a case oh by the way uh the exhaust heat needs to keep your chicken
[671.30 --> 678.94]  warm and we watched this video on linus tech tips a number of years back that gave us the perfect idea
[678.94 --> 686.34]  for how to do this totally to the prototype build totally original idea okay one one mr luke lafreniere
[686.34 --> 694.24]  here with one of the worst like dislike ratio videos to ever be uploaded on the channel right up there
[694.24 --> 699.60]  with how to hide your and uh what what are some of the other balls that actually looks like the
[699.60 --> 704.62]  like dislike has improved over time i think it probably has i think it was i think it was worse
[704.62 --> 710.30]  than that i think it was worse than that it was a lot closer to like one to one at one point okay can
[710.30 --> 716.60]  you talk us through what exactly we're looking at here mr lafreniere like uh this was this was a
[716.60 --> 725.78]  budget of of nothing other than buying a pizza um and uh like i think it was a side panel that i
[725.78 --> 733.68]  pulled from an old scrapyard wars computer plus a test test bench um and some cardboard and we made a
[733.68 --> 740.80]  a panel that would actually like keep warm uh maybe it shouldn't yeah pizza warming i think it
[740.80 --> 744.68]  originally was called a pizza heating thing and people got upset about that we so we called it
[744.68 --> 752.82]  warming um but it actually did succeed in keeping the pizza at least somewhat warm well okay you're
[752.82 --> 758.08]  forgetting a critical part of the story and the thing that i was so mad about because okay so this
[758.08 --> 764.08]  video actually generated a little bit of tension between me and luke because i thought i was throwing
[764.08 --> 771.28]  him a total softball on a friday afternoon to like hit his video quota for the week okay and i thought i
[771.28 --> 775.76]  was like doing him a solid because this was something that i had planned to just kind of
[776.40 --> 782.36]  shard out in an afternoon uh because i was just like yeah it's so funny you've got like this heat from
[782.36 --> 787.94]  the computer why not do something useful with it uh oh yeah you could keep your pizza warm
[787.94 --> 796.18]  so luke goes and just totally i don't know what happened i don't know how this miscommunication
[796.18 --> 801.14]  took place but luke hears or maybe i didn't say it i don't know i'm not pointing fingers
[801.86 --> 811.46]  just the concept was pizza uh like temperature maintenance mechanism and luke manages to turn it into
[811.46 --> 816.50]  pizza like heating so he gets the he orders the pizza in the morning
[817.14 --> 823.78]  and then tries to reheat it with the computer and i was like no luke that's why i asked you to order
[823.78 --> 830.66]  two pizzas so you would put one of them on the computer and you would put one of them on the
[830.66 --> 838.34]  counter and see which one cooled down slower which it would have worked for way better it's not supposed
[838.34 --> 845.86]  to be an oven this is not easy bake afternoon this is this is a different kind of baked afternoon if
[845.86 --> 851.54]  you really think that we're gonna heat the pizza with the freaking computer someone in flow plane chat
[851.54 --> 858.18]  was like this is why luke doesn't work for lmg anymore you know what maybe maybe um oh yeah i don't know
[858.18 --> 863.54]  it i there there was these like additional concepts we came up with too of course we got signed out of
[863.54 --> 867.46]  the dock come on of course um there's these additional concepts we came up with too i don't
[867.46 --> 874.74]  know if you remember this but we were theorizing using like um uh like hair dryer coils do you remember
[874.74 --> 884.74]  that yes i do yeah i do we wanted it to like like be real warm yeah um and like there yeah we we had
[884.74 --> 890.58]  actually taken the concept pretty far but to do it genuinely properly which it does not look like
[890.58 --> 896.26]  they're doing to be clear um but to do it genuinely properly it would take it would take a little bit but
[896.26 --> 901.46]  it's definitely possible now i've ripped on luke a fair bit here on this topic here but can i just
[901.46 --> 908.58]  play can i play luke's advocate for a second here and talk about how long i actually gave luke to
[909.78 --> 917.46]  put together his concept for this and execute it um so based on that it was shot on a friday that means
[917.46 --> 923.46]  we had wan show uh i know that he didn't start it until the afternoon because i remember freaking out
[923.46 --> 930.50]  because the pizza was there like around lunch time and i was like why is the pizza here already and
[930.50 --> 935.94]  luke's like well it's lunch time i kind of assumed we'd like eat the pizza after we warm it up or
[935.94 --> 942.74]  something and i'm like okay that's very frugal and uh efficient of you okay good job but also
[943.94 --> 949.06]  you haven't actually built the computer yet you know what it doesn't matter okay we operated under much
[949.06 --> 955.38]  much tighter fiscal constraints back then so i think luke actually even offered to reorder pizza
[955.38 --> 960.42]  for like what i had intended the concept to be which was maintaining the temperature but i was like
[960.42 --> 968.26]  what would that be another 50 no we better not do that so i gave luke like minutes of notice on this
[968.26 --> 974.82]  and then like two hours to fully build this concept and and shoot a video about it
[974.82 --> 981.86]  so in fairness i still probably could have done a bit better i i think if it was if it was more of
[981.86 --> 987.94]  a keep warm concept i think it probably would have had less negative backlash but um yeah i always kind
[987.94 --> 994.82]  of wanted to do a follow-up but it was i mean it was one of the most hated videos ever it was one of
[994.82 --> 999.54]  the most hated videos ever i still think that might actually be a good idea to do a follow-up on because
[999.54 --> 1007.22]  like you could title it like our most hated video ever part two and people would be all over that
[1007.22 --> 1013.78]  um but i i just it back when it was just linus and i like there isn't there was very rarely enough time
[1013.78 --> 1019.94]  to do like big grandiose projects and to do that properly it would have been a big grandiose project
[1019.94 --> 1026.74]  it would have actually taken some work and neither luke nor i has a ton of how do we say metal fabrication
[1026.74 --> 1033.70]  know-how you know you don't like you don't like my cuts in the side panel what are you talking about
[1034.34 --> 1038.42]  you know what luke they're beautiful you know i'm gonna be honest with you we actually have a part
[1038.42 --> 1044.34]  two of this concept planned that i think is has like viral potential instead of trying to do anything
[1044.34 --> 1051.22]  with food though now that kfc has beaten that horse to death um we are actually going to build a
[1051.22 --> 1059.54]  water-cooled machine that has a passive passively cooled radiator that is a cat bed oh
[1061.94 --> 1065.54]  oh that's smart because everyone complains about them walking on your keyboard but it's probably
[1065.54 --> 1071.06]  because your keyboard's warm and they also just like to be they like to be in the middle of whatever
[1071.06 --> 1077.14]  you're doing like they always stuff laundry or like draw on bed warm bed might distract them so we're
[1077.14 --> 1084.02]  gonna do the cat warming pc uh stay tuned for that one it's gonna be awesome and we've got enough
[1084.02 --> 1088.50]  people at the office that own cats now that it's gonna be one of those things where we can actually
[1088.50 --> 1095.22]  test it in like a variety of uh a variety of uh people's homes and see if it actually works i suspect
[1095.22 --> 1100.10]  my cat's gonna be super into it but it's kind of cheating because dash will literally go sit on
[1100.66 --> 1106.98]  any new thing that is in any room of our house i i brought out a couple of garbage bags to uh to
[1106.98 --> 1112.82]  sort cardboard and then like plastic waste from opening christmas presents this morning she immediately
[1112.82 --> 1120.10]  went into one of them and then went into the other one and came out and was like okay they're safe i have
[1120.10 --> 1125.62]  i've inspected yeah the family the family can rest assured that these garbage bags are fully prepared
[1125.62 --> 1134.10]  for their garbage thank you dash that's fantastic um oh we've got a question from john mcbane mcbane
[1136.58 --> 1143.70]  uh i've been re-watching early uh early seasons of the simpsons and it's like i never realized as a
[1143.70 --> 1150.02]  kid how political the show is it's like ronald reagan is in there constantly and stuff like that
[1150.02 --> 1155.86]  and only as an adult just like when i was a kid i just didn't really place the connection especially
[1155.86 --> 1160.82]  because it was american politics stuff yeah um so i just thought they were just characters you know
[1160.82 --> 1165.22]  like i didn't i didn't really necessarily clue in that they were they were depictions of real people
[1165.78 --> 1172.50]  um john mcbane asks why no when show vaud on flow plane uh wrecked
[1172.50 --> 1182.98]  uh wrecked because reasons it's been a low priority basically yeah yeah all right cool moving on to
[1182.98 --> 1188.58]  oh yeah what else is there to say about kfc ripping off our idea oh yeah we do have the spec it's a core
[1188.58 --> 1199.46]  i9 99 adhk it's not even 10th gen no look nine oh yeah nook9 just means core i9 based though i think
[1199.46 --> 1206.26]  i don't think nook9 means ninth gen i i don't know okay i'm not sure yeah um it it we don't you
[1206.26 --> 1211.54]  don't know how much like ram memory it's actually going to come with because the uh compute element
[1211.54 --> 1219.54]  is not populated with memory and the kfc spec page says nothing uh the graphics card has no details it
[1219.54 --> 1225.30]  just says it's from asus there's nothing else at all no no it also says it's buttery smooth
[1225.30 --> 1230.42]  and up to 240 fps in all games
[1234.18 --> 1240.26]  i love how they capitalize all games is this one of those things where like the marketing for it is so
[1240.26 --> 1246.98]  blatantly bull spit that you know if someone comes back and says hey this is false advertising kfc can
[1246.98 --> 1252.10]  actually with a straight face say well you couldn't have possibly believed this was real so it's kind of on
[1252.10 --> 1258.98]  you because i think that's a thing isn't it i think so like uh well because red bull but you know
[1258.98 --> 1265.22]  red bull had to pull their red bull gives you wings ah so maybe it's not maybe it doesn't matter how
[1265.22 --> 1272.18]  obvious it is that it's not true i don't know some uh some brands have gotten away with that so i i don't
[1272.18 --> 1278.66]  know um probably up to i have no idea how that works yeah i'm not not a clue hardly a legal expert
[1278.66 --> 1282.90]  can you believe over 10 000 people are watching this on christmas don't you people have anything
[1282.90 --> 1291.46]  better to do meanwhile i'm here too uh let's get let's move on to our next topic wow okay what's
[1291.46 --> 1299.78]  going on okay so for the longest time um i have actually strung my own rackets and it's one of those
[1299.78 --> 1308.74]  things that like doesn't make a ton of sense um i spent like i don't know some ungodly amount of
[1308.74 --> 1314.42]  money on a stringing machine because i was like nah dog i don't want like the little like manual one i
[1314.42 --> 1320.42]  want like the electronic one and i'm gonna i'm gonna like string my rackets all the time and i'm gonna do
[1320.42 --> 1326.34]  it so often that it's gonna pay for itself and i'll even like i'll do it for like buddies and i'll charge
[1326.34 --> 1331.38]  than 10 bucks or whatever and like come on get real anyway the point is i spent like thousands
[1331.38 --> 1340.98]  of dollars on a racket string machine that i have probably used a hundred times maybe at a grand
[1340.98 --> 1347.78]  total savings of about 12 to 13 dollars a pop that's that's about how much money i save doing it myself but
[1348.50 --> 1355.22]  one of the benefits of doing it myself is that instead of having like the brand logo you know
[1355.22 --> 1362.34]  yonix or leaning or whatever uh put onto the strings with like the the marker i can print my
[1362.34 --> 1367.46]  own stencils and get my own marker ink and then i can put whatever i want so lots of people have
[1367.46 --> 1375.22]  like super cool things that they stencil onto their rackets like angry pandas or or whatever um so i
[1376.18 --> 1382.50]  got it in my head that i was like oh i have an ultimaker 2 extended that sits in my side room that
[1382.50 --> 1389.70]  i almost never use except to print random toys off thingiverse for my kids i am going to make my own
[1389.70 --> 1396.98]  racket stencils so here's my first attempt i let my daughter pick which one she wanted i actually
[1397.62 --> 1401.70]  i really should have probably grabbed her racket to show you guys the end result that would have been
[1401.70 --> 1406.66]  a sensible thing to do whatever the point is it put black ink on the strings it worked um and she
[1406.66 --> 1410.50]  decided she wanted a four-leaf clover that's what that is if that's what you're trying to figure out right
[1410.50 --> 1420.50]  now no is is that paper uh no it's filament okay yeah okay yeah so anyway um i am not a 3d printing
[1420.50 --> 1427.22]  expert i have people like jake and colin and alex to do that for me so usually when i want something
[1427.22 --> 1434.10]  3d printed i'm like hey one of you can you design a thing and print it for me or matias there's there's
[1434.10 --> 1439.14]  literally a half a dozen people on staff that can just kind of conjure anything i could possibly need
[1439.14 --> 1445.70]  and 3d print it for me so i've gone full ceo mode on 3d printing and gone you know what it's actually
[1445.70 --> 1450.26]  cheaper for me to hire someone to do this for me than it is for me to learn to do it myself sure so
[1450.26 --> 1456.26]  this is one of the first times that i have ever actually tried to create something from scratch
[1456.26 --> 1464.18]  to 3d print so i found this software called matter control 2.0 and it specifically has a function
[1464.18 --> 1471.78]  called what is it called image converter so you can just find any image you want and it will convert
[1471.78 --> 1478.66]  it into a 3d model and then all you have to do is adjust the depth which um the guide that i found
[1478.66 --> 1483.70]  said that it the field was in millimeters turns out they have since updated the software it is now in
[1483.70 --> 1490.10]  centimeters that was a close call uh we almost printed a one centimeter thick stencil uh with completely
[1490.10 --> 1496.82]  solid fill because i didn't want it to you know do anything other than complete fill because so that
[1496.82 --> 1503.30]  would have been like a pound of filament or whatever at this size um anyway so they've converted that to
[1503.30 --> 1509.86]  centimeters we got that one figured out but the real problem for me was not that i'm a moron as far as
[1509.86 --> 1516.82]  3d printing goes but actually that i'm a photoshop moron so it has a function where you're supposed to just
[1516.82 --> 1520.18]  bring in any black and white image this did not start out black and white by the way it started
[1520.18 --> 1526.58]  out green so i had to do a whole thing in paint.net where you convert to black and white with like some
[1526.58 --> 1532.26]  tolerance or whatever regular paint wouldn't do it don't you hate that when something looks solid
[1532.26 --> 1538.34]  like a solid color and you get the paint bucket and it fills in like 30 of it oh no that was an ever
[1538.34 --> 1543.30]  so ever slightly different shade of green so i had to figure out how to do that in paint.net
[1543.30 --> 1549.30]  then i ran into the real problem because all that stuff that i've like either pretty much done before
[1549.30 --> 1558.74]  or was very straightforward in paint.net okay i had this let me just bring up my thing here okay in
[1558.74 --> 1566.66]  paint.net i had this and you would think that this isn't a problem so this right here is a transparency
[1566.66 --> 1573.14]  layer because i didn't want the stencil to be a rectangle right why would i want to print out
[1573.14 --> 1579.30]  a whole bunch more filament here if the racket head is an oval and my graphic is an oval shape
[1580.42 --> 1588.58]  i could not for the love of all that is good figure out how to get rid of it so in paint.net if i
[1588.58 --> 1596.58]  save as png theoretically this image you would think would be an oval shaped image it's not no and when
[1596.58 --> 1602.66]  you search for how to get rid of checkerboard background you end up it's one of those things
[1602.66 --> 1608.58]  where google is too good at knowing what the problem probably is and doesn't give you anything but the
[1608.58 --> 1614.98]  most obvious answer so every single help thread i found was people who don't understand what a
[1614.98 --> 1620.74]  transparency layer is and they were trying to get rid of it because they thought it was part of their
[1620.74 --> 1628.58]  image and i was like no i want an oval shaped canvas that's what i actually want and as far as i could
[1628.58 --> 1636.90]  tell there was no way to do it so my workaround ended up being to invert the colors i think what i
[1636.90 --> 1644.66]  ended up doing was making that actually black and then in like double inverting or rather not inverting
[1644.66 --> 1652.42]  the colors in matter control 2.0 so that this outer rectangle which i never did get rid of was just
[1653.06 --> 1660.66]  this it was blank so that is my long and boring story about 3d printing stencils and after all this
[1660.66 --> 1665.38]  frustration i'm finally printing the thing and my wife walks in and she goes why didn't you just do
[1665.38 --> 1673.06]  that on the cry cut is that is that an acrylic cutter it's it's like kind of an everything cutter it's
[1673.06 --> 1681.38]  like a little like it's like a little cnc cutter thing for like uh like craft clubs like it's all
[1681.38 --> 1687.46]  i was thinking about actually the perfect tool and i i had i had seen the spoiler of of ivan walking in
[1687.46 --> 1691.46]  and asking why he didn't just use the cry cut but all i was thinking of that whole time is like man
[1691.46 --> 1699.06]  there must have been like a plethora of ways to do this better like a way better tool for this job yeah
[1699.06 --> 1706.66]  yeah like using a 3d printer for this is wild and the thing about the cry cut too is that it comes
[1706.66 --> 1714.42]  with like housewife grade software like it's like like kid friendly software so it's it really is
[1714.42 --> 1721.38]  designed to make it so that just about anyone can steal an image on google image search and turn it
[1721.38 --> 1726.50]  into anything they want and meanwhile i'm figuring out how to 3d print it but you know what luke you
[1726.50 --> 1737.06]  you know what no no you because this is so durable okay this is made of high quality pla filament okay
[1737.62 --> 1742.66]  and i might have printed it the wrong size but darn it it's gonna last forever
[1746.90 --> 1754.74]  nice so the point of the story is guys hit me up on twitter at actually don't use the handle that's
[1754.74 --> 1760.58]  on this thing use that linus g sebastian and i want you guys to send me what i should put on my racket
[1760.58 --> 1766.98]  because after all of this i i put the four leaf clover on my daughter's racket and it worked great
[1766.98 --> 1773.06]  it worked exactly as i would have expected it to uh but i could not decide what to put on mine so guys
[1773.86 --> 1781.14]  help me out here help me out brah that sexist not gonna lie okay you're right you're right the cry cut
[1781.14 --> 1789.06]  in its hold on a second what is the what is the color scheme of this thing the cry cut machine in
[1789.06 --> 1797.14]  its soft baby blue color scheme is definitely marketed to manly men i'm sorry i did i did it wrong i i said
[1797.14 --> 1803.94]  a bad i said a bad wrong think wrong speak thing house person house person it could have been any kind
[1803.94 --> 1807.94]  of house person any kind of house person okay
[1810.98 --> 1815.86]  nick nick's messaging me already look nick you gotta stop pinging the entire chat with
[1815.86 --> 1824.50]  teams messages i'm i'm muting your notifications see you later um okay the reason i called it that is
[1824.50 --> 1831.94]  because that's the only person in this house who uses it okay and only only when she's not at work and not busy
[1831.94 --> 1843.06]  so there you go um all right what else do we have uh we've got ooh sponsors the show is brought to you
[1843.06 --> 1849.78]  today by oh lordy i do not have sponsor talking points okay i guess we're making it up as we go
[1850.50 --> 1860.90]  haha because we no longer archive previous when show talking points private internet access it's a vpn
[1860.90 --> 1869.78]  it helps you let luke know that his chin is cut off by the lower third again and also pia is good for
[1869.78 --> 1878.90]  keeping your ip your ip private so you can ip privately um so no one's watching it's part of your
[1878.90 --> 1886.02]  internet security toolkit and you can try it you can i i forget if they have a free trial or if it's a paid
[1886.02 --> 1894.90]  trial but you can definitely get some kind of trial lmg.gg slash pia when i hope that's the right vanity url
[1894.90 --> 1901.14]  cool go check it out show is also brought to you by ridge wallet ah yes this one i'm this one i'm pretty good with
[1901.14 --> 1908.26]  okay ridge wallet save 10 at ridge wallet whatever their website is uh if you google ridge wallet you'll definitely
[1908.82 --> 1913.70]  land there and you use offer code linus and they have more than just ridge wallets and and ridge
[1913.70 --> 1919.30]  wallets are little wallets that are these two plates and they're held together by like elastic bands and
[1919.30 --> 1925.14]  you can kind of you can put your finger into the little finger hole and it's like and it lets all your
[1925.14 --> 1929.54]  cards out and you kind of pick through them and get the one that you want and it's like it's small it
[1929.54 --> 1935.38]  doesn't hold a lot of cards but it does hold cash because it has a money clip on the side that initially
[1935.38 --> 1939.22]  when i first started doing these spots for them i thought was so that you could put the ridge wallet
[1939.22 --> 1944.10]  on your belt but that's not what it's for jake called me an idiot and i remembered that forever
[1944.10 --> 1950.10]  thank you jake uh but that's okay they have more than just wallets they got other stuff so go check
[1950.10 --> 1961.62]  them out ridge wallet we got a link down below all right in other news lol told you so tesla has officially
[1961.62 --> 1967.62]  well i don't know i don't know is does it count as a tesla announcement when elon tweets it at this
[1967.62 --> 1975.22]  point i feel like legally no right but probably yes if that makes any sense um i think he's like
[1975.22 --> 1980.02]  not allowed anymore i don't remember um i know there was there was something going on with him
[1980.02 --> 1984.18]  and his tweets and what they were allowed to be and what they weren't allowed to be a while ago i don't
[1984.18 --> 1989.38]  remember what the ending of all that was uh but he has said early next year which at this point could
[1989.38 --> 1997.38]  be like days from now um there will be fully self-driving uh subscription services available
[1997.38 --> 2004.58]  instead of one large purchase so if you like lease your car uh you could subscribe to it instead of buy
[2004.58 --> 2012.58]  it um also apparently the pricing just went up by two thousand dollars yeah wow i mean you know it's one
[2012.58 --> 2020.90]  of those things where i get it i understand why full self-driving is expensive uh because there's a
[2020.90 --> 2027.30]  ton of software development and it's ongoing it's not like you can you know this isn't final fantasy
[2027.30 --> 2034.34]  two you can't just you know well no my point is you can't just like write it once yeah yeah ship it and
[2034.34 --> 2041.30]  forget about it there's going to constantly be new edge cases that you're going to discover that like the just
[2041.30 --> 2048.98]  the the data processing and data storage that you're going to have to maintain on an ongoing
[2048.98 --> 2055.30]  basis in order to keep learning and keep improving and keep remapping the world because the world is
[2055.30 --> 2063.22]  it's so inconvenient the world is always changing right i understand why you have to pay a mess ton of
[2063.22 --> 2068.18]  money for full self-driving capability on your car whether it's a tesla or whatever else it is in the
[2068.18 --> 2074.82]  future but that doesn't mean that i don't have to be bummed that i can't just pay for it once now for
[2074.82 --> 2082.58]  now they are still offering the option to pay for it once but what we also don't know is what that
[2082.58 --> 2089.62]  looks like in the future um you know team viewer for example you used to be able to buy just once i own a
[2089.62 --> 2095.78]  perpetual license for team viewer 12 which is why i refuse to update from team viewer 12 because now with
[2095.78 --> 2101.70]  team viewer whatever we're on 15 or 16 or something like that there is no option to buy it outright you
[2101.70 --> 2108.90]  absolutely must subscribe to it as a service so nothing would technically prevent tesla from saying
[2108.90 --> 2119.22]  oh oh well oh oh you bought full self-driving 1.0 this is full self-driving 2.0 and we're not off it's like
[2119.22 --> 2127.54]  got it's got you know support for the rocket boosted acceleration on the roadster 2.0 uh so yeah in
[2127.54 --> 2132.58]  order to account for that we really had to fine-tune some things so you really need the new software
[2133.30 --> 2139.86]  nothing would also prevent them from just sunsetting the original one and tesla has a long and proud
[2139.86 --> 2145.78]  history of announcing programs and then sort of unexpectedly or with some warnings sunsetting them
[2145.78 --> 2152.34]  whether it's the referral program or the free supercharging or whatever the case may be so what
[2152.34 --> 2159.78]  this is is tesla telegraphing what the future is going to look like full self-driving buying it outright
[2159.78 --> 2166.42]  is either going to go away if we stay on this trajectory or it's going to get prohibitively
[2166.42 --> 2172.90]  expensive to the point where it just doesn't make sense anymore and subscriptions are going to be a thing
[2172.90 --> 2180.10]  but for those of you who are you know over my dead body you know subscriptions for my car that i own
[2180.66 --> 2187.38]  uh i have some words of i have some words of comfort for you uh you know don't worry because in the
[2187.38 --> 2193.38]  future it won't matter that you never actually own the car you bought because by the time self-driving
[2193.38 --> 2198.58]  is actually practical to use you will not be buying a car uh because remember guys
[2198.58 --> 2205.06]  yeah better way of saying it i'm not just talking about the capability to fully self-drive uh that
[2205.06 --> 2212.82]  could be sooner i'm talking about full self-driving being actually put my feet up in the back seat and
[2212.82 --> 2220.82]  read a book safe have a nap like every no awareness required type of that's right every edge case that
[2220.82 --> 2228.26]  could possibly come up that car is gonna know what to do and not only that but that level of capability
[2228.26 --> 2234.34]  has been around so long that notoriously slow legislators are going to have actually created
[2234.34 --> 2239.78]  laws to allow these things to be used without you paying attention to them on public roads by the time
[2239.78 --> 2247.62]  that happens you will not buy a car that's the whole idea the fleet is just gonna drive around uber style
[2247.62 --> 2253.46]  and it'll be pay as you go baby the fleet owner will pay for the subscriptions and that is the future
[2253.46 --> 2261.86]  whether you freaking like it or not that's coming for you because there's so many things about it
[2261.86 --> 2268.74]  that are just i mean governments are gonna eat this up what whoa hold on a second and businesses too
[2268.74 --> 2276.02]  i've already seen the parking regulations here in the area where we live go way down because cities are
[2276.02 --> 2281.46]  trying to get fewer cars parking i forget what it is but in an average city there's something like
[2282.02 --> 2290.58]  seven or like nine parking stalls for every car because grocery store home work these are all
[2290.58 --> 2298.90]  places that kind of like everyone zerg rushes to all at once and these are parking stalls that sit empty
[2298.90 --> 2306.74]  the vast vast majority of the time so for cities to be able to claw back parking space for businesses
[2306.74 --> 2312.34]  to be able to build up for for property developers to be able to build out buildings with far less
[2312.34 --> 2317.86]  parking in them and be able to justify it i mean there's apartment buildings in vancouver that you
[2317.86 --> 2323.86]  can buy now that do not have a parking stall assigned to them that you cannot get a parking stall assigned to
[2323.86 --> 2330.90]  you are just expected to not own a car um so it's happening and i'm sure chat which i'm not looking at is
[2330.90 --> 2336.26]  full of people who live in rural utah or whatever like they'll pry my truck for my cold dead fingers
[2337.14 --> 2343.06]  yeah of course there's always going to be places where that's not going to be the case but when i
[2343.06 --> 2350.82]  talk about the future i'm not talking about the 1930s i'm talking about the future places where it
[2350.82 --> 2355.46]  is the same as it has been for a hundred years yeah it'll probably be a little slower
[2355.46 --> 2360.58]  um so it's just like when i talk about you know fiber to the home being the future yeah it's going
[2360.58 --> 2366.42]  to take a long time in a lot of areas but that doesn't change that that's the direction to work
[2366.42 --> 2371.46]  vehicles and stuff like that are are is is not really what he's talking about it's it's like yeah
[2371.46 --> 2377.78]  it's it's these like mass commodity usage cars like if you if you use your car essentially twice a day
[2378.34 --> 2385.06]  to to go to to go to work and to go home or to like go to your friend's house or something and to go
[2385.06 --> 2392.02]  home on the weekend and that's basically it you're if you think about it that asset is more or less
[2392.02 --> 2396.90]  being being wasted while it's just sitting there yes it loses value the more you drive around and
[2396.90 --> 2401.78]  the more you use it and stuff like that but um if you could use it at those times it would be more
[2401.78 --> 2407.86]  valuable um so even even the potential idea which i don't really think will be a thing um but is where
[2407.86 --> 2413.54]  you could like buy a car and sign it up for a service where it goes around and drives and picks people
[2413.54 --> 2420.82]  up uh maybe that'll be a thing uh the like the the man what's even the name of it i think tesla has
[2420.82 --> 2429.22]  said that they want to allow people to uh kind of um sublet their their cars that they own into the tesla
[2429.22 --> 2434.50]  like fleet i think this is something they've already talked about uh something else occurred to me too
[2434.50 --> 2441.94]  icbc so that's our local insurance monopoly that exists for whatever reason um icbc recently changed a
[2441.94 --> 2447.14]  lot of the way they're handling insurance to be more tied to the driver and less tied to the vehicle
[2447.14 --> 2455.30]  so that's yet another thing that is happening as the as the world shifts to owners just having their
[2455.30 --> 2461.62]  own insurance and vehicles just being like a thing that sits on the curb until you get into it and drive
[2461.62 --> 2468.50]  it somewhere and to be clear guys the people who are upset about this trust me it's not like i'm not
[2468.50 --> 2473.78]  with you i want to own my own car so that it's like right there ready for me to use and i don't
[2473.78 --> 2479.46]  have to deal with someone else's smelly dog or whatever that was in the back of this shared vehicle
[2479.46 --> 2486.34]  like trust me i get it it's not that i'm against you it's just that this is happening so i wouldn't
[2486.34 --> 2492.90]  be surprised if there was like premium like high availability options oh for sure where when a
[2492.90 --> 2500.34]  vehicle was not being used it like parked itself by you you know what i mean and it'll get all machine
[2500.34 --> 2505.54]  learningy and it'll know like approximately what times people like to go where and once you've got
[2505.54 --> 2512.98]  enough people using the service it's going to uh it's like it's kind of like anything like okay abcs of
[2512.98 --> 2521.54]  gaming sells anywhere from 40 to 60 units a day on ltt store and it's just like once you reach a certain
[2521.54 --> 2528.42]  scale you get that level of predictability like it just happens right um so you guys know how much
[2528.42 --> 2533.22]  to order and when to order it that kind of stuff like everyone thinks that they're an individual
[2533.22 --> 2539.78]  snowflake but actually there are there are just patterns that start to emerge once the data set
[2539.78 --> 2544.66]  gets big enough and that's how you know facebook and google have gone and made a fortune right
[2544.66 --> 2553.38]  um so yeah it's it's happening and you know what they can they can pry my vault from my cold dead fingers
[2554.34 --> 2559.70]  and they might just do they might just do such a thing but i doubt that i doubt that my youngest child
[2559.70 --> 2568.42]  will see any purpose in learning to drive like at your youngest but but not 12 years 12 years i suspect my
[2568.42 --> 2576.98]  son for a variety of reasons like aside from just like um wanting to learn it i think he would just
[2576.98 --> 2582.90]  want to regardless yeah yeah okay it's kind of a control freak uh and well like and i'm not saying
[2582.90 --> 2590.58]  that's a bad thing like i want to operate my vehicle i am quite certain that i can operate my own vehicle
[2590.58 --> 2597.54]  in a way that is safer than an ai will be able to operate it for a very very long time because i do things
[2597.54 --> 2604.26]  that are not technically legal but improve my safety on the road so perfect example okay if it's
[2604.26 --> 2613.14]  if it's raining instead of staying in exactly the middle of my lane what i will do is i will go and i
[2613.14 --> 2619.22]  will just ride i'll ride the dotted line because i know that there are there are kind of divots in the
[2619.22 --> 2624.42]  road where the tires travel the most where water tends to pool and it's more likely to hydroplane that's
[2624.42 --> 2632.82]  put a bird on it you know um so the way that so if nobody else is on the road the way that i would
[2632.82 --> 2643.06]  drive is absolutely illegal but from a not crashing into a barrier standpoint is safer and in much the
[2643.06 --> 2651.46]  same way i will often maintain like crazy buffer zones around vehicles that i you know think might not be
[2651.46 --> 2655.62]  able to see me very well or that i have been observing for some time and i find their behavior
[2655.62 --> 2662.98]  to be erratic i'm a very defensive driver so for a long time it will be even if a self-driving car is
[2662.98 --> 2668.58]  safer than the average driver it will probably be safer for me to operate my vehicle than to allow a
[2668.58 --> 2674.90]  robot to do it however compared to me in a distracted state like if i'm hungry and i need to eat something
[2674.90 --> 2681.70]  well i could probably i could probably let fsd take over and i think you're going to run into some
[2681.70 --> 2690.90]  issues there with with people that want to think that uh but probably shouldn't oh man i know so many
[2690.90 --> 2703.14]  of those and like um yeah luca what are you saying by the way nothing i uh i just i i think yeah it's it's
[2703.14 --> 2707.70]  it's it's it's going to be interesting because the people aren't going to want to admit that they
[2707.70 --> 2714.98]  should just let a car drive itself oh yeah whereas and like i i think in a lot of cases it it just
[2714.98 --> 2720.90]  should because of that that um like right now not good enough whatever but once it is good enough the
[2720.90 --> 2726.50]  the permanent awareness is going to be so huge um because the amount of things that can distract
[2727.06 --> 2732.50]  someone while they're driving is very high and and to assume that you can always at every single
[2732.50 --> 2739.94]  point in time be as aware as the end goal of this thing or at least even close to the approved by
[2739.94 --> 2745.62]  government goal of this thing is going to be um is probably going to be easton lovely says linus is
[2745.62 --> 2752.58]  describing how motorcycle riders have to drive all the time uh yes they're good habits they're good i am
[2752.58 --> 2758.74]  i do ride and they're good habits if you drive like you ride the likelihood of getting into an accident
[2758.74 --> 2765.86]  i mean it depends how you ride of course uh but if you ride if you ride safely if you ride defensively
[2765.86 --> 2773.06]  then it's it's good habits for always uh just maintaining a lot of space around you i mean the
[2773.06 --> 2778.26]  motorcycle is a fun one like my my wife doesn't like it obviously that i ride the bike and my whole
[2778.26 --> 2785.22]  defense to her is like look yes if i get in an accident on the bike it's worse i'm a pancake basically
[2785.22 --> 2791.14]  but the odds of me getting in an accident on the bike i would argue are significantly lower i have
[2791.14 --> 2797.70]  so much like i have had times where i was on the bike someone went and changed lanes without freaking
[2797.70 --> 2805.46]  looking at all and because i was on the bike not only did i have an extra like meter or two of space
[2805.46 --> 2811.14]  before they would make contact with me that i was able to use to get out of the way but because of my
[2811.14 --> 2818.26]  ability to instantly accelerate and not to mention brake faster than a cage yeah i was able to get out
[2818.26 --> 2824.18]  of the way i would have gotten into an accident in that case at no fault of my own if i had been in my
[2824.18 --> 2830.82]  car i've also noticed when driving around um because i have not ever been on a bike um but i've noticed
[2830.82 --> 2838.98]  when driving around that in in like annoying situations the the the the best people to kind of
[2838.98 --> 2843.86]  like you know that like no contact befriend if you know what i mean like you don't you don't
[2843.86 --> 2848.42]  necessarily even see each other but like yeah you're clearly not being jerks to each other is usually
[2848.42 --> 2853.30]  the people on bikes because they are usually paying more attention and especially in like traffic jam style
[2853.30 --> 2860.82]  situations people in cars like almost so many features in modern cars are like okay you don't hear
[2860.82 --> 2866.34]  it anymore okay you don't feel the road anymore okay it like yeah drives itself progressively more and
[2866.34 --> 2870.50]  more like it's there's all these things that are going to lull you into less and less awareness
[2870.50 --> 2876.10]  because you don't have to pay as much attention um and then bikes are like just not that at all
[2876.10 --> 2882.18]  meandres orbitalis uh figures there's a little bit of natural selection at work motorcycle riders are
[2882.18 --> 2892.26]  generally better because the bad ones don't stick around after making mistakes um yeah okay um sure yep that's
[2892.26 --> 2897.78]  fair enough um is there anything else we oh we should probably do the isps no longer allowed to
[2897.78 --> 2904.58]  charge rental fees bit yeah sure this is posted by spartaman64 over on the forum and it kind of tickled
[2904.58 --> 2911.78]  both me and luke uh broadband and tv providers will finally be required to stop charging rental fees for
[2911.78 --> 2917.06]  equipment that customers own thanks to a new us law that takes effect on sunday how did this take so long
[2917.06 --> 2924.34]  i mean to be clear like bravo it's about time some pro-consumer legislation passed um the change is
[2924.34 --> 2929.46]  good news for customers of frontier communications which has insisted on charging 10 rental fees to
[2929.46 --> 2935.38]  customers who use their own routers as we wrote sorry who's the article from ars technica as ars
[2935.38 --> 2941.62]  technica wrote in july 2019 frontier claimed it charged the fee to cover higher support costs for
[2941.62 --> 2946.98]  customers who use their own equipment okay fair enough except that frontier also said at the time that it
[2947.38 --> 2952.90]  cannot support or repair non-frontier equipment contradicting its own justification for charging
[2952.90 --> 2962.58]  the fee ridiculous hilarious about time there's like no way in hell that it costs them ten dollars
[2962.58 --> 2969.94]  a month in customer support per person to support all the people with their own routers i i i i would
[2971.06 --> 2976.02]  just wager a guess that the people with their own routers are probably costing them less in support to be
[2976.02 --> 2987.54]  honest probably probably um last topic intel is rumored to be taking back the gaming crown an 11 900
[2987.54 --> 2994.18]  engineering sample with a wimpy 1.8 gigahertz base clock uh this is a core i9 but don't worry
[2994.18 --> 3002.34]  a 3.8 gigahertz all core boost and maximum boost of 4.4 was spotted benchmarked uh the original source
[3002.34 --> 3010.02]  here is from wccf tech and tom's hardware and it looks like it could end up based on cinebench and
[3010.02 --> 3015.86]  ashes of the singularity so there's not these are not perfect benchmarks but their indicators looks
[3015.86 --> 3024.10]  like it could be as much as 20 percent faster than comet lake clock for clock which would put the gaming
[3024.10 --> 3033.38]  crown firmly back in intel's hands they're rumored to come out in q1 2021 so uh hey maybe uh maybe intel
[3033.38 --> 3041.14]  is hoping to you know have a better year in 2021 than the just absolute pounding they took in 2020
[3041.14 --> 3050.18]  um yeah it's 14 nanometer still though for those who are wondering yeah oh yeah um also ltt store boxing day
[3050.18 --> 3059.38]  style oh yeah we have a boxing day promotion on ltt store uh five dollars off everything store wide ends tomorrow at midnight pacific time
[3059.38 --> 3068.10]  pacific time oh my what is that noise is that you that's my bird sorry oh what's up okay you know
[3068.10 --> 3074.10]  what luke i don't think you've ever formally introduced the bird can we can we formally introduce the bird
[3074.74 --> 3082.90]  this is taquito oh geez he apparently wanted to be there instead his name is taquito um he he really
[3082.90 --> 3088.34]  enjoys talking so usually when we do the wan show he just sits there and he pulls one foot up and he just
[3088.34 --> 3093.30]  stands on one foot because that's usually like he's happy and comfortable hi he likes my nose too
[3093.30 --> 3098.18]  for whatever reason um it's glorious now but every once in a while he wants to be engaged in the
[3098.18 --> 3104.34]  conversation so he'll come over and uh as you saw i guess land on my head that's that's a bit of a new
[3104.34 --> 3110.98]  one he only started doing that yesterday uh but he'll start talking too and he really likes um
[3110.98 --> 3118.34]  um the the like wire that's next to my microphone so he'll stand on that but that means he's standing
[3118.34 --> 3125.94]  on my microphone hi there you go he's standing on my microphone um you can see he perches on a single finger
[3125.94 --> 3130.58]  um but yeah he stands on my microphone and talks which sometimes means if i'm like
[3131.38 --> 3136.82]  uh having a conversation with someone you can you can hear mr taquito i'm talking about you i noticed he got
[3136.82 --> 3143.54]  canceled out pretty good what are you using uh sm7b no no i mean um like it seemed like it was
[3143.54 --> 3151.38]  canceled do you have any like background noise cancellation on oh nope uh just a a uh discord
[3151.38 --> 3160.74]  by default has a uh what is it exactly called input sensitivity oh yeah yeah not bad not bad at all
[3160.74 --> 3166.74]  actually yeah it works okay all right so i guess i should do a handful of super chats but i think
[3166.74 --> 3172.58]  luke has a heart out three minutes ago so i don't want to get you in trouble with plenty time okay all
[3172.58 --> 3177.22]  right see you later probably good bye say bye he's just leaning towards my face he doesn't want to say
[3177.22 --> 3183.70]  bye at all bye all right ilia asks when comes the big shave i don't know haven't actually decided if
[3183.70 --> 3190.74]  i'm doing it or not oh oh uh there we go cool uh robert b says merry christmas hey thank you
[3191.30 --> 3197.30]  brandon says hey did you ever get used to youtube music since google music is gone uh no i kind of i
[3197.30 --> 3202.90]  think i might just have to switch to spotify um they still haven't figured out how to get kids accounts
[3202.90 --> 3210.58]  working because youtube doesn't allow kids under 13 to use it so youtube music has that same limitation
[3210.58 --> 3217.70]  even though my kids really they offer a family plan and kids can't use it which is super stupid
[3217.70 --> 3221.70]  so i'm just gonna have to switch over to spotify i think my other issue is that you can't stream
[3221.70 --> 3226.18]  straight to sonos speakers through the app you could with google play music i suspect that will
[3226.18 --> 3231.70]  just never get fixed because of the ongoing legal dispute between sonos and google so i'm just gonna
[3231.70 --> 3238.10]  have to like manually port over my playlists i guess unless there's a faster way uh day wo asks why
[3238.10 --> 3242.98]  does your hair look greasy because it's super greasy i haven't gone to work all week so i have
[3242.98 --> 3248.74]  not washed my hair in like four days so that's what it looks like so if you were wondering if i
[3248.74 --> 3257.78]  normally wash my hair the answer is yes uh sweet manok glad to hear that happy to help mike adam says
[3257.78 --> 3262.18]  happy christmas guys managing to catch you live today from the uk loving the show hey thank you very much
[3262.98 --> 3268.10]  finn says first time watching live by the way could ltt store be a distributor for vessi shoes since they
[3268.10 --> 3275.86]  don't ship them more worldwide i mean we haven't really explored the idea of just selling like other
[3275.86 --> 3282.50]  people's stuff i guess we could think about it but i can tell you now from like a business standpoint we
[3282.50 --> 3288.66]  are more interested in selling our own stuff just because you know it doesn't pollute the messaging right
[3288.66 --> 3295.86]  like where do you go to buy ltt stuff ltdstore.com where do you go to buy other stuff some other
[3295.86 --> 3300.66]  place like i don't know uh i'll think about it though johnny sm says great to see you two live
[3300.66 --> 3304.66]  finally what do you mean finally we can go live every week why must you have some air conditioning
[3304.66 --> 3311.86]  in your home server room i do not are they hot and loud um they're like loudish but not hot because
[3311.86 --> 3317.06]  what i do have is a fan in there i made a video about that a while back and then uh with the new
[3317.06 --> 3322.10]  insulation that we blew into the attic space actually there's no exhaust for it but i can
[3322.10 --> 3326.10]  open up a door into my other attic space in the summer in the winter the cold air coming in is so
[3326.10 --> 3332.02]  cold that it's like fine um james says hate sending super chats because hate supporting youtube but just
[3332.02 --> 3337.46]  wanted to say thank you for the christmas stream you guys rock thanks james b um thomas die says merry
[3337.46 --> 3343.54]  christmas merry christmas to you too thomas die uh mike adams says please use do not disturb on teams
[3343.54 --> 3348.02]  uh it mutes all notifications and then it doesn't make me think my work's trying to get a hold of me
[3348.02 --> 3352.98]  okay i did mute it i muted it with the volume mixer but that's another way to do it uh robert mail says
[3352.98 --> 3358.26]  with your us stimulus you can buy one of each item on ltt store single style and size and still have
[3358.26 --> 3365.86]  money left over hey thanks robert that's a great tech tip right there cool man says uh hi bro and that's
[3365.86 --> 3370.82]  pretty much it cole what's up cole says merry christmas haven't caught you guys live in a long
[3370.82 --> 3377.62]  time yeah how's that tj07 treating you this guy drove all the way like hours to come by like my old
[3377.62 --> 3383.46]  was it a tj07 i think so i think it was an old tj07 case or something like that was it a tj07 or was
[3383.46 --> 3391.62]  it like some server case i i don't remember slushy says tips on being a tech youtuber well um step one
[3392.34 --> 3405.86]  be a youtuber step two focus on tech oh yeah uh i don't know i mean ah it's really hard to say it's
[3405.86 --> 3410.26]  it's hard to say what do you say people ask me that kind of stuff all the time and i just never really
[3410.26 --> 3415.70]  know how to respond to it because the answer is that i can't give you the answer if i could give you the
[3415.70 --> 3427.14]  answer then um like it it wouldn't be the answer if that kind of makes sense because part of breaking
[3427.14 --> 3433.14]  out is finding your own style and your own voice and i can't tell you what that is so that's the
[3433.14 --> 3438.10]  best tip i can give is that you shouldn't follow anyone else you should figure out your own path
[3438.10 --> 3444.98]  um doug says i ordered a desk pad two weeks ago i can't get any updates on the order uh you got a
[3444.98 --> 3449.46]  message support and they have been out all week because our whole staff has been out all week for
[3449.46 --> 3454.42]  christmas but they'll be back in on monday and that's not a mistake i know it's the first but we
[3454.42 --> 3460.98]  moved the stat to this week so we are back in office on uh monday or wait no friday it's friday that's the
[3460.98 --> 3465.22]  first right whatever it doesn't matter the point is we're back in in monday we're in all week next week
[3465.22 --> 3471.54]  um we'd love to do something on solar um king of soldiers and if we did we would definitely make
[3471.54 --> 3477.86]  a video about it wireless valve index is that a thing now do they have an adapter oh i hope so
[3481.06 --> 3488.82]  is oh is it on the way a patent says yes from july uh yeah nothing nothing has developed on this since
[3488.82 --> 3494.90]  july so yeah we'll see we'll see just because valve patents something doesn't mean we'll see it anytime
[3494.90 --> 3500.90]  soon all right see you later my float plane peeps lord chuck um we're going to be restocking the
[3500.90 --> 3507.06]  northern lights desk pad in a couple of months unfortunately it takes that long because we
[3507.06 --> 3516.58]  sold them all um so now they're gone yeah um flash says average stopping distance of all cars is around
[3516.58 --> 3523.46]  132 feet and motorcycles range from 80 to 246 if you include thinking time cool thank you for that
[3523.46 --> 3530.74]  linus's room appears to be almost entirely populated with doors says astromanta yes most of them are real
[3530.74 --> 3543.46]  and also fake real fake doors see you later ladies and gentlemen hope you enjoyed the show
