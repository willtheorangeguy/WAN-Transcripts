[0.26 → 1.38] I have no clue.
[2.92 → 4.38] I'm just going to keep repeating.
[5.24 → 8.24] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the WAN show.
[8.32 → 9.52] Welcome to the WAN show.
[9.70 → 13.50] I do actually think we're live everywhere now, so that is fantastic.
[14.14 → 15.76] It is the NEW show again.
[15.90 → 17.64] Myself and James, back at it.
[18.00 → 18.72] Back in action.
[18.86 → 22.30] It's been so long since we had a NEW show that I don't even really remember the origin of it.
[23.30 → 24.96] I guess it's backwards.
[24.96 → 25.56] It's just backwards.
[25.56 → 25.62] It's just backwards.
[25.62 → 25.80] It's backwards.
[26.00 → 26.18] Yeah.
[27.12 → 27.64] Bizarrely.
[27.64 → 29.62] I feel like there was some reason why we did that.
[29.62 → 32.58] But it's lost to time and space now.
[32.70 → 33.46] But anyway, yeah.
[34.36 → 35.56] Hopefully, you've had a wonderful Friday.
[35.68 → 36.62] Hopefully, you had a wonderful week.
[37.04 → 37.80] Welcome to the WAN show.
[37.90 → 38.94] I don't see us on.
[39.02 → 39.42] There it is.
[39.48 → 40.06] We are live.
[40.34 → 40.74] Fantastic.
[41.28 → 45.28] We've got some actually great topics, some things that I'm actually really excited to talk about this week.
[45.64 → 46.18] We also have some boring stuff.
[46.18 → 49.64] I want to talk about Fortnite versus Apple and Google.
[49.78 → 50.02] Yes.
[50.02 → 51.24] Apple's customer business.
[51.44 → 52.30] This is crazy.
[52.36 → 53.16] I'm so excited.
[53.46 → 54.78] I am so excited.
[55.66 → 55.88] But yeah.
[55.96 → 56.14] Okay.
[56.32 → 57.34] Fortnite versus Apple and Google.
[57.34 → 58.36] Like he just said.
[58.36 → 63.52] We've also got the Starlink beta test and speeds, which are like pretty spicy.
[64.40 → 68.80] We've got Intel details, Tiger Lake architecture and process improvements.
[69.38 → 70.74] And James, one more.
[71.00 → 72.92] There's also the Microsoft Surface Duo.
[73.48 → 74.92] I can't decide if I care.
[75.04 → 75.64] I kind of care.
[75.98 → 76.52] Kind of sweet.
[76.52 → 77.44] Maybe a little care.
[78.56 → 79.98] Maybe a huge care.
[80.26 → 80.96] Maybe two cares.
[81.08 → 81.54] Duo cares.
[81.80 → 83.04] Anyway, that was a terrible joke.
[83.14 → 83.78] WAN show intro.
[85.44 → 87.78] Dude, is that from that Honda commercial?
[87.94 → 88.32] The crab?
[89.98 → 90.78] Maybe this is true?
[90.78 → 105.62] I can't wait.
[105.62 → 105.70] Display.
[107.36 → 107.88] Display.
[108.08 → 108.60] Messy.
[109.82 → 111.32] Yeah, that's some good words.
[111.54 → 112.68] And PIA.
[114.12 → 114.68] Yay.
[115.06 → 115.92] G.I. Joe.
[118.86 → 119.68] All right.
[119.68 → 122.98] So far the stream has not blown up
[122.98 → 124.66] So I'm actually pretty happy
[124.66 → 125.74] With how we're doing so far
[125.74 → 128.86] And I'm also pretty happy
[128.86 → 131.24] About Morpheus Fighting Neo
[131.24 → 132.70] Or David vs.
[132.76 → 134.02] It's not really David vs. Goliath
[134.02 → 136.42] Some giant company that doesn't care about me
[136.42 → 138.50] Versus some other giant company that doesn't care about me
[138.50 → 140.94] Which is Fortnite vs. Apple
[140.94 → 142.66] Or Epic Games vs. Apple
[142.66 → 143.88] And Google now
[143.88 → 145.46] The story has continued
[145.46 → 148.38] They've been kicked off of the Play Store as well
[148.38 → 149.88] On Google stuff
[149.88 → 151.12] That's crazy
[151.12 → 152.72] So insane
[152.72 → 154.78] So basically what happened was
[154.78 → 156.06] Epic Games
[156.06 → 159.20] They had this strategy in their back pocket
[159.20 → 160.90] They were just waiting to deploy
[160.90 → 162.50] And I guess the timing is right
[162.50 → 163.56] With all the
[163.56 → 165.52] Senate
[165.52 → 169.36] The scrutiny that the tech giants
[169.36 → 169.82] Have been under
[169.82 → 171.90] Whereas last week Jeff Bezos
[171.90 → 174.18] And Satin Adana, Tim Cook
[174.18 → 176.56] And who was the fourth person?
[177.74 → 178.22] Was it Mark?
[178.38 → 178.88] Oh Microsoft
[178.88 → 180.00] Microsoft wasn't there
[180.00 → 181.18] Zuckerberg was there
[181.18 → 182.46] Tim Cook was there
[182.46 → 183.20] Amazon was there
[183.20 → 183.96] Yeah
[183.96 → 185.08] And um
[185.08 → 186.66] I guess they're just
[186.66 → 188.38] Now that everyone's talking about
[188.38 → 189.36] Monopolies and antitrust
[189.36 → 190.10] It's time for
[190.10 → 191.38] For Epic Games to say
[191.38 → 191.82] You know what?
[192.28 → 193.62] It is a monopoly
[193.62 → 195.26] These Play Stores
[195.26 → 195.64] And the
[195.64 → 196.12] And these
[196.12 → 196.98] The Apple
[196.98 → 198.00] App Store
[198.00 → 198.84] They are a monopoly
[198.84 → 200.12] They're the only way that
[200.12 → 201.78] We can get access
[201.78 → 203.76] To billions of devices
[203.76 → 205.60] And every time
[205.60 → 206.72] These guys are taking
[206.72 → 207.64] 30%
[207.64 → 208.86] Of the money we make
[208.86 → 210.16] Yeah
[210.16 → 211.42] It's time for this to end
[211.42 → 212.58] Especially for
[212.58 → 213.38] For us
[213.38 → 213.82] Like
[213.82 → 215.30] Us as in
[215.30 → 215.82] Float plane
[215.82 → 217.08] It's
[217.08 → 218.14] It's kind of
[218.14 → 220.20] Extremely destructive
[220.20 → 221.66] So other
[221.66 → 222.26] Other
[222.26 → 223.04] Payment
[223.04 → 223.96] So yeah
[223.96 → 224.88] I made a lot of
[224.88 → 225.90] Tweets about this
[225.90 → 226.48] And I heard a lot of
[226.48 → 226.90] Feedback
[226.90 → 227.86] One thing that I heard
[227.86 → 228.50] From some people
[228.50 → 229.64] Were like
[229.64 → 230.36] Oh well I don't
[230.36 → 231.20] I don't want to like
[231.20 → 232.08] Trust my
[232.08 → 233.00] My payment information
[233.00 → 233.68] To every app
[233.68 → 234.32] That's on the App Store
[234.32 → 235.04] I'd rather use
[235.04 → 236.10] Apple Payments
[236.10 → 236.62] And honestly
[236.62 → 237.44] You rather
[237.44 → 238.62] You preferring to use
[238.62 → 239.14] Apple Payments
[239.14 → 239.90] Is not an issue
[239.90 → 240.30] To me
[240.30 → 240.86] And I'll talk about
[240.86 → 241.64] That more later on
[241.64 → 244.00] But we don't
[244.00 → 244.84] I don't
[244.84 → 245.24] Ever
[245.24 → 246.32] Want to touch
[246.32 → 247.10] Your payment information
[247.10 → 248.78] That is the last thing
[248.78 → 249.60] I want to do
[249.60 → 250.46] Trust me
[250.46 → 251.10] I don't want
[251.10 → 252.42] Any of that information
[252.42 → 253.14] Ever
[253.14 → 253.80] Which is why
[253.80 → 254.30] We use
[254.30 → 255.54] Payment processors
[255.54 → 256.16] Which is like
[256.16 → 257.48] What everybody does
[257.48 → 258.06] That's like
[258.06 → 259.06] For us
[259.06 → 260.24] It's Stripe and Braintree
[260.24 → 261.26] Braintree is effectively
[261.26 → 261.90] Just PayPal
[261.90 → 263.64] For most people
[263.64 → 264.90] It's Stripe and Braintree
[264.90 → 266.00] Or just Braintree
[266.00 → 266.96] Or just Stripe
[266.96 → 268.18] Or something like that
[268.18 → 268.84] Those are the main
[268.84 → 269.74] Players in the space
[269.74 → 270.94] There are other
[270.94 → 272.58] Players depending on
[272.58 → 273.50] Where you are
[273.50 → 274.34] In the world as well
[274.34 → 274.96] That might be
[274.96 → 275.68] More prevalent
[275.68 → 276.52] Than Stripe or Braintree
[276.52 → 277.00] But those are
[277.00 → 277.62] Those are huge
[277.62 → 278.28] In North America
[278.28 → 279.68] And
[279.68 → 280.16] Yeah
[280.16 → 281.38] Other players like Apple
[281.38 → 282.08] Yeah
[282.08 → 282.84] I mean Apple
[282.84 → 284.00] Amazon
[284.00 → 286.34] Alibaba
[286.34 → 287.68] Like a lot of
[287.68 → 289.08] Massive companies
[289.08 → 289.92] Might have their own
[289.92 → 290.48] Payment system
[290.48 → 291.88] But these little companies
[291.88 → 292.76] Like Float plane
[292.76 → 294.04] We're not going to have
[294.04 → 294.76] Our own payment system
[294.76 → 295.38] We're just going to
[295.38 → 295.84] Why would you want
[295.84 → 296.34] To build that
[296.34 → 297.30] Why would we want
[297.30 → 297.74] To build that
[297.74 → 298.34] Why would we want
[298.34 → 299.00] The liability
[299.00 → 300.08] There's
[300.08 → 301.24] There is no way
[301.24 → 302.20] I would ever want
[302.20 → 302.60] To touch
[302.60 → 303.58] Your credit card number
[303.58 → 304.12] Because I don't
[304.12 → 304.82] Want the liability
[304.82 → 305.72] Well this is actually
[305.72 → 306.90] Part of Apple's defence
[306.90 → 307.58] As they say
[307.58 → 308.66] We're actually doing
[308.66 → 309.96] Developers a favour
[309.96 → 310.76] Handling all that
[310.76 → 311.18] For them
[311.18 → 311.82] So it's good
[311.82 → 313.56] So I will touch there
[313.56 → 314.82] Because I personally
[314.82 → 315.90] Have no issue
[315.90 → 317.00] Having an option
[317.00 → 318.28] To have Apple Pay
[318.28 → 319.22] In the app
[319.22 → 320.54] And that's actually
[320.54 → 322.98] Kind of interesting
[322.98 → 323.82] To this story
[323.82 → 325.04] Because Epic Games
[325.04 → 325.94] Sort of did that
[325.94 → 327.54] They had the
[327.54 → 329.06] Pay through us
[329.06 → 330.24] Directly option
[330.24 → 330.96] And they had
[330.96 → 331.90] The Apple Pay option
[331.90 → 333.36] The payment processors
[333.36 → 334.28] Will generally
[334.28 → 335.14] Take
[335.14 → 335.84] I believe it's
[335.84 → 337.06] 2.9%
[337.06 → 338.10] Plus 30 cents
[338.10 → 338.68] You might be surprised
[338.68 → 339.50] If I said I believe
[339.50 → 340.66] The reason for that
[340.66 → 341.58] Is because it changes
[341.58 → 342.10] Depending on what
[342.10 → 343.48] The origin country is
[343.48 → 344.30] And it changes on
[344.30 → 344.76] Where the payment
[344.76 → 345.34] Is coming from
[345.34 → 346.46] There are international charters
[346.46 → 347.04] There's a bunch of
[347.04 → 347.80] Other things going on
[347.80 → 348.42] I think it goes up
[348.42 → 349.38] To 3.7%
[349.38 → 350.70] On the percentage
[350.70 → 351.64] But generally stays
[351.64 → 352.30] At 30 cents
[352.30 → 354.64] What that usually is
[354.64 → 355.38] Is the percentage
[355.38 → 356.62] Is being passed over
[356.62 → 357.84] From the credit card company
[357.84 → 358.70] Say like MasterCard
[358.70 → 359.06] Or Visa
[359.06 → 359.92] Or whatever else
[359.92 → 361.48] And the flat fee
[361.48 → 362.42] The 30 cents
[362.42 → 363.16] Is usually
[363.16 → 364.30] What the payment processor
[364.30 → 364.78] Is taking
[364.78 → 366.00] 30 cents
[366.00 → 367.36] Plus 2.9%
[367.36 → 368.48] To 3.7%
[368.48 → 370.36] Is a lot lower
[370.36 → 371.76] Generally
[371.76 → 373.24] For a lot of things
[373.24 → 373.96] Than just
[373.96 → 375.16] A flat
[375.16 → 376.76] 30%
[376.76 → 378.24] Which is what
[378.24 → 379.46] Apple is trying to take
[379.46 → 380.18] That
[380.18 → 380.82] Is
[380.82 → 382.02] Massive
[382.02 → 383.52] And it might not
[383.52 → 384.40] Be that massive
[384.40 → 385.40] For actually
[385.40 → 386.52] Companies like
[386.52 → 387.20] Epic Games
[387.20 → 387.94] Where what they're
[387.94 → 388.72] Delivering you
[388.72 → 389.68] Is
[389.68 → 392.04] It's unlocking
[392.04 → 392.84] A skin in a game
[392.84 → 393.58] That's already there
[393.58 → 394.34] It's already in your
[394.34 → 395.04] Game files
[395.04 → 395.98] It doesn't cost them
[395.98 → 396.88] Anything to deliver it
[396.88 → 397.20] To you
[397.20 → 398.22] It's a zero
[398.22 → 399.14] Marginal cost
[399.14 → 399.68] Yes
[399.68 → 400.82] It did cost them
[400.82 → 402.16] Designer work
[402.16 → 403.04] To implement it
[403.04 → 404.04] It might have costed
[404.04 → 405.68] Them marketing dollars
[405.68 → 406.38] To push it out
[406.38 → 407.04] But there are
[407.04 → 407.66] Other costs
[407.66 → 408.00] To duplicate it
[408.00 → 408.92] To duplicate it
[408.92 → 409.74] There is nothing
[409.74 → 411.24] For us
[411.24 → 412.16] We have to
[412.16 → 413.20] Pay creators
[413.20 → 414.28] Every single time
[414.28 → 415.22] A payment comes to us
[415.22 → 416.24] We pay creators
[416.24 → 417.10] Also
[417.10 → 419.10] We have to deliver
[419.10 → 421.34] High quality content
[421.34 → 421.60] Video
[421.60 → 422.36] Like it's expensive
[422.36 → 423.58] To deliver all this
[423.58 → 424.98] High detail video
[424.98 → 425.44] To users
[425.44 → 426.34] So there are
[426.34 → 427.40] Heavy costs
[427.40 → 428.18] On our side
[428.18 → 429.34] Directly related
[429.34 → 430.48] To every purchase
[430.48 → 432.06] We can't just give up
[432.06 → 433.36] 30% of the value
[433.36 → 433.88] On every purchase
[433.88 → 435.20] We don't have that
[435.20 → 435.96] As an option
[435.96 → 436.86] If we want it
[436.86 → 437.44] To be a reasonable
[437.44 → 438.06] Business model
[438.06 → 439.78] So if we wanted
[439.78 → 440.62] To use Apple's
[440.62 → 441.26] Payment system
[441.26 → 441.96] Which I have
[441.96 → 442.82] No problem doing
[442.82 → 444.22] We'd have to
[444.22 → 445.10] Charge more
[445.10 → 447.06] But that's
[447.06 → 448.08] Against their terms
[448.08 → 449.98] You're not allowed
[449.98 → 450.98] To charge more
[450.98 → 452.52] For using Apple
[452.52 → 453.08] Payments
[453.08 → 455.20] You have to charge
[455.20 → 455.88] The same amount
[455.88 → 456.54] Across the board
[456.54 → 457.12] Because it can't be
[457.12 → 457.76] Worse experience
[457.76 → 458.54] For Apple users
[458.54 → 460.02] Which I would like
[460.02 → 460.76] To agree with
[460.76 → 461.60] But it's more expensive
[461.60 → 462.96] But does that
[462.96 → 463.80] Include things like
[463.80 → 464.96] If you go to our
[464.96 → 465.86] Website and subscribe
[465.86 → 467.12] And it's $2
[467.12 → 468.46] It can't be $3
[468.46 → 469.58] On the iPhone
[469.58 → 470.94] Oh my god
[470.94 → 472.22] That is crazy
[472.22 → 472.68] Right now
[472.68 → 473.50] We're in a situation
[473.50 → 474.18] Where
[474.18 → 476.46] We
[476.46 → 478.16] We have tried
[478.16 → 478.78] To remove
[478.78 → 480.00] Everything possible
[480.00 → 480.70] We have
[480.70 → 482.42] Borderline copied
[482.42 → 483.28] Some other apps
[483.28 → 484.20] That are on the app store
[484.20 → 484.92] With
[484.92 → 486.36] Which is not
[486.36 → 487.54] Our initial intention
[487.54 → 488.20] But it became
[488.20 → 489.00] Kind of our intention
[489.00 → 489.82] Because we were like
[489.82 → 490.64] Okay we need to
[490.64 → 491.08] Find a way
[491.08 → 491.84] To actually get on
[491.84 → 492.34] The store
[492.34 → 494.26] And we have
[494.26 → 495.20] Been denied
[495.20 → 496.12] Every time
[496.12 → 497.72] It feels almost
[497.72 → 498.24] Discriminatory
[498.24 → 498.92] At this point
[498.92 → 501.36] At this point
[501.36 → 501.74] They're like
[501.74 → 502.72] You can't reference
[502.72 → 505.22] Being able to
[505.22 → 505.86] Get subscriptions
[505.86 → 506.42] Anywhere else
[506.42 → 506.74] You can't
[506.74 → 507.48] Offboard anywhere else
[507.48 → 508.68] You can't
[508.68 → 509.24] Give someone
[509.24 → 510.02] A support link
[510.02 → 510.52] You can't give
[510.52 → 511.68] Someone an FAQ link
[511.68 → 512.48] You can't offboard
[512.48 → 513.14] Anyone to your
[513.14 → 513.70] Main website
[513.70 → 514.56] Because that might
[514.56 → 515.44] Encourage them to
[515.44 → 516.32] Subscribe there
[516.32 → 517.08] Instead of through
[517.08 → 517.44] The app
[517.44 → 518.24] So we took
[518.24 → 519.20] Everything out
[519.20 → 520.04] To the point
[520.04 → 520.66] Where you can't
[520.66 → 521.24] Even make an
[521.24 → 522.04] Account on the app
[522.04 → 522.44] And if you try
[522.44 → 523.02] To sign in
[523.02 → 523.44] With an account
[523.44 → 523.82] That doesn't
[523.82 → 524.40] Have a subscription
[524.40 → 525.34] It just says
[525.34 → 526.22] Like you can't
[526.22 → 526.58] Do that
[526.58 → 527.56] And that's it
[527.56 → 528.58] It doesn't say
[528.58 → 529.58] Like you have
[529.58 → 530.26] To go to the website
[530.26 → 531.28] It doesn't give you
[531.28 → 532.26] Any good information
[532.26 → 533.28] It's useless
[533.28 → 533.84] Nope
[533.84 → 535.40] It's a terrible app
[535.40 → 536.58] And they're still
[536.58 → 537.32] Like no there's
[537.32 → 537.96] Too many references
[537.96 → 538.66] To like going
[538.66 → 539.28] Outside the app
[539.28 → 540.14] There is none
[540.14 → 540.80] By the way
[540.80 → 541.22] They're just
[541.22 → 541.84] Blocking us
[541.84 → 542.42] For no reason
[542.42 → 544.72] For everyone's
[544.72 → 545.36] Frustration
[545.36 → 546.24] Apple trying to
[546.24 → 546.80] Get their money
[546.80 → 548.22] And for a company
[548.22 → 548.96] Like Epic Games
[548.96 → 549.54] Like they're talking
[549.54 → 550.66] About hundreds of
[550.66 → 551.74] Millions of dollars
[551.74 → 553.02] Like every year
[553.02 → 553.38] Right
[553.38 → 554.02] Oh yeah
[554.02 → 556.00] So what they did
[556.00 → 557.64] Was they updated
[557.64 → 558.06] Their app
[558.06 → 558.66] They did this on
[558.66 → 559.54] Android and iOS
[559.54 → 561.10] Now it's a bit of
[561.10 → 562.26] Less of an issue
[562.26 → 562.78] On Android
[562.78 → 563.42] Because you can
[563.42 → 564.32] Already sideload
[564.32 → 565.52] APKs on Android
[565.52 → 566.22] And just kind of
[566.22 → 566.72] Get whatever app
[566.72 → 567.42] You want anyway
[567.42 → 568.42] But it still
[568.42 → 569.22] Is millions of dollars
[569.22 → 569.88] So they did this
[569.88 → 570.90] On iOS and Android
[570.90 → 572.14] They made an update
[572.14 → 572.66] To the app
[572.66 → 573.78] That included
[573.78 → 574.48] Like you said
[574.48 → 576.06] The option to use
[576.06 → 576.50] Apple Pay
[576.50 → 577.60] And another option
[577.60 → 578.50] To buy directly
[578.50 → 579.02] From them
[579.02 → 580.36] And that was cheaper
[580.36 → 582.20] And that is
[582.20 → 583.22] Just crazy
[583.22 → 584.00] That they did that
[584.00 → 584.74] In my opinion
[584.74 → 585.60] Because what they're
[585.60 → 586.08] Saying
[586.08 → 587.86] They're basically
[587.86 → 588.80] Like weaponizing
[588.80 → 589.84] The whole fan base
[589.84 → 590.78] They're like
[590.78 → 591.88] Look everyone
[591.88 → 592.62] Around the world
[592.62 → 594.30] You are paying
[594.30 → 594.78] More
[594.78 → 596.38] Because these guys
[596.38 → 597.40] Control access
[597.40 → 598.66] This is a monopoly
[598.66 → 599.46] And it's hurting
[599.46 → 599.98] Consumers
[599.98 → 600.56] Because look
[600.56 → 601.48] You could be
[601.48 → 602.16] Paying less
[602.16 → 603.12] So they've just
[603.12 → 604.62] Like evangelized
[604.62 → 605.58] This like legion
[605.58 → 606.26] Of fans
[606.26 → 607.24] Turned them all
[607.24 → 607.80] Into zealots
[607.80 → 608.48] Got them on their
[608.48 → 608.90] Side
[608.90 → 610.62] And anyway
[610.62 → 611.18] The immediate
[611.18 → 612.06] Response from Apple
[612.06 → 612.36] And Google
[612.36 → 612.70] Of course
[612.70 → 613.10] Was to
[613.10 → 614.08] Take Fortnite
[614.08 → 615.02] Off of the store
[615.02 → 616.02] Yeah
[616.02 → 618.16] Yeah
[618.16 → 618.46] Do you know
[618.46 → 619.22] What Fortnite
[619.22 → 620.22] Did to any response
[620.22 → 621.58] They had
[621.58 → 623.00] Did you ever
[623.00 → 623.86] See the commercial
[623.86 → 624.36] Yes
[624.36 → 624.94] Of course
[624.94 → 626.64] That 1984 commercial
[626.64 → 628.28] It's an old
[628.28 → 629.10] Apple commercial
[629.10 → 629.98] And it was brilliant
[629.98 → 630.96] At the time
[630.96 → 631.92] It was fantastic
[631.92 → 632.02] Yeah
[632.02 → 632.56] And it was really
[632.56 → 633.22] Transgressive
[633.22 → 633.62] And it's supposed
[633.62 → 634.18] To look like
[634.18 → 634.56] I believe
[634.56 → 635.50] The movie 1984
[635.50 → 636.48] From the
[636.48 → 636.90] You know
[636.90 → 637.48] The Orwell
[637.48 → 638.04] Novel
[638.04 → 638.28] Yeah
[638.28 → 639.34] And it's basically
[639.34 → 640.08] A bunch of like
[640.08 → 641.46] These drone type
[641.46 → 642.66] People sitting
[642.66 → 643.50] In an audience
[643.50 → 644.60] While Big Brother
[644.60 → 645.18] Talks to them
[645.18 → 646.00] From this giant screen
[646.00 → 647.22] And then this one
[647.22 → 648.24] Like resistance
[648.24 → 648.82] Rebel
[648.82 → 650.16] Like slow motion
[650.16 → 650.96] Runs in with a
[650.96 → 651.74] Big sledgehammer
[651.74 → 652.82] And she throws
[652.82 → 653.46] At the giant
[653.46 → 654.22] Blue Big Brother
[654.22 → 655.38] And Big Brother
[655.38 → 655.92] Is supposed to
[655.92 → 656.66] Represent IBM
[656.66 → 657.60] Yes
[657.60 → 658.14] And it's like
[658.14 → 658.88] Break the mould
[658.88 → 659.90] She smashes the screen
[659.90 → 660.92] And everyone's liberated
[660.92 → 661.86] With their Apple devices
[661.86 → 662.70] And it was so
[662.70 → 663.60] Cool
[663.60 → 664.72] To be an Apple
[664.72 → 666.10] User back than
[666.10 → 667.42] Well guess what
[667.42 → 668.62] Go forward
[668.62 → 669.38] 30 years
[669.38 → 670.18] And guess who
[670.18 → 670.60] Big Brother
[670.60 → 671.22] Is now
[671.22 → 671.90] So
[671.90 → 672.92] Epic Games
[672.92 → 674.00] Produced this video
[674.00 → 674.94] That has
[674.94 → 675.80] Fortnite characters
[675.80 → 676.16] In it
[676.16 → 677.18] And it's fully animated
[677.18 → 677.82] But it looks
[677.82 → 678.72] Exactly like
[678.72 → 679.32] And animated
[679.32 → 680.14] In the style
[680.14 → 681.06] Of this previous
[681.06 → 681.40] Commercial
[681.40 → 682.72] But now
[682.72 → 683.40] There's like
[683.40 → 683.84] This big
[683.84 → 684.78] Big Brother
[684.78 → 685.24] Is transformed
[685.24 → 685.62] Into like
[685.62 → 686.00] A rotten
[686.00 → 686.74] Apple looking
[686.74 → 687.06] Character
[687.06 → 687.52] With a worm
[687.52 → 687.94] Coming out of
[687.94 → 688.26] His head
[688.26 → 689.46] And they
[689.46 → 690.40] Smash that screen
[690.40 → 690.78] And they're
[690.78 → 691.20] And they're
[691.20 → 691.68] Saying yeah
[691.68 → 692.16] These guys
[692.16 → 692.86] Have a monopoly
[692.86 → 693.96] On the app store
[693.96 → 695.64] And we want
[695.64 → 696.80] We want to smash
[696.80 → 697.10] That
[697.10 → 698.40] For the sake
[698.40 → 699.00] Of consumers
[699.00 → 699.62] Yeah
[699.62 → 700.52] Yeah
[700.52 → 701.82] And it's like
[701.82 → 702.20] It's
[702.20 → 703.14] I find things
[703.14 → 703.48] Like this
[703.48 → 703.80] Interesting
[703.80 → 704.18] Because
[704.18 → 704.92] This
[704.92 → 706.54] Truly was
[706.54 → 707.14] Like a big
[707.14 → 707.68] Part of
[707.68 → 708.68] Apple's identity
[708.68 → 709.12] If you
[709.12 → 709.64] If you want
[709.64 → 710.22] To go back
[710.22 → 710.62] I'm going to
[710.62 → 711.06] Tangent here
[711.06 → 711.36] A little bit
[711.36 → 711.54] I'm going to
[711.54 → 711.94] Tangent here
[711.94 → 712.64] Quite a few
[712.64 → 713.24] Times probably
[713.24 → 714.28] If you want
[714.28 → 714.70] To go back
[714.70 → 715.10] And watch
[715.10 → 716.00] A really cool
[716.00 → 716.32] Movie
[716.32 → 717.08] Honestly
[717.08 → 717.76] Probably
[717.76 → 718.58] Everyone watching
[718.58 → 718.96] This would
[718.96 → 719.62] Enjoy this movie
[719.62 → 720.32] Is called
[720.32 → 721.44] Pirates of Silicon Valley
[721.44 → 723.66] Fantastic movie
[723.66 → 724.20] It's
[724.20 → 724.52] It
[724.52 → 725.44] It goes over
[725.44 → 726.76] Essentially the origins
[726.76 → 727.48] Of like
[727.48 → 728.58] Apple and Microsoft
[728.58 → 729.90] And it's really
[729.90 → 730.50] Really cool
[730.50 → 731.80] And
[731.80 → 732.92] The mentality
[732.92 → 733.88] That
[733.88 → 734.62] Like Jobs
[734.62 → 735.24] Was pushing
[735.24 → 735.80] Back then
[735.80 → 736.98] Was extremely
[736.98 → 737.52] Aggressive
[737.52 → 738.26] Towards IBM
[738.26 → 738.76] Like
[738.76 → 739.76] Super
[739.76 → 740.42] Super aggressive
[740.42 → 741.08] Towards IBM
[741.08 → 742.08] IBM is
[742.08 → 743.32] Absolutely
[743.32 → 744.28] The enemy
[744.28 → 745.36] And this is a war
[745.36 → 746.24] Was like
[746.24 → 747.10] The type of
[747.10 → 748.04] Like direction
[748.04 → 748.64] He was pushing
[748.64 → 749.30] The company in
[749.30 → 750.46] Apple
[750.46 → 750.98] If you want
[750.98 → 751.24] If you want
[751.24 → 751.62] To look into
[751.62 → 751.98] I don't think
[751.98 → 752.32] I have great
[752.32 → 753.00] Screen capture
[753.00 → 753.40] Right now
[753.40 → 754.24] People saw
[754.24 → 755.24] The discord
[755.24 → 755.62] Minimize
[755.62 → 756.38] I'm not playing
[756.38 → 756.68] Wow
[756.68 → 757.58] I'll move it
[757.58 → 758.12] That's my
[758.12 → 759.02] Desktop background
[759.02 → 759.94] Calm down
[759.94 → 761.88] Jeez
[761.88 → 762.92] I just like
[762.92 → 763.48] Thunder bluff
[763.48 → 763.80] Okay
[763.80 → 765.04] But
[765.04 → 765.70] Apple
[765.70 → 767.22] Pirate flag
[767.22 → 769.54] There's like
[769.54 → 772.06] Actually official
[772.06 → 773.80] Apple pirate flag
[773.80 → 774.34] Stuff
[774.34 → 774.88] That they had
[774.88 → 775.52] In the office
[775.52 → 776.22] There are pictures
[776.22 → 777.48] Of Steve Jobs
[777.48 → 778.10] Sitting around
[778.10 → 778.60] With his
[778.60 → 779.48] Peeps
[779.48 → 780.76] With this
[780.76 → 781.44] Pirate flag
[781.44 → 782.10] In the background
[782.10 → 782.84] That has an
[782.84 → 783.42] Apple logo
[783.42 → 783.94] Over one of
[783.94 → 784.44] The eyes
[784.44 → 785.28] For their
[785.28 → 786.12] Something
[786.12 → 786.92] Anniversary
[786.92 → 787.46] I don't remember
[787.46 → 787.68] What
[787.68 → 788.20] They flew
[788.20 → 789.10] Pirate flags
[789.10 → 789.56] At all of
[789.56 → 790.14] Their headquarters
[790.14 → 791.08] Like this
[791.08 → 791.96] This like
[791.96 → 794.62] We're against
[794.62 → 795.36] The man
[795.36 → 796.46] Kind of
[796.46 → 797.48] Mentality
[797.48 → 798.30] It's in
[798.30 → 798.84] Their origin
[798.84 → 799.48] The first
[799.48 → 799.84] Product
[799.84 → 800.92] That Jobs
[800.92 → 801.36] And Was
[801.36 → 801.90] Ever made
[801.90 → 802.30] Together
[802.30 → 802.84] Back when
[802.84 → 803.38] I believe
[803.38 → 803.70] Jobs
[803.70 → 803.94] Was still
[803.94 → 804.24] In high
[804.24 → 804.46] School
[804.46 → 805.14] Was these
[805.14 → 805.86] Little boxes
[805.86 → 806.24] That they
[806.24 → 806.66] Used to
[806.66 → 807.38] Hack phones
[807.38 → 807.68] So that
[807.68 → 807.90] They could
[807.90 → 808.34] Make free
[808.34 → 808.84] Long distance
[808.84 → 809.44] Phone calls
[809.44 → 810.06] They sold
[810.06 → 810.32] For like
[810.32 → 810.98] 100 bucks
[810.98 → 812.08] With Captain
[812.08 → 812.42] Crunch
[812.42 → 812.72] Yeah
[812.72 → 813.88] Like that
[813.88 → 814.14] Was
[814.14 → 815.30] This is where
[815.30 → 815.86] Apple came
[815.86 → 816.14] From
[816.14 → 817.16] And now
[817.16 → 818.94] As many
[818.94 → 819.56] Problems as I
[819.56 → 820.08] Have with it
[820.08 → 820.44] And we'll go
[820.44 → 820.96] Into that in a
[820.96 → 821.16] Moment
[821.16 → 822.00] But that
[822.00 → 822.68] Fortnite
[822.68 → 823.36] 1984
[823.36 → 824.04] Commercial
[824.04 → 825.56] Positioning
[825.56 → 825.98] Apple
[825.98 → 826.78] On the
[826.78 → 827.66] Other side
[827.66 → 829.18] As like
[829.18 → 829.72] Kind of
[829.72 → 830.70] More cheesy
[830.70 → 831.16] And less
[831.16 → 831.72] Serious
[831.72 → 833.56] Sorry for the
[833.56 → 834.24] Slack notification
[834.24 → 835.06] As
[835.06 → 835.48] As
[835.48 → 836.44] As more
[836.44 → 836.82] Cheesy
[836.82 → 837.16] And less
[837.16 → 837.54] Serious
[837.54 → 837.94] As it
[837.94 → 838.36] Is
[838.36 → 839.98] Oh my
[839.98 → 840.32] Goodness
[840.32 → 840.88] Stop
[840.88 → 841.26] Messaging
[841.26 → 841.52] Mike
[841.52 → 844.62] It's kind
[844.62 → 844.80] Of
[844.80 → 845.60] Fair
[845.60 → 847.54] Yeah
[847.54 → 847.90] Well I
[847.90 → 848.04] Mean
[848.04 → 848.64] It's a little
[848.64 → 849.20] Awkward
[849.20 → 849.84] Coming from
[849.84 → 850.12] Epic
[850.12 → 850.90] For a bunch
[850.90 → 851.24] Of different
[851.24 → 851.44] Reasons
[851.44 → 851.54] Yeah
[851.54 → 851.88] They're big
[851.88 → 852.14] Too
[852.14 → 852.60] Yeah
[852.60 → 853.42] They're big
[853.42 → 853.68] Too
[853.68 → 854.08] And then
[854.08 → 854.94] They're kind
[854.94 → 855.12] Of
[855.12 → 855.80] They're 40%
[855.80 → 856.42] Chinese owned
[856.42 → 857.00] Which I guess
[857.00 → 858.28] Kind of flavours it a bit
[858.28 → 859.48] But it's definitely
[859.48 → 859.98] Valid
[859.98 → 861.48] It is
[861.48 → 862.50] It is very valid
[862.50 → 863.50] Criticism of
[863.50 → 863.98] Apple
[863.98 → 864.96] Regardless of
[864.96 → 865.52] Who it's coming
[865.52 → 865.80] From
[865.80 → 866.72] There are some
[866.72 → 867.46] Issues with
[867.46 → 868.06] The short
[868.06 → 869.66] As far as I know
[869.66 → 870.26] The short being
[870.26 → 871.54] The fortnight's
[871.54 → 872.14] Version of the
[872.14 → 872.78] Apple 1984
[872.78 → 873.22] Commercial
[873.22 → 874.22] As far as I know
[874.22 → 874.92] It was played
[874.92 → 875.62] In game
[875.62 → 876.62] Which at first
[876.62 → 877.02] I was like
[877.02 → 877.52] Oh that's cool
[877.52 → 877.86] I want to go
[877.86 → 878.32] Check it out
[878.32 → 879.64] And then later
[879.64 → 880.14] Was like
[880.14 → 884.28] While I am
[884.28 → 885.36] Very much happy
[885.36 → 886.34] About this legal
[886.34 → 887.04] Battle that's going
[887.04 → 887.62] On because
[887.62 → 888.78] Float plane over here
[888.78 → 889.16] Is getting
[889.16 → 889.92] Screwed over by
[889.92 → 890.92] Apple super hard
[890.92 → 891.64] But we're like
[891.64 → 892.96] Tiny ants on the
[892.96 → 893.26] Road
[893.26 → 894.50] And have no
[894.50 → 895.38] Ability to impact
[895.38 → 896.14] Really anything
[896.14 → 898.40] Compared to a
[898.40 → 899.68] Multi-trillion dollar
[899.68 → 900.50] Company that is
[900.50 → 900.88] Apple
[900.88 → 903.44] Epic might actually
[903.44 → 903.88] Be able to give
[903.88 → 904.74] Them a decent fight
[904.74 → 906.40] So that's cool
[906.40 → 906.88] I feel like
[906.88 → 907.70] There's a
[907.70 → 908.96] Goliath on my
[908.96 → 909.84] Side fighting the
[909.84 → 910.28] Other thing
[910.28 → 910.64] Which is
[910.64 → 910.94] Cool
[910.94 → 911.88] And just because
[911.88 → 912.42] We haven't said
[912.42 → 912.92] It explicitly
[912.92 → 914.80] Epic is suing
[914.80 → 915.28] Oh yeah
[915.28 → 916.52] Apple and Google
[916.52 → 916.80] Now
[916.80 → 917.42] Yeah they totally
[917.42 → 918.16] Weren't prepared
[918.16 → 918.80] They just had like
[918.80 → 920.04] A 62-page legal
[920.04 → 921.02] Document ready to go
[921.02 → 921.78] Immediately after
[921.78 → 922.20] They were kicked
[922.20 → 923.00] Off the App Store
[923.00 → 926.14] But it
[926.14 → 928.16] Yeah they
[928.16 → 928.98] They played it
[928.98 → 929.74] In game
[929.74 → 930.42] And they're
[930.42 → 931.12] Directing
[931.12 → 932.78] Fortnite players
[932.78 → 933.86] Specifically
[933.86 → 935.52] To like
[935.52 → 937.64] Talk about this
[937.64 → 938.10] And tweet out
[938.10 → 938.46] About this
[938.46 → 940.30] It is kind of
[940.30 → 942.30] Pushing propaganda
[942.30 → 943.12] Onto kids
[943.12 → 944.38] Directly
[944.38 → 945.46] Like playing it
[945.46 → 946.16] In the game
[946.16 → 947.00] Making an event
[947.00 → 947.82] In the game
[947.82 → 948.38] All that kind of
[948.38 → 948.66] Stuff
[948.66 → 949.80] I'm going to message
[949.80 → 950.48] This guy
[950.48 → 952.14] I kinda like it
[952.14 → 952.80] Though because
[952.80 → 954.20] It's weird
[954.20 → 955.56] Antitrust
[955.56 → 956.16] And monopoly
[956.16 → 958.20] Like law
[958.20 → 958.90] Is actually
[958.90 → 959.42] Really
[959.42 → 960.78] Tightly entangled
[960.78 → 961.10] With
[961.10 → 962.28] With democracy
[962.28 → 963.50] In a really
[963.50 → 964.14] Weird way
[964.14 → 964.94] Right but do you
[964.94 → 965.24] Want
[965.24 → 968.12] Small children
[968.12 → 968.82] Involved with
[968.82 → 969.44] Your democracy
[969.44 → 972.10] Well I mean
[972.10 → 972.90] Cause that's
[972.90 → 974.08] They're trying to
[974.08 → 975.08] They're trying to
[975.08 → 976.22] Get kids
[976.22 → 977.06] To like
[977.06 → 978.54] Speak up
[978.54 → 979.12] And get angry
[979.12 → 979.52] At Apple
[979.52 → 980.30] Who probably
[980.30 → 981.16] Have no real
[981.16 → 981.68] Understanding
[981.68 → 982.46] Of like
[982.46 → 983.10] What's actually
[983.10 → 983.82] Going on
[983.82 → 985.30] And they're
[985.30 → 985.72] Just like
[985.72 → 986.32] Oh they took
[986.32 → 986.88] My Fortnite
[986.88 → 987.86] From the app store
[987.86 → 989.38] Yeah but they also
[989.38 → 989.76] Know
[989.76 → 990.44] They know that
[990.44 → 991.32] It costs more
[991.32 → 991.68] Right
[991.68 → 992.34] They know the
[992.34 → 993.10] Price difference
[993.10 → 993.70] And I think
[993.70 → 994.20] That the way
[994.20 → 994.68] That people
[994.68 → 995.32] Interface
[995.32 → 995.80] I don't think
[995.80 → 996.34] They're technically
[996.34 → 997.16] Allowed to even
[997.16 → 998.32] Buy anything
[998.32 → 999.78] Well their parents
[999.78 → 1000.30] Are and that
[1000.30 → 1000.88] Has an effect
[1000.88 → 1001.20] On them
[1001.20 → 1002.10] Yeah I just
[1002.10 → 1002.58] I don't know
[1002.58 → 1003.74] Pushing propaganda
[1003.74 → 1004.20] On the kids
[1004.20 → 1004.44] Is
[1004.44 → 1006.66] It's problematic
[1006.66 → 1007.36] But what I'm
[1007.36 → 1008.06] Saying is like
[1008.06 → 1009.26] Our interface
[1009.26 → 1009.90] With power
[1009.90 → 1010.62] And authority
[1010.62 → 1012.14] IRL
[1012.14 → 1013.06] Is often
[1013.06 → 1013.70] Through
[1013.70 → 1014.40] Economic
[1014.40 → 1015.04] Stuff
[1015.04 → 1015.66] It's often
[1015.66 → 1016.64] Through our wallet
[1016.64 → 1017.60] And less so
[1017.60 → 1017.98] Than like
[1017.98 → 1018.58] Politics
[1018.58 → 1019.54] And so
[1019.54 → 1020.92] And economics
[1020.92 → 1021.30] Really
[1021.30 → 1022.68] Like when you
[1022.68 → 1023.28] Can garner
[1023.28 → 1023.72] A lot of
[1023.72 → 1024.54] Economic power
[1024.54 → 1025.90] That often
[1025.90 → 1026.88] Turns into
[1026.88 → 1027.70] Political power
[1027.70 → 1028.46] Whether that's
[1028.46 → 1029.02] Through lobbying
[1029.02 → 1029.58] Or funding
[1029.58 → 1030.04] Research
[1030.04 → 1031.80] Or staffing
[1031.80 → 1032.30] Government
[1032.30 → 1033.14] And so
[1033.14 → 1033.80] It is
[1033.80 → 1035.04] The fact that
[1035.04 → 1036.50] The US has a
[1036.50 → 1037.18] History of
[1037.18 → 1037.82] Breaking up
[1037.82 → 1038.38] Monopolies
[1038.38 → 1039.44] That is a
[1039.44 → 1039.98] History of
[1039.98 → 1040.46] Supporting
[1040.46 → 1040.94] Democracy
[1040.94 → 1041.78] Right
[1041.78 → 1043.08] So I think
[1043.08 → 1043.72] It's really cool
[1043.72 → 1044.26] That they're
[1044.26 → 1044.92] Getting all
[1044.92 → 1045.48] You know
[1045.48 → 1046.40] They're showing
[1046.40 → 1047.06] Everybody
[1047.06 → 1047.68] They made a
[1047.68 → 1048.40] Point to open
[1048.40 → 1048.90] Up the app
[1048.90 → 1049.40] And see
[1049.40 → 1050.06] How like
[1050.06 → 1050.50] Look this
[1050.50 → 1051.34] Affects you
[1051.34 → 1052.50] The people
[1052.50 → 1053.04] Yeah
[1053.04 → 1054.04] And it is
[1054.04 → 1054.28] Kind of
[1054.28 → 1054.86] Propaganda-y
[1054.86 → 1055.18] But it's
[1055.18 → 1055.54] Also
[1055.54 → 1056.36] You know
[1056.36 → 1056.70] We are
[1056.70 → 1057.16] All suffering
[1057.16 → 1058.14] And it's
[1058.14 → 1058.72] A monopoly
[1058.72 → 1059.38] I'm okay
[1059.38 → 1059.68] With the
[1059.68 → 1060.06] Message
[1060.06 → 1060.80] It becomes
[1060.80 → 1061.42] Awkward
[1061.42 → 1062.04] When it
[1062.04 → 1062.88] Seems to
[1062.88 → 1063.22] Be
[1063.22 → 1064.92] Not just
[1064.92 → 1065.44] Targeted at
[1065.44 → 1065.98] Fortnite fans
[1065.98 → 1066.88] But somewhat
[1066.88 → 1067.88] Specifically targeted
[1067.88 → 1068.32] At children
[1068.32 → 1068.84] But then I
[1068.84 → 1069.24] Don't know
[1069.24 → 1070.84] How you would
[1070.84 → 1071.44] Target it at
[1071.44 → 1072.08] Fortnite fans
[1072.08 → 1072.94] Without targeting
[1072.94 → 1073.42] It at children
[1073.42 → 1073.78] So
[1073.78 → 1075.58] Yeah I guess
[1075.58 → 1076.12] One kind of
[1076.12 → 1076.82] Follows the other
[1076.82 → 1077.20] Since
[1077.20 → 1077.58] Yeah
[1077.58 → 1079.10] Their fan base
[1079.10 → 1079.36] So
[1079.36 → 1079.74] Yeah
[1079.74 → 1080.28] And like
[1080.28 → 1080.76] Obviously
[1080.76 → 1081.20] There are
[1081.20 → 1081.94] People that
[1081.94 → 1082.40] Aren't
[1082.40 → 1083.08] Children that
[1083.08 → 1083.52] Play Fortnite
[1083.52 → 1084.70] But there
[1084.70 → 1085.34] Is a very
[1085.34 → 1085.84] Large amount
[1085.84 → 1086.08] Of people
[1086.08 → 1086.36] That play
[1086.36 → 1086.60] Fortnite
[1086.60 → 1087.10] That are
[1087.10 → 1087.38] Children
[1087.38 → 1088.34] So it
[1088.34 → 1088.90] Just becomes
[1088.90 → 1089.40] Kind of
[1089.40 → 1090.02] Awkward
[1090.02 → 1090.50] There
[1090.50 → 1091.56] That being
[1091.56 → 1091.94] Said there
[1091.94 → 1092.30] Was no
[1092.30 → 1093.14] Real call
[1093.14 → 1093.66] To action
[1093.66 → 1094.00] That I
[1094.00 → 1094.48] Could find
[1094.48 → 1095.02] Other than
[1095.02 → 1096.10] Just talking
[1096.10 → 1096.70] About things
[1096.70 → 1097.40] While including
[1097.40 → 1097.80] The free
[1097.80 → 1098.12] Fortnite
[1098.12 → 1098.76] Hashtag
[1098.76 → 1099.80] Which I
[1099.80 → 1100.30] Think probably
[1100.30 → 1100.82] Helps a
[1100.82 → 1101.22] Little bit
[1101.22 → 1103.82] But yeah
[1103.82 → 1104.58] There's the
[1104.58 → 1105.16] Other side
[1105.16 → 1105.48] Of it that
[1105.48 → 1105.86] People have
[1105.86 → 1106.26] Brought up
[1106.26 → 1106.58] Which is
[1106.58 → 1107.72] Like on
[1107.72 → 1108.32] Epic's
[1108.32 → 1108.94] Game Store
[1108.94 → 1109.46] They push
[1109.46 → 1110.12] Really hard
[1110.12 → 1111.74] For developer
[1111.74 → 1112.74] Exclusivity
[1112.74 → 1115.14] But they
[1115.14 → 1115.72] Do seem
[1115.72 → 1116.06] To take
[1116.06 → 1116.36] A lower
[1116.36 → 1116.74] Cut
[1116.74 → 1118.52] That gets
[1118.52 → 1118.92] Usually
[1118.92 → 1119.48] Countered
[1119.48 → 1119.70] By the
[1119.70 → 1120.10] Fact that
[1120.10 → 1120.50] Epic's
[1120.50 → 1121.00] Game Store
[1121.00 → 1121.80] Is on
[1121.80 → 1122.36] Open
[1122.36 → 1123.06] Platforms
[1123.06 → 1123.56] That include
[1123.56 → 1124.18] Other game
[1124.18 → 1124.52] Stores
[1124.52 → 1125.26] And that's
[1125.26 → 1125.94] Developers
[1125.94 → 1126.66] Deciding to
[1126.66 → 1127.10] Take that
[1127.10 → 1127.40] Deal
[1127.40 → 1128.98] Instead of
[1128.98 → 1129.56] It being
[1129.56 → 1130.04] The only
[1130.04 → 1130.50] Potential
[1130.50 → 1130.94] Option
[1130.94 → 1132.56] So
[1132.56 → 1133.12] Things
[1133.12 → 1133.62] Change
[1133.62 → 1133.90] There
[1133.90 → 1134.34] You can't
[1134.34 → 1134.94] Side load
[1134.94 → 1135.44] Apps
[1135.44 → 1136.24] At least
[1136.24 → 1137.44] Easily
[1137.44 → 1138.12] And by
[1138.12 → 1138.48] Standard
[1138.48 → 1140.18] On to
[1140.18 → 1140.70] iPhones
[1140.70 → 1141.28] You have
[1141.28 → 1141.56] To go
[1141.56 → 1141.94] Through
[1141.94 → 1142.50] That
[1142.50 → 1143.08] App Store
[1143.08 → 1143.74] And they
[1143.74 → 1144.18] Have this
[1144.18 → 1144.88] Very
[1144.88 → 1146.08] Anti
[1146.08 → 1146.42] Old
[1146.42 → 1146.68] School
[1146.68 → 1147.08] Apple
[1147.08 → 1147.90] Totalitarian
[1147.90 → 1148.36] Grip
[1148.36 → 1149.14] On that
[1149.14 → 1149.60] App Store
[1149.60 → 1150.38] Well it
[1150.38 → 1150.92] Really depends
[1150.92 → 1151.44] On how
[1151.44 → 1151.66] You're
[1151.66 → 1151.94] Thinking
[1151.94 → 1152.36] Of the
[1152.36 → 1153.26] Monopoly
[1153.26 → 1153.54] And the
[1153.54 → 1154.02] Competition
[1154.02 → 1154.80] Because
[1154.80 → 1155.24] Apple
[1155.24 → 1155.74] Would say
[1155.74 → 1156.76] Buy an
[1156.76 → 1157.06] Android
[1157.06 → 1157.42] Phone
[1157.42 → 1158.44] But it's
[1158.44 → 1158.74] Really
[1158.74 → 1159.66] The question
[1159.66 → 1159.90] Is
[1159.90 → 1160.92] Is that
[1160.92 → 1161.08] A
[1161.08 → 1161.38] Competing
[1161.38 → 1161.78] Product
[1161.78 → 1162.38] Or am
[1162.38 → 1162.54] I
[1162.54 → 1162.78] You know
[1162.78 → 1163.12] I've
[1163.12 → 1163.60] Decided
[1163.60 → 1164.06] I want
[1164.06 → 1164.38] An
[1164.38 → 1164.70] iPhone
[1164.70 → 1165.12] I want
[1165.12 → 1165.26] The
[1165.26 → 1165.58] iPhone
[1165.58 → 1166.14] Hardware
[1166.14 → 1167.06] And I
[1167.06 → 1167.38] Want to
[1167.38 → 1167.62] Be able
[1167.62 → 1167.88] To put
[1167.88 → 1168.12] Whatever
[1168.12 → 1168.42] App
[1168.42 → 1168.76] On there
[1168.76 → 1169.24] Or use
[1169.24 → 1169.44] Whatever
[1169.44 → 1169.94] App stores
[1169.94 → 1170.44] I want
[1170.44 → 1171.10] But it's
[1171.10 → 1171.74] An integrated
[1171.74 → 1172.16] Product
[1172.16 → 1173.14] You know
[1173.14 → 1173.54] You can't
[1173.54 → 1173.68] Really
[1173.68 → 1175.20] Take apart
[1175.20 → 1175.64] The hardware
[1175.64 → 1176.08] From the
[1176.08 → 1176.46] Software
[1176.46 → 1177.28] So it's
[1177.28 → 1177.58] Really
[1177.58 → 1177.94] Kind of
[1177.94 → 1178.30] Sticky
[1178.30 → 1178.68] Yeah
[1178.68 → 1179.20] And there's
[1179.20 → 1179.46] Also
[1179.46 → 1180.34] I don't
[1180.34 → 1180.68] Know how
[1180.68 → 1181.20] This plays
[1181.20 → 1181.60] Legally
[1181.60 → 1181.94] Or if
[1181.94 → 1182.20] It does
[1182.20 → 1182.50] At all
[1182.50 → 1183.02] But there
[1183.02 → 1183.48] Are also
[1183.48 → 1184.18] Quite a
[1184.18 → 1184.30] Few
[1184.30 → 1184.56] Different
[1184.56 → 1185.10] Situations
[1185.10 → 1185.36] I would
[1185.36 → 1185.54] Say
[1185.54 → 1186.16] Surprisingly
[1186.16 → 1186.56] Often
[1186.56 → 1186.96] On the
[1186.96 → 1187.32] Apple
[1187.32 → 1187.66] Side
[1187.66 → 1188.34] Where
[1188.34 → 1189.72] For your
[1189.72 → 1190.22] Work
[1190.22 → 1190.60] Or for
[1190.60 → 1191.00] Some other
[1191.00 → 1191.28] Reason
[1191.28 → 1191.58] You are
[1191.58 → 1192.44] Required
[1192.44 → 1192.98] To
[1192.98 → 1193.76] Have
[1193.76 → 1194.14] Apple
[1194.14 → 1194.70] Devices
[1194.70 → 1196.22] Things
[1196.22 → 1196.48] Like
[1196.48 → 1197.28] AirDrop
[1197.28 → 1197.56] And some
[1197.56 → 1197.72] Other
[1197.72 → 1198.00] Stuff
[1198.00 → 1198.28] That
[1198.28 → 1198.60] That
[1198.60 → 1199.56] That
[1199.56 → 1199.80] Can
[1199.80 → 1200.20] Simplify
[1200.20 → 1200.54] Things
[1200.54 → 1200.74] If
[1200.74 → 1201.12] Everyone
[1201.12 → 1201.34] Is
[1201.34 → 1201.56] Using
[1201.56 → 1201.74] The
[1201.74 → 1201.96] Same
[1201.96 → 1202.22] Type
[1202.22 → 1202.32] Of
[1202.32 → 1202.66] Device
[1202.66 → 1203.16] Apple
[1203.16 → 1203.28] Is
[1203.28 → 1203.54] Very
[1203.54 → 1203.78] Well
[1203.78 → 1204.06] Known
[1204.06 → 1204.52] For
[1204.52 → 1204.76] Making
[1204.76 → 1204.90] It
[1204.90 → 1205.04] So
[1205.04 → 1205.18] That
[1205.18 → 1205.40] Once
[1205.40 → 1205.50] You're
[1205.50 → 1205.66] In
[1205.66 → 1205.76] Their
[1205.76 → 1206.28] Ecosystem
[1206.28 → 1206.54] It's
[1206.54 → 1206.94] Kind of
[1206.94 → 1207.54] Frustrating
[1207.54 → 1207.78] And
[1207.78 → 1208.20] Difficult
[1208.20 → 1208.50] To
[1208.50 → 1208.92] Leave
[1208.92 → 1209.06] Their
[1209.06 → 1209.52] Ecosystem
[1209.52 → 1209.80] Because
[1209.80 → 1210.12] Everything
[1210.12 → 1210.54] You have
[1210.54 → 1210.76] Just
[1210.76 → 1211.00] Works
[1211.00 → 1211.22] With
[1211.22 → 1211.46] Each
[1211.46 → 1211.66] Other
[1211.66 → 1211.80] And
[1211.80 → 1212.00] Nothing
[1212.00 → 1212.32] Else
[1212.32 → 1213.34] Not
[1213.34 → 1213.52] Only
[1213.52 → 1213.76] That
[1213.76 → 1214.24] From
[1214.24 → 1214.48] The
[1214.48 → 1214.84] Individual
[1214.84 → 1215.14] Level
[1215.14 → 1215.34] But
[1215.34 → 1215.52] As
[1215.52 → 1215.64] You
[1215.64 → 1215.88] Alluded
[1215.88 → 1216.14] To
[1216.14 → 1216.54] There's
[1216.54 → 1216.64] A

[1219.28 → 1219.50] Only
[1219.50 → 1219.78] Use
[1219.78 → 1220.40] iMessage
[1220.40 → 1220.80] Well
[1220.80 → 1221.22] It
[1221.22 → 1221.36] Might
[1221.36 → 1221.46] Be
[1221.46 → 1221.56] A

[1252.28 → 1252.78] We
[1252.78 → 1252.94] Are
[1252.94 → 1253.22] Using

[1253.90 → 1257.42] Show
[1257.42 → 1257.64] Runner
[1257.64 → 1257.88] Okay
[1257.88 → 1258.22] Sure
[1258.22 → 1258.48] Yeah
[1258.48 → 1258.98] My
[1258.98 → 1259.36] Mom
[1259.36 → 1259.52] Had
[1259.52 → 1259.60] To

[1259.70 → 1259.80] An
[1259.80 → 1260.04] iPhone
[1260.04 → 1261.20] Because
[1261.20 → 1261.32] They
[1261.32 → 1261.42] Were
[1261.42 → 1261.68] Using
[1261.68 → 1262.04] Like
[1262.04 → 1263.16] Some

[1263.64 → 1264.24] That

[1265.32 → 1265.76] Android
[1265.76 → 1265.98] Phones
[1265.98 → 1266.72] Don't
[1266.72 → 1266.88] And
[1266.88 → 1266.94] It
[1266.94 → 1267.04] Was
[1267.04 → 1267.16] Just
[1267.16 → 1267.38] Like

[1744.46 → 1744.60] Is
[1751.90 → 1752.06] But
[1752.06 → 1752.20] There
[1752.20 → 1752.44] Is
[1752.44 → 1753.60] Lots
[1753.60 → 1753.76] Of
[1753.76 → 1754.02] Other
[1754.02 → 1754.42] Things
[1754.42 → 1755.34] And
[1755.34 → 1755.48] I
[1755.48 → 1755.70] If
[1755.70 → 1755.80] I
[1755.80 → 1756.14] Remember
[1756.14 → 1756.48] Correctly
[1756.48 → 1756.58] It's
[1756.58 → 1756.68] Been
[1756.68 → 1756.80] A
[1756.80 → 1756.96] Long
[1756.96 → 1757.18] Time
[1757.18 → 1757.28] I
[1757.28 → 1757.40] Should
[1757.40 → 1757.48] Have
[1757.48 → 1757.66] Done
[1757.66 → 1757.82] More
[1757.82 → 1758.08] Research
[1758.08 → 1758.26] On
[1758.26 → 1758.38] This
[1758.38 → 1758.62] Before
[1758.62 → 1758.80] The
[1758.80 → 1759.00] Show
[1759.00 → 1759.14] I
[1759.14 → 1759.34] Didn't
[1759.34 → 1759.52] Actually
[1759.52 → 1759.72] Think
[1759.72 → 1759.80] I
[1759.80 → 1759.88] Was
[1759.88 → 1759.98] Going
[1759.98 → 1760.00] To
[1760.00 → 1760.10] End
[1760.10 → 1760.20] Up
[1760.20 → 1760.48] Talking
[1760.48 → 1760.74] About
[1760.74 → 1760.88] It
[1760.88 → 1762.06] But
[1762.06 → 1762.34] It's
[1762.34 → 1763.52] Relevant
[1763.52 → 1763.74] I
[1763.74 → 1763.86] Should
[1763.86 → 1763.94] Have
[1763.94 → 1764.10] Looked
[1764.10 → 1764.28] Into
[1764.28 → 1764.50] It
[1764.50 → 1765.66] If
[1765.66 → 1765.76] I
[1765.76 → 1765.94] Remember
[1765.94 → 1766.28] Correctly
[1766.28 → 1766.42] They
[1766.42 → 1766.54] Were
[1766.54 → 1766.98] Relatively
[1766.98 → 1767.44] Aggressive
[1767.44 → 1767.70] About
[1767.70 → 1767.86] Like
[1767.86 → 1768.54] Browsers
[1768.54 → 1768.72] And
[1768.72 → 1768.96] Stuff
[1768.96 → 1769.16] Like
[1769.16 → 1769.42] That
[1769.42 → 1769.82] Yeah
[1769.82 → 1770.16] There's
[1770.16 → 1770.28] A
[1770.28 → 1770.46] Big
[1781.90 → 1782.44] At
[1782.44 → 1782.74] All
[1782.74 → 1783.40] Not
[1783.40 → 1783.66] Only
[1783.66 → 1784.26] Just
[1784.26 → 1784.80] Them
[1784.80 → 1785.22] Like
[1785.22 → 1785.56] Not
[1785.56 → 1785.84] Letting
[1785.84 → 1786.00] You
[1786.00 → 1786.26] Install
[1786.26 → 1786.68] Netscape
[1786.68 → 1786.82] Or
[1786.82 → 1787.00] Whatever
[1787.00 → 1787.26] Else
[1787.26 → 1787.84] Like
[1787.84 → 1788.24] It's
[1788.24 → 1788.98] This
[1788.98 → 1789.96] Is
[1789.96 → 1791.94] Antitrust
[1791.94 → 1792.50] And
[1792.50 → 1793.22] Anti-monopoly
[1793.22 → 1793.34] And
[1793.34 → 1793.40] All
[1793.40 → 1793.50] This
[1793.50 → 1793.58] Kind
[1793.58 → 1793.64] Of
[1793.64 → 1793.78] Stuff
[1793.78 → 1794.06] Is
[1794.06 → 1794.24] A
[1794.24 → 1794.54] Really
[1794.54 → 1794.86] Really
[1794.86 → 1795.18] Big
[1795.18 → 1795.50] Thing
[1795.50 → 1795.70] In
[1795.70 → 1795.84] The
[1795.84 → 1796.18] U.S.
[1796.18 → 1796.70] That
[1796.70 → 1797.12] Hasn't
[1797.12 → 1797.38] Really
[1797.38 → 1797.64] Been
[1797.64 → 1798.06] Used
[1798.06 → 1798.30] Very
[1798.30 → 1798.60] Much
[1798.60 → 1799.38] Since
[1799.38 → 1799.94] United
[1799.94 → 1800.28] States
[1800.28 → 1800.60] Versus
[1800.60 → 1800.92] Microsoft
[1800.92 → 1801.28] Court
[1801.28 → 1803.20] And
[1803.20 → 1804.24] Maybe
[1804.24 → 1805.62] This
[1805.62 → 1805.96] Will
[1805.96 → 1806.60] Bring
[1806.60 → 1806.82] That
[1806.82 → 1807.18] Back
[1807.18 → 1807.82] I
[1807.82 → 1808.18] Would
[1808.18 → 1808.42] Not
[1808.42 → 1808.60] Be
[1808.60 → 1809.06] Surprised
[1809.06 → 1809.38] At
[1809.38 → 1809.68] All
[1809.68 → 1810.14] If
[1810.14 → 1810.32] This
[1810.32 → 1810.54] Went
[1810.54 → 1810.88] Supreme
[1810.88 → 1811.12] Court
[1811.12 → 1811.42] Level
[1811.42 → 1812.60] Oh
[1812.60 → 1812.82] Yeah
[1812.82 → 1813.36] Yeah
[1813.36 → 1813.56] Yeah
[1813.56 → 1813.64] Yeah
[1813.64 → 1813.80] Like
[1813.80 → 1814.00] This
[1814.00 → 1814.16] Is
[1814.16 → 1814.32] Gonna
[1814.32 → 1814.62] Go
[1814.62 → 1815.62] Huge
[1815.62 → 1816.10] Because
[1816.10 → 1816.30] This
[1816.30 → 1816.46] Is
[1816.46 → 1816.72] Talking
[1816.72 → 1817.10] About
[1817.10 → 1817.32] The
[1817.32 → 1817.64] Max
[1817.64 → 1817.84] They're
[1817.84 → 1817.94] Gonna
[1817.94 → 1818.30] Appeal
[1818.30 → 1818.60] As
[1818.60 → 1818.74] Far
[1818.74 → 1818.86] As
[1818.86 → 1818.96] They
[1818.96 → 1819.22] Can
[1819.22 → 1819.82] What
[1819.82 → 1819.92] I
[1819.92 → 1820.06] Think
[1820.06 → 1820.20] Is
[1820.20 → 1820.40] Really
[1820.40 → 1820.70] Interesting
[1820.70 → 1820.94] About
[1820.94 → 1821.06] It
[1821.06 → 1821.26] Is
[1821.26 → 1821.56] How
[1821.56 → 1822.48] It's
[1822.48 → 1822.72] Like
[1822.72 → 1822.90] A
[1822.90 → 1823.26] Gray
[1823.26 → 1823.56] Area
[1823.56 → 1823.78] Like
[1823.78 → 1823.98] You're
[1823.98 → 1824.48] Any
[1824.48 → 1824.98] Successful
[1824.98 → 1825.30] Company
[1825.30 → 1825.52] It
[1825.52 → 1825.72] Seems
[1825.72 → 1825.84] To
[1840.88 → 1846.76] And
[1846.76 → 1847.34] Yeah
[1847.34 → 1850.12] Comment
[1850.12 → 1851.36] To
[1852.56 → 1855.36] On
[1855.36 → 1863.50] Even when you are the innovator who makes something completely brand new, you only get about two years of reaping the profits before the competition comes.
[1864.10 → 1867.68] And you have to put your prices down, and then it's a fully competitive market.
[1867.82 → 1868.78] It's a commodity, right?
[1869.64 → 1872.36] In the best case scenario, you only get two years is what he said.
[1872.44 → 1875.00] Well, these app stores have had longer than two years.
[1875.00 → 1887.88] And I think that's interesting to me is at first, these massive profits of 30% of the labour of all the apps on your platform, that's your reward for making something so awesome as the app store.
[1888.56 → 1895.12] And you can't fault these people for designing these platforms and these pay structures that benefit them.
[1895.32 → 1897.80] And in some sense, they deserve the reward.
[1897.80 → 1904.36] However, when they get so successful, at some point, now we think of them as utilities.
[1905.84 → 1910.84] Now that there are so many billions of devices, it's just not fair anymore.
[1911.24 → 1915.16] And they have to like, it's a whole paradigm shift.
[1915.48 → 1922.08] Where now, it's like, I don't want to pay for having, I don't know, like the fire department come to my house.
[1922.16 → 1924.12] It's just, we all get it.
[1924.12 → 1930.72] Apparently, chat does not like that guy that you mentioned.
[1931.32 → 1932.46] Yeah, it's...
[1932.46 → 1932.92] Oh, Peter Thiel?
[1933.16 → 1933.36] Yeah.
[1933.44 → 1937.62] Oh, he's famously like the only libertarian in Silicon Valley or something.
[1937.74 → 1941.00] I'm not saying he's not a turd, but the book is pretty cool.
[1942.62 → 1943.46] Yeah, I don't know.
[1943.60 → 1944.98] It's fascinating.
[1945.46 → 1949.38] There's a lot here that I think is going to be above our heads.
[1949.38 → 1955.48] I think there's a lot here that's going to be above almost everyone's heads that is at least watching this.
[1955.76 → 1958.84] Because this is going to go very far and very deep.
[1960.48 → 1961.28] Hey, if you...
[1961.28 → 1970.20] On that note, if you want to hear from someone whose head this is not over, there is a really awesome podcast slash blog from a guy named Ben Thompson.
[1970.70 → 1972.38] His blog is called Strut Hear.
[1973.08 → 1974.80] It's like strategy and tech together.
[1974.80 → 1978.32] And the podcast is called Exponent.
[1978.60 → 1979.98] And they talk about this stuff a lot.
[1980.06 → 1981.40] And it's a really high level discussion.
[1981.52 → 1981.88] Check it out.
[1982.04 → 1982.12] Cool.
[1983.14 → 1987.16] But yeah, it's going to be really, really exciting to follow where this goes.
[1987.70 → 1988.98] Especially from Flow plane's side.
[1989.00 → 1991.02] Because right now, we are screwed.
[1991.60 → 1994.22] There's like basically nothing we can do.
[1994.30 → 1996.58] We're being stiff-armed out of the App Store.
[1996.58 → 2003.28] Unless we have the only payment option on the App Store be Apple Payments.
[2003.44 → 2006.00] We can't make Apple Payments charge more.
[2006.18 → 2011.64] When we established our company, we tried to have very competitive rates.
[2011.70 → 2012.52] Tried to be thin margin.
[2012.62 → 2013.22] All that kind of stuff.
[2013.36 → 2017.06] We don't have the ability to just take 30% out of everything.
[2017.60 → 2019.06] Therefore, we just can't.
[2020.66 → 2021.90] Like we are just stuck.
[2021.90 → 2025.80] What we do have the ability to do is to read our sponsors.
[2026.24 → 2026.66] We do.
[2027.02 → 2027.36] Yes.
[2027.50 → 2028.32] Let's jump to that.
[2029.04 → 2029.40] Displate.
[2029.56 → 2032.32] Displate is a magnet-mounted metal print.
[2032.58 → 2036.08] It's basically like art that you can easily sunk onto your wall.
[2036.58 → 2040.94] And if you get a new one, you just pop that one off by the magnet and slap your new one on there.
[2041.00 → 2043.54] They're durable, and you don't need any power tools to hang them.
[2043.54 → 2047.54] With over 800,000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles and influences,
[2048.34 → 2050.24] they're pretty awesome and there's something for everyone.
[2050.34 → 2051.28] You can browse their store.
[2051.28 → 2053.52] I think there's some user-generated content on there.
[2054.48 → 2057.84] And a lot of it is like nerd-themed and fantasy-themed stuff.
[2057.92 → 2058.56] So it's very cool.
[2058.62 → 2061.06] They have some Cyberpunk 2077 ones too.
[2063.14 → 2065.84] They plant one tree for each Displate purchased.
[2066.36 → 2069.04] And we even have our own line of displaces.
[2069.62 → 2071.30] One of them has me in it.
[2071.34 → 2073.04] I'm holding a goddamn duck.
[2073.26 → 2073.84] It's awesome.
[2074.24 → 2077.78] So head to our link below and use code WAN, W-A-N-W-A-N,
[2077.78 → 2080.28] to save 15% on your Displate today.
[2081.28 → 2082.52] Yeah.
[2083.02 → 2085.68] And then PIA.
[2086.68 → 2089.70] I love the PIA spots because we can basically say whatever.
[2092.04 → 2092.48] VPNs.
[2092.98 → 2094.28] You often want one.
[2094.36 → 2095.20] You often need one.
[2095.36 → 2096.26] You're often interested in one.
[2096.26 → 2096.84] Welcome if you got them.
[2096.84 → 2098.36] You should check out PIA.
[2098.92 → 2100.40] We've been working with them for a while.
[2100.46 → 2101.58] They have no bandwidth caps.
[2102.00 → 2103.96] They now feature WireGuard, which is cool.
[2104.12 → 2110.48] Private Internet Access has access to 3,300 servers in 30 different countries.
[2110.48 → 2113.92] They have configurable encryption within an internet kill switch.
[2114.16 → 2115.52] I like the internet kill switch option.
[2115.52 → 2126.12] Basically, if your connection to PIA gets interrupted, instead of just bypassing going back to your ISP, it will just kill everything.
[2126.68 → 2129.82] Therefore, nothing will flow through your ISP, which is cool.
[2129.82 → 2133.70] You can try it risk-free with their 30-day money-back guarantee.
[2134.20 → 2141.68] You can connect up to 10 devices at once with clients for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.
[2142.40 → 2142.48] Check it out.
[2142.48 → 2143.00] Is that new?
[2143.10 → 2145.90] Because the copy used to say five devices at once.
[2145.90 → 2146.48] I thought it was five.
[2146.48 → 2148.34] It says 10 in this current copy.
[2149.42 → 2150.40] Maybe they doubled it.
[2150.60 → 2151.06] I don't know.
[2151.76 → 2153.02] But yeah, it used to say five.
[2153.50 → 2161.68] It would be fascinating if you had 10 devices, and you just didn't have them in your hands all the time and other people had them.
[2161.84 → 2162.50] That would be crazy.
[2163.04 → 2168.96] Check it out at lmg.com slash Pagan or Pagan.
[2169.92 → 2174.34] We're also brought to you by Messi, particularly their new weekend shoe.
[2174.34 → 2176.58] It's a pretty nice model, actually.
[2177.04 → 2178.04] Model of shoe, that is.
[2179.00 → 2179.54] Messi Footwear.
[2179.66 → 2182.98] They're known for making comfortable shoes that are light and, most importantly, waterproof.
[2183.18 → 2185.16] Perfect if you live in the Pacific Northwest like we do.
[2185.74 → 2188.48] You can walk on almost any train while keeping your feet dry.
[2188.60 → 2190.62] They don't look like weird dad shoes.
[2190.70 → 2191.86] They just look pretty stylish.
[2192.16 → 2193.64] I have a pair myself, actually.
[2194.06 → 2194.58] Two pairs.
[2195.94 → 2197.22] This new weekend shoe.
[2197.28 → 2198.80] You can really dress it up or dress it down.
[2199.00 → 2199.86] It's pretty sweet.
[2200.42 → 2203.74] And you can reserve a pair right now for five bucks.
[2203.74 → 2206.42] Once they're ready to ship, you just pay the balance.
[2206.62 → 2212.02] And that five bucks actually gets donated to a charity, I believe, for mental health awareness.
[2212.28 → 2213.02] So, like, awesome.
[2213.82 → 2214.84] Yeah, they're an awesome company.
[2214.94 → 2216.82] The shoes themselves are actually 100% vegan.
[2217.04 → 2219.32] So, who wants their shoes to harm animals?
[2219.48 → 2221.80] Even if you like eating meat, does your shoe need to?
[2222.06 → 2222.92] No, it doesn't.
[2223.02 → 2223.70] So, that's great.
[2224.06 → 2226.78] Check them out at Bessi.com slash Linus Tech Tips.
[2227.82 → 2228.22] Okay.
[2228.56 → 2228.90] Awesome.
[2228.90 → 2235.16] I had some people comment while we were doing that, like, why don't you just make, like, the Safari version better?
[2235.32 → 2235.52] Whatever.
[2236.02 → 2238.62] Safari's, like, I don't remember all the details.
[2239.00 → 2240.36] Terrible at video stuff.
[2240.60 → 2243.20] And has a lot of, like, compatibility issues with what we're doing.
[2243.78 → 2244.30] Blah, blah, blah.
[2244.78 → 2245.36] It sucks.
[2246.22 → 2247.54] We need the app.
[2247.96 → 2248.48] We need an app.
[2249.06 → 2249.72] Gotta have an app.
[2250.58 → 2251.68] Let's talk about Starlink, dude.
[2251.90 → 2252.82] Yes, let's do it.
[2253.22 → 2253.66] It's fun.
[2254.32 → 2254.74] Pissing off astronomers.
[2254.74 → 2255.66] We like internet, don't you?
[2255.68 → 2255.90] It's fun.
[2256.30 → 2257.60] Everybody likes internet, man.
[2258.86 → 2263.76] I think this is going to be kind of amazing.
[2263.96 → 2264.82] But, yeah, let's talk about this.
[2265.10 → 2267.44] Starlink beta tests and speeds.
[2267.44 → 2272.76] The first speeds for SpaceX's Starlink satellite broadband service have been revealed.
[2273.54 → 2282.62] Using Okla speed test app, Starlink beta users found speeds range from 36 megabits per second to 60 megabits per second on download.
[2282.62 → 2288.40] And 5 megabits per second to 17.7 megabits per second on upload.
[2288.54 → 2291.98] The latency was as low as 31 milliseconds.
[2292.18 → 2295.66] Don't know how high it went to, but it went as low as that.
[2296.16 → 2301.84] So, these users, by the way, are mostly in the northern United States and southern Canada.
[2302.48 → 2306.26] I mean, if they're in Canada at all, they're probably in southern Canada.
[2306.48 → 2306.58] Yeah.
[2306.78 → 2310.60] If you look at a population map of Canada, we're all along the U.S. border.
[2310.80 → 2311.58] Almost entirely.
[2311.58 → 2312.02] Yeah.
[2314.02 → 2314.54] Yeah.
[2314.66 → 2322.82] The 20 gigabyte plus bandwidth of a satellite can support only so much bandwidth in a given 50 kilometers by 50 kilometre cell.
[2322.96 → 2327.90] That bandwidth is roughly 500 megabits per second for each cell maximum.
[2328.74 → 2329.90] Pricing for the service is not.
[2330.02 → 2330.14] Sorry.
[2330.36 → 2331.02] Go for it.
[2331.12 → 2333.38] So, that thing is clutch.
[2333.38 → 2334.62] So, there's a tweet here.
[2334.62 → 2339.90] Because some of these speeds look a lot slower than what Elon kind of promised.
[2340.28 → 2353.84] So, if you go back and look at the historical record on Twitter, there is a person named at Test Latino saying, you know, if this was like as good as or even half as good as fibre, that'd be great.
[2353.84 → 2355.90] I'm getting 900 megabits per second.
[2356.04 → 2357.82] If I got half of that, I'd be happy.
[2358.38 → 2366.52] And then Elon says the peak rate of about half of that for version one of the system would be about that.
[2366.52 → 2369.62] So, he's saying it would be about 450 megabits per second.
[2370.32 → 2375.08] And now we're looking at the recorded speeds from the beta that are like 36 megabits per second up to 60.
[2375.34 → 2377.30] Well, that's a long way off of 450.
[2377.30 → 2384.44] The reason is that each one of these satellites, I guess, it services, like you said, a 50k by 50k cell.
[2385.00 → 2388.90] And the bandwidth is divided among all the users in that cell.
[2389.08 → 2398.68] So, theoretically, Elon wasn't yanking your chain when he said you could get that if you're the only person in that 2,500 square kilometre cell.
[2398.76 → 2402.80] And he did say it's heavily dependent on users per cell in that tweet.
[2402.80 → 2406.20] He also said they're aiming for a latency of under 20 milliseconds.
[2407.92 → 2410.18] This is all, we're not fully set up yet.
[2410.26 → 2416.80] They're still launching more satellites that should hopefully kind of divide up those users per cell.
[2417.08 → 2418.70] Maybe there'll be more than one satellite per cell.
[2418.88 → 2419.36] Not certain.
[2420.08 → 2422.76] Or it's more than one satellite per area thing.
[2424.80 → 2426.02] It's interesting.
[2426.24 → 2428.48] Do you think people are going to start moving out?
[2428.48 → 2436.02] Oh, do I think that more people will live in rural areas and work from home because they have fast internet out there?
[2436.50 → 2436.86] Wow.
[2437.00 → 2438.06] I never thought of that.
[2438.88 → 2439.86] That's pretty awesome.
[2440.06 → 2442.18] Because honestly, right now, like what's the benefit?
[2442.36 → 2443.64] I mean, during COVID, right?
[2443.78 → 2446.22] But like that'll pass, I guess, at some point.
[2446.38 → 2449.88] But right now, like a lot of people are just staying home anyway.
[2450.42 → 2456.38] Like you could live further out, save probably astronomical amounts.
[2456.38 → 2459.16] You can buy a house like you're a boomer.
[2459.28 → 2459.48] Yeah.
[2460.28 → 2461.78] And just live that boomer life.
[2461.96 → 2464.66] Live way further out there, have more land, etc.
[2464.82 → 2467.44] Maybe you'd be able to go outside because there won't be as many people there.
[2468.46 → 2469.22] No restaurants.
[2469.56 → 2470.92] Got to make your own avocado toast.
[2471.16 → 2471.58] Oh, no.
[2471.74 → 2472.44] Got to cook.
[2473.08 → 2475.84] We'll have robot cooks sooner than later.
[2476.36 → 2477.78] They can make you fantastic meals.
[2478.24 → 2478.54] I don't know.
[2478.62 → 2484.98] I think this is like one of the stepping stones to people spreading back out.
[2484.98 → 2491.40] Except we've had a lot of like, for quite a few years, we've had a lot of stuff that has been driving people into cities.
[2492.12 → 2495.32] And you're getting these like crazy hyper hubs of people.
[2495.96 → 2501.44] And I think this is going to be one of the there's going to be probably going to need to be quite a few things.
[2502.42 → 2506.14] But this is one of the steps if it steps far enough.
[2506.28 → 2509.64] Like the guy said, he needs about half of what his current fibre thing is doing.
[2509.64 → 2512.24] He should also have better latency, etc, etc.
[2512.24 → 2524.58] Yeah, that guy though, I don't think, I think a lot of people who right now who are in the target market for this, the people who have rural satellite internet right now, a lot of them would be happy to have 10 megabits per second.
[2525.08 → 2527.86] Or 25 would be really, 20 to 25 would be really nice.
[2527.94 → 2532.00] You could stream an HD movie while maybe browsing as well.
[2532.00 → 2539.36] So Netflix 4K requires an internet connection speed of 25 megabits per second or higher.
[2539.60 → 2541.68] I would probably lean on the or higher.
[2542.06 → 2549.46] I think if you got people to even 100, the vast majority of users would not really notice a big difference.
[2550.26 → 2551.78] Oh, most people don't even have 100.
[2552.12 → 2553.96] I mean, a lot of gamers are like, what?
[2554.02 → 2555.04] Because they all have gigabit.
[2555.04 → 2558.42] But I think I have fibre 150, 150.
[2558.66 → 2561.04] And I only have that to watch 4K Blu-ray remixes.
[2561.74 → 2563.80] Most people are totally fine with.
[2564.02 → 2572.18] If you're watching this show, and you are offended by 25 megabits per second internet speed, you are probably not an average user.
[2573.46 → 2575.48] I am rather offended by that.
[2575.52 → 2576.32] That would bother me.
[2576.48 → 2577.52] I like my fast internet.
[2577.72 → 2579.96] But I am not exactly a normal user.
[2580.48 → 2580.50] So.
[2580.82 → 2583.94] Well, you're also just not the customer for this right now in this generation.
[2583.94 → 2584.92] Exactly. I would love to be.
[2585.06 → 2586.24] I would love to move out.
[2586.72 → 2590.84] I would rather be further out.
[2590.94 → 2593.72] I would rather have a larger place for less money.
[2593.96 → 2596.24] Both of those variables at the same time would be fantastic.
[2597.56 → 2600.52] I have no personal need to live in a big city.
[2600.98 → 2601.42] But.
[2601.76 → 2606.04] I would like the entire world to be blanketed in global internet.
[2606.62 → 2608.98] That, again, becomes so good.
[2608.98 → 2610.40] And so.
[2610.72 → 2615.40] I guess it's like the return on investment has been going for so long that it's like paid for.
[2615.94 → 2619.62] And that it's just a utility and all other things just have free internet everywhere they are.
[2620.96 → 2624.58] I think that's how Elon sold the dream of this way back at the beginning.
[2624.70 → 2626.58] That got my little nerd boner going.
[2627.14 → 2630.94] Someone who's probably from British Columbia said,
[2630.94 → 2633.42] I had 50 down and 7 up with Shaw.
[2633.82 → 2636.28] Just got Telus Fibre one gig up and down.
[2636.62 → 2638.24] Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[2638.52 → 2640.22] It's the same LOL.
[2643.34 → 2644.00] Well, yeah.
[2644.06 → 2646.16] If you have gigabits, you need to use it, right?
[2646.20 → 2652.22] You need to have your partner watching a 4K movie in the living room while you're gaming in the office.
[2652.22 → 2660.14] Or have like large data file transfers often kind of in and out or something like that.
[2660.24 → 2665.16] Like there are other things, but it's usually relatively specialized use cases.
[2665.34 → 2673.28] Or it's worth it to you to spend like three times as much to get that Steam game downloaded half an hour faster.
[2673.58 → 2674.60] Or something.
[2674.78 → 2675.38] I don't know.
[2675.56 → 2676.80] You know what actually was interesting?
[2676.80 → 2682.52] And I wish Telus, our telco here, had called me and been like,
[2682.58 → 2683.74] Hey, we can do this for you.
[2683.80 → 2684.64] But they never did.
[2685.12 → 2686.70] I had a lesser plan.
[2687.20 → 2689.08] It was Fibre, but it was the cheapest one.
[2689.14 → 2690.56] It was like $25 or something.
[2691.26 → 2694.52] And that had a data cap on it.
[2694.68 → 2698.74] Like there was a number of gigabytes per month that if you went over, you got an overage fee.
[2699.10 → 2703.62] And we were consistently going over because my wife was on Madly, and she would just listen to music all day.
[2703.92 → 2705.44] She'd listen to music on YouTube.
[2705.44 → 2707.70] So she's streaming video all day, right?
[2708.00 → 2713.08] So we keep going over and every day it's like 15 extra or every month is about an extra $15 charge.
[2713.28 → 2716.64] So then I call them and I decide that I want to upgrade to $150, $150.
[2717.16 → 2724.22] The price difference there, when you include the fact that I was getting an overage every month, I was paying the same.
[2724.50 → 2734.94] I like 5X my internet speed and paid the same because at this new tier of being faster, there was no limit.
[2734.94 → 2735.62] It's unlimited.
[2736.62 → 2739.10] It's like they could have just called me and be like, hey, you keep going over.
[2739.18 → 2740.70] How about we just bump you up to this?
[2741.38 → 2742.24] Why would they do that?
[2742.32 → 2743.86] They actually did do that for me.
[2744.90 → 2745.62] Oh, nice.
[2746.62 → 2749.52] Tell us has been super nice to me.
[2749.94 → 2751.12] I don't know why.
[2751.32 → 2757.46] I think it's like every two years, roughly, I get a call, and they're like, hey, we're going to upgrade everything you have.
[2757.46 → 2759.76] And you're going to pay less or the same amount.
[2760.00 → 2760.86] And I'm like, all right.
[2761.84 → 2762.24] Thanks.
[2762.70 → 2763.10] Bye.
[2763.82 → 2764.78] That I picked up today.
[2765.00 → 2765.66] That's pretty much.
[2765.78 → 2768.04] Yeah, that's about how far it goes.
[2768.26 → 2770.62] It's not even like an extensive conversation.
[2770.72 → 2774.42] It's usually over in like a couple of minutes and my internet speed is just like faster and things are maybe cheaper.
[2774.50 → 2774.82] I don't know.
[2775.16 → 2776.30] It's like, okay, sweet.
[2776.30 → 2788.30] I understand that this does not seem to be a very common occurrence for most people with ISPs, but my wired internet connection has been fantastic.
[2789.66 → 2791.32] It also just like never goes down.
[2791.48 → 2791.80] I don't know.
[2791.92 → 2794.08] I've been quite lucky in that department, I think.
[2794.76 → 2798.08] But moving on to other things.
[2798.30 → 2800.34] You want to talk about this Microsoft Surface Duo?
[2800.70 → 2801.30] Let's do it.
[2802.30 → 2802.96] Let's do it.
[2802.96 → 2805.82] I have such mixed feelings about this device.
[2806.30 → 2812.10] On the one hand, I think it's so boring because basically it's like a Samsung Galaxy Note.
[2812.96 → 2820.66] It's a big phone that opens, but it's way less cool than that because it's not one bendable OLED screen.
[2820.94 → 2824.08] It's just it opens like a book and there's just two separate screens.
[2824.38 → 2827.28] So it feels not futuristic at all.
[2827.64 → 2833.60] At the same time, it's kind of de facto as good as having one big bendable screen.
[2833.60 → 2838.70] Because when you have that big screen on the Galaxy Note, a lot of the time you're just dividing it into two anyway.
[2839.10 → 2839.20] Yeah.
[2839.36 → 2843.10] I would always divide it into two personally.
[2843.34 → 2849.34] I can understand why someone would want that if they're like, yeah, I want to watch like movies on my phone or something like that.
[2849.74 → 2850.84] I'm not going to do that.
[2850.84 → 2865.58] The reason why I would want two screens, and I'm very excited for dual screen phones is that I can have like Slack or Gmail open up on one side and be able to message people about something that I'm doing on the other side.
[2865.70 → 2867.90] That is like always what I'm going to want.
[2867.90 → 2870.70] So it doesn't bother me personally.
[2870.90 → 2876.90] Also, by the way, this is posted by Goodbyes on the forum who now has over 22,000 posts.
[2877.04 → 2877.52] That's amazing.
[2880.72 → 2886.32] But yeah, apparently Microsoft worked with they worked with Android.
[2886.32 → 2897.40] They worked with Google to collaborate and make sure that all the apps like the API was robust enough to make the experience, you know, not suck.
[2898.40 → 2903.90] And I think that's going to get more and more common because all these dual screen devices are getting more and more common.
[2903.98 → 2907.30] We're on the second generation of Galaxy Fold coming up here.
[2907.30 → 2914.60] I'm trying to figure out what the price of a Galaxy Fold Galaxy Z Fold 2 was.
[2915.22 → 2917.12] It's like twenty-four hundred bucks.
[2919.86 → 2921.50] Yeah, they're over two grand.
[2921.68 → 2922.90] They're expensive.
[2924.42 → 2924.90] Wow.
[2925.08 → 2926.26] OK, I can't find it.
[2926.46 → 2928.14] Let's be two thousand.
[2929.70 → 2930.14] Oh, no, no.
[2930.14 → 2930.88] It's right here.
[2931.56 → 2932.24] No, no, no.
[2932.24 → 2935.76] This device is going to be fourteen hundred US dollars for one hundred twenty-eight gigabyte.
[2935.76 → 2937.76] It's one hundred dollars more for the 256.
[2938.22 → 2944.88] And for reference, the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the first one was released with a price tag of one thousand nine hundred and eighty.
[2945.18 → 2947.42] So if you're thinking it's over two grand.
[2949.12 → 2955.42] The Microsoft Surface Duo could be like half the price, and you're still getting a dual screen phone.
[2955.54 → 2957.18] The Fold, I believe, is triple screen.
[2958.72 → 2960.54] Yeah, there's an outer screen.
[2960.54 → 2964.56] Yeah. So like there's a lot more to it, and it has the like the fluid.
[2964.82 → 2966.66] The two screens look like one when you open it.
[2966.68 → 2968.42] Like it's super, super fancy, super nice.
[2968.54 → 2971.58] You're mostly paying for that bendable OLED screen.
[2971.70 → 2973.60] And also it had like seven cameras.
[2974.16 → 2976.28] It's got it's there's that phone is crazy.
[2976.54 → 2981.12] But if you want a dual screen phone, and you want the productivity that comes with it, you can get.
[2981.12 → 2987.08] Kind of most of it for way less of the price by going this direction.
[2987.34 → 2988.30] Fourteen hundred dollars.
[2988.42 → 2991.36] It's still an insane amount of money, just to be clear.
[2991.58 → 2994.92] But compare that to like the Samsung Note 20.
[2995.40 → 2996.70] It's like the same price.
[2996.84 → 2996.98] Yeah.
[2997.88 → 2998.58] I don't know.
[2998.68 → 3000.08] I think this is actually pretty interesting.
[3000.38 → 3003.46] I think personally that people should look at this more seriously.
[3003.46 → 3006.64] It's its really large.
[3007.20 → 3009.56] Each one of the individual screens is huge.
[3010.48 → 3014.62] The battery is only three thousand five hundred and seventy-seven million amp hours.
[3014.82 → 3017.58] I think that puppy is going to die quick with two screens.
[3017.66 → 3018.44] That is a little disappointing.
[3018.56 → 3019.46] I didn't look into the battery.
[3019.64 → 3021.06] Are they OLED screens?
[3021.96 → 3023.38] Are they at least like efficient?
[3025.86 → 3027.68] The other thing is they save cost.
[3028.08 → 3031.24] OK, they save cost because they only have one camera.
[3031.24 → 3038.00] So if you want to take a selfie versus pointing outward, you just flip the phone around, which I think is actually so much better.
[3038.40 → 3047.20] I don't like that the Galaxy Fold has a notch disrupting its giant screen just to take selfies when I like it already has an outer screen.
[3047.40 → 3048.10] It has a screen on the other side.
[3048.20 → 3048.34] Yeah.
[3049.06 → 3049.28] Yeah.
[3049.86 → 3051.02] Just use the other camera.
[3051.28 → 3051.78] Yeah, I agree.
[3052.62 → 3053.04] I don't know.
[3053.20 → 3056.82] I'm the battery is a big concern.
[3057.04 → 3058.30] That's not a huge battery.
[3058.30 → 3061.22] It says dual battery.
[3061.36 → 3062.16] Is there two of them?
[3063.26 → 3069.00] Well, I think what that means is they've split the battery so that there is one on either half of the device.
[3070.14 → 3076.34] You know, but I don't know if that's implying that it's its thirty-five hundred seventy-seven times two.
[3078.38 → 3079.64] I don't think so.
[3079.86 → 3081.34] If it was, that'd be cool.
[3081.34 → 3084.80] But I think they would say that.
[3085.78 → 3087.58] Well, the notes don't say it anyway.
[3087.94 → 3088.14] Yeah.
[3088.50 → 3089.76] Six gigabytes of RAM.
[3089.98 → 3090.42] Not a lot.
[3091.84 → 3101.84] No, but like, again, I this don't seem like a think we need another category of users for phones personally, because there's like average whatever.
[3101.84 → 3106.34] You just have a phone, and you use it for like texting and maybe some games and stuff.
[3106.50 → 3110.98] And then there's like power users, which is what people use that term for a long time.
[3111.16 → 3116.22] I think there's like power users and now maybe like productivity users is maybe a different category.
[3116.46 → 3118.80] Because like for me, to be completely honest.
[3120.18 → 3127.26] I would have called myself a power user before I did more heavy things on my phone than I think most people did now.
[3127.42 → 3128.08] Probably not.
[3128.08 → 3131.16] Spend most of my time on my phone in Slack, Gmail and Twitter.
[3131.96 → 3133.72] Does this really change the game, though?
[3133.80 → 3138.32] Because I feel like the reason that you don't use your phone, it's not because of screen size.
[3138.44 → 3140.00] To me, it's because of interface.
[3140.58 → 3144.92] It's like I try to operate a spreadsheet with like tapping on the phone.
[3144.98 → 3145.94] It's just too annoying.
[3146.06 → 3147.06] You need a keyboard and mouse.
[3147.06 → 3150.18] It changes the game for me when I don't have the option of something else.
[3151.24 → 3152.90] I love desktops.
[3153.48 → 3154.64] Huge fan of desktops.
[3154.64 → 3158.76] Like in terms of PC stuff, I don't even screw laptops.
[3158.94 → 3160.20] I love desktops.
[3160.42 → 3165.86] I would massively prefer using a desktop over like anything else pretty much all the time.
[3165.98 → 3177.42] But if I'm out somewhere and something happens, I would love to be able to open something out of my pocket and immediately be more productive than I could have been with my like Pixel 2.
[3177.42 → 3180.34] By having two screens and being able to do all this other kind of stuff.
[3180.34 → 3186.62] And with 6 gigs of RAM, I would be able to accomplish all the things that personally I would do.
[3186.80 → 3195.54] And I think there are a lot of users in that category that are going to power use their phone, but not for like games.
[3195.54 → 3202.62] And if you're not playing like games and stuff, 6 gigs of RAM is probably fine.
[3203.14 → 3205.18] You're not going to burn that battery life as fast.
[3205.30 → 3213.92] I'm still disappointed in the battery life because for me, like if something is going down, I might have to have the phone open, both screens on for a very extended period of time.
[3213.92 → 3218.24] And just having the screens on is going to burn that battery really fast, even though they are all in.
[3218.24 → 3223.68] I feel like you don't you want the RAM because you're going to be opening multiple apps, and you're going to have two of them open at the same time.
[3223.78 → 3225.44] You kind of want to just have as much memory.
[3225.90 → 3231.64] Having like Gmail, Twitter, Slack, that isn't going to fill that up way too fast.
[3233.72 → 3234.64] Like how much?
[3234.82 → 3235.52] Give me one second.
[3236.14 → 3238.28] You know what this would be really handy for?
[3238.28 → 3246.38] When you're on a website filling out a form, and you don't trust that website, you know that if you navigate away, it's going to refresh, and it's going to be empty.
[3246.68 → 3246.80] Yeah.
[3247.00 → 3250.20] And you get to a part of that form that you don't have the answer to.
[3250.30 → 3254.92] So you need to switch apps to like to go to your contacts to look up a zip code or something like that.
[3255.00 → 3255.96] Then you return to it.
[3256.00 → 3256.54] It's gone.
[3256.84 → 3258.58] On this phone, you can just leave it open.
[3259.14 → 3265.84] Leave it open over here and then do all the research you need to on the other panel and fill out that form over time without losing your session.
[3265.84 → 3272.84] So my current phone, which I don't have memory issues with, and I do.
[3273.62 → 3275.02] Is that a Pixel 2 XL?
[3275.14 → 3276.36] Pixel 2 XL, four gigs.
[3278.60 → 3279.18] All right.
[3279.56 → 3282.76] I'm not saying like, oh my goodness, this is an amazing phone.
[3282.92 → 3284.34] This is going to change the game for everyone.
[3284.58 → 3286.04] This is the best thing that's ever happened to phone.
[3286.20 → 3286.84] Not at all.
[3286.94 → 3290.30] But I do think there are definitely users that would benefit from it.
[3290.30 → 3295.66] I think it hurts a little bit not having the single screen.
[3296.72 → 3298.24] Like if you close the phone.
[3298.24 → 3298.58] You mean on the outside?
[3298.80 → 3299.18] Yeah.
[3299.70 → 3300.46] For sure.
[3300.66 → 3305.42] Because there are quite a few times when I would probably only be able to like one hand the phone.
[3305.94 → 3311.74] And being forced to, as far as I can tell, probably use the phone with two hands is going to be a big detractor.
[3311.84 → 3315.10] That might be enough to make it so that I wouldn't get this device.
[3315.10 → 3316.40] Or a watch.
[3317.00 → 3319.40] If you combo that with a watch, that could be nice.
[3319.64 → 3319.70] True.
[3319.88 → 3320.40] That's interesting.
[3320.58 → 3321.28] Because then you know.
[3321.80 → 3328.00] Because Linus said when he was daily driving the Fold that it made him want to take his phone out of his pocket less.
[3328.20 → 3330.94] Because it was such a commitment to take it out and open it.
[3331.42 → 3332.58] That he used his phone less.
[3332.88 → 3334.44] But he also uses a watch, right?
[3334.50 → 3337.32] So if your watch is going off like, oh, that's just a casual text.
[3337.44 → 3337.88] Clear that.
[3338.02 → 3339.18] Don't need to open my phone for that.
[3340.60 → 3340.96] Yeah.
[3341.12 → 3342.22] It's kind of a good little synergy.
[3342.22 → 3345.68] That's potentially more of an investment though if you don't already have a watch.
[3346.26 → 3352.36] And we're already looking at a $1,400 device which is to a certain degree a compromise.
[3352.70 → 3359.70] Because you're not getting that triple screen, more features, one fluid display, Fold.
[3360.00 → 3362.26] That being said, that Fold is at an astronomical price.
[3362.50 → 3367.06] If you did add the watch to it, I'm certain it's still going to be a cheaper overall price.
[3367.96 → 3368.70] I don't know.
[3368.70 → 3372.02] All I'm saying is I'm fairly certain there is a market for this.
[3372.80 → 3373.64] This watch, bro.
[3374.06 → 3374.76] Last gen.
[3374.98 → 3376.58] I just picked it up on Facebook Marketplace.
[3376.72 → 3377.92] $140 Canadian dollars.
[3378.18 → 3384.22] I think if you're in the market for a $1,500 phone, you can just spend some cash and get a basic watch.
[3384.48 → 3389.56] Do you think that the customer for this phone is the same customer as the Galaxy Fold?
[3390.10 → 3390.40] No.
[3391.86 → 3393.18] That's what I'm trying to establish.
[3393.36 → 3395.52] The Fold customer is actually, it's more about status.
[3395.52 → 3398.28] I think the Fold is style.
[3398.46 → 3399.26] I think it's status.
[3399.44 → 3400.54] It looks nicer.
[3401.02 → 3402.66] Sorry, Microsoft, but it just does.
[3404.80 → 3406.28] It looks nicer.
[3406.56 → 3407.76] It kind of does more.
[3407.76 → 3417.68] The Microsoft Duo, you can see more of the mechanical nature of the phone.
[3418.20 → 3419.86] The bezels are bigger.
[3420.20 → 3421.66] It looks a little chunkier.
[3422.10 → 3425.08] It looks like it might potentially be a little bit more durable.
[3426.06 → 3427.06] It's a little nerdier.
[3427.28 → 3427.54] Yeah.
[3427.74 → 3429.44] It's not as flashy.
[3429.78 → 3431.76] It's not as sexy, if I want to use that term.
[3431.76 → 3435.30] I see it as like a small business owner's phone.
[3435.34 → 3436.12] Yes, exactly.
[3437.54 → 3438.82] It's more utilitarian.
[3438.82 → 3441.40] The Fold is more like a successful real estate or car sales.
[3441.72 → 3441.90] Yeah.
[3442.56 → 3442.92] Yeah.
[3444.20 → 3444.64] Exactly.
[3445.02 → 3447.02] I think there is a different market for it.
[3447.10 → 3448.58] I think you're going for a different style.
[3449.28 → 3451.52] I think you're going into it for a different reason.
[3452.04 → 3457.00] I think you're both probably power users to a certain degree.
[3457.90 → 3459.00] You might be different kinds.
[3459.00 → 3466.18] You might be the same kind, but if you're the same kind of power user, it's probably going
[3466.18 → 3469.64] to be leaning on the other one for style or the convenience of the single screen.
[3469.76 → 3474.48] And you can afford the like $800 more, probably US.
[3474.60 → 3477.90] So that's astronomical for that like essentially single screen.
[3478.54 → 3479.98] Instead of just buying a second phone.
[3480.10 → 3480.60] Or a watch.
[3480.80 → 3482.54] Just buy a completely second phone.
[3482.76 → 3483.80] It could probably be better.
[3483.96 → 3484.92] There's my third screen.
[3485.04 → 3485.26] Boom.
[3487.06 → 3487.46] Yeah.
[3487.52 → 3487.84] I don't know.
[3487.84 → 3489.62] I think they're both very interesting devices.
[3490.06 → 3493.60] I hope the Surface Duo does not get ignored because I think there's definitely a market
[3493.60 → 3494.10] for it.
[3495.38 → 3500.98] But Microsoft devices seem to kind of be forgotten in a lot of conversations.
[3501.18 → 3502.44] Not in the laptop category.
[3502.96 → 3503.20] True.
[3503.82 → 3504.06] True.
[3504.16 → 3504.62] They're awesome.
[3505.04 → 3505.14] Yeah.
[3505.20 → 3506.68] Surface devices have been pretty cool.
[3507.04 → 3508.48] This is not a Windows phone.
[3508.92 → 3510.02] It's a Microsoft phone.
[3510.14 → 3510.34] Yes.
[3511.08 → 3511.32] Yeah.
[3512.22 → 3512.50] It's going to be.
[3512.50 → 3516.84] Well, we're definitely going to cover it as soon as we can on LTT and Short Circuit, probably.
[3517.00 → 3518.42] So hopefully it fares pretty well.
[3518.58 → 3519.64] I hope it does too.
[3519.72 → 3520.18] For chats.
[3521.12 → 3521.48] Yes.
[3521.54 → 3522.66] But I can't see them.
[3524.18 → 3524.52] Oh.
[3525.28 → 3526.22] Well, neither can I.
[3526.22 → 3527.70] So.
[3527.70 → 3527.74] So.
[3529.00 → 3531.16] Is Jake still watching?
[3531.38 → 3533.40] Can he like copy and paste some or something?
[3534.30 → 3534.68] No.
[3536.68 → 3539.66] I have no access to the YouTube dashboard.
[3539.88 → 3540.98] Is he not here?
[3542.28 → 3544.04] Because I think he would have to end the stream.
[3544.22 → 3544.54] It's 630.
[3545.10 → 3545.40] Yeah.
[3546.30 → 3548.62] I can't end the YouTube stream.
[3548.64 → 3551.22] It's the stream that never ends.
[3551.98 → 3552.74] Because I can.
[3552.90 → 3553.34] So I can.
[3554.14 → 3555.96] We can effectively say the show is over.
[3556.06 → 3556.24] And here.
[3556.24 → 3558.24] I'll roll the intro.
[3559.94 → 3561.50] I can walk over to my desktop.
[3562.88 → 3563.36] Oh.
[3564.32 → 3564.98] There we go.
[3566.86 → 3567.82] Bye, everyone.
[3569.44 → 3569.96] I can.
[3570.68 → 3572.36] I want to.
[3572.36 → 3575.26] I want to establish that like the main show is over.
[3576.00 → 3577.20] I want to do the last.
[3577.84 → 3578.24] I want to do the last.
[3578.24 → 3578.82] Add to the bottom thing.
[3578.92 → 3580.22] Just in case it like did not.
[3582.58 → 3583.66] P.I.A.
[3585.12 → 3585.48] Jesse.
[3586.40 → 3586.76] Display.
[3587.74 → 3588.14] Display.
[3588.14 → 3588.42] Okay.
[3588.54 → 3589.10] Now we're back.
[3589.34 → 3590.96] Now we are attempting to end the show.
[3591.22 → 3593.12] Which is going to be the ending of the show.
[3595.64 → 3596.34] Felt short.
[3596.50 → 3596.62] It.
[3597.02 → 3597.72] I think.
[3598.30 → 3599.64] Was maybe slightly short.
[3600.12 → 3600.26] Yeah.
[3600.48 → 3601.20] It was a little bit short.
[3601.48 → 3602.28] But James has got to go.
[3603.26 → 3604.06] He's got to go.
[3607.06 → 3607.88] No super chats.
[3608.02 → 3608.22] Yeah.
[3608.32 → 3608.86] I'm sorry.
[3609.04 → 3610.32] I can't see them.
[3612.38 → 3613.80] Next time if this happens again.
[3613.84 → 3615.30] I don't know how long Linus has gone for.
[3616.22 → 3619.32] We might have to find a way to get me logged into.
[3620.16 → 3621.54] Some of the LTT stuff.
[3622.28 → 3622.46] But.
[3623.58 → 3623.94] Yeah.
[3628.22 → 3628.78] After party.
[3628.94 → 3630.00] I'm going to be streaming tonight.
[3630.70 → 3632.62] I'm going to be streaming some Horizon Zero Dawn.
[3632.90 → 3633.66] If you want to come hang out.
[3637.62 → 3638.78] Did Linus retire again?
[3639.28 → 3639.56] No.
[3639.62 → 3640.60] He's just taking a.
[3641.30 → 3642.70] Probably well needed vacation.
[3642.70 → 3662.58] I can post the.
[3662.58 → 3662.66] I can post the.
[3662.66 → 3662.68] I can post the.
[3662.68 → 3664.06] Diazo of a.
[3664.06 → 3665.24] $100 super chat.
[3665.32 → 3665.68] If you want.
[3666.76 → 3667.50] Let's not.
[3667.58 → 3668.06] Use.
[3668.54 → 3669.12] Ambiguous.
[3669.22 → 3669.66] URLs.
[3669.80 → 3670.86] Pasted into Twitch chat.
[3670.86 → 3692.94] While James tries to do that.
[3693.48 → 3695.22] Maybe I'll do another topic.
[3695.22 → 3697.52] AS Rock.
[3697.84 → 3698.24] Blacklist.
[3698.38 → 3699.04] Gamers Nexus.
[3699.04 → 3701.04] And hardware unboxed.
[3701.04 → 3702.44] AS Rock is blacklisted.
[3702.84 → 3704.44] Due to the controversy surrounding.
[3704.70 → 3706.04] Z490 content.
[3706.14 → 3707.12] Produced by Gamers Nexus.
[3707.34 → 3708.38] And hardware unboxed.
[3709.18 → 3710.34] There's a Gamers Nexus.
[3710.80 → 3712.00] Post that I believe.
[3712.34 → 3713.82] Was under a hardware unboxed.
[3713.82 → 3714.22] Video.
[3714.84 → 3715.60] Where they.
[3715.92 → 3717.16] Where I believe they talk about it.
[3717.24 → 3717.90] Gamers Nexus said.
[3718.16 → 3718.64] Fortunately.
[3718.86 → 3719.54] Most of the companies.
[3719.54 → 3720.62] Realized it's a bad idea.
[3720.62 → 3721.30] To sue media.
[3721.30 → 3722.02] Over objective.
[3723.24 → 3723.76] Sorry.
[3724.12 → 3724.98] Objectively backed.
[3725.20 → 3725.60] Statements.
[3725.94 → 3726.32] AS Rock.
[3726.40 → 3727.42] Blacklisted us.
[3727.48 → 3727.90] As well.
[3728.00 → 3728.48] It seems.
[3728.66 → 3729.36] Also because of our.
[3729.42 → 3730.30] Z490 content.
[3730.56 → 3731.18] Same boat.
[3731.56 → 3732.38] We even told them.
[3732.50 → 3733.76] We had good things to say.
[3733.82 → 3735.30] About B550.
[3735.48 → 3736.66] But they stonewalled us.
[3736.98 → 3737.50] Some companies.
[3737.50 → 3738.58] Are too stuck in the past.
[3738.62 → 3739.02] To realize.
[3739.34 → 3740.18] It's best for everyone.
[3740.22 → 3740.80] To work together.
[3741.20 → 3741.94] They'll forget about.
[3742.12 → 3743.12] Years of good things.
[3743.28 → 3744.20] That have been said.
[3744.68 → 3746.18] After one critical review drops.
[3746.40 → 3747.36] It's absolutely insane.
[3747.68 → 3747.98] I.
[3747.98 → 3749.24] Strongly agree.
[3749.50 → 3750.24] There have been.
[3750.54 → 3751.28] There's a note here.
[3751.36 → 3751.62] That says.
[3751.68 → 3752.84] LTT is pretty critical.
[3752.92 → 3753.50] Of manufacturers.
[3753.64 → 3754.62] When appropriate thoughts.
[3755.04 → 3755.36] Yeah.
[3756.82 → 3757.66] Even myself.
[3757.88 → 3758.32] Specifically.
[3758.32 → 3759.02] I have been.
[3759.36 → 3759.76] Very critical.
[3759.76 → 3760.76] About certain things.
[3760.90 → 3761.58] There was a.
[3761.82 → 3763.22] A Logitech video.
[3763.38 → 3763.66] That I went.
[3764.56 → 3764.92] Pretty.
[3766.20 → 3767.18] All in the paint.
[3767.30 → 3767.56] On.
[3768.18 → 3769.54] There was a.
[3770.98 → 3772.02] I think it was.
[3772.20 → 3772.56] Gigabyte.
[3776.54 → 3777.38] I think it was.
[3777.46 → 3777.76] Gigabyte.
[3777.98 → 3778.44] There was a video.
[3778.44 → 3778.78] That I went.
[3778.78 → 3779.40] Pretty hard on.
[3780.86 → 3781.94] And the Logitech guys.
[3781.98 → 3782.90] Are still super chill.
[3784.20 → 3784.90] Gigabyte guys.
[3785.86 → 3786.66] Weren't necessarily.
[3786.82 → 3787.10] Immediately.
[3787.50 → 3788.56] But became super chill.
[3788.82 → 3789.60] You got to understand.
[3789.74 → 3789.94] That like.
[3790.04 → 3790.36] It's not.
[3790.64 → 3791.16] I don't like.
[3791.42 → 3792.34] Hate your company.
[3792.72 → 3793.28] Hardware Unbox.
[3793.32 → 3794.14] Doesn't hate your company.
[3794.24 → 3794.60] Gamers Nexus.
[3794.68 → 3795.52] Doesn't hate your company.
[3795.52 → 3796.16] Because you release.
[3796.44 → 3796.96] Like one.
[3797.06 → 3797.92] Potentially bad product.
[3798.32 → 3798.98] You have to be able.
[3799.00 → 3799.76] To take that criticism.
[3799.90 → 3800.76] And roll forward with it.
[3801.14 → 3801.32] Hello.
[3801.54 → 3801.90] Hello.
[3802.50 → 3803.32] Are you still streaming?
[3804.66 → 3805.06] Maybe.
[3805.06 → 3807.14] Jake says.
[3807.48 → 3808.84] Just end the OBS stream.
[3809.64 → 3810.00] Okay.
[3810.24 → 3810.56] Cool.
[3810.70 → 3811.64] I just did another topic.
[3811.78 → 3812.28] While you were gone.
[3813.12 → 3813.86] YouTube is dead.
[3813.98 → 3814.26] Okay.
[3814.38 → 3814.72] Sweet.
[3814.86 → 3815.12] All right.
[3815.30 → 3816.44] That's it for the show guys.
[3817.08 → 3817.44] Goodbye.
[3818.78 → 3819.04] Well.
[3819.10 → 3820.04] I turned it to private.
[3820.32 → 3821.42] I'll turn it back to public.
[3821.56 → 3821.66] No.
[3821.78 → 3821.82] No.
[3821.82 → 3821.92] No.
[3821.92 → 3822.26] That's fine.
[3822.36 → 3822.52] No.
[3823.52 → 3824.66] Because we're ending the stream now.
[3824.70 → 3825.04] That's good.
[3826.32 → 3826.80] It's good.
[3826.94 → 3827.04] Yeah.
[3827.08 → 3828.14] But I should put it back.
[3828.36 → 3828.50] Wait.
[3828.58 → 3829.66] I don't know what happens with YouTube.
[3830.00 → 3831.56] Or with the WAN GOD.
[3831.68 → 3832.96] I think it has to become a GOD.
[3833.00 → 3833.82] And then you set it to public.
[3834.72 → 3835.78] It won't become a GOD.
[3835.84 → 3836.90] Because I haven't stopped streaming yet.
[3837.38 → 3837.58] All right.
[3837.58 → 3837.74] Well.
[3837.76 → 3838.86] I will put it to public now.
[3838.92 → 3839.80] And just let it do something.
[3839.98 → 3840.20] Okay.
[3840.30 → 3840.74] Sounds good.
[3841.00 → 3841.20] All right.
[3841.24 → 3841.78] Have a good weekend.
[3842.02 → 3842.34] Bye.
[3842.50 → 3843.16] Have a good weekend.
[3844.16 → 3844.44] Bye.
[3844.44 → 3844.50] Bye.
