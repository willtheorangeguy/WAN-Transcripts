[0.00 → 0.56] stupid
[0.56 → 9.92] and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[9.92 → 19.00] lots of big tech news NVIDIA reportedly sold 175 million dollars worth of RTX 30 series GPUs
[19.00 → 29.00] to crypto miners okay directly yeah not even crypto adults like crypto miners and not like
[29.00 → 34.24] oh they happen to like to scrape them from stores fast enough like no this was direct sales
[34.24 → 42.20] oops NVIDIA oh NVIDIA intel sorry I got the I got the the the scary you know basically wrong bad guy
[42.20 → 49.76] yeah monopoly companies uh confused intel has apparently been flooding on dozen 4000 performance
[49.76 → 56.20] on battery yeah we'll talk a little bit more about what we mean by that in a few minutes here
[56.20 → 63.12] what else we got today Luke one reseller group has snagged roughly 3500 PlayStation 5 consoles i
[63.12 → 70.32] believe they've like ouch sold them all or a lot of them or something as well pretty crazy wow um
[70.32 → 77.96] also Amazon Alexa, or it's Amazon turning Alexa devices into opt out also known as opt-in by default
[77.96 → 85.72] uh public Wi-Fi mesh networks heck yeah like super everyone wanted that everyone thought that was
[85.72 → 90.66] really cool that's what i that's what I signed up for when I got a ring doorbell I was just going to say
[90.66 → 95.46] you're everyone at the ring doorbell is definitely going to know to turn that off I was this close I was
[95.46 → 101.34] this close to installing a ring doorbell a while back ubiquity saved me they saved my butt just like
[101.34 → 108.84] I'm going to save us from talking right now well I roll the intro boom intro yep so Han shot first
[108.84 → 117.60] if Luke Skywalker says so then it's official yep I mean we can agree on that right I think so yeah I think
[117.60 → 119.58] as soon as Luke Skywalker says if it's canon
[119.58 → 128.50] I mean it was so obvious like why would you go back and go all revisionist history like that about it
[128.50 → 134.50] I mean obviously that's far from the only stupid thing they've gone back and changed but like
[134.50 → 143.12] it is clear that Han Solo is a total you know cowboy badass and someone comes looking for him
[143.12 → 149.22] he's not gonna wait for the guy to pull the trigger like why would he unclip his gun you know ahead of
[149.22 → 155.74] time so that he can wait and then blow him away through the tip like i obviously we weren't gonna
[155.74 → 162.06] believe this lie you know it's insulting that's what it is it's insulting when you tell a lie that is so
[162.06 → 169.20] obviously false that it's like what do you think I'm an idiot like because that's
[169.20 → 174.86] the only possible conclusion that I can draw from this like is there anyone who actually thinks
[174.86 → 181.44] grid shot first I want to hear from you guys flow plane chat nah you guys are too smart for that
[181.44 → 187.14] YouTube chat uh you guys are probably mostly too smart okay twitch chat here it comes
[187.14 → 194.16] always going after twitch chat with their bits with their bits
[194.16 → 201.86] all right bring your XML says grid shot first yeah well they're just they're just they're just
[201.86 → 205.92] trolling me at this point all right let's jump right into our first topic here oh man we've got
[205.92 → 210.62] another headline topic today too I hope we get through all this stuff windows has already been run
[210.62 → 220.74] on Apple Silicon what oh my goodness all right this was reported by, or it was posted by tom
[220.74 → 227.74] picks on the forum and was reported by bitcoin.com and tweak town NVIDIA's financial reports seem to
[227.74 → 236.52] suggest that they sold a huge chunk of their ampere GPUs to miners possibly explaining part of the
[236.52 → 242.58] shortage I don't think this accounts for the entire thing, but it is possibly part of the shortage
[242.58 → 251.74] it's its about a quarter million 30 80s like 250 000 is 30 80s that's a lot of 30 80s
[251.74 → 257.78] if is that was all 30 80s to be clear I don't I don't think we know like exactly what it is but if
[257.78 → 264.46] you if you break down 175 million that works uh it's very likely a mix of 30 80s and 30 70s so we
[264.46 → 269.24] don't necessarily know exactly what that looks like that's even more GPUs so like yeah not better
[269.24 → 274.08] that's a lot of cards this is the most generous possible take is that it's 250 038
[274.08 → 282.48] it's about 175 million dollars worth of inventory here and supposedly this new generation GPUs
[282.48 → 290.40] are helping out performance for Ethereum miners according to a note from RBC capital markets analyst
[290.40 → 295.90] Mitch Steve the analyst had guided sales to miners to come in at 150 million for the quarter
[295.90 → 301.02] so they they they overshot their target they overshot their target I mean to be clear I don't
[301.02 → 307.76] think NVIDIA or AMD for that matter ever stopped selling GPUs to miners just nobody cared for a long
[307.76 → 311.82] time because there was plenty enough for retail customers as well
[311.82 → 321.50] the only info we have on the total supply of 30 series GPUs is from this quote from NVIDIA
[321.50 → 328.92] we have great supply just not for this level of demand it is typical for initial demand to exceed
[328.92 → 334.72] supply for our new GPUs our global network of partners is ramping as hard as they can to get
[334.72 → 340.84] the new GPUs to the more than 100 million GeForce gamers around the world nice little plug there um
[340.84 → 348.22] okay yeah so that's that's yeah I know right by the way did we mention we have 100 million
[348.22 → 357.32] customers um there's a note in here from uh Alex who says dear Linus any insight on if this is a
[357.32 → 361.26] consequential number of GPUs yeah I think it's pretty fair to say this is a consequential number
[361.26 → 367.66] of GPUs I mean if the let's say let's say I live in an Afrocentric America centric world where i
[367.66 → 372.86] pretend the rest of the globe doesn't exist at all because America sure that happens a lot um okay so
[372.86 → 382.20] let's say I live there um that is like 0.1 percent of Americans literally the entire 0.1 percent could
[382.20 → 387.86] have run out and bought one of these GPUs okay so let's let's expand that a little bit right okay so
[387.86 → 395.92] let's include Australia uh the UK and Canada right uh whatever that was terrible Canadian accent that was
[395.92 → 401.44] terrible yeah i wonder how many cards were ceded to like Australia at all so by then we've
[401.44 → 408.20] got what I think the UK is like 50 60 million 60 70 something like that but whatever between those
[408.20 → 414.72] three countries we've got about another 100 150 million people uh so that's still like you know
[414.72 → 419.56] 0.7 percent of people in this and this is just these GPUs never mind the ones they actually did ship
[419.56 → 426.62] to gamers um and so you know let's expand it again necessarily because this was sold directly
[426.62 → 431.74] to crypto miners and what that would mean probably I'm assuming is like pallets of graphics cards to
[431.74 → 437.88] one purchaser that doesn't mean that zero people intending to use them for mining bought them from
[437.88 → 444.44] stores as well so a lot of smaller operation individuals or small groups of people that don't
[444.44 → 449.66] have the buying power to buy like a pallet of graphics cards right would have been buying them
[449.66 → 456.38] from stores there's also scalpers we saw a lot of that like the this strongly decreases the
[456.38 → 460.62] chance of gamers getting it because it's not only gamers that are buying from stores but I'm talking
[460.62 → 467.46] just about what NVIDIA is selling directly here I'm saying if NVIDIA sold these directly 0.7 of the
[467.46 → 475.50] entire population 0.7 of the entire population of like Australia UK Canada and the United States
[475.50 → 482.88] which is I'm to go based on our YouTube viewership numbers is like 70 of the English-speaking enthusiasts
[482.88 → 489.78] something along those lines uh would have been able to buy a RTX 3080 now when you consider that
[489.78 → 497.40] even among computer enthusiasts a RTX 3080 is like uh that's a like a one percent product right um I think
[497.40 → 503.66] it's pretty fair to say that if NVIDIA had shipped these two gamers instead of two directly to
[503.66 → 511.28] crypto miners pretty much anyone in those territories who wanted one could have had one by now I could be
[511.28 → 519.68] wrong I could have the numbers a little off maybe NVIDIA shipped oh I don't know uh 10 times this much
[519.68 → 527.10] to the actual computer channel like the resale channel but I doubt it because i it's not in these
[527.10 → 531.14] notes here, but it wasn't tech linked I think this works out to something like six percent of their
[531.14 → 536.28] GeForce revenue for the quarter and when you consider that they're still shipping a lot of Turing
[536.28 → 543.62] um and this is it's not too okay don't quote me on this I could be wrong on this I don't think it's
[543.62 → 548.54] six percent of ampere I think it's six percent of the GPUs they've shipped like the total revenue
[548.54 → 553.94] so given they're still shipping a ton of Turing I would think this is a lot
[553.94 → 561.60] of what NVIDIA actually shipped for ampere in that quarter um the weird thing about this to me
[561.60 → 563.60] is why
[563.60 → 566.96] like why
[566.96 → 573.98] Luke why would they do this yeah I don't know i especially because you know they're going to
[573.98 → 578.88] immediately like you've talked about this on one show before um making one of these GPUs is basically
[578.88 → 582.02] like printing money like there's no question about whether it's going to sell
[582.02 → 586.60] yeah if there's a question about whether it was going to sell, and you could sell a pallet for
[586.60 → 592.08] sure I could kind of understand that yes when you know it's going to fly off shelves I don't know
[592.08 → 599.18] maybe you're trying to own the mind share of miners so when you release a new card they're more on your
[599.18 → 603.18] side but I don't think that's really going to be a thing yeah I don't think that matters because i
[603.18 → 607.60] don't think miners make decisions based on that I'm pretty sure it comes down to power consumption
[607.60 → 613.20] hash rate like it's very transactional these are very mathematical commodity products for the mining
[613.20 → 619.50] community i i i yeah I don't buy that I don't buy that, and they would have had to know that there was
[619.50 → 624.88] going to be backlash from the gaming community who they rely on for you know oh I don't know let's say
[624.88 → 634.22] the other 94 percent of their g-force revenue um so I guess this is just NVIDIA being NVIDIA and kind of
[634.22 → 639.52] going okay well yeah it's arrogant behaviour but what they are you going to do about it right
[639.52 → 645.66] we're in video what are you going to do take your business elsewhere like get bent pretty much I mean
[645.66 → 650.10] people would probably like to, but they can't because there are no cards on the other side either I wonder
[650.10 → 656.88] if partially for the same reason yeah it wouldn't surprise me wouldn't surprise me at all that happened
[656.88 → 665.20] last time didn't it um am i totally wrong here I could be yeah no Rx uh Rx 570 was like the big
[665.20 → 671.22] the big cheese and AMD sold tons of GPUs directly to crypto miners at the height of the mining
[671.22 → 682.48] craze and what was it 2018 I think yeah I'm I'm pretty sure that's yep um Jonathan SFX china
[682.48 → 687.78] allegedly sells almost all available uh Radeon RX stock to mining farms
[687.78 → 694.94] I mean just random article I brought up if you were SFX how else would you have survived for the
[694.94 → 704.72] last 10 years like honestly when they went AMD only I was like wow could you guys have picked
[704.72 → 714.54] any worse timing for this like they went right into a decade of AMD getting absolutely stomped
[714.54 → 722.78] by and it being pretty much impossible for them to sell cards to actual gamers pretty sweet payday
[722.78 → 727.48] once mining came around though yeah I guess Jonathan Paz says could they have sold them for a premium
[727.48 → 734.66] knowing what the usage was going to be I mean yeah I guess that's possible um yeah you know what i
[734.66 → 739.64] guess that is possible because if I'm a mining outfit and I like need supply of GPUs right now
[739.64 → 749.26] so that I can mine Ethereum 2 or whatever than yeah I guess this is a like contract side deal so
[749.26 → 755.72] they don't have to like to sell it their rate that they sell to whoever yeah that's fair and they
[755.72 → 761.96] also don't have to cut anyone else in on the margin so no board partner margin they're basically just
[761.96 → 765.70] using one of their board partners probably because like who else is going to be able to make a graphics
[765.70 → 770.86] card so they'll use one of their board partners probably as just a contract manufacturer so that
[770.86 → 776.30] would be at a lower rate, and then they don't have to you know have any margin built in for a retailer
[776.30 → 780.26] or wherever else so yeah you know what maybe that's it maybe they're just making another buck
[780.26 → 785.24] because they know that you have absolutely no other choice whatsoever if you want to buy
[785.24 → 791.80] the fastest gaming graphics card yeah oh well
[791.80 → 797.48] AMD what what what do you get what are you guys talking about
[797.48 → 806.64] uh mark gallant says BS 2010 2011 2012 AMD dominated typical shill Linus uh you tell you what why don't
[806.64 → 811.78] you go back and look at what the market share numbers were like I eat cool I eat uh all right
[811.78 → 820.28] so let's go ahead and jump into our next topic here intel has been running around funding on dozen
[820.28 → 825.94] 4000 performance on battery so uh Luke do you want to run us through this one people get mad if I talk
[825.94 → 832.50] too much oh boy uh last week intel gave a presentation alleging a serious discrepancy between AMD CPU's
[832.50 → 838.36] performance on battery versus the performance of the same systems off battery according to intel
[838.36 → 844.76] while AMD's latest CPU intel's getting so scrappy I know right it's kind of cool, but they got I watched
[844.76 → 850.60] your I watched a video recently where you were like this is what competition brings and I was like yes
[850.60 → 858.52] was that the cry cooler one yes yeah yeah um uh according to intel while AMD's latest CPUs
[858.52 → 864.28] offer slightly better battery life than their intel counterparts they achieve this by reducing CPU
[864.28 → 870.90] performance when running on battery by 38 to 48 which is actually quite substantial intel 11th gen
[870.90 → 876.58] CPUs apparently lose an average of just eight percent intel slideshow backing up these claims referred
[876.58 → 882.92] to benchmarks uh the company had run on a range of mobile dozen 3 5 and 7 systems from Lenovo
[882.92 → 889.84] uh with a single system sourced from hp they drew from a wider range of systems for their intel tests
[889.84 → 896.14] referred to benchmarks like uh web PRT seamark and pc mark web expert
[896.14 → 902.92] oh that makes sense yeah that's fine the central thesis of intel's present sorry you did pretty good
[902.92 → 908.06] up till that point yeah I've even run that before that was sad the central thesis of intel's presentation
[908.06 → 913.60] is that laptop reviews should not benchmark systems only connected to ac power which
[913.60 → 921.96] that's way back we we we did that we did plug in and non-plugged in well actually what we did way
[921.96 → 925.76] back was we didn't realize the performance differences were so stark, and we didn't pay
[925.76 → 932.18] much attention to it, I think is what we really did that was like way way way back so maybe
[932.18 → 938.96] you're thinking of less way back maybe yeah because I'm I'm trying to think back to like
[938.96 → 945.66] unboxing in the house days and actually I don't even think we really like had like benchmark graphs
[945.66 → 951.30] or anything like by the time we were making charts we would have been benchmarking properly yeah but um
[951.30 → 958.04] I was talking in the office yeah oh okay never mind then um, and it is a good point uh but
[958.04 → 964.68] where it kind of starts to fall apart is intel's explanation so they say the AMD systems wait for
[964.68 → 972.86] seven to ten seconds before engaging turbo mode while intel systems engage turbo more quickly according
[972.86 → 978.40] to intel this is fair most consumer workloads are very short and this places AMD at a performance
[978.40 → 984.08] disadvantage relative to its own processors if they're not quickly engaging turbo but Luke hit me
[984.08 → 989.50] with the plot holes I want to see the plot holes the settings that control the amount of time before
[989.50 → 996.54] turbo mode engages um or turbo modes engage and the overall performance delta between ac and DC power
[996.54 → 1006.00] are settings that the OEM controls what the OEM you say oof oof intel did not acknowledge this
[1006.00 → 1013.32] as something defined by Lenovo versus AMD why did they use only Lenovo computers for AMD then Luke
[1013.32 → 1019.64] and they used a wider amount for intel no there's always you stop talking sir I want an
[1019.64 → 1027.98] explanation why did intel only use Lenovo and one hp machine to prove their point probably because they
[1027.98 → 1032.32] found some consistent data points that were really nice for them on those machines' no
[1032.32 → 1038.50] no I wait no that oh that was surprising that was a surprisingly forthright answer ah yes I accept it
[1038.50 → 1047.06] intel also did not explain why it chose to highlight the performance of the 4900 HS on the left hand
[1047.06 → 1056.06] side of the graph above are you showing that no we have a graph i will try to obtain a graph for
[1056.06 → 1065.34] you sir that's an amazing bullet point um um uh CPU was not part of the set of five systems
[1065.34 → 1072.44] that were used to average uh to average performance that's hilarious actually intel did not provide
[1072.44 → 1078.16] data for each individual system showing that each system boosted in the same delayed fashion and even
[1078.16 → 1085.52] if it had four of the laptops from made by the same vendor Lenovo okay so I'm looking for a graph here
[1085.52 → 1098.22] I haven't found a graph here um, um well whatever the point is the point is intel can you just not like
[1098.22 → 1104.76] you have to you have to know the thing is that the thing is they do know I know they know, but you got
[1104.76 → 1112.66] to remember intel's a gigantic company right, so there's smart diligent people at intel people with
[1112.66 → 1118.98] integrity at intel who know that they're going to get called on this and not even that who know that
[1118.98 → 1123.74] they just should market the products honestly and with transparency there's people who know that
[1123.74 → 1131.18] and then there's the people who are smart but don't have integrity that are going to know that they
[1131.18 → 1135.66] should just market the products honestly because they're going to get caught right so it comes down
[1135.66 → 1140.82] to the whole like Dungeons and Dragons thing right like there 's's your there's your lawful evil
[1140.82 → 1147.78] and your neutral evil and your chaotic evil right so your lawful evil is you know the
[1147.78 → 1153.40] marketing executive and I don't mean like evil I mean like there's people who are like yeah
[1153.40 → 1158.10] marketing is evil you know everything should just be a spec sheet so you know evil in that sense you
[1158.10 → 1163.46] know marketing okay so that's your lawful evil, but you know it should be like honest marketing you know
[1163.46 → 1168.50] and then you got your neutral evil it's like you know yeah whatever yeah yeah kind of whatever we'll
[1168.50 → 1172.94] let it let it go, and then you got your chaotic evil that's just like yeah you know whatever
[1172.94 → 1176.06] we're just going to say whatever we want, and they're going to be too stupid to figure it out
[1176.06 → 1183.26] and the problem that intel runs into is for whatever reason the people who have the sense
[1183.26 → 1192.38] to just market the product in a way that is meaningful and honest seem to get drowned out by
[1192.38 → 1199.44] either dummies or dishonest people who think they're not going to get caught and or even if they do get
[1199.44 → 1206.34] caught it's not going to matter and I don't know what else to say about it at this point other than
[1206.34 → 1213.02] please stop I was just going to say I feel like they get caught every time but now I wonder like
[1213.02 → 1220.02] what stuff is getting through the filter well it's not just do they get caught right because they get
[1220.02 → 1225.64] caught by the enthusiast community but let's face it the audience watching this show right now it's about
[1225.64 → 1232.16] 15 000 people are watching this show right now what percentage of laptop buyers is that like it's like
[1232.16 → 1238.28] nothing so unless all of you go talk to a hundred of your friends and who am I kidding you don't have
[1238.28 → 1244.54] a hundred friends we're not even we're not even having a Facebook says you do yeah even if you're
[1244.54 → 1250.40] Facebook how many friends does Facebook think I have wow I have not clicked on that link for
[1250.40 → 1255.44] a long time I am not even signed in okay then never mind I don't know how many friends I have on Facebook
[1255.44 → 1261.88] oh wait oh, oh it autopopulated I'm signed in to my uh my thing oh no there's a code generator
[1261.88 → 1267.66] i you know what no I want to know I want to know how many friends on Facebook it should honestly i
[1267.66 → 1273.36] think it's I don't know it's been a long time I think it's a yes button on your phone this was me
[1273.36 → 1279.44] uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah gotta we got a whole last time I had to do that it is asked for
[1279.44 → 1284.64] a code, but it never sent a code it was either a yes button that was a pop-up or you had to go into
[1284.64 → 1289.80] the app and like find the thing and say like yeah it's fine that's totally weird it did ask me for a
[1289.80 → 1294.54] code, but then it just like had me answer a bunch of questions on my phone and then I had no code in
[1294.54 → 1299.92] there and I just pressed continue it's like yeah okay how do you tell how many friends you have
[1299.92 → 1307.94] here hold on a second uh oh wait no this is Linus this I'm managing a page I'm on page Linus
[1307.94 → 1318.58] tech hey I got 188 friends nice dude super popular got 188 that's like 88 more friends than i just
[1318.58 → 1324.96] told you guys you don't even have got them, and you know what I'm going to share I'm gonna share this I'm
[1324.96 → 1330.72] gonna share this news on my Facebook right now uh it'll be the first post I've made on Facebook since
[1330.72 → 1336.72] how do you see how do you see posts you've made on Facebook I don't know I don't use Facebook

[1352.48 → 1359.86] is it still called a wall can i post I'm the wrong person to ask I have no idea I think you can't
[1359.86 → 1363.60] you know but I don't think you I don't think you do it by going to your profile anymore I think you
[1363.60 → 1370.08] just do it on the main page what's going on right now is hilarious because you know five years ago
[1370.08 → 1374.94] we would have sounded like boomers and now the fact that we don't know how to use Facebook is the
[1374.94 → 1382.42] the least boomer thing ever uh yeah I'm all the way back to 2016 and I haven't posted a single thing to my
[1382.42 → 1387.60] Facebook all right so I'm doing it today what was the thing I said that everyone had to share with
[1387.60 → 1398.50] a hundred friends uh intel needs to just market their products uh with facts rather than um
[1398.50 → 1407.44] rather than bending the truth how about that yeah all right I'm going for it and I'm going to put I'm
[1407.44 → 1413.20] going to put a GIF in their oh wow I found a great one I'm going with this chicken what do you think

[1465.46 → 1474.96] okay um so I guess that's pretty, pretty much all I have to say about that it's its lame and they

[1573.94 → 1576.10] vessi.com slash wan show
[1576.10 → 1587.40] all right cool oh do we want to get into the reseller group that snagged 3,500 PlayStation 5 consoles
[1587.40 → 1594.62] sure yeah this is kind of ridiculous and this immediately came to mind when we were
[1594.62 → 1599.42] talking about the graphics cards that NVIDIA sold directly to miners yeah like this type of stuff
[1599.42 → 1605.32] is happening everywhere right now and this like whole reseller group we're gonna start talking about
[1605.32 → 1613.64] um I think yeah crep chief notify yeah is that actually what it's called more like um crap face
[1613.64 → 1622.88] notify yeah got him notify you of a of a poppy face um like there 's's I think there's
[1622.88 → 1628.26] more services than just this one there was another one that I think had a different name uh that
[1628.26 → 1636.34] blew up over um a different product that they helped people buy a ton of early um there's like
[1636.34 → 1643.08] software that people pay very small amounts for that will scalp these things for them now like they don't
[1643.08 → 1650.22] even have to be fast they don't have to be innovative nope you just pay a very small amount of money
[1650.22 → 1655.20] to make a large amount of money by being a scumbag it's the scalper equivalent of being a script kitty
[1655.20 → 1663.32] yeah, but it's like even worse because you don't even have to like to try to run the code
[1663.32 → 1671.08] it just happens um it's like me when I was like 12 and downloaded a Diablo one trainer
[1671.08 → 1680.30] trying to convince people my godly plate of the whale was real yeah perfect um so yeah i I don't know
[1680.30 → 1689.16] like this is so pervasive these days so there's what thousands of members in this group their
[1689.16 → 1694.82] collective number is just shy of 2500 PlayStation 5 consoles across their members in addition to
[1694.82 → 1700.60] just under a thousand pre-orders from back in September um and how were they so successful
[1700.60 → 1706.20] uh they were asked we knew where to go before they announced it said a manager at crew chief notify
[1706.20 → 1712.04] so they've got they've got 12 people on staff they charge a subscription fee for access starting at
[1712.04 → 1720.44] 30 pounds so that's about 40 us dollars and going up to 530 dollars that's like significant you got
[1720.44 → 1729.16] to scalp a lot of PlayStation to yeah what oh so it's not just PlayStation oh so you can
[1729.16 → 1733.34] see oh so they compete with other such groups to see who can snag the most that's what I'm talking
[1733.34 → 1740.58] about this is across everything like internet sales in general are just ruined right now basically
[1740.58 → 1746.34] if you're is you're like launching some product if you expect it to sell out and the community
[1746.34 → 1752.62] expects it to potentially not even if you expect it to sell out if there's a chance that scalpers
[1752.62 → 1758.56] could drive it to the point of it selling out they will do so that they can scalp you super hard
[1758.56 → 1768.34] um it's its brutal and like internet sales in general like hopefully stripe or Braintree or
[1768.34 → 1773.70] someone comes up with some form of actually perfect solution to this I have no idea what it could
[1773.70 → 1780.66] be, but hopefully they come up with something yeah i actually this is horrible I don't know what you
[1780.66 → 1788.38] can really do because honestly the only answer that I can really come up with is some like crazy big brother
[1788.38 → 1796.60] like you've got it you've got to you know scan your passport to buy a product right like to create
[1796.60 → 1802.46] ridiculous scan your passport to buy some shoes like that's this that's so exactly like some kind of
[1802.46 → 1807.98] providing some kind of horrific amount of personally identifiable information it's like look to be clear
[1807.98 → 1816.46] guys I am not voting for that like I'm just saying i i I don't see any other way to have
[1816.46 → 1823.62] to to to enforce something like you know one per customer per item right like because people can
[1823.62 → 1830.58] have tons of credit cards or other payment methods and shop at lots of different places and there's
[1830.58 → 1839.44] just there's no there's no feasible way to enforce it um I mean one thing you can do is you can limit the
[1839.44 → 1845.64] number of places that you can get access to the product so I mean but that only works in theory like
[1845.64 → 1850.08] NVIDIA tried this when they had their founders' edition cards and what they discovered was that
[1850.08 → 1855.04] because they didn't have experience preventing people from checking out with multiple items
[1855.04 → 1858.54] there was nothing they could do to stop the bots and scalpers anyway
[1858.54 → 1871.88] wow interesting um check this out I'm going to send it to you on the discords this was posted in
[1871.88 → 1883.68] float plane chat um oh boy what do you get oh there he is stock checker with audio that's Aladdin
[1883.68 → 1892.32] what is this it's a stock checker with audio alerts for as you can see coming through on the ticks
[1892.32 → 1897.38] newegg.ca Amazon best buy I don't know if there are others included
[1897.38 → 1905.06] okay hold on a second you'll have to give me uh dang it Jake not now
[1905.06 → 1913.16] okay he's messaging me about like some server optimizations that he's made uh okay yeah give
[1913.16 → 1918.66] me a sec let me pull this up so yep I guess I want to go to this site look at this look at this crazy
[1918.66 → 1928.18] ship guys, so this is it stock checker interesting this is i I feel like a lot more manual
[1928.18 → 1936.10] this is insane this is completely insane this goes on for hours
[1936.10 → 1944.02] uh i I think it just goes on forever it's a live stream error failed to parse card
[1944.02 → 1947.70] the date oh my goodness
[1947.70 → 1953.78] it's total madness I mean people have they've gone they've gone mad
[1953.78 → 1961.50] yeah purchasing highly sought after items online is just ruined right now like unless
[1961.50 → 1967.34] you basically want to be a scalper, and then it's the greatest time ever I guess
[1969.34 → 1971.82] because you can like ruin Christmas for a bunch of people
[1972.46 → 1978.54] yeah that that blows I mean because it's about more than just like money at that point
[1978.54 → 1985.18] for a lot of people these products are they have like an emotional meaning for them like and not
[1985.18 → 1989.50] just for the people receiving them like for the people giving them like you're basically ruining the
[1989.50 → 1994.70] Christmas of a whole family that wants to like to give their kids a game console or whatever
[1996.06 → 2000.62] and especially while everyone's stuck inside with covet like yeah you're you're just you're being a
[2000.62 → 2008.70] downer you're being a Debbie downer sucks bro it's not fun it's not cool that's the bottom line you're not
[2008.70 → 2016.14] cool I mean you got money which you could use to like to buy cool stuff, and then you know decorate yourself
[2016.14 → 2022.78] with it which my understanding is that some people think is like being cool, but it's not the same
[2022.78 → 2028.46] it's not the same you're not actually cool, so one reseller on Twitter said with a photo of what
[2028.46 → 2036.46] appeared to be more than a dozen PS5 consoles my bot came through he was selling the 500 PS5 for
[2036.46 → 2045.34] 1100 and the 400 model for 900 that's crazy that's like a quick five six grand
[2047.26 → 2054.14] unbelievable uh Sony is selling directly to consumers, but the resupply drops are sporadic
[2054.14 → 2059.74] GameStop said it would have consoles available in store for Black Friday but the only guaranteed
[2059.74 → 2066.46] quantity is two consoles per store deep uh Walmart is offering sales on Black Friday but only through
[2066.46 → 2071.50] the web store and black best buy has said they won't have any additional consoles for the rest
[2071.50 → 2077.10] of the holiday season now that's a little SUS that's weird why would everyone else be getting
[2077.10 → 2081.10] shipments and Best Buy is not getting shipments unless they're unloading them at a higher price on
[2081.10 → 2086.46] the side someone find a way to mine cryptocurrency on PS5 I know right oh it's a matter of time telling
[2086.46 → 2098.54] stuff it's a matter of time Luke PS5 I think is less less likely than Xbox yeah oh okay well in other
[2098.54 → 2104.70] news here's a product that you can definitely get because I was totally mistaken about how many of
[2104.70 → 2111.58] these we had in stock when I talked about it on the previous uh live stream uh we actually have like i
[2111.58 → 2118.30] I think it's 10 000 of these in stock well we got well okay we've sold through like well over a
[2118.30 → 2124.78] thousand of them so they definitely are selling, but we just also do have we do have stock so uh this is
[2124.78 → 2133.50] my this is my pimp speak my pimping out ltdstore.com this is my pitch all right it's my Ltd store my
[2133.50 → 2140.22] Ltd super door spot the ABCs of gaming suck it gaming is this uh
[2141.10 → 2145.74] maybe you don't even want to answer this is this a one-time run thing um I don't know
[2147.10 → 2152.38] your kid will quit wedding beds and start clicking heads l is for loot noob I've been thinking about
[2152.38 → 2158.38] getting like a few don't have friends and just like having them for when friends of mine inevitably have
[2158.38 → 2165.02] kids get yours now at ltdstore.com the ABCs of gaming can you spell pwned batteries not included
[2165.02 → 2171.90] all right so that's uh that's it that's the little the fun little commercial that we made for it
[2171.90 → 2174.54] like the video I was like what is he doing
[2177.18 → 2183.66] yeah i played the video um so it's something we plan to run for the foreseeable future
[2183.66 → 2188.78] and between all the samples we got from the manufacturer we ended up using and all the samples
[2188.78 → 2193.74] that we got from all the manufacturers we didn't end up using uh I'm sure I've got you covered Luke
[2193.74 → 2199.42] if you ever need a desperation gift you know I always got your back for that dude multiple times
[2199.42 → 2204.78] so many times multiple times I have bailed you out Luke has even I don't think your mom watches
[2204.78 → 2209.98] when show anymore, so this should be fine Luke has even bought gifts for his mom on the day of her
[2209.98 → 2215.50] birthday at work on the way over there it's been like i I need something for my mom what's like cool
[2215.50 → 2220.38] mom tech and I'm like what when's your mom's birthday today now I'm going my way to dinner
[2221.66 → 2228.30] the only two birthdays I actually want to know with 100 certainty is mine and my dad's
[2229.02 → 2235.98] and the only reason I know my dad's is that it's its on an extremely significant event right
[2236.78 → 2244.78] that makes sense i I am pretty sure between two days and I'm pretty sure I know the month
[2245.66 → 2249.34] for my girlfriend that I've been dating for extremely close to six years
[2251.02 → 2256.62] and I know no one else's at all I don't even know like the time of year for most of my friends
[2257.50 → 2261.90] I message you on yours, but that's only because I have a calendar thing actually I lied that's only
[2261.90 → 2269.42] because Ivan has one, and she tells me oh nice yeah so I'm not even I'm not even going to pretend I'm not
[2269.42 → 2276.86] even going to pretend man no I have no memory for that at all all all right so why don't we jump into
[2276.86 → 2286.70] our next topic here uh windows is running on Apple Silicon Alexander graph is the dev that got
[2286.70 → 2294.14] it running let's fire up Mr graph's twitter here check this out who said windows wouldn't run well on
[2294.14 → 2299.90] Apple Silicon I actually don't think anyone said that I think what people said is that it wouldn't
[2299.90 → 2306.94] run because Microsoft won't allow it to uh because licensing blah blah etc, but he goes and says it's
[2306.94 → 2318.30] pretty snappy here now Mr graph is not running on bare metal so um it's like kind of hack but the
[2318.30 → 2326.54] fact that it's even running in a VM is still proof that it's architecture compatible which is pretty sick
[2326.54 → 2336.30] um uh yeah I'm I'm not very hopeful um and not because of Apple Silicon or anything like
[2336.30 → 2345.02] that watch it yeah you might get attacked again I don't think you must be stoked no I don't have to
[2345.02 → 2349.90] be stoked because I don't think that Microsoft is going to change the licensing terms for windows on arm
[2350.62 → 2356.38] they I mean it's been out for eight years or whatever uh they've had arm builds of windows for like
[2356.54 → 2364.38] since Windows 8, and they have never changed it they have never shown any interest whatsoever in
[2364.38 → 2370.62] allowing individuals at retail to buy a license for windows on arm uh whether they want to use it on a
[2370.62 → 2376.38] virtual machine or on an arm desktop or whatever the case may be so the only way to get your hands on it
[2376.38 → 2382.46] is to pirate it and i just I don't know I haven't seen any indication that that's going to change I would
[2382.46 → 2388.46] love to be wrong about this I would actually be stoked for windows on arm to not only be available
[2388.46 → 2395.02] for apple users to use if they want but for it to be available to general consumers so that hopefully
[2395.02 → 2400.62] at some point we will see some actual support for it um I mean it was just it was one of those things
[2400.62 → 2405.42] where i I think I told you this already but I went back and i re-watched my video of the original
[2405.42 → 2412.22] surface RT, and it was like looking at a completely different person because I had so much hope for
[2412.86 → 2419.34] like windows on arm I was like oh wow like this is cool there are some limitations but like yeah they'll
[2419.34 → 2425.82] get that sorted they didn't get it sorted out it was a different time then and i think one of
[2425.82 → 2433.18] the reasons like I don't know you we learn as people you have experiences your opinions and
[2433.18 → 2437.98] your approaches to things grow and I think you got burned in the past so you were just more skeptical
[2437.98 → 2445.50] this time yeah um I mean to be clear my skepticism is still working out pretty great when it comes to
[2445.50 → 2454.22] windows on arm um it still sucks so and like and like i i I get it because usually I mean Microsoft's
[2454.22 → 2461.26] not google they don't drop things like they do right um so i I think in general their support
[2461.26 → 2470.62] is usually better what did you say I actually didn't catch it sir oh yeah yeah that's true
[2470.62 → 2480.54] and zoom and a few other things yeah yeah it happens definitely happens group up I'm sorry oh wow
[2481.18 → 2488.14] who jeez sorry I had a let me just get a drink lttstore.com it's still there i you could keep
[2488.14 → 2493.82] going for a long time, and they're still going to get nowhere close to google that's true that's fair
[2493.82 → 2500.30] that's fair you know I had someone get mad at me on Twitter today because they uh they saw uh my
[2500.30 → 2507.26] review of the uh Chromecast android TV, and they were like Linus is hating on stadia is great
[2507.26 → 2514.70] game streaming is the future what I actually said was not a lot of people are using it which is a fact
[2514.70 → 2520.14] they're probably going to kill it and then that they're probably going to kill it no it was a sick burn
[2520.14 → 2527.18] on Google for destroying everything they've ever built not a burn on stadia for being bad I mean
[2527.18 → 2532.78] I haven't looked at it since quite a while ago it might be bad for all I know it's just that wasn't
[2532.78 → 2538.78] what I was talking about oh you guys are killing me here you guys are killing me here
[2538.78 → 2547.74] oh anyway apparently scalpers are buying the books already it's a bad play it's a bad play guys i just
[2547.74 → 2554.86] told you we have lots of them I just said we have 10 000 units in stock okay it's a board book for
[2554.86 → 2561.02] gamers it's not exactly like you know a PlayStation 5 I don't know guys I think these are going to fly off
[2561.02 → 2565.90] the shelves it's a holiday item you can give it at Christmas you can give it to prospective parents you
[2565.90 → 2571.90] can give it to current parents you can stock up now and have spares just in case like with in my
[2571.90 → 2576.54] situation you're you're growing up now and some of your friends are going to have kids there's probably
[2576.54 → 2582.54] going to be a baby boom from covet you might as well be prepared oh my god there probably is you are so
[2582.54 → 2588.38] right how did I not think of that yeah how would they're not happening guys you want to have
[2588.38 → 2593.34] presents lined up nine months from now because you don't like actively shopping, and you can just put it
[2593.34 → 2599.34] somewhere in a little box problem solved done get 10 of them easy no big deal someone bought seven
[2600.38 → 2605.74] solved seven is not the right number of this book maybe he has exactly seven friends
[2607.58 → 2614.22] okay that's that's possible he just knows his environment you know that's possible um intelligent
[2614.22 → 2618.86] purchase all of that stuff you said was actually stuff i totally thought about when we decided
[2618.86 → 2626.06] to do this book it was like hey when I was reading like ABCs to my kids why is it an is for apple
[2626.86 → 2634.94] a can be for lots of things like arcade or Atari we could yeah and like i when you did your i I think
[2634.94 → 2641.34] it was last one show you did a little excerpt where you read from it a little bit yep yep yep I thought it
[2641.34 → 2647.26] was pretty good oh, thank you it's kind of clever a lot of our generation plays at least some amount of
[2647.26 → 2655.74] games or did at one point um it's a fun take it's not too expensive it's pretty pricey I can explain
[2655.74 → 2664.70] that though like a costs money to self-publish it's 15 us dollars like it's not a lot I don't know
[2664.70 → 2672.94] a typical board book is anywhere from like eight to like 12 so we're definitely on the high side um but
[2672.94 → 2679.18] the cold hard truth is that we had to self-publish so we're taking on all the risk taking on all of
[2679.18 → 2684.86] the cost of working directly with a manufacturer and producing let me put it this way the 10 000
[2684.86 → 2690.54] units we have that's the initial shipment that's the air shipment there's more coming by boat like we
[2690.54 → 2697.18] have a freaking ton of these things because we self-published it um, so there's that there's also the
[2697.18 → 2705.58] fact that um our distribution is done through like my ex bros from NCI it's not we're not Amazon
[2705.58 → 2710.86] so our distribution costs are very significant and that has to be baked into the price of every product
[2710.86 → 2716.54] that's why the cable ties are they're either 10 or 15 or something like that or like 20 bucks, and it's
[2716.54 → 2723.98] because we had to order like tens and tens of thousands of them store them for literally over a year
[2723.98 → 2730.54] which cost money too because they sold really slowly, and we have to pay a bunch of distribution
[2730.54 → 2737.26] fee every time we have to ship one so it just is what it is so also the reason that we wanted
[2737.26 → 2743.98] to market at that price was that there are many booksellers that have to a requirement for you to
[2743.98 → 2748.14] sell in their store that they have to be able to advertise a lower price than what's printed on the
[2748.14 → 2755.34] back of the book so we wanted to get out ahead of that if anyone ever carries it so far they haven't
[2755.34 → 2763.58] I'm actually really surprised we talked to Best Buy um and i I don't know i I guess clearly nothing
[2763.58 → 2770.70] ever came of it but I'm looking at it going like why not like how did you not just be like
[2770.70 → 2778.70] yeah I'll bring in 10 units per store it's basically zero risk, and it's just like this is something
[2778.70 → 2785.82] that if you put it in the impulse buying idol at like kind of our age group I could definitely see
[2785.82 → 2794.70] that moving I don't know like 18-year-old me going in to buy in uh an Xbox game or whatever the heck no
[2794.70 → 2802.06] I'm not going to pick that up but like if it's in the impulse buying aisle and I'm like hey so-and-so
[2802.78 → 2807.74] is going to be having a kid soon or had a kid recently I pick one of these up just in case
[2807.74 → 2812.54] there's some gathering or something I can give it to him that'll be a cool little gift like that's
[2812.54 → 2818.46] that's absolutely something I would do yeah so Joe smith says I think Linus over ordered the way he's
[2818.46 → 2824.46] talking um it depends so we knew we were bringing these in for the holiday season, and we didn't know
[2824.46 → 2829.98] if any resellers would pick it up the way it is now we'll sell through them eventually like we
[2829.98 → 2835.50] launched this three or four days ago, and we've already sold I think about 1200 1300 units like
[2835.50 → 2842.78] they're moving it's fine I'm not actually worried about if it's just that it will take a long time
[2842.78 → 2846.70] at the rate that it's going so we're going to have to absorb some of that storage cost in order to meet
[2846.70 → 2853.58] the order quantities that we had to manufacture our own book and the other thing we didn't know
[2853.58 → 2860.22] was if this was even going to be enough if someone like a best buy had picked it up or someone like
[2860.22 → 2866.86] a chapters or indigo had picked it up and been like okay I want 100 units per store that would
[2866.86 → 2875.58] have been a hundred thousand units right so if someone picks it up then we won't have enough and
[2875.58 → 2881.02] if nobody picks it up then we've got too many, but we'll sell through them eventually it's its a really
[2881.02 → 2885.74] fun little book I'm not actually worried about being stuck with them forever we're also hopefully
[2885.74 → 2892.22] going to do a little bit of marketing around it like on um like twitch and Facebook and YouTube gaming and
[2892.22 → 2899.42] stuff like that um and that's why we produced that 30 second clip um so hopefully it's all
[2899.42 → 2903.02] hopefully it's all good you know what you know what I'm going to go get it I'm gonna I'm going to read you
[2903.02 → 2907.10] guys a couple pages people are like what is this a kid's book like yeah nice board book
[2910.86 → 2915.98] while he's gone is there anything we can go into I believe the next topic we are going to be talking
[2915.98 → 2924.86] about is Amazon turning Alexa devices into opt-out public Wi-Fi mesh networks this is actually amazing
[2926.06 → 2931.34] this topic is fantastic it's called sidewalk oh he's back already so I won't dive too far into it but I'm
[2931.34 → 2935.58] I'm pretty excited to talk about that all right I'll let you pick uh I'll let you pick six letters
[2936.78 → 2940.94] okay um l oh sorry one sec hey munch kin what's up
[2945.74 → 2948.22] a ring with a ring with a one
[2951.82 → 2952.46] maybe later
[2952.46 → 2965.10] okay do you distribute to book reviewers is that a thing
[2972.54 → 2980.46] okay, okay thanks much Karen okay I have no idea what she's talking about all right
[2980.46 → 2989.58] all right so you want l uh just um yeah l here we go oh there we go
[2990.30 → 2995.66] l is for loot didn't get the drop you need start over with a different seed
[2998.14 → 3009.58] hey I like it, I like it uh f okay f is for frame rate some say 60 is enough I know you won't believe
[3009.58 → 3025.10] that stuff oh okay uh one man no yeah there we go o is for online staying safe is not a game
[3025.10 → 3026.70] never share your home or name
[3026.70 → 3031.26] very nice life tips for gamers
[3032.94 → 3038.38] a t p a t and p okay yeah well an is for arcade
[3039.26 → 3042.62] do you want to have some fun insert two coins please player one
[3043.98 → 3051.58] t I don't even remember what t is for t is for texture without these models would be flat and no one wants to look at that
[3051.58 → 3063.10] and what was the last one p p p yeah okay p uh oh I know that one p is for party it's fun to play a damage dealer but don't forget to bring a healer
[3065.18 → 3073.82] see they're good I don't know I'm pretty proud of it i I had a lot of fun writing it and unlike okay so here's the thing
[3073.82 → 3082.54] a lot of like influencers write books but I know for a fact that a lot of those books are not actually
[3082.54 → 3088.06] written by them so for me yeah that's a huge thing I don't have time to write a book right now like not
[3088.06 → 3094.86] a real one for sure um so what this was the book that I actually have time to actually write
[3094.86 → 3105.98] oh man uh Sean is so much more interested now yeah who is supposed to buy these I don't understand
[3105.98 → 3110.78] who the market is for as the age range for this product is as the age range for this product is
[3110.78 → 3119.26] unable to video games that's like saying I don't understand who buys an abc book that's like c is for car
[3119.26 → 3126.70] because babies can't drive f is for fire truck you can't, you can't put out fires, yet it doesn't make any sense
[3126.70 → 3133.82] like what are you talking about it's just it's just like cute pictures and just talking to your children it's so important
[3133.82 → 3142.78] like it was really cool my son had reached like kind of a breakthrough moment probably an I'd say in the last six months
[3142.78 → 3149.82] where he stopped reading like to find out what was going to happen to the character like he's been
[3149.82 → 3155.18] reading fluently for quite some time he's eight um, but he stopped reading just to like to find out what's
[3155.18 → 3161.66] going to happen and like to understand the gist of it and started reading just like for pleasure and like
[3161.66 → 3168.62] would laugh to start laughing to himself while he's reading like really getting it, and it's a ton of work
[3168.62 → 3178.30] to get your kids not just knowing how to read but really valuing reading, and it is so important for
[3178.30 → 3187.50] so it's more than just the ability to absorb a story being able to read not just look at words but to read
[3187.50 → 3195.98] to understand what someone is saying is such an important life skill for cutting through BS and for
[3195.98 → 3201.98] navigating life um and so you know that's one of our big goals for our kids and one of the things
[3201.98 → 3211.18] that we've done is I'd say with about 95 success is reading to our kids every night starting from when
[3211.18 → 3217.34] they're probably about six months old and so this is the kind of book that they just grab
[3217.34 → 3222.86] whatever is like a nice colour and has pictures that they like and some of these are inter are interactive
[3222.86 → 3230.78] and they're meant to be um so for example m is for oh yeah here we go q is for quest uh put your
[3230.78 → 3236.14] finger by the tree can you find the locking key so once they get a little bit older and their motor
[3236.14 → 3240.14] skills get a bit better they're meant to kind of trace their finger through the maze and get the
[3240.14 → 3243.98] little treat so it's its meant to be a little bit interactive, and it's just supposed to be time that
[3243.98 → 3249.26] you spend together they're hearing your voice they're starting to put together this concept that oh the
[3249.26 → 3255.74] things you're saying are to do with what's on the page um these are skills that you know
[3255.74 → 3261.66] you can kind of take for granted but the earlier you can work on them the more you can build them
[3261.66 → 3269.02] and it's I don't know it's just very very very important so it doesn't matter if they actually
[3269.02 → 3274.78] understand exactly what you're saying and a lot of what we have in here is just meant to be more like
[3274.78 → 3281.66] you know inside jokes for the adults I mean what are the odds that a child is going to recognize
[3281.66 → 3288.38] that yellow exclamation mark above our n is for NPC right like it's not but if you're an old school
[3288.38 → 3298.86] wow player you're going to be like who did the illustrations uh sarah did yeah yeah she had
[3298.86 → 3305.42] some people asking in chat she did an amazing job so uh we didn't put either the author or illustrator
[3305.42 → 3310.78] on the front because we wanted this to be more like by Linus media group, but we do have credits for
[3310.78 → 3321.10] me and Sarah on the back cool um yeah i uh oh actually which one was I looking at before uh and so
[3321.10 → 3328.78] my chat said I'm just sad l is not for ltdstore.com no, no I mean we thought about having some jokey
[3328.78 → 3337.42] ones like that like f is for pay respects, or you know whatever but uh oh interesting uh
[3338.30 → 3343.74] okay I don't want to overpromise to you guys, but it's possible you won't have to pay shipping
[3343.74 → 3350.14] because we are working on figuring out a deal possibly with micro centre to carry these hey cool
[3350.14 → 3354.94] yeah that that totally makes sense I mean honestly I don't see why any computer store
[3354.94 → 3360.62] wouldn't just carry them at least some right and if you do like a tiny run you could always
[3360.62 → 3372.54] reorder more yep uh carbon says that butt can draw already than oh let's move on that took me a second
[3372.54 → 3380.14] I was like what oh yeah Amazon is turning Alexa devices into an opt-out public Wi-Fi mesh network
[3380.14 → 3385.58] yes on a scale of one to ten on a scale of one to ten how happy does this make you
[3387.50 → 3394.78] one is a little bit happy like a little tickle in the bottom of your tummy okay and ten is like
[3394.78 → 3399.02] the happiest you've ever been in your life you know you just won the lotto, and it was delivered to
[3399.02 → 3406.54] you by a naked supermodel, and you're you know you're going to get on your private jet and go to your
[3406.54 → 3415.58] private island and um you know whatever i I think I have given that intensity of scale and given the that
[3415.58 → 3423.90] the fact that a one is actually decently happy and like neutral happiness is not a five I'd maybe say
[3423.90 → 3430.94] uh like at least a six you'd say a six okay but you have to remember the bottom of this scale is happy
[3430.94 → 3436.86] yeah so you're pretty happy you're pretty darn happy this is pretty great it's amazing the
[3436.86 → 3442.78] feature is called sidewalk um it is sent to launch later this year man I'm like up in my chair and
[3442.78 → 3451.42] everything um it will connect Alexa devices to nearby Wi-Fi networks anyone's uh even those owned by
[3451.42 → 3458.46] other individuals not like uh store hotspots or anything like that um sidewalk uses Alexa
[3458.46 → 3464.86] devices including echo and ring doorbells to create shared networks uh meant to help devices
[3464.86 → 3470.30] work better I'll get into what that means in a second uh Amazon said in an email to device owners
[3470.30 → 3476.62] it allows nearby devices to use a portion of a neighbour's Wi-Fi bandwidth, so devices can have more
[3476.62 → 3484.94] range also I don't know where in the notes this is, but also it would help if uh you have a power outage
[3484.94 → 3490.46] but your neighbour doesn't for some reason because then that happens all the time here connect now
[3490.46 → 3496.22] it happens all the time does it no of course not okay yeah I was like what the heck it's always old
[3496.22 → 3502.22] neighbourhoods so like what a weird feature but maybe that's a thing somewhere I don't I've never
[3502.22 → 3510.62] experienced that before um yeah these bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth
[3510.62 → 3517.10] which is pooled together to provide these uh services to you and your neighbours oh how nice
[3517.10 → 3523.10] and when neighbours when more neighbours participate the network becomes even stronger I wish Jeff Bezos
[3523.10 → 3531.26] was my neighbour because then I'd have a way nicer house I wouldn't like talk to him or anything it just
[3531.26 → 3537.58] I'd love to live where he lives it's probably sick it would take you an extremely long time to get over
[3537.58 → 3543.98] to be able to talk to him yeah I know right go for a hike many neighbourhoods away even if he was
[3543.98 → 3549.82] technically your neighbour uh Amazon published a research paper detailing the technology behind
[3549.82 → 3555.82] sidewalk and the steps taken to keep users data private because that's clearly a massive concern
[3558.38 → 3566.22] the on by default approach is not consumer friendly um nope Thornton dash trump I'm not certain who that is
[3566.22 → 3573.58] um, but it says no, no one rides on my Wi-Fi for free yeah for sure yeah especially a giant corporation
[3573.58 → 3579.74] worth billions of dollars yeah um there 's's a website I don't know exactly what the URL is but
[3579.74 → 3587.42] it gives a graphical representation of how much uh wealth Jeff Bezos has accumulated oh I know it's just
[3587.42 → 3593.10] like you scroll like a bunch of other things endlessly, and you like can't scroll forever yeah yeah it's
[3593.10 → 3601.02] amazing yeah um, and it shows like the amount of like the amount of money a doctor will make in
[3601.02 → 3609.74] their lifetime, and it's this like tiny it's like a pixel school on it like just oh just no size at all
[3609.74 → 3616.06] compared to the absolute mass that is Jeff Bezos's personal wealth um even after losing a ton of it and
[3616.06 → 3623.58] a divorce beautiful um Amazon says before sidewalk launches we will notify existing customers with
[3623.58 → 3629.18] eligible bridge devices so they can consider the benefits of sidewalk before deciding if they want
[3629.18 → 3635.58] to change their preferences very, very specific wording there and after all existing customers are
[3635.58 → 3641.02] notified all customers setting up a sidewalk bridge for the first time will have the opportunity to
[3641.02 → 3648.78] enable sidewalk during device setup ah it's basically only in the US right now but apparently some
[3648.78 → 3653.58] people outside the US have received emails notifying them about the launch so we're not necessarily sure
[3653.58 → 3662.78] what that means, but it is only in the US for now all right so yeah I mean there's really no good um
[3662.78 → 3669.66] way to put this it is a matter of time until this gets horrifyingly exploited and the fact that it is opted
[3669.66 → 3676.14] out rather than opt in so that means it is enabled by default means that there's going to be a ton of
[3676.14 → 3684.86] non-tech savvy people who don't understand that smart doorbell means it's connected to someone else's
[3684.86 → 3690.70] servers and someone else is poking around in there um that are going to be exploited this is a
[3690.70 → 3697.18] matter of time, and it's uh that that's a shame uh and considering how this is worded we will notify
[3697.18 → 3701.98] existing customers with eligible bridge devices so they consider the benefits of sidewalk before
[3701.98 → 3707.90] deciding if they want to change their preferences there's a lot of very specific word usage in there
[3707.90 → 3713.66] if is they use that type of uh of language when notifying their customers about the benefits of
[3713.66 → 3719.50] this new beautiful feature they're just going to turn it on whatever you know turn it on they will not
[3719.50 → 3724.78] turn it off right oh yeah sure it sounds fine yeah yeah yeah whatever I don't want to bother going to
[3724.78 → 3731.18] that dashboard I don't know how to get there anyway exactly in other better news the EU votes for
[3731.18 → 3735.90] standardized repairability ratings on electronics the European Parliament has voted to develop and
[3735.90 → 3741.10] introduce mandatory labelling to provide clear immediately visible and easy to understand
[3741.10 → 3746.46] information to consumers on the estimated lifetime and repairability of a product at the time of
[3746.46 → 3752.38] purchase that is awesome especially because even though I'm not European, and therefore it doesn't
[3752.38 → 3757.66] technically affect me a lot of the time you still get the information whatever the EU does tend to
[3757.66 → 3764.86] trickle down into other uh other regions just because it's very inconvenient to produce a product one
[3764.86 → 3771.26] way for the EU like with better repairability so that you can have a better score and then another
[3771.26 → 3776.38] crappier way somewhere else like if you're going to make it properly in the first place you might as well just ship the good one everywhere
[3776.38 → 3783.82] um, so this is fantastic it's hoped that this will result in a mandatory repairability score index for
[3783.82 → 3789.26] all electronic products sold across the EU to help consumers shop with confidence and reduce planned
[3789.26 → 3794.94] obsolescence I wonder who's going to oversight that and I wonder what metrics they're going to look for
[3794.94 → 3800.94] uh I have no idea but the EU motion calls for a repair score similar to the scores that I fix it has
[3800.94 → 3807.82] been assigning to gadgets for the past 15 years I would love to see I fix it tapped to help develop
[3807.82 → 3814.06] something like this I don't know if that's how it'll go down because I fix it has their own agenda
[3814.06 → 3820.14] you know you can't necessarily just draw them into like uh, and they're American aren't they yeah a
[3820.14 → 3827.18] government body um but according to a recent survey 77 of EU citizens would rather repair their devices
[3827.18 → 3832.86] then replace them 79 think that manufacturers should be legally obliged to facilitate the repair
[3832.86 → 3839.02] of digital devices or the replacement of individual parts and the resolution was adopted with 395 in
[3839.02 → 3847.02] favour and just 94 against with 207 abstentions good news it is about time that right to repair
[3847.02 → 3851.82] started getting taken seriously by legislative bodies I'll be very interested to see what the new US
[3851.82 → 3858.86] administration does if anything one of my big worries is that they're going to feel like oh you know
[3859.58 → 3863.18] left-wingers are going to be so glad that it's not trump anymore that we can just
[3864.06 → 3868.86] kind of do whatever and no one will care, but that's not how it's going to go down
[3870.14 → 3876.22] they have to like actually do stuff that matters like protect net neutrality and like help right to repair and stuff
[3876.22 → 3881.58] actually I think it's pretty much bipartisan opposition to right to repair at this point so i
[3882.38 → 3884.54] don't really shouldn't really be hoping for anything
[3886.70 → 3896.70] um and the last big news item is apple m1 x max have leaked so one of the biggest complaints about the m1
[3896.70 → 3903.98] was of course the lack of performance compared to well what people might expect in a pro product or in
[3903.98 → 3908.94] well in a know proper desktop product like anything but a Mac mini, and it looks like the
[3908.94 → 3915.02] reason is that apple was holding out for the m1 x which is going to have 12 cores in total eight
[3915.02 → 3921.74] firestorm performance cores and then four ice storm high efficiency cores and naming you know four more
[3921.74 → 3927.18] cores instead of so 12 versus eight might not sound like that big of a deal to you but if it's true
[3927.18 → 3933.42] according to our testing that would put CPU performance roughly in line with the 2020 27-inch iMac
[3933.42 → 3939.98] which runs a 10 core i9 CPU and if I had to guess I'd say that thing is probably going to come
[3939.98 → 3946.94] in the like 40 to 45 watt total system power range that is nuts that's absolutely nuts
[3948.54 → 3958.78] who leaks apple pro has a spotty leak record at best um, but apple is specifically incentivizing purchases of
[3958.78 → 3965.98] intel based 16-inch macBook pros and 21-inch maxi macs for Black Friday by offering 150 gift cards
[3965.98 → 3970.94] strongly suggesting that these will be the next products to receive the Apple Silicon treatment
[3973.26 → 3978.54] sweet makes sense uh Anthony notes doubling the firestorm cores makes all the sense in the world
[3978.54 → 3982.54] for a higher performance m1 they don't really need to do much else than that I would say that a little
[3982.54 → 3987.26] more Io would be good so I don't know if i 100 agree with him, but it's also possible we'll see that
[3987.90 → 3993.02] um he has no reason to believe this would be inaccurate barring exact pricing and availability
[3993.02 → 3998.30] and which products they appear in Anthony note too if I had to guess it'll take some time before a 27-inch
[3998.30 → 4004.06] iMac and especially iMac Pro are available maybe end of 2021 early 2022 for the 27 inch I don't know
[4004.06 → 4009.18] Anthony I think it could be sooner than that I think apple's like they're going on this they're gunshot
[4009.18 → 4017.90] yeah full gunshot just like I'm gunshot on reading super chats all right guys what'd you what'd you send
[4018.86 → 4023.74] to people who don't need your money thanks Robert mail happy American thanksgiving he says
[4024.38 → 4030.62] uh lucky falcon says in a recent TV review video oh TV review video you said to get good blacks with a
[4030.62 → 4035.34] projector theatre room you would need to control the lighting I suggest a video with Santa black painted
[4035.34 → 4039.90] walls to control the light that would actually be sick and if I had access to a media room that we
[4039.90 → 4046.14] could like you know do stuff to um then I would definitely do it someday when I live next
[4046.14 → 4052.94] to Jeff Bezos and I have a big media room uh we will, we'll do a vanta black uh media room
[4053.50 → 4060.46] uh Kenneth says I'm currently seven years deep extremely expensive uh Santa black I thought it was
[4060.46 → 4065.42] well yeah, but that's why I'd be living next to Jeff Bezos by that point oh yeah, yeah right it's like
[4065.42 → 4070.14] the darkest paint or something like that like its super light absorb for those of you who aren't
[4070.14 → 4075.18] familiar with Santa black uh Kenneth says I'm seven beers deep and while I'm rolling on the floor at 8

[4080.86 → 4082.06] dollars to send that message
[4082.06 → 4090.78] yeah what you need to do is uh spin up a coin farming operation
[4093.18 → 4100.54] all right uh in other news uh Armando says you guys benchmarked the rogue Zephyrus g14 with a dozen
[4100.54 → 4105.34] 4000 series CPU do you notice anything odd about on battery performance we actually have not dug into
[4105.34 → 4110.94] those claims because we have been absolutely buried in October which has extended into December
[4111.58 → 4119.42] like I can't tell you guys what's coming, but it's not over I'll say that much Ossoff says wanted to

[4131.66 → 4137.18] appears to still be alive which is good uh how about a Plex centred video build comparison budget mid-range
[4137.18 → 4146.62] over the top I don't know it's so niche dude like I don't know how much we can I I don't know how much
[4146.62 → 4152.38] we can really say about it like more better Plex is like more better CPU is good you

[4157.66 → 4163.98] great Plex content just go watch them I mean we don't have to cover everything Ossoff sent another

[4172.14 → 4186.62] oh yeah baby faith in humanity lost faith in six pints increased yeah exactly clearly
[4186.62 → 4192.54] drunk texting me at this point I think so oh man uh

[4200.62 → 4206.78] available coupon to the cart and got me all the pizza deals nearly ended up with 60 pizzas how does

[4216.62 → 4223.02] Diablo 2 someones like can you message can you say something about this a mod for and by
[4223.02 → 4227.82] passionate Diablo 2 fans we aim to maintain the lord of destruction experience and provide consistent
[4227.82 → 4234.06] ladder resets while improving on the game as if development never ended interesting well
[4234.06 → 4238.94] apparently that's the thing and uh yeah I guess i I guess I shouted it out Adam Larson
[4240.94 → 4247.26] I definitely find Diablo 2 more interesting to play than Diablo 3 wait a minute
[4248.86 → 4257.50] addled spoon says there's a wan show reference on letter Kenny season 2, episode 1. you have got to be
[4257.50 → 4264.14] kidding me
[4264.14 → 4271.26] there's no way I don't see anyone that has specifically clipped that I would be I would be
[4271.26 → 4278.38] are you sure it's a wan show reference or is it just like a video podcast reference yeah it's probably
[4278.38 → 4284.70] not wan show it's probably not wan show all right uh there's a few more here
[4286.54 → 4293.82] uh a flying modem says I'm actually someone who got his GF pregnant during the pandemic lol six months
[4293.82 → 4299.90] to go, so the book is something I'm super excited about I was just going to say hey get a book flying
[4299.90 → 4303.66] modem what you should really be doing is saving your money not sending super chats because kids
[4303.66 → 4310.14] dang they expensive also by the way if that already happened you don't know there might be
[4310.14 → 4313.58] number two you should get more than one book they might destroy the first one
[4314.70 → 4318.94] not actually we went through a lot of manufacturers to find one that's like
[4319.58 → 4326.62] pretty indestructible so it should be kid proof okay cool uh sir Bavaria says playing RPGs
[4326.62 → 4332.22] they're why I learned to read Super Mario RPG is my childhood that game is so good I am totally
[4332.22 → 4337.74] going to start playing it tonight um actually you should say you should say kid resistant
[4338.86 → 4343.66] not kid proof you're right you're not wrong I'm totally going to play Super Mario RPG I'm going to
[4343.66 → 4349.10] start it tonight uh I've been are you streaming it took me uh I don't know probably maybe I'll think
[4349.10 → 4353.82] about it, I'll think about it because I was kind of going to play it on the couch um I couldn't play
[4353.82 → 4357.98] it for ages because it took me forever to figure out the latency fixing setting in retroarch that
[4357.98 → 4365.58] for whatever reason is not just enabled by default uh or retroarch or SNS SNS um, and so I wasn't
[4365.58 → 4371.58] able to time the double damage combos and so it was just like frustrating and annoying so i just
[4371.58 → 4378.70] kept not making it very far into it, I should totally play again um p dazzle says I have nothing
[4378.70 → 4385.50] to say just take my money um I mean all right I'll put it in the pile uh Jeremy says yeah go ahead
[4386.70 → 4391.74] if is I could speak to you super chatters for a second yeah are you subscribed to flow plane
[4392.62 → 4398.38] yeah really you get some actual benefits over there yeah there's like exclusive content and stuff
[4398.38 → 4403.74] yeah there's some like really cool stuff that goes on flow plane um and I think not enough people
[4403.74 → 4410.30] even know about it um but like some of the most here's some random uh internal insights some of
[4410.30 → 4420.30] the most some of the content with the most activity on float plane likes comments um etc views including
[4420.30 → 4427.50] views are like videos that don't hit YouTube um they're videos that I think would do poorly if they
[4427.50 → 4434.70] did to be fair um because they're like hardcore content um, but there's some really cool stuff there
[4434.70 → 4439.74] okay hold on a second Martin over on float plane says yeah 10 pints is a buzz, but six is like I'm
[4439.74 → 4444.30] taking it easy gotta go work early in the morning now hold on a second because my understanding of a
[4444.30 → 4454.70] pint of beer is that it's not an actual pint I thought it was like just like a colloquial way of describing
[4454.70 → 4462.38] like a mug my understanding was that you can order a pint and in some places a pint is like
[4463.10 → 4472.46] a ton of beer so maybe I'm mistaken I guess I'm I guess I'm wrong people are like no a pint is just
[4472.46 → 4482.30] a pint already then shows you what I know uh the mug holds a pint blah blah blah 473 mile okay yeah no I'm
[4482.30 → 4488.86] I'm completely wrong um nick pinged me on teams to say uh Sarah reacting to part three secret shoppers
[4488.86 → 4493.66] is a float plane exclusive he says float plane exclusive hard sell Sarah reacting to part three
[4493.66 → 4499.42] secret shopper yeah so that's on there uh that video if I remember correctly is like the third
[4499.42 → 4508.70] most viewed video like ever yeah it's pretty sad, and it's its hilarious so yeah all right and that's
[4508.70 → 4513.74] pretty much it for the wan show for today hopefully you guys uh
[4516.62 → 4521.98] oh I think I understood that now hopefully you guys enjoyed it we'll see you again next week same
[4521.98 → 4528.14] bat time same bat channel and Nick says also please let YouTube chat know that we are not
[4528.14 → 4533.42] making Ltd condoms because we don't want that responsibility I mean we could make a condom as long
[4533.42 → 4540.54] as it's like the like get you pregnant condom you know that then we wouldn't have to worry about like
[4540.54 → 4546.14] you know there being any misunderstanding like the bad condoms.com you know please tell me that exists
[4547.66 → 4549.10] you could bundle it with the book
[4549.10 → 4554.22] bad condoms.com
[4554.22 → 4556.22] bad condoms.com
[4556.22 → 4561.90] 2.99 for the first year available really nobody wanted bad condoms.com
[4563.18 → 4569.98] how is that even possible so I can think of all kinds of great business ideas that would go with
[4569.98 → 4578.38] bad condoms.com and I think we're done here to be fair no one has good condoms.com really
[4581.26 → 4586.86] except that one costs a lot more oh yeah and also part four of secret shopper is already out on
[4586.86 → 4593.58] flow plate it'll be coming to YouTube very good as well secret shopper was great yeah i really
[4593.58 → 4598.22] enjoyed if it's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun I'm sure it's a lot of work but yeah it's very
[4598.22 → 4606.54] entertaining vlog all right see you later guys bye and stream YouTube is dead
