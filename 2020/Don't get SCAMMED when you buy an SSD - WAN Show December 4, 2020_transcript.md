[0.00 --> 4.02]  Patreon creator and we're not on Patreon.
[6.52 --> 10.02]  Luke, shove just a little bit to your right, just like a smidge.
[10.46 --> 13.36]  And we're live! Welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[13.48 --> 17.32]  We've got a fantastic show for you today with a special guest.
[17.58 --> 22.80]  We do have some tech news, so our highlight topics of the day are of course going to be
[22.80 --> 28.04]  SSD bait and switching, meaning that you might not get the performance you expect
[28.04 --> 34.74]  when you buy a solid state drive and risk five CPUs looking to unofficially,
[34.94 --> 39.38]  absolutely decimate Apple's M1 SOC's efficiency numbers.
[39.88 --> 43.14]  What could this mean for the future? Luke, what else we got?
[43.80 --> 50.46]  And the RTX 3060 Ti launched and immediately, as everyone expected it would,
[50.46 --> 57.52]  and the Micron fab went down for one hour and DRAM prices reflected that immediately,
[57.52 --> 60.24]  which is kind of sad.
[60.38 --> 67.28]  And of course, by popular demand, we have the one, the only, Sarah Budd as a guest today!
[67.98 --> 68.78]  That's right!
[69.20 --> 73.08]  The illustrator of the ABCs of gaming, as she's best known.
[74.24 --> 77.80]  Oh wow, you have one with you. That is so awesome. Of course you do.
[77.90 --> 79.30]  I also have one behind me.
[79.30 --> 85.12]  Also, also, she's agent, what was it, Money Nickel or something?
[85.24 --> 86.68]  Sarah Jane Cash Nickel.
[86.78 --> 87.48]  Cash Nickel.
[87.88 --> 93.74]  So she is here for us to do a pretty sick Q&A session with you guys about what it was like
[93.74 --> 97.08]  being the secret agent for Secret Shopper.
[97.16 --> 100.94]  If there's anything you guys want to know, Sarah is here to answer your questions.
[100.94 --> 102.24]  Let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[102.24 --> 105.58]  It is going to be a fantastic show.
[121.22 --> 122.56]  They can hear you, by the way.
[124.20 --> 125.08]  Just so you know.
[125.26 --> 128.44]  I have no idea what you're laughing about, but they can definitely hear you.
[128.44 --> 134.40]  The show is brought to you today by Kite, Vessi Footwear, and Redux.
[134.60 --> 139.34]  And we will get you some more details about them a little bit later on.
[139.44 --> 145.54]  So why don't we just see if there's anything in here that's like kind of secret, like tangentially
[145.54 --> 148.26]  Secret Shopper related, maybe?
[149.60 --> 153.04]  Um, no, no, not really.
[153.34 --> 154.52]  There's basically nothing.
[154.52 --> 158.90]  Okay, so why don't we just jump right into the Secret Shopper Q&A?
[159.00 --> 163.36]  Because honestly, Sarah, I have some questions for you right out of the gate.
[163.46 --> 168.32]  I mean, how hard did you want to tear your freaking hair out being on the phone with Del?
[168.42 --> 172.32]  For you probably spent, I mean, you probably spent hours on the phone with Del.
[172.42 --> 172.92]  I did.
[173.52 --> 174.00]  Yes.
[174.42 --> 175.36]  Well, okay.
[175.64 --> 178.24]  Here, here, I have a tattoo that says patience.
[178.56 --> 179.70]  I don't know if you can see it.
[180.08 --> 181.96]  I'm like a super patient person.
[181.96 --> 185.86]  So like, those kind of calls don't bother me at all.
[186.14 --> 187.76]  Like, I was totally chill the whole time.
[187.86 --> 188.26]  Really?
[188.64 --> 189.58]  I was dancing to the hold music.
[189.82 --> 191.06]  Yeah, I had no issues.
[192.04 --> 192.32]  Okay.
[192.32 --> 193.46]  It was kind of fun, actually.
[194.54 --> 196.42]  That is not what...
[196.42 --> 201.78]  I don't think I've ever heard anyone describe being put on hold for hours as fun.
[201.90 --> 202.34]  Yeah.
[202.88 --> 203.66]  I mean...
[203.66 --> 204.62]  You know, that's cool.
[204.82 --> 204.96]  Yeah.
[205.10 --> 206.28]  So, okay, fine then.
[206.34 --> 208.52]  So being on hold is fine, but then...
[208.52 --> 209.98]  I was totally chill the whole time.
[209.98 --> 210.48]  Really?
[210.84 --> 211.74]  But what about...
[211.74 --> 213.00]  Like, what about the...
[213.00 --> 213.68]  Okay, fine.
[214.20 --> 215.28]  What about them scamming you?
[215.36 --> 215.58]  Sure.
[215.78 --> 216.24]  Yeah, how about that?
[216.24 --> 221.12]  I didn't even realize how many times they asked me if I wanted to buy a warranty, if I'm being honest with you.
[221.26 --> 225.32]  I was just like so focused on making sure that I didn't seem nervous in the video.
[225.32 --> 228.76]  That like, I was totally chill during the whole call.
[228.92 --> 231.12]  I had no idea how many times they asked for warranty.
[232.08 --> 233.90]  You must have known it was more than once, though.
[233.90 --> 234.34]  Yes.
[235.40 --> 236.20]  Yes, definitely.
[236.50 --> 240.26]  I kept looking over at Jake and he was giving me the look like, you know.
[240.86 --> 241.84]  It's so funny.
[242.22 --> 249.40]  Because when I was watching the footage back, I was even just like, wow, she is like such a professional.
[249.98 --> 251.06]  Like, you were just...
[251.06 --> 251.92]  You were honestly...
[251.92 --> 256.56]  You were a better phone representative than half of the phone representatives that you talked to.
[256.62 --> 258.68]  You were just like, oh, no, thank you.
[258.76 --> 259.26]  I'm good.
[259.34 --> 259.98]  Thank you.
[259.98 --> 260.58]  So...
[260.58 --> 263.44]  I did customer service for like three years.
[263.64 --> 267.96]  So it's just ingrained in my brain to be nice to whoever you're talking to.
[268.18 --> 270.12]  And so that's just the kind of person I am now.
[270.54 --> 272.20]  So, okay, fine then.
[272.32 --> 274.28]  I'm going to wait and see if...
[274.28 --> 277.92]  Actually, okay, we do have a couple of questions from people.
[279.44 --> 284.50]  Leland over on Floatplane asks, I mean, would you have felt different about it if you had spent your own $1,500?
[285.10 --> 288.42]  Was part of it that this was just like company money, la-di-da, whatever.
[288.54 --> 289.22]  It doesn't really matter.
[289.22 --> 290.68]  I'm being paid right now.
[291.64 --> 295.42]  I mean, the thing is, is I don't know anything really about PCs.
[295.70 --> 298.06]  So I didn't know what I was buying in the first place.
[298.66 --> 304.60]  So like if I was going into it knowing what I needed to buy, then obviously I would feel differently.
[305.62 --> 309.98]  But like during the call, it was fine.
[310.44 --> 311.82]  You're just totally chill.
[312.70 --> 314.34]  Okay, that's fair.
[314.34 --> 316.48]  Did you ever get the bacon scented face masks?
[316.60 --> 318.12]  Asks Digidude 512.
[318.12 --> 320.50]  No, they were sold out.
[321.24 --> 322.04]  Oh, really?
[322.10 --> 323.22]  You did try to buy it?
[323.62 --> 324.10]  Yeah.
[324.50 --> 325.48]  That is fantastic.
[325.48 --> 326.76]  And it was interesting.
[327.10 --> 327.58]  I don't know.
[329.98 --> 330.72]  I love it.
[330.72 --> 331.76]  Worth looking into, I guess.
[331.76 --> 332.96]  Okay.
[332.96 --> 336.88]  Has the experience made you feel like learning to build your own PC?
[337.38 --> 338.48]  This is one of my questions.
[339.94 --> 346.50]  So I actually do have a PC of my own, but I had a lot of guidance when I was building it.
[348.14 --> 349.60]  But you did build it yourself?
[349.60 --> 351.36]  I did build it.
[351.52 --> 351.82]  Really?
[352.06 --> 352.50]  Oh, okay.
[353.06 --> 353.36]  Yes.
[353.48 --> 353.78]  Yes.
[353.86 --> 356.48]  I just had like a ton of direction.
[357.30 --> 357.68]  I didn't.
[357.88 --> 358.30]  Okay.
[358.36 --> 359.74]  I wasn't building it by myself.
[359.92 --> 360.96]  I had somebody with me.
[361.52 --> 362.54]  And so we were building it together.
[362.54 --> 365.74]  But it was basically me watching them build my PC for me.
[365.74 --> 366.18]  Okay.
[366.90 --> 370.58]  That's why when I'm like pulling out the RAM sticks in the video, I have no idea what I'm
[370.58 --> 370.88]  doing.
[371.00 --> 374.42]  Because like, honestly, I haven't really done it before.
[374.78 --> 375.08]  Yeah.
[376.84 --> 378.22]  I mean, even as...
[378.22 --> 378.54]  And that GPU.
[379.06 --> 380.88]  That was pretty crunchy to watch.
[381.42 --> 382.40]  I mean, even as...
[382.40 --> 385.08]  I think I felt physical pain watching that section.
[385.28 --> 387.44]  And I think a lot of the audience probably did as well.
[387.64 --> 388.20]  That was...
[388.20 --> 388.36]  Yeah.
[388.80 --> 394.02]  As someone who's made a brand out of like manhandling hardware on camera and like kind
[394.02 --> 399.08]  of memeing that stuff up, even for me watching that was like, ooh.
[402.30 --> 404.20]  I learned from the best, I guess.
[408.06 --> 408.78]  Don't lie.
[408.88 --> 409.88]  You don't watch the videos.
[409.88 --> 414.94]  Hey, that one RAM stick that I dropped, you were behind me.
[415.04 --> 416.72]  So like, I blame you for that.
[416.90 --> 417.28]  Uh-huh.
[417.40 --> 417.74]  Uh-huh.
[417.82 --> 419.64]  I don't even think you knew I was there.
[420.44 --> 420.64]  Yeah.
[420.82 --> 422.08]  I mean, she dropped RAM stick.
[422.18 --> 423.04]  You threw RAM stick.
[423.14 --> 423.48]  I don't know.
[423.64 --> 424.50]  I don't know which is worse.
[424.98 --> 425.24]  Okay.
[425.40 --> 430.94]  Nerdum asks, oh, if you guys are just tuning in, we've got Sarah, our one and only secret
[430.94 --> 431.32]  shopper.
[431.40 --> 432.60]  Actually, we have two secret shoppers.
[432.70 --> 434.64]  We've had Agent Janice and Agent Sarah now.
[434.96 --> 438.86]  But she just wrapped up the latest run of Secret Shopper.
[438.86 --> 443.54]  So she's asking questions or answering questions from the audience about what the experience
[443.54 --> 444.02]  was like.
[444.02 --> 447.32]  Nerdum over on Floatplane asks, do you actually love roosters?
[449.48 --> 451.08]  Sorry, I had to throw that at you.
[451.10 --> 451.16]  I love animals.
[451.68 --> 454.80]  The entire comment section of that video was like.
[455.16 --> 455.54]  Yes.
[456.00 --> 456.48]  Don't worry.
[456.48 --> 461.00]  I intentionally made that innuendo, actually, if I'm being honest with you.
[461.66 --> 464.46]  But I do love animals just to answer that question.
[465.12 --> 465.74]  All right.
[465.80 --> 466.56]  There we go.
[466.80 --> 469.04]  Roosters are in the vein of that.
[469.56 --> 470.20]  Got it.
[471.94 --> 472.50]  Psycho.
[472.70 --> 473.10]  I have one.
[473.16 --> 473.46]  I have one.
[473.54 --> 473.78]  I have one.
[473.86 --> 474.04]  Yeah.
[474.10 --> 474.40]  Hit me.
[474.54 --> 474.68]  Yeah.
[474.68 --> 476.32]  So you have a computer.
[476.44 --> 480.16]  But if you need to buy a new computer and you decide to go the route of buying a pre-built
[480.16 --> 483.36]  after this experience, which one of those brands would you go with?
[483.92 --> 485.26]  Oh, that's a good question.
[487.44 --> 491.94]  So if I'm being honest, I can barely remember which companies I've been talking to.
[494.30 --> 494.94]  All right.
[495.10 --> 496.10]  I mean, yeah, sure.
[496.10 --> 499.52]  Didn't Origin do good or something?
[501.40 --> 502.38]  Well, okay.
[502.48 --> 507.80]  It kind of depends on how you, it depends on how you interpret it.
[508.28 --> 508.38]  Yeah.
[508.48 --> 510.84]  Origin did a great job of the customer service.
[511.00 --> 515.80]  You really liked the Origin people, but they shipped you a really slow computer.
[516.18 --> 519.72]  If you want it to show up perfectly, but you don't really care what it actually is,
[519.78 --> 520.10]  then yeah.
[520.20 --> 520.60]  Fantastic.
[520.80 --> 521.12]  Yeah.
[521.24 --> 521.42]  Yeah.
[521.42 --> 522.04]  It was in a crate.
[522.66 --> 523.88]  They gave you a $50.
[523.88 --> 524.84]  I like RGB.
[524.84 --> 528.16]  They gave you a $50 prepaid visa for some reason.
[528.34 --> 529.40]  And a t-shirt, right?
[529.68 --> 530.08]  Yeah.
[530.62 --> 535.80]  Instead of just $50 off the computer in the first place, which might have been smarter.
[537.20 --> 537.60]  Okay.
[537.74 --> 540.28]  But for real, I don't think I'd ever buy a pre-build.
[540.48 --> 541.66]  I'm a really crafty person.
[541.66 --> 545.64]  So I'd love to actually build a PC on my own without guidance.
[545.84 --> 547.74]  Just kind of do it.
[547.96 --> 548.28]  Okay.
[549.46 --> 549.78]  Interesting.
[550.14 --> 553.84]  So audience, audience, what do you guys think of this as a video concept?
[553.84 --> 564.78]  We do a follow-up to Secret Shopper, where instead of Sarah putting all of her time and effort into dealing with shady sales reps,
[565.18 --> 571.98]  she puts her time and effort into, with nothing but Linus Tech Tips videos, researching the parts.
[572.18 --> 576.86]  We actually make her research the parts herself and building the PC herself.
[576.86 --> 580.62]  So it's like a two-part shoot.
[580.62 --> 587.70]  And then maybe what we could do to kind of simulate the experience of just being like a random that just wants to build a computer.
[587.94 --> 593.58]  You have like kind of lifelines, but they're in the form of like forum or Reddit posts or something like that.
[593.58 --> 602.32]  So I'm sitting there on like the other end of like a chat or like you, you literally have to go online as tech tips forum or something like that and post your questions.
[602.32 --> 612.48]  And if people are too slow, like I can step in and answer them, but you otherwise have to completely go through the process and then decide at the end, would you do it yourself completely yourself without help?
[612.48 --> 615.54]  Or would you just buy a pre-built for what the difference in price is?
[615.54 --> 619.30]  I feel like you should, I feel like you should have her forum handle be anonymous.
[620.14 --> 620.66]  Yeah.
[621.62 --> 626.80]  Because if it's a real, and maybe yours is too, and you can answer to help.
[627.26 --> 631.30]  But you won't know if it's a good answer from me or if it's just some random.
[632.92 --> 635.16]  That would be so much fun.
[635.44 --> 636.06]  Oh my gosh.
[636.24 --> 636.92]  Can we do that?
[637.18 --> 640.68]  And you guys should have a baseline one that's also built by like Jake or someone.
[641.34 --> 643.90]  And then like test them at the end and see how they compare.
[643.90 --> 646.34]  I kind of like it.
[646.42 --> 646.82]  All right.
[647.06 --> 648.18]  We'll have to give you a budget.
[648.42 --> 648.90]  Same thing.
[648.96 --> 651.10]  Just because it's like, it's too easy if there's no budget.
[651.20 --> 652.32]  That's not really even fun.
[652.72 --> 653.52]  I've got a question.
[653.80 --> 654.70]  And people would have a budget.
[655.02 --> 655.10]  Yeah.
[655.28 --> 657.66]  I've got a question from HP Deskjet 500.
[657.88 --> 661.82]  Hey, Sarah, what are your thoughts on Secret Shopper basically turning you into a meme?
[663.60 --> 665.34]  I think this guy follows me on Twitter.
[665.58 --> 666.90]  I see his tweets all the time.
[668.06 --> 670.56]  I am fine with it, I guess.
[670.56 --> 672.32]  I never thought I would reach meme level.
[672.32 --> 673.92]  But like, Linus, watch out.
[673.98 --> 674.96]  I'm coming for you.
[675.08 --> 676.16]  Oh, I know, right?
[676.60 --> 678.32]  I'm trying to find it right now.
[678.40 --> 680.46]  I don't know what the typical caption is for it.
[680.50 --> 680.86]  But it is.
[680.94 --> 681.76]  Oh, yeah, here it is.
[682.04 --> 682.42]  All right.
[682.46 --> 684.94]  Here, I'm just going to flip over to my display capture here.
[685.04 --> 687.50]  This is freaking amazing.
[687.50 --> 688.40]  This picture.
[689.04 --> 690.80]  Like, what even is that?
[690.92 --> 692.34]  It's what?
[692.46 --> 695.02]  I don't even know what part of the video that was from.
[695.68 --> 697.08]  It's from when I dropped the GPU.
[697.74 --> 698.94]  Oh, that's right.
[699.06 --> 699.62]  Hold on a second.
[699.62 --> 700.14]  There it is.
[700.20 --> 700.62]  There it is.
[700.62 --> 701.88]  So there's Sarah.
[703.38 --> 704.00]  Got it.
[704.10 --> 704.54]  Okay.
[704.74 --> 705.68]  Yeah, fantastic.
[705.90 --> 708.66]  It's absolutely freaking amazing.
[708.88 --> 710.76]  Like, what were you?
[710.84 --> 712.60]  What was going through your head at that moment?
[714.24 --> 718.08]  I mean, I was literally just as cringe as anybody else watching that video.
[718.34 --> 720.72]  That's my cringe face to me dropping the GPU.
[721.52 --> 723.20]  Like, I knew it was bad.
[723.20 --> 726.06]  I know the GPU is one of the most expensive parts of the computer.
[726.06 --> 728.44]  And I was just like, oh.
[729.08 --> 730.54]  It was so bad.
[730.72 --> 731.62]  Oh, my goodness.
[732.28 --> 732.74]  All right.
[733.18 --> 733.54]  Yeah.
[734.62 --> 735.26]  All right.
[735.50 --> 736.88]  Oh, this is a question for me.
[736.96 --> 738.16]  Where did you work as a CSR?
[738.16 --> 742.20]  I feel like I should know this because, you know, I probably saw your resume at some point
[742.20 --> 742.54]  or another.
[742.68 --> 744.46]  But actually, maybe I didn't.
[744.54 --> 745.54]  Maybe I never saw your resume.
[745.64 --> 747.46]  I don't think I was involved in hiring you at all, was I?
[748.08 --> 748.56]  No, you were.
[749.66 --> 751.08]  Yeah, that explains how it happened.
[751.20 --> 753.60]  That's how we end up with all these Gen Zs around here.
[754.06 --> 755.56]  I think I was consulted.
[755.56 --> 761.94]  I think I was sort of given, like, a description of you and then the other top candidate.
[762.50 --> 767.54]  And it was like, okay, do you want the one that's, like, lots of raw potential, like,
[767.58 --> 771.22]  good dragon energy, but, like, kind of random?
[771.52 --> 776.54]  Or do you want the one that's, like, experienced and professional, but probably not as much, like,
[776.66 --> 777.38]  dragon energy?
[777.76 --> 781.24]  And then I'm not going to tell you which one you were because I would never comment on an
[781.24 --> 783.84]  HR decision, you know, on a live stream like this.
[783.84 --> 786.66]  But where exactly did you work?
[787.92 --> 792.14]  So I worked at a restaurant called Mr. Mike's for a while as a hostess.
[792.90 --> 796.20]  So you really learn to deal with people when you work in a restaurant.
[796.78 --> 798.14]  Because nobody's ever happy.
[798.76 --> 802.16]  And then I also worked at a thrift store for a while.
[802.80 --> 804.08]  So, yeah.
[804.20 --> 804.54]  Really?
[804.72 --> 805.68]  It's a vibe, yeah.
[805.76 --> 807.42]  I'm going to pop some tags.
[807.54 --> 809.70]  Only got $20 in my pocket.
[810.36 --> 812.00]  You don't even know what song I'm singing, do you?
[812.06 --> 813.44]  You have no idea what song I'm singing.
[813.44 --> 814.52]  No, I don't believe you.
[814.54 --> 816.04]  It's thrift shop by Macklemore.
[816.56 --> 817.30]  Fine, fine.
[817.44 --> 817.74]  All right.
[817.92 --> 818.24]  Okay.
[819.02 --> 819.28]  All right.
[819.28 --> 822.54]  Well, I had no reason to think that you would know what that song is.
[822.58 --> 823.62]  It's from before you were born.
[824.56 --> 826.20]  No, it's not.
[828.58 --> 830.96]  I was going to say, I think that's a bit of a boomer song, though.
[831.06 --> 831.28]  Yeah.
[831.74 --> 832.10]  2012.
[832.32 --> 832.66]  2012.
[832.98 --> 833.26]  2012.
[833.26 --> 833.34]  2012.
[833.42 --> 834.76]  I'm pretty sure you weren't born yet.
[834.76 --> 838.90]  Oh, man.
[839.12 --> 839.66]  All right.
[839.68 --> 841.82]  What else we got here in the float plane chat?
[842.88 --> 844.18]  Oh, man.
[844.22 --> 845.64]  It's just like tons of spam.
[845.78 --> 846.08]  OMG.
[846.26 --> 846.46]  Yes.
[846.50 --> 848.20]  We have to do that video concept.
[848.96 --> 852.70]  Do you just want to tell, is there anything that you wanted to say that you felt didn't
[852.70 --> 853.86]  come across in the videos?
[853.86 --> 856.40]  Um, okay.
[856.44 --> 861.10]  I got accused a lot of, like, helping out one of the people too much.
[861.28 --> 861.84]  You did.
[861.84 --> 865.80]  About telling him that I haven't checked the ramstick yet.
[865.92 --> 869.32]  But, like, during my call at the beginning, he said, this could be the problem.
[869.42 --> 870.40]  This could be the problem.
[870.54 --> 871.82]  The ramstick could be the problem.
[872.08 --> 874.26]  And so I just thought I would, like, bring that back up.
[875.58 --> 876.20]  You did.
[876.22 --> 878.64]  So I was not really helping him because he did suggest it.
[878.76 --> 880.78]  You were pretty helpful in some places.
[880.94 --> 883.22]  You were, like, very helpful in some cases.
[883.22 --> 887.48]  And I was like, honestly, though, none of the ones where you were super helpful ended
[887.48 --> 888.56]  up winning it anyway.
[889.00 --> 890.98]  So clearly it wasn't good enough.
[892.82 --> 895.20]  I just like helping people, you know.
[895.80 --> 899.82]  It was painful to, like, know exactly what was wrong with the computer.
[900.20 --> 901.74]  And them, like, trying.
[902.50 --> 904.12]  Probably not their hardest, honestly.
[904.30 --> 904.86]  But trying.
[905.88 --> 907.98]  I wanted to be able to help them.
[909.80 --> 910.76]  That's about it.
[911.98 --> 912.76]  All right.
[913.22 --> 915.14]  Let me have a look.
[915.88 --> 916.54]  Speed Demon.
[916.74 --> 918.34]  Someone brought up Sarah versus Dennis.
[918.72 --> 919.70]  Sarah versus Dennis.
[919.84 --> 921.14]  I already know Sarah would win.
[921.68 --> 922.38]  Like, oh, man.
[922.50 --> 924.64]  Dennis has even built multiple computers.
[925.02 --> 932.40]  And still, when I watched Dennis, did you see Dennis' video where he collabed with Anthony?
[932.40 --> 941.74]  Anthony was, like, instructing him through, like, FPV goggles and a camera that was installed
[941.74 --> 942.72]  on Dennis' forehead.
[943.20 --> 945.86]  And then Dennis is blindfolded trying to build a computer.
[946.62 --> 947.16]  And it was just.
[947.72 --> 949.36]  He actually broke the motherboard.
[949.56 --> 950.14]  Like, I had to go.
[950.24 --> 952.32]  I had to re-bend a bunch of pins in the socket after.
[952.64 --> 953.50]  It was painful.
[953.50 --> 960.24]  Meanwhile, me and Yvonne just, like, absolutely slayed it because she knows how to follow
[960.24 --> 961.22]  basic instructions.
[961.22 --> 963.94]  Like, it was so hard to watch, man.
[964.40 --> 965.48]  So hard to watch.
[966.56 --> 968.92]  That video has a terrible like-dislike ratio.
[969.02 --> 972.50]  Not because I think that it's not entertaining, but I think people just couldn't.
[972.50 --> 974.70]  People don't like broken hardware, too.
[975.02 --> 976.12]  I think they just couldn't.
[976.28 --> 977.28]  I thought it was just too hard.
[977.28 --> 980.04]  All right.
[981.28 --> 985.96]  Which one of the, which one of the things, ooh, this is interesting.
[986.26 --> 988.68]  If you were buying your own, let's say you were buying a pre-built.
[988.98 --> 993.68]  Out of everything we tested, which one do you think is the most important to you after
[993.68 --> 995.46]  the fact, after going through this with everyone?
[996.00 --> 1001.74]  Initial sales, tech support, or the actual value of the product?
[1002.08 --> 1004.16]  Like, which one holds the most weight for you?
[1004.16 --> 1007.56]  I think the actual value of the product.
[1007.72 --> 1011.50]  Because, like, in the end, you want to make sure you're getting your money's worth of whatever
[1011.50 --> 1012.18]  you're buying.
[1013.44 --> 1015.36]  Like, customer support is important.
[1015.54 --> 1020.44]  But, like, there's videos, like, we have on YouTube where if you really need help fixing
[1020.44 --> 1023.12]  something, you can just, like, look it up.
[1024.60 --> 1029.62]  And then, like, buying something over the phone doesn't really happen anymore.
[1029.62 --> 1036.52]  So, yeah, I think value is the most important part of, like, the whole Secret Shopper series.
[1036.64 --> 1042.78]  Ms. Butt, are you critiquing the methodology of our Secret Shopper series?
[1044.96 --> 1046.10]  I'm not the only one.
[1047.00 --> 1050.06]  But I think that what we're doing is important.
[1050.06 --> 1056.28]  I think what we're doing is important because we are showing companies what they're like
[1056.28 --> 1058.38]  to a regular customer.
[1059.18 --> 1064.74]  Whether that's over the phone or through email, usually customer support is pretty similar.
[1065.22 --> 1066.52]  So, I don't know.
[1067.06 --> 1071.56]  I am critiquing it, but, like, not harshly.
[1071.56 --> 1077.24]  Maybe for part three, it should have to be another, like, uninformed purchaser.
[1077.72 --> 1079.90]  And they have to go through the online system.
[1081.04 --> 1084.44]  And, like, whatever system they end up with is the system that they end up with.
[1084.62 --> 1088.16]  And that's how you grade, essentially, their configurator.
[1088.34 --> 1093.16]  I'll tell you right now, the reason we do it the way that we do it is more for, like,
[1093.20 --> 1095.34]  a production, for production purposes.
[1095.34 --> 1099.40]  Not because I think that's necessarily how everyone would go and buy a computer.
[1099.40 --> 1105.16]  The reason is that, Luke, as you and I have experienced during Scrapyard Wars time and
[1105.16 --> 1112.58]  time again, the first episode of a Scrapyard Wars series is always just, like, us with
[1112.58 --> 1116.52]  our heads, our faces buried in our computers, shopping online.
[1116.66 --> 1117.64]  And it's not entertaining.
[1117.84 --> 1118.70]  It's not interesting.
[1119.16 --> 1120.06]  Whereas...
[1120.06 --> 1124.22]  If we were able to go through a physical market, it would be a lot more interesting,
[1124.58 --> 1124.98]  for sure.
[1125.28 --> 1129.24]  Meanwhile, if you're talking to someone on the phone, it's, like,
[1129.40 --> 1130.42]  comedy gold.
[1130.58 --> 1134.00]  Because it is amazing how bad a job these companies do.
[1134.42 --> 1139.32]  And from my point of view, we're evaluating a service that they claim to offer.
[1139.80 --> 1144.94]  If you have a sales line, then someone who knows what they're doing should pick it up
[1144.94 --> 1149.00]  and advise you in a way that is, you know, not deceptive.
[1149.56 --> 1150.72]  It's that simple.
[1151.16 --> 1151.80]  So, yeah.
[1151.90 --> 1154.22]  I see the point that you guys are making.
[1154.22 --> 1156.78]  And it's not the first time we've gotten this feedback.
[1157.04 --> 1158.88]  It's just, that's why we do it.
[1158.94 --> 1160.98]  We do it to make more entertaining content.
[1161.24 --> 1164.14]  And because it's not an invalid way to buy a computer.
[1164.66 --> 1165.24]  What it also does...
[1165.92 --> 1166.28]  Oh, sorry.
[1166.34 --> 1166.58]  Go ahead.
[1167.12 --> 1167.34]  Nope.
[1167.42 --> 1167.82]  Finished it off.
[1167.86 --> 1167.98]  Sorry.
[1168.14 --> 1168.54]  I thought you were done.
[1168.54 --> 1175.34]  What it also does is it reveals, you know, how these companies behave in the situation
[1175.34 --> 1179.82]  that allows them to apply the most pressure to the customer.
[1180.14 --> 1186.46]  It's much more difficult to apply a high-pressure sales tactic to someone who is over email
[1186.46 --> 1190.94]  or over live chat where they can just easily ghost you than it is when you're on the phone.
[1191.08 --> 1194.50]  Once you have someone on the phone, you are a lot closer to making a sale.
[1194.58 --> 1196.88]  And that's just, like, basic sales principles.
[1196.88 --> 1203.34]  So, these companies that do have extremely robust and mature sales strategies are going
[1203.34 --> 1205.90]  to know that they can go after you harder when you're on the phone.
[1206.10 --> 1210.10]  So, that's a third reason that I thought of on the spot, but it's a very valid one for
[1210.10 --> 1211.80]  us continuing to do it the way that we do.
[1212.90 --> 1213.26]  Totally.
[1213.54 --> 1215.74]  And you don't get to hear roosters if you're not over the phone.
[1215.80 --> 1216.54]  That's right.
[1217.68 --> 1218.04]  Exactly.
[1219.56 --> 1221.04]  Or get scammed by Dell as easily.
[1221.04 --> 1225.86]  I have a question for each of you, actually.
[1226.00 --> 1227.44]  And they're actually different questions.
[1227.58 --> 1230.20]  And one of them is not related to this project at all.
[1230.24 --> 1231.10]  But I'm going to ask it first.
[1231.42 --> 1231.64]  Got it.
[1232.22 --> 1237.36]  Sarah, what is your favorite piece of merch that you have done design work on?
[1237.42 --> 1239.64]  Oh, is she going to spoil the one that I'm about to announce?
[1241.10 --> 1242.12]  I don't have to.
[1242.28 --> 1242.50]  Probably not.
[1242.50 --> 1243.64]  I don't think that's my favorite.
[1244.88 --> 1249.04]  I loved doing the folding at home t-shirt because it was for a great initiative.
[1250.00 --> 1251.80]  We were able to raise lots of money.
[1252.26 --> 1253.66]  We raised a ton of money, Sarah.
[1254.00 --> 1255.66]  Like, 60 grand or something like that?
[1255.72 --> 1256.32]  It was crazy.
[1258.54 --> 1260.68]  And also, it's just cool seeing...
[1260.68 --> 1262.72]  I think that was the first t-shirt design that I did.
[1263.16 --> 1266.58]  And it was really cool for me to see people around the office wearing it.
[1267.64 --> 1270.06]  Because, like, I've never done a project like that before.
[1270.06 --> 1271.76]  So, being able to see...
[1271.76 --> 1275.80]  And then also people, like, tweeting pictures of them with their new folding at home t-shirt.
[1275.92 --> 1277.66]  I was like, is this what it's like?
[1279.14 --> 1280.88]  That was a lot of fun.
[1280.94 --> 1282.76]  You know what's going to be a blast for you?
[1283.00 --> 1288.34]  Like, just absolutely going to blow your mind is when we can finally do LTX again.
[1288.88 --> 1291.28]  And you are walking around on the floor at LTX.
[1291.50 --> 1294.66]  And people are just, like, decked out in your designs.
[1295.10 --> 1295.70]  It's crazy.
[1295.98 --> 1296.18]  Yeah.
[1296.34 --> 1299.20]  It's going to be super fun.
[1299.20 --> 1303.72]  Like, Lloyd, I remember talking to him after LTX in 2019.
[1304.36 --> 1307.32]  And he was just like, this is pretty cool.
[1307.50 --> 1311.02]  Because as a designer, I mean, obviously, it's nice to get paid.
[1311.76 --> 1313.02]  You know, everybody needs to make money.
[1313.48 --> 1323.36]  But as a designer, just like for me as, like, a content creator, like, it's only so much fun to make videos if I'm just throwing them out into a void and nobody's watching them.
[1323.36 --> 1328.58]  It's only so much fun to design stuff that you think is cool, but it's really validating to see a bunch of people agree.
[1329.06 --> 1337.88]  And because it's going to be so long before another LTX, man, there are going to be a lot of Sarah designs walking around on the show floor.
[1338.02 --> 1342.58]  And then people are going to start walking up to you and asking you to sign them, which is like a whole other level of surreal.
[1342.88 --> 1343.70]  Are you ready?
[1343.70 --> 1344.06]  Yeah.
[1344.68 --> 1345.60]  I don't know.
[1345.74 --> 1346.38]  I really don't know.
[1346.40 --> 1347.04]  You're signing your own art.
[1348.34 --> 1353.96]  Even just releasing this, like, when it launched, I was just like, I illustrated an ABC book.
[1354.26 --> 1356.94]  Like, I don't know how many people who get to say that in their lifetime.
[1357.14 --> 1358.58]  And, like, that's super special for me.
[1358.72 --> 1360.42]  I still need to stock up on a few of those.
[1360.42 --> 1363.76]  And we've sold thousands of them, which is pretty cool.
[1364.10 --> 1364.46]  That's insane.
[1364.74 --> 1364.90]  Yeah.
[1364.90 --> 1365.26]  Insane.
[1365.54 --> 1366.08]  Pretty sick.
[1366.32 --> 1367.04]  LTxtore.com.
[1367.68 --> 1367.88]  Okay.
[1367.96 --> 1369.48]  Question for Linus now.
[1369.64 --> 1369.86]  Oh.
[1370.22 --> 1372.58]  And back more on topic, I guess.
[1372.58 --> 1372.74]  Fine.
[1372.92 --> 1373.08]  Yep.
[1373.20 --> 1373.44]  Hit me.
[1373.84 --> 1377.20]  Have any of those companies reached out since then?
[1377.26 --> 1381.40]  Have you talked to Dell, essentially, but also have any of the other companies reached out?
[1382.10 --> 1386.72]  I don't think Main Gear has done anything as crazy as last time.
[1386.72 --> 1393.44]  I think last time they, like, put out a press release talking about how we praised their customer service and stuff like that.
[1393.52 --> 1396.26]  I don't think they've done that this year, but I haven't paid attention.
[1396.84 --> 1397.66]  iBuyBower tweeted.
[1398.00 --> 1399.38]  They were very proud of themselves.
[1399.60 --> 1401.76]  I mean, they've won two years in a row, so they should be.
[1401.76 --> 1406.22]  Um, you know, they definitely had some things to fix, and they acknowledged that in their tweet.
[1406.32 --> 1416.18]  They said, hey, here's the, like, three or four things that we agree we could do better on, but we're super proud that we have two crowns in a row now, and we're looking forward to another one.
[1416.18 --> 1417.68]  So they were jazzed.
[1417.68 --> 1421.66]  As for Dell, I've seen them go on the defense on Twitter a little bit.
[1421.74 --> 1426.52]  They've acknowledged it, both on the Alienware handle and the Dell cares handle, I think.
[1426.52 --> 1433.04]  Um, but they have not actually, like, contacted us, to my knowledge.
[1433.04 --> 1438.16]  So, what do you think about, and this is, we're maybe getting into the weeds here a little bit.
[1438.24 --> 1438.46]  Sure.
[1438.58 --> 1441.40]  Um, but they legitimately scammed you.
[1441.74 --> 1442.04]  Yeah.
[1442.22 --> 1445.64]  Like, uh, are you gonna go after them?
[1445.98 --> 1446.28]  No.
[1446.58 --> 1447.84]  That's not my jam.
[1448.02 --> 1450.60]  I mean, if I was, I was way more mad.
[1450.60 --> 1455.62]  Like, completely outside of the, like, business relations stuff, they stole your money.
[1455.84 --> 1456.34]  Sort of.
[1457.04 --> 1460.42]  So, here's where Dell, I think, gets off the hook.
[1460.72 --> 1466.84]  If I was the litigious sort, um, I got an invoice that had those items on it.
[1467.48 --> 1469.64]  So, there's...
[1469.64 --> 1470.70]  Before you paid for it?
[1470.72 --> 1471.12]  Is that correct?
[1471.40 --> 1472.88]  Uh, no, I don't think so.
[1472.94 --> 1474.14]  I think I had paid for it.
[1474.20 --> 1479.04]  But, I think that given that those items were on the invoice,
[1479.04 --> 1482.20]  they can basically pull up the paper trail and say,
[1482.30 --> 1484.22]  look, we provided an invoice.
[1484.44 --> 1490.10]  We delivered exactly what it said on the invoice at the price that is shown on Dell.com
[1490.10 --> 1491.32]  to within a couple of dollars.
[1491.76 --> 1493.42]  Uh, we are, we are all good.
[1493.72 --> 1494.58]  Everything is all good.
[1495.08 --> 1496.86]  Um, I think they'd get away with it.
[1496.94 --> 1502.16]  And I think that's where, that's where we were actually very close to changing the title of part four
[1502.16 --> 1508.42]  to, uh, Dell defrauded us instead of Dell scammed us, uh, or something like that.
[1508.42 --> 1510.16]  Uh, I think that's what we settled on.
[1510.16 --> 1512.78]  I don't know enough stuff about legal things to comment on that, but that sounds...
[1512.78 --> 1517.40]  So, scam, scam is not like, uh, like a legal term to my knowledge.
[1517.56 --> 1519.38]  It's more of like a colloquial term.
[1519.46 --> 1521.80]  They definitely, like, they ripped us off.
[1522.00 --> 1522.86]  They scammed us.
[1522.86 --> 1522.88]  Oh, yeah.
[1523.36 --> 1523.54]  Yeah.
[1523.54 --> 1526.98]  But I don't think we could say that they defrauded us.
[1527.24 --> 1531.88]  And honestly, I was far more angry, um, about the Apple situation.
[1531.88 --> 1535.48]  When we broke the computer, which we were always upfront about,
[1535.56 --> 1539.86]  it's been extremely frustrating over the years to see people come back at us
[1539.86 --> 1543.18]  and say that we were expecting some kind of handout from Apple.
[1543.38 --> 1545.82]  We were not expecting a handout.
[1545.82 --> 1547.96]  We walked into the Apple store and said,
[1548.22 --> 1549.90]  hey, we broke this.
[1550.62 --> 1552.26]  You guys are the manufacturer.
[1552.62 --> 1554.80]  We would like to pay you to fix it.
[1554.98 --> 1557.38]  We understand that this is going to cost money.
[1557.38 --> 1562.92]  But as the manufacturer, we believe, however naively that might have been,
[1563.00 --> 1567.30]  we believe that you have the tools and the know-how to fix your own d*** product.
[1567.70 --> 1568.90]  That's what happened.
[1569.26 --> 1573.58]  And they sent us away and there was no solution.
[1574.00 --> 1578.30]  And what made that particularly infuriating was that was a professional product.
[1578.44 --> 1580.10]  That is a different can of worms.
[1580.54 --> 1584.96]  When some consumer desktop is sold with a high-pressure sales tactic
[1584.96 --> 1589.74]  and antivirus and, uh, you know, what was the other thing?
[1589.82 --> 1591.50]  And warranty that I didn't want.
[1591.80 --> 1593.86]  That's like, yeah, what else is new?
[1594.44 --> 1600.26]  When a professional product has absolutely no recourse whatsoever,
[1600.26 --> 1604.08]  if it is broken, that is not okay.
[1604.74 --> 1608.30]  That is something that could be, aside from the cost of the product,
[1608.38 --> 1610.22]  and it was an expensive product, iMac Pro.
[1610.66 --> 1613.94]  Aside from the cost of the product, there is an opportunity cost.
[1613.94 --> 1618.82]  There is a business interruption cost to not having that equipment running potentially.
[1618.98 --> 1622.90]  Now, luckily, I'm in a situation where I don't really need that iMac Pro that badly.
[1623.16 --> 1625.38]  My business can run just fine without it.
[1625.68 --> 1629.88]  But if I was a small-time, you know, freelance videographer or something,
[1630.42 --> 1633.36]  and that thing, like, didn't work, and maybe it was my bad.
[1633.48 --> 1634.20]  Maybe it was.
[1634.52 --> 1637.74]  There should be a way to fix it if I am able to pay for it.
[1638.06 --> 1639.98]  That was why I was so mad.
[1639.98 --> 1642.14]  But, so, I don't know.
[1642.20 --> 1645.14]  To me, maybe I'm just desensitized to it.
[1645.36 --> 1648.38]  It's not because I have any kind of, like, special place in my heart for Dell.
[1648.44 --> 1649.10]  Don't get me wrong.
[1649.48 --> 1651.38]  I just, I don't know.
[1651.48 --> 1655.42]  I've bought enough things at Future Shop, which is what Best Buy here used to be called.
[1656.04 --> 1656.60]  Sort of.
[1656.72 --> 1657.26]  It's complicated.
[1657.40 --> 1658.98]  But it was basically Canadian Best Buy.
[1658.98 --> 1668.60]  I've bought enough things at Future Shop and Best Buy and, like, big box stores with commission structures like they have for selling warranty that, like, it just doesn't surprise me at all.
[1669.34 --> 1674.60]  I think anytime you get into charging me more money, I'm going to get a little triggered.
[1674.60 --> 1694.12]  But I think, like, if I was in a Future Shop back in the day and they've got this commission structure and I tell the sales representative five times or whatever it ended up being that I don't want the, whatever it's called.
[1694.24 --> 1694.94]  I don't remember anymore.
[1695.28 --> 1696.30]  PSP or whatever.
[1696.60 --> 1697.46]  Yeah, the PSP.
[1698.00 --> 1700.10]  Product sales plan or product service plan.
[1700.10 --> 1700.80]  Five times.
[1701.16 --> 1709.36]  If I tell them that and then I go to pay and I'm like, huh, this is more expensive than I thought.
[1709.52 --> 1713.44]  I must have miscalculated the tax or something in my head.
[1713.58 --> 1718.20]  And then I walk out and while I'm walking out and look at my receipt and the PSP is on there, I would freak.
[1718.54 --> 1719.76]  But here's the issue.
[1720.10 --> 1725.68]  No matter how much you freak, no matter how mad you are about it, what's the worst that can happen?
[1725.90 --> 1726.64]  What are you going to do?
[1726.70 --> 1727.86]  Take them to small claims court?
[1728.26 --> 1729.88]  It's like absolutely a waste of your time.
[1731.10 --> 1733.36]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[1733.42 --> 1734.04]  There you go.
[1734.48 --> 1735.96]  At least I'd be applying pressure.
[1736.22 --> 1741.32]  See, in this situation, what I would do is I would put them on blast on social media, which kind of happened by default.
[1741.44 --> 1743.14]  So I don't really know what you would do.
[1744.46 --> 1749.44]  My biggest worry is just like people buying computers, not knowing what they're buying.
[1749.44 --> 1756.80]  And then Dell like bringing down the price of the computer just so they can add those like warranties that they don't want.
[1757.30 --> 1758.96]  Well, that's what happened.
[1759.12 --> 1759.48]  Unfair.
[1759.80 --> 1760.56]  Yeah, exactly.
[1760.66 --> 1766.50]  You gave them a budget and they basically, as far as I can tell, the representative maximized their commission.
[1767.46 --> 1768.48]  That was what they did.
[1768.60 --> 1769.50]  They slipped in.
[1769.50 --> 1773.18]  So however they get paid, we don't know exactly what the structure is.
[1773.26 --> 1774.00]  What we know for sure.
[1774.00 --> 1776.62]  Well, OK, we know for sure they get a bonus for selling warranty.
[1777.00 --> 1778.46]  That much was crystal clear.
[1778.58 --> 1778.82]  Absolutely.
[1779.34 --> 1783.68]  What we don't know is if they get more for selling a higher end system, for example, though.
[1783.78 --> 1789.66]  So what they did apparently was they minimized the system because apparently they get less commission from that.
[1789.72 --> 1790.28]  That's what we're guessing.
[1790.62 --> 1793.00]  And then maximized the services that they could put on.
[1793.04 --> 1798.54]  They tried real hard to get you on the financing, but they weren't going to be able to sign you up for credit without you noticing.
[1798.98 --> 1800.54]  So they couldn't slip that in.
[1800.54 --> 1802.58]  They slipped in everything that they could.
[1803.54 --> 1807.54]  And, you know, I don't even blame the sales rep, to be perfectly honest with you.
[1807.54 --> 1814.08]  To me, what that whole experience smelled like was a bad system.
[1814.60 --> 1818.52]  This is a system where Dell is not investigating these problems.
[1818.86 --> 1826.90]  Obviously, this is a system where Dell is incentivizing their salespeople to just badger the customer effectively.
[1827.36 --> 1829.74]  Like it was clearly a trained behavior.
[1829.98 --> 1830.84]  What was happening there?
[1833.22 --> 1834.80]  Oh, there you go.
[1834.80 --> 1839.44]  Two questions that I've got for you, Sarah, at this point.
[1840.16 --> 1845.26]  What do you think your biggest one or maybe few pain points were?
[1845.36 --> 1850.48]  And what do you think your biggest one or maybe few good points of the experience were?
[1852.38 --> 1853.86]  What bothered you the most?
[1855.64 --> 1857.48]  It's hard for me to look at pain points.
[1857.48 --> 1861.56]  Honestly, I always am looking at the positive in any situation.
[1863.24 --> 1868.94]  So, like, I honestly don't.
[1869.04 --> 1869.68]  I'll go back.
[1869.76 --> 1871.54]  I'll go back to my pain points.
[1871.78 --> 1880.84]  And I think my positive experiences during Secret Shopper were just like talking to genuine reps for different companies.
[1880.84 --> 1883.46]  Like the guy who talked about bacon face masks.
[1883.80 --> 1891.40]  Like, I just feel like you want that when you're trying to get help with your computer or trying to get help with anything, really.
[1892.68 --> 1900.56]  Having worked with customer service in the past, though, do you think that that representative would have an issue with other customers?
[1901.62 --> 1902.36]  Like you liked it.
[1902.40 --> 1904.02]  I feel like I would have a good time.
[1904.66 --> 1905.02]  No?
[1905.88 --> 1906.46]  I don't know.
[1907.02 --> 1907.20]  Oh.
[1907.54 --> 1908.32]  I don't think so.
[1908.40 --> 1910.62]  I think that a good rep could have adapted anyway.
[1911.76 --> 1912.64]  Yeah, that's true.
[1913.12 --> 1916.02]  Like, that's part of being a good customer service representative.
[1916.20 --> 1920.82]  Now, I didn't work in the restaurant industry, but I did work sales floor sales in a computer store.
[1921.22 --> 1923.64]  And you got to just develop a sense for it.
[1923.66 --> 1926.30]  Okay, this person doesn't want to make small talk.
[1926.66 --> 1927.06]  Okay.
[1927.40 --> 1927.94]  Yeah, exactly.
[1927.94 --> 1929.18]  You know, let's get down to business.
[1929.18 --> 1931.34]  They just need a cable and they need to get the heck out of here.
[1931.34 --> 1941.20]  Versus, like, this person's, like, doesn't really know the stuff very well and really wants to feel confident before they make their purchase and they need a lot of help.
[1941.38 --> 1943.48]  Or there's the ones that just want affirmation.
[1943.78 --> 1946.84]  They already know what they want, but they just want you to, like, tell them it's a good idea.
[1947.48 --> 1949.28]  And so you'll try to steer them to something else.
[1949.40 --> 1951.56]  Like, I would have, this was a really classic one.
[1951.68 --> 1956.60]  Like, back when I was a sales rep, AMD was on top in terms of price to performance.
[1957.76 --> 1958.84]  And, oh, uh-oh.
[1959.16 --> 1960.22]  Sarah just lost the light.
[1960.22 --> 1960.64]  We're back.
[1960.64 --> 1960.66]  We're back.
[1960.66 --> 1960.74]  We're back.
[1960.74 --> 1961.02]  We're back.
[1962.20 --> 1964.20]  AMD was on top for price to performance.
[1964.80 --> 1965.22]  And, wait, no.
[1965.38 --> 1965.60]  Were they?
[1965.72 --> 1966.20]  Let me think.
[1966.50 --> 1967.64]  Ooh, how far back was I?
[1967.64 --> 1968.40]  When was I sales rep?
[1968.60 --> 1969.08]  I think so.
[1969.56 --> 1969.84]  Whatever.
[1970.06 --> 1970.26]  The point.
[1970.32 --> 1971.06]  Yes, yes, they were.
[1971.38 --> 1975.48]  And you'd have a lot of people coming in because they heard da-da-da-da on TV or whatever.
[1975.82 --> 1978.06]  And they'd be like, okay, I want to buy an Intel CPU.
[1978.50 --> 1982.10]  And you'd say, hey, you know, I really think that you should get this one.
[1982.16 --> 1983.30]  I think you'd be really happy with it.
[1983.30 --> 1984.54]  And they'd go, oh, yeah, you know what?
[1984.54 --> 1985.62]  Thanks for sharing that with me.
[1985.62 --> 1993.04]  But, you know, my brother's cousin's mother's daughter's dad said I should go Intel.
[1993.04 --> 1993.74]  It's the best.
[1994.16 --> 1996.26]  And then you kind of just back off.
[1996.46 --> 2001.78]  Because, you know, at the end of the day, it's above your pay grade to, like, get in arguments with people on the customer.
[2001.78 --> 2003.70]  Or on the sales floor.
[2004.28 --> 2010.18]  And the reality of it is, so what if it's 9% slower in WinZip?
[2010.56 --> 2017.08]  Like, the reality of it is they're going to get a computer that is going to work and probably going to be fine for whatever they need to do.
[2017.16 --> 2019.12]  So, like, at the end of the day, who cares?
[2019.18 --> 2023.16]  As long as you gave them the best information you could, it's sort of, it's their decision.
[2023.30 --> 2023.86]  It's their life.
[2023.92 --> 2024.68]  It's their money, right?
[2025.64 --> 2026.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[2026.26 --> 2026.38]  Exactly.
[2027.64 --> 2033.90]  So, yeah, just talking to personable people was definitely a great part of my experience.
[2034.40 --> 2034.58]  Yeah.
[2034.58 --> 2046.36]  And then that one guy who told me to take out the GPU, it was really funny when he said, like, who knows, it could already be broken.
[2047.22 --> 2055.52]  Like, even though he told me to do the wrong thing, probably shouldn't have let me try to rip out that GPU for as long as he did.
[2055.94 --> 2058.18]  He still made me feel better about myself.
[2058.18 --> 2062.28]  So, I mean, that's a positive and a negative in itself, honestly.
[2062.84 --> 2066.72]  Because, like, for me as a customer, it's different.
[2067.06 --> 2074.04]  As a Zoomer, how obvious was it to you that they should just, like, get on a quick FaceTime or, like, Hangouts call with you?
[2074.48 --> 2074.88]  Like.
[2076.04 --> 2077.80]  That's not even something that I thought about.
[2077.96 --> 2078.38]  Really?
[2079.18 --> 2079.94]  Yeah, truly.
[2080.80 --> 2081.58]  Oh, all right.
[2081.74 --> 2084.52]  I mean, if it was up to me, I wouldn't be calling anybody.
[2084.52 --> 2086.94]  I would see if I could figure out the problem on my own.
[2086.94 --> 2088.46]  Fair enough.
[2088.48 --> 2093.80]  But since that's not the charm of Secret Shopper, obviously, I had to go through the whole process.
[2096.06 --> 2096.58]  Okay.
[2096.80 --> 2098.14]  A bad, bad point.
[2099.26 --> 2106.84]  After seeing that Dell scammed me, or not necessarily scam me, but that made me mad.
[2107.54 --> 2108.48]  That made me mad.
[2108.66 --> 2111.68]  Because they took advantage of me as a paying customer.
[2111.98 --> 2113.30]  And that's really frustrating.
[2113.42 --> 2115.94]  Because how many other people are they doing this to, really?
[2115.94 --> 2116.88]  Yeah.
[2117.82 --> 2121.24]  That's the worst thing that I can think of at this point in time.
[2122.28 --> 2128.20]  I do find it entertaining that your positive point actually has absolutely nothing to do with computers or the purchasing of them.
[2130.58 --> 2130.98]  Yeah.
[2132.34 --> 2134.68]  I try to forget about the computer part.
[2134.68 --> 2135.68]  All right.
[2135.68 --> 2138.62]  All right.
[2138.84 --> 2139.66]  Oh, man.
[2139.76 --> 2141.48]  See, I don't know what to do with this.
[2141.60 --> 2157.20]  I just got an email from someone that claims to be from formerly a Dell phone sales rep that basically kind of confirms a lot of the assumptions that we've made about how they've structured their sales process.
[2157.20 --> 2161.34]  And apparently it's worse than I thought.
[2161.54 --> 2166.66]  Unfortunately, without us having any confirmation from this person, I don't want to talk about it.
[2166.66 --> 2173.98]  But what I will do is I'm going to reach out to this person asking for proof that they worked at Dell.
[2175.88 --> 2178.46]  And can you back up any of these claims?
[2179.00 --> 2188.48]  I just, ever since watching it, I've just been, been like having, having fun little daydreams about like the next follow-up video, like the duel with Dell.
[2188.48 --> 2188.80]  Yeah.
[2190.00 --> 2190.32]  Yeah.
[2190.32 --> 2192.16]  Like I just, I just want to see it go down.
[2192.32 --> 2197.40]  You know, I just, cause that was so, that like bothered me a lot.
[2197.54 --> 2198.08]  I think.
[2199.90 --> 2201.82]  Some of these accusations are pretty big.
[2202.96 --> 2207.46]  Some of these accusations in this, in this email are like pretty explosive.
[2207.46 --> 2210.24]  So I'll, let's see, let's see how that goes.
[2210.30 --> 2211.16]  Let's see how that goes.
[2211.16 --> 2219.78]  It would be not great for our business to like go to, go to war with Dell, but guys, I'll tell you what, if this turns out to be true, we're taking it public.
[2220.12 --> 2223.40]  And that's just the way it's going to be because we can't ignore that stuff.
[2223.92 --> 2224.36]  Yes.
[2224.60 --> 2225.20]  It's coming.
[2226.06 --> 2226.50]  Hopefully.
[2227.42 --> 2228.96]  I want it so bad.
[2229.10 --> 2231.30]  I've got just a couple more questions for Sarah.
[2231.68 --> 2236.72]  Olenik over on Flowplane asks, Sarah, what got you into graphic design and what makes you love it?
[2237.82 --> 2239.64]  Ooh, this is such a great question.
[2239.64 --> 2242.54]  I've thought about this in my head many, many times before.
[2243.22 --> 2245.86]  I'll do a little, a little life story really quick here.
[2246.34 --> 2249.92]  So in high school, I only took science and math courses.
[2249.92 --> 2250.22]  Really.
[2250.28 --> 2253.12]  I did physics, pre-cal chemistry, biology.
[2254.36 --> 2256.46]  And I enjoyed it.
[2256.46 --> 2263.28]  I wanted to go into university to study like biology stuff.
[2263.40 --> 2269.62]  I wanted to be a forensic pathologist, which is basically somebody who looks into dead bodies and trying to figure out the cause of death.
[2270.62 --> 2273.04]  But I wasn't that great at science.
[2273.04 --> 2277.12]  And I always loved doing art as a spare time activity.
[2277.32 --> 2279.68]  So when I was stressed, I'd just finish all my homework.
[2279.80 --> 2281.36]  I would be like, okay, I'm just going to draw.
[2281.58 --> 2282.52]  I'm just going to paint.
[2282.52 --> 2287.40]  And then my grandfather bought me a computer in like grade seven.
[2287.90 --> 2290.26]  It was a little MacBook Air, 11 inch.
[2290.48 --> 2292.54]  And I loved it.
[2292.58 --> 2295.50]  I used to play around with paint and stuff on there.
[2295.50 --> 2301.56]  So then going into university, I was like, I'm just going to follow my passion.
[2302.28 --> 2307.22]  Which I know there's like a meme that's like graphic design is a passion, but is my passion.
[2307.44 --> 2308.44]  But it really is.
[2308.44 --> 2314.40]  As soon as I started, I realized that I loved combining art and technology.
[2314.80 --> 2317.10]  And that is essentially what graphic design is.
[2318.18 --> 2327.40]  And in my first semester, I did this project and submitted it to a worldwide contest and ended up winning like one of the awards.
[2327.72 --> 2328.14]  Oh, cool.
[2328.14 --> 2332.12]  So then I just figured out that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
[2332.24 --> 2334.10]  I finished my diploma and now I'm here.
[2334.36 --> 2335.64]  So I guess it was meant to be.
[2336.00 --> 2336.26]  Yeah.
[2336.30 --> 2338.64]  We're your first job like out of school, aren't we?
[2340.06 --> 2340.50]  Yeah.
[2340.62 --> 2341.34]  Well, okay.
[2341.36 --> 2350.40]  I worked at a design agency in Vancouver for like three months, just doing freelance stuff, designing for developments.
[2350.40 --> 2354.80]  So like doing naming for developments and branding for developments.
[2354.92 --> 2355.30]  Cool.
[2355.34 --> 2356.48]  But it was really boring.
[2356.48 --> 2360.16]  Yeah, that would be pretty boring compared to like illustrating a children's book.
[2360.28 --> 2362.60]  By the way, this is great.
[2362.80 --> 2367.70]  Paul Gerrard actually just pointed out something that frankly, I did not notice.
[2368.42 --> 2370.30]  This is a super chat over on YouTube.
[2370.48 --> 2379.18]  Are you aware that Dell sold you the in-home service package and tried to get you to RMA the product to the depot yourself instead of suggesting to send someone?
[2379.26 --> 2380.50]  I did not notice.
[2380.90 --> 2382.70]  That was pointed out in the comments, actually.
[2382.98 --> 2383.30]  But yeah.
[2383.48 --> 2384.62]  That's hilarious.
[2384.62 --> 2387.04]  They are so bad.
[2387.42 --> 2388.84]  Like they're so bad.
[2389.92 --> 2390.84]  That's brutal.
[2391.24 --> 2391.74]  Dumb and villainy.
[2392.44 --> 2393.46]  That hurts.
[2393.86 --> 2394.66]  That honestly hurts.
[2395.74 --> 2396.52]  The worst.
[2397.10 --> 2397.86]  All right.
[2398.08 --> 2398.68]  One more.
[2398.94 --> 2399.44]  One more.
[2399.92 --> 2404.12]  Jason by three says, great job with the ABC book.
[2404.32 --> 2405.88]  Me and my girlfriend love it.
[2406.60 --> 2407.60]  It's not really a question.
[2407.60 --> 2408.46]  Thank you so much.
[2408.54 --> 2409.46]  Not really a question.
[2410.28 --> 2412.08]  And I lied.
[2412.22 --> 2417.02]  There is one more thing that I wanted to talk about on the show before you go away.
[2418.14 --> 2418.50]  Yep.
[2419.00 --> 2420.96]  I think I have a feeling I know.
[2421.08 --> 2425.84]  New merch at LTTstore.com designed by the one and only Ms. Butt.
[2426.50 --> 2427.34]  Oh, yeah.
[2427.34 --> 2429.60]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have toques.
[2431.18 --> 2431.62]  Yep.
[2432.32 --> 2432.56]  Okay.
[2432.60 --> 2433.34]  What color do you got?
[2433.42 --> 2434.22]  Luke, do you have one?
[2434.46 --> 2434.96]  Over the headphones.
[2435.16 --> 2435.90]  I do not have one.
[2436.02 --> 2437.22]  You do not have one?
[2437.50 --> 2438.00]  All right.
[2438.08 --> 2439.10]  Well, that's fine.
[2439.20 --> 2440.28]  I will just have to model.
[2440.42 --> 2440.70]  I have three.
[2440.86 --> 2441.48]  You have three.
[2441.48 --> 2441.64]  Nice.
[2441.64 --> 2442.64]  I also have three.
[2442.96 --> 2444.48]  Okay, Sarah, what color are you going to wear?
[2444.54 --> 2445.60]  And then I'll show the other two.
[2445.68 --> 2446.90]  And we'll see which ones sell better.
[2447.06 --> 2447.22]  This one matches.
[2447.86 --> 2448.18]  All right.
[2448.18 --> 2449.02]  So you're going with that one?
[2449.68 --> 2450.22]  Rock on.
[2450.22 --> 2452.66]  Well, then I didn't need to open that.
[2453.22 --> 2453.94]  Oh, wait.
[2453.96 --> 2454.90]  You're wearing them over the headphones?
[2455.32 --> 2455.72]  Okay.
[2455.98 --> 2457.22]  Can you just relax?
[2457.60 --> 2458.54]  It looks kind of cool.
[2458.54 --> 2462.34]  Just relax, kids today, and you're mean.
[2462.68 --> 2468.14]  Bad enough, I see people wearing, like, toques, and then they've got headphones over top of them.
[2468.76 --> 2471.90]  Anyway, the point is, we have toques.
[2472.08 --> 2475.84]  That's what we call what you Yankee Doodles call beanies.
[2476.40 --> 2477.32]  And they're LTT.
[2477.52 --> 2478.42]  Really subtle branding.
[2478.56 --> 2479.42]  They've just got these.
[2480.00 --> 2480.28]  Oh, yeah.
[2480.30 --> 2481.04]  You can kind of see it.
[2481.06 --> 2481.98]  It catches the light there.
[2482.36 --> 2486.00]  They've just got a little LTT on the little leather or fabric.
[2486.58 --> 2487.50]  What's this called, Sarah?
[2487.50 --> 2489.00]  Is there a technical term for that thing?
[2489.80 --> 2491.18]  It's called a hem tag.
[2491.42 --> 2492.24]  A hem tag.
[2492.34 --> 2493.04]  Thank you for that.
[2493.22 --> 2493.44]  Yep.
[2493.56 --> 2494.14]  Very helpful.
[2494.70 --> 2500.18]  So they've got a little logo on the hem tag, and we've got three different colors.
[2500.44 --> 2503.46]  So we've got the black on almost black.
[2503.46 --> 2505.08]  So I think we're calling that stealth.
[2505.20 --> 2505.68]  Is that right?
[2506.70 --> 2507.32]  I think so, yeah.
[2507.40 --> 2508.86]  What are the other two colors called, Sarah?
[2510.06 --> 2513.06]  This one's called dark heather aqua, I believe.
[2513.94 --> 2515.46]  And then this one is just light gray.
[2515.46 --> 2518.22]  But it has the orange hem tag, which is super cute.
[2518.50 --> 2522.82]  This is the one I'm going with for today, just because it kind of matches my shirt.
[2522.90 --> 2524.26]  So I got the Constellation shirt.
[2524.38 --> 2525.32]  I got the aqua.
[2525.76 --> 2530.94]  I really wish I had an actual mirror right now, because this is really hard to do in a
[2530.94 --> 2534.84]  not properly looking at my camera feed.
[2536.36 --> 2537.18]  Everything's opposite.
[2538.00 --> 2538.40]  All right.
[2538.44 --> 2539.48]  We're going to call that good enough.
[2539.86 --> 2542.80]  So I've got my one that matches my Constellation shirt here.
[2543.40 --> 2545.94]  And Sarah is just straight up memeing it up.
[2546.28 --> 2547.90]  So thank you for that, Sarah.
[2548.58 --> 2550.68]  LTTstore.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[2550.98 --> 2552.34]  How much are we charging for these?
[2553.24 --> 2554.92]  I believe they're $19.99.
[2554.92 --> 2555.18]  I don't remember.
[2555.84 --> 2556.44]  $19.99.
[2556.74 --> 2557.98]  The LTT beanie.
[2558.50 --> 2560.04]  So let's go ahead and get the...
[2560.04 --> 2560.42]  Oh, wow.
[2560.52 --> 2561.14]  This is...
[2561.14 --> 2561.62]  Oh, boy.
[2562.00 --> 2562.88]  This is bad.
[2563.06 --> 2563.74]  Hold on a second.
[2563.90 --> 2564.48]  I need to...
[2564.48 --> 2565.28]  There we go.
[2565.54 --> 2566.26]  Look at this guy.
[2566.38 --> 2567.50]  Look at this face he's making.
[2567.62 --> 2569.12]  I actually took that picture today.
[2569.68 --> 2571.72]  So that's exactly what I look like.
[2571.90 --> 2572.88]  I love this one.
[2572.96 --> 2573.30]  I love...
[2573.30 --> 2576.38]  How did you decide on the different hem tag designs?
[2577.24 --> 2578.16]  Like, they're all different.
[2578.16 --> 2579.80]  I don't know.
[2579.94 --> 2581.82]  Just designer instinct, I guess.
[2581.86 --> 2584.16]  And then a lot of back and forth with Linus and Nick.
[2585.26 --> 2585.76]  Oh, that's right.
[2585.82 --> 2586.54]  I was involved in that.
[2588.58 --> 2591.16]  Just trying to decide what we thought would be best.
[2591.24 --> 2595.38]  We wanted to have, like, a few really different options.
[2595.50 --> 2596.28]  Did you just say be best?
[2596.28 --> 2597.24]  Are you anti-bullying?
[2597.38 --> 2597.54]  Sorry.
[2597.62 --> 2597.84]  Go ahead.
[2597.90 --> 2598.14]  Go ahead.
[2598.34 --> 2599.46]  No, that's not funny.
[2599.60 --> 2600.20]  I'll save it.
[2602.04 --> 2604.02]  So, like, for this one, it's colored.
[2604.28 --> 2606.48]  And then this one is, like, a black leather.
[2606.76 --> 2608.82]  And this one is a brown leather.
[2609.10 --> 2609.60]  So, like, yeah.
[2609.60 --> 2610.98]  It's just a few different options.
[2611.08 --> 2613.32]  And then for colors, we wanted to have kind of a fun color.
[2613.70 --> 2613.88]  Yeah.
[2613.92 --> 2615.36]  But it goes with everything.
[2615.72 --> 2617.28]  Like, Nick wears this beanie every day.
[2617.62 --> 2619.16]  Jono started wearing it every day.
[2619.52 --> 2620.20]  It looks great.
[2620.28 --> 2620.92]  I'm not going to lie.
[2621.00 --> 2621.98]  Like, it's a good color.
[2622.56 --> 2628.64]  And then this one for, like, the people who don't want to show off their love for LTT.
[2628.64 --> 2629.80]  This one is more stealthy.
[2629.80 --> 2631.30]  They just want to quietly love LTT.
[2632.00 --> 2632.94]  Yeah, exactly.
[2632.94 --> 2637.64]  And then this one is just, like, the average beanie, I would say.
[2638.86 --> 2639.64]  All right.
[2639.98 --> 2643.28]  Well, thank you very much for coming on the show today.
[2643.38 --> 2646.90]  I am so sorry that you ended up stuck at work late.
[2647.78 --> 2648.38]  That's okay.
[2648.56 --> 2649.02]  All right.
[2649.18 --> 2649.50]  Yeah.
[2649.82 --> 2653.20]  Anyway, thanks, everyone, for sending in such great questions for Sarah.
[2653.36 --> 2656.98]  We will now resume your regular WAN show programming.
[2657.22 --> 2658.88]  See you on Monday, Sarah.
[2659.58 --> 2660.24]  Sounds good.
[2660.30 --> 2660.58]  Bye, guys.
[2660.58 --> 2661.22]  Have a great weekend.
[2661.58 --> 2661.88]  Bye.
[2662.06 --> 2662.34]  You too.
[2662.94 --> 2665.26]  And I think we need to do sponsors.
[2665.46 --> 2665.50]  All right.
[2665.50 --> 2666.04]  There we go.
[2666.18 --> 2668.78]  Actually, we need to do one more LTT store thing.
[2669.52 --> 2669.96]  Oh, my.
[2670.10 --> 2673.70]  This is a product that I am extremely excited about.
[2675.32 --> 2676.18]  Look at this.
[2676.36 --> 2679.00]  Is this not the cutest thing you ever saw?
[2681.24 --> 2683.10]  It's a little CPU pillow.
[2683.10 --> 2683.66]  Oh, look at that.
[2683.66 --> 2685.88]  Oh, look at that.
[2685.88 --> 2687.86]  It's got little pins on the bottom and everything.
[2688.94 --> 2690.48]  So, okay.
[2690.66 --> 2697.38]  This is one of those situations where I probably should have been a little bit more flexible.
[2697.38 --> 2698.38]  These are really expensive.
[2698.38 --> 2699.84]  These are really expensive.
[2699.84 --> 2711.30]  And the reason is that instead of going with the super cheap synthetic fill that everyone uses in these products because it's super cheap.
[2711.30 --> 2723.26]  I had recently bought an alpaca wool duvet for one of my kids because it was on sale and it was exactly the same price as the regular cotton one.
[2723.26 --> 2724.36]  I was like, oh, alpacas.
[2724.48 --> 2725.02]  They're pretty cool.
[2725.02 --> 2730.22]  So, I bought it and I was like, oh, my God, this stuff is amazing.
[2731.12 --> 2733.36]  So, then we got the first samples.
[2733.74 --> 2738.06]  This is like many moons ago that we got the first samples of these CPU pillows.
[2738.90 --> 2742.84]  And I was just like, oh, these feel crappy.
[2743.16 --> 2744.96]  What if we could get one full of alpaca wool?
[2745.14 --> 2746.58]  I want an alpaca wool one.
[2746.82 --> 2750.28]  So, we got one and it was so nice.
[2750.52 --> 2754.08]  It was so squishy and just felt like so quality.
[2754.08 --> 2758.14]  But the small one was going to retail for like $40.
[2759.18 --> 2759.60]  Whoa.
[2760.14 --> 2760.48]  Okay.
[2760.76 --> 2764.12]  Because it was so expensive or like $34.99 or something like that.
[2764.42 --> 2770.28]  So, I settled on 40% alpaca wool and 60% polyester.
[2770.60 --> 2779.14]  And it ends up feeling like really good, like way better than if it was just polyester, but saving a lot of price compared to the alpaca wool one.
[2779.14 --> 2782.38]  So, then now let's get into the real problem with the alpaca wool.
[2782.46 --> 2788.74]  Because we probably could have done like a $40 little thing just because like we could have been like, oh, yeah, it's a merch item.
[2789.00 --> 2790.24]  You know, support us, whatever.
[2790.44 --> 2791.82]  We know the pricing makes no sense.
[2792.28 --> 2795.06]  Instead, it is $19.99 for this one.
[2795.06 --> 2798.68]  We probably could have gotten away with that.
[2799.08 --> 2808.48]  The big problem is that the big one would have cost over $100 at retail if we had done it with alpaca wool.
[2808.58 --> 2814.46]  I think it would have been like $129.99 based on like our target margin.
[2814.46 --> 2819.66]  But this one is more like a couch sized slash bed size one.
[2819.86 --> 2826.54]  And the other thing here is that this is the one that really benefits from the better wool more than the other one.
[2826.54 --> 2830.96]  Because instead of just being purely decorative, like it also looks cool.
[2831.36 --> 2831.84]  Check out.
[2831.98 --> 2832.46]  Check this out.
[2832.58 --> 2834.92]  Lloyd did a great job of the attention to detail on this.
[2835.30 --> 2836.58]  It's even got the little triangle.
[2836.74 --> 2837.94]  Yeah, it's got the little triangle.
[2838.20 --> 2838.90]  I was looking for it.
[2839.18 --> 2839.32]  Yeah.
[2839.66 --> 2842.00]  As you were spinning it around, I was like, where's the triangle?
[2842.00 --> 2849.86]  So this one, instead of just being decorative and looking cool, it is actually comfortable enough to lay your head on.
[2849.86 --> 2856.22]  And that was one of the big reasons that I insisted on us going with the blended fill for this one as well.
[2856.64 --> 2861.80]  Do you have any concerns with bias claims with these pillows?
[2862.58 --> 2863.28]  Bias claims?
[2863.38 --> 2864.14]  No, not really.
[2864.52 --> 2866.84]  Because I didn't even pick which CPU we were using.
[2867.00 --> 2871.72]  Lloyd just grabbed a CPU that was in the pile of like dead CPUs and chose that as a model.
[2872.00 --> 2875.82]  What we will probably do is an AMD one in the future.
[2876.02 --> 2885.52]  But the reason that after I saw the initial design, I didn't ask to change it was that this one to an average person, I think is more recognizable as a CPU.
[2885.80 --> 2890.38]  Whereas with AMD, we'd have to find some way to represent pins instead of pads.
[2890.60 --> 2893.92]  So it was a bit more challenging artwork wise.
[2894.52 --> 2894.86]  And Intel...
[2894.86 --> 2896.02]  It was on a shag carpet.
[2896.02 --> 2897.94]  Yeah, ew.
[2898.28 --> 2900.68]  And Intel also has a larger green border.
[2901.10 --> 2909.30]  So from the top, like it looks more CPU like, whereas the AMD one would be like this super narrow band and like the proportions wouldn't be kind of as fun.
[2909.72 --> 2912.90]  So it was less of like an Intel versus AMD thing.
[2912.90 --> 2914.94]  You know, this is clearly an Intel CPU.
[2914.94 --> 2919.08]  And it was more of just like, you know, what kind of looks cuter.
[2919.64 --> 2924.72]  We've already got people in float plane chat being like, do a limited run of 100% alpaca wool.
[2925.04 --> 2925.22]  Okay.
[2925.54 --> 2925.80]  Okay.
[2926.26 --> 2928.88]  That if these sell well, I want to do it.
[2928.94 --> 2931.30]  I want to do like the CPU pillow extreme edition.
[2933.36 --> 2935.86]  But there's no guarantee that we're going to do that.
[2935.86 --> 2936.08]  That's so perfect.
[2936.44 --> 2937.26]  I know, right?
[2937.26 --> 2941.04]  And then I wanted to do like, I wanted to do a black, black PCB.
[2941.64 --> 2942.08]  Yeah.
[2942.80 --> 2946.70]  And so like black on black and gold on the bottom, like do extreme edition CPU.
[2946.92 --> 2949.70]  We also sampled different colors at the top.
[2949.82 --> 2953.02]  So there's a darker gray that I think could work really well with that one.
[2953.10 --> 2954.94]  So I'm not saying it will happen.
[2955.32 --> 2957.96]  But I'm also not saying that it won't happen.
[2959.32 --> 2960.80]  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
[2961.10 --> 2962.78]  People like holy cow $70 pillow.
[2962.78 --> 2966.40]  Okay, like for real though, go shop at like Pottery Barn or whatever.
[2966.40 --> 2967.80]  And it's not going to look that bad.
[2967.92 --> 2973.70]  And the difference is that these are 40% alpaca wool instead of just being like full of garbage.
[2973.94 --> 2977.22]  So it really does add a lot of cost.
[2978.60 --> 2979.08]  Yeah.
[2980.40 --> 2982.06]  Oh, we should totally do.
[2982.90 --> 2984.46]  This is a great idea.
[2985.04 --> 2985.56]  Dogfish.
[2985.66 --> 2986.02]  Good case.
[2986.06 --> 2987.20]  There's lots of people talking about it.
[2987.22 --> 2989.08]  We should do a thread ripper one.
[2989.24 --> 2990.32]  That's like a pillow.
[2990.88 --> 2992.92]  It would be so expensive though.
[2993.18 --> 2994.92]  We could do like a pillow case.
[2994.92 --> 2996.94]  Thread ripper pillow case.
[2997.14 --> 2998.72]  Okay, I'm going to send that to Nick right now.
[3002.32 --> 3004.44]  This is maybe low hanging fruit.
[3004.58 --> 3004.76]  Yeah.
[3005.44 --> 3009.00]  Given certain things that have been in the news recently.
[3010.44 --> 3017.92]  But as someone who is completely detached, and I have no idea what goes on in the designing and pricing of these products.
[3017.92 --> 3022.36]  It might just cost more if you don't use slave labor.
[3023.54 --> 3026.00]  Well, yeah, that's definitely a factor.
[3027.14 --> 3030.00]  That's why we haven't had underwear for like six months.
[3031.10 --> 3032.50]  Well, no, I mean, I have underwear.
[3032.64 --> 3033.72]  Like I'm wearing underwear right now.
[3033.72 --> 3034.72]  That makes sense.
[3034.76 --> 3038.86]  Because I actually wanted to buy a three pack recently and couldn't and was like, what the heck?
[3038.86 --> 3039.34]  Yeah.
[3039.34 --> 3039.66]  Yeah.
[3039.84 --> 3045.48]  So to make up for them being out of stock for so long, we have a better supplier now that we're happy with.
[3045.58 --> 3046.56]  They're factory conditions.
[3047.08 --> 3050.02]  The order is in, I believe it's actually in production.
[3050.82 --> 3059.28]  And what we're doing to kind of make up for that we didn't have the V1 underwear for so long is we're going to do our V2 underwear.
[3059.28 --> 3060.24]  We're going to launch that.
[3060.36 --> 3066.94]  And we are also going to do like our rerun, a reprint of the V1 designs with the V2 waistband.
[3067.20 --> 3071.12]  So if you really liked the V1 designs, you will have a chance to get those.
[3071.18 --> 3073.52]  I think it's going to be shortly after we launch the V2s.
[3074.22 --> 3074.32]  Cool.
[3074.96 --> 3076.08]  Oh, man.
[3076.58 --> 3077.18]  Oh, man.
[3077.26 --> 3077.66]  Love it.
[3077.78 --> 3083.38]  Love launching new merch stuff because it's like so fun, especially when it's like just especially when.
[3083.50 --> 3084.18]  OK, a couple of things.
[3084.18 --> 3088.72]  One, we managed to hit the cold season with a like cold weather product for a change.
[3088.72 --> 3095.72]  Usually our stuff gets delayed so much that we like miss the correct season for it by the time it's ready to ship.
[3095.96 --> 3100.98]  And then two, these CPU pillows, these have been in the works for almost a year.
[3101.20 --> 3104.32]  Like, oh, man, we have some crazy samples.
[3104.48 --> 3107.62]  We got this one that's like the size of a dog bed at one point.
[3107.66 --> 3109.44]  I was like, how are we going to ship this?
[3109.92 --> 3111.58]  But it's super cool.
[3112.02 --> 3118.00]  Man, we've been working on it forever to get the feel just right, get the cost somewhat sensible.
[3118.00 --> 3119.06]  I know they're expensive.
[3119.96 --> 3120.84]  Anyway, yeah.
[3121.42 --> 3124.72]  Someone in float plane chat said, oh, no, they said who would.
[3125.96 --> 3128.14]  But I think they're including themselves in this.
[3128.24 --> 3129.34]  Like who else kind of.
[3129.60 --> 3132.42]  But they're saying who would buy a $200 GPU body pillow?
[3133.50 --> 3134.46]  Oh, man.
[3136.20 --> 3139.14]  OK, let's cross that bridge when we get to it.
[3139.14 --> 3141.58]  Because if it was body pillow size.
[3141.88 --> 3142.68]  Motherboard blankets.
[3143.52 --> 3146.46]  That might be like $250, like $300.
[3147.18 --> 3148.24]  Also, I already.
[3148.36 --> 3149.66]  You guys could do a duvet cover.
[3150.04 --> 3151.58]  I already have a mock up for that.
[3152.32 --> 3152.72]  Beautiful.
[3153.04 --> 3153.78]  I already have it.
[3153.78 --> 3154.30]  It's not motherboard.
[3154.46 --> 3154.86]  It's GPU.
[3155.42 --> 3158.30]  But Lloyd has a design for it.
[3158.38 --> 3158.98]  Don't worry about it.
[3159.00 --> 3159.40]  We're on it.
[3159.48 --> 3159.92]  We're on it.
[3159.92 --> 3163.26]  But like, honestly, guys, body pillow size, that could be like $300.
[3163.88 --> 3171.56]  Like, honestly, maybe $250 if we were like, OK, we're going to eat it on some of the margin here because you guys like said you really wanted it.
[3171.62 --> 3173.46]  But like, that's ridiculous.
[3173.84 --> 3174.70]  I don't think.
[3174.78 --> 3175.28]  I don't think.
[3175.54 --> 3175.74]  Yeah.
[3175.74 --> 3177.62]  Yeah, I don't think so, guys.
[3178.30 --> 3180.50]  Silver X says, please relaunch Constellation's shirt.
[3180.60 --> 3181.48]  We are working on it.
[3181.50 --> 3182.28]  We have a new hire.
[3182.64 --> 3183.74]  She started a week ago.
[3184.10 --> 3189.44]  She like actually knows things about like pattern making and fashion design and stuff.
[3189.52 --> 3190.60]  I'm super excited.
[3191.08 --> 3196.74]  We got her from a Canadian like men's fashion retailer that relocated their head office.
[3197.32 --> 3201.02]  And, you know, it's not that she wasn't like great at her job or whatever.
[3201.38 --> 3202.38]  Her references were great.
[3202.38 --> 3204.98]  She just like didn't want to move to somewhere crappy.
[3205.78 --> 3207.76]  And so we snagged her.
[3207.88 --> 3208.76]  I'm super excited.
[3209.10 --> 3212.22]  She's still on her probation, so I can't tell you like much more about her.
[3212.26 --> 3214.64]  But I promise you'll meet her eventually.
[3214.64 --> 3217.22]  You're going to see some great products out of her.
[3217.60 --> 3218.38]  Super excited.
[3219.06 --> 3220.56]  We should talk about some tech news.
[3220.90 --> 3221.28]  What do you think?
[3221.40 --> 3223.44]  We should we should do ad spots.
[3223.66 --> 3224.90]  Oh, yes.
[3225.34 --> 3227.52]  The show today is sponsored by Redux.
[3227.52 --> 3228.52]  Redux.
[3228.52 --> 3235.18]  Redux.com is where you can get a system at retail pricing plus just a $75 build fee.
[3235.72 --> 3242.84]  Redux is trying to bring PC gaming to the masses and all builds come with a two year warranty without a predatory upsell.
[3242.84 --> 3248.28]  You just select your budget, pick your game, see how they perform, and then let them build your PC.
[3249.90 --> 3250.64]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3250.82 --> 3252.18]  They don't cut corners on quality.
[3252.38 --> 3255.28]  And you can start your build today at buildredux.com slash Linus.
[3255.46 --> 3259.28]  If you're not sure whether you should trust some random brand new PC builder.
[3260.30 --> 3260.90]  Digital Storm.
[3261.76 --> 3263.42]  Yeah, they're like sort of not.
[3264.92 --> 3265.36]  Yeah.
[3265.36 --> 3267.70]  So they're not that new.
[3268.36 --> 3268.56]  Kite.
[3269.40 --> 3276.14]  Kite is a plugin that adds AI powered code completions to your code editor or IDE, allowing programmers to code smarter and faster.
[3276.24 --> 3276.78]  Have you used Kite?
[3277.30 --> 3277.82]  Do you know about this?
[3277.82 --> 3278.30]  You're nodding.
[3278.48 --> 3278.82]  Oh, okay.
[3279.32 --> 3279.90]  They use machine learning.
[3279.90 --> 3280.46]  I've heard of them.
[3280.52 --> 3280.98]  I've heard of them.
[3281.06 --> 3281.70]  I have not used it.
[3281.82 --> 3287.02]  To power their completions experience, allowing less memory, CPU, and battery usage on your computer.
[3287.34 --> 3290.60]  This allows for longer, more relevant, and less noisy complications.
[3291.50 --> 3295.58]  Kite's completions are sorted or ranked by relevance instead of popularity or the alphabet.
[3296.08 --> 3300.90]  And they offer support for 16 programming languages, including Java, HTML, Kotlin.
[3301.18 --> 3301.62]  Help me out.
[3302.72 --> 3303.02]  Nope.
[3303.40 --> 3303.96]  You're going to struggle.
[3304.30 --> 3304.88]  And Ruby.
[3305.14 --> 3307.84]  And seamlessly integrate with supported IDs already installed in your computer.
[3307.90 --> 3308.48]  It's one of those things.
[3308.60 --> 3309.92]  I've never, I've seen it written.
[3310.02 --> 3311.48]  I've never heard it said out loud.
[3311.56 --> 3312.16]  I'm so sorry.
[3312.50 --> 3314.04]  Best of all, Kite is free to use.
[3314.04 --> 3317.02]  So download it today at the link in the video description.
[3317.82 --> 3320.16]  Finally in the show is brought to you by Vessi Footwear.
[3320.60 --> 3325.26]  Vessi Footwear is known for making comfortable shoes that are light and, most importantly, water-resistant.
[3325.54 --> 3328.14]  You can walk in almost any terrain while keeping your feet dry.
[3328.24 --> 3333.50]  You can even have a water gun fight in the winter with your Vessi Footwear.
[3333.60 --> 3334.66]  And it'll keep your feet dry.
[3334.78 --> 3335.88]  I speak from experience.
[3336.02 --> 3337.74]  Go check out that video on Channel Super Fun.
[3338.34 --> 3339.76]  They've got their new weekend shoe.
[3339.84 --> 3341.18]  Okay, this has been my talking points forever.
[3341.28 --> 3342.28]  They have the weekend shoe.
[3342.28 --> 3346.90]  And they have a look that fits almost all occasions for men and women.
[3347.14 --> 3353.04]  You can get $25 off each pair with offer code WANSHOW at Vessi.com slash WANSHOW.
[3354.04 --> 3354.88]  All right, Luke.
[3355.00 --> 3356.40]  Let's do some tech news.
[3356.82 --> 3357.78]  What do you want to talk about first?
[3358.78 --> 3363.50]  What was the, I can't remember the last, there was some programming language in the hiring
[3363.50 --> 3365.74]  video that you said that everyone freaked out about as well.
[3365.74 --> 3366.68]  I don't want to talk about it.
[3368.38 --> 3371.14]  I think we should talk about 3060 Ti.
[3371.48 --> 3372.22]  3060 Ti?
[3372.72 --> 3375.58]  I don't think there's a lot of notes here.
[3375.70 --> 3378.02]  I don't necessarily think we need to go like all the way through it.
[3378.12 --> 3383.16]  But the RTX 3060 Ti launched and it's gone.
[3383.80 --> 3385.20]  Yeah, it's gone already.
[3385.92 --> 3387.26]  You know what's crazy?
[3387.38 --> 3391.36]  Like we speculated in our review that the timing of the launch along with the pricing
[3391.36 --> 3394.90]  suggests that NVIDIA is targeting would-be console buyers.
[3394.90 --> 3400.28]  And it seems like NVIDIA really played, other than not being able to make enough cards to
[3400.28 --> 3405.66]  fill the demand, NVIDIA really played their cards right, going aggressively after this
[3405.66 --> 3411.36]  launch window that slightly preceded the console launch with their high-priced products so that
[3411.36 --> 3414.92]  they could get as much revenue as possible out of the people that wanted next-gen and
[3414.92 --> 3415.86]  had the coin to spend.
[3416.40 --> 3422.12]  And then followed up with like this kind of this one, two, three, like, you know, punch-punch,
[3422.12 --> 3429.54]  uppercut combo with a $400 product that happens to be just exactly what a next-gen console costs
[3429.54 --> 3435.16]  that's shipping right as you cannot buy a next-gen console in time for the holidays.
[3435.70 --> 3440.18]  I mean, I saw a lot of people criticize us for pointing out that a PlayStation 5 and an
[3440.18 --> 3444.60]  RTX 3060 Ti are the same price, saying, well, what about the rest of the computer?
[3445.16 --> 3446.88]  You got to remember who our audience is, guys.
[3446.88 --> 3449.12]  Like, we're talking to computer enthusiasts.
[3449.12 --> 3454.00]  I think it's a fair assumption that they own something that's like, I mean, what,
[3454.10 --> 3456.50]  Sandy Bridge at worst, probably?
[3457.22 --> 3462.76]  And you could pair like a 2600K or a 3770K, like an Ivy Bridge processor, you could pair
[3462.76 --> 3464.54]  that with a 3060 Ti.
[3465.04 --> 3466.88]  It'd be a little bottlenecked or whatever.
[3467.16 --> 3470.22]  But that's how a lot of people upgrade their systems, piecemeal.
[3470.22 --> 3475.40]  You do the GPU now, and then a couple years down the road, you go and you do like a CPU
[3475.40 --> 3477.56]  motherboard upgrade or whatever the case may be.
[3477.90 --> 3480.66]  My girlfriend is running a 2600K and a 1080.
[3481.66 --> 3483.68]  Yeah, that's because you don't love her very much.
[3483.76 --> 3484.86]  I know, I know, I get it.
[3484.86 --> 3485.68]  I get it.
[3486.04 --> 3491.28]  My wife's running a 3770K, so not much better.
[3491.28 --> 3497.88]  I don't even think she has like an 80 series card, and it's older than that.
[3497.96 --> 3502.48]  I think it's like, I think it's 900 family, like a 970 or something.
[3502.86 --> 3505.54]  So yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a self burn.
[3505.72 --> 3507.60]  That's a self burn right there.
[3509.68 --> 3515.74]  The craziest thing about this is that I wasn't even willing to give NVIDIA the benefit of the
[3515.74 --> 3515.92]  doubt.
[3515.92 --> 3520.64]  We scripted our video before we had any indication that there would be shortages of the 3060 Ti,
[3520.64 --> 3526.22]  and we pretty much, we reported proactively that there would be shortages of the 3060 Ti.
[3526.50 --> 3527.36]  Very irresponsible.
[3528.14 --> 3533.08]  This goes back to a conversation we've had multiple times and a long time ago about how
[3533.08 --> 3537.30]  like you could probably make review videos for graphics cards before the graphics cards
[3537.30 --> 3537.74]  come out.
[3538.22 --> 3543.22]  But this is now like you could probably do graphics card news before the graphics card
[3543.22 --> 3544.34]  news comes out.
[3544.62 --> 3546.32]  It's like we're moving forward.
[3546.48 --> 3547.98]  We totally pulled it off, man.
[3548.12 --> 3549.18]  We totally pulled it off.
[3549.30 --> 3550.48]  We got away with one there.
[3550.64 --> 3552.70]  We would have looked so stupid.
[3554.00 --> 3555.52]  Anyway, we pulled it off.
[3556.24 --> 3561.40]  And I was actually really worried because in the day before the launch, a news started
[3561.40 --> 3566.10]  coming out of retailers saying, well, actually, you know, we're feeling kind of bullish on
[3566.10 --> 3572.36]  this because we've got more supply of 3060 Ti than every other 30 series card combined up
[3572.36 --> 3573.08]  until this point.
[3573.08 --> 3577.44]  And I was like, oh, OK, let's see how this goes.
[3578.04 --> 3583.62]  But no, it's while it seems like more gamers were able to get their hands on these than the
[3583.62 --> 3584.74]  other recent GPU launches.
[3584.98 --> 3586.66]  There were not enough to go around.
[3586.80 --> 3591.44]  And as usual, a big part of the problem is, of course, scalpers.
[3591.44 --> 3591.80]  Scalpers.
[3592.52 --> 3592.92]  Scalpers.
[3592.92 --> 3593.38]  Scalpers, yes.
[3594.00 --> 3595.32]  You know what's really funny?
[3595.42 --> 3597.76]  I had someone blaming me for scalpers the other day.
[3598.20 --> 3603.00]  Like if like if influencers didn't review products and say that they were good, that
[3603.00 --> 3605.98]  people wouldn't know they were good and want them.
[3606.08 --> 3608.28]  There's still like launch events and stuff.
[3608.50 --> 3608.72]  Like what?
[3608.88 --> 3610.44]  Like somehow this is my fault.
[3610.48 --> 3610.72]  So what?
[3610.72 --> 3611.30]  I should lie.
[3611.42 --> 3615.38]  I should say it's bad so that you can get one because no one else will be in on the
[3615.38 --> 3615.68]  secret.
[3616.42 --> 3621.62]  If people didn't know products were coming out, they wouldn't have to rush to buy them.
[3621.80 --> 3623.10]  They'd have no idea.
[3623.36 --> 3624.28]  OK, sure.
[3624.54 --> 3625.20]  Yeah, exactly.
[3625.94 --> 3630.14]  So anyway, yeah, it looks like that whole thing is definitely happening.
[3630.14 --> 3634.14]  They're going for anywhere from 600 to 750 bucks.
[3634.82 --> 3638.08]  This card is I mean, it's a great looking card.
[3638.08 --> 3642.10]  Um, you shouldn't be paying that kind of money for it.
[3642.16 --> 3645.42]  Just please wait, guys, please.
[3645.78 --> 3647.78]  OK, wow.
[3647.88 --> 3649.40]  Here's one that went for MSRP.
[3649.70 --> 3650.62]  That's pretty sick.
[3651.38 --> 3652.54]  Wait, who sold this?
[3654.10 --> 3655.46]  OK, Glack 13.
[3655.78 --> 3655.96]  Wow.
[3656.02 --> 3660.82]  What a what a bro, you know, what a bro or sis, you know, all good.
[3661.54 --> 3662.74]  Is this Glack again?
[3664.36 --> 3665.54]  What are you what are you talking about?
[3665.56 --> 3666.12]  What's up, Glack?
[3666.36 --> 3667.58]  Sorry, I'm screen sharing right now.
[3667.58 --> 3672.12]  I'm showing there's there's a seller that's selling 3060 TIs for MSRP.
[3673.50 --> 3674.58]  OK, hold on a second.
[3674.78 --> 3675.74]  Who's this Glack?
[3676.32 --> 3677.54]  Is this just a store?
[3677.84 --> 3678.78]  Oh, you know what?
[3679.16 --> 3681.18]  I wonder if it's like a picture of it or whatever.
[3681.52 --> 3683.18]  I wonder if this is just a scammer.
[3683.18 --> 3686.26]  Oh, because they've only got two feedback.
[3687.36 --> 3688.14]  I don't know.
[3688.40 --> 3689.30]  I don't know.
[3690.08 --> 3690.64]  I don't know.
[3690.76 --> 3695.34]  OK, to be clear, I'm not recommending you go buy a 3060 TI from Glack over there.
[3695.34 --> 3699.48]  Yeah, that did not happen on the show today.
[3700.22 --> 3703.80]  I was like wondering if it was from like offshoot of Galax or something.
[3704.10 --> 3706.08]  The good news is like eBay store.
[3706.08 --> 3711.90]  The good news is that rumors of an AMD answer to the new card in January are starting to swirl.
[3712.08 --> 3715.22]  So we might get an RX 6700 XT.
[3715.78 --> 3717.94]  Which will also be immediately sold out.
[3718.00 --> 3719.56]  Which will probably also be immediately sold out.
[3719.62 --> 3723.50]  I mean, if I'm AMD, like I can only get so much seven nanometer anything.
[3723.50 --> 3725.24]  I don't know.
[3725.34 --> 3730.30]  I mean, the CPU business unit is kind of the company darling at the moment.
[3730.96 --> 3736.38]  If I was AMD, I know what I'd be doing with my allocation.
[3738.20 --> 3738.56]  All right.
[3738.72 --> 3739.50]  Speaking of...
[3740.56 --> 3742.50]  OK, now this is not segwayable.
[3743.56 --> 3752.82]  But Tom's Hardware is reporting that SSD bait and switching means you might not get the performance that you expect when you buy an SSD product.
[3752.82 --> 3756.62]  You know, part of me is actually kind of annoyed that this is in the news right now.
[3756.86 --> 3758.94]  Because just...
[3758.94 --> 3759.90]  Man, I wish...
[3759.90 --> 3761.62]  I'm going to check this spreadsheet.
[3762.32 --> 3766.98]  But I think it was like days ago that I was like, hey, yeah, that's like a thing.
[3767.28 --> 3768.94]  We should make a video about that.
[3770.48 --> 3773.54]  This should be illegal is the title that I wanted to have for the video.
[3773.66 --> 3774.66]  So I'll probably still do it.
[3774.74 --> 3775.80]  We'll do it in the next little bit.
[3776.30 --> 3777.82]  But basically it talks about...
[3778.30 --> 3779.00]  Here's my notes.
[3779.00 --> 3785.88]  Taking a product that has been revised throughout its life cycle silently, like an SSD, hurting performance, is my notes.
[3785.90 --> 3787.36]  And I put that in like a few days ago.
[3787.42 --> 3790.48]  And now it's like breaking news and everybody's going to be talking about it.
[3790.96 --> 3791.44]  That's OK.
[3791.50 --> 3793.10]  I still have a good title, so it shouldn't matter.
[3793.44 --> 3795.54]  People will click the crap out of a title like that.
[3795.62 --> 3796.42]  So it's fine.
[3796.50 --> 3797.50]  I'm just annoyed.
[3797.98 --> 3800.02]  Anyway, Luke, why don't you want to see this one?
[3800.56 --> 3802.62]  What do you think if the revision is documented?
[3802.62 --> 3813.24]  If the revision is documented and does not negatively impact performance in any way that is not overcome by some other benefit, then I'm fine with it.
[3813.38 --> 3815.08]  Silent revisions are fine.
[3815.10 --> 3816.00]  What would another benefit be?
[3816.18 --> 3818.10]  Like a cost down or something like that?
[3818.16 --> 3820.24]  Like if, like, let's say an SSD.
[3820.42 --> 3821.60]  Let's use an SSD as an example.
[3821.72 --> 3823.62]  No, a cost down is not a benefit to the consumer.
[3823.76 --> 3825.48]  A cost down is a benefit to the manufacturer.
[3825.76 --> 3829.74]  And they can spin it as a benefit to the consumer if they actually lower the price.
[3829.74 --> 3832.06]  But a cost down is just a cost down.
[3833.20 --> 3842.88]  So the way that I see it, if, like, let's say an SSD, they changed out the controller such that the sequential reads and writes no longer meet the manufacturer spec,
[3843.26 --> 3852.60]  but the random performance is actually marginally better, such that in a real-world scenario that most customers would use it in, it actually performs a little better.
[3852.72 --> 3853.36]  I'd say that's fine.
[3856.42 --> 3856.86]  OK.
[3857.48 --> 3857.74]  Yeah.
[3857.90 --> 3858.72]  That's my take on that.
[3859.00 --> 3859.44]  Yeah.
[3859.74 --> 3869.50]  So what's going on here is the Tom's Hardware released a report this week regarding SSD manufacturers changing not just NAND flash, but also the SSD controllers.
[3869.76 --> 3871.48]  That is really kind of crazy.
[3871.68 --> 3873.60]  It's a much bigger change than changing the flash.
[3874.22 --> 3874.46]  Yeah.
[3874.66 --> 3879.02]  The flash, like, that's, I mean, maybe not so hot, but I'm not too surprised it's happening.
[3879.18 --> 3881.04]  Changing the whole controller is pretty wild.
[3881.36 --> 3887.12]  And there's ways you can change the flash that don't hurt the performance or don't in a meaningful way.
[3887.12 --> 3897.32]  And I would maybe argue that this is why usually I'd say when you're doing benchmarks, you don't use your old numbers.
[3897.32 --> 3900.92]  But I guess in this case, they would have the old SSD.
[3901.44 --> 3901.64]  Yeah.
[3901.70 --> 3901.92]  Anyways.
[3902.00 --> 3904.02]  So even if they rerun it, they would get the same numbers.
[3904.24 --> 3904.40]  It wouldn't matter.
[3904.52 --> 3904.64]  Yeah.
[3904.80 --> 3905.00]  Yep.
[3905.16 --> 3906.28]  Still, you should rerun it.
[3906.32 --> 3908.16]  But yeah, in this case, that wouldn't have saved them at all.
[3908.20 --> 3909.56]  So completely ignore that.
[3909.56 --> 3914.78]  The report looks closely at specifically, but I'm sure it happens to more than just this.
[3915.10 --> 3918.46]  ADATIS XPG-SX8200 Pro.
[3918.86 --> 3921.64]  Tom's Hardware originally reviewed this back in 2018.
[3921.64 --> 3926.04]  And the drive sat on their best SSDs list for quite some time.
[3926.40 --> 3936.30]  These running changes that have happened to this SSD have had a massive impact on performance with a 41% slowdown in file copy performance.
[3936.30 --> 3944.98]  And it says in the document, a 500 megabyte per second decline in light workloads after the unreported changes.
[3945.50 --> 3947.08]  Tis a big oof, sir.
[3947.66 --> 3949.62]  That's a massive oof, I would say.
[3951.02 --> 3952.54]  That's pretty rough.
[3952.92 --> 3961.20]  As Tom's updated their top listed SSDs in favor of new releases, they noted that ADATA had changed their controller, firmware, and NAND.
[3961.54 --> 3963.76]  It's a new device entirely.
[3963.76 --> 3965.80]  Just with the same product name.
[3966.56 --> 3966.94]  What is this?
[3967.12 --> 3968.88]  It's like Theseus's ship or whatever?
[3969.74 --> 3970.40]  What is it?
[3971.30 --> 3972.26]  There's this story.
[3972.38 --> 3975.32]  I think it's Theseus's ship, but I don't fully remember.
[3975.70 --> 3983.04]  Where there's this ship and through the course of sailing it over years and years and years ago, it undergoes repairs constantly, right?
[3983.10 --> 3983.40]  Sure.
[3983.66 --> 3987.16]  But at a certain point, every single part of the ship has been replaced.
[3987.32 --> 3988.22]  Is it the same ship?
[3988.74 --> 3989.38]  Ah, here we go.
[3989.38 --> 3994.20]  Even though the materials it's made of change, the shape, the name, and the design stay the same.
[3994.66 --> 3995.88]  So it is the same ship.
[3996.26 --> 4000.54]  If other people think it's the same ship, that's another way of thinking about it.
[4001.76 --> 4005.26]  There's the whole philosophy, foundation.org, ship of Theseus thing.
[4005.34 --> 4005.44]  Yep.
[4005.44 --> 4006.50]  Okay, so that's a whole thing.
[4006.62 --> 4007.10]  Whole thing.
[4007.20 --> 4007.72]  Whole rabbit hole.
[4007.94 --> 4009.62]  It's like the SSD of Theseus.
[4010.54 --> 4012.86]  Is it the same SSD?
[4013.02 --> 4017.68]  If they can convince all of you that it's the same SSD, then is it the same SSD?
[4018.18 --> 4018.50]  Yeah.
[4018.92 --> 4019.92]  The answer is no.
[4020.76 --> 4021.12]  Yeah.
[4021.12 --> 4024.14]  Not when you change the controller firmware and name.
[4024.16 --> 4026.12]  The answer is no, you butthead.
[4026.42 --> 4027.54]  That's the real answer.
[4027.54 --> 4029.46]  You should change the name and sell it as something different.
[4029.46 --> 4034.74]  Now, it's not uncommon for manufacturers to be forced to change the parts that they use.
[4035.02 --> 4036.74]  For example, DRAM.
[4037.26 --> 4043.36]  I remember back when I first got into computers, there was a whole thing around Winbond BH5 chips
[4043.36 --> 4047.54]  being like the shiz and then being discontinued.
[4047.74 --> 4050.64]  And then it was Samsung TCCDs.
[4050.78 --> 4052.94]  And then I think they were called UTT.
[4053.38 --> 4056.58]  So UTT was short for untested, apparently.
[4057.22 --> 4063.18]  And a lot of manufacturers, notably OCZ, I shouldn't say manufacturers, a lot of DRAM sellers,
[4063.58 --> 4071.16]  notably OCZ would sell TCCD products, which were Samsung chips that had really good overclocking
[4071.16 --> 4072.44]  characteristics, very efficient.
[4072.44 --> 4073.96]  They'd run at really low voltages.
[4074.66 --> 4081.08]  And then they would have basically the same or very similar product, not easily discernible
[4081.08 --> 4084.48]  to the consumer, that would have these UTT dyes in them.
[4084.94 --> 4086.94]  And they were great for overclocking.
[4087.06 --> 4089.74]  They would sell these overclocking-centric SKUs.
[4090.22 --> 4092.32]  And then they would just warranty them.
[4092.46 --> 4096.40]  They would rate them to these crazy voltages that people were happy enough to pump through
[4096.40 --> 4096.88]  their RAM.
[4098.20 --> 4101.44]  But they were just crappy dyes that were cheap.
[4101.44 --> 4106.96]  And so companies were just, like OCZ, were just selling them as premium memory and then
[4106.96 --> 4110.78]  just warrantying them at these crazy voltages, knowing that a bunch of them were going to
[4110.78 --> 4111.06]  die.
[4111.16 --> 4113.60]  And it was like this whole, it was this whole crazy thing.
[4114.08 --> 4116.24]  And I forget where I was going with this story.
[4116.32 --> 4117.04]  But the point is, right.
[4117.34 --> 4119.36]  The point is, BH5s went away.
[4119.36 --> 4121.68]  TCCDs eventually went away.
[4122.08 --> 4126.26]  And that doesn't mean that all of a sudden a Corsair or OCZ or a Mushkin or whoever the
[4126.26 --> 4129.74]  case may be, that doesn't mean that all of a sudden they don't still need to sell like,
[4130.20 --> 4136.80]  you know, the 3200 megahertz CL5, you know, RAM kit.
[4136.80 --> 4141.04]  Um, so they've got to put something on it.
[4141.18 --> 4145.32]  So in a lot of cases, the DRAM chips, and you'll see this with graphics cards too, the
[4145.32 --> 4146.38]  DRAM chips can change.
[4146.58 --> 4150.54]  And I'm okay with that as long as they don't use anything that doesn't meet the spec.
[4151.66 --> 4158.04]  SSDs are one of those products where they can still reach the spec.
[4158.04 --> 4164.42]  If all they spec it in, if all they spec is like sequential reads and writes, it can still
[4164.42 --> 4167.22]  reach the spec without having the same performance characteristics.
[4167.38 --> 4172.14]  So it becomes this really, um, kind of scary gray area for consumers.
[4172.92 --> 4177.92]  Um, I think, I don't know if this is a note from Tom's Hardware or Hexis who have both reported
[4177.92 --> 4180.38]  on this, but it is, it is a good best practice.
[4180.56 --> 4184.70]  If you want to know that exactly what you buy is going to be exactly what was reviewed
[4184.70 --> 4191.06]  six, nine, 12, 18 months ago, then buying from an SSD manufacturer who is vertically integrated
[4191.06 --> 4193.24]  like Samsung is a pretty good bet.
[4193.36 --> 4197.54]  Intel, to my knowledge, also has not pulled these shenanigans, but I do know that some
[4197.54 --> 4199.30]  others, I know Kingston's done it.
[4199.38 --> 4206.38]  I know Adata's done it, um, have pulled this kind of crap, um, and not been very transparent
[4206.38 --> 4206.94]  about it.
[4207.24 --> 4212.94]  Uh, I remember having a really funny experience once, uh, with a stick of Corsair XMS2 memory.
[4212.94 --> 4215.22]  The revision, like the version number.
[4215.58 --> 4217.44]  So they'd have a part number and then a version number.
[4217.56 --> 4220.86]  The version number was like 17 point something.
[4221.28 --> 4226.44]  And I'm like, how many different sets of dyes have you had on this thing?
[4226.50 --> 4227.16]  This is incredible.
[4227.40 --> 4230.12]  Cause DDR2 was around for a long time by that point.
[4230.34 --> 4231.78]  And it just, it amused me.
[4231.84 --> 4232.68]  It amused me a lot.
[4233.08 --> 4234.80]  That's, that's all I have to say about that now.
[4235.74 --> 4239.78]  I just realized I had you on, whoops, didn't mean to do that.
[4239.78 --> 4241.22]  I had you on a monitor.
[4241.34 --> 4242.32]  I don't normally have you on.
[4242.58 --> 4246.66]  So I realized this, this whole show, I've just been looking like off the window.
[4246.82 --> 4247.52]  So sorry.
[4247.64 --> 4248.62]  I've now fixed that.
[4250.10 --> 4251.98]  Um, where did I put the WAN doc?
[4252.18 --> 4253.98]  But yeah, this is, uh, this is brutal.
[4254.12 --> 4257.10]  I don't necessarily think we need to go through a ton of the rest of the notes.
[4257.10 --> 4263.56]  Um, it covers a lot of stuff that, uh, that, that you just covered to be completely honest.
[4264.18 --> 4267.26]  Um, but yeah, this is not good.
[4267.70 --> 4269.70]  And I'm, I'm happy they released that.
[4269.78 --> 4271.00]  I hope you release your video.
[4271.24 --> 4273.30]  I think it'll be really interesting to dive into.
[4273.50 --> 4277.04]  I, I think some amount is fine.
[4277.04 --> 4282.02]  And if the, if the difference is relatively negligible, like it's not really that big of
[4282.02 --> 4282.32]  a deal.
[4282.32 --> 4286.82]  Like if the performance drop was like, if it existed and if it was measurable, but like
[4286.82 --> 4291.52]  it was pretty darn small, like sometimes you just got to do what you got to do.
[4291.58 --> 4293.52]  You might not be able to get the supplies you had in the past.
[4293.86 --> 4295.30]  It's remarketing.
[4295.42 --> 4297.96]  This whole new device is going to be a nightmare, blah, blah, blah.
[4298.34 --> 4299.96]  Like it's, it, it sucks.
[4300.12 --> 4301.26]  It's not good for the consumer.
[4301.58 --> 4303.70]  It's not good for the manufacturer.
[4303.70 --> 4308.52]  It's not good for anybody, but like maybe it has to happen, but dropping 41% improvement
[4308.52 --> 4311.70]  and all these other crazy things just as completely unacceptable.
[4311.70 --> 4315.08]  And the worst case is the ones where they like clearly know it's going to happen.
[4315.08 --> 4318.82]  Like they send out review devices and then like almost immediately they rev the product.
[4319.14 --> 4319.58]  Yeah.
[4319.72 --> 4320.40]  That's dirty.
[4320.52 --> 4323.24]  And like, this has been a thing in like thumb drives forever.
[4323.60 --> 4326.76]  But the difference is that nobody ever cared because they were thumb drives.
[4327.92 --> 4330.20]  But I mean, it's actually kind of funny to think about.
[4330.20 --> 4335.96]  I remember like back in the early 2000s, mid 2000s, thumb drive reviews were totally a thing,
[4336.54 --> 4338.88]  especially right around the time USB 3 was coming out.
[4338.96 --> 4340.16]  So it was like late 2000s.
[4340.16 --> 4341.92]  Thumb drive reviews, absolutely a thing.
[4342.38 --> 4345.02]  So you would send out your thumb drive for review.
[4345.22 --> 4346.80]  It would be like the fastest one.
[4346.90 --> 4351.54]  And then you just rev the flash, put crappy flash on it.
[4351.60 --> 4353.94]  And now you're selling a bunch of thumb drives that are garbage.
[4354.76 --> 4358.14]  But people think it's good and they're never going to benchmark it because it's a thumb drive.
[4358.18 --> 4358.70]  Who cares?
[4360.20 --> 4360.88]  Yeah, man.
[4362.40 --> 4364.30]  Manufacturers always finding a way to do us dirty, eh?
[4364.30 --> 4368.02]  Sorry, I just I have to send you this.
[4368.44 --> 4369.04]  Oh, what's up?
[4370.48 --> 4371.58]  Do you remember this?
[4371.78 --> 4373.08]  I don't know if I have an easy way to check.
[4373.14 --> 4373.70]  Is this Discord?
[4374.56 --> 4375.40]  Oh, lordy.
[4376.10 --> 4380.84]  Patriot 16 gig holiday stocking USB drive unboxing and speed test.
[4381.28 --> 4381.56]  Okay.
[4382.06 --> 4382.80]  There you go.
[4382.96 --> 4384.20]  Luke managed to dig it up.
[4384.32 --> 4386.32]  I have personally reviewed a thumb drive.
[4386.32 --> 4389.78]  Hold on a second.
[4389.88 --> 4390.76]  No, we're pulling this up.
[4390.82 --> 4392.04]  We're pulling this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[4392.50 --> 4393.20]  Here we go.
[4394.54 --> 4397.10]  Let me just move this a little bit.
[4397.18 --> 4397.64]  There we go.
[4397.70 --> 4398.36]  There it is.
[4398.68 --> 4401.36]  Patriot 16 gig holiday stocking.
[4401.96 --> 4403.12]  Whatever thing here.
[4403.16 --> 4404.22]  We're going to listen to it together.
[4405.98 --> 4407.36]  I made that sound effect.
[4407.66 --> 4409.90]  I clinked a fork on a glass or something.
[4409.90 --> 4410.22]  I have to.
[4410.38 --> 4411.64]  I've seen this before.
[4412.06 --> 4418.48]  This is the Patriot holiday tree and the Patriot snow person politically correct USB flash drive.
[4418.56 --> 4419.90]  So the holiday tree is four gig.
[4420.32 --> 4420.70]  The snow.
[4420.74 --> 4421.92]  I was sassy, hey?
[4422.14 --> 4422.84]  Snow person.
[4423.06 --> 4425.76]  And there's one that I didn't have before and I didn't know I was getting.
[4425.84 --> 4427.48]  So I went and shot the video already.
[4427.48 --> 4431.86]  But now we have the Patriot holiday stocking.
[4432.02 --> 4432.88]  So that is the.
[4433.10 --> 4436.62]  How did I make a four minute video about a USB thumb drive?
[4436.62 --> 4439.72]  About a like holiday themed 16 gig.
[4440.06 --> 4441.02]  I think it was like a.
[4441.18 --> 4445.24]  It was either a promotional item or we got them at like a really good price or something.
[4446.18 --> 4447.82]  And look at that.
[4448.00 --> 4449.42]  12 megabytes a second.
[4449.70 --> 4451.80]  Oh, it's dropping off a little bit.
[4452.16 --> 4453.44]  I don't sound very impressed.
[4455.42 --> 4456.22]  All right.
[4456.36 --> 4457.82]  We can put that away.
[4457.84 --> 4459.02]  I don't think this was the only one we did.
[4459.12 --> 4460.72]  I remember there being a tree.
[4460.94 --> 4463.32]  No, I acknowledged it right at the beginning of that video.
[4463.32 --> 4469.04]  I was like, yeah, yeah, this is not the same thing again, but slightly different housing.
[4469.50 --> 4471.40]  I had one of those for years and years.
[4471.48 --> 4475.10]  I pulled the tree off of it because it interfered with like everything when you tried to plug it in.
[4475.18 --> 4476.84]  But I used it for many years.
[4477.06 --> 4480.82]  Served me very well at 12 to 13 megabytes a second.
[4483.52 --> 4484.58]  All right.
[4484.78 --> 4487.60]  We should do our last couple of headline topics.
[4487.92 --> 4489.32]  Risk five CPU unofficially.
[4490.04 --> 4490.86]  This is very important.
[4491.40 --> 4492.84]  Decimates Apple's M1 efficiency.
[4492.84 --> 4496.16]  This is not a big surprise if you've been following the risk five initiative.
[4496.62 --> 4503.48]  But Micromagic has a new prototype CPU that offers decent performance with record breaking efficiency.
[4504.12 --> 4505.30]  Risk five, man.
[4505.54 --> 4507.26]  This is going to be this.
[4507.46 --> 4514.70]  Like, honestly, I've seen some interesting analysts takes on NVIDIA's arm purchase going like, yo, NVIDIA.
[4515.94 --> 4517.84]  What are you doing, brah?
[4517.84 --> 4525.36]  Like, arm is arm is at their peak right now in this moment right now.
[4525.58 --> 4528.72]  Like, it is nothing but downhill from here.
[4528.80 --> 4533.78]  Now, there's it's no guarantee that risk five is going to take off or whatever.
[4533.78 --> 4537.82]  You know, we're still waiting for Linux to dominate the desktop.
[4538.16 --> 4545.36]  But yeah, as an open CPU architecture with no licensing fees or royalties or anything like that.
[4545.36 --> 4546.58]  Oh, boy.
[4546.68 --> 4549.88]  There's a lot of room for some very smart people to be contributing.
[4550.26 --> 4551.06]  And they are.
[4551.26 --> 4554.84]  And there's a lot of room for some very, very cool things to happen.
[4554.94 --> 4559.80]  In fact, there are probably there are things cool things that are happening now.
[4559.80 --> 4567.60]  But unlike arm users of risk five are not they're not required to disclose that they're using it.
[4567.60 --> 4573.28]  So there could be products and projects out there that are running risk five silicon.
[4573.48 --> 4576.94]  And you just don't even know because they're just a black box.
[4576.94 --> 4580.20]  Like there's you have no access to poke and prod at them.
[4580.20 --> 4592.34]  So Micromagic advisor Andy Huang claimed that the CPU could produce 13,000 core marks with a five gigahertz clock at 1.1 volt with lower power configurations providing even better efficiency.
[4593.14 --> 4597.96]  This the three gigahertz setup outperforms a Snapdragon 820 in the Samsung Galaxy S7.
[4597.96 --> 4601.68]  And that is at just 69 milliwatts.
[4602.60 --> 4602.96]  Nice.
[4603.44 --> 4603.84]  Nice.
[4604.22 --> 4605.04]  What's a core mark?
[4605.16 --> 4605.74]  Good question.
[4605.74 --> 4612.76]  It's a deliberately simplified platform neutral CPU benchmarking tool released by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium.
[4613.18 --> 4618.82]  And it focuses solely on the core pipeline functions of a CPU, including basic read write, integer and control operations.
[4619.46 --> 4625.46]  Ars Technica independently ran core mark on an Apple M1 Mac Mini and a Ryzen 7 4700U for comparison.
[4626.22 --> 4633.00]  And the Ryzen 7 4700U was 13,956 iterations per second per watt.
[4633.00 --> 4637.48]  While the Apple M1 was 10,947 iterations per second per watt.
[4637.64 --> 4644.04]  And the Micromagic CPU at three gigahertz was about 10 times either of them in terms of efficiency.
[4644.28 --> 4651.28]  So if you want something that's like a smartwatch that you actually don't have to charge for a week, this could be the way there.
[4652.30 --> 4653.46]  Pretty freaking incredible.
[4653.66 --> 4655.88]  We've actually talked about RISC-V before.
[4655.88 --> 4668.52]  We did a video with SyFive, who is kind of like a chip design assistance firm that is already shipping tons of RISC-V silicon.
[4669.18 --> 4674.02]  And as far as I can tell, they've just been beavering away over there since the last time we talked to them.
[4674.04 --> 4674.72]  It's been quite a while.
[4674.78 --> 4676.28]  We should actually check back in with those guys.
[4676.28 --> 4685.22]  It's not a competitor for traditional ARM and x86 CPUs in phone or laptop applications yet.
[4685.60 --> 4690.26]  But it's much closer to them than previous RISC-V implementations have been.
[4690.26 --> 4698.84]  So we are a long ways off, but it is absolutely possible that something like this could take the market by storm.
[4699.72 --> 4700.98]  Pretty cool stuff.
[4702.38 --> 4702.90]  Yeah.
[4703.04 --> 4703.36]  All right.
[4703.38 --> 4706.16]  Is there anything else that we think is really critical to cover here?
[4706.54 --> 4707.52]  We did promise to talk about the...
[4707.52 --> 4709.50]  I think the Micron fab thing is pretty cool.
[4709.66 --> 4709.96]  All right.
[4710.14 --> 4710.74]  Talk me through it.
[4711.32 --> 4717.02]  One of Micron's fabs in Taiwan went offline on Thursday, which startled the market very quickly
[4717.02 --> 4726.16]  and sent memory spot prices upwards due to supply uncertainty, even though the fab was only offline for an hour.
[4727.44 --> 4733.70]  The fab typically pumps out approximately 8.8% of the global DRAM supply.
[4733.86 --> 4734.12]  Okay.
[4734.12 --> 4739.66]  Approximately 125,000 wafers, waiver states per month.
[4740.06 --> 4740.54]  Wow.
[4740.70 --> 4740.94]  Okay.
[4742.38 --> 4748.98]  Production facility mostly makes DDR4 and LPDDR4 memory using 10 nanometer class process techniques.
[4749.54 --> 4750.84]  I just think that's wild.
[4750.98 --> 4757.50]  To be clear, when you lose power for an hour at a fab, that's a lot more than just 1 24th of a day of lost productivity.
[4757.50 --> 4757.90]  Yes.
[4757.90 --> 4761.74]  Micron says they're expecting to have it back to normal within the next few days.
[4761.74 --> 4782.72]  Because my understanding, although I don't know if this is specifically true of DRAM, but my understanding of many of these micromanufacturing techniques is that anything that is in flux in some state of the manufacturing process can be lost by a sudden power outage or a sudden offline state.
[4782.72 --> 4787.14]  So my understanding of this is very rough, but I thought it was a little bit more certain than that.
[4787.20 --> 4788.14]  I thought it was lost.
[4788.14 --> 4818.12]  I don't know.
[4818.12 --> 4819.12]  So what's the problem?
[4819.12 --> 4820.12]  I thought it was a little bit more certain than that.
[4820.12 --> 4822.12]  I thought it was a little bit more certain than that.
[4822.12 --> 4824.12]  I thought it was a little bit more certain than that.
[4824.12 --> 4829.12]  I thought it was a little bit more certain than that.
[4829.12 --> 4835.38]  But it's not because AMD says that smart access memory is like, it's like that, but like, there's like optimizations, man.
[4835.38 --> 4836.38]  Yeah.
[4836.38 --> 4848.38]  So what smart access memory does and what resizable bar enables is the CPU to access the GPU's entire memory directly.
[4848.38 --> 4852.44]  It's part of the PCI Express specification, meaning anyone can implement it.
[4852.44 --> 4857.94]  I just was expecting motherboard manufacturers to wait for Intel to say, yep, let's go ahead and do this.
[4858.68 --> 4863.50]  AMD's performance claims for smart access memory have it at roughly 5% to 10% faster than without it.
[4863.64 --> 4866.04]  And that's, we have seen that backed up in the real world.
[4866.04 --> 4873.96]  In fact, we've, I think we've seen, we've seen results even better than that range in terms of minimum frame times.
[4874.50 --> 4878.04]  So that's a big deal in terms of delivering a smoother gaming experience.
[4878.04 --> 4886.64]  And early performance data provided by Japanese tech website ASCII, is that how, yeah, okay, it's called ASCII.
[4886.72 --> 4887.08]  Okay, cool.
[4887.44 --> 4896.24]  ASCII places the Intel flavored version at similar performance levels, hinting that there's nothing inherently special about AMD's Ryzen Radeon synergies.
[4897.06 --> 4898.52]  AMD says there's more to the story, though.
[4898.52 --> 4908.36]  So we're going to have to see, you know, how this looks when NVIDIA implements it and Intel officially supports it and we can do a bunch more testing on it.
[4908.40 --> 4909.62]  But that's pretty exciting stuff.
[4910.58 --> 4910.72]  Yeah.
[4912.04 --> 4912.88]  All right.
[4913.50 --> 4921.26]  Now it's time to go check out LTT Store and see how many of you are, wow, you guys are, I did not see that one coming.
[4921.38 --> 4924.82]  I thought people were going to be like, what, $70 for a pillow?
[4924.96 --> 4926.04]  I'm going to get the little one.
[4926.04 --> 4931.30]  But the big pillow is outselling the little one by a significant margin.
[4932.58 --> 4933.84]  Did not expect that.
[4934.26 --> 4934.60]  Okay.
[4934.76 --> 4935.32]  Well, now I know.
[4935.40 --> 4936.80]  I always underestimate you guys.
[4936.86 --> 4940.28]  I'm like, oh, you know, maybe you'll be like price sensitive or whatever.
[4940.48 --> 4943.86]  And we like try and I should have just gone full alpaca wool.
[4944.12 --> 4945.78]  I should have just been like, here's a tiny pillow.
[4945.88 --> 4946.28]  It's $50.
[4949.14 --> 4951.38]  It's the best tiny pillow you'll ever buy.
[4951.48 --> 4952.12]  Yeah, exactly.
[4952.60 --> 4954.70]  You can rest your tiny little head on it.
[4954.70 --> 4956.38]  What do I tell you people?
[4957.98 --> 4958.84]  Oh, man.
[4959.50 --> 4960.04]  All right.
[4960.24 --> 4961.70]  Well, I think that's pretty.
[4961.70 --> 4961.80]  So, yeah.
[4961.90 --> 4964.68]  And there's a secret pocket in the pillow?
[4965.20 --> 4965.46]  No.
[4965.64 --> 4966.38]  What's up with?
[4966.70 --> 4967.04]  No, no.
[4967.04 --> 4967.70]  It's not a pocket.
[4968.18 --> 4970.22]  Why are you shoving money in it in one of the pictures?
[4970.66 --> 4972.42]  Oh, there is a pocket.
[4972.72 --> 4973.14]  I lied.
[4973.88 --> 4974.10]  Okay.
[4974.16 --> 4974.38]  Yes.
[4974.46 --> 4975.78]  There's a secret pocket in the pillow.
[4975.78 --> 4977.96]  Well, it's not a secret now, Luke.
[4979.70 --> 4980.70]  Way to go.
[4981.36 --> 4982.96]  Or should I say kook?
[4983.90 --> 4984.10]  What?
[4984.56 --> 4986.20]  I forget why I called you that one day.
[4986.72 --> 4988.02]  Do you remember this reference?
[4988.48 --> 4990.42]  I called you K-U-K-E at some point.
[4990.52 --> 4990.76]  Kook.
[4991.12 --> 4991.44]  Oh, no.
[4991.50 --> 4992.22]  I remember it.
[4992.24 --> 4992.96]  I don't remember why.
[4993.06 --> 4994.22]  I don't even remember when it was.
[4994.46 --> 4994.90]  I don't remember why.
[4994.90 --> 4995.40]  I don't know what happened.
[4995.58 --> 4998.18]  The big one does not have the secret pocket, by the way.
[4998.52 --> 5002.82]  The real reason the secret pocket exists, actually, is it's part of the manufacturing process.
[5003.56 --> 5005.02]  We have to, like, close it up.
[5005.02 --> 5009.50]  And on the small one, it was really hard to hide the seam to close it back up.
[5009.72 --> 5012.22]  So, this is where they filled it.
[5012.74 --> 5014.22]  And then they just jam it back in there.
[5014.30 --> 5018.12]  And then they put a zipper there so that the whole thing would just be, like, cleaner looking.
[5018.92 --> 5022.30]  So, you can see that looks, like, totally clean where the zipper is.
[5022.90 --> 5023.00]  Yeah.
[5023.00 --> 5025.78]  And then we didn't have to do that on the big one.
[5027.92 --> 5030.70]  Nick claims the big one does have it, but I don't think it does.
[5031.06 --> 5031.20]  No.
[5031.48 --> 5032.90]  Because we didn't have to do it on the big one.
[5032.96 --> 5033.38]  So, okay.
[5033.44 --> 5033.74]  I lied.
[5035.36 --> 5035.68]  Okay.
[5035.78 --> 5036.76]  Well, why are these people?
[5036.92 --> 5037.92]  Why do I think that?
[5038.42 --> 5038.72]  Okay.
[5038.74 --> 5040.94]  Apparently, the big one does have a big pocket.
[5041.50 --> 5042.04]  Look at that.
[5042.20 --> 5043.82]  I can put my whole fist in this pocket.
[5044.42 --> 5044.54]  All right.
[5044.68 --> 5044.84]  Nice.
[5045.78 --> 5046.68]  Put that in there.
[5047.32 --> 5047.90]  Never mind.
[5048.00 --> 5050.64]  Oh, and Nick is also reminding me to look at Super Chats.
[5050.64 --> 5052.04]  Why are you guys sending Super Chats?
[5052.04 --> 5054.08]  Instead of buying stuff on LTTstore.com.
[5054.18 --> 5055.38]  Like, I get it.
[5055.42 --> 5057.48]  You want to support Linus Media Group.
[5057.48 --> 5062.12]  Or joining the over 20,000 subscribers on Flowplay.
[5062.38 --> 5062.78]  Exactly.
[5063.32 --> 5063.72]  Exactly.
[5063.82 --> 5064.92]  This is what I'm talking about.
[5066.30 --> 5066.82]  All right.
[5066.88 --> 5067.10]  Fine.
[5067.18 --> 5068.28]  We'll look at the Super Chats then.
[5069.04 --> 5070.54]  I'm only going to have time to do a few.
[5070.54 --> 5074.64]  Dark Guy 2 asks, have you guys gotten in the Eve Spectrum?
[5074.96 --> 5075.52]  We have.
[5075.76 --> 5078.44]  I actually wanted to shoot that today, but I ran out of time.
[5078.54 --> 5080.64]  So, I'll probably shoot it early next week.
[5080.90 --> 5082.48]  I'm really excited to check it out.
[5084.76 --> 5090.60]  Mal asks, hey Linus, with the USA just recently banning cotton from Xinjiang, do you guys make
[5090.60 --> 5093.76]  sure your inventory doesn't contain any forced labor cotton in the supply chain?
[5093.76 --> 5096.66]  I don't know about that specific region.
[5096.98 --> 5098.82]  I am going to have to find out where this...
[5098.82 --> 5099.00]  Wait.
[5099.14 --> 5099.90]  No, we don't have any cotton.
[5100.28 --> 5100.76]  No cotton.
[5101.50 --> 5103.82]  It's alpaca wool and polyester.
[5104.28 --> 5104.50]  Woo!
[5104.64 --> 5106.66]  I think he probably means in the whole product stack.
[5107.06 --> 5107.38]  Oh!
[5108.74 --> 5110.94]  Well, we use American Apparel t-shirts.
[5110.94 --> 5114.36]  So, I don't know where they're getting their cotton.
[5115.08 --> 5118.98]  That's a great question and something we are going to have to investigate.
[5119.36 --> 5119.76]  Thank you.
[5121.48 --> 5123.02]  Andrew Wells says, money for you.
[5123.12 --> 5124.16]  No, you're doing it wrong.
[5124.50 --> 5125.92]  That's 20 US dollars.
[5126.40 --> 5127.10]  Buy a pillow!
[5127.66 --> 5128.76]  What are you doing?
[5130.98 --> 5134.56]  Tim Jennings says, why spend three videos on customer support with Secret Shopper and
[5134.56 --> 5137.50]  use Agent Sarah when you did not factor any of that into the final result?
[5137.50 --> 5141.04]  This is an insult to customer support reps and it shows they're not valued.
[5141.14 --> 5142.22]  What are you talking about?
[5142.68 --> 5145.32]  We totally factored it in when we gave our final scores.
[5145.92 --> 5147.54]  We 100% factored it in.
[5150.20 --> 5152.30]  Um, all right.
[5152.40 --> 5153.90]  Robert Mail says, hi, celebrity guest.
[5154.00 --> 5154.60]  Oh, you missed her.
[5156.88 --> 5160.56]  Oh, a new house is 500 feet from available fiber service.
[5161.04 --> 5167.40]  ISP will not take $3,000 to wire a single house, but will take $2749 a month.
[5167.50 --> 5169.94]  If I get a business account and they'll wire it then.
[5170.74 --> 5171.14]  Unbelievable.
[5171.40 --> 5171.88]  Sorry, dude.
[5172.40 --> 5174.08]  Clayton says, y'all got any GPUs?
[5174.10 --> 5174.62]  Haha, JK.
[5175.08 --> 5177.48]  Any information on 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti?
[5177.62 --> 5180.16]  I would be surprised if they launch anything like that anytime soon.
[5181.56 --> 5182.82]  Ah, what else we got?
[5183.54 --> 5185.14]  Ah, we'll take their sweet time.
[5185.36 --> 5189.54]  I looked up, um, American Apparel's, uh, policies and stuff.
[5189.54 --> 5191.56]  I haven't found a specific.
[5191.82 --> 5196.64]  So for cotton, they specifically say most of our cotton comes from the U.S.
[5196.64 --> 5201.74]  because of its high quality and strong environmental sustainability and social responsibility practices.
[5201.94 --> 5210.06]  More than 75% of the cotton acreage where our cotton is grown is irrigated using naturally occurring rainwater only, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5210.18 --> 5213.26]  They have a whole page on there about us, people dash environment.
[5213.52 --> 5214.02]  Oh, sweet.
[5214.02 --> 5216.72]  They talk about how it's all ethically and sustainably made.
[5217.12 --> 5217.42]  Okay.
[5217.90 --> 5218.52]  Well, there you go.
[5218.76 --> 5219.42]  Thank you for that.
[5220.18 --> 5224.12]  Uh, Luck Dragon says, my first and last pre-built PC was a Dell in 2007.
[5224.90 --> 5227.72]  Uh, latest PC was inspired by y'all and Jays, who says, thank you.
[5227.80 --> 5228.58]  Oh, you're welcome.
[5229.04 --> 5229.82]  You're welcome.
[5230.30 --> 5232.58]  Uh, Matthew Court says, first time watching live.
[5232.68 --> 5233.34]  Hi from New Delhi.
[5233.44 --> 5234.10]  Love the content.
[5234.10 --> 5237.44]  Any chance you could do a guide to overclocking the new 5000 series?
[5238.24 --> 5239.54]  Overclock your RAM, basically?
[5240.58 --> 5249.88]  I mean, AMD is pushing so hard to a red line that, like, there's not really a ton of headroom in Ryzen, which is like, yeah, I don't know.
[5249.96 --> 5251.66]  Takes some of the fun out of it, but, like, it's fine.
[5251.72 --> 5253.68]  It means you get a ton of performance right out of the box, right?
[5254.54 --> 5257.02]  Uh, Vorpal Bunny says, cute hat, super chat.
[5257.80 --> 5258.62]  Thank you for that.
[5259.14 --> 5260.76]  And Kinestic, final super chat.
[5260.98 --> 5261.60]  This last one.
[5261.60 --> 5265.44]  Do you support changing the industry standard name to Graphics Brick?
[5266.28 --> 5267.56]  No, I do not.
[5268.08 --> 5269.70]  We're going to keep calling them Graphics Cards.
[5270.10 --> 5271.58]  I see where you're getting at with this, though.
[5271.64 --> 5273.42]  They're not really, like, card skinny anymore.
[5274.30 --> 5274.52]  No.
[5275.22 --> 5275.84]  Oh, I lied.
[5275.94 --> 5276.54]  Pixel Plays.
[5276.78 --> 5277.60]  Is it machine washable?
[5278.38 --> 5278.74]  No.
[5278.96 --> 5280.82]  Please do not machine wash your pillow.
[5280.94 --> 5283.54]  You have to, like, clean it like you would any other pillow.
[5284.02 --> 5284.28]  Sorry.
[5285.36 --> 5287.10]  Uh, so don't let your cat pee on it.
[5287.58 --> 5288.82]  Um, dry clean only.
[5288.82 --> 5290.24]  Do not, do not bleach.
[5290.38 --> 5291.58]  Do not tumble dry.
[5291.68 --> 5292.18]  Do not iron.
[5292.48 --> 5293.02]  Do not drop.
[5294.14 --> 5294.72]  Do not.
[5295.18 --> 5295.54]  Drop.
[5295.60 --> 5296.08]  It's on the label.
[5296.36 --> 5297.24]  It says do not drop it.
[5298.10 --> 5298.66]  All right.
[5299.42 --> 5301.76]  Dakota Reno asks, why are girls so confusing?
[5302.10 --> 5307.68]  If I had the answer to that, I would have a lot more money and fame than I do now.
[5307.68 --> 5310.00]  Thanks for watching.
[5310.62 --> 5311.86]  See you again next time.
[5311.96 --> 5312.66]  Same bat time.
[5312.80 --> 5313.60]  Same bat channel.
[5314.58 --> 5314.98]  Bye.
[5315.22 --> 5317.44]  Oh, by the way, Letterkenny was not referencing us.
[5317.54 --> 5321.84]  They were referencing the same thing we are referencing, which is 1970s Batman with the
[5321.84 --> 5323.50]  whole same bat time, same bat channel thing.
[5324.10 --> 5324.94]  See you later.
[5325.10 --> 5325.82]  Yes.
[5325.82 --> 5326.18]  Yes.
[5328.48 --> 5328.86]  Yes.
[5332.66 --> 5333.32]  Yes.
[5343.48 --> 5343.98]  Yes.
[5343.98 --> 5344.56]  Yes.
[5348.56 --> 5349.04]  Yes.
[5349.40 --> 5349.54]  Yes.
[5349.94 --> 5350.62]  Yes.
[5350.62 --> 5350.94]  Yes.
[5350.94 --> 5351.52]  Yes.
[5351.52 --> 5351.92]  Yes.
[5351.92 --> 5352.04]  Yes.
