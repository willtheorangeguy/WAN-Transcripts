[0.00 → 5.84] all right we're almost live give it a sec it's just uh it's its doing things
[5.84 → 9.60] yeah it's trying it's going full effort
[9.60 → 21.00] oh what is that even happening right now uh-oh I'm flying blind I'm flying blind boys
[21.00 → 29.82] and we're live welcome to the land show merry ho ho ho day everyone it's Christmas
[29.82 → 37.14] but that will not stop me or Luke from coming to you live from canada North America
[37.14 → 41.82] yep that's where we're from all right we've got all kinds of great topics for you today
[41.82 → 48.04] which is wow it's a good thing that Santa already visited this morning because I've got a whole
[48.04 → 55.68] year left to make up for that whopper no one's been in the office this week so um we didn't even have
[55.68 → 61.16] real tech linked so I couldn't even just go back to Riley's tech linked notes and steal topics and
[61.16 → 69.66] and talking points so Luke and i literally you know this is the most classic when show we've done
[69.66 → 77.88] in probably years yeah because you and I actually did the doc yeah Luke and I actually did the doc
[77.88 → 84.24] for the wan show and I say that really loosely because Luke did like jack at all I did a topic
[84.24 → 90.44] I did one topic Luke and I did the talk for the wan show for the first time in probably years
[90.44 → 95.58] because everyone was out of the office all week so uh here we go ladies and gentlemen
[95.58 → 104.78] we've got the KFC gaming console ripped off our idea which is especially stupid because it's not even
[104.78 → 114.62] a good idea I made stencils with my 3d printer so we're going to do some story time about that
[114.62 → 124.44] what do you get Luke 60 12 gig and 3080 ti 20 gig are coming and uh tesla is offering FSD
[124.44 → 129.92] subscription service because we all knew they would of course they would let's go ahead and roll
[129.92 → 135.94] that intro we both have like Christmas dinners to get to so we're going to have to go ahead and uh
[135.94 → 140.04] we're going to have to get through the show we're going to have to get through the show today there you
[140.04 → 143.40] go there's that intro i have to close the door my daughter just ran in here
[143.40 → 152.32] like what even is the purpose of closed doors at a certain point you know someone got banned off
[152.32 → 158.54] twitch because they left the room to like to grab a snack or something and their child walked
[158.54 → 165.20] into the room um clothes and everything oh really unattended children are not allowed on stream so
[165.20 → 172.04] they got a full ban for it what like forever as far as I know yeah but I could be very wrong about
[172.04 → 177.42] that point surely they were just like some nobody I'm trying to remember like one of the two i need
[177.42 → 184.82] a LTT store toke this is terrible this is getting worse yeah yeah that'd be nice yeah I'm trying to
[184.82 → 190.30] think of one of the like twitch streamers that notoriously can't get banned for anything in spite of
[190.30 → 198.28] like being mean to animals i i i i I'm so sorry you know the funniest thing is that because I tend to pay
[198.28 → 207.04] attention to internet entertainment news my Google feed is often full of articles about uh you know
[207.04 → 215.08] dr disrespect Pokémon and all I probably like said that wrong uh doctor like okay awesome all these like
[215.08 → 222.90] uh twitch personalities and other than the top like you know I'm trying to think like how many i I could
[222.90 → 228.60] actually name off the top of my head I could probably yeah I could probably name like six
[228.60 → 234.22] of which the only reason I remember like half of them is that I've met them at some point or another
[234.22 → 242.76] and like they seemed pretty cool um but uh yeah i I don't know i just I'm always reading it is seems
[242.76 → 249.70] like the single most dramatic community of all time like there's yeah there's one guy releasing like
[249.70 → 256.44] all these like sexed messages and like hey we had a relationship and then and then there's this
[256.44 → 261.96] other one that's like uh no actually we didn't have the context wasn't there and then other people are like
[261.96 → 267.64] actually there was I I don't I don't even know I can't even keep track of if it's just like wow i
[267.64 → 273.14] thought I thought you're supposed I thought you played video games I thought that was what you did
[273.14 → 279.42] I think one of the things is because twitch i i I'm sure a lot of it is real but I think one of the
[279.42 → 284.24] things is because twitch is so bad for discoverability um they have the same type of thing
[284.24 → 289.12] that YouTube does where they make drama between each other and that promotes each other's channels
[289.12 → 297.82] and gets them actually going um but uh yeah i I think there's a little bit more real drama on twitch
[297.82 → 303.36] for one and I think the fake drama is a little bit more intense i would say that one moment
[303.36 → 308.58] please the yeah hey guys I'm closing the door for a reason please stop opening it
[308.58 → 317.58] crying out loud the chat has informed me by the way that the lady that got banned for her child
[317.58 → 323.06] being alone on her stream uh was unbanned you're doing it with her outrage you're doing it okay
[323.06 → 327.80] this is fixing my this wasn't any this was a whole this was a whole drama thing last week
[327.80 → 335.20] okay guys I even sent I even sent this to Luke okay this is how it went down last week see
[335.20 → 341.40] this is my face this is my face when the chin when the chin is behind the banner okay I fixed it I moved
[341.40 → 348.16] the banner down then we got isn't there going to be the swear word then we got this freaking guy i
[348.16 → 353.46] don't know is that does that matter are you not allowed to swear on twitch in a picture I don't know
[353.46 → 359.24] hold on a second where's my where's my stupid thing there we go look at this look at this he
[359.24 → 366.32] can't stop ladies and gentlemen he cannot stop he cannot not do it that's fine that that was it i
[366.32 → 369.84] was just I was waiting for my opportunity you sure did not make me wait long
[369.84 → 375.08] I was temporary I was fixing my sweater come on
[375.08 → 378.60] all right why don't we jump into our first topic temporary
[378.60 → 387.32] yes is my outrage at the KFC gaming console me too right okay so let's let's have a look at this
[387.32 → 392.54] thing let's have a look at this thing okay Luke I know that this is very unusual but I'm going to do
[392.54 → 397.06] all the talking and I'd like you to say nothing for a little bit here okay, okay okay hold on a
[397.06 → 405.68] second hold on here it is introducing the chocolate KFC console and the hot dog flavoured warming drawer
[405.68 → 413.00] okay no for serious though this is the KFC console power your hunger forged in the fires of the KFC ovens
[413.00 → 418.44] believable I mean who could ever think of something like this it's its complete and utter madness hold
[418.44 → 423.74] on a second though I'm not done I'm not done yet okay hold on built and designed by cooler
[423.74 → 429.12] master it's the opposite of cooling by the way it's a chicken warming drawer with only the best
[429.12 → 439.06] nook 9 extreme compute element oh yeah and I don't know a graphics card um Asus powered graphics
[439.06 → 447.16] that runs buttery smooth Asus Asus Asus uh we don't okay we don't know exactly what that is but
[447.16 → 453.72] that's okay because you got down everywhere you got fire Cuba uh we should be no we should be back up
[453.72 → 458.50] yep should be back up okay we don't know exactly it's kind of fluttering that is, but that's
[458.50 → 464.16] a temporary issue hopefully all right so back to the KFC console because this is very
[464.16 → 469.94] important we need to not get distracted here VR ready ray tracing which means it's got to be at
[469.94 → 477.40] least a RTX 2060 I guess oh maybe it's like a not announced yet thing no, no hold on Luke hold on Luke
[477.40 → 484.22] we're getting to it, we're getting to it okay 4k TV gaming 240 fps with up to 240 hertz output and you
[484.22 → 489.92] gotta power your hunger okay KFC gaming cooler master Asus and Seagate oh yeah also you know
[489.92 → 494.82] cooler master again because they like made the case or whatever all right so Luke let me ask you
[494.82 → 501.20] something let me ask you an honest question very honest question here does that remind you of anything
[501.20 → 507.64] i I feel like you guys should do it I think you guys should one-up them
[507.64 → 514.90] just hold on a second the Luke i I have to know honestly does that remind you of anything
[514.90 → 523.06] yes okay you have to tell me yeah the pizza heater they they they did an internal warming chamber
[523.06 → 531.06] uh versus the like just top mounted thing that I did um that's probably cool I guess
[531.06 → 538.84] i just I can't believe they might be doing it um it doesn't I mean there definitely is not enough
[538.84 → 544.54] information to make me think that it's like for sure happening there's no way to pre-order it uh
[544.54 → 550.12] yeah there 's's literally no offboarding links at all other than just the landing page
[550.12 → 556.54] so I have no idea it would be a weird it would be quite the out season April fool's joke
[556.54 → 565.70] um, but it also looks extremely achievable yeah because they're doing nothing exactly KFC has
[565.70 → 572.26] nothing to do with this at all KFC has meted it up, and you can't underestimate don't undersell the
[572.26 → 579.40] importance of Memling it up because honestly speaking I mean it's hilarious because if they
[579.40 → 585.16] actually go through with this which it looks like they will like in the early days of this
[585.16 → 593.18] meme nonsense I don't believe it was real I think what happened was KFC it worked too well KFC
[593.18 → 601.46] actually meted something into existence okay I suspect they got approached by intel because
[601.46 → 607.32] otherwise there's no other reason on god's green earth that you would use a nook at computer extreme
[607.32 → 615.90] element for anything that you're designing a case around because it's its small but other than that
[615.90 → 621.94] it's like very expensive for the performance that you're getting extremely like this thing is
[621.94 → 628.70] going to be very costly yeah we've got rocket lake CPUs around the corner which presumably
[628.70 → 634.06] this thing will not be using no I could be wrong maybe there'll be rocket lake they're probably canon
[634.06 → 642.56] like it's its specifically spec'd out as a UK 9 exactly, exactly probably not so intel approached
[642.56 → 648.28] a KFC that's what I think happened brought in cooler master because intel partners with cooler master
[648.28 → 654.38] and all kinds of crazy stuff whether it's you know production of uh like their uh their
[654.38 → 659.78] sub-zero thermoelectric peatier cooler thing or whatever else they work with cooler master and all
[659.78 → 664.68] kinds of stuff they approached cooler master they were like hey you guys make cases hey we make this
[664.68 → 671.30] weird thing that needs to fit in a case oh by the way uh the exhaust heat needs to keep your chicken
[671.30 → 678.94] warm, and we watched this video on Linus tech tips a number of years back that gave us the perfect idea
[678.94 → 686.34] for how to do this totally to the prototype build totally original idea okay one Mr Luke cafetière
[686.34 → 694.24] here with one of the worst like dislike ratio videos to ever be uploaded on the channel right up there
[694.24 → 699.60] with how to hide your and uh what are some of the other balls that actually looks like the
[699.60 → 704.62] like dislike has improved over time I think it probably has I think it was I think it was worse
[704.62 → 710.30] than that I think it was worse than that it was a lot closer to like one to one at one point okay can
[710.30 → 716.60] you talk us through what exactly we're looking at here Mr cafetière like uh this was a
[716.60 → 725.78] budget of nothing other than buying a pizza um and uh like I think it was a side panel that i
[725.78 → 733.68] pulled from an old scrapyard wars computer plus a test bench um and some cardboard, and we made a
[733.68 → 740.80] a panel that would actually like keep warm uh maybe it shouldn't yeah pizza warming I think it
[740.80 → 744.68] originally was called a pizza heating thing and people got upset about that we so we called it
[744.68 → 752.82] warming um, but it actually did succeed in keeping the pizza at least somewhat warm well okay you're
[752.82 → 758.08] forgetting a critical part of the story and the thing that I was so mad about because okay so this
[758.08 → 764.08] video actually generated a little bit of tension between me and Luke because I thought I was throwing
[764.08 → 771.28] him a total softball on a Friday afternoon to like to hit his video quota for the week okay and I thought i
[771.28 → 775.76] was like doing him a solid because this was something that I had planned to just kind of
[776.40 → 782.36] shard out in an afternoon uh because I was just like yeah it's so funny you've got like this heat from
[782.36 → 787.94] the computer why not do something useful with it uh oh yeah you could keep your pizza warm
[787.94 → 796.18] so Luke goes and just totally I don't know what happened I don't know how this miscommunication
[796.18 → 801.14] took place but Luke hears or maybe I didn't say it I don't know I'm not pointing fingers
[801.86 → 811.46] just the concept was pizza uh like temperature maintenance mechanism and Luke manages to turn it into
[811.46 → 816.50] pizza like heating so he gets the orders the pizza in the morning
[817.14 → 823.78] and then tries to reheat it with the computer and I was like no Luke that's why I asked you to order
[823.78 → 830.66] two pizzas so you would put one of them on the computer, and you would put one of them on the
[830.66 → 838.34] counter and see which one cooled down slower which it would have worked for way better it's not supposed
[838.34 → 845.86] to be an oven this is not easy bake afternoon this is a different kind of baked afternoon if
[845.86 → 851.54] you really think that we're going to heat the pizza with the freaking computer someone in flow plane chat
[851.54 → 858.18] was like this is why Luke doesn't work for leg any more you know what maybe um oh yeah I don't know
[858.18 → 863.54] it i there was these like additional concepts we came up with too of course we got signed out of
[863.54 → 867.46] the dock come on of course um there's these additional concepts we came up with too I don't
[867.46 → 874.74] know if you remember this, but we were theorizing using like um uh like hair dryer coils do you remember
[874.74 → 884.74] that yes I do yeah I do we wanted it to like be real warm yeah um and like there yeah we had
[884.74 → 890.58] actually taken the concept pretty far but to do it genuinely properly which it does not look like
[890.58 → 896.26] they're doing to be clear um but to do it genuinely properly it would take it would take a little bit but
[896.26 → 901.46] it's definitely possible now I've ripped on Luke a fair bit here on this topic here but can I just
[901.46 → 908.58] play can I play Luke's advocate for a second here and talk about how long I actually gave Luke to
[909.78 → 917.46] put together his concept for this and execute it um so based on that it was shot on a Friday that means
[917.46 → 923.46] we had wan show uh I know that he didn't start it until the afternoon because I remember freaking out
[923.46 → 930.50] because the pizza was there like around lunchtime and I was like why is the pizza here already and
[930.50 → 935.94] Luke's like well it's lunchtime i kind of assumed we'd like to eat the pizza after we warm it up or
[935.94 → 942.74] something and I'm like okay that's very frugal and uh efficient of you okay good job but also
[943.94 → 949.06] you haven't actually built the computer, yet you know what it doesn't matter okay we operated under much
[949.06 → 955.38] much tighter fiscal constraints back then so I think Luke actually even offered to reorder pizza
[955.38 → 960.42] for like what I had intended the concept to be which was maintaining the temperature but I was like
[960.42 → 968.26] what would that be another 50 no we better not do that so I gave Luke like minutes of notice on this
[968.26 → 974.82] and then like two hours to fully build this concept and shoot a video about it
[974.82 → 981.86] so in fairness I still probably could have done a bit better i I think if it was is it was more of
[981.86 → 987.94] a keep warm concept I think it probably would have had less negative backlash but um yeah i always kind
[987.94 → 994.82] of wanted to do a follow-up, but it was I mean it was one of the most hated videos ever it was one of
[994.82 → 999.54] the most hated videos ever I still think that might actually be a good idea to do a follow-up on because
[999.54 → 1007.22] like you could title it like our most hated video ever part two and people would be all over that
[1007.22 → 1013.78] um but i just it back when it was just Linus and I like there isn't there was very rarely enough time
[1013.78 → 1019.94] to do like big grandiose projects and to do that properly it would have been a big grandiose project
[1019.94 → 1026.74] it would have actually taken some work and neither Luke nor I has a ton of how do we say metal fabrication
[1026.74 → 1033.70] know-how you know you don't like you don't like my cuts in the side panel what are you talking about
[1034.34 → 1038.42] you know what Luke they're beautiful you know I'm going to be honest with you, we actually have a part
[1038.42 → 1044.34] two of this concept planned that I think is having like viral potential instead of trying to do anything
[1044.34 → 1051.22] with food though now that KFC has beaten that horse to death um we are actually going to build a
[1051.22 → 1059.54] water-cooled machine that has a passive passively cooled radiator that is a cat bed oh
[1061.94 → 1065.54] oh that's smart because everyone complains about them walking on your keyboard, but it's probably
[1065.54 → 1071.06] because your keyboard's warm, and they also just like to be they like to be in the middle of whatever
[1071.06 → 1077.14] you're doing like they always stuff laundry or like draw on bed warm bed might distract them so we're
[1077.14 → 1084.02] going to do the cat warming pc uh stay tuned for that one it's going to be awesome, and we've got enough
[1084.02 → 1088.50] people at the office that own cats now that it's going to be one of those things where we can actually
[1088.50 → 1095.22] test it in like a variety of uh a variety of uh people's homes and see if it actually works I suspect
[1095.22 → 1100.10] my cat's going to be super into it, but it's kind of cheating because dash will literally go sit on
[1100.66 → 1106.98] any new thing that is in any room of our house i I brought out a couple of garbage bags to uh to
[1106.98 → 1112.82] sort cardboard and then like plastic waste from opening Christmas presents this morning she immediately
[1112.82 → 1120.10] went into one of them and then went into the other one and came out and was like okay they're safe I have
[1120.10 → 1125.62] I've inspected yeah the family can rest assured that these garbage bags are fully prepared
[1125.62 → 1134.10] for their garbage thank you dash that's fantastic um oh we've got a question from john mcbane
[1136.58 → 1143.70] uh I've been re-watching early uh early seasons of the Simpsons, and it's like I never realized as a
[1143.70 → 1150.02] kid how political the show is it's like Ronald Reagan is in there constantly and stuff like that
[1150.02 → 1155.86] and only as an adult just like when I was a kid I just didn't really place the connection especially
[1155.86 → 1160.82] because it was American politics stuff yeah um so I just thought they were just characters you know
[1160.82 → 1165.22] like I didn't I didn't really necessarily clue in that they were depictions of real people
[1165.78 → 1172.50] um john cane asks why no when show Vaud on flow plane uh wrecked
[1172.50 → 1182.98] uh wrecked because reasons it's been a low priority basically yeah yeah all right cool moving on to
[1182.98 → 1188.58] oh yeah what else is there to say about KFC ripping off our idea oh yeah we do have the spec it's a core
[1188.58 → 1199.46] i9 99 ADHD it's not even 10th gen no look nine oh yeah nook9 just means core i9 based though I think
[1199.46 → 1206.26] I don't think nook9 means ninth gen i I don't know okay I'm not sure yeah um it is we don't you
[1206.26 → 1211.54] don't know how much like ram memory it's actually going to come with because the uh compute element
[1211.54 → 1219.54] is not populated with memory and the KFC spec page says nothing uh the graphics card has no details it
[1219.54 → 1225.30] just says it's from Asus there's nothing else at all no, no it also says it's buttery smooth
[1225.30 → 1230.42] and up to 240 fps in all games
[1234.18 → 1240.26] I love how they capitalize all games is this one of those things where like the marketing for it is so
[1240.26 → 1246.98] blatantly bull spit that you know if someone comes back and says hey this is false advertising KFC can
[1246.98 → 1252.10] actually with a straight face say well you couldn't have possibly believed this was real so it's kind of on
[1252.10 → 1258.98] you because I think that's a thing isn't it I think so like uh well because Red Bull, but you know
[1258.98 → 1265.22] Red Bull had to pull their Red Bull gives you wings ah so maybe it's not maybe it doesn't matter how
[1265.22 → 1272.18] obvious it is that it's not true I don't know some uh some brands have gotten away with that so i I don't
[1272.18 → 1278.66] know um probably up to I have no idea how that works yeah I'm not a clue hardly a legal expert
[1278.66 → 1282.90] can you believe over 10 000 people are watching this on Christmas don't you people have anything
[1282.90 → 1291.46] better to do meanwhile I'm here too uh let's get let's move on to our next topic wow okay what's
[1291.46 → 1299.78] going on okay so for the longest time um I have actually strung my own rackets, and it's one of those
[1299.78 → 1308.74] things that like doesn't make a ton of sense um I spent like I don't know some ungodly amount of
[1308.74 → 1314.42] money on a stringing machine because I was like nah dog I don't want like the little like manual one i
[1314.42 → 1320.42] want like the electronic one and I'm gonna I'm going to like string my rackets all the time and I'm going to do
[1320.42 → 1326.34] it so often that it's going to pay for itself and I'll even like I'll do it for like buddies and I'll charge
[1326.34 → 1331.38] than 10 bucks or whatever and like to come on get real anyway the point is I spent like thousands
[1331.38 → 1340.98] of dollars on a racket string machine that I have probably used a hundred times maybe at a grand
[1340.98 → 1347.78] total savings of about 12 to 13 dollars a pop that's that's about how much money I save doing it myself but
[1348.50 → 1355.22] one of the benefits of doing it myself is that instead of having like the brand logo you know
[1355.22 → 1362.34] Onix or leaning or whatever uh put onto the strings with like the marker I can print my
[1362.34 → 1367.46] own stencils and get my own marker ink and then I can put whatever I want, so lots of people have
[1367.46 → 1375.22] like super cool things that they stencil onto their rackets like angry pandas or whatever um so i
[1376.18 → 1382.50] got it in my head that I was like oh I have an ultimate 2 extended that sits in my side room that
[1382.50 → 1389.70] i almost never use except to print random toys off thingies for my kids I am going to make my own
[1389.70 → 1396.98] racket stencils so here's my first attempt I let my daughter pick which one she wanted i actually
[1397.62 → 1401.70] I really should have probably grabbed her racket to show you guys the end result that would have been
[1401.70 → 1406.66] a sensible thing to do whatever the point is it put black ink on the strings it worked um and she
[1406.66 → 1410.50] decided she wanted a four-leaf clover that's what that is if that's what you're trying to figure out right
[1410.50 → 1420.50] now no is that paper uh no it's filament okay yeah so anyway um I am not a 3d printing
[1420.50 → 1427.22] expert I have people like Jake and Colin and Alex to do that for me so usually when I want something
[1427.22 → 1434.10] 3d printed I'm like hey one of you can you design a thing and print it for me or Matías there 's's
[1434.10 → 1439.14] literally a half a dozen people on staff that can just kind of conjure anything I could possibly need
[1439.14 → 1445.70] and 3d print it for me so I've gone full CEO mode on 3d printing and gone you know what it's actually
[1445.70 → 1450.26] cheaper for me to hire someone to do this for me than it is for me to learn to do it myself sure so
[1450.26 → 1456.26] this is one of the first times that I have ever actually tried to create something from scratch
[1456.26 → 1464.18] to 3d print so I found this software called matter control 2.0, and it specifically has a function
[1464.18 → 1471.78] called what is it called image converter so you can just find any image you want, and it will convert
[1471.78 → 1478.66] it into a 3d model and then all you have to do is adjust the depth which um the guide that I found
[1478.66 → 1483.70] said that it the field was in millimetres turns out they have since updated the software it is now in
[1483.70 → 1490.10] centimetres that was a close call uh we almost printed a one centimetre thick stencil uh with completely
[1490.10 → 1496.82] solid fill because I didn't want it to you know do anything other than complete fill because so that
[1496.82 → 1503.30] would have been like a pound of filament or whatever at this size um anyway so they've converted that to
[1503.30 → 1509.86] centimetres we got that one figured out but the real problem for me was not that I'm a moron as far as
[1509.86 → 1516.82] 3d printing goes but actually that I'm a Photoshop moron so it has a function where you're supposed to just
[1516.82 → 1520.18] bring in any black and white image this did not start out black and white by the way it started
[1520.18 → 1526.58] out green so I had to do a whole thing in paint.net where you convert to black and white with like some
[1526.58 → 1532.26] tolerance or whatever regular paint wouldn't do it don't you hate that when something looks solid
[1532.26 → 1538.34] like a solid colour, and you get the paint bucket, and it fills in like 30 of it oh no that was an ever
[1538.34 → 1543.30] so ever slightly different shade of green so I had to figure out how to do that in paint.net
[1543.30 → 1549.30] then I ran into the real problem because all that stuff that I've like either pretty much done before
[1549.30 → 1558.74] or was very straightforward in paint.net okay I had this let me just bring up my thing here okay in
[1558.74 → 1566.66] paint.net I had this, and you would think that this isn't a problem so this right here is a transparency
[1566.66 → 1573.14] layer because I didn't want the stencil to be a rectangle right why would I want to print out
[1573.14 → 1579.30] a bunch more filament here if the racket head is an oval and my graphic is an oval shape
[1580.42 → 1588.58] I could not for the love of all that is good figure out how to get rid of it so in paint.net if i
[1588.58 → 1596.58] save as PNG theoretically this image you would think would be an oval-shaped image it's not no and when
[1596.58 → 1602.66] you search for how to get rid of chequerboard background you end up it's one of those things
[1602.66 → 1608.58] where google is too good at knowing what the problem probably is and doesn't give you anything but the
[1608.58 → 1614.98] most obvious answer so every single help thread I found was people who don't understand what a
[1614.98 → 1620.74] transparency layer is, and they were trying to get rid of it because they thought it was part of their
[1620.74 → 1628.58] image and I was like no I want an oval-shaped canvas that's what I actually want and as far as I could
[1628.58 → 1636.90] tell there was no way to do it, so my workaround ended up being to invert the colours I think what i
[1636.90 → 1644.66] ended up doing was making that actually black and then in like double inverting or rather not inverting
[1644.66 → 1652.42] the colours in matter control 2.0 so that this outer rectangle which I never did get rid of was just
[1653.06 → 1660.66] this it was blank so that is my long and boring story about 3d printing stencils and after all this
[1660.66 → 1665.38] frustration I'm finally printing the thing and my wife walks in, and she goes why didn't you just do
[1665.38 → 1673.06] that on the cry cut is that an acrylic cutter it's its like kind of an cutter it's
[1673.06 → 1681.38] like a little like it's like a little CNC cutter thing for like uh like craft clubs like it's all
[1681.38 → 1687.46] I was thinking about actually the perfect tool and i i had seen the spoiler of Ivan walking in
[1687.46 → 1691.46] and asking why he didn't just use the cry cut but all I was thinking of that whole time is like man
[1691.46 → 1699.06] there must have been like a plethora of ways to do this better like a way better tool for this job yeah
[1699.06 → 1706.66] yeah like using a 3d printer for this is wild and the thing about the cry cut too is that it comes
[1706.66 → 1714.42] with like housewife grade software like it's like kid friendly software so it's it really is
[1714.42 → 1721.38] designed to make it so that just about anyone can steal an image on Google image search and turn it
[1721.38 → 1726.50] into anything they want and meanwhile I'm figuring out how to 3d print it, but you know what Luke you
[1726.50 → 1737.06] you know what no, no you because this is so durable okay this is made of high quality PLA filament okay
[1737.62 → 1742.66] and I might have printed it the wrong size but darn if it's going to last forever
[1746.90 → 1754.74] nice, so the point of the story is guys hit me up on Twitter at actually don't use the handle that's
[1754.74 → 1760.58] on this thing use that Linus g Sebastian and I want you guys to send me what I should put on my racket
[1760.58 → 1766.98] because after all of this i I put the four leaf clover on my daughter's racket, and it worked great
[1766.98 → 1773.06] it worked exactly as I would have expected it to uh but I could not decide what to put on mine so guys
[1773.86 → 1781.14] help me out here help me out Brad that sexist not going to lie okay you're right you're right the cry cut
[1781.14 → 1789.06] in its hold on a second what is what is the colour scheme of this thing the cry cut machine in
[1789.06 → 1797.14] its soft baby blue colour scheme is definitely marketed to manly men I'm sorry i did it wrong i I said
[1797.14 → 1803.94] a bad I said a bad wrong think wrong speak thing house person it could have been any kind
[1803.94 → 1807.94] of houseperson any kind of houseperson okay
[1810.98 → 1815.86] nick Nick's messaging me already look nick you have to stop pinging the entire chat with
[1815.86 → 1824.50] teams messages I'm I'm muting your notifications see you later um okay the reason I called it that is
[1824.50 → 1831.94] because that's the only person in this house who uses it okay and only when she's not at work and not busy
[1831.94 → 1843.06] so there you go um all right what else do we have uh we've got ooh sponsors the show is brought to you
[1843.06 → 1849.78] today by oh Lord I do not have sponsor talking points okay I guess we're making it up as we go
[1850.50 → 1860.90] haha because we no longer archive previous when show talking points private internet access it's a VPN
[1860.90 → 1869.78] it helps you let Luke know that his chin is cut off by the lower third again and also Pia is good for
[1869.78 → 1878.90] keeping your ip private so you can IP privately um so no one's watching its part of your
[1878.90 → 1886.02] internet security toolkit, and you can try it you can I I forget if they have a free trial or if it's a paid
[1886.02 → 1894.90] trial, but you can definitely get some kind of trial leg.GG slash Pia when I hope that's the right vanity URL
[1894.90 → 1901.14] cool go check it out show is also brought to you by ridge wallet ah yes this one I'm this one I'm pretty good with
[1901.14 → 1908.26] okay ridge wallet save 10 at ridge wallet whatever their website is uh if you google ridge wallet you'll definitely
[1908.82 → 1913.70] land there, and you use offer code Linus, and they have more than just ridge wallets and ridge
[1913.70 → 1919.30] wallets are little wallets that are these two plates, and they're held together by like elastic bands and
[1919.30 → 1925.14] you can kind of you can put your finger into the little finger hole, and it's like, and it lets all your
[1925.14 → 1929.54] cards out and you kind of pick through them and get the one that you want, and it's like it's small it
[1929.54 → 1935.38] doesn't hold a lot of cards, but it does hold cash because it has a money clip on the side that initially
[1935.38 → 1939.22] when I first started doing these spots for them, I thought was so that you could put the ridge wallet
[1939.22 → 1944.10] on your belt, but that's not what it's for Jake called me an idiot and I remembered that forever
[1944.10 → 1950.10] thank you Jake uh, but that's okay they have more than just wallets they got other stuff so go check
[1950.10 → 1961.62] them out ridge wallet we got a link down below all right in other news lol told you so tesla has officially
[1961.62 → 1967.62] well I don't know I don't know is doing it count as a tesla announcement when Elon tweets it at this
[1967.62 → 1975.22] point I feel like legally no right but probably yes if that makes any sense um I think he's like
[1975.22 → 1980.02] not allowed anymore I don't remember um I know there was something going on with him
[1980.02 → 1984.18] and his tweets and what they were allowed to be and what they weren't allowed to be a while ago I don't
[1984.18 → 1989.38] remember what the ending of all that was uh, but he has said early next year which at this point could
[1989.38 → 1997.38] be like days from now um there will be fully self-driving uh subscription services available
[1997.38 → 2004.58] instead of one large purchase so if you like lease your car uh you could subscribe to it instead of buy
[2004.58 → 2012.58] it um also apparently the pricing just went up by two thousand dollars yeah wow I mean you know it's one
[2012.58 → 2020.90] of those things where I get it I understand why full self-driving is expensive uh because there's a
[2020.90 → 2027.30] ton of software development, and it's ongoing it's not like you can you know this isn't Final Fantasy
[2027.30 → 2034.34] two you can't just you know well no point is you can't just like write it once yeah yeah ship it and
[2034.34 → 2041.30] forget about it there's going to constantly be new edge cases that you're going to discover that like the just
[2041.30 → 2048.98] the data processing and data storage that you're going to have to maintain on an ongoing
[2048.98 → 2055.30] basis in order to keep learning and keep improving and keep remapping the world because the world is
[2055.30 → 2063.22] it's so inconvenient the world is always changing right I understand why you have to pay a mess ton of
[2063.22 → 2068.18] money for full self-driving capability on your car whether it's a tesla or whatever else it is in the
[2068.18 → 2074.82] future, but that doesn't mean that I don't have to be bummed that I can't just pay for it once now for
[2074.82 → 2082.58] now they are still offering the option to pay for it once but what we also don't know is what that
[2082.58 → 2089.62] looks like in the future um you know team viewer for example you used to be able to buy just once I own a
[2089.62 → 2095.78] perpetual license for team viewer 12 which is why I refuse to update from team viewer 12 because now with
[2095.78 → 2101.70] team viewer whatever we're on 15 or 16 or something like that there is no option to buy it outright you
[2101.70 → 2108.90] absolutely must subscribe to it as a service, so nothing would technically prevent tesla from saying
[2108.90 → 2119.22] oh, oh well oh, oh you bought full self-driving 1.0 this is full self-driving 2.0, and we're not off it's like
[2119.22 → 2127.54] got it's got you know support for the rocket boosted acceleration on the roadster 2.0 uh so yeah in
[2127.54 → 2132.58] order to account for that we really had to fine-tune some things so you really need the new software
[2133.30 → 2139.86] nothing would also prevent them from just sunsetting the original one and tesla has a long and proud
[2139.86 → 2145.78] history of announcing programs and then sort of unexpectedly or with some warnings sunsetting them
[2145.78 → 2152.34] whether it's the referral program or the free supercharging or whatever the case may be so what
[2152.34 → 2159.78] this is tesla telegraphing what the future is going to look like full self-driving buying it outright
[2159.78 → 2166.42] is either going to go away if we stay on this trajectory, or it's going to get prohibitively
[2166.42 → 2172.90] expensive to the point where it just doesn't make sense anymore and subscriptions are going to be a thing
[2172.90 → 2180.10] but for those of you who are you knowing over my dead body you know subscriptions for my car that I own
[2180.66 → 2187.38] uh I have some words of I have some words of comfort for you uh you know don't worry because in the
[2187.38 → 2193.38] future it won't matter that you never actually own the car you bought because by the time self-driving
[2193.38 → 2198.58] is actually practical to use you will not be buying a car uh because remember guys
[2198.58 → 2205.06] yeah better way of saying it I'm not just talking about the capability to fully self-drive uh that
[2205.06 → 2212.82] could be sooner I'm talking about full self-driving being actually put my feet up in the back seat and
[2212.82 → 2220.82] read a book safe have a nap like every no awareness required type of that's right every edge case that
[2220.82 → 2228.26] could possibly come up that car is going to know what to do and not only that but that level of capability
[2228.26 → 2234.34] has been around so long that notoriously slow legislators are going to have actually created
[2234.34 → 2239.78] laws to allow these things to be used without you paying attention to them on public roads by the time
[2239.78 → 2247.62] that happens you will not buy a car that's the whole idea the fleet is just gonna drive around Uber style
[2247.62 → 2253.46] and it'll be pay as you go baby the fleet owner will pay for the subscriptions and that is the future
[2253.46 → 2261.86] whether you freaking like it or not that's coming for you because there are so many things about it
[2261.86 → 2268.74] that are just I mean governments are going to eat this up what whoa hold on a second and businesses too
[2268.74 → 2276.02] I've already seen the parking regulations here in the area where we live go way down because cities are
[2276.02 → 2281.46] trying to get fewer cars parking I forget what it is but in an average city there's something like
[2282.02 → 2290.58] seven or like nine parking stalls for every car because grocery store homework these are all
[2290.58 → 2298.90] places that kind of like everyone zero rushes to all at once and these are parking stalls that sit empty
[2298.90 → 2306.74] the vast majority of the time so for cities to be able to claw back parking space for businesses
[2306.74 → 2312.34] to be able to build up for property developers to be able to build out buildings with far less
[2312.34 → 2317.86] parking in them and be able to justify it I mean there's apartment buildings in Vancouver that you
[2317.86 → 2323.86] can buy now that do not have a parking stall assigned to them that you cannot get a parking stall assigned to
[2323.86 → 2330.90] you are just expected to not own a car um so it's happening and I'm sure chat which I'm not looking at is
[2330.90 → 2336.26] full of people who live in rural Utah or whatever like they'll pry my truck for my cold dead fingers
[2337.14 → 2343.06] yeah of course there's always going to be places where that's not going to be the case but when i
[2343.06 → 2350.82] talk about the future I'm not talking about the 1930s I'm talking about the future places where it
[2350.82 → 2355.46] is the same as it has been for a hundred years yeah it'll probably be a little slower
[2355.46 → 2360.58] um so it's just like when I talk about you know fibre to the home being the future yeah it's going
[2360.58 → 2366.42] to take a long time in a lot of areas, but that doesn't change that that's the direction to work
[2366.42 → 2371.46] vehicles and stuff like that are is not really what he's talking about it's its like yeah
[2371.46 → 2377.78] it's its these like mass commodity usage cars like if you use your car essentially twice a day
[2378.34 → 2385.06] to go to go to work and to go home or to like to go to your friend's house or something and to go
[2385.06 → 2392.02] home on the weekend and that's basically if you're if you think about it that asset is more or less
[2392.02 → 2396.90] being wasted while it's just sitting there yes it loses value the more you drive around and
[2396.90 → 2401.78] the more you use it and stuff like that but um if you could use it at those times it would be more
[2401.78 → 2407.86] valuable um so even the potential idea which I don't really think will be a thing um but is where
[2407.86 → 2413.54] you could like to buy a car and sing it up for a service where it goes around and drives and picks people
[2413.54 → 2420.82] up uh maybe that'll be a thing uh the like the man what's even the name of it I think tesla has
[2420.82 → 2429.22] said that they want to allow people to uh kind of um sublet their cars that they own into the tesla
[2429.22 → 2434.50] like fleet I think this is something they've already talked about uh something else occurred to me too
[2434.50 → 2441.94] ICBC so that's our local insurance monopoly that exists for whatever reason um ICBC recently changed a
[2441.94 → 2447.14] lot of the way they're handling insurance to be more tied to the driver and less tied to the vehicle
[2447.14 → 2455.30] so that's yet another thing that is happening as the world shifts to owners just having their
[2455.30 → 2461.62] own insurance and vehicles just being like a thing that sits on the curb until you get into it and drive
[2461.62 → 2468.50] it somewhere and to be clear guys the people who are upset about this trust me it's not like I'm not
[2468.50 → 2473.78] with you, I want to own my own car so that it's like right there ready for me to use and I don't
[2473.78 → 2479.46] have to deal with someone else's smelly dog or whatever that was in the back of this shared vehicle
[2479.46 → 2486.34] like trust me I get if it's not that I'm against you, it's just that this is happening so I wouldn't
[2486.34 → 2492.90] be surprised if there was like premium like high availability options oh for sure where when a
[2492.90 → 2500.34] vehicle was not being used it like parked itself by you, you know what I mean, and it'll get all machine
[2500.34 → 2505.54] learning, and it'll now like approximately what times people like to go where and once you've got
[2505.54 → 2512.98] enough people using the service it's going to uh it's like it's kind of like anything like okay ABCs of
[2512.98 → 2521.54] gaming sells anywhere from 40 to 60 units a day on LTT store, and it's just like once you reach a certain
[2521.54 → 2528.42] scale you get that level of predictability like it just happens right um so you guys know how much
[2528.42 → 2533.22] to order and when to order it that kind of stuff like everyone thinks that they're an individual
[2533.22 → 2539.78] snowflake, but actually there are just patterns that start to emerge once the data set
[2539.78 → 2544.66] gets big enough and that's how you know Facebook and Google have gone and made a fortune right
[2544.66 → 2553.38] um so yeah it's its happening, and you know what they can pry my vault from my cold dead fingers
[2554.34 → 2559.70] and they might just do they might just do such a thing but I doubt that I doubt that my youngest child
[2559.70 → 2568.42] will see any purpose in learning to drive like at your youngest but not 12 years 12 years I suspect my
[2568.42 → 2576.98] son for a variety of reasons like aside from just like um wanting to learn it I think he would just
[2576.98 → 2582.90] want to regardless yeah, yeah okay it's kind of a control freak uh and well like and I'm not saying
[2582.90 → 2590.58] that's a bad thing like I want to operate my vehicle I am quite certain that I can operate my own vehicle
[2590.58 → 2597.54] in a way that is safer than an AI will be able to operate it for a very, very long time because I do things
[2597.54 → 2604.26] that are not technically legal but improve my safety on the road, so perfect example okay if it's
[2604.26 → 2613.14] if it's raining instead of staying in exactly the middle of my lane what I will do is I will go and i
[2613.14 → 2619.22] will just ride I'll ride the dotted line because I know that there are kinds of divots in the
[2619.22 → 2624.42] road where the tires travel the most where water tends to pool, and it's more likely to hydroplane that's
[2624.42 → 2632.82] put a bird on it, you know um so the way that so if nobody else is on the road the way that I would
[2632.82 → 2643.06] drive is absolutely illegal but from a not crashing into a barrier standpoint is safer and in much the
[2643.06 → 2651.46] same way I will often maintain like crazy buffer zones around vehicles that i you know think might not be
[2651.46 → 2655.62] able to see me very well or that I have been observing for some time and I find their behaviour
[2655.62 → 2662.98] to be erratic I'm a very defensive driver so for a long time it will be even if a self-driving car is
[2662.98 → 2668.58] safer than the average driver it will probably be safer for me to operate my vehicle than to allow a
[2668.58 → 2674.90] robot to do it however compared to me in a distracted state like if I'm hungry and I need to eat something
[2674.90 → 2681.70] well I could probably I could probably let FSD take over and I think you're going to run into some
[2681.70 → 2690.90] issues there with people that want to think that uh but probably shouldn't oh man I know so many
[2690.90 → 2703.14] of those and like um yeah Luca what are you saying by the way nothing i uh i just i I think yeah it's its
[2703.14 → 2707.70] it's its it's going to be interesting because the people aren't going to want to admit that they
[2707.70 → 2714.98] should just let a car drive itself oh yeah whereas and like i I think in a lot of cases it is just
[2714.98 → 2720.90] should because of that um like right now not good enough whatever but once it is good enough the
[2720.90 → 2726.50] the permanent awareness is going to be so huge um because the amount of things that can distract
[2727.06 → 2732.50] someone while they're driving is very high and to assume that you can always at every single
[2732.50 → 2739.94] point in time be as aware as the end goal of this thing or at least even close to the approved by
[2739.94 → 2745.62] government goal of this thing is going to be um is probably going to be Easton lovely says Linus is
[2745.62 → 2752.58] describing how motorcycle riders have to drive all the time uh yes they're good habits they're good I am
[2752.58 → 2758.74] I do ride, and they're good habits if you drive like you ride the likelihood of getting into an accident
[2758.74 → 2765.86] I mean it depends how you ride of course uh but if you ride is you ride safely if you ride defensively
[2765.86 → 2773.06] then it's its good habits for always uh just maintaining a lot of space around you, I mean the
[2773.06 → 2778.26] motorcycle is a fun one like my wife doesn't like it obviously that I ride the bike and my whole
[2778.26 → 2785.22] defence to her is like look yes if I get in an accident on the bike it's worse I'm a pancake basically
[2785.22 → 2791.14] but the odds of me getting in an accident on the bike I would argue are significantly lower I have
[2791.14 → 2797.70] so much like I have had times when I was on the bike someone went and changed lanes without freaking
[2797.70 → 2805.46] looking at all and because I was on the bike not only did I have an extra like meter or two of space
[2805.46 → 2811.14] before they would make contact with me that I was able to use to get out of the way but because of my
[2811.14 → 2818.26] ability to instantly accelerate and not to mention brake faster than a cage yeah I was able to get out
[2818.26 → 2824.18] of the way I would have gotten into an accident in that case at no fault of my own if I had been in my
[2824.18 → 2830.82] car I've also noticed when driving around um because I have not ever been on a bike um but I've noticed
[2830.82 → 2838.98] when driving around that in like annoying situations the the best people to kind of
[2838.98 → 2843.86] like you know that like no contact befriend if you know what I mean like you don't you don't
[2843.86 → 2848.42] necessarily even see each other but like yeah you're clearly not being jerks to each other is usually
[2848.42 → 2853.30] the people on bikes because they are usually paying more attention and especially in like traffic jam style
[2853.30 → 2860.82] situations people in cars like almost so many features in modern cars are like okay you don't hear
[2860.82 → 2866.34] it any more okay you don't feel the road any more okay it like yeah drives itself progressively more and
[2866.34 → 2870.50] more like it's there's all these things that are going to lull you into less and less awareness
[2870.50 → 2876.10] because you don't have to pay as much attention um and then bikes are like just not that at all
[2876.10 → 2882.18] meanders orbitals uh figures there's a little bit of natural selection at work motorcycle riders are
[2882.18 → 2892.26] generally better because the bad ones don't stick around after making mistakes um yeah okay um sure yep that's
[2892.26 → 2897.78] fair enough um is there anything else we oh we should probably do the ISPS no longer allowed to
[2897.78 → 2904.58] charge rental fees bit yeah sure this is posted by spartaman64 over on the forum and it kind of tickled
[2904.58 → 2911.78] both me and Luke uh broadband and TV providers will finally be required to stop charging rental fees for
[2911.78 → 2917.06] equipment that customers own thanks to a new US law that takes effect on Sunday how did this take so long
[2917.06 → 2924.34] I mean to be clear like bravo it's about time some pro-consumer legislation passed um the change is
[2924.34 → 2929.46] good news for customers of frontier communications which has insisted on charging 10 rental fees to
[2929.46 → 2935.38] customers who use their own routers as we wrote sorry who's the article from Ars Technica as as
[2935.38 → 2941.62] technical wrote in July 2019 frontier claimed it charged the fee to cover higher support costs for
[2941.62 → 2946.98] customers who use their own equipment okay fair enough except that frontier also said at the time that it
[2947.38 → 2952.90] cannot support or repair non-frontier equipment contradicting its own justification for charging
[2952.90 → 2962.58] the fee ridiculous hilarious about time there's like no way in hell that it costs them ten dollars
[2962.58 → 2969.94] a month in customer support per person to support all the people with their own routers i i i I would
[2971.06 → 2976.02] just wager a guess that the people with their own routers are probably costing them less in support to be
[2976.02 → 2987.54] honest probably um last topic intel is rumoured to be taking back the gaming crown an 11 900
[2987.54 → 2994.18] engineering sample with a wimpy 1.8 gigahertz base clock uh this is a core i9 but don't worry
[2994.18 → 3002.34] a 3.8 gigahertz all core boost and maximum boost of 4.4 was spotted benchmarked uh the original source
[3002.34 → 3010.02] here is from CCF tech and Tom's hardware, and it looks like it could end up based on cine bench and
[3010.02 → 3015.86] ashes of the singularity, so there's not these are not perfect benchmarks, but their indicators looks
[3015.86 → 3024.10] like it could be as much as 20 percent faster than comet lake clock for clock which would put the gaming
[3024.10 → 3033.38] crown firmly back in intel's hands they're rumoured to come out in q1 2021 so uh hey maybe uh maybe intel
[3033.38 → 3041.14] is hoping to you know have a better year in 2021 than the just absolute pounding they took in 2020
[3041.14 → 3050.18] um yeah it's 14 nanometre still though for those who are wondering yeah oh yeah um also LTT store Boxing Day
[3050.18 → 3059.38] style oh yeah we have a Boxing Day promotion on LTT store uh five dollars off everything store wide ends tomorrow at midnight pacific time
[3059.38 → 3068.10] pacific time oh my what is that noise is that you that's my bird sorry oh what's up okay you know
[3068.10 → 3074.10] what Luke I don't think you've ever formally introduced the bird can we formally introduce the bird
[3074.74 → 3082.90] this is Aquino oh Geez he apparently wanted to be there instead his name is Aquino um he really
[3082.90 → 3088.34] enjoys talking so usually when we do the wan show he just sits there, and he pulls one foot up and he just
[3088.34 → 3093.30] stands on one foot because that's usually like he's happy and comfortable hi he likes my nose too
[3093.30 → 3098.18] for whatever reason um it's glorious now but every once in a while he wants to be engaged in the
[3098.18 → 3104.34] conversation so he'll come over and uh as you saw I guess land on my head that's that's a bit of a new
[3104.34 → 3110.98] one he only started doing that yesterday uh, but he'll start talking too, and he really likes um
[3110.98 → 3118.34] um the like wire that's next to my microphone so he'll stand on that, but that means he's standing
[3118.34 → 3125.94] on my microphone hi there you go he's standing on my microphone um you can see he perches on a single finger
[3125.94 → 3130.58] um but yeah he stands on my microphone and talks which sometimes means if I'm like
[3131.38 → 3136.82] uh having a conversation with someone you can hear Mr Aquino I'm talking about you, I noticed he got
[3136.82 → 3143.54] cancelled out pretty good what are you using uh SMB no, no I mean um like it seemed like it was
[3143.54 → 3151.38] cancelled do you have any like background noise cancellation on oh nope uh just a uh discord
[3151.38 → 3160.74] by default has an uh what is it exactly called input sensitivity oh yeah yeah not bad at all
[3160.74 → 3166.74] actually yeah it works okay all right so I guess I should do a handful of super chats but I think
[3166.74 → 3172.58] Luke has a heart out three minutes ago so I don't want to get you in trouble with plenty time okay all
[3172.58 → 3177.22] right see you later probably goodbye say bye he's just leaning towards my face he doesn't want to say
[3177.22 → 3183.70] bye at all bye all right ilia asks when comes the big shave I don't know haven't actually decided if
[3183.70 → 3190.74] I'm doing it or not oh, oh uh there we go cool uh Robert b says merry Christmas hey thank you
[3191.30 → 3197.30] Brandon says hey did you ever get used to YouTube music since google music is gone uh no i kind of i
[3197.30 → 3202.90] think I might just have to switch to Spotify um they still haven't figured out how to get kids accounts
[3202.90 → 3210.58] working because YouTube doesn't allow kids under 13 to use it so YouTube music has that same limitation
[3210.58 → 3217.70] even though my kids really they offer a family plan and kids can't use it which is super stupid
[3217.70 → 3221.70] so I'm just going to have to switch over to Spotify I think my other issue is that you can't stream
[3221.70 → 3226.18] straight to Sonos speakers through the app you could with Google play music I suspect that will
[3226.18 → 3231.70] just never get fixed because of the ongoing legal dispute between Sonos and google so I'm just gonna
[3231.70 → 3238.10] have to like manually port over my playlists I guess unless there's a faster way uh day WO asks why
[3238.10 → 3242.98] does your hair look greasy because it's super greasy I haven't gone to work all week so I have
[3242.98 → 3248.74] not washed my hair in like four days so that's what it looks like so if you were wondering if i
[3248.74 → 3257.78] normally wash my hair the answer is yes uh sweet manor glad to hear that happy to help mike Adam says
[3257.78 → 3262.18] happy Christmas guys managing to catch you live today from the UK loving the show hey thank you very much
[3262.98 → 3268.10] Finn says first time watching live by the way could LTT store be a distributor for Messi shoes since they
[3268.10 → 3275.86] don't ship them more worldwide I mean we haven't really explored the idea of just selling like other
[3275.86 → 3282.50] people's stuff I guess we could think about it but I can tell you now from like a business standpoint we
[3282.50 → 3288.66] are more interested in selling our own stuff just because you know it doesn't pollute the messaging right
[3288.66 → 3295.86] like where do you go to buy LTT stuff ltdstore.com where do you go to buy other stuff some other
[3295.86 → 3300.66] place like I don't know uh I'll think about it though johnny SM says great to see you two live
[3300.66 → 3304.66] finally what do you mean finally we can go live every week why must you have some air conditioning
[3304.66 → 3311.86] in your home server room I do not are they hot and loud um they're like loudish but not hot because
[3311.86 → 3317.06] what I do have is a fan in there I made a video about that a while back and then uh with the new
[3317.06 → 3322.10] insulation that we blew into the attic space actually there's no exhaust for it but I can
[3322.10 → 3326.10] open up a door into my other attic space in the summer in the winter the cold air coming in is so
[3326.10 → 3332.02] cold that it's like fine um jams says hate sending super chats because hate supporting YouTube but just
[3332.02 → 3337.46] wanted to say thank you for the Christmas stream you guys rock thanks jams b um Thomas die says merry
[3337.46 → 3343.54] Christmas merry Christmas to you too Thomas die uh mike Adams says please use do not disturb on Teams
[3343.54 → 3348.02] uh it mutes all notifications, and then it doesn't make me think my work's trying to get a hold of me
[3348.02 → 3352.98] okay I did mute it I muted it with the volume mixer, but that's another way to do it uh Robert mail says
[3352.98 → 3358.26] with your US stimulus you can buy one of each item on LTT store single style and size and still have
[3358.26 → 3365.86] money left over hey thanks Robert that's a great tech tip right there cool man says uh hi bro and that's
[3365.86 → 3370.82] pretty much it Cole what's up Cole says merry Christmas haven't caught you guys live in a long
[3370.82 → 3377.62] time yeah how's that tj07 treating you this guy drove all the way like hours to come by like my old
[3377.62 → 3383.46] was it a tj07 I think so I think it was an old tj07 case or something like that was it a tj07 or was
[3383.46 → 3391.62] it is like some server case i I don't remember slushy says tips on being a tech YouTuber well um step one
[3392.34 → 3405.86] be a YouTuber step two focus on tech oh yeah uh I don't know I mean ah it's really hard to say it's
[3405.86 → 3410.26] it's hard to say what do you say people ask me that kind of stuff all the time and i just never really
[3410.26 → 3415.70] know how to respond to it because the answer is that I can't give you the answer if I could give you the
[3415.70 → 3427.14] answer then um like it is wouldn't be the answer if that kind of makes sense because part of breaking
[3427.14 → 3433.14] out is finding your own style and your own voice and I can't tell you what that is so that's the
[3433.14 → 3438.10] best tip I can give is that you shouldn't follow anyone else you should figure out your own path
[3438.10 → 3444.98] um Doug says I ordered a desk pad two weeks ago I can't get any updates on the order uh you got a
[3444.98 → 3449.46] message support, and they have been out all week because our whole staff has been out all week for
[3449.46 → 3454.42] Christmas, but they'll be back in on Monday and that's not a mistake I know it's the first but we
[3454.42 → 3460.98] moved the stat to this week so we are back in office on uh Monday or wait no Friday it's Friday that's the
[3460.98 → 3465.22] first right whatever it doesn't matter the point is we're back in on Monday we're in all week next week
[3465.22 → 3471.54] um we'd love to do something on solar um king of soldiers and if we did, we would definitely make
[3471.54 → 3477.86] a video about it wireless valve index is that a thing now do they have an adapter oh I hope so
[3481.06 → 3488.82] is oh is it on the way a patent says yes from July uh yeah nothing has developed on this since
[3488.82 → 3494.90] July so yeah we'll see we'll see just because valve patents something doesn't mean we'll see it anytime
[3494.90 → 3500.90] soon all right see you later my float plane peeps lord chuck um we're going to be restocking the
[3500.90 → 3507.06] northern lights' desk pad in a couple of months unfortunately it takes that long because we
[3507.06 → 3516.58] sold them all um so now they're gone yeah um flash says average stopping distance of all cars is around
[3516.58 → 3523.46] 132 feet and motorcycles range from 80 to 246 if you include thinking time cool thank you for that
[3523.46 → 3530.74] Linus's room appears to be almost entirely populated with doors says astromantic yes most of them are real
[3530.74 → 3543.46] and also fake real fake doors see you later ladies and gentlemen hope you enjoyed the show
