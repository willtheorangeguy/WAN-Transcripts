[0.00 → 11.12] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the WAN show. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[11.30 → 19.60] There's the RX 5600 XT launch debacle. There's the incredible news out of Gamers Nexus that some
[19.60 → 27.86] RTX 2060s are like 47% faster than other ones in productivity benchmarks. How does this kind of
[27.86 → 32.64] stuff keep happening with AMD? Well no that was bad this is both of them doing dumb stuff. Oh, just AMD
[32.64 → 37.48] bungling their launches. Well, well and just like really nice people. Random cards being way more
[37.48 → 43.22] powerful or some cards being flushable up to like well that's a video level. That's Nvidia? That's
[43.22 → 49.24] oh yeah so that's that's a whole other thing so we have so this these are two completely unrelated
[49.24 → 52.94] topics that for some reason have been combined in our yeah that doesn't make a lot of sense. Yep
[52.94 → 59.30] don't worry about if it's all good. Literally oh no virtually every Lenovo ThinkPad since 2017
[59.30 → 67.90] has defective USB type-c ports. Great. So that's pretty cool and uh speaking of cool I. Very cool.
[68.00 → 75.48] Thank you. Super cool. Thank you. Has his own shirt. I knew he was here for a milestone. I am not retiring
[75.48 → 81.62] at least at this time. I think some people actually I know for a fact some people didn't make it all
[81.62 → 87.78] the way through. Yeah, I didn't watch the end. The stream um and so the rumours of my retirement have
[87.78 → 95.64] been uh grossly exaggerated um we also have some more news uh Intel's reorging is there anything you
[95.64 → 101.12] want to highlight? Uh that is a big deal have you heard about this? Not particularly. We're definitely
[101.12 → 108.40] talking about that. But Sonos filling landfills with EOL speakers. Basically and like I'm mad. I think you
[108.40 → 114.56] should be. I am like. Furthermore, I'm super I actually didn't even pay for them, and I'm still mad. Are they going to be EOL? Um we'll
[114.56 → 124.56] talk about that, won't we? Okay. All right let's roll that intro. Let's roll it. He's going to do it. I was going to say you have to press the button. I've been thinking about rolling it.
[124.56 → 130.72] Oh that was pretty good.
[130.72 → 136.72] You'll know that I did in fact roll. I just didn't do it immediately.
[136.72 → 137.72] Yes.
[137.72 → 142.72] Keep everyone on their toes.
[142.72 → 151.60] So it's brought to you by Moss. Vulture.
[156.88 → 161.52] All right. Let's jump into the show. Okay so the first thing I want to do
[161.52 → 169.12] is a little bit of Q&A because it seems like a lot of people have some questions about what went down
[169.12 → 176.64] on Wednesday night when pretty much I sat down, and I made a few notes and because I didn't
[176.64 → 182.64] know what to say I just said everything. Um do you have any questions?
[183.44 → 188.88] Not majorly. Okay. To be completely honest. All right. Um one thing I would note right now
[188.88 → 194.24] is that if we don't actually have to really have a super normal show but if we want to we're
[194.24 → 197.84] probably going to have to cap this at some point because people will ask questions forever. We will
[197.84 → 202.72] and they'll ask super dumb ones so we're going to ignore all of those. Um okay. Like no offence
[202.72 → 208.96] it's just like. Maybe that's why he's retiring. Time is limited. Come on. Time is limited. So um okay
[208.96 → 213.04] if you've got nothing there are a couple of things I wanted to address right away. One of them is that
[213.04 → 219.44] honestly that video is the most uncomfortable I have felt about publishing a video ever. I actually sat
[219.44 → 225.04] there for about 20 minutes just like rechecking things that I already knew were as good as they
[225.04 → 230.08] were going to be because I was shooting on just like a basic webcam with no lighting. Yeah. And using just
[230.08 → 238.08] like an ancient mod mic on a not very good USB audio card because my Thunderbolt connection died
[238.08 → 242.64] because Thunderbolt's a big piece of garbage which is actually why I wired up my house with fibre optics
[242.64 → 247.12] for those USB extensions which are way better. I think just every excuse for everything now should be
[247.12 → 250.64] that's why I'm retiring. Yeah. Thunderbolt sucks and that's why I'm retiring.
[255.04 → 259.52] Uh so anyway my Thunderbolt thing wasn't working and that's what I use for my microphone
[259.52 → 265.12] and so I had to go get this like little tiny dinky USB like combo unit and like a breakout cable to
[265.12 → 269.68] and so like even for a mod mic it wasn't sounding as good as it should and there was like so there
[269.68 → 272.88] were all these little things that I kept just kind of tweaking and tuning and like oh maybe I'm
[272.88 → 277.76] going to sit more like this, and I'd play around with like the tilt on my webcam and stuff like that.
[277.76 → 283.84] I think a certain amount of that helped aid the like personability of the video. It ended up
[283.84 → 290.48] being way worse than I expected so it's funny because I've been doing this for so long that I've become
[290.48 → 296.72] so numb to the numbers. You know I upload a video and I go oh yeah that one did about 1.1 million that's
[296.72 → 303.12] okay I guess. You know or oh you know that one was a banger that one did 2 million 2 million views like
[303.12 → 312.00] cool, but I don't really think about because most of the videos that we upload um I guess don't connect
[312.00 → 319.68] with people on a personal level like don't really speak to um, but I had they don't they're not the same.
[319.68 → 328.88] I had literally hundreds of people many of whom I haven't talked to in ages just like reach out to
[328.88 → 334.80] me via every possible means and I apologize that I have not been able to reply to all of them and in
[334.80 → 341.28] fact I probably won't be able to reply to all of them. The video has like some stupid number I think
[341.28 → 347.04] it has like 25,000 comments on it, and I've actually read a significant chunk of them but not all of them.
[347.04 → 353.12] It gets a new comment on it still more than once a minute and I streamed like 36 hours ago or whatever
[353.12 → 360.64] that works out too. Currently, at 2.7 million views publicly. And the really uncomfortable part is like
[360.64 → 366.48] I don't really I tend to keep the brand front-facing and I tend to keep the person sort of behind the
[366.48 → 374.72] scenes and the thing that I felt and this is I you know this is uh it's an analogy I know it's not the
[374.72 → 385.04] same thing, but honestly I felt kind of like uh like a pornographic actor like I felt like
[385.04 → 390.80] very exposed yeah because when I was when I was recording it I was in a room by myself and there
[390.80 → 396.32] was chat, but I was actually not looking at it um I was specifically not looking at it, I was just
[396.32 → 401.44] like looking at my notes, and I was just kind of trying to talk yeah um just kind of put it out there and
[401.44 → 408.00] um and what I realized as people have been reaching out to me like with everything from hey you know
[408.00 → 412.88] do you want to grab lunch or like you know hey if you just want to talk or like hey here's my life
[412.88 → 418.56] story and here's how I know tackled these things and like just everything, and it's all like
[418.56 → 424.00] really positive actually shockingly positive, and I've even seen comments from people just being positive
[424.00 → 429.04] about how positive our community was and just being surprised because in general the internet is such
[429.04 → 437.92] a cesspool um and what I realized is that there are people watching this that I wouldn't have shared
[437.92 → 444.40] these things with if I had specifically been in a room with them and that now I have to go and sit in
[444.40 → 450.24] a room with them at some point having basically effectively balled my eyes out in front of them
[450.24 → 455.52] and this is probably going to be like a highly addressable topic for a while I on that note
[455.52 → 462.16] though yeah I would ask um I think a lot of the times when you air something like this yeah um
[462.16 → 470.24] to uh not shareholders in the sense of like stocks but shareholders stakeholders even if
[470.24 → 476.00] they're not shareholders yeah there we go when you do that um to a certain degree it can feel like
[476.00 → 482.40] you finally lifted a bunch of weight does that feel accurate at all I feel better yes I actually feel
[482.40 → 488.80] I felt better coming into work on Thursday morning than I have in a while yeah just like because I
[488.80 → 494.48] mean at least it's its there like were people who knew already um there's a person who knew
[494.48 → 498.96] already and there were people who had information like I think you and I had a perfect chat last
[498.96 → 504.48] year like 20 CES 2019 yeah it wasn't a hundred percent on nose, but it was like but like I think you
[504.48 → 512.40] I think you had some idea yeah where my headspace was that yeah um and uh so now it's just out there
[512.40 → 519.04] so it's like okay for better or for worse um you know that's where I'm at and most people at least
[519.04 → 524.08] here at the office have been perfect about it just been like you're fine right I'm like yes
[524.08 → 531.20] and they're like cool yeah you know nobody some people I saw one comment it's funny how the
[531.20 → 535.84] negative ones really stand out to you, I saw one comment about how highly inappropriate it was for
[535.84 → 543.28] an executive of a company to uh talk about something like this um you know in front of their staff
[544.00 → 553.12] and I was like here's the thing you don't know my staff yeah you don't know me you don't know them um
[553.84 → 560.08] and like line of smear group has become more corporate, but it's still very, very far from that
[560.08 → 567.84] yeah, and it will never get there yeah that is not my intention at all um the other thing is that there
[567.84 → 575.68] seems to be some confusion around it um like people were like WTF is this when the oculus video went up
[575.68 → 581.04] like 12 hours later about the quest, and it's just like me and Riley goofing around playing with
[581.04 → 586.24] like this VR headset and people were like WTF is this is such a tonal shift um you guys got
[586.24 → 595.76] to understand that when I live stream that's happening now and when you watch a video that happened a while
[595.76 → 602.88] ago and to be fair I mean you almost on that undoubtedly filmed videos the next day potentially
[602.88 → 608.88] the next morning yeah probably is yesterday fairly upbeat yeah because that's the thing is like most
[608.88 → 616.48] of the time when I'm filming videos I wouldn't call it a persona, but it's I'm definitely aware that I am
[616.48 → 622.48] an on-screen talent and my job is to perform and do a good job of being an on-screen talent because
[622.48 → 629.76] if I don't I will get fired not by not in a literal sense but like yeah I will get fired by the audience
[629.76 → 636.96] they'll be like well this guy sucks so I'm going to go watch one of the other literal hundreds of other
[636.96 → 644.08] tech content creators online I don't need this guy screw it I'm out of here um and people don't want
[644.08 → 651.12] to or at least this is my perception, and maybe I'm wrong because I was watching the uh the series that
[651.12 → 658.48] um Shane Dawson did with Jeffree Star as far as I could tell was like a six-week promotion of the
[658.48 → 662.48] makeup launch that they were obviously planning before they ever started creating that content
[663.12 → 669.36] and I was just like trying to like i actually I didn't end up being able to watch much of it
[669.36 → 677.36] unfortunately and like massive respect for those guys um and the the teams like everyone involved
[677.36 → 682.32] massive respect to everyone involved with that for like the success that they've had you know
[682.32 → 687.68] financially influence wise fame wise all that good stuff I don't get the content I just don't understand
[687.68 → 693.20] it and that's fine not I'm sure that they would watch what I do and go like sorry what is this yeah
[693.20 → 698.08] I was going to say rather different categories yeah, yeah so that's fine um but I was just so what I was
[698.08 → 704.48] about to say is my perception is people don't want to see like kind of mopey like sort of downbeat
[704.48 → 710.32] stuff so I tend to try to project that energy, but you know there were parts of that I was kind
[710.32 → 716.88] of skipping through that I was like you know this is kind of like a downer um but it's like
[716.88 → 721.04] different strokes for different folks right yeah I was going to say watching it I did not actually get
[721.04 → 726.88] that vibe really I didn't get the downer vibe oh wait with the uh the the the Jeffree Star Shane
[726.88 → 732.56] Dawson thing oh no oh watch that oh okay I'm in the same I don't really get that content sorry i
[732.56 → 738.16] thought you were talking about your stream yeah no, no okay yeah I don't know I felt like it, you had
[738.16 → 745.84] you had like comments about situations where you were down I see, but you were being open about it
[745.84 → 750.32] and I don't personally take that as a downer if that makes sense right like I wasn't like
[752.96 → 760.40] sad watching it I think at multiple points in time I think I was actually quite happy right because i
[760.40 → 768.16] think there are things that and I mean I've seen like personal life wise I've seen
[769.84 → 775.76] like your and Avon's relationship just from my angle seems extremely strong right now yeah and has
[775.76 → 780.16] seemed extremely strong for quite a while yeah we're good I think that's really cool and when you're like
[780.16 → 785.76] I want to spend more time with my wife and kids that doesn't make me sad right that's like oh that's cool
[785.76 → 790.24] cool because like not to toot your horn but I think you're a really awesome dad so you being
[790.24 → 794.32] able to spend more time with your kids being awesome dad is like that's cool well thank you
[794.32 → 801.04] no problem but like yeah i just I don't know well it didn't like yeah I guess what I'm trying to say
[801.04 → 807.20] is in general don't be surprised and confused when the videos you watch that are a production and not
[807.20 → 813.68] just like me sharing my thoughts are designed for a broader audience even outside of design though you can
[813.68 → 820.32] like be having those thoughts and those introspective like thinking sessions and stuff like that and
[820.32 → 824.80] than also go be excited about VR yeah like you don't have to be one track mind all the time right and
[824.80 → 831.76] that's the other thing too is like i kind of expected um I expected the video to like to do well in terms
[831.76 → 838.64] of the analytics I didn't expect it to be closing in on like three million views within like two days
[838.64 → 845.76] um I didn't expect to go home from work um or excuse me come home from work the next day
[845.76 → 851.52] and have my in-laws like ask me about it like I didn't expect to get like a message from my sister
[851.52 → 857.84] that's like hey I'm like sitting here sobbing my eyes out at my desk at work like are you all right
[857.84 → 861.60] I'm like I'm fine like that wasn't the point
[861.60 → 869.04] yeah I will say I don't I don't think love you boo, boo but like it didn't like to make me sad but I do
[869.04 → 873.12] think you made a lot of people cry but I don't think those things are necessarily the same okay
[873.12 → 880.80] well at any rate um what do we get here uh do you have additional comments now that you've seen
[882.16 → 886.40] like before we get into the q an is there anything you would want to add now that you've seen comments
[886.40 → 891.52] on the video because sometimes I feel that way about content like it's honestly not really um i
[891.52 → 897.76] I really did like I do feel like there's a load off my chest I really did say everything that I had to
[897.76 → 907.44] say um so I just want to clarify that no I'm not retiring um yes it's because I still have work to do
[907.44 → 913.04] here, but the main point is just that i I'm going to do it because I want to do it I'm not going to do it
[913.04 → 920.32] because I feel like i am bound to it um there I went through a period for a long time when
[920.32 → 927.52] I felt like I was doing this because I just had this ongoing responsibility to make sure that everyone
[927.52 → 934.24] under this roof keeps making their mortgage payments um and that's still there obviously i
[934.24 → 941.20] think that any honest entrepreneur with half of a soul or excuse me entrepreneur any obvious um like
[941.20 → 946.48] business owner I guess that's sort of a synonym whatever it doesn't matter any anyone with half
[946.48 → 952.72] a soul who is responsible for a team of people should feel that way um but I'm not going to let that
[953.60 → 959.28] dictate how i why I'm doing it anymore and so if I were to ultimately make some kind of decision
[959.28 → 965.68] like if I was to say okay look I'm going to step back to a part-time or I'm gonna whatever it
[965.68 → 971.68] ends up looking like um I'm just going to make sure that I'm putting my work into equipping the
[971.68 → 978.08] people here with the tools that they need to keep it going and I think that um it's the community's
[978.08 → 982.48] reaction has been really encouraging I've seen a lot of people just say like hey your team's awesome
[982.48 → 989.52] we love them so like yeah do your you do you and we'll, we'll make it work um i I do think a lot
[989.52 → 995.28] of that is kind of like hangs remember hangs people would write it in your yearbook oh yeah
[995.28 → 999.12] you know have a great summer yeah we should totally get together and then like it's totally meaningless
[999.12 → 1004.16] and here's my cell number yeah you know that will never happen that's that that's yeah it's not
[1004.16 → 1010.24] happening and the reality of it is our habits online are more algorithmically driven than
[1010.24 → 1015.60] ever before and in spite of many of those people having the best intentions to keep up
[1015.60 → 1023.52] they wouldn't um, but it's still really nice to hear even if I know that a lot of it is um and a lot
[1023.52 → 1031.04] of it probably is true just to be very clear but a lot of it is not um and not intentionally um so i
[1031.04 → 1044.24] actually don't really see any uh so who's your favourite cross code character oh it's got to be uh um oh man
[1045.76 → 1050.40] how do you for reference that I know I came in with some amount of pre-existing information
[1050.40 → 1054.32] but i at no point in time in that video thought you were like immediately bailing
[1054.80 → 1059.28] because I noticed the specific wording of the title I was very careful not to clickbait it
[1060.80 → 1065.44] um gotta be Emily I love her she's she's amazing that's my favourite character
[1066.64 → 1072.80] um turning leg into a cooperative after retiring I have no idea how a cooperative is structured
[1072.80 → 1077.04] um I doubt it though yeah
[1080.00 → 1086.96] cooperative business model what is this it's an alternate business model which responds to the
[1086.96 → 1090.32] needs of all stakeholders employees customers suppliers local community investors future
[1090.32 → 1094.32] generations as well as investors that sounds like some pretty pie in the sky bull crap right there
[1094.32 → 1100.96] um so no idea uh okay
[1101.76 → 1108.64] you're doing wow yeah people don't really seem to have a lot of questions I think like there was
[1108.64 → 1115.60] articles posted and stuff like that which were like clearly someone skimmed the video or has no
[1115.60 → 1123.12] idea who I am doesn't know yeah just like wrote some stuff about like your stats and said you're retiring
[1123.12 → 1127.52] but I think the community as a whole like actually watched it and gets it and if you watch the
[1127.52 → 1131.68] whole thing it's fairly conclusive okay like I didn't really expect you were going to have
[1131.68 → 1135.84] additional comments when I asked about it cool all right well thank you so much guys you guys rock
[1135.84 → 1143.68] um all right so let's move on to some tech news yeah the Rx 5600 XT launch was a bit of a fiasco i
[1143.68 → 1150.24] actually clarified it a little bit on the am I retiring or not what's going on live stream um but I feel like
[1150.24 → 1156.24] I should do it more formally here because I did not cover it adequately in our launch video of the
[1156.24 → 1162.72] 5600 XT and I did a very bad job of making the situation better on tech with the tech wiki
[1163.76 → 1171.60] yeah so you know what I watched both of those things after the live stream and with that context on
[1171.60 → 1179.92] if it was just hilarious terrible terrible terrible so AMD released the Rx 5600 XT on Tuesday the 22nd
[1180.64 → 1186.48] and virtually everyone's been talking about nothing but the v bios update from day zero so what went
[1186.48 → 1195.92] down is we had intended to do our 5600 XT content as like an overclocking experiment with the card
[1195.92 → 1201.04] because we'd gotten a wink and a nudge that there was a lot of overclocking headroom and I'm not going
[1201.04 → 1204.80] to say who the wink and nudge came from because I don't know how much of this communication is NDA'd
[1204.80 → 1212.40] made, but we had yeah like a shot in the ribs and a that there was a lot of over probably do this yeah
[1212.40 → 1218.08] so we structured the entire video around that, and then we like to found out about this v bios update we
[1218.08 → 1223.60] got our card updated, so our numbers are fine which was why I thought it was not a big deal because
[1223.60 → 1231.20] I got the sequence of events out of order I didn't know how last minute it was, and effectively we were
[1231.20 → 1238.88] still waiting on a response to find out like what's the deal here is this v bios update a one shot thing
[1238.88 → 1244.48] on just this one particular card is it because we got like engineering samples yeah by the way we
[1244.48 → 1253.20] noticed that overclocking headroom that was hinted at to us like well this fee bios seems to take
[1253.20 → 1260.80] up a lot of it so um so what's what um so anyway we but we went ahead we like overclocked the card we
[1260.80 → 1268.88] did end up we got better performance numbers um with our overclocking testing and what I didn't know
[1268.88 → 1273.36] what I didn't realize because I'd spaced out while Anthony was talking to me about the situation
[1273.92 → 1281.60] was that AMD didn't have a coherent plan for updating some of the cards that would go to end
[1281.60 → 1285.20] users right that were already updated like to me, it was a nothingburger because I was like
[1286.32 → 1292.08] who cares we get pre-launch firmware updates all the time as long as they're available to the end user
[1292.08 → 1297.68] it doesn't matter because they will never see this pre-launch state of the product but in this case
[1297.68 → 1305.60] because updating the uh bios of a graphics card is a non-trivial matter for most users some people
[1305.60 → 1311.20] were going to end up stuck with it and so it was kind of a problem because they were gonna watch a review
[1311.20 → 1316.16] like ours where we take this card that's fast at stock and even faster overclocked, and it was
[1316.16 → 1320.40] going to be slower at stock even though it would theoretically have a bunch of overclocking lots of
[1320.40 → 1328.40] people don't overclock their graphics cards I don't bother any more mine still are but I understand
[1329.04 → 1333.76] why most people wouldn't I've just always really particularly enjoyed graphics card overclocking
[1333.76 → 1340.48] I don't necessarily know why i also mostly played beat safer so hey man you were talking to me about
[1340.48 → 1348.08] the like literally runs on a quest yeah that's fair well no because okay I was talking about how I wish
[1348.08 → 1354.56] that the polling rates for the tracking which were higher I was just saying like if there's a min-maxing
[1354.56 → 1360.64] beat safer player out there it's probably you I'm I'm actually getting pretty good there's reasonably
[1360.64 → 1366.00] popular songs that I'm like getting close to cracking like top 100 for that's pretty cool
[1366.00 → 1370.96] yeah that's pretty cool uh and by the way did Jaden have any response to my significantly higher score
[1370.96 → 1377.76] than you told me not to tell him I did yeah oh no I want him to know okay well now he yeah I want
[1377.76 → 1383.52] him to know now he knows so jade none of Luke's colleagues at float plane and technically my colleague
[1383.52 → 1389.60] as well even though Luke does most of the work um he went out of his way to crap on my parade
[1389.60 → 1396.08] very quickly at Luke's behest yeah i asked him if he could do it when I was trying to full
[1396.08 → 1403.12] combo supernova and expert plus and beat safer, and anyway he did it, but he did it really sloppily
[1403.12 → 1411.68] quite frankly and my score is nearly 50 000 higher than his so um and I have full combed it now so
[1411.68 → 1418.24] there you go Jaden there's your challenge anyway um I have an I have a screenshot too I have a proof
[1418.24 → 1424.16] screenshot so Anthony was super upset about the situation with the 5600 XT because
[1425.12 → 1430.08] fortunately he had been busy with something else for the two days prior to the v bios update otherwise
[1430.08 → 1434.24] he would have basically had to do his testing twice yeah and then because the communication
[1434.24 → 1440.96] around the situation was so terrible we weren't able to message it correctly in our video because
[1440.96 → 1445.76] they were still like hey yeah let us look into this what do you mean let you look into it, you know
[1445.76 → 1451.92] what you're doing yeah you have to know now so you so just tell us yeah and this is just the kind of
[1451.92 → 1460.72] sloppy stuff that is really frustrating for us where it's like just communicate you have one job as PR
[1460.72 → 1470.08] or well press relations one job to be fair their one job is probably to mislead you at that moment
[1470.08 → 1478.56] I don't think so what's the point it's going to blow up yeah, but your initial video sounds more positive
[1479.52 → 1485.60] yeah, but my initial video doesn't have to be more or less positive it can just be informative
[1486.64 → 1492.24] yeah hey by the way there are a handful of cards out there that have this v bios here's how you update it
[1492.24 → 1497.28] I did a video about this don't have seven years ago but if they don't have a solution, but they do
[1497.28 → 1504.96] have a solution yeah updating the v bios I think yeah but they probably suspect most end users
[1504.96 → 1511.28] even with your video from forever ago aren't going to be able to do it so yeah and upgrading v bios on
[1511.28 → 1518.24] graphics cards is kind of scary it is realistically you should have an ups most people do not have an ups
[1518.24 → 1526.56] uh so that's what happened I'm sorry I screwed it up it was not Anthony's fault I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1526.56 → 1533.36] throw AMD under the bus a little bit here but not directly necessarily meanwhile on team green VGA
[1533.36 → 1542.00] launched the RTX 2060 KO for 300 just prior to the embargo left of 5600 XT at the time it seemed like
[1542.00 → 1547.52] uh hey look at me, we've got a low-priced RTX 2060 do do do do I can be cheap too
[1549.04 → 1555.36] um but gamers nexus quickly discovered something interesting about it unlike previous RTX 2060s
[1555.36 → 1563.60] which used the tu106 which is a smaller actual die it's a completely different GPU
[1564.32 → 1574.88] the RTX 2060 KO from VGA the specific card used a tu104 derived GPU, so this is a bigger chip it's an
[1574.88 → 1580.64] entirely different processor it's the same one that's in the RTX 2080, and then it's just got some
[1580.64 → 1586.56] Cuba cores that are fused off in order to just hack it back down to RTX 2060 levels of performance
[1587.20 → 1594.00] and it kind of sounds like binning which it kind of is these might have been you know bad tu104s
[1594.00 → 1599.12] likely yeah yeah however it has performance implications for applications like blender where
[1599.12 → 1605.92] improvements are of up to 47 are possible because architecturally the chip is actually quite different
[1606.48 → 1612.72] so it's unknown whether that GPU will make it's way on to other sort of bargain-basement 2060 cards VGA was
[1612.72 → 1618.64] apparently not aware that they were receiving different GPUs for the KO but I find that a little
[1618.64 → 1628.40] bit hard to believe yeah what how could you possibly not know that VGA is a pretty um engineering centric
[1628.40 → 1635.04] company a lot of people think that VGA is one of those like you know slap uh slap our label on it
[1635.04 → 1643.20] and resell it type of company because in the early days um they were more like that so you know back
[1643.20 → 1649.60] when I'm talking back when it was you know like BFG and VGA and I'm trying to remember who the heck
[1649.60 → 1655.52] else even I miss BFG but the reason why I miss BFG is entirely why they're gone taking advantage of
[1655.52 → 1661.68] their lifetime warranty you wants to i did it too they offered it I mean it's not my fault yeah they
[1661.68 → 1668.40] had a lifetime warranty anyway so the point is way back then it was pretty common for uh just branding
[1668.40 → 1674.24] companies to just take graphics cards that were made by actual engineering companies and then figure out
[1674.24 → 1679.04] some other way to add value to it whether it was through game bundles that they negotiated or t-shirts
[1679.04 → 1683.60] that they put in the box a new sticker a poster in a game or great customer service whatever
[1683.60 → 1688.96] the case may be um but over the years I mean VGA if I recall correctly they bought chain tech's
[1688.96 → 1696.00] motherboard uh or was it EPOS I can't remember they bought epochs it was either epochs or
[1696.00 → 1700.24] chain tech I don't know they bought one of them when that uh motherboard company they're like ditched
[1700.24 → 1705.20] their enthusiast division or something like that, but they have actual engineers on staff now I find it
[1705.20 → 1712.72] very, very hard to believe that given how deeply involved in the hardware and firmware engineering
[1713.36 → 1719.20] and like overclocking tools um I find it very hard to believe that they accidentally put the wrong
[1719.20 → 1725.44] chip or like didn't realize it was a completely different chip on their uh on their cards because
[1725.44 → 1731.68] they don't look the same um so here hold on a second that's what I was going to say is like visually
[1731.68 → 1739.28] they're different yeah like it's not here let's find a die shot of a TU 104 hopefully my screen works
[1739.28 → 1742.32] here okay so here's a TU 104
[1744.64 → 1756.32] unfortunately I can't see the die size I wish I could um TU 106 die size, so anyway that's that's the die so TU 106
[1756.32 → 1769.84] is uh 445 millimetres square TU 104 die size 545 millimetres square they are physically a different
[1769.84 → 1777.92] size yeah like if you just like look at them, they look different one of them is bigger i just I find
[1777.92 → 1784.80] it very, very hard to believe like your cooler would almost certainly change um not necessarily but the PCB
[1784.80 → 1792.56] would have to change it's a different chip so but isn't there more power delivery so one of the
[1792.56 → 1796.24] things that I think gamers nexus is still working on you guys should definitely check out his follow-up
[1796.24 → 1802.00] coverage of this is whether the TU 106 based ones might have more overclocking headroom because it's
[1802.00 → 1807.60] a less power hungry chip okay um so the t it might end up being a trade-off um no one's saying like
[1807.60 → 1815.68] don't buy don't buy it or anything because you know it's like it, they're both fine if all
[1815.68 → 1819.76] you're doing is gaming you probably will never notice a difference but if you're more interested
[1819.76 → 1824.16] in productivity you might want to go for a TU 104 based one and if you're more interested in like i
[1824.16 → 1827.44] want to squeeze the maximum amount of overclocking potential out of this thing you might be less
[1827.44 → 1834.16] likely to hit a power limitation on a TU 106 not confirmed yet to my knowledge um all right what else
[1834.16 → 1841.12] we got for oh actually you know what we need to jump right into our sponsors for today moss
[1841.76 → 1848.56] moss organizer is in the business of keeping here we go hey there it is look it's a Luke sized one
[1848.56 → 1852.56] moss organizers in the business of keeping you protected and organized with simple products they
[1852.56 → 1858.72] just released their latest iteration of the black pack it fits laptops up to 15.6 inches it's made of 1680
[1858.72 → 1864.00] d ballistic nylon for abrasion and tear resistance it's orange on the inside so you can find your stuff
[1864.48 → 1871.12] and the new version features two external pockets wow both water and power cord pockets are
[1871.12 → 1875.28] located outside the bag, and it even fits a LTT water bottle by the way lttstore.com
[1876.56 → 1884.64] uh something use offer code Linus tech to get 15 off everything in your order including
[1884.64 → 1891.28] that bag finally the show is brought to you by vulture is a global sorry go ahead have
[1891.28 → 1895.76] you guys had ad spots from them before I'm I don't think so actually we use them for float play
[1896.32 → 1901.36] well there you go there's a little added thing for you vulture is a global cloud hosting
[1901.36 → 1905.76] service allowing you to easily deploy cloud servers bare metal and storage from all over the world
[1905.76 → 1911.12] they offer 16 server locations worldwide they've got advanced networking with both high speed public and
[1911.12 → 1916.00] private networking they can deploy instances with your preferred operating system they've got
[1916.00 → 1921.12] one click apps so you can deploy popular applications and games you can upload your own OS if you'd like
[1921.12 → 1925.20] and you can get from prototype to production in seconds with their simple control panel and API
[1925.20 → 1929.68] how's your experience been with them this is very dangerous to ask because I do not expect you to lie
[1929.68 → 1937.60] during a sponsor spot but go ahead in almost all cases pretty good okay just be honest
[1937.60 → 1946.48] uh that's the one where the wan show went down because the server oh okay so is that the only
[1946.48 → 1951.76] time we've had a problem yes other than that it has actually been quite fantastic they are a big part
[1951.76 → 1956.88] of the reason why when we did the roast everything went well okay yeah all right so there's
[1956.88 → 1963.28] definitely wins in that department there were two losses, but there were many wins so okay check out
[1963.28 → 1969.20] today it's been very solid overall leg.GG slash vulture wan we've got that linked down below
[1972.00 → 1978.08] oh holy crap okay um sorry, sorry I'm going to have to shill for one second here
[1979.36 → 1980.80] hold on what's it going to be about
[1983.36 → 1990.00] lttstory.com oh yeah guys we have a commemorative 10 million subscribers uh shirt
[1990.00 → 1997.76] so if you want to oh it's sold as a pre-order all shirts will be printed and shipped within three
[1997.76 → 2003.52] weeks apparently so there you go it's in our one-off it's in our regular sizing its our regular
[2003.52 → 2007.92] type of shirt unlike the float plane beta squadron one which was on all cotton I forget what the reason
[2007.92 → 2014.72] for that was uh this one is on an American Apparel um uh blended one so like just it's a completely
[2014.72 → 2021.20] normal shirt except it has this design on it so we're just going to sell it for a limited period
[2021.20 → 2027.04] of time, and then it's gone it's a pickaxe which a lot of people have asked about because diamond
[2027.04 → 2032.48] because 10 million diamond play buttons it was a pickaxe well no they've asked why it has a pickaxe on it
[2033.12 → 2038.16] and it was just like I don't know well a just looks kind of cool yeah, and they were like what
[2038.16 → 2043.60] minecraft I'm like it doesn't look like a minecraft pickaxe it looks like a regular pick these are not
[2043.60 → 2048.00] minecraft diamonds aren't even valuable in minecraft you know how hard it is to get a
[2048.00 → 2052.48] diamond play button diamonds are pretty valuable in minecraft are they I thought they weren't that
[2052.48 → 2059.12] valuable compared to like rubies uh they're still pretty valuable okay what's more valuable than
[2059.12 → 2068.40] diamonds in minecraft yeah I'm not a minecraft veteran enough um okay but there 's's
[2068.40 → 2073.52] probably some stuff I don't know I thought diamonds were just like kind of crap I got I don't know
[2073.52 → 2080.08] they're definitely not kind of crap I know that I know we are finally getting somewhat close to the
[2080.08 → 2085.36] minecraft server launching I will say we had a little thing the other day yeah Walter has a
[2085.36 → 2092.64] one button setup for that they don't have a one button setup for like a video streaming so you know
[2092.64 → 2097.60] what I was just going to say I've actually come up with what I think is a very clever new nickname
[2097.60 → 2100.96] for the lead on that project I'm going to call him float plane Jake
[2104.96 → 2106.00] oh zing
[2107.84 → 2110.72] not bad I remember when he told me it was gonna launch in December
[2113.92 → 2119.36] okay what's so I'm not trying to dig what is the holdup in his what are you guys working on
[2119.36 → 2126.00] it's like actually on a completely different level from what we initially set out I'm sure
[2126.00 → 2129.36] or else it would have been up in a day because I've seen him put up minecraft servers before
[2129.36 → 2133.44] so like I know there's stuff going on yeah because I have played on servers that Jake has there's like
[2133.44 → 2139.68] all these like game modes and there's like this hub that you land in, and it's like a whole giant thing
[2140.24 → 2146.48] and there's like really going to town all this load balancing between multiple instances and crap like
[2146.48 → 2151.68] that server that we built to be the ultimate minecraft it's completely dismantled um we're
[2151.68 → 2158.72] we're hosting it out of a data centre um we may end up reassembling that and there's a data centre that
[2158.72 → 2163.36] we might be able to send it to okay so we could so just so that we could claim the moral victory is
[2163.36 → 2170.64] technically involved of that some of our players are actually playing on it um but no it's an it's
[2170.64 → 2178.64] apparently and I have seen some stuff it looks really legit it's like not just a minecraft server
[2178.64 → 2186.40] okay it's like pretty cool the bad news is that it has actually taken a significant amount of resources
[2186.40 → 2192.24] so while our initial intent was for it to just be like lol you know everyone just play on it, we're
[2192.24 → 2198.80] going to have donations and stuff that's why I've been confused is because I remember when it was like
[2198.80 → 2203.52] oh yeah it's live everyone's playing on it, we're going to make some tiny tweaks, and it's going to be done
[2203.52 → 2212.24] on Monday no I've had this experience a lot at flow plane yeah so I get it so the scope of the
[2212.24 → 2221.52] project changed yeah quite dramatically and really um without my explicit approval um you know kind of
[2221.52 → 2227.76] like how the whole thing started without my explicit approval like i said yeah you know like
[2228.32 → 2234.00] let's okay here's where I run into trouble I said yeah let's do it up right
[2236.16 → 2244.96] and Jake took that to mean let's do it up the rightest let's do it up perfect yeah so what I really meant
[2244.96 → 2252.72] was you know hey I want to make sure that it's a bit you know a couple of hundred people that come on it
[2252.72 → 2258.88] are going to be like yeah this is not total crap it's pretty sweet I have a new minecraft home yeah yeah
[2258.88 → 2265.20] not even that like I just want to chill with like other definitely I know they are like tech geeks and
[2265.20 → 2270.40] we're going to like build video cards in minecraft or whatever like I just wanted it to be like a minecraft
[2270.40 → 2276.24] server he's trying to build the minecraft server he wants it to be people's new homes right and I'm
[2276.24 → 2286.08] like okay sure he's been pitching us getting into like game server hosting basically since he started
[2286.08 → 2292.72] yeah he's super passionate about it and my whole thing is that like I tell people hey if you have a
[2292.72 → 2298.40] passion project I want to do my best to support it and so every once in a while somebody asks me to put
[2298.40 → 2307.36] up or shut up, and you're like oh and I'm like well Jake has ended up writing um
[2310.32 → 2315.92] two videos in the last like eight weeks or something like that because he has been actually
[2316.48 → 2323.36] hammering away at this or should I say pickaxing away at it hey got him um oh boy
[2323.36 → 2330.56] so yeah we're gonna we're going to do we're going to do our best anyway sounds like when I wanted to film
[2331.28 → 2339.28] uh WTF is going on with that two video series that I did yes, yes and I had extremely low production
[2339.28 → 2344.00] for a very long time yes you did yeah yeah I watched those recently and I'm still pretty proud of them
[2344.00 → 2349.20] good so that's cool good I had to pick up a lot of slack for a little bit there but I was happy to do it
[2349.20 → 2355.44] happy to do it yeah um so anyway it has an axon excuse me an axe it has a pickaxe on it is has nothing
[2355.44 → 2360.24] to do with minecraft we do have a minecraft server coming it's totally unrelated and by the way this
[2360.24 → 2366.88] is 10 million in binary which is which I think is cute I think it's cool once you know which is cool
[2366.88 → 2371.20] but it's really misleading at the beginning um what do you think it's what do you think it is I didn't
[2371.20 → 2377.84] know well it's not misleading it just doesn't lead you anywhere sure doesn't lead you down the wrong path
[2377.84 → 2383.44] or does it did you think it was like well no i just yeah so I guess you're right because I was
[2383.44 → 2390.72] just like what yeah um one thing is that this picture is not exactly no so it's kind of got like
[2390.72 → 2396.24] a weathered look like it does in uh yeah on our shirts which is actually kind of hard to see on camera
[2397.12 → 2402.40] um so yeah there's like kind of like some holes in the printing it's not really that yeah it's not
[2402.40 → 2407.52] really intense weathering, but it's enough that it looks like it's kind of like rough-hewn you know
[2407.52 → 2411.92] yeah like you went out, and you got that diamond yourself and yeah your pickaxe is worn now yeah
[2411.92 → 2417.44] but you didn't yeah because it's hard unless I don't know like PewDiePie's watching or something
[2417.44 → 2425.52] which he's not so because he's on vacation yeah uh all right so let's move on to more tech topics
[2426.32 → 2431.76] yeah in terms of the like random news articles saying you retired it just felt extremely PewDiePie
[2432.40 → 2438.08] yeah it's all the PewDiePie ones are like he quit he didn't quit he didn't say he was going to quit no
[2438.08 → 2444.00] I mean in fairness to them, he does like actually play that clickbait game and his was a little bit
[2444.00 → 2448.16] more misleading I'm deleting my whole channel you know like that kind of thing um
[2450.64 → 2457.84] this is rough so he did technically this is posted by spartaman64 on the forum virtually every Lenovo
[2457.84 → 2465.76] ThinkPad since 2017 apparently has defective USB ports nice um, so there's an official Lenovo support
[2465.76 → 2470.24] page outlining at least three dozen affected models and symptoms include the USB port simply not
[2470.24 → 2475.20] working the thunderbolt controller disappearing from device manager HDMI output failure and even hanging
[2475.20 → 2480.32] during post said to occur within six to 12 months of typical usage there's a preventative driver update
[2480.32 → 2485.84] for affected models, but there's no word on what that entails exactly for performance and power delivery
[2485.84 → 2492.24] um once the issue presents itself only a motherboard swap will fix it that is pretty rough especially
[2492.24 → 2499.92] for a brand that is known for building tanks that are designed disguised as computers yeah you have to
[2499.92 → 2505.92] gotta give Lenovo a little bit of a shout-out for uh consistently giving us um news topics thank you guys
[2506.80 → 2512.24] um your motherboards having spyware built into them to USB ports not, not working I appreciate it
[2512.24 → 2521.20] uh, uh EU and google propose a ban on facial recognition the EU is considering a new law that
[2521.20 → 2527.12] would prevent private and public actors from using facial recognition in public spaces for a definitive
[2527.12 → 2534.00] period like three to five years Microsoft says it's bad because they're developing facial recognition
[2534.00 → 2539.20] yeah you don't say uh they say you don't ban it if you actually believe there's a reasonable alternative
[2539.20 → 2543.92] that will enable us to say address this problem with a scalpel instead of a meat cleaver said brad smith
[2543.92 → 2549.44] Microsoft president uh google supports the move which is interesting to me which is shocking yeah
[2549.44 → 2552.96] I think it's important that governments and regulators tackle it sooner rather than later and
[2552.96 → 2557.52] give a framework for it although in light of some of the recent fines that they've received some of which
[2557.52 → 2564.40] have actually been more than a slap on the wrist like the copper one um I can see why Google might say
[2564.40 → 2570.32] well yeah okay fine why don't you lay out your stupid ground rules, and then we'll go and like
[2570.32 → 2575.28] innovate a bunch of stuff, and we'll, we'll wait instead of the other way around yeah yeah no that
[2575.28 → 2580.48] that kind of does make sense from their angle I guess I think it's oh man I'm torn actually
[2581.28 → 2586.96] so this is so this is private and public does this include government because I know uh UK is like
[2586.96 → 2592.40] super well known for just having cameras everywhere yeah, so this would be uh in public spaces
[2592.40 → 2599.36] okay yes so you would still be able to develop it and test it just not in public spaces in your
[2599.36 → 2604.40] store or whatever else Alex apparently put some of his own thoughts in here says this is a really
[2604.40 → 2611.92] good idea um but counterintuitively the accuracy of um facial recognition apparently drops as you add
[2611.92 → 2617.52] more faces to the pool, but that would also get better as the algorithms continue to learn yeah
[2618.08 → 2622.32] um yeah it gets better when you add more of one face, but it doesn't get better when you add more of
[2622.32 → 2631.68] a bunch of faces if that makes sense ah, so yeah there are a lot of issues with facial recognition
[2631.68 → 2636.88] uh here's a fun example at uh the Notting Hill carnival where two million people attended the police
[2636.88 → 2642.88] used facial recognition to try to find wanted criminals 96 people were flagged, and only one was
[2642.88 → 2649.36] actually wanted and had already been arrested so it's obvious there's a lot of work to be done but
[2649.36 → 2653.76] my sort of flip side argument to this and take this as someone who has already completely given
[2653.76 → 2659.84] up their privacy and shares their innermost thoughts on the internet so like you know for me, it's like
[2659.84 → 2665.68] not only has the ship sailed it like came back and then like sailed again and came back it's a ferry
[2665.68 → 2672.48] you know it's like daily trips yeah yeah um you know from my point of view probably a surprising
[2672.48 → 2677.36] amount of the audience is actually in a pretty similar space considering the things that they
[2677.36 → 2684.32] use I'd love for it to just be better, but the flip side of that is that I don't live somewhere where
[2684.32 → 2689.68] my government is oppressing me with that said no government that is going to use facial recognition
[2689.68 → 2694.64] to oppress its citizens is going to even consider accepting this ban anyway so it's a completely academic
[2694.64 → 2702.40] conversation in that case get real china's going to be like yeah let's ban it in public spaces for
[2702.40 → 2708.48] three five years there's a large variety of different types of oppression I think people might take uh
[2710.16 → 2715.28] I don't know where I'm going with that sentence but I think people might go against that they think
[2715.28 → 2719.76] that a government that intends to use it for repression is going to ban its use in public spaces
[2719.76 → 2726.16] uh they might to itself no, no no you said uh, or maybe you didn't say this I thought you said
[2726.16 → 2731.92] uh repression in general not just this form oh just repression in general yeah yeah so like
[2732.48 → 2735.84] but there's like different kinds so they might be like yeah okay let's not use facial recognition
[2735.84 → 2740.96] but we're still gonna yeah no, no I just mean I live somewhere where I get to enjoy a very high
[2740.96 → 2747.04] level of personal freedom yeah so i you know for me, it's very easy to say like yeah I just want the
[2747.04 → 2752.24] tech to get better so that in the event that they are looking for someone who you know is running
[2752.24 → 2757.52] around with a meat cleaver murdering children that they can catch them real fast um they should add
[2757.52 → 2763.76] meat cleaver recognition um i I don't think anyone's necessarily gonna I don't think anyone's necessarily
[2763.76 → 2770.08] going to stop developing this in the background though no, no they're not use might halt yeah and I think
[2770.08 → 2775.44] it will stall development probably because it'll be a little bit harder to test on wide scale it'll make
[2775.44 → 2781.68] it more difficult with that said I totally agree that if your development plan is to just use it on
[2781.68 → 2789.12] unwitting like guinea pigs who are wandering around in the street that's a bad plan yeah so you know what
[2789.12 → 2794.56] there pay some random citizens to come around and walk around in like an arena mark down
[2794.56 → 2801.20] this day mark down this day I changed my opinion between the start of a topic and the end i already
[2801.20 → 2806.40] thought it was like a good idea but I was like well here's this counterargument i no longer have
[2806.40 → 2813.20] a counterargument I like it let's just nuke it for a few years keep developing it sort of quietly in
[2813.20 → 2817.92] the background I'm going to flip sides just to try to drag you back you have got to be kidding me no, no i
[2817.92 → 2824.16] don't want to do this so uh somewhere that they don't ban this those companies that operate out of
[2824.16 → 2829.60] those areas will now have an advantage so you're saying like Chinese companies are going to have this
[2829.60 → 2838.80] immense advantage in like AI and machine learning facial recognition oh crap so then is there like
[2838.80 → 2844.96] what are you actually really helping then because it's not going to be banned all right I'm back I'm
[2844.96 → 2849.20] back it's just being back on board don't ban if it's not even right now being proposed to be banned in
[2849.20 → 2858.16] the US nope I'm back yeah I'm back okay forget it you win twice how does it feel that was awesome
[2858.16 → 2861.92] I like it, you were just waiting to do that weren't you a little bit the whole time yeah
[2862.48 → 2868.32] you monster um we did bring up Ltd store, and we did bring up the shirts all right I don't remember
[2868.32 → 2873.44] if you said that they're really limited edition I did okay, and we have like limited stock as well
[2873.44 → 2879.36] we have limited stock I didn't know that as much as we're ever limited you know what I mean like I have
[2879.36 → 2885.28] no idea what that means these aren't going to last forever, and they will run out oh okay do oh do we
[2885.28 → 2891.36] just have like not that many blank shirts right now we did notice that there's its like a pre-order
[2891.36 → 2899.28] thing yes so is there yeah like is there a limit to our blank shirts yeah oh I thought we had lots
[2899.28 → 2904.16] of stock of black yeah but the way they're being ordered right now we're not going to have that much
[2904.16 → 2914.24] stock of black oh I see we need to get more black shirts there aren't any right so okay all of them
[2914.24 → 2923.60] okay, okay, so business talk it's hard to get enough shirts in Canada basically so if anyone
[2923.60 → 2929.28] from American Apparel is watching can you please fix that that would be great thanks because we
[2929.28 → 2935.20] really like your shirts, but you're making it very hard for us to use them there that was my sincere
[2935.20 → 2943.04] uh call for help too yeah clip it full send do you want to talk about your experience with
[2943.04 → 2950.24] the blank shirts we're working on um yeah so we've been we've been working on a replacement and
[2950.24 → 2956.72] we had what we thought was a really promising candidate the actual like feel of the material the breathability
[2956.72 → 2964.08] uh seemed perfect and then um we got uh photos of the shop where they were being made
[2964.08 → 2969.60] and everything seemed on the up and up we hadn't actually like visited it yet, but we got another
[2969.60 → 2975.20] set of samples and I like I put it on like kind of like one more time I put it on one more time and i
[2975.20 → 2980.48] was like doing things I wouldn't normally do and I took the bottom of the shirt and I went like this
[2981.36 → 2986.96] and all the thread tore all the thread broke and I was like well I'm sure glad we caught that before
[2986.96 → 2991.28] we actually booked a plane ticket out there and went to have a look at the factory I've never once
[2991.28 → 2995.36] had that happen that's not something I do all the time, but that's going to happen yeah it's going to
[2995.36 → 3002.80] get snagged on something or whatever else yeah yeah and I've had American Apparel shirts break but never
[3002.80 → 3007.04] that easily and I like went around the whole thing and I was like just like breaking all the thread I was
[3007.04 → 3012.72] like nick come on over here pull on this, and he pulls on if it's like okay so it's there's
[3012.72 → 3019.36] more to building a decent shirt than you guys might probably realize um, but we're working on it yeah
[3019.36 → 3024.00] we're working on it so if you like these shirts get one because they won't be here forever yeah
[3024.64 → 3028.88] you heard them ladies and gentlemen yeah and these are the kind of and i I've said this off camera too
[3028.88 → 3032.80] this is probably the kind of shirt I would grab because it's a cool commemorative kind of thing
[3032.80 → 3041.44] speaking of cool commemorative things um Sonos is creating a commemorative pile of still working
[3041.44 → 3048.00] electronics that don't work, and they're in a landfill anyway so that's pretty lame uh some of
[3048.00 → 3053.76] their oldest devices are no longer going to receive updates as of May 2020 so as a result they will
[3053.76 → 3060.48] eventually no longer work as services continue to change because they're not going to receive updates
[3060.48 → 3065.36] they're not explicitly breaking them they're just saying hey they might stop working at some point
[3065.36 → 3070.40] they're offering two options for affected users option one continue using these legacy products
[3070.40 → 3074.56] recognizing that your system will no longer receive updates and new features including by the way
[3074.56 → 3081.44] security updates which have been a big problem for IOT and connected devices in general yeah option
[3081.44 → 3086.88] number two trade up to a new Sonos product with a 30 credit for every legacy product you replace
[3086.88 → 3092.80] which is all fine and good except for one big problem Sonos doesn't allow you to continue to use or
[3092.80 → 3102.72] anyone to continue to use the still working device that you have they actually push an update to it
[3102.72 → 3107.84] that bricks it I believe in is it 30 days I forget what exactly the time period is um
[3107.84 → 3111.76] um
[3113.12 → 3113.44] yeah
[3116.32 → 3122.96] I think this sucks yeah basically like I understand why you don't want to support a product forever
[3122.96 → 3129.52] but a speaker is something that i kind of felt like was different in the sense that yeah go ahead
[3129.52 → 3134.64] speakers and sound equipment in general are kind of that thing where like if you is your dad inherited it
[3134.64 → 3139.28] from his dad and then like gave it to you when he bought a new set or something like that you kind
[3139.28 → 3145.52] of expect it to still work, and they're probably still really nice um like sound equipment does kind
[3145.52 → 3153.44] of stick around so it's its weird seeing them treated like a commodity and not just a commodity but like
[3153.44 → 3157.92] disposable even when they still work and the problem with these speakers, and it's really highlighting an
[3157.92 → 3165.04] issue with smart devices in general is that you have no control over how long they still work for
[3165.04 → 3171.28] and once the company decides that they're not going to work any more they have no purpose whatsoever
[3171.28 → 3180.32] because Sonos doesn't have just like a regular like jack in or RCA in um so they actually do get
[3180.32 → 3187.12] completely useless I remember criticizing apple back when they launched the iMac 5k oh for not having a
[3187.12 → 3200.56] monitor mode on it um what's up uh oh this is good so I just checked something Sonos CEO responds to backlash oh this is great
[3201.76 → 3208.32] how wonderful that's a cool twist we'll continue to update legacy products so let's read this on android central
[3208.80 → 3216.24] Sonos recently announced it would be ending following backlash they assure they won't be bricked in any way also working on a way to split your system between old and current devices
[3216.24 → 3220.64] so in the event that they do need to develop new features that rely on new hardware
[3221.60 → 3225.12] many of you have invested heavily we intend to honour that investment for as long as possible
[3225.12 → 3228.96] while legacy Sonos products won't get new software features we pledge to keep them updated with bug
[3228.96 → 3234.00] fixes and security patches for as long as possible that seems entirely reasonable to me okay
[3235.28 → 3239.04] worked off for an alternative solution if it runs into something core to the experience
[3240.56 → 3244.80] we heard that you heard on the issue of legacy products and modern products not being able to coexist within your
[3244.80 → 3254.40] home blah blah blah etc etc etc okay well that's something I do wonder though if it's just kind of
[3254.40 → 3258.56] delaying the inevitable I don't wonder I mean it seems like it's just delaying the inevitable, and it is very
[3258.56 → 3263.84] frustrating to see products designed in such a way that they're eventually going to be worth nothing and
[3263.84 → 3271.04] useless even though they still function um so I criticized apple over the iMac 5k because they did away with a
[3271.04 → 3275.60] mode that existed on previous iMacs that allowed you to use it as a monitor at least once the
[3275.60 → 3280.72] hardware inside was too decrepit because the screen is awesome because the screen is awesome I was like
[3280.72 → 3285.76] wow I love this screen this thing's so great could I just like use it on my pc as a monitor because i
[3285.76 → 3291.04] don't like I don't like macOS and the most expensive one the answer was no, and it was really frustrating
[3291.04 → 3295.36] for me because it basically just means that that thing is e-waste once you're done and displays are
[3295.36 → 3302.48] terrible like terrible they're basically impossible to recycle in any meaningful way because of the way
[3302.48 → 3314.24] that all the layers are laminated together um I have an update yeah what can I do for you on the wow
[3314.24 → 3322.08] thing really are you still banned or yes oh I finally got in a live chat with someone uh the call-out on
[3322.08 → 3327.76] the last wan show as far as I can tell did effectively nothing uh but I finally got in a live chat with
[3327.76 → 3334.56] someone which was surprisingly difficult to do um he opens it up saying I understand you wish to appeal
[3334.56 → 3341.28] your suspension is this correct I said yeah although even if that fails I'd really like just to understand
[3341.28 → 3345.76] what actually went wrong because I have no idea and talked about how like I play with my dad and stuff
[3345.76 → 3349.84] he said looks like the suspension has already been upheld we will not be able to discuss it any further
[3349.84 → 3356.56] I was like okay ignore the appeal can we just talk about like what actually happened because I still
[3356.56 → 3361.76] don't know are you chatting with this person live chat I still don't know and I'd like to like understand
[3361.76 → 3366.64] so I don't get banned again in the future, and he said we do not discuss that info with players I said I'm
[3367.20 → 3372.64] confused he said again we do not give any details beyond what is emailed to you those details can be used
[3372.64 → 3378.64] to make uh you more undetectable I said I'm not trying to be undetectable he says cool than you
[3378.64 → 3383.68] understand why we do not give any uh further details and cannot discuss this further was there
[3383.68 → 3388.80] any additional questions or concerns I can take a look at before we part ways uh I said I don't
[3388.80 → 3394.08] really understand how to move forward uh although I guess if that's all you can say we're done uh he
[3394.08 → 3399.04] said you're welcome to play on another account or access this one in six months
[3402.32 → 3406.40] I said well I'm rather scared that would get banned too he said if you fear that what you normally
[3406.40 → 3409.92] do in game will get you suspended then you may want to take a second look at what you're doing
[3409.92 → 3414.64] in game I said the email specifically said it's an external program not what I do in game and then
[3414.64 → 3419.84] he said since this is not something we are going to discuss any further, and you have brought up no
[3419.84 → 3422.80] other issues I must be on my way chat closed
[3425.52 → 3429.76] hands down the worst customer support experience I have ever had in my life
[3429.76 → 3443.84] horrible what completely horrible what an asshole yeah pretty much I still have no idea what happened
[3445.04 → 3453.28] and I love how like they clearly don't care because I can play on another account officially yeah you're
[3453.28 → 3463.44] going to give them more money but like right I just like what the whole thing is just ridiculous because
[3463.44 → 3470.24] normally like and I'm not trying to remove this option, but normally there's like ban evasion is a
[3470.80 → 3477.28] bad thing yeah like if you get banned temporarily or permanently off of the forum ban evasion is
[3477.28 → 3483.12] something we look into yeah it's very serious yeah and like ban evasion on a temporary ban can lead to a
[3483.12 → 3487.92] permanent ban yes, and they're like oh no, no no that's fine you can go ahead and play you can go
[3487.92 → 3493.36] play some on a different account that's no problem just not the one that we banned, and you're getting
[3493.36 → 3500.72] that one back in half a year this whole thing just none of it I still have no idea what even happened
[3500.72 → 3505.04] I don't know what program it was I don't know if it was opening for work I don't know if it was some
[3505.04 → 3507.12] other program for work who knows
[3507.12 → 3514.40] I just thought yeah I just throw that update out there i just probably burnt whatever bridge was
[3514.40 → 3522.64] possible, but that's fine I just thought it was worth airing wow well thanks blizzard thanks, thanks guys
[3522.64 → 3529.60] you guys are super awesome you provided two topics for the Sancho john does says Luke hire a lawyer and
[3529.60 → 3536.40] sue blizzard to force disclosure you have got to be kidding me no really doesn't work that way um even if it
[3536.40 → 3543.28] did no I'm not hiring a lawyer over that wow account yeah I mean all we can really do is just say that
[3543.28 → 3548.48] that's really stupid I've been in a ridiculous form of communication I can't believe that that blizzard
[3548.48 → 3553.68] account has been open for an extremely long time that wow account was from the beta of the original
[3553.68 → 3559.60] launch of wow like I've been a customer of theirs for a long time I've bought basically every blizzard
[3559.60 → 3565.76] product yeah I've played every game they've released, and they are treating you like dog crap yeah it's
[3565.76 → 3574.16] crazy it's crazy yeah um okay I feel very strongly about our float plane customer support
[3574.16 → 3581.76] at this point yeah go Tom says Luke just play the superior MMO Final Fantasy 14. No i just I don't
[3581.76 → 3588.56] really have an interest in any MMO outside that one to be honest like it that one particularly
[3588.56 → 3594.00] brings my family together really nicely right so that's a huge part of the draw there for me, I don't know
[3594.00 → 3602.40] all right i have to go guys um waif has a tummy ache and needs to be driven home so thank you guys
[3602.40 → 3607.92] very much I will try to go through a couple of super chats can't do all of them but I really can't do
[3607.92 → 3616.08] all of them there are far too many um thanks Ritz blitz uh thanks Cole oh wait I heard you talk about
[3616.08 → 3620.80] Microsoft Teams what are your thoughts on Office 365 versus g suite we actually do use both
[3620.80 → 3626.40] um they're both very different for different things I don't know teams kind of sucks they
[3626.40 → 3632.08] actually they cover a lot of similar things uh ed are you trying to send me a message or tell me
[3632.08 → 3637.28] something or thumbnail oh you want me to approve a thumbnail can i see but a lot of the things
[3637.28 → 3642.64] that they cover that are similar one of them is way better at one than the other thank-you so it's
[3642.64 → 3648.96] still quite beneficial to have both like having word and Excel is actually quite useful uh even above
[3648.96 → 3653.44] docs and sheets there are things you can do in Excel that you can't really do in sheets yeah um and
[3653.44 → 3658.80] there's certain uh Excel sheets that don't really translate well into google sheets so having excel
[3658.80 → 3665.68] is still really powerful but then Gmail is like fantastic and uh Jason carpool critics is coming
[3665.68 → 3671.44] back to float plane don't worry it's all good I already yelled at them uh okay so that's it, thanks
[3671.44 → 3676.56] guys oh yeah if you're looking for a movie podcast to watch check out carpool critics it's uh jams
[3676.56 → 3684.64] Riley and uh David's baby they feel very strongly that it is awesome and I actually have listened to
[3684.64 → 3689.92] more episodes of carpool critics than I have any other podcast ever combined uh because I listen to
[3689.92 → 3697.12] everyone and I don't really listen to podcasts um so yeah go check it out um a week ago was parasite
[3697.12 → 3700.96] um the top three movies of the decade one has actually done really well seems like people were
