[0.64 → 3.56] What is up, my ladies and gentlemen?
[3.96 → 6.32] Welcome to the WAN Show.
[6.58 → 9.64] We are going to have a fantastic show for you today.
[9.86 → 12.28] Apple has a new 13-inch MacBook.
[12.60 → 12.86] What?
[13.44 → 15.14] Apple making another MacBook?
[15.52 → 18.04] I thought they didn't even care about MacBooks anymore.
[18.18 → 20.22] I thought they just wanted to make AirPods.
[21.92 → 23.34] Actually, it does look all right.
[23.42 → 24.02] It does look all right.
[24.12 → 24.38] All right.
[24.68 → 27.28] AMD, this is really, this is the big story this week.
[27.28 → 32.26] AMD not supporting Zen 3 on older motherboards.
[32.46 → 33.74] Why are they doing this?
[34.30 → 34.68] Well...
[34.68 → 36.12] Why would they hurt everyone?
[36.54 → 40.26] Maybe, maybe they just lived long enough to become the villain,
[40.64 → 42.82] as the title of the video today seems to suggest.
[42.94 → 45.62] It is obviously a little bit more nuanced than that.
[46.10 → 46.72] What else we got?
[47.16 → 47.68] Just a little bit.
[47.98 → 51.82] Xbox Series X gameplay reveal temporarily taken down.
[52.00 → 53.50] I don't know about that part.
[53.54 → 54.98] It's definitely back up at this point.
[54.98 → 59.18] It's backlash over lack of almost any gameplay.
[59.82 → 60.52] And I watched it.
[60.68 → 61.56] And that is true.
[61.70 → 65.48] There is probably seconds worth of gameplay across a 30-minute video.
[65.62 → 66.92] I'm excited to hear about that.
[66.98 → 67.56] What else we got?
[68.54 → 71.76] And AMD releases Ry zen 3 3rd Gen.
[71.86 → 72.66] Okay, that's cheating.
[73.28 → 76.52] Anthony should not get his points for putting this topic in the WAN show, Doc,
[76.58 → 79.72] because he was the one who wrote the review that we did.
[79.78 → 82.62] So all he had to do was take his notes and copy-paste them in.
[82.62 → 84.26] Look at this.
[84.26 → 84.84] Look at this.
[84.96 → 85.52] Source 3.
[85.68 → 86.02] Us.
[89.48 → 91.02] And it's a link to our video.
[91.24 → 94.60] Like, I'm going to watch a Linus Tech Tips video
[94.60 → 97.42] to, like, talk about it on the WAN show.
[97.96 → 99.34] That's what we need written articles for.
[99.42 → 99.78] You know what?
[100.38 → 101.00] Oh, my goodness.
[101.02 → 102.22] Have enough of your crap, Anthony.
[102.56 → 103.36] I'm rolling that intro.
[105.42 → 106.40] That's awesome.
[107.28 → 107.94] Oh, man.
[108.56 → 109.38] What a nerd.
[109.38 → 114.04] Because you know he knows what he's doing, you know?
[116.34 → 118.18] You knew what you were doing.
[119.06 → 120.56] Someone asks, is this pre-recorded?
[120.60 → 122.72] Yeah, this is our fourth one of the day so far.
[123.06 → 124.58] Yeah, they're all pre-recorded.
[125.04 → 129.58] It's like, we pre-record them so hard, they're more, like, post-recorded.
[129.82 → 130.42] You know?
[130.42 → 134.12] Like, that's my new, I'm going to be, like, post-Malone.
[134.30 → 135.74] This is post-WAN.
[135.94 → 136.16] You know?
[136.22 → 137.94] It's like the next level WAN.
[138.90 → 140.98] The end times of WAN.
[141.06 → 141.30] All right.
[141.54 → 144.94] Why don't we jump right into our first big topic for the day?
[145.00 → 148.40] And this is already causing big waves in the tech community.
[148.62 → 152.02] There's already a thread on the forum that is,
[152.02 → 157.94] so this was originally posted 12 hours ago by NK1987.
[158.28 → 159.76] It's a good year, 1987.
[160.32 → 164.06] Not quite as good a year as the one before it, but decent, decent year.
[166.14 → 172.84] NK1987 says that Hardware Unbox asked specifically,
[172.84 → 176.86] and AMD seemed to have replied that all future EG ESA code for Zen 3
[176.86 → 181.70] will not support anything but 5XX series motherboards.
[182.08 → 187.26] This doesn't seem to be like in the past when vendors have added support for A320 boards,
[187.72 → 193.52] but more like when AMD updated the EG ESA to lock out PCI Express 4 on X470 boards.
[193.96 → 196.90] So there is a huge mixture of reaction,
[196.90 → 199.78] all the way from people expressing their frustration
[199.78 → 203.62] to people defending AMD's position here.
[203.94 → 208.04] Let's go ahead and give you guys sort of the very short version of the notes here.
[208.22 → 213.98] So Zen 3 is the upcoming AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors.
[214.20 → 219.84] That is, the desktop ones, 4000 series processors on mobile are in fact Zen 2.
[220.42 → 221.20] Confused yet?
[221.42 → 222.48] I don't blame you.
[223.24 → 224.22] Hey, look at that.
[224.28 → 225.78] We've got a compatibility matrix.
[226.00 → 226.24] Wow.
[226.74 → 227.84] Wonderful work, Luke.
[227.84 → 231.30] It's kind of cut off, but actually sort of may be useful.
[232.56 → 233.42] You know what?
[233.52 → 233.66] Yeah.
[233.74 → 234.22] Oh, wow.
[234.66 → 235.80] Oh, wow.
[235.94 → 236.80] That's spectacular.
[237.42 → 238.16] You know what?
[238.22 → 239.02] It's great.
[239.18 → 239.64] You know what?
[239.66 → 240.94] You try hard, and I love it.
[241.28 → 242.32] So Zen 3.
[242.52 → 247.38] Zen 3 is AMD's upcoming architecture that we're going to find in their desktop 4000 series processors.
[247.38 → 255.20] And it sounds, at least from AMD's hints and teasing, like it is going to be a very significant upgrade.
[255.20 → 274.66] Like people are expecting this to be the one where they go from being really competitive with Intel's CPU offerings, but at very compelling prices and with a core count advantage where if you happen to, you know, have a workload that takes advantage of more cores, then it'll be more performant.
[274.66 → 277.64] But if you're a raw gamer, you're probably better off sticking with Intel.
[277.64 → 281.30] Well, we're going to go from that situation to that.
[281.50 → 291.40] You know, the feeling we're getting is AMD leapfrogging Intel significantly where across the board they are going to be the performance leader.
[291.40 → 302.20] And so there's a lot of people out there with AMD motherboards based on AMD's guidance so far and based on their attitude so far towards.
[302.50 → 303.18] Oh, wow.
[303.26 → 304.76] I'm accidentally streaming at 60 FPS.
[304.92 → 305.42] Well, there you go.
[305.48 → 313.32] I had meant to set it to 30 based on AMD's attitude so far towards backwards and forwards compatibility between their motherboard chipsets and their CPUs.
[314.08 → 319.30] There's people out there that are sitting there with AMD motherboards like, yeah, I'm going to upgrade to I'm going to upgrade to Zen 3.
[319.48 → 320.72] I'm going Ry zen 4000 series.
[320.72 → 323.92] As soon as this thing drops, boom, you will not.
[324.56 → 332.76] So it looks like Zen 3 will only be supported on B550 and X560 or X570, excuse me,
[332.82 → 343.58] which means that unless you bought a new motherboard to go with your Zen 2 Ry zen 3000 series, so third gen processor,
[343.86 → 346.86] you are going to be plum out of luck.
[346.86 → 350.70] The farthest you're going to be able to go is Ry zen 3.
[350.70 → 351.70] Ry zen 3.
[351.70 → 353.50] People seem to be pretty annoyed.
[353.50 → 359.42] But in fairness to AMD, let's have a look at how long AM4 has been going strong.
[359.50 → 363.86] It was announced in 2016, delivered in early 2017.
[364.60 → 369.84] And they are actually still releasing processors for this platform.
[369.84 → 375.90] And as long as your older motherboard did get a BIOS update from the manufacturer to support these new chips,
[375.90 → 382.00] there are people out there running very early boards with very new CPUs.
[382.00 → 389.78] And what's really cool about having that option is that it means that if you are not the kind of person who has a ton of money,
[389.86 → 395.72] all right, you bought a board back over three years ago, three and a half years ago, you bought a motherboard.
[395.90 → 397.40] You said, look, I'm betting on AMD.
[397.40 → 402.28] And you would have gotten, you know, what was like a good chip back then, you know,
[402.34 → 405.76] maybe you picked yourself up a Ry zen, a Ry zen 1600.
[406.12 → 406.42] All right.
[406.52 → 410.00] So let's have a look at why am I in French by default here?
[410.78 → 411.18] All right.
[411.26 → 414.00] So the Ry zen 5 1600 processors.
[414.20 → 415.32] Here are the specifications.
[415.56 → 416.32] I'm going to pull this up.
[416.38 → 417.70] I can't show it to you guys, but whatever.
[418.06 → 419.06] It's got six cores.
[419.16 → 419.48] All right.
[419.82 → 422.24] Maximum boost frequency up to 3.6 gigahertz.
[422.24 → 425.32] It had like a decent, oh, wow.
[425.40 → 427.22] You've got, there's two Linuss now.
[427.42 → 427.82] Thanks, Luke.
[428.30 → 428.72] Okay.
[428.80 → 430.44] So that's, you know, decent boost frequency.
[430.60 → 434.50] You had decent IPC, base frequency 3.2, and it had 12 threads.
[434.60 → 434.72] Okay.
[434.74 → 436.10] That was, that was a great value.
[436.50 → 445.38] But Zen 2 is so much faster that if you were to run out and go on Newegg.com and let's,
[445.48 → 445.96] let's have a look.
[445.96 → 447.56] Ry zen 2600.
[447.56 → 457.36] For $168, you could move to six cores of 3.4 gigahertz base, 3.9 gigahertz boost, much
[457.36 → 458.30] faster IPC.
[458.40 → 461.04] Like this is a way better processor for 168 bucks.
[461.12 → 463.46] Plus you can probably flip your 1600X.
[463.96 → 464.12] Okay.
[464.24 → 465.84] So ebay.com here, suckers.
[465.92 → 466.64] Let's have a look.
[467.28 → 468.64] So Ry zen 1600.
[469.12 → 472.74] Oh, did I say, sorry, 1600, non 1600, 1600 non X.
[472.74 → 473.38] Okay.
[473.46 → 479.02] So that thing is still worth, looks like about a hundred bucks one bay.
[479.24 → 479.54] All right.
[479.62 → 480.92] Anywhere from a hundred to $120.
[481.42 → 488.40] So over a span of three and a half years, you could have gone from what was pretty competitive
[488.40 → 496.58] back then to like cutting edge now for the difference between these, you know, 200 bucks
[496.58 → 497.00] or whatever.
[497.00 → 502.52] That's looking pretty good to me for, for a CPU upgrade path.
[503.26 → 506.80] And this is like, I know, I know he's, he's mentioned this a couple of times, but this
[506.80 → 512.30] has actually been a really long amount of time of compatibility, and they have already held
[512.30 → 517.16] back certain features due to trying to keep this platform going for a longer period of
[517.16 → 517.46] time.
[518.12 → 520.14] So the, oh yeah, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
[520.38 → 520.82] No, no, hit me.
[520.86 → 525.24] So the like super enthusiasts should kind of want this to a certain degree anyway.
[525.24 → 532.74] With that said, I want to play, I want to play devil's advocate to myself here and say,
[532.94 → 540.84] um, compared to what Intel does is AMD really out ahead by that much?
[540.92 → 544.24] Because that's Intel's, uh, that's Intel's game, right?
[544.42 → 550.36] So every, every motherboard, every new motherboard chipset launches with a new CPU and then you
[550.36 → 551.92] get like one CPU upgrade.
[551.92 → 555.68] There was actually one case where we got, uh, where we got two.
[555.86 → 557.84] It was the, uh, what was it?
[557.98 → 560.16] Devil's Canyon refresh or something like that.
[560.46 → 567.92] So where, uh, you had the 3770K, the 4770K, and then the 4790K was like sort of, sort
[567.92 → 569.00] of an upgrade for it.
[569.04 → 572.44] But it realistically, it was just like a tweaked 4770K.
[572.90 → 578.30] But if you kind of go and look back at it, okay, we got Zen, we got Zen plus, which was
[578.30 → 580.42] a bigger tweak than Devil's Canyon for sure.
[580.60 → 582.68] And then we got Zen 2 on those motherboards.
[582.76 → 587.32] We only really got two full CPU refreshes.
[587.38 → 590.38] We got like two and a half kind of thing.
[590.52 → 592.28] And that is better than Intel.
[592.42 → 596.88] But if you look at their Thread ripper platform, it was the same thing, right?
[596.92 → 600.20] We got a new, we actually got a new socket with the third gen Thread ripper.
[600.20 → 602.78] So they only managed to do two generations on that one.
[603.26 → 611.76] And then we actually, I don't know if we know is, uh, TRX for our STRX4 socket TRX4 is getting,
[611.84 → 613.94] I think, I think it is probably getting another generation.
[614.06 → 615.70] I don't know if that's actually formally confirmed.
[615.70 → 619.20] So don't take, take all of this from up for the ignorant ramblings that it is.
[619.28 → 622.86] But I think there are a couple of things we have to acknowledge here.
[622.96 → 627.64] One is kudos to AMD for making a good effort here.
[627.64 → 631.94] Because one difference is that even though they only managed two and a half,
[632.50 → 634.38] hey, they managed two and a half.
[634.60 → 637.32] And through the work of their board partners, updating their biases,
[637.56 → 642.14] there are people out there who really did get three and a half years worth of upgrades on a motherboard.
[642.50 → 643.18] That's freaking awesome.
[643.80 → 648.78] Number two is that by keeping the same AM4 socket,
[649.40 → 654.18] even though the chipset compatibility is a little bit dicier,
[654.64 → 657.34] they are creating a lot of confusion in their lineup.
[657.34 → 661.50] Something that I have heard cited as a reason that Intel does not do this.
[661.80 → 663.82] They don't want confusion in the lineup.
[663.94 → 667.82] If you buy this, and you buy this, it will work that simple.
[668.32 → 670.22] So AMD has taken that risk.
[670.34 → 673.06] They have taken the risk of creating confusion in their lineup to have
[673.06 → 677.08] as good of intercompatibility as they possibly can.
[677.58 → 680.54] And what's neat is that instead of going,
[680.68 → 682.46] okay, I've got a CPU and a motherboard.
[682.46 → 686.70] And then in two years, they will both be complete dead-end platforms.
[687.18 → 689.32] At least if you were to upgrade,
[689.38 → 692.32] let's say you bought your original motherboard back three and a half years ago,
[692.32 → 697.38] and you were to upgrade your motherboard today in preparation for Zen 3, right?
[697.48 → 700.06] You go get an X570 or a B550 board.
[700.06 → 705.74] Well, now you can have third gen and then probably maybe something else after that.
[705.90 → 710.06] We've got this overlap between the motherboard and CPU compatibility
[710.06 → 712.64] so that at least if you buy two things,
[713.22 → 717.10] the odds of both of them becoming a dead end at the same time is lower.
[717.46 → 720.56] And as an upgraded, as someone who frequently over the years
[720.56 → 722.94] would upgrade my computer piecemeal,
[723.18 → 724.64] that's something that's very appealing to me.
[724.68 → 726.08] You know, I've got a motherboard I already like.
[726.32 → 727.00] I'll grab a new CPU.
[727.00 → 727.58] You know what?
[727.64 → 728.76] I don't need a new CPU today.
[728.84 → 729.84] This is enough performance for me,
[729.90 → 732.04] but I want some new motherboard features that are super sexy.
[732.24 → 733.24] Go get a new motherboard.
[733.70 → 736.78] That's a pretty cool way for an enthusiast to move their system forward.
[737.52 → 739.02] Do you think that's that common these days?
[739.62 → 739.84] No.
[740.74 → 744.90] And that's another one of the big reasons that Intel,
[745.30 → 748.50] that I've heard off the record from, you know,
[749.18 → 751.84] citation needed sources at Intel.
[751.84 → 757.08] That's one of the big reasons that I've heard for them to not really pursue it as hard.
[757.56 → 759.06] So it creates a ton of confusion.
[759.38 → 762.28] It creates a ton of customer angst.
[762.60 → 765.58] Like I experienced it for the first time personally.
[766.42 → 772.68] The BIOS intercompatibility issues with AM4 motherboards that can arise
[772.68 → 774.34] and be very, very frustrating.
[774.34 → 779.48] Like I was building a system last week and I built the whole thing up.
[779.54 → 780.50] I water cooled it.
[780.78 → 784.00] Should have post-tested it before I actually water cooled it.
[784.04 → 787.00] But whatever, you know, you live and learn or you just live one way or the other.
[787.56 → 787.76] Yeah.
[788.04 → 788.40] Okay.
[788.40 → 790.78] I boot the thing up and no post.
[790.88 → 792.12] And there's no indication, right?
[792.16 → 795.64] It's not like it makes a special beep code when you install an incompatible CPU.
[795.86 → 799.58] It is just like the power flicked on for a second and then off and then on and then off.
[799.58 → 803.18] It looked like just kind of standard post-fail, right?
[803.80 → 806.58] And I was like, fortunately, I'm tech-savvy enough
[806.58 → 810.44] and I have access to a warehouse full of CPUs 20 minutes away
[810.44 → 812.52] that I was able to go, oh, you know what?
[812.54 → 814.56] It's probably a BIOS compatibility issue.
[814.66 → 820.02] And I ran over to the warehouse, grabbed a Ry zen 1600 or 2600 or something like that,
[820.10 → 820.66] popped it in there.
[820.80 → 821.04] Yep.
[821.16 → 823.06] Sure enough, it fires right up, flashed the BIOS,
[823.40 → 828.02] put my third gen 3900X back in there, and we're off to the races.
[828.02 → 833.50] But I can see why a company might shy away from that as a user experience
[833.50 → 838.44] because a lot of your brand as a company is built on how people feel
[838.44 → 840.20] when they buy and use your product.
[840.34 → 843.20] And that was not a good user experience.
[843.32 → 844.58] That's the cold, hard truth of it.
[844.82 → 850.94] And I will confess, I did not fully and properly understand the problem
[850.94 → 854.62] with AMD's BIOS intercompatibility problems.
[854.62 → 859.02] So I was using a B450 board with a Ry zen third gen.
[859.22 → 864.98] And my logic based on, you know, the 15 years or whatever I've been into this stuff was,
[865.48 → 869.90] hey, it's been so long since the B450 and Ry zen third gen launches
[869.90 → 873.56] that they should be out of the box compatible by now.
[873.90 → 877.50] I don't have to worry about doing a BIOS update in order to run this chip.
[878.28 → 880.04] That is straight up not how it works.
[880.04 → 883.56] So part of the reason for them dropping the compatibility now
[883.56 → 886.68] and part of the reason that the compatibility is so messy
[886.68 → 892.14] is that the flash chips, so the ROM chips on these motherboards
[892.14 → 896.68] cannot hold enough data to have all the code that they need
[896.68 → 900.38] to be compatible with every CPU that could feasibly be plugged into it.
[900.64 → 905.16] And it's like, oh yeah, that makes so much sense now.
[905.16 → 905.58] Physical limitations.
[905.58 → 906.14] Yeah.
[906.14 → 907.60] These are physical limitations.
[908.56 → 913.12] So we've actually seen compromises be made.
[913.24 → 915.22] So the board that I was using was an AS Rock board.
[915.38 → 918.12] You have to go on AS Rock's website, and it specifically says,
[918.26 → 921.24] download this version of the new BIOS if you're running one of these CPUs.
[921.32 → 922.84] Download this one if you're running these CPUs.
[923.22 → 925.34] That's a bad user experience.
[925.44 → 928.94] I mean, I went through trying to get my grandparents set up with an iPad
[928.94 → 930.78] over the phone last weekend.
[930.78 → 934.48] And obviously, that's a pretty extreme example.
[934.64 → 935.60] It took like four hours.
[937.18 → 938.16] Well, it's like little things.
[938.30 → 940.80] They didn't know their Wi-Fi password because why would they?
[940.86 → 942.58] They don't have any Wi-Fi devices.
[943.18 → 946.42] And then their TELUS, I was like, okay, we need to look at the TELUS box.
[946.50 → 948.72] Well, they have two TELUS boxes stacked on top of each other.
[949.40 → 951.40] So that was a stumbling block.
[951.84 → 956.94] Their iMac is so old that browser support has been dropped
[956.94 → 959.36] from almost every major browser.
[959.36 → 961.14] There's some kind of Firefox clone.
[961.28 → 963.74] It's like Ice Fox or something like that, Arctic Fox,
[964.22 → 965.44] that will still run on it.
[965.48 → 966.64] But they didn't have that installed.
[967.14 → 973.96] So even accessing their router's UI to log in as an admin,
[974.20 → 976.00] the login button was just not there.
[976.38 → 978.80] So I'm like pulling my grandpa over the phone.
[978.90 → 980.80] I'm like, just click the login button.
[980.86 → 981.86] He's like, there's no login button.
[981.92 → 985.36] I'm like, no, I'm looking at like screenshots on Google
[985.36 → 986.90] of like where the login button is.
[986.90 → 989.62] Everything else about this page that you're describing to me is right.
[990.06 → 990.96] Click the login button.
[991.02 → 992.24] He's like, it's not there.
[993.80 → 995.80] Random pro tip I would recommend.
[997.32 → 1000.44] And I've used this when trying to help my grandpa with something.
[1000.78 → 1002.94] Set it up with TeamViewer before you send it to him.
[1004.94 → 1007.04] If you can get them to get TeamViewer going,
[1007.38 → 1009.76] which is potentially a whole different issue.
[1009.86 → 1011.04] Yeah, I couldn't even get them on Wi-Fi.
[1011.04 → 1016.32] This is actually how I got them to the point of being able to get TeamViewer working.
[1016.54 → 1016.70] Yeah.
[1017.04 → 1020.28] Which is I could, you can usually get them to engage in a video call.
[1021.70 → 1022.98] I mean, I didn't have.
[1023.20 → 1024.34] Get on Wi-Fi, so.
[1025.02 → 1025.88] But their phone?
[1026.20 → 1026.54] They didn't have a phone on Wi-Fi?
[1026.54 → 1027.28] They don't have a cell phone.
[1030.28 → 1030.68] Yeah.
[1030.88 → 1031.16] No, no.
[1031.24 → 1031.82] This was like.
[1031.82 → 1032.10] They were screwed.
[1032.38 → 1032.60] Yeah.
[1032.60 → 1035.32] I had to put on a mask and gloves and just go there.
[1036.20 → 1038.32] And the stupid thing is that once I got there,
[1038.40 → 1042.76] it legitimately wasn't simple because of the browser compatibility issues.
[1042.86 → 1046.54] They had no other web browser capable device in the building
[1046.54 → 1049.78] that was able to go in and reconfigure the password for their Wi-Fi
[1049.78 → 1052.24] that they had forgotten.
[1052.62 → 1054.66] So it's like, okay, great.
[1055.32 → 1062.04] And the UI for that TELUS combination Wi-Fi modem router thing is so bad.
[1062.04 → 1064.84] So when you change something and like change something else,
[1064.88 → 1065.42] then click save.
[1065.52 → 1066.98] The first thing you change doesn't change.
[1067.06 → 1068.78] Apparently you just have to do one field at a time.
[1069.00 → 1071.26] At least an Arctic Fox, which is what I was using, right?
[1071.46 → 1071.58] So.
[1071.76 → 1072.92] Were you using Water Fox?
[1073.26 → 1074.34] No, Arctic Fox.
[1074.98 → 1075.54] Oh, interesting.
[1076.66 → 1076.86] Yeah.
[1076.86 → 1079.28] It's like specifically for old IMAX or something.
[1081.42 → 1081.82] Fox.
[1081.98 → 1082.20] Wow.
[1082.48 → 1083.02] Yeah, I know.
[1083.08 → 1083.24] Right.
[1083.64 → 1085.14] Anyway, what were we talking about?
[1085.36 → 1085.98] What were we talking about?
[1086.76 → 1087.30] Oh, yeah.
[1087.40 → 1087.60] Right.
[1087.62 → 1088.92] It's a bad user experience.
[1088.92 → 1091.50] So obviously that's a bit of an extreme example,
[1091.50 → 1092.90] but not everyone is me.
[1093.26 → 1096.22] And if I am frustrated by the out-of-the-box experience,
[1096.38 → 1097.92] I guarantee you the average,
[1098.08 → 1101.00] like me when I was, you know, 15 years old,
[1101.06 → 1102.16] buying my first computer,
[1102.72 → 1105.24] realizing that I have to go, what, like find a friend.
[1105.30 → 1106.06] I didn't have any friends.
[1106.42 → 1110.28] Go find a friend who has a CPU that's compatible with my motherboard.
[1110.50 → 1113.52] Convince them to let me rip the CPU out of their computer
[1113.52 → 1114.26] and put it in there.
[1114.26 → 1118.18] Or like hope that the store has a fast and convenient policy.
[1118.18 → 1118.72] Be the service centre.
[1118.90 → 1119.04] Yeah.
[1119.14 → 1119.32] Right?
[1119.46 → 1119.64] Yeah.
[1120.50 → 1122.94] And now I have to like to go and pay for that or not.
[1123.04 → 1124.32] I know some places do it for free.
[1124.40 → 1126.12] It's just not a great user experience.
[1126.22 → 1128.30] So I see it from both sides.
[1128.50 → 1130.64] I see the AMD community feeling a little betrayed,
[1130.64 → 1134.08] but I also see AMD making an earnest effort
[1134.08 → 1135.20] to maintain this compatibility,
[1135.20 → 1137.70] even to the detriment of their user experience.
[1137.70 → 1141.02] And I see why they might want to clean this up moving forward.
[1141.20 → 1141.80] That's my take.
[1142.56 → 1142.96] Yeah.
[1143.12 → 1145.20] I guess I understand that.
[1145.28 → 1148.72] I think I'm definitely not more on the side
[1148.72 → 1150.78] of the AMD community feeling betrayed
[1150.78 → 1153.78] because like if they kept this going,
[1153.88 → 1155.44] it would just get worse and worse.
[1155.72 → 1156.20] Yes.
[1156.30 → 1159.50] And like, I don't, that's not, that's not a good solution.
[1159.62 → 1159.72] Yeah.
[1159.84 → 1162.14] And you're, I think you're like a lot of people
[1162.14 → 1164.40] where by the time you upgrade your CPU,
[1165.36 → 1167.06] it's probably time to upgrade.
[1167.06 → 1168.72] Like when you upgrade your system,
[1168.80 → 1171.48] you're rocking a 5960X, if I recall correctly.
[1171.58 → 1171.92] Is that right?
[1172.26 → 1172.42] Yep.
[1172.60 → 1172.80] Yeah.
[1172.88 → 1177.36] So, you know, eight cores of a Haswell ain't that fast these days.
[1177.46 → 1178.42] Not at those clock speeds.
[1179.30 → 1182.26] By the time you're upgrading your CPU, you know what?
[1182.34 → 1184.22] Hey, you might also want some new high speed.
[1184.52 → 1188.12] Actually, you might want some new higher bandwidth USB ports.
[1189.36 → 1189.66] Yeah.
[1190.20 → 1190.58] Yeah.
[1190.68 → 1192.22] So we had an issue right before the call.
[1192.32 → 1193.40] Why don't you explain what happened?
[1194.72 → 1195.86] I've been plugging it.
[1195.86 → 1199.16] So I use a camcorder for this now because yay upgrades.
[1199.42 → 1203.08] And I've been plugging my AVID 4K capture card
[1203.08 → 1206.12] into the same USB plug every time.
[1206.12 → 1207.44] And it's been working every time.
[1207.96 → 1211.12] But I changed how I had my VR setup done.
[1211.60 → 1214.64] And I moved where it was plugged in via USB.
[1215.10 → 1217.50] So that controller had more bandwidth going through it.
[1217.56 → 1219.74] So the camera would just like stop working constantly.
[1220.14 → 1220.26] Yeah.
[1220.70 → 1221.52] Very frustrating.
[1221.52 → 1224.94] I thought that I just needed to plug it in somewhere else, and it solved all the problems
[1224.94 → 1225.36] immediately.
[1225.64 → 1225.84] Yeah.
[1226.50 → 1227.06] So, yeah.
[1227.10 → 1227.84] No, that would be great.
[1228.18 → 1231.78] I'm probably waiting for...
[1231.78 → 1239.58] Ry zen 3rd Gen to be cheap in the Linus Media Group store after 4th Gen comes out.
[1239.66 → 1240.94] That's what I would expect you to do.
[1241.36 → 1242.00] Pretty much.
[1242.00 → 1242.24] Yeah.
[1242.30 → 1243.38] You're probably going to go...
[1243.38 → 1244.94] You're probably going to go 3,900X.
[1245.18 → 1248.36] You know, like not full baller tier because I don't think you need 16 cores.
[1248.98 → 1249.06] No.
[1249.06 → 1251.78] You don't want to pay an extra like, you know, $300 for that or whatever.
[1252.14 → 1252.26] Yeah.
[1252.32 → 1253.00] See, I'm on to you.
[1253.08 → 1253.90] I know what you're about.
[1254.10 → 1254.22] Yeah.
[1254.36 → 1256.80] What do you think I'm planning on graphics side?
[1257.20 → 1258.18] Oh, graphics side?
[1258.66 → 1260.46] Well, you're definitely not going SLI again.
[1260.52 → 1261.84] I know that for a fact.
[1262.30 → 1262.86] Not a chance.
[1262.98 → 1265.38] That has been such a bad experience for you.
[1265.38 → 1267.20] You know what?
[1267.28 → 1271.38] I think the timing is going to be perfect for like...
[1272.26 → 1276.98] The rumours are already starting to swirl around an upcoming RTX refresh.
[1277.54 → 1283.28] I think that NVIDIA is very unlikely to make dramatic changes to the NV ENC encoder,
[1283.74 → 1289.10] which I think is the only reason that you could be persuaded to go RTX 3000 series.
[1289.10 → 1300.48] So my guess is you're going to try and sweet talk me into a 2080 Ti for a song right when RTX 3000 series launches.
[1300.72 → 1301.82] That's your move.
[1301.98 → 1302.52] That's got to be your move.
[1302.52 → 1303.08] He mailed it.
[1303.28 → 1305.90] Literally every part of the plan.
[1307.40 → 1307.96] Yeah.
[1308.14 → 1308.38] Yeah.
[1308.42 → 1308.92] That's it.
[1309.18 → 1309.82] That was it.
[1312.70 → 1318.58] I'm really excited for upgrading to the new NV ENC encoding stuff on the 2000 series.
[1318.58 → 1320.50] And RTX voice looks awesome.
[1320.84 → 1321.02] Yeah.
[1321.10 → 1322.32] And that sounds great.
[1322.62 → 1322.92] Yeah.
[1323.18 → 1323.44] Yeah.
[1323.50 → 1323.92] All right.
[1324.02 → 1324.88] I know.
[1325.02 → 1325.40] I know.
[1325.62 → 1326.58] I know, Luke.
[1327.36 → 1329.24] Why don't we talk about Apple's new MacBook?
[1329.90 → 1330.96] This is actually...
[1330.96 → 1331.94] This is pretty good news.
[1332.04 → 1334.68] So Apple launches a new 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[1334.80 → 1335.78] We've got it on order.
[1336.02 → 1343.10] It's featuring Intel's Ice Lake CPUs and the new old scissor-style keyboard.
[1343.88 → 1347.30] Externally, not much has changed, but it's a bit thicker and 30 grams heavier.
[1347.30 → 1349.12] Apple, for better...
[1349.12 → 1352.16] No, not because they're actually listening, but maybe it's by accident.
[1352.32 → 1357.82] Apple seems to be listening to me more than not listening to me over the last couple of years.
[1358.54 → 1361.64] Like, they have done a lot of stuff that has annoyed me,
[1361.74 → 1365.28] but they've also done a lot of stuff that I think is super cool over the last few years,
[1365.66 → 1368.72] including 10 gigabit networking on the Mac Mini.
[1369.18 → 1369.80] That's sick.
[1369.80 → 1374.60] So the fact that every desktop Mac now features 10 gig networking, at least as an option.
[1375.00 → 1375.38] Oh, wait.
[1375.48 → 1376.74] No, I don't think the iMac does.
[1376.90 → 1384.54] The iMac Pro, the Mac Pro, and the Mac Mini, though, all at least have 10 gig networking as an option.
[1385.30 → 1387.60] Their cooling has gotten better.
[1388.00 → 1389.24] They've improved their keyboard.
[1389.86 → 1391.14] Like, dang!
[1391.60 → 1392.60] You know, dang, Apple!
[1392.60 → 1398.58] So, new Ice Lake processor, the high-performance version, sports a 2.3 gig base, 4.1 turbo.
[1399.16 → 1403.08] That is a quad-core, if I recall correctly.
[1403.54 → 1404.60] No, that should be a 6-core.
[1405.78 → 1406.74] Let me just...
[1406.74 → 1409.58] I'm going to double-check, so I don't say anything stupid, right?
[1409.84 → 1410.00] You know?
[1410.44 → 1412.60] That is four CPU cores.
[1412.94 → 1419.50] Four cores, and these are probably, like, U-class.
[1419.50 → 1423.02] Yeah, so they haven't changed the battery capacity.
[1423.14 → 1428.90] It's still about 58-watt hours, so these are probably kind of U-class-is CPUs.
[1428.98 → 1434.66] They're using Intel Iris Plus graphics, and dang, we've gone to LPDDR4X.
[1434.70 → 1438.16] That is going to be a nice little improvement to system snappiness.
[1438.88 → 1441.30] Also, we've got four Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[1442.18 → 1442.94] Pretty sweet.
[1443.52 → 1445.80] So that was already present on the higher-end one.
[1445.92 → 1446.90] That's present here.
[1447.02 → 1448.30] Okay, what else is interesting?
[1448.30 → 1450.52] Rated 10 hours of battery life.
[1450.60 → 1455.68] So the big upgrades, really, are that we're going to Ice Lake, and that we've got LPDDR4X memory.
[1456.02 → 1457.60] That took a long time to come around.
[1457.74 → 1460.50] I mean, DDR5 is already on the horizon.
[1460.96 → 1463.68] So we ordered what we think is kind of a sensible spec here.
[1463.74 → 1467.36] I don't think we took the top-spec CPU, and I think we went with...
[1467.36 → 1469.84] I think Anthony talked me into a 1-terabyte drive.
[1469.94 → 1471.22] He was like, well, boot camp, right?
[1471.30 → 1473.60] And I'm like, oh, yeah, I guess that's a fair point, isn't it?
[1474.02 → 1474.74] You don't want less than like...
[1474.74 → 1475.84] Are you guys going to use it?
[1475.84 → 1481.46] He wants to talk about it as a use case, and I guess he could have just...
[1482.56 → 1483.80] Talked about it as a use case?
[1483.80 → 1486.36] Yeah, why did I spend another $200 on a MacBook?
[1488.06 → 1489.74] Meet me around for your cheap decisions.
[1490.16 → 1490.46] Dang it.
[1491.16 → 1491.92] So I don't know.
[1492.02 → 1493.72] I didn't hear you mention this.
[1493.76 → 1494.42] You might have mentioned this.
[1494.46 → 1494.64] Sorry.
[1495.06 → 1497.40] The lower-end models have two Thunderbolt ports.
[1497.82 → 1498.74] The higher-end models have four.
[1499.08 → 1499.98] Of the new ones?
[1500.60 → 1500.82] Yeah.
[1500.82 → 1501.62] Oh, okay.
[1501.74 → 1503.58] So basically, that's the same as before then.
[1503.68 → 1507.52] Well, the lower-end Coffee Lake models, but they're still new models.
[1509.32 → 1511.46] Oh, why does Apple do this?
[1512.34 → 1512.74] Yeah.
[1513.06 → 1514.42] So they're muddying the waters.
[1514.54 → 1514.88] I see.
[1515.06 → 1517.20] So only the new high-end ones get Ice Lake.
[1517.32 → 1518.44] I mean, that's...
[1518.44 → 1522.74] Man, Intel has had such 10-nanometer struggles.
[1522.86 → 1523.86] So Ice Lake is 10 nanometers.
[1523.86 → 1524.94] Oh, no, that's wrong.
[1525.02 → 1527.28] It's just showing up weird on this chart.
[1527.58 → 1528.16] Oh, okay.
[1528.36 → 1528.78] My bad.
[1529.10 → 1529.90] Okay, never mind.
[1530.00 → 1530.28] You know what?
[1530.30 → 1531.50] Why don't we just go to apple.com?
[1532.00 → 1533.06] I don't do this often.
[1533.12 → 1533.78] I'm going to treat myself.
[1534.52 → 1536.42] This is a very expensive website, ladies and gentlemen.
[1536.52 → 1538.58] It is an extremely expensive website.
[1539.08 → 1539.76] That is true.
[1540.22 → 1540.60] All right.
[1542.32 → 1544.40] New MacBook Pro 13-inch.
[1544.54 → 1545.22] Here we are.
[1545.72 → 1549.62] Up to 10th generation processors with up to 80% faster graphics performance.
[1549.62 → 1555.06] Wow, that is such a sideways swipe at Intel right there.
[1555.60 → 1557.00] Yep, they're 10th gen, all right.
[1557.00 → 1562.36] And yep, up to faster graphics, but they sure ain't faster in any other meaningful way.
[1562.58 → 1563.40] Hey, got them.
[1564.84 → 1566.18] Okay, so we got our...
[1567.06 → 1567.44] Yikes.
[1567.64 → 1569.56] Wow, this is their buy page.
[1569.82 → 1572.26] This configuration page is actually terrible.
[1572.76 → 1573.30] Hold on a second.
[1573.36 → 1575.08] I'm going to screen share you guys on this for a second.
[1575.18 → 1578.52] I really do not like this at all.
[1580.02 → 1580.42] Chrome.
[1580.42 → 1583.00] Yeah, there you go.
[1583.20 → 1583.52] All right.
[1584.00 → 1584.52] There we go.
[1584.60 → 1584.94] Let's here.
[1585.02 → 1586.80] Let's pull this up here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1587.82 → 1588.24] Look at this.
[1588.32 → 1588.94] Fourth model.
[1589.12 → 1589.80] What am I even...
[1589.80 → 1590.86] What am I looking at?
[1590.94 → 1592.72] I can't click on any of this.
[1592.86 → 1593.60] I can't...
[1593.60 → 1594.54] What the heck?
[1595.32 → 1598.82] I think your screen is not right.
[1599.34 → 1600.36] My screen is not right?
[1600.48 → 1601.14] In what sense?
[1601.20 → 1602.82] Did you select one of the models already?
[1603.26 → 1603.60] No.
[1603.86 → 1605.12] I just clicked tech specs.
[1605.60 → 1606.22] 13 inch.
[1606.70 → 1606.94] Look.
[1607.42 → 1607.92] So Mac.
[1608.26 → 1609.06] MacBook Pro.
[1609.90 → 1610.42] Tech specs.
[1612.40 → 1613.44] This is like stupid.
[1613.62 → 1614.90] Like, what does this correspond to?
[1615.90 → 1616.24] Oh.
[1616.36 → 1617.52] Like, how sloppy is that?
[1617.76 → 1619.80] These look like buttons, but I can't click them.
[1620.46 → 1621.04] So we've just got...
[1621.04 → 1622.08] That's not the configurator thing, though.
[1622.12 → 1625.32] That's just the random tech specs of those...
[1625.32 → 1626.56] That range of laptops.
[1626.68 → 1627.42] Right, but like...
[1628.86 → 1629.22] What?
[1629.44 → 1629.98] I hear you.
[1630.16 → 1631.22] I hear you for sure.
[1631.70 → 1633.50] Why can't they just say?
[1634.48 → 1636.04] Core i5...
[1636.04 → 1636.50] Whatever.
[1637.18 → 1641.10] Why do they do this their own fancy special way?
[1641.40 → 1643.96] They do if you go to, like, buy it.
[1644.26 → 1652.80] 1.4 gigahertz quad-core eighth generation Intel Core i5, comma, turboboost up to 3.9 gigahertz, comma, with 128 megabytes of ED RAM.
[1653.82 → 1663.42] How did they manage to make Intel's naming scheme, which is already abominable, even more confusing, configurable to this?
[1664.24 → 1665.26] Uh, okay.
[1666.36 → 1667.50] Eight generation quad-core...
[1667.50 → 1667.96] Yeah, okay.
[1667.96 → 1669.28] I guess they just don't use it.
[1670.18 → 1671.96] It's kind of funny, actually, in a way.
[1672.16 → 1672.46] Wow.
[1672.56 → 1672.84] All right.
[1672.90 → 1673.88] So the buy page.
[1674.16 → 1676.42] See, this is much easier to understand.
[1676.54 → 1677.84] The buy page is a little better.
[1677.84 → 1678.96] It's still...
[1678.96 → 1682.58] I mean, they still don't say the actual model name of the processor and stuff.
[1682.70 → 1682.88] Yeah.
[1683.00 → 1684.28] But, like, it's...
[1684.28 → 1685.70] The specs are laid out better.
[1685.70 → 1686.22] So there you go.
[1686.26 → 1694.18] We've got a bunch of new models, but anything but the top-end one is not really new in any sort of meaningful sense of the word.
[1694.18 → 1694.58] Yeah.
[1694.82 → 1698.68] Because it's still Coffee Lake, and it's still LPDDR3.
[1699.44 → 1709.40] That was the part I was confused about, but I looked it up, and, like, this page of MacBook Pros, choose your new MacBook Pros, goes all the way back to 2018.
[1710.02 → 1710.36] Right.
[1711.24 → 1712.20] So, like...
[1712.20 → 1715.48] Do they at least have the better keyboard, though?
[1716.44 → 1717.42] Backlit Magic Keyboard.
[1717.50 → 1717.70] Yes.
[1717.78 → 1719.22] So they've at least got a better keyboard.
[1719.48 → 1720.04] So that's good.
[1721.16 → 1721.42] Cool.
[1721.52 → 1721.84] All right.
[1722.22 → 1724.18] What else we got for the WAN Show today?
[1725.18 → 1726.84] Oh, we should talk about our sponsors.
[1727.30 → 1728.36] Sponsors for the WAN Show.
[1729.04 → 1729.78] All right.
[1729.78 → 1732.84] The WAN Show today is brought to you by Displayed.
[1734.22 → 1736.02] What else do I need to say about it?
[1736.10 → 1739.54] There are metal prints that you hang on your wall, but you don't have to hang them.
[1739.62 → 1740.26] They're magnetic.
[1740.82 → 1744.58] So you put this, like, magnet thing on your wall, and then you just slap your Displayed on there.
[1744.64 → 1745.80] It's super easy to mount.
[1745.88 → 1746.86] You don't need any power tools.
[1747.14 → 1752.34] And they've got over 800,000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles and influences.
[1752.66 → 1754.50] With their easy magnetic mounting...
[1754.50 → 1755.32] Oh, I already had that.
[1755.36 → 1758.34] They plant one tree for every Displayed purchased, and...
[1758.34 → 1758.90] This is cool.
[1758.90 → 1762.70] We even have our very own lineup of Displayed.
[1763.06 → 1769.62] So if you head over to displayed.com slash Linus Tech Tips slash Portraits, you can actually see...
[1769.62 → 1772.96] I'm just going to go like that.
[1773.10 → 1773.48] Boom!
[1773.54 → 1774.04] Look at that!
[1775.30 → 1779.52] It's that Linus guy and that Dennis guy and Alex and James.
[1779.90 → 1780.58] And hey, look.
[1780.78 → 1781.86] Hey, we got a cartoon of Luke.
[1782.24 → 1783.44] We got cartoon Luke in there.
[1783.68 → 1784.22] That's pretty good.
[1784.22 → 1784.40] Yay!
[1784.70 → 1785.34] That's pretty good.
[1785.92 → 1786.32] All right.
[1786.38 → 1787.06] That is pretty good.
[1787.06 → 1790.38] This is a little bit more awkward to do now than it used to be.
[1790.48 → 1795.60] So use offer code LTT to save 15% at leg.GG slash Displate when.
[1796.30 → 1799.10] The show is also brought to you by Private Internet Access.
[1799.44 → 1801.10] You want your internet access to be private?
[1801.54 → 1804.48] Well, then maybe you should get private internet access, NumPy.
[1805.02 → 1805.36] All right?
[1805.66 → 1807.38] What's in your online security toolkit?
[1807.74 → 1811.02] Adding a VPN lets you mask your IP and encrypt traffic to and from your devices.
[1811.02 → 1814.82] PIA has reliable service with over 3,300 servers in 30 countries.
[1815.28 → 1817.12] They now feature WireGuard, which is pretty sweet.
[1817.42 → 1821.48] And they have no bandwidth caps, so you can download anything you want using PIA,
[1821.66 → 1825.20] and no one will see what you are downloading as long as you actually have it enabled
[1825.20 → 1828.98] and as long as you use their kill switch so that nothing can leak out.
[1829.42 → 1833.38] You can connect up to five devices at once with a single account with clients for Windows,
[1833.50 → 1835.30] macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.
[1835.30 → 1838.82] And you can check them out at leg.GG slash PIA when.
[1839.36 → 1841.20] The show is also brought to you by XSplit.
[1841.86 → 1846.34] XSplit's Cam allows you to remove and replace your background without a green screen.
[1846.48 → 1850.34] It uses AI to automatically know the difference between you and the background
[1850.34 → 1853.98] without any need for complicated lighting setups or a fancy camera.
[1854.08 → 1855.02] It'll even work with your webcam.
[1855.52 → 1857.56] You can customize the background to anything you want,
[1857.70 → 1860.14] and Cam works with other XSplit broadcast tools,
[1860.14 → 1865.54] but also just other tools like Slack, Hangout, Skype, and more.
[1865.98 → 1869.32] In fact, this is like the funniest thing to me.
[1869.66 → 1871.14] If you go on XSplit's...
[1871.14 → 1875.66] Why are all of my Google searches in French right now?
[1876.12 → 1879.08] I am... I'm finding this... I'm finding this very frustrating.
[1879.56 → 1882.16] Yeah, if you go on XSplit's website,
[1882.64 → 1885.26] slash Cam works with...
[1885.26 → 1888.88] They've got Logitech Capture in there, OBS.
[1889.00 → 1890.52] They've got OBS right on the page.
[1891.18 → 1892.20] So it's pretty sick.
[1892.38 → 1892.92] Slack, Zoom.
[1894.26 → 1896.42] Basically, all the things that you're using right now
[1896.42 → 1899.40] to communicate with your school or your work
[1899.40 → 1901.52] if you're working remotely, etc.
[1902.06 → 1904.02] If you're streaming all the software you're using.
[1904.56 → 1908.74] They offer 24-7 support, and it costs $3.95 USD per month.
[1908.96 → 1911.36] Or, this is nice, everyone should do this.
[1911.52 → 1913.42] They offer a lifetime license for $49.95.
[1913.42 → 1916.20] Use offer code Linus Tech Tips to save 10%.
[1916.20 → 1918.14] I just... Oh, yeah.
[1918.22 → 1920.14] So at the link in the video description.
[1921.42 → 1923.12] I like that a lot.
[1923.82 → 1926.28] I'm not a huge fan of software as a service.
[1926.42 → 1928.96] We did a video recently about how upset I was
[1928.96 → 1930.48] at how much I pay Adobe,
[1930.78 → 1932.74] which really is about $10,000 a year
[1932.74 → 1934.76] between all the editors and the other creative types
[1934.76 → 1936.42] because almost everyone in the company
[1936.42 → 1939.34] uses more than just one thing in the suite.
[1939.54 → 1941.34] And once you use more than one,
[1941.34 → 1943.80] like, as soon as you buy two individual tools,
[1943.88 → 1946.28] it costs nearly as much as the entire creative suite.
[1946.36 → 1948.34] And obviously, they've structured it that way on purpose.
[1948.76 → 1950.56] Otherwise, most people, like,
[1950.74 → 1952.98] don't use Adobe Prelude, for example,
[1953.56 → 1956.32] and would be happy to just not pay for it.
[1956.36 → 1957.02] That would be great.
[1959.02 → 1961.42] But anyway, I talked about how frustrated I was
[1961.42 → 1963.64] paying so much for software as a service
[1963.64 → 1966.46] and how I would rather just have the option.
[1966.46 → 1969.08] If I like it exactly the way it is today
[1969.08 → 1971.12] and I don't expect it to change at all
[1971.12 → 1974.06] to just plonk down my money one time,
[1974.12 → 1975.64] and I expect it to be a pretty high fee
[1975.64 → 1976.78] because that's how that works,
[1977.34 → 1978.60] to just own it forever.
[1978.84 → 1980.06] I like that as an option.
[1980.38 → 1982.36] Kaine has sort of a similar approach.
[1982.84 → 1985.08] With them, you can pay on an ongoing basis
[1985.08 → 1987.10] and you get, like, kind of support contract
[1987.10 → 1988.36] built into that effectively.
[1988.84 → 1989.88] And then if you stop paying,
[1990.00 → 1991.74] you still get to keep the software as it is.
[1991.80 → 1993.16] I think you just don't get support on it.
[1993.16 → 1996.34] Like, yeah, that's a good, it's a good compromise
[1996.34 → 1998.94] because not everybody wants that.
[2001.20 → 2003.16] Xbox Series X gameplay reveal
[2003.16 → 2004.86] was temporarily taken down
[2004.86 → 2006.54] amidst backlash over the lack of gameplay.
[2006.66 → 2007.66] I didn't watch it.
[2007.98 → 2008.58] Tell me about it.
[2008.58 → 2010.34] This is actually wild.
[2011.68 → 2015.44] This, like, I opened it up
[2015.44 → 2017.58] and I watched the whole thing vaguely
[2017.58 → 2019.24] on a side monitor while I was doing other stuff.
[2019.66 → 2021.18] And what blew my mind about it
[2021.18 → 2022.94] was watching the intro,
[2023.28 → 2024.34] I was like, okay,
[2024.80 → 2027.14] they have, like, world premiere
[2027.14 → 2031.40] that looks like someone took some vague Xbox colours
[2031.40 → 2033.12] for a background and then word art
[2033.12 → 2034.68] and just wrote world premiere.
[2035.04 → 2036.24] So it seemed like, okay,
[2036.62 → 2038.66] production quality is not exactly super high here.
[2038.92 → 2040.82] Maybe someone just threw something together
[2040.82 → 2042.62] and uploaded it, whatever.
[2043.36 → 2045.72] And then you get some interviews in there
[2045.72 → 2049.32] that are, like, really high ups at Microsoft,
[2050.22 → 2052.28] like, thanking the quarterback
[2052.28 → 2053.78] that won the Super Bowl
[2053.78 → 2055.62] for intruding the new Madden game.
[2056.12 → 2057.72] And it's like, oh, wow, okay.
[2058.48 → 2061.42] And there's a rather extreme
[2061.42 → 2063.36] lack of actual gameplay.
[2065.12 → 2067.84] The length of the video
[2067.84 → 2069.60] is quite surprising.
[2069.84 → 2072.12] It's 27 minutes and 44 seconds.
[2072.12 → 2073.32] They have a lot of games.
[2073.32 → 2074.66] Wow, so it's like half an hour, basically.
[2074.86 → 2076.02] It's really long.
[2076.38 → 2076.62] Okay.
[2076.62 → 2077.88] They have a lot of games
[2077.88 → 2079.60] that they intro.
[2080.38 → 2082.68] And I would say the majority of them
[2082.68 → 2084.18] probably have zero seconds
[2084.18 → 2085.60] of included actual gameplay.
[2085.92 → 2086.20] Okay.
[2087.00 → 2088.78] And the ones that do have
[2088.78 → 2089.84] any actual gameplay,
[2090.32 → 2090.96] a lot of them,
[2091.08 → 2092.10] it's kind of questionable
[2092.10 → 2094.56] of whether it is actual gameplay
[2094.56 → 2096.88] because it's very much spliced
[2096.88 → 2098.96] among definitely cinematic.
[2098.96 → 2100.22] Got it.
[2100.22 → 2102.06] So it's not really certain
[2102.06 → 2102.72] if it's, like,
[2103.70 → 2104.98] a cinematic of gameplay
[2104.98 → 2106.00] which isn't really real
[2106.00 → 2106.92] or not.
[2106.92 → 2107.88] Like an in-engine
[2107.88 → 2110.54] but pre-rendered type of cinematic.
[2110.90 → 2111.00] Yeah.
[2111.00 → 2111.68] Yeah, it's really hard
[2111.68 → 2112.42] to tell the difference.
[2113.18 → 2113.48] Yes.
[2113.66 → 2114.80] They do have notices
[2114.80 → 2117.20] before a lot of the games.
[2117.36 → 2118.42] I'm not sure if it's all of them.
[2118.50 → 2119.42] It might be all of them
[2119.42 → 2121.72] that say it's in-engine.
[2122.34 → 2122.56] Yeah.
[2122.60 → 2122.92] But, like,
[2122.96 → 2123.98] that doesn't really mean anything
[2123.98 → 2124.68] when it's a cinematic.
[2125.16 → 2125.50] Yes.
[2125.50 → 2127.10] So, yeah,
[2127.20 → 2129.18] it's completely BS
[2129.18 → 2130.86] and I'm honestly surprised
[2130.86 → 2132.58] it has as many likes as it does.
[2133.42 → 2134.78] And I'm assuming it does
[2134.78 → 2135.86] just from people
[2135.86 → 2136.36] that, like,
[2136.48 → 2136.96] watched it
[2136.96 → 2138.34] and ignored the word gameplay
[2138.34 → 2138.86] and were like,
[2138.92 → 2139.14] hey,
[2139.26 → 2141.48] half an hour of trailers.
[2141.82 → 2142.58] That's cool.
[2143.52 → 2144.26] So they just,
[2144.42 → 2145.38] they watched half an hour
[2145.38 → 2146.30] of ads, basically.
[2147.30 → 2147.60] Yeah.
[2147.66 → 2148.18] And they, like,
[2148.18 → 2149.50] they talk about
[2149.50 → 2151.12] Assassin's Creed Valhalla
[2151.12 → 2151.72] at the beginning
[2151.72 → 2153.90] and then it's the last one
[2153.90 → 2154.56] that they show
[2154.56 → 2156.18] and the like,
[2156.26 → 2157.76] main host for the whole thing
[2157.76 → 2159.34] goes like,
[2159.40 → 2160.02] and that's it.
[2160.14 → 2160.44] Uh-huh.
[2160.50 → 2161.06] Just kidding.
[2161.18 → 2162.18] There's Assassin's Creed Valhalla.
[2162.32 → 2163.18] Like, it's very much
[2163.18 → 2164.20] a setup thing.
[2164.40 → 2165.80] And then Valhalla has,
[2166.04 → 2167.52] as far as I can tell,
[2168.24 → 2170.12] zero seconds of gameplay.
[2170.76 → 2171.34] It's just a trailer.
[2172.10 → 2172.54] Wow.
[2173.48 → 2174.36] Really feels like
[2174.36 → 2174.86] just a trailer.
[2174.86 → 2175.50] That's embarrassing.
[2175.68 → 2176.36] Maybe their gameplay
[2176.36 → 2178.14] has become extremely cinematic,
[2178.62 → 2180.00] but I'm pretty sure it's just...
[2180.00 → 2180.20] You know,
[2180.24 → 2181.22] you'd think they would have learned
[2181.22 → 2181.98] from last time.
[2182.08 → 2182.22] You know,
[2182.26 → 2183.10] remember when they launched
[2183.10 → 2184.22] the Xbox One?
[2184.56 → 2185.32] And they were like,
[2185.88 → 2186.16] okay,
[2186.40 → 2188.34] it's a media hub.
[2189.28 → 2190.74] And then Sony was like,
[2191.40 → 2192.14] you idiots.
[2192.78 → 2193.66] The PlayStation 4
[2193.66 → 2194.52] is a game console.
[2195.92 → 2196.08] Yeah.
[2196.30 → 2196.88] Mic drop,
[2197.18 → 2198.64] one console generation.
[2199.18 → 2199.38] Like,
[2199.88 → 2200.42] guys,
[2201.06 → 2201.64] please,
[2201.76 → 2203.92] take the actual gaming seriously.
[2204.60 → 2206.54] It just doesn't seem that hard.
[2207.62 → 2208.26] Does it?
[2208.36 → 2208.68] Is it?
[2209.42 → 2209.80] No.
[2210.06 → 2211.24] And I just skimmed through
[2211.24 → 2212.18] the Valhalla part again,
[2212.22 → 2213.44] there's no way any of this
[2213.44 → 2215.56] is even attempting at gameplay.
[2216.12 → 2217.34] It should have been like
[2217.34 → 2220.02] an engine,
[2220.60 → 2221.38] like first look,
[2221.48 → 2222.44] Xbox Series X.
[2222.56 → 2222.84] Yeah.
[2223.26 → 2224.88] Games in engine or something.
[2225.10 → 2225.34] And like,
[2225.40 → 2226.18] that's cool.
[2226.28 → 2226.70] That's fine.
[2226.70 → 2227.56] Or just teasing.
[2227.90 → 2229.58] Teasing the Xbox Series X
[2229.58 → 2231.06] launch title lineup.
[2231.74 → 2231.92] Whatever.
[2232.72 → 2234.08] And that could have maybe been cool.
[2234.26 → 2235.40] But they just have to stop
[2235.40 → 2236.72] being so disrespectful
[2236.72 → 2238.30] of people's intelligence.
[2239.54 → 2239.76] Like,
[2240.06 → 2240.82] then again,
[2241.00 → 2241.34] you know,
[2241.48 → 2241.98] apparently,
[2242.64 → 2243.32] however many,
[2243.38 → 2244.62] 15,000 people
[2244.62 → 2245.96] couldn't tell or didn't care.
[2247.62 → 2248.02] So...
[2248.02 → 2248.34] 19.
[2248.50 → 2248.70] Yeah,
[2248.82 → 2250.20] 19,000 people liked it.
[2250.30 → 2251.66] More people disliked it
[2251.66 → 2252.42] than liked it though.
[2252.44 → 2252.76] Yes.
[2252.88 → 2253.92] And I really don't think
[2253.92 → 2255.02] you're gaining like
[2255.02 → 2256.98] a ton
[2256.98 → 2258.60] from people watching
[2258.60 → 2261.72] a massive amount of trailers.
[2261.98 → 2262.64] I'm sure a lot of them
[2262.64 → 2263.30] got skipped through.
[2263.30 → 2264.04] I was going to say
[2264.04 → 2265.40] like a small portion
[2265.40 → 2265.88] of a video,
[2266.16 → 2267.24] but I'm sure they just
[2267.24 → 2267.70] skipped through
[2267.70 → 2268.32] to find games
[2268.32 → 2269.00] they're interested in.
[2269.80 → 2271.30] I had a perfect question
[2271.30 → 2272.52] in the Twitch chat.
[2272.64 → 2273.04] I actually,
[2273.22 → 2274.50] I can't see who asked it anymore.
[2274.66 → 2274.78] Oh,
[2274.84 → 2275.18] what's that?
[2276.10 → 2277.14] I just want to show
[2277.14 → 2278.28] the world premiere thing.
[2281.48 → 2281.88] No,
[2281.96 → 2282.36] it's fine.
[2282.76 → 2283.52] I want to screen capture.
[2283.70 → 2283.98] Oh,
[2284.12 → 2284.50] here it is.
[2284.80 → 2285.66] Terrazoidal asks,
[2285.76 → 2286.48] are you guys going to talk
[2286.48 → 2287.82] about the Wink smart home hub
[2287.82 → 2288.74] going paid only?
[2289.38 → 2291.18] This has been causing
[2291.18 → 2291.86] very,
[2291.86 → 2293.12] very small waves
[2293.12 → 2294.26] or big waves
[2294.26 → 2295.20] in a small community.
[2295.38 → 2296.20] Why don't we say that?
[2296.46 → 2297.04] Because it's,
[2297.10 → 2297.72] it's a pretty,
[2297.80 → 2298.82] it's a pretty niche community,
[2299.04 → 2301.86] but Wink smart hub.
[2303.56 → 2304.04] Basically,
[2304.04 → 2304.52] it's a
[2304.58 → 2305.14] it's a product
[2305.14 → 2306.46] that helps you manage
[2306.46 → 2308.52] multiple ecosystems
[2308.52 → 2309.84] of smart products
[2309.84 → 2311.54] from one device
[2311.54 → 2313.58] or from one like controller.
[2313.58 → 2313.70] other.
[2314.26 → 2315.94] And my understanding
[2315.94 → 2317.00] was that it,
[2317.20 → 2318.68] there was a free option
[2318.68 → 2319.56] at least available
[2319.56 → 2320.34] in the past.
[2320.78 → 2321.68] So once you bought
[2321.68 → 2322.28] the product,
[2322.36 → 2323.14] you were able
[2323.14 → 2324.16] to run it for free,
[2324.16 → 2326.02] but they basically went,
[2326.34 → 2326.48] hey,
[2326.60 → 2328.10] surprise next week.
[2328.46 → 2329.74] And I think the price
[2329.74 → 2330.94] is going to be
[2330.94 → 2332.48] $5 a month.
[2332.48 → 2333.22] I want to say,
[2333.22 → 2334.50] here we go.
[2334.56 → 2335.74] Introducing Wink subscription.
[2335.74 → 2337.18] So this just happened
[2337.18 → 2338.00] a couple of days ago.
[2338.00 → 2338.30] I've,
[2338.42 → 2339.48] I was sort of paying attention
[2339.48 → 2340.34] to this out of the corner
[2340.34 → 2340.84] of my eye.
[2341.32 → 2341.66] Um,
[2341.66 → 2341.80] yep.
[2341.82 → 2342.44] We are transitioning
[2342.44 → 2344.40] to a $4.99 monthly subscription
[2344.40 → 2345.50] on May 13th,
[2345.52 → 2345.88] 2020.
[2346.00 → 2347.28] So people got effectively
[2347.28 → 2349.38] one week of notice.
[2349.64 → 2350.86] This fee is designed
[2350.86 → 2351.74] to be as modest
[2351.74 → 2352.58] as possible.
[2352.86 → 2354.16] $5 a month
[2354.16 → 2356.24] is not modest.
[2357.88 → 2358.40] That's,
[2358.48 → 2359.26] that's like,
[2359.90 → 2360.30] I,
[2360.38 → 2360.64] I,
[2360.68 → 2362.58] I really enjoy this service
[2362.58 → 2364.18] and I like really care about it.
[2364.20 → 2365.62] That is $60 a year.
[2366.46 → 2366.90] Um,
[2368.20 → 2369.00] should you choose
[2369.00 → 2369.58] not to sign up
[2369.58 → 2370.08] for a subscription?
[2370.34 → 2371.42] You will no longer
[2371.42 → 2372.24] be able to access
[2372.24 → 2372.96] your Wink devices
[2372.96 → 2373.56] from the app
[2373.56 → 2374.50] with voice control
[2374.50 → 2375.56] or through the API
[2375.56 → 2376.42] and your automations
[2376.42 → 2377.10] will be disabled
[2377.10 → 2378.28] on May 13th.
[2378.78 → 2379.22] Like,
[2379.56 → 2380.16] straight up,
[2380.52 → 2382.56] we are turning this off.
[2382.94 → 2383.60] Your device connection
[2383.60 → 2384.44] settings and automations
[2384.44 → 2385.54] can be reactivated
[2385.54 → 2386.32] if you decide
[2386.32 → 2386.96] to subscribe
[2386.96 → 2387.94] at a later date.
[2388.00 → 2388.58] So effectively,
[2389.02 → 2390.96] anyone who bought it,
[2390.96 → 2391.48] um,
[2392.26 → 2392.52] duh,
[2393.14 → 2394.30] has a paperweight now
[2394.30 → 2395.00] if they don't want
[2395.00 → 2395.72] to pay the subscription.
[2395.88 → 2396.62] This is a pretty,
[2397.14 → 2398.32] this is the kind
[2398.32 → 2399.34] of bait and switch
[2399.34 → 2400.96] that I don't really understand
[2400.96 → 2402.14] how it doesn't lead
[2402.14 → 2402.70] to a lawsuit
[2402.70 → 2404.04] unless they were really careful
[2404.04 → 2405.16] with their terms of service
[2405.16 → 2406.50] in the lead up to this.
[2407.14 → 2407.54] Yeah.
[2409.00 → 2409.44] Honestly,
[2409.44 → 2410.68] I was trying to figure out
[2410.68 → 2411.98] if anything other than
[2411.98 → 2413.14] the banner at the top
[2413.14 → 2414.16] that says subscribe now
[2414.16 → 2415.52] to keep your service active,
[2415.66 → 2417.32] which is so aggro,
[2417.52 → 2417.98] by the way,
[2418.08 → 2419.08] when it's all capital
[2419.08 → 2420.08] and underscored.
[2420.74 → 2421.16] Um,
[2421.24 → 2421.42] yeah,
[2421.56 → 2422.26] but I was,
[2422.34 → 2423.30] I was trying to see
[2423.30 → 2424.22] if there's anywhere else
[2424.22 → 2424.92] on the site that,
[2424.98 → 2426.60] that says that you have
[2426.60 → 2427.44] to pay a subscription
[2427.44 → 2428.88] and I'm trying to add it
[2428.88 → 2429.60] to my cart
[2429.60 → 2430.86] to see if it tells me that
[2430.86 → 2432.44] and I can't.
[2432.56 → 2432.92] Oh yeah,
[2433.04 → 2433.20] no,
[2433.30 → 2434.32] add to cart's not working.
[2434.76 → 2435.02] Yeah.
[2436.12 → 2436.48] Interesting.
[2437.48 → 2437.82] I mean,
[2437.82 → 2438.68] there's been speculation
[2438.68 → 2439.60] that these guys
[2439.60 → 2440.74] have been running out
[2440.74 → 2441.20] of money.
[2441.62 → 2441.94] Um,
[2441.96 → 2442.44] apparently,
[2442.82 → 2443.84] I actually don't know
[2443.84 → 2444.70] if I have notes on here,
[2444.70 → 2445.70] so I'm talking off
[2445.70 → 2446.44] the top of my head,
[2446.50 → 2447.32] so I'm just going to say,
[2447.40 → 2447.66] uh,
[2447.88 → 2448.28] allegedly,
[2448.50 → 2448.88] allegedly,
[2449.36 → 2449.76] um,
[2449.80 → 2450.28] allegedly,
[2450.28 → 2450.86] their,
[2450.86 → 2452.10] their staff have not been
[2452.10 → 2453.14] paid in some time,
[2453.14 → 2455.32] which is always a bad sign.
[2455.66 → 2456.68] Literally every time
[2456.68 → 2457.54] that's a bad sign.
[2458.18 → 2458.58] Um,
[2459.32 → 2460.10] so I understand
[2460.10 → 2461.14] why they're doing it.
[2461.24 → 2462.40] I think that they could
[2462.40 → 2463.14] have probably,
[2463.54 → 2463.92] you know,
[2464.38 → 2464.76] I mean,
[2464.76 → 2465.52] maybe they have no money,
[2465.68 → 2465.98] you know,
[2466.14 → 2466.68] I was going to say,
[2466.72 → 2467.24] maybe they could have
[2467.24 → 2468.18] hired a PR firm
[2468.18 → 2469.18] to walk them through
[2469.18 → 2469.94] doing this in a way
[2469.94 → 2470.54] that's a little bit
[2470.54 → 2471.54] less confrontational.
[2471.80 → 2473.14] If they had maybe said,
[2473.32 → 2474.16] Hey guys,
[2474.56 → 2475.62] here's the situation.
[2476.34 → 2476.82] We,
[2477.08 → 2477.70] um,
[2477.80 → 2478.04] we,
[2478.04 → 2478.86] we are out of money.
[2479.08 → 2480.44] So we're instituting
[2480.44 → 2482.04] a voluntary subscription
[2482.04 → 2482.82] to support
[2482.82 → 2484.00] our ongoing development.
[2485.12 → 2485.52] Um,
[2485.60 → 2486.60] please subscribe
[2486.60 → 2487.74] if you care about Wink
[2487.74 → 2488.22] and you want it
[2488.22 → 2488.86] to have a future.
[2488.98 → 2489.32] We're going to do
[2489.32 → 2490.12] five bucks a month.
[2490.30 → 2491.30] And then if
[2491.30 → 2492.30] three months later,
[2492.42 → 2493.12] six months later,
[2493.12 → 2493.78] they had said,
[2494.38 → 2494.98] Hey,
[2495.24 → 2495.56] uh,
[2495.56 → 2496.40] there are some features
[2496.40 → 2497.26] that are no longer
[2497.26 → 2498.76] available to our free tier.
[2498.86 → 2499.80] Here's what they are.
[2499.92 → 2501.38] And then six months later,
[2501.38 → 2501.88] they went,
[2502.00 → 2502.22] Hey,
[2502.74 → 2503.00] yeah,
[2503.00 → 2503.86] you're going to have to pay.
[2504.00 → 2505.26] If they had boiled the frog
[2505.26 → 2506.08] a little bit on this,
[2506.16 → 2507.08] I think they,
[2507.20 → 2507.92] they could have avoided
[2507.92 → 2508.88] a lot of this backlash,
[2508.88 → 2509.88] but as it is now,
[2509.98 → 2511.34] this is just such a slap
[2511.34 → 2511.78] in the face,
[2511.78 → 2512.92] but they may have just been
[2512.92 → 2514.34] that desperate.
[2514.52 → 2515.54] It is hard to say
[2515.54 → 2516.20] unless you're a
[2516.20 → 2517.10] you're a fly on the wall
[2517.10 → 2518.04] for these conversations.
[2518.82 → 2520.04] So it looks like,
[2520.36 → 2520.80] uh,
[2520.86 → 2521.12] I'm,
[2521.12 → 2522.00] I'm assuming you can't
[2522.00 → 2522.84] add anything to cart
[2522.84 → 2524.50] until you like create
[2524.50 → 2525.02] an account.
[2525.68 → 2528.42] And it also looks like
[2528.42 → 2529.28] on the creator
[2529.28 → 2530.16] and account page,
[2530.18 → 2530.86] they make it
[2530.86 → 2532.28] pretty clear now
[2532.28 → 2533.10] that you need to
[2533.10 → 2534.86] no long-term commitments
[2534.86 → 2535.96] except that you like
[2535.96 → 2536.78] bought this device.
[2536.78 → 2536.92] See,
[2537.28 → 2538.80] I find it so offensive
[2538.80 → 2540.14] when companies
[2540.14 → 2541.36] try to double-dip,
[2541.40 → 2541.66] right?
[2542.00 → 2542.40] Like,
[2542.74 → 2543.84] I remember buying
[2543.84 → 2544.64] a drop cam
[2544.64 → 2545.80] and realizing
[2545.80 → 2546.62] that I just paid
[2546.62 → 2547.76] $200
[2547.76 → 2549.08] for a device
[2549.08 → 2549.84] that I then
[2549.84 → 2550.64] had to pay
[2550.64 → 2551.44] a monthly subscription
[2551.44 → 2551.86] for.
[2552.56 → 2552.96] No.
[2554.12 → 2554.90] Just no.
[2555.92 → 2556.50] Bake it
[2556.50 → 2557.94] into the subscription
[2557.94 → 2559.24] or
[2559.24 → 2560.72] charge me a premium
[2560.72 → 2562.18] for your shiny device.
[2562.80 → 2563.74] Those are the options.
[2564.42 → 2565.04] does that mean
[2565.04 → 2566.04] that you would prefer
[2566.04 → 2567.40] minimum,
[2567.62 → 2568.50] uh,
[2568.62 → 2569.74] terms then?
[2570.10 → 2570.68] Because like,
[2570.76 → 2570.88] if,
[2570.92 → 2571.32] if they're going to
[2571.32 → 2572.18] bake it into the subscription,
[2572.18 → 2572.76] they're going to have
[2572.76 → 2573.74] to have you subscribe
[2573.74 → 2574.74] for a minimum amount
[2574.74 → 2575.20] of time.
[2575.58 → 2575.98] Sure.
[2576.00 → 2576.44] And then you're still
[2576.44 → 2577.06] going to be paying
[2577.06 → 2577.60] the $200.
[2578.06 → 2578.72] It's just on like
[2578.72 → 2579.50] a payment plan,
[2579.58 → 2579.96] basically.
[2580.12 → 2580.70] That's fair.
[2580.96 → 2582.34] But then I think
[2582.34 → 2583.44] that there's probably
[2583.44 → 2583.98] some,
[2584.04 → 2584.24] uh,
[2584.24 → 2584.76] there's probably
[2584.76 → 2585.38] some,
[2585.38 → 2585.82] some,
[2585.82 → 2587.64] some economic
[2587.64 → 2588.62] modelling that can
[2588.62 → 2589.16] be done
[2589.16 → 2589.96] to go,
[2590.08 → 2590.32] okay,
[2590.34 → 2590.52] well,
[2590.54 → 2591.30] instead of $200,
[2591.30 → 2592.48] the draw cam
[2592.48 → 2593.82] could be 30 bucks,
[2593.88 → 2594.40] which is below
[2594.40 → 2595.24] our cost of
[2595.24 → 2597.16] $42.61.
[2597.60 → 2598.46] But most people
[2598.46 → 2599.28] will probably subscribe
[2599.28 → 2599.70] for at least
[2599.70 → 2600.30] a couple of months.
[2601.48 → 2602.50] There's a middle ground
[2602.50 → 2602.74] then.
[2603.26 → 2603.70] But by the
[2603.78 → 2604.88] when you pay $200
[2604.88 → 2606.46] for that stupid thing,
[2606.80 → 2607.30] which is,
[2607.34 → 2607.56] you know,
[2607.62 → 2608.48] basically what?
[2608.56 → 2609.00] Like a
[2609.00 → 2609.76] a Pi Zero
[2609.76 → 2610.68] and a cheap camera
[2610.68 → 2611.08] on it?
[2611.32 → 2611.66] Like,
[2612.20 → 2613.40] let's get real here
[2613.40 → 2614.02] for a minute.
[2614.44 → 2615.38] That's not worth.
[2615.38 → 2615.90] they're making money
[2615.90 → 2616.84] off the device
[2616.84 → 2617.80] and the subscription
[2617.80 → 2618.28] as well.
[2618.36 → 2618.84] Exactly.
[2619.18 → 2619.62] Exactly.
[2619.62 → 2619.78] Yeah.
[2621.30 → 2623.74] makes sense.
[2623.92 → 2624.82] Can't really argue
[2624.82 → 2625.82] against that too much.
[2625.98 → 2626.42] I don't think.
[2628.06 → 2628.74] I just,
[2628.92 → 2630.48] I basically just
[2630.48 → 2631.06] wouldn't want to be
[2631.06 → 2631.58] in a situation
[2631.58 → 2631.94] where like,
[2631.98 → 2632.72] if I actually liked
[2632.72 → 2633.38] the product
[2633.38 → 2634.76] and they increased
[2634.76 → 2635.96] the monthly
[2635.96 → 2636.66] to make it
[2636.66 → 2637.36] so that I covered
[2637.36 → 2638.60] the cost of the device,
[2639.16 → 2639.66] uh,
[2639.72 → 2640.66] I wouldn't want to
[2640.66 → 2641.58] have to keep paying
[2641.58 → 2642.14] that monthly
[2642.14 → 2643.64] for way past
[2643.64 → 2644.18] when I would have
[2644.18 → 2645.18] paid for the device.
[2645.34 → 2645.50] Right.
[2645.50 → 2646.34] um,
[2646.44 → 2646.68] says,
[2646.76 → 2646.98] says,
[2647.06 → 2647.38] a good way
[2647.38 → 2647.80] to do it
[2647.80 → 2648.48] is the $200
[2648.48 → 2649.58] includes X
[2649.58 → 2650.26] number of months
[2650.26 → 2650.62] for free.
[2650.74 → 2651.28] My problem
[2651.28 → 2651.60] with that
[2651.60 → 2652.42] is they usually
[2652.42 → 2653.42] cheap out on it.
[2653.82 → 2654.18] Like,
[2654.22 → 2654.72] they give it to you
[2654.72 → 2655.36] for like three months
[2655.36 → 2655.82] or something.
[2656.16 → 2656.42] Yeah.
[2656.66 → 2657.52] And that's,
[2657.60 → 2657.90] that,
[2658.00 → 2658.86] I find that really,
[2658.98 → 2660.02] I find that really frustrating.
[2660.96 → 2661.20] Yeah.
[2662.70 → 2663.06] They,
[2663.10 → 2664.08] they could even do a thing
[2664.08 → 2664.50] where like,
[2664.54 → 2665.24] you have to put in
[2665.24 → 2666.26] your credit card first,
[2666.56 → 2666.94] uh,
[2666.94 → 2667.62] but then it gives you
[2667.62 → 2668.56] like a year for free
[2668.56 → 2669.12] or something.
[2669.32 → 2669.50] Yep.
[2669.50 → 2669.54] Yep.
[2669.60 → 2670.36] A year or like
[2670.36 → 2670.94] a couple of years.
[2671.12 → 2671.16] Like,
[2671.24 → 2672.64] if this thing is good enough
[2672.64 → 2673.16] that I'm in it
[2673.16 → 2674.14] for the long haul here,
[2674.26 → 2675.98] then put your money
[2675.98 → 2676.60] where your mouth is.
[2676.66 → 2676.80] Right?
[2677.62 → 2677.84] Yeah.
[2678.70 → 2679.74] Especially when you factor
[2679.74 → 2680.46] in how little
[2680.46 → 2681.78] some of these services cost,
[2681.88 → 2682.38] like with,
[2682.50 → 2682.72] uh,
[2682.74 → 2683.78] with the Drop cam
[2683.78 → 2684.40] in particular,
[2684.52 → 2685.66] which is now Nest Cam,
[2686.18 → 2686.60] uh,
[2686.66 → 2686.82] the
[2686.86 → 2687.60] the paid subscription
[2687.60 → 2688.66] didn't even have like
[2688.66 → 2689.62] perpetual data storage
[2689.62 → 2690.04] or anything.
[2690.04 → 2691.00] Like I wasn't paying
[2691.00 → 2691.72] for cloud storage.
[2691.72 → 2691.96] It was,
[2692.04 → 2693.20] it was like temporary storage.
[2693.20 → 2693.74] It was just like
[2693.74 → 2694.38] how much of it.
[2694.58 → 2695.14] It's like,
[2695.14 → 2696.50] this is so little bandwidth
[2696.50 → 2697.74] that you guys are
[2697.74 → 2699.84] basically just milking it
[2699.84 → 2700.36] at this point.
[2700.98 → 2701.40] Yeah.
[2702.64 → 2705.60] Uh,
[2705.60 → 2711.48] what else we got
[2711.48 → 2712.48] to discuss today?
[2714.40 → 2715.44] Microsoft confirms
[2715.44 → 2716.34] that Windows 10X
[2716.34 → 2717.36] will be coming to laptops.
[2717.60 → 2718.84] So that's the dual screen
[2718.84 → 2719.88] tablet style edition
[2719.88 → 2720.28] of Windows
[2720.28 → 2721.00] that was originally
[2721.00 → 2721.98] designed for highly
[2721.98 → 2722.82] mobile devices.
[2723.18 → 2723.58] Apparently,
[2723.78 → 2724.22] we'll be making
[2724.22 → 2725.04] its first appearance
[2725.04 → 2726.28] on single screen devices.
[2727.06 → 2728.18] So this is a quote
[2728.18 → 2729.00] with Windows 10X
[2729.00 → 2730.28] we designed for flexibility
[2730.28 → 2731.10] and that flexibility
[2731.10 → 2731.66] has enabled us
[2731.66 → 2732.32] to pivot our focus
[2732.32 → 2733.20] towards single screen.
[2733.82 → 2734.34] So it's like,
[2734.44 → 2734.72] okay.
[2734.84 → 2735.56] Anthony previously
[2735.56 → 2736.84] looked at Windows 10X,
[2736.96 → 2737.24] uh,
[2737.24 → 2737.88] the beta of it
[2737.88 → 2738.54] on short circuit
[2738.54 → 2739.02] where he saw
[2739.02 → 2739.62] what he considered
[2739.62 → 2740.52] a very Windows 8
[2740.52 → 2741.10] like UI
[2741.10 → 2741.74] complete with
[2741.74 → 2742.84] full screen apps,
[2743.22 → 2743.66] um,
[2744.44 → 2745.16] and relegating
[2745.16 → 2746.42] native Windows 32 apps
[2746.42 → 2747.62] to running in special containers
[2747.62 → 2748.32] in order to focus
[2748.32 → 2749.44] on UWP apps.
[2749.84 → 2750.58] Microsoft claims
[2750.58 → 2751.24] this is to improve
[2751.24 → 2751.96] power efficiency
[2751.96 → 2752.68] and he expressed
[2752.68 → 2753.12] a concern
[2753.12 → 2753.74] that it may end up
[2753.74 → 2754.82] on more consumer devices
[2754.82 → 2755.40] than just
[2755.40 → 2756.72] special purpose ones.
[2756.72 → 2757.24] and it seems
[2757.24 → 2758.34] like this is happening.
[2758.50 → 2758.86] Good job,
[2758.94 → 2759.18] Anthony,
[2759.50 → 2760.70] except that you cheated
[2760.70 → 2762.66] and you used another video
[2762.66 → 2763.40] that you shot
[2763.40 → 2764.92] as a WAN show topic again.
[2765.42 → 2765.96] Way to go,
[2766.12 → 2766.42] Anthony.
[2767.24 → 2767.68] You know,
[2767.72 → 2768.36] that's what my uncle
[2768.36 → 2768.80] always says,
[2768.86 → 2768.96] though.
[2769.02 → 2769.18] You know,
[2769.18 → 2769.80] you got to leverage
[2769.80 → 2770.30] your work.
[2770.52 → 2770.84] Leverage,
[2770.94 → 2771.20] leverage,
[2771.32 → 2771.58] leverage.
[2771.72 → 2772.52] Don't do work twice
[2772.52 → 2773.34] when you can do work
[2773.34 → 2774.48] once and leverage it twice.
[2774.68 → 2775.04] I'm like,
[2775.10 → 2775.32] okay,
[2775.32 → 2775.80] thank you.
[2775.86 → 2776.20] Thank you,
[2776.24 → 2776.62] Uncle Skip.
[2776.74 → 2777.52] I appreciate that.
[2778.20 → 2779.04] There's an event
[2779.04 → 2780.00] going on the forum
[2780.00 → 2780.46] right now,
[2780.68 → 2781.68] the LTT forum
[2781.68 → 2783.46] point pentathlon.
[2783.46 → 2784.40] So we've talked
[2784.40 → 2785.28] about folding at home
[2785.28 → 2786.44] and the amazing things
[2786.44 → 2787.34] that the LTT folding
[2787.34 → 2788.04] at home team
[2788.04 → 2789.16] has been doing
[2789.16 → 2790.38] and this won't even
[2790.38 → 2791.82] fully disrupt that.
[2791.94 → 2792.76] This is still using
[2792.76 → 2793.70] your compute power
[2793.70 → 2794.96] to help the world
[2794.96 → 2796.38] but this one
[2796.38 → 2797.64] is very CPU focused.
[2798.46 → 2800.28] So they want you
[2800.28 → 2801.70] to set up Brink
[2801.70 → 2803.86] to run Rosetta at home
[2803.86 → 2805.22] which is doing
[2805.22 → 2806.64] COVID compute research
[2806.64 → 2808.96] and is the marathon event.
[2809.38 → 2810.64] Rosetta is CPU only,
[2810.82 → 2811.02] however.
[2811.42 → 2812.00] So if you set up
[2812.00 → 2812.54] your Brink
[2812.54 → 2813.96] to do CPU work
[2813.96 → 2815.42] for Rosetta at home
[2815.42 → 2816.66] and help COVID stuff,
[2816.96 → 2817.84] you can keep running
[2817.84 → 2818.70] folding at home
[2818.70 → 2819.80] on your GPU
[2819.80 → 2821.56] and continue to do
[2821.56 → 2822.72] COVID research
[2822.72 → 2823.48] in that way.
[2823.84 → 2824.58] So just make sure
[2824.58 → 2824.98] you join
[2824.98 → 2825.80] Linus Tech Tips
[2825.80 → 2826.68] underscore team
[2826.68 → 2827.36] during the account
[2827.36 → 2828.46] creation and completion
[2828.46 → 2828.96] process
[2828.96 → 2829.80] and it's probably
[2829.80 → 2830.54] also a good idea
[2830.54 → 2831.20] to change the
[2831.20 → 2831.92] computing preferences
[2831.92 → 2832.86] on the project website
[2832.86 → 2835.24] to about 75% CPUs
[2835.24 → 2836.68] or leave two threads
[2836.68 → 2837.54] free so your computer
[2837.54 → 2838.90] is still usable.
[2839.36 → 2839.88] Brink can also
[2839.88 → 2840.64] pause automatically
[2840.64 → 2841.28] if you fire up
[2841.28 → 2841.82] something demanding
[2841.82 → 2842.40] like a game
[2842.40 → 2843.12] and then it can resume
[2843.12 → 2843.92] again when the computer
[2843.92 → 2844.26] is idle.
[2845.02 → 2845.84] One other
[2845.84 → 2847.22] very important piece
[2847.22 → 2849.12] of Linus Tech Tips
[2849.12 → 2849.82] related news
[2849.82 → 2850.32] that we do have
[2850.32 → 2850.64] to go through
[2850.64 → 2851.10] this week
[2851.10 → 2852.86] is that LTX 2020
[2852.86 → 2854.10] is officially
[2854.10 → 2856.56] on ice.
[2856.90 → 2857.84] It's out,
[2858.08 → 2858.62] it's done.
[2859.20 → 2860.68] We do technically
[2860.68 → 2861.76] still have a venue
[2861.76 → 2863.12] like booked
[2863.12 → 2864.80] but we will not
[2864.80 → 2866.04] be able to do
[2866.04 → 2867.74] any kind of event
[2867.74 → 2868.88] with the sort of scale
[2868.88 → 2869.88] that we had anticipated
[2869.88 → 2870.52] this year.
[2871.90 → 2873.68] I kind of screwed up
[2873.68 → 2874.64] this whole thing.
[2875.06 → 2875.78] Speaking of,
[2875.82 → 2875.98] you know,
[2876.00 → 2877.08] needing PR classes,
[2877.42 → 2877.56] you know,
[2877.60 → 2878.14] I was talking about
[2878.14 → 2878.60] Wink there.
[2879.80 → 2880.88] I should have just
[2880.88 → 2882.00] accepted much earlier
[2882.00 → 2882.78] on that this was
[2882.78 → 2883.44] going to happen
[2883.44 → 2884.88] and just cancelled it
[2884.88 → 2885.74] months ago.
[2886.02 → 2886.76] Like we were still
[2886.76 → 2887.64] making announcements
[2887.64 → 2888.46] when other people
[2888.46 → 2889.12] were cancelling
[2889.12 → 2889.62] their events
[2889.62 → 2890.10] and I guess
[2890.10 → 2890.80] that was just
[2890.80 → 2892.50] my inexperience
[2892.50 → 2893.14] and also
[2893.14 → 2894.58] my hope
[2894.58 → 2895.78] that we,
[2896.04 → 2896.32] you know,
[2897.20 → 2898.58] some kind of,
[2898.64 → 2899.32] it would turn out
[2899.32 → 2900.28] to not be as
[2900.28 → 2901.58] bad as we thought
[2901.58 → 2902.14] it was
[2902.14 → 2903.42] or the lockdown
[2903.42 → 2904.00] restrictions
[2904.00 → 2905.12] wouldn't be so
[2905.12 → 2906.08] pervasive
[2906.08 → 2907.20] or whatever.
[2907.52 → 2907.88] I just,
[2908.02 → 2908.36] I kind of,
[2908.42 → 2909.10] I hoped something
[2909.10 → 2910.08] good would happen.
[2910.44 → 2911.26] It didn't
[2911.26 → 2913.06] and LTX 2020
[2913.06 → 2913.82] is not going to be able
[2913.82 → 2914.46] to proceed the way
[2914.46 → 2914.92] that we hoped.
[2915.00 → 2915.28] We would,
[2915.46 → 2916.44] we still want to do
[2916.44 → 2917.30] something,
[2917.80 → 2918.98] some kind of fun
[2918.98 → 2919.98] community engagement
[2919.98 → 2921.00] slash creator
[2921.00 → 2922.66] collab thing.
[2922.82 → 2923.18] It just,
[2923.30 → 2924.14] it won't be that
[2924.14 → 2926.28] and all I can say
[2926.28 → 2926.92] now is,
[2926.98 → 2927.12] you know,
[2927.18 → 2927.74] sorry guys,
[2928.32 → 2929.24] we really tried.
[2929.40 → 2929.90] I really,
[2930.02 → 2931.14] really wanted to do it.
[2931.20 → 2931.92] This was the year
[2931.92 → 2933.52] that not only
[2933.52 → 2934.64] was LTX
[2934.64 → 2935.12] going to like
[2935.12 → 2936.42] really glow up
[2936.42 → 2938.00] but we might have
[2938.00 → 2938.58] even made money
[2938.58 → 2939.22] on it this year.
[2939.30 → 2939.84] We had a lot of
[2939.84 → 2940.90] really generous sponsors
[2940.90 → 2941.62] reach out and say,
[2941.72 → 2941.84] hey,
[2942.22 → 2942.94] you guys have like
[2942.94 → 2944.62] really created
[2944.62 → 2945.56] something special here
[2945.56 → 2946.54] and we want to support it.
[2947.08 → 2947.96] We've lost money
[2947.96 → 2948.80] on it every year.
[2948.80 → 2950.04] So this was like
[2950.04 → 2950.80] the year that it was
[2950.80 → 2951.38] going to be like
[2951.38 → 2953.02] big time.
[2953.40 → 2954.70] LTX is a real event
[2954.70 → 2954.90] now.
[2954.98 → 2957.12] I was so excited
[2957.12 → 2959.34] and now I am
[2959.34 → 2959.62] bummed.
[2961.14 → 2961.82] I have,
[2961.92 → 2962.82] I have some ideas
[2962.82 → 2964.14] by the way.
[2964.40 → 2964.84] Good.
[2965.26 → 2965.84] We do too.
[2965.86 → 2966.80] Very cool
[2966.80 → 2967.62] and fun things
[2967.62 → 2968.64] that maybe I can
[2968.64 → 2969.44] hopefully contribute.
[2969.76 → 2970.56] That would be,
[2970.62 → 2971.12] that would be
[2971.12 → 2971.84] freaking awesome
[2971.84 → 2973.26] because we really
[2973.26 → 2974.02] want to kind of
[2974.02 → 2975.06] salvage whatever
[2975.06 → 2976.22] we can out of it.
[2976.22 → 2977.70] Yeah.
[2978.66 → 2978.94] Ah,
[2979.08 → 2979.74] now I'm like
[2979.74 → 2980.36] bummed.
[2981.64 → 2982.04] Uh,
[2982.12 → 2982.40] okay.
[2982.48 → 2983.24] In other news,
[2983.64 → 2984.22] Nintendo Wii
[2984.22 → 2984.84] source code
[2984.84 → 2985.80] and design documents
[2985.80 → 2986.34] were leaked on
[2986.34 → 2987.48] 4chan of all places.
[2988.08 → 2988.60] After an attack
[2988.60 → 2989.52] on hosting provider
[2989.52 → 2990.18] Broad On,
[2990.30 → 2990.96] hackers have released
[2990.96 → 2991.96] a massive dump
[2991.96 → 2992.90] of technical information
[2992.90 → 2994.02] about the Nintendo Wii.
[2994.12 → 2995.28] It includes source code,
[2995.78 → 2996.10] what,
[2996.24 → 2997.36] for the black box,
[2997.90 → 2998.66] boot zero,
[2998.82 → 2999.20] boot one,
[2999.36 → 3000.44] and boot two ROMs,
[3000.68 → 3001.80] documents describing
[3001.80 → 3002.52] feature planning
[3002.52 → 3003.30] and implementation,
[3003.30 → 3004.20] APIs,
[3004.44 → 3005.20] internal software,
[3005.36 → 3006.40] the full OS SDK
[3006.40 → 3007.14] and source code,
[3007.56 → 3008.34] source code and info
[3008.34 → 3009.06] on manufacturing
[3009.06 → 3010.06] and publishing systems
[3010.06 → 3011.16] and more.
[3012.30 → 3012.90] Ladies and gentlemen,
[3013.36 → 3013.98] we got them.
[3014.48 → 3014.96] What?
[3015.34 → 3016.06] It's been reported
[3016.06 → 3016.66] that source code
[3016.66 → 3017.36] for the N64
[3017.36 → 3018.28] and Game Cube
[3018.28 → 3019.46] along with debug builds
[3019.46 → 3020.06] and source code
[3020.06 → 3021.28] for legacy Pokémon games
[3021.28 → 3021.72] and much,
[3021.82 → 3022.22] much more
[3022.22 → 3023.46] is also in there.
[3024.30 → 3025.34] Nintendo is presumably
[3025.34 → 3026.14] itching to unleash
[3026.14 → 3026.58] their lawyers
[3026.58 → 3027.46] on anyone who so much
[3027.46 → 3028.02] as hints
[3028.02 → 3028.82] at using any
[3028.82 → 3029.50] of this information.
[3030.12 → 3030.92] So projects like
[3030.92 → 3031.82] Dolphin Emulator,
[3031.96 → 3032.38] for example,
[3032.38 → 3032.96] are not likely
[3032.96 → 3033.70] to see much benefit
[3033.70 → 3034.04] from it,
[3034.12 → 3035.22] but it's possible
[3035.22 → 3035.98] that bug fixes
[3035.98 → 3036.76] for edge cases
[3036.76 → 3037.62] may find their way
[3037.62 → 3038.08] and eventually
[3038.08 → 3039.22] as people become familiar
[3039.22 → 3040.28] with these documents
[3040.28 → 3041.08] and code.
[3041.38 → 3042.36] It is an open source
[3042.36 → 3043.38] project after all.
[3044.84 → 3044.96] Yeah.
[3045.48 → 3047.24] So they could like,
[3047.78 → 3048.10] you know,
[3048.16 → 3049.92] not use the exact source code
[3049.92 → 3050.56] but they could learn
[3050.56 → 3051.30] from it basically.
[3051.88 → 3052.32] Exactly,
[3052.56 → 3053.06] exactly.
[3053.56 → 3054.08] Dang,
[3054.22 → 3054.64] Nintendo,
[3054.88 → 3056.04] that kind of blows.
[3056.70 → 3057.00] I mean,
[3057.02 → 3057.80] it's good for like
[3057.80 → 3058.32] the homebrew
[3058.32 → 3059.22] and hacker community,
[3059.22 → 3059.68] I guess,
[3059.82 → 3061.54] but yeah,
[3061.54 → 3062.46] not great,
[3062.64 → 3063.82] not great for you.
[3066.30 → 3067.70] What else we got here?
[3070.96 → 3071.68] Starting to run
[3071.68 → 3072.34] slightly thin.
[3072.52 → 3072.70] Yeah,
[3072.76 → 3073.24] starting to run
[3073.24 → 3073.84] a little bit thin.
[3073.96 → 3074.68] Microsoft announced
[3074.68 → 3075.68] a bunch of Surface stuff,
[3075.82 → 3076.66] so Surface Go 2
[3076.66 → 3077.40] has thinner screen
[3077.40 → 3077.78] and bigger,
[3078.00 → 3078.60] thinner bezels
[3078.60 → 3079.32] and a bigger screen.
[3080.20 → 3080.86] Still a little
[3080.86 → 3081.74] on the chunky side.
[3081.86 → 3082.68] Core M3 CPU
[3082.68 → 3083.10] is apparently
[3083.10 → 3084.62] 64% faster
[3084.62 → 3085.16] than the old one,
[3085.22 → 3085.98] but like that was
[3085.98 → 3086.52] really slow.
[3086.96 → 3088.28] Now has the Studio Mic
[3088.28 → 3089.38] that the Pro Series has
[3089.38 → 3090.64] and it's got Wi-Fi 6.
[3091.06 → 3091.24] Hey,
[3091.32 → 3091.66] take that,
[3091.74 → 3092.24] MacBook Air.
[3092.62 → 3093.74] There's also an LTE model,
[3093.92 → 3094.56] so that's pretty sick.
[3094.68 → 3095.22] No pricing,
[3095.36 → 3096.16] but probably going to start
[3096.16 → 3096.60] around $500.
[3097.12 → 3097.90] Surface Book 3
[3097.90 → 3099.26] is basically a Surface Book 2
[3099.26 → 3100.24] with better internals,
[3100.34 → 3100.78] 10th gen
[3100.78 → 3102.72] and GTX 1650 Max-Q
[3102.72 → 3103.06] or,
[3103.54 → 3105.66] wow,
[3105.88 → 3107.00] 1660 Ti Max-Q
[3107.00 → 3109.34] or Squadron RTX 3000
[3109.34 → 3110.42] in the 15-inch model.
[3110.86 → 3111.06] Wow,
[3111.22 → 3112.02] 1650 Max-Q
[3112.02 → 3112.72] and 13-inch.
[3113.24 → 3113.48] Okay,
[3113.54 → 3114.06] that's pretty cool.
[3114.42 → 3115.80] Screen releases
[3115.80 → 3116.74] two times faster
[3116.74 → 3117.24] from the base
[3117.24 → 3118.12] and it's got Dolby Atmos
[3118.12 → 3119.54] and Surface Headphones 2
[3119.54 → 3120.30] are now in black.
[3120.68 → 3120.92] Ooh,
[3121.32 → 3121.76] sexy.
[3122.54 → 3123.20] And they've also got
[3123.20 → 3124.14] Surface earbuds.
[3124.34 → 3125.28] This is kind of a big deal.
[3126.82 → 3127.18] Sorry,
[3127.30 → 3127.40] yeah,
[3127.40 → 3127.88] it's a big deal
[3127.88 → 3129.06] and they're also kind of big.
[3129.30 → 3129.84] It's a big deal
[3129.84 → 3130.42] in a couple of ways.
[3130.52 → 3130.94] The big Surface
[3130.94 → 3131.90] allows gestures though,
[3132.26 → 3133.64] so they could be really cool
[3133.64 → 3134.58] for controlling your audio
[3134.58 → 3135.24] or they could just be
[3135.24 → 3135.72] a pain in the butt
[3135.72 → 3136.62] when you go and scratch your ear.
[3136.74 → 3137.80] Only time shall tell.
[3138.10 → 3139.08] No noise-cancelling,
[3139.34 → 3139.66] $200.
[3142.18 → 3144.72] More fantastic VPN news.
[3144.90 → 3145.22] Yeah.
[3145.22 → 3147.74] There's always great VPN news
[3147.74 → 3148.32] on Sancho.
[3148.54 → 3148.84] Yeah, yeah.
[3148.94 → 3150.02] Crucial vulnerabilities
[3150.02 → 3151.82] in prominent VPN services,
[3152.10 → 3154.06] private VPN and Better Net.
[3154.52 → 3154.86] Yes,
[3154.88 → 3155.62] it's not someone
[3155.62 → 3157.10] we're promoting this time.
[3157.42 → 3157.74] Woo!
[3157.74 → 3158.40] Have been discovered
[3158.40 → 3159.58] that could have allowed
[3159.58 → 3160.78] complete control
[3160.78 → 3161.58] over a computer
[3161.58 → 3163.06] running their clients
[3163.06 → 3164.70] via a rogue software update.
[3165.04 → 3166.12] While both VPN companies
[3166.12 → 3167.50] appear to have patched the issue,
[3167.88 → 3168.98] neither made an announcement
[3168.98 → 3170.02] to affect the users.
[3170.52 → 3171.48] Bad form,
[3172.20 → 3172.58] people.
[3172.98 → 3173.60] That is not how
[3173.60 → 3174.40] that's supposed to work.
[3174.40 → 3176.16] This came as part
[3176.16 → 3177.30] of a larger test
[3177.30 → 3178.88] of 20 VPN service providers,
[3179.00 → 3179.94] including heavy hitters
[3179.94 → 3180.56] like NordVPN,
[3180.72 → 3181.26] Express VPN,
[3181.42 → 3181.84] and PIA.
[3182.40 → 3184.06] 14 of the VPN services
[3184.06 → 3185.08] had no issues,
[3185.46 → 3187.66] while six allowed
[3187.66 → 3189.16] intercepting client-server
[3189.16 → 3189.72] communications,
[3189.92 → 3190.50] although Better Net
[3190.50 → 3191.46] and Private VPN
[3191.46 → 3192.74] connected to the
[3192.74 → 3194.24] proof-of-concept attack server
[3194.24 → 3195.70] and downloaded the software.
[3195.84 → 3196.18] Ouch.
[3196.96 → 3197.94] Yeah, big yikes.
[3198.00 → 3198.66] So I guess we're not
[3198.66 → 3199.68] completely clear here.
[3200.08 → 3200.98] Better Net did not
[3200.98 → 3202.12] automatically install
[3202.12 → 3203.00] the malicious update,
[3203.86 → 3205.10] but Private VPN did.
[3206.36 → 3207.82] While most users
[3207.82 → 3208.30] at home
[3208.30 → 3209.12] won't ever see
[3209.12 → 3210.00] such a hijack,
[3210.38 → 3211.94] that's probably quite true,
[3212.24 → 3212.88] the threat of man
[3212.88 → 3213.68] in the middle attacks
[3213.68 → 3214.66] like these
[3214.66 → 3216.18] in public situations
[3216.18 → 3217.10] using untrusted
[3217.10 → 3218.00] access points,
[3218.66 → 3219.20] the old school
[3219.20 → 3220.14] café attacks,
[3220.54 → 3221.16] hotels,
[3221.32 → 3221.64] airports,
[3221.72 → 3222.14] and whatnot
[3222.14 → 3223.78] is ironically
[3223.78 → 3224.60] one of the main
[3224.60 → 3225.68] selling points of VPNs
[3225.68 → 3227.28] and is making you
[3227.28 → 3227.82] quite vulnerable
[3227.82 → 3229.18] with that solution.
[3229.36 → 3229.92] Yeah, bummer.
[3230.52 → 3231.02] Not fun.
[3231.42 → 3232.72] Finally, Super Mario 64
[3232.72 → 3233.88] was ported to the PC.
[3234.40 → 3235.28] It has a native port
[3235.28 → 3236.12] on PC complete
[3236.12 → 3236.88] with widescreen
[3236.88 → 3238.14] and high-resolution graphics.
[3238.62 → 3238.96] Of course,
[3239.04 → 3240.38] this isn't a Nintendo initiative
[3240.38 → 3241.12] and is likely
[3241.12 → 3241.82] to be shut down.
[3241.96 → 3242.66] Oh, there's a link
[3242.66 → 3243.74] already done.
[3244.64 → 3246.12] So that happened today
[3246.12 → 3247.18] at 2.30 p.m.,
[3247.18 → 3248.32] so about four hours ago.
[3250.32 → 3251.28] Womp.
[3251.28 → 3252.64] It was made with data
[3252.64 → 3253.66] gathered from the
[3253.66 → 3255.30] fan-run Super Mario 64
[3255.30 → 3256.84] recompilation project,
[3256.92 → 3257.70] a project with the goal
[3257.70 → 3258.56] of decompiling
[3258.56 → 3259.54] Super Mario 64
[3259.54 → 3261.16] in order to understand
[3261.16 → 3262.16] and document
[3262.16 → 3262.96] the game's code.
[3263.46 → 3263.98] This means that
[3263.98 → 3264.84] the individual or team
[3264.84 → 3265.40] doing the port
[3265.40 → 3266.32] had to translate
[3266.32 → 3267.70] the N64-specific
[3267.70 → 3268.22] instructions
[3268.22 → 3268.86] to something that
[3268.86 → 3269.64] would run on a PC
[3269.64 → 3271.14] using modern graphics
[3271.14 → 3272.10] libraries like
[3272.10 → 3273.30] OpenGL and Direct3D.
[3273.66 → 3274.20] As a result,
[3274.30 → 3275.10] it may be possible
[3275.10 → 3275.72] to run the game
[3275.72 → 3276.86] on much lower-end
[3276.86 → 3277.20] hardware
[3277.20 → 3278.20] as there is no
[3278.20 → 3279.56] emulation taking place.
[3280.44 → 3280.76] Wow.
[3280.76 → 3281.44] I, like,
[3281.78 → 3282.76] seriously need
[3282.76 → 3284.04] to get my hands
[3284.04 → 3284.36] on this
[3284.36 → 3285.26] before it's impossible
[3285.26 → 3285.90] to find.
[3287.36 → 3287.80] Yeah.
[3289.72 → 3290.28] I mean,
[3290.34 → 3291.24] I'm down to just
[3291.24 → 3292.26] go buy the...
[3292.26 → 3292.66] I mean,
[3292.68 → 3293.10] we talked about
[3293.10 → 3293.76] this last week.
[3293.82 → 3294.72] As far as I'm concerned,
[3294.78 → 3295.46] if I go buy
[3295.46 → 3296.92] the cartridge,
[3297.12 → 3297.98] then I can play
[3297.98 → 3298.70] this guilt-free.
[3299.14 → 3299.20] Like,
[3299.38 → 3300.08] it's not like
[3300.08 → 3301.78] Nintendo did any work
[3301.78 → 3302.40] on this project.
[3304.56 → 3306.06] That is so cool.
[3307.06 → 3307.46] Apparently,
[3307.46 → 3308.24] they ported it
[3308.24 → 3309.22] to the Switch, too.
[3309.22 → 3311.24] Wow.
[3312.24 → 3312.72] So,
[3312.80 → 3313.94] PC all the way
[3313.94 → 3314.68] back down to Switch.
[3314.82 → 3315.90] I love neck beards.
[3316.24 → 3317.04] I really do.
[3317.64 → 3318.80] They are the best
[3318.80 → 3319.88] because they make
[3319.88 → 3321.10] my life so much better.
[3322.02 → 3322.82] Thank you,
[3323.06 → 3323.62] neck beards.
[3324.10 → 3324.84] And I'm not
[3324.84 → 3325.74] generalizing.
[3326.08 → 3326.72] I'm just saying
[3326.72 → 3327.86] that there are
[3327.86 → 3328.48] definitely people
[3328.48 → 3329.04] who worked on this
[3329.04 → 3329.68] project who have
[3329.68 → 3330.10] a neck beard.
[3330.20 → 3330.84] That's all I'm saying.
[3331.84 → 3332.32] Wait,
[3332.38 → 3333.18] that's a generalization.
[3333.58 → 3333.88] Crap!
[3333.88 → 3334.94] Caught again.
[3335.54 → 3336.58] Fell into my own trap.
[3337.80 → 3338.30] He totally
[3338.30 → 3338.88] kept digging
[3338.88 → 3339.44] when he should have
[3339.44 → 3339.78] stopped.
[3341.14 → 3341.54] Yeah,
[3341.66 → 3342.70] I'm sure this will be
[3342.70 → 3344.42] findable online.
[3345.46 → 3346.40] Seems like most of
[3346.40 → 3347.12] the links are dead
[3347.12 → 3347.56] right now,
[3347.70 → 3348.82] but I'm sure
[3348.82 → 3350.22] they will continue
[3350.22 → 3350.94] to circulate.
[3351.06 → 3351.18] Yeah,
[3351.20 → 3351.80] I'm sure Nintendo
[3351.80 → 3352.68] is super happy
[3352.68 → 3353.34] about this one.
[3354.42 → 3354.66] Yeah.
[3355.70 → 3356.32] All right.
[3356.74 → 3357.68] I don't remember
[3357.68 → 3358.22] what it's called,
[3358.38 → 3359.06] but maybe this will
[3359.06 → 3359.66] do that thing
[3359.66 → 3360.34] where when you try
[3360.34 → 3360.98] to hide it on the
[3360.98 → 3361.24] internet,
[3361.42 → 3361.88] it just ends up
[3361.88 → 3362.56] spreading more.
[3362.56 → 3363.04] Yeah,
[3363.12 → 3363.56] there we go.
[3363.68 → 3363.80] Yeah.
[3365.08 → 3365.68] All right.
[3365.74 → 3366.40] We've got to do a couple
[3366.40 → 3367.10] super chats here,
[3367.14 → 3367.62] ladies and gentlemen.
[3367.82 → 3368.56] Metal Gappy says,
[3368.64 → 3369.62] sorry to hear about LTX.
[3369.68 → 3370.42] I was hoping BC
[3370.42 → 3371.32] would be able to squeak
[3371.32 → 3371.58] by,
[3371.70 → 3372.88] but no such luck.
[3373.02 → 3373.80] Here's hoping for a
[3373.80 → 3374.94] better year next year.
[3375.10 → 3377.72] I truly also hope
[3377.72 → 3379.32] for a better luck
[3379.32 → 3380.46] next time situation.
[3381.02 → 3381.96] Robert May hill says,
[3382.04 → 3382.90] donation three of
[3382.90 → 3383.62] waiting for short
[3383.62 → 3384.48] circuit t-shirts.
[3384.62 → 3384.94] We're not,
[3385.20 → 3385.94] I told you,
[3386.00 → 3386.86] we don't even have
[3386.86 → 3387.40] any planned.
[3387.40 → 3388.56] I said it explicitly
[3388.56 → 3389.24] last week.
[3389.32 → 3389.82] Why do you keep
[3389.82 → 3390.92] spending money to tell
[3390.92 → 3391.92] me you're waiting
[3391.92 → 3392.40] for something
[3392.40 → 3393.20] that isn't coming?
[3393.32 → 3393.74] We're working
[3393.74 → 3394.62] on a long sleeve,
[3394.76 → 3394.94] Robert.
[3395.38 → 3396.06] We are working
[3396.06 → 3396.92] on a long sleeve.
[3397.28 → 3397.60] No,
[3397.68 → 3398.14] keep pushing.
[3398.34 → 3398.70] It'll work.
[3398.98 → 3399.22] Keep pushing.
[3400.10 → 3400.86] I believe.
[3401.30 → 3402.22] You don't.
[3402.28 → 3403.34] You know fully well.
[3403.48 → 3405.26] I don't lie on this show.
[3405.38 → 3405.86] I'm not like,
[3406.26 → 3406.52] yeah,
[3406.52 → 3407.56] we're not working on this.
[3407.66 → 3407.80] Oh,
[3407.86 → 3408.30] surprise.
[3408.44 → 3408.98] Here it is.
[3409.54 → 3409.60] Like,
[3409.84 → 3411.04] no,
[3411.12 → 3411.38] no,
[3411.44 → 3412.48] just keep throwing money
[3412.48 → 3412.72] at them.
[3412.82 → 3413.32] It'll happen.
[3414.78 → 3415.48] DJ says,
[3415.48 → 3415.96] how do you feel
[3415.96 → 3416.58] about the roast
[3416.58 → 3417.46] since some time
[3417.46 → 3417.84] has passed
[3417.84 → 3418.50] since it happened?
[3418.50 → 3421.18] How do you feel
[3421.18 → 3421.80] about the roast?
[3422.90 → 3423.08] Me?
[3423.36 → 3423.64] Yeah.
[3424.04 → 3424.56] And can you lean
[3424.56 → 3425.28] a little bit to your right?
[3425.84 → 3426.54] I got a lean too.
[3426.66 → 3427.28] We're both not centred
[3427.28 → 3427.58] anywhere.
[3427.70 → 3427.92] I thought it was a really cool
[3427.92 → 3428.84] experience.
[3429.26 → 3430.14] I thought it was perfect.
[3430.26 → 3430.46] Oh yeah,
[3430.48 → 3430.88] I had a blast.
[3430.90 → 3432.18] It was fun from the
[3432.18 → 3433.36] float plane side of things.
[3433.52 → 3434.80] We learned a lot
[3434.80 → 3436.16] and developed really cool
[3436.16 → 3437.10] things for it.
[3438.78 → 3439.58] And it was,
[3439.58 → 3440.10] it was,
[3440.36 → 3441.22] the event itself
[3441.22 → 3442.00] was super fun.
[3443.08 → 3443.48] Totally.
[3443.66 → 3444.24] I had a blast.
[3444.24 → 3445.12] I don't think it
[3445.12 → 3446.42] necessarily like
[3446.42 → 3448.36] made the most sense.
[3449.12 → 3449.62] Oh no,
[3449.64 → 3450.14] we lost money.
[3450.66 → 3450.92] Yeah.
[3450.96 → 3451.68] I doubt you guys
[3451.68 → 3452.18] would end up doing
[3452.18 → 3452.66] another one,
[3452.80 → 3453.76] but it was really fun
[3453.76 → 3454.02] to do.
[3454.18 → 3454.48] No,
[3454.88 → 3455.50] we wouldn't.
[3456.54 → 3457.38] It was a lot
[3457.38 → 3457.92] to coordinate.
[3458.16 → 3459.22] It was a total blast.
[3459.28 → 3460.24] It was a once in a lifetime
[3460.24 → 3461.44] thing and
[3461.44 → 3463.08] that's it.
[3463.16 → 3464.16] But no regrets
[3464.16 → 3464.74] whatsoever.
[3465.50 → 3465.76] No.
[3465.88 → 3466.02] Yeah,
[3466.02 → 3466.64] it was great.
[3469.16 → 3469.52] Okay.
[3469.58 → 3470.34] What else we got here?
[3470.36 → 3470.88] I'm not going to do
[3470.88 → 3471.52] too many today
[3471.52 → 3471.98] because we,
[3471.98 → 3473.04] we started the show
[3473.04 → 3473.48] so late,
[3473.48 → 3474.48] but epic stuff
[3474.48 → 3474.98] for you says
[3474.98 → 3475.54] been watching you
[3475.54 → 3475.92] for years,
[3475.98 → 3476.36] figured maybe
[3476.36 → 3476.88] I should send you
[3476.88 → 3478.02] some dollars raise
[3478.02 → 3479.16] for all the great content.
[3479.28 → 3479.38] Well,
[3479.44 → 3480.84] thank you very much.
[3480.90 → 3481.62] That truly is
[3481.62 → 3482.66] some epic stuff.
[3482.74 → 3483.76] It's a hundred
[3483.76 → 3485.18] of whatever CHFs are.
[3485.78 → 3486.94] I really wish that,
[3487.04 → 3488.10] I told YouTube this
[3488.10 → 3488.82] like a year ago.
[3488.90 → 3489.14] I was like,
[3489.20 → 3489.36] hey,
[3489.50 → 3490.36] it's really cool
[3490.36 → 3490.88] that you show
[3490.88 → 3491.76] all the different currencies
[3491.76 → 3492.78] that people donate in
[3492.78 → 3493.76] because like it
[3493.76 → 3494.88] makes you feel like,
[3494.98 → 3495.14] you know,
[3495.16 → 3495.66] you're part of this
[3495.66 → 3496.66] like global community,
[3496.76 → 3496.96] right?
[3497.56 → 3498.86] But I would really like
[3498.86 → 3499.74] to be able to mouse over
[3499.74 → 3500.94] and know how much it is
[3500.94 → 3502.24] in like freedom dollars
[3502.24 → 3502.66] or whatever.
[3503.48 → 3506.08] Randandy31 says,
[3506.16 → 3507.28] hello from South Australia.
[3507.40 → 3508.22] Just curious how much
[3508.22 → 3509.18] YouTube premium pays
[3509.18 → 3510.32] versus normal ad views
[3510.32 → 3511.08] and do YouTubers
[3511.08 → 3511.78] still get paid
[3511.78 → 3512.50] for premium viewers
[3512.50 → 3513.62] on demonetized content?
[3514.12 → 3514.38] Wow,
[3514.46 → 3516.18] that is a fantastic question.
[3516.28 → 3516.96] That last bit,
[3517.08 → 3518.36] I have no idea,
[3518.48 → 3519.08] but I am,
[3519.20 → 3520.68] I am very curious
[3520.68 → 3521.44] to know the answer
[3521.44 → 3522.24] to the point where
[3522.24 → 3523.36] I am going to just
[3523.36 → 3524.32] fire over an email
[3524.32 → 3525.12] to the
[3525.12 → 3526.00] the bat phone
[3526.00 → 3527.44] that I have here.
[3527.44 → 3529.62] do you get paid
[3529.62 → 3531.16] for YouTube
[3531.16 → 3533.24] premium views
[3533.24 → 3535.76] on demonetized
[3535.76 → 3537.24] content
[3537.24 → 3538.22] or
[3538.22 → 3539.82] does it just affect
[3539.82 → 3541.20] AdSense?
[3542.04 → 3542.80] It's fascinating.
[3542.98 → 3543.22] Yeah,
[3543.32 → 3544.52] I have no idea.
[3544.60 → 3545.32] That's such a great question.
[3545.38 → 3546.06] We don't really deal
[3546.06 → 3547.06] with it that much,
[3547.06 → 3548.12] so it hasn't been
[3548.12 → 3549.18] a major concern for me.
[3549.54 → 3550.98] I feel like you should
[3550.98 → 3552.04] because they're technically
[3552.04 → 3553.90] completely disconnected systems.
[3553.90 → 3554.06] Yeah,
[3554.10 → 3555.00] they're just paying viewers,
[3555.10 → 3555.30] right?
[3555.84 → 3556.16] Yeah.
[3557.22 → 3558.32] So it shouldn't matter.
[3559.60 → 3561.00] But I also would be surprised
[3561.00 → 3561.68] if you don't.
[3563.04 → 3564.30] Linus says,
[3564.54 → 3564.74] oh,
[3564.80 → 3564.96] wait,
[3565.04 → 3565.18] sorry,
[3565.26 → 3566.06] to answer your question,
[3566.16 → 3566.60] Rand Andy,
[3567.14 → 3568.32] way more,
[3568.66 → 3568.98] way more.
[3569.06 → 3570.24] A YouTube premium viewer
[3570.24 → 3571.28] is worth like
[3571.28 → 3572.28] an order of magnitude
[3572.28 → 3573.22] more than
[3573.22 → 3575.38] like an ad supported viewer
[3575.38 → 3576.26] in terms of money.
[3577.32 → 3578.50] I don't mean worth.
[3578.64 → 3579.46] You guys are all worth
[3579.46 → 3580.06] a lot to me,
[3580.14 → 3581.32] but in terms of money,
[3581.44 → 3582.26] they contribute
[3582.26 → 3583.02] far more
[3583.02 → 3583.80] to our bottom line.
[3584.66 → 3585.42] Linus says,
[3585.54 → 3586.54] will the OG float plane
[3586.54 → 3586.98] subscription
[3586.98 → 3588.62] get a yearly version?
[3590.14 → 3591.24] Do we have any plans
[3591.24 → 3591.78] to do that?
[3593.36 → 3593.98] Do you?
[3594.62 → 3595.34] I don't know.
[3595.44 → 3596.44] Can we even do that?
[3596.48 → 3596.86] Because I thought
[3596.86 → 3597.38] there was a whole
[3597.38 → 3598.90] like migration issue
[3598.90 → 3599.50] that we had.
[3599.58 → 3600.52] That was why we just
[3600.52 → 3602.56] like grandfathered
[3602.56 → 3603.28] that plan in
[3603.28 → 3604.00] as like a weird
[3604.00 → 3604.96] hidden plan or something.
[3605.60 → 3606.00] Yes.
[3606.08 → 3607.32] So we definitely did that.
[3608.16 → 3609.34] As far as I know,
[3609.38 → 3610.30] you could enable
[3610.30 → 3611.44] a yearly option.
[3611.92 → 3612.26] Yeah.
[3612.26 → 3613.20] I think we just don't have
[3613.20 → 3613.64] an easy way
[3613.64 → 3614.52] to lock people,
[3615.16 → 3615.56] lock out
[3615.56 → 3616.38] who can subscribe
[3616.38 → 3616.96] to it
[3616.96 → 3618.04] because we would
[3618.04 → 3618.90] only want people
[3618.90 → 3620.28] who are OG subscribers
[3620.28 → 3621.48] at the $3 a month
[3621.48 → 3622.34] to be able to get it.
[3623.16 → 3623.60] Okay.
[3623.66 → 3624.66] So I see what you mean
[3624.66 → 3624.98] by that.
[3625.04 → 3625.58] I think we could
[3625.58 → 3626.34] still do that.
[3626.78 → 3627.90] I wouldn't necessarily
[3627.90 → 3629.18] recommend giving them
[3629.18 → 3630.28] a further discount
[3630.28 → 3632.74] because I don't think
[3632.74 → 3633.78] there's a...
[3633.78 → 3634.02] Yeah.
[3634.06 → 3634.62] It just would be
[3634.62 → 3635.18] more efficient
[3635.18 → 3636.42] from a billing standpoint.
[3636.60 → 3636.84] Yes.
[3636.84 → 3637.48] We wouldn't give up
[3637.48 → 3638.26] so much to PayPal.
[3638.26 → 3638.50] It would probably be
[3638.50 → 3641.04] lighter and better
[3641.04 → 3642.72] for people paying
[3642.72 → 3643.48] in foreign currencies.
[3644.54 → 3646.16] So there are benefits to it.
[3648.64 → 3650.04] If you can't
[3650.04 → 3650.56] just do it
[3650.56 → 3650.98] in the dashboard
[3650.98 → 3651.48] right now,
[3651.54 → 3652.60] I can talk to
[3652.60 → 3654.30] Mr. Hiroki about it.
[3654.40 → 3655.02] I don't think
[3655.02 → 3655.66] that would be
[3655.66 → 3656.56] super hard to do.
[3656.82 → 3656.98] Yeah.
[3657.02 → 3657.64] It's just a matter
[3657.64 → 3658.14] of like people
[3658.14 → 3659.18] would have to voluntarily
[3659.18 → 3660.66] change over their thing.
[3660.74 → 3661.32] And if there's anything
[3661.32 → 3661.76] we've learned
[3661.76 → 3662.36] from migrations
[3662.36 → 3662.94] in the past,
[3663.04 → 3663.48] this is people
[3663.48 → 3664.84] are like cannot be arsed.
[3664.84 → 3665.78] Yeah.
[3666.08 → 3667.54] The Moo Master Z says,
[3667.62 → 3668.28] your Adobe video
[3668.28 → 3669.28] shows the value
[3669.28 → 3670.28] of software as a service
[3670.28 → 3671.28] for Linus Media Group.
[3671.40 → 3672.08] Are you not worried
[3672.08 → 3672.62] that if a tool
[3672.62 → 3673.32] is discontinued
[3673.32 → 3674.16] or a company closes,
[3674.32 → 3674.84] you'll potentially
[3674.84 → 3675.46] lose access
[3675.46 → 3676.26] to old content?
[3676.60 → 3677.12] I'm morally
[3677.12 → 3677.66] against software
[3677.66 → 3678.02] as a service.
[3678.12 → 3678.46] Absolutely,
[3678.62 → 3679.16] I'm worried about it.
[3679.18 → 3679.60] I hate it.
[3680.22 → 3681.12] It's just that
[3681.12 → 3682.84] I'm running a business here
[3682.84 → 3683.66] and unfortunately,
[3684.96 → 3686.86] that's the best evil.
[3688.74 → 3689.18] Yeah,
[3689.26 → 3690.10] I don't have
[3690.10 → 3690.66] a better solution
[3690.66 → 3691.14] right now.
[3693.38 → 3694.64] Alex Woolly
[3694.64 → 3694.98] says,
[3695.04 → 3695.46] my girlfriend
[3695.46 → 3696.02] says,
[3696.10 → 3696.52] you look like
[3696.52 → 3696.88] a daddy
[3696.88 → 3697.62] with that beard,
[3697.90 → 3698.54] except I don't
[3698.54 → 3699.12] have a girlfriend
[3699.12 → 3700.16] and I said that.
[3700.64 → 3701.08] Keep up all
[3701.08 → 3701.60] that you do.
[3704.06 → 3704.46] Okay,
[3704.88 → 3705.72] thank you for that.
[3706.40 → 3707.26] The Random Person,
[3707.42 → 3707.68] Linus,
[3707.74 → 3708.32] you inspired me
[3708.32 → 3708.98] to build a PC
[3708.98 → 3710.00] and get into technology.
[3710.82 → 3712.50] Thanks for the super chat.
[3713.42 → 3714.06] Don Gordon,
[3714.16 → 3715.10] first time on the live stream.
[3715.26 → 3715.64] Welcome.
[3717.10 → 3718.18] Kay Bastion says,
[3718.26 → 3718.98] when will the sandals
[3718.98 → 3719.78] be available in the store?
[3719.86 → 3720.24] I've been waiting
[3720.24 → 3721.16] since August 9th,
[3721.18 → 3721.66] 2019.
[3722.08 → 3722.98] No time soon.
[3722.98 → 3724.08] I have not gotten
[3724.08 → 3725.50] any samples
[3725.50 → 3726.18] from factories
[3726.18 → 3726.64] that have been
[3726.64 → 3727.44] anywhere near
[3727.44 → 3728.72] the standard
[3728.72 → 3729.56] that I would want
[3729.56 → 3730.20] it to be up to.
[3730.32 → 3731.20] So we're not there.
[3731.90 → 3733.10] Keep sending super chats.
[3733.46 → 3734.02] It'll happen.
[3734.72 → 3736.10] It doesn't work that way.
[3736.10 → 3736.44] I'm telling you, man,
[3736.48 → 3737.52] if any of you
[3737.52 → 3738.48] have any requests
[3738.48 → 3739.20] for merch things,
[3739.32 → 3740.38] just fire away
[3740.38 → 3741.26] on the super chats.
[3742.36 → 3745.40] It fuels the machine.
[3745.72 → 3746.82] It just keeps things moving.
[3746.82 → 3749.14] No, it doesn't.
[3750.28 → 3751.84] I had a non-super chat,
[3751.94 → 3752.42] just a chat
[3752.42 → 3753.68] that I happened to notice
[3753.68 → 3754.92] as it was scrolling by
[3754.92 → 3755.74] asking what's going on
[3755.74 → 3756.56] with the PewDiePie PC.
[3756.68 → 3757.56] So I have not been
[3757.56 → 3758.58] in direct contact
[3758.58 → 3759.18] with Felix.
[3759.72 → 3760.48] I don't know him
[3760.48 → 3761.40] and I don't think
[3761.40 → 3762.50] as far as I know,
[3762.56 → 3763.50] I don't think he has
[3763.50 → 3764.34] really any desire
[3764.34 → 3768.06] to like engage more
[3768.06 → 3769.98] with like the YouTuber community
[3769.98 → 3770.96] and collabs and stuff.
[3771.00 → 3772.18] It seems like he kind of
[3772.18 → 3773.16] stopped doing that
[3773.16 → 3773.90] a while back.
[3774.48 → 3775.64] At least that's sort of
[3775.64 → 3777.48] what my very distant observation
[3777.48 → 3778.70] has told me.
[3779.40 → 3780.48] So I don't know
[3780.48 → 3781.56] what he is
[3781.56 → 3782.44] or isn't doing with it.
[3782.56 → 3783.82] I did offer to cover
[3783.82 → 3784.98] taking it to a local shop
[3784.98 → 3785.58] to have the motherboard
[3785.58 → 3786.24] swapped out.
[3786.94 → 3787.76] But I don't know
[3787.76 → 3788.72] if he's going to do it.
[3788.78 → 3789.10] I don't know
[3789.10 → 3790.26] if his sponsorships
[3790.26 → 3792.26] with whoever provides his PCs
[3792.26 → 3793.60] even allows him
[3793.60 → 3795.38] to use it.
[3795.76 → 3796.84] We just, you know,
[3796.92 → 3797.98] we built it as a LARC.
[3798.16 → 3799.46] We wanted it to be
[3799.46 → 3800.26] a great machine
[3800.26 → 3801.36] and we wanted it to be
[3801.36 → 3802.48] the reason we built it well
[3802.48 → 3803.22] was we wanted it
[3803.22 → 3803.82] to be good enough
[3803.82 → 3804.70] that he could use it
[3804.70 → 3805.64] if he really wanted to.
[3805.92 → 3806.96] But I honestly
[3806.96 → 3809.40] was not really expecting him
[3809.40 → 3810.38] to daily drive it.
[3811.54 → 3812.44] Like apparently
[3812.44 → 3813.36] would have been awesome.
[3814.14 → 3816.70] But yeah, go ahead.
[3817.48 → 3819.16] Apparently Five has a video
[3819.16 → 3820.06] that talks about it more.
[3820.72 → 3821.06] Oh, OK.
[3821.08 → 3821.70] That makes sense.
[3822.62 → 3823.88] Five was very helpful
[3823.88 → 3825.10] for getting the whole thing done.
[3825.90 → 3826.10] Yeah.
[3826.10 → 3830.16] He's a particular man.
[3830.16 → 3831.26] And then we're going to unmounts.
[3831.48 → 3835.04] He is a meme lord.
[3835.76 → 3836.56] It's fantastic.
[3836.80 → 3837.54] Yes, he is.
[3838.42 → 3838.70] Yeah.
[3838.76 → 3840.82] Like it's ridiculous.
[3841.82 → 3842.64] The guy is like
[3842.64 → 3844.58] a walking living meme.
[3844.92 → 3846.78] I just don't even understand it.
[3848.18 → 3849.38] What video does he have?
[3849.42 → 3849.76] I actually,
[3850.04 → 3851.76] the latest video on his channel
[3851.76 → 3853.42] is from like a month ago.
[3853.70 → 3854.24] He's too old.
[3854.36 → 3854.52] Yeah.
[3854.62 → 3856.34] Someone mentioned in Twitch chat
[3856.34 → 3856.96] that he does,
[3857.04 → 3857.40] but I was like,
[3857.42 → 3858.38] I didn't see it.
[3858.46 → 3858.98] I'm not sure.
[3859.38 → 3861.68] Maybe it's on Twitter or something?
[3861.84 → 3862.62] Yeah, it could be.
[3862.64 → 3863.12] I'm not sure.
[3863.12 → 3863.48] I don't know.
[3863.54 → 3863.86] We'll see.
[3864.02 → 3864.34] We'll see.
[3864.78 → 3865.14] I mean,
[3865.18 → 3866.74] I would be so thrilled
[3866.74 → 3868.20] if he actually used it,
[3868.32 → 3868.86] but I just,
[3869.02 → 3870.70] I know from being an influencer
[3870.70 → 3871.76] and I realize
[3871.76 → 3873.08] this is a very first world problem
[3873.08 → 3874.38] and nobody's going to feel bad for me,
[3874.44 → 3875.52] but people kind of send you
[3875.52 → 3876.96] too much unsolicited crap.
[3877.78 → 3879.30] And sometimes it can actually
[3879.30 → 3880.04] just be a burden
[3880.04 → 3880.56] because you're like,
[3880.60 → 3882.02] what am I going to do with this thing?
[3882.08 → 3882.90] Like how many,
[3883.36 → 3883.72] you know,
[3883.76 → 3885.62] a perfect example is like phone cases.
[3885.86 → 3887.26] How many phone cases
[3887.26 → 3889.12] can one man put on his phone?
[3889.90 → 3891.06] The answer is one.
[3891.42 → 3891.60] You know,
[3891.66 → 3892.00] like I,
[3892.18 → 3894.00] there's just a limit, right?
[3894.60 → 3895.04] Yeah.
[3895.24 → 3896.60] Nick Plum ac says,
[3896.68 → 3896.88] Linus,
[3896.90 → 3897.64] have you showered today?
[3897.82 → 3898.82] I have not showered
[3898.82 → 3899.56] in like three days.
[3899.64 → 3900.64] Look how greasy my hair is.
[3900.64 → 3901.40] I need to go have a shower.
[3901.54 → 3901.94] It's gross.
[3902.72 → 3903.64] And on that note,
[3903.86 → 3905.30] I might do that right now.
[3905.56 → 3906.10] Thank you guys
[3906.10 → 3907.36] for tuning into the WAN show.
[3907.42 → 3908.72] We will see you again next week.
[3909.18 → 3910.16] Same bat time,
[3910.52 → 3911.96] same bat channel.
[3912.70 → 3912.90] Bye.
[3913.38 → 3915.32] Go dislike the Microsoft video.
[3915.70 → 3916.02] Ouch.
[3916.30 → 3916.66] Ouch.
[3917.06 → 3918.28] Why you got to be like that?
[3918.72 → 3920.50] Why you got to be like that?
[3920.64 → 3920.90] Luke.
[3921.50 → 3922.26] I don't even interact
[3922.26 → 3923.40] with YouTube videos that often.
[3923.54 → 3924.10] You monster.
[3924.34 → 3924.66] Lurker.
[3924.96 → 3925.50] You monster.
[3925.50 → 3926.12] But I dislike that one.
[3928.64 → 3929.44] Hold on a second.
[3929.52 → 3929.74] Hold on.
[3929.78 → 3930.46] I got to check something
[3930.46 → 3931.04] real quick here.
[3931.08 → 3931.54] I just got to,
[3931.58 → 3932.34] I got to check something
[3932.34 → 3933.08] for you real quick.
[3934.86 → 3935.54] You know?
[3935.64 → 3935.96] All right.
[3935.98 → 3936.24] Hold on.
[3936.26 → 3936.72] I just need to,
[3936.80 → 3937.80] I need to see if there's anyone
[3937.80 → 3939.56] that we need to like to go in.
[3939.66 → 3940.30] What's it called?
[3940.30 → 3940.64] When you,
[3940.74 → 3941.84] when you dump all your viewers
[3941.84 → 3942.48] on someone.
[3943.44 → 3943.62] Raid.
[3943.96 → 3944.26] Raid.
[3944.32 → 3944.40] Yeah.
[3944.44 → 3945.02] Nobody's on.
[3945.74 → 3946.80] Captain's not live.
[3947.56 → 3948.68] Luke Laugher's not live.
[3948.76 → 3949.92] That guy's such an idiot.
[3950.12 → 3950.76] I can't stand him.
[3950.76 → 3951.32] What a loser.
[3951.32 → 3952.66] He just plays like crap games.
[3952.84 → 3953.28] Like crap.
[3953.28 → 3954.00] What a nerd.
[3954.10 → 3955.44] Plays the crappiest games.
[3955.70 → 3956.46] Are you around?
[3956.64 → 3957.80] Are you done your attic stuff?
[3957.82 → 3958.64] Plenty times not.
[3959.24 → 3960.26] I actually gamed for,
[3960.42 → 3961.58] you kind of missed me.
[3961.64 → 3962.66] I didn't even think to message you.
[3962.74 → 3964.68] I gamed for like five hours yesterday.
[3965.56 → 3966.58] I was playing Anna though.
[3966.62 → 3968.12] I was playing single player Anna.
[3968.26 → 3969.26] It was the lamest thing ever.
[3969.64 → 3970.38] From like a
[3970.52 → 3972.06] from like an engagement with,
[3972.28 → 3973.86] engaging with a friend standpoint.
[3974.28 → 3974.78] But yeah,
[3974.84 → 3975.04] I'm,
[3975.04 → 3975.52] I'm totally,
[3975.52 → 3976.22] I'm totally down.
[3976.32 → 3977.18] I'm down to play some games.
[3977.60 → 3978.02] I was up,
[3978.02 → 3978.88] I was up till four.
[3978.98 → 3980.82] I was so irresponsible last night.
[3981.48 → 3981.98] You could,
[3982.02 → 3983.68] you could raid yourself then.
[3984.02 → 3985.22] I could raid myself.
[3985.32 → 3985.40] No,
[3985.46 → 3986.64] I just like this channel.
[3986.84 → 3988.02] So yeah.
[3988.18 → 3988.44] Yeah.
[3988.46 → 3989.92] But you have to stop this stream.
[3990.10 → 3991.42] So if you just stop the stream
[3991.42 → 3992.08] and start it again,
[3992.08 → 3993.62] it's kind of like raiding yourself.
[3993.62 → 3993.98] Oh,
[3994.08 → 3995.46] I need some dinner first.
[3995.60 → 3997.76] I like hardcore need dinner first.
[3997.84 → 3998.82] I got to put my kids in bed.
[3998.90 → 3998.96] No,
[3999.00 → 3999.28] I do.
[3999.42 → 4000.16] I have responsibilities.
[4000.16 → 4002.36] It's not how you make a successful Twitch streamer.
[4002.90 → 4004.54] I'm not a successful Twitch streamer.
[4004.64 → 4005.24] Neither are you.
[4005.42 → 4007.18] You're the last person who should be giving advice
[4007.18 → 4009.02] on being a successful Twitch streamer.
[4009.66 → 4010.06] Jeez.
[4010.72 → 4010.94] Jeez.
[4010.94 → 4012.16] My orphan is better than I.
[4014.52 → 4014.92] She,
[4015.02 → 4015.76] she straight up is,
[4015.82 → 4016.16] isn't she?
[4016.72 → 4016.96] Yeah.
[4017.36 → 4017.58] Yeah.
[4017.64 → 4018.14] Plenty time.
[4018.46 → 4020.00] She's like making more money on Twitch
[4020.00 → 4020.90] than you ever have.
[4020.90 → 4021.30] Isn't she?
[4021.82 → 4022.48] I bet she is.
[4022.48 → 4022.76] Uh,
[4023.10 → 4023.92] not ever.
[4024.08 → 4024.34] Well,
[4024.44 → 4024.60] yeah,
[4024.60 → 4025.90] but it doesn't count when you're like,
[4026.26 → 4026.82] Hey guys,
[4026.94 → 4027.30] um,
[4027.68 → 4028.02] so,
[4028.40 → 4029.20] um,
[4029.26 → 4030.10] I need a
[4030.40 → 4032.98] I need a valve index and I really,
[4032.98 → 4033.86] um,
[4034.32 → 4034.62] can't,
[4034.62 → 4036.22] I don't want to buy one for myself
[4036.22 → 4037.84] because I have a mortgage now.
[4037.84 → 4038.46] And,
[4038.46 → 4038.84] um,
[4038.84 → 4039.46] it's true.
[4039.52 → 4039.84] Um,
[4039.92 → 4040.24] you know,
[4040.24 → 4041.24] I'm running a startup.
[4041.24 → 4043.38] So if you guys could just kind of,
[4043.38 → 4043.94] you know,
[4043.94 → 4044.76] cheer me enough,
[4044.76 → 4045.38] that would,
[4045.56 → 4047.22] that would cheer me up.
[4047.42 → 4049.28] Then I would be able to get one.
[4050.20 → 4051.64] I'm not going to do anything.
[4051.64 → 4052.08] If you,
[4052.18 → 4052.90] if you cheer,
[4053.06 → 4056.54] I'm just going to casually say thanks and probably ignore you.
[4057.22 → 4057.62] Thanks.
[4057.96 → 4058.56] Every time,
[4058.74 → 4059.48] every time people cheer,
[4059.54 → 4060.52] they don't do it very often.
[4060.52 → 4062.16] And usually I don't look at the chat at all.
[4062.16 → 4063.20] Because I'm playing beat safer,
[4063.32 → 4066.56] which makes it very difficult to look at the chat, or I'm playing Anna.
[4066.56 → 4067.70] And I get like focused,
[4067.72 → 4069.26] I get focused when I play Anna.
[4069.32 → 4070.18] I like barely look at it.
[4070.58 → 4072.34] So half the time people cheer,
[4072.54 → 4075.20] I don't recognize what's going on in the UI.
[4075.20 → 4075.76] And I'm like,
[4075.88 → 4076.06] sorry,
[4076.10 → 4076.58] what is that?
[4077.04 → 4077.80] What is this?
[4078.26 → 4078.46] Oh,
[4078.52 → 4078.74] oh,
[4078.74 → 4079.04] cheering.
[4079.14 → 4079.96] What is cheering again?
[4080.28 → 4081.40] I know what it is now.
[4081.44 → 4082.42] It's like bits or something,
[4082.48 → 4082.70] right?
[4083.38 → 4083.62] Yeah.
[4083.66 → 4084.06] There are bits.
[4084.68 → 4085.86] You cheer with bits.
[4086.62 → 4086.78] Yeah.
[4087.02 → 4087.10] I,
[4087.32 → 4087.62] uh,
[4087.62 → 4090.50] Twitch adds so much junk all the time.
[4090.52 → 4091.96] That I never know what's going on.
[4092.00 → 4092.26] Anyway,
[4092.40 → 4093.14] I'm still,
[4093.32 → 4094.86] I think my last stream,
[4094.90 → 4097.00] I just finally figured out what a hype train even is.
[4097.26 → 4098.74] And now that I even know what it is,
[4098.74 → 4100.18] I don't understand.
[4100.52 → 4103.50] I have not even tried to figure out what that one is.
[4103.84 → 4105.48] I think you're supposed to like,
[4105.60 → 4108.18] make people keep cheering more and more and more.
[4108.82 → 4109.26] Like,
[4109.32 → 4110.30] it's all just like these,
[4110.46 → 4111.36] these horrible,
[4111.36 → 4111.88] like,
[4112.24 → 4112.68] Oh yeah.
[4112.88 → 4116.50] Like casino level gambling mechanisms.
[4116.50 → 4117.06] I just,
[4117.24 → 4120.18] it kind of makes me feel icky quite honestly.
[4120.72 → 4120.96] And like,
[4121.00 → 4122.14] I shamelessly monetize.
[4122.26 → 4124.48] Like I shamelessly monetize everything I do.
[4124.56 → 4125.90] I'm monetizing right now.
[4126.08 → 4127.38] I'm taking super chats.
[4127.54 → 4130.28] I'm taking Twitch contributions and like prime subs.
[4130.40 → 4132.14] I'm taking corporate sponsors.
[4132.28 → 4134.40] I took three corporate sponsors for this show.
[4134.66 → 4136.72] I am a monetization machine.
[4137.40 → 4138.74] And I look at hype train.
[4138.82 → 4139.16] I'm like,
[4140.26 → 4140.52] really?
[4140.52 → 4141.24] Big checks.
[4141.24 → 4143.84] And like,
[4143.90 → 4146.04] if they set it up so that there's like,
[4146.16 → 4146.68] there's the
[4147.08 → 4147.26] okay.
[4147.30 → 4148.50] So I could get some of this wrong.
[4148.58 → 4149.96] Because I still don't really care.
[4150.16 → 4150.34] Yeah.
[4151.00 → 4152.26] Hashtag not a good streamer.
[4152.32 → 4155.84] But if you like to push it to the next milestone or whatever,
[4156.38 → 4158.14] everyone in the chat unlocks,
[4158.28 → 4159.16] I think everyone in the chat,
[4159.28 → 4160.48] maybe just people that contributed.
[4160.66 → 4161.14] I don't know.
[4161.14 → 4161.86] Um,
[4161.88 → 4165.24] they unlock permanent emotes that are like hype train themed.
[4165.70 → 4170.12] So like they try to make it fun, and they give you direct rewards.
[4170.12 → 4170.56] And they're like,
[4170.64 → 4175.38] everyone give them money now and give them money in ways that Twitch can
[4175.38 → 4176.40] siphon part of it off.
[4176.78 → 4178.86] The things that they gave you are just pixels.
[4180.54 → 4181.60] They're just pixels.
[4182.12 → 4182.52] I don't know.
[4182.56 → 4182.74] Every,
[4182.84 → 4184.88] I feel like everything we charge for has a value.
[4184.88 → 4188.68] The only things that we take money from our viewers for our content,
[4188.90 → 4189.36] the content,
[4189.48 → 4193.12] you are directly supporting the content through early access on floatplane.com
[4193.12 → 4195.18] or you are buying merch.
[4196.02 → 4198.66] But there's also like higher quality to that and stuff.
[4198.76 → 4199.02] Yes,
[4199.34 → 4199.66] exactly.
[4200.58 → 4201.20] Higher quality.
[4201.36 → 4201.48] Well,
[4201.52 → 4201.96] there's a high,
[4202.02 → 4203.76] there's a better community over there as well.
[4203.82 → 4204.76] Like the comment section,
[4204.76 → 4208.68] I find myself reading my float plane comments at the beginning of the day.
[4208.68 → 4210.18] And then I'll like,
[4210.22 → 4212.74] look at my YouTube comments for that day's video later.
[4212.96 → 4214.46] Like float plane comments are awesome.
[4214.88 → 4215.58] Um,
[4216.50 → 4216.88] we,
[4216.98 → 4221.12] we actually had a talk today about after we released the
[4221.18 → 4222.90] the new big update.
[4222.90 → 4223.50] That's still,
[4223.64 → 4224.46] it's still a bit out,
[4224.54 → 4225.16] but it's coming,
[4225.26 → 4227.48] which is text picture and audio posts.
[4227.54 → 4229.20] I think this is the first time that I've talked about it.
[4229.52 → 4231.00] Super popular on WAN show.
[4231.14 → 4231.68] It's not,
[4231.82 → 4232.66] it's not that close.
[4232.78 → 4233.46] Don't freak out,
[4233.46 → 4234.16] but it is,
[4234.22 → 4234.80] it is coming.
[4234.94 → 4236.08] It's been worked on for a while.
[4236.44 → 4236.72] Um,
[4236.72 → 4237.86] after that comes out,
[4238.06 → 4239.74] something that we're talking about,
[4239.86 → 4242.72] I don't know if it's going to happen at all or when it will happen,
[4242.72 → 4243.92] if it does happen.
[4244.28 → 4244.64] Uh,
[4244.64 → 4247.12] but like kind of a revamp to the comment section,
[4247.20 → 4248.62] because something we've been discussing,
[4248.62 → 4249.24] it's like,
[4250.20 → 4250.74] um,
[4250.94 → 4255.92] right now our comments are more similar to other websites that have comments,
[4255.92 → 4257.58] not like a forum.
[4257.58 → 4267.70] And we know that the comment section on float plane ubiquitously across all creators is a better experience than the comment section on something like YouTube.
[4267.70 → 4268.30] Yeah.
[4268.30 → 4274.18] So it might be better for us to give a more rich commenting experience.
[4274.18 → 4274.68] Yeah.
[4274.68 → 4275.18] Yeah.
[4275.18 → 4284.26] And it's more similar to something like the Linus tech tips' forum than a traditional like YouTube comments section where you can have better,
[4284.26 → 4286.80] more thorough interaction with each other,
[4286.80 → 4287.80] uh,
[4287.80 → 4288.44] more tools,
[4288.44 → 4289.36] all that kind of stuff.
[4289.36 → 4289.84] Uh,
[4289.84 → 4290.78] just an idea.
[4291.78 → 4292.52] Don't know.
[4292.80 → 4298.98] A lot of people have mentioned that they prefer conversing with each other on the forum versus the comments on flow plane.
[4298.98 → 4299.28] Yeah.
[4299.40 → 4301.50] And that's just made the wheels turn.
[4301.66 → 4303.62] That would be very far down the line if it happens.
[4303.62 → 4304.54] But yeah,
[4304.54 → 4306.42] I actually had someone offer to buy the forum,
[4306.56 → 4307.20] um,
[4307.26 → 4307.86] last week.
[4309.32 → 4309.64] What?
[4309.86 → 4311.06] I told them to go take a hike.
[4311.68 → 4311.88] Uh,
[4311.88 → 4312.92] they were basically like,
[4312.98 → 4313.18] yeah,
[4313.26 → 4313.60] like,
[4313.74 → 4314.06] uh,
[4314.28 → 4314.52] I,
[4314.52 → 4314.76] I,
[4314.76 → 4314.94] I,
[4314.94 → 4316.42] I basically was talking about it.
[4316.44 → 4316.66] I was like,
[4316.68 → 4316.82] yeah,
[4316.82 → 4317.90] it's worthless to me.
[4317.92 → 4318.58] And they're like,
[4318.90 → 4319.16] what?
[4319.58 → 4319.94] And I'm like,
[4319.96 → 4320.06] yeah,
[4320.08 → 4320.22] yeah,
[4320.24 → 4320.42] it's,
[4320.54 → 4320.76] we don't,
[4320.84 → 4322.06] we don't make any money on it.
[4322.10 → 4322.76] And they're like,
[4323.10 → 4323.34] oh,
[4323.44 → 4323.60] well,
[4323.60 → 4323.82] like,
[4323.84 → 4324.58] do you want to sell it?
[4324.66 → 4324.84] I'm like,
[4324.86 → 4325.04] no.
[4325.60 → 4325.96] And they're like,
[4326.00 → 4327.42] but you don't make any money on it.
[4327.42 → 4327.68] I'm like,
[4327.74 → 4327.96] yeah.
[4328.52 → 4328.94] And they're like,
[4329.16 → 4329.38] well,
[4329.52 → 4330.38] I mean,
[4330.38 → 4331.28] we could make money on it.
[4331.34 → 4331.58] I'm like,
[4331.62 → 4331.74] yeah,
[4331.78 → 4333.00] but then the site would suck.
[4333.84 → 4333.98] Yeah.
[4334.20 → 4338.96] Linus Tech Tips forum was created because I wanted a tech forum that I could go to and enjoy.
[4339.44 → 4341.02] That's like the main reason.
[4342.02 → 4343.32] made like no money.
[4344.12 → 4344.52] Uh,
[4344.56 → 4348.08] we made the forum, and it made no money because,
[4348.08 → 4353.94] and we committed to basically it's making no money when we made no money because we were like,
[4353.94 → 4355.06] this just makes more sense.
[4355.32 → 4355.40] Yeah.
[4355.44 → 4355.60] Well,
[4355.68 → 4355.84] I,
[4356.16 → 4357.94] it was created because like,
[4357.96 → 4359.30] so our,
[4359.30 → 4362.34] our code of conduct was created by me and Luke,
[4362.68 → 4363.24] mostly Luke,
[4363.36 → 4364.30] but I,
[4364.30 → 4367.60] I guided sort of what I wanted it to be.
[4367.62 → 4369.02] It had my name on the site.
[4369.12 → 4374.08] So it was really important to me that the spirit of the community was something that I could get behind.
[4374.38 → 4379.62] And so our code of conduct is basically don't be a dick and be excellent to each other.
[4379.70 → 4380.00] Okay.
[4380.00 → 4380.46] Those are,
[4380.58 → 4383.18] those are the main guiding principles of the Linus Tech Tips forum,
[4383.18 → 4387.92] because I was so sick of it being either this,
[4387.96 → 4388.42] extreme,
[4388.42 → 4390.70] where you've got super techie forums,
[4390.70 → 4395.54] where people are disrespectful to anyone who would have the audacity to ask a newbie question.
[4395.54 → 4400.64] And then you've got these super basic forums where people just kind of don't really know what they're talking about.
[4400.64 → 4402.36] I wanted something in between.
[4402.36 → 4406.92] I wanted knowledgeable people who were committed to actually being welcoming to new members.
[4407.92 → 4409.56] And it was also,
[4409.74 → 4409.86] okay,
[4409.94 → 4412.46] so the other half of it was that it was our backup plan.
[4412.58 → 4414.78] In case YouTube went down,
[4414.90 → 4416.36] we needed some way to,
[4416.48 → 4420.06] to own our audience and have some way to reach them.
[4420.06 → 4420.86] If there were,
[4420.92 → 4424.24] if all of a sudden we weren't on YouTube anymore, and you needed to access us somewhere else.
[4424.24 → 4424.62] So it was,
[4424.86 → 4430.32] it was a way to hold on to our community and to have a tech forum that I like,
[4430.36 → 4432.64] I don't go to almost any other tech forum now.
[4433.10 → 4435.66] I just go to linustechtips.com,
[4435.74 → 4438.20] whatever's in the news or like whatever's in the discussion over there.
[4438.20 → 4438.76] It's like,
[4438.78 → 4440.26] it's basically all I need to know.
[4441.28 → 4441.74] It's great.
[4442.42 → 4442.84] Love it.
[4443.46 → 4444.28] So I,
[4444.84 → 4446.84] for no reason other than that,
[4446.84 → 4452.62] my intention would be to leave Linus Tech Tips and calling it independent isn't quite right because it's owned,
[4452.80 → 4455.18] wholly owned by Linus Media Group Incorporated.
[4455.28 → 4457.72] It's not really like independent in that sense.
[4457.84 → 4459.62] It's not like community owned or anything like that,
[4459.68 → 4465.58] but I am the definition of a hands-off owner when it comes to linustechtips.com.
[4465.58 → 4468.70] I actually didn't even look at the analytics for almost two years once.
[4471.28 → 4472.58] That was when I messaged you.
[4472.70 → 4473.04] I was like,
[4473.12 → 4473.44] Hey Luke,
[4473.50 → 4474.92] did you know the forum's still growing?
[4475.36 → 4475.74] And you're like,
[4475.86 → 4476.46] yeah.
[4476.64 → 4477.22] And I'm like,
[4477.30 → 4477.52] yeah,
[4477.58 → 4478.64] well I didn't.
[4481.02 → 4482.82] Cause like we don't put any ads on it really.
[4482.92 → 4483.58] Like it's got like,
[4483.66 → 4483.86] you know,
[4483.88 → 4485.24] a link to display or whatever,
[4485.54 → 4488.96] like a sidebar with the latest Linus Media Group videos,
[4489.26 → 4490.98] like Amazon affiliate link here and there.
[4491.10 → 4493.98] But it is mostly funded by the bronze,
[4493.98 → 4495.08] silver and gold contributors,
[4495.08 → 4497.14] who we were totally up front with right from the start,
[4497.44 → 4499.60] get absolutely nothing for their contributions.
[4500.84 → 4500.98] No,
[4501.12 → 4501.30] they,
[4501.40 → 4502.66] they get ads removed,
[4502.76 → 4503.96] which there are almost none of.
[4504.08 → 4504.20] Yeah.
[4504.32 → 4504.48] Yeah.
[4504.52 → 4504.60] Yeah.
[4504.60 → 4504.76] Yeah.
[4504.76 → 4506.48] And they get access to the bronze,
[4506.58 → 4510.00] silver and gold sections where basically nothing happens.
[4510.46 → 4513.80] Except there is one thread in the bronze section.
[4513.86 → 4515.36] It's like a counting thread or something.
[4515.36 → 4521.96] They're trying to count to 10,000 with images that have that number highly related to it in some way.
[4522.08 → 4522.32] Yeah.
[4522.64 → 4523.38] I love it.
[4524.06 → 4524.22] Yeah.
[4524.44 → 4524.84] It's just,
[4524.90 → 4525.58] it's just random.
[4525.72 → 4526.68] It's a really cool place.
[4526.88 → 4527.50] And I,
[4527.54 → 4530.02] I told those guys that I basically,
[4530.14 → 4530.94] it was hilarious.
[4530.94 → 4536.12] Because I spent like probably five minutes explaining what's so valuable about infotech tips.com.
[4537.00 → 4539.14] And I said explicitly at one point,
[4539.22 → 4541.30] they must not have heard me that it was like,
[4541.30 → 4543.02] absolutely not for sale.
[4543.02 → 4546.26] Like I would not part it out or something or whatever they were asking.
[4546.90 → 4547.22] Um,
[4547.40 → 4548.10] and then at the end of it,
[4548.10 → 4548.52] they were like,
[4548.58 → 4548.74] Oh,
[4548.78 → 4549.00] okay.
[4549.06 → 4550.26] So then like,
[4551.08 → 4551.66] um,
[4551.96 → 4552.20] you know,
[4552.22 → 4553.02] you would part it out.
[4553.06 → 4553.32] I'm like,
[4553.76 → 4554.10] no,
[4554.72 → 4555.42] why would I do that?
[4555.42 → 4556.14] It doesn't make money.
[4556.30 → 4556.68] And they were like,
[4556.74 → 4557.80] Oh yeah.
[4557.90 → 4558.06] Yeah.
[4558.10 → 4558.26] Oh,
[4558.30 → 4561.64] but we could put all these like automatically playing video ads on it.
[4561.68 → 4561.88] I'm like,
[4561.94 → 4566.86] no part of what's great about Linus media group is that it has things that don't have to make money.
[4566.86 → 4569.12] Like LTX for the first three years.
[4569.98 → 4570.54] It's just,
[4570.60 → 4572.32] it's just funded by the
[4572.54 → 4576.22] by the sponsors and by the super chats and by all the other things that we do.
[4576.26 → 4577.12] On the YouTube content.
[4577.46 → 4578.68] So many people ask me,
[4578.72 → 4579.18] they're like,
[4579.60 → 4580.06] uh,
[4580.38 → 4580.78] they're like,
[4580.82 → 4581.04] Hey,
[4581.14 → 4581.32] uh,
[4581.32 → 4581.50] you know,
[4581.50 → 4582.90] what else does Linus media group do?
[4583.28 → 4583.64] Nothing.
[4583.76 → 4586.14] We just make videos and then do stuff that we think is cool.
[4586.28 → 4589.34] And my kids clearly need me to go pay attention to them now.
[4589.44 → 4590.60] So thank you guys for tuning in.
[4590.64 → 4591.52] We'll see you again next week.
[4592.12 → 4592.48] Bye.
[4597.16 → 4597.52] Hey,
[4597.58 → 4597.90] brats.
[4606.26 → 4616.06] All right.
[4616.06 → 4617.86] So I'm ending the YouTube stream now.
[4618.66 → 4618.98] Oh,
[4619.22 → 4619.42] well,
[4619.42 → 4619.98] hold on a second.
[4620.22 → 4620.88] Is that a
[4621.08 → 4624.42] did someone just send a 100 CHF super chat?
[4624.50 → 4625.18] I don't know what this is.
[4625.24 → 4626.10] I've been watching you for years.
[4626.18 → 4626.30] Figure.
[4626.40 → 4626.66] Oh no,
[4626.72 → 4627.64] we already did that one.
[4627.68 → 4627.82] Okay.
[4627.82 → 4628.28] Ending the stream.
[4628.28 → 4628.60] Okay.
[4628.82 → 4629.54] Yeah.
[4638.02 → 4638.66] Okay.
[4638.82 → 4638.92] Here we go.
[4645.38 → 4653.44] Take care.
[4654.16 → 4654.20] You.
