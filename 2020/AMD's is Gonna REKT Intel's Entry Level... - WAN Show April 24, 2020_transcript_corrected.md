[0.00 → 8.82] and we are live welcome ladies and gentlemen to the one the only WAN show actually there's
[8.82 → 14.28] hundreds of them at this point, but that's a minor detail hundreds of WAN shows this one is
[14.28 → 19.14] going to be unique though it'll be different from all the other ones in that this is the first time
[19.14 → 26.22] ever here on the WAN show that I and James have co-hosted it from remote locations together now
[26.22 → 32.28] I have co-hosted with James before, and I have co-hosted remotely with someone other than James
[32.28 → 37.14] before but this combination this is brand new so get ready for something that's unlike anything
[37.14 → 42.24] you've ever seen before James do I have you amped for the show like is that do you feel good do you
[42.24 → 49.62] want to listen to the rest of it do you believe in life after Luke everyone's going to be singing that
[49.62 → 54.60] all weekend now you're welcome oh Lord we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today
[54.60 → 61.62] this one is my personal favourite I was reading an article on the verge yesterday, and I was halfway
[61.62 → 68.10] through it and I realized why was this ever a thing Facebook has apparently killed their pseudo
[68.10 → 74.52] science ad category, so I thought that one was pretty good what do you get James what's your top topic
[74.52 → 79.72] well there's something similar from YouTube where apparently they're going to be just removing videos
[79.72 → 86.74] that contain medically unsubstantiated content, and we also man we have to talk about RTX voice it's so sick
[86.74 → 93.76] it is really cool except for one small rub don't spoil it oh, oh don't spoil it okay all right I won't
[93.76 → 100.54] spoil it, but there's something that you might not know about RTX voice that was my hint it was just a hint
[100.54 → 106.26] it wasn't entirely spoiled right we are still good that was subtle that was subtle all right no I got
[106.26 → 111.40] one more it's four it's four James you got to do four topics each host presents two topics okay these
[111.40 → 119.44] are informal rules, and we do deviate from them from time to time AMD has announced their third gen
[119.44 → 127.06] Ry zen 3 processors and b550 chipset, and I'm really excited about those as well we actually this is one
[127.06 → 130.70] of those weeks when I say we've got a lot of great topics for you guys, and we actually have a lot of
[130.70 → 139.86] great topics for you let's roll that intro oh of course I forgot to set it public on YouTube
[139.86 → 148.48] figures that's fine it's public now it doesn't matter how do I see you instead of me uh I don't know get
[148.48 → 148.76] good
[148.76 → 160.68] the show is brought to you today by plural site and Messi footwear yeah that's right
[160.68 → 169.12] that footwear you wear it on your foot foot here foot oh I love it all right so guys I
[169.12 → 173.86] want to jump right into the headline topic today I actually don't I want to talk about the pseudoscience
[173.86 → 179.84] category but the AMD Ryzen 3 announcement is the one that I put in the title and thumbnail so we're
[179.84 → 184.82] going to go with that one the original article here is well basically everywhere uh tech spot posted
[184.82 → 190.22] about it extreme tech posted about it AMD has announced you know I was starting to think they weren't
[190.22 → 198.04] going to do it Zen 2 launched with Ry zen 5 Ry zen 7 Ry zen 9 and I had thought for quite a while there
[198.04 → 203.40] that AMD was just going to round out the low end of their product lineup with last gen products they
[203.40 → 209.58] were just going to let it be okay look hey you don't have enough for uh for a Ry zen 5 uh third gen well
[209.58 → 216.22] then that's fine why don't you just buy an uh you know Ryzen 5 you know second gen or something
[216.22 → 223.60] along those lines um and so oh hold on a second uh okay I can fix that for you at some point James
[223.60 → 228.06] but it's a lower priority right now I want to I want to get through this topic um so yeah I thought
[228.06 → 233.44] they were just going to do that nope it turns out they have decided to take the same thumb screws
[233.44 → 240.26] that they took to AMD uh to Intel's Core i's Core i's Core i's, and they are applying them to Intel's
[240.26 → 248.58] Core i's so the Ry zen 3 3100 and 3300x these are entry level chips both of them are going to be
[248.58 → 255.36] quad cores with SMT so that means four cores eight threads and 18 legs of total cache both of them
[255.36 → 264.22] get this are coming with support for PCI Express Gen 4 so for a total price of an entry level oh I
[264.22 → 270.24] haven't even gotten into the motherboard yet but for let's just say this for a couple of hundred dollars
[270.24 → 276.44] you are going to be able to get a chip and board that is quad-core PCIe Gen 4 and that is coming in
[276.44 → 284.04] the next little bit here so the Ry zen 3 3100 segment is safe Intel no, no the 3100 is 3.6 gigahertz
[284.04 → 291.52] base 3.9 boost that thing is going to game it's going to game for 99 dollars a hundred bucks and that'll
[291.52 → 301.30] be positioned against the Core i3 9100 f so uh 9100 pay respects' edition uh and the Ry zen 3 30 300x that's
[301.30 → 309.76] going to be 0.2 gigahertz higher base so 3.8 base 4.3 boost that thing is going to really game like you
[309.76 → 317.98] are going to be able to pair that with something like an RTX 2060 um excuse me RTX 2060 super and really
[317.98 → 321.72] get the performance that you're expecting out of that graphics card as long as you're not playing
[321.72 → 327.28] a game that is particularly CPU demanding like there are some games out there that demand a lot
[327.28 → 334.12] of threads even the most don't this is like the um the ultimate fortnight Christmas CPU for
[334.12 → 340.42] your kid or yourself yeah basically you know and not even just fortnight like that's the crazy thing
[340.42 → 346.24] like if you want to play the latest cod game uh if you want to play oh yeah so jams I don't know my uh
[346.24 → 353.72] my camera should be working for you, I actually don't know why that isn't working so uh oh yeah
[353.72 → 358.12] well I don't know yep hopefully that's working can you say something I actually think your
[358.12 → 363.26] audio might have cut out when I was changing things I'm jams am I still here oh yeah you're still there
[363.26 → 370.20] all right cool oh, and you broke up a little bit, but that's okay all right so lets uh let's have a
[370.20 → 375.32] look at if there's anything else for us to really share okay so one area where AMD is actually going to
[375.32 → 383.18] fall a little bit behind on specs here is the core i5 9400f which they're positioning the 3300x against
[383.18 → 391.82] is a six core, so there may be workloads where intel is going to uh come out ahead with that processor but
[391.82 → 399.64] I mean intel's stronghold lately has been gaming and if the 3300x performs anywhere near what I would
[399.64 → 404.38] expect I think it's going to absolutely crush the 9400f when it comes to low-end gaming
[404.38 → 412.92] um with that said um oh, oh and this is interesting okay so we don't actually know for sure what the
[412.92 → 419.62] CCX arrangements of these chips are so CCX's for those who are not familiar are the multiple um like
[419.62 → 427.16] kind of chaplets that AMD puts together to make a processor and depending on how many chaplets you have
[427.16 → 432.20] and how they're interconnected there can be latency disadvantages or advantages depending on the
[432.20 → 440.74] layout, so the rumour is that the 3100 is going to be cheaper because it's a multiple CCX design whereas
[440.74 → 448.66] the 3300x could be a single CCX which could make it fantastic for gaming man this is like this is like
[448.66 → 455.84] going back to like the the know Athlon 2500 plus days right like when you could buy a processor
[455.84 → 461.82] remember this is 99 retail price so at some point in its life cycle it's going to go on sale for you
[461.82 → 467.92] know like 90 bucks in a bundle when you could buy a gaming CPU for under a hundred dollars like that's
[467.92 → 476.26] madness it's exciting it kind of reminds me um I was having a discussion with David during a carpool
[476.26 → 482.78] the other day we were trying to figure out whether um how the next wave of consoles is they're
[482.78 → 490.16] more like pcs yeah that make pc components cheaper or more expensive I argued more expensive but he
[490.16 → 495.90] thought maybe it would push the prices down because it would commoditize everything I don't think there's
[495.90 → 502.52] really a ton of room for the prices to go down a bunch I will okay competition's already high enough
[502.52 → 506.80] it's already a race to the bottom so just the fact that these components will be used up by the
[506.80 → 511.56] console market will just make them more scarce yeah I well I don't think it's going to affect that
[511.56 → 518.48] either so okay, so there are a few factors here, so one is there are the components of a pc that cannot get
[518.48 → 524.14] cheaper um things like hard drives they're not going to get cheaper you know you can these are these
[524.14 → 528.70] are all gigantic companies you know whether it's Seagate or Western Digital that we're talking about
[528.70 → 532.88] these are huge companies they're publicly traded companies we can look at their balance sheets we
[532.88 → 538.80] can see what their profit margins are hard drives not getting cheaper there's just a basic fixed cost
[538.80 → 545.28] associated with these uh these rare earth materials that need to be integrated into a hard drive to make
[545.28 → 551.40] a functioning hard drive no matter what the capacity is um there's you need a motor okay you
[551.40 → 555.70] got to put a motor in there you got to fill it with helium now you know for especially for the high
[555.70 → 561.92] cap stuff, so there's enough competition that I just don't think it's uh it's going anywhere and
[561.92 → 567.64] hard drives are under siege not just from alternate hard drive vendors um of which there are few enough
[567.64 → 572.66] now that it would be pretty easy for them to just kind of go okay let's just switch up the business
[572.66 → 576.56] we're going to go cartel style, and we're going to price fix and make sure that we can make some margin
[576.56 → 581.68] but they're also under siege from solid state drive makers who continue to push prices lower and lower and
[581.68 → 587.00] lower so yeah hard drives not happening solid state drives for that matter it's not it's not getting
[587.00 → 594.34] cheaper it's already pretty much a commodity item at this point however there are areas where there is
[594.34 → 601.04] room for things to get cheaper I mean for an unrelated video I was actually looking at intel's gross margins
[601.04 → 607.34] earlier this week, and they're somewhere in the neighbourhood of like 60 plus percent so if you look at it
[607.34 → 615.26] and go okay could an Intel Core i5 you know whatever 250 or so processor all of a sudden be available for
[615.26 → 620.78] 200 bucks yeah that's conceivable I doubt that they would go that aggressive especially because
[620.78 → 627.26] just because intel's margins overall are 60 plus percent doesn't mean that they're actually making 60
[627.26 → 633.38] plus percent on that product that's in the grand scheme of intel's product stack that's a low-end product
[633.38 → 640.02] and that's not where they're making the margin is that margin uh unique to intel in the industry or
[640.02 → 645.96] now is that what you expect to see yeah because in that industry they have such heavy upfront capital
[645.96 → 651.22] expenditures for building these fabs and for researching the next generation of technology
[651.22 → 655.92] that they're going to launch subsequently like way down the road so I think it's a little misleading
[655.92 → 662.56] where there is room for your pc to get a little bit cheaper I would say is in your GPU uh NVIDIA
[662.56 → 670.32] also enjoys these healthy you know 60 plus percent gross margins except that all the NVIDIA does by
[670.32 → 675.92] comparison to at least I mean I'm not saying NVIDIA doesn't invest in and they absolutely do but they
[675.92 → 682.80] don't build fabs so NVIDIA gets to take advantage of TSMC's fab building process, and they just have to
[682.80 → 691.28] design the chip and make it work on TSMC's node so um I think NVIDIA could probably you know drop
[691.28 → 696.40] their price if they felt like the next gen consoles were you know taking a chunk out of their business
[696.40 → 701.28] and they could because they're all going to be powered by AMD there's going to be no NVIDIA GPUs
[701.28 → 706.40] and oh actually okay I don't know it's possible that like a Nintendo successor could be NVIDIA powered
[706.40 → 712.48] the current one is I forgot about that is anyone talking about that uh yeah people have talked about it
[712.48 → 719.36] yeah how both Microsoft and Sony are AMD camps and then Nintendo sort of randomly went NVIDIA this
[719.36 → 725.12] time around uh just because they wanted that uh well basically I mean the switch just is a NVIDIA
[725.12 → 732.88] shield tablet like if you I mean obviously a better one a heavily modified one an improved one but you
[732.88 → 738.72] know it basically takes that concept of a tablet that you can game with on the go and then dock when you
[738.72 → 746.56] want a game on your TV, and it's like oink that's mine now I'm going to steal this meme you know um
[747.68 → 754.64] so yeah there is room for your pc to get cheaper but I don't expect the upcoming consoles to really put
[755.28 → 761.76] much in the way of pressure on that um you know it's their going to occupy the low end of the
[761.76 → 768.64] market you know anywhere from 400 to 500 where generally speaking manufacturers are already
[768.64 → 773.28] taking as little profit as they can in order to uh just do the volume of business that they need to
[773.28 → 779.12] do I mean that's something a lot of consumers don't really understand is that manufacturers in
[779.12 → 786.24] order to even uh you know meet the production quotas that they've had to commit to in order to build
[786.24 → 791.92] their high-end profitable products will sometimes have to pump out low-end products that they don't
[791.92 → 797.44] make any money on or that they even lose money on so that they don't lose their contracts for example
[797.44 → 803.12] or so that they don't have to lay off the staff that they need to make those juicy products or to
[803.12 → 807.20] justify the lease that they have on this giant building or whatever the case may be there is an
[807.20 → 813.84] incentive for manufacturers to keep up their volumes I mean there's other there are other factors that are
[813.84 → 818.96] just financial too uh sometimes companies for whatever reason I've never really subscribed to
[818.96 → 824.16] this and I remember getting in arguments at my old job for some reason companies feel the need to
[824.72 → 833.36] like measure based on how high their top line revenue is and that seems to determine the like you
[833.36 → 838.32] know the valuation of this company to lenders for example like oh we're a billion-dollar company
[838.32 → 843.04] it's like oh well what was your what was your net profit I don't know like you know who cares we're a
[843.04 → 850.08] billion dollar company right well no hold on you know to me, you know net profit was always
[850.08 → 854.88] far more important than what kind of top line revenue we're doing but that is a factor in some
[854.88 → 859.76] corporate cultures I remember at my old job uh we would get we would get pushed the product management
[859.76 → 864.88] team would get pushed to hit these crazy you know revenue goals like oh everyone's going to get a bonus
[864.88 → 870.24] if we do a million dollars revenue in one day, and we'd look at that, and we'd go well like yeah I can do
[870.24 → 875.12] a million dollars revenue in one day all I need to do is sell extreme editions for 500 bucks, and we'll
[875.12 → 881.36] get there just like lickety-split right I'll lose a bunch of money like no one's going to get paid but we
[881.36 → 885.92] can do a million dollars revenue in one day if that makes you feel like you're bigger right so well i
[885.92 → 890.00] think there 's's also pressure especially when you're a publicly traded company to keep that stock
[890.00 → 894.56] price high because that's how you secure additional financing and everyone who's giving you funds
[895.20 → 898.56] they're doing in exchange for shares so they want those shares to be worth a lot so
[900.00 → 906.24] exactly more important it's yet another way that modern businesses seem to get incentivized to do
[906.24 → 913.52] the wrong things in the name of making the business better um and that can harm them the long
[913.52 → 918.00] term i was reading a fascinating article about Rolex of all things I'm not a watch guy I'm not
[918.00 → 925.52] into watches but um it was an article that was about how Rolex continues to innovate and again
[925.52 → 932.48] as not a watch guy i kind of look at a watch and I go sorry innovate what it either knows
[932.48 → 937.52] what time it is, or it doesn't and i I thought we pretty much nailed that down a couple of hundred years
[937.52 → 944.56] ago so what exactly is the remaining innovation and so if you know talked about you know what that
[944.56 → 948.64] innovation might actually mean which was very helpful background information for somebody like
[948.64 → 954.72] me reading the article, but it talked about how the way that Rolex was originally structured their
[954.72 → 963.12] corporate structure was designed so that it would, it could basically continue perpetually without
[963.12 → 972.56] ever being beholden to any kind of shareholders um and so all their revenue numbers sales figures
[972.56 → 981.84] um design nobody knows anything about the internal workings of Rolex effectively and that's allowed
[981.84 → 987.04] them, and they're not accountable to anyone so by not having to do a quarterly earnings call or any of that
[987.04 → 995.20] goofy stuff they can make big bets they can do stuff that might be against the conventional wisdom and
[995.20 → 1000.96] just do what they think is right and I'm like oh that actually makes so much sense to me because
[1000.96 → 1007.44] that's one of the big reasons that Linus media group has never solicited any kind of outside um you
[1007.44 → 1012.56] know shareholders or anything like that because as much as there might have been times that we could
[1012.56 → 1017.20] have used the money and with our public profile there's no doubt that we could raise a bunch of
[1017.20 → 1022.48] money if we wanted to i I just don't want to be accountable to anyone else if I want to make a crazy
[1022.48 → 1030.40] decision like you know we're going to abandon tech videos, and we're going to move into you know all
[1030.40 → 1037.60] toys and games videos on channel super fun as long as I've got my team onboard my staff's like okay
[1037.60 → 1044.40] you know I guess you haven't really led us astray so far let's give it a shot I want to be able to do
[1044.40 → 1049.44] that and even though I could maintain you know 51 ownership or something like that and make
[1049.44 → 1056.80] unilateral decisions you know I always feel like even if you know by law I'm not accountable to my
[1056.80 → 1062.88] shareholders by sort of um I don't know what the word would be ethics is that the word I'm looking
[1062.88 → 1069.84] for just integrity like mores i I feel like i I should care and that should be a team decision if
[1069.84 → 1072.72] there's other people who have a vested stake in the company
[1076.16 → 1081.68] so yeah i just I forget how I got on this topic but I thought that was cool and i and I respect it
[1081.68 → 1087.52] pretty much yeah like if we need to raise money we'll just issue a cryptocurrency or something yeah
[1087.52 → 1092.32] you know what's funny is we we had thought about doing it we and we had even like said on
[1092.32 → 1097.04] when we were like yeah we're totally going to do it we're going to do we're going to do Linus coin um but the
[1097.04 → 1103.76] further we got into the weeds on it the more we realized that um there's really no way to do it and
[1103.76 → 1109.68] make money without screwing over someone else so we were like oh all right well that explains why
[1109.68 → 1118.48] everyone's doing this uh yeah neat uh so, so yeah I'm out I'm out you want to talk about this Facebook
[1118.48 → 1124.16] thing uh no, no I want to talk about the other part of the one two punch to intel's low end
[1126.00 → 1132.96] so this is really cool the b550 finally appears it's been long rumoured, but it looks like we are getting
[1132.96 → 1140.48] an entry-level chipset to accompany these dozen 3 processors, and it's actually better than I expected
[1140.48 → 1146.56] so it's going to have uh compared to x570 it's going to have oh rumours never mind these are rumours little
[1146.56 → 1153.20] further info has been suggested other than PCI gen 3 or gen 4 um all right so apparently it will feature
[1153.20 → 1159.76] fewer USB 3.2 gen 2 whatever that is I think that's 10 gigs and SATA ports and will communicate with
[1159.76 → 1168.40] the CPU via a PCIE gen 3 link okay uh so that means with 20 usable PCIE 4.0 lanes on the CPU you'd
[1168.40 → 1173.76] still get gen 4 speeds on your main 16x slot switch to your graphics card and a secondary x4 which would
[1173.76 → 1180.16] probably be m.2 and then everything else would be you know slower so if you had to if you wanted to put
[1180.16 → 1186.08] like 10 gigabit networking on a b550 board for whatever reason because you're crazy uh you know that
[1186.08 → 1192.32] could end up bottlenecked if the user also was you know writing data from that interface to an m.2 SSD
[1192.32 → 1199.04] that was on a gen 3 link on there as well um so this is exciting ladies and gentlemen uh you
[1199.04 → 1203.92] know it's it is opens up a lot of chances for us to do some really cool builds like you know hey we
[1203.92 → 1211.60] did a 400 gaming machine that's actually really great and really competitive um like if I'm is I'm Sony or
[1211.60 → 1217.84] or Microsoft you know I'm I'm looking at this going like come on AMD we're trying to sell these
[1217.84 → 1222.72] these uh you know cheap processors in our game console why you have to just give them to everyone
[1222.72 → 1230.72] like this but hey it's good for us, I love it I love it all right jams bring us into this topic
[1230.72 → 1234.16] because i I really want to talk about it do you want to do you want to do the rundown through this one
[1234.16 → 1242.72] i I will hold my peace I'll, i will say nothing okay so it came to the attention of this uh
[1243.52 → 1248.00] I guess uh a website news website that I don't know it's called the markup, but they did this
[1248.00 → 1255.20] investigation where they made their own ads uh using this category of ad targeting that you
[1255.20 → 1260.80] can use when you make an ad on Facebook you can naturally uh target it at specific uh psychographics
[1260.80 → 1265.04] and stuff that Facebook has and that's why oh advertising on Google or Facebook is so awesome
[1265.04 → 1270.08] okay I promised I wouldn't say anything but jams you've actually done some advertising for us
[1270.08 → 1276.88] on Google and Facebook right yeah, yeah so can you talk about like for people who don't know like i
[1276.88 → 1282.08] actually don't even know that much about it can you talk us through how you create like a targeted ad
[1282.08 → 1290.24] in the first place um well there are a couple different types like on some platforms there's
[1290.24 → 1296.08] just boosted posts, so any post like any video you upload to YouTube or any um post that you make on
[1296.08 → 1302.32] Instagram or Facebook you could just boost, so then that's why you get that little promoted box underneath
[1302.32 → 1306.08] it, and it just gets put in front of other people who aren't on your friends list or whatever
[1306.08 → 1311.68] um but I think you can also just make straight up ads that are going to apply to like the sidebar
[1311.68 → 1316.48] on the desktop for example um and when you're making those types of things you can choose
[1317.12 → 1321.68] which kind of geographic range you want them to be served to so I only want people in Kansas to see
[1321.68 → 1326.72] this political ad for example and then there are all sorts of psychographics and demographics so
[1326.72 → 1334.08] i it should be women between the ages of 30 and 50 who like now here's where it comes it gets really
[1334.08 → 1343.04] interesting who like um exercise pants and also uh messy shoes and so those are the targeting
[1343.04 → 1348.56] categories that we're talking about here where this organization the markup discovered that there was a
[1349.12 → 1355.04] targeting category for pseudoscience people who like pseudoscience, and they created their own ads
[1355.04 → 1360.88] and boosted posts on Instagram and Facebook to target these people and the ad got approved and so then
[1360.88 → 1366.00] they reached out to Facebook uh multiple people at Facebook waited and waited and finally got
[1366.00 → 1372.24] a response and the response that they got just said uh we removed the targeting category we removed
[1372.24 → 1379.12] pseudoscience as a category uh and I think the reason that they did that so promptly is that they had
[1379.12 → 1384.32] experience doing this before for years now I think pseudoscience has been a category for like six years or
[1384.32 → 1388.88] something, and they've had other categories that were that they've had to remove before including
[1388.88 → 1394.72] um vaccine controversies people who are interested in vaccine controversies chem trail conspiracy theory
[1395.52 → 1402.08] and in fact I also have in the notes here Jew hater and history of why Jews ruin the world
[1402.08 → 1410.16] so wow clearly wait shut up it was I actually haven't read through the notes that was an advertising
[1410.72 → 1418.40] targeting category on Facebook that's right so what that says to me wow there's no one working at
[1418.40 → 1423.04] Facebook who's saying hey you know we notice a lot of users are searching this stuff let's make this
[1423.04 → 1427.68] a category no human is doing that it must be algorithmic right this is based on what people
[1427.68 → 1432.32] are typing in or based on the titles of things they're clicking on or something so to me, it looks
[1432.32 → 1437.84] like programmatically pseudoscience, although pseudoscience isn't a word that someone would put in
[1437.84 → 1443.52] their own yeah content I don't buy it so that's weird yeah I don't buy it if I'm is I'm interested in
[1443.52 → 1451.20] pseudoscience I think I've been profiled as someone who is interested in pseudoscience I don't acknowledge
[1451.20 → 1457.92] that because i if I'm someone who buys into pseudoscience I don't know that pseudo like guys it's
[1457.92 → 1464.64] right in the name pseudo means fake I mean fake science they even make science like even if you
[1464.64 → 1470.48] think of it as alternative you're not going to use the word you would never use that exactly you think
[1470.48 → 1476.16] like someone who's pro-choice calling themselves pro-abortion or like pro-killing babies
[1476.16 → 1480.80] or something like that like you're using the other side's terminology to describe your own position
[1480.80 → 1489.04] that it's not how it happens so if I'm into pseudoscience I'm into alternative medicine or I'm into
[1489.60 → 1495.52] you know uh integrated health yeah I'm at the I'm at the next level right like I think I've I think I'm
[1495.52 → 1504.48] I'm above it, I'm past it um so the fact that they have a pseudoscience category to me indicates exactly
[1504.48 → 1511.12] the opposite that this is 100 intentional, and they're taking these gullible people who don't
[1511.12 → 1516.32] understand the scientific method you know the kinds of people that'll say believing in science is no
[1516.32 → 1522.00] different from believing in anything else because you're just believing something that you can't that
[1522.00 → 1527.28] that isn't you know 100 correct it's like yeah but the the the the thing behind the
[1527.28 → 1532.24] thing about science is that it's the pursuit of knowledge we know it isn't perfect that's the
[1532.24 → 1539.52] whole point and that's no dogma yes there's no easy answer but the thing that sucks about science is
[1539.52 → 1546.08] that you can never prove that something doesn't exist I can never prove that cows with red polka dots
[1546.08 → 1551.12] don't exist i just we have they haven't been observed, so there's no reason that they do exist
[1552.00 → 1558.56] oh yeah but that okay that gets into a much much deeper sort of conversation um so
[1559.84 → 1568.80] tell me this i I'm going to have real talk real conversation here is this the most blatantly evil
[1568.80 → 1575.92] thing you've seen out of Facebook so far intentionally creating a category that allows you to target
[1575.92 → 1582.96] people who you know are gullible and vulnerable to believing things that simply have no proof that
[1582.96 → 1591.60] they are true and in fact may be well known to be not true well it's interesting because they're doing
[1591.60 → 1596.88] this simultaneously like this is all in the context of covid and simultaneously as this is happening
[1596.88 → 1601.92] other parts of the business including the CEO Zuckerberg are making all these other efforts and
[1601.92 → 1607.76] announcements and things they're implementing that are the exact opposite of this you know since
[1607.76 → 1612.32] the um camera giant analytical thing and maybe even before they've been so focused on trying to have
[1612.32 → 1620.08] truth on the platform and try to reduce the amount of camping from a PR perspective okay sure yes
[1620.08 → 1627.60] all right sure like on the 16th of April uh Zuckerberg said that Facebook had they added warning labels on 40
[1627.60 → 1634.80] million posts related to covet 19 um they have this other thing where like if you had engaged with
[1634.80 → 1641.12] a post that was known to be unsubstantiated related to covid they like gave you a notification telling
[1641.12 → 1645.84] you that, and you could click through and go to the World Health Organization's website for information
[1645.84 → 1651.28] so parts of the business are trying but is it just the fact is are they a hydra and some of the heads
[1651.28 → 1657.60] don't talk to other heads it kind of priorities it kind of looks that way doesn't it because like i
[1658.88 → 1666.16] I okay you know what no I don't think they're a hydra I think that someone at some point who is
[1666.16 → 1672.16] aware of these you know positive initiatives has to be also aware of pseudoscience as a freaking
[1672.16 → 1678.64] targeted category on the platform like there's no way because okay the thing is if you're working on
[1678.64 → 1684.64] truth on the platform right you're looking at organic posts so you know whatever Linda or
[1684.64 → 1689.12] Karen posted in their you know mom group or whatever you're looking at that kind of stuff
[1689.12 → 1694.96] but you're also looking at boosted posts so organic posts or seemingly organic posts that have been
[1694.96 → 1699.68] given a little kick in the butt, and then you're also looking at advertising posts right because all of
[1699.68 → 1706.32] that is part of that transparency and fact uh on the platform sort of initiative that they're that
[1706.32 → 1714.48] they're supposedly working on right so as soon as you encountered an ad right that that was obviously
[1714.48 → 1720.88] false i i I'm imagining what Facebook's internal you know interface looks like it's probably not garbage
[1720.88 → 1727.76] given that they are a know web development company so probably when I click on that post there's
[1727.76 → 1733.44] something akin to the uh like the business manager interface that we've got for managing our own like
[1733.44 → 1740.08] uh boosted or advertising posts that say what categories this post was intended to target
[1740.72 → 1747.20] so yeah but Linus that information is exposed to Facebook users now you can do that you can click on
[1747.20 → 1753.36] an ad and say why am I seeing this, and it'll say you were selected as part of the pseudoscience category
[1753.36 → 1759.36] exactly so the user can see that so it can't, it's not a big secret so I don't buy the hydra argument
[1759.36 → 1764.72] then there's no way that these guys working on the positive initiatives couldn't have noticed this
[1764.72 → 1770.32] so I think it's just as simple as they want to have their cake and eat it too they want to they want to
[1770.32 → 1778.64] talk about how they care about people getting you know real evidence-based information, but they want to make
[1778.64 → 1783.76] money on people peddling nonsense on the back end I think it's that simple
[1783.76 → 1790.72] it's gross this whole theory is based on the fact that you and I can't figure out how
[1790.72 → 1795.52] this category was labelled the way it's labelled, so there could be an easy explanation for that we're
[1795.52 → 1802.40] just not thinking of yeah maybe I mean AI AI tools you know they're getting they're getting pretty good
[1802.40 → 1811.52] maybe they managed to to to maybe the AI managed to label it on its own, but that is just that is just
[1811.52 → 1820.00] brutal ah maybe you have to imagine that like the graph is so huge the graph meaning like the network
[1820.00 → 1826.72] and like how many different categories there are and how many each user falls into its so
[1826.72 → 1833.28] like unfound ably large that there's by and large there's no human like putting all the balls into
[1833.28 → 1839.20] different buckets it has to be happening programmatically no I just think so I agree with you there but i just
[1839.20 → 1846.88] also think that if they were making an earnest and honest effort to remove pseudoscience from their
[1846.88 → 1854.32] platform somebody working on one of those initiatives would have seen this just naturally seen this before
[1854.32 → 1860.32] a third party reported it to them, I just don't buy that have you seen uh have you ever scrolled through
[1860.32 → 1868.48] Facebook and seen someone's post have that flag over it that says it's fake news um no I haven't it's so
[1868.48 → 1873.76] sweet yeah yeah my wife showed me the other day she was scrolling through and one of those like you
[1873.76 → 1879.52] know those people you have on your Facebook who just post stupid crap and that you read
[1879.52 → 1884.40] and you just think it's ignorant yeah that person posting that kind of thing, and it just had like a
[1884.40 → 1890.48] superimposed on top of it there's a banner covering the content of the meme being like this meme has been
[1890.48 → 1894.80] shown to be inaccurate, and then you can click through and like learn about why it brings you to like a fact
[1894.80 → 1900.08] check third party site something akin to snopes.com right, and you can just read about why it's inaccurate
[1900.08 → 1905.92] oh that's great, and it's kind of like socially it's like a slap in the face like if you post stuff that
[1905.92 → 1912.16] gets those banners on if it's like so shameful I'd be ashamed i yeah, but you would be ashamed, but that's
[1912.16 → 1916.16] exactly the difference is I think a lot of the people who post that kind of stuff don't understand why
[1916.16 → 1921.52] they should feel ashamed uh like they think they're on another level right, or they double down a lot of
[1921.52 → 1925.44] people just double down you dig in your heels, and it just makes you more dedicated to the tribe you're
[1925.44 → 1933.04] in because the man or the media is keeping you down whoever the opponent is okay IAN viscera says
[1934.24 → 1941.04] for sakes pseudoscience is theoretical science as in proven via scientific results but goes against
[1941.04 → 1945.44] the current acknowledged system so if you counter e equals MC squared and prove it with science it's
[1945.44 → 1957.84] labelled pseudoscience IAN no pseudo means adjective not genuine spurious or sham pseudoscience is not real
[1957.84 → 1969.12] science by the very definition of pseudoscience like no that's not how it works well I mean there is uh
[1969.68 → 1975.12] there are things like entrance to science things that are uh kind of like under review that are not
[1975.12 → 1979.76] part of the canon, yet that like just need more testing there are hypotheses that need to yes
[1980.32 → 1985.20] the difference between a hypothesis and a theory one of them or the difference sorry between a theory
[1985.20 → 1990.64] and a law one of them is just the test of time like the law of gravity for example like we just
[1991.28 → 1996.32] it's just stood for so long that it's its part of the canon so maybe he's referring to some stuff like that
[1996.32 → 2003.04] that's quite possible um all right so let's move on to our next topic which is actually kind of related
[2003.04 → 2010.08] uh, so this was originally posted on BBC actually CNN's got an article about it as well so YouTube
[2010.08 → 2016.96] has apparently banned medically unsubstantiated content so they deleted some videos uh earlier this
[2016.96 → 2023.84] month that linked coronavirus to 5g and uh YouTube CEO said in an interview with CNN this week that
[2023.84 → 2031.20] YouTube would be removing information that is problematic that is one heck of a quote YouTube
[2031.20 → 2038.16] man google you guys just have this way of like taking something that you're doing that might not
[2038.16 → 2048.08] be the end of the world or horrible and being so cagey and like well you know weird and evil about
[2048.08 → 2053.76] it that it makes it seem really, really bad, and it opens up I love that she left the door open for it
[2053.76 → 2058.56] to be terrible well the quote looks terrible and that's kind of part of the reason I put it in
[2058.56 → 2064.88] here um because it's like whoa well who's who decides and in this case this was taken from
[2064.88 → 2070.56] an interview not a press release yeah not a verbiage of a new terms of service so it's just like
[2071.44 → 2076.80] you know she's kind of stammering she's she's doing a list um this is just what ended up coming
[2076.80 → 2082.00] out of her mouth during this interview so I don't think the sky is falling, but it also tells you
[2082.00 → 2089.20] know where the mindset is at right like they've they've talked about you know um elevating
[2089.20 → 2096.72] authoritative voices which is another way of saying you know pushing down uh non-authoritative voices
[2096.72 → 2103.20] right like you can't elevate on a platform like YouTube there's a fixed number of spots to promote
[2103.20 → 2107.84] content right it's its finite it depends on how many users there are and how long they're on the
[2107.84 → 2114.48] site and how many of those spots they encounter so it's its it's a finite resource so by elevating
[2115.12 → 2121.44] uh sources that they consider to be accurate you are inherently decelerating what would be the
[2121.44 → 2129.84] opposite of elevating help me out here jams you're usually my my my uh lowering lower diminishing
[2129.84 → 2134.24] dang it diminishing sure let's go with diminishing you are diminishing the exposure of anything that
[2134.24 → 2140.32] you don't consider to be trustworthy um with that said I don't necessarily disagree with
[2140.32 → 2146.32] what they've defined as problematic here so anything that is medically unsubstantiated or anything going
[2146.32 → 2152.40] against the World Health Organization recommendations and there has been some backlash against who in
[2152.40 → 2159.20] the last little bit but I don't think any of it has been around um their recommendations in terms of you
[2159.20 → 2163.60] know how diseases are transmitted and some of the basic stuff it seems to be more
[2163.60 → 2171.52] uh the politics and the culture of the World Health Organization and uh you know not necessarily
[2171.52 → 2177.76] their recommendations with respect to social distancing and stuff like that um she added that
[2177.76 → 2183.44] we do remove across YouTube in non-pandemic times information that is in violation of our policy
[2183.44 → 2187.84] and they have been continually updating their policy as the virus situation changes which led to the
[2187.84 → 2195.44] removal of the 5g content for example so what's your take on that should they allow videos suggesting
[2195.44 → 2202.48] that people inject disinfectant into their bodies for example you've been following that right now part
[2203.12 → 2209.20] part of me is kind of like natural selection baby okay you can't say that you can't say that on the
[2209.20 → 2217.68] wet show awkward uh uh uh well, and it's all it's also just not it's also just not true because those
[2217.68 → 2221.20] people like even that natural selection argument's just not true because those people are just going
[2221.20 → 2227.12] to be burdens on the healthcare system, and it's going to hurt other people so yes um, but they've made
[2227.12 → 2231.84] something very dangerous and people thought this uh with when the Gutenberg press was invented just for
[2231.84 → 2237.60] uh so that anybody could just print a book it's the same thing you's your greatest gift and your greatest curse
[2238.40 → 2242.72] now uh knowledge is distributed, so anybody can make it and consume it and when you're making
[2243.68 → 2247.52] you know if you're making a video you can sound like an expert because there's no one there to contest
[2247.52 → 2252.72] you at the time so it's pretty dangerous, so some moderation has to happen, and that moderation has
[2252.72 → 2257.76] to happen from a centralized source so it's just always going to be problematic, but then you open
[2257.76 → 2263.28] yourself up to new problems right because as soon as you allow a central source to you know determine
[2263.28 → 2268.32] what is true and what is not at the end of the day you might and i I could see this argument being
[2268.32 → 2276.24] made you might end up throwing out the baby with the bath water um yeah man I don't know and guys okay
[2276.24 → 2282.48] imagine there's just imagine that if 5g is related to covet if that happened yes they would anarchy
[2284.16 → 2288.88] they're pretty sure it's not though so I think they're being around like we're going to remove things
[2288.88 → 2294.88] that are just blatantly poisonous yes uh we've got some people saying you know raw raw raw natural
[2294.88 → 2301.60] selection uh Darwin awards okay guys for real though like there is that's not natural selection
[2301.60 → 2309.92] actually that's that's a societal problem that people do not have the proper education and the
[2309.92 → 2317.12] skills that they need to ferret out untruths and when they're reading or consuming media um that's that's
[2317.12 → 2322.80] not natural selection that doesn't mean that they are somehow lesser that just means that for whatever
[2322.80 → 2329.20] reason they were not given access to the skills whether it was a cultural issue or whatever the
[2329.20 → 2334.32] case may be so you can't just go like oh yeah you know anyone dumb enough to believe that they should
[2334.32 → 2340.80] just let them all inject disinfectant into themselves um because that's really not fair like we could miss out
[2340.80 → 2346.96] on the next Isaac Newton or the next Einstein because no one ever bothered to teach
[2346.96 → 2352.48] them you know the actual function of disinfectant and how it does not actually work from inside the
[2352.48 → 2355.84] body or rather that it does work from inside the body which is exactly the problem
[2359.92 → 2364.00] I think we should do the sponsors yeah let's do the sponsors let's do them hard
[2366.40 → 2372.08] the show is also brought to you by plural site is a skill development platform with 7 000
[2372.08 → 2378.16] expert-led video courses topics include JavaScript python c sharp I'm sure that's a typo I'm sure
[2378.16 → 2387.36] they meant c sharp and more that's got to be golder Jane c sharp love it uh and more and plural site
[2387.36 → 2393.04] makes it easy especially in a time like this to stay at home and level up your skills it's free for
[2393.04 → 2398.32] the month of April so go check it out at the link in the video description which oops is supposed to be on
[2398.32 → 2404.88] top of jams there you go so get plural site for free during April 2020 level up your skills now who
[2404.88 → 2410.16] knows by the time we all get back to work like normal you might be doing a different job if you
[2410.16 → 2419.28] level up enough and the show is brought to you by verse footwear starting at 95 dollars hold on
[2419.28 → 2428.08] they're both going to do it hey oh you've got the shoe in water okay you levelled up your footwear
[2428.08 → 2435.04] your footwear shilling skills so verse makes the 100 waterproof shoe that's great for walking through
[2435.04 → 2440.24] rain snow mud and slush without worry their demoted material regulates the temperature of your feet
[2440.24 → 2445.52] so on hot days it'll keep you cool and on cool days it'll keep you warm and verse shoes are flexible
[2445.52 → 2450.16] and stretchy which are kind of two ways of saying the same thing making it almost feel like a second
[2450.16 → 2455.52] pair of socks they're one of the lightest sneakers in the world at just 175 grams that's about the
[2455.52 → 2461.68] weight of an iPhone and their herringbone tread pattern is designed to uh grip just about anything
[2461.68 → 2465.68] you walk on making them great for hikes you can actually see I've been that's actually way lighter
[2466.80 → 2473.84] way lighter than some iPhones yes it is the 11 pro max is like 250 206 grams or something yeah I've been uh
[2473.84 → 2477.76] I've been super, super happy with these I've actually been wearing shoes lately you'd be proud of me
[2478.96 → 2482.64] I've been wearing my uh my verse shoes although I don't know that I'm using them for what they
[2482.64 → 2487.84] intended you can actually see the wear pattern is really weird on them see that the black is basically
[2487.84 → 2494.80] not worn at all and same with the heel and then the middle is like beat up to crap uh that's because
[2494.80 → 2502.32] um I've been using them on my bike rides I actually got a bike nice that's my that's my leg day now so uh
[2502.32 → 2507.76] my son got a bike and I got one, and we've been going ripping around I just load the I load the girls in the trailer
[2508.24 → 2512.24] so that's about between the girls and the trailer it's about 150 pounds
[2512.88 → 2519.44] and then we go kind of at his pace but I'm hauling 150 pounds with me, and it's been just a fantastic
[2519.68 → 2525.60] fantastic workout, and you should never ride a bike with sandals because uh my dad actually
[2525.60 → 2531.60] was the reason that I will never get on a bicycle with anything other than closed toed shoes as
[2531.60 → 2539.36] as hardcore as I am on the sandal bandwagon because his big toe was like mangled he got it caught in the
[2539.36 → 2546.32] chain when he was a kid, and it was just like it was weird it was like split it like had like a peak on it
[2546.32 → 2553.60] down the middle of the toenail really gross um anyway uh yeah Messi great guys donating surgical
[2553.60 → 2558.24] masks sneakers and all that kind of good stuff to local heroes you can choose what you pay starting
[2558.24 → 2563.52] at 95 and up and the higher the price the more Messi can donate go to Messi footwear.com
[2564.16 → 2570.48] Linus tech tips to learn more so yeah yeah that's why I will never get on a bicycle without my Messi my
[2570.48 → 2578.64] Messi shoes oh, oh wait I've got one more chiliastic thing for you guys lttstore.com sucks
[2578.64 → 2585.20] we have launched this is going to be exciting you guys are going to love it all right we have launched
[2585.20 → 2591.36] a shipping promo for our US viewers that is going to cost us a lot of money we are shipping out of
[2591.36 → 2598.88] Canada, but we are still offering 4.99 flat rate shipping across the US this weekend now through
[2598.88 → 2606.96] Sunday 11 59 pm pacific so go check it out if you were waiting to place an order on lttstore.com
[2606.96 → 2611.92] and you're in the US now is the time to do it I actually don't know if it's all I can't imagine
[2611.92 → 2617.44] we're shipping to Alaska at that rate I have no idea uh if there's any Alaskans in the uh in the chat
[2617.44 → 2622.40] guys let me know if your region is qualifying for the shipping here but go check it out we've got water
[2622.40 → 2628.40] bottles we've got stealth hoodies we've got t-shirts galore and there's actually one more LTT store related
[2628.40 → 2634.24] thing I'm going to post this in the chat here, but we've created a straw poll it looks like we are
[2634.24 → 2639.28] running out of things that really need to be 3d printed a lot of the stuff that the frontline
[2639.28 → 2645.20] workers need is moving to injection moulding which is faster and more efficient than 3d printing so
[2646.00 → 2651.12] uh 3d printing stuff might not be a practical way to help with the effort so we've created a straw poll
[2651.12 → 2656.64] here I'm going to go ahead and wow the YouTube chat moves so fast that I doubt you guys are even going
[2656.64 → 2661.44] to get a chance to click those links I'm going to drop out of the cms here on float plane drop that
[2661.44 → 2666.96] in the chat, and we want you guys to tell us line workers how we should use the rest of the
[2666.96 → 2674.56] funds that we collected um through selling the folding at home shirt because we for on purpose
[2674.56 → 2679.92] basically intentionally we did not commit to a particular use for them because we wanted to be
[2679.92 → 2687.12] able to do whatever is the most useful thing so uh we're going to leave it up to you guys i I fired
[2687.12 → 2692.32] up that straw poll there guys make sure you vote and let us know what you want us to do with the extra
[2692.32 → 2698.32] money that we raised with the folding at home shirt so just a reminder um the proceeds so that is
[2698.32 → 2705.36] after the cost of the shirts and after uh printing um the proceeds uh for the folding shirt that we sold a
[2705.36 → 2711.84] few weeks ago um those are going to help covid causes, but you know now that um you know our
[2711.84 → 2716.96] usefulness there is limited we want to we want to know uh what you guys want so, so far direct relief
[2716.96 → 2723.76] for homeless and shelters is leading uh bc children's hospital no one likes sick kids or that came across
[2723.76 → 2730.72] wrong no one likes kids being sick um I think that's a good one food bank is in number three uh Canadian
[2730.72 → 2735.52] red cross is number four meals on wheels is number five and just because something wins doesn't mean
[2735.52 → 2742.00] that everything will necessarily go there what we could do is we could just split it up um that
[2742.00 → 2746.08] that might be a cool way to do it and just you know that way the food bank gets 21 of the funds even
[2746.08 → 2753.12] if they didn't win you know so uh just want to like shout you guys out because we raised like over 40 grand
[2753.12 → 2758.48] um so whatever you the thing you guys are voting on right now matters a lot and every vote counts
[2758.48 → 2764.16] especially if we do decide to divvy it up according to proportions so just huge shout out to you
[2764.16 → 2770.08] guys thank you so much and just while we're at it shout out to intel for matching um they actually
[2770.08 → 2775.52] matched our donation up to I believe it was 40 grand uh and they contributed that directly to
[2775.52 → 2779.92] the folding at home project so it was a really, really big push from our community, and we're really proud
[2780.96 → 2788.00] uh okay nick light confirms it is everywhere in the U.S. uh okay then well um wow
[2788.48 → 2797.20] I really hope that that works out okay neat let's move on okay oh that could get really expensive
[2797.76 → 2805.20] okay rtx voice was big news this week did you try it jams I didn't try it myself but I was
[2805.20 → 2809.68] involved in Alex's video and i have to say this is the type of thing you know when you hear about a new
[2809.68 → 2815.84] technology and your imagination imagines like the best way it could be and then when it actually comes out
[2815.84 → 2821.44] it's yeah the opposite of that it's like tech news is so cool and then tech is always like uh it's
[2821.44 → 2825.60] okay I have to wait another three years before it does what I want it to do this was like promise
[2825.60 → 2830.24] delivered I was like oh that that would be cool in concept, and then it's actually like exceeding
[2830.24 → 2835.76] everyone's expectations it's so awesome yeah like that that short circuit video even though it went up
[2835.76 → 2845.68] like two or three days ago has like 675 000 views 50 000 upvotes people are jazzed about RTX voice and
[2845.68 → 2852.16] the coolest thing about it is that as it turns out the impressive RTX voice noise suppression app
[2852.16 → 2858.32] doesn't actually require ray tracing or RT or tensor course to function and there's a fallback
[2858.32 → 2866.08] not even yeah there's a fallback no there's a fallback to general purpose Cuba course and so
[2866.08 → 2871.76] but yes the good thing about it being on tensor cores was that you could be gaming and streaming
[2871.76 → 2877.68] and you could turn on RTX voice without using any of the resources that you used to be contributing to
[2877.68 → 2886.96] those other things uh yes but also anecdotally the GPU fallback mode uses very few GPU resources
[2886.96 → 2894.64] with random hid reporting one to two percent usage on a GTX 980 and about 300 megabytes of VRAM usage
[2895.44 → 2901.92] so, so sweet all the kind of thing where you're like you use it and suddenly I'm like this is going
[2901.92 → 2907.12] to be on every app in two years everything's going to have it yes it's going to have it every phone app
[2907.12 → 2912.88] every game we all use it all the time don't turn it off it's on by default so sweet it's shockingly good
[2912.88 → 2919.60] like the in the video I've got my kids shrieking in the background behind me like really giving her
[2919.60 → 2925.92] and i I mean I couldn't hear the difference because I only hear uh like my monitoring is a direct feed
[2925.92 → 2932.40] from my mic so it doesn't pass through RTX voice processing before I hear it uh that's so that i
[2932.40 → 2936.72] don't have any latency on my own voice so that it's easier to talk so I couldn't hear the difference it
[2936.72 → 2941.36] was making I was just like hey Alex is it like working now, and he's like whoa yeah so I went back and i
[2941.36 → 2946.64] watched the video, and it's mind-blowing it's just unbelievable because I could see it being able
[2946.64 → 2951.12] to get rid of something simple like the background hum of an air conditioning unit or something like
[2951.12 → 2958.96] that right like something predictable but to filter out human voices from a recording that is supposed to
[2958.96 → 2966.08] contain human voices that's next level right like filtering out the wrong voices it's amazing
[2966.08 → 2974.16] this is going to be so awesome when this hits headphones oh for sure how long maybe
[2974.16 → 2977.84] two years or something like that you'll be able to get headphones that were the active noise-cancelling
[2977.84 → 2983.20] man does variable waveforms rather than just the continuous waveforms we're used to from the engine hum
[2983.76 → 2989.04] actually can't hear any crying babies nothing man it's gonna it's going to change air travel forever
[2989.04 → 2997.76] assuming the air travel industry survives um oops oh sorry by the time you put you ride on a plane again
[2997.76 → 3003.44] you might have these yeah I know right, so the crazy thing is you can actually run the Cuba version on
[3003.44 → 3016.00] hardware as old as fermi so that would be a GTX 400 series it's like what is that 10 years ago or something like that it's ridiculous 10 11 years ago
[3016.00 → 3026.40] um all you have to do is make a quick edit to the file after launching the installer for it to install and run normally on north hardware
[3027.36 → 3038.32] that's pretty crazy um now it may be any way to use this on integrated graphics at all uh no, so even the backup code path is Cuba
[3038.32 → 3045.68] so that would require nvidia hardware um some there's some speculation that the reason NVIDIA didn't
[3045.68 → 3052.96] just open it up to everyone might be that um it does use some of your GPU resources that could
[3052.96 → 3058.40] otherwise be used for gaming and does use some of your VRAM so they might have been concerned about
[3058.96 → 3066.40] um you know I mean we all remember the GTX 970 memory problems where part of the memory was slower
[3066.40 → 3070.72] that led to a class action lawsuit over false advertising I mean if they came out, and they were like hey
[3070.72 → 3078.00] there's no performance impact, and it turns out there is a small performance impact maybe that was their reason for withholding this version or maybe
[3078.00 → 3084.16] they just wanted to trickle it out I mean they've definitely done that in the past where they've given us a little bit of good news
[3084.16 → 3087.60] followed by more good news even though all the good news was ready in the first place
[3087.60 → 3096.72] I mean they're NVIDIA is perfect at AI they publish a ton of AI research papers if you ever follow the YouTuber two minute papers
[3096.72 → 3104.56] sweet YouTube channel um does a lot of um uh you know like you see those research papers where
[3104.56 → 3109.84] they have like an algorithm just like removing something from a photo and like just interpolating
[3109.84 → 3113.92] what the space behind that object would have looked like, and it just looks perfect NVIDIA does a lot of
[3113.92 → 3118.64] stuff like that they're very good at AI but I would expect other players to make similar technology to this
[3118.64 → 3125.52] really soon maybe it'll even end up being a pixel only feature from Google because Google is also very good at AI
[3125.52 → 3136.40] right yep and I think that I'm trying to remember if um is the latest pixels already have AI specific
[3136.40 → 3142.24] processing hardware in them do they have uh i I know Huawei brands it a CPU I'm trying to remember if
[3142.24 → 3148.64] google has an analogous unit inside uh the snapdragon versions that they're using I actually can't remember
[3148.64 → 3155.36] I mean there are a lot of phones that are already out there with AI specific hardware in them and i
[3155.36 → 3161.28] use AI loosely here what I really mean is machine learning of course in this case um but the photo
[3161.28 → 3167.36] processor I believe and maybe like a secure enclave yeah the circle the secure enclave probably wouldn't
[3167.36 → 3172.72] be useful for this kind of thing but the the the photo processor is something that could potentially
[3172.72 → 3177.12] be used you'd never be on a call and taking a picture at this well okay you could I guess but that
[3177.12 → 3181.76] would be very rare to be on a call and taking a picture at the same time so depending on the horsepower
[3181.76 → 3185.84] behind it maybe you could see something like this in your phone man that would be outstanding wouldn't
[3185.84 → 3196.96] it loves it uh all right rumour apple to sell macs with its own chips starting in 2021 apple is reportedly
[3196.96 → 3202.08] preparing to release at least one mac with its own chip next year but the initiative codename
[3202.08 → 3207.92] Klamath to develop three different chips based on the next iPhone's a14 processor suggests the company
[3207.92 → 3213.76] will transition more of its mac lineup away from its current supplier intel uh TSMC is rumoured to be
[3213.76 → 3219.36] building the new mac chips which will be based on a five nanometre production technique from oh yeah
[3219.36 → 3225.52] TSMC I guess I already said that so it's the same as the next iPhones and iPad pros and uh the first mac
[3225.52 → 3230.72] processors will allegedly have eight high performance cores codename firestorms and at least four energy
[3230.72 → 3239.12] efficient cores no codename ice storm wow they used to do their own code name man this is going to be
[3239.12 → 3244.24] crazy so having macs iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology could make it easier for
[3244.24 → 3248.64] apple to unify its app ecosystems and update its computers more often now one thing that's a little
[3248.64 → 3255.36] confusing to me is apple has got to be I don't know a decade away from building something that could
[3255.36 → 3262.48] conceivably end up in a successor to the mac pro so if they knew they were going down this path which
[3262.48 → 3266.40] if they're releasing something next year they would have known two three years ago four years five years
[3266.40 → 3271.76] ago that they were going down this path uh why did they bother to do the mac pro like is the mac pro
[3271.76 → 3281.44] just going to be this like weird abandonware product a few years from now again like is this is mac pro just
[3281.44 → 3286.48] going to turn into like this meme where it's like hey yeah we made a new mac pro, and it's good it's
[3286.48 → 3290.64] got all this great stuff, and you're going to be able to upgrade haha yeah forget uh I forget we ever
[3290.64 → 3296.32] said anything is that what's going to happen it could but if it's like six years later than who cares
[3296.88 → 3301.60] because if you're in the market for such hardware then, and you're continuing to do your job then your
[3301.60 → 3305.92] your update cycle is probably within that time frame anyway they're like they're probably going to
[3305.92 → 3314.00] start with the MacBook Air or like the least demanding macBook right so I don't know Alex has
[3314.00 → 3319.84] his take in here uh his family apparently bought a power pc mac two years before they switched to intel
[3319.84 → 3324.08] and he said yeah you were basically screwed no matter what because these were your options
[3324.08 → 3329.12] continue using Mac os 9 made for power pc and slowly have your application stop receiving updates
[3329.12 → 3336.00] but at least it's fast um also the programs that were bought for Mac os 9 still worked like f18 Korea
[3336.00 → 3341.68] gold okay thank you Alex for that or switch to macOS 10 which was made for intel and have everything
[3341.68 → 3347.52] chug on your power pc almost all programs for Mac os 9 didn't work at least current programs received
[3347.52 → 3355.12] updates though like okay yeah i i can see this being pretty, pretty nasty because any kind of
[3355.12 → 3362.08] emulation of x86 is going to come with a significant performance penalty and apple's been on x86 for a
[3362.08 → 3368.32] long time now like if they had made this transition sort of quickly again before everyone got settled
[3368.32 → 3371.44] maybe it would have been easier or maybe people would have been even more mad I don't know what
[3371.44 → 3376.48] would have been the better move, but maybe they'll give you an up like a bonus or a bundle for an up
[3376.48 → 3378.96] upgrade path, or maybe they'll do a buyback or something like that
[3378.96 → 3386.56] hmm all right I doubt it apple has i I can't think of any time they've done something as consumer
[3386.56 → 3392.00] friendly as a buyback there's no way it depends on the pushback they get like everybody
[3392.00 → 3398.00] freaked out about the um the throttling of the CPU when the uh because of the battery health and then
[3398.00 → 3403.60] they started offering battery replacements right that is true actually you know what I take it back
[3403.60 → 3409.12] that was a fairly consumer friendly way to handle that uh we've got one more that i really
[3409.12 → 3413.92] want to talk about uh android automotive coming soon not to be confused with android auto because
[3414.48 → 3419.84] google cannot stick to anything um android automotive will not require a phone plugged into
[3419.84 → 3425.44] your car in order to operate and will be arriving in the Volvo Polestar 2 an all-electric car so
[3425.44 → 3430.80] the whole infotainment system is going to be powered by android 10 and will offer google integrations
[3430.80 → 3437.28] um he says also the Polestar 2 has 408 horsepower and I really want to unbox one
[3437.28 → 3443.76] uh okay duly noted Alex thank you very much for that yeah I mean they sort of do there's like PDI
[3443.76 → 3448.88] right like they've got that uh you know that white vinyl wrap on it and stuff you know what I'll tell
[3448.88 → 3454.00] you what I mean short circuit like that's the whole idea behind that channel is like I don't give what
[3454.56 → 3458.72] products we cover whatever you're passionate about just go for it right Luke was right about the
[3458.72 → 3466.00] swearing thing how I can't hear the beep it's so jarring if you can convince Volvo to give
[3466.00 → 3472.72] you want to like unbox we'll do a short circuit no problem uh all right i I lied there's one more one
[3472.72 → 3478.64] more big deal uh the FCC has ratified unlicensed use of the six gigahertz radio frequency spectrum in
[3478.64 → 3483.76] the USA opening up the way for the proposed Wi-Fi 6e standard I thought that was dead in the water
[3483.76 → 3490.08] it's back baby this is the biggest spectrum edition since the FCC cleared the way for Wi-Fi in 1989 this
[3490.08 → 3497.84] is a big deal um, so six gigahertz is as you can probably tell from the name a little bit higher than
[3497.84 → 3501.76] five gigahertz so that means we're expecting a little bit less range but a little bit more data
[3501.76 → 3510.16] throughput and what's really cool is that uh it is a big chunk of spectrum so it's about the same
[3510.16 → 3517.12] theoretical top speed as five gigahertz about 9.6 gigabit per second um but I would expect to see
[3517.12 → 3523.76] performance improvements kind of across the board as spectrum just kind of gets less crowded so even
[3523.76 → 3529.04] if you are going to stick on five gigahertz if your neighbour moves to six your Wi-Fi is going to get
[3529.04 → 3534.08] noticeably faster um assuming that you and your neighbour are both heavy users new streaming video and
[3534.08 → 3539.12] stuff like obviously if neither of you were really using it, it won't get much faster uh industry giants intel
[3539.12 → 3544.00] and Broadcom began planning for this move two years ago uh Broadcom released its first Wi-Fi
[3544.00 → 3549.60] 6e chipset in February oh wow, so this is like oh this is great this is like this is coming deployment
[3549.60 → 3554.56] should really kick off in 2021 when the Wi-Fi alliance begins offering certifications for Wi-Fi
[3554.56 → 3563.60] 6e devices I'm jazzed more Wi-Fi faster Wi-Fi you know more spectrum can't uh you can't
[3563.60 → 3570.88] can't get me down about that I love it leading us to super chats and jams I know that you're you
[3570.88 → 3574.72] need to go so uh why don't you bail and I'll do the super I would like to excuse myself actually if
[3574.72 → 3580.16] that's okay with you yeah yeah for sure wow YouTube chat is going so fast I just like can't even
[3581.12 → 3583.76] oh I was going to say bye jams, but he can't hear me anymore
[3584.48 → 3588.24] bye jams all right so I'm just going to switch over to
[3588.24 → 3596.24] hey there he is Linus webcam and uh oh shoot I don't have the I don't have the assets for the uh
[3597.44 → 3600.64] yeah whatever it's fine it doesn't matter I was going to put the lower third on there
[3601.36 → 3611.20] um yeah oh wait do I have it add existing hey, hey look at that all right
[3611.20 → 3617.04] you know leave a little pixel there let's do some super chats shall we ladies and gentlemen
[3617.04 → 3623.12] oh it seems to be bugged no new super chats or members yet but I know I definitely saw some come
[3623.12 → 3628.32] in if I reload this page is it going to break it worse though shoot I might not have your super chats guys
[3630.48 → 3633.92] I blame YouTube I blame you YouTube
[3633.92 → 3643.12] the page is not even reloading help me out here YouTube come on hey it's in there nice all right
[3643.12 → 3646.88] I'm just going to expand this window a little bit so that my scroll bar works it really is just an
[3646.88 → 3653.20] awful page uh Marcos asks how's retirement oh it's great it's great I love retirement it's exactly like
[3653.20 → 3658.80] before you know i can hardly even tell the difference very comfortable uh lucky falcon any plans
[3658.80 → 3665.60] to keep the RTX intro we are potentially exploring doing something like that right now I believe we
[3665.60 → 3672.00] have a license to use it one time um and if it's possible to have a license to use it uh all the time
[3672.00 → 3676.08] the audience reaction to it was very good so we would definitely be interested in that option
[3676.56 → 3682.48] um jams old digit says with the massive speeds of USB 3.1 plus portable OS's are finally viable daily
[3682.48 → 3687.60] drivers would you consider doing a video on them like windows to go versus Linux the thing is that it's not
[3687.60 → 3692.72] about the sequential speed like we actually showed running windows on a superfast SD card
[3693.36 → 3700.24] the issue is the random Io, and it's still not good enough um USB has some protocol overhead that is
[3700.24 → 3708.64] not present in I mean definitely not NVMe not even SATA um so yeah I guess it's like kind of viable but
[3709.28 → 3714.00] I still wouldn't necessarily recommend it I'll, I'll think about it though I'll think about it thanks for
[3714.00 → 3719.28] the idea jams Robert says I'm writing this super chat on behalf of dozens of us I'm putting my
[3719.28 → 3724.32] money where my mouth is we want Baron green duct tape short circuit shirts, and we want them as soon
[3724.32 → 3731.12] as reasonably possible uh oh man I don't even know if we have any short circuit merch, yet we are working
[3731.12 → 3740.32] on it, we've got a really cool long sleeve design that I'm excited about um but no uh Dominic says for
[3740.32 → 3744.16] the last few weeks on float plane the audio slowly goes out of sync as the video plays make sure you
[3744.16 → 3749.76] send a message to support um just because they may want some extra information from you with respect to
[3749.76 → 3754.40] uh what device you're using and like if you're in your browser versus the app or whatever the case
[3754.40 → 3759.76] may be thanked you for that uh Jason says Luke is hot um that wasn't Luke on the show today
[3759.76 → 3762.48] uh but I'm sure he appreciates the sentiment either way
[3762.48 → 3769.52] uh Tommy gun says have you been to Germany uh yes or wait he says you have been to Germany yes
[3769.52 → 3774.56] yes I have uh what do you think about my fellow citizens' oh man I don't know what do you jeez
[3774.56 → 3781.04] be honest and deeply offensive if needed I would never I would never uh generalize about an entire
[3781.84 → 3787.12] country of citizens based on the limited amount of time that I have spent in Germany on a couple of
[3787.12 → 3793.28] trips there for work um you know I will say that I have yet to go anywhere where I have been
[3793.28 → 3800.48] disappointed in the hospitality of the people uh Germany was great in that regard um and if
[3800.48 → 3806.88] there's one generalization that I'll make i I was blown away by the organization of German businesses
[3806.88 → 3813.60] well I was over there I can say that much uh what else we got here I'm just going to do a few more here
[3813.60 → 3820.00] guys uh mike Adam says please turn off your Microsoft Teams okay yes I would but I've been
[3820.00 → 3827.52] having an issue where if i take the chat audio and I put it into my go SLR I can't boost it
[3827.52 → 3833.20] high enough with the mixer so I have to take I have to instead have it go through system and then I have
[3833.20 → 3838.32] to boost it in software that way because you guys keep complaining it's not loud enough so um I'm hoping
[3838.32 → 3844.56] to have no, no teams notifications uh next week but uh yeah I'll get back to you on that oh I missed
[3844.56 → 3849.60] something the folding at home shirts uh we have a delivery update we are receiving them Saturday
[3849.60 → 3855.28] morning so uh that's from the printer so they will hopefully all be shipped next week uh thank you for
[3855.28 → 3865.36] your patience guys um oh this is a great question from rob i kind of wish I had like Brandon on the
[3865.36 → 3870.40] show to talk about this with or David or something did red f up the hydrogen one launch so
[3870.40 → 3876.16] badly that we will never see a flagship phone that connects to a custom sensor and lens mount to make
[3876.16 → 3884.24] like a black magic uh pocket cinema camera killer like cine phone possibly I think that if I was someone
[3884.24 → 3890.00] else looking at how badly red flubbed that I would go wow I want exactly none of that action
[3890.00 → 3896.40] um that's a really great question uh Alex says which RGB lighting solution would you recommend
[3897.28 → 3903.20] next hue corsair sync etc trying not to have a dozen different programs uh you know what we've
[3903.20 → 3909.12] been pretty pleased with EK's so far their controller uses all non-proprietary BS so you don't have to deal
[3909.12 → 3915.28] with like corsair's little weird connector that nobody else uses and stuff like that um I haven't looked at
[3915.28 → 3920.56] what the CPU usage is like and I haven't spent a ton of time in the software I'd say corsairs is
[3920.56 → 3927.28] really mature if you're willing to accept that you kind of need to buy corsair stuff that's one of the
[3927.28 → 3931.44] reasons we throw commander pros in a lot of our showcase builds just because like it just works
[3931.44 → 3938.32] um so there that's my take on that uh ask says I look forward to buying Rolex style stock and leg
[3938.32 → 3946.64] through lttstore.com uh yeah I'm not planning to raise funds anytime in the foreseeable future uh
[3946.64 → 3952.72] Linus media group contrary to what some of the speculative posts I've seen on the forum have said
[3953.36 → 3960.40] Linus media group is absolutely financially stable uh in such a way that we just you know we have
[3960.40 → 3965.28] lots of opportunity to invest in the things that we think are important for our business and for our
[3965.28 → 3973.68] community without having to uh deal with any external stakeholders so um you know Yvonne and I are the
[3973.68 → 3979.92] shareholders of Linus media group incorporated and that's the way that we plan to keep it um
[3981.84 → 3990.08] all right let's see if there's uh theory says peony nope Coverdale rodeo nope many nopes Ltd question
[3990.08 → 3996.64] mark so that's a great question, and we will have an update for you guys soon but i unfortunately
[3996.64 → 4009.20] do not have one that I can share just yet not just yet um all right so that's pretty much it for the
[4010.16 → 4016.56] oh okay one more question one more arian 19 where does the price performance start decreasing
[4016.56 → 4022.64] on the AMD lineup for someone who will mostly game um I really like the 3600 I think it is a great
[4022.64 → 4027.84] balance of fantastic gaming performance good price and also the ability to do other stuff
[4028.48 → 4034.08] if you're into that uh or if maybe you just want great resale value on your chip instead of
[4034.08 → 4038.88] buying something that's pigeonholed into just gaming you know just with games today all right
[4038.88 → 4042.56] thanks for tuning into the wan show I hope you guys enjoyed it we'll see you again next week
[4042.56 → 4056.56] same bat time same bat channel and stream
