[0.00 --> 28.16]  What is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show for you guys this week lots of good tech news topics there's benchmarks leaked for the Ryzen 7 5800X that look extremely promising Google dropped the new Pixel 5 Pixel 4a 5G Chromecast with Google TV and Nest Audio speaker this week what else we got Luke?
[30.00 --> 59.98]  scrolling down here a bit Linus is posting another bounty what I am oh boy no I'm not I don't know about this okay maybe no wait what is this bounty opportunity in front of it okay apparently we're doing it you know what fine fine you know what oh no we're doing it we're doing it yeah it's your fault when Yvonne complains about it it's going to be 100% on you okay I haven't set the price at least that's true that's true that part's not my fault what else we got another bounty dual interface graphics card very
[59.98 --> 74.98]  interesting and Microsoft is messing around with ARM messing around let's roll that intro oh oh the intro's broken oh no ah there it is
[74.98 --> 103.48]  the show is nerd or die and Vessi footwear oh my oh yeah oops the amount I wear shoes these days
[103.48 --> 132.72]  is very low why don't we jump right into our big headline topic of the day benchmarks have leaked for the Ryzen 7 5800X and it looks like it could be as good or better than an Intel Core i9 yes my friends AMD copying Intel's branding might have actually kicked them in their own butt for the first time pretty much ever
[132.72 --> 161.72]  isn't that funny right like if people are at the store and they're like oh you know oh well this is only whatever 7 and this is 9 this 9 one must be better I mean that was always the way that AMD did it back in the day when they first introduced PR or performance rating is I think what it was short for where Intel had a 2.5 gigahertz and then I don't think Intel actually ever did a 2.5 gigahertz Pentium whatever but the point is AMD would have 2500 plus
[161.72 --> 188.72]  2500 plus even though they ran at a lower clock speed and that was because by AMD's uh estimation their 2500 plus even though it was a lower clock speed was equivalent in performance to the 2.5 gigahertz equivalent generation Intel and and that was gross in fairness in fairness to AMD a lot of the time uh their lower clock processors were in fact competitive with higher clocked Intel ones they were just very optimistic
[188.72 --> 218.56]  optimistic at times about how they applied that PR rating and the fact that they put a plus at the end of it that was that was very optimistic at times so now after copying Intel's positioning very Intel's very uncreative positioning AMD could be the ones that are like oh um well this is awkward we can't call the 5800x a Ryzen 9 when it was a Ryzen 7 like
[218.56 --> 239.78]  last generation last generation last generation last generation last generation for the 3800x so I guess it's gonna have to be a Ryzen 7 but this thing absolutely kicks around the 10900k so ahead of AMD's October 18 October 8th Ryzen announcement details on their upcoming Zen 3 based processors have allegedly leaked now here's a bit of a problem Luke you play a lot of Ashes of Singularity you play a lot of that game
[239.78 --> 247.70]  is that what you play on Friday night Saturday night let's let's let's see I want to see like it's on Steam right Wednesday night Wednesday night
[247.70 --> 254.88]  we did this very recently with with Flight Simulator so I want to see like Steam stats on Ashes of Singularity
[254.88 --> 261.34]  sure so while you're while you're pulling that up uh according to an Ashes of the Singularity benchmark discovered by
[261.34 --> 269.28]  API APISAC I don't know how I'm supposed to pronounce that AMD is skipping the 4000 series for their desktop CPU names
[269.28 --> 292.60]  this makes a ton of sense I I'm not gonna say I love this move because I hated the move that they made in the first place putting them out of sync for mobile and desktop but I appreciate this move because it makes it much easier for consumers to know what they're getting so mobile is obviously gonna have to get a new series because they already call Zen 2
[292.60 --> 306.60]  uh Ryzen 4000 so then if mobile has to be 5000 then desktop should be 5000 too so that we know architecturally what kind of product we're buying so 5000 series looks like it's gonna be Zen 3
[306.60 --> 325.60]  as for the benchmarks themselves they're no longer available on the Ashes website but when they were there they revealed that an 8 core Ryzen 7 5800X would be superior in terms of CPU performance and roughly comparable in terms of GPU performance to the Core i9 10900K
[325.60 --> 353.96]  and there's actually a graph there's a graph there's a graph here posted by Ponson on the Twitter so red or orange or whatever color that is is the 5800X and then we've got blue is a 10900K and a 3800X is in yellow so that is a massive massive intergenerational performance improvement all right but uh this is a very popular game though right Luke how popular is it
[353.96 --> 383.54]  so on Twitch there is no one streaming it so on Twitch there is no one streaming it and the last stream was about a month ago no one uh and that's gotta be a glitch and on Steam charts the last 24 hour peak was actually higher than I expected at 83 players wow 83 players so then that's basically the 20 or so tech reviewers that might have been using it as a synthetic benchmark break basically and 60 whole
[383.54 --> 413.52]  people all dozens of us playing ashes of the singularity that is just fantastic um separate leaked benchmarks placed the Ryzen 9 5900X so this would be the 12 core running with a boost clock of 5 gigahertz at a mere 150 watt TDP uh wait mirror wow that's that's a lot it seems like AMD's pushing hard but if they got to 5 gigahertz that's gonna be pretty impressive that has eluded AMD since the
[413.52 --> 419.08]  launch of the launch of the launch of the launch of the launch of the launch of the Verizon and there's no way it's all cores but uh that's very fast
[419.08 --> 429.42]  one sec if what what happened uh on the week of Monday April the 27th Monday April the 27th
[429.42 --> 441.90]  the week of Monday so like from that Monday forward what happened that week because if you go if you go on Steam stats Steam charts and you look at Ash's Singularity they have steadily declining players for the last year from 200
[441.90 --> 453.54]  down to like 83 whatever I did for the last 24 hour peak but they do it by week and for the week of Monday April the 27th uh what year in 2019
[453.54 --> 469.50]  2020 it spikes from 160 players the week before to 3758 weird and then immediately back down to 340 the week after that 184 the week after that
[469.50 --> 491.10]  like it slams up and then completely drops down what big tech news was there that week I have no idea actually I do not I do not recall uh anything in particular happening that week um it looks like okay sorry they say week from
[491.10 --> 498.46]  um but it looks like they're doing it monthly so I don't so did something happen in I have no idea what
[498.46 --> 506.62]  happened in April early so was there something that happened in May Intel CPUs launch ah I don't remember
[506.62 --> 512.44]  but like why ashes all over the place hold on there's a few more things I want to wrap up with here sure so
[512.44 --> 520.38]  aside from the core count and clock speed rumors Zen 3 is also expected to feature significant IPC improvements so
[520.38 --> 531.54]  that's performance per clock and we're thinking about 15% compared to Zen 2 so theoretically with both a clock speed and IPC improvement
[531.54 --> 537.84]  Ryzen 5000 series could be well ahead of Comet Lake
[537.84 --> 546.08]  AMD previously stated they'll be using an evolution of TSMC's 7 nanometer process um they have not actually named it directly
[546.08 --> 557.12]  uh the enhanced N7P process which boasts a 7%-ish performance improvement over N7 seems like the best fit after AMD clarified that their 7 nanometer plus
[557.12 --> 563.90]  nomenclature did not mean a more sophisticated EUV based N7 plus process which claims a 10% improvement so
[563.90 --> 568.20]  dang but can I can I go tinfoil hat here for a second
[568.20 --> 575.92]  can I go tinfoil hat and like please do I don't actually think this is necessary I don't think this is true there
[575.92 --> 582.40]  I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm just gonna put it out there as something that I don't think is true but it is just extremely fishy
[582.40 --> 588.08]  even reviewers don't use ashes of the singularity anymore
[588.08 --> 597.98]  yeah not really could this be an AMD cherry-picked scenario that they accidentally leaked
[597.98 --> 608.88]  it's uh it's yeah I would give that a a pretty high chance of being a thing like ashes of the singularity is such a
[608.88 --> 617.46]  like a non-factor even for most reviewers at this point I have still seen it in presentations from
[617.46 --> 624.56]  manufacturers where it seems like they don't read the same you know uh news that we do out in the media
[624.56 --> 628.28]  or maybe they're just not paying as close attention or maybe it's like a licensing thing
[628.28 --> 635.60]  like they have a harder time licensing games for use for like official presentations I know that that can be a thing
[635.60 --> 640.08]  like I remember um there was an Intel laptop running um
[640.08 --> 648.10]  uh Xe graphics a little while back at like uh some trade show I think it was like very early Xe graphics at the last CES
[648.10 --> 651.96]  and I was like hey I don't I don't want to play Counter-Strike I want to play like
[651.96 --> 656.00]  at the time what was cool at the time Fortnite or whatever like I want to play this and they're like
[656.00 --> 660.86]  sure uh I don't remember who it was so I'm not accusing anyone in particular but some popular
[660.86 --> 666.08]  battle royale game and they were like yeah we we tried we know but they they wouldn't allow us to do it
[666.08 --> 672.20]  I'm like you got to be kidding me that's basically marketing for their product that's that's that's you
[672.20 --> 679.82]  Intel the gigantic multinational multi-billion dollar organization acknowledging their game
[679.82 --> 686.96]  as like the hotness right now why why would you expect to be paid for that are you insane
[686.96 --> 693.34]  so it could just be that Ashes and Singularity is a popular one for companies to use because it's like
[693.34 --> 700.58]  it has a very wide range of technology support you know DirectX 12 SLI things that real games for
[700.58 --> 706.18]  whatever reason can't implement but this one can and uh and I guess they're they're real cooperative
[706.18 --> 714.22]  about about using it um so so that's my guess is whether accidentally or on purpose I think this
[714.22 --> 720.14]  came straight from AMD there you know what no I I do think I don't think it happened on purpose
[720.14 --> 724.26]  I think it was probably an accident because they were probably using it internally to create the decks
[724.26 --> 729.06]  for the presentation for the launch of Zen 3 I'm on I'm on board with your previous opinion to a
[729.06 --> 735.84]  certain degree because we we've seen this a lot over the last few years like these these totally
[735.84 --> 742.96]  not intentional leaks that come from companies like it's it's been happening a ton so I like yeah
[742.96 --> 747.80]  maybe it is maybe it isn't but I wouldn't be surprised at all if it if it was an intentional
[747.80 --> 753.70]  leak it's also really hard to keep things under wraps like I mean you saw the whole thing with uh what
[753.70 --> 763.92]  was it um uh was it I think it was uh Tesla that had like a literal spy like yeah try to steal and try
[763.92 --> 770.16]  to steal uh data from their company like like this is a thing when you're when you have you know something
[770.16 --> 777.02]  like a new iPhone the week before it launched like I would not be surprised if you could get tens of
[777.02 --> 782.92]  thousands of dollars for it from some publication that wants to to break the news of what the new
[782.92 --> 790.42]  iPhone looks like early or whatever the case may be yep yeah definitely um I think we got to the
[790.42 --> 794.92]  bottom of the Ashley Singularity thing I can't find like actual proof of this but it seems like
[794.92 --> 805.04]  it was included in a humble bundle and then everyone immediately quit playing oh ouch sad at least they
[805.04 --> 810.96]  started playing it which for humble bundles is is probably yeah pretty good that's pretty good
[810.96 --> 816.50]  that's pretty good quick ltdstore.com mention not going to talk a ton about it today we're not
[816.50 --> 820.70]  launching anything but those crew neck sweaters that we uh announced on the last man show there
[820.70 --> 826.02]  are less than 100 left and restock is going to take a few months so if you want a nice uh snuggly
[826.02 --> 831.02]  sweater to wear for the winter then uh make sure you place an order now heads up to those that were
[831.02 --> 834.56]  able to get a foil keyboard shirt by the way they are shipping out next week
[834.56 --> 839.02]  um also ltdstore is hiring just go to linusmediagroup.com for information
[839.02 --> 845.72]  hiring like six people or something stupid like that all right another big news google drops the
[845.72 --> 855.62]  new pixel 5 pixel 4a 5g chromecast with google tv and nest audio it's techtober it's a pun so let's
[855.62 --> 862.66]  talk about really for me what is the big news on the pixel 5 the fact that it is sporting a
[862.66 --> 873.58]  snapdragon 765g this is an soc that launched in hold on a second let me just have a let me just have a
[873.58 --> 883.30]  quick look at the launch date of this particular processor uh one plus nord unveiled on july 21st
[883.30 --> 892.06]  oh no no come on when did it come out the release date expanded full story uh whatever it's not new
[892.06 --> 900.20]  it's it's not particularly new and more importantly while it does have new features if i recall correctly
[900.20 --> 907.44]  it has built-in 5g support um compared to what manufacturers have had to do like bolting 5g
[907.44 --> 914.30]  support onto the snapdragon 865 chipset um like the flagship chipset uh so i believe it has 5g support
[914.30 --> 921.80]  but in terms of performance it is actually a downgrade not just from flagship socs today
[921.80 --> 931.84]  but actually from the previous pixel like what so luke tell me this yes
[931.84 --> 941.70]  would you buy a brand new pixel that is slower than your old pixel yes what why i didn't expect i
[941.70 --> 946.44]  didn't think you were gonna expect that answer um is that the only reason you said that because
[946.44 --> 953.94]  no no i don't need speed in my phone anymore but why have it slower if if there's other benefits i'm not
[953.94 --> 963.04]  i'm not sure but if there if there if there are other benefits to it like if somehow i i don't think
[963.04 --> 967.74]  this is true but if somehow it's better for battery life if somehow it does these other things
[967.74 --> 973.58]  sure because i absolutely do not need performance in my phone anymore i'm still running a pixel 2xl
[973.58 --> 980.00]  and the only reason why i'm hungry for an upgrade is one i can't solve notification problems i've received
[980.00 --> 986.08]  all your emails i've received the tweets none of it's working i actually have my sim in my pixel
[986.08 --> 992.54]  one and the notifications are fine so i'm actually using a pixel one more often than anything else
[992.54 --> 998.84]  which is great my other problem with my pixel 2 is the proximity sensor is busted got it so if i
[998.84 --> 1004.98]  answer a call i can't dial got it always thinks that it's up next to my face so that i like want a new
[1004.98 --> 1009.82]  phone because of that if those two problems didn't exist i literally wouldn't want a new phone
[1009.82 --> 1016.20]  there's no point it would be it wouldn't be worth even if it was free it wouldn't be worth the hassle
[1016.20 --> 1025.24]  of like migrating over to a new phone okay that's um that's a fair point um like if if there is some
[1025.24 --> 1031.24]  form of benefit then sure because i genuinely do not care about increased performance at all i don't
[1031.24 --> 1036.84]  play games i don't do any of that kind of stuff i don't need more performance to do emails i don't need
[1036.84 --> 1042.40]  more performance to call people or send text messages or read twitter i don't need more
[1042.40 --> 1046.96]  performance to watch a youtube video i don't need more performance to use floatplane i'm completely
[1046.96 --> 1053.76]  fine for what i do that's fair but if there isn't some other type of advantage for the decreased
[1053.76 --> 1059.00]  performance then like yeah sure if i'm paying for it i might as well get it okay um so in terms of
[1059.00 --> 1064.72]  other features uh 90 hertz refresh rate is still 90 hertz refresh rate compared to the pixel 4
[1064.72 --> 1071.22]  face unlock has been ditched so uh apple's still holding on to it but um looks like the rest of
[1071.22 --> 1076.52]  the industry is like yeah yeah fingerprint readers were pretty good uh i actually really like the
[1076.52 --> 1080.96]  fingerprint reader on the fold so it's just built into the button like sony used to do with the
[1080.96 --> 1085.58]  xperia i don't know might still do i haven't used an xperia in a while uh like way back in the day
[1085.58 --> 1092.22]  it's it's it's pretty good um it's got eight gigs of ram instead of six gigs reverse wireless
[1092.22 --> 1096.46]  charging now so you can charge your other stuff off your phone if you have a need to do that and
[1096.46 --> 1103.54]  ip68 ingress protection here's the thing that kind of bothers me a little bit though it's like
[1103.54 --> 1109.04]  it's priced at 700 us dollars which i guess is pretty reasonable for a flagship except that it's
[1109.04 --> 1114.30]  sort of not really not a flagship not really a flagship and i guess
[1114.30 --> 1123.74]  what i'm trying to say is if phone manufacturers themselves and google's not the only one like lg did
[1123.74 --> 1127.98]  the same thing with the velvet uh if phone manufacturers are starting to say okay yeah
[1127.98 --> 1134.18]  the performance of these things is like good enough then what i want to know is fine then
[1134.18 --> 1142.46]  where is the commitment to support this thing in the long term like three years is okay but apple
[1142.46 --> 1149.58]  is way ahead and i understand that apple gets a huge advantage in that they get massive revenue
[1149.58 --> 1155.16]  through the app store to subsidize their iphone business should they see fit but google could easily
[1155.16 --> 1161.24]  do the same thing with their play store revenue and i'm going to propose something really crazy right
[1161.24 --> 1169.52]  now that is probably going to be pretty unpopular um what if you could just pay a monthly fee
[1169.52 --> 1177.08]  for ongoing operating system support is that something that would help rather than hinder the
[1177.08 --> 1184.56]  industry like i think fragmentation is an enormous problem because you know from the manufacturer side
[1184.56 --> 1191.52]  of things every device is going to have its own little quirks and you can collapse under the weight of it
[1191.52 --> 1198.14]  you know the internet hates it by the way they hate it they hate it just i i have not seen a single
[1198.14 --> 1206.14]  person in chat vote with you every single person has been like no well then what's your solution
[1206.14 --> 1212.02]  what's your solution to be clear i'm not saying that it should be pay as you go from day one
[1212.02 --> 1218.38]  there should be three years of of committed software updates but then what when you're moving
[1218.38 --> 1225.40]  into your fourth year would you rather have right would you rather have it be garbage and e-waste and
[1225.40 --> 1230.64]  end up in a landfill somewhere and to be clear i'm aware that obviously they can recycle a lot of the
[1230.64 --> 1239.08]  materials but recycling is not an efficient process it's not so would you rather it ultimately a perfectly
[1239.08 --> 1244.98]  otherwise working device that's now no longer getting security updates would you rather it poison the
[1244.98 --> 1252.54]  earth or would you rather just keep using it if it cost you three bucks a month because remember
[1252.54 --> 1259.02]  we're not talking about like three dollars a month compared to what you get for free now you should
[1259.02 --> 1264.64]  still get what you get for free now i'm just saying we need some kind of an option because it's very
[1264.64 --> 1272.54]  clear from all the analysis that's been done over the years of how apple has you know x percentage of the
[1272.54 --> 1279.28]  smartphone market in terms of revenue but has y percentage of the smartphone market in terms of
[1279.28 --> 1285.60]  actual profit like it's been very clear for a long time that the business model of android sort of
[1285.60 --> 1294.22]  handset makers is not great like it's not sustainable if we want devices to last for a very long time so
[1294.22 --> 1302.96]  we have to do something and it's either you get ads all over your phone which is clearly already happening or you
[1302.96 --> 1309.90]  go the youtube premium route and you say okay yeah i get that it used to be free but like i i'm willing to pay
[1309.90 --> 1314.86]  for this to to keep working the way that i liked it now that we've determined that this model is is not
[1314.86 --> 1323.24]  sustainable so with that in mind do you guys hate it slightly less uh spoiler alert i i don't think so
[1323.24 --> 1330.74]  i i think they still hate it just as much uh just just reading the like responses well i'd like it i think
[1330.74 --> 1339.38]  i think you are getting at least a somewhat i'm not gonna twitch that's gonna hate me now i could i could
[1339.38 --> 1343.86]  have gone the easier out here but i'm not i think you're getting at least somewhat an emotional response
[1343.86 --> 1352.32]  right um because like they're right now the option that you're getting is is nothing you you if you
[1352.32 --> 1358.20]  get three years out of your device you're probably lucky at this point um and then you're just dropped
[1358.20 --> 1365.72]  so an option yeah would be good and like to be clear look okay we've got a super chat from mark lane
[1365.72 --> 1370.46]  who apparently thinks it's worth spending five dollars to send a text message on the internet but
[1370.46 --> 1376.24]  doesn't think this is a good idea mark lane goes my pixel excel works great yet it's no longer
[1376.24 --> 1382.14]  supported why linus why well obviously you could still have the option to just not get security
[1382.14 --> 1388.92]  updates but that's not a great choice either there's some there's some yeah what isn't it like lineage os
[1388.92 --> 1396.88]  or lin i don't remember what it is but i think it's yeah lineage os you could do this but like
[1396.88 --> 1402.40]  most people aren't going to do that so another option another option is the legislative route
[1402.40 --> 1408.80]  so right so you go to your representatives and you say look it should be it should be illegal for a
[1408.80 --> 1415.02]  perfectly for perfectly functioning hardware to have absolutely no path forward and you go yeah i
[1415.02 --> 1419.98]  understand that while you're selling this device obviously you can't uh you can't provide the tools
[1419.98 --> 1426.00]  or you don't want to provide the tools to allow lineage os to be installed on it or whatever you know you
[1426.00 --> 1429.90]  want to make sure that you're managing the user experience but once it's passed like it's two
[1429.90 --> 1433.76]  year window or something yeah once it's past its window where you're not going to support it anymore
[1433.76 --> 1438.66]  you must provide the tools you must create this tool set so that someone else can carry on the work
[1438.66 --> 1445.34]  so that at least popular devices could still get support from the community so that's an option
[1445.34 --> 1452.84]  but what are the freaking odds what are the odds that's going to happen none like we can't even
[1452.84 --> 1456.26]  agree it's true like we can't even agree net neutrality is a good idea luke
[1456.26 --> 1466.28]  well you and i can but um it it yeah i don't know pixel pixel one is is is pretty good
[1466.28 --> 1475.10]  it's got some big old bezels it's got big old bezels the the screen is big pretty gross big bitty bezels
[1475.10 --> 1478.94]  there's there's some things that definitely feel out of date but the usability of it like i can send
[1478.94 --> 1485.82]  emails on there completely fine nathan nathan green's youtube videos nathan green says what
[1485.82 --> 1490.94]  about a one-time fee for the update that's not how it works though like you got to understand
[1490.94 --> 1499.42]  developers at these companies don't get paid one time so in order to build a sustainable support
[1499.42 --> 1504.66]  ecosystem for these products they have to know that there is predictable revenue coming i mean
[1504.66 --> 1510.48]  that's why the gaming industry moved towards first microtransactions which is basically what you're
[1510.48 --> 1515.36]  proposing by the way i thought we all agreed those were evil and then subscription services which
[1515.36 --> 1521.14]  is pretty much what i'm proposing i'm just skipping a step both and the one-time purchase yeah it's
[1521.14 --> 1524.96]  awesome you buy the one-time purchase you pay a subscription how about everything how about
[1524.96 --> 1530.16]  everything unless you're microsoft in which case you have enough money to buy the earth and all the
[1530.16 --> 1534.00]  heavens and you just go yeah you pay the monthly fee for game pass we'll just give you an xbox
[1534.00 --> 1539.96]  go for it i mean not quite but games pass really is a very good deal
[1539.96 --> 1549.04]  it really is so okay you guys don't agree um fine i get it but you gotta understand too
[1549.04 --> 1554.52]  that while you may not agree with my way of framing this money you're paying for it somewhere
[1554.52 --> 1563.10]  epic's argument for how apple's 30 percent uh gleaning of all app store revenue ultimately takes
[1563.10 --> 1568.80]  money out of the pockets of whether it's consumers so whether the app developer would have charged a
[1568.80 --> 1573.80]  lower price and you would have paid less so whether it's consumers or developers apple is ultimately
[1573.80 --> 1578.74]  taking that money and going let's put it in the however many hundreds of billions of dollars pile
[1578.74 --> 1586.88]  um you're paying for that whether it's from the the point that you purchased the device whether it's
[1586.88 --> 1592.18]  from the purchases you make for vbucks on the app store or whether it's from a subscription service that
[1592.18 --> 1598.56]  just is what it says it is a device maintenance like software maintenance fee that you pay on a
[1598.56 --> 1602.38]  monthly basis it's all the same thing it's all just how they frame it
[1602.38 --> 1610.04]  yeah so jaw media says or pay sixteen hundred dollars for a device and have the updates and
[1610.04 --> 1615.16]  include included across the life of the device yeah that's exactly the same thing so why do devices
[1615.16 --> 1620.54]  keep getting more expensive quite frankly the hardware isn't that much more expensive we actually we know
[1620.54 --> 1627.66]  from um from working with a particular brand i'm not gonna say who it is because i don't want to get
[1627.66 --> 1638.00]  them in trouble but uh let's see oh man this is a really long email thread but we actually know the
[1638.00 --> 1646.84]  price difference between a snapdragon 865 and a 765g and it's not as much as you might think
[1646.84 --> 1653.28]  uh let me just do a quick search for oh man wait oh oh i think i found it oh i think i found it
[1653.28 --> 1661.86]  yeah here we go so i'm not naming anybody but the difference in price for the like component cost for
[1661.86 --> 1671.18]  the chipset is apparently about 70 dollars so there's no reason why a phone that's equipped with
[1671.18 --> 1679.42]  a snapdragon 865 needs to be a thousand dollars and one that's equipped with a 765g should be 700
[1679.42 --> 1687.88]  dollars yeah uh like even if you make the assumption that every increasing cost doubles the retail price
[1687.88 --> 1692.66]  actually no that works out about right so if you say every increase in cost about doubles the retail
[1692.66 --> 1701.20]  price then yes that works out but the thing here is that like why why does it need to it's not like
[1701.20 --> 1708.36]  from a from a product development standpoint using uh uh an 865 you know made it take twice as long you
[1708.36 --> 1713.70]  might need you might need better cooling i don't think that needs to double your end user price but
[1713.70 --> 1718.38]  you know what what do i know i charge the same price for two different sizes of water bottle that do
[1718.38 --> 1724.82]  not have the same cost to me so i'm clearly just i clearly don't understand business 2020 edition
[1724.82 --> 1732.74]  all right well that was not the answer i expected um so how about this would you even bother buying a
[1732.74 --> 1739.24]  pixel 5 now that the pixel 4a 5g is out with a slightly larger screen compared to the 5.8 inch
[1739.24 --> 1746.28]  previous one so that's uh 6.2 inch display about the same size as the pixel 5 uh 6 gigs of ram so a
[1746.28 --> 1751.52]  little less ram uh i don't believe it has a 90 hertz display and it's just 500 us dollars same camera
[1751.52 --> 1753.72]  setup same camera setup
[1753.72 --> 1764.62]  you're muted uh sorry i was talking about it i'm back we're here uh i need a new phone because because
[1764.62 --> 1771.28]  of all the i'm currently running dual phones and like life sucks um and i've been waiting for like
[1771.28 --> 1776.94]  this announcement basically and yeah i'm i'm currently leaning towards the 4a 5g
[1776.94 --> 1787.22]  4a 5g looking pretty fly i honestly as much as we all meme this community about uh mobile gamers i
[1787.22 --> 1793.78]  would love to play mobile games if they didn't all suck they do suck and like i like there there is
[1793.78 --> 1798.54]  there's there's some arguments for like okay the games that i like to play are not necessarily
[1798.54 --> 1804.54]  going to translate super well to a phone but that's not entirely true for everything it's
[1804.54 --> 1810.76]  pretty true though it is it is pretty true but it's also a bit of a cop-out that has been used
[1810.76 --> 1815.16]  to just make terrible games yeah that's true i mean there's no reason something like hearthstone
[1815.16 --> 1820.62]  i mean it did it was on mobile there's no and that's that's a truly compelling game that you got
[1820.62 --> 1825.92]  super into that was that's a mobile game and i and i played i did play a bit on my phone i just
[1825.92 --> 1830.44]  haven't been playing for a while now but like that that was one of the few that i think were
[1830.44 --> 1837.64]  genuinely really good and there hasn't been very many and the thing is i i guarantee you i absolutely
[1837.64 --> 1843.92]  guarantee you that the pixel 4a 5g will knock hearthstone out of the park it should be all right
[1843.92 --> 1849.04]  it won't be a problem so like and like almost anything that i would think of with the control
[1849.04 --> 1852.66]  scheme that you have on a phone that would actually be a good experience in my opinion you
[1852.66 --> 1857.30]  can disagree with me as much as you want um it's gonna be pretty easy to run like if i could play
[1857.30 --> 1863.38]  like a tower defense game that wasn't laden down with micro transactions i'd just buy one yeah that'd
[1863.38 --> 1868.40]  be cool i'd like to have like warcraft 3 tower defense custom games on my phone that would be
[1868.40 --> 1874.38]  fantastic that would be awesome i would love to play winter mall tower defense like that would be
[1874.38 --> 1883.10]  great but i can't and if i could it would run just freaking fine yeah on a 4a 5g so like it just i just
[1883.10 --> 1890.52]  yeah i just don't care i yeah in other news i haven't been i haven't been uh heavily motivated by
[1890.52 --> 1896.92]  phones in quite a long time in other news the new nest audio is squarely focused on bringing higher
[1896.92 --> 1903.84]  quality sound to those who are already in the google uh home ecosystem they claim 50 more bass and
[1903.84 --> 1909.00]  75 more volume compared to the previous google home there's a 19 millimeter tweeter for high
[1909.00 --> 1914.28]  frequency sound and a 75 millimeter midwoofer to bring that bass and it'll come in five shades
[1914.28 --> 1922.18]  uh notably it's available for just a hundred us dollars dang sonos watch out because that whole
[1922.18 --> 1928.54]  thing where you guys charge a lot of money for your uh for your smart speakers looks like it's not
[1928.54 --> 1933.94]  going to be a thing for much longer sonos be mad too about uh google apparently allegedly infringing
[1933.94 --> 1939.56]  their patents so we're going to see how that plays out finally there's a chromecast tv with google tv
[1939.56 --> 1948.74]  which is great because google tv is is great and uh yeah so it's i mean it's just a rebranding of like
[1948.74 --> 1956.60]  android tv but um hey cool and youtube tv is integrated there's an entire live tv section that acts as like a
[1956.60 --> 1961.90]  live guide but it does not support stadia at least at launch for all dozens of you out there who are
[1961.90 --> 1967.08]  running stadia congratulations by the way thanks for paving the paving the way for the rest of us
[1967.08 --> 1973.18]  hey no i'm serious i'm serious right now like i'm not gonna think stadia is gonna stick around you
[1973.18 --> 1977.66]  don't think they're just gonna drop it okay well it's google so they might drop it but not everybody
[1977.66 --> 1983.30]  will what did they what did they drop recently just oh yeah yeah they just uh remember i think it was
[1983.30 --> 1988.60]  on wancho last week we were joking about google cardboard like does anybody still do that yeah
[1988.60 --> 1996.00]  they formally dropped daydream so google's whole daydream as a whole really daydream's whole vr google's
[1996.00 --> 2003.28]  whole vr ar strategy seems to have been a bunch of engineers that got a nerd on for it a few years ago
[2003.28 --> 2012.30]  and we're like wow we should like dr and then there was no business case for it whatsoever because
[2012.30 --> 2017.70]  people are not going to do that like they are not going to put their phone in some stupid holder and
[2017.70 --> 2023.78]  strap it to their head to like watch netflix that's ridiculous it's not comfortable and it looks awful
[2023.78 --> 2033.34]  um and so they they've accepted that it's dead like honestly sometimes i really do wonder if google
[2033.34 --> 2039.68]  practically runs like valve where you just yeah wander around and work on stuff that you think
[2039.68 --> 2046.52]  is interesting roll your desk over to like you know i don't know the the hangouts meet project like
[2046.52 --> 2052.64]  oh hey wow this is like got the same name as like hangouts but like meet is it a corporate offering
[2052.64 --> 2058.54]  no not really oh it's just it's like if i have the hangouts app and the hangouts meet app on my
[2058.54 --> 2063.78]  phone i'll just get two notifications for the same message wow that seems like a great idea i'm gonna
[2063.78 --> 2069.94]  roll my desk right up here and i mean don't get me started on youtube stories youtube stories
[2069.94 --> 2079.46]  has gotten as far as i can tell like two updates since they launched it over a year ago and get this
[2079.46 --> 2086.04]  get this the first fold my first complaint that i couldn't use the galaxy fold as my daily driver
[2086.04 --> 2095.86]  because youtube stories doesn't work on it for what reason i don't know was 10 months ago and yet
[2095.86 --> 2102.08]  here we are ladies and gentlemen i press the create button and i got well whatever you can't see that
[2102.08 --> 2112.68]  don't worry about it i got go live and i got video no stories no community posts why what difference does
[2112.68 --> 2123.84]  it make just put the button in there 10 months 10 months like they've got this completely like
[2123.84 --> 2130.32]  scatterbrained approach to product development i don't understand how they get anything done
[2130.32 --> 2138.68]  usually it seems like unless something completely blows it out of the park yeah it's dead and stadia
[2138.68 --> 2144.96]  sure as heck did not blow it out of the park so i i'm expecting it's just dead in the water i don't
[2144.96 --> 2150.38]  think it's gonna go anywhere have i talked like yeah go ahead when google abandoned something it's not
[2150.38 --> 2155.66]  it's not like they like open source at all no you're just so like they're like paving the way idea the
[2155.66 --> 2161.48]  reason why i like jumped on that is like it's just it's just dead and all the work they did on it is
[2161.48 --> 2170.14]  just gonna rot okay so here's a good one uh i was a happy google play music user uh google play music
[2170.14 --> 2175.72]  is getting sunsetted very soon well you didn't even pay for it but i was i was a happy paying google play
[2175.72 --> 2180.84]  music user and they're sun setting it in favor of youtube music i have sent a complaint about this to
[2180.84 --> 2185.36]  the youtube team because apparently it's like youtube now i'm like hey you guys have a couple
[2185.36 --> 2191.36]  of absolutely game-breaking problems here that are going to turn me from a paying customer into a
[2191.36 --> 2198.28]  non-paying customer here they are in no particular order number one google play music can cast directly
[2198.28 --> 2204.38]  to my sonos ecosystem in my house that i have spent hundreds nay thousands of dollars on at this point
[2204.38 --> 2211.42]  youtube music needs to do that if it doesn't i'm going to spotify which has that functionality
[2211.42 --> 2218.24]  because i hate sonos's own app it's horrible so what i want is to use the native app for my music
[2218.24 --> 2224.28]  service and then just cast it to my sonos speakers that's the world i want to live in uh and they're
[2224.28 --> 2231.76]  like oh yeah that's that's great feedback thanks number two number two get this on my family plan
[2231.76 --> 2238.10]  which i had for google play music and i intend to continue having for youtube music on my family
[2238.10 --> 2246.20]  plan i have my children and you so all my dependents you know basically so i got my so i got you and i
[2246.20 --> 2252.48]  got my kids right and they use google play music all the time because they can play music in their
[2252.48 --> 2257.36]  room i've got a sonos speaker in almost every room in my house now and they like listening to music
[2257.36 --> 2263.94]  and they're pretty tech savvy my son's got a phone so they use it youtube music has the same damn
[2263.94 --> 2272.82]  restrictions as the full youtube video app so if you're under 13 you can't use it what is the point
[2272.82 --> 2282.02]  of a family plan for a service that your kids can't use how is that how is that a thing i don't know if
[2282.02 --> 2286.82]  they've actually fixed that one yet but like how can you be like yeah here's the date when this service
[2286.82 --> 2292.98]  is going away completely by the way if you have a family or if you have a third party smart speaker
[2292.98 --> 2306.94]  i don't get it how are you a billions of dollars company and what was wrong i honestly what was
[2306.94 --> 2313.64]  wrong with google play music if you had to have it be youtube music just just rebranded or something
[2313.64 --> 2321.28]  like i'm sure there's some technical reason the music app is just super not as good as well like
[2321.28 --> 2328.68]  i know like is it as simple as they just the licensing for like music videos and stuff and
[2328.68 --> 2333.36]  stuff that they because i noticed that there were songs that are like clearly uploaded through like
[2333.36 --> 2338.68]  vivo accounts like officially to youtube that for whatever reason i couldn't listen to in google
[2338.68 --> 2344.02]  play music was it was this just a licensing thing if so just copy that code base and add the features
[2344.02 --> 2350.92]  like why are you reinventing the wheel all the time why are you reinventing the wheel all the time
[2350.92 --> 2359.84]  just stop google just stop for your own good just stop leave google music alone
[2359.84 --> 2367.18]  ah just makes me so angry like how is reminders still not working for g suite users i cannot set a
[2367.18 --> 2373.86]  reminder on my phone because i pay for the for the feature or for the service if i had it for free
[2373.86 --> 2380.94]  if i had it for free the feature would work how does that make any sense months i use the the like
[2380.94 --> 2384.62]  root main account for my phone i use as my personal account so that i can set reminder
[2384.62 --> 2391.08]  well i don't have like a personal it would oh it takes so much work for you to move all my calendars
[2391.08 --> 2395.92]  and all my crap over to my personal gmail account like i don't it's annoying i i did this like
[2395.92 --> 2402.56]  i think i did that with my shift to my pixel 2xl so dumb because my my previous one was my like work
[2402.56 --> 2407.14]  email because i actually prefer it that way for like a bunch of reasons but now i've shifted it over

[2471.58 --> 2478.74]  out at vessie.com slash wan show thank you sponsors for making this show this very disorganized show
[2478.74 --> 2481.44]  possible we have gotten through a total of two topics so far luke
[2481.44 --> 2484.98]  it's like almost seven
[2484.98 --> 2494.28]  this was the right move from nvidia i like this they have delayed the rtx 3070 launch to the end of october
[2494.28 --> 2501.78]  and they're doing this to allow for more stock to build up so that there might be some freaking chance
[2501.78 --> 2508.74]  that you can actually buy one and you might think this is an entirely altruistic move from nvidia
[2508.74 --> 2517.00]  um just to you know make life easier for the the gamers and the the shopkeepers who who all want to
[2517.00 --> 2525.42]  you know get their hands on this shiny new uh shiny new technology and as far as i can tell it actually
[2525.42 --> 2534.58]  appears to be hold on a second let me let me check something real quick here does it use the same
[2534.58 --> 2542.56]  die does it use the actual same die as so if the full ga blah blah blah ga 104
[2542.56 --> 2548.26]  uh ba gram ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ga 104 yeah no it
[2548.26 --> 2553.72]  actually it actually uses a different core i actually i have not looked into the uh 3070 much
[2553.72 --> 2561.20]  yet i will i'll figure it all out when we're doing the review so if nvidia was if this was a product
[2561.20 --> 2566.06]  where nvidia was going to be using harvested cores and selling them at a lower price you could say oh
[2566.06 --> 2570.94]  well they're probably just stalling so that they can sell more 3080s let's say for example
[2570.94 --> 2575.34]  sell more 3080s and people won't have the 3070 as an option.
[2575.52 --> 2577.92]  They're worried 3070 will cannibalize 3080 sales.
[2578.36 --> 2580.66]  But what actually seems to be happening here
[2580.66 --> 2582.62]  is because this is an entirely new core
[2582.62 --> 2586.80]  that is not shipping in any other product right now,
[2587.46 --> 2589.76]  NVIDIA may just be straight up
[2589.76 --> 2592.68]  trying to make life a little bit easier
[2592.68 --> 2594.62]  for someone who wants to get one on launch day
[2594.62 --> 2597.08]  because it would be in NVIDIA's best interest
[2597.08 --> 2600.98]  knowing that they are going to sell every single unit regardless.
[2601.50 --> 2603.08]  It would be in NVIDIA's best interest
[2603.08 --> 2605.76]  to take the money earlier rather than later.
[2605.88 --> 2607.68]  Remember, this is a product that they have spent
[2607.68 --> 2611.46]  I don't know how many tens, hundreds,
[2612.12 --> 2614.68]  thousands of millions of dollars building.
[2615.14 --> 2617.56]  Probably not a billion dollars for this one in particular,
[2617.72 --> 2619.76]  although it wouldn't surprise me if Ampere as a whole
[2619.76 --> 2621.20]  cost them a billion dollars.
[2621.82 --> 2623.36]  But this is a product that they spent
[2623.36 --> 2626.02]  definitely millions and millions of dollars developing
[2626.02 --> 2628.20]  and I'm sure they want to return on that investment
[2628.20 --> 2629.40]  sooner rather than later.
[2629.78 --> 2631.74]  So they are actually just putting it off
[2631.74 --> 2632.78]  for a few weeks here
[2632.78 --> 2635.64]  so that there is a chance
[2635.64 --> 2637.30]  that if you're one of the enthusiasts
[2637.30 --> 2638.70]  who really wants one on launch day,
[2638.76 --> 2639.78]  you'll actually be able to get one.
[2639.84 --> 2640.64]  I say good guy.
[2640.76 --> 2641.78]  I say good guy move.
[2645.00 --> 2646.52]  Anthony's saying the Radeon event.
[2646.58 --> 2647.32]  I see you see that.
[2647.44 --> 2647.54]  Yeah.
[2647.60 --> 2650.02]  The Radeon event is on the 28th.
[2650.74 --> 2653.56]  So, you know, maybe not entirely good guys.
[2653.56 --> 2656.12]  You know, they could also be trying to see
[2656.12 --> 2657.66]  what AMD is doing first.
[2658.24 --> 2660.30]  I also suspect that if I'm NVIDIA,
[2660.40 --> 2662.46]  I have a pretty good idea of what's coming from AMD
[2662.46 --> 2662.96]  at this point.
[2663.04 --> 2665.92]  It is amazing how much Intel those companies
[2665.92 --> 2666.84]  have on each other.
[2668.84 --> 2670.52]  Like, for realsies.
[2671.78 --> 2673.20]  So, blah, blah, blah.
[2673.58 --> 2676.34]  It's likely the 3070 will be the best price
[2676.34 --> 2678.58]  to performance ratio of the 3000 series.
[2678.72 --> 2680.68]  We're expecting 2080 Ti performance
[2680.68 --> 2682.28]  for about $500.
[2682.72 --> 2684.76]  But of course, that remains to be seen.
[2685.48 --> 2687.58]  I think even if they had the stock available,
[2687.98 --> 2689.96]  that like this launch wouldn't be problematic.
[2690.20 --> 2691.78]  I think delaying the launch,
[2692.30 --> 2694.26]  and I don't think that's the case at all.
[2694.40 --> 2695.54]  I don't think they have the stock,
[2695.62 --> 2696.52]  just to be very clear.
[2696.64 --> 2696.76]  Yeah.
[2696.80 --> 2698.92]  I'm just saying, even if they did,
[2700.18 --> 2702.46]  delaying the launch and saying that they did it
[2702.46 --> 2705.58]  for stock reasons would have been a win for them anyway.
[2706.14 --> 2706.86]  Yeah, that's fair.
[2707.54 --> 2708.10]  That's fair.
[2708.10 --> 2710.92]  I think this was the right move,
[2711.24 --> 2713.96]  like almost no matter what situation they're in,
[2714.16 --> 2716.14]  just because they got so much flack
[2716.14 --> 2719.36]  for like an ill-prepared response previously.
[2719.54 --> 2721.34]  And I think it's similar to like the gaming industry
[2721.34 --> 2721.70]  right now.
[2721.76 --> 2723.42]  People are getting very tired
[2723.42 --> 2726.64]  of these like terrible game launches
[2726.64 --> 2727.64]  where things aren't ready
[2727.64 --> 2729.52]  and there's like bugs out the gate.
[2729.74 --> 2732.10]  And now companies are starting to get praised
[2732.62 --> 2734.86]  for pushing game launches back.
[2734.86 --> 2737.28]  Which is like kind of whack,
[2737.46 --> 2740.84]  but honestly is probably the right way to approach it.
[2740.86 --> 2742.48]  Because if you're pushing a game launch,
[2742.58 --> 2743.36]  if you're pushing something
[2743.36 --> 2744.84]  that's going to make you money back,
[2744.94 --> 2747.16]  you're probably doing it because you need to.
[2747.32 --> 2749.36]  For some reason other than getting money,
[2749.42 --> 2750.50]  as much money as you can,
[2750.54 --> 2751.34]  as fast as possible.
[2751.54 --> 2751.70]  Yeah.
[2751.78 --> 2752.62]  And you're going to win,
[2752.80 --> 2754.10]  you're going to win appreciation
[2754.10 --> 2755.76]  from your audience for doing that.
[2755.76 --> 2757.64]  So yeah,
[2757.80 --> 2760.22]  I think they're winning some mind share
[2760.22 --> 2763.84]  and also being able to place it
[2763.84 --> 2766.00]  right behind AMD's launch.
[2766.14 --> 2768.00]  So if AMD surprises them,
[2768.44 --> 2770.04]  if AMD surprises them,
[2770.12 --> 2772.74]  it's a lot easier to drop your price
[2772.74 --> 2774.80]  before you've actually put any cards
[2774.80 --> 2775.84]  in the hands of customers
[2775.84 --> 2777.16]  than it is to do it
[2777.16 --> 2778.64]  after you've put cards
[2778.64 --> 2779.58]  in the hands of customers.
[2780.22 --> 2782.22]  So if AMD like pulls off
[2782.22 --> 2783.60]  some kind of coup here,
[2783.60 --> 2786.92]  NVIDIA has the option to issue
[2786.92 --> 2789.34]  after they've shipped the product rebates
[2789.34 --> 2791.96]  to their board partners and retailers
[2791.96 --> 2793.76]  if they want to.
[2795.56 --> 2797.32]  I suspect there's not going to be
[2797.32 --> 2798.36]  that many surprises,
[2798.60 --> 2799.74]  but I think that's just me.
[2799.90 --> 2801.38]  Like that's like a defense mechanism
[2801.38 --> 2803.10]  for me at this point about AMD.
[2803.60 --> 2804.26]  Like I just,
[2804.84 --> 2805.54]  I'm pretty,
[2805.62 --> 2806.04]  I'm pretty,
[2806.18 --> 2808.36]  I'm pretty bullish on like CPU right now,
[2808.36 --> 2809.06]  but man,
[2809.14 --> 2811.44]  AMD GPU has disappointed me so many times
[2811.44 --> 2812.20]  that I'm just like,
[2812.28 --> 2812.38]  yeah,
[2812.46 --> 2812.76]  whatever.
[2813.60 --> 2814.04]  Sure.
[2814.24 --> 2814.68]  Let's see.
[2815.00 --> 2815.74]  Let's see what happens.
[2819.90 --> 2821.12]  Microsoft announces
[2821.12 --> 2822.28]  Surface Laptop Go
[2822.28 --> 2824.44]  and new Surface Pro X.
[2824.80 --> 2826.12]  The Surface Laptop Go
[2826.12 --> 2829.70]  has a 12.4 inch 1536 by 1024 touch display,
[2830.16 --> 2831.42]  a 720p webcam,
[2831.62 --> 2833.36]  Core i5-1035G1.
[2833.46 --> 2833.92]  That's decent.
[2834.26 --> 2835.12]  4 gigs of RAM.
[2835.78 --> 2836.24]  Okay.
[2836.78 --> 2838.56]  64 gigs of eMMC storage,
[2838.56 --> 2839.40]  which is pretty lame,
[2839.62 --> 2841.10]  for $549.
[2841.10 --> 2842.94]  Um,
[2843.26 --> 2844.08]  I guess so.
[2845.30 --> 2846.68]  And the Surface Pro X,
[2846.94 --> 2848.60]  literally the same as the last Surface Pro X,
[2848.74 --> 2852.08]  but with the new Microsoft SQ2 processor.
[2852.48 --> 2853.82]  And what's interesting about this
[2853.82 --> 2857.54]  is that it's basically a modified Snapdragon 8CX Gen 2,
[2857.94 --> 2860.56]  which is a barely modified 8CX.
[2860.56 --> 2864.74]  But Windows on ARM is getting exciting
[2864.74 --> 2865.58]  because,
[2865.80 --> 2868.10]  we are leading into the next story here.
[2868.52 --> 2871.80]  Microsoft is planning to solve Windows on ARM's biggest flaw
[2871.80 --> 2873.42]  beginning in November.
[2873.84 --> 2875.16]  In a lengthy blog post,
[2875.32 --> 2876.16]  this is crazy.
[2876.60 --> 2879.06]  Microsoft outlined plans for future ARM development,
[2879.24 --> 2881.34]  including a new native Teams application
[2881.34 --> 2885.78]  and 64-bit x86 emulation support.
[2886.40 --> 2887.26]  Super cool.
[2892.30 --> 2893.18]  It's happening.
[2894.78 --> 2897.72]  64-bit emulation support has long been a stumbling block
[2897.72 --> 2898.50]  for Windows on ARM,
[2898.64 --> 2901.72]  as more and more software is compiled for 64-bit processors
[2901.72 --> 2902.68]  because it's been like,
[2903.02 --> 2903.58]  I don't know,
[2904.18 --> 2905.98]  when did the Athlon 64 come out?
[2906.02 --> 2906.72]  Like 2008?
[2907.26 --> 2908.58]  It's been like 12 years.
[2908.58 --> 2911.54]  So, that meant that until this announcement,
[2911.74 --> 2913.34]  if you had a Windows on ARM device,
[2913.48 --> 2915.42]  you had to hope that there was either
[2915.42 --> 2916.88]  an ARM native version of the app
[2916.88 --> 2918.30]  or 32-bit version of the app
[2918.30 --> 2919.40]  in order to run it at all.
[2920.08 --> 2920.52]  What's up, Luke?
[2921.28 --> 2921.68]  2003.
[2921.94 --> 2922.32]  2003.
[2922.62 --> 2923.02]  Oh, wow.
[2923.14 --> 2923.82]  So, I was way off.
[2923.94 --> 2924.46]  Sorry about that.
[2924.96 --> 2925.90]  Over 15 years.
[2926.28 --> 2929.04]  This is the second major x86 emulation layer
[2929.04 --> 2931.66]  that Microsoft has added to Windows on ARM
[2931.66 --> 2934.00]  with the previous Windows 8-based Windows RT
[2934.00 --> 2936.50]  having no x86 app support whatsoever.
[2936.50 --> 2939.28]  Now, we have no idea
[2939.28 --> 2941.28]  what the performance will be like.
[2941.38 --> 2942.14]  It could be terrible,
[2942.38 --> 2944.18]  but any performance is a lot better than,
[2944.64 --> 2946.00]  nope, lol.
[2947.38 --> 2948.44]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2948.52 --> 2950.08]  Because that's a big drawback.
[2950.18 --> 2952.00]  Like, a lot of people don't need to game on their laptop.
[2952.16 --> 2954.32]  I almost never run a game on my laptop.
[2954.56 --> 2955.44]  And if I did,
[2955.54 --> 2956.48]  a lot of the time,
[2956.52 --> 2957.30]  I would be at home
[2957.30 --> 2958.94]  where I could use a game streaming service.
[2959.44 --> 2961.00]  And not one that I subscribe to.
[2961.02 --> 2961.84]  I don't subscribe to any.
[2961.84 --> 2963.78]  But I could just stream off of my desktop
[2963.78 --> 2964.60]  using GeForce Now.
[2965.50 --> 2966.56]  Wait, is that what,
[2966.64 --> 2967.44]  is it still called that?
[2967.50 --> 2967.88]  Game stream.
[2968.28 --> 2970.54]  Sorry, GeForce Now is the other one.
[2970.76 --> 2971.92]  I think it's been rebranded like three times.
[2972.00 --> 2972.78]  Whatever, who cares?
[2973.26 --> 2974.40]  That would shield something.
[2977.40 --> 2979.08]  Anyway, so yeah,
[2979.16 --> 2979.40]  there's,
[2979.62 --> 2982.26]  I'm not too worried about things like game support.
[2982.44 --> 2983.80]  Because that's not who they're going after.
[2983.92 --> 2985.00]  Like, they're going after the people
[2985.00 --> 2986.96]  who might buy, you know, a MacBook, right?
[2987.92 --> 2990.24]  As long as I have at least the option
[2990.24 --> 2992.36]  to run any app that I would want to,
[2993.02 --> 2994.02]  this is,
[2994.22 --> 2997.02]  this makes ARM on a mobile device
[2997.02 --> 2997.70]  like a laptop,
[2998.20 --> 2998.80]  finally,
[2999.92 --> 3002.02]  kind of something that could get to me.
[3002.46 --> 3003.56]  Like, if I had a laptop
[3003.56 --> 3005.78]  that I only had to charge like once a week,
[3006.58 --> 3006.92]  huh,
[3007.54 --> 3008.80]  that would be amazing.
[3008.92 --> 3010.54]  You throw like a big fat,
[3010.62 --> 3012.92]  like 70 watt hour battery in this thing.
[3013.28 --> 3015.64]  And what is effectively a Snapdragon processor.
[3015.64 --> 3017.68]  Oh man.
[3018.42 --> 3018.68]  Like,
[3018.74 --> 3020.18]  like two days of screen time.
[3020.68 --> 3021.04]  Wow.
[3021.50 --> 3023.10]  I'd be super into that.
[3025.10 --> 3025.68]  All right.
[3025.84 --> 3026.62]  Should we do the bounty?
[3027.32 --> 3029.62]  I suspect just one quick thing
[3029.62 --> 3030.12]  before we go for it.
[3030.16 --> 3030.30]  Yeah.
[3030.34 --> 3031.68]  I think this is going to be super problematic.
[3032.70 --> 3034.48]  You just think it won't work very well?
[3034.98 --> 3035.20]  Yeah.
[3035.70 --> 3036.10]  Yeah.
[3036.28 --> 3037.06]  That wouldn't surprise me.
[3037.14 --> 3038.06]  I think that I,
[3038.12 --> 3038.58]  and I don't,
[3038.68 --> 3038.76]  I,
[3038.96 --> 3039.16]  okay.
[3039.26 --> 3040.46]  I was just about to say,
[3040.52 --> 3041.82]  I think they're going to do a bad job
[3041.82 --> 3042.64]  and I don't,
[3042.80 --> 3045.04]  I don't think that's actually necessarily the case.
[3045.04 --> 3046.04]  It's just really hard.
[3046.16 --> 3047.38]  I think the result is going to be bad.
[3047.54 --> 3047.76]  Yeah.
[3048.16 --> 3049.72]  Like they might do a great job
[3049.72 --> 3051.98]  and I still think it's probably going to be really rough.
[3052.10 --> 3052.24]  Yeah.
[3052.24 --> 3052.56]  I mean,
[3052.62 --> 3056.00]  also sometimes Microsoft's developers are not the best.
[3056.20 --> 3059.04]  Like what's up with that super tiny notification
[3059.04 --> 3060.14]  in the Teams app
[3060.14 --> 3062.26]  that indicates that you're not signed in.
[3062.26 --> 3063.30]  What's up with the Teams app?
[3063.42 --> 3063.62]  Yeah.
[3063.72 --> 3063.94]  Well,
[3064.74 --> 3064.92]  but,
[3064.98 --> 3065.10]  but,
[3065.22 --> 3065.66]  okay.
[3065.78 --> 3065.94]  Yeah.
[3066.00 --> 3066.82]  I can't,
[3067.12 --> 3067.70]  and like,
[3067.76 --> 3067.96]  okay,
[3067.96 --> 3069.54]  I don't use Teams all the time.
[3069.62 --> 3070.90]  I use it pretty infrequently,
[3071.30 --> 3072.86]  maybe like once a week.
[3072.86 --> 3076.26]  So I'm not exactly the greatest like Teams user use case thing,
[3076.58 --> 3079.08]  but sometimes it can take me like days
[3079.08 --> 3080.82]  to figure out I'm signed out of Teams.
[3081.34 --> 3081.56]  Yeah.
[3081.84 --> 3084.50]  Cause it's just this like tiny little yellow bar.
[3084.98 --> 3085.64]  It's yellow.
[3085.66 --> 3086.46]  I thought it was gray.
[3086.64 --> 3087.68]  Whatever color it is,
[3087.72 --> 3088.82]  it's not eye catching.
[3089.04 --> 3091.58]  And the entire app looks perfectly normal
[3091.58 --> 3093.38]  unless you try to send a message
[3093.38 --> 3093.78]  and it's like,
[3093.82 --> 3093.96]  oh,
[3094.02 --> 3094.74]  couldn't send.
[3095.64 --> 3096.82]  But if I remember correctly,
[3096.82 --> 3098.20]  it doesn't actually like say why.
[3098.62 --> 3098.98]  No,
[3099.30 --> 3100.08]  I don't think so.
[3100.74 --> 3101.38]  Couldn't send.
[3101.38 --> 3102.06]  And so you have to be like,
[3102.14 --> 3103.04]  oh crap,
[3103.12 --> 3103.96]  I'm signed out again.
[3104.60 --> 3104.96]  Unbelievable.
[3105.92 --> 3109.30]  I have fairly intense password security
[3109.30 --> 3111.14]  and it logs me out on my phone.
[3111.72 --> 3112.74]  All the time.
[3112.96 --> 3113.26]  All the time.
[3113.46 --> 3114.46]  It's so annoying.
[3114.94 --> 3117.86]  And things on my phone generally don't log me out on my phone.
[3117.88 --> 3118.64]  Like Slack,
[3118.84 --> 3119.22]  WhatsApp,
[3120.04 --> 3120.70]  Telegram.
[3121.08 --> 3123.76]  Like what are all the other messaging applications that I use
[3123.76 --> 3125.04]  that do for whatever reason,
[3125.04 --> 3127.04]  they don't need to log me out every 30 days.
[3127.48 --> 3127.88]  And we've been,
[3127.90 --> 3129.82]  we've been complaining to Microsoft about this
[3129.82 --> 3131.06]  ever since we made the switch.
[3131.06 --> 3133.06]  That was like a year ago.
[3133.66 --> 3134.06]  Like,
[3134.12 --> 3135.66]  what are you guys doing?
[3136.12 --> 3138.00]  Nobody else requires this.
[3138.98 --> 3139.98]  So annoying.
[3140.48 --> 3141.20]  Really rough.
[3141.30 --> 3141.58]  So like,
[3141.64 --> 3144.20]  I'm basically never logged into teams on my phone.
[3144.36 --> 3146.56]  So I don't get teams notifications on my phone,
[3146.66 --> 3149.66]  which is like hugely problematic in its own right.
[3150.10 --> 3151.40]  It's super annoying.
[3153.14 --> 3153.58]  Anyways,
[3153.70 --> 3153.96]  sorry.
[3154.14 --> 3154.40]  Bounty.
[3154.60 --> 3155.44]  Bounty time.
[3155.66 --> 3156.68]  Bounty time.
[3156.68 --> 3160.20]  I don't even know if I want this.
[3160.28 --> 3161.28]  Do I even want this thing?
[3161.34 --> 3162.26]  What even is this?
[3162.64 --> 3162.90]  I mean,
[3162.90 --> 3164.88]  you definitely don't have to commit to a bounty.
[3165.50 --> 3165.94]  There's,
[3165.94 --> 3166.96]  there's been cooler,
[3167.16 --> 3168.38]  weird cards that I've seen.
[3168.44 --> 3169.24]  I'll say that much.
[3169.36 --> 3169.78]  All right.
[3169.82 --> 3170.28]  All right.
[3170.46 --> 3171.34]  But I don't really,
[3171.68 --> 3174.42]  I don't really understand this.
[3174.42 --> 3179.84]  I don't really understand why this is like a not safe for work thing.
[3180.60 --> 3181.28]  Not safe for work.
[3181.38 --> 3181.68]  Yeah.
[3181.82 --> 3183.42]  If you click through to the,
[3183.42 --> 3184.94]  the like Reddit thread,
[3185.06 --> 3185.42]  it's like,
[3185.48 --> 3185.68]  Ooh,
[3185.74 --> 3186.84]  to everyone that loves AMD,
[3187.06 --> 3188.52]  ATI graphics cards,
[3188.74 --> 3189.80]  click to see not safe for work.
[3189.86 --> 3190.50]  It's just a graphics card.
[3190.50 --> 3193.12]  I bet you they're trying to be like,
[3193.22 --> 3193.52]  it's,
[3193.60 --> 3193.98]  it's,
[3194.28 --> 3194.82]  it's like,
[3195.16 --> 3195.94]  it's gore.
[3197.18 --> 3197.62]  Oh,
[3197.72 --> 3198.06]  okay.
[3198.06 --> 3198.60]  Very funny.
[3198.66 --> 3198.98]  I guess.
[3199.22 --> 3199.66]  I,
[3199.66 --> 3200.10]  yeah,
[3200.20 --> 3200.76]  I think they're,
[3200.82 --> 3201.76]  I think they're memeing on it.
[3201.86 --> 3204.32]  If your subreddit is called tech support gore,
[3204.42 --> 3205.10]  like you think,
[3205.34 --> 3205.50]  yeah,
[3205.56 --> 3206.04]  whatever.
[3206.16 --> 3206.58]  It doesn't matter.
[3206.66 --> 3207.40]  The point is,
[3207.46 --> 3207.74]  yeah.
[3208.14 --> 3211.94]  This is the HIS X 1600 pro dual DVI.
[3212.18 --> 3219.78]  It is a dual interface graphics card with both AGP here on the bottom and PCI express here on the top.
[3219.78 --> 3223.88]  This would be PCI express 1.0 or 1.1 or something like that way back in the day.
[3224.28 --> 3225.56]  If you have one of these,
[3225.56 --> 3227.16]  I'm not paying that much for this.
[3227.20 --> 3228.54]  This is really not worth a lot of money.
[3228.58 --> 3229.00]  I'll give you,
[3229.14 --> 3231.04]  I'll give you 250 bucks for it.
[3231.04 --> 3233.70]  We've also talked about this on the show before.
[3233.94 --> 3234.30]  Working.
[3234.46 --> 3235.30]  It has to be working.
[3235.92 --> 3236.76]  So get,
[3236.88 --> 3238.02]  get in touch with us.
[3238.26 --> 3238.34]  And,
[3238.40 --> 3238.72]  uh,
[3239.14 --> 3241.10]  even though I know nothing would happen,
[3241.10 --> 3245.00]  I would love to see someone try to try to boot,
[3245.08 --> 3246.10]  um,
[3246.40 --> 3249.72]  two computers that are like,
[3249.78 --> 3250.22]  on each end.
[3250.38 --> 3252.60]  The thumbnail for that would also be amazing.
[3253.50 --> 3253.94]  Yeah.
[3253.94 --> 3254.44]  That would,
[3254.58 --> 3256.84]  that would almost definitely break something.
[3257.80 --> 3259.08]  There's just no way.
[3259.44 --> 3260.24]  The card,
[3260.40 --> 3261.22]  probably the card,
[3261.30 --> 3262.06]  because if it's being,
[3262.42 --> 3264.58]  if it's receiving power through both slots,
[3264.58 --> 3266.10]  that would be probably bad.
[3267.10 --> 3268.38]  Maybe both motherboards.
[3268.48 --> 3268.56]  Like,
[3268.60 --> 3269.40]  I don't know how it would,
[3269.46 --> 3271.86]  because there's no way the engineers would have accounted for that.
[3272.00 --> 3272.36]  Like,
[3272.38 --> 3272.88]  that's the,
[3273.10 --> 3274.44]  that's not even an edge case.
[3274.44 --> 3275.28]  That's like a,
[3275.28 --> 3276.78]  that's like a senseless,
[3276.92 --> 3280.22]  needless destruction of our product case.
[3280.22 --> 3280.60]  Like,
[3281.56 --> 3282.00]  nah,
[3282.08 --> 3282.42]  dog,
[3282.64 --> 3282.84]  nah,
[3282.90 --> 3283.04]  dog.
[3285.04 --> 3285.70]  I just,
[3285.82 --> 3287.68]  I'm so curious what would happen.
[3287.88 --> 3288.32]  Tell you what,
[3288.38 --> 3289.12]  if we get one,
[3289.20 --> 3290.08]  I will,
[3290.16 --> 3292.28]  I will allow you to personally press the power button.
[3292.32 --> 3292.56]  Okay.
[3293.02 --> 3293.30]  Oh,
[3293.30 --> 3293.54]  geez.
[3293.62 --> 3293.88]  Okay.
[3293.88 --> 3296.84]  Robert male sent a super chat,
[3296.94 --> 3301.18]  rip the people who missed the first hour of the show over on float plane and Twitch.
[3301.54 --> 3301.98]  Yeah.
[3303.28 --> 3305.44]  We should start making the pre pre show,
[3305.44 --> 3306.04]  uh,
[3306.04 --> 3307.12]  like float plane exclusive.
[3307.36 --> 3308.20]  There's no real reason.
[3308.36 --> 3310.16]  Now that float plane streaming works better.
[3310.24 --> 3311.98]  There's no reason for us to have it on Twitch.
[3312.72 --> 3312.94]  Sorry,
[3313.04 --> 3313.36]  Twitch.
[3313.72 --> 3314.54]  Get wrecked.
[3314.58 --> 3315.18]  I haven't decided.
[3315.24 --> 3315.70]  I haven't decided.
[3315.80 --> 3317.08]  Maybe we'll continue to do it on Twitch.
[3317.08 --> 3321.24]  The main reason we don't have it on YouTube is because we don't want to send out a notification
[3321.24 --> 3322.96]  and then realize we have like audio problems.
[3322.96 --> 3323.60]  Uh,
[3323.64 --> 3323.84]  Dylan,
[3323.98 --> 3324.28]  Dylan,
[3324.50 --> 3325.72]  Dylan Kessel says,
[3325.84 --> 3329.66]  what would you choose between a 144 Hertz,
[3330.12 --> 3330.64]  um,
[3330.68 --> 3336.00]  1080p monitor for $500 or a valve index for a thousand dollars?
[3336.20 --> 3338.72]  I currently have a 1080.
[3338.92 --> 3340.04]  I guess that's your graphics card.
[3340.08 --> 3342.16]  You're talking about and two 60 Hertz monitors,
[3342.26 --> 3343.04]  man.
[3343.12 --> 3343.22]  Well,
[3343.22 --> 3346.18]  you don't have to go like full ham index.
[3346.40 --> 3347.04]  And like,
[3347.08 --> 3348.06]  and what do you do?
[3348.60 --> 3349.74]  What do you want to do?
[3349.84 --> 3350.10]  Yeah.
[3350.10 --> 3351.08]  Like if you want to,
[3351.08 --> 3351.54]  like,
[3351.62 --> 3351.92]  you know,
[3351.92 --> 3355.78]  if you want to pull an Anthony and like start playing beat saber every day and like lose
[3355.78 --> 3356.18]  some weight,
[3356.28 --> 3358.14]  like then you should probably get a VR headset.
[3358.58 --> 3360.94]  But like index is very overkill.
[3360.98 --> 3362.48]  Like I think Anthony was trying,
[3362.58 --> 3365.02]  he had cheaped out on a bunch of other stuff in his home upgrade setup.
[3365.02 --> 3366.66]  And he was like trying to go index.
[3366.66 --> 3367.20]  And I was like,
[3367.26 --> 3367.46]  dude,
[3367.54 --> 3367.84]  no,
[3368.32 --> 3369.00]  just here,
[3369.18 --> 3370.48]  I have my old vibe.
[3370.54 --> 3371.06]  Cause like,
[3371.56 --> 3373.34]  you don't even know if you're going to use it a ton.
[3373.40 --> 3377.84]  That's like buying a Peloton bike and not even knowing if like,
[3377.92 --> 3378.30]  you know,
[3379.24 --> 3381.06]  you like riding a bike at all,
[3381.14 --> 3381.44]  you know,
[3381.48 --> 3382.12]  like just get,
[3382.12 --> 3387.62]  just get something on Craigslist and find out if you even like it and then invest a bunch of money into it.
[3387.62 --> 3387.80]  Right.
[3391.06 --> 3391.76]  Meaningless says,
[3391.92 --> 3395.80]  please don't ever forget to tell those in your life how much you love them and how grateful you are for them.
[3395.90 --> 3397.74]  You never know how long you have with them.
[3398.24 --> 3400.98]  I just buried my three and a half year old son three weeks ago.
[3401.88 --> 3402.20]  Wow.
[3403.10 --> 3403.46]  Um,
[3404.10 --> 3405.92]  I am very sorry to hear that.
[3405.98 --> 3409.34]  I had started reading that message before I had finished reading the end of it.
[3409.52 --> 3412.52]  So I guess my tone didn't make a ton of sense at the beginning of that.
[3412.60 --> 3414.16]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[3414.66 --> 3416.02]  I'm also sorry to hear that,
[3416.12 --> 3416.38]  man.
[3416.42 --> 3416.98]  It's like,
[3417.60 --> 3418.22]  I don't even,
[3418.34 --> 3418.48]  yeah,
[3418.50 --> 3418.94]  I don't even,
[3419.20 --> 3421.24]  I don't even like to imagine it.
[3421.34 --> 3423.40]  Sometimes when I go into my kid's room,
[3423.40 --> 3423.92]  just to,
[3424.14 --> 3426.34]  I go into my kid's room at night just to see them sleeping.
[3426.52 --> 3427.04]  I don't know,
[3427.12 --> 3427.38]  whatever.
[3427.88 --> 3428.06]  They're,
[3428.12 --> 3428.76]  they're little kids.
[3429.08 --> 3430.08]  If they were teenagers,
[3430.08 --> 3431.08]  that would be a little weirder.
[3431.46 --> 3431.82]  Um,
[3431.94 --> 3434.58]  but for now I go in at night.
[3434.64 --> 3436.54]  Sometimes I just go and make sure they're okay.
[3436.54 --> 3436.88]  You know,
[3436.94 --> 3440.24]  and every once in a while they'll be sleeping really,
[3440.56 --> 3442.42]  really deeply and they'll be breathing really,
[3442.52 --> 3443.08]  really slowly.
[3443.08 --> 3444.44]  And I have these panic moments.
[3445.32 --> 3446.26]  Is your chest moving?
[3448.06 --> 3448.46]  Oh,
[3448.58 --> 3449.06]  it is.
[3449.14 --> 3449.30]  Okay.
[3450.46 --> 3453.26]  Sometimes I have to get real close to like make sure.
[3453.60 --> 3455.80]  And then once I panic about one of them,
[3455.82 --> 3457.00]  I have to check all of them.
[3457.14 --> 3458.24]  Like they're all breathing,
[3458.34 --> 3458.58]  right?
[3458.96 --> 3459.48]  Cause like,
[3459.48 --> 3461.32]  that's your worst nightmare as a parent.
[3461.46 --> 3461.64]  Yeah.
[3461.74 --> 3462.42]  Sorry to hear that,
[3462.50 --> 3462.66]  man.
[3464.48 --> 3464.88]  Um,
[3466.34 --> 3466.66]  Tommy.
[3466.90 --> 3467.50]  On a lighter note,
[3467.76 --> 3468.10]  uh,
[3468.10 --> 3468.56]  someone,
[3468.90 --> 3469.06]  when,
[3469.14 --> 3469.52]  when we,
[3469.64 --> 3470.62]  when we said the light,
[3470.70 --> 3472.82]  when I said the screw you Twitch nerds,
[3472.82 --> 3475.10]  and we said potentially doing the pre-show just on flow plane,
[3475.34 --> 3478.94]  one of the Twitch comments that I thought was funny was just in all caps.
[3478.94 --> 3479.46]  We made,
[3479.58 --> 3481.06]  we made you who you are today.
[3483.20 --> 3483.60]  No,
[3483.68 --> 3483.94]  you didn't.
[3483.94 --> 3484.54]  I didn't.
[3485.22 --> 3486.18]  Not so much.
[3487.92 --> 3489.06]  We love you guys.
[3489.12 --> 3489.78]  We love you guys.
[3489.78 --> 3490.46]  You got spunk.
[3490.96 --> 3491.66]  You got spunk.
[3491.86 --> 3492.06]  You know?
[3492.22 --> 3492.42]  Yeah.
[3492.62 --> 3493.06]  Uh,
[3493.06 --> 3493.94]  you got moxie.
[3494.62 --> 3494.88]  Uh,
[3494.94 --> 3495.88]  Tommy gun asks,
[3496.00 --> 3496.34]  uh,
[3496.34 --> 3496.78]  when,
[3496.78 --> 3496.80]  when,
[3496.92 --> 3498.84]  when will your main rig get a 30 90?
[3499.36 --> 3500.32]  I don't know.
[3500.44 --> 3504.88]  The only game I've played in the last like two weeks has been among us,
[3504.88 --> 3506.48]  which ain't exactly demanding.
[3506.76 --> 3509.58]  And then the next game I'm planning to play is left for dead too.
[3509.94 --> 3513.32]  So the reason I even upgraded to a 2080 TI,
[3513.54 --> 3515.06]  like what was I even running before?
[3515.54 --> 3516.16]  It was,
[3516.34 --> 3517.88]  I think it was like a Titan X,
[3518.88 --> 3520.46]  like first gen Titan X or something like that.
[3520.50 --> 3522.26]  Like I hadn't upgraded in a long time.
[3522.38 --> 3524.56]  And the only reason I moved to,
[3524.58 --> 3525.06]  uh,
[3525.08 --> 3527.74]  to anything better was actually because,
[3527.74 --> 3528.28]  uh,
[3528.30 --> 3528.72]  of Anno.
[3528.84 --> 3531.32]  1800 and I'm not really playing Anno anymore.
[3531.80 --> 3532.24]  So,
[3532.90 --> 3533.44]  um,
[3533.70 --> 3534.16]  yeah,
[3534.54 --> 3534.80]  I,
[3534.94 --> 3535.22]  I,
[3535.22 --> 3535.38]  I,
[3535.38 --> 3537.98]  it'll be when I have a game that I like really need to play.
[3538.04 --> 3539.00]  That's actually demanding.
[3540.52 --> 3541.00]  Uh,
[3541.16 --> 3545.68]  Theorica says a humorous version of Colton's pie chart for new shirt merge.
[3546.12 --> 3546.50]  Oh,
[3546.56 --> 3547.56]  that would be kind of,
[3547.80 --> 3548.06]  okay.
[3548.06 --> 3552.06]  Once we have the integration that Luke's team is working on between float plane
[3552.06 --> 3552.78]  and,
[3552.78 --> 3553.36]  uh,
[3553.36 --> 3554.02]  creator warehouse,
[3554.26 --> 3555.86]  which is our merch company.
[3555.98 --> 3556.46]  Uh,
[3556.46 --> 3557.38]  once we have that,
[3557.38 --> 3564.30]  we could totally do small runs because what prevents us right now from doing limited edition,
[3564.30 --> 3568.30]  like very small runs of shirts is not actually the cost or the logistics.
[3568.30 --> 3568.72]  Really?
[3568.82 --> 3570.42]  Like we've got the workflow pretty down.
[3570.42 --> 3576.74]  Like we do tens of thousands of shirts these days and doing a hundred and something is no big deal.
[3576.74 --> 3585.32]  The problem is that it creates all kinds of customer support problems when you don't preprint them because people don't read and they don't understand.
[3585.32 --> 3589.98]  So if what we're doing is something that's just for the hard course,
[3589.98 --> 3596.90]  we can count on them to understand that this is going to take two or three weeks because that's how long the process takes of getting a shirt order in,
[3597.20 --> 3598.08]  getting into the printer,
[3598.58 --> 3599.46]  quality checking,
[3599.88 --> 3602.66]  forwarding from the printer to our distribution center,
[3602.66 --> 3604.36]  and then it actually shipping out.
[3604.44 --> 3604.78]  That's just,
[3604.84 --> 3605.80]  that's just how long it takes.
[3606.36 --> 3606.68]  Um,
[3606.72 --> 3607.24]  so yeah,
[3607.24 --> 3607.54]  if,
[3607.76 --> 3608.50]  if you guys,
[3608.64 --> 3610.74]  if you guys wanted to do stuff like that,
[3610.76 --> 3612.60]  we could totally do it.
[3612.74 --> 3613.36]  A hundred percent.
[3613.62 --> 3615.96]  We could even have like fan submitted designs,
[3616.06 --> 3616.44]  be like,
[3616.48 --> 3616.66]  you know,
[3616.80 --> 3617.08]  you know,
[3617.08 --> 3618.06]  shirt design contest.
[3618.20 --> 3618.28]  Yeah.
[3618.30 --> 3618.78]  We'll give you,
[3618.96 --> 3620.66]  we'll give you 500 bucks or whatever.
[3620.66 --> 3621.60]  If you design a shirt,
[3621.66 --> 3622.44]  we'll turn around and,
[3622.62 --> 3622.72]  you know,
[3622.72 --> 3623.54]  make a hundred of them.
[3624.44 --> 3626.10]  We'd totally be into that kind of thing.
[3626.46 --> 3626.78]  Um,
[3626.78 --> 3634.64]  but we'd have to be able to lock it down so that the general population doesn't have access to it because it would just generate a ton of support tickets.
[3634.64 --> 3635.02]  And we,
[3635.16 --> 3637.86]  that would cost us more than we would make on the shirt.
[3637.96 --> 3639.84]  And that's just the reality of that type of business.
[3642.08 --> 3642.48]  Uh,
[3642.54 --> 3647.56]  Nate says you should schedule the WAN show on YouTube so we can sit in a waiting area and have the show auto start when the stream starts.
[3647.86 --> 3648.24]  No,
[3648.28 --> 3650.42]  I shouldn't just in case we're super late.
[3650.42 --> 3653.80]  Jacob Callahan says,
[3653.90 --> 3655.80]  I bought your shirt three sizes too small.
[3655.90 --> 3656.96]  And when I asked you guys for help,
[3657.00 --> 3659.36]  I got everything small and larger,
[3659.52 --> 3661.62]  no extra plus free packs of zip ties.
[3661.78 --> 3662.92]  Love your customer service.
[3663.62 --> 3666.30]  I bought your shirt three sizes too small.
[3666.38 --> 3667.34]  When I asked you guys for help,
[3667.38 --> 3669.94]  I got everything small and larger,
[3670.70 --> 3672.18]  everything small and larger.
[3672.38 --> 3673.34]  I know,
[3673.56 --> 3674.68]  no extra plus.
[3674.78 --> 3676.02]  I don't understand what you're talking about,
[3676.08 --> 3677.08]  but apparently you're happy.
[3677.78 --> 3678.18]  Good.
[3678.24 --> 3678.68]  Heck yeah.
[3680.12 --> 3680.40]  Awesome.
[3680.42 --> 3681.08]  Success.
[3683.78 --> 3684.22]  Uh,
[3684.30 --> 3684.66]  okay.
[3685.08 --> 3685.78]  Calvin says,
[3685.86 --> 3688.10]  don't really see the purpose of higher performance flagship phones.
[3688.20 --> 3689.08]  My note eight runs fine.
[3689.20 --> 3689.38]  Yeah.
[3689.58 --> 3690.02]  Fair point,
[3690.10 --> 3690.28]  man.
[3690.40 --> 3693.30]  I'm running the note nine and I'm still pretty into it.
[3693.74 --> 3695.60]  Like five G is,
[3695.70 --> 3701.00]  I'm going to have to wait until there's like some compelling killer app for it.
[3701.00 --> 3701.60]  Cause like,
[3701.64 --> 3701.76]  yeah,
[3701.76 --> 3702.92]  it's faster and that's good.
[3702.92 --> 3705.16]  And it's great to like,
[3705.16 --> 3706.16]  it's great to have,
[3706.32 --> 3706.68]  you know,
[3706.76 --> 3707.62]  better tech.
[3707.62 --> 3708.74]  Like if I was buying a phone today,
[3708.74 --> 3710.18]  I'd probably want one with five G.
[3710.28 --> 3710.40]  Yeah,
[3710.46 --> 3710.64]  sure.
[3711.08 --> 3713.50]  But if I'm not buying a phone today,
[3713.50 --> 3715.56]  I'm not going to run out and buy one just for five G.
[3716.24 --> 3716.38]  No.
[3717.26 --> 3718.12]  Sachifu says,
[3718.44 --> 3718.72]  Linus,
[3718.76 --> 3720.42]  you're not an evil mega rich corporation.
[3720.80 --> 3721.78]  That's why this is worth it.
[3721.80 --> 3724.30]  And a subscription based phone is not hashtag.
[3724.46 --> 3726.44]  Cancel Linus hashtag early retirement.
[3726.44 --> 3729.44]  I don't know what these hashtags are after here,
[3729.54 --> 3730.98]  but thank you for that.
[3731.12 --> 3733.60]  I think you're not an evil corporation.
[3734.58 --> 3736.24]  I'm going to cancel you anyways.
[3736.72 --> 3738.38]  I'm definitely a corporation.
[3738.60 --> 3740.10]  As for how rich I am,
[3740.18 --> 3743.66]  there's people over on float plane taking a shot at it in the comments under the,
[3743.76 --> 3744.82]  how does LMG make money?
[3744.94 --> 3745.38]  Uh,
[3745.42 --> 3746.18]  V2 video.
[3746.40 --> 3748.50]  It's been interesting for me to read through them.
[3748.82 --> 3749.66]  Very interesting.
[3749.80 --> 3751.76]  I've seen some very wrong stuff.
[3751.76 --> 3752.74]  I was going to say,
[3752.86 --> 3755.48]  I haven't looked too deeply through them,
[3755.54 --> 3760.72]  but I've seen a few and there's some flawed logic there,
[3760.82 --> 3761.72]  but it was,
[3761.76 --> 3763.20]  there's some good effort.
[3763.46 --> 3765.28]  There's some eight plus for effort going on there.
[3765.56 --> 3766.38]  And like with,
[3766.48 --> 3767.88]  with the information that they have,
[3767.92 --> 3768.22]  I think,
[3768.48 --> 3769.34]  yeah,
[3769.38 --> 3770.28]  they're doing a really good job,
[3770.36 --> 3770.50]  but.
[3771.82 --> 3772.30]  Oh,
[3772.34 --> 3772.62]  wow.
[3773.12 --> 3777.30]  After hearing four weeks of evidence in the extradition trial of Julian Assange,
[3777.76 --> 3778.78]  district judge,
[3778.86 --> 3779.22]  Vanessa,
[3779.64 --> 3781.74]  I don't know how to pronounce that announced on Thursday that,
[3781.74 --> 3783.66]  she'll pronounce judgment on January the 4th.
[3784.46 --> 3784.86]  Interesting.
[3786.00 --> 3786.68]  Oh boy.
[3789.62 --> 3790.06]  Uh,
[3790.32 --> 3791.36]  it's a huge cap.
[3791.56 --> 3791.88]  Why?
[3793.36 --> 3793.84]  Uh,
[3793.92 --> 3794.66]  Damien says,
[3794.74 --> 3795.24]  if YouTube,
[3795.40 --> 3797.32]  if cast YouTube music to my Google home,
[3797.36 --> 3799.00]  I can't shuffle playlists from a song.
[3799.20 --> 3799.40]  Yeah.
[3799.50 --> 3799.90]  Shuffle.
[3799.90 --> 3802.26]  It's like super stupid in the YouTube music app.
[3802.44 --> 3804.56]  Why are you getting me going on the YouTube music app again?
[3804.84 --> 3806.04]  It is so unintuitive.
[3806.50 --> 3808.58]  Shuffle is something that there's,
[3808.58 --> 3810.68]  there's only two correct ways to do shuffle.
[3810.88 --> 3811.22]  Okay.
[3811.22 --> 3813.90]  Way number one is when I press the shuffle button,
[3814.08 --> 3816.66]  it continues playing the song that I'm playing until it's done.
[3816.84 --> 3819.52]  And then randomizes everything from there on.
[3820.00 --> 3821.04]  And way number two.
[3821.12 --> 3821.20]  Oh,
[3821.24 --> 3821.84]  and it toggles.
[3821.98 --> 3824.44]  There's an indicator to show that it is enabled.
[3824.94 --> 3825.12]  Way number.
[3825.12 --> 3825.98]  So like highlighted,
[3826.20 --> 3827.52]  like your speakerphone or something would.
[3827.76 --> 3831.94]  Way number two is that it goes into my now playing list.
[3832.04 --> 3835.56]  It dumps everything that I shuffled into my now playing list in a random order.
[3835.56 --> 3838.10]  And then puts it on repeat all.
[3838.86 --> 3839.38]  That is,
[3839.46 --> 3840.24]  that is correct.
[3840.32 --> 3840.90]  Way number two.
[3840.90 --> 3842.42]  If it's anything other than that,
[3842.60 --> 3843.42]  it's not correct.
[3844.20 --> 3844.72]  That's it.
[3844.72 --> 3847.32]  Oh no.
[3847.32 --> 3848.60]  ZTO says,
[3848.68 --> 3849.54]  I wouldn't switch to Shopify.
[3849.54 --> 3849.90]  Uh,
[3849.90 --> 3850.40]  to Spotify.
[3850.60 --> 3850.98]  If I were you,
[3851.04 --> 3851.84]  the shuffle is broken.
[3852.48 --> 3855.42]  I keep hearing the same 50 songs out of a thousand plus song playlist.
[3855.62 --> 3856.06]  No,
[3856.70 --> 3858.14]  because I only have one playlist.
[3858.38 --> 3859.02]  I'm one of those people.
[3859.02 --> 3859.88]  That's just like thumbs up,
[3859.94 --> 3860.22]  thumbs up,
[3860.28 --> 3860.60]  thumbs up.
[3860.64 --> 3862.12]  And then I'd only play my thumbs up.
[3862.18 --> 3862.82]  Like I don't,
[3863.04 --> 3865.42]  who has time to like micromanage playlists?
[3865.42 --> 3867.68]  Oh man.
[3869.24 --> 3870.28]  Northern rebel says,
[3870.36 --> 3873.58]  what are your thoughts on EK prebuilt computers?
[3873.72 --> 3875.30]  Do they have prebuilt systems?
[3879.02 --> 3879.54]  No.
[3881.72 --> 3882.64]  EK fluid gaming.com.
[3883.10 --> 3883.94]  Look at that.
[3884.88 --> 3886.32]  EK is a system integrator now.
[3886.86 --> 3887.10]  Huh?
[3887.92 --> 3888.10]  Well,
[3888.12 --> 3888.52]  good for them.
[3888.66 --> 3888.76]  I mean,
[3888.84 --> 3890.38]  it looks pretty sharp,
[3890.56 --> 3891.54]  but it looks dated.
[3892.46 --> 3892.90]  Yeah.
[3892.90 --> 3894.12]  I don't really have any thoughts on that.
[3894.12 --> 3896.00]  Cause I found out for the first time just now,
[3896.08 --> 3898.84]  I don't see any reason why they couldn't like build a computer,
[3898.84 --> 3899.28]  I guess.
[3899.40 --> 3899.92]  I mean,
[3899.92 --> 3902.48]  really what it's going to come down to is customer service,
[3902.58 --> 3903.10]  obviously.
[3903.74 --> 3904.14]  Um,
[3904.26 --> 3907.94]  and EK has definitely had some missteps,
[3907.94 --> 3910.64]  but they've by enlarged managed to by enlarged,
[3910.78 --> 3913.88]  by enlarged managed to maintain their reputation over the years.
[3914.12 --> 3918.54]  So I suspect they would do a great job of the like water cooling and
[3918.54 --> 3918.82]  shipping.
[3919.12 --> 3919.56]  Yeah,
[3919.58 --> 3919.98]  probably.
[3921.30 --> 3923.32]  And they certainly know their shiz as far as that goes.
[3923.88 --> 3924.06]  Yeah.
[3924.12 --> 3926.00]  So like,
[3926.06 --> 3926.58]  that's cool.
[3929.04 --> 3929.74]  All right.
[3929.92 --> 3931.66]  That's pretty much it for the WAN show.
[3931.80 --> 3934.14]  Really appreciate you guys tuning in.
[3934.24 --> 3935.50]  We will see you again next week.
[3935.78 --> 3936.86]  Same bat time,
[3937.16 --> 3938.22]  same bat channel.
[3938.90 --> 3939.30]  Goodbye.
[3939.30 --> 3939.50]  Bye.
[3939.50 --> 3939.54]  Bye.
[3948.80 --> 3951.78]  WAN show had a crazy number of live viewers to make.
[3951.88 --> 3953.04]  We're at like 25,000.
[3953.04 --> 3955.04]  That's a lot for WAN show.
[3955.54 --> 3955.74]  Yeah,
[3955.78 --> 3955.96]  I know.
[3956.00 --> 3956.18]  Right.
[3956.72 --> 3958.26]  Like 20 K over on YouTube,
[3958.52 --> 3959.30]  another 4 K,
[3959.38 --> 3961.00]  even though we were dissing for Twitch,
[3961.22 --> 3962.38]  another 4 K over there.
[3962.50 --> 3963.10]  And then let's go.
[3963.10 --> 3963.36]  Thanks.
[3964.66 --> 3965.50]  Poor Twitch.
[3966.06 --> 3966.50]  Crazy.
[3966.50 --> 3968.54]  It's hard to be Twitch,
[3968.62 --> 3968.78]  man.
[3968.84 --> 3969.34]  Think about it.
