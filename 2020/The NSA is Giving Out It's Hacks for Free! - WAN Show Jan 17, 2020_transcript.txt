[0.00 --> 5.90]  Sorry, that's fine. I just wanted to note that feature request because it's good. Uh an error occur an error occurred
[5.90 --> 7.90]  Please try again later
[8.08 --> 15.22]  But also it says live and excellent condition. I love this so much. Uh, hey Jake. Oh
[16.38 --> 20.70]  He wandered off. Okay. I'm just gonna say I think this is probably the quickest way for me to do this
[20.70 --> 26.00]  I'm just gonna snap a quick picture of this because this is hilarious. We have a we have a call with them
[26.00 --> 31.20]  Uh probably next week like we actually have a contact at YouTube. It's like
[31.68 --> 34.14]  actively working on the development of this panel and
[35.40 --> 40.28]  Yeah, we must be hard right now. We were like straight up honest with them
[40.28 --> 46.12]  We were like look the way that it's so confusing to use because the way it messages things is terrible
[46.12 --> 51.44]  Yeah, like it's undecipherable and so me getting like excellent connection live by the way. There's a problem
[51.68 --> 54.16]  You can't you can't do that. Anyway, we're live
[54.16 --> 59.28]  Well, we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[59.44 --> 65.22]  The NSA has revealed a major flaw in Microsoft's Windows operating system
[65.48 --> 70.46]  Apple may be forced to ditch the lightning connector Luke got banned by Blizzard
[70.46 --> 72.46]  That's a major topic
[72.82 --> 77.10]  Well, I'm fascinated to hear about it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great story
[77.54 --> 81.78]  And you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here Windows 7 is
[81.78 --> 85.40]  Dead dead as a doornail dead as
[86.06 --> 92.28]  I mean, you can still use it. Yeah, you can still use it but like people used XP for a long time
[92.28 --> 98.90]  They did they shouldn't anymore. No. Yeah, but you should really not boot a Windows XP operating system on your network
[98.90 --> 100.90]  Yeah, yeah
[100.90 --> 102.90]  Let's roll that intro
[106.90 --> 108.90]  Oh, yeah
[108.90 --> 110.90]  Kind of hand
[112.90 --> 114.90]  Oh
[114.90 --> 116.90]  It's still
[116.90 --> 121.78]  I forgot to do public. Well, whatever
[121.78 --> 123.70]  We're not starting over
[123.70 --> 124.90]  Uh
[124.90 --> 127.52]  Sponsors for the show today
[127.52 --> 129.44]  That just my
[129.44 --> 131.10]  That humble bundle
[131.10 --> 133.18]  That fresh book. Oh, what's up?
[133.18 --> 138.64]  Oh, you've got to be kidding me. I forgot about that. Oh, wow crap. Um
[138.64 --> 139.64]  Wow
[139.64 --> 142.64]  I can talk about Apple being forced to ditch lightning
[142.64 --> 146.64]  Oh, I want to talk about that though. Okay. Uh, when do we need to do that?
[146.64 --> 148.64]  Just how long is it? I don't know
[148.64 --> 153.64]  Okay, can you can you find that out? Like how set up is it? If I can as long as I can just sprint over there
[153.64 --> 156.76]  Say it and then run back over here. We should be fine
[157.48 --> 160.64]  All right, so why don't we jump right into our headline topic?
[160.64 --> 167.64]  The NSA reveals a major flaw in Microsoft Windows at a press conference the US National Security Agency
[167.64 --> 173.64]  Everyone's best friend announced that I mean, you know, you can fight everything to your best friends
[173.64 --> 177.64]  Yeah, you know your best friend is always kind of like hanging around watching out for you
[177.64 --> 184.14]  Very very closely, you know your best friend puts listening devices in your home
[184.14 --> 191.14]  Uh, anyway, the NSA announced it has discovered a major flaw in Windows 10
[191.14 --> 192.14]  It's normal, right?
[192.14 --> 196.14]  Uh, it's not clear how long they knew about the vulnerability before revealing it to Microsoft
[196.14 --> 200.14]  But the bugs revealed were within Windows Remote Desktop Gateway code
[200.14 --> 201.14]  Okay, how? That's not good
[201.14 --> 203.14]  Remote Desktop
[203.14 --> 204.14]  Riddle me this
[204.14 --> 205.14]  Okay
[205.14 --> 208.14]  You know a thing or two about online security, right?
[208.14 --> 209.14]  Uh, sure
[209.14 --> 212.14]  Okay, you probably know enough to know this
[212.14 --> 213.14]  Okay
[213.14 --> 217.14]  If there's anything in your operating system that needs to be bulletproof
[217.14 --> 218.14]  Yeah, yep
[218.14 --> 226.14]  Wouldn't you think it would be the one that literally gives you as though you are sitting in front of it access to the machine?
[226.14 --> 227.14]  Yeah
[227.14 --> 230.14]  Can I take a quick aside here for a second?
[230.14 --> 232.14]  You just asked you know a thing or two about online security
[232.14 --> 233.14]  Yeah
[233.14 --> 235.14]  There's a bone that I have to pick with some of our audience
[235.14 --> 236.14]  Oh
[236.14 --> 238.14]  That has been picked by AJ
[238.14 --> 241.14]  But then after it has been picked by AJ they just tend to vanish
[241.14 --> 242.14]  Yes
[242.14 --> 244.14]  And then they come back later when AJ's not around and they attack again
[244.14 --> 245.14]  Yes
[245.14 --> 246.14]  And then AJ's like hey I see you
[246.14 --> 247.14]  Is this float plane related?
[247.14 --> 248.14]  It is
[248.14 --> 249.14]  Okay, what are they mad about now?
[249.14 --> 251.14]  So we have a maximum character count on our passwords
[251.14 --> 252.14]  Yeah, okay
[252.14 --> 254.14]  It's like 72 or something
[254.14 --> 256.14]  I don't remember what it is
[256.14 --> 257.14]  It's really high
[257.14 --> 258.14]  Okay
[258.14 --> 261.14]  Some people try to set passwords that are higher than that
[261.14 --> 266.14]  And then point at other websites and say like you can do it there that means better security
[268.14 --> 272.14]  A lot of really good encryption protocols can only go up to a certain amount
[272.14 --> 273.14]  Right
[273.14 --> 276.14]  You can allow it to accept passwords that are beyond that amount
[276.14 --> 277.14]  Right
[277.14 --> 281.14]  But it will just cut them off at 72 or whatever the character count is
[281.14 --> 282.14]  Really?
[282.14 --> 283.14]  It just slices it off
[283.14 --> 285.14]  So if you go to like Hacker News
[286.14 --> 289.14]  You can put in a password that's really long
[289.14 --> 295.14]  And then you can go up to the character count limit and just type whatever you want past the end and it doesn't matter
[295.14 --> 297.14]  That's not better security
[297.14 --> 298.14]  Come on
[298.14 --> 302.14]  I'm not like an absolute expert of this stuff but this is not difficult to understand
[302.14 --> 303.14]  And like
[303.14 --> 304.14]  Also 72 is lots
[304.14 --> 306.14]  I don't remember exactly what it is
[306.14 --> 307.14]  Okay, whatever
[307.14 --> 308.14]  It's very high
[308.14 --> 309.14]  Yeah, okay
[309.14 --> 310.14]  It's it's lots
[310.14 --> 311.14]  Yeah, okay
[311.14 --> 313.14]  Anyways, that's just you know, I just
[313.14 --> 314.14]  Ugh
[314.14 --> 315.14]  Thanks Luke
[315.14 --> 316.14]  We get very aggressive tweets every once in a while
[316.14 --> 318.14]  Someone be like this is unacceptable
[318.14 --> 319.14]  How's your chest?
[319.14 --> 320.14]  Does it feel lighter?
[320.14 --> 321.14]  My chest?
[321.14 --> 322.14]  Yeah, a little bit
[324.14 --> 326.14]  Anyways, back to NSA and Windows
[326.14 --> 329.14]  Alright, so the vulnerability in Windows Remote Desktop
[329.14 --> 336.14]  Like the one thing you gotta go through with a fine tooth, you know, like a lice comb, you know?
[336.14 --> 337.14]  And is like
[337.14 --> 338.14]  Get in there
[338.14 --> 339.14]  Definitely included on server versions
[339.14 --> 344.14]  So there's two separate bugs identified as CVE2020-06-09
[344.14 --> 346.14]  Nice
[346.14 --> 349.14]  And CVE2020-06-10
[349.14 --> 356.14]  They are particularly dangerous as while they are not yet exploited they could be used to remotely execute code on targeted RDP servers
[356.14 --> 360.14]  Before the gateway even attempts to authenticate them
[360.14 --> 361.14]  Nice
[361.14 --> 364.14]  The public disclosure represents a major change in the NSA's approach
[364.14 --> 368.14]  Choosing to put computer security ahead of building up its arsenal of hacking tools
[368.14 --> 371.14]  That allow the agency to spy on adversaries networks
[371.14 --> 375.14]  Past bugs like this were stockpiled by the NSA as attack vectors
[375.14 --> 377.14]  But eventually leaked to hacking groups for malicious use
[377.14 --> 380.14]  Notably EternalBlue and WannaCry
[380.14 --> 387.14]  Microsoft and the NSA reported that they have seen no active exploitation of the flaw
[387.14 --> 390.14]  And the latest Windows patch addresses 48 vulnerabilities
[390.14 --> 393.14]  Five of which were related to Windows Remote Desktop
[393.14 --> 400.14]  Okay, apparently I have to run over there and just yell at the microphone for about 20 seconds
[400.14 --> 406.14]  Long story short, there's a product coming out and we filmed our review
[406.14 --> 410.14]  And then a competitor has a product that competes with this product
[410.14 --> 415.14]  And they adjusted their pricing like an hour and a half ago
[415.14 --> 419.14]  And our video is already shot so I have to go and like do something
[419.14 --> 421.14]  Are you just like ghetto voice-overing?
[421.14 --> 423.14]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, so hard
[423.14 --> 424.14]  Nice, so hard
[424.14 --> 427.14]  I actually really enjoy that when you watch a video and there's like clearly like
[427.14 --> 431.14]  They clearly said something the first time and there's like say he says $95
[431.14 --> 435.14]  And he's like $150 and it goes back to the cadence that was there before
[435.14 --> 437.14]  I don't know why but I find that highly entertaining
[437.14 --> 442.14]  Not gonna lie, I wasn't fully paying attention to what Linus was saying before he left
[442.14 --> 444.14]  So I don't actually remember where he was on this
[444.14 --> 445.14]  So I'm just gonna pick it up
[445.14 --> 448.14]  And if I'm reiterating what he said previously, I apologize
[448.14 --> 453.14]  The public disclosure represents a major change in the NSA's approach
[453.14 --> 456.14]  Choosing to put computer security, oh he did say this
[456.14 --> 460.14]  Ahead of building up his arsenal of hacking tools that allow the agency to spy on adversaries networks
[460.14 --> 466.14]  This is good because I can pretty much bet you at least some of their systems are running on Windows
[466.14 --> 471.14]  I know for a fact that a decent amount of the American government systems in general
[471.14 --> 473.14]  Even if they're not the NSA's are running on Windows
[473.14 --> 480.14]  And I mean things are better secure than insecure
[480.14 --> 486.14]  If you set up a way to access something in an unauthorized way
[486.14 --> 489.14]  That can also be used as an attack vector always
[489.14 --> 492.14]  Like you can't just know that it will be used by yourself
[492.14 --> 495.14]  So yeah, getting this fixed is good overall
[495.14 --> 500.14]  Microsoft and the NSA reported that they have seen no active exploitation of the flaw
[500.14 --> 503.14]  That's great, I hope they get it fixed before that happens
[503.14 --> 507.14]  The latest Windows patch which we downloaded and installed on the streaming computer
[507.14 --> 510.14]  Right before the stream and I was scared that the stream wasn't going to work
[510.14 --> 512.14]  The latest Windows patch addressed 48 vulnerabilities
[512.14 --> 515.14]  Five of which were related to Windows Remote Desktop
[515.14 --> 517.14]  That is terrifying
[517.14 --> 519.14]  I am still extremely uncomfortable with Windows 10
[519.14 --> 521.14]  I've talked about it a ton on this show in the past
[521.14 --> 524.14]  I am running Windows 10 personally at home now
[524.14 --> 531.14]  The thing that usually ends up getting me to push operating systems ends up being games
[531.14 --> 536.14]  And my roommate and a bunch of other people wanted to play the new Call of Duty
[536.14 --> 541.14]  And you can't do that on Windows 8.1 which was my preferred operating system
[541.14 --> 544.14]  You can do it on Windows 7 which is interesting
[544.14 --> 548.14]  But yeah, you can do it on Windows 8.1 which was kind of a bummer
[548.14 --> 553.14]  I don't want to do the Apple forced to ditch the lightning connector thing
[553.14 --> 555.14]  Because Linus said he wanted to talk about that
[555.14 --> 561.14]  I don't think there's going to be a ton of conversation on this one so I'll dive into that
[561.14 --> 566.14]  The you don't have to go home but you can't stay here Windows 7 is dead thing
[566.14 --> 568.14]  You can still use Windows 7 to be clear
[568.14 --> 570.14]  It is just insecure
[570.14 --> 575.14]  Official support for Windows 7 has ended as of Tuesday January 14th 2020
[575.14 --> 578.14]  The hugely popular OS that's a little understated
[578.14 --> 584.14]  Will continue to get security updates for companies who pay $25 to $200 per workstation
[584.14 --> 589.14]  For the privilege but end users are SOL due to the end of life
[589.14 --> 591.14]  Waaaah! He's back!
[591.14 --> 594.14]  If you could pay $25 to $200
[594.14 --> 595.14]  How?
[595.14 --> 597.14]  As a user not as a workstation
[597.14 --> 599.14]  So like for your home PC
[599.14 --> 601.14]  And you were like a die hard
[601.14 --> 602.14]  Per year?
[602.14 --> 603.14]  Ooh, yes
[603.14 --> 604.14]  Software as a service?
[604.14 --> 605.14]  Yep, let's do it
[605.14 --> 606.14]  To keep using Windows 7
[606.14 --> 607.14]  Yeah
[607.14 --> 610.14]  Did they ever add DirectX 12?
[610.14 --> 617.14]  Uh, I don't know if they did universally I know definitely some games that are DX 12 work on Windows 7
[617.14 --> 619.14]  Right, but in like DirectX 11 mode
[619.14 --> 623.14]  I haven't done it because I haven't ran Windows 7 in a long time so I'm not sure
[623.14 --> 626.14]  What are you running now? You're on Windows 8 aren't you?
[626.14 --> 629.14]  I was 8.1 for a long time I've recently
[629.14 --> 630.14]  Poured over
[630.14 --> 633.14]  Oh no you didn't!
[633.14 --> 634.14]  Yeah, yeah
[634.14 --> 635.14]  Oh you finally did it
[635.14 --> 636.14]  I had installed
[636.14 --> 641.14]  Do you remember when my 8.1 like black screen bricked?
[641.14 --> 645.14]  And then I installed Mint and then I was like this is too tedious
[645.14 --> 646.14]  So I installed another operating system
[646.14 --> 648.14]  That other operating system was Windows 10
[648.14 --> 650.14]  Just because I was like it doesn't really matter
[650.14 --> 654.14]  All I really use is like Word, Excel and a web browser
[654.14 --> 655.14]  Yeah
[655.14 --> 656.14]  So, whatever
[656.14 --> 657.14]  So I just did it
[657.14 --> 659.14]  And then my laptop was also in Windows 10
[659.14 --> 662.14]  So I was like outnumbered with my own personal devices
[662.14 --> 665.14]  You know what? Personal use? I'm gonna say no
[665.14 --> 666.14]  I'm gonna say no
[666.14 --> 675.14]  Because the only justification for me to pay for an operating system is for it to have some kind of
[675.14 --> 679.14]  It has to enable me to do something that I otherwise couldn't do
[679.14 --> 684.14]  I mean for me the operating system is just something that mostly gets out of my way
[684.14 --> 685.14]  Yeah
[685.14 --> 688.14]  And there are things about Windows 10 that are super obnoxious
[688.14 --> 691.14]  It drives me nuts to this day that I have to
[691.14 --> 695.14]  What is it? An extra two clicks to get into my network connection settings
[695.14 --> 698.14]  Like just stupid, asinine things
[698.14 --> 701.14]  Like I want to know what the link speed of my Wi-Fi is
[701.14 --> 706.14]  I don't wanna right click then this then this then this then this other thing status
[706.14 --> 708.14]  Like it just takes too long to do something
[708.14 --> 710.14]  Audio settings annoying to get to
[710.14 --> 712.14]  Basically all of the settings are really annoying to get to
[712.14 --> 717.14]  Super frustrating and still not consolidated
[717.14 --> 719.14]  Like some of it's in the old style control panel
[719.14 --> 722.14]  Some of it's in the Metro UI style control panel
[722.14 --> 724.14]  Like finish your job at some point
[724.14 --> 726.14]  I have always hated this
[726.14 --> 730.14]  And like even I've been switched to Windows 10 for a little while now
[730.14 --> 731.14]  It's been like eight years
[731.14 --> 732.14]  Yeah
[732.14 --> 735.14]  But the this type of UI design
[735.14 --> 737.14]  I don't know if you want to show that or not
[737.14 --> 738.14]  Hold on
[738.14 --> 739.14]  Yeah sure
[739.14 --> 740.14]  That's probably fine
[740.14 --> 741.14]  I don't like this
[741.14 --> 742.14]  Yeah, well Metro
[742.14 --> 743.14]  I don't think it looks good
[743.14 --> 744.14]  I have never thought it looks good
[744.14 --> 745.14]  Yeah
[745.14 --> 746.14]  Aggressively boxy
[746.14 --> 750.14]  And the majority of the time they're just like only text
[750.14 --> 751.14]  Really flat
[751.14 --> 754.14]  Or text with a box out of lines around it
[754.14 --> 755.14]  Remember Aero Glass?
[755.14 --> 756.14]  Aero Glass was sweet
[756.14 --> 757.14]  Aero Glass was sweet
[757.14 --> 758.14]  Vista still looks so good
[758.14 --> 759.14]  It does
[759.14 --> 764.14]  So anyway for me the operating system when I'm at home
[764.14 --> 766.14]  Is just to get out of my way
[766.14 --> 767.14]  Yeah
[767.14 --> 769.14]  And I actually on a machine that's working
[769.14 --> 771.14]  One that I'm not tinkering with
[771.14 --> 775.14]  I access that stuff shockingly rarely
[775.14 --> 777.14]  Like on my the computer actually
[777.14 --> 778.14]  Wow
[778.14 --> 780.14]  The computer I actually use the most now
[780.14 --> 784.14]  Is the VR gaming rig connected to my TV in my living room
[784.14 --> 785.14]  Yeah, yeah
[785.14 --> 786.14]  Go figure
[786.14 --> 787.14]  I never would have seen that coming
[787.14 --> 789.14]  I use my laptop a fair bit
[789.14 --> 790.14]  But like only at work
[790.14 --> 792.14]  Oh no, okay I lied
[792.14 --> 794.14]  My workstation at work
[794.14 --> 795.14]  So I use the most
[795.14 --> 796.14]  I'm gonna tangent again
[796.14 --> 797.14]  Oh wow, okay
[797.14 --> 799.14]  I have to crush your heart a little bit
[799.14 --> 800.14]  What's this?
[800.14 --> 801.14]  What's this?
[801.14 --> 806.14]  Jaden just decided to randomly get the song you were playing on
[806.14 --> 807.14]  What a monster
[807.14 --> 809.14]  On Beat Saber
[809.14 --> 811.14]  After you played it
[811.14 --> 813.14]  And I don't know why it's not loading right now
[813.14 --> 816.14]  But yeah, he 100%ed it on Expert
[816.14 --> 817.14]  Full combo, no misses
[817.14 --> 820.14]  It was a good live stream though
[820.14 --> 824.14]  Expert plus 100%
[824.14 --> 827.14]  Anyway, I will address that later
[827.14 --> 829.14]  Oh there it is, there it goes
[829.14 --> 830.14]  Oh whatever
[830.14 --> 831.14]  Anyway, so
[831.14 --> 833.14]  Yeah, I'd so
[833.14 --> 834.14]  Okay
[834.14 --> 837.14]  That is so off topic
[837.14 --> 839.14]  Wancho I guess
[839.14 --> 840.14]  So
[840.14 --> 844.14]  Where my position changes on this
[844.14 --> 846.14]  Oh no, you said your VR PC, that's why
[846.14 --> 848.14]  Yeah, so my VR PC is the one that I probably use the most
[848.14 --> 849.14]  Yeah
[849.14 --> 850.14]  Yeah
[850.14 --> 852.14]  Aside from maybe my workstation
[852.14 --> 853.14]  Which I use for work
[853.14 --> 854.14]  Yeah
[854.14 --> 855.14]  Um
[855.14 --> 858.14]  And I almost never dink around with anything
[858.14 --> 860.14]  Like once I've got everything configured
[860.14 --> 861.14]  Once it's, yeah
[861.14 --> 862.14]  Yeah
[862.14 --> 863.14]  Yeah, when you first set it up
[863.14 --> 867.14]  Yeah, once I've got Steam VR set up to, you know, properly switch which audio devices
[867.14 --> 869.14]  When I open and close VR
[869.14 --> 873.14]  Um, now that I don't actually try to use my PC to watch movies
[873.14 --> 875.14]  Now that I just use Plex through the Nvidia Shield
[875.14 --> 878.14]  Uh, all my Harmony stuff is like perfect
[878.14 --> 879.14]  It goes to sleep
[879.14 --> 880.14]  It wakes up properly
[880.14 --> 884.14]  Uh, with that, that ancient Microsoft IR receiver
[884.14 --> 887.14]  From like way back like 2002, 2003
[887.14 --> 888.14]  Still using that thing
[888.14 --> 889.14]  It's freaking awesome
[889.14 --> 890.14]  Still has driver support
[890.14 --> 891.14]  Um
[891.14 --> 894.14]  So I just don't really touch that stuff
[894.14 --> 896.14]  So all I really do with Windows
[896.14 --> 898.14]  Is
[898.14 --> 901.14]  Go down to the task manager to like open a thing
[901.14 --> 902.14]  Yeah
[902.14 --> 904.14]  And that's it
[904.14 --> 906.14]  Like that's the only purpose it serves for me
[906.14 --> 907.14]  So at home
[907.14 --> 910.14]  The only thing I could really possibly care about
[910.14 --> 911.14]  Is
[911.14 --> 913.14]  That it like supports the stuff I want to do
[913.14 --> 915.14]  And
[915.14 --> 916.14]  Yeah
[916.14 --> 917.14]  I use pretty new stuff
[917.14 --> 918.14]  So I guess that's fine
[918.14 --> 921.14]  And even if I used older stuff
[921.14 --> 923.14]  If it was for personal use
[923.14 --> 924.14]  Most of the personal use type things
[924.14 --> 926.14]  Like a, a webcam or a printer
[926.14 --> 929.14]  Cost so little compared to paying a maintenance fee
[929.14 --> 930.14]  For your operating system
[930.14 --> 931.14]  Yeah
[931.14 --> 933.14]  That you are probably better off replacing that
[934.14 --> 935.14]  With that said
[935.14 --> 937.14]  If I was a business
[937.14 --> 939.14]  Particularly a small business
[939.14 --> 941.14]  Like I, I had a neighbor before that ran
[941.14 --> 942.14]  Um
[942.14 --> 943.14]  Um
[943.14 --> 945.14]  A sign making business out of his garage
[945.14 --> 948.14]  And he had like CNC software
[948.14 --> 949.14]  And
[949.14 --> 950.14]  It has to be
[950.14 --> 951.14]  Yeah
[951.14 --> 952.14]  Electronics design software
[952.14 --> 955.14]  That only ran on Windows XP
[955.14 --> 956.14]  Okay
[956.14 --> 958.14]  And so for him the cost of upgrading
[958.14 --> 961.14]  Compared to the cost of maintaining a software
[961.14 --> 963.14]  Uh, maintaining an operating system
[963.14 --> 965.14]  Could actually be
[965.14 --> 966.14]  Far more
[966.14 --> 969.14]  Like that could convince him to spend $25 a year on
[969.14 --> 971.14]  So my, my one argument there would be
[971.14 --> 972.14]  Well in his case Windows XP
[972.14 --> 973.14]  But like
[973.14 --> 975.14]  Does he even need that connected to the internet?
[975.14 --> 976.14]  Uh, no
[976.14 --> 978.14]  Yeah, so then
[978.14 --> 980.14]  Then he can just run XP
[980.14 --> 981.14]  And
[981.14 --> 982.14]  Right, but okay
[982.14 --> 983.14]  In, let's say in a case
[983.14 --> 984.14]  Where it was
[984.14 --> 986.14]  Like a, a production system
[986.14 --> 987.14]  Yeah
[987.14 --> 988.14]  Yeah
[988.14 --> 989.14]  Yeah
[989.14 --> 990.14]  And there are those
[990.14 --> 991.14]  Yeah
[991.14 --> 992.14]  Airport terminals are really common for it
[992.14 --> 993.14]  Yeah
[993.14 --> 994.14]  Yeah
[994.14 --> 995.14]  That's a really great example
[995.14 --> 996.14]  Or even just an office
[996.14 --> 998.14]  That's just full of people who just
[998.14 --> 999.14]  Type documents all day
[999.14 --> 1001.14]  And absolutely do not need new computers
[1001.14 --> 1003.14]  Like the cost of outfitting an entire office
[1003.14 --> 1004.14]  With new computers
[1004.14 --> 1008.14]  Compared to the cost of spending $25 a year per seat
[1008.14 --> 1010.14]  For five years
[1010.14 --> 1011.14]  Yeah
[1011.14 --> 1012.14]  Like
[1012.14 --> 1015.14]  And then just replace it when it's dead style
[1015.14 --> 1016.14]  Exactly
[1016.14 --> 1017.14]  Approach
[1017.14 --> 1018.14]  Yeah
[1018.14 --> 1019.14]  Exactly
[1019.14 --> 1020.14]  Um, I mean there are
[1020.14 --> 1021.14]  I would gladly pay a fee
[1021.14 --> 1023.14]  To be able to keep using Windows 8.1
[1023.14 --> 1024.14]  Really?
[1024.14 --> 1025.14]  Like
[1025.14 --> 1027.14]  But you switched to Windows 10 voluntarily now
[1027.14 --> 1028.14]  You have to justify that
[1028.14 --> 1029.14]  You have to explain it
[1029.14 --> 1031.14]  You brought up the compatibility issue
[1031.14 --> 1032.14]  Oh, okay
[1032.14 --> 1033.14]  My friends wanted to play a game
[1033.14 --> 1034.14]  I couldn't play the game with them
[1034.14 --> 1035.14]  Oh
[1035.14 --> 1037.14]  Like, hey, well this is pretty lame
[1037.14 --> 1038.14]  Cause like at this point
[1038.14 --> 1041.14]  I play most games for like social reasons
[1041.14 --> 1043.14]  Right, so I looked it up
[1043.14 --> 1044.14]  And uh, yes
[1044.14 --> 1046.14]  Microsoft did port DirectX 12 to Windows 7
[1046.14 --> 1048.14]  But only for certain games
[1048.14 --> 1049.14]  Yeah, okay
[1049.14 --> 1051.14]  Yeah, so you were right about that
[1051.14 --> 1052.14]  I was pretty unsure, but yeah
[1052.14 --> 1053.14]  So like
[1053.14 --> 1054.14]  How much would you pay?
[1054.14 --> 1056.14]  I would definitely pay within that range
[1056.14 --> 1057.14]  Really?
[1057.14 --> 1058.14]  Yeah
[1058.14 --> 1059.14]  Okay
[1059.14 --> 1060.14]  Because I think
[1060.14 --> 1065.14]  Windows 10 definitely gives me more grief than that cost is worth
[1065.14 --> 1066.14]  If that makes sense
[1066.14 --> 1068.14]  What has it done to you lately?
[1068.14 --> 1069.14]  Um
[1069.14 --> 1070.14]  Is it that bad?
[1070.14 --> 1073.14]  For some, everything worked perfectly before I moved to Windows 10
[1073.14 --> 1075.14]  And I have done three reformats since this
[1075.14 --> 1077.14]  Trying to figure out what the problem is
[1077.14 --> 1079.14]  And installing not all programs every time
[1079.14 --> 1080.14]  Trying to narrow it down
[1080.14 --> 1082.14]  But it hitches like crazy
[1082.14 --> 1083.14]  Really?
[1083.14 --> 1086.14]  And will randomly like freeze
[1086.14 --> 1088.14]  All screens will completely freeze
[1088.14 --> 1091.14]  And then any game that is in full screen windowed mode
[1091.14 --> 1092.14]  Yeah
[1092.14 --> 1093.14]  Will
[1093.14 --> 1094.14]  And become a window
[1094.14 --> 1096.14]  And I have no idea why
[1096.14 --> 1097.14]  No idea why
[1097.14 --> 1099.14]  I've tried various NVIDIA drivers
[1099.14 --> 1102.14]  I've tried like everything
[1102.14 --> 1103.14]  And it just
[1103.14 --> 1106.14]  I think Windows 10 just hates me personally
[1106.14 --> 1107.14]  At this point
[1107.14 --> 1109.14]  That does seem to be the only rational conclusion
[1109.14 --> 1110.14]  I don't know
[1110.14 --> 1112.14]  Everything was perfect in Windows 8.1
[1112.14 --> 1115.14]  And then now I just have a variety of issues
[1115.14 --> 1118.14]  I find like one thing that I do fairly often
[1118.14 --> 1123.14]  Is will watch like a show through my computer
[1123.14 --> 1124.14]  Yeah
[1124.14 --> 1125.14]  Because I don't have a TV yet
[1125.14 --> 1126.14]  Yeah
[1126.14 --> 1129.14]  And I'll switch the audio source to my speakers
[1129.14 --> 1132.14]  And that's just annoying every single time
[1132.14 --> 1134.14]  Because going into the settings
[1134.14 --> 1135.14]  And doing all this kind of stuff
[1135.14 --> 1136.14]  Get Sound Switch
[1136.14 --> 1137.14]  It's way simpler
[1137.14 --> 1138.14]  Is that an external program?
[1138.14 --> 1139.14]  Sound Switch
[1139.14 --> 1141.14]  Yeah, it's a super, super lightweight
[1141.14 --> 1142.14]  You can just set a hotkey
[1142.14 --> 1143.14]  Oh, okay, that's cool
[1143.14 --> 1144.14]  Yeah
[1144.14 --> 1147.14]  So that's what I was using back when
[1147.14 --> 1150.14]  When I was using wireless headphones on the TV sometimes
[1150.14 --> 1153.14]  Well, I don't know if I ever actually ended up using them
[1153.14 --> 1155.14]  But I set up wireless headphones on the TV
[1155.14 --> 1159.14]  And then realized that nobody in the entire building I live in
[1159.14 --> 1162.14]  Ever sits and watches TV alone
[1162.14 --> 1164.14]  Yeah
[1164.14 --> 1166.14]  When people are consuming content alone
[1166.14 --> 1168.14]  It's generally on a tablet or a phone
[1168.14 --> 1169.14]  Okay
[1169.14 --> 1170.14]  And when they're consuming it together
[1170.14 --> 1171.14]  They don't wear headphones
[1171.14 --> 1172.14]  Yeah
[1172.14 --> 1175.14]  So those headphones have just been sitting there for like
[1175.14 --> 1177.14]  You know, two years or three years or whatever
[1177.14 --> 1178.14]  Right
[1178.14 --> 1179.14]  But when I set it up
[1179.14 --> 1180.14]  I got Sound Switch
[1180.14 --> 1184.14]  Oh, and back when the audio switching for VR was a flakier
[1184.14 --> 1187.14]  Like in the very, very early launch days of the HTC Vive
[1187.14 --> 1191.14]  I would use Sound Switch to like fix it if it glitched out
[1191.14 --> 1194.14]  Just like, hey, switch over to the other thing
[1194.14 --> 1200.14]  There's other stuff that's just kind of annoying on probably a more like principle kind of level
[1200.14 --> 1201.14]  Yeah
[1201.14 --> 1204.14]  Like the start menu just being so stupid
[1204.14 --> 1206.14]  Yeah, the search is so bad
[1206.14 --> 1208.14]  And Windows 8.1 search was great
[1208.14 --> 1211.14]  My favorite one now is when I search for Teams
[1211.14 --> 1212.14]  T-E-A-M-S
[1212.14 --> 1216.14]  My first result is always TeamViewer
[1216.14 --> 1218.14]  And my second result is always
[1218.14 --> 1219.14]  Teams
[1219.14 --> 1221.14]  Microsoft Teams
[1221.14 --> 1227.14]  And it's like, it's your own software
[1227.14 --> 1229.14]  And your own search
[1230.14 --> 1231.14]  Can't prioritize it
[1231.14 --> 1232.14]  I will
[1232.14 --> 1233.14]  And I put the S in
[1233.14 --> 1234.14]  Yeah
[1234.14 --> 1235.14]  I'm not searching T-E-A-M
[1235.14 --> 1237.14]  Which if you did, TeamViewer coming up first
[1237.14 --> 1238.14]  Sure
[1238.14 --> 1239.14]  Makes perfect sense
[1239.14 --> 1240.14]  Cause I use it all the time
[1240.14 --> 1241.14]  Yep
[1241.14 --> 1243.14]  T-E-A-M-S
[1243.14 --> 1246.14]  And it comes up with TeamViewer
[1246.14 --> 1248.14]  I can't actually show it here
[1248.14 --> 1250.14]  I don't think this has Teams on it
[1250.14 --> 1252.14]  Or TeamViewer apparently
[1252.14 --> 1253.14]  And then it searches it
[1253.14 --> 1254.14]  And like
[1254.14 --> 1255.14]  Ugh
[1255.14 --> 1257.14]  Even if you have a tough time finding it
[1257.14 --> 1258.14]  Yeah
[1258.14 --> 1259.14]  I never want you to search it
[1259.14 --> 1262.14]  I am never going to search something online with the start menu
[1262.14 --> 1264.14]  That will never ever happen
[1264.14 --> 1267.14]  Right, but you're an advanced user
[1267.14 --> 1268.14]  I don't care
[1268.14 --> 1269.14]  I think
[1269.14 --> 1270.14]  Give me the option to control this
[1270.14 --> 1272.14]  Let me turn search a web page
[1272.14 --> 1273.14]  I don't
[1273.14 --> 1274.14]  I don't
[1274.14 --> 1275.14]  Maybe
[1275.14 --> 1276.14]  I just haven't found it
[1276.14 --> 1277.14]  I mean the thing about Windows
[1277.14 --> 1279.14]  The settings menu suck so I'm not sure
[1279.14 --> 1280.14]  The thing about Windows is
[1280.14 --> 1283.14]  If you're willing to go in and play around with RegEdit
[1283.14 --> 1285.14]  It's actually very customizable
[1285.14 --> 1287.14]  So you use Linux
[1287.14 --> 1289.14]  It's actually very customizable
[1289.14 --> 1290.14]  No, not necessarily
[1290.14 --> 1291.14]  That's not always the solution
[1291.14 --> 1292.14]  You're going pretty far
[1292.14 --> 1293.14]  Okay, you're talking about
[1293.14 --> 1295.14]  You want to play a game with your friends
[1295.14 --> 1297.14]  Linux ain't necessarily the solution there
[1297.14 --> 1299.14]  That is definitely a little bit more work
[1299.14 --> 1301.14]  Yes, that is a fair bit more work
[1301.14 --> 1302.14]  But I also
[1302.14 --> 1303.14]  The first thing
[1303.14 --> 1304.14]  The first thing
[1304.14 --> 1305.14]  The first thing that I did
[1305.14 --> 1307.14]  An animation speed or whatever
[1307.14 --> 1308.14]  Like
[1308.14 --> 1309.14]  The first thing that I did
[1309.14 --> 1310.14]  That required a reformat
[1310.14 --> 1314.14]  Was I followed the Linus Tech Tips Windows 9 guide
[1314.14 --> 1318.14]  Which like destroyed everything
[1318.14 --> 1319.14]  And was horrible
[1319.14 --> 1322.14]  You guys need to add like a thing on the forum that says don't do this
[1322.14 --> 1323.14]  Oh is it bad now?
[1323.14 --> 1324.14]  Yes, very
[1324.14 --> 1325.14]  Because it was great when we first did it
[1325.14 --> 1326.14]  I'm sure
[1326.14 --> 1327.14]  Oh
[1327.14 --> 1331.14]  Like honestly our export server is still running that
[1331.14 --> 1333.14]  I don't know
[1333.14 --> 1335.14]  Maybe it works better with updates later on
[1335.14 --> 1337.14]  Maybe Windows just hates you in general
[1337.14 --> 1338.14]  Maybe that
[1338.14 --> 1339.14]  Maybe that
[1339.14 --> 1340.14]  Because we've never gotten another complaint about that
[1340.14 --> 1341.14]  One of the software projects
[1341.14 --> 1342.14]  One of the software
[1342.14 --> 1344.14]  I don't remember what it was
[1344.14 --> 1345.14]  You had to get it from GitHub
[1345.14 --> 1346.14]  Yeah
[1346.14 --> 1347.14]  Yeah
[1347.14 --> 1348.14]  It's just super out of date
[1348.14 --> 1349.14]  Oh
[1349.14 --> 1350.14]  Deprecated
[1350.14 --> 1351.14]  And like there's a few things like that
[1351.14 --> 1352.14]  Right
[1352.14 --> 1354.14]  Where applying them now might not really work as well
[1354.14 --> 1355.14]  Right
[1355.14 --> 1356.14]  But if you had them and you were updating with it
[1356.14 --> 1358.14]  Maybe Windows handles it better
[1358.14 --> 1359.14]  Got it
[1359.14 --> 1360.14]  I'm not sure
[1360.14 --> 1361.14]  Or Windows just hates me
[1361.14 --> 1363.14]  I'm happy with either of those explanations at this point
[1363.14 --> 1364.14]  It's also possible
[1364.14 --> 1365.14]  Yeah
[1365.14 --> 1367.14]  Windows 8.1 loves me though
[1367.14 --> 1369.14]  And I abandoned it
[1369.14 --> 1371.14]  So basically
[1371.14 --> 1373.14]  How far did you get into this?
[1373.14 --> 1376.14]  So unless you're willing to pay a bunch of money
[1376.14 --> 1377.14]  Which I think
[1377.14 --> 1380.14]  I think we can probably both agree that unless it's for business reasons
[1380.14 --> 1382.14]  You probably can't really justify it
[1382.14 --> 1383.14]  Yeah
[1383.14 --> 1389.14]  So unless you're willing to pay you are SOL or so we thought
[1389.14 --> 1395.14]  So a bypass has been found that enables extended support updates for end users by bypassing the ESU key check
[1395.14 --> 1397.14]  Unknown how long this will work for
[1397.14 --> 1399.14]  Unknown how long this will work for
[1399.14 --> 1401.14]  I mean Microsoft has demonstrated in the past
[1401.14 --> 1407.14]  That they're willing to turn a blind eye to end users working around their checkpoints
[1407.14 --> 1409.14]  But not necessarily on everything
[1409.14 --> 1412.14]  So one of the most famous examples of them
[1412.14 --> 1417.14]  Just sort of pretending not to notice something
[1417.14 --> 1421.14]  Is the free upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8 to Windows 10
[1421.14 --> 1424.14]  They said hey we're going to end it at this time
[1424.14 --> 1428.14]  Then they extended it formally if I recall correctly by some period
[1428.14 --> 1431.14]  Then they either extended it again or they just ignored it
[1431.14 --> 1432.14]  Yeah
[1432.14 --> 1435.14]  And then they just never ever ever turned it off
[1435.14 --> 1438.14]  So to this day you can install Windows 7
[1438.14 --> 1441.14]  Free upgrade it to Windows 10
[1441.14 --> 1443.14]  Or you can just install Windows 10
[1443.14 --> 1445.14]  Use a Windows 7 product key
[1445.14 --> 1447.14]  Just like enter it add install it'll just work
[1447.14 --> 1448.14]  It treats it all completely
[1448.14 --> 1449.14]  Yeah
[1449.14 --> 1450.14]  I didn't know that
[1450.14 --> 1451.14]  Yeah I did it the other day
[1451.14 --> 1452.14]  Wow
[1452.14 --> 1453.14]  Even once your Windows 10 is already installed
[1453.14 --> 1455.14]  You can like go to activate
[1455.14 --> 1456.14]  And I was able
[1456.14 --> 1459.14]  So I changed the hardware in my in my VR gaming machine
[1459.14 --> 1464.14]  And I needed to reactivate Windows because it got mad
[1464.14 --> 1465.14]  Okay
[1465.14 --> 1468.14]  So the problem is that I hadn't actually dealt with that in a long time
[1468.14 --> 1471.14]  Because I hadn't upgraded my personal rig in like
[1471.14 --> 1473.14]  Three or four years or something like that
[1473.14 --> 1475.14]  It had been quite a while and they've made a lot of changes
[1475.14 --> 1480.14]  So it is still possible to retain your license from one hardware set to another
[1480.14 --> 1481.14]  As far as I can tell
[1481.14 --> 1482.14]  Although I didn't successfully do it
[1482.14 --> 1484.14]  Because it looks like you have to deregister it first
[1484.14 --> 1487.14]  I will say one thing that was kind of nice
[1487.14 --> 1488.14]  Yeah
[1488.14 --> 1492.14]  Is I did the instead of doing the I want to use an offline account thing
[1492.14 --> 1494.14]  I used my actual Microsoft account every time
[1494.14 --> 1495.14]  Yeah
[1495.14 --> 1499.14]  And I would in this whole move like I'm moving to Windows 10 or whatever
[1499.14 --> 1501.14]  I'm going to be super legit
[1501.14 --> 1504.14]  I'm going to buy a key properly through my Microsoft account
[1504.14 --> 1505.14]  All that kind of stuff
[1505.14 --> 1508.14]  And I kept the keys in my email somewhere
[1508.14 --> 1510.14]  So I kept on just being like I don't have a key
[1510.14 --> 1512.14]  But then when I signed in it would just grab it
[1512.14 --> 1513.14]  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1513.14 --> 1514.14]  And that was a nice
[1514.14 --> 1515.14]  Yeah so it's tied to the hardware
[1515.14 --> 1516.14]  That was a nice experience
[1516.14 --> 1518.14]  But that means that you have to deregister it
[1518.14 --> 1520.14]  Yeah but I didn't have to is what I'm saying
[1520.14 --> 1522.14]  But you didn't change the hardware
[1522.14 --> 1524.14]  That's oh oh okay to move it from hardware to hardware
[1524.14 --> 1525.14]  Right
[1525.14 --> 1526.14]  Okay okay okay
[1526.14 --> 1527.14]  So the only way for me to do that
[1527.14 --> 1530.14]  Would have been to rebuild up the whole computer
[1530.14 --> 1531.14]  Yeah
[1531.14 --> 1532.14]  Deregister it
[1532.14 --> 1534.14]  And I was just it's a small form factor machine
[1534.14 --> 1535.14]  I was just like no I can't do this
[1535.14 --> 1537.14]  So out of desperation
[1537.14 --> 1540.14]  I had an old Windows 7 ultimate key
[1540.14 --> 1542.14]  And I was like what happens if I
[1542.14 --> 1544.14]  Activated
[1544.14 --> 1546.14]  No problem Windows 10 Pro
[1546.14 --> 1547.14]  So what
[1547.14 --> 1548.14]  Bippity boppity there you go
[1548.14 --> 1549.14]  Yep Windows 10 Pro
[1549.14 --> 1550.14]  Well I had Windows 10 Pro installed
[1550.14 --> 1553.14]  So I knew I was going to need something other than Windows 7 home
[1553.14 --> 1555.14]  I'm pretty sure that transition doesn't work
[1555.14 --> 1562.14]  So yeah so the work around that you know everyone I think knows about then
[1562.14 --> 1567.14]  Is because Windows 7 is that because Windows 7 was so easy to pirate
[1567.14 --> 1571.14]  If you pirate Windows 7 and then upgrade to Windows 10
[1571.14 --> 1576.14]  You end up with a legit Windows 10 install
[1576.14 --> 1583.14]  And so Microsoft has had every opportunity under the sun to block that off over the last few years
[1583.14 --> 1586.14]  But they just for whatever reason didn't do it
[1586.14 --> 1588.14]  And we made a video about this recently on Techquickie
[1588.14 --> 1592.14]  It was the it was like the most explosive Techquickie we've ever made
[1592.14 --> 1594.14]  People loved it people hated it
[1594.14 --> 1596.14]  It got 2.2 million views in the first few days
[1596.14 --> 1597.14]  What was it?
[1597.14 --> 1599.14]  Which is crazy for Techquickie
[1599.14 --> 1602.14]  The title was why is Windows 10 free now
[1602.14 --> 1609.14]  And basically some people got really mad because they were like well it's not free that's piracy
[1609.14 --> 1610.14]  How many views does it have now?
[1610.14 --> 1611.14]  2.3 I think
[1611.14 --> 1614.14]  2.375 that's nuts for Techquickie
[1614.14 --> 1615.14]  Yeah
[1615.14 --> 1619.14]  And so people were mad because they were like this is promoting software piracy
[1619.14 --> 1625.14]  And actually if you watch the video we never say that it's the right thing to do
[1625.14 --> 1631.14]  We just say that Microsoft has had every opportunity to close this off
[1631.14 --> 1633.14]  And they haven't done it
[1633.14 --> 1635.14]  And then we speculate as to why that might be
[1635.14 --> 1641.14]  Including some backup from statements that Microsoft and their leadership have made publicly
[1641.14 --> 1644.14]  About how Windows 10 is going to be the last Windows
[1644.14 --> 1646.14]  And it's more about the install base
[1646.14 --> 1648.14]  And it's more about building out the ecosystem
[1648.14 --> 1653.14]  And it's less about trying to milk people for $126
[1653.14 --> 1654.14]  Yeah
[1654.14 --> 1658.14]  Or whatever you know an OEM Windows license cost every 2-3 years
[1658.14 --> 1662.14]  They're just they've accepted that they're moving away from that model
[1662.14 --> 1665.14]  And they're moving towards this more cloud focused one
[1665.14 --> 1668.14]  And honestly you know you look at their profits
[1668.14 --> 1672.14]  It seems to be going just right in spite of them not selling as many Windows licenses
[1672.14 --> 1674.14]  And new machine licensing fees aren't going anywhere
[1674.14 --> 1677.14]  Yeah I was going to say I've been convinced for a long time
[1677.14 --> 1683.14]  That it's not about selling to users that are like building their own computers and stuff
[1683.14 --> 1685.14]  I think they've essentially never cared
[1685.14 --> 1687.14]  We're such a minority of a minority
[1687.14 --> 1688.14]  But exactly
[1688.14 --> 1691.14]  And if they can just like shut us up
[1691.14 --> 1694.14]  By being like just take your stupid free operating system
[1694.14 --> 1696.14]  That's almost certainly going to be better for them in the long run
[1696.14 --> 1698.14]  As long as they're making money somewhere else
[1698.14 --> 1699.14]  Yeah
[1699.14 --> 1700.14]  But yes
[1700.14 --> 1701.14]  And they've shifted so they are
[1701.14 --> 1705.14]  Selling OEM licenses and doing all these other things makes way more sense
[1705.14 --> 1708.14]  Like oh yeah you're all used to using Windows because it's free
[1708.14 --> 1709.14]  Ha ha ha ha
[1709.14 --> 1711.14]  And then now you have to pay for it when you buy a laptop
[1711.14 --> 1714.14]  I mean how else were they going to maintain their dominance
[1714.14 --> 1715.14]  Yeah
[1715.14 --> 1720.14]  Because I don't think that in a world where Apple doesn't charge for operating system updates
[1720.14 --> 1723.14]  In a world where Linux is continuing to get better and better and better
[1723.14 --> 1728.14]  They were going to be able to keep charging you $100 and $150 every couple of years forever
[1728.14 --> 1729.14]  That wasn't going to happen
[1729.14 --> 1734.14]  Some guy's having an aneurysm because he's telling me to change the audio output through the volume icon on the taskbar
[1734.14 --> 1735.14]  I know
[1735.14 --> 1738.14]  But it's like too many steps that's my whole point
[1738.14 --> 1739.14]  Yep
[1739.14 --> 1740.14]  It was just easier on 8.1
[1740.14 --> 1741.14]  Yep
[1741.14 --> 1746.14]  Oh yeah it's just like more stupid things
[1746.14 --> 1747.14]  Yep
[1747.14 --> 1748.14]  Yeah
[1748.14 --> 1750.14]  Alright so what else do we have to talk about
[1750.14 --> 1752.14]  For those who have hardware no longer supported
[1752.14 --> 1753.14]  Try out Linux
[1753.14 --> 1754.14]  Hey there you go
[1754.14 --> 1758.14]  But don't stick with Windows 7 if you can at all help it
[1758.14 --> 1760.14]  That is really important
[1760.14 --> 1762.14]  Security is a big deal
[1762.14 --> 1764.14]  And you ain't going to have it
[1764.14 --> 1769.14]  That NSA flaw is a perfect example of how even though it's older software at this point
[1769.14 --> 1773.14]  There are still absolutely exploits and bugs that are being found
[1773.14 --> 1776.14]  So whatever it is that you are updating to
[1776.14 --> 1779.14]  We did a video about this on LTT a little while ago
[1779.14 --> 1781.14]  It should be something
[1781.14 --> 1785.14]  So for now there's the ESU key bypass
[1785.14 --> 1787.14]  Check bypass
[1787.14 --> 1790.14]  No idea how long that'll work
[1790.14 --> 1793.14]  For the future though you're going to have to do something
[1793.14 --> 1796.14]  I mean 8.1 I think has another couple years left on it
[1797.14 --> 1799.14]  Not much though actually now that I think about it
[1799.14 --> 1801.14]  When's 8.1 end of support?
[1803.14 --> 1804.14]  It's I mean
[1805.14 --> 1807.14]  It's already kind of lost a lot of different forms of support
[1807.14 --> 1808.14]  Just not security
[1809.14 --> 1810.14]  January 10, 2023
[1810.14 --> 1812.14]  But it like it didn't get DX12
[1812.14 --> 1813.14]  It's not getting other stuff
[1813.14 --> 1815.14]  It's a it's the user base is so small
[1816.14 --> 1817.14]  Like I don't know
[1817.14 --> 1821.14]  Oh no end of mainstream support January 9, 2018
[1821.14 --> 1823.14]  End of extended support January 10, 2023
[1823.14 --> 1824.14]  Yeah it's basically
[1824.14 --> 1825.14]  Yeah
[1825.14 --> 1826.14]  Basically completely abandoned at this point
[1826.14 --> 1827.14]  They're ending that
[1827.14 --> 1828.14]  Yep
[1828.14 --> 1830.14]  So Windows 10 is the only Windows
[1830.14 --> 1831.14]  It's all there is to it
[1831.14 --> 1833.14]  You can like it or you can
[1833.14 --> 1837.14]  Put a lot of work into using something else
[1838.14 --> 1840.14]  Speaking of putting a lot of work in
[1840.14 --> 1843.14]  I did not put a lot of work into this sponsorship segway
[1843.14 --> 1846.14]  FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool
[1846.14 --> 1848.14]  For small business owners and freelancers
[1848.14 --> 1851.14]  It does more than just help you create slick looking invoices
[1851.14 --> 1853.14]  You can track your time with their timesheet function
[1853.14 --> 1854.14]  You can manage your expenses
[1854.14 --> 1856.14]  Keep track of who owes you what
[1856.14 --> 1860.14]  You can take all of the functionality with you on the go
[1860.14 --> 1863.14]  With their mobile apps for iOS and Android
[1863.14 --> 1867.14]  And you can call their support staff and talk to a real person
[1867.14 --> 1869.14]  If you have any trouble
[1869.14 --> 1871.14]  That's one of the coolest things about FreshBooks

[1879.14 --> 1883.14]  Oh this is interesting
[1883.14 --> 1885.14]  Humble Bundle is a sponsor today
[1885.14 --> 1887.14]  Save money, contribute to charity
[1887.14 --> 1889.14]  And get great deals on games
[1889.14 --> 1891.14]  At lmg.gg slash humblebundle
[1891.14 --> 1894.14]  Um, yeah that's pretty much all there is to it
[1894.14 --> 1897.14]  Humble Bundle believes that you should pay for what you want
[1897.14 --> 1899.14]  And they even give you the ability to select
[1899.14 --> 1901.14]  How much you want to give to each party
[1901.14 --> 1904.14]  The creator, the charity, and even to Humble Bundle themselves
[1904.14 --> 1907.14]  You can either shop on specific titles through their store page
[1907.14 --> 1908.14]  Or through their bundle sets
[1908.14 --> 1909.14]  Pick the bundle you want
[1909.14 --> 1912.14]  Or subscribe to their monthly bundle to save even more
[1912.14 --> 1914.14]  So check them out at lmg.gg slash humblebundle
[1914.14 --> 1916.14]  Apparently this is a partner link
[1916.14 --> 1918.14]  Rather than a specific sponsorship
[1918.14 --> 1920.14]  So there you go, now we know
[1920.14 --> 1922.14]  And finally, Displate
[1922.14 --> 1924.14]  Use offer code LTT to save 15%
[1924.14 --> 1926.14]  At lmg.gg slash displate when
[1926.14 --> 1930.14]  Displates are magnetically mounted metal prints
[1930.14 --> 1932.14]  This demo is great
[1932.14 --> 1933.14]  You do the same demo every time
[1933.14 --> 1934.14]  No I'm doing it differently
[1934.14 --> 1935.14]  I'm doing it differently
[1935.14 --> 1936.14]  You're doing it differently?
[1936.14 --> 1937.14]  Alright, alright
[1937.14 --> 1938.14]  I don't usually bring them up here
[1938.14 --> 1940.14]  I realized when they sit back there they're out of focus
[1940.14 --> 1942.14]  They got a quarter million different artworks
[1942.14 --> 1944.14]  Spanning a bunch of different styles and influences
[1944.14 --> 1946.14]  You don't need any power tools to hang it
[1946.14 --> 1950.14]  Because it's just like a sticker you put on the wall with a magnet on it
[1950.14 --> 1952.14]  Look at that!
[1952.14 --> 1954.14]  Pretty freaking awesome!
[1954.14 --> 1955.14]  Trying to not get glare on it
[1955.14 --> 1957.14]  They plant a tree for every display purchased
[1957.14 --> 1960.14]  And they've partnered with CD Projekt Red to create
[1960.14 --> 1961.14]  Cyberpunk 2077 prints
[1961.14 --> 1966.14]  You can even get some pretty special edition Linus Media Group prints as well
[1966.14 --> 1968.14]  Also, oh yeah so
[1968.14 --> 1971.14]  Please belay 2, the Cyberpunk 2077 prints
[1971.14 --> 1973.14]  Hey! Got em!
[1973.14 --> 1974.14]  That's pretty funny
[1974.14 --> 1975.14]  Got em!

[2002.14 --> 2004.14]  And the hats, TechLink hats, LTT hats
[2004.14 --> 2005.14]  Nice!
[2005.14 --> 2006.14]  That's a good promo
[2006.14 --> 2007.14]  Heck yeah
[2007.14 --> 2009.14]  Do we have a lot of hats we're trying to move through?
[2009.14 --> 2010.14]  Heck yeah
[2010.14 --> 2011.14]  Heck yeah
[2011.14 --> 2012.14]  Alright cool
[2012.14 --> 2013.14]  We got lots of hats
[2013.14 --> 2017.14]  Yeah minimum order quantities on hats are pretty high in case anyone was wondering
[2017.14 --> 2018.14]  Yeah
[2018.14 --> 2019.14]  Heck yeah
[2019.14 --> 2020.14]  Alright let's do it
[2020.14 --> 2023.14]  Did you like my twitter post from an hour ago?
[2023.14 --> 2025.14]  I actually did not see your twitter post from an hour ago
[2025.14 --> 2026.14]  Why?
[2026.14 --> 2027.14]  I thought it was pretty good
[2027.14 --> 2029.14]  What are you posting on the twitter now?
[2029.14 --> 2031.14]  The LTT twitter has been so meme-y
[2031.14 --> 2032.14]  It's mostly this guy
[2032.14 --> 2034.14]  So meme-y
[2034.14 --> 2036.14]  Do you want your tech tip?
[2036.14 --> 2037.14]  I have tech tip for you
[2037.14 --> 2043.14]  In your opinion if we did a blind key switch challenge which switch must be included?
[2043.14 --> 2045.14]  It's free real estate
[2045.14 --> 2046.14]  Oh thank you very much for that
[2046.14 --> 2047.14]  LTTstore.com
[2047.14 --> 2048.14]  Yeah alright
[2048.14 --> 2049.14]  Alright alright
[2049.14 --> 2050.14]  Alright alright
[2050.14 --> 2051.14]  Have a good weekend get out of here
[2051.14 --> 2052.14]  See ya
[2052.14 --> 2053.14]  Later
[2053.14 --> 2054.14]  Honestly like
[2054.14 --> 2055.14]  I just
[2055.14 --> 2058.14]  I have such a hard time
[2058.14 --> 2061.14]  Ascending to that level of meme-y
[2061.14 --> 2062.14]  It's been pretty in
[2062.14 --> 2063.14]  Nick can do it
[2063.14 --> 2064.14]  Jake can do it
[2064.14 --> 2065.14]  Yeah
[2065.14 --> 2066.14]  Yeah
[2066.14 --> 2067.14]  Yeah
[2067.14 --> 2068.14]  Alex P
[2068.14 --> 2069.14]  A Prime
[2069.14 --> 2073.14]  You guys will probably know him as in the credits on the videos
[2073.14 --> 2077.14]  Those three are probably like peak meme-y around here
[2077.14 --> 2078.14]  Meme masters
[2078.14 --> 2079.14]  Yeah the meme masters
[2079.14 --> 2080.14]  The meme council
[2080.14 --> 2082.14]  The council of meme-ers
[2082.14 --> 2083.14]  Council of memes
[2083.14 --> 2084.14]  Council of memes
[2084.14 --> 2088.14]  You can join the council but we will not give you the rank of master
[2088.14 --> 2106.14]  Apple may be forced to ditch the lightning connector so word on the street is the EU will be voting on regulations that will require all mobile devices to use a single universal charging method
[2106.14 --> 2109.14]  Can I jump in and say I hate this?
[2111.14 --> 2114.14]  Honestly I'm really surprised so please continue
[2114.14 --> 2117.14]  Okay why don't we get through the rest of this
[2117.14 --> 2118.14]  Okay
[2118.14 --> 2120.14]  Well no no you know what no we're not going to
[2120.14 --> 2121.14]  I hate this
[2121.14 --> 2123.14]  Is it a stifling innovation angle?
[2123.14 --> 2124.14]  Forcing
[2124.14 --> 2127.14]  Not necessarily because I think stifling innovation
[2127.14 --> 2131.14]  Has become like a buzzword that just means
[2131.14 --> 2133.14]  allowing
[2133.14 --> 2138.14]  That means forcing us to not act in a non-competitive manner
[2139.14 --> 2142.14]  Like stifling innovation has just become
[2142.14 --> 2145.14]  Its meaning has become perverted I think
[2145.14 --> 2146.14]  Okay
[2146.14 --> 2148.14]  Just because of the way that it's been used so frequently
[2148.14 --> 2149.14]  Sure
[2149.14 --> 2151.14]  So the reason I hate this is that
[2153.14 --> 2155.14]  I think it's going to stifle innovation
[2156.14 --> 2157.14]  Okay not just not
[2157.14 --> 2158.14]  Yeah
[2158.14 --> 2159.14]  Okay shut up
[2159.14 --> 2160.14]  Yeah
[2160.14 --> 2161.14]  But not in that way
[2161.14 --> 2166.14]  Because the problem with standards
[2166.14 --> 2169.14]  Okay so we're lucky right now
[2169.14 --> 2172.14]  USBC is pretty great
[2172.14 --> 2173.14]  So it's more the future
[2173.14 --> 2174.14]  Yes
[2174.14 --> 2175.14]  Yeah I agree
[2175.14 --> 2176.14]  But where are we going from here?
[2176.14 --> 2177.14]  Yeah
[2177.14 --> 2180.14]  What happens when it's time for someone to create something different?
[2180.14 --> 2181.14]  Are you not allowed?
[2181.14 --> 2184.14]  Yeah because this whole thing went down ages ago
[2184.14 --> 2188.14]  The EU tried to go after Apple about the 40 pin connector way back in the day
[2188.14 --> 2189.14]  If I recall correctly
[2189.14 --> 2191.14]  It might have been the 40 pin might have been lightning
[2191.14 --> 2192.14]  Don't remember the time frame
[2192.14 --> 2198.14]  But ultimately what we got after the Apple 40 pin connector was lightning
[2198.14 --> 2205.14]  Which was so much better than anything that was available on the PC side of things
[2205.14 --> 2208.14]  Or on the like open standard side of things
[2208.14 --> 2209.14]  Yeah
[2209.14 --> 2211.14]  That it was almost worth switching to an iPhone for
[2211.14 --> 2213.14]  Remember this is pre-wireless charging
[2213.14 --> 2215.14]  And the lightning connector was great
[2215.14 --> 2217.14]  So I'm looking at it going okay
[2217.14 --> 2219.14]  At this moment in time
[2219.14 --> 2222.14]  USB type C looks pretty great
[2222.14 --> 2226.14]  Seems like it's working out pretty good so far
[2226.14 --> 2233.14]  We haven't so far identified any long term durability or reliability problems
[2233.14 --> 2234.14]  Yeah
[2234.14 --> 2235.14]  It holds up physically
[2235.14 --> 2237.14]  It holds up electrically for the most part
[2237.14 --> 2238.14]  Seems great
[2238.14 --> 2242.14]  But we don't have to go that far in the past to find a time
[2242.14 --> 2244.14]  When allowing someone to use a different connector
[2244.14 --> 2247.14]  Was a clear and obvious benefit for their customers
[2247.14 --> 2250.14]  And not to the detriment of the rest of the market
[2250.14 --> 2254.14]  Because Apple does charge to create works with Apple accessories
[2254.14 --> 2260.14]  But the flip side of that is that nothing prevents you from buying an unauthorized one off of eBay
[2260.14 --> 2263.14]  When we go back to like flip and slider phones
[2263.14 --> 2264.14]  Yeah
[2264.14 --> 2265.14]  It was horrible
[2265.14 --> 2266.14]  That was a gong show
[2266.14 --> 2267.14]  It was terrible
[2267.14 --> 2268.14]  It was terrible
[2268.14 --> 2273.14]  Because right now we have basically micro USB, USB-C and lightning
[2273.14 --> 2274.14]  Yes
[2274.14 --> 2275.14]  That's not that bad
[2275.14 --> 2276.14]  No
[2276.14 --> 2278.14]  And you have like a little bit older Android phones
[2278.14 --> 2279.14]  Yeah
[2279.14 --> 2280.14]  Current Android phones
[2280.14 --> 2281.14]  And iPhones
[2281.14 --> 2282.14]  The other
[2282.14 --> 2283.14]  And that's not that bad
[2283.14 --> 2293.14]  The other concern that I have is that these regulations in many cases technology regulations are created by people who do not fully understand what they're regulating
[2293.14 --> 2295.14]  They're often very important I want to throw that out there too
[2295.14 --> 2296.14]  Yes
[2296.14 --> 2303.14]  There are lots of very important technology regulations that keep things moving and we're very thankful for
[2303.14 --> 2306.14]  But yes, they're also often made by people that have no idea what they're talking about
[2306.14 --> 2313.14]  And even by engineers, USB type C is not particularly well understood in a lot of cases because
[2313.14 --> 2317.14]  Okay, you guys are a tech savvy audience, right?
[2317.14 --> 2323.14]  You see four USB-C connections on the back of the Apple Pro Display XDR
[2323.14 --> 2324.14]  Tell me what you think they are
[2324.14 --> 2326.14]  One of them has a little bolt next to it
[2326.14 --> 2328.14]  Tell me what they all are
[2328.14 --> 2329.14]  A thunderbolt
[2329.14 --> 2330.14]  Okay
[2330.14 --> 2332.14]  And three USB-C 3.1s
[2332.14 --> 2333.14]  Wrong
[2333.14 --> 2336.14]  Is one of them, one of them's power?
[2336.14 --> 2337.14]  No
[2337.14 --> 2339.14]  And the other ones don't allow that? No
[2339.14 --> 2340.14]  I have no idea
[2340.14 --> 2342.14]  Okay, see, that's the problem
[2342.14 --> 2345.14]  There are so many different implementations of USB-C
[2345.14 --> 2354.14]  The physical connector electrically that the potential for them to say, okay, well everything has to use USB type C
[2354.14 --> 2359.14]  Because that way everything can be charged from, you know, one thing
[2359.14 --> 2360.14]  What are they?
[2360.14 --> 2361.14]  What are they?
[2361.14 --> 2363.14]  Oh, so basically one of them is thunderbolt
[2363.14 --> 2364.14]  Okay
[2364.14 --> 2365.14]  And that goes to the Mac Pro
[2365.14 --> 2366.14]  Okay
[2366.14 --> 2367.14]  Or to your Macbook Pro
[2367.14 --> 2368.14]  Sure
[2368.14 --> 2370.14]  And the other three are actually USB type 2 electrically
[2370.14 --> 2371.14]  Okay
[2371.14 --> 2379.14]  And the reason is that Apple is using up all of the available bandwidth in that connection to put two DisplayPort streams through it
[2379.14 --> 2381.14]  Because that's how they're doing 6K 60Hz
[2381.14 --> 2382.14]  Okay
[2382.14 --> 2383.14]  Off of a single cable
[2383.14 --> 2384.14]  Okay
[2384.14 --> 2387.14]  Now they could have just done two cables which would have increased the backwards compatibility of the display
[2387.14 --> 2389.14]  But that wouldn't have been as elegant
[2389.14 --> 2390.14]  But they would never want to
[2390.14 --> 2391.14]  Yeah, okay
[2391.14 --> 2393.14]  Yeah, and that wouldn't have had, and it would have had high speed connectivity
[2394.14 --> 2395.14]  Whatever
[2395.14 --> 2396.14]  Okay, alright
[2396.14 --> 2406.14]  Anyway, so, sorry, so right, so there's so many different implementations that even if the intent was to say USB type C is the past, present, and future
[2406.14 --> 2411.14]  We want everything to use this so that you've got universal interoperability which gives consumers choice
[2411.14 --> 2414.14]  Now they can choose their vendor for their charging devices
[2414.14 --> 2415.14]  Even if that was the intent
[2415.14 --> 2417.14]  That might not actually be the result
[2417.14 --> 2422.14]  Because we've already seen with the Nintendo Switch getting bricked by power banks
[2422.14 --> 2425.14]  And non-authorized third party adapters
[2425.14 --> 2427.14]  That there are so many different implementations
[2427.14 --> 2430.14]  Some of them standard and some of them non-standard
[2430.14 --> 2433.14]  That there's no way that you would be able
[2433.14 --> 2437.14]  That you wouldn't have the understanding to regulate that properly
[2437.14 --> 2440.14]  And many devices just have different needs
[2440.14 --> 2444.14]  So that even though USB type C is a fantastic standard
[2444.14 --> 2450.14]  And has so many, so much flexibility in its implementation that allows it to be used for so many different things
[2450.14 --> 2456.14]  Everything from charging a laptop to outputting power off of your phone and charging something else
[2456.14 --> 2457.14]  It's so cool
[2457.14 --> 2462.14]  But that flexibility means that it's not one thing
[2462.14 --> 2470.14]  So trying to standardize on this one thing could actually hurt what is so great about this one thing
[2470.14 --> 2474.14]  And as far as my understanding goes, micro USB is wildly cheaper as well
[2474.14 --> 2478.14]  And we don't necessarily want to drive up the cost of a lot of low cost devices
[2478.14 --> 2483.14]  Yeah, like an IoT connected relay that you use for your garage door
[2483.14 --> 2485.14]  I have one that uses micro USB
[2485.14 --> 2491.14]  It significantly increases the complexity of implementing the charging port if they have to use USB type C
[2491.14 --> 2495.14]  And especially if it's a plug-in-once-leave-always-plugged-in style device
[2495.14 --> 2501.14]  You don't need really the features that USB-C give you if you can get everything else done by a micro USB connection
[2501.14 --> 2505.14]  With that said, we did find that USB type C was quite a bit more durable
[2505.14 --> 2511.14]  And I have had a fair number of micro Bs just from being left in
[2511.14 --> 2512.14]  Oh, just like kind of die
[2512.14 --> 2516.14]  But that I think has as much to do with it being a poor quality connector
[2516.14 --> 2516.64]  Yeah
[2516.64 --> 2518.14]  As it has to do with the actual standard itself
[2518.14 --> 2518.64]  Yeah
[2518.64 --> 2520.14]  So there's a different conversation to have there
[2520.14 --> 2524.14]  I mean that's another thing too is like if you're, unless you're regulating the quality of them as well
[2524.14 --> 2527.14]  And speaking of quality, this might be unpopular
[2527.14 --> 2529.14]  I personally like lightnings more than USB-C
[2529.14 --> 2533.14]  Oh, I love the lightning connector
[2533.14 --> 2534.14]  Yeah
[2534.14 --> 2538.14]  I mean Apple's like cable sleeving has had issues at times in the past
[2538.14 --> 2540.14]  But the actual lightning connector itself
[2540.14 --> 2542.14]  The actual connector
[2542.14 --> 2545.14]  The feel of the plug-in unplug experience is fantastic
[2545.14 --> 2546.14]  Yeah
[2546.14 --> 2547.14]  It does tend to get
[2547.14 --> 2552.14]  The Verge is reporting this is about the wall charger, not the actual plug on the phone
[2552.14 --> 2558.14]  Either way, that has its own separate, everything I said is already still applicable to that then
[2558.14 --> 2562.14]  So all these different implementations of powering devices
[2562.14 --> 2569.14]  Yeah, because, yeah, if you standardize the wall charger, you know, how would you keep tweaking with like your battery charge rates?
[2569.14 --> 2572.14]  Like your current delivery rates and all that kind of stuff
[2572.14 --> 2575.14]  Like there are advantages to having the charger talk to the device
[2575.14 --> 2576.14]  I'm not sure
[2576.14 --> 2577.14]  No, I still don't support it
[2577.14 --> 2578.14]  So there you go
[2578.14 --> 2583.14]  All right
[2583.14 --> 2584.14]  Well, what else?
[2584.14 --> 2586.14]  So, okay, let's go through our actual talking points for this thing
[2586.14 --> 2587.14]  Uh-oh
[2587.14 --> 2588.14]  Wife messaging
[2588.14 --> 2590.14]  Uh, okay, cool
[2590.14 --> 2591.14]  That's perfect
[2591.14 --> 2593.14]  Um, so something, something, something
[2593.14 --> 2597.14]  Require that all mobile devices use a single universal charging method
[2597.14 --> 2599.14]  Uh, Apple's response
[2599.14 --> 2600.14]  Oh, this is great
[2600.14 --> 2607.14]  Regulations that would drive conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones freeze innovation rather than encourage it
[2607.14 --> 2611.14]  Such proposals are bad for the environment and unnecessarily disruptive for customers
[2611.14 --> 2620.14]  I don't necessarily agree that they are bad for the environment because continuing to use your existing cables is definitely more better for the environment
[2620.14 --> 2621.14]  I could, I could
[2621.14 --> 2622.14]  Reduce is the best R
[2622.14 --> 2623.14]  I could, I could
[2623.14 --> 2624.14]  Is basically what I'm trying to say
[2624.14 --> 2631.14]  I could only understand the environment thing if it was used poetically and they mean like the, you know, environment of innovators
[2631.14 --> 2633.14]  Oh, like the metaphorical environment of
[2633.14 --> 2636.14]  Yeah, I'm sure they don't mean that but that's the only way that I could make it make sense
[2636.14 --> 2644.14]  Every time millions of people replace their cables and throw away their old cables, it is super bad for the environment
[2644.14 --> 2645.14]  Yeah, um
[2645.14 --> 2647.14]  That's a weird try to kind of hill to fall on
[2647.14 --> 2648.14]  Yeah, they go on
[2648.14 --> 2655.14]  We want to ensure that any new legislation will not result in the shipment of any unnecessary cables or external adapters with every device
[2655.14 --> 2660.14]  Or render obsolete the devices and accessories used by many millions of Europeans and hundreds of millions of Apple customers
[2660.14 --> 2661.14]  Oh, so that's great
[2661.14 --> 2663.14]  I see where their argument is coming from
[2663.14 --> 2670.14]  If we had to include an adapter to the thing that we're shipping everywhere else in the world because we're going to do that
[2670.14 --> 2675.14]  So basically they're just being petulant children that would rather do something that's bad for the environment
[2675.14 --> 2677.14]  Than just standardize
[2677.14 --> 2681.14]  So they're saying we will be bad for the environment if you do this
[2681.14 --> 2682.14]  If you make us do this
[2682.14 --> 2684.14]  Okay, that makes more sense
[2684.14 --> 2685.14]  So it's a threat
[2685.14 --> 2686.14]  Oh my god
[2686.14 --> 2687.14]  Not a warning
[2687.14 --> 2688.14]  Brutal
[2688.14 --> 2690.14]  Given the market steady switch to USB type C
[2690.14 --> 2693.14]  It's likely that this is the standard that will be adopted if it's passed
[2693.14 --> 2697.14]  And iPhones have been rumored to ditch lightning for type C for years
[2697.14 --> 2704.14]  But also recent rumors now point to a completely portless design with wireless charging and wireless data transfer only anyway
[2704.14 --> 2708.14]  And honestly, we're not far away from that actually kind of making sense
[2708.14 --> 2709.14]  Yeah
[2709.14 --> 2711.14]  Once you took the headphone jack out like
[2711.14 --> 2713.14]  Wi-Fi has gotten pretty fast
[2713.14 --> 2714.14]  Yeah
[2714.14 --> 2716.14]  And wireless charging has gotten pretty good
[2716.14 --> 2718.14]  People still transfer files through a cable to their phone
[2718.14 --> 2723.14]  On an iPhone I don't bother but on an Android device I kind of do a lot
[2723.14 --> 2725.14]  Interesting
[2725.14 --> 2726.14]  Why?
[2726.14 --> 2728.14]  Just because it's a lot faster
[2728.14 --> 2731.14]  Well remember too as a
[2731.14 --> 2733.14]  What are you transferring onto your phone?
[2733.14 --> 2735.14]  Like not onto my phone, off my phone
[2735.14 --> 2736.14]  Oh okay
[2736.14 --> 2739.14]  So as like a video maker I'm often doing screen cap on my phone that I need to
[2739.14 --> 2740.14]  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2740.14 --> 2741.14]  Okay
[2741.14 --> 2742.14]  Put onto an editor
[2742.14 --> 2743.14]  I was thinking the other way around so yeah
[2743.14 --> 2744.14]  No no
[2744.14 --> 2745.14]  You could have that auto sync
[2745.14 --> 2747.14]  Yeah no I don't put anything on my phone
[2747.14 --> 2752.14]  By the way I don't know if you've been using my Plex server lately but it's fixed now
[2752.14 --> 2753.14]  Oh no I haven't
[2753.14 --> 2754.14]  Okay
[2754.14 --> 2755.14]  Well it's fixed now
[2755.14 --> 2759.14]  Just reminded me cause like that's the only way I put things on my phone now
[2759.14 --> 2761.14]  Alright what else we got?
[2761.14 --> 2762.14]  Ah big news!
[2762.14 --> 2765.14]  Nvidia drops pricing on the RTX 2060
[2765.14 --> 2771.14]  It is now down to 299 also known as the price it probably should have been in the first place
[2771.14 --> 2778.14]  It was 350 and many partner cards are still at or near that price but the founders edition is now 299
[2778.14 --> 2784.14]  That brings the price closer to the rumored upcoming RX 5600 XT which is releasing on wait
[2784.14 --> 2791.14]  Okay hold on a second are these details that AMD has actually announced or are these things that people don't know yet?
[2791.14 --> 2794.14]  Hold on I'm just gonna control V
[2794.14 --> 2797.14]  Uh da da da da da da da da da da da da
[2797.14 --> 2798.14]  Okay uh
[2798.14 --> 2804.14]  AMD announced oh good AMD announces the RX 5600 XT on Tuesday for 279 okay so I can talk about that
[2804.14 --> 2805.14]  Talk about that
[2805.14 --> 2817.14]  Um the GTX 1660 Ti is still 279 so basically it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever given that you can get a 2060 for that with ray tracing
[2817.14 --> 2818.14]  Whoa!
[2818.14 --> 2820.14]  Which you probably wouldn't run around on there
[2820.14 --> 2821.14]  I do
[2821.14 --> 2822.14]  On a 2060?
[2822.14 --> 2823.14]  I do
[2823.14 --> 2824.14]  Oh
[2824.14 --> 2825.14]  Minecraft
[2825.14 --> 2829.14]  I think Minecraft with RTX is straight up
[2829.14 --> 2831.14]  Does it even do that well on a 2060?
[2831.14 --> 2832.14]  Minecraft RTX?
[2832.14 --> 2833.14]  Yeah
[2833.14 --> 2834.14]  Wait is it out?
[2834.14 --> 2835.14]  Uh
[2835.14 --> 2836.14]  It's not out yet
[2836.14 --> 2841.14]  No but they have like uh community mod demos that will like melt your computer
[2841.14 --> 2842.14]  Oh alright
[2842.14 --> 2845.14]  Well yeah but you don't have to do that many bounces
[2845.14 --> 2846.14]  I'm sure yes
[2846.14 --> 2847.14]  I'm sure you could run it
[2847.14 --> 2848.14]  I agree
[2848.14 --> 2851.14]  I think that's gonna be a valid use case for it
[2851.14 --> 2855.14]  With that said not on the LTT Minecraft server since we're running the Java version
[2855.14 --> 2858.14]  So that's gonna be a thing
[2858.14 --> 2859.14]  Okay
[2859.14 --> 2866.14]  Uh apparently I don't know if Jake has talked about this publicly yet but apparently we are finally launching in the next couple of weeks
[2866.14 --> 2870.14]  Really? Cause it's been like a long time
[2870.14 --> 2871.14]  Look
[2871.14 --> 2874.14]  Four or five months?
[2874.14 --> 2875.14]  Meat kettle
[2875.14 --> 2876.14]  Meat kettle
[2876.14 --> 2877.14]  Okay
[2877.14 --> 2878.14]  Alright
[2878.14 --> 2879.14]  Okay
[2879.14 --> 2880.14]  Alright
[2880.14 --> 2882.14]  I mean it's a Minecraft server
[2882.14 --> 2883.14]  Versus
[2883.14 --> 2885.14]  Have you seen what they've been working on though?
[2885.14 --> 2886.14]  It's actually pretty cool
[2886.14 --> 2887.14]  It's uh
[2887.14 --> 2888.14]  Video delivery?
[2888.14 --> 2889.14]  Minecraft server?
[2889.14 --> 2890.14]  I'm just
[2890.14 --> 2893.14]  Yeah but like he also didn't take three years so
[2893.14 --> 2894.14]  Okay alright
[2894.14 --> 2895.14]  Okay
[2895.14 --> 2896.14]  You know
[2896.14 --> 2897.14]  You know
[2897.14 --> 2898.14]  You know
[2898.14 --> 2899.14]  That's fine
[2899.14 --> 2900.14]  Anyway
[2900.14 --> 2901.14]  Um
[2901.14 --> 2904.14]  What else we got that we wanted to talk about?
[2904.14 --> 2906.14]  Oh yeah this is the craziest thing ever
[2906.14 --> 2910.14]  Okay so scientists use stem cells from frogs to build the first living robots
[2910.14 --> 2912.14]  So this is out of the University of Vermont
[2912.14 --> 2913.14]  What?
[2913.14 --> 2914.14]  Xenobots
[2914.14 --> 2917.14]  So these are robots that are constructed out of living cells
[2917.14 --> 2918.14]  Um
[2918.14 --> 2920.14]  They're made from embryonic African clawed frogs
[2920.14 --> 2925.14]  So these are tiny sub-millimeter blobs that have between 500 and 1000 cells
[2925.14 --> 2926.14]  They can scoot around
[2926.14 --> 2927.14]  They can self-organize
[2927.14 --> 2930.14]  And they can deliver minute payloads
[2930.14 --> 2932.14]  Potential uses include targeted drug delivery
[2932.14 --> 2933.14]  Yeah that totally makes sense
[2933.14 --> 2934.14]  Um
[2934.14 --> 2937.14]  So unlike any previous living organism
[2937.14 --> 2940.14]  These are living programmable organisms
[2940.14 --> 2943.14]  This is nuts
[2943.14 --> 2945.14]  So they're 100% frog DNA
[2945.14 --> 2946.14]  But they are not frogs
[2946.14 --> 2948.14]  That is extremely cool
[2948.14 --> 2950.14]  And very terrifying
[2950.14 --> 2951.14]  Yeah
[2951.14 --> 2952.14]  Like
[2952.14 --> 2953.14]  Imagine
[2953.14 --> 2954.14]  Like
[2954.14 --> 2955.14]  Chemical warfare
[2955.14 --> 2956.14]  Nuclear warfare
[2956.14 --> 2957.14]  Nuclear warfare
[2957.14 --> 2959.14]  Those are not the scariest warfares anymore
[2959.14 --> 2960.14]  Well
[2960.14 --> 2961.14]  This would
[2961.14 --> 2962.14]  Is it chemical?
[2962.14 --> 2963.14]  It's
[2963.14 --> 2964.14]  Okay
[2964.14 --> 2965.14]  It's biological warfare
[2965.14 --> 2966.14]  Biological
[2966.14 --> 2967.14]  Which I guess also
[2967.14 --> 2968.14]  You know exists
[2968.14 --> 2969.14]  But this is like
[2969.14 --> 2970.14]  I don't know
[2970.14 --> 2971.14]  This feels like
[2971.14 --> 2972.14]  A new category
[2972.14 --> 2974.14]  A new category to me somehow
[2974.14 --> 2975.14]  Micro biological
[2975.14 --> 2976.14]  No
[2976.14 --> 2977.14]  Cause there it is
[2977.14 --> 2978.14]  You drop
[2978.14 --> 2979.14]  You drop a bunch of these
[2979.14 --> 2980.14]  In like
[2980.14 --> 2981.14]  In like a water supply
[2981.14 --> 2982.14]  Or something
[2982.14 --> 2984.14]  And they like
[2984.14 --> 2985.14]  You know
[2985.14 --> 2986.14]  Deliver
[2986.14 --> 2987.14]  Execute program
[2987.14 --> 2988.14]  66
[2988.14 --> 2989.14]  Eat brains
[2989.14 --> 2990.14]  I don't know
[2990.14 --> 2991.14]  Right?
[2991.14 --> 2992.14]  Yeah, yeah
[2992.14 --> 2993.14]  Interesting
[2993.14 --> 2994.14]  Like depending on
[2994.14 --> 2996.14]  If how long they can stay alive
[2996.14 --> 2997.14]  In a target's bloodstream
[2997.14 --> 2998.14]  Right
[2998.14 --> 2999.14]  You know you could potentially
[2999.14 --> 3001.14]  Over some very extended period of time
[3001.14 --> 3003.14]  Basically infect an entire population
[3003.14 --> 3004.14]  Should be like
[3004.14 --> 3005.14]  Hey
[3005.14 --> 3006.14]  I mean obviously
[3006.14 --> 3007.14]  They have no way at this time
[3007.14 --> 3008.14]  To put
[3008.14 --> 3009.14]  Frickin Wi-Fi on the things
[3009.14 --> 3010.14]  But like
[3010.14 --> 3011.14]  And I'm sure
[3011.14 --> 3012.14]  I'm not putting ideas
[3012.14 --> 3014.14]  That weren't already there
[3014.14 --> 3015.14]  Into people's heads
[3015.14 --> 3016.14]  So don't worry about it
[3016.14 --> 3017.14]  But
[3017.14 --> 3018.14]  Consume and grow
[3018.14 --> 3020.14]  Would like
[3020.14 --> 3022.14]  Very possibly be an option
[3022.14 --> 3023.14]  And that's essentially just cancer
[3023.14 --> 3024.14]  Is it not?
[3024.14 --> 3026.14]  Deliverable cancer?
[3026.14 --> 3027.14]  Deliverable cancer?
[3027.14 --> 3028.14]  That sucks
[3028.14 --> 3029.14]  Yeah
[3029.14 --> 3030.14]  But
[3030.14 --> 3031.14]  Also
[3031.14 --> 3032.14]  Maybe counter it
[3032.14 --> 3033.14]  At the same time
[3033.14 --> 3034.14]  Really interesting
[3034.14 --> 3036.14]  Very interested to see where that goes
[3036.14 --> 3037.14]  Hopefully
[3037.14 --> 3038.14]  All in good directions
[3038.14 --> 3039.14]  In other news
[3039.14 --> 3040.14]  This is off of
[3040.14 --> 3041.14]  Cooler Master's Twitter
[3041.14 --> 3044.14]  Cooler Master has changed the design
[3044.14 --> 3045.14]  Of their
[3045.14 --> 3047.14]  Thermal paste syringe
[3047.14 --> 3050.14]  Not to make applying thermal paste easier
[3050.14 --> 3051.14]  But because
[3051.14 --> 3052.14]  They were tired of having to explain to parents
[3052.14 --> 3053.14]  That their kid isn't using drugs
[3053.14 --> 3055.14]  I think Cooler Master
[3055.14 --> 3057.14]  Is
[3057.14 --> 3058.14]  Social media savvy enough
[3058.14 --> 3059.14]  That
[3059.14 --> 3060.14]  That they're lying out of their teeth
[3060.14 --> 3061.14]  This is not what happened
[3061.14 --> 3062.14]  But
[3062.14 --> 3063.14]  It's very funny
[3063.14 --> 3064.14]  So good job Cooler Master
[3064.14 --> 3065.14]  Okay hold on hold on
[3065.14 --> 3066.14]  Switch to my screen
[3066.14 --> 3067.14]  Uh yes
[3067.14 --> 3068.14]  This is their video
[3068.14 --> 3070.14]  I'm gonna mute it just cause I don't know if it's coming through or not
[3070.14 --> 3071.14]  This is their video
[3071.14 --> 3074.14]  I just wanna see if you notice what's wrong
[3080.14 --> 3081.14]  Did you see it?
[3082.14 --> 3083.14]  Go back
[3085.14 --> 3087.14]  Master Gel Maker
[3087.14 --> 3089.14]  Traditional Thermal Grease
[3089.14 --> 3090.14]  Which is hard to spread
[3090.14 --> 3091.14]  You skipped over it
[3091.14 --> 3092.14]  Traditional Thermal Grease
[3092.14 --> 3093.14]  Oh
[3093.14 --> 3094.14]  All capitalized
[3094.14 --> 3097.14]  I did notice that Thermal Grease was capitalized
[3097.14 --> 3098.14]  Um
[3098.14 --> 3099.14]  Traditional Thermal Grease
[3099.14 --> 3100.14]  Traditional
[3100.14 --> 3101.14]  Oh Cooler Master you tried
[3101.14 --> 3103.14]  It's and then they do the classic like infomercial
[3103.14 --> 3106.14]  I can't do this super simple task at all
[3106.14 --> 3108.14]  They had to have done that on purpose too
[3108.14 --> 3109.14]  Ugh
[3109.14 --> 3110.14]  It's so difficult
[3110.14 --> 3112.14]  Also that's spread enough at this point
[3112.14 --> 3113.14]  They're just
[3113.14 --> 3114.14]  Nope nope need to keep going
[3116.14 --> 3117.14]  Ugh
[3117.14 --> 3118.14]  I don't know
[3118.14 --> 3119.14]  With patent
[3119.14 --> 3122.14]  That's a fun grammar bit right there
[3123.14 --> 3127.14]  Man you know the craziest thing about like companies like Cooler Master
[3127.14 --> 3133.14]  Is they actually have a lot of people who work there who could easily proof this
[3133.14 --> 3134.14]  Okay what do you think
[3134.14 --> 3135.14]  They just don't have them do it
[3135.14 --> 3136.14]  Yeah
[3136.14 --> 3137.14]  I think it's stupid
[3137.14 --> 3138.14]  Yeah
[3138.14 --> 3139.14]  And unnecessary
[3139.14 --> 3140.14]  Yeah
[3140.14 --> 3141.14]  Um
[3141.14 --> 3144.14]  But I think anything that gives new users more confidence to do something
[3144.14 --> 3145.14]  Okay
[3145.14 --> 3146.14]  Can actually have a clear benefit
[3146.14 --> 3147.14]  That's a cool angle
[3147.14 --> 3148.14]  I like that
[3148.14 --> 3149.14]  Yeah
[3149.14 --> 3150.14]  Yeah
[3150.14 --> 3152.14]  It does nothing for the actual thermal performance
[3152.14 --> 3153.14]  Still kinda neat
[3153.14 --> 3159.14]  The first initial thought that I had was like that's a confusing low value
[3159.14 --> 3165.14]  I'm assuming notable increase to bomb cost change that I just don't understand
[3165.14 --> 3170.14]  But if it's increasing confidence cause that is a part that has always bothered people
[3170.14 --> 3171.14]  And it made us talk about it
[3171.14 --> 3172.14]  It did
[3172.14 --> 3174.14]  Good job Cooler Master Marketing team
[3174.14 --> 3175.14]  Yeah there you go
[3175.14 --> 3177.14]  Spelling things wrong was the play
[3177.14 --> 3178.14]  You got it
[3178.14 --> 3183.14]  Corsair IQ to support Asus motherboard RGB lighting control
[3183.14 --> 3187.14]  Have we finally reached RGB-topia?
[3187.14 --> 3192.14]  Arguably the two best RGB solutions IQ and RSync are now compatible
[3192.14 --> 3196.14]  So you can get a cohesive RGB look without using 20% of your CPU
[3196.14 --> 3197.14]  Thank you
[3197.14 --> 3200.14]  It seems simple but syncing RGB can actually be really tough
[3200.14 --> 3204.14]  I know Corsair has spent an inordinate amount of money on RGB development
[3204.14 --> 3206.14]  Like it just blew me away
[3206.14 --> 3212.14]  Each component RAM, MOBO, GPU could run very different software and hardware for RGB
[3212.14 --> 3213.14]  If they're designed
[3213.14 --> 3215.14]  Even if they're designed by different teams within the same company
[3215.14 --> 3217.14]  They can run really different stuff
[3217.14 --> 3221.14]  So what one company or team calls blue in their software might be different from others
[3221.14 --> 3225.14]  Even more difficult for colors like orange where two lights have to be dimmed correctly in order to color match
[3225.14 --> 3227.14]  Various controllers will have different built-in delays
[3227.14 --> 3229.14]  So even if the main software is sending out the right signals
[3229.14 --> 3231.14]  The whole thing could look like a mess
[3231.14 --> 3232.14]  And on top of it all
[3232.14 --> 3235.14]  All the hardware needs to comply with all the electronics laws
[3235.14 --> 3240.14]  I actually found out recently that one of the reasons that RGB doesn't just all sync wirelessly
[3240.14 --> 3243.14]  Instead of having to do all this crap
[3243.14 --> 3248.14]  Is that it has to do with the European RF pollution laws
[3248.14 --> 3249.14]  Yeah, okay
[3249.14 --> 3252.14]  Yeah, so I was like, oh, alright
[3252.14 --> 3254.14]  Yeah, I guess that makes sense
[3254.14 --> 3255.14]  It's like why I had to
[3255.14 --> 3263.14]  Get my Logitech PowerPlay mouse mat in Canada
[3263.14 --> 3264.14]  Get it?
[3264.14 --> 3265.14]  Cause they don't sell it here
[3265.14 --> 3266.14]  They don't sell it here
[3266.14 --> 3267.14]  No
[3267.14 --> 3269.14]  I actually did not know that
[3269.14 --> 3270.14]  I never went to buy one
[3270.14 --> 3271.14]  They sent one for review
[3271.14 --> 3274.14]  I need a new mouse cause mine double clicks like all the time
[3274.14 --> 3275.14]  But I love it
[3275.14 --> 3277.14]  I'd never want to go back if I can
[3277.14 --> 3278.14]  I wish they made a much bigger mouse mat
[3278.14 --> 3279.14]  Yeah
[3279.14 --> 3280.14]  I know you can like do it yourself
[3280.14 --> 3281.14]  You can mod it
[3281.14 --> 3282.14]  But it's
[3282.14 --> 3283.14]  You gotta do it
[3283.14 --> 3284.14]  I will
[3284.14 --> 3285.14]  Okay
[3285.14 --> 3286.14]  Yeah
[3286.14 --> 3287.14]  That's the way to go
[3287.14 --> 3288.14]  You just get the other one
[3288.14 --> 3289.14]  You cut the hole
[3289.14 --> 3291.14]  Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay
[3291.14 --> 3292.14]  Yeah
[3292.14 --> 3294.14]  Okay, so two random things
[3294.14 --> 3297.14]  I got this super early
[3297.14 --> 3299.14]  Which I'm ridiculously excited about
[3299.14 --> 3300.14]  Oh, good for you
[3300.14 --> 3303.14]  You're now the only one in this room with a working valve index
[3303.14 --> 3305.14]  Okay, so you mentioned that before the show
[3305.14 --> 3306.14]  But we didn't get into it
[3306.14 --> 3307.14]  What happened?
[3307.14 --> 3308.14]  Well, my controller broke
[3308.14 --> 3309.14]  Your controller broke?
[3309.14 --> 3310.14]  Yeah
[3310.14 --> 3311.14]  My controller
[3311.14 --> 3314.14]  It started kind of disconnecting sometimes
[3314.14 --> 3315.14]  Then I would power it off and power it back on
[3315.14 --> 3316.14]  And it would kick back in
[3316.14 --> 3319.14]  And then it did it again
[3319.14 --> 3320.14]  And then it like
[3320.14 --> 3321.14]  Is this your
[3321.14 --> 3323.14]  It happened more and more frequently until it did it
[3323.14 --> 3324.14]  And then it didn't turn back on
[3324.14 --> 3325.14]  Is this your knuckles?
[3325.14 --> 3326.14]  Yeah
[3326.14 --> 3329.14]  Yeah, so my left knuckles controller is dead
[3329.14 --> 3330.14]  You can use the older ones, right?
[3330.14 --> 3331.14]  Can't you?
[3331.14 --> 3332.14]  Okay, so that was a bit of a
[3332.14 --> 3334.14]  Bit of a fiasco ordeal
[3334.14 --> 3335.14]  It was a bit of a pain in the butt
[3335.14 --> 3337.14]  Because I am using Lighthouse V2s
[3337.14 --> 3342.14]  I don't own any Vive Gen 2 controllers
[3342.14 --> 3343.14]  Okay
[3343.14 --> 3345.14]  Any like SteamVR 2.0 controllers
[3345.14 --> 3347.14]  So I had to come back to work
[3347.14 --> 3348.14]  Borrow some controllers
[3348.14 --> 3349.14]  Go home
[3349.14 --> 3352.14]  Realize that my lighthouses were not compatible
[3352.14 --> 3353.14]  With my Gen 1 controllers
[3353.14 --> 3355.14]  Go back to the office
[3355.14 --> 3358.14]  Get Gen 1 lighthouses
[3358.14 --> 3361.14]  Which conveniently do work with the index headset
[3361.14 --> 3363.14]  And then I was able to play
[3363.14 --> 3365.14]  But yes, I've been
[3365.14 --> 3366.14]  I've been
[3366.14 --> 3367.14]  I've been
[3367.14 --> 3368.14]  I've been
[3368.14 --> 3369.14]  Out of the game for a little bit
[3369.14 --> 3370.14]  I've been playing a little bit
[3370.14 --> 3371.14]  But not nearly as much
[3371.14 --> 3373.14]  I don't like using the Gen 1 controllers as much
[3373.14 --> 3374.14]  They're really heavy and I'm weak
[3375.14 --> 3377.14]  It's a weight thing
[3377.14 --> 3378.14]  Well, it's a factor
[3378.14 --> 3379.14]  Yeah
[3379.14 --> 3380.14]  I also don't find them as comfortable
[3380.14 --> 3382.14]  I'm really used to the Valve ones
[3382.14 --> 3383.14]  To the Valve ones now
[3383.14 --> 3384.14]  You really like Beat Saber
[3384.14 --> 3385.14]  Which is a lot of constant movement
[3385.14 --> 3386.14]  Yes
[3386.14 --> 3387.14]  So that sort of would add up
[3387.14 --> 3389.14]  And sometimes I'm streaming for an hour
[3389.14 --> 3390.14]  Or two hours at a time
[3390.14 --> 3392.14]  And it really does make a difference
[3392.14 --> 3393.14]  Yeah
[3393.14 --> 3394.14]  Okay, that makes sense
[3394.14 --> 3395.14]  So there's that
[3395.14 --> 3396.14]  And the knuckles are very like
[3396.14 --> 3397.14]  When something's kind of attached to you
[3397.14 --> 3399.14]  The weight gets distributed a lot better
[3399.14 --> 3400.14]  Yes
[3400.14 --> 3401.14]  Compared to like a stick that you have to hold
[3401.14 --> 3402.14]  Or whatever
[3402.14 --> 3403.14]  Absolutely
[3403.14 --> 3404.14]  Okay, so that I got this
[3404.14 --> 3405.14]  Which is fantastic
[3405.14 --> 3406.14]  Did you just get that today?
[3406.14 --> 3407.14]  Yeah
[3407.14 --> 3408.14]  Nice
[3408.14 --> 3409.14]  It's super early
[3409.14 --> 3410.14]  If I remember correctly
[3410.14 --> 3411.14]  My order was supposed to come in March
[3411.14 --> 3412.14]  Nice
[3412.14 --> 3413.14]  Like it's wicked early
[3413.14 --> 3414.14]  I don't know why
[3414.14 --> 3415.14]  I was
[3415.14 --> 3416.14]  It was here
[3416.14 --> 3417.14]  You need your left controller?
[3417.14 --> 3418.14]  Yeah, yeah
[3418.14 --> 3419.14]  Yeah, yeah
[3419.14 --> 3420.14]  I think so
[3420.14 --> 3421.14]  Actually, I mean honestly
[3421.14 --> 3422.14]  You could borrow it
[3422.14 --> 3423.14]  Because I can't set it up yet
[3423.14 --> 3424.14]  Oh, no, it's fine
[3424.14 --> 3425.14]  I wasn't like the room isn't ready
[3425.14 --> 3427.14]  Like I didn't think it was going to be here for a long time
[3427.14 --> 3428.14]  It's fine, I can wait
[3428.14 --> 3430.14]  They have finally shipped me one
[3430.14 --> 3431.14]  So I'm good
[3431.14 --> 3432.14]  Okay, that's cool
[3432.14 --> 3435.14]  Took them like 13 days to decide to ship me a replacement
[3435.14 --> 3436.14]  So that was pretty sweet
[3436.14 --> 3437.14]  That's kind of annoying
[3437.14 --> 3439.14]  Speaking of annoying though
[3439.14 --> 3440.14]  This is a, like I said
[3440.14 --> 3441.14]  This is here that's great
[3441.14 --> 3443.14]  I got banned from WoW for six months
[3443.14 --> 3445.14]  You got banned from WoW
[3445.14 --> 3446.14]  Suspended
[3446.14 --> 3447.14]  Why?
[3447.14 --> 3448.14]  I'll get into that
[3448.14 --> 3449.14]  Why did you get suspended from
[3449.14 --> 3450.14]  What did you do?
[3450.14 --> 3453.14]  I genuinely don't know
[3453.14 --> 3456.14]  That's the worst part
[3456.14 --> 3457.14]  I went to go
[3457.14 --> 3459.14]  This, it's been for a week
[3459.14 --> 3462.14]  I went home after last WAN show
[3462.14 --> 3463.14]  Yeah
[3463.14 --> 3464.14]  And went and logged in
[3464.14 --> 3466.14]  It was like your account is suspended for 180 days
[3466.14 --> 3467.14]  And I was like
[3467.14 --> 3468.14]  What?
[3468.14 --> 3472.14]  Maybe Blizzard's trying to tell you you have a problem
[3472.14 --> 3474.14]  And that WoW Classic isn't that good of a game anyway
[3474.14 --> 3477.14]  Okay, WoW Classic has a lot of issues
[3477.14 --> 3479.14]  I will give you that
[3479.14 --> 3480.14]  But it's like
[3480.14 --> 3482.14]  Maybe Blizzard said you know what?
[3482.14 --> 3485.14]  We've consumed enough of this man's life and soul
[3485.14 --> 3486.14]  But it's not even
[3486.14 --> 3488.14]  I play with my dad and my brother and my mom
[3488.14 --> 3490.14]  Like just a little while ago
[3490.14 --> 3491.14]  I was in a dungeon with my brat
[3491.14 --> 3493.14]  My dad, my brother and mom
[3493.14 --> 3495.14]  What?
[3495.14 --> 3496.14]  What?
[3498.14 --> 3499.14]  A while ago
[3499.14 --> 3500.14]  I said just a while ago
[3500.14 --> 3501.14]  It's fine
[3502.14 --> 3504.14]  I'm not gonna say exactly how many days ago
[3504.14 --> 3505.14]  But it was a while ago
[3506.14 --> 3507.14]  Hold on, hold on
[3507.14 --> 3508.14]  Let me say that out loud for you
[3508.14 --> 3510.14]  So you can hear it instead of being saying it
[3511.14 --> 3512.14]  Okay
[3512.14 --> 3513.14]  A little while ago
[3513.14 --> 3515.14]  I was in a dungeon with my brother, my dad and my mom
[3517.14 --> 3520.14]  See, because I play WoW so much this doesn't ping me
[3522.14 --> 3524.14]  Well there's lots of kinds of dungeons
[3525.14 --> 3526.14]  Don't worry about it
[3528.14 --> 3529.14]  Like okay, the day
[3529.14 --> 3531.14]  I'm gonna get a little personal here for a moment
[3531.14 --> 3532.14]  Sure
[3532.14 --> 3536.14]  But the day that my mom or my grandma on my dad's side
[3536.14 --> 3537.14]  Yeah
[3537.14 --> 3538.14]  Passed away
[3538.14 --> 3539.14]  Or not passed away, her funeral
[3539.14 --> 3540.14]  Right
[3540.14 --> 3542.14]  Was the launch day of Classic WoW
[3543.14 --> 3546.14]  This man allowed me to borrow a bunch of laptops
[3546.14 --> 3548.14]  And I flew across the country
[3548.14 --> 3549.14]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
[3549.14 --> 3551.14]  And we had like a LAN party in the hotel room that night
[3551.14 --> 3552.14]  Good old classic WoW style
[3552.14 --> 3554.14]  To try to like bring the family together
[3554.14 --> 3556.14]  Now my brother and my dad and I all raid together
[3557.14 --> 3559.14]  And it's like a thing
[3559.14 --> 3560.14]  So it really sucks
[3560.14 --> 3561.14]  And I don't know why
[3561.14 --> 3562.14]  Yeah
[3562.14 --> 3564.14]  And I have appealed it three times
[3564.14 --> 3566.14]  I've gotten automated responses back every time
[3566.14 --> 3569.14]  Just being like, nope, nope, nope, six months, bye
[3569.14 --> 3571.14]  And you still don't even know what it was
[3571.14 --> 3572.14]  And you still don't even know what it was
[3572.14 --> 3573.14]  I can't get to a single
[3573.14 --> 3574.14]  They said cheating
[3574.14 --> 3576.14]  And I was like, what?
[3576.14 --> 3578.14]  I haven't done this?
[3578.14 --> 3580.14]  So they're like, oh, it's for unauthorized program use?
[3580.14 --> 3582.14]  What is unauthorized program use?
[3582.14 --> 3583.14]  What program?
[3583.14 --> 3585.14]  Like I use my computer for everything
[3585.14 --> 3586.14]  I stream on it
[3586.14 --> 3587.14]  I work on it
[3587.14 --> 3588.14]  Yeah
[3588.14 --> 3589.14]  I game on it
[3589.14 --> 3590.14]  I don't know what program
[3590.14 --> 3591.14]  What program are you upset about?
[3591.14 --> 3592.14]  So I don't get banned in the future
[3592.14 --> 3594.14]  And they're just like, nope, stop sending in tickets
[3594.14 --> 3595.14]  Blup
[3595.14 --> 3599.14]  They're all automated responses
[3599.14 --> 3600.14]  So no one's really saying that
[3600.14 --> 3601.14]  Right
[3601.14 --> 3602.14]  But like, I just, I don't know
[3602.14 --> 3603.14]  If someone out there
[3603.14 --> 3605.14]  Works at Blizzard
[3605.14 --> 3606.14]  Knows a senior jam or something
[3606.14 --> 3607.14]  I would love to talk to you
[3608.14 --> 3610.14]  You can even leave the ban
[3610.14 --> 3612.14]  I just don't want to get banned again
[3612.14 --> 3613.14]  Right
[3613.14 --> 3614.14]  Because you're back for like two days
[3614.14 --> 3615.14]  You get banned for another six months
[3615.14 --> 3616.14]  That's a good year
[3616.14 --> 3617.14]  Because I don't even know why
[3617.14 --> 3618.14]  Yeah
[3618.14 --> 3619.14]  It's ridiculous
[3619.14 --> 3620.14]  Huh
[3620.14 --> 3621.14]  I can't talk to
[3621.14 --> 3622.14]  Like when I used to have
[3622.14 --> 3623.14]  If I ever had a problem with Blizzard
[3623.14 --> 3624.14]  Yeah
[3624.14 --> 3625.14]  When I first started playing WoW
[3625.14 --> 3626.14]  You can just call them
[3626.14 --> 3628.14]  Well yeah, but that was a long time ago
[3628.14 --> 3629.14]  Yeah
[3629.14 --> 3630.14]  But I think
[3630.14 --> 3631.14]  They had a big player base
[3631.14 --> 3632.14]  You know the funny thing about that
[3632.14 --> 3633.14]  Is that like
[3633.14 --> 3636.14]  It's not like they get paid less
[3636.14 --> 3637.14]  Now
[3637.14 --> 3638.14]  Yeah
[3638.14 --> 3640.14]  But somehow they were able to sustain
[3640.14 --> 3642.14]  Support staff back then
[3642.14 --> 3643.14]  Why can't they now?
[3643.14 --> 3644.14]  I don't know
[3644.14 --> 3645.14]  I don't know
[3645.14 --> 3646.14]  When did we all as consumers
[3646.14 --> 3647.14]  Accept this?
[3647.14 --> 3648.14]  And like
[3648.14 --> 3650.14]  I even said that in one of my tickets
[3650.14 --> 3651.14]  Yeah
[3651.14 --> 3654.14]  I understand you guys are probably receiving a lot of tickets right now
[3654.14 --> 3656.14]  I'd love to just
[3656.14 --> 3658.14]  Like if I can just talk to someone
[3658.14 --> 3660.14]  We can probably smooth this over
[3660.14 --> 3661.14]  Yeah
[3661.14 --> 3662.14]  And we can just move on
[3662.14 --> 3663.14]  Yeah
[3663.14 --> 3664.14]  Automated response, denied, whatever
[3664.14 --> 3665.14]  I just, I don't know
[3665.14 --> 3666.14]  I would just love to talk to someone
[3666.14 --> 3668.14]  So I can at least like explain my case
[3668.14 --> 3670.14]  I'd like to play games with my dad again
[3670.14 --> 3672.14]  That was like a cool thing that we had
[3672.14 --> 3676.14]  I would love to just talk to someone
[3676.14 --> 3677.14]  So if anyone out there
[3677.14 --> 3678.14]  Can just reach out to me
[3678.14 --> 3679.14]  That would be fantastic
[3679.14 --> 3680.14]  Because I'm getting nowhere on my own
[3680.14 --> 3681.14]  Yep
[3681.14 --> 3682.14]  Alright
[3682.14 --> 3683.14]  Yeah
[3683.14 --> 3685.14]  Speaking of getting nowhere
[3685.14 --> 3687.14]  You can take a controller
[3687.14 --> 3688.14]  No
[3688.14 --> 3689.14]  Like I literally can't set it up
[3689.14 --> 3690.14]  It might be at home
[3690.14 --> 3691.14]  Oh
[3691.14 --> 3692.14]  Like they shipped it a few days ago
[3692.14 --> 3693.14]  And it's been snowy
[3693.14 --> 3694.14]  So I think it might have gotten delayed
[3694.14 --> 3696.14]  But it also like might be there by now
[3696.14 --> 3697.14]  So I'm not too worried about that
[3697.14 --> 3698.14]  Yeah we're making rearrangements
[3698.14 --> 3700.14]  And we're like literally in the process of it
[3700.14 --> 3702.14]  But I didn't know it was going to be here so soon
[3702.14 --> 3703.14]  So it's not ready yet
[3703.14 --> 3705.14]  Alright so thanks for watching this week guys
[3705.14 --> 3706.14]  We'll see you again next week
[3706.14 --> 3708.14]  Same bad time same bad channel
[3708.14 --> 3709.14]  Jaden you're a dick
