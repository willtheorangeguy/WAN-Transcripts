[0.56 → 5.76] it's like me out of Google oh right when i went to refresh the live page i can't tell
[5.76 → 14.48] if we're live thank you for that YouTube i don't see it and welcome to the lag show ladies and
[14.48 → 18.96] gentlemen we have a fantastic show for you guys today I'm going to tell you all about it
[18.96 → 25.84] once my Google Docs signs back in there it is NVIDIA's bonched launch
[25.84 → 33.84] botched launch ampere we've got 3080 shipping without boxes we've got crashing games we've
[33.84 → 40.72] got a titan class disappointment in the form of the 3090 this was written by uh one of the
[40.72 → 45.68] writers put this headline this intentionally sensationalist headline we're
[45.68 → 50.64] going to talk about some of the challenges that NVIDIA has gone through launching their ampere
[50.64 → 59.36] graphics cards in other small and inconsequential news Microsoft buys genome for 7.5 billion
[59.68 → 66.72] dollars yes my friends inconsequential the days of independent developers are over, but that's old news
[67.28 → 76.72] now the days of large enormous conglomerate developers are also over it's its all just going to be one
[76.72 → 83.68] developer oh what else we got Luke i uh i also got signed out of the dock right after you
[83.68 → 90.40] did so i am working on that right now fantastic why don't I just do two more big Nazi may be faster
[90.40 → 98.16] than the RTX 3080 that's right my friends we've got more hype train news for an AMD graphics card colour me
[98.16 → 110.72] really, really skeptical and in other news Spotify tile proton mail and base camp join epic against apple
[111.28 → 117.36] they're calling it the coalition for app fairness or the calf
[117.36 → 122.40] the calf
[123.20 → 129.60] just hope it don't get slaughtered i feel like we weren't invited i i rolled the intro already
[130.24 → 135.36] oh nice I'm going to turn up the volume people have been complaining about the volume of the intro there you go
[135.36 → 143.52] that better you guys like that you like that intro volume okay you good you okay you guys okay now
[143.52 → 151.76] show is brought to you today by the steel series rival three wireless wow i don't think we've worked
[151.76 → 158.48] with steel series in a long time that's sweet they're back everyone comes crawling back Messi footwear
[158.48 → 167.28] and of course ridge wallet that's right if you drop your wallet off a ridge you want one that's going to survive
[167.28 → 175.52] the fall yeah i don't think it's being here survive the fall yeah um awesome and i were talking about
[175.52 → 179.84] this is off-topic I'll try to make it quick sure awesome i were talking about highlander
[179.84 → 183.76] and i brought up how I've been like trying to brainstorm a new one for years but I've never
[183.76 → 188.48] thought of something that's like really actually cool oh no what are you pitching me right now
[188.48 → 197.84] an interesting idea, and he said he would be in for it, i don't know it's got some you know but an
[197.84 → 205.68] interesting idea could be going to Death Valley where it's obscenely hot the world's hottest land
[205.68 → 212.40] party, and we try to keep all the pcs running because it gets like 50 degrees there doesn't it
[212.40 → 219.52] it you could it is gets real freaking hot, and you could even set it up as maybe a competition like
[219.52 → 226.56] a benchmarking competition that's very interesting, so the thing is i actually had the concept a long
[226.56 → 232.32] time ago like i probably talked to you about this way back in the day of doing like uh like kind of
[232.32 → 241.28] like an exposé because when you um design a device so many manufacturers are guilty of
[241.28 → 247.84] this when you design a device to basically ride its thermal throttling limit you are inherently
[247.84 → 253.20] introducing inconsistencies in the customer experience because if I'm someone who lives in
[253.92 → 261.68] Yukon or Alaska or something my experience with uh let's say a mobile phone for example for many months
[261.68 → 268.80] out of the year might be one of higher performance and yet lower battery compared to someone who lives in
[268.80 → 275.76] Arizona, or you know somewhere along the equator, and so i had actually it was just such an ambitious
[275.76 → 280.96] project that i never got around to doing it but what i had wanted to do was take like a half
[280.96 → 286.32] a dozen phones were what i was really focused on at the time uh, but you could do it just as easily
[286.32 → 293.44] with laptops or desktops for that matter take half a dozen devices and then like benchmark them in real
[293.44 → 297.76] world conditions because obviously you could just buy a thermal chamber or whatever, and you know
[297.76 → 301.84] adjust the humidity on your chamber, and you could simulate it that way manufacturers
[301.84 → 308.24] do that obviously but the idea of like travelling around the world and seeing you know uh one of the
[308.24 → 313.76] things i wanted to investigate was whether different regional versions of a skew might actually even be
[313.76 → 319.44] tuned differently because I've heard of things like that like the Taiwanese version of some phone
[319.44 → 326.48] being uh more optimized to deal with high humidity for example but I've never seen like concrete proof
[326.48 → 332.80] that that's like an industry-wide thing that happens at any appreciable scale so it was I had an idea
[332.80 → 337.68] that's like sort of related to that but the idea of going down there and making it like a land party
[337.68 → 346.08] or like a like a competition type thing that's pretty cool i i like the idea because like
[346.08 → 354.32] like if you do like if you do separate teams and each team can bring their own rig maybe it has to
[354.32 → 358.16] hit certain specifications, or you have a certain budget i don't know, but each team can bring their
[358.16 → 364.16] own rig and their own like countermeasures you could maybe go with like a fixed case, or you have
[364.16 → 369.12] to use a tent test bench or something, and you can't do a covering so you can't get away from the sun
[369.12 → 373.52] yeah that was something Austin brought up, and it's a very good point that like shade would just be super
[373.52 → 379.84] imbalanced, so yeah can't allow shade and your parts have to be exposed or whatever yeah there
[379.84 → 383.76] can't be any cheating in that way but how however you decide to do your cooling blah blah blah could
[383.76 → 389.84] be really, really cool, and then you just brought up another thing i don't know how the competition
[389.84 → 393.84] would tie into this, but you could take the same rigs and the same parts or whatever and go to Alaska
[394.40 → 400.88] yeah totally be like all sub-zero to you know 50 degrees above zero or whatever like the
[400.88 → 408.08] temperature delta of those systems would be just obscene i know right like how fast
[408.08 → 415.52] does a RTX 3080 go in Death Valley you know yeah yeah that'd be really cool and like you could you
[415.52 → 419.12] could centre the trip around that, but you could do other things while you're there too you could take
[419.12 → 426.88] like macBooks that notoriously thermal throttle nick lights messaging me he's like lttstore.com sun hats
[426.88 → 432.00] highlander edition thanks nick that was a hundred percent worth pinging the entire thousands of
[432.00 → 438.64] people watching with a team's notification thank you for that thank you for that nick light uh crustier
[438.64 → 445.44] has a PSA for me in the YouTube chat it's 2020 Linus stop calling things dank um this lower third
[445.44 → 455.04] like banner thing that you're looking at is quite literally four years old so uh that's that's why that's
[455.04 → 460.64] why hasn't been updated uh pretty dank super chat dude thanks for uh yeah, thanks for calling
[460.64 → 465.20] in it was a super chat actually i just uh i just thought it was I thought it was very funny i thought
[465.20 → 469.84] it was very well it would have been more dank if it was a super chat yeah yeah come on apparently dank
[469.84 → 475.52] is still dank according to avalanche master that's a great username um all right so why don't we jump
[475.52 → 481.04] into our first topic here NVIDIA's bonked ampere launch you guys clicked on this you want to know you
[481.04 → 488.16] want to punch that you guys want to know how NVIDIA has disappointed gamers well it sure as
[488.16 → 493.76] heck isn't with their performance and it sure as heck isn't with their pricing gamers are pretty into
[493.76 → 501.60] that right about now well on the 3080 in particular where they're disappointing people is actually getting
[501.60 → 508.96] any 3080s in the hands of these non-disappointed gamers are not crash once you get them and having
[508.96 → 514.88] them not crash, so this is kind of like three news stories in one, but the 3000 series launch has been
[514.88 → 522.40] fraught with issues first low availability thanks to scalper bots and now so much more RTX 3080s have
[522.40 → 529.76] been reportedly shipping from new egg in what is called OEM packaging so in other words the bear card
[529.76 → 537.84] wrapped in bubble wrap and then thrown into a shipping box just a loose box yeah so OEM packaging is
[537.84 → 545.12] pretty common for things like um way okay back in the day way back in the day um when ace tech first
[545.12 → 552.32] launched the LCC, so the first closed loop like all-in-one cooler the only way to get it uh brands
[552.32 → 557.92] like corsair hadn't launched their rebranded or derivative products yet so the only way to get it
[557.92 → 563.44] because i saw it and i was like big water cooling nerd i was like wow we could like water cool all our
[563.44 → 569.68] pre-built systems this would be sick we're going to be we're going to be the next big thing um so
[569.68 → 577.84] the only way to get it was to contact ace tech order a container of them um, and they would all just come
[577.84 → 584.24] in well OEM packaging which means it's designed for an OEM and an OEM in this context means someone
[584.24 → 590.64] who plans to add their own retail packaging solution their own instructions their own accessories and
[590.64 → 597.52] decals and whatever the case may be so silly me uh without really giving any thought to how it was
[597.52 → 605.76] actually going to get done i ordered this entire gigantic thing of these ace tech LC LCS realized that
[605.76 → 610.64] because no one really like knew about them, they weren't gonna just order systems with them in it
[610.64 → 619.44] and also our system volume wasn't really that high and so um i ended up actually cutting up the OEM
[619.44 → 626.24] packaging which was like multiple LC LCS per box with like foam i ended up cutting a lot of the OEM
[626.24 → 631.36] packaging like cutting the foam and then i sourced boxes and then i had to like to put it in there and
[631.36 → 637.44] like salvage other foam and like make my own packaging for these LC LCS that we ended up spending
[637.44 → 644.64] like the next very long time uh selling we did eventually we did get rid of them we didn't lose money
[644.64 → 649.60] but there was some sweat blood and tears of mine that went into making that a sort of successful
[649.60 → 653.92] launch, and it was only sort of successful because by the time corsair launched the h50
[654.48 → 660.72] uh did they call it yeah i think they called the h50 um with like the same price, and you know way
[660.72 → 666.96] better instructions and stuff uh yeah it sort of looked like a looked like a bad call looking kind of
[666.96 → 673.44] a bad call anyway the point is um someone over at new egg is having a similar experience they got some OEM cards
[673.44 → 678.32] up in here uh there's a there's a bubble wrapped bubble wrap can you imagine getting something like
[678.88 → 685.44] a RTX 3080 skip to the next picture the next one like in the dock or no in the Reddit thread
[685.44 → 691.36] there should be an arrow to the right oh wow i don't even i don't even read it Luke you know that i never
[691.36 → 699.28] read it did you uh the like Io plate is bent oh that's rough there you go it should still work
[699.28 → 705.52] actually it should but still like that's not what you want to show up when you buy a super premium
[705.52 → 712.64] product like that 700 graphics card that's not you dropped money on that it shows up with no box
[712.64 → 718.72] no like and i can bet this guy's not going to read the instruction manual but like it doesn't have it
[718.72 → 723.60] so it doesn't feel like the premium experience that you just paid for, and it's like literally damaged
[723.60 → 728.72] even if it does work it's literally damaged yeah it's just lame he might have already flipped his
[728.72 → 734.72] previous card in order to afford this purchase now he might have to i don't know RMA this or something
[734.72 → 740.56] in order to get one that's like not partially worked Jacob from VGA gave an assessment on the
[740.56 → 746.24] NVIDIA Subreddit saying that a very, very small number of cards look to have been shipped from new
[746.24 → 751.12] egg in bulk i wonder what the point of new egg having any bulk graphics cards is though like
[751.12 → 755.76] they did away with their system integrator ages ago they used to abs i think it was called
[756.40 → 760.96] um, but they don't have one anymore like the only reason i can think of to ship cards in bulk like
[760.96 → 768.32] that is to a is who's going to essentially package it into a complete system like i what are they even
[768.32 → 773.76] doing does new egg do their own builds guys let me know if I'm just totally off base on this
[773.76 → 783.76] let me go take a look i mean i I'm fairly sure that new egg abs systems I'm fairly sure that's dead
[784.32 → 790.48] abs gaming desktop oh whoa hey hold on a second doesn't look good it doesn't have his own website
[790.48 → 797.04] anymore, but it looks like abs uh is a thing still being sold through new egg yeah how about that
[797.04 → 803.76] all right well it shows you what i know they tried to stop it, but the abs kicked in
[805.12 → 811.68] oh wait no, no hold on no that would just stop it faster darn it okay uh wait how can I salvage this
[812.32 → 818.48] nope i think we're done here um so Anthony put a note on the dock that says I'm not sure who at the
[818.48 → 823.52] warehouse would have thought it was appropriate to ship a card loose like that yeah let me fill you in a
[823.52 → 828.72] little something Anthony I'm generalizing a little bit here and i there's a lot of people
[829.44 → 835.60] there's a lot of people in this especially this climate that are probably brilliant people
[835.60 → 840.96] who care a lot and are stuck in a dead-end job in a warehouse, but there's also a lot of people
[840.96 → 847.36] working in a warehouse because quite frankly they don't have either the cares or the mental fortitude
[847.36 → 854.08] to do pretty much anything else um i remember watching someone off of at least four rungs up
[854.08 → 863.20] an a-frame ladder grab a box an entire master carton of optical drives and toss it down onto the concrete
[863.20 → 869.20] floor instead of carrying it down i saw that happen and i was like
[869.20 → 878.24] like what are you doing like someone said in the chat minimum wage minimum effort and like
[879.60 → 886.48] yeah it's not there's also people if you want to rise up yeah like i think that that type of approach
[886.48 → 893.28] is taken a lot and like having worked those types of jobs as i think most of us have uh you definitely
[893.28 → 900.96] see a lot of it and like not my problem is another big one that's going to be pushed so like if they're
[900.96 → 905.76] told to ship this thing, and it comes down the line it doesn't have a box i suspect a lot of the approach
[905.76 → 912.48] is going to be like well i got to fill my orders yep well part of the okay so i agree with you that
[912.48 → 918.88] in condemning minimum wage minimum effort absolutely because a lot of what we look for in people is
[918.88 → 925.68] very strong passion for what they're doing, and we love rewarding that absolutely love it the problem
[925.68 → 932.88] though is that not every company has that attitude and so aside from like so so so yes 100 condemn
[932.88 → 939.92] minimum wage minimum effort, but that's a systemic problem where people are basically reduced to the
[939.92 → 946.96] quota that they're supposed to fill, and essentially you know treated like okay like you can't expect
[946.96 → 953.28] an employee to view the relationship as anything other than transactional right like you can't expect
[953.28 → 958.32] them to see anything other than the paycheck if you don't see anything other than the number of widgets
[958.32 → 964.40] they stuff in a box and kick out the door that's your problem yeah there's no relationship so you can't
[964.40 → 969.68] be like look you need to you need to value the company and care about the company and care about the
[969.68 → 975.76] customer now i don't give an about the customer like what's the customer ever done for me the customer
[975.76 → 984.48] pays you they don't pay me so i can see where this attitude can come from if you are creating
[984.48 → 990.56] a culture like a work culture of only valuing output and the problem is like i see it from both sides
[990.56 → 1000.40] i really do like i worked at a volume business e-tail organization for years and now I'm on the other
[1000.40 → 1008.00] side of it working as the boss of an organization of three dozen plus people, and you know from my
[1008.00 → 1016.88] perspective the only thing you guys got to understand this the only thing that pays our bills and pays our
[1016.88 → 1027.68] staff's paychecks is views that's it at the end of the day everything else is derived from views so
[1027.68 → 1036.72] where do views come from videos so we have quotas like we have targets you guys ever noticed
[1036.72 → 1042.72] that Linus tech tips uploads a video every day come hell or high water you ever notice tech wiki uploads
[1042.72 → 1048.48] a video once every two to four days or excuse me three to four days two videos per week come hell or
[1048.48 → 1053.52] high water you know his tech link goes up every Monday Wednesday and Friday regardless of whether it's a
[1053.52 → 1058.16] vacation day or whatever the case may be to be clear those people do get the time off just not
[1058.16 → 1064.56] on that day we schedule around it the point is that in an accident you have to have quotas
[1065.44 → 1072.64] you just also have to make sure that people see the value of their work and the value of themselves
[1072.64 → 1077.68] in ways that aren't just money, or it's always going to be purely transactional, and you can expect
[1077.68 → 1084.40] to get out exactly what you put in um and from the flip side you know as long as you're putting in
[1084.40 → 1089.68] exactly what you feel like you're being paid for me, i as an employer will never give you more
[1090.80 → 1094.48] with that said a lot of employers will never give you more regardless so i can see where a lot of that
[1094.48 → 1099.92] jaded attitude absolutely comes from 100 and the funny thing is especially when you've been working
[1099.92 → 1103.52] that job for like an obscenely long amount of time or something because i know like yeah from my
[1103.52 → 1111.44] experience what i would say is like i got a lot of opportunities and a lot of jobs and stuff very
[1111.44 → 1116.56] early on like especially when i was working at like Best Buy and stuff I'm talking like real early on
[1116.56 → 1124.00] yeah um by like pushing really hard to try to do well um i had customers try to hire me on the spot
[1124.88 → 1130.88] like i like there was like because usually people in those positions just don't care yeah so if you try to
[1130.88 → 1136.56] show that you do care your fellow employees years down the line might be in a position where
[1136.56 → 1139.84] they need someone, and they might remember you and they might want to bring you up that's not always
[1139.84 → 1144.16] going to be the situation you might be in a situation where there isn't a single person you work with
[1144.16 → 1149.04] that you would ever want to call you up down the line yep etc, and you might be stuck in a dead-end
[1149.04 → 1154.56] job forever where your boss doesn't care etc I've got an example of that um so the guy who does the
[1154.56 → 1163.76] fulfillment for lttstore.com lttstore.com is actually one of the old warehouse guys from NCI
[1164.40 → 1170.56] so he broke off he started up his own thing, and he just like reached out randomly he's like hey bro
[1170.56 → 1175.28] just letting you know like I'm doing this got no idea if this is relevant at the time it wasn't and i was
[1175.28 → 1182.08] like sweet dude i remember working with you, you're sweet you're awesome and then all of a sudden we like
[1182.08 → 1186.96] like i think we like to cut it off with tee spring or something like that because something made me mad
[1186.96 → 1194.08] or something and um i was like hey we know what we're just going to take everything in-house
[1194.08 → 1199.28] and i don't mean in-house directly in our house, but we're gonna we're going to take control over
[1199.28 → 1204.96] you know how we handle our merch and uh we called them up, and we basically figured out if we could
[1204.96 → 1210.64] integrate Shopify with their system, and we could and all of a sudden you know they are shipping
[1210.64 → 1216.88] thousands of packages a month for us, and it's like that is not insignificant amounts of money
[1216.88 → 1225.04] anymore so he turned a positive impression with a former co-worker into it's a thing man a revenue
[1225.04 → 1234.72] stream yeah so never underestimate the power of networking basically is sort of one of the lessons
[1234.72 → 1239.52] here another thing i would say as i don't know why we're on this topic for so long but another thing
[1239.52 → 1251.92] i would say having uh done this myself is like until you're a boss there's going to be a lot of things
[1251.92 → 1258.56] that you do that you think are like clever or fine or whatever, and then you end up figuring out down the
[1258.56 → 1266.32] line that you're just a super douche Linus is just smiling who are you talking about Luke me I'm talking
[1266.32 → 1273.36] with me 100 I've done so much stuff that like oh my god i don't know how you still talk to me at all
[1273.36 → 1280.00] i there are things that like I'll be like trying to fall asleep and i know this is like a meme, but you're
[1280.00 → 1282.96] like trying to fall asleep and then your brain's just like hey remember that thing you did you're just
[1282.96 → 1291.36] like oh god there are so many of those things try to reduce those things you know for your own sake and
[1291.36 → 1298.96] whoever is your current boss because oh my god i was having i was having like uh i don't
[1298.96 → 1305.84] remember why i was like reflecting on you know my past you know my life uh a little while back but
[1305.84 → 1316.08] i there's this person in high school that i was always just mean to for no reason whatsoever i
[1316.08 → 1322.40] i was just i think the thing that made me think of it this particular time was I read a tweet
[1323.20 → 1328.64] that i don't know how credible it was or whatever but i read a tweet from someone who claims to know
[1328.64 → 1336.00] someone who claims to have gone to high school with me and that i was a douche and i thought you
[1336.00 → 1340.40] know what there's a lot of people who wouldn't have agreed with that sentiment and there's even more
[1340.40 → 1348.80] people who would have been like minus whom um i was not i was not popular or anything um, but there was
[1348.80 → 1354.40] like at least a couple of people who i was like yeah i would have absolutely deserved that description
[1354.40 → 1359.44] and what i decided to do was because it was something that had come up with me um
[1361.44 → 1366.96] like that i had thought of a lot of times i was like it has been 15 years but I'm going to look them up on
[1366.96 → 1374.96] Facebook and I'm going to be like hey sorry about that, and it was actually one of the most like i
[1374.96 → 1379.84] realize it's like kind of selfish of me to even think about it this way to think about it in terms
[1379.84 → 1387.60] of like how much it helped me because obviously it wasn't about me but i felt so much better like it was
[1387.60 → 1394.00] it was crazy this is someone i haven't seen in 15 years had really no relationship to speak of with them
[1394.00 → 1400.48] um even when i did know them because like obviously we didn't hang out um but i was just like hey i
[1400.48 → 1407.68] don't even know if you remember me but if you do, it's probably not great and I'm really sorry and they
[1407.68 → 1417.12] were like yeah i remember you and no it wasn't and uh, but she was like it's okay you know we were all
[1417.12 → 1424.64] we were all dumb kids and uh i forgive you and i was like wow you are super cool and if you were
[1424.64 → 1432.40] always that cool than i feel even worse um i don't know if she was always that cool but i think
[1432.40 → 1437.36] one of the biggest things for me growing up like my tastes haven't changed much the things i like
[1437.36 → 1442.24] doing for fun haven't changed much yeah all that kind of stuff i think I'm young at heart in a lot of
[1442.24 → 1447.44] ways but i think probably the main one is that i like consider the actual ramifications and the
[1447.44 → 1455.84] actual impact on other people of my actions more because i think i didn't do that very much in the
[1455.84 → 1463.92] past you're a boundary pusher which is i think why i have such a soft spot for you, i i i recognize it
[1463.92 → 1473.76] and i have a lot of patience for it because i see my own path in it um, and you know i like to think
[1473.76 → 1482.56] that at some point you know everyone kind of wakes up and goes hey you know when the point of you know
[1482.56 → 1488.64] making a request for example hey can I expense this pack of gummy bears or whatever it is the
[1488.64 → 1494.56] point is not whether the other person will say yes or no the point is whether i should ask in the
[1494.56 → 1502.88] first place yeah and like you know that can have such an impact on a relationship and you won't
[1502.88 → 1508.16] necessarily know a lot of the time and stuff too yeah no and no you don't know and a lot of not
[1508.16 → 1512.72] knowing is just not thinking about it yeah um and the gummy bear example i don't think was actually
[1512.72 → 1517.68] Luke by the way that was someone else they know who they are um did you ever try and expense
[1517.68 → 1525.76] candy i never intentionally did I think a receipt might have gone through at one point yeah uh anyway
[1525.76 → 1531.92] the point is like you know we we we've all we were a very small company at the time and so it was like
[1532.72 → 1538.48] we tried to kind of focus on essentials like i would never buy bottled water at an airport you know
[1538.48 → 1543.84] like i would make sure i carry a water bottle so i can fill it at the water fountain and carry it onto
[1543.84 → 1548.40] the plane and like so you know i tried to have an i used to have a camel pack and i would like
[1549.12 → 1553.28] steal water anywhere i could that i knew was like fresh and good and fill my camel pack so i wouldn't
[1553.28 → 1560.00] have to buy bottles anyway like at CES and stuff yeah yeah 100 um so like i tried to lead by example
[1560.00 → 1565.84] so for me part of it was just like this is like it would disappoint me when people kind of didn't get it
[1565.84 → 1571.60] um i did see i did see a comment in the chat Linus was a bully lol
[1573.36 → 1579.84] i never really had the kind of clout or influence to be a bully i would probably describe it more as
[1579.84 → 1587.36] small dog syndrome like i was always kind of underfoot, and so i would lash out at people
[1588.40 → 1594.56] um who i wouldn't even describe them as like lower down the totem pole than me even like it was just
[1594.56 → 1599.36] i guess i would lash out at people sometimes who i didn't think would fight back like i was not
[1599.36 → 1606.72] always very nice and that is definitely the textbook case of a bully but i wasn't by any stretch like a
[1607.36 → 1614.24] like a career bully i mostly just minded my own business um there were just some mistakes that
[1614.24 → 1624.16] i absolutely made uh very very very poor poor poor judgment um and yeah it was just it was lame and
[1624.72 → 1629.60] i feel better now we had some small talk you know she's got kids now i got kids got that common
[1629.60 → 1635.04] ground um you know we're not going to be besties or anything obviously, but it was definitely
[1635.04 → 1642.32] it was definitely helpful yeah i just hope like you know and like as a parent i just hope my kids don't
[1642.32 → 1646.80] have to do that, but they will, they'll probably be i was going to say i think they make mistakes a lot of
[1646.80 → 1653.84] it's part of just like growing up and staking out your territory and stuff like yeah, and you can't
[1653.84 → 1660.48] like understand properly that that's like really not a way to treat people until you've done that
[1661.20 → 1667.28] if that makes sense like i was never a bully i don't think there's a single person from my school
[1667.28 → 1672.96] that would call me a bully but i was also huge compared to other people and never really understood
[1672.96 → 1678.72] that very well so every once in a while i would like to do something thinking it was like funny and
[1678.72 → 1683.44] then someone would get like hurt and I'd be like holy i didn't mean to do that I'm sorry
[1685.28 → 1690.08] yeah there was only one time that you really scared me that i can think of i don't know maybe
[1690.08 → 1695.28] there's more than once but there was definitely one time you really scared the pants off me
[1695.28 → 1701.92] what i don't forget what i did I don't forget what i did something to you whether it was like
[1702.64 → 1706.88] spraying you in the face with a water gun or something, but it was in the back alley behind
[1706.88 → 1714.48] the old house that we used to work out of and i got it in my head that my start to get away from
[1714.48 → 1719.76] you because i had a pretty good head start my start to get away was I was going to scale the fence
[1719.76 → 1726.64] which i thought you'd probably have more difficulty than me getting over and then i would be able to
[1726.64 → 1732.80] go hide that was pretty much my thought process so i did something to you and i booked it and you
[1732.80 → 1739.92] caught up to me so fast and were i think you pulled me down off the fence or something like that and i was
[1739.92 → 1748.08] like huh so if i ever actually crossed this guy he would not only take down my website delete my YouTube
[1748.08 → 1757.04] channel he could probably also kill me pretty quickly that's good to know i think more CEOs
[1757.04 → 1761.44] should work shoulder to shoulder with their staff who are much bigger than them, it might give them
[1761.44 → 1767.28] less of a god complex okay yeah I'm like usually the big guy in the room, and then we have a meetup
[1767.28 → 1772.08] and i figure out that not one, but two of my employees are bigger than i like Jaden's taller than
[1772.08 → 1777.84] me and then Jonathan is actually a giant Jaden's a stick though no offence Jaden
[1778.08 → 1785.84] i think you could take him poor Jaden all right we should uh we should continue
[1785.84 → 1791.44] talking about NVIDIA's NVIDIA's disappointment here all right so if that weren't enough NVIDIA's store
[1791.44 → 1796.88] website has been found leaking personal information upon realizing this NVIDIA closed the store page in
[1796.88 → 1804.80] question while they tried to figure out what's going on oof then making matters worse third-party RTX 3080s
[1804.80 → 1813.76] from the likes of um MSI total and VGA have been apparently users of our own forum have been
[1813.76 → 1820.96] experiencing crashes no not the Linus techtips.com users wow this is like a five-page thread and stuff
[1820.96 → 1829.36] dang okay um, so the issue appears to show up in certain groups of games when the boost clock exceeds
[1829.36 → 1834.40] two gigahertz early observations show that once clocks reach a certain speed the game crashes to
[1834.40 → 1841.12] desktop like clockwork ha ha ha got them there's currently no official statement from any board
[1841.12 → 1845.68] partner but computer base has confirmed that they are in contact with the manufacturers and have been
[1845.68 → 1850.32] unable to reproduce the issue themselves it's not clear why it's happening with speculation around
[1850.32 → 1855.44] power supplies software or driver bugs or even aggressive factory overclocks from board partners
[1855.44 → 1859.60] trying to compete with founders edition now I'm actually kind of tempted where's my where the
[1859.60 → 1864.40] crap is my phone I'm kind of tempted to give Anthony a call because he was actually having some crashing
[1864.40 → 1872.40] issues with our first 3080 and i think that he is was either just that game never got working or he
[1872.40 → 1879.44] might have actually resolved it by uh switching power supplies even though theoretically the power supply we
[1879.44 → 1884.96] had had had ample capacity for the RTX 3080 let me just get him on the line while i run through
[1886.24 → 1892.24] a couple more notes here so Igor's lab said it's plausibly a result of power filtering design variation
[1892.24 → 1898.00] for the GPUs die hey Anthony you're on wan show uh is that cool are you like off work right now or what
[1898.88 → 1905.12] i mean I'm in the car, but it's okay, okay he's in the car so uh all right that's good um sorry, sorry i had
[1905.12 → 1908.88] to get that in their let me just turn up the oh sorry I'm bumping the mic let me turn up the volume a
[1908.88 → 1912.80] little bit so i don't have to have you quite so close to the mic okay so hey Anthony did we ever
[1912.80 → 1918.56] figure out why our uh 3080 founders was crashing at first uh when you were working on the review
[1920.72 → 1925.28] uh I'm trying to think now it was a rough week for him
[1927.52 → 1938.24] a rough couple of weeks i mean NVIDIA back to back yeah anyway um i think it was the memory speed on the CPU
[1938.24 → 1944.16] okay so it was causing the problem so not probably related to the crashing to desktop that
[1944.16 → 1951.68] people are seeing probably not though we did have that uh power supply thing with the 850 watt yeah
[1951.68 → 1958.80] where theoretically 850 watts is lots especially for a 3080 and yet here we are yeah apparently it's
[1958.80 → 1963.52] something to do with the transient response and the power supply uh overcurrent protection tripping
[1964.24 → 1968.72] yada et cetera got it all right cool thanks Anthony appreciate you
[1969.92 → 1971.60] take care later
[1974.48 → 1981.36] um all right so blah blah blah so monolithic conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors are
[1981.36 → 1984.72] being used more often on the boards that have been implicated which is interesting
[1984.72 → 1992.88] so, so far crash free are Asus and NVIDIA's founders editions, and they use groups of smaller
[1992.88 → 1999.76] multi-layer ceramic chip capacitors or a mix of both Igor's lab indicates that MCC offer better
[1999.76 → 2006.48] filtering so users on Reddit are of course compiling lists of cards with MCC groups versus Oscars
[2007.12 → 2012.56] but that probably doesn't tell the whole story j from j's two cents he's no okay guy i guess reported
[2012.56 → 2018.08] that electronics engineers on Reddit are cautioning against oversimplifying the problem here each type
[2018.08 → 2022.56] of capacitor has their pros and cons and the only inherent difference between the two um that might
[2022.56 → 2029.60] be relevant at the moment is that Oscars perform worse at high frequencies and cards that use Oscars
[2029.60 → 2033.68] could have other filtering down the line before they get to the GPU to compensate anyway so it's a
[2033.68 → 2040.40] developing story if you've got one that crashes um don't like or no so if you've got one don't check
[2040.40 → 2046.80] your GPU and get mad you've got Oscars it could be fine, but that's not the only third-party problem
[2046.80 → 2051.84] either some board partners have also been accused of selling slower cards at the same price as founders
[2051.84 → 2058.96] editions in order to differentiate their higher-end skews that they can sell for more womb womb womb
[2058.96 → 2079.60] womb womb womb womb womb womb
[2079.84 → 2083.68] home yeah
[2083.68 → 2089.54] by the way there's been some comments about this i am sure he was on a hands-free device probably a
[2089.54 → 2093.94] like answer call through your steering wheel thing I'm sure he wasn't holding his phone
[2093.94 → 2099.74] to his head oh anthony gets arrived for his so oh there you go passenger seat yeah so
[2099.74 → 2103.52] there 's's no way he was driving i like actually know that for a fact
[2103.52 → 2109.20] you know far too much about uh about a lot like it's funny you like
[2109.20 → 2117.02] i had like dinner with like Pella's parents at one point like it's like weird because especially
[2117.02 → 2121.54] in our business of making videos that a lot of the time are about telling personal stories
[2121.54 → 2128.38] we end up telling the personal stories of my staff because eventually i run out of personal stories
[2128.38 → 2137.78] about me um so we were making a video about uh whether a tinfoil hat would actually like block
[2137.78 → 2147.30] your brain waves oh yeah and as it happens Pella's mom is something of an enthusiast when it comes to
[2147.30 → 2154.98] that stuff so we drove over to the island and she had like all this gear for like measuring it like RF
[2154.98 → 2160.40] like ambient RF and like all this kind of stuff and i was like wow this is crazy this is great
[2160.40 → 2168.46] um sorry what were you going to say uh I've had dinner with Jaden his mom see it just kind of happens
[2168.46 → 2173.48] right i think smaller companies you just kind of you become yeah you're a little bit more
[2173.48 → 2180.14] entwined i kind of miss it sometimes you know like we're at the point now where we're big enough that
[2180.14 → 2185.96] the only reason that i know anything about like one of our new editors Nicole is because I've been
[2185.96 → 2190.28] desperate for a ride home a couple of times and she happens to go my way and like it's the funny
[2190.28 → 2197.10] because like i don't have like the close relationship with her that I'd feel like i could just be like
[2197.10 → 2202.72] hey yo i need a ride like if it was you and it's like 20 minutes out of your way I'd just be like
[2202.72 → 2212.42] you know it like let's go bro um whereas that's someone that like is kind of relatively new here
[2212.42 → 2219.92] and i always feel like as CEO um i need to be so careful what i ask people what i ask of people
[2219.92 → 2226.44] because if i ask them to do me a personal favour and they feel like their professional position
[2226.44 → 2233.82] working under me makes it so they can't say no i could accidentally cause someone to like
[2233.82 → 2239.46] you know miss an important family event or something because i just like needed a ride when it honestly
[2239.46 → 2243.20] wasn't that urgent because i could have just borrowed the work truck i just didn't want to
[2243.20 → 2247.88] drive in separately the next morning so it would be nice if i could get a ride like you know what i
[2247.88 → 2254.20] mean like i don't want to put people in a position where they feel you know burdened but then the flip
[2254.20 → 2259.06] side of it is without those personal interactions just like you know driving in the car together you're
[2259.06 → 2264.40] never going to get to know the person so how do you fix that when the company gets bigger and bigger
[2264.40 → 2269.12] i don't know sorry this is like very off-topic it's just sort of related to what we were
[2269.12 → 2274.52] talking about earlier i have no idea i don't have the viewer like chart open right now i have no idea
[2274.52 → 2278.30] if people find this interesting apparently they do so there you go we're going to stay the course boys
[2278.30 → 2285.72] um but yeah i just don't really have a solution to that like Luke and i worked shoulder to shoulder
[2285.72 → 2293.62] hip to hip for wow over a long time yeah like a couple of years before i was ever even his
[2293.62 → 2299.94] boss formally like i was like sort of his boss but also like we both worked for the man at that time
[2299.94 → 2308.14] so there's already this like camaraderie that that exists um whereas the bigger we get, the more
[2308.14 → 2313.42] separated i am from everything like i don't even i don't even interview people any more people
[2313.42 → 2317.94] literally start their first day at Linus media group now and i have never exchanged a word with them
[2317.94 → 2322.96] and so it's like kind of awkward a little bit because I'm not used to it
[2322.96 → 2329.98] yeah for sure i would be very not used to that as well, and it's going to be weird like
[2329.98 → 2334.44] yeah i don't know like you haven't been in the office for six months
[2334.44 → 2341.64] it would be you wouldn't recognize me yeah yeah it would be extremely foreign like have you even I'm
[2341.64 → 2346.00] assuming people have moved and stuff too like desk locations like oh yeah everyone's all over the place
[2346.00 → 2351.70] like yeah so it would be very weird have you even met Nicole i don't think no i don't think okay do
[2351.70 → 2353.34] you remember Hoffman from his first stint
[2353.34 → 2362.34] yeah okay yeah all right he's okay yeah it doesn't matter the point is that the RTX 3090
[2362.34 → 2370.00] launch reviews ended up being pretty underwhelming to many with performance high but not in line with
[2370.00 → 2376.78] the extra cost and there are a bunch of other notes here but can I start by saying was anybody surprised
[2376.78 → 2384.76] by this like maybe yeah maybe I've just gotten jaded maybe that's why i didn't you know
[2384.76 → 2391.66] ream on this enough in our review because what you all what you guys see when you see a GPU review
[2391.66 → 2399.68] is you see Anthony's testing and his script after he and i have spent in some cases as little as 20
[2399.68 → 2408.84] minutes and in other cases as much as a couple of hours going through and adjusting it and analyzing
[2408.84 → 2416.86] and discussing and changing the flow and and and editing it that's what you guys see and between the
[2416.86 → 2424.50] two of us neither of us again maybe we're just so cynical now that we're just like well yeah of course
[2424.50 → 2429.84] the top tier one costs some ungodly amount of money that nobody can afford maybe we're just so jaded
[2429.84 → 2435.96] so cynical that we just didn't even think to complain about it because what were you expecting
[2435.96 → 2445.98] and video was very clear that RTX 3080 is the top of the line and RTX 3090 is this because we can
[2445.98 → 2455.34] product like look at the thing it's only 20 faster and yet draws up to 500 watts at peak they are
[2455.34 → 2463.08] clearly absolutely pushing the limit of their engineering just because they can who was expecting
[2463.08 → 2473.16] it to be bang for the buck who where are you standing up so i can slap you like what did you think
[2473.16 → 2483.86] was going to happen Luke were you expecting the 3090 to be a great value uh i was highly concerned
[2483.86 → 2492.46] about the card in general i guess because i and they kind of did it again but i had remembered
[2492.46 → 2496.64] when they were talking about performance numbers, and they're being very vague with them, and they were
[2496.64 → 2501.82] actually talking about specifically the VR performance numbers, but they didn't really
[2501.82 → 2507.22] disclose that this time around they didn't disclose that super clearly yeah and this time around they
[2507.22 → 2512.98] did the same thing, and it was like yeah okay cool and i tried to call that out and people were like no
[2512.98 → 2520.48] dude no there's no way okay this is great this is great half empty mug says they marketed a workstation
[2520.48 → 2531.26] card to gamers do you remember the 690 do you remember the 690 remember okay so 690 690 is really
[2531.26 → 2539.44] funny because NVIDIA explicitly said in the keynote this is not a card for gamers and then and then do
[2539.44 → 2547.84] you know what they did they had banners on newegg.com okay that were like the ultimate card for gaming how
[2547.84 → 2555.38] dare they know what the cold hard truth is NVIDIA's marketing as far as i can tell is as much
[2555.38 → 2560.78] about what people want them to say as it is about what's actually relevant because the fact of the
[2560.78 → 2567.68] matter is the kind of customer i have talked i have spoken not just spoken with i have got this is really
[2567.68 → 2573.88] funny i don't know if I've ever talked about this i have gone to the houses of these kinds of customers
[2573.88 → 2581.46] because that was I i i gave NCI way too much value for their money like thinking back to it, i had a customer
[2581.46 → 2585.60] that bought one of our very, very high-end water-cooled systems, and he had some kind of problem with it
[2585.60 → 2591.70] and literally without the company even knowing i was doing with doing it which I'm sure is like a problem
[2591.70 → 2599.54] in some way or other i literally got in my car drove to his house fixed it and then like went home
[2599.54 → 2604.92] at the end of the day like i went in the evening and like fixed his computer and then went home
[2604.92 → 2618.08] um anyway i um where was I going with this shoot right, so the point is i have spoken to these customers
[2618.08 → 2625.26] so the kinds of people there 's's there's only one kind of person that buys a product like this
[2625.26 → 2632.46] there's the kind or there are two kinds of people there are the kinds that like just want the absolute best performance
[2632.46 → 2638.56] so someone who is really after every competitive edge where 20 different performance basically means
[2638.56 → 2647.62] 20 faster frame times sign me up I'll take it that's number one those are pretty rare those are pretty rare
[2647.62 → 2655.48] number two is the one is the same kind of person who shows up at the car dealership doesn't even ask
[2655.48 → 2660.32] what all the different packages are and is basically like i don't even want to talk about it unless it's
[2660.32 → 2666.52] a fully loaded model you know what i mean i want the one with all the features it doesn't it doesn't matter
[2666.52 → 2671.86] what those features are i don't know i might need it someday i don't want to have that stress in my life
[2671.86 → 2675.40] that maybe i missed out on some feature that i might have liked to use
[2675.40 → 2682.34] and i can afford to not have that stress take my money I'll pick it up in whenever I'll pick it up
[2682.34 → 2687.04] tomorrow because uh you'll have it ready because i just bought the fully loaded model and that's how i
[2687.04 → 2693.38] swagger that's the other kind and those are the kinds of people to whom you know the difference
[2693.38 → 2699.64] between a 700 graphics card and a 1500 graphics card is frankly not that much because think about it
[2699.64 → 2708.48] this way they already bought the thread ripper whatever two thousand dollar CPU and the 700
[2708.48 → 2715.30] motherboard and the thousand dollars worth of high speed memory and the 800 power supply they are
[2715.30 → 2720.44] already spending five grand on this system so let's do some real fun math here ladies and gentlemen
[2720.44 → 2726.94] let's do some real fun math if I'm already spending five thousand dollars what is another
[2726.94 → 2733.40] what does that what does that work out to 800 is that 50 1500 dollars for the uh for the 3090
[2733.40 → 2743.16] so 800 divided by five thousand dollars wow 16 so when you're already spending that kind of money
[2743.16 → 2753.08] well 16 for another 15 to 20 performance uplift it's a no-brainer it's just a completely different
[2753.08 → 2759.84] class of system that's the thing that people are trying to wrap their brains around and not really
[2759.84 → 2768.22] realizing i think is that for that customer it does make sense, and you can say it's still too expensive
[2768.22 → 2776.04] and that's fine which is why NVIDIA has more than one product go buy something else that's just the
[2776.04 → 2782.84] way that it is the yields on that card are definitely going to be lower the cost the R&D that went into
[2782.84 → 2787.80] creating that card in the first place given that it's going to be a lower volume model is going to be
[2787.80 → 2794.14] proportionally higher on a per-card basis and there's the fact that this is NVIDIA if they think they can
[2794.14 → 2802.66] charge more for it, they will what did you think was going to happen there that's my thought on it
[2802.66 → 2808.04] i will now look at my notes and see what i was supposed to say any thoughts Luke it seems like
[2808.04 → 2812.26] you've been working on something over there is there a crisis or a little bit no there's
[2812.26 → 2821.34] something cool oh okay oh plane chat has pop out now oh finally it was updated and it is now works
[2821.34 → 2826.68] you might have to refresh the page oh I'm excited okay cool all right now i can use that when I'm
[2826.68 → 2831.04] doing my VR streams i hope if i ever get them working again um all right so let me have a look
[2831.04 → 2835.10] at what i was supposed to say so workstation performance was crippled thanks to NVIDIA
[2835.10 → 2840.68] locking off titan driver optimizations on the 3090 directing users to buy a titan or squadron instead
[2840.68 → 2845.40] despite having introduced the card as titan class that was lame, and we called them out for that i didn't
[2845.40 → 2851.20] like that either uh this only compounded this is only compounded by the leaked 20 gig version of the
[2851.20 → 2859.26] RTX 3080 um uh which in our testing and by NVIDIA's only own admission is only 10 to 15 slower than the
[2859.26 → 2866.14] 3090 making that card's main advantage which is its 24 gigs of memory much less appealing for those who
[2866.14 → 2870.32] can wait a little while like we're planning to upgrade our workstations we were running into
[2870.32 → 2876.16] problems with our previous uh 2080 supers that's just running out of VRAM the editors are running out of
[2876.16 → 2883.28] video memory, and we actually had planned to go uh squadron p6000 so we were going to go because they
[2883.28 → 2887.12] have 24 gigs of ram which is what we found is a perfect sweet spot for some of the work that we
[2887.12 → 2893.98] do and that was going to be a pretty significant compute performance hit that's like two generations
[2893.98 → 2901.68] so hold on a second we got our Turing we got our pascal we got our uh Volta we got uh yeah so we're
[2901.68 → 2910.80] going all oh wait no that's Turing blood hill ampere Turing uh Volta and then all the way to pascal so
[2910.80 → 2919.26] that's four generations old at this point um but yeah if we could just go RTX 3080 that would be great
[2919.26 → 2923.54] that'd be freaking awesome we were planning to go 3090, but we might not have to
[2923.54 → 2930.00] uh in fact actually oh apparently we're just pivoting to we're talking about the leaked card so
[2930.00 → 2935.84] galaxy has leaked their own 20 gig variant along with RTX 3060 as shown in a photograph of a galaxy
[2935.84 → 2944.80] company meeting in China oh this is terrific here we go here we go ladies and gentlemen uh 30 90 30 80
[2944.80 → 2958.72] 20 gig 30 80 10 gig pg 142 SKU zero what is that 30 70 and 30 60 i am so jazzed for 30 70 and 30 60
[2958.72 → 2966.48] like look at this a 30 60 class card they're expecting to be in line with RTX 20 80 like what
[2966.48 → 2974.44] that's pretty fantastic yeah like that could be a like 399 like 349 even cards should i hope
[2974.44 → 2979.16] for 299 probably not it's probably not going to happen it's probably going to be i feel like they're trying
[2979.16 → 2984.24] to move away from that, but that would be very cool I'm going to guess I'm going to guess 349 um
[2984.24 → 2993.88] all right and so some people are mad because you know the high memory versions of those
[2993.88 → 2999.94] other cards would eat into the RTX 30 90s market position for all but 8k gaming which is only possible
[2999.94 → 3006.90] on a few optimized titles unless you use DSS 2.0 uh i mean the thing about the whole 8k gaming thing is
[3006.90 → 3017.60] like it's in the same it's along the same lines as something like RTX last time around where it's
[3017.60 → 3024.02] capable of it but yes you're asking for some stars to align in order to really have that experience
[3024.02 → 3032.64] personally i found it absolutely exciting from just a technological standpoint and yes doom
[3032.64 → 3037.68] eternal is an extraordinarily well optimized game, but that doesn't mean it's not a
[3037.68 → 3046.52] pretty one that gaming experience particularly doom eternal was unlike anything i have ever done and i
[3046.52 → 3055.10] have tried basically everything at this point so should we look at NVIDIA and say you guys are bad
[3055.10 → 3061.58] boys marketing this card as 8k gaming capable when what they have done is delivered a very powerful GPU
[3061.58 → 3067.68] with a ton of VRAM or should we turn to the game developers and say hey that game looks gorgeous
[3067.68 → 3075.38] and runs great at 8k why doesn't yours so it's a chicken-and-egg thing over the next few years we
[3075.38 → 3080.26] might see better optimization of games because we're going to be targeting higher fidelity levels and higher
[3080.26 → 3087.44] resolutions for these next gen consoles, and we might see you know speed bumps or like a next gen like an
[3087.44 → 3093.20] RTX 4000 series or whatever and 8k gaming 8k gaming might happen for real but for now i really don't
[3093.20 → 3098.54] think NVIDIA is actually expecting a ton of people to run out and buy the card for 8k gaming and go buy
[3098.54 → 3103.96] a 30 000 TV to go with it, i think for them, it was just a big flex because it's something no one else can
[3103.96 → 3110.96] do, and you know dang it if i was is i was Jensen and i wanted to make a big flex i think 8k gaming might
[3110.96 → 3117.94] be it i get it if you have a marble stove maybe you just gotta do some stuff yeah like i get it
[3117.94 → 3122.82] i get it i get why they did it and I'm not mad about it but i can see why people are mad about it
[3122.82 → 3128.16] because yeah it's like a big flex but all those people who are upset that they feel misled ask
[3128.16 → 3133.48] yourself this was it did it matter was it in any meaningful way were you going to buy one
[3133.48 → 3142.76] like i wouldn't even at my even at my peak of spending all of my disposable income on tech
[3142.76 → 3149.26] there was no way i would buy something like that the closest i ever got the closest i ever got was I
[3149.26 → 3158.06] bought two 7800 GTS because i found them on Craigslist for an unbelievable deal from some guy who
[3158.06 → 3163.92] was like I'm kind of like sick of SLI i want to like to try crossfire for a bit so he was literally
[3163.92 → 3170.92] upgrading from 27900 GTS to two x1950 its or something like that or cross grading it's not
[3170.92 → 3174.56] even an upgrade at that point yeah yeah, and he was getting rid of them for nothing because he just
[3174.56 → 3179.92] didn't feel like dealing with it, you can't give it away because then you get all the losers showing up
[3179.92 → 3184.94] and they like they're just unreasonable flaky people whenever you like post something for free
[3184.94 → 3189.46] so he posted it for cheap because that's when you get a serious buyer who's going to show up when
[3189.46 → 3197.52] they say they're going to show up, and they don't waste your time um so i show up i buy these and like
[3197.52 → 3205.26] i ran them for like two or three days that was it because i was so paranoid that some new leak was
[3205.26 → 3209.84] going to come out or some new product was going to come out that was going to devalue them or something
[3209.84 → 3214.84] maybe he knew something i didn't know and i needed to get rid of them because i had way too much
[3214.84 → 3222.46] money tied up in a part that was I was worried was going to depreciate so fast so yeah i uh on like
[3222.46 → 3228.44] to jump back a little bit in terms of like i wouldn't buy one of these personally i am very
[3228.44 → 3237.88] happy with my current 1440p monitor and feel exactly no need to upgrade at all um and like what is
[3237.88 → 3244.34] exciting about new cards is better frame rates at that resolution at better qualities uh because i find
[3244.34 → 3252.72] like some really high fidelity games maintaining a minimum at 144 at maximum quality is still really
[3252.72 → 3258.78] freaking tough yeah need a little more grunt so like yeah I'll take the extra power for sure but like
[3258.78 → 3266.30] i don't I don't know I'm not i don't need that that that memory buffer Mark Owen says yes it does
[3266.30 → 3275.78] matter what these companies do impacts the whole market not really this what buyers what customers buy
[3275.78 → 3283.96] impacts the market the reason RTX 3000 exists is that people didn't buy RTX 2000 that's why
[3283.96 → 3289.76] it's all about what the market will bear nothing else actually matters NVIDIA made a calculation that
[3289.76 → 3296.96] they were going to make this RTX 3090 card for millionaires and the maximum performance at any
[3296.96 → 3303.64] cost crowd, and you're mad because you were never the customer for it anyway and all the people who
[3303.64 → 3311.04] were the customer for it, they do not give a that's all there is to it, they're not mad they don't care
[3311.04 → 3319.02] because to them, they have always marketed these cards like titans come on yeah titans were always
[3319.02 → 3325.90] marketed 8800 ultra 8800 ultra it's like 12 years ago or whatever how many years ago is that holy
[3325.90 → 3336.42] this whole time they've been like it's not for gamers, but also it's not for gamers though unless you
[3336.42 → 3343.94] unless you have a 30 000 TV boys yeah that 30 000 TV I'm kind of tempted to do a review of it
[3343.94 → 3350.36] should I do a review of it because i got a lot to say actually it's its so ridiculous get this
[3350.36 → 3354.42] we actually did it get this you cannot wall mount it
[3354.42 → 3364.90] it's 30 000, and it has fewer features than a 300 TV i could get at Walmart you should just like troll them
[3364.90 → 3371.70] super hard and build a mount that comes over the wall, but you still sit it on it oh my god i actually
[3371.70 → 3378.10] kind of love it hexes it's like so patronizing it's not my fault you needed to explain to you
[3378.10 → 3381.02] I'm going to get cancelled aren't I
[3381.02 → 3388.72] oh my god we should totally mount it on the wall anyway the thing is so ridiculous because
[3388.72 → 3395.52] it's the kind of product that only exists as like an art piece because anyone who can afford a
[3395.52 → 3397.52] thirty thousand dollar television
[3397.52 → 3403.92] clearly doesn't ask how much it costs, and honestly they're not even buying it for the TV
[3403.92 → 3411.12] they might not even watch it they're probably too busy you know merging and taking over companies or
[3411.12 → 3415.72] doing whatever the crap else it is that they do i mean there's a lot of people with a lot of money that never do anything
[3415.72 → 3421.08] anything okay that's that's fair but they wouldn't necessarily buy this one because it's like
[3421.08 → 3427.16] as far as i can tell it's intended to be more of an art piece like you can't you can't mount it properly
[3427.16 → 3433.48] like that's ridiculous you know me the the the pragmatic guy like i watch that TV is sitting in our
[3433.48 → 3438.52] studio i actually i think we're supposed to send it back to NVIDIA i actually don't know i actually
[3438.52 → 3443.48] don't know what the plan is for that TV nick arranged the whole thing but i didn't even
[3443.48 → 3449.88] ask if i could take it home where the heck would I put if it's 88 inches, and it doesn't wall mount
[3449.88 → 3456.20] it has to sit on the ground the stand's not even high enough to be at a comfortable viewing height
[3456.20 → 3463.56] like it's obviously just a flex no one's buying that for like the viewing experience like if
[3463.56 → 3469.80] you have if you have that kind of money, and you are actually an enthusiast you're actually an
[3469.80 → 3477.00] enthusiast you're pulling in anon from 10 15 years ago, and you are building like a room like a home
[3477.00 → 3483.08] theatre room, and you are either going very high-end projector or more realistically these days you're
[3483.08 → 3490.20] going with something like a Samsung the wall like that is crazy stuff, and you're spending like you
[3490.20 → 3495.80] know half a million dollars on it like by the time you can spend 30 grand on a TV what's half
[3495.80 → 3502.60] a million dollars who care what's the difference uh firestorm says Linus you're not being fair to
[3502.60 → 3507.16] some of us answer me this if you did video production and can't afford a brand new RTX
[3508.12 → 3515.72] squadron 6000 would you buy the RTX 3090 or the RTX titan it's a no-brainer i would buy the 3090
[3515.72 → 3520.52] because from that perspective it's actually a great value but then why are you mad what are you even
[3520.52 → 3529.00] talking about it absolutely stomps all over those previous options for that particular workload now
[3529.00 → 3537.24] i can see people being mad about the fact that RTX 3080 with 20 gigs of ram is coming, but that ain't
[3537.24 → 3542.60] new either there's always a new product coming that's going to devalue the one you have why are
[3542.60 → 3546.20] they oh that's why they're mad yeah that's why they're mad because they don't want to i don't think
[3546.20 → 3549.32] that's reasonable either because of what you just said there's always a new product coming there's
[3549.32 → 3554.28] always an early adopter tax of course that's why they launched the high-end one first that's like
[3554.28 → 3560.04] saying oh people who buy the RTX 3080 should be upset because there's going to be a RTX 3070
[3560.04 → 3565.80] of course there is people who buy the RTX 3070 should be mad because there's going to be a RTX 4000
[3565.80 → 3570.76] series of course there is what do you guys want you bought a 1080 there was a 1080 ti coming down the line
[3570.76 → 3576.12] that's the game you don't like the game don't play the game go home take your ball like i don't know
[3576.12 → 3583.88] what to tell you guys there are ways to navigate this ecosystem, but you have to take it upon yourself
[3583.88 → 3590.68] you have to be an educated consumer that's how as a student i was able to have a baller gaming rig
[3590.68 → 3599.16] because i never actually lost money on it, i spent money, but it was cumulative i would buy things for
[3599.16 → 3604.68] cheap i would sell them for more I'd build systems for people on the side I'd put that money back into my
[3604.68 → 3611.88] hobby and while yes i did own like a two thousand dollar like sick rig or whatever that was money
[3611.88 → 3617.80] that had like kind of cycled through multiple parts over and over and over again so i was at worst losing
[3617.80 → 3622.52] you know five percent on an upgrade from one gen to an act to the next gen and that means you have to
[3622.52 → 3628.52] constantly be watching the rumours watching the news reading the reviews really knowing not just the cost
[3628.52 → 3633.80] of the products but the value of the products that's why you would never buy you know something that
[3633.80 → 3640.28] you think is going to depreciate too much because hey something new could come out and then you just
[3640.28 → 3648.28] got owned it's like the same 1080ti versus 1080 is not comparable to 20 gigabyte model versus 10 gigabyte
[3648.28 → 3652.76] model you're right i was just talking about there's a new product coming down the line which was the
[3652.76 → 3659.64] current statement actually yeah what are you going to do about it all right lets uh should we actually
[3659.64 → 3664.52] talk about oh my goodness we haven't even talked about our sponsors we've talked about almost nothing
[3664.52 → 3670.68] yeah well yes and no that was like very extensively one topic three topics in one and also that's true
[3670.68 → 3676.36] that's fair we reflected on our younger selves a lot ridge wallet and reflect on that
[3676.36 → 3680.28] stop carrying pointless items around your pocket like receipts old hotel room keys and spent gift
[3680.28 → 3685.88] cards like anyone goes to a hotel any more ridge wallet helps you carry less they use two metal plates that
[3685.88 → 3690.36] are bound by a strong elastic band to keep your cards tightly together but still easily accessible
[3690.36 → 3695.80] they're RFID blocking they offer a lifetime guarantee, and they're available in aluminum carbon fibre and titanium

[3789.32 → 3793.08] and a half yeah i definitely want to talk about that hit me tell me about it
[3793.08 → 3801.56] it is the first thing i want to go into is the 7.5 billion number because like at a certain at a
[3801.56 → 3810.68] certain value i think people's brains just go like yeah it's a lot whatever yeah, but it's like actually
[3811.32 → 3818.04] a gargantuan number like something that got brought up this is not original research by me, i saw this on a
[3818.04 → 3826.20] tweet i think was someone was looking at Disney's acquit acquisitions in comparison to this Pixar
[3826.20 → 3839.16] in 2006 cost Disney less to buy than minimax wow that's kind of mind-blowing marvel in 2009 cost Disney
[3839.88 → 3847.56] uh a little over half of what minimax cost marvel was so Pixar was 7.4 billion technically below
[3848.44 → 3856.84] marvel was 4 billion Lucasfilm in 2012 was also 4 billion can you imagine if Microsoft had bought
[3856.84 → 3863.00] Lucasfilm but like at this rate they could have bought marvel and Lucasfilm for like barely more
[3863.00 → 3870.68] than they bought minimax like they could have rather own marvel and like Star Wars or minimax that kind of
[3870.68 → 3878.92] seems like a no-brainer doesn't it right like this price is huge and like i don't know
[3878.92 → 3884.36] maybe there was a bidding war going on or something i have no idea but like that's a monstrous i mean
[3884.36 → 3890.12] it's not like these aren't hugely influential intellectual properties we're talking Bethesda
[3890.12 → 3896.28] software, so there's your Elder Scrolls your fallout id software got your doom quake and rage arcane
[3896.28 → 3903.32] studios so that's dishonoured and prey machine games Wolfenstein and more and this grows the
[3903.32 → 3912.28] number of in-house Xbox game development studios to 23 up from 15. That is huge like it's massive
[3912.28 → 3920.68] they're a massive acquisition it's just it's just like 7.5 billion is a lot of money that's just that's
[3920.68 → 3926.76] that it's like wow and like it really bought them something amazing which is there's been so and
[3926.76 → 3931.24] like this isn't going to change that necessarily but there's been so much talk about like oh well
[3931.24 → 3938.04] the PlayStation has the good exclusives and yes uh the exclusives that were coming from minimax to the
[3938.04 → 3942.36] place that is all Microsoft is not messing with those agreements that is all going to still be honoured
[3942.36 → 3948.92] so death loop and ghost wire Tokyo are both going to be timed exclusives for Sony but Microsoft is just like
[3948.92 → 3957.16] I don't know they're muscling up like this is huge yeah like it's all fine and good to be able to
[3957.16 → 3962.20] negotiate exclusives with independent developers but if there are no independent developers left
[3962.84 → 3967.08] you basically have to be Nintendo and at what point does Microsoft just go
[3967.72 → 3971.08] join can buy Nintendo no that's it probably couldn't Nintendo has so much
[3971.08 → 3975.08] how would you even buy Nintendo's bank account like how much cash does Nintendo have on hand
[3975.08 → 3983.32] i yeah it's its huge I'm also really hoping because like when I was a younger me
[3984.12 → 3991.24] Bethesda was my favourite developer how about now how about now not so much you know
[3993.08 → 3999.64] the state of Elder Scrolls they've been releasing the same damn game for like nine years which is
[3999.64 → 4005.96] obscene like there was decently large release gaps between their previous games because they made
[4005.96 → 4012.12] giant games in the Elder Scrolls series, but now it's just huge and unreasonable and then fallout 76
[4012.12 → 4019.08] was just absolute trash like just terrible game they literally gave it out for free because no one
[4019.08 → 4026.20] was buying it because it was so garbage like hopefully a new owner can light some fire under their
[4026.20 → 4034.36] buns I'm just and also obsidian and Bethesda having the same parent company and this has been pointed
[4034.36 → 4042.12] out a million times as well, but that is super cool because we could be looking for like new obsidian
[4042.12 → 4050.60] fallout game which is awesome because fallout new Vegas was great um Nintendo has over 11 billion cash
[4050.60 → 4059.40] on hand in case you're wondering that's actually just so amazing that's like let's like let's just
[4059.40 → 4065.24] make our own theme park money you know yeah yeah yeah true yeah yeah do you want to do you wanna
[4065.24 → 4070.84] hey, hey okay i know I say stuff like this sometimes and sometimes I don't always follow through
[4070.84 → 4076.92] we haven't watched Star Wars together at all yet but I'm going to say this now we're going to go to
[4076.92 → 4083.32] Nintendo land together once this lockdown crap is over all right I'm so down let's do it absolutely
[4083.32 → 4088.92] we're going to Japan all right beautiful all right yeah Japan was we were there for an extremely short
[4088.92 → 4092.76] period I don't know if you've gone back but no I haven't that was it yeah we were there for an
[4092.76 → 4097.72] extremely short period of time and that was one of my favourite trips I've ever done in my life it was
[4097.72 → 4102.52] sweet we were there for like 36 hours or something hey we made the most of it we did
[4102.52 → 4110.04] got that ramen I recently showed someone I don't even remember why but I showed someone the
[4110.04 → 4116.68] moron tour video and I had forgotten until I brought it up but I remembered like the state in which we
[4116.68 → 4126.60] filmed that ed was so drunk it was bad and none of the rest of us knew how to operate the camera like
[4126.60 → 4137.24] oh Geez that was quite the trip it was absolutely horrible like man i the way that guy
[4137.24 → 4144.92] used to drink I'm glad he still you know works is alive to work here um sorry ed maybe this isn't
[4144.92 → 4152.04] something you would have had me talk I don't think he cares but um he was the state of the video but yeah
[4152.04 → 4156.92] well okay to be clear okay hold on a second I should clarify it wasn't like it wasn't an all the
[4156.92 → 4164.68] time thing it was a when we travelled thing so he was yeah when it was free wow did he ever put it away
[4164.68 → 4172.20] like unbelievable our first CES he would pass out drunk at when we'd get back to our hotel room at
[4172.20 → 4176.60] like two in the morning he was always hours and stuff too, and we had actually I think we had forgotten
[4176.60 → 4181.72] about that video which is why we filmed it when he was in that state yeah he would, he would
[4181.72 → 4187.80] wake up like an hour and a half later edit for like two hours like in like a what's it called
[4187.80 → 4193.56] like a fugue state and then sleep for another two hours, and we'd be up at six in the morning hitting
[4193.56 → 4200.12] the show floor he did it the entire week I'm pretty sure that old man ed who is the current ed I'm
[4200.12 → 4206.60] pretty sure he would die if he tried to replicate what he did at CES 2013. I think a lot of us would to
[4206.60 → 4212.28] be completely fair um yeah I mean some of the stuff we used to do i I don't think I'd be physically
[4212.28 → 4219.88] capable of anymore like the the original uh titan launch like we made like eight
[4219.88 → 4227.64] videos about one card in like days yeah and the amount of yeah I did not really sleep that whole
[4227.64 → 4232.92] week and i just yeah like i I try every once in a while something will happen where like I need to be
[4232.92 → 4239.24] on it for an extremely large amount of hours in a row, and they're strenuous now and back then it was
[4239.24 → 4243.64] just like ah whatever I don't really care I'm not going to feel it I'm gonna I'm going to have some
[4243.64 → 4249.08] noodles yeah like sure whatever yeah and now like I'll wake up in the morning and I'm genuinely sick
[4250.04 → 4256.76] and like I'm I'm paying for it yep yeah but yeah this is actually I'm excited and this
[4256.76 → 4262.28] wouldn't normally excite me but I think the reason why I'm excited is I feel like especially Bethesda which is
[4262.28 → 4267.24] my favourite one out of this I haven't been way too into the Wolfenstein games as of late yeah
[4267.24 → 4273.00] dishonoured was really cool last couple doom games have been pretty cool yeah that's very true the do
[4273.00 → 4279.24] so doom and the Bethesda games are the ones that I care about in that mix but um I'm I'm really hoping
[4279.24 → 4287.72] that Bethesda gets some get some fire under them um I'm worried I'm worried that effectively what's
[4287.72 → 4294.68] going to happen is the same thing that Amazon is doing to uh retail is you're going to you're going
[4294.68 → 4300.76] to lose out on the spice of life that is the variety that comes from a healthy and
[4300.76 → 4308.28] diverse ecosystem and I feel like you know as much as acquiring companies claim that they always
[4308.28 → 4313.72] release a statement like this you know uh you know we love everything about what they're doing
[4313.72 → 4318.76] and it's so great that we're not going to change anything we just wanted to add them to our
[4318.76 → 4325.88] portfolio it never works out how'd that work out for twitch something that I would argue is that gaming
[4325.88 → 4335.24] has been like sick for a while now um and I think the Activision blizzards of the world and the EAS of the
[4335.24 → 4342.44] world are showing that and like the amount of output and the amount of focus that yeah that gets
[4342.44 → 4348.36] based on the Activision blizzards and the EAS and the horse armour crafters um although that reference
[4348.36 → 4354.52] is probably so old now that you're probably one of the few people that gets it um, but that is
[4354.52 → 4360.52] dominating the scene by a massive amount because there is so unfortunately it is consumer driven
[4360.52 → 4368.44] there is so much money in making terrible games that you can spend a lot on yeah like it's its actually
[4368.44 → 4373.48] a thing and people will do it and there's like there doesn't seem to be anything that community
[4373.48 → 4382.12] voice can solve here because whales will wail no matter what people say yeah uh so like yeah junk
[4382.12 → 4387.16] games that you can spend a ton on very, very empty soulless games that you can spend a ton on are doing
[4387.16 → 4394.12] really well, and it's its cool to me that the fall guys and the among us games out there have started
[4394.12 → 4399.96] actually kind of popping off because they're a little bit smaller studios smaller teams genuinely
[4399.96 → 4406.84] really fun focused games yeah pc gaming needs so much more of that it absolutely does and something
[4406.84 → 4411.64] that i really really really hope turns out to be awesome, but we probably won't hear anything from it
[4411.64 → 4420.28] for quite a few years is dream haven have you heard about this no, no it's not in the doc um but mike
[4420.28 → 4430.92] moraine the's an original co-founder and former CEO of blizzard entertainment oh wow from way back
[4430.92 → 4437.64] at the beginning like I'm talking the lost Vikings era like he's from that he co-founded the original
[4437.64 → 4441.96] I think they were called something before they were called blizzard but like he co-founded the way back
[4441.96 → 4448.76] then and then was clearly very unhappy with the Activision stuff, and then he left I think like two years ago
[4448.76 → 4455.88] he yeah uh, and then he came out of retirement to found dream haven um and I can, I'll say I like the
[4455.88 → 4462.28] name if he lives up to the name then it sounds pretty good the name is actually the whole point
[4462.28 → 4467.96] as far as he's saying it and you said something very recently that was like everyone says this and like
[4467.96 → 4474.52] to a lot of degrees yes but I think he's actually directly addressing in here a lot of the issues that i
[4474.52 → 4480.04] think the gaming industry has had for a long time when they're taking these artists and these
[4480.04 → 4485.80] creatives, and they're bleeding them for microtransactions and trying to get them to pump out garbage
[4485.80 → 4489.56] that they can sell they're trying to shrink deadlines they're trying to do all this other kind of stuff
[4489.56 → 4496.60] to make terrible things you can spend a lot of money on and uh they they they go into the details
[4496.60 → 4502.60] here I wasn't ready for this but um the opening statement is welcome to dream haven we love epic
[4502.60 → 4506.12] adventures sharing stories and creating lasting memories with family and friends so we're building
[4506.12 → 4511.24] a new game company based on our shared values and relentless passion for making meaningful player
[4511.24 → 4520.84] experiences, and they go on later into basically talking about having the goal to not be massive financial
[4520.84 → 4526.92] gain but the goal to be high quality games and sustaining yourself off of that instead well if
[4526.92 → 4533.16] Nintendo has anything to go on it, you can have it can work it can absolutely work you're right like
[4533.16 → 4537.24] Nintendo is a great example for that and that's one of the reasons why I've been a fanboy of Nintendo
[4537.24 → 4543.24] for a long time of that not of everything sometimes Nintendo makes mistakes oh absolutely the Wii U
[4544.52 → 4550.68] just in general oh I just meant more than being like jerks um oh sure yeah yeah they were
[4550.68 → 4556.60] extremely stupid around the originating of game streaming and stuff like that they've made massive
[4556.60 → 4562.84] mistakes but in general they seem to strive for quality which is important um so they
[4562.84 → 4569.56] already have two studios under the wings of dream haven uh called moonshot games and secret door
[4570.28 → 4576.52] and I don't I don't think there are much details about what those studios plan to do um hopefully what
[4576.52 → 4580.76] they plan to do isn't exactly what's already commercially successful on the market, or they're
[4580.76 → 4586.36] going to have another what was that uh MMO that lasted for like months wild star something like that
[4586.36 → 4594.36] I remember going to I remember going to pax, and they had like this gigantic booth and the thing launched
[4594.36 → 4601.08] and it was just like yeah it's like wow but bad like okay and then how long did Amazon's uh Amazon's new
[4601.08 → 4608.68] shooter last on uh like their public release, and they like to take it back private or something stupid like that
[4608.68 → 4616.04] I was following it a little while ago Amazon games I didn't even yeah crucible that's right crucible
[4616.04 → 4623.08] so it went from like people were being paid to play it to nobody was playing it and then went back into closed beta
[4623.08 → 4631.48] like oops at least they did that to be honest at least they didn't just leave it burn like Ea probably
[4631.48 → 4636.60] would I don't even remember what game that was but there was a game that came out from Ea
[4636.60 → 4643.48] that was just actual garbage and they just like tried to erase it from history basically
[4644.36 → 4651.24] I'm sure twitch chat remembers but classified says yes classified says CD project read anyone well okay
[4651.24 → 4656.92] yes but also no there are examples yes but also no CD project red has the luxury and this was a good
[4656.92 → 4661.00] business move and I'm not saying I'm not going to give them credit for it, but they have the
[4661.00 → 4666.68] luxury of what I call valve privilege where they get to work on games for fun because they feel like
[4666.68 → 4672.68] working on games because they also have good old games which keeps them flush with cash so if they
[4672.68 → 4677.96] don't release a game for five years no one has to worry about like what they're going to eat
[4677.96 → 4686.44] they can just eat a cut of other people's game sales um and I'm not saying that's like bad it's
[4686.44 → 4693.00] it's good I love good old games love the model um yeah love all the guys over there it's just
[4693.64 → 4699.48] uh games actually didn't bring in much for them yeah, but it brings in consistent yes it's something you
[4699.48 → 4706.92] can rely on yeah and like yeah there there are examples of companies that aren't doing that but
[4706.92 → 4713.40] as a whole i I think it would be fairly hard to argue that the state of the video gaming
[4713.40 → 4723.00] industry is like very healthy um you don't want another NHL game NHL bubble edition it feels like
[4723.00 → 4729.48] a lot of the I would say the majority of the big players in the video gaming industry are kind of
[4729.48 → 4736.76] phoning it in and cashing out yep that's fair I mean that's that's not a good or healthy thing
[4736.76 → 4745.00] for good quality within that industry so let's see if Microsoft um you know does better because if
[4745.00 → 4752.28] there's one thing we've learned from the Netflix model from the model of whatever it is as a
[4752.28 → 4761.08] service it's that it can keep you flush with cash so that you can afford to make investments and what
[4761.08 → 4764.92] it can do so it provides that stability because you've got those recurring payments so that you
[4764.92 → 4772.28] can invest, but it also incentivizes investing in legitimately great experiences because you want
[4772.28 → 4778.76] people to keep paying their monthly fee um so you know there's no question that Netflix has produced a
[4778.76 → 4785.24] ton of really great original content and sometimes about things that other more traditional production
[4785.24 → 4790.44] companies might not even touch like they did something on um like a Chinese protest or something
[4790.44 → 4795.56] a documentary a little while ago that you know if I was Disney there's no way i would do that or
[4795.56 → 4800.84] any of the bazillion things that Disney owns and that's really cool because in a sense that's almost
[4800.84 → 4807.96] like um it's almost like a more democratic way of uh of creating content because it's ultimately funded
[4807.96 → 4813.32] by the people for the people now Netflix is a public company, and you know beholden to shareholders
[4813.32 → 4816.68] and all that other kind of stuff, so there's definitely some complication there I'm just saying
[4817.24 → 4823.96] it's a little bit uh it's a little bit more sustainable so if Microsoft is building what is
[4823.96 → 4830.20] essentially like the Netflix of gaming through their Xbox experiences acquiring all these game developers
[4830.20 → 4836.28] with the intention of like okay look guys no just make great games so that people never put down their Xbox
[4836.28 → 4842.76] and always just keep reinvesting in the Xbox ecosystem well I can see why Microsoft said and
[4842.76 → 4848.04] this was months ago we don't even see Sony as a competitor anymore because lord only knows how long
[4848.04 → 4853.16] they've had this in the works they could still do things better I mean did you see people were
[4853.16 → 4859.72] accidentally buying Xbox One X's because Microsoft's naming scheme is so utterly stupid
[4859.72 → 4868.36] that people don't do know what series x is or one x or series s or like what are you doing stop
[4868.36 → 4873.16] it's so easy one two three four five Sony can do it and like
[4875.80 → 4878.20] there that's it that's all I have to say about it
[4878.76 → 4884.76] series is a really stupid name it's so stupid and I'm sure there's some like deep meaning like
[4884.76 → 4889.00] we talked about this on a previous wan show actually where like maybe they're calling it
[4889.00 → 4894.12] series because it's the final Xbox, and they're just going to keep doing series is, and they're just
[4894.12 → 4900.28] going to run at different levels of graphical fidelity or whatever the point is it doesn't matter
[4900.28 → 4906.68] you have to make things clear for the consumer I blame apple it is apple's fault that we just keep
[4906.68 → 4916.44] calling the product macBook without clarifying which macBook which Xbox is it I actually need to
[4916.44 → 4922.28] know these things because it affects things like controller intergenerational compatibility and like
[4922.28 → 4930.20] what games run on it and what TVs it hooks up to and interfaces it has it's stupid just the original
[4930.20 → 4939.72] Xbox name was pretty cool I think Xbox 360 was like okay and then since then I think everything has been
[4939.72 → 4948.12] a mistake yeah 100 calling it the Xbox One was asinine not good because when I say Xbox now I have
[4948.12 → 4955.96] to say original Xbox which is a lot of syllables wasted how much oxygen has Microsoft wasted from people
[4955.96 → 4962.52] having to say original Xbox like how many lives I'm sure there's an intention even though it might
[4962.52 → 4967.80] be a benefit to a certain degree but like buying an Xbox controller on Craigslist is kind of hard
[4968.52 → 4975.32] right yeah that makes sense like it's its annoying, and it's hard because you have very inconsistent
[4975.32 → 4983.96] listing names because it's Craigslist so it's like I don't know oh Nintendo is really rough on their
[4983.96 → 4991.88] handhelds yeah someone listed uh new Nintendo 3ds XL and then I think they had new Nintendo 3ds XL plus
[4991.88 → 4998.36] yeah or something like i I make fun of that all the time yeah like how hard is it cooper says the
[4998.36 → 5003.40] problem is they can't name it Xbox 4 because uneducated consumers would see PS5 and go oh that's
[5003.40 → 5013.72] one number bigger fine, but everyone knew the solution way back years ago Xbox 720 then if you absolutely
[5013.72 → 5018.04] must like if you must have stupid irrelevant numbers that's what everyone thought it was
[5018.04 → 5022.12] going to be everyone thought it was going to be Xbox 720 they came out with Xbox One, and we were like
[5022.12 → 5027.96] what connect what yeah hub of the media what are you talking about, and then they ran out and bought
[5027.96 → 5037.00] PlayStation yeah so just like making simple branding is actually really easy and Microsoft knows how to do it
[5037.00 → 5043.80] gold membership oh that's like good and shiny I'll get that one they know how to do it they just also
[5043.80 → 5050.60] know how to confuse people for no reason making confusing branding is actually harder than making
[5050.60 → 5059.00] simple branding because all the rules already exist gold silver bronze and then oh shoot uh oh we came up
[5059.00 → 5065.24] with something better oh platinum throw that in there no problem you know one two three
[5065.24 → 5072.76] four five oh there oh shoot there's one that's like kind of in between call it the five plus whatever it's
[5072.76 → 5079.80] it's easy it's easy making things difficult for consumers to understand the cynic in me thinks that
[5079.80 → 5087.32] like you know back when uh you know and NVIDIA was going through a dark time in the fermi days when they
[5087.32 → 5094.84] were just like rebranding cards or when AMD rebranded the uh what was it the 79 70 like four times or
[5094.84 → 5100.36] however many times they did it like the cynic in me just goes like okay yeah I guess you just you have
[5100.36 → 5106.12] to resell the know the same or a worse product, and you need people to think it's new so that the
[5106.12 → 5110.52] media will cover it again and so people will run out and like to buy the new one or whatever it is and I get
[5110.52 → 5116.92] some consumers are probably that stupid but for everyone else please just call it what it is
[5117.32 → 5124.60] yeah I'm not surprised at all that this happened, and it's just disappointing
[5126.04 → 5130.92] all right but yeah I'm exhausted now big Nazi might be faster than the 3080.
[5131.64 → 5136.36] one quick thing I want to throw out before we leave is there's a statement from someone at minimax
[5136.36 → 5138.76] saying like the real winners today are the gamers
[5139.96 → 5144.44] no the real winners are the real winners are the people that have sold their company for 7.5 billion
[5144.44 → 5149.96] yeah you're not fooling anyone there are some cool things for the gamers, but the real winners are you
[5150.76 → 5157.64] yeah stuff it sorry we can continue uh big Nazi might be faster than 3080 according to some
[5157.64 → 5163.08] firmware listing something 80 compute units I'll believe it when I see it sweet Spotify
[5163.08 → 5168.76] tile ProtonMail and base camp join epic against apple the coalition published a list of 10 app store
[5168.76 → 5172.84] principles no developer should be required to use an app store exclusively no developer should be
[5172.84 → 5177.32] blocked or discriminated against if they compete with the app store owner uh yeah every developer
[5177.32 → 5181.64] should have timely access to interoperability interfaces and technical information yep should
[5181.64 → 5185.96] have access to the app store as long as they meet basic standards security privacy quality digital safety
[5185.96 → 5190.44] developers data should not be used to compete with the developer yeah freaking obviously like these are
[5190.44 → 5196.36] all such like obvious antitrust violations that absolutely apple has violated
[5197.48 → 5202.28] every developer should be able to communicate with users through its app uh yeah no app store should be
[5202.28 → 5207.56] able to engage in self-preferencing um yeah no developer should be required to pay unfair fees
[5207.56 → 5212.44] nor be required to sell within its app anything it doesn't wish to sell and uh all app stores should
[5212.44 → 5216.68] be transparent about their rules and policies that's a big one that's one of the places where apple's
[5216.68 → 5221.16] arguments might really fall apart where they're trying to say like it's all in the interest of the
[5221.16 → 5226.20] smoothness of the experience except that it isn't smooth, and you are not applying the rules equally
[5226.20 → 5233.56] um, and it's well documented that they're not uh, so there's that oh, oh my goodness we've got a new
[5233.56 → 5245.24] ltdstore.com merch item uh do you have it uh i can get if it was warm I left it at the office I left it on my
[5245.24 → 5249.80] chair I don't have it okay Luke's going to go get it but I'm going to show you guys look at this guy with this beard and this
[5249.80 → 5257.32] comfy gray sweater and whoa does it have a hidden pocket is there a hidden pocket down there
[5257.32 → 5265.24] that can fit a note nine you can put your hands in it to look at that we've got all kinds of different
[5265.24 → 5272.36] sizes and shapes of people to show you what it looks like look at this guy isn't he beautiful hey it's
[5272.36 → 5278.60] Andy Anthony more David wait a minute is this the same pictures over and over again look at this guy he's
[5278.60 → 5283.88] all like loser no he's pointing at the Ltd logo so we went with really subtle branding on this one
[5283.88 → 5290.52] it's just meant to be like it's got like a fleecy inside um not actual fleece so it's 100 cotton french
[5290.52 → 5297.24] terry, and it's like really warm and like snuggly um kind of like a bit of a looser fit than some of
[5297.24 → 5302.12] the stuff that we've done before that's more form fitted, but we think it's going to be extremely
[5302.12 → 5308.36] popular um the one problem is you might want to buy two instead of just one because there is a
[5308.36 → 5313.40] high probability if mine and Luke's experience is anything to go by that your lady will steal it
[5313.40 → 5319.56] from you the second you bring it home um yeah like the one that i the prototype one that I've had
[5319.56 → 5323.96] for actually like months at this point we've been working on this one a long time uh Yvonne has probably
[5323.96 → 5332.52] worn it like eight times to my one um so we decided on what I think is very reasonable pricing on
[5332.52 → 5339.88] this one we're doing 39.99 uh compared to the stealth hoodie and the swacked there was just I mean it
[5339.88 → 5343.72] actually did end up being a ton of work because it's a totally different size chart and because
[5343.72 → 5349.08] there's less um stretch in the material we had to do a lot of work to make sure that it'd be comfortable
[5349.08 → 5355.64] to put on and all that kind of stuff, but it was less um less custom sewing um than something like
[5355.64 → 5361.00] stealth hoodie or swacked so uh we were like okay well yeah hey why don't we do why don't we do 40 bucks
[5361.00 → 5367.56] let's do a 40 sweater um actually about the right season to be putting it on sale accidentally uh
[5368.12 → 5373.48] yeah it was supposed to be last winter but don't worry about it too much just head over to
[5373.48 → 5380.36] ltdstore.com get one for yourself um yeah super subtle branding we don't want our merch to be like
[5380.36 → 5385.16] you know hey you have to broadcast to everyone in your social circle that you really like Linus
[5385.16 → 5389.08] tech tips but if you want to do that you can get a stealth hoodie which has liked you know the logo
[5389.08 → 5393.64] down the arm or whatever we definitely have stuff like that this is just more for staying comfy and
[5393.64 → 5400.52] cozy when you're when you're gaming hopefully you guys like it yeah, so someone commented why are the
[5400.52 → 5407.48] arms so long i so I showed like when my arm is out it is not super long yeah, and you can you that's
[5407.48 → 5412.04] one of the reasons i actually it's it sort of happened just by accident like people actually like
[5412.04 → 5419.00] doing it which is really cool like modelling merch is not in anybody's job descriptions but people just
[5419.00 → 5423.64] have stepped up and are just like yeah sure I'll do it I want to do it, and so I really like that sorry
[5423.64 → 5428.52] to cut you off but I really like that so many people do it because you really get to see how it
[5428.52 → 5436.52] fits on like a really wide variety of actual humans instead of like yeah I don't know it's its cool
[5436.52 → 5443.16] instead of models because we don't have any models this is all just people who work here's a bunch of
[5443.16 → 5447.56] people that you have probably seen a fair amount of times, and they're fairly consistent
[5447.56 → 5451.40] throughout the store so you see them in a bunch of different stuff yeah, and you can tell kind of how
[5451.40 → 5456.28] it fits if you buy something, and you see the pictures, and it fits a certain person in a certain
[5456.28 → 5460.20] way, and you're like wow this fits me really nicely then you see that person wearing something
[5460.20 → 5463.96] different in the future, and it fits them nicely you can probably guess that it's going to fit you
[5463.96 → 5469.40] nicely again like that's actually super cool I don't know that's a benefit in my eyes ice peter
[5469.40 → 5475.48] asks who buy this trash um lots and lots of people who are like actually pretty stoked on our trash for
[5475.48 → 5482.76] the most part it's its been it's been a very, very successful uh part of the business for us because
[5483.56 → 5489.40] we have another business that can allow us to invest in it and not rush anything um I actually killed
[5489.40 → 5495.64] a product yesterday that was supposed to launch on this wan show um it was a long sleeve with short
[5495.64 → 5502.20] circuit branding that I wasn't happy with the sleeve length and the fit um because the final garments
[5502.20 → 5510.68] that we got did not match um what I had approved so basically they were going to have sleeves that were
[5510.68 → 5516.12] too long and kind of bunched up weird, and it was a difficult decision because we've already printed
[5516.12 → 5522.68] hundreds of them, so those are just going to get donated now um, but that product is not launching
[5522.68 → 5529.16] and we're not taking your money for it um so that's why people buy this trash because it's not trash um
[5529.80 → 5534.28] because we don't have to push out trash we can just take our time and do it right that's why
[5536.28 → 5541.32] uh viewer activity let's have a look at some uh some trash comments from people who paid to send
[5541.32 → 5546.52] comments because they're crazy uh Jürgen says hey when will wan show be available as Vaud on float
[5546.52 → 5552.44] plane yeah Luke should we do that at some point we should probably do that what are we doing sorry
[5552.44 → 5560.28] when show Vaud on float plane uh yeah we probably should, I know you can yep I know you can you know that
[5561.80 → 5567.56] Zoe melt says shout out to the LTC folding team now that it's cooling off in the north I can fold again
[5567.56 → 5573.48] sweet also video suggestion 12 VO car pc build that runs directly off the car's electricity that's
[5573.48 → 5577.56] actually not a bad idea Thomas says uh what's Nick's twitter handle so I can bother him about
[5577.56 → 5586.28] possibly making those collared elemental shirts for ltcstore.com uh at nick leg I think i actually
[5586.28 → 5591.56] don't know I'm pretty sure that's it I'm Jake yes it is saying hey just scored an jobs today using
[5591.56 → 5597.40] knowledge I learned from leg videos thanks for sparking my interest hey that is sick that's freaking
[5597.40 → 5603.08] awesome uh theories says in case you didn't mention it any takers on the shifty stealth pins
[5603.80 → 5607.80] shifty stealth pins shifty oh oh oh you mean the um
[5609.64 → 5613.32] hmm mine doesn't make sense, but it's probably just me and everyone who asked me about it
[5613.32 → 5618.92] uh I think you're talking about the people who got gaming rigs from their stealth pins
[5618.92 → 5624.20] shirts that they bought on the store um two of them have been claimed already yes I actually don't
[5624.20 → 5628.36] know if the third one got claimed they might not have seen it on the land show so hey if your stealth
[5628.36 → 5633.88] pin shirt has something different other than LTT spelled out in it uh go check and send a picture
[5633.88 → 5640.68] to the support team um I had another update no I can't give you guys that update yet but
[5641.24 → 5646.68] Robert mail says gigabyte 3070 leaked on discord 1815 boost clock oh okay
[5646.68 → 5655.80] um Luke says I would like a GPU with no dents when I spend 30 80 money yeah a little bit um
[5657.08 → 5660.92] Baja truck guy says I work at a machine shop and I have some minimum wage employees they don't
[5660.92 → 5666.28] understand they need to work above their pay to get ahead in the job yeah back to that I mean I get it
[5666.28 → 5671.64] I see both sides because if they feel like its dead end they're not going to want to invest and if you
[5671.64 → 5675.80] feel like they're a dead end loser you're not going to want to invest in them and then nobody invests in
[5675.80 → 5680.84] anybody and the business suffers everybody suffers because when a business doesn't succeed
[5680.84 → 5689.32] everyone loses their job I mean uh except for this broken mega sort of corporation situation where
[5689.96 → 5696.04] everyone above us yeah you get a golden parachute which I think is horrible like i honestly I have
[5696.04 → 5700.12] no problem with you know I don't agree with Elon Musk about everything but I have no problem with
[5700.12 → 5706.84] his compensation being based on performance on the job like that I can get behind you know if you
[5706.84 → 5710.12] are going to pay yourself you know millions of dollars a year or whatever when things are going
[5710.12 → 5715.56] good yeah sure fine whatever but you better get paid zero dollars a year when things are going bad
[5715.56 → 5721.32] because executives are ultimately supposed to be what guide the ship so if the ship's going in the
[5721.32 → 5729.08] wrong direction the buck has to stop somewhere um my channel Luke what colour LTT bottle should I get
[5729.64 → 5738.76] Linus won't get my jingle unless you answer i my favourite one is the white and black but the
[5738.76 → 5747.16] the fairly standard black and gold is very, very cool um I think most people like this one and I think
[5747.16 → 5753.24] it's with decently good reason but I like the white one my girlfriend loves the pink one surprise
[5754.52 → 5760.44] uh josh says I got the 3090 ftw3 ultra but I'm not either of the customers you mentioned I wanted the
[5760.44 → 5765.56] extra VRAM and the 30 80 20 gig will probably be somewhere between the new cards and price I won't
[5765.56 → 5771.88] need to upgrade for a while now, but you also don't sound mad so you wanted the state of the art which
[5771.88 → 5777.08] was one of the people that I outlined by the way okay yeah sounds like when you outlined
[5777.08 → 5782.12] to be completely honest uh all baker says I want to buy a new Mac mini soon is there a point do you
[5782.12 → 5788.76] think to buying the maximum available storage capacity i I don't know I would, you buy a mac now
[5788.76 → 5796.84] knowing that the arm stuff is coming that's tough hey buy a mac at all well yeah but okay fine um
[5796.84 → 5801.48] that's literally mostly just because like I would have no idea what to do once it sat in front of me
[5801.48 → 5806.28] I also can't see I just don't even want to learn I can't see any reason in the year 2020 to buy a
[5806.28 → 5812.20] system with maxed out storage like the money that you have to spend on storage upgrades for some of
[5812.20 → 5820.20] those like um tier one pcs you might as well just like put together a cheap NAS with spinning disks
[5820.84 → 5827.64] and then only keep the ones that are only kept the things you absolutely need on your machine like who has
[5827.64 → 5833.64] more than 256 gigs of actual applications that they need on something like a Mac mini like it's
[5833.64 → 5837.00] not like you're loading it up with a bunch of like Call of Duty modern warfare like what are you putting
[5837.00 → 5842.28] on there you should be working off of a NAS so I would invest in the 10 gig interface and like some
[5842.28 → 5849.16] 10 gig gear I'd build out my network infrastructure over time I wouldn't uh okay weeping Lin says I want
[5849.16 → 5855.88] a dishwasher safe water bottle unfortunately all the vacuum walled water bottles are not dishwasher
[5855.88 → 5859.64] safe just because your other one doesn't have a warning about it doesn't mean you should put it
[5859.64 → 5873.40] in the dishwasher all right that's it uh what merch idea long johns and long sleeve shirt made yeah
[5873.40 → 5878.20] hey we have to get out of here we got that among us game to get to conductive material hold on a second
[5878.20 → 5886.76] a bodysuit made of conductive material as taser proof underwear what are you talking about
[5890.92 → 5894.12] thanks for watching it would still ground into you wouldn't it
[5897.08 → 5899.16] show's over goodbye
[5899.16 → 5905.96] yeah you'd have to earth it someone just said yeah you'd still need like a grounding
[5907.72 → 5910.68] you could just drive a big stake into the ground and then just like
[5911.88 → 5916.04] you just can't move while you're basically a dog on a leash for your whole life
[5919.72 → 5920.36] that'd be great
[5920.36 → 5928.92] show's brought to you by steel series that's your footwear and
[5928.92 → 5929.40] scratchy ritual
[5929.88 → 5930.06] needle space
