[16.30 → 19.44] No, not as per usual. We've actually got a lot of great topics today
[19.86 → 25.94] Well, no, but the show is always awesome. That's the point. Oh, is it? Yeah, okay, even when it's bad
[25.94 → 28.88] It's like not that bad. See how that works. Yeah

[148.12 → 150.12] CafePress.com café press still exists, right?
[150.12 → 152.12] Apparently it's still on Cafe Press, actually
[152.12 → 159.74] uh café press.com café press still exists right apparently all right I haven't heard of them in
[159.74 → 172.44] a long time but Linus tech tips let's see uh uh-huh no match no okay Linus oh stop sites that
[172.44 → 180.30] take over your freaking cursor are bad wait why is that why is it gifting this is a bad site
[180.30 → 190.36] it's a bad site for bad people automatically puts in gifts oh man uh Linus unbox maybe oh it's that
[190.36 → 198.04] shirt yeah okay well whatever it used to be on café that was LTT merch but not leg merch right yes yeah
[198.04 → 204.74] so this was the first ever leg shirt we are finally updating it not really updating if it's completely
[204.74 → 211.14] different, but there's a new wan shirt oh my on lttstore.com oh my this is a cool way of doing
[211.14 → 215.20] oh see that's what I had forgotten to do that's why I was putting on a bunch of shirts over there
[215.20 → 224.44] that's pretty sick yeah and so for people who don't know what it stands for weekly analysis and news
[224.44 → 231.50] there's some of that and also wide area network because I love double entendres so it was that's
[231.50 → 236.76] the actual reason why that's the actual reason it has that that name I was just trying to come up
[236.76 → 241.78] with something that sounded more professional than the wide area network show so it was just supposed
[241.78 → 248.28] to be like the internet show yeah like the show on the internet yeah like the wan show hey yeah get it
[248.28 → 252.80] because it's streaming on the internet tell people right away I feel like we told people later on what
[252.80 → 257.28] it stood for I'm not I'm not sure if we might not have told people right away either way what it stands
[257.28 → 264.10] for not important so yeah new shirt ltdstore.com let's jump right into our first topic of the day
[264.10 → 270.94] according to director Rian Johnson one quick thing just for nick there's uh relatively new shipping rates
[270.94 → 277.22] so oh that's right yeah shipping is a lot cheaper now especially outside uh Canada yeah so if it's
[277.22 → 280.14] been a while since you've checked it maybe check again they're cheaper now I don't know the exact
[280.14 → 287.28] prices, but they're notably cheaper now long story, but basically we found a bunch of stealth
[287.28 → 293.60] hoodies at the warehouse yes I'm yeah nick was like hey good news we have way more stealth hoodies than i
[293.60 → 300.48] said we had and I'm like okay that's good news because it means we're not out of stock yet but that's
[300.48 → 307.00] terrible news because it means we're not tracking our inventory properly so we need to crack the whip on
[307.00 → 311.88] that a little bit anyway so you can pick up the new man shirt stealth hoodie all that good stuff
[311.88 → 320.78] all right so posted by Phil 104 on the forum the original source is from uh bbc.co.uk according to
[320.78 → 327.74] director Rian Johnson, and you didn't even get as far as letting me say his name without jumping in
[327.74 → 333.96] when we were chatting about this pre-show what is your deal i just you're really you're just gonna
[333.96 → 341.08] sulk there you're not no use your words you need to use your words he hurt he hurt me
[341.08 → 344.40] where did he touch you in my Star Wars
[344.40 → 351.40] i personally I know there are different opinions on this and I don't want to start a war
[351.40 → 354.52] uh I personally do not appreciate a star war
[354.52 → 365.72] oh that's brutal um I personally do not appreciate the
[365.72 → 371.94] things I was going to say contribution but I was like I don't think that's a worthy word
[371.94 → 375.66] uh the things that he did to Star Wars and the Star Wars universe
[375.66 → 379.18] you're just upset because mark Hamill
[379.18 → 382.88] that's part of it
[382.88 → 389.40] you're not wrong yeah you're not wrong yeah you're not wrong yeah I don't know I don't want to get way
[389.40 → 395.64] too far into that basically I find this part of something that he had to do with kind of hilarious
[395.64 → 400.98] yeah um for his latest film which is a crime mystery wow surprising uh there's one character
[400.98 → 407.20] who couldn't have an iPhone because they're like a bad guy yeah so I actually watched this movie like
[407.20 → 413.00] a couple of days ago it's called knives out um, so this would be assumedly whatever knives out
[413.00 → 418.64] too is going to be I'm assuming oh I guess so because he was talking about like uh no, no this seems to
[418.64 → 424.94] be past tense yeah it seems to be really okay um so here's the funny thing I remember running into
[424.94 → 432.16] this quite a little while ago so in apple's t's and c's for their products you actually agree
[432.16 → 439.54] by opening it and by like clicking I agree you actually agree that you will not show their logo
[439.54 → 446.80] is one of the things you agree to, and you agree that you will not um like use it for like
[446.80 → 452.52] video production purposes or something like that like I remember reading through it, and it's like
[452.52 → 458.40] you're not allowed to show the Apple logo on a thing you bought, but they like individually waive
[458.40 → 466.22] that for good guys but they well it's in their terms of service that they can come after you for it
[466.22 → 472.24] but they for the most part don't enforce it yeah okay because I was looking at that going I only ran
[472.24 → 477.58] into it back when we were trying to do a review of like the iPhone SE or something like that that was
[477.58 → 482.54] when I became aware of it because I just like I saw it there and I was like what how am I supposed
[482.54 → 487.52] to yeah how am I supposed to do this yeah without what do I have to tape over the stupid thing like
[487.52 → 493.38] enough like I'm filming a commercial on it yeah exactly, exactly um that went pear shaped fast
[493.38 → 504.12] hey um so I was so I ended up looking into how someone can possibly enforce what you can or cannot
[504.12 → 510.44] do with an object that you buy yeah because it's really it's a really gray area so on the one hand
[510.44 → 516.92] they own that logo like that's their trademark and copyright and blah blah blah blah blah but on the
[516.92 → 523.14] other hand it's not my fault they put it on the thing I bought like I'm not going to be like oh, oh wait
[523.14 → 527.64] no sorry hold on yeah we can take the family picture let me just put my phone away so the
[527.64 → 532.16] logo is not showing because I promised apple I wouldn't show it to anybody like, and it's not even an
[532.16 → 536.94] apple's best interest to have people hiding their apple logos like specifically isn't yeah why would
[536.94 → 546.92] they even want that unless they're hiding the apple logos for bad guys so in knives out um I think I'm
[546.92 → 553.94] not really spoiling anything because it's a murder mystery someone's got to be the bad guy uh apparently
[553.94 → 560.76] apple has a policy so they did not allow the bad person to use an iPhone because they have a policy
[560.76 → 567.18] where you're allowed to use iPhones and movies oh, thank you gracious apple um we can
[567.18 → 573.54] promote your product for free oh yes, thank you please bestow upon me more thy blessings um
[573.54 → 583.94] but only if it's a good guy so it seems like if I were to watch another murder mystery sometime in the
[583.94 → 591.00] future I could now have the movie spoiled for me by apple's inane policy, so there's like a bunch of
[591.00 → 599.52] people with iPhones and then one person with not an iPhone you're like oh well okay i just this is one
[599.52 → 605.50] of those things that I don't go as far as some of our viewers do on this where there's people out there
[605.50 → 611.90] that don't understand why brands don't want their product running as like a YouTube pre-roll
[611.90 → 618.76] on a very controversial video for example sure you know like why uh and I'm I'm not I'm not
[618.76 → 625.14] I don't know that this is their policy I'm just going to pick a name you know uh wall store.com or
[625.14 → 630.26] whatever okay it's not a real company or unless it is okay hold on a second real fake walls.com
[630.26 → 637.50] okay wall store.com is this the thing it's just camped domain has i actually kind of expected that
[637.50 → 642.60] to be a thing wall store.com hold on a second please tell me please tell me this is available
[642.60 → 652.44] I want wall store.com can't be there was a domain purchased on a Friday and the accounting department
[652.44 → 657.52] came to me asking if is we bought it on wan show because they couldn't forget who bought it
[657.52 → 664.02] we do that sometimes okay well I bet they would come to you if we bought this one
[664.02 → 672.22] wall store.com 50 grand no problem uh I mean it's only Canadian rubles that's like 40 grand
[672.22 → 679.06] yeah um so sorry what were we talking about again no yes right so I get it I get why a brand wouldn't
[679.06 → 689.06] want their name and their logo right before you know some very graphic or disturbing video
[689.06 → 693.38] especially wall store they spent so much money on their domain yeah or one that uh or one that
[693.38 → 698.98] expresses views that you know some people might associate with their brand and that they consider
[698.98 → 708.02] doesn't represent their brand values I understand that sort of like on the one hand I see the okay oh
[708.02 → 712.44] man I see both sides of this one because on the one hand I can see why a brand doesn't want their
[712.44 → 717.38] logo right next to you know what if the first frame of this video is like someone screeching f words
[717.38 → 722.80] about you know some ethnic minority or something like you don't you don't need that it's kind of like
[722.80 → 728.28] when people take out of context well I'm not saying that that guy whose name starts with a h was right
[728.28 → 733.58] I'm just saying where people just take that clip like it's its just not helpful you know what I mean
[733.58 → 739.86] for their image um but I also see the argument where people say look who is stupid enough to think
[739.86 → 747.98] that some ad running on YouTube somehow means that yeah that that brand endorses you know baby
[747.98 → 752.52] slavery or whatever there is some stuff that's a little funky with that though because there is
[752.52 → 759.22] because you can buy ads and target them so like when you said something that could be
[759.22 → 763.96] stereotypically related to a brand, but they don't want it to be there because they don't agree
[763.96 → 769.62] with that association if they just spread their video randomly it could land there and then people
[769.62 → 776.90] could think that it was yep targeted for that and then that reinforces that idea it's its because
[776.90 → 781.10] there is manipulation behind the scenes it makes a little bit worse and people could assume that it
[781.10 → 787.96] was on purpose I guess is what you mean yeah so that's a fair point um but I also think that some
[787.96 → 793.28] of it gets to the point of being kind of irrational so we had a recent episode of tech linked
[793.28 → 801.74] where we discussed the ongoing health sure problem that thing in the world yep, and we got a got a
[801.74 → 806.56] yellow dollar sing instead of a green one which meant limited advertising and like that's ridiculous
[806.56 → 811.94] well yes and no see again I see it from both sides because oh don't touch your eyes by the way that's
[811.94 → 823.54] bad I was touching my eyes don't do that that's right oh no um, um oh boy okay so yeah on the one hand
[823.54 → 828.42] um that seems ridiculous just because someone is talking about let's say I have a video coming out
[828.42 → 833.44] tomorrow on the Linus tech tips channel where I'm going to be discussing um what I think are going to
[833.44 → 838.14] be the effects on pricing and availability of computer hardware due to the manufacturing
[838.14 → 845.82] shutdowns and I right I end up tiptoeing around naming the issue that's going on because if I talk
[845.82 → 851.22] about it directly I'm afraid that my video is going to get demonetized that seems absurd it feels it feels
[851.22 → 859.52] like a monetization version of like speech control to a certain degree, but the flip side is I can see
[859.52 → 865.30] how if I'm an advertiser or if I'm the YouTube platform I don't want everybody in their dog
[865.30 → 876.52] jumping onto the latest viral spread or the latest uh mass shooting or the latest you know genocide or
[876.52 → 885.42] whatever it is making you know that video this thing was so bad and just talking about nothing for
[885.42 → 893.16] 10 minutes so they can cash in on a hot keyword I also have a pretty strong objection to that
[893.16 → 897.20] behaviour just making sure that you're the first to make a video about and the first to tweet about
[897.20 → 904.10] how bad something is we know it's bad thank you very much for that we have brains we can think
[904.10 → 910.26] yeah so I guess it's its hard to automatically differentiate between the content that has that
[910.26 → 915.22] subject in it that is quality and the content that has that subject in it that is just a waste of
[915.22 → 923.44] space and time so let's let's try to come up with the right answer to this one if your apple do you
[923.44 → 929.70] allow bad guys to use iPhones knowing that it is within your right to control how your trademarked and
[929.70 → 935.60] or copyrighted imagery is displayed in a commercial production like a Hollywood film if it was me
[935.60 → 943.94] without the context of you potentially countering I would now I am considering that like what does
[943.94 → 951.76] that bad guy do iPhones are for douche whatever's bags is not a bad word whatever um is like a thing
[951.76 → 957.94] and if your bad guy is that you're reinforcing that stereotype so I'm not saying it is just saying
[957.94 → 963.72] it's a stereotype hold on careful okay uh so like I could see if is that starts becoming a problem for
[963.72 → 967.78] their marketing department right their marketing department might not might want to counter that
[967.78 → 974.52] but there's also good guys that are douchebags so like I don't think you're I don't I don't
[974.52 → 978.22] necessarily know that it accomplishes anything I don't know what the right answer is because honestly
[978.22 → 985.86] if it was me i I would probably care a little bit like when we distributed you know LTT water bottles and
[985.86 → 993.12] underwear and all that kind of stuff to influencers that's yours cool when we distributed a bunch of
[993.12 → 998.14] water bottles and stuff to influencers it's not like I went out and found people that I think
[998.14 → 1003.36] are buttheads and like had right but this isn't apple distributing the phones for the movies
[1003.36 → 1010.34] that's true this is this would be like you telling an influencer that you'll sue them if they use your
[1010.34 → 1017.44] water bottle that's true but I guess what I'm saying is if i have the ability to have my
[1017.44 → 1026.00] merchandise be in the hands and on the rumps of people that I think are cool yeah versus if it's
[1026.00 → 1033.66] on someone that I think is not cool I would definitely choose that sure not that i not that I actually think
[1033.66 → 1040.38] any of our viewers are stupid enough to think because some butthead we're actually oh
[1040.38 → 1049.74] okay maybe this matters more than I thought like think about supreme you see someone wearing a
[1049.74 → 1058.76] supreme hat for first thought go uh rich terrible with money douche okay, so maybe this matters
[1058.76 → 1065.76] I wonder if this is a policy that came about because apple had problems with it because you think about
[1065.76 → 1071.06] that's what I'm saying though is like if they recognize that perception like nowadays android
[1071.06 → 1077.90] phones cost as much or more than an iPhone but in the early days of the iPhone it was very
[1077.90 → 1087.62] expensive and like a status symbol that could have potentially been um utilized as a way to uh portray
[1087.62 → 1093.58] someone as snobby in a film so maybe I think that era is where that stereotype came from I don't really
[1093.58 → 1098.42] think it applies very well anymore I mean that would be when that would be like the early
[1098.42 → 1104.60] like 3gs 4 or 5 era kind of thing like, but that's when those types of things get established right
[1104.60 → 1110.72] interesting you know like one that I would bring up is in terms of like association that you don't ask
[1110.72 → 1117.82] for, and it goes really poorly is um I'm going to use words that sound like I'm not serious about it but
[1117.82 → 1123.56] it's just because I don't want the video to get in trouble um that pew thing that was really
[1123.56 → 1131.60] bad that happened in New Zealand yes he named PewDiePie yes and for some reason even though
[1131.60 → 1136.92] Felix had nothing to do with it all of a sudden there's this association so I'm not going to say
[1136.92 → 1143.56] our audience is dumb enough to do that, but people as a whole clearly have trouble differentiating
[1143.56 → 1150.40] between yeah and like I wouldn't really I don't to be very clear I don't care what they do because
[1150.40 → 1156.70] who cares what person uses a phone in a multi-million dollar movie production like yeah whatever give
[1156.70 → 1163.26] whatever I don't know it just it's so like i I can't imagine uh someone's stance on this where
[1163.26 → 1169.60] they're like infuriated in my movie everyone would use rotary phones nice I actually watched that would
[1169.60 → 1173.74] actually be hilarious I watched honey I shrunk the kids with my kids the other night oh man
[1173.74 → 1179.48] he's coming back for another one no yeah no, no seriously rick Morris is coming back yeah yeah
[1179.48 → 1186.44] uh I mean I wouldn't have picked the uh shrunk the kids franchise if I was to I'm pretty like hey Ricky
[1186.44 → 1193.32] come on back let's do a movie place rick Morris to make honey I shrunk the kids reboot after 23
[1193.32 → 1200.62] year break wow Canadian actor and oh my god this website is horrible look at this viewport
[1200.62 → 1206.02] what is this well your privacy is very important actually you know what it's okay when you click
[1206.02 → 1211.14] that it goes away but but but look at this look at this viewport I know just click you're okay
[1211.14 → 1217.30] with that it's okay it's okay no why would he come back with a reboot though does it like he did so
[1217.30 → 1223.60] much original stuff go away officially returning I'm actually I'm kind of jazzed though I'm gonna I'm
[1223.60 → 1230.02] going to go see that yeah well I just think that's really cool you know what that movie is extraordinarily
[1230.02 → 1236.50] poorly rated on like rotten tomatoes and stuff really yeah it's its funny seeing its funny reading
[1236.50 → 1245.16] critics reviews of kids movies that you watched when you were a kid right because you've got
[1245.16 → 1252.16] that nostalgia filter for it where you appreciated it for what it was a movie for kids whereas
[1252.16 → 1261.22] they're going in and talking about how the narrative flow wasn't this or the acting of the kids was
[1261.22 → 1268.40] not that or whatever and I'm looking at it going dude I was like six it was awesome what are you talking
[1268.40 → 1274.86] about okay, okay my kids loved it which is surprising given how out of date a lot of things inherently
[1274.86 → 1280.82] are about it like the idea that you would need an intercom in your house to talk to someone on
[1280.82 → 1289.60] another floor you know yeah just and that that was like a cookie oh high-tech idea you know okay
[1289.60 → 1293.36] business idea yes spoiled candy
[1293.36 → 1303.50] review waiting website review rating website just for kids movies and stuff not based on uh professional
[1303.50 → 1311.44] critics based on kids based on kids that just press the button as they leave the theatre did you just
[1311.44 → 1324.44] call it a theatre yeah cinema theatre yeah theatre cover up your Canadian show I don't know whatever
[1324.44 → 1332.46] but you just press the button I like it, and you could maybe even have like the attendant guy
[1332.46 → 1338.76] that's bored anyway at the theatre yes whatever just make sure that they don't like yeah yeah yeah
[1338.76 → 1342.66] but like you have to do something just press the button and that's all the input but are you allowed
[1342.66 → 1350.26] to collect data from kids would you even be allowed to collect that so this is why this is why kids
[1350.26 → 1371.26] don't know what to watch in the cinema yeah I like that one I'm going to call it that um but i I don't know maybe you have the parent present um but like I feel like that would be cool is that yeah that would be bad wouldn't it because that would be collecting data from kids
[1371.26 → 1378.76] that sucks that was a cool idea all right well I'm excited to see rick Moran has come back he's a Canadian
[1378.76 → 1385.68] treasure um he stepped back to take after uh take after to look after his family after his wife uh
[1385.68 → 1389.90] unexpectedly passed away if I recall correctly yeah and I really respected that decision, but it has also
[1389.90 → 1394.24] been 23 years so I respect this decision yeah I think that's cool I think his kids are probably
[1394.24 → 1401.24] slightly you know seven out of ten grown up at this point yeah or not in which case I guess
[1401.26 → 1407.38] he wasn't doing a great job anyway well that's not a nice thing to say but i i know nothing
[1407.38 → 1412.08] about his family life and that's been kind of the point is he's just gone completely dark the fact the
[1412.08 → 1415.64] fact that he made that move and the fact that he dedicated to that move makes me assume that he's
[1415.64 → 1421.80] probably i I respect it yeah I respect I'll be doing pretty good uh just like I respect my transition to

[1536.98 → 1545.98] there it is hey we got a wan show one now that's new oh I like it cool it's a little out of date and
[1545.98 → 1552.54] just in time for us to like to be like rip that logo uh okay so you know whatever the left hand's not
[1552.54 → 1557.36] talking to the right hand, but that's all good hey get it right away before I decide that that doesn't
[1557.36 → 1565.40] make any sense to have there and discontinue it uh so head to uh head to leg.GG slash display when
[1565.40 → 1570.86] use offer code LTT to save 15 today the show is also brought to you by private internet access you
[1570.86 → 1578.32] know what I'm really liking about my latest resolution for our VPN sponsor spots like we don't have talk
[1578.32 → 1583.94] we have talking points, but they're totally optional yeah Pia if you're a filthy pirate, and you don't want
[1583.94 → 1592.06] to get any letters from your ISP use Pia there you go it works it does exactly what you would think it
[1592.06 → 1599.62] does, and it's fast they've got over 3 000 servers in 32 countries no bandwidth caps EEE, and you can try
[1599.62 → 1603.96] it is risk-free with their seven-day money-back guarantee it's one of those things where I'm not
[1603.96 → 1609.64] going to promote that use case I'm just going to say that this product would work for that use case
[1609.64 → 1617.54] if you wanted it to um they've got their kill switch which allows the um they've got a kill switch
[1617.54 → 1621.66] which allows Pia to shut off your internet connection if the VPN becomes disconnected
[1621.66 → 1627.70] unexpectedly that way you won't accidentally leak out any of what you're uploading or downloading or
[1627.70 → 1632.82] accessing or whatever the case may be it also lets you access content from other countries as if
[1632.82 → 1637.08] you're from that country yes so that you can tell everyone that that's why you use it except Netflix
[1637.08 → 1642.92] Netflix has figured that out pretty good although which is hilarious because a lot of people still
[1642.92 → 1650.56] say that's why they use it even though it doesn't work um what's interesting is once ipv6 rolls out
[1650.56 → 1656.56] Netflix may not be able to block uh data centre IPS the way that they do now that's one of the reasons
[1656.56 → 1663.82] that they've held out for so long so once consumers start actually generating a significant number of
[1663.82 → 1669.20] complaints because they are on ipv6 because they can't get ipv4 addresses Netflix is probably going
[1669.20 → 1675.02] to have to switch to ipv6 and their current process where they just manually blacklist
[1675.02 → 1681.50] data centre IPS is simply not going to be tenable like yikes they will not be able to do that so
[1681.50 → 1689.46] I'm stoked because we had wanted to do the DIY VPN uh solution to accessing us Netflix that was kind of
[1689.46 → 1693.88] the intent behind that video and then I was really frustrated when I found out that unless you can
[1693.88 → 1701.52] deploy your VPN in a consumer's house um with a consume rip or a data centre one that has been
[1701.52 → 1707.44] white listed then you're done it won't work you might be able to do I mean this might not be the
[1707.44 → 1713.84] the greatest idea, but you might be able to do like hey have a friend in a different country we did talk
[1713.84 → 1721.46] about that okay yeah absolutely yeah so you know be a buddy be a pal you know um pay them 10
[1721.46 → 1727.36] bucks a month share a pipe yeah exactly share a pipe um man that would be a pretty easy way to get
[1727.36 → 1732.46] your internet connection paid for just find like five or six people overseas if you're an American
[1732.46 → 1736.86] find like a few people overseas that just want a VPN through your connection although depending what
[1736.86 → 1740.32] they do it could be I was just going to say you don't you have to trust them to a certain degree
[1740.32 → 1746.60] yeah, but you could yeah not never mind yeah so anyway LNG.GG slash Taiwan go check it out it's
[1746.60 → 1750.48] affordable you can use it on five devices at once with a single account, and we are going to move on
[1750.48 → 1757.22] to the rest of the show Microsoft drops the Xbox Series X tech specs, and they're actually looking
[1757.22 → 1764.14] pretty good but nothing really that unexpected yeah so they're confirming that the console's APU is using
[1764.14 → 1770.82] AMD really wants APU to take off don't they do they're still trying they're still trying i
[1770.82 → 1776.10] you know what love it that was a that was a misshapen heart let me see if I can do any better
[1776.10 → 1784.88] than that might have been more accurate though yeah it's like yeah perfect so the APU is you is using
[1784.88 → 1790.80] AMD's rdna2 architecture for the integrated graphics AMD previously disclosed that rdna2 would include
[1790.80 → 1796.86] hardware ray tracing functionality um the GPU alone will have 12 teraflops of computing power
[1796.86 → 1803.76] twice as much as the current Xbox One X okay I mean that's not that fast um that new horsepower
[1803.76 → 1810.74] will be used to drive frame rates up to 120 fps the new console will support HDMI 2.1 something that
[1810.74 → 1816.88] no consumer graphics card does yeah now I mean the console is not coming out for another eight months
[1816.88 → 1825.16] or whatever by that time I'm pretty sure NVIDIA's um 3000 series is going to be out uh okay variable
[1825.16 → 1830.46] rate shading will also be still a feature okay on the new console it is it's a good feature it is I'm
[1830.46 → 1836.52] I'm happy to see that that feature will be supported especially because even if this GPU is not going to
[1836.52 → 1843.58] run next generation games at like 8k 60 fps or whatever HDMI 2.1 means, and it'll have enough power
[1843.58 → 1851.76] to decode video for example HDMI 2.1 means that this will be f word future-proof for your 60 hertz
[1851.76 → 1857.22] 8k TV that you upgrade to down the line as content eventually rolls out, and it's nice that they're
[1857.22 → 1861.36] forward-thinking enough to put be pushing something that's going to be like very, very new at that time
[1861.36 → 1867.12] because people use these boxes for very long periods quick resume sounds pretty cool quick resume
[1867.12 → 1873.50] is sweet, so this feature saves the state of multiple games so that players can jump around in apps
[1873.50 → 1880.12] like they do on their phones very very very cool if you are like a kid or something in a family and
[1880.12 → 1885.38] you all share the Xbox, and it's like or if you're an adult in a family, and you share the console and
[1885.38 → 1892.90] it's not your turn that's right that's right you know it pretty much yeah I mean save states it's
[1892.90 → 1896.74] not quite the same as safe states where you could save it and come back to it later mind you so many
[1896.74 → 1901.32] games have auto save now that save states aren't really a major concern but I could see this being
[1901.32 → 1907.44] great for just like the kind of person who just kind of jumps around from one thing to another
[1907.44 → 1910.48] like if you're into single player games, and you're just like you know what that's enough Tomb Raider
[1910.48 → 1916.92] for now like I'm bored I'm going to switch over to you know I wanted to say uncharted wrong console
[1916.92 → 1923.20] um but yeah I can see that being an absolutely fantastic feature another thing is audio ray tracing
[1923.20 → 1929.38] okay, okay okay can everybody just chillax a little bit on the whole audio ray tracing thing
[1929.38 → 1939.64] audio ray tracing the feature okay, but the feature is described as rays that would broadcast from
[1939.64 → 1943.88] the character's ears and then be traced as they bounce off and interact with the environment
[1943.88 → 1955.72] okay this is called what was it EAX I think environmental audio extension hold on a second
[1955.72 → 1969.56] uh eax5 let's see voices processable pure path ah shoot hold on oh you know what I might be wrong
[1969.56 → 1978.72] I've heard it called this before creative might have never had an uh like an uh a ray traced
[1978.72 → 1986.36] style of audio uh bouncing I thought they did I've heard it called this not within the last bit I've
[1986.36 → 1992.10] heard it called this like year or two ago well I think that when AMD launched their Hawaii series of
[1992.10 → 2001.18] GPUs they were talking about this Hawaii GPU uh audio uh well I think VR works audio I'm trying to look it up
[2001.18 → 2007.36] right now I think VR works audio also works kind of the same way true audio is what AMD called this
[2007.36 → 2015.38] thing true audio AMD just trying to think GPU open true audio dedicated coprocessor oh yeah how'd that
[2015.38 → 2020.96] work out for you uh expensive advanced audio signal processing like convolution reverberation effects
[2020.96 → 2027.72] uh and 3d audio effects so NVIDIA was calling it path traced audio like a couple of years ago or a few
[2027.72 → 2034.52] years ago somewhere on their okay sorry we're like doing research for the show on the show but you guys
[2034.52 → 2041.32] knew what you were tuning into this happens uh creative path traced audio okay I was sure they did
[2041.32 → 2052.10] something with their like hardware audio processors like way, way back in the day um oh well i i I could
[2052.10 → 2057.28] be wrong I could be wrong yeah there was a Reddit thread there that said ray traced sound
[2057.28 → 2062.80] and it was an uh post from 2018 so it's its been yeah I don't know if there's been a super established
[2062.80 → 2071.30] term, but people seem to be sticking with ray Mr ray yep no one seems to uh no one's
[2071.30 → 2079.06] how does Linus still look straight out of 2008, but he still fly AF 100 hey I'm not 100 okay
[2079.06 → 2089.14] jeez um anyway that sounds super cool yeah I guess sure uh PlayStation 5 has been hinted at having
[2089.14 → 2095.16] this as well I wonder if it actually uses the same as some successor to true audio yeah uh although i
[2095.16 → 2101.06] thought they killed the true audio um processor on a subsequent GPU maybe they're bringing it back
[2101.06 → 2109.16] or something, or maybe they're just um doing it in compute yeah um slick wraps this was epic
[2109.16 → 2113.82] unbelievable you did you follow this whole thing did you read the whole article on medium I did not
[2113.82 → 2118.62] read the whole article oh man it was taken down uh it was probably mirrored somewhere but I didn't I
[2118.62 → 2123.16] got I found a mirror oh okay yeah if it was did it ever get put back up on medium
[2123.16 → 2130.48] not as far as I know oh interesting it might i I haven't been following this way too closely I looked
[2130.48 → 2136.54] into it a little bit kind of laughed and then moved on um leaks are so common these days like
[2136.54 → 2144.24] have I been pwned has so much stuff on it yeah this is hilarious, so slick wraps is a maker of vinyl skins
[2144.24 → 2149.46] for phones tablets and other electronics, and they announced last week that they suffered a data breach
[2149.46 → 2153.72] the announcement came after many customers received an email from slick wraps that appeared
[2153.72 → 2160.78] to be sent by a hacker who was inside their system claiming to have stolen customer data the person who
[2160.78 → 2165.96] sent this email said they learned how to access slick wraps data by reading a now deleted medium post
[2165.96 → 2172.42] by an individual that goes by the alias links 0x00 links claimed that the slick wraps phone case
[2172.42 → 2177.78] customization page had a vulnerability that allowed someone to upload any file to any location
[2177.78 → 2183.52] in the highest directory on their server um they said they used the vulnerability to access resumes
[2183.52 → 2188.24] of current and past slick wraps employees nine gigs of customer photos uploaded to the case
[2188.24 → 2193.70] customization tool all slick wraps admin account details including password hashes all current and
[2193.70 → 2198.28] historical customer billing addresses shipping addresses email addresses phone numbers and their
[2198.28 → 2203.40] customer transaction history they even had total revenue numbers for the company they had everything
[2203.40 → 2214.76] they even got access to the company's content management system um epic the best part is the Twitter dms so this um penetration tester
[2214.76 → 2224.60] attempted to reach out to slick wraps and get them to fix the issue starting with of course looking for a bounty which would be great
[2224.60 → 2233.38] and then eventually settling on you guys just need to like actually fix this slick wraps was as spectacularly unhelpful as they could have put it in the
[2233.38 → 2239.06] possibly bean um happy to help what's your order number are you looking for a bounty unblock me
[2239.06 → 2246.24] done then they say hello we're not looking for a bounty we're not looking for you to actively we're looking for you to notify your customers of the data breach
[2246.24 → 2254.80] blah blah blah etc etc etc, and they claim the account was run by a third party why are you doing this are you able to help we're just a social team
[2254.80 → 2266.16] okay, and then they just like blocked him so he said so oh yeah after this is great found the CEO's email by looking through the company records access through the vulnerabilities after sending the email
[2266.16 → 2274.54] he was blocked again by at slick wraps within three minutes like just the amount of trying oh sorry I wasn't screen sharing with you guys
[2274.54 → 2285.88] the amount of butt covering that was going on here was just amazing so did he um inform them before this
[2285.88 → 2292.30] yes post so that's that's really the crazy thing to me so if you run anything on the web
[2292.30 → 2297.98] you will very likely at some point in time be contacted by someone, and they're going to go oh hey
[2297.98 → 2305.54] uh I noticed you should probably update these things they're not great you should probably do that
[2305.54 → 2310.46] like immediately yeah or at least like look into it and make sure they're not baiting you into a zero-day
[2310.46 → 2315.58] or something like that like just do a little bit of research make sure it's not nefarious but like
[2315.58 → 2323.12] there's a lot of people out there that are really, really good at stuff, and they will often try to help
[2323.12 → 2328.74] you, and it's very, very nice when they do so don't just like block them and treat them badly
[2328.74 → 2335.62] because they probably all already know how to screw you over so be nice like I don't I don't understand
[2335.62 → 2342.70] how that's difficult logic to comprehend i just uh I don't know they're they're doing you a really
[2342.70 → 2351.94] big favour here's the here's the archived uh medium article payment gateway logs in the cms at this point
[2351.94 → 2359.92] I could have deleted their entire company um so they sent them a couple tweets uh the first
[2359.92 → 2366.04] one was less um obtuse than that like it was a little bit more specific yeah looks like your
[2366.04 → 2371.16] customers aren't happy so they posted this as like a screenshot they took from the internal system
[2371.16 → 2374.86] and then slick wraps tried to reach out being like oh what's the problem with your case
[2374.86 → 2384.68] it's like not that like the whole thing is just so much fail, and they went back, and they went in and
[2384.68 → 2388.64] they were trying to fix things internally, but they just fixed it all wrong they didn't fix the actual
[2388.64 → 2395.84] exploit that was allowing this um penetration tester to do whatever they wanted yikes okay
[2395.84 → 2405.34] well rip slick wraps I suppose um once again I have dodged a bullet uh to my yeah I don't think
[2405.34 → 2411.32] we ever worked with slick wraps' oh, oh I see yeah I think we were a brand shop from uh from day zero so
[2411.32 → 2421.00] yay good job but like I just want to call attention to like the sheer amount of data
[2421.00 → 2427.94] breaches and remind people to just try to uh this is haveibeenpwned.com i this website's actually
[2427.94 → 2433.92] pretty awesome yeah troy Hans amazing yeah he runs it really cool setup um like you, I mean, and you can
[2433.92 → 2439.86] see slick wraps accounts right here, but there are also lots of other breaches this is recently
[2439.86 → 2445.96] added, and it has one for like 2016 but I'm assuming an adult friend finder pretty epic 100 and
[2445.96 → 2452.34] okay those can't all be real there's no way I love how we finder had 170 million users
[2452.34 → 2456.74] I love how real I do love how it's 169
[2456.74 → 2464.68] does adult friend finder exist I used to see banner ads for it all the time back before
[2464.68 → 2472.80] like banner intelligently targeted people yeah um i I have no idea I do my favourite one was that
[2472.80 → 2479.04] was that uh cheating on your partner website Ashley Madison yes yeah that was hilarious when they got
[2479.04 → 2483.96] breached and like people had to have some real awkward conversations yeah I wonder how many
[2483.96 → 2489.30] relationships ended because of that breach I don't know I would say probably a significant like
[2489.30 → 2495.68] surprisingly quiet right afterwards which I found interesting um but yeah there 's's tons of
[2495.68 → 2500.16] breaches all the time update your passwords all over the place yeah um because you don't want like
[2500.16 → 2507.94] your uh I don't know your Reddit account to get breached and then allow that to make it so that
[2507.94 → 2512.72] people can get into your bank yeah or something like that so just try to separate your
[2512.72 → 2519.98] accounts get a password manager split everything up use 2fa I have a big announcement okay tickets for

[2629.26 → 2633.74] note in there because some people might be like whoa the BYOC plus pass is like real expensive
[2633.74 → 2639.94] getting faster internet in one of these situations is real freaking expensive and very important
[2639.94 → 2645.96] yes if you forget to download some like you know let's say for example Call of Duty modern warfare
[2645.96 → 2652.92] download that before you come yeah i actually uh like I didn't get into that game so the first time

[2668.00 → 2673.56] on well how many Blu-rays would that be we'd be going back to remember when far cry came on five blue
[2673.56 → 2679.10] uh five uh CDs that'd still be easier to manage we'd be back to that they have uh multi-layer
[2679.10 → 2682.68] Blu-ray desk is there one big enough they could hold that no I think you'd go up to a hundred right
[2682.68 → 2686.90] I can't remember you'd have to get two hasn't been relevant for a while day zero patches anyway
[2686.90 → 2693.44] what can I do for you sir did you figure out the list of that you were confused by the oh yeah we did
[2693.44 → 2698.16] we're just saying it's just really dumb yeah I didn't see it before it went up and VIP pass shouldn't
[2698.16 → 2702.06] look different from all the other ones why is it in the middle of the thing and just looking
[2702.06 → 2706.10] different than I thought that was a category I didn't even like I didn't see it before it went up
[2706.10 → 2712.68] yeah so let's get change it let's get those this looks great yeah that looks awesome yep that whole

[2748.72 → 2751.84] okay we should probably figure that out before Friday
[2751.84 → 2754.62] if you can afford a VIP ticket it probably doesn't matter wow
[2754.62 → 2760.22] well I'm just saying some people save up because they like you Linus I don't think they like me
[2760.22 → 2765.12] I don't think they like me, they just want an excuse to harass them in person can't be right
[2765.12 → 2771.52] can't be right um also we I think we talked through the confirmed guests last year, but we do have some

[2913.62 → 2919.22] that actually hasn't been updated in a little bit i I plan to blow as much money as I can on
[2919.22 → 2926.26] bringing creators to Ltd so anyone who is willing to come um assuming that like they have enough of
[2926.26 → 2932.04] a following that people will like to recognize them there that's sort of my bar um hey it doesn't
[2932.04 → 2936.06] cost anything to reach out, and we can see what we can do for you there is a finite amount of money but
[2936.06 → 2941.36] i I want to make sure that this is like the gathering for the tech creator community
[2941.36 → 2945.44] do you know David and I went scuba diving together oh hardware Canucks just confirmed
[2945.44 → 2950.42] oh that's cool I just heard from them so they're going to be there uh you and uh David Emil yeah oh
[2950.42 → 2955.08] really cool he's a nice guy yeah we were hanging out at computer, and we were discussing like what
[2955.08 → 2959.86] we're doing afterwards and I talked about how like I was going south in Taiwan I was going to go scuba
[2959.86 → 2966.76] diving, and he was like sure, and it was actually really fun he's a pretty chill dude yeah it was dope
[2966.76 → 2973.48] that was a very fun little vacation thing I've actually got one more announcement as well okay
[2973.48 → 2982.36] carpool critics is getting a YouTube channel not getting carpool critics has a YouTube channel yeah
[2982.36 → 2989.28] so we just launched it so we're hoping to have a hundred thousand subscribers within the first
[2989.28 → 2996.46] couple of hours just like how we do you know this can be the first button that you use for
[2996.46 → 3000.50] the case that's probably a bad idea you probably want to keep that one so the last four episodes
[3000.50 → 3007.90] were uh betting on the Oscars featuring Brandon um sonic the hedgehog uh the matrix so like an
[3007.90 → 3014.58] it's its going to be a mixture of new stuff old stuff um this so they did spirit away the matrix
[3014.58 → 3021.30] sonic the hedgehog and uh Brandon I don't know if all of them are here but Brandon oh sorry
[3021.30 → 3027.36] Brandon the Oscars thing with Brandon oh yes so the first one it only goes back to uh episodes from
[3027.36 → 3032.20] about two months ago, but knives out which is the movie we're actually talking about earlier in the
[3032.20 → 3037.40] show is one of them in here that one was pretty good I haven't I haven't it says surprise the best movie
[3037.40 → 3041.44] of the year and then that's the thumbnail I haven't seen knives out yet I hope it's great I hope
[3041.44 → 3047.56] it's so great that he never returns to anything related to Star Wars that's that's what I hope
[3047.56 → 3055.24] ouch, ouch I wish him the best of luck with anything unrelated to Star Wars sick burn all right last big
[3055.24 → 3064.46] topic of the day this was posted originally on Engadget this car apparently can be driven
[3064.46 → 3071.26] without a license and costs just 22 a month so does it get classified as like a scooter
[3071.26 → 3079.58] I think that has to be what's going on here tiny two-seater um as long as you are 14 years old in
[3079.58 → 3085.34] France or 16 in other European countries it's called the Ami, and you do not need a license five and a
[3085.34 → 3090.00] half kilowatt-hour battery under the floor 44 miles on a single charge you can plug into any standard 220
[3090.00 → 3097.28] bolt outlet it only goes up to 28 miles an hour so yes you can only really this is basically like
[3097.28 → 3107.00] a glorified power wheels yeah it's like power wheels for big kids yeah um and that seems pretty cool
[3107.00 → 3114.48] because I mean if you were already able to rip around on your electric bicycle which fundamentally
[3114.48 → 3120.52] is a motorcycle if we're being honest what difference does it make if you're ripping around
[3120.52 → 3127.26] on your electric thing with four wheels and like you're more protected from rain yeah I don't I don't
[3127.26 → 3133.28] see the difference here I think it's pretty cool it's like crazy like I'm I'm amazed that regulators
[3133.28 → 3140.14] allowed this because for some reason we've just we've always had this this this line how many wheels
[3140.14 → 3149.74] doesn't happen hold on a second here yeah yeah that's bad yeah no, no more of that so uh 20 euro per
[3149.74 → 3157.26] month for a long-term rental of two years with an initial down payment of 2900 us dollars or 2644 euro
[3157.26 → 3163.66] that's a bit of a down payment you can also buy it outright for six euro six thousand six thousand euros
[3163.66 → 3173.18] that is pretty cheap depending on the kind of yeah so if you're never going to go on a highway because
[3173.18 → 3181.00] you can't yeah um that's probably fine and that might actually be a perfect I don't know if uh
[3181.00 → 3185.24] kids in Europe want me to encourage this, but that might be a perfect solution for some parents
[3185.24 → 3191.02] here's your car you can't go on the highway, and you can't go very far you can't go very far
[3191.02 → 3195.86] so have fun driving around very locally I will always know where you are
[3195.86 → 3202.72] you know what it's funny like I would have hated it when I was a teenager but like some of tesla's
[3202.72 → 3207.38] features for example that allow parents to put it in kid mode and like to limit the speed and know where
[3207.38 → 3214.14] they are and stuff like that I am super into that for when my kids are teens like I had a sports car
[3214.14 → 3221.00] convertible my parents probably I think calling that a sports car it's technically a sports car I think
[3221.00 → 3226.62] it is technically a sports car just like the pt cruiser is technically a truck okay so guys this was
[3226.62 → 3234.38] his car look that up if you want it's funny okay wait no oh wait no you didn't have a gunfire what was it
[3234.38 → 3246.40] uh bird was it sun bird okay whatever yeah yeah I think that was it yeah
[3246.40 → 3253.04] that's pretty close it's not I don't think that's exactly it, but it's pretty close what
[3253.04 → 3259.54] this is so useless i I do you remember when you give me the old google images yeah do you remember
[3259.54 → 3264.46] when you could just click on the picture and end up looking at the picture, so mine was that mine was
[3264.46 → 3273.48] three years older than this is actually newer this is the one I rescued him from the bridge
[3273.48 → 3280.54] because it like blew up in the middle of the bridge if you want to go watch amazing content on
[3280.54 → 3286.40] my YouTube channel that I haven't uploaded anything to in four years right it is there um Luke it got
[3286.40 → 3291.96] the first dislike it ever had by us sharing it on this show oh really yeah I still haven't uploaded
[3291.96 → 3298.12] any more uh here it is here it is uh, so this is the video you know what don't copyright strike me
[3298.12 → 3307.36] please oh that's a brilliant idea no I won't do that so this is Luke uh having people drive around him
[3307.36 → 3313.14] on the bridge uh into Richmond oh man
[3313.14 → 3321.28] dude this worked though and I had the radio on, and they even talked about how like it was actually
[3321.28 → 3327.66] working because I was at just before the crest of the bridge so you could see me like way down
[3327.66 → 3331.62] the road, so there was actually like you can see traffic is actually flowing pretty good and there's
[3331.62 → 3336.54] a huge gap behind me because people are splitting way ahead of time, and it was actually yeah it was
[3336.54 → 3345.62] it was going okay yeah um why did I how did I get there so fast mortar bike oh that's oh yeah that's
[3345.62 → 3353.90] right never mind okay uh, uh I mean I got there in a perfectly reasonable amount of time that was
[3353.90 → 3359.42] back when uh you know why did I need to be there you're a little quick BCAA oh that's right I have a
[3359.42 → 3363.88] BCAA membership, and you don't and like as long as you were physically there yes then they would tow
[3363.88 → 3369.50] it for nothing yeah that's right why do you get to piggyback why do you get to piggyback on all my
[3369.50 → 3370.02] stuff
[3370.02 → 3377.44] you're on my Google play music that's great I'm sure you're on at least something else
[3377.44 → 3382.40] probably there's got to be at least something else you're probably like on my Pia account and I don't
[3382.40 → 3388.46] even realize because I only use it on like one device for a long time but I'm not anymore but i
[3388.46 → 3395.72] still probably because you got it for free yes you work here sort of yeah oh man you are the
[3395.72 → 3404.50] the biggest cheapskate of all time hey man all right don't hate the something whatever you know don't
[3404.50 → 3409.80] hate the player I don't know if you can call me a player you are a player you're playing you're
[3409.80 → 3414.70] straight playing hey you get three or something right and you probably didn't use the other
[3414.70 → 3419.88] ones yeah you get five you get five yeah there's no way you used all those no I didn't actually
[3419.88 → 3426.46] all right wow you guys are doing a pretty good job like quadrupled the size yeah we've got over
[3426.46 → 3431.44] we've got over a thousand subscribers on carpool critics go check it out anyway uh let's go through
[3431.44 → 3439.12] some super chats ladies and gentlemen yeah oh yeah good there's not that much um
[3439.12 → 3445.00] YouTube you're going to get Jacob that would that billy Eilish one's actually pretty funny uh poor
[3445.00 → 3455.52] billy Eilish banned from iPhones she's got a song called bad guy oh i I'm officially old so the only
[3455.52 → 3465.70] the only reason that I have any idea who billy Eilish is the only reason is that I saw the memes
[3465.70 → 3473.22] from the Oscars okay that's it or was it the Oscars Grammys something doesn't matter my girlfriend
[3473.22 → 3482.36] is a ridiculously huge fan of the office yeah, and apparently she is and the guy that plays Dwight
[3482.36 → 3488.44] did like an interview thing with her, and it was all over my YouTube suggested probably because my
[3488.44 → 3499.86] girlfriend okay so anyway um I'm officially old yeah I had no idea who she was I have never heard
[3499.86 → 3505.76] one of her songs I know this for a fact because like apparently she's amazing so I guess I'd remember
[3505.76 → 3512.12] it um I watched I know this is like super cliché modern YouTube content whatever but I watched a
[3512.12 → 3518.68] pastor watching her music videos, and it was actually hilarious oh really yeah why are they super edgy or
[3518.68 → 3525.86] something they're they're pretty like they're they're very uh dramatized they're they're very uh
[3525.86 → 3534.60] uh like how do I say this reaction provoking YouTube videos like one of them she has like black like
[3534.60 → 3540.34] ink stuff like pouring from her eyes and stuff like they're they're relatively intense I would say
[3540.34 → 3547.50] I don't know okay there are some pretty yeahs that one okay it gets a little weird um neat you'll
[3547.50 → 3555.28] definitely get claimed if you play this no, no I'm oh wow shoot that there you go fixed it okay um
[3555.28 → 3561.34] but yeah I don't know, and his reactions were just funny he was cool with it it was it was
[3561.34 → 3567.40] actually just a was actually a very wholesome video in the end yeah it's later on I think it's right
[3567.40 → 3574.62] about yeah okay that's some cool effects yeah but I actually thought it looked pretty sweet
[3574.62 → 3583.48] they ran tubes down and then like make-upped over them and stuff wow that's really cool I don't know
[3583.48 → 3588.96] i it's kind of I'm not trying to defend myself I don't listen to her music I don't know why I know
[3588.96 → 3594.54] all this stuff but I do wow that has half a billion views that's probably why I know wow neat
[3594.54 → 3602.36] cool I think we should go through the wrestling before you get in trouble yep, and it wouldn't
[3602.36 → 3608.58] be wrong uh Emory says my first super chat does a small partition with a lot of rights on a SSD
[3608.58 → 3612.86] wear out faster than a neighbouring big partition with fewer rights' no because the SSD dynamically moves
[3612.86 → 3619.08] around which flash cells it's using addressable locations instead of moving to Thomas says hey
[3619.08 → 3620.50] Linus and Luke what's your favourite tech
[3620.50 → 3623.24] Xbox

[3626.72 → 3629.72] lttstore.com
[3629.72 → 3638.74] I don't know um all of it right like that's the whole idea uh Thomas says I like this show and the
[3638.74 → 3641.24] flaws with a smile is what gives it character
[3641.24 → 3645.84] that's pretty good
[3645.84 → 3648.42] flaws with a smile thanks Kai bear
[3648.42 → 3653.72] um Nicholas says is there somewhere we can buy that gold on black water bottle
[3653.72 → 3657.14] I'm glad you asked lttstore.com
[3657.14 → 3658.46] I think we're out of stock right now
[3658.46 → 3658.92] oh
[3658.92 → 3661.34] uh yeah we're waiting for more stock
[3661.34 → 3665.88] I was saying nick we should have ones that you can read the name and stuff
[3665.88 → 3669.08] because on the wan show from far away it just looks like a black water bottle
[3669.08 → 3670.22] okay
[3670.22 → 3673.32] and i I purposefully drink from them every show
[3673.32 → 3678.28] Vítor says could you elaborate about what happened on that T-Mobile video it felt really out of place for LTT
[3678.28 → 3683.66] 5g is cool and all but the video was awkward well what happened was we shot a video
[3683.66 → 3688.32] and the whole idea was like it was going to be like timely and around the Super Bowl
[3688.32 → 3694.98] and then um it wasn't and so by the time
[3694.98 → 3698.02] uh the video was actually going to be released
[3698.02 → 3702.52] some of the things that were said in the video were like kind of weird and random
[3702.52 → 3710.38] like uh the original uh recording of the video included me alluding to the potential merger
[3710.38 → 3711.68] between sprint and T-Mobile
[3711.68 → 3717.16] which like four days after we shot so before we could have finished editing it was confirmed
[3717.16 → 3722.98] and then the most hilarious part is that we weren't even able to include that part in the video
[3722.98 → 3728.08] because of concerns that if we were speculating about it
[3728.08 → 3733.40] in a sponsored by T-Mobile piece of content that maybe that would be bad in some way
[3733.40 → 3736.34] but then by the time it went through it wouldn't have mattered I could have just said
[3736.34 → 3742.86] using uh using sprints mid-band this strategy is going to make it so that there's kind of a
[3742.86 → 3747.10] the best of all worlds approach to 5g on T-Mobile's network that's really cool it's going to take
[3747.10 → 3751.32] some time to roll out it's more about the future uh the thing about that video is people are super
[3751.32 → 3758.70] mad um but most of what people are mad about as far as I can tell is not actually anything that was
[3758.70 → 3765.34] in the video is full of factual information about 5g and T-Mobile's network and
[3765.34 → 3771.42] their competitors network uh because I would never upload something that wasn't to the best of my
[3771.42 → 3778.78] knowledge even if it is sponsored words that I believe um I didn't watch it but everything they
[3778.78 → 3785.28] just said makes sense there's a lot of energy around anything that says 5g on it these days and
[3785.28 → 3789.64] anything sponsored and there's a lot of negative energy around both of those things in some cases
[3789.64 → 3794.36] but like a lot of what people were mad about is like you're not even addressing the like
[3794.36 → 3801.54] the the the fact that 5g is a weapon of course not because that's stupid
[3801.54 → 3810.88] like all I can do is talk about what it is i I can't, I can't address everything that it's not
[3810.88 → 3818.04] it's its not going to turn your skin blue like do you need me to say that um
[3818.04 → 3824.24] so technically not proven yeah technically not proven thank you for that Luke that's
[3824.24 → 3829.84] perfect I'm thankful that you're here as my co-host today in this trying moment
[3829.84 → 3839.20] so yeah I mean the thing is people are super mad a lot of people are misunderstanding
[3839.20 → 3844.04] it's its hilarious because and Yvonne even told me she was like I don't think that your intro to the
[3844.04 → 3848.70] video where you start out by saying I want to address some of the questions or misunderstandings
[3848.70 → 3853.50] people had last time she was like I think that was a bad foot to lead off on, but that was the video
[3853.50 → 3859.54] like that's what I was trying to do and in spite of me going straight at that like directly hey guys
[3859.54 → 3868.18] this misunderstanding that low band 5g is the same as low band 4g that's not correct
[3868.18 → 3873.96] and yet people are like you didn't even address that it's using the same bands, and it's the same thing
[3873.96 → 3881.70] yes, yes I did and no they are not the same thing and no there is not going to be an immediate benefit
[3881.70 → 3887.80] where you should run out and throw away your 4g phone which I literally said in the video, but it's
[3887.80 → 3894.20] more about what's coming down the pipe I also didn't say go and buy you know these 5g phones that don't
[3894.20 → 3898.24] have full support for all the different bands I specifically didn't say that because that would be bad
[3898.24 → 3904.44] advice unfortunately in the video I say wait for the upcoming Samsung devices that support all the
[3904.44 → 3909.86] bands unfortunately by the time the video came out those devices were already announced so it just
[3909.86 → 3917.32] made no sense so I have an extremely off-topic question yes locally in chat they want an ups update
[3917.32 → 3923.32] oh um Von do you want to give us the ups update um well we have to get the mic's over here
[3923.32 → 3926.00] oh man I'm
[3926.00 → 3932.64] it can hear it can, you can just stand near yeah um just project like to get a little closer you're
[3932.64 → 3940.02] nowhere near the frame okay so we have to cut a hole into that wall, but it's a load-bearing wall so
[3940.02 → 3947.00] we need an engineer to look at it, we need to get permits and even then the new ups is longer than
[3947.00 → 3952.30] the old one so we actually have to cut two holes into that room so we got to figure that out
[3952.30 → 3959.54] oh it's a work in progress that sucks so we're going to make a video about it including um so with
[3959.54 → 3965.04] eaten the manufacturer of the one that blew up and the manufacturer of the one that we are replacing it
[3965.04 → 3971.12] with showing sort of what we did right what we did wrong and uh how to make sure that your ups doesn't
[3971.12 → 3976.58] also blow up um, so thanks for tuning in guys uh that's it for the wan show today we'll see you
[3976.58 → 3982.50] again next week same bad time same bad channel we actually considered doing same bad time same bad
[3982.50 → 3989.14] channel on the uh on the shirt, but that's not what I've been saying I well i could lie and say
[3989.14 → 3993.36] that's what I've been saying all this time that would be funny all right see you guys bye
[3993.36 → 3999.12] okay, okay I need to make sure I end the YouTube event this time because in much the same way that
[3999.12 → 4006.00] the YouTube stream doesn't start so you press it yes so you have to end it in so you have to end the
[4006.00 → 4013.52] YouTube stream in the YouTube dashboard then end obs that would make my snowboard streams a lot easier
[4013.52 → 4020.16] yes because a big problem with them is when I go on the back side of the mountain I lose signal
[4020.16 → 4023.74] when I'm on the near side of the mountain I actually have perfect signal all right and
[4023.74 → 4029.70] then it just tanks we lose signal mainstream turn off bye oh wait hold on uh thanks DAX
