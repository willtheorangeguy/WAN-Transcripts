[0.00 --> 10.80]  ladies and gentlemen and we're live welcome welcome to the wang show oh man i have been
[10.80 --> 15.92]  streaming a lot today but that's okay because i'm having fun i might even stream some more later oh
[15.92 --> 24.88]  boy this is great timing yes my son what can i do for you you want to sit here no absolutely no way
[24.88 --> 32.48]  not only are you not only are you gigantic and heavy now but it is freaking hot in my house so
[32.48 --> 38.88]  i still have all my insulation pulled out because i am wiring up a whole bunch of security stuff
[38.88 --> 45.04]  i'm putting in new wireless um i'm going to be putting in air conditioning but that's the problem
[45.04 --> 50.16]  right see the air conditioning it's not in yet so i have no insulation which means that on a hot day
[50.16 --> 57.44]  the sun on my roof is just radiating heat into my house and the air conditioning that is supposed to
[57.44 --> 63.44]  deal with problems like having too much heat in your house um is not in there so now did i actually
[63.44 --> 67.68]  tell you the story yet about what happened with the air conditioning no okay well we can talk more about
[67.68 --> 74.40]  it later but basically i ordered the wrong thing twice oh oh yeah oh yeah classic classic big oof
[74.40 --> 80.40]  moment there yeah big oof egg f on my face let's go ahead and uh talk about what we're going to be
[80.40 --> 86.80]  talking about today so this is a rumor slash leak there's enough rumors circulating that it kind of
[86.80 --> 93.52]  seems like this might be credible at this point but uh basically it looks like there might be new
[93.52 --> 98.96]  xt models of the third gen ryzen cpus coming out which would be pretty exciting for people who like
[98.96 --> 104.24]  faster processors for the same amount of money what else we got here uh pewdiepie has informed me
[104.24 --> 110.16]  that i need to begin lifting to complete my transformation to chad linus uh duly
[110.16 --> 116.64]  know that felix do you know it yeah no that makes sense with the beard what else we got okay uh
[118.00 --> 124.88]  i don't know um texas instruments is banning some program on ti-84 calculators because of tests or
[124.88 --> 129.60]  something okay no this is actually kind of a big pain in the butt i bet that was added to the doc by alex
[129.60 --> 133.36]  because he's probably super mad basically it means you can't run assembly code on them anymore
[134.24 --> 143.28]  yeah i i just we'll get more i i strongly disagree with why they did this but we'll get more into
[143.28 --> 149.84]  that later um and spacex launch was delayed we're a little we're a little no it's gonna be a great show
[149.84 --> 154.08]  i'm not even gonna go where i was going because usually when we're late on news we're going to
[154.08 --> 158.72]  other stuff anyways and the show ends up being better so it's gonna be a fantastic show it's gonna
[158.72 --> 181.76]  be a fantastic show yeah all right let's roll that intro oh wait i gotta go grab something
[181.76 --> 195.76]  okay sorry about that i'm back wow i barely recognize myself on the wan show without my big
[195.76 --> 202.80]  old headphones now okay i gotta tell you an embarrassing story luke okay are you ready
[202.80 --> 209.20]  okay so uh i just mentioned that my insulation is all cleared out of my attic because i'm doing
[209.20 --> 214.56]  a bunch of wiring up there right yeah so one of the things that i'm doing is ethernet wiring for
[214.56 --> 221.92]  wireless access points security cameras all that kind of stuff um i don't have a ton of experience
[221.92 --> 227.04]  making my own ethernet cables because in most cases it really does just make more sense to just buy them
[227.04 --> 231.12]  as long as you know what length you're going to need having an extra you know six feet and coiling it up or
[231.12 --> 236.40]  whatever is not only cheaper but it can also be more reliable because then you're not counting on
[236.40 --> 241.04]  your own you know homemade crimped connections you're counting on a factory that presumably does
[241.04 --> 247.76]  this for a living to do everything properly um anyway over the last little bit i've been doing
[247.76 --> 253.28]  enough of it that i've like kind of gotten the hang of it though until last night i set a goal for
[253.28 --> 258.32]  myself to do one security camera install per night so that there's just kind of like a limit to how much
[258.32 --> 262.32]  crawling around in my attic that i have to do on it on a daily basis but also so that the project
[262.32 --> 268.00]  will get done at some point and last night i got home after a really frustrating day at work really
[268.00 --> 277.04]  infuriating i was just trying all i wanted was i wanted a cpu to output enough heat that um i could
[277.04 --> 283.76]  evaluate thermal compound um like a bunch of different thermal compounds so i just wanted to
[283.76 --> 288.16]  consistently output like a decent amount of heat and you don't want it to be just a little bit because
[288.16 --> 295.28]  then it becomes hard to tell if it's just uh um you know if there's like a two degree difference
[295.28 --> 300.08]  it's hard to tell if that's just a two degree difference in you know test runs or if that's a
[300.08 --> 304.96]  two degree difference in thermal interface performance so if you can be at 80 degrees instead
[304.96 --> 309.92]  of 40 degrees that two degree difference at 40 degrees might be four degrees at 80 degrees and you're
[309.92 --> 313.12]  a lot more confident that one solution is truly better than the other that's all i wanted i want
[313.12 --> 320.24]  a cpu to get hot and i couldn't do it i couldn't do it couldn't make a cpu hot no matter how i tried
[320.24 --> 327.44]  uh i just there were some some idiosyncrasies of the amd fx 8150 that i didn't remember in my defense
[327.44 --> 333.36]  that was like 10 years ago and i couldn't get it to heat up without throttling and um anyway i had a
[333.36 --> 337.92]  really frustrating day got home and i was like okay i'm just gonna put up i need to feel like i
[337.92 --> 344.32]  accomplished something today so i put up a security camera and i was running the ethernet cable for it
[345.52 --> 362.88]  one okay okay two three hold on gotta start holding these differently okay four five six what seven
[362.88 --> 366.96]  eight eight what
[370.08 --> 376.72]  why i don't even know if this is all of them i had to re-crimp the connectors on this run it's and it's
[376.72 --> 383.28]  like the stupidest thing ever because it's like a i don't know 15 foot run it's the it's the camera
[383.28 --> 389.76]  right here and my server room is on the other side of this wall it's it's such a short run um i had to
[389.76 --> 394.16]  redo it eight times and i'm like standing up on my desk and it's like hard because i don't have a ton
[394.16 --> 400.00]  of slack and i have less and less slack every time and it was one of those things where i was just so
[400.00 --> 409.12]  angry and so exhausted and um what i did was i i had already done it like four times or so and
[409.12 --> 412.88]  yvonne steps and she's like do you want me to try one and i'm like you've never even like done this
[412.88 --> 418.40]  before i don't honestly think that's gonna help she comes in she's like well i can follow instructions i'm
[418.40 --> 422.64]  like that's true you are very good at following instructions like she is so meticulous whereas
[422.64 --> 426.16]  like i'll kind of like gloss over something like yeah yeah i said i mostly know what's going on here
[426.16 --> 429.92]  and then i'll you know i'll get eight more steps in oh crap i have to undo everything now because i
[429.92 --> 435.20]  missed something she never does that she's like the queen of following instructions so she follows
[435.20 --> 439.84]  the instructions she has trouble with some of it because her fingers just aren't like aren't that
[439.84 --> 446.88]  strong so like straightening the wires and like like bending the like bending the these things over
[446.88 --> 452.72]  because you need to lift and and yvonne needs to do uh yeah finger strengthening exercises it is kind
[452.72 --> 457.04]  of hard like it is kind of hard to get them perfectly straight especially when you consider that she
[457.04 --> 461.68]  didn't have a lot of extra to work with so she couldn't just like take off an inch and a half and
[461.68 --> 466.40]  use that to have better leverage right like no no there's a reason for it anyway so she she does it
[466.40 --> 473.20]  she goes through and um finally she she did it all properly and i was like they're supervising watching
[473.76 --> 479.44]  and it still didn't work and i was like okay well i'm back to back to putting on more connectors so i
[480.64 --> 484.96]  went back to the other side i did it again so now i had yvonne's side on this side of my side there and
[484.96 --> 489.36]  it still wasn't working and so she's like googling she's like you know should you crimp it fast should
[489.36 --> 494.48]  you crimp it slow should you you know do you use the load bar you know those load bar things that
[494.48 --> 498.56]  you're supposed to put the wires in she's like do you do it the other way and we did find an illustration
[498.56 --> 501.76]  where someone was putting it in the other way and i was like that's stupid that makes no sense you should
[501.76 --> 504.88]  obviously put it in this way because this way helps you sort them in this way is just dumb
[505.44 --> 510.16]  and we found you know more she found more resources that confirmed that yes in fact that is the right
[510.16 --> 515.12]  way to do it she's like doing all this research and finally she's like she's just so methodical this is
[515.12 --> 524.08]  why we're so good together because when it comes to like sort of just raw dragon energy like i'm i i i am
[524.08 --> 531.04]  like a more wild like creative thinker but when it comes to you know focusing that dragon energy you know i
[531.04 --> 536.24]  need her you know i really do she comes along she picks up all the ends that i've done she's like
[536.24 --> 539.44]  are you sure you're doing them right i'm like yes i'm sure i'm doing it right there's a diagram
[539.44 --> 544.96]  right on my crimping tool there's no way that i could be doing them wrong out of these eight
[546.80 --> 550.00]  five of them are backwards
[550.00 --> 560.16]  so there it is that one it's kind of hard to see but it's brown on this side instead of orange on this
[560.16 --> 567.36]  side so what was happening was i was consistently because of the angle the cable was coming in at
[567.36 --> 574.88]  and because my brain was addled i was consistently wiring up one side correctly and the other side
[574.88 --> 584.00]  incorrectly oh i was so painful and meanwhile i'm trying to figure out okay am i am i not getting
[584.00 --> 588.40]  the loading bars in deep enough are they not actually getting the cables uh you know right up
[588.40 --> 596.72]  where the crimping thing comes down am i um yeah am i crimping like too fast or too slow or like like i'm
[596.72 --> 602.32]  i'm trying to find i'm trying to do a rain dance right when the answer is you just gotta you know get some
[602.32 --> 610.24]  sleep and wait for the weather to change yeah wow that's pretty great yeah so i immediately
[610.24 --> 617.04]  she solved it then though well she solved it she solved me being an idiot right like she was like
[617.04 --> 622.16]  hey you're an idiot and i was like cool but like she she figured out like look these previous ones were
[622.16 --> 626.96]  wrong yeah i know i know you said you had five that were wrong but i didn't know yeah yeah oh yeah
[626.96 --> 633.28]  no immediately after so the really frustrating thing was like i didn't think to check the order
[633.28 --> 639.20]  of the wires because it was like kind of working so i was getting power i could see in my ubiquity
[639.20 --> 644.72]  like controller dashboard that i was getting power to the device but i wasn't getting any data and i was
[644.72 --> 651.20]  like come on why am i getting power no data how could it be i even asked this out loud before she gave
[651.20 --> 656.96]  me the answer i said how could it be that i am so consistently getting the power wires connected
[656.96 --> 670.16]  and not the data ones so you like kind of knew yeah well i just couldn't i just couldn't uh all
[670.16 --> 677.28]  right why don't we jump into our first tech topic of the day uh wccf tech sources confirm what there's
[677.28 --> 686.40]  cpu news three new ryzen matisse refresh cpus dubbed xt models so uh ash river posted this on the
[686.40 --> 692.32]  forum and they claim that sources have confirmed amd is prepping three new ryzen 3000 desktop chips
[692.32 --> 699.76]  as part of a matisse refresh and i gotta say on paper this looks credible simply because it just like
[700.72 --> 708.08]  kind of makes sense all these skews make sense the 3950x i can see why they wouldn't refresh that
[708.08 --> 715.60]  it's a relatively low volume part and it's already like 16 cores it's kind of like binned balls to the
[715.60 --> 721.76]  wall right whereas the 3900x yeah maybe there was a little bit of room to play in there 3800x maybe a
[721.76 --> 730.64]  little bit of room to play 3600x same thing so these are um excuse me six eight and 12 core models
[730.64 --> 738.16]  that look like they should be getting small bumps to both their uh no not both anything small bumps
[738.16 --> 745.84]  to their clock speeds well base and boost and what's cool about this is that if the pricing comes in at
[746.48 --> 753.68]  just a little bit higher than the existing 3600x 3800x or 3900x or if it comes in the same actually
[753.68 --> 756.80]  that's what i'm predicting i'm predicting they're going to come in exactly the same
[757.76 --> 761.36]  my love i can't help you with your lego thing right now i'm sorry you'll have to grasp on me
[761.36 --> 767.20]  um it makes a ton of sense because if these come in at the same pricing all of a sudden these x skews
[767.20 --> 772.72]  that amd has kind of struggled to demonstrate the value of because they allow overclocking on the
[772.72 --> 779.36]  vanilla ones as well as the x ones all of a sudden their performance will be significantly enough
[779.36 --> 787.20]  different at stock speeds that if the x's just went away the vanillas could stay the xt's could stay
[787.20 --> 791.36]  and there'd be this substantial performance difference between them that hasn't really
[791.36 --> 796.80]  existed up until now and it would also mean that on all the benchmark charts when people go and review
[796.80 --> 803.20]  these cpus compared to intel's 10th gen amd would look much more favorable for the next few months
[803.20 --> 810.80]  while they're preparing um the uh fourth generation uh zen process uh verizon processors okay sweetheart
[810.80 --> 812.56]  you can't be hanging around on the back of the camera off you go
[816.32 --> 821.68]  all right so they're rumored to say uh so in terms of the speed increases we're not talking about anything
[821.68 --> 830.64]  extreme so the 3600x is 3.8 gigahertz base 4.4 boost we're looking at 4 gigahertz base 4.7 boost
[831.28 --> 836.32]  that's pretty decent it's nothing to sneeze at either that's five percent at base
[836.32 --> 840.32]  and a little bit about seven and a half whatever that works out to boost
[842.00 --> 849.52]  that that's like that's that's quite the chunk like your your boost clock is is going to on the 3600xt
[849.52 --> 856.96]  is going to higher than the 3900x yes it's an interesting way to look at it that's pretty sick
[856.96 --> 863.36]  and so we're looking at kind of similar boosts so around anywhere from 200 to 300 megahertz boost
[863.36 --> 870.64]  across the board here on the base clocks and anywhere from yeah 200 to 300 megahertz on boost clocks
[870.64 --> 875.92]  as well and what's really cool about the position that amd is in right now and like what a privileged
[875.92 --> 879.92]  position it is they've they've worked hard for it to be clear i don't mean that kind of privilege i mean
[880.56 --> 887.36]  just the you know basking it guys is that they don't have to shoot first and then hope their
[887.36 --> 893.68]  competitor doesn't have an answer yeah yeah amd was able to sit with their existing lineup with the
[893.68 --> 900.32]  vanillas and x's and wait for intel to make a move intel made a move they launched 10th gen with
[900.32 --> 905.92]  solid performance some surprises in terms of performance i was expecting them to run hotter
[905.92 --> 909.92]  than they did but they actually shaved the die i don't know if you watched our review of it luke
[909.92 --> 914.96]  they actually shaved the die down to get better thermal transfer between the die and the and the
[914.96 --> 920.96]  integrated heat spreader anyway intel managed to launch with better performance and better thermals
[920.96 --> 926.08]  than i was expecting but the power consumption is huge so what that means is that assuming that amd has
[926.08 --> 930.24]  done any refinement on their seven nanometer process over the last six months or however long
[930.24 --> 936.56]  it's been since ryzen third gen launched they're in a position to you know make a tweak if they need
[936.56 --> 941.12]  to but they didn't need to move first so now they know what they're up against so they can go okay
[941.92 --> 946.72]  knowing what we're up against if we need to increase the power envelope of these chips a little bit
[947.68 --> 952.64]  we can do that if we don't need to do that well then we'll go a little bit less aggressive so they
[952.64 --> 958.56]  can sit tune this stuff release it um they can dictate the pricing really because intel's pricing
[958.56 --> 965.04]  is already out there um i think this seems pretty likely if this rumor had come out and said that
[965.04 --> 970.16]  there was going to be like a top to bottom refresh i just said no that makes absolutely no sense i i
[970.16 --> 978.96]  don't see it happening but this looks very credible yeah absolutely and exciting i like these kind of
[978.96 --> 987.76]  these clapbacks um it it it feels kind of i don't know i like them right now because like you said
[987.76 --> 992.96]  the bask in your glory kind of situation where like they're they're finally in the lead so i'm happy that
[992.96 --> 998.32]  they're doing this i also don't like them when this happens from the team that's been in the lead for an
[998.32 --> 1003.92]  extremely long time so i don't know but right now i'm happy this is happening so you're just
[1003.92 --> 1009.28]  very cool you're just an underdog kind of guy are you luke are you an underdog with those types of
[1009.28 --> 1017.68]  moves yes because when it happens from a company that has been in the lead for a super long time
[1017.68 --> 1023.76]  yeah they're just kind of suppressing competition at that point where when it happens from a team
[1023.76 --> 1030.08]  that's been in the lead for a relatively short amount of time they are kind of finally reaping the
[1030.08 --> 1035.60]  rewards for their gains you know what i mean right it feels different um i see what you mean so you
[1035.60 --> 1041.28]  mean kind of like the relaxing and waiting for the other guy to make a move that i don't like right
[1041.28 --> 1047.12]  okay okay okay but i mean okay in fairness to amd it's not like they've relaxed for a long time here
[1048.16 --> 1053.92]  no we're talking about months not years yeah and that's why this that's a big part of why this feels
[1053.92 --> 1060.32]  kind of fine right um yeah so i've got a comment that might upset you a little bit here from uh
[1060.32 --> 1068.72]  horlocks over on twitch luke i am your father come back to retail wow and learn to pvp we can make a man
[1068.72 --> 1074.64]  out of you yet first of all quote incorrect the rest i don't really care about
[1074.64 --> 1084.72]  that's true so many people quote it that way it doesn't say luke i am your father yeah yeah it's no
[1084.72 --> 1091.36]  no i am your father all right by the way another twitch chat thing they want a lego stream they want
[1091.36 --> 1096.00]  a lego stream oh do they know my kids are do they know my kids oh right because one of them was over
[1096.00 --> 1102.16]  here asking for help with lego uh yeah i don't know i mean the stuff they build actually you know what
[1102.16 --> 1110.48]  sure why don't we hey guys can you bring over a couple of the things you built are you disappointed
[1110.48 --> 1118.00]  by their creation no no their their creations are great they're just they uh okay lego movie 2 you
[1118.00 --> 1125.52]  know the like like the weird stuff that it gets built yeah okay thanks darlin i kind of thought you
[1125.52 --> 1131.12]  might bring over something a little bit um more impressive than this they have bigger stuff so this is
[1131.12 --> 1139.84]  a thing uh what is this exactly this is a drone oh okay that's oh wait wow why do you know what a
[1139.84 --> 1148.56]  drone looks like yeah how futuristic of them okay so they've each got a drone what kind of game are
[1148.56 --> 1154.40]  you guys playing you need drones no no i know you're playing lego but like why you need what do you need
[1154.40 --> 1160.00]  drones for to help to help with what our buildings are too big the buildings are too big so oh oh are
[1160.00 --> 1168.32]  they building drones yeah this is gonna be my giant spider okay this is gonna be a giant spider cool
[1169.92 --> 1178.08]  this is this is a dolphin um driving a car with plants growing out of the back of it so that's good
[1178.08 --> 1185.84]  this is the eco warrior mobile yeah um and this what is this car well i see it's a car but what's
[1185.84 --> 1192.56]  special about it he doesn't know okay all right thanks guys the buildings are too big to bring all
[1192.56 --> 1202.00]  right thank you sure why not you want you want more like streamlined thing i i don't know i just i i
[1202.00 --> 1209.36]  i you know for me if like you got this like mishmash of different colors i kind of get uneasy you know
[1209.92 --> 1213.76]  oh sorry i knocked a piece off there i'm sorry there you go there's your tail lights you got your
[1213.76 --> 1218.64]  tail lights so the tail lights color match at least so that's good oh yeah at least it's not illegal
[1218.64 --> 1226.16]  all right youtube is deleting comments with a couple of phrases that insult china's communist party now
[1226.16 --> 1235.52]  this hopefully seems like it was sort of um not as big of a deal as it initially seemed to be but
[1235.52 --> 1241.04]  let's walk through the the timeline here so this was posted by ash river over on the forum and curiously
[1241.68 --> 1246.00]  the earliest source we were able to find maybe you guys can correct us if we're wrong here
[1246.56 --> 1251.36]  i'm sure there's one before it maybe there's one before but palmer lucky was one of the earliest
[1251.36 --> 1258.32]  person people persons people talking about this in a tweet from may 25th that has uh 30 000 likes
[1258.32 --> 1265.76]  just about youtube has deleted every comment i ever made about the wumao about excuse me the wumao
[1265.76 --> 1271.04]  and internet propaganda division of the chinese communist party who at google decided to censor
[1271.04 --> 1275.84]  american comments on american videos hosted in america by an american platform that is already banned
[1275.84 --> 1281.12]  in china anyway this appears to be a new global policy at youtube not directed at me specifically
[1281.36 --> 1286.24]  try saying anything negative and then he posts the chinese characters or even mentioning it at all
[1286.24 --> 1290.00]  your comment will last about 30 seconds and get deleted without warning your notice
[1292.88 --> 1298.32]  interesting pretty crazy so yeah okay i found i found at least one one source from before it but
[1298.32 --> 1304.96]  most sources are from are from after it um so yeah do you want to run us through this one what what went
[1304.96 --> 1311.28]  down here it i don't i don't necessarily know there's been an update from youtube yep
[1311.28 --> 1318.00]  um that they they said they it is confirmed they they confirmed that it is happening and they are
[1318.00 --> 1326.56]  working on a fix it seems like why it's happening wouldn't be hard to fix right like you you run a
[1326.56 --> 1333.68]  video platform how hard do you think it would be to fix the amount of stuff that's ran by ai on okay that's
[1333.68 --> 1343.20]  fair youtube is pretty extensive so i don't i can't claim to know like how this came to be um i i think
[1343.20 --> 1350.88]  it's really interesting i don't i don't know enough about this at all i don't think youtube has directly
[1350.88 --> 1355.60]  sorry one sec i don't think youtube is directly addressed like how it came to be at all maybe they
[1355.60 --> 1361.12]  did if i missed that i'm sorry but this could be a really interesting story as we see it develop because
[1361.12 --> 1367.44]  there's there's updates as of like fairly recently um if an outside source was able to train an ai
[1368.00 --> 1372.96]  okay so there's a couple things here so first of all let's talk through why this phrase uh might be
[1372.96 --> 1379.76]  banned in the first place it translate to translates to communist bandit or 50 cent party not that 50 cent
[1379.76 --> 1388.88]  like um and what's weird is that the romanized opinion and english language translations are not affected
[1388.88 --> 1396.08]  so uh communist bandit was a term used by nationalist forces during the chinese civil war and wumao or 50
[1396.08 --> 1400.96]  cent parties a derogatory slang for internet users who are paid to direct online discussion away from
[1400.96 --> 1407.04]  criticizing the chinese communist party so basically uh shills and they're called so because they're paid
[1407.04 --> 1413.92]  50 chinese cents per post um curiously you know what was happening was even if the phrases were used
[1413.92 --> 1418.64]  positively they were being scrubbed suggesting that youtube spam and offensive text filters may have had the
[1418.88 --> 1424.48]  phrases added to them although by whom and whether accidentally or for what purpose is not currently
[1424.48 --> 1432.96]  known um youtube is as was pointed out in in palmer's tweets completely blocked in china so the
[1432.96 --> 1438.96]  censorship is just a little bit confusing uh youtube has confirmed in an update that this is an error in
[1438.96 --> 1443.84]  their enforcement systems and they're working to fix it as quickly as possible but they're as far as we know
[1443.84 --> 1449.92]  have been no further details given as to what the error is or how it crept in in the first place
[1450.56 --> 1458.16]  that specifically is the part i am so interested in so jay js wiseton in the youtube chat says well
[1458.16 --> 1462.96]  why does youtube have that infrastructure in place anyway why is youtube helping a horrible communist nation
[1462.96 --> 1469.84]  censor its citizens well that's probably not what they're doing and they have comment moderation tools
[1469.84 --> 1477.44]  in place because users like you and youtubers like me want them i do want a degree of moderation in
[1477.44 --> 1482.16]  my youtube comments and you could say well oh you're anti-free speech but that's not actually what free
[1482.16 --> 1490.56]  speech is yeah uh it's part of you know my right it's part of my rights to dictate on my video what is or is
[1490.56 --> 1495.84]  not permitted and i'm allowed to have things like banned words because that's not what free speech is free
[1495.84 --> 1500.72]  speech is the the right to speak freely and criticize the government not the right to say whatever you
[1500.72 --> 1506.56]  want on somebody else's youtube video that's it's not the same thing and so they have tools for moderation
[1507.12 --> 1515.36]  just the question is how exactly would this phrase have ended up there and you know seeing some of the
[1515.36 --> 1520.72]  things that are being done with ai now luke you see that project where nvidia recreated pacman oh yeah
[1520.72 --> 1527.12]  we talked about it on wanshow right did we nvidia recreated pacman no i don't think we did okay cool
[1527.12 --> 1534.08]  so nvidia had an ai just watch i think it was like 50 000 hours of pacman being played and then it
[1534.08 --> 1541.60]  recreated the game just by learning the rules from watching someone play which is pretty amazing and so
[1542.72 --> 1550.48]  if you had a chat ai for example or if google had an ai that crawled other platforms because
[1550.48 --> 1555.60]  you know especially moderating i think it's fair to say that most google headquarters employees
[1556.16 --> 1560.64]  english would be their first language and so moderating other languages would be a real challenge
[1561.52 --> 1566.32]  and that's something that you have to find a solution for so it's not entirely outlandish to
[1566.96 --> 1572.96]  say that it's possible that one of google's solutions might be to create an ai that monitors
[1572.96 --> 1580.40]  chats and comments on websites where people speak these languages natively and look for phrases or
[1580.40 --> 1587.04]  words that seem to cause consternation among the community that's not entirely unrealistic i'm not
[1587.04 --> 1592.16]  saying that's how they're doing it i don't know how they're doing it but that would be a way for that
[1592.16 --> 1599.04]  to realistically end up in a in an offensive words filter does that seem reasonably credible luke
[1601.12 --> 1605.60]  yeah um it would probably mostly use their own platforms but yeah
[1605.60 --> 1611.20]  yeah but it does it does definitely seem credible but they could use other platforms and they could
[1611.20 --> 1616.64]  and they could and they could have actually ended up with that in their offensive words filter even
[1616.64 --> 1621.84]  on their own platform because the thing about uh you know the thing about the chinese communist party is
[1621.84 --> 1628.72]  even within china a lot of people think that oh you know chinese people are somehow uh you know
[1628.72 --> 1632.80]  equated like the views of the chinese communist party somehow align perfectly with the people in china
[1632.80 --> 1638.24]  there's over a billion people in china not all of them agree with what the chinese communist party
[1638.24 --> 1643.92]  does so there's a lot of dissent that gets created in china over things like the hong kong protests or
[1643.92 --> 1651.76]  over things like these these these 50 cents uh these 50 cent party shills that are trying to you know
[1651.76 --> 1659.36]  steer online discourse in ways that are more favorable to the ccp um so it's not entirely unrealistic to think that
[1659.36 --> 1665.12]  in chinese language comments on youtube videos and you know let's be realistic there's lots of people
[1665.12 --> 1672.08]  in china watching youtube lots they don't show up in my you know demographic information in my analytics
[1672.08 --> 1678.88]  dashboard because they're all on vpns but they're watching i can tell because i get emails and like
[1678.88 --> 1684.24]  forum private messages and stuff like hey i was i got one today someone was like hey i was browsing
[1684.24 --> 1688.64]  taobao as i'm apt to do because i'm chinese and live in china and i saw your face on there just thought
[1688.64 --> 1693.84]  you'd like to know these guys are using this picture of you to like sell this product it happens
[1693.84 --> 1700.00]  all the time so we have to go and like either you know try and get it taken down or whatever
[1700.00 --> 1703.84]  i remember we went through a really funny thing with gpd do you know those guys
[1705.20 --> 1712.00]  uh i think so they make like handheld gaming pcs like x86 gaming pcs anyway super nice guys from my
[1712.00 --> 1717.92]  dealings with them but they we went through a bit of a thing with them where they uh used a ton of
[1717.92 --> 1723.44]  imagery of me on their product page in a way that made it seem like i was somehow associated with the
[1723.44 --> 1727.68]  product or had and they had like a bunch of quotes so almost like i they're taken out of context almost
[1727.68 --> 1733.28]  like i was like i helped develop it or something i was like hey you guys need to not do that that's
[1733.28 --> 1739.36]  actually not okay and you can't um you need to just take your own product photos and stuff without
[1739.36 --> 1744.00]  my face in them and they were fine they were chill about it we actually have a review coming for their
[1744.00 --> 1749.84]  new product the gpd win max very soon the thing is freaking cool it's really cool uh it's got
[1749.84 --> 1755.04]  thunderbolt it's like this big uh it's got a quad core eight thread cpu in it that turbos over three
[1755.04 --> 1762.00]  gigahertz and moderate loads like it's unbelievable anyway um we run into that a lot so i'm just saying
[1762.00 --> 1768.72]  that i'm not letting youtube off the hook but i'm also not necessarily gonna go full tinfoil hat they're
[1768.72 --> 1776.00]  you know clearly suppressing uh you know chinese descent here yeah to me to me it seems like
[1776.72 --> 1783.76]  either just an over ambitious auto moderator or potentially a little bit of outside steering
[1783.76 --> 1788.64]  of an over ambitious auto moderator but i i kind of doubt it was it was manually done
[1789.84 --> 1797.12]  uh pretty one simtan says enough politics please i mean i honestly wish
[1797.12 --> 1805.28]  i wish that when we had to discuss you know the internet uh or net neutrality or uh moderation
[1805.28 --> 1812.64]  of comments on internet platforms i wish that wasn't a political topic i wish that the right and left
[1812.64 --> 1820.00]  and center and every possible political affiliation had the common sense to reach a common understanding
[1820.00 --> 1826.56]  about these things it's not tech people that politicized this stuff it's political people
[1826.56 --> 1832.56]  that politicized very obvious tech solutions to tech problems in many cases and that leads us
[1832.56 --> 1839.04]  perfectly actually into our next topic um so the president sorry sorry sorry
[1840.00 --> 1846.32]  oh uh the the president of the united states signed an executive order targeting some of the protections
[1846.32 --> 1851.60]  that exist for social media companies and really any website that relies on user generated content and
[1851.60 --> 1858.48]  this is something that affects me and luke directly uh through the linus tech tips forum and through
[1858.48 --> 1867.20]  floatplane so basically it seems to be in response to a recent moderation uh action on the president's
[1867.20 --> 1874.32]  twitter feed where fact check warnings were applied to some tweets about mail-in voting and then there was
[1874.32 --> 1884.32]  actually another one today where um a tweet that uh seemed to suggest that riots would be met with uh lethal force
[1885.04 --> 1894.24]  um was hidden as one that contains inappropriate content for the platform that would normally be taken down
[1894.24 --> 1901.28]  but was left up because it was in the account of a political figure so twitter does have a special carve out
[1901.28 --> 1906.56]  for political figures where they will leave things that would be taken down for anyone else because they
[1906.56 --> 1919.52]  are considered to be important information uh even if they are against um twitter's policies so this uh this
[1919.52 --> 1926.72]  comes after years of complaining that social media was targeting uh conservative voices um the new executive
[1926.72 --> 1934.96]  order is hoping to address this let's talk a little bit about what this might mean so basically what
[1934.96 --> 1942.48]  they're going after is the protections that exist for online platforms um to not be responsible for the
[1942.48 --> 1948.24]  information that is posted on their platform so the argument being made here is that okay twitter if you're going to
[1948.24 --> 1959.28]  editorialize then you should be a publisher rather than a platform um it is a fascinating debate and one that
[1959.28 --> 1964.40]  is honestly best left to the legal scholars but i can tell you right now what the implications are for
[1964.40 --> 1972.80]  users of platforms like youtube twitter floatplane facebook etc if you make these platforms responsible for
[1972.80 --> 1978.00]  everything that's posted on them which is effectively what would happen if they were switched to being
[1978.00 --> 1983.04]  publishers so basically what's being done is a line in the sand is being drawn either you guys can
[1983.60 --> 1992.72]  edit nothing and we can just leave misinformation about um you know miracle covid cures um we can just leave
[1992.72 --> 2000.80]  everything there or you can try to you know in this in this in some cases you know what i'm not even going to weigh in on this
[2000.80 --> 2006.24]  case in some cases protect your users from that kind of dangerous misinformation and you can end up
[2006.24 --> 2012.64]  responsible for everything that's posted on your platform so what will happen is small upstarts something
[2012.64 --> 2019.28]  like a float plane that doesn't have the resources to police every post that is posted like imagine if
[2019.28 --> 2024.40]  i told you tomorrow luke you guys have to build a well effectively a comment moderation ai that's going to
[2024.40 --> 2030.48]  make sure that um you know nothing that we could be held legally liable for is posted on the platform
[2030.48 --> 2036.32]  you'd basically tell me to go take a long walk of a short pier i think shut her down i uh there's
[2036.32 --> 2043.84]  there's stuff that isn't that hard word filtering is not that hard um and what we could potentially do
[2043.84 --> 2052.64]  in that scenario is just word filter to the end of the earth and just like word filter everything
[2052.64 --> 2058.40]  basically so that you you could basically only say like good video
[2060.96 --> 2067.20]  thumbs up and that's like all that's allowed on the platform yep um but but like to to properly
[2067.20 --> 2071.44]  filter all this stuff like you you can see the amount of work that google and facebook put into
[2071.44 --> 2076.56]  it it's it's wildly different and it's more than just uh you know misinformation there's things like
[2076.56 --> 2083.68]  hate speech that would be that could contain lots of words that are fine but um a message that's not
[2083.68 --> 2088.88]  okay yeah and that's extremely difficult to detect and they're they often work on that kind of stuff
[2089.84 --> 2095.92]  i wouldn't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole but it like a bunch of people in twitch are posting
[2095.92 --> 2105.12]  good video thumbs up uh thanks uh but yeah i i don't i don't want to do that um luckily float plane is a
[2105.12 --> 2110.08]  uh pay access platform so the comment sections are often fantastic yeah it makes our lives a lot
[2110.08 --> 2118.88]  easier we like automatically don't have this type of issue which is great thumbs up but yeah sprite xp
[2118.88 --> 2123.12]  brings up another great point because this is another potential outcome here is uh they say well
[2123.12 --> 2128.24]  how would this executive order help wouldn't twitter just ban trump completely then well yeah well that's
[2128.24 --> 2132.80]  exactly what you'd have to do any user who has the potential to cause problem for you you would have to
[2132.80 --> 2138.64]  to completely get rid of them like that would if there were to actually be some kind of law drawn
[2138.64 --> 2144.08]  up around this you would have to include some kind of provision where you have enough time to react to
[2144.08 --> 2151.76]  something that is reported and get rid of the user luke is gone um it would be great if we had luke back
[2151.76 --> 2157.92]  sometime soon he just disappeared while we were while we were in the middle there you know good stream luke
[2157.92 --> 2163.84]  uh thumbs up thanks um maybe what i'll do is just oh hey he's back but we don't have video yet so i'm
[2163.84 --> 2168.16]  gonna just hold on a second luke i'm gonna go through a couple more little things here um it's
[2168.16 --> 2172.88]  funny that you mentioned the effort that facebook's putting into this stuff because um twitter came out
[2172.88 --> 2178.24]  and said that the company will this is a quote continue to point out incorrect or disputed information
[2178.24 --> 2183.20]  about elections globally and that this does not make twitter an arbiter of truth as they've been
[2183.20 --> 2187.68]  um accused of being going on to say that the intention is to connect the dots of conflicting
[2187.68 --> 2192.56]  statements and show that information in the dispute or the show the information that's in dispute so
[2192.56 --> 2197.52]  people can judge for themselves i think that's a pretty fair approach to it facebook uh ceo mark
[2197.52 --> 2201.84]  zuckerberg said facebook's approach is different than twitter's he stated i just believe strongly that
[2201.84 --> 2206.64]  facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online which is basically as far
[2206.64 --> 2212.48]  as i can tell facebook's way of saying we would really like to take political advertising money from
[2212.48 --> 2220.00]  everyone we are an equal opportunity um sucker of money from from all entities and we just don't
[2220.00 --> 2227.68]  ultimately give a crap so thanks for that facebook love it not surprised um let me go through our
[2227.68 --> 2233.20]  sponsors while luke tries to fix his video feed or do you have any ideas going on i think i'm good it
[2233.20 --> 2241.68]  should be fixed okay uh well i had a i had a power fortification in my house and my ups saved me from
[2241.68 --> 2246.48]  everything going down but certain devices aren't plugged into it so enough stuff went down that
[2246.48 --> 2252.08]  it was bad all right wow that's pretty cool what just happened there kids make sure you have a ups
[2252.72 --> 2257.36]  yeah i'm just gonna go through our sponsors real quick anyway so let's go ahead and talk to you

[2486.56 --> 2491.92]  i got this it's live unboxing live unboxing ladies and gentlemen thank goodness there it is it's a chi
[2491.92 --> 2496.40]  charger all right pretty standard stuff tanker so it's good stuff just bad packaging okay
[2496.40 --> 2499.52]  there
[2502.32 --> 2505.60]  back to the show fantastic fantastic oh
[2507.60 --> 2516.32]  so lifting i think it's time pewdiepie called me out today and he's like basically you know nice beard
[2516.32 --> 2522.64]  chad linus but uh you need to start lifting i don't know if you guys i don't know if you guys are aware
[2522.64 --> 2529.12]  of this but pewdiepie over the last uh i don't know i guess probably it looks like it clearly
[2529.12 --> 2535.04]  didn't happen overnight um so it must have been while he was while he was away uh hold on a second
[2535.04 --> 2542.80]  let me just create a new source here chrome there we go look at that what got absolutely like what is
[2542.80 --> 2552.56]  what is beyond cut beyond shredded like sliced you know he got sliced i guess slice has kind of like
[2552.56 --> 2559.44]  a plastic surgery connotation to it uh my minor issue minor issue why can i not find this yeah
[2559.44 --> 2565.20]  no he's he's ripped i think he needs to you know maybe bench press a little bit more to even it out
[2565.20 --> 2574.00]  but he's freaking wow all right wow that's how you're gonna be i think i think there's a there's a very
[2574.00 --> 2580.88]  clear transition here is he deleted twitter and just got ripped so you're saying i should delete twitter
[2581.60 --> 2587.60]  yeah you know what i don't even i don't even mind it uh anyway so so in his meme review video today a
[2587.60 --> 2592.08]  meme of me came up and he like completely derailed the whole thing and was like hey have you guys
[2592.08 --> 2596.16]  noticed like mine's like chad lines now he's got a beard and all he needs to do is start lifting okay
[2596.16 --> 2603.60]  so i will have you guys know that i might not be quite that cut but i'm not as bad as he might think okay
[2603.60 --> 2612.72]  so instead of instead of instead of the the like tech and nerdy and gaming youtubers boxing you guys
[2612.72 --> 2618.00]  could just have like a lifting competition i wouldn't win that i wouldn't win that i've been
[2618.00 --> 2622.72]  i've been pretty lazy over the last couple of months it looks right now like he would definitely
[2622.72 --> 2628.32]  he would he would definitely i think i think i'd get i think i'd get beat up pretty bad right now but uh
[2628.32 --> 2635.04]  you know what i had my first badminton session since uh since quarantine on monday i am excited
[2635.68 --> 2643.20]  uh my my butt i could barely walk for two days but um i'm i'm going back to going back to the gym on
[2643.20 --> 2649.28]  tomorrow going back to the gym tomorrow i'm going to be playing twice a week um uh the family has gotten
[2649.28 --> 2653.84]  kind of into bike rides lately so i'm that's going to be my leg day is uh getting out and cycling for a
[2653.84 --> 2663.12]  bit it is oh man it is tough bike riding man and yes i'm riding with my eight-year-old son
[2663.84 --> 2673.60]  but in my defense i have a trailer okay with two girls in it my daughters not like that uh so i've
[2673.60 --> 2680.08]  got what is it about a what do you what do you girls weigh no forget it doesn't matter i think
[2680.08 --> 2685.20]  between the two of them they're about 80 pounds though so i've got this steel trailer and 80
[2685.20 --> 2691.20]  pounds worth of water effectively plus everyone's water bottles and stuff behind me it is unbelievable
[2691.20 --> 2698.88]  going up a hill on with that behind me yeah oh i uh a couple things one might get a little bit of
[2698.88 --> 2703.60]  trouble for the pewdiepie picture apparently forgot there's like rules on twitch and stuff
[2703.60 --> 2712.48]  uh oh really oh yeah i guess technically those shirts off oh whatever yeah what's twitch gonna
[2712.48 --> 2718.72]  do ban me like why would would i even care they could just get more ripped yeah they could ban me
[2718.72 --> 2724.40]  for they could ban me for six as much as six days and i wouldn't even notice like pewds streams on
[2724.40 --> 2728.24]  youtube now he doesn't he doesn't stream on twitch he doesn't stream on whatever that other platform he
[2728.24 --> 2732.72]  used to stream on was maybe that's part of the reason why he's ripped yeah i don't know maybe maybe you
[2732.72 --> 2737.28]  need to not stream on not stream on twitch i think you're getting your correlation and your causation
[2737.28 --> 2746.56]  confused maybe maybe maybe i i've moved on to expert plus on beat saver really yeah i'm still i don't
[2746.56 --> 2753.20]  i'm not like destroying expert song but i want things to go faster all right all right and i'm beating
[2753.76 --> 2762.64]  most expert songs right away now okay i don't have like the and i have two two excuses for some of my
[2762.64 --> 2767.44]  scores on expert songs one of them is that i'm still having some amount of controller sync issues
[2767.44 --> 2772.16]  i've figured out there's a mirror on the wall back here that you guys can't see it's over there yeah
[2772.16 --> 2776.96]  and we started covering the mirror with like a towel and that has made things a little bit better
[2776.96 --> 2783.12]  also i have big sliding glass doors over there and we have started pulling the blinds there both of
[2783.12 --> 2791.28]  those things combined have massively helped but um faster songs i think my computer's like oh
[2792.96 --> 2799.68]  you know what is funny is i made a comment a little while ago um while i was filming a video and one of
[2799.68 --> 2805.68]  the one of the people uh at work i forget who it was but they mocked me because i said that i'm i'm
[2805.68 --> 2812.96]  extremely sensitive to controller tracking and latency problems because when you're playing beat saber at that
[2812.96 --> 2820.00]  level even a very very small issue is a big problem you basically can't hit anything uh because it's a
[2820.00 --> 2824.96]  rhythm game right and um especially if you're trying to get good scores and you're trying to get clean
[2824.96 --> 2829.52]  cuts right down the middle of the block you don't have a lot of time to react and they mocked me they
[2829.52 --> 2837.92]  were like beat saber hardcore gamer yeah right yeah it's a thing i uh i i've noticed on i was trying to do
[2837.92 --> 2845.36]  this this one expert plus song yeah um and i was actually doing i i i put it on no fail so i could
[2845.36 --> 2851.60]  see the whole song yeah and there's there's essentially two hard parts and i'm i was able to
[2851.60 --> 2858.00]  make it past the first one yeah um but then like halfway through the second one i was starting to fail
[2858.00 --> 2865.12]  and it felt weird everything felt sluggish and like i was like i don't think this is me could have been
[2865.12 --> 2869.76]  that leg could have been that leg like i'm not i'm not sure i went back to caramel dancing and it was
[2869.76 --> 2875.20]  all perfectly fine yeah then i go back to that song it feels sluggish again and then i had my my
[2875.20 --> 2881.36]  girlfriend sit down and like watch my monitor while i was playing with the latency checker thing and when
[2881.36 --> 2887.92]  i get into that song the latency goes up to over 17. you know what you should check is um i noticed by
[2887.92 --> 2894.96]  default that beat saber cranks the anti-aliasing and super sampling just get rid of it oh yeah because they
[2894.96 --> 2901.04]  they have a tremendous performance impact sometimes and it's not always consistent even from like
[2901.04 --> 2904.72]  one time booting the game to the next i found so i just turned both of them completely off
[2905.44 --> 2914.08]  i'll try that i'll try that it's just the the like 17 plus ms is not fun oh no yeah like ranges up
[2914.08 --> 2919.20]  and down while you're playing too so like it'll it'll be fine during the like easy part of the song
[2919.20 --> 2926.08]  and then the hard part of the song hits and it's like 17 plus it's so annoying might be might be
[2926.08 --> 2933.76]  time for a cpu upgrade man maybe it's it feels like cpu but yeah maybe well i'm gonna i'm gonna
[2933.76 --> 2938.88]  mess with the settings we'll see what i can do sure uh i had another uh i had a chat here that i wanted
[2938.88 --> 2944.64]  to respond oh yeah right another thing is uh david from work was telling me that he figures if he
[2944.64 --> 2948.56]  trained up a little bit he's good enough at guitar hero that he could like take me and beat saber
[2948.56 --> 2953.68]  like yeah sure yeah sure maybe i'll stream later maybe i'll stream later guys all right let's see
[2953.68 --> 2962.96]  if we've got any other tech topics for today uh uh ah yes this was posted by the last millennium on
[2962.96 --> 2968.64]  the forum okay we we can we can go into that there's part of the pewdiepie lifting thing that
[2968.64 --> 2973.84]  we didn't go over though oh what was it the we talked earlier in the stream i said if you if
[2973.84 --> 2979.44]  you do want to start lifting once this code thing is slightly past i would totally go with you i
[2979.44 --> 2985.68]  find it so boring i hate it i like to play games you know i like to i like the only way that i can
[2985.68 --> 2990.96]  push myself is if someone else pushes me like that's that's why i that's why that's why i said
[2990.96 --> 2998.40]  i would go with you is you need a you need a gym bro yeah but i think i need scores i need like a score
[2998.40 --> 3002.88]  like yeah there has to be like a winner and a loser and if i go lifting with you there's there's a
[3002.88 --> 3008.48]  winner and a loser all right but i think we all know who it is yeah you have to self-competition
[3008.48 --> 3016.88]  to a certain degree yeah i i like mixing in i like mixing in boxing um like but yeah okay here's here's
[3016.88 --> 3024.96]  my problem my problem with it is that like i can't i can't motivate myself like even badminton i i am
[3024.96 --> 3032.96]  sort of notorious for abandoning people when i get too good to play with them um which maybe makes me
[3033.52 --> 3039.44]  a bit of a a bit of a butthole um you know you can make you could make that argument
[3041.04 --> 3047.52]  but the thing is like what i find is that uh one of my uh one of my old doubles partners said to me
[3047.52 --> 3056.40]  it's like some expression like you can't sharpen your knife on on adult like you can't sharpen a uh
[3056.96 --> 3061.84]  uh a blade against a dull thing or something like that or whatever it was some some expression i'm
[3061.84 --> 3066.56]  sure someone's gonna tell me what the expression is but it's like like a proverb or something um
[3068.24 --> 3075.36]  good expression thumbs up yeah good expression thumbs up um and it i find for me that's true if i play with
[3075.36 --> 3082.56]  or against bad players i will play down and if i play with or against good players i'll play up
[3082.56 --> 3087.92]  and so that's true for pretty much everyone though like that's a you that that's like a
[3089.12 --> 3097.68]  one of the issues with with gaming and sport is if your region is bad it's going to be much more
[3097.68 --> 3104.40]  difficult for you to be worldwide scale really good yes because you need to be competing against good
[3104.40 --> 3110.72]  people in order to elevate yourself joe r says the best person to compete against is yourself
[3110.72 --> 3116.88]  try to always beat your old record yeah but like oh that's so boring i hear you i'm in the same spot
[3116.88 --> 3124.16]  there i've yeah i find it to be to be definitely not as fun i like doing stuff uh like pushing sleds and
[3124.96 --> 3131.60]  doing things that feel more sport like that sounds horrible that helps me that's pushing what are you like
[3131.60 --> 3138.80]  a husky what well i guess they pull sleds but it's the same principle same principle yeah a little
[3138.80 --> 3143.92]  different i don't know i i just i have such a hard time and i i don't like the i don't like the the
[3143.92 --> 3152.16]  testosterone-y environment of the okay i've set foot in i set foot in my high school gym outside of the
[3152.16 --> 3156.96]  units where you have to do high school hold on hold on that's the last gym i set foot in so i'll tell you
[3156.96 --> 3163.60]  that much uh that that should give you some idea so i set foot in there once i was looking for
[3163.60 --> 3168.08]  someone that i wanted to hang out with at lunch and that should give you some idea how often the
[3168.08 --> 3172.56]  people that i hung out with i might expect to find them in the gym it was my last resort i was in there
[3172.56 --> 3180.96]  one time and i hated it it was the worst i was like nope forget it i hate these people i'm done i'm out
[3180.96 --> 3189.12]  i and the funny thing about it is as adults the the those people who go in the gym has changed a lot
[3189.12 --> 3193.76]  like there's so many people on staff like i haven't seen ed in pretty much two months because i haven't
[3193.76 --> 3198.40]  been going to work and i i like i looked at him today and i was like you've been going to the gym
[3199.12 --> 3204.88]  he's like no no i something something something i'm like he's like yeah i've been going to the gym i'm like
[3204.88 --> 3210.08]  shut up you jerk but he's like he's like jack now like he's like kind of barrel chested right
[3210.08 --> 3214.16]  now it's kind of crazy because you probably haven't seen him in a few months either no i haven't seen
[3214.88 --> 3224.08]  so like the the kind of people that go to the gym is like ed taron brandon yeah that's like that would
[3224.08 --> 3228.96]  have been not that far off clearly david yeah people i would have hung out with like in high school i'd
[3228.96 --> 3234.48]  have been fine like chilling with those guys yeah yeah it's actually kind of crazy like for like a
[3234.48 --> 3242.00]  tech nerd company the percentage of people at lmg that take being in shape quite seriously someone
[3242.00 --> 3249.92]  said taron question mark lol no taron goes to the gym taron is jacked taron is like way more stacked
[3249.92 --> 3257.68]  than you realize oh yeah i would not fight taron like i would be scared not because i think his form
[3257.68 --> 3267.52]  would be very good but he is enough stronger than me that i would be in a bad place like when i met a
[3267.52 --> 3271.52]  lot of people are surprised when i met taron because you got to remember he's like six inches taller than
[3271.52 --> 3280.48]  me right when i met taron i probably had 20 pounds on him now yeah he's probably got like 45 55 pounds on
[3280.48 --> 3287.44]  me like he's put on like a like i i don't know how long it's been six or seven years i'm assuming he's put on
[3287.44 --> 3294.24]  a six or seven years like weight gaining yeah strength building campaign yeah and he's been
[3294.24 --> 3299.68]  he's been kind of killing it so like you know how the perception of like vegetarianism and veganism has
[3299.68 --> 3306.08]  changed over the last 10 years or so taron has basically followed that perception when i met him
[3306.08 --> 3313.76]  he was the stereotypical like healthy vegetarian and now he's the stereotypical healthy vegetarian you know
[3313.76 --> 3322.56]  like i didn't even know he's a vegetarian but like yeah he is anymore i'm not sure i okay yeah but he
[3322.56 --> 3330.24]  was when i met him yeah taron is stacked yes yeah don't doubt oh yeah dennis too like dennis is way
[3330.24 --> 3338.16]  thicker than you guys might realize yeah so yeah i'm not committing anything when it comes to going to the
[3338.16 --> 3348.16]  gym i hate it and it smells bad and the people make me uncomfortable and i find the equipment scary and i don't know how to use it and i don't want to do it
[3348.48 --> 3352.72]  we could go to uh my parents jim i still don't want to do it
[3355.60 --> 3362.16]  i hate everything about it there you go all right uh posted by the last millennial um texas instrument
[3362.16 --> 3371.20]  um texas instrument bans asm programs i'm sorry on ti84 calculators the most recent os for the ti83
[3371.20 --> 3376.48]  premium ce removes the ability for the calculator to run any assembly code that means that any programs
[3376.48 --> 3384.88]  written in asm or c will not run on any ce operating on the newest ti os 5.5.1 or higher the impetus for
[3384.88 --> 3391.68]  the change seems to be a popular youtube video uh showing test mode restriction being bypassed so
[3391.68 --> 3398.08]  ti's response aims to uphold their exam mode security reputation the thing is that the calculator
[3398.08 --> 3404.96]  running or the calculator in the video is running on an obsolete three-year-old os and the community
[3404.96 --> 3412.32]  that has sprung up around programming for these calculators has over the years as far as i can
[3412.32 --> 3419.68]  tell actively protected a lot of the exploits that already existed and had nothing to do with running
[3419.68 --> 3425.92]  assembly code on these programs that would allow them to be exploited the os is not great it's not
[3425.92 --> 3432.00]  secure and if someone wanted to bypass this they could do so easily enough so all they've done
[3432.00 --> 3439.20]  effectively here is shut down the ability for homebrew coders and people just learning to use
[3439.20 --> 3445.60]  really the you know the device that they've already got to learn some basic assembly code it's just a
[3445.60 --> 3450.48]  crappy move and makes absolutely no sense and makes no difference whatsoever and really all that's
[3450.48 --> 3456.16]  serving to do is antagonize that community that has been around for so long and put them in a position
[3456.16 --> 3462.80]  where they might start trying to break the security rather than you know protect these secrets so this
[3462.80 --> 3471.20]  seems like just a bad move bad move stupid move dumb move and i get that you know it's a lucrative market
[3471.20 --> 3478.48]  right selling garbage for 130 bucks or whatever it costs for a ti80 whatever um and you know you
[3478.48 --> 3486.32]  don't want to lose your status as an approved exam taking calculator but find another way right
[3488.08 --> 3494.56]  geez yeah put the development time into doing it properly lord knows you can afford it for what
[3494.56 --> 3503.36]  you charge for those calculators it's absurd they must have one of the greatest uh like percentages
[3503.92 --> 3508.88]  i don't remember the proper term for it but percentages on sale for for like each product
[3508.88 --> 3516.80]  that they sell of any tech company out there that sells physical products yeah we i mean i talked about
[3516.80 --> 3523.28]  this in a recent video people complain a lot about apple's profit on their products but compared to
[3523.28 --> 3530.56]  stuff like the uh the the 550 us dollar gigabit network module that i put in my ups the other day
[3530.56 --> 3536.88]  or this calculator that you know how many how many dollars of you know we're talking black and white
[3536.88 --> 3548.40]  displays man what year is it right like it's it's obscene they're so cheap oh man the spacex launch was
[3548.40 --> 3557.20]  delayed yeah bad weather happens yep i mean they do have a backup window fairly soon if i recall correctly
[3557.20 --> 3565.12]  right yeah i don't remember when um space see if i can find it
[3569.76 --> 3576.48]  yeah may 30th you're gonna be watching tomorrow yep but they have like 500 000 people watching or
[3576.48 --> 3582.64]  something crazy like that it's pretty nuts if if they have a launch that's during like standard
[3582.64 --> 3590.56]  hours flow plane productivity dips and i don't even i just watch the vod later but like it it just it
[3590.56 --> 3599.44]  happens i can tell yep yeah i get it i get it you know if they uh with that kind of watch time man
[3599.44 --> 3604.00]  they drag that out for a few hours that is a lot of youtube premium revenue you know that could uh
[3605.04 --> 3611.44]  be a nice little you know nice little mortgage helper you know yeah yeah yeah we paid for some
[3611.44 --> 3618.72]  minuscule percentage of the fuel with youtube premium i got one more topic i wanted to get
[3618.72 --> 3625.28]  through today mac os 10.15.5 has a feature that reduces your battery life to save your battery's life
[3625.28 --> 3631.36]  nice yeah they've done this quite a few times i love it no this is great no this is this is a good
[3631.36 --> 3639.04]  thing this is a good thing so this is um you know similar to what you might find on um oh man i'm trying
[3639.04 --> 3643.52]  to think of who else does a good job of this i think dell has a widget that allows you to do this
[3643.52 --> 3651.84]  on their laptops don't quote me on that but basically it's a battery health management um tool that allows
[3651.84 --> 3659.76]  you to uh change the maximum amount that your battery will charge so if you charge your lithium
[3659.76 --> 3664.56]  battery to its maximum and especially if you leave it there it will degrade much faster than if you
[3664.56 --> 3672.64]  charge it to 80 allow it to go down to 60 and then top it back up okay uh so having it operate within
[3672.64 --> 3679.44]  a narrower range and never at the extremes will make it last for many many many more charge cycles
[3679.44 --> 3684.80]  even if you don't get as much time away from the wall outlet on each go so let me just see if
[3684.80 --> 3689.52]  there's anything else in my notes here that i was supposed to talk about but the maximum oh this is
[3689.52 --> 3694.48]  cool the maximum charge apparently it's like done dynamically so it's changed based on your charging
[3694.48 --> 3702.08]  patterns and the battery temperature that's pretty cool and first we can use the analogy of a storage
[3702.08 --> 3707.52]  closet yeah uh i don't know who actually put this in here oh alex clark he says imo this is awesome
[3707.52 --> 3711.76]  there's not many times that i need the full 10 hours or whatever of battery life on my laptop
[3711.76 --> 3715.76]  normally i'll just be using it away from the wall for an hour or two so being able to save the battery
[3715.76 --> 3720.56]  in the long term is something that i would turn on immediately the problem though is those times that
[3720.56 --> 3727.12]  you do want 100 how does it know or how do you deal with that that's uh that's kind of a tougher
[3727.12 --> 3732.48]  question i it would be nice to have that as an option apparently msi does this as well says garrett
[3732.48 --> 3738.64]  h in the float plane chat that's pretty cool it's it's happened a number of times in the past
[3738.64 --> 3745.44]  um this implementation where it tries to like learn and stuff and it seems to know charging patterns and
[3745.44 --> 3750.72]  whatnot that's super cool well i know huawei's doing that on their phones like their ai whatever it'll
[3750.72 --> 3754.72]  tune power usage i don't know if it actually tunes how much the battery charges though so don't quote me
[3754.72 --> 3758.88]  on that all right was there anything else tech wise that you wanted to talk about this week
[3758.88 --> 3769.36]  these uh anti-5g usb sticks oh lordy i was just gonna gloss over that so stupid fine fine okay so
[3769.36 --> 3773.36]  let's check out this photo i'll bring it up you want to talk people through it while i bring up this
[3773.36 --> 3781.52]  picture that makes my brain hurt i honestly don't fully understand um nobody understands this i have
[3781.52 --> 3787.52]  read into this um usually i haven't even read into these articles before we hit wan show i have actually
[3787.52 --> 3793.84]  read into this and i still don't fully get it maybe maybe i'm just not um big brain enough to
[3793.84 --> 3802.00]  understand why i need a 5g bio shield um but they are they are they are called 5g bio shields they are
[3802.00 --> 3813.20]  350 i believe uh and they are actually just a 128 megabyte flash drive which is amazing and they have a
[3813.20 --> 3823.28]  sticker on them and that's it and they are sold out and now they're being peddled on the street
[3825.36 --> 3832.08]  what is happening i don't understand how else are you gonna fight the electric fog there's some yes
[3832.08 --> 3838.48]  electric fog there's some amazing quotes i i like that i don't see them really in our in our docs i'm
[3838.48 --> 3844.16]  trying to look them up right now um oh here we okay this is my favorite section the 5g bio shield
[3844.16 --> 3850.88]  makes it possible thanks to a uniquely applied process of quantum nano layer technology to balance
[3850.88 --> 3858.64]  the imbalance of electric oscillations arising from all electric fog induced by all devices such as
[3858.64 --> 3868.24]  laptops cordless phones wireless lan tablets etc the usb stick brings a balance
[3868.80 --> 3873.04]  sorry brings balance into the field sounds like brings balance to the force but
[3873.04 --> 3880.64]  brings balance into the field at the atomic and cellular level restoring balanced effects to all harmful
[3880.64 --> 3883.28]  ionized and non-ionized radiation
[3886.16 --> 3887.52]  what an impressive sticker
[3890.08 --> 3896.48]  all right so if you want me to keep the beard you can go on lttstore.com and buy the beard version of the
[3896.48 --> 3896.80]  shirt
[3900.56 --> 3908.32]  if you want me to shave that disgusting you know thing on your face then you can buy the clean version of
[3908.32 --> 3916.64]  the shirt and whichever one sells more in the next two weeks lttstore.com dictates my facial hairstyle for
[3916.64 --> 3922.80]  the beard shirt buy the beard shirt for the rest of the year so there's the bird design beard design
[3922.80 --> 3928.08]  beard designs right there and the one i'm wearing the one i'm representing is the clean design i would
[3928.08 --> 3932.64]  actually you're representing the clean design i would actually prefer to go back to the clean face just
[3932.64 --> 3938.64]  because it's like even more of a reason to buy the beard shirt especially if i wear a mask it's pretty itchy
[3938.64 --> 3946.56]  um it's like it's another thing to maintain um okay so far it hasn't been much work because i just have
[3946.56 --> 3953.04]  to keep the neckline clean but it's getting like it's getting too long and so now i'm gonna have to
[3953.04 --> 3959.20]  like learn to shape it and stuff and that just uh you know it's like it looks really good though
[3959.20 --> 3964.40]  by the way on flow plane there is bearded linus and non-bearded linus emotes are there really
[3964.96 --> 3972.08]  there are yeah i believe everyone has them oh seriously oh lordy yeah okay that's it's all
[3972.08 --> 3974.72]  all over the chat thanks guys yeah that's funny
[3976.96 --> 3986.08]  ah all right aj likes the beard all right thanks aj thanks aj all right well i think that's it for the
[3986.08 --> 3994.16]  show i have nothing to say about the 5g bio shield other than just please please it's time to stop

[4034.56 --> 4038.40]  that's cool and stream wait super chats oh that was close
[4038.40 --> 4044.72]  super chats dang that was really close they're not loading thank you amazing youtube dashboard for
[4044.72 --> 4049.60]  being so amazing okay if it doesn't load i'm not going to be able to do super chats here i'm going
[4049.60 --> 4059.60]  to try refreshing the page it's ridiculous driving me crazy it's taking forever to load jaden seems to
[4059.60 --> 4066.56]  also like the beard he's making it very well known thanks jaden spamming he's spamming i'm banning him
[4067.28 --> 4067.92]  i'm banning him
[4072.00 --> 4077.44]  all right let's see if my reloaded page works ah yes there we go zaki asks when are we getting ltt panties
[4077.44 --> 4081.84]  we're honestly not working on that we've said so many times we're not working on that yvonne just made
[4081.84 --> 4090.96]  one pair for herself uh calvin w says you can make a pair for yourself um calvin w says lawful masses
[4090.96 --> 4095.04]  with leonard french a youtube law channel went through the executive order it's apparently
[4095.04 --> 4100.56]  super poorly written and is one pretty toothless and two hard to figure out exactly what he's asking
[4100.56 --> 4106.40]  the government to do i find that very surprising uh greg schneider says i want all ltt videos in every
[4106.40 --> 4110.72]  channel all the time and have never supported the oh i watch probably and have never supported the
[4110.72 --> 4116.08]  team minus if you get hit by a bus i'll take your job i promise not to be driving the bus thanks greg
[4119.92 --> 4127.84]  good super chat thanks beyond 4k yeah thumbs up um johnny could you do some sort of quick video
[4127.84 --> 4133.28]  uh explaining the naming conventions of intel nvidia named these product lines i could try
[4133.28 --> 4141.92]  like they keep changing i wish they just have some consistency you know light blue oyster cult says
[4141.92 --> 4146.72]  it's been said linus is an intel shill it's been said linus is an amd shill but i now realize linus
[4146.72 --> 4151.20]  is a tech clint eastwood in a fistful of dollars taking money from both sides while playing each side
[4151.20 --> 4160.32]  against the other i can neither confirm nor deny jack says hey like linus and luke my girlfriend
[4160.32 --> 4165.84]  kristin said she needs a new pc game to play which would you suggest to her she's basically only played
[4165.84 --> 4173.84]  minecraft and is brand new to pc gaming thanks in part to youtube have you tried it i have is it any good
[4173.84 --> 4184.00]  um i wasn't super enthralled it it's it feels well made i played like the day it launched and there
[4184.00 --> 4190.88]  was no issues and the game ran super smooth it felt really good the i really like the graphics all that
[4190.88 --> 4198.80]  kind of stuff um but kind of empty but those yeah yeah just felt kind of empty yeah it seemed like there
[4198.80 --> 4204.64]  was way too much there there's no classes which is like kind of cool because you kind of construct
[4204.64 --> 4213.44]  your character through your itemization right and i mean yeah your itemization um but it just the
[4213.44 --> 4218.40]  the progression didn't really fit and they have enchants and stuff i don't know it has stuff going for
[4218.40 --> 4224.64]  it i could totally see people liking it especially if you want that type of like a path of exile or
[4224.64 --> 4230.16]  diablo style experience but more casual um i also really like that there is well implemented local
[4230.16 --> 4234.96]  multiplayer right because that's not something that's super common these days yeah so if you want
[4234.96 --> 4244.00]  a fun relaxing entertaining good looking couch game great um i'm i'm not gonna i'm not like
[4245.28 --> 4250.00]  falling over myself to play it all the time but definitely an interesting addition i'm going with
[4250.00 --> 4257.44]  overcooked game lineup i think it's a yeah for sure it's a great it's a great couples game uh because
[4257.44 --> 4261.04]  you either will bond as a couple or you'll realize you didn't need to be a couple at all
[4262.40 --> 4270.56]  yeah that's overcooked in a nutshell yeah eggshell but then once you beat it like i don't know i'm
[4270.56 --> 4276.40]  cool with other couch games no but i mean uh jack can always send me a new super chat when they're done
[4276.40 --> 4284.72]  with overcooked get you that get you that new recommendation bro got you covered uh robert
[4284.72 --> 4290.56]  mail says mc pro hosting got hijacked okay you know who didn't get hijacked the ltt minecrafts are
[4290.56 --> 4299.04]  oh lord uh mc.lt.gg yes okay that's fair enough um xhell cats asks when will floatplane chat be available
[4299.04 --> 4305.04]  in the app yeah luke because then i would be able to put my phone in front of me when i'm streaming and
[4305.04 --> 4308.80]  i could see the floatplane chat that'd be super handy i mean you could probably just do that with
[4308.80 --> 4314.40]  one of your extra monitors at home no i don't i don't have any extra monitors at home get an extra
[4314.40 --> 4320.72]  monitor at home i have limited space at home luke this is like this is like the meme like linus is
[4320.72 --> 4325.52]  driving home with his mom and he's like mom can we get an extra monitor and mom is like we have an
[4325.52 --> 4330.40]  extra monitor at home and then it's extra monitor at home it's just his phone well yeah but like
[4330.40 --> 4335.68]  it's bad that's all i have space for i i've got an ultra wide here i don't have room to get another
[4335.68 --> 4340.24]  monitor for it you could mount one you could mount one oh my gosh i'm not i'm not doing that i've got
[4340.24 --> 4346.16]  my lights above it and camera above it and like there's a wall like okay here's my hand that's the
[4346.16 --> 4352.16]  wall okay and then yvonne's desk right there that's it that's as far as i went like that's it this is all
[4352.16 --> 4359.36]  i got until unless i move i kind of want to move and just like make like a battle station room just like
[4359.36 --> 4362.96]  why'd you need a bigger house because i needed an entire room for my battle station that would be
[4362.96 --> 4369.36]  such a flex oh my goodness be super happy yeah it's it's there's there's a lot of features we
[4369.36 --> 4374.96]  want right now we're really pushing to get the new uh different types of content posting stuff out
[4376.00 --> 4384.32]  that's like we're very very focused on that right now um to live chat in the app dark mode yeah there's
[4384.32 --> 4391.20]  a lot of like user centric features that we want to release and we will be releasing um but we're
[4391.20 --> 4395.04]  we're really trying to push this different types of content thing out first because it's something that
[4395.04 --> 4400.64]  i think we've needed for a long time um and is going to be a pretty major upgrade to the site and then
[4400.64 --> 4405.68]  there's there's a lot of like front end improvements that we want to do there's a lot of things that you
[4405.68 --> 4411.04]  you guys know of like dark mode like like live stream in the in the app or live stream chat in the app
[4411.04 --> 4421.20]  etc that yeah the the to-do list on flow plane is long and rather it's hard and very hard um but yeah
[4421.20 --> 4427.44]  we'll get to it last super chat for zed just because i love this i love this uh 10 10 pounds
[4427.44 --> 4433.92]  just because after years of enjoyment i should contribute and i quit smoking so have some of my
[4433.92 --> 4440.40]  ex tar funds you know what zed awesome good on you i mean there are there are few things that i would
[4440.40 --> 4447.04]  consider to be a worse use of money than sending a super chat to a youtuber but smoking is one of
[4447.04 --> 4456.80]  them definitely one of them you won the game today big kudos big kudos to zed for uh for just getting
[4456.80 --> 4462.64]  rid of that habit great job all right that's it for the show just that little bit a little bit of
[4462.64 --> 4467.68]  positivity a little bit of positivity is a good thing right about now i think all right thanks guys
