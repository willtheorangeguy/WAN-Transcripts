[0.00 --> 2.36]  Going live?
[2.36 --> 2.94]  We're going...
[2.94 --> 3.76]  Oh, we did it!
[3.84 --> 4.18]  Yes!
[4.48 --> 4.88]  Yes!
[5.24 --> 7.34]  All of YouTube doesn't know this, but that was an adventure.
[8.70 --> 9.46]  Welcome, YouTube.
[9.72 --> 13.00]  We've been trying to go live on you for...
[13.00 --> 14.84]  Let's not...
[14.84 --> 16.04]  Let's say half an hour.
[16.20 --> 17.14]  Yeah, for a while.
[17.72 --> 19.62]  Okay, so welcome to the WAN Show.
[19.68 --> 20.76]  Now it's starting for real.
[21.04 --> 23.20]  What are we going to talk about today, Alex?
[23.52 --> 25.04]  Yeah, we've got the Pixel 4a.
[25.12 --> 26.00]  It's leaked a bunch.
[26.12 --> 27.44]  Big surprise right there.
[27.92 --> 29.04]  Huge big surprise.
[29.04 --> 36.92]  Also, the European Union is thinking about introducing a right to repair legislation that they're working on, and that's exciting.
[37.86 --> 38.96]  Also, Honeywell.
[39.08 --> 42.08]  They built the most powerful computer, or quantum computer.
[42.20 --> 42.52]  Did they?
[42.72 --> 44.68]  I guess that they make quantum computers.
[44.82 --> 46.18]  Did they achieve quantum supremacy?
[46.62 --> 47.40]  Apparently, yes.
[47.46 --> 48.86]  We have no time for jokes now.
[48.96 --> 49.84]  We'll get to that later.
[50.24 --> 54.26]  For now, it's the part of the show when you do the intro, I believe.
[54.50 --> 55.02]  It is, yeah.
[55.96 --> 56.96]  Hit that intro.
[56.96 --> 57.96]  Boom.
[59.04 --> 59.88]  Hey.
[60.54 --> 61.98]  Do they talk during this point?
[62.92 --> 65.32]  They normally do, but the viewers don't like it very much.
[65.46 --> 65.96]  Oh, okay.
[66.08 --> 66.38]  Sorry.
[66.38 --> 79.90]  Do I do that?
[79.98 --> 80.28]  No.
[81.86 --> 83.44]  It's not FreshBooks right now.
[83.60 --> 84.38]  Well, but you have to...
[84.38 --> 85.20]  You're supposed to do this.
[86.04 --> 86.94]  Oh, shoot.
[87.02 --> 87.60]  You do this.
[87.60 --> 90.30]  Sorry.
[90.64 --> 91.78]  Intro one more time.
[93.00 --> 94.02]  You're a professional.
[94.42 --> 95.46]  Intro one more time.
[96.42 --> 96.84]  Okay.
[97.64 --> 98.60]  And then...
[99.60 --> 102.76]  It says the time at which it happens.
[104.82 --> 106.06]  And then I do this.
[106.74 --> 106.94]  Huh?
[107.50 --> 107.82]  Huh?
[109.30 --> 110.44]  That's my FreshBooks.
[110.44 --> 111.62]  Oh, you do that.
[111.86 --> 112.54]  Oh, you did it.
[112.62 --> 113.22]  Boom.
[113.68 --> 115.36]  Savage jerky.
[115.82 --> 115.88]  Yeah.
[116.88 --> 117.38]  Yes.
[117.92 --> 121.04]  And now, back to the good stuff.
[122.10 --> 122.50]  Hello.
[122.50 --> 126.80]  So, the Pixel 4a.
[127.60 --> 131.78]  So, it's unsurprising that it's leaked, but I'm actually pretty excited about what there
[131.78 --> 132.12]  is.
[132.72 --> 132.94]  Yeah?
[133.14 --> 135.80]  So, there's a couple things here.
[135.88 --> 137.84]  For one, they're not doing the stupid...
[137.84 --> 140.72]  Does the Pixel 3 have the one where it scans your face, or is that just the 4?
[141.38 --> 142.02]  Just the 4.
[142.12 --> 143.08]  I have the Pixel 3.
[143.46 --> 147.70]  And I was kind of upset because I was excited when they announced the Pixel 4 with the Project
[147.70 --> 148.74]  Soli sensors.
[149.42 --> 150.40]  Of course you were.
[150.46 --> 150.60]  What?
[151.20 --> 153.60]  I think we talked about this a little bit when it was being announced.
[154.02 --> 155.34]  I was like, ooh, cool.
[155.44 --> 160.74]  Because I don't know if you guys saw this, but when Google first announced Project Soli,
[160.74 --> 163.68]  it was this secretive research project.
[164.24 --> 167.40]  And they were like, we can sense little tiny movements that you're going to make with your
[167.40 --> 167.76]  fingers.
[168.02 --> 172.26]  You're going to be able to have a little doohickey, and you're going to be able to kind of dingle
[172.26 --> 174.24]  your fingies on top of it like this.
[175.22 --> 181.86]  And you're going to be able to turn volume up, and swipe things away, and multitask, all
[181.86 --> 182.92]  without touching your phone.
[183.40 --> 183.56]  Yeah.
[183.80 --> 186.76]  But the reason this was cool, Alex, let me tell you about it.
[187.24 --> 187.46]  Okay?
[187.46 --> 194.36]  The reason this was so cool is because it had applications for not just phones, but laptops,
[194.88 --> 197.10]  or maybe you had a little computing device.
[197.10 --> 198.62]  And it didn't even have a screen.
[198.72 --> 199.16]  I don't know.
[199.24 --> 200.40]  And you're doing stuff with your hands.
[200.76 --> 202.14]  That sounded pretty cool to me.
[202.68 --> 203.50]  But turns out...
[203.50 --> 205.30]  Doesn't work great.
[205.38 --> 205.92]  That's not what it was.
[205.92 --> 208.38]  And also, I'm totally fine if they have that.
[208.50 --> 210.36]  But also, I just want the little fingerprint reader.
[210.44 --> 211.04]  This thing's so fast.
[211.12 --> 211.60]  Like, bam!
[212.00 --> 212.34]  Yeah.
[212.66 --> 212.96]  Boom!
[213.08 --> 213.34]  Great.
[213.34 --> 214.36]  And I have one of those, too.
[214.72 --> 215.88]  And then they took it away.
[215.96 --> 217.10]  Because he's got a Pixel 2.
[217.58 --> 217.80]  Yeah.
[217.90 --> 218.74]  I have a Pixel 3.
[219.36 --> 220.52]  James has a Pixel 4.
[221.60 --> 222.00]  But...
[222.00 --> 223.26]  And he's the...
[223.26 --> 224.62]  He's probably the least happy.
[225.26 --> 226.00]  I'm just kidding.
[226.34 --> 226.60]  Yeah.
[226.60 --> 227.22]  Don't quote me on that.
[227.54 --> 232.02]  Well, the Pixel 4, it looks like it's going to, you know, it's going to have this fingerprint
[232.02 --> 232.86]  reader on the back.
[232.96 --> 235.58]  It also looks like it's going to have headphones.
[235.58 --> 236.16]  Oh, let's go to that.
[236.28 --> 236.58]  Let's go...
[236.58 --> 238.00]  This is where we go to the sources.
[238.44 --> 238.80]  Yes.
[239.36 --> 240.64]  Yeah, you're looking at it right now.
[240.68 --> 240.94]  Boom.
[241.20 --> 242.46]  And you can still see us.
[243.34 --> 245.34]  Which is also awesome because...
[245.34 --> 246.26]  I don't know.
[246.32 --> 247.34]  I don't like Bluetooth earbuds.
[248.50 --> 248.88]  You don't?
[249.08 --> 250.04]  I like the big...
[250.04 --> 250.98]  I like the cans.
[251.16 --> 251.26]  Oh.
[251.26 --> 252.86]  If you have, like, the big ones, those are great.
[253.00 --> 253.70]  I see what you're saying.
[253.76 --> 254.98]  But I don't like the little earbuds.
[255.40 --> 255.76]  Like...
[255.76 --> 256.18]  See...
[256.18 --> 257.02]  I've used AirPods.
[257.30 --> 258.40]  I've used the Pixel Buds.
[259.84 --> 260.56]  Just not a fan.
[260.56 --> 265.12]  It's been really frustrating watching the industry as a whole kind of move towards removing headphone
[265.12 --> 265.84]  jacks.
[265.84 --> 270.14]  Because emotionally, you know, it puts you through the wringer.
[270.28 --> 270.94]  Because you're like...
[270.94 --> 274.56]  The first time they remove the headphone jack, you're like, no, my headphones!
[274.90 --> 277.52]  My 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, I love it!
[277.88 --> 279.66]  And then you're kind of like, all right.
[279.70 --> 280.68]  Then you go to acceptance.
[281.06 --> 281.96]  Where you're like, all right.
[282.64 --> 283.36]  There's...
[283.36 --> 284.46]  The jack is dead.
[284.52 --> 285.30]  They're taking it away.
[285.72 --> 286.96]  And a car horn is honking.
[286.96 --> 288.22]  I don't know if you guys can hear that.
[289.48 --> 291.96]  We're going to get copyright infringed.
[291.96 --> 292.48]  Infringed.
[292.78 --> 294.12]  Copyright striked for having...
[294.88 --> 297.32]  That's a sound you can get from a music library somewhere.
[298.28 --> 298.96]  They took...
[298.96 --> 300.56]  Anyways, you go to acceptance, right?
[301.22 --> 302.62]  So you're like, okay, I'm going to...
[302.62 --> 304.20]  I guess I'll buy good Bluetooth earphones.
[304.28 --> 305.24]  I guess I'll get into that.
[305.28 --> 306.06]  And that's the future.
[306.36 --> 309.78]  And then they do the stuff like this where they're like, just kidding.
[309.84 --> 311.44]  We can put in a headphone jack if we want.
[311.50 --> 312.86]  It's not a necessary thing.
[313.22 --> 313.52]  Yeah.
[313.96 --> 315.08]  And you're just like, ah, what?
[315.16 --> 316.96]  So now I just don't like it.
[317.50 --> 318.68]  Well, for me, it was like...
[318.68 --> 323.16]  My big problem with wireless earbuds is that they just don't have enough battery capacity.
[323.72 --> 325.18]  Like, it's pretty good.
[326.18 --> 332.50]  But I do this thing constantly where it's good enough that you don't have to plug it in every single night.
[332.98 --> 337.10]  But it's not good enough that you can go for like a week like you can with the over-ear ones.
[337.60 --> 343.56]  So I'm just constantly in this situation where like, you just want to throw in some earbuds and suddenly they don't work.
[343.56 --> 345.56]  And you're like, ah, geez.
[346.26 --> 351.56]  So like, I had Pixel Buds and then instead I stopped using them and I just bought four pairs of like...
[352.16 --> 354.96]  What are the ones like the Pixel headphones that you just plug in here?
[356.62 --> 358.52]  Oh, you mean like the ones that come in the box?
[358.80 --> 358.98]  Yeah.
[359.20 --> 359.58]  USB-C.
[359.90 --> 362.02]  They're like 20, 30 bucks, something like that.
[362.28 --> 364.54]  I just bought a bunch of them, stuck them in every bag that I own.
[364.64 --> 366.68]  And I have been really happy ever since then.
[367.12 --> 367.44]  Yeah.
[367.84 --> 369.08]  And that's what I use.
[369.28 --> 370.80]  I use the ones that came with my phone.
[370.80 --> 374.16]  But they're just like, they're not as good as a headphone jack though.
[374.36 --> 375.90]  Even on the Pixel 2 they didn't have it.
[376.00 --> 376.14]  No.
[376.38 --> 377.58]  Pixel 1 had a headphone jack.
[377.68 --> 378.14]  I think so.
[378.56 --> 379.38]  It's so funny.
[379.66 --> 382.28]  Because they did this, the Pixel 3a had a headphone jack as well.
[382.52 --> 383.66]  Here, I'll show you guys my screen.
[383.74 --> 385.54]  I'm looking at something very interesting.
[385.64 --> 388.88]  So that's, there was a huge, there were tons of photos leaked.
[389.00 --> 391.80]  There was a huge hands-on video as well leaked.
[391.80 --> 396.46]  So we've basically seen the phone in all its glory.
[397.06 --> 399.54]  You can see there, there's a, what do you call it?
[399.80 --> 401.32]  Pole hunch.
[401.98 --> 403.14]  Pole punch camera.
[403.78 --> 407.90]  So there is no, the sensor bar that was in the Pixel 4 is not there.
[407.98 --> 411.48]  So we won't have those same Project Soli gestures anyways.
[412.10 --> 414.24]  So nothing to get disappointed about, I guess.
[414.96 --> 415.58]  For you.
[415.72 --> 415.90]  Yeah.
[415.90 --> 418.32]  The only person in the world that cares.
[418.48 --> 421.74]  Look, I'm sure other people cared about this.
[421.82 --> 422.94]  There's the fingerprint sensor.
[423.08 --> 428.72]  And we have the rectangular square shaped camera cut out as well.
[428.80 --> 430.58]  Although I don't know if it has.
[430.62 --> 431.96]  I'm pretty sure it's just one lens.
[432.04 --> 435.12]  So it's only like that just to look cool.
[435.26 --> 437.64]  And those pictures are all courtesy of TechDroider.
[438.60 --> 439.74]  So thanks a lot.
[441.74 --> 442.86]  Yeah, I don't know.
[442.86 --> 447.04]  And then the other important detail was, what am I looking at here?
[447.68 --> 448.30]  The $399.
[448.54 --> 449.72]  It's going to start at $399.
[450.48 --> 453.80]  Apparently, because billboard mock-ups were discovered,
[454.08 --> 458.10]  where apparently Google's ready to advertise it already.
[459.16 --> 461.10]  Nothing, there's no mystery anymore.
[461.44 --> 462.52]  It's kind of sad.
[462.68 --> 462.94]  In phones.
[463.52 --> 464.48]  In anything, mostly.
[465.26 --> 467.74]  Every phone that comes out, you know, in everything.
[469.16 --> 471.98]  Every phone that comes out, you know everything about it before it launches.
[471.98 --> 473.74]  It's like, what's the point?
[474.40 --> 474.64]  You know?
[475.30 --> 476.64]  Well, this kind of leads nicely.
[477.64 --> 481.38]  Overall, though, I'm pretty stoked because it just might be my next phone.
[481.52 --> 486.72]  Because it's just, I think that the price and the headphone jack and, you know,
[486.82 --> 489.32]  it just being seeming generally good.
[489.40 --> 490.74]  This fingerprint reader, awesome.
[491.52 --> 494.62]  And the battery on my Pixel 2 is kind of starting to die,
[494.72 --> 497.78]  which nicely brings us into our next segment.
[498.06 --> 498.42]  Oh, wow.
[498.58 --> 498.82]  Yeah.
[498.82 --> 501.04]  Starting to die and you'd love to repair it.
[501.40 --> 501.58]  Yeah.
[501.58 --> 505.98]  If only you could somehow have the right to repair it.
[507.06 --> 507.70]  So, yeah.
[507.76 --> 511.34]  The EU is going to introduce some sweeping right-to-repair legislation
[511.34 --> 513.88]  that is probably going to be awesome,
[513.96 --> 516.00]  but we don't have a lot of details, so maybe it'll be bad.
[516.00 --> 518.92]  We'll find it in a little bit.
[519.02 --> 519.38]  Could be.
[519.38 --> 523.46]  So, basically, manufacturers of phones, tablets, laptops will face legal obligations
[523.46 --> 526.12]  to make sure that their products are easier to repair and reuse.
[526.78 --> 530.50]  The commission will have eco-design law to cover phones.
[530.60 --> 531.96]  Yeah, all of those things that I just said.
[532.40 --> 533.12]  Is this what you do?
[533.24 --> 539.24]  And they voted overwhelmingly to push the device manufacturers to adopt shared charging cable.
[539.38 --> 541.06]  Okay, I actually don't like that one as much.
[541.20 --> 541.56]  Oh, what?
[541.62 --> 542.62]  The shared charging cable?
[542.72 --> 542.92]  Yeah.
[543.18 --> 543.46]  Why?
[543.46 --> 545.12]  I don't know.
[545.22 --> 545.64]  What do you mean?
[546.72 --> 547.38]  What's not that like?
[547.44 --> 549.14]  I don't see why you have to all have one cable.
[550.76 --> 552.10]  What is that supposed to mean?
[552.26 --> 553.18]  That doesn't make any sense.
[553.32 --> 554.90]  Of course you want to have all one cable.
[555.00 --> 556.18]  That's what USB-C is for.
[556.56 --> 556.94]  Yeah, true.
[557.06 --> 558.22]  USB-C is pretty great.
[559.68 --> 560.38]  Never mind.
[560.88 --> 562.14]  I'm backpatching on that.
[562.94 --> 564.70]  So, you're saying, wait, but are you saying that, like,
[565.14 --> 567.50]  because I think this was a real concern,
[567.50 --> 571.84]  that if the EU does pass this, you know, legislation saying,
[571.94 --> 575.10]  all right, we all need to have one charger for all mobile devices,
[575.60 --> 576.96]  they might not go with USB-C.
[577.04 --> 580.86]  They might go with, like, oh, that means we have to create a new one that's, like, perfect.
[581.40 --> 584.38]  I was more concerned about that you can have one cable,
[584.60 --> 589.12]  and then since that's the only standard, you're not able to do anything with it.
[590.08 --> 590.44]  What?
[591.08 --> 592.80]  Well, like, you know, there's some problems with it.
[592.86 --> 595.80]  Like, I find USB-C particularly bad for dust.
[596.30 --> 598.62]  Like, lightning is just better for that, I find.
[598.90 --> 600.40]  How dare you, sir?
[600.80 --> 604.42]  I've had to get the, you know, the old toothpick in there quite a few times
[604.42 --> 606.64]  and have, like, a link ball, like, this big come out somehow.
[606.64 --> 609.98]  Well, because USB-C has the extra little thingy in there.
[609.98 --> 610.28]  Yeah, it's got the little doodad.
[610.48 --> 612.32]  Lightning is just a hole, and you stick it in.
[612.40 --> 612.60]  Yeah.
[612.86 --> 615.86]  And USB-C has, like, it's not just a hole.
[615.94 --> 617.64]  It's, like, a hole with a doohickey in the middle.
[617.64 --> 622.82]  And, like, when I've used iPhones, I've never had problems with lightning, like, crapping out.
[622.98 --> 625.54]  Well, like, I have problems constantly where, like, I'm going for a run,
[625.76 --> 627.20]  and then my headphones are just, like...
[627.20 --> 630.04]  And then lightning, it just comes down, and you're fried, dude.
[630.88 --> 634.36]  No, but, like, with the USB Type-C, like, my headphones, they just become disconnected.
[634.50 --> 635.08]  And it's like, ugh!
[635.22 --> 636.48]  With lightning or USB Type-C?
[636.52 --> 637.12]  With Type-C.
[637.26 --> 637.58]  Oh.
[637.58 --> 639.42]  But with lightning, I've never had that issue.
[640.78 --> 644.60]  I guess it's time for you to switch to iPhone, you traitor.
[644.60 --> 647.18]  Yeah, except that they'll be on Type-C soon, maybe.
[647.64 --> 648.18]  Or they'll just not...
[648.18 --> 648.98]  Not next year.
[649.10 --> 649.52]  They'll have nothing.
[649.52 --> 650.14]  Not this year.
[651.02 --> 654.78]  The leaks don't point to a USB-C iPhone this year, my friend.
[655.48 --> 656.48]  Sorry to tell you.
[656.94 --> 659.04]  Anyway, back to the part that I'm excited about.
[659.08 --> 659.46]  Okay.
[660.48 --> 665.16]  Single-use items will be restricted, premature obsolescence will be tackled,
[665.16 --> 667.80]  and the destruction of unsold goods will be banned.
[668.30 --> 669.48]  Which is...
[669.48 --> 670.26]  I think it's awesome.
[670.40 --> 674.32]  Like, I am going to have to not use this phone because the battery is going to die,
[674.32 --> 676.74]  and it's hard to repair it.
[676.84 --> 681.34]  There's just not really any way around it, so I'm going to buy probably a Pixel 4a.
[681.46 --> 681.74]  Right.
[682.18 --> 682.62]  Oh, really?
[683.24 --> 683.48]  Maybe.
[683.62 --> 684.62]  It's finally time?
[685.20 --> 686.32]  You've been rocking that thing for...
[687.08 --> 687.70]  Well, we'll see.
[687.84 --> 688.80]  Like, when it comes out.
[688.80 --> 689.08]  What, three years?
[689.24 --> 689.50]  No.
[689.88 --> 690.46]  It's Pixel 2.
[690.58 --> 691.30]  Like, two and a half?
[692.46 --> 693.52]  And you're happy with it.
[693.66 --> 694.60]  Yeah, I still like it.
[694.60 --> 695.26]  It's kind of...
[695.26 --> 698.70]  It's really weird to, like, work at a place like Linus Media Group where everyone's, like,
[699.40 --> 701.92]  oh, I'm buying this new phone all the time, and, like, you know,
[701.96 --> 703.56]  I'm just using this phone because we have it.
[703.56 --> 706.62]  Like, you're just still rocking this Pixel 2.
[706.88 --> 709.04]  Like, it's the freaking Stone Age over here.
[709.52 --> 712.12]  Like, people still compliment me all the time on the photos.
[712.20 --> 714.28]  You even have a stone case.
[714.98 --> 717.00]  Yeah, it's peeling from all the use.
[717.18 --> 717.74]  Stone Age.
[719.10 --> 719.50]  Anyway.
[721.10 --> 721.58]  Anyway.
[721.88 --> 726.46]  Yeah, we've seen a lot of manufacturers already kind of embracing the right to repair
[726.46 --> 728.00]  in ways that I think are good.
[728.00 --> 732.46]  So, like, Dell has been just kind of leading the charge.
[732.58 --> 737.86]  I think Apple's also been excellent with just, like, their packaging is all recyclable
[737.86 --> 740.42]  minus some, like, plastic baggage.
[740.44 --> 742.96]  You're talking about general environmental friendliness.
[743.16 --> 743.36]  Yeah.
[743.46 --> 744.76]  Not necessarily right to repair.
[745.54 --> 747.56]  And, like, you can get into them pretty easily.
[748.34 --> 748.68]  Microsoft...
[748.68 --> 749.28]  Into an iPhone?
[749.68 --> 749.94]  No.
[749.94 --> 750.40]  Oh, Dell.
[751.20 --> 752.04]  You said Apple.
[752.44 --> 754.24]  You said Dell and Apple 2, so I was confused.
[754.24 --> 755.42]  The MacBook specifically.
[756.24 --> 756.96]  Oh, really?
[757.40 --> 757.58]  Yeah.
[757.64 --> 759.40]  I haven't opened up a MacBook in a while.
[759.40 --> 762.74]  It's actually really hard, but as long as you have an iFixit kit, it's fine.
[763.34 --> 763.56]  Okay.
[764.18 --> 765.44]  I guess that...
[765.44 --> 769.66]  Anyone who is opening these things up should probably have, like, an iFixit kit anyways
[769.66 --> 770.26]  or something.
[770.70 --> 770.88]  Yeah.
[770.92 --> 772.78]  Another one is, like, Microsoft.
[773.46 --> 779.44]  Their Surface Laptop 3 is awesome because it's a Surface Laptop 2, but you can get inside
[779.44 --> 782.62]  of it without, like, a heat gun destroying the whole thing.
[782.98 --> 783.26]  Oh.
[783.92 --> 784.54]  That's pretty cool.
[784.62 --> 784.74]  Yeah.
[784.74 --> 785.36]  It's just, like, four screws.
[785.44 --> 787.18]  Actually, the screws are really hard to get at.
[787.24 --> 788.24]  We cut it out of...
[788.24 --> 791.92]  We did the short circuit, and I took it apart, and we cut most of it out, but there was,
[791.92 --> 796.64]  like, a good, like, 12, 15 minutes of me trying to get these stupid rubber things out
[796.64 --> 797.90]  so I could access the screws.
[798.72 --> 799.00]  Wait.
[799.08 --> 799.90]  So it's good or bad?
[800.30 --> 801.50]  It's a lot better.
[801.66 --> 805.72]  Like, I didn't have to destroy it, but I was almost defeated by rubber nubbins.
[807.16 --> 807.60]  Again.
[808.48 --> 809.74]  The bane of my existence.
[811.16 --> 811.44]  Dennis?
[812.62 --> 813.84]  Do you have something to say?
[815.96 --> 820.96]  And so hopefully this will just generally lead to a lot more people repairing their phones
[820.96 --> 826.30]  instead of getting new ones, which kind of sucks if you're Apple or basically anyone
[826.30 --> 826.70]  else.
[827.04 --> 830.46]  So there was this fun thing back in 2018 where after...
[830.46 --> 834.86]  Do you remember that whole scandal where they were, like, they were throttling down phones
[834.86 --> 839.44]  because the battery had less capacity when it got old, and people got really mad.
[839.52 --> 839.72]  Yep.
[839.80 --> 842.00]  And they just had to give out a ton of money for that.
[842.50 --> 843.42]  Oh, that's what you're talking about.
[843.42 --> 849.04]  No, they had a bunch of batteries for sale for $29, and you could, like, replace it.
[849.18 --> 849.44]  Oh.
[849.70 --> 856.50]  And they expected to sell a million of them, and they ended up doing 11 million battery
[856.50 --> 857.10]  replacements.
[857.68 --> 857.76]  Oh, jeez.
[857.76 --> 865.20]  And ended up costing them a potential $5 to $9 billion in losses in, like, people not
[865.20 --> 866.46]  upgrading their phones.
[866.50 --> 867.28]  Oh, boy.
[867.28 --> 872.32]  But that shows you, like, how much demand there is for just replacing batteries and phones.
[872.58 --> 879.02]  It's really a hard thing because, you know, it's the clash between companies, like, doing
[879.02 --> 883.96]  things that will make them more money and consumers wanting things that will save them money.
[884.38 --> 884.62]  Yeah.
[884.88 --> 890.42]  But it's like, on the one hand, you know, these are capitalistic ventures.
[890.66 --> 894.42]  Like, that's their prerogative to, like, you know, sell more phones or whatever, and
[894.42 --> 896.02]  that's fine, I guess.
[896.02 --> 898.86]  On the other hand, that's just not very sustainable.
[899.24 --> 899.56]  It's not.
[899.98 --> 902.22]  And I think we're getting to a point now in our society.
[902.56 --> 904.38]  We live in a society, guys.
[905.38 --> 910.12]  We're getting to the point where I think, I don't know, I think we as the people are
[910.12 --> 914.02]  starting to demand that these companies take, like, environmental issues and...
[914.60 --> 914.78]  Yeah.
[914.92 --> 919.68]  But the funny thing about this is that it's the perfect nexus of environmental issues and,
[919.68 --> 921.90]  like, consumer friendliness.
[922.38 --> 922.74]  Yeah.
[922.74 --> 925.84]  In terms of, like, okay, look, we don't want to buy a new phone every three seconds.
[926.02 --> 931.06]  That also happens to be, you know, helpful for the environment where we're not throwing
[931.06 --> 931.68]  out our phones.
[932.24 --> 933.74]  And also, it's something like...
[933.74 --> 935.16]  So, like, companies are...
[935.16 --> 939.78]  It's incumbent upon them to, you know, give us what we want here.
[939.86 --> 940.80]  And I think the EU...
[940.80 --> 941.76]  This is what I was trying to say.
[941.86 --> 944.86]  And, like, somebody called me out because I think I tweeted that...
[944.86 --> 946.28]  Or maybe I didn't tweet.
[946.36 --> 947.52]  Or maybe I put it in tech linked.
[947.66 --> 948.18]  That...
[948.18 --> 949.90]  I'm like, oh, the EU is actually, like...
[951.00 --> 954.10]  Like, oh, you know, they've been the good guys this whole time.
[955.16 --> 957.54]  Somebody called me out and said, okay, what about GDPR?
[958.88 --> 964.90]  Like, the whole privacy legislation where, you know, basically it restricts your freedom
[964.90 --> 966.46]  online to do things creatively.
[966.46 --> 970.00]  But that's kind of annoying from a creative standpoint.
[970.00 --> 973.68]  But it's also helpful to some creators because it can...
[973.68 --> 977.62]  It means that your stuff isn't, you know, you're not taken advantage of.
[977.76 --> 978.62]  So...
[978.62 --> 985.24]  But I think overall, I think the EU is really going for a friendly to consumers type of
[985.24 --> 987.32]  approach where they're like, we're doing these things to help you.
[987.82 --> 988.92]  And I appreciate it.
[988.92 --> 994.64]  We might also have, like, an awkward generation or two of phones where it's like, they try
[994.64 --> 998.28]  to figure out how the heck to comply with being able to upgrade your phone.
[998.94 --> 999.22]  Right.
[1000.40 --> 1000.76]  Right.
[1000.92 --> 1001.62]  It's like, okay, wait.
[1002.06 --> 1003.22]  So we're gonna...
[1003.22 --> 1004.40]  Okay, it's gonna be a unibody.
[1004.62 --> 1007.70]  There's no back plate that you can take off to replace the battery.
[1008.36 --> 1013.78]  But you can take it into the store and we'll give you a new one.
[1014.16 --> 1018.04]  And it'll be like those funktastic ones from, like, China that the screen goes all the
[1018.04 --> 1020.16]  way around and, like, what are you going to do with those?
[1021.86 --> 1025.46]  And anyway, like, I'm pretty excited just because there's something like the Samsung
[1025.46 --> 1026.02]  S20.
[1026.18 --> 1031.18]  If I knew that I could, like, fix the battery, I might go out and buy one.
[1031.36 --> 1032.46]  It's like a thousand bucks.
[1033.20 --> 1036.22]  But if it's going to last me four years, it could be worth it.
[1036.26 --> 1040.78]  But if it's like the battery's going to die in two, two and a half years, I don't want
[1040.78 --> 1042.08]  to spend a thousand dollars on a phone.
[1042.30 --> 1042.66]  Exactly.
[1043.38 --> 1043.74]  Exactly.
[1044.42 --> 1046.70]  Like, and why would you when you can just buy a new phone?
[1046.70 --> 1050.36]  And this is what's so funny is that, like, we're coming around, like, we had this already.
[1050.46 --> 1054.94]  We already had phones that you could replace, like, completely repair and put the battery
[1054.94 --> 1055.34]  back in.
[1055.40 --> 1058.28]  And then for some reason, this is what I don't understand, guys, okay?
[1059.28 --> 1060.18]  This is what I don't get.
[1060.40 --> 1063.44]  I put a case on my phone as soon as I get a new one.
[1063.62 --> 1066.18]  As soon as I get a phone, a case goes on it.
[1066.44 --> 1067.62]  Can we stop caring?
[1068.54 --> 1072.64]  Can we decide as a society to stop caring about what phones look like?
[1072.64 --> 1075.46]  Like, so, because, like, I don't want a unibody.
[1075.80 --> 1076.98]  I want it to be functional.
[1077.32 --> 1078.16]  It's a tool.
[1078.28 --> 1079.06]  It's also a toy.
[1079.64 --> 1079.84]  Yeah.
[1079.90 --> 1084.42]  But, like, you know, I want to put a case on it so I can drop it and stuff.
[1085.06 --> 1091.38]  So, I guess the one more thing is if you have to take it apart, are you sacrificing
[1091.38 --> 1092.28]  waterproofness?
[1092.32 --> 1094.20]  I really like the fact that this is waterproof.
[1094.20 --> 1101.60]  I can, like, I don't know, go on a hike and toss it in my pocket and if it rains, it doesn't
[1101.60 --> 1101.92]  matter.
[1102.56 --> 1104.10]  But, like, I don't know.
[1104.18 --> 1106.20]  I had water kill one of my phones.
[1106.84 --> 1109.80]  It didn't totally kill it, but it killed, like, the USB circuitry.
[1109.90 --> 1110.88]  So, it basically killed it.
[1111.00 --> 1114.70]  But how hard is it to make a phone with, like, removable panels that's also waterproof?
[1114.96 --> 1115.56]  Like, are you...
[1115.56 --> 1117.26]  Making things waterproof is really tough.
[1117.32 --> 1118.40]  You're tough.
[1118.98 --> 1121.12]  Have you, like, I don't know.
[1121.12 --> 1124.54]  Have you experienced, like, any coffee mug ever?
[1124.86 --> 1125.82]  Like, the travel ones?
[1125.90 --> 1126.96]  I have experienced that.
[1126.96 --> 1128.20]  They leak all over the place.
[1128.40 --> 1129.72]  Well, if you get a bad one.
[1130.42 --> 1131.30]  Yeah, even the good ones.
[1131.34 --> 1132.22]  The good ones leak, too.
[1132.70 --> 1133.74]  I don't know where you're getting your coffee mugs.
[1133.74 --> 1134.64]  Just give them a little bit.
[1134.78 --> 1137.12]  I get my coffee mugs from Apple.
[1138.00 --> 1139.26]  You should say LTTstore.com.
[1139.52 --> 1140.30]  LTTstore.com.
[1140.62 --> 1141.64]  Wait, we have coffee mugs?
[1141.80 --> 1142.02]  No.
[1142.34 --> 1144.18]  These bottles, you know, they'll keep your stuff hot for a long time.
[1144.18 --> 1145.00]  Wait, do we have coffee mugs?
[1145.22 --> 1145.96]  No, we have...
[1145.96 --> 1147.28]  Is this an LTTstore spot?
[1147.46 --> 1148.58]  No, at the water bottles.
[1148.62 --> 1149.94]  Is this the sponsors right now?
[1150.06 --> 1150.46]  No, it's not.
[1150.46 --> 1151.22]  No, it's not.
[1152.12 --> 1153.54]  But I think we're working on mugs.
[1154.56 --> 1154.82]  Maybe.
[1154.94 --> 1155.26]  I don't know.
[1155.52 --> 1156.56]  But continue.
[1156.76 --> 1156.98]  Sorry.
[1157.26 --> 1158.14]  Coffee mugs suck.
[1159.18 --> 1160.16]  Because they always leak.
[1160.24 --> 1161.68]  It's really hard to make things waterproof.
[1161.74 --> 1162.60]  Okay, what about GoPros?
[1163.60 --> 1165.36]  Yeah, they have the big old case around them.
[1165.36 --> 1165.70]  No, no, no.
[1165.74 --> 1167.42]  But aren't they waterproof now?
[1167.82 --> 1169.84]  They've always been waterproof, but that's because they have...
[1169.84 --> 1170.64]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1170.68 --> 1171.54]  No, I'm looking this up.
[1172.20 --> 1173.08]  I'm looking this up.
[1173.46 --> 1173.70]  GoPro.
[1173.70 --> 1175.50]  Oh, you mean, like, the physical...
[1175.50 --> 1175.78]  Waterproof.
[1175.78 --> 1176.62]  Oh, yeah.
[1176.68 --> 1180.06]  Like, the GoPro itself is also waterproof, but you can't take it apart the same way.
[1181.14 --> 1184.10]  Yeah, the new ones are all waterproof without the case.
[1185.12 --> 1188.78]  The newer GoPro cameras are waterproof without a housing while the older units require a housing.
[1189.22 --> 1189.48]  Boom.
[1190.20 --> 1191.52]  Yeah, but I would be very curious.
[1191.52 --> 1192.60]  So it's easy as that, all right?
[1192.70 --> 1193.02]  Samsung?
[1194.94 --> 1195.60]  Samsung, Apple?
[1195.68 --> 1196.64]  Just go talk to GoPro.
[1196.84 --> 1197.46]  They know...
[1197.46 --> 1198.64]  They're very knowledgeable.
[1199.74 --> 1201.54]  Ask them how their drones are doing.
[1202.82 --> 1203.84]  How are their drones doing?
[1204.02 --> 1206.82]  I mean, I don't know how their drones are doing now, but a couple years ago, like, Karma,
[1206.96 --> 1208.64]  all their drones, like, fell from the sky.
[1208.90 --> 1211.76]  Like, an apocalyptic scenario.
[1213.50 --> 1213.82]  Oh.
[1213.92 --> 1215.00]  Oh, what else do we have here?
[1215.00 --> 1218.12]  For all the people asking where Linus and Luke are, they're not here.
[1218.58 --> 1219.20]  Really sorry.
[1219.20 --> 1221.00]  This is not a normal thing, though, so don't worry.
[1221.06 --> 1221.54]  They'll be back.
[1222.08 --> 1222.20]  Yeah.
[1223.58 --> 1224.28]  Moving on.
[1224.32 --> 1225.40]  I think it's time to move on, eh?
[1226.08 --> 1226.44]  Yes.
[1227.28 --> 1227.72]  What are we...
[1227.72 --> 1228.38]  Which one are we doing?
[1228.88 --> 1229.80]  I don't even know.
[1229.92 --> 1231.02]  Which one tickles you?
[1231.14 --> 1234.98]  I mean, okay, I want to talk about this Washington approving facial recognition a little bit.
[1235.12 --> 1235.42]  Okay.
[1235.84 --> 1241.96]  Because I've been following this kind of old, like, regulation of facial recognition issue
[1241.96 --> 1247.72]  a little bit, and it's interesting because this is another example of, like, companies
[1247.72 --> 1254.24]  wanting to do something and that clashing with, you know, the interests of consumers in the
[1254.24 --> 1260.92]  same way that the, you know, right to repair and, like, environmental aspect that we were
[1260.92 --> 1261.60]  just talking about.
[1261.60 --> 1263.48]  Facial recognition is really cool.
[1263.82 --> 1266.14]  It's a rapidly developing technology.
[1266.40 --> 1272.24]  But the problem is that a lot of the algorithms that it's based on end up being biased.
[1272.98 --> 1277.80]  So, like, they'll be a lot better at recognizing a certain type of person, like, you know, people
[1277.80 --> 1279.62]  of certain races or whatever.
[1279.62 --> 1282.92]  So, it's biased in that way.
[1283.06 --> 1285.42]  And also, a lot of it is still very inaccurate.
[1285.98 --> 1289.30]  But they're rolling it out in places.
[1289.42 --> 1290.92]  Like, in the UK, they're rolling it out.
[1291.14 --> 1293.00]  In certain areas of London, I think.
[1293.04 --> 1294.66]  I don't know if it's across all of London.
[1295.34 --> 1296.44]  But they're rolling it out.
[1297.06 --> 1299.88]  And it's got, like, an 80% error rate.
[1301.02 --> 1303.04]  Like, it gets, like, 2 out of 10 right or something.
[1303.70 --> 1309.82]  Well, there's this big problem with recognizing faces where you can easily train, like, an
[1309.82 --> 1314.72]  AI to recognize a group of, like, let's say, like, 10,000 people.
[1314.88 --> 1316.18]  It's, like, pretty easy.
[1316.28 --> 1318.34]  You'll be able to get it right pretty much every time.
[1318.54 --> 1320.64]  What do you mean it can recognize a group of, like?
[1320.68 --> 1322.56]  Like, it will be able to pick out an individual.
[1322.72 --> 1326.10]  It'll be, like, you show, like, a different picture or, like, a video of someone.
[1326.18 --> 1327.10]  And it'll be, like, it's that person.
[1327.36 --> 1328.10]  It nailed it.
[1328.22 --> 1328.50]  Okay.
[1328.50 --> 1334.24]  But as you make the sample size larger, this is, like, with a lot of AI stuff, you make
[1334.24 --> 1335.96]  the sample size larger and it just eats up the data.
[1336.04 --> 1337.60]  It's, like, and then it becomes way more accurate.
[1337.82 --> 1341.94]  But with facial recognition, it's kind of the opposite because you just get more faces
[1341.94 --> 1344.24]  that look the same in there.
[1344.36 --> 1348.44]  So as your sample size goes up, the accuracy can go down.
[1348.50 --> 1348.72]  Right.
[1348.76 --> 1351.06]  Because the chances of getting a false positive increases.
[1352.02 --> 1352.24]  Ah.
[1352.62 --> 1354.22]  Yeah, well, and that's the problem, isn't it?
[1354.96 --> 1356.32]  Yeah, there's that really fun one in London.
[1356.32 --> 1356.96]  What was it?
[1357.30 --> 1362.08]  There was the big fair, I believe, where there was a bunch of people attending and they
[1362.08 --> 1364.96]  used AI to try and pick out criminals.
[1366.02 --> 1369.18]  And it had a whole bunch of false positives.
[1369.66 --> 1375.72]  And the only correct one that it got was someone that was already, like, the police found him
[1375.72 --> 1376.24]  and got him.
[1377.70 --> 1378.10]  Oh.
[1378.32 --> 1379.82]  So they were like, oh, whoops.
[1380.30 --> 1383.54]  We were just out here wasting our time a little bit.
[1383.54 --> 1388.52]  So the development that we're talking about, the reason we're talking about facial recognition
[1388.52 --> 1396.78]  right now is because Washington state has approved, well, okay, it hasn't actually been signed
[1396.78 --> 1397.90]  into law by the governor yet.
[1398.00 --> 1400.92]  But the House and the Senate?
[1401.70 --> 1402.28]  Oh, geez.
[1402.38 --> 1405.02]  I don't know how, I forgot how American government works.
[1405.24 --> 1409.62]  But anyways, they got a bill basically to the point where it's approved where there are going
[1409.62 --> 1412.48]  to be strong regulations on how it's used.
[1412.90 --> 1418.72]  They are going to regulate how, which algorithms are used and how they're developed.
[1418.88 --> 1425.78]  And also, if law enforcement wants to use it, they will have to require a warrant to use it
[1425.78 --> 1426.92]  for, like, a specific thing.
[1427.00 --> 1430.50]  They're not going to be able to just kind of, like, post cameras up everywhere and scan everybody
[1430.50 --> 1431.22]  as they walk by.
[1431.28 --> 1431.92]  Okay, that's good.
[1431.92 --> 1435.18]  Which I think is, like, you know, maybe that's not the end goal.
[1435.30 --> 1442.00]  Like, I can understand how having facial recognition, you know, out there in public helps security
[1442.00 --> 1442.50]  or whatever.
[1442.68 --> 1442.90]  Yeah.
[1442.90 --> 1448.14]  And, like, maybe if we regulate it enough, we can get it to that point where, okay, it's
[1448.14 --> 1449.38]  100% accurate or something.
[1449.82 --> 1453.02]  And, like, we know that there's going to be no false positives and we know that it's not
[1453.02 --> 1454.20]  going to infringe on people's privacy.
[1454.40 --> 1455.98]  I don't know if that's possible, okay?
[1456.14 --> 1457.88]  I'm not a facial scientist.
[1458.66 --> 1465.00]  But I think that this is an important step to, like, take it slow, you know?
[1465.22 --> 1468.62]  Okay, we're not super comfortable with exactly how this is working yet.
[1468.70 --> 1471.62]  So let's just be careful here, all right?
[1471.62 --> 1477.44]  Let's pass some legislation and let's make sure that it's being developed in the right
[1477.44 --> 1477.96]  way.
[1479.54 --> 1483.44]  I don't know if we need any other details about that.
[1486.06 --> 1486.50]  Yeah.
[1486.66 --> 1488.38]  I think that's basically it for that.
[1489.08 --> 1489.64]  Okay, anyways.
[1490.36 --> 1491.94]  Now you want to talk about something.
[1492.02 --> 1492.42]  I know you didn't.
[1492.74 --> 1493.54]  I did, yes.
[1493.76 --> 1493.88]  Oh.
[1494.46 --> 1495.02]  What are you going to do?
[1495.18 --> 1496.32]  Honeywell, we got quantum.
[1496.38 --> 1497.68]  We're getting quantum in here.
[1497.68 --> 1503.62]  This is mostly just because it feels like it's just kind of out of nowhere.
[1504.02 --> 1507.30]  Honeywell apparently has quantum supremacy now.
[1507.30 --> 1507.42]  Yeah, what?
[1507.56 --> 1508.74]  Okay, I don't really know.
[1509.48 --> 1511.62]  Maybe this is, like, embarrassing.
[1511.80 --> 1513.10]  But what does Honeywell make?
[1513.18 --> 1513.88]  Like, fridges?
[1514.26 --> 1516.00]  Yeah, they make, like, thermostats.
[1516.14 --> 1516.52]  Okay.
[1516.52 --> 1520.08]  And this is coming courtesy of RC Mail.
[1520.72 --> 1521.00]  Mail?
[1521.98 --> 1523.40]  Sorry, I don't know how to say your name.
[1523.78 --> 1525.58]  On the forum, thanks for the contribution.
[1525.84 --> 1526.80]  Anyways, Honeywell.
[1528.04 --> 1535.06]  Yeah, so basically how it works is, you know, most quantum computers, they work using super
[1535.06 --> 1536.06]  conducting qubits.
[1536.06 --> 1542.56]  So I did, like, three minutes Googling this, so I apologize for brutalizing it for the small
[1542.56 --> 1544.16]  number of people that are quantum experts.
[1544.32 --> 1544.68]  Destroy!
[1544.88 --> 1545.38]  That are listening.
[1545.86 --> 1550.84]  But basically, you know, normally with a quantum computer, you have a very thin ring of aluminum
[1550.84 --> 1553.72]  that is chilled until it becomes a superconductor.
[1554.16 --> 1558.14]  And then, like, you know, current just starts flowing in it because it's a superconductor.
[1559.06 --> 1564.42]  And they're able to do stuff that basically allows for the current to flow in both directions
[1564.42 --> 1565.36]  at one time.
[1566.12 --> 1571.88]  And I think that there's an issue with that because you're not able to read it while you're,
[1572.00 --> 1572.98]  like, running the stuff.
[1573.78 --> 1574.18]  Oh, no.
[1574.66 --> 1574.96]  Yeah.
[1576.24 --> 1577.64]  Great explanation, Alex.
[1578.06 --> 1581.48]  So the one from Honeywell, they instead use ion traps.
[1581.62 --> 1584.34]  So they have strontium or something along those lines.
[1584.46 --> 1586.80]  Can I just say that sounds, like, super sci-fi?
[1587.22 --> 1587.48]  Yeah.
[1588.16 --> 1589.98]  We have to get past the ion traps.
[1590.84 --> 1591.14]  Continue.
[1591.14 --> 1599.22]  And so then, well, it's kind of, like, trapped dangling there by electricity above, like,
[1599.32 --> 1601.20]  a gold film or, like, a gold strip.
[1601.42 --> 1601.74]  Right.
[1601.88 --> 1605.48]  They're able to change it from a state of zero to one.
[1605.48 --> 1607.72]  And then they have a laser that reads the atoms.
[1608.16 --> 1610.28]  And so basically, if it's in state zero, it does nothing.
[1610.38 --> 1611.72]  But if it's in state one, it emits a photon.
[1612.00 --> 1613.92]  And boop-de-boop, you find out what it's doing.
[1614.38 --> 1617.02]  So the fun thing about that is they're able to create if loops.
[1617.60 --> 1618.38]  If loops?
[1618.68 --> 1618.92]  Yes.
[1618.92 --> 1620.28]  Is that, like, if this, then that?
[1620.36 --> 1620.52]  Yeah.
[1620.90 --> 1621.90]  I know about that.
[1622.20 --> 1623.68]  And so apparently that's great.
[1624.58 --> 1626.10]  I could have told you that.
[1628.24 --> 1634.16]  So anyway, to build this quantum computer, Honeywell partnered with J.P. Morgan.
[1635.08 --> 1636.58]  Another one where it's like, what?
[1637.30 --> 1641.66]  I don't even know what J.P. Morgan does, but I know they're in the finance industry somewhere.
[1641.98 --> 1643.26]  And also Microsoft.
[1643.54 --> 1644.64]  Oh, that's a bank, isn't it?
[1645.60 --> 1646.20]  Uh, yes.
[1647.14 --> 1648.96]  These WAN shows are horrible for me.
[1649.68 --> 1653.18]  Everyone just finds out that I know nothing about banks.
[1653.42 --> 1662.62]  Yeah, it turns out Honeywell does a lot of stuff in defense and aerospace and has a lot of expertise in vacuums and cryogenics, which is how they were able to do this.
[1662.78 --> 1663.42]  Honeywell does?
[1663.56 --> 1664.10]  Honeywell does.
[1664.10 --> 1669.32]  Man, they have such an innocuous name for, like, for being involved in that kind of stuff.
[1669.32 --> 1673.58]  Like, I think of, you know, I don't even have much brand awareness of what Honeywell is.
[1673.58 --> 1677.70]  But, like, if I had to guess, I would be like, I see, like, a Honeywell toaster one time.
[1678.14 --> 1678.64]  Yeah, like.
[1678.74 --> 1681.48]  Turns out they're making secret super soldiers in labs.
[1682.32 --> 1686.20]  Okay, now why is this particular configuration for a quantum computer?
[1686.28 --> 1687.06]  Why is that a big deal?
[1687.10 --> 1689.76]  Why does that make that more powerful than, like, a traditional one?
[1689.76 --> 1694.66]  I think that it's just because it's easier to make a whole bunch of them and run them in parallel.
[1695.10 --> 1695.48]  Okay.
[1696.08 --> 1699.46]  And it's easier to, like, start and stop it.
[1700.74 --> 1704.66]  So will they achieve quantum supremacy?
[1706.26 --> 1707.76]  They have a paper.
[1708.30 --> 1712.50]  I have it in the doc as paper by Honeywell for Super Nerds.
[1712.50 --> 1712.94]  Oh.
[1713.46 --> 1718.36]  And they claim that they have quantum supremacy, but it hasn't been verified by other people.
[1718.80 --> 1725.54]  Oh, so they're, like, actually being kind of a, they're actually kind of being a bit humble about it instead of Google, who's just like, we did it!
[1726.44 --> 1728.32]  I don't know if they would be humble.
[1728.44 --> 1731.36]  The reports that I have said were, like, we'll wait for a second.
[1731.74 --> 1732.58]  I'm on your screen now.
[1732.74 --> 1733.18]  Oh, you are?
[1733.18 --> 1733.90]  You can show the people.
[1734.14 --> 1735.32]  What are you looking at, Alex?
[1735.32 --> 1738.42]  I'm looking at this paper that I honestly don't understand.
[1738.42 --> 1743.56]  I feel like, okay, there might be a few people in the chat.
[1743.82 --> 1751.50]  If you're a quantum scientist in the chat, let us know that you think that we're talking nonsense.
[1751.94 --> 1755.36]  But otherwise, I think most people here have no idea what the heck.
[1755.42 --> 1756.80]  Yeah, let's see what wisdom we have here.
[1756.96 --> 1763.52]  Tommy Gunn9228 says, don't want to be rude, but Riley's mustache makes him look like an 80s porn star.
[1763.76 --> 1765.22]  But I like that style.
[1765.38 --> 1767.08]  That's the, that's, well, it's not the idea.
[1767.08 --> 1767.86]  And hi, Alex.
[1767.86 --> 1768.90]  I accept it.
[1768.90 --> 1770.90]  So, uh, lots of insight there.
[1771.08 --> 1772.04]  Oh, J.P. Morgan Chase.
[1772.32 --> 1773.12]  Is that what you said?
[1773.18 --> 1773.28]  Yeah.
[1773.52 --> 1774.86]  Like Chase, the bank Chase.
[1775.42 --> 1775.72]  Yeah.
[1775.90 --> 1776.84]  Here's the other thing, guys.
[1776.88 --> 1779.36]  We're Canadians, so we don't have, I don't think we have Chase.
[1780.52 --> 1784.62]  And maybe J.P. Morgan's involved in some stuff up here, but it's not like a household name.
[1784.68 --> 1786.46]  Or maybe if you're on the stock market.
[1786.70 --> 1787.54]  I don't know.
[1788.36 --> 1790.06]  I should, I'm with a credit union.
[1792.18 --> 1792.50]  Okay.
[1793.04 --> 1796.38]  Neuro, we got a neuroscientist in the chat, but that's not going to help us.
[1796.38 --> 1798.66]  I mean, maybe it will.
[1799.10 --> 1802.18]  Maybe consciousness is based on quantum mechanics.
[1802.18 --> 1803.18]  Did you ever think about that?
[1803.42 --> 1807.76]  Or maybe they're building quantum mechanics, so it's more like based off of consciousness.
[1808.14 --> 1809.16]  I think that's kind of the point.
[1809.32 --> 1809.44]  Yeah.
[1809.90 --> 1810.80]  Neuromorphic computing.
[1811.02 --> 1811.28]  Yeah.
[1811.52 --> 1812.14]  Dang, dude.
[1812.14 --> 1818.40]  I mean, if that's not time to talk about our sponsors, then I don't know what it is.
[1819.04 --> 1819.36]  Where am I?
[1819.48 --> 1820.78]  What am I on here?
[1821.42 --> 1822.22]  It's time to talk.
[1822.36 --> 1822.54]  What?
[1822.82 --> 1824.06]  Do you have more to say about quantum?
[1824.20 --> 1824.22]  No.
[1824.22 --> 1828.54]  Someone says quantum supremacy means that they can build an AI that will dominate the world,
[1828.60 --> 1828.76]  right?
[1829.98 --> 1830.28]  No.
[1830.36 --> 1831.76]  I think it just means that they built the best one.
[1831.80 --> 1833.04]  I think they just mean...
[1833.04 --> 1833.94]  No, no, no, no.
[1834.02 --> 1834.16]  No.
[1834.22 --> 1836.02]  Quantum supremacy, I know what this is.
[1836.08 --> 1836.82]  Do you know what it is?
[1837.16 --> 1837.74]  Clearly not.
[1837.88 --> 1838.24]  Ha ha.
[1838.80 --> 1840.54]  This is something Riley knows about.
[1841.16 --> 1848.12]  Quantum supremacy is the point at which a quantum computer can do something better than
[1848.12 --> 1850.06]  a traditional computer or something.
[1850.26 --> 1850.50]  Oh, okay.
[1850.82 --> 1851.96]  Something along those lines.
[1851.96 --> 1852.62]  Okay, look.
[1853.32 --> 1855.92]  Now somebody's going to say what the actual definition is in the chant.
[1856.22 --> 1856.94]  Oh, here we got.
[1858.94 --> 1861.02]  Lebesguemeasure 101 says,
[1861.20 --> 1865.02]  In quantum computing, quantum supremacy is the goal of demonstrating that a programmable
[1865.02 --> 1868.86]  quantum device can solve a problem that classical computers practically cannot.
[1869.06 --> 1869.72]  Okay, there we go.
[1869.96 --> 1870.06]  Cool.
[1870.06 --> 1871.08]  So it's not that they do it better.
[1871.22 --> 1874.46]  It's that they do something that our computers now can't even do at all.
[1875.42 --> 1883.48]  So Google said that they had achieved it, but then turns out that, okay, well, they didn't...
[1883.48 --> 1885.78]  Our computers could do what their computer did.
[1885.84 --> 1887.18]  It would just take like a while.
[1887.84 --> 1894.16]  Oh, and someone in the chat asked, like, normal quantum computing needs cooling to be a superconductor.
[1894.16 --> 1894.84]  Does this need it?
[1895.34 --> 1896.02]  Basically, yes.
[1896.04 --> 1896.98]  It's under a vacuum.
[1897.12 --> 1898.02]  It's super duper cold.
[1898.26 --> 1898.48]  Right.
[1898.60 --> 1904.02]  It's maybe slightly easier to make, but it's still, you know, you're not making it in your
[1904.02 --> 1904.30]  basement.
[1904.38 --> 1905.48]  Unless you're that one kid that did.
[1905.92 --> 1906.18]  What?
[1906.44 --> 1907.58]  Yeah, there's like an 11-year-old.
[1907.74 --> 1910.16]  Somebody made a quantum computer in their basement?
[1910.84 --> 1914.06]  Well, I think it was like in his living room, but it was like pretty wild.
[1914.50 --> 1915.44]  Is this Stranger Things?
[1916.20 --> 1916.58]  Yeah, like...
[1916.58 --> 1917.16]  Sounds like something...
[1917.98 --> 1919.10]  I have made life!
[1921.62 --> 1921.98]  Okay.
[1921.98 --> 1925.52]  Anyway, that's super cool.
[1925.66 --> 1928.54]  If you're the guy who made a quantum computer in your basement, congratulations.
[1929.10 --> 1929.92]  I'm proud of you.
[1932.18 --> 1932.94]  That's amazing.
[1934.78 --> 1937.08]  Hey, it's time to talk about our sponsors real quick.
[1937.20 --> 1938.36]  Hey, guess what?
[1938.58 --> 1939.32]  Guess what, Alex?
[1939.72 --> 1940.26]  Yeah, what?
[1941.10 --> 1942.22]  FreshBooks is a thing.
[1942.32 --> 1942.62]  Yay!
[1942.82 --> 1943.70]  And we love them.
[1944.16 --> 1949.08]  FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that does more than just help you create
[1949.08 --> 1950.32]  slick-looking invoices.
[1950.56 --> 1954.90]  It also helps you track your time with their timesheet function, manage your expenses, keep
[1954.90 --> 1959.44]  track of who owes you what, and the mobile app has all the functionality of their desktop
[1959.44 --> 1960.02]  version as well.
[1960.08 --> 1962.16]  You can do all this on the toilet if you really want to.
[1962.28 --> 1962.60]  Wow.
[1963.14 --> 1964.72]  Have you ever made an invoice on the toilet?
[1965.48 --> 1966.10]  Now you can.
[1966.10 --> 1969.48]  You can do it with FreshBooks.
[1969.92 --> 1973.48]  The mobile, call their support staff and talk to a real human as well.
[1973.64 --> 1976.54]  It's not just like, you know, digital facts and stuff like that.
[1976.80 --> 1982.54]  Get 50% off your first three months of FreshBooks when you sign up for a paid plan at freshbooks.com
[1982.54 --> 1984.36]  forward slash WAN.
[1984.78 --> 1990.10]  If you're a freelance person or a person who sends invoices for things, it's super useful.
[1991.00 --> 1992.16]  I can imagine so.
[1992.20 --> 1992.64]  Trust me.
[1992.64 --> 1997.28]  I've actually seen like, when I was back in Nova Scotia, I worked for a guy that was
[1997.28 --> 1998.56]  like roofing things.
[1998.66 --> 1998.90]  Oh, yeah?
[1999.08 --> 2003.34]  And like generally, you know, actually it was like a pretty bad time because there's a bunch
[2003.34 --> 2007.44]  of old houses there and then like, you know, you go and try to repair one and it's full
[2007.44 --> 2007.80]  of ants.
[2008.22 --> 2011.06]  But anyway, he was just using like an Excel document.
[2011.16 --> 2012.12]  It was a horrible time.
[2012.14 --> 2012.34]  Yeah, yeah.
[2012.34 --> 2013.16]  He really could have used it.
[2013.28 --> 2017.42]  When I worked back for NCIX, I was a contractor for a little bit and I was trying to make invoices
[2017.42 --> 2019.12]  every time on Excel.
[2019.12 --> 2021.66]  And it's not that hard, but like it just takes time.
[2021.94 --> 2022.00]  Yeah.
[2022.00 --> 2024.98]  You know, with the service, you know, you can just make an invoice, right?
[2025.18 --> 2026.50]  I don't even need to do that.
[2026.76 --> 2027.50]  What do we have here?
[2027.58 --> 2028.08]  Savage jerky.
[2028.24 --> 2028.40]  Yeah.
[2028.48 --> 2028.88]  What do we got?
[2029.02 --> 2032.20]  We have habanero buffalo sauce, mojo habanero, sriracha.
[2032.36 --> 2033.04]  Which one's the hottest?
[2033.24 --> 2035.34]  I have tried the spiciest one before.
[2035.42 --> 2035.56]  Yeah.
[2035.82 --> 2038.88]  And I can say that I tried it, so I don't need to try it now.
[2039.28 --> 2040.64]  I'm going to have a...
[2040.64 --> 2042.64]  Oh no, which one of these is...
[2042.64 --> 2044.92]  I've tried the spiciest one before.
[2044.94 --> 2045.72]  Wait, what do we got here?
[2045.86 --> 2046.18]  We got...
[2046.18 --> 2047.38]  I don't know which ones these are.
[2047.54 --> 2048.70]  Habanero buffalo sauce.
[2048.70 --> 2049.34]  That's hot.
[2049.34 --> 2051.06]  Sriracha teriyaki.
[2051.20 --> 2051.88]  That's medium.
[2052.50 --> 2054.02]  I'm going right for the mojo habanero.
[2054.36 --> 2055.00]  Oh, jeez.
[2055.10 --> 2056.40]  I think this is one of the harder ones for sure.
[2056.46 --> 2058.18]  Yeah, I guess I'm doing the sriracha teriyaki.
[2059.16 --> 2059.74]  Savage jerky.
[2060.06 --> 2061.94]  It's made with the best ingredients, guys.
[2062.14 --> 2063.22]  There's no nitrates.
[2063.48 --> 2064.64]  There's no preservatives.
[2064.64 --> 2069.92]  And their goal is to create a snack that is full of flavor and spice that isn't bad for you.
[2070.06 --> 2070.80]  Because that's hard.
[2071.26 --> 2071.48]  Yeah.
[2072.22 --> 2074.64]  You can create something that's super tasty, but...
[2075.80 --> 2076.54]  That one's a bit hot.
[2076.98 --> 2077.62]  That one's definitely hot.
[2077.68 --> 2078.66]  Yeah, why'd you do that?
[2079.40 --> 2080.20]  I kind of want some more, though.
[2080.44 --> 2080.62]  What?
[2080.64 --> 2081.18]  It's really tasty.
[2081.28 --> 2081.98]  What's wrong with you?
[2082.48 --> 2082.98]  I mean...
[2082.98 --> 2083.18]  I don't know.
[2083.24 --> 2084.40]  What's right with you?
[2084.72 --> 2086.16]  Can I also have some of the other ones?
[2086.60 --> 2087.74]  Oh, jeez, that's way too much.
[2087.86 --> 2087.96]  Jeez, Louise.
[2088.82 --> 2090.08]  I'm a little snack related.
[2090.08 --> 2095.12]  So we got three flavors here, but they got 13 different flavors of jerky, such as the ones that we just said.
[2095.26 --> 2097.62]  And Linus' favorite is maple buffalo bacon, apparently.
[2097.82 --> 2098.90]  That one's actually really tasty.
[2099.50 --> 2102.52]  And they also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and a spice rub.
[2102.98 --> 2103.26]  Mmm.
[2103.60 --> 2105.54]  For those intimate moments.
[2107.24 --> 2107.68]  What?
[2108.40 --> 2111.44]  Their Carolina Reaper hot sauce is one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[2111.56 --> 2116.56]  And you can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all of their products.
[2116.98 --> 2118.40]  You get 10% off some jerky.
[2118.40 --> 2122.88]  And then, you know, have some jerky, go back to what you're doing.
[2124.04 --> 2124.72]  Why not?
[2125.20 --> 2127.78]  And also, wait, we were supposed to say this now, too?
[2127.92 --> 2129.04]  The LTT folding thing?
[2129.08 --> 2129.58]  Or is that later?
[2130.30 --> 2130.50]  What?
[2130.98 --> 2132.36]  Oh, we should probably just do that right now, anyway.
[2132.56 --> 2133.30]  LTT folding.
[2133.66 --> 2136.36]  If you do folding with your computer, do you know what folding is?
[2136.84 --> 2137.34]  It's great.
[2137.46 --> 2138.04]  It's the best thing.
[2138.38 --> 2141.60]  You use your computer, spare computing power, and you fold proteins.
[2141.60 --> 2146.50]  Well, you simulate folding of proteins, and it helps, you know, researchers do research.
[2147.08 --> 2148.14]  Well, right now there's a big push.
[2148.40 --> 2150.92]  You know, there's that virus that's been going around.
[2150.92 --> 2155.70]  That thing that's happening that is really we can't super talk about very openly.
[2155.92 --> 2157.16]  Thank you, demonetization.
[2157.16 --> 2157.64]  Thanks, YouTube.
[2158.02 --> 2158.38]  Anyways.
[2159.40 --> 2161.20]  But, yeah, there's a big push on there.
[2162.14 --> 2164.04]  So if you have a GPU, like I'm going to be going home.
[2164.10 --> 2164.98]  I'm going to be setting up.
[2165.92 --> 2168.06]  I have, like, two computers that I don't use a whole lot.
[2168.06 --> 2169.16]  I'm just going to set them to fold.
[2169.96 --> 2170.38]  Yeah, do it.
[2170.38 --> 2171.58]  One thing I would strongly recommend.
[2171.58 --> 2173.72]  Wow, that's a bit of heat.
[2174.88 --> 2175.66]  Oh, boy.
[2176.20 --> 2180.94]  One thing that I would strongly recommend if you're starting folding, make sure that your
[2180.94 --> 2182.62]  temps aren't super duper high.
[2182.68 --> 2188.12]  You don't want to be running, like, your GPU at 100 degrees, like, for a super long amount
[2188.12 --> 2188.36]  of time.
[2188.42 --> 2195.58]  So just, you know, go in, make sure, like, with hardware info that you're not doing anything
[2195.58 --> 2196.60]  super duper crazy.
[2196.82 --> 2202.26]  And then, you know, you can go into the folding at home thing, set it to, like, only use 70%
[2202.26 --> 2202.64]  GPU.
[2202.74 --> 2205.74]  And then maybe your temps drop a bunch and do it there.
[2205.84 --> 2206.48]  Excellent time.
[2206.80 --> 2209.04]  Then you don't have it for you, but, like, you know, it hurting your hardware.
[2209.90 --> 2211.08]  And it's just generally awesome.
[2211.08 --> 2217.58]  There's, you know, going towards getting a vaccine is an awesome thing to do these days.
[2217.58 --> 2221.88]  And it's not free unless, you know, your landlords pay for your power.
[2223.36 --> 2224.60]  But it's not that bad.
[2225.18 --> 2227.60]  It's not that bad at all.
[2227.62 --> 2231.36]  It's very worth it for, you know, the general good of humankind.
[2231.62 --> 2233.02]  I don't have the right link here.
[2233.60 --> 2233.88]  What?
[2234.02 --> 2234.50]  What the heck?
[2236.88 --> 2237.60]  That's annoying.
[2238.72 --> 2240.50]  Are we able to post it in the thing?
[2241.52 --> 2247.44]  Yeah, we can post the, uh, we're supposed to post the, um, post this link in chat.
[2247.54 --> 2250.08]  Now that goes to the PCMR.
[2251.40 --> 2252.40]  Uh, this one.
[2252.64 --> 2252.92]  Boom.
[2253.90 --> 2254.96]  Now it's on Twitch.
[2255.82 --> 2258.52]  Now it's on YouTube.
[2259.88 --> 2260.66]  Post it a bunch.
[2260.78 --> 2261.56]  It'll get lost in there.
[2263.16 --> 2266.50]  I don't know how to post it on Floplink because I've never looked at this before.
[2266.94 --> 2268.64]  But anyways, um, yeah.
[2268.64 --> 2268.72]  Yeah.
[2269.08 --> 2269.74]  Help it out.
[2269.80 --> 2272.40]  Help the people out who are doing the research on stuff.
[2272.42 --> 2273.36]  Post it a couple more times.
[2273.44 --> 2273.56]  What?
[2273.62 --> 2273.92]  One more time?
[2273.94 --> 2274.46]  Just spam it.
[2274.82 --> 2275.30]  Spam it.
[2276.92 --> 2277.58]  There we go.
[2278.32 --> 2278.64]  Perfect.
[2278.74 --> 2279.80]  Can't you get banned for that?
[2279.90 --> 2281.84]  Can you get banned for spamming your own chat?
[2282.06 --> 2282.82]  I don't think so.
[2283.40 --> 2284.12]  That would be pretty funny.
[2284.12 --> 2287.26]  Um, okay.
[2288.40 --> 2289.22]  Very cool.
[2289.74 --> 2290.04]  Oh, wait.
[2290.12 --> 2292.08]  I can post it in Flipplane right now.
[2292.80 --> 2297.84]  Now that links, see, now I feel bad because that links to the PCMR, you know, official
[2297.84 --> 2299.68]  PCMR folding thing that's happening.
[2299.78 --> 2300.86]  And maybe it's affiliated.
[2300.86 --> 2304.32]  I actually didn't get a chance to look at it very deeply.
[2304.46 --> 2310.04]  But I know that on the LTT forum, we're also doing, uh, folding to help with, uh, I think
[2310.04 --> 2311.02]  if we can say it, right?
[2311.10 --> 2312.06]  Can we say the name?
[2313.36 --> 2314.62]  The thing that's bad.
[2314.80 --> 2315.72]  You know, everybody knows.
[2315.72 --> 2316.90]  You know, the thing that's happening.
[2317.60 --> 2320.54]  Um, so it's, uh, it's going to do research for that.
[2320.88 --> 2321.62]  Wait, what's over here?
[2321.80 --> 2322.82]  Are you clicked on that too?
[2323.32 --> 2325.06]  I want, oh yeah.
[2325.26 --> 2326.74]  I just copied it over.
[2326.74 --> 2327.22]  Okay.
[2327.52 --> 2328.84]  So use your computer.
[2330.08 --> 2331.08]  Moving on.
[2332.28 --> 2334.00]  Do you want to talk about the Facebook thing?
[2334.94 --> 2335.80]  Uh, kind of.
[2335.84 --> 2336.26]  I don't know.
[2336.56 --> 2337.66]  Do you have something to say about that?
[2338.06 --> 2338.82]  Not particularly.
[2339.04 --> 2343.42]  For you guys that don't know, um, Facebook broke privacy laws.
[2343.54 --> 2344.20]  Big surprise.
[2344.74 --> 2346.26]  Nobody heard about that one.
[2346.36 --> 2347.28]  Cambridge Analytica.
[2347.46 --> 2348.06]  It was bad.
[2348.40 --> 2353.14]  Australia is saying that, you know, they could be sued up to $529 billion.
[2353.66 --> 2355.74]  That would be pretty bad, which is...
[2355.74 --> 2363.04]  Also, you know, pretty great because I guess the UK only fined them for 500,000 pounds.
[2363.34 --> 2363.92]  That's like nothing.
[2364.50 --> 2365.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[2366.14 --> 2369.52]  So good job, Australia, I guess, for maybe.
[2370.00 --> 2371.30]  But they probably won't end up doing it.
[2371.44 --> 2372.44]  So, uh, who knows.
[2372.56 --> 2376.02]  I saw this earlier and I was kind of like, okay.
[2376.64 --> 2379.28]  Maybe it's just because I'm so, you know...
[2379.28 --> 2379.84]  Oh, here we go.
[2379.90 --> 2380.32]  I'll click through.
[2380.46 --> 2383.18]  Thanks, Slimey Python, for the post in the forum.
[2383.18 --> 2388.94]  I saw this and maybe it's just because I'm so, uh, what do you call it?
[2389.00 --> 2389.48]  Desensitized?
[2389.48 --> 2389.72]  Yeah.
[2390.02 --> 2393.72]  To Facebook being fined and like doing privacy violations.
[2394.24 --> 2395.96]  Like, I say this and I'm like...
[2395.96 --> 2399.64]  Yeah, it's like Intel having like bad backdoor stuff.
[2399.64 --> 2399.82]  Yeah.
[2399.98 --> 2406.48]  And the crazy thing is that it says the fine could scale up to $529 billion.
[2407.28 --> 2415.98]  But in the article, I'm not sure if it's this article or another article, they said that basically they probably won't have to do that.
[2415.98 --> 2417.38]  Oh, no.
[2418.08 --> 2419.84]  Alex, our SEO rankings are dropping.
[2421.34 --> 2421.74]  No!
[2424.40 --> 2431.40]  Anyways, they said that they basically, they probably won't have to pay this fine because, um, you know, they haven't paid...
[2431.40 --> 2434.16]  They have been fined other times, but they have really good lawyers.
[2434.50 --> 2434.72]  Yeah.
[2434.94 --> 2436.10]  So, I don't know.
[2436.20 --> 2438.04]  Maybe I should care more about these kind of things.
[2438.62 --> 2438.92]  Maybe.
[2439.10 --> 2439.66]  Or maybe not.
[2439.66 --> 2443.08]  It's also Australia suing them.
[2443.36 --> 2443.60]  Yeah.
[2444.14 --> 2445.62]  And also like...
[2445.62 --> 2446.70]  Do you use Facebook anymore?
[2446.88 --> 2448.36]  Do I use Facebook in Australia?
[2450.26 --> 2451.28]  Well, but just like period.
[2451.48 --> 2452.40]  Do you use Facebook anymore?
[2453.14 --> 2459.76]  I don't, I don't really use it unless, uh, except for like specific things to go on there and like, like marketplace.
[2460.10 --> 2461.00]  Yeah, I use it for marketplace.
[2461.00 --> 2465.66]  Or, uh, you know, to, to deal with our LTT Facebook pages that we have.
[2465.66 --> 2466.28]  Freaking marketplace.
[2466.78 --> 2468.16]  Freaking marketplace, bud.
[2468.16 --> 2470.10]  I was supposed to get a mini fridge tonight.
[2471.00 --> 2472.60]  But he just hasn't messaged me back.
[2472.92 --> 2473.88]  I'm kind of mad about it.
[2473.90 --> 2475.38]  Now you're calling him out on Wancho.
[2475.40 --> 2475.84]  I, yep.
[2476.06 --> 2480.40]  I have a platform and I will use it to call out you, username, whatever you're...
[2480.40 --> 2483.12]  I had a plan for this weekend that involved that mini fridge.
[2483.38 --> 2485.48]  Now I cannot keep my things chill.
[2485.92 --> 2486.16]  Yep.
[2486.70 --> 2489.82]  I was going to try and make dry-aged steaks and now I can't.
[2489.90 --> 2494.26]  Oh, man, you're gonna have to have regular steaks like a frigging chump.
[2495.62 --> 2496.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2496.50 --> 2497.84]  All right, what else we got here?
[2498.16 --> 2499.98]  Um, YouTube ditches the trending tab.
[2500.04 --> 2501.46]  Okay, you put this into the document.
[2501.46 --> 2501.72]  I did.
[2501.72 --> 2502.72]  And I didn't understand why.
[2502.76 --> 2505.68]  Honestly, I put it in here because I thought that Linus would go off.
[2505.74 --> 2506.40]  Oh, yeah.
[2507.02 --> 2509.30]  Because if Linus was here, he would definitely have something to say.
[2509.30 --> 2513.42]  Yeah, he'd have something really like, really very...
[2513.42 --> 2514.32]  What would you call that?
[2516.60 --> 2517.12]  Inflammatory?
[2517.12 --> 2521.54]  Something that most people would not care about and really probably shouldn't.
[2521.80 --> 2523.18]  So, what does this mean?
[2523.18 --> 2526.54]  But anyway, you click on it and now instead you get...
[2526.54 --> 2526.90]  Oh, no.
[2526.98 --> 2528.80]  There's like trending, gaming, movies and shows.
[2528.82 --> 2529.34]  Are you trying to show?
[2529.58 --> 2530.22]  I wasn't on there.
[2530.26 --> 2530.96]  Oh, you weren't on there?
[2531.06 --> 2531.50]  Okay, yeah.
[2531.56 --> 2532.18]  Now you're good.
[2532.18 --> 2536.52]  Instead of hitting trending where it just shows you like Jimmy Kimmel and who we interviewed
[2536.52 --> 2538.84]  that day, you now get...
[2538.84 --> 2543.06]  I guess Van Wives is being, you know, shown off.
[2543.46 --> 2546.16]  There's apparently going to be more creator content on here.
[2546.22 --> 2547.56]  It actually looks like it is.
[2548.26 --> 2550.84]  It's pretty much all CNN and ABC, MSNBC.
[2550.84 --> 2553.52]  They're trying, apparently.
[2554.18 --> 2559.62]  You also get these tabs for trending, gaming, movies, learning, music, news, fashion and
[2559.62 --> 2559.84]  beauty.
[2560.04 --> 2561.14]  No tech yet.
[2561.62 --> 2561.92]  Right.
[2562.36 --> 2563.48]  But is this what you wrote?
[2563.56 --> 2565.94]  Apparently more hubs will be added soon, maybe tech?
[2566.46 --> 2567.32]  So then we'll...
[2567.32 --> 2570.22]  Wait, but that's just going to be annoying to have like a million tabs along the bottom
[2570.22 --> 2570.96]  of the YouTube app.
[2571.78 --> 2573.44]  Well, it's only in the Explore tab.
[2573.54 --> 2578.70]  Actually, if you click on Explore right now, it just shows us in gaming.
[2579.00 --> 2580.18]  So, there you go.
[2580.18 --> 2581.48]  Us and gaming?
[2581.64 --> 2584.50]  No, like it shows us that like we're live.
[2585.04 --> 2585.30]  Oh.
[2586.18 --> 2587.50]  Wait, we're live right now?
[2587.78 --> 2588.98]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[2590.40 --> 2592.50]  Yeah, that's cool.
[2593.06 --> 2593.40]  Yeah.
[2593.66 --> 2594.64]  That's really cool.
[2595.38 --> 2600.90]  It's good anytime that they try to do stuff that doesn't only show old people media.
[2602.08 --> 2602.48]  Right.
[2603.08 --> 2604.08]  Okay, so that is...
[2604.08 --> 2604.96]  Wait, yeah, that's interesting.
[2605.06 --> 2608.62]  That's something I didn't really think about because trending has like often gets basically
[2608.62 --> 2610.84]  just taken over by, you know, NBC or something.
[2611.00 --> 2611.20]  Yeah.
[2611.42 --> 2612.10]  Also us.
[2612.76 --> 2613.36]  We take...
[2613.36 --> 2614.98]  Yeah, we have like really high...
[2614.98 --> 2616.14]  But that's not us, you know.
[2616.44 --> 2618.56]  We don't have any say in that.
[2618.64 --> 2620.98]  We just end up on trending because we're freaking amazing.
[2621.36 --> 2622.66]  Well, and also just because like...
[2622.66 --> 2623.04]  That was a joke.
[2623.04 --> 2624.60]  We're friendly apparently.
[2625.38 --> 2627.04]  So, we're just put on there all the time.
[2629.10 --> 2630.84]  We're pretty friendly, I guess.
[2630.96 --> 2631.46]  Yeah, we're Canadians.
[2631.96 --> 2632.34]  Yeah.
[2633.02 --> 2636.42]  I guess we're pretty friendly and we're humble too.
[2636.78 --> 2637.12]  Yes.
[2637.26 --> 2639.80]  We're the most humble out of anyone.
[2639.80 --> 2643.56]  What else do we have?
[2643.66 --> 2643.98]  It's hard.
[2644.76 --> 2645.36]  Okay, so now...
[2645.36 --> 2647.66]  All the news has been about the thing that we can't talk about on YouTube.
[2648.14 --> 2649.04]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2649.12 --> 2654.88]  I had that problem with TechLink today where like we've, you know, we've been reporting,
[2654.88 --> 2663.54]  we've been talking about the health thing that's happening in the world a lot on TechLink.
[2663.54 --> 2665.36]  Actually, I know something.
[2665.56 --> 2667.14]  I want to have a whinge here today.
[2667.14 --> 2668.66]  All right.
[2668.76 --> 2670.58]  So, I was on Dell's website.
[2670.78 --> 2671.30]  Oh, a whinge.
[2671.60 --> 2671.84]  Yes.
[2671.88 --> 2672.38]  Like whining.
[2672.56 --> 2678.60]  Yes, I want to whine at everyone and call out basically every single laptop and desktop
[2678.60 --> 2679.64]  manufacturer.
[2680.42 --> 2681.60]  Fix your websites.
[2681.88 --> 2682.48]  Come on.
[2682.62 --> 2682.86]  Oh.
[2683.26 --> 2690.32]  I was trying to find like what is just like the best bang for the buck gaming laptop recently
[2690.32 --> 2694.58]  and I was trying to just do some research to find out like the one that I picked was
[2694.58 --> 2696.64]  good and it was just impossible.
[2697.14 --> 2699.34]  You just go onto these websites and they all suck.
[2699.44 --> 2702.58]  You go onto like Dell's website and you have to click through like, oh yes, is it for home?
[2702.66 --> 2703.02]  Is it for that?
[2703.08 --> 2703.42]  Like, no.
[2703.52 --> 2707.64]  I just want to be able to be like maybe like Apple's is pretty good but that's just because
[2707.64 --> 2708.66]  they don't have many products.
[2709.22 --> 2713.94]  But so many of them, it's just a huge maze to try and find the product that you're looking
[2713.94 --> 2714.12]  for.
[2714.12 --> 2714.62]  Oh, okay.
[2714.62 --> 2720.48]  Like I know every single product by memory that these companies have and I can't find
[2720.48 --> 2720.76]  them.
[2721.42 --> 2722.28]  Wait, so what do you want?
[2722.32 --> 2723.22]  Just like a big list?
[2723.62 --> 2724.12]  I don't know.
[2724.34 --> 2725.12]  Maybe a big list.
[2725.38 --> 2726.70]  They just need to do better though.
[2726.88 --> 2730.58]  See, alphabetical list doesn't work for people who like, you know, work at a tech YouTube
[2730.58 --> 2734.20]  channel and literally know like every product that has ever happened.
[2734.20 --> 2737.78]  Some of them are sorted by like, what are you trying to do?
[2738.36 --> 2740.92]  And that's much better than everything else.
[2741.00 --> 2745.08]  But I think that the big problem is just like, it's focused on like, what is the lineup
[2745.08 --> 2749.06]  without telling you what this line, like Lenovo is particularly bad.
[2749.16 --> 2749.46]  Let's see.
[2751.86 --> 2752.34]  Lenovo.
[2752.54 --> 2755.44]  The tech news this week is that Alex is an old man.
[2755.62 --> 2755.88]  Yes.
[2755.96 --> 2759.28]  I am mad at all of these laptop manufacturers.
[2759.54 --> 2762.24]  I'm going to try, what is their most recent gaming laptop?
[2762.42 --> 2763.58]  Let's try and figure this one out.
[2763.58 --> 2764.58]  You want me to show your screen?
[2764.58 --> 2765.36]  Can you go on my screen?
[2766.70 --> 2767.86]  Smarter technology for all.
[2767.98 --> 2768.62]  I don't care.
[2768.74 --> 2770.42]  I want to find out what is gaming.
[2770.72 --> 2771.18]  He's upset.
[2771.18 --> 2771.90]  PCs and tablets.
[2772.16 --> 2773.10]  He's upset, everybody.
[2773.28 --> 2774.14]  Laptops right here.
[2774.20 --> 2774.84]  Click on it.
[2774.84 --> 2774.86]  Oh no.
[2775.12 --> 2775.52]  Okay.
[2776.36 --> 2777.42]  Let's see what they got.
[2777.94 --> 2778.16]  Yeah.
[2778.22 --> 2779.20]  What do they have here?
[2779.72 --> 2780.88]  Explore by type.
[2781.90 --> 2783.38]  So for one, it's slow.
[2783.62 --> 2785.02]  There's nothing about gaming here.
[2786.00 --> 2787.00]  And it doesn't.
[2787.36 --> 2788.46]  That's a bit confusing.
[2788.60 --> 2788.86]  Okay.
[2789.02 --> 2789.30]  All right.
[2789.36 --> 2789.56]  All right.
[2789.56 --> 2791.84]  Alex, calm down.
[2791.84 --> 2794.08]  So you're scaring the viewers.
[2794.44 --> 2795.30]  Gaming laptops.
[2795.88 --> 2796.96]  We'll click on this.
[2797.32 --> 2798.16]  It would be really nice.
[2798.30 --> 2801.70]  Like maybe if you could go by type and price point.
[2802.34 --> 2807.84]  Like if you want to look for their budget gaming laptop, you should be able to click on gaming.
[2808.04 --> 2812.88]  And then like, I don't know, consumer and then premium.
[2812.88 --> 2816.22]  Because I'll probably not say like budget in it or whatever.
[2816.36 --> 2818.00]  That's still too many categories for me.
[2818.62 --> 2822.04]  But instead it's like, which one of these do I want?
[2823.32 --> 2824.92]  Oh, you want the Y450.
[2825.18 --> 2825.78]  454.
[2826.30 --> 2828.52]  The Y540.
[2829.34 --> 2829.78]  Obviously.
[2830.14 --> 2831.44]  Oh, it's temporarily unavailable.
[2831.64 --> 2836.08]  I just saw the red thing and I thought that said was like best deal or something.
[2837.06 --> 2841.24]  But like it doesn't tell you what the differences are between like any of these.
[2841.72 --> 2842.30]  Well, what do you mean?
[2842.64 --> 2848.08]  One's got a 15.6 FHD display and another one is a 7.3 inch gaming laptop.
[2848.82 --> 2851.50]  And then you have to like go in and customize them.
[2852.26 --> 2854.36]  It's more difficult than it should be.
[2854.48 --> 2856.22]  Anyway, we should move on.
[2857.24 --> 2858.28]  HP's also bad.
[2858.40 --> 2859.46]  Dell's also bad.
[2860.60 --> 2861.50]  Asus is bad.
[2861.74 --> 2862.76]  Acer's not great.
[2862.76 --> 2865.00]  Do you think this is going to have an impact on the industry?
[2865.30 --> 2865.50]  None.
[2866.32 --> 2868.54]  We have complained about this so many times.
[2868.76 --> 2869.62]  This little rant right now?
[2869.86 --> 2870.08]  Yeah.
[2870.86 --> 2871.54]  I mean, maybe.
[2871.86 --> 2873.60]  Maybe this is the perfect nexus.
[2874.30 --> 2879.94]  Maybe like all the e-tailers are watching us right now and they're like, oh no.
[2880.76 --> 2882.86]  Alex is the guy that reviews the laptops.
[2883.08 --> 2883.74]  No, I think they're going to be.
[2883.74 --> 2884.40]  He's upset.
[2884.74 --> 2887.64]  I think they're going to be like, well, we're not worse than everyone else.
[2887.94 --> 2888.66]  Except for Apple.
[2888.78 --> 2891.02]  And that's probably why people just go in and buy an Apple thing.
[2891.02 --> 2892.98]  Like HP, I don't want to buy a printer.
[2892.98 --> 2894.96]  I'm looking for a laptop right now.
[2895.22 --> 2896.04]  Laptops gaming.
[2896.08 --> 2900.22]  Nick's like, shut up.
[2900.54 --> 2900.90]  What?
[2901.46 --> 2901.80]  No.
[2902.14 --> 2902.78]  Keep it moving.
[2902.98 --> 2903.84]  That's not what I'm saying.
[2904.00 --> 2904.70]  I'm trying, Nick.
[2904.70 --> 2905.68]  We're doing our best, okay?
[2905.74 --> 2906.66]  Linus and Luke are here.
[2906.68 --> 2907.12]  Thank you, HP.
[2907.42 --> 2907.66]  Yeah.
[2908.54 --> 2909.68]  You're doing your turnstest.
[2910.12 --> 2911.34]  We hit a 404.
[2911.86 --> 2912.84]  Oh, nice.
[2913.02 --> 2914.58]  And that's where the train stops.
[2915.26 --> 2916.42]  The pain train.
[2917.34 --> 2918.44]  What are you saying, Nick?
[2918.74 --> 2921.52]  I'm saying, have you heard the good news about LTT Store?
[2921.78 --> 2922.18]  Oh.
[2922.18 --> 2922.52]  What?
[2923.82 --> 2925.14]  It's LTT Store.com.
[2925.14 --> 2926.20]  I sure have.
[2926.20 --> 2927.00]  Oh, it's new, isn't it?
[2927.80 --> 2928.12]  Huh?
[2928.54 --> 2929.40]  It's a new store.
[2929.52 --> 2930.16]  It's a new store?
[2930.28 --> 2930.84]  We need to do layout thing.
[2930.92 --> 2931.42]  It's great.
[2931.68 --> 2932.48]  It's not terrible.
[2932.74 --> 2934.54]  People are going to get mad at us for filling so much.
[2934.54 --> 2936.86]  Find one thing by scrolling past all of the other ones.
[2936.88 --> 2938.06]  You don't have to scroll forever.
[2938.48 --> 2939.02]  Oh, dang.
[2939.04 --> 2941.56]  You don't have to open it up and then see Linus posing in his underwear.
[2942.34 --> 2943.94]  I haven't even seen this yet.
[2944.26 --> 2945.08]  This is a new store.
[2945.26 --> 2945.66]  Whoa.
[2946.18 --> 2946.82]  That looks cool.
[2946.82 --> 2947.08]  It's actually pretty thick.
[2947.82 --> 2948.40]  Heck yeah.
[2948.70 --> 2951.36]  The drive is hard, but the shirt is so soft.
[2952.94 --> 2953.34]  What?
[2954.90 --> 2955.82]  Don't download it.
[2955.82 --> 2956.18]  Wear it.
[2956.26 --> 2956.96]  Oh, because it's RAM.
[2957.10 --> 2957.94]  Downloading more RAM.
[2958.08 --> 2958.26]  Right.
[2958.48 --> 2959.48]  Yes, that's the joke.
[2959.48 --> 2960.10]  I like it.
[2960.18 --> 2961.10]  I like that joke.
[2961.36 --> 2961.70]  Yes.
[2961.92 --> 2962.76]  It made me chuckle.
[2962.90 --> 2963.68]  And free stickers.
[2964.86 --> 2965.26]  Nice.
[2965.40 --> 2966.40]  Hey, this looks great.
[2966.64 --> 2967.44]  Hey, thanks, Riley.
[2967.64 --> 2968.24]  I was waiting.
[2968.34 --> 2970.98]  I was waiting for the site to not look like a mobile site.
[2971.22 --> 2971.58]  Hey.
[2972.04 --> 2972.48]  Hey.
[2972.86 --> 2974.74]  It's your boy, not a mobile site.
[2975.36 --> 2977.16]  Can you buy the hat that I'm wearing right now?
[2977.20 --> 2977.86]  Yes, you can.
[2977.98 --> 2978.62]  There it is.
[2978.78 --> 2979.48]  Hey, look at that.
[2980.52 --> 2981.76]  Can you buy the shirt I'm wearing right now?
[2982.20 --> 2982.78]  This one?
[2982.80 --> 2983.24]  Nope.
[2983.60 --> 2984.00]  No?
[2984.36 --> 2984.64]  Okay.
[2984.64 --> 2985.20]  Never mind.
[2985.26 --> 2987.06]  Don't reveal the audience what you've been...
[2987.06 --> 2989.22]  You can hopefully buy more things soon.
[2989.32 --> 2989.90]  We're trying.
[2990.02 --> 2990.26]  Okay.
[2990.34 --> 2990.62]  Anyways.
[2990.62 --> 2990.96]  We're trying.
[2991.68 --> 2992.08]  Really hard.
[2992.10 --> 2992.72]  Shipping delays.
[2992.92 --> 2993.86]  Please buy our stuff.
[2993.86 --> 2994.58]  Thank you.
[2994.58 --> 2994.78]  Shipping...
[2994.78 --> 3000.10]  I mean, putting anywhere else in the world right now is a little tough.
[3000.94 --> 3001.18]  Yeah.
[3001.82 --> 3004.06]  Moving things from one area of the world to the other.
[3004.18 --> 3004.42]  Yeah.
[3004.66 --> 3006.26]  But we'll get there.
[3006.30 --> 3007.12]  Life is hard.
[3007.86 --> 3008.58]  But LTT...
[3008.58 --> 3009.30]  LTT...
[3009.30 --> 3010.86]  But the shirt is not.
[3014.86 --> 3015.26]  All right.
[3015.26 --> 3016.18]  They actually are very soft.
[3016.28 --> 3016.48]  Okay.
[3016.54 --> 3019.08]  We have another thing to talk about.
[3019.14 --> 3019.50]  I almost forgot.
[3019.70 --> 3022.74]  We're stopping sales with a Wancho shirt this weekend.
[3023.18 --> 3024.38]  Oh, they're stopping sales with a Wancho shirt.
[3024.38 --> 3025.14]  Can I get one of those?
[3025.20 --> 3025.76]  Which one is that?
[3025.80 --> 3026.06]  Yeah, for sure.
[3026.08 --> 3026.46]  Okay, cool.
[3027.00 --> 3028.00]  There's a Wancho shirt.
[3028.12 --> 3029.14]  It says the Wancho on it.
[3029.14 --> 3029.64]  Oh, this one?
[3029.64 --> 3031.16]  The one that says the Wancho.
[3032.56 --> 3033.40]  That's intuitive.
[3034.74 --> 3036.10]  You can buy it until Sunday night.
[3036.34 --> 3036.76]  This one.
[3037.44 --> 3037.76]  Okay.
[3038.20 --> 3038.54]  Bye.
[3038.72 --> 3039.04]  Okay.
[3039.36 --> 3040.12]  See you, Nick.
[3040.54 --> 3042.36]  Get a Wancho shirt, everybody.
[3042.52 --> 3043.10]  Or don't.
[3043.20 --> 3044.12]  That's your prerogative.
[3044.36 --> 3045.06]  But do it.
[3045.70 --> 3047.92]  And that's the final word on that.
[3048.80 --> 3049.30]  Okay.
[3049.64 --> 3050.94]  One more thing to talk about.
[3051.02 --> 3051.34]  Or wait.
[3051.34 --> 3056.92]  Have we covered that two new AMD-specific web browser exploitable things are bad?
[3058.56 --> 3059.86]  Yeah, no, we haven't.
[3060.00 --> 3060.34]  But like...
[3061.48 --> 3063.16]  Jake had it in as the title topic.
[3063.20 --> 3063.60]  He did.
[3063.72 --> 3064.14]  He did.
[3064.68 --> 3065.68]  We'll have to give it to him.
[3065.68 --> 3066.56]  I love that Jake guy.
[3066.58 --> 3068.22]  As the last one, just as an insult.
[3069.26 --> 3070.20]  As the last one?
[3070.92 --> 3071.62]  I guess...
[3071.62 --> 3071.96]  All right.
[3072.12 --> 3073.02]  So the main thing...
[3073.02 --> 3074.22]  Okay, we can read through it.
[3074.38 --> 3075.04]  Let's read through it.
[3075.14 --> 3080.66]  So this week, security researchers from the Graz University of Technology and the University
[3080.66 --> 3086.22]  of Rennes publicly released a paper disclosing two new attack methods designed not for Intel
[3086.22 --> 3091.78]  processors, because Intel processors have had vulnerabilities up the yin-yang these days.
[3091.84 --> 3092.44]  It's crazy.
[3093.56 --> 3100.76]  These are for AMD processors, starting with processors released in 2011 and going up to
[3100.76 --> 3104.94]  now, which includes Zen processors and Zen 2 processors.
[3105.26 --> 3105.86]  That's Ryzen.
[3105.86 --> 3112.36]  So these new exploits target AMD's L1D cache way predictor.
[3112.88 --> 3114.06]  I said that wrong.
[3115.20 --> 3116.64]  L1D cache way predictor.
[3116.72 --> 3118.66]  First introduced with the Bulldozer architecture.
[3119.30 --> 3124.32]  The feature is used an unknown hashing algorithm along with a prediction table to tell which
[3124.32 --> 3129.42]  cache a certain memory address is located in, rather than having to access every cache way.
[3129.60 --> 3130.20]  So here's the thing.
[3130.28 --> 3133.32]  I can read through this whole thing, but I'm not going to fully understand what it means.
[3133.54 --> 3134.72]  Does that mean anything to you?
[3134.72 --> 3135.78]  Not really, no.
[3135.92 --> 3136.32]  Okay.
[3137.72 --> 3141.20]  Maybe if Luke was here, he'd be able to understand what that means.
[3142.24 --> 3142.76]  Yeah.
[3142.88 --> 3147.84]  They're able to break the ASLR, address space layout randomization.
[3148.48 --> 3157.80]  The takeaway from this kind of thing is that AMD has been resurgent in recent years.
[3157.80 --> 3158.02]  Yeah.
[3158.18 --> 3158.42]  Right?
[3158.88 --> 3166.22]  And, you know, Intel's processors have just made less and less sense as AMD makes these
[3166.22 --> 3171.50]  like ballin' Ryzen processors that are excellent at not only multi-threading, but they're also
[3171.50 --> 3173.98]  starting to catch up in single core performance now as well.
[3174.68 --> 3179.50]  And it just hasn't been, you know, Intel's had a hard time catching up to that.
[3179.50 --> 3183.14]  But now, on top of that, they've also had all these vulnerabilities come out.
[3183.70 --> 3186.32]  You know, Meltdown, Spectre, all of those.
[3187.42 --> 3188.32]  What was the other one?
[3188.56 --> 3189.76]  There was a whole group of them.
[3190.10 --> 3190.32]  Yeah.
[3190.48 --> 3191.60]  It's hard to keep track of them all.
[3191.66 --> 3192.00]  Exactly.
[3192.28 --> 3197.42]  And there was just another one last week that LVI, which basically reverses it, like they
[3197.42 --> 3201.26]  mitigated a lot of those patches with performance hits.
[3201.80 --> 3204.56]  They patched the vulnerability, but it comes with a performance hit.
[3205.04 --> 3206.82]  And then, oh wait, was that last week?
[3206.86 --> 3207.56]  No, it was this week.
[3207.98 --> 3209.72]  That just came out on like Tuesday or something.
[3209.92 --> 3210.26]  Was it?
[3210.50 --> 3211.96]  Load value injection, LVI.
[3212.12 --> 3212.30]  Yeah.
[3212.62 --> 3214.06]  Because I reported on it in TechLinked.
[3214.56 --> 3218.64]  And that kind of reversed the way that the speculative execution attacks happen.
[3220.04 --> 3221.64]  And so it was like, ah, geez.
[3221.64 --> 3226.82]  But finally this week we got a vulnerability that also targets AMD.
[3227.04 --> 3230.92]  So it's like, it was getting a little scary.
[3230.92 --> 3240.22]  And this vulnerability that AMD is vulnerable to will also require a patch that will affect
[3240.22 --> 3240.66]  performance.
[3241.56 --> 3246.98]  So it remains to be seen how much it will affect performance.
[3247.70 --> 3249.36]  But we'll have to see.
[3249.64 --> 3254.64]  I just think it's, you know, it had to, the scales had to balance out a little bit here.
[3254.90 --> 3255.10]  Yeah.
[3255.24 --> 3255.50]  You know?
[3256.26 --> 3260.82]  This is, is there anything else important in here that we can actually talk about?
[3261.58 --> 3262.14]  Not really.
[3262.20 --> 3263.12]  Should we just move on to Super Chats?
[3263.62 --> 3265.10]  Let's move on to Super Chats.
[3265.12 --> 3265.32]  Yay.
[3265.58 --> 3266.90]  Because we started on time, right?
[3267.10 --> 3267.58]  Yeah, we did.
[3268.36 --> 3269.90]  There were a bunch of people actually complaining.
[3270.02 --> 3270.96]  They were like, what?
[3271.02 --> 3271.54]  It's on time.
[3271.60 --> 3271.98]  I'm late.
[3272.50 --> 3274.16]  Have they been starting at like 530?
[3274.48 --> 3275.26]  Pretty much, yeah.
[3275.86 --> 3276.82]  We're sorry, guys.
[3277.44 --> 3279.00]  Although it's not, it's not our fault.
[3279.12 --> 3279.30]  Yeah.
[3279.80 --> 3280.96]  We're normally not involved.
[3281.12 --> 3283.04]  Well, sometimes we put the stories in there.
[3283.40 --> 3284.46]  Well, sometimes it's our fault.
[3284.46 --> 3284.74]  Yeah.
[3285.36 --> 3286.38]  Oh, because we keep him.
[3286.72 --> 3286.94]  Yeah.
[3286.94 --> 3287.58]  We keep them from doing stuff.
[3287.58 --> 3288.92]  All of a blog that, you know.
[3289.94 --> 3290.30]  Okay.
[3290.80 --> 3291.24]  Super Ch-
[3291.24 --> 3292.16]  How do you do that?
[3292.58 --> 3293.72]  I actually don't know.
[3293.76 --> 3294.66]  There's only one right now.
[3295.00 --> 3295.74]  There were definitely more.
[3296.68 --> 3298.68]  Theorica gave us 30 bucks.
[3299.06 --> 3299.26]  Wow.
[3299.26 --> 3299.66]  Thanks.
[3300.34 --> 3304.84]  Use this for coffee and what have you for Riley, David, and James for the next Carpel Critics.
[3305.18 --> 3305.38]  Yeah.
[3305.38 --> 3306.90]  Hey, there's a shout out.
[3307.52 --> 3311.48]  Also, John Carpenter's The Thing, Fargo, and Naked Lunch.
[3311.64 --> 3311.88]  Ooh.
[3312.26 --> 3313.04]  Haha, cheers.
[3313.72 --> 3314.28]  Hey, thanks.
[3314.42 --> 3316.34]  Cheers to you too, Theorica.
[3317.14 --> 3317.62]  Theorica.
[3318.24 --> 3320.26]  I will, we'll use that for coffee.
[3320.58 --> 3322.46]  Carpel Critics, that's been fun.
[3323.98 --> 3324.42]  Podcasts.
[3324.50 --> 3326.30]  We're doing, and we're probably going to do more podcasts.
[3326.94 --> 3328.38]  This is a podcast, technically.
[3328.74 --> 3329.98]  Yeah, technically, but not really.
[3330.34 --> 3334.18]  That'll be confusing to people who are listening to it, like, on their podcast app.
[3334.20 --> 3334.94]  They're like, uh, yeah.
[3336.20 --> 3339.98]  But, uh, if you don't know, I'm sure you know, but, like, we've said it many times,
[3340.26 --> 3341.72]  Carpel Critics is a movie podcast.
[3341.96 --> 3343.44]  Me, James, and David host it.
[3343.64 --> 3345.46]  It's available wherever you get your podcasts.
[3345.60 --> 3347.54]  Subscribe on YouTube also, and we're on Flowplane.
[3348.48 --> 3351.40]  And, uh, you might, maybe we'll do a podcast with you sometime.
[3351.88 --> 3352.10]  Sure.
[3352.58 --> 3355.50]  Either you coming on, but you don't, you don't really care about movies.
[3355.52 --> 3356.14]  Yeah, I don't really watch them.
[3356.16 --> 3359.16]  But maybe you'll come on anyways, just to be the devil's advocate.
[3359.46 --> 3362.54]  Maybe we can just review, like, the latest Tech Ingredients video.
[3363.48 --> 3364.22]  Tech Ingredients.
[3364.34 --> 3364.46]  Yeah.
[3364.46 --> 3364.78]  The YouTuber.
[3365.06 --> 3365.24]  Yeah.
[3365.70 --> 3366.04]  Sure.
[3366.04 --> 3367.82]  Just being like, oh, he used indium.
[3368.40 --> 3368.72]  Wow.
[3369.00 --> 3369.60]  Whoa, I never.
[3369.82 --> 3370.72]  He used it to cool a laser.
[3370.94 --> 3374.02]  I never thought I'd see the day where Tech Ingredients uses indium.
[3375.74 --> 3377.20]  How do we look at the other Super Chats?
[3377.22 --> 3377.78]  Well, I thought.
[3378.30 --> 3378.56]  Okay.
[3378.58 --> 3379.38]  There must be a way here.
[3379.88 --> 3382.06]  Am I going to get in trouble for not seeing the rest of them?
[3382.12 --> 3382.98]  Because I saw a bunch of.
[3383.14 --> 3384.18]  Oh, do I have to scroll up?
[3384.22 --> 3385.82]  No, there's no way that you have to scroll up.
[3385.92 --> 3386.24]  Well, yeah.
[3386.38 --> 3386.94]  No, I think you do.
[3388.02 --> 3389.18]  Look, that's how you do it.
[3389.62 --> 3390.28]  I scroll up.
[3390.42 --> 3390.96]  Oh, God.
[3391.42 --> 3392.10]  I scroll up.
[3392.10 --> 3393.64]  I move away from the mic to breathe in.
[3393.74 --> 3394.86]  LTT panties win.
[3397.68 --> 3400.44]  Akihiko says LTT panties win for $2.
[3400.88 --> 3401.40]  Great question.
[3401.48 --> 3401.82]  No clue.
[3402.96 --> 3406.64]  Although, well, I guess maybe they are in the running, because, like, Linus made one for
[3406.64 --> 3407.46]  Yvonne that one time.
[3408.14 --> 3409.62]  Yeah, that was, like, a custom one-off.
[3409.68 --> 3410.22]  That was custom.
[3411.04 --> 3413.80]  I mean, we're being sexist by not having them.
[3414.54 --> 3416.82]  We might as well make them at some point.
[3416.94 --> 3417.84]  I already read that one.
[3417.84 --> 3418.56]  That's there.
[3418.98 --> 3419.42]  Oh.
[3420.12 --> 3420.60]  What?
[3421.48 --> 3422.40]  One just came in.
[3422.52 --> 3422.66]  Oh.
[3423.62 --> 3425.72]  Hey, Brian Ken Alley.
[3426.56 --> 3427.62]  Riley, come on.
[3427.80 --> 3428.26]  Come on.
[3428.46 --> 3429.26]  Like, come on.
[3429.62 --> 3430.16]  Wake up.
[3430.62 --> 3432.02]  Smell the maple nut crunch.
[3433.34 --> 3434.42]  Attached is my resume.
[3434.64 --> 3435.52]  Attached is my resume.
[3435.52 --> 3438.08]  Wait.
[3439.14 --> 3439.62]  What?
[3442.20 --> 3443.24]  I'm confused.
[3443.58 --> 3444.30]  Are we supposed to show these?
[3444.30 --> 3445.42]  Oh, can you click on viewer activity there?
[3446.42 --> 3446.88]  Where?
[3447.28 --> 3450.42]  If you go right to the stream settings, you can go to viewer activity.
[3450.86 --> 3451.80]  Stream settings.
[3452.86 --> 3453.34]  Up.
[3453.78 --> 3454.18]  Yeah.
[3454.24 --> 3454.82]  Viewer activity.
[3455.40 --> 3455.62]  Oh.
[3456.12 --> 3456.76]  Oh, we did it.
[3457.08 --> 3457.50]  Oh, okay.
[3457.50 --> 3457.94]  Here we go.
[3459.18 --> 3459.96]  Okay, we found it.
[3460.00 --> 3461.00]  We found the super chats, guys.
[3461.36 --> 3462.20]  Okay, thank goodness.
[3462.60 --> 3462.84]  All right.
[3462.84 --> 3468.76]  We also got Jordan Abendroth, who for $2 said, Riley, I like your hat and your sweet beard.
[3469.10 --> 3469.56]  Thank you.
[3469.82 --> 3470.94]  The beard is going away.
[3471.22 --> 3474.04]  The hat is available on ltgstore.com.
[3475.12 --> 3477.20]  We already, we're such shills, man.
[3477.24 --> 3477.86]  It's crazy.
[3478.24 --> 3480.88]  Jeremy Young, you missed Akihiko super chat.
[3480.94 --> 3481.42]  No, I didn't.
[3481.48 --> 3482.34]  We just said that.
[3483.50 --> 3484.82]  But thank you for the call out.
[3485.38 --> 3488.62]  Matt Eldridge says, first ever super chat just for Riley and Alex.
[3489.44 --> 3489.86]  Wow.
[3489.86 --> 3490.58]  We made it.
[3491.28 --> 3491.96]  Thanks, Matt.
[3492.48 --> 3494.60]  Sergio Arroyo says, you guys are my faves.
[3494.74 --> 3496.06]  Need more screen on time.
[3496.82 --> 3499.14]  Well, that's not fair to Luke and Linus, though.
[3499.16 --> 3499.64]  I don't want to.
[3500.08 --> 3500.38]  Yeah.
[3500.68 --> 3501.10]  Thank you.
[3501.12 --> 3501.54]  This is their moment.
[3502.14 --> 3503.08]  This is when they get to talk.
[3503.16 --> 3506.82]  Manal Sina for $25 says, Riley, tech link is flipping awesome.
[3506.92 --> 3507.88]  Love all your content, dude.
[3507.98 --> 3508.74]  Alex is too.
[3509.12 --> 3513.26]  By the way, Alex, would you take that Vio laptop with all them ports you unboxed on Short
[3513.26 --> 3516.12]  Circuit if it had the Surface slash Dell trackpad?
[3517.02 --> 3518.20]  That's a good question.
[3518.38 --> 3519.22]  Although not, no.
[3519.22 --> 3521.00]  Because I didn't watch that short circuit.
[3521.00 --> 3526.06]  It doesn't have a 16 by 10 display or 3 by 10 or 3 by 2 display.
[3526.16 --> 3527.20]  But the ports, Alex.
[3527.46 --> 3528.48]  It also doesn't have a touchscreen.
[3529.10 --> 3530.38]  It also is floppy.
[3530.52 --> 3531.48]  It's a real floppy one.
[3531.84 --> 3532.94]  Let me tell you.
[3533.10 --> 3535.46]  I'll use a laptop and I'll be like, this is pretty cool.
[3535.60 --> 3538.80]  You know, this is like a work of somebody worked hard on this.
[3539.08 --> 3541.86]  And you'll be like, the arrow key is weird.
[3542.64 --> 3543.28]  It doesn't have a touchscreen.
[3544.74 --> 3544.92]  Yeah.
[3544.92 --> 3545.20]  I'll go.
[3545.54 --> 3546.24]  I'm Alex.
[3547.20 --> 3547.56]  Yeah.
[3547.70 --> 3550.62]  You're like, oh, it's cool because it doesn't have Intel.
[3550.74 --> 3551.86]  It's an ARM processor.
[3552.44 --> 3554.42]  It's really overpriced and floppy.
[3554.58 --> 3558.14]  But when I say that, I don't mean that like I want to use it as my personal laptop.
[3558.14 --> 3560.90]  I just mean that I want to play around with it because it's kind of interesting.
[3561.34 --> 3561.52]  Yeah.
[3561.52 --> 3561.66]  Yeah.
[3562.14 --> 3562.40]  Yeah.
[3562.44 --> 3566.74]  I just like that stupid, you're always on about the Google not touching thing.
[3566.82 --> 3567.24]  Oh, man.
[3567.30 --> 3567.66]  There's so many.
[3567.66 --> 3568.56]  And the ARM processors.
[3569.10 --> 3569.44]  Yeah.
[3569.92 --> 3570.98]  Well, it's the future.
[3571.18 --> 3571.44]  Maybe.
[3571.60 --> 3572.12]  I don't know.
[3572.64 --> 3575.92]  Matt Eldridge says for two pounds.
[3576.12 --> 3576.70]  First ever super.
[3576.74 --> 3577.02]  Oh, no.
[3577.04 --> 3577.72]  I already did that one.
[3577.82 --> 3578.12]  Dang it.
[3578.30 --> 3580.12]  Daniel Merritt says you guys are so Canadian.
[3580.18 --> 3580.56]  It's awesome.
[3580.68 --> 3581.16]  That is all.
[3581.34 --> 3581.90]  Love you, Daniel.
[3582.82 --> 3583.94]  Do I have to go through all of these?
[3584.64 --> 3586.52]  I just don't think we'll have time to do all of it.
[3587.14 --> 3587.60]  I love you all.
[3587.60 --> 3589.62]  Do we just go for the larger numbers?
[3589.62 --> 3591.76]  Oh, maybe.
[3592.06 --> 3592.70]  Is that what we did?
[3592.70 --> 3594.60]  For 150, whatever the heck those were.
[3594.74 --> 3596.08]  Well, this is 100 rupees.
[3596.62 --> 3597.86]  I don't know what that is in Canadian.
[3599.38 --> 3600.70]  This is going to come in chunks.
[3600.82 --> 3601.34]  Stay tuned.
[3601.52 --> 3603.42]  We need you guys to figure out what is worth the money.
[3603.68 --> 3607.12]  I don't understand, but hey, love you.
[3609.84 --> 3611.58]  I don't know if that's a lot of money or not.
[3612.68 --> 3613.38]  This other one.
[3613.42 --> 3615.98]  Oh, I see you guys got the new, or what is this?
[3616.32 --> 3617.02]  Mega Gaffey.
[3617.02 --> 3619.50]  I see you guys got the new DGA goggles in.
[3620.32 --> 3622.56]  Did you guys try them out, and how do you like them?
[3622.74 --> 3623.04]  Ooh.
[3623.60 --> 3626.46]  There's a video coming on those that is hilarious.
[3626.76 --> 3630.22]  Yeah, so we can't really answer that question in depth right now, but stay tuned.
[3630.22 --> 3637.76]  But it involves Dennis wearing a camera on his face and being blindfolded.
[3639.36 --> 3642.10]  Garfish says, Pixel 2 gang, rise up.
[3642.36 --> 3643.46]  Replace that battery, dude.
[3643.58 --> 3643.84]  Woo!
[3644.50 --> 3645.10]  Pixel 2.
[3645.26 --> 3646.08]  Rock on, dude.
[3646.08 --> 3651.98]  I have a cough and fever.
[3652.26 --> 3654.54]  Then don't go around people and wash your hands.
[3657.96 --> 3660.02]  Suspicious Mallard says, hey, from Belfast.
[3660.26 --> 3661.28]  From Belfast!
[3661.70 --> 3663.54]  I probably shouldn't do an Irish accent, right?
[3663.64 --> 3665.98]  That's not cute.
[3666.72 --> 3667.06]  Hope.
[3667.34 --> 3669.64]  Home from darts, but a huge fan of the show.
[3669.72 --> 3670.76]  By the way, it's like 12 a.m.
[3670.76 --> 3671.24]  Cool.
[3672.58 --> 3673.00]  Nice, dude.
[3673.08 --> 3674.08]  Are darts a big thing over there?
[3674.42 --> 3675.56]  I think that I saw, like...
[3675.56 --> 3677.82]  He got home from darts, maybe he was doing it at the pub, you know?
[3678.62 --> 3678.86]  Yeah.
[3679.02 --> 3679.40]  Is that wrong?
[3679.60 --> 3680.78]  Look, I'm Irish, all right?
[3680.78 --> 3681.44]  I'm half Irish.
[3681.44 --> 3684.30]  I can say that.
[3686.46 --> 3687.94]  Can you give us an update on Shadow?
[3688.02 --> 3690.76]  That was one of the topics we were going to talk about, but, you know, we don't really
[3690.76 --> 3693.50]  have time now, but Shadow basically added...
[3693.50 --> 3695.10]  Shadow, the streaming service.
[3695.46 --> 3697.12]  Oh, I think that they're talking about a different Shadow.
[3698.06 --> 3698.54]  What Shadow?
[3698.94 --> 3699.56]  The cat.
[3701.46 --> 3701.82]  Oh.
[3702.62 --> 3702.98]  Jeez.
[3704.50 --> 3704.82]  Whoopsies.
[3705.12 --> 3706.60]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[3706.60 --> 3708.40]  We weren't really going to talk about that because...
[3708.40 --> 3710.12]  Yeah, Linus can talk about that later.
[3710.12 --> 3710.76]  Yeah, Linus can talk about it.
[3711.46 --> 3718.64]  But Shadow, the game streaming service, has a new tier, $12 a month, and that will hopefully
[3718.64 --> 3721.64]  help it compete with Stadia and GeForce Now and stuff.
[3721.88 --> 3723.46]  And apparently it's getting VR.
[3724.44 --> 3724.82]  Is it?
[3724.98 --> 3726.74]  Yeah, that seems like a really good way to puke.
[3726.78 --> 3727.18]  Oh, dang, dude.
[3727.82 --> 3732.14]  They also still have, like, their $50 a month tier where you can, like, rent a Titan X or
[3732.14 --> 3733.58]  something online, so that's pretty crazy.
[3733.64 --> 3734.60]  That one's actually pretty fun.
[3734.88 --> 3737.30]  Please mention the upcoming folding event, Ben Quigley.
[3737.38 --> 3738.00]  Yes, we did.
[3739.36 --> 3740.20]  What else we got?
[3740.20 --> 3744.58]  Karate Kid 002 build a cheap AoE gaming PC for a video?
[3745.10 --> 3745.50]  AoE?
[3745.72 --> 3746.54]  Age of Empires?
[3747.62 --> 3752.86]  What graphics card would be good with a Xeon X3330 CPU?
[3753.16 --> 3753.86]  Great question.
[3754.22 --> 3754.80]  Jeez, Louise.
[3754.80 --> 3758.92]  I don't know.
[3759.00 --> 3759.76]  I don't know, man.
[3759.90 --> 3760.32]  Okay, wait.
[3760.36 --> 3761.30]  Are there more that came in?
[3763.00 --> 3763.86]  Yes, there are.
[3764.04 --> 3765.34]  Oh, there's a Minecraft server.
[3765.72 --> 3767.52]  Langley pressure washing, of all people.
[3768.52 --> 3769.16]  Said that.
[3769.16 --> 3770.40]  MC.
[3770.40 --> 3770.44]  MC.
[3770.44 --> 3771.64]  MC.LTD.GG.
[3771.86 --> 3773.00]  LTD Minecraft server.
[3773.16 --> 3775.70]  If you play Minecraft, go play on the Minecraft server, I guess.
[3775.78 --> 3776.58]  Jake's been working on it a lot.
[3776.58 --> 3777.40]  Jake's been working on it.
[3777.40 --> 3778.08]  Way too much.
[3778.22 --> 3779.50]  For a long time.
[3780.12 --> 3783.58]  At work today, I saw him build a pit and then put a bunch of chickens in it.
[3783.68 --> 3787.58]  I don't know what his plan was, but it didn't seem very humane.
[3787.72 --> 3788.68]  Play on our Minecraft server.
[3788.68 --> 3789.78]  There's lots of chickens.
[3790.40 --> 3791.28]  It's awesome.
[3791.70 --> 3794.86]  I think that they were actually testing, like, how many chickens you can get because they
[3794.86 --> 3796.40]  were having problems with it not being enough.
[3797.82 --> 3803.94]  Ross Vlogs says, for two pounds, says, say thanks to all the SC in a Scottish accent.
[3804.46 --> 3804.80]  SC.
[3805.22 --> 3805.66]  Super chats.
[3807.34 --> 3808.86]  Thanks to all the...
[3808.86 --> 3809.88]  No, it's not bad.
[3810.02 --> 3810.64]  It's bad, guys.
[3810.66 --> 3811.18]  No, do it.
[3811.32 --> 3811.56]  Do it.
[3811.58 --> 3814.22]  That's not really something you can say in a Scottish accent.
[3814.86 --> 3815.52]  Say thanks.
[3816.26 --> 3818.16]  Thanks all you super chats.
[3818.84 --> 3819.62]  That wasn't bad.
[3819.94 --> 3820.14]  Yeah.
[3820.26 --> 3821.22]  On that note, should we call it?
[3821.46 --> 3822.44]  I think that's about it.
[3822.56 --> 3822.74]  Yeah.
[3824.10 --> 3824.58]  All right.
[3824.62 --> 3825.40]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[3825.48 --> 3827.76]  Thanks for putting up with the people who aren't Linus and Luke.
[3828.38 --> 3828.60]  Yeah.
[3829.36 --> 3832.44]  And they'll be back next week, or one of them will be at the very least.
[3832.98 --> 3833.34]  Hopefully.
[3833.46 --> 3834.02]  We'll have to see.
[3834.56 --> 3835.02]  All right.
[3835.32 --> 3836.26]  Love you so much.
[3836.46 --> 3836.68]  Yeah.
[3837.04 --> 3837.62]  Hit the bell.
[3837.70 --> 3839.04]  Oh, there's an outro, right?
[3839.14 --> 3839.50]  Hit subscribe.
[3839.92 --> 3840.54]  Oh, yeah, subscribe.
[3840.54 --> 3842.12]  No, it's the intro, but again.
[3842.36 --> 3843.38]  You just hit the intro again?
[3843.40 --> 3843.58]  Yeah.
[3845.90 --> 3847.80]  You can tell we're amateurs here.
[3848.34 --> 3848.66]  Boom.
[3848.68 --> 3849.08]  All right.
[3849.12 --> 3849.82]  Love you so much.
[3850.90 --> 3852.12]  Wait, it does this again?
[3852.68 --> 3852.92]  No.
[3853.24 --> 3854.24]  Oh, we did it wrong.
[3854.86 --> 3855.22]  Oh, no.
[3855.90 --> 3857.88]  Oh, there it is.
[3858.96 --> 3859.36]  Yeah.
[3859.90 --> 3860.18]  Hey.
[3861.42 --> 3861.90]  Thanks for wanting.
[3861.90 --> 3862.30]  I love you.
[3863.04 --> 3864.08]  We're not supposed to talk to you.
[3865.04 --> 3865.68]  But we can.
[3865.94 --> 3867.12]  Why don't you want to do that?
[3868.08 --> 3870.04]  Because then you get like sounds over sounds.
[3870.28 --> 3872.02]  You kind of have a hard time hearing sounds.
[3872.02 --> 3877.28]  Oh, and then I.
[3877.40 --> 3878.20]  Oh, here we go.
[3879.88 --> 3881.38]  Wait, does it do it by itself?
[3882.58 --> 3884.26]  Did you not have to move all of those?
[3884.58 --> 3885.32]  Savage jerky.
[3885.38 --> 3885.68]  Love you.
[3885.80 --> 3886.00]  Wait.
[3886.00 --> 3886.16]  What?
[3886.20 --> 3886.30]  Okay.
[3886.42 --> 3886.86]  Wait.
[3886.86 --> 3887.22]  Wait.
[3887.22 --> 3887.58]  Bye.
[3887.58 --> 3888.58]  I'll see you next time.
[3888.58 --> 3888.96]  Bye.
[3889.04 --> 3889.16]  Bye.
[3889.40 --> 3890.04]  Bye.
[3890.28 --> 3890.48]  Bye.
[3890.66 --> 3890.70]  Bye.
[3890.70 --> 3891.42]  Bye.
[3892.20 --> 3892.76]  Bye.
[3892.76 --> 3892.84]  Bye.
[3892.88 --> 3902.76]  Bye.
[3902.76 --> 3903.34]  Bye.
[3903.44 --> 3903.58]  Bye.
[3903.66 --> 3903.86]  Bye.
