[0.00 → 1.52] Unless we team up with Yvonne and Chase.
[2.20 → 4.94] Hey, welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[5.08 → 7.84] We've got a fantastic show for you all today.
[7.96 → 12.46] A lot of big topics, including, of course, third time's the charm.
[12.62 → 19.80] AMD announced their Ry zen 5000 series of processors that looks absolutely well.
[19.94 → 23.36] To put it simply, freaking incredible.
[24.06 → 28.40] Like, if half of what they said is true and accurate,
[28.40 → 31.54] this is going to be an absolute game changer.
[32.04 → 36.80] Also, we've got some drama in the data recovery space.
[37.38 → 41.48] So, we did, recently, we did a sponsored video with Drive Savers,
[41.92 → 46.52] where one of the things that we talked about was a recent fix for the iPhone
[46.52 → 49.12] that Drive Savers says they figured out.
[49.24 → 52.60] And then we've actually got some other folks in the data recovery
[52.60 → 54.38] and device repair community that are saying,
[54.58 → 57.16] actually, that wasn't them.
[57.16 → 58.48] So, we're going to get into that.
[58.62 → 59.28] What else we got?
[59.98 → 60.98] Very interesting, very interesting.
[61.08 → 64.22] There's a PS5 teardown that's been getting meted a little bit,
[64.36 → 66.28] but it's still very interesting.
[66.36 → 67.06] What do you mean meted?
[67.06 → 67.64] It's awesome.
[68.70 → 69.98] It has been meted a little bit.
[70.06 → 70.34] Really?
[70.46 → 70.96] By Xbox.
[71.38 → 71.56] Yeah.
[71.74 → 72.48] Oh, whatever.
[73.26 → 74.82] I don't necessarily agree with the miming,
[74.96 → 76.88] but we'll get into it either way.
[77.18 → 79.00] Starlink is entering the public beta soon.
[79.00 → 83.16] And I thought I had something else that was cool that I wanted to bring up.
[83.56 → 84.56] Oh, the MSI drama.
[84.80 → 85.10] Yeah.
[85.26 → 85.86] More drama.
[86.10 → 89.50] It's going to be a drama, drama llama show today.
[89.62 → 89.72] Yeah.
[89.74 → 90.24] I'm excited.
[90.44 → 90.82] I'm excited.
[90.90 → 91.44] It's going to be fun.
[91.44 → 121.42] It's going to be fun.
[122.24 → 123.20] Oh, man.
[123.46 → 124.04] It's broken.
[124.30 → 125.34] Add Squarespace.
[126.74 → 127.00] Woo.
[127.68 → 128.08] Hold on.
[128.12 → 129.04] I got to fix this.
[129.36 → 130.32] There we go.
[130.62 → 130.98] Line salute.
[133.38 → 137.10] Oh, when you're your own producer on a live show, it's the best.
[137.58 → 137.90] Someday.
[138.00 → 140.04] Someday, maybe I'll hire a producer.
[140.24 → 140.64] Just kidding.
[141.08 → 141.52] All right.
[141.52 → 144.44] This was posted by William CLL on the forum,
[145.04 → 148.78] and AMD's Where Gaming Begins event was kind of a big deal.
[148.86 → 150.26] Luke, have you looked at this yet?
[152.14 → 152.64] That's fine.
[152.78 → 153.24] That's fine.
[153.30 → 154.22] I'm going to walk you through it.
[154.28 → 155.08] It's huge.
[155.66 → 159.94] So AMD is taking such a big leap forward here that they are just,
[160.10 → 162.54] they're just skipping 4,000 series.
[162.72 → 164.10] They're just skipping it on the desktop.
[164.10 → 167.00] They're going straight from Ry zen 3,000 to Ry zen 5,000.
[167.00 → 169.32] And actually, I think the reason they're doing that is more to do with that.
[169.58 → 174.50] They mucked up the branding on the notebook side, calling Zen 2 Ry zen 4,000.
[174.68 → 177.04] So then it's like, oh boy, now what are we going to do?
[177.08 → 182.42] Are we going to have like this 1,000 disparity between laptop and desktop forever?
[182.60 → 183.10] No, we're not.
[183.14 → 184.66] We're just going to make everything 5,000.
[184.80 → 185.36] Love it.
[185.90 → 186.88] This has happened a few times.
[186.92 → 189.20] That happened with the 800 series on NVIDIA's side.
[189.34 → 189.84] Yeah, so dumb.
[189.84 → 199.74] Anyway, so where gaming begins, they announced the Ry zen 9 5950X, 5900X, 5800X, and 5600X.
[199.86 → 203.38] Those are 16, 12, 8, and 6 core processors respectively,
[203.74 → 209.46] with anywhere from 35 megabytes of cache all the way up to 72 megabytes of cache,
[209.76 → 214.22] and boost clocks from 4.6 all the way up to 4.9 gigahertz.
[214.22 → 221.02] That's right, ladies and gentlemen, AMD is getting dangerously close to the 5 gigahertz barrier.
[222.02 → 226.24] Impressively, they are not only running at these high clock speeds,
[226.38 → 229.92] but they are doing it within the same TDP as their predecessors.
[230.14 → 236.04] So they're all rated for 105 watts down to the 8 core and 65 watts for the 6 core.
[236.22 → 236.88] Like, dang.
[237.40 → 240.76] Like, looking at the single-threaded performance that they're claiming on these things,
[240.76 → 245.10] like, one of those six cores and, like, a nice small form factor machine,
[245.32 → 247.14] it's like 65 watts?
[247.54 → 248.40] That's incredible.
[248.84 → 249.88] It's exciting, you know?
[250.24 → 252.74] Puts the excitement back in CPUs again.
[253.38 → 258.08] And the bigger deal, of course, is not the clock speeds or the cores.
[258.24 → 260.94] I mean, AMD has already been a leader when it comes to core count.
[261.30 → 266.08] The bigger deal is the improvement in per-clock efficiency,
[266.08 → 271.08] so how much performance they can actually get out of each clock cycle.
[271.24 → 278.40] And they are apparently claiming a 19% lift in instructions per clock.
[279.38 → 279.86] Wild.
[280.20 → 281.02] Like, two generations.
[281.38 → 282.56] That is massive.
[282.68 → 283.32] Well, it depends.
[283.48 → 284.96] I mean, are we talking Intel generations?
[285.14 → 286.96] Because then it's like four.
[287.74 → 288.94] It's like four, Luke.
[289.34 → 289.66] Okay?
[289.94 → 291.86] Which generations are we looking at here?
[292.44 → 294.16] Star Trek generations?
[294.16 → 297.80] Because then it's probably a little less.
[298.02 → 298.34] It's probably...
[298.34 → 300.82] I think the technology moves a little faster in Star Trek
[300.82 → 301.98] than it does over at Team Blue.
[303.10 → 306.82] AMD is claiming that these new CPUs are going to beat Intel,
[307.06 → 308.32] sometimes by a lot,
[308.52 → 311.12] in not only productivity, where they've already been strong,
[311.30 → 312.62] but also gaming.
[313.36 → 314.64] That's the big winner, in my opinion.
[315.04 → 318.38] AMD is claiming they're going to be 20% faster than Intel
[318.38 → 320.36] in Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
[320.36 → 323.52] Because one of the crazy things is they already won over gamers
[323.52 → 325.80] by just being, like, better overall.
[326.86 → 330.48] Like, a lot of gamers were sacrificing the performance difference in games.
[330.58 → 330.76] Yeah.
[330.84 → 331.86] And just being like, whatever.
[332.08 → 333.42] I might end up streaming.
[333.54 → 335.04] I might end up doing something else,
[335.06 → 336.56] which is going to take more of the processor as a whole.
[336.72 → 338.36] I'll go for the AMD option.
[338.64 → 340.76] And now that it's better in both categories,
[340.76 → 342.46] it's like...
[342.46 → 343.92] Oh, man.
[343.92 → 348.74] So, as of the launch of the 5000 series,
[348.94 → 351.60] assuming that all of this is correct,
[352.14 → 355.48] AMD will hold the following advantages over Intel.
[356.14 → 357.58] Multi-threaded performance.
[360.76 → 361.98] Bang for the buck.
[363.16 → 364.24] Cheaper motherboards.
[365.84 → 367.94] Potentially single-threaded performance.
[367.94 → 372.74] And the CSGO benchmark specifically
[372.74 → 374.68] has been something that's been hanging over their head
[374.68 → 375.64] for a really long time.
[375.80 → 376.76] Storage performance.
[377.08 → 378.26] PCI Express Gen 4,
[378.36 → 381.72] which all of a sudden is being thrown into the limelight.
[382.20 → 384.16] Like, here we've got Sony and Microsoft
[384.16 → 385.76] launching these new consoles,
[385.94 → 387.46] and they're saying next-generation games
[387.46 → 389.68] are going to really take advantage of high-speed storage.
[390.94 → 391.38] And...
[391.38 → 392.32] Sup, yo!
[392.96 → 394.06] How are you doing?
[394.06 → 397.98] What's hanging?
[398.12 → 399.44] I don't know why he decided to come hang out,
[399.56 → 400.30] but he did.
[400.46 → 402.28] I heard you weren't feeling good last night.
[403.16 → 404.64] Yeah, he's been sick,
[405.02 → 406.82] but he seems to be doing a little bit better.
[407.30 → 408.16] He always gets excited...
[408.16 → 408.82] Oh, there we go.
[409.22 → 410.96] He always gets excited when I talk a lot.
[411.14 → 413.36] He likes, like, loud conversation,
[413.36 → 415.38] so he seems to love Sancho every day.
[415.68 → 416.08] Sweet, dude.
[416.08 → 417.54] So, like, get a little bit more animated,
[417.68 → 418.30] and he's like, yeah!
[418.48 → 418.88] Yeah!
[419.16 → 419.84] Rock on!
[420.38 → 421.84] Yeah, shake your tail, baby!
[422.44 → 422.82] All right.
[422.82 → 424.72] So, right.
[424.90 → 426.90] So, high-speed SSDs are all of a sudden
[426.90 → 428.40] becoming a major factor,
[428.56 → 430.58] a big consideration for future games,
[430.70 → 432.50] and, hey, cold hard truth is
[432.50 → 435.20] not everybody is, you know, me,
[435.36 → 437.70] and is upgrading their hardware every cycle, right?
[438.02 → 439.08] For most people,
[439.16 → 440.54] I think it's pretty fair to say
[440.54 → 442.94] that anywhere from three to eight years
[442.94 → 444.62] is as long as you could expect
[444.62 → 445.78] to be using a gaming rig,
[445.80 → 446.82] and you might make a couple...
[446.82 → 447.00] Yeah.
[447.08 → 448.80] ...a couple key upgrades in that time.
[448.90 → 450.08] Oh, I need a bit more storage
[450.08 → 452.00] because the new Modern Warfare
[452.00 → 453.96] is 600 terabytes.
[453.96 → 454.68] ...a hard drive.
[454.78 → 455.42] Yeah, exactly.
[455.88 → 457.72] Okay, so you need some more storage.
[458.14 → 459.72] You know, NVIDIA Soffit
[459.72 → 462.06] to grant us a new graphics card,
[462.14 → 462.90] finally, you know,
[462.94 → 464.08] maybe upgrade to one of those.
[464.38 → 465.10] That sort of thing.
[465.22 → 467.00] But in terms of the core platform,
[467.22 → 468.70] you expect to be able to use it
[468.70 → 469.84] for quite some time.
[469.84 → 474.14] And so if I was buying a system today,
[474.30 → 476.62] PCI Express Gen 4 went from,
[476.98 → 477.44] eh, whatever,
[477.92 → 480.68] to, wow, that is a major consideration
[480.68 → 482.02] if I want my gaming rig
[482.02 → 484.84] to be able to play these next-gen console games
[484.84 → 486.74] that aren't going to stay console-exclusive forever.
[487.06 → 489.16] Speaking of the longevity of the platform,
[489.56 → 490.86] advantage number six
[490.86 → 493.04] is intergenerational compatibility.
[493.36 → 496.88] Now, AMD did kind of tick off the community
[496.88 → 499.94] based on what they had initially promised
[499.94 → 503.68] when they went back on 300 series motherboards
[503.68 → 507.50] having support for this upcoming generation of processors.
[507.90 → 509.20] If I recall correctly,
[509.26 → 511.16] I can't remember exactly which generation
[511.16 → 513.08] AMD was, like, not going to support
[513.08 → 513.88] and then people were mad.
[514.28 → 515.18] Maybe it was B450?
[515.78 → 516.90] Okay, doesn't matter.
[517.00 → 517.64] The point is,
[517.72 → 520.16] AMD did let folks down a little bit,
[520.22 → 521.42] but then if I recall correctly,
[521.52 → 523.04] again, they ended up making it right
[523.04 → 526.30] and they are still definitely holding an advantage
[526.30 → 527.78] over Intel in this regard.
[527.88 → 529.88] Intel has been real strict
[529.88 → 531.76] for, like, pretty much the last 10 years.
[532.20 → 533.86] Okay, you get a chipset
[533.86 → 537.02] and then the chipset that launches with that CPU,
[537.54 → 539.76] that chipset might get one more CPU
[539.76 → 541.60] and then that's it.
[542.14 → 544.02] It's been pretty much on that cadence
[544.02 → 545.90] and even if the socket doesn't change,
[546.18 → 547.84] and in some cases, I do understand
[547.84 → 551.06] there were actual engineering considerations
[551.06 → 552.92] that made it so that they didn't want to just say,
[552.92 → 554.86] okay, it's a free-for-all,
[555.10 → 557.64] sure, put Coffee Lake on this, do that.
[557.84 → 559.04] I get it, I get it.
[559.82 → 561.66] But that doesn't change that
[561.66 → 563.28] from a competitive standpoint,
[563.52 → 564.32] they're behind AMD,
[564.48 → 567.66] who has had as much as three generations of CPUs
[567.66 → 570.44] now be available on a single motherboard.
[570.64 → 571.56] That's crazy,
[571.96 → 574.18] and it looks like that's going to continue.
[574.40 → 577.20] So the 500 series boards that are out there now
[577.20 → 579.94] are not only going to be compatible with Verizon 5000,
[579.94 → 582.08] they're supposed to be drop-in compatible.
[582.26 → 584.02] AMD has apparently been stealthily
[584.02 → 585.72] putting in the microcode
[585.72 → 587.54] that's needed for these upcoming processors,
[588.40 → 590.12] and so if you've updated your BIOS
[590.12 → 590.92] in the last little bit,
[591.02 → 592.02] it is quite possible
[592.02 → 595.34] that you will just chuck a 5000 series CPU in there.
[595.40 → 596.70] Don't chuck it, please put it in nicely.
[597.44 → 598.54] And you're ready to rock.
[599.70 → 601.16] Can we think of any more advantages?
[601.34 → 602.50] Did I already say cheaper motherboards?
[603.38 → 603.94] You did.
[604.02 → 604.52] I think I did.
[604.60 → 605.40] Okay, number six.
[605.48 → 607.32] I mean, let's brainstorm here, ladies and gentlemen.
[607.44 → 608.08] What else we got?
[608.16 → 608.58] What else we got?
[608.62 → 609.68] Let's head over to the float plane chat.
[609.68 → 609.98] By the way,
[610.00 → 611.76] if you're not subscribed to LTT on float plane,
[611.80 → 612.52] you got to get over there
[612.52 → 614.62] because we got early access.
[614.88 → 616.10] We got behind the scenes.
[616.66 → 618.34] Now is genuinely the best time
[618.34 → 620.62] to subscribe to LTT float plane
[620.62 → 622.24] that I think there's ever been
[622.24 → 625.20] because you guys are pumping the exclusives.
[625.48 → 626.74] Yeah, Ed's been doing a great job.
[626.94 → 629.08] He's even just did weird test footage
[629.08 → 629.96] and stuff like that.
[630.06 → 631.14] He's been chucking it on there.
[631.70 → 635.22] The're taking things slow video was so cool.
[635.80 → 636.84] There's no audio.
[637.16 → 637.92] There's no intro.
[638.42 → 639.28] There's just nothing.
[639.28 → 640.64] It's just slo-mo footage
[640.64 → 642.46] randomly stitched together in a row.
[642.72 → 644.08] I was like, this is great.
[644.40 → 645.62] We just got a high-speed camera.
[646.32 → 648.74] So we finally, yeah, we've rented them before,
[648.84 → 650.64] but we finally actually own one.
[651.18 → 651.78] What did you get?
[652.04 → 654.78] We got, oh, bloody hell, what's it called?
[656.58 → 658.48] Kronos high-speed camera.
[659.42 → 660.50] What's their new one called?
[660.58 → 664.70] The Kronos 2.1 HD from Fronted.
[665.26 → 666.86] We did a tour of their facility
[666.86 → 668.68] like way back a thousand years ago.
[668.68 → 669.68] They're still around.
[670.42 → 672.24] So Kronos 2.1.
[672.46 → 673.28] Yeah, yeah.
[673.36 → 674.50] So it's only like five grand,
[674.66 → 676.46] but it does, I think,
[676.62 → 680.18] either 720 or 1080 at a thousand frames per second.
[680.64 → 682.74] And a thousand frames per second is sort of the
[682.86 → 684.78] yeah, 1080 at a thousand frames per second.
[684.78 → 686.82] So that's sort of the magic number for us
[686.82 → 690.24] because when it comes to evaluating things like monitors,
[690.86 → 695.80] a thousand frames per second is one millisecond per frame.
[696.18 → 698.84] So if we wanted to do something like investigate
[698.84 → 701.86] the gray-to-gray response times
[701.86 → 705.82] of the pixels of a monitor or something like that,
[705.84 → 707.52] it's just really easily divisible.
[707.78 → 711.52] So we used it actually today in a really cool video.
[711.52 → 714.88] I was really annoyed with LG for not getting us
[714.88 → 718.66] their new C10 48-inch, well, months ago
[718.66 → 721.24] because we've been asking for it for months.
[721.68 → 724.02] And so we couldn't even get a sample to review.
[724.36 → 726.82] And then meanwhile, there's like sponsored videos
[726.82 → 728.62] with other people going up about it.
[728.64 → 729.64] And I'm like, for real,
[730.06 → 732.64] you guys can't find one TV to send us
[732.64 → 735.40] where we just want to make editorial content
[735.40 → 737.14] because we're really excited about it.
[737.22 → 738.48] And you got to send it to people
[738.48 → 739.76] who needed to be paid to make the video.
[739.82 → 740.86] What are you guys even doing?
[740.86 → 744.36] Like at what point do I just have to apply for a job there
[744.36 → 746.24] so I can show you guys all how this is done?
[746.52 → 748.08] Like for crying out loud.
[750.38 → 752.76] Honestly, hey, you know, I applied at Amazon, right?
[753.22 → 754.18] Like way back in the day.
[755.20 → 756.80] I'll remind me to tell that story later.
[756.84 → 757.86] I'll tell that story later anyway.
[759.52 → 763.10] So anyway, we used it today for our C10 video
[763.10 → 766.82] and it was so cool because we were able to use the
[766.82 → 769.46] we were able to use the high-speed camera.
[769.46 → 771.52] So instead of doing a pursuit setup,
[772.12 → 773.92] we actually just had a stationary camera
[773.92 → 775.26] while the UFOs went across
[775.26 → 777.88] and it's running at such a high frame rate
[777.88 → 781.02] that we can actually just see the pixels changing.
[781.52 → 784.14] So OLED, one of the great things about that technology
[784.14 → 786.92] is how quickly the pixels shift
[786.92 → 789.34] compared to something like an IPS LCD,
[789.50 → 790.74] even a very high-speed one.
[791.00 → 794.18] So we whipped out a 360 hertz gaming monitor
[794.18 → 797.32] and then we had our OLED running at 120 hertz
[797.32 → 798.94] and we tried them at-
[798.94 → 799.86] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[799.96 → 800.18] Okay.
[800.44 → 802.24] So we tried them at various refresh rates,
[802.36 → 804.20] 60 and 60, 120 and 120,
[804.52 → 808.06] and then 120 versus 240 and 120 versus 360
[808.06 → 812.92] to see at what point does refreshing the LCD faster
[812.92 → 816.78] overcome the slower pixel response times?
[816.78 → 820.14] Because even on a one millisecond LCD panel,
[820.80 → 822.38] come on, get real.
[822.70 → 823.42] It's not even close.
[823.58 → 824.70] And we can see that.
[824.76 → 826.18] We can see that on the high-speed camera.
[826.30 → 827.74] So it's pretty exciting.
[828.10 → 829.84] I'm jazzed to show you guys that video.
[829.94 → 831.86] That'll definitely be early access on Float plane.
[832.04 → 833.18] So coming around full circle,
[833.26 → 834.36] make sure you're subscribed to Float plane.
[834.82 → 835.84] That's the camera we got
[835.84 → 837.04] that I just showed you guys, by the way.
[837.12 → 837.86] It's pretty sick.
[837.94 → 839.16] Those guys are a local company.
[839.42 → 841.20] So feel free to check them out.
[841.32 → 842.92] Don't expect to get a camera anytime soon.
[843.02 → 845.04] They've had some serious supply chain issues
[845.04 → 845.60] due to COVID.
[845.74 → 848.02] That's one of the reasons it took us so long to get it
[848.02 → 849.78] because ever since we did this collabs
[849.78 → 851.10] with GAV from Slo-Mo Guys
[851.10 → 855.14] and with Shroud, Mr. Grams, Corey, and Paul
[855.14 → 857.88] for the like, does high refresh rate gaming
[857.88 → 859.12] help your abilities?
[859.40 → 860.88] We've been trying to get our hands on one
[860.88 → 861.74] and I just didn't want to,
[861.80 → 864.18] I just didn't want to deal with A, the cost
[864.18 → 865.90] and B, the hassle of Phantom.
[866.64 → 868.56] Like, it is not easy to work with.
[868.62 → 870.54] I do not envy GAV.
[870.64 → 871.86] He's very successful.
[871.86 → 875.28] He's basically, like, a real celebrity at this point.
[876.08 → 877.18] You know, him and Dan.
[877.32 → 880.94] And I'm just like, yep, got no desire for your life
[880.94 → 882.26] because that looks horrible.
[882.64 → 884.92] Just dealing with that slo-mo footage all the time.
[885.10 → 886.84] And they do so much of the work themselves.
[888.36 → 891.70] So back to AMD and all the various advantages
[891.70 → 892.26] that they have.
[892.30 → 893.98] I never actually ended up looking at the chat.
[893.98 → 897.10] My one quick thing before I go forward
[897.10 → 899.90] is one of my favourite things about Flow plane
[899.90 → 901.96] is, like, the comment section on this slo-mo video.
[902.26 → 905.56] It's like I said, it's just no audio, no intro, no outro,
[905.74 → 907.54] just random stitched-together slo-mo footage.
[907.70 → 907.90] Yeah.
[908.20 → 910.08] All the comments are like, this is great.
[910.74 → 911.46] I know.
[911.64 → 913.38] The Flow plane community is so positive.
[914.08 → 915.18] They're so nice.
[915.56 → 916.12] Here, okay, here.
[916.48 → 918.06] I'll tease a little bit of it.
[918.64 → 921.02] So this is just Ed playing around with the slo-mo camera.
[921.12 → 923.84] The image quality is actually not bad.
[924.74 → 925.30] Like...
[925.30 → 926.74] It looks perfect.
[927.00 → 929.48] Yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
[929.48 → 931.82] This is exactly what we needed.
[931.92 → 933.88] So you can expect to see more of this kind of stuff
[933.88 → 934.74] in upcoming videos.
[936.32 → 938.64] I'm surprised Dennis didn't, like, scare himself.
[939.36 → 940.86] Actually, look on his face.
[940.90 → 941.54] He probably did.
[941.98 → 942.56] What a nerd.
[942.98 → 943.66] I love that guy.
[944.60 → 946.80] I wonder how many FPS this is at.
[947.38 → 949.74] We can actually turn down the resolution
[949.74 → 953.30] and get even greater frame rates if we really want to.
[953.30 → 955.46] So I think it can...
[955.46 → 959.40] We did some at 3,000 FPS earlier today.
[961.34 → 963.32] Why does he have a plastic gun?
[963.52 → 964.88] What even am I looking at?
[966.54 → 966.90] Okay.
[968.54 → 968.94] Jeez.
[969.78 → 971.30] Sorry, I haven't actually seen this.
[971.36 → 974.66] I don't even, like, review some of the things that they upload.
[974.82 → 975.90] Look at the look on his face.
[975.96 → 977.04] Like, it's a balloon, Dennis.
[977.04 → 979.72] Just chill, dude.
[983.12 → 984.24] That's pretty fun, though.
[984.66 → 985.28] It's cool.
[985.62 → 985.84] Yeah.
[986.16 → 986.54] All right.
[986.62 → 989.52] I love how Rod is, like, in the comments
[989.52 → 992.26] criticizing the like, a bit versus drill usage.
[993.06 → 994.34] Oh, come on, Rod.
[994.34 → 995.28] Just chill.
[998.54 → 999.28] That's great.
[999.48 → 1000.08] I love it.
[1000.58 → 1001.06] All right.
[1001.80 → 1003.76] What else are we looking at?
[1003.76 → 1005.82] Okay, so back to AMD.
[1006.88 → 1008.16] So advantages for Intel.
[1008.50 → 1010.56] Why don't we change gears and talk about their advantages?
[1011.28 → 1015.50] Intel teased their upcoming Rocket Lake 11th Gen processors.
[1015.94 → 1018.76] It is rumoured to be a 14 nanometre variant
[1018.76 → 1020.38] of the new Willow Cove architecture,
[1020.56 → 1021.86] which Tiger Lake is based on.
[1022.16 → 1024.50] So we could be getting faster onboard video.
[1028.60 → 1029.12] Cool.
[1030.84 → 1031.36] Nice.
[1031.92 → 1032.40] Nice.
[1032.40 → 1034.18] Good win, guys.
[1034.34 → 1034.70] Nice.
[1035.44 → 1035.88] Nice.
[1036.52 → 1038.12] I mean, we also might get, like,
[1038.18 → 1041.74] RDNA 2 onboard video from AMD and upcoming Apus.
[1041.96 → 1043.50] So, like, but still.
[1043.90 → 1044.24] Nice.
[1044.36 → 1044.76] Nice.
[1044.98 → 1045.26] Nice.
[1046.20 → 1046.78] I am.
[1046.80 → 1047.94] Someone made a comment earlier,
[1048.10 → 1050.36] and it sucks that the Rocket Lake thing's coming
[1050.36 → 1053.30] because they were calling it Coffin Lake in Twitch chat.
[1053.52 → 1054.60] And I thought that was pretty great.
[1055.04 → 1055.18] Okay.
[1055.18 → 1056.10] When I was talking earlier,
[1056.10 → 1057.52] I was talking about Coffee Lake,
[1057.68 → 1058.56] not Coffin Lake.
[1058.56 → 1058.66] I know.
[1058.74 → 1059.06] I know.
[1059.20 → 1059.38] I know.
[1059.50 → 1060.20] Coffin Lake.
[1060.20 → 1061.40] I just thought it was cool.
[1061.40 → 1063.68] Oh, what a creepy place to hang out on a weekend that would be.
[1064.76 → 1067.12] Honestly, though, I like Desperate Intel.
[1067.74 → 1071.90] I like Against the Ropes Intel a lot better than I like Complacent Intel
[1071.90 → 1075.00] because that's what it takes to get through to the suits.
[1075.42 → 1077.20] And if that's what it takes, fine.
[1077.36 → 1080.04] Because every other time Intel's been up against the ropes,
[1080.18 → 1082.40] they have come back swinging hard.
[1082.40 → 1087.26] So has Intel had all their good brains drained away?
[1087.58 → 1088.22] I don't know.
[1088.38 → 1089.58] We're going to find out soon enough
[1089.58 → 1092.44] because I'm sure they're going to need a way to come back
[1092.44 → 1094.66] and make a splash here sometime in the next.
[1095.06 → 1096.90] I mean, the thing about it, guys, is that like,
[1097.82 → 1100.40] oh, man, there are so many things for them to overcome.
[1100.58 → 1104.82] Oh, advantage number seven is AMD's approach to CPU design
[1104.82 → 1107.72] with their chaplets allows them apparently
[1107.72 → 1109.86] to be much more efficient about product development
[1109.86 → 1113.14] and work on multiple different cores in parallel
[1113.14 → 1117.34] to the point where apparently they were able to just drop
[1117.34 → 1120.52] these new Zen 3 cores onto the same substrate
[1120.52 → 1122.78] that they were using for Ry zen 3000 series
[1122.78 → 1126.72] with the same IO die and just like, okay, here we go.
[1127.16 → 1128.36] Like, that's incredible.
[1128.50 → 1130.12] Obviously, it wasn't quite that simple.
[1130.50 → 1134.12] Like, there's a lot of engineering that goes into getting something
[1134.12 → 1135.28] like that working just right.
[1136.32 → 1137.66] Actually, advantage Intel.
[1137.66 → 1140.88] I really hope that AMD does a better job
[1140.88 → 1142.84] with virtualization this time around.
[1143.30 → 1145.30] It was, and can be done.
[1145.82 → 1146.36] I know.
[1146.48 → 1146.78] I know.
[1146.90 → 1148.90] I saw all the comments on the couple's PC
[1148.90 → 1150.76] where people were like, oh, Wendell did it.
[1151.42 → 1154.22] The fact that Wendell did it does not mean
[1154.22 → 1155.52] that it is user-friendly.
[1156.04 → 1156.16] Okay.
[1156.26 → 1157.84] Wendell can do amazing things.
[1157.94 → 1159.54] Wendell could do just about anything.
[1160.10 → 1161.54] Yeah, as far as I can tell.
[1161.54 → 1166.24] Wendell, as far as I can tell, single-handedly created
[1166.24 → 1168.44] the DisplayPort KVM market.
[1168.92 → 1170.58] Did you know he collects?
[1171.90 → 1174.72] And I don't think this was a joke.
[1174.84 → 1176.00] I think this was serious.
[1177.28 → 1182.64] He collects the tops of like toilet bucket things.
[1182.64 → 1185.32] Like my dad's going to kill me.
[1185.40 → 1185.86] Like the shelf?
[1185.86 → 1186.02] Like the reservoir?
[1186.42 → 1186.68] Yeah.
[1187.38 → 1187.82] Yeah.
[1187.82 → 1190.82] Like the shelf to put your sandwich and your milk on, right?
[1191.46 → 1192.60] Your sandwich and your milk?
[1192.64 → 1192.76] Yeah.
[1192.76 → 1193.82] When you're snacking on the can.
[1195.18 → 1195.52] Yeah.
[1195.80 → 1196.12] Sure.
[1196.60 → 1196.90] Yeah.
[1197.70 → 1198.10] Yeah.
[1198.36 → 1199.26] He collects those.
[1199.42 → 1200.16] He collects them.
[1200.94 → 1201.20] Yeah.
[1201.78 → 1202.82] Where does he keep them?
[1203.70 → 1203.90] Yeah.
[1203.90 → 1205.22] Let me try to find this really quick.
[1205.26 → 1206.46] That's the weirdest thing.
[1206.54 → 1210.04] I love Wendell, but like, dude, what the f***?
[1210.44 → 1211.08] Like, what are you?
[1211.58 → 1211.98] What?
[1213.02 → 1214.24] Let me try to find it.
[1214.46 → 1216.74] I mean, are they like vintage or like?
[1218.76 → 1219.98] What are we talking about here?
[1220.04 → 1225.12] He like had some actually kind of cool ones, which was fascinating.
[1225.52 → 1226.58] Let me see if I can find it.
[1226.58 → 1228.40] When I first saw it, I was like, oh, that's a joke.
[1228.46 → 1230.52] And then I clicked on the thread, and I was like, oh, wow.
[1230.68 → 1231.40] Some of these are actually.
[1231.54 → 1231.70] Okay.
[1231.78 → 1232.36] I found it.
[1232.88 → 1233.20] Okay.
[1233.20 → 1237.14] If you discord it to me, I can bring it up and screen share it.
[1237.30 → 1238.48] This is some like weird.
[1238.68 → 1239.00] Like what am I?
[1239.00 → 1241.82] By the way, Level One Text is on Flow plane and they're killing it.
[1241.88 → 1242.46] They're awesome there.
[1242.54 → 1243.10] Go check them out.
[1243.20 → 1243.38] Yeah.
[1243.54 → 1243.72] Go subscribe.
[1243.84 → 1244.22] Hooray, hooray.
[1245.16 → 1245.48] Wow.
[1246.12 → 1246.48] Okay.
[1247.10 → 1249.12] This is apparently real.
[1250.00 → 1250.32] Okay.
[1250.98 → 1253.02] The time has come for me to let go of a few things.
[1253.10 → 1254.76] The basement has got too much crap in it.
[1254.76 → 1256.02] Is that an intentional pun?
[1256.40 → 1260.30] But where does one go to unload their lovingly curated toilet lid collection?
[1260.30 → 1263.30] Is the internet ready to know about this?
[1263.44 → 1265.26] Are you like what?
[1265.86 → 1272.96] And like, that's way too many to just be random, you know?
[1273.60 → 1276.88] Like, Sep what?
[1277.54 → 1278.48] Sep 28.
[1278.64 → 1279.44] 1974.
[1280.10 → 1280.38] Okay.
[1280.88 → 1286.32] That's like, that's like old enough to be old, but like not old enough to be vintage.
[1287.14 → 1287.68] Isn't it?
[1287.68 → 1289.96] I mean, how long ago was 1974, I guess?
[1290.90 → 1292.74] He's got, he's got ones from the fifties.
[1293.50 → 1293.88] Uh-huh.
[1294.00 → 1297.04] I've got one that was minted July 21st, 1969.
[1297.38 → 1298.98] So is this like, is it about the dates?
[1300.78 → 1302.00] There's a market for these.
[1302.06 → 1302.94] He says eBay.
[1304.12 → 1305.84] Toilet tank lid store.com.
[1305.90 → 1306.96] You've got to be $69.
[1307.24 → 1308.72] No, this is clearly a joke.
[1309.26 → 1311.06] The fact that it's priced at $69.
[1311.50 → 1312.64] I refuse to accept it.
[1312.70 → 1314.36] I refuse to accept that this is real.
[1315.00 → 1315.96] No, no.
[1315.96 → 1324.98] If Wendell, if Wendell wants to call me right now and, and explain himself, then maybe I will believe it because I trust, I trust Wendell.
[1325.38 → 1326.12] I do too.
[1326.20 → 1329.92] Which is why, like when he tweets this, I have to take it at face value.
[1330.14 → 1330.76] No, no.
[1330.76 → 1332.54] He's also, he's also a member though.
[1332.54 → 1336.00] That's the problem with Wendell is he's a straight-faced member.
[1336.52 → 1338.22] So you can't trust him.
[1339.06 → 1340.38] But I also trust him.
[1340.54 → 1340.64] Yeah.
[1340.74 → 1341.40] I trust him too.
[1341.54 → 1342.16] I trust him too.
[1342.80 → 1346.22] We're talking about Wendell from level one texts and his toilet lid collection.
[1347.04 → 1348.16] It's weird.
[1348.16 → 1353.84] I mean, whatever you want to, yeah.
[1353.94 → 1355.76] Whatever you want to do, whatever gets you going.
[1356.02 → 1356.26] Yeah.
[1357.12 → 1368.56] So in other news, AMD provided a sneak peek at their Radeon RX 6000 series, now codename Big Nazi, with numbers that seemingly put it in line with the RTX 3080.
[1368.56 → 1373.06] And if that's true, AMD might be competitive on all fronts this coming generation.
[1373.26 → 1377.72] Tell me something, Luke, would you build an all red gaming machine?
[1381.44 → 1383.74] Uh-oh, that's a long hesitation.
[1384.72 → 1385.24] Sure.
[1385.44 → 1386.48] Do you bleed green?
[1386.66 → 1387.70] Do you bleed green, Luke?
[1388.56 → 1392.76] I have been very hard on NVIDIA in the past.
[1393.06 → 1397.78] I have made a number of videos when I used to make videos that were very hard on NVIDIA in the past.
[1397.78 → 1402.24] But it was easy because the red team basically didn't exist at that point in time.
[1403.74 → 1407.20] So if they like to exist properly, absolutely.
[1407.88 → 1408.06] Yeah.
[1408.68 → 1410.88] On the processor side, I think there's no question.
[1411.24 → 1411.36] Yeah.
[1411.84 → 1414.08] So, but there's a chance you'd go brown?
[1416.38 → 1416.90] Yes.
[1417.22 → 1417.42] Yeah.
[1417.52 → 1417.78] Okay.
[1418.20 → 1418.44] Yeah.
[1419.06 → 1419.92] Go brown.
[1420.58 → 1421.48] Green and red.
[1422.72 → 1423.60] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1423.62 → 1424.46] The brown PC.
[1424.58 → 1425.90] We should totally make that a video.
[1425.90 → 1428.34] The brown PC go all Noctua and everything.
[1429.60 → 1430.70] That'd be kind of cool.
[1430.82 → 1430.92] Yeah.
[1431.00 → 1432.64] Well, I mean, remember the chocolate computer?
[1433.40 → 1433.58] Yeah.
[1433.98 → 1435.24] That colour scheme was sick.
[1435.24 → 1436.88] That graphics card was sweet.
[1437.26 → 1437.86] It was sick.
[1437.98 → 1439.52] It actually looked so cool.
[1439.74 → 1441.04] Worked out so well.
[1442.74 → 1443.10] All right.
[1443.34 → 1446.24] So team PGP is streaming.
[1446.82 → 1448.40] And that's like Wendell and the gang.
[1448.40 → 1453.50] And people have gone over there and are talking to him about their toilet covers.
[1454.84 → 1456.30] Oh, is he live right now?
[1456.78 → 1458.18] Yeah, he's live right now.
[1458.72 → 1459.46] Oh, man.
[1459.64 → 1460.10] All right.
[1460.24 → 1460.58] Okay.
[1460.62 → 1461.76] Well, I was hoping he would.
[1461.98 → 1462.76] Wait, I don't see him.
[1462.78 → 1463.56] Oh, is he live on Twitch?
[1464.50 → 1464.86] Yes.
[1465.02 → 1465.64] Oh, okay.
[1465.64 → 1467.22] I just assumed he'd be live on YouTube.
[1467.34 → 1470.38] Maybe we'll like rate him afterward and razz him about his toilet collection.
[1471.04 → 1471.32] All right.
[1471.78 → 1478.72] Why don't we move on to the Drive Savers versus iPad Rehab Information War is apparently what
[1478.72 → 1479.48] this was called.
[1479.56 → 1480.42] It must have been James.
[1480.42 → 1483.38] If they're still going, we should play Left 4 Dead with them afterward.
[1483.58 → 1484.06] Heck yeah.
[1484.36 → 1485.00] I'm super down.
[1485.00 → 1487.46] So Lewis Grossman made a video.
[1488.26 → 1492.20] Jessa from, shoot, what's her thing called again?
[1492.98 → 1493.98] iPad Rehab.
[1494.40 → 1502.40] Jessa from iPad Rehab made a video about saving iPhones that were stuck on the Apple logo after
[1502.40 → 1503.82] the iOS 13 update.
[1505.06 → 1512.36] And basically, I think the video I have linked here is Lewis's video talking about how our
[1512.36 → 1518.82] video, which was sponsored by Drive Savers, had Drive Savers apparently taking credit for
[1518.82 → 1525.34] this fix, which involved like shorting some speaker IC or something like that, and then
[1525.34 → 1530.18] booting it, and then pulling the data off, then resetting it, then unsporting it, and
[1530.18 → 1532.44] then the phone would just like work normally.
[1533.14 → 1534.46] So we have been accused.
[1534.68 → 1534.88] Kind of wild.
[1535.00 → 1535.20] Whoops.
[1535.52 → 1536.36] Oh my.
[1536.36 → 1542.44] So we have been accused of amplifying alleged misinformation from Drive Savers related to
[1542.44 → 1545.80] who exactly it is that discovered the fix.
[1546.58 → 1552.24] And Drive Savers, so, okay, so this appears to be like copied from one of the forum threads
[1552.24 → 1556.26] or one of the YouTube comments or something, but the allegation is that Drive Savers paid
[1556.26 → 1561.70] Linus to say that they had discovered the fix, and this is a fact that is contested.
[1561.70 → 1568.74] So on December 19th, 2019, Jessa from iPad Rehab streams her solution, removing deactivating
[1568.74 → 1569.64] speaker amp chip.
[1569.88 → 1573.38] She does mention in the video that she's been talking to several larger companies about this
[1573.38 → 1573.72] problem.
[1574.26 → 1577.34] She claims she learned of the fix a few days prior to the stream.
[1578.14 → 1581.80] The place to look for a hardware solution, this is a quote, the place to look for a hardware
[1581.80 → 1587.22] solution to a software problem is not our ideas, definitely not unintelligible RO our own.
[1587.60 → 1591.36] The credit goes to the collaborative culture of the hardworking men and women in the global
[1591.36 → 1594.90] independent repair micro soldering community and a few really tenacious board repair guys
[1594.90 → 1600.32] who are willing to freely share their hard-earned information, and she credits Raj Paul in Australia
[1600.32 → 1600.88] for one.
[1601.32 → 1606.50] And this is actually something that has been my experience in the data recovery and device
[1606.50 → 1607.44] repair industry.
[1607.68 → 1609.86] It's incredibly tight-knit.
[1610.10 → 1611.94] Like, yes, everyone's competing.
[1612.28 → 1616.30] There's only so many devices that are broken and need to be fixed, I guess.
[1616.80 → 1620.90] With that said, I mean, I think that the industry could be probably five times the size,
[1620.90 → 1624.98] and it would be better for the world if people were getting their devices repaired instead
[1624.98 → 1630.06] of just giving them back to Apple so that they can be recycled or which, by the way, it
[1630.06 → 1633.38] is not like that's recycling sounds perfect.
[1634.00 → 1635.00] It's not that good.
[1635.12 → 1637.20] It's a lot better for the device to just keep working.
[1637.20 → 1638.20] Yes.
[1638.38 → 1641.84] And this was absolutely my experience with Deep Spar, for example.
[1641.98 → 1643.96] We've worked with them on sponsored videos in the past.
[1644.04 → 1645.44] Those guys are so cool.
[1646.22 → 1655.86] Like, they're like basically exactly the kind of like Russian data guys that you would expect.
[1656.72 → 1659.50] Like, one of the guys there, like literally is...
[1659.50 → 1661.08] I don't know if I'm allowed to say this.
[1661.48 → 1661.76] Whatever.
[1661.88 → 1662.44] I'm going for it.
[1662.44 → 1663.86] He's literally in a fight club.
[1664.34 → 1665.84] And I was like, what?
[1667.24 → 1669.60] Because he's like covered in scars and stuff.
[1669.64 → 1672.48] And I'm like, so what's up with that?
[1672.90 → 1676.18] And like, he's like kind of like, he's low-key jacked.
[1676.34 → 1677.02] You know what I mean?
[1677.34 → 1683.40] Like, not like, oh yeah, this is all for show and like I pose and stuff.
[1683.52 → 1688.96] But like, could definitely knock your head off if he hit you hard enough.
[1688.96 → 1691.46] And so I was like, yeah, I mean, we're chill, right?
[1691.74 → 1693.86] What's up with all the like scars and stuff?
[1694.16 → 1695.90] And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, I like fight.
[1696.16 → 1697.68] And I'm like, oh yeah, I like boxing.
[1697.78 → 1698.56] He's like, nah.
[1699.50 → 1702.66] I'm like, he's like, yeah, yeah, you just like you go, and you like fight.
[1702.72 → 1704.88] And I'm like, is this fight club?
[1705.02 → 1706.26] And he's like, yeah, basically.
[1706.44 → 1706.90] I'm like, what?
[1706.90 → 1714.42] Anyway, so the Deep Spar guys are like some of the coolest techies I've ever met.
[1714.72 → 1719.60] And they're like, are exactly how you would imagine the kinds of people whose job it is,
[1719.60 → 1726.12] is to break the protections or even sometimes just lack of documentation and information
[1726.12 → 1729.62] from drive manufacturers in order to help people get their data back.
[1729.62 → 1738.04] And from talking to them, everything that I know about this community is just super collaborative
[1738.04 → 1746.20] because the cold hard truth is that between the unwillingness or inability of drive manufacturers
[1746.20 → 1752.20] to provide spare parts and information on repairing and recovering these devices,
[1752.54 → 1756.08] it takes a community in order to make this happen.
[1756.08 → 1763.76] So it seems like Jess's message overall here sounds about right to me that this is a collaborative thing.
[1764.78 → 1770.50] So she claims she called Drive Savers and On Track to let them know about the fix for the benefit of consumers
[1770.50 → 1773.18] since these companies are recommended by Apple.
[1773.78 → 1781.30] On October 1st, 2020, Linus amplifies this message from Drive Savers that said that they found the fix.
[1781.80 → 1785.32] And then on October 8th, Louis Grossman uploaded a video shining light
[1785.32 → 1789.60] on sort of this disagreement between Drive Savers and Jessa.
[1790.04 → 1793.52] So in response to us asking Drive Savers about it, they say,
[1794.06 → 1794.28] quote,
[1794.40 → 1798.60] We do not share solutions and timeframes when we make advancements in data recovery.
[1799.00 → 1802.78] So for her to refute our claims has no basis.
[1803.56 → 1804.12] Fair enough.
[1804.90 → 1808.16] Drive Savers claims they already had the fix prior to speaking to Jessa,
[1808.32 → 1811.92] and they support this using a screenshot taken two days before her stream.
[1811.92 → 1813.68] Paraphrasing.
[1813.82 → 1814.46] I'm paraphrasing here.
[1814.52 → 1817.28] They say basically, hey, this problem can be solved just so you know.
[1817.32 → 1818.14] And she says, yep, I know.
[1818.20 → 1818.50] Thanks.
[1820.38 → 1825.90] So at this point, I have not spoken to Jessa.
[1826.12 → 1827.40] I haven't spoken to Louis.
[1828.04 → 1831.46] All I've been able to do is go through what they're saying,
[1832.04 → 1833.96] ask Drive Savers for their take on it.
[1833.96 → 1838.52] They were, I want to thank them for even talking about this at all.
[1838.76 → 1842.62] They were a little reluctant to kind of get into this kind of thing.
[1842.70 → 1848.56] They were like, yeah, look, we don't really engage in this kind of like he said, she said.
[1849.16 → 1852.14] We've been doing this a very, very, very long time.
[1852.14 → 1858.14] And if, you know, at the end of the day, we feel like our reputation stands for itself.
[1858.24 → 1868.30] So we don't like to get into this kind of like, you know, who found it first sort of hearsay.
[1869.28 → 1870.52] And I get that.
[1870.66 → 1871.94] I totally understand that.
[1872.00 → 1880.22] I mean, we've gone through similar things in the past where we've been accused of things by much, much smaller YouTubers, for example, that weren't true.
[1880.22 → 1886.22] And unless they really like blew up in the community, our approach has always been to just ignore them.
[1886.44 → 1892.32] Because the reality of it is when we are, when we have 10 times, it's driving me crazy.
[1892.52 → 1898.44] When we have 10 times as many subscribers as someone else, our mere acknowledgement of their presence,
[1899.08 → 1903.86] even if we're calling them a liar, is a net positive gain in exposure for them.
[1903.96 → 1909.80] And so my general philosophy, anytime someone has wronged me, has been ignored them to death.
[1910.84 → 1913.68] Now, Drive Savers didn't say any of that.
[1914.00 → 1916.92] That's all just my approach to these kinds of disagreements.
[1917.06 → 1921.16] But I do know that they had a reluctance to get in here and talk about this at all.
[1921.28 → 1923.56] But I want to thank them for sharing their side of the story.
[1923.96 → 1929.88] I'm not in a position to verify because Drive Savers doesn't talk about this stuff publicly.
[1929.94 → 1933.24] I'm not in a position to verify who exactly came up with the fix.
[1933.24 → 1938.46] But I do want to say, you know, hey, I'm glad that the solution was found.
[1938.90 → 1940.96] I'm glad that people were able to get their data back.
[1941.18 → 1945.04] I really admire the collaborative nature of the data recovery community.
[1945.62 → 1948.78] And at the end of the day, I don't think Jess is the bad guy here.
[1948.92 → 1950.64] I don't think Louis is the bad guy.
[1950.78 → 1952.76] I don't think Drive Savers is the bad guy.
[1952.84 → 1956.06] I haven't seen any evidence that any of them are a bad guy here.
[1956.06 → 1960.50] I think at the end of the day, all of them from my interactions with Louis,
[1960.78 → 1962.36] from my interactions with Drive Savers.
[1962.60 → 1963.78] And like I said, I don't know Jess.
[1963.78 → 1964.86] I've never spoken to her.
[1965.20 → 1968.92] But everything that I know about her reputation tells me that these are all people
[1968.92 → 1973.84] that really do just want individuals and businesses to get their valuable data back.
[1973.98 → 1978.40] So I just don't want any more drama around this.
[1979.40 → 1980.64] I have not seen...
[1980.64 → 1982.56] Drive Savers has not led me wrong in the past.
[1982.96 → 1984.70] So I tend to trust them.
[1984.70 → 1987.82] But maybe there was just a misunderstanding here.
[1987.90 → 1991.70] I mean, this could be as simple as the whole calculus invention thing.
[1992.10 → 1995.58] I mean, calculus is sort of famous for being invented by two people.
[1995.74 → 1997.38] Or you could call it a discovery.
[1997.58 → 1998.88] I mean, math is its inherent.
[1999.08 → 1999.88] So you kind of Discover it.
[1999.88 → 2001.90] There are a few things like that too.
[2002.22 → 2002.82] It's not just...
[2002.82 → 2004.18] The calculus one is very interesting.
[2004.40 → 2008.94] But there are quite a few things where like in completely different parts of the world
[2008.94 → 2011.56] and without like internet style communication,
[2011.88 → 2013.48] things were discovered simultaneously.
[2013.48 → 2016.16] It's a thing.
[2016.26 → 2016.76] It happens.
[2018.76 → 2023.20] I don't know if this is true because I can't hear.
[2024.32 → 2027.84] But as far as I can tell from looking at the Team PGP chat,
[2027.92 → 2031.06] I think you need to check your Twitter because he's wondering what your phone number is.
[2031.16 → 2031.56] I think.
[2031.56 → 2033.00] Wendell doesn't have my phone number?
[2033.48 → 2033.92] Since what?
[2034.28 → 2034.80] I don't...
[2034.80 → 2035.56] I'm not sure.
[2035.74 → 2036.30] I don't know.
[2036.64 → 2036.96] Maybe.
[2038.52 → 2040.34] Someone said he needs to...
[2040.34 → 2042.58] Linus just has to check Twitter for a phone number.
[2042.90 → 2043.56] Someone said that.
[2044.20 → 2046.80] So I don't know if that's like legit or not.
[2046.96 → 2047.22] Okay.
[2047.28 → 2047.86] One moment, please.
[2047.86 → 2050.12] I can't hear what Wendell's saying.
[2050.46 → 2051.22] One moment, please.
[2051.30 → 2053.98] We got to place a little call to Kentucky.
[2054.38 → 2055.92] I'm going to say, do you have his phone number?
[2056.00 → 2056.82] You can solve it that way.
[2056.84 → 2058.22] We got to place a little call to Kentucky.
[2058.22 → 2071.64] Make sure you don't show your screen.
[2071.76 → 2072.60] Is he trolling me?
[2073.36 → 2076.22] Please leave a message for 859...
[2076.22 → 2080.62] It's gone.
[2081.66 → 2082.16] Okay.
[2082.44 → 2083.24] Hold on a second.
[2083.52 → 2085.22] I just called Dog.

[2159.04 → 2164.88] because I want to talk to you about this toilet seat collection or not seat toilet cover
[2164.88 → 2171.12] collection yeah there's over a hundred yeah I understand that I can tell that from the picture
[2171.12 → 2176.08] that's not really the question is not how many you have the question is why
[2178.08 → 2182.56] so it turns out that's the thing that plumbers do i kind of sort of inherited the collection
[2182.56 → 2190.24] in a manner of speaking and uh this was your dad a plumber comes from well no, no not exactly okay
[2190.24 → 2197.44] uh, uh it just sort of uh it just sort of worked out that way so yeah there's a there's quite a
[2197.44 → 2204.40] collection of toilet lids from like 1909 all the way up through like 1997. So like 90 years of toilet
[2204.40 → 2210.00] lids it's really just completely insane okay can I just for just as a point of clarification here um
[2210.00 → 2215.84] what is the point of this like do you try to do you try to get like really cool manufacturing dates
[2215.84 → 2222.56] like this toilet lid was made on the day that you know uh Linus tech tips uh you tried Linux for the
[2222.56 → 2229.36] first time like what's the significance yeah there are a couple of those in their like that which
[2229.36 → 2236.32] is completely insane but is that by chance yeah that's just completely by chance um it's just it's
[2236.32 → 2242.08] just a fun thing you notice when you're cataloguing them so even more insane there are websites dedicated
[2242.08 → 2248.88] to uh tank lid like somebody like chips their lid, and it's like oh man I need something that matches
[2248.88 → 2255.04] my vintage 1979 you know uh olive green toilet where am I going to get a replacement lid there's
[2255.04 → 2260.40] three or four websites that are like hey replacement toiletlid.com, and they have a far more impressive
[2260.40 → 2265.84] collection than I do this is one of those things like mattress underground where I like I look at it and I go
[2265.84 → 2271.04] wow who like who dedicates their life to you know making sure that people understand the difference
[2271.04 → 2278.64] between you know like uh like organic latex and like regular latex and what mattresses are made of
[2278.64 → 2286.88] and whatever like really yeah yeah it's its one of those rabbit holes that it's like okay someone has
[2286.88 → 2292.00] put a lot of time into curating this collection because where else are you going to find you know like
[2292.00 → 2297.36] the olive green like the olive drab you know toilet tank lid or like that certain shade of blue from
[2297.36 → 2303.12] like 1978 but if you have a toilet like that, and you chip the lid, and you're not going to replace the
[2303.12 → 2308.24] entire toilet where else you're going to go yeah I mean this is just the kind of problem that i never um
[2308.24 → 2313.28] that yeah i just never imagined myself having therefore I never imagined what the solution would need to be
[2313.28 → 2322.24] so um I know for a fact that you're a businessman, and you also run a YouTube channel and I'm sort of
[2322.24 → 2328.80] wondering if it's the best use of your time to catalogue toilet lids can you could you respond to that
[2330.00 → 2335.52] it's an it's a little there's a there's a therapeutic component to it maybe so you know okay I don't know
[2335.52 → 2342.96] uh it's an it's a certain there's a certain quiet dignity to i can't even say it with a straight
[2342.96 → 2349.44] face there's a quiet dignity to uh you know it's like oh wow this is this certain brand that's from
[2349.44 → 2353.52] Italy, and you know nobody's ever heard of them before and most of them are you know American
[2353.52 → 2360.72] standard or not really anything too exotic okay um well thank you for that that was wonderful that was
[2360.72 → 2366.64] just one heck of a story uh thanks Wendell uh how late you guys game in tonight uh probably another
[2366.64 → 2370.88] hour or two I'll take some more pictures and post them on Twitter afterward bummer okay I'll probably
[2370.88 → 2374.56] I'll probably miss you then we were going to play some left for dead 2 later but I know you guys are
[2374.56 → 2380.00] like over eastern you're eastern time right yeah yeah yeah okay all right that's well past my bedtime
[2380.00 → 2383.68] all right I'll catch you I'll catch you another time I'll catch you another time thanks Wendell
[2384.48 → 2389.76] sounds good thank you take care all right, so guys make sure that you uh go check out um
[2389.76 → 2395.68] Wendell on Twitter so that's uh what it is it at level one text I think so uh
[2398.24 → 2408.56] tech Wendell t-e-k Wendell oh okay it's also at uh level one text but okay i suspect the
[2408.56 → 2415.84] toilet seats are going to be on the personal account all right um but yeah all right sounds good uh okay
[2415.84 → 2421.36] cool well now we know I don't know that that knowledge enriches my life particularly but uh
[2421.36 → 2428.24] thank you for that Wendell enriched mine did it okay good you know what enriches me this message
[2428.24 → 2438.56] from our sponsor uh ridge wallet wait all right oh wait are these not right uh oh um uh
[2438.56 → 2445.44] uh wrong whoever put the sponsors in the thing um kind of served it I think because I have two
[2445.44 → 2451.12] different sets I have one set of the like lower of the lower thirds like the copy and then I have
[2451.12 → 2458.16] another set of talking points um we can fix this hold on uh no, no I just don't know which set is right
[2458.80 → 2464.16] oh okay and I have no way of knowing we might have to do another top emergency topic
[2464.16 → 2471.12] uh okay that's such a good segue though now oh what a waste is entering beta the like a public
[2471.12 → 2476.32] beta soon Tuesday 60 Starlink satellites were launched and when they're in position the public
[2476.32 → 2481.52] beta will start uh Elon Musk is unsure when the satellites will reach their target position but it
[2481.52 → 2488.88] will probably be within a couple of months the satellites will reach their target altitude in about 45 days
[2488.88 → 2496.24] which is done in batches of 20 so it'll be about 135 days total uh this puts the satellites in position
[2496.24 → 2505.36] around February 18th 2021 it's a little bit more than a couple of months um must say the public beta will
[2505.36 → 2513.04] be available fall of 2020 okay so maybe that this is all over the place uh with only certain areas
[2513.04 → 2518.16] getting coverage a limited beta okay so when like one batch goes up they're starting public yet
[2518.88 → 2524.08] a limited beta has been currently already running in rural areas of Washington state there's been some
[2524.08 → 2528.88] really cool news about that actually uh if you want to look into it there's some people that have
[2528.88 → 2532.88] always had issues getting internet connections that now have like decently high speed internet it's
[2532.88 → 2538.24] really actually pretty sweet um and apparently this has been oh yeah this has been useful for oh I didn't
[2538.24 → 2543.04] know this part it's been useful for first responders in rural areas of Washington during the wildfires
[2543.04 → 2550.96] uh in the wildfires uh the last year uh the last year was that ISPS were price gouging first responders
[2550.96 → 2555.04] because they were using too much data, and they were charging them tons and tons of money I remember
[2555.04 → 2561.20] talking about that online show, so this is a little bit better news than that um so yeah that's exciting
[2561.20 → 2568.08] I'm definitely going to try this out just because it's me too for sure it's just such an interesting
[2569.60 → 2577.60] transition for technology you know like this is just wild I don't know i I will try it out in
[2577.60 → 2582.80] the public beta probably not use it again for at least a very extreme amount of time but super
[2582.80 → 2589.68] interesting idea it'll make like I remember on a couple trips that I've done like okay maybe you get
[2589.68 → 2594.88] a local sim something like that something that I started doing more recently was you get the like
[2596.48 → 2603.20] like Google's ISP thing, and you can do it through Sim oh okay, and you can just subscribe for like a
[2603.20 → 2608.08] little bit a little bit of time but all you really need is some data so if you can start using Starlink
[2608.08 → 2617.12] in those situations could be kind of cool the GMC hummer infotainment system will be powered by
[2617.76 → 2625.20] by Unreal Engine um what does this mean uh basically you get a pretty cool looking graphic on your car
[2625.20 → 2632.00] screen and that might be basically it, but it could mean more in the future maybe could mean better
[2632.00 → 2637.36] running better looking infotainment systems which um especially for ones that come directly from
[2638.00 → 2643.84] the car manufacturer and aren't like basically done by apple or whatever else that's very needed in my
[2643.84 → 2653.84] opinion yeah absolutely it's so bad i I would be I would be so thrilled to just see like I mean everything
[2653.84 → 2661.68] from it being more responsive to yeah just having a like a like a cooler looking interface like
[2661.68 → 2668.40] everything about that could absolutely be better literally potential uh better like touch detection
[2668.40 → 2673.44] like there 's's a lot of things they could do with this um so while right now it might just mean
[2673.44 → 2680.96] a prettier graphic moving forward it is might mean a lot more than just cool all right uh sponsors for
[2680.96 → 2686.08] the show today ridge wallet stop carrying pointless items around in your pockets like receipts old hotel
[2686.08 → 2690.24] room keys or spent gift cards with the ridge wallet you'll carry less because it doesn't hold that much

[2831.20 → 2841.36] dramatic topic of the week MSI was accused of scalping their own RTX 3080 inventory they well
[2841.36 → 2846.96] actually let's let's go through this in chronological order yeah I have an interesting
[2846.96 → 2853.12] question for you on this one but hit me start with that we should maybe go through the okay
[2854.48 → 2860.00] you didn't have all MSI pc and the sponsorship just so I'm assuming it was a sponsorship
[2860.00 → 2863.28] just so happened to be right now is that legit yes
[2863.28 → 2871.20] it's like how does that feel it's like they're trying to make me look bad
[2874.72 → 2883.92] okay can I ask when was that agreed to oh man months ago like yeah okay maybe not months but
[2883.92 → 2891.04] definitely weeks multiple weeks like we've had the parts on hand yes we've had the parts on hand for a
[2891.04 → 2899.60] while like unbelievable so i saw that tweet go out and I was like okay I know this for a fact
[2899.60 → 2905.52] was not like a knee-jerk thing there's no way this was planned out like a day or two ago this must have
[2905.52 → 2914.00] been way in the past, but now they're stuck with this project, so oh man the good news is that I was right
[2914.00 → 2921.68] about the MSI scandal so what happened was it broke on Reddit that uh I think it's called like MSI
[2922.24 → 2926.00] no, no no, no no what's it what's it called they didn't actually put any notes in here for me on
[2926.00 → 2932.32] this which is yeah just says talking point pretty, pretty annoying so I think it's called like starlet
[2932.32 → 2939.04] starlet partner seller or something like that is what it's called one bay starlet partner and i
[2939.04 → 2945.12] don't know if you guys know this but MSI stands for microstar international so um starlet partner
[2945.12 → 2951.28] has a long history of a long sales history they had like 1500 reviews with pretty with a pretty high
[2951.28 → 2958.56] rating and as far as anyone could tell they only sold MSI products and so it looked as though these
[2958.56 → 2966.24] this was like kind of MSI um MSI eBay store MSI eBay store like sell direct to customers kind of eBay
[2966.24 → 2970.32] store, and they're not the only ones that have done something like that but what people were upset
[2970.32 → 2979.04] about was that MSI had RTX 3080s listed there for like double the MSRP so around 1500 us dollars I mean
[2979.04 → 2986.00] that's the price of the RTX 3090 if MSRP which I guess no one cares about anymore is anything to go by
[2986.00 → 2992.08] so people got mad because they were like hey you know the messaging from NVIDIA is like we're trying
[2992.08 → 2996.96] really hard to get these cards into the hands of gamers at the price that we said they were supposed
[2996.96 → 3004.88] to be, and then you got partners like MSI running around selling them for apparently 13.59 uh 13.59
[3004.88 → 3009.68] was what they had it listed for so that is a little less than double the price sorry excuse me I'm
[3009.68 → 3016.08] correct I'll correct myself here um, so people were understandably outraged because you know here is
[3016.64 → 3021.28] everyone else in good faith trying to get these cards into the hands of real gamers instead of
[3021.28 → 3029.76] scalpers and here's MSI profiteering off of this extremely allocated card all right so as this was
[3029.76 → 3035.28] blowing up I had a conversation with I don't know if I don't know if he wants me to talk about who it
[3035.28 → 3041.76] was but I had a conversation with a buddy of mine in the tech space and I was like look here's my here's
[3041.76 → 3049.68] my hypothesis here's my theory um I think this is probably just I think this is real, so there was
[3049.68 → 3056.40] some initial uh doubt about whether starlit partner was even MSI um so everyone was like digging into
[3056.40 → 3061.28] like trademark registrations and all kind of stuff and I was like ah this looks like MSI to me, it smells
[3061.28 → 3068.40] like MSI it looks like MSI it's probably MSI and as it turns out it was MSI and then from there uh there
[3068.40 → 3073.84] was oh great so as part of the process this uh this friend of mine called up starlit and was like
[3074.48 → 3080.24] this is weird because okay I could believe it's MSI from like uh from like the kind of things they're
[3080.24 → 3086.64] selling and the long history of existing and all that stuff um they're good rating for example
[3086.64 → 3091.92] but it was weird because I like called them and it was just gone to like some guy's voicemail
[3091.92 → 3099.28] and I was like all right I'm once again going to lean on my experience working for a computer
[3099.92 → 3104.80] it's hard to it's hard to classify NCI because on the one hand they're like a small time like hole
[3104.80 → 3110.16] in the wall computer store but on the other hand they peaked at like 200 million dollars a year revenue
[3110.16 → 3116.80] and like 250 employees but they never really outgrew that attitude so I was like okay let me share
[3116.80 → 3124.00] a little anecdote with you from my time at NCI because here's my theory I think the eBay team
[3124.00 → 3128.64] pretty much just like somehow got their hands on some of these and we're like wow this would look
[3128.64 → 3134.72] perfect on our PNL report for the month um so for those of you not familiar PNL is profit and loss
[3134.72 → 3140.32] and typically if you have a small team working on kind of weirdo side project like that they would
[3140.32 → 3145.28] have some kind of KPIs that they're supposed to hit like you know oh you need to move through
[3145.84 → 3151.84] x number of dollars in dead stock a month or you need to uh sell it you know x amount of profit
[3151.84 → 3156.24] which would incentivize them to put up more attractive looking listings with better pictures
[3156.24 → 3162.48] um so that they would stand out um so my take on it was the eBay team probably got their hands on these
[3162.48 → 3168.80] things somehow either by accident or through like conniving to get access to them decided to sell them
[3168.80 → 3172.56] probably thought they were doing the company a favour by making way more money on these things
[3172.56 → 3181.76] and uh and that's i probably not like I know the guy that runs MSI USA and like he's a good guy like i
[3181.76 → 3189.12] don't I I don't think there's any way that he would have known anything about this um
[3189.12 → 3195.68] um the like one of the weird things that I saw was, and it was actually posted by spartaman64
[3195.68 → 3204.24] yeah um a huge poster on the Ltd forum, but it's an it's an Amazon link to the seller details of starlit
[3204.24 → 3210.56] partner yeah and their detailed seller information has their business name as MSI computer corp
[3210.56 → 3216.24] yes and their business address as like city of industry blah blah blah yes, but that could have
[3216.24 → 3220.88] potentially been faked at least over the short term absolutely the thing that made me pretty sure was
[3220.88 → 3226.24] that they'd existed for so long and had so many reviews with that address listed like clearly someone
[3226.24 → 3231.60] would have had to return something at some point and someone would have noticed that like um you know
[3231.60 → 3236.16] the address doesn't matter whatever is this graphics card coming from yeah so I figured it was as
[3236.16 → 3242.80] simple as the eBay oh right so back to my anecdote um so NCI they were a small hole
[3242.80 → 3248.32] in the wall computer shop, but they were also like a national chain and I was like I'm going to let you in
[3248.32 → 3254.08] on something our eBay store which was how we got rid of a lot of the open box and refurbished items or
[3254.08 → 3260.16] dead stock items that we just couldn't promote you know in a more conventional way had one guy running it
[3260.16 → 3268.00] Tim and if you called the number you got Tim's voicemail and my friend's like really and I'm like
[3268.00 → 3276.08] yeah like that doesn't surprise me at all like not one bit so on the one hand even companies that do
[3276.08 → 3280.16] like the numbers that you push back than like a lot of times you're doing so many things that
[3280.72 → 3285.36] that sections especially small sections they're very likely ran by just one person with very little
[3285.36 → 3290.08] oversight and exactly that's the thing is like you could look at it and go no there's no way in the
[3290.08 → 3298.72] side I wouldn't know about this like okay NCI was a relatively small partner of MSI back in the
[3298.72 → 3305.36] day and this relatively small partner I would be ordering anywhere from 300 to like 800 video cards a
[3305.36 → 3312.72] week MSI is not noticing like four graphics cards being sold on the eBay store this is a rounding error
[3312.72 → 3320.00] for a business of that magnitude so it's like yeah we can go all conspiracy theory tinfoil hat like oh yeah
[3320.00 → 3328.32] they were profiteering get real that's not that that's not realistic anyone with the
[3328.32 → 3335.84] foresight uh to make actual business decisions wouldn't have time to deal with whatever the eBay guys are
[3335.84 → 3342.40] doing and also would know better than to get caught selling graphics cards for double the price
[3342.40 → 3350.96] so that that's that was my take on it um I actually have not kept up uh with what anyone else has said
[3350.96 → 3356.24] about it so I don't know I don't know if I don't know if whoever I was talking to I don't know if
[3356.24 → 3361.20] they've come out and said they were talking to me about it, I don't know what ended up actually happening
[3361.20 → 3367.60] for sure but um yeah i just oh apparently I was okay no apparently I was mentioned by name so I was
[3367.60 → 3372.24] talking to Steve about it apparently uh Steve from gamers nexus did talk about our conversation so how
[3372.24 → 3379.04] did that turn out you guys have to let me know in the chat uh i I didn't actually watch it I was
[3379.04 → 3385.04] busy making my own videos i it makes sense to me that like the dude that runs the eBay thing
[3385.04 → 3387.84] was like hey I can like to make my numbers look better
[3389.92 → 3394.24] yeah I wouldn't be surprised if that happened uh people are like MSI admitted it yeah what
[3394.24 → 3398.48] do you mean MSI admitted what that was never that was never a question for me starlit partner was
[3398.48 → 3405.84] definitely MSI um so apparently uh the net that did it does Steve basically called customer
[3405.84 → 3411.76] support before he started contacting his Taiwan contacts man Steve goes hardcore Steve goes hardcore
[3411.76 → 3416.80] I love Steve it's like yeah I'm like I'm going to learn Chinese so that I can like
[3418.00 → 3423.52] talk to the real engineers and stuff like man uh yeah I love that guy I love that guy
[3424.08 → 3429.60] um, so people aren't saying that uh how many they wouldn't want to risk something like that for such
[3429.60 → 3434.88] a small amount of money uh someone on Twitter said something like Linus did about how they're so big
[3434.88 → 3438.48] they wouldn't want to risk something like that for a small amount of money jay said go away the adults
[3438.48 → 3444.88] are talking now that's i I strongly disagree with jay's sentiment there everyone that I know at MSI
[3444.88 → 3452.40] who actually is in a position of authority has way more common sense like you have no idea the kind of
[3452.40 → 3458.00] impact that it would be on MSI's business for them to be doing something like that and get caught by
[3458.00 → 3467.20] a partner like nvidia holds so much power over their partners and has made it very, very clear
[3468.00 → 3472.88] um apparently tech linked said it wasn't MSI oh bloody hell you guys i I'm sorry I did not
[3472.88 → 3477.52] perfect example of not every single part of a company having perfect oversight from the CEO all
[3477.52 → 3483.76] the time yeah pretty much there are things that happen um oh man now I'm all distracted what was
[3483.76 → 3494.16] I saying again uh you're talking about uh jay oh nvidia's power so if NVIDIA were to discover
[3494.16 → 3501.76] that MSI was profiteering off of RTX 3080s I can pretty much guarantee you I can guarantee you from
[3501.76 → 3508.40] my experience dealing with NVIDIA dealing with their partners like the amount of fear of NVIDIA that
[3508.40 → 3514.72] exists in the industry is its palpable um NVIDIA's actions would go something along these lines uh
[3514.72 → 3522.80] their quarters MDF would be either cut or eliminated their allocation of future RTX 3080 would be either
[3522.80 → 3532.16] cut or eliminated for some period of time like NVIDIA has the means to make their partners bleed because
[3532.16 → 3539.76] RTX 3080 chips are effectively like money they're just money the more of them that NVIDIA can make
[3539.76 → 3545.84] right now the more money NVIDIA can print yeah because like I think I'm not the only one getting
[3545.84 → 3550.56] to this point, but this is this if you can get the stuff and I mean some of it's not even out yet but
[3550.56 → 3555.36] it's coming soon this is a fantastic time to build a new computer the last generation of graphics cards was
[3556.64 → 3561.68] like I've been talking about that for a few shows now it was not very good for a lot of reasons
[3561.68 → 3569.28] and the last step of processors was like continually very impressive but still had some wins on the
[3569.28 → 3575.60] other side right now you have like a fantastic card at a great price and a fantastic processor at a
[3575.60 → 3581.68] great price that are like new shiny fancy options so I suspect a lot of people are trying to get stuff
[3581.68 → 3588.08] and like lands just said if you can ship it is just it's immediate money every time flower says uh Steve
[3588.08 → 3592.40] basically said that even though the high ups at MSI didn't notice it was still unacceptable yep sounds
[3592.40 → 3597.92] about right yeah um, but it's also the kind of thing that like in fairness to MSI hasn't come up in a
[3597.92 → 3603.68] while when was the last time there was a GPU that was so allocated that weeks after launch nobody could
[3603.68 → 3610.64] get one still it's been years and years and years and I mean that's how that's how new policies get made
[3610.64 → 3615.68] is you have to kind of come up against an edge case where the existing policy didn't work, and you have to
[3615.68 → 3623.84] do fix it so yeah NVIDIA carries a huge stick and there there there's no way that anyone who
[3624.80 → 3630.24] interacts with NVIDIA at all would have approved something like that, but it's definitely a good
[3630.24 → 3634.48] call that they're putting policies in place to prevent it in the future because it's not acceptable
[3634.48 → 3639.76] like it's still profiteering even if they didn't know they were doing it yes yeah oh yeah no it's not
[3639.76 → 3645.44] a good thing I think we're just kind of explaining that like the leadership very likely didn't know
[3646.56 → 3651.92] yeah um, but yeah should still be addressed someone in float plane chat said like there should
[3651.92 → 3657.68] be refunds or the difference between the like raised price and the stock price should be
[3657.68 → 3663.76] sent over like those are interesting ideas another thing that someone in float plane chat brought up if I can
[3663.76 → 3671.12] find it i just accidentally scrolled away from it clinic uh said talk about am5 do you think the 5950x
[3671.12 → 3676.96] is a dead-end CPU on am4 this is something I meant to actually talk about earlier in the show and forgot
[3676.96 → 3685.12] I'd be very surprised if it's not um although I okay, so there are a few things here, so one is we know that ddr5
[3685.12 → 3692.80] is in production I think it was micron did micron post a picture of a module the other day ddr5 exists
[3692.80 → 3699.28] now and ram doesn't really tend to exist until there's a platform that's going to support it
[3699.28 → 3705.68] that needs to be developed yeah um for them to put it in and then that timeline is you know anywhere from
[3706.40 → 3713.44] usually what 12 to 18 months something along those lines so that uh that falls really nicely in line
[3713.44 → 3723.68] with am5 which I think has AMD confirmed um ddr5 on am5 blah blah blah AMD zen 4 dozen 5 blah blah
[3723.68 → 3729.84] am5 platform in 2022 USB 4 something something something this looks like a rumour this is a rumour
[3730.32 → 3735.12] um so it leaked out over at gamers nexus ignore the naming because they went and skipped 4 000 so I guess
[3735.12 → 3741.28] it would probably be 6 000 um I would be very, very surprised
[3741.28 → 3749.12] to see an am5 CPU work on a x570 board but I also wouldn't be um
[3750.96 → 3757.04] I mean it wouldn't be impossible we have seen CPUs in the past that have had memory controllers that can
[3757.04 → 3761.68] communicate with multiple standards if I recall correctly I mean I know there were definitely
[3761.68 → 3765.84] platforms that supported multiple ones but I'm actually I'm a little hazy on whether that was through
[3765.84 → 3770.96] the chipset or whether that was actually through an integrated memory controller you guys will have to
[3771.68 → 3778.80] help me out here integrated memory controller ddr2 ddr3 it would have been kind of back in those days
[3778.80 → 3784.64] I'm pretty sure we've seen mobile CPUs that have support for both ddr2 and ddr3 or ddr3 ddr4
[3785.36 → 3790.80] just one thing I made a mistake yeah um they the Emma and I want to address it because the i
[3790.80 → 3794.96] flow plane chat's freaking out and I'm sure all the other chats are freaking out too um so that
[3794.96 → 3800.48] was not a like suggestion that is what they're doing um they have fully I know you mentioned
[3800.48 → 3805.20] this, but they fully clarified it was four graphics cards in total in the US only, and they have said
[3805.20 → 3810.40] that individual customers who purchase these GPUs uh they offered to they offered two options to the
[3810.40 → 3815.60] customers the customers can return the product and receive a full refund or a partial refund of the
[3815.60 → 3822.24] amount paid over MSI's MSRP and moving forward MSI will enforce a strip tor policy to avoid a situation
[3822.24 → 3827.04] like this happening again but yeah those were not suggestions those were that is specifically what
[3827.04 → 3834.16] MSI is doing and I think that that sounds completely acceptable to me, i I don't know some people are just
[3834.16 → 3840.24] honestly being kind of stupid about it um Torah Sabbath uh says giving price difference between MSRP and
[3840.24 → 3846.40] price charged, or a refund is not a nice idea what are you talking what else would you do like
[3847.28 → 3853.84] what are you talking about if i had the cash to throw around on a like very priced up graphics
[3853.84 → 3860.64] card and someone else probably not even me figured out that it wasn't like that it was technically MSI and
[3860.64 → 3864.96] they were like being weird annoying scalpers yeah and I just got a ton of money back I'd be super
[3864.96 → 3870.16] stoked I'd be like thanks if I was like personally offended by the fact that that whole situation
[3870.16 → 3874.08] even happened despite the fact that I bought a scalped graphics card so I don't really know how
[3874.08 → 3879.92] I have much to say in that situation but if I was, i just return and get all my money back easy oh hold
[3879.92 → 3886.56] on I see what happened here this was the clone there's two u's in the name so he's insane that's
[3886.56 → 3894.48] why he's upset about this solution what oh I thought you would I thought this was some Star Wars lore that
[3894.48 → 3901.04] you would enjoy wait sorry where is the the the username in uh on YouTube is Joris
[3901.04 → 3905.76] both or kibosh I don't know how to pronounce the last name okay nice yeah so let's see that so I was
[3905.76 → 3909.60] just i the only reason I responded to the comment was because I wanted to set up that punchline
[3911.92 → 3917.36] sorry I've been reading flow plane chat not those YouTube plebs apparently it's two r's not two u's
[3917.36 → 3924.40] dang, dang maybe I got it wrong whatever I'm okay with it so yeah it's bad and uh okay it's
[3924.40 → 3932.32] over um PlayStation 5 teardowns okay, so there are a few takeaways here giant cooler that's pretty cool
[3932.80 → 3939.04] he got him so i I know that one of Sony's one of Sony's key design points for the console has been
[3939.04 → 3944.88] that they want it to be able to turbo hard um so that's that's pretty sick uh what else we got here
[3945.52 → 3952.08] um the uh the side panels being so easily removable and potentially replaceable I had I talked to
[3952.08 → 3957.36] David at work he's already like yeah I'm for sure going to get some of the third party side panels
[3957.36 → 3961.76] that will for sure exist for this thing I was going to do a brand skin on the stock ones but
[3961.76 → 3965.92] now I'm going to wait and see what becomes available as a third party option because
[3966.80 → 3973.12] that's pretty sick like as a way to customize a console that was clearly designed to look stand out
[3973.12 → 3977.84] right yeah I like it, I like it, I'm into it what what what were the standouts for you
[3977.84 → 3986.00] uh it's its huge and like we already knew that but oh my goodness I know right like seeing a person
[3986.00 → 3995.76] for scale like and hands working on if it's like crazy and especially max like I put an Xbox series
[3995.76 → 4001.20] x in my media console last week as part of like a preview video that's going to go up soon and I was
[4001.20 → 4010.16] like wow it like fits you know PlayStation 5 where is it going to fit like that's a problem how does
[4010.16 → 4018.08] this fit into my living room setup you know it's interesting I don't know and like watching the
[4018.08 → 4023.28] these two things from the teardown video the audio is like terrible and the dude is the least interested
[4023.28 → 4030.80] in this process you could like possibly be which was uh you know interesting but yeah my main takeaway
[4030.80 → 4040.08] from it honestly like the cooler is awesome, but the thing is just gigantic oh i I lied apparently
[4040.08 → 4044.72] that preview with the Xbox Series X is already up on float plane so I don't know when it's coming up on
[4044.72 → 4052.40] YouTube um yeah so anyway uh other key takeaways here uh the m.2 expansion slot was shown so it also
[4052.40 → 4058.40] has convenient holes for vacuuming out dust that are also located under the side panels fascinating
[4058.40 → 4065.12] that's great it's good to see someone like apple set so many industry trends and like not
[4065.12 → 4069.52] giving any about the fact that dust is going to build up in the cooling of your system is one of
[4069.52 → 4075.28] the ones that I find most egregious like especially when they design their systems to run like right at
[4075.28 → 4081.12] the red line right out of the factory the fact that they don't include any dust filtration on the mac pro
[4081.12 → 4086.64] the new mac pro was something that I was just looking at going man you guys addressed so many of the
[4086.64 → 4094.00] other problems couldn't you just put a dust filter in it like come on um so it's really nice to see a
[4094.00 → 4103.52] console finally address this uh arms dedicated cooling uh massive cooler let's see instead of
[4103.52 → 4111.12] typical paste for thermal interface material this was so cool liquid metal yeah with the light with the
[4111.12 → 4118.80] like foam dam or whatever yeah yeah yeah so we've seen this done before to my knowledge Asus was the
[4118.80 → 4124.88] first to ship a commercial product with it in their mothership laptop I think they were the first and it
[4124.88 → 4130.16] was not a simple process from what they told me because it's not liquid metal is not just a matter of
[4130.16 → 4135.68] like apply it once and forget about it, it seeps like it's liquid at room temperature so it can like
[4135.68 → 4140.64] come out it can short things it can all come out so it's not even in there anymore and you
[4140.64 → 4147.60] don't get good thermal transfer so Sony apparently tackled it in a pretty similar manner to Asus um
[4149.04 → 4153.84] going for like uh like a kind of dam around it that'll keep the liquid metal in place hopefully i
[4153.84 → 4157.28] saw some people saying oh that's so stupid you're going to have to replace it every I saw someone say
[4157.28 → 4161.92] that you're going to have to replace every three to six months what are you like are you insane
[4161.92 → 4166.80] are you Joris to both the second clone here or something because there's a can you imagine a
[4166.80 → 4172.24] company the size of Sony and I get it big companies can still make boneheaded mistakes but can you
[4172.24 → 4178.24] imagine with how well known the properties of liquid metal are a company like Sony being stupid enough
[4178.24 → 4182.24] to make it so you have to reapply your thermal interface material every three to six months like
[4182.24 → 4190.08] what like what are you talking about yeah and like it's cool that it seems like the teardown
[4190.08 → 4195.12] experience actually seems like decently well-thought-out yeah not, not difficult to do i
[4195.12 → 4201.04] remember like trying to take apart Xbox 360s because those just broke all over the place so like
[4201.04 → 4209.28] people doing zombified repair jobs on Xbox 360s was like a genuine hobby um but i I like looking at this
[4209.92 → 4216.48] tearing it down looks so convenient and accessing those like expansion ports and stuff seems great like
[4216.48 → 4220.88] I wanted to address the like Memling that's happened like Xbox tried to meme this a little
[4220.88 → 4224.80] bit by showing that their expansion port essentially is just like plugging something into the back of
[4224.80 → 4232.80] the console but like yeah, but this is pretty cool, and it's not a bad solution um and the techie
[4232.80 → 4240.08] side of me likes it because it's like kind of there's a lot of modern stuff like we've lost tactile
[4240.08 → 4246.40] interaction like getting a new game you just download it like you don't have the physical copy anymore
[4246.48 → 4251.60] it's just there like watching a movie you don't go to the store to get if it's just you just stream it
[4251.60 → 4257.04] like there 's's so much less that you do with things um and I think it's kind of cool that like
[4257.04 → 4262.40] and i I know definitely as a kid I would have even appreciated this more like if I bought an expansion
[4262.40 → 4267.44] thing for my PlayStation and I had to like to take it apart like see the internals and like actually add
[4267.44 → 4272.48] something to this system and put it back together myself like that's such a cool experience i I wouldn't
[4272.48 → 4279.36] always oh my goodness the bird does not agree um I wouldn't always agree with that but because the
[4279.36 → 4286.96] teardown experience is actually like so good um that that makes me think more in that way you know
[4286.96 → 4291.92] what I mean yeah 100 I'm just reading chat jacks I'm not actually like multitasking I'm paying attention
[4291.92 → 4299.60] to Luke too they're like Linus multitasking right now no, no no, no no um the I love that both of the
[4299.60 → 4306.32] new consoles have nice large fans um I think I'm allowed to talk about that the Xbox Series X is
[4306.32 → 4312.64] quiet I'm not sure I will, I won't I I hope I'm allowed to talk about it, I don't know I didn't look
[4312.64 → 4318.08] that close there uh I'll wait I'll wait for the audio you didn't look that close yeah yeah it didn't
[4318.08 → 4324.48] look that close i I don't know I don't know there 's's like a whole set of like guidelines and
[4324.48 → 4328.96] stuff and we haven't worked with Microsoft on the console side of things that much the last thing
[4328.96 → 4334.72] I want to do is like say something that's technically under embargo still and like get in trouble um so
[4334.72 → 4340.08] we're just we're going to take our time with it, we've got a ton of Xbox Series X content planned so far i
[4340.08 → 4345.20] don't think we have any confirmation that we're even getting a PlayStation 5 so hopefully we are but um
[4345.76 → 4350.96] we'll see how that goes anyway i I love that Sony went liquid metal it really does make a big
[4350.96 → 4356.64] difference like for the same heat sink solution if you're borderline with a more conventional
[4356.64 → 4361.04] thermal interface material liquid metal will probably push you across the finish line so
[4361.04 → 4367.12] I'm excited to see what the performance looks like regardless of the theoretical gigaflops that
[4367.12 → 4373.84] both Sony and Microsoft have been throwing around yeah um in other Sony news Sony revealed a list
[4373.84 → 4378.00] of PlayStation 4 games that will not run on the PlayStation 5.
[4378.00 → 4386.08] yeah DVR Afro samurai 2 TT Isle of Man just deal with it shadow complex remastered Robinson the
[4386.08 → 4395.60] journey we sing hitman go shad win and Joe's diner should be all right so i I don't recognize most of
[4395.60 → 4403.60] these names one of them that stood out to me was hitman go because it's a mobile game yeah it should be
[4403.60 → 4410.56] okay it's probably fine if you really miss it oh I don't want to pull a blizzard but oh boy I was
[4410.56 → 4415.12] going to say if you really miss it you can play it on your phone but like i I don't yeah I don't know i
[4415.12 → 4420.64] I have a feeling that's not the only one in here that's probably more on the mobile side of things
[4420.64 → 4425.60] yeah so uh we don't know why they won't run could be due to licensing issues there are also some general
[4425.60 → 4430.80] PlayStation 5 backwards compatibility limitations for PS4 games, so the share menu can't be displayed
[4430.80 → 4436.40] within PS4 games running on a PS5 screenshots will need to be generated using the create button on a
[4436.40 → 4442.32] dual sense controller a tournaments feature from PS4 is also not compatible with the PS5 nor is in-game
[4442.32 → 4447.76] live or second screen apps and game companion apps, so there are going to be some things that are not
[4447.76 → 4453.28] going to be quite the same as the original experience but with yeah just 10 titles ruled out
[4453.28 → 4460.08] um it looks like what we're headed towards for both Microsoft and Sony now that they're both just
[4460.08 → 4468.24] x86 boxes with AMD graphics cards in them is potentially just backwards and backwards compatibility
[4468.24 → 4474.64] pretty much across the board like I'd be shocked if Xbox whatever boneheaded thing they call it
[4474.64 → 4484.48] is backwards compatible with uh series x and x that isn't a series um and 360 and like all that
[4484.48 → 4489.28] good stuff and I'd also be surprised if Sony PlayStation 6 because they're sensible it's
[4489.28 → 4494.56] probably what it'd be called is backwards compatible going way, way back mesh
[4496.48 → 4501.68] um Sony says select PS4 games will work with PS5's game boost feature that will make older PS4 games run
[4501.68 → 4506.64] at higher frame rates, but we don't have a list of games that will support that feature just yet so
[4506.64 → 4516.80] I've been looking into like random games on this list uh so far uh Afro samurai 2 has a 21 metacritic
[4516.80 → 4529.92] score oof um shadow complex was released in 2009 originally on the Xbox 360 like i yeah I don't think we're
[4529.92 → 4534.80] yeah I think it's probably okay I think we're not missing out on much here should be all right
[4534.80 → 4542.24] yeah yeah I think we're all right so uh finally apple's t2 security chip has an unfixable flaw
[4545.76 → 4554.88] so now you lose your data um but hey it was all for security hey you got them uh okay so a recently
[4554.88 → 4560.56] released tool by hacking group check rain is letting anyone exploit an unusual mac vulnerability
[4560.56 → 4566.72] to bypass apple's trusted t2 security chip and gain deep system access the hack is based on the
[4566.72 → 4570.56] checkmate crack that has been used to jailbreak holder iPhones and iPads for some time now which
[4570.56 → 4576.72] relies on a similar if not identical flaw in the t2 security chip the t2 chip provides secure encryption
[4576.72 → 4581.60] and storage access for features like touch ID and full disk encryption and has been criticized for
[4581.60 → 4586.48] causing an inability to install third-party operating systems outside of apple's official bootcamp support
[4587.44 → 4592.64] one hacker has apparently even gotten the broken t2 chip to run Linux on the macBook touch bar
[4592.64 → 4598.56] wow that's pretty cool critically for apple the access also means that activation lock can be bypassed
[4598.56 → 4603.84] which could result in a rise in theft in apple of Apple devices that's a bummer because that's one of
[4603.84 → 4611.04] the things that's really nice about full disk encryption and this kind of like uh encryption
[4611.04 → 4619.20] chip locker tomfoolery is that you can basically leave a phone like if it's an if it's an encrypted
[4619.20 → 4623.76] device you could basically leave a phone somewhere and know that unless someone really just wants the
[4623.76 → 4629.04] like 14 that they'll get for giving it to a recycler there's a solid chance they'll call the number on
[4629.04 → 4633.84] your lock screen and try and return it to you because a locked phone is basically worthless
[4634.40 → 4641.60] um not any more file vault encryption keys are also stored in the t2 which means encrypted user data is
[4641.60 → 4646.24] also at risk if a device is stolen this is a big deal for all the enterprises that have a bunch of apple
[4646.24 → 4651.92] devices deployed to their staff and the flaw is apparently virtually unwatchable as a result of its
[4651.92 → 4656.80] low level nature meaning that all existing t2 enabled macs are likely vulnerable and will remain
[4656.80 → 4662.96] vulnerable indefinitely now there's some good news um it can't be done remotely and requires physical
[4662.96 → 4670.24] access to the vulnerable computer and that's rule number one of like electronics security is physical
[4670.24 → 4678.80] access is access so basically no changes there um, and it also isn't persistent so any changes to the t2
[4678.80 → 4682.88] are lost when it resets which is not necessarily at the same time the computer resets by the way
[4682.88 → 4688.40] check rain security researcher Danny l tweeted that the t2 exploit isn't as big as people might think
[4688.40 → 4693.12] because it's been known for over a year and other more serious vulnerabilities exist this attack requires
[4693.12 → 4698.08] deliberate targeting to be terrifying um Anthony's note is that this is interesting because if this
[4698.08 → 4702.00] has been known about widely in the security community it raises questions about anti-encryption
[4702.00 → 4710.88] legislation's rationale against apple yeah it does kind of doesn't it why do they even care if uh apple's encryption is there if it's just broken anyway
[4710.88 → 4717.04] if it's bad yeah, yeah well that's a whole that's almost like a whole separate Wang show ladies and
[4717.04 → 4722.16] gentlemen, and we don't have time for that because Luke and i have to play video games tonight we have to play
[4722.16 → 4729.12] some video games yeah, but before we do that I have to address that someone just sent 1200 Mexican dollars
[4729.84 → 4737.68] uh oh fabian says hey I got a refund on my missing order from Lt store and two months later the courier
[4737.68 → 4744.64] finally found my ship and I'm very happy with my order so here's the money back hey thank you appreciate
[4744.64 → 4753.20] that appreciate that shout out to Lt store.com by the way they had an outstanding week this week
[4753.20 → 4758.72] apparently we have a lot of long-armed followers we launched a shirt that I was basically like yeah
[4758.72 → 4763.84] the fit's weird it doesn't fit me right it's got like super long arms so if like you have long arms than
[4763.84 → 4770.72] go ahead and order it and all these people bought if it was our it was our biggest sales day ever
[4771.44 → 4778.32] I was like okay sure, so apparently that's the solution we need to start targeting niche fits so
[4780.32 → 4784.88] are nerds is that an is that a trait is that a common trait nerds I didn't think so
[4785.84 → 4789.28] but I mean the thing is you got like enough you have to you got 300 000 people
[4789.28 → 4795.44] so even if you know one percent of them have long arms that's like a lot of shirts it's like 3 000
[4795.44 → 4801.60] shirts right so yeah and if you consistently have a problem with the sleeves on your shirts being
[4801.60 → 4807.92] too short, and you hear like hey this shirt has long arms yeah I could see that being like a need you
[4807.92 → 4812.96] already know the qualities there yeah it's its probably a really cool shirt so if it fits you better
[4812.96 → 4818.64] like sweet sure what else so yeah that that's the new concept okay is we're going to do like kind of weird
[4818.64 → 4825.36] fits like hey if you have super stumpy legs we've got we've got the jobbers for you don't keep buying
[4825.36 → 4830.32] Capri pants you now and then wearing them as regular pants these are regular pants they're just
[4830.32 → 4836.32] short they're just really short yeah was that what what shirt was that uh the short circuit one
[4836.88 → 4843.28] yeah it looks really cool too yeah it's really nice uh do you have RTX voice on and is it still coming
[4843.28 → 4849.44] through i I don't have RTX voice because I don't have oh that's right oh sorry, sorry I don't speak
[4849.44 → 4856.96] poor people I think yeah economically sound is how I prefer to say it yeah yeah but yeah it's a really
[4856.96 → 4862.08] cool shirt and I like the sleeve art I think it's yeah it's dope I'm not going to bring it up on screen
[4862.08 → 4866.72] because I don't need that many more people buying it because I think we moved through like basically
[4866.72 → 4871.84] almost all of our initial inventory so I'm not I'm not I'm not supposed to push LTT store that hard this
[4871.84 → 4876.48] week because our shippers like way backed up and like we've moved through most of those shirts and
[4876.48 → 4882.16] stuff so maybe next week we'll have a launch for you or something uh Sergey says uh is there any
[4882.16 → 4886.88] difference in features between RTX 2000 and 3000 or is it just performance as far as I can tell it's
[4886.88 → 4894.00] just performance um there is some new video encode and decode stuff um but I actually don't quote me on
[4894.00 → 4900.64] that because I think RTX 2000 might be getting like backported some of the features of RTX 3000
[4901.84 → 4909.20] um does RTX 2000 get like the vp1 decoding oh dang it you cha you called me on this live
[4909.92 → 4919.60] uh vp1 decoding video decoding encode support matrix oh boy NVIDIA design works here we go
[4920.64 → 4928.72] um um dang it where's um where's wait do they not have ampere on here yet
[4928.72 → 4940.96] dang it NVIDIA vp1 uh vp1's not even on here okay well i got nothing for you, I'm sorry guys
[4940.96 → 4948.80] ampere's not on here yet so uh I don't remember there oh crap I hate getting uh blind sided by stuff
[4948.80 → 4955.84] like this and then not knowing speaking of uh blind sided, but you will know um it's also sorry
[4955.84 → 4959.36] that was actually my bad with the bird he was asking for food and I was just ignoring him and
[4959.36 → 4966.96] I didn't realize it but uh Amazon story you applied at Amazon oh right oh man I don't know we might have
[4966.96 → 4974.96] to talk about this next week I'm hungry okay, okay sorry guys or uh are you going to stream games tonight
[4974.96 → 4983.20] um I don't know yet I haven't decided okay, okay um uh someone brought up HDMI 2.1 yes that is a new
[4983.20 → 4989.84] feature so being able to run 4k at 120 hertz but then like sort of related to performance there's no
[4989.84 → 4997.84] there's no need for it if you uh there's no need for it if you don't have a 3000 series basically um
[4997.84 → 5004.88] Nintendo asks are those six xx or 58x on your head Linus these are HD 600s these are neither these
[5004.88 → 5013.04] are older so they're very similar to the 6x x's uh fan 24 Dr says if you expect something in return
[5013.04 → 5016.96] from someone on the other side of Vancouver is that a quid pro co quit lam
[5016.96 → 5029.28] what the response was great okay uh Henry stockman says would watch entire wan show but
[5029.28 → 5037.36] hollow live tubers are live so here so sent whatever 500 fps are I don't know what kind
[5037.36 → 5042.96] of money that is uh drama's llama says your mama's llama I want to buy some Ltd underwear but my wife
[5042.96 → 5046.64] won't let me unless they have Linus's face on them, I am serious and I really want to make this happen
[5047.36 → 5051.84] it's possible anything is possible we've got our new underwear supplier totally sorted out we've got
[5051.84 → 5057.20] the fit fixed I was wearing them this week I tried the mediums I think Nick tried the larges
[5058.08 → 5062.64] I think the entire sizing chart is now the same as the old ones so we are ready to rock on them and
[5062.64 → 5067.12] there's going to be some new designs, and hopefully we'll be able to roll them more quickly now I have
[5067.12 → 5073.92] a bone to pick with you and the Ltd store team okay what they do you have cooled you have cool designs
[5073.92 → 5084.48] mm-hmm high quality prices are banging where's your masks dude okay so we have a sample of a mask
[5084.48 → 5090.16] design I didn't really like it, I didn't really like the fit um as you probably know we don't launch
[5090.16 → 5095.84] anything that I'm not 100 happy with other than that shirt which I basically didn't even try to sell
[5095.84 → 5099.04] it I was like oh the arms are too long but then apparently you guys are into that so I don't know
[5099.04 → 5104.80] whatever um I wasn't happy with it basically, and it wasn't the design that I really wanted
[5104.80 → 5112.00] I wanted to do a subnet mask so I wanted to just have like 255.255.255.0 and then like some other
[5112.00 → 5116.16] common subnets down one side I thought that'd be like super cool and then I got some other design
[5116.16 → 5119.68] that was like based on our circuit board thing, and it's like yeah it looks all right but I wanted the
[5119.68 → 5123.76] subnet mask and I'm not really willing to launch anything other than that so that's my take on it right
[5123.76 → 5128.24] now okay well you guys should figure that out because it seems like the whole mask thing is
[5128.24 → 5134.64] probably here to stay for a while so yeah I know right um no name I booted up my old android phone
[5134.64 → 5139.12] to send you my Google play balance uh thank you twelve dollars and twelve cents uh okay
[5140.80 → 5147.52] uh I'll do like two more uh Ben Roberts asks Linus only fans when I don't know how much the wife would
[5147.52 → 5152.32] like it there that's going to be my excuse I'm going to hide you guys could do you guys could do an only
[5152.32 → 5163.44] fans that was purely uh like uh uh uh peels I can't remember the oh that's lame if I'm not if

[5192.32 → 5196.24] much use out of the bath gaming rig haven't really been gaming much but I have been watching TV in the
[5196.24 → 5201.44] bath it's been great my kids love it too uh dozen 5000 better for gaming except intel still has the
[5201.44 → 5208.08] the highest single core clock speed oh come on bro come on what year is it sure
[5208.08 → 5214.32] I'm sure I'm sure Linus media group somewhere has a good video about that and I'm also sure that like
[5214.32 → 5218.72] gamers nexus i I named him because he makes a lot of those types of videos but I'm sure a lot of other
[5218.72 → 5223.44] people have videos about that too it is not just clock speed my dude okay so I posted that in the
[5223.44 → 5230.48] YouTube chat there's our video addressing it on tech quickie um all right that's it, thank you guys
[5230.48 → 5238.16] very much for tuning in this week we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
