[0.00 --> 12.30]  and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen second time's a charm we've got a lot of great
[12.30 --> 16.52]  topics for you guys today and we're going to do our best as we go through them to sound like we're
[16.52 --> 21.68]  just learning about them for the first time I mean something I found out about really and
[21.68 --> 29.10]  legitimately not that long ago was Dr. Disrespect allegedly has been banned permanently from Twitch
[29.10 --> 33.86]  this is something that's not in our doc the earliest reference I can find to it is from
[33.86 --> 39.58]  about four or five hours ago so this is very much breaking news and we can talk a little bit about
[39.58 --> 46.52]  what the heck might be going on on Twitch right now because they are having a bit of a PR crisis
[46.52 --> 54.76]  at this moment in time in other news oh yeah more streaming news Microsoft Axis Mixer joins the dark
[54.76 --> 59.52]  site
[59.52 --> 60.52]  excuse me sorry oh
[60.52 --> 68.20]  ah Facebook gaming joins wow uh joins forces with Facebook gaming and there's a whole bunch of
[68.20 --> 75.10]  implications there and uh Luke I know you love the CPU topics I know you love it you know you love it
[75.10 --> 80.86]  tell us about tell us about the CPU this one this one in particular is actually quite fantastic Intel
[80.86 --> 84.66]  has theado platform for all the world the Google games tohaba which childhood the game
[84.66 --> 86.62]  and stuff is closely about I don't understand the UCEx a video so here's a podcast review
[86.62 --> 92.06]  and I'm gonna see what it looks like and listen so Gurira is MGM a demo Islamic
[92.06 --> 94.02]  31st symbole m違う yourriqueured online and ran a Elesden Robert Harrison um and
[94.02 --> 98.08]  Duke Hanna tried Chez Psydiacois all yit� with the estándep triangle in Tesla
[98.08 --> 99.30]  and they come on with Celera to defend anyone the Roiler of all of them there's a
[99.30 --> 101.52]  good Ouija kim doing that just you can do the JoshHHHH Champion playing the
[101.52 --> 103.70]  multiplayer game game that's anyway you all record campeon
[103.70 --> 108.90]  this topic microsoft to permanently close all physical retail stores there all of them all of
[108.90 --> 114.42]  them all the retail stores you have got to be kidding me surprise is the first time okay we
[114.42 --> 118.42]  say it a lot we say it a lot it's gonna be a great show today guys we got a lot to talk about today
[118.42 --> 124.74]  guys sometimes we lie sometimes we got nothing today we got everything there's so much fire this
[124.74 --> 130.02]  week okay it's fire it's fire ladies and gentlemen all right we're gonna let's just let's roll the
[130.02 --> 138.82]  intro and then i want to dive right into that intel thing because it is just brutal oh rolling that intro
[138.82 --> 163.54]  oh yeah right we gotta have some sponsors today uh uh but uh uh uh moss backpacks vesti footwear and
[163.54 --> 171.38]  anchor with the power expand power expand wow that really sounds a lot dirtier than it probably is
[172.18 --> 181.62]  power expand whoa it's hot hot just like the news this week okay uh why don't we jump into this intel
[181.62 --> 187.54]  thing right off the hop here this was posted they should uh they should enlarge that product stack
[187.54 --> 198.34]  and get like the power extend power extend the power girthinator the power spreader oh oh wow that
[198.34 --> 207.06]  is very very uncomfortable luke thank you for that mental image swelmo92 posted this on the forum and
[207.06 --> 214.58]  here's the story underscore row game a respected hardware leaker has just shared some slides from intel
[214.58 --> 222.02]  comparing gaming performance of their 10th generation 10 750h mobile processors in an msi gl65 laptop
[222.02 --> 229.06]  versus the amd zen 2 r9 4900hs mobile processor in the zephyrus g14 and if you guys remember from our
[229.06 --> 240.74]  review of the zephyrus g14 the ryzen 9 4900hs is i think the hs is short for hot stuff because that thing is
[240.74 --> 247.22]  freaking fire not that it actually runs hot it actually runs really cool its performance is just
[247.22 --> 254.50]  absolutely outstanding it is right up there when it comes to gaming with amd's desktop flagship processors
[254.98 --> 265.30]  um however intel soft fit to put amd in their place and these slides uh reference here hold on let's
[265.30 --> 271.54]  see if we can let's see if we can pull these slides up here because this is high freaking larious uh
[271.54 --> 278.50]  uh blah blah blah display capture um let's go ahead and uh not do that actually that's not what i meant
[278.50 --> 285.30]  to do uh you know what that actually worked out really great um fine sure let's roll with it here we go
[285.30 --> 291.54]  superior gaming performance for gamers with 10th gen core platforms at a lower price
[291.54 --> 299.30]  so base is sort of what they um the terminology they use to describe team red over here and then
[299.30 --> 315.78]  up to 20 better up to 22 better up to 18 better up to 20 better up to 23 better and not to forget up to
[315.78 --> 324.98]  23 better again except we've got a small problem here if we just use our technology to enhance
[325.86 --> 336.90]  enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance enhance okay if we enhanced it enough man this page does not
[336.90 --> 341.70]  does not enhance simulate very well here we let's let's enhance a different way hold on we've got more
[341.70 --> 346.18]  enhancing to do let me just enhance this hold on give me a second here ladies and gentlemen there
[346.18 --> 352.18]  we go kind of weird while you're busy enhancing yeah yeah is that the the they used little laptops
[352.18 --> 359.22]  to display this information but they look like macbooks oh is that later on in the thing uh we'll
[359.22 --> 362.90]  have to get to that later give me give me oh oh that's cute oh they're little laptops i thought they
[362.90 --> 368.90]  just had lines under them that's adorable no all right so this is interesting we've got a core i7 10750h
[368.90 --> 375.86]  right there got some base clocks and boost clocks got some core counts and tdp ratings and cool stuff
[375.86 --> 381.70]  like that oh yeah it's a 10 10 watt lower tdp for the amd processor that's interesting uh also noted in
[381.70 --> 392.50]  here is nvidia rtx 2060 and nvidia rtx 2060 max q now that wouldn't normally be as big of a problem except
[392.50 --> 401.54]  that nvidia has gone and created some very very confusion confusion around their rtx 2060 because
[401.54 --> 409.94]  they went and did a little thing where they refreshed their 2070 and 2080 mobile gpus with super variants
[410.50 --> 417.30]  and so it was very clear that those had better performance than the 2070 and 2080 that they
[417.30 --> 424.74]  replaced but then at the same time they went and replaced their 2060 without calling it a super
[424.74 --> 432.82]  but but they made the performance way better so what's actually going on here is the zephyrus g14
[432.82 --> 440.82]  is running an older version of the rtx 2060 that doesn't have the the super under the hood even though
[440.82 --> 448.42]  nvidia's marketing people didn't see fit to include that bloody information and the intel laptop even
[448.42 --> 454.42]  though it's running a uh oh yeah sorry is not only not running a max q but seems to be running a full tilt
[455.06 --> 462.82]  um 2060 so a max p as it's uh sort of colloquially known uh is not only running a max p but it's also
[462.82 --> 469.54]  running the newer variant this is this is this is this is my this is my understanding of what uh what
[469.54 --> 476.42]  went down here so uh so at the very least even if the the difference in uh hold on a second that's not
[476.42 --> 480.98]  in my notes the bit about um nvidia refreshing the card so maybe they're both new ones you know what
[480.98 --> 486.66]  it doesn't matter what they should have done at least yeah they should have just they should have
[486.66 --> 496.26]  just colored both bars green nvidia versus nvidia yeah so here's what happened okay at the very
[496.26 --> 501.14]  least even if into uh nvidia's branding thing which i went off about and isn't in my notes so maybe it's
[501.14 --> 506.34]  not true and i'm i'm very hesitant to like double down on stuff these days even if that isn't what
[506.34 --> 515.14]  happened at the very least it's a max q versus a max p we are talking a 65 watt gpu versus a 90 watt one
[515.14 --> 523.14]  and the 65 one 65 watt one is limited to a boost of about 1185 megahertz while the max p one the full
[523.14 --> 530.10]  tilt one runs at 1560. so that is an increase in clock speed of hold on just a moment here let me do
[530.10 --> 537.86]  some quick napkin math which i do in a calculator app now because what freaking year is it uh 1560. hold
[537.86 --> 544.26]  on luke can you just refresh me real quick here uh on uh what were the claims that intel made with respect
[544.26 --> 551.86]  to the performance delta between these two laptops these intel and amd laptops here at a minimum delta
[551.86 --> 560.74]  of 18 to 23 18 to 20 percent so 15 60 up to up to yes what was up to was 18 so how much is 23. how
[560.74 --> 568.10]  much is 1560 versus 1185 well that happens to be a 31.6 increase in clock speed
[568.10 --> 578.98]  that's real awkward yeah that's real it's real awkward right now it's got real awkward it's like
[578.98 --> 584.10]  there's a partial other throttle on the system yeah it's almost stopping it from going that much faster
[584.10 --> 589.86]  okay i wouldn't i wouldn't actually i wouldn't actually say that um because i mean i wouldn't
[589.86 --> 597.14]  actually say what they're saying yeah bumping bumping your gpu clock 25 does not yield 25 more frames per
[597.14 --> 604.74]  second so i don't want to i don't want to accuse intel of also being slower in addition to uh not
[604.74 --> 611.94]  doing these benchmarks correctly but here's the problem guys like this is the kind of stuff that
[611.94 --> 619.78]  makes like it's just embarrassing you know it's just you're either evil or stupid at this point
[619.78 --> 626.74]  those are the only two options and i will say at least they did it's a little slightly odd that they
[626.74 --> 633.38]  didn't bull uh i don't know if it's even a bold they didn't highlight in white the graphics card on
[633.38 --> 641.86]  the zephyrus g14 but they did on the msi gl65 at least they did include that information we have seen
[641.86 --> 649.14]  like inside benchmarks uh completely hide that type of information in the past they could have definitely
[649.14 --> 654.98]  just included the model of the laptop and not noted the graphics card that's in there because it
[654.98 --> 659.30]  probably would have covered that unless these are laptops that come in multiple variants but usually
[659.30 --> 667.62]  there would be a suffix of some kind um so there's like some things going for them there i guess at
[667.62 --> 672.34]  least they were very clear about what they were doing they just shouldn't have done it no they
[672.34 --> 675.54]  shouldn't have done it there's actually quite a few things in here that they shouldn't have done
[675.54 --> 683.46]  and there's something that really it man one of the reasons this bothers me is that when intel destroys
[683.46 --> 688.02]  their own credibility they go and destroy the credibility of people that they work with as well
[688.02 --> 693.22]  this has been bothering me since last night when i was reading the comments on a tech wiki video that
[693.22 --> 701.70]  we did on what exactly is a process node because i think to the to the layperson it's not really clear
[701.70 --> 712.82]  like why it is that 14 nanometer versus 10 nanometer is you know a full process node shrink you know or
[712.82 --> 720.82]  you know why is it that um why is it that going from 14 to 10 is a process node whereas going from
[720.82 --> 728.82]  uh hold on i it's hard to do this math in my head so hold on 90 times 0.7 equals uh 60.
[728.82 --> 732.58]  while you're doing that another thing that would have been really nice is if they if they actually
[732.58 --> 739.62]  like using base for every single one of uh the the amd performance lines is is kind of annoying
[739.62 --> 743.38]  oh we can get back to that the baseline is actually zero okay there's a bunch of stuff in there we're
[743.38 --> 746.98]  we're gonna get don't worry we're gonna get back to that we're gonna get back to that but we did a
[746.98 --> 752.10]  video basically just explaining why it is that you have to go from 90 nanometer all the way down to 65
[752.10 --> 758.50]  and then you only have to go from 14 nanometer down to 10 and then from 10 down to 7 to qualify
[758.50 --> 766.26]  as a full process node and the comments on we we reached out to intel to get some clarification on
[766.26 --> 774.18]  this subject because they were kind of there the whole time um and the video is nothing but factual
[774.18 --> 781.30]  and the people that we were talking to at intel were not just you know marketing wangers um or
[781.30 --> 788.10]  anything like that like they were actual technical people who we talked to um and instead of people
[788.10 --> 793.62]  just being able to look at this video and go hey here's some information about a thing that i didn't
[793.62 --> 801.38]  know about it's now stained by some of the marketing that intel is doing so when i said in the video
[801.38 --> 807.62]  um you know hey you got to remember that the process node is not the be-all and end-all people
[807.62 --> 812.98]  are misinterpreting that as some kind of an intel talking point that was actually something that i
[812.98 --> 819.06]  added on my own not because you got to remember a lot of intel's marketing over the years has been
[819.06 --> 827.38]  around how many freaking nanometers they're at and this video was an explainer of how that number and
[827.38 --> 833.30]  the meaning of it has actually shifted over time it's just informative it wasn't sponsored by intel
[833.94 --> 838.90]  and the information that's in the video is nothing to do with intel's current marketing messaging
[838.90 --> 844.42]  when i said that the thing that i was actually thinking of was nvidia versus amd right now
[845.54 --> 852.34]  amd is a node ahead of nvidia and getting absolutely curb stomped in terms of everything from performance
[852.34 --> 859.38]  to efficiency that is just the situation the reality of it is that not everything is just down
[859.38 --> 864.90]  to how many nanometers you have another example that i didn't get into in depth in the video because
[864.90 --> 870.02]  it was beyond the scope of the tech quickie like it's supposed to be quick it's supposed to be focused
[870.02 --> 877.86]  was that you can optimize a given manufacturing process like a given you know nanometer size a given
[877.86 --> 883.94]  transistor size you can optimize it for high power parts or low power parts i remember we ran into this
[883.94 --> 892.90]  when man which node was nvidia stuck on for freaking ever in the maxwell days um it escapes me right now
[892.90 --> 899.70]  it doesn't really matter the point is that there were smaller processes available but they were more
[899.70 --> 905.86]  optimized for high efficiency low power parts and were not properly optimized for a gpu which is why
[905.86 --> 912.42]  nvidia opted to stay on a previous node that had better optimizations for their use case versus
[912.42 --> 918.02]  just jumping to a node for the sake of having a lower you know nanometer number that they could put in
[918.02 --> 922.74]  their marketing that's the point i was trying to make and yet the comment section on this video is full
[922.74 --> 930.74]  of people accusing me intel basically accusing intel and by extension me of trying to downplay that amd
[930.74 --> 936.10]  is on seven nanometer and intel is still stuck on 14 nanometer for a lot of their products and just
[936.10 --> 941.38]  finally shipping some 10 nanometer stuff and it's like no that wasn't even one of the things intel
[941.38 --> 945.86]  mentioned that was just something that i felt was important for people to know and another thing that i
[945.86 --> 951.38]  said at the end of the video and this this is really pissing me off right now was i said that at the
[951.38 --> 958.34]  end of the day when you are shopping for a computer processor it comes down to the real world performance
[958.34 --> 965.86]  in the applications that you actually use and because of intel's stupid statements that they've
[965.86 --> 974.26]  been making recently about how pretty much downplaying actual real world performance in real benchmarks
[974.26 --> 979.78]  because they're making the argument that a lot of people don't use those particular applications
[981.30 --> 986.58]  i'm getting caught up in this kind of crossfire where people are saying i'm some kind of an intel
[986.58 --> 991.22]  shill because i'm saying real world performance and applications that you use is what is important
[991.22 --> 997.54]  when you shop for a product that is true that is true today it'll be true 10 years from now it was
[997.54 --> 1003.70]  true 10 years and 20 years ago and it has absolutely nothing to do with intel's marketing the problem is
[1003.70 --> 1009.86]  that intel is muddying the waters they're taking a benchmark like cinebench and they're saying well we
[1009.86 --> 1014.26]  should be putting less emphasis on this and we should be putting more emphasis on the applications that
[1014.26 --> 1021.06]  people are legitimately using every day the problem is that here we've got a slide from this great
[1021.06 --> 1027.06]  article over on videocards.com hold on where's this slide go and for video editing they're using
[1028.10 --> 1034.10]  magic's fast cut plus the is magic's fast cut plus and who the is using it
[1036.10 --> 1043.38]  how is that more real world than like you know cinema 4d which is an actual application that real
[1043.38 --> 1051.22]  actual professionals do use so people are drawing this false parallel between what i said which is
[1051.22 --> 1056.58]  that if you're going to shop for if all you ever do is play fortnite that's that's all you do you go
[1056.58 --> 1060.98]  to work you get home you turn on your computer you play fortnite you go to sleep you wake up in the
[1060.98 --> 1065.62]  morning you go to work rinse and repeat that's all you do then the only thing that matters to you when
[1065.62 --> 1071.86]  you choose a cpu is how many fps you get in fortnite that's it that's all that matters because that's what
[1071.86 --> 1076.82]  you actually do with your computer you shouldn't buy a processor based on how good it is at running
[1076.82 --> 1085.06]  cinebench or how good it is at running adobe premiere or whatever the case may be that is a 100 truth the
[1085.06 --> 1092.90]  issue is that intel is using that truth as a shield and then twisting the narrative around to applications
[1092.90 --> 1095.86]  that people don't necessarily use
[1099.62 --> 1104.74]  that was intense that was that was my rant i was just really upset by people when i was reading the
[1104.74 --> 1110.58]  comments on that video because a i'm being accused of being a paid shill when i'm not all we did is
[1110.58 --> 1115.70]  talk to people at intel who told gave us real information nothing to do with these dumb slides
[1115.70 --> 1121.22]  which i promise you we are going to get back to in a moment here and people not understanding the video
[1121.22 --> 1126.58]  it was a bit of a deeper dive video and i can see how some people who think they're very smart and very
[1126.58 --> 1132.66]  perceptive and oh i'm seeing through the bs on this actually just had no idea what i was talking about
[1132.66 --> 1137.54]  and defaulted to criticizing instead of just trying to actually understand what i was saying
[1137.54 --> 1142.50]  i can see how there might have been some of that but um you know there's just no excuse for it
[1142.50 --> 1146.34]  if you don't understand the video don't leave a comment there was nothing in that video that was wrong
[1146.34 --> 1152.90]  and i said nothing in that video that was uh that was an intel marketing point that wasn't just
[1152.90 --> 1158.98]  completely correct now let's get into the problems with intel's marketing that are making them look
[1158.98 --> 1167.38]  bad making me look bad and making their partners look bad okay i'm going back to display capture guys
[1167.38 --> 1173.54]  you can check out this full thing over on videocards.com it really is worth a looky-loo because
[1174.26 --> 1178.82]  there's some there's some just kind of shockingly frustrating stuff in here sorry i'm just going
[1178.82 --> 1187.30]  to give it a little resizey size here so you guys can get a good look here so all right market landscape
[1187.30 --> 1194.90]  blah blah blah now these slides were limited distribution not for end users but the reality of it is is if
[1194.90 --> 1200.98]  you're intel you're kind of a big voice and whenever you say something people sit up and take notice so you
[1200.98 --> 1206.18]  can't pretend that when you're saying something it's not going to eventually end up in front of
[1206.18 --> 1211.70]  the eyeballs of end users it's just the way that it works i'm sorry guys i don't make the rules we live
[1211.70 --> 1217.46]  in the information age yeah you got to deal with that um what do pc users actually do office applications
[1217.46 --> 1221.62]  games media consumption light content creation and game streaming and this seems to be color coded
[1221.62 --> 1227.22]  according to i don't know what this color coding is this is this is stupid these are stupid colors all right
[1227.22 --> 1234.18]  so chrome has a popularity of 63 i don't know why they would arbitrarily isolate chrome as web
[1234.18 --> 1238.58]  browsing i would say if you just said web browsing it would have a popularity of a hundred percent but
[1238.58 --> 1248.66]  you know whatever minor details uh word steam winrar yeah sure uh i mean oh man see okay okay we got we got
[1248.66 --> 1254.50]  some problems here like this is people making this slide that i feel like don't properly understand
[1254.50 --> 1261.22]  how people use their computers winrar might have a popularity of 37 percent in the sense that 37 percent
[1261.22 --> 1265.54]  of people have it or something similar installed on their computer when it comes to the percentage of
[1265.54 --> 1272.66]  time that i actually spend using winrar like what what fraction of a percent would that be for you luke
[1273.54 --> 1274.58]  i don't
[1276.66 --> 1282.82]  i haven't used okay i haven't used winrar in extremely long yeah i haven't used winrar specifically in a very
[1282.82 --> 1291.14]  long time but a a like application i would say like some tiny tiny decimal of a of a percentage
[1291.14 --> 1298.34]  sure yeah someone in chat said 0.00001 yeah yeah like once in a while when i download something that
[1298.34 --> 1304.34]  for whatever reason doesn't go straight into uh like a game launcher um all right so so winrar and
[1304.34 --> 1311.14]  you could make the argument that unzipping games is also like a winrar like application so i guess i do it
[1311.14 --> 1314.98]  a little more often than that point zero zero zero zero one percent or whatever uh but let's have a
[1314.98 --> 1320.82]  look at some of the other things that are showing up as popular popular uses uh obs at five percent
[1320.82 --> 1326.18]  i actually find that very hard to believe what what how are you getting i find all these that's the
[1326.18 --> 1330.90]  problem with these numbers is it's not like this is an invalid exercise figuring out what people
[1330.90 --> 1336.82]  actually do with their computers and then determining the value of your product compared to your competitor
[1336.82 --> 1341.54]  by looking at these things people actually do with their computers i just i just don't understand
[1342.18 --> 1350.50]  these numbers outlook is 17.6 when was the last time the cpu made a difference to outlook performance
[1351.06 --> 1358.50]  and and how do you how could you possibly say that obs has a five percent popularity what does that even mean
[1358.50 --> 1372.58]  i so i i think these slides are probably for people that are like the the product managers at at various
[1372.58 --> 1380.42]  companies and i think it is a little bit negatively manipulative for that reason but i don't it's probably
[1380.42 --> 1388.02]  not okay some of them like i'm extremely surprised 21.27 on vlc i was i was gonna that was my next one that
[1388.02 --> 1396.90]  was my next one there's no way there's just no way yeah um csgo is also written really weird there
[1396.90 --> 1401.38]  there's there's some stuff in here that's really weird but like being putting a thing up and being
[1401.38 --> 1407.22]  like look this is this is what most people use is not useless to a product manager that might be a little
[1407.22 --> 1414.10]  bit spaced but it's being misused i think absolutely these numbers feel very arbitrary so then we move on
[1414.10 --> 1420.66]  to some of the other slides here gaming uh the 9700k outperforms 3950x in popular games fair fair
[1420.66 --> 1428.10]  point um i don't know that i would say that far cry new dawn and far cry 5 are especially popular games
[1428.10 --> 1436.02]  right now in this moment um or almost any of these to be completely fair well world of shadow of war is
[1436.02 --> 1443.06]  kind of old game uh well there yeah it kind of is far cry new dawn is kind of old total warhammer 2
[1443.06 --> 1446.34]  total warhammer 2 that's that's actually current
[1448.66 --> 1454.10]  there's a bunch of these that people definitely play but like this is not if if we want to go back
[1454.10 --> 1460.34]  up to the what the pc users actually do uh graph if you try to apply that to these games they're going
[1460.34 --> 1466.66]  to be really low percentages yes uh okay so now let's talk frequency advantage drives intel's gaming
[1466.66 --> 1471.14]  leadership okay so like we and like some of these examples sorry to just jump back in yeah like world
[1471.14 --> 1481.38]  of tanks like yeah okay if you have a 9700k you're probably fine in world of tanks if you have a ryzen 9 3950x
[1481.94 --> 1487.30]  you're fine in world of tanks so like you're not yeah intel needs to get their story straight because
[1487.30 --> 1493.14]  they can say that you know oh yeah it's only applicable to a small percentage of users uh you
[1493.14 --> 1500.18]  know cinema 4d which they have on there as 0.54 or adobe premiere which they have on as 3.7 that's only
[1500.18 --> 1507.14]  applicable to a small percentage of users i would make the argument that an 11 to 18 fps improvement in
[1507.78 --> 1512.90]  most games is only applicable to competitive players who are a very small percentage of users
[1512.90 --> 1520.66]  um and a much better chart that they could have given is these are the applications uh this is the
[1520.66 --> 1526.10]  percentage of usage of these various applications that someone who's actually in the market for this
[1526.10 --> 1531.78]  processor will use not people that just use computers in general so they they want to kind
[1531.78 --> 1536.02]  of have their cake and eat it too or excuse me eat their cake and have it too i've been corrected on
[1536.02 --> 1540.34]  that it actually makes a lot more sense that way um so they want to say okay well these things aren't
[1540.34 --> 1545.54]  that important so we should like ignore them but also rah rah we've got this thing that i would make
[1545.54 --> 1555.14]  the argument that once you get beyond probably in the neighborhood of 75 to 120 or so fps it is a point
[1555.14 --> 1562.26]  of extremely diminishing returns for the vast majority of people i consider myself pretty sensitive to low
[1562.26 --> 1569.94]  fps like if there's a stutter or a frame rate dip i'm gonna feel it if i get down to 70 to 85 fps but beyond
[1569.94 --> 1576.34]  about 100 i usually can't tell especially if i'm using like um a refresh rate synchronization
[1576.34 --> 1583.54]  technology like g-sync or free sync okay moving on frequency drives intel's gaming leadership yes having
[1583.54 --> 1588.66]  higher frequency versus more cores is more important for gaming these days and there's a reason that they
[1588.66 --> 1594.66]  chose the 9700k specifically it's a six core processor and boosting up the frequency does tend to give you
[1594.66 --> 1599.94]  better return yeah that's fair uh hold on a second where's your power consumption slide i don't see
[1599.94 --> 1606.42]  one that's unfortunate anyway um cpu performance based on real world usage yes this is a cpu that
[1606.42 --> 1612.58]  costs half as much but amd could easily pick and choose their comparer points as well they could just
[1612.58 --> 1619.22]  as easily have taken intel's 9900ks special edition or you know 10 900k or whatever and compared it to
[1619.22 --> 1624.58]  something like a 3600 or 3600x and they would have also looked really good in terms of price
[1624.58 --> 1630.42]  performance you don't get to take your value gaming chip and put it up against someone else's flagship
[1630.42 --> 1634.98]  chip they should have put it up against a 3800x or something like that something that's at least
[1634.98 --> 1640.26]  remotely price comparable now we get on to the everyday workload slide like this whole thing just
[1640.90 --> 1647.22]  really annoys me so that's where we've got this stupid magix fast cut plus powered by intel quick sync
[1647.22 --> 1651.94]  video up to 2.7 times faster yeah that's the problem with quick sync video though is that
[1652.58 --> 1660.34]  the support for it is so limited that it's sort of a it's sort of a nothing burger like when you can
[1660.34 --> 1666.34]  find something that uses it it's awesome but the reality of it is that when it comes to video editing
[1666.34 --> 1672.74]  most people are not using that tool most people are using adobe creative cloud and if they can't afford
[1672.74 --> 1677.86]  adobe creative cloud they are either using davinci resolve or they are pirating adobe creative cloud
[1679.86 --> 1684.82]  look i don't make the rules luke like but that's yeah that's the way it is or they're on final cut
[1684.82 --> 1690.02]  because they're using a mac very few people are actually able to take advantage of that 2.7 times
[1690.02 --> 1696.02]  faster which is a very real advantage and when you use you know something like uh when you use it you
[1696.02 --> 1701.14]  know an actual dedicated encoding application and you can take advantage of that path it really is fast
[1701.14 --> 1708.90]  but gpus are also catching up so adobe in the latest beta of premiere and media encoder added support
[1708.90 --> 1716.18]  for cuda so it's now faster and supposedly without a quality drawback although we haven't actually tested
[1716.18 --> 1723.38]  that internally yet um but why you know why make the apples to apples comparison of the intel chip with
[1723.38 --> 1729.22]  nvidia encoding and the amd chip with nvidia encoding when you can pick and like cherry cherry pick this
[1729.22 --> 1736.58]  example where you get to be 2.7 times faster ah office productivity this is this is great eight
[1736.58 --> 1743.06]  percent better office productivity i mean like man we need the pepsi challenge back ladies and gentlemen
[1743.06 --> 1748.50]  do you think you could detect eight percent better uh powerpoint this productivity no powerpoint
[1748.50 --> 1756.26]  performance in a blind taste test nope i would like to say that i could i would like to say that i am that
[1756.26 --> 1761.94]  sensitive towards performance improvements but uh in productivity suites i'm not going to notice it
[1762.50 --> 1768.90]  i might be able to potentially at certain levels of performance within gaming but not office
[1768.90 --> 1774.74]  productivity which isn't to say that there's anything necessarily wrong with pointing out that
[1774.74 --> 1781.30]  in sysmark 2018 you have up to seven percent better scores compared to your competitor that cost twice as
[1781.30 --> 1788.18]  much there's nothing inherently wrong with saying hey well you know yeah seven percent might not be a
[1788.18 --> 1793.94]  big deal but hey seven percent is better than a kick in the teeth ain't it it's just that they didn't
[1793.94 --> 1803.14]  manage to find any application where amd outperformed them even though those things do exist so and and the
[1803.14 --> 1811.46]  thing is when when you have a list of charts like this where like you you start with that one that's
[1811.46 --> 1818.58]  just brutal of like the which we need to get back to still the the like no numbers on either side of the
[1818.58 --> 1824.26]  graph amd is listed as base up to whatever percentage we use a different graphics card all this other kind
[1824.26 --> 1831.14]  of stuff every single other slide after that what the heck every single slide after that becomes highly
[1831.14 --> 1837.22]  questionable and now now we're going to look at things like the the the small amount of desktop
[1837.22 --> 1843.30]  uh sorry not desktop uh productivity suite performance increase which normally we would just scroll
[1843.30 --> 1848.50]  over that slide and be like yeah whatever i don't really care it doesn't matter and move forward um
[1849.62 --> 1855.22]  but but now it we want to call it out because we want to call everything out just you can avoid
[1855.22 --> 1863.46]  these problems by just not being fishy in the first place yeah here's a really weird one like when
[1863.46 --> 1869.70]  okay you know what i'm i'm not going to go too hard at this next slide because uh based on the timing i
[1869.70 --> 1876.10]  think that um amd's zen 2 value processors might not have been out yet so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
[1876.10 --> 1882.82]  slam them for this uh intel really did deliver a better gaming experience on the low end uh before amd was
[1882.82 --> 1892.50]  uh had zen 2 uh chips available so the ryzen 3100 and 3300 those are those are killer um the 3400g really
[1892.50 --> 1896.26]  was probably not worth settling for for gaming so i'm not going to go after them for that so let's go
[1896.26 --> 1902.10]  back to that one slide that you had wanted to talk about uh which one was the one you wanted one quick
[1902.10 --> 1908.50]  thing before we go back yeah um if you look at the very next slide after everyday workloads yep elite
[1909.14 --> 1913.62]  real world performance for gaming and creating yeah this is all versus their last gen i think
[1914.34 --> 1920.34]  you also notice what they included hold on a second can i have a look here wait why is video editing in
[1920.34 --> 1925.30]  here oh gaming and creating okay sure fine versus three okay they just pick and choose what they're
[1925.30 --> 1933.38]  comparing against okay look at the video editing application that is used oh no what what is it i can't
[1933.38 --> 1941.14]  even tell premiere wait what now they use premiere they have the logo right there pr oh there it is
[1941.14 --> 1948.26]  oh you gotta be kidding me that is ridiculous okay i you know what that's really ridiculous you're right
[1948.26 --> 1952.98]  you're right but i'm gonna i'm gonna move on to more cherry picking here and they just seem to have
[1952.98 --> 1959.38]  seemingly arbitrarily chosen what they want to compare against here the games hold on a second uh let me just
[1959.38 --> 1966.18]  let me just move this elite real world performance here we go so up to 33 percent more uh whatever this
[1966.18 --> 1974.10]  is is this what is this gaming uh more fps versus their own previous gen okay up to 81 percent more
[1974.10 --> 1983.78]  versus three-year-old pc uh okay up to 187 fps what does that what does that even mean up to 2x better mega
[1983.78 --> 1990.02]  tasking what am i like what am i even okay three year old pc never mind i i only saw that over here
[1990.02 --> 1994.66]  that's okay previous gen okay okay all right all right so these are all internal comparisons against
[1994.66 --> 1998.90]  their own stuff so that's fine i'm less mad about that but still the percentage stuff i'm not too worried
[1998.90 --> 2006.58]  about it's just the fact that they they they cherry picked their example that no one uses previously
[2006.58 --> 2011.86]  yeah video editing and then they went and they used premiere when it mattered yeah and they're like well we know
[2011.86 --> 2016.66]  we know we know this one's the actually important one so we're going to include it in this later slide
[2016.66 --> 2023.62]  and just hope nobody notices so here's the bottom line real world performance matters intel is not
[2024.66 --> 2034.10]  wrong in that sense the thing that is wrong is taking someone else's benchmark that you feel is not
[2034.10 --> 2041.54]  real world representative enough and substituting your own equally not representative of the real world
[2042.02 --> 2047.94]  benchmark okay when i said in that video i'm going back to the comments on that techquickie video again
[2047.94 --> 2056.02]  when i said in that video that real world performance is what matters that is like an age-old wisdom that
[2056.02 --> 2064.26]  comes from back when cpu reviews used to contain almost nothing but the following stupid meaningless
[2064.26 --> 2070.66]  arbitrary synthetic benchmarks like psysoft sandra which just measures things like millions of instructions per
[2070.66 --> 2078.10]  seconds which doesn't necessarily translate to the real world okay so a purely synthetic benchmark it
[2078.10 --> 2086.58]  would also contain things like um oh yes right synthetic gaming benchmarks like 3d mark 2001 or whatever
[2086.58 --> 2093.62]  back then the tools to to measure the fps of real games were much more rudimentary very very difficult to
[2093.62 --> 2098.98]  use if you could get anything working at all um and and you couldn't get the same amount of like detail you
[2098.98 --> 2102.18]  know frame times and stuff like that we didn't have tools for measuring it so you'd get these
[2102.18 --> 2107.86]  synthetic games that ultimately could be meaningless you could have one cpu that performs twice as good
[2107.86 --> 2113.38]  in you know 3d mark and then half as well in an actual game that people are actually playing so that's why
[2113.38 --> 2118.18]  that was important getting away from synthetic game benchmarks and then the other thing that you'd have
[2118.18 --> 2122.42]  was uh oh what was the other one that i had wanted to point out right yeah totally unrealistic
[2122.42 --> 2132.26]  real world gaming applications like people would run you know quake 3 at 640 by 480 uh just to show you
[2132.26 --> 2140.02]  know what the maximum fps that a cpu could drive was when you remove the gpu as a bottleneck and there is
[2140.02 --> 2146.26]  still some validity particularly to that last one because it does tell you okay when you remove the gpu as
[2146.26 --> 2151.46]  a bottleneck how many fps can you get so it's like turning a game all the way down to low settings and saying
[2151.46 --> 2159.54]  which one at the at the the end of the day is the better like gaming cpu um so you're trying to
[2159.54 --> 2164.98]  effectively like extrapolate to when games get more demanding you know which one is going to keep up
[2164.98 --> 2173.38]  for longer um but that doesn't inform how the user is actually going to use the computer none of those
[2173.38 --> 2179.62]  things do and that's why there was a big shift to real world benchmarks and whether intel likes it or not
[2179.62 --> 2185.14]  cinema 4d is a real world application that real people do actually use even if it's very few of
[2185.14 --> 2191.06]  them and one of the nice things about it for a reviewer is that it tends to give us a really quick
[2191.06 --> 2198.66]  look at you know what to expect in an application that scales really well across multiple cores so it's
[2198.66 --> 2206.26]  not synthetic and if you don't like you know cinema 4d or cinebench or whatever you could say that you
[2206.26 --> 2210.42]  could say that specific benchmark we don't feel is applicable to many people and i and they have
[2210.42 --> 2215.78]  said that but you don't get to then pick your own random benchmarks or real world applications that
[2215.78 --> 2222.50]  nobody uses and substitute those that is my point and that all is all i have to say about it now intel
[2222.50 --> 2228.74]  stop embarrassing yourself and stop embarrassing me because i have the you know poor sense to talk to
[2228.74 --> 2234.10]  you about something as basic as you know what a die shrink means and then have people jump down my throat
[2234.10 --> 2238.82]  because they think that what i'm saying is somehow part of your dumb benchmarking
[2241.30 --> 2246.50]  i'm calm now you want to talk about dr disrespect getting banned from twitch
[2248.34 --> 2253.14]  wait luke i can't hear you i can't hear you luke right sorry there's people cheering outside my window
[2253.14 --> 2258.74]  so i need him i'm like uh maybe talk to shroud about how you should present some of this stuff before you
[2258.74 --> 2264.18]  present some of the stuff and stop assuming that just because you put a usage guideline limited
[2264.18 --> 2268.90]  distribution not suitable for end user messaging that it's not going to leak all of these things
[2268.90 --> 2273.54]  and besides if it's not suitable for if it's not suitable for end user messaging it's not suitable for
[2273.54 --> 2279.22]  partner messaging you just shouldn't be saying it if you wouldn't say it to a customer if it could be
[2279.22 --> 2284.66]  considered misleading to say to a customer you should never say it to anyone that's that should be your
[2284.66 --> 2288.58]  rule and i thought you were talking to me when you're like talk to shroud i'm like why do i have
[2288.58 --> 2293.94]  to talk to shroud i i don't need to talk to shroud i know i know shroud shroud knows this stuff so we're
[2293.94 --> 2298.82]  talking about ryan shroud who used to run pc perspective and is now at intel like that's all
[2298.82 --> 2304.82]  these guys have to do talk to shroud because he would be able to look at that that slide deck and say
[2304.82 --> 2311.46]  whoa we cannot show this to anybody all right let's talk about dr disrespect getting banned from twitch
[2311.46 --> 2318.82]  so i have no idea if these two things are related but there has been uh a sort of resurgence in the
[2318.82 --> 2326.82]  hashtag me too movement this time uh quite laser focused on twitch we don't technically know that
[2326.82 --> 2335.70]  this one is in line with that i don't personally seen any public anything yet about it that has nothing
[2335.70 --> 2340.74]  no real information what we could be we have no idea what we do know and the reason that i was
[2340.74 --> 2345.62]  tying those things together is not because i think i i don't remember his real name unfortunately but
[2345.62 --> 2351.62]  uh not because i think that uh loop loop something is it you know it doesn't matter uh not because i
[2351.62 --> 2356.98]  think that um these things are necessarily directly related or that he was involved in any kind of sexual
[2356.98 --> 2362.90]  misconduct i have no idea i don't know the guy but um what i think it could be related to is
[2363.78 --> 2369.54]  platforms like twitch suddenly realizing and i don't know why it took this long that they really
[2369.54 --> 2376.10]  need to take some responsibility for the people that they partner with because that's what the meaning
[2376.10 --> 2384.74]  of the word partner is when you're a twitch partner you are you are partnered and whether you know whether
[2384.74 --> 2390.90]  you know you're amazon and you put in your contract that uh you know i cannot in any way um
[2390.90 --> 2396.90]  uh imply that i am associated with amazon or affiliated affiliated that's the word because
[2396.90 --> 2402.58]  it used to be called amazon affiliate and they changed it to amazon associates so uh in the contract
[2402.58 --> 2408.74]  it says that i can't say that i'm affiliated with amazon formally in any way um but you actually still go
[2408.74 --> 2414.66]  to affiliate-amazon.com or whatever it is to access the amazon associates program so whenever you have a
[2414.66 --> 2420.58]  word like affiliate i think that's why amazon got rid of it or partner you create this perception that
[2420.58 --> 2427.14]  you are you know working together and they are they're they're giving money to this this individual
[2427.14 --> 2431.86]  or these individuals and these individuals are creating content for their platform it is a
[2431.86 --> 2438.82]  partnership it's a symbiotic partnership and i think what twitch is realizing as part of this me too
[2438.82 --> 2444.26]  moment that is happening on twitch right now where everyone from prominent streamers to partner
[2444.26 --> 2453.06]  managers is being accused of impropriety right now is that holy crap it actually reflects on us when our
[2453.06 --> 2464.74]  partners do stuff that is terrible so i don't know ultimately what dr disrespect did part of his character is
[2464.74 --> 2472.50]  being disrespectful and he has definitely done stuff that i think um you know if he were employed at
[2472.50 --> 2478.18]  more of a conventional media organization like a like a news outlet for example would have gotten him
[2478.18 --> 2483.86]  absolutely fired and completely unhirable ever again like that incident where he live streamed in a
[2483.86 --> 2491.38]  public bathroom um so i don't know exactly what he did i suspect that it's just well even if it's not
[2491.38 --> 2497.62]  directly related to what's going on right now with hashtag me too over on twitch it is probably
[2497.62 --> 2507.78]  related to some kind of thing that i find believable that he might have done um and they they probably
[2507.78 --> 2513.62]  just want to create some distance now i have a bit of a tinfoil hat theory but i'm gonna wait until
[2513.62 --> 2520.82]  uh you see if luke has sort of two cents to chime in here first tinfoil hat theory is coming though um i i have
[2521.62 --> 2526.58]  heard a bunch of different ideas on this and and as far as i know there's no there's no publicly i
[2526.58 --> 2532.58]  can't wait asserted ones that are solved the one i don't watch his stream i don't really watch twitch
[2532.58 --> 2537.06]  streams in general every once in a while i jump on summit stream because i find his gta rp stuff really
[2537.06 --> 2543.70]  entertaining sure and i like it when you play cfz um but i'm not really a twitch viewer but uh there's
[2543.70 --> 2552.82]  apparently some potential theories that it could be a um what is it ftc violation due to some
[2552.82 --> 2559.62]  undisclosed sponsorships oh that seems no i don't know you know what that doesn't make sense to me
[2559.62 --> 2567.78]  though because my understanding of those guidelines is that ultimately they fall back on the individual or
[2567.78 --> 2572.82]  excuse me on the brand not on the individual themselves now i haven't looked at the guidelines
[2572.82 --> 2577.38]  lately because for us it's a lot easier to just make sure that our disclosures are all in line
[2577.94 --> 2583.38]  um than to you know figure out what the consequences are but when i went back through this a while ago
[2583.38 --> 2588.90]  someone submitted a complaint to some kind of canadian regulatory body that uh we weren't disclosing
[2588.90 --> 2596.58]  sponsorships um so i went through and i i really immersed myself in the in the in the um in the
[2596.58 --> 2601.62]  documentation for this stuff i went through both the american and canadian ones because i'm canadian
[2601.62 --> 2605.94]  and a lot of our partners are american i felt like i needed to understand it on both sides of the border
[2605.94 --> 2612.74]  and we ultimately were uh found by the canadian organization to have not been um in violation of
[2612.74 --> 2618.18]  anything of any of their standards uh because they accused us of not disclosing a sponsorship but i
[2618.18 --> 2622.82]  was like this video that they flagged here we disclosed the sponsorship literally three times
[2622.82 --> 2627.70]  once verbally uh again in text and then a third time verbally it's like what are you talking about
[2627.70 --> 2633.70]  um anyway the point is the last time i looked at it my understanding was that when there was a
[2633.70 --> 2640.18]  violation it ultimately reflected on the brand that was paying not on the influencer themselves so
[2640.18 --> 2647.30]  there was sort of a really um sort of wild west era there anywhere from probably three to ten years ago
[2647.30 --> 2652.98]  where what was happening was brands did not properly understand these guidelines slash they didn't
[2652.98 --> 2659.54]  exist yet and influencers didn't care because ultimately nothing bad could happen to them so
[2659.54 --> 2665.62]  there were a lot of undisclosed sponsorships going around well here's the problem brands started to
[2665.62 --> 2672.58]  wise up when i think it what what was it uh xbox got in trouble when they had a bunch of like undisclosed uh
[2672.58 --> 2677.14]  partnerships around the xbox one launch they had people playing games and not disclosing that they
[2677.14 --> 2683.30]  were sponsored by microsoft you remember that luke uh yes i think that was sort of like a watershed
[2683.30 --> 2687.46]  moment for all of this when everyone kind of woke up and went oh it's actually microsoft that they're
[2687.46 --> 2694.10]  going to go after so it is very typical now for non-shady companies to have really really strict
[2694.10 --> 2699.94]  guidelines in their partner contracts about how you have to disclose and it's all in line with the ftc now
[2699.94 --> 2705.30]  there's there's lots of companies that don't bother or don't understand it or think they're just going
[2705.30 --> 2712.74]  to skirt around it and i have seen still even now like even as as recently as this year and last year
[2712.74 --> 2721.22]  um some videos go up that i know for a fact are are sponsored because like you know i worked on a video
[2721.22 --> 2727.70]  with the brand at around that same time with similar a similar spin on it similar messaging but for whatever
[2727.70 --> 2733.06]  reason mine is disclosed and the other person's isn't um or ones where i know from talking to the
[2733.06 --> 2736.58]  brand like who they're working with and i see the video go up and i'm like oh yeah that's uh
[2738.26 --> 2742.82]  not disclosed that's interesting um so it's definitely still happening but it's not
[2742.82 --> 2750.98]  nearly as prevalent as it was even two three years ago um so yeah can i can i go tinfoil hat for a second
[2750.98 --> 2759.62]  here yeah okay i think that it could be any reason i think it could be some kind of accusation i think
[2759.62 --> 2763.46]  it could be uh whatever the thing you said that sounded credible was some kind of undisclosed
[2763.46 --> 2770.42]  sponsorship thing i think it could be that i think that um he's probably done enough things that are
[2770.42 --> 2776.58]  bannable at this point that um there was some theory there was some theory in the past that he would
[2776.58 --> 2782.74]  intentionally get himself in trouble uh sure yep trying to get temp bans and stuff like that because
[2782.74 --> 2787.62]  it really actually lined up quite well with his character yeah with his brand and it gets him a
[2787.62 --> 2794.10]  bunch of press okay so whatever the reason is part of me kind of goes you know what maybe it actually
[2794.10 --> 2800.58]  doesn't matter maybe what twitch is realizing is like i said before they have a responsibility to their
[2800.58 --> 2806.34]  brand to associate or partner with people who are going to reflect on it positively and maybe
[2806.34 --> 2811.46]  they're having a little bit of buyer's remorse about that exclusivity deal that they signed with
[2811.46 --> 2821.14]  them and at this point the cost of not having him on the platform is less than the cost of paying him
[2821.14 --> 2823.46]  not to go to a platform that no longer exists
[2825.86 --> 2834.10]  because they just paid him reportedly an enormous sum of money millions and millions of dollars to not go
[2834.10 --> 2838.18]  over to mixer because realistically nobody was going over to facebook gaming if any of the scuttlebutt is
[2838.18 --> 2845.62]  to be believed um both ninja and shroud were offered significantly more than their existing mixer contracts
[2845.62 --> 2851.22]  to make the migration over to facebook gaming and didn't do it because nobody with a brand to protect
[2851.22 --> 2858.10]  right now wants it associated with facebook in any way outside of like the normie sphere like if if you
[2858.10 --> 2864.18]  have like a tech savvy or like a media savvy audience you do not want any association with facebook i mean
[2864.18 --> 2873.14]  aren't they going through like a corporate um a boycott right now i think i saw that uh oh who was it
[2873.14 --> 2879.22]  unilever just uh just boycotted advertising on facebook or something like that don't know there's been a lot of pullouts
[2879.22 --> 2888.18]  um let me just double check make sure uh and yeah yeah unilever uh pulled out of both facebook and uh
[2888.18 --> 2895.54]  a twitter i believe verizon pledged to uh pull ads from facebook so like that is a super toxic brand so
[2895.54 --> 2900.82]  realistically the only thing left is youtube gaming and if i'm youtube gaming i'm not going to be signing
[2900.82 --> 2906.50]  any like gigantic uh gigantic deals right now i'm just going to let this toxicity on twitch play out and
[2906.50 --> 2910.74]  i'm going to sit there and go oh thank goodness i'm not in the news right now this is wonderful
[2913.70 --> 2921.46]  so i kind of wonder if part of the timing is you know hey this guy was already toxic um now that
[2921.46 --> 2927.06]  we've made this big splash partnering with him it reflects on us even more uh and i wonder if they
[2927.06 --> 2932.42]  were just waiting for him to do something bannable that simple and save themselves some money
[2932.42 --> 2939.70]  yep they they very recently signed a i don't have the exact date or the exact value on this
[2939.70 --> 2946.66]  uh but they very recently i think it was within the last two years signed a very large yeah it was so
[2946.66 --> 2952.10]  when when all those streamers are being poached by mixer they signed a big exclusivity contract with him
[2952.10 --> 2961.94]  so it still sounds a little bit surprising um that they dropped him you know yeah um it's a huge deal
[2961.94 --> 2966.74]  and i mean the thing is like i think at the end of the day the doc is probably going to be okay
[2967.70 --> 2976.58]  but getting de-platformed is extremely traumatic like i can i can probably count on my hands and toes
[2976.58 --> 2985.78]  or my fingers and toes the number of people that um have six not just successfully but have but
[2985.78 --> 2990.82]  that have thrived moving from one platform over to another um
[2993.30 --> 2999.06]  yeah what's yeah sometimes sometimes it works okay when you continue on the previous platform um
[2999.06 --> 3007.38]  um but fully switching is is often not super fantastic yeah um as as we saw in a topic we're
[3007.38 --> 3013.62]  going to be going into with uh with ninja and shroud moving over to mixer oh yeah uh let's get through

[3224.58 --> 3228.74]  all right back to linus and luke talking about crazy stuff going on can you intro our next topic
[3228.74 --> 3236.34]  yes man everything is a mixer one yeah let's talk through that why don't we microsoft axes mixer i
[3236.34 --> 3245.38]  actually said what to my display when i read this i i could not contain it to nobody barely use twitter
[3245.38 --> 3252.58]  anymore um ever i i'm not super active on social media these days um but i just blew up when this
[3252.58 --> 3258.98]  happened because it's a like especially being sort of in the space it's it's kind of it's huge amazing
[3259.46 --> 3266.26]  it's it's massive it's it's not that often you see a platform like this just gone just gone um but
[3266.26 --> 3275.62]  yeah acquired yes gone no like bizarre uh yeah uh oh okay i thought you were saying that was what
[3275.62 --> 3281.70]  happened no no no no i just mean like to be acquired is like like normally you expect yeah you know these
[3281.70 --> 3287.46]  these platforms to just kind of you know oh yeah i'll acquire yahoo acquired it and you're like what
[3287.46 --> 3291.46]  does yahoo even own like what does yahoo even do you know like that kind of thing you expect that
[3291.46 --> 3296.98]  but just gone they acquire things and then let them die yeah exactly this one just died on its
[3296.98 --> 3304.58]  own though uh all mixer sites and apps will redirect users to facebook gaming that's crazy um which i
[3304.58 --> 3309.62]  i think we're gonna have to come back to that in a moment during the current controversy holy cow the
[3309.62 --> 3314.50]  the fact that they decided to do that was nuts uh the company stated in a blog post on june 22nd
[3314.50 --> 3320.82]  blindsiding definitely talk to a few people from that platform definitely blindsiding streamers
[3320.82 --> 3326.02]  employees and their partners the move microsoft said is in direct reaction to the company's lack
[3326.02 --> 3333.14]  of success with with uh uh growth in the mixer audience overall on the platform there is if you
[3333.14 --> 3340.50]  watch like uh shroud or ninja on that platform they will have a lot of viewers the issue is the platform
[3340.50 --> 3347.22]  as a whole viewership has not really gone up and i really do mean that because it seems like the
[3347.22 --> 3353.94]  viewers from other streams just went to shroud and ninja yeah it doesn't really seem that more people
[3353.94 --> 3358.90]  came to mixer don't quote me on this but i was reading an article that said that in the same time
[3358.90 --> 3365.38]  period mixer grew by like one percent and facebook gaming had doubled or something like that yeah i mean
[3365.38 --> 3370.98]  if you click on the the blue text that says stats you should be able to scroll down and see year
[3370.98 --> 3377.86]  over year growth that's a very interesting chart and it very accurately displays the issue um where
[3377.86 --> 3385.14]  there was a 0.2 year of a year growth for mixer there we go 38 year of a year growth for facebook gaming
[3385.14 --> 3392.90]  65 for youtube gaming and almost exactly a hundred percent for twitch there was no there was effectively no
[3392.90 --> 3400.66]  growth from mixer um and they had the the highest like opportunity to grow um being at a smaller
[3400.66 --> 3406.10]  number and bringing in these massive streamers and they didn't see any growth um streamers were locked
[3406.10 --> 3413.14]  into exclusivity deals with mixer and they were fully released from their contracts so ninja and shroud
[3413.14 --> 3419.78]  and i believe others were fully released from their contracts ninja's deal was estimated at 20 to 30
[3419.78 --> 3425.86]  million dollars and he's been fully released from his contract uh facebook apparently offered them
[3426.42 --> 3433.06]  wild amounts of money i don't have exact some people were talking about potentially 2x the original
[3433.06 --> 3440.98]  contract amounts um and neither as far as i know neither shroud nor ninja have publicly stated what
[3440.98 --> 3445.38]  they are going to be doing moving forward i mean i would i would for 60 million dollars i would
[3445.38 --> 3451.30]  definitely be thinking about it at least i i i look look you know what you can facebook very bad
[3451.86 --> 3456.66]  very very bad on the record very bad here i am so clearly they're never going to make me an offer
[3456.66 --> 3462.50]  at this point and then if i keep burning bridges like this but uh man for like 50 million bucks
[3463.30 --> 3469.06]  uh man i i would at least have to think about it you know if they offered me 40 million dollars like i
[3469.06 --> 3474.74]  would definitely i would definitely have to at least talk to the wife you know like if facebook called up and
[3474.74 --> 3480.34]  they were like look i'll give you 30 million dollars to stream on facebook gaming it's it's worth it's
[3480.34 --> 3486.66]  worth considering okay okay okay hypothetical scenario they offer 20 million dollars i just keep going down
[3488.34 --> 3491.06]  you have to at least think about it this is set for life money
[3492.66 --> 3499.94]  40 million dollars but you had to cease all activity on all other platforms i wouldn't do it right
[3499.94 --> 3507.06]  yeah i wouldn't okay okay let's let's just go let's just say uh flow plane and youtube because those
[3507.06 --> 3511.06]  are the other only other because like twitter and instagram is not the same level of video
[3512.42 --> 3518.98]  i have to stop no there's no way i'm a youtuber like for better or for worse um i kind of i kind of
[3518.98 --> 3525.94]  live or die by that sword um you know if if youtube dies that's you know i would probably just i'd
[3525.94 --> 3533.70]  probably just hang up my screwdriver uh you know like honestly like i think i like the statement i
[3533.70 --> 3538.74]  i would i would keep like i would probably keep creating some content but it would be something
[3538.74 --> 3546.18]  that i would do as a hobby as opposed to uh my profession i think is very likely right yeah i think
[3546.18 --> 3552.02]  the things that you found interesting like i could see myself legitimately in like a semi-retirement
[3552.02 --> 3555.94]  where i'm still on something like float plane and i'm still on twitter and just like you know
[3555.94 --> 3561.54]  tweeting random thoughts and i'm still like you know live streaming just playing video games um
[3562.50 --> 3567.86]  to like that audience in particular is really fun to engage with uh you know i could i could see
[3567.86 --> 3572.34]  myself doing that because it would it would be justifiable because these are paying these are
[3572.34 --> 3579.38]  effectively paying customers that want to engage with you and um yeah you know it's it's way better
[3579.38 --> 3584.42]  you know use of time compared to you know ad supported platforms so in that sense like i could
[3584.42 --> 3589.62]  i could definitely justify taking the time to do something like that but if i was effectively like
[3589.62 --> 3596.42]  de-platformed like where i do most of my volume business as opposed to like my high profit business
[3596.42 --> 3602.50]  i i just i don't think i'd want to pick up the pieces again it's demoralizing even if i could do it
[3602.50 --> 3608.66]  and i think i could do it i think i'm a i think i'm a very good you know online personality um i think
[3608.66 --> 3612.42]  that's fair to say at this point i think if i wanted to make it as a game streamer i could make
[3612.42 --> 3620.10]  that work or whatever um but it would just be it would be borderline depressing to have to start over
[3622.02 --> 3628.90]  yeah i i could definitely see that um i don't know if that's what you're asking that is and i want to
[3628.90 --> 3634.90]  jump back on that quick i just want to finish the notes here facebook is offering 2500 signing bonus
[3634.90 --> 3639.54]  two mixer partners and it was much easier to become a mixer partner than it was a twitch partner
[3639.54 --> 3646.58]  um who they're offering that 2500 if they join uh the facebook gaming creator program and stay for 90
[3646.58 --> 3651.54]  days along with fulfilling obligations which is probably like minimum streaming times and days
[3651.54 --> 3660.50]  etc um now what do you think let's focus on what everybody's focusing on which is which is ninja and
[3660.50 --> 3666.74]  shroud what do you think they will do and you can answer uh individually if you want i think they're
[3666.74 --> 3671.70]  going to end up going back to twitch i think that they are going to go back to twitch with uh less
[3671.70 --> 3677.30]  lucrative deals but i think twitch is in a position where again talking about you know de-platforming
[3677.30 --> 3682.50]  so they de-platformed from you think after after getting potentially 30 million dollars
[3684.10 --> 3689.70]  as a signing bonus than just being able to walk away that ninja is going to in a certain way crawl back to
[3689.70 --> 3697.06]  twitch and take a worse contract what are his other options he could just quit he could stream
[3697.06 --> 3703.22]  wherever he wants he could go to youtube i he is at this point he has spoken out against twitch
[3703.22 --> 3710.02]  specifically and they trashed his channel after he left do you remember that that's true no i had
[3710.02 --> 3715.70]  actually forgotten about that i did know that they weren't going to accept them back with open arms i do
[3715.70 --> 3724.42]  know that yeah like like ninja had to specifically call out twitch for abusing his channel um and there
[3724.42 --> 3733.06]  was uh there was there was some very odd content posted on his stream i don't remember exactly what it was
[3733.70 --> 3740.50]  um but but they they posted stuff on his page that he was very not okay with um
[3740.50 --> 3744.82]  youtube chats like only fans
[3748.66 --> 3754.82]  oh man you know what is the man what is the answer because nothing beats the discoverability
[3754.82 --> 3759.46]  well okay they have terrible discoverability but once you're big nothing beats the discoverability of
[3759.46 --> 3764.26]  twitch if you're a game streamer period um if you don't want to get in bed with facebook which i could
[3764.26 --> 3771.30]  understand not wanting to do you can't go there youtube gaming like like so shroud yeah honestly i
[3771.30 --> 3777.70]  wouldn't be too surprised if he went back to twitch uh i feel like his his cut from twitch was much cleaner
[3780.18 --> 3787.06]  yeah for sure um and i don't remember much public at least major fighting between them ninja's
[3787.06 --> 3802.10]  um the twitch as a whole streamed some stuff on his page that he was extremely not okay with i don't
[3802.10 --> 3809.06]  want to say the word for what it was because it might uh flag this video um but like and and he he
[3809.06 --> 3816.02]  he posted a whole video uh essentially if we want to use like civilization terms uh he denounced
[3816.58 --> 3820.02]  twitch in a certain way like like we've been playing sim lately
[3821.86 --> 3827.94]  um moving down to why do they keep denouncing me they just have more i just have more great people than
[3827.94 --> 3837.14]  them um but uh i guess in this situation actually um but yeah i i think it would be a very interesting
[3837.14 --> 3842.90]  move if he went back to twitch and i think it would definitely take some explanation due to the
[3842.90 --> 3848.66]  fighting that has happened in the past um and i think it would take both sides kind of coming together
[3848.66 --> 3853.86]  and trying to wipe the slate clean i do not think it would just be ninja crawling back i think it would
[3853.86 --> 3860.74]  be both sides trying to uh split their differences and try to move forward if he goes back to twitch i
[3860.74 --> 3867.06]  honestly wouldn't be too surprised if he maybe went to youtube my reasoning for that is facebook
[3867.06 --> 3871.30]  super controversial right now yeah i would be very surprised if either of them went to facebook
[3871.78 --> 3879.86]  um twitch for ninja is rather controversial right now i wouldn't be stunned but i'd be a little bit
[3879.86 --> 3886.82]  surprised if if they made that work again but youtube is kind of this neutral zone um it also doesn't go
[3886.82 --> 3891.14]  in line with the the statements he was making when he first moved to mixer which is that he could maybe
[3891.14 --> 3896.58]  uh help guide and direct the direction there and have a bigger voice yeah having a bigger voice i think
[3896.58 --> 3901.30]  you'll have no voice at youtube basically yeah they don't really seem to care i was actually
[3901.94 --> 3906.66]  decently surprised that the youtube gaming numbers were as high as they were on that stats page
[3907.30 --> 3912.34]  i even killed the dedicated app last year it killed the dedicated app and when's the last time they said
[3912.34 --> 3918.18]  anything about youtube gaming they're just lucky i guess and just it just carries from the the youtube
[3918.18 --> 3925.30]  name as a whole so yes and no i mean there's there's no luck to how good youtube is at live video
[3925.30 --> 3932.50]  delivery and vaude video delivery like good engineering at some point is valuable yeah the dashboard is horrible
[3932.98 --> 3939.70]  um the actual usability of youtube live is terrible um i mean i know how to use it now it's okay
[3941.62 --> 3945.06]  yeah but it's not a good selling intuitive miss and
[3946.58 --> 3952.58]  ease of use is probably close to worth and worst in the industry um i'm sure they'll figure it out because
[3952.58 --> 3957.70]  they're youtube but right now it's very bad so like i i just losing his voice almost completely
[3957.70 --> 3962.02]  all these other things would be a surprising i don't know everything from him i think is just
[3962.02 --> 3966.98]  going to be a surprising move because like the the youtube move is so against the reason why he went to
[3966.98 --> 3975.54]  mixer yeah and the twitch move is so against everything as far as i know that he said about twitch since he
[3975.54 --> 3984.42]  left so you know what i mean you know 20 or 30 million or let's say it's even just 10 million
[3984.42 --> 3989.78]  dollars that really is set for life money um maybe they just stream as a hobby and it actually doesn't
[3989.78 --> 3994.02]  really matter where they go you know what i'm i'm here okay fine fine with all the extra information
[3994.02 --> 3999.78]  you've given me you've made it easier i think uh i think ninja stays on youtube i think shroud makes a
[3999.78 --> 4006.58]  triumphant return back to twitch there because i mean ninja's got like 20 million subscribers on
[4006.58 --> 4011.94]  youtube it's not like he's like starting over there he's really big on youtube yeah he would do super
[4011.94 --> 4019.86]  well he always had massive fortnite clips yeah um he would do super well on youtube for sure and he he was
[4019.86 --> 4027.30]  one of the twitch people who always talked about their youtube audience as well and like like youtube felt
[4027.30 --> 4035.62]  like a like a side thing sure in in the story instead of a uh weird underlying platform like it
[4035.62 --> 4040.10]  was it was a platform that he definitely cared a lot about i'm gonna say neither of them gets a
[4040.10 --> 4047.38]  sweetheart deal to go anywhere though at this point uh except for facebook but well apparently they've
[4047.38 --> 4055.94]  both publicly turned it down yeah so but they still got the deal well yeah yeah uh what who knows if it's
[4055.94 --> 4060.82]  him or not but uh whoever manages his youtube channel has uploaded a video there as recently as
[4060.82 --> 4066.10]  seven hours ago yep and that wasn't like oh geez we have to keep this going there's there's videos
[4066.10 --> 4076.26]  going up there all the time they could come to floatplane just saying we've uh i had someone in chat
[4076.26 --> 4083.78]  actually ask uh this is a super chat uh over on youtube could floatplane support um those kinds of
[4083.78 --> 4092.58]  viewers um the answer is yes but with a big asterisk so right now the way it's architected we could
[4092.58 --> 4098.98]  support a nearly unlimited number of concurrent viewers but not a nearly unlimited number of
[4098.98 --> 4106.66]  concurrent streamers so if like one of them on top of that as well but yeah yeah if if one of them
[4106.66 --> 4112.90]  showed up we could probably make it work just like you know all three of these guys knocked on our door
[4112.90 --> 4119.14]  and we're like hey we'd have to we'd have to real quick fast duct tape engineer some stuff and it
[4119.14 --> 4123.70]  might not be smooth probably wouldn't go that well probably we could try though probably wouldn't be
[4123.70 --> 4129.54]  smooth well we could like we'll give it a baseball try we could manually no no hold on a second hold on
[4129.54 --> 4134.34]  i got an idea i got to work around luke we just manually fully duplicate the entire streaming
[4134.34 --> 4140.90]  infrastructure we have now for each of them beautiful okay tell me it wouldn't work tell me it wouldn't work
[4140.90 --> 4151.30]  i mean yeah go on i think aj would have to like take the the second half of the year off and do all
[4151.30 --> 4157.38]  the rest of his hours in the next four weeks but tell me it wouldn't work if you could i mean you could
[4157.38 --> 4164.50]  do it hey there it is there let's get it done yeah we've done most of our work on vaud at this point um
[4164.50 --> 4172.50]  yeah all right uh okay do we have any other big topics i feel like we still do is there anything oh
[4172.50 --> 4179.22]  my goodness microsoft to permanently close all physical retail stores uh yeah apparently this was
[4179.22 --> 4186.10]  not uh pandemic related or at least not pandemic hinged like it wasn't purely done because of the
[4186.10 --> 4197.06]  pandemic um retail is dying i think at the same yeah retail is dying and i've walked past many a
[4197.06 --> 4203.46]  microsoft store and seen them completely empty um but i think microsoft is having a little bit of
[4203.46 --> 4209.22]  trouble like like honestly outside of xbox they are a little bit newer to the hardware space
[4209.22 --> 4217.30]  yes they're not brand new but they're a new player they needed more they need more actual
[4217.30 --> 4221.62]  microsoft products to make it worth it to go in their store and experience them and experience
[4221.62 --> 4227.94]  them working together that's why apple is successful because in order to you know part of experiencing an
[4227.94 --> 4231.94]  apple product is experiencing how it works with apple's other products whereas i don't think microsoft
[4231.94 --> 4237.38]  really has that story in a compelling way outside of xbox and even that is basically in its infancy as far
[4237.38 --> 4241.46]  as i can tell like they're really still like if if part of the experience of going to a microsoft
[4241.46 --> 4249.14]  store was gaming with my friend on a pc and me being on an xbox that'd be like super cool i'd be
[4249.14 --> 4252.50]  like yeah that's something that you that's an experience that you would have to go to a store
[4252.50 --> 4259.14]  in order to to have and fully fully appreciate um but when microsoft started just like filling up
[4259.14 --> 4263.06]  these stores with like partner notebook skews and stuff like that i was like what are you guys even
[4263.06 --> 4268.74]  doing like there's no money in reselling notebooks and i'm not that's not to say that there is zero
[4268.74 --> 4273.70]  money in it there's just not enough to support all that retail overhead and microsoft's not the kind of
[4273.70 --> 4281.06]  company that can afford the risk of having poorly trained people in their stores that you know create
[4281.06 --> 4287.14]  some kind of racist hullabaloo or whatever the case may be like you just you just can't afford it so they
[4287.14 --> 4291.94]  have to have expensive and thorough training programs and all that stuff and this there's just so much
[4291.94 --> 4299.78]  overhead involved so this doesn't surprise me uh see i have seen a lot of them so i thought they were
[4299.78 --> 4309.54]  more common uh but apparently seven of them uh are in british columbia alberta and ontario so maybe
[4309.54 --> 4316.10]  that's why i think that but they only had 83 stores worldwide which is a lot less than i thought 72 of
[4316.10 --> 4325.06]  them were in u.s wow yeah so they were basically all north american yep so this was they have one in
[4325.06 --> 4331.06]  the taiwan tech mall is that like the other one i'm not sure i thought like razer had a store there
[4331.06 --> 4336.98]  or something i think they only have four outside of that so like yeah i i don't know online's the way to
[4336.98 --> 4341.38]  go and they've got some cool new features coming to their online storefronts including one-to-one video
[4341.38 --> 4348.98]  chat that's pretty cool online tutorials virtual workshops and more digital solutions that makes
[4348.98 --> 4354.18]  so much more sense because it's like i remember someone talking to me about why i don't do more
[4354.18 --> 4360.66]  in-person uh fan engagement and the the cold hard truth is that it's not great use of my time not
[4360.66 --> 4366.90]  because i don't enjoy it i really do and that's why we do ltx or at least we normally do uh because i i
[4366.90 --> 4374.66]  love it it's a blast the problem is that if i have two hours to do something i can either tweet
[4374.66 --> 4381.46]  like hey anyone want to meet up at the starbucks and i can engage with three people or i can sit
[4381.46 --> 4386.18]  down in front of my computer and live stream and engage with a thousand people or ten thousand people
[4386.18 --> 4391.30]  or a hundred thousand people uh so you know what's a better return on the investment of my time at
[4391.30 --> 4396.82]  that point online i don't think your civ streams get a hundred thousand people bro they get a thousand
[4396.82 --> 4398.58]  and that was one of the numbers i said
[4403.78 --> 4409.54]  if i make a video i can reach a hundred thousand people like that so there you go smart guy true
[4409.54 --> 4414.34]  yeah one cool thing actually in hearing the part about like the the one-to-one video chat
[4414.34 --> 4421.46]  yeah online tutorials virtual workshops and stuff like that is there's no information yet about layoffs
[4421.46 --> 4428.66]  i would find it extremely difficult for them to keep everyone related to all 83 stores employed in
[4428.66 --> 4434.26]  those ways but they might be able to flip some of them and be able to retain any of these people during
[4435.06 --> 4440.90]  a pandemic is really good news for those people yeah and being able to transition those people to
[4440.90 --> 4445.46]  potentially working from home is also kind of a cool idea um some of the microsoft stores will
[4445.46 --> 4451.54]  apparently be reimagined as microsoft experience centers in london new york city sydney and redmond
[4452.18 --> 4456.98]  that might even be a better idea oh man there's like so much news this week we didn't even talk
[4456.98 --> 4461.46]  about this yet uh nvidia releases the first driver with direct x12 ultimate support and hardware
[4461.46 --> 4465.78]  accelerated gpu scheduling also there's a windows update that shows your gpu temps right in task
[4465.78 --> 4472.42]  manager that's so cool um so this is really good news for rtx card owners making rtx variable rate shading
[4472.42 --> 4476.98]  and mesh shading easier for developers to implement that's great they also support hardware accelerated
[4476.98 --> 4481.94]  gpu scheduling which allows the gpu to directly manage vram sweet microsoft says this lowers latency
[4481.94 --> 4488.74]  and can lead to higher minimum fps numbers love it and there was just one more thing that i wanted to
[4488.74 --> 4492.98]  wow we didn't even talk about the whole apple arm thing but that's okay i did a dedicated video
[4492.98 --> 4495.70]  about that reaching a million people by the way luke um
[4495.70 --> 4504.18]  uh wait no i guess that's it was it just like a super chat thing that i had wanted to talk about
[4504.18 --> 4512.18]  uh steam summer sale uh steam summer sale rip your wallet civ6 is 15 bucks um oh you gotta be you gotta
[4512.18 --> 4521.22]  be kidding me i just paid 80 canadian dollars for it uh you may be able to uh ask for a refund and uh
[4521.22 --> 4525.94]  uh they they will basically give you the difference between the discounted price yeah it's called price
[4525.94 --> 4531.06]  protection yeah i can i can apply for price protection i made i may just do that because
[4531.06 --> 4538.10]  that's a lot of money anyway there's also a bunch of other interesting discounts it's the steam summer
[4538.10 --> 4541.94]  sale almost every discount is going to be the same as almost every other steam sale but there is some
[4541.94 --> 4547.14]  cool stuff in there man there's even super chats about how doomed retail is macy's is apparently cutting
[4547.14 --> 4554.02]  staff i just saw on the news a couple days ago gnc filing for bankruptcy and closing 1200 stores
[4554.02 --> 4560.98]  so that's like one of those like supplement vitamin places chuck e cheese no bankruptcy yeah chuck e cheese
[4561.62 --> 4562.66]  not chuck e cheese
[4565.30 --> 4569.14]  chuck e cheese parent company closed 34 locations permanently whoa
[4569.14 --> 4574.82]  it's it i went there a little while ago the one in langley it was pretty bad
[4576.34 --> 4582.26]  it's like they haven't really done anything they had that story about reusing pizza and stuff too yeah
[4584.42 --> 4590.18]  yeah crash crawlies crash crawlies for life actually their food's pretty bad too
[4593.70 --> 4598.98]  uh anyway sorry back to back to super chats here um pro gogurt says how do you think
[4598.98 --> 4606.18]  the ps5 ssd will compare to optane um i mean it's just it's such an apples to oranges comparison
[4606.18 --> 4616.10]  optane is all about low latency and the ps5 ssd is all about uh architecting um the whole system so that
[4616.82 --> 4622.74]  games have direct access to the data on it so it's just like it's just not the same thing at all
[4623.46 --> 4628.98]  so to speak uh aj35 lightning says would you consider daily in the new xperia one actually yeah
[4629.54 --> 4635.78]  i would definitely consider it because the one thing my note 9 does not do well these days compared to
[4635.78 --> 4638.74]  uh newer phones is the camera is falling behind a little bit
[4641.78 --> 4642.02]  uh
[4646.26 --> 4652.66]  core maximus says after 90 90 days after purchase netgear charges a hundred dollars for phone support to file an
[4652.66 --> 4656.18]  rma really wish i didn't buy a nighthawk after seeing your sponsored vid i'm really sorry to
[4656.18 --> 4662.98]  hear that is there a reason you didn't file an rma online though you got to understand i mean i'm not
[4662.98 --> 4668.66]  saying this is right that's horrible and they shouldn't do that but netgear is more of like a b2b um
[4668.66 --> 4675.46]  slash uh yeah business to business company and so it's pretty normal for you to have paid phone support
[4675.46 --> 4679.94]  after a very short period of time for those types of products and i think this is one of those cases where
[4679.94 --> 4683.70]  they just don't really fully understand that when you're selling to consumers you like actually
[4683.70 --> 4689.54]  can't do that um so yeah raise a stink complain uh try and get a refund but it doesn't surprise me
[4689.54 --> 4694.18]  that much but that also doesn't mean that it's necessarily a bad product i'm sorry yours was uh doa
[4694.18 --> 4701.06]  though uh ludo says i'm already paying on float plane hi from quebec you inspired me to work in it
[4701.06 --> 4705.70]  and leave the field because i liked it better as a hobby lmao you know i don't even blame you
[4705.70 --> 4715.22]  don't even blame you yeah what else we got here uh muhammad says since ten dollars thanks for the
[4715.22 --> 4719.14]  free bottle replacement after the paint job faded it's not free anymore if you send a ten dollar
[4719.14 --> 4727.06]  super chat dude uh general disregard says uh gotta keep the personal protective wait no ppt what's ppt
[4727.06 --> 4736.18]  performance on point ppt what is ppt performance luke help me out performance product technology
[4737.14 --> 4740.34]  oh powerpoint oh that's probably when we're talking about the intel thing all right fair enough
[4741.46 --> 4746.66]  oh what else we got in the intel slides it compared to 3400g with integrated graphics versus an i3 with a
[4746.66 --> 4752.10]  dedicated gpu i actually didn't even notice that i'd have to look closer at them to validate that but
[4752.10 --> 4760.10]  uh all right thanks christian johnson um let me have a look is there anything else uh josh asks
[4760.10 --> 4765.30]  how can float plane succeed when mixer and microsoft cannot yes it's different but float plane was just
[4765.30 --> 4772.18]  included in the same category let's hear it well float plane for better or for worse hasn't really
[4772.18 --> 4781.30]  found its um its calling yet i mean i think if luke and i had said two years ago uh you know what let's
[4781.30 --> 4787.94]  do an only fans type concept uh float plane could absolutely be a gigantic platform today it's not
[4787.94 --> 4794.66]  a deficiency of the actual video delivery technology it's just a matter of us figuring out sort of what
[4794.66 --> 4800.34]  the identity needs to be because i think the earlier vision was that creators would just kind of decide
[4800.34 --> 4809.14]  what the identity was but that seems to have kind of uh made our messaging unclear we still we still have
[4809.14 --> 4813.94]  work to do on the site anyway and the thing about float plane is that massive shout out by the way to
[4813.94 --> 4820.10]  our float plane pilots and all the people who follow slash subscribe slash whatever we call it um on
[4820.10 --> 4826.50]  float plane to linus media group and to the other creators we have on there like bitwit tech deals uh ufd
[4827.14 --> 4833.78]  forgotten weapons is one that's actually been crushing it on the platform lately uh he's uploaded
[4833.78 --> 4841.30]  he's uploaded look at this he's uploaded 10 videos in the last week and just like killing it there i
[4841.30 --> 4846.98]  already watched a lot of his content but now i watched like a lot a lot of his content really cool
[4846.98 --> 4855.86]  stuff really cool stuff um a fun one about that i don't i don't know worst ak ever i'm gonna go into it
[4855.86 --> 4863.06]  anyways but um a fun one about that is that i can watch his content with my grandpa right and
[4863.06 --> 4869.06]  my grandpa super into that yeah and he'll he'll like add in his own like experience or knowledge of
[4869.06 --> 4873.62]  of those firearms and whatever else as well and that's really interesting too so that's it's it's
[4873.62 --> 4878.26]  made this like cool loop where i just like email my grandpa videos from him and go like oh i thought
[4878.26 --> 4882.02]  this one was cool because of these reasons and where your grandpa actually understands what you do for
[4882.02 --> 4887.54]  a living even though you're like a developer it's pretty much the only thing that's been able to like
[4888.42 --> 4894.34]  bring us together in that way it's been kind of cool that is very cool because i remember your grandpa
[4894.34 --> 4900.98]  was not super approving of like our shenanigans in the early days with a knife at one point that was
[4900.98 --> 4908.82]  very awkward yeah that was that was really not great he also when i made the uh i don't know if the
[4908.82 --> 4914.74]  the audience knows this but when i made the fallout bomb video um he took that a little seriously
[4914.74 --> 4921.06]  instead of just like that i built a computer inside of a a thing a prop from a video game
[4921.06 --> 4925.22]  because the authorities might come for you and stuff and i'm like it's okay it's okay it's okay gramps
[4925.22 --> 4932.50]  they're a little bit more calm about internet stuff these days yeah i'm sorry yep um so yeah because
[4932.50 --> 4938.42]  of the supporters that we have over there now we can take our time uh we don't have to worry about like oh
[4938.42 --> 4943.70]  you know we're losing money well we gotta we gotta sell this thing or we gotta you know go raise a
[4943.70 --> 4947.78]  bunch of venture capital from people who are going to pressure us to sell it or pressure us to to
[4947.78 --> 4952.18]  change it in ways that we don't agree with or whatever the case may be um we can take our time
[4952.18 --> 4958.66]  we can figure out what it is um you know i'll i'll say it outright like i would not be against bringing
[4958.66 --> 4966.02]  on a controversial figure like dr dr disrespect or i would not be against what happened first yeah i guess
[4966.02 --> 4971.94]  i wouldn't mind knowing what happened but in general we are not looking to shy away from
[4971.94 --> 4977.14]  controversial figures and i don't even think we would shy away from someone who's posting explicit
[4977.14 --> 4982.58]  stuff either like it's it doesn't really have an identity and that was sort of intentional um but
[4982.58 --> 4987.78]  we'll see whether we decide to change that in the future and and kind of rebranded in some way or
[4987.78 --> 4992.98]  whether we decide to leave it the way that it is right yeah so that's my long answer to that question
[4992.98 --> 5000.50]  um eric jackson says can i get a shout out for adored tv he was even on one of those video card
[5000.50 --> 5006.58]  slides there it is shout out to adored tv right there yeah and i think that's pretty much it for
