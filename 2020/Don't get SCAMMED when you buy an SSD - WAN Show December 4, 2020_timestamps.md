where are the timestamps??? I wanna skip to the part where the whole sarah interview stops.
No offense to her, it's just I come here to watch 2 guys talk about tech and random shit, not to watch 2 guys giggle over an even more giggly woman that knows and understands little about tech or tech industry. 
"I built my own computer.... okay.. well... I WATCHED somebody else build it for me." yeah yeah I've heard it all before.
