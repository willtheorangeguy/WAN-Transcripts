[0.00 → 3.98] I pressed resume selected, and then it immediately turned green.
[4.58 → 7.46] I guess that's because it just wasn't actually doing anything.
[8.20 → 10.46] Okay, so supposedly we're live.
[11.62 → 12.32] Okay.
[15.02 → 18.44] And welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen.
[18.74 → 22.86] This is going to be a pretty emotional stream for me today
[22.86 → 26.80] because one of the topics, the headline topic,
[26.80 → 31.06] is something that is very, very near to my heart,
[31.62 → 34.18] something I'm extremely passionate about
[34.18 → 38.06] and something that within the last couple of hours
[38.06 → 39.86] has had further development,
[40.08 → 41.44] some of which I can talk about,
[41.86 → 43.02] some of which I can't,
[43.02 → 46.02] that have led me to be extremely...
[46.92 → 50.92] I'm going to use exactly the same word that I used
[50.92 → 56.92] to the person that is involved in this.
[58.74 → 59.64] Extremely upset.
[60.06 → 61.94] I am extremely upset right now.
[62.38 → 63.84] This is a bad situation
[63.84 → 65.80] and it's one that we really need to talk about.
[66.02 → 69.06] So, of course, our first topic of the day
[69.06 → 70.72] is Hardware Unboxed,
[70.78 → 71.72] who, quite frankly,
[72.08 → 75.40] I don't even have a pre-existing relationship with.
[75.40 → 78.42] I've exchanged a greeting with him once at a trade show,
[78.50 → 79.54] which I didn't even remember.
[79.54 → 80.62] He reminded me of it.
[81.12 → 82.10] But other than that,
[82.16 → 84.18] my first time ever speaking to Steve
[84.18 → 86.28] was last night when I saw a tweet
[86.28 → 87.78] that was sent out by him.
[88.16 → 89.86] Massive shout out to our community, by the way,
[89.90 → 90.92] for bringing it to my attention.
[92.76 → 94.60] Sorry, this is just the topics of the show.
[94.66 → 95.70] We'll get into this later.
[96.44 → 99.56] But Hardware Unboxed has apparently been
[99.56 → 101.50] taken off the list
[101.50 → 104.66] for receiving GeForce Founders Edition review samples
[104.66 → 110.04] due to a focus on rasterization over ray tracing.
[110.54 → 112.84] And that might not sound like the biggest deal ever,
[112.98 → 114.48] but it actually is.
[114.64 → 116.80] This is an enormous...
[116.80 → 118.54] This is an earthquake
[118.54 → 121.46] that is happening right now in the industry.
[121.82 → 123.70] And I will explain why.
[123.70 → 125.92] Other topics today.
[126.42 → 127.54] In lighter news,
[127.68 → 129.60] we're going to chat about the collab
[129.60 → 131.36] that I did with Electro Boom today.
[132.04 → 133.68] You know, I'm not going to spoil anything
[133.68 → 135.70] because I don't think there's anything to spoil.
[136.02 → 138.22] What did you guys think was going to happen?
[138.52 → 140.40] I get hurt by electricity.
[140.68 → 142.42] He gets hurt by electricity.
[142.70 → 143.80] It's going to be great.
[145.46 → 146.58] What else we got, Luke?
[147.24 → 150.30] Cyberpunk 2077 has various problems.
[150.30 → 152.56] I think that's one way of putting it.
[152.84 → 154.46] There's like three different topics there,
[154.54 → 156.58] but they're all about it just like having problems.
[156.74 → 158.28] So we'll talk about that.
[158.64 → 161.24] Also, I'm going to skip over the other topic actually
[161.24 → 164.64] and say the RX 6900 XT launched.
[164.96 → 165.30] Heck yeah.
[165.52 → 165.80] All right.
[165.92 → 166.24] Nice.
[166.86 → 167.34] Nice.
[167.56 → 170.58] And in perhaps the biggest news of the day,
[171.04 → 172.44] speaking of things that launched,
[172.98 → 174.30] LTTstore.com.
[174.40 → 175.78] It's finally up.
[176.62 → 179.18] The Linus Tech Tips Northern Lights Desk Pad.
[179.18 → 180.34] It's finally here.
[180.62 → 183.16] Look at all these sizes, ladies and gentlemen.
[183.50 → 185.16] We made it in every size.
[185.32 → 185.94] And guess what?
[186.18 → 187.50] They're all the same price.
[187.76 → 188.30] That's right.
[188.48 → 192.60] You can get a 1.2 meter by 700 millimetre desk pad
[192.60 → 193.74] for $29.99.
[194.64 → 197.54] Or you could get one that's a more reasonable size
[197.54 → 200.08] if you're into that sort of thing.
[200.64 → 201.52] It looks great.
[202.76 → 203.52] All right.
[203.60 → 205.10] Let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[205.10 → 212.18] Holy crap.
[212.24 → 214.04] You really do have every size ever, don't you?
[214.52 → 215.34] That was the goal.
[219.96 → 222.22] Also, was it like strategically designed
[222.22 → 225.66] so that the right side is more blank?
[225.66 → 227.10] Yes.
[227.38 → 227.66] Yes.
[227.92 → 229.34] It absolutely was, believe it or not.
[229.86 → 230.82] Here, I'm just...
[230.82 → 235.14] This is how IK2 could be part of your super clean setup.
[235.30 → 235.70] There you go.
[235.78 → 236.96] So that's one of the...
[236.96 → 243.30] I believe this is the 0.9 meters by 30 centimetres versions.
[244.10 → 247.24] So yes, this side over here is left blank intentionally
[247.24 → 249.52] because some mice tend to have tracking issues
[249.52 → 251.36] over high contrast barriers.
[251.70 → 253.22] So we wanted to make sure that
[253.22 → 255.32] no matter what kind of mouse you have,
[255.34 → 256.14] it's going to track well.
[256.14 → 260.20] But we wanted it to have like a really nice graphical design on it as well.
[261.56 → 261.96] Okay.
[262.92 → 263.86] Enough of that.
[264.24 → 267.38] Let's get into the big topic for today.
[267.76 → 269.02] Hardware unboxed.
[269.74 → 271.10] Removed from the...
[271.10 → 271.26] Okay.
[271.54 → 272.64] So here's what we have.
[273.02 → 275.26] I have spoken with Steve ahead of the show today
[275.26 → 277.64] and I have gotten his permission to share
[277.64 → 279.38] for the first time, is my understanding,
[279.84 → 283.88] the full email that he received from NVIDIA.
[283.88 → 286.80] Luke, can you do us the honours?
[286.98 → 289.96] Because I really don't know if I'm going to make it through this.
[290.42 → 291.24] Do you want me to do the email?
[291.62 → 291.86] Yeah.
[292.00 → 293.04] Can you read the email, please?
[293.40 → 293.68] Yes.
[293.96 → 294.12] Yep.
[294.32 → 294.70] All right.
[295.78 → 296.42] Hi, Steve.
[297.00 → 300.74] We have reached a critical juncture in the adoption of ray tracing
[300.74 → 304.82] and it has gained industry-wide support
[304.82 → 307.46] from top titles, developers, game engines,
[307.88 → 310.60] APIs, consoles, and GPUs.
[310.60 → 313.98] As you know, NVIDIA is all in for ray tracing.
[314.40 → 318.72] RT is important and core to the future of gaming,
[318.90 → 322.08] but it's also one part of our focused R&D efforts
[322.08 → 324.28] on revolutionizing video games
[324.28 → 326.58] and creating a better experience for gamers.
[326.84 → 330.20] This philosophy is also reflected in developing technologies
[330.20 → 333.82] such as DLSS, Reflex, and Broadcast
[333.82 → 336.66] that offer immense value to customers
[336.66 → 338.04] who are purchasing a GPU.
[338.04 → 340.20] They don't get free GPUs,
[340.28 → 341.52] they work hard for their money,
[341.62 → 343.58] and they keep their GPUs for multiple years.
[344.12 → 345.80] Despite all this progress,
[346.38 → 348.64] your GPU reviews and recommendations
[348.64 → 351.22] have continued to focus singularly
[351.22 → 352.96] on rasterization performance
[352.96 → 355.20] and you have largely discounted
[355.20 → 358.02] all the other technologies we offer gamers.
[358.38 → 360.96] It is very clear from your community commentary
[360.96 → 363.00] that you do not see things
[363.00 → 365.68] the same way that we, gamers,
[365.68 → 367.52] and the rest of the industry do.
[368.34 → 369.68] Our Founders Edition's boards
[369.68 → 371.26] and other NVIDIA products
[371.26 → 373.16] are being allocated to media outlets
[373.16 → 375.74] that recognize the changing landscape of gaming
[375.74 → 378.06] and the features that are important to gamers
[378.06 → 380.08] and anyone buying a GPU today,
[380.44 → 382.32] be it for gaming, content creation,
[382.76 → 383.82] or studio and streaming.
[384.90 → 387.28] Hardware Unboxed should continue to work
[387.28 → 389.18] with our add-in card partners
[389.18 → 391.16] to secure GPUs to review.
[391.62 → 393.70] Of course, you will still have access
[393.70 → 395.42] to obtain pre-release drivers
[395.42 → 396.46] and press materials.
[396.74 → 397.88] That won't change.
[398.50 → 401.58] We are open to revisiting this in the future
[401.58 → 404.06] should your editorial direction change.
[405.42 → 405.90] Hold on.
[405.90 → 407.98] I don't know if you want me to sign it off, but...
[407.98 → 408.40] Go ahead.
[409.22 → 410.16] Brian Del Rizzo,
[410.80 → 413.34] Director of Global PR, G-Force.
[413.34 → 413.98] Okay.
[418.24 → 420.58] For those of you who listened to that
[420.58 → 421.08] and went,
[422.12 → 423.46] well, yeah,
[423.76 → 425.34] NVIDIA doesn't have to send graphics cards
[425.34 → 426.34] to anyone they don't want to.
[427.64 → 428.78] That's a fair point.
[429.36 → 431.00] That is not the problem.
[431.80 → 433.22] There's lots of people
[433.22 → 436.52] that NVIDIA does not send graphics cards to
[436.52 → 437.22] for review
[437.22 → 440.00] for a wide variety of reasons.
[440.00 → 443.64] whether they are not qualified
[443.64 → 445.70] to review graphics cards
[445.70 → 447.74] or whether they do not have
[447.74 → 448.80] a large enough audience
[448.80 → 451.12] to justify the expense
[451.12 → 452.98] of not just the graphics card.
[453.08 → 454.20] That's actually not really
[454.20 → 456.58] the biggest part of the expense
[456.58 → 457.98] of engaging with media.
[458.36 → 460.06] The personnel that it takes
[460.06 → 461.68] to maintain that relationship.
[461.94 → 464.00] Like, there are lots of costs associated.
[464.14 → 464.92] You cannot engage
[464.92 → 466.16] with every single publication.
[466.60 → 466.88] Sure.
[467.48 → 467.96] I get it.
[468.34 → 469.96] NVIDIA is not obligated
[469.96 → 471.28] to send graphics cards
[471.28 → 472.36] to anybody.
[473.04 → 474.66] The problem here
[474.66 → 476.70] is the argument
[476.70 → 478.80] that is being put forward
[478.80 → 480.16] because this is not
[480.16 → 482.36] NVIDIA saying,
[482.66 → 482.98] you know,
[483.46 → 483.76] hey,
[484.20 → 485.26] sorry,
[485.42 → 487.64] we only have so many
[487.64 → 488.64] Founders Edition cards
[488.64 → 489.40] to send out
[489.40 → 492.10] and you didn't make the cut
[492.10 → 493.82] because it's going to be
[493.82 → 495.32] only people with a million subscribers
[495.32 → 496.46] or more from now on.
[496.62 → 497.54] That's our new policy.
[497.82 → 498.24] You know, sorry.
[498.40 → 499.74] We would have loved to work with you.
[499.74 → 501.98] This is NVIDIA
[501.98 → 504.62] making a clear,
[505.20 → 507.26] clear line in the sand
[507.26 → 508.44] that says,
[508.62 → 511.92] you will not be receiving
[511.92 → 513.18] our products
[513.18 → 516.58] because you do not agree
[516.58 → 518.56] with NVIDIA's position
[518.56 → 520.62] about what is good
[520.62 → 522.40] about NVIDIA's products.
[522.40 → 523.96] And this is somewhere
[523.96 → 525.10] where I think it actually
[525.10 → 526.16] is almost even
[526.16 → 526.94] a little bit worse
[526.94 → 527.40] than that.
[527.52 → 528.86] Something that actually
[528.86 → 530.20] really drove me nuts.
[530.20 → 530.90] Well, I'm going to go through
[530.90 → 531.92] line by line here, Luke.
[532.60 → 532.86] Okay.
[532.98 → 534.34] Just based off
[534.34 → 534.92] what you just said,
[535.00 → 535.96] give me one moment.
[536.06 → 536.22] Yeah.
[536.38 → 536.68] Okay.
[536.78 → 537.02] All right.
[537.08 → 538.72] I'm real fired up
[538.72 → 539.30] right now, Luke.
[540.18 → 541.16] It is very clear
[541.16 → 542.18] from your community commentary
[542.18 → 543.30] that you do not see things
[543.30 → 543.86] the same way
[543.86 → 544.78] that we...
[544.78 → 545.32] Okay, fine.
[545.48 → 545.92] Good enough.
[546.06 → 547.26] But then they also include
[547.26 → 548.90] that we gamers
[548.90 → 550.86] and the rest of the industry do.
[551.02 → 551.78] So they are trying
[551.78 → 552.72] to make them feel
[552.72 → 553.74] small and alone.
[554.24 → 556.02] That is some presumptuous
[556.02 → 556.92] right there
[556.92 → 557.78] for starters.
[558.50 → 558.70] Yes.
[558.80 → 559.82] And for number two,
[561.10 → 561.36] okay,
[561.50 → 562.24] that is not even
[562.24 → 563.72] the most strong arm
[563.72 → 565.04] mafia bullshit
[565.04 → 566.08] that's going on here.
[566.20 → 567.80] Not even by a long shot.
[568.34 → 568.50] No.
[568.66 → 569.34] So we...
[569.34 → 569.62] Just pretty important
[569.62 → 570.20] what you're saying.
[570.38 → 571.48] We are going to start...
[571.48 → 572.12] We're going to start
[572.12 → 573.44] with the beginning here, okay?
[573.98 → 574.40] We've reached
[574.40 → 575.66] a critical juncture
[575.66 → 576.48] in the adoption
[576.48 → 577.44] of ray tracing
[577.44 → 578.40] and it has gained
[578.40 → 579.62] industry-wide support
[579.62 → 580.50] from top titles,
[580.66 → 581.00] developers,
[581.20 → 581.56] game engines,
[581.74 → 582.60] APIs, consoles,
[582.82 → 583.60] and GPUs.
[584.54 → 584.90] Okay.
[585.02 → 585.72] You want a metal?
[586.58 → 587.42] Like...
[587.42 → 588.34] Okay.
[589.00 → 589.98] I don't even...
[589.98 → 591.46] I don't even dispute that.
[592.12 → 593.46] But that's not the topic
[593.46 → 594.56] of conversation today.
[595.28 → 595.42] Yeah.
[595.60 → 596.26] As you know,
[596.42 → 597.62] NVIDIA is all in
[597.62 → 598.60] for ray tracing.
[599.54 → 600.06] Okay.
[600.26 → 600.92] It's important
[600.92 → 601.84] and core to the future
[601.84 → 602.24] of gaming.
[602.52 → 603.68] I don't dispute that.
[604.04 → 605.06] We don't have a problem yet.
[605.56 → 607.30] It's also only one part
[607.30 → 609.02] of our focused R&D efforts
[609.02 → 610.94] on revolutionizing video games
[610.94 → 611.90] and creating a better
[611.90 → 613.10] experience for gamers.
[613.80 → 614.40] Uh...
[614.40 → 615.38] Okay.
[616.02 → 616.90] This philosophy
[616.90 → 617.40] is reflected
[617.40 → 618.48] in developing technologies
[618.48 → 619.36] like deep learning,
[619.50 → 620.08] super sampling,
[620.30 → 620.54] reflex,
[620.86 → 621.74] and broadcasts
[621.74 → 622.62] that offer immense values
[622.62 → 623.16] to consumers
[623.16 → 624.16] who are purchasing a GPU.
[624.52 → 625.08] I'm sorry,
[625.26 → 626.22] is this a letter
[626.22 → 627.32] or a press release?
[628.00 → 628.32] Like,
[628.70 → 630.02] you're literally telling
[630.02 → 631.30] hardware unboxed
[631.94 → 634.16] what an f***ING GPU does.
[634.16 → 636.00] Are you...
[636.00 → 637.04] What is...
[637.04 → 637.96] What is this...
[637.96 → 641.18] What is this patronizing nonsense?
[642.38 → 642.72] Okay.
[642.88 → 644.12] Now, here's where
[644.12 → 645.10] it gets really bad.
[646.08 → 646.26] Okay.
[647.58 → 648.14] Gamers,
[648.38 → 649.04] paraphrasing here,
[649.10 → 649.66] paraphrasing here,
[649.72 → 650.14] it says they.
[650.44 → 650.62] Okay.
[651.18 → 652.10] Consumers, gamers,
[652.46 → 654.64] they don't get free GPUs.
[654.80 → 655.86] They work hard
[655.86 → 656.64] for their money
[656.64 → 658.22] and they keep their GPUs
[658.22 → 659.34] for multiple years.
[659.34 → 662.78] This says a few things to me.
[663.42 → 664.14] Number one
[664.14 → 665.58] is it says that reviewers
[665.58 → 666.08] get,
[666.40 → 666.94] quote unquote,
[667.38 → 668.60] free GPUs.
[668.68 → 669.50] Like it is...
[669.50 → 672.22] It is benevolent NVIDIA
[672.22 → 674.46] that is bestowing upon you
[674.46 → 675.88] for which you should be grateful,
[676.04 → 677.54] for which you f***ING
[677.54 → 678.70] owe them something
[678.70 → 682.14] for granting you this GPU.
[682.86 → 685.20] I have a newsflash for NVIDIA,
[685.50 → 685.84] okay?
[686.28 → 687.70] And I'm not the only one.
[687.70 → 689.50] In the time since I started
[689.50 → 690.50] the pre-stream,
[691.04 → 691.26] okay?
[691.48 → 693.10] The pre-stream for this show
[693.10 → 694.34] until now,
[694.66 → 696.00] based on one call-out
[696.00 → 697.04] for our mouse pad,
[697.18 → 698.14] I have made enough
[698.14 → 700.60] to buy 10 RTX 3090s.
[700.72 → 702.18] I don't f***ING care.
[702.62 → 704.26] I don't need your graphics card.
[704.56 → 705.88] And this is not about that.
[706.90 → 707.70] Number two.
[708.24 → 709.26] Number two issue.
[709.56 → 710.20] Now, to be clear,
[710.28 → 711.78] the mouse pad was a big launch for us.
[711.86 → 713.56] That's like not the ordinary.
[713.92 → 715.12] But there are more issues here.
[715.46 → 716.14] Number two
[716.14 → 717.90] is the way that this is worded.
[717.96 → 719.24] There is a transaction
[719.24 → 720.32] that's taking place here.
[720.40 → 721.94] There's absolutely a transaction,
[722.12 → 724.28] but there are multiple transactions,
[724.76 → 725.02] okay?
[725.34 → 727.10] You are giving the media
[727.10 → 728.10] this card,
[728.18 → 729.60] but it's about more than the card.
[729.86 → 731.60] It's access to the drivers
[731.60 → 732.54] ahead of time.
[732.94 → 734.20] It's access to
[734.20 → 736.20] media briefing materials
[736.20 → 737.26] that allow us
[737.26 → 738.60] to cover it properly.
[739.06 → 741.10] And it is not for us.
[741.28 → 742.72] It is for your consumers.
[742.72 → 744.86] It is to educate your consumers,
[744.86 → 746.96] which if you make a good product,
[747.10 → 749.04] is effectively marketing.
[749.56 → 751.18] If you make something good
[751.18 → 753.66] and you educate consumers about it,
[753.80 → 756.04] you are effectively marketing the product.
[756.30 → 757.40] So in that way,
[757.70 → 760.16] reviewers are a marketing exercise
[760.16 → 761.32] for NVIDIA.
[761.48 → 762.96] But you have to understand
[762.96 → 764.40] that that's a transaction
[764.40 → 765.24] that takes place
[765.24 → 766.60] with the consumer
[766.60 → 768.02] who reads the review.
[768.60 → 769.70] With the reviewer,
[769.80 → 771.14] there's only one transaction.
[771.14 → 773.16] There's one transaction.
[773.76 → 775.62] The reviewer is given the tools
[775.62 → 777.78] to do their job properly
[777.78 → 779.24] and on time
[779.24 → 780.88] in a way to educate consumers.
[781.30 → 782.72] And you are given
[782.72 → 785.36] a fair and unbiased review.
[785.60 → 787.14] That is it.
[787.96 → 789.32] That is all the value
[789.32 → 791.22] that your graphics card has to me.
[791.52 → 792.90] And I think I speak for
[792.90 → 794.88] Gamers Nexus,
[795.18 → 796.26] Hardware Unboxed,
[796.50 → 797.20] Anand Tech.
[797.34 → 798.32] I think I can speak for
[798.32 → 799.44] basically anyone
[799.44 → 801.48] who has any kind of reputation
[801.48 → 803.24] to uphold with their audience
[803.24 → 804.16] when I say that
[804.16 → 805.32] this is not about
[805.32 → 806.92] getting a graphics card.
[807.70 → 808.00] Okay?
[810.10 → 811.14] Let's move on.
[812.14 → 813.80] Also, they work hard for their money.
[814.00 → 814.50] Yeah.
[814.70 → 814.94] Okay.
[815.04 → 815.70] Oh, no.
[815.76 → 816.70] We're not done yet here.
[817.00 → 818.70] And they keep their GPUs
[818.70 → 819.58] for multiple years.
[819.72 → 821.70] So what you're basically saying here
[821.70 → 824.72] is that unless we're selling a feature
[824.72 → 827.12] based on its future utility,
[827.64 → 829.10] we're not doing a good job?
[829.26 → 829.50] No.
[829.66 → 830.76] That's your job.
[830.92 → 832.18] That's your job
[832.18 → 833.78] to convince the entire industry
[833.78 → 835.92] to adopt these features
[835.92 → 837.26] and to create value
[837.26 → 838.18] in the longer term.
[838.40 → 839.54] It is our job
[839.54 → 840.38] to evaluate it
[840.38 → 841.86] as it is today.
[842.32 → 842.72] So yeah,
[842.84 → 843.44] that's fine
[843.44 → 844.58] that they keep their GPUs
[844.58 → 845.32] for multiple years.
[846.16 → 847.28] Good for you.
[847.76 → 849.46] But we can only evaluate
[849.46 → 850.38] what we can see.
[850.38 → 852.16] And the danger that I see here
[852.16 → 854.74] is when we covered RTX 20 series,
[855.08 → 857.76] we had exactly the same conclusion
[857.76 → 859.48] about real-time ray tracing
[859.48 → 860.96] with your RTX feature
[860.96 → 862.18] as Hardware Unbox
[862.18 → 863.12] and Gamers Nexus
[863.12 → 864.84] and basically anyone else
[864.84 → 866.64] who objectively evaluates this stuff.
[866.94 → 868.82] It came at a gigantic performance hit,
[869.26 → 869.76] we think.
[869.88 → 870.84] That actually came later.
[871.00 → 872.90] And there were absolutely no titles
[872.90 → 874.30] that supported the technology.
[874.70 → 875.68] So what we said was
[875.68 → 877.10] don't buy based on this
[877.10 → 878.80] because there's no support right now.
[878.80 → 880.18] And as we've seen time
[880.18 → 882.34] and time and time again,
[882.98 → 884.92] the first generation of GPUs
[884.92 → 886.08] to support basically
[886.08 → 887.10] anything
[887.10 → 888.60] by the time
[888.60 → 890.50] it's actually supported industry-wide
[890.50 → 891.94] is not powerful enough
[891.94 → 893.26] to meaningfully utilize
[893.26 → 894.28] that feature anyway.
[894.52 → 896.02] And there is nothing wrong
[896.02 → 896.92] with that take.
[897.34 → 898.64] Nothing wrong with it at all.
[898.76 → 900.58] We can only market
[900.58 → 901.76] because remember,
[902.58 → 903.84] this is marketing for you.
[904.02 → 904.78] But we,
[905.12 → 906.18] because of our relationship
[906.18 → 907.10] with the audience,
[907.10 → 908.36] can only market
[908.36 → 910.10] what we can actually measure.
[910.38 → 911.54] That's our job.
[911.84 → 912.72] Now, if you want to go
[912.72 → 914.62] and do a sponsored video
[914.62 → 915.72] with Hardware Unboxed
[915.72 → 916.80] or with us for that matter
[916.80 → 917.48] and you say,
[917.56 → 918.22] okay, look,
[918.36 → 919.40] here's the talking points
[919.40 → 920.06] we want to hit.
[920.74 → 921.36] Because of,
[921.58 → 922.46] aside from just
[922.46 → 924.36] FTC guidelines,
[924.90 → 926.46] because of personal integrity,
[926.84 → 927.94] I think most people
[927.94 → 929.54] are not going to say anything
[929.54 → 932.16] that they can't actually agree with,
[932.20 → 933.66] that they don't actually believe.
[933.66 → 935.04] but you're welcome
[935.04 → 936.74] to have your marketing points
[936.74 → 938.32] built into content like that.
[938.62 → 940.82] But in the transaction
[940.82 → 941.52] that occurs
[941.52 → 942.70] when you send out
[942.70 → 944.58] a review sample,
[945.16 → 946.54] a review sample,
[947.00 → 949.18] you don't get to dictate
[949.18 → 951.12] what the person says.
[951.34 → 953.28] And they don't have to factor in
[953.28 → 954.48] anything you say
[954.48 → 955.84] if they don't want to.
[955.90 → 957.64] And you cannot like that.
[957.64 → 959.70] But then,
[960.14 → 961.38] let's move on
[961.38 → 963.36] about why this is more
[963.36 → 964.44] than just not liking it.
[965.50 → 966.68] Despite this progress,
[966.82 → 967.56] your GPU reviews
[967.56 → 968.14] and recommendations
[968.14 → 969.70] continue to focus singularly
[969.70 → 971.10] on rasterization performance
[971.10 → 972.94] and you have largely discounted
[972.94 → 973.80] all other technologies
[973.80 → 974.52] we offer to gamers.
[974.80 → 974.92] Okay.
[975.08 → 975.96] No offence to Steve
[975.96 → 976.80] from Hardware Unboxed.
[976.88 → 977.84] I don't watch your videos.
[978.00 → 978.40] I'm sorry.
[978.78 → 981.44] This entire fiasco going down
[981.44 → 983.88] is actually my first real dig
[983.88 → 985.12] into Hardware Unboxed
[985.12 → 986.18] because honestly,
[986.38 → 987.46] I have a limited amount
[987.46 → 987.84] of time.
[987.98 → 988.36] I'm sorry.
[988.86 → 990.98] I have not interacted
[990.98 → 991.60] with Steve
[991.60 → 992.64] from Hardware Unboxed
[992.64 → 994.58] ever until last night
[994.58 → 995.96] except he reminded me.
[996.06 → 996.78] I actually met him
[996.78 → 997.74] at a trade show once
[997.74 → 998.04] and apparently
[998.04 → 1000.46] we exchanged hellos.
[1000.54 → 1000.84] I'm sorry.
[1000.92 → 1001.60] I don't remember anything
[1001.60 → 1002.66] that happens at trade shows.
[1002.74 → 1003.54] I'm usually running on
[1003.54 → 1004.88] like four hours of sleep a night.
[1005.30 → 1005.94] I'm sorry.
[1006.00 → 1006.38] I can't.
[1006.42 → 1006.80] I can't.
[1007.36 → 1008.14] The point is
[1008.14 → 1009.96] I don't like
[1009.96 → 1011.62] have a horse in this race.
[1011.70 → 1012.54] I'm not like a fan
[1012.54 → 1013.82] of Steve from Hardware Unboxed
[1013.82 → 1014.76] or anything like that.
[1015.16 → 1016.68] But the email
[1016.68 → 1017.90] or what he tweeted initially
[1017.90 → 1018.58] because I hadn't seen
[1018.58 → 1019.40] the whole email yet
[1019.40 → 1021.26] looked so out of character
[1021.26 → 1022.30] not just for NVIDIA
[1022.30 → 1023.80] but for Brian Del Rizzo
[1023.80 → 1024.68] in particular
[1024.68 → 1025.74] that I was like
[1025.74 → 1027.26] what even is this?
[1027.56 → 1028.18] I have to know
[1028.18 → 1028.88] what's going on.
[1028.98 → 1029.94] So I immediately
[1029.94 → 1031.38] contacted Steve
[1031.38 → 1032.30] from Hardware Unboxed
[1032.30 → 1033.18] and I talked to him.
[1033.24 → 1033.48] I said
[1033.48 → 1036.04] what is actually going on here
[1036.04 → 1037.10] because this doesn't
[1037.10 → 1038.32] pass the sniff test.
[1038.74 → 1039.30] This doesn't
[1039.30 → 1041.14] jibe with anything
[1041.14 → 1041.64] that I know
[1041.64 → 1042.30] about NVIDIA
[1042.30 → 1043.36] in general
[1043.36 → 1044.92] or Brian in particular.
[1045.50 → 1047.20] This smells personal.
[1047.50 → 1048.72] What's going on here?
[1049.36 → 1050.80] And he said
[1050.80 → 1052.04] he sent me
[1052.04 → 1053.62] as evidence
[1053.62 → 1056.04] of his position
[1056.04 → 1056.86] which is that
[1056.86 → 1058.10] he covers NVIDIA
[1058.10 → 1058.94] fairly according
[1058.94 → 1060.18] to his opinion
[1060.18 → 1061.06] about the technology
[1061.06 → 1061.94] which is an opinion
[1061.94 → 1062.96] not a fact
[1062.96 → 1064.50] but he sent me
[1064.50 → 1065.10] examples
[1065.10 → 1066.44] of how he has covered
[1066.44 → 1067.04] NVIDIA in a way
[1067.04 → 1067.88] that he thinks is fair.
[1067.88 → 1068.76] He sent me
[1068.76 → 1070.60] their RTX 3080 review
[1070.60 → 1071.68] and he sent me
[1071.68 → 1072.32] their review
[1072.32 → 1073.84] he sent me some charts
[1073.84 → 1075.00] from their review
[1075.00 → 1077.04] of the 60
[1077.04 → 1078.00] it was either
[1078.00 → 1078.60] the 6800
[1078.60 → 1079.84] or 6900 XT.
[1079.90 → 1080.30] I want to get
[1080.30 → 1081.16] these details right
[1081.16 → 1081.78] because this is
[1081.78 → 1083.00] very important.
[1083.16 → 1084.30] 6900 XT
[1084.30 → 1085.40] he sent me charts
[1085.40 → 1085.76] from there
[1085.76 → 1087.28] he sent me a video
[1087.28 → 1089.04] specifically focused
[1089.04 → 1090.28] on DLSS
[1090.28 → 1091.32] and RTX
[1091.32 → 1092.24] actually excuse me
[1092.24 → 1093.16] RTX performance
[1093.16 → 1093.52] it just
[1093.52 → 1094.68] I'll get into that later
[1094.68 → 1095.74] I'll get into DLSS later.
[1096.58 → 1097.32] RTX performance
[1097.32 → 1099.40] post RTX 3080 launch
[1099.40 → 1101.50] I watched the conclusion
[1101.50 → 1103.26] of the RTX 3080 video
[1103.26 → 1105.22] I watched the entirety
[1105.22 → 1106.82] of the RTX
[1106.82 → 1107.72] ray tracing
[1107.72 → 1109.64] performance analysis video
[1109.64 → 1111.14] and I had a look
[1111.14 → 1111.76] at the graphs
[1111.76 → 1113.06] from the 6900 XT video
[1113.06 → 1113.54] I'm not going to
[1113.54 → 1114.60] overstate what I did
[1114.60 → 1115.94] it was what I could
[1115.94 → 1116.66] look at in the time
[1116.66 → 1117.54] that I had in the bath
[1117.54 → 1118.38] and I will tell you
[1118.38 → 1119.74] what my impressions are
[1119.74 → 1120.04] okay
[1120.04 → 1121.14] number one
[1121.14 → 1122.38] I thought that
[1122.38 → 1123.22] if anything
[1123.22 → 1124.94] the review of the RTX 3080
[1124.94 → 1126.92] glossed over RTX
[1126.92 → 1128.14] okay
[1128.14 → 1129.04] I would say
[1129.04 → 1129.30] that
[1129.30 → 1130.64] we
[1130.64 → 1131.88] would have covered
[1131.88 → 1132.74] it in more depth
[1132.74 → 1133.56] than Steve did
[1133.56 → 1134.62] but that's all I can
[1134.62 → 1135.28] say about that
[1135.28 → 1137.02] he made it clear
[1137.02 → 1137.80] that there was going
[1137.80 → 1138.72] to be a follow-up
[1138.72 → 1140.16] dedicated piece
[1140.16 → 1140.80] of content
[1140.80 → 1142.38] for RTX
[1142.38 → 1143.36] then
[1143.36 → 1144.54] true to his word
[1144.54 → 1145.42] he created
[1145.42 → 1146.14] that dedicated
[1146.14 → 1147.10] piece of content
[1147.10 → 1147.88] Tim from his team
[1147.88 → 1148.70] hosted what I thought
[1148.70 → 1150.14] was an excellent video
[1150.14 → 1151.06] based on numbers
[1151.06 → 1152.34] that Steve had run
[1152.34 → 1153.42] about RTX
[1153.42 → 1154.80] it included
[1154.80 → 1156.30] commentary on performance
[1156.30 → 1157.62] it included commentary
[1157.62 → 1159.18] on the
[1159.18 → 1161.02] the generational
[1161.02 → 1161.66] improvement
[1161.66 → 1163.54] over the RTX 20 series
[1163.54 → 1164.88] it included commentary
[1164.88 → 1166.50] on how it looked
[1166.50 → 1168.58] and all actually positive
[1168.58 → 1169.60] even though that is
[1169.60 → 1170.44] not the point
[1170.44 → 1171.70] it doesn't matter
[1171.70 → 1172.80] that Nvidia is saying
[1172.80 → 1173.30] these things
[1173.30 → 1174.10] to someone who said
[1174.10 → 1174.70] negative things
[1174.70 → 1175.50] or positive things
[1175.50 → 1176.70] it's the principle
[1176.70 → 1177.70] so I don't want to
[1177.70 → 1178.64] get hung up on that
[1178.64 → 1180.06] but it was largely
[1180.06 → 1180.74] positive
[1180.74 → 1181.66] and
[1181.66 → 1182.22] had
[1182.22 → 1183.70] an enormous
[1183.70 → 1184.62] amount of emphasis
[1184.62 → 1185.88] on DLSS
[1185.88 → 1186.50] deep learning
[1186.50 → 1187.22] super sampling
[1187.22 → 1188.54] and went as far
[1188.54 → 1189.22] as to say
[1189.22 → 1190.62] basically
[1190.62 → 1192.54] any Nvidia gamer
[1192.54 → 1193.36] should turn on
[1193.36 → 1194.28] DLSS immediately
[1194.28 → 1195.12] because the image
[1195.12 → 1195.52] quality
[1195.52 → 1196.88] is so close
[1196.88 → 1197.42] to running
[1197.42 → 1198.28] at native resolution
[1198.28 → 1199.60] that was said
[1199.60 → 1200.44] on the hardware
[1200.44 → 1201.84] unboxed YouTube channel
[1201.84 → 1203.06] how can you
[1203.06 → 1204.22] possibly say
[1204.22 → 1205.24] that
[1205.24 → 1206.74] you have largely
[1206.74 → 1207.66] discounted
[1207.66 → 1208.82] all the other technologies
[1208.82 → 1209.82] we offer to gamers
[1209.82 → 1211.04] if they treat
[1211.04 → 1212.36] DLSS 2.0
[1212.36 → 1213.08] which is a lot better
[1213.08 → 1214.18] than DLSS 1.0
[1214.18 → 1215.00] which they rightly said
[1215.00 → 1215.44] was rubbish
[1215.44 → 1216.44] if they treat
[1216.44 → 1217.34] DLSS 2.0
[1217.34 → 1218.66] as a default
[1218.66 → 1220.42] as an obvious thing
[1220.42 → 1221.20] to turn on
[1221.20 → 1221.86] for gamers
[1221.86 → 1223.28] how can you say that
[1223.28 → 1224.12] it just doesn't even
[1224.12 → 1224.96] make any sense
[1224.96 → 1226.06] like this smells
[1226.06 → 1226.86] emotional
[1226.86 → 1227.98] not rational
[1227.98 → 1228.78] and then
[1228.78 → 1229.42] get this
[1229.42 → 1230.10] get this
[1230.10 → 1231.32] if I was a team
[1231.32 → 1232.30] red fanboy
[1232.30 → 1233.38] if I was that
[1233.38 → 1234.48] kind of degenerate
[1234.48 → 1235.24] and I was
[1235.24 → 1236.16] and I was watching
[1236.16 → 1237.18] hardware unboxed review
[1237.18 → 1238.56] of the 6900 XT
[1238.56 → 1239.04] okay
[1239.04 → 1240.20] and I saw
[1240.20 → 1241.52] DLSS results
[1241.52 → 1243.02] on the same chart
[1243.02 → 1244.46] on the same bar graph
[1244.46 → 1245.82] as AMD's
[1245.82 → 1246.34] native
[1246.34 → 1247.28] full resolution
[1247.28 → 1248.14] rendering results
[1248.14 → 1249.08] making NVIDIA
[1249.08 → 1250.20] look like they outperformed
[1250.20 → 1251.76] them by 30 freaking percent
[1251.76 → 1252.84] even though it's like
[1252.84 → 1253.72] machine learning
[1253.72 → 1254.68] AI trickery
[1254.68 → 1255.64] I would be
[1255.64 → 1256.56] I'd be
[1256.56 → 1257.72] I'd be beside myself
[1257.72 → 1258.48] I'd be screaming
[1258.48 → 1259.10] bloody murder
[1259.10 → 1259.86] and yet
[1259.86 → 1260.54] that's what
[1260.54 → 1261.46] hardware unboxed did
[1261.46 → 1262.84] they positioned
[1262.84 → 1264.34] DSS
[1264.34 → 1265.30] deep learning
[1265.30 → 1266.68] super sampling results
[1266.68 → 1267.68] as being
[1267.68 → 1268.84] equivalent
[1268.84 → 1269.66] to AMD
[1269.66 → 1270.38] having to render
[1270.38 → 1271.40] at full resolution
[1271.40 → 1271.86] and AMD
[1271.86 → 1272.90] obviously got
[1272.90 → 1273.60] absolutely
[1273.60 → 1274.82] annihilated
[1274.82 → 1276.12] in those tests
[1276.12 → 1277.38] because DLSS
[1277.38 → 1278.48] is great technology
[1278.48 → 1279.98] that's not the debate here
[1279.98 → 1281.34] the problem is that
[1281.34 → 1283.42] you
[1283.42 → 1284.52] you continue
[1284.52 → 1285.40] to focus
[1285.40 → 1286.44] singularly on
[1286.44 → 1287.50] rasterization performance
[1287.50 → 1288.32] and you have
[1288.32 → 1289.50] largely discounted
[1289.50 → 1290.54] all the other technologies
[1290.54 → 1291.28] we offer to gamers
[1291.28 → 1293.06] they didn't
[1293.06 → 1295.44] this
[1295.44 → 1296.52] this just sounds
[1296.52 → 1297.12] personal
[1297.12 → 1298.26] it is
[1298.26 → 1299.20] okay we're continuing
[1299.20 → 1300.74] two more lines
[1300.74 → 1301.10] I'm sorry
[1301.10 → 1301.40] I'm sorry
[1301.40 → 1301.94] let me
[1301.94 → 1303.88] let me just get this out
[1303.88 → 1305.08] it is very clear
[1305.08 → 1306.04] from your community
[1306.04 → 1306.58] commentary
[1306.58 → 1307.48] that you do not
[1307.48 → 1308.04] see things
[1308.04 → 1308.72] the same way
[1308.72 → 1309.32] that we
[1309.32 → 1310.30] gamers
[1310.30 → 1311.14] and the rest
[1311.14 → 1311.70] of the industry
[1311.70 → 1311.96] do
[1311.96 → 1312.60] how
[1312.60 → 1313.98] presumptuous
[1313.98 → 1314.90] of a thing
[1314.90 → 1315.48] to say
[1315.48 → 1316.00] is that
[1316.00 → 1316.92] who the
[1316.92 → 1317.88] are you
[1317.88 → 1320.84] I know
[1320.84 → 1322.18] who Brian Del Rizzo is
[1322.18 → 1323.14] and I know
[1323.14 → 1324.74] basically for a fact
[1324.74 → 1325.78] that he would
[1325.78 → 1326.42] never
[1326.42 → 1327.84] say those words
[1327.84 → 1328.94] in that order
[1328.94 → 1329.44] to
[1329.44 → 1330.92] f***ING anyone
[1330.92 → 1332.80] I
[1332.80 → 1333.20] at least
[1333.20 → 1334.12] I hope I know
[1334.12 → 1335.48] I have been trying
[1335.48 → 1336.12] to get in touch
[1336.12 → 1336.42] with him
[1336.42 → 1336.98] because I would
[1336.98 → 1337.72] really like to
[1337.72 → 1338.38] talk to him
[1338.38 → 1339.66] about this email
[1339.66 → 1340.74] and
[1340.74 → 1342.12] I'm not
[1342.12 → 1342.68] I'm not
[1342.68 → 1343.12] like
[1343.12 → 1343.60] look
[1343.60 → 1344.66] just because he
[1344.66 → 1345.20] hasn't gotten
[1345.20 → 1345.76] back to me
[1345.76 → 1346.86] I'm not drawing
[1346.86 → 1347.60] any conclusions
[1347.60 → 1348.44] based on that
[1348.44 → 1349.98] he's got a life
[1349.98 → 1350.48] okay
[1350.48 → 1351.34] he's got a life
[1351.34 → 1351.84] and
[1351.84 → 1352.66] I can't
[1352.66 → 1353.34] I'm not
[1353.34 → 1354.26] entitled to
[1354.26 → 1354.90] an immediate
[1354.90 → 1356.06] 30-second response
[1356.06 → 1356.90] anytime I'm upset
[1356.90 → 1357.48] about something
[1357.48 → 1358.00] that's not how
[1358.00 → 1358.50] this works
[1358.50 → 1359.28] so I'm
[1359.28 → 1360.38] I'm going to give him
[1360.38 → 1360.74] time
[1360.74 → 1361.80] but I need
[1361.80 → 1362.44] to talk to
[1362.44 → 1363.24] Brian about this
[1363.24 → 1364.28] because that
[1364.28 → 1366.12] that is not
[1366.12 → 1367.14] a
[1367.14 → 1367.78] that's not
[1367.78 → 1368.84] anyone's position
[1368.84 → 1369.22] to say
[1369.22 → 1370.52] if I said that
[1370.52 → 1371.62] if I said those words
[1371.62 → 1372.74] if I said to you
[1372.74 → 1373.12] Luke
[1373.12 → 1374.24] it's clear
[1374.24 → 1375.36] from community
[1375.36 → 1375.98] commentary
[1375.98 → 1376.86] that
[1376.86 → 1377.62] from your community
[1377.62 → 1378.08] commentary
[1378.08 → 1378.90] like your twitch
[1378.90 → 1379.52] stream chat
[1379.52 → 1379.94] or whatever
[1379.94 → 1380.54] it doesn't matter
[1380.54 → 1381.82] that you do not
[1381.82 → 1382.48] see things
[1382.48 → 1383.22] the same way
[1383.22 → 1384.14] that I
[1384.14 → 1384.80] gamers
[1384.80 → 1385.48] and the rest
[1385.48 → 1386.00] of the industry
[1386.00 → 1386.42] does
[1386.42 → 1389.22] excuse
[1389.22 → 1389.82] it doesn't matter
[1389.82 → 1390.66] who says that
[1390.66 → 1392.24] that is a ridiculous
[1392.24 → 1393.08] thing to say
[1393.08 → 1393.70] I don't necessarily
[1393.70 → 1394.36] immediately think
[1394.36 → 1394.98] you were wrong
[1394.98 → 1395.94] but I would
[1395.94 → 1396.76] immediately think
[1396.76 → 1397.22] that you were
[1397.22 → 1398.74] extremely presumptuous
[1398.74 → 1400.32] to at the very least
[1400.32 → 1400.94] include yourself
[1400.94 → 1401.88] in the other categories
[1401.88 → 1403.10] another thing
[1403.10 → 1403.74] that's very weird
[1403.74 → 1404.36] here is that
[1404.36 → 1405.12] I think you and I
[1405.12 → 1406.28] both in the past
[1406.28 → 1406.70] have
[1406.70 → 1407.78] I wouldn't necessarily
[1407.78 → 1408.70] say defended
[1408.70 → 1409.50] but
[1409.50 → 1414.62] made sure we were
[1414.62 → 1415.12] a little bit more
[1415.12 → 1415.48] careful
[1415.48 → 1416.88] when dealing
[1416.88 → 1417.40] with things
[1417.40 → 1417.88] from
[1417.88 → 1419.38] Mr. BDR
[1419.38 → 1420.18] because
[1420.18 → 1422.38] having dealt
[1422.38 → 1422.88] with him
[1422.88 → 1423.88] like directly
[1423.88 → 1424.50] in person
[1424.50 → 1425.38] a decent amount
[1425.38 → 1426.14] he's generally
[1426.14 → 1427.28] very reasonable
[1427.28 → 1427.82] yep
[1427.82 → 1429.20] like
[1429.20 → 1429.48] like
[1429.48 → 1430.34] very
[1430.34 → 1430.78] very
[1430.78 → 1431.28] reasonable
[1431.28 → 1431.80] and very
[1431.80 → 1432.08] easy
[1432.08 → 1432.42] to work
[1432.42 → 1432.58] with
[1432.58 → 1432.74] and
[1432.74 → 1433.12] that
[1433.12 → 1433.76] has been
[1433.76 → 1434.94] seeing his name
[1434.94 → 1435.26] at the bottom
[1435.26 → 1435.66] of this email
[1435.66 → 1436.56] was singularly
[1436.56 → 1437.32] the most surprising
[1437.32 → 1438.00] thing about this
[1438.00 → 1438.98] entire process
[1438.98 → 1439.40] to me
[1439.40 → 1439.68] person
[1439.68 → 1441.92] okay
[1441.92 → 1443.44] let's go on
[1443.44 → 1446.06] our founders' edition
[1446.06 → 1447.10] boards and other
[1447.10 → 1447.92] NVIDIA products
[1447.92 → 1449.02] are being allocated
[1449.02 → 1450.16] to media outlets
[1450.16 → 1450.90] that recognize
[1450.90 → 1451.58] the changing
[1451.58 → 1452.12] landscape
[1452.12 → 1452.86] of gaming
[1452.86 → 1453.66] and the features
[1453.66 → 1454.24] that are important
[1454.24 → 1454.80] to gamers
[1454.80 → 1455.28] and anyone
[1455.28 → 1455.98] buying a GPU
[1455.98 → 1456.42] today
[1456.42 → 1456.92] be it for
[1456.92 → 1457.20] gaming
[1457.20 → 1458.00] content creation
[1458.00 → 1458.62] or studio
[1458.62 → 1459.28] and streaming
[1459.28 → 1461.24] that recognize
[1461.24 → 1461.96] the changing
[1461.96 → 1462.38] landscape
[1462.38 → 1463.20] so this
[1463.20 → 1463.82] is just
[1463.82 → 1464.78] mafia speak
[1464.78 → 1465.30] for
[1465.30 → 1466.76] it would sure
[1466.76 → 1467.56] be a shame
[1467.56 → 1468.58] if anything
[1468.58 → 1469.38] happened to your
[1469.38 → 1470.00] nice little
[1470.00 → 1470.96] media outlet
[1470.96 → 1471.38] here
[1471.38 → 1472.50] because we would
[1472.50 → 1473.20] hate for
[1473.20 → 1474.32] our founders' edition
[1474.32 → 1475.24] boards to stop
[1475.24 → 1475.88] making their way
[1475.88 → 1476.60] into your hands
[1476.60 → 1477.26] except
[1477.26 → 1478.46] this is the point
[1478.46 → 1479.26] in the
[1479.26 → 1479.84] you know
[1479.84 → 1480.78] in the Don's
[1480.78 → 1481.80] communication
[1481.80 → 1482.56] to you
[1482.56 → 1483.16] where you're
[1483.16 → 1484.12] already having
[1484.12 → 1484.90] your knees
[1484.90 → 1485.32] broken
[1485.32 → 1487.84] now this
[1487.84 → 1488.34] next bit
[1488.34 → 1489.14] this next bit
[1489.14 → 1490.02] is
[1490.02 → 1491.90] a big load
[1491.90 → 1492.38] of bull
[1492.38 → 1493.18] in a way
[1493.18 → 1493.86] that I think
[1493.86 → 1494.58] most of you
[1494.58 → 1495.62] would not properly
[1495.62 → 1496.24] understand
[1496.24 → 1497.34] without the context
[1497.34 → 1497.92] that I'm going
[1497.92 → 1498.64] to give to you
[1498.64 → 1499.94] because it sounds
[1499.94 → 1501.08] pretty conciliatory
[1501.08 → 1502.54] it sounds like
[1502.54 → 1503.36] an olive branch
[1503.36 → 1504.22] but it's actually
[1504.22 → 1505.10] the complete
[1505.10 → 1505.90] opposite
[1505.90 → 1508.02] hardware unboxed
[1508.02 → 1508.74] should continue
[1508.74 → 1509.34] to work with
[1509.34 → 1510.32] our add-in card
[1510.32 → 1510.80] partners
[1510.80 → 1511.48] to secure
[1511.48 → 1512.12] GPUs
[1512.12 → 1512.62] to review
[1512.62 → 1513.88] of course
[1513.88 → 1514.62] you will still
[1514.62 → 1515.18] have access
[1515.18 → 1515.72] to obtain
[1515.72 → 1516.20] pre-release
[1516.20 → 1516.58] drivers
[1516.58 → 1517.22] and press
[1517.22 → 1517.68] materials
[1517.68 → 1518.92] that won't
[1518.92 → 1519.40] change
[1519.40 → 1521.10] no
[1521.10 → 1522.40] that is actually
[1522.40 → 1523.50] not how that
[1523.50 → 1523.80] works
[1523.80 → 1525.04] let's talk about
[1525.04 → 1525.42] this
[1525.42 → 1527.38] let's do the last
[1527.38 → 1527.90] line first
[1527.90 → 1528.44] we are opening
[1528.44 → 1529.36] to we are open
[1529.36 → 1530.10] to revisiting this
[1530.10 → 1530.54] in the future
[1530.54 → 1530.90] should your
[1530.90 → 1531.68] editorial direction
[1531.68 → 1532.14] change
[1532.14 → 1533.26] that's just like
[1533.26 → 1534.02] go yourself
[1534.02 → 1535.24] okay
[1535.24 → 1536.26] so back to
[1536.26 → 1536.96] they should continue
[1536.96 → 1537.42] to work with
[1537.42 → 1538.04] our add-in board
[1538.04 → 1538.32] partners
[1538.32 → 1539.36] and why this
[1539.36 → 1540.26] is such nonsense
[1540.26 → 1541.06] yeah
[1541.06 → 1542.84] this
[1542.84 → 1544.42] is the first
[1544.42 → 1545.04] basically
[1545.04 → 1546.38] we've seen this
[1546.38 → 1547.08] we've seen this
[1547.08 → 1547.56] from NVIDIA
[1547.56 → 1548.72] over a long
[1548.72 → 1549.40] period of time
[1549.40 → 1550.54] NVIDIA has exerted
[1550.54 → 1551.70] more and more
[1551.70 → 1552.78] control over their
[1552.78 → 1553.48] own narrative
[1553.48 → 1554.34] in the time that
[1554.34 → 1555.06] I've been in this
[1555.06 → 1555.46] industry
[1555.46 → 1557.56] so if this
[1557.56 → 1558.44] is the first
[1558.44 → 1559.10] bullet
[1559.10 → 1559.98] if this is the
[1559.98 → 1561.30] actual first
[1561.30 → 1562.10] execution
[1562.10 → 1563.50] that they have
[1563.50 → 1564.02] performed
[1564.02 → 1565.42] we've been watching
[1565.42 → 1566.26] them suit up
[1566.26 → 1567.28] and fill their
[1567.28 → 1567.70] magazines
[1567.70 → 1568.68] and put on
[1568.68 → 1569.46] the trench coat
[1569.46 → 1570.78] and be in the
[1570.78 → 1571.24] white room
[1571.24 → 1571.72] with all the
[1571.72 → 1572.04] guns
[1572.04 → 1572.76] and fill bags
[1572.76 → 1573.26] with them
[1573.26 → 1573.62] you know
[1573.62 → 1573.96] we're talking
[1573.96 → 1574.90] matrix references
[1574.90 → 1575.42] at this point
[1575.42 → 1576.44] we've been watching
[1576.44 → 1577.22] this take place
[1577.22 → 1577.86] over the last
[1577.86 → 1578.44] five years
[1578.44 → 1579.52] this is not
[1579.52 → 1580.96] this is not
[1580.96 → 1581.52] necessarily
[1581.52 → 1582.74] a surprise
[1582.74 → 1584.04] but this is
[1584.04 → 1584.82] by far the
[1584.82 → 1585.98] most brazen
[1585.98 → 1586.84] step they've
[1586.84 → 1587.42] taken in this
[1587.42 → 1587.76] direction
[1587.76 → 1588.46] and the danger
[1588.46 → 1589.38] is that
[1589.38 → 1590.16] this is the
[1590.16 → 1590.98] first domino
[1590.98 → 1591.50] in what is
[1591.50 → 1592.32] potentially a
[1592.32 → 1593.08] catastrophic
[1593.08 → 1593.94] chain reaction
[1593.94 → 1594.66] NVIDIA
[1594.66 → 1596.32] is not just
[1596.32 → 1598.12] not sending
[1598.12 → 1599.08] free shit
[1599.08 → 1599.60] to someone
[1599.60 → 1600.04] okay
[1600.04 → 1601.38] what they have
[1601.38 → 1601.76] done
[1601.76 → 1602.84] here effectively
[1602.84 → 1603.60] is because
[1603.60 → 1604.16] they have
[1604.16 → 1604.72] exerted an
[1604.72 → 1605.76] increasingly high
[1605.76 → 1606.72] level of control
[1606.72 → 1607.48] over board
[1607.48 → 1608.44] partner sampling
[1608.44 → 1610.04] what they are
[1610.04 → 1610.76] effectively
[1610.76 → 1611.46] just in a
[1611.46 → 1612.10] roundabout way
[1612.10 → 1612.44] doing
[1612.44 → 1613.80] is cutting off
[1613.80 → 1614.60] hardware unbox
[1614.60 → 1615.06] ability
[1615.06 → 1616.32] to do launch
[1616.32 → 1617.06] day reviews
[1617.06 → 1618.06] without having
[1618.06 → 1618.72] to just say
[1618.72 → 1619.26] that outright
[1619.26 → 1620.64] like we saw
[1620.64 → 1620.96] this
[1620.96 → 1621.78] we saw
[1621.78 → 1622.10] this
[1622.10 → 1622.62] I forget
[1622.62 → 1622.96] if it was
[1622.96 → 1623.56] 3080 or
[1623.56 → 1624.08] 3090
[1624.08 → 1624.64] but there was
[1624.64 → 1625.60] a two day
[1625.60 → 1626.48] later embargo
[1626.48 → 1627.44] for partner
[1627.44 → 1627.98] cards
[1627.98 → 1628.92] two days
[1628.92 → 1629.24] later
[1629.24 → 1630.32] so effectively
[1630.32 → 1631.26] hardware unbox
[1631.26 → 1632.62] would not be
[1632.62 → 1633.68] able to cover
[1633.68 → 1634.90] a GeForce card
[1634.90 → 1635.70] at launch
[1635.70 → 1636.90] now why
[1636.90 → 1637.62] would NVIDIA
[1637.62 → 1638.62] be after that
[1638.62 → 1639.54] unless they had
[1639.54 → 1640.66] something to fear
[1640.66 → 1641.62] from hardware
[1641.62 → 1642.70] unboxed covering
[1642.70 → 1643.26] their product
[1643.26 → 1644.00] at launch
[1644.00 → 1645.26] unless they felt
[1645.26 → 1645.80] like hardware
[1645.80 → 1646.34] unboxed was
[1646.34 → 1647.18] somehow a threat
[1647.18 → 1647.78] to their ability
[1647.78 → 1648.30] to sell their
[1648.30 → 1648.70] product
[1648.70 → 1649.76] Luke what is
[1649.76 → 1650.38] that face you're
[1650.38 → 1650.86] making what's
[1650.86 → 1651.38] going on over
[1651.38 → 1651.58] there
[1651.58 → 1652.18] you have to
[1652.18 → 1652.76] see this
[1652.76 → 1654.30] float plane chat
[1654.30 → 1654.84] was spamming
[1654.84 → 1655.04] this
[1655.04 → 1655.54] I'm assuming
[1655.54 → 1656.08] to me
[1656.08 → 1656.56] because they
[1656.56 → 1657.00] know that I
[1657.00 → 1657.56] read float plane
[1657.56 → 1657.94] chat during
[1657.94 → 1658.34] the show
[1658.34 → 1660.90] you guys can
[1660.90 → 1661.54] stop spamming
[1661.54 → 1661.92] it now
[1661.92 → 1663.74] but holy
[1663.74 → 1664.56] cow
[1664.56 → 1666.90] like what
[1666.90 → 1667.66] the heck
[1667.66 → 1668.24] what is this
[1668.24 → 1669.04] gotta be
[1669.04 → 1669.70] screen shared
[1669.70 → 1670.34] and you have to
[1670.34 → 1670.78] see it
[1670.78 → 1671.62] okay
[1671.62 → 1672.60] we'll get to
[1672.60 → 1672.88] that
[1672.88 → 1673.58] we will get
[1673.58 → 1674.08] to that in a
[1674.08 → 1674.66] moment guys
[1674.66 → 1675.28] thank you for
[1675.28 → 1675.72] bringing that to
[1675.72 → 1676.18] my attention
[1676.18 → 1676.92] I'm not quite
[1676.92 → 1677.50] done with this
[1677.50 → 1677.82] thought
[1677.82 → 1678.40] give me a
[1678.40 → 1678.92] second here
[1678.92 → 1680.12] okay
[1680.12 → 1681.18] so this is
[1681.18 → 1681.82] about more
[1681.82 → 1682.28] than just
[1682.28 → 1682.68] money
[1682.68 → 1684.28] this is
[1684.28 → 1684.78] about
[1684.78 → 1685.86] Nvidia
[1685.86 → 1686.60] exerting
[1686.60 → 1687.84] control
[1687.84 → 1688.54] this is
[1688.54 → 1688.74] about
[1688.74 → 1689.08] Nvidia
[1689.08 → 1689.60] exerting
[1689.60 → 1690.38] control
[1690.38 → 1691.48] over what
[1691.48 → 1691.86] is said
[1691.86 → 1692.32] about their
[1692.32 → 1692.84] products
[1692.84 → 1693.72] without them
[1693.72 → 1694.06] saying it
[1694.06 → 1694.44] because you
[1694.44 → 1695.14] gotta understand
[1695.14 → 1696.38] at launch
[1696.38 → 1696.76] day
[1696.76 → 1697.28] what the
[1697.28 → 1697.86] curve looks
[1697.86 → 1698.42] like when
[1698.42 → 1698.82] you release
[1698.82 → 1699.24] a video
[1699.24 → 1699.74] or an
[1699.74 → 1700.04] article
[1700.04 → 1700.76] is like
[1700.76 → 1701.14] this
[1701.14 → 1702.04] huge
[1702.04 → 1703.38] and then
[1703.38 → 1704.60] exponential
[1704.60 → 1705.40] decrease
[1705.40 → 1706.14] in who is
[1706.14 → 1706.58] looking for
[1706.58 → 1707.32] information about
[1707.32 → 1707.86] this card
[1707.86 → 1708.96] you are doing
[1708.96 → 1710.20] way more
[1710.20 → 1711.06] than just
[1711.06 → 1711.90] telling hardware
[1711.90 → 1712.60] unbox look
[1712.60 → 1713.46] we don't
[1713.46 → 1713.84] think it's
[1713.84 → 1714.28] worth the
[1714.28 → 1715.38] six hundred
[1715.38 → 1715.98] dollars or
[1715.98 → 1716.42] whatever the
[1716.42 → 1717.52] actual bare
[1717.52 → 1718.72] board cost of
[1718.72 → 1719.38] this thing is
[1719.38 → 1720.60] to support you
[1720.60 → 1721.66] because you're
[1721.66 → 1722.66] hurting hardware
[1722.66 → 1723.36] unbox in a lot
[1723.36 → 1723.68] of ways
[1723.68 → 1724.54] hardware unbox is
[1724.54 → 1725.54] positioned as a
[1725.54 → 1726.40] source for
[1726.40 → 1727.20] quick content
[1727.20 → 1727.78] so yeah
[1727.78 → 1728.52] you're affecting
[1728.52 → 1729.02] their money
[1729.02 → 1729.50] because they're
[1729.50 → 1729.94] not going to get
[1729.94 → 1730.48] as many views
[1730.48 → 1731.02] so sure
[1731.02 → 1731.82] but you're also
[1731.82 → 1732.52] affecting their
[1732.52 → 1733.02] brand
[1733.02 → 1734.60] a big part
[1734.60 → 1735.34] of the trust
[1735.34 → 1735.96] that a media
[1735.96 → 1737.00] outlet has
[1737.00 → 1737.38] with their
[1737.38 → 1737.74] audience
[1737.74 → 1738.50] is being a
[1738.50 → 1739.58] timely accurate
[1739.58 → 1740.14] source of
[1740.14 → 1740.50] content
[1740.50 → 1741.70] so you
[1741.70 → 1742.38] are either
[1742.38 → 1742.98] hurting their
[1742.98 → 1743.50] timeliness
[1743.50 → 1744.66] you're hurting
[1744.66 → 1745.38] their accuracy
[1745.38 → 1746.38] if they rush
[1746.38 → 1747.70] or you are
[1747.70 → 1748.24] hurting them
[1748.24 → 1749.06] personally
[1749.06 → 1749.90] you are hurting
[1749.90 → 1750.64] their life
[1750.64 → 1752.20] because if you
[1752.20 → 1752.70] don't give
[1752.70 → 1753.66] Steve the same
[1753.66 → 1754.50] amount of time
[1754.50 → 1755.10] hardware unbox
[1755.10 → 1755.50] Steve not
[1755.50 → 1756.04] gamers next to
[1756.04 → 1756.20] Steve
[1756.20 → 1757.00] if you don't
[1757.00 → 1757.42] give Steve
[1757.42 → 1757.88] from hardware
[1757.88 → 1758.80] unbox the same
[1758.80 → 1759.40] amount of time
[1759.40 → 1759.96] to cover the
[1759.96 → 1760.92] product as his
[1760.92 → 1761.62] competitors in
[1761.62 → 1762.10] the industry
[1762.10 → 1763.64] he either has
[1763.64 → 1764.20] to sacrifice
[1764.20 → 1766.38] money by just
[1766.38 → 1767.22] publishing later
[1767.22 → 1768.58] accuracy of the
[1768.58 → 1769.80] content by rushing
[1769.80 → 1771.40] or his sleep
[1771.40 → 1772.50] his actual life
[1772.50 → 1773.24] spending time
[1773.24 → 1773.50] with the
[1773.50 → 1773.84] I don't even
[1773.84 → 1774.24] know I don't
[1774.24 → 1774.70] know the guy
[1774.70 → 1775.30] maybe he has
[1775.30 → 1775.92] kids I don't
[1775.92 → 1776.34] know it doesn't
[1776.34 → 1776.86] matter to me
[1776.86 → 1777.62] the point is
[1777.62 → 1778.30] he might not
[1778.30 → 1779.12] get to actually
[1779.12 → 1779.96] play the video
[1779.96 → 1780.70] games that he's
[1780.70 → 1781.30] making videos
[1781.30 → 1781.94] about he might
[1781.94 → 1782.58] not get to see
[1782.58 → 1783.72] his family or
[1783.72 → 1784.28] children or
[1784.28 → 1784.76] whatever it is
[1784.76 → 1785.92] you are actually
[1785.92 → 1787.20] affecting his
[1787.20 → 1788.58] life in that
[1788.58 → 1789.50] way, and I'm
[1789.50 → 1790.38] not saying you
[1790.38 → 1791.28] have to send
[1791.28 → 1791.94] him a card
[1791.94 → 1793.46] I'm saying that
[1793.46 → 1794.78] what you're doing
[1794.78 → 1795.36] is
[1795.36 → 1796.54] is
[1796.54 → 1796.98] is
[1796.98 → 1797.98] the reasoning
[1797.98 → 1798.66] for it and
[1798.66 → 1799.08] what you're
[1799.08 → 1799.98] doing is a
[1799.98 → 1801.30] lot bigger than
[1801.30 → 1802.12] what that last
[1802.12 → 1803.22] paragraph makes
[1803.22 → 1804.54] it seems like
[1804.54 → 1805.78] and there are
[1805.78 → 1806.46] bigger problems
[1806.46 → 1806.94] here too
[1806.94 → 1808.32] this sends a
[1808.32 → 1809.08] message to other
[1809.08 → 1810.08] media like me
[1810.08 → 1811.36] you better get
[1811.36 → 1811.92] on board with
[1811.92 → 1813.10] ray tracing or
[1813.10 → 1813.52] else
[1813.52 → 1816.04] I heard that
[1816.04 → 1817.20] loud and clear
[1817.20 → 1818.02] it was a dog
[1818.02 → 1818.80] whistle, but I'm
[1818.80 → 1819.32] not an idiot
[1819.32 → 1820.84] I understood it
[1820.84 → 1821.60] absolutely
[1821.60 → 1823.36] you better make
[1823.36 → 1824.02] sure you get on
[1824.02 → 1824.50] board with
[1824.50 → 1825.56] Nvidia's vision
[1825.56 → 1826.64] for the direction
[1826.64 → 1827.22] of the gaming
[1827.22 → 1828.38] industry or
[1828.38 → 1829.20] else we are
[1829.20 → 1830.08] going to affect
[1830.08 → 1831.10] either your
[1831.10 → 1832.50] money or the
[1832.50 → 1833.22] quality of your
[1833.22 → 1834.50] content or your
[1834.50 → 1835.14] life we're gonna
[1835.14 → 1835.88] affect that
[1835.88 → 1837.40] now arguably this
[1837.40 → 1837.90] was a private
[1837.90 → 1839.40] email but if
[1839.40 → 1840.06] you're going to
[1840.06 → 1840.78] with a straight
[1840.78 → 1841.88] face tell me
[1841.88 → 1842.78] that you didn't
[1842.78 → 1843.50] expect this to
[1843.50 → 1844.46] leak immediately
[1844.46 → 1845.84] either you're
[1845.84 → 1846.96] stupid or you
[1846.96 → 1847.68] think I am
[1847.68 → 1849.48] because this is
[1849.48 → 1851.00] hardware unboxed
[1851.00 → 1852.36] you'd have to be a
[1852.36 → 1853.22] complete idiot
[1853.22 → 1854.16] no offence I'm
[1854.16 → 1854.84] using very strong
[1854.84 → 1855.50] language here because
[1855.50 → 1856.08] it's appropriate
[1856.08 → 1857.18] you'd have to be a
[1857.18 → 1858.94] complete idiot to
[1858.94 → 1859.52] think that this will
[1859.52 → 1860.52] not get immediately
[1860.52 → 1862.34] published so you're
[1862.34 → 1863.48] sending you're sending
[1863.48 → 1864.54] a message to
[1864.54 → 1865.74] consumers you're
[1865.74 → 1866.64] sending a message to
[1866.64 → 1867.44] hardware unboxed
[1867.44 → 1868.22] you're sending a
[1868.22 → 1869.06] message to other
[1869.06 → 1870.54] media don't kid
[1870.54 → 1870.98] yourself
[1870.98 → 1873.82] furthermore what
[1873.82 → 1875.08] you're also doing is
[1875.08 → 1876.06] you're driving more
[1876.06 → 1877.04] of a divide between
[1877.04 → 1878.22] the toxic fan bases
[1878.22 → 1879.48] that exist on both
[1879.48 → 1880.82] sides team red and
[1880.82 → 1881.78] team green quite
[1881.78 → 1882.58] honestly I've made
[1882.58 → 1883.40] my position on this
[1883.40 → 1884.46] clear if you're a
[1884.46 → 1885.64] fanboy if you don't
[1885.64 → 1886.12] look at things
[1886.12 → 1886.94] objectively if you
[1886.94 → 1888.24] don't even try you're
[1888.24 → 1889.90] an idiot that's all
[1889.90 → 1891.22] there is to it being
[1891.22 → 1892.76] a fanboy of any
[1892.76 → 1894.00] corporation be it
[1894.00 → 1895.84] Apple Google Nvidia
[1895.84 → 1897.16] AMD it doesn't
[1897.16 → 1898.06] matter it doesn't
[1898.06 → 1901.62] matter okay stop just
[1901.62 → 1903.22] stop so what Nvidia
[1903.22 → 1904.54] is doing is they're
[1904.54 → 1906.24] driving even more of
[1906.24 → 1908.02] a wedge here how am I
[1908.02 → 1909.06] supposed to continue
[1909.06 → 1910.28] to cover real-time
[1910.28 → 1911.32] ray tracing how am I
[1911.32 → 1911.88] supposed to cover
[1911.88 → 1913.52] RTX it happens to be a
[1913.52 → 1914.60] feature that I like and
[1914.60 → 1915.64] I think is really cool
[1915.64 → 1916.70] and I do happen to
[1916.70 → 1918.12] believe is the future
[1918.12 → 1919.40] of lighting and gaming
[1919.40 → 1921.06] as GPUs continue to get
[1921.06 → 1921.86] more and more powerful
[1921.86 → 1923.50] I happen to actually
[1923.50 → 1924.84] think that but now
[1924.84 → 1926.02] what you're going to do
[1926.02 → 1926.98] is you're going you are
[1926.98 → 1928.34] effectively branding
[1928.34 → 1929.78] you're effectively
[1929.78 → 1930.74] branding hardware
[1930.74 → 1932.96] unboxed as like you
[1932.96 → 1934.70] know a team red media
[1934.70 → 1935.68] outlet because they're
[1935.68 → 1937.60] not no they're not fair
[1937.60 → 1939.16] to me this media doesn't
[1939.16 → 1940.42] cover me fairly who do
[1940.42 → 1942.26] you sound like you got
[1942.26 → 1943.06] to decide who you want
[1943.06 → 1944.60] to sound like okay
[1944.60 → 1946.28] because you're branding
[1946.28 → 1947.86] them as red media and
[1947.86 → 1948.74] than what you're doing
[1948.74 → 1950.88] effectively because if you
[1950.88 → 1952.46] actually have any idea
[1952.46 → 1954.02] what your job is if you're
[1954.02 → 1955.06] in public relations if you
[1955.06 → 1956.34] actually have no anything
[1956.34 → 1958.30] about public relations is
[1958.30 → 1959.30] you are engaging with the
[1959.30 → 1960.94] public to create this
[1960.94 → 1962.30] divide so you're going to
[1962.30 → 1963.30] create a divide where
[1963.30 → 1964.78] hardware unboxed is now red
[1964.78 → 1965.86] media, and it's going to get
[1965.86 → 1967.12] attacked for that, and you're
[1967.12 → 1968.22] creating a divide where all
[1968.22 → 1969.10] of a sudden just because I
[1969.10 → 1970.60] happen to think RTX is good
[1970.60 → 1973.12] I'm now green media, and I'm
[1973.12 → 1973.82] going to get called an
[1973.82 → 1975.36] Nvidia shill just because I
[1975.36 → 1976.34] happen to agree with you
[1976.34 → 1978.04] because you sent out a dog
[1978.04 → 1979.36] whistle that said you agree
[1979.36 → 1980.40] with us about the direction of
[1980.40 → 1982.72] the industry or else that's
[1982.72 → 1985.72] what you did you either
[1985.72 → 1986.88] respect a free and
[1986.88 → 1988.26] independent media or you
[1988.26 → 1989.76] don't you don't get to
[1989.76 → 1993.68] selectively respect it so if
[1993.68 → 1995.36] you acknowledge that this is a
[1995.36 → 1997.50] difference of opinion and not
[1997.50 → 1999.14] objective fact if you don't
[1999.14 → 2000.84] have a smoking gun that says
[2000.84 → 2002.56] hardware unboxed is on the
[2002.56 → 2004.28] take from AMD and that's why
[2004.28 → 2005.68] they don't cover us fairly if
[2005.68 → 2007.44] you have nothing if you
[2007.44 → 2008.96] acknowledge what a stupid
[2008.96 → 2010.20] email to send like if I was
[2010.20 → 2011.12] going to be evil I'd be
[2011.12 → 2012.44] smarter about it if you
[2012.44 → 2014.82] acknowledge that there is that
[2014.82 → 2016.74] there is no reason for this
[2016.74 → 2018.02] other than a difference of
[2018.02 → 2020.58] opinion and that well we can
[2020.58 → 2022.26] fix that for you if you would
[2022.26 → 2024.76] just start towing the company
[2024.76 → 2026.52] line if you acknowledge that
[2026.52 → 2028.24] then you have stepped over the
[2028.24 → 2030.96] line you can't respect
[2030.96 → 2032.50] independent media and
[2032.50 → 2034.36] differences of opinion from
[2034.36 → 2036.70] one media outlet and not from
[2036.70 → 2038.52] another media outlet there is
[2038.52 → 2040.66] absolutely no gray area once you
[2040.66 → 2042.18] have crossed that line with one
[2042.18 → 2044.36] of us you've crossed it with all
[2044.36 → 2046.26] of us, and you've crossed it with
[2046.26 → 2049.44] your consumers this email is a
[2049.44 → 2051.84] disaster it's an absolute
[2051.84 → 2054.00] disaster, and you want to know
[2054.00 → 2057.32] why because it reads like every
[2057.32 → 2062.44] pathetic toxic fanboy wet dream of
[2062.44 → 2065.90] how bad and evil Nvidia is and up
[2065.90 → 2068.28] until now up until now I have
[2068.28 → 2070.48] defended Nvidia at every turn I
[2070.48 → 2072.46] have said I even said last night in
[2072.46 → 2074.10] my first response to this tweet I
[2074.10 → 2076.10] said that really doesn't sound like
[2076.10 → 2078.26] the Nvidia that I know I have
[2078.26 → 2080.40] defended you guys and time and
[2080.40 → 2082.44] time again the allegations haven't
[2082.44 → 2085.84] been true but this time it's right
[2085.84 → 2088.44] from your own hand you went
[2088.44 → 2090.50] you went and said okay well there's
[2090.50 → 2093.00] this perception of us as you know
[2093.00 → 2096.36] like the big bad green monster, so I'm
[2096.36 → 2098.30] going to go ahead I'm a'm a growth a
[2098.30 → 2099.94] little goatee and little moustache
[2099.94 → 2101.18] like I'm going to grow a little Hitler
[2101.18 → 2103.04] moustache or something I'm going to put
[2103.04 → 2105.36] on a put on a monocle I'm a ride
[2105.36 → 2108.02] around in a Zeppelin, and I'm gonna
[2108.02 → 2111.00] play the part you just made every
[2111.00 → 2114.40] team red AMD fanboys dream come true
[2114.40 → 2117.22] because now when they come after me or
[2117.22 → 2119.20] anyone who says a bloody positive
[2119.20 → 2120.92] thing about you, they're going to have
[2120.92 → 2126.02] real actual ammunition way to go
[2126.02 → 2128.02] oh
[2128.02 → 2133.06] intermission time for the picture
[2133.06 → 2136.38] for what for the uh what I sent
[2136.38 → 2139.98] you on discord yeah sure because I
[2139.98 → 2141.68] think that's still important to get
[2141.68 → 2142.84] through when you're still pissed off
[2142.84 → 2144.86] because this is actually kind of fine
[2144.86 → 2147.60] incredibly insulting give me a second
[2147.60 → 2150.18] yeah the best part of all of this
[2150.18 → 2152.64] just quite possibly the stupidest part
[2152.64 → 2154.12] of all of this so here's a link from
[2154.12 → 2155.60] web archive for all I know it's still
[2155.60 → 2157.88] live though um let's go ahead and
[2157.88 → 2159.20] screen share with me let's screen
[2159.20 → 2161.08] share with me, and it's not about this
[2161.08 → 2163.92] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if
[2163.92 → 2166.60] hardware unboxed like covered it
[2166.60 → 2168.76] positively or negatively the problem is
[2168.76 → 2171.60] the precedent but lets uh head over to
[2171.60 → 2174.36] Wayback Machine uh by the way wayback
[2174.36 → 2176.82] machine is awesome and if you guys do
[2176.82 → 2178.14] feel like supporting them you should
[2178.14 → 2179.78] totally do that because the work that
[2179.78 → 2181.66] they do is incredibly important for
[2181.66 → 2185.74] things like this um here we go so
[2185.74 → 2187.62] here are media impressions of NVIDIA
[2187.62 → 2189.52] DSS one of the technologies that
[2189.52 → 2191.74] NVIDIA has gone and invested a lot in
[2191.74 → 2195.24] the real deal forbs what else we got
[2195.24 → 2197.56] here come on carousel show me what you
[2197.56 → 2200.50] got extremely impressive hardware
[2200.50 → 2205.78] unboxed literally the first bullet point
[2205.78 → 2209.18] in your marketing on your DSS page
[2209.18 → 2214.10] but yeah they definitely aren't aligned
[2214.10 → 2217.26] and are uh not following the rest of the
[2217.26 → 2219.68] industry and gamers and everyone else
[2219.68 → 2221.72] that follows NVIDIA definitely not at
[2221.72 → 2224.10] all, but we're going to use them for
[2224.10 → 2225.62] marketing on our website thanks
[2225.62 → 2228.22] yeah yeah but we didn't get anything
[2228.22 → 2229.82] out of this transaction where we send
[2229.82 → 2231.16] them a graphics card oh no
[2231.16 → 2234.94] no there's no possible benefit you're
[2234.94 → 2236.48] just doing it out of greed because you
[2236.48 → 2238.44] want free graphics cards or something
[2238.44 → 2240.72] worth this entire freaking and you
[2240.72 → 2242.86] don't respect you know the real gamers
[2242.86 → 2245.22] who really spend money on graphics cards
[2245.22 → 2247.84] no I don't know if you respect the real
[2247.84 → 2249.64] gamers who spend real money on graphics
[2249.64 → 2251.54] cards because that's the entire point
[2251.54 → 2253.64] of what we do making sure they spend
[2253.64 → 2255.80] their real money on graphics cards that
[2255.80 → 2258.16] are the best choice for them and maybe
[2258.16 → 2260.52] maybe Steve's opinion is that
[2260.52 → 2262.58] rasterization is more important today
[2262.58 → 2266.22] and he doesn't foresee RTX 30 series with
[2266.22 → 2268.84] the current you know roadmap of games
[2268.84 → 2272.58] that are coming out being you know more
[2272.58 → 2275.44] attractive for its RTX features maybe he
[2275.44 → 2278.92] doesn't that's his prerogative and if the
[2278.92 → 2281.20] gamers who follow him want to hear that
[2281.20 → 2282.90] perspective because that's what's important
[2282.90 → 2284.46] to them in the games that they play and they
[2284.46 → 2286.76] want to know how these products stack up
[2286.76 → 2289.52] with that perspective there is nothing
[2289.52 → 2291.22] wrong with that they're gamers too
[2291.22 → 2296.12] okay I don't know if I want to talk about
[2296.12 → 2297.78] this anymore I think I've said everything
[2297.78 → 2299.52] that I have to say there are some actual
[2299.52 → 2301.94] notes from Alex in the doc but I didn't
[2301.94 → 2302.94] really look at any of it
[2302.94 → 2307.50] um yeah that's all I have to say about
[2307.50 → 2310.44] that uh are you potentially interested in
[2310.44 → 2312.86] taking a bit of a go buy a mouse pad
[2312.86 → 2315.34] lttstore.com it's finally it's finally
[2315.34 → 2319.80] listed the northern lights mouse pad, and you know what while you're at it, I don't know what kind of
[2319.80 → 2324.26] merch hardware unboxed has but go buy some of that go buy a gamers nexus mod mat
[2324.26 → 2342.26] uh go buy uh what kind of crap does kyle have oh, oh he has a mouse pad uh don't buy his mouse pad buy other stuff from him buy my mouse pad um whatever buy his mouse pad too I don't even care the point is serving, but you can subscribe to kyle and hardware unboxed on float plane absolutely you can subscribe to Linus tech tips on float plane to support media because that is the only way that NVIDIA tactics like that is the only way that NVIDIA tactics like that is the only way that NVIDIA tactics like that is the only way that NVIDIA
[2342.26 → 2357.72] can have absolutely no impact other than to
[2357.72 → 2359.74] that is the only way that NVIDIA accordance with m exactly what you're showing
[2359.74 → 2363.54] that nvidiamesmu is exactly NOAA so stop stoppinghwa.com
[2364.18 → 2381.14] Rb infshkiejibus you know completely VA dragon
[2381.14 → 2384.28] is going to be to, you know, play your little game
[2384.28 → 2385.74] and cover it the way that you say,
[2385.94 → 2386.44] f*** you.
[2386.94 → 2388.04] That's all there is to it.
[2389.12 → 2390.30] I can live without you.
[2390.84 → 2391.54] Truly can.
[2393.66 → 2394.40] Now I'm done.
[2396.22 → 2396.84] For real.
[2397.46 → 2397.64] Okay?
[2398.10 → 2398.66] I want to talk about...
[2398.66 → 2399.42] Want to make it more fun?
[2399.74 → 2400.04] Yeah.
[2400.38 → 2400.78] Yes.
[2400.78 → 2400.86] This?
[2401.26 → 2401.78] Yes, I do.
[2402.18 → 2405.06] I want to talk about the collab today with Electro Boom.
[2405.64 → 2406.98] You know Electro Boom, right, Luke?
[2407.64 → 2408.04] Absolutely.
[2408.28 → 2410.16] I've watched that guy on YouTube forever.
[2410.16 → 2411.64] His content's fantastic.
[2412.32 → 2413.02] Love the message.
[2413.16 → 2413.74] Love the content.
[2413.88 → 2414.68] It's always been perfect.
[2415.80 → 2418.42] Mehdi is freaking amazing.
[2418.84 → 2422.50] So we had the idea of doing a video.
[2422.64 → 2423.94] It's sponsored by Sea sonic.
[2424.60 → 2427.74] So we kind of like to keep videos sort of on topic.
[2427.88 → 2429.22] I mean, Sea sonic is super chill.
[2429.62 → 2432.78] They literally buy a sponsor spot once a year
[2432.78 → 2435.54] just to like to say happy holidays to our audience.
[2436.36 → 2437.90] Literally no talking points.
[2437.90 → 2439.92] I'm not supposed to talk about the product at all.
[2440.16 → 2441.50] They're just like, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[2441.62 → 2441.86] It's chill.
[2442.14 → 2444.32] Just be like, you know, Merry Christmas or whatever.
[2444.46 → 2445.34] I'm like, okay, sure.
[2445.82 → 2446.98] Thanks, Sea sonic.
[2447.52 → 2448.86] So they're super chill.
[2449.08 → 2451.66] But on our side, we try to make it kind of make sense.
[2452.14 → 2454.28] And so because Sea sonic makes power supplies,
[2454.38 → 2457.16] we're like, oh, why don't we try and do like a power...
[2457.88 → 2460.82] Like, oh, why don't we do something around like electrostatic discharge?
[2460.82 → 2464.56] Because you see it time and time again in the YouTube comments.
[2464.74 → 2468.48] It's like, you know, oh, Linus isn't wearing an ESD strap or...
[2468.48 → 2473.06] Or, you know, make sure you're wearing an ESD strap or this or like your stuff's going to die.
[2473.30 → 2474.64] And that's true.
[2474.74 → 2476.32] But then we also see comments that are like,
[2476.38 → 2479.92] I've been building computers without ESD straps for 10 years, and it's never mattered.
[2479.92 → 2485.58] So we wanted to do a video that was like, okay, does ESD actually kill your hardware?
[2486.18 → 2488.64] And the answer is obviously yes.
[2488.88 → 2494.10] Or, you know, Intel could save a lot of money on like, you know,
[2494.30 → 2496.84] the building of their...
[2496.84 → 2500.24] The construction of their facilities if they didn't have to worry about it at all, right?
[2500.94 → 2503.04] And the improved resiliency of their motherboards
[2503.04 → 2505.56] because there's been a lot of development on that over the years.
[2505.56 → 2510.14] I'm sure ASUS would be more than happy to not bother to put any, you know,
[2510.28 → 2512.30] ESD protections on their motherboards, right?
[2513.84 → 2514.88] So it does.
[2515.02 → 2518.36] But what we wanted to know was, well, like, what are the odds, right?
[2518.98 → 2519.90] And I was...
[2519.90 → 2521.12] We're in the writer's meeting, and I'm like,
[2521.56 → 2524.84] man, I wish there wasn't a global pandemic right now
[2524.84 → 2528.20] because you know who I'd love to collab with on this is Electro Boom.
[2528.84 → 2531.32] And one of the guys, I think it was Colin, was like,
[2532.16 → 2533.58] you know, he lives in Burnaby, right?
[2533.58 → 2534.84] And I was like, what?
[2536.08 → 2536.80] Wait, what?
[2536.92 → 2538.28] Are you kidding me?
[2539.20 → 2539.96] It's really weird.
[2540.14 → 2542.16] Like, I don't know where else he would be,
[2542.26 → 2544.70] but like, it's just, it's always weird to figure out
[2544.70 → 2546.92] that someone's like hyper local, you know?
[2547.00 → 2547.36] Yeah.
[2547.84 → 2550.80] You always think like, it's the only group of people in town
[2550.80 → 2552.38] that are like doing this kind of stuff.
[2552.44 → 2553.78] And it's like, oh no, not at all.
[2553.84 → 2556.20] If I really wanted to, I could walk to his house.
[2556.78 → 2559.20] Like, it would take me a while, but like, I could.
[2559.20 → 2565.70] And so, so, cause, cause part of his shtick is that he gives just a
[2565.80 → 2570.44] he's a wealth of information about electrical engineering and electronics.
[2570.44 → 2577.52] And he, he has this amazing, just utterly unique educational style where he,
[2577.52 → 2584.04] he shows you what to do or explains what to do by demonstrating so often what not to do.
[2584.04 → 2589.06] And the more, the more you watch the content, the more fun it is to watch,
[2589.06 → 2595.40] because the more anticipation you have for how he's about to, you know, physically harm himself.
[2596.06 → 2603.90] And can I just say that I have had the pleasure of meeting a ton of absolutely wonderful individuals
[2603.90 → 2608.46] in the YouTube community, you know, to, to name just a few of them.
[2608.46 → 2608.80] Okay.
[2609.12 → 2617.64] Nico from Corridor Digital, Justine from Justine, you know, Marquez, Lou from Unbox Therapy,
[2617.94 → 2623.02] Dave, Dave2D, Austin Evans, like Jay, Steve from Gamers Nexus.
[2623.02 → 2628.00] Like this is an amazing community, both YouTube and tech and tech YouTube, whatever.
[2628.68 → 2635.62] Almost everyone I've met is just freaking awesome and like cool and genuine and real.
[2635.84 → 2636.78] Like not fake.
[2636.84 → 2637.84] I hate fake people.
[2637.84 → 2643.98] I can't stand it drives me up the wall, but just real people who just happened to get into YouTube
[2643.98 → 2648.84] and like, yeah, I guess they're famous now or whatever, but they're still chill.
[2648.98 → 2650.16] They're still just real people.
[2650.72 → 2655.06] And I have never been disappointed to meet any of them.
[2655.14 → 2660.46] It's never like, oh, wow, you were, you were like way cooler in the videos.
[2660.46 → 2663.38] Like, wow, you're kind of a you're kind of a or whatever.
[2663.54 → 2665.48] Like it's, I've never felt like that.
[2665.48 → 2672.40] People's onscreen personas have basically led me to believe what ended up being true about who they are.
[2672.40 → 2683.32] But I have never met anyone who in person was exactly as funny and genuine and cool as Mehdi.
[2683.66 → 2684.02] Okay.
[2684.02 → 2686.16] He was flipping awesome.
[2686.16 → 2686.72] That's awesome.
[2687.32 → 2690.38] And I just, I really enjoyed working with him today.
[2690.48 → 2691.54] It was an absolute pleasure.
[2691.88 → 2693.56] And the video is going to be awesome.
[2693.64 → 2694.84] He's going to have a video on his channel.
[2695.02 → 2697.06] Make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it.
[2697.06 → 2699.10] That's all I have to say about that.
[2699.14 → 2710.52] I don't want to spoil it, but if you know anything about Electro Boom, then you'll probably already know that there's going to be a lot of me getting shocked with electricity.
[2711.10 → 2713.88] And there's going to be a lot of him getting shocked.
[2714.28 → 2716.92] And there's going to be a lot of us shocking each other.
[2716.92 → 2723.56] And there's definitely going to be dead hardware because the subject of the video is, can ESD kill your components?
[2723.74 → 2726.20] And we all already know that the answer is yes.
[2728.04 → 2728.64] Very cool.
[2728.74 → 2729.28] That's exciting.
[2730.58 → 2731.34] It's going to be good.
[2731.62 → 2734.66] Now we've got a topic that's really more, more you than me.
[2734.70 → 2739.14] And I need to shut up for a little bit here and just chill out a little bit.
[2739.22 → 2739.38] Yeah.
[2739.42 → 2741.78] I want you to, I want you to, oh, sponsor break.
[2741.88 → 2742.06] Yeah.
[2742.08 → 2743.42] I mean, I guess we could do that.
[2744.88 → 2745.24] Sure.
[2745.38 → 2745.56] Yeah.
[2745.56 → 2745.80] Yeah.
[2745.80 → 2748.34] Let's get, let's get, let's get the sponsors talked about here.

[2824.96 → 2825.80] Okay, I lied.
[2825.88 → 2829.28] I have one more thing to say because Hardware Unboxed just messaged me.
[2829.36 → 2832.22] So I just want to have a quick look at what's going on here.
[2832.36 → 2832.88] Hi, guys.
[2833.64 → 2834.48] Actually, oh, wow.
[2834.60 → 2838.18] Not the only one who's messaging me here.
[2838.32 → 2841.20] So I heard from Hardware Unboxed say, great job on WAN.
[2841.50 → 2842.50] You really did an amazing job.
[2842.56 → 2843.52] You sound like you're surprised.
[2843.64 → 2845.24] You know, I do actually do this for a living.
[2845.88 → 2847.04] He might not watch your content.
[2847.10 → 2847.32] No, no.
[2847.60 → 2848.70] I don't think he does.
[2848.70 → 2853.48] And I actually heard from one of my favourites, one of my longtime favourites.
[2853.68 → 2858.06] Dr. Curtis taught me so much of what I know about computers.
[2859.00 → 2863.66] You know, him, Ryan Smith, Anand Lakshmi, Ryan Shout.
[2864.12 → 2867.58] There's someone really important that I'm forgetting from the old Anand Tech, Gary Key.
[2868.34 → 2871.92] Those guys basically brought me into the fold.
[2872.04 → 2874.68] They brought me into computer technology.
[2874.68 → 2883.34] And I was, wow, I'm honoured to get a message like this from Dr. Curtis.
[2883.44 → 2885.64] Just says, big kudos for the NVIDIA passion.
[2885.82 → 2887.82] Voiced a lot of concerns so very well.
[2888.78 → 2891.46] And then this is sort of editorial plans that he has.
[2891.50 → 2892.62] So I'm not going to talk about that.
[2892.72 → 2894.24] That's his private information.
[2894.36 → 2895.42] But thank you, Dr. Curtis.
[2895.54 → 2896.44] Good to hear from you, Ian.
[2896.90 → 2897.74] Man, I miss you.
[2898.00 → 2900.64] We haven't chilled in forever because of this COVID.
[2900.64 → 2906.00] So next time we get a chance, I'm hopping on the next plane to the next trade show that actually exists.
[2906.24 → 2907.46] And I will see you there.
[2908.28 → 2908.96] All right.
[2909.54 → 2910.76] So, yeah, thanks, guys.
[2911.24 → 2913.48] You know, I'm not doing this for kudos, though.
[2913.56 → 2915.96] I'm doing this because it's legitimately actually important.
[2917.54 → 2923.56] And, oh, man, I didn't even talk about how NVIDIA doing this empowers other manufacturers to take these strong arm approach to things.
[2923.56 → 2932.90] Like, if NVIDIA starts doing this, who's going to say that, you know, Intel isn't going to look over and say, oh, wow, well, this is a perfect idea.
[2932.98 → 2938.58] We don't have to cede products to anyone that doesn't say how amazing our, you know, AVX 512 extension is.
[2939.08 → 2939.28] Wow.
[2939.46 → 2941.30] What a wonderful idea.
[2942.78 → 2943.02] Okay.
[2943.34 → 2943.60] Okay.
[2943.76 → 2944.02] Okay.
[2944.12 → 2944.92] Talk about Cyberpunk.
[2945.16 → 2945.44] Please.
[2945.56 → 2947.02] I need to stop thinking about this now.
[2947.02 → 2947.30] Okay.
[2947.70 → 2954.02] So, Cyberpunk has problems on old consoles, on old hardware, et cetera.
[2954.44 → 2960.44] On PC, if you have the might, it can look really fantastic.
[2961.42 → 2962.98] Night City looks beautiful.
[2963.12 → 2964.72] Some of the models are absolutely fantastic.
[2964.72 → 2972.36] But on mortal hardware, as it's described in the doc, and I like that, more common hardware, it can chug pretty hard.
[2972.48 → 2976.08] For instance, GTX 1080, that's the same thing I ran it on.
[2976.08 → 2978.66] It's the same thing as the person who wrote this ran it on.
[2979.06 → 2983.48] It can chug pretty hard if you try to put it at a very nice setting.
[2983.90 → 2987.20] It sounds like the person in the doc ran with mostly medium settings.
[2987.36 → 2988.64] That's the same thing I did.
[2988.98 → 2991.52] And they noticed it regularly dipping below 60.
[2991.86 → 2992.58] So did I.
[2993.18 → 2994.56] Sounds like we had a very similar experience.
[2995.42 → 2999.08] They say they haven't had very many bad bugs yet, but they're only about four hours in.
[2999.18 → 3002.16] I'm in less time than that and have experienced some bugs.
[3002.16 → 3004.74] But I was also kind of poking for them.
[3004.84 → 3006.44] So I don't know how fair that is.
[3006.64 → 3006.66] Nerd.
[3007.02 → 3007.62] Nerd.
[3008.08 → 3008.74] A little bit.
[3010.10 → 3022.94] On the PS4, however, it runs between 720p and 900p with a frame rate of around 15 to 20 FPS in the city.
[3022.94 → 3027.02] Getting closer to 30 FPS inside or indoors.
[3027.34 → 3028.26] Yeah, that's pretty rough.
[3028.38 → 3030.90] 15 is like not.
[3032.10 → 3033.90] It's not a good experience.
[3034.26 → 3036.10] No, not even freaking remotely.
[3036.10 → 3048.84] There are also lots of examples you guys have probably seen around the internet of things that like if you've seen Cyberpunk on a good setup, just don't even actually look.
[3051.34 → 3052.34] I'll read that later.
[3052.54 → 3055.14] Don't even actually look like Cyberpunk.
[3055.14 → 3058.30] There's also some really, terrible interactions.
[3058.30 → 3071.00] Like I saw one clip where someone walked up to a person in the game and the detail level of their clothing just rapidly changed in front of them without ever actually sticking on one thing.
[3071.12 → 3071.38] Right.
[3071.90 → 3078.10] Probably due to performance issues of other models in the scene and trying to decide what render distance it wanted to do and stuff.
[3078.20 → 3082.94] And if it's a busy street, there could be models popping in and out constantly, and they just wouldn't know what to do.
[3082.94 → 3083.70] Yeah.
[3084.28 → 3086.78] So like graphically, there are lots of issues.
[3086.90 → 3093.28] Digital Foundry has done fantastic analysis on the game as they generally do with these types of things.
[3093.64 → 3102.14] There's a quote from them that says for a particular car chase in the game on PS4, it just cannot run.
[3103.06 → 3108.56] It's not that it's running under 20 FPS, but it stutters as well as streams in the world.
[3108.56 → 3113.48] There's slowdown, there's stuttering, and the visual quality is seriously compromised.
[3114.14 → 3115.80] I mean, the whole thing is just kind of a mess.
[3116.00 → 3119.92] That's not what you want Digital Foundry to be saying about your game.
[3120.54 → 3128.60] So, yeah, it has major performance issues, which I think on PC is a little bit more excusable.
[3128.72 → 3129.48] We're just used to that.
[3129.48 → 3129.88] Yeah.
[3130.04 → 3130.44] Yeah.
[3130.64 → 3137.14] And like sometimes the argument of like, oh, you have to go get new hardware to play new fancy game is kind of embraced.
[3137.48 → 3137.72] Yeah.
[3137.86 → 3138.54] By the PC community.
[3138.70 → 3146.88] But there's a bigger problem for console players because this is a perfect argument for why licenses for games should be platform-agnostic.
[3146.88 → 3159.72] Because if I'm someone who bought this game for PS4 and I don't manage to get it refunded within my refund window, whatever that is in Sony's shop, and I want to play it like properly at some point, I now have to buy another copy of the game.
[3159.80 → 3160.26] Like what?
[3160.26 → 3160.30] Right.
[3160.78 → 3169.72] And whereas on PC, we actually do buy games that we know are pushing the limits of our hardware, knowing that we're going to play it through once for the story.
[3169.92 → 3171.60] We're going to save our pennies.
[3171.72 → 3178.72] We're going to upgrade our graphics card six months down the line, and then we're going to crank the eye candy, and we're going to play it again and have like a whole new experience.
[3178.78 → 3180.42] That's like that's part of PC gaming.
[3181.26 → 3181.38] Yeah.
[3181.68 → 3184.92] And there are arguments there, too, for like replayability of the game and whatnot.
[3184.92 → 3185.52] Yeah, absolutely.
[3185.70 → 3192.84] But like it is kind of, it's aggravating to be able to buy something for something specific.
[3192.84 → 3196.40] Like I can buy this game specifically for a PS4.
[3196.74 → 3203.20] I'm going to buy the hard copy because I'm weird, and it's going to say PS4 on the box because it's made for that console.
[3203.40 → 3205.96] And then it is basically unplayable.
[3206.04 → 3211.92] I would argue that ranging from 720p to 900p and 15 to 20 FPS is unplayable.
[3212.58 → 3212.78] Yep.
[3212.78 → 3218.42] I think some people might disagree with me, but I'm not very concerned about that minority.
[3219.26 → 3221.00] It can cause nausea for people.
[3221.28 → 3229.30] Like very low frame rates, especially if you're playing on a TV, like on a large TV, can actually cause physical problems for people.
[3229.38 → 3233.00] This is about more than just PCMR elitism.
[3233.16 → 3234.22] Ew, 15 FPS.
[3234.54 → 3240.18] Like that affects your ability to play competitively for realties.
[3240.18 → 3247.84] And okay, it's not a multiplayer game, but that doesn't mean that you don't want to compete with, you know, your own knowledge of your own skills.
[3247.84 → 3252.54] Like you don't want to be underperforming compared to how you think you should be able to play a game.
[3252.54 → 3258.98] Like I only played it briefly, and I went through a car chase scene where you're supposed to like, actually it might be the same one Digital Foundry was talking about.
[3259.02 → 3259.66] I didn't watch the video.
[3259.86 → 3265.06] But you're supposed to shoot opponents that are in like another car that's in front of you and like moving around and stuff.
[3265.42 → 3268.04] There is no way that I could have done it at 15 FPS.
[3268.04 → 3275.26] It was hard enough with it chugging on the settings I was playing on with the 1080.
[3275.56 → 3282.16] There have been some comments in the chat and I think we might have said some confusing things, very much myself included.
[3283.14 → 3285.20] This has an upgrade to PS5.
[3285.56 → 3290.74] What Linus was talking about was a general thing where all games should be platform-agnostic.
[3290.98 → 3291.24] Yes.
[3291.24 → 3295.22] Wasn't necessarily talking about only this one in this one case.
[3295.36 → 3295.66] That's right.
[3295.66 → 3298.10] He's talking like everything should be platform-agnostic.
[3298.16 → 3298.44] Correct.
[3299.28 → 3302.86] So yeah, I just wanted to make sure we had that clarification fully out there.
[3303.08 → 3303.48] Sorry.
[3303.66 → 3305.98] Sorry for the confusion.
[3307.20 → 3308.34] Every game should.
[3308.74 → 3309.26] There you go.
[3309.64 → 3321.16] There should be no reason why you are ever, ever stuck with a copy of a game for a console that doesn't run it properly and then not be able to experience it properly with the same license of the game that you've already
[3321.16 → 3321.56] purchased.
[3322.74 → 3324.02] Thanks for jumping in with that, guys.
[3324.14 → 3324.26] Yep.
[3324.34 → 3324.88] Go ahead, Luke.
[3325.56 → 3325.80] Yep.
[3326.84 → 3327.28] Moving.
[3327.42 → 3329.12] Basically, performance bad.
[3329.44 → 3330.60] Performance real, real bad.
[3331.08 → 3331.80] Moving on.
[3331.92 → 3333.56] Cyberpunk is causing seizures.
[3333.70 → 3343.34] A sequence in the game features blinking red and white LEDs similar to the ones used by doctors to induce seizures for diagnosis purposes.
[3343.78 → 3348.12] Initially, the game only included a seizure warning in the game's EULA, which no one reads.
[3348.92 → 3351.24] Now we're working on adding a separate warning in the game.
[3351.38 → 3353.82] I did notice when I launched my game.
[3353.90 → 3354.62] There's a warning now.
[3355.26 → 3356.62] That says the seizure warning.
[3357.60 → 3359.62] But still, like, ugh.
[3359.92 → 3360.94] It's not the best look.
[3360.94 → 3371.42] And also, like, there's even aside from the white and red flashing, like, the way that even the website for the game, like, kind of glitches.
[3371.60 → 3376.76] Like, I thought my display was actually broken or, like, I had a bad HDMI connection or something like that.
[3376.80 → 3379.08] I understand that's an aesthetic you guys are going after.
[3379.08 → 3393.36] I, if there's anything we've learned from having things like a dead pixel on one of our cameras, it's that it's not really conducive to the user's enjoyment to have them think that their equipment is defective.
[3393.72 → 3393.86] Okay?
[3393.92 → 3401.10] When people are watching an LTT video, and it makes them think they have a dead pixel on their monitor, they're not really, they're not focused on enjoying the video.
[3401.10 → 3407.08] In much the same way that, like, if you're half the time you think that your, you know, TV's broken, you're not going to.
[3407.14 → 3408.88] And I'm not saying half that anyone's that stupid.
[3408.96 → 3415.14] I'm just saying as an aesthetic or artistic choice, I don't know, maybe reconsider next time.
[3415.18 → 3415.52] That's all.
[3415.80 → 3416.14] That's all.
[3416.16 → 3417.24] I'm not saying it's the end of the world.
[3419.66 → 3424.34] And last but not least, and this isn't to note in the doc, but it's the user score.
[3424.84 → 3425.24] All right.
[3425.38 → 3425.66] All right.
[3425.66 → 3428.26] Luke, talk about how you really feel.
[3428.42 → 3429.76] Talk about how you really feel, Luke.
[3429.76 → 3436.18] There was already articles going out about, like, why a 90 was a failure.
[3437.26 → 3444.54] Cyberpunk got a 90 on Metacritic, and it was interpreted as very bad.
[3444.62 → 3448.24] And some people were like, how is it, like, if I got 90 on a test, I'd be super stoked.
[3448.32 → 3449.24] So how is this bad?
[3449.30 → 3450.92] Well, there's a lot to do with that.
[3450.96 → 3452.14] I'm not even going to go into that now.
[3452.40 → 3458.42] What is more in the realm of failure, and to be honest, as I've looked at this throughout the day,
[3458.42 → 3460.22] it has constantly increased.
[3460.22 → 3463.98] So maybe it's not really going to be as much of a thing.
[3464.22 → 3467.72] But the user score this morning was below six.
[3467.88 → 3469.88] It is now currently 6.1.
[3470.08 → 3476.68] There are some things in the game that may have led to certain people just review bombing it.
[3476.92 → 3477.04] Yes.
[3477.04 → 3483.48] I don't think that's entirely the reason why it has this score.
[3483.48 → 3492.18] I've read through a decent amount of the reviews, and a lot of them felt kind of the same way about it that I did.
[3493.44 → 3495.24] It's very railed at the beginning.
[3496.24 → 3501.58] Night City is very pretty, but feels very dead.
[3501.58 → 3504.90] There's a lot of lacking of AI.
[3506.66 → 3511.34] Someone was talking in one of the reviews that if you need to get away from the police,
[3511.68 → 3515.22] the way you do it is by driving in a straight line because they pop out.
[3516.08 → 3516.32] Yeah.
[3516.74 → 3520.82] I was able to get away from the police in my just visual impressions video.
[3520.82 → 3525.94] I was able to get away from the police by starting a story dialogue.
[3525.94 → 3533.22] So I just ran over to someone that I was supposed to talk to continue the story,
[3533.38 → 3536.50] and the police behind me just stopped being interested in me immediately.
[3536.64 → 3538.26] I was no longer a wanted criminal.
[3538.70 → 3541.48] I mean, that's like GTA 1 stuff.
[3541.94 → 3544.48] Yeah, you can't continue until you drop your wanted level.
[3544.66 → 3546.32] That's some super basic stuff.
[3546.32 → 3552.98] It feels, despite how much time, despite how many articles came out about the crunch that went on it,
[3553.24 → 3555.02] despite all this stuff.
[3555.02 → 3556.64] Despite the fact they worked on it for eight years.
[3557.12 → 3558.74] It feels kind of unfinished.
[3559.48 → 3561.56] Also, I'm like, I don't know.
[3561.72 → 3564.48] I played for a while, not like a super long time,
[3564.60 → 3569.08] but I have only seen things so far that were either in trailers
[3569.08 → 3574.80] or like in short gameplay snippets that they have uploaded.
[3575.38 → 3581.20] I'm sure there's a lot more to the game, but it lacks a sense of impact.
[3581.20 → 3584.88] I have a hard time so far really caring about a lot of the characters.
[3585.02 → 3586.52] Including my own character.
[3586.52 → 3591.26] It lacks a sense of impact when you do things in the game.
[3591.26 → 3592.40] Things feel very hollow.
[3592.40 → 3600.54] An example that I would give for that is in God of War, the feverish God of War,
[3600.54 → 3602.48] when you throw the axe and catch it again.
[3602.48 → 3607.16] There was like articles about how amazing that feeling was because it had fantastic feedback.
[3607.16 → 3609.66] It had a fantastic impact.
[3610.58 → 3615.62] And like almost nothing in Cyberpunk feels like it properly has that amount of impact,
[3615.62 → 3617.58] which breaks immersion.
[3617.98 → 3624.54] It's this beautiful game, but it feels like a picture instead of a game.
[3625.04 → 3628.02] I'm not far enough in to make an actual review at all.
[3628.02 → 3631.52] To disclaim it, this is not a review and Luke still...
[3631.52 → 3632.90] Are you planning to play it more?
[3632.90 → 3635.26] Or are you just like kind of not that into it?
[3635.26 → 3637.78] I feel super motivated to play it right away,
[3637.78 → 3641.86] but I feel like it's too monumental of a thing for me to not go back too eventually.
[3641.86 → 3643.28] I just don't know exactly what I will.
[3643.28 → 3643.78] Right.
[3643.96 → 3644.34] All right.
[3644.38 → 3644.86] That's fair.
[3645.02 → 3645.56] That's fair.
[3646.24 → 3647.32] We've got a leak.
[3648.14 → 3649.28] I hope people like it.
[3649.34 → 3650.14] I hope it improves.
[3650.26 → 3651.66] I would like to like the game.
[3651.66 → 3653.66] It just...
[3653.66 → 3656.54] In its current state, I'm not there, but I really...
[3656.54 → 3657.14] I would like to.
[3657.36 → 3658.92] So hopefully something happens.
[3660.22 → 3660.98] All right.
[3661.14 → 3666.02] Let's do the 32 core Apple Silicon Mac Pro leak.
[3666.22 → 3669.18] So this is according to Mark German via Bloomberg.
[3669.40 → 3670.58] This is a rumour.
[3671.08 → 3673.44] Apple is expecting to produce Apple Silicon processors
[3673.44 → 3677.28] that are faster than even the current best performing Intel PCs,
[3677.62 → 3678.28] like period.
[3678.78 → 3680.64] Like not just within a given power envelope.
[3680.64 → 3683.64] The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel
[3683.64 → 3685.70] into its own Silicon in 2022.
[3686.24 → 3688.64] The unnamed sources say at present,
[3688.76 → 3690.96] the plan for 2021 is a new MacBook Pro
[3690.96 → 3694.18] and both an entry-level and high-end iMac.
[3694.30 → 3696.62] So I'd be expecting something competitive with like,
[3696.72 → 3700.04] you know, a Core i9 10900K,
[3700.16 → 3701.90] like that kind of class of product.
[3702.14 → 3706.08] For graphics, Apple is testing 16 and 32 core parts.
[3706.20 → 3709.30] And given how well their onboard graphics have performed so far
[3709.30 → 3711.14] in only seven and eight core configurations,
[3711.36 → 3713.82] I am very interested to see how these do.
[3714.26 → 3717.94] And the highest-end Mac Pro would be expected to come sometime in 2022
[3717.94 → 3723.08] and could gain 64 or 128 core graphics processing
[3723.08 → 3728.24] to go along with the 32 core from the 32 high-performance
[3728.24 → 3730.94] Apple Silicon CPUs built into the SoC.
[3730.94 → 3735.52] The first M1 machine in 2021 could be a 24-inch iMac,
[3735.70 → 3736.84] possibly in March.
[3737.00 → 3739.46] So this is all leaks and rumours,
[3739.66 → 3740.92] but is interesting nonetheless.
[3741.40 → 3743.92] Apple is clearly aware
[3743.92 → 3746.46] that in order to compete at the very high end,
[3746.52 → 3747.60] they needed a lot more cores.
[3747.72 → 3750.98] And it looks like they're planning to like to go there.
[3751.46 → 3752.22] Very much deliver.
[3752.46 → 3752.62] Yeah.
[3752.72 → 3752.94] Yeah.
[3753.00 → 3753.78] Very exciting.
[3754.68 → 3755.16] All right.
[3755.20 → 3757.40] I don't really want to talk about the 6900 XT launch.
[3757.50 → 3757.96] It's like,
[3758.10 → 3758.26] yep,
[3758.30 → 3759.10] if you want to know about that,
[3759.14 → 3759.94] you can go watch our review.
[3760.06 → 3760.82] Clearly nobody cared
[3760.82 → 3762.66] because it didn't perform very well.
[3763.18 → 3763.46] I mean,
[3763.52 → 3764.10] our video,
[3764.22 → 3764.68] our video,
[3764.84 → 3766.30] the graphics card's very fast.
[3767.54 → 3768.12] It's just,
[3768.20 → 3768.96] it's just not,
[3769.32 → 3771.06] it's just like not that interesting.
[3771.22 → 3771.36] It's,
[3771.42 → 3773.00] it's a faster 6800 XT,
[3773.10 → 3773.90] just like the
[3774.54 → 3775.26] well,
[3775.34 → 3775.52] no,
[3775.52 → 3778.18] not just like the 3090 was a faster 3080
[3778.18 → 3780.46] because the 3090 added a bunch more memory and stuff,
[3780.54 → 3781.80] which actually does make a difference
[3781.80 → 3782.82] at very high resolutions.
[3782.82 → 3783.74] Uh,
[3783.80 → 3786.70] but the 6800 XT already had 16 gigs of RAM.
[3786.80 → 3787.18] So it's like,
[3787.26 → 3787.44] oh,
[3787.44 → 3787.84] okay.
[3788.20 → 3788.66] So it's,
[3788.66 → 3788.84] it's,
[3788.84 → 3789.44] it's faster.
[3789.66 → 3790.06] Uh,
[3790.06 → 3790.58] it's faster.
[3790.64 → 3791.14] It's better.
[3791.56 → 3792.92] So HDMI 2.1.
[3793.20 → 3793.64] Um,
[3794.42 → 3795.66] one random note from Nick.
[3795.78 → 3796.34] Um,
[3796.98 → 3798.32] he thinks that,
[3798.32 → 3799.06] uh,
[3799.06 → 3803.40] you guys may have underestimated the number of people that would buy the biggest boy.
[3803.40 → 3804.00] Um,
[3804.54 → 3804.70] Oh,
[3804.70 → 3806.56] for the desk pad by 700.
[3806.56 → 3810.28] It is currently the top seller and one third of them are gone.
[3810.56 → 3811.00] Okay.
[3811.52 → 3812.12] Uh,
[3812.12 → 3813.46] so a couple of things here,
[3813.48 → 3813.80] guys,
[3814.02 → 3815.98] please buy the smaller ones.
[3816.06 → 3817.10] And number two,
[3817.10 → 3818.62] if you want one of the bigger ones,
[3818.72 → 3820.44] make sure you move the fast.
[3821.18 → 3821.62] Um,
[3821.80 → 3823.24] because they are,
[3823.36 → 3824.10] they're going,
[3824.84 → 3825.60] they're going.
[3825.72 → 3826.26] All right.
[3826.26 → 3827.80] All right.
[3828.52 → 3830.60] Still got a few more things I want to talk about here.
[3830.70 → 3831.10] All right.
[3831.20 → 3831.94] AirPods Max.
[3832.72 → 3833.88] Apple shared,
[3833.96 → 3834.60] uh,
[3834.72 → 3838.34] details about their professional set of over ear headphones.
[3838.66 → 3840.16] They feature audio sharing.
[3840.16 → 3843.14] So you can easily share an audio stream between two sets of AirPods.
[3843.14 → 3843.80] Although that,
[3844.22 → 3844.92] if I recall correctly,
[3844.92 → 3848.74] was already a thing equipped with the H one chip in each ear cup.
[3848.86 → 3852.26] So they use computational audio to deliver the highest quality listening experience possible.
[3852.34 → 3852.62] Okay.
[3852.62 → 3852.98] I guess,
[3853.06 → 3853.18] well,
[3853.22 → 3854.14] that remains to be seen.
[3854.14 → 3854.84] I mean,
[3854.84 → 3857.50] the highest quality listening experience possible.
[3857.62 → 3859.12] This is where Apple runs into trouble.
[3859.64 → 3861.24] Why don't you just say it's perfect?
[3862.26 → 3862.46] Like,
[3862.56 → 3863.16] this is where,
[3863.30 → 3864.82] this is where I end up,
[3865.14 → 3865.46] you know,
[3866.02 → 3866.14] you,
[3866.22 → 3866.32] you,
[3866.46 → 3866.66] you,
[3866.66 → 3868.26] you forced my hand in this Apple.
[3868.48 → 3868.84] Okay.
[3868.84 → 3874.40] Because this is where I end up making a video saying Apple's up to their nonsense again,
[3874.60 → 3877.72] making marketing claims that can't possibly be true.
[3878.24 → 3878.56] Oh,
[3878.74 → 3881.08] and then Apple fanboys come after me and they say,
[3881.14 → 3882.98] Linus is always just down on Apple.
[3883.20 → 3884.08] And it's like,
[3884.16 → 3884.54] no,
[3884.68 → 3884.98] no.
[3885.08 → 3886.84] What I said was the marketing is bad.
[3886.92 → 3888.18] I'm not saying the product is bad.
[3888.20 → 3888.70] I'm just saying,
[3889.02 → 3896.16] I sincerely doubt that it is the highest quality listening experience possible.
[3896.16 → 3902.40] That's all I'm saying is that it probably isn't that.
[3903.38 → 3903.74] Okay.
[3905.74 → 3906.22] Yeah.
[3906.68 → 3907.28] Highest quality.
[3907.34 → 3910.50] That is a direct quote from their website.
[3911.02 → 3913.52] I sincerely doubt it.
[3915.80 → 3916.20] Okay.
[3917.14 → 3918.24] High fidelity audio,
[3918.34 → 3919.06] DAC to be Q,
[3919.18 → 3920.04] active noise cancellation,
[3920.20 → 3920.64] spatial audio,
[3920.76 → 3921.42] transparency mode.
[3921.46 → 3922.06] All that sounds good.
[3922.12 → 3922.54] Like to be clear,
[3922.64 → 3925.90] I love my AirPods pros and the AirPods are good too.
[3925.90 → 3926.78] I think they're good products.
[3926.84 → 3927.92] I think it's a good product line.
[3928.10 → 3929.20] I have high hopes for this.
[3929.96 → 3931.82] Just don't say stuff.
[3931.90 → 3933.62] That's just obviously not true.
[3934.26 → 3938.76] Like the highest quality listening experience possible.
[3939.46 → 3942.02] Just say it's a pair of over the ear headphones.
[3942.16 → 3942.86] It's pretty good.
[3943.82 → 3944.44] Maybe even,
[3944.56 → 3946.00] maybe even good.
[3946.96 → 3947.86] Just say that.
[3948.54 → 3948.78] Like,
[3948.90 → 3949.40] ah,
[3950.02 → 3950.74] five colours,
[3950.92 → 3952.40] including space gray,
[3952.56 → 3952.86] silver.
[3953.48 → 3953.78] Sorry.
[3953.78 → 3955.52] You went robot there for a sec.
[3955.54 → 3955.94] Hit me again.
[3956.62 → 3958.24] You should try to get your hands on some Orpheus
[3958.24 → 3959.22] and then compare the two.
[3959.56 → 3959.92] Exactly.
[3960.06 → 3960.18] Right.
[3960.22 → 3960.32] But,
[3960.36 → 3960.82] but then I,
[3960.94 → 3963.08] then I get accused of being like an Apple hater.
[3963.16 → 3963.32] Like,
[3963.38 → 3963.50] yeah,
[3963.50 → 3965.68] you had to spend $20,000 in order to beat it.
[3965.82 → 3966.18] Right.
[3966.40 → 3968.78] But Apple positioned themselves against it.
[3968.98 → 3973.56] They said theirs was the highest quality listening experience possible,
[3973.56 → 3975.06] which is just like,
[3975.14 → 3977.22] obviously not true.
[3977.22 → 3980.62] So then I'm made out to be the bad guy.
[3981.62 → 3981.98] Uh,
[3982.02 → 3982.30] okay.
[3982.72 → 3983.22] Space gray,
[3983.32 → 3983.52] silver,
[3983.62 → 3983.80] sky,
[3983.86 → 3983.98] blue,
[3983.98 → 3984.22] green,
[3984.26 → 3984.70] and pink.
[3984.82 → 3985.80] They're $549,
[3986.18 → 3987.08] which honestly,
[3987.22 → 3989.38] I thought a lot of people were like outraged about the price.
[3989.46 → 3990.30] And I'm looking at it going like,
[3990.78 → 3992.08] have you ever shopped for headphones?
[3993.68 → 3997.50] Especially if these are the highest quality listening experience possible.
[3998.06 → 3998.62] Like if these go.
[3999.50 → 4000.12] Experience possible.
[4000.28 → 4001.96] That is an amazing.
[4002.36 → 4004.00] That's a smoking deal.
[4004.00 → 4005.50] Oh my goodness.
[4005.90 → 4006.54] Ladies and gentlemen,
[4006.54 → 4007.82] do I have something to sell you?
[4008.92 → 4009.24] Uh,
[4009.26 → 4010.38] according to Mark German,
[4010.48 → 4010.68] again,
[4010.76 → 4014.24] Apple reportedly ditched some features in order to release them in 2020 touch
[4014.24 → 4014.62] controls.
[4014.76 → 4014.94] Nope.
[4015.10 → 4015.70] Digital crown,
[4015.82 → 4016.70] like the Apple Watch,
[4016.80 → 4017.26] um,
[4017.26 → 4018.42] provides volume control.
[4018.56 → 4018.68] Wait,
[4018.74 → 4019.76] are these missing features?
[4019.84 → 4020.40] I don't even know.
[4020.46 → 4021.18] I'll look at this later.
[4021.60 → 4022.00] Uh,
[4022.00 → 4023.24] no customizable headbands.
[4023.38 → 4023.72] All right.
[4024.86 → 4025.34] Um,
[4025.50 → 4026.48] missing the U one chip.
[4026.56 → 4027.58] So no wireless handoffs.
[4027.62 → 4027.98] Okay.
[4028.10 → 4028.42] Sure.
[4028.82 → 4029.24] And,
[4029.24 → 4030.02] uh,
[4030.02 → 4030.32] all right.
[4030.38 → 4030.88] Last thing.
[4030.96 → 4032.32] This is from consumer reports.
[4032.72 → 4033.98] HP's free ink for life.
[4034.00 → 4036.96] Life plan is over because some scams are legal.
[4037.72 → 4038.24] Um,
[4038.36 → 4039.38] just three years ago,
[4039.48 → 4040.86] HP launched its instant ink.
[4041.72 → 4042.16] HP.
[4043.48 → 4044.04] Get it.
[4044.14 → 4044.30] Oh,
[4044.36 → 4044.72] I get it.
[4044.76 → 4045.18] Very funny.
[4045.44 → 4045.64] Uh,
[4045.64 → 4049.94] HP launched its instant ink print subscription program where HP would send more ink when
[4049.94 → 4050.68] levels run low.
[4050.82 → 4054.14] The free tier allowed users to print up to 15 pages per month without having to worry
[4054.14 → 4057.08] about paying to refill their ink or even going to the store to get it.
[4057.72 → 4057.90] Wait,
[4057.96 → 4058.16] what?
[4058.24 → 4059.92] Where HP would send more ink when levels run low?
[4060.14 → 4063.50] This has been extremely popular over the last year with the global pandemic and HP
[4063.50 → 4064.98] considers the program,
[4065.16 → 4067.00] a global success,
[4067.14 → 4068.26] how the free tier works.
[4068.46 → 4069.10] HP monitors,
[4069.22 → 4072.14] the number of pages printed a dollar gets you 10 more pages.
[4072.40 → 4073.80] After every five pages,
[4074.04 → 4075.36] HP prints out an ad,
[4075.52 → 4077.90] which supposedly doesn't count towards ink and print usage.
[4078.00 → 4078.96] What even is this?
[4079.32 → 4080.28] The paid tiers,
[4080.46 → 4081.30] unsurprisingly allow,
[4081.38 → 4082.98] why would they like wasting paper like that?
[4083.06 → 4083.32] Really?
[4083.78 → 4088.02] Allow you to print more per month, and you don't have to put up with a printer that prints
[4088.02 → 4088.44] ads.
[4088.44 → 4090.68] Okay.
[4091.26 → 4093.78] And the late stage capitalism here is about to get worse.
[4094.28 → 4099.12] That free plan now costs a dollar a month to run a printer that you already own and
[4099.12 → 4102.14] potentially bought on the premise of using the free ink program.
[4102.32 → 4102.68] Got it.
[4103.00 → 4104.02] There's some good news though.
[4104.32 → 4106.30] Laser printers are now getting toner subscriptions.
[4107.04 → 4111.10] Subscriptions purchased with new printers get six months free and unused pages roll over
[4111.10 → 4113.22] for up to three months instead of two.
[4113.22 → 4114.72] If you cancel your subscription,
[4114.90 → 4116.32] which many are threatening to do with the new price,
[4116.70 → 4120.56] the instant ink cartridge in the printer will cease to function altogether because of
[4120.56 → 4121.14] course it will.
[4121.76 → 4122.16] HP,
[4122.46 → 4123.00] go f*** yourself.
[4123.62 → 4124.02] Thank you.
[4124.16 → 4124.64] That is all.
[4125.48 → 4125.94] Nice.
[4126.58 → 4127.48] In other news,
[4127.60 → 4129.66] the LTT store desk pad.
[4129.82 → 4130.14] Okay.
[4130.24 → 4131.88] You're going to buy it for $29.99.
[4132.20 → 4134.68] And then if you expect to keep moving your mouse across it,
[4134.92 → 4140.50] suddenly I am going to spring on you a program where every kilometre that you move your mouse
[4140.50 → 4143.94] along the mouse pad is going to cost you $10.69.
[4144.42 → 4145.24] Thank you very much.
[4145.58 → 4148.38] You can go buy your LTT store desk pads now.
[4148.50 → 4152.56] Your first two kilometres are free as long as you use all of them within the first three months.
[4152.70 → 4154.58] Like what even is going on right now,
[4154.64 → 4154.94] Luke?
[4156.16 → 4157.02] What is happening?
[4157.72 → 4160.70] You could legitimately put a thing in like,
[4160.86 → 4162.48] you could say that you get free,
[4162.62 → 4164.96] you get free,
[4165.30 → 4168.08] free wireless charging built into your desk pad.
[4168.08 → 4172.24] All you got to do is buy the wireless charging accessory and buy a subscription for wireless charging.
[4172.62 → 4174.58] Like what is going on?
[4175.22 → 4180.92] More than 22 hours a day without turning off your mouse manually.
[4181.14 → 4183.98] Then there's a $1 charge per day.
[4184.40 → 4186.86] But it's free if you,
[4187.18 → 4187.44] when you,
[4187.50 → 4188.96] for two years when you buy the device.
[4189.38 → 4190.28] Freaking hell.
[4191.40 → 4194.12] And then you just pull that back and make it so that,
[4194.20 → 4194.46] ah,
[4194.46 → 4195.92] if you charge your device at all,
[4196.02 → 4196.84] it's a dollar a day.
[4196.84 → 4197.16] Man,
[4197.22 → 4199.04] that Fukuyama quote feels super,
[4199.32 → 4200.64] super appropriate right now.
[4201.10 → 4201.30] Well,
[4201.36 → 4202.12] two of them, actually.
[4202.30 → 4203.28] Shut up and take my money,
[4203.42 → 4203.96] number one.
[4204.10 → 4204.86] And number two,
[4204.94 → 4206.50] I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
[4207.10 → 4207.62] It's just,
[4207.74 → 4209.00] I just can't.
[4209.56 → 4210.16] All right.
[4210.66 → 4212.84] Why don't we get into our super chats here?
[4212.90 → 4215.72] Because I'm sure you guys have sent me some interesting stuff.
[4216.90 → 4217.22] Ilya,
[4217.64 → 4218.00] Linus,
[4218.00 → 4220.32] is your watch still working after today's shocking experiments?
[4220.48 → 4220.74] Yes,
[4220.90 → 4221.26] my watch,
[4221.34 → 4222.16] I guess so.
[4222.22 → 4222.36] I mean,
[4222.36 → 4223.80] I don't actually use it,
[4223.98 → 4224.26] but yes,
[4224.28 → 4224.98] it seems to be working.
[4225.94 → 4226.50] What else we got?
[4227.16 → 4228.44] You should have like a
[4228.44 → 4229.64] a new segment.
[4229.64 → 4231.02] That's like scam watch.
[4232.16 → 4233.06] Scam watch.
[4233.64 → 4234.00] Oh,
[4234.18 → 4234.94] scam watch.
[4235.10 → 4235.18] Like,
[4235.30 → 4235.54] okay.
[4235.60 → 4236.14] I get it.
[4236.62 → 4236.96] I mean,
[4236.96 → 4240.18] I'd like to think it doesn't happen often enough that I need a segment for it.
[4240.24 → 4240.44] But,
[4240.44 → 4240.94] um,
[4241.08 → 4242.14] Tis corp asks,
[4242.14 → 4244.78] will the new LTT underwear skews use the same Ziploc bags?
[4244.86 → 4247.80] I believe we are planning to use the very similar bags,
[4247.96 → 4254.08] but I don't know that they will be identical ones because we moved away from our previous supplier over concerns about their treatment of workers.
[4254.96 → 4255.12] Uh,
[4255.12 → 4255.60] Tommy Gunn,
[4255.64 → 4256.24] 1928.
[4256.40 → 4256.68] Guys,
[4256.88 → 4257.20] did you,
[4257.32 → 4259.24] do you cover that BS from Apple only for the algorithm?
[4259.32 → 4261.06] Are you actually interested in this garbage?
[4261.26 → 4262.70] You are not Apple sales personnel,
[4262.70 → 4263.02] like,
[4263.12 → 4265.98] and then they named a person that I'm not going to name because that's not true.
[4265.98 → 4266.48] Uh,
[4266.84 → 4273.02] we cover Apple products because we are a tech channel and whether you want or buy Apple products at all,
[4273.12 → 4276.00] what Apple does has huge implications for the rest of the industry.
[4276.46 → 4276.72] I mean,
[4276.74 → 4280.52] Apple has a long history of dealing only with favourable media.
[4281.02 → 4281.36] Um,
[4281.42 → 4285.42] so you think it's like some kind of innovation that NVIDIA has come up with here?
[4285.62 → 4285.90] Like,
[4286.58 → 4286.88] no,
[4287.28 → 4290.78] that's why it upsets me when Apple does things.
[4291.30 → 4291.74] Um,
[4291.74 → 4295.94] and that's why I'm happy when Apple does good things because it,
[4295.98 → 4299.86] tends to put pressure on other manufacturers to do good things.
[4299.86 → 4303.30] And it tends to take the pressure off of them to not do bad things.
[4303.58 → 4306.10] So Apple is extremely important.
[4306.72 → 4310.00] Whether you think they're overpriced or good or bad,
[4310.10 → 4311.32] they're important.
[4312.60 → 4313.30] Door bean says,
[4313.36 → 4314.42] what the hell is a toque?
[4315.50 → 4316.42] It's a toque.
[4316.64 → 4317.18] It's this.
[4318.12 → 4319.44] You might call it a beanie.
[4320.40 → 4320.84] Um,
[4320.84 → 4321.32] all right.
[4321.86 → 4322.66] Um,
[4323.84 → 4324.26] oof.
[4324.58 → 4324.94] Uh,
[4324.94 → 4326.88] Ritz Blitz says a lot going on in the world.
[4326.98 → 4327.98] Go hug your loved ones.
[4328.04 → 4333.04] Just had to say goodbye to my dad and hospice over video with someone holding the phone because we can't go see him.
[4333.54 → 4334.74] Lots of memories playing missed.
[4334.80 → 4335.72] I'm sorry to hear that.
[4336.00 → 4336.40] That's,
[4336.50 → 4337.46] that's rough.
[4337.50 → 4338.24] And that's good advice.
[4338.32 → 4340.86] I think I'll do just that as soon as I'm done with the show today.
[4341.66 → 4342.44] A Miller says,
[4342.44 → 4346.00] thank you very much for making the ABCs for gamers book.
[4346.30 → 4347.44] I'm very much single,
[4347.56 → 4349.34] but the friends I gifted them to loved it.
[4350.24 → 4350.78] All right.
[4351.04 → 4351.40] Cool.
[4352.82 → 4355.92] Is this where we get the forever alone memes coming up here?
[4356.30 → 4356.48] Oh,
[4356.62 → 4356.98] sorry.
[4357.98 → 4358.18] Hey,
[4358.28 → 4358.76] someday,
[4359.24 → 4359.64] someday,
[4359.70 → 4360.38] I believe in you.
[4361.14 → 4361.62] Um,
[4361.62 → 4362.62] uh,
[4362.62 → 4363.52] uh,
[4363.58 → 4364.14] all right.
[4364.56 → 4365.12] Uh,
[4366.52 → 4366.82] uh,
[4366.94 → 4369.10] pro minion said Nvidia just confirmed.
[4369.22 → 4373.20] They expect editorial control over reviews in exchange for access to cards.
[4373.48 → 4374.38] You know what?
[4374.50 → 4376.26] This is the first time hearing of it though,
[4376.48 → 4376.82] which,
[4376.82 → 4377.16] uh,
[4377.22 → 4378.50] either Nvidia backtrack,
[4378.66 → 4379.08] Nvidia,
[4379.56 → 4381.58] either Nvidia backtracks on this,
[4381.58 → 4384.48] or it does appear that that's their expectation.
[4384.84 → 4385.28] Honestly,
[4385.28 → 4386.02] I don't buy it.
[4386.02 → 4393.70] I think this is personal, and I think that it's just a phenomenally boneheaded way to go about cutting off someone that there's a personal vendetta against.
[4394.00 → 4394.78] That's what I think.
[4395.68 → 4396.12] Um,
[4396.22 → 4397.64] I thought that's what I would like to think.
[4397.76 → 4397.98] I,
[4398.14 → 4399.10] I don't know anymore.
[4399.24 → 4400.46] I don't know anything anymore.
[4401.82 → 4402.26] Um,
[4402.38 → 4403.44] all right.
[4403.56 → 4404.88] What else we got here?
[4406.26 → 4406.50] Oh,
[4406.62 → 4406.92] haha.
[4407.18 → 4411.08] Sir myself says waiting for Linus Sebastian to follow Linus Torvald's example.
[4411.72 → 4412.16] Uh,
[4412.26 → 4412.74] I think,
[4412.74 → 4415.46] I think you mean that thing that he said to Nvidia.
[4415.46 → 4416.74] And I think I already did it.
[4416.98 → 4418.60] So you won't be waiting anymore.
[4419.22 → 4419.54] Uh,
[4419.54 → 4424.44] Andrew says the BS clickbait titles on LTT videos negate all ability to take Linus seriously anymore.
[4424.58 → 4424.76] Well,
[4424.76 → 4425.30] it's up to you.
[4425.82 → 4426.18] Um,
[4426.24 → 4426.60] to me,
[4426.60 → 4427.78] the title is the packaging.
[4427.86 → 4428.58] If the
[4428.74 → 4430.20] if the food inside is nutritious,
[4430.20 → 4431.56] then I don't really care,
[4431.70 → 4432.18] um,
[4432.18 → 4433.72] what colour the packaging is.
[4433.78 → 4434.00] Uh,
[4434.00 → 4434.82] I'll eat it anyway.
[4435.28 → 4436.92] And you can disagree all you want.
[4436.96 → 4437.84] And if you don't like it,
[4437.84 → 4438.84] you can take your business elsewhere.
[4438.92 → 4439.66] That's the way it is,
[4439.66 → 4440.74] but I don't make the rules.
[4440.94 → 4445.44] I don't make it so that people are more likely to click on this face or whatever.
[4445.46 → 4446.40] I don't like it either,
[4446.54 → 4446.76] but,
[4446.98 → 4447.22] um,
[4447.24 → 4447.90] it is what it is.
[4447.96 → 4451.78] I've got a business to run, and my business is bringing in viewers and giving them the tech,
[4451.92 → 4453.70] the tech information that we do.
[4453.84 → 4454.12] All right.
[4454.16 → 4454.98] And that's all there is to it.
[4455.08 → 4455.48] Guys,
[4455.54 → 4457.32] don't bother sending more super chats right now.
[4457.38 → 4459.44] There's already far more than I can go through.
[4459.82 → 4460.18] Uh,
[4460.18 → 4462.24] I already feel bad for not going through all of them.
[4462.24 → 4462.64] Like,
[4463.10 → 4463.70] okay.
[4464.98 → 4465.46] Um,
[4465.46 → 4467.88] all right.
[4468.32 → 4468.72] Uh,
[4468.84 → 4468.98] uh,
[4468.98 → 4469.32] uh,
[4469.32 → 4470.38] Sean says,
[4470.44 → 4472.68] I would love to buy a mouse mat and some other things,
[4472.68 → 4474.42] but shipping to the UK is insane.
[4474.80 → 4476.58] $20 or around 17 pounds.
[4476.64 → 4477.88] Is there any plan to lower the shipping?
[4478.08 → 4478.36] Um,
[4478.40 → 4480.16] last time I checked jet fuel,
[4480.60 → 4481.64] very expensive.
[4482.26 → 4482.70] Um,
[4482.76 → 4485.30] you guys enjoy Royal Mail over there,
[4485.30 → 4487.06] which as my understanding is,
[4487.08 → 4489.58] it's heavily subsidized in terms of international shipping.
[4489.58 → 4490.92] So it's crazy.
[4491.04 → 4493.50] I can order things from the UK and get them shipped for like $3.
[4494.12 → 4499.46] And you guys can't do the same because incoming shipments are not subsidized by whoever you're ordering from.
[4499.62 → 4503.18] The Canadian government does not subsidize shipping in any meaningful way.
[4503.34 → 4507.30] So we just like actually do have to pay for like what shipping costs.
[4507.42 → 4508.54] And that's just how it is.
[4508.90 → 4509.26] Um,
[4509.28 → 4514.68] we make about 10% on shipping, and we use that margin to run shipping promos from time to time.
[4514.80 → 4519.42] So all you can really do is bundle a bunch of things together in a cart or wait for a shipping promo.
[4519.42 → 4523.02] But I can tell you now with all the launches that we've had and all the launches that are coming up,
[4523.12 → 4526.72] we don't have anything on the roadmap for shipping promos right now,
[4526.78 → 4527.98] which isn't to say it won't happen.
[4528.06 → 4530.04] I'm just saying we don't have anything planned right now.
[4530.24 → 4532.36] So that's kind of the inside baseball.
[4532.98 → 4533.20] Hit me.
[4533.24 → 4538.10] Float play is asking me to ask you if there's an update on the Dell email.
[4538.76 → 4539.60] Dell email?
[4539.82 → 4540.08] No.
[4540.24 → 4542.02] How does Dell email do you or anything?
[4542.38 → 4544.46] Either I never heard back or,
[4544.46 → 4544.88] uh,
[4544.88 → 4546.44] whoever monitors that email,
[4546.44 → 4546.80] uh,
[4546.80 → 4547.86] never got back to me.
[4548.58 → 4549.10] Um,
[4549.42 → 4550.92] okay.
[4551.10 → 4551.24] Uh,
[4551.24 → 4552.96] I'm trying to remember clarification.
[4553.64 → 4554.12] Um,
[4554.28 → 4557.92] Dell employee email in LTT inbox.
[4558.20 → 4559.86] I emailed them back.
[4560.78 → 4563.14] Did we ever hear back?
[4563.28 → 4563.64] All right.
[4563.88 → 4565.18] Thanks guys for letting me know.
[4565.22 → 4566.48] I'll fire that over to,
[4566.54 → 4568.70] I know Colton at least knows who monitor that inbox.
[4568.70 → 4569.96] So I'll find out what's going on.
[4570.62 → 4570.98] Um,
[4571.18 → 4572.20] what else we got here?
[4573.52 → 4573.96] Uh,
[4573.96 → 4579.26] QWERTY says my fifth week of sending $6 and 90 cents Canadian waiting for Linus to acknowledge it.
[4579.86 → 4580.92] Sorry that took so long.
[4581.42 → 4581.72] Nice.
[4582.16 → 4582.52] Uh,
[4582.52 → 4582.78] okay.
[4583.22 → 4583.70] Uh,
[4583.70 → 4585.22] let's just do a couple more here.
[4586.12 → 4586.50] Um,
[4586.54 → 4590.08] thank you everyone who sent super chats just like in support of,
[4590.08 → 4590.76] uh,
[4590.76 → 4592.80] talking about what's going on with Nvidia,
[4593.18 → 4593.66] um,
[4593.66 → 4594.84] and hardware unboxed.
[4594.84 → 4595.40] Again,
[4595.50 → 4597.12] I'm not doing this for,
[4597.30 → 4599.38] I'm not doing this for dollar bills in my G-string.
[4599.58 → 4603.36] Like the point that I made during that rant stood like,
[4604.14 → 4604.50] you know,
[4604.62 → 4605.08] I,
[4605.08 → 4605.32] I,
[4605.32 → 4606.02] I'm in a
[4606.02 → 4611.72] I'm in a position in my life where I have the luxury of being able to buy my own RTX 3090s if I really feel like it.
[4612.06 → 4614.24] So thank you very much for your support,
[4614.38 → 4616.08] but just know that it's not necessary.
[4616.96 → 4617.32] Um,
[4617.40 → 4619.56] LB says Linus is a paid Nvidia influencer.
[4619.72 → 4620.52] Don't buy the act.
[4620.58 → 4622.16] And many other YouTubers are sellouts.
[4622.26 → 4624.48] Nvidia has always been evil, and now they are exposed.
[4625.04 → 4627.02] So those are serious allegations.
[4627.70 → 4628.72] Those are serious allegations.
[4628.72 → 4629.94] And I know for a fact,
[4630.02 → 4633.78] you don't have any proof of it because you're a dumbass.
[4634.04 → 4635.16] So there's,
[4635.20 → 4635.76] there's that.
[4636.34 → 4636.74] Um,
[4637.30 → 4637.58] yes,
[4637.68 → 4639.36] we have done paid deals with Nvidia,
[4639.62 → 4645.92] but the important thing is that it's all transparent, and the transaction is well understood by not just both sides,
[4646.00 → 4646.88] but also the community.
[4646.88 → 4649.20] That's why transparency is so important to us.
[4649.80 → 4653.34] We did a sponsored piece gaming at 8k on the RTX 3090.
[4653.34 → 4658.24] We were clear to Nvidia that we were going to say exactly only this and this,
[4658.80 → 4660.82] and that we wouldn't say anything we didn't believe.
[4661.10 → 4667.28] Nvidia was clear to us that the money was in exchange for just this video and no other understandings.
[4667.52 → 4670.42] And the community was informed of that business arrangement.
[4670.88 → 4672.50] That is how this works.
[4672.66 → 4673.68] In editorial content,
[4674.10 → 4676.94] no such thing exists.
[4678.54 → 4679.14] Um,
[4679.22 → 4679.66] all right.
[4680.56 → 4681.54] David Lee says,
[4681.54 → 4684.86] first time I've seen you live because time zone wish I joined more often.
[4684.96 → 4685.06] Hey,
[4685.14 → 4685.42] thanks.
[4685.50 → 4685.96] Thanks for,
[4686.14 → 4686.86] thanks for coming in.
[4687.60 → 4687.98] Um,
[4688.14 → 4688.60] all right.
[4688.86 → 4689.18] Yeah.
[4689.18 → 4690.00] Thanks everyone.
[4690.18 → 4692.22] I think I'm just going to go and,
[4692.32 → 4692.42] you know,
[4692.44 → 4693.30] give my kids a hug,
[4693.32 → 4693.56] right?
[4694.34 → 4694.72] Um,
[4694.84 → 4695.46] Pearl says,
[4695.52 → 4695.66] Hey,
[4695.70 → 4697.90] can you please do a video on best PC for music production?
[4698.02 → 4698.34] Actually,
[4698.48 → 4700.10] I haven't replied to the email yet,
[4700.10 → 4700.40] but,
[4700.40 → 4700.42] but,
[4700.42 → 4700.78] uh,
[4701.18 → 4705.80] had a music producer reach out to me saying they would love to help collaborate with
[4705.80 → 4707.16] us to,
[4707.16 → 4708.02] um,
[4708.24 → 4712.66] to create a benchmark that will allow us to evaluate computers performance in music production.
[4712.66 → 4712.96] So,
[4713.06 → 4713.22] yeah,
[4713.28 → 4715.20] we do plan to address that in the near future.
[4715.20 → 4717.58] It's something that we've known for a long time people care about,
[4717.58 → 4723.50] but we just didn't really have the expertise internally to create a meaningful benchmark that
[4723.50 → 4724.74] would be applicable to that audience.
[4724.86 → 4725.16] So we're,
[4725.22 → 4727.86] we're working with that community to create something.
[4728.74 → 4732.74] Thank you for tuning in to the WAN show today.
[4732.94 → 4733.22] Uh,
[4733.22 → 4737.88] hopefully I was able to make myself clear without being,
[4738.30 → 4738.74] um,
[4739.50 → 4741.52] without going over the top.
[4741.58 → 4743.80] It was something that was very close to me today.
[4743.80 → 4744.16] The main,
[4744.18 → 4744.76] the main topic,
[4744.88 → 4745.14] of course,
[4745.20 → 4745.50] I mean,
[4746.02 → 4746.52] um,
[4746.52 → 4747.36] thank you for listening.
[4747.36 → 4748.46] Thank you for understanding.
[4748.82 → 4750.22] And we will see you again next week.
[4750.44 → 4751.20] Same bat time,
[4751.48 → 4753.12] same bad channel.
[4754.14 → 4754.58] Bat.
[4755.24 → 4755.68] Bad.
[4757.32 → 4757.94] Is it?
[4757.98 → 4758.42] It's a bad,
[4758.50 → 4759.16] bad time.
[4759.74 → 4760.18] Oh,
[4760.32 → 4761.22] because we're always late.
[4761.52 → 4762.16] Same bad channel.
[4762.28 → 4762.68] And I'm just,
[4762.76 → 4764.22] it's like self denigrating humour.
[4764.36 → 4764.94] Same bad time,
[4765.06 → 4765.60] same bad channel,
[4765.66 → 4768.12] but it is a reference to 1970s Batman.
[4768.44 → 4769.42] Same bat time,
[4769.66 → 4770.98] same bat channel.
[4771.82 → 4771.98] Yep.
[4772.00 → 4772.16] Yep.
[4772.22 → 4772.42] Okay.
[4772.66 → 4773.02] Bye.
[4773.18 → 4777.30] Back when television shows were aired like at the same time and channel,
[4777.54 → 4779.62] instead of just being on a streaming service.
[4780.46 → 4780.82] Yeah.
[4781.14 → 4781.50] All right.
[4781.52 → 4782.18] There goes the outro.
[4782.38 → 4783.98] along withdraw
[4806.32 → 4809.94] debt
