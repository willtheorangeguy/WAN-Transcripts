[0.00 → 11.38] Welcome my ladies and friendlements to the WAN show. We've got a fantastic show for you guys
[11.38 → 16.90] this week. A lot of great tech topics. Actually not a lot went down, but I definitely want
[16.90 → 23.80] to address the controversy that took place in my Twitter mentions over the weekend. It was a very
[23.80 → 30.16] controversial topic. Me having an SSD that runs faster than the one in the PlayStation 5. There
[30.16 → 36.46] were some people who were pretty mad about that. Very mad. Very mad. Illegal. Not allowed. And I
[36.46 → 44.26] should clarify that there were some aspects of the PS5 SSD that we did in fact fail to mention on last
[44.26 → 50.16] week's episode, but we will get more into that a little bit later. For now let's talk through some
[50.16 → 59.22] of the new topics for the week. We've got Intel's 10th core CPU launch. We've got AMD shifting.
[59.76 → 65.84] They are going to be supporting Zen 3 on their B450 and X470 motherboards. This is a big deal for
[65.84 → 70.36] people who don't like buying new motherboards but do like having faster CPUs. What else we got Luke?
[71.32 → 78.40] Intel acquires rivet networks. Wow, hooray. Also copy and paste. Really? You picked that? In real life.
[78.40 → 84.86] I did. I don't. There's I mean there's news but like. What? Do maternal removed the kernel level
[84.86 → 91.32] Denuvo nonsense? That's kind of a big deal. A corporation listened. Yeah, like. That's news for
[91.32 → 95.82] sure. People play that game for the single player, and it's been out for a little bit so like probably
[95.82 → 101.44] the majority of people have already played it now, and then they removed it. So it's kind of you know.
[101.50 → 106.22] I'm going to let you finish but. It's like it's nice for some people and maybe if some people didn't
[106.22 → 111.04] get it because of that they can get it now which is cool but like yeah it was already running on
[111.04 → 118.12] most of the people's computers. Copy and paste in real life. Super cool, actually. Copy and paste in real life.
[118.22 → 124.52] You can get all that copy pasta. All right. Scissors and glue. Let's roll that intro now that I have
[124.52 → 131.82] actually fixed the YouTube feed, and it's actually live now and get on with the topics. Topics.
[131.82 → 136.82] They're kind of like toppings you know. Like if the WAN show was a pizza. The topics. They're the toppings.
[138.12 → 145.30] Yeah. Make it spicy. And if one of your toppings was Intel buying a company you might be like
[145.30 → 151.52] ugh. Pineapple again. If you don't like pineapple. What? Meanwhile, I love pineapple. You're going to start
[151.52 → 156.48] that. Why would you even bring it up then? Why are you starting that fight? Why are you going to be like
[156.48 → 160.26] that? You know forget it. No, no no. I don't want to hear about it. We're rolling the intro.
[160.26 → 163.80] Some news is interesting. No, the intro's rolling. No, the intro's rolling. I don't even want it.
[168.94 → 169.86] Oh man.
[176.94 → 177.96] Rolling that intro.
[180.70 → 183.60] I don't even care. I don't even care if you don't like pineapple.
[183.60 → 186.26] I do like. It doesn't matter what you think.
[187.06 → 190.32] Well I don't even care if you do now because I don't care what you think anymore. Yeah. Yeah.
[190.44 → 191.96] Yeah. You like that? You like that?
[192.88 → 194.14] Alright. Good counter. Good counter.
[194.24 → 197.78] Alright. Why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day?
[197.78 → 198.12] Yes.
[198.12 → 200.96] Intel's 10th gen core series launch. Now
[200.96 → 208.90] I seem to have created a bit of a fecal storm over this past week for making the somewhat
[208.90 → 215.94] controversial video called why I still love Intel or like I still love Intel whatever I don't remember
[215.94 → 219.28] what I called the video but basically my point.
[219.28 → 220.18] Played a shirt in that video by the way.
[220.42 → 226.90] Thank you. Thank you. I was you know I wanted to wear a blue shirt because I was like you know hey I
[226.90 → 229.78] want to have like a want to have like a blue theme to the video right.
[229.78 → 236.02] Yeah. So I wanted to have a blue shirt and I went through my drawer and literally the only blue shirt
[236.02 → 242.74] that I own is my float plane shirt. And I was like this is great. This is great. So it's called why I
[242.74 → 252.26] still love Intel and I feel like I need to clarify a couple of points for the 41.1% of you that didn't
[252.26 → 263.06] make it through. Oh, no. Sorry. Excuse me. The hold on the 65% of you that didn't make it to the end of
[263.06 → 269.62] the video before leaving a comment. I can see that guys. I can see if you actually finished the video.
[270.26 → 277.94] The point that I was trying to make in the video is that hey guys all the talented hardworking people
[277.94 → 284.02] at Intel. We know that you're not responsible for some of the bad decisions that are being made.
[284.74 → 291.46] Stay the course and keep doing the things that are good about Intel. And then I came out and said
[291.46 → 296.66] some of the things that I like and appreciate about Intel based on my personal experiences
[296.66 → 301.38] and based on numbers that I had access to when I was working at NCI for things like
[301.38 → 307.14] how their reliability compares to their competitors across a number of different spaces.
[307.14 → 312.34] Now there was one Intel product line that I personally had bad experiences with and
[313.22 → 318.58] observed just didn't seem to be very good. That was their motherboards. Well, they ditched them.
[318.58 → 323.22] They ditched them. They're gone. And since then pretty much everything across the board has been
[323.22 → 328.50] rock solid. Now there have been problems. There's, and I acknowledge the problems in the video for those
[328.50 → 333.38] of you who didn't make it to that point of the video and left um actually comments correcting me.
[333.38 → 341.38] Um meltdown big problem. Spectre big problem. Uh the Thunderbolt 3 direct memory access um vulnerability.
[341.38 → 344.18] It's a big problem. We talked about that too. They've had a lot of problems.
[344.82 → 351.78] But what they also have is fewer problems when it comes to most things.
[351.78 → 355.38] Then move your mouse cursor. Move my mouse cursor? Oh, is it in the way?
[355.38 → 360.98] It's on my face. Oh, sorry about that. Oh, really? Oh, that's so weird because your window is actually
[360.98 → 368.10] behind my dock. Oh, I can't see that I'm on your face. Oh, that's so funny. Anyway, so the point was
[368.10 → 375.62] I would, I brought up that I appreciate the actual engineers and Intel still has a ton of great engineers
[375.62 → 381.14] doing great work who are just trying to build the best products that they can, and I lamented
[381.14 → 387.78] the lack of resources that have been given to areas that the business people deemed to be not
[387.78 → 394.98] growth markets things like enthusiast CPUs for gamers. So I think a lot of people got as far as the
[394.98 → 401.46] title got mad because once they're angry the blood pressure rises in their ears, and they can't actually
[401.46 → 408.82] hear anything anymore and then didn't bother to watch the video because it was less about how I'm
[408.82 → 417.54] you know simping Intel which was a popular comment and I definitely wasn't paid. Like anyone who thinks
[417.54 → 425.78] I was paid to make that video has absolutely no idea how sponsored videos work. Also look up like Linus
[425.78 → 433.38] walking in the rain. Just no clue. I mean Intel has been a long time sponsor for us. Yeah. Reality check.
[433.38 → 440.98] So has AMD. So has Nvidia. So has let's see who have we not worked with. Why don't I make a list of
[440.98 → 447.06] companies that we have not done sponsored videos on the rare side of things? No, they've
[447.06 → 451.14] they've done a handful of things lately. They did that 240 fps thing. That was a big project. Oh, yeah.
[451.14 → 455.86] Yeah. Yeah. So here's the list. All right. We got Apple.
[461.70 → 466.34] I mean, guys hit me in the comments. Hit me in the comments. It's like it's a funny thing,
[466.34 → 471.70] right? Because there's sort of two ways you can be unbiased. You can take nobody's money, or you can
[471.70 → 479.06] just take everyone's because I don't GAF like what do I care? Like hit me up here guys.
[479.06 → 484.98] Yeah, it's it. Yeah. I was going to say it's better just doesn't get someone didn't get that it is
[484.98 → 488.58] better to do one or the other. If you're going to take money from some people, you should take money
[488.58 → 494.66] from everyone. Oscar, Oscar LS 91 in float plane chat says Cisco, we have worked with Cisco on
[494.66 → 501.22] multiple occasions. We have worked with Microsoft on multiple occasions. How about red you tinkered with
[501.22 → 505.86] their camera, but did they ever sponsor it? No, red, we have not worked with in a sponsored
[505.86 → 512.02] way, but we have definitely worked with them. Valve. No, no, we have not worked with Cisco.
[512.02 → 519.14] Uh, G skill. Absolutely. We've worked with Cisco and ZXT for sure. Yep. You pretty much name it
[519.14 → 523.14] in the industry. We've pretty much worked with them. Adobe. We have never done G skill.
[523.62 → 529.70] Uh, G skill. We did a, um, a video with their 768 gigs of memory in a single system
[529.70 → 537.30] back at Computer 2019 or 18. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Okay. Yep. Pretty much everyone.
[538.42 → 545.38] IBM. Absolutely. Ubiquity. Yes. We did pimp my neighbour's Wi-Fi. People are like the timing of the
[545.38 → 551.94] video made it a bit suspicious as to the purpose of it. The purpose of it was explicitly stated
[551.94 → 559.86] in the video. The purpose of it was here's what I see in the news. I see dangerous news. I see intel
[559.86 → 566.34] going in a direction that I've seen them go before that could have unforeseen consequences. And I wanted
[566.34 → 572.42] to say, Hey guys, why don't we not do that? Why don't we stick to the things that are good about intel?
[572.42 → 578.34] Keep the products reliable. Take your time, do it properly. Your time to fight the good fight is going
[578.34 → 583.62] to come again. It's not right now. You're still stuck on 14 nanometre plus, plus, plus, plus, plus,
[583.62 → 589.14] or whatever. So, and I said this in the video, I said it explicitly in the video, guys, you need to
[589.14 → 594.34] just take it on the chin for a little bit, stay reliable. Don't even try to be the fastest when you,
[594.34 → 600.10] if you can't do it, don't hurt the reputation with the average consumer. Because what I pointed out in the
[600.10 → 609.06] video is that while things like, um, you know, oh man, like management engine vulnerabilities
[609.06 → 614.82] are going to hurt your reputation with the general, with, with the tech enthusiast, like guys like you
[614.82 → 618.82] or me, we're the ones looking at, you know, Oh, Spectre meltdown. This is, this is terrible.
[618.82 → 624.42] The average consumer, I mean, Luke, you actually had to work on some mitigation stuff for Spectre and
[624.42 → 631.78] meltdown on the float plane side of things. What would be your take on the average consumers impact
[632.82 → 639.06] from those problems? Very, very little, uh, next to none, uh, potentially some services got more
[639.06 → 645.46] expensive or shut down at that time. Um, so you're like access to things might've been slightly annoying.
[645.46 → 650.66] I doubt anyone on the personal side of things was affected basically at all. That's the thing. And so
[650.66 → 657.54] what I brought up in the videos, I said, look, when motherboards are frying, you know, when you take
[657.54 → 663.46] a motherboard out of a case and turn it around and the back of it is like dark brown, okay, all around
[663.46 → 670.58] where the VRMs are, that has the potential to impact the average consumer who just goes to Best Buy and
[670.58 → 675.46] buys a gaming machine with an a core i9 or whatever, because they heard it's the best for gaming.
[675.46 → 685.22] Don't do that. Just be 3% or 5% slower and don't fry a motherboard, right? That's all I was trying to say.
[685.22 → 691.14] And I think people really took it. I think people just kind of took it however they, however they wanted
[691.14 → 697.78] to take it. Um, and a lot of people got it, but it's just, it's one of those things that can be very
[697.78 → 703.38] discouraging to read through the comments on. Um, another thing that was very frustrating and this was just
[703.38 → 707.14] kind of comedy of errors. Because I knew people were already going to be a little bit sensitive around
[707.14 → 712.02] that. We ended up having to, I'll just be a hundred percent upfront with you guys. We ended up having
[712.02 → 718.10] to rush our review of the processors a little bit due to staffing issues around the COVID-19 thing.
[718.10 → 723.38] So I can't, I'm not going to give any specifics. I can't comment on the health of the various people
[723.38 → 726.82] at Linus media group, or, you know, whether they're working in the office or whether they're working
[726.82 → 732.18] from home, that's all personal information. All I can say is that the production of that video
[732.18 → 739.22] was affected by staffing levels and, or people's access to the hardware in a timely manner.
[739.22 → 745.30] And there was one particular error that we really shouldn't have made. Normally we include our, um,
[745.94 → 751.78] our cooler on the test bench slide. Uh, sorry, excuse me. Normally we include it on the graphs because we
[751.78 → 755.54] moved from having it on the test bench slide over to there. And then there was a snafu with the graphs.
[755.54 → 760.10] We had to make some changes, and it was going to be on the graphs this time, but it wasn't. So it
[760.10 → 767.06] wasn't in either of those places. And some people looking for a conspiracy theory figured, oh, we were,
[767.06 → 773.94] we were Intel apologists because we hid that we used the Corsair H110i as our cooler. That was not
[773.94 → 778.26] our intention to hide it. And the only reason that the comment showed up six hours later was because
[778.26 → 783.86] I don't wake up at six in the morning. So someone else launched the video, and it wasn't until much,
[783.86 → 788.50] much later after I had started my work day that I went into the comments, and I was like, holy crap,
[788.50 → 792.58] we didn't have the cooler in the thing. Hey, we need to get a comment on there. We need to get it
[792.58 → 797.22] pinned. Let's get this dealt with. Um, that's the kind of thing that I do end up still having to do
[797.22 → 803.30] myself. Um, even though I wish other people would make those observations. Um, generally speaking,
[803.30 → 811.78] it is kind of time, um, for people to not need me to do that. You know, I, and it is actually in the
[811.78 → 815.62] video publication guide that you need to sit and monitor the video for about 10 minutes,
[815.62 → 818.66] see if people are mad about anything and if there's anything we need to fix, but whatever,
[818.66 → 821.70] it's minor things. I also understand when you wake up at six in the morning, I mean,
[821.70 → 825.54] I used to do it for embargo releases myself. Yeah. I'm up at like six in the morning. I'm like,
[825.54 → 832.82] uh, publish. Yeah. Remember when you couldn't even schedule them? So no matter when someone's
[832.82 → 840.18] embargo lift was, you actually had to wake up and like, in, in their defence a little bit,
[840.18 → 844.66] maybe that comment didn't come in, in the first like 10 minutes or something. That's possible.
[844.66 → 849.06] Um, it's possible. No one even noticed for the first couple hours. I doubt it, but it's possible.
[849.06 → 853.14] I want to throw some companies at you. I know the answer for some of these. Um,
[853.14 → 857.38] sure. Someone, someone mentioned Nintendo. I know the answer for this. Uh, no, we have,
[858.10 → 864.58] we have wrong. Yeah. You did a thing. Yes. That's right. Yes. What about Amazon? Uh, Amazon.
[865.62 → 872.98] Oh man. Okay. So with Amazon, we are an Amazon associates, and it's so funny because you need to
[873.62 → 880.98] like their, their legalese and the agreement is so explicit about how you cannot claim to be
[880.98 → 885.22] affiliated with Amazon. Even though the program, like the, you are, they changed the name of the
[885.22 → 889.94] program. They changed it to Amazon associates a number of years back, but the URL you go to is
[889.94 → 896.18] still like affiliate dash amazon.com or whatever. Like, so it's literally called like the website
[896.18 → 900.74] you go to is literally called Amazon affiliate, but you're not allowed to say you're affiliated with
[900.74 → 908.66] Amazon. So I got to be so careful about how I approach Amazon. Um, yeah, we do make money
[908.66 → 916.90] through having paid links under the videos, but we are not affiliated, sponsored by,
[917.54 → 924.26] or associated directly with Amazon. Even though I have an Amazon associates account, and I go to
[924.26 → 931.70] affiliate dash amazon.com or whatever to get at my dashboard. All right. There. I think that was a
[931.70 → 936.50] safe way to say it because if you don't say it the safe way, they can kick you out of the program
[936.50 → 942.50] and there is literally no appeals process. So I need to be very, very careful, but I will say this,
[942.50 → 946.58] a significant chunk, you can go back and watch our honest answers. How does Linus Media Group make
[946.58 → 952.50] money? A significant chunk of our revenue comes from Amazon, and we have worked with them in like a PR
[952.50 → 958.50] sense. So I did that video down at the, uh, that touchless Amazon store, um, or the count, uh, the
[958.50 → 963.30] counterless one where you just, uh, what's it called? Amazon Go store. Yep. So we've like worked with them in
[963.30 → 969.30] that sense, and we definitely get checks from them once a month. So I don't know. That's a gray area.
[969.30 → 977.46] Gray area. The last one. Yeah. Uh, SK Hynix. Yeah. We've worked with SK Hynix. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I spent actually
[977.46 → 982.74] a while, uh, there were some comments. Does Luke even listen to Linus? I was listening to Linus. I spent a while on
[982.74 → 988.26] New egg trying to find a company that we hadn't worked with and I could not. Yep. Uh, someone brought up
[988.26 → 994.74] Juniper networks before. I don't believe we've ever worked with Juniper networks. All right. I mean,
[994.74 → 1001.54] there are some examples, but like, so back to the 10th gen core launches, um, as it turned out,
[1002.82 → 1010.10] my concerns about Intel's approach to this launch were both validated, but also, um,
[1010.90 → 1016.58] invalidated is kind of how I felt after I saw the real numbers. So I recorded the video about being
[1016.58 → 1022.34] worried about the direction they were going before I had seen any actual confirmed thermal or
[1022.34 → 1031.70] performance numbers. And I was, I was happy to see that on good cooling, even fully unlocked by like
[1031.70 → 1036.42] shaving down the dye, which I don't know if they got the idea from Debater or if he got the idea
[1036.42 → 1041.14] from them that you could actually shave down the dye on the old ones a little bit. Um, anyway,
[1041.14 → 1046.42] they shaved down the dye a little bit. Turns out they got a very significant improvement in
[1046.42 → 1050.90] thermal conductivity through the IHS. They were able to keep the thermals under control using a
[1050.90 → 1056.90] cooling solution that I would consider to be like enthusiast grade, you know, like gamer rig grade
[1056.90 → 1066.50] without being too far over the top. I think, uh, a 280 mid radiator AIO is reasonable if like,
[1066.50 → 1071.86] obviously expensive. Um, so I was pleased to see that, you know, we were running at about 80 degrees,
[1071.86 → 1077.54] even fully unlocked with what I would consider to be a high end, but not, you know, DIY water cooling,
[1078.10 → 1085.30] um, cooler. I was disappointed. Oh, okay. Sorry. The other thing that I was happy about
[1085.30 → 1091.86] was that they didn't make these compromises without even sort of achieving anything. Um,
[1091.86 → 1096.26] they did manage to hold onto the, the gaming performance crown, which I think is something that's
[1096.26 → 1101.46] very important to them. And they, they pulled it off, you know, even if it meant pushing this thing
[1101.46 → 1105.86] to the limit and, you know, good on them, you know, good for you guys. Uh, at least it was,
[1105.86 → 1112.10] it was worth it because we had people point out that I didn't make the same video about AMD back when
[1112.10 → 1116.82] they were getting beat up. I was like, there are a couple issues with that. One is that this was a very
[1116.82 → 1125.22] different channel 10 years ago. Um, you know, so there's that, um, number two is that, you know,
[1125.22 → 1130.58] AMD wasn't, how do I put it this way? Like they weren't in a position where there was like
[1131.22 → 1136.50] something that I still liked about them. And they also weren't even really like still releasing
[1136.50 → 1141.62] stuff. Like, yeah, like it wasn't, it wasn't competitive at all. It was just sort of like,
[1141.62 → 1146.50] yeah, if you're on a super de duper budget, then I guess you could get one of these, even though it's
[1146.50 → 1152.74] both slow and hot, and it's loud too. On top of that. If we want to compare similar situations,
[1152.74 → 1156.90] which it sounds like they're doing where like there's a new processor coming up from that
[1156.90 → 1161.46] company. We were very AMD favourable when they were actually releasing a new processor.
[1161.46 → 1165.62] Well, we were very much being like, yeah, I hope it's great. I hope it's awesome. This is going to
[1165.62 → 1169.62] be great. It's fun to have more competition and all that kind of stuff. So apples to apples. No,
[1169.62 → 1174.42] I think you absolutely did. You're talking about, you're talking about five years ago.
[1174.42 → 1179.78] I'm going back even farther when they were releasing new processors. But my issue was,
[1179.78 → 1183.70] you know, when I talk about the things that I do like about Intel, which is the people,
[1183.70 → 1189.62] like the actual people who do the actual work, not the executive people. I really like the people
[1189.62 → 1194.66] there. And one of my problems with AMD way back in the day, almost no one that I interacted with back
[1194.66 → 1199.46] then is still there. So I'm not too worried about saying this. But some of the people that I worked
[1199.46 → 1207.78] with made it very difficult to like AMD. And it was just stupid things like lying to me, misleading me
[1207.78 → 1211.94] about how good an upcoming product was going to be. Like, I remember this one time,
[1211.94 → 1217.06] I pulled an all-nighter, or it might not have been quite an all-nighter, but nearly an all-nighter,
[1217.06 → 1225.30] trying to work on my, my review of this new CPU. And I was running the testing over and over and over
[1225.30 → 1231.22] again, trying to get the numbers that I was expecting based on what they were telling me,
[1231.22 → 1234.66] they were telling me this thing was going to be awesome. And it was going to overclock like a
[1234.66 → 1238.98] like a bat out of hell. And it was going to, you know, AMD is going to be back in the conversation.
[1240.10 → 1244.42] And it, and it wasn't, and they weren't. And I, and I was doubting my numbers and doubting them and
[1244.42 → 1248.90] doubting them to the point where I stayed up until the embargo lift. And I waited to read someone else's
[1248.90 → 1254.74] review. Because I was still pretty new to the game to see if I was right. And, and I was, and I was just
[1254.74 → 1260.26] like, well, then why didn't you just tell me that it was mediocre next time? Just tell me it's mediocre so
[1260.26 → 1265.46] that we can, cause if you can't live in the same reality, you can't have a conversation,
[1265.46 → 1270.98] right? You can't agree on anything. You know, it's like, if we can't agree that the earth being
[1270.98 → 1275.70] warmer is bad, then how do we have a conversation about, you know, how to address it or like what
[1275.70 → 1282.50] the cause is. Right. Um, so that's, that's why you didn't see that video is a very different
[1282.50 → 1288.26] channel. They didn't make videos like that. Like I didn't consider myself, um, in a position to make
[1288.26 → 1294.66] commentary on my years long observations of these companies. I was just like a junior sales guy at a
[1294.66 → 1300.82] computer store. Um, and then the other issue was, uh, yeah, I just didn't really, I didn't really have
[1300.82 → 1309.06] that argument to make for them. Now back to the AMD of today, who I am like pretty less stoked on.
[1309.94 → 1317.22] They are really, are really putting the gears to Intel here. So back to the 10th gen launch,
[1317.22 → 1322.98] we actually reviewed the 10, uh, the 10, 900 K reasonably favourably. We said, okay, yeah,
[1323.54 → 1332.34] it consumes too much power. Um, it requires a new socket, which blows, but this is what we said at
[1332.34 → 1337.86] the time, at least you don't, uh, sorry. Uh, we said, yeah, it's so it's, but at least it's fast.
[1337.86 → 1344.34] It retains the gaming crown and the performance per dollar doesn't look that bad. Well, okay. Now we got
[1344.34 → 1348.82] a problem because AMD pulled a couple of moves this week. So there was, of course, we'll talk
[1348.82 → 1353.38] about this in more detail later, the move where they're going to allow Zen three to run on B450 and
[1353.38 → 1359.06] X470 boards. That's pretty sick. But the other big one was they actually slashed the pricing
[1359.06 → 1366.98] on their 3,900 X. So that's their 12 core kind of price competitors that have 10, 900 K by a hundred
[1366.98 → 1374.66] dollars. That thing is now 389 at micro centre. I can tell you right now, my conclusion to that
[1374.66 → 1380.50] video would have been pretty different if AMD had dropped that price drop before we worked on the
[1380.50 → 1390.26] review. Holy smokes. I wonder how much that's going to impact things. Because I doubt very many creators
[1390.26 → 1395.38] like there's, there's, there's an audience that watches all the content. There's an audience that
[1395.38 → 1400.50] watches just Sancho, whoever they are. And then there's an audience that are, how's it going?
[1400.50 → 1406.26] Uh, that like basically just watch these like big launch type of things. Yes. They'll probably watch
[1406.26 → 1412.34] like the, the top end NVIDIA card review when it comes out, they'll watch the new top end Intel chip when
[1412.34 → 1418.26] it comes out, top end AMD chip when it comes out. And then mostly just not outside of that, those people
[1418.26 → 1423.46] might not hear about this. Right. I wonder how much that'll change sales.
[1424.42 → 1430.18] You know, I don't know. I mean, uh, it's funny how the audience is kind of segmented into different
[1430.18 → 1437.06] groups like Twitter, you know, loves the dank memes. Whereas Instagram really gets into the like
[1437.70 → 1443.38] great, you know, product shots, and they love the stories over there. Uh, the YouTube audience is kind
[1443.38 → 1447.06] of fragmented in and of itself. Like you said, there's the people that only tune into Sancho and the
[1447.06 → 1451.30] algorithm is so good at knowing what you're likely to click on. So it'll just only serve you the stuff
[1451.30 → 1456.58] you like. I mean, there's people who they'll like comment on a video. They're like,
[1457.54 → 1463.62] why is this got like two sponsors and every video in this video? Like what the F, and I'm like, we have
[1463.62 → 1469.54] had two sponsor spots per video for quite literally years. And I'm not one of those people who throws
[1469.54 → 1478.42] around the word literally for literally years. We have had two sponsors in almost every single video,
[1478.42 → 1485.70] except for ones that are, um, like fully sponsored videos. And then Sancho, which used to have two and
[1485.70 → 1488.26] now has three and has had three for years.
[1490.50 → 1495.78] I think there's maybe been, uh, like the trees video. Was there any on that one?
[1495.78 → 1500.10] Uh, no, that was an exception. So there's some like hyper abnormalities.
[1500.10 → 1503.62] Yes. Where there's like a video here or there every once in a blue moon.
[1503.62 → 1506.10] Yeah. But I was kind of that. That was one of those where it felt
[1506.10 → 1512.42] like kind of in poor taste to have a sponsor for like a, uh, like a charity participation thing.
[1512.42 → 1517.38] So we were like, ah, yeah, let's make this more about giving away money and less about making money.
[1517.38 → 1523.78] But even our April fools' joke this year when I like supposedly am like, you know,
[1523.78 → 1529.70] being still filmed by a whistleblower on the staff. We still managed to, and Riley actually
[1529.70 → 1535.06] pushed back against me on this. He was like, look, I think it's gonna, I think it's going to kill the
[1535.06 → 1538.98] the vibe. I think it's going to kill the believability of it for the people that,
[1538.98 → 1546.34] you know, would fall for it. And I was like, look, man, we got 365 upload slots a year.
[1548.74 → 1553.06] You know if I, if I give the business team a target that says a hundred percent fill rate and they
[1553.06 → 1557.22] don't hit it, you want that hanging on your head. That's what I thought. We're putting the sponsors
[1557.22 → 1563.38] in. We just need to find a way to integrate them in, in like, uh, uh, you know, uh, an unbeknownst
[1563.38 → 1567.94] to Linus, he was being recorded filming a sponsor spot. And we did them in kind of like a flippant,
[1567.94 → 1571.30] you know, well, do I get paid now? You know, like we made it seem like I was,
[1571.94 → 1577.06] I was actually this persona that I was playing for the video. I had so much fun shooting that video, man.
[1577.06 → 1583.94] Dude, I had no idea what was going on. Like when I watched the final like piece,
[1583.94 → 1586.90] Yeah. I remember watching it through the whole time being like, wow,
[1587.70 → 1595.22] I didn't think this is where that was going. No clue at all. I don't remember what I thought it was,
[1595.22 → 1603.14] but I didn't think it was that. Oh, I, it was so much fun. You know, the original script was that Colton
[1603.14 → 1610.18] was going to be, uh, the mastermind, and I was a puppet. That was the original kind of conspiracy
[1610.18 → 1616.42] theory that our whistleblower was, was, was blowing the lid off of. And we had these, we,
[1616.42 → 1622.34] you know, it was actually a perfect script. I, I might, you know what, am I, uh, am I connected?
[1622.34 → 1627.54] I am, I am, I'm connected. I can, I can pull this up. I'm going to pull it up because Riley deserves
[1627.54 → 1632.58] a shout-out for the original version of it. So I don't know. I don't know if I've
[1634.90 → 1639.06] Is that someone said that Luke acted so badly? Yeah. They made me act sad. That just wasn't
[1639.06 → 1645.22] going to work. Oh, so I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Uh, April Fools, 2020. Here it is. Um,
[1646.10 → 1650.26] I remember me saying like, yeah, I don't think I'm going to be able to do a very good job,
[1650.26 → 1653.38] but like, I'll give it a shot, but like, I don't think I'm going to be able to do this very well.
[1653.38 → 1658.34] And then someone going back and talking to Linus and I could overhear Linus being like,
[1658.34 → 1659.78] yeah, he's not going to be able to do that.
[1662.02 → 1667.86] I know your acting skills, man. I know. I know. So, uh, so they brought me, uh, Riley brought me an
[1667.86 → 1672.50] early version of the script and I don't know how much you guys know about our process, but I actually,
[1672.50 → 1677.06] I actually got in sort of, a semi tiff with someone on the forum about this a little while ago,
[1677.06 → 1683.06] because they basically accused me of being like, you know, the anchorman, right. Uh, from the Will Ferrell movie,
[1683.06 → 1686.58] you know, just, I just read whatever's put in front of me and I actually have no idea what I'm
[1686.58 → 1695.46] talking about. And so I was like, okay, okay. Okay. Um, here's my deal then. Why don't I just post
[1696.18 → 1700.82] and I posted a raw script that one of the writers and I didn't name any names, but that one of the
[1700.82 → 1705.54] writers brought me and I posted the finished script side by side? I was like, okay, you go ahead. You
[1705.54 → 1712.90] tell me that I don't actually take my position as editor-in-chief here. Seriously. Almost every script on
[1713.06 → 1720.10] LTT and tech wiki for the past two to three years has been reviewed by me before anyone read it.
[1720.10 → 1724.58] There are exceptions, anything that is vlogged. Obviously I can't review something that wasn't
[1724.58 → 1730.18] pre-written and tech wiki has been more of a John James tandem over the last couple of months.
[1730.18 → 1737.30] But up until that point, I am reading this stuff, uh, and I'm working on it, and I'm often making a lot
[1737.30 → 1742.98] of changes because I feel like as the person who has as much experience as most of the writing team
[1742.98 → 1749.78] combined doing this, I'm still in a position where I can do that. Um, I want that to change.
[1749.78 → 1754.66] Like I want the day to come where they tell me, no, look, this is how it needs to be done. And I'll go,
[1754.66 → 1759.38] you know what? I defer to you because you get it right more often than I do these days. Um, and some
[1759.38 → 1762.66] of them are getting like perfect. And I'm not going to name any names because I wouldn't talk about
[1762.66 → 1767.94] an HR thing, like on a live stream like this, but, um, you know, I'm still in a position where I feel
[1767.94 → 1773.22] like I do need to make a lot of changes. Anyway, here's, here's a couple, a couple little fun bits
[1773.22 → 1777.22] from the original, the original script. So the scene is, this is how it would open. The scene is
[1777.22 → 1781.86] writers meeting. Linus is wrapping up the meeting, dismissing everyone. People file out the camera
[1781.86 → 1786.66] still low, follows Linus back to the writer's room, stays back as Linus goes into the office.
[1786.66 → 1792.10] The camera slowly moves towards his office, revealing Linus standing still, facing away from the camera.
[1792.10 → 1797.30] He's just standing there. Creepy music builds up as the camera slowly zooms in. Then Linus suddenly
[1797.30 → 1803.06] moves towards his desk and the camera jerks away. We hear a bass hit, cut to black. It's like the way
[1803.06 → 1810.50] Riley had this written was so cool. Um, and then at the end of it, uh, okay, here we go. So the
[1810.50 → 1812.82] the scene in my office, do you remember that scene, Luke?
[1812.82 → 1812.90] Luke?
[1812.90 → 1814.90] Luke Davis
[1814.90 → 1816.82] I, I think so.
[1816.82 → 1822.02] Okay. So, uh, I'm reading like, uh, I'm reading like Asus DOG reboot.
[1822.02 → 1822.66] Luke Davis
[1822.66 → 1823.22] Yes. Okay. Yeah.
[1823.22 → 1823.30] Luke Davis
[1823.30 → 1826.98] Yeah. And James tells me to get the script. And then I, I like flip out at him. I'm like,
[1826.98 → 1833.46] look, if you want me to say DOG, then you need to put DOG on the script. Okay.
[1834.18 → 1837.70] And I like throw down the paper or whatever. I tell him to redo it or something like that.
[1838.34 → 1840.66] Here's the original version of that scene.
[1840.66 → 1841.30] Luke Davis
[1841.30 → 1847.06] Uh, overhead security cam footage. Linus practicing script with Colton. Linus holding script.
[1847.06 → 1851.86] Hey guys, welcome to this year's DOG rig reboot. The, and then Colton interrupts and goes,
[1851.86 → 1858.90] no, damn it. Linus. It's R O G not DOG. You idiot. You absolute NumPy. And Colton walks out.
[1858.90 → 1861.70] And then I go like, Oh Geez, Colton. That's how it's spelled.
[1861.70 → 1862.34] Luke Davis
[1862.34 → 1869.70] So the original concept was actually that Colton is like the mastermind behind this whole thing.
[1869.70 → 1874.98] And I'm a total puppet. And the joke is the same that I actually don't know how to build a computer.
[1874.98 → 1879.06] I don't know anything about PCs, but the punchline is different. And I was like,
[1879.06 → 1889.22] Okay, guys, I just don't think Colton has the acting stones and they, oh man, I want to find the thing they had written for you.
[1890.02 → 1895.86] Let me see if I've got it. Okay, here we go. Uh, Want Chose, Linus and Luke.
[1895.86 → 1901.54] Uh, wait, no, actually your lines were still the same. He talked, he talked me into keeping yours.
[1901.54 → 1908.10] Man, when Riley showed me how he wanted you to do it. I wanted this 10 years ago. I just
[1913.22 → 1919.78] Never going to work. Oh, I love it. Oh, I thought it was great. I thought it was great. Oscar goes to
[1920.34 → 1925.46] Luke Cafetière. Oh, no. Oh, no. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it.
[1926.18 → 1930.66] Um, that's one of those where like the actor doesn't show up because they're like, I'm not going to win this.
[1930.66 → 1932.66] They're not that dumb.
[1934.74 → 1942.10] All right. Uh, 10th gen launch. Uh, what are, what are we talking about? Um, yeah, I mean,
[1942.10 → 1946.98] I guess we already talked through the 10th gen stuff. So, uh, oh, right. The other thing, right.
[1946.98 → 1951.46] Now I have one more point to make about that. The last thing that I said in that, uh, that,
[1951.46 → 1957.46] that I thought was really important that I think people overlooked was the part, um, from the, uh,
[1957.46 → 1963.70] what I still love about Intel from that video was the part where I said, like, look, um,
[1964.42 → 1969.14] you know, the people who are savvy, I pointed out, I am, I am running AMD almost everywhere. Now.
[1969.14 → 1976.26] Uh, the people who are savvy are going to, uh, wait, what? Oh, Anthony's putting stuff in the
[1976.26 → 1981.86] in the doc right now. Okay. I'll, I'll address that later, Anthony. Um, the point that I made was like,
[1981.86 → 1986.90] I'm running AMD and for an enthusiast like you, and I even specifically said like you, the viewer,
[1986.90 → 1991.94] I'm recommending AMD, but when it comes to a more mainstream person that I just like never
[1991.94 → 1996.74] want to hear from about this computer again, I'm more likely. And I said, more likely,
[1996.74 → 2001.86] I didn't say guarantee. AMD makes great stuff. I just said, I'm more likely to say, yeah,
[2001.86 → 2007.62] just get the Intel one because there are issues that you can run into around things like the
[2007.62 → 2013.22] the USB chip set that's built into your motherboard that, you know, it's been a
[2013.22 → 2019.54] it's been a long time since, um, you know, Intel's made a USB chip set. That's been, you know,
[2019.54 → 2025.94] problematic is what I'll say. I actually kind of wish that Intel sold their USB controllers
[2025.94 → 2031.78] just on standalone cards rather than having to put an as media one, or, um, you know what I've actually
[2031.78 → 2037.46] had perfect reliability with or perfect consistency from, I still have some of those
[2037.46 → 2044.90] ancient NEC USB controller cards. Do you remember like the first USB 3 cards? Yeah.
[2044.90 → 2051.06] Man, if I just need something to work, I go get one of those, throw that in a PCIe slot, and I'm humming.
[2051.94 → 2057.46] It's happening. It's good stuff. Yeah. Sometimes I just want stuff to work.
[2057.46 → 2062.74] Muddle Dick says, prove this is live. Well, that's how it's pronounced. What do you want from me?
[2062.74 → 2069.62] All right. I will acknowledge Anthony's note now. Anthony's note with Zen three around the corner.
[2069.62 → 2076.18] AMD seems to be playing for market share first and profit second. Yep. The 3,900 X is a crazy value
[2076.74 → 2081.38] with that latest price drop. Holy shrikes. Like that's what I'm running in my rig here. I can use
[2081.38 → 2087.46] NV ENC encoding. I can just use X264 encoding when I'm streaming. It just doesn't give any cares. That
[2087.46 → 2092.82] thing chews through anything. And Anthony also asks, do I get full marks for not including our
[2092.82 → 2101.14] own review in the WAN doc this time? He included Nantes and Gamers Nexus who probably, yeah, did do
[2101.14 → 2107.22] a more thorough job than we did this time around. So there's that. All right. Let's move on to our
[2107.94 → 2114.02] sponsors. Ridge Wallet. Stop carrying around pointless items in your pocket, like receipts,
[2114.02 → 2118.42] old hotel room keys, or spent gift cards. Let's face it. We've all done it at some point. Ridge
[2118.42 → 2123.30] Wallet helps you carry less. They use two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band,
[2123.30 → 2127.54] keeping your cards tightly together, but still accessible. The plates are RRHD blocking. They
[2127.54 → 2132.66] offer a lifetime guarantee, and they're available in aluminum, carbon fibre, and titanium. They also
[2132.66 → 2136.42] don't just sell wallets. They've got battery banks, bags, smartphone covers, and more. And they make
[2136.42 → 2143.38] a great gift for Father's Day. Holy crap, it's Father's Day coming up. I'm good though. I'm good though.
[2143.38 → 2147.14] Are you ready for Father's Day, Luke? Are you going to get him a hammer? Are you going to get him a
[2147.14 → 2154.98] hammer, Luke? No, I do not think there will be a hammer. You don't want a Kickstarter hammer?
[2155.54 → 2159.78] The best hammer you ever did see? Use offer code Linus. Save 10% at Ridgewallet.com.
[2160.98 → 2164.34] All right. Sorry. You can talk about your hammer now. I'll do the last sponsor after. Tell me about the
[2164.34 → 2167.86] hammer. No, no. I'm just going to go see if there's an update. Hit me with that hammer.
[2167.86 → 2171.86] Hit me with the hammer. You're checking? You're checking the up? Okay. I'll do the PIA spot while you check for an
[2171.86 → 2176.42] update on that Kickstarter. Private internet access. What's in your online security toolkit?
[2176.42 → 2182.34] Adding a VPN lets you mask your IP and encrypt traffic to and from your devices. PIA has reliable
[2182.34 → 2188.98] service with over 3,300 servers in 30 countries. And they now feature WireGuard and no bandwidth caps.
[2188.98 → 2194.10] They've got configurable encryption and an internet kill switch to keep you in control of your connection.
[2194.10 → 2198.66] And you can try it out risk-free with their 30-day money back Guaranty.
[2199.62 → 2207.22] Check it out at leg.GG slash PIA when. Also, PIA just launched their own weekly privacy news online show,
[2207.22 → 2210.66] which covers the most important privacy news every week. If you're interested, check it out
[2210.66 → 2211.70] down below as well.
[2211.70 → 2215.86] Hey, are they advertising their show on our show? Are they a competitor now?
[2215.86 → 2223.54] You know what, PIA? I've had enough of your nonsense. I've had enough of your attitude.
[2223.54 → 2228.50] Look at these guys. We'll just make our own show and talk about privacy. Look at these guys.
[2228.98 → 2232.18] I don't actually have fixed talking points for them. I can kind of say whatever I want,
[2232.18 → 2236.90] as long as you guys just keep signing up for PIA. So yeah, go check them out at the link in the video.
[2238.66 → 2241.14] All right. Tell me about your hammer, Luke. It's hammer time.
[2241.14 → 2246.66] I don't think there's been an update. I think the last update was from February 5th, 2020.
[2246.66 → 2247.86] Stop. Hammer time.
[2247.86 → 2248.66] Hey.
[2248.66 → 2249.06] Oh!
[2249.70 → 2254.98] And I think that one was mentioned on Sancho already. So I think the coal bar hammer still has no...
[2254.98 → 2256.82] Yeah, this is the same update as before.
[2256.82 → 2260.66] Okay. Well, that's a shame. All right. Do you want to talk us through the next thing?
[2260.66 → 2264.02] I feel like I've actually been talking a lot. I'm sorry. Have I not let you talk today?
[2264.02 → 2265.94] Did I do that again? I'm sorry.
[2265.94 → 2269.86] I think today's been better than last week. Last week was a boozy.
[2269.86 → 2276.02] Wow. All right. Well, why don't you pick a topic and walk us through it?
[2276.02 → 2276.98] Okay.
[2276.98 → 2279.94] I just got sick burned. Right there. You saw it.
[2279.94 → 2283.06] Copy-paste in real life. You can't even do the topic title.
[2287.06 → 2291.70] Copy-paste in real life. You need to screen share this. The Twitter link screen share is probably the
[2291.70 → 2299.30] best one. Super, super cool. It's an AR prototype thing. The prototype code allows the user to take
[2299.30 → 2306.42] pictures of objects. It snips the object out and then allows you to paste them directly into it.
[2306.42 → 2311.94] It says here, Photoshop. I thought it looked like something else, but whatever. The creator...
[2311.94 → 2316.26] Oh, I'm going to butcher your name. I am very sorry. Cyril Miami.
[2316.26 → 2317.46] Sure. Cool.
[2317.46 → 2326.26] It uses Basset boundary-aware salient object detection to identify and cut out objects where it
[2326.26 → 2333.86] picks one specific object out of your picture and is able to place them into Photoshop. Right now,
[2333.86 → 2337.94] it takes about 2.5 seconds to cut and about four seconds to paste, but there's this cool little
[2337.94 → 2345.06] animation thing. What the F? There are tons of ways to speed up the whole flow. This is relatively early
[2345.06 → 2351.70] on. The popularity of the original tweet prompted Cyril to take the code from prototype to app and
[2351.70 → 2365.38] currently has a splash page up for requesting access at acropypaste.app. So A-R-C-O-P-Y-paste.app.
[2365.38 → 2371.46] That is really cool. That's some future-y stuff right there. Not going to lie.
[2372.34 → 2381.62] I love it. Super, super cool. I love it. ARCopyPaste.app. There you go. ARCopyPaste.app.
[2381.62 → 2387.30] Oh my goodness. That's what it is. I thought he was trying to do like pies in Python.
[2387.30 → 2389.22] Yeah, you're dyslexia showing Luke.
[2391.38 → 2391.94] Acre...
[2394.50 → 2396.42] Acropypaste.com.
[2399.86 → 2402.98] You're great. This is why I love you. Oh my god. This is why I don't talk.
[2406.02 → 2408.74] Well, you can talk. It's just the reading and talking.
[2408.74 → 2409.94] Yeah, it's a bit of an issue.
[2409.94 → 2412.50] Yeah, the Teleprompter used to be a real struggle for him.
[2412.98 → 2413.86] It was really hard.
[2413.86 → 2414.50] Well, it doesn't...
[2414.50 → 2416.42] I had to basically... Oh, my.
[2416.98 → 2420.90] I had to basically memorize, like pre-memorize so I could read one or two words, and then I would
[2420.90 → 2422.74] just know in my head the whole rest of the thing.
[2422.74 → 2426.50] Well, some of your problems were sort of self-inflicted. You know, the fact that you
[2426.50 → 2427.70] wouldn't get glasses.
[2428.34 → 2428.74] Yeah.
[2428.74 → 2429.46] You know, you couldn't see.
[2429.46 → 2431.06] Yeah, I have them.
[2431.06 → 2436.82] He's a touch dyslexic, and he's trying to read this thing and talk at the same time
[2436.82 → 2440.98] and he doesn't get glasses. I don't think I've ever seen you wear glasses.
[2441.62 → 2441.86] Yeah.
[2442.50 → 2443.46] When did you get those?
[2443.46 → 2445.30] Wow, it's weird. I haven't worn these in a while, so...
[2446.90 → 2450.90] The most ironic thing is that there's been a significant period of time in his life when
[2450.90 → 2457.78] a significant person in his orbit was heavily involved in glasses and the glasses' industry
[2457.78 → 2462.50] and he still didn't have any bloody glasses. When did you even get those?
[2464.50 → 2469.06] Right before a job change because it like made the most sense. Not my job change.
[2469.06 → 2470.58] Got it. Got it. That makes sense.
[2470.58 → 2472.50] The other people... Yes. Yeah.
[2472.50 → 2472.90] Got it.
[2473.38 → 2476.58] They are 100% not needed for the computer, so I'm going to take them off now. But yeah,
[2476.58 → 2480.82] these are my glasses. I had a hard time picking frames for a long time.
[2480.82 → 2481.38] You look smart.
[2481.38 → 2484.02] And then I went to a football game with my dad.
[2484.02 → 2484.26] Yeah.
[2484.26 → 2487.22] And I was like, his glasses are cool. I want those.
[2487.22 → 2488.42] Seriously, that was it.
[2489.30 → 2491.94] Yeah, that was it. They're the exact same frames.
[2491.94 → 2492.98] Remember football games?
[2494.02 → 2495.70] Yeah. It's weird. It's been a long time.
[2495.70 → 2498.90] It's been kind of rough, eh? Like not going out.
[2499.78 → 2500.18] Yeah.
[2500.18 → 2502.90] Hey, my badminton gym is finally opening up next week.
[2503.78 → 2504.18] Oh, wow.
[2504.18 → 2509.30] Yeah, it's going to cost almost twice as much to go because they've got like hard limits on
[2509.30 → 2512.50] the number of people that are allowed in the facility and per court.
[2512.50 → 2517.94] Right. So is it going to be... I'm assuming it's not drop in courts anymore. I don't remember what
[2517.94 → 2520.26] you call that, but you rent a whole court now, I'm assuming.
[2520.26 → 2526.34] Yeah, doing court rentals or lessons. So I was actually supposed to start doing badminton training
[2526.34 → 2531.38] again, like right before this whole thing went down. So I'm actually starting my class now. I'm
[2531.38 → 2532.02] really excited.
[2532.02 → 2533.78] Oh, cool. Nice.
[2534.98 → 2539.62] All right. Why don't we have a look at what else we've got here today? I wanted to talk about
[2540.58 → 2549.30] AMD listening. Zen 3 to support B450 and X470. This is a huge deal. This was posted on the forum by...
[2550.58 → 2556.42] It didn't get filled out by whoever... by Tenney. Tenney on the forum. AMD reversed its decision to
[2556.42 → 2561.62] limit the BIOSes on 400 series chipsets. Here's an excerpt from the statement. We heard our audience
[2561.62 → 2565.94] and we understand the concerns. We're going to work out a way to support Zen 3 on our 400 series
[2565.94 → 2570.34] chipsets between now and launch. We're still working on the what and the how, but we will update you
[2570.34 → 2572.58] closer to the Zen 3 launch. That's pretty freaking awesome.
[2572.58 → 2574.42] That's quite the commitment.
[2574.42 → 2577.94] I was already at the point where I would have forgiven them and I would have said,
[2577.94 → 2582.10] Hey, you know what? As far as I can tell from everything I've seen, you guys really,
[2582.10 → 2588.34] you did your best and I understand if you just need to... if you need to shed some dead weight
[2588.34 → 2592.58] in order to bring us the very best Zen 3 that you can. If they had said that, I'd have said,
[2593.62 → 2602.58] okay, cool. But this is even better. This is great. This means that anyone who invested in even a B450 board
[2602.58 → 2608.26] is going to be moving into the freaking future here. Now, we don't know, you know, what this is going to
[2608.26 → 2613.78] mean for, you know, because is... wait, is Zen 3 rumoured to be DDR5?
[2616.66 → 2617.54] Let me have a look here.
[2621.70 → 2625.46] No, I don't think so. It looks like Zen 4 is supposed to be DDR5.
[2629.30 → 2633.46] Yeah, okay. Yeah, no, we have no indication that they're going to be moving away from that. So either way,
[2633.46 → 2640.02] people who got a B450 board like, you know, year two years ago, they're going, they're going Zen 3.
[2640.02 → 2644.18] We are expecting Zen 3 to be a very significant performance uplift compared to Zen 2.
[2645.54 → 2650.18] Just based on what we know about it so far. And I personally am pretty, pretty jazzed.
[2651.30 → 2654.82] Yeah. I mean, yeah. What else? What else is there to say? They've still got six plus months.
[2656.90 → 2661.94] The cool thing is that AMD is finally in this position where they're not desperate, right?
[2661.94 → 2667.54] Like there was no doubt in my mind that first gen Ry zen was rushed. It was super rushed.
[2667.54 → 2668.42] Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[2668.42 → 2673.94] It was the kind of thing that, you know, I was, well, my whole, why I still love Intel. It was like
[2674.58 → 2679.70] what I was telling Intel, hey, make sure you don't do this. Because that launch was a whole different
[2679.70 → 2686.26] level of buggy. There were problems up and down the product stack and throughout the entire ecosystem.
[2686.26 → 2692.18] It was the kind of product that I reviewed positively, but from like, hey, I can see the
[2692.18 → 2698.34] potential here standpoint, not from a like, hey, the experience that I had holding this product
[2698.34 → 2701.46] right now was very good, and you should buy it kind of standpoint.
[2701.46 → 2706.74] And a lot of people held off buying it because of that. But I think also like, even with hindsight,
[2706.74 → 2708.74] that was probably the right move for AMD at the time.
[2708.74 → 2711.54] Oh, well, they had no choice. What choice did they have? They had no money.
[2711.54 → 2717.38] Yeah. But what's cool is AMD is now in a position where even six months from now,
[2717.38 → 2723.94] they can confidently say Intel won't have some kind of random ace up their sleeve to compete with
[2723.94 → 2732.10] Zen 2 Plus or excuse me, with Zen 2 in their Ry zen 3, Ry zen 3 gen series. So,
[2733.22 → 2735.78] okay, if it takes us another month, then we'll just spend another month.
[2735.78 → 2745.62] Oh, wow.
[2745.62 → 2750.66] Wow. No, it was longer ago than that. Holy crap. When was the Athlon X2? It was like 15 years ago.
[2750.66 → 2753.30] Oh, wow.
[2755.30 → 2757.30] When did I get like old, Luke?
[2757.30 → 2760.82] Yeah.
[2761.94 → 2770.34] Dual core desk. April 2005. It was almost exactly 15 years ago. Holy bananas. I hate this. This sucks.
[2770.34 → 2771.46] Um, anyway.
[2771.46 → 2776.98] Can you believe it's, it's, it's almost freaking, uh, June and we're still stuck inside?
[2776.98 → 2777.54] Wow.
[2777.54 → 2777.94] Anyway.
[2777.94 → 2779.14] So most motherboards,
[2779.14 → 2784.58] most motherboards have 16 legs of onboard storage and CPUs can only address the first 16
[2784.58 → 2789.54] legs of a BIOS chip. So we might see an issue where 400 series motherboards end up having two
[2789.54 → 2796.34] forked BIOSes, kind of like what we've seen already. So one for up to Ry zen 3000 inclusive
[2796.34 → 2801.86] and one for Ry zen 3000 and beyond. So the former would likely be a default BIOS, which would be picked
[2801.86 → 2805.38] because I mean, people who have the older stuff, I guess, would be less likely to just kind of have
[2805.38 → 2810.74] extra stuff on hand. Maybe that's the rationale. I'm not sure. Um, so the former would likely be
[2810.74 → 2815.06] the default, which would be picked up by an auto update. However, the latter could be like a beta
[2815.06 → 2820.26] BIOS or a secondary BIOS and would require user intervention. I ran into this recently on a B450
[2820.26 → 2825.46] board that I wanted to put Ry zen third gen on even. So AMD will enable the ODM partners with the
[2825.46 → 2830.42] feature. However, it will be up to the actual motherboard manufacturer to enable it as a feature
[2830.42 → 2835.14] on that motherboard or on that prebuilt system. Um, if they're, so if they're not willing to
[2835.14 → 2840.34] complicate matters with this weird BIOS fork thing, then unfortunately you are plum out of luck.
[2840.34 → 2845.06] It is believed that most of the vendors are going to be on board, are going to want to be on board
[2845.06 → 2849.22] straight away. Um, and then the rest will probably have to follow because what choice are you going
[2849.22 → 2853.86] to have? Right? Like you don't want to be the one that's like the only one that screwed your customers
[2853.86 → 2862.10] with backwards or forwards compatibility. It's not a great look. Oh, what else we got in here that's
[2862.10 → 2869.54] important. Tiger Lake first Tiger Lake laptop, the shift 13. Oh, okay. Tiger Lake is Intel's upcoming
[2869.54 → 2875.78] mobile CPU line. This was posted in the, uh, doc by Alex probably because he's usually into that stuff.
[2875.78 → 2879.46] According to Intel, Tiger Lake will be using technology from their dedicated graphics project.
[2879.46 → 2886.74] So this would be, uh, Intel XC graphics, and we could see a two times improvement in integrated
[2886.74 → 2891.62] GPU performance over ice lake, which was already a massive jump. Intel has made gigantic strides
[2891.62 → 2895.38] in graphics performance over the last few generations, and this could finally make them
[2895.38 → 2901.94] competitive with AMD's Vega GPUs. Of course, by that time, AMD could be doing some kind of, uh, next
[2901.94 → 2908.98] generation GPUs. So we'll see. That's the thing about technology, right? The bar just keeps moving.
[2908.98 → 2914.58] There'll be several GPU units with 48, 80, and 96 execution units. And the 3D Mark Fire strike
[2914.58 → 2919.14] results from notebook check looks like the 48 EU version will be coming on new i3 processors and is
[2919.14 → 2926.26] 20% faster than the current ice lake i's. Pretty cool stuff. So the low end is faster than the old
[2926.26 → 2934.50] high end. Love it. What else we got here? Oh, yeah. Denuvo anti-cheat. Um, there's a couple kind of big
[2934.50 → 2940.10] deal things. So Denuvo anti-cheat is going to support Steam Play Proton. That's kind of awesome.
[2940.10 → 2946.90] Very cool. Yeah. So Linux gamers have been dealing with anti-cheat mucking up games that would otherwise
[2946.90 → 2951.54] work. Like there's no reason the game can't work other than that the anti-cheat software doesn't
[2951.54 → 2959.14] understand that it's running on Linux and blocks it. Um, so this is, this is pretty cool. Um, but Doom Eternal is
[2959.14 → 2963.86] also just removing the kernel level Denuvo anti-cheat. So maybe it's some other kind of
[2963.86 → 2968.98] Denuvo anti-cheat that's going to be helpful in this case. Anyway, they added it on May the 14th,
[2968.98 → 2973.62] and here we are only eight days later, and they have committed to getting rid of it.
[2973.62 → 2980.02] Which is great because it's like been horrible for almost every game it's been part of.
[2980.74 → 2985.70] Yeah, that's neat. Um, so the reason they chose it was to protect battle mode players from cheaters.
[2985.70 → 2990.50] This is, this is from, um, the Doom Subreddit executive producer. Yeah, go ahead.
[2990.50 → 2995.06] That whole argument is getting messy right now because they're like, there's the, the ring zero
[2995.06 → 3005.86] anti-cheat that Riot has put out. Yeah. And like, there's still hackers in Valorant. So, you know,
[3005.86 → 3014.58] root kidding everyone's computer that has your game and still being ineffective is really not a great
[3014.58 → 3021.62] look. Um, I mean, how is that? I, you don't get, just riddle me this, riddle me this. How is it that
[3021.62 → 3026.42] you get all the way down to kernel level, and you still can't block people from cheating?
[3028.26 → 3035.06] Um, just not being able to detect the cheat, I guess. Like there's, there's a lot of, um,
[3035.06 → 3039.86] input modes. I know like there's also different types of cheating. This is jumping to a different
[3039.86 → 3046.58] game, but escape from Markov. Yeah. Uh, the main cheat or hack or whatever that I know of runs on a
[3046.58 → 3053.14] different computer. Right. It's not even detectable. Like it's a completely different
[3053.14 → 3058.02] computer. I don't know. You may be a VPN, the computer or something. Uh, and what are you going
[3058.02 → 3063.22] to do? It's, it's a different, it's not even the same computer. Right. So like, what does it do?
[3063.22 → 3066.42] I actually don't know much about escape from Markov at all to be honest with you.
[3066.42 → 3071.70] Escape from Markov. Well, okay. So escape from Markov, it's an interesting game, relatively unique. I like
[3071.70 → 3077.30] it a lot, but your, your whole idea is you get dropped into a certain area, not dropped as in
[3077.30 → 3081.86] the battle Royal fly out of a plane thing, but you, you spawn in a certain area, you want to loot
[3081.86 → 3086.18] and kill as many people as possible and then escape. Yeah. There's an exit somewhere and you
[3086.18 → 3089.70] have to get to it because you generally across the other side of the map. And then if you lose your
[3089.70 → 3095.14] gear, it's permanent, right? That's kind of the idea. If you, if you spawn in as your like private
[3095.14 → 3100.10] military contractor, you have a little box that you can store a very small amount of certain items in.
[3100.10 → 3104.98] Yeah. But you're like your weapons, your, your big weapons, your armour, all that kind of stuff
[3104.98 → 3111.22] doesn't fit inside of it. So you lose generally all of your things. So if you're like keys or maps or
[3111.22 → 3117.06] other small items that you want to save in your, in your case. But so, so death is super
[3117.78 → 3123.46] detrimental and people are very careful and quiet and, and methodical in this game. Sure. And this
[3123.46 → 3128.18] cheat thing, as far as I know, makes this, you can see where people are aiming, and you can see them
[3128.18 → 3135.70] through walls across the map. Wow. Okay. And like death is that bad. Having that level of cheating
[3135.70 → 3142.18] is brutal. Right. I don't, in my gameplay, I don't think I personally ran into it a ton. It doesn't
[3142.18 → 3148.26] really feel like it, but there are clips online of people that are like, there are clips of people on
[3148.26 → 3154.26] Twitch that will like to look away from their monitor because it's on a different computer. So it's not
[3154.26 → 3159.14] on their actual screen. So they have to look somewhere else. So they'll look somewhere else.
[3159.14 → 3163.70] Not there's clearly nothing on their screen and the people watching the stream can hear the audio.
[3163.70 → 3166.90] So they know there's, there's no information coming to them that there's someone there.
[3166.90 → 3170.02] And they're like, oh, there's, there's five people coming in this direction.
[3170.02 → 3174.90] Like, uh, it's brutal. I don't, there are cheaters in, in like every game.
[3176.74 → 3182.18] Don't rootkit people's computers in my opinion. All right. So back to their rationale. They said,
[3182.18 → 3187.22] okay, kernel level integrations are typically the most effective in preventing cheating. Okay. And
[3187.22 → 3192.26] Denuvo's integration met our standards for security and privacy. Players were disappointed on that Doom
[3192.26 → 3198.18] 2016 was so delayed in adding anti-cheat technology. And then basically went on to say, despite our best
[3198.18 → 3203.06] intentions, feedback from players made it clear that we must reevaluate our approach to anti-cheat
[3203.06 → 3207.38] integration in the next patch. We will be removing it. Um, but it will return for players who want to
[3207.38 → 3212.10] stay on to, to play online and won't be required for a single player. So there you go.
[3213.94 → 3220.18] And I think that's pretty much all the most interesting stuff from today. Oh, G2A confirms that
[3220.18 → 3225.38] stolen game keys are sold on the platform. Like, okay. They hired the yeah, it's in tech link today.
[3225.38 → 3230.34] They apparently had to hire, uh, an independent investigator to, you know, audit them. They
[3230.34 → 3234.98] were like, yeah, we want an independent investigation. And yeah, they found that,
[3234.98 → 3241.30] um, about 198, yeah, a couple of hundred factorial keys were found to have been sold illegitimately on
[3241.30 → 3249.22] G2A, um, out of a list of 321 keys. So 198 doesn't sound like a lot until it's two thirds of them.
[3249.22 → 3260.18] Oops. That's brutal. So they, they paid them out. Uh, they paid the factorial developers out at
[3260.18 → 3265.70] 10X. They, 10X the money that they lost via chargebacks, whatever that ended up being.
[3265.70 → 3269.06] Yeah. Um, they paid them back roughly 40,000 US dollars.
[3269.06 → 3275.78] Yeah. Hilarious. Uh, Room Software is apparently the first and only developer to take GTA, uh, uh,
[3275.78 → 3285.62] G2A up on its limited time offer to conduct these, uh, uh, these investigations. So funny.
[3286.66 → 3293.22] So it turns out the thing everyone knew is a thing. So now we know more. Yeah. Which is great. Yep.
[3294.18 → 3299.30] Speaking of things we know more, it's definitely time to know more about what kind of super chats
[3299.30 → 3304.82] you guys have been sending. As usual, I will only be doing a few of them. I have no idea why you guys
[3304.82 → 3311.70] even send them because I read like a fraction of them and this is a well known behaviour. Actually,
[3311.70 → 3315.94] it's not even loading. The tabs, not even loading in the YouTube dashboard because it's so great.
[3317.14 → 3321.14] It's so great. And I love it so much. Let's see if they're even still there. If I refresh the page,
[3321.86 → 3326.18] that would be a challenge. I mean, one solution to this problem would be to just read them right
[3326.18 → 3330.02] away, but we all know that's not going to happen. All right, there we go. Here we go. Ladies and
[3330.02 → 3336.02] gentlemen, uh, Robert's back, uh, the Corsair 2080 water block leakage controversy. Any comments?
[3336.02 → 3343.70] I actually made all the comments that I had back when I did my initial coverage of that block when
[3343.70 → 3349.46] they launched it at like CES or Computer or something. And when I did my, uh, my initial
[3349.46 → 3356.42] build with their Hydro X, um, I pointed out the issue to them like a year ago. And as far as I can
[3356.42 → 3363.86] tell, they have actually reinforced it and made it better than it was since then. But, um, yeah, I,
[3364.74 → 3370.50] okay. So I have two comments. One comment is I could see how this could have been a problem in a
[3370.50 → 3377.14] case where a user was not using the product, um, very carefully. And that is something that is
[3377.14 → 3382.50] possible. Like if you've been, uh, even for an experienced user, if you haven't water cooled since
[3382.50 → 3387.22] GPU blocks had the metal of the cold plate, literally come all the way up to where you
[3387.22 → 3391.22] screw in the fittings, like that's how it used to be used to screw into copper or like nickel
[3391.22 → 3395.70] plated copper on the backside. So you could like really like wrench your tubing on there. If you
[3395.70 → 3400.82] had a tight fit, like I used to do three eighths inch tubing over half inch fittings so that the
[3400.82 → 3406.02] inner diameter of the tubing would basically go like straight into the inner diameter of the, uh,
[3406.02 → 3411.62] of the fitting with like no seam even basically, because it was so tight. Um, there's no way you'd
[3411.62 → 3416.66] be able to get that on with Corsair solution without like cracking it or like breaking it or
[3416.66 → 3421.46] something. And I'm not saying that Corsair's thing is, is too weak and it's terrible. I'm just saying
[3421.46 → 3426.42] that, you know, you can't really like abuse them like that anymore. As long as you're careful and you,
[3426.42 → 3431.22] and you brace it from the other side, and you push it on, and you lay out your loop correctly so
[3431.22 → 3435.62] there's not too much strain on it. There's no reason that even that older one should leak. In
[3435.62 → 3442.66] fact, I am still using that launch Hydro-X water block in my system. I switched from soft tubing to
[3442.66 → 3447.46] hard line tubing and I had no leaks. You guys saw in that six hour live stream, my system's working
[3447.46 → 3453.06] just fine. So I see both sides. I see how it could be a problem if you weren't careful, but I also see
[3453.06 → 3460.82] how Corsair says that, well, this is a perfectly good product and it's fine. Um, that's, that's kind of
[3460.82 → 3465.22] my take on it. So I did point out that I saw the potential for problems, but I have not had
[3465.22 → 3472.66] personally any issues with it. Um, no, I don't think I mentioned how flimsy it was in a video
[3472.66 → 3477.86] last week. Oh, did I, did I actually mention it in the six-hour stream? I might've, I might've actually
[3477.86 → 3481.30] mentioned that. Yeah, no. So this is something I've been aware of for a long time. I didn't know that it
[3481.30 → 3486.02] was, uh, blown up until I saw Jay's video show up in my thing. And I was like, sorry, what is this?
[3486.02 → 3492.74] Uh, all right. Who else we got? Uh, decoy for fun says there's a cursor on Luke's head. There is not.
[3494.02 → 3497.30] Yeah. I think for a pretty significant amount of the show, I don't know what you're talking about.
[3499.46 → 3506.02] What cursor on his head? Remember? Cause, uh, Oh, I see. I see.
[3506.02 → 3515.06] Is there any more fun ways that I can.
[3519.38 → 3524.50] Sorry about that guys. It's cause the, uh, it's cause the video chat is behind my window that has
[3524.50 → 3530.90] my browser that I'm using to check the doc. Uh, what else we got here? Decoy for fun says I make
[3530.90 → 3535.86] poor financial decisions. You sure do. Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[3539.78 → 3544.18] Uh, lucky Falcon says with so many HDR monitors, where would you suggest that someone start
[3544.18 → 3548.02] researching trying to find a mid-range full array HDR for games like Tomb Raider? Well,
[3548.02 → 3552.26] you're not going to get full array local dimming on a mid-range monitor. I'll tell you that much.
[3552.26 → 3558.98] So you can, that's a good start to your research. Um, for me, if I was going to spend the extra for the
[3558.98 → 3565.38] HDR experience, I don't know that I would bother until I'm going all the way to HDR 1000 certification,
[3565.38 → 3570.90] just get the VESA HDR 1000 certification. It's not mid-range. And if you can't afford that right now,
[3570.90 → 3579.86] wait, just wait, because HDR 600, 400, they're not as good. And a good quality SDR monitor is still a
[3579.86 → 3585.78] great gaming experience. So just hold off. There's no shame in just waiting until, you know,
[3585.78 → 3590.50] because at some point it'll happen, right? Your savings and the declining price of technology
[3590.50 → 3599.30] will intersect. And that's when you buy, right? Uh, Tom again says, will you tell us now about
[3599.30 → 3604.74] the cable that you use to connect your desk to your rig? No. Although I did see, I think either
[3604.74 → 3610.50] from you or someone else, I did see a comment about this recently. Um, and I sent a follow-up to the
[3610.50 → 3617.46] people who can tell me I'm allowed to tell you about it to ask when I can tell you. Sweet. Uh,
[3617.46 → 3622.42] England says first time watching a WAN show. How's your day going? Not too bad. Not too shabby. Not
[3622.42 → 3627.38] too shabby. Today was good. Yesterday and Wednesday, kind of frustrating for very rough days, but today was
[3627.38 → 3633.78] good. Thomas Foster says, I bet you don't have anyone there that can do cobalt coding. No, I don't think we
[3633.78 → 3638.90] do. You said yesterday, Wednesday was something, whatever frustrating thing. You want to hear something
[3638.90 → 3645.38] frustrating that happens. Sure. Hit me. Can I find this? Here it is. Okay. I was trying to work on
[3645.38 → 3652.34] something in PayPal. Oh, yeah. And I load up the page, right? I log in with my login. Everything's
[3652.34 → 3659.86] working great. I load up the page. It says feature not available in bold text. And then below that it
[3659.86 → 3667.06] says, sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience. That to me sounds
[3667.06 → 3673.30] like something's just down. Right? Right. Check back later. Right? Like that's not, that's not okay.
[3673.30 → 3680.02] So I checked back later. Yeah. Same message. So now I'm like, well, what the heck? Yvonne figures out
[3680.02 → 3685.78] maybe it's just not like a permission that's enabled on that account. You have to be kidding me.
[3685.78 → 3693.46] She nailed it immediately. How is that the message that you send when it's not a feature that you're
[3693.46 → 3700.02] allowed to access? This feature is not, is currently unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience.
[3700.02 → 3707.78] What? Bad error messages are the worst and there's just no excuse for it. Like, why is it that when
[3707.78 → 3714.02] Windows spits out an error message, it's like some coded number series, like, like combination of numbers
[3714.02 → 3718.66] and letters. When you look it up, when you go Google it, and it's just like, here it is in plain,
[3718.66 → 3724.66] simple English. Well, why didn't you just put that there then? How hard is that?
[3724.66 → 3727.22] I can understand some things. It's infuriating.
[3727.22 → 3733.22] When like your, your, your catches it, like it catches something incorrectly or whatever. Because it's,
[3733.22 → 3736.50] you're not properly testing for every blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But this is like,
[3737.54 → 3741.06] the account didn't have permission. That's like the most straightforward thing. Yeah.
[3741.94 → 3746.10] There's, there's no misinterpreting that. That's not some like crazy weird error that it didn't
[3746.10 → 3752.66] catch properly. Unreal. Oh my God. So annoying. Oh, yeah. I never ended up talking about all the
[3752.66 → 3758.82] stupid, uh, drama around the SSD thing. Did I talk about that on the live show? Nope. Oh, okay.
[3762.10 → 3767.94] In other super chats, uh, HR Penguin says, do you think Intel will ditch the i-series branding if and
[3767.94 → 3773.86] when they have a new AMD killer architecture? I actually do. I think that it's time for a rebranding and
[3773.86 → 3779.78] the fact that they're sticking with this goofy 10, 900 K nonsense means that maybe they just
[3780.50 → 3786.10] don't want to rebrand now and have the new branding associated with this 14 nanometre plus,
[3786.10 → 3790.66] plus, plus, plus, plus, plus nonsense. Because we saw the same thing when they released their last AMD
[3790.66 → 3796.34] killer, the core, uh, core two duos. Um, when they launched Conroe, it was, it was a new brand,
[3796.34 → 3802.26] a new Intel. They relegated Pentium to the, the sort of the, the very, very low end where it actually
[3802.26 → 3809.46] still exists. And, uh, I think there, the time is right. Time's right. It's been 14 years or whatever
[3809.46 → 3818.82] since Conroe. Uh, what else we got? Uh, Darren says, hi, Linus. Love what you do. Keep it up.
[3819.94 → 3824.82] Thank you very much. Also shave the beard. Okay. Well, you're going to have an opportunity to vote
[3824.82 → 3831.46] with your wallet on that because we have some shirts coming and whichever design sells the most
[3831.46 → 3838.10] shirts is going to dictate my facial hair for the rest of the year. Wow. Yep. So there's going to be
[3838.10 → 3842.90] a bearded. I'm at the point now where I can kind of announce this. You know what? I have samples.
[3842.90 → 3845.22] Do you want to do a couple or wait, do you even have the super chats open?
[3845.22 → 3852.02] No, I don't think I can. Oh, bloody hell. Okay. Uh, uh, whatever. I'll, I'll, maybe I'll go get it
[3852.02 → 3858.18] later. I might forget. Uh, Alana says received our refund from LTX. RIP decided to give it back
[3858.18 → 3862.18] buying from LTT store.com and donating the rest here. Keep making the amazing content. See you at
[3862.18 → 3869.70] LTX 2021. I will see you there, Alana. Oh, man. I am so bummed about that. Like that sucks.
[3870.58 → 3875.06] Yep. I, I actually love LTX. It's exhausting. Like it's the
[3875.06 → 3882.58] most tiring two days of my year by far, like far and away exhausting. Like it's hard to be
[3882.58 → 3887.62] on like that. And it's like physically draining as well, because I'll go and do things like get in
[3887.62 → 3894.18] like, uh, you know, like battles with people on the, the big inflatable, like, you know, bouncy
[3894.18 → 3901.86] castle thing and stuff like it's exhausting, but it's so much fun. Yeah. I don't know. Um, yeah,
[3901.86 → 3908.18] no, I, I agree. I, I'm sure your, your LTX experience is much more draining than mine.
[3908.18 → 3915.22] You have obviously far more going on. Uh, but when I did that, and then that was on, uh, at the
[3915.22 → 3920.26] beginning of the whole week of all the people from flow plane being there, that was one, that was one
[3920.26 → 3930.58] heck of a sleep. Everybody leaves and I just crashed hard. Uh, David Flesher says loved the
[3930.58 → 3934.74] OLED video more science than usual. Have you thought of doing educational videos about the
[3934.74 → 3938.90] science behind some tech by interviewing industry pros? Yeah. I mean, that was something that, uh,
[3938.90 → 3943.14] James pushed through. He really wanted to do that. And I thought it was really cool. I thought the way
[3943.14 → 3947.46] that it was executed was outstanding. I sent out a little memo to everyone, just like CEO things,
[3947.46 → 3950.82] right? Like, Hey, you just want to say, you know, great job. It all came together so well.
[3950.82 → 3954.82] You know, I feel like such a nerd sometimes, but, uh, yeah, no, I thought it, I thought he did a
[3954.82 → 3961.06] great job. I think there's a ton of, um, opportunity for us to take on more stuff like that.
[3961.06 → 3966.10] Cause the thing is like, honestly, it's when you find the right expert, like there's a handful of
[3966.10 → 3973.46] people that we work with that are just freaking awesome. Um, like there's this one guy from, um,
[3973.46 → 3980.74] um, Oh yeah. His name's Tyler, Tyler from portrait, man. He's just awesome because he's the kind of guy
[3980.74 → 3985.78] where, yeah, he works for like a company whose job it is to sell something or whatever. And I think
[3985.78 → 3991.94] there's an inherent amount of distrust that people have from that, but he is a no BS character. He will
[3991.94 → 3996.90] just give it to us straight. He knows his stuff so well, absolutely love it. Um, and when you find
[3996.90 → 4002.02] people like that, and you just go, yeah, Hey, you know, educate me, you know, brain dump me. Tyler has
[4002.02 → 4007.22] given me more headaches than probably almost any other industry insider that I know, but in a good
[4007.22 → 4012.18] way, just because he dumped too much knowledge into my brain in too short a period of time. He's amazing.
[4012.66 → 4017.38] Um, and so when you find those people, um, you know, there's another guy, Joel, who just knows
[4017.38 → 4022.98] everything about Wi-Fi. Like it's unbelievable. The amount of knowledge he can just drop on you in an
[4022.98 → 4028.58] hour long phone call. Um, it's, it's so easy to get in and do these more science things. And we can focus
[4028.58 → 4034.74] our energy on taking that, that high level stuff, getting the headache, translating it to a way that
[4034.74 → 4039.30] won't give people a headache and then making it flow really well and, and doing our video magic with
[4039.30 → 4049.86] it. That's when honestly Linus media group is at its best. Um, Tom cigar says Garth Brooks,
[4049.86 → 4056.74] please. My family and I need closure. Where did you bury mother? Did you really spend $10 to send me that
[4056.74 → 4065.46] super chat? Like, are you even talking about anything? What are you talking about?
[4065.46 → 4071.78] I have no idea. Is that song lyrics? I mean, it could be. Do you look like
[4075.38 → 4081.06] no, not even remotely? I don't know what's going on here. Um, I didn't know what Garth Brooks looks
[4081.06 → 4087.22] like, but you do not, these are not similar. Wow. Okay. Pink sniper 28 says in a previous
[4087.22 → 4092.98] WAN show, you mentioned that a premium YouTube premium user, uh, compared to an AdSense user
[4092.98 → 4096.82] added more to the bottom line. How does that compare to someone who checks out the link below?
[4096.82 → 4102.26] So usually the link below is to a sponsor, and we're getting like a fixed rate for that, depending. Um,
[4102.26 → 4107.38] some of ours are affiliate based. Some of them are fixed rate based. And as for how it compares,
[4107.38 → 4112.90] it really depends on the rates for, for that particular engagement. Um, I can tell you that,
[4113.62 → 4118.90] um, the only thing that really drives rates up is more people actually engaging with that sponsor.
[4118.90 → 4123.46] So like buying products from them, if they see better ROI, then when we turn around, and we go,
[4123.46 → 4126.90] Hey, by the way, our viewership's double what it was last time we did a rate negotiation.
[4126.90 → 4130.58] You're going to have to pay more. Um, they're more likely to say, uh, okay, yes, we should
[4131.22 → 4134.02] probably stick with you guys versus now. Peace. See ya.
[4134.02 → 4140.18] So it really depends. Alex says this money, my previous super chats, my float plane sub,
[4140.18 → 4144.18] and my occasional YouTube premium watch time. I consider all contributions to the Luke and Linus
[4144.18 → 4150.42] Star Wars, the last Jedi commentary track recording. Oh, do you want to do it?
[4150.42 → 4154.02] I would a hundred percent do that. Do you want to do it? Let's do it.
[4154.58 → 4160.02] We should do all of them. Let's do it. I'm super down. So we just, we just throw on,
[4160.02 → 4165.70] we just throw on the movie. We just throw on a mic. Totally. I think what we would kind of have
[4165.70 → 4170.34] to do, we'd have to have kind of a, uh, a bit of a complicated audio setup for it because I wouldn't
[4170.34 → 4175.70] want the actual movies audio on it because then, you know, copyright issues and all that. So we'd
[4175.70 → 4179.70] have to be wearing headphones. We'd have to have each other's voices piped through the headphones.
[4179.70 → 4183.38] So we're both monitoring on the same as interface. And then we'd have to have the movie
[4183.38 → 4187.38] audio coming through as well. And then our microphones would have to be a clean recording
[4187.38 → 4190.26] feed that doesn't contain it. We both just wear closed back headphones or something.
[4190.26 → 4195.46] We could totally do it. Absolutely. I would love to. I'm into it. Okay. You know what, Alex? Um,
[4196.10 → 4199.86] we'll do it. We'll do it. Here's the commitment. We'll do it. I'm not going to say we're going to
[4199.86 → 4206.58] do it right away. No, I have. Yeah. I don't even have closed back headphones, so we can't do it
[4206.58 → 4211.46] like immediately. Yeah, we got this. Um, what was going to say? Are we doing all of them?
[4211.46 → 4218.74] Man, I don't know if I would have as much to say about all of them.
[4220.58 → 4225.46] I think I, I, I'm down for whatever. I definitely have unique comments for each one.
[4225.46 → 4228.74] I'm going to commit to last Jedi. Okay.
[4228.74 → 4232.26] Or last Rise of Skywalker, whatever the stupid last one is called.
[4233.06 → 4236.90] Um, yeah, sorry. The, the, the comment here is last Jedi. That's why I had it on my brain.
[4236.90 → 4240.10] I'm sure you don't mean last Jedi. I'm sure you mean Rise of Skywalker, right?
[4242.58 → 4249.86] Right. I'm sure that's what you mean. Um, oh man, so bad. Anyway, people, I saw a comment sort
[4249.86 → 4255.46] of criticizing me as having all bad takes on Star Wars. It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4256.18 → 4259.94] I mean, there's some, you know, lore things that I'll get wrong or whatever, but
[4259.94 → 4266.82] I'm coming at this might just me. This might just be me wanting to like watch Star Wars and me
[4266.82 → 4271.78] enjoying our, our Star Wars conversations, especially after the last movie. Um, but I
[4271.78 → 4275.94] kind of just want to do all the movies. You know what? Not even the most recent three,
[4275.94 → 4280.34] like all of them. Let's just do it. I'm down. Screw it. Let's do it.
[4280.34 → 4285.46] It sounds really enjoyable. Like I'm totally in, but my critiques are coming at it from a just
[4285.46 → 4293.46] storytelling basics, like storytelling 101 sort of perspective. That's where they get stuff wrong.
[4293.46 → 4300.82] It's bad storytelling. And that whole thing last week when we talked about where, um,
[4300.82 → 4303.94] I forget what his name is, but he basically came out and said, like, who cares what's
[4303.94 → 4309.62] canon? It's all fake anyway. That's a bad attitude that turns into bad storytelling. That's all. That's
[4309.62 → 4315.30] all there is to it. That's an attitude that I think a decent amount of the audience has sheltered
[4315.30 → 4322.34] themselves in, including myself to like be more okay with still being fans. That's not an approach
[4322.34 → 4329.94] that you want the creators behind it to be taken. Of course not. Promoting. Yeah. Uh, shadow 83XX1,
[4329.94 → 4335.86] Linus looking to upgrade my seven-year-old PC end of this year or sometime next year. Any news on 10
[4335.86 → 4345.38] nanometre Intel or RTX 3000 series, man? I wouldn't wait for 10 nanometre Intel at this point.
[4347.38 → 4352.18] I'm not saying it's not coming. I don't know when it's coming. I'm just saying, I just,
[4352.18 → 4356.18] you know, it's one of those, uh, don't hold your breath things, you know? Um,
[4356.18 → 4365.46] uh, as for RTX 3000 series, I mean, Nvidia just launched an Ampere or just announced an Ampere
[4365.46 → 4371.70] architecture, uh, data centre GPU. I would, I would hazard a guess that the desktop stuff might not be
[4371.70 → 4376.66] that far behind. And I'd say that would be a pretty sick time to, to upgrade. It's a great time to be a
[4376.66 → 4383.78] PC gamer right now, honestly. Uh, one last super chat SSJ4Evo something, something. Thanks for the
[4383.78 → 4388.74] LTX refund. Last year, I was the next person in line to see you when you walked away. I'm sorry.
[4388.74 → 4394.18] I'm sorry. I really just like had to go places. Sometimes I really do my best. Um, I will see
[4394.18 → 4398.90] you next year. I'll see you next year. All right. Assuming that, you know, new normal allows us to
[4398.90 → 4403.38] even have conventions. Like man, hearing new normal freaks me out a little bit.
[4403.38 → 4410.42] Yeah. Did you ever watch mystery science theatre? I'm totally, I'm still stuck on this. Because I'm
[4410.42 → 4414.66] actually pretty excited. You ever watched mystery science theatre 3000? I didn't. I'm sorry. Furthermore, I
[4414.66 → 4422.98] didn't. Oh, they, they would watch like these old, like terrible, but great movies. Yeah. And they
[4422.98 → 4428.42] would comment on them. Uh, I haven't watched it in forever, but I, I like, it feels like we're
[4428.42 → 4433.30] doing like mystery tech theatre. Yeah. 3000. I'm down. I'm down. It'll have to
[4433.30 → 4437.38] be, it'll have to be like float plane exclusive. So guys, make sure you're on float plane also just
[4437.38 → 4441.22] to, you know, make sure the float plane team has more food to eat and all that good stuff.
[4442.02 → 4445.22] Gotta go subscribe on float plane, not just Linus tech tips. I don't even, I don't care about that.
[4445.94 → 4449.38] There's a bunch of great stuff. Do you have any float plane news that you want to talk about?
[4449.38 → 4452.66] It's sort of after party now shows over no more super chats.
[4452.66 → 4457.94] The, uh, what, what, what we're internally calling the blog posts feature, which is, might be a little
[4457.94 → 4465.86] dated for, for public naming blogging. Um, Oh my, uh, which essentially means being able to post,
[4465.86 → 4471.94] uh, multiple forms of content, not just video, being able to post pictures and, and audio and,
[4471.94 → 4478.58] and whatnot. Uh, that is coming a little bit faster maybe than we had hoped, but I have no date for
[4478.58 → 4484.42] anyone because, uh, you learned your lesson there. Yes, I did. It's coming to pre pot prodding
[4484.42 → 4488.82] a little bit faster than we had maybe originally expected. That's all the news I have for it,
[4488.82 → 4493.46] but that's going to be a very exciting update. Cool. So yeah. All right. Are there going to be
[4493.46 → 4498.90] any new creators for us to announce soon? Uh, once the blog post feature comes in,
[4499.62 → 4505.86] I suspect so. Yes. Okay, cool. All right. So thanks much for tuning in this week.
[4505.86 → 4510.18] Hope you guys enjoyed the show. We'll see you again next week. Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4510.18 → 4516.74] No, hopefully not the same time. Hopefully earlier. Oops. I need to get some dinner.
[4516.74 → 4520.02] Oh, I'm so hungry, dude. Me too. Oh.
[4523.06 → 4527.78] I just need to eat. I don't even know if there's any food at my house though. My wife's not here.
[4527.78 → 4532.02] So that's usually a solid indicator that there is no food at my house.
[4532.98 → 4538.18] Or at least not like food that's ready to be eaten. Right. Yeah. All right. I'm ending the YouTube.
