[0.72 → 17.80] And welcome to The WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen, the show where usually we talk about tech, and often we talk about our own personal lives, and occasionally we run our mouths and dig a really, really deep hole for ourselves.
[17.96 → 27.56] And yes, Luke, I did include you in there. I said we, even though you actually didn't say anything, which was a very, very good decision that you made at that time.
[27.56 → 31.20] I actually, I tried to pull you back multiple times.
[31.28 → 39.26] Yeah, you did. You actually did. And that was one of the things that made it all the more painful to go back and rewatch that segment of the show.
[39.96 → 44.56] Next time, if you could just, because I'm pretty sure, the thing about, okay, so here's the thing.
[44.96 → 51.90] When you hire people who you know have kind of like a sketchy, a sketchy past, okay?
[52.30 → 57.28] You know, when you, when you know, look, I'm not saying, okay, I'm not saying you have a sketchy past.
[57.28 → 64.98] I'm just saying that you have the kind of knowledge that I might expect from someone who has a bit of a sketchy past.
[65.54 → 65.70] Okay.
[65.84 → 77.68] So when you hire someone like that, you got to assume that they've got some kind of like, you know, you know, kill bot, you know, on your, on your network, you know, because just in case you ever cross them.
[77.72 → 77.92] Right.
[78.38 → 81.64] So next time that happens, this is why I'm dragging you into this.
[81.88 → 85.52] Next time that happens, I, all I ask is you just deploy it.
[85.52 → 86.44] Just shut it down.
[86.46 → 87.88] Just shut her down.
[88.28 → 91.54] You know, make, make me think there are technical difficulties.
[92.20 → 95.44] I love how the solution is not convinced you that you're wrong.
[95.58 → 95.96] No, no.
[95.96 → 97.70] The solution is shut it down.
[97.70 → 101.38] No, no, you can, no, you can convince me I'm wrong, but just do that later.
[101.70 → 104.92] You know, you have to hit, you have to hit the emergency button.
[105.26 → 107.40] You know, it's, there's no time, Luke.
[107.40 → 108.70] Luke, there's no time.
[109.70 → 111.98] I should have been, I should have been more sure.
[112.18 → 113.44] I watched it back too.
[113.88 → 118.98] And I think, yeah, because there was, there are quite a few times when I was like, I don't know.
[119.08 → 121.16] Maybe he knows something that I don't know.
[121.24 → 123.80] He didn't, he didn't know anything, Luke.
[124.34 → 124.78] Nothing.
[124.78 → 129.48] You can see it in my face where I'm like, really?
[129.94 → 131.22] I don't, I'm not sure.
[132.42 → 133.36] No, no, no.
[133.42 → 134.32] He knew nothing, Luke.
[134.40 → 135.00] He knew nothing.
[135.08 → 137.20] And you should have, you should have trusted your instincts.
[137.94 → 138.14] Okay.
[138.18 → 139.56] The problem with I knew little.
[139.72 → 142.16] They've got, they've got stink in there, but they don't stink.
[142.32 → 145.88] They're like, they're in, like they stank.
[145.92 → 148.06] Maybe they stunk before, but now they're good.
[148.70 → 150.56] You know, you have to, you have to trust them.
[150.56 → 153.34] We've got a great show for you guys today.
[156.64 → 162.08] Apple has been locking the phones that have been stolen.
[163.68 → 168.70] NCI US is apparently, the website is back online.
[169.48 → 170.04] What do you get?
[170.22 → 170.68] That's right.
[170.80 → 171.22] That's right.
[171.38 → 172.40] You go ahead.
[172.44 → 173.32] You say it.
[173.42 → 174.98] No, you have to say it now.
[176.24 → 178.12] Just, he's so excited about these guys.
[178.82 → 179.14] Wait for it.
[179.14 → 184.58] AMD implies RDNA 2 Big Nazi will release for PC before next-gen consoles.
[184.98 → 186.68] Calls it a Halo product.
[187.28 → 188.72] And Leon 10 nanometre.
[188.72 → 189.50] Wait, wait, wait.
[189.66 → 193.16] Does that mean it's, that, that means it, does that mean it's a buggy rehash of something
[193.16 → 194.60] they did 10 years ago?
[195.24 → 195.98] Got him!
[196.62 → 197.10] Oof.
[198.14 → 198.58] Oof.
[198.70 → 201.72] Calling something a Halo product when it's for PC and not console.
[201.90 → 202.30] Hooray.
[202.78 → 203.70] Got him, got him.
[203.70 → 204.68] Leon 10 nanometre.
[204.68 → 209.52] Intel 10 nanometre 24 core processor found on Geek bench.
[209.92 → 211.76] Found on Geek bench.
[212.10 → 215.12] More, more, more, we already have good stream thumbs up in the chat.
[215.22 → 215.86] I appreciate it.
[215.94 → 216.12] Yeah.
[216.16 → 217.02] Thank you, guys.
[217.98 → 219.24] Appreciate you guys too.
[219.32 → 220.06] Good, good comment.
[220.82 → 221.70] Good comment.
[222.14 → 223.14] Good comment.
[223.14 → 230.56] The first video you guys uploaded on Float plane after that Sancho, the whole comment section.
[230.64 → 231.56] It was unreadable.
[231.70 → 232.42] It was unreadable.
[232.62 → 232.86] All right.
[232.94 → 234.18] Let's roll that intro.
[234.40 → 235.58] Roll that intro, ladies and gentlemen.
[235.58 → 236.58] Oh.
[246.04 → 247.42] Also, you want to know a big rip?
[247.96 → 248.34] Oh, yeah?
[249.02 → 253.14] The LTX 20 emotes are still on Float plane.
[253.60 → 254.00] Oh.
[254.80 → 256.64] I am so sad.
[256.74 → 261.14] I was like tweeting back and forth with, um, who was it?
[261.18 → 262.06] I think it was the EPOS.
[262.72 → 265.30] Uh, I don't, I don't have the thing, so I'll just put it like that.
[265.30 → 270.02] I was tweeting back and forth with EPOS, uh, on, on, I guess, Twitter, I guess.
[270.08 → 270.96] That's where you tweet things.
[272.30 → 273.64] It's been a long week, okay?
[273.88 → 278.48] Uh, so I was tweeting with him and like, oh, yeah, and I was texting with, uh, Steve from
[278.48 → 283.34] Gamers Nexus and like both of them just made me think of like LTX.
[283.34 → 287.62] Steve like specifically brought it up, and I'm like, it hurts.
[287.82 → 292.66] Like, I am so bummed that we're not doing LTX this year.
[292.66 → 298.96] Obviously, it was the right call and I should have made it earlier, but I, I just had so
[298.96 → 300.54] much fun last year.
[300.66 → 305.96] And now that it's a year later, I honestly feel like it was more fun even than I felt
[305.96 → 306.82] like it was then.
[306.88 → 311.36] Like, you know how memories can make something seem sweeter than it was even?
[311.64 → 314.58] Like whether it was bad or whether it was good in the first place.
[314.58 → 317.24] Memories kind of can make it better.
[319.54 → 322.02] Or worse, but like, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.
[324.88 → 327.62] You'll usually kind of shave off one side or the other.
[327.92 → 328.10] Yeah.
[328.14 → 332.76] But I just, I had, I had such a good time last year, and I was, I went back, um, not that
[332.76 → 337.30] long ago because I forget what it was for, but I was watching some of the collab videos
[337.30 → 338.14] that people had released.
[338.14 → 344.16] Like even ones that I wasn't in or anything, um, from LTX last year and just like being
[344.16 → 345.70] like, wow, that was so cool.
[345.72 → 351.98] Just having probably more of the tech community all together in one place than anything other
[351.98 → 356.08] than probably CES would be the only one I can think of where there'd be more.
[356.48 → 362.16] Computer is probably close, but, um, it's overseas for a lot of the North American guys.
[362.22 → 365.58] So at least within our circle, it's not as commonly travelled to.
[365.58 → 370.20] And especially in recent times, because so many creators have stopped attending shows.
[370.72 → 371.12] Yeah.
[371.52 → 372.38] Oh yeah, for sure.
[372.52 → 377.38] You're getting more of those creators that have stopped attending shows that are, well,
[377.64 → 378.94] going to in the future, probably.
[379.16 → 381.88] And also for 2019 attended LTX.
[382.16 → 382.32] Yeah.
[382.32 → 382.64] Which is pretty sweet.
[382.94 → 387.42] There's still a lot of people who didn't come this year are like still supportive of 2021.
[387.62 → 389.20] They're like, yeah, you know, give me a year.
[389.20 → 395.18] And, you know, as long as we've got, uh, as long as we've got that, that, uh, that COVID
[395.18 → 396.94] vaccine sorted out and all that good stuff.
[396.96 → 399.10] And as long as it's like safe to travel, I'm, I'm super down.
[399.32 → 403.44] Do you see a Marquez's tweet about CES's announcement that they're going forward with
[403.44 → 404.26] an in-person event?
[405.56 → 406.26] They are.
[406.58 → 407.34] I know.
[407.34 → 407.68] Right.
[407.76 → 412.10] I don't know if they've backtracked on this since then, but I can head over to the CES
[412.10 → 414.94] website, CES, the global stage for innovation.
[418.64 → 423.56] Um, what is this?
[425.28 → 426.82] Um, oh, okay.
[426.90 → 427.70] Well, that's confusing.
[428.10 → 428.78] Uh, okay.
[428.78 → 430.40] Let's go ahead and have a look.
[430.46 → 430.60] Yeah.
[430.64 → 431.40] CES 2020.
[431.88 → 432.10] Yeah.
[432.18 → 432.40] Go ahead.
[432.40 → 436.50] There's theory that CES was the vector into the U S in the first place.
[438.74 → 439.18] Really?
[439.24 → 440.70] Like there's some fairly legitimate.
[440.70 → 442.38] That long ago?
[443.64 → 444.08] Yeah.
[444.32 → 445.66] Because they don't really know when it started.
[447.28 → 451.96] I imagine if it had been CES, it would have gotten a lot bigger, a lot faster though.
[452.66 → 454.72] Everybody gets sick at CES.
[455.48 → 455.92] Yeah.
[456.66 → 457.08] Yeah.
[457.12 → 459.74] Hotels, registration information, conference, exhibitors.
[459.74 → 462.58] I've seen posts about it, but the timeline is a little messed, isn't it?
[462.82 → 464.76] CES is the largest tech show on the planet.
[464.92 → 465.04] Huh?
[465.16 → 465.32] Yeah.
[465.42 → 465.70] Yep.
[465.74 → 465.98] Yep.
[466.12 → 469.94] No, I, uh, yeah, I, I'm not going to be there.
[469.94 → 471.50] I'll tell you that much right now.
[472.10 → 479.72] Um, and, uh, unless there are people on my, on my team that really want to go, then no,
[479.78 → 482.96] I'm not going to be sending anyone over there.
[483.06 → 485.84] It's just not what's, what's the point.
[485.84 → 491.10] I mean, that's something that honestly, I feel like I've, I knew already, like I already got
[491.10 → 495.42] kind of irritated when brands would want to, you know, fly everyone in their dog who has
[495.42 → 500.30] a very busy schedule to some place so that they can put you up in a hotel that I just
[500.30 → 500.66] look around.
[500.74 → 502.42] I go like, all I'm doing is sleeping here.
[502.50 → 503.68] Like this costs too much.
[503.78 → 505.10] It doesn't make any sense.
[505.22 → 509.58] Why are we all here when you could have just given me a briefing over Skype and sent me a
[509.58 → 509.90] device?
[509.90 → 512.18] Cause that's all I actually care about.
[512.26 → 516.12] I just want to know about the product and I need my hands on the product so that I can
[516.12 → 519.08] see if I agree with what you're telling me about the product.
[519.18 → 519.82] That's, that's it.
[520.40 → 525.96] And so this whole, this whole song and dance of like dinners and events and stuff like that.
[526.44 → 532.68] Um, it's never made a ton of sense to the pragmatic side of me.
[532.68 → 537.54] Like, obviously it's nice to, it's nice to, you know, see people in the industry that I
[537.54 → 539.20] don't otherwise get a chance to see.
[539.32 → 540.90] Like that's, that's one good thing about it.
[540.96 → 544.62] But from like a brand standpoint, I don't really understand what the value is for them.
[545.06 → 549.46] So it's really made me, even though it was something I was already aware of, it's really
[549.46 → 553.32] made me rethink just how necessary any of this is.
[556.00 → 556.40] Yeah.
[556.40 → 564.30] Um, just to, just to jump back on it, I, I found the investigations into COVID being
[564.30 → 567.06] at CES, and apparently it was a thing.
[567.62 → 567.98] Really?
[568.62 → 569.10] Yeah.
[569.76 → 570.28] Um.
[570.64 → 571.16] Fascinating.
[571.86 → 572.90] Kind of interesting.
[573.04 → 577.40] One of the earliest vectors into the U S, and they're going forward.
[578.00 → 578.56] Yeah.
[579.04 → 579.54] All right.
[579.56 → 580.18] Well, good luck.
[580.28 → 580.62] Good luck.
[580.62 → 584.58] Ladies and gentlemen, why don't we jump into what was our first headline topic for the day?
[584.58 → 587.84] This was originally posted on patently Apple.
[588.70 → 597.08] Apple has apparently been sending messenger messages to, uh, people who have stolen phones
[597.08 → 598.74] from their Apple stores.
[599.30 → 608.48] So, I mean, Apple is kind of an obvious target for any kind of, uh, you know, uh, looting behaviours
[608.48 → 613.94] because their products, well, yeah, they're, they're high value and not just high value.
[613.94 → 618.26] One of the one of the coolest things about an Apple product, if you can think about it
[618.26 → 621.94] is that it holds its value incredibly well.
[622.80 → 627.88] Like a great condition iPhone is worth maybe like that, but that's not sealed and brand
[627.88 → 632.16] new is worth maybe like a few percent less than a brand new sealed iPhone.
[632.44 → 634.74] Uh, maybe 5%, maybe 10.
[634.88 → 639.00] Whereas if you buy like a game controller, okay, you go buy an Xbox controller, and you go try
[639.00 → 641.48] to flip that on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace or whatever.
[642.00 → 645.20] I guarantee you, you're taking a 25% hit at least.
[646.12 → 647.96] Even if it's like perfect condition.
[648.62 → 649.32] So, yeah.
[649.42 → 653.90] Uh, the one, one thing to point out here is that it's not clear whether this was
[653.90 → 654.90] all the devices.
[655.06 → 657.22] It might've just been the demo devices.
[657.22 → 661.74] Um, and demo devices do tend to run special software.
[661.74 → 663.62] So it's not clear.
[663.70 → 668.58] It's, it's probably unlikely that like your random iPhone that you have at home has this
[668.58 → 669.58] type of kill switch in it.
[669.96 → 674.38] Um, it's, it's probably just the demo phones, but, but still pretty interesting.
[675.06 → 678.88] Several locations, including Apple stores in Minneapolis, Portland, and Phoenix were reported
[678.88 → 679.80] to have been looted.
[679.96 → 682.28] And in response, Apple has temporarily closed some of those stores.
[682.28 → 685.10] And there's a photo shared on Twitter.
[685.20 → 690.22] You guys can check it out there that shows what is reported to be a stolen iPhone displaying
[690.22 → 691.36] this warning message.
[692.10 → 694.40] Please return to Apple Walnut Street.
[695.44 → 698.68] This device has been disabled and is being tracked.
[699.28 → 701.12] Local authorities will be alerted.
[702.10 → 702.46] Oops.
[703.74 → 704.38] Yikes.
[704.76 → 708.24] So the lesson here is very simple.
[708.24 → 713.78] You know, I'm not going to get philosophical about, you know, stealing iPhones or, or whatever,
[714.02 → 716.56] but I will leave you guys with this.
[716.72 → 722.50] If you're going to steal something, you should steal something without a GPS in it.
[725.60 → 726.08] Okay.
[726.38 → 727.04] That's it.
[727.56 → 728.20] That's all.
[728.46 → 733.22] I think that's a universally applicable lesson that we can all appreciate.
[734.52 → 736.58] I did not think that was going there.
[736.58 → 737.42] Not at all.
[738.24 → 745.14] Not going to, not going to, not going to get into the whole, you know, this is, we ended
[745.14 → 745.98] up with a car.
[746.32 → 748.12] No, we ended up with a lot of GPS.
[749.48 → 751.44] We ended up with a lot of controversy.
[751.44 → 751.92] Okay.
[751.92 → 756.34] When we had that discussion about like a movie and music piracy a little while ago.
[756.40 → 760.46] So I'm not even going to get into, you know, stealing good, stealing bad.
[760.58 → 762.42] I'm just going to give you a free tech tip.
[762.52 → 762.86] Okay.
[762.86 → 764.92] Don't steal stuff with a GPS in it.
[764.92 → 771.68] And especially stuff with a GPS in it that has a serial number that is hardware linked
[771.68 → 772.40] to the device.
[772.94 → 774.38] That's terrible.
[774.90 → 775.98] Extra terrible.
[775.98 → 777.90] So, um, yep.
[778.30 → 779.54] Good, good, good job.
[779.80 → 781.58] Like take pictures of you while you hold it.
[781.84 → 781.96] Yeah.
[781.96 → 782.16] Yeah.
[782.28 → 782.44] Yeah.
[783.16 → 783.56] Yeah.
[783.56 → 784.06] That's bonus.
[784.58 → 785.04] That's a bonus.
[785.26 → 785.72] It also doesn't help.
[786.06 → 786.24] Yeah.
[786.28 → 787.36] That's bonus fail.
[787.98 → 791.74] Um, Apple hasn't made any kind of comment.
[791.74 → 797.80] So we actually don't know, um, for sure, you know, what the mechanism is of this kill
[797.80 → 799.38] switch or whatever the case may be.
[799.54 → 804.36] But, um, we do know for sure that they want that particular iPhone returned to Apple Walnut
[804.36 → 804.72] street.
[805.06 → 805.36] Yeah.
[805.44 → 807.36] And that also that it is being tracked.
[807.74 → 811.96] So tell me this, Luke, you're the person holding this phone.
[812.48 → 812.96] Okay.
[813.68 → 814.12] Nice.
[814.34 → 815.28] What's your next step?
[816.02 → 818.70] Don't put your, don't put yourself in their mindset.
[819.34 → 820.02] You're Luke.
[820.88 → 822.08] You're Luke Cafetière.
[822.70 → 824.90] Or wait, I guess you got to put yourself in their mindset a little bit.
[824.90 → 825.18] Okay.
[825.18 → 826.30] So you stole a phone.
[827.42 → 828.34] Well, let's say took a phone.
[828.44 → 828.72] Okay.
[828.76 → 829.90] I'm not even going to go that far.
[830.06 → 831.12] You took a phone.
[831.86 → 832.04] Okay.
[832.04 → 835.94] Maybe you thought someone needed it back or whatever, you know, you, whatever you're holding
[835.94 → 836.14] it.
[836.34 → 837.48] You get this message.
[838.82 → 839.60] What do you do?
[840.52 → 846.40] Uh, well, I mean, if we're going under the context that I stole it, um, I'm going to do
[846.40 → 847.02] the action.
[847.02 → 847.16] You took it.
[847.16 → 847.64] You took it.
[848.42 → 849.40] I took it.
[850.80 → 851.84] From the Apple Store.
[853.16 → 854.68] I'm just not using the word stole.
[854.68 → 855.32] You took it.
[856.84 → 857.16] Okay.
[857.42 → 857.68] Okay.
[857.80 → 859.24] I mean, the door wasn't locked anyway.
[860.04 → 861.66] I would, I would yeet.
[862.28 → 862.90] You would yeet.
[863.08 → 864.74] You would, you would, you would toss it.
[864.80 → 865.46] You'd get rid of it.
[865.72 → 866.00] Yeah.
[866.22 → 866.54] Yeah.
[866.70 → 866.88] Okay.
[866.90 → 867.20] I don't know.
[867.40 → 871.90] I think especially right now, I, it would be, it would be something to get rid of.
[871.98 → 872.72] So here's a question.
[872.92 → 874.80] Are you making your life more difficult?
[875.08 → 876.42] It's now destruction of property.
[876.50 → 876.68] Yeah.
[876.72 → 878.06] Because they've been tracking you.
[878.70 → 880.64] They've probably sent pictures back.
[881.16 → 881.56] Okay.
[881.72 → 884.04] Are you actually, so, so that's.
[884.04 → 884.26] Yeah.
[884.34 → 886.02] No, we're talking tech tips here.
[886.32 → 888.92] We're sticking to tech tips, tech tips.
[889.06 → 890.16] Now I'm, what do you do?
[890.16 → 895.38] I'm now recovering my, my, the phone that I vote.
[895.98 → 897.12] Um, yeah.
[897.32 → 898.18] That you vote.
[898.18 → 899.74] Is that the past tense of yeet?
[899.74 → 901.18] I don't know.
[901.34 → 902.40] Because I could get into that.
[903.02 → 903.80] I like it.
[903.86 → 904.82] I think I support this.
[906.10 → 908.46] And then, yeah, I think I'd take it back to the store, I guess.
[908.54 → 908.98] I don't know.
[909.80 → 910.34] I lost.
[910.52 → 910.96] Do you take it?
[910.96 → 911.86] I'd be like, oh, wow.
[911.86 → 915.42] I bought this from a person.
[915.64 → 915.86] Okay.
[915.88 → 916.62] But the store is closed.
[916.62 → 917.00] On the Craigslist.
[917.16 → 918.38] The store is presumably closed.
[920.68 → 922.38] Leave it on the smashed counter.
[922.48 → 923.66] Just leave it on the smashed counter.
[923.88 → 924.38] Here you go.
[924.48 → 924.64] Yeah.
[924.68 → 925.22] I don't know.
[925.42 → 927.72] It's a weird, because they're closing all the other stores.
[927.96 → 930.66] This store is probably looted and destroyed anyway.
[931.16 → 932.84] So yeah, I really don't know like what.
[934.18 → 934.58] Yeah.
[934.58 → 937.54] Leave it in the broken store and someone else will take it, I guess.
[937.62 → 939.00] That's, that's my move for sure.
[939.64 → 940.22] A hundred percent.
[940.48 → 949.40] Cause like, I actually don't know what the legal ramifications of taking something, taking
[949.40 → 949.66] it.
[949.74 → 950.02] Okay.
[950.38 → 954.14] And then putting it back, bringing it back before you're ever actually charged.
[955.76 → 958.96] I think, I think you still get charged.
[959.18 → 959.42] Okay.
[959.48 → 961.12] But like, well, like, I mean, well, okay.
[961.14 → 963.62] So forget from a legal standpoint then from a moral standpoint.
[963.62 → 963.98] Okay.
[963.98 → 964.94] I have no idea.
[965.12 → 971.10] So I, I'm like real mad at my neighbour because they put their, they dumped their lawn clippings
[971.10 → 973.98] over my fence for the last time.
[974.16 → 974.48] Okay.
[974.60 → 980.20] So I'm, I'm mad at my neighbour and I go and I take a bat and I like smash his passenger
[980.20 → 981.62] side window in his car.
[981.78 → 982.26] Okay.
[982.52 → 985.12] Because I'm, I'm, I'm an angry person like that.
[985.78 → 986.26] Okay.
[986.46 → 986.78] Okay.
[987.50 → 990.48] I realize, oh, you know what?
[990.94 → 993.02] That wasn't a nice thing to do because.
[993.02 → 994.02] Yeah.
[994.02 → 995.52] He's out of town for a week.
[995.52 → 995.96] Right.
[996.02 → 996.96] And it's going to rain.
[997.40 → 1000.50] And that's really a lot more damage than I wanted to do.
[1000.80 → 1002.20] So I'm a nice guy.
[1002.30 → 1007.90] I realize, well, this is a simple fix because I conveniently have access to his car because
[1007.90 → 1011.46] I can unlock the door very easily now because there is a broken window.
[1011.46 → 1015.30] I pretend his car is mine.
[1015.68 → 1016.98] I have the window fixed.
[1017.12 → 1019.04] I put it back exactly the way it was.
[1020.56 → 1024.92] Did I'm morally speaking, did I commit a crime?
[1026.18 → 1030.84] Remember, remember when you, when you talked about how we got in a lot of stuff for the
[1030.92 → 1032.24] for the piracy conversation.
[1032.72 → 1034.54] Are we going down that line?
[1034.54 → 1038.04] We're going to have a hypothetical, we're going to have a hypothetical conversation here,
[1038.08 → 1038.26] Luke.
[1038.50 → 1039.36] This is hypothetical.
[1039.62 → 1039.78] Okay.
[1039.80 → 1040.28] Does that help?
[1040.40 → 1042.44] I mean, I think you're still morally wrong.
[1042.94 → 1044.48] You think I'm still morally wrong?
[1045.20 → 1045.38] Yeah.
[1045.44 → 1046.26] I mean, for one.
[1046.40 → 1047.30] What about atonement, Luke?
[1047.30 → 1048.78] You damaged his property.
[1048.98 → 1049.44] I did.
[1049.46 → 1050.16] Sure, you fixed it.
[1050.26 → 1050.44] I did.
[1050.44 → 1052.84] But you also temporarily stole it.
[1053.04 → 1055.28] You presumably drove it around or got it towed.
[1055.28 → 1056.24] I could have had it towed.
[1056.28 → 1057.10] I could have had it towed.
[1057.14 → 1058.06] I would not have driven it.
[1058.06 → 1061.40] If you had it towed, that is some amount of increased wear on the vehicle.
[1062.02 → 1062.68] That's fair.
[1062.80 → 1068.14] And that is use of his property that he does not condone.
[1069.60 → 1074.88] And what's, what's saying that the quality of the new window is up to par with the quality
[1074.88 → 1075.44] of the previous window?
[1075.44 → 1076.44] What if it was better?
[1077.56 → 1079.32] What if I got him like a tinted one?
[1079.32 → 1079.64] You gave him an upgrade?
[1081.04 → 1083.26] It's the one singular tinted window.
[1083.88 → 1084.28] Okay.
[1084.30 → 1084.96] No, forget it.
[1084.98 → 1085.90] It's, it's just better.
[1085.98 → 1087.14] It's like, it smells nice.
[1087.14 → 1088.04] It's better for whatever reason.
[1088.06 → 1088.16] Yeah.
[1088.16 → 1088.92] It smells nice.
[1089.46 → 1091.06] It's a nice smelling window.
[1092.28 → 1092.68] Yeah.
[1092.68 → 1093.60] It's a good fragrance.
[1093.60 → 1094.96] This car will never be stinky again.
[1095.58 → 1100.38] I think that is the way to go about the atonement angle.
[1101.74 → 1103.86] I still don't think it's morally right.
[1104.46 → 1105.38] If they press.
[1105.38 → 1107.74] But I think it's redeeming, if you know what I mean.
[1107.84 → 1108.08] Okay.
[1108.20 → 1110.24] I think, here's how I think it works.
[1110.34 → 1112.94] I think it's still up to them to press charges or not.
[1113.22 → 1113.38] Yeah.
[1113.44 → 1116.80] And then I think ultimately it's going to be a sentencing issue.
[1116.94 → 1121.60] So it, let's say it was a much more severe crime that you then atoned for and like kind
[1121.60 → 1124.56] of wiped the slate back to fresh and no one's the wiser.
[1125.06 → 1126.74] You know, and let's say it headed to a jury.
[1127.24 → 1129.38] I think the jury still has to convict you.
[1129.38 → 1134.54] But then when it's time for sentencing, that's where the leniency comes in, where they say,
[1134.68 → 1138.54] well, you know, normally the sentence for this would be six years in prison or whatever.
[1138.54 → 1144.62] But like, you know, you, the person you killed, you brought them back to life exactly like
[1144.62 → 1145.06] they were.
[1145.20 → 1146.62] So I guess it's fine now.
[1146.62 → 1153.18] If you, if you drove the vehicle away, I think that's like Grand Theft Auto.
[1153.92 → 1154.12] Yeah.
[1155.32 → 1157.00] So it's really not great.
[1157.18 → 1158.44] You're not, you're not doing good here.
[1158.64 → 1158.78] Right.
[1158.78 → 1165.56] I think, I think if I was arbiter of this situation, I think the person who broke the
[1165.56 → 1166.82] window would be morally wrong.
[1167.20 → 1172.44] But if they went and like got it fixed and there was actually an improvement and they
[1172.44 → 1177.68] apologized, I think if you went after them further, you're probably morally wrong.
[1177.68 → 1178.50] Oh, I'd say nothing.
[1179.04 → 1182.92] If I like did that, and then I fixed it, there's no way I'd apologize.
[1182.92 → 1185.82] So now they just have this like nice smelling window.
[1185.92 → 1186.24] Yeah.
[1186.24 → 1187.04] They don't know why.
[1187.04 → 1187.18] Okay.
[1187.18 → 1188.48] Forget about the nice smelling window.
[1188.56 → 1189.04] That's stupid.
[1189.16 → 1189.88] It's just a window.
[1190.54 → 1190.98] Yeah.
[1191.22 → 1192.02] Just normal window.
[1192.12 → 1192.66] Normal window.
[1193.44 → 1195.86] I think that definitely means you're morally wrong.
[1196.26 → 1196.56] Okay.
[1196.70 → 1196.92] Yeah.
[1197.02 → 1197.24] Yeah.
[1197.24 → 1199.62] Morally wrong, but then morally right later.
[1200.24 → 1204.72] But, but obviously it's less right than if you hadn't done it in the first place.
[1206.24 → 1206.68] Yeah.
[1207.08 → 1207.68] All right.
[1208.06 → 1209.46] So we can move on.
[1209.46 → 1218.36] Um, the moral of the story is if your neighbour's car has GPS, okay.
[1218.36 → 1221.28] And a serial number, then don't take it.
[1221.90 → 1222.78] Oh man.
[1222.88 → 1228.44] And especially if you do take it, make sure you bring it back with the windows repaired.
[1229.24 → 1229.60] Okay.
[1229.70 → 1232.32] Is, is that fair to say that that is the moral of the story?
[1232.76 → 1235.64] Please don't, please don't clip this out of context.
[1235.64 → 1236.50] Ladies and gentlemen.
[1239.46 → 1240.22] All right.
[1240.24 → 1240.68] Oh my goodness.
[1241.32 → 1244.26] Why don't we jump right into our next topic here?
[1244.94 → 1249.72] Um, NCI US is back online, ladies and gentlemen.
[1250.02 → 1250.42] Oh yes.
[1250.56 → 1250.78] Okay.
[1250.88 → 1251.12] Okay.
[1251.18 → 1252.20] I'm not going to, no, no, no.
[1252.22 → 1253.10] You don't get to look at it yet.
[1253.18 → 1254.08] Don't spoil it, Luke.
[1254.16 → 1254.92] Don't spoil it.
[1254.98 → 1255.18] Okay.
[1255.30 → 1255.74] Hold on.
[1255.76 → 1257.40] I just got to add a window capture here.
[1257.52 → 1260.44] Got to get my, get my, get my window capture.
[1261.14 → 1262.34] Got to have more windows.
[1262.42 → 1262.70] Okay.
[1263.28 → 1264.64] Uh, window capture.
[1264.78 → 1264.92] Yeah.
[1264.92 → 1266.88] Existing one window capture two.
[1267.22 → 1270.12] I don't know what window capture two is, but it's, it's the right thing.
[1270.20 → 1271.68] So that was super lucky.
[1272.18 → 1272.54] Yay.
[1273.60 → 1276.36] Let's just make that a 16 by nine is kind of thing.
[1276.42 → 1276.98] We're looking at you.
[1276.98 → 1277.10] Okay.
[1277.10 → 1277.48] You ready?
[1277.76 → 1278.18] You ready?
[1278.84 → 1279.16] Okay.
[1279.24 → 1279.48] Okay.
[1279.52 → 1280.66] Is it, is it us?
[1281.20 → 1282.96] Man, that's such a it's such a ref.
[1283.06 → 1284.06] It's like muscle memory.
[1284.12 → 1286.06] I typed NCIX.com into my browser.
[1286.14 → 1286.88] I'm going to us.
[1286.98 → 1288.14] Nobody cared about the US site.
[1288.16 → 1289.90] It was totally the redheaded stepchild.
[1289.90 → 1290.96] Um, okay.
[1291.56 → 1293.92] NCIX.com.
[1294.56 → 1295.36] Here we go.
[1295.56 → 1296.80] Three, two, one.
[1297.34 → 1297.68] Enter.
[1299.30 → 1300.46] You ready for it, guys?
[1300.80 → 1302.38] Doesn't load that fast.
[1303.00 → 1304.00] It's not fast.
[1304.18 → 1305.90] Probably because the whole show is trying to access.
[1306.02 → 1306.58] Oh, wait.
[1306.64 → 1308.38] Are you guys going to ruin this for everybody?
[1310.16 → 1311.08] Oh, dang it.
[1311.10 → 1311.40] Oh, it's loading.
[1311.72 → 1312.12] Why does that?
[1312.30 → 1312.52] Okay.
[1312.56 → 1312.98] There we go.
[1313.04 → 1313.54] Here we go.
[1314.02 → 1314.92] Oh yeah.
[1315.04 → 1316.74] You see that hot pepper action?
[1318.62 → 1319.02] Sail.
[1319.02 → 1320.74] It's still working.
[1320.88 → 1323.36] I think they mean save 40 to 80%.
[1323.36 → 1323.90] Okay.
[1324.56 → 1326.64] Great discounts on the hottest items.
[1326.72 → 1327.44] We got that pepper.
[1327.56 → 1328.32] You got to hurry to buy.
[1328.42 → 1329.20] You're going to buy some pepper.
[1329.36 → 1329.56] Hold on.
[1329.60 → 1330.82] Let's have a look at what we got in here.
[1331.30 → 1332.26] Oh, final sale.
[1333.02 → 1336.88] 16 gig, a series Walkman video MP3.
[1337.72 → 1338.22] All right.
[1339.16 → 1340.10] Should I buy one?
[1340.92 → 1342.70] What even is this?
[1344.04 → 1344.44] Okay.
[1344.46 → 1345.34] So we got that.
[1345.76 → 1346.68] Uh, what else we got?
[1346.68 → 1349.34] We got the eight gig E series Walkman video.
[1349.34 → 1351.24] Is this just like a drop-ship site now?
[1351.56 → 1351.80] Okay.
[1351.86 → 1352.20] Hold on.
[1352.24 → 1352.52] Hold on.
[1352.70 → 1354.20] Luke, we're exploring together.
[1354.32 → 1355.80] I actually have not looked at it.
[1355.92 → 1356.74] Look at the about us.
[1356.86 → 1357.60] Look at the about us.
[1357.92 → 1358.68] The about us.
[1360.94 → 1362.62] 3993 Hanover Street.
[1363.46 → 1364.28] Call is free.
[1364.86 → 1366.52] Sales at example.com.
[1366.52 → 1372.30] Oh, no.
[1372.76 → 1373.52] About company.
[1373.60 → 1373.88] Hold on.
[1373.96 → 1375.54] Let's, let's, let's find out about us.
[1375.64 → 1379.14] Hey, this is actually the original URL and CIX.com slash contact.
[1379.26 → 1379.64] Oh, wait, no.
[1379.70 → 1380.74] It might've been contact us.
[1381.12 → 1381.48] You guys.
[1381.60 → 1382.08] Come on, guys.
[1382.12 → 1382.80] Everyone watching the show.
[1382.86 → 1385.44] You guys, you got to get off the site so that we can all enjoy it together here.
[1385.44 → 1385.74] All right.
[1386.54 → 1388.54] You got to, you got to help me out here.
[1389.00 → 1389.30] Okay.
[1389.30 → 1390.58] My WAN show brethren.
[1391.00 → 1391.78] What else we got?
[1391.82 → 1394.14] We got $30 white t-shirt.
[1394.14 → 1394.58] Okay.
[1395.80 → 1396.50] You know what?
[1396.58 → 1399.54] I know where you can, I know where you can get a better deal on a t-shirt.
[1400.82 → 1401.62] Buy a lot.
[1401.98 → 1402.86] Lttstore.com.
[1402.92 → 1406.08] By the way, this is your opportunity to vote, guys.
[1406.38 → 1407.86] You want me to shave the beard?
[1408.08 → 1409.38] You got to get the clean shirt.
[1409.92 → 1412.70] If you love the beard, you got to get the beard shirt.
[1412.84 → 1416.90] Whichever one sells more is what I'm going to keep for the rest of the year.
[1416.90 → 1417.24] What are the numbers right now?
[1417.74 → 1419.56] I actually have no idea.
[1420.88 → 1422.94] Nick doesn't, Nick doesn't tell me anything anymore.
[1422.94 → 1424.08] You should call them.
[1424.18 → 1425.34] They're open for one minute.
[1425.48 → 1426.12] No way.
[1426.22 → 1426.86] Are they open?
[1427.44 → 1427.72] Okay.
[1427.80 → 1428.46] Hold on a second.
[1428.78 → 1429.94] 6 p.m. on Friday.
[1430.12 → 1430.64] There's no.
[1430.82 → 1431.46] They're open for one minute.
[1431.56 → 1431.82] There's no.
[1431.86 → 1433.30] Oh, they're, well, they're in New York.
[1433.44 → 1435.04] Well, I mean, there may be in New York.
[1435.38 → 1436.42] We can give it a shot, though.
[1436.46 → 1437.14] We can give it a shot.
[1437.22 → 1437.40] Okay.
[1437.44 → 1437.62] Here.
[1437.68 → 1438.22] Hold on a second.
[1441.02 → 1441.38] Okay.
[1443.76 → 1444.08] Okay.
[1444.72 → 1445.36] It's free.
[1445.48 → 1446.50] It's free to call, apparently.
[1447.74 → 1448.52] Call is free.
[1449.98 → 1450.44] All right.
[1450.46 → 1451.40] Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1451.40 → 1452.60] Charges may apply.
[1452.94 → 1455.80] I just, I want to, I want to know.
[1456.08 → 1458.50] Our time to call is not in service at the moment.
[1458.84 → 1459.24] Okay.
[1459.84 → 1460.84] Not in service.
[1460.90 → 1461.54] Not in service.
[1461.68 → 1461.90] Not in service.
[1461.90 → 1463.22] I mean, are we surprised, Luke?
[1463.26 → 1464.64] Are we really that surprised?
[1465.12 → 1466.98] I mean, sales at example.com.
[1467.08 → 1468.70] Do you think you're going to get a bounce back, Luke?
[1469.26 → 1471.00] Think you're maybe going to get a bounce back?
[1471.80 → 1473.08] Also, I find it interesting.
[1473.08 → 1473.52] Oh.
[1473.52 → 1473.92] Oh.
[1473.92 → 1474.92] Oh.
[1478.36 → 1482.18] So, even the address and everything is Face.
[1482.60 → 1483.04] Oh.
[1483.74 → 1484.96] Do you, what about the reviews?
[1485.50 → 1488.56] You guys have the best customer service known to man.
[1488.56 → 1491.50] I have always been impressed with how fast you help us out.
[1491.88 → 1495.32] Meanwhile, the comment is from November 2013.
[1495.32 → 1496.32] Yeah.
[1496.32 → 1496.94] Ha ha ha.
[1499.34 → 1499.78] Yeah.
[1499.78 → 1502.02] Because, like, I noticed the, the how to reach us.
[1502.22 → 1504.22] It's so awkwardly specific.
[1504.62 → 1507.18] We are located near Hanover Street bus stop.
[1507.26 → 1512.04] Once you get off the bus, walk towards the bank and turn left by the entrance.
[1512.18 → 1513.92] Walk 200 meters and turn right.
[1513.92 → 1517.50] Now, go down the street until you see the demo store sign.
[1517.68 → 1517.88] What?
[1517.88 → 1520.10] Enter the doors under this sign.
[1520.34 → 1520.82] What?
[1521.28 → 1521.76] Seriously?
[1522.80 → 1523.24] Yeah.
[1523.24 → 1526.00] That's ridiculously specific.
[1526.60 → 1531.78] I mean, for all I know, maybe that's a totally normal thing for New York-based stores
[1531.78 → 1533.92] because it can be a bit of a maze there.
[1534.44 → 1535.52] I will say that.
[1536.34 → 1540.24] Look at, look at, just highlight your mouse over the video games' category.
[1540.56 → 1543.54] Also, yeah, none of those, none of those things at the top load.
[1543.92 → 1544.52] Okay.
[1544.80 → 1545.30] Video games.
[1545.46 → 1552.14] Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, X-Box 1.
[1553.20 → 1555.14] And what's with these brands?
[1555.68 → 1559.84] Like, if we go on the, on the main page, I had it loaded before, but I'm having a bit
[1559.84 → 1560.72] of a hard time now.
[1560.80 → 1565.76] But the, the brands that they carry are so random.
[1566.08 → 1571.94] Like, make, holy crap, creative Zen touch to contact us for price.
[1571.94 → 1574.34] Are you even kidding?
[1574.88 → 1576.70] Like, price too low to show.
[1577.66 → 1579.28] Wildwood City Classic bike.
[1579.58 → 1584.48] The page is just like basically completely dead for me now, unfortunately, at this point.
[1584.48 → 1589.66] But I was having way too much fun with this, and I would have loved to enjoy it some more.
[1589.70 → 1593.54] Yes, cell phones, Apple iPhone, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung.
[1593.96 → 1596.32] You know what's kind of bizarre though, Luke?
[1596.32 → 1603.70] Is some of these things actually look kind of weirdly familiar.
[1604.92 → 1608.88] Like, MP3 speaker systems, right?
[1609.62 → 1613.02] Who would call it MP3 speaker system?
[1613.70 → 1620.34] That's not a terminology that's like ever been used by anyone ever, except NCI.
[1620.34 → 1620.58] NCI.
[1623.18 → 1629.72] Part of me is actually kind of wondering if if some aspect of this is running on the NCI
[1629.72 → 1630.30] backend.
[1631.76 → 1634.30] It could also just be like, like I.
[1634.84 → 1636.18] They're trying to launch it.
[1636.24 → 1639.70] Like if this demo store thing, whatever, whatever company, actually.
[1641.58 → 1644.98] Powered by multivendor shopping cart software, Sim Tech.
[1645.78 → 1646.26] Sim Tech.
[1646.26 → 1648.96] Like, yeah, maybe not then.
[1649.04 → 1649.58] Maybe not.
[1650.40 → 1651.06] Yeah, it's just weird.
[1651.28 → 1652.62] Yeah, so this brand stuff.
[1652.76 → 1656.82] So the logo, the four boxes with the one extra box thing and all that kind of stuff.
[1656.86 → 1663.04] That is this CS cart, like, like pre-done framework thingy that they're using.
[1664.06 → 1665.96] Okay, like the similar products one?
[1667.56 → 1670.20] No, just the logo, the demo store thing.
[1670.32 → 1670.88] Oh, okay.
[1670.88 → 1674.90] So like whatever platform they're running or framework or whatever this is.
[1674.98 → 1675.18] Yeah.
[1675.18 → 1679.30] Um, they, they could have just tried to port whatever they had over.
[1681.12 → 1681.60] Interesting.
[1682.16 → 1686.18] And like NCI had console stuff.
[1686.56 → 1686.84] They did.
[1686.96 → 1687.48] They did.
[1687.56 → 1691.96] And it was like the, the, the generation of stuff is kind of right.
[1692.22 → 1692.52] Kind of lines up.
[1692.94 → 1693.42] Yeah.
[1693.92 → 1695.48] It's really weird.
[1695.48 → 1700.34] Like, and things like, like grouping, grouping printers and scanners together.
[1700.92 → 1703.46] Like, I'm pretty sure that's a thing we did.
[1703.46 → 1704.56] It's been a long time.
[1705.38 → 1712.94] It's all stuff like apparel and sports and outdoors is probably just extra categories that came with the demo store software.
[1713.34 → 1713.66] Yeah.
[1714.04 → 1715.42] That kind of makes sense.
[1715.42 → 1719.18] And I'm just like, I'm looking at some of this weird stuff.
[1719.18 → 1720.56] Like the okay.
[1720.58 → 1721.40] I don't, I don't know.
[1721.48 → 1725.22] I don't know about like the series, a series Walkman video.
[1725.22 → 1731.54] I don't know if that's like the kind of random dead stock thing that might've still been showing, you know, in stock or something like that.
[1731.54 → 1737.86] And as far as I can tell, there's no reference to the type of SKU numbers that I know that NCI used.
[1738.00 → 1745.30] So it's hard for me to say exactly what's going on here, but it's really weird.
[1745.90 → 1746.64] Really weird.
[1746.70 → 1747.90] I can say that much for sure.
[1747.90 → 1756.54] Home slash brand is a really weird mix of like the most generic companies that someone would throw on something ever.
[1757.26 → 1763.42] Plus like D-Link and Cisco because there's some NCX stuff in there.
[1763.60 → 1763.98] You know what I mean?
[1764.36 → 1764.80] Yeah.
[1764.86 → 1767.16] Like they have Microsoft, but then they have like Mont Blanc.
[1768.72 → 1769.60] Really weird.
[1769.76 → 1769.92] Okay.
[1770.04 → 1771.02] My MP3.
[1771.30 → 1771.82] Oh, what is it?
[1771.86 → 1773.00] Home slash brand?
[1773.00 → 1773.04] Home slash brand?
[1774.48 → 1775.48] I think so.
[1775.74 → 1778.74] The page is having a lot of issues for me right now.
[1778.74 → 1779.20] Home slash brand.
[1779.30 → 1779.46] Yeah.
[1779.54 → 1781.08] I'm having a real hard time here.
[1781.52 → 1783.24] I think we hugged it a little bit.
[1783.32 → 1783.58] Yeah.
[1783.66 → 1785.06] I think we love hugged it to death.
[1785.20 → 1785.58] Okay.
[1786.14 → 1787.18] Well, that's fine.
[1787.32 → 1790.12] I can live with what we've seen so far.
[1790.24 → 1793.84] I think that's, you know, here's what I'll say.
[1794.38 → 1795.30] Good luck, guys.
[1795.30 → 1814.16] I truly do wish you the best of luck with the offshoot in really never very successful domain for the US that never had anything in stock of my old employer.
[1814.16 → 1816.94] Go to where?
[1817.08 → 1817.20] Sorry.
[1817.20 → 1820.18] CS-cart.com.
[1820.26 → 1821.26] You don't actually need to go.
[1822.00 → 1830.12] And you go through their marketplace software, and you select demo, which is the specific demo store.
[1830.20 → 1831.00] We're seeing that everywhere.
[1831.38 → 1841.58] One of their options, once you jump through it, if you select all the things that you would select if you were NCI, once you get to option five, there's I'm migrating from another e-commerce platform data transfer.
[1842.82 → 1843.30] Interesting.
[1843.30 → 1843.54] Interesting.
[1845.52 → 1848.50] I'm, yeah, here, I'm just going to bring this back up.
[1848.84 → 1850.30] I'm migrating data transfer required.
[1851.14 → 1851.44] Okay.
[1852.54 → 1853.62] You know what, though?
[1853.72 → 1864.98] I really doubt that there'd be, I mean, I guess it would all just be like, at the end of the day, there would be a database solution of some sort.
[1865.20 → 1867.44] Like, I never obviously poked around.
[1867.68 → 1869.66] And so NCI was custom coded.
[1870.08 → 1872.70] For better or for worse, it was their own homebrew thing.
[1873.38 → 1874.02] Mostly worse.
[1875.68 → 1891.46] And so, but even if it was like some weirdo random thing, the database would contain fields that could be, I guess, if you're willing to get manual enough with it, could be ingested into someone else's platform.
[1891.46 → 1896.32] Things like SKU or vendor part number or description or colour.
[1896.60 → 1897.84] They didn't have a field for colour.
[1898.08 → 1899.38] It's like, oh, really?
[1899.60 → 1903.88] That was why we had to have separate product pages for every single variant of a device.
[1903.92 → 1904.88] I remember that.
[1905.02 → 1906.12] Like, oh, man.
[1906.22 → 1906.50] It was weird.
[1906.50 → 1910.10] There were advantages to doing it that way.
[1910.10 → 1918.44] You know, it meant that when a person went on a product page, and it said in stock, it was like definitely in stock, not like some variants of it are in stock.
[1918.56 → 1922.32] Except when it wasn't in stock because our stock wasn't accurate a lot of the time.
[1922.42 → 1923.18] Like, except for that.
[1923.18 → 1937.78] I still remember like the amount of pushback internally when the decision was made by the higher ups to start reflecting in stock at a nearby supplier as in stock on the website.
[1937.78 → 1943.62] Or in stock at one of our retail stores as in stock on the website.
[1944.04 → 1948.36] Because what that meant was people would order something thinking it's going to ship right away.
[1948.98 → 1952.10] And most of the time, like we could do store transfers.
[1952.24 → 1954.06] We had trucks going every day to every store.
[1954.74 → 1964.52] But most of the time, the purchaser would like to try to bring one in from outside because it's actually very time-consuming to do inters tore transfers.
[1965.08 → 1966.80] And it would take a couple of days.
[1966.80 → 1968.80] And people would then get mad.
[1969.04 → 1971.40] It's like, come on.
[1971.44 → 1976.52] And even if you do have it in stock at the store, generally speaking, trucks went out in the morning and then back at the end of the day.
[1977.64 → 1979.74] No, they went to each store and then back.
[1979.74 → 1984.10] So if it was one of the stores that you hit in the morning, then it might go out that day.
[1984.14 → 1988.04] But if it was one of the stores that you hit near the end of the day, then it wouldn't go out that day.
[1988.08 → 1989.76] And it would be delayed by at least a day.
[1989.82 → 1991.60] So people would get mad about that as well.
[1991.68 → 1992.92] It was just stupid.
[1993.04 → 1995.36] There was a bunch of pushbacks, but we never changed it.
[1995.36 → 1997.08] And it created so many customer service issues.
[1997.08 → 1998.22] And it was just totally unnecessary.
[1998.90 → 2001.04] And lttstore.com will never treat you that way.
[2001.78 → 2006.54] When we say we're in stock, we are in stock, except when we like actually aren't.
[2006.68 → 2008.94] Because it says, guys, this is a pre-printed thing.
[2009.44 → 2014.38] And I had someone chase me about a pre-printed shirt pretty aggressively.
[2014.38 → 2016.22] Like, wait, why isn't it here yet?
[2016.34 → 2019.56] I'm like, well, because we said it was a pre-order campaign.
[2020.50 → 2022.32] We didn't say it would be there yet.
[2024.12 → 2024.78] I'm sorry.
[2024.78 → 2031.68] So I found NCXUS.com on the Wayback Machine from 2014.
[2032.10 → 2032.42] Nice.
[2032.58 → 2033.42] Do you want to send me that link?
[2034.80 → 2037.78] Hit me on Hangouts.
[2037.78 → 2040.46] That would be the easiest thing for me to copy into a thing.
[2041.58 → 2042.20] When's the...
[2042.20 → 2042.34] Okay.
[2042.50 → 2044.26] So this is actually from 2016.
[2044.68 → 2045.78] But the site was still...
[2046.74 → 2047.16] All right.
[2047.80 → 2048.96] Hit me up.
[2050.00 → 2052.62] I can't believe how long that website was up.
[2052.84 → 2056.90] And like seemingly still taking orders after they had declared bankruptcy.
[2056.90 → 2058.62] And there was no hope of it coming back.
[2059.78 → 2060.18] Yeah.
[2060.18 → 2063.30] That was absolutely ridiculous.
[2064.82 → 2069.40] That like should have been a much bigger problem, I think.
[2070.88 → 2073.08] Waiting for Hangouts to load.
[2073.80 → 2074.42] Oh, seriously?
[2075.52 → 2076.46] Oh, right.
[2076.50 → 2080.04] I guess you probably don't have that there browser window open there, bud.
[2080.84 → 2084.22] Got to get that there browser window open, bud.
[2084.94 → 2086.16] Oh, my goodness.
[2087.06 → 2089.50] Every module has to take three years to load.
[2089.50 → 2089.92] There we go.
[2089.92 → 2091.60] I believe in you.
[2092.04 → 2092.58] All right.
[2092.60 → 2093.08] Here we go.
[2093.14 → 2094.72] You guys ready to go way back?
[2095.10 → 2097.84] We're going to go back on the way back machine.
[2099.20 → 2100.00] NCI US.
[2101.06 → 2101.46] Wow.
[2101.98 → 2102.74] Look at these.
[2102.74 → 2104.14] This is a clear shot by product.
[2104.28 → 2105.60] Look at these categories.
[2105.82 → 2106.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2107.08 → 2108.32] I know what it is.
[2108.82 → 2109.66] I just...
[2109.66 → 2110.16] You know.
[2110.40 → 2110.88] I know.
[2110.88 → 2113.14] I didn't link you to the homepage.
[2113.56 → 2113.68] Okay.
[2113.78 → 2115.68] So printers and scanners.
[2116.00 → 2116.18] Okay.
[2116.26 → 2117.16] So control F.
[2117.82 → 2118.26] Printers.
[2118.26 → 2120.52] I didn't see the MP3 speaker thing.
[2120.68 → 2120.88] No?
[2121.00 → 2121.30] Okay.
[2121.42 → 2121.62] Okay.
[2121.68 → 2124.66] So maybe this is just someone else.
[2125.38 → 2126.76] Oh, I missed the...
[2126.76 → 2129.08] Oh, I missed the sale event art.
[2130.08 → 2132.36] That's a weird thing to be nostalgic about, maybe.
[2133.14 → 2133.88] Hey, Tom.
[2134.32 → 2135.22] You know what?
[2135.22 → 2136.46] Uh...
[2136.46 → 2142.20] I know there used to be a website where he archived all that stuff.
[2142.96 → 2143.40] Uh...
[2143.40 → 2143.98] Oh, man.
[2144.04 → 2145.38] What was it called?
[2146.72 → 2148.22] NCI Banner Vault.
[2149.64 → 2150.48] Something like that.
[2150.50 → 2152.22] Power up for the playoff sales event.
[2152.36 → 2153.24] Slashing prices.
[2153.86 → 2155.02] Free shipping over $100.
[2156.48 → 2156.78] Whoa.
[2156.78 → 2158.78] I think it actually might have...
[2160.20 → 2163.58] Been on thebannervault.com.
[2164.66 → 2165.10] It's gone.
[2165.10 → 2165.54] That brings a note.
[2165.94 → 2166.58] It's gone.
[2166.70 → 2166.86] Yeah.
[2166.94 → 2167.78] So here's a thread.
[2168.04 → 2171.48] Here's a thread from our forum from a thousand years ago.
[2173.56 → 2174.62] Thebannervault.com.
[2174.74 → 2178.54] But unfortunately, thebannervault.com is down.
[2179.82 → 2181.88] See ya, bannervault.com.
[2181.94 → 2183.18] It was nice knowing ya.
[2183.18 → 2187.34] Yeah, so in Net linked Weekly Episode 1,
[2188.16 → 2191.40] you mention it, and it is in the description.
[2192.66 → 2193.10] Huh.
[2193.50 → 2194.04] All right.
[2194.40 → 2195.22] Well, that's a shame.
[2195.28 → 2196.56] Yeah, they were really cool.
[2196.72 → 2200.94] He would spend pretty much most of his week on the sale banner.
[2201.20 → 2202.82] So, like, most of the beginning of the week.
[2202.90 → 2205.00] So it was like three days worth of artwork,
[2205.14 → 2206.24] and I really liked his style.
[2206.70 → 2210.46] And then he would work on sort of other graphic designer stuff
[2210.46 → 2211.72] on the other couple of days.
[2211.72 → 2213.32] I wonder what happened to him.
[2213.42 → 2215.56] He was a good egg.
[2215.74 → 2216.54] I really liked him.
[2217.80 → 2219.18] Really easy to work with.
[2220.68 → 2222.96] There are a few people there that, like, I really miss,
[2223.02 → 2226.76] and they just did not deserve to go down with that ship at all.
[2228.24 → 2229.50] Yeah, hopefully he's doing all right.
[2230.36 → 2230.92] All right.
[2230.96 → 2233.52] Why don't we move on to some more tech news here, ladies and gentlemen,
[2233.74 → 2236.08] after this message from Ridge Wallet.
[2236.66 → 2238.68] Stop carrying pointless items around in your pocket,
[2238.76 → 2239.86] like receipts, old hotel rooms.
[2239.94 → 2240.46] Oh, wow.
[2240.46 → 2241.58] I have the best.
[2241.64 → 2241.82] Okay.
[2242.36 → 2242.80] Nope.
[2243.08 → 2246.60] Can you do the Need for Seat one?
[2246.78 → 2247.64] I will be right back.
[2248.14 → 2249.04] Do you have the target points?
[2249.20 → 2249.54] One sec.
[2249.80 → 2250.66] I can get them.
[2251.52 → 2255.36] Need for Seat is a dealer of Taxonomic gaming chairs.
[2255.62 → 2258.66] These chairs are great, comfortable, and reliable.
[2259.16 → 2262.16] They have a variety of sizes and selections for everyone.
[2262.16 → 2265.44] They also offer a custom embroidery service.
[2265.64 → 2265.92] Cool.
[2266.12 → 2266.54] Interesting.
[2267.26 → 2271.10] They have a 30-day return policy and a two-year warranty.
[2271.54 → 2273.16] You can check them out at what it's, hopefully.
[2273.32 → 2273.62] Yes.
[2273.90 → 2274.76] The link below.
[2275.40 → 2275.88] Fantastic.
[2275.88 → 2281.62] And that's all I have for you for Need for Seat.
[2281.62 → 2291.00] I believe, yes, my office chair at Linus Hectic's office, which I have not sat in a while now,
[2291.22 → 2292.06] is a Taxonomic.
[2292.44 → 2293.16] Fairly comfy.
[2293.16 → 2296.50] Has served me for a long time at this point.
[2296.82 → 2298.44] I don't know what he's searching for.
[2301.50 → 2307.28] Some people have pointed out that thebannervault.com is accessible on the Wayback Machine.
[2307.42 → 2310.52] We probably should have thought about that while we were on the Wayback Machine.
[2312.14 → 2313.70] But, you know, whatever.
[2314.66 → 2317.68] And, yeah, some of these banners are freaking legit, man.
[2318.32 → 2318.96] I don't know.
[2319.00 → 2319.44] It's cool.
[2319.44 → 2323.42] I genuinely liked this stuff.
[2324.78 → 2327.42] I used to look at every single...
[2327.42 → 2330.22] They had a sale every week, by the way.
[2331.92 → 2334.22] And I used to look at every single sale banner.
[2336.54 → 2337.16] All right.
[2337.26 → 2337.82] Well, bummer.
[2338.58 → 2339.20] Oh, sorry.
[2339.30 → 2339.62] Were you done?
[2340.74 → 2341.86] I've done the Need for Seat thing.
[2341.92 → 2347.86] I was pointing out that someone pointed out to me in chat that thebannervault.com is on the Wayback Machine.
[2348.36 → 2349.08] Oh, cool.
[2349.66 → 2349.94] Okay.
[2349.98 → 2350.56] Well, that's great.
[2351.68 → 2351.90] Yeah.
[2352.06 → 2352.56] Need for Seat.
[2352.70 → 2353.22] Need for Seat.
[2353.66 → 2354.70] Taxonomic Gaming Chairs.
[2355.26 → 2355.66] Yeah.
[2355.82 → 2356.64] I love them.
[2356.74 → 2358.02] And they have custom embroidery service.
[2358.36 → 2361.12] That same chair that I reviewed five years ago is still my daily driver.
[2361.28 → 2363.10] It still looks and feels great.
[2363.82 → 2364.02] Yeah.
[2364.08 → 2370.26] I pointed out that my office chair at the Linus Tech Tips office is a Taxonomic.
[2370.26 → 2370.70] Okay.
[2371.38 → 2371.78] Okay.
[2372.38 → 2374.44] And sponsor the other one.
[2374.52 → 2375.22] Ridge Wallet.
[2375.30 → 2375.44] Yeah.
[2375.56 → 2380.76] I found my old wallet from like university the other day because I was...
[2380.76 → 2380.88] Yeah.
[2380.94 → 2384.62] I emptied out my attic a little while ago and there was so much pointless garbage in it.
[2385.02 → 2386.96] I have a future shop store credit.
[2388.30 → 2388.58] Nice.
[2388.80 → 2389.94] What else did I have in there?
[2389.94 → 2391.02] I had like...
[2391.02 → 2392.96] I had not just my Godard.
[2393.10 → 2395.14] So that's like our student transit pass.
[2395.56 → 2399.44] But I had my wife's old Godard from when we were in university.
[2399.70 → 2401.10] Like an expired one of hers.
[2401.56 → 2402.94] I guess because like...
[2402.94 → 2406.94] You got to remember back then like printing out a picture was not as trivial as it is today.
[2407.34 → 2408.10] It was like the only...
[2408.10 → 2410.02] It was like the picture of her I had in my wallet.
[2410.38 → 2411.82] Which is sort of pathetic I guess.
[2413.50 → 2414.78] What else did I have in there?
[2415.92 → 2418.56] Obviously I wouldn't show this, but I had an old driver's license in there.
[2418.74 → 2419.70] So that was pretty cool.
[2419.84 → 2423.46] Anyway it was just kind of neat, and it reminded me of Ridge Wallet because I had a lot of really
[2423.46 → 2424.20] pointless garbage.
[2424.20 → 2430.06] I had like business cards from like random things that I would never consider caring about at all.
[2430.70 → 2431.40] I had...
[2431.40 → 2434.46] Oh I had all my old like life-saving certificates in there.
[2434.86 → 2441.88] My super expired like CPR certificate and like water safety instructor and like all that kind of crap.
[2442.28 → 2444.10] So anyway Ridge Wallet helps you not do that.
[2444.20 → 2445.04] They help you carry less.
[2445.56 → 2449.88] They use two metal plates that are bound together by a strong elastic band to help you keep your cards
[2449.88 → 2451.28] tightly together but still accessible.
[2451.78 → 2452.84] They're RFID blocking.
[2452.84 → 2456.78] They offer a lifetime guarantee, and they're available in aluminum, carbon fibre and titanium.
[2457.14 → 2458.18] They don't just sell wallets.
[2458.28 → 2460.54] They have battery banks, bags, smartphone covers and more.
[2460.88 → 2462.74] And a Ridge Wallet's great as a Father's Day gift.
[2462.90 → 2463.16] P.S.
[2463.16 → 2464.24] It's coming up June 21st.
[2464.26 → 2464.66] Holy crap.
[2464.74 → 2466.10] It's coming up on June 21st.
[2466.14 → 2466.84] I have to...
[2467.78 → 2468.88] I probably don't need to do much.
[2468.96 → 2469.84] I think my dad's pretty chill.
[2470.08 → 2474.54] Use offer code Linus to save 10% on everything at ridge.com slash Linus.
[2474.88 → 2475.10] Woo!
[2475.10 → 2475.30] Woo!
[2476.48 → 2477.16] There we go.
[2478.38 → 2478.94] You know what?
[2479.10 → 2479.78] Could be...
[2479.78 → 2480.20] I don't know.
[2480.36 → 2484.76] I have rethought this, and I no longer think it's that amazing.
[2484.98 → 2487.52] But looking at this NCX...
[2487.52 → 2490.02] A hammer that can do everything.
[2490.56 → 2490.82] Right?
[2492.48 → 2494.44] That's what he bought for his dad a long time ago.
[2494.54 → 2495.16] Never got it.
[2495.30 → 2495.68] Kickstarter.
[2496.06 → 2497.32] That was for Christmas.
[2497.56 → 2497.74] Okay.
[2497.80 → 2498.02] Sorry.
[2498.02 → 2498.28] Whatever.
[2498.28 → 2498.40] Whatever.
[2499.70 → 2500.34] But yeah.
[2501.58 → 2502.02] Yeah.
[2502.16 → 2502.76] It's not as cool.
[2502.82 → 2504.42] It's a bad gift, and you're a bad son either way.
[2504.84 → 2512.84] I thought going to way back machine versions of like computer hardware websites and configuring
[2512.84 → 2516.84] a computer on there that costs a certain amount and then configuring a computer now that
[2516.84 → 2517.58] costs a certain amount.
[2517.84 → 2519.14] That's a really cool idea.
[2519.24 → 2519.94] I love it.
[2520.78 → 2524.18] My only reason why I thought it might not be that crazy is because you could literally
[2524.18 → 2526.38] just go back to your videos from that era.
[2528.28 → 2529.28] Wow.
[2530.62 → 2532.64] What a dick.
[2535.60 → 2539.86] I guess you couldn't bench that computer against current things.
[2540.36 → 2540.58] Huh?
[2540.90 → 2542.02] What a dick.
[2542.64 → 2543.08] Huh?
[2544.64 → 2545.20] Benefits?
[2545.34 → 2545.88] So rude.
[2546.30 → 2546.84] So rude.
[2547.20 → 2548.96] So I guess, you know, I don't know.
[2549.04 → 2552.50] Maybe you don't need to do that because you probably remember what it was like when dinosaurs
[2552.50 → 2553.66] roamed the earth.
[2554.48 → 2554.80] What?
[2554.98 → 2557.30] This isn't even that long ago.
[2557.30 → 2557.92] I understand you.
[2557.92 → 2559.00] I understand you, family.
[2559.28 → 2560.30] I understand you.
[2560.92 → 2561.68] I know what happened there.
[2562.86 → 2567.08] The horrible year when man ran from dinosaurs.
[2567.20 → 2567.38] Yeah.
[2568.30 → 2569.72] Dinosaurs, they fast.
[2569.84 → 2570.62] You got to watch out.
[2570.92 → 2571.56] They're fast.
[2572.78 → 2573.46] All right.
[2573.58 → 2575.24] They got some more tech news for you guys.
[2575.56 → 2582.50] AMD implies RDNA 2 Big Nazi is going to release four PC before the next gen consoles, calling
[2582.50 → 2583.50] it a Halo product.
[2583.50 → 2586.28] So that would mean it should be coming in the next few months.
[2586.28 → 2592.46] Given how few engineering boards showing up on shipping.
[2592.46 → 2596.12] What are they called?
[2596.12 → 2598.10] Not commercial invoices.
[2598.26 → 2600.14] What's the other thing that a shipping thing comes with?
[2600.18 → 2600.74] Packing lists.
[2601.42 → 2602.88] Like shipping packing lists and stuff.
[2603.46 → 2605.04] Given how few of those we've seen.
[2605.04 → 2607.00] I don't know.
[2607.00 → 2612.70] It seems like that's kind of hard to believe, but also you never know.
[2613.48 → 2616.56] And if they say they're going to do it, I mean, they've kind of delivered on a lot of
[2616.56 → 2617.16] stuff lately.
[2617.16 → 2625.04] So when asked by a host, blah, blah, blah, AM CFO Devin der Kumar said, how should we
[2625.04 → 2626.62] think about AMD's GPU roadmap?
[2626.86 → 2630.38] He said, taking the same approach for GPUs that they took on the CPU side.
[2630.50 → 2630.78] Interesting.
[2631.28 → 2635.34] So there's a lot of excitement for Nazi 2, or what our fans have dubbed Big Nazi, and
[2635.34 → 2641.52] it's a Halo product, which means that we can expect it to compete at the top end of the
[2641.52 → 2643.02] graphics card market.
[2643.02 → 2648.58] With that said, it's been so long since AMD has had a competitive product in that segment
[2648.58 → 2654.48] that, and okay, you know, it's really hard when you've kind of had a relationship with
[2654.48 → 2659.12] not just the brand, like not just the logo, but just with like the people at a company
[2659.12 → 2660.16] for so many years.
[2660.50 → 2665.72] It's hard to put that history aside, but I'll say this, you know, there's probably a reason
[2665.72 → 2667.80] that Dr. Sue was the highest paid CEO.
[2668.02 → 2668.90] I think it was last year.
[2669.04 → 2669.80] You see that article?
[2670.54 → 2670.94] No.
[2670.94 → 2676.08] She made like $56 million or something like that with all the performance-based bonuses.
[2676.28 → 2678.54] Her base salary is actually very reasonable.
[2679.98 → 2681.58] Elon's going to dunk her for this year.
[2682.18 → 2685.66] I think that's different though, because I think that wasn't...
[2685.66 → 2687.28] It's going to say a performance-based bonus?
[2687.76 → 2690.12] Yeah, but hold on a second.
[2690.28 → 2690.72] Let's see.
[2691.68 → 2694.24] I'm just going to check my source here.
[2694.24 → 2695.96] So, blah, blah, blah.
[2696.04 → 2700.42] In the S&P 500 last year, earned a total of $58.5 million.
[2701.66 → 2704.02] Almost $13 million more than whatever.
[2704.40 → 2706.60] Yeah, so I guess it depends on how it's classified.
[2707.08 → 2709.30] Is his bonus just like a check?
[2709.30 → 2712.74] And like, how is that possibly more than what Bezos got paid?
[2713.78 → 2721.34] Well, Bezos might have cashed in stock that he owned, but that was not necessarily his compensation.
[2721.34 → 2724.08] Or gained more stock, potentially.
[2724.72 → 2725.90] Yeah, but I...
[2725.90 → 2726.10] Okay.
[2726.30 → 2726.62] All right.
[2726.68 → 2726.92] All right.
[2727.00 → 2727.20] Look.
[2727.38 → 2727.60] Look.
[2727.68 → 2727.84] Look.
[2727.90 → 2728.10] Look.
[2728.22 → 2729.34] Hold on a second.
[2729.62 → 2730.40] Give me a sec.
[2730.54 → 2730.90] Okay?
[2732.12 → 2733.58] DA-da-da-da-da-da.
[2733.78 → 2735.44] One million in base salary.
[2735.92 → 2738.42] 1.2 million in performance-based bonus.
[2738.98 → 2740.48] Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
[2740.48 → 2742.04] Oh, man.
[2742.20 → 2744.06] You're making my life difficult here.
[2745.66 → 2747.72] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2747.92 → 2748.26] Sorry.
[2748.54 → 2749.12] There's just...
[2749.12 → 2756.18] There are a lot of different ways that CEOs get compensated, and this might just be sort of like one basic way.
[2756.20 → 2757.98] Dude, he's worth $150 billion.
[2758.50 → 2759.88] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[2762.58 → 2762.90] Okay.
[2762.96 → 2764.68] GGR stock gained by...
[2764.68 → 2765.76] Oh, this is making...
[2765.76 → 2768.10] That's so unfathomably ridiculous.
[2768.76 → 2770.08] It is a lot of money.
[2770.16 → 2771.80] Anyway, the point is...
[2771.80 → 2773.24] The point I'm trying to make...
[2773.24 → 2773.46] Whatever.
[2773.58 → 2775.82] She got paid a lot, and it was all performance-based bonuses.
[2776.00 → 2778.74] The company is a different company under her, as far as I can tell.
[2778.98 → 2785.40] So even though all these years of, you know, interacting with AMD, I've been sort of strung along.
[2785.60 → 2786.02] Strung along.
[2786.08 → 2786.94] It's going to be perfect this time.
[2787.06 → 2787.94] It's going to be perfect this time.
[2787.98 → 2788.80] It's going to be perfect this time.
[2788.80 → 2790.90] I've been strung along and disappointed a lot of times.
[2791.36 → 2792.62] Hasn't happened a lot lately.
[2793.26 → 2794.94] So maybe this will be different.
[2795.24 → 2796.24] Maybe it's going to be awesome.
[2796.24 → 2796.32] Awesome.
[2796.90 → 2798.88] Let's hope for the best.
[2799.04 → 2807.70] Because, you know, whether it's NVIDIA's pricing or whether it's their, you know, relationship with Sony and Microsoft.
[2807.86 → 2809.06] That's a weird one, you know, Microsoft.
[2809.60 → 2817.62] Whatever it is, NVIDIA doesn't seem to be even interested in competing in consoles, at least not at whatever margins they can make on them.
[2817.62 → 2823.02] So the better AMD does, the better an entire generation of gaming hardware is going to be.
[2823.14 → 2830.08] And the better the target that game developers are going to be aiming at with the quality of their games.
[2830.12 → 2831.74] And therefore, the better they're going to look on the PC.
[2832.00 → 2833.92] So I'm rooting for big Nazi.
[2834.46 → 2834.84] There.
[2834.92 → 2835.76] They do Switch.
[2837.28 → 2838.32] That's true.
[2839.12 → 2840.24] NVIDIA is in the Switch.
[2840.34 → 2841.44] I forgot about that.
[2841.44 → 2844.34] And there's kind of a lot of Switches being pumped out.
[2844.34 → 2845.56] So that's true.
[2845.66 → 2849.78] But the Switch doesn't dictate the visual fidelity of an entire generation of games.
[2850.50 → 2850.62] Totally.
[2850.80 → 2855.16] I'm just saying it's not like NVIDIA is out of the console space, technically.
[2855.34 → 2856.10] That's true.
[2856.26 → 2856.98] The Switch.
[2857.86 → 2858.12] Yeah.
[2858.68 → 2859.62] And the Switch.
[2860.62 → 2860.80] Yeah.
[2860.80 → 2862.26] And not the Wii U before it.
[2862.58 → 2863.24] Or the Wii.
[2863.50 → 2864.82] Or the Game Cube before that.
[2865.24 → 2866.04] The Switch.
[2867.16 → 2867.40] Yep.
[2867.40 → 2868.24] They got that one.
[2869.20 → 2870.64] They're technically in there.
[2872.12 → 2877.94] So they remain on track to launch next generation Zen 3 and RDNA 2 GPUs in late 2020.
[2879.46 → 2883.38] Regarding who they'll be for, blah, blah, blah, all the way up to Enthusiast, larger ecosystem.
[2884.74 → 2889.62] Man, these are a lot of very dense notes with not a lot of like takeaways here.
[2889.90 → 2891.36] But thanks anyway, Anthony.
[2891.52 → 2891.82] Oh, yeah.
[2891.90 → 2892.42] That's okay.
[2892.46 → 2893.44] That would be an Anthony thing.
[2893.44 → 2898.92] And that's the thing is like as much as our writing staff adds so much expertise to our team,
[2899.30 → 2905.08] I'm 100% sure that there's still a value to having me there just to make it digestible sometimes.
[2908.08 → 2908.86] Love you, Anthony.
[2911.14 → 2915.66] One of our other actually pretty exciting looking topics.
[2917.02 → 2917.74] Leon 10 nanometre.
[2917.88 → 2922.62] This is from Alex who posted in here, and it's William CLL on the forum.
[2922.62 → 2932.02] There were three Geek bench 4 submissions of an Ice Lake desktop CPU that appear to be server CPUs.
[2932.36 → 2934.58] And by desktop, I don't mean desktop versus server.
[2934.72 → 2936.20] I mean like not a laptop.
[2937.16 → 2942.10] So they have rumoured support for PCIe 4.0 and DDR4-3200.
[2942.10 → 2950.62] And the specs that we've got from this Geek bench poll are 24 cores, 48 threads, base clock of 2.2 gigahertz, boost of 2.9.
[2952.00 → 2954.78] I can't add up all this cache in my head.
[2955.22 → 2956.74] 32 kilobytes times 24.
[2956.90 → 2957.32] Go, Luke.
[2957.32 → 2960.02] That's the level one instruction cache.
[2960.34 → 2961.86] Okay, you ready for the level one data cache?
[2961.94 → 2963.28] 48 kilobytes times 24.
[2963.78 → 2965.12] Okay, add that to the previous one.
[2965.12 → 2967.94] Level two cache, 1.25 megabytes times 24.
[2968.18 → 2969.94] And then we've got a level three cache that's 36.
[2970.36 → 2971.34] And what is it?
[2972.16 → 2972.86] I have no idea.
[2973.06 → 2973.88] Well, all right, you tried.
[2974.32 → 2975.70] So the Ice Lake chip scored...
[2975.70 → 2977.46] My dad would know already, but I have no idea.
[2977.46 → 2979.38] 4,100 points single threaded.
[2979.62 → 2986.52] For context, Intel's current 14 nanometres Leon Gold 6212U scores 4772.
[2986.90 → 2987.88] So that's faster.
[2988.20 → 2993.20] But the new Ice Lake is much faster in multithreaded, about 9.2% faster.
[2994.34 → 2995.44] So, yeah.
[2997.32 → 2998.72] That's neat, I guess.
[3001.46 → 3001.90] And...
[3001.90 → 3002.70] Nice.
[3002.76 → 3003.84] We got an answer from chat.
[3003.84 → 3006.90] Somebody said it's exactly 69 bytes.
[3007.46 → 3008.06] Shut up.
[3008.06 → 3008.38] Of cash.
[3008.98 → 3009.34] Perfect.
[3009.80 → 3010.66] It is not.
[3011.14 → 3011.54] Beautiful.
[3012.00 → 3012.64] I've had enough.
[3013.00 → 3013.68] I've had enough.
[3013.74 → 3014.92] I've had enough of your attitude.
[3015.52 → 3018.40] And I've had enough of your lies, chat.
[3018.40 → 3024.08] I heard when they announced the Intel Core 10 10420,
[3024.24 → 3028.74] that it will have exactly 469 bytes of cache.
[3028.82 → 3033.10] How much fun would it be if Intel actually had enough personality to do something like that?
[3033.10 → 3037.48] I'm not even like a pothead or whatever.
[3038.28 → 3040.32] To me, 420 is just like...
[3040.32 → 3041.12] It's just like...
[3041.12 → 3043.26] Like, it's just a meme, right?
[3043.28 → 3044.00] It's just a number.
[3044.64 → 3044.98] But like...
[3044.98 → 3045.94] That's a green spreader.
[3046.62 → 3047.70] Yeah, exactly.
[3047.92 → 3048.44] Just like...
[3048.44 → 3054.00] Having enough personality to just be like, you know, LOL, we did something.
[3054.64 → 3056.32] And there's going to be some people mad.
[3056.46 → 3057.72] But we just like issue a statement.
[3057.84 → 3060.48] Be like, yeah, you know, we're sorry you're mad.
[3060.64 → 3063.30] You know, just issue like a total non-apology for it and move on.
[3063.48 → 3072.52] Because realistically, at the end of the day, people don't buy CPUs based on like their close relationship with the values of the brand.
[3072.52 → 3075.12] And at least I don't.
[3075.88 → 3077.68] Then again, maybe some people do.
[3078.36 → 3085.38] So, you know, I can't imagine you'd lose that many customers based on just doing like a silly edition CPU once in a while.
[3086.16 → 3088.32] Then again, you know, what do I know, right?
[3088.38 → 3091.12] Like, look at all the PR disasters I've created for myself this week.
[3091.12 → 3092.24] So I'm the last person.
[3092.38 → 3094.62] I'm the last person they should put in charge of marketing.
[3094.62 → 3097.54] It would be...
[3097.54 → 3097.70] Okay.
[3097.98 → 3100.68] So the memory of the numbers aside.
[3100.88 → 3101.08] Yeah.
[3101.10 → 3105.44] It would be kind of fun if every once in a while they release like really limited runs.
[3105.70 → 3107.62] Just weird processors.
[3108.24 → 3110.26] They just can't do it.
[3110.34 → 3111.54] And I don't know why.
[3111.66 → 3113.78] Like, it's not like they don't have ideas.
[3113.78 → 3120.16] Like doing, you know, an anodized black integrated heat spreader, for example.
[3120.56 → 3122.66] It's just like the machine.
[3122.66 → 3128.32] The machine is just too big to do even 10,000 units or something.
[3128.90 → 3131.26] Imagine the extreme editions had anodized black.
[3131.56 → 3132.14] They should.
[3132.52 → 3134.60] They even have artwork.
[3134.94 → 3138.50] They even have artwork of them that kind of like look like they're darker.
[3138.92 → 3139.88] Yeah, of course they do.
[3139.94 → 3141.14] They know it would be cool.
[3141.76 → 3143.22] That would be so cool.
[3143.62 → 3147.10] Like, do you remember we did that gold-plated 8086?
[3148.36 → 3149.50] The Core i7 8086?
[3149.50 → 3150.22] Yeah.
[3151.90 → 3161.30] Dude, just imagine like anodized black with a gold-plated skull trail skull on it.
[3161.56 → 3162.30] I know, right?
[3162.74 → 3167.80] That would be the sickest looking processor ever.
[3168.30 → 3169.16] Just like...
[3169.16 → 3171.38] Oh my God.
[3171.48 → 3172.08] I know.
[3172.08 → 3176.18] Like, that's the kind of thing that I'd be like, ah, sorry, how much more is this than
[3176.18 → 3177.10] the one I...
[3177.10 → 3179.28] Like, how much am I going to lose selling my current one?
[3179.42 → 3180.56] Like, how much more does this cost?
[3180.84 → 3180.86] Yeah.
[3180.94 → 3183.48] Like, am I in it for like 70 bucks?
[3183.54 → 3184.90] Like, I'd kind of think about it.
[3187.10 → 3187.46] Yeah.
[3187.62 → 3189.54] But for whatever reason, it's hard to be cool.
[3189.78 → 3190.90] And I guess I get it.
[3192.30 → 3193.42] I just...
[3193.42 → 3195.44] Oh man, that would be so sweet.
[3195.44 → 3200.46] Like, there isn't even that much stuff that gets me like that excited with computer hardware.
[3200.46 → 3201.60] And you'll never even see it.
[3201.84 → 3202.50] Because it's like hidden.
[3203.48 → 3203.72] Yeah.
[3205.04 → 3205.96] Doesn't even matter.
[3206.06 → 3207.06] It's just so cool.
[3207.90 → 3208.40] All right.
[3208.44 → 3209.64] We've got a couple of other things.
[3209.84 → 3211.40] Vegetable Stew on the forum posted this.
[3211.58 → 3215.84] Since 2012, Apple has been attempting to automate installing micro screws for the assembly of
[3215.84 → 3216.74] iPhones and search.
[3217.14 → 3218.90] So here's a quote from the Apple engineers.
[3219.12 → 3222.40] Building a robot that can fasten screws is among the hardest challenges in the industry.
[3222.40 → 3227.48] A robot must pick up the screw at a specific angle and align it with a hole using multiple
[3227.48 → 3228.48] industrial cameras.
[3228.98 → 3233.10] Apple uses screws that are so tiny that robots had no way to measure the force used to drill
[3233.10 → 3233.52] them in.
[3233.86 → 3237.30] Whereas by contrast, human workers can feel the resistance from their hand and can tell
[3237.30 → 3238.14] when something is off.
[3238.56 → 3241.68] It might seem like getting a robot to do something as simple as install a screw should be very
[3241.68 → 3242.00] simple.
[3242.38 → 3245.72] But even just picking up a screw in the right orientation can be very difficult.
[3246.28 → 3250.36] In 2014, Apple attempted to automate the assembly of the 12-inch MacBook, but they eventually
[3250.36 → 3256.04] stopped because the 88 screws in the keyboard kept malfunctioning, leading to a delay in release
[3256.04 → 3256.80] of six months.
[3257.58 → 3259.46] So Anthony included some notes here.
[3259.86 → 3265.36] Thinking about the force required to install an M2 or an M1 screw.
[3265.52 → 3267.18] It's basically nothing and really fiddly.
[3267.86 → 3272.82] Getting the robot to tell the difference between cross-threading that or just a generous portion
[3272.82 → 3274.38] of Locate sounds almost impossible.
[3274.90 → 3276.26] So that's just a cool news item.
[3276.26 → 3279.98] I have no idea what we were supposed to say about that, Anthony, but thank you for contributing.
[3280.12 → 3282.06] Or Alex, thank you for contributing that.
[3282.62 → 3284.14] Do you want to talk about fog gaming?
[3286.46 → 3286.82] Sure.
[3287.32 → 3288.18] It's pretty fogged up.
[3288.18 → 3292.36] Cloud gaming, but when the cloud servers are close to your house.
[3292.84 → 3294.48] That actually sounds pretty cool, Luke.
[3294.50 → 3295.40] I think you're being a hater.
[3296.00 → 3296.82] But it's like...
[3296.82 → 3298.58] I think you're going to end up making an apology video.
[3299.34 → 3299.86] But there...
[3299.86 → 3304.38] Maybe I will because maybe I don't understand what's going on.
[3304.38 → 3305.86] That would be very, very fair.
[3305.98 → 3310.78] But as far as I can tell, it's basically just cloud gaming for only people in Japan.
[3312.30 → 3312.82] Yes.
[3313.62 → 3314.38] Okay, so...
[3315.16 → 3317.36] Maybe even more local than that.
[3318.00 → 3323.52] Maybe it's only people within a certain vicinity of this previous arcade.
[3323.78 → 3324.38] So what they're doing...
[3324.96 → 3325.92] It's a cool idea.
[3326.32 → 3329.30] Hopefully, because they don't have to close these down completely.
[3329.68 → 3332.54] But Sega has around 200 arcades spread across Japan.
[3332.54 → 3337.20] And they've been pretty unused due to, well, you know, COVID stuff.
[3337.50 → 3340.34] Just the reason why almost every storefront has been pretty unused.
[3340.74 → 3340.82] Yeah.
[3341.90 → 3346.56] So I've been trying to think about something to do with the servers and the PCs that they have in those centres.
[3346.82 → 3348.58] Hopefully try to monetize a little bit if they can.
[3348.82 → 3349.02] Right?
[3349.16 → 3351.20] So they came up with this whole idea of fog gaming.
[3351.34 → 3352.66] Where it's cloud gaming.
[3353.36 → 3353.78] Right?
[3353.86 → 3354.84] It's still cloud gaming.
[3354.84 → 3360.30] But these local arcades are the things that are powering it.
[3360.30 → 3363.38] So the data centre is super close, essentially.
[3363.68 → 3364.28] Because it's the arcade.
[3364.32 → 3364.46] Yeah.
[3364.54 → 3365.56] Because it's not a data centre.
[3365.68 → 3368.32] It's just, like, actually a few blocks over.
[3369.10 → 3369.24] Yeah.
[3370.66 → 3371.10] Yeah.
[3371.52 → 3373.30] I think it's super cool.
[3373.42 → 3377.02] I mean, I don't necessarily know that Sega's implementation is super exciting to me.
[3377.02 → 3378.14] I don't live in Japan.
[3378.14 → 3378.88] I don't know.
[3379.06 → 3379.22] Yeah.
[3379.34 → 3385.12] And whatever, like, games they're running, I have no idea if I would care about any of them.
[3385.60 → 3392.06] But imagining sort of a future where it almost sounds like the kind of thing that, you know,
[3392.06 → 3394.66] someone's going to try and build on the blockchain or something like that.
[3395.00 → 3403.44] Like, where you can contribute your GPU power to someone else gaming and join this, like, gaming network or something.
[3403.44 → 3410.12] Kind of like the Tesla's idea of, like, you can rent your car while you're not using it.
[3410.40 → 3410.80] Exactly.
[3411.06 → 3417.70] So it's, like, instead of, like, so NVIDIA, they've got their, like, GeForce GTX or RTX where you, like, buy the hardware.
[3417.96 → 3422.38] Then they've got their GeForce Now where you can, like, rent the hardware.
[3422.38 → 3429.90] Then they've got their, like, GeForce Everywhere where it's, like, you can kind of like an electrical grid, right?
[3429.90 → 3436.58] You could pay to use the grid, or you could contribute any excess back to the grid.
[3436.80 → 3443.76] So if you look at, like, the really cool demos that Microsoft did where they were offloading some of the processing to the cloud,
[3443.86 → 3445.96] like, back when they first launched the Xbox One X,
[3445.96 → 3456.36] it's not impossible to imagine a future where I could have, let's say, an RTX 2060, for example,
[3456.94 → 3458.98] and I could go, oh, gee, you know what?
[3458.98 → 3465.20] I really want to enjoy some game X in the highest possible fidelity,
[3465.46 → 3469.02] and my neighbours aren't using their RTX 2080s,
[3469.02 → 3474.56] and all of a sudden I can take their processing power and use it to power my game.
[3475.06 → 3479.32] I mean, probably that's completely unfeasible, but maybe one neighbour.
[3479.74 → 3481.74] As long as the connection between me and them is good,
[3481.78 → 3484.32] I could sort of have a temporary graphics card upgrade.
[3484.82 → 3486.96] And then maybe at some other time, you know,
[3487.02 → 3491.70] someone with integrated graphics on their laptop could use my RTX 2060
[3491.70 → 3494.04] for, like, a lower rate of return, right?
[3494.04 → 3497.72] So I obviously wouldn't get to loan my card out for as much,
[3497.72 → 3502.38] and then I would have to kind of pay the difference if I wanted to loan even more power to myself,
[3502.38 → 3504.04] but that would be pretty cool.
[3504.64 → 3509.44] Like, a fog gaming concept like that would not eliminate the latency problems.
[3509.56 → 3513.68] There'd still be latency, especially if you're the kind of person who's a competitive gamer.
[3514.34 → 3517.74] It's unlikely to me that we're ever going to get to the point
[3517.74 → 3522.62] where playing on anything other than local hardware is going to give you the ultimate competitive edge.
[3522.62 → 3526.30] But for just playing, like, casual games...
[3526.30 → 3530.96] It's hard to say ever, because, like, in, like, 40 years,
[3531.04 → 3532.62] who knows what's even going to be going on.
[3532.62 → 3535.20] But, like, speed of light, Luke. Speed of light, right?
[3535.90 → 3539.34] Unless they're going to put a data centre on every city block, it ain't happening.
[3540.72 → 3542.04] I mean, they could do that.
[3542.14 → 3542.94] They could do that.
[3543.12 → 3545.86] Just start putting them all underground and just everywhere.
[3546.68 → 3548.44] Nothing's impossible. You're right.
[3548.44 → 3555.66] But there's nothing you can do about physical distance other than bring the compute closer to the user.
[3556.18 → 3559.04] And this could conceivably be a way to do it.
[3560.04 → 3560.60] Yeah.
[3561.48 → 3566.82] There's at least one person in chat that's freaking out about Starlink to do with this.
[3567.22 → 3569.44] I think with Starlink...
[3570.30 → 3570.86] Starlink.
[3570.86 → 3571.38] Starlink's great.
[3571.38 → 3577.80] I'm not talking down on Starlink, but that would not be a fog style.
[3578.60 → 3582.34] If you wanted to do something like that over Starlink, whoa, for one.
[3582.74 → 3585.74] For two, you would just do traditional cloud gaming.
[3586.18 → 3587.02] For sure. Yep.
[3588.32 → 3588.56] Yep.
[3591.38 → 3593.22] Light and fibre does not move at the speed of light.
[3593.32 → 3594.86] We know. It's okay. Don't worry about it. It's fine.
[3596.18 → 3599.68] There are still practical limitations to how fast it can move.
[3599.68 → 3601.38] That's the point.
[3602.14 → 3602.94] Yep. Yep.
[3603.30 → 3604.72] Corsair recalling power supplies?
[3605.18 → 3605.40] Nah.
[3606.04 → 3606.88] That's very boring.
[3607.04 → 3608.30] Corsair recalled some power supplies.
[3608.46 → 3609.16] They had a bad batch.
[3609.94 → 3610.04] Yeah.
[3610.14 → 3611.60] I mostly just wanted to tell people.
[3611.70 → 3613.86] Yeah. It's like an SFX series one.
[3613.96 → 3615.06] You probably don't have one.
[3616.68 → 3619.86] October 2019 to March 2020, they had some bad ones.
[3622.16 → 3625.34] There's a new AIO from Thermal take that cools your CPU and RAM.
[3625.46 → 3627.28] I'm sort of afraid to look at the picture of it.
[3627.68 → 3628.26] Here we go.
[3628.56 → 3629.36] Here we go.
[3630.02 → 3630.42] Wow.
[3632.14 → 3633.98] It's just got to be a block of RGB.
[3634.28 → 3634.88] That's my...
[3634.88 → 3635.08] Yep.
[3635.74 → 3636.10] Yeah.
[3637.26 → 3637.86] Nailed it.
[3638.22 → 3639.34] Hashtag nailed it.
[3639.42 → 3640.40] Thank you, Luke, for that.
[3641.22 → 3644.44] How deep into your crystal ball did you have to look to see that one?
[3645.06 → 3647.04] It was pretty surface level, not going to lie.
[3647.04 → 3648.04] All right.
[3648.04 → 3648.16] All right.
[3648.16 → 3657.34] And then you had some thoughts on the KyleHalliday.com ray tracing in notepad post here.
[3657.46 → 3662.16] Just don't back yourself into a corner where you have to issue an apology video here.
[3662.16 → 3663.16] That's all I ask, Luke.
[3664.66 → 3665.14] It's...
[3665.14 → 3665.78] It's...
[3665.78 → 3666.46] I mean...
[3666.46 → 3668.24] It's cool.
[3668.40 → 3673.08] I think one of the notes says, Halliday's project...
[3673.08 → 3675.10] Great name for a software developer, by the way.
[3675.38 → 3679.66] Halliday's project is a great showcase of what can be achieved by combining little hacks.
[3679.66 → 3681.18] And that's...
[3681.18 → 3681.66] I mean...
[3682.86 → 3684.04] Yeah.
[3685.62 → 3686.72] It's super NATO.
[3687.08 → 3687.66] It's like...
[3687.66 → 3691.12] I don't want anyone to be like, oh my god, is there going to be games in notepad?
[3691.32 → 3692.62] He never says that.
[3693.06 → 3694.30] No one else is saying that.
[3694.78 → 3695.60] I don't want...
[3695.60 → 3696.96] Literally no one is saying that.
[3697.44 → 3698.58] No one is saying...
[3698.58 → 3700.78] It's a really cool little hacky project.
[3701.18 → 3702.36] I like things like this.
[3702.60 → 3703.12] They're fun.
[3703.12 → 3704.12] Um...
[3705.80 → 3707.92] He built like a snake game with it.
[3708.10 → 3708.68] That's neat.
[3709.00 → 3709.56] It's pretty cool.
[3710.72 → 3711.16] It's...
[3711.16 → 3712.04] It's like...
[3712.04 → 3712.36] Yeah.
[3713.02 → 3713.46] I...
[3713.46 → 3714.94] This kind of stuff is cool.
[3715.50 → 3716.46] Um...
[3716.46 → 3717.12] But...
[3717.12 → 3717.34] Yeah.
[3717.70 → 3717.98] I...
[3717.98 → 3719.12] Just like someone's like...
[3719.70 → 3720.46] Fog Gaming?
[3720.78 → 3721.12] And Starlink?
[3722.22 → 3722.78] I just...
[3722.78 → 3723.14] You know...
[3723.14 → 3724.94] Don't jump too far with it.
[3727.52 → 3729.74] It's a very adorable snake game, though.
[3730.80 → 3731.08] Yeah.
[3733.12 → 3735.52] I kind of love it.
[3738.76 → 3739.28] Yeah.
[3740.26 → 3740.78] Wow.
[3740.84 → 3746.80] With the line spacing, you really run into trouble with the...
[3746.80 → 3752.50] With the speed of the snake when you're going up and down versus side to side.
[3752.68 → 3752.84] Yeah.
[3753.34 → 3753.52] Yeah.
[3754.38 → 3756.56] I mean, he never said the gameplay was great.
[3757.94 → 3758.46] No.
[3758.64 → 3758.90] No.
[3759.06 → 3759.24] No.
[3759.42 → 3759.60] No.
[3759.94 → 3760.94] But it is cool.
[3761.20 → 3761.96] That's pretty cool.
[3761.96 → 3763.78] It's fascinating how he got there.
[3764.96 → 3765.44] Um...
[3765.44 → 3766.66] It's...
[3766.66 → 3766.80] Yeah.
[3766.86 → 3768.18] This kind of stuff is really fun.
[3768.28 → 3769.68] This is a really cool way to get into...
[3770.48 → 3771.40] If you...
[3771.40 → 3775.40] If this looks interesting to you, this is a really cool way to get into software development
[3775.40 → 3780.38] and learning how to, like, be hacky with things in cool, productive ways.
[3781.04 → 3783.68] Well, not necessarily super productive in this case, but...
[3784.68 → 3785.30] And cool.
[3785.30 → 3786.78] It all depends on how you've defined cool.
[3788.54 → 3789.34] Also that.
[3789.58 → 3790.58] But I think it's cool.
[3790.58 → 3791.78] Like, I probably wouldn't...
[3791.78 → 3797.92] I probably wouldn't whip out my blog at, like, the bar to...
[3797.92 → 3799.04] Depends on which bar.
[3800.14 → 3800.62] Yeah.
[3800.96 → 3804.42] Honestly, this snake game could go really far in the right bar.
[3806.08 → 3807.32] Says someone who is...
[3807.32 → 3807.50] Really?
[3808.30 → 3810.08] A very large amount of time in bars.
[3810.20 → 3810.46] Yeah.
[3810.62 → 3814.74] I know for a fact that you know very little about how bars work.
[3815.06 → 3818.68] Then again, I know very little about how bars work, too.
[3819.30 → 3821.62] I know you've got to pass one if you want to be a lawyer.
[3822.90 → 3823.76] I've got that.
[3823.88 → 3827.56] I know that you've got to do it again if you want to reinforce concrete.
[3827.56 → 3828.56] Um...
[3829.74 → 3830.12] Okay.
[3830.40 → 3830.62] Yeah.
[3830.98 → 3831.30] Rebar.
[3831.94 → 3832.16] Yeah.
[3832.28 → 3832.96] No, that was good.
[3833.32 → 3833.72] That was good.
[3834.58 → 3835.72] I, uh...
[3835.72 → 3839.50] Yeah, I assume there are bars in Silicon Valley where if you whipped out your snake game and
[3839.50 → 3840.70] notepad, you'd have a crowd.
[3840.86 → 3841.96] Like, almost immediately.
[3842.28 → 3842.68] Okay.
[3842.86 → 3843.28] All right.
[3844.96 → 3845.86] And on that note...
[3845.86 → 3846.40] The right bar.
[3846.60 → 3847.42] I think this would...
[3847.42 → 3849.06] This would do great.
[3849.28 → 3849.72] Yeah.
[3850.16 → 3851.50] So there you guys have it.
[3851.50 → 3854.64] Luke's pickup tips here on the WAN show.
[3855.42 → 3856.26] Try them out.
[3856.42 → 3856.90] Try them out.
[3856.90 → 3859.58] It could work if you find the right person.
[3859.70 → 3860.50] It could work.
[3860.62 → 3860.94] All right.
[3861.22 → 3862.64] Uh, let's do a couple super chats.
[3862.96 → 3866.58] Yalu G says, I think I played a significant role in the recent Twitter drama and wanted
[3866.58 → 3867.08] to apologize.
[3867.22 → 3867.38] Oh.
[3867.74 → 3868.04] No, no.
[3868.08 → 3868.44] Don't worry.
[3868.50 → 3868.86] You're good.
[3868.96 → 3869.38] You're good.
[3869.46 → 3870.04] It's all good.
[3870.58 → 3873.66] When they lose the snake game, it could print on screen.
[3874.14 → 3877.46] Like, you lost the game, but you could win a date with me.
[3878.38 → 3879.60] Oh, Lord.
[3879.60 → 3880.60] Oh, Lord.
[3880.60 → 3890.28] Oh, man.
[3893.56 → 3894.00] Terrible.
[3894.92 → 3896.68] It's funny because I made it worse.
[3897.06 → 3898.58] I reduced your chances.
[3899.34 → 3900.36] Don't do that part.
[3900.60 → 3901.42] Do the first part, though.
[3901.42 → 3904.58] Oh, this is kind of crazy.
[3905.22 → 3909.74] The Internet Archive is being sued.
[3911.10 → 3911.40] What?
[3911.64 → 3912.04] By whom?
[3912.04 → 3914.46] Um, okay.
[3914.54 → 3918.54] When Internet Archive announced it was creating a national emergency library, temporarily
[3918.54 → 3922.12] suspending waitlists to borrow e-books amid a pandemic, a crowd of writers and publishers
[3922.12 → 3923.04] made their...
[3923.76 → 3928.86] If you do, either of us, please film it and show me.
[3929.02 → 3929.24] Okay.
[3929.28 → 3933.02] I don't know enough about this to comment on it yet, but thank you for your super chat.
[3933.02 → 3935.28] I will try and have a look at it later.
[3935.28 → 3938.22] Um, thanks, Metal Gappy.
[3938.90 → 3940.58] Uh, thanks, Jared Faraday.
[3941.54 → 3945.16] Um, Chris McKenzie says, great value, super chat.
[3946.74 → 3948.10] I, yeah, it's up to you.
[3948.16 → 3949.36] I mean, I guess it was two bucks.
[3949.56 → 3951.18] He didn't really invest much, so there's that.
[3951.62 → 3954.84] Uh, Robert Mail says, won't be able to watch live this month.
[3954.94 → 3957.24] Pretend this super chat is something topic relevant.
[3958.28 → 3960.78] Also, MC.LTT.GG.
[3960.98 → 3961.66] Thanks, Robert.
[3961.66 → 3965.90] Robert literally pays me to promote my own Minecraft server.
[3966.62 → 3969.78] He seems to be very confused about how this works, but that's okay.
[3969.84 → 3970.34] It's adorable.
[3971.04 → 3975.80] Um, Adela says, two bones for Linus's beard levelling up.
[3975.94 → 3976.50] Thank you.
[3977.10 → 3977.94] Uh, James.
[3978.42 → 3982.50] Hey, Linus, I spend a decent amount of money on supers to ask questions that often don't
[3982.50 → 3983.10] get answered.
[3983.76 → 3985.30] Wow, you really wasted this one.
[3985.64 → 3986.16] No, just kidding.
[3986.20 → 3987.02] There's a question in here.
[3987.16 → 3990.82] Would you consider doing videos or streams dedicated to responding to missed supers?
[3990.82 → 3992.32] Oh, oh, wow.
[3992.38 → 3993.54] No, you really did waste it.
[3993.64 → 3994.32] Wow, what a bummer.
[3994.40 → 3998.30] I really, I saw it this time and, uh, the answer's no, I'm afraid.
[3998.46 → 3999.00] Oh, crap.
[3999.10 → 3999.74] This is awkward.
[4000.26 → 4008.06] Um, yeah, no, I mean, uh, I do stream, uh, games like, uh, like Beat Safer and stuff.
[4008.14 → 4011.16] And if people ask me questions during those, I like try to answer them.
[4011.16 → 4017.38] Um, and it tends to be a much smaller crowd because WAN shows like between 10 and 15,000
[4017.38 → 4018.22] viewers typically.
[4018.54 → 4020.02] So chat moves too fast.
[4020.10 → 4021.86] Like even the super chat moves too fast sometimes.
[4022.06 → 4026.00] Uh, whereas those streams get like hundreds of viewers by comparison.
[4026.00 → 4033.42] Um, Impulse Mist says, I recently started watching your vids because I'm going to buy and build
[4033.42 → 4033.98] my own.
[4034.48 → 4035.22] Any tips?
[4036.46 → 4037.90] Um, watch more vids.
[4038.02 → 4038.92] Watch more vids.
[4039.24 → 4039.64] Yeah.
[4040.56 → 4040.90] Woo.
[4041.48 → 4042.50] And save your money.
[4042.66 → 4047.50] Buy a better PC instead of sending super chats to, um, ungrateful YouTubers.
[4048.44 → 4049.22] There you go.
[4049.32 → 4050.34] That's a free tech tip.
[4050.34 → 4055.08] I, I have, it's like, I haven't had enough shooting myself in the foot for one week.
[4055.18 → 4056.98] You know, I got to keep going.
[4057.72 → 4064.90] That if you send more super chats in higher values, your computer goes faster.
[4065.06 → 4065.74] Did you hear that?
[4065.98 → 4066.72] Who'd you hear that from?
[4067.50 → 4074.72] The sending of the super chat alleviates some of the weight on the RAM subsystem of your computer.
[4074.76 → 4075.02] Uh-huh.
[4075.10 → 4075.38] Yeah.
[4075.68 → 4076.52] Who'd you hear that from?
[4076.54 → 4078.34] Giving you more RAM.
[4078.90 → 4080.24] Uh, don't listen to Lyle.
[4080.34 → 4080.84] He lies.
[4081.24 → 4083.68] You've all heard that downloading RAM doesn't work.
[4084.36 → 4086.90] Uploading RAM, however, highly effective.
[4087.26 → 4087.40] Yeah.
[4087.50 → 4093.50] So the harder you get rammed by wasting your money on someone's super chats, the more RAM
[4093.50 → 4094.02] you have.
[4094.68 → 4094.94] Yeah.
[4095.68 → 4097.24] That's, that's pretty graphic.
[4097.40 → 4097.68] All right.
[4098.06 → 4101.06] Uh, Tommy Gunn says, can you do a build in your old TJ07?
[4101.36 → 4102.08] Loved that case.
[4102.14 → 4103.08] No one using it anymore.
[4103.54 → 4104.72] That would be pretty fun.
[4104.72 → 4109.70] Um, it's actually, it's actually right behind me, uh, under this pile of stuff.
[4109.70 → 4109.96] Yeah.
[4109.98 → 4111.44] You guys can kind of see the pile back there.
[4111.86 → 4113.84] Um, but probably not anytime soon.
[4115.08 → 4115.82] All right.
[4116.24 → 4119.50] Uh, Robert says, my RAM shows 16 gigs, eight usable.
[4121.36 → 4122.78] Do you think it's a bad CPU?
[4123.92 → 4125.24] Man, that's weird.
[4125.24 → 4129.40] I feel like I've seen that before, but I don't remember where.
[4129.40 → 4133.54] If you're using onboard memory, I still, I don't think an onboard GPU is going to even
[4133.54 → 4136.50] allow you to allocate like eight gigs to it.
[4137.34 → 4138.02] Am I wrong?
[4138.30 → 4138.92] Is that possible?
[4140.60 → 4144.54] Actually, can you, can you allocate eight gigs of RAM to your onboard memory or to your,
[4144.62 → 4145.68] to your, uh, onboard GPU?
[4145.68 → 4148.24] I have no idea.
[4148.40 → 4149.44] I can't, uh, you know what?
[4149.46 → 4151.92] I'm sure someone else in the post it on the forum.
[4152.04 → 4153.44] You got to post it on Linus Tech Tips forum.
[4154.56 → 4155.80] Uh, thanks, Mike Adams.
[4156.28 → 4156.58] All right.
[4156.60 → 4157.84] Just going to do a couple more here.
[4158.50 → 4162.02] Uh, Hugh Holmes asks, can an LT t-shirt save my marriage?
[4162.48 → 4167.34] The best way to save your marriage, Hugh, is to stop wasting your money on super chats
[4167.34 → 4169.62] and spend them on your wife or husband.
[4170.74 → 4172.04] You won't know until you try it.
[4172.10 → 4175.54] Luke, did you just say you won't know until you try if super chats are going to save your marriage?
[4175.68 → 4176.82] Or the LT t-shirt?
[4177.62 → 4178.32] Both, really?
[4178.72 → 4179.60] LTTstore.com.
[4180.42 → 4182.96] Here I, here I am trying to give people good advice, Luke.
[4183.06 → 4184.18] I'm trying to give people good advice.
[4184.30 → 4184.64] I'm trying to.
[4185.14 → 4191.88] But if they appeal to said marriage partner through a super chat and that marriage partner
[4191.88 → 4197.94] watches the WAN show, and then you say it, that could be interpreted as a romantic gesture.
[4198.36 → 4200.70] But then what if I got it wrong?
[4200.86 → 4201.06] Okay.
[4201.10 → 4203.74] So what if, so what if someone sends me a super chat, right?
[4203.74 → 4207.78] To get me to shout out their wife or their husband to try to save their marriage.
[4207.92 → 4211.16] And then inadvertently I say, I shout it out.
[4211.22 → 4212.72] I'm like, yeah, this is a good marriage.
[4212.72 → 4213.54] It's worth saving.
[4213.68 → 4217.58] And then, and then it ends up being a bad marriage and not worth saving.
[4217.58 → 4219.80] And then I have to do an apology video again.
[4222.38 → 4226.10] What if the marriage, what if they were better off having never met each other, Luke?
[4226.46 → 4227.10] Then what?
[4228.00 → 4231.40] That's just, that's just how the cookie sometimes crumbles, you know?
[4232.68 → 4234.54] I just got to make apology videos.
[4234.54 → 4235.58] All right.
[4235.64 → 4240.28] Thanks, Ancient Moros and Steven Rodriguez, who demands that Zones come back.
[4240.88 → 4241.52] Good luck with that.
[4241.54 → 4241.98] Oh my goodness.
[4242.68 → 4245.50] That would be, I mean, in today's day and age, horrible.
[4245.94 → 4248.20] But back then, I actually really liked June.
[4248.62 → 4250.40] I never had any money, so I didn't buy one.
[4250.52 → 4252.84] But I really liked the software that I used anyway.
[4253.72 → 4254.66] Theories, don't worry.
[4254.72 → 4255.30] It's all good.
[4255.36 → 4257.90] I don't actually have a neighbour that dumps grass over my fence.
[4257.98 → 4258.36] It's chill.
[4258.36 → 4264.86] So, MGS Bacon says, I applied for the ME position on the site and was wondering what
[4264.86 → 4266.68] made you guys want to get more into product dev.
[4266.74 → 4268.16] Hope my resume catches an eye or two.
[4269.18 → 4274.66] I just have a bunch of ideas for stuff that I think we could make for LTTstore.com that
[4274.66 → 4278.38] require a mechanical engineer who actually has time to work on mechanical engineering.
[4279.30 → 4282.94] Alex has done a great job on some of the projects that he's working on right now, but
[4282.94 → 4285.50] he just also needs to, like, be a writer.
[4287.18 → 4288.20] So, that's why.
[4288.36 → 4288.72] That's why.
[4288.96 → 4292.32] We've got some stuff that we feel like needs to be made, and there's no one here to make
[4292.32 → 4293.94] it, so we're going to hire someone to make it.
[4294.34 → 4295.08] That's how you do it.
[4296.42 → 4298.82] Milky Moth says, this is my first time watching The WAN Show.
[4298.94 → 4299.64] Love your content.
[4299.76 → 4300.54] Wanted to show some support.
[4300.68 → 4302.48] Well, thank you very much.
[4302.92 → 4303.74] Appreciate it.
[4304.26 → 4309.48] And Raphael says, do a video about everyone's MBTI and Big Five personality types, please.
[4310.14 → 4311.64] What is an MBTI?
[4312.50 → 4315.40] I hope I haven't, like, oh, man.
[4315.40 → 4318.62] I hope I haven't said something that's just, like, horrible or something.
[4319.36 → 4320.22] It's, yeah.
[4320.36 → 4320.90] Oh, oh.
[4321.26 → 4321.94] Myer Briggs thing.
[4321.94 → 4322.70] It's your personality breakdown thing.
[4322.96 → 4323.16] Yeah.
[4323.16 → 4323.26] Yeah.
[4325.48 → 4327.80] I'm whatever the like, angry short one is.
[4330.62 → 4331.42] Little dog.
[4331.50 → 4332.30] Little dog syndrome.
[4332.46 → 4333.66] Which one's little dog syndrome?
[4334.26 → 4337.40] We did this at Float plane a while back.
[4337.54 → 4338.06] Did you really?
[4338.86 → 4339.14] Yeah.
[4339.52 → 4340.48] Oh, that's kind of cool.
[4340.56 → 4341.84] It wasn't even my idea.
[4342.66 → 4345.00] AJ, I'm pretty sure AJ came up with it.
[4345.64 → 4346.02] But, yeah.
[4346.32 → 4349.26] Most of them, I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
[4349.26 → 4352.84] Like, there wasn't any that really were all that surprising.
[4353.30 → 4353.62] All right.
[4353.70 → 4354.56] Why don't you do me?
[4356.46 → 4357.10] That came up right.
[4357.12 → 4357.94] Oh, I don't remember.
[4359.62 → 4360.14] Anytime.
[4361.16 → 4362.48] Well, I've got it up on the screen.
[4364.10 → 4364.38] What?
[4365.52 → 4369.22] You got to use the questions on the outside of the chart to determine the four letters.
[4370.78 → 4371.18] Okay.
[4371.56 → 4372.16] Analyze me.
[4372.84 → 4374.48] You put the anal in analyze.
[4374.60 → 4375.22] I know you do.
[4375.22 → 4375.32] Okay.
[4379.26 → 4380.80] Is he muted?
[4381.06 → 4382.24] E for sure.
[4383.26 → 4383.60] Okay.
[4383.70 → 4385.82] So, I'm extroversion.
[4386.98 → 4388.92] You wouldn't describe me as private, though?
[4390.58 → 4390.94] No.
[4391.64 → 4392.76] So, well, okay.
[4393.00 → 4393.34] Yeah.
[4393.58 → 4396.58] But if I have to pick one or the other, you're definitely E.
[4396.80 → 4400.44] And in this case, the E is like font size 72.
[4401.14 → 4405.46] And the next three letters are going to be like normal, like font size 18.
[4405.86 → 4408.72] Like there's just this giant thing E at the beginning.
[4409.26 → 4409.70] Dang.
[4410.42 → 4411.88] And then it goes on to the rest of it.
[4413.14 → 4418.50] It's like the Multiplier E meme comes back and just places an E right at the beginning of your head.
[4418.50 → 4418.74] All right.
[4418.78 → 4422.04] So, I'm definitely ending up on the bottom of the chart here.
[4422.22 → 4425.50] That's a strong start here.
[4425.58 → 4426.16] Strong start.
[4427.70 → 4428.72] Oh, you cut back.
[4428.76 → 4429.54] I can't see it now.
[4429.66 → 4430.40] Oh, I'm sorry.
[4430.46 → 4431.76] You were actually using my thing.
[4431.84 → 4432.48] Oh, it's just on Wikipedia.
[4432.74 → 4432.98] But yeah.
[4433.10 → 4433.30] Okay.
[4433.90 → 4434.30] All right.
[4434.32 → 4434.78] I'll leave it up.
[4434.88 → 4435.34] I'll leave it up.
[4435.96 → 4436.28] Okay.
[4436.32 → 4436.76] I found it.
[4437.48 → 4437.84] Hold on.
[4437.98 → 4438.16] Okay.
[4438.16 → 4438.76] I'll take it down.
[4440.52 → 4440.98] All right.
[4440.98 → 4441.36] It's down.
[4441.42 → 4441.78] It's down.
[4441.88 → 4442.32] We're all good.
[4442.38 → 4442.80] We're all good.
[4443.02 → 4443.66] We got this.
[4444.62 → 4444.94] Okay.
[4444.94 → 4451.94] The next one is...
[4453.56 → 4455.64] I could see it going...
[4455.64 → 4455.80] Yeah.
[4455.90 → 4456.48] This is what I'm saying.
[4456.64 → 4458.70] These are more like font size 18.
[4458.96 → 4460.86] This one I could kind of see going either way.
[4461.42 → 4466.30] I have experienced you acting in both ways separately.
[4466.30 → 4472.42] I think I would go with S.
[4473.08 → 4474.00] I'm sensing.
[4474.36 → 4476.40] Pay attention to concrete facts and details.
[4477.28 → 4482.22] Don't run your mouth and have to make an apology video because you were a jerk.
[4482.84 → 4483.70] No, that's not in there.
[4483.74 → 4484.48] That doesn't seem right.
[4484.88 → 4486.90] I prefer ideas that have practical applications.
[4487.06 → 4487.16] Okay.
[4487.16 → 4490.76] I definitely prefer practical applications, but I also like stuff for their own sake.
[4491.08 → 4491.66] I don't know.
[4492.14 → 4492.66] I give up.
[4492.66 → 4494.58] I could see you very much going either way on that.
[4494.78 → 4495.18] I don't know.
[4495.28 → 4497.48] I think the rest of them are all going to kind of be flexible.
[4497.68 → 4499.76] I was trying to figure you out at the same time.
[4499.92 → 4509.30] And honestly, looking at even extroversion versus introversion, there are times when you
[4509.30 → 4514.50] could totally be described as talkative and outgoing, but then also I'd probably lean you
[4514.50 → 4517.20] more towards the eye side, but it's just not that simple.
[4518.20 → 4518.64] Yeah.
[4519.20 → 4519.40] Yeah.
[4519.52 → 4521.52] I think that's what a lot of this ultimately is.
[4521.52 → 4526.32] And for me, when I do this, he and I tend to flip depending on like when I take the
[4526.32 → 4526.64] test.
[4526.78 → 4526.94] Yeah.
[4527.06 → 4528.00] Oh yeah, totally.
[4528.08 → 4533.12] And even things like thinking versus feeling like you definitely enjoy finding flaws in
[4533.12 → 4533.54] an argument.
[4534.40 → 4536.40] He likes finding flaws in arguments.
[4538.82 → 4541.72] And you could be described as reasonable and level-headed.
[4542.86 → 4547.08] But I would also say you are warm and empathetic, and you value harmony and forgiveness.
[4547.08 → 4548.60] So it's like, it's tough, right?
[4548.60 → 4549.60] Yeah.
[4550.26 → 4550.62] Yeah.
[4550.62 → 4556.72] I think, I think it's, it's too dependent on the scenario and people, people, you know,
[4556.78 → 4558.74] people kind of flow like water sometimes.
[4558.74 → 4560.76] And you have to, yeah, I don't know.
[4560.92 → 4566.34] You have to just hold out your hands and catch them, you know, and drink them up.
[4568.74 → 4569.72] What you have to do.
[4570.76 → 4571.76] It's a tough job.
[4571.86 → 4572.80] Someone's got to do it.
[4572.80 → 4577.18] Some of the quotes from this show are going to be ridiculous.
[4578.48 → 4579.20] All right.
[4579.52 → 4582.98] Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
[4583.60 → 4584.30] Oh, hold on.
[4584.38 → 4587.12] Got one more, one more super chat here.
[4587.46 → 4590.26] Jack says, my girlfriend is brand new to PC gaming.
[4590.36 → 4590.86] Thanks to you.
[4590.92 → 4592.58] Do you have a game recommendation for her?
[4593.44 → 4594.52] Thanks for all you do.
[4594.62 → 4594.86] Also.
[4594.96 → 4595.40] Hey, Luke.
[4595.82 → 4596.18] All right.
[4596.44 → 4598.10] So Luke, what's your game recommendation?
[4599.92 → 4600.86] Breath of the Wild.
[4600.86 → 4602.04] Yeah.
[4602.92 → 4603.28] Yep.
[4604.44 → 4605.92] That was a waste of 20 bucks, Jack.
[4607.42 → 4608.14] Animal Crossing.
[4608.32 → 4609.90] Everyone on the planet seems to like that game.
[4609.98 → 4610.20] No, no.
[4610.24 → 4610.88] He asked for a PC.
[4610.88 → 4612.54] He asked for a PC game recommendation.
[4612.72 → 4613.54] That's why I'm messing with.
[4616.34 → 4619.66] I mean, you can play probably both of those games on PC.
[4619.78 → 4621.92] You can definitely play Breath of the Wild on PC.
[4622.12 → 4623.00] That's true.
[4623.50 → 4623.90] Definitely.
[4624.62 → 4630.12] Buy a copy of it that you then like bury in your backyard or whatever.
[4630.12 → 4630.76] But.
[4633.34 → 4633.96] All right.
[4634.06 → 4635.40] I hope you guys enjoyed the show.
[4635.50 → 4636.54] We'll see you again next week.
[4636.68 → 4637.30] Same bad time.
[4637.42 → 4638.20] Same bad channel.
[4638.88 → 4639.24] Bye.
[4642.00 → 4642.80] Where's the thing?
[4642.90 → 4643.56] Hold on a second.
[4644.48 → 4645.22] There it is.
[4646.22 → 4646.70] All right.
[4646.72 → 4647.50] Rolling that intro.
[4647.80 → 4648.14] Outro.
[4648.28 → 4648.86] Whatever it is.
[4650.48 → 4651.50] Raphael's super chat.
[4651.66 → 4651.96] Solent.
[4652.08 → 4652.72] Drink people.
[4653.50 → 4653.64] Yeah.
[4653.76 → 4653.96] Well.
[4656.30 → 4657.28] Only Solent green.
[4657.28 → 4660.88] The Solent thing that like you can buy now is not people as far as I know.
[4661.90 → 4666.26] Although if I might say that, and it turns out to be people, I'd have to make another apology video.
[4667.52 → 4668.50] I would suck.
[4669.92 → 4670.72] It was like.
[4671.04 → 4671.62] Oh, man.
[4671.62 → 4680.58] I like felt like I was walking into like a court hearing or something like walking down to set to shoot that.
[4680.70 → 4682.38] I really didn't want to do it.
[4682.62 → 4682.82] It wasn't.
[4683.00 → 4683.94] It was a good video.
[4684.04 → 4684.78] Well, no, but I wanted.
[4685.04 → 4686.20] I wanted to do it.
[4686.46 → 4688.62] Like I wouldn't have written it if I didn't want to do it.
[4688.62 → 4690.88] But I really was uncomfortable doing it.
[4691.40 → 4691.60] Anyway.
[4691.74 → 4692.04] All right.
[4692.46 → 4693.48] I got to end the show.
[4693.64 → 4693.88] Sorry.
[4694.20 → 4694.60] Bye, guys.
[4694.74 → 4694.84] Bye.
[4694.84 → 4695.02] Bye.
[4695.02 → 4695.04] Bye.
[4695.04 → 4695.12] Bye.
[4695.12 → 4695.14] Bye.
[4695.14 → 4695.16] Bye.
[4695.16 → 4695.18] Bye.
[4695.18 → 4695.20] Bye.
[4695.20 → 4695.24] Bye.
[4695.24 → 4695.26] Bye.
[4695.26 → 4695.28] Bye.
[4695.28 → 4695.80] Bye.
[4695.80 → 4696.24] Bye.
[4696.24 → 4697.18] Bye.
[4697.18 → 4697.24] Bye.
[4697.24 → 4697.28] Bye.
