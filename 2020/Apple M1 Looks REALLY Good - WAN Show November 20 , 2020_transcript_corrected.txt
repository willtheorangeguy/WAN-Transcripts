[0.00 → 6.32] okay good looks like I was reading so it's like if I'm not picked up on something
[9.92 → 19.20] and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen the only show where we talk tech news uh maybe i
[19.20 → 25.44] don't know 15 20 of the time even though it's allegedly a tech news show yeah I mean if you
[25.44 → 29.60] really wanted tech news you would go watch tech linked anyway I mean this guy he doesn't even work
[29.60 → 42.08] and like review tech media anymore how he's always on here chilling his plan flow we've got a great
[42.08 → 49.52] show for you guys today the Apple Silicon m1 reviews are coming out, and it looks pretty good yeah which
[49.52 → 56.48] is the exact opposite of what I said apparently yeah you've you flamed it pretty hard you said it
[56.48 → 61.84] was guaranteed to be terrible you said the whole architecture from the ground up was just garbage
[61.84 → 67.20] I did say that didn't I there it's a really inflammatory video could you uh could you get me
[67.20 → 71.28] the time stamps for where I said that in the video please while I go through the rest of the
[71.28 → 82.16] the great topics we're going to have today uh uh oh oh now we've got a problem uh AMD's Radeon RX 6800 series has launched
[82.16 → 90.08] the game on the game and the game is a great game and the game is a great game and the game is
[90.08 → 95.92] sort of let's talk about that talk about that in a bit what else we got apple drops app store fees
[95.92 → 102.64] sort of um we'll also talk about that a bit later we've got a lot of sorts of don't we and that one
[102.64 → 112.08] affects Luke personally it does, and now it's personal yeah dunk dunk dunk also no one is safe YouTube is
[112.08 → 119.20] adding more ads including to channels that are not able to turn on monetization uh, and we'll talk more
[119.20 → 128.16] about how that works later on dang it is my fill rates going to go down well this sucks gosh darn it
[128.16 → 132.64] YouTube now I'm so mad that I could just I could just roll the intro
[136.08 → 141.52] so the filler rates are less important than if you couldn't roll the intro you know
[141.52 → 148.56] I'm confused there are settings in here on YouTube I actually forgot to enable live chat, but it's
[148.56 → 154.56] definitely enabled and I did remember to enable slow mode, but that does not appear to be enabled
[155.20 → 164.96] so I don't YouTube flash perfect yeah I don't really know how that works, but that's okay because
[164.96 → 171.28] it doesn't matter anymore let's go ahead and kick off with our first topic today this was posted by random
[172.00 → 178.40] kid no random kid on the forums reviews are beginning to trickle in about the
[178.40 → 184.88] new macs based on apple's m1 SOC and so far the verdict even among those who weren't given advanced
[184.88 → 191.36] samples is pretty positive the common factor all reviewers are talking about is just how cool the
[191.36 → 196.96] chips run Anthony came to me actually within probably about an hour and a half of getting his hands on with
[196.96 → 203.04] the Mac mini, and he's like the fan doesn't turn on and I was like wow that's pretty cool
[208.32 → 214.32] while the MacBook Air does thermal throttle it is apparently not a significant hindrance um that's
[214.32 → 219.44] something that Anthony has definitely been working on as well unfortunately some of the tools that we rely
[219.44 → 226.80] on for measuring things like um CPU power states and clock speeds and all that kind of stuff um don't
[226.80 → 232.88] exist because some of them are intel specific tools that run specifically on intel processors and unlike on
[232.88 → 240.80] the pc where there's sort of like you know diagnostic utilities for absolute days many of which are
[240.80 → 247.92] community supported or open source uh on the mac there's not a lot so when something really
[247.92 → 253.12] fundamental changes like this it can take a little bit of time for uh well for anything to kind of
[253.12 → 258.56] come out that allows you to dig into it uh fortunately though you can measure performance at the very
[258.56 → 264.48] least we do have a thermal camera, so there are definitely things that we can do and so far it's looking
[264.48 → 270.16] pretty good the Mac mini and MacBook Pro rarely if ever even have to ramp up their fans in order to reach
[270.16 → 274.56] maximum performance and don't seem to suffer from any thermal throttling that was actually something that
[274.56 → 279.76] if I recall correctly I speculated but since everything that I say about max is automatically
[279.76 → 284.80] wrong I don't think I'll be getting any credit for that I think what I said was perhaps the difference
[284.80 → 291.04] between the mac uh the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro is in terms of performance is not necessarily
[291.04 → 295.20] going to be you know core configuration or clock speeds or anything like that but rather just cooling
[295.20 → 300.48] solution and then just allowing it to throttle if you're doing something that's a like an extended load
[300.48 → 306.96] um and on tack shows the m1 outperforming intel's tiger lake mobile processors which are their latest
[306.96 → 313.44] and says that the m1 in its maximum performance design with a small fan is quoted unquote astoundingly
[313.44 → 319.20] good with software support on day one looking good due to Rosetta 2 I was really impressed with Rosetta
[319.20 → 327.52] 2's ability to just take obs which it is amazing the kind of criticism that I faced over that video it was like
[327.52 → 333.76] people were like what kind of benchmark is obs is a benchmark of here's a random utility that's
[333.76 → 342.96] pretty a lot of people yeahs does not have a native uh that does not have a native version for m1 and
[342.96 → 349.28] I'm gonna just install it and see what happens and I'm going to like screen capture and like encode video
[349.28 → 356.00] and it's a very industry it's its definitely niche, but it is a very industry tool it is used by almost
[356.00 → 361.68] everyone that does things that obs could be used for so it's like um what kind of benchmark is
[361.68 → 369.76] that I don't know uh like interesting one uh so Rosetta 2 for those not familiar is apple's x86
[369.76 → 375.44] emulation layer that allows Apple Silicon max to run software that has not yet been optimized for the
[375.44 → 381.68] new hardware now typically this incurs a massive performance penalty so if you look at something like
[381.68 → 389.52] uh you know emulation you know even emulating a game cube game you need a pc that is many times
[389.52 → 396.72] more powerful than a game cube to play like spider-man or whatever so clearly what apple's doing is not
[397.68 → 403.60] emulation in a traditional sense uh what they're doing is what is it on the fly like binary translation
[403.60 → 411.44] or something like that I forget what the actual term is um i, but it's if I recall correctly
[411.44 → 418.64] it's like a type of emulation um but what's fascinating is it seems like they have some kind of
[418.64 → 424.48] hardware acceleration for it so let me see if I can find uh the source for this
[425.28 → 430.88] dun dun dun dun dun due to the memory model mismatch you have to uh straight up implemented the x86
[430.88 → 435.20] consistency model on their cores that's kind of high and big detail that emulation performance for a
[435.20 → 441.36] different architecture that's really freaking cool so they actually baked in um features that are going
[441.36 → 447.92] to make it way better at emulating x86, so other arm devices would have to fully translate load store
[447.92 → 454.56] commands translation yeah from x86 to arm compatible functions due to a memory model mismatch but m1 is able
[454.56 → 460.72] to do it without this extra translation step so while we might expect to see like a fraction literally
[460.72 → 467.68] a fraction you know one fifth one tenth of the performance uh with traditional emulation here
[467.68 → 476.00] we're seeing anywhere from as high as like 80 plus percent of the native performance and I think uh I'm
[476.00 → 480.64] going from memory here so unfortunately I might be wrong but I think it's somewhere in the neighbourhood
[480.64 → 488.88] of like 50 to 55 like the 50 to 60 percent range which is pretty darn impressive um
[488.88 → 495.28] um that means that makes apple m1 the only arm SOC that's capable of emulating x86 so efficiently at
[495.28 → 501.52] this time as good as Rosetta 2 is recorded to be though uh obviously universal binary 2 is apple's
[501.52 → 506.88] preferred method which will allow you to go on the app store and regardless of what kind of mac you have
[506.88 → 513.12] you have an x86 mac you've got an arm mac doesn't matter you just get the app, and it runs natively on your
[513.12 → 517.84] machine um so far developers have been releasing updated versions of their software at a steady pace
[517.84 → 524.72] uh Google Chrome um well it went out and then there was a problem so they pulled it, but now it's back
[524.72 → 530.40] as my understanding unless it's been pulled again uh and there's a beta version of handbrake that um
[530.40 → 535.60] is along with Google Chrome among the early releases a new version of pixel mater includes support for the
[535.60 → 541.60] neural engine to perform some pretty incredible upscaling check this out, so this is posted by Anthony
[541.60 → 550.00] dumas over on Twitter hey there it is look at that left is pixel mater machine learning upscale right is
[550.00 → 558.24] standard bilinear from a 121 by 180 image that's pretty cool you can see it there's a much sharper
[558.80 → 565.44] yeah much better looking gradient way sharper lines this text looks perfect actually
[565.44 → 572.48] wow that's pretty that is pretty cool now obviously it's not perfect I've probably got
[572.48 → 578.72] people being like oh yeah look at this it's horrible uh and in some places this really does end up looking
[578.72 → 583.76] better like the way the shadow under his belly kind of meets up in his armpit here same with the
[583.76 → 590.16] shadow under the armpit, but the difference is that this with a little bit of cleanup is going to look
[590.16 → 595.28] better than this with a lot of cleanups that's the difference neither of them is giving you a perfect
[595.28 → 601.60] result out of the box, but that's not really the intent now our review of any Apple Silicon device
[601.60 → 608.40] is yet to be finalized, but early results are both promising and a little surprising even after reading
[608.40 → 613.36] other reviews says Anthony young so that's a note from him on the end of the notes here we are getting
[613.36 → 620.08] into man it's like oh it's a flipping rabbit hole it's like the challenge is if you get access
[620.08 → 624.24] to the people ask like why it matters I posted a tweet a little while ago complaining that we
[624.24 → 629.92] didn't have a PlayStation 5 before launch and people were like oh you spoiled piece of crap why
[629.92 → 634.40] why should you get a free PlayStation when other people have to wait for it and pay for it you
[634.40 → 639.92] should just wait your turn it's like how do i how do I explain this in a way that you can understand
[639.92 → 646.88] I don't want a PlayStation I don't care I haven't owned a PlayStation since the PlayStation 2.
[646.88 → 653.04] it makes it means nothing to me like if I wanted to play a PlayStation game I would borrow PlayStation
[653.04 → 658.16] and play it and then I would not need to own it anymore like it's not the kind of thing that I use
[658.16 → 664.40] regularly the reason that I want a PlayStation is so I can do my job so I can do it properly so that
[664.40 → 670.72] instead of being put in a position where I am forced to choose between getting way less viewership
[670.72 → 677.36] on the content or phoning in the content and rushing it I don't have to do that if I have
[677.36 → 682.72] access to the hardware early in the case of the PlayStation would have had happily bought it early
[682.72 → 688.32] if I have access to the hardware early then what it does is it makes it so that I can be well-informed
[688.32 → 692.72] on the topic you know being able to talk to Sony like hey what are you expecting to be good about
[692.72 → 697.60] this what are you expecting to be not so good about this here's what we found does this jibe with
[697.60 → 701.68] what you're seeing in your lab that kind of dialogue is really important to make sure that
[701.68 → 707.52] we've got the correct story for you guys the other thing is well actually yeah that's that's like really
[707.52 → 713.20] really important right the other thing is that we produce video not written articles so we can't just
[713.20 → 720.00] like bang something out yes people often forget this we can't just bang something out in an
[720.00 → 726.40] afternoon it's actually not an option we have to we have to test it we have to script we have to film it
[726.40 → 731.52] we have to edit it we have to export it we have to upload it we have to make sure it actually all
[731.52 → 736.16] still works I mean we've seen it before you upload a perfectly good video file to YouTube and the
[736.80 → 744.48] well it's broken when you go to try and watch it um so that's why it is so important so what happens
[744.48 → 748.48] then is if you don't have access to something early you're put in the position where either you
[748.48 → 754.56] need to release a piece of content that's not as good, or you need to release one that's perfect so
[754.56 → 761.36] Anthony is digging into like everything we're talking uh there are complaints about multi-monitor
[761.36 → 767.60] support um some of the reviews have covered this pretty well others didn't touch on it at all
[768.24 → 774.48] but one of the limitations of the m1 silicon max is that you can only have one display connected to
[774.48 → 779.76] one of the thunderbolt ports the other one needs to be on HDMI that's something that's not a game
[779.76 → 783.84] breaker by any stretch of the imagination, but it's something people might not realize, and it's
[783.84 → 789.20] definitely good to know um what are some of the other little like kind of idiosyncrasies that
[789.20 → 793.12] we've noticed and that are looking into I don't know you think about that something I would something
[793.12 → 799.12] I would say as well as like if you want reviewers to get things early as well of course
[799.76 → 804.56] if reviewers get it early they will have more time to hopefully be able to make a better video and if
[804.56 → 812.00] reviewers can make a better video and uh you have more of viewers to cross-reference with and hopefully you
[812.00 → 818.08] are able to trust the mass amount of reviewers that you are able to reference um you should be
[818.08 → 822.24] able to make a much more informed purchasing decision which should hopefully be able to either save you
[822.24 → 827.92] money or make you more confident and happy with the purchase that you do make it is directly beneficial
[827.92 → 834.56] and it should help um i I would think the majority of the audience watching would be against pre-orders in
[834.56 → 841.68] general um this helps the whole idea of wanting to have something early but not wanting to pre-order
[841.68 → 846.00] it because you can go into the purchase more confidently that way so I don't know it's one of
[846.00 → 852.64] those things where to me, it's very confusing when people take the position that we should just take the
[852.64 → 858.24] manufacturer's word for it because how many times has that worked not worked out well for us the funny
[858.24 → 864.24] thing to me and I'll probably get into this in more depth and certainly more eloquently in the Mac mini
[864.24 → 869.44] review which I think is going to be the one that comes first the funny thing to me is that apple didn't
[869.44 → 876.64] have to run their presentation that way like I still stand behind everything I said about if it was a
[876.64 → 882.56] really horrible way for them to launch this product for the people that just take everything apple says
[882.56 → 889.04] at face value I guess it was fine because they loved it but for the people that see unlabelled graphs
[889.04 → 897.84] and vague claims about performance it was really discouraging because to me my general experience is
[897.84 → 904.08] that the more confident a manufacturer is the more willing they are to put hard numbers behind their
[904.08 → 909.84] product when they're not confident that's when they start bringing up unlabelled graphs and
[909.84 → 921.84] uh just kind of being like yeah it's its way faster it uh six times because I don't know it's just
[922.56 → 929.52] it's funny to me with everything we've seen from m1 so far we would have liked it just fine if they had
[929.52 → 936.88] just said what it actually was if they had just come in and said it's got anywhere from half to 80 of
[936.88 → 944.48] the performance on non-native x86 apps I would have been blown away I would have been like that is so
[944.48 → 951.20] cool here if they'd have been like here are some apps and here it is tested you know on a native binary
[951.20 → 959.76] versus an x86 one, and it's like yeah anywhere from 50 to 80 I'd have been like wow but then when they come
[959.76 → 968.24] out, and they're like 6x the performance my BS detector goes off hard very hard, and it was so
[968.24 → 975.92] unnecessary all they had to say was yeah it's got performance that is competitive with or better than
[975.92 → 981.52] basically any other laptop processor on the market seems like they kind of ignored AMD in a big way
[981.52 → 987.20] which I thought was interesting given that AMD has better low power mobile processors than intel right now
[987.20 → 992.96] assuming you can find any to buy which even if they do they're not super mainstream yet yeah well
[992.96 → 998.72] that's because they can't make enough yeah and and like but AMD right now AMD gaming processors
[998.72 → 1004.48] are popping off in the enthusiast space, and you are seeing a lot more um like pre-build options with
[1004.48 → 1010.40] them and whatnot but still if you ask like um some random person that has no interest in computers if
[1010.40 → 1014.72] you ask them what AMD is they probably have no idea if you ask them what intel is they almost certainly know
[1014.72 → 1023.68] by the way I'm getting feedback on multiple platforms right now that I am notably too loud
[1023.68 → 1030.80] oh I'm so sorry about that I will fix that for you thank you very much multiple platforms there you go
[1030.80 → 1037.36] got that all fixed up for you all right so I mean I guess I don't really have anything else to say
[1037.36 → 1042.64] um a lot of people are expecting me to come out and say I was wrong um so far I haven't been wrong about
[1042.64 → 1051.44] anything yet the one bold prediction that I made um was that apple will drop support for these m1
[1051.44 → 1058.08] processor max sooner than they will for the m2 or whatever they end up calling it sooner than they
[1058.08 → 1064.40] will for their m2 max and not just by like a year not by like a product release cycle, but they will not
[1064.40 → 1069.44] support them for as long a period of time I could end up being wrong about that, but we're going to have to
[1069.44 → 1076.32] wait anywhere from three to five to six years in order to find out um everything else that I said i
[1076.32 → 1084.72] stand behind I have been I have been attacked on many sides for calling the new m1 max and what
[1084.72 → 1091.92] did I call them an iPad without a screen and iPad without a touch screen and then an iPad with
[1091.92 → 1098.64] a touch bar or something like that, and they're like you don't understand and I'm looking at it
[1098.64 → 1105.68] going no you don't understand what's wrong with the iPad is the iPad bad
[1109.76 → 1116.72] that is so that yeah like are these people just projecting their internal you know hate of the iPad on
[1116.72 → 1123.84] me on my statement what's wrong with the iPad I mean we've come out and said the only thing missing
[1123.84 → 1133.76] on the iPad is macOS in review in positive reviews of the iPad most recently our most recent iPad videos
[1133.76 → 1138.80] the titles are and these actually capture the sentiment of the video I think pretty well in
[1138.80 → 1142.96] this case sometimes our titles are a little like hey we really need you to click on this
[1142.96 → 1150.40] so I search for iPad we need to take this one homeboys here's our last two videos about the iPad
[1151.20 → 1158.56] fine the iPad Pro is a laptop magic keyboard review from five months ago and also from five months ago
[1158.56 → 1166.32] we edited this video on an iPad Pro those are our last videos about the iPad basically saying the iPad
[1166.32 → 1172.40] pro is a laptop and by the way it's powerful so when I call the Mac mini an iPad without a screen
[1173.36 → 1182.56] it's not a sick burn it's just it's just a joke like chill the out what is wrong with you
[1182.56 → 1191.04] you get so defensive people were so mad that I quote unquote used Google Maps 3d view as a benchmark in my
[1191.04 → 1198.00] unboxing of the MacBook Air the new MacBook Air a was not a review so many people called it a review
[1198.00 → 1203.76] do you are you that disconnected you don't even understand what a review is any more somebody
[1203.76 → 1209.68] opening a box is not a review Lou from unbox therapy does not do reviews
[1211.84 → 1218.08] it's its just it's and unboxing it's impressions it's thoughts it's not a review and also what the
[1218.08 → 1224.40] hell is wrong with Google Maps 3d view as a way of evaluating quickly and easily if a thin
[1224.40 → 1231.20] and light is going to chug in basic 3d tasks I've seen it if you have crappy onboard graphics it sucks
[1231.20 → 1237.04] the pop-in takes forever, and it's slow to render so one of the one of the commenters said uh and I'm I'm
[1237.92 → 1242.72] changing his statement slightly because I like it this way more, but you're reviewing the unboxing
[1242.72 → 1253.92] experience no you're not and if you are, it's not a review oh it's all what if it is but what if it is
[1253.92 → 1260.16] because there 's's a lot of thought and uh and and and money and research that goes into improving
[1260.16 → 1269.76] the unboxing experience you have commented in the past on packaging materials which i also
[1269.76 → 1278.08] did in this case on included information in how things are on the presentation of the product
[1278.08 → 1283.76] you know there was a while there with Logitech mice where like the box like hinged open and
[1283.76 → 1288.40] the mouse was like nicely presented up top it was all beautiful and stuff you've commented on those
[1288.40 → 1294.00] things you have reviewed the unboxing experience, but that's not a review of the product I feel like
[1294.00 → 1301.84] the review is kind of like dying you know like people don't even understand what is supposed to be a
[1301.84 → 1307.92] review and what isn't, and sometimes it even happens when people are defending me like I did a
[1307.92 → 1314.56] sponsored video a little while ago about a product and someone was like um okay so there
[1314.56 → 1320.56] were two misunderstandings that I was reading in the comments here, so first someone said this review
[1320.56 → 1328.88] shouldn't be sponsored and I was like okay so problem number one nothing sponsored is ever a review
[1329.68 → 1336.88] and then the second person defended me they were like uh Linus is Linus oh no, no no, no no, no I remember
[1336.88 → 1341.84] no I remember it's different video so it was not a review it was just like experiencing a thing i
[1341.84 → 1348.56] think it was the uh RTX 30 90 8k thing so someone was like complaining they were like this
[1348.56 → 1356.16] review wasn't very thorough and I was like okay well it wasn't a review for one thing it wasn't it wasn't
[1356.16 → 1363.20] structured like a review it wasn't positioned as a review it wasn't called a review the very fact that you
[1363.20 → 1370.96] think that this was intended to come across as a review means reviews must be kind of like dying
[1370.96 → 1379.12] like when's the last time you saw a review of a product a review has to be positive points negative
[1379.12 → 1385.20] points um evaluating it from the point of view of either one niche, and you got to be kind of upfront
[1385.20 → 1390.48] about that or from like a general use sort of standpoint where you look at it try to look at it from
[1390.48 → 1396.64] different perspectives you're analyzing a product um and then and then the defence of it the defence
[1396.64 → 1404.00] of it was this is someone defending my video they're like uh no this was a perfect review because
[1404.00 → 1408.16] everything Linus said was totally true about the product and besides who cares he's got to get paid
[1408.16 → 1414.32] it doesn't matter if a review is sponsored yes, yes it does it absolutely matters if a review gets
[1414.32 → 1420.48] sponsored if it is spot okay if it's not a review it's not a review that's step one and if it's
[1420.48 → 1427.44] sponsored it is not a review now that doesn't mean that a sponsored video can't have good information
[1427.44 → 1433.84] about the product, and it doesn't mean that a sponsored video has to contain lies we are very
[1433.84 → 1439.84] careful about it when we do a sponsored video we would never do a sponsored review when we do a
[1439.84 → 1444.64] sponsored video we make sure that if there's something about this product some drawback that
[1444.64 → 1449.84] we feel is a very important for our audience we push back on the sponsors we make sure that we can
[1449.84 → 1456.08] include it because people gotta know like for example the Oculus Quest video or quest 2 video
[1456.08 → 1462.64] we talked about how much of a bummer it is that the thing runs at 72 hertz because it is that's a bummer
[1462.64 → 1468.56] we even included the mandatory Facebook account, and we were like well you guys got to make your own
[1468.56 → 1473.04] decisions about that, but this is something we can't sweep under the rug this is something that we
[1473.04 → 1478.96] have to talk about so just because it's sponsored doesn't mean that it can't have good information in
[1478.96 → 1484.96] fact the FTC guidelines stipulate that you're not allowed legally to say anything you don't actually
[1484.96 → 1493.36] believe in a sponsored video now of course I know for a fact that people do it anyway yeah, but it's
[1493.36 → 1501.04] something that I personally take very seriously it's just not a review anytime you see a sponsored
[1501.04 → 1507.92] video you have to assume that a brand representative or representatives and in many cases a brand agency
[1507.92 → 1514.48] has watched it and signed off on it that's just part of the process now that's not the case if we
[1514.48 → 1521.68] make a video about let's say this totally hypothetical scenario uh you know unpacking and like
[1522.24 → 1529.12] reacting to a six terabyte memory server, and then it's like sponsored by pulse way, and we do some pulse way
[1529.12 → 1535.84] talking points totally not the same thing because pulse way while they do have a software suite for
[1535.84 → 1542.96] managing and maintaining servers um has nothing to do with this particular server you can use pulse way on
[1542.96 → 1549.20] any server like it's non-conflicting these two things are related so pulse way might want to sponsor that
[1549.20 → 1553.92] video because they feel like oh anyone watching a server video might want to also know about pulse way
[1553.92 → 1559.04] but that's that that's not like a conflict of interest in any way it's only when you have the
[1559.04 → 1564.56] actual creator of the product sponsoring the content, so a perfect example of this would be something like
[1564.56 → 1571.76] intel's video where they sponsored our showcase is what I would probably call that our first kind of
[1571.76 → 1579.20] use of their cry cooler that was not a review I was not in a position to make my own judgment on
[1579.20 → 1584.88] the product all I was doing was getting early access to the product which don't tell intel this
[1584.88 → 1589.76] but I would have like totally done it for free without a sponsorship because I was like super stoked
[1589.76 → 1595.84] to try it out so all I was doing was getting early access to the product and going through that review
[1595.84 → 1601.92] process with intel where they have to approve the content ultimately everything I said in that video was
[1601.92 → 1608.80] true every result we showed was one that we measured, but it was not a review yes go ahead
[1609.36 → 1613.52] so we've got some we've got some naysayers in the audience and I want to try to address some of their
[1613.52 → 1622.00] comments sure hit me um someone's pointing out with the I think a few different people mentioned the quest video
[1622.00 → 1629.60] apparently it was not titled as a showcase no it wasn't titles as a showcase, but it also wasn't
[1629.60 → 1635.36] quite a showcase one of the differences with the quest video is that instead of just talking through
[1635.36 → 1642.24] the talking points we were given a great degree of autonomy, and we were allowed to share our experiences
[1642.24 → 1647.84] with it in a very transparent manner I was actually I was kind of surprised to be honest with you
[1647.84 → 1656.96] um so given that it wasn't really handicapped by the brand in any way we went with a title that just didn't have
[1656.96 → 1663.04] anything in it, and we also didn't structure it or present it as though it was a review we said look this is sponsored
[1663.04 → 1672.32] by Facebook here we go so do you think in what is your opinion of the the the audience not necessarily
[1672.32 → 1677.76] registering that things are reviews do you think that is on the viewers side for maybe some
[1677.76 → 1682.32] skimming too much or something like that or do you think that is potentially more uh the case of
[1682.32 → 1686.72] something like clickbait or like why do you think this is happening uh I think it's a combination of
[1686.72 → 1693.28] things I think it's all three I think consumers are getting either less discerning or maybe they just
[1693.28 → 1700.88] never cared but uh you know media cared enough to do a better job so they just sort of uh had just had
[1700.88 → 1707.20] better information because that's all that there was um, so consumers seem to be more accepting of
[1707.20 → 1717.52] sponsored content and or marketing nonsense um I think that media has gone from being a profession
[1717.52 → 1721.68] well I mean that's right in the word there I think media has gone from being a profession like one you
[1721.68 → 1726.48] go to school for to one where just about anyone and their dog can build a following regardless of how
[1727.28 → 1732.96] true anything they say is or how much they care about transparency and integrity and I also think
[1732.96 → 1741.68] manufacturers are maybe not becoming less transparent because lots of them have been plenty opaque over
[1741.68 → 1750.08] the years but certainly taking advantage of this new advertising paradigm where instead of them having
[1750.08 → 1756.56] to you know pay an agency to create an ad and then run it on a network and check Nielsen ratings to see if
[1756.56 → 1762.32] it was effective and watch their sales um they can pretty much hire you know your tech bro to like
[1762.32 → 1768.24] tell you it's so cool bra hum and they're jumping on that uh before you ask me my next question
[1768.24 → 1773.84] uh travel guys posted I never had a problem with what you said about m1 till now, but you tried to make
[1773.84 → 1779.20] your point and said Surface Pro x was not covered by your channel, but you did cover it uh you're right
[1779.20 → 1785.76] I actually didn't realize that until someone pointed it out to me Riley did that entire video uh he scripted it
[1786.40 → 1791.84] used the product shot if it was edited and uploaded to the channel without me ever actually seeing it
[1791.84 → 1798.00] I did not know we covered it so that is my bad uh my bad I should know if there's something that we've
[1798.00 → 1804.40] covered on the channel especially if I'm going to make a point like we never covered it um I never saw
[1804.40 → 1811.60] it I never touched it so i I didn't care about it at all so that part my main point that I just didn't
[1811.60 → 1819.04] care about it at all still stands apparently Riley cared enough Riley cared enough um okay what else
[1819.04 → 1825.36] you got hit me that's I mean there 's's a lot of comments but I think they're mostly
[1826.32 → 1831.36] vague, and maybe I missed one so sorry if you posted one that wasn't somewhat vague but i think
[1831.36 → 1838.56] it's coming down to just a lot of people are finding that content is very similar um so hard to
[1838.56 → 1846.48] differentiate necessarily during the video um and that with the clickbaity nature of titles and i
[1846.48 → 1852.48] wouldn't I don't necessarily think they are and I wouldn't single Linus media group out for this i
[1852.48 → 1860.00] think it's just like what the world has turned into um with the clickbaity nature that are
[1860.00 → 1866.88] titles on the internet as of now I guess I would say it has become a little bit more difficult to
[1868.08 → 1872.24] you know what that's fair navigate that landscape we don't we don't always put the word review in our
[1872.24 → 1877.76] reviews, and we don't always specifically well okay we would never use the word review to describe
[1877.76 → 1883.52] something that's not a review, but we used to explicitly put review in all of our reviews and
[1883.52 → 1889.44] we don't anymore and that's a that's a fair criticism and honestly I don't know I don't know how to fix it
[1889.44 → 1896.00] in a way that I'm willing to do I could put review in the title of every review but what it ultimately is
[1896.00 → 1900.64] is wasted characters that are going to hurt my SEO and hurt click through on the video
[1901.60 → 1910.08] because if I put you'll never believe what this is and I make this stupid face for some reason 30 to
[1910.08 → 1917.52] 50 to 100 more people click on it and that's one of the few ways sometimes that we can get people to
[1917.52 → 1924.32] click on what is a totally honest evaluation of a product that they just they might be interested in
[1924.32 → 1929.36] by the time they actually watch the video, but they just didn't know it and that's so frustrating is like
[1929.36 → 1936.00] for me what I would want people to do is say wow I love tech and I just want to know about tech and
[1936.00 → 1942.32] click on every video we upload regardless of whether it's a review of a CPU or a graphics card or like
[1942.32 → 1948.24] okay I did a video today that is going to have a cliquey as title because there's just no getting
[1948.24 → 1956.32] around it because what I was covering was a like a compact broadcast 4k camera
[1956.32 → 1962.64] and I needed this camera actually half a dozen of them because due to covid restrictions I can no
[1962.64 → 1969.28] longer watch my son's badminton tournaments in person so I missed out on him missing on him winning
[1969.28 → 1974.64] sorry him winning his first tournament he won doubles in his last tournament I wasn't there to watch any of
[1974.64 → 1983.28] his games, and so I was like well I'm Linus tech tips I can fix this so I'm going to set up their entire
[1983.28 → 1990.16] gym with an uh with a camera on every court and then all the parents are going to be able to watch
[1990.16 → 1998.72] all the games and i have to i have to pay for those cameras somehow Luke i have to pay for them somehow
[1998.72 → 2006.40] so you know what actually so the video is going to be called I've never done anything like this before
[2006.40 → 2017.28] or something like that instead of Marshall CV 420 CR CV 420 CS and i I hate the camera
[2017.28 → 2024.40] but that there's no way I would click on that video Marshall m Marshall review I don't care about
[2024.96 → 2030.80] Marshall m CV camera I'm never gonna unless Brandon's face is in it because I like watching Brandon videos
[2030.80 → 2038.48] about cameras but like i that's if it's a super cool project and our viewer retention numbers show
[2038.48 → 2044.72] that once we can get people to click it they like the videos so it's just you know from my point of
[2044.72 → 2050.88] view as long as the content remains true as long as we keep our transparency keep our integrity I am
[2050.88 → 2058.96] willing to sacrifice the thumbnails and the titles there i I accept it i I don't want it I don't want
[2058.96 → 2065.20] that to be the case, but it is what it is I got another comment from Katya I stopped watching
[2065.20 → 2069.52] your MacBook Air unboxing because it was obvious you were still passing some speculation to undermine
[2069.52 → 2074.96] the product uh no what actually happened was I recorded it almost immediately after my Mac mini
[2074.96 → 2080.24] unboxing, and we just can't like upload two videos to the channel at exactly the same time because
[2080.24 → 2085.44] the algorithmically it's terrible like they'll stomp on each other and then uh people will stop
[2085.44 → 2090.72] getting notifications from you for a bit so it was delayed um i just really didn't know anything
[2090.72 → 2096.32] about it yet so yeah sorry for that but um there's nothing I could really do about it because we
[2096.32 → 2102.08] didn't get those products until launch day if we had had them earlier I would have been able to upload
[2102.08 → 2107.68] them both you know right away like maybe six hours apart instead of a day apart or whatever it ended up
[2107.68 → 2113.44] being because it took time to like edit them we don't need to keep going on this topic and uh
[2113.44 → 2120.00] someone thank you very much to the person that reminded me uh, but we need to do uh ad spots soon
[2120.00 → 2127.12] but someone in all capitals on I love how the twitch guys are like uh and then the float plane
[2127.12 → 2133.76] guys are being helpful and reminding us that we need to do the ad spots but um the the in twitch
[2133.76 → 2140.16] in all capital letters was said Linus is a flip-flopper uh and I know you like addressing that
[2140.16 → 2145.12] topic so I wanted to give you that chance, and then we should jump into ad spots right away flip-flopping
[2145.12 → 2153.12] when new information becomes available is called not being an if you don't flip-flop when new information
[2153.12 → 2159.68] comes out you're a tool that's all there is to it if is the new information is counter to what you
[2159.68 → 2168.72] currently right, right also there was no flip-flop I never said it was going to be bad i literally never
[2168.72 → 2177.92] said it not once so no flip-flopping is absolutely what you should do if there's new information that
[2177.92 → 2185.36] changes the situation that your first response should be to immediately flip-flop immediately because
[2185.36 → 2191.52] if you don't you then you're a filthy fanboy and fanboys are actually the worst people sorry
[2192.32 → 2200.00] you're like actually everything that's wrong with the world tribalism is bad it's terrible so reevaluate
[2200.00 → 2208.64] your life reevaluate your thing that isn't terrible yeah our sponsors uh what do we get here oh wow we've
[2208.64 → 2216.08] actually got some new sponsors today redux is a pc builder striving to bring pc gaming to the masses
[2216.08 → 2223.44] there's no price markup on the parts just a 75 build fee and all builds come with a two-year warranty
[2223.44 → 2228.32] just select your budget pick your games to see how your system is going to perform in them and let them
[2229.20 → 2235.28] build your pc for you uh blah blah blah they only charge a small build fee, and they won't cut corners
[2235.28 → 2240.64] on quality you can start your build today at buildredux.com slash Linus we checked out one of
[2240.64 → 2248.64] their systems in a sponsored not review in a sponsored video over on short circuit and now that my
[2248.64 → 2253.36] obligations are fully complete and I've done everything I said I would do which was open it
[2253.36 → 2259.92] and look at it on camera I can tell you exactly what I think um honestly looks pretty compelling um
[2259.92 → 2267.52] I guess yeah I can tell you whatever I want about if it's digital storm so 75 bucks for something
[2267.52 → 2274.00] built and backed by those guys okay sounds pretty good to me, I think they're going to have to increase
[2274.00 → 2278.88] prices at some point I don't think that's going to last then again I also haven't looked closely at
[2279.60 → 2284.24] they say there's no markup on the parts but I haven't looked at like what the pricing of the parts
[2284.24 → 2288.32] are just because there's no markup doesn't mean that they have the most competitive price on the
[2288.32 → 2294.80] market because who would um you know nobody has the best price on every single part of some random
[2294.80 → 2299.76] computer that's very, very rare um that you're not going to find it you know something cheaper on Amazon
[2299.76 → 2302.88] and something cheaper on new egg and something cheaper at micro centre or whatever the case may be
[2303.84 → 2310.48] uh also brought to you by seal series their Xerox 3 wireless is an ultralight mouse that weighs just
[2310.48 → 2317.76] 66 grams 66 grams my friends sounds evil it has their quantum wireless 2.0 for nearly
[2317.76 → 2323.12] zero latency it's 2.4 gigahertz and Bluetooth compatible so if latency is less important to
[2323.12 → 2327.92] you than compatibility you can flip over to Bluetooth it boasts 200 hours of battery life
[2327.92 → 2334.24] and features USB fast charging for 40 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes their aqua barrier
[2334.24 → 2340.24] technology gives them ip54 dust and splash resistance I don't know about you, but my mouse often gets
[2340.24 → 2345.20] splashed if you know what I'm saying, and you can go to steel series.com Xerox to check out the Xerox 3 wireless
[2345.20 → 2349.92] today look I'm not expecting steel series to get mad about this there were literal there were
[2349.92 → 2356.40] literal hold on a second there were literal pole dancers at a steel series party at CES that I went
[2356.40 → 2362.64] to like eight years ago nine years ago or whatever that probably means nothing like nobody I know at
[2362.64 → 2368.64] steel series is still there um or knew from then at steel series is still there and nobody I know now
[2368.64 → 2376.48] was still there then so like yeah whatever uh this is also brought to you by Wondershare dr phone
[2376.48 → 2380.40] dr phone provides a seamless way to transfer WhatsApp chats between iOS and android device this has
[2380.40 → 2387.36] actually been driving me crazy lately uh okay this is not this is not scripted this is not because of
[2387.36 → 2394.16] the sponsor this has actually been driving me nuts the fact that it seems like the only way to get it to
[2394.16 → 2401.60] transferred somewhat seamlessly is to oh wait yeah no on android that works I did run into this problem
[2401.60 → 2408.24] so on android you have to back up then sign out then sign in the other one then restore if you don't
[2408.24 → 2412.80] do it exactly that way and in that order you'll be missing a bunch of your chats so you can't just like
[2412.80 → 2417.28] leave one of them signed in and then like sign in the other one it will not restore everything it
[2417.28 → 2423.36] drives me absolutely bonkers because I switch phones a lot right um and then with iOS because on android
[2423.36 → 2427.68] if I recall correctly it backs up to google drive and then on iOS I think it backs up to iCloud it
[2427.68 → 2432.88] just like can't be imported so okay that's what they do that's pretty neat they also support transfers
[2432.88 → 2438.16] and backups for WhatsApp business line Viber kick and WeChat, and you can preview and check any item
[2438.16 → 2442.80] you want and export it to your computer as a HTML file for reading or printing the program is secure
[2442.80 → 2447.20] and won't keep modifying or leak any data on your device or in the backup file, and you can get up to 85
[2447.20 → 2453.84] percent off dr phone until December 2nd click the link below to learn more pretty sweet all right
[2454.80 → 2460.88] I might have just sold it to myself how fun is that what else we got to talk about today got some
[2460.88 → 2469.04] pretty good stuff you want to talk about the AMD Rx 6800 series launch or or or not all right
[2469.04 → 2472.64] flow plane guy all right all right all right tell me what's near and dear to your heart Luke hit
[2472.64 → 2479.44] me well we we we talked you know when these cards were coming out and i think we literally
[2479.44 → 2484.40] said the only thing they have to do is have product or something along those lines I don't have the
[2484.40 → 2490.96] actual quote, but it was like it's its got to be close to that whatever it was we actually said yeah um
[2491.60 → 2498.80] like it even if it's not like as competitive as we're hoping as long as they like can sell it
[2498.80 → 2504.80] we'll, we'll be fine we'll be totally fine yeah, and they responded not necessarily to us but to the
[2504.80 → 2509.44] community in general that we're all having the same concerns we were not unique in saying this in
[2509.44 → 2516.32] any way nope um they responded by essentially saying like yeah not going to be a problem we got this
[2516.32 → 2522.88] this launch is going to be way better than the 3000 series no issues there'll be tons of cards
[2522.88 → 2527.36] you can get you can get what you need right well uh
[2530.56 → 2535.52] turns out that didn't really happen uh the launch was much more of a paper launch than anything else
[2535.52 → 2540.48] we had big lineups outside of stores of people unable to get things it seems like several retailers
[2540.48 → 2546.32] including Best Buy USA BNP photo and video which does sell this kind of stuff um and memory express
[2546.32 → 2556.32] in Canada reported receiving exactly zero uh which is awesome uh with no indication of when they would
[2556.32 → 2562.48] be receiving any either AMD's own site along with retailers that did have cards such as new egg and
[2562.48 → 2570.32] micro centre sold out within minutes of sales going live of course unsurprisingly eBay has a ton uh this
[2570.32 → 2576.64] is in spite of AMD's reassurances that supply would be good like I said earlier they did totally
[2576.64 → 2582.56] say that and um and Anthony even has a note here this is the one thing they had to get right and that
[2582.56 → 2588.08] is legitimately true these cards could have been like not even that great, and it still would have been
[2588.08 → 2595.20] a very successful launch if they at least had them at all uh, and they did this is exactly the kind of
[2595.20 → 2601.68] marketing bull crap that drives me crazy, and we talked about this a lot last show all AMD had to
[2601.68 → 2610.08] say was supplies are going to be really limited, and we would have been like okay just at least we know
[2610.08 → 2619.76] just give us the right expectations no guys no we're good I get it we got tons of cards i I get it like it's
[2619.76 → 2627.84] it's its there's only so many seven nanometre like wafers okay there's only so much seven nanometre
[2627.84 → 2634.32] to go around and you know everyone wants it everyone wants a piece of the seven nanometre I mean
[2634.32 → 2640.64] even AMD has competition between their own business units for who gets the seven nanometre at this point
[2640.64 → 2646.56] I'm sure the data centre business unit wants it all for you know uh upcoming server chips and I'm sure
[2646.56 → 2652.48] the gaming business unit wants to just pump out or CPU gaming wants to pump out dozens all day and I'm
[2652.48 → 2659.04] sure that the graphics division is like please i i know we sucked for the last few years
[2659.04 → 2668.48] but please we deserve a chance and there's yeah I get it and uh really unfortunately for them
[2668.48 → 2673.60] that was not the only issues there were some oh yeah Microsoft and Sony they want some seven
[2673.60 → 2679.52] nanometre they want some seven nanometre up in this biz they want a lot of seven nanometre yeah
[2679.52 → 2687.20] like I get it I get it but like just say that or just delay it just say like look you know we
[2687.20 → 2693.76] weren't happy with how much stock we had we delayed it fine i can accept that that's a good guy AMD
[2693.76 → 2698.24] or you can just be honest and just be like we're not happy with the amount of stock we have but we
[2698.24 → 2703.04] want to launch it now so like it's going to be tough to get, but we're going to do our best to like
[2703.68 → 2709.84] try to keep it out of scalper hands which is not entirely possible, but we will do what we can yeah
[2709.84 → 2717.44] um etc and then just try to move on from there that's all fine uh there were also some issues uh ray
[2717.44 → 2722.88] tracing performance was abominable uh the lack of tensor core equivalence means that fans of NVIDIA's
[2722.88 → 2729.84] RTX voice and broadcast software will have to stay green for now yeah um although I haven't heard way
[2729.84 → 2735.44] too much about RTX voice in a while have you um I mean you don't really have to hear much about it to
[2735.44 → 2740.88] know that it's like pretty cool I don't think it's really oh yeah I don't think it's not cool i just
[2741.92 → 2747.04] yeah yeah the news is just kind of passed I think yeah this is great courageous potato on float plane
[2747.04 → 2755.76] says now I'm picturing AMD execs playing poker with seven nanometre wafers totally right the RTX one
[2755.76 → 2760.56] is just like strung out at the end of the table come on guys i have to win this game I mean they're worth
[2760.56 → 2766.64] their weight in gold basically right you think about it like I mean probably more than there is no AMD
[2767.36 → 2776.72] literally every dozen CPU they could possibly make would fly off a shelf right now like the more you can
[2776.72 → 2782.80] make the more money you make you're not constrained by anything else marketing distribution pricing you
[2782.80 → 2790.24] are constrained by how many of these bloody things you can crank off of the production line and the
[2790.24 → 2796.24] reality of it is that for everyone out there saying intel's doomed AMD's got them by the balls now
[2797.04 → 2806.08] that's something intel has for better or for worse is lots and lots and lots of 14 nanometre wafers
[2806.72 → 2815.60] a whole ton of them probably more than they want so you know intel's going to keep selling CPUs until
[2815.60 → 2822.56] AMD figures out either you know a big investment in TSMC so that TSMC can literally build out production
[2822.56 → 2828.88] that is guaranteed for AMD um you know apple has invested heavily in TSMC it's no accident that apple
[2828.88 → 2834.72] got all the five nanometre right out of the gate um, or they're going to have to go back to having their own
[2834.72 → 2840.00] fabs which I honestly don't see ever happening again I just don't think it's i I don't think
[2840.00 → 2847.92] it's possible NVIDIA showed the world that you can be a top tier chip company without ever owning a fab
[2847.92 → 2856.00] and uh AMD has now shown the world that you can come back from owning your own fabs to right back on top
[2856.00 → 2867.28] without owning your fabs so yep I think it's just going to be the uh the Samsung TSMC show
[2867.28 → 2872.64] for the foreseeable future until some of the Chinese fabs that are starting to catch up actually get
[2872.64 → 2880.96] there oh also intel and intel uh what else we got what else is going on here for those who receive
[2880.96 → 2885.76] your cards there are a few niche advantages to look forward to um the reset bug that has long
[2885.76 → 2892.48] plagued virtualization enthusiasts has been fixed oh that's cool that was a big problem for us on um
[2893.44 → 2899.68] seven gamers one CPU if one of the VMS crashed I had to restart the entire host machine
[2900.32 → 2906.80] um, and it was really unstable so it is like cost me a lot of time a lot of hair pulled out overall support
[2906.80 → 2913.84] in Linux appears to be solid, and you can enable rage mode for the memes um Anthony notes i really
[2913.84 → 2919.28] love this they should add a feature to immediately quit out of a game like a button on the graphics
[2919.28 → 2925.44] card and call it rage-quit they should, it should have like some animation that comes up, and it should
[2925.44 → 2931.36] like delete the desktop icon for the game or something or it could still be an overclocking
[2931.36 → 2936.56] feature, and it could just intentionally overclock your card too far, so the whole just, just crash you out
[2936.80 → 2947.52] intentionally crash your own computer that'd be great oh yeah I mean it is like it's the best time
[2947.52 → 2955.20] to buy a gaming pc and also the worst time to buy a gaming pc like there is compelling hardware out there
[2955.20 → 2964.72] just good luck getting your hands on any of it yeah like dozen 5000 RTX 3080 that sounds pretty flipping good
[2964.72 → 2970.88] can't get it when was the last time we had I feel like it's been a long time maybe I'm totally wrong
[2970.88 → 2976.96] here but when's the last time we had these types of paper launches' oh wow I feel like it's been
[2976.96 → 2982.24] a super long time so in fairness like they're all basically so for people that are like what
[2982.24 → 2987.44] are you talking about when a product is announced, but it like doesn't really exist or
[2987.44 → 2994.80] in this case where it exists, but it's basically only scalpers getting it an opinion yeah there are
[2994.80 → 3002.40] some products in the way past which were launched but like I think literally nothing existed
[3002.40 → 3011.92] from them um these are not quite that but not since 600 series from NVIDIA uh or like it's 600 series if i
[3011.92 → 3018.24] recall correctly had pretty good availability and was not so much more compelling than 580 that it was
[3018.24 → 3023.36] like flying off the shelf to the degree that I suspect RTX 3000 is I think there are two things that
[3023.36 → 3031.20] happened here one is NVIDIA launched RTX 3000 and made it very, very appealing from a price to performance
[3031.20 → 3037.68] standpoint and I think NVIDIA really does have a lot of wafers they just cannot make enough of these things
[3037.68 → 3044.00] um then AMD walked into a bit of an unusual situation for them one they had a product that
[3044.00 → 3050.80] was actually competitive so that's going to drive demand up two they walked into a marketplace where
[3050.80 → 3057.68] there's this pent-up demand for a graphics card any graphics card because people you know their
[3057.68 → 3063.60] neighbour or friend or gaming buddy or whatever has a RTX 3000, and they're still running some you know
[3063.60 → 3070.64] pleb 780 or 770 that they're just they've been this is the moment they're ready to pull the trigger
[3070.64 → 3076.32] and there's nothing to freaking buy, and they would have bought an am done, and they'll yeah they'll go
[3076.32 → 3080.72] if they could find it they'll go out and do it and so AMD is walking into two things they're competitive
[3080.72 → 3087.76] for the first time in forever and there's this pent-up demand in the market that we haven't seen in
[3087.76 → 3093.12] forever because people haven't been that excited new GPUs come, and it's like yeah well you can pay more and
[3093.12 → 3100.32] it's faster, but this is different now you're paying less, and it's way faster it's great yeah
[3100.32 → 3106.64] yeah and like i I genuinely think a very large amount of people skipped 2000 series, so there's a lot of
[3107.36 → 3114.24] like enthusiast 1000 series owners that like would normally buy a new card but then saw 2000 series
[3114.24 → 3122.24] come out, and we're just kind of like uh even now they want something new even 1000 980 980 ti was like
[3122.24 → 3128.80] remember how long we were using 900 series cards and like high-end scrapyard words builds and stuff
[3128.80 → 3138.32] like they're a good value even now yeah i 1000 series was a pretty nice jump for VR but if is
[3138.32 → 3145.76] you didn't care about that yeah it was kind of uh um what do we get here uh hey Linus this has been
[3145.76 → 3150.72] bothering me in secret shopper part one when you said Yankee and took all the chips were you referring to
[3150.72 → 3157.04] studio c's poker face no I was just trying to come up with the silliest most irrelevant thing to
[3157.04 → 3162.40] say when you win at poker and Yankee came to mind and that's we actually did many different takes of
[3162.40 → 3167.36] it with me saying different things and Yankee was the take that ultimately ended up in the video so
[3167.36 → 3171.36] there now you know the backstory behind that that one line
[3173.68 → 3179.68] um all right what's our next topic for the day apple has dropped their app store fees
[3180.72 → 3189.12] is this in response to epic well they didn't drop epics fees so I'm going to go with so yes but also
[3189.12 → 3196.08] yeah yeah I think that's pretty accurate I was going to say I do think it's actually in response to
[3196.08 → 3201.92] them but with a direct jab almost yeah um want to talk us through this because there's more to this
[3201.92 → 3208.56] than meets the app yeah, yeah so when you first read it, it's its it's interesting this will affect
[3208.56 → 3215.12] um these are some awesome stats that were put into the doc this will affect 98 estimated of app developers
[3215.12 → 3224.96] um, but companies like epic are going to fall into the um there's going to be a lot of percentages
[3224.96 → 3233.28] thrown around so the 98 is the amount of total app developers on the uh the iOS store um epic games
[3233.28 → 3241.20] falls into the two kind of percent of developers that are going to be charged 30 percent um the 98 of
[3241.20 → 3248.48] developers are going to be charged 15 this is very nice for those 98 of developers small developers
[3249.36 → 3258.32] but yes small developers and those small developers those 98 of developers only make up five percent of
[3258.32 → 3265.36] the app store revenue yeah so the vast majority of app store revenue is still going to be at 30 so
[3265.36 → 3270.96] the line is between developers that earn under a million dollars annually and developers that
[3270.96 → 3275.84] earn over a million dollars annually and this is just fascinating insights because now we
[3275.84 → 3282.32] know that it's two percent of app developers that make up 95 of the revenue on the app store
[3282.32 → 3289.60] and 98 of app developers all making less than a million dollars annually that are 98 of apps for
[3289.60 → 3297.20] developers sorry uh all that blah blah blah making up yeah whatever so 98 of them make less than a million annually
[3297.20 → 3304.16] yeah yeah yeah, so this is uh really, really cool for those 98 of developers even though it's
[3304.16 → 3308.48] only five percent of app store revenue and that that kind of gives it a little bit of a womp
[3308.48 → 3316.80] that's that's because there are these like super apps essentially yeah that like Fortnite Pokémon Go
[3316.80 → 3322.56] these apps that an insane amount of people install and an insane amount of people spend tons of
[3322.56 → 3327.84] money on that doesn't mean that a five percent section of the app store is actually a small
[3327.84 → 3333.52] amount of money that's still a lot there are a lot of developers that are thriving and surviving
[3333.52 → 3340.88] in that five percent category and them making or them going from a 30 take on apple side to a 15
[3340.88 → 3347.12] take on apple side is going to be fantastic especially because a lot of those develop if you're in
[3347.12 → 3352.16] support of those developers I guess um especially because a lot of those developers are going to be
[3352.16 → 3358.32] selling things through the app store that don't cost to produce they probably have to pay for
[3358.32 → 3363.44] something else in order to entice those customers like bandwidth like development like whatever
[3363.44 → 3369.84] else but the actual item that they are selling which is very often going to be digital uh does not
[3369.84 → 3375.92] cost to produce so that's just 15 more money in their pocket which is fantastic, and they must have
[3375.92 → 3384.08] already had a model that fit at 30, so this should just be profit yeah nice little windfall to be
[3384.08 → 3388.32] clear Luke doesn't mean it doesn't cost to produce you have to produce it in the first place even if
[3388.32 → 3394.56] it's like a cosmetic you know a cosmetic jock strap for your little jousting game or whatever um you have
[3394.56 → 3400.72] to produce it, but it doesn't cost more to replicate it I guess is yeah another way of putting better way of
[3400.72 → 3404.96] saying it like delivering that product to the customer is only basically going to have a
[3404.96 → 3411.04] bandwidth cost if it's uh okay you get to open a loot crate now um like you don't have to manufacture
[3411.04 → 3417.12] the items that are in the loot crate yeah exactly, so there 's is like little tiny miniscule bits
[3417.12 → 3422.72] of cost related to that, but those are not the the're they're not very important in this
[3422.72 → 3431.52] scenario um this slow plane right no can we apply you have to apply for the program um apple didn't
[3431.52 → 3438.24] clarify why you have to apply for the program instead of just automatically really not surprised
[3438.24 → 3445.60] um although I would suspect that basically everyone is going to be okayed I'm assuming they want people
[3445.60 → 3451.52] to apply just so that they have that little bit more control just in case someone finds some weird
[3451.52 → 3456.96] loophole that they can try to get through and apple will have the ability to be like no, no no, no much
[3456.96 → 3466.56] more easily um I wouldn't also be too surprised if it takes them forever to go through the application
[3466.56 → 3473.28] process um, and it's like two weeks per attempt, and they deny you for some stupid junk that takes forever
[3473.28 → 3477.92] to try to fix, and it's a super annoying process I can almost guarantee you that's going to be the case
[3477.92 → 3489.52] um so why not float plane yeah, so one of the issues here is that at 15 percent yeah uh it might be able
[3489.52 → 3495.20] to make sense it's its still not great to be completely honest compared to a lot of the other
[3495.20 → 3502.72] payment processors that we have, but we could probably make it make sense the issue is if is is we're is
[3502.72 → 3509.76] we're rocking and I'm pretty sure this is only based off the uh the iOS stores profits that
[3509.76 → 3515.20] you make but if we're rocking, and we get to the point uh where we're now making a million through that
[3516.08 → 3523.12] uh line of profit I'm stumbling over my words here because i just it would immediately be terrible
[3524.40 → 3532.24] like absolutely terrible um because jumping that extra 15 percent would bring us to one of the
[3532.24 → 3538.16] calculations that we did was just literally zero we wouldn't make any money at all but it also
[3538.16 → 3545.68] wouldn't cost us anything um and that is super terrifyingly bad because we would still have to
[3545.68 → 3554.88] develop for this platform and just make nothing on it right and that so that it just doesn't make sense
[3554.88 → 3562.16] for our business model um we have to use these outside processors uh ladder says just
[3562.16 → 3565.60] charge a little bit more on the Apple app store for float plane you can't, they don't let you do that
[3566.56 → 3573.60] um there's been some stuff that has changed really and I don't remember exactly how it landed out
[3573.60 → 3578.40] and I don't want to misquote here but I believe you like can under certain circumstances if you do it
[3578.40 → 3585.20] properly um, but that was yeah and there's been a couple examples that people have shared with me of
[3585.20 → 3591.76] of apps that have started doing that I don't know if that is like and I've read an article that
[3591.76 → 3596.88] was related about like how you can go about doing that I don't know if that's like entirely what they
[3596.88 → 3604.72] want to happen um there's yeah it's its a little funky can could you cap the income no that wouldn't work
[3606.16 → 3613.60] so there you go it's unclear what happens after you exceed a million dollars of revenue if that happens in 2021 like whether it's um
[3613.60 → 3621.60] like an immediate thing yeah bracketed like uh taxable earnings for example so if your first million would be at 15 percent
[3621.60 → 3631.60] and then if after that it's at 30 percent or something like that um, but you know hey we're definitely gonna look into it and see how that goes
[3631.60 → 3637.68] oh, oh speaking of things that we're going to see how it goes let's see how it goes if people want uh short
[3637.68 → 3645.28] circuit long sleeves so we actually excuse me we actually did have more blanks we had more shirts
[3645.28 → 3651.60] so what we decided to do is print the rest of them um I had stopped production last time because I thought
[3651.60 → 3658.80] the sleeves were too long so it's still the same long sleeve with like very long sleeves from the uh from the
[3658.80 → 3665.28] short circuit one million subscriber celebration video um yeah it's exactly the same shirt the only
[3665.28 → 3670.88] difference is that now that we know that people will actually buy them we don't have to uh just blow
[3670.88 → 3676.64] them away so they're 24.99 we uh increased the price five bucks, so the early adopters still got a great
[3676.64 → 3682.40] deal, but we are going to have them back in stock for a little while we continue to work on sourcing
[3682.40 → 3689.20] our own garments and hopefully actually uh we oh I guess I can announce this we hired someone today
[3689.76 → 3695.92] we hired a fashion designer who has a lot more experience with materials and like pattern making
[3695.92 → 3702.72] than anyone on our team currently and the goal is to be able to make very size inclusive garments that
[3702.72 → 3708.40] are totally custom instead of relying on third parties like a Gilda or a canvas or American Apparel or
[3708.40 → 3714.72] whoever the case may be so you can go check them out ltdstore.com short circuit long sleeves are back
[3715.36 → 3723.04] they're back in stock and what else yeah I just want to there's there are some comments through
[3723.04 → 3727.68] twitch and a few other places where people are trying to tell me like how it works on the iOS store and
[3727.68 → 3734.08] that like bits and twitch subscriptions are like more expensive through the iOS store its trust me it's a
[3734.08 → 3739.20] it's a very weird landscape I've known about the twitch thing for a while I don't know if this is
[3739.20 → 3745.44] the case of the twitch thing or not um, but there is hard evidence that there is special treatment
[3745.44 → 3751.28] on the app store for certain companies for certain groups that play ball in certain ways with apple
[3751.68 → 3757.12] there is even a special thing where if you get your app working properly on I believe
[3757.12 → 3762.00] it's Apple TV you get us you get some special treatment in a few different ways we've thought
[3762.00 → 3768.24] about potentially doing that um us in particular our app was held off the app store for I believe
[3768.24 → 3773.52] close to half a year um and when I finally got on the phone with them, it was admitted that all of
[3773.52 → 3779.60] the reasons that were claimed for why our app was held off the app store for almost half a year were just
[3779.60 → 3784.88] not true and that we had followed all their rules every time and the guy on the phone was like yeah
[3784.88 → 3794.64] I don't know but your app's live now and I'm like cool thanks so like how things work is not it does
[3794.64 → 3801.76] there's you can't the set of rules is extremely unclear what you have to do is make the person
[3801.76 → 3812.56] who's reviewing your app happy that's the rules essentially so like pretty sweet it's been an extremely
[3812.56 → 3822.40] extremely frustrating process to release our app on the app store um Google Play Store's been all right
[3822.40 → 3829.76] we are concerned about getting ourselves into a place again where they might just deny our app for
[3829.76 → 3836.16] half a year yeah because the app can become essentially non-functional due to updates that
[3836.16 → 3841.20] happen for the rest of the platform that you might have to hold back on or else you might break the iOS
[3841.20 → 3848.00] app that you can't update or uh you might yeah you might just have to release that update because
[3848.00 → 3854.24] the platform needs it but the iOS platform or the iOS app might just essentially not even work anymore
[3854.24 → 3859.76] you can't see different types of content etc which it puts you in a really terrible place, and it's
[3859.76 → 3865.84] extremely uncomfortable and extremely frustrating so we try to be very, very careful about not pissing them
[3865.84 → 3872.16] off um someone asked for an update flint 165 over on float plane asked for an update on the mouse pad
[3872.16 → 3877.20] uh the mouse pad just got delayed by two weeks due to covid shipping delays so nothing we can do about
[3877.20 → 3881.92] it we're still hoping people are going to be able to get them by Christmas if they order right away
[3881.92 → 3890.32] but i I don't want to guarantee anything at this point uh I also had a comment that I wanted to read over
[3890.32 → 3896.16] on YouTube I think it went away unfortunately it eventually scrolls on its own, and it looks like
[3896.16 → 3900.64] it went too far away and I don't remember what it was so sorry you missed out i I had really wanted to
[3900.64 → 3907.52] respond to that it was really stupid um oh well you didn't get called out uh what else we got
[3908.16 → 3915.52] ah no one is safe YouTube is adding more ads they have updated their terms of service, and it includes a
[3915.52 → 3920.48] new section that gives it the right to monetize videos from channels that are not yet big enough
[3920.48 → 3928.00] to be part of the partner program but can I throw a hot take in here before we go I have always been
[3928.00 → 3935.20] astonished that this wasn't a thing I know right like and like I am certain people are going to be super
[3935.20 → 3943.36] pissed about this but the entire time YouTube has existed I have been stunned that this isn't how it has worked
[3943.36 → 3949.04] um why wouldn't they want to run ads on videos that they don't have to share the revenue on
[3949.60 → 3955.84] makes perfect sense to me run all the best ads on those, and you would start giving people
[3955.84 → 3961.20] like a profit share sort of uh that started really blowing up on the platform because you want them to
[3961.20 → 3968.96] stay like it is all makes sense it's been very confusing as to why they don't do this so like yeah it
[3968.96 → 3976.96] sucks I don't want ads on everything on YouTube necessarily either but like super not surprised
[3976.96 → 3980.88] well no they're not that's not what they're doing they're not giving the person any of the money
[3980.88 → 3985.52] oh no, no, but they're running at sorry did I phrase that incorrectly, but they're running ads on essentially
[3986.80 → 3993.04] well not necessarily everything but uh definitely things that would fall under ad friendly uh guidelines
[3993.04 → 3998.32] yeah so they basically instead of taking I forget if it's 70 30 or 60 40 instead of taking just
[3998.80 → 4004.80] part of the revenue YouTube gets to take all of it uh so to become eligible for the partner program
[4004.80 → 4009.68] you need 4 000 public watch hours in the last 12 months and over a thousand subscribers, so this would
[4009.68 → 4017.44] be just like any like random video I would be surprised if this has is this actually has a meaningful
[4017.44 → 4026.32] impact on how much ad inventory is available for like full-time YouTubers but i I also worry when
[4026.32 → 4032.08] something like this comes into place where there's a clear conflict of interest um what would prevent
[4032.08 → 4039.44] YouTube from prefer to self-deal rather than preferring to share with their partners as we are
[4039.44 → 4050.88] called YouTube partner I definitely hear where you're coming from I don't think that's necessarily going to happen um and I think that would be pretty trackable so if it does and maybe the the great machine that runs
[4050.88 → 4055.92] YouTube that the YouTube developers don't even fully understand blah blah blah maybe it will just
[4055.92 → 4062.48] automatically start doing that because it's like hey more money um but i I feel like if there was intention
[4062.48 → 4069.60] behind that they would get called out very quickly um I seriously doubt that we would have
[4070.32 → 4078.40] any um yeah I seriously doubt that we would have any tools that would give us any transparency into this
[4078.40 → 4087.68] like fill rates um yeah I mean measure rates so like if people could get roughly as roughly
[4087.68 → 4092.32] accurate estimations of fill rates based on like some massive amount of views they're all over the place
[4092.32 → 4097.44] though so like we would have to a bunch of us would have to collude and see if we all dipped at the same
[4097.44 → 4103.60] time for example right and I'm sure there are groups that do that but I'm not one of the cool kids so I'm
[4103.60 → 4108.88] I'm not in any of those groups something interesting too about the to become eligible for PPP or YouTube
[4108.88 → 4114.32] partners program uh you need 4 000 public watch hours in the last 12 months and over a thousand subscribers
[4114.32 → 4120.08] like you just mentioned that line is pretty important there 's's a few different YouTubers
[4120.72 → 4129.68] I believe one of them was um was dreamed the minecraft speed running guy um i I think he's one of
[4129.68 → 4136.88] them but sorry if I'm totally misquoting that where he had one video that just absolutely exploded but
[4136.88 → 4144.56] it was before he was in the partnership program so it got like millions of views oh ouch, but he made like
[4144.56 → 4150.80] nothing off of that video yeah that's kind of brutal and then had to like to get into the partnership
[4150.80 → 4156.64] program before he could start making money but by the time that he had done that 15 minutes of fame over
[4156.64 → 4165.44] well I mean he's a massive YouTuber but um oh okay never mind he's doing fine now but uh it's its
[4165.44 → 4171.12] like you know it's rough i I don't know what the search term would be for me to try to find this but
[4171.12 → 4176.80] like it has happened with a non-trivial amount of YouTubers and it kind of makes sense
[4176.80 → 4183.04] you would, you might release a bunch of videos that don't get anywhere near that, and then you may release
[4183.04 → 4188.88] one video that like really blows up and potentially starts your career if you can capture even 10 of
[4188.88 → 4192.56] the people that came to that video you might be able to have a career right this has happened quite
[4192.56 → 4198.24] a number of times totally, but you might make nothing off of that one massive video that you released
[4198.24 → 4206.16] which might be worth a huge amount like it's its an interesting setup and again plays very uh benefit
[4206.16 → 4214.48] uh benefits YouTube a lot yeah definitely all right what do you think of the opp extending phone
[4217.04 → 4225.28] I mean is this something people are actually asking for here we go what
[4225.28 → 4236.80] what you know it's kind of more elegant than the fold got that rolling display one quick sec I'd have
[4236.80 → 4246.80] to use an opp phone though man I wish all opp devices just ran oxygen OS like their OnePlus subsidiary
[4247.84 → 4254.88] that would be so much better okay sorry i was listening to dream's video for a second it was dream
[4254.88 → 4261.60] he released a video in 2019 that got seven million views so I'm sure he's doing fine um, but it was
[4261.60 → 4268.80] talking about how he had released four videos that combined to over two million views and across those
[4268.80 → 4274.00] four videos he made zero dollars and I believe the conclusion and I haven't watched the whole video this
[4274.00 → 4279.12] second but I believe the conclusion was that he wasn't in the partnership program yet got it but yeah
[4279.12 → 4287.84] he's definitely doing fine he gets a lot of uh a lot of views but sorry the extending phone yeah oh boy
[4288.96 → 4296.40] man it's definitely, so the problem with the fold is that it's real chunky in the pocket
[4297.92 → 4300.00] I could yeah I don't know I could
[4300.00 → 4309.04] if I didn't if I didn't have to use opp's android skin I think I'd be way more into it way more into it
[4312.40 → 4317.92] it's its interesting its i it's one of those devices where I feel like
[4319.20 → 4325.04] I really wouldn't be surprised if this was and I think we talked about this with folding phones too but
[4325.04 → 4330.16] I really wouldn't be this surprised at all if this was like the direction things were going in
[4330.16 → 4336.72] no yeah totally, and they like would be awesome at some point i I think the concept of it is very cool
[4336.72 → 4343.68] especially once they get like super slick and integrated and this one actually like looks pretty
[4343.68 → 4349.60] nice to be completely honest but still but software so get this it uses their roll motor power train
[4349.60 → 4355.44] to expand the display from 6.7 to a maximum of 7.4 inches, but it can also go anywhere in between
[4356.16 → 4361.36] how are developers going to optimize their apps for this thing like the fold is already a disaster and
[4361.36 → 4371.04] it only has two screen form factors uh apparently it has no kinks or visible folds in the display
[4371.76 → 4377.20] that's wow that's pretty cool and the arc allows the display to roll back without any visible folds yep
[4377.20 → 4382.32] since the rollable display isn't as rigid the device has a two-in-one plate that supports the display
[4382.32 → 4389.28] from the inside this thing looks flipping cool from a hardware perspective i just I'm very, very worried
[4389.28 → 4396.40] about the software I think it's gonna I think it's gonna probably suck oh yeah it might not it might be
[4396.40 → 4403.12] the one time it didn't suck but if Samsung can't do it i I find it hard to believe that opp is going to
[4403.12 → 4409.68] do a better job and the experience on the fold really is a degraded one it's not as good as just
[4409.68 → 4414.64] running a normal android phone you know Instagram looks weird YouTube stories doesn't work and those
[4414.64 → 4424.72] are things that affect me every day yep and I think that's pretty much it oh no one more announcement
[4424.72 → 4431.44] uh intel pc tech support challenge number two is coming RGB edition is happening on November 24th that is
[4431.44 → 4438.00] Tuesday at 10 a.m pacific time I am co-hosting with Dimitri from hardware Canucks and Christopher
[4438.00 → 4443.84] Yi is going to be going up against the toasty bros during the stream intel will be giving away 200 units
[4443.84 → 4451.52] of the special edition the special edition 10th gen core i9 10 900k plus a cry cooler from cooler
[4451.52 → 4456.80] master to go with it so don't miss it is'll be streaming to flow plane YouTube and twitch and i
[4456.80 → 4461.76] remember what that stupid comment that I saw was someone was like this is an actual response from
[4462.32 → 4466.72] from leg about why they don't do giveaways internationally it's because it's really
[4466.72 → 4471.92] challenging well challenging doesn't mean impossible minus you got to have more respect has nothing to do
[4471.92 → 4477.68] with respect it has everything to do with the laws around international giveaways being extremely
[4477.68 → 4483.92] complicated and difficult and or impossible to adhere to there are non-trivial amounts of companies that
[4483.92 → 4489.52] do international giveaways don't know about the issues and are just going to get clobbered if it
[4489.52 → 4494.72] ever comes up, and maybe it won't, but maybe it will so
[4498.24 → 4505.04] it is what it is not a company's fault for example in Quebec it is not a company's fault for
[4505.04 → 4512.56] not running their giveaway in quebec's laws around giveaways are completely ridiculous they make no
[4512.56 → 4516.88] sense, and they make it pretty much impossible for the people that live there to win stuff
[4519.52 → 4526.64] oh gotta do super chats so deal with the law then says this person are you actually this stupid
[4526.64 → 4531.36] like I actually can't tell I'm very sorry but I think you might actually be this stupid do you have
[4531.36 → 4538.56] any idea how many countries and then within those countries how many jurisdictions there are do you have
[4538.56 → 4547.28] any idea how many people's full-time job it would be to give away a computer and get this once you
[4547.28 → 4553.68] want it do you know that in many places you would be obligated to pay import duties and taxes on the
[4553.68 → 4559.44] item so you could basically win if you want a computer you could win a 500 bill it's like
[4559.44 → 4566.08] well okay, and it might not even be able to get there there are plenty of places we can't even reliably
[4566.08 → 4571.60] ship things to so no it's not just figure it out it just like actually is not going to be a thing it has
[4571.60 → 4577.76] nothing to do with respect you just i so when your 12-point chat said as a Quebecer I agree with you
[4578.56 → 4585.44] uh Jonathan solo says wow Linus is disrespecting the people that pay his rent wow um no I'm just dishing out a cold hard fact
[4585.44 → 4594.16] if you don't understand how like international laws work then don't comment on them, it's that simple
[4594.96 → 4602.32] the guy that says i I'm bleeping Linus tech tips doesn't pay rent uh
[4604.56 → 4612.16] uh well I did not personally but commercial real estate that's that's a thing dog that's and
[4612.16 → 4616.96] responsible for that's the thing not really I think it's responsible for is the right term now i
[4616.96 → 4623.20] think people are meeting other people's now everybody's meeting they're like wait you disrespect
[4623.20 → 4629.44] me you disrespect me pay your rent you disrespect me what's that I love you guys are great
[4631.12 → 4636.16] snipe you out of the world with precision oh my gosh that copy pasta yeah
[4636.16 → 4642.24] yeah yeah I don't remember exactly how it goes hold on a second sniper copy pasta that's one of my
[4642.24 → 4650.24] favourites navy seal copy pasta what the did you just say oh no, no hold on what the did you
[4650.24 → 4655.36] just say about me, you little I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy SEALs and
[4655.36 → 4660.72] I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda and I have over 300 confirmed kills I am trained in
[4660.72 → 4667.28] guerilla like that kind warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are
[4667.28 → 4672.16] nothing to me but another target I will wipe you the out with the precision the likes of which you've
[4672.16 → 4677.04] never seen before on this earth mark my words you think you can get away with saying that to me
[4677.04 → 4683.60] over the internet think again as we speak I'm contacting my secret network of spies across the USA
[4683.60 → 4688.16] and you rip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out
[4688.16 → 4692.88] the pathetic little thing you call your life you are dead kid I can be anywhere anytime and I can
[4692.88 → 4698.72] kill you in over 700 ways and that's just with my bare hands not only am I extensively trained in
[4698.72 → 4703.84] unarmed combat but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will
[4703.84 → 4707.12] use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little
[4707.84 → 4712.32] if only you had known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down
[4712.32 → 4716.40] upon you maybe you would have held your tongue, but you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying
[4716.40 → 4721.12] the price you idiot I will fury all over you, I forgot to bleep that one you're
[4724.08 → 4728.64] someone someone someone in twitch chat was just like Linus please don't hurt my family
[4731.12 → 4735.60] um okay so I'm getting requests from all over the place to talk about the user benchmark thing
[4736.24 → 4741.68] oh that's right we were going to talk about that why is that not in the doc don't know it was supposed
[4741.68 → 4749.92] to be copied over yeah oh man user benchmark thing there it is reuse for next week it's
[4749.92 → 4756.56] just scroll down to I don't know page whatever this is its 16 17 somewhere in there 16. All right
[4757.76 → 4768.32] so blah blah blah dozen 5950x versus 10 900k here's my display capture oh that's not very centred so um
[4768.32 → 4778.32] there we go all right so theoretically the 10 900k is like better or something than the 5950x which
[4778.88 → 4786.32] anyone who knows anything knows is not accurate uh, but user benchmark is basically crap I actually got
[4786.32 → 4791.52] I remember this was great I was it user benchmark or real bench I don't I don't remember I think it might
[4791.52 → 4798.16] have been user benchmark I got called out of touch for not using sites like user benchmark I'm pretty sure
[4798.32 → 4802.72] user benchmark I could be wrong I got called out of touch because I just have access to all this
[4802.72 → 4807.04] stuff and I can test it for myself you're out of touch if you like to look down on that no I look down
[4807.04 → 4812.32] on it because it's utterly useless completely meaningless and worthless the way that you find
[4812.32 → 4817.60] out how things perform relative to each other if you don't have access to all of them is you cross
[4817.60 → 4824.80] reference multiple reviews and multiple evaluations you do not use sites like user benchmark because
[4825.52 → 4833.04] well in this case you can see that their scoring can be extremely questionable, and you have no control
[4833.04 → 4837.84] over what people are submitting to them so user benchmark has hundreds of thousands of benchmarks
[4837.84 → 4841.84] submissions in its database that influence the purchasing decisions of nearly 10 million visitors
[4841.84 → 4845.92] each month according to similar web the synthetic benchmark found itself banned from numerous
[4845.92 → 4851.36] important tech related Subreddits but remains one of the most widely visited processor testing sites
[4851.36 → 4859.60] apparently the horizon 9 5950x was not enough to overtake the 10 900k or the 9900ks apparently
[4860.48 → 4864.96] if there was some score waiting based on price then it would be understandable as it is possible to
[4864.96 → 4880.48] get a 10 900k for around 540 bucks whereas AMD's rival is a pricey 799 but while the site insists it is not affiliated with any company once again it has uh grown defensive regarding its skewed scoring system
[4881.68 → 4894.72] uh oh this is a great quote AMD fans continue to smear user benchmark via an army of anonymous accounts on Reddit YouTube and forums which they kind of were asking for considering they called AMD fans an organized army of shills which I mean
[4894.72 → 4906.96] uh well maybe uh that's one thing I can see both sides of in this dispute uh sometimes when you're right you still probably just shouldn't say it
[4906.96 → 4913.12] yeah I mean that's the thing is like you uh you shouldn't just you just shouldn't be a fan of a company because you already
[4913.12 → 4917.84] are you're already dumb like you can't get the right answer by asking the wrong question
[4917.84 → 4924.64] the wrong question is which tech company should I be a fan of which one should I evangelize and root for
[4925.52 → 4931.60] there's no right answer because that's a dumb question um, so anyway this should serve as a friendly reminder to
[4931.60 → 4936.80] fact-check your information cross-reference sources especially when you are plunking down a big chunk of
[4936.80 → 4942.96] change on hardware is this the final nail in the coffin for user benchmark I don't know because I haven't
[4942.96 → 4952.16] paid attention to it ever because it was always stupid so there you go you're welcome yay we should
[4952.16 → 4956.64] probably do some uh man I'm sorry I'm feeling spicy today you know I was even thinking maybe I should
[4956.64 → 4963.28] just like people loved Dave 2d's like chill attitude and I was like yeah maybe I could learn something from
[4963.28 → 4969.44] Dave 2d about how to you know be chill and just you know relax and chill then I got like five times more
[4969.44 → 4978.00] amped up today than I was before so oh well uh super chats that people send for whatever reason
[4978.00 → 4982.96] even though I totally don't need their 20 New Zealand dollars Ryan brown ilia says today is the one year
[4982.96 → 4989.52] anniversary of the 22nd most viewed video in Ltd history when will you hire her she did apply for one
[4989.52 → 4994.40] of the new positions and really um I'm not hiring her for that position which I haven't told her yet so
[4994.40 → 4999.04] if she's watching this will be the first she's heard of that, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[4999.04 → 5002.88] that we will never hire her well she wasn't the most qualified candidate unfortunately so that's
[5002.88 → 5008.24] just the way it is um Robert mail says not sure how much of a YouTuber boomer you are, but jib jab is
[5008.24 → 5017.28] apparently coming back for 2020 I do not know what jib jab is apparently um not enough of a boomer i
[5017.28 → 5022.80] don't even know Ryan brown says Linus say BIC quits I don't know why Ryan wanted me to say that that's
[5022.80 → 5030.24] weird ilia says hashtag higher Madison I'm not saying no I'm just not saying yes there pro tip
[5030.24 → 5036.88] never say anything anyone ever tells you to say on a live stream yeah fair enough I actually can't
[5036.88 → 5043.36] figure out what that would be but just in case in the future uh Jonah says please ask brand to stop
[5043.36 → 5052.16] cursing on my Christian twitter timeline I could ask them but like it's brand oh yeah yeah
[5053.12 → 5059.44] yeah it wouldn't surprise me uh Vítor says thoughts on AMD and maybe intel going consumer arm in the
[5059.44 → 5065.12] next few years following apple well it okay you said consumer that's a good point because AMD has
[5065.12 → 5076.48] actually had arm-based server chips in the past um man it would be a big move for intel to swallow their
[5076.48 → 5083.52] pride and say x86 isn't the right answer to everything like they have been so hardcore down
[5083.52 → 5089.52] that path whether it's atom or what I forget what their x86 um
[5091.92 → 5096.32] mobile CPU so were they atom branded I can't remember, but they've they've tried to scale
[5096.32 → 5102.56] down x86 to be competitive with arms so many times they failed so many times you never know you never
[5102.56 → 5107.44] know I mean I would be interested to see what kind of ideas intel could bring to the table with an arm
[5107.44 → 5113.28] design with an arm license I mean they might have to license it from NVIDIA by that time i actually
[5113.28 → 5119.52] don't know intel probably has an arm license actually intel arm license I'd be I'd be shocked if they don't
[5119.52 → 5130.56] uh 1998 yeah okay produce cello and uh blah blah blah cross license something I don't know what kind of
[5130.56 → 5136.72] arm license they have uh intel we have an arm license no plans to use it as of May 17th 2011.
[5137.28 → 5143.92] there's just not a ton of news regarding intel and arm if their if anything was going to happen soon
[5143.92 → 5150.72] I would expect it to have happened already as for AMD they are less uncompetitive I mean if you look
[5150.72 → 5159.04] at the numbers on anorak's excellent article on m1 performance their zen uh 2 based chips are already
[5159.04 → 5163.60] really not that far off if only they could make enough of them, and you got to remember that AMD is
[5163.60 → 5173.44] on 7 nanometers compared to apple being on 5 nanometers both from TSMC so if AMD got well uh nodes worth of
[5173.44 → 5178.00] improvement out of moving to 5 nanometers it's not impossible that they would be pretty darn
[5178.00 → 5183.20] competitive as for the power consumption that I don't know that we're going to have to wait and see
[5183.20 → 5189.68] how it goes but zen 3 looks like it should be very competitive and then I don't know what it's going to
[5189.68 → 5194.16] be called when AMD goes 5 nanometre I don't know if that's zen 4 I haven't looked at like any leaked
[5194.16 → 5201.52] roadmaps lately, but we'll just have to kind of see how it goes um Jeremy says I really liked the general
[5201.52 → 5206.08] fusion video a few years ago any chance we can get a follow-up or other sustainable tech videos I love
[5206.08 → 5210.64] that kind of stuff it's tough we can't travel right now we actually had a really cool thing that we
[5210.64 → 5218.24] wanted to do with like an um like someone like bought a dam, and they were using it to like mine crypto or
[5218.24 → 5227.84] something it was like uh we were going to go look at the facility and then yeah it didn't yeah um Dave says
[5227.84 → 5232.72] hey guys had to replace my PS4 pro and bought a PS5 off eBay for 640 pounds which I think is a good
[5232.72 → 5239.04] price considering the prices on there I mean uh I would just wait till after christmas
[5239.04 → 5247.68] pricing's going to plummet on consoles yeah oh yeah I mean if this is the Christmas rush everyone wants
[5247.68 → 5252.96] to have it for the holiday oh you mean in terms of like scalping yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[5252.96 → 5261.60] um yeah people in in in various chats are saying don't buy from scalpers don't enable scalpers I would
[5262.40 → 5267.36] I know I'm going to change a grand total of zero people's minds with this but i would
[5267.36 → 5273.76] definitely also say that just wait you'll be fine honestly the launch titles aren't even that cool
[5274.80 → 5281.44] definitely devil's advocate can I play devil's advocate yeah a scalper saved my Christmas in 1994
[5282.96 → 5300.24] the Super Nintendo which she had obtained for me was stolen so what she did to save my Christmas my
[5300.24 → 5305.12] eight-year-old boy Christmas was she went out she bought a Super Nintendo from a scalper she overpaid
[5305.12 → 5310.88] for it but at the end of the day I got my Super Nintendo and those other kids who didn't get one
[5315.92 → 5319.44] i would say in that did I have you until the end did I have you till the end
[5320.00 → 5326.00] all right yeah I would say in that scenario just like print off a picture of it and put it on a box
[5326.00 → 5333.84] and just be like no dog I played like an IOU on there I played Super Mario world on December 25th 1994
[5334.48 → 5340.72] so like suck it that's all I have to say that's all I have to say about that I've probably told you
[5340.72 → 5347.20] this story does you know the story of uh the Xbox that my parents got us I know yeah I've heard it but
[5347.20 → 5354.00] I don't remember the details right now my uh we're at my grandparents place for Christmas and um
[5354.56 → 5362.16] I have no idea how they were able to afford it but my parents got us an Xbox, and they got us halo
[5362.72 → 5369.36] and I was like particularly so stoked about halo one um and like Microsoft releasing a console and I was
[5369.36 → 5373.44] like researching it like crazy I didn't think there was a way in hell we were getting one for Christmas
[5373.44 → 5379.04] I didn't think that was a chance in the slightest but um they somehow made it happen but my dad
[5379.04 → 5385.04] in secret told my brother and i that the big box that was over top of the box that had those things
[5385.04 → 5389.44] because he had like laid them out nicely on the floor they were like nicely presented and then put
[5389.44 → 5395.28] a box on top of them so it didn't look like an Xbox at all this is a huge box he told us it was a
[5395.28 → 5403.68] crystal ball for our mom why do we believe that in the slightest yeah that's the stupidest story ever
[5403.68 → 5411.20] but he told us that it was super cool and that we should try to stop anyone from because we do this
[5411.20 → 5416.96] thing usually where people like pick the present that should be open yeah sure um well no yeah oh okay
[5417.60 → 5422.88] like the person who just received a present yes what present should be open for the next person kind of
[5422.88 → 5427.04] of usually, or it's something it is we change it sort of every year but I think that's what was going
[5427.04 → 5434.32] on that year so my brother and I were like very intently not allowing anyone to pick this present
[5434.32 → 5439.20] because we thought it was for our mom and then if I remember correctly my brother and I like opened it
[5439.20 → 5447.52] together to show it to mom, and we're not looking at the console you literally opened up an Xbox and didn't
[5447.52 → 5455.60] know it yeah I love it that was a that was quite the Christmas that was an I remember the n64 and
[5455.60 → 5466.80] the Xbox were both like holy crap this is amazing oh man uh Ricky bobby says 35 super chat and all i
[5466.80 → 5476.32] got was this lttstore.com t-shirt thanks for that um what else we got here the Rica says channel super
[5476.32 → 5483.92] fun or even the main channel Mac mini infestations laser cutter live up to your perceived apple hating
[5483.92 → 5488.16] self make a bit of money you're welcome I have no idea what this comment meant
[5488.16 → 5502.56] uh the Rica wants me to use the laser cutter to cut up the Mac mini ingest stations on channel super
[5502.56 → 5506.80] fun I would never do that um no
[5509.84 → 5515.52] uh i I talked about how we've switched away from them the uh Brandon and David complained Andy was
[5515.52 → 5519.60] okay with them but Brandon and David didn't like them it wasn't worth the extra speed for them
[5519.60 → 5525.44] um so we're not using them anymore uh so I was saying I should flip them or something in a float
[5525.44 → 5529.76] plane tour of some of the changes around the office we actually just swapped them out I didn't even know
[5529.76 → 5534.64] they were mad about it so it shows you how removed I am from some of the day-to-day stuff like I remember
[5534.64 → 5540.88] I used to build you know every workstation and every ingest station personally and like troubleshoot them
[5540.88 → 5543.44] and now it's just like a sorry what there's a different computer there
[5545.52 → 5554.16] oh all right thanks Jeremy Athena um thanks Abhishek
[5556.00 → 5556.96] um
[5560.80 → 5566.88] my shanty says uh this is some this is some next level tinfoil hat stuff I think apple used
[5566.88 → 5572.64] unlabelled graphs on purpose to get the tech community to make content doubting the m1 and then put content
[5572.64 → 5577.12] out again, and it turned out to be not what they thought to get double the exposure i I don't think
[5577.12 → 5583.36] I actually don't think that's I think they were going to get double the exposure anyway yeah oh man
[5583.36 → 5588.72] genetic asks with the light gray short circuit shirt are there any different coloured hardware
[5588.72 → 5593.84] shorts on the way absolutely, but it's going to take time the new fashion designer just got hired today

[5602.08 → 5608.48] compare m1 chips to dozen Hackintosh if possible in the future I don't know how applicable that comparison
[5608.48 → 5614.08] is until we get m1 based desktops that well okay technically we do have the Mac mini but like
[5616.08 → 5622.72] I'd want something that's more positioned to go up against like a dozen 5000 before I make that comparison
[5624.96 → 5627.52] um hey it's j07
