[0.00 --> 4.88]  spinning up i was gonna say actually it'll start whenever this thing decides that it will
[6.16 --> 13.20]  and welcome to the wang show ladies and gentlemen we've got a terrific show for you guys today with
[13.20 --> 21.04]  all kinds of great tech news this just in amd's ryzen 5000 series is rumored to be able to hit as
[21.04 --> 30.48]  high as six gigahertz when it's overclocked when will amd stop when will they take away the pain
[31.68 --> 37.92]  in other news this week microsoft strikes a profit sharing deal with gamestop we don't have a ton of
[37.92 --> 43.92]  details as to like how exactly this arrangement works and whether or not it will keep gamestop's
[43.92 --> 50.00]  bloated corpse from finally sinking below the surface of the lake but uh hey you know if i
[50.00 --> 54.08]  was gamestop i'd be willing to do just about anything to stay alive too what else we got luke
[55.04 --> 62.00]  uh nvidia is no longer going to be selling 3000 series cards direct online what this will uh
[62.00 --> 67.04]  transition into future releases as well but how will people get founders edition
[68.88 --> 76.24]  um we'll talk about that later also amd motherboard with a soldered a9 9820 to offer performance
[76.24 --> 87.12]  comparable to the xbox one s interesting wait what what i don't know why that matters but it's in the
[87.12 --> 90.72]  dock and we'll talk about it later fantastic
[90.72 --> 98.80]  oh tldr it's probably the xbox one soc interesting
[102.08 --> 102.96]  well then
[105.44 --> 106.40]  how about that
[106.40 --> 120.48]  oh shoot i forgot to put the um i forgot to put the thing in there yeah i didn't put the lower
[120.48 --> 123.52]  thirds so i guess we're just gonna have to skip that okay cool
[123.52 --> 135.92]  all right oh sorry got a little bit of a bug there sorry sorry about that i love this thing so much
[136.80 --> 143.76]  all right why don't we jump right into it with nvidia no longer selling three three thousand series
[143.76 --> 152.00]  cards direct online so this was originally posted by pc mag and tom's guide and basically if you wanted to
[152.00 --> 159.68]  buy an nvidia founders edition card well i guess you're just a lot um because nvidia is not going
[159.68 --> 166.08]  to be selling them on nvidia.com the only way to get one will apparently be through best buy in the usa
[166.08 --> 172.40]  with international outlets not yet revealed you know what that's not as surprising as you might think
[172.40 --> 178.72]  because as i recall when nvidia first introduced their founders edition cards which would have been
[178.72 --> 187.36]  this was that seven well oh was it before that dang i can't remember when they transitioned from
[187.36 --> 196.08]  founders edition or from reference cards to founders edition cards yeah i'm not 100 sure was it 900 series
[196.08 --> 203.92]  or 1000 must have been maxwell i don't know maybe it was before that actually was it 6 680. oh yeah i don't
[203.92 --> 211.28]  remember but nvidia did experiment with making those cards exclusively available at best buy that was
[211.28 --> 216.24]  one of the first in fact i think that was before they were even selling direct on nvidia.com i believe
[216.24 --> 222.56]  best buy was the first place that you were able to get a built by nvidia card and i remember it being
[222.56 --> 231.76]  like a big hubbub in the industry because amd famously transitioned from building built by ati at the time
[231.76 --> 237.76]  built by ati card so you could buy like a first party card to no longer providing those and leaning
[237.76 --> 245.12]  on their ad-in board partners and then nvidia who had traditionally never provided a built by nvidia card
[245.12 --> 250.80]  and had always had ad-in board partners now was all of a sudden transitioning to their own built by nvidia
[250.80 --> 258.48]  cards these these founders edition cards and um there was a whole bunch of upset about well okay nvidia is
[258.48 --> 264.72]  just trying to salvage no not salvage trying to grab even more margin for themselves because
[264.72 --> 271.44]  if there's anywhere from five to eight percent profit in a card like an rtx 3080 let's say for
[271.44 --> 278.08]  example at each the ad and board partner and the retailer level well hey that's nvidia effectively
[278.08 --> 284.24]  making anywhere from 10 to 15 percent more per card on the ones that they sell for themselves so it
[284.24 --> 290.40]  creates a bit of a conflict of interest because if nvidia's partners are relying on them to fairly
[290.40 --> 295.76]  distribute allocation of these hot chips that everybody wants and are basically like printing
[295.76 --> 301.20]  money at this point like the more of them nvidia can make the more money everyone in the ecosystem can
[301.20 --> 307.20]  make um and nvidia is the one responsible for doing it so if they have this incentive to take them all for
[307.20 --> 312.96]  themselves and just sell them themselves for more profit then you know why would they send you know
[313.52 --> 318.48]  msi or asus or evga's full allocation to them why wouldn't they just hold some back for themselves
[318.48 --> 326.08]  so um best buy has been uh one quick thing just to just to insert apparently it happened a lot later
[326.08 --> 332.08]  than i remember it happening um i think that's just because the the visual style didn't change much but
[332.08 --> 340.48]  uh it was uh one one thousand series cards really yeah oh all right yeah i guess that does kind of
[340.48 --> 347.20]  make sense okay once i like saw the article i was like oh yeah okay i just i thought it happened earlier
[347.20 --> 352.64]  than that yeah i thought there was one before that too i thought there was like a like a 760 or something
[352.64 --> 358.96]  like that like much earlier i thought it was 700 series as well so maybe we're we're tripping on something
[358.96 --> 363.92]  but i'm founding articles about like what the heck is a founders edition card and they're talking about
[363.92 --> 373.68]  the 1070 and 1080 got it okay well there you go okay why don't we uh have a look so why why would
[373.68 --> 380.08]  nvidia stop selling themselves because like i said obviously they make another you know five to seven or
[380.08 --> 384.64]  maybe even eight percent profit if they just sell the founders editions through their own website
[384.64 --> 390.32]  the reason is that they have basically thrown in the towel and said well we we just can't
[391.04 --> 397.52]  shucks we just can't figure out how to do this uh without letting the bots get all the graphics cards
[397.52 --> 403.52]  so we're gonna leave it to the professionals here and it wouldn't surprise me if in the future
[404.48 --> 409.20]  nvidia went back to selling founders editions through their own site once the demand dies down a little bit
[409.20 --> 414.48]  but for now they're going to leave it to best buy because best buy has been overall a more reliable
[414.48 --> 419.44]  storefront for card sales when compared to nvidia although it should be noted that that's not by a
[419.44 --> 425.12]  huge margin a recent restock saw best buys 3080 founders edition card staying available for only several
[425.12 --> 435.76]  minutes so none of this is the ideal situation for nvidia but um if they're gonna come out and say that
[435.76 --> 441.44]  they want to make an earnest effort to eliminate bots or not eliminate but you know minimize the
[441.44 --> 447.44]  effects of bots and scalpers on availability of rtx 3000 series cards then they're going to have to
[447.44 --> 452.48]  put their money where their mouth is and take a bit of a hit to their profit in order to make sure that
[453.04 --> 458.96]  customers are actually getting their cards it'll be really interesting to see how all of these
[458.96 --> 465.60]  shortages play into amd's upcoming launch i mean we know big navi is coming in in the coming weeks here
[465.60 --> 473.44]  and uh it wouldn't surprise me based on what amd has done for their past cards if we saw a hard
[473.44 --> 480.24]  launch with availability and if amd manages to pull that off and they're even remotely competitive
[480.96 --> 485.04]  they might get a lot of sales just because people can't even buy the other things yeah just because
[485.04 --> 491.52]  nvidia can't ship a graphics card to save their life it's a pretty interesting concept but i could
[491.52 --> 496.32]  definitely see it like i i know i have a few friends that are looking to get 3000 series cards
[496.80 --> 503.92]  um and and they they've been struggling and not succeeding so it's interesting this is a great
[503.92 --> 508.96]  comment from ninja man away over on floatplane i've never understood why people would buy a founder's
[508.96 --> 514.96]  edition card rather than a third party card when the third party cards are normally better wonderful
[514.96 --> 521.04]  comment so there's a couple of things here the founder's edition or back in the day the
[521.04 --> 527.44]  reference edition cards were typically the like minimum but still decent
[528.32 --> 535.68]  board spec to build a graphics card based on that gpu they'd have no frills or or extra gimmicks or
[535.68 --> 541.84]  anything like that typically no rgb lighting um no factory overclock to speak of because they were
[541.84 --> 549.28]  they were meant to be representative of the you know nvidia approved experience one thing if i can
[549.28 --> 556.56]  insert is also before this generation uh well and i guess it yeah before this generation because of
[556.56 --> 564.96]  the troop swap um they they were also blowers yes which in some cases people like really wanted that
[564.96 --> 569.92]  due to certain airflow restrictions etc sorry keep going so if you had a small form factor case back in
[569.92 --> 576.32]  the gtx 1000 days then you might have wanted uh like a founder's edition style card because it's the
[576.32 --> 583.44]  only way to keep your other components from getting suffocated with rtx 2000 well that option went away
[583.44 --> 590.88]  anyway and nvidia's founders editions moved to like a two fan um sorry whatever the opposite of a blower style
[590.88 --> 595.04]  is so the one that just recirculates hot air in your case it's escaping me at the moment doesn't matter it's
[595.04 --> 601.36]  really not the point oh yeah they did yeah never mind yeah so that was with rtx 2000 um now with rtx
[601.36 --> 608.56]  3000 nvidia has actually positioned the founders edition cards as less of a baseline for performance
[608.56 --> 615.12]  and more as a premium option making them not only priced higher than the cards that you would buy from
[615.12 --> 620.48]  the likes of an asus or msi or whatever else actually last gen they were priced higher if i were
[620.48 --> 624.96]  actually i think they've founders edition has always been more expensive just because that cooler costs so
[624.96 --> 630.96]  much to make like 1000 series was i think a hundred dollars higher on the 80 and i think it was
[630.96 --> 638.08]  like 60 or 75 higher on the 70. so they're not only priced higher because of their fancy pretty cooler
[638.08 --> 648.24]  but nvidia put a ton of work into making the rtx 3000 founders edition cards um really awesome actually
[648.24 --> 654.16]  like okay there's a couple things here one the first party nvidia cards did not have any of those uh black
[654.16 --> 661.04]  screening issues that plagued some rtx 3000s and two the cooler on them is actually outstanding the way
[661.04 --> 667.12]  that it not only helps keep the card cool but also helps cool your system and i don't have any third
[667.12 --> 674.16]  party confirmation of this but what it looks like to me is that nvidia is creating yet another rift with
[674.16 --> 681.84]  their partners by offering cards that um their partners don't have any realistic expectation of
[681.84 --> 687.60]  properly competing with like did you see nvidia's video about what went into the design of the
[687.60 --> 694.48]  thermal solution for the rtx 3080 yeah and i i do also agree with what you're saying it's it's an
[694.48 --> 705.36]  interesting position um and i i think it's a much more attractive play to people purchasing cards than
[705.36 --> 711.52]  than previous founders editions offerings absolutely but what happened was they gave themselves an
[711.52 --> 719.28]  extremely unfair advantage yes nvidia obviously the way that those guys hold their cards so close to
[719.28 --> 726.08]  their chest i pretty much guarantee you that their partners had the minimum minimum possible amount of
[726.08 --> 732.72]  time to work on their uh to work on their board designs for these new chips whereas nvidia was sitting
[732.72 --> 738.64]  there with first party knowledge throughout the entire development process of this product
[738.64 --> 748.08]  knowing okay hey we've got a a 400 watt problem to solve you know how can we solve it if i'm asus or if
[748.08 --> 756.24]  i'm evga or i'm galax or whoever else you know i'm going okay sorry what i have a 400 watt problem to solve
[756.24 --> 762.24]  like uh uh uh and i'm scrambling right like i'm putting it i'm just putting a giant vapor chamber and a giant
[762.24 --> 768.32]  heat sink on it and i'm otherwise going with a pretty traditional board design if i'm nvidia i go
[768.32 --> 776.32]  and i create this fancy pants special angular board and this like flow through design for my cooler that
[776.32 --> 782.16]  nobody can reasonably be expected to compete with until they've had another probably six months
[782.16 --> 789.20]  realistically like six to 12 months to come out and build something similar to and just like we've
[789.20 --> 794.96]  seen in previous generations with all the minds that go into this at nvidia's ad in board partners
[795.68 --> 802.72]  someone is going to create something that is super cool and and totally unlike the the reference or
[802.72 --> 809.60]  founders edition card but if they don't have the time to do it it's not reasonable to expect them to
[809.60 --> 816.24]  be able to so at launch man the uh the founders editions honestly look pretty good this time around
[816.24 --> 821.44]  except that unfortunately with this announcement that nvidia.com will no longer be selling them
[821.44 --> 827.84]  comes the unfortunate news that europeans or anyone outside of the us who can't just walk into a best
[827.84 --> 837.28]  buy will simply not be able to buy them oh my god whoops i didn't think about that part whoopsie
[837.28 --> 845.60]  days um yeah digidude512 in floatplane chat brings up another great reason why people like founders
[845.60 --> 850.56]  edition or reference cards and that's that generally they're the first to get water block support because
[850.56 --> 857.04]  of how common they are compared to say a strix or an aorus card with that said the situation is totally
[857.04 --> 863.20]  improving uh the first block we were able to get our hands on was actually an ek1 for an asus strix rtx
[863.20 --> 869.04]  um that is for the 3090 uh actually i think yeah no it's compatible with the 3080 as well yeah so i
[869.04 --> 873.12]  think they use the same board design or at least dk thinks they do and we did manage to put it on a 3090
[873.12 --> 881.12]  with some small modifications so uh it seems like uh yeah it seems like it's getting quite a bit better
[881.12 --> 886.64]  and so many of the board uh so many of the board makers actually do their own water blocks now like evga
[886.64 --> 894.00]  does or they have partnerships with brands like ek um that it's less of an issue today than it used to be
[895.92 --> 901.92]  so says says but the founders edition cards are not reference cards this year yes that is true the
[901.92 --> 907.60]  founders edition cards are not reference cards to my knowledge there isn't really a reference card that
[907.60 --> 916.56]  anyone outside of you know maybe a board partner would have seen even yeah um all of the rtx 3080
[916.56 --> 921.76]  and 3090s that i've seen from different manufacturers have been completely different boards
[925.52 --> 929.68]  uh unless unless i'm wrong unless there is a reference board that i'm not aware of so guys feel
[929.68 --> 934.40]  free to let me know in the float plane chat i'm looking into it i i haven't heard of anything and i
[934.40 --> 939.12]  don't see anything immediately but yeah in the meantime why don't we jump into the microsoft
[939.12 --> 945.60]  gamestop deal that seems to be kind of like a kind of a last-ditch effort to stay alive for
[945.60 --> 951.44]  gamestop i actually think this makes a ton of sense though so the original article here that
[951.44 --> 958.80]  we read through was on ours technica good article uh gamestop will now get a share in the lifetime
[958.80 --> 965.92]  digital sales revenue for any next-gen xbox console sold through its stores and it's not like there's no
[965.92 --> 970.64]  precedent for actually here hold on let's talk through the rest of the thing first so this includes
[970.64 --> 979.60]  for full game downloads dlcs micro transactions tv and movies and subscription plans now gamestop at
[979.60 --> 985.28]  the time of us making our notes here had yet to respond to a request for comment from ours technica
[985.28 --> 991.92]  and microsoft declined a request to comment from ours technica and so that leaves everyone pretty much
[991.92 --> 999.68]  kind of guessing at what exactly is going on here um some analysts think that the size of the cut it
[999.68 --> 1008.56]  would be less than one percent um some are saying somewhere between one and ten percent um you know
[1008.56 --> 1013.20]  some are saying you know i don't believe that it would be a bigger cut because you know what's microsoft's
[1013.20 --> 1018.00]  incentive here i don't see you know how you know what if they don't have this are they going to sell
[1018.00 --> 1026.16]  fewer xboxes um but honestly i uh i think this makes a ton of sense and i think if i was microsoft
[1026.16 --> 1032.64]  i would be super into a deal like this although it does sound like playstation is potentially also
[1032.64 --> 1037.68]  having conversations about doing more or less the same thing which i'm sure they heard of this partway
[1037.68 --> 1045.04]  through the conversation and we're just like well i guess we're doing that because you as as dying as
[1045.04 --> 1050.88]  game stop is you can't just let your competitor have that type of deal because it would incentivize
[1050.88 --> 1056.96]  uh game stop to drastically push one console over the other so playstation is going to respond one
[1056.96 --> 1062.88]  quick thing i can just interject here is while the founders edition is not on a reference card uh there
[1062.88 --> 1071.20]  is reference boards and the 3080 and 3090 share reference board designs as confirmed by ek waterbox oh okay
[1071.20 --> 1081.12]  i wasn't sure who if anyone was using them though yeah i not entirely sure but um sweet sounds like
[1081.12 --> 1087.04]  there is at least a reference board yeah maybe the more basic cards that makes sense thanks for that
[1087.04 --> 1094.08]  um all right so back to back to our notes for this one here um now there are some more obvious benefits
[1094.08 --> 1099.04]  for microsoft that are part of the deal so gamestop will commit to use microsoft's cloud products and
[1099.04 --> 1105.84]  tablets in their stores as they announced last week and um there's some sort of analysis here that that
[1105.84 --> 1111.84]  could make microsoft look better to shareholders with cloud revenue from gamestop i don't know what
[1111.84 --> 1120.24]  kind of shareholders think they gamestop using a surface tablet as an employee device like matters at all but
[1121.20 --> 1128.80]  sure whatever floats your boat um for me honestly i think this is quite a bit simpler than
[1128.80 --> 1135.60]  some of the other takes that i've seen so far i think this is just even even if microsoft knew
[1135.60 --> 1141.84]  that sony was going to turn around and make the exact same deal making this pretty much status quo
[1141.84 --> 1145.92]  like on the one hand yeah like yeah microsoft they're going in there they're going to give a
[1145.92 --> 1151.52]  profit share to gamestop so that gamestop is going to push xbox really hard people are going to come in
[1151.52 --> 1155.76]  try and buy a playstation 5 they're gonna they're gonna hide them they're gonna lock them away they're
[1155.76 --> 1159.60]  gonna make them leave with an xbox like at the end of the day most gamers already know what they're
[1159.60 --> 1165.68]  walking in for and at the end of the day there's no way that sony wasn't going to counter a deal like
[1165.68 --> 1174.00]  this so if i'm microsoft um i probably i'm already playing i'm already playing 4d chess with sony at this
[1174.00 --> 1180.48]  point you know i'm so i'm looking two moves ahead 4d chess i already see that coming i know that my my
[1180.48 --> 1188.88]  cloud infrastructure whatever is a huge benefit for me with project x cloud um a row just way more
[1188.88 --> 1195.20]  robust system for uh digital content delivery all that kind of stuff more digital sales so i'm
[1195.20 --> 1201.20]  expecting a ton of digital sales i know that ultimately this is all going to be like a war of
[1201.20 --> 1207.04]  attrition and i know that if we're both making the same deal with gamestop i'm in a better position to
[1207.04 --> 1212.16]  deliver on this promise in the longer term it's going to actually cost me less the other thing
[1212.16 --> 1218.64]  that if i'm microsoft that i'm considering is like i don't actually want gamestop to go out of business
[1221.12 --> 1228.00]  think about that for a minute maybe i'm making this deal because i actually think it's a good thing
[1228.00 --> 1236.16]  for like how many stores does gamestop have like thousands maybe i think it's actually a good thing
[1236.72 --> 1242.56]  for remember we're talking consoles as a service is the way that mike's microsoft is going here maybe
[1242.56 --> 1248.80]  i think it's a good thing to instead of going and trying to you know build a network of carrier stores
[1248.80 --> 1255.92]  like the mobile device industry has done whether you're t-mobile or uh your verizon or at&t or whatever
[1255.92 --> 1261.76]  the case may be instead of doing that why don't i just basically take an infrastructure that already
[1261.76 --> 1268.08]  exists take a business model that we already know works where the store sells the hardware and then
[1268.08 --> 1274.24]  they get a recurring fee on any subscription revenue or any transactional revenue that so
[1274.24 --> 1279.52]  potentially this could be quite a generous fee and that keeps my distribution network alive
[1280.24 --> 1286.64]  not everyone is going to buy online not everyone there's even like there's there's even the value of
[1286.64 --> 1292.80]  like the the classic story where you you go to the you go to the mall with your partner and they
[1292.80 --> 1300.08]  want to go buy whatever and you're walking around bored and you just go buy an xbox game that's right
[1300.08 --> 1307.68]  every time that's right even if you don't buy something it's it's in microsoft's best interest
[1307.68 --> 1315.04]  for that store it's in microsoft and sony's best interest for that store to survive it's it's basically
[1315.04 --> 1322.72]  a marketing exercise a game stop to me if i'm microsoft a game stop is a free billboard yes actually
[1322.72 --> 1326.80]  it's like having having your game on the shelf or having your console on the shelf or behind the
[1326.80 --> 1333.92]  desk or whatever is super valuable if i walk into a game stop or it's uh eb games up here i'm usually
[1334.48 --> 1340.32]  not gonna buy something but i'm gonna look around and i'm gonna check like oh what what new games
[1340.32 --> 1345.44]  came out for like for switch or something because i don't really stay on top of the news for that
[1345.44 --> 1351.04]  but a whole shelf of games in front of me is very in my face when i'm bored in the mall looking for
[1351.04 --> 1355.52]  something to do and i might as well look at some games i'll often just like look at the wall of games
[1355.52 --> 1358.56]  and then see anything that looks interesting and then google it while i'm standing there
[1359.12 --> 1363.68]  and see if there's any like more details so like they they want these stores to survive so it's
[1363.68 --> 1369.68]  even if like it doesn't necessarily make a ton of financial sense in direct roi yeah it's great
[1369.68 --> 1376.96]  marketing exactly and like think about it if all microsoft wanted to do was sell xboxes at launch
[1376.96 --> 1383.44]  right well there's any number of partners you know there's there's your your best buy or there's i mean
[1383.44 --> 1389.12]  it's screw it you know when when demand is high for xboxes you know you could sell they could sell
[1389.12 --> 1395.52]  xboxes at corner stores and they would they would move through them all but name someone other than
[1395.52 --> 1402.32]  gamestop who's not going to be focused on something else six months later microsoft needs partners to
[1402.32 --> 1409.92]  still exist who are going to be pushing xbox in five years or six years when the xbox whatever
[1409.92 --> 1418.00]  completely bass backwards name they give it the next one is about to come out somebody when skyrim
[1418.00 --> 1424.40]  definitive long-term reach platinum edition gets launched nvidia needs our nvidia microsoft needs
[1424.40 --> 1430.72]  somebody to care about that and push the product so yeah so if i'm microsoft i don't want gamestop to
[1430.72 --> 1435.12]  go away i think it's that simple and back to what you were saying about gamestop being a store that you
[1435.12 --> 1440.88]  would just kind of wander into at the mall i challenge you you have uh i'm starting my timer
[1442.00 --> 1448.00]  oh boy in five seconds you have 30 seconds to name one other store in a mall that you would walk into go
[1453.76 --> 1462.96]  yeah i don't i don't know you got 20 more seconds go for it uh atmosphere atmosphere okay all right so
[1462.96 --> 1468.96]  outdoor outdoor like a really long time to remember the name but it has happened okay it has happened
[1468.96 --> 1475.52]  at least once but i i'm gonna start with game with uh eb games and then if i see everything and i'm like
[1475.52 --> 1480.08]  wow i it's just awkward that i'm still in this store i would wander around until i found atmosphere
[1481.04 --> 1485.28]  yep so you know what's funny i was actually at the mall with the wife we were trying to get some
[1485.28 --> 1490.00]  um she was helping me buy her a birthday present because i'm a pathetic terrible husband
[1492.48 --> 1499.92]  look she i knew she wanted clothes and there is no point buying a woman clothes without her just
[1499.92 --> 1505.28]  trying it on you did you did the right move so i wanted the kids to have something to give her
[1505.28 --> 1510.88]  we also did something homemade and thoughtful and she told me she was very impressed with the bubble
[1510.88 --> 1517.20]  letters that i drew on the kids card for them to color okay look bubble letters is not easy for me
[1517.20 --> 1524.40]  all right i did bubble letters she knew that was a stretch for me she recognized the effort i think
[1524.40 --> 1529.60]  i remember this for some reason we had to do bubble letters back when we we worked out of the old house
[1529.60 --> 1534.72]  and i remember there being like a whole thing about that yeah i had to do it or something because you and
[1534.72 --> 1540.88]  i both sucked bubble letters is not easy for me so anyway we we did the homemade thing and i i put in
[1540.88 --> 1546.64]  the actual like effort but i wanted the kids to just have like a gift to give her along with the card and so
[1547.20 --> 1554.72]  uh for the first time ever i bought something at lululemon which was interesting shorts are 60 canadian
[1554.72 --> 1561.84]  dollars so that's a thing yeah that's like 45 us dollars that's uh she she was like freaking out
[1561.84 --> 1567.92]  about it because she's like the i i i for the price of one of the we got two pairs of shorts so it was
[1567.92 --> 1574.32]  like 130 after tax and she was like for the price of one of these pairs of shorts i could completely
[1574.32 --> 1579.92]  replace like my entire bottom half like wardrobe at the price that i normally buy things at i'm like
[1579.92 --> 1587.60]  yeah but here's the thing hun um we found something that fits in a store that was nearby and we could
[1587.60 --> 1595.36]  either spend the next two hours walking around this mall or i could pay myself 60 an hour to go
[1595.36 --> 1600.80]  do something else and not still be shopping in this mall effectively but anyway it's probably more
[1600.80 --> 1606.72]  comfortable and it's a birthday thing and whatever the rest of that story is all right i don't know man
[1606.72 --> 1613.28]  the rest of that story is the one other store that i happened to walk into atmosphere hey because i was
[1613.28 --> 1619.04]  like oh this is kind of a cool looking store i didn't buy anything it's like whatever so we have
[1622.64 --> 1623.20]  that's great
[1625.92 --> 1631.76]  but i did walk into it i did walk into it we've got people like yeah i don't know i usually do like
[1631.76 --> 1638.48]  uh a like one kind of slow walk up and down every aisle ish and then just leave but yeah
[1638.48 --> 1650.56]  uh all right cool so uh float plane chad oh why don't shop to lululemon oh yeah i i don't i still
[1650.56 --> 1655.92]  for myself i still don't own a single lululemon garment yeah probably not james has been trying to
[1655.92 --> 1659.84]  get me to wear their clothes basically since the day he started he's like why do you dress like a
[1659.84 --> 1666.16]  homeless person like other than my ltt store stuff and i'm like well because ltt store hasn't made all of
[1666.16 --> 1671.76]  the products that i need to dress myself yet we're gonna have to just do joggers or something at some
[1671.76 --> 1676.80]  point so that i have pants to wear that are that i've actually i i think i have nothing to do with
[1676.80 --> 1681.12]  it so i don't know why people ask me so often but i think i've had more questions about when are you
[1681.12 --> 1687.04]  guys going to release some form of sweat pant than than any other potential products i've had that
[1687.04 --> 1692.32]  question a lot so part of the problem is that we have a lot of internal conflict over what type of
[1692.32 --> 1697.36]  pants to do jeans are basically going to be impossible for us as far as i can tell you need
[1697.36 --> 1704.00]  a team like yeah an enormous team of people to like figure out how to do jeans it is not simple
[1704.00 --> 1709.84]  it's a very difficult garment um so we're not doing that even though i'm a jeans wearer and i'd love it if
[1709.84 --> 1718.48]  we had like some really nice jeans um sweatpants were torn because nick and lloyd want to do something
[1718.48 --> 1724.40]  that's more like a trendy sweat pant like a jogger type pant and i'm like no if we're gonna do sweat
[1724.40 --> 1728.80]  pants let's do like some comfy sweat pants put like ltt across the bum you know what i'm talking about
[1728.80 --> 1735.68]  like nice that kind of sweatpants so basically as far as yeah as far as i can tell uh we have
[1735.68 --> 1743.44]  no sweatpants because lloyd refuses to design mine and i refuse to green light his so so we're at an impasse
[1743.44 --> 1751.84]  i was thinking like uh the the recent sweater non-hoodie thing yes just super similar to that
[1751.84 --> 1759.04]  like same color similar material but with ltt on the butt just just i was even thinking just like
[1759.04 --> 1765.36]  like same idea of the like really small branding but yeah okay nope nope big branding right across
[1765.36 --> 1770.88]  the butt that's that's what i want that's what i'm all that's what i'm all into here all right why
[1770.88 --> 1777.92]  don't we jump into our next topic um iphone 12 apple released new iphones the 12 12 mini 12 pro and
[1777.92 --> 1784.72]  12 pro max wow that's a lot of iphone all four variants will come with apple's new a14 bionic soc
[1784.72 --> 1789.28]  as far as i can tell this is the first five nanometer chip that is commercially available
[1789.28 --> 1796.88]  it's got six cpu cores about 17 faster than a13 and four gpu cores that are about 20 faster than a13
[1796.88 --> 1801.12]  so it should be the fastest phone on the market pretty much by a country mile not that that
[1801.68 --> 1807.28]  honestly makes much of a difference to me these days um other than my review of the new z fold 2
[1807.28 --> 1812.48]  i guess it's like new ish at this point i got it really late and i wanted it to be like uh like a
[1812.48 --> 1819.60]  really daily driving it review um so it's going to be even later so other than reviewing that which i
[1819.60 --> 1825.36]  don't think i'm going to be able to daily drive because youtube stories is still not fixed with it and
[1825.36 --> 1829.52]  there's like other bugs like every time i try and post to instagram at double posts and stuff like
[1829.52 --> 1834.96]  that um yeah so if not for that i'm still daily driving a note 9 which is like two-year-old phone
[1835.92 --> 1842.64]  has a 16 i'm still running a pixel 2xl heck yeah and yeah the pixel line is particularly
[1842.64 --> 1846.72]  interesting because they have not only peaked in terms of performance they're actually headed back
[1846.72 --> 1852.96]  down with the latest pixel 5. yeah i know you asked me a week or two ago and i'm i'm pretty
[1852.96 --> 1858.80]  i'm pretty solid on 4a 5g i need a new phone because my phone is like having notable issues
[1858.80 --> 1863.20]  like the proximity sensor and stuff i like i can't even have my sim in that phone anymore
[1863.20 --> 1867.52]  because i can't do phone calls but um but phone calls on a phone
[1868.96 --> 1878.00]  surely you mean playing raid shadow legends on a phone read shadow legons um so blah blah blah neural
[1878.00 --> 1883.20]  engine process 11 trillion operations per second all of them are 5g compatible with millimeter wave
[1883.20 --> 1889.28]  supported in the us and then sub 6 gigahertz globally has smart switching to save on battery
[1889.28 --> 1897.76]  life and magsafe is back that's pretty cool sort of i guess i i like magsafe yeah it's like a thing so
[1897.76 --> 1902.24]  here's something i find a little bit confusing about it do they really want me to put my phone like
[1902.24 --> 1909.68]  screen down on things because i don't like that i think they do because don't they have some usability
[1909.68 --> 1917.04]  features like screen down silences it or something um i mean that kind of stuff has existed for a long
[1917.04 --> 1921.76]  long time like i remember getting a briefing on like the galaxy s4 or something like that that had
[1921.76 --> 1927.84]  oh no yeah i'm just saying like like i think they do intend for you to have it faced uh screened
[1927.84 --> 1933.04]  down so i've just never given any f's about that because why on earth would you do that that is the
[1933.04 --> 1942.24]  fastest easiest way to scratch the heck out of your phone screen for no reason like just don't all it
[1942.24 --> 1950.08]  takes is one like micro grain of something and some idiot to like walk past and bump your phone and it to
[1951.20 --> 1957.76]  stretch across it and you've got like a gouge out of your screen like that's really dumb um so yeah
[1957.76 --> 1962.24]  it allows for perfect charge coil alignment which is pretty cool i i haven't played around with it
[1962.24 --> 1965.36]  yet maybe i'm going to play around with it and i'm going to be like this is so cool because the
[1965.36 --> 1971.52]  magnets are like hella strong and you'll be able to buy like desk mounted pads and you just like
[1971.52 --> 1977.20]  basically kind of chuck the phone towards it and it's like you know that it's like and it like lines
[1977.20 --> 1983.36]  up perfectly that'd be pretty cool like mag safe that would cause other issues perfect mating you know
[1983.36 --> 1990.08]  like mag safe condom magnets to get everything aligned you know you have a keyboard with like a
[1990.08 --> 1994.88]  a real nice plate in it and your keyboard just like slowly travels across your desk over time
[1995.52 --> 2001.04]  yeah probably not happening um the pro and the pro max have lidar sensors built into the camera array
[2001.04 --> 2005.76]  so that you can get better autofocus and dim conditions so that's pretty cool and for augmented
[2005.76 --> 2012.72]  reality oh speaking of augmented reality i will stop just doing my you know obligation of going through
[2012.72 --> 2017.60]  the iphone 12 launch information and i will talk about something actually exciting i got the new
[2017.60 --> 2026.16]  mario kart today oh nice nice and and because i'm never one to do it halfway uh well actually sometimes
[2026.16 --> 2032.32]  we do it halfway it's called short circuit um so we were debating james and i were going back and
[2032.32 --> 2037.84]  forth for probably like five minutes which channel does this thing go on if we were just going to unbox
[2037.84 --> 2044.64]  the one nintendo sent us and just like kind of try it for two minutes then short circuit if we were
[2044.64 --> 2051.20]  gonna like if we were gonna like i don't know run it through a car wash or something and see which one
[2051.20 --> 2058.32]  is the last one to outright die you know then it's channel super fun right sure if we were gonna try to
[2058.32 --> 2064.64]  you know stretch the limits of the technology and spend a bunch of time on it and like you know get four
[2064.64 --> 2071.60]  of them and do like a like an epic head-to-head race then it's still not really an ltt but boy is
[2071.60 --> 2078.24]  that a lot of work yeah so we decided to do an ltt anyway even though it's like kind of off topic for us
[2078.80 --> 2085.76]  and i've got a pretty epic prize that is going to make this video worth watching i think so james is
[2085.76 --> 2092.48]  going to work on the technical details of like you know making sure that there's an educational factor
[2092.48 --> 2097.12]  and but i mean nintendo's such a closed book i don't know how much or how little they're even
[2097.12 --> 2104.00]  going to share with us about you know how they got the latency so low or whatever right they might just
[2104.00 --> 2112.08]  be like the secret japanese engineering don't don't worry about it um so that's possible but we'll
[2112.08 --> 2118.08]  we'll get you guys whatever we can and then the tournament is going to be or we're going to do a
[2118.08 --> 2123.84]  grand prix obviously so we'll do a grand prix and i'll be racing against a few people who volunteered
[2123.84 --> 2129.52]  for the video today um and the winner is going to get three days vacation
[2131.92 --> 2140.16]  the runner-up will get one day vacation so with the stakes so high oh and if i win i don't i do not
[2140.16 --> 2147.76]  give out any vacation so even the runner-up doesn't get anything either uh the runner-up would get one
[2147.76 --> 2154.16]  yeah okay yeah so so someone will get something just go full i i love this because i'm not part of
[2154.16 --> 2159.84]  it so i can just say junk like this and everyone's gonna hate me including my bird uh but you just go
[2159.84 --> 2166.00]  full evil overlord and if you win just no one gets anything you're like you're the bowser of the race
[2166.00 --> 2175.84]  so uh yeah that's gonna be a lot of fun i'm really excited for it um spotty on floatplane asks paid
[2175.84 --> 2182.16]  vacation it's not vacation if you're not paid that's just that's just calling in sick i don't know like
[2182.88 --> 2189.84]  yeah uh so yeah it should be should be really fun um so everyone was allowed to take home their copy of
[2189.84 --> 2195.20]  the game we got four of them everyone was allowed to take it home for the weekend so you can bet that i will
[2195.20 --> 2203.36]  be practicing why don't you guys do multi-channel like you you could do a quick unboxing and look
[2204.00 --> 2209.36]  on short circuit you could do something on channel super fun where like there's like two teams or
[2209.36 --> 2216.00]  something and you have like three hours and you have to try to mod the the the racer to make it go
[2216.00 --> 2220.96]  faster or something and then have a drag race so that it's like not a as much of a time investment then
[2220.96 --> 2226.40]  you can have the big content on ltt like you don't have to it doesn't have to be one thing that's
[2226.40 --> 2230.48]  true we probably wouldn't do the channel super fun because we've got some kind of big ideas for that
[2230.48 --> 2234.88]  but you're probably right we probably should just do a short circuit unboxing and then follow it up with
[2234.88 --> 2240.72]  the mario one see if we can kind of like build some momentum you know like hey come see this over on
[2240.72 --> 2245.60]  ltt make sure you don't miss it because by the way in a week or something we'll have a deeper dive
[2245.60 --> 2249.28]  coming on the main channel like that i i think that would be cool and i would probably just watch
[2249.28 --> 2256.16]  both that's a pretty good idea um we should probably talk about our sponsors for the show today
[2257.84 --> 2262.72]  kind of got ahead of ourselves there a little bit hey so the show is brought to you today ladies and

[2400.80 --> 2404.32]  what i'm just i'm fooling around what do you want from me
[2406.16 --> 2413.36]  why don't you tell us about the amd motherboard with a soldered on a990 what is this thing this is
[2413.36 --> 2416.16]  weird i apparently it showed up on i think it was alibaba
[2418.56 --> 2427.04]  okay um and i as far as i know it is supposed to be the xbox one soc which is which is weird um
[2427.92 --> 2435.44]  i don't know why you would really want this so much anymore like an xbox one s like not a series s
[2435.44 --> 2442.48]  yeah not a series s so what microsoft just like a bunch of these chips fell off the back of a truck
[2442.48 --> 2451.20]  and so you can like i don't even understand what i'm looking at here like because the xbox one s and
[2451.20 --> 2460.24]  one x use gddr memory so does this chip that would have been custom built for those consoles does this
[2460.24 --> 2469.28]  chip also support regular what looks like ddr4 sorry i can't actually tell immediately from the notch here
[2469.28 --> 2476.40]  quite surprising uh okay so sorry walk us through what what else is going on here dr3
[2482.64 --> 2487.76]  loop dead it's weird it's weird i i i know i thought i had said something just a second ago but
[2487.76 --> 2494.24]  um it's i i don't i don't get not only why it exists but why you would really want it
[2494.24 --> 2498.64]  okay so what is it though
[2502.80 --> 2512.72]  seems to be what eight jaguar cores then um with an amd r7 350 gpu
[2512.72 --> 2525.04]  okay um maybe it's intended for like i i i i don't know i'm really i'm really struggling here
[2525.04 --> 2531.36]  because uh you're i think you're muted or something lute i'm trying to get my bird to go away i'm sorry
[2532.00 --> 2538.80]  no worries do you want me to just talk through this one no you're good you're good i i it's it's weird i
[2538.80 --> 2543.20]  i think the ultimate answer is like people don't really know um because there's there's debate about
[2543.20 --> 2549.52]  what it is there's some theory that it could be the the soc but uh the ram thing is weird like why
[2549.52 --> 2556.32]  would it exist in this configuration like maybe this is the board that they used in the um uh what
[2556.32 --> 2560.32]  are those the like the like dev boxes that people get before the console comes out
[2561.12 --> 2566.24]  um like maybe this is the board they were using in that for some reason uh that that could explain the
[2566.24 --> 2570.24]  ram thing like maybe this is just a really early version and they hadn't they hadn't fully converted
[2570.24 --> 2577.52]  over yet i don't know but um yeah unless some official information comes out and is like yes this is
[2577.52 --> 2583.52]  definitely that i could see some people wanting to like collect it for that reason but outside of that
[2583.52 --> 2592.80]  like i i don't why would why would you want this yeah um there's this chewy arrow box mini pc
[2592.80 --> 2600.08]  that uses a very similar motherboard to the xbox one s um so you know that's an example of what
[2600.08 --> 2606.00]  someone might do with a product like this like maybe they would try to you know build like a weird
[2606.00 --> 2614.16]  knockoff console or something i mean given how bad amd's jaguar cores are by modern standards
[2614.16 --> 2622.16]  i i would not expect performance to be very good at all but um like there's there's comments on this
[2622.16 --> 2628.00]  article of the the chewy arrow box like one of the first comments is given how god awfully the jaguar
[2628.00 --> 2635.84]  based am1 chips aged i'd avoid this like the plague with that said i think that's fairly well said with
[2635.84 --> 2644.32]  that said it's 125 us dollars for a motherboard cpu and gpu i mean the cp and gpu ain't anything special
[2644.32 --> 2651.28]  but you always got to look at things within the context of what else you can get for that price and
[2651.28 --> 2656.72]  you're looking at some pretty aging hardware for like that's it man you got to get one you got to
[2656.72 --> 2663.84]  do a build with it oh oh we've already got this on order 100 100 like we're we're gonna try it i bet
[2663.84 --> 2673.92]  the power consumption is just like terrible yeah i i don't i yeah i don't i would i would just go used
[2673.92 --> 2679.20]  at that point like if i was trying to build a a cheap computer i would just go used and probably
[2679.20 --> 2687.52]  get better stuff anyways um do you guys want to hear a uh a really weird conspiracy theory that
[2687.52 --> 2692.96]  i kind of feel like i shouldn't even talk about because i'm pretty sure it's nonsense uh let's have
[2692.96 --> 2699.52]  a look here though so this is posted by spartaman64 on the forum a redditor claimed nvidia's russia
[2699.52 --> 2708.88]  branch canceled the 30 series launch and scalped the gpus instead um according to the post the russian
[2708.88 --> 2714.56]  nvidia store like many others around the world sold out entirely within moments of going live except it
[2714.56 --> 2720.72]  wasn't actually sold the launch was allegedly cancelled before any cards were sold with um this user
[2721.44 --> 2728.00]  uh okay so this is over on nvidia.com being told that it was due to production failures with an
[2728.00 --> 2734.40]  indefinite weight let's go ahead and pull this up here yep there you go tech mob i think all the
[2734.40 --> 2741.12]  russian customers need an official explanation right now okay what else is going on here according
[2741.12 --> 2745.68]  to photos on russian social media the address the cards were shipped to matches the address of nvidia's
[2745.68 --> 2752.08]  russian distributor d house on launch day uh this combined with inappropriate call-outs and bragging on
[2752.08 --> 2756.48]  social media has led the claims that nvidia's russian arm or their distributors canceled the launch in
[2756.48 --> 2761.28]  order to provide influential or simply high paying customers with the cards at the expense of everyday
[2761.28 --> 2768.64]  customers in russia there's a lot of he said she said going on here and nvidia's official response is
[2768.64 --> 2774.56]  and this is machine translated from russian to english friends at the moment in russia as in the rest of
[2774.56 --> 2779.92]  the world the demand for geforce rtx 30 products significantly exceeds the available volume of goods
[2780.56 --> 2785.52]  i'll stop that now nvidia's online stores worldwide operate in reduced functionality mode and we're working
[2785.52 --> 2789.36]  with partners to improve product availability in the coming weeks we will share all the necessary
[2789.36 --> 2794.16]  information in our community stay tuned for updates thank you for your patience and understanding
[2795.68 --> 2797.76]  okay um
[2800.40 --> 2805.68]  hmm the thread and threads like it look like they've been subject to vote manipulation via bots so this is
[2805.68 --> 2812.32]  this is a proper mess whether or not this actually happened is uh definitely remains to be seen and
[2812.32 --> 2820.48]  it's possible we will never actually find out exactly what went down unless it's proven true i i think if
[2820.48 --> 2827.92]  if if it's not proven true it'll always just be this like weird thing that was i don't i don't suspect it
[2827.92 --> 2836.48]  will be proven false in other big news uh oneplus co-founder carl pay has left the company uh the statement
[2836.48 --> 2842.24]  said after nearly seven years at oneplus i've made the difficult decision to say goodbye pay who co-founded
[2842.24 --> 2848.16]  oneplus in late 2013 with pete lau has been the public face of the company since its launch and played
[2848.16 --> 2853.04]  an instrumental role in designing the oneplus smartphone lineup over the years and also uh how
[2853.04 --> 2858.40]  the company marketed itself android central speculated earlier this week that pay was leaving the firm
[2858.40 --> 2864.64]  because of an alleged internal power struggle between him and lau so lau took an additional role as
[2864.64 --> 2872.08]  senior vice president at oppo bbk group owns oppo realme oneplus and vivo and oneplus has always
[2872.08 --> 2877.60]  avoided questions about its ownership structure they kind of uh branded themselves as like a scrappy
[2877.60 --> 2882.72]  underdog even though it like didn't make any sense because no scrappy underdog can make a phone at a
[2882.72 --> 2889.04]  reasonable price and they like weren't for sure pay has said that he left the company because oneplus has
[2889.04 --> 2892.72]  been his singular focus for the last seven years it says he's looking forward to taking some time off to
[2892.72 --> 2899.68]  decompress and then he'll figure out what to do next um i actually uh kind of just my very limited
[2899.68 --> 2906.56]  experience with oneplus i kind of wonder if there's some truth to android's uh central speculation because
[2907.12 --> 2914.00]  i actually dealt with carl almost exclusively as the face of the company up until i would say about
[2915.20 --> 2921.28]  one and a half two years ago and then all of a sudden there was like a big sort of thing about
[2921.28 --> 2927.68]  uh pete lau doing his first keynote in english and then he all of a sudden it went from carl being
[2927.68 --> 2932.32]  the only one who was at events to pete was the only one at events and then now carl's gone it's like
[2932.32 --> 2940.48]  yeah okay sounds about right um but given that they've never really been very transparent about their
[2940.48 --> 2945.28]  their management and their ownership structure i don't think we'll ever get a better idea of what exactly
[2945.28 --> 2948.88]  the way that's going to be the only one at the end of the day that's going to be the only one of the
[2948.88 --> 2950.56]  the other things that are going to be the only one that's going to be the only one that's going to be
[2950.56 --> 2953.60]  that sounds credible enough to me though
[2956.96 --> 2961.44]  anything else you really wanted to get to this week there is one thing that i would really like to
[2961.44 --> 2968.32]  get to this week um not not only am i interested but i feel like if i didn't bring this up um
[2968.32 --> 2975.84]  then the line inspectives flow plane users would would disown me um the you applied at amazon story
[2975.84 --> 2982.96]  oh i'm sorry okay i will get to that in a moment first i have to give an update on the drive savers
[2983.60 --> 2993.60]  um drama okay yep yeah so i i do i do have to do that so last week basically what i said was hey look
[2993.60 --> 3001.04]  i haven't talked to jessa who claimed that drive savers took credit for her innovative workaround
[3001.04 --> 3008.88]  with an apple speaker i see that allowed a frozen phone to be temporarily booted all the data to be
[3008.88 --> 3015.20]  recovered and then restored to functionality through a reset she claimed that drive savers took credit in
[3015.20 --> 3021.52]  our sponsored video for her solution to that problem and i basically said okay so i'm finding out about
[3021.52 --> 3029.28]  this now i haven't spoken with jessa um but obviously that's a pretty serious allegation uh
[3029.28 --> 3037.12]  here's what she said here's what drive savers said um you know right now it's he said she said so i i
[3037.12 --> 3044.40]  can't really take a take a position here um what i did do in the week since the last one show is reach
[3044.40 --> 3050.24]  out to jessa she actually posted on our forum and i basically said like hey look um
[3050.24 --> 3057.60]  um these yeah these are these are pretty serious allegations and um it looks like you've got a
[3057.60 --> 3064.08]  pretty compelling story here but what i need in order to take real action on this is is some kind of
[3064.08 --> 3072.96]  proof um that what you say is true and what they say is not so what she's done is she's created a video
[3072.96 --> 3079.76]  about sort of the the points um of drive savers position on this that she disagrees with she's
[3079.76 --> 3084.56]  also created a post on the forum which we're going to have linked at the bottom of the video uh sorry
[3084.56 --> 3089.36]  unfortunately i don't have it there now so i'm going to add it right now and i'm going to see if
[3089.36 --> 3093.84]  that actually updates i'm going to have it right above where the time stamps are going to be there you
[3093.84 --> 3099.68]  go i've got that on youtube and oh no i don't have an easy way to update it on float plane right now but
[3099.68 --> 3103.52]  i'll add it later i'll add it later no i won't because there's no ancho archive doesn't matter
[3103.52 --> 3108.64]  the point is uh there's a link on youtube to her post over on the forum where basically
[3109.84 --> 3117.68]  in a nutshell i don't have any there's no smoking gun but i would say that there is a lot of
[3117.68 --> 3126.16]  circumstantial evidence if you kind of get what i mean so there's no there's no silver bullet there's
[3126.16 --> 3132.48]  no like hey this is the text message that they sent to me admitting that they stole my technique
[3133.20 --> 3140.88]  but there's a lot of uh there's a lot of claims that drive savers has made that don't seem to quite
[3140.88 --> 3146.56]  add up with respect to their in-house capabilities compared to the capabilities of third-party
[3146.56 --> 3152.88]  contractors that they use and it just kind of leads us to believe that um
[3152.88 --> 3159.92]  um you know there there may be something to jessa's story so as for what i'm going to do
[3160.40 --> 3167.68]  um so far we haven't heard from drive savers with any definitive proof one way or the other and we
[3167.68 --> 3173.12]  haven't heard from jessa with any definitive proof one way or the other so what we're going to do is
[3173.12 --> 3179.36]  we're going to leave the video up but we're going to do something that we are able to do under extremely
[3179.36 --> 3188.40]  um uh sort of exceptional circumstances and we are going to uh replace the video that is there
[3188.40 --> 3193.36]  with one that has an edit in it during the time when i'm talking about this technique that basically
[3193.36 --> 3199.52]  has text at the bottom that says jessa jones uh from i have ipad rehab says that this is actually her
[3199.52 --> 3204.00]  technique and we're going to have a link in the video description to where you can read through
[3204.00 --> 3211.60]  um you know her statement about you know why uh why you should believe her side of the story and then
[3211.60 --> 3218.32]  what we're going to do moving forward is honestly i just can't deal with this kind of uh he said she
[3218.32 --> 3227.44]  said nonsense um my life is a drama free zone so if i can't um if i can't operate under an assumption that
[3227.44 --> 3231.84]  sponsors and members of the community are all able to be straight with me
[3231.84 --> 3237.60]  uh then we're just not going to work with any data recovery companies moving forward at all
[3238.16 --> 3244.72]  um you know i just i have no way of validating who's telling yeah i have no way of validating
[3245.60 --> 3251.52]  just a hundred percent unequivocally who is telling me the truth and this is one of those things that i
[3251.52 --> 3258.16]  just cannot afford to have our company dragged through the mud over because someone is being disingenuous so
[3258.16 --> 3266.32]  that's um that's my commitment i've already told that to jessa and um i've asked um i've asked the
[3266.32 --> 3271.52]  business team to pass that along to drive savers um i've already i told jessa actually that i might
[3271.52 --> 3277.04]  make one exception for that um or two exceptions i guess i told her that i would be open to doing a
[3277.04 --> 3284.88]  collab so not promoting her business or or drive or device recovery you know or anything like that but
[3284.88 --> 3290.00]  just youtuber to youtuber i'd love to do a collab like maybe just fixing something together um kind
[3290.00 --> 3295.68]  of like what we did with lewis rossman in the past and then if deep spar ever came back to us and wanted
[3295.68 --> 3300.48]  to do another video i think we would work with deep spar again just because there was there was zero
[3300.48 --> 3308.32]  drama um they're fantastic they're so cool um i love what they do um and the the feedback from our
[3308.32 --> 3313.60]  community was overwhelmingly positive for the tool that we were promoting last time we worked with them
[3313.60 --> 3323.28]  uh it was a tool that basically used like um a cloud connection where because you can only like you can
[3323.28 --> 3328.72]  only test the characteristics of so many failing hard drives a hard drive has to fail in order for you to
[3329.36 --> 3335.84]  uh in order for you to perform analytics on it and you know observe its behavior so what deep spar built was
[3335.84 --> 3344.00]  this tool that uh you can use to take like uh uh like to record the characteristics of the failing
[3344.00 --> 3348.64]  drive that you have or the failed drive that you have and compare it to other drives that were failing
[3348.64 --> 3354.48]  or failed and help you determine what the problem is and then it would add that data to their collective
[3354.48 --> 3361.20]  data on their servers so that other people could benefit from it making it like kind of a a a tool that
[3361.20 --> 3365.76]  gets better and better the more people in the data recovery community use it it was like super cool
[3365.76 --> 3370.32]  idea and apparently it ended up selling really well our feedback from our community was really good so
[3370.32 --> 3374.56]  we would work with them again but beyond that we're just we're just not going to do it anymore i don't
[3374.56 --> 3381.36]  need that drama in my life it feels almost like uh i don't even remember their names but those two
[3381.36 --> 3386.96]  brothers that just like make fake drama on youtube constantly oh yeah i'm not gonna say their names i heard
[3386.96 --> 3392.00]  if you say that in too much they appear they have three times in the mirror that way that that the
[3392.00 --> 3397.20]  other thing too is that as long as i don't mention any names then uh i have plausible deniability for
[3397.20 --> 3405.44]  it being any two brothers so yeah two two brothers and there's grandmas and they fight them and there's a
[3406.00 --> 3411.60]  meteor coming towards the earth two brothers yeah it should be it should be fine
[3411.60 --> 3418.96]  youtuber drama is probably much more interesting to youtubers than to ltd viewers uh says last digit of
[3418.96 --> 3429.36]  pi yeah yeah probably yep um no it is not like the old annotations so we would have to it's a whole it's
[3429.36 --> 3436.16]  a whole thing uh wait what why is ltd's name ruined what are you guys even talking about in float plane chat
[3436.16 --> 3442.00]  i think i think we're okay i think we're uh i i think we're i think we're pretty good i think we're
[3442.00 --> 3447.76]  pretty good on uh on that all right well i think that's pretty much it other than i should probably
[3447.76 --> 3452.32]  have a look at a couple of super chats i saw a couple of big ones come in i need to make sure i
[3452.32 --> 3457.92]  at least hit those al baker says many wang shows ago linus asked whether he should play final fantasy
[3457.92 --> 3462.80]  six with a mod which both fixes bugs and ups the difficulty oh yeah i played through about half the game
[3462.80 --> 3469.68]  um it was okay it was different um yeah it was all right wait are you starting super chats yeah no
[3470.80 --> 3478.00]  what why i supplied at amazon linus applied at amazon right at amazon okay all right all right all right
[3478.00 --> 3485.12]  all right all right oh okay all right all right all right all right so back when i had already decided
[3485.12 --> 3491.68]  to leave ncix but i hadn't actually i think the way the timeline goes is that i hadn't actually told
[3491.68 --> 3497.60]  them that i was going to be leaving yet um i wanted to explore my options so that i would have some
[3497.60 --> 3504.96]  idea of how strong my negotiating position was going to be because my plan i had already sought legal
[3504.96 --> 3512.40]  advice to determine whether or not the linus tech tips channel could be argued belonged to me um i was
[3512.40 --> 3519.60]  going to make the argument that it's in my name and therefore was treated um at ncix as sort of a
[3519.60 --> 3524.72]  personal project i was going to make the argument that i did a lot of the work on it on my own time
[3525.36 --> 3533.52]  i informed the lawyer that i uh was compensated for that time but not at like an above minimum wage
[3533.52 --> 3542.64]  rate necessarily um because the amount that i was compensated for per video was like i think accounted
[3542.64 --> 3547.84]  for like maybe an hour and change of time but a lot of the videos took much much longer than that
[3547.84 --> 3553.84]  plus if it wasn't significantly better than mine than it then it was it wasn't very good yeah so
[3555.36 --> 3560.80]  um basically i gave a lawyer all this information they went no i think with all that in mind it's
[3560.80 --> 3566.56]  the intellectual property of ncix you you have no real claim to make here and i was like okay that's
[3566.56 --> 3574.16]  fair and it was worth finding out um so what i had decided was i wanted it and i needed to figure out a way to
[3574.16 --> 3582.88]  uh what what chips i could offer in return and i thought that if it was as simple as
[3583.68 --> 3591.20]  okay well you can either give it to me or i can go work for your competitor um they would give it to me
[3592.00 --> 3599.12]  and the way that i saw it because you know one of my ideas for uh surviving back then was that ncix should
[3599.12 --> 3605.68]  um revise their business model to be more like actually very similar to what amazon does with
[3605.68 --> 3610.88]  their with their drop points now or i forget what they're branded where you just like have something
[3610.88 --> 3616.80]  shipped to like a drop box and you just go pick it up yeah yeah local pickups um i wanted ncix to shift
[3616.80 --> 3621.12]  to a model where we had like these little tiny hole in the wall stores that were basically not a
[3621.12 --> 3625.84]  storefront at all like we could have a service section if we wanted to because that's fairly lucrative
[3625.84 --> 3631.60]  even in a small town and then just kind of like a small warehouse in the back and then we would only
[3631.60 --> 3636.56]  stock like the two most popular items from each category so if someone really did want to come in
[3636.56 --> 3640.56]  and configure a custom computer then you could configure a custom computer as long as it used
[3641.20 --> 3647.76]  kingston ram in this speed and one of two capacities and like you know what i mean like it's like
[3647.76 --> 3652.32]  probably mostly just beneficial to the service center so that they have something to like throw in
[3652.32 --> 3656.88]  when they pretty much and then other than that we would just have trucks that went back and forth
[3656.88 --> 3663.04]  across the country so that every you know two to three days um one of the one of the big warehouses
[3663.04 --> 3667.92]  would have a transfer going out to each one and people across the country would be able to get items
[3669.44 --> 3673.52]  in just like a couple of days without paying for shipping because it would be we would just kind
[3673.52 --> 3677.92]  of absorb that as part of our cost of doing business apparently they're called amazon lockers so
[3677.92 --> 3683.36]  anyway that was one of my ideas um ncix didn't really seem to see amazon as the big threat which
[3683.36 --> 3689.84]  is hilarious to me now because amazon is a monster in pc hardware even though their site is horrendous for
[3689.84 --> 3697.28]  finding it and um so i thought that one of the things that i could do to strengthen my negotiating position
[3698.16 --> 3704.16]  and or just make sure that i was able to make money after i was no longer working at ncix if they
[3704.16 --> 3708.96]  didn't ultimately give me the channel because i was going to leave no matter what was uh to try to
[3708.96 --> 3713.52]  get a job at amazon and i knew from talking to people who had applied there that getting a job
[3713.52 --> 3720.96]  there was like notoriously difficult um there's like this whole long interview process and it's like a
[3720.96 --> 3726.56]  bunch of interviews and like they won't even look at you if you don't have certain credentials and so
[3727.28 --> 3733.60]  i did find a job that i thought was right up my alley and it was like a social media coordinator and i was
[3733.60 --> 3740.16]  like oh wow yeah i mean i don't have the bachelor's degree that they say they want but boy do i ever
[3740.16 --> 3745.92]  have a fair bit of experience in social media which remember guys this was eight years ago this was
[3745.92 --> 3753.04]  before you know every zoomer and their dog had you know uh a weird throwaway instagram account where
[3753.04 --> 3758.80]  they repost memes with like you know a hundred thousand followers or whatever um having social media
[3758.80 --> 3767.84]  like like like proven social media success was kind of a big deal and so i had i had uh my twitter
[3767.84 --> 3776.48]  account i had uh these two youtube channels that had significant followings and i applied and um
[3778.24 --> 3786.72]  i mean that's kind of the end of the story amazon had an opportunity to hire me and did not even reply to
[3786.72 --> 3794.00]  my application presumably because i didn't have the right credentials even though if they knew what
[3794.00 --> 3799.44]  the right credentials were for a social media coordinator they would have recognized them on
[3799.44 --> 3808.56]  my resume in fact if you look at my linkedin uh linkedin i don't remember all the conversations from back
[3808.56 --> 3817.20]  then there was a lot um if you didn't get the channel what would you have done would you have
[3817.20 --> 3824.80]  started a new channel right so ultimately what i what i had what i told ncix was that i would go to
[3824.80 --> 3831.12]  memory express who i did have an offer from um or i would go move down south and i would go work at
[3831.12 --> 3839.60]  new egg and new egg and memory express for um just sort of like emotional reasons i think were a lot
[3839.60 --> 3844.00]  more effective anyway like i don't think they would have understood that amazon was the threat that it was
[3844.64 --> 3849.52]  yeah uh and so ultimately we did get the channel as for what i would have done if we didn't get the
[3849.52 --> 3856.88]  channel oh man um i would have been okay uh wd offered me a job a little while after with the team
[3856.88 --> 3862.48]  that i think ended up getting dissolved so i don't know how long that would have lasted but as for you
[3862.48 --> 3867.36]  guys i don't know i don't know what the heck you and ed would have done yeah ed and i were kind of
[3867.36 --> 3873.12]  like suicide-packed on that plan at that point i think what we would have had to do is start the
[3873.12 --> 3880.00]  channel fresh and we would have just had to eat a lot more macaroni and cheese honestly i don't
[3880.00 --> 3886.48]  necessarily think it would have been that bad the first man we had 200 000 subscribers when we started
[3886.88 --> 3892.64]  and 200 000 subscribers back then was a lot more than it is now and i guess you probably wouldn't
[3892.64 --> 3896.88]  have been able to get away with like posting a video saying that you were going somewhere else but
[3896.88 --> 3902.80]  i just i think a lot of people would have followed is all i'm i'm really saying um like even back then
[3902.80 --> 3908.40]  like the community was so much smaller and so much more tight-knit like you'd see the same people
[3908.40 --> 3913.68]  commenting on videos across the board because we just really honestly didn't get that many views back
[3913.68 --> 3918.96]  then that's true and the forum would have helped us with that but i think if i recall correctly when
[3918.96 --> 3922.96]  we started like it definitely would have been harder but yeah we wouldn't have had the domain
[3922.96 --> 3927.60]  even like we wouldn't have had linustech tips.com we'd have had to completely rebrand and remember
[3927.60 --> 3935.04]  too that youtube's discoverability was not as good back then like nowadays we can start a new channel
[3935.04 --> 3940.48]  make a video and the fact that it has my face in the thumbnail all of a sudden instead of getting
[3940.48 --> 3948.32]  four views it's getting 40 000 views because the algorithm knows so it just wasn't that
[3948.32 --> 3953.28]  sophisticated back then i think it would have been really tough i i think it would have been doable i
[3953.28 --> 3958.16]  definitely i i agree with the like we'd be i don't remember exactly how you said it eating macaroni or
[3958.16 --> 3962.00]  eating crafting or whatever longer but i still think it would have been i still think it would have been
[3962.00 --> 3968.96]  possible um so if you guys want to see what my resume looked like that i that i sent to amazon it's
[3968.96 --> 3975.92]  basically my linkedin profile the one thing that's new now is that i have founder linus media group inc
[3976.80 --> 3983.84]  and i don't even know what that looks like i haven't seen mine in so long yeah so this is great about
[3983.84 --> 3989.20]  i am a self-driven social media enthusiast with extensive experience and success on youtube in the
[3989.20 --> 3995.76]  past seven years i have built multiple channels that now total 2 million subscribers and 200 million views
[3995.76 --> 4006.40]  wow linus that is you know that that's very impressive good job young boy um actually inaccurate now
[4008.64 --> 4009.12]  rough
[4011.92 --> 4017.20]  i i saw someone posted a tweet the other day that ended up getting a lot of traction where they said they
[4017.20 --> 4023.44]  they updated their twitter bio before they updated their linkedin and that should say a lot about like
[4023.44 --> 4028.24]  what the current like uh like hiring and recruitment space looks like and i'm like
[4029.44 --> 4034.32]  you know yeah to be honest like i haven't heard the last time anyone cared about linkedin at all
[4034.32 --> 4040.08]  you know what i don't know because i get a lot of messages and stuff on linkedin from people that are
[4040.08 --> 4044.00]  like wow i had no idea how to get in touch with you and i like i'm trying to get in touch with you here
[4044.00 --> 4047.52]  and what do you have no idea to get in how to get in touch with me the email is literally on the about
[4047.52 --> 4054.40]  tab on the youtube channel like what are you talking about um maybe feel really big with a certain
[4054.40 --> 4063.20]  demographic or something boomers yep because it was super popular around that time like that that would
[4063.20 --> 4069.68]  have been 2012 2013 and it was it was huge back then i mean people thought it was very very professional
[4069.68 --> 4076.72]  it's a big business now though like yeah i don't know man oh man i love my i love my profile
[4076.72 --> 4084.40]  i i put like the least amount of effort possible into my linus media group entry linus media group
[4084.40 --> 4089.60]  is committed to what is this is committed to delivering fun engaging social media and video
[4089.60 --> 4094.40]  marketing solutions that's what i wrote seven years and ten months ago and i have never touched it again
[4096.88 --> 4101.84]  your ncix entries are like so long and well written out i i feel like i remember
[4101.84 --> 4109.92]  you and von working on these uh no i did this uh i'm i'm going to be totally honest with you um
[4110.48 --> 4116.16]  i actually did this oh i must have contacted amazon after i had to after i had told ncix i was leaving
[4116.16 --> 4121.68]  then because i remember working on this at work while i was just like checked out and had already told
[4121.68 --> 4126.56]  them that i was leaving and my main job was just to like be there and answer questions for my replacement
[4126.56 --> 4133.12]  so i didn't really have anything to do so that must be the order of operations scroll down look at your
[4133.12 --> 4140.56]  publication section publications yeah what are publications you have to get below education you
[4140.56 --> 4146.64]  have to get all the way down the three publications fast as possible linus tech tips and ncix tech tips
[4146.64 --> 4152.40]  look at the descriptions too though fast informative videos about technology youtube video blog sponsored
[4152.40 --> 4158.64]  by ncix developed and hosted by yours truly flagship youtube channel for ncix.com developed
[4158.64 --> 4167.76]  administrated and hosted by me what a nerd why am i such a nerd so we both have just like flagrantly
[4167.76 --> 4175.44]  false information on our linkedin i love that i have one recommendation one single recommendation on
[4175.44 --> 4181.12]  linkedin from uh from taran so for those of you who don't know who taran is i i totally get it
[4181.12 --> 4190.32]  you know who is that guy uh so he works at uh he works as director of sales at corsair uh for north america
[4190.32 --> 4199.36]  and he was my uh so he was for the latter part of my ncix career he was like my boss but then he was gone
[4199.36 --> 4204.32]  and that was one of the reasons that i ultimately decided to leave because he was sort of a voice of sanity
[4204.32 --> 4210.96]  in the chaos and the fact that he was gone i was like oh that this sucks um so yeah he was the one who
[4210.96 --> 4215.60]  was there for the roast and i had wanted him there not because his public speaking was amazing as far
[4215.60 --> 4220.32]  as i knew he did a great job though um i had wanted him there just because i wanted someone who knew me
[4220.32 --> 4226.48]  as a as a young professional and i use the term professional very loosely um his his recommendation
[4226.48 --> 4231.12]  he wrote me on linkedin is very nice though it's more reflective of his later experience with me i
[4231.12 --> 4237.92]  suspect i remember him telling me at some point on like a business trip like you know you need to learn to just shut up sometimes
[4237.92 --> 4242.80]  some peace and quiet would be nice
[4246.40 --> 4252.08]  i don't know i was just i was just jazzed i was like we never hang out he's like yeah well why do you think
[4252.08 --> 4257.12]  that is now we do whenever we get a chance but it's tough because he lives down in the states
[4257.84 --> 4264.24]  that's funny oh boy all right so let's do a couple more okay hopefully the story lived up to your
[4264.24 --> 4270.80]  expectations let's do a couple more super chats npgrx says in a youtube story you showed a 3090
[4270.80 --> 4275.76]  tricks with an ek water block totally loved the look of a backplate uh it was an it was an ek one it was a
[4275.76 --> 4286.72]  mirror ek one um let's see you're super blue luke uh there's a comment from uh yeah i can't really

[4327.60 --> 4331.76]  money buying my wife underwear she won't wear i might as well spend the money to support you guys
[4332.56 --> 4339.84]  okay so we have tentatively greenlit the project there's just there's so many people asking about it'll
[4339.84 --> 4346.08]  be a small production run but we're gonna put the work into it we're gonna do it pretty much guarantee
[4346.08 --> 4353.12]  you it's gonna sell out immediately we're we're gonna do it we're gonna do it um as uh actually i
[4353.12 --> 4359.28]  think i might have convinced ivan to let me upload the vlog that we shot making that one-off pair that
[4359.28 --> 4366.32]  she has it's pretty funny because we like made a lot of mistakes and stuff like that so sorry
[4367.12 --> 4370.72]  floatplane exclusive floatplane exclusive i was actually gonna put it on the linus cat tips channel
[4370.72 --> 4374.56]  i could put it up early on the plane though that works because i was thinking like where else would
[4374.56 --> 4380.72]  you put that yeah yeah but maybe maybe cat tips makes sense channel says about ways to support phone
[4380.72 --> 4388.48]  os is longer uh 15 fairphone 2 shipped with android 5.1 now has 7.1 despite no soc support and it has a
[4388.48 --> 4394.40]  beta for nine could mean support till 2022 to finance it the phone is super repairable spare equals
[4394.40 --> 4401.04]  revenue and a bit overpriced yeah that's a that's a fair way to attack that uh theorica says not much
[4401.04 --> 4408.00]  to say hope you and all at lmg are great oh and fp is still upset luke did not talk like a pirate when
[4408.00 --> 4413.36]  the bird was perched on his shoulder last week next time r what do you think luke are you gonna do it
[4413.36 --> 4419.28]  are you gonna talk like a pirate i'm really bad at that kind of stuff um and it would probably be super
[4419.28 --> 4428.08]  annoying um but i don't know maybe my morning i'm having the bird randomly come to visit me but i
[4428.08 --> 4433.20]  don't want it to like take over the show my morning woo says my girlfriend finally gave me permission to
[4433.20 --> 4438.64]  build a new pc i'm waiting for the ryzen 5900x and i'm gonna pair it with an rtx 3080 you better get on
[4438.64 --> 4447.68]  that rtx 3080 give it a yeah good luck uh the daily dan says can't you compromise on the pants and
[4447.68 --> 4453.68]  make regular pants that normal people will wear but include an iron-on ltt butt patch for people
[4453.68 --> 4463.92]  like linus that's not a bad idea daily dan that's not a bad idea um jerry says you know amazon has
[4463.92 --> 4468.80]  expert installation on their electronics including computer hardware uh what if you unlike lyle build
[4468.80 --> 4473.76]  an entire pc this way uh we had actually considered doing that i can't get down to the states right now
[4473.76 --> 4479.84]  and i don't think they offer the service in canada so yes it is actually on our list of stuff to do it's
[4479.84 --> 4485.20]  just it's really hard to do it right now alex the psychotherapist says i wanted to say i'm a huge fan
[4485.20 --> 4488.88]  i love your work i hope you keep up the good work what happened between you and madrinus it seems their
[4488.88 --> 4495.60]  whole company is going under so i don't know anything about that drama um madrina's coffee
[4495.60 --> 4505.52]  going under i don't know what is this backup of about madrina's coffee are they shop uh cold brew coffee
[4506.56 --> 4514.08]  can you okay as far as i can tell you can just like buy stuff uh i mean i could be wrong ncix's site was
[4514.08 --> 4517.76]  up and running and you could like buy stuff up until the very end uh
[4520.72 --> 4527.44]  i don't know i mean we didn't cut them off i'll say that much but we clearly don't get sponsorship
[4527.44 --> 4533.84]  from them anymore so i guess they don't like us because we're bad people i don't know i don't know
[4533.84 --> 4541.60]  their twitter's still active like i i have no idea ninth praise says why did you buy the domain ufd
[4541.60 --> 4547.60]  store.com robbing ufd tech of their store seems a bit shady that you did that are you an idiot
[4550.80 --> 4558.16]  do you know ufd at all like there's brett bought ufd store.com and redirected it to ltt store i didn't
[4558.16 --> 4566.80]  do that sheesh all right well i think that's it for today um
[4566.80 --> 4574.64]  live bacteria asks do you know who the yogs cast are completely random question i i guess i've heard
[4574.64 --> 4580.00]  of them there you go oh oh no uh hi
[4580.00 --> 4599.76]  oh oh snap apparently we did buy it uh okay well that's good to know but we have offered to give it
[4599.76 --> 4607.84]  to brett so whenever he wants it we'll give it to him okay uh okay maybe we shouldn't do that next time

[4638.80 --> 4645.20]  this is why i tend to be a little bit more forgiving you know when intel has some scandal where
[4645.20 --> 4650.32]  the marketing people say something that the engineers obviously wouldn't agree with um because
[4650.32 --> 4656.16]  i'm like yeah it's probably just someone doing something and like people who know better don't know
[4656.16 --> 4663.04]  about it um i i believe that that's a thing that could happen what a beautiful example oh my goodness
[4663.60 --> 4666.96]  oh man you and i both were like that's dumb
[4669.28 --> 4673.84]  wow i think i called that super chatter an idiot even though they gave me like five dollars
