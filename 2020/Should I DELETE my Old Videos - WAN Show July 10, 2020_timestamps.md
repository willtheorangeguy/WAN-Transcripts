1) Not only should you not delete old videos, it would be cowardly to do so. If you're really worried about maybe having said problematic things in them, you should go through, write titles and timestamps, and apologize for things that have been said

2) The problem with joking about Luke's dyslexia isn't that he could be hurt by it, but that when you joke about something like that in a public space, you're saying that it's something to be derided, which is of course bad, and of course going to hurt people.

3) The standards for what is problematic are pretty consistent: Don't harm people.
