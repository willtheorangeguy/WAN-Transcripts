[0.00 → 7.44] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to The WAN Show, the only weekly tech news show where tech news is more of a side dish.
[9.18 → 14.90] But we have some delicious sides today. AMD Big Nazi is coming.
[15.58 → 20.06] And it actually looks like pretty good. Looks pretty good.
[21.40 → 24.20] Should I let AMD get me excited about graphics?
[24.90 → 26.06] Because like...
[26.06 → 26.52] Why not?
[26.94 → 28.12] What do you mean why not?
[28.12 → 28.58] Welcome to Team Red TV.
[28.58 → 32.06] What do you mean why not? Because Team Red? Team Red TV.
[32.32 → 36.22] It's so hot. It's so hot. It burned me so many times.
[36.40 → 38.28] I was thinking, you know how I do Pokémon computers?
[39.46 → 39.90] Yes.
[40.48 → 41.56] I was thinking Charmander.
[41.62 → 45.90] You're thinking Charm... You had a Charmander before already. You can't reuse Pokémon.
[46.18 → 48.60] There's like 8 billion Pokémon now.
[49.32 → 50.52] Yeah, but only Gen 1 matters.
[50.60 → 53.04] No, I don't even want to hear about it. No, no, forget it.
[53.04 → 56.04] Intel officially reveals more Rocket Lake details.
[56.04 → 60.44] There's more Rocket Lake details. Hopefully they're good details.
[60.56 → 63.10] Otherwise, oh boy, big trouble. What else we got?
[63.60 → 67.26] Oculus Quest 2 was jailbroken. Get freaking wrecked.
[67.82 → 69.70] There's also... Oh, okay. This note is in there.
[69.78 → 70.68] There was like bounties.
[71.36 → 73.76] There were bounties, and they were placed by Palmer.
[74.02 → 75.92] Lucky, which is hilarious.
[75.92 → 79.62] Oh my God.
[79.80 → 84.18] Also, 10,000 PPI display.
[84.60 → 89.32] What? A 10,000 PPI display?
[89.64 → 91.38] You don't have a 10,000 PPI.
[91.48 → 92.38] That is so much PPI.
[93.12 → 95.06] You have no idea how much PPI I have.
[95.30 → 97.40] You'd be amazed at my PPI.
[97.40 → 102.70] You sent PPI the whole computer, and he didn't rate it.
[103.10 → 104.02] So, I don't know.
[105.24 → 106.04] Impossible to know.
[107.10 → 108.88] Apparently that computer is working again.
[109.70 → 109.90] Oh.
[110.30 → 110.56] Yeah.
[111.32 → 112.40] PewDiePie dropped into...
[113.22 → 114.70] Or, I don't know, someone who works for him.
[114.86 → 117.78] Someone from the official actual handle
[117.78 → 121.64] dropped into one of my live streams a little while ago
[121.64 → 122.40] and was like,
[122.48 → 124.42] Oh, hey, by the way, the creeper PC is working out.
[124.90 → 125.66] And I was like, what?
[126.34 → 127.94] And they never replied again.
[128.08 → 128.78] And I was like, okay.
[129.26 → 130.48] Maybe that was actually...
[130.48 → 131.36] Maybe that was him.
[131.58 → 131.74] Yeah.
[132.34 → 133.72] Because if it was like a subordinate,
[133.84 → 135.44] they probably would have hung around for a little bit
[135.44 → 136.70] and like interacted.
[137.48 → 137.74] Yeah.
[138.38 → 140.12] Why don't we jump right into Big Nazi?
[140.12 → 142.12] Because that is the big...
[142.12 → 143.56] The big...
[143.56 → 145.80] Big energy this week.
[146.64 → 148.12] AMD has finally...
[148.12 → 148.52] I mean, yeah.
[148.80 → 149.92] Yeah, it is.
[149.92 → 151.74] AMD has finally revealed
[151.74 → 154.40] their first add-in graphics cards
[154.40 → 157.40] featuring their RDNA 2 technology.
[157.82 → 160.54] Big Nazi really is way more fun to say, though.
[160.94 → 163.60] RDNA 2 is the same graphics technology
[163.60 → 164.76] that is to be found
[164.76 → 167.08] in the upcoming next generation consoles,
[167.22 → 168.06] the PlayStation 5
[168.06 → 171.32] and the Xbox Series S and Series X.
[171.70 → 173.20] But obviously,
[173.20 → 175.36] these are the high-end PC versions
[175.36 → 177.00] and it looks like,
[177.10 → 178.28] at least on the surface,
[178.28 → 180.90] they are going to absolutely mop the floor
[180.90 → 182.00] with the console versions
[182.00 → 183.94] as long as you've got the money
[183.94 → 185.50] to pay to play
[185.50 → 187.58] because they ain't going to be cheap.
[187.66 → 188.00] Although,
[188.36 → 189.36] with what NVIDIA has done
[189.36 → 190.72] with high-end graphics card pricing
[190.72 → 192.76] over the last five years or so,
[193.24 → 193.66] I mean,
[193.86 → 194.16] hey,
[194.94 → 196.94] $1,000 for a graphics card?
[197.38 → 198.94] That sounds pretty good,
[198.98 → 199.44] doesn't it?
[199.70 → 200.64] What a great deal.
[200.64 → 202.80] It's all about what you're used to, right?
[203.00 → 204.32] It's what you're used to.
[204.56 → 205.60] So the lineup is
[205.60 → 207.42] the Radeon RX 6800,
[207.94 → 209.26] which AMD says
[209.26 → 211.80] will be faster than an RTX 3070
[211.80 → 213.42] at $579,
[213.56 → 215.50] and the 3070 is around $499.
[215.86 → 216.04] That,
[216.14 → 217.88] hmm,
[217.96 → 219.24] that is probably going to be
[219.24 → 220.76] the least competitive in the lineup.
[220.90 → 222.42] It's got 60 compute units,
[222.56 → 224.12] 1.8 gigahertz game clock,
[224.22 → 225.22] 2.1 gig boost,
[225.36 → 226.46] so if your water cooling,
[226.56 → 228.62] you might get a fair bit more performance,
[228.62 → 232.14] and 16 gigs of GDDR6 non-X,
[232.34 → 234.10] and that is a 250-watt card.
[234.54 → 234.80] Then,
[234.88 → 236.22] if you step up to the XT,
[236.76 → 237.18] honestly,
[237.32 → 239.40] the 6800 and 6800 XT
[239.40 → 242.28] sound so different in performance
[242.28 → 243.66] that it kind of surprises me
[243.66 → 246.18] that it's not like a 6700,
[246.42 → 247.50] 6800 move.
[247.50 → 247.60] Yeah,
[247.78 → 249.20] they probably shouldn't have done
[249.20 → 250.42] the XT moniker thing.
[250.66 → 252.22] I strongly agree with that.
[252.56 → 252.92] It's not,
[252.96 → 253.60] it's not like,
[253.72 → 253.86] oh,
[253.96 → 254.12] this,
[254.26 → 254.54] like,
[254.82 → 255.12] yeah,
[255.30 → 256.80] it's not a little bump.
[256.98 → 258.14] It's very significant.
[258.14 → 260.46] It's still 16 gigs of GDDR6,
[260.64 → 262.52] so no GDDR6X
[262.52 → 263.86] like NVIDIA's been using,
[264.00 → 265.22] and no HBM memory,
[265.46 → 265.58] which,
[266.04 → 266.96] poor AMD,
[267.56 → 267.74] like,
[267.90 → 269.52] it's been hilarious
[269.52 → 271.06] for the AMD fanboys,
[271.42 → 271.58] like,
[271.64 → 273.58] how to identify an AMD fanboy,
[274.24 → 274.54] okay,
[274.70 → 275.98] over the last few years.
[276.70 → 277.00] Well,
[277.24 → 279.58] NVIDIA doesn't even have HBM memory.
[280.24 → 280.56] And,
[280.66 → 280.74] like,
[280.90 → 282.62] how much do they know about HBM,
[282.76 → 284.12] and how much do they care about HBM?
[284.44 → 285.00] Who cares?
[285.40 → 285.94] Who cares?
[285.94 → 288.18] It doesn't matter.
[288.58 → 288.96] The price,
[289.04 → 289.52] performance,
[289.80 → 291.56] and power consumption suck.
[291.92 → 292.08] So,
[292.20 → 293.92] the HBM memory is like,
[294.64 → 295.50] okay,
[295.68 → 296.22] good for you.
[296.58 → 296.70] So,
[296.84 → 298.86] HBM memory is nowhere to be found,
[298.96 → 300.48] which is probably how they're managing to do.
[300.60 → 304.50] $649 for what they're saying is a 3080 competitor.
[304.84 → 305.00] So,
[305.06 → 307.58] they're undercutting NVIDIA by about 50 bucks here.
[307.66 → 308.92] It's got 72 Us,
[309.34 → 310.60] 2 gigahertz game clock.
[310.70 → 310.78] Like,
[310.80 → 312.98] this thing is going to be way faster than the 6800.
[313.64 → 314.04] Then,
[314.88 → 315.34] this.
[315.46 → 316.72] I have no idea.
[316.84 → 316.98] Like,
[317.10 → 323.02] had you heard any credible rumour about a 6900 XT?
[323.60 → 323.84] No.
[323.98 → 324.28] Anything.
[324.38 → 324.76] Not at all.
[325.10 → 325.30] I,
[325.30 → 325.56] I,
[325.56 → 327.64] I strongly did not believe,
[328.14 → 329.00] and I was very wrong,
[329.10 → 329.32] clearly.
[329.54 → 332.92] I strongly did not believe they were going to come out being able to compete at the high end at all.
[333.10 → 335.18] And I believe I even said that like a month ago.
[335.26 → 335.42] Oh,
[335.48 → 335.80] probably.
[335.98 → 336.46] On WAN.
[336.46 → 338.72] And there's no way that I would have challenged you on it,
[338.78 → 342.26] but I was not only surprised that we got a legitimate,
[342.56 → 342.74] well,
[343.50 → 344.56] we're going to get,
[344.64 → 345.02] we hope,
[345.26 → 348.90] we're going to be getting legitimate high-end offerings from AMD's Radeon division.
[349.30 → 350.18] Not only that,
[350.32 → 356.26] but they managed to surprise me entirely with a top of the line 6900 XT.
[356.26 → 359.82] This one's got 80 versus 72 compute units for the 6800.
[360.40 → 361.58] Two gigahertz game clock,
[361.72 → 363.44] 16 gigs GDDR6 again.
[364.00 → 368.62] And they are claiming roughly equivalent performance to the RTX 3090,
[368.94 → 372.20] but undercutting it by $500.
[373.46 → 373.98] Now,
[374.24 → 381.30] part of that difference in price is obviously going to be that the RTX 3090 comes with significantly more expensive GDDR6 memory,
[381.30 → 382.92] and a lot more of it.
[383.88 → 384.24] But,
[384.42 → 385.96] I mean,
[386.14 → 386.34] hey,
[386.76 → 388.30] we said this about HBM memory,
[388.42 → 388.76] didn't we?
[388.94 → 390.24] And HBM too after that.
[391.04 → 394.78] Your fancy memory ain't going to do you much good if you don't get the performance.
[395.68 → 395.70] So,
[395.82 → 395.96] yeah.
[396.04 → 396.28] And,
[396.34 → 397.92] and also like the
[397.92 → 398.32] the
[398.32 → 398.68] the
[398.68 → 399.62] the 3090s,
[399.78 → 403.04] as much as NVIDIA's branding around like workstation,
[403.18 → 404.24] non-workstation cards is,
[404.28 → 406.34] is confusing and misleading constantly.
[406.34 → 410.78] But the 3090 is like technically more positioned for non-gamers.
[410.78 → 411.38] Yep.
[411.86 → 412.12] I know.
[412.44 → 414.36] And it feels like the 6900 XT isn't.
[414.44 → 416.40] This feels like it's straight up gamer department.
[416.68 → 417.34] Straight up gamer.
[417.70 → 418.10] And,
[418.22 → 418.98] I mean,
[419.02 → 421.88] as much as NVIDIA might position things as not for gamers,
[422.14 → 423.62] they send very mixed messages.
[423.78 → 423.86] Yeah,
[423.90 → 425.02] they send very mixed messages.
[425.64 → 426.42] You know what's funny though?
[426.44 → 428.80] The only reason that we want any 3090s,
[428.86 → 429.84] like we are actually,
[430.32 → 431.76] I didn't buy it at first.
[431.82 → 432.42] I was like,
[432.70 → 434.22] what do you mean the 3080 is the flagship?
[434.94 → 435.34] Obviously,
[435.34 → 438.12] we're going to do all of our showcase builds with 3090s,
[438.12 → 441.92] but I've actually kind of bought into the whole 3080 is the top of the line
[441.92 → 444.26] and 3090 is like ridiculous now
[444.26 → 448.92] because it just is not enough more performance for how much more expensive it is.
[449.00 → 449.26] Like it's not,
[449.42 → 450.10] like it doesn't exist.
[450.32 → 450.52] Yeah.
[450.64 → 451.96] And it also doesn't exist.
[452.18 → 452.78] Speaking about,
[453.28 → 453.56] sorry,
[453.82 → 454.18] go for it.
[454.40 → 455.00] I was just going to say,
[455.06 → 458.30] the only thing that we're even considering using one for internally
[458.30 → 460.02] is for very,
[460.14 → 462.24] very large video editing projects.
[462.24 → 464.54] All the editing work editors,
[464.74 → 465.96] they want 3090s.
[466.04 → 469.24] And then even the people who told me they were going to buy 3090s,
[469.32 → 470.70] even when they knew it was $1,500.
[472.20 → 473.50] David's one of them at work.
[473.74 → 474.30] He was like,
[474.36 → 475.82] after he saw the performance results,
[475.86 → 476.14] he was like,
[476.20 → 476.30] nah,
[476.32 → 477.12] I'm just going to get 3080.
[478.26 → 478.76] There you go.
[480.10 → 480.66] Hold on.
[480.72 → 481.02] Hold on.
[481.06 → 481.66] Hold that thought.
[482.26 → 485.12] Deadly in Flow plane chat says 3090 is Titan.
[485.80 → 486.16] No,
[486.58 → 487.98] 3090 is not Titan.
[488.68 → 488.88] Yeah.
[489.00 → 492.26] I made it very clear in our review that the 3090 is not Titan.
[492.34 → 493.48] It costs as much as a Titan.
[493.58 → 494.98] So I can see why you're confused,
[495.14 → 500.30] but it's not a Titan because it doesn't have any of the Titan driver
[500.30 → 500.86] optimizations.
[501.08 → 502.64] It's just a really fast gaming card.
[503.94 → 504.42] Boom.
[505.16 → 505.32] All right.
[505.40 → 509.48] So you were talking earlier about how it seemed weird that the 6800 got
[509.48 → 509.92] the
[509.92 → 512.72] got the XT moniker.
[513.24 → 513.54] Yeah.
[513.54 → 514.54] And they're like so different.
[514.74 → 514.94] Yeah.
[515.06 → 517.14] What is interesting to me is how similar,
[517.14 → 519.04] while still being quite different.
[519.16 → 519.26] Sure.
[519.34 → 524.56] But how similar the 6800 XT and the 6900 XT are in terms of spec.
[525.22 → 525.44] Yeah.
[525.64 → 525.84] Yeah.
[526.00 → 526.14] Yeah.
[526.14 → 528.14] There's only everything's the same except for compute.
[528.22 → 529.82] There's only eight more compute units.
[530.34 → 530.82] Yeah.
[530.86 → 531.38] Which is like,
[531.42 → 531.90] that's great.
[532.20 → 536.28] But like almost everything else is different for the 6800 to 6800 XT.
[536.58 → 538.18] They're incredibly different.
[538.34 → 539.80] 12 more compute units,
[540.06 → 541.10] higher game clocks.
[541.10 → 541.72] I mean,
[542.06 → 542.30] okay.
[542.30 → 542.86] Other than that,
[542.92 → 543.94] they're very similar.
[544.10 → 545.34] Higher power consumption though.
[545.54 → 545.74] Yep.
[545.74 → 550.36] So like almost everything is the same except for the memory.
[550.70 → 551.76] Now let's talk features.
[551.98 → 554.54] All the new GPUs support direct X 12 ultimate,
[554.74 → 555.96] including direct storage.
[556.10 → 560.70] So direct storage for the uninitiated is that thing that I put my foot in my
[560.70 → 565.06] mouth over a while back where I was making fun of the PlayStation 5's SSD.
[565.26 → 565.40] Okay.
[565.44 → 565.64] Okay.
[565.64 → 566.74] It's not quite the same thing.
[567.12 → 569.64] Sony's implementation is likely slightly different,
[569.86 → 571.66] but you're treading on dangerous ground there for a second.
[571.66 → 577.24] The underlying hardware is obviously a big Nazi.
[577.50 → 577.80] Okay.
[578.34 → 579.02] So yes,
[579.18 → 581.38] Sony's software implementation isn't direct storage,
[581.50 → 582.82] which is TM Microsoft,
[583.16 → 585.74] but it's basically functionally the same thing.
[585.74 → 586.90] So it allows the
[586.90 → 587.78] um,
[588.58 → 592.26] the GPU to have direct access to the main system storage.
[592.36 → 597.06] So it'll support variable rate shading and ray tracing via what AMD is calling
[597.06 → 598.58] ray accelerators,
[598.70 → 600.18] not to be confused with,
[600.18 → 600.64] um,
[600.82 → 601.64] RT cores.
[602.10 → 602.42] Okay.
[602.68 → 604.46] Those are built into each compute unit.
[604.46 → 609.40] Now AMD also will apparently have a take on DLSS upscaling.
[609.60 → 611.36] They're going to be calling it super resolution,
[611.54 → 614.90] not to be confused with virtual super resolution,
[614.90 → 618.10] which is AMD's up sampling technology.
[618.94 → 619.90] That's a little annoying.
[620.72 → 621.16] Okay.
[621.54 → 621.80] Uh,
[622.72 → 626.12] how hard is it to come up with like a brand for this kind of stuff?
[626.20 → 626.50] You know,
[627.86 → 628.96] apparently very hard.
[629.26 → 630.54] Maybe try to not call it the same thing.
[630.88 → 631.28] Yeah.
[631.28 → 632.94] So what do you,
[632.94 → 633.28] what do you,
[633.38 → 634.06] what's your,
[634.22 → 634.92] what's your feel?
[636.28 → 636.64] Oh,
[636.70 → 638.50] my feel is what's the vibe.
[638.88 → 639.54] I'm so,
[639.72 → 639.90] okay.
[639.96 → 641.16] So I'm going to tell us,
[641.26 → 641.44] um,
[641.44 → 643.22] let's do story time minus story time.
[643.48 → 646.94] I remember when AMD launched Polaris,
[647.40 → 649.58] Polaris was their big,
[649.58 → 651.74] like Radeon is back.
[652.06 → 652.50] Yeah.
[652.50 → 653.50] We're going to stop.
[653.74 → 657.06] We're going to stop re-releasing the same graphics card with a new name over
[657.06 → 658.10] and over and over again.
[658.16 → 659.18] This is going to be awesome.
[659.56 → 660.98] When they launched Polaris,
[660.98 → 662.12] they had a big event,
[662.26 → 664.08] like everyone in their dog was there.
[664.16 → 666.44] They actually sponsored a video for me,
[666.56 → 670.58] which usually is an indication of one of two things.
[670.72 → 675.00] It either indicates things are going really well or that things are going
[675.00 → 676.28] really not as well.
[676.82 → 677.22] Um,
[677.42 → 683.08] and I had actually read it based on the amount of buzz from AMD people as
[683.08 → 684.52] things are going really well.
[684.52 → 687.40] And they just wanted to like to make a big splash.
[687.90 → 688.34] And,
[688.48 → 689.06] um,
[689.06 → 689.26] and,
[689.34 → 691.32] and that was actually the video where Roger Kauri,
[691.32 → 692.16] uh,
[692.16 → 693.24] dropped the card,
[693.34 → 694.64] which was very funny.
[694.70 → 696.36] That pretty much made that video.
[696.48 → 697.10] I loved it.
[697.10 → 698.00] Um,
[698.00 → 698.10] um,
[698.10 → 698.42] anyway,
[699.42 → 704.46] I remember showing up and like the big AMD is back moment,
[704.46 → 705.86] aside from pricing,
[705.92 → 706.86] it was very price competitive.
[706.86 → 708.34] So that was good until pricing,
[708.38 → 713.00] like basically went up with the 500 series and then way up during the mining
[713.00 → 713.38] craze.
[713.38 → 714.74] But that's a whole different thing.
[714.78 → 715.58] We won't talk about that.
[715.90 → 716.30] Um,
[716.34 → 716.84] they're big.
[716.84 → 718.68] Like we're back in the high end.
[718.72 → 721.40] It was like a crossfire slide where they were like,
[721.46 → 721.78] yeah,
[722.26 → 725.74] dual four seventies or dual four eighties or whatever was on.
[725.74 → 729.72] It was like very competitive with NVIDIA's like card.
[729.80 → 731.56] That's actually good on the high end.
[732.20 → 732.64] Um,
[732.96 → 735.52] and like crossfire supported on like lots of motherboards.
[736.08 → 736.58] Uh,
[736.58 → 736.88] and they were,
[736.96 → 739.46] they were trying to brag about crossfire quality at that time.
[739.56 → 739.84] Yeah.
[739.84 → 740.06] Yeah.
[740.06 → 740.24] Yeah.
[740.24 → 740.50] Yeah.
[740.50 → 740.64] Yeah.
[740.64 → 741.56] How'd that work out for them?
[741.62 → 741.90] Bad.
[741.90 → 742.30] So,
[742.30 → 743.22] so,
[743.42 → 746.66] so my problem is that AMD has disappointed me.
[746.84 → 749.52] And hyped me up so many times.
[749.66 → 750.60] And even like,
[750.68 → 751.98] that wasn't that long ago.
[752.28 → 754.72] Like there's people that are still Roger's not there,
[754.72 → 759.64] but there's people still at AMD who worked with me on that event.
[759.82 → 760.84] And I was like,
[761.32 → 761.62] and like,
[761.68 → 762.08] to be clear,
[762.14 → 763.18] just something to add in here.
[763.18 → 765.58] Because I know there's going to be people like me,
[765.58 → 766.22] um,
[766.32 → 769.82] that enjoyed pointing out that it's not just AMD that does that.
[769.82 → 770.92] It's happened with NVIDIA.
[771.06 → 772.22] It's happened with Intel.
[772.40 → 774.06] It's happened with basically everybody.
[774.26 → 776.82] It's happened a lot with AMD.
[776.84 → 777.08] AMD.
[777.26 → 779.42] And it's happened over the years.
[779.42 → 781.20] It wasn't like centralized at one point.
[781.40 → 781.72] Yes.
[781.96 → 785.62] AMD has been disappointing me for as long as I've been making tech videos.
[785.90 → 787.08] So it's like,
[787.08 → 787.84] eh,
[788.46 → 789.52] well before actually,
[789.52 → 789.96] if we go,
[790.04 → 791.10] if we go really far back.
[791.66 → 791.76] Yeah.
[792.02 → 792.82] So that's my,
[793.00 → 793.94] that's my problem.
[794.18 → 794.58] You know,
[795.14 → 797.26] that's why I have a really hard time with this,
[797.34 → 799.02] but fine.
[799.16 → 799.30] Go,
[799.56 → 799.78] go.
[799.90 → 800.94] These look kind of awesome.
[801.08 → 802.28] They do look kind of awesome,
[802.28 → 803.58] but they always do this.
[803.96 → 804.24] Okay.
[804.40 → 806.20] So here's where it could go wrong.
[806.58 → 807.62] Here's where it could go wrong.
[807.92 → 809.96] The drivers could be buggy and flaky.
[809.96 → 812.64] Like we experienced with the 5700 series.
[812.78 → 815.06] Speaking of disappointments that weren't very long ago.
[815.84 → 817.52] They have gotten better since then,
[817.68 → 818.54] but at launch,
[818.88 → 820.64] they just shouldn't have launched at that time.
[820.80 → 821.58] Like at launch,
[821.66 → 822.98] they were not good.
[823.62 → 824.92] So the drivers could be bad.
[825.60 → 827.10] Continued driver support is,
[827.10 → 829.36] is often a little bit more rough on that side.
[829.40 → 832.88] And they seem to prioritize like weird features that I don't think anyone
[832.88 → 833.76] really cares about.
[833.86 → 835.28] And then kind of,
[835.28 → 835.68] um,
[835.98 → 836.16] yeah,
[836.16 → 837.38] like half asset.
[837.38 → 841.38] And then they're not competitive on stuff that matters like video encoding.
[842.16 → 842.64] Um,
[842.64 → 844.10] so disappointments,
[844.38 → 846.12] another disappointment could be features.
[846.34 → 850.48] So they've like got an answer to everything from NVIDIA,
[850.62 → 853.58] but they've had an answer to a lot of NVIDIA's tech,
[853.70 → 854.12] uh,
[854.12 → 854.50] like,
[854.50 → 854.88] uh,
[854.88 → 855.60] like shadow play,
[855.60 → 856.16] for example,
[856.16 → 857.00] for a long time,
[857.00 → 860.38] but it's so who cares?
[860.94 → 861.22] Um,
[861.22 → 862.74] so that's another way that it could disappoint.
[863.26 → 863.50] Um,
[863.50 → 866.16] another way it could disappoint is so far,
[866.16 → 869.72] everything that I've seen in the slides is like,
[869.72 → 870.06] uh,
[870.06 → 870.30] you know,
[870.34 → 871.26] average FPS.
[871.86 → 872.88] As far as I know,
[872.92 → 873.28] that's,
[873.44 → 873.46] uh,
[873.46 → 873.60] here,
[873.66 → 873.86] hold on.
[873.88 → 874.70] Let me pull up these images.
[874.84 → 875.04] Yeah.
[875.54 → 877.84] All they're showing is frames per second,
[877.84 → 880.68] which I would have to assume is average frames per second.
[881.08 → 881.48] Um,
[881.54 → 886.46] it could be terrible when it comes to like 99th percentile minimums and it
[886.46 → 887.46] could be really stutter.
[887.46 → 887.68] Yeah.
[887.74 → 888.92] So it could be a stutter mess,
[889.06 → 889.60] um,
[889.60 → 889.78] you know,
[889.78 → 893.76] not actually effectively running at that level of smoothness.
[894.58 → 894.98] Um,
[895.34 → 895.72] but,
[896.16 → 896.72] also,
[897.04 → 897.48] you know,
[898.08 → 904.74] AMD's recent swagger on the CPU side of things has been mostly based on
[904.74 → 908.76] measuring things the way that the tech press likes to measure it,
[908.78 → 911.06] not just kind of like making up their own metrics for things and saying,
[911.42 → 911.74] yay,
[911.84 → 912.62] we're competitive.
[913.28 → 913.80] Ha ha.
[914.32 → 915.04] Go AMD.
[915.84 → 916.28] Starks.
[916.78 → 917.06] You know,
[917.10 → 917.76] like it's been,
[917.76 → 920.20] it's been better than that for the most part.
[923.40 → 923.84] Yeah.
[923.84 → 925.76] I'm going to let AMD into my heart one more time.
[928.46 → 928.94] I think,
[928.94 → 930.18] I think you'd do it more than once.
[930.38 → 932.06] I think if they disappointed you this time,
[932.10 → 932.96] I think you'd do it again,
[933.06 → 933.94] but I,
[933.94 → 935.66] I am feeling pretty good about this.
[935.78 → 935.94] They,
[935.94 → 937.94] they have been on an uptrend overall,
[937.94 → 939.44] um,
[939.44 → 940.42] for quite a while now.
[940.42 → 942.66] And we've been kind of waiting for GPU to catch up.
[943.56 → 943.96] Yes.
[943.96 → 945.18] So hopefully this is it.
[945.30 → 946.46] I think if you,
[946.54 → 948.04] if you just buy off the hop,
[948.10 → 948.46] I,
[948.46 → 950.06] I think no matter what the scenario,
[950.22 → 952.22] I think no matter what the brand you're taking a risk,
[952.70 → 953.16] um,
[953.38 → 956.02] I would still definitely wait for reviews.
[956.20 → 957.22] I would also,
[957.90 → 958.26] uh,
[958.66 → 959.96] I would also wait.
[960.28 → 960.62] Um,
[960.62 → 962.12] we saw this with 3000 series.
[962.12 → 962.40] I would,
[962.44 → 963.24] I would also wait for,
[963.34 → 964.82] for user reviews as well.
[964.98 → 965.26] Oh yeah.
[965.32 → 965.86] A hundred percent.
[965.86 → 968.36] Because even the professional reviewers,
[968.96 → 970.62] that's a sample size of,
[970.62 → 971.12] you know,
[971.36 → 971.88] dozens.
[972.46 → 972.52] Right.
[972.52 → 973.04] And there's,
[973.14 → 976.44] there's some brute force style testing that you can't really do.
[976.62 → 976.86] Yes.
[977.00 → 977.44] Um,
[977.48 → 978.68] like compatibility testing,
[978.80 → 980.36] compatibility testing,
[980.36 → 981.08] uh,
[981.12 → 983.56] like weird settings in specific games,
[983.56 → 984.64] um,
[984.90 → 986.08] weird resolution combinations,
[986.08 → 987.28] like a few things like that,
[987.28 → 988.76] that just probably aren't going to get tested.
[988.90 → 989.04] Yep.
[989.04 → 992.02] That's part of the reason why we've always suggested looking at a variety of
[992.02 → 992.46] reviewers.
[993.02 → 993.46] Absolutely.
[994.06 → 994.38] And,
[994.48 → 995.48] and that,
[995.58 → 997.02] that also ties into user review.
[997.10 → 999.22] So I would be cautious,
[999.64 → 1001.18] but excited.
[1001.40 → 1001.54] Yeah.
[1001.56 → 1002.30] This looks awesome.
[1002.30 → 1002.90] I'm stoked.
[1003.12 → 1004.60] I'm really happy to have them back up.
[1004.96 → 1005.18] Uh,
[1005.18 → 1006.10] there's been all these memes,
[1006.20 → 1007.44] like there's a meme of,
[1007.56 → 1007.84] uh,
[1008.28 → 1008.68] uh,
[1008.78 → 1014.32] Lisa Sue dressed up as the Reaper and like Intel's door is already like
[1014.32 → 1015.22] knocked down.
[1015.74 → 1016.22] Uh,
[1016.22 → 1018.40] and then they're like knocking on Nvidia's door.
[1018.64 → 1019.38] It's cool.
[1019.54 → 1020.18] I like it.
[1020.42 → 1020.94] I like the
[1020.98 → 1021.50] I like the
[1021.54 → 1021.82] the
[1021.86 → 1024.06] the energy I'm happy competition is coming.
[1024.60 → 1026.12] Intel had their day.
[1026.66 → 1027.06] Um,
[1027.46 → 1029.68] now it's time for Nvidia to hopefully get wrecked.
[1029.68 → 1030.20] Uh,
[1030.20 → 1031.40] that would be very,
[1031.40 → 1034.18] very healthy and good for the PC environment.
[1034.18 → 1035.22] So I hope they do it.
[1035.22 → 1038.14] I'm also excited to see just like full out team red computers.
[1038.26 → 1039.12] I think that's really cool.
[1039.12 → 1045.82] And something we haven't seen in a way that I would say is legitimately in quite a long time.
[1045.82 → 1050.04] have you seen this?
[1050.04 → 1060.74] I have not seen this,
[1060.74 → 1062.18] but that's amazing.
[1062.38 → 1065.08] Only 426 people have seen this so far,
[1065.20 → 1065.88] but we can,
[1065.96 → 1066.26] uh,
[1066.56 → 1066.86] I can,
[1066.86 → 1068.10] I can post this in the chat.
[1068.10 → 1069.88] If you guys want to go enjoy it for yourselves,
[1069.88 → 1070.86] this is fantastic.
[1070.86 → 1073.80] Basically this,
[1073.92 → 1075.12] this already existed,
[1075.12 → 1075.62] but,
[1075.74 → 1076.12] uh,
[1077.30 → 1077.68] yeah,
[1077.72 → 1077.96] anyway,
[1078.02 → 1078.36] you know what?
[1078.38 → 1078.82] It doesn't,
[1078.84 → 1079.42] it doesn't matter.
[1079.52 → 1079.80] Let's just,
[1079.86 → 1080.22] we can put,
[1080.30 → 1081.22] we can put that away for now.
[1081.24 → 1081.78] It's pretty funny.
[1082.14 → 1082.42] Uh,
[1082.42 → 1082.56] yeah,
[1082.58 → 1082.88] lots,
[1083.02 → 1083.46] lots of,
[1083.54 → 1085.04] lots of AMD memes these days.
[1085.66 → 1087.92] One of the slaps that they did was out of stock.
[1088.04 → 1090.80] We are definitely yet to see how many of these cards are going to be available.
[1091.06 → 1092.20] Let's wait and see.
[1092.20 → 1093.24] Um,
[1093.24 → 1096.86] cause with all the excitement around gaming in general right now,
[1096.92 → 1097.10] guys,
[1097.16 → 1097.26] like,
[1097.32 → 1099.62] remember it's like not just TikToker,
[1099.78 → 1104.34] it's like new console launch TikToker and new console launch means lots of exciting games coming.
[1104.46 → 1104.70] Cyberpunk,
[1104.96 → 1110.80] how many tens of thousands of people are going to be upgrading their gaming PCs for cyberpunk 2077?
[1111.46 → 1111.50] Like,
[1111.56 → 1111.64] yeah.
[1111.70 → 1112.04] And it's,
[1112.14 → 1112.46] and it's,
[1112.46 → 1114.16] and it's COVID TikToker too.
[1114.44 → 1115.04] Oh yeah.
[1115.42 → 1119.52] People are knowing they're going to be stuck inside over the winter way more than they normally are.
[1119.56 → 1121.02] All that pent-up demand.
[1121.02 → 1122.56] And they're ready to,
[1122.70 → 1123.60] they're ready to do stuff.
[1123.72 → 1129.06] One thing I don't have any demand for is AMD graphics cards in my workstations.
[1130.86 → 1132.38] Am I wrong to think that?
[1133.32 → 1133.84] OpenCL?
[1134.02 → 1135.88] I don't think so.
[1136.02 → 1136.14] Well,
[1136.18 → 1137.48] cause generally,
[1138.06 → 1138.52] um,
[1138.78 → 1139.04] okay.
[1139.12 → 1139.66] For one,
[1139.84 → 1140.16] yeah,
[1140.30 → 1141.28] it's probably just going to be worse,
[1141.38 → 1142.74] but also generally you've,
[1142.78 → 1144.32] you've usually stayed a gen back,
[1144.38 → 1144.76] haven't you?
[1144.86 → 1145.70] For stability reasons?
[1145.86 → 1146.18] Um,
[1146.30 → 1146.84] you know what?
[1146.84 → 1148.28] I know you're talking about 30 nineties right now,
[1148.28 → 1148.64] but like,
[1148.70 → 1149.32] isn't that a thing?
[1149.66 → 1151.00] Usually we've stayed a gen back.
[1151.00 → 1153.36] on CPU and GPU.
[1153.74 → 1154.14] Um,
[1154.14 → 1155.90] we are talking about going 30 90.
[1155.90 → 1160.28] And the reason for it is just that there's nothing current gen that makes any sense.
[1160.46 → 1161.40] So we can get,
[1161.40 → 1163.98] we could get to current gen squadron,
[1164.10 → 1164.34] uh,
[1164.34 → 1165.30] because we need more memory.
[1165.42 → 1166.12] That's the problem.
[1166.12 → 1166.62] Um,
[1166.62 → 1168.18] so we can't go 2080 Ti.
[1168.34 → 1169.44] It's only got 11 gigs of memory.
[1169.54 → 1170.94] It's not enough because,
[1171.16 → 1171.58] and honestly,
[1171.58 → 1172.18] it's a bug,
[1172.18 → 1172.94] um,
[1172.94 → 1176.66] with our 12k black magic footage that we're trying to figure out if we can even freaking
[1176.66 → 1177.04] use.
[1177.24 → 1180.90] So RTX 30 90 plus our thread ripper workstations,
[1180.90 → 1182.38] it seems to handle it,
[1182.38 → 1184.54] but I do,
[1184.66 → 1185.34] I do like,
[1185.46 → 1185.98] like you said,
[1186.04 → 1187.70] I do worry about going current gen anything.
[1187.70 → 1188.66] So that's part of it.
[1188.74 → 1193.74] And then the other part of it is just Nvidia support in the applications that we use is just
[1193.74 → 1198.32] not even close to the same realm that AMD occupies.
[1198.32 → 1200.24] So it would be really,
[1200.24 → 1204.56] really tough for us to go AMD for our actual workstations.
[1204.56 → 1205.50] Even if I,
[1205.68 → 1208.66] even if I would consider it for my personal rig, and you know what,
[1208.68 → 1209.80] I'm going to be honest with you.
[1209.92 → 1211.98] Maybe part of this is just habit,
[1212.18 → 1213.68] but man,
[1213.72 → 1219.90] it would take more than just being price competitive for me to consider walking away from Nvidia for my
[1219.90 → 1220.48] personal rig,
[1220.90 → 1222.62] because you got to consider like,
[1222.94 → 1223.56] how does,
[1223.80 → 1224.78] how does,
[1224.88 → 1225.34] uh,
[1225.36 → 1225.60] you know,
[1225.66 → 1226.94] customer trust work,
[1227.04 → 1227.38] right?
[1227.38 → 1234.66] Like I remember a time when graphics card driver crashes were a normal thing.
[1235.24 → 1240.32] I don't remember the last time I had one and your experience might've been different.
[1240.80 → 1241.06] You know,
[1241.16 → 1244.48] maybe your power supply is not as good,
[1244.48 → 1249.90] or maybe there's some weird edge case compatibility issue with that game you love to play or whatever the
[1249.90 → 1250.38] case may be.
[1250.46 → 1252.60] But my experience has been fantastic.
[1253.00 → 1253.96] And for me,
[1254.02 → 1256.20] it's really hard at my,
[1256.32 → 1256.72] you know,
[1256.72 → 1259.74] stage in life where I don't have as much time to tinker with things.
[1259.74 → 1263.52] Like I don't even overclock my personal rig because I just can't be arsed.
[1263.70 → 1266.22] I don't need a little bit more performance per dollar.
[1266.32 → 1269.04] I need something that just works so that if I sit down, and I'm like,
[1269.08 → 1269.78] I'm going to play a game.
[1270.28 → 1276.80] I play a game instead of playing tune the graphics card or reinstall the driver or whatever the case may be.
[1276.80 → 1277.80] So it would be,
[1277.80 → 1278.82] it would be really,
[1278.82 → 1279.42] really,
[1279.42 → 1280.90] really hard.
[1281.14 → 1286.12] Especially with a lot of people doing work from home and their personal computers are,
[1286.36 → 1290.24] it's not just for gaming or doing whatever else they want to do on it personally,
[1290.24 → 1294.78] but it's also for work stuff that has to have 100% uptime.
[1294.78 → 1297.50] It has to be like fantastic.
[1297.76 → 1298.70] AMD says they're,
[1298.76 → 1300.28] they're making a commitment to,
[1300.28 → 1300.92] you know,
[1301.30 → 1302.18] driver it up.
[1302.64 → 1302.92] And,
[1303.04 → 1303.12] you know,
[1303.14 → 1303.70] that's great.
[1304.00 → 1304.38] But,
[1304.48 → 1305.04] you know,
[1305.06 → 1305.36] it's,
[1305.44 → 1308.28] if you can't keep it consistent from one board partner to another,
[1308.60 → 1308.74] well,
[1308.82 → 1309.46] actually,
[1309.60 → 1309.76] yeah,
[1309.76 → 1312.06] you end up with an NVIDIA RTX 3080,
[1312.16 → 1312.52] don't you?
[1312.88 → 1316.08] We've got a chat from Fern 182 in the flow plane chat here.
[1316.08 → 1320.30] My experience with the 5700 XT reference gigabyte has been very good so far,
[1320.38 → 1322.38] but I know there's a lot of people that had tons of driver issues.
[1322.58 → 1322.84] Totally.
[1324.18 → 1324.50] Meanwhile,
[1324.62 → 1325.60] AJ is like,
[1325.66 → 1325.84] yep,
[1326.18 → 1326.32] yeah,
[1326.38 → 1327.72] mine's been great on my HTPC,
[1327.94 → 1329.06] but like AJ,
[1329.18 → 1330.84] you went, and you put it in like a secondary machine.
[1331.40 → 1332.26] Would you put it in your,
[1332.36 → 1333.10] in your daily driver,
[1333.24 → 1333.80] in your main rig?
[1334.60 → 1334.88] Hmm.
[1335.22 → 1335.48] Yeah.
[1335.78 → 1335.98] Hmm.
[1336.24 → 1336.56] Interesting.
[1337.36 → 1341.42] There's a couple more interesting features that we should talk about that make Radeon 6000 series unique.
[1341.42 → 1344.38] There's 128 legs of infinity cache.
[1344.84 → 1345.46] That's on die.
[1345.46 → 1350.22] That's over twice as fast as the GDDR6 and is apparently to help reduce memory bandwidth bottlenecks.
[1350.68 → 1352.12] And there's a set bonus.
[1352.54 → 1354.50] So this is interesting.
[1355.04 → 1360.78] Smart access memory provides the CPU with full access to all the GPU's memory.
[1361.22 → 1362.02] That is,
[1362.12 → 1364.40] as long as you're running Ry zen 5000 series.
[1364.60 → 1368.62] And apparently you're looking at a 6 to 10% speed up in games that benefit.
[1368.62 → 1368.90] Now,
[1370.34 → 1375.22] Rumblings Online suggests that this is an implementation of the resizable bar feature
[1375.22 → 1376.34] that Microsoft is pushing,
[1376.48 → 1379.80] meaning that future NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs may support it,
[1379.80 → 1382.34] but it's only AMD for now.
[1383.04 → 1388.22] And what's really cool is that games don't necessarily need explicit support for it.
[1388.56 → 1395.16] That could be a very exciting advantage for AMD in order to entice people to buy an all red machine.
[1396.30 → 1397.06] It's cool.
[1397.18 → 1397.98] It's a cool feature.
[1397.98 → 1402.08] I was going to say,
[1402.26 → 1402.34] like,
[1402.48 → 1404.64] there's another thing that's going to get people to buy AMD,
[1405.00 → 1408.68] which is anything but Intel NVIDIA fans.
[1409.60 → 1411.68] People that just want to anyway.
[1411.90 → 1413.32] But there's the same thing on the other side.
[1413.36 → 1413.92] Like you were saying,
[1413.98 → 1414.88] you're used to NVIDIA,
[1414.98 → 1416.08] so you might want to stick there anyway.
[1416.74 → 1417.44] But yeah,
[1417.56 → 1422.06] you said earlier that AMD has had an answer for all of NVIDIA's features.
[1422.06 → 1423.54] I don't think that's quite true.
[1424.02 → 1426.36] But they also have unique stuff like this.
[1427.62 → 1428.68] So that's cool.
[1428.82 → 1429.34] Not very much.
[1429.48 → 1430.68] I think this is pretty much it.
[1430.86 → 1431.64] That's a pretty big deal,
[1431.70 → 1431.88] though.
[1432.34 → 1432.94] It is.
[1433.02 → 1434.02] It is super cool.
[1434.26 → 1437.02] Six to 10% extra performance is better than a kick in the teeth.
[1437.08 → 1438.02] That's what I always say.
[1440.60 → 1441.96] That's a standard quote of mine.
[1442.14 → 1443.58] And they've got Rage Mode,
[1444.24 → 1448.44] which is an automatic overclocking function that essentially just sets a higher power target.
[1448.44 → 1452.56] So it's not really overclocking and AMD claims only a 1% to 2% speed up.
[1453.18 → 1457.60] So pretty much it's just what you could do in like two seconds in Afterburner on an NVIDIA card.
[1458.16 → 1462.64] Someone needs to make a custom PC that's like fire themed.
[1463.44 → 1468.22] And when Rage Mode activates, it like lights the flames up or something.
[1468.44 → 1472.50] We actually have an engineer on staff at Creator Warehouse now
[1472.50 → 1475.26] that probably would have the capability to do something like that.
[1475.74 → 1476.40] That would be sick.
[1476.58 → 1477.86] That would be amazing.
[1477.86 → 1478.60] You guys should do it.
[1478.78 → 1479.30] That'd be cool.
[1479.56 → 1482.90] I don't want to be responsible for someone's house burning down.
[1483.18 → 1484.10] Okay, let me get through this.
[1484.16 → 1486.52] And then I will tell you something that this person's working on
[1486.52 → 1489.52] that is actually started out really stupid
[1489.52 → 1491.94] and is turning into something that maybe is cool.
[1492.40 → 1495.38] So it's worth pointing out that NVIDIA's RTX 3070 launch
[1495.38 → 1498.02] was stretched out from the 27th to the 29th
[1498.02 → 1500.42] in what appeared to be an attempt to bury the Radeon announcement.
[1500.90 → 1503.88] However, the AMD hype seems to have prevailed.
[1504.14 → 1506.30] We don't know how NVIDIA is going to respond.
[1506.30 → 1507.40] But then again, I did.
[1507.48 → 1507.68] Hold on.
[1507.70 → 1509.70] Let me just make sure this isn't embargoed.
[1510.74 → 1511.02] Burke.
[1512.10 → 1512.96] Not that Burke.
[1513.06 → 1513.64] Different Burke.
[1514.40 → 1514.74] Yes.
[1515.34 → 1516.06] Blah, blah, blah.
[1516.34 → 1516.64] Sorry.
[1516.72 → 1517.92] I had an email glitch.
[1517.96 → 1520.04] If you want to check out any of this for your test bed.
[1520.12 → 1520.24] Nope.
[1520.28 → 1520.96] Not that one.
[1522.12 → 1523.26] Embargoed information.
[1523.26 → 1525.86] 1030 embargo lift is...
[1525.86 → 1526.22] Oh, wait.
[1526.34 → 1527.94] 1030:6 a.m. Pacific time.
[1528.02 → 1528.34] Yeah, okay.
[1529.10 → 1529.58] Let me do that.
[1529.94 → 1530.68] Yeah, okay.
[1531.00 → 1533.74] So NVIDIA has a Black Ops...
[1533.74 → 1535.76] Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War bundle
[1535.76 → 1539.10] with RTX 3080 and 3090 that's running now.
[1539.16 → 1541.34] So that's one of the responses is giving away games.
[1541.80 → 1543.62] You can always tell competitions heating up
[1543.62 → 1545.82] when free games start coming with graphics cards again.
[1546.00 → 1548.26] Remember when graphics cards came with like...
[1548.26 → 1550.12] Four or five free games.
[1550.12 → 1550.56] Or not even.
[1550.76 → 1551.50] And like good ones.
[1551.76 → 1553.76] Like you'd get like Prince of Persia
[1553.76 → 1555.60] and like some Assassin's Creed game
[1555.60 → 1557.62] and then like a couple little ones you hadn't heard of.
[1557.68 → 1558.28] And like, yeah, cool.
[1558.34 → 1560.78] I've got like games to play for the next couple of months.
[1561.18 → 1564.10] It also used to be like a relatively major form of...
[1564.10 → 1565.68] This was probably against terms of service,
[1565.80 → 1568.48] but it used to be a relatively major form of rebate
[1568.48 → 1569.92] is people would try to flip the games.
[1570.10 → 1571.06] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[1571.12 → 1571.74] And it was a thing.
[1571.92 → 1572.76] People would try to flip the games.
[1573.04 → 1573.76] People, Luke?
[1574.50 → 1574.90] People.
[1575.50 → 1577.46] Would you know the names of these people?
[1577.60 → 1577.86] None of them.
[1578.26 → 1581.22] I don't know what you're talking about.
[1582.64 → 1583.04] Okay.
[1583.14 → 1584.34] I have a worse confession.
[1585.38 → 1585.78] Okay.
[1586.06 → 1586.28] Okay.
[1586.28 → 1587.34] When I was a sales rep,
[1587.58 → 1588.80] from time to time,
[1588.96 → 1591.66] I would have people come in and buy a system with SLI.
[1592.02 → 1592.58] And I'd be like,
[1593.08 → 1593.28] hey,
[1593.50 → 1595.76] you just got two copies of that game.
[1596.34 → 1597.08] You need both of them?
[1598.98 → 1600.04] More often than not,
[1600.08 → 1600.66] they'd be like,
[1600.72 → 1601.66] you know what?
[1601.68 → 1602.52] You've been very helpful.
[1602.64 → 1603.12] Here you go.
[1603.84 → 1604.84] Oh, my God.
[1604.92 → 1607.56] I definitely got some games that way.
[1607.56 → 1608.76] Did you flip them?
[1610.04 → 1611.78] No, I tried to be a good boy.
[1612.26 → 1614.26] So, no, I did not actually flip games.
[1614.38 → 1615.76] I did give them away to people,
[1615.98 → 1616.98] but I did not flip them.
[1617.50 → 1617.74] Okay.
[1618.02 → 1618.24] Okay.
[1619.56 → 1619.92] Okay.
[1619.96 → 1620.52] What were you going to say?
[1620.60 → 1620.78] Sorry.
[1620.78 → 1625.32] I don't think I remember at this point.
[1625.38 → 1625.58] Sweet.
[1625.68 → 1625.90] Okay.
[1626.04 → 1627.66] I'm going to talk about our project then.
[1628.16 → 1629.22] I have a problem.
[1629.72 → 1631.00] My feet sweat a lot.
[1631.54 → 1631.82] Like,
[1631.86 → 1632.78] that's why I wear sandals.
[1632.80 → 1633.02] Okay.
[1633.12 → 1635.30] Because I have warm boy feet.
[1635.66 → 1637.42] And when I play badminton in particular,
[1637.94 → 1642.52] they sweat so much that the outside of my shoes,
[1642.68 → 1644.38] which are like this thick at the top,
[1644.38 → 1647.56] the outside is like wet to the touch,
[1647.64 → 1648.14] not damp,
[1648.62 → 1649.74] wet to the touch.
[1650.00 → 1650.24] So,
[1650.32 → 1654.52] my problem is that if I play even two days apart,
[1654.84 → 1657.22] my shoes will still be damp,
[1657.42 → 1659.94] even with those little absorbent like ball things
[1659.94 → 1660.86] that you can put in them.
[1661.42 → 1663.86] And when you play badminton in damp shoes
[1663.86 → 1666.08] or run in damp shoes or whatever else,
[1666.38 → 1670.32] your skin gets all soggy and makes it so that you can get blisters more easily
[1670.32 → 1674.72] or you can like to rip off chunks of skin if you're particularly rambunctious.
[1675.40 → 1675.84] So,
[1676.04 → 1680.44] I had a problem and I went to our new engineer who works for Creator Warehouse
[1680.44 → 1681.64] and I was like,
[1681.92 → 1683.60] I want you to make me a shoe dryer.
[1685.46 → 1685.86] So,
[1686.18 → 1686.86] the concept...
[1686.86 → 1688.04] Okay.
[1688.12 → 1688.56] Hold on a second.
[1689.12 → 1689.40] Now,
[1689.84 → 1692.94] such a thing does exist for like ski boots.
[1692.98 → 1693.16] Okay,
[1693.22 → 1693.48] stop.
[1693.84 → 1696.18] Such a thing does exist for like ski boots,
[1696.42 → 1701.38] like a plug-in shoe dryer that sits in like your entryway at your ski lodge or whatever.
[1701.68 → 1701.94] So,
[1702.00 → 1703.60] you can put your boots on, and it dries it out.
[1703.80 → 1704.26] But,
[1704.60 → 1710.54] but I don't actually need anything that hardcore because it's not like a giant plastic boot.
[1710.64 → 1712.16] It's just like normal running shoes.
[1712.48 → 1712.92] So,
[1713.08 → 1716.14] I just need any kind of airflow is what I thought.
[1716.36 → 1716.80] So,
[1716.90 → 1718.52] he did a proof of concept for me,
[1718.56 → 1720.66] where he just put a little Noctua fan,
[1721.06 → 1722.66] just like sitting in a shoe.
[1722.86 → 1726.96] Not only did it dry out the shoe like many times faster,
[1727.16 → 1730.90] it actually dried out the entire gym bag way faster,
[1731.38 → 1732.96] which I thought was pretty cool.
[1733.08 → 1733.16] So,
[1733.16 → 1733.46] I was like,
[1733.52 → 1733.68] okay,
[1733.94 → 1734.56] here's my,
[1734.66 → 1737.86] here's my sort of key performance indicators for this product.
[1737.86 → 1743.14] It needs to have good enough battery that I can work out three times a week and only charge it once a month.
[1743.14 → 1747.76] It needs to be small enough to fit in my shoes.
[1748.04 → 1753.76] It needs to be affordable enough that I can like reasonably be expected to buy two of them.
[1754.08 → 1754.60] One for,
[1754.70 → 1755.78] one for each of my shoes.
[1756.36 → 1756.72] And,
[1756.72 → 1758.82] and it needs to like,
[1758.90 → 1759.24] I don't know,
[1759.28 → 1759.78] kind of look cool.
[1760.36 → 1760.62] So,
[1761.32 → 1762.28] I saw,
[1762.36 → 1763.44] You're going to try to sell this.
[1763.54 → 1763.82] I saw,
[1764.18 → 1764.46] okay,
[1764.52 → 1764.94] just hold on.
[1765.04 → 1765.24] Oh,
[1765.32 → 1765.54] no,
[1765.62 → 1765.78] oh,
[1765.78 → 1765.88] no.
[1765.88 → 1767.96] I intended this as a product from the
[1767.96 → 1768.96] from the get-go.
[1768.96 → 1769.60] So,
[1769.60 → 1775.64] so I saw a prototype today that is frankly amazing.
[1776.70 → 1777.70] And get this,
[1778.32 → 1780.70] it might end up being not totally stupid.
[1780.80 → 1780.88] So,
[1780.94 → 1781.40] what it is,
[1781.62 → 1785.66] is its two like Tesla sized lithium-ion cells.
[1785.98 → 1786.26] So,
[1786.30 → 1787.36] it's like pretty big,
[1787.46 → 1787.94] pretty long.
[1788.14 → 1788.28] You know,
[1788.32 → 1788.66] it's thick.
[1788.72 → 1789.24] It's a thick boy.
[1789.30 → 1789.80] It's kind of heavy,
[1789.92 → 1792.84] but that's what it takes to get a month of battery life out of something.
[1793.54 → 1793.94] So,
[1793.94 → 1795.46] two big Tesla sized cells.
[1795.70 → 1798.90] It's got a little PCB that he designed and had printed for like a dollar.
[1799.06 → 1799.26] Somehow.
[1799.38 → 1800.46] I don't know how I managed to do that,
[1800.54 → 1800.92] but yeah,
[1801.04 → 1801.18] some,
[1801.32 → 1803.92] he knows a guy or something who does super cheap,
[1803.98 → 1805.44] like prototype grade PCBs.
[1805.62 → 1807.96] And then it's got a little knock to a fan at the end,
[1807.96 → 1809.78] little like five volt knocks to a fan.
[1810.42 → 1812.40] And I was looking at it today, and I was like,
[1812.70 → 1815.32] this is like 10,000 William hour battery bank at this point.
[1816.06 → 1818.20] Why don't we just make it also a battery bank?
[1818.64 → 1820.10] And then Nick's standing there.
[1820.18 → 1820.70] Just hold on,
[1820.74 → 1821.02] hold on,
[1821.06 → 1821.34] hold on.
[1821.46 → 1822.30] Oh my God.
[1822.46 → 1823.80] Nick's standing there, and he's like,
[1824.26 → 1824.48] yeah.
[1824.88 → 1826.24] And if we need the
[1826.32 → 1828.54] if we need the fan to like blow air,
[1828.54 → 1830.62] like around in it and circulate air,
[1830.76 → 1834.62] then we might as well just like to make the fan a little bit more powerful.
[1835.34 → 1837.54] And it could also be just like a fan.
[1838.06 → 1839.70] So you can have a battery bank.
[1839.92 → 1840.40] Hold on.
[1840.66 → 1840.94] Shut up.
[1841.04 → 1841.32] Shut up.
[1841.52 → 1845.38] You can have a battery bank that is also a fan.
[1845.38 → 1846.34] So if it's like a hot day,
[1846.38 → 1847.14] you just like hold it.
[1847.30 → 1850.96] So you got your USB plugged into the end as you're charging your phone in your pocket or whatever.
[1851.34 → 1852.08] You're like blowing,
[1852.26 → 1853.76] blowing a fan on your face or,
[1853.90 → 1854.08] or,
[1854.20 → 1854.38] or,
[1854.38 → 1856.34] or gaming from a gaming standpoint.
[1856.68 → 1856.86] Okay.
[1856.92 → 1858.92] You put it up at the edge of your mouse pad,
[1859.54 → 1860.86] blow it over your gaming hand.
[1861.06 → 1861.40] Okay.
[1861.40 → 1863.82] And if you're like,
[1863.88 → 1864.24] you know,
[1864.84 → 1865.20] going,
[1865.44 → 1865.82] going,
[1866.02 → 1868.20] going ham on a jog on the weekend or whatever,
[1868.28 → 1868.52] and you know,
[1868.52 → 1869.28] you're going to go out,
[1869.36 → 1869.64] you know,
[1870.04 → 1871.68] the next day you want to go for a jog game,
[1871.72 → 1872.44] you pop it in your shoe,
[1872.54 → 1872.76] boom,
[1873.20 → 1873.96] eight hours later,
[1874.00 → 1874.54] your shoes dry,
[1875.00 → 1875.52] ready to go.
[1875.88 → 1880.60] The bit that you hold to have the fan below nice air on,
[1880.66 → 1881.80] you can heat up as well.
[1881.80 → 1883.82] So that it's an all season sports device.
[1884.00 → 1884.02] Well,
[1884.06 → 1886.28] it might just heat up anyway with those cells in there.
[1886.54 → 1886.64] No,
[1886.72 → 1887.96] actually probably not.
[1888.20 → 1888.98] so anyway,
[1889.20 → 1889.74] what we could,
[1889.92 → 1890.18] what we,
[1890.60 → 1891.26] Polo says,
[1891.38 → 1892.52] no one will buy this.
[1893.00 → 1893.80] Don't worry about it.
[1894.04 → 1894.82] Don't worry about it.
[1895.00 → 1895.38] So,
[1895.76 → 1896.12] uh,
[1896.12 → 1896.72] what was I going to say?
[1896.76 → 1896.92] Right.
[1897.46 → 1901.86] What we're going to have as sort of like a by-product of this product,
[1901.92 → 1902.88] just being what it is,
[1903.06 → 1906.24] is the best cooled battery bank on the market.
[1907.16 → 1911.12] Those cells are going to run so frosty cool.
[1911.12 → 1912.82] Because they're going to be actively cooled.
[1913.72 → 1914.86] I'm like very excited.
[1914.98 → 1916.28] Holiday on float plane says,
[1916.36 → 1919.22] so you started with a reasonable idea and then went full Linus.
[1919.40 → 1919.54] Lol.
[1920.94 → 1921.38] You,
[1921.42 → 1923.36] you turned into like full,
[1923.46 → 1928.16] like back of the showroom floor product shelf thing.
[1928.58 → 1929.76] So yeah,
[1929.76 → 1930.04] I,
[1930.14 → 1930.54] I,
[1930.78 → 1932.94] I was hoping that it would be,
[1933.28 → 1936.26] I was hoping it would be cheaper than what it will end up being.
[1936.26 → 1938.74] But my one month of battery life is sort of a
[1938.74 → 1940.04] a tough one.
[1940.04 → 1943.46] Like most of the cost is just in the batteries in the battery.
[1943.64 → 1944.08] Excuse me.
[1944.52 → 1945.04] These cells.
[1945.52 → 1945.92] Um,
[1945.96 → 1946.30] are you,
[1946.34 → 1950.38] are you willing and or interested in selling like lower about it?
[1950.38 → 1950.74] Cause like,
[1950.84 → 1952.06] do you really need a month?
[1952.08 → 1954.68] Like I could plug my gym bag in every week.
[1954.68 → 1956.22] Um,
[1956.34 → 1957.76] I think,
[1958.08 → 1959.18] I think for me,
[1959.26 → 1962.42] I want a month as for whether we could do like a
[1962.60 → 1964.78] because I don't want to like charge that all the time.
[1965.16 → 1965.92] It's annoying.
[1966.12 → 1968.52] Like the whole point of it is that it's like,
[1968.78 → 1970.34] how much more is it going to cost?
[1970.98 → 1971.24] Well,
[1971.28 → 1971.68] way more,
[1971.94 → 1972.42] obviously.
[1975.28 → 1976.74] Like three times as much,
[1976.84 → 1977.62] three times as much.
[1977.62 → 1978.08] Oh God.
[1978.08 → 1980.42] I would definitely not pay three times as much.
[1981.58 → 1981.94] Yeah,
[1981.98 → 1982.24] no,
[1982.36 → 1982.54] I,
[1982.68 → 1983.04] that's,
[1983.12 → 1983.48] I mean,
[1983.48 → 1983.98] I'm cheap.
[1984.10 → 1985.56] Maybe I'm not who you should be talking to.
[1985.64 → 1986.32] You're very cheap.
[1986.46 → 1987.34] I'm definitely not who you should be talking to.
[1987.34 → 1987.50] Yeah.
[1987.50 → 1988.12] You're very cheap.
[1988.36 → 1988.62] Okay.
[1988.62 → 1989.08] So guys,
[1989.16 → 1989.44] okay.
[1989.46 → 1989.92] Let me know.
[1989.96 → 1990.42] Let me know.
[1990.66 → 1991.24] Let me know.
[1991.24 → 1991.64] Does,
[1991.72 → 1993.84] does anyone else want a shoe dryer?
[1994.00 → 1994.22] Okay.
[1994.40 → 1995.12] Please draw pull this.
[1995.86 → 1996.30] I'm,
[1996.30 → 1997.72] I'm making it right now.
[1997.88 → 1999.26] I'm making it right now.
[1999.78 → 2000.46] Shoe dryer.
[2003.40 → 2004.70] If you post it in,
[2004.70 → 2005.00] in,
[2005.08 → 2005.32] on,
[2005.32 → 2007.38] on Twitch or float plane,
[2007.46 → 2008.66] I'll get it on the other one.
[2008.78 → 2009.16] All right,
[2009.18 → 2009.40] cool.
[2009.42 → 2010.50] I'm throwing it on float plane.
[2010.60 → 2011.78] Float plane votes first.
[2011.92 → 2012.42] Here we go.
[2012.58 → 2013.80] Advanced mail in,
[2013.96 → 2015.28] mail-in voting,
[2016.00 → 2017.58] early voting access,
[2017.70 → 2018.80] early access voting.
[2019.12 → 2019.66] All right.
[2019.66 → 2021.20] I got it in Twitch now.
[2021.94 → 2022.38] There you go.
[2022.38 → 2023.12] Ladies and gentlemen.
[2024.00 → 2025.88] And let's go ahead and throw it in YouTube chat.
[2025.96 → 2027.40] YouTube chat moves so fast.
[2027.46 → 2029.04] I don't even stand a chance here.
[2029.16 → 2029.32] You're,
[2029.32 → 2030.26] you're obviously not going to,
[2030.36 → 2031.28] Oh my God.
[2031.28 → 2032.58] I don't believe it at all.
[2032.70 → 2034.62] I don't believe it in the slightest.
[2034.80 → 2037.24] I'm getting trolled that I guarantee you.
[2037.28 → 2038.04] That's what this is.
[2038.10 → 2038.32] Whoa,
[2038.36 → 2038.52] whoa,
[2038.58 → 2038.78] whoa,
[2038.78 → 2038.86] whoa,
[2038.86 → 2039.00] whoa.
[2039.08 → 2041.46] Speaking of people buying things from LTT store.com.
[2041.52 → 2043.86] Did you see Luke adjusting himself in his chair there real quick?
[2043.94 → 2044.42] Their styles.
[2044.54 → 2044.70] Oh,
[2044.78 → 2045.14] Geez.
[2045.24 → 2045.90] Did you see that?
[2045.98 → 2046.70] Did you see that?
[2047.20 → 2047.60] Whoa,
[2047.92 → 2049.72] what is that?
[2049.98 → 2050.88] What is that?
[2050.88 → 2052.42] Is that a new item?
[2052.84 → 2053.24] What?
[2053.92 → 2054.58] Hold on a second.
[2054.68 → 2054.92] Let me,
[2055.14 → 2055.26] Oh,
[2055.46 → 2055.72] shoot.
[2055.80 → 2056.40] I think I just,
[2056.58 → 2057.04] Oh shoot.
[2057.06 → 2058.10] I think I just broke something.
[2058.22 → 2058.76] Oh boy.
[2059.22 → 2059.50] Well,
[2059.58 → 2061.66] I'm breaking stuff.
[2061.72 → 2062.38] I'm breaking stuff.
[2062.38 → 2063.02] Don't worry about it.
[2063.02 → 2063.34] Hold on.
[2063.34 → 2063.36] Hold on.
[2063.46 → 2063.76] I'll pick.
[2063.90 → 2064.18] Okay.
[2064.32 → 2064.60] All right.
[2064.60 → 2065.04] There we go.
[2065.08 → 2067.38] Let's go back to the where dang it.
[2067.40 → 2068.00] Where's the right one?
[2068.08 → 2068.62] Here it is.
[2069.26 → 2069.90] Oh yeah.
[2070.28 → 2072.94] Typists and gamers pick your flavour.
[2073.88 → 2076.22] We've got four different colours.
[2076.36 → 2077.02] We got blue.
[2077.14 → 2077.90] We got brown.
[2078.00 → 2078.74] We got red.
[2078.74 → 2079.96] We got black.
[2080.12 → 2082.36] The black is sick.
[2082.72 → 2083.58] Nice and stealthy.
[2083.62 → 2084.54] That's actually pretty cool.
[2084.66 → 2087.12] The black is absolutely sick.
[2087.58 → 2088.50] That one's at the bottom of the stack.
[2088.54 → 2089.06] I didn't even look at it.
[2089.08 → 2089.38] Because I was like,
[2089.40 → 2090.42] I got to wear the blue one.
[2091.10 → 2091.50] Yeah.
[2091.50 → 2091.90] I have to,
[2091.98 → 2093.08] you don't have to,
[2093.16 → 2095.00] you don't have to rep your,
[2095.10 → 2095.90] your preference.
[2096.52 → 2096.92] Um,
[2097.10 → 2097.64] it's just,
[2097.72 → 2098.62] it just doesn't hurt.
[2099.24 → 2099.42] Shoot.
[2099.54 → 2103.02] I would personally go with either rapping your preference or black.
[2103.86 → 2104.96] Cause the black one's cool.
[2105.46 → 2105.82] Uh,
[2106.08 → 2106.56] Oh no.
[2106.62 → 2107.26] What am I doing?
[2107.76 → 2108.24] Oh no.
[2108.28 → 2109.04] I moved my,
[2109.22 → 2109.38] Oh,
[2109.42 → 2110.02] where is it?
[2110.20 → 2111.18] I can't find it.
[2111.50 → 2112.12] Is this it?
[2112.72 → 2113.20] Oh no.
[2113.50 → 2113.84] And everything.
[2113.98 → 2114.28] Yeah.
[2114.28 → 2114.92] I broke,
[2114.92 → 2115.76] I broke everything.
[2115.86 → 2118.60] Can you control Z changes that you've made to a scene?
[2119.08 → 2119.84] If it OPS,
[2120.52 → 2121.40] I don't think so.
[2122.70 → 2123.10] Oh,
[2123.22 → 2124.22] what is this one?
[2124.40 → 2124.72] Oh yeah.
[2124.72 → 2125.54] There's your problem.
[2125.68 → 2125.98] Okay.
[2126.08 → 2127.34] So that'll go there.
[2127.66 → 2128.14] Uh,
[2128.20 → 2132.12] hopefully I kind of lined it up with the other thing and then that'll go.
[2132.36 → 2132.60] No,
[2132.60 → 2133.20] stop.
[2135.00 → 2136.06] This is horrible.
[2136.54 → 2137.22] This is horrible.
[2137.34 → 2137.90] I hate it.
[2138.00 → 2138.38] There we go.
[2138.48 → 2138.70] Can't even help.
[2138.80 → 2139.70] Because I've no idea what's happening.
[2139.82 → 2140.52] Put my thing here.
[2140.60 → 2140.72] Yeah.
[2140.72 → 2141.06] It doesn't,
[2141.16 → 2141.74] it doesn't matter.
[2141.82 → 2142.54] Don't worry about it.
[2142.54 → 2143.98] It just means when I switched to our sponsors,
[2143.98 → 2144.94] it's going to do that annoying,
[2145.12 → 2145.50] stupid thing.
[2145.54 → 2149.02] I just fixed it today after like weeks of not caring.
[2149.50 → 2149.80] All right.
[2149.82 → 2150.32] How about that?
[2150.44 → 2150.88] Oh wow.
[2150.88 → 2151.52] That's not too bad.
[2152.08 → 2152.26] Oh,
[2152.80 → 2153.52] that's a different thing.
[2153.82 → 2154.16] All right,
[2154.16 → 2154.40] cool.
[2154.40 → 2154.98] So guys,
[2155.10 → 2157.14] you want to go check that out by the way,
[2157.24 → 2158.34] in unrelated news,
[2158.76 → 2160.50] the foil keyboard shirts,
[2160.64 → 2162.40] there were three that were a little bit different.
[2162.60 → 2166.30] We've only been contacted by two of the recipients.
[2166.90 → 2170.12] So you guys got to make sure that your contact support,
[2170.12 → 2172.58] if your foil keyboard shirt looks a little,
[2172.72 → 2174.72] a little weird or a little different.
[2176.06 → 2176.68] All right.
[2176.80 → 2177.34] I wonder,
[2177.58 → 2182.96] it's very possible that someone bought one of those shirts as a Christmas gift.
[2184.22 → 2184.66] Oh,
[2184.72 → 2185.78] that does seem possible.
[2185.78 → 2187.12] Or a holiday present.
[2188.90 → 2189.34] Okay.
[2189.50 → 2189.66] Well,
[2189.68 → 2191.24] there's nothing I can really do about that.
[2191.42 → 2191.60] Oops.
[2191.68 → 2192.06] There we go.
[2192.48 → 2192.80] All right.
[2192.80 → 2193.08] Anyway,
[2193.20 → 2193.70] here's the
[2193.70 → 2194.00] uh,
[2194.00 → 2195.24] here's the keyboard shirt.
[2195.32 → 2196.50] If you guys didn't see it before,
[2196.50 → 2197.86] I think Luke was probably holding it up,
[2197.90 → 2198.92] but I had screen cap going.
[2199.12 → 2200.22] So there's the black one.
[2200.28 → 2200.98] There's the red one.
[2201.04 → 2201.66] Look at this guy.
[2201.90 → 2204.14] There's the blue one and the brown one.
[2205.02 → 2207.30] The black one actually has a little bit of shine in it.
[2207.54 → 2208.94] So we put some like,
[2209.00 → 2209.36] uh,
[2209.36 → 2211.36] some sparkle kind of dye in it.
[2211.36 → 2212.76] So it's not just black.
[2213.26 → 2213.46] Uh,
[2213.46 → 2215.36] the other ones are more just pure colours.
[2215.36 → 2218.28] And we tried to get them as close to the stem colour as we could.
[2218.78 → 2218.92] Luke,
[2218.98 → 2220.22] this is probably a stupid question,
[2220.22 → 2222.76] but do you happen to have a Cherry MX blue keyboard handy?
[2223.80 → 2224.16] Yes.
[2224.36 → 2225.20] Luke looks down.
[2225.74 → 2227.14] Luke looks down somewhere else.
[2227.24 → 2229.92] How many Cherry MX blue keyboards do you have handy?
[2230.06 → 2230.30] Luke,
[2230.48 → 2230.92] the friend here.
[2231.00 → 2231.34] Three.
[2232.26 → 2232.66] Three.
[2232.96 → 2233.48] What a nerd.
[2234.40 → 2234.64] Oh,
[2234.64 → 2235.54] that's why I love that guy.
[2236.54 → 2238.18] That's why I love that guy.
[2238.18 → 2239.30] Uh,
[2239.36 → 2239.70] yes.
[2240.00 → 2240.84] Gee holiday.
[2241.12 → 2241.98] It is red.
[2242.14 → 2243.50] It's very red in person.
[2245.48 → 2246.12] There we go.
[2246.18 → 2246.72] Cherry MX blue.
[2246.80 → 2248.42] So can we see the colour compared to the shirt?
[2249.22 → 2249.62] Hey,
[2249.86 → 2250.62] close enough.
[2250.86 → 2251.64] Looks good to me.
[2252.12 → 2252.38] All right.
[2252.86 → 2254.42] They're shrouded in,
[2254.44 → 2255.52] in black.
[2255.62 → 2256.08] Like it's,
[2256.20 → 2256.36] Oh yeah.
[2256.36 → 2257.42] It looks close.
[2257.96 → 2259.02] The colour is pretty close.
[2259.14 → 2259.30] Yeah.
[2259.32 → 2260.14] It's close enough.
[2260.22 → 2260.48] That was,
[2260.58 → 2261.34] that was what we were going for.
[2261.34 → 2262.26] It's not like perfect,
[2262.42 → 2263.10] but it's close enough.
[2263.88 → 2266.70] We have some rocket Lake details though.
[2267.16 → 2267.52] Uh,
[2267.52 → 2269.00] so this was posted by random person.
[2269.10 → 2269.26] One,
[2269.34 → 2269.44] two,
[2269.52 → 2269.64] three,
[2269.72 → 2270.42] four on the forum.
[2270.86 → 2274.28] Intel has been pretty quiet since AMD announced the rise in 5,000 series,
[2274.38 → 2276.84] dropping hints here and there that rocket Lake is coming.
[2277.20 → 2277.38] Well,
[2277.42 → 2278.64] now we've got details.
[2279.16 → 2284.14] The new 11th gen core CPUs codename rocket Lake will run in a new 500 series
[2284.14 → 2287.82] chipset and are using what Intel is calling Cypress Cove cores,
[2288.14 → 2293.30] which is essentially ice lake or sunny cove backported to 14 nanometers.
[2293.30 → 2294.30] Uh,
[2294.30 → 2305.48] not necessarily the greatest or most exciting time for them to have a processor launch.
[2305.68 → 2307.26] No specific models were announced,
[2307.50 → 2312.82] but Intel's famous up to marketing points to eight cores and 16 threads at the top of the line.
[2312.82 → 2314.00] Dr.
[2314.08 → 2314.92] Ian Sutra says,
[2315.04 → 2321.02] this is a balancing act for the inclusion of AVX 512 as part of the ice lake architecture that it's based on.
[2321.14 → 2321.54] So yes,
[2321.62 → 2325.84] AVX 512 is one of those things that for most consumers is not going to be particularly meaningful,
[2325.84 → 2333.08] but it's going to cost you two processing cores if you want to go rocket Lake instead of the current Comet Lake S lineup.
[2333.76 → 2337.84] New features include a memory controller capable of DDR4-3200 natively,
[2338.64 → 2339.76] PCI Express Gen 4,
[2340.10 → 2342.84] four more CPU PCI Express lanes for a total of 20,
[2342.92 → 2344.00] which is on par with Ry zen,
[2344.36 → 2347.50] a new UHD graphics core based on Tiger Lake HE,
[2347.88 → 2351.84] new media encoding engine support up to 4K60 12-bit 444H265.
[2351.84 → 2352.84] Dang!
[2354.46 → 2358.18] And up to 4K60 10-bit 420AV1,
[2358.58 → 2361.10] and up to three 4K60 displays.
[2361.32 → 2362.08] So that's pretty cool.
[2362.14 → 2363.26] Via DisplayPort 1.4a,
[2363.32 → 2364.06] HDMI 2.0b.
[2364.32 → 2364.56] Oh,
[2364.64 → 2364.78] no,
[2364.88 → 2366.30] no HDMI 2.1.
[2366.36 → 2366.48] Hey,
[2366.58 → 2367.40] that's kind of a bummer.
[2367.88 → 2369.70] Or DisplayPort HBR3,
[2369.78 → 2371.08] which can support 8K60.
[2371.60 → 2371.96] Ooh.
[2372.52 → 2374.16] It also has Intel deep learning boost.
[2374.60 → 2377.80] Intel is claiming a double-digit improvement in IPC gen over gen,
[2377.86 → 2380.88] and is focusing on clock speeds in its early marketing for 11th gen.
[2381.84 → 2384.70] One of the most interesting things about this to me
[2384.70 → 2386.48] is just that,
[2386.54 → 2386.70] like,
[2386.82 → 2387.88] we had this news,
[2388.06 → 2389.78] and people have been eating up processor news,
[2390.10 → 2391.28] like mad,
[2391.46 → 2392.52] for a long time now,
[2392.64 → 2393.08] even though,
[2393.14 → 2393.40] like,
[2394.12 → 2396.18] there haven't been a lot of experiences
[2396.18 → 2398.22] that are going to really fully utilize them.
[2398.28 → 2400.52] People have been really excited about processor news.
[2401.80 → 2404.82] This drops at a similar time to the big Nazi announcement,
[2405.04 → 2406.62] and just basically,
[2406.96 → 2407.86] no one noticed.
[2407.86 → 2418.04] That's pretty much all I got to say about that.
[2418.16 → 2419.76] That's pretty much that.
[2419.84 → 2420.06] All right,
[2420.12 → 2420.48] fair enough.
[2420.64 → 2422.38] We can go back to our straw poll results,
[2422.46 → 2422.56] though,
[2422.60 → 2422.80] now.
[2423.66 → 2424.88] The audience is divided.
[2425.56 → 2425.76] I,
[2426.00 → 2426.56] it's,
[2426.56 → 2427.94] these are divisive times.
[2428.94 → 2430.54] 48% say yes.
[2431.22 → 2431.64] That's one.
[2431.64 → 2432.16] Yes to what?
[2432.28 → 2433.18] What's the question?
[2433.32 → 2434.00] Shoe dryer.
[2435.22 → 2436.48] What's that mean?
[2436.98 → 2438.36] It means shoe dryer.
[2438.36 → 2442.62] I believe this is a brand-new market segment
[2442.62 → 2445.16] that's being totally underserved right now.
[2445.16 → 2445.96] Oh my God.
[2445.96 → 2448.72] The market for people who sweat a lot in their shoes
[2448.72 → 2449.94] and need to dry them out,
[2449.94 → 2454.26] because I ended up having to go buy a second pair of shoes
[2454.26 → 2456.06] so that I could alternate them
[2456.06 → 2457.52] if I'm playing too often.
[2457.92 → 2458.24] Otherwise,
[2458.52 → 2458.88] I have a question.
[2458.96 → 2459.36] I have a question.
[2459.56 → 2459.74] No,
[2459.82 → 2460.00] no,
[2460.08 → 2460.60] I'm not done yet.
[2460.60 → 2462.12] Was the second pair of shoes
[2462.12 → 2464.74] cheaper than the shoe dryer?
[2464.74 → 2465.74] No,
[2466.92 → 2467.04] no.
[2467.10 → 2468.44] My shoes are pretty expensive.
[2468.60 → 2470.40] I spend more on like badminton shoes for sure
[2470.40 → 2471.70] than like actual shoes that I wear.
[2472.52 → 2474.18] I also go through them a lot faster.
[2474.62 → 2475.18] So no,
[2475.34 → 2475.52] no,
[2475.58 → 2476.12] not necessarily.
[2476.30 → 2477.04] So here's what happened.
[2477.10 → 2477.60] Here's what happened.
[2477.86 → 2479.94] I ended up owning two pairs of shoes
[2479.94 → 2481.22] because my previous solution
[2481.22 → 2483.24] was to put them behind my server,
[2483.50 → 2483.80] actually,
[2483.92 → 2484.44] to dry them
[2484.44 → 2486.42] and then put them back in my bag.
[2486.76 → 2488.90] And then I forgot them once
[2488.90 → 2491.10] and I got to play,
[2491.44 → 2493.04] which is a 45-minute drive for me.
[2493.04 → 2494.04] I arrived
[2494.04 → 2494.58] and I was like,
[2494.72 → 2495.16] oh my,
[2495.58 → 2496.08] oh my God,
[2496.10 → 2497.38] I don't have badminton shoes
[2497.38 → 2498.54] and they won't let you on the court
[2498.54 → 2500.10] without non-marking shoes.
[2500.68 → 2502.78] So either I could drive an hour and a half
[2502.78 → 2503.72] to go get shoes
[2503.72 → 2505.50] and completely miss my session
[2505.50 → 2507.88] or I could just buy shoes
[2507.88 → 2508.98] while I was there.
[2509.02 → 2509.46] And I was like,
[2509.50 → 2509.72] okay,
[2509.78 → 2509.90] well,
[2509.90 → 2511.00] I guess this isn't that bad.
[2511.30 → 2512.76] I'll just have two pairs of shoes
[2512.76 → 2514.42] and then I'll just have one in my bag
[2514.42 → 2515.18] and one drying.
[2515.68 → 2517.52] It's part of the reason why pro shops like exist
[2517.52 → 2519.08] is to grab that type of customer.
[2519.40 → 2519.96] A hundred percent.
[2519.96 → 2521.90] They got me for like 120 bucks
[2521.90 → 2524.28] because I forgot my shoes.
[2524.82 → 2525.80] So it's pretty brutal.
[2526.76 → 2527.20] Yes,
[2527.24 → 2529.04] that server room did not smell great
[2529.04 → 2530.18] when I was using it as a shoe dryer.
[2530.26 → 2531.82] Although on the subject
[2531.82 → 2533.30] of shoes not smelling good,
[2533.78 → 2535.62] if you dry your shoes quickly,
[2535.62 → 2536.88] there's less opportunity
[2536.88 → 2537.94] for bacteria growth
[2537.94 → 2539.72] and the same can be said for your bag.
[2539.86 → 2541.52] Just having a little bit of airflow
[2541.52 → 2543.32] actually helps a ton.
[2544.34 → 2544.78] Interesting.
[2545.02 → 2545.14] Okay.
[2545.14 → 2548.28] So you could increase the lifespan.
[2549.66 → 2551.26] Apparently you can get the nerve
[2551.26 → 2552.58] to your sweat glands cut
[2552.58 → 2554.04] to stop sweating there forever.
[2555.48 → 2555.96] Wow.
[2556.66 → 2558.94] Science has officially gone too far.
[2559.36 → 2559.46] No,
[2559.52 → 2560.70] like sweating is a good thing.
[2562.44 → 2562.92] Hilarious.
[2563.66 → 2564.14] You like,
[2564.20 → 2565.22] you like want to sweat.
[2565.86 → 2567.08] People that have that thing,
[2567.14 → 2567.84] I don't remember what it is.
[2568.10 → 2569.04] It makes it so they can't sweat.
[2569.14 → 2569.42] That's like,
[2569.48 → 2570.32] that's like a problem.
[2570.78 → 2571.22] Huh?
[2571.90 → 2573.26] Like maybe gross and stuff,
[2573.26 → 2575.30] but it's good.
[2575.80 → 2576.16] Crazy town.
[2576.74 → 2577.20] All right.
[2578.48 → 2579.64] Speaking of crazy town,
[2579.74 → 2580.84] why don't we talk about our sponsors
[2580.84 → 2581.78] for the WAN show today?
[2582.46 → 2583.70] The WAN show is brought to you by
[2583.70 → 2584.62] Messi Footwear.
[2584.80 → 2585.14] Actually,
[2585.24 → 2586.06] let's do these in order.
[2586.44 → 2586.70] Hey,
[2586.80 → 2587.54] Messi Footwear.
[2587.70 → 2587.96] Thanks,
[2588.06 → 2588.36] Messi,
[2588.42 → 2589.98] for sponsoring today's WAN show.
[2590.42 → 2591.34] Messi Footwear is known
[2591.34 → 2592.46] for making comfortable shoes
[2592.46 → 2593.18] that are light
[2593.18 → 2594.54] and most importantly,
[2594.70 → 2595.64] water-resistant.
[2596.10 → 2597.64] You can walk in almost any terrain
[2597.64 → 2598.72] while keeping your feet dry.
[2599.00 → 2599.80] They just announced
[2599.80 → 2601.04] their new weekend shoe.
[2601.46 → 2602.04] They have a look
[2602.04 → 2603.24] that fits almost all occasions
[2603.24 → 2605.72] and you can get $25 off each pair
[2605.72 → 2606.96] with offer code WAN show.
[2607.30 → 2608.14] And in the event
[2608.14 → 2610.00] that you stepped in such a deep puddle
[2610.00 → 2611.10] that the water went up
[2611.10 → 2612.80] over the sides of your Messi shoes
[2612.80 → 2614.20] and poured into them,
[2614.64 → 2615.42] you could even,
[2615.54 → 2616.92] they are 100% compatible
[2616.92 → 2617.76] with the upcoming
[2617.76 → 2619.40] LTTstore.com shoe dryer.
[2619.78 → 2620.66] Check them out at
[2620.66 → 2622.48] Vessi.com slash WAN show.
[2622.78 → 2623.96] For our next sponsor,
[2624.26 → 2625.16] I have a video
[2625.16 → 2626.66] that I'm supposed to play, apparently.
[2626.92 → 2627.94] This is becoming
[2627.94 → 2629.32] a popular new way for,
[2629.46 → 2629.60] oh,
[2629.72 → 2629.88] oh,
[2629.88 → 2630.44] oh no,
[2630.44 → 2631.50] I've got the wrong thing here.
[2631.56 → 2631.76] Okay,
[2631.80 → 2632.28] here we go.
[2632.86 → 2633.10] Hey,
[2633.18 → 2633.78] there it is.
[2635.30 → 2635.70] Autonomous
[2635.70 → 2637.16] is the industry-leading producer
[2637.16 → 2638.38] of premium build office chairs
[2638.38 → 2639.28] and standing desks.
[2639.66 → 2640.46] Their Smart Desk 4
[2640.46 → 2641.84] is the first ever standing desk
[2641.84 → 2643.44] with an anti-collision feature
[2643.44 → 2644.42] that is user adjustable.
[2644.54 → 2644.98] That's right.
[2645.30 → 2646.32] You will not collide
[2646.32 → 2647.80] with your colleagues anymore.
[2648.36 → 2649.50] It also syncs with an app
[2649.50 → 2650.36] which not only lets you
[2650.36 → 2651.50] control the desk wirelessly,
[2651.70 → 2653.20] but allows you to schedule
[2653.20 → 2653.96] your sit, stand,
[2654.06 → 2655.28] and exercise sessions
[2655.28 → 2657.06] that fit your work routine perfectly.
[2657.06 → 2659.26] You can also learn your work habits
[2659.26 → 2660.36] with the app's analytics.
[2660.82 → 2662.22] It's the number one productivity hack
[2662.22 → 2663.24] for anyone working from home.
[2663.68 → 2665.08] And pre-orders for the Smart Desk 4
[2665.08 → 2666.46] will open on November 4th
[2666.46 → 2667.54] with one of our lucky viewers
[2667.54 → 2668.62] getting a chance to win one
[2668.62 → 2669.62] right now.
[2670.30 → 2671.30] Just go to the link
[2671.30 → 2672.56] in the video description.
[2673.24 → 2674.60] The fastest to tell us in the
[2674.64 → 2674.94] oh, wait,
[2675.04 → 2675.30] apparently,
[2675.46 → 2675.60] wait,
[2675.66 → 2675.82] what?
[2676.88 → 2677.18] Oh,
[2677.56 → 2677.98] okay.
[2678.40 → 2679.64] Who is admitting this?
[2679.74 → 2680.78] Apparently the fastest
[2680.78 → 2682.28] to tell us in the live chat
[2682.28 → 2684.98] what the two new Smart Desk 4 features are
[2684.98 → 2687.18] wins a Smart Desk 4.
[2687.78 → 2689.72] This is a bad system for this.
[2691.88 → 2693.26] How the hell
[2693.26 → 2694.26] were we going to
[2694.26 → 2695.32] administrate this?
[2695.50 → 2696.80] I would assume it would,
[2697.06 → 2699.58] you know what?
[2699.88 → 2700.74] We'll figure out the giveaway.
[2700.96 → 2701.04] No,
[2701.14 → 2701.76] forget it.
[2701.80 → 2702.46] The giveaway is off.
[2702.52 → 2703.72] We'll do the giveaway next week.
[2704.40 → 2705.78] We'll do the giveaway next week.
[2705.82 → 2706.56] We'll figure it out.
[2707.44 → 2708.06] It's off.
[2708.10 → 2708.44] It's off.
[2708.48 → 2709.32] We'll do it next week.
[2711.04 → 2711.44] Oh,
[2711.50 → 2711.78] man.
[2711.96 → 2712.22] Okay.
[2712.66 → 2713.34] Why don't we go?
[2713.34 → 2715.10] That was quite the YOLO
[2715.10 → 2715.82] just thrown in
[2715.82 → 2716.74] at the end of the notes.
[2717.30 → 2718.76] Did not think that one through.
[2720.02 → 2720.54] All right.
[2720.58 → 2721.40] Apple's been sued.
[2721.98 → 2724.16] Is privacy anti-competitive?
[2724.34 → 2725.24] Original article here
[2725.24 → 2726.68] is from macrumors.com.
[2726.74 → 2727.34] In 2021,
[2727.64 → 2729.26] iOS 14 will require apps
[2729.26 → 2730.38] to get opt-in permission
[2730.38 → 2730.96] from users
[2730.96 → 2731.94] to collect
[2731.94 → 2733.90] their random advertising identifier,
[2734.38 → 2735.72] which advertisers use
[2735.72 → 2737.12] to deliver personalized ads
[2737.12 → 2738.22] and track how effective
[2738.22 → 2739.24] their campaigns were.
[2740.20 → 2741.22] Ahead of this change,
[2741.38 → 2742.08] advertising companies
[2742.08 → 2742.54] and publishers
[2742.54 → 2743.64] have filed a complaint
[2743.64 → 2744.64] against Apple
[2744.64 → 2746.10] with France's competition authority
[2746.10 → 2747.10] arguing that the enhanced
[2747.10 → 2747.80] privacy measures
[2747.80 → 2749.58] would be anti-competitive.
[2750.22 → 2750.60] The complaint
[2750.60 → 2751.66] alleges
[2751.66 → 2752.72] that the wording of Apple's
[2752.72 → 2753.34] permission prompt
[2753.34 → 2754.26] will lead most users
[2754.26 → 2755.62] to decline tracking
[2755.62 → 2756.46] of their device's
[2756.46 → 2757.52] advertising identifier,
[2757.84 → 2758.46] which could result
[2758.46 → 2760.18] in lost revenue.
[2760.92 → 2762.14] Lost revenue
[2762.14 → 2763.66] for advertisers.
[2763.66 → 2766.32] Oh, no.
[2766.50 → 2767.40] Oh, jeez.
[2767.54 → 2768.04] In August,
[2768.38 → 2769.84] Facebook warned advertisers
[2769.84 → 2770.50] that the prompt
[2770.50 → 2771.36] could lead to a more than
[2771.36 → 2773.18] 50% drop in audience
[2773.18 → 2774.70] network publisher revenue.
[2775.20 → 2776.36] Yeah, you get wrecked, Facebook.
[2776.76 → 2777.38] In a statement,
[2777.78 → 2779.30] Apple reiterated its belief
[2779.30 → 2779.86] that privacy
[2779.86 → 2780.92] is a fundamental right,
[2781.02 → 2781.78] adding that
[2781.78 → 2784.82] if people don't bring
[2784.82 → 2785.32] their phones
[2785.32 → 2786.78] to an Apple Store,
[2787.08 → 2788.02] they shouldn't really
[2788.02 → 2789.06] be allowed to fix them anyway,
[2789.12 → 2789.48] should they?
[2789.94 → 2790.44] Sorry, no,
[2790.44 → 2791.24] that's not what they said.
[2791.80 → 2792.88] Have you seen all the stuff
[2792.88 → 2793.82] with the new iPhone 12?
[2795.10 → 2796.06] I've seen some of it.
[2796.06 → 2796.26] Yeah.
[2796.26 → 2796.88] I don't know if I've seen
[2796.88 → 2797.72] all of it, but yeah.
[2797.90 → 2798.86] It's still rumoured,
[2798.98 → 2799.84] but it looks like,
[2799.96 → 2800.84] actually,
[2800.92 → 2802.24] I think displays are confirmed
[2802.24 → 2804.08] that they are tied
[2804.08 → 2805.10] to the SoC.
[2805.34 → 2806.22] And then I think
[2806.22 → 2806.76] it's rumoured
[2806.76 → 2807.76] that camera modules
[2807.76 → 2808.34] in the 12
[2808.34 → 2808.92] might be tied
[2808.92 → 2809.92] to the SoC as well,
[2810.38 → 2810.98] which is like
[2810.98 → 2812.42] totally arbitrary
[2812.42 → 2813.06] and unnecessary.
[2813.70 → 2813.94] Anyway,
[2814.16 → 2815.08] no, in a statement,
[2815.22 → 2816.06] Apple reiterated
[2816.06 → 2816.64] its belief
[2816.64 → 2817.20] that privacy
[2817.20 → 2818.26] is a fundamental right,
[2818.36 → 2818.94] adding that
[2818.94 → 2819.92] a user's data
[2819.92 → 2820.74] belongs to them
[2820.74 → 2821.38] and they should get
[2821.38 → 2821.80] to decide
[2821.80 → 2822.32] whether to share
[2822.32 → 2822.70] their data
[2822.70 → 2823.70] and with whom.
[2824.26 → 2824.62] Apple said
[2824.62 → 2825.64] its own data collection
[2825.64 → 2826.76] doesn't count as tracking
[2826.76 → 2827.56] because it doesn't share
[2827.56 → 2828.60] the data with other companies.
[2832.12 → 2832.52] Okay.
[2833.18 → 2833.66] See, if Apple
[2833.66 → 2834.46] just didn't collect
[2834.46 → 2834.92] this data,
[2835.04 → 2835.76] then they would have
[2835.76 → 2836.78] a stronger leg
[2836.78 → 2837.34] to stand on.
[2837.74 → 2838.28] So they say,
[2838.34 → 2839.12] only we can benefit
[2839.12 → 2839.62] from your data.
[2839.76 → 2840.04] I also,
[2840.32 → 2840.46] like,
[2840.58 → 2841.52] as much as,
[2841.64 → 2841.96] and like,
[2842.10 → 2842.54] you know what?
[2842.90 → 2843.30] Sometimes,
[2843.48 → 2844.36] even when they find
[2844.36 → 2844.86] a way to make
[2844.86 → 2845.60] a personal gain,
[2846.04 → 2847.08] you can applaud
[2847.08 → 2848.02] companies'
[2848.66 → 2848.98] attempts
[2848.98 → 2850.10] to do things
[2850.10 → 2850.72] for the people
[2850.72 → 2851.70] because you might as well
[2851.70 → 2852.52] and if they can find
[2852.52 → 2852.84] some way
[2852.84 → 2853.42] to make it benefit
[2853.42 → 2853.86] themselves,
[2854.06 → 2855.30] then that's great.
[2855.64 → 2857.38] But this very,
[2857.50 → 2858.06] very much
[2858.06 → 2858.86] just seems like
[2858.86 → 2859.34] an attack
[2859.34 → 2860.34] on Google.
[2861.12 → 2862.24] Apple's position here
[2862.24 → 2863.28] says Conan Judo
[2863.28 → 2864.56] over in the float plane chat
[2864.56 → 2865.44] doesn't really square
[2865.44 → 2866.12] with them building
[2866.12 → 2867.14] their own search engine
[2867.14 → 2867.78] and ad network.
[2869.80 → 2870.24] Yeah,
[2870.38 → 2871.54] they're just fighting Google.
[2872.36 → 2872.80] Yeah,
[2872.88 → 2873.18] cool.
[2873.28 → 2873.42] Oh,
[2873.48 → 2873.94] and apparently
[2873.94 → 2875.48] that is confirmed,
[2875.80 → 2876.60] the display
[2876.60 → 2877.14] and camera,
[2877.20 → 2877.28] wait,
[2877.34 → 2877.42] no,
[2877.46 → 2877.82] I don't think
[2877.82 → 2878.42] the camera one
[2878.42 → 2879.12] is confirmed.
[2879.52 → 2879.72] Okay,
[2879.78 → 2880.58] I don't want to,
[2880.58 → 2881.32] I don't want to put
[2881.32 → 2882.16] my foot in my mouth here
[2882.16 → 2882.66] so I'm just not
[2882.66 → 2883.30] going to say anything.
[2883.66 → 2884.10] If I'm going to put
[2884.10 → 2884.72] my foot somewhere,
[2884.80 → 2885.16] it's going to be
[2885.16 → 2885.98] in a dry shoe.
[2887.52 → 2887.92] Hey!
[2890.78 → 2891.60] Apple said that
[2891.60 → 2892.26] the prompt will be
[2892.26 → 2893.16] displayed on an app
[2893.16 → 2894.48] by app basis
[2894.48 → 2896.14] and Apple already
[2896.14 → 2897.42] delayed the introduction
[2897.42 → 2897.90] of the prompt
[2897.90 → 2898.86] until early 2021
[2898.86 → 2899.78] to provide developers
[2899.78 → 2900.42] with more time
[2900.42 → 2901.60] to make the necessary changes.
[2902.22 → 2902.32] Now,
[2902.32 → 2902.62] I would,
[2902.66 → 2902.92] I would,
[2903.00 → 2903.72] I would like this
[2903.72 → 2904.52] slightly different
[2904.52 → 2905.24] in a way that would
[2905.24 → 2906.08] piss the other people
[2906.08 → 2906.86] that aren't Apple off
[2906.86 → 2907.36] even more
[2907.36 → 2909.54] and that would be
[2909.54 → 2910.92] to just have one,
[2911.08 → 2911.26] like,
[2911.58 → 2911.74] sure,
[2911.88 → 2912.08] okay,
[2912.12 → 2912.62] by default
[2912.62 → 2913.22] it could be
[2913.22 → 2914.02] app by app basis
[2914.02 → 2914.76] but I would love
[2914.76 → 2915.92] to just have one override
[2915.92 → 2916.48] that's just like,
[2916.56 → 2916.68] yep,
[2916.76 → 2917.48] just don't share it ever.
[2917.76 → 2918.10] Screw them.
[2918.80 → 2919.52] That would be nice.
[2919.54 → 2921.38] I don't want targeted ads.
[2921.82 → 2922.66] You're still going to get ads.
[2924.50 → 2925.34] Just to be clear.
[2926.24 → 2926.64] Oops,
[2926.78 → 2927.22] my bad.
[2927.34 → 2927.52] Sorry,
[2927.60 → 2927.78] anger,
[2927.84 → 2928.38] Panda PC.
[2928.66 → 2929.30] I fixed it.
[2929.70 → 2931.22] Camera is apparently confirmed.
[2931.58 → 2931.90] Okay,
[2932.02 → 2932.60] there you go.
[2932.82 → 2933.34] So that's
[2933.34 → 2934.76] terrible news.
[2935.24 → 2936.04] So much for
[2936.04 → 2936.78] right to repair.
[2936.94 → 2937.38] See you later.
[2937.94 → 2938.68] What about right
[2938.68 → 2939.72] to not sign in to Facebook
[2939.72 → 2941.00] on the Oculus Quest 2?
[2941.46 → 2942.90] Turns out it was jailbroken already.
[2943.34 → 2944.14] A VR researcher
[2944.14 → 2945.20] claims to have discovered
[2945.20 → 2947.62] a successful Oculus Quest 2 jailbreak
[2947.62 → 2948.82] giving rude access to the device.
[2948.88 → 2949.70] How long has this thing been out?
[2949.74 → 2950.28] Like two weeks?
[2951.22 → 2951.76] Not long,
[2951.96 → 2952.52] but the
[2953.24 → 2953.50] okay,
[2953.58 → 2953.72] sorry,
[2953.80 → 2954.04] keep going.
[2954.10 → 2954.24] No,
[2954.30 → 2954.40] no,
[2954.40 → 2956.00] I want to hear your part of the story
[2956.00 → 2956.68] because it's exciting.
[2956.80 → 2957.34] It's the best part.
[2958.12 → 2959.80] Almost immediately on Twitter,
[2960.18 → 2960.40] Palmer,
[2960.54 → 2960.78] Lucky,
[2960.98 → 2961.88] and others
[2961.88 → 2964.52] offered jailbreaking bounties.
[2965.24 → 2966.38] For people that would jailbreak
[2966.38 → 2967.04] this device.
[2967.78 → 2968.90] It looks like
[2968.90 → 2971.50] WebXR developer Robert Long
[2971.50 → 2973.66] offered a $5,000 reward
[2973.66 → 2975.98] for jailbreaking the Quest 2,
[2976.08 → 2977.38] a bounty that Oculus Rift
[2977.38 → 2978.06] inventor Palmer
[2978.06 → 2979.12] Lucky claimed he would match.
[2979.20 → 2979.34] Okay,
[2979.40 → 2980.82] so I guess it was Robert Long first.
[2981.88 → 2984.40] I even thought about jumping in,
[2984.52 → 2986.18] but I wasn't going to jump in that high,
[2986.32 → 2987.40] and the amount that I was willing
[2987.40 → 2988.04] to jump in at
[2988.04 → 2989.02] was pathetic,
[2989.24 → 2990.66] so I just decided to not bother.
[2990.66 → 2990.92] $5,000.
[2991.46 → 2991.72] Yeah.
[2991.98 → 2992.88] If there was some,
[2992.92 → 2993.06] like,
[2993.14 → 2993.88] GoFundMe,
[2994.12 → 2994.80] and that would have,
[2994.80 → 2995.02] like,
[2995.06 → 2995.84] gone towards it,
[2995.88 → 2996.24] I would have,
[2996.24 → 2997.38] I would have chipped in something.
[2997.56 → 2997.84] Just be,
[2998.00 → 2998.56] just as a
[2998.68 → 2998.82] like,
[2999.10 → 2999.90] screw you guys.
[3000.18 → 3000.32] Like,
[3000.34 → 3001.74] I don't even want an Oculus Quest 2,
[3001.76 → 3002.52] and I'm not going to get one.
[3003.48 → 3003.84] But,
[3004.04 → 3004.32] yeah,
[3004.32 → 3005.92] I love that this happened.
[3006.12 → 3006.14] I've tried it.
[3006.14 → 3007.00] It's very compelling.
[3007.74 → 3008.04] It's,
[3008.16 → 3008.26] like,
[3008.32 → 3009.10] very compelling.
[3009.84 → 3010.24] I mean,
[3010.26 → 3011.30] you already have an index.
[3011.42 → 3011.88] I have an index.
[3011.88 → 3012.32] So it's,
[3012.32 → 3013.20] it's irrelevant for you,
[3013.26 → 3013.60] I guess.
[3014.06 → 3014.36] But,
[3014.48 → 3014.76] yeah.
[3015.66 → 3016.88] It's very compelling.
[3017.54 → 3017.90] It's,
[3017.90 → 3018.28] like,
[3018.66 → 3018.98] whew.
[3019.52 → 3019.76] Like,
[3019.80 → 3021.26] if you have a Facebook account anyway,
[3021.40 → 3021.84] and you don't,
[3021.90 → 3022.04] like,
[3022.22 → 3022.82] give a hoot,
[3023.22 → 3023.48] oh,
[3023.56 → 3023.68] yeah.
[3023.80 → 3026.78] In the interest of FTC disclosure guidelines,
[3027.28 → 3029.70] our Oculus Quest 2 video that's coming is sponsored.
[3030.22 → 3031.94] So I need to make sure you guys know that.
[3032.04 → 3032.76] But this is,
[3032.84 → 3035.18] this is just not part of our agreement with them.
[3035.26 → 3036.78] So this is just me talking off the cuff,
[3036.84 → 3037.16] and there's,
[3037.58 → 3039.32] the odds are exactly zero
[3039.32 → 3041.64] that anyone working on that deal from the agency
[3041.64 → 3042.78] or whatever is looking at this.
[3042.78 → 3043.76] So I don't even care.
[3044.12 → 3045.24] It's very compelling.
[3045.24 → 3046.82] I've also heard that,
[3046.82 → 3047.16] like,
[3047.82 → 3050.06] well,
[3050.14 → 3050.92] I'm,
[3050.98 → 3051.52] I'm here,
[3051.64 → 3054.52] and I'm for pooping on Facebook all day,
[3054.60 → 3055.00] every day.
[3055.16 → 3057.72] But I have heard that while there are reports
[3057.72 → 3059.42] of people getting banned for no reason,
[3059.64 → 3060.10] and,
[3060.10 → 3060.34] and,
[3060.34 → 3060.52] like,
[3060.56 → 3061.66] there's that guy that had,
[3061.74 → 3061.86] like,
[3061.92 → 3063.94] literally never posted anything
[3063.94 → 3065.88] or done anything on his Facebook account ever,
[3065.94 → 3066.74] and he got banned,
[3066.88 → 3068.00] and all this other jazz.
[3068.40 → 3070.56] I've heard it's relatively few and far between.
[3071.42 → 3072.08] And it's not,
[3072.18 → 3072.24] like,
[3072.30 → 3073.40] actually a problem that,
[3073.44 → 3074.60] that a
[3074.60 → 3076.50] a very noticeable amount of consumers is having.
[3076.62 → 3078.18] I don't know how true that is.
[3078.18 → 3079.64] I'm sure people on,
[3079.72 → 3079.78] like,
[3079.80 → 3080.88] the Oculus Subreddit and stuff
[3080.88 → 3082.72] would like to step in there more.
[3082.84 → 3084.18] I haven't been paying too much attention to it
[3084.18 → 3084.46] because,
[3084.90 → 3085.50] like you said,
[3085.88 → 3086.60] I have an index.
[3087.64 → 3088.52] So I don't,
[3088.60 → 3089.62] I don't really care that much.
[3089.72 → 3091.90] But I just think it's absolutely amazing
[3091.90 → 3093.58] that people came together
[3093.58 → 3095.38] to support someone jailbreaking this,
[3095.48 → 3096.60] and I think it's absolutely amazing
[3096.60 → 3097.22] that it happened.
[3097.78 → 3098.62] And it's just fantastic.
[3098.62 → 3098.98] So quickly.
[3099.28 → 3099.82] I love it.
[3100.08 → 3100.26] Yep.
[3100.26 → 3101.54] To be clear,
[3101.54 → 3103.70] I'm still not recommending that you run out
[3103.70 → 3105.06] and jailbreak your device.
[3105.20 → 3106.78] We have no idea what this means
[3106.78 → 3107.70] for the long term of,
[3107.80 → 3107.86] like,
[3107.92 → 3109.52] software updates and stuff like that.
[3109.88 → 3110.32] Yeah.
[3110.48 → 3112.02] But the fact that it's possible,
[3112.46 → 3112.84] I mean,
[3112.84 → 3114.48] the thing is so cheap
[3114.48 → 3115.50] that at least there's,
[3115.64 → 3115.68] like,
[3115.76 → 3116.92] relatively little risk.
[3117.34 → 3117.58] I mean,
[3117.58 → 3118.34] it's still $300.
[3118.72 → 3119.38] Don't get me wrong.
[3119.46 → 3119.62] It's,
[3119.68 → 3120.86] it's an expensive toy.
[3120.86 → 3122.42] But compared to,
[3122.42 → 3123.46] like,
[3123.72 → 3126.58] previous VR headsets of this grade,
[3126.70 → 3126.78] like,
[3126.86 → 3128.08] the lenses are great.
[3128.64 → 3130.52] Oculus has always had better lenses
[3130.52 → 3131.26] than anyone else,
[3131.32 → 3132.30] and it's still got it.
[3132.58 → 3135.78] The pixel density is a step up from last gen,
[3135.96 → 3136.20] like,
[3136.32 → 3138.12] a noticeable step up from last gen.
[3138.38 → 3141.34] The fact that you can flip between wireless,
[3141.60 → 3141.76] like,
[3141.82 → 3142.70] standalone mode,
[3142.78 → 3145.00] and then wired with a USB-C cable
[3145.00 → 3147.08] so seamlessly and quickly
[3147.08 → 3148.52] is really cool.
[3149.30 → 3150.14] 72 hertz.
[3150.86 → 3151.44] Real bummer.
[3151.64 → 3153.14] But it's a 90 hertz display,
[3153.32 → 3154.38] and apparently 90 hertz
[3154.38 → 3156.64] will be unlocked officially moving forward
[3156.64 → 3157.60] at some point.
[3158.14 → 3160.52] And it's already been hacked as well, so.
[3162.60 → 3162.96] Fantastic.
[3163.46 → 3163.64] Someone,
[3163.78 → 3164.44] someone in the
[3164.44 → 3165.00] Gondola,
[3165.16 → 3165.46] in the
[3165.46 → 3166.30] in the Flow plane chat
[3166.30 → 3167.80] mentioned the fact that it's happening
[3167.80 → 3168.54] at all is bad.
[3168.78 → 3169.64] And what he means by that
[3169.64 → 3169.92] is, like,
[3169.92 → 3171.26] the weird random dance from Facebook
[3171.26 → 3172.54] not being able to use your VR device
[3172.54 → 3173.28] and all this other kind of stuff.
[3173.60 → 3175.16] Oh, I strongly agree.
[3175.28 → 3175.88] Don't get me wrong.
[3176.16 → 3176.40] For sure.
[3176.40 → 3176.84] I'm just saying,
[3177.20 → 3177.56] it,
[3177.76 → 3179.48] most users aren't experiencing that.
[3179.48 → 3179.98] And weird,
[3179.98 → 3182.10] weird random VAC bands are bad, too.
[3183.20 → 3183.42] Yep.
[3183.70 → 3183.92] Yeah,
[3184.04 → 3184.24] like,
[3184.30 → 3184.76] that's bad.
[3184.88 → 3186.60] But it's also just not unique
[3186.60 → 3187.14] to Facebook
[3187.14 → 3188.74] or the Oculus Quest 2.
[3189.22 → 3189.76] It's true.
[3189.88 → 3190.74] And it should have never happened,
[3190.80 → 3191.70] and Facebook should have had
[3191.70 → 3191.98] their,
[3191.98 → 3193.30] their grubby fingers
[3193.30 → 3194.74] not in there
[3194.74 → 3195.94] at any point in time.
[3195.94 → 3196.86] but it,
[3196.86 → 3197.50] it's,
[3197.50 → 3198.06] it's a thing.
[3198.22 → 3198.36] We're,
[3198.48 → 3199.40] we live in this world now.
[3200.02 → 3200.38] Um,
[3200.46 → 3201.90] speaking of worlds we live in,
[3202.16 → 3202.42] pfft,
[3202.54 → 3202.94] retina.
[3203.36 → 3205.58] 10,000 pixels per inch display developed.
[3205.76 → 3206.20] This was,
[3206.30 → 3206.54] uh,
[3206.54 → 3208.06] from the Stanford News Brief.
[3208.44 → 3210.24] One of the biggest problems with VR
[3210.24 → 3212.08] is the screen door effect
[3212.08 → 3213.52] or the gaps between pixels
[3213.52 → 3214.10] that you noticed
[3214.10 → 3214.98] when looking at a display
[3214.98 → 3216.00] that's so close to your eyes.
[3216.28 → 3216.56] Well,
[3216.98 → 3218.56] it may soon be a thing of the past.
[3219.06 → 3219.90] Samsung and Stanford
[3219.90 → 3222.00] have made a 10,000 pixel per inch display
[3222.00 → 3223.84] that could lead to flawless VR.
[3224.10 → 3225.62] Assuming we had the graphics horsepower
[3225.62 → 3226.66] to drive the friggin' thing.
[3227.16 → 3227.36] The new,
[3227.44 → 3227.56] Yeah.
[3228.10 → 3229.50] OLED tech uses films
[3229.50 → 3230.46] to emit white light
[3230.46 → 3232.00] between reflective layers.
[3232.62 → 3233.06] One,
[3233.98 → 3234.42] silver,
[3234.58 → 3236.10] and another made of reflective metal
[3236.10 → 3238.12] with hand-sized corrugations.
[3238.30 → 3239.56] NATO-corrugations!
[3240.28 → 3242.54] This optical meta-surface,
[3243.00 → 3243.26] man,
[3243.52 → 3244.70] these words are so great,
[3245.14 → 3246.48] changes the reflective properties
[3246.48 → 3247.66] and allows specific colours
[3247.66 → 3249.08] to resonate through pixels.
[3249.60 → 3251.64] The design allows for much higher pixel densities
[3251.64 → 3253.50] than you see in RGB Olds on phones,
[3253.56 → 3254.78] but doesn't hurt brightness
[3254.78 → 3255.78] to the degree that you see
[3255.78 → 3256.94] with white Olds in TVs.
[3257.64 → 3258.94] Would that be easier to push as well?
[3259.02 → 3259.12] Like,
[3259.18 → 3260.70] if they're just reflecting things,
[3260.74 → 3261.58] are you pushing?
[3261.58 → 3261.82] No,
[3261.88 → 3262.54] they're still pixels.
[3263.04 → 3263.96] In addition to having
[3263.96 → 3265.20] a record-setting pixel density,
[3265.34 → 3267.00] the new metaphotonic OLED
[3267.00 → 3268.38] would be brighter
[3268.38 → 3269.66] with better colour accuracy
[3269.66 → 3270.50] than existing ones
[3270.50 → 3271.74] and easier
[3271.74 → 3273.00] and more cost-effective to produce.
[3273.38 → 3274.10] This sounds like,
[3274.10 → 3275.52] it sounds like carbon nanotubes
[3275.52 → 3276.04] at this point.
[3276.44 → 3276.74] Yeah.
[3276.84 → 3277.66] It's going to be better
[3277.66 → 3278.58] and cheaper
[3278.58 → 3279.62] and easier.
[3279.96 → 3280.94] You're going to love it.
[3280.94 → 3282.24] Once we can make
[3282.24 → 3284.02] more than one of them.
[3285.16 → 3286.06] Samsung is apparently
[3286.06 → 3287.16] already working
[3287.16 → 3288.68] on a full-size display
[3288.68 → 3290.82] using this 10,000 pixel per inch tech
[3290.82 → 3292.46] and the design of the corrugations
[3292.46 → 3294.26] makes large-scale manufacturing viable.
[3294.48 → 3294.66] Wow.
[3295.02 → 3295.36] So,
[3295.44 → 3297.10] this may just be a question of when
[3297.10 → 3298.14] and where
[3298.14 → 3299.20] rather than if.
[3300.06 → 3300.52] That's awesome.
[3300.88 → 3301.20] That's pretty,
[3301.20 → 3302.42] that's pretty exciting.
[3302.98 → 3304.16] Speaking of when and where,
[3304.28 → 3305.40] you should check out that next link.
[3306.40 → 3307.34] The Verge.
[3307.78 → 3308.48] Oh yeah,
[3308.52 → 3309.12] I saw this.
[3309.12 → 3310.74] So hilarious.
[3311.40 → 3311.58] Yeah.
[3313.76 → 3314.28] Amazon,
[3314.82 → 3318.06] Amazon's brand new Racer phones
[3318.06 → 3319.28] have a fingerprint warning.
[3319.38 → 3319.80] We apologize
[3319.80 → 3320.76] if you see fingerprints
[3320.76 → 3321.54] on your device.
[3322.24 → 3323.42] Amazon apparently
[3323.42 → 3325.60] was unboxing phones
[3325.60 → 3326.68] and folding them
[3326.68 → 3327.40] for customers
[3327.40 → 3329.02] to reduce the odds
[3329.02 → 3329.94] of them being,
[3330.30 → 3331.12] of them arriving
[3331.12 → 3332.22] with shipping damage.
[3332.80 → 3333.24] They said,
[3333.32 → 3333.64] unquote,
[3333.76 → 3334.30] we apologize
[3334.30 → 3335.34] if you see fingerprints
[3335.34 → 3336.28] on your device.
[3336.42 → 3336.58] Wait.
[3336.74 → 3336.96] Oh no,
[3337.02 → 3337.66] hold on a second.
[3337.66 → 3339.36] Motorola now tells
[3339.36 → 3339.78] The Verge
[3339.78 → 3340.70] that it's the one
[3340.70 → 3341.32] doing the folding.
[3342.10 → 3342.90] Motorola is packaging
[3342.90 → 3343.48] the new Racer
[3343.48 → 3344.34] in its closed form
[3344.34 → 3345.14] at the factory level.
[3345.28 → 3345.80] Once the device
[3345.80 → 3346.52] leaves our facilities,
[3346.66 → 3347.48] it is not reopened.
[3348.10 → 3348.74] Motorola places
[3348.74 → 3349.54] strict requirements
[3349.54 → 3350.42] on handling with gloves
[3350.42 → 3351.38] and sanitation procedures
[3351.38 → 3352.36] along with shipping protocols.
[3352.48 → 3352.86] We will continue
[3352.86 → 3353.50] to closely monitor.
[3353.58 → 3353.90] Wait, what?
[3354.36 → 3355.28] That doesn't add up.
[3356.00 → 3356.38] Yeah,
[3356.44 → 3356.94] that's actually
[3356.94 → 3357.54] the next line
[3357.54 → 3358.30] of the article here.
[3358.56 → 3359.12] There's something
[3359.12 → 3359.68] doesn't add up.
[3359.72 → 3360.42] If they're being packaged
[3360.42 → 3361.16] at the factory level
[3361.16 → 3361.98] by people with gloves,
[3362.04 → 3363.12] why would we be warned
[3363.12 → 3363.72] about fingerprints?
[3365.70 → 3366.14] Okay.
[3367.70 → 3368.84] There's a specific incident
[3368.84 → 3369.60] that caused the shift.
[3369.74 → 3369.86] Okay,
[3369.90 → 3370.08] well,
[3370.14 → 3370.70] either way,
[3371.10 → 3372.38] if you're buying
[3372.38 → 3373.30] a Motorola Razr,
[3373.36 → 3374.36] you're doing it wrong anyway.
[3374.58 → 3375.52] So most of you people
[3375.52 → 3376.04] watching this
[3376.04 → 3377.06] are probably more savvy
[3377.06 → 3377.44] than that
[3377.44 → 3378.00] and didn't buy
[3378.00 → 3378.78] a Motorola Razr.
[3379.12 → 3379.82] So it should be fine.
[3379.96 → 3380.32] The nostalgia
[3380.32 → 3382.04] of your old school Razor
[3382.04 → 3383.96] from the early,
[3384.12 → 3384.94] mid-2000s
[3384.94 → 3385.74] is not worth it.
[3385.94 → 3386.14] Yeah,
[3386.36 → 3387.84] to buy a Lenovo phone
[3387.84 → 3389.52] that has a mediocre camera.
[3389.72 → 3391.04] I don't really understand.
[3391.04 → 3392.68] If you absolutely must
[3392.68 → 3394.14] have a folding candy bar phone,
[3394.20 → 3395.20] then just get a Z Flip.
[3396.40 → 3396.64] Yep.
[3396.72 → 3398.62] If you must have one.
[3398.86 → 3400.04] Why you must have one,
[3400.26 → 3402.12] I can't fathom it.
[3402.42 → 3403.82] But if you must.
[3406.34 → 3406.78] Oh,
[3406.84 → 3407.32] this is weird.
[3407.46 → 3408.58] Super chat seemed to be broken.
[3409.30 → 3411.46] That is super unfortunate.
[3411.64 → 3412.54] I can only see the ones
[3412.54 → 3413.74] from 657 and on.
[3414.12 → 3415.38] Don't resend them though,
[3415.44 → 3415.74] guys.
[3416.12 → 3417.94] I do see Haze Buster.
[3418.06 → 3418.88] Much love from Germany.
[3418.98 → 3419.62] Thank you for that.
[3421.04 → 3422.76] And Blida says,
[3422.84 → 3423.50] I know this won't be read
[3423.50 → 3423.92] until later,
[3424.10 → 3424.82] but just wanted to mention
[3424.82 → 3425.76] that even with a VAC ban,
[3425.84 → 3426.86] you can still use your index.
[3427.18 → 3427.32] Hey,
[3427.36 → 3427.96] that is true.
[3428.14 → 3428.74] That is true.
[3428.82 → 3429.52] But you could also,
[3429.68 → 3430.56] depending on your Steam account,
[3430.64 → 3431.38] be out much more
[3431.38 → 3432.38] than the cost of an index.
[3433.14 → 3435.14] So Luke's and my point
[3435.14 → 3435.90] was just that
[3435.90 → 3437.28] random bans for no reason
[3437.28 → 3438.38] are bad,
[3438.46 → 3439.38] no matter who does it.
[3439.52 → 3439.72] Yes.
[3439.86 → 3440.88] That was what we were
[3440.88 → 3441.50] getting at there.
[3442.38 → 3442.64] Yeah.
[3444.08 → 3444.70] All right.
[3444.76 → 3446.04] I think that's pretty much it
[3446.04 → 3446.94] for the big news
[3446.94 → 3447.90] this week.
[3448.26 → 3449.12] Is there anything else
[3449.12 → 3450.22] you wanted to touch on, Luke?
[3450.22 → 3452.62] I don't think so.
[3452.74 → 3453.64] I wanted to bring up
[3453.64 → 3454.80] that folding phone thing
[3454.80 → 3455.32] just because I thought
[3455.32 → 3455.78] it was funny.
[3456.08 → 3457.14] I think people should go
[3457.14 → 3458.14] subscribe to Float plane
[3458.14 → 3459.00] so they get to see
[3459.00 → 3460.10] Secret Shopper on time.
[3460.58 → 3460.98] Yes.
[3461.62 → 3462.52] Secret Shopper
[3462.52 → 3464.14] is going to be early access
[3464.14 → 3465.66] on Floatplane.com
[3465.66 → 3467.24] and it is a boozy.
[3467.48 → 3468.62] It is a boozy
[3468.62 → 3469.54] this time around.
[3470.08 → 3470.76] Spoiler alert,
[3471.28 → 3472.18] it's a boozy.
[3473.88 → 3475.02] That's not really a spoiler,
[3475.22 → 3475.78] but it's definitely a boozy.
[3475.78 → 3476.46] I'm actually pretty excited.
[3476.72 → 3477.10] I really,
[3477.30 → 3478.26] really enjoyed the last one.
[3478.46 → 3479.84] I thought it was awesome.
[3481.52 → 3483.08] That was genuinely
[3483.08 → 3484.20] fantastic content
[3484.20 → 3485.20] and I've been wanting
[3485.20 → 3485.66] a follow-up
[3485.66 → 3486.54] because it's been long enough
[3486.54 → 3488.02] that very significant changes
[3488.02 → 3488.58] could have happened.
[3489.74 → 3490.40] Heck yeah.
[3491.08 → 3491.56] All right.
[3492.56 → 3493.18] I will...
[3493.98 → 3494.30] Oh yeah,
[3494.32 → 3494.80] I should go through
[3494.80 → 3496.16] a few Super Chats here.
[3496.74 → 3497.78] Cameron Ogle tree says,
[3497.84 → 3498.82] Linus fixed the lower third.
[3498.90 → 3499.10] Oh yeah,
[3499.12 → 3499.60] I fixed that.
[3499.92 → 3500.52] Eric says,
[3500.60 → 3502.10] check out Cedar Show Trees
[3502.10 → 3502.94] if you want to really extend
[3502.94 → 3504.04] the life of your shoes.
[3505.14 → 3506.92] Cedar Show Trees.
[3507.98 → 3509.10] Cedar Show Trees.
[3509.20 → 3511.12] What are you talking about?
[3512.50 → 3512.98] Cedar...
[3514.60 → 3515.98] Shoe Trees.
[3517.04 → 3517.92] Shoe Trees.
[3518.32 → 3519.34] Did I just read that wrong?
[3519.48 → 3519.68] No,
[3519.78 → 3520.64] you typed that wrong.
[3521.12 → 3522.82] Cedar Shoe Trees.
[3522.96 → 3523.54] Got it.
[3523.70 → 3524.06] Okay.
[3524.78 → 3525.10] Something,
[3525.26 → 3525.54] something.
[3526.74 → 3527.18] Yeah,
[3527.40 → 3527.74] I mean,
[3527.74 → 3528.28] for me...
[3528.28 → 3528.64] So you found your...
[3528.64 → 3530.20] Here's your competitive analysis,
[3530.46 → 3530.70] Linus.
[3530.70 → 3532.58] Yeah,
[3532.94 → 3534.14] I really don't need
[3534.14 → 3535.24] a Cedar Shoe Tree
[3535.24 → 3536.48] because the main...
[3536.48 → 3537.74] What wears out my shoes
[3537.74 → 3539.08] is that my feet
[3539.08 → 3540.52] like wear through
[3540.52 → 3542.34] the bottoms of them
[3542.34 → 3544.10] and the top layer
[3544.10 → 3545.48] like rips off
[3545.48 → 3546.34] just from the force
[3546.34 → 3547.76] of like...
[3547.76 → 3549.78] like lunging
[3549.78 → 3550.70] on the gym floor
[3550.70 → 3552.08] or like moving side to side.
[3552.64 → 3553.74] They just get torn apart.
[3553.74 → 3553.86] And lunges on your feet
[3553.86 → 3554.12] as well.
[3554.38 → 3554.66] Like,
[3554.74 → 3555.76] I know you mentioned this,
[3555.76 → 3557.06] but like the...
[3557.06 → 3558.32] It can screw your feet up
[3558.32 → 3560.22] like really fast.
[3560.70 → 3560.80] Yeah.
[3560.92 → 3561.66] And your shoes.
[3562.86 → 3563.22] Yeah.
[3563.40 → 3564.52] What else we got here?
[3565.74 → 3566.52] Did you know
[3566.52 → 3567.38] that the Gateway brand
[3567.38 → 3568.08] has come back?
[3568.14 → 3568.80] Says Nicol.
[3569.04 → 3569.64] Did you know
[3569.64 → 3570.44] that I don't care?
[3572.12 → 3572.74] I'm pretty sure
[3572.74 → 3573.40] we talked about that
[3573.40 → 3574.00] quite a while ago.
[3574.26 → 3574.32] Yeah.
[3574.44 → 3575.18] So brutal.
[3575.52 → 3575.84] Gateway.
[3576.56 → 3577.26] William says,
[3577.34 → 3577.72] yo Linus,
[3577.74 → 3578.62] we all saw the mouse pad
[3578.62 → 3579.32] samples you got.
[3579.50 → 3580.56] It's been a while now.
[3580.62 → 3581.42] What's going on with them?
[3581.50 → 3581.94] They're coming.
[3582.08 → 3582.60] We have placed
[3582.60 → 3583.26] our bulk order.
[3583.26 → 3585.24] They are 100% coming.
[3586.16 → 3586.30] Yeah.
[3586.56 → 3587.20] All I know is
[3587.20 → 3588.02] Nitwit got to market
[3588.02 → 3588.78] before you guys did.
[3588.78 → 3591.16] Yes.
[3591.72 → 3592.56] Kyle messaged me.
[3592.64 → 3592.82] He's like,
[3592.90 → 3593.04] hey,
[3593.32 → 3593.86] notice you guys
[3593.86 → 3594.70] don't have any mouse pads.
[3594.88 → 3595.46] Thought I'd send you
[3595.46 → 3596.20] a couple mouse pads.
[3596.34 → 3596.82] What's your address?
[3597.36 → 3597.68] Oh,
[3597.76 → 3599.22] go f*** yourself,
[3599.30 → 3599.48] Kyle.
[3601.26 → 3601.74] Sea hob says,
[3601.82 → 3602.38] can you say
[3602.38 → 3603.42] hey to my wife,
[3603.52 → 3603.70] Jen?
[3603.84 → 3604.02] Yes,
[3604.04 → 3604.38] I can.
[3607.38 → 3608.86] And that's pretty much it.
[3609.08 → 3609.86] Thank you guys
[3609.86 → 3610.80] very much for tuning
[3610.80 → 3611.54] into the WAN show.
[3611.62 → 3612.14] We will see you again
[3612.14 → 3612.56] next week.
[3612.68 → 3613.48] Same bad time,
[3613.90 → 3615.38] same bad channel.
[3615.38 → 3616.46] Bye.
[3617.06 → 3617.82] Apparently mouse pads
[3617.82 → 3619.04] are going on a ship tomorrow.
[3619.98 → 3620.36] There you go.
[3620.48 → 3621.04] That's from the one
[3621.04 → 3621.80] and only Nick Light.
[3624.54 → 3624.90] Oh,
[3625.06 → 3625.46] oh no.
[3625.74 → 3626.30] There we go.
[3626.30 → 3635.06] Holy crap.
[3635.54 → 3636.38] You were crazy.
[3636.92 → 3637.68] What did I do?
[3637.68 → 3638.22] What's the heck?
[3638.36 → 3639.10] You were still rolling,
[3639.16 → 3639.32] right?
[3639.56 → 3640.02] The bird.
[3640.50 → 3640.70] Oh,
[3640.80 → 3642.04] you're talking to me.
[3643.52 → 3643.80] Yeah,
[3643.80 → 3644.46] I was buying it.
[3644.52 → 3645.32] You were nuts.
[3645.68 → 3645.84] You know,
[3645.88 → 3647.12] this guy just decided
[3647.12 → 3648.16] he wanted live viewers.
[3648.16 → 3650.92] It's kind of nuts.
[3651.02 → 3652.46] It's like the least efficient way
[3652.46 → 3653.34] to get your tech news.
[3654.22 → 3654.66] Yeah.
[3655.14 → 3656.44] It literally airs
[3656.44 → 3657.38] at the same time
[3657.38 → 3658.68] as the most efficient way
[3658.68 → 3659.54] to get your tech news.
[3660.08 → 3660.86] I teach linked.
[3661.26 → 3662.80] I watched slash listen
[3662.80 → 3663.68] to the weirdest
[3663.68 → 3664.74] WAN show review recently.
[3664.88 → 3665.38] What?
[3665.74 → 3666.94] What do you want?
[3668.30 → 3669.56] Where the guy was talking
[3669.56 → 3671.02] about how he only watches
[3671.02 → 3672.88] WAN show for tech news.
[3673.62 → 3674.44] And it's one of the
[3674.62 → 3675.60] WAN show is one of the few
[3675.60 → 3676.42] things on YouTube
[3676.42 → 3678.28] that he is like,
[3678.36 → 3678.98] if it's there,
[3679.04 → 3680.44] he will definitely click on it.
[3680.50 → 3681.50] He will potentially like
[3681.50 → 3682.52] middle click it
[3682.52 → 3683.50] into a different window
[3683.50 → 3684.28] or,
[3684.28 → 3685.92] or click on it
[3685.92 → 3686.72] and watch it right away.
[3686.72 → 3687.42] Like it'll be
[3687.42 → 3688.48] one of the two
[3688.48 → 3689.78] guaranteed every time
[3689.78 → 3690.66] because he finds
[3690.66 → 3691.24] it's like the
[3691.24 → 3692.36] the best source
[3692.36 → 3693.22] of tech news.
[3693.46 → 3694.92] And like he gets everything
[3694.92 → 3696.30] and like we have good analysis
[3696.30 → 3697.08] and all this kind of stuff.
[3697.10 → 3697.42] And I was like,
[3697.60 → 3700.04] what are you talking about?
[3701.58 → 3702.56] We're off-topic
[3702.56 → 3703.94] like almost constantly.
[3704.28 → 3705.94] All of our news is old.
[3706.42 → 3707.42] Yeah.
[3710.10 → 3710.26] I mean,
[3710.26 → 3711.02] I appreciate it,
[3711.06 → 3711.94] but yeah.
[3714.10 → 3714.96] All right.
[3715.36 → 3715.62] Bye.
[3715.62 → 3716.04] Bye.
[3716.88 → 3717.44] Bye.
[3722.10 → 3725.24] And we are off YouTube
[3725.24 → 3726.76] and,
[3726.82 → 3734.46] you
[3734.46 → 3735.30] you
[3735.30 → 3736.00] you
[3736.00 → 3736.52] you
[3736.52 → 3740.26] you
[3740.26 → 3741.58] you
[3741.58 → 3742.90] you
[3742.98 → 3745.50] you
[3745.50 → 3746.42] you
[3746.42 → 3747.22] you
[3747.32 → 3747.90] you
