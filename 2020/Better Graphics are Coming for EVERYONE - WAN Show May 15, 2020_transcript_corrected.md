[0.00 → 9.12] welcome ladies and gentlemen to the wan show this is what it looks like when Luke and I try to start
[9.12 → 17.88] half an hour early yeah we start on time it's uh yeah it's that's quite the start we got
[17.88 → 24.72] there am I right yeah absolutely yep so I mean basically I just didn't want to be
[24.72 → 32.06] streaming until like 7 30 today because i was I streamed for six hours in a row yesterday
[32.06 → 37.48] uh rebuilding my machine so it's it started out as an innocent enough project I was gonna
[37.48 → 44.34] like i I had wanted to just do like a hey um you know you're bored you're stuck at home you know
[44.34 → 49.50] why not tear down and rebuild your computer for fun and profit right sure like that was kind of the
[49.50 → 54.68] intention and i I opened up with a story about how that was actually how I learned to build a computer
[54.68 → 61.12] was taking the machine that someone built for me and then tearing it down and putting it back
[61.12 → 65.64] together and making sure that it still ran that was like that was my first scratch build was one
[65.64 → 72.16] that I had just like hours before watched someone else build for me, and so i kind of wanted to talk
[72.16 → 77.02] about that and while I was at it, I wanted to fix some small problems that have been bothering me
[77.02 → 82.62] about my build for the last uh you know four and a half years ever since I finished it I broke my power
[82.62 → 86.86] button when I was installing my radiator I wanted to fix that my radiators it turns out weren't even
[86.86 → 91.92] mounted to anything they were just sitting there so because the screw holes hadn't lined up correctly
[91.92 → 96.76] on the case that we had manufactured because we sent them flawed plans so that we wanted to fix that
[96.76 → 102.08] my power supply didn't uh didn't mount properly so whenever you'd plug in a cable it would like push
[102.08 → 107.16] the power supply in and like wrench on the screws so I wanted to fix that and then I was like oh you
[107.16 → 111.42] know maybe I'll go hard line water cooling while I'm at it so I decided to do that six hours later I was
[111.42 → 117.86] still I was still streaming, but the good news is I am actually bringing this show to you right now
[117.86 → 124.74] from that machine it is working fine just fine and I even upgraded my memory today because people were
[124.74 → 136.20] shaming me oh i got system memory shamed yesterday because I had the know the
[136.20 → 147.78] audacity to run you know this plebeian corsair dominator memory that runs at a mere uh 2666 megahertz
[147.78 → 158.92] cl15 okay people were real unhappy about that because I am running a dozen um 3900x and well
[158.92 → 165.16] Linus um actually dozen really benefits a lot from faster memory I'm like I know, but it benefits
[165.16 → 170.92] it benefits a lot from faster memory in the same way that like you know your car benefits from
[170.92 → 179.10] going and getting it tuned at a shop it's like yes, yes it is does but for 99 of people that difference
[179.10 → 186.36] is not something that is noticeable and or meaningful so, and it will be fine it doesn't matter it doesn't
[186.36 → 193.58] matter, but it's out so it's out now it's gone it is very old memory served me very well this is gen 6
[193.58 → 199.68] so this was optimized for like the 6700k in terms of like the sub timing optimization stuff like that
[199.68 → 204.94] that XMP profile is basically worthless but I'm running some new g skill RGB stuff now it's all
[204.94 → 210.44] good, and you know what else is good the show that we've got for you guys today we've got uh we've
[210.44 → 218.54] actually got a lot of good news today NVIDIA's ampere a100 has been announced freaking exciting
[218.54 → 225.40] we're getting a whole new graphics card architecture also Unreal Engine 5 got demoed, and it looks
[225.40 → 231.30] absolutely jaw-dropping I took all the good stuff so why don't you go with the totally silly thing
[231.30 → 238.10] the totally silly thing you mean LG working on a new dual screen phone that swivels horizontally
[238.10 → 243.94] at least we have jaw-dropping I think we might have similar reactions yeah yeah I love it TSMC
[243.94 → 252.86] is potentially allegedly maybe planning to uh open a fab in the U.S. by 2023 yeah but who said this
[252.86 → 259.36] I don't I don't know okay well can we can talk we can talk more about that we can talk more about
[259.36 → 261.36] that later in the meantime let's roll that intro
[261.36 → 271.84] space raisin says exactly on time proof of pre-recording
[271.84 → 279.56] hi twitch why are you going on why are you going on YouTube sending a super chat to say hi to twitch
[279.56 → 284.46] that doesn't even make any sense no you want to say hi to twitch you just go on twitch say hi to twitch
[284.46 → 289.08] no one's stopping you from doing it all right why don't we jump right into our very first
[289.08 → 297.38] topic of the day this was post by Igor mp on the forum and in an announcement at etc that totally
[297.38 → 305.44] didn't rip off our kitchen set did you see that no I didn't jensen he ripped off our jam okay so
[305.44 → 311.98] he was in his kitchen working on computer stuff not wearing a leather jacket okay who else do you know
[311.98 → 316.66] who else do you know who hangs out in a kitchen doing computer stuff and who doesn't wear a leather
[316.66 → 324.36] jacket clearly, but he waits he is wearing a leather jacket is he wearing a leather jacket in that video
[324.36 → 334.08] he is not yeah no he is no he isn't uh Jensen cooking hold on cooking where is it
[334.08 → 340.86] no, no that's not leather that's not leather that's a puffy jacket what that's a puffy jacket
[340.86 → 346.68] I'm watching the same video he's 100 wearing a leather jacket I'm I'm bringing I'm bringing the
[346.68 → 352.12] people in I'm bringing the people in they're going to validate this for me 2020 keynote part one he's
[352.12 → 357.10] wearing a leather jacket window capture no, no I'm talking about I'm talking about before that okay I'm
[357.10 → 360.94] talking about this one where he's cooking up something in his kitchen or whatever see he's
[360.94 → 368.98] not wearing a leather jacket see there's a freaking fancy is that stove this is what I'm talking I know
[368.98 → 376.92] right what the heck nice kitchen hey bro look at that look at that gorgeous kitchen look at that
[376.92 → 385.82] gorgeous graphics card he's taken out of there it's beautiful I love it my um hello peasants let me get
[385.82 → 393.98] my wares yeah I know right anyway so he's so I'm just saying that I think that my case for him ripping
[393.98 → 404.16] off my likeness for profit is at least as strong as Lindsay Lohan's against rock star okay sure yeah I'm
[404.16 → 411.54] sold 100 I'm on board I would join this class action I don't know I don't know if you guys remember
[411.54 → 417.36] this, but this was a whole thing back in absolutely grand theft which Grand Theft Auto was
[417.36 → 422.16] that again five Grand Theft Auto five there you go, so this was a whole thing she was all like yep
[422.16 → 429.44] this is clearly this is clearly ripping off my likeness and uh she tried to sue them for I can't
[429.44 → 435.58] remember if it was just money or whatever anyway she lost and I would and I would lose two and that's
[435.58 → 440.66] okay because at least to make me feel better I've got some great news about new graphics cards
[440.66 → 449.96] so here we go uh ampere a100 is a sxm4 based add-in card destined for the data centre and
[449.96 → 454.48] supercomputers and this is probably a little disappointing to the gamers out there especially
[454.48 → 460.94] given the arguably misleading title on today's wan show, but we're actually referring to something else
[460.94 → 467.70] not this that's right there 's's more, and it's true um so disappointing to those folks is
[467.70 → 474.30] the fact that this is not a desktop based debut for ampere in the form of the RTX 3000 series that's
[474.30 → 480.82] what we're assuming it's going to be called, but it does give us at least some hints as to what we can
[480.82 → 487.00] expect from an ampere based GPU, so there are a few things that we can talk about with the a100 first it
[487.00 → 493.06] can efficiently scale to thousands of GPUs or be partitioned into seven GPU instances using
[493.06 → 501.68] multi-instance GPU or I love this MIG technology you want to use some MIG technology there Luke
[501.68 → 508.12] uh yeah dude NVIDIA is claiming a six times performance improvement out of the box in
[508.12 → 513.68] Burt deep learning training over previous generation Volta GPUs and up to 20 times higher performance in
[513.68 → 519.00] tensor float precision workloads with an additional 2x boost using mixed precision and 16-bit floating point
[519.00 → 526.44] and you know what even like two weeks ago I probably would have said g NVIDIA thanks for
[526.44 → 530.08] you know what let's let's say a month ago let's say a month ago I probably would have said g NVIDIA
[530.08 → 535.84] thanks for all the AI bull that you're putting into your consumer graphics cards that I honestly have
[535.84 → 543.94] no use for like where's my frames per second right but in the last three weeks alone I have seen
[543.94 → 549.58] let me just try and think I have seen three, or it's not three weeks whatever the last month or
[549.58 → 556.92] so I have seen three very compelling uses for their AI on the desktop first DSS 2.0 is way better
[556.92 → 564.94] than DSS gen 1 it actually doesn't suck now like you can run a game at a lower resolution, and it will
[564.94 → 571.78] fake upscale itself in a way that is shockingly convincing number one right there number two I watched
[571.78 → 578.72] them use their deep learning upsampling on the shield to make 1080p content look not quite native 4k
[578.72 → 586.80] but boy is it close to the point where you know if it was I don't know it's like this weird fine line
[586.80 → 593.10] because there's the people who would not notice the difference between 1080 and 4k anyway and
[593.10 → 598.16] then there's the people who would notice the difference between 4k and this upscaled stuff and I would say
[598.16 → 604.22] that NVIDIA's upsampling is going to appeal to kind of 80 of the people who could tell the difference
[604.22 → 609.96] but aren't like that sensitive if that kind of makes sense do you catch my drift so you're it's not going
[609.96 → 613.54] to make any difference for the people who just couldn't tell it all anyway but for everyone who
[613.54 → 617.32] could tell I think you could take most of that chunk and say yeah they're gonna they're going to be
[617.32 → 624.56] convinced by their AI upscaling and then the big one is of course RTX voice now RTX voice absolutely
[624.56 → 631.40] diarrhea'd all over itself for my stream yesterday but I'm not going to blame RTX voice for that because
[631.40 → 636.16] I think it might have actually been to do with the fact that I was running my RTX GPU in a thunderbolt
[636.16 → 640.84] enclosure that also had USB ports on it that I also had additional capture devices running through
[640.84 → 646.58] because blah blah blah long story I didn't have enough thunderbolt ports and I had too many captures
[646.58 → 652.46] devices for the stream um so you know that was a problem but RTX voice the way that it blocks out
[652.46 → 659.58] background noise absolutely freaking fantastic and i am legitimately excited to see what kind of
[659.58 → 666.66] AI tricks NVIDIA can pull out of their butts and uh work into my desktop experience
[666.66 → 674.02] uh what else is going on here uh additional 2x boost using mixed precision and 16-bit floating point
[674.02 → 678.60] blah blah blah NVIDIA also claims that for other high performance compute applications new double
[678.60 → 684.26] precision tensor cores enable a reduction of a 10-hour simulation on Volta to four hours on ampere
[684.26 → 689.88] and compared to Volta ampere has 35 percent more CUBA cores now that is going to translate directly to
[689.88 → 694.82] gamers 78 higher memory bandwidth that's going to be good for gamers double the link links
[694.82 → 701.94] probably less applicable for gamers SLI is dead and is on the 7 nanometre TSMC node so we should
[701.94 → 709.18] expect potentially higher clock speeds and a better efficiency um let's see if there's just anything
[709.18 → 714.10] else that you guys will actually kind of care about here the expansion of tensor core capabilities
[714.10 → 718.64] blah blah blah better deep learning capabilities oh yeah okay so Anthony threw in some commentary
[718.64 → 724.24] about how yes this better AI could mean more technologies like deep learning super sampling but i
[724.24 → 731.04] already I already talked about that which is cool so Luke place your bet how long is it going to be
[731.04 → 736.96] before we get a desktop ampere graphics card, and you're ready to upgrade to touring because
[736.96 → 744.48] everybody's offloading their tourings holiday you think holiday this year i you know i
[744.48 → 749.92] I was really i I don't know wow you have so much confidence because i I was kind of all over the place
[749.92 → 756.28] on this one I was thinking either like a month from now because NVIDIA has done that before like gone
[756.28 → 762.48] new gpu new gpu new gpu like all the way down the family kind of four to six weeks apart
[762.48 → 769.14] they've they've pulled that move um but then I was also kind of thinking well they don't have a
[769.14 → 776.68] competitor at all right now like they could just wait till next year for all they care realistically
[776.68 → 783.68] so you say holiday do you care to name it care to name a month I want to hear it what month
[783.68 → 792.90] November you say November okay so are they going to try to hit why would you try to hit holiday
[792.90 → 797.18] why what's your motivation you're Jensen you're Jensen Huang you're wearing a leather jacket
[797.18 → 803.10] okay, okay okay go you know put yourself in character yeah incredibly beautiful stonework
[803.10 → 810.46] around my incredible stove behind me yeah glowing in the sunlight uh and I'm telling my team that i
[810.46 → 819.70] think we should wait for holiday because uh no competition right now and uh the covid grab to buy
[819.70 → 825.90] pc parts I haven't looked into it but I'm assuming it's starting to slow down a bit um, and now we might
[825.90 → 832.80] be settling into a lower fund across the board yeah state for covid, so people like the purchasing
[832.80 → 836.86] of these parts might be going down I'm not sure these are assumptions that I'm making
[836.86 → 842.20] right now sure he would know though just for painting the scene sure yeah yeah he's your in the
[842.20 → 846.96] character you got to get in character yeah yeah yeah um and then i would aim for this holiday
[846.96 → 854.18] not for next year because uh I mean you might as well yeah you can kind of line up with the
[854.18 → 859.84] early enough purchases for people that are going to be buying relatively early for potential Christmas
[859.84 → 864.28] stuff um and I think people are a little bit looser with their wallets around that time anyway can I
[864.28 → 870.04] give my guess for why i now that you've said holiday i 100 agree with you that that's what they're they're
[870.04 → 879.24] going to do okay i think he wants to crap on the upcoming console launches because he's already
[879.24 → 885.22] talked some smack we've heard Jensen talk smack about how like yeah that performance tier has
[885.22 → 892.84] existed for a while it's called a RTX 2080 lol um yeah i I think there's some more smack talk we're
[892.84 → 897.24] going to talk about later on in this show but yeah honestly that's a big one too yeah i would
[897.24 → 901.74] definitely I'm on board with that I think he's the kind of character you know he's got it remember he's
[901.74 → 906.60] got his leather jacket okay I think he's the kind of character that would want to get on stage and say
[906.60 → 912.84] hey cool cute console that's nice good job um you know if you want something twice as powerful
[912.84 → 919.58] team green you know sucks he would absolutely love to do that yeah yeah I'm sure he'd be into that
[919.58 → 926.08] that's some strong logic I like it, I do have a quick super chat that I need to read um the real smiley
[926.08 → 932.44] says don't waste your money on a super chat it will not be acknowledged even a 50 one I did it to test
[932.44 → 937.18] to see on his last live stream first time I've ever paid money to comment lol how dumb of me you're
[937.18 → 942.70] welcome so yeah I didn't see your super chat but I did see that so now there you go there's your
[942.70 → 947.94] shout out smart guy how you feel now all right lets uh let's move on to our next topic here
[947.94 → 956.44] um Unreal Engine 5 demoed want to give us the run through here this is super exciting
[956.44 → 964.32] it's its kind of long actually there 's's a bunch of stuff going on i I suggest you watch
[964.32 → 969.26] the video I will say uh engine videos unless you're watching them with somewhat of a trained eye
[969.26 → 976.08] uh might not mean a ton, but it looks really nice so might as well check it out uh it's its epic
[976.08 → 983.18] games released this footage, and it is specifically from it is an Unreal Engine 5 running on a PlayStation
[983.18 → 989.08] 5 console that's the like important flex that's going on here and this is very cool I say this
[989.08 → 994.84] every time I'm going to say it again this is very cool for console players as well because or sorry
[994.84 → 1000.12] for pc players as well because the further consoles push things will look better on pc yeah even when
[1000.12 → 1004.92] like every time a new console comes out they get really close or surpass the price point
[1004.92 → 1010.24] value that pcs are going to be at that time but then over time pcs supersede by a huge amount
[1010.24 → 1016.46] 100 and games are just going to look better in general, so this is fantastic uh I'm going to read
[1016.46 → 1021.88] directly from notes here for a second visualized micro polygon geometry oh we've had a lot of fun
[1021.88 → 1027.68] word combinations in this land show so far uh which allows developers to use film quality meshes as
[1027.68 → 1033.10] sources, and you can see in the demo things do look very, very good uh which with each comprising
[1033.10 → 1039.90] hundreds of millions of polygons um they talk about nanite scales lots of ability to put
[1039.90 → 1044.50] huge amounts of polygons and tons of varied objects across the screen at the same time
[1044.50 → 1051.32] uh developers no longer need to bake details to normal maps in order to maximize detail um
[1051.32 → 1056.74] this better overall global illumination they give some examples of that in the video as well
[1056.74 → 1061.88] it allows fully dynamic multi-balanced lighting that immediately reacts to scene and light changes
[1061.88 → 1065.28] that lighting looks incredible can I just I'm going to let you finish but like
[1065.28 → 1071.66] wow it looks perfect you want to demo it you can, I've got it up right now okay yeah they're
[1071.66 → 1077.50] they're watching they're watching huzzah um the lighting is the lighting demo is really cool uh it
[1077.50 → 1082.40] can benefit from developers trying to improve their games as well as uh to make the final title more
[1082.40 → 1086.90] reactive to player inputs which is great allows developers to iterate in real time without having
[1086.90 → 1092.60] to wait for light map bakes to finish saving huge amounts of time it probably does uh this new
[1092.60 → 1097.00] technology is not a next gen exclusive and will scale to work on a variety of both old and new
[1097.00 → 1103.62] platforms also cool especially with the uh the new Xbox thing that makes it so that you can buy a game
[1103.62 → 1108.24] and it's available on a variety of platforms so if you're sticking with your current console for a
[1108.24 → 1113.08] little while, and you buy these new games when you move to your next con like it should the new games
[1113.08 → 1116.04] should look better on your current console and when you move to the next console you'll be able to
[1116.04 → 1121.84] keep your games it's nice little combination uh but the spiciness i kind of plowed through a lot of that
[1121.84 → 1127.52] to the spiciness this is the fun part to discuss on the LAN show um they are claiming the
[1127.52 → 1134.48] new SSDs on the next gen consoles will allow huge complex large-scale worlds that will be streamed
[1134.48 → 1139.48] into the machine in incredible detail without you really noticing things popping in the traditional
[1139.48 → 1145.52] way that you would yeah and Sweeney said the storage architecture on PlayStation 4 in PlayStation 5
[1145.52 → 1151.20] is far ahead of anything you can buy on any pc for any amount of money right now
[1151.20 → 1158.02] really great to see that sort of innovation that's going to help drive future pcs they're going to and
[1158.02 → 1164.04] then this part i I was trying to cross-reference this quote and I haven't watched this part of the
[1164.04 → 1171.18] video yet um, but it says they're going to see this thing ship and realize oh wow m2 SSDs I need to
[1171.18 → 1178.94] catch up with it, we have m2 SSD again I haven't watched that part of the video and I need to
[1178.94 → 1184.06] need to find that exact comment and I've been trying to reference more comments about this
[1184.06 → 1192.62] on the future uh on the internet since then but yeah the PS5 uses a PCIE 4.0 SSD that reaches speeds
[1192.62 → 1200.86] of 5.5 gigabytes per second I'm back what'd you get sorry I was gone I was gone I was gone I was uh
[1201.50 → 1206.78] oh hold on first first i just I want to pull up the demo again for a second here
[1206.78 → 1214.62] because this is just so mind-blowing okay so you can see with the global illumination so cool to be
[1214.62 → 1222.38] clear global illumination is not the same thing as uh ray tracing necessarily so you can have light
[1222.38 → 1230.14] bounce without necessarily being photon by photon but this is so cool they show this is the light
[1230.14 → 1238.62] source and then basically everything else is lit by that light source which is that hard light from
[1238.62 → 1243.58] the sun bouncing that's how it works in the real world I remember talking to Brandon about this for
[1243.58 → 1249.58] a while um or a while back when we were building our uh our set at the office that's kind of set up like a
[1249.58 → 1256.14] like a condo and I was like Brandon why can't we just have like a handful of lights set up and then
[1256.14 → 1262.70] you know kind of like if I was just in my house um you could just kind of have those be the kind
[1262.70 → 1267.02] of the base lighting, and then we can just add as needed, but it's like kind of ready to go at any time
[1267.02 → 1272.78] he's like well the issue is that because we have no way of routing you know the power of the sun
[1272.78 → 1278.14] into our studio unless you want to buy like you know 2 000 watt lights and point them through the
[1278.14 → 1283.82] windows so that they actually like bounce off the floor and walls and globally illuminate the
[1283.82 → 1287.18] place you're just not going to get it, and you're going to end up with all kinds of other issues that
[1287.18 → 1290.86] I didn't care as much about like oh you're gonna you know the colour of your floor is going to colour
[1290.86 → 1295.02] the light and blah blah blah I was like yeah I mean we're just looking for sort of like a baseline here
[1295.02 → 1300.22] but anyway that's how real lighting works and that's why it looks so natural and that's why it's so much
[1300.22 → 1304.22] work to recreate that effect with studio lighting because you have to have this understanding of
[1304.22 → 1308.46] light and the way it bounces and the way that it interacts with things that um you know I had never
[1308.46 → 1314.14] i just never really thought about um from a film perspective anyway you know a number of years ago
[1314.14 → 1321.50] when we were first talking about this and so seeing it done this way dynamically um
[1323.10 → 1327.50] in a demo that is actually running on what will be production hardware that you can buy for
[1327.50 → 1337.42] presumably console pricing in a couple of you know quarters here is just mind-bending um with that
[1337.42 → 1343.98] said you know why do you know why does someone like Tim Sweeney like how many billions of dollars is
[1343.98 → 1351.02] he is worth like what why does he need to why does he need to say stuff that's just like demonstrably false
[1351.02 → 1360.86] you know like how fast is that how fast is the storage of the PS5 5.5 gigabytes per second 5.5 gigabytes per second
[1360.86 → 1366.62] all right, so there's a little um there's a little uh video platform you might have heard of if it's called float plane
[1366.62 → 1371.98] um yeah there's a there's a team working on that over there good good people you know
[1371.98 → 1378.86] it's a little slow, but they're good people they're nice people you know um so over on that platform there's this creator
[1378.86 → 1383.82] he didn't have a beard before he's got a beard now the community is kind of divided on whether he should keep it
[1384.46 → 1390.06] decent, decent enough guy though um he uploaded a video really clickbaity title I can't stand that
[1390.06 → 1396.38] about this guy it's very frustrating and uh the video is called this is 50 times faster than your pc
[1396.38 → 1403.98] holy um and he's got this SSD that according to Tim Sweeney doesn't exist for any amount of money
[1404.86 → 1409.58] and it's just it's crazy because there he is hold on a second here i can
[1409.58 → 1414.14] screen share with you guys look at this guy look at this beard look at this stupid face he makes
[1414.14 → 1419.82] in his thumbnail it's awful you've got that question mark in there so here's this guy right and he's
[1419.82 → 1430.30] holding it just like that that's a thing that Tim Sweeney said is not real um but like it's its so
[1430.30 → 1434.70] funny because there it is look it's in his hand actually no, no no that's a different one that's
[1434.70 → 1438.86] a slower one look he threw that one away and that one's also faster than the one Tim Sweeney said
[1438.86 → 1445.34] doesn't exist isn't that weird like why do they do this you know you've already you've already got
[1445.34 → 1450.06] enough money to buy the earth and all the heavens why do you need to sell out to Sony to just say stuff
[1450.06 → 1456.54] that's just not true at all um also you know that guy I happen to actually know him pretty well
[1456.54 → 1466.62] um he dropped off in my house this a little while ago this is a SSD that is not only uh as
[1466.62 → 1476.70] fast as the PlayStation 5's SSD but is actually at 1500 megabytes oh excuse me 15 000 megabytes a second
[1477.26 → 1485.02] double the speed and yet here it is so that guy's got one okay actually he's got two I've got one right
[1485.02 → 1493.34] here's another one so that is three now that is three pc SSDs that are faster for any amount of
[1493.34 → 1498.94] money I didn't say they were cheap faster than the PlayStation 5 storage system look at that what a
[1498.94 → 1506.06] fine what a funny thing would you look at that isn't that funny how that works they're saying 5.5
[1506.06 → 1511.82] gigabytes per second read and typical eight to nine gigabytes per second compressed
[1511.82 → 1521.42] okay still slower just reiterating anyway to be very clear uh was there anything else that you
[1521.42 → 1526.22] wanted to talk about with the unreal 5 demo because I wanted to talk about the PlayStation 5 storage
[1526.22 → 1530.14] for sure some people in the chat say I know I blew through some of the earlier stuff I just wanted to
[1530.14 → 1536.86] get to the controversial statement yeah uh someone said global illumination has existed in the past yes
[1536.86 → 1543.02] it absolutely has it's a new globalization global illumination solution yes
[1543.66 → 1548.22] I remember I mean global illumination has been something that the gaming industry has been trying
[1548.22 → 1554.86] to conquer since well basically the gaming industry existed um you know NVIDIA thought their voxel based
[1554.86 → 1560.38] global illumination was going to take off back with maxwell uh to my knowledge that never really gained a
[1560.38 → 1568.30] ton of traction uh although I don't actually know how Unreal Engine 5 is doing it so um yeah I will I
[1568.30 → 1573.34] would I would definitely need to get into some deeper dives into what exactly their implementation looks
[1573.34 → 1580.46] like but with uh with their voxel based global illumination if I recall correctly NVIDIA was taking
[1580.46 → 1586.46] more complex objects and they were kind of having them bounce as though they were much simpler ones they
[1586.46 → 1594.62] like these volumetric pixels um so yes not, not new like ray tracing is new ray tracing is different but
[1594.62 → 1599.50] global illumination is not new it's just that that particular technique for it running in real time at
[1599.50 → 1610.30] that level of detail with 8k textures on a PlayStation right that's crazy cool now I spent a fair bit of time
[1610.30 → 1617.74] mocking Tim Sweeney's statement that the storage architecture in PlayStation 5 is far ahead of
[1617.74 → 1623.50] anything you can get in a pc for any amount of money but that doesn't change that what he's saying does
[1623.50 → 1630.86] is um there's a kernel of truth in the misleading statement and the kernel of truth is that um compared to
[1631.50 → 1642.94] any pc that you would buy like off the shelf yes it is faster and compared to any mainstream pc it is
[1642.94 → 1649.50] much faster and will be coming in at a price that is going to uh and at a volume that is going to
[1649.50 → 1657.18] change the way that game developers utilize storage that's what he's trying to say even if he ended up
[1657.18 → 1665.02] making a really stupid statement in order to say it two thousand dollar really fancy packed uh SSDs are
[1665.02 → 1671.58] not necessarily what most people are considering when they're building computers and technically uh we
[1671.58 → 1680.06] haven't been able to like fully see in action as far as I know the the the real capabilities
[1680.06 → 1686.30] because he's talking about the architecture of the whole thing uh so like interconnects between the
[1686.30 → 1690.86] ram and then and the more long-term storage and everything else but you're getting a little
[1690.86 → 1696.62] nuanced at that point and we don't have enough data to pick out there as far as I know I'm sorry
[1696.62 → 1703.02] did you say two thousand dollars because uh this is more than that how much is that one uh I can't find
[1703.02 → 1708.06] an U.S. price for it, I'm not sure if it's strictly speaking available but I found an U.S. listing for it
[1708.06 → 1712.38] that was over three thousand Australian dollars I don't know exactly what the conversion is there though
[1712.38 → 1720.22] um anyway the point is you know what he's trying to say I think is that by having so much
[1720.22 → 1726.46] faster storage on hand and knowing that they can count on having fast storage available on hand and
[1726.46 → 1732.30] remember none of this would be worth anything if Microsoft wasn't also putting very fast storage in
[1732.30 → 1738.70] the upcoming Xbox even if it's not quite as fast I mean it's all kind of measuring contest at that
[1738.70 → 1744.62] point anyway um because game developers especially considering that they're both running the same CPU
[1744.62 → 1751.10] and GPU are not going to be you know foundationally designing their games differently if the PlayStation
[1751.10 → 1758.06] and the Xbox don't both have the ability to take advantage of it and the pc too now that pc storage is
[1758.06 → 1762.86] and has been quite a lot faster than consoles which have been stuck with hard drives for the longest time
[1762.86 → 1769.42] so um so this reliance on having this base functionality is going to change the way that they
[1769.42 → 1775.66] can handle things like as Luke was mentioning earlier uh textures instead of having that pop in
[1775.66 → 1782.86] being able to load let's say for example many more different versions of an asset so that you can
[1782.86 → 1787.66] swap them out extremely quickly as you are moving towards them so that it's much less jarring you know
[1787.66 → 1792.78] that's just one very rudimentary example of how you could do something like that if you know you can count
[1792.78 → 1796.78] on very high speed storage another really cool thing that you could do if you can count on high
[1796.78 → 1804.06] speed storage not to mention a faster CPU is you could actually start to design games with much
[1804.06 → 1809.34] faster load times because that's something that you're going to run into these days is you can have
[1809.34 → 1814.46] I like I could put this I could put this in my computer and most of the games that I run would
[1814.46 → 1817.26] still have abominable load times you want to know why
[1817.26 → 1827.58] yes, yes oh thank you Luke thank you Luke it's because it's primarily no it's primarily CPU bottlenecked
[1828.70 → 1834.38] I'm decompressing the game assets as you're firing up a game is primarily CPU bottlenecked because
[1835.02 → 1841.34] it's been all about compressing that data down as much as possible to deliver it over a network for
[1841.34 → 1847.98] example or to squeeze it onto a console hard drive, so people can install as many games as they
[1847.98 → 1853.74] can on their you know 500 gigs or one terabyte drives or whatever the case may be and there has been no
[1853.74 → 1861.66] compelling reason to say okay um well you know what we should do then is we should uh we should uh unpack
[1861.66 → 1866.62] more of these assets, and then we should just stream them uncompressed while the player is playing because
[1866.62 → 1871.02] there was no option to do that because the hard drive wasn't fast enough so you had these you had
[1871.02 → 1875.50] these two bottlenecks that were present you had a CPU bottleneck anytime you needed to unpack something
[1875.50 → 1879.74] and then you had a storage bottleneck if you decided okay you know what to heck with it, I'm going to
[1879.74 → 1883.50] unpack it early and I'm just going to stream all the assets in well you couldn't do it anyway because
[1883.50 → 1888.94] a modern two and a half inch hard drive is still limited to 150 to 200 megabytes a second-best case
[1888.94 → 1895.98] scenario, so this is going to change the way that they can load assets into games and I don't think
[1895.98 → 1901.10] that crediting Sony with changing the gaming industry here makes a ton of sense and his
[1901.10 → 1906.22] statement that there is no SSD for any amount of money that's as fast as this is really stupid
[1906.22 → 1913.66] because this is just this is literally wired to the CPU that's what it is wired directly to
[1913.66 → 1919.74] the PCI Express bus on the CPU and if you imagine for a second that Sony's CPU and the PlayStation is
[1919.74 → 1927.82] not just an AMD chip running PCI Express then you're a fool um that's all there is to it, I'm going to be
[1927.82 → 1934.38] I'm going to be that guy does it one do it a little bit to do it now I was probably wrong in the pre-show
[1934.38 → 1943.10] when I said i was loud but um apparently he doesn't technically say it's faster
[1943.10 → 1950.94] far ahead okay um what does far ahead mean I don't know so if I were to say if I okay look
[1950.94 → 1955.82] look let's just think for a second if I were to say usain bolt is far ahead of the other
[1955.82 → 1963.98] competitors on the track what does that mean okay yeah if I were to say if I were to say um you know
[1963.98 → 1969.74] for example that i I don't know any people who drive cars for a living so I'm going to go with Danica Patrick
[1969.74 → 1975.50] that's the only one I'm familiar with okay if I were to say that she was far ahead of the competition
[1975.50 → 1983.98] what would that what would that mean far ahead in endorsements far I mean he's probably far ahead
[1983.98 → 1989.90] in endorsements right now yeah I think he's doing all right but yeah I don't know it's its it's we'll
[1989.90 → 1996.54] we'll have to see what it actually translates into I don't suspect much uh I don't suspect anyone's going to
[1996.54 → 2004.38] to load up a pc and go oh or a PS5 and go like oh wow how am I going to catch up with this I don't
[2004.38 → 2010.46] think that's going to happen yeah me neither but I mean hopefully it's there hopefully they make
[2010.46 → 2017.74] leaps and stripes leaks leaps and strides in terms of architecture and then if they do anything uh that
[2017.74 → 2023.42] that's like really transformative with their memory architecture hopefully it comes to pc yeah I mean it
[2023.42 → 2027.98] may not be possible I mean there is an advantage to running your own operating system i
[2027.98 → 2034.86] mean we showed uh we showed when we fired up our new one x storage server that just because you're
[2034.86 → 2040.06] running the same SSDs wired into the same PCI Express bus doesn't mean that you get the same error-free
[2040.06 → 2047.02] operation um from one operating system to another one so it is possible that Sony will be looking at a
[2047.02 → 2052.86] significant performance advantage with their implementation based on the software side of
[2052.86 → 2058.54] things but I guess what I'm what I was mostly trying to say in my tongue-in-cheek way is that
[2059.34 → 2064.30] if they're 30 ahead that's not going to result in a 30 difference in how these games are going to run
[2064.30 → 2070.38] on the PlayStation um foundationally everything is going solid state which is going to be a huge
[2070.38 → 2073.90] advantage but past that we're going to be looking at a point of diminishing returns
[2073.90 → 2082.54] they they they talked about um how they worked to remove any bottlenecks that current SSDs have
[2082.54 → 2086.78] and like all this other kind of stuff and that that's fantastic and I hope it works for them but
[2086.78 → 2097.26] um yeah i I think I'm on I'm on Linus's side with the overall I don't know about the like oh wow
[2097.26 → 2102.54] how am I going to catch up on pc there's no way I could buy anything that's this good meanwhile Microsoft
[2102.54 → 2105.18] doesn't even consider them a competitor any more sick burn
[2108.38 → 2113.50] well what do you what do you think i way, way ahead of everything yeah with minimal information
[2114.46 → 2120.46] Xbox One X or PS5 um like who do you think is going to win the war this time I think it's relatively
[2120.46 → 2126.14] obvious that PlayStation won last time I think Sony goes in with the momentum on their side uh you know
[2126.14 → 2134.38] because I mean yeah yeah we can talk about the SSD and the PlayStation 5 or the graphics card
[2134.38 → 2142.78] in the Xbox One series x all day but at the end of it all what makes someone choose one console
[2142.78 → 2148.62] versus another one okay I'm gonna I'm going to put down three things and I'm going to see if you say the same
[2148.62 → 2154.54] three things okay hold on hold on you can see it how can you see it I covered it because I'm
[2154.54 → 2159.26] on the same dock as you oh okay don't look at it don't look at it covered it with my hand
[2159.26 → 2164.86] okay well don't look at it okay uh I was like wow am I screen sharing right now because I'm looking at
[2164.86 → 2169.82] the obs window I'm not screen sharing right now are you magic are you magic okay so you probably saw
[2169.82 → 2174.62] the first one, but you were going to say that anyway so go ahead hit me what are your three items
[2174.62 → 2181.18] that determine which console you buy I said games exclusives I'm kind of bundling those as one thing
[2181.18 → 2191.42] yeah uh bundles slash price which I'm also bundling is kind of one thing and then friends okay so I had
[2191.42 → 2197.18] exclusives whatever your friend group buys so we were overlapping on two of them and then I actually had
[2197.18 → 2204.06] controller as a major determinant of which console you would prefer because there are so many games that are
[2204.06 → 2209.42] cross-platform now that I could see people choosing one or the other assuming pricing and bundles are
[2209.42 → 2214.54] similar based on well you know I really prefer the Xbox or I really prefer the PlayStation controller
[2214.54 → 2222.70] bundles and price that's another big one so nowhere in any of that was uh who has the fastest you know
[2223.58 → 2229.90] SSD right yeah that it's not in there because that's not why people buy by game consoles at the end of
[2229.90 → 2238.86] the day so I think that to me exclusives is going to be the thing that puts the momentum in on Sony's
[2238.86 → 2247.34] side because if I played you know the the the last um oh man I haven't owned a PlayStation since the
[2247.34 → 2253.26] PlayStation 2 okay sure I played some uncharted game or whatever and I'm I'm invested in this series
[2253.26 → 2260.06] now you know I'm a PlayStation user um I think there's a strong chance I buy the new one yeah
[2260.06 → 2265.82] that makes sense and I would agree with that i someone in chat said uh the controllers are all
[2265.82 → 2271.82] good now it's not really the point yeah I think the controllers have been all good for quite a while
[2271.82 → 2278.86] yeah um i the controller thing for me at least it's its all about the thumb stick positioning
[2278.86 → 2282.62] and there's a huge difference between the two, and it doesn't matter that the PlayStation controller is
[2282.62 → 2288.70] good for me, it's its the positioning of the thumb sticks throws off the usability of the
[2288.70 → 2293.02] controller by a massive amount for me personally because I'm so used to those offset thumb stick
[2293.02 → 2298.70] positions and so that's actually a pretty big deal it's not a fanboyism thing, but it is a muscle
[2298.70 → 2303.98] memory thing that makes a big difference as a gamer like you know if you're used to a keyboard and
[2303.98 → 2310.06] mouse or if you're used to uh inverted look for example if someone changes your control scheme
[2310.06 → 2315.26] and you are anything, but you know a very entry-level gamer it's going to muck you up and so if you're
[2315.26 → 2320.94] used to the symmetrical thumb sticks you there's a there is a chance that that could be a determining
[2320.94 → 2324.62] factor for you to just say okay well all other things being equal I'm just I'm just gonna PlayStation 5
[2325.42 → 2332.38] i I got my Xbox controller to work on uh the PlayStation 4 when I was using the PlayStation 4
[2332.38 → 2339.18] because of course you did so nuts yeah okay but like the average user isn't going to do that
[2339.18 → 2345.66] it was actually a pretty fun project, and it works very well but um yeah it's not going to be a normal
[2345.66 → 2353.26] thing you know what is going to be a normal thing sponsor talking about our sponsors' oh yeah
[2353.90 → 2358.06] I do want to talk about some more console stuff after though because my kids have been playing with
[2358.06 → 2363.02] my old game gear so don't let me forget all right the show today is brought to you by
[2363.98 → 2370.38] mans caped hey Luke do you need some uh do you need to do some manscaping over there I noticed your bangs

[2492.62 → 2496.94] different styles here's a bunch of like Star Wars stuff if for whatever reason you're still
[2496.94 → 2503.66] into that dead show um what else we got to say about display uh they've got an easy magnetic mounting
[2503.66 → 2507.34] system there are no holes in the wall, and it's replaceable they plant a tree for every display
[2507.34 → 2513.18] purchased and for may only they're offering official Star Wars prints for up to 40 off using code empire
[2513.18 → 2519.10] 40. Just click the link below and check those out just show everybody you know how tasteless you are
[2519.10 → 2524.14] um my the majority I'll talk about this after sorry all right I'm done you know what in all
[2524.14 → 2528.30] seriousness though display has something for absolutely everyone if you like Star Wars I'm not
[2528.30 → 2535.74] going to shame you yet okay now sponsor spots over now I'm going to shame you okay so did you
[2535.74 → 2541.82] don't even have anything for the new Star Wars stuff well why would they's all old Star Wars well
[2541.82 → 2550.22] that makes sense doesn't it one okay so did you see did you see that twitter exchange
[2551.50 → 2560.46] Star Wars story heads response to canon complaints did you see did you not see this no holy crap this
[2560.46 → 2567.98] is freaking awesome so uh one of the one of the story heads uh so Lucasfilm story group creative
[2567.98 → 2576.30] executive Matt martin told this is on Twitter told fans to chill when it comes to canon because
[2576.30 → 2582.46] the way he sees it you can just kind of like have your own head canon you know you can include
[2582.46 → 2589.66] whatever you want or don't want to because it's all fake anyway which pretty much your face is so
[2589.66 → 2595.10] perfect right now I love it which pretty much amounts to like you guys are a bunch of nerds why do
[2595.10 → 2603.90] you even care so much about this talk about completely having no concept no understanding
[2603.90 → 2610.94] whatsoever of your customer and your fan base and then opening your mouth and demonstrating it for the
[2610.94 → 2620.78] entire world to see he basically said yeah at this point we understand that none of it makes any sense
[2620.78 → 2628.14] and we've given up and so should you because who cares anyway it's all fake of course it's fake it's
[2628.14 → 2637.42] a story that doesn't mean that there isn't a value to trying to tell a cohesive one who cares Dave felony
[2637.42 → 2655.58] just, just brutal just absolutely brutal, and it's like i you know what I get it as someone if I were
[2655.58 → 2662.06] to come in onto that team right um actually no I was about to say if I were to if I were to join that team
[2662.06 → 2667.50] i I might be I might just kind of go yeah you know what forget it I give up this none of this makes
[2667.50 → 2673.66] any sense so we're just going to have to just treat Star Wars like you know what it has become just kind
[2673.66 → 2680.62] of making it up as we go and plot holes and inconsistencies be damned because the ship completely
[2680.62 → 2686.06] sailed you know it sailed a long time ago I don't think I could do it though who wouldn't give up
[2686.06 → 2700.94] they follow okay fine um i just don't think it would be um yeah i i I don't think I could do it
[2700.94 → 2708.62] like if i is okay so you know total miracle you know someone a decision maker at Disney
[2708.62 → 2712.38] is watching this right now, and they're like hey this guy seems to have his act together let's put
[2712.38 → 2720.14] Linus in charge okay they bring me in tomorrow I would probably scrap like oh man i I would do some
[2720.14 → 2727.50] I would do some controversial stuff man so an I would scrap the entire sequel trilogy because um i
[2727.50 → 2731.90] actually very controversial I actually came up with well yes and no there's like there's salvageable
[2731.90 → 2736.14] stuff in there but I came up with this idea like right out of the gate right out of the gate the
[2736.14 → 2744.14] sequel trilogy makes no sense whatsoever because the notoriously racist empire has Finn as a soldier
[2744.14 → 2749.66] which is like why so there was plenty of room for because I know a lot of people are really upset
[2749.66 → 2754.14] about the sequels because it felt like Disney was trying to hit a diversity quota I actually don't
[2754.14 → 2761.02] mind that at all there is nothing wrong with that this is obviously a gigantic galaxy full of you know
[2761.02 → 2768.70] everything from you know baby Yoda to humans to surfaces to whatever like it that diversity
[2768.70 → 2776.70] is actually like core to Star Wars to me like if Luke and Obi-Wan wandered into that cantina okay
[2776.70 → 2782.54] and it was full of like you know a bunch of white dudes like them, we're not going to be like oh wow what
[2782.54 → 2787.50] a cool what a cool galaxy they've created that's totally different from somewhere that I could have
[2787.50 → 2792.62] walked down the street and gone like that would have been stupid diversity is is is foundational
[2792.62 → 2799.26] um but I think they should have just had ray and Finn swap I think that and another thing too is uh
[2799.26 → 2804.54] because the x Stormtrooper had no character development or story arc whatsoever they should
[2804.54 → 2813.42] have had all the stormtroopers what's that it has no issue killing all his yeah exactly I think that ray
[2813.42 → 2820.30] the trooper okay should have actually had like a really dark history, and we should see her do
[2821.18 → 2828.54] something awful before something happens like some kind of some kind of catalyst needs to take place
[2828.54 → 2833.90] she's perfect she would be perfect for it, you actually don't have to alter either of those
[2833.90 → 2839.58] characters at all you just need to put them in each other's roles you need to let that romance blossom
[2839.58 → 2844.54] the way that it was obviously supposed to uh you need to let them both be force sensitive the way
[2844.54 → 2849.02] that they were obviously supposed to the other really cool thing that this does for ray oh yeah i
[2849.02 → 2853.90] totally forgot about this when I was talking to someone else about it is that it adds some legitimacy
[2853.90 → 2861.18] whatsoever to the whole conflicted part of her story because that whole thing where she's like
[2861.18 → 2868.38] shooting force lightning one moment and then force healing the next moment is just it is just doesn't
[2868.38 → 2873.50] make any sense it's just stupid, and you could be like oh well yeah well it's just all fake it's like
[2873.50 → 2879.66] yeah it's all fake but if I just wrote a completely incoherent garbage screenplay where nothing meshed
[2879.66 → 2886.70] with anything else that would also be fake, and it would also be bad so if she actually did something
[2886.70 → 2893.90] really, really awful at the beginning of that movie you know she is um she is Kylo Ren's, or she's a knight of
[2893.90 → 2901.34] men okay like give her some kind of significance now we're talking we've got kind of uh you know
[2901.34 → 2907.50] bumbling Finn getting kind of swept up into all of this you know maybe he falls for her in
[2907.50 → 2912.06] spite of the fact that she's got this like evil side maybe they work through that together they both get
[2912.06 → 2920.38] actual character arcs as it is so much already they've got nothing and you could have done all of
[2920.38 → 2926.94] that without even upsetting the people that are like uh main characters are fulfilling diversity
[2926.94 → 2933.42] quotas blah blah blah because those actors in those roles would have been fantastic and those stories
[2933.42 → 2940.78] would have been ones that I would have wanted to hear as it was we had a Stormtrooper who was just like
[2941.58 → 2948.78] you know honestly kind of a and never actually did anything um who then goes on to not really actually do
[2948.78 → 2953.18] anything, and it's just like a sequence of events and I don't even I don't even blame anyone his
[2953.18 → 2959.58] character is so wasted completely wasted there are so many ways even the like force sensitive
[2959.58 → 2964.30] thing near the end which they tease so many times throughout that movie and then when you get out of
[2964.30 → 2970.94] it you're like wait that that was it, and you know what the issue too is though is that because i I guess
[2970.94 → 2977.18] because of this attitude that it's just all fake anyway so who cares um they take so many liberties with
[2977.18 → 2984.86] the way that uh the way that the universe you know works right um like I got really upset when r2d2
[2984.86 → 2990.30] sprouted jetpacks in the prequel trilogy for the same reasons as if r2d2 doesn't have jetpacks to
[2990.30 → 2996.38] launch himself out of the swamp and dago bah in uh in empire strikes back excuse me then he doesn't have
[2996.38 → 3002.62] jetpacks to fly around and comically amuse the kids um you know and bop the droids or whatever and I think
[3002.62 → 3009.82] it's phantom menace um but so many people complained about how ray was like this super op force user
[3009.82 → 3015.74] right that was a common complaint we can all agree on that and there was a lot of
[3015.74 → 3022.70] speculation that like oh well it's because you know they're trying to pander to um you know people who
[3022.70 → 3026.30] think you know women should have more leading roles or whatever else it's its all diversity
[3026.30 → 3031.74] quota it's all diversity quota no it's just bad storytelling, and they did it all over the place
[3031.74 → 3039.26] you know look at the first scene where we meet POE Cameron it's ridiculous do you remember it
[3040.06 → 3045.18] yeah I'm thinking about it right now yeah it's that ground battle where he basically rips in
[3045.18 → 3051.66] and is clearly like if we were to go into the actual like files okay the animation files the CGI
[3051.66 → 3059.10] we go in he's ripping around at literally 4x the speed of anything else in the air flying with reflexes
[3059.10 → 3064.94] that isn't that's not when we first meet POE Cameron right is it I believe that's our first
[3064.94 → 3071.50] introduction to him isn't it I thought we come in pretty early with Finn coming off the ship
[3072.06 → 3078.14] and they're fighting on the ground and like POE shoots okay sorry okay whatever yeah I think you're
[3078.14 → 3082.38] right I think you're right so sorry the one no not the one where we meet him then the one where
[3082.38 → 3087.34] he rips in with his x-wing when they're fighting on the ground and just he meets like the crew he meets the
[3087.34 → 3093.66] rest of the no the heroes yeah no look headshots absolutely everything flying around at triple to
[3093.66 → 3098.46] quadruple the speed of anything else in the air, and you're looking at it going yeah you're looking at
[3098.46 → 3105.26] it going well that's just that's just stupid you know the best pilots in the galaxy you know a short
[3105.26 → 3113.90] 20 years ago or whatever could not do that right um yeah almost certainly better training etc, and he's
[3113.90 → 3119.90] not force sensitive well theoretically I mean Hannah is so who knows yeah
[3123.10 → 3128.70] yeah so you know what i i think his attitude is basically why Star Wars is dead to me
[3128.70 → 3134.54] and it should be dead to you because if they don't care at all about continuity, and they're just going
[3134.54 → 3143.42] to go in and keep trying to fix one thing while breaking three others it is only going to get worse
[3145.34 → 3155.42] yeah um i i I don't know i I haven't I actually haven't watched the new um Star Wars clone wars
[3155.42 → 3160.70] series that came out um but the feedback that I've been seeing I've been trying to stay away from
[3160.70 → 3166.62] spoilers because I want to watch it all properly um but the feedback that I've been seeing uh is
[3166.62 → 3173.02] really positive and the Mandalorian was awesome, and it was mediocre you were just desperate
[3174.94 → 3179.74] okay it's awesome compared to the three most recent movies it's Millville in space
[3181.26 → 3187.50] that's fine compared to the three most recent movies I watched the whole thing so like I clearly made it
[3187.50 → 3192.54] through it like, but it's its it's Millville in space it's monster of the week it's Buffy okay
[3193.18 → 3197.66] okay I'm not saying it's the greatest thing ever, but it's the three most recent movies okay it's
[3197.66 → 3203.18] bewitched three most recent movies that's that show right von bewitched is that it'd be
[3203.18 → 3207.18] which is that that show where they're all like teen witches or something and there's like a monster
[3207.18 → 3211.26] and they have to defeat it I haven't seen any of these shows so I don't really charmed sorry
[3211.26 → 3216.62] it's charmed not bewitched it's charmed it's Millville that's what it is I don't watch
[3216.62 → 3221.02] shows very often just fine compared to the three most recent movies' integer overlord by the way just
[3221.02 → 3227.66] says hey there's like 150 like expanded uh or well previously expanded universe books that managed to
[3227.66 → 3232.86] keep the story straight here's an idea why don't you just use that I know right that's what everyone
[3232.86 → 3237.58] wanted them to do there is a bunch of garbage in there, but there's also a lot of
[3237.58 → 3243.98] awesomeness I've had a perfect time going through the EU okay I'm sorry i I was I really was
[3243.98 → 3247.82] being very rude I wasn't listening to your question hit me one more time one more time okay
[3248.54 → 3252.70] compare the Mandalorian instead of on its own yeah compare the Mandalorian against the
[3252.70 → 3262.22] most recent three movies it's much worse than firefly okay yeah I mean yeah it is maybe a third
[3262.22 → 3265.82] as good as firefly instead of comparing it on its own
[3265.82 → 3273.66] compare the case of those three movies because there are some interesting aspects there too they
[3273.66 → 3281.66] said to I mean if you think about it, he has to craft this show while these movies are coming out
[3282.30 → 3284.86] uh yeah and they had to like
[3286.94 → 3293.42] they had to work things into the show to explain stuff that was going to happen in the upcoming movie
[3293.42 → 3298.54] right and there's like there are things that happen in the show that only happen in that show because
[3298.54 → 3305.90] the upcoming movie was coming yeah, and they were like oh no we need to do something um like when uh
[3307.66 → 3312.22] when uh baby Yoda force heals yeah that's there because of the new movie
[3314.14 → 3318.14] I read this whole thing about it, they were trying to like soft introduce it to the community so that
[3318.14 → 3321.98] people didn't freak out so much with the movie it didn't really save them at all but no it didn't
[3321.98 → 3327.50] because it was still stupid because there were still so many issues you know like why didn't
[3327.50 → 3333.58] Obi-Wan just like force heal Quinton why didn't everybody just force heal everyone every why didn't
[3333.58 → 3338.46] Quinton just force heal Quinton yeah I mean because I mean there's all I mean there are so many problems
[3338.46 → 3342.62] like we could go, and we could find problems everywhere but just some of them I don't find as
[3342.62 → 3349.34] offensive you know like um lightsabres for example the o penis of a lightsabre has been a little
[3349.34 → 3356.14] bit inconsistent okay so on the one hand you've got Luke and Vader battling in be spin right in cloud
[3356.14 → 3363.18] city um and Luke uh hits Vader in the shoulder, and it doesn't like to cut off his arm all right
[3365.18 → 3373.02] um yeah then another example of you know lightsabres not being you know super de duper op would be when
[3373.02 → 3377.66] uh Quinton and Obi-Wan are cutting their way out of the room where they're being held right at the
[3377.66 → 3382.86] beginning of phantom menace slow right okay, so these are instances where are not of cutting
[3382.86 → 3385.90] their right of the room cutting their way into the other room whatever the point is they put it through
[3385.90 → 3390.54] and it's like it takes a long time to cut if it's more like a plasma cutter at that point
[3391.02 → 3398.94] um but then sorry then there are just there are instances where lightsabres seem to slice through
[3398.94 → 3405.98] anything instantly right, so there are inconsistencies but i can accept I don't know if that's
[3405.98 → 3410.62] completely fair yeah I don't know if the lightsabre yeah because you don't know what that stuff is made
[3410.62 → 3417.90] of and if you look at uh like material science on earth there are materials that will damage or
[3417.90 → 3424.70] cut or scrape or whatever certain other materials instantly that look very similar to ones that they
[3424.70 → 3433.42] will do next to nothing too um and I think another example of the o penis yeah calculation uh Obi-Wan's
[3433.42 → 3440.38] lightsabre completely failing against Vader yes there 's's very few times that we see something
[3440.38 → 3447.26] like that again it's mentioned in the EU a bit yep um there 's's a fascinating book with
[3447.26 → 3453.34] mace window where he has to like recharge his lightsabre um I don't remember what one it is but
[3455.02 → 3459.98] it's an it's a bit of a's an interesting book it's kind of like a thriller anyway so the biggest
[3459.98 → 3465.98] problem is basically just that they don't have any consistency, and it's so far gone that i
[3465.98 → 3472.70] don't think anyone cares anymore, and so they're saying Dave pretty much cares if we don't care then no one
[3472.70 → 3481.02] should care so yeah I'm out the saltier than crate Subreddit cares I'm done I think a lot of other
[3481.02 → 3485.10] people care Dave felony cares people still Carolina you know what I care you know what our audience
[3485.10 → 3491.58] cares about tech so here it is LG we should move back on to tech LG is working on a new dual screen
[3491.58 → 3499.50] phone that apparently swivels horizontally this is a gem all right this is a gem I'm going to go
[3499.50 → 3505.74] ahead and screen share you guys on this because I absolutely love this thing here we go boom right like
[3505.74 → 3513.98] that yeah you like that okay so it swivels 90 degrees so you can have the best of
[3513.98 → 3522.22] both worlds while you also have the worst of both worlds you can I've been informed it's you
[3522.22 → 3527.02] can eat your cake and have it too not you can have your cake and eat it too so you get to eat your cake
[3527.02 → 3534.30] and have it too and your cake is made of boogers and your mouth is your mouth is cut up with razor
[3534.30 → 3539.74] blades before you eat it and there's lemon juice okay that's the kind of cake you're having and
[3540.78 → 3548.22] that's this phone so the back of it swivels out so you can use it in a portrait mode with a
[3548.22 → 3552.78] keyboard which is the best way to use an on-screen keyboard landscape is literally just slower you just
[3552.78 → 3557.50] have to move your thumbs farther um you know it's not like it's making more room for more fingers or
[3557.50 → 3562.70] anything, so this is good, and then you could like to watch a movie or have liked you know a
[3563.26 → 3569.10] side-by-side multitasking experience or whatever the case may be if you're into that sort of thing and
[3569.10 → 3574.46] they are not going to sell a lot of these and um it's called the wing okay it's called the wing
[3574.46 → 3582.30] because they're just winging it at this point hey got them it's so weird
[3583.18 → 3588.70] I want to hear from you guys oh Carn evil over on float plane it's hideous I'll take six
[3589.42 → 3595.34] this is like I don't even this doesn't matter at all yeah the image that they used
[3595.34 → 3601.50] for the background of the currently horizontal screen is horrible yeah I don't even know what that
[3601.50 → 3607.82] is I don't know yeah it's like weird aliasing going all over it I don't know there 's's there's like
[3607.82 → 3614.06] weird blurry parts for no reason they just weren't trying at all I don't know yeah I mean pretty
[3614.06 → 3619.66] similar to probably the idea of this phone in general it's astounding to me that the one
[3619.66 → 3625.58] dual screen concept that works okay I shouldn't say one because I haven't actually tried Microsoft's
[3625.58 → 3631.66] thing Microsoft's concept yet um but the one dual screen android concept that I really liked
[3631.66 → 3636.22] having the screen on the front and the back and then just one camera instead of having a selfie
[3636.22 → 3642.54] camera so that back screen is basically just to like use to preview your selfies um never really
[3642.54 → 3648.62] took off with any manufacturers that matter like it was all it was all little ones that uh that went
[3648.62 → 3654.46] for that whereas like if I had the option to use my Samsung rear-facing shooter for my selfies instead
[3654.46 → 3661.66] of having a punch a hole punched in my main display that would be so much better if all the r d that has
[3661.66 → 3668.14] gone into hole punch displays and front-facing cameras could have just been spent on making rear-facing
[3668.14 → 3673.66] cameras better and putting a crappy small screen on the back of the phone that would have just been
[3673.66 → 3682.22] better in every possible way video chatting is an application where it is not as good go get your tablet
[3684.46 → 3690.14] or make the screen not that small and crappy if they release this which it sounds like they're
[3690.14 → 3696.94] actually going to wow just I mean just in the verbiage that is being used I don't see any
[3696.94 → 3701.10] statement that says we are definitely releasing this phone they're just in the verbiage that is being used
[3701.10 → 3706.70] yeah it sounds like they're going to if they release this will you mainline it for a certain
[3706.70 → 3715.34] period of time no uh yeah I will sure I'll do it for the Lulu I'll do it I'll do it I love that
[3715.34 → 3724.46] painful retraction I'll do it I'll do it basically like a slider except worse in every way uh it's got
[3724.46 → 3730.62] a snapdragon 700 series processor with 5g support so low-end chip uh triple camera set up with
[3730.62 → 3736.06] 64 megapixel primary sensor, but it's LG so it's going to be like and the price is expected to be just over
[3736.06 → 3742.14] 800 us dollars in fairness I guess there's a lot of validation that goes into building a bad phone
[3742.14 → 3751.74] but um hey they did it so you know they have to get paid to yeah uh I have an actually a line off the
[3751.74 → 3756.94] shelves you know what in line with my uh my conversation earlier about how super chats are
[3756.94 → 3760.30] actually a great value they're not I usually don't look at them because where this is the
[3760.30 → 3765.98] wan show, and we don't do a ton of q a so I'm not actually defending that um but in line
[3765.98 → 3769.90] with that I actually do have a super chat that I went out of my way to answer over the course of
[3769.90 → 3773.34] this week because I didn't have a good answer from someone last week, and it's kind of an interesting
[3773.34 → 3779.74] discussion, so someone asked does demonetize content get paid by YouTube premium subscribers
[3779.74 → 3785.74] do you remember talking about this so if you yes is you've got a yellow icon um and someone with
[3785.74 → 3790.62] YouTube premium watches where there is no advertiser relationship for YouTube to worry about
[3791.42 → 3797.26] do they still get your YouTube premium revenue and I got an answer back from creator help and
[3797.26 → 3804.22] they said it depends on what type of demonetization it is if it's a copyright claim uh claim you
[3804.22 → 3809.02] will not be able to earn any of the revenue including premium that will go to the copyright holder
[3809.02 → 3817.18] if it's a yellow icon so that is to say that like um you've talked about the controversial
[3817.18 → 3823.02] coronavirus at a time when that was considered um I forget what it fell under, but it was
[3823.02 → 3830.14] you weren't eligible for monetization because it was like uh, uh man I don't I don't remember it
[3830.14 → 3835.90] doesn't matter uh the point is yeah it was bad news there that's that's about it um so if it's
[3835.90 → 3841.18] something like that you should be eligible to earn premium, and it will note so on the icon if you hover
[3841.18 → 3847.82] over it so here's a screenshot that I can share with you guys which is cool it's nice that their
[3847.82 → 3853.66] answer to that question was like look at the thing yeah check this out it's nice that that wasn't hidden
[3854.54 → 3859.10] this video is running limited or no ads due to content identified as not suitable, but it remains
[3859.10 → 3864.70] fully playable and is eligible to earn subscription revenue from youtube premium really
[3864.70 → 3870.94] is one of the best ways if you're not willing to go over on float plane and support creators it really
[3870.94 → 3878.70] is one of the best ways to dramatically increase the amount of um contribution that you're making to
[3878.70 → 3882.62] your favourite creators and I'm not I'm not saying just me I'm saying if you get a YouTube premium
[3882.62 → 3891.42] subscription it completely changes the game I was talking to our YouTube uh contact about uh here let me
[3891.42 → 3898.38] just find this um blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it had a few back and forth so I'm trying to find
[3898.38 → 3906.94] the right one uh but I was talking about how the heck it is that some of our long format content does so
[3906.94 → 3915.58] much better than our shorter videos when it comes to AdSense, and he basically said well I think you're not
[3915.58 → 3922.94] digging deep enough into the analytics because I thought that even though we don't run mid-rolls on
[3922.94 → 3930.22] our long format content I thought that for some reason the fact that it had higher retention or
[3930.22 → 3937.98] something was causing it to uh to pay out at a higher rate, but it's not actually like that I need to find
[3937.98 → 3945.90] this where is it issuing with view analytics no um okay Luke do you want to stall for time for a little
[3945.90 → 3952.78] bit for me today while i try and find this thing uh TSMC theoretically allegedly potentially
[3952.78 → 3961.18] planning on opening a fab in the US by 2023 it would be a 12 billion dollar construction in Arizona
[3961.18 → 3968.86] uh they're planning to produce five nanometre chips starting in 2023 expected capacity is to be 20 000
[3968.86 → 3977.26] silicon wafers per month uh this would have to be heavily subsidized uh it is unclear exactly how much
[3977.82 → 3984.94] but according to TSMC chairman mark Liu it is more expensive to operate in the US unsurprising uh than
[3984.94 → 3992.14] Taiwan or the or or or china I presume, so the company will require major subsidies uh this is
[3992.14 → 3997.34] apparently in in in the works potentially because there are fears that intel will build its future
[3997.34 → 4004.22] chip plants in China or Taiwan uh experts believe that it is crucial for the US to invest more in fabs
[4004.22 → 4012.06] like Taiwan and china and Israel actually as well have done um and with ramping tensions with china that
[4012.06 → 4021.82] that kind of makes sense um apparently it's already confirmed wow um that's quick okay, okay, so this is
[4021.82 → 4028.46] pretty sweet so here's one quick thing sorry I just want to finish um IAN cut dr IAN sutras said uh by
[4028.46 → 4033.74] this time five nanometers won't be the leading edge, but it will take some of the volume pressure off of
[4033.74 → 4041.34] Taiwan's fabs at 20 000 wafers uh wafer starts per month it's nowhere near the giraffes that do a
[4041.34 → 4046.62] hundred thousand that's assuming they break ground at all I have my doubts well apparently it's been
[4046.62 → 4052.38] confirmed it is three years out we will see if they actually do break ground but yeah the lower
[4052.38 → 4059.74] production amounts etc, etc yeah okay, so this is interesting as it sounds this is pretty
[4059.74 → 4065.82] interesting uh there are two videos here uh back to how much of a difference YouTube premium makes
[4065.82 → 4070.86] I've got two videos here one of them is building an epic portable gaming rig at home that's a video
[4070.86 → 4076.06] that performed quite well for us about around two million views and then there's another video um
[4077.66 → 4081.98] oh wait no it's about one million one million and then there's another video ultimate IKEA gaming
[4081.98 → 4086.22] desk that is about two million and I sent these over to our rep because I was confused I said here's
[4086.22 → 4095.82] the thing ultimate IKEA gaming desk did uh let's let's use uh let's use x okay did 3x revenue okay at
[4095.82 → 4104.06] 2 million views and building a portable gaming rig at home did 2.5x revenue at 1 million views so at half
[4104.06 → 4113.50] the views it was five sixth of the revenue crazy right so I had been attributing this to just uh you
[4113.50 → 4118.14] know long format even though we don't run mid-rolls but what it actually turned out to be
[4118.14 → 4125.34] was that hold on let me make sure I've got the colour coding right here ah yes okay so the ultimate
[4125.34 → 4132.78] IKEA gaming desk the two million view video did about double the AdSense so the like partner ad revenue
[4132.78 → 4138.70] of the other one it was right in line because we don't run mid-rolls and then building an epic portable
[4138.70 → 4146.22] gaming rig at home even though it had half as many views actually did about looks like about 20 percent
[4146.22 → 4158.06] more than the one with twice as many views crazy right, so those views are actually worth um like
[4158.06 → 4164.14] many times like it's even more extreme than I knew they're worth many more times especially
[4164.14 → 4170.86] for longer format content where it's uh it's weighted by watch time so I thought that was
[4170.86 → 4176.30] very interesting and I thought I would share that with you guys because uh someone asked last week and
[4176.30 → 4184.78] I said that I would get them an answer cool more topics or super chats uh let's get through some super
[4184.78 → 4194.86] chats speaking of uh super chance all right we got at least a few in here that we definitely got to
[4194.86 → 4199.50] do Tyler Yates says it's 1am and I'm still up so I figured wet the hay why not finally watch this live
[4199.50 → 4208.22] heck yeah good work Tyler Yates thanks Oliver Brody Nathan Warwick says learned a new way to eat corn
[4208.22 → 4217.02] oh Lord oh man my son managed to make it on r slash live stream fails yesterday because he was
[4217.02 → 4222.46] eating a piece of corn by putting the entire end of the corn in his mouth and picking off with his
[4222.46 → 4230.14] front teeth one kernel at a time and then taking it all the way out and eating it and I was like please stop
[4230.14 → 4242.86] that's just like a kid will be kids kind of moment yeah I know, but it's just unfortunate you should
[4242.86 → 4248.86] have seen me eat a pickle when I was like you know eight years old like it is what it is but yeah
[4249.74 → 4255.66] now it's live um yeah exactly that's that's going to be kind of the unfortunate thing about his generation
[4255.66 → 4263.74] I think yeah now there's a clip of it on live stream fails and like there's also so much content
[4263.74 → 4270.62] that I actually have in some ways a harder time finding an old meme these days depending how viral
[4270.62 → 4278.30] it went you know yep that's fair Robert mail it's not going to make it go any faster dude um Tommy gun
[4278.30 → 4284.46] heard you need a new ratchet screwdriver uh I can't say anything but I don't oh
[4285.98 → 4291.98] that's all I have to say about that uh what else we got here Dom r last week uh Luke said the more
[4291.98 → 4297.90] we bug you about stuff the more it will happen I want wan show shirts it's not how it works big
[4297.90 → 4307.58] facts it's not how it works Luke lied to you hashtag lie you city uh lie you like yeah lie you uh lost
[4307.58 → 4313.82] boy says sorry to hear about LTT men uh take my money in other forms I think you mean Ltd and thank you
[4313.82 → 4316.86] wow I was a 50 super chat you crazy
[4319.66 → 4323.74] uh Lucas says well loving the work from home videos my kids have the same toy kitchen and
[4323.74 → 4327.18] also wreck the faucet in the same way yeah they're so cheap it's like it's hard to find
[4327.18 → 4332.30] like good quality kids toys you know uh terry says folding at home numbers are down we're trailing
[4332.30 → 4339.34] default and daily production come on team let's get folding again actually the motherboard
[4339.34 → 4343.50] failed in our monster folding rig so we got a new one in, but it's going to take a while with all that
[4343.50 → 4349.90] water cooling in it to get it swapped out so there's that uh mentality is Linus Luke's little brother no
[4349.90 → 4357.98] we don't even look that similar to look at us, you have a beard now you have blue eyes yeah exactly
[4359.10 → 4359.98] like you're blonde
[4362.46 → 4368.78] uh Jensen's uh hr penguin says Jensen should reveal the 3080 ti by pulling it out of the microwave it is
[4368.78 → 4374.14] consumer level after all I like it, I'm into it, I don't know if he is mean his he might have a microwave
[4374.14 → 4380.06] if they've made a microwave out of like volcanic glass and stonework I know right sure if
[4380.06 → 4385.66] they have I don't know if it would match his kitchen otherwise uh sergeant Amos thank you very much
[4386.22 → 4390.86] a dozen I recently watched the video where you re-soldered dozen CPU pins and noticed that when
[4390.86 → 4396.22] they're removed it looks like a LGA chip at that point would it fit into an intel motherboard heck no
[4396.22 → 4401.50] heck no they would not be they would not be intel compatible just by removing the pins
[4401.50 → 4409.26] the real smiley says bah aha ha you busted me being a butt Linus I retract my statement on super chats
[4409.26 → 4415.18] by super chats thank you real smiley I know I'm not actually endorsing the statement you're making
[4415.18 → 4420.54] there because generally speaking they're not a great value, and we often forget to get to them but uh
[4420.54 → 4428.94] hey at least you got your money's worth I guess oof bald says tophi Linda or lee Chong way took off Gaza
[4428.94 → 4435.98] of course all right, so the problem with that question is that it only has one obvious answer
[4436.78 → 4442.70] Linda um, but this is a badminton I'm still I'm still I'm still lee Chong way for life okay that's
[4442.70 → 4446.70] that's how I feel about it and there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind
[4446.70 → 4453.42] yes it's badminton I'm going to recognize some of those names I'm going back to badminton next week
[4455.02 → 4461.02] I want a sport that we can play that you aren't so astronomically far ahead of me in football
[4462.06 → 4463.34] but that's the opposite problem
[4463.34 → 4466.38] yeah I was like sure
[4470.14 → 4474.70] well no what we have to do is we have to pick up a new sport that's the trick yeah so we just have to
[4474.70 → 4480.30] try something new can't be swimming because you suck at that no offence yep can't be badminton you're
[4480.30 → 4484.86] terrible that's fine you could get better i think you actually do have some potential for
[4484.86 → 4489.58] badminton um I'm definitely down to try for badminton, but it's going to be a painful beginning it
[4489.58 → 4494.54] would be it would be like a 10 year 10-year battle you know yeah you'd have to get continuously
[4494.54 → 4498.46] better over the next 10 years and I'd probably have to get a little worse and I'd have to yeah
[4498.46 → 4504.14] I'd have to that's seen that's kind of the issue is I'd have to get better at a at a rate that's
[4505.42 → 4509.74] much higher than the rate that you are actively getting better as well right because yeah I'm going
[4509.74 → 4514.94] to keep training, so yeah there's that so okay we need sport we need sport recommendations ladies and
[4514.94 → 4522.94] gentlemen yeah come on hit us up Sammy phone says I hate podcasts why am I here because this
[4522.94 → 4530.30] isn't a podcast this is far crappier than a podcast and that's why you like it uh Wang LU says uh stay
[4530.30 → 4534.70] healthy everyone rob white says think we will see john again in tech linked or will he be staying in the
[4534.70 → 4541.98] U.S. uh we bring john up um typically twice a year at least uh we like to bring him up for workation
[4541.98 → 4547.50] uh or like whatever our corporate get-together is for the year, and we always bring him up for the
[4547.50 → 4552.54] company Christmas party um that's something that's very important to me having everybody there it's uh
[4552.54 → 4557.74] it's sort of an inside joke at Linus media group the Christmas party is optional but you better be there
[4562.86 → 4569.66] speaking of which um flow plane usually not usually I guess there hasn't been a ton of these
[4569.66 → 4575.50] uh last year, and we were going to do this moving forward yeah we have the float plane team meetup
[4575.50 → 4580.14] around Ltd because well probably I know right people on the team are going to be interested in that
[4580.14 → 4586.22] so that's not going to work anymore, and it's very possible that around that time if we try to do
[4586.22 → 4591.74] something at that time it would still be very ill-advised to travel so potentially the team meetup
[4591.74 → 4598.54] for float plane this year is just off does anyone have any ideas of what we should do so far I have ideas
[4598.54 → 4605.58] but they're not that great so um we do have some suggestions for sports uh bowling okay I don't
[4605.58 → 4612.86] think I'm white enough to bowl yeah like seriously like to seriously bowl um pickleball I would destroy
[4612.86 → 4616.94] Luke at pickleball it's basically badminton done uh frizz golf
[4619.98 → 4628.38] I suck at it me too okay frizz golf we have a contender curling Luke would just absolutely
[4628.78 → 4636.86] wreck me at curling like that would no it would not be pretty paintball I actually okay, okay I was yeah
[4637.42 → 4643.34] I actually meant to ask you like a week ago yeah if you would be interested I was thinking airsoft
[4643.34 → 4648.70] because it's easier to clean up and if we're doing it very often yeah it would make more sense but yeah
[4648.70 → 4657.10] yeah i it's a good cardio sport you know what i actually last season i um i I forget why I did it
[4657.10 → 4662.06] I wanted to use my paintball gun for something like just target practice in the backyard or something
[4662.06 → 4669.34] I found out it was broken so I like got it all sorted out i I fixed up my mark my marker I oiled
[4669.34 → 4675.42] everything up I actually got a new um I got a new tank because I found a good deal on one I fixed up my
[4675.42 → 4684.78] mask I got a backup mask I am like I am ready to go to play some paintball so yeah a field sport like
[4684.78 → 4692.06] that sounds really fun to me, I'm super down for some paintball um cool oleic says start the training
[4692.06 → 4699.50] montage softball I would actually love to play softball I just don't think I can commit the
[4699.50 → 4708.38] time to join the team yeah a pickup game style sport would probably be a better idea yeah JC sand
[4708.38 → 4712.86] says game gear oh yeah I was going to talk about that uh I dug uh an old game gear out it's not
[4712.86 → 4718.22] actually mine from when I was a kid, but it's like obviously the same game as same game console and
[4718.22 → 4725.74] my kids absolutely love it even though we have a switch VR games galore Wii U like we've got so much
[4725.74 → 4732.06] gaming gear in the house and yet something about just the simplicity of like two buttons and
[4734.06 → 4739.02] a little thing that you just hold in your hand they they they were like obsessed with it yesterday
[4739.02 → 4749.10] it only came up because there's this I think it's called is it called the retro gen uh crap no it's not
[4749.10 → 4755.90] retro gen hold on I shot it this week so it's going to be in my Trello here uh but I shot
[4755.90 → 4761.58] a video overcame it's about the so overcame is this handheld console that's got officially licensed
[4761.58 → 4768.46] old games from like interplay Atari like that kind of thing and uh my son shot the unboxing with
[4768.46 → 4772.30] me for short circuit and I promised him that he could play with it after and then I went and sent it
[4772.30 → 4778.22] back to the office um without remembering to let him play with it, and he was like oh well what the
[4778.22 → 4782.78] heck dad and I was like oh well you know what I've got it's basically the same thing and I had this game
[4782.78 → 4787.10] gear just sitting in the attic that I hadn't like touched since I acquired it as a prop a while back
[4787.66 → 4791.50] and as far as he was concerned it was the same thing and then my daughters were like wow that's so
[4791.50 → 4795.02] cool, and they were all they're all playing with it, I just thought it was really neat because that was
[4795.02 → 4801.26] I was his age I was one year older than my son when I got a game gear for Christmas and I even had the
[4801.26 → 4804.94] same games that I played he was trying the uh the Lion King game for game gear actually very good
[4809.50 → 4817.50] and I think that's pretty much it for the wan show yeah um Tom's hold on a second I got a super
[4817.50 → 4823.90] chat tom cigar says I folded 25 million for LTT thanks for schooling me what the f is this you have
[4823.90 → 4829.26] been placed in timeout by the owner of this video or moderator i I don't know why you're in timeout but
[4829.26 → 4834.78] it was a moderator not me so apparently you got past it by paying to chat that's really not the
[4834.78 → 4843.66] intended way for the system to work oh my goodness no you says uh see that Facebook acquired jiffy i
[4843.66 → 4852.14] actually did not see that and apparently Facebook uh settled the post-traumatic stress disorder thing to
[4852.14 → 4855.66] its content moderators I did not actually see that either all right well there you go thanks for watching
[4855.66 → 4861.34] guys we'll see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[4865.42 → 4865.66] uh

[4877.74 → 4885.02] YouTube stream and stream and stream bye guys what max steel says game gear sucked you suck
[4889.10 → 4890.86] let me know when we're off yeah I'm rolling that intro
[4896.46 → 4897.90] not quite I'm still live
