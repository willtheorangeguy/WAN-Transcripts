[0.00 --> 15.84]  and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show for you lined up today
[15.84 --> 24.20]  nvidia apologized to some people uh for the the whole shenanigans that went on last week we'll
[24.20 --> 30.74]  talk about that a little bit in other news devotion has been pulled from good old games in
[30.74 --> 38.78]  yet more positive pr for cd project red remember when cd project red was like the the darlings and
[38.78 --> 47.14]  now they're like everyone yeah over the course of like a three-week period just yeah a little
[47.14 --> 52.06]  little a little uncomfortable a little uncomfortable what else we got this week
[52.06 --> 58.92]  google is getting sued in antitrust um in a in a case that should probably go along with a
[58.92 --> 68.58]  finally um and then also there was a massive hack of the cdc time war cable u.s air force
[68.58 --> 75.90]  u.s department of defense u.s postal service u.s uh secret service visa usa um all of those are
[75.90 --> 82.00]  maybe a little sketchy because solarwinds orion software was hacked oopsie daisies hooray
[82.00 --> 83.06]  intro time
[83.06 --> 107.78]  this is great loft wanderer says i feel bad for cd project red
[107.78 --> 116.32]  do you though do you really did they not make their own bed here like i uh i don't know i don't
[116.32 --> 122.12]  know if they're the victim um why don't we jump right into our first topic of the week which is of
[122.12 --> 131.98]  course nvidia apologizing sort of now when i say sort of i don't mean that they sort of apologized to
[131.98 --> 138.52]  hardware unboxed in fact the apology to hardware unboxed was uh pretty pretty good sounding to me
[138.52 --> 144.04]  uh he went ahead and published it i can't remember where but i think it's in my twitter dm so i'm just
[144.04 --> 150.70]  going to read it out from there uh oh man we got so much twitter dm going on here
[150.70 --> 160.02]  oh there's a big history luke if you can find it sooner ah here it is um all right this is great
[160.02 --> 165.96]  great message from him yeah this reads like bdr actually wrote it hi steve i wanted to reach out
[165.96 --> 172.82]  again and apologize for my previous email it was not well worded and maybe impacted by a bit of
[172.82 --> 178.72]  lockdown fatigue we absolutely respect the press and their editorial integrity we welcome you and
[178.72 --> 184.60]  hardware unboxed to nda press briefings access to press material early press drivers and access to our
[184.60 --> 190.18]  partner slash aic boards as well as founders edition boards let me know if you have any questions
[190.18 --> 197.74]  brian del rizzo and you know what that does read a lot more to me like it was actually written by bdr
[197.74 --> 203.66]  which the other one to be clear so many people have raised their pitchforks calling for brian del
[203.66 --> 215.04]  rizzo's head guys here's the thing brian del rizzo works for nvidia um an email like that never goes out
[215.04 --> 224.88]  without prior approval from someone i mean he he's gonna usually be that someone he would usually be
[224.88 --> 230.28]  that someone which is why the fact that it was signed signed by him means someone else looked at
[230.28 --> 237.30]  it there is always another set of eyes on a communication like that and the fact that it
[237.30 --> 244.86]  doesn't sound like it was written by him at all means that clearly this was this was a this must have
[244.86 --> 251.22]  been a whole mess of a thing over there and on the subject of messes of a thing it was pretty clear
[251.22 --> 259.28]  why nvidia immediately walked it back but the question that i have luke for you is do you feel
[259.28 --> 266.94]  like they issued their apology the next day like it happened literally the day after the wan show it was
[266.94 --> 273.32]  on saturday that they that they issued the first apology then they sent out another message it was either
[273.32 --> 279.64]  the day after or on monday or something like that do you think nvidia apologized because they're sorry
[279.64 --> 288.00]  or because they're sorry they got caught that's what i want to know i don't know i one of the issues
[288.00 --> 294.18]  with entities that big is i know they become personified and that's like literally a thing
[294.18 --> 300.54]  beyond just perception like that's a way that things work but um it is so many different moving parts
[300.54 --> 306.96]  and like having worked with them before i would definitely say that some people there were
[306.96 --> 314.18]  probably sorry and that some people there were probably sorry that they got caught um and i don't
[314.18 --> 320.98]  i don't necessarily know which one the overall is i'm not sure if um i don't see
[320.98 --> 328.24]  this doesn't necessarily look like the exact same one i'm seeing but the the one you're reading did it
[328.24 --> 336.92]  end with vanx comma bdr uh this one says um no just brian del rizzo
[336.92 --> 342.84]  yeah okay so here one second i just want to send you this
[342.84 --> 343.46]  sure
[343.46 --> 353.28]  and checking chat okay so this is a different one uh brian del rizzo has reached out a second time
[353.28 --> 357.90]  so this was posted on twitter by hardware unboxed okay some people are asking for a little bit of
[357.90 --> 362.88]  context for this they apparently missed the when show last week uh nvidia reached out to hardware
[362.88 --> 371.10]  unboxed uh tech youtuber and basically said if you guys don't get in line with how we feel about ray
[371.10 --> 376.68]  tracing being the future of gaming and if you guys don't put more emphasis on ray tracing performance
[376.68 --> 383.14]  in your reviews we are not going to continue to seed you founders edition cards which is a lot bigger
[383.14 --> 387.76]  of a deal than it sounds like because not getting seated founders edition cards basically means you
[387.76 --> 394.22]  can't do launch day content um you know and then the end of it was really the worst i don't know what
[394.22 --> 399.12]  the worst part it was one of the worst parts for sure the end of it was should your editorial
[399.12 --> 405.54]  direction change we'd be happy to revisit this or something along those lines it was brutal
[405.54 --> 414.68]  um so we took issue with that because it was an attack on not just hardware unboxed's uh editorial
[414.68 --> 421.06]  freedom to review the product as they see fit but also a shot across the bow of pretty much
[421.06 --> 428.84]  anyone who covers tech and who is at the mercy of nvidia to cut them off and harm their business
[428.84 --> 435.12]  and so we took issue with that uh we called out we called it out and they walked it back basically
[435.12 --> 440.04]  immediately so the first email was the one i'm about to read now hi steve thanks for your note i
[440.04 --> 444.28]  just wanted to say again how sorry i am for my original email i overstepped my bounds and it's as
[444.28 --> 448.72]  simple as that i love seeing all the ways reviewers test and report on our products and i value your
[448.72 --> 452.48]  contributions suggesting that i would withhold samples because i didn't agree with your commentary
[452.48 --> 457.38]  is simply inexcusable and crossed the line so that's the thing it didn't suggest it was
[457.38 --> 463.62]  it was a statement very clear i failed myself my colleagues and the amazing community of reviewers
[463.62 --> 468.30]  i consider my friends you all work so hard in service of the gaming industry we love you deserved
[468.30 --> 472.10]  better from me i hope you will forgive my mistake and give me the opportunity to be of service to you
[472.10 --> 475.66]  in the future it would be great if you can share this with your fans so they know how i feel
[475.66 --> 479.80]  that was the first retraction
[479.80 --> 490.46]  so you haven't so you basically are saying some people at nvidia are sorry and some are sorry they
[490.46 --> 496.04]  got caught is that is that the vibe i think so because you got to remember it's not like this is
[496.04 --> 501.34]  the first time nvidia has ever behaved in an anti-partner or anti-consumer manner
[501.34 --> 507.18]  yeah i just i just think with with a company that size i think it's like if you tried to
[507.18 --> 514.84]  if you said like okay you know what i am i am globally personifying this um everyone is upset
[514.84 --> 522.58]  about the banner being over our chins apparently are we both too low in frame there i fixed it go ahead
[522.58 --> 530.90]  um i just yeah i don't know if we're deciding like no we have to decide a general attitude for
[530.90 --> 536.40]  the company as a whole i would i mean especially after reading that it feels that they're sorry they
[536.40 --> 544.50]  got caught i suggesting that i would yeah no bs and then it would be great if you could share this
[544.50 --> 550.34]  with your fans please i don't want the heat on me anymore yeah it feels like they're sorry they got
[550.34 --> 557.00]  caught um i i but i am also certain that there are people there that are sorry in general that's all
[557.00 --> 562.98]  i'm saying i'm sure i mean i know for a fact i i can't get anyone on the record about any of this
[562.98 --> 567.34]  which is very frustrating but i know for a fact there are people at nvidia that were just like
[567.34 --> 575.26]  i don't even have any marketing like training and i read that email and i was immediately like
[575.26 --> 582.32]  how was this going to be anything but a disaster like a raging ball of fire coming down upon us
[582.32 --> 586.92]  like what could they possibly have been thinking one of the interesting things that stood out to me
[586.92 --> 596.20]  and i'm probably chasing a nothing burger but the original email was signed off so form formally yeah
[596.20 --> 602.78]  and it had his full name and then i think it had the like in quotes bdr thing yeah this one's just
[602.78 --> 608.78]  bdr yeah well i've i have seen brian sign emails lots of different ways so it's i don't know it's
[608.78 --> 614.02]  tough it's tough to draw a conclusion there like if we want to get into like you know forensic typing
[614.02 --> 620.44]  word analysis it feels like maybe either like maybe one of them is sent because your your email is
[620.44 --> 624.92]  probably going to auto signature so like one of them is sent from like a team account one of them is
[624.92 --> 631.42]  sent from sure his own i don't know i have no idea it's just i just it feels so weird to me that
[631.42 --> 636.10]  it's it's being handled this way at all so i'm trying to like pick it apart and be like
[636.10 --> 642.48]  who the heck is even involved because it's hard to tell uh patrick h says y'all need to realize this
[642.48 --> 647.28]  wasn't bdr's decision to make he had to write the hard email and is the messenger he definitely could
[647.28 --> 651.68]  have felt bad writing the email in the first place that's happened before for sure yeah but i just
[651.68 --> 659.60]  don't believe that's how it went down um i to be clear i don't believe that like i i don't know i
[659.60 --> 667.86]  honestly i've been trying to get someone from nvidia including bdr to talk to me about this and
[667.86 --> 676.80]  pretty much the answer has been um we sent an email to steve it's water under the bridge that's all i
[676.80 --> 685.24]  have to say about that and my response to that is a couple of things um number one is okay you've
[685.24 --> 690.74]  addressed that you did the wrong thing but you haven't explained how that ever could have possibly
[690.74 --> 697.42]  happened in the first place and without a post-mortem on this honestly the apology rings kind
[697.42 --> 704.72]  of hollow for me and number two is you apologized to steve but steve wasn't the only member of the
[704.72 --> 712.84]  media that was outraged that you or someone respected us so little and while while technically
[712.84 --> 721.12]  you you only like punched out at one thing the community feels the hit like it's it's if you're
[721.12 --> 728.04]  if you're a lord over some lands and you go roll into someone's place and take a bunch of their stuff
[728.04 --> 733.46]  everyone's going to be freaked out and you need to address everybody yeah so
[733.46 --> 743.76]  yeah hans von twitchy says the first email was full of pr speak they expected it to leak
[743.76 --> 748.32]  they didn't expect the magnitude of backlash they did want to strong arm the community
[748.32 --> 755.20]  just didn't expect the community to fight back um that's that's my read on it right now i just still
[755.20 --> 759.58]  don't know what the forces at play within nvidia are and this is something that it would be very
[759.58 --> 765.26]  easy for me to drop if i could get someone over there to just talk to me and say look this is what
[765.26 --> 772.64]  happened um i'm not going to go on the record you cannot talk about this i would accept that um but
[772.64 --> 779.52]  you know the person who is boneheaded enough to have thought that that was a good idea you know
[779.52 --> 785.28]  they're not going to they're not going to interact with the media anymore um and or they're too senior
[785.28 --> 790.50]  um you know there's ultimately nothing we can do about it but that's how it went down you know
[790.50 --> 797.08]  whatever whatever it is because the explanation here is guys don't pick up your pitchforks and go
[797.08 --> 803.54]  after bdr i don't actually think and it was my initial reaction my midterm reaction and even now that
[803.54 --> 810.46]  i've done more digging talk to some nvidia partners it is still my reaction that that did not sound like
[810.46 --> 817.90]  something he would write it sounds like something that for whatever reason he had to sign and it
[817.90 --> 826.68]  doesn't make a ton of sense to me um so they apologized to hardware unboxed they have not actually
[826.68 --> 832.48]  addressed the cause of the behavior uh they haven't addressed how they're going to avoid the behavior in
[832.48 --> 838.74]  the future so to me this is a little like um you know a parent uh hitting one of their kids
[838.74 --> 847.26]  coming back and saying hey i'm sorry uh here's some ice cream and an xbox and uh all the other kids are
[847.26 --> 856.90]  like yo what the was that and they're like see you later um you know there's no like hey i was drinking
[856.90 --> 862.12]  and i'm not gonna drink anymore there's no uh yeah you know what i'm sorry you guys
[862.12 --> 867.16]  yeah i'm sorry you guys had to see that it's just um
[867.16 --> 877.66]  yep uh okay bye-bye we're not the same company that brought you geforce partner program um we're
[877.66 --> 885.64]  we're not the same company that literally told 3dfx employees to burn the drivers instead of releasing
[885.64 --> 890.94]  like updated drivers for 3dfx cards no no we're not that company we really we've learned you know
[890.94 --> 898.22]  we're cool now we're good we're nice um you know don't worry about that i i don't know i just uh
[900.70 --> 906.94]  it kind of if i if i have to guess and you know maybe every time i talk about this i am i am poisoning
[906.94 --> 913.10]  the well even further uh with respect to my chances of ever having a good relationship with nvidia again
[913.10 --> 921.34]  um but the only conclusion that i can really draw here is that the toxicity goes up very very high
[924.30 --> 930.62]  yeah that's that's the only real conclusion i can draw like the fact that these things happen
[931.18 --> 941.50]  nvidia treats partners with contempt and nothing ever changes um means that it's just the attitude there
[942.22 --> 948.06]  and i know there are exceptions i know for a fact there are exceptions but maybe this is the kind
[948.06 --> 953.26]  of thing that like at this point i've got nothing left to lose and it just requires a dedicated video
[953.26 --> 960.94]  about it just like look these are all the things that you talk to literally any nvidia partner about
[961.58 --> 967.66]  and they can talk your ear off about the kind of that nvidia puts them through but they're in no
[967.66 --> 975.34]  position to speak out because either it's above their pay grade um or b they would be they would
[975.34 --> 982.86]  be fired or they would negatively impact their company you should go like full you should get like
[982.86 --> 988.14]  an outside not related to the tech industry investigative journalist
[988.14 --> 998.54]  and just like have them host the video and everything that'd be interesting um yeah meat
[998.54 --> 1005.18]  says nvidia screwed aib's hard this gen yeah i mean that's yet another just like i don't even know what
[1005.18 --> 1012.86]  the point is like who benefits i don't think anybody benefited from nvidia giving themselves
[1012.86 --> 1022.14]  such a leg up in terms of board design for the rtx 30 series like why it doesn't benefit consumers
[1022.14 --> 1029.74]  because the vast majority of consumers are going to be buying aib cards not nvidia founders edition cards
[1029.74 --> 1037.10]  it doesn't benefit nvidia because it ends up creating negative pr when there's like launch boards failing it
[1037.10 --> 1043.58]  it doesn't benefit their aibs because they have to either recall or fix boards on their way out to
[1043.58 --> 1050.54]  consumers uh or they have to you know pay a bunch of overtime and you know go into crunch mode for no
[1050.54 --> 1056.46]  reason whatsoever in order to get a good quality product out there in time for launch like it doesn't
[1056.46 --> 1061.66]  benefit consumers did i already say that because they get they have a chance to get broken products for
[1061.66 --> 1071.02]  no reason like what is the point why why why are you doing this why don't you just be cool you know
[1071.90 --> 1075.74]  why don't you just be cool chill out a little bit i don't get it
[1079.34 --> 1086.46]  i don't know anyway why don't we just move on to our next topic because at this point i don't think
[1086.46 --> 1091.66]  they're ever going to address it and i don't think that there's anything i can do to change them
[1092.22 --> 1096.14]  yeah they've they've been in this situation a number of times and they just never say anything
[1096.14 --> 1103.02]  about it yeah or if they do say something it's like sorry we're not going to fundamentally change
[1103.02 --> 1110.86]  anything about our attitude but yeah we're definitely sorry yeah it's um but they're kind of they're kind
[1110.86 --> 1114.30]  of too big to fail in that way too they have so much momentum people are just going to keep buying
[1114.30 --> 1118.38]  their stuff oh of course and they have so much momentum in the enterprise space as well which
[1118.38 --> 1124.38]  tends to have a lot less um reaction to these types of things yep well you consumers don't ever
[1124.38 --> 1132.70]  even end up hearing about it yeah so so why don't we jump right into uh the devotion gog china thing do
[1132.70 --> 1138.70]  you want to run us through what went down here sure yeah cd project red um i i think if you should
[1138.70 --> 1143.98]  should we actually hold on should we do this out of order can you just recap your uh cyberpunk 2077
[1143.98 --> 1151.74]  review first for me dude i told you i i okay so i played for like two hours and it was just it was
[1151.74 --> 1155.50]  just horrible i don't remember the exact amount of time i played for but it wasn't very long and and
[1156.46 --> 1164.30]  honestly probably about half an hour in it was just like morbid curiosity of like is this really this bad
[1164.94 --> 1172.38]  um and they i i don't know my my the the thing that i went over was they took this incredibly uh
[1172.38 --> 1175.98]  uh like sorry i just keep getting absolutely spammed once i
[1180.38 --> 1183.50]  okay i'm back um it's it
[1185.50 --> 1192.06]  there's there's so much life in it in terms of what it looks like yeah the city is beautiful but it is
[1192.06 --> 1199.74]  completely completely lifeless there's there's nothing to it the ai also feels fake the conversations
[1199.74 --> 1207.58]  feel bad the story is not very engaging there's like it's just it and it feels it feels quite a bit
[1208.62 --> 1213.10]  when something is this hyped up even if it was entirely hyped up by the community and not the
[1213.10 --> 1218.06]  company which is not the case but even even if that was it you feel kind of lied to in these scenarios
[1218.06 --> 1228.86]  um so so the biggest the biggest own was probably cyberpunk 2077 being removed from the playstation
[1228.86 --> 1234.86]  store this week uh do you want to run through this or yeah so sony announced late thursday that it would
[1234.86 --> 1241.82]  offer full refunds to people who purchased cyberpunk 2077 and that is uh kind of sort of what i was alluding
[1241.82 --> 1247.18]  to previously the feels like you relied to thing yeah because you see all this footage from the game
[1247.18 --> 1256.14]  and then the footage from the uh the like original ps4 and original xbox versions is if you haven't seen
[1256.14 --> 1262.62]  it it's like actually hilarious it doesn't even remotely look like the same game i don't know if you can
[1262.62 --> 1268.78]  find any of it linus um but it it looks like a literally completely different game like it's
[1268.78 --> 1277.10]  uh the fact that they were okay with selling that to anyone at any level is hilarious um one really
[1277.10 --> 1282.22]  really funny thing that i saw was people pointed out that there's a like collector's edition of the
[1282.22 --> 1289.34]  console and it barely runs on the like cyberpunk 2077 collector's edition version of the console and
[1289.34 --> 1298.62]  it barely runs so that was pretty great um but yeah cyberpunk went or cd project red went from like
[1298.78 --> 1304.22]  the absolute darling of the industry like something that i found interesting for a long time was they
[1304.22 --> 1311.74]  would do these posts um which is something along the lines of like buy buy the witcher or buy cyberpunk
[1311.74 --> 1319.90]  on gog and cd project red gets 100 of the proceeds like because you're you're like funding this tiny indie
[1319.90 --> 1327.66]  company is what it feels like but yeah but they're actually uh a goliath uh yeah they're massive and and
[1327.66 --> 1334.22]  there's all this stuff coming out about like these these like insane crunch times um but then the game
[1334.94 --> 1341.74]  looks horrible on old hardware yeah and it's just not really winning in the reviews department i
[1341.74 --> 1348.94]  haven't even looked this up since last show but i'm gonna look it up right now user score has increased
[1348.94 --> 1355.34]  a little bit the metacritic score or the the reviewer meta score has gone down to 87
[1355.34 --> 1366.06]  um out of 100 the user score has gone up to 7.1 out of 10. sony making the move to allow to to
[1366.06 --> 1372.46]  basically pull it from the store though i i don't think that has this been done before just based on
[1372.46 --> 1379.98]  people feeling so baited on by a game because it's not like it's not like sony has pulled a game for
[1379.98 --> 1387.82]  being bad and that's not really what they're doing here yeah like it's not it's not that bad it's just
[1388.86 --> 1397.02]  not what people expected but especially visually and and like actual gameplay style like there's
[1397.02 --> 1404.78]  there's examples of assets not loading in so you can just like walk through them right because the
[1404.78 --> 1410.06]  asset hasn't actually loaded yet and then you're like glitched in a wall and like or something else
[1410.06 --> 1418.38]  is going on like it's just it's it's basically broken on the old consoles um so yeah i don't know
[1418.38 --> 1424.46]  microsoft is also offering refunds to the game but has not taken it off the store yet um city project
[1424.46 --> 1432.70]  red has posted a few updates apologizing for their situation um yeah the refund from the playstation
[1432.70 --> 1437.50]  store is not automatic you do need to request it and i've heard there are some issues with that
[1437.50 --> 1443.50]  process although i think that happens almost any time a massive massive amount of people request refunds
[1443.50 --> 1450.22]  is the the process of getting that refund comes a little bit clogged um i haven't heard anyone crying
[1450.22 --> 1458.38]  actual foul play there yet just that it gets a little clogged um but yeah it's it's interesting the
[1458.38 --> 1463.26]  game won't be removed from your library if you choose to keep it which is interesting as well
[1465.26 --> 1471.66]  sorry um but yeah i don't think there's a ton else to say there it was it was ripped apparently
[1471.66 --> 1476.62]  digital foundry i haven't seen this actually but it's probably fantastic digital foundry has a video
[1477.58 --> 1484.62]  talking about all of its issues on last gen and like yeah it looks so rough even just like having
[1484.62 --> 1495.58]  skimmed through the yeah 810p 1440 by 810 dynamic resolution like yeah and it's not running at great
[1495.58 --> 1502.30]  frame rates like there's there's some parts of the game that they said were basically unplayable on last
[1502.30 --> 1510.78]  gen consoles just because they were so um they were there was so much motion and the animations were so
[1511.42 --> 1518.54]  stuttery that you just kind of couldn't complete the objective which is pretty which is pretty tough
[1518.54 --> 1524.78]  and sort of raises the question like a you know did cd project red ever like try to play through this game
[1525.42 --> 1532.70]  and b if they didn't then why did they seem like they went out of their way to not show the community
[1532.70 --> 1537.82]  any footage of the game running on those consoles like yeah it's one of those things where i kind of
[1537.82 --> 1542.14]  look at it and i go you know yeah i understand you want to sell as many copies of the game as
[1542.14 --> 1547.58]  possible and you also want to be inclusive to as many people as possible who want to play it not
[1547.58 --> 1553.02]  everybody can afford a playstation 5 or an xbox series and even if they could not everybody can
[1553.02 --> 1556.70]  even get their hands on it right now so yeah you want when you launch your game you want to
[1558.30 --> 1564.62]  you want people to be able to to play it but maybe this is one of those situations where it should
[1564.62 --> 1571.18]  have just been a next gen exclusive slash pc title that simple you know
[1573.50 --> 1579.98]  ah i think even and like maybe i'm wrong here but i think even releasing a thing and like putting a
[1579.98 --> 1584.46]  warning on the store when you buy it um like if you try to buy it you're on one of those old consoles
[1584.46 --> 1590.14]  having a warning that you have to say yes to saying like this is going to run poorly when you buy this
[1590.14 --> 1594.38]  you're getting it on both consoles you should really play it on the new console but you do have
[1594.38 --> 1600.14]  access to it on this one i think that would have alleviated some frustrations and then cd project red
[1600.14 --> 1610.46]  went and made their pr troubles worse let's talk about devotion yeah okay so devotion uh is is like a
[1610.46 --> 1617.74]  horror game as far as i know uh that had some controversial things in it um it has it contains
[1617.74 --> 1625.66]  unflattering references to chinese president did it did in the initial release on steam it did and
[1625.66 --> 1632.86]  some of the backstory there is that this is a taiwanese developer um and it's not just like
[1632.86 --> 1641.58]  the ccp it's not just the chinese communist party that gets upset about um the whole taiwan is it part of
[1641.58 --> 1649.34]  china is it not part of china question um there's actually a lot of just people who live in china
[1649.34 --> 1657.42]  who do not see it from the taiwanese perspective as one way of putting it so there's a lot of
[1657.42 --> 1663.74]  sensitivity around that topic so a taiwanese developer having like you know winnie the pooh
[1663.74 --> 1672.06]  uh memes about you know china's uh direct political statements for sure like they were trying to
[1672.62 --> 1680.54]  aggravate um now with that or not it's just it's that's true uh the developer did say after the
[1680.54 --> 1685.66]  release that uh you know those were placeholder assets and were never meant to be seen in the final
[1685.66 --> 1693.66]  release but uh it wasn't enough to stem the backlash so way back in spring 2019 it was pulled from steam
[1693.66 --> 1700.78]  in all territories for red candle the developer to perform unspecified fixes but then it just like
[1701.58 --> 1708.94]  never returned so now let's fast forward to today what just happened uh gog pulled it off their
[1708.94 --> 1716.94]  platform uh red candle released a or where's gog's statement one second gog announced on twitter that
[1716.94 --> 1723.18]  after receiving many messages from gamers they decided to not list their game in their store
[1723.18 --> 1728.06]  red candle also put out a statement saying that though regretful we are willing to understand and
[1728.06 --> 1734.94]  respect gog's decisions and for and okay so there's a different statement for the players looking
[1734.94 --> 1739.90]  forward to devotions re-release please accept our most sincere apology this is a difficult predicament
[1739.90 --> 1747.58]  to overcome but we won't stop striving so uh red candle games had tweeted earlier this week that the
[1747.58 --> 1754.94]  game would come out on gog on december 18th and the store link has since been pulled it's gone so
[1754.94 --> 1763.74]  there's speculation in the community and by speculation i mean um people are basically pretty sure what's
[1763.74 --> 1770.78]  going on here that this had nothing to do with gamers reaching out to cd project red being upset that
[1770.78 --> 1777.02]  they were going to have the game on their store and it seems like if you go on a platform like twitter
[1777.02 --> 1785.26]  that gamers are pretty much unanimous in their belief that cd project red who owns gog for those
[1785.26 --> 1790.38]  who don't know i don't think we ever actually clarified that that cd project red is just kowtowing
[1790.38 --> 1796.54]  to the chinese government and is refusing to have anything controversial on their platform in order to
[1796.54 --> 1804.70]  keep from running afoul of the ccp however it's important to note that twitter is banned in china
[1805.66 --> 1811.42]  so i was just gonna say yeah that's not the the gamer thing could actually be true
[1813.82 --> 1819.18]  like but it might not be a demographic that you're gonna see on on twitter exactly so it might be
[1819.18 --> 1824.14]  something where you just don't have exposure to the gamers who are upset about this it could be
[1824.70 --> 1831.02]  chinese gamers now that's not to say that you shouldn't still be outraged at everyone whether
[1831.02 --> 1838.62]  it's cd project red or valve or epic games or anyone for not allowing this game on their store because at
[1838.62 --> 1846.38]  the end of the day um there's a couple of questions here right like there's uh there's what do gamers
[1846.38 --> 1853.50]  think of it and then there's just you know what's more important um being free to criticize the
[1853.50 --> 1860.54]  government or not being free to criticize the government um and yes these are private platforms
[1860.54 --> 1865.66]  there it's not in a private space and if you want to talk about like american first amendment rights to
[1866.22 --> 1872.94]  to free speech they only really apply to public forums uh public areas of discussion
[1872.94 --> 1879.26]  um and and being critical of the government it doesn't apply in private places and it doesn't
[1879.26 --> 1887.34]  apply to criticizing private businesses but it's still supposed to be a guiding principle and it's
[1887.34 --> 1894.22]  something that people are still understandably extremely upset with cd project red for not
[1894.22 --> 1903.42]  standing up for even if it was actual customers who were angry that they were allowing this type of
[1903.42 --> 1911.50]  political speech which isn't even apparently in the game anymore they're just they don't want to hear
[1911.50 --> 1916.38]  from this developer ever again because they have the audacity to say something negative about the chinese
[1916.38 --> 1926.06]  government um there are still um there are still games from from red candle games available on steam
[1926.06 --> 1931.98]  i'm not 100 certain about gog i could check um so like as a developer they haven't been entirely axed
[1931.98 --> 1942.46]  yet um but this game in particular is not being allowed to see light it's fascinating to me to have so much
[1942.46 --> 1951.90]  um so much sort of nationalistic pride that the mere fact that a game criticizes you know the leader of
[1951.90 --> 1962.62]  my country makes me like enraged like uh i don't i don't get it maybe this is just like a canadian thing
[1962.62 --> 1969.50]  like i don't have like any kind of personal if someone's like yeah justin trudeau he's he's dumb or bad
[1969.50 --> 1979.34]  i'm like okay like okay that's all right that's your that's your opinion um you know like yeah it's
[1979.34 --> 1985.82]  a very different depending on the context i might even agree with you uh it depends what we're talking
[1985.82 --> 1993.74]  about uh that's been that's been widely accepted here for a long time um like there there were there
[1993.74 --> 2000.62]  were games i remember on like addictinggames.com yeah that like we're making fun of american presidents
[2001.26 --> 2009.42]  um and it's like yeah so so what and just no one no one cared at all um but so it's strongly different
[2009.42 --> 2019.34]  mentality um it's hard to speak for a place that we've spent extremely little time in and and know not
[2019.34 --> 2025.50]  enough about sorry see people seem to be seem people seem to be under the impression that i am
[2025.50 --> 2034.06]  somehow siding with the ccp right now what what sometimes i just i i look at the comments on this
[2034.06 --> 2041.26]  show and i go what what alternate youtube window did you have open while you were commenting on my video
[2041.26 --> 2049.90]  you know is there anything that i've said that sounds anything like cd project red was right to
[2049.90 --> 2055.66]  pull this game all i was saying is that there's there there could be legitimacy around it being
[2056.22 --> 2063.42]  users that are pointing it out yes that it's just it's it's probably users from a very specific area
[2063.42 --> 2071.18]  users from a very specific area that have very limited access to alternate views um access
[2071.18 --> 2076.54]  users from a very specific area that have access to censored media um and so you know i i get it
[2077.74 --> 2083.90]  not i get it i i see it i just i have a very difficult time putting me in that putting myself in that
[2083.90 --> 2093.26]  kind of headspace to to think that you know somehow uh an attack on you know the leader's appearance of
[2093.26 --> 2101.10]  my country is like this like personal attack on me as a person uh i i don't understand it it's bizarre to
[2101.10 --> 2108.62]  me i i've always kind of had the view of like if if it's a very respectful leader they shouldn't
[2108.62 --> 2114.22]  care about something that petty and unimportant anyways um hans von twitchy says usa and canada
[2114.22 --> 2119.98]  are used to low quality political leaders china singapore etc are proud of their high quality very
[2119.98 --> 2127.10]  capable genuinely helping the country leaders yeah it's okay though at the end it's in parentheses
[2127.10 --> 2135.90]  that's their mindset um you know so is north korea that doesn't make it right and that doesn't make
[2135.90 --> 2147.10]  it accurate it just it's something um right yeah um so anyway it's we could do a weird poll it's a bad
[2147.10 --> 2154.30]  it's a bad look it's a bad look for cd project red and while i recognize that the feedback may have
[2154.30 --> 2162.86]  actually been from gamers um i think some things are a bigger deal than what some gamers within a
[2162.86 --> 2169.50]  given demographic thinks should we see what the community thinks uh we can i i don't think it's
[2169.50 --> 2176.86]  going to be any kind of surprise yeah i yeah i don't even yeah i don't even i don't even think there's
[2176.86 --> 2183.74]  any point i think it's going to be 99 cd project red did the wrong thing and one percent uh people
[2183.74 --> 2188.06]  using a firewall right now okay i got a better one yeah we should ask the community what they
[2188.06 --> 2194.70]  what they think about cd project red now or we can even maybe include a change like did you dislike
[2194.70 --> 2199.98]  them before and you dislike them now did you dislike them before and you like them now did you like them
[2199.98 --> 2205.42]  before but you dislike them now did you like them before and do you still like them now i i don't even i
[2205.42 --> 2214.54]  i don't even understand the point of this poll like uh okay there here's your here's your poll that
[2214.54 --> 2224.30]  you insist on have having okay your opinion of cd project red has improved or gotten worse all right
[2224.30 --> 2230.62]  are you happy create poll i just think it's interesting like like with the with the release of
[2230.62 --> 2234.86]  cyberpunk and with these changes and stuff like has your has your mind share of cd project red changed i
[2234.86 --> 2239.26]  don't think it's interesting at all i think it's obvious but there you go all right i spammed it in
[2239.26 --> 2243.82]  the youtube chat no no you know what luke no you you can have your poll you can have your poll i'm
[2243.82 --> 2248.70]  putting it in the flow plane chat right now i'm hitting twitch with it there you go there's your poll luke
[2248.70 --> 2255.50]  there's your poll if it's unchanged just don't answer the poll all right there you go here's your results
[2256.22 --> 2265.58]  uh display capture your opinion of cd project red has okay yeah basically gotten worse and a big
[2265.58 --> 2272.70]  surprise to nobody all right only other answer i saw coming up there yeah that's fair that's fair
[2274.78 --> 2282.78]  microsoft is allegedly working on arm processors pretty big news right
[2282.78 --> 2291.82]  yeah uh this is also not in the doc but i just thought it was really interesting now this is
[2291.82 --> 2298.54]  supposed to be happening apparently or is rumored to be happening um bloomberg reported is it a rumor
[2298.54 --> 2304.78]  or is it real i'm not sure if we know they say it's happening is using arm limited designs to produce
[2304.78 --> 2310.46]  the process that will be used in its data centers yeah okay so it's apparently ah see they say this is
[2310.46 --> 2319.26]  happening but i don't know that this is actually uh confirmed you guys will have to let me know i
[2319.26 --> 2324.62]  don't actually have any notes because this is something i wanted to add solely because i wanted
[2324.62 --> 2330.86]  to make the joke that we're gonna have to change it to micro hard if they actually make their own
[2330.86 --> 2338.62]  processors uh instead of microsoft yeah and yeah my micro hard you know it's gonna be uh it's exciting you
[2338.62 --> 2344.70]  know what i mean it's exciting for microsoft micro hard excuse me to uh to take on apple directly
[2344.70 --> 2350.94]  this way so the more solid reporting is that they're working on this for the data center so this
[2350.94 --> 2359.42]  would be like a competitor for amazon's graviton processors and then the more um wishy-washy report
[2359.42 --> 2367.10]  is that these could in the future end up in a direct competitor to the macbook air in the form of something like a
[2367.10 --> 2374.30]  surface product where microsoft is trying to to to take on apple head to head with a deeper level
[2374.30 --> 2381.74]  of integration between the software and the hardware would be like micro firm you know soft it's soft and
[2381.74 --> 2388.30]  hard it does say here the the chip the the company's chip design unit responds to jason zander head of
[2388.30 --> 2393.98]  the azure cloud business so yeah that would make sense it would be a lot more uh like data center server
[2393.98 --> 2401.82]  focused yeah i'm excited i'm excited uh also excited about uh remembering to do sponsor spots
[2401.82 --> 2408.38]  right now before i just unexpectedly randomly uh suddenly have to duck out at about 6 30 because

[2549.98 --> 2555.42]  couple of other things we said we were going to talk about on the show uh do we want to go through the
[2555.42 --> 2561.50]  solar winds orion software hacked i don't think we technically uh announced that in our four topics
[2561.50 --> 2566.70]  but we can oh no we don't have to do that then what did we talk about for our antitrust all right
[2566.70 --> 2574.46]  sure yeah what else is new hit me um 10 state attorney generals have accused uh google of illegally
[2574.46 --> 2580.70]  abusing its monopoly over uh essentially ad delivery online a lot of their points are based around
[2580.70 --> 2585.26]  uh the fact that google essentially owns like the whole pipeline like the whole ad buying process
[2585.26 --> 2590.38]  is owned by google that they've been buying up companies in the space uh doing a lot of anti
[2590.38 --> 2596.86]  competitive things uh in october the justice department and 11 states said google had illegally
[2596.86 --> 2603.34]  maintained a monopoly over online search engines and the ads that appear in users results and last week
[2603.34 --> 2611.18]  the ftc and 40 plus states accused facebook of illegally crushing competition by acquiring younger rivals
[2611.18 --> 2616.54]  which has like been their entire business model for a while yep um and argued that the company should
[2616.54 --> 2623.50]  be broken up in 2007 this was actually huge google bought double click which offered advertising
[2623.50 --> 2630.14]  technology and acted as a marketplace in a deal that has since been criticized as central to google's
[2630.14 --> 2638.14]  dominance abso freaking lootly yep um google now controls software at every stop of the ad sales process
[2638.14 --> 2643.02]  which is which is which is what i was talking about earlier um it's it's it's interesting this is
[2643.02 --> 2646.94]  something i believe we've talked about on wanshow quite a few times which is that like america
[2646.94 --> 2652.38]  hasn't really been using their antitrust laws in ways that they used to in the past or in ways that
[2652.94 --> 2660.30]  seem to be the way that they should be using them yeah it's interesting to see america kind of flexing
[2660.30 --> 2670.54]  those laws again um but yeah um interesting google claims it competes with a vast array of rivals so i
[2670.54 --> 2676.94]  guess yeah we'll we'll see we'll see how this plays out i mean honestly i would love to see more antitrust
[2676.94 --> 2686.22]  uh honestly the entire fang is that how you pronounce it facebook apple uh amazon netflix and google i i'd like
[2686.22 --> 2692.78]  to see all of them held to a higher standard than they have been over the last i'd say 10 to 15 years
[2693.98 --> 2700.78]  we'll see how it goes though well i i the the fang thing is is definitely interesting to bring up it's
[2700.78 --> 2705.82]  i i think people mostly like that acronym because it sounds cool and i use it too because it is cool
[2707.02 --> 2712.54]  but it like leaves some things out that should probably be there and it includes like netflix which
[2712.54 --> 2718.38]  while they're awesome and gigantic they i don't think they necessarily represent the same types
[2718.38 --> 2724.94]  of actions as some of the other companies in there um but that's fair yeah it's that's that's pretty
[2724.94 --> 2733.10]  fair if anything netflix is a less advantaged player in their space yeah yeah i'm sure if they were more
[2733.10 --> 2738.22]  advantaged they would be doing the same things um the the the the two companies also known as google and
[2738.22 --> 2746.22]  facebook accounted for 54 percent of us digital advertising in 2019 with google share at 31 and
[2746.22 --> 2753.50]  facebook's share at 23 that is massive freaking crazy we'll see if facebook loses some of that share
[2753.50 --> 2759.98]  though apple is rolling out that update to ios 14 that is going to make it much harder for facebook to
[2759.98 --> 2767.50]  track users on ios devices and basically the two are kind of sparring right now with facebook saying this
[2767.50 --> 2773.34]  is a bad thing this is going to affect and this is going to affect advertisers ability to get better
[2773.34 --> 2779.98]  better cpms and more relevant ads to your face holes and apple says well people are more than welcome to
[2779.98 --> 2789.26]  have the most relevant ads to their face holes they just have to opt into it now so yeah i'm with apple on
[2789.26 --> 2798.54]  this one personally i mean it's also great for me because all of our digital advertising is around you
[2798.54 --> 2805.66]  know uh building an audience that we kind of know what you guys are into and then talking to you directly
[2805.66 --> 2812.06]  about that stuff instead of doing it in like a scummy you know listening to your microphone on your phone
[2812.06 --> 2819.82]  way um so yeah i i love it if we could have a return to people just watching the content that they
[2819.82 --> 2827.74]  watch and getting served you know ads or or sponsors or whatever that's relevant to that it seems like
[2827.74 --> 2835.90]  a good step backwards to me and i think that's pretty much it oh yeah speaking of which lttstore.com
[2835.90 --> 2841.26]  we've actually got nothing to really call out this week other than to say thank you guys very much for
[2841.26 --> 2849.90]  your support we sold through almost all 17 000 mouse pads that we ordered i thought 17 000 mouse pads was
[2849.90 --> 2855.74]  a lot i thought it was crazy there's only a couple of sizes left so if you guys want to get one they're
[2855.74 --> 2863.18]  there but not for long um we have more coming but probably not until late february to mid-march
[2863.18 --> 2867.66]  yeah sometime in that time frame the good news though is that stealth hottie stealth hotties stealth
[2867.66 --> 2872.46]  hoodies are restocked water bottles are restocked in all colors and we have a bunch of graphic keys
[2872.46 --> 2878.06]  back in stock we've still got lots of toques uh we've still got lots of cpu pillows and tons of board
[2878.06 --> 2884.62]  books i wish we had user reviews for the board books because uh all of the feedback i've seen about
[2884.62 --> 2889.66]  it so far has been incredible i just wish there was another place where i could just go sit and get my
[2889.66 --> 2894.22]  ego boost from reading people's comments on the board book i've even had people sending me pictures
[2894.22 --> 2901.26]  uh like tagging me on twitter with like them reading it to their baby and stuff as just as someone for
[2901.26 --> 2907.82]  whom child literacy is such a big deal it's just heartwarming for me to see people just it doesn't
[2907.82 --> 2912.94]  matter what it's about like that's the biggest lesson when it comes to when it comes to child literacy
[2912.94 --> 2921.90]  it doesn't matter what your kids reading just make sure they're reading if it's like a pokemon uh
[2922.62 --> 2927.90]  what's that stupid pokemon book that uh our eldest used to just sit and read for hours on end
[2929.50 --> 2934.78]  i don't i don't remember it was like basically like a creaturepedia of like pokemon it's like it's
[2934.78 --> 2940.46]  not it's not this is not intellectual reading material by any stretch of the imagination but for me
[2940.46 --> 2946.22]  it was just exciting to see him with his nose buried in a book for hours on end because that's
[2946.22 --> 2950.94]  the building block that's foundational yeah they can go somewhere from there pretty easily at least
[2950.94 --> 2957.42]  they're learning the process of reading and whatnot exactly exactly so it's really exciting to me honestly
[2957.42 --> 2965.42]  i've had people both internally and externally ask me you know like when's the when's the abcs of
[2965.42 --> 2970.70]  computers you know like because we already did abcs of gaming and i'm kind of looking for a new
[2970.70 --> 2975.98]  challenge i wouldn't mind doing something that's more like story driven but i haven't i haven't really
[2975.98 --> 2981.42]  i haven't really decided yet so you could choose your own adventure game and choose your book sorry no
[2982.22 --> 2990.38]  not like that um something more like uh like with actual characters and you know like the computer
[2990.38 --> 2996.86]  family or something gamer family i don't like i don't know what it would be but where it has it has
[2996.86 --> 3003.50]  you know life lessons but sort of more related to gaming and technology um you know how like you know
[3003.50 --> 3009.18]  bernstein bears will have like a fun like it tells a story but there's there's always like a lesson you
[3009.18 --> 3015.42]  know like be don't don't judge people based on their appearances so you can even have a lesson that's just like
[3016.14 --> 3022.14]  don't pre-order things obviously you'd want to frame it more no i'm serious though you'd want to frame it
[3023.10 --> 3029.26]  yeah you'd want to frame it more in like a like a kid sort of friendly way like um you know you could
[3029.26 --> 3034.06]  have a lesson about you could have a lesson about like loot boxes as well so they could go and they
[3034.06 --> 3039.50]  could learn that if they waste all their allowance money on this they're gonna end up disappointed when
[3039.50 --> 3045.74]  what they could have done is they could have just bought something that made them that they knew was
[3045.74 --> 3050.22]  going to make them happy in the first place instead of gambling like so having like anti-gambling
[3050.22 --> 3058.14]  messaging um just like sort of pro-consumer jealousy too because like if they got too jealous and wanted
[3058.14 --> 3063.26]  to buy some cosmetic box in a game they don't even get the thing that they wanted and then they can't
[3063.26 --> 3066.86]  play with their friends because their friends are all playing this other game but they can't afford to buy
[3066.86 --> 3073.02]  it exactly exactly that's cool yeah so that'd be pretty neat um i've got like two soup i've got
[3073.02 --> 3078.70]  time for like two super chats um ilia you sent like three of them so i'll respond to one of yours
[3079.26 --> 3083.82]  yes we're going to include the thx pandas in the review of the air the review of the airpods max yes

[3096.14 --> 3102.62]  sending that over um uh uh melody says dualshock has been doing reliable low latency bluetooth since
[3102.62 --> 3111.98]  2006. um define low latency like it's i guarantee you it's not like sub one millisecond latency so if
[3111.98 --> 3118.38]  you want to talk about like bluetooth audio and performance being you know not low latency enough
[3118.38 --> 3126.70]  yeah it's a different that's a different game uh thanks christian isaac uh thanks andy boy

[3161.26 --> 3168.06]  brenstain it's s-t-a-i-n i thought it was bernstein for years but that is actually not how it's spelled i
[3168.06 --> 3174.06]  know nobody says it like that but it i don't make the rules all right see you later i wonder where it
[3174.06 --> 3182.06]  started it just looks like that i don't know
[3182.06 --> 3201.10]  oh sorry float plane uh yeah there is one actually we did hear back from the dell insider they said
[3201.10 --> 3205.42]  they can provide all the proof that i asked for i actually emailed them back today i've been a little
[3205.42 --> 3211.66]  slow on my emails lately but i emailed them back today asking for all of that and uh invited them to join the
[3211.66 --> 3217.58]  show at some point in the future if they if everything checks out cool yeah i am uh based
[3217.58 --> 3224.30]  on their allegations uh it's not a good look for dell are they wanting the anonymity would you have to
[3224.30 --> 3229.42]  like voice changer them or something i don't know how to handle it because yes they uh do they are
[3229.42 --> 3235.18]  requesting anonymity so we'll see how that works be cool to do like an old news network thing where you
[3235.18 --> 3240.62]  put like like a fake shadow in front of them yeah yeah and then like voice change of them that'd be cool
[3240.62 --> 3244.06]  cool we'll see we'll see we'll see and
