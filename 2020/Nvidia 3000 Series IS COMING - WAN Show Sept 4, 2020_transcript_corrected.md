[0.00 → 3.00] But I sound like a fricking...
[5.00 → 9.00] Excellent connection. I think we might be live on YouTube.
[9.00 → 14.00] Give us a second. Checking really quick.
[14.00 → 17.00] I'm trying to relax, guys. I'm sorry.
[17.00 → 21.00] Chill out, bro! Calm down!
[21.00 → 26.00] I don't know how to tell if we're live on YouTube.
[26.00 → 30.00] We're live on YouTube. I think, maybe? Yes, we are.
[30.00 → 32.00] Okay. Hello. Welcome to the show.
[32.00 → 34.00] We are live on YouTube.
[34.00 → 36.00] Yeah. That took us a moment.
[36.00 → 39.00] We have fantastic news this week.
[39.00 → 42.00] Mostly, we're probably going to spend a pretty significant part of the show
[42.00 → 46.00] talking about the new NVIDIA 3000 series announcement.
[46.00 → 51.00] We've been talking about the rumours for this for what feels like 10,000 years.
[51.00 → 53.00] And it's finally freaking here.
[53.00 → 57.00] There's some good news. There are some things I'm going to complain about
[57.00 → 59.00] because I complain about things.
[59.00 → 60.00] Oh, really?
[60.00 → 62.00] And we'll go from there.
[62.00 → 63.00] Oh, dang.
[63.00 → 68.00] Also, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 2 apparently looks fantastic.
[68.00 → 70.00] We'll dive more into that later.
[70.00 → 71.00] Riley, got anything?
[71.00 → 72.00] Great.
[72.00 → 76.00] And the Intel also took the wraps off their Tiger Lake...
[76.00 → 79.00] What's it called? 11th Gen Mobile this week.
[79.00 → 81.00] So we can probably talk about that.
[81.00 → 82.00] Yes.
[82.00 → 85.00] And happy 35th anniversary to Nintendo.
[85.00 → 86.00] So...
[86.00 → 87.00] Hooray!
[87.00 → 89.00] They often do fun stuff around their anniversary.
[89.00 → 90.00] So that's cool.
[90.00 → 93.00] Super Mario Bros. 35 Battle Royale.
[93.00 → 94.00] Okay.
[94.00 → 95.00] Fantastic.
[95.00 → 96.00] Yeah, man.
[96.00 → 97.00] Anyway, intro time!
[97.00 → 98.00] I'm most excited.
[98.00 → 99.00] Do it!
[99.00 → 100.00] Hit it!
[100.00 → 101.00] It did work.
[101.00 → 102.00] That's always the benchmark.
[102.00 → 103.00] It's the...
[103.00 → 105.00] I can't see what your...
[105.00 → 106.00] I can't see your screen.
[106.00 → 107.00] I can't see your screen.
[107.00 → 112.00] You can always bring up a version of the show.
[112.00 → 113.00] That's a good job.
[113.00 → 114.00] I've done that.
[114.00 → 115.00] I guess so.
[115.00 → 116.00] Last time we went together, I was...
[116.00 → 117.00] I was...
[117.00 → 118.00] I was...
[118.00 → 119.00] I was...
[119.00 → 120.00] I was...
[120.00 → 121.00] I was...
[121.00 → 122.00] I was...
[122.00 → 123.00] I was...
[123.00 → 124.00] I was...
[124.00 → 125.00] I was...
[125.00 → 126.00] I was...
[126.00 → 127.00] I was...
[127.00 → 128.00] Nerd or Die.
[128.00 → 130.00] And Ridge Wallet.
[130.00 → 132.00] Pew, pew, pew.
[132.00 → 133.00] Pew.
[133.00 → 134.00] Okay.
[134.00 → 135.00] Love all those guys.
[135.00 → 136.00] Here we go.
[136.00 → 137.00] We're back.
[137.00 → 140.00] Back at you to talk about all things Ampere.
[140.00 → 145.00] So I'm gonna fire through a lot of the general notes here pretty quick.
[145.00 → 149.00] And then we can dive into deliberation between the two of us.
[149.00 → 154.00] Unless you've been living under a rock and like seriously, if you're in the tech community, I think that's rather true.
[154.00 → 159.00] You've probably heard about the announcement from Nvidia of their new lineup of desktop GPUs.
[159.00 → 161.00] The 3080 will be coming September 17th.
[161.00 → 163.00] That's like right around the corner.
[163.00 → 165.00] 3090 September 24th.
[165.00 → 169.00] And the 3070 will be coming in October.
[169.00 → 175.00] It's built on what NVIDIA is calling a Samsung 8nm node called 8n.
[175.00 → 181.00] There are a few things in here that I'm like, I'm actually quite genuinely appreciative that they didn't get too creative with the names.
[181.00 → 182.00] Because it's pretty straightforward.
[182.00 → 193.00] The 3080 and 3090 have Micron's new superfast GDDR6X memory that can transfer twice as much data per clock.
[193.00 → 197.00] Thanks to a coding format called PAM4.
[197.00 → 205.00] Previous GDDR specs used traditional binary for data transmission for two bits per cycle.
[205.00 → 209.00] While PAM4, again, thanks for not being way too creative.
[209.00 → 210.00] I actually appreciate it.
[210.00 → 212.00] Consent 4.
[212.00 → 216.00] All cores have seen a big boost in performance, which is fantastic.
[216.00 → 224.00] NVIDIA claims shaders and tensor cores improved by 2.7-fold and ray tracing cores by up to 1.7-fold.
[224.00 → 227.00] A bunch of new technologies were also launched, namely NVIDIA Reflex.
[227.00 → 239.00] This sounds super cool, which promises to greatly reduce system latency as well as allow end users to visualize input latency all the way through the chain from click to output.
[239.00 → 240.00] That is very cool.
[240.00 → 253.00] NVIDIA Broadcast, an AI powered voice and video broadcasting app that applies effects on camera and microphone inputs and exposes virtual outputs for OBS and other streaming applications.
[253.00 → 260.00] NVIDIA Omni sense Machining, which provides a whole new host of tools to create.
[260.00 → 263.00] You're just going through these like crazy, eh man?
[263.00 → 266.00] The notes on this are like a page and a half long.
[266.00 → 267.00] Well, there's a lot.
[267.00 → 268.00] Yeah, there's a lot to talk about for sure.
[268.00 → 269.00] So I'm trying to get us through.
[269.00 → 270.00] Keep going.
[270.00 → 275.00] Omni sense Machining, which provides a whole host of new tools to create more game engine videos.
[275.00 → 276.00] Cool.
[276.00 → 282.00] RTX IO, which allows direct access to high-speed storage by the GPU with hardware,
[282.00 → 287.00] with hardware accelerated decompression similar to the way that the PS5 works.
[287.00 → 288.00] Minor shots fired.
[288.00 → 290.00] Now, individual specs.
[290.00 → 298.00] The 3090, this is supposed to kind of be a replacement for the Titan, though they did call it a 3090.
[298.00 → 303.00] The 90 moniker has always been kind of reserved for somewhat special cards.
[303.00 → 305.00] I don't know if they're recycling Titan, but we'll get more into that.
[305.00 → 311.00] It has 10,496 CUBA cores, which is actually just kind of absurd.
[311.00 → 326.00] It also has 24 gigabytes of that GDDR6X memory that we mentioned earlier, clocking in at 19.5 gigabits per second, resulting at 939 gigabytes per second of maximum bandwidth.
[326.00 → 327.00] Wow.
[327.00 → 328.00] Which is nuts.
[328.00 → 329.00] 8K.
[329.00 → 330.00] Yeah.
[330.00 → 332.00] You can do 8K gaming.
[332.00 → 334.00] With a bunch of settings on, like RTX.
[334.00 → 335.00] 60 FPS.
[335.00 → 336.00] That's messed up.
[336.00 → 337.00] That's messed up.
[337.00 → 339.00] That's not, it's unnatural.
[339.00 → 340.00] It's illegal.
[340.00 → 342.00] It was not allowed.
[342.00 → 344.00] I didn't think we would get there.
[344.00 → 345.00] Okay, keep going.
[345.00 → 346.00] Hey, don't let me-
[346.00 → 347.00] Like, ever?
[347.00 → 350.00] You didn't think we were going to get there ever?
[350.00 → 353.00] Oh, well, not in my lifetime.
[353.00 → 354.00] No, I don't know.
[354.00 → 360.00] I mean, like, I feel like we only just got to 4K gaming really like at what, four, three years ago?
[360.00 → 361.00] Two years ago?
[361.00 → 362.00] Three, four years ago?
[362.00 → 363.00] On the line even.
[363.00 → 364.00] A lot of the top-end cards had issues.
[364.00 → 366.00] The last few years, let's say that.
[366.00 → 367.00] Yeah, for sure.
[367.00 → 369.00] And now we're at 8K.
[369.00 → 381.00] That card is going to retail for $1,499, which like, hurts my soul, the fact that some people that are going to play League of Legends are going to go buy that graphics card.
[381.00 → 388.00] But I don't think the majority of people should be aiming for that card.
[388.00 → 391.00] The more spicy cards are what's coming down the line.
[391.00 → 397.00] The 3080, 700 US dollars, 8,704 CUBA cores.
[397.00 → 398.00] Absurd.
[398.00 → 403.00] The RTX 2080 only had about a third of that at 2944 CUBA cores.
[403.00 → 409.00] It has 10 gigabytes of GDDR6X memory across a 320-bit bus.
[409.00 → 412.00] Maximum bandwidth of 790 gigabytes per second.
[412.00 → 413.00] For context-
[413.00 → 414.00] 60.
[414.00 → 415.00] Oh, right.
[415.00 → 416.00] 760, sorry.
[416.00 → 417.00] That's why I'm here.
[417.00 → 419.00] Slightly dyslexia on that one.
[419.00 → 424.00] For context, the 2080 Ti does 616 gigabytes per second.
[424.00 → 426.00] The Titan does 672.
[426.00 → 437.00] Nvidia claims the 380 will double the 2080s performance, placing it well above the performance level of an RTX 2080 Ti at half the price.
[437.00 → 438.00] That's just rude.
[438.00 → 444.00] Although, we're going to talk about that in a second too, because the prices of those cards have been very interesting over the last little bit.
[444.00 → 445.00] Right, yeah.
[445.00 → 446.00] Well, now it's not even...
[446.00 → 449.00] Actually, let's talk about that now.
[449.00 → 450.00] Now you can get like 2080.
[450.00 → 451.00] Yeah, why not?
[451.00 → 452.00] There's...
[452.00 → 453.00] I mean...
[453.00 → 454.00] Oh, yeah.
[454.00 → 455.00] I don't know.
[455.00 → 460.00] I saw some 2080 Ti's going on eBay or whatever for like 300 bucks.
[460.00 → 461.00] 300 bucks.
[461.00 → 462.00] I think.
[462.00 → 463.00] That's interesting.
[463.00 → 465.00] It might have been 2080 Super.
[465.00 → 466.00] I'm not sure.
[466.00 → 467.00] This is...
[467.00 → 475.00] So, this is why Linus every once in a while talks about like when he would exchange cards.
[475.00 → 479.00] We talk about the buying and selling that we both used to do a lot more when we were younger.
[479.00 → 484.00] And one of the strategies was to sell your card before the announcement.
[484.00 → 490.00] And I think this is the strongest reason why like ever.
[490.00 → 491.00] Yeah.
[491.00 → 501.00] Because if you sold your 2080 Ti before this announcement, you probably would have gotten like around or a little bit higher than $1,000.
[501.00 → 505.00] And now you're going to get around $300.
[505.00 → 506.00] It's wild.
[506.00 → 507.00] I mean, and I'm...
[507.00 → 508.00] I, you know, I didn't...
[508.00 → 517.00] I'm not quite in that exact position, but we just did this Intel upgrade thing and I got a 2080 Super as part of it.
[517.00 → 519.00] And I was really happy about it.
[519.00 → 520.00] I was like, sweet.
[520.00 → 521.00] I had like a...
[521.00 → 522.00] I had a...
[522.00 → 524.00] I was running a 970 before that.
[524.00 → 525.00] GTX 970.
[525.00 → 527.00] So, like 2080 Super is a huge step-up.
[527.00 → 528.00] I got an ultra-wide monitor.
[528.00 → 530.00] 3440 by 1440.
[530.00 → 531.00] I was like so excited.
[531.00 → 532.00] And it's...
[532.00 → 533.00] You should still be excited.
[533.00 → 534.00] It's...
[534.00 → 535.00] Yeah.
[535.00 → 536.00] I am excited.
[536.00 → 537.00] It'll be...
[537.00 → 540.00] It'll be fine still, but like, you know, I...
[540.00 → 541.00] Having...
[541.00 → 546.00] This is the first time that I've really had a high-end part right when something launched.
[546.00 → 547.00] Yeah.
[547.00 → 548.00] And it doesn't feel great.
[548.00 → 549.00] That's...
[549.00 → 550.00] I mean...
[550.00 → 552.00] First world problems, but like, Geez.
[552.00 → 553.00] All right.
[553.00 → 554.00] This...
[554.00 → 556.00] This free graphics card is really just bugging me, man.
[556.00 → 557.00] I just...
[557.00 → 558.00] I can't handle it.
[558.00 → 559.00] I know.
[559.00 → 560.00] Well, there was a budget.
[560.00 → 561.00] It wasn't free enough.
[561.00 → 564.00] I mean, I just mean if we did my video like a month later, I could have had a...
[564.00 → 565.00] I could have had the new card.
[565.00 → 566.00] Mmm.
[566.00 → 570.00] So, I think I was like, oh, I'm lucky to get the early one, but...
[570.00 → 571.00] Is there...
[571.00 → 572.00] Is there anyone down the line from you?
[572.00 → 573.00] Who's next?
[573.00 → 574.00] Yeah.
[574.00 → 576.00] Oh, I forget who's next.
[576.00 → 577.00] They should make them do it.
[577.00 → 581.00] They should make them do it on like September 14th.
[581.00 → 582.00] Yeah.
[582.00 → 583.00] Right.
[583.00 → 584.00] Because when...
[584.00 → 585.00] What's the dates?
[585.00 → 586.00] They're all...
[586.00 → 587.00] They all come into different dates.
[587.00 → 588.00] Yeah.
[588.00 → 589.00] September 17th to the 3080.
[589.00 → 590.00] Yeah.
[590.00 → 591.00] The 24th to the 3090.
[591.00 → 592.00] October for the 3070.
[592.00 → 594.00] They should make them do it.
[594.00 → 595.00] Yeah.
[595.00 → 596.00] One thing that I wanted to...
[596.00 → 597.00] Wednesday.
[597.00 → 598.00] Wednesday video release on the 16th.
[598.00 → 600.00] That'd be funny.
[600.00 → 601.00] Ridiculous.
[601.00 → 606.00] One thing that I did want to bring up is the fact that these CUBA cores, you know, we're
[606.00 → 609.00] making a big deal about how they're like, oh, it's more than twice the amount of CUBA
[609.00 → 611.00] cores for some of them or whatever.
[611.00 → 614.00] But I saw a thing, and I'm completely unqualified to talk about this.
[614.00 → 616.00] So, maybe people in the chat, I don't know.
[616.00 → 618.00] Or maybe you do.
[618.00 → 620.00] The cores aren't like exactly the same.
[620.00 → 621.00] Like they're not like...
[621.00 → 624.00] They don't map one to one in terms of performance.
[624.00 → 626.00] Do you know anything about that?
[626.00 → 627.00] I don't think.
[627.00 → 628.00] Sure.
[628.00 → 629.00] Let's check it out.
[629.00 → 630.00] Sorry about the bird.
[630.00 → 632.00] I don't know how loud that's coming through.
[632.00 → 638.00] I'm just reading off of a Reddit post by you, la la la Philip.
[638.00 → 641.00] You got a bird in there, dude.
[641.00 → 642.00] I do.
[642.00 → 643.00] I do.
[643.00 → 644.00] Sorry if it's coming through loud.
[644.00 → 650.00] He came over, and he like sat on this perch that's on my desk and I reached my arm up
[650.00 → 653.00] so that he could like jump on my arm so I could show the show.
[653.00 → 660.00] But I'm wearing these fancy new LTT edition sweatbands, and I think he was like, what the heck?
[660.00 → 662.00] And just took off.
[662.00 → 664.00] I'm wearing them too.
[664.00 → 665.00] Oh my.
[665.00 → 669.00] Getting dressed on Sancho.
[669.00 → 671.00] By our powers combined.
[671.00 → 674.00] Anyway, that's for later.
[674.00 → 681.00] So what is the la la la Philip on the red hardware Subreddit.
[681.00 → 684.00] I just saw this during my like news-gathering.
[684.00 → 693.00] He's like entering invoke and Volta each SM sub core can execute 132 wide bundle of instructions per clock.
[693.00 → 704.00] However, it can only complete 16 FB 32 operations per clock, but ampere has moved back to executing 32 FB 32 operations per SM sub core per clock.
[704.00 → 705.00] Okay.
[705.00 → 711.00] So if you are in the chat, and you know anything about what I just said, that's a good point.
[711.00 → 713.00] I have no idea what I just said.
[713.00 → 721.00] I think something to tie into that, and I'm going to I'm going to actually just quickly fire through the 3070 notes, and then I'll jump into this more.
[721.00 → 722.00] But yeah.
[722.00 → 723.00] Okay.
[723.00 → 725.00] So just hold that thought for a second.
[725.00 → 726.00] The 3070.
[726.00 → 730.00] It should have 2080 Ti levels of performance for 500 bucks.
[730.00 → 733.00] It'll have 5888 CUBA course.
[733.00 → 739.00] The 2080 has 4352 and should have a higher clock speed as well.
[739.00 → 743.00] Delivering better performance for less than half the price, which is pretty awesome.
[743.00 → 747.00] It's targeted squarely at the console market with that pricing.
[747.00 → 752.00] I don't know how much I agree with that.
[752.00 → 758.00] There's a note that says, or because we don't know the exact pricing, and it's rumoured to be high, it might actually undercut the consoles.
[758.00 → 762.00] I mean, yeah, for just the graphics card.
[762.00 → 766.00] I don't think that's how people price systems out.
[766.00 → 778.00] That's an interesting angle at it, though, because like I think that most people don't expect that AMD is going to come out with cards in the fall that compete with a video on the high end.
[778.00 → 779.00] Yeah.
[779.00 → 781.00] Or I mean, who knows?
[781.00 → 786.00] Their last card, the 5600, 5700 XT was like it was OK.
[786.00 → 788.00] And it was like it's a little impressive.
[788.00 → 789.00] Yeah.
[789.00 → 798.00] But I think that specifically given the timing of this launch and the fact that there are consoles coming out in a few months or less than a few months.
[798.00 → 824.00] It's there is the speaking of AMD has teased our DNA to in a fortnight Easter egg in the AMD battle arena map, which I didn't know was a thing simply stating something big is coming to the AMD battle arena unlocked by entering the code 6000 while playing, which is almost certainly a reference to the naming scheme for those cards.
[824.00 → 832.00] So so so one of my big things here that has been driving me nuts and I tried to be spicy in a tweet, and it didn't really hit home all that well.
[832.00 → 839.00] One, because I forgot that I guess I bought my first car a very long time ago and inflation has happened.
[839.00 → 840.00] So I tried.
[840.00 → 841.00] I tried.
[841.00 → 842.00] I tried.
[842.00 → 846.00] Yeah, I tried to make a comment about that and that didn't hit home super well.
[846.00 → 853.00] And I mentioned that, like they've been increasing the release dates and that's sort of but also not sort of true.
[853.00 → 867.00] So like the 580 came out November 9th kind of end of the year 2010 680 came out March 2012 780 came out May 2013 980 came out September 2014.
[867.00 → 872.00] We're seeing mostly year after year releases through 580 687 89 80.
[872.00 → 879.00] Then the 980 TI comes out in June 2015 and this sets a little bit of a trend.
[879.00 → 890.00] The 1080 comes out in May 2016, and then we don't see 2080 for a while because the 1080 TI then comes out in March 2017.
[890.00 → 893.00] 2080 comes out in September 2018.
[893.00 → 896.00] We don't see 3080 for a while.
[896.00 → 902.00] They released the 2080 in 2080 super sorry in July 2019.
[902.00 → 903.00] Then we finally see the 3080.
[903.00 → 912.00] So one of my comments was like, yeah, it's not super hard to make like fantastic generational leaps when you release things so spread apart.
[912.00 → 917.00] But that's not super accurate because they've been releasing things fairly spread apart for a while now.
[917.00 → 919.00] They just didn't use to.
[919.00 → 923.00] Yeah, but you're like, oh, well, we're not on a yearly thing anymore.
[923.00 → 925.00] And I'm like, I don't think it's been that for a little bit.
[925.00 → 927.00] Yeah, it's been it's been a little while.
[927.00 → 933.00] It hasn't been that many generations, but it has been quite a few years because they've slowed it down so much.
[933.00 → 942.00] 700 series and the 900 series were like, oh, wait, but that was kind of confusing because they're like they kind of skipped the eight one dates 100 series, and it was mobile only.
[942.00 → 945.00] The seven and nine were really close.
[945.00 → 946.00] Yeah, yeah.
[946.00 → 958.00] It was once we started getting into the four digit series, like transitioning from nine to one thousand and one thousand to two thousand and two thousand to three thousand have all been these like big jumps with a TI in between essentially.
[958.00 → 962.00] I mean, to talk about your tweet about the car for fifteen hundred dollars.
[962.00 → 965.00] I mean, that's not you can find like scrapper.
[965.00 → 966.00] You still sort of can.
[966.00 → 971.00] Yeah, it just would have been a lot easier like it would just be like a terrible car.
[971.00 → 972.00] Yeah.
[972.00 → 974.00] Yeah, that's all you need to get your point A to B.
[974.00 → 978.00] Yeah, I got one response to somebody who was like my first car was like fifty thousand dollars.
[978.00 → 979.00] I was like, OK, calm down.
[979.00 → 982.00] But lucky person.
[982.00 → 994.00] But the point I guess I was trying to make, regardless of how well that tweet actually hit, was like I'm just I don't know.
[994.00 → 1000.00] I don't think the excitement and the braggart ness is warranted.
[1000.00 → 1002.00] It's its been a pretty big gap.
[1002.00 → 1006.00] OK, that's been a trend for a little while now, but it has been a pretty big gap since the last card.
[1006.00 → 1007.00] And.
[1008.00 → 1012.00] Two thousand series was a massive disappointment.
[1014.00 → 1024.00] Was it like if you remember, if you remember the talks around like 2080 TI and RTX when it first came out, there was that I believe it was Tom's article talking about like
[1024.00 → 1028.00] do you want to live any amount of your life without RTX?
[1028.00 → 1030.00] And everyone was like, no, I don't care.
[1030.00 → 1034.00] And almost all the reviewers recommended that people don't really buy it like it was.
[1034.00 → 1036.00] It didn't really hit home all that well.
[1036.00 → 1041.00] And then they're following up that launch with like actual improvement.
[1041.00 → 1047.00] It didn't hit home well because Nvidia puts such a heavy emphasis on ray tracing and how it's the future and like blah, blah, blah.
[1047.00 → 1053.00] And then it turns out that, OK, you get a huge performance penalty and it looks really nice.
[1053.00 → 1060.00] But like you can basically play like single player games like work a, you know, 100 FPS or whatever.
[1060.00 → 1061.00] You're playing like 1080p 30.
[1061.00 → 1067.00] But like in a very small amount of performance for non ray traced games.
[1067.00 → 1070.00] I thought I don't know. It was like it was definitely a huge jump in performance.
[1070.00 → 1071.00] Was it not?
[1071.00 → 1084.00] I think the community moved to it mostly because the 10,000 or the yeah, the 1000 series cards were cycled out, and you might as well buy the new things that price replaced them.
[1084.00 → 1088.00] It wasn't. I don't think it was like this massive leap.
[1088.00 → 1089.00] So I think it's easier.
[1089.00 → 1091.00] No, it wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't.
[1091.00 → 1093.00] It wasn't this type of leap for sure.
[1093.00 → 1096.00] Yeah. Well, OK, that's the other thing I want to talk about.
[1096.00 → 1103.00] Getting excited is cool, but I really don't like the response personally that has happened to the 3000 series cards.
[1103.00 → 1108.00] And I think that's where I tried to like lash out with my not very well written tweet.
[1108.00 → 1111.00] People getting excited about things, Luke.
[1111.00 → 1114.00] I don't like this type of excitement.
[1114.00 → 1121.00] This feels to me like people getting super hyped for games and preordering them as fast as they can.
[1121.00 → 1125.00] People are fire selling their 2080 Tis.
[1125.00 → 1134.00] People are like if you look on Reddit, if you look on Twitter, it's like the second coming of the graphics cards.
[1134.00 → 1144.00] Like everyone is 1000% certain that this is going to be the greatest thing that has ever seen the face of the planet that is made out of metal and silicon and goes in your computer.
[1144.00 → 1146.00] Like it's its it's crazy.
[1146.00 → 1153.00] And it's entirely based off of NVIDIA's claims, which like it just like how have we not learned from this?
[1153.00 → 1157.00] That's the interesting thing is that normally with these launches, they come out, and they're like, oh, can you believe it?
[1157.00 → 1159.00] It's double the performance.
[1159.00 → 1162.00] Oh, it's the cutest of course you've ever seen the freaking thing.
[1162.00 → 1163.00] Blah, blah, blah.
[1163.00 → 1168.00] But Digital Foundry actually had their hands on it, and they actually put out some independent performance numbers.
[1168.00 → 1175.00] That does like a full review, but it definitely served to kind of like at least sort of be like, hey, this isn't all just marketing.
[1175.00 → 1176.00] That does help a lot.
[1176.00 → 1179.00] It looks like, and it helps a lot that it's a digital Foundry.
[1179.00 → 1183.00] Yeah, specifically because we've we've gotten a lot of good stuff from them in the past.
[1183.00 → 1185.00] And I think they're they're cool, and they do perfect.
[1185.00 → 1189.00] And also it's unfair because like, why did they get the freaking card first?
[1189.00 → 1190.00] Yes.
[1190.00 → 1191.00] Rude.
[1191.00 → 1196.00] I would hope that people would reserve more judgment.
[1196.00 → 1207.00] And again, it does help the Digital Foundry is there, but I would hope that people would reserve a little bit more judgment until it's out at least in the hands of reviewers.
[1207.00 → 1210.00] Honestly, preferably, though, in the hands of customers as well.
[1210.00 → 1212.00] Like it's I think so.
[1212.00 → 1215.00] I hey, I'm totally with you.
[1215.00 → 1216.00] I hate preordering games.
[1216.00 → 1222.00] I say I tell everybody, like, don't preorder anything ever, basically, because it's offensive to me.
[1222.00 → 1227.00] Who I feel like I feel like I'm pretty frugal with my money.
[1227.00 → 1230.00] Like I don't really go and buy things for myself that often.
[1230.00 → 1234.00] So when I see people like preordering a new phone or something, I'm like, just settle down.
[1234.00 → 1236.00] Just, just all calm down here.
[1236.00 → 1241.00] But in this case, I don't I mean, I don't think you can even preorder it.
[1241.00 → 1247.00] I think that's one of the one of the interesting things about this launch is that they're not allowing people to be frozen.
[1247.00 → 1248.00] Am I frozen? No.
[1248.00 → 1251.00] No. OK, you were just I was looking at something.
[1251.00 → 1252.00] Sorry. Perfect.
[1252.00 → 1257.00] I don't think I don't think you're allowed to.
[1257.00 → 1259.00] I don't think you're allowed to preorder these.
[1259.00 → 1265.00] I think they have basically there are some rules where you can kind of like preorder on the day of release sort of.
[1265.00 → 1270.00] Yeah. I mean, that's that's probably going to be a bit of a thing because I'm looking at the hype.
[1270.00 → 1272.00] There's almost certainly going to be stock issues.
[1272.00 → 1273.00] Right.
[1273.00 → 1275.00] And we've seen that in the past.
[1275.00 → 1278.00] I wouldn't be surprised if miners try to get their hands on them as well.
[1278.00 → 1282.00] So like there's probably going to be quite the dash for purchasing these.
[1282.00 → 1285.00] I haven't dived way too far into the Digital Foundry video.
[1285.00 → 1290.00] Someone's trying to say they did Doom Eternal at.
[1290.00 → 1291.00] Yeah.
[1291.00 → 1296.00] 4K max settings and a 2080 was benched against it.
[1296.00 → 1304.00] 2080 only has eight gigabytes of memory and Doom Eternal can have issues at those settings when you have eight gigabytes of memory.
[1304.00 → 1306.00] So there's like I don't know.
[1306.00 → 1307.00] I haven't dived into it.
[1307.00 → 1311.00] But one of my things like Digital Foundry is great.
[1311.00 → 1317.00] I have nothing against Digital Foundry at all, but have always said even when I was doing reviews.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] If you watch.
[1318.00 → 1319.00] If you watch.
[1319.00 → 1321.00] They're trying to say bye, I guess.
[1321.00 → 1327.00] If you watch like when I was making reviews, if you watch my review, I would highly recommend that you check out other people's as well.
[1327.00 → 1333.00] Because there's like always different ways of testing things and looking at things.
[1333.00 → 1335.00] And you should cross-examine.
[1335.00 → 1336.00] Wait a second.
[1336.00 → 1340.00] Linus let you review a graphics card?
[1340.00 → 1343.00] One at one point in time.
[1343.00 → 1345.00] Because he never let me review one.
[1345.00 → 1346.00] Does Anthony.
[1346.00 → 1348.00] Anthony does those, right?
[1348.00 → 1349.00] Yeah, but like I'm right here.
[1349.00 → 1351.00] I sit right here.
[1351.00 → 1352.00] That was the first.
[1352.00 → 1353.00] I think that was the first segment.
[1353.00 → 1357.00] All you have to do is just plug it in the system and just play some games.
[1357.00 → 1358.00] Yeah, that's it.
[1358.00 → 1359.00] For sure.
[1359.00 → 1360.00] Yeah.
[1360.00 → 1361.00] Like I can play Doom Eternal at 4K and max settings.
[1361.00 → 1362.00] It's no, that doesn't seem hard at all.
[1362.00 → 1380.00] I used to be really, really into finding benchmarking segments that I thought were perfect and encapsulated a bunch of the different things that would stress that card in that game.
[1380.00 → 1385.00] And I used to release videos about these benchmarking segments.
[1385.00 → 1393.00] Like there's a video of how you can benchmark your own system on Far Cry 3 using the benchmarking run that I used.
[1393.00 → 1395.00] There was a video about that.
[1395.00 → 1396.00] It did terribly.
[1396.00 → 1399.00] No one cared, but I used to like love this stuff.
[1399.00 → 1405.00] But Linus never wanted to like to pay me to play video games until I could find a segment that I thought was good.
[1405.00 → 1411.00] So I used to do it on my stream after work.
[1411.00 → 1417.00] And it would be the most boring streams ever because I'd get to a segment of the game that I thought was pretty good.
[1417.00 → 1423.00] And then I'd just play it like 10 times over and over and over again to like to see how repetitive I could make it.
[1423.00 → 1426.00] Like, like, can I make this really consistent every time?
[1426.00 → 1428.00] Because it has to be the same.
[1428.00 → 1431.00] Some engaging content, dude.
[1431.00 → 1432.00] It was beautiful.
[1432.00 → 1433.00] Hashtag content.
[1433.00 → 1437.00] But yeah, I just like genuinely, this is nothing against Digital Foundry.
[1437.00 → 1438.00] I think they're fantastic.
[1438.00 → 1441.00] They've released a ton of really great content.
[1441.00 → 1443.00] I'm reading a lot of hostility.
[1443.00 → 1444.00] No, there's none.
[1444.00 → 1449.00] But wait till more reviewers get to see it.
[1449.00 → 1454.00] Wait till maybe some users, if you're not 100% sure, get to see it.
[1454.00 → 1458.00] Like, like just it reserves your judgment a little bit.
[1458.00 → 1462.00] The amount of hype that I've seen out there is kind of wild.
[1462.00 → 1464.00] And I get it.
[1464.00 → 1469.00] We've been, the community as a whole these days is a little starved for new releases.
[1469.00 → 1475.00] Like I was talking about, back in the day, we used to get graphics card releases all the time.
[1475.00 → 1477.00] We used to get CPU releases all the time.
[1477.00 → 1479.00] We used to get everything else under the sun.
[1479.00 → 1482.00] There was new stuff coming out super, super often all the time, all the time, all the time.
[1482.00 → 1484.00] So it's fun.
[1484.00 → 1485.00] It's exciting.
[1485.00 → 1486.00] I get that.
[1486.00 → 1493.00] But don't, don't like, I just, I worry because some people get caught up in hype really, really easily.
[1493.00 → 1498.00] And I don't want someone to spend $1,500 on a 3090 because they think they need it.
[1498.00 → 1505.00] And like, I've seen a lot of posts like, and I know they're being sarcastic, but they're like, oh, I guess my 2080 Ti is garbage now.
[1505.00 → 1507.00] It's like, well, no, it's not.
[1507.00 → 1512.00] If you spent the money on a 2080 Ti, maybe you're Mr. Balling and you don't care.
[1512.00 → 1514.00] And you're just going to buy a new one anyway.
[1514.00 → 1517.00] But like, it's, it's still going to be perfect.
[1517.00 → 1529.00] I know people who have like, you know them, you know them personally and, and they go and buy a 3090 or, or, you know, like a Titan in the past.
[1529.00 → 1531.00] And they had just have absolutely no business buying that.
[1531.00 → 1534.00] It's like, you, you have literally no reason to buy that.
[1534.00 → 1537.00] You could do just well with like a 20, like a 70 series.
[1537.00 → 1538.00] You have no.
[1538.00 → 1539.00] Okay.
[1539.00 → 1540.00] Wow.
[1540.00 → 1541.00] A thousand percent.
[1541.00 → 1542.00] A thousand percent.
[1542.00 → 1543.00] There are tons of them.
[1543.00 → 1549.00] When I, when I talk about like the hype for these things, and I'm like, I'm hyped myself because I'm like, well, that is a huge performance jump.
[1549.00 → 1561.00] Uh, I think I'm just imagining that people like, you know, at the same time, I don't know, because a lot of people came in the writers room here when they, uh, I think Andy came around and did a float plane exclusive video.
[1561.00 → 1564.00] And he was like asking everybody, Hey, you're going to get a 3080 or whatever.
[1564.00 → 1566.00] Are you going to get a 3000 series?
[1566.00 → 1571.00] And almost everyone here said they're going to get either a 3080 or a 3090.
[1571.00 → 1575.00] Or I think one of them, I think Nicholas said he was going to get two 3080s.
[1575.00 → 1577.00] I'm like, why would you do that?
[1577.00 → 1578.00] That's why sucks.
[1578.00 → 1584.00] Like, cause like I'm the guy who's like, all right, where's the where's the price to performance?
[1584.00 → 1585.00] I want the best bang for buck situation.
[1585.00 → 1586.00] Yes.
[1586.00 → 1587.00] Thank you.
[1587.00 → 1588.00] See, that's, that's great.
[1588.00 → 1591.00] And you're going to get those better price performance outlooks.
[1591.00 → 1593.00] Once more reviewers have it in hand.
[1593.00 → 1602.00] And like, and there are things to genuinely be excited about the, the, the, the on paper performance is fantastic.
[1602.00 → 1605.00] And like the, the stuff that digital foundry pushed out.
[1605.00 → 1606.00] Great.
[1606.00 → 1607.00] It looks awesome.
[1607.00 → 1609.00] And like pushing the industry forward is great.
[1609.00 → 1612.00] It doesn't mean that you necessarily need to buy one.
[1612.00 → 1614.00] Oh, no, for sure.
[1614.00 → 1618.00] I know of people that'll run like 2080 Tis and then 1080p monitors.
[1618.00 → 1622.00] And they're not like, they're not running like 240 Hertz.
[1622.00 → 1623.00] Yes.
[1623.00 → 1626.00] They're not running like 240 Hertz, crazy stuff gaming at an insane level.
[1626.00 → 1631.00] They're just like, I just need the I need the, the cool new thing that everyone's all hyped up about.
[1631.00 → 1632.00] That's got to be a minority though.
[1632.00 → 1640.00] Hey, Hey guys in the chat, I'm sorry if you're running a 2080 TI on a 1080p monitor, you know, and it's not like 240 Hertz or something.
[1640.00 → 1641.00] Dude.
[1641.00 → 1644.00] I know, I know people that have 20, I think he has a 2080.
[1644.00 → 1646.00] He doesn't have an SSD.
[1646.00 → 1647.00] Oh dear.
[1647.00 → 1651.00] Like there's, there's a lot of, and I'm working on these people.
[1651.00 → 1652.00] Yeah.
[1652.00 → 1656.00] Well, Hey, don't mean to change people who boot off hard drives, you know, it's like you use what you got, but it's for sure.
[1656.00 → 1659.00] You bought a you had, you had enough to buy a 2080.
[1659.00 → 1660.00] That's not a balanced system.
[1660.00 → 1661.00] That's where I'm, that's where I'm going at.
[1661.00 → 1663.00] Like it's, it's yeah.
[1663.00 → 1670.00] Like if I, if you're, if you're booting off a hard drive, if you're making it work, if you're having fun, if you're interested in your computer, that's fantastic.
[1670.00 → 1672.00] Not ragging on you at all.
[1672.00 → 1681.00] Um, but like, I mean, uh, Kyle actually has a fantastic video, um, nitwit on, on float plane.
[1681.00 → 1682.00] I don't know if it's out on YouTube yet.
[1682.00 → 1684.00] Check out his float plane, go subscribe.
[1684.00 → 1687.00] Uh, but it's like specking out a system.
[1687.00 → 1689.00] I believe it's with a 3080.
[1689.00 → 1693.00] I think he might have one with a 3070 that might be on YouTube now.
[1693.00 → 1694.00] I'm not, I'm not sure.
[1694.00 → 1696.00] Um, but it's actually perfect.
[1696.00 → 1700.00] And one of the things that he talks about in the intro is like, okay, I could have taken the previous build, but it's actually perfect.
[1700.00 → 1708.00] Like, okay, I could have taken the previous build that I did with the cheaper graphics card and just plunked in the new graphics card and been like, well, it's $200 more.
[1708.00 → 1709.00] That was an easy video.
[1709.00 → 1713.00] Um, but that's not really how you should probably plan things.
[1713.00 → 1718.00] If you're going to spend more money on a computer, you should kind of holistically bring everything up.
[1718.00 → 1720.00] Um, and I, I agree with that.
[1720.00 → 1726.00] So just consider, consider these things, just be excited for it for sure.
[1726.00 → 1730.00] But don't, don't forget your brain, um, and only bring your wallet.
[1730.00 → 1731.00] Just, you know what we should do.
[1731.00 → 1740.00] You know what this means, uh, in order to make sure everyone has balanced systems, uh, Linus Tex tips just has to make everyone a PC who, who asks for it.
[1740.00 → 1743.00] They're like, please, I just want a game.
[1743.00 → 1744.00] Please.
[1744.00 → 1745.00] My parents won't give me a laptop.
[1745.00 → 1746.00] Please make me a PC.
[1746.00 → 1749.00] We just have to do it for everybody to ensure that this doesn't happen.
[1749.00 → 1757.00] You know, you know, it would actually be hilarious is if you guys did actually do it one time.
[1757.00 → 1759.00] Although you'd be setting yourself up.
[1759.00 → 1760.00] Everyone a PC.
[1760.00 → 1766.00] No, like one person, like one of the random people that asked, he was like, you know what? Sure.
[1766.00 → 1769.00] You get one.
[1769.00 → 1771.00] One a month.
[1771.00 → 1772.00] Oh, wow.
[1772.00 → 1774.00] That would actually be quite a year.
[1774.00 → 1775.00] Oh, sorry.
[1775.00 → 1776.00] Wow.
[1776.00 → 1777.00] That was too much.
[1777.00 → 1778.00] You should, you should.
[1778.00 → 1779.00] 12 PCs.
[1779.00 → 1781.00] You could get a sponsor for that.
[1782.00 → 1783.00] I don't know.
[1783.00 → 1784.00] Whatever.
[1784.00 → 1785.00] I'm going to get off this topic.
[1785.00 → 1786.00] There are more things to talk about.
[1786.00 → 1787.00] The video out of this.
[1787.00 → 1791.00] Um, as we already talked about.
[1791.00 → 1792.00] Reflex.
[1792.00 → 1793.00] Go for it.
[1793.00 → 1794.00] Yeah.
[1794.00 → 1795.00] You know about that?
[1795.00 → 1796.00] Yeah.
[1796.00 → 1797.00] That's another crazy thing.
[1797.00 → 1803.00] Because I feel like with each of these graphics cards launches, they try to make it interesting.
[1803.00 → 1804.00] Right?
[1804.00 → 1805.00] Like, yes.
[1805.00 → 1809.00] Uh, the last one obviously was ray tracing and that was the big deal.
[1809.00 → 1811.00] DLSS and the sharpening and all that.
[1811.00 → 1814.00] But this time they have that crazy performance jump.
[1814.00 → 1821.00] And they also have, I feel like each one of these extras that they kind of threw in there actually has some value.
[1821.00 → 1826.00] It's not just kind of like, uh, we reduced Jaggies by 30%.
[1826.00 → 1827.00] That has value.
[1827.00 → 1828.00] Uh, but yeah, I agree.
[1828.00 → 1829.00] Well, whatever.
[1829.00 → 1830.00] Reflex and broadcast.
[1830.00 → 1831.00] Reflex and broadcast.
[1831.00 → 1834.00] It's a slightly different antialiasing method, you know?
[1834.00 → 1835.00] Yeah.
[1835.00 → 1839.00] But this one, it's like there are concrete things that they've added that are actually interesting.
[1839.00 → 1846.00] Like, a video reflexes could, uh, uh, their technology could reduce latency, system latency, total input latency.
[1846.00 → 1848.00] It's so cool to me too.
[1848.00 → 1850.00] I think in 30, 30 milliseconds in some cases.
[1850.00 → 1851.00] Whoa.
[1851.00 → 1852.00] Okay.
[1852.00 → 1857.00] It's cool to me too, that they're going to let you visualize input latency throughout the chain.
[1857.00 → 1859.00] That is super valuable.
[1859.00 → 1862.00] Just in case you have something that's, that's dragging you back.
[1862.00 → 1863.00] You can fix that.
[1863.00 → 1864.00] That's, that's.
[1864.00 → 1865.00] Yeah.
[1865.00 → 1866.00] Reflex sounds super cool to me.
[1866.00 → 1867.00] NVIDIA broadcasts.
[1867.00 → 1868.00] Sounds cool.
[1868.00 → 1873.00] They've been doing really, uh, quite, quite a great job with their suite of broadcast stuff over the years.
[1873.00 → 1879.00] Um, voice kind of like the next step in that progression.
[1879.00 → 1880.00] Yeah.
[1880.00 → 1881.00] RTX voice is great.
[1881.00 → 1884.00] Um, NVIDIA omni verse, like all this stuff seems really cool.
[1884.00 → 1893.00] Um, they've been killing it in the like additional cool software things department for quite a while now.
[1893.00 → 1894.00] Yeah.
[1894.00 → 1899.00] And unfortunately I feel like that is the one thing where AMD has been lacking.
[1899.00 → 1905.00] Like I'm, I'm, I'm cheering for AMD as much as the next guy, you know, the, the success of Verizon.
[1905.00 → 1908.00] I've, I've, I've cheered it on from day one.
[1908.00 → 1915.00] Um, but it's just, it's sad because still in graphics cards, they're just, they're not, they haven't had that rise in level success yet.
[1915.00 → 1922.00] And maybe, maybe this RDNA two is the one that, that hits it out of the park, but yeah, you got to say about NVIDIA though.
[1922.00 → 1931.00] They had to, they came up with this reflex technology, and they had to say, okay, but we're gonna, we're going to put a module in certain monitors.
[1932.00 → 1935.00] That makes them the special monitors that has the reflex.
[1936.00 → 1941.00] They couldn't just like, you know, we have to find a way to sell these modules and monitors.
[1941.00 → 1947.00] Like right after we got through this whole G sync thing and be like, okay, now, now we need a new one.
[1947.00 → 1948.00] Yeah.
[1948.00 → 1950.00] We need a new one.
[1950.00 → 1957.00] Um, yeah, it's, and from the AMD side of things, you are much more just buying like the performance of the card.
[1957.00 → 1961.00] Um, and if they can beat them on price performance, that might be fascinating for people.
[1961.00 → 1966.00] Because I can, as cool as these features are, and I will definitely back up that they are cool.
[1967.00 → 1976.00] A massive percentage of the audience is never going to use NVIDIA broadcast, uh, NVIDIA Omni verse Machining, uh, like all that kind of stuff.
[1976.00 → 1982.00] Even NVIDIA reflex for a lot of people, I think is going to be a cool, like click the button, see it go.
[1983.00 → 1985.00] Well, there's nothing I can really do about that anyway.
[1985.00 → 1986.00] And then move on.
[1986.00 → 1990.00] Um, so I, I, yeah, no, absolutely.
[1990.00 → 1995.00] I mean like there, there is a level on which all of this is kind of, all of these extra features are fluff for sure.
[1995.00 → 1998.00] They're, they're, they're really, really nice premium features that I appreciate a lot.
[1998.00 → 2001.00] And I'm sure other people will appreciate a lot, but yeah.
[2002.00 → 2004.00] Premium features for a premium GPU.
[2004.00 → 2006.00] That's NVIDIA.
[2007.00 → 2010.00] With, with your green background right now.
[2013.00 → 2014.00] LTT store.com.
[2015.00 → 2016.00] Hey.
[2016.00 → 2017.00] As long as we're chilling.
[2017.00 → 2018.00] Yeah.
[2018.00 → 2019.00] We might as well, might as well go for it.
[2019.00 → 2020.00] I'm going to, I'm going to.
[2020.00 → 2022.00] I didn't even, I didn't even put on the.
[2023.00 → 2024.00] Yeah.
[2024.00 → 2025.00] I'm going for it too.
[2025.00 → 2026.00] Oh man.
[2026.00 → 2027.00] Did I even put the.
[2027.00 → 2028.00] Oh, oh.
[2029.00 → 2030.00] Nice.
[2031.00 → 2032.00] How well did the.
[2032.00 → 2033.00] Dude, the headphones actually go.
[2033.00 → 2034.00] Wow.
[2034.00 → 2035.00] This is actually pretty.
[2035.00 → 2037.00] It like got more comfortable when I put the headphones on.
[2039.00 → 2040.00] Yeah.
[2040.00 → 2041.00] I don't know why.
[2041.00 → 2043.00] I can see myself gaming like this.
[2043.00 → 2044.00] I feel like Naruto.
[2044.00 → 2046.00] I feel like I need to play a fighting game right now.
[2046.00 → 2047.00] This is fantastic.
[2047.00 → 2048.00] Run.
[2048.00 → 2049.00] The, the two wristbands and the headband head headband.
[2049.00 → 2050.00] The two wristbands and the headband are 100% cotton.
[2050.00 → 2051.00] Uh, and they cost 999.
[2051.00 → 2052.00] LTT store.com.
[2052.00 → 2053.00] Wait, what dude.
[2053.00 → 2054.00] 999 for the whole, the headband and the wristband.
[2054.00 → 2055.00] The whole shebang.
[2055.00 → 2056.00] Yeah.
[2056.00 → 2057.00] I'm going to try to see if I can.
[2057.00 → 2058.00] It seemed like it was like a setup.
[2058.00 → 2059.00] It seemed like we had set up that moment.
[2059.00 → 2060.00] I'm like, wait, 999, you're kidding me.
[2060.00 → 2061.00] I actually didn't know that was a price.
[2061.00 → 2062.00] This isn't working.
[2062.00 → 2063.00] What, me?
[2063.00 → 2064.00] No, no, no.
[2064.00 → 2065.00] Sorry.
[2065.00 → 2066.00] My side of things.
[2066.00 → 2067.00] That's okay.
[2067.00 → 2068.00] I'm sorry.
[2068.00 → 2069.00] My side of things.
[2069.00 → 2070.00] That's okay.
[2070.00 → 2071.00] Okay.
[2071.00 → 2072.00] It's okay.
[2072.00 → 2073.00] I'm just going to go.
[2073.00 → 2074.00] I'm just going to go.
[2074.00 → 2075.00] And then I'm going to go.
[2075.00 → 2077.00] It's going to be on the side of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the.
[2077.00 → 2082.62] I'm like, wait, 999? Are you kidding me? I actually didn't know that was the price.
[2083.28 → 2084.32] This isn't working.
[2085.50 → 2086.02] What, me?
[2086.46 → 2089.18] No, no, no. Sorry. My side of things. There.
[2090.88 → 2091.46] What happened?
[2092.26 → 2093.68] Sorry. I'm trying to do ghetto marketing.
[2096.22 → 2097.46] There we go. Perfect.
[2097.62 → 2097.94] What are you doing?
[2098.12 → 2101.38] You will not have seen that. You'll see it on the stream in a little bit if you have it open.
[2102.42 → 2103.34] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2103.76 → 2106.50] Okay, now I need to go to the stream. I have no idea what you're talking about.
[2106.50 → 2110.38] Oh, I don't have an extra streaming anywhere because my laptop sucks, apparently.
[2110.82 → 2112.96] Yes, it has still been lagging a little bit.
[2113.20 → 2116.14] $9.99 USD. Get all three of them.
[2116.88 → 2127.34] Build your next PC in style and wipe the sweat off as you deal with the heat of that 350-watt 390
[2127.34 → 2132.06] that you're definitely buying to use Facebook and play Fortnite.
[2134.20 → 2135.16] Moving forward.
[2135.16 → 2138.24] You can't even see what I'm doing, Luke. You can't even see what I'm doing on my camera.
[2138.78 → 2140.62] No, I did. Can you do it again?
[2141.62 → 2143.10] No. The moment has passed.
[2145.34 → 2146.32] All right. All right. All right.
[2148.10 → 2152.28] So much more to talk about. Oh, my gosh. There's so much more I want to talk to you about, Luke.
[2152.62 → 2153.56] Oh, my. Like what?
[2153.56 → 2157.86] Like the Intel Tiger Lake 11th Gen Mobile release.
[2158.08 → 2159.80] Okay. Are we moving forward?
[2159.94 → 2164.20] Before that, I wanted to ask you if this is what being a streamer feels like.
[2164.20 → 2172.58] Because normally on the WAN show, when I've been on the WAN show, it's like a set, and we're sitting there together.
[2172.66 → 2176.40] It's like that's not like streaming. But now we're like, it's like we're on a Discord call.
[2176.82 → 2177.18] Yes.
[2177.62 → 2181.36] I might as well be playing League of Legends in the background while we're talking about this.
[2181.36 → 2182.76] Like I feel very streamers.
[2182.98 → 2187.72] I think the biggest problem I'm having with this show is I think your laggy laptop.
[2189.44 → 2196.64] Because I think there's like vocal lag through Discord, and we're talking over each other a little bit sometimes.
[2196.84 → 2200.10] Oh, we're definitely talking over each other. There's a bunch of delay.
[2200.82 → 2205.12] Yes. But okay. Tiger Lake. Let's go. Mobile.
[2205.12 → 2211.76] Well, it's a – I just pasted this in without any of the actual details.
[2211.86 → 2212.24] None of it.
[2212.28 → 2215.92] But I can kind of talk about it off the top of my head because I remember when we did this with Tech Link.
[2216.12 → 2216.42] Fantastic.
[2216.74 → 2220.02] So this is all mobile. It's designed for thin and lights.
[2220.54 → 2226.58] So it's kind of like what – all these parts are kind of like the U variant.
[2227.42 → 2230.08] But they're kind of switching things up for this one.
[2230.14 → 2232.74] These are all – like they all end in G7.
[2233.12 → 2234.52] Hold on. Let me bring up the link.
[2235.12 → 2237.98] It's 11th gen.
[2238.08 → 2240.86] They all come with Z graphics built in.
[2241.42 → 2252.56] And the big interesting thing there is that Intel Z graphics in gaming can outperform the Ry zen 7 4800U,
[2252.56 → 2256.68] which is like also the thin and light part on AMD's side,
[2256.86 → 2261.12] and NVIDIA's MX350 discrete graphics card.
[2261.48 → 2264.42] I mean, that's like the lowest end one or whatever.
[2264.42 → 2270.12] But in terms of gaming, apparently, the Z graphics on the 11th gen is going to be pretty good.
[2271.26 → 2271.70] Integrated.
[2273.22 → 2275.20] Is it – can you just not hear me at all?
[2275.36 → 2276.86] I can't. No, I can't.
[2276.90 → 2280.40] I'm trying to – I'm trying to like – I don't have desktop capture,
[2280.40 → 2284.04] so I just moved the chart of performance stuff over your window,
[2284.04 → 2286.56] and I'm trying to like move it along with you while you're talking.
[2286.74 → 2288.08] So please continue.
[2288.08 → 2288.44] Oh, wow.
[2289.06 → 2292.06] Well, that's pretty much it.
[2292.66 → 2292.86] Okay.
[2293.32 → 2293.86] Oh, wait.
[2294.40 → 2295.76] Oh, Project Athena.
[2296.32 → 2297.88] So I don't know if you've heard of Project Athena.
[2298.38 → 2298.66] No.
[2299.12 → 2299.50] Have you?
[2299.82 → 2300.14] Okay.
[2300.46 → 2304.88] That was their kind of their like – it was like the successor to the Ultrabook initiative.
[2306.16 → 2306.80] Oh, yes.
[2306.84 → 2307.02] Okay.
[2307.38 → 2307.52] Yeah.
[2307.62 → 2310.96] The Ultrabook thing to be like, hey, thin and light laptops, this is a new standard.
[2311.10 → 2314.66] And now like, you know, when you have a thin and light laptop, you call it an Ultrabook basically.
[2315.44 → 2319.28] And Project Athena was like the next step in that so that things would be thin and light,
[2319.36 → 2323.70] but they'd also like boot quickly, and maybe they'd have 5G and that kind of thing.
[2323.76 → 2325.08] They'd be more like smartphones.
[2326.60 → 2330.44] And so that's been renamed now to Project – or to Intel Eve.
[2331.10 → 2332.42] Why are you laughing at me?
[2332.42 → 2333.64] I'm not laughing at you.
[2333.70 → 2335.18] I'm laughing at someone in chat.
[2335.30 → 2335.76] Keep going.
[2336.48 → 2337.36] What'd they say?
[2338.30 → 2342.80] They're laughing at me because they said Luke, very manly man,
[2342.80 → 2345.22] can't hear and move mouse at the same time.
[2349.18 → 2349.96] That's fair.
[2350.24 → 2350.72] That's fair.
[2351.10 → 2352.38] I was just very concentrated.
[2352.80 → 2353.26] Well, that's not fair.
[2353.26 → 2355.70] Multitasking isn't a traditionally masculine trait.
[2357.10 → 2360.10] I get to multitask for crap.
[2361.42 → 2362.38] Oh, my goodness.
[2362.52 → 2363.16] That was funny.
[2364.66 → 2365.14] Sorry.
[2366.32 → 2371.30] And then, of course, every notebook maker under the sun, Asus, Acer, MSI,
[2371.30 → 2373.88] all these guys announced 11th gen versions of the laptops.
[2374.02 → 2378.88] But I think that one of the issues is that we're not seeing a price for those.
[2380.48 → 2380.62] Right.
[2380.62 → 2383.50] And obviously, we don't have full performance numbers yet because it's just the reveal.
[2383.50 → 2392.82] But this is kind of an interesting answer to AMD's laptop parts that just released earlier this year.
[2393.78 → 2401.64] So we'll have to see whether this is good enough to kind of like get Intel back on the right track here.
[2401.64 → 2403.06] I mean, it's 10 nanometre.
[2403.54 → 2411.22] And apparently that apparently the IPC gains for these chips are somewhat impressive compared to the last 10 nanometre chips.
[2412.18 → 2412.70] Nanometre.
[2412.70 → 2415.92] But I don't know.
[2416.02 → 2423.58] I mean, there's not much to say about it, I guess, because like there wasn't like a crazy performance boost like the 39,
[2423.88 → 2425.84] which I've already preordered multiple times.
[2427.06 → 2432.14] And again, speaking of which, I would wait for reviews on these things as per usual.
[2432.74 → 2436.52] Is there like individual release dates for any of these products?
[2436.52 → 2439.50] I know they're going to be like in laptops.
[2439.66 → 2441.44] So like, did the laptops themselves have?
[2442.92 → 2444.52] I know it's called the launch event.
[2444.64 → 2446.52] So are they coming like now or?
[2448.48 → 2448.92] Probably.
[2449.22 → 2450.02] Hold on a second.
[2450.20 → 2450.48] OK.
[2450.78 → 2454.22] People in the chat maybe even know that more like off the top of their head.
[2454.96 → 2456.74] The first comment I see is 2024.
[2457.14 → 2458.22] I don't think so.
[2458.46 → 2458.82] 2024.
[2460.60 → 2461.38] Oh, Geez.
[2464.04 → 2464.40] September.
[2465.86 → 2466.22] OK.
[2466.22 → 2469.70] So, yeah, like essentially now, but maybe they're not on shelves yet.
[2471.02 → 2472.78] Similar to the NVIDIA stuff.
[2473.04 → 2473.16] Cool.
[2473.72 → 2473.94] OK.
[2475.18 → 2476.02] I think we should.
[2476.14 → 2477.00] That was that basically.
[2478.00 → 2484.12] I think we should take a quick break to talk about our sponsors other than ltdstore.com.
[2484.34 → 2485.78] $9.99 wristbands.
[2485.94 → 2487.62] Also large water bottles for sale.
[2487.72 → 2488.20] Check them out.
[2488.86 → 2490.40] And that will include.
[2492.86 → 2493.30] This.
[2493.68 → 2493.88] Wait.
[2494.00 → 2494.12] What?
[2494.90 → 2495.24] No.
[2495.24 → 2496.26] I left that there.
[2496.32 → 2497.12] That wasn't supposed to be there.
[2498.98 → 2499.34] Wait.
[2499.46 → 2500.34] What happened here?
[2500.44 → 2500.94] Murdered I?
[2504.10 → 2504.46] Hello?
[2504.70 → 2505.10] Hold on.
[2505.20 → 2505.64] Hold on.
[2505.76 → 2506.20] Hold on.
[2506.36 → 2507.06] I'm working on it.
[2507.16 → 2507.46] Uh-oh.
[2507.92 → 2510.22] None of these things are what I want to get rid of.
[2512.72 → 2513.08] Wait.
[2513.08 → 2513.82] Where are you?
[2513.82 → 2514.08] Wait.
[2514.08 → 2514.12] Where are you?
[2514.12 → 2514.82] Are you in the document?
[2515.34 → 2515.86] I am.
[2515.96 → 2516.66] But there's something.
[2516.88 → 2517.18] They're in there.
[2517.30 → 2518.48] I didn't do something.
[2518.58 → 2518.98] Hold on.
[2519.14 → 2523.04] We need to talk about a different topic really quick that you can carry while I fix the show.
[2524.60 → 2525.04] Sure.
[2526.62 → 2526.98] Um.
[2527.66 → 2527.88] Wait.
[2527.88 → 2528.48] What topic?
[2528.64 → 2528.78] Wait.
[2528.82 → 2529.70] What happened to the show?
[2529.82 → 2530.24] We can find.
[2530.30 → 2530.76] We'll be fine.
[2530.82 → 2531.76] Talk about the Nintendo stuff.
[2532.68 → 2534.10] I'll talk about the Nintendo stuff.
[2534.34 → 2534.44] Yeah.
[2534.44 → 2534.76] Okay.
[2535.44 → 2536.60] So here, guys.
[2536.76 → 2537.20] Guess what?
[2537.84 → 2541.28] It's 35th anniversary of Mario?
[2542.08 → 2543.06] I think.
[2544.62 → 2545.02] Yeah.
[2545.06 → 2545.58] Definitely not.
[2545.72 → 2546.66] I don't even know if that's true.
[2546.74 → 2547.74] It's not Nintendo, right?
[2547.76 → 2550.34] Because Nintendo's been around since like the early 1900s.
[2550.42 → 2551.22] Really shouldn't.
[2551.82 → 2552.22] Yeah.
[2552.22 → 2553.92] The card company or whatever.
[2554.56 → 2554.66] Yeah.
[2554.78 → 2555.00] Yeah.
[2555.02 → 2555.92] So it's got to be Mario.
[2556.64 → 2561.12] And so for his 35th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers.
[2561.26 → 2561.90] That's what it is.
[2562.44 → 2564.44] And so they've announced some weird stuff.
[2564.44 → 2573.40] And the first thing is an actual live RC car that you can control with your Nintendo Switch.
[2574.40 → 2578.14] So you can like to set up a virtual course around your house.
[2578.14 → 2584.84] And then like pick up your Switch and control this like actual Mario Kart that is like driving around on your floor.
[2584.88 → 2587.02] Oh, and it's got like a camera on it and stuff.
[2587.08 → 2588.42] So it still feels interesting.
[2589.28 → 2589.64] Yeah.
[2589.64 → 2590.66] I feel like.
[2590.66 → 2590.88] Okay.
[2590.88 → 2593.84] I feel like you need a Channel Super Fun revival thing here.
[2593.92 → 2596.52] Because back way at the beginning.
[2596.84 → 2598.76] YouTube Channel Super Fun.
[2598.76 → 2607.52] So Alliance and I went to a skate park with like a Joshi and a Mario in like Mario Kart setups.
[2607.98 → 2609.58] This was like way OG.
[2609.92 → 2611.54] One of the first videos we did, I think.
[2612.82 → 2613.38] Yeah.
[2613.70 → 2615.68] Real life Mario Kart RC race.
[2615.90 → 2616.80] Six years ago.
[2617.14 → 2618.34] 2.4 million views.
[2618.56 → 2620.16] You guys recreate that video.
[2620.40 → 2622.32] But with ones with cameras on it.
[2622.66 → 2625.24] Go back to like, I don't know, the same skate park.
[2625.24 → 2631.60] And then, but have people like sit away so they can't even look at the skate park and have the race.
[2633.34 → 2635.02] Because you've got the camera on it.
[2636.18 → 2636.58] Yeah.
[2636.66 → 2640.70] Skate park would actually probably be like closer to an actual Mario Kart track.
[2640.88 → 2642.14] Because it's got all this crazy stuff.
[2642.40 → 2642.58] Yeah.
[2642.70 → 2647.56] You guys could bring just some little like cones so you can map out the track a little bit.
[2648.82 → 2649.22] Totally.
[2649.48 → 2650.46] That would be awesome.
[2650.46 → 2657.16] I don't know whether you like, you must, you must map out the track before you kind of start going.
[2657.32 → 2662.28] I can't like, it can't just like start driving, and then it like lays down things as you go.
[2662.38 → 2662.52] Yeah.
[2662.54 → 2663.00] I don't really.
[2664.22 → 2670.80] It does overlay like other virtual characters from Mario Kart on the screen and like power ups and stuff.
[2671.48 → 2671.82] Yes.
[2671.96 → 2674.44] So it is like playing like actual Mario Kart.
[2675.36 → 2679.74] But you can see the, you know, honestly, I don't really see the appeal of this.
[2679.74 → 2681.28] I guess it's kind of fun for kids.
[2683.04 → 2684.44] Nintendo's for kids, I guess.
[2684.50 → 2685.24] So I don't know.
[2687.52 → 2688.30] I don't know.
[2688.38 → 2688.64] Yeah.
[2689.42 → 2692.14] So it looks like it's a bit of a checkpoint system.
[2693.42 → 2702.08] And you lay down these like the checkpoint flags, and it can see the like QR style code that goes along the checkpoint,
[2702.08 → 2704.02] which is the black and white squares.
[2704.38 → 2705.28] Oh, nice.
[2705.28 → 2711.14] And then I think it like somewhat auto maps the course out to a certain degree from there.
[2711.44 → 2712.18] That's pretty cool.
[2712.90 → 2714.78] I could see it being kind of fun.
[2715.84 → 2720.52] Use like a Hot Wheels ramp or something and like put like have, you know how.
[2720.58 → 2722.84] That would have to be a really intense Hot Wheels ramp.
[2722.84 → 2726.22] Because they're like big cars.
[2726.38 → 2727.34] They're not little like.
[2728.20 → 2729.98] Well, make it, put a few of them together.
[2730.20 → 2734.92] Put the put a few of the tracks together, and then you get on there.
[2735.68 → 2736.12] Or something.
[2736.30 → 2739.32] Because that's one of the coolest things about those new Mario Kart games.
[2739.38 → 2743.40] Like when you, when you kind of go up on the wall and your, your wheels go.
[2743.40 → 2745.90] And you're like, ooh, I'm going around.
[2746.08 → 2746.60] That's crazy.
[2750.52 → 2752.14] Good to recreate it in real life.
[2752.22 → 2753.10] That's what I want to know.
[2753.58 → 2753.86] Yeah.
[2754.02 → 2756.32] I just, I just, I think you guys should do a video on this.
[2756.48 → 2757.14] That's all I'm saying.
[2758.00 → 2758.32] Okay.
[2758.38 → 2759.28] I'll, I'll pitch it.
[2759.44 → 2759.80] Nice.
[2760.02 → 2763.60] And then the other, now the other thing is a little point of controversy because.
[2763.74 → 2764.20] Oh my.
[2764.20 → 2770.40] They've, they've released the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package bundle.
[2771.00 → 2775.28] Which has Super Mario 64, Sunshine and Galaxy.
[2775.66 → 2776.26] I think.
[2778.52 → 2779.86] Remastered versions for the Switch.
[2780.26 → 2780.98] And it's like, oh sweet.
[2781.08 → 2782.84] You're bringing remastered versions of games to the Switch.
[2783.10 → 2784.40] But you can only buy it from.
[2785.24 → 2788.10] I think later in September to the end of March.
[2788.92 → 2789.84] And then they take it away.
[2790.64 → 2793.66] People are upset about the fact that it's being taken away.
[2794.82 → 2796.24] David was quite upset.
[2797.36 → 2798.30] I don't want to say that.
[2798.30 → 2799.58] It seems, it seems a little silly.
[2799.98 → 2801.44] I, I would definitely.
[2801.64 → 2804.18] Well, this is what's so confusing about Nintendo.
[2804.58 → 2806.34] Like, like, yeah, just why?
[2806.46 → 2808.06] Like so many of their policies.
[2808.50 → 2808.90] Yeah.
[2809.62 → 2810.94] We make some perfect games.
[2811.04 → 2813.66] We want to play your games, and we want to play them online.
[2813.96 → 2815.98] And we want to give you our money for stuff.
[2816.18 → 2817.80] So let us buy the stuff.
[2817.88 → 2820.54] They're like, okay, but only for these months.
[2821.14 → 2821.58] Why?
[2821.58 → 2821.98] Yeah.
[2823.18 → 2823.50] Yeah.
[2823.50 → 2826.32] We like traditionally even want to give you more money than other people.
[2826.44 → 2826.64] Yeah.
[2826.72 → 2826.90] Yeah.
[2826.90 → 2827.54] It's been a trend.
[2827.88 → 2829.00] Maybe I don't want to buy it now.
[2829.16 → 2832.98] I got, you know, a lot of games in my queue to play, but like, maybe I want to buy it
[2832.98 → 2833.22] later.
[2833.32 → 2835.24] You know, maybe I'll put that on my wish list or whatever.
[2835.38 → 2836.70] Like, nope.
[2836.96 → 2837.66] I have to buy it now.
[2838.38 → 2839.60] It's kind of crazy.
[2839.60 → 2840.88] Because it's special.
[2842.92 → 2843.78] And then the.
[2843.78 → 2844.20] But why?
[2845.90 → 2851.88] The Super Mario Bros. 35 turns classic Mario gameplay into a 35-person battle Royal.
[2853.16 → 2853.58] Yes.
[2853.76 → 2860.46] And this is particularly funny because a fan made a his own version of the Mario Royal game.
[2860.46 → 2861.04] Shut it down.
[2861.86 → 2862.26] Yeah.
[2862.34 → 2863.16] And they shut it down.
[2863.26 → 2864.88] And that one had a hundred players, right?
[2864.92 → 2865.36] I think.
[2866.02 → 2867.12] Do you remember when that came out?
[2867.12 → 2869.14] That seems like something you would know about.
[2869.64 → 2871.36] I think it was 75 players.
[2872.20 → 2872.60] Oh, whoa.
[2872.78 → 2872.92] I just.
[2875.64 → 2876.04] Yeah.
[2876.14 → 2876.50] 75.
[2876.68 → 2878.10] The other one is 75 players.
[2878.70 → 2879.32] Oh, 75.
[2879.48 → 2879.66] Oops.
[2879.82 → 2881.48] I lied in Tech Link then.
[2882.40 → 2884.80] Guys, go to Tech Link once it's live.
[2884.84 → 2886.16] I don't think it's live yet because I have to publish.
[2886.16 → 2888.50] Well, The Verge says it's 75 players.
[2889.00 → 2889.84] So I don't.
[2890.20 → 2893.08] That's the quote on The Verge's site.
[2893.30 → 2893.64] We'll see.
[2894.00 → 2894.98] So I might still be right.
[2895.50 → 2895.90] Potentially.
[2895.90 → 2897.08] You're telling me there.
[2897.38 → 2898.00] We'll have to.
[2898.08 → 2898.30] We'll have to.
[2898.30 → 2899.18] This one has 35.
[2899.86 → 2900.48] Building a computer.
[2900.78 → 2902.58] The fan made one had them, actually.
[2903.14 → 2905.38] All the players could like to run around on the screen at once.
[2905.80 → 2912.66] And this one, it's like Tetris 99 where you're playing a game and there's 34 other people playing on the side.
[2913.04 → 2918.40] And if you like defeat a bad guy, the bad guy will like get knocked over to their game, and then they have to get rid of the bad guy.
[2919.28 → 2920.58] You ever played Tetris 99?
[2921.58 → 2923.36] It's been a very, very long time.
[2923.40 → 2925.08] But yes, I actually love Tetris.
[2925.08 → 2926.78] It can't have been that long.
[2926.84 → 2928.10] It's only been out for a couple of years.
[2928.94 → 2933.82] I think I played it like on launch, not very much.
[2933.94 → 2937.54] And then was like, oh, yeah, I really prefer playing this game on other mediums.
[2937.58 → 2938.14] I never went back.
[2938.14 → 2941.54] I mean, it was free.
[2941.54 → 2947.72] But yeah, you like send things to other people, to other people's games to make it more difficult.
[2947.84 → 2949.04] And that's how you like to eliminate them.
[2950.60 → 2957.66] But yeah, very few strange announcements from Intel to celebrate the 35th anniversary.
[2957.80 → 2958.28] Very confusing.
[2958.28 → 2959.28] Nintendo.
[2959.28 → 2959.48] Nintendo.
[2959.74 → 2960.00] Yes.
[2960.42 → 2962.26] Jumping to you said Intel.

[3108.42 → 3109.28] That was the Dragon Centre.
[3109.28 → 3110.58] Oh, nice.
[3110.68 → 3110.96] Okay.
[3111.34 → 3111.66] Yeah.
[3111.86 → 3112.34] Fantastic.
[3112.58 → 3114.18] They make sounds like cats.
[3118.38 → 3119.82] That's where-
[3119.82 → 3120.68] I'm the most dangerous dragon.
[3122.38 → 3125.40] I feel like cats probably think they are fairly often.
[3125.98 → 3126.44] Probably.
[3126.68 → 3127.30] Cats, man.
[3127.78 → 3130.64] Cats, they're so friggin' full of themselves.
[3130.78 → 3132.12] I hate cats.
[3134.06 → 3136.30] I'm much more of a dog person myself as well.
[3136.32 → 3136.70] I'm not-
[3136.70 → 3137.54] Yeah, I'm not lying.
[3137.72 → 3139.92] Like, why would you get a cat when you can get a dog?
[3140.04 → 3140.34] I-
[3140.34 → 3144.52] No offence to the cats, the cool cats out there, you know, but-
[3144.52 → 3146.42] I think it's for people that, like, don't-
[3146.42 → 3148.78] I'm going to get really judgmental here.
[3148.78 → 3152.22] But if you, like, don't want to, like, spend time or deal with your pet at all, but you want a pet-
[3152.22 → 3152.44] Whoa!
[3155.12 → 3155.88] I catch-
[3155.88 → 3160.94] I catch fire for this all the time, though, because some people have these, like, super affectionate cats.
[3160.94 → 3167.18] I just, in most of my experience, they just want to be left alone, which is completely fine if that's the style you're going for.
[3167.18 → 3169.54] Those cats aren't normal cats.
[3170.24 → 3170.92] Which ones?
[3170.94 → 3173.98] Those cats probably spent a lot of time with dogs, and then they became more like dogs.
[3175.20 → 3180.08] You can't be like, oh, cats are affectionate, and show your cat that's basically a dog.
[3180.08 → 3183.82] Yeah, I don't know.
[3183.82 → 3190.04] The reason your cat is cool is that it's like a dog, not because it's a cool cat, you know?
[3191.54 → 3192.12] I don't know.
[3192.14 → 3195.80] I've never had a cat, so I can't properly judge, but-
[3195.80 → 3196.62] I had a cat.
[3196.98 → 3201.42] My family adopted a street cat named Sassy.
[3201.42 → 3202.98] I was.
[3202.98 → 3203.46] I was.
[3203.46 → 3204.54] And she was.
[3207.04 → 3207.74] Oh, my.
[3208.46 → 3209.18] She was scratching.
[3209.86 → 3210.22] Anyway.
[3211.20 → 3211.82] Let's, uh-
[3211.82 → 3214.02] You know, we can talk about cats the whole show if you want.
[3214.44 → 3215.26] Dude, I'm down.
[3216.24 → 3219.50] Or we could talk about the first battery-free Game Boy.
[3219.60 → 3220.82] Yeah, what the heck is this?
[3221.64 → 3221.96] Dutch-
[3221.96 → 3222.84] Well, let me tell you.
[3222.92 → 3223.66] Or do you want to go-
[3223.66 → 3225.32] Why don't you tell me about it, Luke?
[3225.34 → 3226.54] I have no idea what it is.
[3226.62 → 3228.18] Well, it's not an actual Game Boy.
[3229.26 → 3229.92] It is.
[3230.32 → 3230.82] It is?
[3230.82 → 3233.76] Why don't you read the points, Luke?
[3233.78 → 3234.08] Okay.
[3234.38 → 3238.38] Dutch computer scientist at Delft University of Technology.
[3238.96 → 3240.88] Oh, giving me all the crazy names.
[3241.08 → 3243.78] Jasper DeWinkle revealed-
[3243.78 → 3244.90] That's an awesome name.
[3245.00 → 3245.72] Yes, you're DeWinkle.
[3247.06 → 3252.22] Revealed the world's first battery-free Game Boy dubbed Engage.
[3253.68 → 3259.82] Rather than having a battery pack, the front of the device is covered in solar cells and utilizes
[3259.82 → 3262.56] other energy harvesting techniques to power itself.
[3262.56 → 3269.78] The project was grown out of a study involving energy harvesting and what they call intermittent computing devices.
[3269.88 → 3277.22] Intermittent computing devices harvest small amounts of power, resulting in devices that only remain on for a few seconds rather than hours.
[3277.22 → 3282.84] This is opposed to batteries which continuously drain at varying rates until completed.
[3282.84 → 3283.08] Okay.
[3283.44 → 3284.66] No more of this.
[3284.78 → 3286.36] They wrote a whole essay.
[3286.70 → 3287.78] This is very long.
[3289.78 → 3292.60] Anthony gets very excited about writing all the details.
[3292.82 → 3293.14] Yes.
[3293.14 → 3295.68] So it's actually like an OG Game Boy.
[3296.94 → 3297.70] Is that-
[3297.70 → 3297.90] Yeah.
[3297.96 → 3298.82] That's what I'm seeing here?
[3299.46 → 3299.98] Okay, wait.
[3300.08 → 3301.38] Now I need to look at the notes.
[3301.46 → 3301.78] I'm sorry.
[3301.90 → 3305.78] Like green and black Tetris on a solar-powered device.
[3305.90 → 3307.48] I think that it's not-
[3307.48 → 3309.88] I think that it's not a-
[3309.88 → 3312.68] Like they built it themselves.
[3312.80 → 3314.04] Like it's all custom-
[3314.04 → 3315.14] Yeah, like it's not a-
[3315.14 → 3317.60] It's not a officially from Nintendo device for sure.
[3317.70 → 3319.24] It runs a Game Boy emulator though.
[3319.24 → 3321.26] So you can run Game Boy games on it.
[3322.50 → 3331.28] And I don't know if you got to this part yet, but like it stays on by having these solar panels that provide power.
[3331.40 → 3333.00] But it also gets power from button presses.
[3333.60 → 3334.36] Oh, interesting.
[3334.36 → 3334.92] And if you don't-
[3334.92 → 3338.52] If you don't press any buttons for like 10 seconds, it'll just shut off.
[3338.92 → 3340.72] It also doesn't generate sound.
[3342.22 → 3343.40] Oh, I didn't see that.
[3343.44 → 3344.96] Because sound would take too much power.
[3344.96 → 3351.50] And you know what's funny is all the framing for this that I saw in the articles are like,
[3351.66 → 3355.96] oh, they're laying the groundwork for a future, you know, the future devices.
[3357.08 → 3360.26] Not battery-powered mobile gaming devices.
[3360.44 → 3361.20] And I'm like, what?
[3361.94 → 3366.78] Like this thing can barely stay on, and it's running like the simplest 2D games.
[3366.98 → 3369.26] The screen is tiny.
[3370.12 → 3371.12] Yeah, it's very small.
[3371.30 → 3372.40] It doesn't have sound.
[3372.40 → 3379.48] Presently engages capable of gameplay for up to 10 seconds at a time by harvesting energy from the solar panels.
[3381.14 → 3382.22] It's definitely-
[3382.22 → 3384.82] It's a very cool like hackery project.
[3385.10 → 3386.88] I very much appreciate it for that.
[3387.62 → 3392.10] I don't know if it's paving the way of the future, but it's a really cool-
[3392.10 → 3393.86] Like having one of these would be kind of neat.
[3396.24 → 3398.96] Yeah, I think it's cool that these guys made this.
[3398.96 → 3406.32] Anthony made a note at the bottom that said, imagine if we could harvest energy from keystrokes and other button presses on a larger scale.
[3406.98 → 3408.70] Because right now all that power is going to waste.
[3408.82 → 3409.54] That's interesting.
[3410.06 → 3410.44] Like what-
[3410.44 → 3414.16] I wonder if it would be able to make any sort of difference at all.
[3414.72 → 3418.50] Like what if your laptop could like to get some power from like your typing?
[3418.50 → 3424.70] You have a 3090, and you have this mechanical keyboard and each key press just takes like two pounds of force.
[3424.70 → 3431.06] So that you can like to try to generate any amount of like actually impactful power.
[3431.06 → 3432.18] It's like, ugh.
[3433.24 → 3434.80] I need to turn left.
[3435.64 → 3435.90] Ugh.
[3436.90 → 3437.26] Ugh.
[3437.26 → 3443.50] It would be a good thing for self-control.
[3443.82 → 3449.66] You know, like you cut your six-hour gaming sessions in half.
[3449.84 → 3454.04] Everyone's going to have these like super jacked like hand and wrist muscles.
[3454.60 → 3456.84] Pressing down these like super heavy keys.
[3457.28 → 3459.00] Because you'd have to like-
[3459.00 → 3460.50] You'd have to add-
[3460.50 → 3461.38] I see you're a gamer.
[3461.38 → 3464.30] The like-
[3464.30 → 3467.72] The like jerks in the computing community would be the gamers.
[3467.72 → 3471.80] Because they want their like very like light, fast key presses.
[3472.24 → 3475.18] And everyone else has to have these like super jacked up keys.
[3475.56 → 3476.24] So that they can-
[3476.24 → 3479.52] Because it has to have some amount of resistance to like actually generate a decent amount of power.
[3481.10 → 3482.02] So we're like-
[3482.02 → 3483.20] Generative typing.
[3483.52 → 3483.82] Yeah.
[3484.08 → 3488.76] We're like reversing the technological path that key switches have gone down over like quite a while.
[3489.88 → 3490.28] Gosh.
[3491.38 → 3495.80] Well, actually I think typists would be more jacked than gamers.
[3496.78 → 3498.30] Because gamers are just using the-
[3498.30 → 3498.56] Yeah.
[3498.70 → 3499.34] The WA-
[3499.34 → 3504.14] Gamers would have like really, really set up these fingers and the muscles that connect to them.
[3504.28 → 3505.90] And like nothing else.
[3506.50 → 3507.46] I guess I have-
[3507.46 → 3508.26] What do you call it?
[3508.46 → 3510.62] MOB players would maybe have more fingers.
[3510.86 → 3511.42] Oh, there you go.
[3511.60 → 3512.04] There you go.
[3512.22 → 3512.32] Fantastic.
[3512.32 → 3513.12] But it would just be left hand.
[3513.20 → 3514.06] It'd be asymmetrical.
[3515.02 → 3520.16] Now you just need a mouse that has like really intense switches in it too.
[3520.16 → 3522.64] You got really strong two fingers.
[3528.22 → 3530.68] Just like your first day rock climbing.
[3530.88 → 3531.60] You're just amazing.
[3531.82 → 3533.00] And everyone's like, what's going on?
[3534.04 → 3534.74] How are you so good at this?
[3534.86 → 3535.80] I play League of Legends.
[3536.76 → 3537.34] It's the-
[3537.34 → 3539.48] It's the future.
[3539.48 → 3545.00] You guys talked Epic Games and Apple to death last week, right?
[3546.50 → 3549.10] I think we've talked about them like a couple of weeks in a row.
[3549.24 → 3549.44] Why?
[3549.60 → 3550.02] What's up?
[3550.70 → 3551.46] Well, I don't know.
[3551.52 → 3554.40] I just feel like that's something I could actually talk about instead of Kudu cores.
[3554.40 → 3555.40] We have-
[3555.40 → 3556.78] I'll take an aside there.
[3556.92 → 3559.62] We had a win very recently that we talked about last WAN show.
[3560.64 → 3569.40] We've been fighting for months now, actually, to try to get the Flow plane app on the iOS App Store.
[3569.86 → 3571.00] I forgot what it's called for a second.
[3571.94 → 3574.90] Play Store was stuck in my head because I do that a little bit more often.
[3574.90 → 3578.48] But it's been quite the battle.
[3579.32 → 3585.60] Long story short, eventually I just filed for like, can you guys call me and tell me what the heck is actually going on?
[3585.84 → 3589.26] And the guy picks up the phone and was like, oh, yeah, I reviewed it myself and everything's fine.
[3589.28 → 3590.16] So we're going to approve it.
[3590.78 → 3592.22] And I was like, great, sweet.
[3592.28 → 3595.46] We waited for months for someone to actually properly take a look at it.
[3596.06 → 3601.02] So that's live now on the iOS store and launched today.
[3601.86 → 3604.64] Dark Mode is on the Play Store.
[3604.90 → 3608.24] We finally have Dark Mode in the Flow plane app on the Play Store.
[3608.44 → 3610.40] It will be coming to the iOS app as well.
[3611.22 → 3613.98] We just hit the Play Store with it first.
[3614.44 → 3617.54] We'll see if Apple decides that you're not allowed to have Dark Mode.
[3618.16 → 3619.70] So we'll see how that goes.
[3619.98 → 3620.84] Maybe that'll happen.
[3620.98 → 3621.42] I don't know.
[3621.90 → 3622.16] But yeah.
[3622.28 → 3629.84] As long as you didn't sneak in a little sneaky disclosure about the fact that they're taking 30% of purchases or something.
[3630.04 → 3630.50] It should be fine.
[3631.08 → 3633.14] Yeah, we did nothing of the sort.
[3633.14 → 3636.26] We had Dark Mode previously in a beta on the Play Store.
[3636.42 → 3638.26] Now it's in the production line.
[3638.40 → 3641.74] So you guys should all be getting an update to that very soon.
[3642.56 → 3644.20] Dark Mode everything, man.
[3644.52 → 3645.02] Heck yeah.
[3646.40 → 3647.08] Life's dark.
[3647.82 → 3648.88] I don't like it.
[3648.88 → 3655.30] You just put it up there as a feature that people should be excited about.
[3655.30 → 3655.60] No, no, no.
[3655.64 → 3656.62] Our feature is cool.
[3656.80 → 3658.56] I think Jayden did a fantastic job with it.
[3658.60 → 3660.68] I think the design, the colourization, all of that is fantastic.
[3660.84 → 3662.34] I mean Dark Mode in general.
[3662.34 → 3664.34] It's pretty rude.
[3664.34 → 3674.12] I find it worse because every time that something, like if I reload a page in my browser to flash a white screen for a second.
[3675.12 → 3680.34] Whenever something bright comes on, it's like, oh, and it actually hurts.
[3681.30 → 3682.44] And then it goes back to Dark Mode.
[3682.48 → 3683.36] I'm like, okay, I'm fine.
[3683.36 → 3687.50] But if it's hurting you that much, that means that you're in a very dark room, right?
[3689.02 → 3689.36] Yeah.
[3689.48 → 3690.38] And you should go to bed.
[3693.14 → 3694.16] It's a nice reminder.
[3694.78 → 3696.28] I'm all about this self-control.
[3696.80 → 3697.88] Keep yourself accountable.
[3698.46 → 3700.56] Screw the invention of the light bulb.
[3700.78 → 3702.44] We need to go to bed when the sun goes down.
[3702.44 → 3702.72] Yeah.
[3702.94 → 3703.98] We don't need that.
[3707.16 → 3707.56] Yeah.
[3707.66 → 3709.80] No, there's not much to say about the Apple Epic thing.
[3710.02 → 3710.90] Other topics.
[3710.90 → 3713.62] Elon Musk made a cyborg pig.
[3714.68 → 3714.84] Yeah.
[3715.18 → 3716.02] How do you feel about that?
[3716.46 → 3718.20] I thought it was pretty interesting.
[3719.04 → 3719.60] They showed...
[3719.60 → 3720.00] Would you eat the pork?
[3722.82 → 3723.18] Yeah.
[3723.18 → 3725.62] I mean, as long as I guess I'm not eating it's a brain.
[3726.10 → 3727.58] There was a computer in there.
[3727.98 → 3729.06] But it was in its brain.
[3729.70 → 3731.46] Yeah, but you could get metal poisoning.
[3734.98 → 3735.34] Yeah.
[3735.62 → 3737.54] It was a fairly interesting demo.
[3737.54 → 3741.52] I think the community was probably expecting more.
[3742.56 → 3744.06] But I thought it was pretty cool.
[3744.32 → 3745.54] And to me, it felt...
[3746.32 → 3752.76] Like, I think some people were expecting a lot of application when they showed a lot of...
[3752.76 → 3757.06] Like, almost more API level stuff.
[3757.78 → 3758.12] Yeah.
[3758.18 → 3760.58] Like, they showed you, like, this is what we can expose.
[3761.68 → 3763.34] Like, this is the information we can expose.
[3763.54 → 3765.34] We're not really doing much with it.
[3765.40 → 3766.98] But this is the information that we can expose.
[3767.18 → 3768.90] And I think people were expecting application.
[3769.14 → 3770.38] I think it's still super cool.
[3770.38 → 3773.08] But, yeah, we'll have to wait for...
[3773.08 → 3777.96] Yeah, Elon Musk also, like, played down the whole thing where he kind of, like, described it as a Fitbit in your skull.
[3778.90 → 3790.16] Whereas before, I think when most people think of, like, this kind of brain machine interfaces, and especially coming from Elon Musk, you're like, oh, my gosh, he's making a way for us to live in the Matrix, basically.
[3790.16 → 3790.88] Yeah, yeah.
[3790.94 → 3794.34] And then he comes out, and it's like, well, we managed to put it in a pig.
[3795.16 → 3796.96] Now we know what he's smelling.
[3798.62 → 3804.26] And, like, a lot of their actual work has gone into, like, the robotic surgery stuff and, like, stuff like that.
[3804.42 → 3804.74] Right.
[3805.04 → 3810.30] You have to take care of these more infrastructure-style projects before you can dive into the more fun things.
[3811.04 → 3811.22] Yeah.
[3811.22 → 3818.84] I think when Elon Musk announces this kind of things, I kind of, like, know to be a little cautious.
[3818.96 → 3821.26] Because I know that he likes to move fast, you know, like Tesla.
[3821.54 → 3822.42] Likes the hype machine.
[3823.16 → 3825.08] He likes to say that he's going to move fast anyway.
[3825.08 → 3833.26] Like, I think he said that they were supposed to have a fleet of self-driving Tesla taxis by the end of this year or something.
[3833.46 → 3834.68] But, obviously, that didn't happen.
[3835.24 → 3841.08] But I think that when he announces these things, I'm like, okay, look, we're not going to have, like, the thing from...
[3841.22 → 3844.94] Black Mirror where you just stick it on your head, and now you're in, like, a video game.
[3845.90 → 3849.04] And you do all sorts of crazy things while you're in the video game.
[3850.20 → 3851.42] If anyone's seen that episode.
[3851.72 → 3853.06] Have you ever seen Black Mirror?
[3853.60 → 3853.96] Yeah.
[3854.08 → 3856.90] Isn't that the one where it's, like, the horror game or whatever?
[3858.74 → 3862.76] There are a bunch of episodes where they, like, put these things on their head or whatever, and they're, like, in a video game.
[3862.76 → 3867.14] But, like, the most recent season had a pretty wild episode.
[3867.42 → 3868.84] I think it's not appropriate.
[3869.12 → 3870.72] It's a little iffy, okay?
[3870.72 → 3871.12] Okay.
[3871.12 → 3871.52] So, um...
[3871.52 → 3871.72] Okay.
[3872.12 → 3873.34] I don't know if I've seen it or not.
[3874.00 → 3875.98] I didn't think we were going to get that right away.
[3876.12 → 3880.62] I think that when I see this, I'm kind of like, all right, it's going to be very, you know, incremental.
[3880.92 → 3881.14] Yeah.
[3881.38 → 3882.94] We're going to see, like, oh, we put it in a pig.
[3883.02 → 3887.08] Look, the real thing here is that, look, we put it in the pig and the pig didn't die.
[3887.84 → 3888.94] Great job, everybody.
[3889.70 → 3892.34] Apparently, they got a chimpanzee to actually control a computer.
[3892.54 → 3893.30] So, they're getting there.
[3894.14 → 3896.68] Human trials are coming soon.
[3897.56 → 3899.44] Once they figure out how to not kill people.
[3899.44 → 3901.32] Yeah, like something...
[3901.32 → 3903.14] Wait, what?
[3904.26 → 3904.72] What?
[3905.12 → 3906.18] Was this ripped off?
[3906.18 → 3906.52] What did you find out?
[3908.08 → 3908.74] Oh, no.
[3908.84 → 3909.10] Okay.
[3909.24 → 3912.88] So, for some reason, it says that this was uploaded.
[3912.88 → 3919.12] Oh, Google, like, grabbed the description from a new video, but put it under a different video.
[3919.24 → 3923.98] Anyway, if you want to go to YouTube, keep this tab open.
[3924.24 → 3924.92] Go to YouTube.
[3925.58 → 3933.56] Open a new tab on YouTube and search Linus Tech Tips OCT Neural Impulse Actuator.
[3933.56 → 3934.56] What?
[3935.24 → 3935.56] This is like...
[3935.56 → 3936.02] What?
[3936.02 → 3936.24] What?
[3936.80 → 3939.44] What are you talking about?
[3939.44 → 3945.24] The OCT Neural Impulse Actuator Plus Head Brain Mouse Unboxing.
[3945.80 → 3946.88] This was the thing.
[3947.00 → 3959.42] It didn't go in your skull, but you strapped it to your head in a much less comfortable way than the fantastic $999 combo set of sweatbands from ltdstore.com.
[3959.42 → 3963.18] But you could plug...
[3963.18 → 3973.88] There's an external box, and the wires ran from the back of your head strap thing to this external box, and the external box had a USB cable that went into your computer.
[3974.48 → 3975.42] And you could...
[3976.70 → 3977.26] Oh.
[3977.50 → 3979.26] I played Call of Duty.
[3980.02 → 3982.20] That's like an accessibility thing also, right?
[3982.76 → 3983.60] I'm sure.
[3983.74 → 3987.46] I didn't use it that way, but I'm sure it was used that way to a certain degree.
[3987.46 → 3994.44] I used it to play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, and it was interesting.
[3996.10 → 3997.14] You could...
[3997.14 → 4013.46] It was a very interesting product back then with what I'm sure was a lot less research backing and a lot less purchases, even though the...
[4013.46 → 4015.80] What is their thing called?
[4017.46 → 4018.14] Neuralink?
[4018.58 → 4020.00] Neuralink is not out there yet.
[4020.26 → 4023.82] I'm sure it'll probably sell better than this thing did because it really did not do very well.
[4024.88 → 4027.38] But it was a fascinating project back then.
[4027.78 → 4032.34] And I think this is the grand grandad.
[4032.34 → 4037.14] I like how you're trying to draw a parallel between these two things because they're completely different.
[4037.64 → 4045.74] I mean, on the one hand, you have a thing on your head that's letting you point a mouse, but it's just like you're taking a tracker and putting it on your head, right?
[4045.74 → 4047.74] No.
[4047.74 → 4048.74] What do you mean?
[4048.74 → 4051.40] It's not a tracker that you're putting on your head.
[4052.28 → 4053.16] You'll have to...
[4053.16 → 4053.54] Think about it?
[4053.90 → 4054.30] Yes.
[4055.52 → 4056.72] Oh, I missed that.
[4056.72 → 4058.64] There's other stuff to it.
[4058.64 → 4068.10] The way that they made it like an even remotely viable product was that some of the stuff that it could pick up on was like facial muscle movements.
[4068.96 → 4073.30] So you could like to scrunch your cheek, and it could tell, and it could use that as an input.
[4073.30 → 4077.76] But the more interesting stuff was like alpha, beta, wave, weird, funky stuff.
[4077.88 → 4085.58] And it trains you to eventually, without any facial movement and sitting there very, very still because if you look around or do anything, everything's going to go wild.
[4085.76 → 4093.80] But when you focus really, really, really hard, they had a Tetris game that you controlled by thinking essentially or focusing on different ways.
[4094.80 → 4100.18] They've had various sorts of doohickeys that can kind of like sense EEG's or whatever and like to do things accordingly.
[4100.18 → 4100.62] Yeah.
[4100.92 → 4102.86] Did you see that Jedi toy?
[4103.84 → 4105.94] You could like to raise the ball in the tube.
[4106.60 → 4110.22] They had like a Star Wars toy where you put it on like a sensor thing.
[4110.32 → 4110.52] Yeah.
[4110.74 → 4117.30] And you think about raising the ball in the tube, and you can like, and like the thing can sense the waves or whatever, your brain waves.
[4117.42 → 4118.46] And then it like raises it.
[4118.46 → 4118.48] Yeah.
[4118.48 → 4122.30] So this is, I mean, it's fairly far removed, but like...
[4122.30 → 4127.24] And I guess the Neuralink thing is going to be some, you know, it's going to be not that different from that.
[4127.24 → 4130.96] It's just that the detectors instead of being on the outside of your skull are inside your skull.
[4130.96 → 4131.82] And way more accurate.
[4132.16 → 4139.74] But like this is what I'm kind of talking about, whereas like the OCT Neural Impulse Actuator had a fair amount more application.
[4140.80 → 4143.68] Like I was able to use it in Call of Duty.
[4143.86 → 4146.14] They're not currently talking about that.
[4146.38 → 4155.30] They're talking about the information that they're able to collect, not necessarily how they're going to use it or how other people are necessarily going to be able to use it.
[4155.30 → 4166.30] But yeah, I mean, yeah, I can't remember whether Elon Musk like said anything specifically about the actual practical applications of this and like what you're going to...
[4166.90 → 4167.98] I don't think so much.
[4167.98 → 4171.02] I think from the get-go he's been like, you will use it to interface with computers.
[4171.12 → 4179.48] And I think that right now he doesn't want to like to say, you're going to be able to do this, you're going to be able to do this because they're still figuring it out.
[4179.48 → 4188.28] But at the very least, it was an interesting kind of proof of concept that, hey, look, we can put it in a pig and not make them explode.
[4188.78 → 4189.96] And make it not horrible.
[4190.10 → 4190.22] Yeah.
[4190.66 → 4198.26] And I think one of the big things too is like I'm sure his various companies will have first party features for it.
[4198.30 → 4204.22] I'm sure the Tesla mobile phone app will be able to be interfaced with this thing.
[4204.22 → 4208.22] I'm sure Neuralink will have some of their own applications.
[4208.22 → 4215.94] But in my opinion, the most interesting part is the API side of things, the ability for third parties to come in and utilize that information.
[4216.72 → 4222.22] Some people in the chat are saying that Elon did talk about potential medical benefits, particularly, I'm guessing, for like diagnostics.
[4222.22 → 4222.54] Yeah.
[4223.74 → 4227.84] So you could kind of like plan brain patterns and stuff.
[4228.08 → 4232.84] So you could probably maybe get a bit of a head start on like Alzheimer's or something, maybe.
[4234.58 → 4234.94] Yeah.
[4235.50 → 4236.50] I'd have to.
[4238.94 → 4241.24] I haven't seen it, but that's what some people.
[4241.28 → 4244.18] There were some pretty big claims in terms of health benefits.
[4244.34 → 4247.34] We'll have to see how those roll out in the future.
[4247.34 → 4255.42] But all of this stuff, I suspect, is going to get wrapped up in rather amazing amounts of bureaucratic mess.
[4255.76 → 4258.58] So it might be quite a while until we see any of this, to be honest.
[4259.32 → 4262.24] Somebody asks, how do I skip a brain ad?
[4262.42 → 4263.82] Which is a great comment.
[4266.52 → 4266.88] Okay.
[4267.04 → 4269.92] So I'm going to try to figure out how to do super chats.
[4270.40 → 4272.06] And then I think we're going to end the show.
[4272.46 → 4274.70] I have no idea how to do that.
[4275.78 → 4276.46] You don't know?
[4276.46 → 4277.12] I think I do.
[4277.34 → 4277.86] You do?
[4278.04 → 4278.78] Do you want to do them?
[4279.02 → 4279.22] Maybe.
[4279.46 → 4280.06] Wait a second.
[4281.04 → 4281.74] Switch account.
[4283.30 → 4284.82] Oh, I'm not signed in on this computer.
[4285.00 → 4285.32] Whooshes.
[4285.76 → 4286.34] Oh, boy.
[4286.72 → 4287.42] You have to do them.
[4287.42 → 4288.24] You have to figure it out.
[4288.32 → 4291.14] I think in Creator Studio, there's a live tab or something.
[4291.78 → 4293.66] I think I found viewer activity.
[4294.62 → 4295.44] You can do it.
[4295.88 → 4296.36] I believe.
[4296.50 → 4297.32] I think this is it.
[4297.38 → 4298.28] I'm not 100% certain.
[4299.96 → 4301.98] Victor Death says, hello from India.
[4302.06 → 4302.28] Hello.
[4304.00 → 4304.48] What's up, dude?
[4306.00 → 4306.88] Ross McCoy.
[4306.88 → 4316.04] At like the very beginning of the show, probably before we got into this segment says, should I buy the founders' edition of the 3090 or wait for AIB models?
[4316.04 → 4320.16] I think we somewhat answered that.
[4320.16 → 4325.24] He must have come in before we talked or after or before.
[4327.64 → 4328.36] Started the stream.
[4328.48 → 4329.92] I mean, either way, he didn't see it.
[4329.92 → 4347.36] Kevin Irish says, with the price performance of the new 3000 series, do you think NVIDIA will retire the GTX branding, move fully to RTX, or continue with the 16XX series to keep the GTX name as an Uber budget option?
[4347.36 → 4356.34] I feel like that's a really easy way for NVIDIA to open up some lower tier options if they really need to.
[4356.42 → 4358.36] If they feel like the market has room for it.
[4358.44 → 4368.96] If AMD comes out, and they've got really competitive cards at the low end, like all NVIDIA has to do is just be like, all right, we're just going to disable the RT features on this one and put it out there as a GTX part.
[4368.96 → 4369.82] So I don't know.
[4370.08 → 4371.34] I don't think.
[4371.54 → 4372.78] I see them not doing it.
[4373.06 → 4373.26] Yeah.
[4373.26 → 4380.08] I don't think they would ever like officially put the GTX branding to rest because they could always whip it out if they need to at any point in time.
[4381.08 → 4382.32] But yeah.
[4384.96 → 4386.32] GTX, give me the new GT.
[4387.20 → 4387.66] Oh my.
[4388.14 → 4388.96] Matthew Lang.
[4389.42 → 4393.08] Why not do a build off with the new 30 series cards?
[4393.22 → 4394.74] Invite Paul, Kyle, Jay.
[4394.74 → 4401.10] I love how he specifies gamers next to Steve, not just Steve, et cetera, et cetera.
[4401.30 → 4401.94] Do a build.
[4402.10 → 4403.38] Post the video on a certain date.
[4403.84 → 4405.72] Judge on price, benchmarks, and cooling.
[4406.34 → 4407.66] Announce the winner on the WAN show.
[4409.50 → 4410.70] Sounds like a great idea.
[4410.86 → 4413.96] Sounds like remote scrapyard wars, but not scrapyard.
[4415.16 → 4417.64] It's like remote expensive wars.
[4418.06 → 4419.00] Well, we kind of did.
[4419.12 → 4424.16] Actually, I mean, I guess it's not that different from what we just did, which is the what was it?
[4424.16 → 4427.00] The PC tech support challenge, I guess, without the tech support.
[4427.22 → 4427.54] But yeah.
[4427.90 → 4429.42] And that was live, I guess.
[4430.20 → 4430.52] Yeah.
[4430.76 → 4433.06] Just do a live thing like that, but with the 3000 cards.
[4433.72 → 4434.50] It'd be interesting.
[4435.14 → 4435.52] Maybe.
[4435.90 → 4437.34] We'll have to ask Linus.
[4437.44 → 4437.64] Yeah.
[4437.82 → 4440.58] So you're kind of talking to the wrong people right now.
[4442.48 → 4443.32] Dave Chapman.
[4443.40 → 4443.78] Hey, guys.
[4443.84 → 4445.08] Still loving my 1080 Ti.
[4445.24 → 4445.94] And you should.
[4446.48 → 4448.18] But I am tempted for 3000 series.
[4448.32 → 4448.98] Sounds good.
[4449.34 → 4451.86] Tempted is a decent place to be at.
[4452.38 → 4453.88] With this temptation, sir.
[4453.88 → 4457.72] Just wait till you get more information and then potentially pull the trigger.
[4457.90 → 4459.58] Sounds like they're going to be fantastic.
[4460.04 → 4461.20] And I hope they are fantastic.
[4461.74 → 4464.08] I just would hope that people wait for more support.
[4464.96 → 4470.48] I'm just always so confused about why people need the next best thing right now.
[4470.54 → 4472.28] Especially if you got a 2080 something.
[4473.30 → 4473.88] Just chill.
[4474.68 → 4475.28] Get one later.
[4475.76 → 4476.28] You're fine.
[4477.02 → 4477.32] Anyway.
[4477.32 → 4480.74] There's someone in here asking about Float plane support.
[4481.00 → 4484.54] You can just email support at floatplane.com.
[4484.62 → 4485.04] Super easy.
[4490.98 → 4493.30] Cooper says, Riley, I swear to God, if you shave...
[4493.30 → 4495.04] I wanted to read this first before I read it out loud.
[4495.26 → 4499.22] I swear to God, if you shave that moustache, I'm going to fly to Vancouver, drive to your office,
[4499.22 → 4502.42] and leave a strongly worded letter for your manager.
[4503.00 → 4504.30] Well, that's scary.
[4507.00 → 4511.20] I'm not going to shave the moustache for a while, but I am going to shave this beard because I've had...
[4511.20 → 4515.44] It's a bit of a new dad beard that I have let go.
