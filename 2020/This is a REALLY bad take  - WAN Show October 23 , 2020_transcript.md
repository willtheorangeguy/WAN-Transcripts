[0.00 --> 13.34]  where's my dog and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show planned
[13.34 --> 19.92]  for you guys today everything from uh let's see actually oh hold on a second what do we have today
[19.92 --> 28.80]  all right we've got a a large danish retailer coming out with the straight goodies get it
[28.80 --> 33.12]  it's oh yeah because it's danish it's a danish that's a type of donut here you know what it
[33.12 --> 38.90]  doesn't matter the point is they've got some statistics showing the depth of the rtx 3000
[38.90 --> 46.96]  series supply issues and uh i believe the word for this is oof as the kids say yeah or big big oof
[46.96 --> 56.22]  we've got some alleged rx 6800 xt benchmarks what else we got luke what's our headline topic
[56.22 --> 62.08]  our headline topic is i i think i don't actually know what the title is but i think it's talking
[62.08 --> 68.00]  about some some spicy tweets about the streaming industry um and where the how the money should
[68.00 --> 77.04]  be flowing in that industry but also intel sold their nand storage unit yeah this is crazy and i
[77.04 --> 81.56]  didn't actually see like a ton of people really reacting to this but that's actually nuts yeah i
[81.56 --> 87.64]  think that part of it might be because this was like a a long time in the making there was a
[87.64 --> 93.56]  whole well we can talk a little bit more about it later but intel has been sort of tepid on the
[93.56 --> 99.66]  whole man flash thing for quite some time just like i'm tepid on continuing this video without first
[99.66 --> 104.94]  rolling the intro wow smooth 10 out of 10 thanks
[104.94 --> 117.28]  that moment when wansho starts so late that uh that other show we do what's it called tech link
[117.28 --> 123.30]  are we like already live i bet i see comments about that on the flip page i don't like they're like
[123.30 --> 130.90]  oh tech link just went live give me a sec uh no tech link is tech link is not live for the day so
[130.90 --> 137.08]  there you go all right all right why don't we jump right into our big topic for the day do you want
[137.08 --> 141.78]  to walk us through this people keep giving me a hard time about doing all the talking on wansho
[141.78 --> 147.66]  i have gotten so many comments and so many tweets about this over especially the last probably month
[147.66 --> 153.36]  or so but the problem is every time i'm like hey luke do you want to walk us through this one
[153.36 --> 159.76]  he just like doesn't say anything because he's like busy running float plane over there or something
[159.76 --> 166.42]  or he says like two things and then just like waits for me to weigh in so i'm gonna say nothing
[166.42 --> 174.38]  you're gonna give us your whole take on this i'm going to zip my lips and stop talking in a moment i just
[174.38 --> 179.12]  i've got i will get this momentum going and it takes me a while to stop so i'm done talking
[179.12 --> 186.34]  still rolling now i will so before i get into it i will i will say that it has been it has become
[186.34 --> 194.28]  much harder to do the co-hosty role um since we became remote because it's a lot harder to read body
[194.28 --> 197.72]  language and do all that other kind of stuff to make sure that i'm like inserting at the right time
[197.72 --> 202.22]  there's also a certain amount of discord lag so it makes it a little bit more difficult of like
[202.22 --> 206.98]  knowing when i should start and when i should stop talking so that's a big part of it it's not
[206.98 --> 214.36]  all online it's for sure but um you can't see this on screen but alex alex hutchinson or at bang bang
[214.36 --> 222.48]  click on twitter went for some some spicy takes recently that was very very noticed online um his
[222.48 --> 228.22]  original very noticed very noticed very noticed 2020 it got a lot of
[228.22 --> 237.70]  when your tweet gets 5.1 000 comments but only 7.9 000 likes you did something um and it might not
[237.70 --> 244.26]  be something good and when the follow-up tweet to that gets 18 000 comments and still only 5.1 000
[244.26 --> 249.50]  likes you know you didn't do something great uh his take starts with streamers worried about getting
[249.50 --> 254.98]  their content pulled because they've used music which context for this there was a lot of dmca
[254.98 --> 260.46]  takedown emails that came from twitch about people's back catalog music being used in that
[260.46 --> 265.46]  back catalog that went out very recently this is something we we knew was coming we've talked about
[265.46 --> 270.46]  this on the wan show in the past but the action really happened very recently so again he says
[270.46 --> 274.34]  streamers worried about getting their content pulled because they used music they didn't pay for
[274.34 --> 279.92]  should be more worried by the fact that they're streaming games they didn't pay for as well
[279.92 --> 285.94]  it's all gone as soon as publishers decide to enforce it and he follows that up with the real
[285.94 --> 292.16]  truth is streamers should be paying the developers and publishers of the games they stream they should
[292.16 --> 299.24]  be buying a license like any real business and paying for the content they use this is interesting
[299.24 --> 305.98]  and i people aren't going to like this but i don't completely disagree with him in all scenarios
[305.98 --> 311.82]  i think it should be up to the publisher and i think basically any publisher that tried to enforce
[311.82 --> 317.50]  it that way would be an idiot um and we have experienced this in the past we saw it with nintendo
[317.50 --> 323.54]  um what'd you say sorry sorry i had sorry i had something really stupid caught in my throat there
[323.54 --> 331.10]  nintendo yeah exactly sorry we saw this with nintendo in the past and it was stupid and everyone hated it and
[331.10 --> 335.88]  the the the viewers hated it and the streamers hated it and it was bad for nintendo in a lot of ways
[335.88 --> 342.58]  and they've they've eased up on it in in more recent years and it has been significantly better for
[342.58 --> 349.14]  the viewers and the streamers and nintendo like it is just holistically better for everyone there are
[349.14 --> 355.76]  some scenarios where i question how real that would necessarily be games that are extremely narrative
[355.76 --> 362.32]  focused yeah basically walking simulator games pretty much the whole experience can be had by
[362.32 --> 368.46]  watching it and in those scenarios those developers might not want people to stream it and i think they
[368.46 --> 374.46]  should have the right to be like yeah i don't want you to stream my game um that being said having the
[374.46 --> 380.96]  right and should do are different and his verbiage here is talking about uh like something that will
[380.96 --> 387.68]  happen as if it's inevitable and he says specifically they should be buying a license i do not believe
[387.68 --> 395.80]  that game streamers should be buying a license and i think 2020 of any year is a great example for
[395.80 --> 401.56]  why that shouldn't be a thing games that are popping off are fall guys among us those games would
[401.56 --> 407.52]  not have popped off if it wasn't for streamers and perfect hardline evidence for that is among us
[407.52 --> 413.40]  among us didn't launch and immediately become popular with like two years ago wasn't it yeah
[413.40 --> 419.32]  among us was out for a long time and was irrelevant yeah it was a cool little game but it had like i
[419.32 --> 425.22]  think peaks of like 200 concurrent players and now it has peaks of like oh my god everyone including
[425.22 --> 431.64]  like american politicians and the biggest youtubers and also the biggest twitch stars it that game was
[431.64 --> 438.38]  made by streamers like the success of that game sorry was made by streamers uh so the the take is
[438.38 --> 445.90]  is is is bad but it becomes a lot more interesting when you look into who alex hutchinson is
[445.90 --> 455.68]  and when you look into the way he is operating and using things uh what he does in a moment i want to
[455.68 --> 460.58]  i want to do one thing i want to debate with you okay okay hold on hold on i can shut up this is a skill
[460.58 --> 467.30]  i have i can remain silent my favorite thing which was pointed out by jack septic eye i didn't
[467.30 --> 473.06]  recognize this at first the cover photo or whatever you want to call it the banner photo that he has on
[473.06 --> 484.32]  twitter for savage planet that is some game that he worked on um except the cover photo is of jack
[484.32 --> 494.78]  jack septic eye it's a fan art it's not his alex doesn't own that um the person in the photo is
[494.78 --> 501.26]  supposed to be jack septic eye in the game and what is cut off what is cropped off and no it doesn't just
[501.26 --> 507.04]  not show up because twitter squished it if you click on the photo it is still not there but you can see
[507.04 --> 513.36]  three little lines that come up from it is the signature of the person who drew the fan art
[513.36 --> 520.30]  there is no attribution and no credit given to the person who drew the fan art so does his opinion only
[520.30 --> 527.46]  go as far as music and games and does not reach into the realm of of uh of of art in the form of
[527.46 --> 536.74]  something drawn i'm not sure but he is also a creative director at sg and e montreal studio it used to say
[536.74 --> 542.22]  in his twitter bio it used to say something different it used to say creative director
[542.22 --> 550.72]  at google stadia and has been updated since this all happened i'm not necessarily sure why um but yeah
[550.72 --> 561.32]  it was updated sorry you can go so i'm gonna jump in and agree with you um okay i thought you're gonna
[561.32 --> 566.72]  debate me no i can't because the problem is that the way copyright law works and the way
[566.72 --> 574.50]  that it should work is that you own the rights to how your content is used so a perfect example of
[574.50 --> 583.64]  that is that if someone were to um make uh make a video let's say they they download you know our
[583.64 --> 590.96]  review of the rtx 3080 and they play it back and they're like oh wow this is some really good b-roll
[590.96 --> 596.68]  footage and like you know what my 3080 is sitting in my rig over there i don't feel like pulling it out
[596.68 --> 604.44]  and getting a camera i'm gonna i'm gonna use this to supplement my content now depending on how they
[604.44 --> 611.04]  do that how they utilize the footage do they leave in my commentary do they credit it do is their work
[611.04 --> 616.14]  transformative enough does it affect what are what are the four pillars of fair use again there's
[616.14 --> 624.18]  transformation uh fair use uh here we go so the purpose and character of your use what's it for so if
[624.18 --> 630.56]  it's for you know educating the public about the dangers of this linus tech tips character then
[630.56 --> 636.22]  that would be something that would be considered you know important for public interest and therefore
[636.22 --> 641.62]  more likely to be to be to fall under fair use um the nature of the copyrighted work so that's where
[641.62 --> 647.12]  you get into the style of the game you could even make the argument that certain styles of game
[647.12 --> 653.92]  are inherently covered by fair use to play them i would make the argument that yeah go ahead
[653.92 --> 659.62]  so i was thinking about this and i and i strongly agree and i think a lot of multiplayer competitive
[659.62 --> 665.66]  games especially things like shooters yeah would totally fall under that and among us and fall guys
[665.66 --> 672.48]  are examples of content probably where the participants among us i think is just such a prime
[672.48 --> 680.52]  example the participants are the content yes all this is is like a setting it's it's kind of like
[680.52 --> 686.44]  medium yeah yeah it's kind of like making the argument that you know because you exist in this
[686.44 --> 692.82]  building whoever the builder of it is or architect of it is you know owns the the work that you do in
[692.82 --> 698.44]  it like the film that you make in it it's like no no actually the content is the interaction between
[698.44 --> 704.42]  these people on the spaceship that are trying to fix it or or not um the third pillar is the amount
[704.42 --> 712.56]  and sustain uh substantiality of the portion taken so if you take just a little bit versus like like you
[712.56 --> 719.98]  might do in a review so david from our team did a review of last of us 2 where yeah he shows a lot of
[719.98 --> 727.40]  gameplay footage but it's not just the amount it's the substantiality of it so is it a lot of gameplay
[727.40 --> 733.74]  footage of wandering around or did he just make a mashup of every story cut scene and then upload
[733.74 --> 738.68]  it so that you don't have to buy the game that's where you get into that one and then that ties in
[738.68 --> 743.32]  really nicely with pillar number four which is the effect of the use upon the potential market
[743.32 --> 750.00]  for the original art so once again depending on the type of game yeah among us is a key example
[750.00 --> 757.76]  of something where honestly streaming it can do pretty much nothing but get people amped on this
[757.76 --> 764.54]  game and wanting to play it and the only way to play it legitimately is to buy it it would be very
[764.54 --> 771.12]  very very difficult to make an argument that streaming among us reduces sales there is games
[771.12 --> 776.78]  where it would be very very easy to make an argument that streaming that game does reduce sales
[776.78 --> 781.98]  100 it's not that common i'd say but it is definitely a thing and there are there are games
[781.98 --> 787.28]  where if i was a publisher for a lot of those games honestly i would still want them streamed
[787.28 --> 792.46]  it's tough though it's really tough but it is tough if i could totally understand someone not having that
[792.46 --> 798.36]  opinion if i was a developer for a really really rich story-driven single-player experience game
[798.36 --> 805.18]  where i went out of my way to not embed it with a bunch of microtransactions and crap and
[805.18 --> 812.14]  i released this game for a fair price you know let's say 29.99 for this game i'm a pretty small
[812.14 --> 819.48]  development studio okay and a whole bunch of streamers get out there you know the day before
[819.48 --> 826.24]  launch with their pre-release copies pretty much upload you know the game skipping through the boring
[826.24 --> 833.82]  parts and into these like four you know a four part uh you know four one hour videos uploaded to
[833.82 --> 837.78]  youtube part one part two part three part four okay now i've moved on to my next thing they're
[837.78 --> 844.12]  doing nothing in the long term actually promoting the game they've just basically uploaded my game
[844.12 --> 851.70]  to youtube and the reviews are great but my sales suck i would be really choked because that's a type
[851.70 --> 857.20]  of game that people claim to want yeah people say hey you know what happened to gaming why is
[857.20 --> 862.60]  everything microtransactions why is everything multiplayer only what happened to what happened to long
[862.60 --> 869.60]  deep single player narratives well that's something that could very well be what happened to long
[869.60 --> 876.52]  single player narratives and also money but but that is a factor and ignoring that factor i think is
[876.52 --> 884.62]  not looking at the bigger picture in a fair manner yeah and i i think his take on it was terrible
[884.62 --> 890.32]  and i think the entire industry has has told him that time and time again at this point
[890.32 --> 898.32]  um and and hopefully someone who's a creative director at a freaking gaming studio and had at
[898.32 --> 904.12]  least something to do with stadia despite it no longer being in his bio yeah i would hope that he
[904.12 --> 909.82]  would understand that and it genuinely concerns me for the future of the games that he has any
[909.82 --> 916.72]  opinion on their development of that he actually thought and or thinks that way but ultimately i don't
[916.72 --> 922.82]  think that is a common opinion in the industry if you look at how this is actually being dealt with
[922.82 --> 929.26]  by actual people um a lot of streamers are paid to play games not the other way around the other way
[929.26 --> 936.10]  around um and it's sort of like it's laughable right to say that oh well you know you should license
[936.10 --> 942.72]  the game and then you know the developer should so you should pay to license the game and then the
[942.72 --> 948.84]  developer should pay you to play it like why why am i just pulling money out of my right pocket to put
[948.84 --> 952.44]  in your right pocket and you pull it out of your left pocket to put it in my left pocket like why
[952.44 --> 956.50]  are we why are we playing why are we playing this this why are we doing this dance it doesn't make
[956.50 --> 961.90]  any sense inflating a bunch of like payment processors takes for no reason exactly which is
[961.90 --> 968.82]  like personally offensive to me but that's a different conversation um 100 but like it's yeah it's it's
[968.82 --> 974.72]  silly it's it's a bad take and i think one thing that i that i would suggest to take from this is
[974.72 --> 982.68]  like if you do watch a streamer and they are playing a very uh narrative heavy single player game yeah
[982.68 --> 988.54]  that doesn't necessarily look like it's it's mechanics or it's action or anything like that are
[988.54 --> 993.58]  really what make it good and what makes it good is the fact that you're you're basically like watching
[993.58 --> 999.26]  an interactive movie um maybe try to find a way to support those guys maybe don't buy some bits that
[999.26 --> 1005.10]  day maybe maybe buy that game that day that might be a good idea or go buy some merch even a lot of
[1005.10 --> 1010.96]  games these days will have like a soundtrack or or a shirt or something like try to throw something
[1010.96 --> 1017.24]  towards those developers because um i can i can definitely feel sympathy for that and i love those
[1017.24 --> 1022.80]  types of games sometimes i don't know sometimes one other thing is it's games whatever um so
[1022.80 --> 1028.32]  yeah also i just realized that he worked on my least favorite assassin's creed game ever thanks
[1028.32 --> 1033.36]  buddy how about that so tank master in the youtube chat says the problem is streamers aren't protected
[1033.36 --> 1038.32]  by the eu la they're actually breaking the terms of service the way game eulas are written currently
[1038.32 --> 1044.70]  and that is a good point but the problem is that there's the legality and then there's the morality
[1044.70 --> 1050.12]  and then there's the court of public opinion there's sort of like multiple facets to any kind of
[1050.12 --> 1057.78]  decision like this from a legal point of view nintendo was right that's our mario sprite and no
[1057.78 --> 1068.26]  you may not monetize it like they weren't wrong but they were stupid you know um so from like uh from
[1068.26 --> 1075.22]  like a moral standpoint going after people that are honestly not making a ton of money you know people
[1075.22 --> 1083.56]  like speed runners or level designers or like yeah like the kinds of the kinds of and again that comes down to those four pillars right
[1083.56 --> 1089.84]  speed running a game does not have nearly the effect on the potential market for the product
[1089.84 --> 1094.28]  as playing it properly and having someone sit and watch you you could make that argument
[1094.28 --> 1103.08]  the and okay so and then there's the there's also the court of public opinion where you can do these things and you might be legally and maybe even morally correct
[1103.08 --> 1110.14]  but people are going to hate you for it and at the end of the day you're a business that relies on the goodwill of your customers so maybe you just better not do that
[1110.14 --> 1117.92]  now the problem with fair use i actually we had a really interesting fair use conversation in our community this week
[1117.92 --> 1126.74]  what happened was um oh man when was it i have a stream called addressing the drama from about a thousand years ago
[1126.74 --> 1132.32]  a year ago i think addressing the drama it was at least a year ago streamed a year ago all right so a year ago
[1132.32 --> 1141.14]  we had an issue where a smaller youtuber was issued a copyright notice to be clear that it's not the same thing as a copyright strike
[1141.14 --> 1145.96]  so there was no effect on their channel but what happens is if you're issued a copyright notice it means
[1145.96 --> 1154.10]  that some other entity whether it's um like a music label or another youtuber or a movie a movie house
[1154.10 --> 1162.86]  um some other entity said hey your video contains my copyrighted content so you need to let me monetize that video
[1162.86 --> 1168.44]  but it's okay you can leave it up and there's no there's no strikes on your channel it's not going to get deleted or anything
[1168.44 --> 1171.74]  but that's actually my content and you need to give me the money
[1171.74 --> 1180.22]  so what happened was we issued through our mcn a copyright notice to a smaller youtuber for some
[1180.22 --> 1185.54]  game player actually it was benchmark footage that was included in their video now we dug into what
[1185.54 --> 1189.48]  happened it was not something we did maliciously and it was not something that we did manually or on
[1189.48 --> 1196.52]  purpose at all and what happened was our threshold for recognizing our video clips so we enabled a feature
[1196.52 --> 1202.52]  through our mcn or multi-channel network that will look for our footage in other people's videos
[1202.52 --> 1208.64]  and claim against it because we've had big problems in the past with people just re-uploading our videos
[1208.64 --> 1217.42]  to these rando no-name channels and it's actually a lot of my time personally to take those down um
[1217.42 --> 1223.64]  like i have to go fill out a whole form and when i have to do like six or eight of them a day
[1223.64 --> 1228.44]  like it's it's very time consuming and i'm sure you guys would rather me just spend my time making
[1228.44 --> 1233.54]  videos rather than taking down other people's re-uploads of them so we enabled this feature
[1233.54 --> 1238.42]  but what happened was the threshold was set very low i think it was set to about 15 seconds of match
[1238.42 --> 1245.88]  and so it grabbed benchmark footage like screen cap of a benchmark that they also used and claimed it
[1245.88 --> 1253.00]  now all it was a matter of doing was saying hey guys what's up and we said oh sorry about that
[1253.00 --> 1257.10]  reverse the claim all you have to do is dispute the claim and it'll send a notification back to
[1257.10 --> 1265.26]  whoever claimed it um we got that all sorted out and um we changed our threshold to a minute
[1265.26 --> 1274.22]  now what happened this week was another youtuber in this case it was adored tv uploaded a video and the
[1274.22 --> 1278.44]  the kind of ironic thing about it was that i think probably from his perspective
[1278.44 --> 1288.16]  was that his video used a chunk of our video as sort of like validation that his take was correct
[1288.16 --> 1294.84]  it was a it was a clip of me agreeing with him and then i think what happened was he got this
[1294.84 --> 1302.76]  notification oh by the way um linus media group inc actually full screen inc has claimed this content
[1302.76 --> 1307.90]  because it contains you know however long i think it was 57 seconds or whatever it was
[1307.90 --> 1312.72]  of copyrighted content from this video from linus media group inc i forget exactly what the wording
[1312.72 --> 1318.44]  of the notice that he got was but apparently not being familiar with this wording he thought or like
[1318.44 --> 1325.80]  with this process he thought that we had manually claimed the video and we're taking his uh taking his
[1325.80 --> 1332.42]  revenue and what happened anyway the point is i found out about it we got it dealt with in about
[1332.42 --> 1338.04]  10 minutes it's all sorted out we had some twitter feuding and we're good now it's all water under the
[1338.04 --> 1342.90]  bridge but what was really interesting about this whole ordeal was that it raised some really
[1342.90 --> 1350.82]  interesting conversations about what exactly is fair use and how does it work a lot of people seemed to
[1350.82 --> 1357.52]  think that it was as simple as when people thought that this was me manually claiming his money yeah
[1357.52 --> 1362.46]  it's like i don't know what the ad sense on it would be like 60 dollars by the time i had looked at
[1362.46 --> 1366.28]  it like it didn't have a ton of views yet it's definitely worth the drama i can understand the
[1366.28 --> 1374.32]  decision there i need that 60 that badly i really do um and to be clear once it's reversed it all goes
[1374.32 --> 1379.46]  back to the original creator i don't keep any of it even if it was like claimed by me for two hours or
[1379.46 --> 1387.26]  whatever um so people seem to think that this was like me being evil and not understanding fair use
[1387.26 --> 1394.44]  and like linus this is clearly fair use the thing about fair use is that it's actually not cut and dried
[1394.44 --> 1404.34]  what it is is it's four pillars not for four things you can argue in court basically yes and you actually
[1404.34 --> 1409.40]  when i'm glad that you mentioned uh i'm glad you mentioned arguing court because the way that it works
[1409.40 --> 1416.74]  is you actually have to argue these things and there's no clear measurement for you know
[1416.74 --> 1423.74]  what people had all kinds of thoughts about how fair use worked well it was a minute of content but it
[1423.74 --> 1430.28]  was only four percent of the total video because it was a much longer video therefore it's fair use
[1430.28 --> 1437.60]  no that's not how that works or people would said well he wasn't saying anything mean about linus
[1437.60 --> 1443.04]  so it's fair use which again no it's not how that works i'd almost say if you were saying something
[1443.04 --> 1448.66]  mean it would probably be easier to place it as a review and you'd probably get by with it
[1448.66 --> 1455.20]  almost more easily in the eyes of a jury or something well it depends because if it was defamatory then
[1455.20 --> 1460.80]  you could make the argument that yeah um its effect on the potential market was very negative because
[1460.80 --> 1467.60]  he's effectively attacking the opinion of someone who lives and dies or the reputation of someone who
[1467.60 --> 1473.12]  lives and dies by their reputation so but but that that's what that's what it is so that's why it
[1473.12 --> 1478.58]  actually doesn't matter how much of it it was or are all these arbitrary things that people seem to
[1478.58 --> 1485.94]  have latched on to as like what definitely makes something fair use fair use is an argument
[1485.94 --> 1494.04]  it is not a set of rules so the purpose and character of your use the nature of the copyrighted
[1494.04 --> 1500.06]  work the amount and substantiality of the portion taken and the effect on the potential market for the
[1500.06 --> 1507.36]  original work and remember too that fair use like these guidelines as far as i know are just based on
[1507.36 --> 1514.24]  united states copyright laws they are not necessarily applicable in every jurisdiction around the world
[1514.24 --> 1520.78]  so you could very easily be infringing on the copyright of some developer in lithuania or
[1520.78 --> 1528.08]  something to be clear i know absolutely nothing about lithuanian copyright law but fair use might
[1528.08 --> 1535.44]  not necessarily apply and if somehow they manage to get you dragged into a lithuanian legal proceeding
[1535.44 --> 1541.06]  it might not go well for you i don't know how they do that maybe you have a stopover in lithuania on
[1541.06 --> 1546.50]  the way to wherever it is you're flying to once the world returns to normal but the point is somehow
[1546.50 --> 1554.82]  they get you extradited uh the point is fair use is not as simple as people seem to think that it is
[1554.82 --> 1563.50]  the very fact that you are a game streamer and therefore streaming games is fair use it no not to the law
[1563.50 --> 1570.34]  but in the same way that you would have to make your argument to a court about why what you're doing
[1570.34 --> 1576.66]  is fair use whoever is defending their copyright would have to make an argument to a court about
[1576.66 --> 1582.02]  that it is not fair use which is why as we saw with that whole h3h3 thing that went down a couple years
[1582.02 --> 1589.10]  ago now i think it was this kind of legal proceeding can get very long very drawn out and very very
[1589.10 --> 1596.82]  expensive which is why it's far better so back to what the law is versus what you should do it's far
[1596.82 --> 1602.14]  better to just not put this much work and money into doing nothing but p***ing off your customers
[1602.14 --> 1610.16]  and just let people game stream so that's why alex hutchinson's take is bad not because he's wrong
[1610.16 --> 1617.02]  but because it's a bad dumb take it's just stupid and a lot of the the verbiage that he used was
[1617.02 --> 1626.42]  him saying what what people should do not not not not what is like entirely within their rights or
[1626.42 --> 1632.20]  or what like they're capable of he was like no this is how it should work blah blah blah and that's
[1632.20 --> 1639.24]  really dumb um so that was a bad take and and that's why it was so bad i think he could have
[1639.24 --> 1645.56]  gotten what i'm hoping was his point across uh in a different way if he didn't use that type of
[1645.56 --> 1652.74]  wording i also think it is truly hilarious that he isn't uh attributing the artist for his for his
[1652.74 --> 1658.78]  uh cover photo that that is like that really makes this whole thing like so much worse and the fact
[1658.78 --> 1668.50]  that jacksepticeye posted that i i'm sure he saw jacksepticeye's post i doubt it jacksepticeye's he's a
[1668.50 --> 1674.56]  pretty small figure in the gaming space he's probably never heard of him the fact that he
[1674.56 --> 1680.66]  hasn't responded and like i don't know apologize or just change it quiet fine or changed it yeah you
[1680.66 --> 1686.98]  don't want to own your mistake fine quietly change it then do something why is it still there do you
[1686.98 --> 1691.90]  remember remember how i said like it it it had a lot of traction but it didn't have like the
[1691.90 --> 1695.50]  interaction you would want i was pointing out the like comments versus likes and stuff yeah just
[1695.50 --> 1704.82]  see how many times he got ratioed yeah basically jacksepticeye's post got 48 000 likes his got 5.1
[1704.82 --> 1710.70]  yeah i forget who i saw who just posted um oh yeah i think it was pokimane was just like i'm gonna just
[1710.70 --> 1714.50]  put this here so that you can see how badly you're gonna get ratioed or something like that
[1714.50 --> 1723.66]  oh my god yeah that probably blew up oh lordy oh so dumb i only learned that term today by the way
[1723.66 --> 1729.68]  oh really oh okay me ratioed yeah yeah i i learned it from this i was like oh that makes sense that's
[1729.68 --> 1734.04]  that's funny i've seen that happen before i'm glad we have a word for that you know what else i'm glad
[1734.04 --> 1739.08]  we have a word for thing that like makes more sense in other places so do you know what venmo even is
[1739.08 --> 1745.74]  what is venmo i think it's like a paypal style thing that is often used for direct payments between
[1745.74 --> 1751.38]  people more often like paypal is often used for for person to company i think venmo is often used for
[1751.38 --> 1755.56]  person to person i don't think it's really a thing in canada because we have a money transfer
[1755.56 --> 1762.98]  yeah oh sorry it's not called email money transfer transfer yeah yeah man when emt like first came
[1762.98 --> 1768.70]  out i was like this is amazing because it was the best thing ever you didn't have to take cash to like
[1768.70 --> 1773.94]  uh in-person craigslist deals and stuff anymore you could just send an email money transfer and i
[1773.94 --> 1778.42]  guess okay sorry e-transfer and then they could validate it right there and then you could both leave
[1778.42 --> 1782.28]  and you didn't have to have any cash on you which was really nice uh the show is also brought to you
[1782.28 --> 1787.90]  by a wondershare pdf element this is a new one pdf element is an all-in-one smart pdf editor that
[1787.90 --> 1792.54]  offers the easiest way to create edit convert annotate and sign pdf documents on windows and mac
[1792.54 --> 1799.76]  you can convert any pdf to and from microsoft word excel why would you want to convert a pdf
[1799.76 --> 1805.72]  to or from excel i guess it doesn't matter why it matters that you can and powerpoint without
[1805.72 --> 1809.84]  losing any formatting you can easily collect analysis ready data from your clients by
[1809.84 --> 1815.48]  fillable pdf forms from paper or existing electronic files and search for words or text through large pdf
[1815.48 --> 1819.94]  files you can add certified digital signatures to help recipients validate document authenticity and
[1819.94 --> 1826.56]  integrity and you can click the link in the description to get 50 off pdf element let's go ahead
[1826.56 --> 1831.66]  and these that that's funny wondershare i think has been reaching out to us literally for years
[1831.66 --> 1836.84]  to work together and they finally have a product that's like yeah okay that seems that seems pretty
[1836.84 --> 1842.36]  good cool well i think before they were trying to get us to like review something and i was like yeah
[1842.36 --> 1848.36]  we don't review like these kinds of software tools so i this this this makes this makes way more sense
[1848.36 --> 1856.04]  we gotta bring we gotta bring lsd back lsd you don't remember that do you named it software luke's
[1856.04 --> 1862.86]  software ah shoot what was the d for discovery i think or something i love the d luke software
[1862.86 --> 1867.68]  discoveries that's what it was you just call it linus whatever it doesn't matter but like
[1867.68 --> 1873.76]  yeah i don't know it's really hard to find things that are good enough to talk about for that amount
[1873.76 --> 1879.40]  of time oh yeah when it's software and finally the show is brought to you by redux redux offers
[1879.40 --> 1885.60]  hardware with no markup pricing only a 75 build fee so you would pay to buy the parts yourself
[1885.60 --> 1888.84]  so what you would pay to buy the parts yourself would be the same as you pay with redux with
[1888.84 --> 1892.90]  expertly built pcs plus they give you a two-year warranty for parts and labor you can explore the
[1892.90 --> 1897.46]  website and get a pc optimized for the games you play in as easy as a few clicks and use the online
[1897.46 --> 1901.84]  pc builder to customize what's going on inside based on the games you want to play that's basically the
[1901.84 --> 1907.00]  same thing i just said redux hey redux redux believes in bringing pc gaming to the masses and
[1907.00 --> 1911.00]  that's why they only charge a small build fee and won't cut corners on quality you can go to
[1911.00 --> 1918.36]  buildredux.com or click the link in the description to enter to win an rtx 3080 wow that's like a that's
[1918.36 --> 1926.18]  like a three thousand dollar value depending on how you want to do the math on that subject
[1926.18 --> 1931.98]  why don't we talk about uh who dumped this one in the doc anthony posted this in the doc a large
[1931.98 --> 1938.26]  danish retailer going by the name of pro shop has released statistics for the rtx 30 series sales
[1938.26 --> 1944.04]  and the orders that they've shipped and uh let me put it this way it doesn't look promising
[1944.04 --> 1954.22]  it brokey it brokey um pro shop ordered 16 skews for each class of gpu from asus msi gigabyte and
[1954.22 --> 1961.44]  inno 3d and here are the statistics as of october 22nd which was yesterday pro shop ordered 2012
[1961.44 --> 1968.38]  units of that 309 have been delivered or are incoming which is a fulfillment rate of
[1968.38 --> 1978.26]  15 percent 312 unfilled orders with 161 delivered to customers making for a delivery rate of 34
[1978.26 --> 1983.76]  percent 65 if you count the confirmed incoming cards but those have not technically shipped to
[1983.76 --> 1990.28]  customers yet in spite of the fact that these cards have been available for weeks um for the rtx 3080
[1990.28 --> 1999.84]  wow that's 3090 they've only shipped 309 to pro shop okay all right wow that's a lot of gpu
[1999.84 --> 2007.22]  how many people like that many people are buying 1500 graphic cards okay uh uh sorry no wonder nvidia
[2007.22 --> 2019.34]  like has enough money to buy arm um rtx 3080 pro shop says they ordered 9010 and have received 871
[2019.34 --> 2026.90]  including those which are incoming a fulfillment rate of 9.7 percent they have luke's laughing he's
[2026.90 --> 2038.08]  reading ahead of me here they have 3 772 unfilled orders and have managed to deliver only 504 to
[2038.08 --> 2046.74]  customers a delivery rate of 12 or 20 if we count the confirmed incoming cards now they've even put rtx 3070
[2046.74 --> 2052.74]  numbers in here which is interesting because rtx 3070 has not launched and the embargo hasn't lifted
[2052.74 --> 2058.96]  yet but they apparently pre-ordered 4 330 i mean they might as well have just pre-ordered 40 000 for
[2058.96 --> 2066.82]  all it matters like they're only going to get however many they get they only got 206 counting those that
[2066.82 --> 2078.76]  are incoming um 4.8 fulfillment rate baby doing well oh so these early figures indicate that nvidia's
[2078.76 --> 2086.00]  stock situation may not have improved since uh the delay of the rtx 3070 and it's funny because that
[2086.00 --> 2090.62]  was like wasn't that why they said they were delaying the rtx 3070 so that they could build up more stock
[2090.62 --> 2096.54]  yeah and like again the funny thing is like rtx 3070 is a completely different gpu like it's not
[2096.54 --> 2100.96]  even a ga102 it's a ga i don't know if this is public information
[2100.96 --> 2112.26]  tech power up says it is a ga104 um i think no tech power up does not say that uh let's find someone
[2112.26 --> 2120.66]  who says it is videocards.com says the 3070 mobile ah dang it okay videocards.net i just need someone
[2120.66 --> 2128.74]  i can cite here yeah videocards.net says that the 3070 is a ga104 gpu there you go um so it's a
[2128.74 --> 2135.62]  completely different gpu now it is built on the same eight nanometer samsung process according to
[2135.62 --> 2141.86]  videocards.net here see look there it's on there see look look it's on there that's the four eight
[2141.86 --> 2147.10]  nanometer process okay right there it's plain as plain as the nose on my face and that's that's a
[2147.10 --> 2154.78]  substantial size nose luke let me tell you um and so it's you could argue that you could argue it two
[2154.78 --> 2159.52]  ways you could say okay well i can see why they can't deliver any 3080s because they're busy shipping
[2159.52 --> 2166.72]  all the ga102s as 3090s which cost twice as much or whatever um and then you could say you know with
[2166.72 --> 2171.82]  3070 well there's no excuse because all the good ga104 should just go straight into 3070s
[2171.82 --> 2178.50]  but the thing is because it's built on the same process node from samsung however much
[2178.50 --> 2184.58]  eight nanometer waferage they've managed to get booked is pretty much the bottleneck for how many
[2184.58 --> 2191.10]  of these cards total they can actually build so what i think this is just a guess this is a total
[2191.10 --> 2196.68]  hot take and it may be just as bad as the one from alex hutchinson earlier but probably not um what i
[2196.68 --> 2203.72]  think is that nvidia delayed the launch of the 3070 so that they could build up inventory of the 3080
[2203.72 --> 2209.90]  and the 3090 i don't think that they've been beavering away building up inventory of 3070
[2209.90 --> 2220.42]  because if i was nvidia and i had any fabs like fab allocation i'd say you print them 3090s baby you
[2220.42 --> 2226.24]  print them 3090s real good and then if you print a bad one yeah we're going to ship that as a 3080 we ship
[2226.24 --> 2235.00]  as many of these as we possibly can because rtx 3070 is supposed to be let me just make sure uh msrp
[2235.00 --> 2246.42]  blah blah blah according to tom's guide it's going to be 500 making it a far far smaller transaction
[2246.42 --> 2250.74]  from nvidia standpoint now because you want to maintain a good relationship with your customers
[2250.74 --> 2255.20]  you definitely do want to ship some of these i can just see why they wanted to give themselves a
[2255.20 --> 2260.50]  little bit of time it is pretty clear to me at this point that nvidia went super aggressive on
[2260.50 --> 2265.36]  their rtx 3000 pricing knowing full well that they were not going to be able to ship enough of them
[2265.36 --> 2273.10]  just as a gigantic f*** to sony microsoft and amd because there is no reason why they couldn't have
[2273.10 --> 2278.76]  charged 20 more for these 30 more for them you can see it people are paying that price on ebay people are
[2278.76 --> 2283.86]  desperate for something to finally run their games faster it's been so long if you're a high-end
[2283.86 --> 2288.82]  consumer um that they could have pretty much charged whatever they wanted for them but it's
[2288.82 --> 2292.68]  very clear that they came in at these prices knowing they weren't going to have enough out of the gate
[2292.68 --> 2297.92]  because they wanted to put pressure on their competition and the problem is that if i'm nvidia
[2297.92 --> 2304.50]  i can't launch them at a high price today and then drop my price six weeks later eight weeks later when
[2304.50 --> 2309.58]  the new consoles launch or when amd launches a competitor because then i look reactionary
[2309.58 --> 2316.32]  so nvidia pretty much had to shoot themselves in the foot to avoid shooting themselves in the face
[2316.32 --> 2322.40]  if you think about it from like a thousand foot strategic view yeah
[2322.40 --> 2330.02]  i kind of feel bad for jensen i mean not really because i think he has a new leather jacket for
[2330.02 --> 2334.20]  every day of the week yeah i was gonna say i think that's a pretty difficult person to feel bad
[2334.20 --> 2340.04]  i think his kitchen kitchen costs as much as my house but yeah it's a nice kitchen you seen that
[2340.04 --> 2345.82]  kitchen just the oven dude you've seen that kitchen just the just the what looks like the marble backdrop
[2345.82 --> 2354.90]  to the oven carved by by ancient by nymphs nymphs yeah i think just that might cost as much as like
[2354.90 --> 2360.84]  i don't know definitely my apartment um all right now something to bear in mind about all of these
[2360.84 --> 2366.72]  figures is that nvidia's uh is that europe has largely gotten the short end of the stick with
[2366.72 --> 2372.48]  respect to rtx 3000 series allocation apparently allegedly and it's important to keep in mind that
[2372.48 --> 2379.10]  denmark itself is relatively tiny with a population of just 5.8 million as of 2019 but the orders were
[2379.10 --> 2384.02]  placed i don't know if that's very relevant oh yeah it's relevant it's relevant
[2384.02 --> 2388.58]  why would the population of the area be relevant versus the orders placed
[2388.58 --> 2398.22]  um because what i can tell you is that coming from a retailer in a relatively small region because
[2398.22 --> 2404.68]  compared to china or the u.s canada is a relatively small region absolutely yeah the kinds of orders
[2404.68 --> 2410.94]  that we would place would be very different from what someone like a new egg would place so in the
[2410.94 --> 2418.38]  same way we might order you know okay so let's look at pro shop so canada was a um hold on a second
[2418.38 --> 2426.86]  i'm getting teams messages here bug me monday please don't message right now it pings the whole when show
[2426.86 --> 2439.30]  smiley face uh okay so canada right so we might order 5000 units of rtx 3090 we might try to backorder
[2439.30 --> 2446.02]  5 000 units by comparison someone like a new egg might have 80 000 units on backorder
[2446.90 --> 2452.58]  totally different scale so but do you think that would affect so you think that would affect the
[2452.58 --> 2460.66]  fulfillment rate of those orders though i think that i think that it can have a weight because if
[2460.66 --> 2467.62]  because here's what you got to understand in the event that all of a sudden nvidia suddenly magically
[2467.62 --> 2474.82]  figures out their production and they actually ship you 2000 gpus you have to be able to sell them
[2475.94 --> 2483.30]  right so there's a number of factors at play here one is how many you want to order to indicate your
[2483.30 --> 2491.62]  you know what you think you can sell right how many nvidia actually thinks you can sell and remember
[2491.62 --> 2497.30]  that they they have a ton a ton of historical data to go on because these are retailers that they'll
[2497.30 --> 2501.78]  have been working with for years sure board partners that they've been working with for years and even
[2501.78 --> 2506.90]  going back to when when i was in the business um this is not the kind of thing that nvidia will just
[2506.90 --> 2512.82]  leave to their board partners like an asus msi gigabyte and inno 3d like nvidia particularly right
[2512.82 --> 2519.54]  at launch is going in and hand allocating based on who they think can actually move the inventory who
[2519.54 --> 2525.06]  they think is strategically more important from like a like a marketing and visibility standpoint
[2525.06 --> 2529.06]  i was i was actually gonna i was gonna try to bring that up because i i bet you despite this
[2529.06 --> 2534.50]  literally happening and this is evidence that is going to be against what i'm gonna say i would suspect
[2534.50 --> 2541.54]  the american slash north american crowd would probably be a little bit more screechy about these types of
[2541.54 --> 2547.78]  problems than a lot of other uh demographics and so you might want to allocate to them a little bit more
[2547.78 --> 2553.62]  because of that and even within a region you might find particular customers that are going to be louder
[2553.62 --> 2560.10]  and more upset and or make more sense to support like your system integrators nvidia has a long and storage
[2560.10 --> 2566.58]  history of making sure that system integrators who rather than making selling you know you know one card
[2566.58 --> 2573.38]  are selling an entire gaming experience to who is effectively an nvidia customer at the end at the end of the day
[2573.38 --> 2578.50]  um you could make the argument that those are those are more important those are more timely because
[2578.50 --> 2583.78]  whoever's ordering an individual card presumably already has a graphics card of some sort whereas
[2583.78 --> 2588.90]  someone ordering a full system may not actually have a functioning system so there's all kinds of
[2588.90 --> 2594.10]  factors that come into play when they're deciding how to do these things i remember one of them being
[2594.10 --> 2602.42]  um i can't remember what card this was uh and yeah whatever i'm whatever nda i signed it ncix i can't
[2602.42 --> 2611.46]  imagine it still applies but um i remember this one time when i think this was in the fermi days so this would be um
[2613.62 --> 2620.90]  was it 480 or something like that maybe it was maybe it was 285 i don't remember it was a period of time
[2620.90 --> 2628.74]  where nvidia was not particularly competitive um and what they essentially wanted us to do
[2629.70 --> 2636.42]  must have been must have been 280 or 285 i am i'm sorry i it escapes me when exactly it was it was a
[2636.42 --> 2642.18]  time when nvidia wasn't particularly competitive in the mid-range and they basically were like
[2643.06 --> 2649.38]  you can order you're allowed to order a hundred of these like cards everyone wants but you have to
[2649.38 --> 2658.50]  take like 600 of these ones that like nobody wants and i was like um okay but like how am i gonna sell
[2658.50 --> 2664.66]  600 like 9600 gs's or whatever i don't i don't remember what it was i really wish that i did because
[2664.66 --> 2673.38]  i was like how on earth am i gonna move these like you guys know back at ncix like we we would sell
[2673.38 --> 2679.46]  we would buy a unit count we would sell more of an 800 graphics card than an 80 graphics card because
[2679.46 --> 2685.86]  it just wasn't our business meanwhile the best buy right down the street would sell 20 to one of that
[2685.86 --> 2692.34]  80 card versus the 800 card it's just different customers different expectations we i i worked at
[2692.34 --> 2698.82]  that best bite on the street we did not move the expensive cards like ever exactly it collected dust
[2698.82 --> 2705.94]  exactly so i i remember that sometimes allocation of a product you want is dependent on how much you
[2705.94 --> 2710.66]  can move of a product that nvidia is trying to get rid of now nvidia hasn't been in a position where
[2710.66 --> 2715.38]  they've had to really get rid of anything in like many years now they've had a lot they've ridden from
[2715.38 --> 2721.46]  one success to another but i know that that used to affect things so there's the relationship there's the
[2721.46 --> 2728.58]  uh the optics from like a an outsider standpoint of like who should be getting cards there's the history
[2728.58 --> 2733.78]  there's the you know how much are they how much are they scratching your back how much do you want
[2733.78 --> 2738.74]  to scratch their back it's business it's business guys it's not as simple as like well i placed an
[2738.74 --> 2744.10]  order so i should get it um and this is the kind of stuff that consumers can't and shouldn't have to
[2744.10 --> 2750.50]  care about but at the end of the day if you want to understand what's going on you just you sort of
[2750.50 --> 2755.06]  have to what do you want me to tell you that i mean yeah those those are going to be the things
[2755.06 --> 2761.22]  that you are suddenly concerned with now that these numbers were published um i wonder how uh
[2761.22 --> 2765.78]  their oh their order and get filled after publishing this information uh probably not too
[2765.78 --> 2771.06]  great do you want a pro tip by the way guys if you want to get a card one of the best ways to get
[2771.06 --> 2778.26]  one is instead of queuing up for a skew that already exists wait for a new launch of like uh asus is
[2778.26 --> 2783.94]  doing a gundam edition card for example you will pay more but it'll cost you less than scalping one
[2783.94 --> 2788.82]  of the other ones on ebay and you will probably get you know a brand new card with a warranty from a
[2788.82 --> 2795.86]  retailer um versus having to wait for it so waiting around for like a kingpin edition or ftw
[2796.74 --> 2804.18]  76 super clock plus ko whatever their stupid suffixes are now over at evga so if you wait around for a new
[2804.18 --> 2809.78]  skew launch typically if i'm in asus or an evga or gigabyte or whatever i'm squirreling away enough
[2809.78 --> 2816.02]  gpus so that i can do a launch even though i know that it's going to sell it right away and i had i
[2816.02 --> 2822.66]  saw people just order like the wrong skew and just sit in the queue like forever especially if it's an
[2822.66 --> 2829.06]  entry level one because if i'm an evga you know what's my higher priority i want to fill every customer
[2829.06 --> 2834.10]  order and i will eventually fill your order i promise but am i going which one am i going to
[2834.10 --> 2844.58]  prioritize more you know an ftw3 acs cooler super super super clock that i make you know 60 or 70
[2844.58 --> 2851.70]  dollars on or a base model one at the basic nvidia suggested msrp where i make like 35 bucks a card
[2852.50 --> 2854.90]  well probably the one that keeps my business running right
[2854.90 --> 2859.86]  what do you want that's just the reality of it there's not a lot of margin in this for board
[2859.86 --> 2864.50]  partners that's how everything is going to work at like every company ever yeah and even the ones
[2864.50 --> 2872.10]  that by and large have you know a strong ethical base to them and and really care about their
[2872.10 --> 2878.10]  customers and love their customers they still have to keep the doors open so they have to do
[2878.10 --> 2884.58]  both but there's going to be priority levels on things of course of course all right what else
[2884.58 --> 2889.54]  we want to talk about today we have only gotten through two topics i blame luke he talked for
[2889.54 --> 2895.70]  so long about that first one i could barely get a word in ed that luke he's always talking so much
[2897.30 --> 2904.90]  i i i was ripping through that thing uh we've got some alleged rx 6800 xt benchmarks these are from video
[2904.90 --> 2914.42]  cards now they're not actual games which means that like who cares but these
[2914.42 --> 2923.54]  they're super lame but it's still kind of cool you know go ahead keep talking luke no no i i want you
[2923.54 --> 2929.62]  to i want you to just i i i i don't like that they're actual games i i don't like that it's like
[2929.62 --> 2938.50]  time spy fire strike and and uh what's the other one port royal something port royal yeah because yeah i
[2938.50 --> 2945.30]  i remember port 3d mark boat i think you're thinking of aqua mark and it's a submarine
[2946.02 --> 2952.98]  there's your there's your new idea uh 3d mark just make one called boat um but yeah no yeah there you
[2952.98 --> 2960.98]  go perfect do it um i'd benchmark my computer on that guaranteed uh yeah it it does i mean it does well
[2960.98 --> 2967.46]  it it it crushes in fire strike ultra it it it succeeds quite strongly in time spy and then you
[2967.46 --> 2970.42]  know it doesn't do that great in port royal but if i remember correctly port royal is like
[2971.22 --> 2980.18]  entirely ray tracing based so i think hopefully it's good yeah i don't know i'm still maybe the whole
[2980.18 --> 2986.58]  all red computer thing is is more legit than than i had potentially thought and i think honestly
[2986.58 --> 2993.86]  as long as amd doesn't like trip fall and smash their face with this launch i think it'll be great
[2993.86 --> 2999.22]  because people will they'll look like good guys yeah they'll they'll look like good guys they'll be
[2999.22 --> 3006.10]  able to sell cards because no one else can buy the other cards yeah so like hooray they they just need to
[3007.06 --> 3014.26]  not yeah they need to not completely fumble the launch and then i believe in amd good yeah but i
[3014.26 --> 3018.82]  believe in them both ways i believe that they cannot fumble a launch and i believe that they
[3018.82 --> 3022.90]  can hard fumble a launch i love those guys but they've made they've done some doofus stuff over
[3022.90 --> 3028.98]  the years um this is an interesting one tyler witt says and do you follow the logic here tyler
[3028.98 --> 3033.54]  witt in the youtube chat says this is not pre-recorded look at how oily their hair is
[3035.46 --> 3039.78]  my hair's not oily oh mine is but i still don't follow the logic
[3039.78 --> 3047.38]  because my hair is oily this couldn't possibly be pre-recorded i guess he's saying like if we were
[3047.38 --> 3053.22]  going to pre-record it we would put enough prep in to like wash our hair which is a misguided
[3053.22 --> 3058.58]  statement yeah that's he clearly doesn't know us at all like yeah that's not a thing that i would do
[3058.58 --> 3068.26]  um all right intel has sold their nand storage unit to sk hynix uh in march 2020 intel cfo george davis
[3068.26 --> 3072.34]  said the company was unable to sell enough ssds to make a profit from the 3d nan chips it made at
[3072.34 --> 3077.14]  its dalian china factory said they were exploring options such as closing the factory and buying
[3077.14 --> 3081.54]  chips from others selling chips to third parties and buying ssds from a third party they've reached
[3081.54 --> 3087.86]  a deal to sell their flash memory business to sk hynix for about nine billion dollars billion dollars
[3087.86 --> 3092.34]  so they'll be getting the majority of intel's memory business plus the memory manufacturing options in
[3092.34 --> 3098.10]  dalin they will not be getting the optane division so optane clearly has more margin in it and
[3098.10 --> 3105.62]  intel held on to it so market share was about 11 this will give hynix roughly 20 market share
[3105.62 --> 3113.30]  overall compared to samsung at 31 kiosya at 17. sk hynix does have a 15 stake in kiosya though wd at 16
[3113.30 --> 3118.98]  and micron at 13.7 i'm actually pretty surprised at how big wd's stake is
[3118.98 --> 3128.74]  yeah i'm not because remember they bought uh sandisk way back oh yeah okay so that's all sandisk it's
[3128.74 --> 3136.02]  nothing to do with like conventional wd like spinning rust business oh oh speaking of conventional business
[3136.02 --> 3143.86]  lttsstore.com so we actually got two of our winners from the stealth pins shirt giveaway you're not by any
[3143.86 --> 3150.10]  chance wearing a stealth pins shirt are you no bummer okay oh you're wearing gpu all right oh
[3150.10 --> 3157.38]  you know what shirt i'm wearing float plane nice nice i put it on this morning i was like you know
[3157.38 --> 3161.86]  what we should do a big shout out for float plane over on the uh wan show today so that's what i meant
[3161.86 --> 3166.82]  we should and we have a specific shout out for float plane we do but first first i need to tell
[3166.82 --> 3172.26]  people to make sure they're subscribed because i've got a big announcement ladies and gentlemen's
[3172.26 --> 3180.82]  secret shopper is back was that too loud did i clip it cli it uh i tried i tried to move away from
[3180.82 --> 3188.74]  the mic it got rid of the audio oh okay well secret shopper is back baby secret shopper is coming for
[3188.74 --> 3194.90]  you uh and it's too late for any of the system integrators to do anything about it we have already
[3194.90 --> 3202.10]  gone through our entire purchase process we have already gone through our tech support challenge um
[3202.10 --> 3209.46]  the system integrators that are included this year are i buy power cyber power dell hp main gear and
[3209.46 --> 3216.18]  origin pc so we are going to see what if anything these system builders have learned in the last two
[3216.18 --> 3221.38]  years let me tell you right away spoiler alert some of them learned a lot some of them learned a whole
[3221.38 --> 3222.66]  lot of nothing
[3222.66 --> 3232.50]  some of them got worse which is shocking considering which ones got worse so you are going to see those
[3232.50 --> 3238.82]  videos early over on floatplane.com not to mention that we've got uh yeah that's right we're gonna have
[3238.82 --> 3244.82]  them windowed um so they're gonna be coming probably sometime in the next uh couple of few weeks here or
[3244.82 --> 3252.74]  so jake's been hard at work on this season uh i am going to be agent double oh six point nine we are
[3252.74 --> 3262.82]  going for a bond theme this year um david and uh jake have been hard at work making it fun so we i posted
[3262.82 --> 3271.22]  a very small tweez tease tweezer teaser a while back on social media of like a poker table so like that's one of
[3271.22 --> 3278.42]  the sets for it we're doing like uh like a casino kind of casino royale style yeah yeah uh so it's
[3278.42 --> 3284.50]  going to be a lot of fun um i take it you guys are done filming we are done filming yeah well we're not
[3284.50 --> 3290.10]  done filming we're not done filming the like uh done the whole ordering process the whole ordering and tech
[3290.10 --> 3297.22]  support process so cool it's too late for any of these system integrators to have any say good in what
[3297.22 --> 3302.10]  happens or to you know beef up their phone lines or anything because they know secret shoppers happen
[3302.10 --> 3309.38]  it's been so long i guarantee you some of them like totally got complacent um anyway so yeah guys get
[3309.38 --> 3315.78]  subscribed on flow plane early access uh when we get to it and also uh some like exclusive behind the
[3315.78 --> 3321.38]  scenes stuff you know what the funny part is about the secret shopper part yeah i i haven't talked about
[3321.38 --> 3328.42]  you guys doing that in a long time but in the last two weeks i have had two people talk to me and be
[3328.42 --> 3333.86]  like i know i know i know i know but i'm not going to build it myself also i want a 3000 series and this
[3333.86 --> 3339.70]  is a pretty decent way to get one etc etc etc i'm doing a pre-build do you have any suggestions and i've
[3339.70 --> 3344.02]  linked them the secret shopper series i've been like it's a little out of date but you should still
[3344.02 --> 3348.74]  like check this out and now you're updating it that's fantastic yep we've been meaning to do it for
[3348.74 --> 3355.62]  it we meant to make it an annual thing so it clearly took us a hot minute to uh to get to that
[3356.18 --> 3363.54]  but uh derby smith asks can we get a float plane shirt um when we get the creator warehouse and float
[3363.54 --> 3368.82]  plane integration working we will totally be able to do like little exclusive merch drops and stuff
[3369.78 --> 3376.42]  yeah um we'll be able to do that uh but right now we're just not set up for it so yeah sorry about
[3376.42 --> 3382.42]  that we will though um right so the other thing i wanted to say stealth pins so our cpu stealth pins
[3382.42 --> 3390.10]  shirt on lttstore.com where let me just pull i'll just pull it up here uh this one right here there
[3390.10 --> 3396.50]  are a handful of these out there so see how there's kind of like an ltt logo in the pins there are three
[3396.50 --> 3403.78]  of these out there that do not say ltt if you got one of them you want a gaming system all you got to
[3403.78 --> 3410.34]  do is reach out to the ltt store support prove to them that you got one that doesn't say ltt and
[3410.34 --> 3413.94]  they're going to know what it says so you're not going to be able to fake it with photoshop
[3413.94 --> 3422.34]  um and you will get a corsair vengeance gaming pc equipped with a core i7 10 850k rtx 3080 32 gigs of
[3422.34 --> 3428.82]  memory a one terabyte m.2 with two terabytes of spinning rust so two of them have been claimed but
[3428.82 --> 3436.18]  one of them is still out there so if you bought a stealth pin cpu shirt guys well let's go boys
[3436.18 --> 3441.78]  go check your shirt don't wait just run go look at it now see if it says ltt or not it's not mine
[3441.78 --> 3446.26]  because i i technically never got one um yeah no and we wouldn't have given it to you like but
[3446.26 --> 3454.26]  he also also i kind of alluded to this before but i can't guarantee you know if we'll ever do anything
[3454.26 --> 3461.30]  like this again or whatever but we did another giveaway stealthily stealthily so the foil t-shirt
[3461.30 --> 3469.22]  which i think sold out to wanshow viewers um not miss prince by the way sorry miss prince you guys
[3469.22 --> 3476.42]  you paid half price for your shirt but there were no prize ones mixed in so we have randomly selected
[3476.42 --> 3482.34]  winners from our foil keyboard shirt buyers so if you notice something weird about your order when it
[3482.34 --> 3488.74]  arrives reach out to support and there may be an awesome surprise in store for you very cool some
[3488.74 --> 3497.38]  of them some of the foils might be different colors to indicate something or other oh let's see what they
[3497.38 --> 3504.90]  are um all right is there anything else we really want to talk about paypal to support cryptocurrencies
[3504.90 --> 3512.98]  wow i want to talk about uh uh uh a new a new floatplane entry sure yeah we actually have two new
[3512.98 --> 3521.14]  floatplane entries craft tv crap sorry oh my god craft tv i just merged both the names together what a bad guy
[3522.42 --> 3530.34]  lawn tv and craft computing two different creators not one creator that i zombified together have both joined
[3530.34 --> 3535.70]  uh a floatplane very recently check out craft computing i know you guys did a collab together
[3535.70 --> 3541.06]  recently we did that's actually very serendipitous timing because i had i don't think i even knew you
[3541.06 --> 3545.86]  were working on that i'm working on things man they're coming together i didn't say not working
[3545.86 --> 3551.30]  on things i just said i didn't know you're working on that yeah yeah and he he's actually one of the
[3551.30 --> 3557.78]  the first oh he has 17 subs already he has his numbers public that's pretty cool cool um he he is one
[3557.78 --> 3565.38]  of the first creators to use the multi-content post feature so he has one video that is actually six
[3565.38 --> 3573.46]  videos pretty cool yeah check it out all right uh let me just see if there's anything else ea is
[3573.46 --> 3578.50]  getting sued for loot boxes in canada class action lawsuit saying ea has been profiting off of an
[3578.50 --> 3583.54]  illegal gambling business by selling random loot boxes for cash get wrecked yeah that sounds about right
[3583.54 --> 3587.62]  similar to a suit in california that says fifa's ultimate team mode is effectively gambling
[3588.26 --> 3595.30]  yep sounds about right it's about time the thing is like why did why did game developers and
[3595.30 --> 3601.06]  publishers why did they have to push the limit like if they had just if they had just chilled a little
[3601.06 --> 3608.82]  bit you know if they had just kept it small instead of being the thing that funds game development
[3609.86 --> 3614.58]  they could have gotten away with it if it wasn't there was darn kids gambling there was the kids who are
[3614.58 --> 3620.74]  gambling that are like i think i think genuinely very accepted by the majority of the community
[3620.74 --> 3624.26]  like i don't know these days i know there's been some changes to the store and how it works and stuff
[3624.26 --> 3630.34]  but i don't know how it works i don't play anymore but um league of legends at its inception had some
[3630.34 --> 3636.90]  like negative feedback at first because they were honestly pretty early on the the like micro transactions
[3636.90 --> 3642.18]  game um but everyone was usually okay with it it was a free game and you could buy some skins for
[3642.18 --> 3648.26]  heroes that you cared about and whatever else like that was that was pretty accepted but in games like
[3648.90 --> 3655.38]  especially mmos where you have to like pay for the box and for expansions and monthly and they have a
[3655.38 --> 3661.46]  cash shop for for games where you have to pay like full fat like 60 70 bucks for the game and there's
[3661.46 --> 3668.50]  content that was like clearly held from being like a cool quest reward or something in the game and has
[3668.50 --> 3674.74]  now been put into a cash shop like that kind of stuff is just ridiculous and like you you know that
[3674.74 --> 3680.34]  it's negatively affecting the game to a certain degree because because a lot of this stuff is like
[3680.34 --> 3686.58]  some of the best art assets that they have and it could have like definitely been some like cool reward
[3686.58 --> 3692.58]  for accomplishing something whatever it is but instead it's like nope 20 bucks or more
[3693.70 --> 3698.66]  aj and float plane chat says hey you should really show the float plane page for craft computing so i'm
[3698.66 --> 3705.70]  gonna do that there you go float plane page that's what it looks like got the subscribers up in there
[3705.70 --> 3713.14]  got the tiers over in there uh there you go that's what that's supposed to look like hey there you go aj
[3713.14 --> 3722.42]  sorry about that all right um yeah you're getting this man designs mcbroken a site that displays all
[3722.42 --> 3728.58]  the broken ice cream machines in all mcdonald's a site that shows you where mcdonald's ice cream
[3728.58 --> 3735.62]  machines are broken so you don't accidentally go to one that has a broken thing interesting so
[3736.18 --> 3742.58]  the developer rashik zahid came up with mcbroken after realizing that the online order site can be used to
[3742.58 --> 3747.46]  determine if their ice cream machine is working or not if you can't order a cone it's broken he
[3747.46 --> 3751.86]  then exploited that flaw and wrote a bot that tries to order an ice cream cone at every mcdonald's in
[3751.86 --> 3760.98]  the usa and reports back onto a map that is hilarious uh this comes after much trial and error initially
[3760.98 --> 3766.26]  he created an api that attempted to add a mc sunday from every mcdonald's location to its cart once every
[3766.26 --> 3770.58]  minute and the app figured out what he was up to and blocked him he then determined he can make an
[3770.58 --> 3776.02]  or an api call sorry he then determined that he can make an api call every 30 minutes undetected so
[3776.02 --> 3782.42]  he now has a bot that can tell the real-time ice cream status twice an hour um that's hilarious
[3783.38 --> 3792.74]  it's amazing that 7.16 of all of them are down and like certain areas like i wonder if this correlates
[3792.74 --> 3799.06]  with how many uh like how much ice cream is being sold and i wonder if you can compare that
[3799.70 --> 3804.10]  to like how hot it is in that area so how much people are looking for like cold refreshments
[3804.10 --> 3810.50]  but yeah phoenix arizona 15.56 of ice cream machines are down that's so frustrating because
[3810.50 --> 3815.14]  like i've gone to mcdonald's for the express purpose of getting an ice cream because like i don't know what
[3815.14 --> 3820.74]  the heck else you would eat there and the ice cream machine's been broken and like yeah i'm choked
[3820.74 --> 3829.14]  like i'm choked it is a bit of a meme like it it does happen a lot so yeah high areas
[3829.78 --> 3833.70]  scrolling in on the map of phoenix and seeing how many red dots there are is kind of crazy actually
[3834.42 --> 3839.30]  let's go ahead and get through a few super chats and then we're gonna call it uh robert mail says the
[3839.30 --> 3846.74]  riaa is coming for your github repos downloading videos is now circumvention of technological protection
[3846.74 --> 3859.62]  measures oh okay uh philip says hey hey philip what's up mona lisa uh brandon no i cannot adopt
[3859.62 --> 3865.30]  you sorry andre says the first time i catch wanshow live at almost 3 a.m here in italy well you've
[3865.30 --> 3870.10]  probably gone to bed now by the time i read your super chat sorry about that uh daniel woods says
[3870.10 --> 3880.34]  message retracted way to go daniel nice yeah still a great thing anyway uh janko flex says up in the
[3880.34 --> 3884.18]  middle of the night here in sweden with my four day old son he seems to like the show as well as
[3884.18 --> 3889.46]  his older sister keep it up you're my daughter's favorite youtube star all right thank you nice
[3890.02 --> 3894.90]  nader i love that twitch streamers are trying to say they're promoting the songs and saying dmca is a
[3894.90 --> 3899.70]  group of people not a law welcome to real copyright policy which is what youtube has had for years yeah
[3899.70 --> 3903.38]  yeah streamers who think that they're going to be able to get away with songs yeah you got away with
[3903.38 --> 3910.74]  the whole game thing feel lucky i agree with that aspect of uh of uh what's what's his name's uh
[3911.86 --> 3919.54]  there is there is so i don't take i i i i i'm not feeling it this much for songs but there is some
[3919.54 --> 3924.74]  argument there and there have some there have been some artists that have that have come out and
[3924.74 --> 3929.22]  either directly worked with their publisher to make sure that it's okay to play their songs on twitch
[3929.22 --> 3936.26]  or um expressed that they don't agree with how their publisher is treating it because um
[3937.14 --> 3942.98]  especially streamers that accredit properly and like will show like a shop uh spotify thing in the
[3942.98 --> 3947.78]  bottom corner it'll show what's currently playing etc i could see that as being good promotion
[3947.78 --> 3954.50]  or a link whatever because it's all about what's the impact on the original work right yes but if
[3954.50 --> 3959.70]  you're making it so that because like if i if i go to a stream and there's a song playing and i dig it
[3959.70 --> 3966.98]  and i can't relatively easily figure out what that song is that's silly um unless they have the rights to
[3966.98 --> 3974.34]  do that um but i think if they're like actively promoting the music as an if i was a musician i would
[3974.34 --> 3979.46]  probably want that to happen because i don't gain anything from it not being played and i don't
[3979.46 --> 3984.26]  think there's any opportunity cost there i don't think someone's gonna go well i'm gonna watch this
[3984.26 --> 3990.02]  streamer because i can listen to this specific song instead of watching it on youtube where it's almost
[3990.02 --> 3996.66]  certainly gonna be and also be free or somewhere else like i i honestly i in general i don't agree with
[3996.66 --> 4002.66]  the music argument and i think in it almost every case as long as it's properly attributed the music
[4002.66 --> 4008.58]  artist is gaining quite a bit by being on twitch but the same as the game argument it's still in
[4008.58 --> 4012.42]  their court and they should be able to make that decision i think they are improperly making that
[4012.42 --> 4017.30]  decision but they should be able to make that decision and it comes down to precedent right like
[4017.30 --> 4024.34]  the music industry hasn't set this precedent that you're just like allowed to use music in your in your
[4025.06 --> 4031.30]  in your other art they do not consider me like you know you can't make a movie and be like yeah we're
[4031.30 --> 4036.02]  gonna we're gonna put playing with the boys in our movie and it's transformative enough because
[4037.06 --> 4043.14]  our movie is you know the art and this is just supplemental like music has been considered
[4045.30 --> 4053.46]  integral as as part of the greater viewing experience of whatever other type of medium it's integrated with
[4054.10 --> 4060.50]  in such a way that's really poorly worded the point is music has never been seen as having been
[4060.50 --> 4068.90]  transformed by visuals set to it it has never worked that way so there's no precedent for them to have to
[4068.90 --> 4076.98]  give in in this way and the other part is that while game developers are directly off their customers by
[4076.98 --> 4084.82]  not allowing twitch streamers to play the games on stream music labels don't seem to see it that way
[4084.82 --> 4091.22]  even though if they're making the argument that people listening to it on the stream is digging into
[4091.22 --> 4096.42]  their sales then they do understand they're their customers i don't know i don't know maybe they think
[4096.42 --> 4104.74]  that yeah i think a lot of music labels are treating this improperly for uh in regards to their
[4104.74 --> 4108.82]  own benefit and i think they would be much better off if they actually let the streamers play the
[4108.82 --> 4116.90]  songs um but but that's yeah that's their thing you know they can they can make the wrong decision
[4116.90 --> 4123.94]  there as much as they want uh cyrus sear says hashtag undertale also since nvidia screwed canada for
[4123.94 --> 4128.90]  the founders edition how do you feel doing something like selling gpus on lttstore.com you know we've
[4128.90 --> 4134.82]  talked about it we've talked about just like turning lttstore.com into a computer parts shop
[4134.82 --> 4140.10]  um so far we're not going to do that anytime soon uh samad says if you're worried your game will stop
[4140.10 --> 4143.54]  selling because streamers playing it maybe the gameplay part is not fun it's just a bunch of
[4143.54 --> 4148.90]  cut scenes tied together with bandages by that logic movies are just a bunch of cut scenes and yeah
[4150.90 --> 4155.22]  that's a terrible take i can't believe you spent 200 whatever those are to tell me that
[4155.22 --> 4162.90]  a game despite being called a game doesn't actually have to sell entirely off of its gameplay there are
[4162.90 --> 4170.02]  a lot of games that are cinematically beautiful narratively beautiful yep uh voiced very well really
[4170.02 --> 4175.86]  good music music speaking it can be quite an experience and the whole point could be the experience
[4175.86 --> 4182.98]  and it's still a great game yeah yeah by that logic you know i shouldn't make any i should i shouldn't let
[4182.98 --> 4188.42]  people just replay my videos on twitch because the gameplay isn't fun and so no one will buy my video
[4188.42 --> 4192.74]  like what are you talking about um nicholas says i've been pondering putting a tv in my bathroom like
[4192.74 --> 4197.14]  you my question is that my tub is in a full wet room with an enclosed shower and i'm worried about
