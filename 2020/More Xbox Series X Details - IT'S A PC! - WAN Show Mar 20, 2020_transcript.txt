[0.00 --> 10.74]  very live welcome ladies and gentlemen to the WAN show I actually had the best day ever you're
[10.74 --> 18.12]  lying no no no really so for me it's not about how my day was because my day was terrible I heard a
[18.12 --> 24.24]  lot of swearing yeah there was oh yeah I guess I heard like a loud swear I like I thought someone
[24.24 --> 30.66]  like got their toes smashed or something uh no so what happened there was I actually spilled water
[30.66 --> 40.30]  um into the underside of the back plate of not one but multiple gpus that are all um attached
[40.30 --> 46.26]  together with this big like manifold the so the the gpu stack of titan v's yeah when they're all
[46.26 --> 52.56]  attached that way they're not cheap gpus and they're not easy to get at and dry out um that
[52.56 --> 58.78]  towers like this big you just like rock it like drain yeah it was it was that was not a lot of
[58.78 --> 64.48]  fun but the reason that today was a great day got your stress ball here stress ball going the reason
[64.48 --> 70.80]  today was a great day was that we came through in the end that's all that matters to me that video
[70.80 --> 76.60]  is done yeah but we were supposed to do another one that video is we were supposed to do two more
[76.60 --> 83.82]  but that video is done wait no we're supposed to get seven and we got six uh right yeah so we're
[83.82 --> 91.56]  good and that video is done and and and it's for a good cause and I have more good news so this is a
[91.56 --> 95.82]  bit of a spoiler for the video sorry I keep creeping closer to James I'm trying to maintain our one to
[95.82 --> 101.46]  two meters here anyway um so uh this is a bit of a spoiler for the video but it's like an ultimate
[101.46 --> 108.26]  folding at home uh machine so we're using the six workstations one cpu rig to run folding at home
[108.26 --> 112.68]  and it's also kind of like a quick and easy guide for how you guys can get set up folding
[112.68 --> 117.42]  preferably of course for the ltt folding team but it actually doesn't matter that much as long as
[117.42 --> 122.68]  you're folding uh the folding project is contributing to the covid19 pandemic right now so
[122.68 --> 128.56]  it's totally a good cause contributing to combating it yes thank you it's a friday we got all weekend to
[128.56 --> 133.74]  set our machines up so remember to do that yeah I have to admit I haven't set mine up it even has
[133.74 --> 139.32]  it has a setting in the app so that you can tell it don't operate when I'm actually using my computer
[139.32 --> 144.04]  because well that used to be a problem where you would set it to a low priority but it would still
[144.04 --> 149.04]  kind of derp when you're trying to play a game and stuff so now it's just you can set it so that
[149.04 --> 153.20]  when your machine's idle it'll run and when it's not it won't run if I already have that folding at
[153.20 --> 157.98]  home app get the latest client oh okay yeah just make sure you get the latest client um
[157.98 --> 163.56]  but uh yeah so what's really cool though is that in us trying to do this what we discovered is that
[163.56 --> 170.36]  the folding project has a big problem the problem is that it's basically 10xed since the covid19 thing
[170.36 --> 176.24]  took off and they've got so many users that are trying to submit completed work units that their
[176.24 --> 182.98]  servers are choking on it so what's awesome is that in doing this project we found this problem
[182.98 --> 190.22]  because we were getting terrible numbers out of six titan v's and 56 cpu cores and we're like what's
[190.22 --> 195.44]  going on and it turns out we weren't able to submit so we actually contacted them and we are working
[195.44 --> 201.14]  with them to roll our own server so what's the flow then we're solving little puzzles yes on our machine
[201.14 --> 208.30]  here and like uh we're solving protein folding uh simulations basically and once they're done you have
[208.30 --> 213.38]  to submit them yes go to the server elsewhere to be like verified or just like put into an archive or
[213.38 --> 218.62]  something exactly where they can actually analyze them and see if the data is useful um so basically
[218.62 --> 224.64]  um they've run out of bandwidth and so we contacted them we're like hey so we want to do this video
[224.64 --> 229.96]  showing this but um we can't even show this ultimate folding rig because we can't submit enough
[229.96 --> 236.74]  work units is there a way for us to set up a folding recipient server here at our office and they
[236.74 --> 244.20]  were like yes so we are so part two of this project which should actually be easier than the one we just
[244.20 --> 248.30]  did because that machine has been sitting in mothballs for ages and was kind of broken but part two is
[248.30 --> 253.18]  we're actually going to be building a server utilizing our 10 gig connection here so we'll partition off a
[253.18 --> 258.24]  big chunk of it and then you need a bunch of storage you need a big fat internet pipe and we will
[258.24 --> 263.88]  actually be able to contribute on the other side of the equation then then no no there's another level
[263.88 --> 269.76]  sir we're pretty set up to do that that's pretty good yeah so we got in touch with our isp to um put
[269.76 --> 275.20]  some security stuff in place to make it so that when we do that it's not going to open us up to um
[275.20 --> 280.42]  just any unnecessary vulnerabilities we're like hey just doing our due diligence let's make sure we're
[280.42 --> 285.00]  doing this right and they go oh wow that sounds like a really cool project we'd love to get involved
[285.00 --> 295.12]  i can't share too many details but there could be a part three where we we 10x it again okay and
[295.12 --> 301.62]  anyway so i'll be at this site or a different site it would be off site here we we can't we can't get a
[301.62 --> 308.48]  hundred gigabit pipe in here i mean maybe we could but we're not wow that's crazy how many servers do
[308.48 --> 316.22]  they have now um i actually don't know like several i i have no idea but my understanding is
[316.22 --> 321.50]  it's multiple servers and they're all just running like gigabit connections yeah so so we would be
[321.50 --> 326.42]  contributing uh so we would be contributing hardware and we'd obviously be trying to find partners to
[326.42 --> 332.08]  help us build up these servers and then our isp is working with some of their partners to help us get
[332.08 --> 337.04]  bandwidth and then i'm trying to work with a drive provider i've reached out to seagate
[337.04 --> 342.62]  um they might be interested to get the storage that we need and then we basically try to have
[342.62 --> 347.04]  these rolled for the next i mean those guys are probably going to want their stuff back eventually
[347.04 --> 352.90]  and you know once there's some big breakthroughs in covid19 we might not need all this computational
[352.90 --> 357.96]  power for that project but um we'd like to keep it rolled out for at least a little while man it'd be
[357.96 --> 364.74]  amazing if this community contributed significantly to a breakthrough like that i mean it has on other
[364.74 --> 369.64]  projects so it's a really important thing like if you're going to use your idle cycles for something
[369.64 --> 377.78]  better that than crypto mining quite frankly um that's wicked oh we should totally talk about what
[377.78 --> 381.82]  we're going to talk about on the show today oh yeah the wham show yeah the wham show hey got him
[381.82 --> 390.00]  uh direct x12 ultimate unveiled xbox series x specs unveiled those two things hand and glove yes
[390.00 --> 394.40]  that's right what else we got gamestop apparently thinks they're an essential service and shouldn't
[394.40 --> 403.04]  have to close lordy that's interesting and uh oh also beware of folding at home phishing and malware
[403.04 --> 410.16]  not the real one so you google folding at home you go to that website the first hit and you download
[410.16 --> 415.16]  the client off there but there have been some scams going around just like this scam rolling our
[415.16 --> 420.30]  intro boom you're just like wired for segways i know right you just can't turn off segway
[420.30 --> 424.10]  my battery never dies james
[424.10 --> 430.12]  rafisa says linus you were on a pulseway ad
[430.12 --> 437.10]  i actually do know that because i was on set for two days oh yeah you were there when they filmed you
[437.10 --> 444.46]  yeah i was there believe it's not true uh that must be going really well for them they seem to have
[444.46 --> 450.98]  put a lot of spend behind that spot sweet uh all right so let's you know what i think one of the
[450.98 --> 455.08]  first things i'd like to address i wasn't on the show last week uh where where the heck was i last
[455.08 --> 462.62]  week what was i doing where were you last week uh i well luke is self-isolating yes because he thought
[462.62 --> 466.72]  he might have been exposed he's well he's a couple of degrees of separation away from somebody who was
[466.72 --> 472.16]  confirmed i think okay god he's so he's playing it safe yeah where the heck were you i don't know
[472.16 --> 478.42]  uh okay it doesn't matter anyway i wasn't on last week so i want to take this opportunity to talk about
[478.42 --> 486.30]  you went home early oh that's right yep i remember where i was so i had a bit of a situation
[486.30 --> 494.06]  with my cat um who got uh it was an accident but um i still consider it to be a fairly negligent
[494.06 --> 500.32]  thing to do the law calls that manslaughter um yeah when it's a man so we call it cat slaughter but
[500.32 --> 508.88]  my cat was was killed um by my my children's caretaker last friday um she accidentally ran him
[508.88 --> 513.56]  through the clothes dryer so if you follow me on twitter you'll already know about that um we did
[513.56 --> 519.52]  our best uh yvonne left work immediately after we found out took him to the vet uh they had him in the
[519.52 --> 525.42]  oxygen chamber and everything like we were just like look he's a young cat quite honestly like
[525.42 --> 531.56]  just do whatever you need to do our vet's really good like they wouldn't send us a you know fifteen
[531.56 --> 538.26]  thousand dollar bill they're they're not idiots but uh in fact our vet is amazing i'm not going to call
[538.26 --> 542.78]  out her name because i don't know if she would want me to she's kind of more of a private person but i
[542.78 --> 549.70]  will say massive shout out to fraser heights animal hospital um those guys are awesome the uh the guy
[549.70 --> 555.40]  that runs it is actually a long long time family friend and his staff is amazing they're they're
[555.40 --> 560.12]  all amazing just great people there but um it was a real test in professionalism because i was
[560.12 --> 565.62]  speaking to the editor we happened to be filming a video while this was unfolding and yvonne left and
[565.62 --> 572.36]  then was messaging linus all these updates of this evolving situation and obviously linus was really
[572.36 --> 578.46]  affected by it but then we kept having to go okay high energy level make a video that people are
[578.46 --> 582.46]  going to want to watch and i spoke to the editor of that video and he was like it was traumatizing to
[582.46 --> 587.98]  watch like linus keep getting these updates and and then you eventually left yeah i weren't on the
[587.98 --> 596.50]  show so we decided to go just because um it's uh like sort of our son's cat and we basically decided
[596.50 --> 602.16]  that whether he lived or died at this point so he was like cat yeah whether the cat lived or died he
[602.16 --> 608.56]  was like in an oxygen chamber his breathing was elevated his kidneys and liver were both
[608.56 --> 614.08]  damaged according to the blood work that they did brain swelling as well yeah we needed to be
[614.08 --> 621.86]  there to let our son know because he was like his cat um he sleeps in his bed every night and like
[621.86 --> 628.64]  he's the first thing so we were at disneyland a little while ago and the first thing that my son said
[628.64 --> 634.94]  when we were on our way back from the airport was i want to see shadow and i was like you know great
[634.94 --> 640.70]  i mean at that time that was that was possible um so anyway that that's what i was dealing with
[640.70 --> 645.54]  last friday so that's why i wasn't on when show uh we actually got the call when we were driving home
[645.54 --> 651.38]  and we managed to we were only a few minutes after my son arrived home so he didn't have time to kind
[651.38 --> 656.04]  of ask too many questions and we just kind of took them all upstairs and explained what happened and
[656.04 --> 660.88]  sorry you got the call that the cat had passed yeah okay so by the time you had to explain to your kids
[660.88 --> 666.64]  it's not like you told one thing in that no i was driving up 184 and uh the vet actually texted
[666.64 --> 670.44]  yvonne so she was checking her texts in the passenger seat and said hey it looks like his
[670.44 --> 675.26]  breathing is normalizing a little bit we've got him in the oxygen chamber oh boy and then she called
[675.26 --> 684.70]  15 seconds after she texted oh he's gone oh boy yeah so she said it seemed to happen really suddenly he
[684.70 --> 690.50]  was hopped up on all kinds of meds she figures he probably didn't feel a thing but um i mean he suffered
[690.50 --> 698.48]  enough definitely had suffered enough by that point in time so um yeah anyway yeah we promised
[698.48 --> 703.08]  the whole show is not gonna be that yeah yeah i'm really sorry i mean i i will say that it has
[703.08 --> 709.48]  i i don't know i've just had a lot of perspective changing experiences lately um so the the perspective
[709.48 --> 716.56]  change that i had here was like you know what accidents can happen to anyone but um you know i know
[716.56 --> 721.34]  i know myself well enough for a fact to know that if i was there taking care of my kids
[721.34 --> 729.76]  um you know my my furry kids would be fine too so uh yvonne and i have both actually resolved to
[729.76 --> 736.14]  at least unless we find a unicorn caretaker for the kids someone amazing we're both cutting back to
[736.14 --> 742.00]  80 days here in the office and we're going to be uh doing one day a week each with the kids and
[742.00 --> 746.12]  getting more family help so our kids are just going to be raised by family moving forward if
[746.12 --> 750.82]  we're if we're able to anyway one of the other things that i haven't addressed on when show because
[750.82 --> 756.82]  i wasn't here last week is a lot of people have asked hey are you guys open um so what is linus
[756.82 --> 762.04]  media group doing in order to keep its staff safe because obviously that's a top priority for us not
[762.04 --> 768.32]  only just for ourselves quite frankly linus media group is a super young company i don't think we have
[768.32 --> 774.86]  anyone here over 40 actually uh our accountant one account might be 43 but we don't have anyone
[774.86 --> 780.58]  really with um any significant risk factors but just because you don't personally have any risk
[780.58 --> 785.02]  factors doesn't mean that this isn't a big deal because you could easily transmit to someone who does
[785.02 --> 793.10]  and it hasn't been demonstrated that being young is a huge risk factor but being very young is obviously
[793.10 --> 797.50]  a big risk factor we've got a couple people here on staff that do have very young kids now
[797.50 --> 801.66]  i don't know if they've talked about it publicly so i'm not gonna i have a baby she's like nine
[801.66 --> 806.54]  months okay there you go there's one there's one um so i don't know how private people are about
[806.54 --> 811.88]  these things so i try not to be the one to kind of break that sort of news but um so what are we
[811.88 --> 817.50]  doing um obviously mandatory hand sanitization hand washing after any time you're basically
[817.50 --> 822.78]  interacting with anything else that someone else is interacting with and when you first get to the
[822.78 --> 826.32]  building we're trying to be really militant about people heading straight to the sink
[826.32 --> 830.08]  like let's say you're walking in carrying your lunch you don't put your lunch in the fridge and
[830.08 --> 835.28]  then go wash your hands no drop your lunch don't touch that fridge handle i've been on people on
[835.28 --> 840.54]  people yep um so we're doing that um anyone who can work from home we've had them working from home
[840.54 --> 845.84]  we've had probably about half of our staff in here which is kind of nice to be honest because it makes
[845.84 --> 852.18]  the whole social distancing thing a lot easier um anyone with symptoms they are being immediately sent home
[852.18 --> 858.34]  any kinds of symptoms so we're not just limiting it to covid things like fever um like my understanding
[858.34 --> 865.02]  is that um someone who works here is it sneezing or oh i thought you were gonna say what's his name
[865.02 --> 869.52]  no no there's just there's some respiratory illness symptoms that are not necessarily covid related but
[869.52 --> 873.34]  just anything that looks like respiratory illness we're having people get out of here and go into
[873.34 --> 881.06]  quarantine immediately typically um i've been of the position that uh the salaries that we pay are good
[881.06 --> 885.62]  enough that if people need to take the occasional sick day they can just take a sick day and they'll
[885.62 --> 892.70]  they'll eat that but what we've done as an exception during this exceptional time is we've implemented a
[892.70 --> 900.54]  sick um i guess sick pay policy so people we basically put aside kind of a fund that if it runs out we
[900.54 --> 906.42]  will reevaluate but for now we've put a bucket of money and basically told people like look don't abuse
[906.42 --> 911.14]  this this is for people to make sure that if they're exposed to something or they think they're
[911.14 --> 914.92]  exposed to something or they have any symptoms whatsoever that they're able to self-quarantine
[914.92 --> 920.24]  um for two weeks so we're making sure that people are not going to be falling behind on their rent or
[920.24 --> 926.44]  anything i was reading a really horrible article um earlier this week about someone who basically got
[926.44 --> 932.12]  laid off because their restaurant shut down and they told their landlord and their landlord was like
[932.12 --> 939.62]  well then you better get another job like what job the economy is shutting down so
[939.62 --> 947.98]  for us the main thing our our mandate internally is we're going to be following all of the guidance
[947.98 --> 953.06]  that comes from the bc provincial government um so right now we are in compliance with everything
[953.06 --> 958.78]  that they're rolling out and if they roll out a lockdown uh or they say non-essential businesses
[958.78 --> 964.20]  need to close then we will cross that bridge when we get to it it might end up being you know riley
[964.20 --> 971.16]  wipes down a camera uh takes it home and writes and shoots tech linked at home and maybe sends the
[971.16 --> 975.82]  files to one of our editors then they edit it at home we're gonna make videos i don't think it'll be at
[975.82 --> 982.40]  the volume that we're doing now because like the cold hard truth for me is that this is a huge deal
[982.40 --> 990.74]  but also life needs to go on and like come on we're a tech company there's no excuse for us to not be
[990.74 --> 996.18]  able to use technology to do our jobs like there's certain professions there's certain industries that
[996.18 --> 1001.88]  are not going to be able to work around this but we should have that power so we're going to do our
[1001.88 --> 1006.66]  best to make sure that everyone is staying at work you actually really did surprise me on monday
[1006.66 --> 1010.18]  every monday we have a monday morning meeting that's an all-hands meeting everyone in the company is in
[1010.18 --> 1016.78]  one big room and even though only half the amount of people were here on monday uh we had everyone
[1016.78 --> 1021.76]  who's in the building had the meeting virtually everyone was at their own desk yeah like teamsing
[1021.76 --> 1027.82]  in to this big video chat i kind of thought i was like is it really that big of a deal but uh it's true
[1027.82 --> 1032.30]  if we were all in that room we would have to be at least within three feet of each other and that was
[1032.30 --> 1037.16]  just a little thing that was cumbersome but it reduced our risk factors yeah and we do have a couple
[1037.16 --> 1041.76]  people who think that they might have been exposed at some point so those people are currently taking
[1041.76 --> 1047.48]  advantage of no not taking advantage of they're currently utilizing the sick pay policy that we've
[1047.48 --> 1052.34]  put in place to to deal with this problem i just i wanted to make sure that people don't have
[1052.34 --> 1058.96]  any incentive to be here if they shouldn't be here that's that's the thing with it's not like
[1058.96 --> 1063.76]  in normal circumstances if you had a bit of a sore throat or a little annoying or a little tummy ache or
[1063.76 --> 1070.14]  something you probably just come in but in this case we don't want that yeah you shouldn't yeah
[1070.14 --> 1076.26]  you know what i reason to you know what i really hope i hope that the one good thing that comes out
[1076.26 --> 1083.72]  of all of this is that we all take a moment did you see those pictures from venice italy of the water
[1083.72 --> 1087.78]  running clear yeah and apparently there's like dolphins getting closer and stuff like that yeah
[1087.78 --> 1093.44]  yeah i thought that was absolutely incredible i there's there's few things that bother me more
[1093.44 --> 1099.54]  than an in-person briefing uh or an in-person presentation for some new product or something
[1099.54 --> 1104.58]  when it could have just as easily been done as a webex presentation it's really will be interesting
[1104.58 --> 1108.88]  to see how many companies realize wow actually working from home made us more productive and it's
[1108.88 --> 1113.16]  just cheaper for us and half our companies should be doing this at all times and i haven't i haven't
[1113.16 --> 1118.18]  shaken hands with anyone at a public event except like when i have like a very dirt moment because
[1118.18 --> 1124.48]  i'm exhausted or whatever in years strongly recommend it i haven't gotten sick in years i hope
[1124.48 --> 1130.26]  handshaking goes i wonder to what to what extent this will change our culture permanently from here on
[1130.26 --> 1133.92]  out that's what i was just i was just thinking about that the other day like all the teleconferencing
[1133.92 --> 1139.50]  that people are doing the way that all these companies are switching to just uh doing their product
[1139.50 --> 1145.50]  announcements online like the problem that i see like the the thing that i see that could ruin it
[1145.50 --> 1151.34]  is that if they do all this stuff online and they all have a terrible year because it's going to be
[1151.34 --> 1155.66]  a terrible year they won't be able to parse those apart the people who are going to be hurt the most
[1155.66 --> 1162.80]  are the people that are in your your blue collar labor jobs or service industry jobs where nobody's
[1162.80 --> 1168.62]  going out right you can't bring people together to manufacture something you can't have people sitting
[1168.62 --> 1173.40]  together enjoying meals together so how are those people going to have jobs those guys are going to
[1173.40 --> 1178.18]  be hurt really really badly and they're not going to be able to buy stuff so what i worry is that
[1178.18 --> 1183.70]  companies are going to see oh our sales sucked when we did all these product launches online and
[1183.70 --> 1189.94]  correlate something that may not be correlated maybe when the economy recovers next year or the year
[1189.94 --> 1194.74]  after who knows how long we're going to be in this for um you know maybe if they stayed the course
[1194.74 --> 1200.24]  with this we could actually just reduce our dependence on air travel that'd be pretty cool
[1200.24 --> 1203.26]  yeah well environmentally that's a huge huge suck
[1203.26 --> 1209.12]  it's going to be rough for anyone who's uh hoping to buy american airlines in the dip but uh yeah we'll
[1209.12 --> 1216.52]  see how that goes for you uh maybe we should get on to uh tech topics yeah sorry i guess i feel like i
[1216.52 --> 1221.00]  got a little bit off topic but people don't seem to uh people don't seem to mind for the most part
[1221.00 --> 1227.74]  uh mario madness yeah i used to get sick at ces every year i stopped shaking hands that was it
[1227.74 --> 1232.12]  and i would carry around hand sanitizer and anytime i like derped and i was like oh shoot i forgot i
[1232.12 --> 1239.24]  don't shake hands anymore hand sanitized stop getting sick period also not not touching my face
[1239.24 --> 1241.78]  so are we all going to grow our hair out for the summer or what
[1241.78 --> 1247.82]  uh i'm gonna get my wife to cut it we won't be willing to notice the difference probably i was just
[1247.82 --> 1248.12]  thinking
[1248.12 --> 1256.64]  funny funnier than you yeah all right i was i was just thinking about that the other day how do i go
[1256.64 --> 1262.34]  get a haircut while maintaining my social distancing bubble i've got a huge unibrow now surprise guys
[1262.34 --> 1268.84]  i get my eyebrows did it's not gonna be possible uh how are you sorry yeah sure you might really want
[1268.84 --> 1275.66]  to get into tech but we will talk about the xbox how are you staying fit um beat saber okay so um i
[1275.66 --> 1279.80]  so i wasn't able to play badminton on monday i had actually already skipped last week for some reason
[1279.80 --> 1285.16]  or another um so i i haven't been playing badminton which is my primary form of exercise do you plan to
[1285.16 --> 1289.98]  continue even though you're social distancing badminton yes well badminton's pretty social
[1289.98 --> 1296.74]  distancy i had planned to continue to play but just maintain a big bubble sanitize my hands in between
[1296.74 --> 1301.90]  matches because you do touch the shuttle and everyone touches the shuttle and then um no high
[1301.90 --> 1306.34]  fives at the end of the game so that was kind of my plan uh maybe switch to playing singles instead
[1306.34 --> 1313.64]  of playing doubles so i don't have to be close to anyone yeah um but the place that i play at um that
[1313.64 --> 1318.46]  my friend runs they shut down for two weeks at least so i don't really even have anywhere to play
[1318.46 --> 1326.66]  backyard uh backyard badminton what do i look like a white person to you excuse me backyard badminton
[1326.66 --> 1334.64]  it's not even the same game yeah anyway um so so i got two plans one is i'm gonna be playing beat
[1334.64 --> 1340.20]  saber every other day for at least half an hour it is have you played i'm sure it's a cardio workout it
[1340.20 --> 1347.58]  is phenomenal i play ddr like fast okay it's it's cardio yeah it's phenomenal workout and then what
[1347.58 --> 1352.72]  i'm gonna do is i'm going to put some badminton lines in my garage just with tape like on the
[1352.72 --> 1358.06]  concrete uh slab there and then there's footwork drills that you can do that are really brutal have
[1358.06 --> 1361.76]  you seen the size of a badminton court right yeah so there's a really great drill where you just take
[1361.76 --> 1367.04]  a couple shuttles and you put them in one of the very far corners and then what you do is as fast as
[1367.04 --> 1372.18]  you can you lunge around the court picking them up all the way off the ground and then back to center
[1372.18 --> 1378.66]  and then pick a corner and then you go and put it down in that corner like put it down gently because
[1378.66 --> 1385.38]  what it really trains you to do is do controlled lunges and then push off strong back off it and so you
[1385.38 --> 1393.24]  do what is effectively uh 12 sets so you grab one and take it grab the other take it grab that put it
[1393.24 --> 1396.26]  somewhere else grab that put it somewhere else and then you go back to start
[1396.26 --> 1401.28]  do you typically do drills like that um when you're training yes do you though but when i'm just
[1401.28 --> 1406.48]  playing no no i don't really maybe you'll come back a better player like lance armstrong after cancer
[1406.48 --> 1411.64]  and drugs i would love to i would love to it should be it should be doable because that is one of my
[1411.64 --> 1417.96]  biggest issues is that i don't work out i just play really hard um and i don't play enough for that
[1417.96 --> 1423.90]  to really maintain me yeah i mean i'm doing all right but i'm screwed all my all my things are high
[1423.90 --> 1429.52]  contact oh yeah jujitsu is like i i went a couple weeks ago yeah it's like someone's face on your
[1429.52 --> 1434.54]  face right i went kind of when this was popping off and people were starting to wonder what they
[1434.54 --> 1439.62]  should cut out of their lives and i go there and like within the first few minutes i got someone spit
[1439.62 --> 1445.14]  on me like the guy's kind of lispy and like some spit like landed here i was like this is done this is
[1445.14 --> 1450.48]  over then if you lift weights that's that's over yoga group class that's over like i can't do
[1450.48 --> 1456.34]  anything i might go for a jog and i hate jogging i hate jogging so much i'll go for sprints sprinting's
[1456.34 --> 1461.74]  fun i have bad knees so jogging is like the worst basically the worst thing you can do to your knees
[1461.74 --> 1467.34]  is jog around in the city like on the pavement yeah yeah i would do pavement yeah so actually
[1467.34 --> 1471.04]  okay here's another personal update i swear to you we'll talk tech at some point
[1471.04 --> 1476.00]  um so i i don't know if i told you but i did end up going and seeing the orthopedic surgeon
[1476.00 --> 1483.38]  about my knee yeah yeah yeah and um it turns out that i have a um a meniscus tear and it looks like
[1483.38 --> 1488.88]  it is probably not going to heal so there's like the the red tissue and then the white tissue that
[1488.88 --> 1495.34]  doesn't have as much blood flow and if the tear goes into the the white tissue then is the red tissue
[1495.34 --> 1499.98]  also meniscus or only white it is meniscus but it's like more likely to heal it's at the outside
[1499.98 --> 1505.56]  yeah because there's blood flow there and uh basically what he thinks uh the mri was not
[1505.56 --> 1510.98]  conclusive but what he thinks is that there's a tear there that might be kind of like a hangnail
[1510.98 --> 1515.94]  and so if he just went in and like kind of clipped it off it would stop kind of moving around and
[1515.94 --> 1520.12]  bothering me and then maybe he can put back together the part that's torn and that would
[1520.12 --> 1524.96]  that would totally fix it with just two little holes and i'd be off my feet i'd be on crutches for
[1524.96 --> 1530.76]  six weeks but that's a long time that's a long time to be on crutches especially my job like i
[1530.76 --> 1538.58]  move i actually move around a lot at work upstairs and downstairs a lot products around like i i i some
[1538.58 --> 1544.26]  people sort of talk about like oh how does how's linus look so fit i only i play badminton once a
[1544.26 --> 1550.08]  week for two hours and i move around a lot at work this is like a 10 000 square foot warehouse
[1550.08 --> 1556.60]  and more than probably anyone else i am upstairs grabbing something downstairs checking in with
[1556.60 --> 1560.40]  someone uh grabbing a bunch of products from the warehouse over there taking that back up to my
[1560.40 --> 1564.98]  office opening them all up putting them down picking them up like and you're the type of person who
[1564.98 --> 1569.64]  often chooses to run up the stairs oh yeah i do things fast i always do things fast i always walk
[1569.64 --> 1573.98]  fast take two stairs at a time all that kind of little stuff it makes such a difference i remember
[1573.98 --> 1578.20]  one of the most life-changing moments for me was in my sports psychology class
[1578.20 --> 1585.48]  like sports psychology 100 in university and um the the professor basically said you know how to
[1585.48 --> 1592.56]  have a six-pack just flex your stomach all the time just when you're walking around just
[1592.56 --> 1601.92]  just flex your stomach all the time i haven't done a sit-up in three years at least but it's just like
[1601.92 --> 1607.92]  that's what you do just everything you do do it hard and i was like oh and i'm not in great shape
[1607.92 --> 1612.44]  i could have better cardio and particularly my legs like i think my if i do those footwork drills i
[1612.44 --> 1618.28]  will come back like way better but just little things make such a big difference it's tiny say
[1618.28 --> 1624.42]  that okinawans in japan live the longest uh one of their contributing factors is that they don't
[1624.42 --> 1629.02]  uh sit at tables and chairs like this to eat they dine on the ground they sit on the floor right and
[1629.02 --> 1634.08]  when you're just standing going from imagine my grandma in the west so many of our elderly people
[1634.08 --> 1638.44]  are overweight like getting cross-legged and then standing up would be like a trial probably have
[1638.44 --> 1642.54]  to lean out and grab something if you did that a hundred times in a day oh your longevity is
[1642.54 --> 1650.56]  yeah that's a good point okay okay we will talk tech i swear wait wait i'm just joking
[1650.56 --> 1659.92]  just joking uh stephen dubois weird flex but okay i was actually impressed by that
[1659.92 --> 1665.88]  that's that's what i look like i'm not like i don't have a lot of punch because you do a lot of cardio
[1665.88 --> 1673.66]  and just you hold yourself do you think do you do you eat well no because you go to like a and w
[1673.66 --> 1679.42]  how many times a week you go to a and w or fast food like that okay guys to be clear canadian a and
[1679.42 --> 1685.20]  w is not the same as american a and w i would not eat that garbage but canadian a and w is actually a
[1685.20 --> 1690.02]  lot better it's still fast food to be very clear it's burgers and fries it's burgers and fries though
[1690.02 --> 1695.90]  uh or onion rings there's some veggies in there oh yeah i got the onion rings so my biggest thing over
[1695.90 --> 1702.82]  the last year is i've cut out uh sugary drinks including fruit juice um i basically don't touch it
[1702.82 --> 1709.60]  anymore and that is such a huge thing and i feel like that's easy it is not that i think it's
[1709.60 --> 1714.04]  easier than like for me if i have to choose i'm like do i want to eat like do i want to eat a whole
[1714.04 --> 1719.06]  bag of chips and slam an ice cream or have pop i'm gonna cut out pop that's gonna be way easier for
[1719.06 --> 1724.92]  me i love orange juice really i love tropicana lots of pulp orange juice oh man it's good but
[1724.92 --> 1729.06]  like i love it so much once you cut something like that you find that you look at it and you're
[1729.06 --> 1732.52]  like that's disgusting i don't need that anymore no i still love orange juice you still see it
[1732.52 --> 1739.02]  i love that i love that nest tea man oh your childhood i can put back like you probably had
[1739.02 --> 1745.10]  so much i can put back a two liter of nest tea in like a single meal like i'll make bathroom trips
[1745.10 --> 1751.80]  but like oh i love that stuff so much sugar ice cold man ice cold love it um so so no i wouldn't
[1751.80 --> 1757.86]  say that i eat particularly well but i also try i try not to just like go out of my way to eat garbage
[1757.86 --> 1763.86]  so i mostly don't eat like cookies and ice cream and like some of my some of my favorite things um
[1763.86 --> 1767.42]  like i like i used to but the big one is probably just cutting out sugary drinks
[1767.42 --> 1774.14]  don't read any chats that's why we keep not talking about tech yeah no no no i swear i swear to you
[1774.14 --> 1780.50]  guys i'm gonna do this okay here we go here we go xbox series expects announced this was posted by
[1780.50 --> 1788.00]  vegetable stew on the forum so the cpu is going to be eight zen 2 cores at 3.8 gigahertz or 3.6 with
[1788.00 --> 1793.30]  smt apparently so smt formerly known as intel hyper threading but now that amd has it we're going
[1793.30 --> 1799.36]  back to the the generic non-cleenex name we're going with the tissue paper you know name like the
[1799.36 --> 1804.94]  variable refresh rate compared to g-sync that's right so it means two threads or actually more is it ibm
[1804.94 --> 1810.16]  that does four threads per core on some of their cpus i think so um but it means multiple threads
[1810.16 --> 1815.82]  per core so that the pipeline never gets empty and there is a power toll there so that would explain
[1815.82 --> 1820.02]  why they might need to drop the frequency down a little bit depending on what the console is doing
[1820.02 --> 1828.20]  yeah that's right seven nanometer so basically this is like a like a ryzen ryzen 9 whatever the
[1828.20 --> 1833.82]  ryzen 7 something or other i can't remember which one the eight core like three high gigahertz one is
[1833.82 --> 1842.04]  uh the gpu is going to be a 12 teraflop 52 compute unit 1.825 gigahertz custom rdna2 graphics card
[1842.04 --> 1847.96]  uh it's going to have 16 gigs of gdr6 memory so it looks like we're seeing a return of shared memory
[1847.96 --> 1854.06]  between the gpu and the rest of the system and by the way that uh memory spec is the same as the ps5
[1854.06 --> 1859.60]  but those previous specs cpu and gpu are actually a little lower than the ps5 the ps5 is clocked lower
[1859.60 --> 1866.44]  than that and it has um two fewer teraflops than that on the gpu side oh interesting get a suck
[1866.44 --> 1872.26]  interesting storage is going to be one terabyte of custom nvme ssd why are they doing a custom ssd
[1872.26 --> 1881.04]  like just just use just use m.2 why yeah especially considering like my first thought was maybe it's
[1881.04 --> 1886.52]  just the the design of of the thing so that it fits in this really tight chassis that they're
[1886.52 --> 1893.12]  making but m.2 is tiny it's tiny there's no way you're already just a computer okay other than the
[1893.12 --> 1901.60]  shared graphics memory uh for the cpu so we get a 4k uhd blu-ray drive 120 fps support i'm interested in
[1901.60 --> 1909.34]  the 4k uh uh uh the 4k blu-ray drive why because i want now that i have plex get good i don't have
[1909.34 --> 1914.76]  gigabit get good get you don't have gigabit like you don't have gigabit networking in your house oh
[1914.76 --> 1920.66]  no building just got fiber so i have i think 150 up and down oh okay no no no no so you can run your
[1920.66 --> 1925.48]  plex thing in a closet though no but i don't have a plex server i have an account my friend has one and
[1925.48 --> 1933.04]  i like i'm on there okay well okay so wait hold on be careful what you say here because you're about
[1933.04 --> 1942.06]  this close to james getting upgraded for a video okay so my point is that the better way if you're
[1942.06 --> 1948.36]  going to like watch a blue because it really is the best way to watch a movie especially if you have
[1948.36 --> 1953.14]  a nice tv which i believe you upgraded your tv i have an oled yeah you have a nice tv and by the way i bought
[1953.14 --> 1958.56]  my oled from a uh a liquidation auction sale from like something gets returned to best buy i remember
[1958.56 --> 1964.00]  that yeah i remember it had a little scratch about this big tiny on the front yeah and i remember uh i
[1964.00 --> 1968.52]  looked at the photos before i bought on the auction i was like oh that scratch it was kind of an extreme
[1968.52 --> 1973.16]  close-up photo so i had no scale for the scratch scratch you know if it was this long or this long i
[1973.16 --> 1976.94]  didn't know where if it was in the top corner in the middle i didn't know at all i show up there
[1976.94 --> 1983.70]  yeah and it's like right there in the middle like on this screen it would be like here and it's like
[1983.70 --> 1989.64]  about a centimeter long and i was like uh and then they gave me the option really you don't have to
[1989.64 --> 1994.82]  take it you want to you can leave it take it or leave it and i took it and then like when i got home
[1994.82 --> 2000.36]  i was like why did i take this and you'll remember i came into your office because i was doing a bunch of
[2000.36 --> 2004.28]  research on how to fill in scratches like that oh yeah there's a bunch of techniques on the internet
[2004.28 --> 2009.26]  yeah you wanted to make a video out of it but then i think you wanted me to sacrifice a different tv
[2009.26 --> 2013.82]  so that we could find out the right method so that you could do it on no no no i want no no no no you
[2013.82 --> 2019.20]  wanted you said uh we'll do it on your tv uh but if it breaks you're just screwed and i said yeah i
[2019.20 --> 2024.32]  think i did say that no we'll do it on my tv and if it breaks then like you have to pay for it or
[2024.32 --> 2029.06]  replace it or something i was like i get nothing out of this you get a video and i get nothing you would
[2029.06 --> 2034.14]  have gotten free scratch removal kit or whatever i look at it it would have been the video that i write
[2034.14 --> 2038.70]  i would have to be done on the research well you i would have paid you to write it anyway
[2038.70 --> 2044.66]  it's a non-issue i don't even remember that the scratch exists most of the time unless i'm watching
[2044.66 --> 2049.40]  on a sunny day because the light has to hit it right so so the blu-ray really is the best way to
[2049.40 --> 2057.16]  watch a movie but and a 4k blu-ray player is about 120 150 bucks which is a great value except that you can
[2057.16 --> 2065.78]  just okay so i will confess to you i don't bother ripping blu-rays anymore but much of my plex library
[2065.78 --> 2071.52]  not all of it some not all of it's possible not all of it's released yet some things i admit i've
[2071.52 --> 2076.80]  been lazy about and i'm a little bit behind but much of my plex library is physical media backed but i
[2076.80 --> 2083.64]  don't bother ripping them anymore but the ultimate is ripping real blu-rays to a plex server and then just
[2083.64 --> 2087.72]  using that to stream the media around your house or out of your house so i have a good enough
[2087.72 --> 2093.08]  connection that from anywhere i can just watch a full quality blu-ray copy what bit rate is that
[2093.08 --> 2099.38]  so it goes like 70 it goes up to as high as like 80 plus depending on the movie yeah so that's it's
[2099.38 --> 2104.72]  pretty heavy but as long as your server is okay and as long as your connection is good enough which
[2104.72 --> 2109.52]  yours is as long as you've got like a symmetric fiber connection if i was invited to yours and i streamed
[2109.52 --> 2116.20]  that could i ever get that bit rate considering my fiber connection of 150 up and down yeah yeah i i
[2116.20 --> 2122.74]  my in-laws are on it so you're saying i need to get on that uh no i'm not i'm not saying that i am
[2122.74 --> 2127.70]  comfortable i'm comfortable sharing it with people that i could just as easily share a physical copy
[2127.70 --> 2132.40]  with i wouldn't you wouldn't lend me a you wouldn't i lent you a book and you've had it for like nine
[2132.40 --> 2138.18]  months okay so here's that's true i haven't finished yet so that so here's the here's the thing though
[2138.18 --> 2145.38]  that's where i think you end up in this really really slippery slope and i know that slippery
[2145.38 --> 2152.04]  slope arguments are inherently flawed but for me the line is as long as i have in good faith made
[2152.04 --> 2159.32]  every effort to have a physical backed up copy uh i don't feel bad about what is effectively not
[2159.32 --> 2166.18]  permitted copying this media and uh hosting it on my own server for my own consumption now you're
[2166.18 --> 2169.94]  considering the distribution that you're doing to be within the confidence of what you would do with
[2169.94 --> 2176.04]  physical media yes and so it's easy enough to say okay well hey we all work here together every day
[2176.04 --> 2184.16]  why don't we all just buy 1 30th of every movie that comes out because we could just share them with
[2184.16 --> 2190.18]  each other create a work repository of blu-rays a bunch of board games over there that's our physically
[2190.18 --> 2196.14]  we do and people can borrow them so our physically backed up you know digital library that we all
[2196.14 --> 2203.42]  share and it's like okay now we're getting pretty close to a torrent site which is effectively what
[2203.42 --> 2208.34]  that is now not always and actually yeah in basically every case any good quality torrent
[2208.34 --> 2215.00]  would be from someone who paid for the content yeah a good quality one yeah yeah i guess no even a bad
[2215.00 --> 2221.52]  one even a cam you still paid to be in the theater technically yeah so so that's well unless you work
[2221.52 --> 2230.04]  there so so i don't know so that's the that's a slippery slope so my line right now is family i'm not
[2230.04 --> 2233.70]  offended you have many employees family that's another slippery slope someone else might be like
[2233.70 --> 2238.98]  oh i want to be on it luke's on it too so family and luke luke's my accept he's he's on my he's on my
[2238.98 --> 2244.10]  google play music account too i put him on like literally years ago i know it was on wanshow recently
[2244.10 --> 2250.68]  freaking guy you can you can watch that on the lmg clips um oh yeah we're actually talking about
[2250.68 --> 2256.70]  the specs of this okay right so it has a blu-ray player that's 4k which i agree is a big deal if
[2256.70 --> 2262.98]  you like are living the stone age and you like rent blu-rays at the store or whatever you know what
[2262.98 --> 2267.94]  though there's a blu-ray there's a video store by my place that i would love to support but they don't
[2267.94 --> 2273.00]  have 4k blu-rays and they probably don't have them because no one has a 4k blu-ray player because
[2273.00 --> 2278.32]  they cost more and i'm wondering if when this is really saturated and everyone has a ps5 or xbox
[2278.32 --> 2282.04]  series x and they all have these players maybe that store will start stocking more yeah because
[2282.04 --> 2288.28]  the 1s has it but the 1s as i would be interested to see the true numbers but i suspect the 1s
[2288.28 --> 2295.16]  is a relative like the newer versions of the xbox like the 1x s and x s and x i believe also has it
[2295.16 --> 2300.04]  no x is the better one so it would i came out after the s it was more to do with when they were
[2300.04 --> 2304.30]  released because the original xbox is actually better than the s if i recall correctly is it or
[2304.30 --> 2309.80]  are they the same performance i can't remember is the s just a smaller one uh no no no no no no no
[2309.80 --> 2315.16]  the s has i think a greater a better hard drive and then the x major was a stronger so you can play 4k
[2315.16 --> 2320.24]  yeah okay okay so anyway yeah so i would suspect that because those didn't come until later in the
[2320.24 --> 2328.20]  life cycle a lot of the xboxes out there do not have these 4k uhd blu-ray players um so once we
[2328.20 --> 2333.54]  have a new console that gets you know a year or two into its life cycle yeah i think we could expect
[2333.54 --> 2340.28]  your local movie rental store if it still exists yeah to have uh to make it through this uh slump
[2340.28 --> 2344.58]  right that's the type of business that might not make it through it oh yeah for sure like streaming
[2344.58 --> 2350.80]  like if i'm netflix right now i'm laughing if i'm disney i'm laughing a lot less because disney plus
[2350.80 --> 2356.78]  i'm laughing but my theme parks i am oh boy i'm not laughing they did you see that man we are never
[2356.78 --> 2359.64]  going to get through these specs did you see they were talking about reopening disney world
[2359.64 --> 2364.52]  why with like reimagined visitor experiences
[2364.52 --> 2370.14]  something or something like that like they were working on it basically i was like how are you
[2370.14 --> 2375.78]  going to do that that doesn't make any sense and i don't know who would go how did this hit the media
[2375.78 --> 2380.08]  like that seems like something someone's thinking about long term but they would never have announced
[2380.08 --> 2384.38]  yet yeah maybe i'm not sure okay let's let's just ignore that let's pretend that never happened
[2384.38 --> 2389.74]  uh so potential for 8k resolution although i would not expect to be gaming at 8k unless we're
[2389.74 --> 2397.90]  talking like you know back catalog like xbox 360 games or something like that uh ray tracing technology
[2397.90 --> 2402.40]  although we don't know exactly you know what form that's going to take it certainly won't be using
[2402.40 --> 2410.78]  any of nvidia's proprietary nonsense and compatibility with xbox one accessories that to me is like the
[2410.78 --> 2415.24]  coolest thing out of all of that because everything else was basically expected
[2415.24 --> 2418.18]  what other cpu were they going to use
[2418.18 --> 2427.36]  arm yeah exactly exactly we're going back to this we're gonna we bought sony's cell processor unit and
[2427.36 --> 2433.62]  we made a new cell processor get real you know remember the kill zone shoe trailer yeah 120 fps wow
[2433.62 --> 2442.22]  what a big surprise that an hdmi 2.1 connection can run 120 fps saying 8k or 120 fps doesn't mean
[2442.22 --> 2448.54]  anything because we don't know what actual details the game is running at you could go get an you could
[2448.54 --> 2457.74]  go get an xbox 360 and if you had an hdmi 2.1 output you could run a game at 8k 120 fps it might be pong
[2457.74 --> 2464.78]  but those are just the smoothest moving balls right the highest the highest resolution pong of all
[2464.78 --> 2470.94]  time that ball so round it's like that ball so right at my face yeah um but that doesn't mean
[2470.94 --> 2478.26]  anything to me the fact that they are finally stopping this practice where we just get milked
[2478.26 --> 2484.48]  on rebuying the same plastic controller when it's the same control especially when it's basically the
[2484.48 --> 2489.28]  they perfected that controller i have four of them i don't want to buy four more exactly they're
[2489.28 --> 2495.68]  expensive exactly so whether whether whether they did it through an adapter or whether they just made
[2495.68 --> 2499.76]  it natively compatible doesn't matter to me as long as there's some way to keep using them because
[2499.76 --> 2504.34]  that's one of the coolest things about the pc is that i can still use my logitech dual action that i
[2504.34 --> 2511.60]  bought in high school because why not it's just a usb connection everyone's just using usb and so if
[2511.60 --> 2520.72]  you're gonna just use industry standards then just just use them it's just a driver it's just that's
[2520.72 --> 2527.28]  all it is just just load it on there so they're finally doing it kudos to microsoft love it
[2528.64 --> 2532.40]  is that the last thing that i'm looking at your screen even though i have this i'm calm i'm
[2532.40 --> 2537.68]  was that the last i'm completely calm well i have to talk through the sponsors um do you want to do the
[2537.68 --> 2541.68]  se demo with me or should i let nick go first nick i'm here nick nick what can i do for you we have
[2541.68 --> 2547.20]  a store oh that's right ltt even in these trying times what store is that yeah we actually have a
[2547.20 --> 2552.88]  couple things in stock even we've got the water bottles back in stock which is pretty sick uh we've
[2552.88 --> 2558.32]  got this one they're back black on black uh black and orange do we have black and orange uh black and

[2568.48 --> 2573.20]  black and white uh we're still giving away stickers with every order right yep this is the most creative
[2573.20 --> 2579.04]  way to arrange your stickers and have we loaded up some of those just like old items not or not yet
[2579.04 --> 2582.00]  we said we were going to talk about that next week oh okay apparently we're going to talk about
[2582.00 --> 2587.36]  that next week very limited quantities of the swagget available again yep so guys we did not do another
[2587.36 --> 2591.44]  run of it and we are not planning to do another i mean should we do another run of it probably not
[2591.44 --> 2594.80]  are we still engaged with that factory or did we find that they weren't very good well no
[2595.68 --> 2599.20]  it's it's all good okay no we're not doing it but we're not doing another okay we're not doing
[2599.20 --> 2603.92]  another run of the swagget you heard it from nick it's you know if you uh if you want to complain
[2603.92 --> 2610.80]  about it that's going to be an uh at uh at nick underscore lmg i think on twitter yeah just blow
[2610.80 --> 2616.88]  blow them up all right blow them up yeah no underscore yeah no underscore promote me right if you're
[2616.88 --> 2622.96]  going to promote me yeah uh underwear is still in stock right yeah yeah okay 3xl i think is out
[2622.96 --> 2628.80]  3xl's out all right sorry sorry big boys going commando we'll get you covered we'll get you covered
[2628.80 --> 2636.08]  again later and for all of those of you who were who were just really hoping for this the cable ties are
[2636.08 --> 2642.40]  in fact still available i know i know see you can see there's so much there's so much demand i can't
[2642.40 --> 2646.80]  even load this page quickly right now we haven't even talked about how this is the first time you're
[2646.80 --> 2651.92]  seeing the new store on wancho oh that's right did they not show it last week i think they did oh yeah
[2651.92 --> 2656.40]  yeah the the redesigned store well no i mean i had obviously seen it i actually haven't spent time
[2656.40 --> 2662.72]  on here so it has the like carousel style wait a second it's more than one page yeah yeah i know right
[2662.72 --> 2669.04]  so it has this uh rotating thing up here i like the uh the ltt logo and line work there that's cool
[2669.04 --> 2673.52]  yep so that's cool and then it's got like our favorites which is sort of like a combination of
[2673.52 --> 2680.56]  like top sellers or things that are limited time or you know whatever else or new um then there's
[2680.56 --> 2685.52]  clothing and gear and we're gonna hope to add a lot more stuff over the next little bit but as you guys
[2685.52 --> 2690.80]  know it's been an extremely challenging time i mean even just keeping something as basic as a black t-shirt
[2690.80 --> 2697.60]  in stock has not actually been that trivial so yeah especially last few months have been pretty brutal
[2697.60 --> 2701.36]  yeah we're trying to get a lot of restocks so massive massive shout out to the team they're
[2701.36 --> 2705.44]  they're working through it we've got all kinds of stuff going did i ever upload that story about the
[2705.44 --> 2710.24]  um the uh the little squishy thing don't you have it in your hand right now no no that's that's
[2710.24 --> 2714.72]  something this is just you probably shouldn't though because we're like oh man even starting
[2714.72 --> 2718.40]  early yeah i'm really excited about that one though all right all right anyway doesn't matter
[2718.40 --> 2722.88]  doesn't matter all right let's move on to our sponsors for the show today you were also on
[2722.88 --> 2726.80]  an episode of carpool critics we talked about contagion yes i you know what the shameless
[2726.80 --> 2732.72]  self-promotion if we're gonna do it let's do it boys so uh carpool critics is a sort of like what
[2732.72 --> 2738.72]  would we call that like an incubator project or like uh like a skunk works type of project i don't know
[2738.72 --> 2745.12]  how it exists in your mind this is news to me uh i don't know exactly basically riley james and david
[2745.12 --> 2753.52]  were really passionate and really excited to do just a movie podcast and um they were like do you
[2753.52 --> 2759.92]  consider this to be a conflicting media because in our employment contracts here we say look you can't
[2759.92 --> 2765.76]  utilize your linus media group fame and influence to just go and be your own tech youtuber on the side
[2765.76 --> 2772.16]  that's not really how this works so we work with people who want to create on their own like taryn for
[2772.16 --> 2777.20]  example where we say okay yeah it can't be conflicting or if you feel like it might be
[2777.20 --> 2782.80]  conflicting have a meeting with me about it like i try to be a refusal basically basically so they
[2782.80 --> 2787.92]  brought it to me write a first refusal and i think it was a big surprise i was like he's not gonna want
[2787.92 --> 2795.28]  it but all right we'll have the meeting i was like yeah because the the concept i thought was great i
[2795.28 --> 2800.88]  didn't like the original name or like some of like kind of the direction you guys sort of were pitching it
[2800.88 --> 2807.20]  at me from but what really excited me was i loved hearing these guys just talk about movies really
[2807.20 --> 2814.08]  loud when they should be working um out in the studio because we would get into these spirited
[2814.08 --> 2818.64]  discussions that sometimes would make their way over onto twitter they would overflow like what's
[2818.64 --> 2824.08]  a better movie hercules or mulan don't get david started on disney don't get david started especially
[2824.08 --> 2829.36]  on hercules he thinks that movie is so much better than it is he is right it is better than i thought it
[2829.36 --> 2834.32]  was i re-watched it as an adult it's actually not it's not that bad it's pretty good but it's not
[2834.32 --> 2838.48]  better than mulan and i i'm not going to be on that episode i don't want to i don't want to
[2839.44 --> 2844.16]  i don't think our relationship can take it but uh the origin story was that we carpooled together
[2844.16 --> 2849.20]  and then the carpool ended so we wanted to keep talking and making you pay for us to do that but
[2849.76 --> 2853.36]  that's why it's called carpool critics but one of the problems with that name is a lot of people are
[2853.36 --> 2858.16]  like why isn't this in a car yeah and i was like i was one of the reservations i had about naming
[2858.16 --> 2863.44]  at carpool critics but uh the spirit of the origin is in the name but we actually record it with good
[2863.44 --> 2867.92]  audio quality here in the studio yes and it will get better so when we finish the renos we're going
[2867.92 --> 2872.40]  to redo actually we're going to try to integrate the wan show into the new podcast set we're going to
[2872.40 --> 2876.08]  do carpool critics there we'll get like some displates or something so that we can kind of nick and
[2876.08 --> 2880.88]  i had a meme about this so we might not always be sitting beside each other in wan show in the future
[2881.52 --> 2887.12]  it might be just on you and then camera switches to someone else that kind of change i know it's gonna be
[2887.12 --> 2891.84]  your wrap i guess we gotta hold on here i gotta hold on the good they are you guys think about the
[2891.84 --> 2894.80]  background because we were talking about different options for having different backgrounds because
[2894.80 --> 2898.24]  let's say you have one room where you're going to use multiple different shows and they each should
[2898.24 --> 2903.68]  have their own brand identity yeah you want a quick way to turn a room around so that when you're
[2903.68 --> 2908.56]  looking at carpool critics you know you're looking at carpool critics um one option is mountable
[2908.56 --> 2914.56]  posters that you can turn over maybe tvs that have different browning displayed maybe a curtain tv's tough to
[2914.56 --> 2920.24]  make look not tacky i like curtains and they reflect the heart of shoot i also like rolling or sliding
[2920.24 --> 2926.00]  like solid backdrops um oh we had an idea today that was novel yeah a shelf that has memorabilia on
[2926.00 --> 2930.08]  it like a bunch of movie stuff on a shelf and that stuff is glued to the shelf and you just take the
[2930.08 --> 2934.56]  whole shelf off and you bring in the next shelf with like all the gaming stuff on it i actually kind
[2934.56 --> 2941.44]  of like that that's that's pretty that's a pretty clever idea i like it um laura that's gonna be sweet
[2941.44 --> 2946.16]  though because we'll have a proper room with proper audio stuff and it'll be a closed off room so that
[2946.16 --> 2949.60]  we don't need to interrupt filming anywhere else in the building because that's a big problem we have
[2949.60 --> 2954.72]  right now right now the podcast is just in a random office up there but it's right beside linus's office
[2954.72 --> 2958.80]  so if they're doing a vlog in linus's office yeah we can't do the podcast and then there's other sets
[2958.80 --> 2963.20]  down here where you just can't film in the kitchen while we're filming in the bedroom for example the
[2963.20 --> 2969.52]  the podcast gets very spirited sometimes so anyway we decided to do contagion which was a perfect fit
[2969.52 --> 2974.00]  because david wasn't able to make it because he's in self-isolation because he was advised that
[2974.00 --> 2980.80]  he may have come in contact with a um an airport worker i think uh so he came back from our trip to
[2980.80 --> 2988.64]  toronto um two days or three days after me like just a little bit after me and that was basically the
[2988.64 --> 2993.68]  difference was it had spread that much more and he came back on a thursday he came back on a sunday
[2993.68 --> 2999.76]  yeah and he was advised that he should self quarantine for two weeks and so uh to to i don't
[2999.76 --> 3005.76]  know i wouldn't say celebrate but to to fill the void really yeah to fill a void we needed him because
[3005.76 --> 3012.88]  brandon's on vacation so yeah we need you then so we decided to do contagion um hey can you click on
[3012.88 --> 3019.36]  our youtube channel yeah can you show can you show us show us the banner and everything sure yeah show us
[3019.36 --> 3024.88]  the thumbnails carpool critics i'm not pink you know you like that pink look at this sexy guy here
[3024.88 --> 3031.04]  and james yeah he's shooting me look at this sexy guy here and daniel radcliffe has a boat for whatever
[3031.04 --> 3037.92]  reason that was that was a weird choice doing this one i know brandon really wanted to do it though
[3037.92 --> 3043.20]  we i was happy to be that we did it actually and it actually performed pretty well all right cool i was
[3043.20 --> 3049.04]  afraid an indie movie would just this is a super experimental thing for us but like if it takes off
[3049.04 --> 3054.08]  you know hey cool it's just another way for us to kind of talk to you guys about something other
[3054.08 --> 3059.60]  than tech because believe it or not we do have lives i've been tempted at times to like you know
[3059.60 --> 3067.20]  integrate badminton into a video in some way i know uh like uh we actually had a sponsor that had this
[3067.20 --> 3074.80]  product that was like it was like a like an auto firing type of birdie dispenser no no like a robot
[3074.80 --> 3079.52]  that has an arm on it that can rack it we actually did do that video i went to china for that video
[3079.52 --> 3085.60]  oh yeah a couple years ago i watch our stuff uh yeah yeah anyway um so no it was uh it was this like
[3085.60 --> 3093.44]  all-in-one easy to use like live production kit and so it was kind of like the equivalent of a like a
[3093.44 --> 3099.84]  like a nest cam but with like us an app so it all went through your phone so you could do like live
[3099.84 --> 3104.88]  switching and stream it um and it was like all wireless or something and so i was like oh that
[3104.88 --> 3109.52]  would be pretty cool so i could just go to like my badminton night and that could be the video is
[3109.52 --> 3116.88]  using this to effectively like broadcast a badminton match anyway they they ended up pulling out i think
[3117.68 --> 3122.08]  my suspicion is that the tech just didn't actually work well enough for what we wanted to do and so
[3122.08 --> 3125.76]  they didn't want to send them to us to try it every once in a while those kinds of things will
[3125.76 --> 3128.96]  happen they'll reach out and they'll go like yeah we've got all these great capabilities and we'll be like
[3128.96 --> 3133.20]  yeah heck yeah let's use them and we'll be like oh we were actually really hoping you would just
[3133.20 --> 3139.36]  unbox it and say it's good that's really a fast moving sport maybe a a pet camera implementation
[3139.36 --> 3145.68]  would be better yeah yeah exactly um okay i should really get through our i should really get through
[3145.68 --> 3151.28]  our sponsors that actually sponsor us so vessi oh we got to do the demo i didn't wear mine today
[3152.56 --> 3157.20]  that's okay we got this i've been wondering about this demo um we're doing here we're gonna put it on
[3157.20 --> 3163.84]  the table so that we actually can they see oh uh yes i can take that lower third off do that hey
[3164.80 --> 3170.48]  got it vessi shoes are 100 waterproof using a knit material the diamantex material regulates the
[3170.48 --> 3175.76]  temperature of your feet on hot days it'll keep you cool and on cool days it'll help keep your feet warm
[3175.76 --> 3180.64]  they're flexible they stretch they're crazy light like they're super light like look i could throw this
[3180.64 --> 3185.20]  at jane i have a pair of these and i like them there'd be no danger whatsoever and check this out i'm
[3185.20 --> 3190.72]  gonna put it in water that's right i'm gonna leave this vessi shoe in water while i do also yeah
[3190.72 --> 3194.72]  sure because i've seen you do this on wanshow and when you pull it out i'm like that looks like a wet
[3194.72 --> 3200.40]  shoe no no no so i'm gonna leave it in here while we do the rest of our sponsor spots uh vessi footwear.com
[3200.40 --> 3206.16]  slash linus tech tips also sponsoring also sponsoring the show today oh you just oh you've
[3206.16 --> 3211.92]  over floated into my shoe how when you like it went over the edge when i took it out it made a wave uh yeah
[3212.48 --> 3216.80]  okay well my hands still dry whatever man you know that's sweet i didn't realize forget it my arm's
[3216.80 --> 3224.32]  wet now uh whatever it can sit there uh private internet access or no displate dang it dang it
[3224.32 --> 3230.64]  none of my lower thirds are working okay display here we go uh over 35 000 artists from 85 countries
[3230.64 --> 3235.28]  around the world have contributed to displate they have over 800 000 unique designs that number keeps going
[3235.28 --> 3241.52]  up including ones of us they plant trees when you buy dis plates they've already planted over 11 million
[3241.52 --> 3246.08]  trees they use a magnetic mounting system that decreases the risk of damaging your walls and
[3246.08 --> 3249.76]  allows you to switch between your displates very easily you'll notice we often have very different
[3249.76 --> 3254.56]  ones back there you know what we should do yes sir we should try to get like fan made ones like
[3254.56 --> 3259.52]  people should tweet out us their fan art like every week and we'll pick one and then that week that
[3259.52 --> 3264.48]  won't be the new display that's something hacksmith does a way better job than we do of of like
[3264.48 --> 3270.08]  compiling fan art they have just like binders and stuff of just this amazing fan art that people have
[3270.08 --> 3274.64]  sent them and we've had so many tons of fans not as much fan art but a lot of fan memes which i
[3274.64 --> 3281.12]  consider to be an art form by the way uh we have so many fan made memes that are just outstanding how
[3281.12 --> 3286.56]  is there not a display of the linus face yeah we what a missed opportunity we owe it to ourselves let's
[3286.56 --> 3292.08]  get that can it be the one with the gun it can be all there are no tech tips take off your clothes
[3292.08 --> 3302.72]  um a little racy but yeah well i don't like the rules uh 100 day return policy for a 100 refund
[3302.72 --> 3307.12]  which is kind of nuts and you can pick between matte and gloss finishes different sizes and frames for
[3307.12 --> 3312.64]  every artwork they've got the ltt collection you can use code ltt to save 15 at lmg.gg
[3312.64 --> 3317.92]  display when the show is also brought to you by private internet access private internet access won't
[3317.92 --> 3322.56]  do anything a vpn can't do it's not going to protect your credit cards or your passwords or your
[3322.56 --> 3327.92]  identity all on its own it's just a tool that masks your ip and encrypts traffic on your devices
[3327.92 --> 3333.92]  you need to combine it with other private browsing tools and safe practices to make even savvy websites
[3333.92 --> 3337.76]  think that you are somewhere else it can be used for all kinds of things like saving money on flights
[3338.64 --> 3344.32]  if you were to populate your plex server with movies that you didn't rip off of a blu-ray it makes
[3344.32 --> 3348.32]  it so your isp can't tell you're doing that so it does lots of good stuff but we're not going to
[3348.32 --> 3353.36]  oversell what it does their internet kill switch prevents data from leaking out if you're involuntarily
[3353.36 --> 3357.04]  disconnected and you can try it risk-free with their seven-day money-back guarantee they've got
[3357.04 --> 3361.28]  clients for windows mac os android ios and linux and you can connect up to five devices at once check
[3361.28 --> 3368.80]  them out at lmg.gg slash pia wan so you can see how the water is like beaded on there right pretty cool eh
[3370.16 --> 3373.44]  actually oh there's a little part here where it's soaked in a little bit it's not magic
[3374.08 --> 3381.20]  it's just like it's uh like it's kind of um what would you say it's still dry on the inside
[3382.00 --> 3386.24]  yeah it's still dry on the inside but like obviously eventually it'll leak but it uses the
[3386.24 --> 3391.60]  same kind of concept as like the micro hairs on a bug yeah you know where it it causes the uh
[3392.48 --> 3396.96]  the water to be i think that just means that a micro level the surface is rougher than the like um
[3397.92 --> 3402.48]  what's that there's a cool name for this like whatever whatever it's like whatever it's like
[3402.48 --> 3407.52]  what tensile strength of a bubble you know what like whatever let's talk about at least one more
[3407.52 --> 3413.20]  tech topic before we uh we should talk about dx12 because it's pretty it's pretty late uh how long
[3413.20 --> 3417.36]  have we been streaming for oh wow we've been going for an hour we did a whole wang show and talked about
[3417.36 --> 3424.08]  one tech topic darn it dx12 posted by vegetable stew on the forum on their blog microsoft calls dx12 ultimate
[3424.08 --> 3430.72]  the culmination of the best graphics technology we've ever introduced in an unprecedented alignment
[3430.72 --> 3436.80]  between pc and xbox series x that's pretty interesting actually it is pretty interesting
[3436.80 --> 3444.24]  now to be clear this is not a new api yeah it's more like a standard feature set and that was one
[3444.24 --> 3449.44]  of the problems actually starting with i think actually i don't know if it really started direct
[3449.44 --> 3457.20]  x9 even ran into this now that i think about it where you had like like 9b and 9c and there were all
[3457.20 --> 3463.44]  these kind of like optional parts of the spec that some developers would use or some graphics card makers
[3463.44 --> 3469.52]  would support and others wouldn't so basically this is like okay we're going back to basics this is
[3470.08 --> 3476.48]  direct x12 underscore two but we're going to call it direct x12 ultimate and there's branding with it
[3476.48 --> 3481.36]  too so you'll be able to buy pc components that have this branding and if you buy an xbox series x
[3482.32 --> 3488.96]  that's crucial that console is launching while this api exists i believe uh 12 came out while like
[3488.96 --> 3493.52]  halfway through the life cycle of xbox one so developers couldn't they didn't know what you
[3493.52 --> 3499.68]  can't go all in on direct x12 when you know that there's millions upon millions of devices out there
[3499.68 --> 3506.08]  that you're gonna have to do uh like a direct x11 code base for anyway so these are the features that
[3506.08 --> 3512.80]  you know you're gonna get if you have that have that branding direct x direct x ray tracing yep variable
[3512.80 --> 3518.72]  rate shading mesh shaders and sample feedback mesh shaders and sample feedback are way beyond me
[3518.72 --> 3524.48]  i don't really understand what they do have you have you tried to look into those i am especially
[3524.48 --> 3527.76]  not familiar with sampler feedback this is the kind of thing that we're probably going to have to do
[3527.76 --> 3532.00]  actually uh we should send john a memo we should do a tech quickie on this get him to look into it
[3532.00 --> 3537.84]  they're quite technical like mesh shading mesh shaders has to do with like the geometry pipeline right like
[3537.84 --> 3543.68]  but but the upshot of almost well especially those last two the up well actually all three of those
[3543.68 --> 3547.12]  other than ray tracing the upshot is that you'll be able to get more performance either by
[3547.68 --> 3551.52]  only rendering like just rendering more efficiently yeah like not rendering parts of the scene that
[3551.52 --> 3556.32]  you don't need or because it's more efficient you can render higher resolution the things that you do
[3556.32 --> 3563.28]  want to see um direct x12 ultimate is intended to serve the common baseline for both pc game development
[3563.28 --> 3569.52]  and xbox series x development thank goodness like let's just do away with bad console ports now we've got
[3569.52 --> 3576.56]  mouse and keyboard support on the xbox we've got xbox controller support on the pc there's just no excuse for like
[3576.56 --> 3580.48]  bad navigation through menus and stuff like that which makes it all the more unbelievable that i
[3580.48 --> 3586.88]  bought the master chief collection last week to play some halo combat evolved multiplayer co-op with luke
[3586.88 --> 3592.48]  on my night off and it was a hot mess like you what did they give you like a cursor that you move with
[3592.48 --> 3597.44]  your thumb stick no it's not that bad but it's just like the way some of the menus are laid out just made
[3598.00 --> 3605.60]  no sense whatsoever joining a multiplayer lobby was super unintuitive and it was really buggy no matter
[3605.60 --> 3611.44]  how many times i restarted the game restarted my system rebound the action either to defaults or to
[3611.44 --> 3615.92]  something else that i had assigned there was no way for me to swap my weapon so i was stuck with the
[3615.92 --> 3621.76]  stupid assault rifle the entire time and i would i would i would look down at the weapon i want to pick
[3621.76 --> 3627.84]  up and it would say hold whatever i had assigned to swap weapons and no amount of doing it would
[3627.84 --> 3633.04]  make it work fortunately we were just kind of dicking around anyway so we uh yeah well that's what you're
[3633.04 --> 3639.92]  relegated to yeah the secret cartographer level um we managed to get the warthog all the way down to
[3639.92 --> 3646.72]  the map room oh my god yeah yeah i have i have that brings me back i have screen capture it's amazing we're
[3646.72 --> 3653.28]  basically pulled up to it like a drive-through because i um i like hit it and then i mean old
[3653.28 --> 3659.84]  games right like just the way that they worked was kind of more cobbled together so i activated it and
[3659.84 --> 3665.04]  then there must be some kind of a delay between activating it while the cutscene like switches to
[3665.04 --> 3671.12]  cutscene mode or whatever but i was able to turn and get into the hog so i'm like hanging there in the
[3671.12 --> 3676.64]  driver's seat in the cutscene in the cutscene in the cutscene in engine cutscene in the warthog with the
[3676.64 --> 3681.36]  secret cartographer looking like like a drive-through like a drive-through window that's awesome yeah
[3681.36 --> 3687.44]  did you ever play elder scrolls morrowind i didn't get into morrowind that one was jank there was a
[3687.44 --> 3691.92]  bunch of really steep hills that you're not supposed to walk up or climb but if you just keep hitting
[3691.92 --> 3696.56]  jump while you do it you can just like glitch your way up your way up and get into these stupid spots
[3697.20 --> 3705.20]  amazing someone out there has the same childhood as me um all right sorry did i say secret cartographer
[3705.20 --> 3710.16]  silent cartographer sorry sorry that sounded weird um yeah oh yeah we should do some super chats if
[3710.16 --> 3715.20]  you need to go that's totally fine i don't really do you think that games by the way gamestop all these
[3715.20 --> 3720.00]  stores are closing they've been ordered to close gamestop is like you know what we're not closing
[3720.00 --> 3725.76]  all of you chains you stay open and if the cops hassle you show them this memo where we uh claim that
[3725.76 --> 3730.16]  we are an essential service because people are staying home and working remotely and they need to put
[3730.16 --> 3734.56]  they need our software they need games to play when they're remote and we're staying open this is
[3734.56 --> 3740.00]  ridiculous if you work there it's like we believe gamestop is classified as essential retail and
[3740.00 --> 3746.16]  therefore is able to remain open during this time the retailer said in a memo to staff are you for real
[3746.16 --> 3752.32]  gamestop you are the least essential thing no offense i think they're probably like we will go out of
[3752.32 --> 3758.48]  business which is a fair point but like apparently this has been updated and the california stores are
[3758.48 --> 3764.80]  closed okay there you go uh oh interesting apparently people lined up at eb games today
[3764.80 --> 3770.16]  to buy animal crossing and doom in toronto yeah really i think you had to have it pre-ordered though
[3771.36 --> 3776.40]  why are people like oh man animal crossing bro yeah you know who was saying they were gonna play
[3776.40 --> 3780.56]  a bunch of animal was it riley that i was talking to the other day he was he was making some animal
[3780.56 --> 3785.84]  crossing references today yeah i think so or it could have been um did you play it i have never played
[3785.84 --> 3789.36]  it's one of those games where people explain it to you and you're like i don't get it this is stupid
[3789.36 --> 3794.88]  and then you play it and you're like i'm not putting this down for 80 hours this weekend huh
[3794.88 --> 3800.40]  okay i don't need another game like that i played six hours of ano last night oh yeah i was up until
[3800.40 --> 3807.68]  like 3 30 in the morning because you get engineers uh oh oh i've i've got investors now nice yeah um did
[3807.68 --> 3814.64]  you play uh uh silent moon i never did animal crossing is kind of close to silent moon okay well that
[3814.64 --> 3817.92]  doesn't do me any good does it because i never played either well you know what farm though
[3817.92 --> 3822.80]  harvest moon i said they say silent oh i never plays yeah i don't know what is that we're both
[3822.80 --> 3828.80]  silent cartographer secret harvest oh my god
[3831.68 --> 3837.76]  we've got a hidden message here linus has a small dick you know what fine let's uh let's uh let's go
[3837.76 --> 3841.44]  ahead and show this one oh no it's got a bunch of other junk in it but you know what i'm not gonna hide
[3841.44 --> 3849.12]  it i'm not gonna hide it uh it's got an asian wife uh yeah i don't want to do i need yeah it's all
[3849.12 --> 3855.76]  relative baby uh robert mayhel says just closed on a house what are some good it slash life quality of
[3855.76 --> 3862.56]  life improvements for family and kids good wi-fi you know what i spend a thousand dollars on a wi-fi
[3862.56 --> 3869.76]  access point like four years ago or really whatever really i bought a ruckus r700 i spent my own money on
[3869.76 --> 3874.72]  it so many people were like this is so sponsored no one would ever do that actually lots of people
[3874.72 --> 3879.04]  do them they're for commercial deployments or lots of people do that it's for commercial deployments
[3879.04 --> 3885.92]  it was the best quality of life improvement that i have made technologically ever and i would
[3886.72 --> 3892.64]  definitely say with confidence that going back especially now that the performance leaps per
[3892.64 --> 3898.48]  generation are not that big i as someone who previously would upgrade every generation i would say
[3898.48 --> 3903.84]  i would skip a generational upgrade and i would upgrade my wi-fi instead i would go back and i
[3903.84 --> 3912.00]  would do that 100 percent wow because the difference between crappy consumer wi-fi that drops out or has
[3912.00 --> 3918.64]  crappy coverage versus an enterprise wi-fi hotspot especially at the time when i was doing a lot of
[3919.20 --> 3925.84]  game stream on my nvidia shield night and day just the amount of frustration and like just like hey you
[3925.84 --> 3929.84]  know the wi-fi is cutting out like calling me when i'm on a business trip like i can't deal with that
[3929.84 --> 3935.04]  okay so for robert good wi-fi what use case uh does he have to have for that to be worth it for him like
[3935.04 --> 3940.88]  if it's only him and his partner and no kids and if he's not like uh he's not game streaming depends
[3940.88 --> 3946.56]  on the size of the house i would say good wi-fi is like like if you have a house guest over and you
[3946.56 --> 3952.00]  have like crappy wi-fi do you feel obligated do you feel do you feel obligated to apologize for
[3952.00 --> 3958.16]  the crap wi-fi in the like guest room i would maybe like that sucks like how are they supposed
[3958.16 --> 3962.80]  to maybe they don't want to talk to you for you know a couple hours you know you're a nice guy james
[3962.80 --> 3967.36]  but i need a break needs me time you know can't go watch my netflix on my phone that sucks i can't
[3967.36 --> 3973.44]  really relate because most millennials don't have guest rooms yeah fat cat fat cat don't eat me please
[3973.44 --> 3977.52]  i would say get a bidet if you've never used one of those you've heard of the bidets they have in
[3977.52 --> 3983.60]  korea and japan if you've never used one i would say get one i i would get them for like 30 bucks what
[3983.60 --> 3990.00]  yeah the one well okay you don't have to get a super fancy one okay let me tell my story i went to
[3990.00 --> 3995.44]  southeast asia fine where they don't have the fancy bidets but they use like what i call some people
[3995.44 --> 4001.20]  call a bum gun i call it butthose basically looks like the vegetable sprayer yeah okay by your kitchen sink
[4001.20 --> 4005.12]  yeah it's by the toilet you grab it you spray your butt i thought that was amazing i was like
[4005.12 --> 4010.00]  this is better than toilet paper it's like zero waste and uh it's cool you could argue it's more
[4010.00 --> 4015.44]  hygienic so i got one in my house yeah it's a little different in canada because it's not a tropical
[4015.44 --> 4021.20]  country where you kind of just dry off really quickly but i i we use reusable diaper so it sprays out
[4021.20 --> 4027.20]  it has multiple functions however i was pretty satisfied with this bum gun bum gun dennis comes over
[4027.20 --> 4031.28]  and i'm like you're gonna love this as an asian i got your setup in there you're gonna love this
[4031.28 --> 4036.96]  he goes he goes in there he's like what the hell is this no one uses these it's certain they only use
[4036.96 --> 4041.44]  it in the like indonesia and thailand and philippines and stuff if you're from like taiwan like
[4041.44 --> 4046.96]  dennis like they have the good one they have a throne i went to a hotel yeah in in victoria and used
[4046.96 --> 4053.36]  a good one and they range from like 300 to like 1500 dollars and first of all have you sat on a heated
[4053.36 --> 4058.08]  seat oh yeah it's amazing because you have like i've traveled in japan you have muscle memory for
[4058.08 --> 4062.24]  like when i hit the seat it's gonna be a little cold shock and when you're surprised and that
[4062.24 --> 4066.72]  expectation is subverted and it's warm you're like whoa this is a game changer and then like the water is
[4066.72 --> 4073.60]  warm and like it blows dries your butt it's sweet i i had to get uh a shuttle picked me up uh from the
[4073.60 --> 4081.12]  airport when i went to japan for the uh the omron factory tour and the shuttle driver uh didn't speak
[4081.12 --> 4085.60]  a lick of english so when i had to go to the bathroom halfway through this like two hour drive
[4086.40 --> 4093.36]  i it was real hard for me to communicate i was like you know uh you know toilet like i don't know
[4093.36 --> 4097.60]  i was just i was like trying to mind what i needed to do so he pulls over at what is essentially as far
[4097.60 --> 4106.32]  as i can tell like a greyhound station like not like nothing really around it i go into the bathroom
[4106.32 --> 4110.80]  at this thing so the building is like the crappiest facilities you would expect it's like
[4111.68 --> 4116.80]  i would expect the bathroom to kind of smell i would expect it to smell like urinal cake at best
[4116.80 --> 4121.84]  right okay it wasn't like a disgusting building or anything but like i wasn't expecting a nice
[4121.84 --> 4127.76]  bathroom the toilet was the nicest toilet i had ever sat on in my life because this is my first
[4127.76 --> 4133.76]  japanese toilet i was like it had a heated seat i couldn't believe it it's mind-blowing that this
[4133.76 --> 4139.28]  hasn't taken off in the west and the funny thing is like you don't even you don't even need um like
[4139.28 --> 4143.12]  toilet paper and a bidet don't necessarily have to be entirely mutually exclusive but you can
[4143.12 --> 4149.04]  dramatically cut down on the amount of toilet paper that you use with a bidet oh dude we have this in
[4149.04 --> 4153.92]  our wanshow notes there's a thing on here because of all the hoarding that's been going on with toilet
[4153.92 --> 4159.44]  paper there someone made this awesome website where you can like calculate how long your stash of
[4159.44 --> 4166.32]  toilet paper is going to last you it's at the bottom okay here i'll i'll go to your screen okay sure i have to
[4166.32 --> 4173.68]  plug it in oh all right hold on how much toilet paper dot com how much toilet paper dot com okay my
[4173.68 --> 4181.28]  wife she doesn't even how many squares do you use do you know the number it's i would say okay depends
[4182.24 --> 4186.00]  it just depends yeah yeah yeah it depends um
[4186.00 --> 4188.40]  um
[4188.48 --> 4196.80]  i don't know you don't know 10 10 or 20. what you just go like i don't know okay hold on what would
[4196.80 --> 4203.12]  10 be it's like like that long okay so that's probably more like five or six dude i fold over
[4203.12 --> 4209.04]  i i don't i don't like to risk yeah you fold over but you can do that with two dude i'm rocking two and
[4209.04 --> 4212.96]  when i was really when i was really aggressive with this you can do with one you do the fold
[4212.96 --> 4218.72]  you do the fold around two fingers man that is unethical of you that is all right i'm being shamed
[4218.72 --> 4224.16]  that's obscene 10. i'm being shamed here that's fine anyway you can go onto this website you can
[4224.16 --> 4227.60]  enter how many rolls you have and how many toilet visits per day and it's going to tell you how long
[4227.60 --> 4233.84]  your hoard is going to last and it looks like the default here is when it says 375 of your quarantine
[4233.84 --> 4239.52]  it's there to shame people who hoarded but these are these uh dimensions are just not enough you
[4239.52 --> 4244.48]  need to hit advanced options and you can get into squares per wipe every number of wipes per trip
[4244.48 --> 4249.92]  sheets per one current value too that is just that's for people like me but i guess
[4249.92 --> 4253.44]  does this scale even go high enough for linus there you go 10 max out
[4254.72 --> 4260.64]  shame 10 is too much that would clog the toilet so i okay i don't pay that close attention i was
[4260.64 --> 4264.88]  wanting to tell a story about how my wife just like grabs like a mitt and dabs herself with it
[4264.88 --> 4274.24]  and then you're just like her unbelievable grabs a mitt fat cats um please don't eat me um all
[4274.24 --> 4279.44]  right so wow that was a long super chat response we're gonna have to go a little bit more quickly
[4279.44 --> 4284.72]  here uh ben quigley says ltt folding team leader thanks for the shout out yeah they shouted out wrong
[4284.72 --> 4290.08]  last week they called out the pc master race folding team those guys have got like four times as many
[4290.08 --> 4294.32]  folders as us let's go boys someone tagged me on the forum being like pcmr is slaying right now we
[4294.32 --> 4300.00]  need more help it's like yeah let's do this team ltt like i don't know if you guys know this but the
[4300.00 --> 4308.08]  ltt forum has a huge folding team like we are significant join the team um billy c are you excited
[4308.08 --> 4315.84]  about half-life alex i am as non-hyped about half-life alex as i think a vr enthusiast could possibly
[4315.84 --> 4321.36]  are you a half-life enthusiast i liked half-life 2 i played it all the way through did you play the
[4321.36 --> 4326.64]  first one um i did not play the first one i wasn't really into pc gaming yet at that point yeah okay
[4327.20 --> 4331.76]  um and i tried to play it like after playing half-life 2 i was like oh yeah half-life 2 i'm sick
[4332.40 --> 4339.84]  i was like oh yeah this is not as good um which makes sense i mean half-life 2 was like great i guess
[4339.84 --> 4345.84]  for me as not already a fan of half the half-life franchise with those those memories with that
[4345.84 --> 4354.56]  nostalgia for it i was so much more impressed by far cry because it came out of nowhere launched like
[4354.56 --> 4361.76]  months before like half-life 2 kept getting delayed uh doom 3 was i don't remember if doom 3 got delayed
[4361.76 --> 4368.48]  but like basically it was all the media i think i think doom did was doom 3 half-life 2 this is going to be
[4368.48 --> 4377.52]  amazing and then out of nowhere this tiny scrappy cry tech delivers arguably and equally visually
[4377.52 --> 4384.72]  beautiful just way ahead of its time game with this kind of free roaming level design i thought for i
[4384.72 --> 4391.92]  played way more far cry than i did half-life 2. is that game related to fear remember fear i loved fear
[4391.92 --> 4396.56]  the first one was great that was one of the first ones with havoc or was it i remember the physics being
[4396.56 --> 4400.80]  like unreal in fear i don't remember i'm sorry yeah i don't remember if it was one of the first with
[4400.80 --> 4406.48]  havoc um i'm gonna pick that up piece of more for not playing half-life yeah i'm sorry i mean i you
[4406.48 --> 4410.16]  know what i'll play the remake didn't that black mesa project or whatever it's called there's like
[4410.16 --> 4415.92]  yeah there's like a reskin of it in source engine i do want to try it wow you can tell how tired i am
[4415.92 --> 4420.56]  today that i was up all night because i get like these kind of rings around my face where were you doing i was
[4420.56 --> 4425.44]  up uh playing anna oh yeah right no i played for six hours yesterday after i put the kids to bed i
[4425.44 --> 4428.80]  was like i'm gonna go play anna for a bit oh when you hate yourself when you look at the clock and
[4428.80 --> 4432.48]  you're like that's too late but you keep playing and you know what i was talking about cutting a lot
[4432.48 --> 4436.24]  of junk food out of my diet i ate an ice cream bar while i was sitting there those are nothing
[4436.24 --> 4440.80]  one of the mini ones though the little heggendass ones are nothing those are like irresistible to me
[4440.80 --> 4446.88]  i love ice cream sandwiches the almond the almond caramel one that's like slight salted caramel almond
[4446.88 --> 4451.52]  peggendass bar i talked to my local grocery store because a lot of the time they don't have it in
[4451.52 --> 4457.52]  stock and that's the only time i buy it because they don't carry that flavor at costco thank goodness
[4457.52 --> 4461.28]  because if i bought a costco thing of it and it was like there in my freezer watching me
[4461.28 --> 4466.24]  but anyway i only allow myself to buy one box at a time which is three bars and then only when i
[4466.24 --> 4472.48]  shop which i i don't shop that often my job is laundry and yvonne does the shopping i just i i hate
[4473.04 --> 4477.92]  grocery shopping oh really i can't do it like i i don't like laundry either but i was like look
[4477.92 --> 4483.36]  i will do all the laundry in this house if i never have to go grocery shopping um laundry's so easy
[4484.00 --> 4489.04]  well well i guess folding yeah it's easy yeah i fold and then i have to supervise kids putting it
[4489.04 --> 4492.88]  away so i don't actually have to put it away but putting it away would be easier than like making them
[4492.88 --> 4498.08]  do it if it was actually my chore and i had to put away my wife's clothes folding women's clothing is
[4498.08 --> 4502.40]  sucks it's all oddly shaped you're like what do you do with this i can't even tell what this is it's like
[4502.40 --> 4506.96]  some weird shawl like what drawer does this go in so i actually don't put her laundry away no
[4506.96 --> 4512.48]  i supervise the kids i do mine my laundry is so simple if it goes on the top it goes there if it
[4512.48 --> 4516.32]  goes on the bottom it goes there if it goes under either of those two things it goes here and here
[4517.36 --> 4522.32]  that's it we have the same dresser my friend i know right i used to have no dresser that was
[4522.32 --> 4528.96]  the move there's no folding at all you just go hanger hanger it's way better really if you have
[4528.96 --> 4533.20]  a closet for it it would take up a ton of space wouldn't it i lived alone okay fair enough yeah
[4533.20 --> 4538.96]  all right uh what were we even talking about half-life alex i think oh yeah right so i still
[4538.96 --> 4544.24]  right i sat i hated myself what okay yeah anyway half-life alex no i'm i'm i'm actually not that
[4544.24 --> 4548.32]  excited about it like i played episode one i played episode two i really excited when it's here
[4548.32 --> 4552.56]  they were like good but i don't i you're gonna get it you're gonna get it though right i thought
[4552.56 --> 4560.08]  portal was better than any of them there that's not a hot take portal's great part is a great game
[4560.08 --> 4566.08]  fantastic um i found half-life 2 a little bit repetitive apparently the especially the bit where
[4566.08 --> 4571.12]  you're firing around the saw blades in that like creepy village or whatever oh yeah there's that we
[4571.12 --> 4576.00]  don't go to raven yeah or whatever yeah i yeah i ended up getting kind of bored at parts of it but i
[4576.00 --> 4579.20]  like really wanted to beat it and like some of the segments where you're like going around on the
[4579.20 --> 4583.36]  bridge i think it is you know like kind of going okay go up this and then over here and like that
[4583.36 --> 4589.76]  you know it's like a lot of hiking around uh and i played trespasser never played trespasser a lot
[4589.76 --> 4595.12]  of hiking oh you know what that game is no oh it's basically like a jurassic park game it's old it's
[4595.68 --> 4602.96]  old old old 90s um i'm gonna play it though because i get it for free with my index so like oh nice i'll
[4602.96 --> 4611.84]  play it for sure one more uh yeah yeah yeah one more sorry guys um somebody only says you play on
[4611.84 --> 4616.00]  the index a lot have you dealt with it not getting recognized all like 50 of the time i have to like
[4616.00 --> 4621.36]  restart headset after i launch steam vr no apparent reason doesn't matter if i like activate the
[4621.36 --> 4626.24]  controllers first or like i don't know it's been like that basically forever that reminds me of android
[4626.24 --> 4632.80]  auto oh i love android auto but man it's so buggy sometimes sometimes i get in the car and it just
[4632.80 --> 4638.56]  like i can feel the phone go like the phone knows but then the the car doesn't it only happens in the
[4638.56 --> 4644.56]  one car that i have so brutal thanks richard joy sorry i'm just doing like some of the really big
[4644.56 --> 4650.56]  ones because i feel really bad if i miss those um jaff tech says we started a new gym a few months ago
[4650.56 --> 4656.00]  this is affecting us a lot we're offering online personal training oh that's a pretty cool idea good for
[4656.00 --> 4662.32]  you yeah way to adapt astio okay last one astier says feathers or nylon linus
[4665.44 --> 4672.56]  excuse me okay okay someone called me okay somebody called me low-key racist or something like that
[4672.56 --> 4678.00]  earlier when i was talking about white people badminton when i say white people badminton i mean like
[4678.64 --> 4686.08]  like american like north american perception of what badminton is like i i mean have you ever heard
[4686.08 --> 4690.64]  of the book stuff white people like oh that was a shuttlecock reference the nylon i thought it was like a
[4690.64 --> 4695.76]  fetish thing i was like no no no no no no okay so stuff white people like is this this book slash blog
[4695.76 --> 4702.40]  from like ages ago and it's like yeah stereotypical like like suburban freaking white people um so white
[4702.40 --> 4707.04]  people those white people think that badminton is this game that you play in the backyard like this
[4707.04 --> 4713.20]  like croquet yeah yeah and the shuttle's like this big and it's like floppy and like has a big like
[4713.20 --> 4720.40]  you know rainbow colored you know fuzzy like foam ball on the end and like that's not the sport that i
[4720.40 --> 4727.20]  play now to be clear there are some places where people with white colored skin do take badminton very
[4727.20 --> 4733.68]  seriously denmark for example has arguably oh like that jersey in your office yeah that's uh peter
[4733.68 --> 4741.04]  gada who's uh was a real innovator when it came to uh like trickery on the court um trick shots and he
[4741.04 --> 4745.52]  just had a really interesting are you saying that white people do it the best uh no you are racist
[4746.40 --> 4752.00]  anyway so victor axelson really big player for denmark right now arguably one of the best he just won a
[4752.00 --> 4756.80]  big tournament over in the uk there are some british badminton players that are really good but
[4756.80 --> 4764.40]  the powerhouses for badminton are china um malaysia actually they've got an up-and-coming player that
[4764.40 --> 4768.00]  might be able to take lee chong way's place but i was going to say maybe not so much for the next
[4768.00 --> 4774.48]  little bit but indonesia it's huge india absolutely huge so it's mostly it's more of a southeast asian
[4775.28 --> 4780.56]  thing um so that's what i mean it's like playing for realsies those are south asian countries bro
[4780.56 --> 4786.56]  um yeah that's true india's not southeast um that's a fair point but it's like it's huge in
[4786.56 --> 4793.44]  southeast asia absolutely huge it's really big in taiwan as well uh korea do they now obviously um
[4793.44 --> 4798.48]  table tennis ping pong is huge in china as well do they have like all the racket sports are huge
[4798.48 --> 4803.84]  there like squash and stuff you know i have no idea um i mean the thing about china pickleball you've
[4803.84 --> 4809.84]  got over a billion people pickleballs for old people how about it how about it it's fun have you
[4809.84 --> 4814.72]  played no oh it's a blast it seems uh like it's really accessible yeah they used to uh they used to
[4814.72 --> 4819.44]  move the nets down after one of my badminton sessions at the rec center like 10 years ago and
[4819.44 --> 4823.28]  my doubles partner and i would stay sometimes and play with the seniors because they would bring the
[4823.28 --> 4826.96]  nets down and switch it over to pickleball like right after the badminton session nice cool down for
[4826.96 --> 4833.52]  you i actually uh yvonne and i found this great site that's like it was like 150 things to do on a date
[4833.52 --> 4838.16]  and we were like you know it'd be fun if we do all of these things oh cool like one by one we're just
[4838.16 --> 4843.12]  we're just gonna do them all so one of them was how hard you get uh well we were just starting okay yeah but one
[4843.12 --> 4847.44]  of them was sign up for a class together and we were like okay why don't we do a pickleball class
[4847.44 --> 4852.72]  because that's like you know fun it's something we know enough about racket sports that we wouldn't
[4852.72 --> 4857.60]  be complete derp idiots but you know we'd still be learning something new and they literally didn't
[4857.60 --> 4862.88]  have a session that wasn't like in the middle of the day oh wow because it's it really is just
[4863.60 --> 4870.40]  like seniors only like all the promotional imagery was all you know senior citizens i was like okay well
[4870.40 --> 4874.56]  i guess we don't have to play that game i really didn't want to play i wanted to take a class with
[4874.56 --> 4880.40]  my wife one time and i was like how will it dance i've used i've done dance classes in the past and
[4880.40 --> 4888.08]  she was like i'd rather die and like we were closer to taking calculus together really than dance
[4889.36 --> 4894.96]  ouch maybe it's just she doesn't want to dance with you no i've seen her we met on a dance floor
[4894.96 --> 4899.12]  did you her the extent of her dance is jumping she'll just jump up and down okay so she could
[4899.12 --> 4904.40]  like go to a simple plan concert and not look out of place but beyond that not really yeah maybe
[4905.60 --> 4910.56]  more likely to find her in like vegas or ibiza she used to be in the edm back in the day all right
[4911.84 --> 4919.04]  yeah so in answer in response to your question feather shuttles um although that might change
[4919.04 --> 4924.64]  they've actually got a synthetic feather shuttle that they are uh trialing in top level tournaments that
[4924.64 --> 4931.28]  apparently offers 25 percent better durability so they'll go through they'll go through a lot
[4931.28 --> 4936.72]  fewer of them and apparently plays almost identically i haven't tried one i really really want to try a
[4936.72 --> 4945.36]  synthetic shuttle or synthetic feather shuttle apparently flies just about identically and um should be a
[4945.36 --> 4951.76]  lot less traumatic for the geese so they'd be cheaper feather shuttles are made they're handmade which is
[4951.76 --> 4957.28]  like it's kind of shocking that you can get them for like two dollars and fifty cents or whatever
[4957.28 --> 4962.32]  each when you're trying to baby when you look at them um but they are they're handmade and it's
[4962.32 --> 4969.60]  only from the feathers from the left wing of a goose left only the left why the reason is that it affects
[4969.60 --> 4973.36]  the aerodynamics of the shuttle and the way that it spins oh you want all of them to be consistent they
[4973.36 --> 4977.44]  all spin like one right so they're they don't kill the geese but they do pluck them live and that's
[4977.44 --> 4983.52]  apparently traumatic pretty sounds pretty bad pretty traumatic that sounds pretty 10 out of 10 terrible
[4983.52 --> 4988.48]  can you imagine like a goose farm that's just like well what do you do with it so you pick all the
[4988.48 --> 4994.32]  feathers out of their left arm and then what you like foie gras yeah i were i don't know if you let
[4994.32 --> 5000.64]  them grow back or do you think the geese are just like please the other arm please just once the other
[5000.64 --> 5006.40]  wing yeah i don't know this one's so calloused yeah i don't know man anyway uh so thanks for uh
[5006.40 --> 5012.32]  that's that's it for the wan show guys uh it's time for us to go home and enjoy our weekend inside
