[0.00 --> 11.90]  oh okay hey what's up guys welcome to the when show we've got a spectacular show for y'all today
[11.90 --> 19.20]  there is so much news to talk about there was an apple event this week there was the launch of the
[19.20 --> 26.50]  rtx 3080 sort of because sort of good luck buying one there was uh what else we got here luke what
[26.50 --> 30.90]  you want to talk about price was announced oh we're definitely going to be talking about that
[30.90 --> 35.62]  okay okay hold on hold on hold on hold on i swear i'm gonna let us run the intro in a second here
[35.62 --> 45.34]  just give me a score out of 10 for the ps5 pricing score out of 10 uh one out of 10 okay i like it i
[45.34 --> 48.88]  like it we'll get into more depth into that later ladies and gentlemen what else we got
[48.88 --> 57.34]  uh did i give two uh no no no come on go for it go for the one wechat officially really in the u.s
[57.34 --> 62.36]  that's a headline compared to you already talked about you already talked about this no i didn't
[62.36 --> 67.96]  you said nvidia stuff no but not that are we giving nvidia two headlining well they've got two
[67.96 --> 75.74]  headlines they killed sli they got the good headline i mean that like it was already dead you know what
[75.74 --> 80.96]  luke i've had i've had enough of your i'm not gonna i'm not gonna bleep myself swearing because i got
[80.96 --> 87.18]  part of the monetization disabled on a last wan show because i had too much bleep swearing in the
[87.18 --> 92.18]  first 30 seconds of the video so i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna roll the intro then i'm gonna talk about
[92.18 --> 93.52]  how i feel about that
[93.52 --> 100.18]  all right all right all right
[100.18 --> 118.76]  wait hold on a second rip ruth bader ginsburg no way am i am i this far am i this far out of
[118.76 --> 127.18]  the loop msi conquer the battlefield backblaze conquer the back up your storage that's right i said
[127.18 --> 133.38]  coupon what are you gonna do about it you and i uh are apparently that far out of the loop
[133.38 --> 143.70]  really yep no way when uh it's it looked like hours ago nope minutes minutes ago
[143.70 --> 156.40]  cnn posted 35 minutes ago new york times eight minutes ago wow okay uh sorry guys i uh
[156.40 --> 167.68]  i'm sorry i'm just i'm just finding this out now crazy all right then uh in other news uh technology
[167.68 --> 175.60]  um wow okay you were gonna yell at me for sli stuff yes i was you know what let's jump
[175.60 --> 179.16]  right into that one i don't even remember what the title of the stream is today
[179.16 --> 186.98]  nvidia rtx 3080 scalpers are jerks should we do that first no do the headline no we are talking
[186.98 --> 195.12]  about nvidia sli i'm getting my display capture going here i gotta read oh oh i just moved i just
[195.12 --> 201.38]  moved the luke source if see if this okay there we go nvidia sli are you gonna hover your mouse over it
[201.38 --> 209.86]  again transitioning support is transitioning that's another way of saying being being dead and buried
[209.86 --> 215.22]  to native game integrations you're not even gonna you're pulling a linus here you're not even letting
[215.22 --> 223.24]  me talk fine because you go then you go title of nvidia quietly kills sli this is like if if nvidia is
[223.24 --> 229.58]  getting the credit for killing sli it's a kill steal it's a kill steal so who are you giving the credit
[229.58 --> 241.00]  for killing sli microsoft um well direct x12 doesn't exactly like yours you think reviewers killed
[241.00 --> 249.08]  sli kind of like very justifiably like they earned it and it was good and people should be happy
[249.08 --> 254.86]  people should be happy pushing sli for a long time when it was a giant steaming pile of garbage
[254.86 --> 260.06]  okay it was terrible okay it sucked and they were still pushing it because they were like yeah
[260.06 --> 264.98]  buy four graphics cards and reviewers were like this is dumb this is stupid don't do it
[264.98 --> 271.52]  um we we started releasing the i don't even remember what it was called uh compensator
[271.52 --> 276.90]  compensator yeah we started releasing that to just like basically make fun of sli that was almost the
[276.90 --> 284.36]  entire point of those videos that's true we we released other we also made fun of extreme editions
[284.36 --> 290.08]  and overpriced motherboards and power supplies yeah but those weren't the reasons why the system like
[290.08 --> 296.26]  literally performed worse than other systems that was the fun true well sometimes they did sometimes
[296.26 --> 303.38]  the big multi-core extreme editions did actually perform worse than the yeah than the the lower
[303.38 --> 310.96]  threaded consumer chips yeah yeah that's true but it was and absolutely but it was mostly trashing on sli
[310.96 --> 316.52]  um yes and and this has been like a theme this was a theme for us this was a theme for other reviewers
[316.52 --> 323.16]  for a very long time while nvidia was still pushing it then like basically the whole industry just stopped
[323.16 --> 328.94]  i don't think very many people were pushing sli at all i saw a lot less of it in enthusiast builds
[328.94 --> 336.96]  it basically didn't exist anymore and now they're they're pulling support for it it's already dead
[336.96 --> 343.68]  it's it's it's that maybe maybe they're pulling the plug but it's been on like life support with no
[343.68 --> 351.66]  visitors for a long time okay so here's here's why i'm bummed and you'll have to forgive me for maybe
[351.66 --> 360.18]  making some assumptions here but i'm bummed because it feels like nvidia is pulling sli support
[360.18 --> 371.78]  at the point in its history where it is more likely than ever to work well okay over the over the last
[371.78 --> 379.10]  couple of generations over the last few generations actually nvidia has taken the sli interface
[379.10 --> 389.72]  are you done now are you done laughing at me all right no i'm not laughing i actually it's a funny
[389.72 --> 395.62]  comment because it's true so nvidia has taken the sli interface which used to be let's see high
[395.62 --> 403.76]  bandwidth was 650 megahertz uh the older one ran at a slower 400 megahertz how much actual bandwidth was
[403.76 --> 411.72]  this standard bridge support sli maximum theoretical here we go so at 400 megahertz it could do uh two
[411.72 --> 419.70]  gigabytes per second in dual channel that's that's not very fast by contrast the latest uh iteration
[419.70 --> 428.24]  of nvlink so if we were to actually say okay look what we really need for sli to work better is a
[428.24 --> 433.92]  much higher bandwidth interface between the gpus so they can share uh you know frame buffer information
[433.92 --> 443.30]  or whatever the case may be well we were we were already there dang it nvlink 3.0 is 50 gigabit per
[443.30 --> 449.44]  second it's like over the last few generations they've taken that two gigabyte per second they've gone to
[449.44 --> 457.62]  two and a half three point something and six point something like come on they're they've actually
[457.62 --> 463.00]  got it to the point where like quadros can share memory they can they can actually pool memory and
[463.00 --> 468.34]  work on like compute workloads together on a workstation i know it's not the same thing luke i'm
[468.34 --> 474.32]  just saying it seems like if they'd actually been dedicated to it instead of building you know the
[474.32 --> 480.46]  world's premier ai computing company that i think they could have solved it that's all i'm saying
[480.46 --> 488.64]  that's it yeah i i agree a lot of the productivity style things don't need like sli to use both graphics
[488.64 --> 494.72]  cards um no but nvlink allows them to share their memory it allows them to pool their memory so you can
[494.72 --> 501.94]  work on much much larger workloads so where's that from my games i just want that from my games
[501.94 --> 511.04]  i want to i want to play 12k uh flight simulator dot um so from the blog post should we at least run
[511.04 --> 515.84]  through what this means because if you have an sli system that this doesn't necessarily mean that
[515.84 --> 522.52]  immediately you're gonna lose any performance benefit you would have gotten so okay well look
[522.52 --> 528.56]  some games had a performance benefit man you're such a jerk for someone who has sli graphics cards
[528.56 --> 534.70]  you sure are hating on people with sli graphics cards an awful awful hard here i didn't even ask
[534.70 --> 540.02]  for them and technically right now i don't because because you told emma she could have one of mine and
[540.02 --> 547.92]  now it's in her system did i really oh i did do that didn't i yeah i'm awesome i'm hilarious okay
[547.92 --> 553.68]  all right so back to back to back to the blog post with the emergence of low-level graphics apis such as
[553.68 --> 558.58]  direct x12 and vulcan game developers are able to implement sli support natively within the game
[558.58 --> 562.36]  itself instead of relying upon an sli driver profile which is just another way of saying
[562.36 --> 569.72]  that it's a percent of a what it's a one percent of one percent of users and game developers would
[569.72 --> 576.44]  basically be idiots to spend actual dev cycles on implementing this unless the intent of their game
[576.44 --> 581.46]  is for it to be used as as a benchmark you know if you're some if you're working on something like a
[581.46 --> 587.96]  crisis remastered or whatever so hence nvidia will no longer be adding new sli driver profiles on rtx 20
[587.96 --> 593.90]  series and earlier gpus starting on january 1st 2021 instead we will focus efforts on supporting
[593.90 --> 600.84]  developers to implement sli natively inside the game so that's clearly clearly not happening at all
[600.84 --> 609.64]  yeah then there's a uh oh man so for geforce rtx 3090 remember rtx 3090 is still sli ready they just
[609.64 --> 616.36]  shipped like like right days before this blog post went up the first reviewers would have been hands
[616.36 --> 625.72]  on with rtx 3090 they just shipped an sli capable gpu um and they're saying so for that sli will only
[625.72 --> 631.18]  be supported when implemented natively within the game so that's fine because there's a big long list
[631.18 --> 638.38]  of game titles that you can enjoy here in the blog post such hits as zombie army 4 dead war
[638.38 --> 647.50]  strange brigade okay most most of these are somewhat recognizable so we got shadow the tomb raider
[647.50 --> 654.16]  civ 6 sniper elite 4th civ 6 like okay sure gears in war 4 ashes of singularity escalation lots of
[654.16 --> 659.32]  people played that game it was big esports title uh rise of the tomb raider hitman day sex mankind
[659.32 --> 664.48]  divided halo wars 2 battlefield 1 and then vulcan games that support it are red dead redemption 2
[664.48 --> 671.14]  okay that's like i i would say that that qualifies as as like a triple a title legit then we've got
[671.14 --> 676.62]  quake 2 rtx ashes of singularity strange brigade zombie army 4 dead war so we have red dead redemption
[676.62 --> 683.74]  2 benchmark benchmark other more different benchmark yeah yeah and deus ex yeah
[683.74 --> 696.06]  oh well okay i have been preaching for a long time that you are far better off just you know getting
[696.06 --> 703.90]  one better gpu than two slower ones and ever since you know video's been trying to price it that way
[703.90 --> 711.34]  anyways so yep ever since like nvidia and uh gaming media and consumers in general woke up to the
[711.34 --> 717.94]  importance of frame times compared to frame rates yeah and we figured out how to actually quantify the
[717.94 --> 725.52]  micro stuttering that mostly people just felt beforehand um there's been a big shift away from
[725.52 --> 732.94]  dual or especially triple or quadruple gpu solutions because that that added latency like micro
[732.94 --> 737.64]  stuttery latency uh really hurt the gaming experience even if your system was actually
[737.64 --> 743.56]  you know feeding a lot of frames they weren't being delivered smoothly and it wasn't really a
[743.56 --> 753.04]  fantastic experience i will miss it as just like a fun you know ep narrator way to you know trick out
[753.04 --> 760.78]  your system i guess but i i can also see how now that nvidia is committed to this strategy it seems
[760.78 --> 770.78]  of building more and more massive gpus generation by generation um it almost feels unnecessary like
[770.78 --> 779.08]  now that nvidia has launched the rtx 3090 which has uh hold on a second rtx 3090 power consumption let me just
[779.08 --> 788.72]  see if anyone has sort of quoted that already um this the card is expected to utilize around 350 watts of
[788.72 --> 794.56]  power i mean not only did they just launch a 350 watt gpu they designed a new connector for it that's
[794.56 --> 799.60]  good for up to i think what 600 watts so if that's their commitment going forward is like we're going
[799.60 --> 806.70]  to completely reimagine you know thermal thermal controls for desktop gaming computers so we can
[806.70 --> 813.50]  start shipping like bigger more monstrous power hungry gpus from now on into the future i mean if nvidia
[813.50 --> 821.34]  just offers you a single card that's like yeah what you know sli would have been but we just we just
[821.34 --> 828.96]  baked it into a chip this big you can't really complain about that right and the whole yeah the
[828.96 --> 838.32]  whole many smaller gpus strategy has already been tried and it was a failure um amd went that route way
[838.32 --> 847.30]  back in the 3000 series days and i mean the old 3000 did they do a new 3000 hold on 480 trying to
[847.30 --> 855.74]  remember yeah 3000 so the radeon hd like 3870 was not competitive with nvidia's top end it was more
[855.74 --> 861.38]  competitive with nvidia's step down and then the way amd positioned it was oh well we'll just pack two of
[861.38 --> 866.58]  these onto a card to get competitive at the top end it didn't work it didn't work then it doesn't work
[866.58 --> 873.72]  now and until someone builds like a chiplet gpu i don't think we're going to see any kind of
[873.72 --> 882.78]  multi-die uh you know gaming graphics solution um i i will be very interested to see what if anything
[882.78 --> 887.20]  intel can pull out of their sleeves though because we've actually been hands-on with z graphics now
[887.20 --> 893.30]  i don't think our video is actually up yet but i'm fairly certain the embargo is lifted so i guess i can
[893.30 --> 905.26]  talk about it and so we we tested a laptop with on board intel z graphics and wow it's it's pretty
[905.26 --> 911.68]  impressive um let me just make sure the embargo is up on this yeah yesterday yesterday the embargo
[911.68 --> 918.76]  lifted so we had an intel 11th gen mobile chip absolutely thrashing an amd chip with radeon graphics
[918.76 --> 927.98]  in it now that wasn't featuring um rdna 2 obviously so amd definitely has they have a generation
[927.98 --> 935.06]  literally in the chamber to pull out and combat this with but we don't know how good rdna 2 is
[935.06 --> 941.32]  so and we don't know how well it'll scale down to something like a mobile cpu so for now intel has
[941.32 --> 948.56]  managed to take back the crown in at least in at least one way one one way definitely at least one
[948.56 --> 960.18]  way and you know what i say to that good for you hooray hooray indeed so scalpers ah fine i wanted to
[960.18 --> 965.76]  talk about sli some more i'm gonna miss it it was so cool no no i'm done i'm over it i'm over it just
[965.76 --> 974.04]  like nvidia is just like thanks for that uh consumers consumers troll rtx 3080 scalpers so
[974.04 --> 978.94]  let's talk about the situation here i mean luke and i saw this coming luke did we talk about this
[978.94 --> 984.66]  on wan show last week we did we did we did yep you know i actually i had a tweet from someone who was
[984.66 --> 990.30]  real mad at me they're real mad because um i think someone i think hardware connects posted
[990.30 --> 998.14]  on twitter that they are withholding any rtx 3080 content that they otherwise had planned to release
[998.14 --> 1005.06]  um out of oh man what did they say it was something to do with because people can't actually buy it
[1005.06 --> 1012.28]  they don't want to they don't want to make uh content that's like promoting it or something like
[1012.28 --> 1018.44]  that i'm gonna modify the schedule a bit posting build slash more rtx 3080 content right now just doesn't
[1018.44 --> 1023.38]  feel right promoting an item that's being scalped so heavily would just feed the situation even more
[1023.38 --> 1028.00]  it's our true hope that nvidia geforce put solutions in place for the next launches
[1028.00 --> 1037.30]  um so i get it yeah i get it um but also like the only reason this doesn't happen every generation is
[1037.30 --> 1044.02]  because some generations just aren't exciting every time a graphics card has launched that people
[1044.02 --> 1050.62]  actually want getting them has been like finding a hen's tooth in a haystack if you know what i mean
[1050.62 --> 1057.38]  like i worked on the procurement side for multiple generations of graphics card launches and the only
[1057.38 --> 1063.52]  ones that we could get adequate supply are were extraordinarily unexciting ones like gts 250 you know
[1063.52 --> 1068.90]  whether it was evga or zotac or gigabyte they'd be on the phone and be like hey you want a you want a
[1068.90 --> 1075.22]  big launch allocation of gts 250 and be like no what i want that for there's going to be plenty
[1075.22 --> 1079.02]  of them i'll just order them later when you guys have got them on rebate and we'll deal with that
[1079.02 --> 1084.84]  down the line when it came to flagship launches like i remember times when you know someone like
[1084.84 --> 1092.06]  an evga would ship us 11 units you know like they couldn't even do a nice round number and you know
[1092.06 --> 1097.44]  they would try to follow it up right like they'd get you another another six you know later on that week
[1097.44 --> 1103.18]  but the only way to get one was to was to backorder it and then just hope that you picked the right skew
[1103.18 --> 1109.90]  because the way that ncix worked with them uh you couldn't be like oh hey i'm at this point in the
[1109.90 --> 1117.80]  queue on like evga ko or whatever and then like kosc shipment comes in you you wouldn't like get an
[1117.80 --> 1122.78]  option to get one of those you would just be sitting there hooped because the you know the exact one
[1122.78 --> 1129.08]  of nvidia's or evga's two dozen skews for the same stupid gpu wouldn't come in and you just you're
[1129.08 --> 1135.90]  just totally hosed um but i remember this happening all the time and that that's one of the big like
[1135.90 --> 1141.90]  advantages that you would try to make for yourself as a retailer is you try to get in the good graces
[1141.90 --> 1149.00]  of the add-in board partners and nvidia themselves to make sure that you've got allocation because when
[1149.00 --> 1154.96]  you've got a hot new gpu it does more than just get you the you know five percent profit if you're
[1154.96 --> 1160.28]  lucky on that graphics card yes my friends it is pretty normal for a retailer to make between five
[1160.28 --> 1165.54]  to eight percent even on a thousand plus dollar graphics card but it's about more than that because
[1165.54 --> 1171.56]  someone buying that graphics card well you're by having it when nobody else has it you're creating a
[1171.56 --> 1176.20]  customer experience you're giving yourself an opportunity to build a relationship with that customer so
[1176.20 --> 1181.40]  maybe they'll come back and also there's the like system builder factor a lot of people don't upgrade
[1181.40 --> 1185.92]  their old system they just build a whole new system so when they see that new graphics card launch they
[1185.92 --> 1190.56]  go oh hey time to upgrade so by having the graphics card in stock you're not making a thousand dollar
[1190.56 --> 1195.36]  sale you're making a three thousand dollar sale as they build a whole new top of the line system
[1195.36 --> 1202.68]  so we would work really hard to try and get allocation of these cards meanwhile board partners are working
[1202.68 --> 1207.70]  real hard with nvidia to try and get allocation of the gpus and i assure you that nvidia is working
[1207.70 --> 1212.92]  real hard trying to produce as many of these gpus as they can you think nvidia wants to ship fewer
[1212.92 --> 1219.44]  graphics cards than they absolutely have to uh no has nvidia ever given you any indication that they
[1219.44 --> 1229.42]  don't like making money no definitely no it just is what it is unless you're apple and you literally run
[1229.42 --> 1238.62]  like multiple factories around the clock for two months leading up to a launch it is normal for a
[1238.62 --> 1245.14]  really hot item to be in short supply that's just the way it is so anyway i had someone real mad at me
[1245.14 --> 1252.26]  about the can it run crisis uh 3080 video that went up the day after the review in light of hardware
[1252.26 --> 1260.78]  canucks is much more moral stance on the situation and my take is like what you can't watch that video
[1260.78 --> 1270.08]  in two weeks or four weeks or six weeks from now and like enjoy it then when you can buy a graphics card
[1270.08 --> 1276.42]  or like i i don't know i just i just don't get it what difference does it make and like if you can't
[1276.42 --> 1282.86]  if you can't be disciplined enough to not spend you know fit a 1500 on a graphics card like twice
[1282.86 --> 1288.62]  what it's worth on ebay that's that's on you that's not on me like i i don't know what to tell you
[1288.62 --> 1298.06]  like i don't have a personal 3080 yet so it's okay we can wait a little bit i think i think something
[1298.06 --> 1305.38]  that i i saw which i don't know if i'm gonna be able to find it but i saw some memes about it
[1305.38 --> 1313.26]  was gamers gamer gamers nexus's stance on this stuff which is just like i think they said
[1313.26 --> 1319.86]  something along the lines of like it's not it's not food and water like you'll be fine yeah the
[1319.86 --> 1325.58]  irony is that as far as i can tell steve from gamers nexus plays fewer games than i do
[1325.58 --> 1333.98]  no i well okay if you're looking just at like the name of the channel sure but like the uh i think the
[1333.98 --> 1338.52]  the sentiment there is good like what you have right now is probably fine if it was fine a week
[1338.52 --> 1345.80]  ago yes it's it's fine now yes just relax it'll it'll come back in stock at some point you'll be
[1345.80 --> 1350.66]  able to get your card at some point and you'll be fine these are optional items these are optional
[1350.66 --> 1357.94]  not like the playstation 5 which as we all know is just as essential as shelter clean water you know
[1357.94 --> 1365.08]  access to access to medical care um let's just talk through what's going on with the 3080 for
[1365.08 --> 1371.16]  those who are not familiar so uh pretty much any listing that shows the card in stock is being
[1371.16 --> 1378.18]  instantaneously sold out and while bot protection is in place for most if not all of the online stores
[1378.18 --> 1383.86]  several scalpers have been shown to have bought dozens of cards within seconds of orders going live
[1383.86 --> 1390.14]  so that appears to be a big part of the problem so one of the most common bots seems to have been
[1390.14 --> 1395.24]  provided by bounce alerts who confirmed with pc magazine that they did indeed provide a bot to
[1395.24 --> 1400.94]  help members purchase the rtx 3080 units on launch day so they said the bot works as an automated script
[1400.94 --> 1405.22]  to run basically from the product page to payment information and checkout monitoring when the product
[1405.22 --> 1410.98]  gets back in stock and immediately checking out nvidia's website actually crashed during the early
[1410.98 --> 1414.84]  phase of the sale meaning the bots had to be restarted manually allowing at least some legitimate
[1414.84 --> 1420.86]  buyers to get their orders in now nvidia claims that they're doing everything humanly possible to
[1420.86 --> 1428.46]  review rtx 3080 orders to verify that they're human but like realistically there's only so much that i
[1428.46 --> 1436.72]  think they can do i mean all it takes is a slightly more sophisticated bot to uh you know try to act a
[1436.72 --> 1440.04]  little bit more human you know put a different name on it here and there that sort of thing
[1440.04 --> 1445.62]  um so many shoppers have been left out in the cold while ebay auctions have sprung up at astronomical
[1445.62 --> 1453.62]  prices now the community seems to not be taking this in stride because these graphics cards are in
[1453.62 --> 1461.44]  fact essential to their way of life and um someone has created a bot that has been automatically scraping
[1461.44 --> 1470.02]  ebay for rtx 3080 listings and placing ridiculous bids on the cards with no intention of paying them
[1470.04 --> 1480.20]  so that um basically the auction will run out and that scalper is just going to be stuck with a card
[1480.20 --> 1485.96]  and a buyer that has no intent to pay now to be clear we're not condoning any of this behavior i'm not
[1485.96 --> 1492.12]  condoning scalpers and i'm not condoning fraud because that's what it is um but we're just going to
[1492.12 --> 1497.06]  talk about it on the when show and we we've actually had some bad experience with this i don't know you you probably
[1497.06 --> 1505.70]  remember that stupid video with the the blue iphone thing i do i do actually and we got we got screwed
[1505.70 --> 1510.92]  on that and we were just trying to help we were literally trying to donate money yeah to testicular
[1510.92 --> 1519.86]  cancer research yep and we got screwed over the the someone did this to our ebay listing of that phone
[1519.86 --> 1525.32]  not just one because we made our way down the list and basically every one of the bidders had no intention
[1525.32 --> 1535.04]  of paying and it's just like okay yeah uh so i guess i don't remember how that got resolved i think we flipped
[1535.04 --> 1539.96]  it on craigslist and donated the money just quietly and decided not to do anything like that for a long
[1539.96 --> 1546.68]  time um yeah was pretty much it like way to go you ruined it for everyone uh yeah yeah so it's it's been
[1546.68 --> 1552.22]  used in whatever you want however you want to think about this the the way it's being used for 3080 it's been
[1552.22 --> 1559.10]  used in very not good ways as well yep um so other users are taking a different approach making
[1559.10 --> 1564.56]  misleading listings for rtx 3080 cards removing them from sale before the auction actually ends
[1564.56 --> 1571.70]  so there's a 3080 printed slash paper edition whatever whatever that is um
[1571.70 --> 1581.50]  there's one posted by gaben's son which is just like a drawing of it i actually i kind of am not a hundred
[1581.50 --> 1587.68]  percent sure how this is relevant but hey there it is uh for a hundred thousand dollars so i guess
[1587.68 --> 1594.36]  they're just trying to create so much disorder in the market that it's making it really difficult to
[1594.36 --> 1603.42]  actually flip them um some folks have taken to review bombing the rtx 3080 on ebay to um make other
[1603.42 --> 1614.30]  people think that it's a scam um yeah so it's pretty it's pretty interesting um it's uncertain
[1614.30 --> 1619.48]  whether nvidia expected this to happen but they claim that demand has been unprecedented and that
[1619.48 --> 1626.90]  may actually be the case because uh looking at uh hard further on into hardware canucks's uh tweet storm
[1626.90 --> 1632.98]  here not really storm let's call it a thread um they said that hold on where is it blah blah blah blah
[1632.98 --> 1637.36]  blah blah i don't know they had another tweet i saw it somewhere maybe it was a reply to someone
[1637.36 --> 1641.68]  but basically they called around some retailers and they said that allocation was actually better
[1641.68 --> 1649.00]  than some previous launches it's just a really really hot card i am not surprised at all like
[1649.00 --> 1654.74]  that's the thing that's the thing that's really funny to me i've seen this so many times you know so
[1654.74 --> 1661.96]  many times and i just don't get it you know whether it's a cpu manufacturer being like yeah you guys
[1661.96 --> 1665.88]  you guys better make sure you stock up on this thing it's going to be hot it's going to be hot
[1665.88 --> 1671.82]  and then i get it in my hands and i'm like i could have told you from 20 minutes with this thing
[1671.82 --> 1679.00]  like a quicks and a bench run and like two gaming benchmarks that it's not hot like what gave you the
[1679.00 --> 1685.42]  idea that it was hot what what is this based on or the other way around your trust when something is
[1685.42 --> 1690.34]  actually hot exactly and then you see it the other way around where you've got nvidia here that's
[1690.34 --> 1697.52]  like yeah this is the biggest intergenerational increase that we've made like in a decade or
[1697.52 --> 1703.56]  whatever however long it's been and even over hyping it themselves like is that it like did they
[1703.56 --> 1708.42]  did they make the up to two times performance claims during their keynote because of like insecurity
[1708.42 --> 1715.80]  like they're they're over hyping it they know that it's fast they must know it's fast they have all
[1715.80 --> 1721.54]  the same benchmarking tools and games that we do better ones even and then they're like oh we didn't
[1721.54 --> 1727.46]  we really didn't expect it to sell this well the craziest thing is they didn't have to launch it yet
[1727.46 --> 1734.74]  the next gen consoles aren't coming until what november when is the actual ship date for playstation 5
[1734.74 --> 1740.48]  manufacturing yeah they could have just november 12th but at the same time like that's not better for
[1740.48 --> 1747.36]  oh it totally is totally is a big red hot launch where everyone who wants one can get one is the
[1747.36 --> 1756.64]  best that's huge there's more people talking about it this way uh yes and no because remember when
[1756.64 --> 1761.86]  you're actually shipping product people are going to be posting on twitter hey here's my new card
[1761.86 --> 1768.50]  here's my benchmark scores so you get conversation either way no strong disagree strongly disagree i think
[1768.50 --> 1774.12]  real product in the hands of real users because remember like for all for every person who trusts
[1774.12 --> 1781.10]  me let's say to say rtx 3080 great card go buy it there's going to be 50 users that aren't going to do
[1781.10 --> 1786.62]  it until they hear it from their buddy and in a lot of cases their buddy might just watch my video and be
[1786.62 --> 1792.22]  like yeah i wasn't due for an upgrade but like linus says it's good go for it that can happen a lot
[1792.22 --> 1799.18]  but a lot of the time if you're that buddy you know everyone's buddy who's into tech you are buying
[1799.18 --> 1803.16]  it you're buying it and you're going to use it you're going to be like yeah y'all yeah i'm on this
[1803.16 --> 1808.42]  thing's dope it's dope and then they're going to run out and buy it so getting it in the hands of those
[1808.42 --> 1813.74]  of those those micro influencers is what i'd call them the people that are so passionate about these
[1813.74 --> 1819.88]  graphics cards they like your friend groups tech guy exactly exactly getting it in the in every one of
[1819.88 --> 1825.82]  those people's hands that should be your number one priority which is exactly why lttstore.com
[1825.82 --> 1833.56]  is doing a nice big run of this is the most exciting hold on hold on this is sweet okay this is the most
[1833.56 --> 1841.24]  exciting t-shirt launch that we have had oh man i don't know in quite some time so it's limited edition
[1841.24 --> 1848.56]  it uses this sweet foil that actually took a fair bit of work for our printer who's local
[1848.56 --> 1857.18]  um fair bit of work to get the hang of but this is i forget what it's called this is the keyboard
[1857.18 --> 1867.70]  shirt special edition my friends oh yeah so it's got like this sweet iridescent foil and so we're
[1867.70 --> 1875.76]  calling it uh the like rgb keyboard rgb keyboard because you got that uh that rgb effect on it uh it is
[1875.76 --> 1882.82]  more expensive than our usual shirts because the a the foil is more expensive than what we typically
[1882.82 --> 1890.46]  print with and b there are imperfect yields so we'll get bubbles or we'll get little gaps in the
[1890.46 --> 1895.62]  transfer um it's a combination of it just being trickier to work with and us not having as much
[1895.62 --> 1902.44]  experience with it um but some of our shirts are are they don't make the cut now just so you guys know
[1902.44 --> 1908.62]  don't worry none of those shirts are going to end up in a landfill uh they will all be donated or if
[1908.62 --> 1915.36]  what is going on here they'll all be donated or if we end up with so much of it that it's not really
[1915.36 --> 1922.14]  feasible to to donate it to a single place um then what we might do is like a misprint skew or something
[1922.14 --> 1926.90]  like that like hey do you not care if it's perfect well here you go it's definitely cheaper
[1926.90 --> 1932.56]  so we'll figure it out we're not going to waste if i can interject yeah yeah yeah go for it and it
[1932.56 --> 1938.10]  might it might be a long time to hold the inventory and that's its whole own thing so maybe this is
[1938.10 --> 1945.58]  terrible but i'm assuming we're doing or you're doing uh ltx 2021 you could do like we don't know
[1945.58 --> 1952.02]  we don't know yet yeah it's not really looking like it's going to get better i mean you're not
[1952.02 --> 1956.02]  even allowed to have big gatherings in canada so that was that's kind of a downer thing for you to
[1956.02 --> 1966.54]  bring up yeah okay well eventually yeah we'd love to do a signature thing you see mr b signed like
[1966.54 --> 1973.24]  150 000 shirts or something like that yeah i know right of course i even meant like just just like
[1973.24 --> 1979.60]  selling them or i don't know giving them away or something at ltx to get signatures from people that
[1979.60 --> 1984.14]  are at the event right you're right yeah yeah yeah just using them as a swag item sure because it's like
[1984.14 --> 1990.46]  uh there's some kind of novelty yeah to a failed print i'm not gonna hold on to them for 18 months
[1990.46 --> 1998.72]  though unfortunately oh that's where i'm at that definitely makes sense holding them until
[1998.72 --> 2008.66]  20 freaking 22 makes no sense yeah yeah so anyway uh back to ltxtstore.com yeah uh
[2008.66 --> 2013.48]  uh um there we go let's go ahead and click on this thing look at this guy look at look at this
[2013.48 --> 2018.98]  shirt is that sweet or what now there are a couple of important things to note guys if you are ordering
[2018.98 --> 2027.82]  this shirt wash the shirt inside out with the art facing in in cold water only and always hang to dry
[2027.82 --> 2034.64]  never tumble never heat dry there is nothing we're going to be able to do for you warranty wise if you
[2034.64 --> 2040.62]  destroy the shirt by putting it in the dryer it will fade slash be destroyed extremely quickly
[2040.62 --> 2047.56]  so if you don't have the discipline to cold wash it then don't buy it there are lots of other shirts
[2047.56 --> 2052.96]  for you yeah there's lots of other shirts literally everything else on ltxtstore.com is designed to be
[2052.96 --> 2058.12]  crumpled up into a ball chucked in your hamper thrown in the washing machine at whatever temperature
[2058.12 --> 2064.82]  tickles your fancy and then thrown in the tumble dryer everything else no problem not this one
[2064.82 --> 2071.70]  please be more careful with it so uh guys that is going to be a limited edition print i believe we
[2071.70 --> 2079.84]  are planning to do 300 of them um by the way oh i have an update on the cpu pins shirt so we had
[2079.84 --> 2086.56]  three that were printed with an alternate design and two of the prizes have been claimed so we are we
[2086.56 --> 2092.40]  arranging corsair vengeance gaming pcs for those folks and we are waiting to hear back from one more
[2092.40 --> 2100.96]  of our winners so that's a totally totally unrelated um that's a totally unrelated thing
[2100.96 --> 2109.02]  how we did shirts before with a previous design that were a little bit different and they got a cool prize
[2109.02 --> 2115.80]  by the way we're launching the keyboard shirt go check it out
[2115.80 --> 2121.66]  i can't promise we would ever do anything like that again
[2121.66 --> 2124.54]  thanks
[2124.54 --> 2138.62]  all right let's uh move on to uh let's move on to oh you know what we should get through let's yeah let's
[2138.62 --> 2142.62]  get through our sponsors here and then we'll talk about playstation 5 pricing

[2196.74 --> 2204.38]  msi msi hey it's the msi mag b50 b550 tomahawk motherboard so the new tomahawk is significantly
[2204.38 --> 2210.34]  better built than the old tomahawk it is more expensive but the b550 tomahawk is a pretty freaking
[2210.34 --> 2218.58]  sweet motherboard it's got everything you need as a gamer and i mean really i said this during my b550
[2218.58 --> 2224.90]  like motherboard unboxing on short circuit but i was like as a gamer is there any reason to buy x570
[2224.90 --> 2236.54]  i really don't know it supports high speed ddr4 memory uh m.2 uh m.2 uh m.2 holy crap uh we sold
[2236.54 --> 2249.56]  through half our shirts already uh yeah go with your sister um oh crap hold on i might have to do some
[2249.56 --> 2255.70]  business things uh oh crap we might have to oh no we might have to actually print more but we have
[2255.70 --> 2261.60]  we had a plan to like hand qc all of them and the person who's going to do that i don't know if they're
[2261.60 --> 2267.66]  going to have time to do more i got to send a quick message to nick uh are we going to have time to qc
[2267.66 --> 2276.04]  more can we print more uh okay uh hold on a second so msi the msi meg b550 tomahawk
[2276.04 --> 2285.54]  it's got pcie gen 4 m.2 and a 16x slot for your new rtx 3000 graphics onboard two and a half gig lan
[2285.54 --> 2291.20]  which is really a great compromise between cost and performance uh between gigabit and 10 gig and
[2291.20 --> 2297.50]  premium thermal solution check it out the link in the video description wow um that's crazy we need
[2297.50 --> 2302.08]  to i don't know you know what it doesn't matter let's just uh i'll let i'll keep you guys updated
[2302.08 --> 2310.50]  i'm sure nick's going to be replying to me um uh okay apple's fall event hey did you see anything
[2310.50 --> 2317.06]  exciting at the apple fall event luke no well there's a new ipad there's a new ipad air that
[2317.06 --> 2324.80]  as far as i can tell makes the ipad pro basically irrelevant because it's got the a14 chipset it's five
[2324.80 --> 2331.70]  nanometer so it's high performance it's got a retina display up to 500 nits so you should get
[2331.70 --> 2338.38]  actually a pretty compelling hdr experience from it uh usb type c sweet same camera as the ipad pro
[2338.38 --> 2344.46]  stereo speakers and landscape hey look usb c is a good feature just because apple's a little late to
[2344.46 --> 2349.56]  the party doesn't mean that we shouldn't applaud them for it wi-fi 6 apple pencil support and it's
[2349.56 --> 2357.46]  599 for the 64 gig model that's right my friends uh uh a tablet in the year 2020 that still has only
[2357.46 --> 2364.58]  64 gigs of storage thank you apple 600 to apple's credit can i take a moment to appreciate something
[2364.58 --> 2374.12]  about apple here sure this is a mid-tier device okay that ships with a flagship processor meanwhile
[2374.12 --> 2380.10]  in android land everyone's trying to talk consumers into mid-tier processors
[2380.10 --> 2388.28]  yeah off you go i told him to share with you meanwhile in android land you've got like
[2388.28 --> 2394.66]  manufacturers trying to pitch mid-tier processors in premium devices and then apple's all like yeah
[2394.66 --> 2398.58]  look it doesn't have a ton of storage but realistically what do you need a bunch of storage in an ipad for
[2398.58 --> 2402.64]  like and that's a fair point because you shouldn't be taking pictures and videos on your ipad
[2402.64 --> 2410.38]  unless you're a jackass so hey you've got performance that is going to be good enough
[2410.38 --> 2414.96]  for probably the act like the five years that apple is likely to support this bloody device
[2414.96 --> 2420.04]  there is something to be said for that approach is apple making great margin on these devices
[2420.04 --> 2429.18]  absolutely absolutely but what what do you think what do you think so almost no one even makes
[2429.18 --> 2434.86]  really tablets anymore and almost no one is really focusing on tablets anymore what do you think
[2434.86 --> 2441.18]  uh like how i guess what is not the right way to start that question how do you think tablets fit in
[2441.18 --> 2449.06]  with a market that in a lot of ways at least is showing interest in pushing quite heavily into not
[2449.06 --> 2453.94]  just massive phones but massive phones that have multiple screens um
[2453.94 --> 2461.50]  you know what i'm gonna flip it around you tell me first
[2461.50 --> 2470.26]  i i don't really think it has ton that has a ton sorry the the industry itself seems much less
[2470.26 --> 2475.38]  interested in tablets in general ipads being the only ones that anyone seems to care about at all
[2475.38 --> 2482.24]  um and maybe they'll have that okay actually maybe it is a pretty big deal because if you're so into
[2482.24 --> 2486.82]  the apple space that you're buying an ipad you probably you're you have you don't have a multi-screen
[2486.82 --> 2495.86]  phone anyways yeah yep yeah it's actually a completely irrelevant conversation but that said i don't think
[2495.86 --> 2501.30]  you have to be completely into the apple ecosystem at all to have an ipad if i cared about have a tablet
[2501.30 --> 2507.30]  you probably have an ipad yeah if i cared about having an a tablet at all i would have an ipad 100
[2507.30 --> 2515.46]  percent like there's there's no way like i want to straw poll the audience here sure because i mean
[2515.46 --> 2521.54]  even what was samsung's latest galaxy galaxy tab sick something something whatever whatever it is
[2521.54 --> 2527.62]  looks great but the problem with android tablets isn't the hardware there's great hardware out there i
[2527.62 --> 2532.38]  mean samsung's been making beautiful android tablets for years and years and years the problem
[2532.38 --> 2538.62]  is the software they don't get a ton of updates on the os side and the apps because google doesn't
[2538.62 --> 2545.06]  push hard enough for app developers to make proper tablet versions of their apps they just aren't very
[2545.06 --> 2551.56]  good they don't make proper use of all the extra space at best and in some cases all they do is just
[2551.56 --> 2559.88]  like stretch it like it's not it's just not a better experience whereas on an ipad i mean i haven't owned
[2559.88 --> 2566.68]  one for daily driver use in a while but i do always remember just the the app experience being thoughtful
[2566.68 --> 2575.34]  it's really designed to be used on ipad one thing i do wonder is as we see bigger and bigger android phones
[2575.34 --> 2581.54]  particularly with foldable devices is if that situation will change i mean the galaxy fold z2 is
[2581.54 --> 2588.16]  equivalent almost to what like a seven inch tablet you are getting dangerously close to yeah your app is
[2588.16 --> 2593.26]  really not going to display properly on this thing if you don't make some changes to it and those changes
[2593.26 --> 2599.88]  would likely translate very well to a tablet the problem is that from my experience the galaxy fold z2
[2599.88 --> 2604.44]  has not been particular or the fold series has not been particularly well supported even youtube
[2604.44 --> 2610.76]  still as of a few weeks ago anyway didn't have support for stories on it which is the reason i can't daily
[2610.76 --> 2615.58]  drive it because i need to both check our stories and i need to be able to upload new ones and i don't
[2615.58 --> 2620.76]  feel like carrying around a secondary phone for that i'm not sure if that's been fixed on the fold z2
[2620.76 --> 2627.78]  because samsung still hasn't gotten me one um but i guess i'll figure it out eventually yay
[2627.78 --> 2633.48]  in uh do you have your straw poll ready do you want me to move on to the next thing while you do that
[2633.48 --> 2641.10]  it's been posted already we already have some votes um right now i i the question was are you a tablet
[2641.10 --> 2647.30]  customer then there's three responses one was yes i will buy one in the next two years one was yes i
[2647.30 --> 2653.18]  own one that i bought in the last two years and then the last answer was no and it seems like the
[2653.18 --> 2660.34]  majority of the audience said no but not by a massive amount it's like 49 percent of people
[2660.34 --> 2668.74]  said one of the yeses for being a tablet customer yeah here can i get the link to that so i can show
[2668.74 --> 2672.30]  it on stream uh yes give me one moment sweet
[2672.30 --> 2682.90]  like are you a tablet customer me no definitely i've literally never bought a tablet why not
[2682.90 --> 2691.22]  why would i i don't know it's like because your eyesight sucks and your phone is small
[2691.22 --> 2700.18]  in in my i would always be happy to lug something bigger around in order to have a keyboard
[2700.18 --> 2705.32]  i see yeah but it's a tablet the keyboard even though it's bigger is actually worse
[2705.32 --> 2711.32]  i type like an order well not an order of magnitude but like twice as fast twice as fast on a phone as i
[2711.32 --> 2716.74]  do on a tablet for sure especially with like a well-trained auto correct that's why i don't
[2716.74 --> 2721.54]  want a tablet yeah that's fair that's fair i get it because like and i agree with that exact statement
[2721.54 --> 2726.88]  if i'm if i'm just firing off quick and messy messages yeah i'd rather do it on a phone because
[2726.88 --> 2732.28]  i'm gonna go really quick and like people are probably gonna be able to understand my my typos
[2732.28 --> 2736.48]  and my weird auto corrects and whatever it doesn't matter uh and i can just fire through stuff
[2736.48 --> 2742.68]  really quick if i'm trying to do like messaging style productivity when i'm not at my desktop
[2742.68 --> 2748.84]  or my laptop isn't fully set up my phone is always going to be way better so what am i going to do on
[2748.84 --> 2755.16]  a tablet for me it would be like watch something netflix yeah and then the priority level of that is
[2755.16 --> 2762.20]  like really low yeah who cares like i can do that on whatever like i'll i'll find a way maybe i can
[2762.20 --> 2768.78]  find a bigger screen or i can't and it's still on my phone cool i who cares like it's hey i'm not
[2768.78 --> 2774.92]  gonna buy a expensive device for that i've been meaning to ask you you own a tv now for the first
[2774.92 --> 2782.56]  time in like years has that changed your habits at all do you actually watch tv like on the tv
[2782.56 --> 2790.56]  no i kind of didn't think it would so you blew like two grand on a tv you don't watch
[2790.56 --> 2796.68]  emma loves it okay happy wife happy life
[2796.68 --> 2805.16]  there are some investment one makes not for themselves all right uh in other news uh apple
[2805.16 --> 2810.46]  launched honestly i think the watches were far more exciting so the new watch series six measures
[2810.46 --> 2816.16]  blood oxygen in 15 seconds and can track oxygen saturation during sleep which is totally useless
[2816.16 --> 2820.34]  because there's no way of charging it while you sleep so that's really stupid um you know maybe
[2820.34 --> 2825.56]  someday there'll be a wearable that has like sleep monitoring features that doesn't need to be charged
[2825.56 --> 2831.10]  at night but until that time i guess i will completely ignore these kinds of innovations it has a better
[2831.10 --> 2834.98]  always on display that's more efficient and two and a half times brighter than the previous generation
[2834.98 --> 2841.28]  the altimeter is always on oh i always want to know how high i am there's emoji faces defense of
[2841.28 --> 2846.08]  the blood oxygen while you sleep thing yes if you're someone who actually kind of needs that
[2846.08 --> 2849.52]  then you could charge during the day or get two just buy two
[2849.52 --> 2859.62]  why not okay now that is an innovation apple free of charge okay you guys come up with the apple watch
[2859.62 --> 2865.90]  series six squared it's just a two pack you wear one at night one in the morning and they just sync to
[2865.90 --> 2871.82]  each other so that it's like a perfectly seamless experience i could totally see people doing it so
[2871.82 --> 2878.14]  you never have to take off your apple watch the night one could even be like styled a little
[2878.14 --> 2884.80]  different yeah like it could not even have a display so it's like it's like a companion oh they
[2884.80 --> 2891.50]  should totally do it they should actually do it and softer materials yeah it's not like gonna
[2891.50 --> 2898.18]  oh do anything bad i know no one from apple watches this show but guys you've gotta do it
[2898.18 --> 2905.96]  the like apple watch pm something like that like the one that's like that's great oh man that's a
[2905.96 --> 2911.32]  fantastic name i mean i don't think they take you know ideas from outside of the company because they
[2911.32 --> 2915.38]  must not be good ideas because if you had good ideas surely you would already work at apple but
[2915.38 --> 2921.42]  like it's a really good idea like with my wireless charger on my nightstand that would talk because the
[2921.42 --> 2927.78]  problem with with health devices is that they don't work unless they're really part of your routine
[2927.78 --> 2934.08]  they don't work if you use them sometimes so i could totally make that part even being a totally
[2934.08 --> 2939.72]  absent-minded magoo that i am i could totally make that part of my routine i get up in the morning
[2939.72 --> 2945.44]  i switch my watch out and you know what the pm one could even have like pretty decent battery life
[2945.44 --> 2950.24]  like the daytime one so if i like forgot for a few hours and switched it at that time it wouldn't miss
[2950.24 --> 2955.48]  a beat get it get it miss a beat because heart rate monitoring anyway the point is so i get up in the
[2955.48 --> 2962.62]  morning feeling like p diddy got my it doesn't matter uh i get up in the morning i switch my watch i go to
[2962.62 --> 2968.30]  bed i switch my watch it's genius anyway there's a new loop it's flexible silicone 20 faster charging
[2968.30 --> 2976.46]  five gigahertz wi-fi finally uh u1 chip for spatial awareness and it's 400 bucks for the gps model it's
[2976.46 --> 2981.56]  pretty reasonable i guess we've come a long way from the addition you know thousand plus dollar
[2981.56 --> 2987.94]  however much they charge for that thing and then there's the watch se which is under 300 has the
[2987.94 --> 2993.84]  series 5 soc so the s5 does not have the blood oxygen sensor but otherwise has the same screen and
[2993.84 --> 2998.02]  sensors it's the series 6 and there's no power adapter in the box which for me wouldn't matter
[2998.02 --> 3003.82]  because i actually have a combo charger that i really like so it's wireless for phone airpods
[3003.82 --> 3008.32]  pros and apple watches it's ironic out of my three mobile devices that i carry every day
[3008.32 --> 3012.56]  two of them are apple even though i do not use an iphone
[3012.56 --> 3020.96]  oh and now apple's bundling their subscription services whatever all right let's talk about the
[3020.96 --> 3028.98]  other the other big one from this week nvidia poised to purchase arm for 40 billion dollars
[3028.98 --> 3035.44]  that's doing with a b price is also pretty big all right let's do that first so who do you think won
[3035.44 --> 3042.84]  who do you think won the price battle here xbox why the the subscription thing is just insane
[3042.84 --> 3051.20]  and like the the the the width disc drive price is the same as the series x so like okay ps5 without
[3051.20 --> 3059.38]  the disc drive you you get the the full fat except the disc drive for 399 which is pretty fantastic
[3059.38 --> 3062.06]  100 cheaper than either flagship console
[3062.06 --> 3073.24]  i strongly disagree you think you think ps5 wins i think ps5 won i think the all digital ps5
[3073.24 --> 3078.50]  so here's the thing because remember it's not like sony doesn't have a game subscription service to
[3078.50 --> 3086.18]  microsoft's pricing outstanding but they don't have exclusive games even temporarily exclusive
[3086.18 --> 3091.14]  they don't have exclusive games that would entice me to go buy it you just said the price war
[3091.14 --> 3096.98]  i did well you're the one who brought up the subscriptions i didn't bring up the subscriptions
[3096.98 --> 3102.88]  from a hardware standpoint i think it is indisputable that sony what you're making that face
[3102.88 --> 3109.64]  i don't like that face that's a rude face and i won't see it i won't have it i won't have it i won't
[3109.64 --> 3113.40]  have it i'm getting rid of you i'm getting rid of you hold on where's your no you're gone you're done
[3113.40 --> 3118.62]  you're out get one of the consoles no you're done subscription no you keep putting you keep
[3118.62 --> 3123.90]  pushing you keep pushing i'm gonna mute you too who's got the obs now
[3123.90 --> 3133.10]  all right you're back you're back you're back live subscription what is that okay uh hold on hold
[3133.10 --> 3136.34]  on a second hold on a second i'm trying to remember okay okay okay if you want to play an
[3136.34 --> 3143.10]  online game you have to have uh what's it called on playstation yeah so pia playstation plus
[3143.10 --> 3147.70]  collection was announced so ps5 owners with ps5 plus will be able to download and play a curated
[3147.70 --> 3152.42]  library of ps4 games that defined the generation like batman arkham knight bloodborne fallout 4 god
[3152.42 --> 3160.10]  of war monster hunter world persona 5 and many more so they've got great content out of the gate
[3160.10 --> 3165.70]  whereas microsoft as you pointed out is essentially giving away a free console with your subscription to
[3165.70 --> 3174.10]  the maybe a slightly more mediocre content but where i think sony got it right is actually
[3174.10 --> 3180.06]  very closely in line with what i said was so great about apple's approach with the new ipad air
[3180.06 --> 3188.02]  what you're getting with the playstation 5 digital edition so the one that does not have the disc drive
[3188.02 --> 3196.52]  is for 400 for less than the price of a series x or a full fat ps5 you are getting next generation
[3196.52 --> 3202.62]  performance in terms of the actual performance bang for the buck if we're to take microsoft's word for
[3202.62 --> 3209.56]  the teraflops of the series s versus the series x you are getting the best bang for the buck out of the
[3209.56 --> 3214.90]  next generation consoles bar none making it the most future-proof purchase out of the lot of them
[3214.90 --> 3224.38]  that is my argument so i think one thing here is is are you going only single player game because now
[3224.38 --> 3228.82]  now we're including the games well if you played competitive games and you actually cared about
[3228.82 --> 3235.68]  performing well you'd have a pc with a 120 hertz display no no okay okay okay okay okay okay and i was
[3235.68 --> 3246.80]  just being rude um so for me i would say that i would be more likely to sit in my couch and play a
[3246.80 --> 3252.50]  single player game with a controller i would be less likely to play anything competitive i know so like
[3252.50 --> 3262.40]  the the reason why i think xbox one is specifically not for you because i get like when i'm looking at
[3262.40 --> 3268.72]  this and i'm and i'm thinking xbox one i'm thinking uh households where the the kids are trying to
[3268.72 --> 3274.24]  convince the parents or or the or one of the parents is trying to convince the other parent like you're
[3274.24 --> 3279.36]  you're trying to pitch it to someone if you go like oh it's it's 30 bucks a month that's quite
[3279.36 --> 3287.70]  digestible versus 400 for a long time there the like oh a a household or individual with no kids can
[3287.70 --> 3293.74]  save up roughly this much money on splurge purchases thing that was roughed in at 300 bucks 299
[3293.74 --> 3298.80]  yeah for a long time that was a big discussion we had around i believe the last console console launch
[3298.80 --> 3304.22]  you're right they've cranked that up by a hundred dollars the average income of most people has not
[3304.22 --> 3314.70]  increased like at all yeah so like it is less digestible at 399 than they were when they were at 299
[3314.70 --> 3322.82]  it just is even if the 399 price is very competitive against what xbox has yeah as their hard prices i
[3322.82 --> 3328.36]  don't think what xbox is really pushing forward is their hard prices and if you're buying one of these
[3328.36 --> 3336.90]  i think in most cases it is probably your singular gaming machine i i'm assuming i actually i don't know
[3336.90 --> 3344.62]  this but like like when i was growing up we usually either had like really nicely specced computers
[3344.62 --> 3349.24]  and we were kind of a little out of date on the console side of things or we were up to date on
[3349.24 --> 3352.46]  the console side of things and we were a little out of date on the computer side of things most
[3352.46 --> 3359.90]  families cannot yeah most families cannot afford to like have the whole stable of you know current
[3359.90 --> 3367.06]  gen consoles and a nice gaming pc that's not reasonable and like my my dad was was pretty good
[3367.06 --> 3374.58]  at uh at like that's not the right phrasing my dad pushed forward consoles a fair amount um which makes
[3374.58 --> 3380.40]  sense family setting we all sit on the couch we play games together it was really cool um and then a lot
[3380.40 --> 3388.50]  of like my personal money went into my computer so but we i like that was very a big focus for me etc
[3388.50 --> 3393.32]  i think most households are going to have kind of one and if you're buying like a brand new console
[3393.32 --> 3398.02]  it's probably going to be one so it's 400 bucks which is really hard to digest and if that's your
[3398.02 --> 3403.36]  singular thing and you want to play games online with your friends you are getting what's looking like
[3403.36 --> 3409.04]  12 bucks a month subscription for ps plus and i don't think that comes with games because i think
[3409.04 --> 3415.82]  you need playstation now for games i don't know i'm not i don't know playstation add-ons well ps plus
[3415.82 --> 3424.70]  comes with some ps4 games okay um sure and then playstation now comes with more stuff i don't
[3424.70 --> 3428.68]  really know how the playstation stuff works but you're spending at least 12 bucks additional so
[3428.68 --> 3434.88]  playstation now is cloud gaming if you okay okay yeah so if you if you subscribe for longer periods
[3434.88 --> 3439.24]  of time if you subscribe for three months at a time it's 30 bucks six months at a time it's 70 bucks
[3439.24 --> 3445.48]  um so you get some some discounts there but not not massive ones just fairly reasonable discounts for
[3445.48 --> 3452.08]  subscribing in bigger amounts of time so probably let's say about 12 bucks a month so all right okay
[3452.08 --> 3459.12]  in 10 months in 10 months the xbox costs less all right i think it's fair to say that there's a console
[3459.12 --> 3465.04]  for everyone because if i'm more of like a single player experience person i might actually care more
[3465.04 --> 3473.86]  about playstation plus than i do about microsoft service and i think that the playstation 5 disc list
[3473.86 --> 3479.54]  like the digital edition makes a ton of sense for me because i'm sitting there i'm playing more like
[3479.54 --> 3485.74]  sightseeing type games beautiful games that are meant to be enjoyed on the latest hardware uh sony was
[3485.74 --> 3492.30]  very clear that they investigated they explored the idea of a lower spec ps5 and rejected it because
[3492.30 --> 3499.16]  they didn't like what it would mean for the game development process um and i think they were right
[3499.16 --> 3504.50]  yeah i think they were right about that but then i think microsoft is coming at it from a completely
[3504.50 --> 3510.12]  different point of view where like you said it's like this is the family it's the xbox it's the box
[3510.12 --> 3515.64]  it's that box that's for gaming or whatever so you got your subscription fee it's practically free
[3515.64 --> 3520.92]  uh the controllers are cheap because you could go pick up like secondhand xbox one controllers at
[3520.92 --> 3526.26]  game stop when they go out of business down the street um so it's meant to be this like affordable
[3526.26 --> 3533.04]  affordable affordable box um that's maybe more i don't want to say casual because that has such a
[3533.04 --> 3539.14]  negative connotation but it's certainly a less uh a less fraught purchase like you don't have to think
[3539.14 --> 3548.44]  about it quite so hard be more common to find the new xboxes in cheaper overall setups yes that makes
[3548.44 --> 3555.96]  um so like i yeah i don't i don't think the ps5 is positioned necessarily poorly i think what you
[3555.96 --> 3560.72]  brought up like like the the possibility of someone getting the console and not getting playstation now
[3560.72 --> 3566.80]  actually seems decently high yeah it seems pretty high like if i had 400 bucks to spend
[3566.80 --> 3572.70]  or 500 let's say because i might want to buy a game or something maybe uh so i get a playstation 5
[3572.70 --> 3578.62]  i get one controller that comes with it because i'm not going to buy another fancy 70 controller or
[3578.62 --> 3586.06]  whatever and i get and one game that i like really want to play i i buy oh man what are the launch
[3586.06 --> 3593.16]  titles again there's really not much even on the playstation side who uh oh man is hogwarts legacy
[3593.16 --> 3599.14]  even launching with the game or with the with the console i don't know i don't know demon souls
[3599.14 --> 3604.06]  maybe in the dock they they have some goods playstation has been fantastic on the single
[3604.06 --> 3608.90]  player game set of things so i legitimately see the use case of buying the digital ones you save 100
[3608.90 --> 3615.22]  bucks yeah some single player games over the life cycle of the console yeah enjoying it a lot and just
[3615.22 --> 3619.28]  seeing it off with that not really worrying about playstation now not really really worrying about
[3619.28 --> 3624.68]  playstation plus if you're on the xbox side of things i really see getting the subscription model
[3624.68 --> 3630.88]  console yeah getting in on those multiplayer games with your friends microsoft don't have as many
[3630.88 --> 3637.30]  exclusives and stuff microsoft is going hard on the whole just like commoditizing it turning it into a
[3637.30 --> 3643.06]  box and i think that that might cause some friction with game developers i've already seen some backlash
[3643.06 --> 3646.84]  about the fact that they have two different specs so now game developers have to target
[3646.84 --> 3653.76]  playstation xbox the high-end one xbox the low-end one probably for the time being they've got to hit
[3653.76 --> 3659.32]  playstation and xbox last gen both high-end and low-end all of a sudden they're basically developed
[3659.32 --> 3667.84]  i mean when you think about how few graphics cards there are that make up like the um kind of like
[3667.84 --> 3672.62]  let's say the lion's share of the steam hardware survey right because going back to anything older
[3672.62 --> 3678.98]  than like five years ago there's not much amd has what like 20 market share if that and that's among
[3678.98 --> 3686.08]  like sort of architecturally like two or three cards so nvidia basically has like their handful
[3686.08 --> 3690.92]  of gpus for each generation like we're at the point now we're supporting a console you're actually
[3690.92 --> 3696.90]  targeting maybe i'd say a third as many performance tiers as you are on the pc remember that assumes
[3696.90 --> 3702.62]  you're only looking at graphics and things like system memory and cpu speed and number of cores can also
[3702.62 --> 3707.86]  vary wildly on the pc but there are trends that you can find so it's like i can see how developers
[3707.86 --> 3712.08]  are getting a little frustrated with that but i think microsoft's going to continue to double down
[3712.08 --> 3718.26]  on it i think that we could start to see more frequent xbox refreshes i think that's why it's
[3718.26 --> 3727.18]  called series not because it's just series you know x and s i think it's series because just like they
[3727.18 --> 3734.40]  turned windows 10 into operating system as a service i think they're turning xbox into xbox as a service
[3734.40 --> 3741.80]  so we could just see yeah series x2 next year two years from now you know whenever amd pulls their
[3741.80 --> 3745.84]  head out of their butt and makes a new graphics card worth upgrading to boom two years from now
[3745.84 --> 3753.00]  exactly every two years that would be a full subscription of a console every time yep that
[3753.00 --> 3757.84]  could very well be the model looking at how microsoft has priced it so that you buy the console
[3757.84 --> 3765.84]  in two years so that way even though they don't have to what they could do is put a ton of pressure
[3765.84 --> 3773.30]  on sony because sony's business model is not designed to compete with that so all of a sudden microsoft
[3773.30 --> 3780.18]  would be leapfrogging them multiple times a generation in console performance potentially without
[3780.18 --> 3786.44]  necessarily changing much on the game developer side of things because everything's focused on like
[3786.44 --> 3792.34]  direct x right so it's just a matter of like here's more performance i mean you were going to
[3792.34 --> 3798.30]  develop for pc because it's cross-platform anyway so here's a faster pc it's a new box don't worry too
[3798.30 --> 3805.08]  much about what's inside it this is like this is the 4k box this is the 4k 60 fps box this is the 8k box
[3805.08 --> 3811.74]  as time goes on and it's it's basically just like your your settings in game are just pre-selected for
[3811.74 --> 3818.30]  you because it can detect what console you're on it's basically geforce experience yeah right it just
[3818.30 --> 3823.56]  detects what you're running on and is like yeah that seems about right so now now that you see the ps5
[3823.56 --> 3833.36]  pricing 499 399 yeah no weird subscription thing like xbox did what do you think about the positioning of
[3833.36 --> 3842.48]  xbox in terms of pricing because they have that 299 thing i think that i mentioned i think it's a
[3842.48 --> 3851.98]  great time to be a gamer straight up i think between the rtx 3000 series outstanding outstanding for pc
[3851.98 --> 3857.98]  gamers i'm not just people who have 700 to spend on a graphics card not at all not in the slightest
[3857.98 --> 3864.76]  because it's going to absolutely tank the prices of pascal and turing graphics cards never mind
[3864.76 --> 3872.36]  maxwell and you can still do a lot of gaming on a 980 or a 980 ti do not kid yourself and it is going
[3872.36 --> 3877.68]  to utterly destroy the secondhand pricing of those cards for people who don't have a ton of money
[3877.68 --> 3883.32]  not to mention prompt a lot of people to upgrade to the new ones and flood the market with those parts
[3883.32 --> 3890.94]  great time to be a gamer um playstation 5 honestly looks great xbox series x and series s
[3890.94 --> 3896.68]  honestly they look great just totally huge innovations in the game development side of things
[3896.68 --> 3902.76]  uh so we're going to see better game design thanks to these faster ssds we're going to see um what was
[3902.76 --> 3906.54]  i going to say right we're going to see more affordability for gamers than ever before with the
[3906.54 --> 3911.40]  subscription model from microsoft like there has it's never been a better time to be a gamer that's
[3911.40 --> 3921.06]  that's what i'll say today meanwhile nintendo's like hey guys we have ar we have augmented reality
[3921.06 --> 3927.22]  mario kart hello they made some statement that they're like working on a new console
[3927.22 --> 3932.92]  duh or like they confirmed like yes we are in fact doing anything
[3932.92 --> 3941.22]  i mean you can take that for granted my understanding of the game console development cycle is that
[3941.22 --> 3947.48]  you're basically working on the next console as soon as you have two seconds to catch your breath
[3947.48 --> 3954.18]  from launching the last one like like like 20 of the team stays on to to keep writing like you know
[3954.18 --> 3959.50]  firmware updates and stuff for the existing ones and the rest is like okay let's build it from scratch
[3959.50 --> 3965.26]  again yeah maybe more than 20 but you i think you guys get my point new console development
[3965.26 --> 3974.62]  never ends if you want to have any hope of staying competitive i i think i think the ps5 is
[3974.62 --> 3982.04]  in my opinion targeted as like the the almost the the like the like wealthy person i think it's more
[3982.04 --> 3988.20]  premium 100 yep and i think xbox is like the pleb console for sure in terms of the way that
[3988.20 --> 3995.10]  sony and microsoft see it not me not me you're hitting the the one-time payment digestible 299
[3995.10 --> 4000.72]  which due to wages not really increasing is the same digestible amount it was last time and they
[4000.72 --> 4004.94]  hit it again that's probably why the reason why they wanted a spec down console and even though
[4004.94 --> 4009.22]  there was pushback they did it anyways yeah folks they wanted to hit that 299 they want that commodity
[4009.22 --> 4015.62]  they want that commodity pricing they have the more premium one as well just because they got to hit
[4015.62 --> 4020.08]  those they got to be able to promote those performance numbers need those headlines i just won't make it
[4020.08 --> 4024.60]  so just make it and then they have their two subscription things which are super digestible
[4024.60 --> 4030.48]  even the high-end 49 console on subscription is much more digestible and then ps5 is just sitting
[4030.48 --> 4036.64]  over there like no screw subscriptions and you're paying a minimum of 400 bucks games cost a lot to make
[4036.64 --> 4043.94]  go buy them can i can i can i say something controversial right now we are way over time on the show today we
[4043.94 --> 4048.46]  haven't even gone through super chats but i i gotta i gotta hit you with this okay i'm gonna i want to say
[4048.46 --> 4054.96]  something controversial right now do it i'm ready nintendo switch pro assuming that they're actually
[4054.96 --> 4061.14]  working on such a thing could be the most compelling of all of them of course here's why here's why
[4061.14 --> 4069.96]  not to you i guess fanboy no no no no no no hold on hold on but for a reason you're not expecting
[4069.96 --> 4075.88]  for a reason you're not expecting though okay for a reason you're not expecting because in addition to
[4075.88 --> 4083.14]  having a more powerful soc i think that it is basically a guarantee that it will include the
[4083.14 --> 4088.50]  crazy up sampling technology that nvidia has been working on over the last few years
[4088.50 --> 4096.56]  so nintendo could conceivably ship like a portable console that like games at 4k
[4096.56 --> 4106.28]  because it could render at like 1080p seamlessly up sample to 4k and absolutely blow the console
[4106.28 --> 4113.50]  gaming world's mind because amd's technology when it comes to upscaling is so far behind nvidia's that
[4113.50 --> 4119.52]  it's not even they're not even competing on the same planet at this point like have you seen what
[4119.52 --> 4128.56]  the shield pro can do would you want it 4k in your hand i think i wouldn't yeah it wouldn't have to
[4128.56 --> 4133.34]  be i wouldn't care about that but they actually build some real tech into their dock this time
[4133.34 --> 4138.64]  and do an upscaler in the dock no because they don't have to the upscaler would definitely be in
[4138.64 --> 4146.00]  the soc like there's no way it wouldn't be and the thing too is that the switch could benefit from
[4146.00 --> 4152.88]  upscaling without upscaling to 4k so they could ship a 1080p display in the switch it could have
[4152.88 --> 4158.94]  smaller bezels could have a nice big screen like we're overdue for a really big screen on a switch
[4158.94 --> 4167.20]  so a giant screen and then it could render it like 720p or like 800p or something so you could take
[4167.20 --> 4174.90]  advantage of dlss of this super sampling technology but just in different ways so on your tv you're taking
[4174.90 --> 4181.04]  advantage of it to like get this crystal clear super sharp image at your on your 4k tv and in your
[4181.04 --> 4189.02]  hand you're using it to save power by rendering it a lower resolution like that's that's crazy
[4189.02 --> 4196.86]  that's crazy so i i that's that's what i want to see that's what i want to see that's i i agree with
[4196.86 --> 4203.84]  that i honestly think another switch would fly off the shelves even if they just made it like a little
[4203.84 --> 4211.70]  faster yeah and like maybe a little bit better battery life bluetooth headphones maybe green had
[4211.70 --> 4218.30]  a little bit better coverage like it has bluetooth would would make yeah dude it having bluetooth and
[4218.30 --> 4223.58]  not supporting bluetooth headphones some of the most frustrating things ever so like yeah solving like a
[4223.58 --> 4228.88]  few of those problems and just making it a little bit better in each way um i wouldn't even be surprised
[4228.88 --> 4235.10]  if they added like a c stick or something um yeah people would eat it up because it's just it's
[4235.10 --> 4244.38]  nintendo all right so i think we're probably going to have to call it for the stream for today ladies
[4244.38 --> 4251.50]  and gentlemen the arm thing oh yeah shoot okay we'll do that very quickly tick tock and we chat officially
[4251.50 --> 4257.88]  banned in the u.s as of september 20th so that's the thing uh and nvidia wants to purchase arm to
[4257.88 --> 4264.48]  basically become a fully integrated ai company so they would have cpu network and gpu basically
[4264.48 --> 4270.66]  making themselves a one-stop shop for the data center uh don't worry this won't affect um you know
[4270.66 --> 4278.90]  perpetual license arm licensees like apple um so that'll be fine but it's going to be real interesting
[4278.90 --> 4286.84]  to see apple like beholden to nvidia in any way because those two get along so well uh one last thing i have
[4286.84 --> 4292.80]  to talk about real quick here is lttstore.com is hiring it's going real successful ladies and
[4292.80 --> 4296.76]  gentlemen by the way thank you for your support we're going to have a video coming up pretty soon
[4296.76 --> 4303.84]  called how does lmg make money v 2.0 uh so the last time we did that was four years ago and things have
[4303.84 --> 4310.24]  changed a lot some things have stayed the same a lot other things have changed a lot um you guys are
[4310.24 --> 4316.08]  going to want to check that out but a big big part of our growth has been the super fans the ones that
[4316.08 --> 4321.44]  uh subscribe on floatplane the ones that uh buy stuff through our affiliate links in the video
[4321.44 --> 4329.14]  descriptions the ones that buy merch you guys are absolutely enormous um in terms of the amount like
[4329.14 --> 4334.96]  the percentage of revenue that you guys uh contribute uh people who subscribe to youtube premium for
[4334.96 --> 4340.34]  example huge difference uh so you guys have been enormous difference makers for us over the last
[4340.34 --> 4346.24]  four years compared to uh how our model used to work before and thank you very very much because you
[4346.24 --> 4351.78]  i think you guys probably sort of realize how much of a difference that you make not just to us but
[4351.78 --> 4357.44]  to any other creators that you follow and that you support directly but you might not realize how much
[4357.44 --> 4368.00]  pretty huge it's massive um so anyway we're hiring six positions graphic design fashion design pattern
[4368.00 --> 4374.78]  making we want to like triple down on custom garments uh product management customer support and web dev is
[4374.78 --> 4383.00]  that six one two three four five six yep uh and web devs web web devs so we're looking for react js
[4383.00 --> 4388.96]  experience uh so you guys can find those on linusmediagroup.com now uh for five of them and the
[4388.96 --> 4395.34]  dev possession dev position will be listed within a few days to go go check it out web dev position is
[4395.34 --> 4404.92]  mostly it's like javascript and and uh a lot of like web front end stuff okay um one additional thing i'm
[4404.92 --> 4410.90]  going to throw in here is that uh i don't know exactly how we're going to do this and uh to call it
[4410.90 --> 4418.52]  hiring you'd need some pretty serious air quotes uh because you're not getting paid but the ltt forum
[4418.52 --> 4425.98]  probably needs some developer help um colonel mortis could use some reinforcements i'm not sure how we're
[4425.98 --> 4432.94]  necessarily going to do this yet yeah how would we vet people yeah um to be clear the forum's not like a
[4432.94 --> 4437.86]  money-making thing for us either it's just something that we want to continue to support because we feel
[4437.86 --> 4442.90]  like it's really important to have and i've had people question me on this before because i describe
[4442.90 --> 4450.66]  it as like an independent community like yes we're in control of it but there are actually people on
[4450.66 --> 4456.00]  there with very high post counts that like don't even really watch anymore or care yeah we we exert
[4456.00 --> 4463.84]  very little force on the forum the only thing is like the the basic uh you know community guidelines
[4463.84 --> 4469.70]  which is you know don't be a dick and be excellent to each other that's that's pretty much it and keep
[4469.70 --> 4477.06]  it on tech topic that that's like the three basic rules there um and there's there's not a lot of
[4477.06 --> 4483.64]  forums left that are thriving the way that lt linus tech tips forum is so guys uh if you if you feel
[4483.64 --> 4488.50]  like you want to help like maybe you're a member there and and you feel like you have some experience that
[4488.50 --> 4492.90]  would be helpful just uh how are how are you getting in touch with people should they contact
[4492.90 --> 4497.22]  again we don't necessarily know yet i'm just putting the feelers out there so people know okay
[4497.22 --> 4502.16]  the type of stuff they're looking for is front-end uh designer and developer should ideally be kind
[4502.16 --> 4507.74]  of one person and some like sysadmin back-end developer stuff basically colonel mortis has been
[4507.74 --> 4514.44]  doing essentially all of this on his own for a very long time um and that is becoming less and less
[4514.44 --> 4522.80]  feasible uh we're we're looking to expand huge community it's like well over 10 million posts
[4522.80 --> 4531.62]  like actually for real um i have i have written uh letters of recommendation for people that have
[4531.62 --> 4537.50]  like actually helped them get into some cool stuff uh it it's not a paying position
[4537.50 --> 4543.72]  because it's a community forum that doesn't make money um and like we could make it make money
[4543.72 --> 4548.94]  like we could cover it in video ads and stuff but we're not going to do that because we want it to
[4548.94 --> 4555.74]  just be its own thing so all you'll find on it is like one banner ad at the top right and then links
[4555.74 --> 4562.20]  to the latest ltd videos over on like bottom right and then one banner ad at the bottom that's it so
[4562.20 --> 4566.50]  like there is some responsibilities that would come with it but for the most part it would be more of a
[4566.50 --> 4573.60]  fun side project that you can kind of work on when you want um it's yeah it's so just
[4573.60 --> 4579.28]  if you're interested keep an eye out there will be there will be something coming soon for people
[4579.28 --> 4584.32]  to be able to apply in some way i don't know all right thanks luke uh we should do a few super chats
[4584.32 --> 4591.04]  here uh sorry guys i'm not going to have time for all of them as usual uh thanks robert mail um
[4591.04 --> 4601.26]  have a little unity ipo cash says anthony markham did unity just ipo you gotta be kidding me how did i
[4601.26 --> 4609.28]  not see this unity technologies raises more than 1.3 billion in ipo 12 hours ago look at that
[4609.28 --> 4616.52]  wow how did i not know that they man i wish i uh i wish that it wasn't such an enormous actually
[4616.52 --> 4620.48]  would that even be a conflict of interest for me i don't even cover their stuff yeah probably yeah
[4620.48 --> 4627.22]  yeah oh well i own no stocks just saying wow that's crazy it went up like 42 percent
[4627.22 --> 4634.44]  yeah it's pretty nuts uh owen cullen says per the dm on twitter please um flag mental health among all
[4634.44 --> 4642.22]  age groups don't even mention me i don't care oh uh i'm a little confused i don't think i read that dm
[4642.22 --> 4650.62]  it is a shared inbox but um yes mental health issues definitely important among all age groups i mean
[4650.62 --> 4659.10]  can't disagree with that uh cell phone archaeology says so review an rtx 8000 quadro versus the 3080
[4659.10 --> 4667.26]  already really i need to know wait wait for ampere quadro there's no way that's not coming patience
[4667.26 --> 4675.44]  all right tommy gun 1928 says linus some people say you just make merch to avoid buying clothes
[4675.44 --> 4683.54]  what is your response my response that is totally unfair i also do it to avoid luke buying clothes
[4683.54 --> 4687.96]  yes thank you you're welcome it's great
[4687.96 --> 4696.76]  someone in my friend group mentioned the other day they were like why do you still do wancho and i was
[4696.76 --> 4701.68]  like it's really fun and i like hang out with linus like what do you mean they're like you don't
[4701.68 --> 4706.18]  you don't get anything from it i was like do you not see all of the clothes that i wear
[4706.18 --> 4713.80]  and water bottles and and water bottles and everything else i'm like there there are perks
[4713.80 --> 4719.30]  okay leave me alone we got to do a luke personal rig update though for sure we got to do one we got
[4719.30 --> 4727.84]  to do one we're overdue some ideas up actually we're overdue i i i um intel extreme rig upgrade i uh i i
[4727.84 --> 4733.30]  vetoed including you in that uh because i told them that we're probably just going to do something for
[4733.30 --> 4738.40]  luke separately anyway because you're at the point now where it's getting to be upgrade time so well
[4738.40 --> 4744.14]  let's let's let's chat uh there's finally new gpus there's new cpus coming so let's try and time it so
[4744.14 --> 4748.38]  that it's like okay luke doesn't need to upgrade his computer for another like five years or whatever
[4748.38 --> 4756.28]  because that's the cycle i'm trying to my thing is i got i gotta find something cool to do with it
[4756.28 --> 4762.80]  i think we could come up with something yeah i've been ramping up my my thought process there and
[4762.80 --> 4768.24]  i've had a few ideas but nothing that's like really sold me so far so all right sounds good
[4768.24 --> 4776.28]  uh dr aeroa says i'm gonna buy amd no matter what nvidia can and i think it's bleeped out
[4776.28 --> 4780.92]  all right fair enough gordon mcpherson thanks for keeping posting during the pandemic you guys are
[4780.92 --> 4785.40]  awesome please buy some pizza for the team you know what sure we could do a pizza day why not i mean
[4785.40 --> 4791.62]  i think you underestimate the uh size of my team and the cost of that pizza but tell you what just
[4791.62 --> 4797.74]  for you we will do we will celebrate the reopening of the new lounge with pizza for all some some free
[4797.74 --> 4803.96]  advertising for a small company but clayton gate pizza actually has like above i'm not gonna say
[4803.96 --> 4810.54]  it's amazing but it's above average pizza for very very cheap all right cost-effective pizza party
[4810.54 --> 4818.34]  well still we've got like three dozen people and it was like 48 so yeah we're gonna need more
[4818.34 --> 4822.22]  pizzas but that's okay that goes a long way and we're gonna do the pizza party don't you worry
[4822.22 --> 4830.56]  nice hey did you uh new left for dead new left for dead 2 map yeah what the heck right we're gonna
[4830.56 --> 4834.50]  have to play some left for dead 2 later anyway that's that's totally newsworthy that's not in a super chat
[4834.50 --> 4844.46]  um mike collins i'm never making that video slushy 2080 ti to 3090 upgrade worth it or overkill i cannot
[4844.46 --> 4852.46]  comment the 3090 um review embargo is not up yet and i definitely know more than i can tell you
[4852.46 --> 4860.56]  oh oh put the cack nick says don't forget ps5 games cost ten dollars more now sony is the only one
[4860.56 --> 4864.36]  making that move that's not going to sit well with some people even if the industry should have done it
[4864.36 --> 4872.80]  years ago that's a good point um calvin says switch is my favorite switch is the console that to my
[4872.80 --> 4877.92]  mind has something to offer beyond exclusive games i mean mostly exclusive games come on but like
[4877.92 --> 4883.22]  yes that's true the mobility is cool all right that's it for super chats i think we're gonna have
[4883.22 --> 4887.62]  to call it for the show today we are well over an hour and a half thank you guys for tuning in
[4887.62 --> 4892.96]  we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
[4892.96 --> 4903.28]  what's up with the mouse thing which one your mouse is constantly over like my camera yeah it's
[4903.28 --> 4910.12]  because i put the window behind my uh my uh my chrome window that i use for like reading chat and
[4910.12 --> 4914.58]  looking at the document and stuff and then people pointed it out that it bothered them so i started
[4914.58 --> 4921.38]  doing it on purpose oh so what like the obs window uh no no no it's over the uh
