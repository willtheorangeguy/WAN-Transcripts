[0.00 --> 7.18]  and what's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show we got a great show lined up for you guys
[7.18 --> 16.02]  this week uh oh there's some juicy tea being spilled about Nvidia being terrible to reviewers
[16.02 --> 23.86]  and partners again and another never totally unexpected news Nintendo of America wants you
[23.86 --> 32.28]  to give up the right to sue them and to give them the right to brick your console remotely man these
[32.28 --> 38.30]  guys are really like they're really trying to win the who can be the biggest scuzz bag this week
[38.30 --> 43.20]  competition aren't they yeah look at that tying it all back to the title of the video like that
[43.20 --> 47.60]  what a pro he really is ladies and gentlemen speaking it's fantastic seeing a professional
[47.60 --> 52.30]  work like this look at the way he doesn't even give his host a chance to say a word
[52.30 --> 54.60]  just talks continuously happening to
[54.60 --> 67.64]  tolerance it's tolerance uh and in the obviously all good news show we have gta 6 being delayed by
[67.64 --> 74.48]  like a year maybe and company towns are pack on the menu again let's go oh boy
[74.48 --> 79.00]  oh did we both press it uh-huh nice
[79.00 --> 103.04]  oh the show is brought to you today by odoo green man gaming and amd of course alongside our
[103.04 --> 107.38]  rap partner dbrand our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner dell
[107.38 --> 114.74]  all right they did a bit more wrapping it seems which oh yeah i saw that actually i i like i like
[114.74 --> 119.60]  and when we do after dark it'll glow it won't because we keep the lights on now but it would
[119.60 --> 130.74]  have so sick if it did it would have who do you want to do first n or n oh uh what did you think i was
[130.74 --> 137.04]  asking i mean why why would one of us wait we could do it at the same time
[137.04 --> 148.12]  uh let's go with i mean it works for beyonce let's go with shorter n yeah sure nvidia is allegedly
[148.12 --> 152.88]  i'm gonna throw in an allegedly there even though i totally believe all of this allegedly i believe it
[152.88 --> 162.58]  um after nvidia withheld the 8 gigabyte variant of the 5060 ti which led to delayed coverage um
[162.58 --> 169.00]  this is my personal theory although i think a lot of other folks agree with me delayed coverage as a
[169.00 --> 177.02]  strategy to uh bury any reviews of it so that people searching for this card would only find
[177.02 --> 186.72]  um search optimized coverage of the 16 gigabyte variant nvidia has struck again with the rtx 5060
[186.72 --> 196.30]  tech spot hardware unboxed hardware luxe and many more does many more include ltt labs many more yeah
[196.30 --> 206.30]  have confirmed that they are not receiving drivers for the rtx 5060 until its launch date may 19th
[206.30 --> 215.32]  the cherry on top is not only does this delay any non-rushed review of this card but may 19th
[215.32 --> 223.94]  is the first day of computex meaning that i mean this says several but i would say many reviewers won't
[223.94 --> 230.00]  be able to test the card at all since they are going to be working on the show floor doing coverage of
[230.00 --> 234.96]  all the cool tech that you guys want to hear about i do think less reviewers are going to shows these
[234.96 --> 240.54]  days but it's still true i mean we're going to be there yeah i'm gonna have some fun i love computex
[240.54 --> 245.74]  i'm like in time i'm actually excited to play badminton and also computex was there genuinely
[245.74 --> 252.06]  though i do i do enjoy computex more than ces i never got to do c-bit which i heard was really good
[252.06 --> 258.56]  but i computex is my favorite of the remaining the remaining shows that i have been to me too for
[258.56 --> 263.78]  sure all right here's a very off-topic question just to get the show started off right wasn't quite
[263.78 --> 267.54]  done with that topic but sure we can come back are you going to be able to go to badminton centers
[267.54 --> 273.20]  in taiwan without just like inspecting everything oh don't imagine that i wasn't already doing that
[273.20 --> 279.14]  for years i mean i i've i've wanted to build my own center for i think my first email to my realtor
[279.14 --> 285.76]  was over five years ago so like dude i've been i've been on it i've been on it no buddy my buddy
[285.76 --> 291.28]  over there who runs like half a dozen centers when i was there last year and i think was like in the
[291.28 --> 296.76]  process of opening up two more because the year before when i went there he had just opened one center
[296.76 --> 304.86]  and i was like dude you did a great job i can't believe the budget you did this on the the demand for
[304.86 --> 311.18]  this is so high and completely unmet every time i come here it's like impossible to find a court
[311.18 --> 316.06]  you should just like do more of this but like you know that's not you know advice or anything like
[316.06 --> 320.70]  i didn't want to be responsible for like his whole financial situation so i come back a year later
[320.70 --> 328.90]  and he f***ing went all in and started up like five more centers and he was like and i owe you all
[328.90 --> 333.48]  i owe you for it all because i wouldn't have done it if you like didn't tell me to do it and i was like
[333.48 --> 337.84]  yo dog you owe me nothing for one thing i don't want to be on the hook for that because if it had
[337.84 --> 343.24]  gone terrible you definitely would have owed me nothing in that situation too this is all on you
[343.24 --> 349.52]  you did a great job but apparently he's killing it like just killing it so anyway i'm gonna go i'm
[349.52 --> 355.42]  gonna go see my buddy when i'm over there but um where was i going with this i forget so yeah i've
[355.42 --> 361.76]  been scoping them out yeah okay anyway the point is several outlets are once again accusing
[361.76 --> 368.58]  nvidia of trying to bury any negative coverage of this card um before the cards hit the shelves
[368.58 --> 374.62]  and consumers start ordering i can't think of another explanation i have not heard one but here's
[374.62 --> 383.48]  the thing like i don't i can't fathom nvidia at this point because on the one hand they like play
[383.48 --> 389.50]  these silly games and they will they will swear up and down that they are not playing games in
[389.50 --> 395.16]  situations like this that they that the drivers just weren't quite ready yet or whatever right
[395.16 --> 404.02]  but if the drivers aren't ready yet then just delay it okay so we can we can poke logical holes
[404.02 --> 413.76]  in any argument around this right you are playing games right okay so now that we've established you
[413.76 --> 419.90]  are playing games the question is why yeah what's the point because every other aspect of your
[419.90 --> 430.24]  behavior indicates you don't give a fuck about these value oriented g-force cards so why the stakes are
[430.24 --> 440.50]  so low for you just they i've called for this before i'm gonna do it again spin off g-force
[440.50 --> 448.32]  just spin it off as a separate business unit then you don't have to worry about the crappy p&l
[448.32 --> 457.94]  that's like mucking up your beautiful ai the self-driving machine vision you know freaking uh
[457.94 --> 465.02]  digits like grid like beautiful balance sheet right it can just sit over there and have like
[465.02 --> 471.40]  crappier margins and a bunch of retail customers that are like a ton of work and like are whining
[471.40 --> 478.06]  at you all the time and you got this tech media that basically has a borderline adversarial
[478.06 --> 484.76]  relationship with you at this point you just go silo that off you license the chip technology to them
[484.76 --> 491.78]  they do they handle all the g-force drivers and everything why not what is the argument against it
[491.78 --> 497.78]  at this point because they clearly like you look at how botched the 50 series launch has been
[497.78 --> 503.70]  they clearly don't have their eye on the prize they're not on the ball when it comes to g-force
[503.70 --> 508.24]  because they're demotivated all the money isn't working on this other stuff so you need to have a
[508.24 --> 516.78]  separate bu or even even i dare say separate company nvidia g-force call it g-force gaming
[516.78 --> 523.80]  corp or something who cares you have this separate company whose entire job is to crush it in g-force
[523.80 --> 533.38]  is to delight gamers you know like you used to because i just i just don't understand it they say
[533.38 --> 540.70]  there's no game right but like and like what is the point of way lower importance and it like has to be
[540.70 --> 545.58]  when looking at their financial statements but when you look at like the original ces announcement of
[545.58 --> 552.34]  the 5000 series he still led with g-force stuff the vast majority of the presentation the hook
[552.34 --> 556.78]  no i know but if that's still the hook then i don't think you split it off
[556.78 --> 564.58]  i'm not convinced that the average nvidia data center procurer you know chief procurement
[564.58 --> 571.44]  person at some you know ai thing i'm not convinced that they really give two hoots about how good a
[571.44 --> 576.38]  rtx whatever is i'm i don't i don't know man for sure but there might be an expectation that they do
[576.38 --> 585.72]  and if you get that chief procurer guy to buy a 5090 i do think there's a higher chance that that
[585.72 --> 590.42]  person will have some type of bias towards that sure but there's plenty of cases where you have
[590.42 --> 595.88]  somewhat affiliated affiliated excuse me affiliated companies who cross-license technology between
[595.88 --> 602.38]  them and they could still they you could even call it like nvidia corp and nvidia gaming corp right
[602.38 --> 610.24]  like there's there's no reason not to still you know retain some nvidia you know branding retain
[610.24 --> 615.24]  some association the the beginning of that keynote could have been we're excited to announce with our
[615.24 --> 622.00]  partner g-force corp the based on our all-new architecture the the g-force whatever jensen could
[622.00 --> 628.44]  even jensen could even hire himself as the ceo of the other company i don't care the point is just
[628.44 --> 633.66]  that they got to get it off the balance sheet so they can get realistic about what consumers can
[633.66 --> 639.24]  afford in terms of their margins i don't think it's going to change what do you what do you mean by
[639.24 --> 643.40]  realistic in terms of what consumers can afford because they're selling everything right now anyways
[643.40 --> 650.64]  so like in regards to what they will pay which is all that they actually care about not what can they
[650.64 --> 658.12]  afford um they're doing it so maybe they are really realistic about it like if we're just being
[658.12 --> 663.48]  honest because every time that there's been a gpu shortage or you know everybody buying cards for
[663.48 --> 668.48]  mining or whatever they've flown off the shelves every time and consumers have shown that they'll buy
[668.48 --> 675.80]  scalped gpus for three thousand dollars a pop because they want four more fps in fortnite um like this
[675.80 --> 683.00]  you just can't use the word realistic when they're like out of stock everywhere
[683.00 --> 690.62]  and that's the other hole that i can poke in their we're not playing games story they're going to be
[690.62 --> 695.98]  out of stock anyway yeah so launch it that's the biggest one for me so launch it a week later
[695.98 --> 703.40]  or two weeks later it doesn't matter keep keep the production going full tilt which you obviously
[703.40 --> 708.52]  haven't been doing anyway yeah produce as much as you can and you're still going to sell it on launch
[708.52 --> 712.60]  day anyway just in case that's confusing for people he means because they're putting production towards
[712.60 --> 718.16]  data center stuff instead of these cards with that said with that said prices have started to creep
[718.16 --> 724.34]  down a little bit they're creeping down though i don't think that's nvidia stated prices not as no no
[724.34 --> 730.16]  no because well they've never officially changed the msrps so yeah but the street prices are
[730.16 --> 738.24]  slowly ticking their way down there's not really any pressure on them on the high end but i there's none
[738.24 --> 744.66]  you know what i'm taking some validation here i'm gonna do a little victory lap i know unusual thing
[744.66 --> 750.56]  go ahead press the button but he doesn't know i'm pretty sure well anyway
[750.56 --> 761.36]  i think that intel's presence in the market is a threat oh yeah i mean i hope so dude that's that's
[761.36 --> 772.16]  the theory that i've clung to and battle mage seems legit like and seems to be selling legit like do you
[772.16 --> 777.14]  see how many board partners they have now like that's an indication i haven't looked into that dude
[777.14 --> 782.64]  dude we're at the point now where they're like almost breaking into brands you would have
[782.64 --> 788.42]  considered buying a gpu from before intel gpus existed i know it's not like it got a low amount
[788.42 --> 794.02]  of views it got it got over a million views but this video is very interesting and if you haven't
[794.02 --> 799.10]  watched it you should go watch it it's not just like oh did i have bugs or not the conclusion is
[799.10 --> 803.92]  very interesting and how they both got to their individual conclusions is very interesting you should
[803.92 --> 811.02]  go watch the video like you could you can buy an arc b580 from like acer or asrock asrock i'd say is
[811.02 --> 817.86]  like the closest we're getting to like a real add-in board partner when i start seeing like you know
[817.86 --> 824.48]  msi gigabyte asus putting their necks out to want to be part of the arc train then i'm gonna i'm gonna
[824.48 --> 831.06]  really be a believer um but at least it's not at least it's not all you know onyx
[831.06 --> 836.96]  yeah onyx does seem to be a significant player for intel here so there does seem to be a little
[836.96 --> 844.02]  bit of desperation factor but they're not the only one anymore and that's that's exciting to me so i
[844.02 --> 850.52]  i i'm i'm gonna say hey i'm i'm glad i'm i'm standing behind everything i said about the importance
[850.52 --> 856.88]  of intel being part of this and like we said in the title of that video luke just popped up
[856.88 --> 866.18]  please please intel do not can discrete graphics please because the thing is it's not like they're
[866.18 --> 873.00]  going to stop development of arc arc is a key strategic piece for them continuing to compete
[873.00 --> 879.86]  with amd on mobility so it's not like it's not like celestial and druid are not going to be developed
[879.86 --> 885.96]  it's just a question of whether we're going to get the large scale more power hungry ones that would go
[885.96 --> 893.96]  in an add-in gpu and it it is not a good sign that b770 the bigger card for this generation is
[893.96 --> 899.38]  allegedly canceled although i did see a rumor that allegedly it is like uncanceled or maybe was never
[899.38 --> 905.70]  canceled and maybe is still coming dude the rumor mill around intel's gpus have actually has actually
[905.70 --> 913.66]  been horrible oh i know like it's been way more inflammatory and also inaccurate than most rumor mill
[913.66 --> 919.90]  cycles oh dude i'm not going to name a particular youtuber but there's a particular youtuber that on
[919.90 --> 926.90]  like a super regular basis would be talking about how arc is definitely canceled now like repeatedly to
[926.90 --> 933.70]  the point where i'm just like dude even a broken clock is right a couple times a day like can you
[933.70 --> 938.50]  just can you just not even bother anymore at this point because like i just got tired of reading it
[938.50 --> 943.34]  yeah and other sites would just would just pick up these rumors and just run with them and i'm like
[943.34 --> 949.44]  do you have any idea how stressful that is to the people that actually work within that department
[949.44 --> 954.78]  that are just kind of rough like what what what what what and then and then it turns out to not even
[954.78 --> 962.70]  be true and we 100% get arc battle mage it's like okay so what was this based on like i who knows
[962.70 --> 969.98]  i don't know man i don't know man yeah anyway no i'm not no i'm not gonna name and shame i'm not
[969.98 --> 975.58]  interested in naming and shaming but apparently b770 is anticipated to feel you know what i'm not
[975.58 --> 982.38]  even gonna read these specs but i really hope i really hope it happens because battle mage man
[982.38 --> 986.74]  let's go all right what else we got what else we got you want to talk about the other big one
[986.74 --> 996.24]  sure why not can nintendo just like be likable no for once like i just dude i just wanna it's kind
[996.24 --> 1003.48]  of like okay okay what's it like okay it's like if you love kit kats you know and you just you just
[1003.48 --> 1009.92]  want to enjoy your kit kat without thinking about all the fucking water this company is stealing
[1009.92 --> 1017.40]  from all the poorest people on earth nestle yeah and you're just like i can't even enjoy this
[1017.40 --> 1027.50]  i just want to guilt-free enjoy mario okay i i just i just i don't wanna i don't want to think
[1027.50 --> 1032.54]  about the beast that i'm feeding can you even like would something like this oh no i'm sorry
[1032.54 --> 1041.28]  kabi kit kat is nestle why i right i know so many things are nice i love kit kats turns out it's
[1041.28 --> 1048.02]  easy to be profitable when you're just objectively evil oh yeah yeah dude i mean look we're pretty
[1048.02 --> 1053.36]  profitable and i don't i don't think i don't think we do imagine how much more profitable think about
[1053.36 --> 1060.26]  all the gambling sponsorships right oh my all the alcohol sponsorships we could have taken over the
[1060.26 --> 1066.58]  years yeah and the number of people that hate us anyway it's like what what was even the point
[1066.58 --> 1075.70]  oh apparently uh kit kat is nestle in canada but hershey in the usa oh what really uh are i think
[1075.70 --> 1084.78]  arty said that uh oh yeah i did not know is what what oh thank goodness says copy
[1084.78 --> 1093.44]  oh man yeah anyway okay well i just so i just have to go down well okay nestle does not own the
[1093.44 --> 1098.72]  hershey company nestle does have a licensing agreement with hershey to manufacture and distribute kit kat and
[1098.72 --> 1102.68]  rollo products in the united states however hershey is a separate independent company that's a
[1102.68 --> 1110.46]  ai overview from the l google okay well hopefully that's uh accurate either way it's okay yeah kit kat okay
[1110.46 --> 1119.54]  so all i have to do is go down to the states buy a ton of kit kats get to the border hope that i can
[1119.54 --> 1127.00]  cross the border and that they don't have any questions about the mountain of kit kats in my trunk
[1127.00 --> 1131.78]  apparently there are many products that are owned by hershey's but they are still licensed and produced
[1131.78 --> 1142.86]  by nestle oh i see so nestle is probably profiting in some way nice nice anyway nintendo is under fire
[1142.86 --> 1150.08]  once again after adding a clause to their end user license agreement that asks users to waive their
[1150.08 --> 1160.04]  right to join a class action lawsuit joy-con driftgate anyone users can still sue individually
[1160.04 --> 1166.44]  or they can waive the arbitration notice by sending a written letter to nintendo of america's office
[1166.44 --> 1173.66]  but nintendo is instructing users to contact customer service instead as most matters can be quickly
[1173.66 --> 1182.22]  resolved in this manner um to our customer satisfaction which is fair enough in which case you shouldn't need
[1182.22 --> 1191.54]  an arbitrary uh you should uh sorry uh you shouldn't need to um have a thing that waives arbitration yes
[1191.54 --> 1197.08]  thank you that's the words i was looking for appreciate you i knew you were here for the reason why i do all the
[1197.08 --> 1203.60]  talking does that hold up in court like ever i know you can't answer this but like i think if you give
[1203.60 --> 1209.26]  people the right to waive it there's a solid chance and i mean realistically realistically oh my god i can't
[1209.26 --> 1214.02]  believe we're doing this again realistically it's kind of like the whole warranty thing it's not about
[1214.02 --> 1219.62]  whether nintendo is allowed to do that okay apparently legal eagle said no as well yeah it's about it's
[1219.62 --> 1225.30]  about what are the obstacles and what are the what this will muddy the waters for sure it'll muddy the
[1225.30 --> 1230.92]  waters it will make it take more time and it will make it more expensive yeah so even if you could go out
[1230.92 --> 1239.22]  and get like an outstanding lawyer who could be like actually nintendo no the barrier to entry is
[1239.22 --> 1246.00]  going to be higher right to break through this yeah and that's what nintendo is doing that's what
[1246.00 --> 1252.00]  creating it almost feels like a reminder of who they are because we already know yeah from personal
[1252.00 --> 1261.10]  experience that lawyers are scared of nintendo remember we do know that yeah we do so this
[1261.10 --> 1268.68]  almost feels like a reminder or like a you know um don't open the gate there's a dog you know yeah
[1268.68 --> 1275.08]  you can see the dog you can hear the dog but there's also a sign this feels like the sign it's just man
[1275.08 --> 1279.68]  it's it's frustrating and i think i think it's also one of those things where they're creating an
[1279.68 --> 1287.42]  environment nintendo is the gorilla yeah that's a fun the the hundred men which is the lawyers
[1287.42 --> 1296.22]  anyway sorry can a hundred lawyers defeat nintendo it also feels like they're trying to to make the
[1296.22 --> 1303.20]  individual user feel like i mean even even the simple fact of us talking about this is going to
[1303.20 --> 1309.24]  make nintendo's users feel like oh it's pointless because they're doing this arbitration thing
[1309.24 --> 1314.76]  i'm not gonna send no letter ain't nobody got time for that so realistically i've agreed to this so
[1314.76 --> 1321.82]  you know whatever and the stupidest part is what nintendo said is completely true they could satisfy
[1321.82 --> 1328.86]  people by just sending them a new stupid joy-con so then why do they need this clause just in case
[1328.86 --> 1334.20]  they decide they don't want to and that's where i get back to the whole warranty thing that's why
[1334.20 --> 1340.36]  every warranty has outs in it because it's written for the protection of the company and has nothing
[1340.36 --> 1346.12]  to do with protecting the user and it doesn't matter how good guy they are and how trust me bro
[1346.12 --> 1352.04]  they are at the end of the day it just comes down to their willingness in that moment with that current
[1352.04 --> 1359.02]  leadership team because those change to fulfill to honor your request so nintendo knows that they could
[1359.02 --> 1363.96]  fix this problem by sending you a new flipping joy-con but they're putting this clause in to make sure
[1364.20 --> 1369.06]  if they are ever in a position where they don't feel like it they don't have to the interpretation
[1369.06 --> 1374.04]  or at least people will think they don't have to read elsewhere was that this was like is this
[1374.04 --> 1381.00]  it's actually really about joy-cons so i thought this was um no it's probably not modding switches i
[1381.00 --> 1385.40]  don't think it's about joy-cons them them being able to brick your switch oh no that's a separate one
[1385.40 --> 1391.44]  oh that's the other one separately they have updated the account agreement to reserve the right
[1391.44 --> 1404.24]  to make your console permanently unusable aka brick it if you lease rent sub license publish copy modify
[1404.24 --> 1414.00]  adapt translate reverse engineer decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the nintendo account services
[1414.00 --> 1416.80]  bruh
[1416.80 --> 1419.92]  nice
[1419.92 --> 1423.76]  so this was the topic i was reading that's why you
[1423.76 --> 1430.48]  one thousand percent do not own the nintendo console you buy anymore which would be fine
[1431.28 --> 1438.56]  it would be more fine if we were still in the era of like carts that actually had all the game data on
[1438.56 --> 1446.00]  them and that actually worked completely without nintendo's online services but is way worse
[1446.80 --> 1452.96]  in the era of carts that don't have game data on them and that nintendo can just decide at some point
[1453.76 --> 1459.76]  or could stop existing at some point however unlikely and they just like don't work anymore
[1459.76 --> 1465.76]  and it's like illegal or whatever to try to get it working they can probably ban individual carts too
[1465.76 --> 1472.00]  dude this is this is crazy this is crazy i wonder if they detected that a cart was being used too
[1472.00 --> 1478.00]  many times if they would ban it uh i don't know if there's a uses i do i do think this is one of those
[1478.00 --> 1484.16]  things that again they they'd probably want to be too trustworthy a bro to just do this all the time
[1484.80 --> 1493.36]  but it does definitely give them tools to go after the modding community especially you know anyone who's
[1493.36 --> 1501.60]  um trying to unlock homebrew gaming on their switch too in a way that they potentially haven't before
[1501.60 --> 1507.20]  and especially anyone who tries to enable any kind of online functionality i think that's the thing that
[1507.20 --> 1512.08]  this is mostly going after especially because they they make it clear that this is part of the account
[1512.08 --> 1516.96]  agreement and they are specifically referring to nintendo account services um
[1516.96 --> 1527.36]  um either way it is very clear that nintendo is tightening the noose when it comes to emulation uh
[1527.36 --> 1528.24]  console hacking
[1530.96 --> 1538.56]  look as someone who buys my nintendo games like this doesn't impact me financially but as someone
[1538.56 --> 1545.20]  this will change the purchase purchasing decision of extremely few people but as someone who really
[1545.20 --> 1553.68]  likes emulation for lots of other reasons and as someone who cares about archiving and preserving
[1553.68 --> 1561.36]  game history i am not stoked is is what i'll kind of say about that um this is a great great comment
[1561.36 --> 1569.52]  in chat from uh oh but yeah hatho says a million plus people playing tears of the kingdom before launch
[1569.52 --> 1576.56]  on yuzu really set nintendo down a harsh path and i guess i can i can i can understand that to a degree
[1576.56 --> 1583.52]  i mean it's not like nintendo doesn't have evidence like real hard evidence to point to that they have
[1583.52 --> 1591.76]  been impacted and if you're gonna pull out that tired argument that there's no proof that piracy ever
[1591.76 --> 1598.08]  affected the the income of the those million people wouldn't have bought the game and stop
[1599.12 --> 1606.00]  really you're gonna tell me out of a million people none of them it's yeah it's not it's not a one-to-one
[1606.00 --> 1614.80]  you can actually stop now there was uh cases back in the day i think with like napster and stuff oh yeah
[1614.80 --> 1621.12]  100 where where they the the the lawsuit was based on a one-to-one loss which is why people quote that
[1621.12 --> 1627.76]  which is legitimate obviously stupid yes nintendo did not lose out on a million sales i think it's
[1627.76 --> 1633.52]  but it also wasn't zero yeah i think it's somewhere in the middle but i think it shifts closer towards
[1633.52 --> 1640.80]  the zero side than the million side and significantly closer towards either way if it was 10 then it's
[1640.80 --> 1646.56]  still if it was five percent it's still a lot it was a big number yeah and that's that's the bottom
[1646.56 --> 1652.72]  line right large sum of is is companies will only ignore this stuff until it hits their bottom line
[1652.72 --> 1660.64]  hard enough that the cost of dealing with it iron-fisted is less than the cost of absorbing these
[1660.64 --> 1670.24]  activities and that's where we're at i think i think um nintendo's opinion on that is a little bit more
[1670.80 --> 1678.00]  on the rather deal with it iron-fisted side oh yeah 100 given their precedence unique username goes
[1678.00 --> 1687.60]  actually with the correct spelling a ck s c h u a l l y pirates helped nintendo sell more copies by word
[1687.60 --> 1695.60]  of mouth oh that that that argument is also exhausting it's like it very good it literally makes me tired
[1695.60 --> 1700.72]  immediately i know you're kidding i know i know you keep it up i know you're kidding but that it
[1700.72 --> 1705.28]  when i see that when i see that kind of stuff unironically i just i'm just like you gotta wear
[1705.28 --> 1710.72]  them down i'm so tired also if you think that nintendo cares at all about word of mouth marketing
[1710.72 --> 1718.16]  um may i present exhibit a every game streamer that they've ever stomped on who's like speed running
[1718.16 --> 1724.48]  their games or like doing something really cool like collecting all the korok seeds or whatever
[1724.48 --> 1731.84]  that nintendo has dmca nintendo don't give a f**k at all about word of mouth marketing i tell you what
[1731.84 --> 1734.24]  uh all right what else we got today
[1736.32 --> 1742.64]  dan oh are you if you've got lots of topics are you buried in merch messages or something no i've got
[1742.64 --> 1748.64]  like three okay cool just dealing with some other stuff um if you've got lots of topics you're like
[1748.64 --> 1752.96]  15 minutes ahead so you could move on to another one if you want okay we do another topic yeah something
[1752.96 --> 1757.60]  like a real job or something yeah i'm trying to do at the same time oh okay hey did you fix my air
[1757.60 --> 1765.36]  table issue did you submit a feedback request i emailed infra which one i i just like when i get
[1765.36 --> 1770.96]  a notice how did you email infra that's all i know how to do you emailed infra yeah not only is that the
[1770.96 --> 1775.04]  wrong thing to do i'll fix it right now that's not even the right thing to do if you're trying to
[1775.04 --> 1780.72]  contact infra about an issue which isn't what you were trying to do here yes it was no i was trying
[1780.72 --> 1785.36]  to contact them about you're trying to submit an air table when did you say every single air table page
[1785.92 --> 1792.96]  all of them have a button on it to submit feedback are you sure yeah it might be some of them how sure are
[1792.96 --> 1800.48]  you because i when did you submit this feedback uh i've done it twice now uh once was at some point
[1800.48 --> 1807.84]  and then the other time was today uh today yeah well i don't know man i'm just i got a thing i got
[1807.84 --> 1812.72]  a thing i got i got a link in my email it was like oh you gotta but somebody mentioned you on air
[1812.72 --> 1818.48]  table and i was like oh okay and i clicked it and then it sent me to this page and i was like what is
[1818.48 --> 1823.20]  this what is what is this page i don't understand this page look i clicked view comment i want to view
[1823.20 --> 1828.88]  the comment and i don't know where this one's gonna go maybe it's gonna go to the and i just go to
[1828.88 --> 1834.24]  here i don't know what this is that's not particularly helpful i just scroll infinitely
[1834.24 --> 1839.52]  and did you open a ticket about i scroll for no i emailed infra i don't have access to that email
[1840.08 --> 1846.24]  well maybe you should you just did you just like again that is just has i think literally never been
[1846.24 --> 1851.92]  the right way diet demi me says i love the parts of when that show the realities of medium-sized company
[1851.92 --> 1859.52]  life did you just not there yet no no we have an infra alias for lmg i i meant that one yeah yeah
[1860.48 --> 1864.56]  that's okay can you send that to me i'll have to dig it up because that's not
[1865.76 --> 1869.92]  well it just sent me to it sent me to the look look look this is not user error i clicked a thing
[1869.92 --> 1874.96]  and it sent me to like this random page that just has a bunch of random no i understand that's not user
[1874.96 --> 1880.16]  error sure we can fix stuff but it's just well you made it sound like i should i should automatically
[1880.16 --> 1883.92]  know that i should submit a ticket through here or something i'm like there's no ticket on the
[1883.92 --> 1888.16]  desktop side i know why that i'll punch you would take i'll punch your ticket let's go
[1889.44 --> 1893.76]  on the desktop site there should be a button in the top right hand corner but also what year is it
[1893.76 --> 1900.08]  do you not have phones i know why that happened desktop i know why that happened luke it's fine i
[1900.64 --> 1909.12]  my problem is he's like i don't know at least at least when you look luke luke luke and that's okay
[1909.12 --> 1916.88]  i'm gonna let you finish but i do not even know how to submit a ticket i know i have no idea i know
[1916.88 --> 1923.92]  nobody even onboarded me to air table that literally has not happened yet and that's fine but if you
[1923.92 --> 1929.84]  have a problem you can don't don't just like send an email to a random it's not random it's
[1929.84 --> 1936.96]  infra but there's official ways to send in tickets to infra which is not that nobody ever told me that
[1936.96 --> 1942.72]  yes we did no no yes we did whenever i email infra they just deal with my problem because it's you
[1942.72 --> 1946.80]  not because you're doing it right i'm just telling you they don't tell me to do it differently they
[1946.80 --> 1952.48]  just deal with my problem linus and future just dm me and yell at me but they tell me not to dm dan
[1953.36 --> 1958.80]  you you you get special rules special old boy i gotta scroll through the general chat for like a
[1958.80 --> 1962.88]  million years until i find the post where we tell everyone how to do this oh there's i don't read
[1962.88 --> 1968.24]  that why would you read that i only nobody reads anything luke no no it happened today with the
[1968.24 --> 1971.92]  group chat i don't want to talk to you about it right now but we're going to talk after the show
[1971.92 --> 1977.68]  do you have any idea like how many channels i'm in i think i know what you're talking if you don't tag me
[1978.24 --> 1984.48]  i don't read it if you email me i don't read it you gotta dm me so i go oh god no if all emails are bad
[1984.48 --> 1991.44]  dude if all i ever did was just or sorry if i read everything that anyone ever sent me every channel
[1991.44 --> 1995.84]  that i'm in i would literally do nothing else all day i can't it's why did you actually because
[1995.84 --> 2001.44]  normally you you email me no yeah but no you have no idea how often i email in for it the
[2002.72 --> 2008.00]  the last the last air table issue that you had you cc'd be on it oh yeah it just felt unnecessary
[2008.56 --> 2012.56]  because why do you need to read it it's just a random it's it seems like just a linking issue
[2012.56 --> 2019.36]  because it is it is yeah yeah because you're not but they'll solve it for me yeah that is the marching
[2019.36 --> 2022.64]  orders but it's still not proper
[2025.04 --> 2030.72]  because i can't like i want to go home anyways you'll go home when you're done with air table
[2030.72 --> 2036.80]  i can't do this anymore he's never going home then it feels like it already oh i clicked the wrong
[2036.80 --> 2042.24]  single sign and i love that no from like from your presentation it's it's never over yeah yeah that's
[2042.24 --> 2047.68]  what dan said he literally got up in front of the entire company at an all hands and was like when is
[2047.68 --> 2058.88]  air table done never and everyone was like oh cool that should be what people want uh yeah because
[2058.88 --> 2064.00]  it'll always get better no no we understand we understood what you meant dan dan oh no oh dad
[2064.56 --> 2069.68]  see you don't understand because you don't see all the communication about air table jesus christ i can't
[2069.68 --> 2075.20]  you can't let's uh let's just stomp on the single person more that's a that's a good idea that's why i'm here
[2075.20 --> 2080.00]  i'm the boot goop hey how else are the boots gonna get clean
[2080.00 --> 2087.84]  i'll do whatever you want just be nice to me
[2090.16 --> 2093.04]  anything for a head pat oh my god
[2096.16 --> 2097.84]  what are we supposed to do
[2098.40 --> 2105.04]  you were in the middle of a topic what was it i don't remember i don't think we were i'm dealing with emails
[2105.04 --> 2111.20]  i don't think we started a topic um why don't we do why don't we do the thing let's do the let's
[2111.20 --> 2120.24]  do the thing with the merch messages sure okay i need some merch messages um oh we have deals
[2120.24 --> 2128.88]  and new items on ltt store this weekend what what no i want to know i want to know what it is
[2128.88 --> 2134.08]  we're going luke cam until you explain you're supposed to explain merch messages you said let's
[2134.08 --> 2142.16]  do the merch messages thing in the oh oh yeah well okay so luke luke made a startling discovery
[2142.16 --> 2148.16]  that his co-host has adhd congratulations there's a reason why i didn't stop you
[2152.96 --> 2160.72]  okay merch messages we don't do super chats we don't do twitch bits we do merch messages all you
[2160.72 --> 2165.84]  got to do to interact with the show and send a little message over to producer dan is head to
[2165.84 --> 2171.12]  lttstore.com add something to your cart you'll get a little box that'll pop up when we're live you can
[2171.12 --> 2177.04]  leave a merch message and dan will either reply to it or forward it to the correct person internally or
[2177.04 --> 2186.56]  he will curate it for me and luke to answer on the show so i'm supposed to now let dan read one
[2186.56 --> 2192.16]  merch message i this is hilarious you guys check this out in the doc okay in the announcement
[2192.16 --> 2199.68]  section there is this block of text i have been told that this block of text has existed for well
[2199.68 --> 2205.68]  over a year yeah it doesn't sound right to me i had never read it that sounds a little hyperbolic
[2205.68 --> 2210.16]  dan did you did you tell us did you tell us this last week or two weeks ago it's been there for many
[2210.16 --> 2216.80]  weeks are they considering last like i did not say it was there in 2024 okay well i i don't know
[2216.80 --> 2222.80]  i was told it has been there for i have never seen it i have never noticed it because i have this thing
[2222.80 --> 2227.92]  where i just sort of filter out irrelevant information and it seemed irrelevant when everything's bold
[2228.48 --> 2232.80]  nothing is bold the thing is you know what i'm saying we had talked about this a couple weeks ago
[2232.80 --> 2239.60]  and i think i clarified that it's actually for me and i was not really expecting you guys to ever read
[2239.60 --> 2244.40]  instructions in the doc because that's not your job right so so so so we've been given a hard time
[2244.40 --> 2248.64]  about doing all the merch messages in the wrong order and the announcements and whatever and we're
[2248.64 --> 2256.08]  like what order and they're like yo it's right there and i was like oh okay so let's do one merch message
[2256.64 --> 2261.52]  go ahead dan hit me now i was just wanting to read the flow plane announcements because i'm i'm with you guys
[2261.52 --> 2270.80]  okay fine fine fine stop what are you even doing i'm making it more effective no you said when
[2270.80 --> 2276.32]  everything's bold nothing is bold yeah well look so i'm making half of it there now now everything's
[2276.32 --> 2284.96]  bold and nothing is bold my amazing work has been overwritten it was so beautiful i guess guess it was
[2284.96 --> 2287.76]  stop
[2294.08 --> 2296.32]  there i have some zel go text i hate working here
[2299.28 --> 2304.40]  hey lld any chance you can provide an update on the status of custom ldd cables i'm planning on
[2304.40 --> 2309.28]  overhauling my setup and i want to wait so i can buy cables made by your team thanks they are in
[2309.28 --> 2316.80]  certification the samples i've seen are flipping awesome they're not going to be cheap but they are
[2316.80 --> 2327.36]  going to be flipping awesome um i think i think the certification is being done like post production
[2327.36 --> 2333.60]  of the raw cable but pre cutting of the lengths and putting terminations on them so i i think a lot
[2333.60 --> 2338.72]  of the production is actually done with that said even though the company that we're working with is not
[2338.72 --> 2358.40]  in china the productions in china because we started this project like two years ago or something like that so um for my american friends uh the cables may be out of the reach um for the price but uh
[2360.24 --> 2368.64]  cool uh for the rest of the world we are we are doing some serious work on um getting our global shipping rates
[2368.64 --> 2373.52]  down that is something that we're we are working very hard on i've been informed that i misspoke
[2373.52 --> 2378.96]  last week when i said that we have been subsidizing global shipping with us shipping what the situation
[2378.96 --> 2384.48]  actually was was we consolidate our shipments from canada and send them to the us because it is cheaper
[2384.48 --> 2392.24]  to ship from the us so our shipping is more expensive now because we are shipping directly from canada
[2392.24 --> 2399.92]  not because anybody was subsidizing anyone but what i said about the about the um the more urban postal codes
[2399.92 --> 2405.20]  subsidizing the more rural postal codes that's just i think that's how literally everything works
[2405.20 --> 2409.28]  that is true and that is how literally everything works that's why your internet plan
[2409.60 --> 2416.56]  in rural missouri costs an affordable amount of money theoretically somewhat but you probably get terrible service
[2416.56 --> 2421.44]  affordable amount of money um instead of just not existing at all you still probably have terrible
[2421.44 --> 2426.16]  service that's just how it works um so yeah i just wanted to i wanted to clarify that anyway we're
[2426.16 --> 2432.40]  working on our shipping rates worldwide and um so hopefully we'll be moving a lot of cables that are
[2432.40 --> 2436.24]  super high quality but i don't know how many of them are going to go to the states unless we can
[2437.04 --> 2442.64]  maybe we can figure out some way to highly transformatively do something to them here in canada
[2442.64 --> 2447.92]  whether i i don't i don't know i don't know but right now it looks like that's going to be a made in
[2447.92 --> 2456.48]  china product and it could be a real challenge with that said i think that the um i think the tariff
[2456.48 --> 2463.12]  situation is highly highly fluid and i i don't know with sort of how things are going i mean people are
[2463.12 --> 2467.60]  already starting to talk about the midterm elections right so with how things are going and how public
[2467.60 --> 2475.04]  sentiment is on the tariffs even now before the real impact has really been felt um i think there's
[2475.04 --> 2485.84]  a solid chance that they will be reduced but i need to i get here there you go nice yeah there you go
[2485.84 --> 2490.40]  who's even gonna run i don't know well no no no midterm elections are are for uh senate in the house
[2490.40 --> 2498.40]  and and it tends to be that you know whatever the president's popularity is tends to impact that
[2498.40 --> 2504.64]  makes sense the other races yeah um so now that we've read a merch message do we want to explain
[2504.64 --> 2512.56]  them this is hilarious kumo star says no it's actually cheaper to run your own fiber in bum Missouri
[2512.56 --> 2518.16]  yeah that's uh that is so that's why i said you get bad service yeah because you'll be on like very
[2518.16 --> 2523.68]  updated yeah yeah yeah yeah um yeah yeah yeah sorry did i not explain them the monthly no i don't think
[2523.68 --> 2527.92]  so yeah i explain merch messages they go in the cart and they put the merch message and then dan does
[2527.92 --> 2532.16]  the thing i totally did it you tuned out okay see that's the thing he doesn't talk but he doesn't
[2532.16 --> 2538.32]  listen either he's he really is like silent bob like he was that one time i love that you actually
[2538.32 --> 2542.40]  have done what you said you were going to do and you just only wear these shirts now yeah so we need to
[2542.40 --> 2548.64]  get some graphic tees in the lungs that would be wonderful yeah okay hey i was packing for my trip
[2548.64 --> 2559.92]  and i was like um oops all black shirts dude i touched a sample from south america for our t-shirts
[2559.92 --> 2567.36]  that was quite good oh yeah we're still months away from being able to transition i have no idea if it
[2567.36 --> 2572.72]  holds if the if the dying holds up over time i have no idea if our prints are going to hold up over

[3085.04 --> 3091.36]  actually got a different tech support challenge and the reason is that their bracket for holding their gpus
[3091.36 --> 3098.00]  in during shipping is so good that we could not unseat the gpu i mean that's kind of cool which
[3098.00 --> 3103.12]  is almost a win by default which is great because that's the only kind of win that dell who by the
[3103.12 --> 3110.16]  way did i mention is the laptop partner for the wanshow that's the yeah sorry that's the only kind

[3235.60 --> 3240.88]  them all so far company towns are back on the menu and i'm saying again because i think last time we were
[3240.88 --> 3246.80]  talking about amazon or something and now it's spacex because of course it is they both have to
[3246.80 --> 3254.00]  compete with each other on everything but this company town is on mars no no okay sorry texas carry
[3254.00 --> 3260.08]  on uh yes okay just about as well that's kind of another planet in some ways yeah uh because of the
[3260.08 --> 3266.80]  size cameron county in texas had a vote to incorporate a new town for spacex employees the vote was
[3266.80 --> 3275.60]  overwhelmingly approved with 283 votes four and only six against the city is about 1.5 square miles
[3276.96 --> 3282.96]  and has just under 500 people who live there 300 adults 120 children bobby pedan uh vice president
[3282.96 --> 3292.32]  at spacex was elected mayor he ran unopposed several bills are also working its way through texas state
[3292.32 --> 3298.16]  which will give the city the ability to close highways and beaches during rocket launches or other
[3298.16 --> 3308.24]  company activity wow cool uh from both a company and employee perspective can you list pros and cons of
[3308.24 --> 3314.96]  a company town um if if you knew all employees were on board would you think it's worth the effort
[3314.96 --> 3319.52]  to establish an lmg town how does this keep being a conversation
[3321.92 --> 3327.12]  if i knew everyone was on board would i be oh would i think it's worth the effort no i would
[3327.12 --> 3332.32]  not think it's we don't operate at that kind of scale that is line of speech for yes that is not
[3332.32 --> 3339.52]  he was fully convinced that every single person was on board and that he could buy more real estate in bc
[3339.52 --> 3347.36]  would we have our own brand of cheese wine is cheese it would melt the best on burgers who is
[3347.36 --> 3353.92]  responsible for that getting posted publicly that was for internal consumption only wait what was you
[3353.92 --> 3361.52]  don't know about this no okay so uh you remember in the when show teams group chat which he doesn't read
[3361.52 --> 3367.76]  which what do you mean oh that's right luke doesn't read it yes i saw the picture of your cheese okay
[3367.76 --> 3373.60]  okay so yes i do read it in the when i just don't read it necessarily when you post like right before
[3373.60 --> 3382.24]  a wad show and change the whole plan um on the weekend i posted uh i posted a picture of my grill
[3382.24 --> 3388.40]  with a bunch of patties on it uh that i had just put cheese slices on um
[3390.00 --> 3396.24]  and then i was like melt cheese on a burger challenge begun or something like that because of the
[3396.24 --> 3403.44]  conversation we had on when show recently where i evidently do not understand how cheese melts and
[3403.44 --> 3410.40]  i'm not capable of melting cheese on a burger then i posted shortly afterward all the cheese melted
[3410.40 --> 3414.80]  deliciously on top of the patties prove that he's the best at melting cheese on burgers no i did
[3414.80 --> 3427.12]  oh my god oh i swear your contribution and your contribution is a huge part of why i was not able to get my
[3427.12 --> 3428.80]  point across in that whole thing
[3431.20 --> 3440.00]  so i posted a bunch of patties with non-american cheese melted on them just normal kirkland cheddar and
[3440.00 --> 3446.40]  then i posted like a you're a wizard harry gif okay it was intended for internal consumption
[3446.96 --> 3455.12]  it was a joke and then sammy got a hold of it somehow and he's in that chat oh yeah why is he in
[3455.12 --> 3461.20]  that chat the wan chat yeah why would he be in the wan chat he tracks when it's gonna go live it's like a
[3461.20 --> 3469.92]  notable part of his job oh also like as far as i can tell like a third of the company is in that chat
[3469.92 --> 3475.28]  at this point anyway yeah there's so many people that need to be informed about when the time that
[3475.28 --> 3482.16]  wan is starting it's less critical now than it used to be but anyway i'm just gonna call you so now it's
[3482.16 --> 3487.60]  front page on the ltt subreddit i was not trying to poke this bear
[3490.48 --> 3496.00]  it wasn't me it wasn't you i don't believe you i requested can i post this you don't respond but
[3496.00 --> 3500.80]  someone else posted it i don't i'm not in the order though wait look who it's posted by that's in the
[3500.80 --> 3506.56]  from the chat that's not me that's from the chat no look no no no no no the reddit wait
[3506.56 --> 3520.08]  chewy posted this yeah he put i'm sorry chewy what wait i'm here i'm sorry that i'm sorry that sammy's
[3520.08 --> 3527.44]  bad influence i'm sorry sammy's bad influence turned you into such a bad egg because i thought
[3527.44 --> 3534.00]  that sammy had posted it and it got picked up on the subreddit i didn't know chewy just like oh my god
[3534.00 --> 3538.88]  okay all right chewy up whatever your name is sammy you're off the hook whatever your name is
[3538.88 --> 3545.84]  this is just the episode where all the employees lose their mind did he actually leave yeah he
[3545.84 --> 3552.72]  screamed and then slammed the door i mean it is 6 30. oh that makes sense oh my god a chewy really you
[3552.72 --> 3561.44]  were the you were supposed to be the chosen one oh anyway i think it was good the burgers were
[3561.44 --> 3568.40]  delicious and not american cheese definitely melts on a burger patty which is all i ever said
[3570.08 --> 3579.76]  seriously dude have you seen some of the comments on this no it's crazy i i find it so hard to care
[3580.96 --> 3587.68]  about about your comments on cheese and i don't even mean because like i i don't care what you have to
[3587.68 --> 3592.64]  say it's just like man it's the same argument made the other day of like when people were uproared
[3592.64 --> 3598.16]  about the placebo thing it's like why are you why are you here for that why are you here for medical
[3598.16 --> 3608.00]  stuff why are you here for cheese opinions like really wow you need other things to do dude it's been
[3608.00 --> 3616.40]  my goodness it's been wild the way people care about it um anyway so if you like american cheese tell you
[3616.40 --> 3618.72]  what eat american cheese
[3623.44 --> 3632.80]  nice nice congrats um enjoy it okay what were we talking about company towns oh lord um no i i know it
[3632.80 --> 3638.40]  would not be worth the effort to establish an lmg town like a we're not at nearly the scale where it
[3638.40 --> 3646.96]  would make any sense for the number of people that would need to live in it and b um like our operations
[3646.96 --> 3654.56]  do not in any way require a company town which could only have downsides compared to just living in an
[3654.56 --> 3660.32]  urban center that has like amenities and stuff but what if you could shut down all of the streets to roll
[3660.32 --> 3667.28]  around in your fire truck your customized fire truck with the lights uncovered because you just make
[3667.28 --> 3667.76]  the laws
[3671.12 --> 3678.96]  no no no there are upsides i'm sure there are upsides and it's not like when a ghost town goes up for sale
[3678.96 --> 3680.88]  i don't see that in my news feed and go
[3683.44 --> 3688.24]  but if the company was big enough and if every single person was on board every single person
[3688.24 --> 3692.88]  wouldn't be on board people have lives they might they have families they might go to school and
[3692.88 --> 3698.48]  what if the schools were were better and what if their housing was more affordable why would it be
[3698.48 --> 3704.24]  more because of course it would be why because trust me bro no oh my god um so yeah i guess if
[3704.24 --> 3710.48]  you're asking what the downsides are of a company town that's exactly it is the deal is better only
[3710.48 --> 3716.64]  until the company that owns the town decides it like shouldn't be better and like man is that ever
[3716.64 --> 3722.80]  a lot of eggs to have on one basket like i remember probably the wisest thing that the owner of ncix ever
[3722.80 --> 3727.76]  said to me was on the day that i quit and he like kind of tried to negotiate and keep me on board and
[3727.76 --> 3734.16]  i went no i've decided to move on and he kind of went okay um and i kind of went oh well that like
[3734.16 --> 3739.52]  you know your demeanor your your your your your tact here changed really suddenly he goes well look
[3739.52 --> 3746.40]  i mean nobody works at one company forever so like let's figure it now that we're at that point
[3746.40 --> 3752.88]  now let's figure it out now the next steps yeah yeah and i was like that that is experience that's
[3752.88 --> 3760.88]  wisdom right there and uh that is why it wouldn't have been good for me to live in the ncix town because
[3761.44 --> 3766.40]  now but maybe your life would have been so much better instead of just my livelihood like instead of just
[3766.40 --> 3772.16]  my stay there my paycheck no longer being at the company now all of a sudden impacts where i live
[3772.16 --> 3778.24]  it impacts where my children live potentially a dude i i mean and i guess technically you could
[3778.24 --> 3782.40]  live in that company town if you don't work there maybe i mean the children clearly don't work there
[3783.44 --> 3787.68]  i mean i don't know with what they're trying to do with labor laws and they're not allowed to leave
[3787.68 --> 3795.20]  uh well you know if you don't work there that's a good way to make sure that the funding for the
[3795.20 --> 3801.52]  the necessities of life yeah stay in the town and the specifically regimented education system
[3801.52 --> 3807.60]  doesn't get like you can have a modulated airport where they fly up in the air and then like go
[3808.24 --> 3813.04]  around and they like look at vancouver or look at some other destination then just come back this is
[3813.04 --> 3818.72]  where all the heathens live yeah you just look at them from up above you spit on them from the float
[3818.72 --> 3826.00]  plane yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah why are you looking this is hilarious
[3828.40 --> 3831.92]  this is apparently gordon ramsay struggling to melt cheese
[3833.28 --> 3835.92]  and someone saying it's okay to admit defeat about the cheese
[3839.60 --> 3844.72]  so you're better than gordon ramsay now nope yeah all i said was all i said was
[3844.72 --> 3849.92]  the only thing i ever said
[3851.36 --> 3860.40]  was that melting cheese on a burger ain't that hard that's all i said that's all i said
[3863.36 --> 3871.84]  and i got receipts now so whatever uh okay uh yeah company town topic gone okay you want to pick
[3871.84 --> 3878.40]  another one or what are we supposed to be doing what even is this show uh yeah give me a second
[3880.24 --> 3887.52]  the tino scent guy says this has been a topic for like three shows yeah because people leave a
[3887.52 --> 3892.72]  load i man the stuff people care about i will never understand i blame chewy speaking of things to care
[3892.72 --> 3898.32]  about gta 6 for being a bad influence on him has been delayed oh yeah gta 6 you watch the trailer of
[3898.32 --> 3903.76]  course you watch the trailer what do you think of the trailer no what you've got to be kidding even
[3903.76 --> 3909.52]  i watched the trailer i mean i read the comments but i think it's for me no i i actually i watched
[3910.72 --> 3918.48]  no i watched the trailer i watched the trailer the the thing for me is is that 95 million views oh dude
[3918.48 --> 3925.28]  dude dude this thing is popping off i don't i don't know if there's ever been more hype for a game
[3925.28 --> 3930.64]  ever what is gta 6 like too mainstream for you you're too cool for it is that is that what we're
[3930.64 --> 3934.40]  witnessing no because i feel like that's what we're witnessing i'm excited to play it why are you not
[3934.40 --> 3940.24]  one of those 96 million people because it's probably going to be like two or three years before it's on pc
[3941.36 --> 3946.96]  and i'm not getting a console just you i was gonna say bought but what you really did was borrow it from
[3946.96 --> 3953.60]  work you got a playstation 4 pro once to play a specific game yes okay so you wouldn't do that for gta
[3953.60 --> 3960.40]  i don't think so really why not gt what was the other game i forget horizon oh and okay zero dawn
[3960.40 --> 3968.88]  horizon yes zero dawn at the time horizon was not coming to pc whereas gta 6 will be coming to pc
[3968.88 --> 3975.84]  just a question of when so i'll just wait i did the same thing with uh gta 5 just waited
[3975.84 --> 3985.04]  so this trailer is not for me i see and that's okay i see okay i mean but you can't just enjoy the
[3985.04 --> 3990.08]  jiggle physics same as everybody else i heard they're a thing but no i don't don't forget that
[3990.08 --> 3995.20]  i've heard it's actually like and i haven't actually looked at the trailer it's even just as like a tech
[3995.20 --> 4000.32]  demo for what it's pretty stunning for what's possible rendered real time on what is like
[4000.32 --> 4007.60]  five functionally like a 6 000 series radeon card or whatever damn i've heard that's pretty cool
[4007.60 --> 4013.36]  i heard that like today though i'm sorry no like 5 000 series it's like a 5700 xt or something like
[4013.36 --> 4021.68]  that i think like huh damn it looks real good bro yeah it looks real good yeah i'll very likely watch
[4021.68 --> 4027.12]  it just for that because people mention like i okay a new trailer came out whatever i'm not gonna play
[4027.12 --> 4032.24]  this game for two three years what do i care um but then people are commenting specifically the
[4032.24 --> 4036.88]  bubbles is the main comment that i saw in the beer yeah yeah apparently that's like amazing beer physics
[4036.88 --> 4041.60]  yeah which is pretty wild yeah so like that's cool i'll watch it from like a interested in tech
[4041.60 --> 4048.32]  perspective i mean it is one of those things where i feel like we see this time and time again where the
[4048.32 --> 4055.12]  trailer prominently features the main character or characters and when you're like walking around in the
[4055.12 --> 4062.96]  world everything else still looks like a video game um but with that said like there's i saw this
[4062.96 --> 4069.52]  thread from um from a uh uh a graphics artist who was our video game artist that was basically just
[4069.52 --> 4074.48]  like here's a bunch of stuff that like people might not have like realized is is so cool about this and
[4074.48 --> 4080.32]  it's just i i don't have the link on me right now but if you just like kind of google that maybe i'll
[4080.32 --> 4084.96]  look at that or dude there's so many little details um like they have like raccoons rummaging
[4084.96 --> 4092.56]  in trash bins just like to make the world feel alive it's i didn't think it would be possible for
[4092.56 --> 4097.92]  me to look at the trailer and be like yeah that's why they spent 10 years on this but i looked at the
[4097.92 --> 4105.04]  trailer and i went oh perfect that's why i was hoping this was gonna exist i will watch i will watch this
[4105.04 --> 4109.84]  this is what i will watch i will not watch the trailer i will watch this okay i mean you know
[4109.84 --> 4117.68]  what fair enough i'd say i'd say game trailers are a perfect example of a time when react content is
[4117.68 --> 4125.20]  100 ethical yeah 100 of the point because basically and the funny thing is we've actually been copyright
[4125.20 --> 4131.92]  struck on wan show for showing game trailers and like reacting to them live which i always thought was
[4131.92 --> 4138.24]  wild marketing materials like i think if we went to i think if we went to court on that one uh we're
[4138.24 --> 4143.28]  probably going to get off scot-free because it's pretty clear that what the impact is on the original
[4143.28 --> 4147.92]  content and it's pretty clear what the intended purpose of what we're doing and how transformative
[4147.92 --> 4153.60]  it is and you know whatever whatever um split scream in full plane chat said the that liquid bubble uh
[4154.16 --> 4158.40]  that liquid bubble in liquid tech is from half-life alex the dev made it public that's cool
[4158.40 --> 4166.48]  neat neat oh very cool anyway so yeah yeah sure fine fine watch the sure just watch the digital
[4166.48 --> 4170.72]  foundry thing just just watch it because it's super cool um and it really does look like kind of
[4170.72 --> 4175.68]  amazing even with crappy youtube compression all right what else we got
[4175.68 --> 4185.36]  oh you want sponsors uh we could do that should we do one more one more topic first we got yeah we got
[4185.36 --> 4194.88]  lost man ios dev responds to linus's mac os gripes oh a very blurry ios developer okay has responded to my
[4194.88 --> 4201.68]  mac os is great unless you try to use it as a desktop operating system segment on february 28th edition of
[4201.68 --> 4209.68]  wans show yeah oh that is very blurry is that a shot at our it's anonymous video no no it's anonymous
[4209.68 --> 4214.80]  reviews is the channel name okay yeah no that's intentional the youtuber anonymous reviews has been
[4214.80 --> 4220.64]  an ios developer for about 15 years says they're not a fanboy and uses windows for gaming and editing
[4220.64 --> 4225.52]  the video gets off to a bit of a rocky start excusing the poor multi-monitor behavior by saying it's better
[4225.52 --> 4232.64]  than it used to be and we get a detour later on teasing that i that i don't know about the control
[4232.64 --> 4242.72]  key all right i mean you know what i think that's a criticism that you're gonna see from any power user
[4242.72 --> 4251.04]  on any platform of anyone coming in going i can't do yeah x you know right and it's like well i can open
[4251.04 --> 4257.60]  up linkedin if i put in an incantation i can cut if i combine that x with my control
[4258.48 --> 4266.96]  or command or whatever right yeah um and hotkeys really are the answer to something being not crappy
[4266.96 --> 4273.12]  um like truly though not just like in a in a gatekeeper-y get good scrub kind of like awful
[4273.12 --> 4277.76]  sort of way uh but they they really can be the answer in a lot of ways anyway sorry carry on
[4277.76 --> 4283.44]  otherwise we get some interesting explanations of how and why apple does things uh too long didn't
[4284.88 --> 4288.56]  write uh w watch watch uh-huh
[4292.00 --> 4296.80]  some things are inconsistent and that's bad apple should take me up on my offer to consult for a week
[4296.80 --> 4302.48]  for free apple and the uh community should be more open about outside input input if they want to
[4302.48 --> 4309.84]  improve the os and ecosystem uh discussion questions did did things get better for you as you used mac os
[4312.00 --> 4317.44]  um also a note that part two of our switching to apple in 2025 should be out next month yeah things
[4317.44 --> 4327.52]  did get better absolutely um i'd say the first like the first hour my inf infuriated level was here
[4327.52 --> 4337.44]  by the third day it was here and then by like you know the end of the month you know it was like kind
[4337.44 --> 4343.68]  of down here did you have much of this like did i oh like did i kind of come up against challenges that
[4343.68 --> 4349.12]  sort of raised the theory for yeah yeah definitely i remembered a couple things like not first day where
[4349.12 --> 4353.44]  you were like genuinely yelling in your office about it but i think you were also filming clips so yeah
[4353.44 --> 4360.16]  but like the thing is and and i feel like oh i don't know man i i've been doing this so long
[4361.12 --> 4367.12]  that i've kind of had a take on anything that will annoy someone about something oh and i think that's
[4367.12 --> 4377.28]  i think it's really challenging because um i i think i end up kind of getting misunderstood a lot
[4377.28 --> 4386.08]  because when i criticize mac os i am not saying that if you like hot dogs you're basically a big
[4386.08 --> 4390.08]  idiot if a million people hear you say anything it's going to be misunderstood by some amount of
[4390.08 --> 4395.84]  them i'm just saying that this is something that hamburgers do better that's what i'm saying and i'm
[4395.84 --> 4401.84]  not saying the other thing i'm only saying the thing that i'm saying and so i i feel like and and
[4401.84 --> 4407.28]  it's it's really interesting and you can see these kind of these silos of viewership that exist where
[4407.28 --> 4413.04]  the people who watch only our ios stuff or only our you know uh apple stuff will have a certain
[4413.04 --> 4417.28]  perception of me and the people who watch only our linux stuff will have a certain perception of me
[4417.84 --> 4421.44]  and people who watch only our windows stuff will have a certain perception of me like these flyby
[4421.44 --> 4425.84]  viewers that only watch occasional content when it kind of peaks their interest huge percentage of
[4425.84 --> 4431.76]  right so so so anyone who's listening to me kind of rant about mac os because they only tune in
[4431.76 --> 4436.08]  whenever i'm going to talk about mac os is going to have this perception that i like hate mac os
[4436.08 --> 4444.72]  but the reality of it is i have entire videos griping about how things are in windows and like there's a
[4444.72 --> 4453.04]  lot of gripes and unintuitive design or inconsistent design is the word that i'm using synonymously with
[4453.04 --> 4459.52]  unintuitive here because something that is inconsistent is inherently unintuitive inconsistent
[4459.52 --> 4465.28]  design is something that exists across all of these platforms and that we as users should demand
[4465.28 --> 4472.24]  be reduced um and so where i get where i think i end up getting sort of adversarial with the community
[4472.24 --> 4478.88]  sometimes is when people take the position that it's perfect the way it is and anyone who doesn't
[4478.88 --> 4484.96]  agree is just a hater and so that's where and i tend to find those people in the apple and linux
[4484.96 --> 4491.44]  communities more than i do in windows because the windows community is almost in a way more like humble
[4491.44 --> 4497.36]  if that makes sense we all know windows a lot of self-hatred going we all kind of hate it but we accept
[4497.36 --> 4504.16]  it because all the applications we want all the games we want to play they just run it so whatever it is
[4504.16 --> 4508.64]  what it is and there's pockets of the apple community in particular that are like that they
[4508.64 --> 4515.92]  just accept it because it's like well i need final cut and i kind of acknowledge that this is a very
[4515.92 --> 4521.04]  imperfect system for it but i need final cut so i guess it just is the way it is if you had no idea
[4521.04 --> 4527.28]  what an operating system even was sure and you had generalized sentiment from each community i think you
[4527.28 --> 4532.88]  would think that windows was the least popular operating system yeah i think you could easily come away with
[4532.88 --> 4542.24]  that conclusion um i think you would think like apple is for everyone linux stuff is for nerds and techies
[4542.24 --> 4548.48]  and nobody uses windows yeah i i know i i don't even i don't even think that's like uh i don't even think
[4548.48 --> 4552.80]  that's like a crazy take i i yeah i think that's probably what you'd come away with but the reality
[4552.80 --> 4561.12]  of it is that windows has the lion's lion's share of the market um so i i don't know man i i forget where i
[4561.12 --> 4568.96]  was even going with this right so yeah yeah my my my anger level absolutely went down over time
[4570.56 --> 4576.80]  but there were definitely things that are just wrong that are just incorrect in apple's implementation
[4577.52 --> 4584.88]  and that should be fixed and i think that as users we should demand better and the whole the whole
[4584.88 --> 4590.00]  pushback that i get sometimes that's just like well you just criticize everything why don't you just
[4590.00 --> 4599.36]  enjoy it it's like well like that but but but but it could be better like if it if it wasn't like
[4599.36 --> 4603.76]  this it would be better and that would be good is that is that not something we should strive for so
[4603.76 --> 4609.20]  then why even why even listen to me at all that's like my whole job it's like here's something that's
[4609.20 --> 4613.84]  good about it that's fair here's something that's not good about it because like across the course of a
[4613.84 --> 4621.44]  video uh i'm sure you praised mac os in that video at some point on the land show yeah i'm pretty sure
[4621.44 --> 4629.68]  i did because that that's i think what we're talking about oh not the video uh yeah my show it was the
[4629.68 --> 4635.52]  segment of on the february 28th land show okay sure but like part one of switching to apple in 2025 came out
[4636.56 --> 4641.84]  uh yeah but he wasn't really responding to that okay yeah it was the band show segment um i don't know how
[4641.84 --> 4647.20]  much we were still on the original topic to be clear yeah i don't know anyway but either way i
[4647.20 --> 4651.84]  don't think it's fair to say that you complained about everything well no i of course not but that's
[4651.84 --> 4656.40]  the thing is when people have an emotional connection to it that's what they hear slap a label on yeah
[4656.40 --> 4660.96]  that's what they hear yeah and and so it's just like it's one of those things where i feel like this
[4660.96 --> 4668.00]  is part of why as uh as a media personality it's really hard to survive over a very extended period of
[4668.00 --> 4675.20]  time if you have anything more nuanced than a yes this no that take because it's really hard for
[4675.20 --> 4681.60]  people to be aligned with everything is shades of gray when they get when when these when these issues
[4681.60 --> 4689.36]  are so emotional for people and i under and i've i've kind of come around over the years to why these
[4689.36 --> 4696.72]  issues are so emotional to people and it's because we invest in them we are literally invested
[4696.72 --> 4705.84]  in them we put we put our money down and we go i am team pixel you know we we put our we put our
[4705.84 --> 4710.56]  money in that was like mean and our money oh i've got a dbrand case on it doesn't matter poor phone
[4710.56 --> 4718.08]  yeah well whatever it doesn't feel anything um and to be clear i am not team pixel i actually had a
[4718.08 --> 4722.24]  really funny interaction yeah why are you using a pixel what's going on david today well because i was
[4722.24 --> 4728.40]  using that nothing phone the 3a pro and i was just having like a bunch of just weird annoying bugs
[4728.40 --> 4733.52]  with it like when i'd get out of my car it would it would keep playing on my like my music from my car
[4733.52 --> 4738.00]  would like play on my phone for a little bit and then it would like nod and then uh so i was just
[4738.00 --> 4743.12]  like ah man and there's a ah there was something else oh yeah it was really hard to get in and out of
[4743.12 --> 4748.16]  my pocket which was kind of annoying because that like giant camera bump on it there were there were a
[4748.16 --> 4752.56]  handful of things and so i was like okay screw it you know it's a couple hundred dollars more i'm
[4752.56 --> 4757.76]  gonna get the pixel 9a i love i went the complete opposite direction it has like almost no camera
[4757.76 --> 4764.32]  bump which is really rare these days and dude i've had so many annoying issues with this thing and i was
[4764.32 --> 4769.60]  i was actually standing talking to david in uh in the writing room today just about something
[4769.60 --> 4774.08]  unrelated i got on the topic somehow of how like everyone's like yeah just you haven't experienced
[4774.08 --> 4777.92]  android until you've experienced the pixel just get a pixel you'll love it and i was like
[4777.92 --> 4781.44]  i've had a really hard time with the pixel i pull it out of my pocket and one of the issues
[4781.44 --> 4787.12]  that i've had with it which is that the um the ambient light sensor just sucks on this thing
[4787.12 --> 4791.52]  happened i was like look how dim this is and then i was trying to pull down you know how you have to
[4791.52 --> 4797.28]  pull down your shade like a second time to get your brightness and stuff because they did away with
[4797.28 --> 4802.08]  swipe and or just bring it all the way down it brings down the whole thing like it freaking used to
[4802.08 --> 4807.12]  which was way better anyway so i went i tried to swipe it down the second time i tried like
[4807.12 --> 4811.52]  six times and it wouldn't do it you know and no no my oh dude that drives me crazy
[4812.16 --> 4815.60]  anytime i'm on speakerphone with this thing i try to interact with the phone it's like
[4815.60 --> 4820.48]  that no screen goes away i try tonight because i'm a multitasker right so i'll go to pull down
[4820.48 --> 4825.04]  my notification shade while i'm on a call it's such a pixel problem and it'll be like oh do you want
[4825.04 --> 4829.92]  the screen to turn no i don't i just want to interact with my phone so i have to like i have to like
[4829.92 --> 4836.00]  ninja in there from an angle where it can't see me coming um oh i literally cannot classic
[4836.00 --> 4841.28]  pixel i cannot access my plex server from this phone oh um i don't know if that's because of plex's
[4842.00 --> 4851.60]  dog new app which is also super slow on my ios so i i literally use my iphone that that i was using
[4851.60 --> 4857.44]  for the challenge i am still using it every day for my earphones when i go to sleep because i can't
[4857.44 --> 4862.16]  access my plex server from this phone for whatever reason that's weird again that could be plex uh
[4862.16 --> 4866.96]  man what are the other issues i'm having with i'm expecting that's complex but i don't know uh it's
[4866.96 --> 4875.52]  it's probably plex oh dude my keyboard constantly doesn't come up like constantly doesn't come up
[4875.52 --> 4882.48]  and uh i use um i use swift key so my my voice input button will just like randomly not work in
[4882.48 --> 4888.24]  especially in certain apps like i can almost never use uh voice to type with you in discord
[4888.24 --> 4893.44]  oh it's working right now look at that okay well whatever it often doesn't work weird like i'll go
[4893.44 --> 4897.84]  voice to type and then it'll just be blank down here um that could be a swift key issue that could
[4897.84 --> 4901.60]  be an android issue either way it's not an issue that i had with my samsung phone before and it's
[4901.60 --> 4905.84]  not an issue that i had on that um nothing phone that i was using slightly before this so
[4905.84 --> 4913.20]  i um and i it still drives me absolutely crazy that i can't swap the navigation buttons i have
[4913.20 --> 4919.76]  reached out to the pixel team and um i don't i don't want to i don't want to update you guys until
[4919.76 --> 4925.84]  i have a final final answer but what i will say is i'm extremely unsatisfied with their response so far
[4926.64 --> 4933.68]  um i've got to jump in here i've got an update from arty oh yeah he spoke to the mythical powers behind
[4933.68 --> 4939.44]  pricing and um excellent i am actually very interested to hear this maybe i'll give you the
[4939.44 --> 4943.84]  the real technical explanation it appears the global pricing on the mystery screwdriver was
[4943.84 --> 4951.12]  incorrectly priced at 49.99 the conversion was not applied correctly and this has unfortunately been
[4951.12 --> 4959.04]  fixed so if you got one for 50 bucks good on you otherwise it's now 69.99 okay um that makes more
[4959.04 --> 4967.12]  sense sorry so i think linus is happy if you guys were ever wondering um oh no what it looks like
[4967.12 --> 4974.24]  when i am legitimately perturbed about a price on the site versus when i'm you know we're doing an
[4974.24 --> 4980.08]  aggressive sale being an actor and i am i am a little bit stressed out but i'm hamming it up a little
[4980.08 --> 4988.80]  bit that was the difference serious linus is a very terrifying person oh come on but it's also
[4988.80 --> 4994.72]  uh extremely useful you can't use the word terrifying like that and then not explain okay
[4995.76 --> 4999.92]  okay yeah that's fine sometimes it's very difficult to you he will explain now that he is terrified
[5001.28 --> 5009.20]  hey i'm sorry uh yeah you know he riffs he riffs he gets angry he gets mean and it's not real and then
[5009.20 --> 5016.40]  you know hey i need you to do this thing and i'm being extremely direct what please do the please do the
[5016.40 --> 5021.60]  thing do i get mean do i what no no no it's not mean when have i ever done that it's just
[5023.36 --> 5031.04]  direct what's going on no no okay okay no no no i want i wanna okay okay now now hold on a second
[5031.60 --> 5035.68]  i think i know what we're talking about are we talking about the time that i explicitly said
[5035.68 --> 5041.20]  not to do a thing no no no that's very different okay no this isn't necessarily anything that you've
[5041.20 --> 5048.08]  done to me this is like well well documented it is yeah like what no no i i would i would like to
[5048.08 --> 5055.12]  know oh maybe maybe you haven't seen the videos because it's like a behind the teams thing oh oh
[5055.12 --> 5059.92]  is this the what do you think about your boss stuff might be but i've seen it he's never gonna watch
[5059.92 --> 5065.84]  those no no i said i wouldn't yeah i don't know it's stuff like that it's completely fine but yeah
[5065.84 --> 5072.72]  mean not mean who have i well you said mean oh no no no no no mean mean is the the the playful version
[5074.48 --> 5082.40]  oh that was super unclear oh i'm so sorry no linus is never ever mean like ever okay now they're
[5082.40 --> 5084.72]  not gonna believe you now it's too far okay
[5087.52 --> 5095.68]  oh i think you just misheard mean no i really don't think i did chat uh can can you help me out
[5095.68 --> 5105.04]  here chat because oh no oh oh boy they say they understood it for the most part yeah yeah yeah
[5105.04 --> 5113.68]  so uh are they just covering for you i don't think so okay i hope that uh okay dan started by saying
[5113.68 --> 5120.00]  linus is mean when he's playing it up as a joke okay yeah i thought you meant it's mean when i like
[5120.00 --> 5125.76]  like act like things are a joke i did too i also misunderstood no no okay see the vast majority of
[5125.76 --> 5135.20]  chats i've been defending you the whole time the whole time okay geez anyway so yeah that's that's
[5135.20 --> 5139.60]  what i look i'm not talking again that's what no no no no we like it because he was too mean
[5139.60 --> 5150.64]  oh was he was he too mean no oh shut up okay there there was a time when i was very direct with dan
[5151.44 --> 5162.00]  yeah and then that's it's very very useful okay useful's a word i think it's important um yeah okay
[5162.00 --> 5170.56]  all right but i i would i look i would like to think that i'm not mean but what i discovered what
[5170.56 --> 5176.72]  i discovered this week is uh horoscopes for mba's thing recently so he got his color blocks oh did he
[5176.72 --> 5181.20]  so that i think that's probably part of what he's like no no this communication is good because
[5182.56 --> 5187.44]  is that is that not it no no no no because we were literally talking about before the show how you like
[5187.44 --> 5192.40]  shorter and more direct communication yeah yeah yeah i just think it's it's interesting that you
[5192.40 --> 5198.24]  pointed out that that was an example of like actually no you need to go and make sure that
[5198.24 --> 5204.40]  this is accurate i'm not just oh my god it's so expensive you sold it for too cheap arty what are
[5204.40 --> 5209.12]  you doing you're bad at your job get out of my sight it was like no can you go and please check this
[5210.08 --> 5216.64]  and then they did okay it's different shoot my ad brain did a thing there and
[5216.64 --> 5222.56]  uh fine this show is awful i i'm sorry now you're calling my show awful thank you very much dan
[5223.12 --> 5229.84]  you're the producer of it so oh no it's my fault okay shoot i was gonna shoot i was gonna say
[5229.84 --> 5234.80]  something there for a second then i completely lost it all right well good luck everybody uh yes
[5234.80 --> 5244.80]  luke's phone just just rang he's got places to be and chicken to cook um so anyway yes that was that
[5244.80 --> 5250.88]  that was a that was a situation where um i actually did was not consulted on the pricing and it really
[5250.88 --> 5258.40]  did seem very wrong um oh right i remember so i'd like to think that i'm not mean or at least that's
[5258.40 --> 5265.20]  what i used to think but i actually filmed the float plane exclusive earlier this week where uh sammy
[5265.20 --> 5272.96]  had me reacting to employees here talking about their first interaction with me
[5275.92 --> 5280.88]  so here's the who the is the ambassador so here's the thing that was hilarious he's definitely not
[5280.88 --> 5285.76]  mean he's not mean he's never he's definitely he's never been mean in a professional context so here's
[5285.76 --> 5293.52]  the thing watch any of the wan shows that we have ever done and you're very mean so here's the thing
[5293.52 --> 5299.84]  here's the thing luke every one of those interactions at least the ones that i can remember or remember
[5299.84 --> 5308.16]  some version of there's a whole bunch of context in my brain that makes whatever i said a light-hearted
[5308.16 --> 5318.24]  joke or banter you're hearing them recall what they were thinking on their side i was like oh
[5319.20 --> 5326.00]  i may need to alter my approach i think i think sometimes you don't fully grasp the
[5327.20 --> 5332.96]  when it's like a new person at the company and you are owner guy can you imagine this is like a
[5332.96 --> 5337.68]  flatter structure and like they don't they don't know but the people have been here forever taking full
[5337.68 --> 5342.24]  weight which is the context that i have they don't give a like they just
[5343.52 --> 5350.32]  you gotta consider it's a new person i look so so i don't know seddon's was hilarious uh emily
[5350.32 --> 5356.88]  seddon from editing seddon's was hilarious because she she she goes on this whole long thing talking
[5356.88 --> 5363.92]  about how like it's her first day and it's like her trial day and like the ceo of the company comes
[5363.92 --> 5371.36]  by and is like who are you it's kind of she's like i'm here for my trial day lululu um and apparently
[5371.36 --> 5380.56]  i was like oh good luck and then i left that seems fine yeah but you know me she doesn't wait but like
[5380.56 --> 5388.88]  what were you supposed to do maybe i'm not good i i'm i've the way she tells the story was very
[5388.88 --> 5395.76]  perspective broadening for me just like i don't know it almost oh it almost seems like uh maybe
[5395.76 --> 5400.96]  i'm a horrible person maybe you are what were you supposed to do i don't know not talk to her at all
[5400.96 --> 5405.04]  like that's the thing is like that's my natural thing to just be like oh who are you or you know
[5405.68 --> 5411.44]  oh man i'm here on trial okay good luck and then andrew i apparently asked i'm in trouble on no less
[5411.44 --> 5418.72]  than three separate occasions if he was going to introduce himself andrew moore from shooting
[5418.72 --> 5424.24]  department he asked on i asked him on three separate occasions if he was going to introduce himself
[5424.24 --> 5437.52]  because i had forgotten him oh that one's that one's a little rough and then and then vance our
[5437.52 --> 5443.76]  executive assistant um who was hired for to be a general executive assistant but was like mostly
[5443.76 --> 5448.96]  assigned to me at the beginning especially he does other stuff uh-huh what are you talking about he
[5448.96 --> 5455.04]  follows you around well sometimes all the time do you have his task list because i do it has lots of
[5455.04 --> 5459.04]  things that are not for me i wonder why only you have it what no i'm not the only one who has it
[5459.04 --> 5464.08]  colton's his manager okay you're actually being unhelpful right now he is not exclusively my ea
[5464.08 --> 5469.76]  i know for a long time it was kind of that way this now it's not yeah anyway so it's been kind of
[5469.76 --> 5475.04]  sometimes one sometimes the other anyway at the beginning he was mostly assigned to me and his
[5475.04 --> 5480.32]  first assignment basically was to just like kind of shadow me and you know i don't know see if there's
[5480.32 --> 5484.88]  a way ways we can find more efficiencies or ways that he can like kind of help me optimize my time
[5484.88 --> 5491.20]  better you know whatever else and apparently um after some amount of time of him kind of sitting in my
[5491.20 --> 5495.44]  office like you know i don't know helping take notes for calls i'm not 100 sure what he was doing
[5495.44 --> 5502.08]  it was like his first couple days or something apparently i just kind of like turned to him
[5502.08 --> 5509.28]  after like some kind of period of awkward silence and i'm like so am i supposed to like talk to you or
[5510.64 --> 5518.96]  okay so wait wait stop stop so in my mind so in my mind maybe i'm doing fine i've never had an ea before
[5518.96 --> 5529.68]  i don't know how this works i literally don't 100 know what your job is because i like didn't hire you
[5529.68 --> 5537.28]  and i i didn't really define the role um i i feel kind of awkward just like having a person in my office
[5537.28 --> 5543.12]  while i'm working am i supposed to like banter so i so i tried to turn it into like a light-hearted joke
[5543.12 --> 5552.56]  didn't didn't land yep didn't land at all um i mean clearly clearly he made it uh he's still here
[5552.56 --> 5558.56]  so you know been a couple years now i think um so that's something and uh yeah so there's a there's
[5558.56 --> 5566.56]  a bunch more lmg.gd floatplane it's a banger of an exclusive um so i may have to reevaluate a little bit
[5566.56 --> 5572.48]  i don't know i i don't think you will the reality of it is i am a very awkward person
[5573.60 --> 5580.24]  and a lot of people assume that youtubers tend to be extroverts but it is not i think most of them
[5580.24 --> 5586.00]  aren't necessarily the case i have certainly met ones that are oh yeah but what i have mostly met
[5586.00 --> 5594.48]  is introverts who who um i don't want to say fake it because
[5594.48 --> 5601.76]  most youtubers that i've met are super real like they're real it's just that what they have learned
[5601.76 --> 5610.16]  to do is channel their introversion and awkwardness into being very personable to a piece of glass
[5610.96 --> 5616.64]  um you you put them in front of a crowd though and it is it is the more oh dude it is the exception
[5616.64 --> 5622.32]  rather than the rule yeah that can like do crowd work and handle like public speaking and stuff like
[5622.32 --> 5627.52]  that like those are those are generally like the superstars um and even then even some of the
[5627.52 --> 5633.84]  superstars are not comfortable with it it's not it's not what they would prefer it just it happened
[5633.84 --> 5639.52]  by accident because they happened to be really really good at appealing to a piece of glass while
[5639.52 --> 5650.64]  they're alone in a room um yeah so i may just be an awkward introvert guy taren asked me if i wanted to
[5650.64 --> 5657.28]  have lunch with a rep from a company at computex or at dinner or something and i i literally i i i've
[5657.28 --> 5662.56]  told him before that i this is literally why i hired you so that i don't have to talk to people
[5663.12 --> 5674.08]  at some point do you think it's funny do you like making awkward scenarios um it's i mean i tell this to
[5674.08 --> 5680.48]  my kids all the time and it's it's really like it's something i generally generally genuinely believe
[5681.12 --> 5686.96]  a joke is funny as long as everyone's laughing and if the other person is like genuinely deeply
[5686.96 --> 5694.32]  uncomfortable then no it's not funny right but but it is it is funny that i could go this long and not
[5694.32 --> 5702.72]  realize it that's funny like that's a funny thing it's a funny observation um it's it's funny that someone
[5702.72 --> 5708.40]  can make a career out of i don't it's ironic that someone can make a career out of somehow having
[5708.40 --> 5712.96]  their personality be appealing to millions of people online i don't think this is fair i don't
[5712.96 --> 5717.60]  think this line of thinking is fair and yet be like i don't think this line of thing is fair at all
[5717.60 --> 5720.88]  and yet be catastrophically awkward in person you're trying to be like the opposite of this
[5721.52 --> 5728.24]  and it's not working you're not not charismatic i think you like no but in a comedic sense awkward
[5728.24 --> 5732.96]  scenarios and when other people like it as well dude you love it yes so you like going out of
[5732.96 --> 5736.88]  your way to create them because when the other person enjoys them you find it very fun i love
[5736.88 --> 5740.96]  not everyone receives that energy i love the office the same way i love faulty towers yeah
[5741.84 --> 5749.12]  but i i know i genuinely this doesn't mean that you are necessarily awkward you don't think so no it
[5749.12 --> 5753.92]  means that you like creating awkward scenarios because sometimes they're really funny oh that doesn't
[5753.92 --> 5758.40]  mean that you're oh i see what you're saying no no yes 100 no no yes yes yes but then you're saying
[5758.40 --> 5764.64]  that it's ironic that someone who is awkward was success but you're not but you haven't you haven't
[5764.64 --> 5770.16]  watched the video yet like no i'm i'm being i'm being real right now like creating these scenarios but i
[5770.16 --> 5775.76]  didn't know that they took it that way like i i genuinely there's no way you didn't know the vance
[5776.32 --> 5781.68]  have you watched it um am i supposed to talk to you there's no way i didn't know that the way i
[5781.68 --> 5787.12]  i don't believe you i thought it was i thought it was funny right because you like you find awkward
[5787.12 --> 5791.84]  situations funny well yeah but i i thought he'd be i thought he'd think it was funny too but that
[5791.84 --> 5796.72]  doesn't mean that you're awkward but that's the means that you thought it would be funny the
[5796.72 --> 5801.76]  awkward part is that i thought he would think it's funny right but you interact with people constantly
[5801.76 --> 5805.04]  and the fact that some of them are awkward interactions does not mean that you're an awkward
[5805.04 --> 5810.88]  person people don't tell me this because by the time people are able to have that conversation with me
[5810.88 --> 5816.40]  we've built a rapport and we're like i guess they're over it or whatever like said and i are
[5816.40 --> 5823.36]  good yeah vance and i are good yeah so this only came up because i'm watching this exclusive at a
[5823.36 --> 5828.16]  time when they're comfortable talking about it but they didn't bring it up to me at the time i didn't
[5828.16 --> 5833.04]  know that it was actually uncomfortable for them how would they have done that no one's going to do that
[5833.04 --> 5838.88]  i know maybe you not knowing that makes you awkward yes that's what i'm trying to say but you did
[5838.88 --> 5844.80]  know that you just said that i know that i know what that they're never going to bring that up
[5845.36 --> 5849.84]  well yeah yeah but you're gonna do it anyways and not because you're awkward you're gonna do it
[5849.84 --> 5854.40]  anyways because you think it might be funny well i'll do it if i think it's if i think they're also
[5854.40 --> 5857.44]  gonna think it's funny i just thought you're gonna think that they're gonna think it's funny
[5857.44 --> 5861.36]  every time because you don't know these people and you would prefer that they would think it's funny
[5861.36 --> 5864.48]  it's not that you're awkward i'm not gonna well that's pretty awkward
[5867.60 --> 5870.88]  hold on i'm trying to find a thing oh man um
[5873.68 --> 5880.48]  this feels reminiscent of the cheese combo i mean i can i can imagine what i would feel like if i didn't
[5880.48 --> 5887.68]  get linus's who the f is dan besser well yeah but there was so much actual real context around that
[5888.32 --> 5892.72]  right it wasn't just i'm in a room with him or anything like that the series of events that would
[5892.72 --> 5900.16]  have led him to just give me the master key with no context is hilarious but i have context around that
[5900.16 --> 5904.32]  not everyone necessarily has all the con that's what i was trying to say at the very beginning yeah
[5904.32 --> 5909.28]  yeah yeah yeah is that not everybody has the context that i have in my brain when i make an
[5909.28 --> 5914.96]  offhand remark like who the is daniel besser and so that was our first conversation so what i realized
[5915.68 --> 5922.96]  watching this is that yes i intentionally create these awkward situations no i did not consider the
[5922.96 --> 5929.60]  lack of context that made it genuinely uncomfortable in some cases no i didn't you're fishing in a in a
[5929.60 --> 5933.44]  lake with a lot of different types of fish oh yeah and just because you catch the wrong one
[5933.44 --> 5939.92]  sometimes you're still going to keep casting uh i will i will try harder not to i mean i had um i
[5939.92 --> 5943.92]  we didn't talk about this on i talked to you about this after the party but not on we haven't talked
[5943.92 --> 5950.00]  about it on the show so i was at a party recently where i ended up in a very socially awkward situation
[5950.00 --> 5957.60]  with um someone who is a big fan of a particular figure in the tech space um oh yeah i remember this
[5957.60 --> 5963.60]  that was that was me completely misreading a situation ending up in a very awkward encounter
[5963.60 --> 5968.48]  that like turned heated on me in a way that i didn't anticipate i got very passionate and enthusiastic
[5968.48 --> 5978.16]  the way i'm apt to what um and no i will tell you that i ran into a situation uh it's either yesterday
[5978.16 --> 5986.00]  oh no i oh you were there for it i ran into a situation with a salesperson very recently with you
[5986.00 --> 5991.68]  where i was saying something critical about the thing that they were selling and they escalated
[5991.68 --> 5997.76]  extremely quickly yeah he knows what i'm talking about right now yeah yeah i i i was i believed you
[5997.76 --> 6005.84]  but it's taking me a second that was wild if i hadn't if i hadn't had the recent experience that i had
[6005.84 --> 6011.60]  arguing with someone whose convictions are clearly so strong about something that no amount of logic or
[6011.60 --> 6016.96]  reason or anything is going to change anything about it i may have continued engaging with that
[6016.96 --> 6022.16]  individual as much as it shouldn't have that played a non-insignificant role in the final decision to not
[6022.16 --> 6028.08]  oh that's interesting yeah um yeah that was that was like super weirdly aggressive when nothing was
[6028.08 --> 6032.48]  personal and i was just talking about the product that was for sale see but that's almost an argument
[6032.48 --> 6039.12]  against you being awkward no no i what i'm saying is i'm learning yeah but everybody i think honestly
[6039.12 --> 6044.40]  honestly if anything i think this revelation for you means that you're probably less awkward than
[6044.40 --> 6049.76]  the vast majority of people and more charismatic because you're only starting to realize this now
[6049.76 --> 6052.32]  corporate because i think right there no screw off
[6057.20 --> 6061.52]  because i think most people are more awkward way more often so they're aware of it
[6063.12 --> 6068.72]  oh man i don't know dude i don't think you saying that you're you're awkward is legitimate or would
[6068.72 --> 6075.36]  stand up well either way social i am definitely everyone has awkward moments i am learning
[6076.32 --> 6083.04]  there i will say that and ideally everyone is and that reaction video was eye-opening for me
[6083.04 --> 6089.04]  i will try to be more cognizant of the sorts of jokes that i make with people i am meeting for
[6089.04 --> 6097.52]  the very first time that is what i learned how i will i say lean into it i will it up sometimes lean into it
[6097.52 --> 6102.24]  let this be a known thing you start here your boss is going to say something incredibly offensive
[6102.24 --> 6106.80]  see but this i used to literally do it in interviews just this is my point this is not
[6106.80 --> 6112.00]  the first time you've learned this or just part of the company culture it's a form of hazing
[6112.00 --> 6116.24]  everyone is learning all the time but we are not that company anymore and we can't be no no no no
[6116.24 --> 6121.60]  we're too big now no i know but that's this is what i mean it's just another step well yeah yeah but
[6121.60 --> 6126.24]  everyone's learning all the time right and it was awkward when i did it in interviews and it's
[6126.24 --> 6132.80]  awkward when i do it on the first day and some someday maybe years from now i will figure out
[6132.80 --> 6140.80]  that it's awkward when i do it three months you're not awkward you're just unprofessional thanks dan

[6300.32 --> 6305.68]  logistics team he's hilarious oh it says chat about jamie's upgrade cool he's hilarious um he spent
[6305.68 --> 6313.60]  uh i'm not insignificant amount of his budget on model trains no really though like a not
[6313.60 --> 6320.64]  insignificant amount of his budget like like one little like mini thing is like 40 a hundred dollars
[6320.64 --> 6326.16]  like he bought this pack of little people little tiny people that was over a hundred dollars some of
[6326.16 --> 6329.84]  them i looked at the price i was like yo this crazy he's like that second hand i'm like what
[6330.48 --> 6338.24]  no dude model trains anyway uh jamie jamie is like he out like dry awkward humors me that that guy's
[6338.24 --> 6345.28]  hilarious anyway um there's a says light discussion on how to choose between the 9950x3d and the 99
[6345.28 --> 6352.72]  9800x3d i mean well that's that's pretty self-explanatory if gaming is your only focus 9800x3d or if you
[6352.72 --> 6359.60]  want that oh it's it's small but that very small extra little edge the 9950x3d does run a little bit
[6359.60 --> 6365.12]  faster but obviously costs quite a bit more so the main reason to step up to it is going to be
[6365.12 --> 6371.44]  if you really need the extra eight cores and oh this is cool now's your chance to win the ultimate
[6371.44 --> 6377.28]  gaming upgrade three lucky winners will take home some sweet prizes with the grand prize including an

[6390.48 --> 6397.52]  description alongside full t's and c's including regions where people are eligible okay luke get it
[6397.52 --> 6403.04]  over with so line or aj apparently pointed out that linus asked him to introduce himself like four times
[6403.04 --> 6410.64]  and also at the first ltx uh linus thought aj was a fan to be fair i think that was the first time you
[6410.64 --> 6416.16]  guys met each other so it kind of makes sense given the context of the situation because i don't think
[6416.16 --> 6426.72]  aj had one of the the shirts um and i will pair it with uh the awkwardness of me hiring aj to bring things
[6426.72 --> 6431.92]  off of linus for a second um i think you probably remember this story but aj was the first person that
[6431.92 --> 6438.24]  i hired like by myself um yeah and i thought it was really weird that someone was like joining the
[6438.24 --> 6445.20]  company and had never talked to yvonne um which doesn't matter anymore and is like totally normal
[6445.20 --> 6450.80]  but at that point in time was genuinely weird yeah um she handled like onboarding and a lot of stuff
[6450.80 --> 6456.24]  like she was part of like every hiring before then i think to a certain degree yeah yeah so i was like
[6456.24 --> 6460.32]  yeah she even helped me review resumes back when i hired you at ncis yeah yeah like she was she was
[6460.32 --> 6465.92]  uh and like now there's just there's no way right like we're such a huge company not even just yvonne
[6465.92 --> 6471.36]  like most people aren't gonna know anything about it when you're brought on because we're so big but
[6471.36 --> 6476.40]  back then it was weird so i i just like i was on the phone with him talking about it and then i was
[6476.40 --> 6479.76]  just like oh yeah you should like talk to yvonne and i just handed the phone to yvonne
[6479.76 --> 6486.56]  and they both just sat there and were like uh you know both their personalities they would both do
[6486.56 --> 6493.12]  that and it's like didn't really say anything it was incredibly awkward and i just threw them both
[6493.12 --> 6497.60]  into this scenario with no prep no planning no instructions on like maybe what they should
[6497.60 --> 6502.88]  talk about or anything eventually i just i i don't remember what happened after that but i think
[6502.88 --> 6510.72]  i eventually just took the phone back and was like sorry so yeah my bad uh
[6513.92 --> 6518.80]  yeah you you actually can be quite awkward too sometimes yeah it's in a different way though
[6518.80 --> 6523.28]  he's like an aggressive kind of awkward and i'm like uh like an offensive kind of awkward
[6523.28 --> 6535.52]  because like okay a big part of my sense of humor is saying something that i think is so ridiculously
[6535.52 --> 6542.24]  stupid or so ridiculously outlandish or offensive that nobody could possibly take it seriously and
[6542.24 --> 6548.72]  then where i run into trouble is that a lot of people take it seriously either because they
[6548.72 --> 6554.80]  have no idea anything about me so and and they just know the position and they have people in
[6554.80 --> 6560.00]  their lives who are that stupid or that mean or whatever yeah and so they just like assume that
[6560.00 --> 6568.16]  that's actually my real thoughts or my real demeanor or you've got people that just don't pick up social
[6568.16 --> 6576.08]  cues and even when i like laugh after are just like oh he's mean or they suddenly think that you are
[6576.08 --> 6584.64]  totally on their side and this is something that they are totally for which one was that oh oh yeah
[6584.64 --> 6592.08]  well yeah so anyway and then it's like oh yes so a lot of the time i accidentally say stuff that is like
[6592.08 --> 6599.12]  plausible to people even though to me it's like ridiculous right like you'll you'll i use verbal irony
[6599.12 --> 6605.44]  a lot um you know we're all instead of and it is not quite the same thing as sarcasm sarcasm is
[6605.44 --> 6610.56]  cutting whereas verbal irony is just saying one thing and meaning the complete opposite so i will
[6610.56 --> 6615.68]  say something like we'll be talking about nestle and i'll say but obviously water isn't a fundamental
[6615.68 --> 6620.72]  human right anyway i mean what makes humans more entitled to it than fish so realistically if people
[6620.72 --> 6624.08]  are dying because they don't have access to nestle then they should prioritize their pro or
[6624.08 --> 6628.16]  actually nestle should prioritize their profits i suspect that the way and show audience of any
[6628.16 --> 6633.20]  audience that you have will understand that more probably more pretty often do that on way because
[6633.20 --> 6638.64]  they see me free flow it more but they also like miss it sometimes yeah oh absolutely i'm just
[6638.64 --> 6644.16]  saying uh curiosity that section to repost on red curiosity says nestle what's that pronunciation
[6644.16 --> 6650.16]  that pronunciation is nestle the pronunciation anybody think that accent a goo is um
[6651.68 --> 6658.32]  that that it guys that is the that is the that's how you pronounce it i'm i'm pretty a dude man if i'm wrong
[6658.32 --> 6665.04]  about this i'm just i'm done with the show today i think they're saying it's nestle is that what they
[6665.04 --> 6671.12]  think it is no they think it's nestle that's how america lee yeah yeah is this like them saying niche
[6671.12 --> 6677.60]  instead of niche have you never heard nestle um nestle yeah there's no way you've never heard that
[6677.60 --> 6686.08]  it's always nestle don't i don't talk to americans apparently i think most canadians call it nestle as
[6686.08 --> 6692.08]  well maybe maybe i was just hearing nestle when they said nestle probably i'm pretty sure like like
[6692.08 --> 6699.76]  my brain english-speaking canadians say nestle yeah i just assumed apparently in the english-speaking
[6699.76 --> 6710.32]  world the ads do pronounce it nestle interesting uh however the actual spelling of it um this is
[6710.32 --> 6716.32]  this is a french accent which is present in the branding let's play it here hold on no no no that's
[6716.32 --> 6722.64]  fine oh no are we going to be wrong for the first times in our lives uh no could never happen yeah so
[6722.64 --> 6731.84]  if you look this is an accent aigou and it means a uh like okay i was going to say terminé but that's
[6731.84 --> 6737.04]  actually with two e's instead of an accent i think uh anyway like so like a french word with an e
[6737.04 --> 6741.52]  at the end that has that accent or even if it's not at the end it sounds like aj saying that he
[6741.52 --> 6746.96]  pronounces it that way well yeah well because it's french and because it's a french word with a
[6746.96 --> 6753.76]  french accent on it but um english doesn't have accent aigou so we just say nestle apparently
[6753.76 --> 6759.76]  even though that would be pronounced nestle um which is an actual word so why we pronounce it nestle
[6759.76 --> 6766.24]  maybe nestle did that on purpose so that we wouldn't think their name was nestle i'm not sure i don't know
[6766.24 --> 6774.56]  the origin but apparently apparently they uh they do use nestle in their marketing according to float
[6774.56 --> 6780.32]  plain chat people don't believe me they're like look it up on an actual product like like nestle quick
[6781.28 --> 6782.00]  it's there look
[6786.72 --> 6792.00]  see excellent they flatten it they flatten the accent because they are they also have it over the other
[6792.00 --> 6796.08]  letters i thought it was just a design thing no they sometimes don't have it over the other letters
[6796.08 --> 6801.04]  here hold on yeah here on this one uh oh no that one is over the other letters yep no you're right
[6801.04 --> 6810.40]  uh what about i don't think it always is though fred said on flow plane what about fiance fiance uh i
[6810.40 --> 6816.80]  think it does have an accent it does but but so many but so many english words have french origins and
[6816.80 --> 6822.32]  that's why we pronounce them the way that we do but unless you actually like took french in school or
[6822.32 --> 6827.92]  whatever you don't recognize those things that were either part of um part of the french and english
[6827.92 --> 6833.76]  languages uh simultaneous development and sort of came from the latin origin versus things that were
[6833.76 --> 6839.12]  just kind of picked up from each other in our dialects um yeah there's there's there's a there's a
[6839.12 --> 6844.80]  there's a ton of words that are english words but we kind of pronounce in a french way just because
[6844.80 --> 6850.00]  like originally they were french words or like whatever also applies to multiple other languages 100
[6850.00 --> 6856.88]  percent i i do know that in england back in the old days they used to say nestles um and even the
[6856.88 --> 6861.44]  commercials had that too they also came up with the word soccer and then are now mad at other people
[6861.44 --> 6866.32]  for using it so i don't know but the big question is why are we giving any air time to an evil company
[6866.32 --> 6870.64]  that steals people's drinking water that's a good call yeah we should just keep pronouncing their name
[6870.64 --> 6874.48]  wrong yeah let's call them nestle from metal yeah i'm going with no one will be able to find any
[6874.48 --> 6878.16]  information about them because they're going to look up nestle they're going to be like birds getting
[6878.16 --> 6886.32]  in a little nest nestling in there yeah they won't even find chocolate drink
[6890.40 --> 6894.80]  what are we supposed to be talking about just more topics until you're done with the topics uh
[6894.80 --> 6899.20]  uh vmware stuff
[6900.40 --> 6907.52]  liquid cooler innovation uh sure oh yeah we talked about did we even talk about the
[6907.52 --> 6913.84]  did we even read the notes on the gta 6 trailer no oh my god i don't think literally at all
[6914.64 --> 6919.20]  may 2nd rockstar announced the release date for gta no no it's fine there's that we we talked about
[6919.20 --> 6922.80]  it enough don't care cool yeah all right well it's not that we don't care it's just that we like did
[6922.80 --> 6927.44]  kind of cover not coming to pc for a while doesn't matter to me cool all right i'm gonna collapse
[6927.44 --> 6931.92]  some of the ones we've done already do you want to do the ai roundup good lord is there for a lot
[6931.92 --> 6938.32]  this week there's no spicy stuff there's no spicy stuff no i said there's some spicy stuff oh good
[6938.32 --> 6944.72]  because yeah wow i was not i was not on the same page the first one is wild yeah hit me so the first
[6944.72 --> 6951.20]  mini topic is judge accepts ai testimony from dead man christopher pelkey was killed in a road rage
[6951.20 --> 6957.76]  incident in 2021 where he was shot in the chest an ai avatar created by the victim's family who was
[6957.76 --> 6963.52]  seeking the maximum sentence remember that for later was allowed to address the court and the ai's
[6963.52 --> 6968.72]  testimony included forgiving the accused and saying they might have been friends
[6970.64 --> 6974.64]  hollander says nitpick since there are a lot of words in english from french but english is germanic
[6974.64 --> 6981.36]  and nordic in origin not latin the latin influences came later thank you carry on okay uh the judge
[6981.36 --> 6988.00]  seemed to be moved by the testimony saying to the victim's family i heard the forgiveness and you
[6988.00 --> 6993.92]  allowed chris to speak from his heart as you saw it i didn't hear him asking for the maximum sentence
[6993.92 --> 7000.40]  but then the judge handed down the maximum sentence anyway of ten and a half years
[7002.64 --> 7010.16]  what did we just witness here there are so many layers of up to unpack what
[7012.96 --> 7020.48]  so so the victims so the prosecution side the the relatives of the murdered guy
[7020.48 --> 7028.32]  make an ai based on presumably some kind of record his brain's broken some kind of records of the guy
[7028.32 --> 7040.32]  who was killed right the ai the judge allows the ai avatar to um did they question like a live llm
[7040.32 --> 7046.80]  that had an animated avatar or is this a video i believe so that's my understanding correct me if
[7046.80 --> 7057.20]  i'm wrong please chat jump in there jump in there the judge allowed the ai avatar to be interviewed to
[7057.20 --> 7064.64]  to testify and then the the ai forgave the accused saying they might have been friends
[7066.72 --> 7072.96]  and then the judge said i didn't hear him asking for the maximum sentence but then
[7072.96 --> 7078.08]  handed down the maximum sentence anyway which apparently the prosecution was seeking so this
[7078.08 --> 7083.04]  whole like ai testimony thing could have backfired on them super hard
[7089.28 --> 7095.36]  it's a statement written by the person's wife as the ai avatar is is that what it was
[7097.20 --> 7099.60]  video for impact statement okay hold on
[7103.36 --> 7106.48]  Stacy the people to think it's not great about you remember her
[7107.60 --> 7118.48]  be at my advocate appearing and it sounds like Patricia's woman who's trying to看看
[7118.48 --> 7130.72]  theaat pandemic but these spring Chelsea found herself in constant vibration we zabt
[7130.72 --> 7132.72]  the spirit of Chris. I'm not going to let
[7132.72 --> 7133.40]  this be shown.
[7136.30 --> 7138.42]  Okay, so it's just an AI avatar
[7138.42 --> 7140.48]  reading the impact statement.
[7140.96 --> 7141.32]  Yeah.
[7143.66 --> 7144.14]  What?
[7144.88 --> 7146.50]  Whoa. Okay, it's
[7146.50 --> 7147.50]  less stupid.
[7148.48 --> 7150.60]  That's still... I thought that was the only way
[7150.60 --> 7152.40]  it would ever happen. That's still... Okay,
[7152.56 --> 7154.60]  that's... Okay, we gotta...
[7155.20 --> 7155.94]  Okay, AI
[7155.94 --> 7158.62]  was allowed to address the court. Okay, it would
[7158.62 --> 7160.14]  have been nice to have that detail in here.
[7160.72 --> 7161.72]  Um...
[7161.72 --> 7166.58]  I don't think that makes it less nuts.
[7169.30 --> 7170.64]  The defendant's attorney
[7170.64 --> 7172.64]  called the presentation inflammatory
[7172.64 --> 7174.74]  and said it created a strong
[7174.74 --> 7176.66]  issue for appeal. I actually, like,
[7176.72 --> 7178.56]  kind of agree, which is sort of
[7178.56 --> 7180.72]  unfortunate because, obviously, I
[7180.72 --> 7182.82]  would just, you know, if they found the guy guilty,
[7182.82 --> 7184.86]  I would just like to see justice served at this point
[7184.86 --> 7186.56]  rather than us dragging this out.
[7186.92 --> 7188.60]  Yeah. But I feel like you're setting
[7188.60 --> 7190.70]  precedence almost. Well, I mean, this whole thing
[7190.70 --> 7192.70]  is precedent setting, like...
[7193.30 --> 7194.70]  So you reanimate...
[7195.22 --> 7196.58]  It was post-conviction, but
[7196.58 --> 7198.74]  before sentencing. But then, hold on a second.
[7198.92 --> 7200.62]  Why? So if they're...
[7200.62 --> 7202.70]  See, the victim's family who was seeking
[7202.70 --> 7204.78]  the maximum sentence, remember that for later,
[7204.86 --> 7206.58]  was allowed to address the court, and then
[7206.58 --> 7208.06]  the judge was moved by it saying,
[7208.64 --> 7210.72]  you allowed Chris to speak from as hard as you saw it,
[7210.74 --> 7212.48]  I didn't hear him asking for the maximum sentence.
[7212.48 --> 7213.86]  So did they just, like...
[7213.86 --> 7215.66]  And then gave the maximum sentence anyway.
[7215.66 --> 7217.52]  So they just wrote a victim statement
[7217.52 --> 7220.88]  that contradicted the sentence they were seeking
[7220.88 --> 7221.48]  and the...
[7221.48 --> 7223.60]  And the sentence that was given.
[7224.18 --> 7225.16]  They're like, they already found him guilty.
[7225.24 --> 7227.52]  I know, I know, but this is like sentencing, right?
[7227.60 --> 7229.94]  Like, sentencing is part of just seeing justice served out
[7229.94 --> 7231.54]  according to our current system,
[7231.58 --> 7232.58]  whether you agree with it or not.
[7236.52 --> 7237.78]  I want to move on.
[7238.18 --> 7238.64]  Let's do that.
[7238.64 --> 7240.92]  The AI app lets you see what others are doing
[7240.92 --> 7241.98]  with generative AI.
[7242.14 --> 7244.42]  The Verge calls it a mashup of Pinterest
[7244.42 --> 7246.76]  and everything annoying about threads.
[7248.36 --> 7251.64]  With a sprinkling of generative AI on top.
[7251.70 --> 7252.76]  That's a great comparison.
[7253.22 --> 7254.30]  It's hard to explain.
[7254.58 --> 7255.54]  Look at these examples.
[7256.20 --> 7257.60]  Mixing food and fashion.
[7258.86 --> 7259.54]  Gary V.
[7259.98 --> 7260.18]  What?
[7260.34 --> 7261.40]  So Gary Vaynerchuk.
[7261.56 --> 7261.80]  Yeah.
[7262.04 --> 7264.44]  Tells a 98-year-old that he's still got time
[7264.44 --> 7265.64]  to make it on Meta.
[7268.64 --> 7270.74]  Is that mixing food and fashion?
[7270.80 --> 7272.22]  No, that's the second one.
[7272.22 --> 7273.78]  Sorry, I was more interested in this one.
[7273.96 --> 7275.32]  I saw him speak in person once.
[7275.32 --> 7276.92]  That one's listed as Gary V. yelling at an old man.
[7277.14 --> 7277.40]  Yeah.
[7278.30 --> 7278.66]  Okay.
[7279.18 --> 7281.10]  I'm going to go with can't escape the clown.
[7282.18 --> 7283.96]  Imagine a room without a clown in it.
[7284.08 --> 7285.32]  You can make the room however you want
[7285.32 --> 7286.62]  in whatever style you want,
[7286.70 --> 7288.68]  but do not put a clown in the room.
[7291.40 --> 7292.18]  Wait, so what?
[7292.26 --> 7293.98]  It like always puts a clown in the room?
[7295.90 --> 7297.30]  There's always a clown in the room.
[7297.30 --> 7298.30]  Why is there...
[7298.30 --> 7300.18]  Luke, why is there always a clown in the room?
[7300.28 --> 7301.82]  I don't know if we could have had a pre-prompt or something.
[7301.88 --> 7302.30]  That's weird.
[7302.40 --> 7302.76]  I don't know.
[7302.96 --> 7303.26]  I don't know.
[7304.66 --> 7305.02]  Okay.
[7305.52 --> 7306.96]  So what's the point of this?
[7308.70 --> 7310.20]  I mean, I guess if our social media
[7310.20 --> 7312.22]  is just all going to be AI-generated slop,
[7312.34 --> 7313.14]  then it might as well...
[7313.14 --> 7314.92]  We might as well just be forthcoming with that.
[7316.46 --> 7316.80]  Yeah.
[7316.82 --> 7319.24]  Apparently people are cheating in like Counter-Strike now.
[7320.06 --> 7321.38]  They're not even at their computer.
[7322.76 --> 7324.40]  It's just AI is playing the whole game.
[7324.40 --> 7325.68]  So the AI is aimbotting,
[7325.80 --> 7328.12]  but it's also just entirely a bot.
[7328.68 --> 7330.50]  And it's not even someone playing the game.
[7331.30 --> 7333.32]  This is happening in lobbies to try to get like,
[7333.44 --> 7335.38]  I don't know, I'm assuming drops or whatever.
[7335.66 --> 7336.42]  I have no idea.
[7337.00 --> 7337.32]  Cases?
[7337.60 --> 7337.96]  I don't know.
[7338.16 --> 7338.40]  Something.
[7342.00 --> 7345.02]  And it's like fairly widespread in public matches apparently.
[7345.36 --> 7346.22]  It is clear.
[7346.56 --> 7347.20]  You know what?
[7347.20 --> 7349.78]  I actually noticed the last few times
[7349.78 --> 7351.18]  that I was playing Counter-Strike,
[7351.44 --> 7352.24]  like for videos,
[7353.00 --> 7354.86]  that just dropping into a public match
[7354.86 --> 7356.00]  is flipping hard now.
[7356.72 --> 7357.78]  Like I'm just getting,
[7357.94 --> 7359.90]  I am getting like blown away
[7359.90 --> 7361.90]  from all over the map
[7361.90 --> 7362.82]  in a way that like,
[7362.88 --> 7363.92]  I'm not good at Counter-Strike.
[7364.02 --> 7365.44]  Like I'm not good at Counter-Strike.
[7365.54 --> 7366.88]  But it seems like a new level.
[7367.00 --> 7367.88]  Part of that is I think
[7367.88 --> 7369.66]  a lot of people don't play multiplayer games
[7369.66 --> 7370.86]  for like fun anymore.
[7371.32 --> 7371.92]  But I'm just,
[7372.02 --> 7373.70]  I'm just going into like public lobbies though.
[7373.78 --> 7375.12]  It's a competitive career.
[7375.12 --> 7375.90]  But,
[7376.00 --> 7377.28]  like the amount of people
[7377.28 --> 7380.20]  that literally just sit in aim trainers for hours.
[7380.42 --> 7380.48]  Dude,
[7380.48 --> 7382.08]  but my MMR is trash.
[7382.42 --> 7384.18]  It was on like the LTD benchmark account.
[7384.28 --> 7385.06]  Like there's no way.
[7385.36 --> 7385.70]  You know,
[7385.84 --> 7386.20]  maybe,
[7386.28 --> 7388.44]  maybe John is just a killer at Counter-Strike.
[7388.46 --> 7388.78]  I mean,
[7388.84 --> 7389.38]  that's possible.
[7389.56 --> 7390.04]  You never know.
[7390.58 --> 7392.40]  Could be just in there popping heads.
[7393.06 --> 7393.46]  Boom!
[7393.92 --> 7396.08]  It's clear we need to bring back LAN gaming
[7396.08 --> 7398.60]  like faster and harder than ever.
[7399.12 --> 7400.50]  Like let's go Wail LAN.
[7400.90 --> 7401.26]  Wait,
[7401.26 --> 7402.10]  did I update people?
[7402.26 --> 7404.34]  The city of Surrey seems very amenable
[7404.34 --> 7404.94]  and they're like,
[7405.06 --> 7406.34]  like super duper working on it.
[7406.64 --> 7407.38]  I know you told me,
[7407.46 --> 7408.48]  but I don't know if it was on the show right now.
[7408.48 --> 7408.58]  Yeah,
[7408.60 --> 7409.18]  I can't remember.
[7410.18 --> 7410.54]  Whatever.
[7410.70 --> 7411.30]  We met the mayor.
[7411.42 --> 7413.18]  We had a really good chat about like,
[7413.22 --> 7413.46]  let's,
[7413.56 --> 7414.44]  let's go gaming,
[7414.60 --> 7415.04]  esports,
[7415.24 --> 7415.58]  badminton.
[7415.98 --> 7416.90]  We're going to make it happen.
[7417.38 --> 7417.54]  Yeah,
[7417.60 --> 7418.08]  it's going to be awesome.
[7418.36 --> 7418.76]  Next one.
[7418.86 --> 7420.30]  Has AI broken university?
[7420.44 --> 7421.98]  Multiple stories have gained traction this week,
[7422.04 --> 7424.28]  calling attention to the trend of students relying on AI
[7424.28 --> 7426.02]  to complete university coursework
[7426.02 --> 7429.96]  and the struggle of universities to adjust to the new reality.
[7430.48 --> 7430.92]  Headlines,
[7431.30 --> 7431.80]  uh,
[7432.00 --> 7434.02]  New York mag or NY mag,
[7434.34 --> 7434.68]  whatever.
[7435.08 --> 7435.24]  Uh,
[7435.24 --> 7436.90]  everyone is cheating their way through college.
[7436.98 --> 7438.80]  And New Yorkers other headline was,
[7438.96 --> 7441.90]  will the humanities survive artificial intelligence?
[7442.54 --> 7443.54]  Quotes from students.
[7443.68 --> 7445.42]  This is a oddly written article.
[7445.66 --> 7446.14]  Um,
[7446.14 --> 7447.04]  quotes from students.
[7447.42 --> 7451.60]  College is just how well I can use chat GPT at this point.
[7451.60 --> 7456.50]  Another one is I spent so much time on Tik TOK hours and hours until my eyes start hurting,
[7456.66 --> 7459.56]  which makes it hard to plan and do my schoolwork.
[7459.62 --> 7460.76]  This is very honest.
[7461.22 --> 7461.46]  Uh,
[7461.46 --> 7462.40]  with chat GPT,
[7462.52 --> 7465.60]  I can write an essay in two hours that normally takes 12.
[7466.28 --> 7466.72]  Wow.
[7466.90 --> 7467.16]  Dr.
[7467.24 --> 7467.96]  Mike Perkins,
[7468.10 --> 7473.38]  a generative AI researcher told the guardian that AI detection software is unreliable.
[7473.54 --> 7473.76]  Yeah.
[7474.20 --> 7475.18]  And they're very easily tricked.
[7475.32 --> 7475.58]  Yeah.
[7475.94 --> 7476.42]  Um,
[7476.42 --> 7477.10]  has research,
[7477.18 --> 7479.62]  has research found his research,
[7479.62 --> 7480.28]  his research.
[7480.28 --> 7481.60]  Uh,
[7481.60 --> 7485.98]  that AI detectors could detect AI text with an accuracy of 39.5%,
[7485.98 --> 7490.52]  but with minor manipulations of the text and other simple evasion techniques,
[7490.76 --> 7493.54]  accuracy dropped to just 22.1%.
[7493.54 --> 7496.74]  A tool that is 22% effective is not a tool.
[7497.14 --> 7497.42]  Yeah.
[7497.44 --> 7498.12]  That's a novelty.
[7498.60 --> 7501.54]  Can we stop live editing the doc by any chance?
[7501.78 --> 7502.34]  Um,
[7502.36 --> 7503.68]  it keeps bouncing around.
[7503.76 --> 7504.00]  Not me.
[7504.10 --> 7506.16]  I literally just had to scroll to find where I was at.
[7506.56 --> 7507.04]  Um,
[7507.30 --> 7508.20]  oh my goodness.
[7508.54 --> 7509.24]  Is that you,
[7509.24 --> 7509.48]  Dan?
[7510.28 --> 7513.34]  Researchers at the university of Reading,
[7513.46 --> 7516.06]  I believe conducted a blind test in 2024,
[7516.36 --> 7520.40]  submitting chat GPT written answers through the university's own exam system.
[7520.40 --> 7526.76]  And 94% of the AI submissions went undetected and received higher scores than those submitted by the humans.
[7527.12 --> 7527.88]  Oh no.
[7528.14 --> 7528.72]  We're cooked.
[7528.88 --> 7531.56]  The discussion question on this is actually the main reason why I wanted to talk about it.
[7531.56 --> 7533.88]  Are you going to insist your kids go to college?
[7535.42 --> 7535.76]  No.
[7537.04 --> 7537.44]  Um,
[7537.54 --> 7542.02]  the one thing that I want my kids to do is pursue entrepreneurship.
[7543.38 --> 7543.78]  Because,
[7544.30 --> 7546.32]  and I've had this conversation on when countless times,
[7546.38 --> 7547.96]  so I'm not going to rehash the whole thing,
[7548.02 --> 7548.64]  but basically,
[7548.64 --> 7549.86]  um,
[7549.86 --> 7552.36]  there is an unlimited ceiling on,
[7552.36 --> 7552.90]  you know,
[7553.46 --> 7557.68]  pursuing something better and newer and different.
[7558.12 --> 7558.40]  Uh,
[7558.40 --> 7565.80]  whereas there is always going to be a finite ceiling on doing the same task over and over and over and over and over again.
[7565.80 --> 7568.42]  And I think part of that comes from being an entrepreneur.
[7568.42 --> 7571.84]  And part of that comes from working in a creative industry where even,
[7571.84 --> 7577.36]  even our Mick jobs for the most part are not Mick jobs because there is,
[7577.54 --> 7579.08]  there's no such thing as like,
[7579.44 --> 7580.24]  just your,
[7580.50 --> 7581.70]  you just move the thing.
[7581.80 --> 7587.80]  You move the thing from point a to point B in accordance with the way that corporate prescribes.
[7588.98 --> 7589.30]  Um,
[7589.32 --> 7591.80]  there's room for user input on literally,
[7592.74 --> 7595.78]  I'm trying to think of a job here that this is not,
[7595.80 --> 7602.66]  true for like literally every position here requires you to engage your bloody brain.
[7603.42 --> 7603.86]  Um,
[7604.86 --> 7605.54]  and so I,
[7605.54 --> 7605.90]  I would,
[7606.02 --> 7607.86]  I would like for my kids that they,
[7608.04 --> 7609.24]  that they not get bored.
[7609.24 --> 7611.62]  And this is actually something that I learned from Taryn.
[7611.70 --> 7612.54]  He basically goes,
[7612.66 --> 7612.82]  look,
[7613.40 --> 7613.88]  um,
[7614.32 --> 7616.06]  when you're not learning anything anymore,
[7616.06 --> 7619.42]  that's when it's time to leave your current place of work,
[7619.42 --> 7620.42]  you know,
[7620.42 --> 7620.92]  for him,
[7621.08 --> 7621.62]  obviously,
[7621.62 --> 7622.00]  you know,
[7622.04 --> 7624.30]  other factors like location and pay.
[7624.38 --> 7624.88]  These are all,
[7624.88 --> 7626.08]  these are all considerations,
[7626.50 --> 7627.12]  obviously,
[7627.12 --> 7632.84]  but the red line is when I am not learning anything anymore,
[7632.84 --> 7634.92]  it's time to go.
[7635.62 --> 7636.06]  Um,
[7636.06 --> 7636.72]  and so I would,
[7636.80 --> 7638.56]  I would like for wherever they land,
[7638.58 --> 7641.38]  I would like for them to have that always learning,
[7641.54 --> 7644.38]  always pursuing something higher mindset.
[7644.38 --> 7644.90]  That's,
[7644.96 --> 7645.30]  I hope.
[7645.36 --> 7645.86]  That's good.
[7645.94 --> 7646.62]  I don't think,
[7646.68 --> 7648.42]  because some people are going to take this all as advice.
[7648.42 --> 7650.36]  And I think some of that is probably good to take as,
[7650.50 --> 7651.12]  as advice.
[7651.36 --> 7655.94]  I don't think necessarily pushing every single kid with every single set of opportunities
[7655.94 --> 7657.84]  into entrepreneurship is,
[7657.84 --> 7658.78]  okay,
[7658.84 --> 7659.60]  it's not what he said.
[7660.02 --> 7660.52]  It's not what he said.
[7660.52 --> 7660.68]  Yeah,
[7660.68 --> 7660.86]  no,
[7660.90 --> 7661.54]  not necessarily.
[7661.76 --> 7662.38]  My kids have,
[7662.52 --> 7663.32]  my kids are privileged.
[7663.44 --> 7664.20]  They have a safety net.
[7664.42 --> 7664.68]  We're not,
[7664.78 --> 7664.98]  let's,
[7665.10 --> 7665.54]  let's not.
[7665.68 --> 7668.38]  It's a lot easier to experiment with entrepreneurship.
[7669.10 --> 7669.80]  And I mean,
[7669.88 --> 7671.70]  let's not show you the best possible route.
[7671.80 --> 7672.30]  They should go.
[7672.42 --> 7673.10]  I do agree.
[7673.26 --> 7673.40]  Yeah.
[7673.40 --> 7677.12]  I'm just saying some people are going to take this in a way that it wasn't,
[7677.20 --> 7677.44]  which is,
[7677.50 --> 7678.12]  it's not advice.
[7678.24 --> 7680.12]  It's the question was what he will do.
[7680.76 --> 7680.86]  And,
[7680.92 --> 7681.66]  and you know what?
[7681.72 --> 7682.34]  Like it,
[7682.44 --> 7683.28]  it might not,
[7683.42 --> 7684.88]  they might not even pursue that,
[7684.94 --> 7685.14]  right?
[7685.16 --> 7688.18]  Like one of my kids wants to be a vet.
[7688.70 --> 7692.44]  You can't just like be a vet by not going to university.
[7693.10 --> 7694.22]  That's not how that works.
[7694.28 --> 7696.62]  You actually like need to go to veterinary.
[7696.62 --> 7700.80]  You are going to medical school just for animals instead of for people.
[7700.80 --> 7701.88]  Um,
[7702.10 --> 7703.62]  and so,
[7703.74 --> 7703.88]  you know,
[7703.92 --> 7704.10]  whatever,
[7704.20 --> 7705.02]  whatever they want to do,
[7705.10 --> 7705.26]  you know,
[7705.28 --> 7706.34]  we want to be supportive,
[7706.68 --> 7707.22]  right?
[7708.66 --> 7710.42]  Maybe they'll do something with turquoise.
[7716.82 --> 7717.50]  All right.
[7718.10 --> 7718.26]  Uh,
[7718.26 --> 7718.84]  next one,
[7718.92 --> 7721.26]  new AI model lets robots clean up homes.
[7721.38 --> 7722.76]  It's never seen before.
[7723.00 --> 7723.52]  Ooh.
[7723.52 --> 7730.60]  The Pi 05 is a VLA vision language action model general enough to be useful in
[7730.60 --> 7731.74]  entirely new environments.
[7731.88 --> 7736.10]  The model enables a cleaning robot to understand semantic context and to
[7736.10 --> 7737.82]  infer the structure of a task.
[7737.92 --> 7738.56]  For example,
[7738.56 --> 7739.56]  when cleaning the kitchen,
[7739.68 --> 7743.08]  knowing what items are appropriate to pick up and put away and where to
[7743.08 --> 7743.46]  put them.
[7743.52 --> 7745.76]  So I guess it could look in a cupboard and see if the plates are there or
[7745.76 --> 7745.94]  whatever.
[7746.26 --> 7746.64]  Um,
[7746.64 --> 7750.50]  it's also possible to coach the bot through multiple steps of a complex
[7750.50 --> 7752.42]  process with natural language.
[7753.88 --> 7758.84]  This is the kind of stuff I think people want from AI in its defense.
[7758.84 --> 7759.84]  Uh,
[7760.62 --> 7762.32]  AI recruiter glitching goes viral.
[7762.48 --> 7763.02]  TikTok user,
[7763.12 --> 7766.12]  it's can Oh four posted a recording of part of a job interview.
[7766.12 --> 7770.02]  Her first meeting with a prospective employer in which the AI recruiter
[7770.02 --> 7774.96]  repeats vertical bar Pilates more than a dozen times.
[7777.52 --> 7778.86]  Stumbling over the words.
[7779.44 --> 7779.70]  Uh,
[7779.70 --> 7783.42]  the AI was part of a platform called appropriate or sorry,
[7783.50 --> 7783.60]  uh,
[7783.82 --> 7784.12]  uh,
[7784.40 --> 7784.62]  uh,
[7784.62 --> 7785.16]  Priora,
[7785.44 --> 7785.76]  whatever.
[7786.18 --> 7786.66]  Um,
[7786.78 --> 7791.50]  which claims to help companies hire 87% faster and interview 93% cheaper
[7791.50 --> 7792.76]  comments on the video.
[7792.76 --> 7796.26]  We're almost universally against the use of AI interviewers with one noting
[7796.26 --> 7798.66]  that if they're not taking the time to interview me,
[7798.66 --> 7800.42]  I'm not taking the time to try to work there.
[7800.54 --> 7801.98]  This is a huge thing.
[7802.04 --> 7803.12]  I don't know how much you've heard about this.
[7803.22 --> 7806.68]  I haven't heard a lot of places are using this stuff and people hate it.
[7806.74 --> 7806.86]  Okay.
[7806.86 --> 7807.46]  Tell me this,
[7807.54 --> 7808.08]  tell me this.
[7808.08 --> 7809.58]  And I'm about to find something out.
[7809.72 --> 7810.22]  So I'm,
[7810.22 --> 7810.46]  I'm,
[7810.46 --> 7814.04]  I'm f***ing around right now and I might be about to find out.
[7814.14 --> 7814.48]  Oh,
[7814.80 --> 7816.82]  do we use AI for our hiring?
[7817.20 --> 7817.60]  No.
[7818.26 --> 7818.48]  Well,
[7818.58 --> 7818.70]  I,
[7819.04 --> 7822.40]  you don't have to like give me the like corporate puffery version.
[7822.50 --> 7822.58]  Like,
[7822.62 --> 7824.76]  do we know at all?
[7825.44 --> 7826.22]  Not as far as I know.
[7826.86 --> 7827.22]  Okay.
[7827.26 --> 7827.56]  And well,
[7827.56 --> 7830.14]  will you like have hired people in the last like weeks?
[7830.14 --> 7830.72]  So like,
[7830.72 --> 7831.34]  if you don't know,
[7831.40 --> 7832.00]  then I assume,
[7832.62 --> 7832.86]  okay,
[7832.94 --> 7833.06]  well,
[7833.10 --> 7835.70]  maybe I think my no is a pretty good answer.
[7835.86 --> 7837.38]  I'm not involved in all the hiring,
[7837.38 --> 7838.96]  but I've done hiring recently.
[7838.96 --> 7841.96]  We have a person who's still under probation.
[7842.02 --> 7842.64]  So I'm not going to name them,
[7842.70 --> 7844.64]  but we have a person on the labs team that is new.
[7844.78 --> 7846.52]  So clearly within the last 90 days,
[7846.68 --> 7847.84]  no part of that involved.
[7847.98 --> 7848.24]  Okay.
[7848.88 --> 7849.28]  All right.
[7849.80 --> 7850.50]  And do we,
[7850.70 --> 7854.66]  do we feel that that is the best path as of right now?
[7854.68 --> 7854.98]  I would say,
[7855.02 --> 7855.20]  yeah.
[7855.52 --> 7855.76]  Yeah.
[7855.80 --> 7855.98]  Okay.
[7855.98 --> 7857.62]  I don't know if I'll hold that line forever,
[7857.62 --> 7858.74]  but I mean,
[7858.80 --> 7858.96]  I,
[7858.96 --> 7859.34]  I,
[7859.34 --> 7865.50]  I think I mentioned last week that like almost every interaction I had with,
[7865.50 --> 7866.16]  uh,
[7866.16 --> 7866.48]  uh,
[7866.48 --> 7869.74]  like chat based LLM recently had hallucinations in it.
[7870.00 --> 7870.40]  Um,
[7870.40 --> 7872.54]  despite the fact that people are saying hallucinations are going down.
[7873.02 --> 7873.46]  Um,
[7873.52 --> 7875.66]  I decided to try to push that even further.
[7875.66 --> 7877.72]  And that record is still standing.
[7877.84 --> 7878.62]  I don't have an example.
[7878.88 --> 7879.06]  Okay.
[7879.46 --> 7879.90]  Um,
[7880.62 --> 7881.46]  but it's,
[7881.60 --> 7882.92]  it's nearly constant.
[7882.92 --> 7886.68]  The one that I started running into recently was that it can't get dates.
[7886.68 --> 7886.96]  Right.
[7887.90 --> 7888.30]  Really?
[7888.30 --> 7890.44]  I was trying to get it to deal with a,
[7890.44 --> 7891.04]  uh,
[7891.04 --> 7893.32]  a timetable basically like not,
[7893.42 --> 7895.04]  not a check-in checkout thing,
[7895.04 --> 7897.78]  but like what is the plan over the course of this week?
[7897.90 --> 7899.60]  And it kept saying like,
[7899.80 --> 7900.00]  like,
[7900.02 --> 7901.02]  let me look at the calendar.
[7901.12 --> 7901.86]  It would say like,
[7901.86 --> 7902.72]  um,
[7903.06 --> 7903.50]  Saturday,
[7903.70 --> 7904.30]  May 11th.
[7906.46 --> 7906.90]  Wait,
[7907.50 --> 7908.10]  no.
[7908.78 --> 7909.04]  Yeah.
[7909.18 --> 7909.44]  Right.
[7909.54 --> 7909.84]  Okay.
[7909.84 --> 7911.72]  It doesn't look immediately wrong though.
[7911.98 --> 7912.12]  Yeah.
[7912.12 --> 7913.86]  And this is my big problem with the whole,
[7913.94 --> 7914.30]  uh,
[7914.30 --> 7914.90]  uh,
[7914.98 --> 7921.86]  people's perceptions on AI hallucinations is I think a lot of the times they're just looking at it surface level.
[7922.04 --> 7927.40]  And a lot of the things that it's going to be wrong on require at least one step of looking into it.
[7927.48 --> 7927.66]  Yeah.
[7927.70 --> 7930.44]  And people don't understand the whole part where it like it's,
[7930.44 --> 7933.38]  it's a really great kickoff tool for research.
[7933.46 --> 7933.60]  Yeah.
[7933.64 --> 7937.30]  It's a really great like writer's block solver.
[7937.46 --> 7937.66]  Yeah.
[7937.72 --> 7940.00]  It's a really great like bouncing off.
[7940.08 --> 7940.30]  Yeah.
[7940.30 --> 7942.92]  I used it to help name the smash champs badminton center.
[7943.12 --> 7943.52]  Sweet.
[7943.52 --> 7947.42]  Had it helped me come up with just like combinations of words,
[7947.60 --> 7949.58]  but it still requires you.
[7949.90 --> 7952.88]  And I think a lot of people are just trying to take its output and just crap it out.
[7952.92 --> 7953.34]  And it's like,
[7953.38 --> 7953.58]  man,
[7953.62 --> 7954.36]  that is not,
[7954.46 --> 7956.58]  you're not going to have a good time.
[7956.58 --> 7958.80]  Like there's so many things that are just slightly wrong.
[7958.80 --> 7959.42]  Like if you,
[7959.52 --> 7960.38]  if you go with that,
[7960.40 --> 7961.32]  like Saturday,
[7961.48 --> 7962.30]  May 11th thing,
[7962.30 --> 7965.48]  and then book something using the date of the 11th,
[7965.52 --> 7967.56]  you just horrifically screwed up.
[7967.66 --> 7968.02]  Right.
[7968.94 --> 7969.28]  Neat.
[7969.84 --> 7971.64]  And in like such a basic way.
[7971.64 --> 7972.78]  And when someone questions like,
[7972.86 --> 7974.56]  how did you book this on the wrong day?
[7974.56 --> 7976.50]  Like it was obvious when it was supposed to be.
[7976.54 --> 7976.92]  And you're like,
[7977.00 --> 7977.26]  well,
[7978.26 --> 7979.84]  that's not going to stand up.
[7979.88 --> 7980.52]  It's on you.
[7981.96 --> 7982.58]  I don't know.
[7982.64 --> 7982.98]  Anyways,
[7983.34 --> 7990.62]  unless everyone else involved in whatever that occasion was also relies on an LLM for daily tasks.
[7990.62 --> 7991.02]  And they're like,
[7991.04 --> 7991.34]  oh yeah,
[7991.42 --> 7991.60]  yeah,
[7991.96 --> 7993.52]  it's possible.
[7994.06 --> 7994.40]  Yeah,
[7994.42 --> 7995.86]  but it's a lot of mistakes.
[7997.32 --> 7997.88]  We'll see.
[7997.98 --> 7998.72]  We'll see how things go.
[7998.78 --> 7999.42]  But as of right now,
[7999.48 --> 7999.60]  no,
[7999.72 --> 8000.38]  this is cool.
[8000.76 --> 8005.82]  Having a perpetual license for software now means that you can get a cease and desist.
[8008.34 --> 8009.08]  Excuse me.
[8009.08 --> 8011.40]  I've talked about this in the past,
[8011.50 --> 8020.24]  how TeamViewer kept soliciting me to buy a subscription when what I actually had was a perpetual license for TeamViewer 12,
[8020.38 --> 8020.60]  which,
[8021.12 --> 8021.84]  by the way,
[8022.34 --> 8023.16]  I still own.
[8023.54 --> 8024.40]  And no,
[8024.62 --> 8026.52]  I do not have a TeamViewer subscription.
[8027.22 --> 8028.18]  They have stopped,
[8028.32 --> 8028.68]  by the way,
[8028.72 --> 8033.48]  so you don't need to like hate TeamViewer anymore or less than you already do right now.
[8033.48 --> 8040.98]  But I have talked in the past about this strategy that companies have where they will sell you a perpetual license to their product.
[8041.38 --> 8043.24]  And then in order to get out of that,
[8043.40 --> 8047.34]  they will introduce a new product that is that product,
[8047.46 --> 8050.88]  but version number plus one.
[8051.46 --> 8054.86]  And then they will force you to buy a subscription for it.
[8056.16 --> 8062.78]  I politely told TeamViewer to f*** right off with that and stop trying to sell me your subscription because I bought a perpetual license.
[8062.78 --> 8063.78]  I'm going to keep using it.
[8064.60 --> 8069.12]  But it looks like that strategy might not have worked here.
[8069.50 --> 8071.20]  Over the last several weeks,
[8071.58 --> 8076.86]  VMware users have been receiving cease and desist letters from Broadcom,
[8077.00 --> 8080.42]  who purchased VMware back in November of 2023.
[8081.38 --> 8082.74]  After the acquisition,
[8083.38 --> 8086.48]  VMware ended sale of the perpetual licenses,
[8086.82 --> 8090.14]  including ending support for those users.
[8090.48 --> 8091.34]  This was done.
[8091.34 --> 8093.14]  Drum roll please.
[8093.62 --> 8095.50]  To push their subscription model,
[8095.70 --> 8101.04]  which also increased by 300% or more after the acquisition.
[8101.70 --> 8108.74]  This cease and desist letter states that any implementation of updates past the expiration date
[8108.74 --> 8113.26]  must be immediately removed slash deinstalled,
[8113.26 --> 8113.74]  adding,
[8113.74 --> 8120.22]  any such use of support past the expiration date constitutes a material breach of the agreement with VMware
[8120.22 --> 8124.04]  and an infringement of VMware's intellectual property rights,
[8124.12 --> 8128.24]  potentially resulting in claims for enhanced damages and attorney's fees.
[8128.24 --> 8130.60]  This left some users confused,
[8130.60 --> 8136.14]  since they technically haven't received any updates or security patches since the support ended anyway.
[8137.46 --> 8137.94]  So,
[8137.94 --> 8139.04]  I guess,
[8139.14 --> 8139.46]  um,
[8139.72 --> 8140.68]  a f*** you,
[8140.84 --> 8141.44]  a Broadcom?
[8142.10 --> 8142.34]  Like,
[8142.34 --> 8143.16]  continued.
[8143.64 --> 8143.90]  Yeah.
[8145.36 --> 8145.90]  It's funny,
[8145.98 --> 8146.14]  because,
[8146.24 --> 8146.36]  like,
[8146.44 --> 8147.50]  wasn't VMware already,
[8147.50 --> 8147.78]  like,
[8147.84 --> 8148.60]  kind of hated?
[8153.54 --> 8155.46]  I don't think they were particularly well liked.
[8156.12 --> 8156.80]  Maybe not,
[8156.90 --> 8157.14]  but I don't,
[8157.14 --> 8159.36]  I don't think I would go as far as to say they were hated.
[8159.80 --> 8160.10]  I don't know.
[8160.16 --> 8161.08]  I think it was one of those things where,
[8161.18 --> 8161.32]  like,
[8161.32 --> 8162.04]  uh,
[8162.10 --> 8162.40]  okay,
[8162.50 --> 8162.82]  chats,
[8162.96 --> 8163.32]  uh,
[8164.90 --> 8165.24]  hold on,
[8165.28 --> 8165.54]  chat,
[8165.76 --> 8166.72]  let us know,
[8166.82 --> 8167.14]  because I,
[8167.14 --> 8167.50]  I don't know,
[8167.56 --> 8167.72]  I,
[8167.76 --> 8168.74]  I thought that was a,
[8168.74 --> 8169.76]  I thought that was a thing.
[8171.98 --> 8172.22]  Uh,
[8172.26 --> 8172.42]  yeah,
[8172.42 --> 8173.24]  people say a bit.
[8173.32 --> 8173.96]  I think it was a bit.
[8173.96 --> 8174.12]  Okay.
[8174.12 --> 8174.24]  Like,
[8174.24 --> 8174.98]  people didn't like it,
[8175.00 --> 8176.44]  but I think people didn't like it in the way that,
[8176.56 --> 8176.64]  like,
[8176.72 --> 8176.80]  a lot of people.
[8176.80 --> 8178.26]  I don't think people didn't like it as a tool.
[8178.48 --> 8180.00]  I think people love it as a tool,
[8180.08 --> 8180.94]  but didn't like the,
[8180.94 --> 8181.32]  uh,
[8181.50 --> 8182.42]  uh,
[8182.88 --> 8183.16]  uh,
[8183.16 --> 8185.56]  and the fact that that is so much more now.
[8185.90 --> 8186.30]  Uh,
[8186.36 --> 8186.64]  okay,
[8186.76 --> 8187.02]  yeah.
[8188.26 --> 8189.22]  Onik Hedge says,
[8189.22 --> 8191.26]  VMware has been up to some shenanigans for a while.
[8191.38 --> 8191.96]  That's the,
[8191.96 --> 8193.36]  the acquisition was a while ago.
[8193.36 --> 8195.10]  So I don't know if they,
[8195.82 --> 8196.58]  I don't know.
[8197.54 --> 8197.98]  Uh,
[8198.14 --> 8198.58]  okay.
[8201.08 --> 8201.52]  Yeah.
[8201.58 --> 8201.90]  Okay.
[8202.02 --> 8204.32]  It seems like either yes or meh.
[8204.76 --> 8205.16]  Um,
[8205.16 --> 8206.04]  someone says I'm not bad,
[8206.10 --> 8207.44]  not that bad until they got acquired.
[8207.54 --> 8207.80]  Okay.
[8208.46 --> 8208.78]  Uh,
[8208.78 --> 8209.30]  either way.
[8209.36 --> 8209.50]  Yeah,
[8209.50 --> 8210.64]  that sounds terrible.
[8210.64 --> 8212.44]  And this man,
[8212.56 --> 8214.08]  how can this can't be legal,
[8214.36 --> 8215.14]  you know,
[8215.66 --> 8218.96]  perpetual license that perpetual has a,
[8218.96 --> 8219.46]  a meaning.
[8219.58 --> 8221.04]  And I get your T's and C's or whatever.
[8221.16 --> 8227.28]  You could change your thing or liquid cooler innovation is about to skyrocket.
[8227.92 --> 8230.64]  Famed cooling innovator and also patent troll.
[8230.84 --> 8235.30]  Ace attack has had a stranglehold on the AIO water cooler market for years.
[8235.70 --> 8236.70]  20 years ago,
[8236.70 --> 8241.24]  they patented integrating the pump into the CPU cold plate in an AIO cooler,
[8241.48 --> 8244.12]  AKA the design that basically everyone uses.
[8244.46 --> 8248.48]  Since then they have become less of a cooling innovation company and more of a patent trolling company,
[8248.48 --> 8249.90]  successfully taking cooler master,
[8250.06 --> 8254.00]  Corsair and cool it systems to court and winning last year.
[8254.08 --> 8256.04]  When they were unable to get a patent extension,
[8256.16 --> 8259.10]  their stock price dropped 40% in one day.
[8259.44 --> 8261.54]  And if you have a look at their stock price over the last year,
[8261.60 --> 8263.08]  it's rough.
[8263.44 --> 8265.18]  Things are looking so bad for Ace attack.
[8265.18 --> 8266.62]  They might be getting acquired soon,
[8266.72 --> 8267.28]  which is an ouch.
[8267.92 --> 8270.66]  This could potentially lead to a bunch of innovation in the cooling space though,
[8270.72 --> 8273.12]  or at least just price drops in the AIO cooler market,
[8273.24 --> 8279.88]  because any company can now make a CPU cooler with the pump and the cold plate integrated and do whatever they want with it.
[8280.12 --> 8281.92]  It'll probably just lead to cheaper coolers though,
[8282.00 --> 8284.60]  which is also cool.
[8284.60 --> 8287.76]  What else we got this week?
[8288.32 --> 8289.26]  Oh my goodness.
[8289.38 --> 8289.82]  There's so many.
[8289.94 --> 8290.12]  Okay.
[8290.28 --> 8291.46]  EB games back from the dead.
[8291.54 --> 8292.86]  I thought I said no for this topic.
[8293.00 --> 8294.30]  That may have been a misclick.
[8294.42 --> 8294.76]  Sorry.
[8295.28 --> 8296.26]  Whoever prepped that.
[8296.36 --> 8297.06]  I'm so sorry.
[8297.48 --> 8300.10]  GameStop Canada is becoming EB games again or something.
[8300.78 --> 8301.22]  Oh,
[8301.90 --> 8303.48]  delete me.
[8303.56 --> 8306.86]  A sponsor we've worked with in the past gets mildly controversied.
[8306.86 --> 8314.74]  A privacy focused YouTuber named reject convenience released a video titled what delete me and incogni aren't telling you.
[8314.80 --> 8317.54]  And it has received some attention from the YouTube slash tech community.
[8317.74 --> 8318.72]  It's actually a great video.
[8318.80 --> 8319.64]  Y'all should go watch it.
[8319.78 --> 8322.30]  The video dives into how your data is collected.
[8322.42 --> 8322.94]  I thought it was good too.
[8323.10 --> 8331.16]  Who holds it and the difficulty involved in trying to remove that information and the limitations on services like delete me and incogni.
[8331.58 --> 8336.60]  Reject convenience emphasizes the importance of understanding these technologies and their limitations.
[8336.60 --> 8341.92]  And criticizes the talking points that these services provide to creators considering them to be misleading.
[8342.92 --> 8346.90]  And says that the services may not be a good value for most people.
[8347.38 --> 8352.94]  The YouTuber also reiterates that we really need more robust privacy laws that protect our personal information.
[8353.20 --> 8354.20]  And we need them soon.
[8354.54 --> 8355.54]  Speak to your representatives.
[8356.28 --> 8359.66]  Delete me and incogni have both provided positive responses to the video.
[8359.96 --> 8362.46]  Which reject convenience has posted on his blog.
[8362.94 --> 8363.20]  Again,
[8363.28 --> 8363.90]  Go watch the video.
[8363.98 --> 8364.72]  It's really well made.
[8364.72 --> 8365.24]  Also,
[8365.34 --> 8366.76]  apparently we got a subtle shout out.
[8367.44 --> 8371.36]  Using delete me has actually made noticeable improvements for me as a public facing creator.
[8371.48 --> 8374.04]  I've actually seen a reduction in spam calls since using the service.
[8374.26 --> 8377.36]  And it does make it that much more difficult to find my personal information.
[8377.48 --> 8378.72]  If anyone really put their mind to it,
[8378.78 --> 8380.98]  I'm sure they could find more about me than I even want to think about.
[8381.26 --> 8383.96]  But often just making something a little more difficult makes people less likely to do it.
[8384.00 --> 8384.56]  It says Adam.
[8385.04 --> 8385.24]  Oh,
[8385.30 --> 8385.42]  okay.
[8385.42 --> 8386.10]  That was from Adam.
[8386.32 --> 8387.28]  That was from the video.
[8387.30 --> 8387.42]  Yeah,
[8387.42 --> 8388.60]  I thought it was from the video as well.
[8388.64 --> 8388.82]  I was like,
[8388.84 --> 8389.48]  I don't remember this.
[8389.90 --> 8390.18]  Uh,
[8390.22 --> 8390.56]  okay.
[8390.56 --> 8392.90]  Oh,
[8392.98 --> 8393.26]  okay.
[8393.92 --> 8394.28]  Interesting.
[8396.24 --> 8396.82]  I should.
[8399.18 --> 8399.54]  Okay.
[8399.72 --> 8399.96]  Yeah,
[8400.02 --> 8400.90]  we should come up with a way.
[8401.02 --> 8402.80]  He did actually put a paragraph break there.
[8402.90 --> 8403.46]  So there,
[8403.56 --> 8403.72]  yeah,
[8403.88 --> 8406.04]  we should have realized that that was just Adam's notes.
[8406.04 --> 8408.10]  All right.
[8408.48 --> 8408.88]  Um,
[8409.08 --> 8409.26]  oh,
[8409.28 --> 8413.02]  our discussion question here is what steps is Linus media group taking to ensure that our
[8413.02 --> 8415.24]  sponsor talking points for delete me are,
[8415.24 --> 8415.86]  uh,
[8415.86 --> 8417.68]  fully representative of the product going forward.
[8417.80 --> 8420.64]  We've already worked with them on revising the talking points and we're going to make
[8420.64 --> 8423.14]  sure that we get that sorted out for you guys.
[8424.72 --> 8425.24]  All right.
[8425.26 --> 8426.30]  What else we got here?
[8426.42 --> 8427.52]  We can leave out who's dead.
[8428.14 --> 8428.54]  Yeah.
[8428.92 --> 8429.32]  Okay.
[8429.32 --> 8429.72]  It's died.
[8430.28 --> 8432.08]  22 years after the launch Skype is dead.
[8432.16 --> 8432.42]  Cool.
[8432.88 --> 8433.98]  That was a short topic.
[8434.24 --> 8435.46]  We should upload that one as a clip.
[8436.42 --> 8436.90]  Uh,
[8436.92 --> 8442.68]  we have some deets about the ROG ally to photos and specs of two pre-production models of
[8442.68 --> 8448.08]  the new ROG and Xbox co-branded ally twos have leaked from an Indonesian certification
[8448.08 --> 8450.28]  office and FCC listing.
[8450.52 --> 8453.20]  Looks like we're getting the same one 20 Hertz LCD screen,
[8453.40 --> 8458.56]  a new shape reminiscent of the PS portal with full controller grips and a fairly significant
[8458.56 --> 8461.08]  bump in performance for the higher end model.
[8461.34 --> 8461.78]  Uh,
[8461.78 --> 8464.46]  specs we know with fairly high certainty.
[8464.46 --> 8465.42]  Um,
[8465.42 --> 8466.18]  so here's a little,
[8466.38 --> 8466.70]  uh,
[8466.88 --> 8467.80]  here's the little table.
[8468.42 --> 8469.38]  Let's go.
[8469.66 --> 8470.54]  Here's the black version.
[8471.00 --> 8471.86]  35 watts.
[8472.06 --> 8472.24]  Whoa.
[8472.66 --> 8472.96]  Whoa.
[8473.28 --> 8473.90]  Zen five.
[8474.06 --> 8474.54]  Zen five.
[8474.62 --> 8475.04]  Let's go.
[8475.26 --> 8476.38]  Radio on 890 M.
[8476.54 --> 8477.28]  Let's go.
[8477.94 --> 8480.90]  Similar to an AMD HX370 with four CPUs disabled.
[8481.02 --> 8481.94]  Pretty impressive benchmarks.
[8482.08 --> 8483.38]  You can find the benchmarks,
[8483.48 --> 8483.80]  uh,
[8483.80 --> 8484.06]  elsewhere.
[8484.06 --> 8487.78]  We still don't know when they're coming for how much or how tightly integrated the Xbox
[8487.78 --> 8490.42]  functionality will be.
[8490.60 --> 8491.06]  All right.
[8491.10 --> 8491.86]  That's it for topics.
[8491.94 --> 8493.56]  It's time for after dark.
[8494.68 --> 8495.00]  Yes.
[8496.42 --> 8497.46]  More like after dork.
[8497.52 --> 8498.02]  I think we just,
[8498.02 --> 8499.34]  I think we,
[8499.42 --> 8500.70]  I think we surprised him with that one.
[8500.74 --> 8501.36]  It's going to take a second.
[8502.18 --> 8502.82]  Now he's got it.
[8503.22 --> 8503.72]  I believe it.
[8503.72 --> 8504.30]  He's a professional.
[8504.52 --> 8504.84]  Let's watch him.
[8504.88 --> 8505.12]  I'm just saying,
[8505.18 --> 8505.70]  I'm just buying him some time.
[8505.70 --> 8506.36]  It's already after dark.
[8506.44 --> 8506.60]  Boom.
[8506.70 --> 8506.90]  Got him.
[8506.90 --> 8507.04]  Yeah.
[8507.30 --> 8507.50]  Yeah.
[8507.74 --> 8507.90]  Boom.
[8507.98 --> 8508.26]  Got him.
[8508.68 --> 8508.92]  All right.
[8509.86 --> 8510.64]  How dare you?
[8510.68 --> 8515.14]  I was in the middle of messaging Chewie to turn that into a LMG clip.
[8515.78 --> 8517.82]  How dare you doubt this man?
[8518.30 --> 8519.68]  I didn't doubt him.
[8519.86 --> 8522.76]  This man is doing so much for the WAN show.
[8522.84 --> 8523.90]  Now you're just being patronizing.
[8523.92 --> 8525.36]  Has done so much for my reputation.
[8525.36 --> 8526.24]  Luke has to go home.
[8526.24 --> 8528.74]  Just because you have social awkwardness issues does not mean.
[8528.74 --> 8530.70]  He made sure people would not think I'm mean.
[8530.72 --> 8532.22]  Does not mean that that interaction was bad.
[8532.28 --> 8533.42]  Now he's just being mean.
[8533.82 --> 8534.00]  All right.
[8534.02 --> 8534.88]  Take everything I say back.
[8534.92 --> 8535.42]  I hate it here.
[8535.42 --> 8539.42]  Wow.
[8541.26 --> 8542.36]  That sniff was synchronized.
[8542.60 --> 8543.46]  Oh, sorry.
[8543.66 --> 8544.24]  Very cool.
[8544.90 --> 8546.44]  I'm really not feeling a hundred percent.
[8546.58 --> 8547.94]  Oh, I should have given you a heads up today.
[8547.98 --> 8548.70]  I totally forgot.
[8549.38 --> 8549.64]  Okay.
[8549.72 --> 8550.94]  Well, I'm not feeling a hundred percent.
[8551.06 --> 8552.46]  At least he's not leaving the country.
[8553.84 --> 8554.24]  Yeah.
[8554.30 --> 8554.60]  Right.
[8554.98 --> 8557.50]  It would be pretty funny if Luke got sick on a trip again.
[8558.94 --> 8559.34]  Cool.
[8559.86 --> 8560.62]  Every time.
[8560.72 --> 8561.30]  Every time.
[8561.50 --> 8562.00]  Every time.
[8562.46 --> 8562.82]  Okay.
[8562.82 --> 8566.10]  Well, congratulations on being sick.
[8566.52 --> 8566.82]  Thanks.
[8566.92 --> 8567.12]  Now.
[8567.38 --> 8567.86]  That's good.
[8567.98 --> 8568.40]  Or later.
[8568.96 --> 8569.12]  Later.
[8569.12 --> 8570.26]  But like not very much later.
[8570.46 --> 8574.02]  Probably like right when I get there.
[8575.82 --> 8576.26]  Cool.
[8577.04 --> 8579.42]  For what it's worth, I think it's bacterial.
[8579.66 --> 8582.68]  So if I had antibiotics, I'd probably be better by now.
[8582.76 --> 8584.22]  But I didn't really bother.
[8584.74 --> 8586.54]  Didn't want to get those the same way as last time.
[8586.54 --> 8592.52]  I haven't really, I don't think I've acknowledged that publicly how I got those drugs.
[8592.74 --> 8593.08]  Have I?
[8593.30 --> 8593.70]  No.
[8593.96 --> 8594.22]  Okay.
[8594.38 --> 8594.52]  Cool.
[8596.66 --> 8600.76]  There's ways to get drugs that are not a doctor.
[8601.42 --> 8601.86]  Stealing.
[8601.94 --> 8602.96]  There's all kinds of doctors.
[8603.44 --> 8603.68]  Yeah.
[8603.82 --> 8604.12]  Yeah.
[8604.24 --> 8605.94]  There's lots of different kinds of doctors.
[8606.10 --> 8607.48]  You know, they got all kinds of doctors.
[8609.18 --> 8609.68]  All right.
[8609.70 --> 8610.38]  What are we talking about?
[8610.38 --> 8614.20]  Love the recent video on DIY batteries.
[8614.40 --> 8617.94]  Of all the projects you and the team have worked on, which one made you gain the most
[8617.94 --> 8621.40]  quote unquote, unexpectedly useful knowledge and skills?
[8621.72 --> 8623.22]  Stuff that you end up using a lot.
[8624.12 --> 8627.10]  Oh, man.
[8627.32 --> 8634.44]  There's so many videos now that I have a really, really hard time like coming up with a video
[8634.44 --> 8635.54]  sometimes.
[8636.18 --> 8639.54]  One where I gained skills unexpectedly.
[8640.38 --> 8640.92]  Oh, boy.
[8641.30 --> 8642.20]  Unexpectedly useful.
[8642.60 --> 8645.06]  Not that you gained the skill unexpectedly.
[8645.20 --> 8645.50]  Yeah.
[8645.56 --> 8648.82]  But the skill ended up being useful in the rest of your life and you did not expect it.
[8649.82 --> 8651.84]  Maybe that helps, but I doubt it.
[8652.64 --> 8653.04]  Yeah.
[8654.68 --> 8655.12]  Wow.
[8655.12 --> 8656.60]  I mean, yeah.
[8657.60 --> 8658.68]  That's cool, though.
[8659.60 --> 8660.08]  Cool message.
[8660.26 --> 8661.12]  I mean, here's one.
[8661.30 --> 8661.50]  Yeah.
[8661.62 --> 8662.28]  Here's one.
[8662.64 --> 8662.98]  Okay.
[8663.26 --> 8665.84]  I'm going to get my license to drive the fire truck.
[8665.94 --> 8666.44]  Are you actually?
[8666.76 --> 8667.04]  Yeah.
[8667.30 --> 8669.96]  It turns out it's not that bad.
[8669.96 --> 8670.46]  Yeah.
[8670.68 --> 8674.44]  You just have to get like the air brake certification.
[8674.58 --> 8678.80]  You don't actually have to get like a class three because it's only dual axle.
[8679.52 --> 8679.92]  Yeah.
[8680.08 --> 8681.90]  So it's like really not that bad.
[8682.26 --> 8685.18]  Apparently, we thought it was going to be like a 20 hour course, but it's like a one
[8685.18 --> 8685.58]  day thing.
[8685.68 --> 8692.06]  So I think me and the Alex's and anyone else who wants to do it are going to do it at the
[8692.06 --> 8692.44]  same time.
[8692.44 --> 8693.84]  So I haven't seen this.
[8693.98 --> 8696.44]  I haven't seen it on the schedule yet, but we're going to do it pretty quick.
[8696.86 --> 8696.96]  Cool.
[8697.18 --> 8702.08]  So that's that's something I unexpectedly am going to learn, but I didn't like learn it
[8702.08 --> 8702.72]  from that.
[8703.84 --> 8704.24]  You know what?
[8704.56 --> 8705.66]  I'm standing by it.
[8706.08 --> 8706.42]  All right.
[8706.54 --> 8706.86]  Hit me.
[8707.50 --> 8708.26]  Sure thing.
[8708.26 --> 8714.42]  What has been the most unexpected piece of feedback or insight you've gained from your
[8714.42 --> 8716.96]  audience that influenced your approach to creating content?
[8717.42 --> 8718.80]  So many unexpected things.
[8718.96 --> 8719.18]  Yeah.
[8719.32 --> 8721.00]  I didn't realize they were all this today.
[8721.34 --> 8721.64]  Yeah.
[8722.32 --> 8725.12]  It's an unexpected piece of feedback or insight.
[8725.12 --> 8735.16]  I think something that changed our approach over the last 10 years or so was realizing how
[8735.16 --> 8741.90]  important the role of this oasis where we can just talk about and think about tech was
[8741.90 --> 8742.38]  for people.
[8743.12 --> 8749.38]  I think that there have been times when we have delved into other issues that people have
[8749.38 --> 8754.36]  just told us point blank, not because they sit on one side of the issue or the other side
[8754.36 --> 8759.38]  of the issue or whatever, but have just told us like, hey, you guys are my respite from
[8759.38 --> 8763.70]  thinking about everything that's going on in the world right now, whether it's then or
[8763.70 --> 8764.40]  now or whatever.
[8765.00 --> 8765.84]  And can we just not?
[8766.16 --> 8771.80]  And I guess that one's top of mind for me, because there's been a lot more of that feedback
[8771.80 --> 8778.14]  lately as we've engaged in conversation on the changes from the recent U.S. administration
[8778.14 --> 8779.98]  with respect to import tariffs.
[8779.98 --> 8789.42]  And I think the thing that's really tough is when people say, hey, can you not talk about
[8789.42 --> 8789.88]  politics?
[8790.28 --> 8795.58]  It's like, well, it's kind of hard to avoid sometimes.
[8795.78 --> 8801.98]  You know, it's like when we're talking about net neutrality or right to repair or, hey, all
[8801.98 --> 8803.84]  your s*** is going to cost way more.
[8803.84 --> 8810.26]  Um, those are not in my mind sometimes political conversations.
[8810.26 --> 8812.32]  They're just some facts.
[8812.78 --> 8819.66]  Um, but over time, more and more things feel like they are becoming politicized.
[8819.80 --> 8821.06]  If that makes sense.
[8821.20 --> 8821.48]  Oh, yeah.
[8821.52 --> 8824.96]  It's not because they're inherently, inherently political.
[8825.18 --> 8830.84]  Even like liking a certain activity that has deeply nothing to do with politics is politicized.
[8830.84 --> 8831.92]  Sure.
[8832.14 --> 8834.92]  Like going to the shooting range, for instance.
[8835.10 --> 8835.42]  Sure.
[8836.54 --> 8837.54]  I could see that.
[8838.54 --> 8841.86]  It can even be like more chill than that.
[8842.08 --> 8843.92]  Like liking a certain type of sport.
[8844.64 --> 8844.82]  Really?
[8845.06 --> 8845.32]  Yeah.
[8846.38 --> 8846.72]  Ugh.
[8848.42 --> 8849.36]  It's pretty wild.
[8849.44 --> 8849.94]  That's lame.
[8850.50 --> 8851.46]  It's not cool.
[8851.90 --> 8852.14]  No.
[8852.50 --> 8852.76]  No.
[8853.00 --> 8853.98]  I've not chilled with it.
[8854.22 --> 8854.44]  Yeah.
[8855.20 --> 8857.70]  I just want to, I just want my tech videos.
[8858.04 --> 8858.24]  Yeah.
[8858.24 --> 8862.46]  So I'm basically, I'm trying to say, I hear you loud and clear and we try, but there are
[8862.46 --> 8867.74]  situations where, you know, when you've got a particular political party that is like
[8867.74 --> 8871.66]  not doing anything useful for right to repair or obstructing it or whatever.
[8872.44 --> 8875.00]  Um, or, you know, he's not even calling one out.
[8875.14 --> 8876.24]  That just happens on both sides.
[8876.24 --> 8876.34]  Yeah.
[8876.34 --> 8877.82]  That's, that's a very both sides thing.
[8877.88 --> 8879.08]  I intentionally chose that.
[8879.16 --> 8879.30]  Yeah.
[8879.30 --> 8884.90]  Um, then like we have real, or when you have a particular side that is, you know, not handling
[8884.90 --> 8890.50]  privacy very well, or is enacting like super stupid legislation that's objectively stupid
[8890.50 --> 8894.08]  and we can all just agree is stupid if we're not being brainwashed.
[8894.68 --> 8897.24]  Um, then we've got to call that out, right?
[8897.26 --> 8899.76]  Like that's, that's, that's how democracy works.
[8899.76 --> 8905.44]  That's the whole point is that regardless of what team, you know, and they're on my team
[8905.44 --> 8909.20]  or they're on your team or whatever, regardless of what team someone's on, we're supposed to
[8909.20 --> 8916.30]  be able to call it out when it's like, oh yeah, our solution to, uh, gatekeeping, um, explicit
[8916.30 --> 8923.82]  content online is to create a giant honeypot of everyone's personal information in a super
[8923.82 --> 8925.16]  unsecured way.
[8925.28 --> 8929.42]  It's like, well, no, that's objectively a bad idea and we should push back on it no
[8929.42 --> 8930.54]  matter who's in charge.
[8930.54 --> 8930.80]  Right.
[8931.32 --> 8934.90]  So, but I, I just feel like there's less and less room for that.
[8935.10 --> 8939.00]  I don't know why this whole thing, like just somewhere to not talk about politics or whatever
[8939.00 --> 8942.38]  made me think of this, but I, every once in a while I think about threads like this
[8942.38 --> 8942.90]  on the forum.
[8943.90 --> 8948.68]  Um, yeah, this thread has almost 60,000 replies.
[8948.82 --> 8949.82]  It's 11 years old.
[8949.82 --> 8953.64]  It's at the point now where it's actually like costing significant amounts to like store the
[8953.64 --> 8954.52]  data for it.
[8955.18 --> 8956.78]  Not that measurable amounts.
[8956.90 --> 8957.56]  How about measurable?
[8957.88 --> 8958.74]  We could measure it.
[8959.14 --> 8959.90]  Someone could.
[8960.26 --> 8960.68]  Someone could.
[8960.76 --> 8961.10]  We won't.
[8961.28 --> 8961.78]  Wouldn't be worth it.
[8961.88 --> 8962.04]  Yeah.
[8962.80 --> 8968.70]  Um, but yeah, and it's just, I mean, you look at the rules and it's just like, I don't
[8968.70 --> 8974.30]  know, do the thing that makes sense for this post is number one and number two.
[8974.42 --> 8975.46]  Number three is have fun.
[8975.50 --> 8977.08]  And number four is just keep it civil.
[8977.08 --> 8978.12]  And it's like, cool.
[8979.10 --> 8979.58]  Nice.
[8979.76 --> 8982.08]  That last one is becoming harder and harder.
[8982.44 --> 8982.94]  It is.
[8983.64 --> 8985.82]  But just have fun and keep it fun.
[8985.96 --> 8986.54]  And that's the rules.
[8986.64 --> 8987.04]  Keep it fun.
[8989.38 --> 8990.18]  All right, Dan.
[8990.32 --> 8990.66]  Hit me.
[8990.72 --> 8992.66]  Can you have maybe not a downer this time?
[8993.14 --> 8993.78]  Can you do that?
[8994.10 --> 8995.54]  Linus, what's an unexpected?
[8995.80 --> 8996.26]  Oh, no, wait.
[8997.94 --> 8999.98]  Hey, um, sure.
[9000.02 --> 9000.76]  This one's not a downer.
[9000.84 --> 9001.34]  Hey, LLD.
[9001.64 --> 9004.42]  Linus, you often announce things with a sing-songy way.
[9004.68 --> 9006.38]  Where do you think you picked that up from?
[9006.38 --> 9009.60]  I think that's pretty normal.
[9009.60 --> 9010.60]  Sing-songy.
[9011.56 --> 9013.54]  Or song-songy.
[9013.90 --> 9014.28]  Yeah.
[9014.50 --> 9015.30]  Song-songy.
[9015.60 --> 9017.28]  The song-songy way.
[9018.32 --> 9019.98]  Uh, I don't know.
[9020.10 --> 9021.60]  I never really thought about it.
[9021.96 --> 9023.62]  I did sing as a child.
[9023.62 --> 9032.10]  Uh, I am good enough to know that I suck, so I don't often sing, but I am capable of
[9032.10 --> 9033.18]  it a little bit.
[9033.40 --> 9036.82]  So maybe it's a thing that I do, just naturally.
[9037.82 --> 9042.44]  Maybe I had some childhood influence that I never noticed.
[9042.72 --> 9046.08]  I truthfully have not really thought about it at all.
[9046.10 --> 9046.98]  I think it's pretty normal.
[9047.58 --> 9048.46]  Okay, cool.
[9049.46 --> 9049.90]  Yeah.
[9051.12 --> 9053.46]  There's no way I'm doing any singing right now.
[9053.72 --> 9055.04]  I have a sore throat.
[9058.40 --> 9059.24]  He's not listening.
[9059.34 --> 9059.62]  That's good.
[9059.74 --> 9060.50]  Okay, Dan, hit me.
[9061.94 --> 9063.50]  Uh, hello, Linus.
[9063.54 --> 9065.46]  I'm trying to resist buying a motorcycle.
[9065.72 --> 9066.08]  Don't.
[9066.08 --> 9067.48]  What got you into it?
[9067.50 --> 9068.20]  Don't resist it.
[9068.22 --> 9069.96]  How do you stay safe on the road?
[9070.54 --> 9071.68]  And how does Yvonne feel about it?
[9071.68 --> 9072.54]  All the gear, all the time.
[9072.58 --> 9073.24]  Yvonne hates it.
[9074.94 --> 9077.50]  Um, oh, by the way, speaking of motorcycles.
[9078.20 --> 9078.96]  You're not done yet.
[9079.46 --> 9083.10]  Speaking of motorcycles, are you ready to lose?
[9083.28 --> 9084.20]  I know you're not done yet.
[9084.74 --> 9086.04]  Are you ready to lose, though?
[9086.16 --> 9088.06]  If you aren't done, I haven't lost yet.
[9088.82 --> 9090.08]  Uh, okay, hold on a second.
[9090.08 --> 9092.62]  I gotta, I gotta, I gotta send a thing to Dan.
[9092.72 --> 9094.10]  I gotta send a thing to Dan real quick.
[9094.10 --> 9094.66]  He's not done yet.
[9094.66 --> 9098.84]  I have to send a thing to Dan.
[9098.84 --> 9099.52]  He's not done yet.
[9099.96 --> 9100.98]  Ah, how do I do this?
[9100.98 --> 9101.70]  I'm not even concerned.
[9102.20 --> 9103.02]  Share, hold on.
[9104.08 --> 9105.12]  Share with Daniel Besser.
[9105.12 --> 9106.76]  Just email it to Infra.
[9108.04 --> 9110.54]  That is not what I'm going to do.
[9110.84 --> 9111.26]  Good.
[9111.58 --> 9112.64]  That is not happening.
[9114.12 --> 9114.96]  Walked into it.
[9115.04 --> 9115.94]  Also rude.
[9116.94 --> 9117.42]  Rude.
[9117.42 --> 9118.12]  I'm not mean.
[9118.66 --> 9120.50]  Uh, just this one.
[9120.60 --> 9120.78]  Yep.
[9121.52 --> 9122.64]  I do have one more.
[9122.96 --> 9124.36]  Oh, this is just a different angle.
[9124.48 --> 9126.02]  Actually, this is a better angle, but whatever.
[9126.24 --> 9126.62]  Okay, fine.
[9126.82 --> 9127.96]  I'm sharing this to Daniel Besser.
[9128.96 --> 9129.18]  Okay.
[9129.98 --> 9130.34]  Uh.
[9130.90 --> 9131.70]  You want both of those?
[9132.66 --> 9133.10]  Uh.
[9133.88 --> 9134.56]  Oh, man.
[9134.66 --> 9136.38]  I found a third angle that's like the best one.
[9136.42 --> 9136.70]  Yeah, yeah.
[9136.70 --> 9137.54]  Just use the second one.
[9138.40 --> 9138.64]  Okay.
[9140.64 --> 9141.80]  Drum roll, please.
[9141.80 --> 9144.78]  He's not done yet.
[9145.00 --> 9145.66]  Bum, bum, bum, bum.
[9146.46 --> 9147.24]  He's not done yet.
[9147.24 --> 9147.92]  Ooh, but.
[9148.64 --> 9149.60]  Hey, progress.
[9150.26 --> 9151.00]  That is nice progress.
[9151.12 --> 9152.26]  It's starting to look pretty good.
[9152.34 --> 9153.04]  That's progress.
[9153.50 --> 9155.14]  It's definitely not even everywhere.
[9155.62 --> 9156.28]  Uh, hold on.
[9156.32 --> 9157.10]  Part of that is the light.
[9157.24 --> 9158.62]  And part of that is uneven.
[9160.62 --> 9166.22]  So, I went hard mode and used like a candy style coating,
[9166.50 --> 9171.62]  which I have discovered is pretty much impossible to coat evenly.
[9171.80 --> 9176.46]  On something as irregularly shaped as a lot of pieces of a motorbike.
[9176.66 --> 9177.10]  That makes sense.
[9177.16 --> 9181.82]  Some of the more uniform pieces, I've actually got it reasonably uniform.
[9183.04 --> 9184.64]  The wheels are going to be horrible.
[9184.76 --> 9185.58]  Don't look at the wheels.
[9186.26 --> 9190.58]  There's a fleck, like right on the top of the gas tank that I'm so upset about.
[9191.58 --> 9196.24]  Like a little piece of dried paint that was on some of my masking tape
[9196.24 --> 9200.28]  to keep paint out of the gas tank came off and landed there.
[9200.28 --> 9201.68]  And it's like a little white spot.
[9201.76 --> 9204.66]  It's like right on the top, like right under where I'm going to be looking at all the time.
[9204.78 --> 9205.38]  I'm so upset.
[9205.60 --> 9206.90]  And there's nothing I can do now.
[9207.06 --> 9209.26]  I would have to completely blast it again.
[9209.82 --> 9210.50]  Prime it again.
[9210.86 --> 9211.42]  White again.
[9211.58 --> 9212.02]  Pink again.
[9212.12 --> 9212.42]  Like it's not.
[9212.50 --> 9213.02]  No, it's not happening.
[9213.02 --> 9218.12]  At this point, I'm just accepting whatever result I get.
[9218.62 --> 9220.28]  So make of that what you will.
[9222.58 --> 9226.36]  So it's going to look pretty bad is what I've kind of come around to.
[9227.18 --> 9231.80]  And I'm going to ride it anyway because sunk cost fallacy goes hard.
[9233.24 --> 9235.78]  Anyway, yeah, motorcycle.
[9235.98 --> 9236.58]  Lots of fun.
[9236.72 --> 9238.50]  It's a totally different experience from driving.
[9238.50 --> 9243.44]  There are definitely things about it that are more dangerous, like the fact that if you get in an accident, you're dead.
[9244.62 --> 9251.18]  But there are things about it that, in my opinion, make it, if you are a very attentive and defensive rider,
[9251.58 --> 9254.64]  make it easier to avoid getting into an accident.
[9254.76 --> 9255.76]  You are more nimble.
[9256.10 --> 9257.52]  You have bigger buffer zones.
[9257.58 --> 9258.80]  I'd say that's the bigger thing.
[9259.22 --> 9262.78]  I mistakenly said once on the WAN show that you can brake faster on a bike.
[9262.88 --> 9263.70]  It feels like it.
[9263.76 --> 9265.22]  Apparently, you can't and it's physics.
[9265.22 --> 9267.18]  So I'm like, OK, that's good to know.
[9267.90 --> 9278.42]  But what you definitely can do is have more buffer space so you can position yourself so that you have a bigger cushion side to side from other vehicles.
[9279.02 --> 9285.36]  You can, if you are braking, you can go beside something to buy yourself a little bit of extra space.
[9285.48 --> 9289.56]  Sometimes, not always, because if you're braking hard, you cannot steer while you're braking on a motorbike.
[9289.56 --> 9299.50]  Like, J2134 says, it's literally the most unsafe form of transportation.
[9299.68 --> 9299.78]  OK.
[9300.10 --> 9300.84]  Yeah, fair enough.
[9301.98 --> 9303.18]  But, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[9303.20 --> 9304.26]  I'm not talking about lane splitting.
[9304.34 --> 9305.02]  I don't lane split.
[9305.68 --> 9310.58]  And that is a very good way to be in trouble and get dead.
[9310.58 --> 9315.48]  Anyway, what got me into it was my dad used to take me on his bike and it was awesome.
[9315.66 --> 9316.26]  I don't know.
[9316.36 --> 9323.56]  It's like wind, you know, going past you and like the, you know, the gear and the, I don't know, man.
[9323.62 --> 9325.98]  I'm not much of a petrol head when it comes to cars.
[9326.12 --> 9331.12]  I literally just want my car to be as quiet as possible and just like quiet zoom zoom machine.
[9331.12 --> 9334.00]  I drive electric and I love it.
[9334.38 --> 9338.40]  But like something about the motorbike, I test drove an electric bike and it sucked.
[9338.58 --> 9339.58]  Just soulless.
[9339.68 --> 9341.18]  I love the, I love the sound of the bike.
[9342.20 --> 9342.44]  Yep.
[9343.40 --> 9343.76]  Bike.
[9344.90 --> 9345.20]  Vroom, vroom.
[9346.80 --> 9348.08]  Hi, LTT guys.
[9348.46 --> 9352.88]  Why didn't you include pre-built systems from the likes of Micro Center, Memory Express, etc.
[9353.06 --> 9354.18]  in Secret Shopper?
[9354.28 --> 9355.02]  It's a good question.
[9355.50 --> 9360.14]  We just don't really think of them as system integrators and we haven't included them.
[9360.14 --> 9361.22]  And it's arbitrary.
[9363.00 --> 9364.78]  Yeah, that's a very good question.
[9364.88 --> 9365.68]  We very well could.
[9365.80 --> 9367.38]  We just, we just didn't.
[9367.98 --> 9371.20]  Micro Center would be a little tougher because we'd probably have to go in person, I would think.
[9371.68 --> 9374.08]  Like we're not American, so that's tougher.
[9376.72 --> 9383.64]  To all three of you, do you think Canada will bring home Lord Stanley's Cup this year?
[9383.76 --> 9385.84]  And which team do you think has the best shot?
[9385.84 --> 9392.10]  I was Oilers going into it just because I feel like they got robbed last year.
[9394.08 --> 9401.22]  And I really want, I really want, I think there's, you got a core with that kind of talent.
[9401.36 --> 9403.98]  You just got to like, you kind of kind of look at it and go like, come on.
[9404.08 --> 9405.60]  Like you got, there's no way.
[9405.68 --> 9406.22]  Like they got it.
[9406.22 --> 9412.10]  But man, have you seen that Winnipeg Jets come back?
[9412.80 --> 9413.76]  I've been watching it.
[9417.10 --> 9419.00]  I don't know what's happening over there.
[9419.20 --> 9424.22]  Dude, I mean, I, I, I, it just, it makes you want to root for them.
[9424.22 --> 9434.92]  The fact that they staved off elimination with 1.6 seconds left and then managed to, managed to get it done in double overtime.
[9435.26 --> 9438.78]  Like, how can you not, how can you not root for these people?
[9439.28 --> 9441.12]  How can you not root for them?
[9441.26 --> 9442.80]  It's the love of the game right there, man.
[9443.62 --> 9447.26]  Um, man, it looked like they had nothing going on.
[9447.32 --> 9448.28]  Like they weren't set up at all.
[9448.34 --> 9453.22]  That pass, that is like one of the most heads up plays that I have ever seen ever.
[9454.22 --> 9455.68]  Just getting it across.
[9455.84 --> 9457.04]  He could have just shot again.
[9457.16 --> 9458.34]  He could have just shot again.
[9458.54 --> 9461.62]  It's been like a few years of really good hockey.
[9461.64 --> 9462.98]  Like 500 IQ.
[9463.60 --> 9464.72]  Like, dude.
[9465.64 --> 9465.84]  Oh.
[9466.34 --> 9467.34]  It's been a good time.
[9467.90 --> 9468.14]  Yeah.
[9470.06 --> 9471.14]  Speaking of a good time.
[9472.80 --> 9477.36]  And dude, oh man, I didn't, I didn't catch the entire game, but I was like at a sports bar eating dinner last night.
[9477.36 --> 9480.30]  And I caught like the first five minutes of the Oilers game.
[9480.52 --> 9483.78]  And like right off the opening face off.
[9484.78 --> 9485.72]  End to end.
[9486.06 --> 9487.08]  Just nonstop.
[9487.16 --> 9488.22]  I actually don't know who won that.
[9488.32 --> 9489.10]  I should probably check.
[9491.40 --> 9492.58]  I am Vycus.
[9494.60 --> 9494.96]  Oilers.
[9495.12 --> 9496.12]  5-4.
[9496.82 --> 9497.26]  Dang.
[9497.48 --> 9498.26]  That's a high scoring game.
[9498.28 --> 9499.14]  That's a super high.
[9499.20 --> 9503.86]  Well, from the little bit of that I saw, I'm not surprised.
[9503.86 --> 9511.38]  Like, I'm sure the first thing that both coaches said at the first like TV timeout was, yo, everybody settle the f*** down.
[9511.88 --> 9514.20]  Because there's just, who needs defense?
[9514.42 --> 9514.62]  Yeah.
[9514.76 --> 9515.32]  Just go.
[9516.42 --> 9516.86]  Anyway.
[9516.86 --> 9516.94]  Anyway.
[9517.58 --> 9518.10]  All right.
[9519.04 --> 9520.74]  Anyway, good luck for everyone else's team.
[9520.78 --> 9521.68]  I guess no one else answered.
[9523.64 --> 9525.28]  Oh, apparently Winnipeg's killing it tonight.
[9525.72 --> 9525.88]  Sorry.
[9526.08 --> 9527.28]  So who's yours?
[9528.88 --> 9529.50]  I don't know.
[9529.54 --> 9529.86]  Oilers?
[9529.92 --> 9530.54]  I need to go.
[9531.22 --> 9531.80]  Then get out of here.
[9531.84 --> 9532.34]  What are you waiting for?
[9532.88 --> 9533.16]  You.
[9533.78 --> 9534.02]  Oh.
[9534.20 --> 9534.52]  All right.
[9534.56 --> 9535.30]  We'll see you again next week.
[9535.58 --> 9536.40]  Same bad time.
[9536.48 --> 9537.02]  Same bad channel.
