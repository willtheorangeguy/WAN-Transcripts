So idk if Linus will see this comment and I mean zero hate but I saw around the 1 hour 15 min mark that he was talking about the drop in views. Honestly I stopped watching. I am someone who has been watching for so long, years and years and before this channel I was watching on my old channel. The videos have gotten very stale... I tried to watch the hidden desk video and was bored to tears. I also do not like the members only stuff showing up in the channel feed, it's very annoying and pushes me away. Youtube hasn't stopped showed me the channel less, it still pops up on my homepage every single time a new video is uploaded. This isn't a hate comment, more like general feedback that I realize is kinda sloppy said. Another thing I don't really resonate with anymore is the hosts. I think there's so many faces that I don't every feel like I'm in a comfy spot, I don't know how to explain it. Even with WAN I used to watch every second, now I just kinda click around to the timestamps I find interesting. Here's hoping y'all deliver more content that resonates with me!
