[0.00 → 6.80] What's up everyone?
[7.32 → 8.40] Welcome to the WAN Show.
[8.60 → 10.48] We've got a great show lined up for you this week.
[10.82 → 17.50] Because how can Google unilaterally remove my video about ad blockers,
[17.72 → 21.84] but then run ads on YouTube for ad blockers?
[23.12 → 25.28] This does not make sense.
[26.06 → 27.48] This is Chewbacca.
[28.26 → 29.80] Chewbacca lives on Kashyyyk.
[30.78 → 32.28] He does not make sense.
[33.78 → 36.52] Also, in the news this week,
[37.10 → 40.20] Intel's having a bit of a classic Coke moment,
[40.64 → 46.54] where the new Intel CPU is not nearly as beloved as the old Intel CPU
[46.54 → 48.56] that overheats and dies,
[49.00 → 51.86] which is hard to deal with.
[51.98 → 53.24] What else we got this week, Mr. Luke?
[53.76 → 54.24] Oblivion!
[54.82 → 55.84] Oh my god, really?
[55.98 → 58.28] Oblivion happened, it was remastered, Bethesda released it,
[58.28 → 59.74] there's more to talk about other than that,
[59.82 → 62.66] but oh my, oh my goodness.
[63.08 → 64.90] Everyone knew that was going to be a topic of mine.
[65.12 → 67.40] I blew the only one that I had for sure.
[67.88 → 69.10] And other than that, I don't know.
[69.10 → 69.20] Whole load blown.
[69.70 → 71.06] They all kind of suck.
[71.44 → 73.68] Discord CEO is stepping down.
[73.84 → 76.16] Whole load blown because it's like,
[76.26 → 80.26] you know, that reference and also Oblivion with the long loading times.
[80.70 → 81.12] Oh.
[81.12 → 83.76] Loading simulator Oblivion.
[83.94 → 85.24] The loading times are pretty good now.
[91.86 → 92.66] Oh my god.
[92.66 → 111.12] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Squarespace, and Notion,
[111.22 → 112.40] and of course, as usual,
[112.82 → 113.92] our wrap partner, Brand,
[114.10 → 115.36] our laptop partner, Dell,
[115.54 → 118.28] and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[119.02 → 120.00] Let's talk about this.
[120.00 → 125.74] Google is apparently completely cool with ad block advertising on YouTube.
[125.94 → 127.96] Are they cool with it or was it just there?
[128.88 → 135.50] So, you know how when there's like an inflammatory thing that you're reporting on?
[135.70 → 135.98] Yes.
[136.08 → 138.12] Whether you cosplay as a journalist or not,
[138.22 → 141.08] you sort of just have a moral, you might say,
[141.54 → 145.04] obligation to reach out and get the other side of the story.
[145.92 → 146.64] Did we do so?
[146.64 → 149.24] Because that's just kind of basic human decency.
[149.86 → 151.96] I reached out to Google asking,
[152.28 → 159.50] yo, what's the deal with all of these ads that I'm getting for this service called Pi?
[160.50 → 162.98] So this is Pi ad block,
[163.08 → 164.00] which I don't know,
[164.26 → 169.10] is maybe going to get the WAN show freaking take downed by YouTube.
[169.10 → 171.04] Because you might remember this.
[171.38 → 174.64] Recently, we did a video, part two of Google Your Life,
[174.78 → 180.80] where we talked, yes, about the boogeyman ad block and how to use it on YouTube.
[181.16 → 183.24] Okay, so I'm showing this right now.
[183.64 → 186.60] But the only reason I'm aware of Pi, Luke,
[186.86 → 191.94] is because I keep getting fed ads for it on YouTube.
[191.94 → 193.94] And talking to some of the other writers here,
[194.26 → 198.78] they've been apparently getting a lot of ads for Pi as well.
[199.90 → 201.84] So let me, let me, you know what,
[201.86 → 206.22] I'll actually read the document that our writing team so graciously prepared for us.
[207.16 → 209.00] Do you recognize these people?
[209.20 → 210.26] Sorry, what is this?
[211.30 → 212.38] Ah, yes.
[212.52 → 212.92] Okay.
[213.30 → 215.46] Mr. Jordan Block went and did.
[215.54 → 217.28] Look at all this work he did for us.
[217.36 → 217.58] Boom.
[217.58 → 222.04] He's got the people's internet.
[222.20 → 222.96] Yeah, here we go.
[223.34 → 224.14] The people's internet.
[224.36 → 224.60] Okay.
[224.80 → 226.70] So do you recognize any of these ads?
[228.74 → 230.36] These are all ads for Pi.
[230.56 → 230.94] No.
[232.06 → 234.62] Okay, well, I bet you guys do.
[236.28 → 237.94] So far, still, no.
[241.70 → 243.42] The only thing I see is I have YouTube Premium.
[243.48 → 244.14] Oh, for crying out loud.
[244.26 → 245.14] Yeah, I have YouTube Premium.
[245.32 → 246.44] I don't want the...
[246.44 → 248.46] Well, I don't have YouTube Premium on my work account.
[248.48 → 251.18] Are these the people that read ads for everything?
[251.36 → 251.94] Is that the point?
[252.14 → 255.44] Well, those are just like, those are the those are the like the ads for it.
[255.50 → 256.46] Those are the thumbnails for them.
[256.48 → 257.86] How would I recognize the people though?
[257.88 → 260.74] Well, because they're in the ads for the they're in the ads for Pi.
[261.52 → 263.84] Oh, so it's basically asking if I've seen the ad before.
[263.84 → 264.14] Yeah.
[264.32 → 264.56] Yeah.
[264.56 → 266.08] I'm just asking if you've seen the ad before.
[266.38 → 266.74] No.
[266.98 → 267.60] Well, whatever.
[268.18 → 272.82] Honey, Honey co-founder Ryan Hudson is back with a new project.
[272.82 → 274.82] The Pi ad blocker.
[274.82 → 275.08] Ah.
[275.08 → 279.48] Which seems to be advertising absolutely everywhere recently.
[279.48 → 279.80] Of course.
[279.96 → 281.18] Including on YouTube.
[282.00 → 288.34] Google's ad transparency site shows that Pi has approximately 40 different text ads and
[288.34 → 294.04] 800 different video ads active in Google Ads when we checked earlier today.
[294.12 → 294.52] 800.
[294.52 → 298.74] Pi says that you can block ads and get paid.
[299.36 → 305.36] Although the Pi FAQ seems mostly concerned with distancing themselves from Honey slash PayPal.
[306.02 → 314.56] This discovery on my part comes just seven months after Google unilaterally removed our
[314.56 → 320.64] Decouple Your Life part two video for violating YouTube's community guidelines as potentially
[320.64 → 327.48] harmful or dangerous content, which it turns out translates to telling people how to block
[327.48 → 328.84] ads on YouTube.
[329.14 → 337.46] So I reached out to YouTube and by my standards, very politely asked what the f*** is this?
[338.40 → 344.82] Um, I was a little frustrated by the experience to say the least.
[344.82 → 347.28] I basically said, hey, so what's the deal with this?
[347.36 → 353.54] Like, what is the policy distinction between me posting a video talking about ad blocking
[353.54 → 362.18] on YouTube versus an advertiser paying for positioning for their ad blocker on YouTube?
[362.34 → 365.30] And they basically went, oh, well, I don't know.
[365.84 → 369.56] You'll have to get me the ad ID of that ad.
[369.56 → 373.22] And I'm kind of sitting here going, well, what does that even mean?
[373.28 → 374.24] Why does it, why does it matter?
[374.70 → 376.38] Why do you need the ID of the spit?
[376.44 → 379.98] Like, it felt like I was just being asked to jump through a completely unnecessary hoop.
[380.42 → 382.00] This is an ad for an ad blocker.
[382.74 → 384.78] So they have a domain.
[385.80 → 391.42] Presumably you Google, the entity have an ad service that knows what the f*** domain
[391.42 → 396.74] an ad that people click on goes to find one that goes to that domain and let me know.
[397.34 → 397.74] Right.
[397.74 → 399.70] Am I missing something here?
[400.14 → 400.22] No.
[401.02 → 404.06] If it goes to this ad blocker, just find anyone.
[404.22 → 404.74] I don't care.
[404.82 → 406.22] It doesn't have to be the exact one.
[406.30 → 407.88] Why does it, there's an irrelevant detail.
[407.96 → 409.68] Anyway, we jumped through the hoop.
[410.02 → 412.70] Jordan, very helpfully, found me an ID.
[412.90 → 418.04] And also you can see got that helpful little link that shows how many of these flippin' video
[418.04 → 420.72] ads they have running right now, which Google could have easily done.
[420.78 → 425.12] They could have just gone and found that list and then shown me, responded via about any
[425.12 → 425.56] one of them.
[425.56 → 435.14] Basically, so I sent that over to them, and they're kind of like, oh, well, Google's divisions
[435.14 → 436.18] have a lot of separation.
[436.86 → 441.40] So ads have a different set of policies compared to YouTube videos.
[441.40 → 449.08] And there is currently no policy against advertising an ad blocker, even though that ad blocker appears
[449.08 → 452.72] as content on f***ING YouTube.
[452.92 → 460.04] What if, what if, what if, what if you buy ads for the Google your life video?
[460.04 → 463.00] Apparently, that's kosher.
[466.28 → 466.76] What?
[467.16 → 472.18] So making people watch it, it's more okay than having it be optional.
[472.18 → 477.88] If the content is bad, it's more okay if you make people watch it than if you make it optional
[477.88 → 478.58] for them to watch.
[478.74 → 480.62] That's what is being communicated to me personally.
[480.94 → 482.14] That's what I'm taking from this.
[482.14 → 484.16] And yeah, yeah, yeah.
[484.26 → 490.90] Cat OS points out that ads on YouTube videos, ads on YouTube are videos on the platform, like
[490.90 → 492.36] in terms of how they work on the back end.
[492.46 → 492.58] Yeah.
[492.72 → 501.18] So you 100% can upload a video to YouTube that contains instructions for ad blocking as long
[501.18 → 504.68] as you do an ad buy against it.
[504.68 → 507.20] I wonder what other YouTube rules you can break.
[507.20 → 508.72] Like, how far can you take that?
[508.84 → 512.92] Because there are a lot of things that I could think in Google Ads that are against YouTube
[512.92 → 513.70] terms of service.
[516.02 → 521.34] Chewy, our community, our community coordinator, I don't know what the heck his job title is,
[521.40 → 522.12] but whatever, he's cool.
[522.76 → 527.38] He says in chat, if you stop paying for the video to be shown as an ad, will it then get
[527.38 → 527.90] struck down?
[529.02 → 530.00] I don't know.
[530.06 → 530.68] That's a good question.
[531.14 → 532.00] I don't know.
[532.10 → 535.26] I feel like no, but it's a good question.
[535.26 → 542.96] I just, look, I feel like this is one of those times when people are going to find some,
[543.00 → 544.20] try to find some gotcha.
[544.54 → 546.00] So let me clarify my stance.
[546.26 → 547.76] I don't use ad blockers.
[548.22 → 553.38] That is a personal choice that I've made because I am a content creator, and it would feel pretty
[553.38 → 559.54] hypocritical of me to use ad blockers when I am both aware of and educate people on the
[559.54 → 561.82] impact that it has on content creators.
[561.82 → 570.04] I do not and have never said, never use an ad blocker, you fucking monster, horrible people.
[570.12 → 570.86] I have never said that.
[570.90 → 571.68] That has never happened.
[571.82 → 575.56] If you think it happened, you imagined it or someone lied to you and told you that it
[575.56 → 575.82] happened.
[575.94 → 576.76] That is the only...
[576.76 → 577.78] You said it to me behind the scenes.
[577.88 → 583.52] That is the only way that those things could have been an experience that you had.
[583.52 → 589.38] And we have explicitly provided instructions on ad blocking before on our channel.
[589.48 → 590.64] We've done a video on Spyhole.
[590.76 → 592.24] We have the do you Google your life video?
[592.36 → 592.76] Multiple times.
[592.78 → 598.72] We've discussed our histories as pirates before we could afford to buy things extensively on
[598.72 → 599.34] the WAN show.
[600.00 → 606.34] So the big controversy is I said ad blocks piracy because it is, and some people got butt hurt.
[607.08 → 608.94] That's pretty much what it boils down to.
[608.94 → 611.06] But I never said don't do piracy.
[611.16 → 614.12] I never said put away your eye patch and your tricorn hat.
[614.24 → 616.36] I just said, well, it's a form of piracy.
[616.46 → 618.08] You're circumventing the payment on the platform.
[618.20 → 619.80] Therefore, piracy is kind of simple.
[619.94 → 621.08] It's actually really simple.
[624.08 → 632.22] So I'm not upset that Google is promoting ad blockers on a platform where I rely on ads.
[632.22 → 638.44] What I'm upset about is the hypocrisy that we are seeing from, and I get it.
[638.44 → 639.02] I get it.
[639.06 → 640.20] Companies have silos.
[640.64 → 642.20] You know, they'll have different policies.
[642.48 → 643.50] They'll have different teams.
[643.94 → 648.22] There's all these there's all these factors that I think people who have never worked for
[648.22 → 649.66] a larger company don't consider.
[649.88 → 652.94] It is not surprising to me that this happened.
[652.94 → 659.42] What is surprising to me, though, is now that it's been flagged, that it is not just, oh,
[659.98 → 663.96] duh, obvious that this should not be.
[664.20 → 671.40] Because if your policy is that because of user safety, potentially harmful or dangerous content,
[671.82 → 678.66] that my video showing people how to block ads on YouTube was removed, not just they contacted
[678.66 → 683.58] me, and we had a conversation, and we agreed to take it down.
[683.76 → 685.24] No, removed.
[686.04 → 688.02] And then they contacted me.
[688.46 → 690.24] Actually, I think I read about it on Reddit first.
[690.72 → 692.54] I don't I don't actually remember.
[692.62 → 694.34] The point is they just ripped the video down.
[694.76 → 696.38] So that's what happens there.
[696.66 → 699.74] But if you're running it as an ad, well, I don't know.
[699.76 → 700.52] It's a different team.
[700.66 → 701.30] I don't know.
[702.92 → 703.36] What?
[704.56 → 706.08] That doesn't make any sense.
[706.08 → 709.50] But hey, they had a good earnings call there.
[709.62 → 709.84] They're up.
[709.92 → 710.30] How many?
[710.34 → 710.90] How many points?
[711.06 → 711.58] I can't remember.
[714.16 → 715.52] We've got a couple other points here.
[715.58 → 723.96] It wasn't long ago, 2023, that Google sponsored a conference for ad block developers and at
[723.96 → 727.74] the least five Google employees gave presentations at the same time that YouTube was getting more
[727.74 → 728.84] aggressive in dealing with ad blocking.
[728.92 → 730.20] Yeah, that doesn't surprise me that much.
[731.10 → 734.38] Unique username says not to be that guy, Linus, but I don't think anyone ever used the word
[734.38 → 735.54] piracy for what you described.
[735.64 → 737.08] So at least some confusion is warranted.
[737.18 → 737.36] I am.
[738.40 → 738.88] I'm sorry.
[738.94 → 740.66] I just actually don't think it's that complicated.
[743.46 → 748.30] Yeah, it's circumvention of payment for the digital product.
[748.46 → 749.22] Personal gain.
[750.44 → 750.80] Right.
[750.88 → 751.94] Like that's that's what we call it.
[751.98 → 757.16] We don't call it theft because if is you don't remove it or whatever, you know, whatever
[757.16 → 758.28] the rationalization is.
[758.34 → 758.46] Right.
[758.50 → 761.68] Like if you don't actually remove it from the possession of the person who has it, then
[761.68 → 762.34] it can't be theft.
[762.46 → 762.78] I'm sure.
[762.78 → 764.14] OK, like it doesn't matter.
[764.26 → 765.56] It's all it's all semantics.
[765.94 → 766.20] Right.
[766.26 → 770.08] Like that's the whole point is that they someone has a thing.
[770.16 → 771.08] They set a price for it.
[771.12 → 772.62] You decided no, and you took it anyway.
[773.04 → 774.72] So you call it whatever you want.
[774.76 → 774.98] Right.
[775.98 → 778.60] But the point is that it is functionally the same thing.
[779.52 → 781.18] But is it really not the point today?
[781.18 → 783.24] Because I just don't care.
[784.16 → 785.20] I just don't care.
[785.72 → 787.76] You do whatever works for you.
[787.76 → 792.46] And if you have like a super guilty conscience or whatever, and it makes you like really mad
[792.46 → 794.98] when someone calls you out and is like, that's what you're doing.
[795.52 → 796.34] That's your thing.
[796.72 → 797.74] You go deal with that.
[797.80 → 799.00] You talk to your therapist about it.
[799.04 → 800.14] You talk to your mom about it.
[800.16 → 801.14] You talk to your friends about it.
[801.24 → 802.22] Or just don't care.
[802.40 → 803.26] Or just don't care.
[803.74 → 809.40] Or go on Team U while you still can and order a tricorn hat and an eye patch.
[809.86 → 810.94] That's also an option.
[811.34 → 813.28] Yeah, I think a lot of people are dusting them off right now.
[813.80 → 814.52] Like, dude.
[814.58 → 815.16] Big time.
[815.26 → 817.34] Dude, did Netflix just raise pricing again?
[817.72 → 818.54] I didn't.
[818.74 → 820.46] I feel like that is a statement.
[820.76 → 821.82] I could say that any time.
[821.96 → 823.86] A question and answer that is permanently true.
[824.00 → 824.14] Yeah.
[827.32 → 828.00] We should.
[828.36 → 828.76] Okay.
[829.58 → 830.38] I sent you this.
[830.40 → 831.54] You should have an LTT eye patch.
[832.74 → 833.66] That's a pretty good idea.
[833.70 → 834.92] That's actually a perfect idea.
[835.06 → 836.82] Dan, can you send it to the team?
[837.16 → 837.56] Yes.
[837.72 → 838.56] And tricorn hat.
[838.56 → 839.84] And then you get it.
[839.84 → 842.42] If it's a combo, then you get them at a lower price.
[842.54 → 844.72] And if you steal them from us, you get it for free.
[847.90 → 849.10] Which, I mean, is sort of.
[849.28 → 850.22] That's kind of how that works.
[850.22 → 851.28] It kind of goes without saying.
[852.34 → 857.60] A group that did a price increase in a way that I think was really cool recently.
[857.98 → 859.88] And I sent to you was Dropout.
[861.18 → 861.76] Remember that?
[862.94 → 863.30] Yes.
[864.70 → 865.88] Why is my thing not working?
[866.00 → 866.84] Oh, it's dropout.tv.
[866.96 → 867.78] I was doing dropout.com.
[867.78 → 869.58] Anyway, they had a video on it.
[869.68 → 872.32] And you can tell they did something right here.
[872.86 → 879.78] When the video on them increasing their pricing was like very well liked.
[879.94 → 881.72] And the comments are really positive.
[882.06 → 883.66] Yeah, it was like one minute long too.
[883.66 → 884.58] Trying to see if I can even find it.
[885.26 → 886.42] It was really short.
[888.32 → 889.24] Dropout.
[890.46 → 893.80] Basically, they were just like, yeah, we're increasing pricing, but it's only for new people.
[893.90 → 894.26] Here we go.
[894.40 → 895.42] Price change warning.
[895.42 → 896.18] Two minutes.
[896.48 → 899.20] But I watched it at 1.75, so it probably took me a minute.
[899.72 → 901.24] Yeah, it's so short.
[901.34 → 903.60] Vlog brothers responded with just charge me more, dork.
[903.72 → 904.68] And people liked it.
[905.44 → 908.76] This comment, you know when you have something special when an announcement that you're raising
[908.76 → 911.64] your prices has an overwhelmingly positive comment section.
[911.92 → 912.56] And it's legit.
[912.72 → 915.18] And it's because they did it in a cool way.
[915.54 → 917.28] Well, they didn't even do it in a cool way.
[917.34 → 918.78] They just did it the way it should be done.
[919.08 → 921.00] And everyone else sucks.
[921.00 → 926.86] Yeah, I think it goes up for new customers, and it goes up for returning customers.
[926.94 → 929.70] So if you cancelled and are coming back, it went up as well.
[929.84 → 930.84] I will do you one better.
[931.82 → 934.12] Our returning customers keep their existing pricing.
[934.50 → 936.26] But we might have to change that at some point.
[936.34 → 938.06] That probably doesn't make sense forever.
[938.70 → 940.80] What if someone's returning from 2017?
[941.32 → 941.58] Yeah.
[941.80 → 943.10] Are they really a returning customer?
[943.10 → 947.02] I think the way that YouTube defines a new viewer to the channel is 90 days.
[947.20 → 949.66] It's either 90 days or 30 days or something like that.
[949.68 → 950.44] I wouldn't mind having a buffer.
[950.64 → 951.30] That seems reasonable.
[951.42 → 952.82] I think a little buffer might be reasonable.
[953.16 → 956.10] But I think if someone's coming back after a year or whatever, they can just...
[956.66 → 960.10] Clearly, they're doing the thing where they buy for one month, download everything,
[960.68 → 961.86] then cancel and then watch it.
[961.86 → 962.48] And that's fine.
[962.54 → 963.26] But then they can pay...
[963.26 → 964.04] You can pay full price.
[964.08 → 965.34] They can pay a couple dollars more.
[965.44 → 965.64] Yeah.
[965.98 → 966.76] It's not going to kill them.
[966.90 → 970.64] I just wanted to point out because, again, we talk about how there's a lot of negative news.
[971.20 → 972.00] Okay, hold on, hold on.
[972.00 → 973.26] That was three weeks ago, but I thought it was cool.
[973.34 → 974.22] Okay, Deep Blue 7.
[974.44 → 977.72] I use ad blockers because I don't want to pay for the content.
[977.90 → 980.48] Oh, I don't use ad blockers because I don't want to pay for the content.
[980.58 → 982.50] I use them because I don't want companies to track me.
[982.72 → 984.42] And there's like a bunch more about why you use them.
[984.70 → 985.50] I'm not judging.
[986.06 → 987.58] Again, I can't make this clear enough.
[987.72 → 988.56] At no point in time.
[988.56 → 992.68] We have literally made videos on how to do what you're doing.
[992.78 → 993.60] We've helped you.
[993.82 → 994.52] And we've talked about the benefits.
[994.70 → 996.18] We will probably continue helping you.
[996.32 → 996.72] We will.
[997.34 → 997.82] We will.
[998.24 → 999.86] We're talking about it right now.
[1000.28 → 1001.28] We're talking about it right now.
[1001.28 → 1009.60] I am mad because my video on googling your life, which included how to run ad blockers on YouTube, was taken down.
[1009.70 → 1013.00] We're very annoyed that we weren't able to give you the info on how to block ads.
[1014.04 → 1016.96] Don't interpret this the wrong way.
[1017.54 → 1019.32] I choose not to use them.
[1020.78 → 1022.16] That's a personal choice.
[1022.16 → 1025.40] You choose to use them for whatever reason you like.
[1025.84 → 1027.40] And that is your personal choice.
[1027.42 → 1028.30] And that's a legit reason.
[1028.82 → 1029.58] And it's piracy.
[1030.26 → 1031.14] And I don't care.
[1031.62 → 1032.84] And you shouldn't care either.
[1033.16 → 1034.10] If you don't care.
[1034.66 → 1034.86] Yeah.
[1034.92 → 1035.42] That's it.
[1035.82 → 1035.96] Yeah.
[1036.04 → 1036.34] That's all.
[1036.38 → 1036.90] It's okay.
[1037.82 → 1038.50] It's okay.
[1039.22 → 1039.64] You know what?
[1039.68 → 1041.58] You don't need to talk to your therapist about it anymore.
[1042.28 → 1043.54] I will do that for you.
[1043.62 → 1044.86] I hear that.
[1045.18 → 1047.92] We're going to take whatever par asocial relationship we had.
[1048.08 → 1048.86] And just try it.
[1048.86 → 1050.10] And we're going to go like this.
[1050.60 → 1052.22] We're going to turn it up to 11.
[1056.22 → 1057.32] Oh, man.
[1057.72 → 1058.04] All right.
[1058.06 → 1063.42] Our discussion question on this topic is, why didn't you warn us about pie, Linus?
[1064.02 → 1064.42] Yeah.
[1065.18 → 1065.88] Why didn't I?
[1065.94 → 1066.42] Why didn't you?
[1066.54 → 1067.06] Why didn't I?
[1067.28 → 1068.58] Honestly, disappointed.
[1068.84 → 1070.94] I don't click on ads, so I didn't know what it was.
[1071.10 → 1073.28] I just could tell that it was an ad blocker.
[1073.80 → 1076.60] So I basically got mad at YouTube.
[1076.60 → 1079.36] I was super SUS, because this is the first time I've ever heard of this.
[1079.60 → 1080.94] And they say, get paid.
[1081.40 → 1083.92] And I was immediately like, oh, what's going on?
[1083.92 → 1088.18] So they say, browse, you got to read the whole line.
[1088.32 → 1094.08] Browse ad free with pie ad block and earn cash rewards for the ads you choose to see.
[1094.80 → 1097.50] I read some Reddit threads real quick and stuff.
[1097.78 → 1098.70] Isn't this just brave?
[1099.44 → 1102.44] I think it's kind of like distributed brave.
[1103.36 → 1104.20] I think.
[1104.96 → 1106.42] You can just put it on other browsers.
[1106.68 → 1107.90] I found this interesting.
[1109.68 → 1110.60] Featured by Google.
[1110.76 → 1111.64] Verified by Google.
[1111.64 → 1112.74] Can you?
[1113.00 → 1113.36] Okay.
[1113.52 → 1115.22] Go to the actual Chrome store, though.
[1115.28 → 1116.28] Is that real?
[1116.94 → 1118.12] That looks like an image.
[1118.28 → 1119.34] I don't think that's even.
[1119.48 → 1122.02] I don't think that even pulls from the API or anything.
[1122.94 → 1123.22] I did.
[1123.30 → 1124.08] Not Play Store.
[1124.22 → 1124.74] That looks fake.
[1125.12 → 1125.72] What am I doing?
[1125.84 → 1126.38] What are you doing?
[1126.54 → 1127.10] It's right here, though.
[1127.12 → 1127.76] It found it anyway.
[1127.86 → 1128.34] Good job, Google.
[1129.24 → 1130.98] It didn't say featured on here.
[1131.00 → 1131.24] Oh, okay.
[1131.52 → 1133.08] But it does have a lot of ratings.
[1133.08 → 1134.18] It does have that number of ratings, though.
[1134.50 → 1134.80] Yeah.
[1136.92 → 1137.82] They have a good record.
[1137.82 → 1139.20] I thought this was interesting.
[1139.20 → 1141.86] They flagged themselves as a non-trader.
[1143.06 → 1144.88] I don't know if that's legitimate.
[1146.10 → 1146.60] A trader?
[1146.84 → 1147.68] What's a trader?
[1147.94 → 1152.44] So I had to do a bunch of research on this a while back because we had to flag float plane
[1152.44 → 1154.22] as a trader.
[1155.20 → 1157.66] But I think that's because we receive payment.
[1158.18 → 1159.58] They don't receive payment.
[1159.82 → 1165.04] But if they are sending payment, I feel like they would still be a trader.
[1165.04 → 1170.06] And I feel like they're trying to get away from this because it notes on the end there.
[1170.06 → 1173.60] What if they're sending payment, but they're not sending any to Russia or China?
[1173.80 → 1174.58] Are they still a trader?
[1178.66 → 1179.68] Yeah, definitely.
[1180.10 → 1180.18] Yeah.
[1180.32 → 1181.94] T-R-A-D-E-R, to be clear.
[1182.64 → 1187.76] And it says, for consumers in the European Union, please note that consumer rights do not apply
[1187.76 → 1189.92] to contracts between you and this developer.
[1191.54 → 1192.72] Chat knows what I want.
[1192.82 → 1193.68] Where's my ding?
[1193.68 → 1196.44] Oh.
[1198.82 → 1200.26] I'm like conditioned now.
[1200.40 → 1201.26] I'm the dog.
[1201.48 → 1203.80] I need my ding.
[1204.40 → 1205.06] I'm sorry.
[1205.22 → 1206.32] I missed your joke.
[1207.60 → 1209.30] I didn't even think it was really like a joke.
[1209.68 → 1210.32] I wasn't listening.
[1210.38 → 1211.54] You were playing on the word trader.
[1211.68 → 1211.84] Yeah.
[1212.14 → 1213.18] But it was just like...
[1213.18 → 1214.30] That's classic ding.
[1214.84 → 1215.90] That's classic ding.
[1215.90 → 1216.44] Classic ding.
[1216.58 → 1217.22] Classic ding.
[1217.24 → 1217.96] You get a makeup ding.
[1218.10 → 1218.62] Dan knows.
[1218.82 → 1219.54] You get a makeup ding.
[1219.54 → 1220.12] Let's go.
[1220.30 → 1221.42] Oh, that feels good.
[1221.44 → 1222.08] I'm sorry, Linus.
[1222.08 → 1222.74] That feels good.
[1222.74 → 1224.06] I took that from you.
[1225.26 → 1225.70] Okay.
[1225.70 → 1226.74] What are we supposed to be talking about?
[1226.80 → 1227.66] What are you even talking about?
[1227.70 → 1228.22] Oh, traders.
[1228.40 → 1228.56] Right.
[1228.80 → 1229.70] Trader Joe.
[1230.20 → 1230.64] Sorry.
[1230.98 → 1233.22] Dan's saying, I'm sorry I took that from you.
[1233.64 → 1234.86] It was way too funny.
[1235.64 → 1236.58] Oh, God.
[1236.78 → 1237.68] I took that from you.
[1237.68 → 1238.62] I took it from you.
[1238.82 → 1239.88] I made it.
[1239.88 → 1240.72] Okay.
[1240.72 → 1240.78] Okay.
[1240.78 → 1241.14] Sorry.
[1242.60 → 1243.54] Oh, man.
[1244.72 → 1247.16] Extremely normal employee boss interactions.
[1247.46 → 1248.04] Oh, yeah.
[1251.40 → 1255.64] Jordan says, as soon as I started writing this topic, we couldn't get a Pi ad to come up.
[1255.70 → 1256.48] No matter what we tried.
[1256.54 → 1257.88] Is Google watching the WAN doc?
[1257.96 → 1258.38] Hi, Google.
[1258.66 → 1260.22] No, probably not, Jordan.
[1260.72 → 1262.58] Probably they just paused their campaigns.
[1262.58 → 1269.80] Apparently, I've watched a couple of videos that I'm not sure if I was supposed to watch
[1269.80 → 1276.24] about how bigger organizations who do a lot, like tens of millions of dollars a year of
[1276.24 → 1282.62] this kind of advertising work, and they are like cycling through creative.
[1282.94 → 1289.50] They're like cycling through campaigns at a rate that was already back then unfathomable to me,
[1289.58 → 1291.40] like the size of the teams that would need to work on this.
[1291.46 → 1295.82] And now that you can have AI agents that would do this kind of stuff, I'm sure that it's 10x,
[1295.92 → 1297.30] 100x what it was before.
[1297.52 → 1298.36] It's pretty wild.
[1298.80 → 1303.48] So probably they just had a campaign paused, and they were working on changeover or something.
[1303.48 → 1308.44] This is not a topic, but there's a lot of really, really nefarious advertising going
[1308.44 → 1316.56] on right now, which is undisclosed advertising with fake AI creators talking about life change
[1316.56 → 1317.12] stuff.
[1317.86 → 1318.68] Life change stuff?
[1318.70 → 1320.06] One that I saw recently.
[1320.06 → 1320.24] Like puberty?
[1320.60 → 1321.84] Are you going through the change?
[1322.34 → 1323.18] Do you have hair?
[1323.50 → 1323.72] Yeah.
[1324.02 → 1324.20] Yeah.
[1324.26 → 1324.90] It's very new.
[1324.96 → 1325.42] In places?
[1325.58 → 1326.52] I haven't had it before.
[1328.78 → 1329.54] It's a lot to get used to.
[1329.54 → 1330.44] Do you want to talk about it?
[1330.84 → 1331.66] That would help.
[1331.66 → 1333.04] You are the therapist now.
[1336.22 → 1337.22] Look at me.
[1341.32 → 1341.76] Okay.
[1341.86 → 1351.36] Anyway, the one that I saw was one account that was constantly, it was always women, but
[1351.36 → 1352.12] they're all different.
[1352.52 → 1355.00] And it was clearly not like a stories account.
[1355.08 → 1356.44] These were clearly just AI generated.
[1356.44 → 1362.34] And it would talk about how they moved to this new country to get away from whatever.
[1362.76 → 1366.10] And this current one was like, oh, I moved to the one that I saw, I think was I moved
[1366.10 → 1366.88] to Poland.
[1367.30 → 1369.88] I'm pretty sure to get away from the Trump administration.
[1370.18 → 1372.54] And I was happy with all these different things.
[1372.54 → 1376.70] And I learned that by law, you have to have a water filter.
[1377.02 → 1379.14] And my hair and skin has never felt better.
[1379.34 → 1382.68] And when I moved out of the place that I was in, I liked my water filter so much, I was
[1382.68 → 1383.18] going to take it.
[1383.24 → 1386.40] And then my landlord said, why don't you just look up this brand on Amazon?
[1386.40 → 1388.52] And I was like, wow, what a good tip.
[1391.28 → 1392.68] Undisclosed, obvious ad.
[1393.08 → 1397.12] And every single post from this one account, because no one seems to look into it or care.
[1397.12 → 1402.28] The comments, by the way, the reason why I'm saying it's so nefarious, the comments, by
[1402.28 → 1404.84] the way, are all just fighting over political things.
[1406.28 → 1411.12] Nobody's pointing out this is clearly an AI generated content slop wrapped around an ad.
[1411.12 → 1412.58] Did you click on any of the commenters?
[1412.64 → 1413.70] Do they seem to be human?
[1413.96 → 1415.32] I didn't click on the commenters.
[1415.86 → 1420.54] But they're all just fighting about, it's, oh, Poland is this way because of whatever,
[1420.72 → 1422.50] Trump, blah, blah, blah, something, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[1422.50 → 1423.72] It was all just political fighting.
[1423.82 → 1428.06] I was reading about how brain rot seems to actually not be a figure of speech.
[1428.18 → 1433.50] Like, you know, how when our parents were kids, they said that like reading fiction was
[1433.50 → 1434.32] going to rot your brain.
[1434.42 → 1439.42] And then when the Gen Hers were kids, it was watching TV is going to rot your brain.
[1439.50 → 1441.64] And then for us, it was video games are going to rot your brain.
[1442.36 → 1449.96] But like, no, really, like scrolling through shorts and stories and whatnot seems to actually
[1449.96 → 1450.68] rot your brain.
[1450.68 → 1456.50] Like they're measuring very, very different cognitive outcomes for younger kids.
[1456.54 → 1461.10] I think we talked about this recently, but the really remarkable thing, sort of having
[1461.10 → 1468.36] lived on the internet for my entire adult life has been watching the intelligence of humanity
[1468.36 → 1472.16] go like this and the intelligence of bots go like this.
[1472.26 → 1478.98] And I feel like we are dangerously close to the meeting point or maybe even past it where
[1478.98 → 1484.94] certain members of society, I think we're touching where the best bots or even a mediocre bot
[1484.94 → 1491.96] seems a lot more like a rational human being than a lot of people I encounter online.
[1492.18 → 1496.34] And part of the part of the problem, there needs to be two X speed on TikTok to double the
[1496.34 → 1496.74] brain rot.
[1496.74 → 1497.82] That hurts me.
[1497.82 → 1497.84] That hurts me.
[1498.38 → 1499.96] That hurts me so much.
[1500.00 → 1501.46] That causes me physical pain.
[1502.70 → 1507.92] Part of the problem is that they're all wrapped up in human disguises, I guess.
[1508.34 → 1514.46] And to have your deception detector running 100% of the time is not a thing most people do.
[1514.46 → 1522.74] They're saying, they're also saying that Gen Z is supposed to be the most gullible generation
[1522.74 → 1523.08] ever.
[1524.76 → 1525.06] Ooh.
[1525.94 → 1527.70] Yeah, this is on Politico.
[1528.26 → 1536.38] Basically just talking through how the sources of information that they go to are so full of
[1536.38 → 1543.24] disinformation that they just have no, some of them, obviously not all.
[1543.38 → 1545.50] You guys watch the WAN show, so you know what's up.
[1545.82 → 1549.28] But anyway, the point is.
[1549.42 → 1549.82] Free therapy.
[1551.72 → 1552.62] Let's go.
[1556.90 → 1559.44] But these platforms are so full of disinformation.
[1559.44 → 1565.42] And the test that they did was apparently, it was about 3,000 students, and they showed them
[1565.42 → 1571.54] footage of like rioters, or not rioters, sorry, ballot box stuffers.
[1571.72 → 1575.16] And we're talking about sort of election fraud and voter fraud.
[1575.72 → 1581.06] And of the 3,000, three of them correctly identified that the footage was not in fact from America,
[1581.06 → 1581.98] but it was from Russia.
[1584.30 → 1584.74] Oh.
[1585.14 → 1585.44] 0.1%.
[1586.26 → 1588.44] There must have been language in the footage.
[1589.44 → 1590.96] No, no, there wouldn't be.
[1591.92 → 1593.72] Because it's just like talking, talking over it.
[1595.24 → 1595.96] Oh, I don't know.
[1595.98 → 1598.26] If you show a ballot box, there's got to be like writing on it.
[1598.48 → 1599.36] Or a flag.
[1599.62 → 1600.10] Or something.
[1602.24 → 1602.68] Anyway.
[1602.98 → 1609.60] Anyway, three of them apparently thought to like reverse look up or Google it or just not
[1609.60 → 1611.08] take it for granted.
[1613.34 → 1614.30] I don't know, dude.
[1614.30 → 1616.14] It's kind of scary.
[1616.14 → 1622.48] And to be clear, I think that a lot of our audience, and as much as this is sort of for
[1622.48 → 1628.70] a really stupid reason, I think a lot of our audience is pretty well-trained to look for
[1628.70 → 1629.64] multiple sources.
[1630.00 → 1634.72] Because for us, choosing a component for our gaming rig is like really, really important.
[1634.72 → 1644.50] And as many problems as there are, tech coverage is still somewhat okay.
[1645.62 → 1652.82] Like, I don't think it's been polarized the same way that political coverage has.
[1652.90 → 1655.14] There are certain areas where I think there's a lot of that.
[1655.14 → 1660.38] I think on like the Apple versus Android side, things have devolved into the point where
[1660.38 → 1662.56] you can kind of not even really have a conversation.
[1662.94 → 1664.54] And it's not so much that with consoles anymore.
[1664.58 → 1665.26] It's just depression.
[1665.76 → 1666.04] Yeah.
[1666.16 → 1666.30] Yeah.
[1666.38 → 1666.80] There's...
[1666.80 → 1667.50] They used to fight.
[1667.60 → 1668.50] Now they're just sad.
[1668.80 → 1669.00] Yeah.
[1671.52 → 1672.08] Sorry.
[1672.42 → 1676.88] So I really am not necessarily talking about our audience here.
[1676.88 → 1677.88] I think that...
[1678.42 → 1679.26] Not I think that.
[1679.30 → 1683.68] I've seen a lot of evidence over the years that our audience is a cut above the average
[1683.68 → 1685.96] YouTube commenter.
[1686.04 → 1687.52] Because I read a lot of comments on our channel.
[1687.62 → 1689.14] I read a lot of comments on other channels.
[1689.36 → 1695.10] And I don't know how to say this any more tactfully than I'm about to say it.
[1695.24 → 1699.72] But the general population on YouTube is pretty stupid, right?
[1699.72 → 1701.88] Whereas there's...
[1701.88 → 1710.62] Other than a few outliers, it's usually pretty well-reasoned discourse on our videos by comparison.
[1711.00 → 1711.76] And I don't know.
[1711.84 → 1715.26] If you disagree, then by all means insult our audience.
[1715.28 → 1720.32] The only reaction that I had wasn't that our audience might be better.
[1721.14 → 1724.08] My reaction is that you're looking at YouTube as a whole.
[1724.18 → 1726.06] That might be a better reflection of society.
[1726.34 → 1726.70] Well, no.
[1726.74 → 1727.00] I know.
[1727.12 → 1728.46] That's exactly what I mean.
[1728.46 → 1728.92] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1728.92 → 1736.10] That's why I'm saying these issues with a lack of media literacy, not being able to
[1736.10 → 1740.70] tell the difference between someone with journalism credentials and someone who just claims that
[1740.70 → 1745.14] they're a journalist every once in a while, but doesn't demonstrate any of the obvious
[1745.14 → 1747.62] care and attention to journalistic standards, right?
[1747.68 → 1749.08] Like not being able to tell the difference.
[1749.20 → 1753.04] I think the folks that are over here can probably tell the difference better than the general
[1753.04 → 1753.62] population.
[1754.30 → 1754.70] Yeah.
[1754.70 → 1761.26] One thing that I've been wondering about, I've like actually been thinking of emailing,
[1761.46 → 1766.22] like trying to find a university that has a, I don't know, psychologist that might work
[1766.22 → 1768.50] on something like this and email them and see if they'll get back to me.
[1768.58 → 1772.96] But I genuinely wonder how much of it is the physical repetition.
[1772.96 → 1779.04] Because you know how like people that get addicted to smoking, some of them will need a replacement
[1779.04 → 1782.06] for the physical act of smoking, not just the nicotine.
[1782.26 → 1782.34] Yep.
[1782.34 → 1787.06] And something that I've been wondering about is all of these apps work the same.
[1787.06 → 1790.90] Like it's the infinite scroll concept that you've actually pushed back on in the past.
[1790.90 → 1794.32] But the infinite scroll concept of like, you know, Facebook works that way.
[1794.40 → 1795.26] Instagram works that way.
[1795.32 → 1796.22] Twitter works that way.
[1796.32 → 1797.34] Threads works that way.
[1797.72 → 1798.76] TikTok works that way.
[1798.98 → 1800.34] Everything works that way now.
[1800.34 → 1801.14] Infinite scroll.
[1801.22 → 1802.14] Dude, you're trying to get...
[1802.14 → 1802.84] So this thing on your phone...
[1802.84 → 1804.60] You're trying to get some product information, dude.
[1804.92 → 1805.22] Yeah.
[1805.30 → 1809.94] And every website is designed for you to have to scroll forever to find any information about
[1809.94 → 1810.24] the thing.
[1810.24 → 1816.06] I genuinely wonder how much of the addiction is just doing this forever.
[1816.40 → 1820.14] Because people that will do this for five hours, which is not that much of an exaggeration.
[1820.16 → 1825.50] I mean, there are like near idle games where you basically just like click a thing or tap
[1825.50 → 1827.02] a thing or...
[1827.02 → 1831.34] So your brain is barely functioning, and you're doing some form of physical input.
[1831.56 → 1834.56] And people will talk about how you come out of it like in a haze.
[1834.64 → 1837.02] You don't even remember what you were doing for the last amount of time or whatever.
[1837.02 → 1842.94] So like how much of that is the old TV concept of...
[1842.94 → 1843.78] Clicking through the channels.
[1844.32 → 1847.74] Like how much of this is literally just you're swiping your phone?
[1847.84 → 1850.66] Because it's weird to me how ubiquitous it is.
[1850.80 → 1852.78] There isn't any side-scrolling one.
[1854.42 → 1856.58] They're all the same thing.
[1856.82 → 1859.00] All the apps work the same way.
[1859.14 → 1863.06] And when you're like, oh, I should get off Instagram and you load up Twitter, then you
[1863.06 → 1864.44] go do the same thing again.
[1864.44 → 1867.62] You're not actually escaping because they all act the same way.
[1867.68 → 1869.38] So they keep self-referencing.
[1869.52 → 1869.58] Yeah.
[1869.60 → 1874.64] What is it about sliding our finger that is lower friction than tapping our finger?
[1874.74 → 1876.40] And I mean, figurative friction.
[1876.56 → 1879.38] By the way, I want to make this abundantly clear.
[1879.70 → 1880.38] Tinder is not the same.
[1880.44 → 1881.36] We're not saying...
[1881.36 → 1882.08] And Tinder is not as popular.
[1882.24 → 1884.54] We're not saying we're like better than other people.
[1885.04 → 1885.66] I doom scroll.
[1886.24 → 1887.00] Loop doom scrolls.
[1887.02 → 1887.60] There's doom-scrolling.
[1887.82 → 1888.44] We get...
[1888.44 → 1888.94] Doom scrolling happens.
[1888.94 → 1890.76] We get caught in it too.
[1891.28 → 1892.06] We're just...
[1892.06 → 1893.56] Take this for what it is.
[1893.86 → 1896.12] Two fish caught in the net.
[1896.40 → 1898.20] Talking to all the other fish in the net.
[1898.32 → 1900.04] Going, how the fuck did we get in this net?
[1900.08 → 1901.30] And what the fuck is up with this?
[1901.36 → 1902.10] I have to keep...
[1902.10 → 1906.12] I'm very proactive about trying to set up tools to help me avoid it when I can.
[1908.18 → 1909.50] I will actively...
[1909.50 → 1913.04] Like if I notice it starts to get bad with a certain app, I'll just remove it from my
[1913.04 → 1915.10] phone completely for at least a minimum period of time.
[1915.10 → 1919.52] I try to set up alarms, but sometimes this suck.
[1920.78 → 1921.14] Yeah.
[1921.60 → 1923.32] And you can...
[1923.32 → 1923.96] Oh, man.
[1924.54 → 1926.52] See, I was thinking about this the other night.
[1927.18 → 1928.42] What the market would be...
[1928.42 → 1932.96] Because it's the classic XKCD standards strip, right?
[1933.02 → 1935.10] Like why do so many standards exist?
[1935.14 → 1937.52] Because everything else is imperfect and there are so many different standards.
[1937.58 → 1940.74] We should just have one that's like the one standard to rule them all and then you just
[1940.74 → 1941.48] have another standard, right?
[1941.48 → 1945.36] Okay, so I was thinking like realistically the last thing the world needs is another
[1945.36 → 1945.90] Android skin.
[1946.58 → 1952.10] But that video on the Light Phone 3 that we did recently, which is like that super basic
[1952.10 → 1953.84] phone that just does calling and text.
[1953.92 → 1956.98] You can take pictures and send pictures and that is it.
[1958.56 → 1961.86] I got like 700,000, 800,000 views or something like that.
[1962.22 → 1964.10] So there's clearly interest in dumb phones.
[1964.22 → 1968.18] But what people were really frustrated by with that particular phone was that like it's kind
[1968.18 → 1968.64] of useless.
[1968.64 → 1970.70] Like you can't pay for parking.
[1970.98 → 1973.74] You can't use it as a digital wallet.
[1974.10 → 1976.76] You can't send Wi-Fi messages.
[1977.00 → 1979.56] So you can't send messages on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.
[1979.70 → 1980.98] Like it doesn't run apps.
[1982.06 → 1989.26] And I was thinking like if there was a justification for a new Android to exist.
[1990.52 → 1991.08] What's up?
[1991.76 → 1994.44] Oh, you got a Pi ad when you wanted to look at the...
[1994.44 → 1994.60] Yeah.
[1994.70 → 1994.90] Okay.
[1994.94 → 1995.38] There you go.
[1996.42 → 1997.18] How many of you does this have?
[1997.78 → 1998.34] I can't remember.
[1998.34 → 1998.88] The video?
[1999.02 → 1999.14] Yeah.
[1999.14 → 2000.18] 924,000.
[2000.18 → 2000.38] Yeah.
[2000.46 → 2001.00] Even more now.
[2001.08 → 2002.56] So people are clearly interested in this.
[2002.56 → 2002.78] People care.
[2003.02 → 2008.86] And I was thinking that would be a justification for a new skin of Android or for a new handset
[2008.86 → 2013.48] maker to make a like a detox phone.
[2013.48 → 2015.62] But that actually has basic functionality.
[2015.80 → 2020.22] So like one of the things that you're talking about setting alarms for like using apps.
[2020.26 → 2021.74] And you can do that on basically anything.
[2021.74 → 2025.56] You can say like, oh, I want to limit my screen time to one hour of this a day or whatever.
[2026.20 → 2029.96] But as far as I know, they all just let you click add more.
[2030.76 → 2030.98] Yes.
[2031.30 → 2032.70] Or dismiss or whatever.
[2032.86 → 2036.68] And another big problem that I have is this sameness between the apps.
[2036.94 → 2041.20] Because you can't do like, I'm going to limit my social apps to this amount of time.
[2041.80 → 2042.12] So okay.
[2042.20 → 2042.40] What?
[2042.50 → 2043.60] Do you do like five minutes?
[2043.82 → 2045.48] YouTube has scrollable shorts.
[2045.72 → 2046.84] Instagram has scrollable shorts.
[2046.96 → 2048.10] TikTok has scrollable shorts.
[2048.10 → 2051.24] And a lot of creators upload to all of them anyway.
[2051.62 → 2052.94] X has stuff.
[2053.66 → 2055.20] There are so many different things.
[2055.60 → 2057.00] There are so many different things.
[2057.22 → 2057.52] So much stuff.
[2057.84 → 2058.92] They've got so much stuff.
[2058.98 → 2060.64] They're going to need more than one X pretty soon.
[2062.54 → 2062.84] Three.
[2062.98 → 2063.24] Three.
[2063.80 → 2064.02] Yeah.
[2064.30 → 2064.68] There we go.
[2065.96 → 2067.68] So, you know, what about that?
[2067.78 → 2071.62] You know what about a phone where you have to have, you literally have to have an accountability
[2071.62 → 2073.00] buddy who...
[2073.00 → 2073.58] I would love it.
[2073.58 → 2074.62] Who keys in a pin.
[2074.84 → 2079.60] And when you said it, you actually cannot look at Twitter again that day.
[2079.62 → 2079.84] Amazing.
[2079.92 → 2080.54] You can't.
[2080.56 → 2080.72] Yeah.
[2080.84 → 2081.06] Period.
[2081.36 → 2081.52] Yeah.
[2082.18 → 2085.60] Because the only solution for me was literally to remove the apps from my phone.
[2085.92 → 2086.12] Yep.
[2086.72 → 2087.84] So I did that with Twitter.
[2088.16 → 2089.18] And Twitter's still off my phone.
[2089.22 → 2090.88] It's been off my phone for quite a while now.
[2092.18 → 2099.00] But the problem that I have is like, I'll have a stupid app because one person that I
[2099.00 → 2100.60] know that's the only way that they communicate.
[2100.60 → 2105.58] And then that app probably does other crap as well.
[2106.36 → 2110.16] And then I'll find myself just like accidentally diverted.
[2110.34 → 2111.16] And then, oh, whoa.
[2111.24 → 2112.10] How long just went by?
[2112.26 → 2113.18] And it's like, darn it.
[2115.24 → 2118.06] So sometimes you can avoid those things more easily.
[2118.18 → 2119.10] Sometimes you can't.
[2122.20 → 2123.16] It is what it is.
[2123.80 → 2124.98] But yeah, it sucks.
[2125.58 → 2127.18] I really want to figure out...
[2127.18 → 2129.82] And it would be cool to me if someone made a video on it.
[2130.16 → 2132.46] I don't know if it makes sense to be an L2T video or not.
[2132.54 → 2138.54] But like, what is the theory behind why this stuff is so addictive?
[2138.54 → 2143.92] I know like humans are generally addicted to information.
[2144.08 → 2147.78] And it's like absolute information overflow to be able to just scroll.
[2147.88 → 2148.88] And there's new stuff all the time.
[2148.94 → 2150.86] It's why scrolling on the TV was popular back in the day.
[2153.48 → 2158.32] But I think there's a physical element to it as well with the actual scrolling.
[2158.32 → 2163.92] I know there's a common perspective that comes up of like, oh, I'll just keep scrolling until I find one more good one.
[2164.86 → 2168.40] But then how do you define a good one so then you end up just scrolling forever?
[2168.74 → 2170.88] There's all these little concepts to it.
[2172.22 → 2175.48] But it would be interesting to know.
[2175.96 → 2178.32] Because I haven't personally seen...
[2179.88 → 2181.98] Addiction is to stimuli, not information, I think.
[2181.98 → 2191.46] I feel like we're going to get in trouble because we're talking about non-tech stuff that we don't know anything about.
[2191.56 → 2197.08] And then people are going to be like, you should have known every single possible fact about this again every time, by the way.
[2199.08 → 2200.42] But I thought it was both.
[2201.40 → 2202.10] But I don't know.
[2205.18 → 2205.54] Cool.
[2207.04 → 2210.02] Why don't we talk about whatever it is we're supposed to be doing right now?
[2210.54 → 2211.40] Let's do some announcements.
[2211.98 → 2213.10] Oh, let's do announcements!
[2214.58 → 2224.56] So I would like to give a massive shout-out to our team at MBC, who's been handling the shipment side of the ship storm.
[2225.52 → 2237.90] They have managed to keep pace with the unbelievable demand that the free shipping on orders over $150, lttstore.com, promotion has generated.
[2239.00 → 2240.12] Shout-out those guys.
[2240.12 → 2245.98] That is why the ship storm sale event has been able to be extended.
[2245.98 → 2260.52] Because our concern, as I explained when we first launched it, was that if we didn't end it after a little over a week, I think was the original time frame, they would be so backlogged that we wouldn't be able to get things over the border before that May 2nd deadline.
[2260.52 → 2264.70] When tariffs, I mean, at this point, may, may not.
[2264.90 → 2265.80] They could be this amount.
[2265.88 → 2266.54] They could be this amount.
[2266.84 → 2267.42] Who knows?
[2267.48 → 2269.68] But that was the date that we were working off of.
[2269.96 → 2274.28] And the numbers we were working off of indicated that pricing would have to go up quite significantly.
[2274.28 → 2278.72] Anyway, we were worried that that would be the last day we'd be able to ship stuff out.
[2278.72 → 2291.10] But they have kept up so incredibly that not only are we extending the ship storm sale event, but we actually have some new things to add to it.
[2291.56 → 2295.78] The power outlet is apparently what we're calling our B-stock.
[2295.78 → 2304.00] So at the power outlet, you can get a great deal on open box and pre-owned goods.
[2304.14 → 2304.76] That's a pretty good name.
[2304.92 → 2307.38] We reduce waste, everyone wins.
[2307.68 → 2310.10] So we have open box backpacks.
[2310.30 → 2315.04] You can get a brand new one, but it's missing the box for $179 USD.
[2315.50 → 2316.76] No cosmetic wear.
[2316.76 → 2325.18] You can get a used like new with minor cosmetic wear and used A-grade with moderate cosmetic wear.
[2325.18 → 2327.94] And we've got, oh, that one's sold out, apparently.
[2328.12 → 2328.50] Oh, okay.
[2328.56 → 2329.62] All we have left is new boxes.
[2329.80 → 2332.18] Well, the point is we...
[2333.20 → 2334.08] Classic LTG store.
[2334.34 → 2335.42] Introduced that deal.
[2335.78 → 2336.24] Oh boy.
[2336.54 → 2336.92] Well, hold on.
[2337.02 → 2338.08] There's got to be more, right?
[2338.44 → 2344.00] There's a used backpack between both of you to show off.
[2344.48 → 2345.04] Nice.
[2345.04 → 2351.76] We should probably get this to the shipment team so that they can put it up for sale because apparently the rest of them are sold out.
[2353.02 → 2353.46] Cool.
[2353.46 → 2359.48] So the least expensive tier apparently sold out really fast, followed by the like new tier the following day.
[2359.58 → 2360.30] You all blew us away.
[2360.70 → 2367.00] We still have some new open box ones available so you can save about $70 on a brand-new OG LTT backpack.
[2367.16 → 2367.74] Here's a question.
[2367.74 → 2376.74] Just note that these are OG backpacks with either the old style carabiner zipper or without carabiners and just regular PKK zips.
[2377.66 → 2378.00] Okay.
[2378.24 → 2378.42] Sorry.
[2378.48 → 2379.24] What is that, sir?
[2379.24 → 2383.52] It says boxless, but I'm assuming it's still going to come in a box.
[2385.56 → 2386.94] I wouldn't assume anything.
[2387.28 → 2387.64] Okay.
[2387.86 → 2388.86] It might come in an envelope.
[2389.26 → 2389.52] Oh.
[2389.62 → 2390.18] Huge one.
[2390.30 → 2390.54] Wow.
[2391.08 → 2392.12] I don't know.
[2392.26 → 2392.98] I'd be impressed.
[2393.10 → 2394.34] I'm sure it'll get there in one piece.
[2394.42 → 2395.66] And if it doesn't, contact support.
[2395.74 → 2395.90] Good job, team.
[2395.90 → 2400.66] Uh, we also brought back mystery screwdrivers, but with a twist.
[2401.22 → 2404.36] Basically, we're moving these screwdrivers so fast we don't have time to pack them.
[2404.48 → 2406.06] And also we're in a hurry because tariffs.
[2406.50 → 2409.66] Um, because we got to get them out before May 2nd.
[2409.66 → 2416.94] So we're giving you $20 off if you buy a screwdriver and included standard or knock to a bit set without the usual screwdriver box.
[2417.28 → 2419.06] So that's what makes it mystery.
[2419.50 → 2420.52] It doesn't have a box.
[2421.04 → 2423.56] All mystery screwdrivers will ship without a box.
[2424.00 → 2424.86] Look at that.
[2425.26 → 2426.80] We don't have time to pack these screwdrivers.
[2426.92 → 2427.56] Blah, blah, blah.
[2427.72 → 2429.22] All sales final will ship without a box.
[2429.70 → 2435.68] Uh, possible colourways are knock to a beige or knock to a brown, but it is the same quality screwdriver.
[2436.72 → 2437.08] Okay.
[2437.12 → 2437.68] What else we got?
[2437.74 → 2440.00] Is that, is that it for, is that it for this?
[2440.14 → 2440.90] Big nerd gaming.
[2441.08 → 2442.38] Oh no, we have it?
[2442.40 → 2443.24] Big nerd gaming alert.
[2443.24 → 2444.48] Oh, we have big nerd gaming.
[2444.96 → 2445.36] Okay.
[2445.66 → 2447.18] Are you like big nerd gaming?
[2447.38 → 2454.34] If you watched Secret Shopper part one, um, we're pretty sure the guy on the phone said beginner gaming.
[2455.54 → 2458.30] Um, but that's not as much fun as what we thought he said.
[2458.38 → 2459.68] Big nerd gaming is hilarious.
[2459.68 → 2460.16] Which is big nerd gaming.
[2460.60 → 2463.00] Um, so we can click here and we can see the design.
[2463.94 → 2465.16] I'm going to be big nerd gaming.
[2465.32 → 2465.52] Dude.
[2466.24 → 2467.64] Why is Sarah such a Chad?
[2468.64 → 2470.04] Because this looks awesome.
[2470.24 → 2470.86] It looks great.
[2470.86 → 2472.02] This looks so good.
[2472.54 → 2473.58] We are ready to go.
[2473.58 → 2478.10] Uh, well, we're ready to go as soon as we, uh, ship these out by June the 27th.
[2478.10 → 2478.42] Yeah.
[2478.78 → 2479.00] Yeah.
[2479.54 → 2481.84] All orders containing this are expected to ship later.
[2481.90 → 2486.02] This is a print to order shirt, but I'm super, super exciting.
[2486.40 → 2487.60] Uh, I'm super excited.
[2487.76 → 2489.16] And finally, oh my God.
[2489.46 → 2490.36] Oh my God.
[2491.06 → 2492.42] Cargo pants are back in stock.
[2492.92 → 2495.44] Oh, cargo pants are back in stock.
[2495.80 → 2496.20] Dang.
[2496.88 → 2497.74] Uh, yeah.
[2498.32 → 2499.04] So that's cool.
[2499.50 → 2499.94] Dang.
[2499.94 → 2500.54] Dang.
[2500.54 → 2502.76] So we have different waist sizes.
[2502.88 → 2504.00] We don't have another unseam yet.
[2504.18 → 2506.22] So yeah, just the one, I guess.
[2507.40 → 2507.80] Yes.
[2508.44 → 2512.18] Uh, I think at some point we do want to add another one, but still out of luck for me.
[2512.24 → 2513.30] Just waist sizes for now.
[2513.40 → 2514.30] We'll get there.
[2514.80 → 2515.20] Okay.
[2515.20 → 2516.44] I got more shirts.
[2516.54 → 2518.48] I'm wearing one of my new tall shirts now.
[2518.78 → 2520.20] I will get pants eventually.
[2520.44 → 2526.80] With so many new deals and items, we've extended free shipping to all orders over $150 until
[2526.80 → 2528.76] Monday, 10 a.m. Pacific time.
[2528.86 → 2533.00] This is likely going to be the last time we can extend this promotion since we need to
[2533.00 → 2536.62] make sure that your orders get shipped out and get over the border on time.
[2536.98 → 2539.78] Make sure to take advantage of these deals and the free shipping before it's too late,
[2540.20 → 2542.14] especially if you're in the U.S.
[2542.42 → 2544.34] You can find it all at lttstore.com.
[2544.40 → 2545.64] Great, great work from the team.
[2545.90 → 2552.14] They, uh, really pulled it together, getting some of these items, um, some of these restocks
[2552.14 → 2553.12] up on the site.
[2553.48 → 2555.36] The Big Nerd Gaming was a Victor design.
[2555.80 → 2556.34] Was it?
[2556.38 → 2557.30] Oh, he did a great job.
[2557.38 → 2558.10] Fantastic work.
[2558.26 → 2560.90] Oh, I, I gave credit to the wrong person.
[2560.96 → 2561.54] It was so good.
[2561.58 → 2562.60] I thought Sarah did it.
[2563.20 → 2563.48] Wow.
[2563.48 → 2565.54] Well, that is a high compliment indeed, Victor.
[2565.66 → 2566.20] That's good stuff.
[2566.20 → 2567.20] You might call yourself...
[2567.86 → 2568.48] Victorious.
[2571.22 → 2572.34] That's my ding.
[2574.16 → 2575.44] You stole that from me.
[2575.44 → 2576.04] That's my ding.
[2576.10 → 2577.12] You stole that from me.
[2578.96 → 2579.52] All right.
[2581.78 → 2583.18] What are we supposed to be doing now?
[2583.24 → 2583.66] I don't know.
[2583.66 → 2584.64] How about a merch message?
[2584.92 → 2585.16] Sure.
[2586.18 → 2587.20] It's so sad.
[2587.20 → 2587.86] He's so sad.
[2588.32 → 2588.80] Hi, DLL.
[2588.98 → 2589.72] I finally upgrade.
[2589.92 → 2591.28] We should explain what merch messages are.
[2591.30 → 2591.70] Oh, yeah.
[2591.80 → 2592.56] I don't know what it's going on.
[2592.56 → 2593.40] I pirated your ding.
[2593.40 → 2597.38] No, if you pirated it, I would still have it.
[2597.38 → 2598.50] I privateered your ding.
[2598.58 → 2599.70] No, because I would still have it.
[2599.72 → 2600.38] You stole it.
[2600.54 → 2600.74] No.
[2601.36 → 2602.74] You wouldn't download a ding.
[2605.50 → 2606.34] Merch messages.
[2607.82 → 2608.10] Whatever.
[2608.24 → 2610.44] Just go on the store and in the cart, you can leave a merch message.
[2610.54 → 2613.92] Producer Dan will get it, and he will forward it to me and Luke, or he will just not.
[2613.92 → 2616.12] But it's quite possible that he just won't.
[2616.80 → 2617.60] Yeah, you get nothing.
[2617.74 → 2619.10] But you'll get your order in the mail anyway.
[2619.24 → 2619.58] All right.
[2619.84 → 2620.10] All right.
[2620.12 → 2620.38] Hit me.
[2620.68 → 2620.90] Sure.
[2621.62 → 2622.38] Hi, DLL.
[2622.66 → 2628.42] I have finally upgraded my graphics card from a GTX 970 to a 9070 XT.
[2628.76 → 2629.06] Question.
[2629.50 → 2632.36] Do you have any tips on an open world game for single player?
[2632.36 → 2634.58] Best regards from the middle of Sweden.
[2634.76 → 2636.24] It's one Celsius outside.
[2638.06 → 2641.54] One C to an open world single player game.
[2641.54 → 2644.34] I mean, okay, sure, I'll bite.
[2644.68 → 2645.42] Play Freelancer.
[2646.54 → 2653.88] It's not going to push your hardware, but it is a great underrated game.
[2653.90 → 2654.36] That's cool.
[2654.58 → 2654.90] I like it.
[2655.28 → 2661.56] That completely runs out of gas in the last 10% or so because they clearly ran out of budget.
[2661.92 → 2664.74] But boy, is it a hell of a ride up until that point.
[2665.56 → 2666.02] That's sick.
[2666.20 → 2667.22] Super great answer.
[2668.00 → 2670.38] Now we've got some floor plane announcements and a couple others.
[2670.38 → 2673.20] And he's going to say, how about Oblivion Remastered?
[2673.30 → 2673.80] There you go.
[2674.94 → 2675.92] Was that what you were going to say?
[2676.80 → 2677.20] Borrowing.
[2677.84 → 2678.32] Borrowing.
[2679.14 → 2681.38] Why not Borrowing Remastered?
[2682.62 → 2683.56] I don't know.
[2683.66 → 2687.16] If you haven't played it before, it's still good.
[2689.68 → 2691.46] Yeah, you could do that.
[2691.60 → 2697.22] I think modern with the updates and stuff, Cyberpunk is pretty sick.
[2698.52 → 2699.38] Try that out.
[2699.38 → 2705.76] More announcements.
[2706.56 → 2706.86] Oh.
[2707.24 → 2707.96] Oh, just one?
[2708.76 → 2708.98] What?
[2709.04 → 2710.24] No, we can't do more announcements.
[2710.42 → 2711.48] That's too many announcements.
[2711.74 → 2712.00] They can't.
[2712.40 → 2713.68] Announcements are like half the dock.
[2713.74 → 2715.44] We're just going to have to come back to announcements later.
[2715.48 → 2717.34] I think we're supposed to do the Float plane one now.
[2717.34 → 2718.10] We've got to do the Float plane one.
[2718.14 → 2719.28] We can come back to the rest of them later.
[2719.52 → 2719.88] Fine.
[2719.88 → 2732.22] If you're a big nerd gamer or a beginner gamer, get yourself an early screening of Secret Shopper Part 2 on Float plane, which I am about to make live right now.
[2732.22 → 2733.88] Why would we do this?
[2733.88 → 2735.38] I'm about to make live right now.
[2735.38 → 2737.08] Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[2737.08 → 2738.60] It says don't share your screen.
[2739.08 → 2739.56] It does?
[2740.44 → 2740.80] Linus?
[2740.90 → 2741.16] Sorry.
[2741.38 → 2742.72] Please share your screen.
[2743.04 → 2743.34] What?
[2743.34 → 2747.26] It says to share my screen and set the video to public.
[2747.54 → 2748.96] Don't read this out loud.
[2749.40 → 2750.76] I bet you read that out loud.
[2751.02 → 2752.12] Stop reading these out loud.
[2752.20 → 2754.66] Look, Luke, you literally can't follow instructions.
[2755.20 → 2755.58] All right.
[2755.70 → 2756.68] Yeah, let's just do it.
[2756.76 → 2757.26] Yeah, why not?
[2757.68 → 2758.08] Okay.
[2758.44 → 2763.02] This was supposed to come out Sunday per our 48-hour early release advertisement.
[2763.22 → 2769.92] However, Bjorn, the editor, and Pouffe, who owns a monitor, pushed through and delivered it for you guys now.
[2770.14 → 2770.42] Nice.
[2770.42 → 2774.68] So be ahead of the YouTube viewers as they have to wait over 90 hours to watch episode two.
[2775.38 → 2777.40] Why does he want you to share your screen when you do it?
[2777.58 → 2779.68] Why do you want to share your screen when you do things?
[2780.54 → 2782.24] But I, but I, I.
[2782.82 → 2784.20] Are you concerned about this?
[2784.28 → 2784.60] Yeah.
[2785.12 → 2785.52] Up here?
[2787.24 → 2788.32] Like, why does that matter?
[2788.84 → 2790.16] We've just never shared this.
[2790.22 → 2791.04] It's probably fine.
[2791.42 → 2793.38] I've just never thought about it or looked at it.
[2793.78 → 2794.18] Here's the.
[2794.18 → 2796.34] See, Dan, that's what, that's what.
[2796.54 → 2797.96] Here's the float plane CMS.
[2797.96 → 2800.66] I tried to cover it with something, and I was too slow.
[2800.68 → 2802.76] Just don't click anything else.
[2802.76 → 2803.54] Do things here?
[2803.92 → 2804.82] You don't want me to click here?
[2805.60 → 2806.50] How dare you?
[2806.80 → 2807.78] Do you want me to click here?
[2807.78 → 2808.94] No, just, yeah, just don't.
[2808.98 → 2809.38] How about here?
[2809.68 → 2809.98] No.
[2810.28 → 2811.24] How about legal agreement?
[2811.42 → 2811.62] No.
[2811.62 → 2812.28] You want me to click there?
[2812.70 → 2812.98] No.
[2812.98 → 2813.90] Should I click, uh.
[2817.30 → 2819.16] Joe says don't look.
[2819.66 → 2819.90] Yeah.
[2820.02 → 2820.64] Full plane support.
[2820.64 → 2821.28] There are things you like.
[2821.30 → 2822.22] Everyone close your eyes.
[2822.22 → 2825.62] There are things that would be a major legal problem if you clicked on them.
[2825.78 → 2827.00] I'm not going to click those things.
[2827.00 → 2827.50] I'm just saying.
[2827.98 → 2828.70] I know how the CMS.
[2828.84 → 2830.10] Dan, give me my CMS back.
[2830.74 → 2831.40] Uh, okay.
[2831.54 → 2831.82] Public.
[2832.28 → 2832.56] Book.
[2832.84 → 2834.52] Oh, why take the risk?
[2834.72 → 2835.54] I don't know.
[2835.98 → 2837.32] Life is about risk.
[2837.84 → 2840.06] Take risks or be boring forever.
[2840.46 → 2841.04] That's true.
[2841.14 → 2841.40] Boom.
[2841.56 → 2841.92] Save.
[2842.10 → 2844.26] I don't think this was a not boring thing, though.
[2845.90 → 2846.54] Change is saved.
[2846.60 → 2846.86] Oh, yeah.
[2846.86 → 2847.16] Okay.
[2847.34 → 2848.34] Well, uh, sure.
[2848.34 → 2850.26] You don't upload things to the float plane.
[2850.34 → 2851.54] Dude, I haven't done it forever.
[2853.02 → 2853.78] You know what?
[2854.56 → 2855.96] Haven't done it in forever.
[2857.76 → 2858.20] Yeah.
[2858.64 → 2862.52] We added the changes saved thing just because people didn't trust us.
[2862.94 → 2863.62] Well, yeah.
[2863.82 → 2864.44] It was you.
[2864.86 → 2865.24] Yeah.
[2865.76 → 2866.16] Good.
[2866.38 → 2866.92] You should.
[2867.46 → 2867.92] I want a.
[2867.92 → 2868.82] It was fair feedback.
[2868.92 → 2869.30] It was fair feedback.
[2869.30 → 2871.86] I want a confirmation that my changes are saved.
[2872.40 → 2873.38] Nothing else is good enough.
[2873.38 → 2877.74] I mean, if you grayed out the save, then we wouldn't have this problem because I would
[2877.74 → 2879.38] click save, and it would stay grayed out.
[2879.38 → 2882.78] Yeah, but the fade and then come back is indicating that it did a thing.
[2882.78 → 2884.02] No, but I haven't changed anything.
[2884.16 → 2884.74] No, that's old.
[2884.78 → 2885.54] That's old meta.
[2885.62 → 2886.48] If that was ever the meta.
[2886.62 → 2889.92] And the current meta is that I wouldn't be able to save if I haven't made a change.
[2890.18 → 2890.42] Yeah.
[2890.80 → 2892.94] Things on the CMS don't keep up with current meta.
[2893.00 → 2893.60] No, they really.
[2893.82 → 2894.60] No, they really don't.
[2894.80 → 2896.22] Things on the CMS keep up with.
[2896.28 → 2896.88] Does it work?
[2898.22 → 2898.54] Yeah.
[2898.80 → 2900.08] People are saying it's not live yet.
[2900.20 → 2901.26] It just went live.
[2901.36 → 2902.26] Chewie says, give it a minute.
[2902.54 → 2902.72] Yeah.
[2902.84 → 2903.50] It just went live.
[2903.50 → 2904.40] He says, give it a minute.
[2904.40 → 2905.90] It's a global thing.
[2906.06 → 2907.66] This is one of the reasons why we don't want to show.
[2908.34 → 2910.02] The same thing happens on YouTube.
[2910.76 → 2911.12] Yeah.
[2911.84 → 2912.56] It's normal.
[2912.70 → 2912.82] Yeah.
[2912.84 → 2915.36] Why do you think 25 people type first?
[2916.22 → 2921.64] Surely, if that other comment was there, they would be smart enough to not type first.
[2921.92 → 2922.24] Yeah.
[2922.38 → 2923.54] But it doesn't show up for them.
[2924.12 → 2924.78] Or they're dumb.
[2924.92 → 2926.48] Also, not everyone gets at the same time.
[2926.56 → 2927.04] It has to.
[2927.14 → 2927.88] No, that's what I'm saying.
[2928.00 → 2929.56] That's the point.
[2930.18 → 2931.60] No, you said it doesn't show up for them.
[2931.80 → 2932.00] Yeah.
[2932.00 → 2933.30] Oh, I thought you meant the other comments.
[2933.30 → 2933.56] Yeah.
[2933.78 → 2935.58] Because the other comments also might just not show up.
[2935.58 → 2935.72] Yeah.
[2935.96 → 2938.06] Because the comments and the video are on different.
[2938.46 → 2939.50] He's all caught up.
[2943.72 → 2944.96] Anyway, the first one was hilarious.
[2944.98 → 2947.12] Oh my God, we need a doesn't know and we need a narcissist shirt.
[2948.56 → 2949.36] Like separately?
[2949.64 → 2949.88] Yeah.
[2950.10 → 2950.58] Or run back?
[2950.58 → 2951.84] Like we do dual drops.
[2952.20 → 2952.48] Oh.
[2953.42 → 2954.52] We let people vote.
[2954.62 → 2958.28] We let them buy the narcissist shirt or the doesn't know shirt.
[2958.56 → 2961.32] I wonder how many people would just walk around with a narcissist shirt.
[2961.32 → 2963.36] I feel like, I feel like if.
[2963.44 → 2964.14] I'd have one of those.
[2966.18 → 2970.38] I feel like if, like, what's a brand that would do this?
[2970.56 → 2972.32] What's some like really expensive.
[2973.46 → 2976.60] Louis Vuitton would just have a purse that just says narcissist.
[2977.02 → 2978.04] That's my point.
[2978.18 → 2980.28] I feel like they would be an artist collab.
[2980.60 → 2981.36] I feel like they might.
[2981.94 → 2982.48] There is.
[2982.50 → 2984.60] But I feel like it would be more like a streetwear brand.
[2984.78 → 2985.08] No way.
[2985.18 → 2989.24] Like a streetwear X something collab where it just said narcissist on it.
[2989.24 → 2991.88] People are giving suggestions in float plane chat.
[2991.96 → 2995.38] I don't know if any of these are valid, but they're saying Supreme, Balenciaga.
[2996.00 → 2997.42] Balenciaga, I feel like would do it.
[2997.54 → 2998.54] Off-White, Marc Jacobs.
[2998.94 → 3002.20] It'd be a micro print, and would cost like a thousand dollars a foot.
[3004.76 → 3005.12] No.
[3006.22 → 3007.82] It would just be made in China.
[3007.92 → 3009.78] Then they would just tell everyone that it costs a thousand dollars.
[3009.94 → 3011.42] Already says Vehemence would do it.
[3011.56 → 3011.84] I don't know.
[3011.88 → 3012.40] I don't know any of these brands.
[3012.40 → 3013.64] I don't even know who that is.
[3015.26 → 3016.94] Because I don't know.
[3017.08 → 3019.58] Nick owes you an email about the shirts.
[3019.92 → 3020.36] Oh, does he?
[3020.54 → 3020.78] Yes.
[3020.90 → 3021.14] Okay.
[3021.86 → 3023.20] There's no way Kanye would do it.
[3023.26 → 3024.92] That would involve admitting that he's a narcissist.
[3025.12 → 3026.26] I don't think any actual narcissist would.
[3026.26 → 3029.70] I feel like Kanye would just sell a shirt that said Kanye on it, and it's effectively the same thing.
[3032.70 → 3033.60] Very good, sir.
[3033.68 → 3034.22] Very good.
[3034.80 → 3035.86] Big narcissist game.
[3035.86 → 3038.00] A car with a particular symbol, but we won't.
[3038.12 → 3038.42] We won't.
[3040.26 → 3040.92] We can.
[3042.56 → 3043.64] We got merch messages.
[3043.88 → 3045.34] What kind of car would he drive, Luke?
[3045.48 → 3046.44] Why don't you tell me?
[3046.54 → 3047.80] No, no, don't tell me.
[3048.12 → 3048.48] Okay.
[3048.58 → 3048.82] Does he know?
[3048.94 → 3049.24] No.
[3049.42 → 3049.90] I could.
[3053.14 → 3054.46] Anyway, merch messages.
[3054.60 → 3055.62] I think we need merch messages.
[3055.62 → 3057.06] Yeah, hit me with a merch message.
[3057.06 → 3057.30] Two more, I think.
[3057.32 → 3057.76] Jesus.
[3058.22 → 3058.64] One more?
[3058.72 → 3059.10] I don't know.
[3059.28 → 3059.72] One more.
[3060.06 → 3060.48] One more.
[3060.96 → 3062.14] Hello, LDL.
[3062.48 → 3062.64] Yeah.
[3062.76 → 3065.20] Linus, how happy were you with your Qualcomm laptop?
[3065.20 → 3068.20] Need a new laptop for travelling and light photo and video processing?
[3068.68 → 3071.12] Block ads, buy merch at lttstore.com.
[3071.88 → 3074.94] Um, it was okay.
[3075.14 → 3077.26] I'm actually not on it right now.
[3077.92 → 3083.64] Um, man, it is a dude, did you check out the framework short circuit by any chance?
[3084.58 → 3084.84] No.
[3085.00 → 3090.12] So investment in framework disclosure, the Dell that we used as our battery life comparison
[3090.12 → 3091.88] was insane.
[3091.88 → 3096.30] No, but like insane.
[3096.74 → 3098.20] Are you, are you checking it out right now?
[3098.32 → 3098.50] I am.
[3098.52 → 3098.66] Okay.
[3098.66 → 3099.94] See if you can find the battery life.
[3100.14 → 3101.80] See if you can find the battery life comparison.
[3102.74 → 3104.24] Uh, blah, blah, blah.
[3104.90 → 3105.10] Unboxing.
[3106.00 → 3106.18] Yeah.
[3106.50 → 3108.16] Dude, dude, dude, dude.
[3108.20 → 3112.48] This is, this actually blew my mind.
[3112.48 → 3113.48] Okay.
[3115.48 → 3120.56] Our battery life test for whatever reason is a little unforgiving, right?
[3120.60 → 3126.38] Like we, we always literally always test lower than what the manufacturer advertises, which
[3126.38 → 3126.96] fine.
[3126.96 → 3127.58] Which is fine.
[3127.58 → 3128.20] It's consistent.
[3128.34 → 3128.48] Yeah.
[3128.48 → 3133.26] It raises serious questions for me about what exactly it is that manufacturers are testing
[3133.26 → 3136.10] because like, there's only so many things that you can disable.
[3136.22 → 3137.48] We're already in battery saver mode.
[3137.56 → 3139.14] We're already at 200 nit brightness.
[3139.30 → 3140.10] Like what are you guys even doing?
[3140.22 → 3142.56] We're doing 10 AP playback the entire time.
[3142.68 → 3144.80] Disable your Bluetooth, disable your Wi-Fi.
[3145.04 → 3145.70] Like, come on, come on.
[3145.72 → 3146.58] What are you even talking about here?
[3146.64 → 3149.46] They're probably trying to simulate a balanced workload.
[3149.58 → 3151.02] Anyway, the point is we got it in the chamber.
[3151.34 → 3154.10] We're doing battery saver mode, 10 AP playback over Plex.
[3155.68 → 3156.60] 16 hours?
[3156.60 → 3158.84] 16 hours?
[3159.16 → 3160.02] That's incredible.
[3160.18 → 3160.64] It's wild.
[3160.74 → 3161.64] Why would I need a Qualcomm?
[3165.52 → 3166.66] That's a pretty good point.
[3166.86 → 3168.22] Raises serious questions for me.
[3168.40 → 3170.08] It's not that I didn't like the Qualcomm.
[3170.56 → 3172.94] It's not that I didn't enjoy my time with the Snapdragon X.
[3173.18 → 3179.32] It's just that if like the are the current gen Intel mobile chips low-key really, really,
[3179.48 → 3179.94] perfect?
[3180.12 → 3182.82] It's a pro premium.
[3183.10 → 3184.26] How expensive is this laptop?
[3184.62 → 3186.06] That one's really expensive.
[3186.28 → 3186.50] Yeah.
[3186.60 → 3190.74] But a big part of why that one is so efficient is that it's using that chip.
[3190.74 → 3195.54] And I think Dell also does some really cool things with their display for optimal efficiency.
[3196.04 → 3197.86] These are not cheap laptops.
[3197.86 → 3201.10] I mean, Snapdragon X is not cheap either, but that is more expensive.
[3201.20 → 3203.78] That's like probably starting at around $2,200 or something like that.
[3203.84 → 3203.96] Yeah.
[3206.56 → 3207.00] No.
[3208.44 → 3209.58] Dan told us to do more topics.
[3209.58 → 3212.10] My mic wasn't live, so you're just crazy.
[3212.24 → 3212.74] That's why I caught the mic.
[3212.74 → 3214.22] Are you trying to take control of the show, Dan?
[3214.22 → 3215.90] That's my job, Lou.
[3216.28 → 3217.78] You made me the new year.
[3217.78 → 3218.28] Okay.
[3218.28 → 3220.06] What are we supposed to be doing?
[3220.24 → 3220.28] Intel.
[3220.28 → 3220.96] I just said.
[3221.04 → 3223.66] Speaking of Intel, they're having a bit of a classic Coke moment.
[3224.44 → 3232.78] Intel just dropped a new 200S Boost BIOS profile for their Arrow Lake CPUs, like the Core Ultra 9 285K,
[3232.92 → 3235.48] letting you safely overclock without killing your warranty.
[3235.48 → 3242.48] Early benchmarks from Der Bauer indicate that it can boost gaming performance by anywhere from 4 to 19%.
[3242.48 → 3244.16] But here's the twist.
[3244.68 → 3251.08] For laptops, most people are still buying older Raptor Lake chips, 13th and 14th gen, because they're cheaper.
[3251.62 → 3258.64] And on the desktop, nobody seems to give a hot gosh darn about the limited AI uses for the new chips,
[3258.72 → 3259.82] and therefore the new chips at all.
[3260.00 → 3261.58] I think that's for laptops as well.
[3261.60 → 3261.76] Oh, for laptops.
[3261.94 → 3262.32] Wait, what?
[3262.32 → 3263.52] Why are we talking about laptops?
[3264.74 → 3265.38] For crying out loud.
[3265.56 → 3266.44] Okay, well, whatever.
[3266.62 → 3269.76] The point is that no one's buying Intel's latest chips.
[3270.50 → 3275.50] Meanwhile, CEO Lip Bhutan announced undisclosed layoffs, but prior to that,
[3275.60 → 3282.04] Bloomberg cited internal sources claiming as much as 20% of Intel's workforce could be laid off in an effort to drive greater simplicity,
[3282.62 → 3285.06] amongst other sweeping cultural changes at Intel.
[3285.06 → 3294.70] Intel's also facing unexpected production shortages for its older Intel 7 process node as demand for these more affordable chips continues to be strong.
[3295.24 → 3298.32] 20% of the workforce is like 20,000 jobs.
[3298.32 → 3307.62] So, okay, some of the stuff that I had kind of put in, some of the stuff that I had put in maybe didn't make it entirely into the dock,
[3308.28 → 3311.88] but basically, yeah, the Intel, oh yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
[3311.90 → 3312.92] I remember what I wanted to do.
[3312.92 → 3320.46] So I wanted to go on, you know, a site like Amazon, okay, Amazon top-selling CPUs,
[3320.46 → 3332.52] and see how deep we have to go in this list to find anyone who's buying these desktop Core Ultra 200 series chips.
[3333.08 → 3335.86] Is anybody buying these things?
[3335.86 → 3339.62] Oh, Crystal asked, what's a Coke moment?
[3340.58 → 3342.32] A new Coke moment.
[3342.90 → 3343.68] Coke classic, new Coke.
[3343.78 → 3349.26] So back in, I think it was the 80s, Coke released new Coke, and everyone hated it.
[3349.68 → 3354.94] And then they got rid of it, and they brought back Coca-Cola Classic.
[3355.04 → 3358.42] That's why it says classic, because that's just like what it was before or something,
[3358.54 → 3360.64] but also with corn syrup now, so I don't know, whatever.
[3360.96 → 3365.04] The point is Coke classic, and then sales skyrocketed.
[3365.04 → 3369.66] So there's like kind of conspiracy theory that they made new Coke sucks on purpose
[3369.66 → 3372.52] so that they could increase sales of Coke Classic.
[3372.64 → 3375.82] I'm not sure if I subscribe to that, but...
[3375.82 → 3380.22] That feels like 17D chess.
[3380.60 → 3380.82] I don't know.
[3382.02 → 3383.58] Apparently new Coke was terrible.
[3383.70 → 3384.40] I never tried it.
[3384.68 → 3388.38] It was dramatically risked the entire company for a crazy move.
[3388.46 → 3389.60] Okay, so...
[3389.60 → 3390.66] It happens, but damn.
[3390.66 → 3391.20] Here we go.
[3391.36 → 3394.00] We finally reached an Intel chip at number eight.
[3394.00 → 3395.82] It is a 12th gen.
[3396.54 → 3401.14] At number nine, we have another Intel chip, a 14th gen processor.
[3404.46 → 3406.38] More Ry zen, more Ry zen.
[3406.70 → 3410.26] We have a 13th gen at number 14th place.
[3411.08 → 3413.48] We have a 14th gen at 16th.
[3413.88 → 3416.60] We have a 14th gen at 18th.
[3416.60 → 3424.62] Okay, we're at number 25 is a micro-tick switch of some sort.
[3426.56 → 3432.12] Core Ultra 7 265K at 29th place.
[3432.86 → 3435.38] To be clear, they're still selling a few of these things.
[3435.46 → 3438.92] It's got 188 reviews, which is something.
[3438.92 → 3449.20] But when we compare that to, you know, like the 1200F, a chip that clearly, you know, used to be a little higher with 1,400 reviews.
[3450.06 → 3452.00] Yeah, it's not a lot.
[3452.42 → 3453.56] It's not a lot, folks.
[3454.22 → 3457.30] 100 reviews on the Core Ultra 9 285K.
[3457.72 → 3460.34] Just 37 on the 245K.
[3460.44 → 3462.24] Clearly people do not care about these things.
[3462.70 → 3463.16] Thousands.
[3463.16 → 3464.44] A lot of AMD at the top.
[3464.62 → 3467.58] On chips that people actually buy, like the 7800X 3D.
[3467.84 → 3469.32] Like here, let's find something.
[3470.14 → 3471.40] Oh, wow, this is embarrassing.
[3471.90 → 3473.56] The 9950X.
[3474.00 → 3477.18] Okay, this is an almost $800 CPU.
[3478.30 → 3485.36] Is outselling Intel's current gen, like, value gaming chip, the 265K.
[3486.92 → 3488.54] It's not even close.
[3489.54 → 3490.54] That's embarrassing.
[3490.54 → 3502.38] More performance, you know, with, you know, overclocking or whatever, BIOS boost, 200S boost profile.
[3503.06 → 3503.46] Great.
[3504.08 → 3506.62] But it just doesn't, it doesn't seem like enough.
[3506.72 → 3510.18] It seems like Arrow Lake is just dead in the water at this point.
[3510.28 → 3512.14] We're on the we're on the US site.
[3513.74 → 3514.66] Or I think so.
[3514.82 → 3516.14] Wait, did it go to .ca?
[3516.74 → 3518.30] I hate it when it does that.
[3519.00 → 3519.50] Forces you.
[3519.50 → 3520.88] I hate it when it does that.
[3520.96 → 3521.16] Yeah.
[3524.08 → 3525.46] No, that was, this was my fault.
[3525.62 → 3526.40] I clicked the wrong thing.
[3527.22 → 3528.68] I did click a .ca link.
[3528.80 → 3529.24] That's my bad.
[3529.34 → 3531.06] Well, anyway, still, my point stands.
[3532.24 → 3532.70] All right.
[3533.00 → 3533.66] Sucks to suck.
[3533.66 → 3540.92] Nokia asks, do you think the ultra CPUs were made on purpose for laptops, but had to release
[3540.92 → 3543.34] them as desktop variants to satisfy a quota of some sort?
[3543.76 → 3548.96] I mean, that's basically, as far as I can tell, been what's driven Intel's CPU development
[3548.96 → 3550.82] since they released, like, Core.
[3550.82 → 3556.46] And that was, that was back in like the mid 2000s was they, they recognized that power
[3556.46 → 3559.54] efficiency was going to matter a lot.
[3559.54 → 3564.10] And then the, the only times that they have sort of deviated from that are when they like
[3564.10 → 3568.98] sucked and had to, had to juice up power just to get performance decent.
[3569.12 → 3571.66] They've, they've been very mobile first for 20 years.
[3571.66 → 3572.62] Oh yeah, definitely.
[3574.88 → 3580.22] Don't forget about, don't forget about server, but that's the funny thing is like enthusiast
[3580.22 → 3585.82] desktop is this one kind of little Island of not caring about power consumption in a
[3585.82 → 3592.20] sea of, of server caring about per core power consumption a lot and mobile caring about per
[3592.20 → 3594.12] core power consumption a lot.
[3594.22 → 3597.64] So we just get whatever's kind of left over.
[3599.20 → 3601.64] We're also like the worst market for them.
[3601.66 → 3603.60] Out of those three, probably, unfortunately.
[3603.76 → 3604.06] Oh yeah.
[3604.14 → 3606.92] The most vocal and cranky and least loyal.
[3607.34 → 3609.82] Like you look at mobile and enterprise, right?
[3610.24 → 3616.64] Like they, they just have regular hardware refreshes that they just, they just buy and
[3616.64 → 3618.32] they don't feel like validating another vendor.
[3618.42 → 3622.98] I mean, that's how Intel has managed to be behind in, in a server performance for years
[3622.98 → 3627.28] at this point, but still maintain greater than 50% market share until I think it was just
[3627.28 → 3629.16] like one quarter ago or something like that.
[3629.16 → 3631.88] Um, there's more to it than just that.
[3631.88 → 3635.66] But a big part of it is once you're, once you're bought into an ecosystem, you just,
[3635.76 → 3637.42] you just reorder it, and you just get the new one.
[3638.78 → 3639.94] Well, good luck Intel.
[3640.44 → 3644.12] Um, Chrome might be for sale.
[3644.12 → 3645.62] Yeah.
[3647.08 → 3651.62] And I don't know if I love the list of people on the buyers.
[3651.92 → 3652.90] Where's our article for this?
[3652.90 → 3653.40] It's at the top.
[3655.62 → 3656.70] Mom, you go ahead and do it.
[3656.70 → 3661.38] Since Google was ruled a search monopoly in last August, the department of justice is
[3661.38 → 3665.52] now seeking a plethora of penalties, including forcing Google to sell Chrome.
[3666.06 → 3675.80] Open AI is 100% interested in the browser, promising an AI first experience that, uh, editorialization
[3675.80 → 3676.62] on the side.
[3676.62 → 3679.82] Uh, we all definitely want, everyone wants that.
[3679.90 → 3681.00] People have been begging for that.
[3681.08 → 3681.50] I want that.
[3682.10 → 3683.08] We all for sure want it.
[3683.08 → 3686.94] I love how when I click in a Google doc and I just try to position my cursor at the top,
[3687.02 → 3688.56] it opens up AI bullshit.
[3688.70 → 3690.60] It's like, Hey, can I help you with this?
[3690.84 → 3691.28] Oh wow.
[3691.42 → 3691.58] Yeah.
[3691.66 → 3693.46] I mean that one, everybody gets one, right?
[3693.62 → 3695.44] How could you possibly help me with this?
[3695.46 → 3697.22] I haven't started typing yet.
[3698.40 → 3699.64] It's a document.
[3699.86 → 3702.00] It's not even a response to an email.
[3702.10 → 3703.06] It's a document.
[3703.06 → 3705.46] We're all, we're all super excited about this.
[3705.52 → 3706.36] Thank you very much.
[3706.42 → 3706.94] Open AI.
[3707.38 → 3710.50] Uh, I think actually this would be great if you did this, please.
[3710.64 → 3711.60] Actually, you know what?
[3712.88 → 3714.56] Maybe, maybe it's good if they do.
[3714.70 → 3715.16] Oh, hold on.
[3715.16 → 3716.24] Because then other browsers might do it.
[3716.24 → 3717.00] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3717.04 → 3718.28] Maybe it doesn't do it in the document.
[3718.40 → 3719.42] Maybe it only does it in emails.
[3720.32 → 3721.88] I'm pretty sure it does it in the document.
[3721.88 → 3723.00] I swear it does too.
[3723.00 → 3724.42] Maybe there needs to be content already in the document.
[3724.42 → 3725.38] Is it just because we're on G Suite?
[3726.28 → 3728.34] No, it does it for my Google Sheets as well.
[3728.40 → 3729.58] Yeah, it does it in the document.
[3729.58 → 3732.06] It might be because you don't have content in there yet or anything.
[3732.16 → 3732.58] I'm not sure.
[3733.06 → 3736.74] But anyway, maybe they do this and then everyone hates it and other people use other browsers
[3736.74 → 3738.70] and that might be good for the world or something.
[3738.80 → 3739.14] We'll see.
[3739.28 → 3741.68] But anyway, they're 100% interested in the browser.
[3741.80 → 3742.20] No, no, no.
[3742.42 → 3742.64] Yeah.
[3742.84 → 3746.54] I have, uh, I have helped me write and generate document.
[3746.72 → 3747.64] They show up right at the top.
[3747.76 → 3750.80] When I have entered nothing into this document yet.
[3750.92 → 3752.06] Because that's what bothers me.
[3752.60 → 3758.72] I, I'm not actually that bothered by AI assisting tools as long as I can just ignore them because
[3758.72 → 3760.30] I don't really personally need them.
[3760.30 → 3764.78] But if I have not entered anything in the document yet.
[3764.98 → 3765.38] Yeah.
[3765.38 → 3769.04] What could you possibly be hoping to autocomplete?
[3770.12 → 3771.00] Generate document.
[3771.64 → 3772.50] Help me write.
[3773.36 → 3774.70] Templates and more.
[3774.90 → 3776.06] To be fair, I can defend that.
[3776.06 → 3776.88] I'm going to generate a document.
[3777.12 → 3778.02] No, I'm going to generate a document.
[3778.02 → 3778.76] I can defend that, yeah.
[3778.80 → 3779.52] Generate document.
[3780.54 → 3781.72] Yeah, it's, it's a wizard.
[3781.92 → 3783.04] That's why it's able to help.
[3783.18 → 3783.80] Oh, well, I hate it.
[3783.80 → 3785.92] Because it's supposed to help people with writer's block.
[3786.02 → 3787.52] That's why it's still there even if there's nothing on the screen.
[3787.52 → 3789.10] But they already have the templates button.
[3789.32 → 3790.60] The thing that drives me nuts is.
[3790.60 → 3791.72] Like, no, this is stupid.
[3791.84 → 3792.96] No, I've maintained it's stupid.
[3793.46 → 3796.64] Generate document asks me if I want to do, what, party planning?
[3796.74 → 3797.48] Hold on, what does it have?
[3797.86 → 3798.92] Do I want to do party planning?
[3799.06 → 3799.62] A newsletter?
[3799.92 → 3800.40] A planning document?
[3800.70 → 3800.92] It's a wizard.
[3801.04 → 3802.06] It doesn't just stop there.
[3802.10 → 3804.54] To launch new strawberry and match whatever?
[3804.78 → 3805.28] Yeah, do it.
[3805.74 → 3806.32] No, I won't.
[3806.32 → 3807.18] You want that for sure.
[3807.18 → 3807.70] I don't want it.
[3807.70 → 3808.64] You want strawberry, match, whatever.
[3808.64 → 3809.66] Okay, I got templates.
[3810.12 → 3812.10] Meeting notes, account plan, blog post.
[3812.10 → 3812.38] Yeah, which is not a wizard.
[3813.20 → 3813.92] Business proposal.
[3813.94 → 3814.60] They're different things!
[3815.76 → 3817.16] I don't like it either, but they're different things.
[3817.54 → 3821.70] The thing that drives me nuts is that all those options are in line with your cursor at the top of the screen.
[3822.22 → 3823.70] Oh, yeah, so I can't click.
[3824.38 → 3825.18] Get out of the way.
[3825.24 → 3826.28] It's so annoying.
[3828.00 → 3828.28] Anyway.
[3828.42 → 3831.56] Like, I don't even, I don't even mind, I don't even mind this up here.
[3831.86 → 3832.66] Yeah, that's fine.
[3832.70 → 3834.22] Like, fine, whatever, be there.
[3834.48 → 3835.48] But, oh, you know what?
[3835.50 → 3836.24] That's probably it.
[3836.24 → 3838.10] I just don't have it activated.
[3838.50 → 3838.92] There we go.
[3838.96 → 3839.52] That's the problem.
[3839.94 → 3841.22] Oh, God, you're going to make me pay.
[3841.66 → 3842.28] Yeah, right.
[3843.10 → 3844.60] Yeah, I mean, I do pay for it.
[3844.60 → 3847.36] Pay for it on my stupid work account.
[3847.44 → 3848.66] Do we have to keep G Suite forever?
[3848.92 → 3849.68] You don't pay for it.
[3850.90 → 3852.60] Oh, Linus Media Group Incorporated does.
[3852.68 → 3852.82] Sorry.
[3852.92 → 3853.06] No.
[3853.40 → 3854.26] We don't pay for Gemini?
[3854.48 → 3855.36] No, we had to.
[3855.62 → 3864.54] They, we got into a little bit of a, you know, Luke interacts with sales employees at large companies' moment.
[3866.24 → 3872.34] We had some back and forth.
[3872.34 → 3880.40] And they didn't give us as much of a discount on our G Suite thing as we had last year because they were really trying to push us to pay for the AI thing.
[3880.50 → 3883.58] But we did, we did not, we did not pay for AI tools.
[3885.16 → 3888.40] And I, they were very pushy about why.
[3888.40 → 3890.40] And I told them.
[3891.62 → 3892.82] And they were good.
[3893.98 → 3895.50] They were pushy about why?
[3895.64 → 3896.06] They're like, why?
[3896.20 → 3896.88] They're so helpful.
[3896.98 → 3897.96] Why don't you want the AI tools?
[3898.08 → 3899.98] And I was like, because they're trash.
[3900.62 → 3901.72] They're so bad.
[3902.22 → 3904.06] Well, it's not even, like, so bad.
[3904.20 → 3904.82] I didn't say trash.
[3904.94 → 3905.84] They're in the way.
[3906.18 → 3906.60] Yeah, they're not good.
[3906.60 → 3908.44] I am trying to get work done.
[3908.90 → 3909.86] They're invasive.
[3910.70 → 3912.44] They're often not helpful yet.
[3912.58 → 3913.22] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3913.34 → 3915.74] Maybe it's a thing in the future, but it's, it's not right now.
[3915.74 → 3917.76] And it's a really expensive per employee.
[3917.88 → 3922.80] So like getting the actual value out of that when there are so many free tools out there.
[3922.88 → 3923.30] Yeah.
[3923.30 → 3925.10] That take almost no additional lift.
[3925.20 → 3925.42] Yeah.
[3925.48 → 3927.22] And in a are a lot of cases better.
[3927.44 → 3927.82] Yeah.
[3928.26 → 3932.46] Gemini is doing well right now, but I mean the whoever's winning the race is, is constantly changing.
[3933.02 → 3936.34] Anyway, OpenAI is interested in buying Chrome.
[3936.84 → 3937.58] Oh, cool.
[3937.58 → 3945.56] They also, they, they even just buy access to Google search index with an exec stating in an
[3945.56 → 3947.38] email that was revealed in the trial.
[3947.56 → 3951.68] We believe having multiple partners and in particular Google's API would enable us to
[3951.68 → 3953.22] provide a better product to users.
[3955.04 → 3960.54] OpenAI has reportedly considered buying its own Chromium based browser, hiring former Google
[3960.54 → 3963.22] developers, Ben Goode.
[3963.44 → 3963.74] Huh?
[3965.64 → 3966.28] Oh, wow.
[3966.66 → 3970.32] And Darren Fisher who helped bring Chrome to market.
[3970.74 → 3972.32] Yahoo, of course.
[3972.50 → 3973.00] Why not?
[3973.00 → 3973.30] Yeah.
[3973.64 → 3974.74] Does Yahoo still exist?
[3975.34 → 3977.16] How does Yahoo still exist?
[3978.16 → 3979.44] I don't understand.
[3979.44 → 3980.20] Who knows?
[3981.08 → 3981.70] Like who's?
[3982.08 → 3984.10] I feel like that would be a wild company to work for.
[3984.12 → 3985.12] Every once in a while.
[3985.24 → 3986.26] Every once in a while.
[3986.26 → 3990.74] I end up on like Yahoo Finance because I need to see like, like the history for a particular
[3990.74 → 3991.78] stock ticker or whatever.
[3991.92 → 3992.06] Yeah.
[3994.74 → 3996.26] Who is using Yahoo?
[3996.86 → 3997.54] I don't know.
[3997.98 → 3998.16] Yeah.
[3998.22 → 3999.72] See, someone said Yahoo Finance is great.
[3999.72 → 3999.94] Yeah.
[3999.94 → 4001.36] It's like the one thing people see.
[4001.36 → 4002.64] I still have Yahoo email.
[4003.38 → 4005.02] My dad uses their email.
[4005.34 → 4007.94] Anytime I see anyone with a Yahoo email, I am.
[4009.18 → 4011.98] I have a really strong like throwback moment.
[4012.22 → 4012.68] Like, wow.
[4012.76 → 4016.02] Like you really, you just have really just dealt with that for a long time.
[4016.06 → 4016.44] Haven't you?
[4016.52 → 4016.94] Like, dang.
[4017.46 → 4018.84] That's not what you were going to say.
[4018.96 → 4019.92] That's so resilient.
[4019.92 → 4022.04] We all know what you were going to say.
[4022.24 → 4023.78] No, they're a very strong person.
[4023.82 → 4024.56] We all.
[4024.56 → 4026.18] Because they have, they have dealt with.
[4026.24 → 4027.86] We all know what you were going to say.
[4027.90 → 4028.84] Why don't you just say it?
[4028.84 → 4030.82] They consider, they consider the impact on everyone in their life.
[4030.82 → 4031.70] Why don't you just say it?
[4031.72 → 4034.50] If they changed emails and how they might be harder to contact.
[4034.64 → 4039.32] So they just, they just stuck through it and, and, and kept using it.
[4039.32 → 4039.70] It's good.
[4039.80 → 4040.16] It's good.
[4040.34 → 4041.14] Very strong person.
[4041.14 → 4041.76] I'm impressed.
[4041.80 → 4043.30] Tears streaming down their face.
[4043.30 → 4049.70] Anyway, Yahoo is looking to run its own browser.
[4049.70 → 4050.60] Cause why not?
[4050.94 → 4053.92] Uh, either through developing or buying one.
[4053.92 → 4059.86] Yahoo search general manager, Brian Profit estimated Yahoo search market share could jump
[4059.86 → 4061.96] from 3% to double digits.
[4061.96 → 4063.62] If they're able to buy Chrome.
[4063.88 → 4064.00] Wow.
[4064.10 → 4064.94] Double digits.
[4065.28 → 4067.52] I would hope it would jump to double digits.
[4067.56 → 4072.58] Also, isn't that just saying that we're going to use the Chrome browser to advantage our
[4072.58 → 4075.84] own search product exactly the same way that Google's doing it.
[4075.86 → 4076.90] Am I missing something here?
[4077.08 → 4078.78] I'm sure I'm missing something here.
[4078.84 → 4080.62] Wasn't there a South Park episode about this?
[4080.84 → 4082.04] Walmart, Jim's drugs.
[4082.94 → 4084.66] It's just going to happen to Yahoo.
[4085.70 → 4086.14] Yeah.
[4087.24 → 4092.00] Honestly, also Yahoo estimating that they have 3% market share seems stunning to me.
[4092.10 → 4092.92] I don't know if that's true.
[4093.10 → 4095.52] I mean, how much of the population of the world is Japan?
[4095.52 → 4098.90] Cause doesn't Japan use Yahoo or something?
[4098.90 → 4102.80] I forgot that might be a thing.
[4102.90 → 4104.44] Uh, handyman says Google is a monopoly.
[4104.66 → 4105.30] Others are not.
[4105.40 → 4113.10] But the thing is that like the same behaviours that turn you into a monopoly are like just
[4113.10 → 4117.28] as wrong when you're not the monopoly, but while you're building toward being a monopoly,
[4117.28 → 4120.32] that's like kind of the whole idea of antitrust.
[4120.84 → 4121.14] Yeah.
[4121.14 → 4126.04] Uh, there's been a little talk of spinning off Chrome into its own independent company
[4126.04 → 4129.84] as Google has contended that Chrome can't survive on its own.
[4130.52 → 4135.64] Um, or sorry, there's been little talk, not there has been a little talk.
[4135.64 → 4141.34] Uh, perplexity actually agrees and would rather Google keep Chrome instead of being forced
[4141.34 → 4143.74] to sell it to another company like OpenAI.
[4144.42 → 4147.16] Perplexity is a competitor to OpenAI, just to be clear.
[4147.40 → 4152.48] However, if a sale is forced, perplexity would like, would be down to buy Chrome as well.
[4153.20 → 4153.60] Obviously.
[4153.84 → 4155.14] They probably just don't have the...
[4155.14 → 4156.86] I'd be down to buy Chrome if I could afford it.
[4157.14 → 4161.22] We should get, we should get all YouTubers together.
[4161.42 → 4162.62] We can make our own browser if you want.
[4162.68 → 4163.64] And buy Chrome.
[4163.78 → 4164.36] Surprisingly easy.
[4164.40 → 4165.10] We should just buy Chrome.
[4165.48 → 4165.80] Nice.
[4168.26 → 4168.74] Why?
[4168.74 → 4177.04] If every one of our viewers contributed $1, YouTubers could buy Chrome from Google
[4177.04 → 4179.36] and then we could own Chrome.
[4180.68 → 4181.06] Why?
[4182.14 → 4185.34] Because Chrome is what you use to watch YouTube.
[4185.68 → 4186.20] Okay.
[4187.00 → 4188.12] But you can watch it on other browsers.
[4188.12 → 4193.76] If you are a dinosaur, and you're not already watching on your phone or your TV or Firefox.
[4194.16 → 4194.88] Yeah, that's true.
[4194.88 → 4196.82] Well, people don't watch YouTube on Firefox.
[4196.82 → 4197.88] They watch float plane on Firefox.
[4197.88 → 4201.40] You'd only be buying it for like millennials that are still using computers.
[4202.12 → 4202.32] Yeah.
[4202.68 → 4203.08] Oh.
[4203.36 → 4204.94] Yeah, to buy their airplane tickets.
[4208.04 → 4208.94] No, that's a thing.
[4209.16 → 4209.84] No, I agree.
[4210.00 → 4210.52] Yeah, that's a thing.
[4210.84 → 4213.04] Do not make me buy airplane tickets on a phone, dude.
[4213.14 → 4213.60] No, I can't.
[4213.66 → 4214.92] I will go on a computer.
[4215.16 → 4215.54] I can't.
[4215.64 → 4218.30] We were shopping for Yvonne's getting a new car.
[4218.96 → 4220.44] Big purchases need big screen.
[4220.54 → 4224.52] We were shopping for it, and I was trying to look at it on the phone, and it's fine, but
[4224.52 → 4225.30] I can't compare.
[4225.52 → 4225.96] Yeah.
[4226.06 → 4227.30] I need to compare.
[4227.30 → 4227.70] Yeah.
[4227.74 → 4232.30] So we ended up at her desktop with a nice big ultra-wide monitor with the spreadsheet
[4232.30 → 4233.58] with all the links.
[4233.80 → 4236.80] You were talking earlier in the show about how Gen Z is much more gullible.
[4237.04 → 4244.46] Is this part of why the tools that they have don't naturally lend themselves to like comparisons?
[4244.46 → 4248.02] And they're not, maybe they're just not accustomed to making comparisons.
[4248.80 → 4250.54] I could kind of, I could kind of see that.
[4250.66 → 4253.46] Like the friction to make a comparison on desktop.
[4253.66 → 4257.52] I mean, we've had Aero snap on Windows for like 20 years or whatever, right?
[4257.52 → 4258.88] The computer almost wants you to do it.
[4259.26 → 4259.56] Yeah.
[4259.64 → 4262.32] You just, you take your one thing, and you throw it on the one side.
[4262.38 → 4263.72] You take your other thing, you throw it on the other side.
[4263.72 → 4264.40] And your computer's like, yeah!
[4264.88 → 4265.78] And you make comparisons.
[4266.08 → 4266.92] Whereas phones.
[4267.88 → 4268.50] No, it sucks.
[4268.64 → 4269.04] Yeah, it sucks.
[4269.04 → 4269.68] It's a bad experience.
[4269.82 → 4270.02] Terrible.
[4270.02 → 4272.08] Switching tabs in your browser and your phone sucks.
[4272.98 → 4274.22] Unless you have Samsung DEX.
[4275.18 → 4275.76] Oh, come on.
[4276.64 → 4281.38] That's a very high friction to go take your phone somewhere and plug it into something.
[4281.74 → 4282.12] Yeah.
[4282.26 → 4283.98] I mean, I'm not being serious.
[4284.24 → 4284.60] I see.
[4285.26 → 4285.68] I see.
[4285.78 → 4287.58] You should be serious about our sponsors.
[4287.82 → 4287.98] Yeah.
[4289.02 → 4291.22] BBBB99 says split screen on a phone is awful.
[4291.26 → 4291.84] It really is.
[4292.08 → 4292.50] Let's try.
[4292.68 → 4296.26] It's one of those things that I basically ignored anytime I was reviewing a phone.
[4296.36 → 4296.84] Yeah, it sucks.
[4296.84 → 4297.78] I just don't use it.
[4297.92 → 4298.30] Like what?
[4298.38 → 4299.86] I want an even smaller screen.
[4299.86 → 4300.78] You got to be kidding me.
[4301.00 → 4301.36] Cool.
[4301.42 → 4305.98] I can look at the tire on this one car and the tire on this other car and compare it that
[4305.98 → 4306.52] way.
[4306.84 → 4308.54] Yeah, I think that's actually a pretty good point.
[4310.10 → 4313.78] And like, no, Ados in float plane chat says, no, they're just lazy.
[4313.94 → 4315.50] People don't want to self-educate anymore.
[4315.72 → 4316.62] I don't think that's it.
[4316.66 → 4318.54] I think they are self-educating.
[4318.72 → 4322.72] So we're trying to figure out like what is the like you've identified the disease,
[4322.84 → 4326.88] but we're trying to figure out like, you know, what infected them.
[4327.00 → 4327.16] Yeah.
[4327.16 → 4329.26] You know, like where did this disease come from?
[4330.22 → 4330.62] Why?
[4333.78 → 4335.14] Apparently there is DEX wireless.
[4335.52 → 4335.74] Okay.
[4335.78 → 4336.42] You could do that.
[4336.82 → 4338.00] But my.
[4338.14 → 4339.16] You're still just sitting at a computer.
[4339.30 → 4339.84] It's not the point.
[4339.92 → 4343.16] And the habit, the habit of whenever you do things.
[4343.32 → 4343.88] What have you done?
[4344.08 → 4344.48] Hold on.
[4344.58 → 4345.20] I'm sorry.
[4345.20 → 4349.54] The issue is that they don't have the habit of going and sitting down at a computer to
[4349.54 → 4349.96] do something.
[4349.96 → 4353.42] So they're not going to do that regardless of whether it's sitting down at Samsung DEX or
[4353.42 → 4355.54] sitting down at a gaming desktop or whatever else.
[4355.54 → 4357.26] It's just that that was our habit.
[4357.26 → 4362.50] When we needed to do something, when we needed to buy something online, we would, we would go
[4362.50 → 4363.68] to the computer and send.
[4363.82 → 4365.14] So it's just ingrained in us.
[4365.14 → 4368.98] I can buy things online and I will.
[4368.98 → 4376.04] I'll if I'm just grabbing some like hooks for my wall to hang things in my garage, whatever.
[4376.20 → 4377.64] I'm I'll just like go.
[4377.72 → 4381.22] I'll just find the first thing because it doesn't make much of a difference if I pay
[4381.22 → 4383.74] three dollars for it or five dollars.
[4383.74 → 4388.00] Like, yeah, on one of them, I'm paying 66 percent more, but I don't I don't care.
[4388.00 → 4389.24] I'm making a quick decision.
[4389.76 → 4390.84] OK, I found this.
[4390.90 → 4391.80] It ships into.
[4392.14 → 4392.94] OK, boom, done.
[4393.00 → 4393.80] Google Pay done.
[4394.24 → 4394.48] Right.
[4394.54 → 4399.72] But for something like you said, flights, vehicles, houses, I'm at my desktop.
[4399.86 → 4400.40] I got to be.
[4400.90 → 4404.28] And that's just like not a thing for the younger generation, apparently.
[4405.06 → 4407.60] So good luck on your sale of Chrome, Google.
[4411.86 → 4413.14] Our discussion question.
[4413.14 → 4417.34] Is consumer welfare really the best lens to look at antitrust through if breaking up
[4417.34 → 4422.26] Google only results in different bazillion dollar companies turning surveillance capitalism
[4422.26 → 4422.82] up to 11?
[4424.16 → 4431.72] Yeah, it's interesting that it's like extremely ethically gray AI companies and Yahoo for some
[4431.72 → 4434.82] reason are the only ones seemingly jumping on this.
[4436.88 → 4442.52] I mean, yeah, who would want to own all your browsing data other than someone who wants to
[4442.52 → 4444.08] capitalize on it?
[4444.08 → 4444.22] Right.
[4444.26 → 4446.36] Like there's no good guy is going to want Chrome.
[4447.30 → 4450.76] And you're not going to make a pricing model for Chrome itself.
[4450.86 → 4454.24] That was my point with the YouTubers buying it and him being like, why?
[4454.36 → 4455.50] And that's exactly it.
[4455.64 → 4456.08] Why?
[4456.32 → 4456.52] Yeah.
[4456.60 → 4461.08] There's no reason unless you just like want to own the Internet and own Internet standards
[4461.08 → 4462.34] and all of that.
[4463.00 → 4463.24] Yeah.
[4463.24 → 4465.76] What are we supposed to be doing right now, Mr. Dan?
[4465.84 → 4466.54] Oh, sponsors.
[4466.72 → 4468.78] The show is brought to you by Dennis.
[4469.70 → 4470.56] Oh, Messi.
[4471.16 → 4473.62] I wear sandals all the time.
[4473.98 → 4476.66] But our sponsor Messi wasn't having it.
[4476.88 → 4481.34] So they sent Dennis to my house to uncover the truth behind my sandal obsession.
[4481.34 → 4484.78] It took him over 20 seconds to put on my sandals.
[4485.48 → 4488.22] Meanwhile, he can slip right into a pair of Versus.
[4489.28 → 4491.38] Maybe the sandals can keep your socks dry?
[4492.24 → 4492.52] Nope.
[4493.04 → 4494.28] Another point for Messi.
[4495.04 → 4495.48] Style?
[4496.08 → 4497.66] Well, here I think the winner's obvious.
[4498.80 → 4500.12] Messi has all kinds of styles.
[4500.38 → 4502.82] Sneakers, slip-ons, boots, and more.
[4503.08 → 4504.46] Oh, and their weekend sneakers?
[4504.96 → 4506.16] Dennis's favourite travel shoes.
[4506.72 → 4507.58] He's worn them everywhere.
[4507.58 → 4512.14] From strolling through Thailand to racking up 20,000 steps a day in Tokyo.
[4512.52 → 4514.72] With a thicker, cushioned midsole and a relaxed fit,
[4514.96 → 4517.98] they'll have your feet feeling like it's the weekend all year round.

[4662.60 → 4665.06] So, there's that.
[4666.72 → 4668.84] I don't know why they asked me to clarify that.
[4670.22 → 4673.86] It's been a very long time, I think, since any browser has been case-sensitive.
[4674.74 → 4675.02] Yeah.
[4675.02 → 4676.90] All right.
[4677.02 → 4678.66] What else?
[4678.80 → 4679.34] What else?
[4679.40 → 4680.68] You want to talk about Oblivion?
[4681.58 → 4682.72] Or did you kind of already?
[4682.92 → 4684.24] Or, like, what's your deal there?
[4684.42 → 4685.06] We can.
[4685.32 → 4686.20] There are more announcements.
[4686.32 → 4687.46] How do we want to deal with that?
[4688.64 → 4689.34] Yeah, why not?
[4689.50 → 4689.96] Oh, no.
[4690.08 → 4691.02] No, we already...
[4691.02 → 4693.56] Guys, we have to do actual topics at some point.
[4693.64 → 4694.66] Why are you pressuring me?
[4694.68 → 4695.82] Let's talk about Oblivion, then.
[4696.32 → 4697.02] Okay, I have to pee.
[4697.38 → 4698.02] Where's the...
[4698.02 → 4705.68] Bethesda Shadow Drops, the Oblivion remaster, and everyone liked that.
[4706.10 → 4706.74] Kind of.
[4707.86 → 4710.42] There are some sources here from Game Squad and PC Gamer.
[4710.56 → 4713.10] A lot of places have talked about this.
[4713.76 → 4714.76] The notes say,
[4714.76 → 4717.14] Like an arrow to the knee of my free time,
[4717.48 → 4720.72] the Oblivion remaster was announced and released with one trailer
[4720.72 → 4723.56] and two game engines, which I'll explain in a moment.
[4723.56 → 4727.84] It got over 150,000 concurrent players on Steam on the first day,
[4727.96 → 4730.64] despite having effectively no advertising,
[4731.06 → 4735.26] and also despite the fact that it is free on Game Pass.
[4735.72 → 4741.08] Reddit slash r slash Oblivion Abominations has gone wild
[4741.08 → 4744.66] with all the characters that people are making.
[4746.20 → 4747.44] Oh, yes.
[4748.16 → 4750.44] Oblivion character creator is fantastic.
[4751.20 → 4751.64] Wow.
[4751.64 → 4754.18] Someone made Pot of Greed.
[4754.62 → 4755.22] Oh, boy.
[4757.18 → 4758.12] Oh, man.
[4759.60 → 4760.20] Oh, nice.
[4760.28 → 4760.66] Squidward.
[4760.92 → 4761.58] Let's go.
[4762.58 → 4762.78] Ooh.
[4764.08 → 4764.60] Anyway.
[4764.96 → 4765.54] Good stuff.
[4765.90 → 4766.68] Oblivion's great.
[4768.26 → 4772.80] Bethesda also gave free keys to the entire Oblivion dev team.
[4773.80 → 4775.34] It says in here,
[4775.40 → 4779.56] To make them feel a little less sad about wasting years of their lives.
[4779.56 → 4781.18] Oh, my God.
[4781.18 → 4783.16] Many, many, many years of their lives.
[4783.40 → 4785.08] Also, someone posted this,
[4786.18 → 4790.08] which, honestly, I didn't.
[4792.88 → 4794.98] I might this weekend, but I didn't.
[4795.10 → 4798.44] The first thing, the literal first thing that I heard about it,
[4798.68 → 4800.16] that wasn't just a rumour,
[4800.52 → 4803.12] was that NPCs didn't have schedules anymore.
[4803.12 → 4807.00] And what I really liked back in the day was being a sneaky little thief guy
[4807.00 → 4808.18] and stealing everything.
[4808.72 → 4812.18] And my favourite quest chains were the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild.
[4812.88 → 4815.68] And by far, my favourite quest chain in a Borrowing was,
[4815.84 → 4818.70] in regard to the factions, was the Thieves Guild.
[4818.70 → 4823.70] So, without schedules, I was like, what the heck?
[4823.98 → 4825.90] And then somebody corrected that for me,
[4826.14 → 4827.58] and apparently they do have schedules.
[4827.74 → 4829.14] So I don't know where that rumour came from,
[4829.22 → 4832.12] because once I first heard that,
[4832.42 → 4833.62] I looked it up and found it.
[4833.92 → 4835.34] Quite a few people saying it,
[4835.40 → 4836.92] but they do seem to have schedules.
[4837.42 → 4839.00] I think the confusion there
[4839.00 → 4842.44] might be tied into that one trailer, two engines comment that was made,
[4842.44 → 4849.88] because the UE5 engine is just dealing with the graphics.
[4850.08 → 4852.40] The game logic is still being run by,
[4852.82 → 4853.62] what is it called?
[4853.74 → 4854.18] Game brio?
[4854.80 → 4855.62] Something like that.
[4855.64 → 4856.50] I think it's Game brio,
[4856.80 → 4859.44] the engine that was originally used for Oblivion,
[4859.68 → 4861.98] which has created, in my opinion,
[4862.12 → 4864.22] a pretty fantastic result, actually,
[4864.44 → 4866.10] because I was very standoffish.
[4866.76 → 4868.30] First, I was,
[4868.30 → 4871.46] even with it being out now,
[4871.50 → 4872.52] and now I do own it,
[4872.92 → 4875.38] I was much more interested in,
[4875.68 → 4876.44] and still am,
[4876.52 → 4879.32] much more interested in the Oblivion project
[4879.32 → 4880.88] that's still coming this year.
[4881.44 → 4884.06] And I'll probably be diving in more so to that.
[4884.14 → 4885.78] I'm going to dabble with this remaster,
[4885.94 → 4888.70] but I don't know if I'm going to fully try to beat the game or anything.
[4889.28 → 4892.54] And I'll be more interested in the Oblivion remaster.
[4892.54 → 4896.78] But, yeah,
[4896.92 → 4898.52] there were a bunch of things that put me off.
[4898.60 → 4899.76] There's the schedules' thing.
[4900.32 → 4902.02] I heard that in the EULA,
[4902.14 → 4903.32] they talked down on mods,
[4903.40 → 4906.44] but apparently they're not against mods at all.
[4907.42 → 4909.22] And Nexus mods,
[4909.38 → 4909.76] I believe,
[4909.86 → 4910.78] already has like,
[4911.38 → 4913.16] I think Barrington was saying last night,
[4913.26 → 4916.36] that they already have like hundreds of mods for the game,
[4916.42 → 4917.96] and it's been out for days.
[4918.32 → 4920.16] I've heard a lot of them are drag and drop,
[4920.16 → 4923.16] because it's the same as core engine in a way.
[4924.36 → 4926.32] That makes so much sense.
[4926.38 → 4929.34] So it should be a little more approachable than something like,
[4929.54 → 4934.22] I think SE took a while to get in because it was slightly different.
[4934.88 → 4938.26] And then Skyrim VR also was very difficult,
[4938.44 → 4938.94] if I remember.
[4939.32 → 4939.44] Yeah,
[4939.48 → 4942.20] so there are 529 mods already,
[4942.52 → 4944.90] which is pretty wild.
[4944.90 → 4948.52] And there are some things that is like kind of broken,
[4948.74 → 4950.40] like I couldn't go to 1440p.
[4951.20 → 4951.56] Oh,
[4951.60 → 4952.60] I already clicked away from it.
[4952.88 → 4953.76] And now it's on steak.
[4953.90 → 4954.60] Why are you on steak?
[4954.62 → 4955.56] I must have clicked an ad.
[4955.68 → 4956.42] I thought you were vegetarian.
[4956.78 → 4957.66] Oh my god.
[4958.12 → 4958.92] Gambling vegetarian.
[4962.52 → 4965.08] I eat unknown mushrooms or something.
[4967.96 → 4968.28] Anyway,
[4968.80 → 4969.20] yeah,
[4969.32 → 4973.28] but apparently there's like an INI fix that you can use to solve that and stuff.
[4973.28 → 4973.68] But anyway,
[4974.22 → 4974.92] it seems cool.
[4975.10 → 4979.28] And something that I really appreciate about it is that it has the same quirks that it used to have,
[4979.36 → 4981.12] because the underlying engine is still Gambia,
[4981.26 → 4984.48] despite UE5 taking over the visualization stuff.
[4984.66 → 4992.08] There's some funk on like how the colour palette and lighting works is different and more tame than the original Oblivion,
[4992.14 → 4993.28] because the original Oblivion was like...
[4994.20 → 4995.12] Bloom up the butt.
[4995.14 → 4995.28] Bloom everywhere,
[4996.24 → 4997.28] and everything's glowing all the time.
[4997.28 → 4997.88] That's a good thing.
[4998.16 → 4999.58] So if you want that back,
[4999.62 → 5000.74] you can mod that back in.
[5000.96 → 5002.74] I think the game probably looks better.
[5002.74 → 5004.12] I've washed more than just my hands.
[5004.20 → 5005.12] I washed my whole arm.
[5005.20 → 5005.28] Here,
[5005.32 → 5005.60] check out.
[5006.88 → 5007.56] You did?
[5008.02 → 5008.30] Yep.
[5010.46 → 5010.90] Why?
[5013.00 → 5013.44] Cool.
[5014.04 → 5014.68] But yeah,
[5014.74 → 5015.70] it seems cool.
[5015.84 → 5018.24] I am still more interested in Oblivion,
[5018.38 → 5021.06] and I recommend that you guys still look forward towards that project,
[5021.24 → 5023.74] and maybe don't tap yourself out on the remaster,
[5023.98 → 5024.74] because Oblivion,
[5025.48 → 5025.98] in my opinion,
[5026.02 → 5026.66] just looks better.
[5026.66 → 5030.90] that team is being very gracious right now,
[5031.00 → 5031.38] I think.
[5032.10 → 5033.38] They've made multiple posts.
[5033.54 → 5036.68] Thank you for not shutting down our project that we've been working on for years.
[5038.22 → 5040.62] We will never make fun of your games again,
[5040.98 → 5041.94] even though they are trash.
[5042.62 → 5042.90] Well,
[5043.00 → 5043.70] they used to be good.
[5044.60 → 5045.26] This one was.
[5045.46 → 5047.00] Some of the newer ones are not as good,
[5047.12 → 5048.04] but thank you so much.
[5048.10 → 5048.38] Also,
[5048.50 → 5050.26] are you ever going to do a new Elder Scrolls game?
[5050.26 → 5053.00] Remaking Oblivion doesn't really count.
[5053.08 → 5053.82] That's what we were doing.
[5056.28 → 5058.80] They did have an outside studio did the work on this.
[5059.10 → 5059.46] Virtuous.
[5061.44 → 5062.66] I think it's Virtuous.
[5062.96 → 5063.14] Was that?
[5064.22 → 5065.74] Landis found a quarter on the toilet.
[5066.12 → 5066.78] Something like that.
[5067.08 → 5068.72] That would be a great reason.
[5071.48 → 5072.00] But yeah,
[5072.04 → 5072.36] I don't know.
[5072.44 → 5072.96] It's cool.
[5073.20 → 5077.36] I think there's a lot of people going with the like,
[5077.36 → 5080.66] this is an example of how new games suck now.
[5082.30 → 5082.98] I mean,
[5083.06 → 5083.84] Oblivion kind of sucks.
[5083.94 → 5085.44] It's literally the original horse armour.
[5086.30 → 5086.96] It is the original.
[5087.08 → 5087.96] There's new horse armour.
[5088.22 → 5088.56] Oh,
[5088.66 → 5092.38] that was the other reason why I didn't exactly want to jump on it right away.
[5092.78 → 5094.74] Was that they sold horse armour again.
[5095.08 → 5095.38] I don't know.
[5095.46 → 5096.30] Did you see this?
[5096.54 → 5096.90] No.
[5098.38 → 5099.38] Oblivion Remastered.
[5099.44 → 5101.08] So if you look at the Steam page,
[5101.98 → 5102.54] oh,
[5102.74 → 5103.28] hold on.
[5103.92 → 5104.32] Whoop.
[5104.38 → 5105.38] This is not lying.
[5105.62 → 5106.26] Let's go.
[5106.26 → 5111.14] If you go to the Steam page, and you scroll down,
[5111.28 → 5117.96] they make it look like the deluxe edition is needed for the expansions.
[5119.26 → 5119.78] Oh,
[5119.86 → 5120.32] interesting.
[5120.70 → 5121.96] Because you go up here, and you're,
[5122.10 → 5122.24] okay,
[5122.28 → 5124.42] I'm buying Oblivion Remastered.
[5124.42 → 5124.78] Yeah.
[5124.98 → 5125.54] I scroll down.
[5125.62 → 5127.26] It doesn't say up here like,
[5127.36 → 5127.44] oh,
[5127.44 → 5129.30] it includes the expansions by the way.
[5129.30 → 5130.08] Buy it or buy the deluxe edition.
[5130.62 → 5131.20] Oh my God.
[5131.32 → 5134.06] They want 50 US dollars for this game.
[5134.58 → 5135.16] It's a lot.
[5135.16 → 5136.64] Or is it less than that?
[5136.68 → 5137.12] Is it 40?
[5137.22 → 5137.96] I think it's less than that.
[5138.38 → 5138.74] 45?
[5139.10 → 5139.42] I don't know.
[5139.48 → 5139.96] Whatever it is.
[5139.98 → 5140.20] Either way.
[5140.20 → 5140.40] Okay.
[5141.10 → 5141.86] You scroll down,
[5141.90 → 5142.56] you see this.
[5142.64 → 5146.84] And this is the first time that I saw Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine mentioned at
[5146.84 → 5147.12] all,
[5147.36 → 5147.74] personally.
[5150.16 → 5151.66] But no.
[5151.90 → 5152.22] Huh.
[5152.36 → 5152.84] So I was like,
[5152.92 → 5153.22] okay,
[5153.48 → 5155.18] so if I want Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine,
[5155.30 → 5157.92] I have to buy horse armour effectively.
[5158.70 → 5159.02] Hilarious.
[5159.02 → 5159.54] That sucks.
[5159.70 → 5162.50] So I refused to buy it originally because I was just like,
[5162.56 → 5163.24] there's no way.
[5163.40 → 5164.40] I'm not doing that.
[5164.70 → 5165.32] No chance.
[5166.44 → 5169.92] Turns out the base game does have the expansions,
[5170.40 → 5175.22] but a ton of people didn't even know that because this is super misleading.
[5175.48 → 5177.06] So bought the deluxe edition,
[5177.20 → 5179.18] effectively just buying some armour,
[5179.34 → 5182.46] some weapons and horse armour along with an art book and a soundtrack.
[5182.46 → 5184.26] Technically what they're saying is true.
[5185.02 → 5188.54] The deluxe edition does include the expansions.
[5189.36 → 5189.82] Yeah,
[5189.88 → 5190.20] it does.
[5190.32 → 5191.14] So this is,
[5191.20 → 5192.36] they just don't point out like,
[5192.48 → 5196.56] and digital deluxe content technically is some armour,
[5196.68 → 5197.70] weapons and horse armour.
[5198.44 → 5200.08] Everything they say is true.
[5200.16 → 5200.60] To me,
[5200.66 → 5202.10] there's a lot of misleading stuff about this.
[5202.22 → 5202.36] No,
[5202.40 → 5202.48] no,
[5202.48 → 5202.56] no,
[5202.56 → 5203.76] I'm not saying it's not misleading.
[5203.96 → 5206.96] I'm just saying it is technically factual.
[5208.46 → 5208.94] The
[5209.00 → 5209.38] the
[5209.54 → 5210.56] in the border,
[5210.56 → 5213.28] I know they say digital deluxe content on the right.
[5213.86 → 5215.04] And then over here,
[5215.04 → 5215.76] it says includes,
[5215.76 → 5220.30] but the border around the base game is different from the border around the other two things.
[5220.42 → 5220.78] A hundred percent.
[5220.88 → 5222.50] Like it really feels like it is.
[5222.62 → 5222.88] And then I,
[5222.88 → 5224.26] I don't think.
[5227.08 → 5227.48] Yeah.
[5227.48 → 5228.08] Like under here,
[5228.08 → 5229.36] you look at what it includes.
[5229.62 → 5230.92] It details the base game.
[5230.96 → 5232.30] And then way separate from that,
[5232.36 → 5234.88] it says shivering owls and nights of the night expansion.
[5235.08 → 5235.54] It really does.
[5236.20 → 5237.02] And it's just,
[5237.10 → 5240.30] I don't see it mentioned anywhere else that it does include those in the base game.
[5240.30 → 5242.18] So that was another reason why I held off.
[5242.46 → 5243.32] But then I figured out that.
[5243.32 → 5243.64] That's cray.
[5243.76 → 5243.92] Yeah,
[5243.98 → 5244.84] it was just misleading,
[5245.02 → 5245.88] but it does include it.
[5245.90 → 5246.18] So no,
[5246.24 → 5248.58] I didn't get the digital deluxe because screw that noise.
[5248.64 → 5249.56] I'm not buying horse armour.
[5250.22 → 5251.52] How will your horse be armoured?
[5251.98 → 5253.80] The funny thing about horse armour in the game,
[5253.82 → 5256.98] and one of their justifications for it was that it is in fact purely cosmetic.
[5256.98 → 5257.94] It does not,
[5258.10 → 5258.50] in fact,
[5258.64 → 5259.46] armour your horse.
[5259.96 → 5261.44] And your horse can get attacked.
[5261.76 → 5262.04] Yes,
[5262.12 → 5262.82] very much so.
[5262.92 → 5265.10] Your horse can become very unlived.
[5265.22 → 5266.26] Literally doesn't help you.
[5266.26 → 5272.66] They say it's all DLC was included in their presentation when they shadow dropped it.
[5273.06 → 5275.10] So this is piss poor self-education.
[5275.42 → 5277.30] That's a hilarious take in my opinion,
[5277.40 → 5281.28] because you're now saying that everyone that should buy this has to watch their presentation.
[5281.28 → 5282.98] That is a comically bad take.
[5283.14 → 5284.60] Which is actually hilarious,
[5284.60 → 5286.48] and not how like people work,
[5286.58 → 5288.32] or really anything works.
[5288.46 → 5289.30] That's brutal.
[5290.18 → 5290.68] Whiskey nerd,
[5290.76 → 5291.22] we love you.
[5291.22 → 5292.68] Thank you for subscribing to Float plane,
[5292.76 → 5294.02] but that is a terrible take.
[5294.08 → 5294.56] And again,
[5294.68 → 5297.62] I did end up figuring out how it worked,
[5297.66 → 5299.00] and did end up buying it.
[5299.08 → 5300.98] So I think the self-education was fine.
[5301.16 → 5302.20] It just shouldn't be that hard.
[5302.58 → 5302.92] Yeah.
[5303.14 → 5304.08] It's a little ridiculous.
[5304.48 → 5305.96] But it's doing super well.
[5306.04 → 5307.08] They have tons of players,
[5307.70 → 5309.58] and I think they should be happy.
[5309.58 → 5315.62] I am at least partially holding back for the Oblivion version,
[5315.62 → 5318.58] which I will be very excited about.
[5319.96 → 5321.48] I had to put my ointment back on.
[5321.96 → 5323.60] So I washed off the residue.
[5323.60 → 5324.02] I knew,
[5324.16 → 5325.36] because I saw it on you earlier,
[5325.48 → 5327.56] but I was prepping you to say,
[5327.64 → 5327.94] anyway,
[5328.00 → 5328.36] it's fine.
[5328.86 → 5329.44] My ointment.
[5330.04 → 5330.36] Aha!
[5330.46 → 5330.94] I got him!
[5331.20 → 5331.88] LMG Sammy.
[5331.98 → 5332.94] I bought the deluxe edition,
[5333.04 → 5334.66] because I thought the horse armour meme was funny,
[5334.98 → 5336.10] and I wanted the cool armour,
[5336.22 → 5336.96] but I don't know how to get it.
[5336.98 → 5337.50] It's a quest,
[5337.70 → 5337.90] Sammy.
[5338.20 → 5338.40] No,
[5338.64 → 5338.88] Sammy.
[5342.88 → 5344.38] I thought you bought it for the expansions.
[5344.38 → 5344.82] Yeah.
[5344.82 → 5348.34] That was not the vindication that you thought it was.
[5348.34 → 5349.52] It was actually just sadder.
[5349.58 → 5352.12] Maybe you just didn't self-educate on what Sammy said.
[5352.18 → 5352.54] That's true.
[5352.62 → 5354.06] I didn't finish reading it before I reacted.
[5355.34 → 5356.34] Classic influencer.
[5356.64 → 5357.18] My bad.
[5357.20 → 5359.30] That's why everybody f***ING hates them.
[5359.74 → 5360.76] It's worse, though.
[5360.86 → 5362.90] What he said is just actually worse, I think.
[5362.92 → 5363.30] I know.
[5364.04 → 5365.10] I don't know what to do with him.
[5365.32 → 5367.00] How do you spend more money on a company?
[5367.18 → 5367.78] On the one hand,
[5367.82 → 5368.66] he does a great job.
[5368.90 → 5369.10] He does.
[5369.10 → 5369.80] On the other hand,
[5369.90 → 5372.00] he's definitely going to come to Softball Night this year,
[5372.00 → 5373.78] and I f***ING hate that.
[5373.78 → 5378.14] Dude, he's infuriating.
[5379.18 → 5380.00] Why is that?
[5380.22 → 5383.26] It's like he's trying to make me lose.
[5385.10 → 5385.84] It's Softball.
[5385.94 → 5386.46] I want to win.
[5387.04 → 5388.14] Softball is very competitive.
[5388.30 → 5389.24] Company Softball events.
[5389.26 → 5391.36] Is this because he goes on your team too much,
[5391.42 → 5392.18] and he's bad,
[5392.26 → 5393.28] or is it because he's perfect,
[5393.32 → 5393.64] and he goes on the other team?
[5393.64 → 5395.98] He's a pure agent of chaos.
[5395.98 → 5399.16] He ran over Ariana.
[5399.32 → 5400.36] Yeah, I was there for that.
[5400.42 → 5403.06] Literally plowed her over.
[5403.12 → 5403.72] Bled right through.
[5404.10 → 5404.40] Yeah.
[5404.66 → 5404.90] Yeah.
[5405.14 → 5406.98] You never want to plow the head of HR.
[5406.98 → 5407.66] Soft person in the way.
[5408.30 → 5409.98] Wasn't in that much of a hurry, really.
[5410.08 → 5411.52] Well, he was, but didn't need to be.
[5413.62 → 5414.80] I never lost.
[5415.16 → 5417.12] Is he flawless win rate?
[5418.28 → 5419.92] I don't believe him.
[5419.94 → 5420.94] Has he only been there once?
[5421.02 → 5421.70] I don't believe him.
[5422.68 → 5423.94] No, no, he's been there more than once.
[5424.04 → 5424.66] Oh, no, yeah, you know,
[5424.68 → 5425.64] he comes pretty regularly.
[5425.80 → 5427.52] Sammy, I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[5427.78 → 5428.32] By the way,
[5429.18 → 5431.76] Chewy's organizing a batting cage thing.
[5432.24 → 5433.16] Get in touch so that maybe
[5433.16 → 5434.32] you'll actually hit something this year.
[5437.02 → 5437.64] It'll be great.
[5437.76 → 5438.12] We'll have fun.
[5438.92 → 5439.14] He said,
[5439.22 → 5440.42] I might not go this year, lol.
[5440.58 → 5441.18] What are you, weak?
[5442.10 → 5442.34] Oh.
[5443.90 → 5444.80] I'll see you there.
[5448.40 → 5448.88] All right.
[5450.26 → 5451.14] Okay, what else we got?
[5452.18 → 5452.54] Uh,
[5453.62 → 5454.48] plenty of things.
[5454.52 → 5455.50] Oh, we do need a ding-emote.
[5456.50 → 5457.26] We need a bell.
[5457.92 → 5458.24] Emote?
[5458.50 → 5460.02] Yeah, how do we not have a ding-emote
[5460.02 → 5461.72] in the flow plane chat?
[5462.34 → 5463.82] What, is your team not like doing work,
[5463.86 → 5464.14] or what?
[5465.10 → 5467.02] Sorry, I'm just feeling kind of aggressive right now.
[5469.28 → 5470.18] They are doing work.
[5470.28 → 5472.06] They're doing work on things we can't talk about.
[5472.98 → 5473.72] Oh, like what?
[5474.94 → 5475.54] Good stuff.
[5476.12 → 5476.36] Yeah?
[5476.64 → 5476.88] Mm-hmm.
[5477.34 → 5477.66] Good?
[5477.98 → 5478.22] Yep.
[5478.22 → 5478.62] You sure?
[5478.96 → 5479.12] Yep.
[5479.12 → 5480.76] Dude, this was actually,
[5481.14 → 5483.62] this week was kind of awesome.
[5484.18 → 5486.38] Um, I don't know if we've revealed this yet,
[5486.44 → 5487.72] but whatever, I'm going to do it.
[5487.88 → 5490.08] Uh, we shot a collab with Kitbag.
[5490.42 → 5490.60] Mm.
[5491.08 → 5492.60] That was so much fun.
[5492.80 → 5495.16] Uh, there's going to be videos on both of our channels.
[5495.26 → 5497.10] I'm not going to give away anything about them,
[5497.20 → 5498.18] but it's with Kitbag,
[5498.28 → 5500.52] so you can imagine that it's going to involve...
[5500.52 → 5501.72] Put one or two things together there.
[5501.74 → 5504.10] Yeah, scammers and computers and...
[5504.10 → 5504.90] Fantastic videos.
[5504.90 → 5507.36] Messing with scammers with computers, you know?
[5507.84 → 5508.92] Something along those lines.
[5509.32 → 5509.96] Yeah, no, dude.
[5511.30 → 5515.00] We, we had the entire production team,
[5515.66 → 5516.92] including ourselves,
[5517.12 → 5518.68] because fortunately, like, there's no video, right?
[5518.70 → 5520.12] So we don't even have to keep a straight face.
[5520.18 → 5521.96] We had the entire, the entire room,
[5522.22 → 5523.42] just like in stitches,
[5523.62 → 5525.92] multiple times to the point where we had to, like,
[5525.98 → 5526.86] mute our microphones,
[5526.86 → 5531.82] because it was just like some of the outlandish stuff that happens.
[5531.82 → 5532.46] It's going to be great.
[5533.18 → 5533.50] Um.
[5533.50 → 5534.16] Oh, that's good.
[5534.44 → 5537.12] And then I've got another collab upcoming
[5537.12 → 5539.50] where we're going to be working with Badminton Insight,
[5539.62 → 5540.88] so they're a big badminton channel.
[5541.20 → 5542.66] Uh, big, big week for collabs.
[5542.82 → 5543.58] Big week for collabs.
[5543.72 → 5544.10] It's awesome.
[5545.86 → 5547.54] Oh, what, what, what, what, what, what,
[5547.54 → 5548.86] what are we supposed to be talking about?
[5548.96 → 5549.72] What are we supposed to be talking about?
[5550.62 → 5551.02] Um.
[5551.74 → 5552.18] Microsoft.
[5553.10 → 5556.36] Publicly rolling out recall to consumer copilot plus PCs.
[5556.88 → 5557.16] Again.
[5557.56 → 5560.32] Along with improved Windows search and click to do.
[5560.32 → 5562.62] Microsoft is launching recall,
[5562.76 → 5563.96] no, really, for real this time,
[5564.30 → 5567.26] uh, via a Windows update to all copilot plus PCs.
[5567.50 → 5569.52] It is available now via the April 2025
[5569.52 → 5571.74] Windows non-security preview update.
[5572.04 → 5573.84] It's being accompanied by an improved
[5573.84 → 5575.36] AI-powered Windows search interface,
[5575.48 → 5577.26] because that's what the Windows search interface needed,
[5577.58 → 5578.88] and a new click to do feature,
[5579.02 → 5581.62] which is similar to Google's Circle to Search.
[5582.58 → 5584.30] Uh, recall was originally supposed to launch
[5584.30 → 5585.36] in June of last year,
[5585.40 → 5587.10] but was delayed following concerns
[5587.10 → 5588.64] brought up by security researchers,
[5588.92 → 5590.14] and there were many.
[5590.32 → 5591.80] They have spent 10 months
[5591.80 → 5593.64] overhauling some of the security of recall,
[5593.92 → 5595.96] part of which is making it an opt-in experience.
[5596.06 → 5596.62] Okay, that's good.
[5596.74 → 5597.66] That's actually very good.
[5598.24 → 5600.02] The database is also now encrypted,
[5600.38 → 5602.92] and attempts to filter sensitive data by default.
[5603.76 → 5604.64] Uh, I thought that was,
[5604.74 → 5605.70] it was supposed to do that.
[5605.76 → 5606.66] Maybe it's just better at it?
[5607.18 → 5609.00] None of these improvements help third parties
[5609.00 → 5610.24] who may be communicating with someone
[5610.24 → 5611.42] who has recall enabled,
[5611.60 → 5613.88] such as via chat, email, etc., however.
[5614.82 → 5615.50] Alongside recall,
[5615.70 → 5616.70] you can now use Windows search
[5616.70 → 5617.90] with natural language queries.
[5617.90 → 5619.92] So if you're looking for an image of a brown dog,
[5619.98 → 5621.04] but can't remember the file name,
[5621.08 → 5622.54] you can just ask for brown dog,
[5622.64 → 5624.32] and then it will bring up a web search
[5624.32 → 5625.50] for brown dog, I suppose.
[5625.92 → 5627.12] Click to do is also available,
[5627.20 → 5628.26] letting you highlight text or images
[5628.26 → 5629.60] and have AI interact with them.
[5629.70 → 5630.64] The description makes this sound
[5630.64 → 5632.34] almost like AI-powered right-click, right?
[5633.02 → 5633.56] Oh, God.
[5633.68 → 5634.30] Demo available?
[5634.76 → 5635.64] Use the laptop.
[5635.90 → 5637.58] Recall is pinned to the taskbar.
[5637.76 → 5639.06] Silver on the corner there for you.
[5639.48 → 5640.12] Oh, no.
[5640.78 → 5642.08] Uh, that's the other side of your laptop.
[5642.08 → 5644.02] Is it this?
[5644.40 → 5644.66] Yes.
[5645.66 → 5646.10] Ah.
[5648.00 → 5648.82] Oh, Lord.
[5649.86 → 5650.30] All right.
[5650.86 → 5652.06] Well, hold on a second.
[5652.26 → 5654.96] Our laptop partner for the show, Dell,
[5655.40 → 5657.44] probably doesn't want me to show you guys
[5657.44 → 5659.98] what this other laptop is.
[5660.32 → 5661.02] Do you want to get some tape?
[5661.16 → 5662.08] No, I'm just gonna...
[5662.68 → 5663.08] I'm just gonna...
[5663.08 → 5663.66] Wow.
[5663.66 → 5664.00] Wow.
[5665.00 → 5665.48] Whoa.
[5666.96 → 5668.36] That was smooth.
[5668.58 → 5668.92] Okay.
[5669.12 → 5669.62] There we go.
[5669.62 → 5670.70] Dang.
[5672.54 → 5673.92] His name's Dan, actually.
[5674.58 → 5675.20] Oh, my goodness.
[5680.20 → 5680.86] What's going on?
[5680.92 → 5681.38] I can do that.
[5681.40 → 5682.16] Trying to get the HDMI.
[5684.52 → 5685.38] You can do that?
[5685.42 → 5685.70] Yeah, right.
[5685.72 → 5686.88] You can't even lift two and a half pounds.
[5687.18 → 5688.00] Oh, my.
[5689.24 → 5689.58] Sorry.
[5689.68 → 5690.66] That's a bit of an inside joke.
[5691.20 → 5692.54] Have you even ordered them yet?
[5693.42 → 5693.78] Yes.
[5694.68 → 5695.86] Doesn't seem like it.
[5696.38 → 5698.54] It's not exactly like they're out of stock out there.
[5699.62 → 5701.38] Oh, my God.
[5705.38 → 5705.66] Yeah.
[5706.24 → 5706.68] Okay.
[5709.74 → 5710.82] Sign in options.
[5711.52 → 5712.12] But...
[5712.12 → 5712.68] Okay.
[5713.96 → 5715.38] I don't have it yet.
[5715.92 → 5716.22] Okay.
[5716.72 → 5717.48] You don't have a what?
[5717.82 → 5718.40] The laptop.
[5718.96 → 5719.84] You don't have the laptop?
[5720.06 → 5720.44] Not yet.
[5720.76 → 5721.40] You mean you don't have it?
[5721.44 → 5721.96] Of course you don't have it.
[5721.96 → 5722.34] I have it.
[5723.34 → 5724.18] No, the...
[5724.18 → 5724.64] The...
[5724.64 → 5725.14] The...
[5725.14 → 5725.80] The...
[5725.80 → 5726.68] Screen part.
[5727.60 → 5728.84] That goes on my screen.
[5729.02 → 5729.46] Wow, look.
[5729.50 → 5730.10] It's in stock.
[5730.20 → 5731.04] $7.50.
[5732.80 → 5733.72] Sounds like a bit much.
[5733.78 → 5734.54] Can't you just use like...
[5734.54 → 5736.12] Yeah, why can't you just lift a heavier weight?
[5736.30 → 5736.46] Right.
[5736.72 → 5739.32] Just put like a rotisserie chicken on each side or something.
[5739.64 → 5740.10] I...
[5740.10 → 5740.92] I can't lift...
[5740.92 → 5741.40] I have to...
[5741.40 → 5742.32] I have to grab those.
[5742.48 → 5743.14] I can't lift it.
[5743.70 → 5744.14] Gotta eat them.
[5746.10 → 5747.62] Grab them by the rotisserie chicken?
[5747.62 → 5755.54] Okay, I set it to 1080p.
[5755.60 → 5756.02] Does that help?
[5756.66 → 5756.98] No.
[5757.40 → 5758.62] Maybe plug and unplug.
[5759.16 → 5759.92] Plug and unplug.
[5760.52 → 5760.86] Okay.
[5761.68 → 5762.28] I will try that.
[5762.40 → 5762.86] Did it do with a...
[5762.86 → 5763.76] Why don't you just buy a pair and bring them?
[5763.88 → 5764.90] It's so lame.
[5765.54 → 5766.20] Yeah, Luke.
[5767.18 → 5768.12] I told you I might literally do that.
[5768.12 → 5769.84] It's so lame to have free access to a gym.
[5769.90 → 5770.14] Nothing.
[5770.14 → 5772.14] And all you have to do is carry...
[5772.14 → 5773.14] It's not really...
[5773.14 → 5774.68] Two and a half pounds to the gym with you.
[5774.74 → 5775.50] I helped design it.
[5775.52 → 5777.08] It's five pounds because I need to bring two of them.
[5777.08 → 5777.72] It's a lot of weight.
[5781.88 → 5782.24] Sorry.
[5782.40 → 5782.84] What's that, Dan?
[5783.18 → 5783.66] Still nothing.
[5784.14 → 5784.70] Still nothing?
[5784.76 → 5785.34] Two photos on show protection.
[5785.78 → 5787.32] I don't know what to tell you, sir.
[5787.44 → 5788.08] This is...
[5788.08 → 5790.10] This is as God made it.
[5791.76 → 5793.54] It's definitely doing a thing.
[5793.60 → 5794.48] It's detecting, yeah.
[5794.64 → 5795.62] When I plug in the thing.
[5795.72 → 5798.32] So I think this may be an issue on your side, sir.
[5798.46 → 5798.72] Okay.
[5798.82 → 5799.26] Skill issue.
[5799.36 → 5799.70] One sec.
[5800.06 → 5800.40] Okay.
[5800.84 → 5802.82] I'm going to say show only on two.
[5803.40 → 5805.62] Now, theoretically, you are the only one with an output.
[5805.62 → 5807.10] My screen is black.
[5807.20 → 5808.38] Why did you do that?
[5808.80 → 5811.08] So that he can be the one who definitely has an output.
[5814.46 → 5815.64] I'm putting out for him.
[5816.04 → 5816.26] Oh.
[5818.98 → 5820.76] You're sending me 1080 by 1200.
[5820.98 → 5822.38] I can't deal with that.
[5822.84 → 5823.82] Let me try doing...
[5823.82 → 5824.10] No.
[5824.28 → 5826.12] Is it doing the stupid thing?
[5826.30 → 5827.08] Let me try doing it.
[5827.08 → 5827.28] No.
[5827.38 → 5829.22] I think it's doing the stupid thing.
[5829.60 → 5831.60] The active signal versus the...
[5831.60 → 5832.72] Oh, I hate that!
[5833.58 → 5835.54] I hate that so much!
[5836.66 → 5837.62] Just give me a sec.
[5837.62 → 5838.92] Can it just never...
[5838.92 → 5839.08] Okay.
[5840.56 → 5843.52] NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Microsoft.
[5843.78 → 5844.60] All four of you all.
[5845.60 → 5846.60] Get rid of that.
[5847.30 → 5848.56] Get rid of it completely.
[5848.56 → 5850.56] The whole active signal resolution...
[5850.56 → 5850.84] What is it for?
[5851.52 → 5854.48] Variable or desktop mode and then being different.
[5855.40 → 5857.16] If I change the resolution...
[5857.16 → 5858.56] Just let the panel do the scaling.
[5859.16 → 5860.68] Nobody else touch anything.
[5861.26 → 5862.42] Leave it...
[5862.42 → 5863.92] Oh, I hate that so much.
[5863.98 → 5864.76] Unplug and rep lug?
[5865.24 → 5865.60] Yes.
[5867.06 → 5868.64] Every single time...
[5868.64 → 5869.16] You really should have tested.
[5869.22 → 5871.48] This has ever been a thing.
[5871.68 → 5872.72] It has been a problem.
[5872.72 → 5876.14] And I cannot think of any problem that it solves.
[5876.88 → 5879.18] What problem does that solve?
[5879.52 → 5881.96] It sends the native resolution to the panel.
[5883.34 → 5886.50] What does that have to do with the external display?
[5887.52 → 5888.20] Nothing.
[5888.70 → 5889.44] Leave it alone.
[5889.88 → 5892.18] Send whatever resolution that I set.
[5892.46 → 5893.74] Don't do anything else.
[5895.14 → 5895.84] Obnoxious.
[5897.16 → 5898.96] Jonah, force it to 1080.
[5899.12 → 5902.22] I'm going to try, but every time I try and do this...
[5902.22 → 5903.72] It's a gigantic hassle.
[5903.90 → 5905.92] It's caused us so many problems in the past.
[5907.04 → 5909.26] And overriding it is like a pain in the butt.
[5909.36 → 5912.72] No, I can't do anything with the NVIDIA app because it uses AMD.
[5913.22 → 5914.88] So there is no NVIDIA app.
[5915.50 → 5917.56] And I can't remember...
[5917.56 → 5919.94] It's more display modes.
[5920.18 → 5921.42] Do you want me to come and fumble with it?
[5921.70 → 5922.68] More display modes?
[5922.94 → 5923.46] Sorry, where's that?
[5923.46 → 5924.42] Oh, it's Windows 11.
[5924.48 → 5924.96] I can't remember.
[5925.82 → 5926.18] Brilliant.
[5926.36 → 5927.78] It should be under advanced display.
[5928.86 → 5930.08] And then...
[5930.08 → 5931.46] Wait, I'm using a computer.
[5931.46 → 5932.40] Or I can just check here.
[5933.04 → 5934.08] Advanced display.
[5934.46 → 5935.44] Display settings.
[5935.94 → 5936.40] Uh-huh.
[5936.68 → 5936.92] Advanced display.
[5936.92 → 5937.96] Display adapter properties.
[5938.42 → 5939.84] Seems like you guys need some tech tips.
[5940.38 → 5940.98] List all modes?
[5941.22 → 5942.08] Yeah, that's the one.
[5942.28 → 5944.08] I swear to God I've done this.
[5944.16 → 5946.36] No, I am in 1920 by 1080.
[5946.60 → 5947.26] 60 hertz.
[5948.16 → 5949.08] Yeah, I'm still getting 1200.
[5949.62 → 5950.14] I know.
[5950.36 → 5951.54] For the black magic?
[5951.54 → 5954.30] It's this stupid, obnoxious thing.
[5955.20 → 5961.00] No, I think there's something in AMD's software where you have to do something.
[5961.42 → 5962.78] Can you just set all of it to 1080?
[5963.80 → 5965.64] No, I am set to 1080.
[5966.34 → 5968.42] On both displays, I mean.
[5969.10 → 5971.06] They are both set to 1080, Dan.
[5971.16 → 5972.04] Oh, good God.
[5972.04 → 5973.66] I swear.
[5973.66 → 5974.84] They're both set to 1080.
[5975.04 → 5975.48] Oh!
[5977.36 → 5978.14] I have...
[5978.14 → 5979.82] I can't change it.
[5980.04 → 5984.62] I think, like, custom resolution utility or something.
[5984.88 → 5986.66] Like, this is, like...
[5986.66 → 5988.84] This is one of those things that makes me...
[5988.84 → 5989.42] Change scaling mode?
[5989.48 → 5989.84] I don't know.
[5989.94 → 5990.50] Really, Matt.
[5990.54 → 5991.54] No, scaling won't do it.
[5991.78 → 5992.88] We're running out of time here.
[5993.08 → 5995.86] Yeah, I think we might just have to give up on this.
[5995.98 → 5996.74] Here, give me the laptop.
[5996.74 → 5998.36] I can give you the laptop.
[5998.60 → 6000.82] I really don't think it's going to do anything, though.
[6002.16 → 6004.34] This has been such a good segment.
[6005.76 → 6006.88] Yeah, great job, everyone.
[6007.28 → 6009.44] Maybe I'll just do another topic.
[6009.72 → 6011.36] Yeah, maybe just get a Dell next time.
[6011.40 → 6013.84] Because when I plug into my Dell, it's just flippin' works.
[6016.56 → 6018.02] It's a pretty good advertisement.
[6018.18 → 6018.84] Just an idea.
[6018.98 → 6019.62] Money, please!
[6020.60 → 6021.36] What is that?
[6022.76 → 6024.28] Because we did a...
[6024.28 → 6027.06] It was technically a call-out for someone who's technically a sponsor.
[6028.46 → 6034.76] Anyway, Discord CEO Jason Citric steps down to be replaced by former president of King,
[6035.24 → 6039.78] also known as, like, the guys who made Candy Crush, ahead of potential IPO.
[6040.36 → 6043.72] On April 23rd, Discord CEO and co-founder, the person I just mentioned,
[6043.88 → 6049.02] uploaded a post to Discord's blog entitled Passing the Torch.
[6049.32 → 6052.40] Citric goes on to share that they have hired a new CEO.
[6052.40 → 6055.30] Human Making.
[6056.26 → 6057.78] That's a pretty sick first name.
[6058.16 → 6060.28] Definitely not an AI with a name like that.
[6060.34 → 6060.54] Yeah.
[6061.02 → 6065.40] And that Citric will be stepping down to a board and advisory position within Discord.
[6066.04 → 6069.26] Making's previous roles include vice chairman at Activision Blizzard,
[6069.82 → 6074.10] as well as president of King Digital Entertainment, makers of Candy Crush.
[6074.10 → 6080.48] Discord's other co-founder, Stanislav Vyshnevsky...
[6080.48 → 6081.22] Vyshnevsky.
[6081.46 → 6085.74] Vyshnevsky, almost, is continuing his role as chief technology officer.
[6086.26 → 6090.42] This change comes amid media reports that Discord met with investment bankers
[6090.42 → 6095.24] to discuss a possible initial public offering as soon as this year.
[6095.60 → 6100.46] A Discord spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it does, in quotes,
[6100.46 → 6103.52] not comment on rumours or speculation, and that it is focused on...
[6103.52 → 6107.00] I feel like Discord has commented on a lot of rumours and speculation over the years, but sure.
[6107.82 → 6108.28] Yeah.
[6108.88 → 6112.24] And that it is focused on delivering the best possible experience to our users
[6112.24 → 6113.70] and building a strong, sustainable business.
[6114.04 → 6116.56] To me, honestly, that is just like, yes, we're doing it!
[6116.56 → 6124.84] But, anyway, Discord currently has 200 million global monthly active users
[6124.84 → 6131.90] playing a combined 1.5 billion hours of games each month while on the platform.
[6132.08 → 6133.10] Alright, discussion question.
[6133.24 → 6134.48] What are we going to switch to from Discord?
[6135.62 → 6136.74] There's really...
[6136.74 → 6139.18] It will almost certainly in s***if.
[6139.74 → 6141.10] I still use TeamSpeak every once in a while.
[6142.18 → 6142.80] Mumble, anyone?
[6144.10 → 6144.94] We could go back.
[6144.94 → 6147.50] The old guards are largely still there.
[6148.14 → 6149.78] Which is kind of weird, actually.
[6149.96 → 6150.80] Like, Mumble still exists?
[6151.58 → 6152.78] I'm pretty sure Mumble still exists.
[6152.92 → 6154.08] I think Ventral still exists.
[6154.34 → 6155.58] I know TeamSpeak still exists.
[6155.66 → 6156.78] Mumble totally still exists.
[6156.94 → 6157.18] Yeah.
[6157.46 → 6159.64] Dude, when did they get...
[6159.64 → 6160.86] When was the last version?
[6162.80 → 6163.60] Stable version.
[6164.00 → 6164.54] Show me a date.
[6164.74 → 6165.62] Show me a date on this.
[6165.86 → 6166.58] Okay, here we go.
[6167.68 → 6168.80] Dude, December 8th, 2024.
[6169.00 → 6169.82] That wasn't even that long ago.
[6169.94 → 6170.90] Yeah, vent, look.
[6171.38 → 6173.56] 45 commits since this release!
[6173.56 → 6175.24] Dude!
[6175.44 → 6175.90] Look, look, look.
[6178.22 → 6180.14] Ventral is totally still a thing.
[6180.74 → 6182.34] That Windows logo, though.
[6182.46 → 6183.36] Good lord.
[6183.58 → 6184.58] That is incredible.
[6185.00 → 6185.70] TeamSpeak's still around.
[6185.82 → 6187.26] Look, they have an Among Us meme.
[6188.78 → 6189.66] They're still around.
[6190.40 → 6191.80] How timely and relevant.
[6192.16 → 6192.34] Yeah.
[6192.58 → 6194.56] TeamSpeak's Twitter just memes about how, like...
[6194.56 → 6199.16] Discord will go down for a second, and they'll be like,
[6199.22 → 6199.58] Finally!
[6199.90 → 6200.18] Users!
[6201.32 → 6205.38] So they're like making self-owned jokes and stuff.
[6206.40 → 6208.32] But yeah, there's still a thing.
[6208.66 → 6209.44] What would...
[6209.44 → 6210.68] What would...
[6210.68 → 6214.44] What in ratification would it take for you to stop using Discord?
[6215.50 → 6217.30] People would need to leave it.
[6218.12 → 6222.26] I feel next to no alignment at all with Discord.
[6222.46 → 6224.76] I would be happy to switch to TeamSpeak tomorrow.
[6227.04 → 6230.92] Would you consider switching to just Steam?
[6231.06 → 6232.62] Like, Steam has...
[6232.62 → 6235.10] One of the big reasons that everyone got off of Steam,
[6235.10 → 6236.50] because everyone used it.
[6237.36 → 6237.70] One of the...
[6237.70 → 6238.06] The voice sucks.
[6238.06 → 6239.48] As their, like, gaming social network.
[6239.94 → 6241.70] Okay, I haven't tried it because...
[6241.70 → 6242.26] It sucked.
[6242.38 → 6243.44] I don't know if it still does.
[6243.46 → 6243.68] Right.
[6243.98 → 6246.50] So they didn't have it, and then it sucked.
[6247.18 → 6248.50] Would we just go back to Steam?
[6251.28 → 6253.04] Apparently Steam Voice is perfect now,
[6253.10 → 6254.90] and then the next person who replied said,
[6255.08 → 6256.42] It's kind of trash, so...
[6256.42 → 6258.08] I wonder when the last time they used it, though,
[6258.10 → 6259.28] if they think that it's trash.
[6260.76 → 6262.32] Well, like, Discord is more than just games?
[6262.32 → 6262.64] Yeah.
[6262.86 → 6264.96] I mean, we use Discord just to, like,
[6265.10 → 6266.66] chat about things that are not just games.
[6266.66 → 6268.26] Steam is also more than just games.
[6269.68 → 6270.82] Steam's mobile app.
[6272.18 → 6273.10] Not amazing.
[6273.30 → 6273.96] Not amazing.
[6275.34 → 6277.94] That's definitely an advantage for Discord.
[6278.08 → 6279.92] Not that I ever get a notification when you message me,
[6280.00 → 6280.60] but sure, whatever.
[6281.08 → 6283.48] I got a notification that you messaged me,
[6283.54 → 6284.80] I think, yesterday, this morning.
[6284.96 → 6285.22] Cool.
[6285.64 → 6286.70] I was like...
[6286.70 → 6287.22] Yeah, I was like,
[6287.26 → 6288.24] Wow, he's ignoring me.
[6288.30 → 6288.86] I'm unfriended.
[6290.14 → 6292.78] Turns out Discord unfriended me.
[6295.10 → 6299.48] I can't see my podcast moving their communities into Steam.
[6300.68 → 6301.62] Yeah, sure.
[6301.76 → 6302.10] I don't know.
[6302.30 → 6302.74] It's...
[6302.74 → 6305.70] But, I mean, Discord had that same...
[6305.70 → 6306.00] There are other solutions.
[6306.40 → 6306.56] Yeah, they did.
[6306.56 → 6307.96] Discord had that same perception.
[6309.06 → 6311.50] Like, if you have a good product,
[6311.66 → 6312.12] people might...
[6312.12 → 6313.78] I mean, people used Skype for gaming,
[6313.88 → 6314.54] for crying out loud.
[6314.72 → 6317.30] Skype did not have a gaming brand back then.
[6317.30 → 6319.82] I think people will use a good product
[6319.82 → 6321.28] for whatever it's good for,
[6321.40 → 6322.98] regardless of the branding.
[6323.58 → 6325.58] Modern TeamSpeak also has, like,
[6325.68 → 6329.04] the chat and picture and stuff sharing features
[6329.04 → 6330.26] that Discord has.
[6331.16 → 6332.88] Does it do the streaming thing that Discord does,
[6332.94 → 6335.26] where you can, like, screen stream and stuff?
[6335.58 → 6337.90] I don't know on that.
[6339.08 → 6341.40] No, we're not using Yahoo chat waffle with syrup.
[6341.40 → 6347.50] Yeah, I'm not sure on the screen sharing thing.
[6347.74 → 6349.50] And Discord's pushing that hard.
[6349.84 → 6350.72] I don't know why.
[6351.96 → 6353.46] I haven't really been able to figure that out.
[6354.76 → 6357.40] Um, maybe they are...
[6357.40 → 6358.52] Maybe...
[6358.52 → 6359.88] Yeah, what would they be doing with that?
[6360.40 → 6362.38] In TeamSpeak communities, you can stream,
[6362.70 → 6364.52] but you have to pay for them,
[6364.58 → 6365.40] and server files...
[6366.40 → 6368.34] Server files aren't public yet?
[6368.34 → 6370.40] You mean server files to, like,
[6370.50 → 6372.16] self-host the streaming stuff?
[6372.30 → 6372.80] Is that what you're saying?
[6373.44 → 6374.66] I'm not sure what that person means.
[6375.30 → 6375.48] Cool.
[6375.72 → 6377.94] On my self-hosted server, I cannot screen share.
[6378.02 → 6378.40] Okay, yeah.
[6378.48 → 6380.50] So self-hosted you can't, but theirs you can,
[6380.58 → 6381.34] which...
[6381.92 → 6382.82] Uh, okay.
[6382.92 → 6383.52] Kind of makes sense.
[6384.60 → 6385.12] So, yeah.
[6385.20 → 6386.96] What would it take, basically?
[6387.14 → 6388.24] Well, what do you think it would take
[6388.24 → 6390.02] for any of your, like, gaming buddies
[6390.02 → 6390.92] to get off of Discord?
[6392.12 → 6393.82] Like a major privacy incident,
[6394.70 → 6396.82] or like a data collection change
[6396.82 → 6398.50] in the terms of service,
[6398.82 → 6401.24] or just generally it's getting
[6401.24 → 6402.48] a little less reliable?
[6402.78 → 6403.78] Like, what is the...
[6403.78 → 6404.86] What's the n-shittification
[6404.86 → 6408.20] that would drive people off of Discord
[6408.20 → 6412.68] if they go IPO and just kind of suck now?
[6412.98 → 6413.64] Because, like, Reddit,
[6413.78 → 6414.74] it doesn't seem to have mattered.
[6414.84 → 6415.46] They went IPO,
[6415.78 → 6416.92] they antagonized their users,
[6417.06 → 6417.98] everybody's still on Reddit.
[6418.12 → 6420.88] People seem to have completely forgotten
[6420.88 → 6421.72] that they were mad.
[6421.88 → 6423.20] Yeah, people don't switch platforms anymore.
[6423.20 → 6423.32] Reddit.
[6424.20 → 6427.38] Um, like, it's a weird thing.
[6427.46 → 6429.62] I mean, we talked about this with...
[6429.62 → 6430.64] We've talked about this a few times
[6430.64 → 6431.10] on WAN Show.
[6431.32 → 6432.26] How, like, YouTube, Reddit,
[6432.36 → 6432.78] all these things,
[6432.82 → 6434.90] they feel extremely rooted now.
[6435.40 → 6436.56] Like, this is how...
[6436.56 → 6437.34] The internet has, like,
[6437.40 → 6438.34] figured itself out.
[6438.48 → 6440.00] These are the sites that just will stay
[6440.00 → 6440.76] for whatever reason.
[6441.56 → 6443.28] We used to go through social media platforms
[6443.28 → 6444.20] every couple years,
[6444.20 → 6446.80] and now things just stay.
[6447.02 → 6448.80] No matter how bad they are,
[6448.88 → 6450.74] it seems like they just stick around.
[6450.74 → 6452.32] Yeah, people just don't switch
[6452.32 → 6453.32] because we seem to have, like,
[6453.38 → 6454.42] critical mass or something.
[6454.48 → 6454.92] I'm not sure.
[6455.06 → 6456.64] So, I think a big part of the problem
[6456.64 → 6458.72] would be switching everyone,
[6459.02 → 6460.74] and I don't think a privacy incident,
[6461.52 → 6462.94] almost no matter how big,
[6463.10 → 6464.32] is going to switch everyone
[6464.32 → 6466.76] because as much as people scream about it,
[6466.96 → 6468.28] I think most people, unfortunately,
[6468.42 → 6469.08] just don't care.
[6470.42 → 6471.44] Okay, well...
[6471.44 → 6472.40] I think the audio quality
[6472.40 → 6473.58] on TeamSpeak is fantastic.
[6474.50 → 6478.08] Um, I think there are other things
[6478.08 → 6479.08] about it that are great.
[6479.08 → 6486.08] But it, like...
[6487.70 → 6488.72] Switch 2 pre-orders
[6488.72 → 6490.28] have been kind of a nightmare,
[6490.52 → 6492.00] and scalpers are trying to cash in.
[6492.48 → 6493.88] After a delay to assess
[6493.88 → 6495.08] the changing market conditions,
[6496.24 → 6496.80] tariffs,
[6497.30 → 6498.92] Nintendo opened up
[6498.92 → 6499.96] the North American pre-orders
[6499.96 → 6501.08] for the Switch 2 on April 24th,
[6501.64 → 6504.30] and it was very hard to secure one.
[6504.68 → 6507.52] There are a ton of eBay resellers
[6507.52 → 6509.94] who are selling their secured pre-orders
[6509.94 → 6512.44] like the buttheads that they are.
[6512.62 → 6513.62] Please report them.
[6514.10 → 6514.82] In Japan,
[6514.96 → 6516.62] where they're offering a discounted
[6516.62 → 6518.46] Japanese-only version of the console
[6518.46 → 6520.04] for about $350 US,
[6520.72 → 6524.92] over 2.2 million people
[6524.92 → 6526.36] entered the lottery
[6526.36 → 6529.18] for the privilege of giving their money
[6529.18 → 6530.18] to Nintendo.
[6530.18 → 6532.60] So, if you were questioning
[6532.60 → 6534.38] whether the Switch 2
[6534.38 → 6535.74] will be a success
[6535.74 → 6537.18] as a gaming platform,
[6537.34 → 6539.02] I think you can probably
[6539.02 → 6541.02] put that wonder to rest
[6541.02 → 6541.96] at this point.
[6542.78 → 6543.94] Yes, it is more expensive
[6543.94 → 6544.74] than the Switch 1.
[6545.20 → 6547.34] No, that does not appear to matter.
[6547.78 → 6549.18] I'm not surprised at all.
[6550.40 → 6551.08] Not even a little bit.
[6551.56 → 6553.12] That's pretty wild to me.
[6553.18 → 6554.84] Those are just monstrous numbers.
[6555.18 → 6555.74] Like...
[6555.74 → 6556.82] Oh, the numbers are...
[6556.82 → 6557.62] Yeah, those are crazy.
[6557.86 → 6557.94] Wow.
[6557.94 → 6559.20] What I mean is I'm not surprised
[6559.20 → 6560.58] that scalpers are an issue
[6560.58 → 6561.66] and everybody's going for it.
[6562.02 → 6563.12] That works for me.
[6564.24 → 6564.86] I don't know.
[6564.94 → 6566.48] I kind of believed in Nintendo
[6566.48 → 6567.38] that they were just going to
[6567.38 → 6568.24] make enough of them.
[6568.60 → 6569.54] And I guess you just like...
[6569.54 → 6570.96] You can't make enough
[6570.96 → 6572.06] when you have eight years
[6572.06 → 6572.86] of pent-up demand
[6572.86 → 6575.02] for a Nintendo console
[6575.02 → 6576.38] that doesn't look like
[6576.38 → 6577.44] donkey balls on your TV.
[6582.88 → 6585.20] I mean, the Switch was an old phone
[6585.20 → 6586.20] when they launched it.
[6586.20 → 6587.04] Donkey Kong balls.
[6587.04 → 6588.58] Super hairy.
[6589.34 → 6589.84] Big.
[6590.80 → 6591.90] He likes bananas.
[6592.12 → 6593.08] Bongo-tactic.
[6594.12 → 6595.26] Bongo balls.
[6599.62 → 6601.46] The European Commission
[6601.46 → 6604.02] continues to be a beacon of hope.
[6604.68 → 6605.46] The European Commission
[6605.46 → 6607.56] fined Apple 500 million euro
[6607.56 → 6609.34] for blocking app developers
[6609.34 → 6610.78] from steering users
[6610.78 → 6612.70] to cheaper payment options
[6612.70 → 6613.54] outside the app store.
[6613.54 → 6615.56] Meta also got hit
[6615.56 → 6617.30] with a 200 million euro fine
[6617.30 → 6619.22] for its consent or pay model
[6619.22 → 6620.62] which forces users
[6620.62 → 6622.36] to either give up their data
[6622.36 → 6624.70] or pay for ad-free versions
[6624.70 → 6626.06] of Facebook and Instagram.
[6626.72 → 6627.92] Honestly, I was kind of okay
[6627.92 → 6628.96] with Facebook's approach.
[6629.04 → 6629.82] I was totally fine with it,
[6629.88 → 6630.18] to be honest.
[6630.24 → 6631.32] Just don't use the service.
[6631.32 → 6633.68] However, Facebook Marketplace
[6633.68 → 6635.40] dodged major regulation
[6635.40 → 6636.12] under the DMA
[6636.12 → 6637.08] after the EU found
[6637.08 → 6637.86] that it had fewer
[6637.86 → 6639.54] than 10,000 business users
[6639.54 → 6641.06] so it is no longer
[6641.06 → 6642.34] designated under the DMA.
[6642.54 → 6643.64] The note here says,
[6644.04 → 6645.26] Linus isn't convinced
[6645.26 → 6647.28] by that 10,000 business user number.
[6647.74 → 6648.70] Expand on that thought
[6648.70 → 6649.30] for the class.
[6649.36 → 6650.10] I'd be happy to.
[6651.04 → 6652.60] Simply based on the number
[6652.60 → 6653.62] of commercial entities
[6653.62 → 6655.24] that I see selling stuff
[6655.24 → 6656.60] on Facebook Marketplace here,
[6656.60 → 6657.78] whether it's cars
[6657.78 → 6659.06] or services
[6659.06 → 6660.30] or whatever else
[6660.30 → 6662.04] across the entire EU.
[6662.16 → 6662.68] You're going to tell me
[6662.68 → 6663.78] there's less than 10,000 of them?
[6663.96 → 6665.68] I do not believe you.
[6665.78 → 6666.26] I think that's
[6666.26 → 6667.82] dramatically underreported.
[6668.48 → 6670.22] On a more consumer-friendly note,
[6670.40 → 6671.42] starting June the 20th,
[6671.62 → 6672.78] all smartphones and tablets
[6672.78 → 6673.44] sold in the EU
[6673.44 → 6674.38] must come with a label
[6674.38 → 6675.50] showing battery life,
[6676.08 → 6676.84] energy efficiency,
[6677.34 → 6679.96] and repairability ratings.
[6680.80 → 6682.06] How cool is that?
[6682.16 → 6682.46] Does that mean
[6682.46 → 6683.60] there's going to be a standard
[6683.60 → 6685.44] for evaluating these things?
[6685.44 → 6687.44] Is there a standard for...
[6689.30 → 6690.92] A, B, C, D, E,
[6691.16 → 6692.68] for repairability class.
[6693.14 → 6693.44] Yeah, yeah,
[6693.46 → 6694.22] that's not what I mean.
[6694.56 → 6695.00] A standard?
[6695.16 → 6695.74] I don't know.
[6695.84 → 6697.08] How do they rate them?
[6697.16 → 6697.58] I don't know.
[6697.66 → 6698.44] Who's rating them?
[6698.46 → 6698.82] I don't know.
[6698.86 → 6699.24] Someone is.
[6699.32 → 6700.44] How do you rate repairability
[6701.20 → 6701.56] on a scale?
[6701.56 → 6701.76] I don't know.
[6701.76 → 6702.48] Fix it, does it?
[6702.86 → 6703.54] Yeah, but that's
[6703.54 → 6704.58] one individual company.
[6704.70 → 6705.82] Well, I'm just saying,
[6705.94 → 6706.64] EU repair...
[6706.64 → 6708.74] I'm sure there's a rubric.
[6710.06 → 6710.24] There.
[6710.86 → 6711.94] EU repairability.
[6711.94 → 6712.50] What's the rubric
[6712.50 → 6713.36] for battery life?
[6713.44 → 6714.02] What's the test
[6714.02 → 6714.94] they're doing for battery life?
[6714.94 → 6715.78] Repairability Index.
[6715.88 → 6716.46] Calm down.
[6716.58 → 6717.12] I'm not saying
[6717.12 → 6717.68] it doesn't exist.
[6717.80 → 6719.02] I'm saying I want to see it.
[6719.02 → 6719.66] I'll fight you.
[6719.94 → 6721.00] What are we fighting about?
[6723.06 → 6724.22] Repairability scoring system.
[6724.34 → 6724.94] Product Bureau.
[6725.84 → 6726.88] Europa.eu.
[6728.06 → 6728.42] Repair.
[6728.58 → 6729.20] Okay, here we go.
[6729.30 → 6730.06] Including scoring.
[6730.20 → 6730.72] Here, are you happy?
[6731.02 → 6731.52] Okay, cool.
[6731.64 → 6731.88] Jeez.
[6731.94 → 6732.62] How did they do it, though?
[6732.86 → 6734.14] Welcome to the website
[6734.14 → 6735.58] about product repairability.
[6735.98 → 6736.80] Wow, that is like
[6736.80 → 6738.38] the most European header
[6738.38 → 6739.34] that I think I've ever...
[6739.34 → 6740.26] Okay, project plan.
[6740.82 → 6741.62] Project plan.
[6741.96 → 6742.58] Oh, my God.
[6742.58 → 6744.14] Documents.
[6744.54 → 6745.96] Where's scoring then?
[6746.18 → 6746.96] Related links.
[6747.12 → 6747.42] Ugh.
[6748.36 → 6749.20] Oh, boy.
[6749.98 → 6751.14] I'd be really interested
[6751.14 → 6753.58] to see how they score
[6753.58 → 6754.82] across so many different devices,
[6754.96 → 6756.20] repairability and battery life.
[6756.20 → 6757.42] Here's a second draft report,
[6757.54 → 6758.16] okay, smart guy?
[6758.36 → 6758.88] Oh, boy.
[6759.10 → 6759.60] Oh, boy.
[6759.84 → 6760.68] Oh, boy.
[6760.74 → 6761.40] How long is this?
[6762.36 → 6764.02] We need an AI summary stat.
[6764.20 → 6764.66] Oh, whoa, whoa.
[6764.66 → 6765.40] Hold on, hold on.
[6765.46 → 6765.76] We got...
[6765.76 → 6765.98] No, no.
[6766.00 → 6766.56] We got the thing.
[6766.62 → 6767.10] We got the thing.
[6767.56 → 6768.84] We got the index.
[6769.00 → 6770.54] The table of indexes.
[6772.80 → 6773.60] Disassembly depth.
[6774.36 → 6775.06] Fastener type.
[6775.70 → 6776.06] Tools.
[6776.78 → 6777.54] Spare parts.
[6777.62 → 6777.98] Cool.
[6778.28 → 6779.10] Software updates.
[6779.22 → 6779.96] Repair information.
[6779.96 → 6781.02] Other relevant parameters.
[6781.36 → 6782.50] Selection of scoring parameters.
[6783.14 → 6783.28] Okay.
[6783.28 → 6784.18] I'd be really interested
[6784.18 → 6784.96] to see how...
[6785.44 → 6786.32] Disassembly depth.
[6786.44 → 6787.20] Page 17.
[6787.90 → 6788.62] I'd be really interested
[6788.62 → 6790.20] to see how scaling...
[6790.84 → 6792.26] How this scale works
[6792.26 → 6793.32] versus the fixity scale.
[6793.60 → 6794.90] Okay, so disassembly depth.
[6794.96 → 6795.42] Here we go.
[6796.60 → 6797.72] Where is it?
[6797.80 → 6799.28] It said it was on page 17.
[6799.46 → 6800.00] Disassembly depth.
[6800.04 → 6800.36] Here we go.
[6800.68 → 6802.42] A score is assigned
[6802.42 → 6804.34] for each priority part
[6804.34 → 6806.28] based on their disassembly depths.
[6807.06 → 6808.68] A discrete rating is proposed.
[6808.68 → 6809.58] Points are assigned
[6809.58 → 6810.78] at priority part level.
[6810.98 → 6812.08] So rating class one.
[6813.60 → 6815.30] Disassembly depth index
[6815.30 → 6816.86] less than or equal to two steps
[6816.86 → 6817.74] is five points.
[6818.18 → 6820.12] If you are 15 steps
[6820.12 → 6821.20] of disassembly depth,
[6821.30 → 6822.24] that's one point.
[6822.44 → 6823.48] And that's a priority part.
[6823.56 → 6824.12] So a priority part,
[6824.18 → 6824.68] I'm assuming...
[6824.68 → 6825.60] Would be like a screen.
[6825.86 → 6826.88] Or a battery.
[6827.06 → 6828.20] Or a drive.
[6828.62 → 6829.18] Cool.
[6829.68 → 6830.26] I'm assuming.
[6830.82 → 6831.22] Okay.
[6832.26 → 6832.82] Sweet.
[6833.08 → 6834.22] I wonder how they do battery.
[6834.62 → 6835.90] But that is very cool.
[6837.98 → 6838.74] I mean,
[6838.84 → 6840.62] most batteries don't move around much,
[6840.68 → 6841.34] so I'd imagine they just...
[6843.34 → 6844.58] Do the battery, yo.
[6845.64 → 6846.44] Do the battery.
[6846.86 → 6848.16] And then you spontaneously combust.
[6850.16 → 6851.08] Someone pokes you
[6851.08 → 6851.84] and you just blow up.
[6853.54 → 6854.92] If you're a Samsung, yeah.
[6856.34 → 6856.90] Got him.
[6857.22 → 6857.80] Note 7.
[6857.92 → 6859.02] Note 7 zing.
[6859.18 → 6860.24] Wow, that's...
[6860.24 → 6861.24] timely.
[6862.04 → 6865.90] What are we supposed to be doing?
[6865.90 → 6867.38] You can give yourself a...
[6867.38 → 6868.62] You got about five minutes
[6868.62 → 6869.54] until when after dark?
[6870.06 → 6870.32] Oh.
[6870.52 → 6871.46] Oh yeah, you have an out.
[6871.46 → 6873.42] Oh yeah.
[6873.58 → 6874.56] I sort of forgot about that.
[6874.94 → 6875.16] Yep.
[6875.88 → 6876.96] The LTT Subreddit
[6876.96 → 6878.06] has corrected
[6878.06 → 6879.18] Linus' take on
[6879.18 → 6880.26] American cheese.
[6880.48 → 6881.42] He was wrong again.
[6881.58 → 6882.42] I think I was also wrong,
[6882.50 → 6883.38] but I'm going to point it at him
[6883.38 → 6884.52] because it says Linus' take.
[6885.26 → 6886.02] Uh...
[6886.02 → 6887.48] Not my fault this time.
[6887.54 → 6888.64] Didn't have my name in the subject.
[6888.64 → 6890.40] It is indeed made primarily
[6890.40 → 6891.56] from real cheese
[6891.56 → 6892.86] with some added ingredients
[6892.86 → 6894.04] to change its texture.
[6894.60 → 6895.40] The two linked threads
[6895.40 → 6896.20] point towards a video
[6896.20 → 6896.92] by Nile Red
[6896.92 → 6897.92] on his secondary channel
[6897.92 → 6898.46] Nile Blue
[6898.46 → 6899.60] making American cheese
[6899.60 → 6900.16] on his own.
[6900.94 → 6901.34] Uh...
[6901.34 → 6902.26] We're not going to watch that here.
[6902.32 → 6903.24] You guys should go watch it.
[6903.34 → 6903.52] Yeah.
[6903.94 → 6905.12] The discussion question is,
[6905.76 → 6906.90] is it cheese now?
[6907.58 → 6909.04] It doesn't taste like cheese.
[6909.04 → 6913.28] And maybe part of the problem
[6913.28 → 6913.50] is...
[6913.50 → 6914.34] What are the other ingredients?
[6914.54 → 6915.46] The particular brands,
[6915.54 → 6916.88] it's like salt and something
[6916.88 → 6918.22] or butter and milk powder,
[6918.60 → 6918.84] something.
[6919.02 → 6920.74] Normally there's an emulsifier as well,
[6920.84 → 6921.98] like a xanthan gum or something.
[6922.18 → 6922.40] Yeah.
[6923.00 → 6923.64] Um...
[6923.64 → 6924.50] You can make it yourself.
[6924.60 → 6925.84] There's a great Chef Steps video
[6925.84 → 6927.20] on making a...
[6927.20 → 6928.20] Yeah, it's...
[6928.20 → 6929.10] Chef Steps is great.
[6929.16 → 6930.20] The ones I've eaten
[6930.20 → 6931.14] are disgusting.
[6931.84 → 6932.76] So I'll say that much.
[6932.88 → 6934.80] Because it's mostly not cheese.
[6934.94 → 6936.16] Dude, It's Alive with Brad
[6936.16 → 6937.46] is actually amazing.
[6937.68 → 6938.70] Oh my God.
[6938.70 → 6939.10] Yeah.
[6939.76 → 6940.14] What's that?
[6940.26 → 6941.92] Oh, or Is It Alive with Brad?
[6942.04 → 6943.48] Is that Bon Appétit?
[6944.12 → 6944.70] Yeah, wait.
[6944.92 → 6946.00] I'm talking about the wrong one.
[6946.06 → 6947.76] But yes, I like both of them.
[6947.92 → 6948.48] Both of them are great.
[6949.20 → 6949.96] I got them conflated,
[6950.04 → 6950.92] but I do like both of them a lot.
[6950.94 → 6952.06] So it has cheese in it.
[6952.30 → 6953.00] And that's good.
[6953.82 → 6956.04] And I like my cheese in a brick.
[6959.64 → 6961.22] Chef Steps makes the Jewel, right?
[6962.12 → 6963.10] No, that's a...
[6963.10 → 6964.34] They make the ANOVA.
[6965.04 → 6965.44] Ah.
[6966.28 → 6967.58] Apparently it used to be Bon Appétit,
[6967.58 → 6968.22] but he went solo.
[6969.66 → 6970.08] Cool.
[6970.30 → 6970.72] Either way.
[6970.86 → 6971.26] Good stuff.
[6972.10 → 6972.96] Game Over There says,
[6973.04 → 6974.06] American cheese is good
[6974.06 → 6975.26] exclusively on sandwiches
[6975.26 → 6976.88] with really cheap-ass lunch meat.
[6977.92 → 6978.26] Ah.
[6979.10 → 6980.94] I mean, the menu has a line in it
[6980.94 → 6981.42] at the end
[6981.42 → 6982.18] that American cheese
[6982.18 → 6983.04] is the best cheese
[6983.04 → 6983.92] for putting on a burger
[6983.92 → 6985.20] because it doesn't split
[6985.20 → 6986.12] when it's heated
[6986.12 → 6987.06] to a high temperature.
[6987.34 → 6988.10] Doesn't split?
[6988.30 → 6989.76] That's what the emulsifiers are for.
[6989.92 → 6990.60] What do you mean by split?
[6990.68 → 6991.36] Why would it split?
[6991.36 → 6994.64] Um, well, the oils separate.
[6994.98 → 6995.88] Have you ever made, like,
[6996.12 → 6997.20] hollandaise or something like that?
[6997.30 → 6997.96] Yeah, it's great
[6997.96 → 6998.82] when the oils separate.
[6999.60 → 7001.20] You like it when it gets grainy
[7001.20 → 7001.74] and, like...
[7001.74 → 7002.24] Grainy?
[7002.72 → 7003.38] What are you even talking about?
[7003.38 → 7003.90] What kind of cheese
[7003.90 → 7004.58] are you people eating?
[7004.64 → 7005.64] This is normal cheese.
[7005.64 → 7007.12] If you overheat normal cheese.
[7007.46 → 7008.70] Well, why would you overheat it?
[7009.46 → 7009.88] Get good.
[7009.96 → 7011.42] Say you're making a cheese sauce
[7011.42 → 7012.62] or a grilled cheese.
[7012.62 → 7013.62] No, I thought we were talking
[7013.62 → 7014.14] about a burger.
[7015.30 → 7015.54] Yeah.
[7015.80 → 7016.68] You put it on a hot burger.
[7017.18 → 7018.22] Put it on a hot burger
[7018.22 → 7019.20] and then when it's melted,
[7019.32 → 7019.74] you eat it.
[7019.80 → 7020.66] What's wrong with you people?
[7022.58 → 7023.12] Someone says,
[7023.18 → 7024.20] Linus, you don't cook.
[7024.92 → 7025.88] No, but I can put...
[7025.88 → 7027.12] We're not talking about cooking.
[7027.12 → 7027.84] We're talking about
[7027.84 → 7028.84] putting cheese on a burger.
[7028.94 → 7029.64] That's not even...
[7029.64 → 7030.58] That's not even cooking.
[7030.68 → 7031.10] Who cares?
[7032.02 → 7033.04] Linus can't cook...
[7033.04 → 7035.42] What are you guys talking about?
[7036.98 → 7038.16] No, honestly, though.
[7038.76 → 7039.20] Okay.
[7040.40 → 7041.28] Both of you.
[7041.28 → 7044.26] I have handed both of you
[7044.26 → 7045.54] at some point or another
[7045.54 → 7046.96] a hamburger
[7046.96 → 7048.74] with melted cheese on it.
[7049.46 → 7050.90] Are you telling me
[7050.90 → 7053.58] that I prepared
[7053.58 → 7054.80] both of you?
[7055.38 → 7056.48] Explain this to me.
[7056.54 → 7056.96] I don't know if there's
[7056.96 → 7058.12] any evidence of this happening.
[7059.40 → 7060.62] You know for a fact
[7060.62 → 7062.00] more than one time.
[7062.96 → 7064.12] More than one time.
[7064.90 → 7066.82] I love how
[7066.82 → 7070.20] exclusively talking about
[7070.20 → 7071.26] cheese melting on hamburgers
[7071.28 → 7073.78] went to Linus can't cook.
[7074.20 → 7074.54] I...
[7074.54 → 7075.00] I...
[7075.00 → 7075.54] It's just...
[7075.54 → 7077.10] What is wrong with you people?
[7077.46 → 7078.46] There's...
[7078.46 → 7080.58] I'm just talking about
[7080.58 → 7082.24] emulsifiers in...
[7082.24 → 7084.28] in American cheese and...
[7084.28 → 7086.56] The conversation of which
[7086.56 → 7087.68] Linus was following.
[7087.90 → 7089.42] Yeah, but why do I need them?
[7090.12 → 7091.38] What's wrong with the...
[7091.38 → 7092.60] What's wrong with the
[7092.60 → 7093.38] melted cheese
[7093.38 → 7094.12] that's just...
[7094.12 → 7095.34] It doesn't have emulsifying
[7095.34 → 7096.06] agents in it?
[7096.06 → 7097.16] It just stabilizes it
[7097.16 → 7097.90] for temperatures.
[7097.90 → 7098.32] Who cares?
[7098.32 → 7099.86] If you're making a cheese sauce...
[7099.86 → 7101.24] But I'm not making a cheese sauce!
[7101.32 → 7102.60] I'm putting cheese on a burger!
[7102.82 → 7103.90] Then use whatever the hell
[7103.90 → 7104.50] you want!
[7105.16 → 7105.72] But what...
[7105.72 → 7107.44] What do the emulsifiers do?
[7107.52 → 7109.04] Someone said it doesn't do a thing!
[7110.32 → 7111.42] Cheddar doesn't have the same
[7111.42 → 7113.28] effect on hamburgers as American.
[7113.28 → 7114.28] What do you mean the same effect?
[7114.66 → 7116.16] It adds a cheesy flavour!
[7117.16 → 7117.66] What...
[7117.66 → 7118.08] What...
[7118.08 → 7119.12] What f***ING effect
[7119.12 → 7120.60] do you want from your cheese?
[7120.80 → 7121.92] It makes the burger
[7121.92 → 7123.54] taste less like plastic.
[7123.66 → 7124.72] You want it to tap dance?
[7126.62 → 7127.40] We're going to end up
[7127.40 → 7128.38] on the Subreddit again
[7128.38 → 7129.34] because of you, Linus.
[7130.14 → 7130.48] Good.
[7130.70 → 7131.52] Oh, man.
[7132.02 → 7133.60] Uh, cheese discourse.
[7133.84 → 7134.38] What are you guys
[7134.38 → 7135.30] even talking about?
[7139.30 → 7140.44] It's supposed to melt
[7140.44 → 7141.56] evenly like pizza.
[7141.72 → 7142.70] Unique username goes,
[7142.82 → 7143.28] you don't know
[7143.28 → 7144.10] s*** about cheese,
[7144.20 → 7145.06] just do the correction,
[7145.24 → 7145.80] you're going to be called
[7145.80 → 7147.06] a narcissist for weeks again.
[7147.06 → 7149.10] No, I'm asking a question!
[7149.34 → 7150.34] And no one's answering it.
[7150.52 → 7152.20] Nobody is answering the question!
[7152.42 → 7153.04] What is wrong
[7153.04 → 7153.98] with just melting
[7153.98 → 7154.96] regular cheese?
[7155.02 → 7155.88] And there is the line!
[7156.00 → 7156.40] Dan's right!
[7156.52 → 7156.74] Nothing.
[7156.74 → 7158.36] At the end of the menu,
[7158.76 → 7159.36] he talks about how
[7159.36 → 7160.18] American cheese is best
[7160.18 → 7160.66] on burgers because
[7160.66 → 7160.68] that's a line.
[7160.68 → 7160.86] Yeah, but what Linus
[7160.86 → 7161.54] is talking about
[7161.54 → 7162.84] is completely reasonable.
[7163.62 → 7163.86] What...
[7163.86 → 7166.32] What does it do better?
[7166.76 → 7167.28] It just holds itself...
[7167.28 → 7167.60] What do you mean
[7167.60 → 7168.46] it doesn't melt?
[7168.54 → 7169.86] It just holds itself
[7169.86 → 7171.10] together better.
[7171.38 → 7172.20] What the f***
[7172.20 → 7173.68] are people talking about?
[7174.16 → 7175.54] It works fine!
[7175.54 → 7177.62] This is user error!
[7177.74 → 7178.46] I'm sorry!
[7178.64 → 7179.06] So I think what I'm...
[7179.06 → 7180.40] If I'm...
[7180.40 → 7181.26] They don't split!
[7181.26 → 7182.46] ...can make an assumption here...
[7182.46 → 7183.44] What do you mean split?
[7183.44 → 7184.70] The burger's not going to get it
[7184.70 → 7185.32] up to the level
[7185.32 → 7186.66] where it's gonna, like,
[7187.06 → 7187.90] emulsify.
[7188.20 → 7189.50] De-emulsify what?
[7190.50 → 7192.04] We're talking about burgers!
[7193.88 → 7195.78] Yes, but...
[7195.78 → 7197.28] cheese is a suspension
[7197.28 → 7200.14] and the milk solids
[7200.14 → 7201.12] can separate out.
[7201.12 → 7202.40] But if you overheat, like,
[7202.52 → 7203.96] say, a cheese product
[7203.96 → 7205.08] in a fondue
[7205.08 → 7206.14] or, like, in a cheese sauce
[7206.14 → 7206.18] or something...
[7206.18 → 7207.32] But why would I do that?
[7207.50 → 7208.32] Well, you wouldn't
[7208.32 → 7209.44] on a burger,
[7209.76 → 7210.56] which is why I don't know
[7210.56 → 7211.50] why they're freaking out.
[7211.50 → 7212.24] But why would I do that
[7212.24 → 7213.24] in a cheese sauce either?
[7213.32 → 7214.62] Just control your temperature.
[7215.00 → 7216.10] Yeah, exactly.
[7217.36 → 7218.04] Like, yeah, this is...
[7218.04 → 7219.14] Just cook it right.
[7219.18 → 7219.86] This is like saying...
[7219.86 → 7220.84] Yeah, that's a great answer.
[7220.84 → 7221.84] No, this is like saying
[7221.84 → 7222.78] you need to use, like,
[7222.86 → 7222.96] garbage...
[7222.96 → 7223.80] Get good, scrub!
[7224.34 → 7225.14] ...garbage chocolate
[7225.14 → 7226.22] because you can't be arsed
[7226.22 → 7227.18] to use a double boiler.
[7227.32 → 7227.98] Like, what are we even
[7227.98 → 7228.78] talking about?
[7229.52 → 7229.92] I don't know.
[7229.92 → 7230.26] You don't know
[7230.26 → 7230.82] what you're cooking.
[7230.82 → 7231.10] You mean, like,
[7231.20 → 7232.22] tempering chocolate?
[7232.44 → 7233.32] Which sucks.
[7233.48 → 7234.28] You could just do that
[7234.28 → 7235.62] with an immersion circulator,
[7235.70 → 7237.10] but, like...
[7237.10 → 7237.92] Oh, my God!
[7237.98 → 7238.90] This is dumb!
[7239.34 → 7240.56] Just use normal cheese.
[7240.70 → 7241.50] It's fine, Linus.
[7241.66 → 7242.18] You don't need...
[7242.18 → 7242.50] I will!
[7242.50 → 7243.32] You don't need to have
[7243.32 → 7243.76] American cheese.
[7243.76 → 7244.48] The oil separating
[7244.48 → 7244.94] out of the cheese.
[7245.00 → 7245.72] Okay, are you talking about
[7245.72 → 7246.72] how the oil kind of pools
[7246.72 → 7248.40] on the top of the cheese?
[7248.50 → 7249.08] Like, it sweats?
[7249.30 → 7249.42] No!
[7249.42 → 7250.22] Is that what we're talking about
[7250.22 → 7250.92] when you heat it up?
[7251.30 → 7251.54] No!
[7251.54 → 7252.34] But that's what people...
[7252.34 → 7253.26] I'm reading the chat!
[7253.26 → 7254.56] Okay, when you're using real cheese,
[7254.62 → 7255.38] it kind of wraps itself
[7255.38 → 7255.90] around the burger
[7255.90 → 7256.44] a little bit, right?
[7256.60 → 7257.02] I mean, yeah,
[7257.06 → 7257.96] if you leave it in for too long.
[7257.96 → 7258.52] A little bit, sure.
[7258.70 → 7258.88] Okay.
[7259.02 → 7259.44] Well, why would you do that?
[7259.44 → 7260.32] I think what they're talking about
[7260.32 → 7261.00] is when you use
[7261.00 → 7262.98] the slice American cheese thing,
[7263.08 → 7264.66] it will literally keep its shape
[7264.66 → 7265.68] and, like, stick out
[7265.68 → 7266.94] even after being cooked.
[7267.20 → 7267.94] Because it becomes
[7267.94 → 7269.24] less heat-sensitive
[7269.24 → 7270.76] because it's basically...
[7270.76 → 7271.86] So it's not going to wrap
[7271.86 → 7272.36] around the burger.
[7272.46 → 7273.94] A singular block of goop.
[7273.96 → 7274.96] It keeps that, like,
[7275.04 → 7276.76] I am a square of cheese thing
[7276.76 → 7277.24] going on.
[7277.26 → 7278.72] If you want that behaviour...
[7278.72 → 7281.08] Also, the pull is way better.
[7281.30 → 7281.98] People are now saying,
[7282.08 → 7283.92] no, it doesn't do that.
[7284.22 → 7285.02] So I guess I'm wrong.
[7285.96 → 7286.80] I have no idea.
[7287.60 → 7288.66] Cheese stays on the burger.
[7288.98 → 7289.96] How are you guys
[7289.96 → 7290.94] knocking all the cheese
[7290.94 → 7291.44] off your burgers?
[7291.44 → 7291.86] That's not true
[7291.86 → 7292.22] unless you're talking
[7292.22 → 7293.14] about processed cheese food.
[7293.24 → 7293.98] Is that not what
[7293.98 → 7294.64] we're talking about?
[7297.12 → 7298.08] Literally the opposite.
[7298.22 → 7298.94] It melts more.
[7299.16 → 7300.08] It melts better.
[7300.74 → 7301.88] Other cheese separates
[7301.88 → 7303.00] even on a burger,
[7303.16 → 7304.40] which leads to way more oil.
[7304.40 → 7305.48] I have never had
[7305.48 → 7306.70] a piece of cheese
[7306.70 → 7307.84] separate on a burger
[7307.84 → 7308.78] in my entire life.
[7308.90 → 7309.86] The oil is already
[7309.86 → 7310.66] in the cheese.
[7310.90 → 7312.18] There isn't more oil.
[7312.18 → 7313.16] Okay, so what they're saying
[7313.16 → 7314.86] is that it melts more
[7314.86 → 7316.82] and wraps more
[7316.82 → 7317.86] around the burger.
[7318.08 → 7318.94] It wraps more
[7318.94 → 7319.80] around the burger.
[7319.90 → 7320.36] That's just because
[7320.36 → 7321.28] it's very thin.
[7322.08 → 7322.40] Yeah.
[7323.12 → 7324.04] Why would you want that?
[7324.14 → 7325.52] I like a big old thick
[7325.52 → 7326.76] I can afford cheese
[7326.76 → 7327.62] slice of cheese
[7327.62 → 7328.40] on my hamburger.
[7328.56 → 7329.92] I'm not going to put...
[7329.92 → 7331.28] I like this, actually.
[7331.50 → 7332.30] LMG exclusive
[7332.30 → 7333.46] Linus barbecues burgers
[7333.46 → 7334.40] with five different cheeses
[7334.40 → 7335.02] to test it out.
[7335.14 → 7336.24] I think that's great.
[7336.76 → 7338.16] I think that's fantastic.
[7339.16 → 7340.10] It's great for grilled cheese.
[7341.78 → 7342.54] You know what else
[7342.54 → 7343.46] is great for grilled cheese?
[7344.08 → 7345.44] Learning to just cut cheese
[7345.44 → 7346.68] evenly with a knife
[7346.68 → 7348.72] and then putting cheese
[7348.72 → 7349.90] on your grilled cheese.
[7350.02 → 7350.50] You do get some
[7350.50 → 7351.92] incredible strings.
[7352.14 → 7353.30] Dude, there's absolutely
[7353.30 → 7355.48] no way
[7355.48 → 7356.76] that I would put
[7356.76 → 7358.52] like American cheese
[7358.52 → 7360.32] at least like a Kraft single.
[7360.46 → 7361.20] Is that what we're talking about?
[7361.22 → 7362.20] We're talking about Kraft singles?
[7362.46 → 7363.00] That's what I thought
[7363.00 → 7363.52] we were talking about.
[7363.54 → 7364.16] Because that's my understanding.
[7364.28 → 7365.20] That's what I thought too?
[7365.36 → 7365.54] Yeah.
[7365.54 → 7369.18] I would rather eat plastic
[7369.18 → 7370.88] than eat Kraft singles
[7370.88 → 7372.04] on a grilled cheese sandwich.
[7372.52 → 7373.14] I'm sorry.
[7373.44 → 7373.96] I mean...
[7373.96 → 7374.46] They say...
[7374.46 → 7375.00] So, okay.
[7375.10 → 7375.84] So, American cheese
[7375.84 → 7377.28] especially when using
[7377.28 → 7379.12] a brand with emulsifiers
[7379.12 → 7380.42] like sodium citrate
[7380.42 → 7381.88] melts exceptionally well
[7381.88 → 7382.76] and creates a smooth
[7382.76 → 7383.76] fluid texture
[7383.76 → 7385.22] according to Bon Appétit.
[7386.08 → 7387.26] This contrasts
[7387.26 → 7388.06] with some other cheeses
[7388.06 → 7389.26] that might become
[7389.26 → 7390.50] clumpy or greasy
[7390.50 → 7391.16] when melted.
[7392.96 → 7393.88] Skill issue.
[7394.78 → 7395.42] Okay.
[7395.54 → 7396.38] What else we got here?
[7396.62 → 7397.82] What else we got this week?
[7397.88 → 7398.96] I'm gonna freaking lose it.
[7400.32 → 7400.68] And...
[7400.68 → 7401.38] And...
[7401.38 → 7402.24] So, Kraft singles
[7402.24 → 7403.14] are apparently bad.
[7403.52 → 7404.20] Whatever they use
[7404.20 → 7404.74] at Subway
[7404.74 → 7405.84] is also inedible.
[7406.60 → 7407.76] That stuff is trash.
[7408.52 → 7409.30] I wouldn't feed it
[7409.30 → 7409.96] to my dog.
[7410.60 → 7412.02] I don't even have a dog.
[7413.02 → 7413.22] Okay.
[7413.28 → 7414.06] If you want the properties
[7414.06 → 7415.06] of American cheese
[7415.06 → 7416.60] just follow the
[7416.60 → 7417.40] Chef's video
[7417.40 → 7418.60] and just get some
[7418.60 → 7419.30] real cheese
[7419.30 → 7419.98] and then just put
[7419.98 → 7421.16] some chemicals in it
[7421.16 → 7421.66] and you're done.
[7421.74 → 7422.46] It's real cheese
[7422.46 → 7423.22] but with chemicals.
[7423.68 → 7424.22] That's it.
[7424.22 → 7425.76] You processed it.
[7425.94 → 7426.84] Parisian is still mad
[7426.84 → 7427.38] that I'm saying
[7427.38 → 7427.92] it doesn't lead
[7427.92 → 7428.56] to more oil
[7428.56 → 7430.06] because the texture
[7430.06 → 7430.56] of the liquid
[7430.56 → 7431.10] is different.
[7431.32 → 7431.98] Yeah, but that's not
[7431.98 → 7432.76] more oil.
[7433.32 → 7433.94] That's just
[7433.94 → 7434.74] that the oil
[7434.74 → 7435.58] is on top of the...
[7435.58 → 7436.42] I mean...
[7436.42 → 7437.96] By the time
[7437.96 → 7438.34] you're taking
[7438.34 → 7439.46] a bite of a burger,
[7440.00 → 7442.06] a little bit of liquid oil
[7442.06 → 7442.82] in this thing,
[7443.04 → 7443.68] is that...
[7443.68 → 7444.58] Is that a concern?
[7445.00 → 7445.36] I mean,
[7445.36 → 7446.60] it's got a beef patty
[7446.60 → 7447.08] on it, right?
[7447.68 → 7448.56] Like, come on.
[7448.78 → 7449.12] I don't know.
[7449.22 → 7449.46] I don't...
[7449.46 → 7450.36] I've never seen oil
[7450.36 → 7451.54] with like Camembert
[7451.54 → 7452.46] or like a real cheese.
[7452.46 → 7453.22] You don't take
[7453.22 → 7454.02] the burger apart
[7454.02 → 7455.00] and like lick
[7455.00 → 7456.02] the top of the cheese.
[7456.20 → 7457.20] Why is the oil
[7457.20 → 7457.72] there a concern?
[7457.72 → 7458.04] Personally,
[7458.22 → 7458.96] I eat my burgers
[7458.96 → 7459.62] like Oreos,
[7459.72 → 7460.68] so I don't know
[7460.68 → 7461.30] what you're talking about.
[7461.92 → 7462.82] You dunk them in milk.
[7466.68 → 7467.68] It's like a hot dog
[7467.68 → 7468.34] eating competition.
[7468.60 → 7468.84] Gross.
[7469.92 → 7470.82] I want to see Linus
[7470.82 → 7472.38] do the cheese jar challenge.
[7472.50 → 7473.10] Oh God,
[7473.18 → 7474.38] that sounds awful.
[7474.50 → 7475.64] What is the cheese jar challenge?
[7475.64 → 7476.10] I don't know,
[7476.18 → 7476.86] but it sounds like
[7476.86 → 7478.28] it involves like cheese whiz.
[7478.36 → 7479.62] They made me eat cheese whiz
[7479.62 → 7482.52] as like a spin for punishment thing
[7482.52 → 7483.60] on a live stream a while back
[7483.60 → 7484.68] and I just about vomited.
[7485.16 → 7486.54] It was horrible.
[7487.90 → 7488.30] Horrible.
[7488.70 → 7489.56] This didn't even come up
[7489.56 → 7489.90] with anything.
[7490.00 → 7490.66] It came up with like
[7490.66 → 7493.00] the great jar trial
[7493.00 → 7495.60] from Ended Ring.
[7495.96 → 7496.94] I have no idea.
[7497.00 → 7498.28] We have 30 minutes left.
[7498.38 → 7498.90] Can we talk about
[7498.90 → 7500.18] not fake cheese?
[7500.32 → 7500.56] I mean,
[7500.66 → 7501.60] real cheese,
[7501.72 → 7502.42] but it just has
[7502.42 → 7503.26] emulsifiers in it.
[7504.10 → 7504.98] We can talk about
[7504.98 → 7505.94] the Slate truck,
[7506.28 → 7507.44] the $20,000
[7507.44 → 7508.98] American made pickup truck
[7508.98 → 7510.04] with no paint,
[7510.34 → 7511.40] no stereo,
[7511.72 → 7513.76] and no touchscreen.
[7514.22 → 7514.82] Sounds amazing.
[7515.18 → 7517.00] Michigan based Slate Auto
[7517.00 → 7517.84] has developed
[7517.84 → 7518.96] the Slate truck
[7518.96 → 7520.62] meant as a blank slate
[7520.62 → 7522.10] to be extremely customizable
[7522.10 → 7523.20] and extremely affordable.
[7523.74 → 7524.74] It's expected to be
[7524.74 → 7525.88] sub 20 grand
[7525.88 → 7526.96] after federal incentives,
[7527.12 → 7528.02] assuming those stick around,
[7528.54 → 7529.76] aiming for a production start
[7529.76 → 7530.94] in 2026.
[7531.82 → 7533.10] Instead of steel or aluminum,
[7533.36 → 7533.92] the body panels
[7533.92 → 7535.86] are unpainted moulded plastic
[7535.86 → 7537.30] or as Slate calls them,
[7537.78 → 7538.42] injection moulded
[7538.42 → 7539.80] polypropylene composite material.
[7540.34 → 7541.34] The unpainted body
[7541.34 → 7541.84] was designed
[7541.84 → 7542.62] to take advantage
[7542.62 → 7543.14] of the trend
[7543.14 → 7544.54] of vinyl wrapping cars.
[7545.06 → 7547.26] They offer vinyl wrap kits
[7547.26 → 7547.76] directly
[7547.76 → 7549.18] or you can DIY it.
[7549.66 → 7550.56] There's a configurator
[7550.56 → 7551.22] that is live
[7551.22 → 7551.90] on their site
[7551.90 → 7553.00] right now.
[7553.16 → 7553.34] Oh,
[7553.48 → 7554.56] personalize your Slate.
[7554.82 → 7555.82] Let's go.
[7556.34 → 7556.86] Boom.
[7557.36 → 7558.10] Slate truck.
[7559.70 → 7560.30] Environments.
[7561.26 → 7562.34] Colour dip.
[7562.34 → 7567.92] Okay.
[7568.92 → 7570.26] Click on personalize.
[7572.56 → 7573.30] Let's go.
[7574.42 → 7574.70] Yo.
[7577.28 → 7577.68] Nice.
[7579.24 → 7579.78] All right.
[7579.98 → 7581.32] So vinyl wraps.
[7581.62 → 7582.02] Definitely.
[7582.38 → 7582.68] Not gonna lie,
[7582.72 → 7583.18] this is cool.
[7584.02 → 7584.28] Okay.
[7584.34 → 7584.92] They even show like
[7584.92 → 7585.86] if you don't want to like
[7585.86 → 7586.68] go through all the work
[7586.68 → 7587.42] of getting like
[7587.42 → 7589.12] very legitimate speakers,
[7589.24 → 7590.12] you can just do this.
[7590.12 → 7592.96] Um.
[7595.20 → 7595.60] Wow.
[7595.88 → 7596.18] What?
[7596.40 → 7597.52] It's just a Bluetooth speaker.
[7597.70 → 7598.82] You just print a
[7598.88 → 7599.56] I'm assuming you're just
[7599.56 → 7600.94] 3D print a Bluetooth speaker.
[7600.94 → 7602.24] A hot dog holder.
[7602.50 → 7602.70] Yeah.
[7602.78 → 7603.52] That is hilarious.
[7603.96 → 7604.28] I'm just like,
[7604.30 → 7604.44] yeah,
[7604.48 → 7604.76] whatever.
[7605.04 → 7605.24] Just,
[7605.38 → 7605.74] you know,
[7605.80 → 7606.52] you want some sound,
[7606.60 → 7607.32] you don't want to pay for
[7607.32 → 7609.02] speakers throughout your truck.
[7609.28 → 7609.62] Done.
[7610.70 → 7612.02] The truck does not come
[7612.02 → 7613.02] with any infotainment
[7613.02 → 7613.66] at all,
[7613.80 → 7614.76] not even a radio.
[7614.76 → 7616.46] Um.
[7616.66 → 7617.50] Slate intends to make
[7617.50 → 7618.32] information regarding
[7618.32 → 7619.34] basic repair and maintenance
[7619.34 → 7620.08] available through a
[7620.08 → 7621.02] Slate University
[7621.02 → 7622.34] and they have a partnership
[7622.34 → 7623.68] with already established
[7623.68 → 7624.80] nationwide service centres
[7624.80 → 7626.14] for work on things like
[7626.14 → 7626.94] the high voltage system
[7626.94 → 7627.76] or for customers who
[7627.76 → 7628.48] just want the work
[7628.48 → 7629.16] taken care of.
[7629.40 → 7630.44] They will not be doing
[7630.44 → 7631.40] sailors through a dealership
[7631.40 → 7632.28] but through direct sales
[7632.28 → 7633.80] online and pickup locations
[7633.80 → 7635.04] similar to Tesla.
[7635.68 → 7636.64] So discussion question here
[7636.64 → 7637.94] is would you buy a vehicle
[7637.94 → 7639.16] that is lacking everything
[7639.16 → 7640.30] but the absolute basics?
[7641.86 → 7642.60] If you did,
[7642.70 → 7643.62] would you intend to drive
[7643.62 → 7644.34] it as is or would you
[7644.34 → 7645.42] upgrade it slash make it
[7645.42 → 7645.70] your own?
[7645.90 → 7646.60] I'd upgrade it and make it
[7646.60 → 7647.40] my own and I would
[7647.40 → 7648.22] absolutely buy one.
[7648.30 → 7648.40] Yeah.
[7648.56 → 7648.86] Sick.
[7649.32 → 7650.88] This actually seems
[7650.88 → 7652.32] super cool.
[7652.64 → 7653.30] Like it's one of those
[7653.30 → 7653.58] like,
[7654.04 → 7654.28] yeah,
[7654.36 → 7654.86] for real though,
[7654.92 → 7656.00] like I already have a phone.
[7656.14 → 7656.34] Yeah,
[7656.50 → 7656.70] whatever.
[7656.94 → 7657.18] Or a tablet.
[7657.64 → 7657.96] But like,
[7658.08 → 7659.24] and you could set up a
[7659.24 → 7660.10] screen in there that you
[7660.10 → 7661.04] connect your phone to
[7661.04 → 7662.54] that just like makes your
[7662.54 → 7663.44] phone screen bigger and
[7663.44 → 7664.44] easier to interact with.
[7664.44 → 7665.04] Like that's fine,
[7665.06 → 7665.72] but you can set that up
[7665.72 → 7667.06] yourself, or you just get
[7667.06 → 7667.90] one of those, and you're
[7667.90 → 7668.58] totally fine.
[7670.08 → 7670.46] Look,
[7670.52 → 7671.12] actual buttons.
[7671.12 → 7672.96] I am three trillion
[7672.96 → 7674.16] percent sure someone will
[7674.16 → 7675.18] come out with some,
[7675.32 → 7676.16] maybe slate will
[7676.16 → 7676.50] themselves,
[7676.72 → 7678.76] some way to add like
[7678.76 → 7679.72] proper speakers.
[7680.84 → 7681.32] Whatever.
[7683.44 → 7685.08] This seems legitimately
[7685.08 → 7685.72] pretty cool.
[7686.00 → 7686.60] That's sweet.
[7686.86 → 7687.74] I think Bezos backed
[7687.74 → 7688.06] it though.
[7688.40 → 7688.98] That's gross.
[7690.32 → 7691.34] Don't quote me on that.
[7691.48 → 7691.86] Hold on.
[7692.84 → 7693.24] Slate,
[7693.36 → 7693.74] truck,
[7693.74 → 7694.26] Bezos.
[7694.26 → 7694.84] It's still cool.
[7695.92 → 7696.56] Bezos backed,
[7696.64 → 7696.82] yes.
[7697.64 → 7698.08] Still cool.
[7698.22 → 7698.36] Yeah,
[7698.42 → 7698.68] you can,
[7698.76 → 7699.46] you can still get one.
[7699.52 → 7700.16] It's still pretty cool.
[7701.72 → 7702.96] You can make yourself feel
[7702.96 → 7703.82] better by just watching
[7703.82 → 7705.74] Bezos face-plant by the
[7705.74 → 7707.08] by the spaceship.
[7707.94 → 7708.86] Just watch it on,
[7708.94 → 7709.80] just watch it on loop
[7709.80 → 7710.54] for a little while.
[7711.00 → 7712.48] Have it like side by side
[7712.48 → 7713.10] because you're making a
[7713.10 → 7713.64] major purchase,
[7713.76 → 7713.84] right?
[7713.88 → 7714.78] So obviously you're at
[7714.78 → 7715.28] your computer.
[7715.52 → 7716.68] So you just put Bezos
[7716.68 → 7717.78] face-planting as your
[7717.78 → 7718.60] centre sort of subway
[7718.60 → 7719.50] surfers on the side
[7719.50 → 7720.90] and then you configure your
[7720.90 → 7722.06] slate truck and it kind of
[7722.06 → 7722.76] cancels it out.
[7722.76 → 7723.28] That's good.
[7724.04 → 7724.40] Um,
[7724.48 → 7726.14] the truck is all electric
[7726.14 → 7727.72] carrying a 52.7 kilowatt
[7727.72 → 7729.18] hour battery that powers a
[7729.18 → 7730.86] single rear motor producing
[7730.86 → 7733.68] 201 horsepower and 195
[7733.68 → 7734.88] foot pounds of torque.
[7735.08 → 7736.32] Acceleration from stop to 60
[7736.32 → 7737.34] miles per hour would take
[7737.34 → 7738.26] about eight seconds,
[7738.62 → 7740.70] which is this was 20 years
[7740.70 → 7742.40] ago would be like amazing.
[7742.90 → 7744.06] So it's probably fine.
[7744.10 → 7744.88] You're probably okay.
[7744.98 → 7745.38] Relax.
[7745.38 → 7746.30] Uh,
[7746.30 → 7747.24] driving range is estimated
[7747.24 → 7750.10] 150 miles and there's an
[7750.10 → 7752.12] optional 84.3 kilowatt-hour
[7752.12 → 7752.48] battery,
[7752.48 → 7753.28] which will increase the
[7753.28 → 7754.82] range to 240 miles.
[7755.02 → 7755.10] Oh,
[7755.12 → 7755.44] that's pretty good.
[7755.44 → 7756.82] There's also a dual motor
[7756.82 → 7758.92] all-wheel drive powertrain,
[7759.02 → 7759.66] um,
[7759.66 → 7760.58] that is potentially in the
[7760.58 → 7762.28] works, and it charges with
[7762.28 → 7763.98] Tesla style ports.
[7764.92 → 7765.40] Yeah,
[7765.40 → 7765.98] I think those are going to
[7765.98 → 7766.32] win now.
[7766.74 → 7768.40] Payload tops out at 1433
[7768.40 → 7769.00] pounds,
[7769.68 → 7770.94] towing at a thousand pounds.
[7770.94 → 7773.58] This is like more than what
[7773.58 → 7775.34] almost everyone needs that
[7775.34 → 7776.98] the whole like zero to 60
[7776.98 → 7777.62] time thing.
[7778.06 → 7778.76] Like what?
[7779.34 → 7780.26] It's cool.
[7780.74 → 7782.20] Most people aren't going to
[7782.20 → 7782.90] really care.
[7783.24 → 7784.90] I think we got past the
[7784.90 → 7785.84] point where it really
[7785.84 → 7786.86] matters to the vast majority
[7786.86 → 7787.22] of people.
[7787.54 → 7788.70] And if you want to have fun
[7788.70 → 7789.42] with your Porsche,
[7789.82 → 7790.58] go for it.
[7790.62 → 7790.88] I do.
[7790.98 → 7791.76] But like most people that
[7791.76 → 7792.96] want a $20,000 truck,
[7793.10 → 7794.28] like dude,
[7794.70 → 7795.82] can it get up to speed
[7795.82 → 7798.06] within a safe period of time
[7798.06 → 7798.98] on the highway?
[7799.26 → 7799.66] Yes.
[7799.82 → 7800.22] Cool.
[7800.22 → 7800.86] I'm like,
[7801.12 → 7801.64] outside of that,
[7801.70 → 7802.26] it doesn't really matter
[7802.26 → 7802.54] much.
[7803.00 → 7803.88] That's fair enough.
[7804.04 → 7804.92] This is sweet.
[7805.34 → 7805.50] Uh,
[7805.58 → 7806.46] SoCal Tech Fair.
[7807.20 → 7808.02] Apparently we're a
[7808.02 → 7808.38] sponsor.
[7809.24 → 7809.60] Nice.
[7809.80 → 7810.56] That's super cool.
[7810.72 → 7811.10] Let's go.
[7811.34 → 7812.42] Our team's been working
[7812.42 → 7813.76] on getting some,
[7813.76 → 7813.92] oh.
[7815.60 → 7815.86] What?
[7816.10 → 7816.36] What?
[7816.58 → 7816.84] What?
[7816.84 → 7817.20] What?
[7817.50 → 7818.34] What's he doing there?
[7818.48 → 7819.06] Meet and greet,
[7819.26 → 7820.38] meet and greet with the one,
[7820.48 → 7822.60] the one and only Colton Potter.
[7822.86 → 7824.02] We fired him, and now he's
[7824.02 → 7825.24] working for them?
[7826.04 → 7826.92] Imagine that.
[7827.42 → 7828.22] What a guy.
[7828.96 → 7829.24] Um,
[7829.28 → 7829.50] anyway,
[7829.50 → 7829.84] hold on.
[7829.88 → 7831.00] There are a bunch of notes
[7831.00 → 7831.56] in the doc.
[7831.64 → 7833.02] So this is Jay's Two Cent
[7833.02 → 7834.02] slash Heights.
[7834.54 → 7834.94] Um,
[7835.02 → 7836.60] SoCal Tech Fair happening
[7836.60 → 7837.40] in the city of Industry,
[7837.54 → 7838.88] California on May the 3rd and 4th.
[7838.88 → 7839.64] Our team is sponsoring
[7839.64 → 7841.66] the Tower of Power booth activity
[7841.66 → 7842.88] where you can take part
[7842.88 → 7844.24] in a frantic 2v2 motherboard
[7844.24 → 7845.18] stacking face-off
[7845.18 → 7847.02] to see which tech community team
[7847.02 → 7848.04] gets the highest height
[7848.04 → 7848.84] in under two minutes.
[7849.36 → 7850.24] Random hardware provided,
[7850.38 → 7851.14] stacking ability skills
[7851.14 → 7852.32] unfortunately optional.
[7852.32 → 7853.46] You can win
[7853.46 → 7854.68] lgtsore.com prizes
[7854.68 → 7856.22] including commuter backpacks,
[7856.38 → 7856.92] screwdrivers,
[7857.32 → 7858.16] magnetic cable management,
[7858.32 → 7858.74] sticker packs,
[7858.82 → 7859.60] and more.
[7860.38 → 7861.40] And if you come on Sunday,
[7861.58 → 7862.20] Colton will be there
[7862.20 → 7862.46] to say,
[7862.52 → 7862.72] hi,
[7862.78 → 7863.50] and you're fired.
[7864.80 → 7865.98] Good catchphrase.
[7866.04 → 7866.60] Has anyone ever thought
[7866.60 → 7866.98] of that before?
[7867.46 → 7868.46] Some other cool things
[7868.46 → 7869.26] happening at the event.
[7869.50 → 7871.38] There's an AMD CPU trade-in offer.
[7871.56 → 7872.36] While supplies last,
[7872.42 → 7874.30] you can trade any AMD CPU
[7874.30 → 7875.36] in any condition
[7875.36 → 7877.22] and get a free ultimate upgrade
[7877.22 → 7878.22] to the AMD family,
[7878.66 → 7880.44] an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X
[7880.44 → 7882.30] and an Asus B650 motherboard combo
[7882.30 → 7885.16] that also qualifies
[7885.16 → 7886.18] toward a free copy
[7886.18 → 7887.20] of Monster Hunter Wild?
[7887.34 → 7887.46] Sorry,
[7887.48 → 7888.08] how does this work?
[7888.44 → 7889.24] There's got to be,
[7889.92 → 7890.40] it's got to,
[7890.48 → 7891.98] is it like a raffle or something?
[7892.14 → 7892.22] Sorry,
[7892.34 → 7894.22] what is this?
[7894.92 → 7895.38] Hold on.
[7895.70 → 7897.48] Where's the info on this?
[7898.84 → 7899.32] Okay,
[7899.56 → 7900.86] SoCal Tech Fair,
[7901.66 → 7902.70] Control F,
[7903.14 → 7903.58] AMD.
[7903.58 → 7906.78] AMD Cares Trade-In Program.
[7907.42 → 7908.20] There's got to be,
[7908.66 → 7909.78] while supplies last.
[7909.78 → 7910.98] While supplies last is,
[7911.34 → 7911.72] is,
[7912.06 → 7912.86] I'm assuming,
[7912.98 → 7913.86] a big part of this.
[7913.86 → 7915.06] This trade-in is limited
[7915.06 → 7915.82] per day,
[7915.90 → 7917.28] per individual paid ticket holders.
[7917.68 → 7917.86] Oh,
[7917.92 → 7919.64] it's basically a sweepstake then.
[7920.92 → 7921.36] Yeah,
[7921.52 → 7922.66] I think it's a sweepstake.
[7922.86 → 7924.22] I think they mean ticket holders
[7924.22 → 7925.34] as in ticket to the event.
[7925.50 → 7925.70] Yeah,
[7926.02 → 7926.32] I know.
[7926.76 → 7927.64] How's it a sweepstake?
[7927.88 → 7928.06] Well,
[7928.14 → 7929.68] because not everyone
[7929.68 → 7930.84] who buys a ticket to the event
[7930.84 → 7931.72] is going to win it.
[7932.52 → 7933.18] Test your luck.
[7933.60 → 7934.24] Test your luck
[7934.24 → 7935.54] on the AMD Pinko board
[7935.54 → 7936.56] to receive tickets
[7936.56 → 7938.42] to win daily GPU giveaways.
[7939.06 → 7939.18] Wait.
[7939.50 → 7939.68] Yeah,
[7939.74 → 7940.78] that's a separate thing.
[7941.22 → 7941.62] Because of course
[7941.62 → 7942.50] it gets even more loaded.
[7942.68 → 7943.36] Sign up and enter
[7943.36 → 7944.64] yet another free PC giveaway
[7944.64 → 7945.70] with two times the chances
[7945.70 → 7946.08] to win.
[7946.08 → 7946.26] That's another separate thing.
[7946.64 → 7946.80] Okay,
[7946.88 → 7947.56] depending on,
[7947.94 → 7948.50] AMD Cares,
[7948.74 → 7949.18] so fair,
[7949.34 → 7950.32] challenge rating.
[7951.16 → 7952.00] Challenge rating.
[7952.80 → 7953.74] What are these coins?
[7954.40 → 7954.66] Or the
[7954.88 → 7955.90] they're bank coins.
[7956.46 → 7956.72] What?
[7956.92 → 7957.56] They're bank coins.
[7957.56 → 7958.56] AMD Cares,
[7958.82 → 7960.30] depending on trade-in restrictions,
[7960.66 → 7961.34] TBD.
[7962.64 → 7963.50] Five minutes,
[7963.84 → 7964.62] limited trade-in,
[7964.72 → 7965.62] while supplies last.
[7965.70 → 7965.84] I mean,
[7965.88 → 7965.98] yeah,
[7966.02 → 7966.38] there's going to be,
[7966.40 → 7966.80] there's going to be
[7966.80 → 7967.74] some kind of gating.
[7967.88 → 7969.22] There's absolutely no way
[7969.22 → 7970.16] that every single person
[7970.16 → 7970.54] who attends
[7970.54 → 7971.90] is getting a free CPU
[7971.90 → 7972.38] and motherboard,
[7972.58 → 7972.74] so.
[7973.20 → 7973.70] It's got to be
[7973.70 → 7975.18] the while supplies last part.
[7975.56 → 7975.96] Yeah,
[7976.38 → 7976.98] I mean,
[7977.04 → 7977.46] good luck.
[7978.14 → 7978.74] Good luck
[7978.74 → 7980.18] with getting that
[7980.18 → 7981.04] because that seems
[7981.04 → 7982.36] like a very good deal.
[7983.22 → 7983.66] Also,
[7983.78 → 7984.58] burrower is going to have
[7984.58 → 7986.16] a GPU garage sale.
[7987.08 → 7987.72] You can learn more
[7987.72 → 7988.20] and get tickets
[7988.20 → 7988.74] by searching
[7988.74 → 7990.36] SoCal Tech Fair
[7990.36 → 7991.22] or at the link
[7991.22 → 7992.40] in the video description.
[7993.16 → 7993.48] Also,
[7994.16 → 7996.36] the Brink Pentathlon 2025.
[7996.88 → 7997.68] The LTT Forum
[7997.68 → 7998.12] Brink team
[7998.12 → 7998.90] will be competing
[7998.90 → 8000.36] in the Brink Pentathlon 2025
[8000.36 → 8001.36] running from May 5th
[8001.36 → 8002.44] to May 19th.
[8002.82 → 8003.30] In this event,
[8003.36 → 8004.00] we'll go up against
[8004.00 → 8004.86] other tech communities
[8004.86 → 8006.24] by contributing computing power
[8006.24 → 8006.80] through Brink
[8006.80 → 8008.28] to support scientific research
[8008.28 → 8009.14] and progress.
[8009.64 → 8010.86] While only Brink points
[8010.86 → 8012.08] count toward the Pentathlon
[8012.08 → 8013.02] will also be tracking
[8013.02 → 8013.90] folding at home stats
[8013.90 → 8015.04] for anyone signed up.
[8015.20 → 8015.98] If you want to join
[8015.98 → 8016.50] the competition
[8016.50 → 8017.32] and support science,
[8017.48 → 8018.72] you can find all the details
[8018.72 → 8019.56] and sign up info
[8019.56 → 8020.50] on the LTT Forum.
[8020.60 → 8021.78] That's lanustechtips.com.
[8022.02 → 8022.78] Just look for the
[8022.78 → 8026.24] Brink Pentathlon 2025 thread.
[8027.30 → 8027.84] All right,
[8027.86 → 8028.58] it's time for After Dark.
[8031.80 → 8033.80] I assume I can find this easily.
[8034.26 → 8035.10] Not Boeing.
[8035.48 → 8035.88] Brink.
[8036.30 → 8037.72] B-O-I-N-C.
[8038.18 → 8038.52] Brink.
[8039.52 → 8040.60] Where would they have posted that?
[8040.60 → 8041.24] Probably here, right?
[8041.62 → 8041.78] Yeah,
[8041.78 → 8042.24] here we go.
[8043.10 → 8043.50] Community.
[8044.74 → 8044.98] Book.
[8045.16 → 8046.06] Brink Pentathlon.
[8048.06 → 8049.24] It's just Pentathlon.
[8049.90 → 8050.82] There's no second A.
[8051.84 → 8052.08] Oh.
[8052.74 → 8053.28] Pentathlon?
[8053.28 → 8053.90] Common mistake.
[8054.36 → 8054.48] Hmm.
[8057.08 → 8058.48] Pentathlon sounds better.
[8058.66 → 8058.90] I know.
[8058.96 → 8060.56] Some Mandela effect here.
[8061.32 → 8062.30] Bernstein bears.
[8062.74 → 8063.06] Yeah.
[8064.80 → 8065.28] Bernstein.
[8066.78 → 8067.38] Bernstein?
[8067.38 → 8068.44] Bernstein?
[8068.66 → 8069.06] Bernstein.
[8069.38 → 8069.94] Oh, yeah.
[8071.70 → 8072.80] After Dark, let's go.
[8073.00 → 8074.10] Are they even bears?
[8074.84 → 8076.78] All right, I got some March messages here for you.
[8077.04 → 8078.12] The one that gets me the most
[8078.12 → 8080.04] is the Fruit of the Loom cornucopia thing.
[8080.26 → 8081.46] Yeah, it messed me up.
[8081.62 → 8082.70] That one, like, had a...
[8082.70 → 8083.26] I did it.
[8083.50 → 8084.94] Do they not have a cornucopia?
[8084.94 → 8086.68] The claim is that they don't.
[8086.82 → 8086.90] What?
[8086.90 → 8091.36] But I specifically remember learning what that was
[8091.36 → 8094.18] because of asking my mom about the...
[8094.18 → 8095.76] Yeah, apparently that's not a thing.
[8095.90 → 8096.14] What?
[8096.80 → 8097.54] Yeah, no, I don't.
[8097.62 → 8097.98] It says fact check.
[8098.06 → 8098.54] Click into it.
[8098.54 → 8098.86] Let's see.
[8098.86 → 8100.30] I do not believe that at all.
[8100.36 → 8100.50] What?
[8100.50 → 8101.52] I don't believe it either, man.
[8101.54 → 8102.02] Are you sure?
[8103.22 → 8104.94] Yeah, the Fruit of the Loom logo that never contained a...
[8105.94 → 8106.66] What?
[8106.76 → 8107.94] No, this I've never seen, but...
[8108.48 → 8108.74] What?
[8109.98 → 8110.26] Rating false?
[8110.26 → 8110.98] Rating false.
[8110.98 → 8111.10] False.
[8111.74 → 8113.24] So it did, basically.
[8113.46 → 8113.76] No, no, no.
[8113.76 → 8114.60] Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.
[8115.24 → 8117.80] The claim is that it didn't, and then that's false.
[8118.80 → 8119.44] Yeah, okay.
[8119.44 → 8120.78] At some point in the past, the Fruit of the Loom's cornucopia...
[8120.78 → 8121.28] No, no, no.
[8121.68 → 8121.94] Yeah.
[8122.28 → 8122.88] Fact check.
[8123.06 → 8124.48] It has never contained one.
[8124.68 → 8124.88] What?
[8125.20 → 8125.92] Rating false.
[8126.12 → 8126.28] Yeah.
[8126.76 → 8127.92] Okay, scroll up slightly.
[8128.08 → 8128.30] What?
[8128.34 → 8128.94] It's happening.
[8129.14 → 8129.38] Stop there.
[8129.60 → 8131.14] Read the claim and then read the rating.
[8131.28 → 8133.18] At some point, it contained a cornucopia.
[8133.32 → 8134.20] That is false.
[8134.46 → 8134.74] Oh.
[8135.40 → 8137.76] Meaning they're saying that it did not contain a cornucopia.
[8137.76 → 8139.66] But I don't believe that.
[8139.84 → 8140.20] I refuse.
[8140.20 → 8141.54] I also refuse to believe that.
[8141.54 → 8141.66] What?
[8141.82 → 8143.10] There's no way, dude.
[8144.70 → 8145.98] It's been disproved.
[8146.04 → 8147.10] What's been disproved?
[8147.24 → 8148.78] That it contained a cornucopia.
[8149.96 → 8151.38] Is strongly held.
[8152.76 → 8153.16] An image of a purported...
[8153.16 → 8154.94] They're saying that's not real.
[8154.98 → 8155.74] But that...
[8155.74 → 8156.08] What?
[8156.38 → 8158.30] Which there's, like, no way.
[8159.88 → 8160.32] What?
[8160.74 → 8163.58] This is a fabrication, not an actual Fruit of the Loom logo.
[8163.68 → 8165.64] Like, what are you talking about?
[8166.12 → 8167.14] There's no way.
[8167.14 → 8170.14] The only thing that I thought of was we used to...
[8171.00 → 8173.18] They disprove Fruit of the Loom's claim.
[8173.94 → 8174.66] Is that true?
[8179.12 → 8181.40] Did it never contain a cornucopia?
[8182.72 → 8185.96] Okay, because this actually looks pretty familiar to me as well.
[8188.12 → 8190.22] This looked very familiar, though.
[8190.22 → 8192.28] I swear that one's real.
[8192.40 → 8193.68] This site apparently...
[8193.68 → 8195.74] Maybe their logo has emulsifiers in it, too.
[8197.12 → 8197.96] Fruit of the Loom.
[8198.68 → 8199.38] I mean...
[8199.38 → 8200.44] There's proof they did.
[8200.48 → 8201.20] It was marketing.
[8201.48 → 8203.94] But then why does this thing say the claim is false?
[8204.20 → 8205.66] Well, this is Yahoo Finance.
[8205.88 → 8206.12] I don't know.
[8206.18 → 8206.56] I...
[8206.56 → 8208.08] This doesn't look right to me, though.
[8208.08 → 8210.82] Found in thrift stores.
[8210.98 → 8215.94] More examples sent to Slopes appear to have their origins in a June 2020, among other things.
[8216.00 → 8220.60] The other example from a TikTok video proposed cover-up as one of the greatest marketing ploys in history.
[8220.68 → 8225.36] The provenance of these photos is unknown, and as a result, their utility as evidence is limited.
[8227.08 → 8227.72] Uh...
[8227.72 → 8228.60] Okay.
[8229.70 → 8230.64] I don't know, man.
[8231.64 → 8233.16] People are saying the site is wrong.
[8235.32 → 8236.10] Yeah, I don't know.
[8236.10 → 8237.76] I'm very upset right now.
[8238.72 → 8241.64] I could have sworn it had a thing.
[8242.78 → 8243.40] Wait.
[8243.54 → 8246.08] An early version did have it, but it was dropped?
[8246.34 → 8247.36] What is this?
[8248.26 → 8248.90] Oh, no.
[8249.52 → 8250.20] Oh, no.
[8250.94 → 8251.88] Oh, no.
[8252.40 → 8252.78] Okay.
[8253.04 → 8253.10] Well...
[8255.78 → 8260.58] Okay.
[8261.16 → 8262.10] Well, anyway.
[8262.56 → 8263.14] After Dark.
[8263.14 → 8265.90] Oh, man.
[8265.94 → 8266.42] I'm so upset.
[8266.62 → 8271.54] I was also a Shazam Kazan bamboozled earlier.
[8271.82 → 8272.82] I was bamboozled.
[8273.50 → 8273.78] I...
[8273.78 → 8275.26] Whatever the wrong one is.
[8275.34 → 8281.40] I thought that Sinbad was in a movie called Kazan, but it's actually Shaw in a movie called Shazam or whatever.
[8281.80 → 8286.02] Like, I could have sworn I remembered seeing a VHS of Sinbad as a genie.
[8286.32 → 8287.60] But apparently that never happened.
[8287.74 → 8288.04] So...
[8288.04 → 8288.32] Yeah.
[8288.32 → 8288.76] Yeah.
[8288.88 → 8289.76] It's a whole thing.
[8289.84 → 8290.68] Mandela effect, man.
[8290.80 → 8293.88] The cornucopia thing, like, I refuse to give up on that.
[8294.14 → 8303.74] Because I very specifically remember being in the car, coming from a thrift store, having bought a Fruit of the Loom thing and asked my mom what that thing was and her explaining the word cornucopia.
[8303.86 → 8305.54] That's how I learned the word cornucopia.
[8305.54 → 8306.90] It was from the Fruit of the Loom logo.
[8307.10 → 8307.26] Yeah.
[8307.26 → 8308.38] So, I don't know.
[8308.46 → 8309.86] Do you think there could have been knock offs?
[8310.02 → 8310.30] Maybe?
[8310.48 → 8310.64] Yeah.
[8310.92 → 8316.76] That's the only theory that's made sense to me because back then we got a lot of stuff from thrift stores and secondhand and stuff like that.
[8316.84 → 8317.46] Same here, yeah.
[8317.54 → 8318.86] And maybe.
[8319.32 → 8319.54] Maybe.
[8320.02 → 8320.24] Maybe.
[8320.48 → 8322.36] But why are you knocking off Fruit of the Loom?
[8323.30 → 8324.28] I don't know anymore.
[8324.50 → 8325.76] That's the last remaining thing for me.
[8325.82 → 8327.50] It's like, weren't they cheap in the first place?
[8327.56 → 8329.68] Maybe that's why this timeline is so messed up.
[8329.78 → 8330.38] So...
[8330.38 → 8331.92] They changed something.
[8332.10 → 8334.40] Who's making a knock off version of the cheap brand?
[8334.40 → 8337.24] I understand the Fruit of the Loom website says no, I don't care.
[8338.28 → 8339.46] I don't believe it.
[8339.56 → 8340.20] He doesn't care.
[8340.30 → 8341.02] He doesn't believe it.
[8341.12 → 8341.34] Okay.
[8341.58 → 8341.98] All right.
[8342.82 → 8345.60] Why has email not changed in the past 20 years?
[8345.80 → 8348.48] Number one time annoying thing in business is email.
[8348.86 → 8352.42] Why haven't anyone come up with a more efficient way to process email?
[8353.02 → 8355.22] Threads changed in the last 20 years.
[8355.22 → 8355.90] Threads was a dramatic change.
[8355.96 → 8357.22] That was a huge change.
[8357.40 → 8357.80] Massive.
[8357.80 → 8363.34] I mean, there are still a lot of issues like formatting and like text formatting and like
[8363.34 → 8367.88] reply formatting in email chains when people are using different services or clients can
[8367.88 → 8368.96] still get a little bit messy.
[8369.06 → 8375.30] But overall, email is for me, not the number one most annoying thing.
[8375.42 → 8380.18] It's actually really annoying when people send me anything that needs actual thought
[8380.18 → 8382.52] put into it via any means other than email.
[8382.52 → 8388.98] Because as soon as I have read something like on my phone, if it requires more than two seconds
[8388.98 → 8391.90] of thought, I can't reply to you right now because I'm in the middle of something.
[8392.08 → 8395.96] And I will never think to reply to you again because now it isn't marked on read, and it's
[8395.96 → 8401.00] not sitting in my email where it can be carefully organized and isn't just going to get buried
[8401.00 → 8405.92] the next time someone messages me something because the way that sorting works on messaging
[8405.92 → 8409.34] apps is not ideal for the way that my ADD brain works.
[8409.34 → 8413.72] Um, and there are more efficient ways to process emails.
[8413.90 → 8415.92] There's like priority view in your Gmail inbox.
[8416.14 → 8419.18] Um, there's like AI reply help.
[8419.36 → 8421.00] If you're able to sort by unread.
[8421.28 → 8423.28] Oh, it's probably in the last 20 years.
[8423.36 → 8423.44] Yeah.
[8423.44 → 8424.22] Huge difference maker.
[8424.36 → 8425.78] Email has definitely changed.
[8426.00 → 8430.08] Email was, was largely processed on like email clients.
[8430.08 → 8436.56] And I remember it was like an actual job back in like the Geese Squad era, uh, to, to like
[8436.56 → 8440.84] backup people's email files so that you could transfer them to their new computer and stuff
[8440.84 → 8443.20] like the email has dramatically changed.
[8443.36 → 8444.20] It's way better.
[8445.04 → 8445.90] Way better now.
[8445.98 → 8447.16] The search in Gmail sucks.
[8447.28 → 8448.54] But other than that, it's way better.
[8449.34 → 8450.34] It's really wild.
[8450.70 → 8451.06] Oh crap.
[8451.32 → 8452.46] Don't do that, Lionfish.
[8453.28 → 8454.22] We both cleared.
[8454.56 → 8455.50] And so we cleared two.
[8456.14 → 8456.42] Oh.
[8456.90 → 8458.96] Uh, I'll read one while I look for it.
[8459.28 → 8460.02] Question for Luke.
[8460.14 → 8463.08] If you could, would you own bigger birds like parrot sized?
[8463.54 → 8463.90] No.
[8464.22 → 8466.90] Because if he could, he probably wouldn't own the size of birds he has now.
[8468.34 → 8469.48] Never thought about that.
[8469.58 → 8470.58] Fun fact, you can.
[8470.70 → 8473.02] We have to do seven medications a day right now.
[8473.02 → 8474.56] You wouldn't even have to squeeze that hard.
[8475.04 → 8475.96] Oh my God.
[8476.50 → 8477.88] We have to do seven medications a day right now.
[8477.88 → 8478.84] Can sell it to a blind kid.
[8478.84 → 8484.82] And, my God, and we have to give them milk, milk thistle, milk thistle.
[8484.90 → 8485.68] I think that's milk thistle.
[8486.14 → 8487.54] Medicated water, basically.
[8488.90 → 8490.66] It's, it's crazy.
[8491.10 → 8491.32] Okay.
[8491.44 → 8491.72] Okay.
[8491.80 → 8493.28] Here out, charge nuclei.
[8493.82 → 8494.24] Chickens.
[8495.18 → 8496.28] I bet you don't, chickens.
[8497.10 → 8498.02] I used to keep chickens.
[8498.80 → 8499.50] 10 out of 10 birds.
[8499.52 → 8501.26] Chickens are probably the only one.
[8501.40 → 8503.68] And it's because they have a utility.
[8504.98 → 8507.38] I mean, technically, budgies have the same utility.
[8507.38 → 8509.38] You're just, you just have a hang-up about it.
[8509.90 → 8510.98] Eating their eggs?
[8511.62 → 8514.88] Well, I mean, not everybody just eats the chicken eggs.
[8515.10 → 8515.38] Oh.
[8516.50 → 8518.30] There's really not a lot of meat on a budget.
[8518.30 → 8519.14] They got feet, too.
[8519.16 → 8520.60] I'm not saying it has a ton of utility.
[8520.60 → 8522.38] It would hardly even constitute a snack.
[8522.46 → 8523.60] I'm just saying it has some.
[8523.60 → 8524.26] Like, legitimately.
[8524.44 → 8525.78] I'm just saying it has some.
[8526.00 → 8526.60] Bagel bite?
[8527.84 → 8529.04] No, I don't even, like.
[8529.42 → 8530.12] A biscuit.
[8530.12 → 8532.92] Just a little biscuit with melted cheese.
[8533.82 → 8534.70] Proper cheese.
[8535.46 → 8536.18] And then a little bit.
[8537.38 → 8539.92] But then it might not be properly melted, Linus.
[8540.30 → 8541.84] You clearly don't know how to cook.
[8541.94 → 8542.28] Shut up.
[8542.78 → 8543.18] Shut up.
[8548.28 → 8548.72] Anyway.
[8549.24 → 8554.50] I just want a no-context shirt with a burger patty with melted cheese on the top of it.
[8556.28 → 8559.42] I've sent so, Nick, so many messages this evening.
[8559.72 → 8560.46] What was I going to say?
[8561.26 → 8561.98] Yeah, no.
[8562.10 → 8562.86] Indoor birds.
[8563.02 → 8565.02] I don't want a bigger one because the poop is a problem.
[8565.02 → 8567.78] Budgies, the poop's not really that big of a deal.
[8567.90 → 8569.88] But I want to be able to allow them to fly.
[8570.08 → 8574.08] So if you have a larger bird that has big, goofy poop, you don't want that flying all over the place.
[8574.50 → 8576.68] There's pictures people have shown me of, like, their monitors.
[8578.10 → 8581.48] And the back of their monitor is just, like, covered in...
[8582.08 → 8583.34] It's gross.
[8583.54 → 8583.86] It's gross.
[8584.20 → 8584.70] Don't want that.
[8584.70 → 8590.44] In response to the next merch message, this is not my wife.
[8592.76 → 8593.16] What?
[8593.86 → 8595.20] This is not my wife.
[8595.82 → 8596.16] Oh.
[8596.16 → 8598.58] Our next merch message.
[8599.32 → 8603.00] This is a Hong Kong-based actor.
[8603.60 → 8604.36] She's 50.
[8604.60 → 8606.04] She's a little old for me.
[8608.98 → 8613.20] Pretty impressive filmography, which is nice and good for her.
[8613.28 → 8615.24] But she is not, in fact, my wife.
[8615.36 → 8617.04] So this next merch message.
[8617.60 → 8618.34] Hello, Linus.
[8618.70 → 8620.64] You've mentioned Yvonne is from Hong Kong.
[8620.82 → 8622.56] As someone else who married a girl from Hong Kong,
[8622.56 → 8625.86] I was wondering if you've taught the kids Cantonese and go back to visit from time to time.
[8626.08 → 8628.32] I have never said my wife is from Hong Kong.
[8629.70 → 8631.26] She is not from Hong Kong.
[8633.36 → 8637.38] We do go back to visit the country that she is actually from,
[8637.94 → 8640.16] which is Malaysia slash Brunei.
[8640.68 → 8642.94] But, I don't know, once every 10 years or so.
[8643.06 → 8644.26] We actually just went back.
[8644.74 → 8647.72] And Yvonne does not speak Cantonese.
[8648.12 → 8650.74] She speaks a little bit of Mandarin from when she was a kid,
[8650.74 → 8652.38] but barely these days.
[8653.12 → 8654.52] Yeah, Mandela effect again.
[8654.72 → 8655.48] Here we go.
[8655.94 → 8656.84] Here we go.
[8659.80 → 8661.32] Not Scrappy DP.
[8661.42 → 8662.08] I'm not being mean.
[8662.22 → 8663.42] I'm not saying she's old.
[8663.52 → 8665.42] I'm just saying she's a little old for me.
[8666.38 → 8668.22] She's 11 years older than me.
[8669.62 → 8670.10] What?
[8672.26 → 8672.70] What?
[8673.52 → 8676.24] You know, when people get to a certain age.
[8676.40 → 8676.72] Yes.
[8676.96 → 8678.60] Their age band tends to increase.
[8678.74 → 8679.50] Their age band?
[8679.50 → 8681.22] Yeah, what they're acceptable with.
[8681.22 → 8683.14] And I'm just saying maybe you're up there.
[8683.52 → 8684.32] Maybe I'm up there.
[8684.52 → 8684.72] Yeah.
[8684.84 → 8685.14] Really?
[8690.64 → 8691.50] How old are you now?
[8692.04 → 8692.52] Thirty-
[8692.52 → 8693.38] Don't worry about it.
[8693.46 → 8693.70] Eight?
[8693.70 → 8695.94] Hold on.
[8696.00 → 8696.56] Which one is it?
[8696.70 → 8696.94] Crap.
[8698.22 → 8698.62] Yes.
[8698.78 → 8699.36] Barely, though.
[8699.50 → 8699.68] Yeah.
[8699.72 → 8699.98] Okay.
[8700.22 → 8700.40] Yeah.
[8700.40 → 8700.58] Yeah.
[8700.58 → 8700.74] Yeah.
[8700.74 → 8700.80] Yeah.
[8700.98 → 8702.84] So if you went...
[8702.84 → 8707.30] There are definitely 38-year-olds that would date 27-year-olds.
[8707.30 → 8713.86] And I might say, I don't know, they seem a little old for you.
[8715.04 → 8715.52] Young?
[8716.12 → 8716.70] Well, okay.
[8716.78 → 8718.62] The thing is, young?
[8719.28 → 8719.66] A little.
[8719.76 → 8719.88] Yeah.
[8719.92 → 8721.86] They're dating down 11 years.
[8722.52 → 8723.68] I don't think they're a little old.
[8723.68 → 8723.92] Oh, sorry.
[8723.96 → 8724.16] No, no.
[8724.20 → 8725.68] I thought we were going the other way.
[8725.86 → 8726.06] Okay.
[8726.06 → 8733.86] I would say that if an 11-year gap works for someone, then that's fine.
[8734.48 → 8735.32] It's huge.
[8735.62 → 8736.12] It's huge.
[8736.18 → 8736.78] I wouldn't do it.
[8737.64 → 8738.46] You do you.
[8738.58 → 8739.50] In either direction.
[8740.08 → 8740.64] That's a lot.
[8740.98 → 8741.78] You do you.
[8742.56 → 8747.02] When there's like a generational gap, I don't know.
[8747.66 → 8751.94] Moon Wish says, lol, Linus thinks 27 is a little old for a 38-year-old.
[8751.94 → 8755.74] I mean, it's a very different life stage.
[8755.74 → 8756.14] Fine.
[8756.22 → 8757.16] It's not like a...
[8757.16 → 8762.56] Like, I'm in the middle of my career, and I'm dating someone who is, like, getting close
[8762.56 → 8765.72] to the end of theirs, potentially, especially if they work in film.
[8766.22 → 8771.72] And so, like, we're just going to be at completely different life stages in a very short amount
[8771.72 → 8772.22] of time.
[8773.32 → 8774.98] That's a major concern for me.
[8775.08 → 8779.04] Like, I like that Yvonne and I, the other more different Yvonne, the one I actually married,
[8779.40 → 8782.54] are going to, like, age together, you know?
[8782.54 → 8789.36] Um, barring any kind of, you know, knock on wood, um, horrible, you know, health affliction
[8789.36 → 8795.56] or anything like that, uh, we're going to mostly fall apart at probably almost around
[8795.56 → 8796.86] the same tigerish, you know?
[8797.50 → 8799.64] Um, as soon as it all goes according to plan.
[8799.76 → 8800.98] It doesn't gross me out.
[8801.14 → 8802.38] I wouldn't do it.
[8802.38 → 8804.50] And it's going to be surprising to me.
[8804.78 → 8805.76] But, yeah, I don't know.
[8806.98 → 8812.76] I just think if you're going to be cool with going X amount of years down, you should also
[8812.76 → 8814.22] be cool with going X amount of years up.
[8815.68 → 8818.94] Yeah, I'm not saying it makes any kind of...
[8818.94 → 8821.70] But if you're not cool going X amount of years down, then, yeah, fair enough.
[8822.28 → 8829.34] I like that Yvonne and I are the same age, and I totally recognize that other things work
[8829.34 → 8831.06] for other people, and that's totally fine.
[8831.22 → 8831.52] Yeah, yeah.
[8831.92 → 8832.62] Totally fine.
[8833.38 → 8837.00] Okay, Mick 81, dating a 37-year-old.
[8837.28 → 8838.48] Are we talking about Mick Jagger?
[8839.84 → 8840.52] Hold on.
[8844.68 → 8846.58] I mean, that's not your girlfriend at that point.
[8846.58 → 8847.54] That's your...
[8847.54 → 8848.58] That's, like, your...
[8849.96 → 8851.32] Like, caretaker.
[8852.68 → 8855.10] Uh, Melanie Hayrick and Mick Jagger.
[8855.22 → 8856.62] 44-year age gap.
[8856.62 → 8861.62] So all I'm saying is he should be open to, uh, how old is he again?
[8864.68 → 8865.72] Too much.
[8866.14 → 8867.32] 81, was it said?
[8867.80 → 8868.74] Yeah, I think so.
[8868.86 → 8869.98] So, you know, 125-year-old.
[8869.98 → 8871.28] I don't think that's legal.
[8872.16 → 8876.94] I don't think you're allowed to do that, although he could probably afford to do what he wants.
[8877.52 → 8880.08] Bill Belichick is 70 and his girlfriend is 24.
[8880.08 → 8880.58] 24.
[8880.58 → 8890.46] All right, here we go.
[8894.12 → 8894.72] Okay.
[8895.14 → 8895.74] That's normal.
[8897.52 → 8903.18] Fans fear for him after her bizarre social media post.
[8903.18 → 8904.18] I mean...
[8905.18 → 8909.06] Yeah, that doesn't seem like a mismatch at all.
[8909.78 → 8910.12] You know?
[8910.12 → 8910.44] Yeah.
[8911.44 → 8912.12] Um...
[8913.90 → 8915.70] Is that the bizarre social media post?
[8915.72 → 8916.34] That's not bizarre.
[8916.58 → 8917.54] That's awesome.
[8917.72 → 8918.04] That's super normal.
[8918.20 → 8918.74] That looks great.
[8918.74 → 8919.24] That's adorable.
[8919.92 → 8921.46] That's cute, if anything.
[8922.50 → 8923.06] Um...
[8926.34 → 8926.86] Okay.
[8927.12 → 8927.80] Well, anyway.
[8928.36 → 8930.72] Someone said, surely he wasn't allowed to eat until she took the picture?
[8930.72 → 8931.66] Who cares?
[8931.96 → 8932.16] What?
[8932.32 → 8933.14] Who cares?
[8933.18 → 8934.14] That might even be true.
[8934.22 → 8935.30] He also is eating.
[8935.56 → 8939.36] He's, like, totally, like, starting on it while she takes a picture of her food.
[8939.48 → 8940.02] Calm down.
[8940.16 → 8940.94] Get off it.
[8941.40 → 8942.22] My goodness.
[8942.24 → 8943.04] Calm down.
[8944.36 → 8946.84] This is what happens when the cornucopia goes missing.
[8947.44 → 8948.54] The world just goes bad, dude.
[8948.54 → 8950.78] Everything is gone downhill, Zed.
[8950.96 → 8951.26] Yeah.
[8951.44 → 8952.44] They can't do this anymore.
[8952.68 → 8952.90] Yeah.
[8953.86 → 8954.18] All right.
[8954.74 → 8955.98] Hello, fellow humans.
[8955.98 → 8961.10] With the AMD Apus with great graphics performance, do you think GPUs will become less popular?
[8961.34 → 8961.90] Yes, they already have.
[8963.14 → 8964.48] Especially cheap GPUs.
[8964.56 → 8966.04] They basically don't exist anymore.
[8966.40 → 8966.68] Boom.
[8966.92 → 8967.82] It's AMD's fault.
[8971.98 → 8973.02] I accept this.
[8973.68 → 8974.46] This is true.
[8974.62 → 8974.92] NVIDIA.
[8975.02 → 8975.70] Slash S.
[8975.86 → 8976.46] Oh, my God.
[8976.66 → 8977.16] Slash S, please.
[8977.16 → 8978.34] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8978.40 → 8978.82] He said it.
[8978.86 → 8979.22] He said it.
[8979.24 → 8979.60] He said it.
[8980.34 → 8981.44] Go after him on Reddit.
[8982.18 → 8982.68] Make a thread.
[8982.68 → 8986.18] Just add it to the cheese one.
[8986.24 → 8986.96] I don't care anymore.
[8987.66 → 8988.64] Hi, LDD crew.
[8988.90 → 8994.46] Hey, now that Linus has now developed a few products, is he a fan of, quote unquote, design
[8994.46 → 8994.92] by committee?
[8995.48 → 9000.00] For example, Microsoft or a singular guiding vision, aka Steve Jobs?
[9000.14 → 9000.34] Nothing.
[9000.46 → 9000.66] Neither.
[9000.76 → 9001.38] They're both stupid.
[9002.34 → 9003.34] Wait, what?
[9003.34 → 9011.04] The correct answer is having a singular guiding vision and consulting a committee and taking
[9011.04 → 9015.20] the best ideas from your committee of people that presumably you surrounded yourself with
[9015.20 → 9021.26] because they're smart and then combining all of those, reaching a consensus about what
[9021.26 → 9026.96] the best product is to achieve the vision, which may have changed through discussion with
[9026.96 → 9031.22] the rest of the team, and then creating a product that is better than what any one of those
[9031.22 → 9037.00] people would have created, but not as directionless as what an entire team would have created.
[9037.40 → 9037.96] There you go.
[9038.10 → 9038.56] You're welcome.
[9039.90 → 9041.68] Someone disproved this.
[9043.42 → 9044.66] Way back machine.
[9044.82 → 9047.12] Fruit.com for the Loom logo.
[9047.94 → 9048.06] What?
[9048.18 → 9049.20] Fruit.com?
[9049.22 → 9050.76] Is their actual website just fruit.com?
[9050.76 → 9051.82] What is fruit.com?
[9052.96 → 9054.76] Yes, it is.
[9056.96 → 9060.60] It was archived on April Fool's.
[9060.72 → 9060.98] No!
[9061.92 → 9062.72] No way.
[9063.42 → 9068.94] So did the Fruit of the Loom company for April Fool's put up a logo with the cornucopia
[9068.94 → 9069.32] in it?
[9069.48 → 9069.96] Caught him.
[9072.02 → 9073.02] What a troll.
[9073.30 → 9074.88] That's actually an amazing troll.
[9075.70 → 9076.28] That's pretty good.
[9076.36 → 9077.42] That's actually fantastic.
[9078.00 → 9078.52] That's pretty good.
[9082.12 → 9082.78] All right.
[9082.78 → 9083.68] Well, you know what?
[9083.74 → 9085.16] It's been great hanging out with you all.
[9085.16 → 9087.52] I mean, doing a therapy session with you all.
[9087.80 → 9088.06] Yeah.
[9088.20 → 9089.36] We will see you again next week.
[9089.62 → 9090.82] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[9094.56 → 9095.50] How long can I...
[9095.50 → 9096.40] I can pause forever.
[9098.54 → 9099.84] You could be late for your thing.
[9100.74 → 9101.34] I'll just leave.
[9101.72 → 9102.04] Bye!
[9102.04 → 9102.72] I've done my part.
[9102.72 → 9102.84] Bye!
[9102.84 → 9104.20] Bye!
[9104.20 → 9104.88] Bye!
[9109.56 → 9110.06] I've seen such a good a month.
[9110.58 → 9110.60] Bye!
[9110.60 → 9110.64] Bye!
[9110.64 → 9111.10] Bye!
[9111.10 → 9111.28] Bye!
[9111.34 → 9111.62] Bye!
[9111.62 → 9112.12] Bye!
[9112.12 → 9112.78] Bye!
[9112.78 → 9113.76] Bye!
[9113.96 → 9114.86] Bye!
[9116.42 → 9117.46] Bye!
[9120.76 → 9121.46] Bye!
[9128.70 → 9129.36] Bye!
[9129.36 → 9129.60] Bye!
[9129.64 → 9129.70] Bye!
[9129.78 → 9129.84] Bye!
[9129.84 → 9130.60] Bye!
[9130.60 → 9131.14] Bye!
[9131.14 → 9132.10] Bye!
[9132.10 → 9132.46] Bye!
