[0.00 --> 7.02]  and pleased to announce that the U.S. government appears to be amenable to freedom cities,
[7.36 --> 10.96]  corporate-run cities with laxer laws.
[10.96 --> 15.38]  And you guys have heard us talk before about Linustown.
[15.82 --> 19.86]  This might be just the opportunity to get it started up.
[20.20 --> 23.94]  And Luke, Luke, you're going to be the first resident, right?
[24.24 --> 25.42]  Of course, of course, of course.
[26.30 --> 27.14]  Heck yeah!
[27.14 --> 36.88]  In other news, MSI has announced yet another variation of the RTX 5070 that you can't buy,
[36.88 --> 43.32]  bringing their total to 19 different RTX 5070s you can't buy.
[43.42 --> 48.84]  So we're going to be talking a little bit about what exactly it is that inspires board makers
[48.84 --> 54.32]  to continue releasing more models that rely on a supply-constrained part.
[55.44 --> 55.88]  Yeah.
[55.88 --> 56.60]  What?
[57.60 --> 59.14]  What else we got this week?
[59.46 --> 64.42]  Pokemon Go has been sold to the Saudi Arabia's public investment fund,
[64.66 --> 68.28]  and Microsoft teases co-pilot for gaming,
[68.52 --> 72.76]  which is, like, probably the last thing I wanted to hear about from AI.
[73.92 --> 74.48]  Cool.
[74.60 --> 75.00]  Nice!
[75.00 --> 79.20]  I can't roll the intro, so, uh, Luke.
[80.12 --> 80.48]  Oh.
[80.48 --> 80.52]  Ugh.
[80.52 --> 80.58]  Ugh.
[80.58 --> 80.64]  Ugh.
[80.64 --> 80.68]  Ugh.
[81.78 --> 82.14]  Ugh.
[86.14 --> 103.50]  The show is brought to you today by server part deals.
[103.50 --> 104.82]  Delete Me.
[104.82 --> 106.42]  And Odoo.
[106.42 --> 111.60]  Of course, with some help from our wrap partner, Dbrand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair
[111.60 --> 117.02]  partner, Secret Lab, whose chair I am, oh, yeah, really enjoying right now for sure.
[117.02 --> 119.72]  Definitely sitting in a Secret Lab chair, 100%.
[119.72 --> 120.18]  Yeah.
[120.18 --> 123.04]  Uh, what do we want to get into first here?
[123.34 --> 128.58]  Uh, whoever prepared this, uh, Freedom Cities topic, boy, did they ever put in the work.
[128.58 --> 138.16]  And that's probably a good thing, because it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a prickly topic, um, and certainly a little polarizing.
[138.16 --> 142.78]  So why don't we just go through the notes, and then we can talk about Freedom Cities.
[142.94 --> 143.58]  Sound pretty good?
[143.76 --> 144.62]  Sound pretty good.
[144.98 --> 145.12]  Yeah.
[145.38 --> 153.34]  Lobby groups in the United States, representing startup nations, are drafting congressional legislation
[153.34 --> 156.84]  that is aimed at creating what they call Freedom Cities.
[156.84 --> 156.96]  Freedom Cities.
[158.04 --> 158.44]  Okay.
[158.80 --> 160.16]  We're going off script already.
[160.94 --> 162.98]  Isn't this just company towns?
[164.12 --> 165.02]  Yeah, isn't it?
[165.66 --> 166.66]  That's immediately what I thought.
[167.50 --> 169.14]  I haven't dove into this enough.
[169.22 --> 175.74]  I actually got really excited when I saw all these notes, because again, whoever did this, like, great, because I haven't done the time to research this properly.
[176.10 --> 177.62]  Uh, but I'm happy that somebody did.
[177.94 --> 182.34]  But yeah, immediately, company towns, I saw comments on it that were immediately calling out company towns.
[182.52 --> 184.54]  Those were a massive failure in America.
[184.54 --> 190.28]  So, like, if my, if these notes don't have, what is it?
[190.32 --> 192.34]  Uh, owe my soul to the company store.
[192.50 --> 196.50]  If that's not in here, then that is a, that's a major swing and a miss.
[196.78 --> 196.92]  Yeah.
[197.10 --> 205.00]  Um, for those of you who are not familiar with the history, company towns were, well, pretty much this.
[205.04 --> 212.82]  They were areas with looser regulation, um, pretty much nothing in terms of, uh, workers' rights.
[212.82 --> 224.48]  And one of the biggest grifts or biggest scams in company towns was that they would pay you with credits that could only be used at the company store.
[224.48 --> 232.58]  Some even went as far as to only allow the person who was issued the credits to spend them.
[232.68 --> 239.00]  So they couldn't even be traded to someone outside of the company to use it in the company store.
[239.00 --> 241.94]  It was only usable by you.
[242.04 --> 249.62]  And then because, you know, the company town, um, controls who's allowed to have a store in it, only they were allowed to have the store.
[249.70 --> 257.14]  They jacked up the price and essentially put you in a position where you were completely at their mercy and couldn't save any money.
[257.14 --> 260.48]  Um, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[260.52 --> 261.04]  I'm coming back.
[261.08 --> 262.26]  I'm coming back to the notes here.
[262.66 --> 266.80]  So they imagine that these freedom cities.
[267.30 --> 267.56]  Okay.
[267.58 --> 268.84]  So that's how we're going to distinguish.
[268.84 --> 273.38]  When we're talking about the historical side of it, we're going to talk about company towns.
[273.38 --> 278.14]  And when we talk about the current version, we're going to call them freedom cities.
[278.14 --> 285.36]  And I use my air quotes here, uh, extremely, um, air quotey.
[285.82 --> 286.52]  Um, okay.
[287.18 --> 295.44]  So these freedom cities should be free of certain restrictive federal regulations that impede innovation.
[295.86 --> 301.78]  They will be governed by corporations and in some instances should pay less in tax.
[301.78 --> 329.20]  According to one of the groups that is lobbying for these, um, named the freedom cities coalition, freedom cities are a once in a generation opportunity to solve the housing crisis, bring American manufacturing home and unleash the full potential of American entrepreneurs through the creation of special districts called prosperity zones.
[329.20 --> 331.20]  Seriously.
[331.20 --> 334.60]  Uh, this is like, sorry, we're going off script again.
[334.76 --> 338.20]  This is like, this is like straight out of fricking bioshock.
[339.10 --> 351.70]  You know, like this is, this has literally existed many times in literature and exists in literature because it has existed many times in reality.
[351.70 --> 353.24]  And we all know how it ends.
[353.24 --> 353.96]  Yeah.
[354.22 --> 360.58]  So it's like, it's, it's like relatable to write fiction about because it's not that fiction.
[361.58 --> 376.92]  Oh, according to wired, the goal of these cities is ostensibly to create safe havens for anti-aging clinical trials, nuclear power startups, manufacturing hubs, and shipbuilding ports.
[376.92 --> 390.52]  Um, and basically, um, avoid scrutiny from agencies like the food and drug administration, nuclear regulatory commission, and environmental protection agency.
[391.66 --> 394.00]  Nuclear regulatory commission, man.
[394.08 --> 400.10]  So they want to, they want to do unregulated drug testing is basically like the main thing that I'm reading from this.
[400.10 --> 403.40]  We want to experiment on humans and we don't want to get in trouble for it.
[404.58 --> 404.98]  Yeah.
[405.12 --> 409.92]  And don't forget that they want to experiment on nuclear reactors and don't want anybody looking at it.
[410.20 --> 410.38]  Nice.
[410.62 --> 415.76]  And don't forget that they want to do whatever they want to the environment, um, and not have anybody look at it.
[415.92 --> 416.18]  Yeah.
[416.34 --> 423.22]  See, that's the, that's the thing about like the environment is that, you know, it's the environment.
[424.12 --> 426.54]  Like it affects, you know, everyone around you.
[426.54 --> 433.08]  You see that, you see that wild thing where, uh, what's their nuts, um, like blocked a river from running into a rock.
[434.04 --> 443.70]  Like if you, if you nuclear something or you, you know, extinct a species or whatever that actually impacts everyone.
[445.22 --> 448.76]  So yeah, that's, that's why you have it everywhere.
[449.56 --> 451.36]  Um, cool.
[451.36 --> 469.68]  Anyway, Trey Goff, the chief of staff of the startup nation slash freedom city Prospera, man, that is such a, like, honestly, I don't think I could come up with a more dystopian sounding name for a company town.
[469.68 --> 473.88]  Why does it, because I completely agree, but why does it sound so dystopian?
[473.88 --> 483.44]  Is it, is it like 1950s, like American dream, like Bioshock stuff?
[483.58 --> 484.78]  Like, is, is it Bioshock?
[484.82 --> 485.92]  Are we thinking Bioshock?
[487.08 --> 490.62]  Oh, well, well, Bioshock was already like super derivative.
[490.62 --> 496.28]  So it's just the most modern gamer culture example that I could think of.
[497.50 --> 499.94]  1950s fascist romanticism said war.
[499.94 --> 504.96]  No, I think Nate, Nate, Niteohan in float plane chat nailed, nailed it.
[505.00 --> 509.78]  It sounds propagandistic, propagandist, propagandist, whatever.
[509.94 --> 510.68]  It sounds like propaganda.
[511.58 --> 513.24]  And yeah, that's exactly it.
[513.56 --> 522.72]  It immediately gives me the ick because if something causes prosperity, you don't have to call it that.
[522.72 --> 536.94]  You know, the, the, the New York stock exchange isn't called the New York prosperity exchange because by calling it a stock exchange, you acknowledge that it doesn't just go up.
[536.94 --> 537.38]  Yeah.
[537.38 --> 545.30]  You know, whereas Prospera, it just makes it sound like everyone prospers.
[545.44 --> 560.40]  I mean, I think it's, well, we could talk about it in a little more detail later, but I pretty much promise you that the people who are being subject to these, you know, human drug trials are not the ones that are going to be prospering from all of this.
[560.40 --> 587.52]  They may, they may make some financial gains, but the irony of seeing the, the groups that are the proponents of this and the groups that are sort of generally against things like vaccinations being the same people is sort of funny to me, I guess.
[587.52 --> 590.58]  I don't know. Good luck, everybody.
[591.42 --> 594.58]  Um, what else we got going on here?
[595.26 --> 597.26]  Um, so anyway, Trey Goff.
[597.44 --> 600.54]  Joe, Josie, Josie, hopefully I'm saying that right.
[600.98 --> 603.52]  Uh, Mayday in full plane chat said China has them.
[603.64 --> 610.94]  They're called special economic zones and have contributed significantly to Chinese dominance in manufacturing, which to me.
[610.98 --> 615.52]  Well, yeah, that's just another way of saying that you can have forced labor there.
[615.52 --> 615.92]  Yeah.
[615.92 --> 616.18]  Yeah.
[617.38 --> 623.00]  Forced labor is a really good, really good way to dominate manufacturing.
[623.32 --> 623.66]  That's true.
[624.04 --> 624.68]  Very effective.
[625.82 --> 626.66]  It's, um.
[626.70 --> 627.80]  High amount of effectiveness.
[628.82 --> 644.92]  Yeah, it's effective, but it's the kind of thing that as someone who might end up living in a, in Prospera at some point or in a, in a prosperity city or freedom city or whatever, um, you shouldn't be voting for this if you are not in the billionaire class.
[644.92 --> 645.92]  Like 100%.
[645.92 --> 646.00]  Um, okay.
[646.00 --> 646.20]  Okay.
[646.20 --> 647.20]  Okay.
[647.20 --> 665.20]  So anyway, Trey Goff, chief of staff of the startup nation slash freedom city Prospera says that he and others from his company working under a lobbying group called the freedom cities coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration about the idea recently.
[665.20 --> 669.94]  And says that the administration has been very receptive.
[669.94 --> 679.66]  Prospera hopes to create as many of these zones as the market can handle and hope to have drafted legislation ready by the end of the year.
[679.66 --> 681.66]  Now, here's the thing though.
[681.66 --> 685.66]  Prospera is not like coming out of nowhere here.
[685.66 --> 688.66]  They actually have a freedom city already.
[688.66 --> 692.66]  Prospera opened on the Honduran Island of Roatan.
[692.66 --> 694.66]  Pardon me if I said the name wrong, but whatever.
[694.66 --> 695.66]  It doesn't change the facts.
[695.66 --> 696.66]  Whatever.
[696.66 --> 697.66]  It doesn't change the facts.
[697.66 --> 698.66]  In 2020.
[698.66 --> 712.66]  They have attracted tech workers and startups with the promise of lower taxes, fewer regulations, and, um, it just says a governing body, but I don't, I think the notes might've cut off there anyway.
[712.66 --> 715.66]  But the main points are lower taxes and fewer regulations.
[715.66 --> 716.66]  Ah, yes.
[716.66 --> 729.66]  And a corporate governing body startup nations or freedom cities like this outside the U S have relied on the creation of special economic zones where standard business regulations are waived in order to attract foreign investment.
[729.66 --> 741.66]  Notably, the current Honduran government considers Prospera's special economic status to be illegal, despite the previous president giving them a permanent charter to offer.
[741.66 --> 743.66]  Operate on their own terms.
[743.66 --> 744.66]  Operate on their own terms.
[744.66 --> 745.66]  Operate on their own terms.
[745.66 --> 752.66]  Many Honduran citizens opposed Prospera, arguing that it increased poverty and worsened biodiversity in the area.
[752.66 --> 767.66]  And in 2022, Honduran Congress repealed the law that allowed for the creation of these special economic zones and in future to abolish existing special economic zones, classifying the law as a violation of national sovereignty.
[767.66 --> 774.66]  Operate on their own terms, the Honduran government is currently being sued for $11 billion by Prospera over this reversal of their policy.
[774.66 --> 776.66]  Oh man.
[776.66 --> 795.66]  Um, the freedom cities coalition was created by Niwe capital LLC, which owns several trademarks for Prospera and is in part financed by, uh, PRNOMOS capital, a VC firm backed by former PayPal CEO, Peter Thiel.
[795.66 --> 799.66]  Um, Mark Andreessen and Coinbase.
[799.66 --> 800.66]  Yep.
[800.66 --> 801.66]  Makes sense.
[801.66 --> 810.66]  There are other groups that are lobbying for freedom cities in the U S including the Frontier Foundation and the Charter Cities Institute.
[810.66 --> 825.66]  Um, and Wired obtained a memo from 2025 in which the Frontier Foundation argues that domestic innovation and production has been significantly impeded for decades by outdated and unnecessarily restrictive federal regulation.
[825.66 --> 829.66]  Some of these groups are pushing to use federal land to build these cities.
[829.66 --> 838.66]  So they basically want the federal government to give them, um, like, I guess in Canada we call it crown land.
[838.66 --> 841.66]  Um, so yeah, federal government land.
[841.66 --> 844.66]  Um, or maybe they want to buy it?
[844.66 --> 846.66]  Oh man.
[846.66 --> 849.66]  This is, this is wild.
[849.66 --> 862.66]  Um, companies are already taking advantage of startup nations like mini circle, a biotech company that focuses on gene therapy treatments designed to extend human lifespans.
[862.66 --> 875.66]  Um, they have an office in Prospera and co-founder Mac Davis says their recent gene therapy clinical trial on the protein fall a statin, uh, which he claims increases muscle mass without side effects and has life extending benefits.
[875.66 --> 878.66]  And mice was only possible in Prospera.
[878.66 --> 879.66]  Yeah.
[879.66 --> 888.66]  Uh, Davis added that he could imagine other companies benefiting from freedom cities like SpaceX, which has been working on incorporating its own city around their Texas starship factory in Spaceport.
[888.66 --> 893.66]  Oh, opinion.
[893.66 --> 894.66]  This is hilarious.
[894.66 --> 900.66]  Uh, it is unlikely that deregulation will benefit anyone outside of freedom cities, wealthy backers.
[900.66 --> 910.66]  Oh, Gil Duren, former political consultant and author of Substack newsletter, Nerd Reich claims these are going to be cities without democracy.
[910.66 --> 912.66]  These are going to be cities without workers rights.
[912.66 --> 918.66]  These are going to be cities where the owners of the city, the corporations, the billionaires have all the power and everyone else has no power.
[918.66 --> 925.66]  That is what's so attractive about these sovereign entities to these people is that they will actually be anti-freedom cities.
[925.66 --> 930.66]  So it's time for us to, um, talk about this.
[930.66 --> 931.66]  Um, talk about this.
[931.66 --> 932.66]  It's hilarious.
[932.66 --> 933.66]  Yeah.
[933.66 --> 949.66]  That we can make these kinds of arguments and that anyone takes them seriously when history has shown so clearly and so obviously and so repeatedly that it's a terrible, terrible idea.
[949.66 --> 962.66]  And basically works out to be feudalism without any of the good things about feudalism, like the copious amounts of vacation time.
[962.66 --> 965.66]  Yeah, I don't really have a lot to say.
[965.66 --> 978.66]  I know, um, a long time ago, uh, and we even got an approach for it at one point, but, um, I think it was Sweden was doing like a startup city thing where they had, they had an old military.
[978.66 --> 979.66]  I might get some of this wrong.
[979.66 --> 980.66]  I might get a decent amount of this wrong.
[980.66 --> 981.66]  It's just been too long.
[981.66 --> 984.66]  If I remember correctly, they had an old military base.
[984.66 --> 991.66]  Um, so they had decent power and decent networking and some of the old barracks and stuff like that.
[991.66 --> 997.66]  Um, but like, not like barracks, like basically an extended tent with bunks like barracks.
[997.66 --> 1001.66]  It was like an apartment building effectively.
[1001.66 --> 1002.66]  Yeah.
[1002.66 --> 1008.66]  And they just, they, they retrofitted it, did a bunch of renovations and stuff and basically turned it into a town.
[1008.66 --> 1011.66]  Um, and they were like, well, it's got fantastic internet.
[1011.66 --> 1013.66]  It's got fantastic power and we turned it into a town.
[1013.66 --> 1015.66]  So we're, we want to populate this area.
[1015.66 --> 1020.66]  So we're going to make it like a startup town and we'll give funding to startup companies.
[1020.66 --> 1022.66]  And we'll make the housing really cheap and stuff.
[1022.66 --> 1031.66]  And we'll like basically seed the population here by making it really good for business by giving them tax breaks, making it easy for people to move here.
[1031.66 --> 1037.66]  So if you want to start up, well, your people that you're probably paying through stock or whatever can get relatively cheap housing.
[1037.66 --> 1040.66]  You have good internet, there's good business support, stuff like that.
[1040.66 --> 1048.66]  And as far as what we're saying goes, it like worked and they're able to effectively set up a new city and, you know, natural infrastructure shows up around that.
[1048.66 --> 1053.66]  If you have a few, if you have a few thousand people in an area, a little restaurant will pop up there or whatever else will start happening.
[1053.66 --> 1054.66]  And then it just grew over time.
[1054.66 --> 1055.66]  Yeah, for sure.
[1055.66 --> 1060.66]  So there are ways to sort of do some of the benefits that you're looking for from this.
[1060.66 --> 1066.66]  Um, but you know, not the complete deregulation stuff.
[1066.66 --> 1074.66]  Um, it's just wild to me that they're being so transparent about what it is that they want.
[1074.66 --> 1080.66]  And that we're not kind of going, whoa, red flag, red flag, red flag.
[1080.66 --> 1085.66]  It's like, yeah, we want to do, we want to do human drug trials without any regulatory scrutiny.
[1085.66 --> 1093.66]  Like, yeah, but like, that's the part that you, you know, that's the part that you gotcha later.
[1093.66 --> 1103.66]  That's the, that's the part that you, you know, uh, that's the, the fog boiling, you know, you don't say upfront, like, yeah, we want to do human drug trials without anyone paying.
[1103.66 --> 1126.66]  So I am going to, I am going to say something that is, I want to make very clear is me playing devil's advocate here because, because I do not believe that the complete removal of regulations that are designed to keep everyday citizens safe is a good idea.
[1126.66 --> 1138.66]  So I think that's an experiment that we've, um, I think that's an experiment that we've run enough times to know that we don't need to run this experiment again.
[1138.66 --> 1141.66]  But here's what I will say.
[1141.66 --> 1154.40]  You made an argument a little while back with regards to AI, where you basically said, okay, well, from the, yo, look at the look on his face.
[1154.46 --> 1157.00]  I think he knows where I'm going, but he's not going to cut me off for a change.
[1157.00 --> 1167.14]  You made an argument about AI recently where you were like, well, okay, the horse is out of the stable.
[1168.14 --> 1175.96]  You know, every other country that has no copyright is going to train their AIs on copyrighted materials.
[1175.96 --> 1180.76]  So we either just say, okay, screw it.
[1180.76 --> 1183.20]  We don't worry about copyrighted materials.
[1183.20 --> 1188.36]  Goodbye laws, or we lose, we lose the AI race.
[1189.10 --> 1192.26]  And here, here is what I will say.
[1193.02 --> 1200.10]  Is that not fundamentally the exact same argument that these guys are making?
[1200.10 --> 1203.50]  We are losing in manufacturing.
[1203.98 --> 1207.94]  We are losing in drug development.
[1208.58 --> 1215.06]  We are losing in private sector nuclear innovation.
[1216.06 --> 1220.76]  We just need to YOLO the same way that our competitors are YOLOing.
[1220.90 --> 1224.92]  Because you know that in the Middle East, they're going to YOLO.
[1225.30 --> 1227.02]  You know China's going to YOLO.
[1227.02 --> 1232.14]  That appears to be their argument.
[1232.78 --> 1241.62]  And if we draw the parallel to your AI argument, where we basically go, yeah, our laws that are, in many cases, good laws,
[1241.82 --> 1247.70]  meant to protect people, meant to protect whether it's rights holders, in the case of copyright,
[1247.98 --> 1252.02]  from having their works used to train AIs that will ultimately steal their jobs,
[1252.02 --> 1258.78]  or whether it's to protect people from, you know, turning into nightmare science experiments,
[1258.78 --> 1261.40]  because of unregulated drug testing or whatever.
[1263.12 --> 1267.34]  Are these laws going to hold back America?
[1267.34 --> 1278.14]  I'm sure in some ways they will, but I also think deregulating nuclear might hold back America pretty dramatically as well.
[1278.84 --> 1284.04]  As much as breaking copyright is like horrible for lots of people,
[1284.04 --> 1292.68]  I think the impact of just allowing slave labor in the States, if that's what making manufacturing better is,
[1292.88 --> 1307.36]  or deregulating nuclear, has much more negative potential impact than the admittedly really brutal impact of just everyone's copyright being effectively meaningless moving forward.
[1307.36 --> 1311.26]  But yeah, I don't know. It's an interesting one.
[1311.34 --> 1318.14]  I feel like they are trying to be blatant about what they're trying to do,
[1318.40 --> 1325.22]  so that when somebody goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, and tries to turn this around after they've already been established,
[1325.22 --> 1327.16]  they can sue the crap out of the country.
[1327.28 --> 1330.02]  That feels like the reason for them being blatant to me.
[1330.12 --> 1331.56]  I could be wrong, but I'm not sure.
[1331.78 --> 1332.40]  You could be right.
[1332.40 --> 1336.68]  They have much more ground to stand on if they were very clear about their intentions the entire time.
[1337.36 --> 1347.74]  Also, I think they're really pushing the manufacturing thing in order to appeal to the current administration
[1347.74 --> 1351.18]  who has been talking about bringing manufacturing back to the States.
[1352.00 --> 1358.82]  But I suspect due to how quickly they shifted off of manufacturing and started going,
[1359.34 --> 1362.62]  yeah, but all this other cool stuff would happen too,
[1362.62 --> 1368.42]  that really the focus would be on unregulated testing.
[1369.00 --> 1374.50]  So drug testing on humans, nuclear development, stuff like that.
[1375.10 --> 1378.14]  And I think there's, I don't know.
[1378.28 --> 1380.36]  I don't know enough about those arenas.
[1380.62 --> 1382.56]  I know more about the AI stuff.
[1382.56 --> 1389.32]  So I feel like saying anything there would be a problem because I don't know enough about it.
[1389.36 --> 1395.20]  But I'm not like certain that we are or we, that Americans are falling behind in that regard.
[1395.30 --> 1400.96]  Like I think American pharmaceutical companies are still running most things.
[1401.12 --> 1404.88]  There's the weight loss stuff that as far as my understanding goes,
[1404.94 --> 1406.28]  they're not doing the best at right now.
[1406.28 --> 1411.14]  I think the Dutch or something have the fancy one that everybody likes.
[1411.42 --> 1412.78]  I don't remember the name of it.
[1414.56 --> 1414.96]  Whatever.
[1415.26 --> 1420.66]  But the Dutch is still pretty the West in terms of like clinical trial regulations.
[1421.16 --> 1421.84]  That's the one.
[1421.98 --> 1422.44]  Is that Sweden?
[1422.58 --> 1422.96]  I don't know.
[1423.12 --> 1426.22]  I don't know much about it, but I know that one's like not American or something.
[1427.68 --> 1431.12]  So, okay, maybe they lost that race, but like they seem to win most
[1431.12 --> 1432.84]  when it comes to pharmaceutical stuff.
[1432.90 --> 1434.82]  So I don't know that that's necessarily happening.
[1434.82 --> 1440.44]  Um, and then nuclear, like, I don't know.
[1440.52 --> 1442.32]  I don't feel like you need to deregulate it.
[1442.34 --> 1446.86]  Like I, I, I don't know that America is necessarily leading nuclear,
[1446.86 --> 1449.80]  but like you almost never hear America talk about nuclear.
[1449.94 --> 1454.44]  So maybe you should like care about it more and then you do fine.
[1454.60 --> 1455.00]  Probably.
[1455.54 --> 1461.68]  Um, dude, I think that the, the main issue is that not Dutch.
[1461.74 --> 1462.32]  I don't know, dude.
[1462.32 --> 1463.20]  I said, I didn't know.
[1463.28 --> 1463.68]  Leave me alone.
[1463.80 --> 1464.62]  I don't know who it is.
[1464.62 --> 1465.80]  I don't care about a Zepic.
[1466.34 --> 1466.70]  Whatever.
[1466.82 --> 1467.26]  Anyway, sorry.
[1467.26 --> 1470.84]  The main issue is that it's, uh, there, there's no real alignment, right?
[1471.34 --> 1474.88]  Like, uh, the, on the one hand, it's like, yeah, more cool.
[1475.02 --> 1477.36]  Let's bring, bring back coal, make it great.
[1477.70 --> 1481.22]  Um, and then on the other hand, it's like, yeah, but there's too much regulatory
[1481.22 --> 1482.78]  crap around nuclear.
[1482.88 --> 1486.20]  It's like, what is the nuclear?
[1486.30 --> 1488.86]  I thought you wanted, I thought you wanted more clean coal.
[1488.86 --> 1490.92]  Like what, what are we, what are we doing here?
[1491.00 --> 1491.38]  Exactly.
[1491.54 --> 1495.92]  I, I, it seems a little unfocused, um, to put it mildly.
[1496.82 --> 1497.86]  Um, yeah.
[1497.88 --> 1504.74]  And this thing is, is much, it's, it's like a, it's a crazy, but like I would feel okay.
[1504.74 --> 1506.84]  To be clear, I'm not saying I would feel comfortable.
[1506.84 --> 1512.48]  I'm saying I would feel more comfortable if it was, if they were specific, I think.
[1513.74 --> 1515.96]  And like one at a time was approved.
[1516.32 --> 1521.56]  If they were like, you know, we're going to pick this one area way out in the desert,
[1521.56 --> 1528.38]  like we have before, um, where we're going to do maybe not, not regulated, but less regulated
[1528.38 --> 1532.44]  nuclear testing or something like that, or maybe it's not less regulated, but they have
[1532.44 --> 1537.46]  people from the nuclear, whatever thing like on site all the time.
[1538.40 --> 1538.88]  Yeah.
[1538.94 --> 1539.42]  Fast tracking.
[1539.76 --> 1540.12]  Yes.
[1540.20 --> 1545.62]  So they can fast track stuff, fast track approvals, do whatever, like have a like rapid development
[1545.62 --> 1550.12]  zone basically, um, where it's like an area that is made for that.
[1550.12 --> 1554.34]  And you have government officials like on site that are able to look at things and approve
[1554.34 --> 1558.14]  things more quickly and keep, keep the wheels of progress moving like that.
[1558.24 --> 1562.72]  That sounds like interesting to me, but just a blanket, like, yeah, we're going to build
[1562.72 --> 1564.62]  as many of these cities as we possibly can.
[1564.62 --> 1565.26]  And who knows?
[1565.30 --> 1569.34]  I don't know, maybe company store, maybe slave labor, maybe drug practices, maybe nuclear stuff.
[1569.34 --> 1570.48]  I don't know like that.
[1570.58 --> 1574.12]  That's just, it's too, um, it's too wild to me.
[1574.12 --> 1577.40]  I think there's ways to accomplish the goal here.
[1577.76 --> 1582.16]  Um, that isn't just giving people the blanket ability to not have laws.
[1582.44 --> 1583.82]  Um, I don't know.
[1583.82 --> 1592.50]  And like, I want to make this very clear that from a business owner standpoint, I find the,
[1592.50 --> 1601.52]  um, land zoning and building code and regulatory hurdles that we have in place here.
[1601.98 --> 1603.48]  Um, very stifling.
[1603.64 --> 1604.06]  Yep.
[1604.94 --> 1605.90]  And I'm sure they are.
[1606.02 --> 1610.72]  And I'm honestly, I, I doubt they're as stifling, but I'm sure they're also very, very annoying
[1610.72 --> 1611.68]  to deal with in the States.
[1612.44 --> 1612.84]  Yep.
[1612.84 --> 1614.46]  And so here, I'll give an example.
[1614.98 --> 1617.56]  Um, in the, in the badminton center.
[1617.76 --> 1618.18]  Okay.
[1618.18 --> 1622.44]  If you guys remember any of the tours that we've done, there's a wall down the middle
[1622.44 --> 1623.64]  between the two halves.
[1624.22 --> 1624.48]  Okay.
[1624.48 --> 1628.16]  So one half is going to be always badminton all the time.
[1628.30 --> 1633.94]  The other half is wired up for land parties, like, uh, e-sports gaming events, that sort
[1633.94 --> 1634.24]  of thing.
[1634.24 --> 1636.16]  So it's got all the power and networking and everything.
[1636.90 --> 1641.84]  We have four doors in between the two sides because under normal circumstances, people
[1641.84 --> 1646.82]  need to be able to cross over if their group is, you know, split across courts on two sides,
[1646.82 --> 1651.34]  or if we have a tournament or something that's using the whole facility and someone has their
[1651.34 --> 1652.26]  bag, like over here.
[1652.26 --> 1655.82]  We don't want them to have to hike all the way around to the one door to get to the other
[1655.82 --> 1656.10]  side.
[1656.10 --> 1662.12]  So at our expense, we put a bunch of doors in that wall so people can cross through.
[1663.12 --> 1671.50]  Again, at our expense, we put access control on all of those doors, like Unify, um, scanners,
[1671.50 --> 1677.16]  so that if you have a wristband or something, you can boop yourself in, uh, to, uh, to an,
[1677.16 --> 1681.38]  uh, unauthorized area, whether it's the gym upstairs or whether it's the other side of
[1681.38 --> 1682.14]  the courts or whatever.
[1682.26 --> 1683.58]  So we've got these scanners everywhere.
[1683.58 --> 1685.14]  All right.
[1685.14 --> 1694.08]  As part of our temporary use permit approval to use this building for e-sports and LAN gaming
[1694.08 --> 1706.32]  events, um, we had to have an engineer relook at our fire egress safety evacuation plan.
[1706.86 --> 1711.82]  And they basically came to us and they said, Hey, all those doors down the middle, they need
[1711.82 --> 1712.72]  push bars now.
[1713.58 --> 1716.28]  And we kind of went, sorry, what?
[1717.78 --> 1724.02]  They need push bars because they need people on the one side, the badminton side need to be
[1724.02 --> 1729.22]  able to access this, this man door that's halfway down the side of the building on the land side,
[1729.22 --> 1731.14]  because you're going to have more people in there.
[1731.14 --> 1737.38]  And I'm like, brother, all the additional people are going to be on the land side.
[1737.38 --> 1742.12]  And they're like, yeah, but it's a, it's a regulatory thing from any point.
[1742.12 --> 1746.92]  It has to be no more than X number of meters to the nearest exit.
[1747.08 --> 1751.78]  And there's like these, this place right here needs to go out that way.
[1751.78 --> 1757.92]  And I'm like, my brother in Christ, these were two separate units.
[1757.92 --> 1762.70]  I put these doors here and they're like, yeah, but you're going to have more people there.
[1762.70 --> 1767.72]  And I'm like, my brother in Christ, the people will not be on that side.
[1768.16 --> 1770.72]  They will be on the side that has the door.
[1771.80 --> 1773.96]  Is there anything we can do about this?
[1773.96 --> 1780.42]  And they go, well, there is, you know, the original door for this unit at the front of the building,
[1780.42 --> 1784.44]  but you guys put this half wall in place.
[1784.50 --> 1786.08]  So now it's not a direct path.
[1787.20 --> 1789.24]  And I'm going, okay.
[1789.72 --> 1798.98]  So just so I understand this correctly, because to get out, I would have to go this much to the side
[1798.98 --> 1803.30]  to get around this little half wall and then walk around it.
[1804.46 --> 1806.14]  I can't lock the doors.
[1806.62 --> 1807.10]  Yes.
[1807.50 --> 1811.74]  I can't lock the doors between my LAN event and badminton.
[1811.74 --> 1819.14]  That is a major like security issue because we can't have like randoms going into a LAN event.
[1819.28 --> 1820.62]  You have to have the doors locked.
[1822.18 --> 1826.98]  So the point is we are working on it,
[1826.98 --> 1835.72]  but this is the kind of arbitrary bull crap that you deal with when you have overregulation.
[1837.72 --> 1840.42]  And that's 10 of zero.
[1840.56 --> 1842.30]  It wasn't a direct path in the first place anyway.
[1842.46 --> 1843.70]  Don't overthink it.
[1844.28 --> 1845.00]  Trust me.
[1845.18 --> 1848.54]  The story is as stupid as I am making it sound.
[1849.58 --> 1851.68]  Like, okay, Luke, here's another good one.
[1851.68 --> 1855.76]  Do you remember when we built the mezzanine in Unit 101,
[1856.20 --> 1859.24]  where the lounge and the tech-linked green screen set are?
[1860.60 --> 1860.86]  Yeah.
[1861.52 --> 1862.14]  Okay.
[1862.74 --> 1865.88]  You know how there's two stairwells up to that?
[1865.88 --> 1876.12]  That's because the building code in Surrey at that time required two stairwells up to every mezzanine.
[1876.72 --> 1877.20]  Oh, yeah.
[1877.26 --> 1882.50]  That building code only existed for like a few years before everyone kind of went,
[1882.66 --> 1884.18]  oh, yeah, this is really stupid.
[1884.30 --> 1885.82]  This is like ridiculous.
[1885.82 --> 1897.32]  Because you are using a ton of floor space and a ton of the upper floor space for these multiple landings
[1897.32 --> 1901.88]  for like a tiny little like 1,500 square foot mezzanine.
[1904.96 --> 1905.48]  Yes.
[1905.62 --> 1906.54]  Oh, my God.
[1906.58 --> 1908.68]  I know that fire egress is no joke.
[1908.76 --> 1911.54]  For the love of God, guys, calm down.
[1911.54 --> 1913.24]  There's a man door at the back.
[1913.36 --> 1914.94]  There's a man door at the front.
[1915.16 --> 1917.24]  And we've got to use some common sense.
[1917.56 --> 1919.62]  It is an empty box.
[1920.44 --> 1922.62]  There is nothing to burn.
[1923.18 --> 1924.88]  It's a badminton center.
[1926.78 --> 1930.12]  We are not using common sense here.
[1930.84 --> 1932.68]  It's not a difficult building to get out of.
[1933.66 --> 1937.12]  If it was a warehouse with racking to the ceiling,
[1937.12 --> 1942.52]  and it was a fabric warehouse, okay?
[1943.24 --> 1943.80]  Sure.
[1945.08 --> 1946.56]  Let's talk about it.
[1947.66 --> 1951.88]  But, guys, it is an empty building.
[1952.70 --> 1956.16]  It will have at maximum like 40 people in it.
[1956.38 --> 1958.86]  And there's an emergency exit door at the one end
[1958.86 --> 1961.08]  and an emergency exit door at the other end.
[1961.20 --> 1964.46]  And you literally have to step around as much as I just showed you.
[1964.46 --> 1966.86]  It's a big tunnel, effectively.
[1967.16 --> 1968.32]  Guys, calm down.
[1968.48 --> 1969.22]  An empty box.
[1973.02 --> 1975.80]  But what if it's filled with poison gas or something?
[1976.80 --> 1978.38]  Z-Quest says air is flammable.
[1978.64 --> 1979.58]  That's a pretty good point.
[1980.50 --> 1981.00]  Pretty good point.
[1981.52 --> 1982.38]  Think about that one.
[1983.38 --> 1991.72]  So, anyway, the point is that this is the kind of regulatory burden
[1991.72 --> 1997.08]  where we're not using common sense, right?
[1997.98 --> 2001.22]  We aren't applying a common sense filter.
[2001.32 --> 2005.76]  And I do understand that basically every regulation exists
[2005.76 --> 2008.78]  because somebody died at some point, right?
[2010.66 --> 2012.70]  But if we're looking at it going, okay,
[2012.84 --> 2013.18]  we're sued.
[2013.42 --> 2016.18]  I think this is something that could very easily be overcome
[2016.18 --> 2019.48]  if they just say, yeah, okay, that totally makes sense
[2019.48 --> 2021.76]  that you're only going to have at maximum
[2021.76 --> 2023.72]  like 30 or 40 people in this area.
[2023.96 --> 2026.20]  The bulk of the people are going to be in the other area.
[2027.72 --> 2029.84]  And you're not going to have any racking.
[2029.98 --> 2031.64]  You're not going to have any obstructions.
[2032.24 --> 2033.20]  Yeah, that's fine.
[2033.68 --> 2036.98]  So it's like we'll approve the TUP provisionally
[2036.98 --> 2038.62]  based on that that continues to be the case.
[2038.66 --> 2039.16]  That's easy.
[2039.88 --> 2040.44]  That's easy.
[2040.44 --> 2045.58]  But the issue is that people are either not empowered
[2045.58 --> 2049.88]  or they are not savvy enough to make these kinds of calls
[2049.88 --> 2051.12]  on their own.
[2052.64 --> 2056.48]  And so you end up having to escalate and escalate
[2056.48 --> 2058.34]  and jump through hoops and red tape.
[2059.16 --> 2060.78]  And so from a business,
[2060.86 --> 2062.72]  and I'm not even trying to do anything complicated.
[2062.72 --> 2070.26]  All I am trying to do is put some desks in a warehouse.
[2072.00 --> 2075.88]  Ironically, we're zoned for bingo, right?
[2075.98 --> 2077.64]  You can be a bingo hall here.
[2078.50 --> 2080.32]  And part of my argument to the city
[2080.32 --> 2082.60]  that actually got the ball rolling in the first place
[2082.60 --> 2085.36]  is like land gaming is just bingo
[2085.36 --> 2087.74]  from a logistical standpoint.
[2088.34 --> 2090.70]  You've got like someone at the knock
[2090.70 --> 2095.56]  or the, you know, the rolly ball wheel thing, right?
[2095.88 --> 2097.70]  They pull out the balls
[2097.70 --> 2098.84]  and then you've got all the players
[2098.84 --> 2101.22]  sitting at their desks with their peripherals,
[2101.40 --> 2103.06]  whether it's a bingo stamper
[2103.06 --> 2104.26]  or whether it's a keyboard mouse,
[2104.34 --> 2105.40]  what difference does it make?
[2106.84 --> 2109.26]  From a layout standpoint,
[2109.48 --> 2111.14]  from a density standpoint,
[2111.38 --> 2112.92]  it is the exact same thing.
[2112.98 --> 2114.16]  The only difference is that
[2114.16 --> 2116.66]  someone who ran a bingo hall,
[2117.00 --> 2118.74]  you know, 40 years ago or whatever,
[2119.06 --> 2119.68]  greased the palm.
[2120.70 --> 2122.12]  Of someone in city hall
[2122.12 --> 2123.46]  and got an exemption.
[2123.80 --> 2124.94]  That's the only difference.
[2125.80 --> 2126.08]  Right?
[2128.34 --> 2129.38]  We should play.
[2129.56 --> 2131.04]  You should just, there's your solution.
[2131.62 --> 2133.02]  You should just play one game
[2133.02 --> 2134.32]  of like online bingo
[2134.32 --> 2136.14]  at the start of the LAN.
[2136.26 --> 2137.20]  Everyone has to play bingo.
[2140.00 --> 2140.44]  Easy.
[2140.44 --> 2143.52]  We want to do things properly.
[2143.52 --> 2143.84]  We,
[2143.84 --> 2147.16]  I don't even know why anymore.
[2147.36 --> 2148.54]  I kind of alluded to this anyways.
[2148.66 --> 2149.94]  It's like most of the reasons why
[2149.94 --> 2152.62]  these rules can be super annoying
[2152.62 --> 2154.84]  is because there will be
[2154.84 --> 2156.60]  a small handful of people
[2156.60 --> 2157.94]  that will ruin it for everyone.
[2158.18 --> 2159.36]  Because there's going to be people
[2159.36 --> 2160.48]  that will try to use
[2160.48 --> 2162.50]  worming around the letter of the law
[2162.50 --> 2165.92]  to get bull crap made.
[2165.92 --> 2167.00]  Um,
[2167.36 --> 2168.64]  and that makes it so that
[2168.64 --> 2169.62]  things have to be worded
[2169.62 --> 2170.78]  in really annoying ways
[2170.78 --> 2171.58]  that end up resulting
[2171.58 --> 2173.32]  in these really annoying situations
[2173.32 --> 2174.24]  for people that are trying
[2174.24 --> 2175.06]  to follow the rules.
[2175.80 --> 2176.16]  Um,
[2176.36 --> 2176.70]  bullshit.
[2176.94 --> 2177.10]  Yeah,
[2177.10 --> 2177.52]  I don't know.
[2177.62 --> 2178.14]  I'm out of it.
[2178.16 --> 2178.50]  I'm sorry.
[2179.20 --> 2179.52]  Um,
[2179.60 --> 2182.56]  but yeah,
[2182.60 --> 2182.90]  I mean,
[2182.94 --> 2184.16]  that's where a lot of regulation
[2184.16 --> 2184.62]  comes from.
[2184.62 --> 2184.82]  Like,
[2184.92 --> 2186.14]  you,
[2186.24 --> 2186.90]  you run into this
[2186.90 --> 2188.06]  when moderating communities,
[2188.06 --> 2188.32]  right?
[2189.08 --> 2189.80]  Like people,
[2190.24 --> 2190.52]  you,
[2190.60 --> 2191.46]  you have to start putting in
[2191.46 --> 2192.86]  these like super annoying rules
[2192.86 --> 2195.08]  because people are going to
[2195.08 --> 2196.02]  try to skirt around them
[2196.02 --> 2196.38]  and then you,
[2196.46 --> 2197.58]  you put another rule in place
[2197.58 --> 2198.54]  and they try to skirt around that.
[2198.58 --> 2199.62]  Then you put another rule in place
[2199.62 --> 2200.52]  and now you have all the,
[2200.56 --> 2202.04]  this trail of rules in place
[2202.04 --> 2202.66]  because these people
[2202.66 --> 2203.94]  trying to get around everything
[2203.94 --> 2205.34]  and this trail of rules
[2205.34 --> 2206.06]  are really annoying
[2206.06 --> 2206.70]  for everyone else.
[2206.70 --> 2207.92]  Let's just try to have,
[2207.92 --> 2208.56]  uh,
[2208.56 --> 2209.56]  good faith conversation.
[2209.80 --> 2210.20]  It's,
[2210.32 --> 2211.26]  it's really annoying.
[2211.70 --> 2212.10]  Um,
[2212.50 --> 2213.90]  I had a conversation
[2213.90 --> 2215.56]  with a city staffer at one point.
[2215.66 --> 2216.58]  I won't say which city
[2216.58 --> 2218.08]  because I don't want to identify them,
[2218.08 --> 2219.82]  but they basically said,
[2219.86 --> 2220.06]  okay,
[2220.06 --> 2220.40]  like,
[2220.62 --> 2220.88]  you know,
[2220.90 --> 2222.04]  what do you need from us?
[2223.42 --> 2224.78]  And my response
[2224.78 --> 2226.78]  in typical business owner fashion
[2226.78 --> 2227.64]  was I want for you
[2227.64 --> 2228.40]  to get out of my way.
[2229.06 --> 2230.44]  I don't actually want
[2230.44 --> 2231.80]  anything from you.
[2233.60 --> 2235.82]  I just want to get things done.
[2235.88 --> 2236.86]  I want to do things.
[2237.28 --> 2237.72]  And so,
[2237.92 --> 2239.16]  I guess the reason
[2239.16 --> 2240.02]  I'm bringing this up
[2240.02 --> 2242.40]  is because I want to make it clear
[2242.40 --> 2244.54]  that from a business owner perspective,
[2244.54 --> 2246.32]  I understand
[2246.32 --> 2248.76]  where businesses are coming from
[2248.76 --> 2250.12]  when they complain
[2250.12 --> 2251.96]  about burdensome regulation.
[2252.40 --> 2252.76]  Uh,
[2252.76 --> 2254.34]  not being able to lock
[2254.34 --> 2255.40]  the room
[2255.40 --> 2256.74]  for a LAN party
[2256.74 --> 2258.76]  against random badminton players
[2258.76 --> 2259.28]  coming in
[2259.28 --> 2260.62]  and potentially stealing things
[2260.62 --> 2263.02]  is a major user issue.
[2263.02 --> 2263.98]  Um,
[2264.06 --> 2265.40]  it's not that I object.
[2265.62 --> 2266.54]  I don't care.
[2267.04 --> 2267.50]  I can,
[2267.66 --> 2268.08]  I could,
[2268.18 --> 2269.34]  I could put a,
[2269.54 --> 2269.84]  you know,
[2270.22 --> 2272.04]  I could bolt my computer
[2272.04 --> 2272.54]  to the desk
[2272.54 --> 2273.50]  if I really felt like it.
[2273.50 --> 2274.24]  I own the place.
[2274.46 --> 2274.90]  Right?
[2274.90 --> 2276.42]  But from a user standpoint,
[2276.86 --> 2277.46]  that is
[2277.46 --> 2279.48]  really important.
[2279.48 --> 2280.28]  I would hate that
[2280.28 --> 2281.08]  as a land goer.
[2281.28 --> 2282.36]  That would annoy the heck out of me.
[2282.86 --> 2283.44]  of course.
[2283.82 --> 2284.16]  And,
[2284.36 --> 2285.08]  common sense,
[2285.44 --> 2286.38]  there is absolutely
[2286.38 --> 2287.24]  no reason
[2287.24 --> 2288.78]  that we need to be able,
[2288.92 --> 2289.66]  that we need to keep
[2289.66 --> 2290.46]  the doors unlocked
[2290.46 --> 2292.22]  because the occupancy
[2292.22 --> 2293.28]  of the one side
[2293.28 --> 2294.60]  will always be
[2294.60 --> 2295.82]  the same as it is now
[2295.82 --> 2297.28]  and I'm the one
[2297.28 --> 2298.34]  who put those doors there.
[2298.58 --> 2299.76]  If it was good enough
[2299.76 --> 2301.26]  before I put the doors there,
[2301.38 --> 2302.54]  then it's good enough
[2302.54 --> 2303.60]  if the doors are locked.
[2304.62 --> 2305.02]  Period.
[2307.74 --> 2308.14]  Yeah.
[2308.34 --> 2308.88]  But no.
[2309.40 --> 2310.28]  But no.
[2310.54 --> 2310.78]  That's not.
[2310.78 --> 2311.44]  One of the problems too though
[2311.44 --> 2312.42]  is like you'll go around
[2312.42 --> 2313.06]  every once in a while
[2313.06 --> 2313.86]  and you'll find something
[2313.86 --> 2314.42]  that is
[2314.42 --> 2317.12]  like clearly unsafe
[2317.12 --> 2318.78]  because someone
[2318.78 --> 2319.64]  didn't follow
[2319.64 --> 2320.24]  regulations
[2320.24 --> 2321.24]  and you know
[2321.24 --> 2321.88]  that they just like
[2321.88 --> 2322.38]  have somehow
[2322.38 --> 2323.30]  dodged inspections
[2323.30 --> 2323.84]  or whatever.
[2326.20 --> 2328.10]  And it's frustrating
[2328.10 --> 2328.84]  because it's this,
[2328.92 --> 2329.06]  yeah,
[2329.14 --> 2329.94]  this small group of people
[2329.94 --> 2330.66]  ruins it for everybody.
[2330.80 --> 2331.22]  So yeah,
[2331.28 --> 2331.62]  anyways,
[2332.10 --> 2333.44]  back to what I was saying before,
[2333.56 --> 2335.06]  I can understand the idea
[2335.06 --> 2337.32]  of like special
[2337.32 --> 2339.14]  rapid development zones,
[2339.14 --> 2340.94]  but I don't agree
[2340.94 --> 2342.26]  with the no regulation.
[2342.94 --> 2344.38]  I think you have
[2344.38 --> 2345.92]  representatives there
[2345.92 --> 2347.28]  supporting these companies
[2347.28 --> 2348.28]  trying to get things
[2348.28 --> 2349.26]  pushed through quickly
[2349.26 --> 2349.98]  and their job
[2349.98 --> 2350.60]  is to
[2350.60 --> 2352.80]  try to
[2352.80 --> 2354.26]  not slow them down
[2354.26 --> 2355.08]  as much as possible,
[2355.22 --> 2355.92]  but while keeping
[2355.92 --> 2357.48]  safety minimums
[2357.48 --> 2358.04]  in place.
[2359.38 --> 2359.66]  I mean,
[2359.68 --> 2360.54]  that's hard to do,
[2360.62 --> 2361.48]  especially when
[2361.48 --> 2362.64]  like we ran into,
[2362.80 --> 2364.12]  we ran into a big challenge
[2364.12 --> 2364.84]  with the lighting
[2364.84 --> 2366.66]  where it took us
[2366.66 --> 2367.50]  three attempts
[2367.50 --> 2368.38]  to get an engineer
[2368.38 --> 2369.36]  that would sign off
[2369.36 --> 2371.64]  on our suspended lights
[2371.64 --> 2372.12]  in the ceiling
[2372.12 --> 2373.34]  because it's their liability.
[2373.34 --> 2375.64]  like a lot of the time
[2375.64 --> 2377.28]  these regulations
[2377.28 --> 2377.94]  are not even
[2377.94 --> 2378.76]  strictly speaking
[2378.76 --> 2379.50]  regulations,
[2379.50 --> 2380.44]  but what they are
[2380.44 --> 2381.00]  is just
[2381.00 --> 2383.02]  whether it's a firm
[2383.02 --> 2383.66]  or whether it's
[2383.66 --> 2384.22]  an individual,
[2384.70 --> 2385.34]  it's someone
[2385.34 --> 2387.56]  covering their own butt.
[2388.50 --> 2388.92]  It's someone
[2388.92 --> 2389.48]  and
[2389.48 --> 2390.68]  and that
[2390.68 --> 2391.20]  there's a
[2391.20 --> 2392.48]  there's a good reason
[2392.48 --> 2393.46]  that you have
[2393.46 --> 2394.08]  like a
[2394.08 --> 2395.00]  like a liability
[2395.00 --> 2395.88]  chain
[2395.88 --> 2397.10]  that you have liability
[2397.10 --> 2397.50]  because
[2397.50 --> 2399.08]  it makes people
[2399.08 --> 2400.58]  strongly incentivized
[2400.58 --> 2401.88]  to do a good job
[2401.88 --> 2403.02]  and to be clear,
[2403.16 --> 2404.12]  it's not that we
[2404.12 --> 2405.80]  didn't do a good job
[2405.80 --> 2406.76]  of seismically
[2406.76 --> 2408.20]  fastening the lights
[2408.20 --> 2408.82]  to the ceiling.
[2409.06 --> 2410.12]  It's just that
[2410.12 --> 2411.14]  engineers tend
[2411.14 --> 2411.94]  to want things
[2411.94 --> 2412.78]  overbuilt
[2412.78 --> 2414.04]  4x,
[2414.66 --> 2415.00]  you know,
[2415.16 --> 2415.96]  and
[2415.96 --> 2417.60]  we were like,
[2417.68 --> 2417.96]  okay,
[2418.12 --> 2419.02]  we're fine
[2419.02 --> 2419.88]  to overbuild
[2419.88 --> 2420.74]  4x,
[2420.90 --> 2422.18]  but it needs to be done
[2422.18 --> 2422.60]  in a way
[2422.60 --> 2423.50]  that doesn't have,
[2423.58 --> 2424.02]  you know,
[2424.16 --> 2424.96]  wire cables
[2424.96 --> 2425.92]  hanging over the courts
[2425.92 --> 2427.02]  because they will interfere
[2427.02 --> 2427.82]  with the
[2427.82 --> 2428.74]  with the
[2428.74 --> 2429.30]  with the shuttle
[2429.30 --> 2430.16]  being hit.
[2431.20 --> 2431.54]  And so
[2431.54 --> 2432.46]  finally,
[2432.74 --> 2433.76]  we made our way
[2433.76 --> 2434.40]  to one that would
[2434.40 --> 2435.30]  allow us to just
[2435.30 --> 2435.82]  add,
[2436.34 --> 2436.98]  I think it was like
[2436.98 --> 2438.06]  half a dozen more
[2438.06 --> 2439.06]  cables to every
[2439.06 --> 2439.66]  light fixture,
[2439.86 --> 2440.60]  but have them go
[2440.60 --> 2441.10]  straight up.
[2441.28 --> 2441.70]  We're like,
[2441.76 --> 2441.96]  okay,
[2442.04 --> 2442.68]  thank you.
[2443.52 --> 2444.22]  But that's the thing
[2444.22 --> 2444.92]  is just because
[2444.92 --> 2446.46]  you have that person
[2446.46 --> 2447.56]  on site doesn't mean
[2447.56 --> 2447.94]  that they're going
[2447.94 --> 2448.72]  to sign off on
[2448.72 --> 2450.40]  your nuclear test
[2450.40 --> 2451.16]  because if it's
[2451.16 --> 2451.90]  their liability.
[2452.14 --> 2452.54]  To be clear.
[2452.72 --> 2453.10]  Exactly.
[2453.36 --> 2454.06]  Because if it's
[2454.06 --> 2454.80]  their liability,
[2454.80 --> 2455.94]  then it's their butt.
[2456.82 --> 2457.56]  And to me,
[2457.56 --> 2458.58]  it's like a
[2458.58 --> 2461.16]  an exposure thing.
[2461.26 --> 2461.90]  Like if you're there
[2461.90 --> 2462.64]  working on this type
[2462.64 --> 2463.60]  of stuff all the time,
[2463.60 --> 2465.22]  maybe that would help.
[2465.22 --> 2467.10]  And if you have
[2467.10 --> 2468.68]  maybe less
[2468.68 --> 2469.64]  total overall
[2469.64 --> 2470.56]  work to do,
[2470.64 --> 2471.92]  you're able to focus
[2471.92 --> 2472.90]  on pushing
[2472.90 --> 2474.06]  approvals through
[2474.06 --> 2475.04]  for individual
[2475.04 --> 2475.88]  things faster.
[2475.98 --> 2476.22]  Maybe.
[2476.36 --> 2476.72]  I don't know.
[2476.82 --> 2477.28]  I don't know what
[2477.28 --> 2478.10]  that job is like.
[2478.46 --> 2479.46]  I could just be
[2479.46 --> 2480.82]  completely incorrect.
[2480.82 --> 2481.44]  but,
[2481.44 --> 2482.72]  um,
[2483.40 --> 2484.80]  I'm just saying,
[2484.88 --> 2485.40]  I think I,
[2485.54 --> 2485.90]  like I,
[2485.90 --> 2486.14]  I,
[2486.14 --> 2487.30]  I sincerely
[2487.30 --> 2489.80]  doubt that
[2489.80 --> 2491.56]  the major hurdle
[2491.56 --> 2492.48]  for things like
[2492.48 --> 2493.46]  human trials
[2493.46 --> 2494.24]  is,
[2494.50 --> 2494.98]  um,
[2495.40 --> 2500.46]  well,
[2500.54 --> 2500.88]  I don't know.
[2500.92 --> 2501.36]  It could be.
[2501.46 --> 2501.92]  It could be.
[2502.22 --> 2503.08]  The major hurdle
[2503.08 --> 2503.76]  could be that
[2503.76 --> 2504.54]  it's just impossible
[2504.54 --> 2505.28]  to get anyone
[2505.28 --> 2505.74]  to,
[2505.74 --> 2506.68]  to,
[2506.82 --> 2507.72]  to look at it
[2507.72 --> 2508.40]  and say that's okay.
[2508.40 --> 2508.66]  I mean,
[2508.66 --> 2509.22]  I had some,
[2509.30 --> 2510.14]  someone posted in,
[2510.26 --> 2510.48]  uh,
[2510.48 --> 2511.30]  in the chat earlier.
[2511.30 --> 2512.22]  Let me bring this up.
[2512.44 --> 2513.10]  Bot said,
[2513.22 --> 2513.36]  Hey,
[2513.44 --> 2514.24]  if there's informed
[2514.24 --> 2515.02]  consent and the
[2515.02 --> 2515.80]  people are terminal,
[2516.02 --> 2516.96]  why shouldn't they
[2516.96 --> 2517.64]  be able to agree
[2517.64 --> 2518.44]  to a risky trial?
[2518.50 --> 2518.82]  Linus,
[2519.44 --> 2520.10]  my understanding
[2520.10 --> 2520.92]  though is,
[2521.40 --> 2521.56]  well,
[2521.58 --> 2522.10]  there's two things
[2522.10 --> 2522.24]  there.
[2522.28 --> 2522.82]  My understanding
[2522.82 --> 2523.88]  is for terminal
[2523.88 --> 2524.74]  patients,
[2524.74 --> 2525.28]  it's,
[2525.38 --> 2526.58]  it is pretty common
[2526.58 --> 2527.56]  for them to participate
[2527.56 --> 2528.40]  in risky trials.
[2528.40 --> 2529.26]  Like that is already
[2529.26 --> 2529.78]  a thing.
[2530.14 --> 2531.10]  As for the informed
[2531.10 --> 2531.58]  consent,
[2531.70 --> 2532.52]  that's where I have
[2532.52 --> 2533.20]  a bit of an issue
[2533.20 --> 2535.02]  because I don't know
[2535.02 --> 2535.76]  if you've ever met
[2535.76 --> 2536.82]  the average person.
[2536.82 --> 2540.00]  Or anyone below
[2540.00 --> 2541.72]  that average point
[2541.72 --> 2545.24]  informing them.
[2546.32 --> 2546.96]  Um,
[2547.26 --> 2550.58]  people can very easily
[2550.58 --> 2552.18]  be taken advantage of
[2552.18 --> 2553.80]  and be convinced
[2553.80 --> 2556.36]  to informally
[2556.36 --> 2557.76]  participate in something
[2557.76 --> 2559.40]  or they can be
[2559.40 --> 2559.62]  coerced.
[2559.62 --> 2560.36]  People can also just be
[2560.36 --> 2561.10]  really desperate.
[2562.22 --> 2562.90]  Yeah.
[2563.02 --> 2563.66]  And if they haven't been
[2563.66 --> 2564.38]  able to find work
[2564.38 --> 2565.04]  in a year
[2565.04 --> 2566.98]  and they can't
[2566.98 --> 2567.64]  make ends meet
[2567.64 --> 2568.14]  and you're like,
[2568.20 --> 2568.34]  hey,
[2568.36 --> 2568.96]  I'll give you,
[2569.62 --> 2571.18]  I'll give you 10 grand
[2571.18 --> 2572.20]  if you shove this
[2572.20 --> 2572.94]  needle in your arm
[2572.94 --> 2574.38]  and then I get to
[2574.38 --> 2575.30]  watch you for a week
[2575.30 --> 2576.48]  and maybe you die.
[2576.62 --> 2577.00]  Who knows?
[2578.98 --> 2579.80]  Neospra says
[2579.80 --> 2580.86]  they can absolutely
[2580.86 --> 2581.34]  do it,
[2581.40 --> 2581.94]  but the problem
[2581.94 --> 2582.62]  is that companies
[2582.62 --> 2583.48]  don't want to report
[2583.48 --> 2584.48]  deaths in their studies
[2584.48 --> 2585.78]  and they have to
[2585.78 --> 2586.48]  report studies
[2586.48 --> 2587.08]  when they're used
[2587.08 --> 2587.78]  during compassionate
[2587.78 --> 2588.48]  care trials.
[2590.98 --> 2591.62]  Tommen said,
[2591.70 --> 2592.24]  isn't that the plot
[2592.24 --> 2592.84]  of Squid Games?
[2592.84 --> 2593.72]  Yeah,
[2593.82 --> 2594.30]  kind of.
[2597.12 --> 2597.78]  I think.
[2600.98 --> 2601.66]  I haven't actually
[2601.66 --> 2602.12]  watched it.
[2602.14 --> 2602.54]  I don't know,
[2602.60 --> 2602.76]  man.
[2602.92 --> 2604.76]  I see this whole
[2604.76 --> 2605.78]  issue from both sides.
[2606.00 --> 2607.34]  It is very clear to me
[2607.34 --> 2608.10]  as someone who's
[2608.10 --> 2608.90]  trying to run a business
[2608.90 --> 2609.94]  and can't just get
[2609.94 --> 2611.14]  common sense stuff done
[2611.14 --> 2613.62]  that there are problems
[2613.62 --> 2616.10]  with our current system
[2616.10 --> 2617.56]  and that if we want
[2617.56 --> 2618.30]  to be competitive,
[2619.08 --> 2619.70]  like the fact that
[2619.70 --> 2620.20]  I can't even,
[2620.32 --> 2621.38]  it takes me like a year
[2621.38 --> 2622.42]  to open a stupid
[2622.42 --> 2623.62]  badminton center.
[2623.72 --> 2624.54]  It's just a box.
[2624.66 --> 2625.28]  My God,
[2625.32 --> 2626.18]  it's just a box
[2626.18 --> 2626.88]  with some lights.
[2627.50 --> 2627.74]  Like,
[2628.16 --> 2628.64]  who cares?
[2629.68 --> 2630.18]  You know,
[2630.20 --> 2630.84]  even getting something
[2630.84 --> 2631.38]  like that done,
[2631.40 --> 2632.42]  it took me five years
[2632.42 --> 2633.52]  to find something
[2633.52 --> 2634.40]  with the right zoning.
[2635.26 --> 2636.00]  Are both sides
[2636.00 --> 2636.48]  open yet?
[2637.72 --> 2638.00]  Oh, yeah.
[2638.86 --> 2639.70]  Both sides are open?
[2640.00 --> 2640.58]  The floor is done
[2640.58 --> 2641.12]  on both sides?
[2641.96 --> 2643.02]  You better believe it.
[2643.02 --> 2643.96]  The new floor is done.
[2644.92 --> 2645.08]  Yeah.
[2645.20 --> 2645.72]  The only thing
[2645.72 --> 2646.74]  we're waiting on now
[2646.74 --> 2648.58]  is your stupid
[2648.58 --> 2649.80]  two and a half pound weights
[2649.80 --> 2650.82]  for the gym equipment
[2650.82 --> 2653.16]  and then we're also waiting
[2653.16 --> 2654.76]  on the temporary use permit
[2654.76 --> 2657.36]  for LAN esports gaming events.
[2657.68 --> 2658.26]  So would you say
[2658.26 --> 2660.10]  that it's open
[2660.10 --> 2661.04]  in March 2025?
[2662.80 --> 2663.30]  No,
[2663.40 --> 2664.72]  it was open already.
[2665.68 --> 2666.18]  It's been,
[2666.30 --> 2667.48]  both floors have been done
[2667.48 --> 2668.02]  since,
[2668.20 --> 2669.92]  it was either late January
[2669.92 --> 2671.10]  or early Feb.
[2671.78 --> 2672.04]  Nice.
[2672.56 --> 2673.32]  I think you win
[2673.32 --> 2674.08]  Price is Right though,
[2674.12 --> 2674.28]  Dan.
[2674.28 --> 2676.58]  Oh, I didn't go over.
[2676.58 --> 2676.74]  Oh, yeah.
[2676.82 --> 2677.12]  No, Dan,
[2677.20 --> 2679.06]  you're definitely the closest.
[2679.40 --> 2680.42]  You're definitely the closest.
[2681.12 --> 2681.32]  Yeah.
[2682.44 --> 2683.36]  We haven't,
[2683.56 --> 2684.22]  strictly speaking,
[2684.50 --> 2686.32]  done our grand opening event yet.
[2686.78 --> 2687.78]  So that's something.
[2688.18 --> 2688.70]  I think maybe
[2688.70 --> 2690.24]  that's what I was aiming for,
[2690.32 --> 2690.52]  yeah.
[2691.66 --> 2692.46]  We are absolutely
[2692.46 --> 2692.58]  taking people's money now.
[2692.58 --> 2693.64]  He's just not going to do it
[2693.64 --> 2694.64]  in this March.
[2695.10 --> 2695.38]  Sorry,
[2695.48 --> 2695.84]  in this March.
[2695.84 --> 2696.74]  In this March.
[2697.70 --> 2698.26]  Well, no,
[2698.32 --> 2699.50]  we can't do it in March anyway.
[2699.86 --> 2699.96]  No.
[2700.38 --> 2701.80]  I don't think it's going to happen
[2701.80 --> 2702.60]  until like the summer
[2702.60 --> 2704.68]  because we're coordinating
[2704.68 --> 2706.56]  with Badmintonology BC.
[2706.86 --> 2707.74]  They're like a local group
[2707.74 --> 2708.64]  that's been running tournaments
[2708.64 --> 2709.90]  for like 15 years
[2709.90 --> 2710.82]  or something like that.
[2710.98 --> 2711.78]  And we're like,
[2711.82 --> 2711.92]  yeah,
[2711.92 --> 2713.54]  we could run our grand opening tournament
[2713.54 --> 2714.98]  or,
[2715.18 --> 2716.34]  or hear me out,
[2716.60 --> 2717.58]  we could bring in people
[2717.58 --> 2718.96]  with a decade and a half
[2718.96 --> 2719.76]  of experience
[2719.76 --> 2721.14]  and-
[2721.14 --> 2721.42]  Yeah, why not?
[2722.24 --> 2722.56]  Just,
[2723.02 --> 2723.38]  yeah,
[2723.46 --> 2724.52]  they have to pay
[2724.52 --> 2725.74]  like exorbitant rates
[2725.74 --> 2726.62]  for courts.
[2726.84 --> 2727.58]  So we're like,
[2727.64 --> 2727.90]  okay,
[2728.00 --> 2728.16]  well,
[2728.18 --> 2728.96]  why don't they make money
[2728.96 --> 2730.12]  on their event for a change?
[2730.12 --> 2732.26]  We just sponsor them
[2732.26 --> 2732.96]  the court time,
[2733.12 --> 2734.62]  we co-brand it,
[2735.12 --> 2736.70]  and then we get the benefit
[2736.70 --> 2737.90]  of them running a great tournament
[2737.90 --> 2738.90]  and they get the benefit
[2738.90 --> 2740.12]  of actually like making money
[2740.12 --> 2741.00]  instead of just doing this
[2741.00 --> 2741.84]  for fun for a change.
[2742.06 --> 2742.38]  Sick.
[2742.38 --> 2742.66]  So,
[2742.86 --> 2742.98]  yeah,
[2743.08 --> 2744.88]  I think it's a good win-win.
[2745.00 --> 2746.00]  I'm all about win-wins.
[2746.02 --> 2747.14]  Would they crank the prizes
[2747.14 --> 2747.98]  because of that?
[2749.18 --> 2749.86]  I don't know.
[2749.94 --> 2750.60]  I think that
[2750.60 --> 2751.84]  I'd love to see them
[2751.84 --> 2752.80]  do that,
[2752.92 --> 2754.48]  but I wouldn't want to
[2754.48 --> 2755.96]  tell them they have to do that.
[2756.52 --> 2756.58]  Like,
[2756.64 --> 2757.60]  if part of the whole thing
[2757.60 --> 2758.60]  is,
[2759.16 --> 2759.36]  you know,
[2759.42 --> 2760.68]  we're getting the benefit
[2760.68 --> 2761.24]  of promotion
[2761.24 --> 2762.30]  for our facility.
[2762.44 --> 2762.58]  Yeah.
[2763.76 --> 2764.16]  Yeah,
[2764.22 --> 2764.34]  no,
[2764.40 --> 2765.44]  I'm all about
[2765.44 --> 2766.70]  however many W's
[2766.70 --> 2767.54]  you can stack
[2767.54 --> 2768.64]  is like my favorite
[2768.64 --> 2769.20]  kind of deal.
[2770.26 --> 2771.18]  Exponential W's.
[2771.80 --> 2773.48]  Talking about stacking W's,
[2773.52 --> 2774.24]  how about some announcements
[2774.24 --> 2775.24]  and some merch messages?
[2776.18 --> 2776.38]  Oh,
[2776.40 --> 2776.60]  yeah,
[2776.60 --> 2777.58]  I guess we should do that.
[2777.70 --> 2778.20]  What a guy.
[2778.80 --> 2779.16]  No,
[2779.28 --> 2780.56]  we have one more discussion
[2780.56 --> 2781.70]  question that I wanted to get to.
[2781.70 --> 2781.82]  Did I?
[2782.24 --> 2782.50]  Okay,
[2782.56 --> 2783.36]  I gotta get some water then.
[2784.24 --> 2784.80]  Good luck.
[2784.80 --> 2785.58]  Is there,
[2785.74 --> 2786.36]  Luke,
[2786.36 --> 2788.12]  is there any
[2788.12 --> 2789.18]  corporation
[2789.18 --> 2791.10]  that you would trust
[2791.10 --> 2792.38]  to actually make
[2792.38 --> 2793.78]  a good freedom city
[2793.78 --> 2795.40]  that you would be willing
[2795.40 --> 2795.96]  to commit
[2795.96 --> 2796.60]  to live there
[2796.60 --> 2797.22]  for a year?
[2797.38 --> 2798.16]  This is a really good
[2798.16 --> 2798.94]  discussion question
[2798.94 --> 2800.10]  from the writer
[2800.10 --> 2800.80]  for this topic
[2800.80 --> 2802.30]  who I think was Jake
[2802.30 --> 2802.84]  based on that
[2802.84 --> 2803.84]  he was making little changes
[2803.84 --> 2804.54]  to it as we were
[2804.54 --> 2805.26]  going through it before.
[2806.96 --> 2808.02]  Don't look at chat.
[2808.14 --> 2808.80]  That's cheating.
[2808.92 --> 2809.30]  That's a hack.
[2809.30 --> 2810.34]  I won't say it,
[2810.38 --> 2810.92]  but they said
[2810.92 --> 2811.76]  such a good one.
[2812.20 --> 2813.20]  There was one in there
[2813.20 --> 2814.16]  that was sick.
[2814.54 --> 2815.66]  I won't say it though.
[2815.66 --> 2816.78]  I'm not going to say it.
[2816.94 --> 2817.78]  I'll say it afterwards.
[2818.04 --> 2818.82]  I'll save it.
[2819.32 --> 2820.04]  I wanted to
[2820.04 --> 2822.98]  throw a mildly
[2822.98 --> 2824.04]  obscure joke out there
[2824.04 --> 2824.90]  and say solar cities,
[2825.06 --> 2826.06]  but I'll stick away
[2826.06 --> 2827.00]  from that.
[2828.42 --> 2829.26]  Even though,
[2829.54 --> 2829.94]  okay,
[2830.16 --> 2830.46]  yeah.
[2832.86 --> 2835.70]  A company.
[2836.64 --> 2837.50]  A company.
[2838.02 --> 2839.12]  They have to be a company.
[2839.34 --> 2839.74]  In fact,
[2839.82 --> 2841.10]  I'm even going to make it worse.
[2841.10 --> 2842.62]  They have to be publicly traded.
[2843.28 --> 2844.10]  Publicly trade.
[2844.24 --> 2845.76]  Oh my God.
[2846.58 --> 2846.98]  Yeah.
[2848.00 --> 2849.22]  They have to have enough
[2849.22 --> 2850.84]  integrity in their DNA.
[2854.26 --> 2855.18]  I don't even know
[2855.18 --> 2856.22]  like what company.
[2856.34 --> 2857.46]  I'm not a stock bro.
[2857.64 --> 2858.50]  I don't know what companies
[2858.50 --> 2859.48]  are publicly traded.
[2860.96 --> 2861.80]  Most of them are.
[2861.90 --> 2863.02]  If you can think of them,
[2863.12 --> 2864.54]  they're probably publicly traded.
[2864.54 --> 2867.88]  Oh man.
[2868.16 --> 2868.84]  So many of the things
[2868.84 --> 2870.44]  that I can think of
[2870.44 --> 2871.02]  are just going to
[2871.02 --> 2872.24]  sound so lame
[2872.24 --> 2873.36]  if I try to throw it out there.
[2878.54 --> 2879.72]  I think I've got one.
[2881.40 --> 2882.46]  I've got one.
[2883.00 --> 2884.32]  I don't think it's very good though.
[2885.32 --> 2885.64]  Okay.
[2885.82 --> 2886.24]  No, I don't like mine.
[2886.24 --> 2886.42]  All right.
[2886.42 --> 2887.06]  You want to go first?
[2887.14 --> 2887.86]  I don't like mine,
[2887.92 --> 2888.76]  but I can go first.
[2890.12 --> 2890.48]  Okay.
[2890.48 --> 2892.58]  I'll do two.
[2893.10 --> 2893.92]  I don't like either of them.
[2893.96 --> 2894.24]  Okay.
[2894.96 --> 2895.36]  All right.
[2895.58 --> 2896.48]  Framework and Valve.
[2897.90 --> 2898.26]  Framework.
[2898.38 --> 2898.52]  Okay.
[2898.56 --> 2899.54]  Valve's not publicly traded
[2899.54 --> 2900.44]  in either of those Framework.
[2900.64 --> 2901.24]  So yeah, you
[2901.24 --> 2903.18]  swing and miss on both parts.
[2903.54 --> 2904.14]  Well, you told me
[2904.14 --> 2904.76]  they'd all be
[2904.76 --> 2906.76]  and I found two that weren't.
[2906.98 --> 2907.34]  Okay.
[2907.78 --> 2908.32]  Look at me
[2908.32 --> 2909.52]  being a special boy.
[2910.98 --> 2911.86]  I would live in.
[2911.86 --> 2913.78]  I would consider
[2913.78 --> 2915.16]  investment disclosure.
[2915.54 --> 2916.26]  I would consider
[2916.26 --> 2917.36]  living in Framework City.
[2917.64 --> 2917.86]  Yeah.
[2918.00 --> 2919.28]  I feel like they'd have a good
[2919.28 --> 2921.00]  framework
[2921.00 --> 2923.20]  for how things should be set up.
[2924.14 --> 2925.18]  I'm going to say
[2925.18 --> 2926.16]  I'm going to say
[2926.16 --> 2926.88]  Royal Caribbean.
[2930.16 --> 2931.08]  Not because
[2931.08 --> 2932.40]  I think that everything
[2932.40 --> 2933.28]  that they do
[2933.28 --> 2934.62]  would be like
[2934.62 --> 2936.86]  amazing in any way.
[2936.94 --> 2937.92]  That doesn't feel fair.
[2938.96 --> 2940.02]  If they float into
[2940.02 --> 2940.96]  international waters,
[2941.14 --> 2942.02]  aren't they just
[2942.02 --> 2943.06]  effectively doing that?
[2944.22 --> 2946.22]  No, they're governed by laws,
[2946.32 --> 2947.38]  but it's complicated.
[2947.38 --> 2948.08]  Huh.
[2950.48 --> 2951.10]  But yeah,
[2951.16 --> 2951.76]  I feel like
[2951.76 --> 2952.52]  I feel like
[2952.52 --> 2954.28]  I just feel like
[2954.28 --> 2955.52]  whatever their city
[2955.52 --> 2956.42]  would be
[2956.42 --> 2957.98]  would probably be
[2957.98 --> 2960.24]  I don't know
[2960.24 --> 2961.10]  if they'd get a lot
[2961.10 --> 2961.68]  of work done
[2961.68 --> 2962.10]  or whatever,
[2962.36 --> 2963.72]  but they would
[2963.72 --> 2964.82]  it would be comfortable.
[2965.00 --> 2965.90]  It'd be very comfortable.
[2966.16 --> 2967.26]  I think I could live there
[2967.26 --> 2967.78]  for a year.
[2969.24 --> 2969.90]  But yeah,
[2970.00 --> 2970.16]  no,
[2970.22 --> 2971.02]  chat definitely had
[2971.02 --> 2971.56]  the best one.
[2971.76 --> 2972.66]  Costco is definitely
[2972.66 --> 2973.30]  the best answer.
[2973.48 --> 2974.50]  I would live in Costco City.
[2974.58 --> 2975.50]  The second I saw Costco,
[2975.62 --> 2975.84]  I was like,
[2975.84 --> 2977.22]  oh, of course.
[2977.56 --> 2978.06]  They already have
[2978.06 --> 2978.82]  Kirkland clothing.
[2979.32 --> 2979.54]  Yeah.
[2979.74 --> 2979.96]  Yeah.
[2980.76 --> 2981.16]  100%.
[2981.16 --> 2981.94]  $1.50
[2981.94 --> 2982.84]  I would just
[2982.84 --> 2984.74]  I would unironically
[2984.74 --> 2985.96]  shop at the company store
[2985.96 --> 2987.16]  always.
[2987.48 --> 2988.64]  You know what?
[2988.68 --> 2989.18]  I'm just going to
[2989.18 --> 2989.62]  I'm just going to
[2989.62 --> 2990.44]  break it right now.
[2990.78 --> 2992.02]  The you want to know
[2992.02 --> 2993.18]  what Lizzie
[2993.18 --> 2993.66]  do you want to know
[2993.66 --> 2994.76]  what the labs voted
[2994.76 --> 2996.10]  as the quarterly activity
[2996.10 --> 2996.78]  that they want to do
[2996.78 --> 2997.26]  this quarter?
[2997.68 --> 2998.08]  Do you know what
[2998.08 --> 2999.44]  they voted it to be?
[3000.34 --> 3001.84]  And it won by like
[3001.84 --> 3003.40]  I literally don't know
[3003.40 --> 3004.82]  if anyone voted for it
[3004.82 --> 3006.16]  for any other.
[3006.30 --> 3007.62]  I think literally
[3007.62 --> 3008.60]  every single person
[3008.60 --> 3009.24]  voted for this.
[3009.30 --> 3010.10]  I think it's unanimous.
[3011.34 --> 3012.30]  They just want to
[3012.30 --> 3012.98]  go to Costco.
[3014.32 --> 3014.80]  What?
[3016.22 --> 3017.12]  And do what?
[3017.22 --> 3018.68]  Like eat the sample food?
[3018.68 --> 3019.20]  Just
[3019.20 --> 3020.36]  just
[3020.36 --> 3022.28]  just be at Costco,
[3022.42 --> 3022.84]  I guess.
[3023.12 --> 3023.86]  Costco poutine
[3023.86 --> 3024.86]  is fire.
[3025.12 --> 3026.12]  Get cheap hot dogs.
[3026.12 --> 3032.44]  Just a bucket of hot dogs.
[3034.70 --> 3035.48]  Oh, OK.
[3035.78 --> 3037.04]  That sounds sick.
[3038.76 --> 3039.94]  You need one membership
[3039.94 --> 3040.80]  for every two people.
[3040.92 --> 3041.34]  Oh, OK.
[3041.34 --> 3042.42]  I didn't know that we were
[3042.42 --> 3043.36]  we were literally trying
[3043.36 --> 3044.24]  because they won.
[3044.32 --> 3045.02]  I was like, now we have
[3045.02 --> 3045.74]  to plan this.
[3045.74 --> 3047.20]  So like I was talking
[3047.20 --> 3048.50]  to Nick today about
[3048.50 --> 3049.82]  like how do we deal
[3049.82 --> 3051.02]  with because like
[3051.02 --> 3052.06]  accounting wants the
[3052.06 --> 3052.86]  expenses for the
[3052.86 --> 3053.76]  quarterly activities on
[3053.76 --> 3054.28]  one card.
[3054.36 --> 3055.04]  So I was like, can I
[3055.04 --> 3057.00]  buy whatever everyone
[3057.00 --> 3058.78]  wants to buy on one
[3058.78 --> 3060.08]  card at Costco
[3060.08 --> 3061.10]  when there's like
[3061.10 --> 3062.36]  a bunch of us?
[3062.40 --> 3063.34]  Like, does that work?
[3063.42 --> 3064.08]  Are you allowed to do
[3064.08 --> 3064.90]  that with memberships?
[3065.26 --> 3066.04]  I don't know.
[3066.74 --> 3067.70]  People say a gift card
[3067.70 --> 3068.34]  can get you in.
[3068.86 --> 3069.74]  So I'd have to
[3069.74 --> 3070.94]  I'd have to buy
[3070.94 --> 3074.00]  a bunch of gift cards.
[3075.08 --> 3076.04]  It maybe work.
[3076.80 --> 3077.54]  Yeah, they just wanted
[3077.54 --> 3078.24]  to go to Costco
[3078.24 --> 3079.18]  because like it's funny.
[3080.80 --> 3081.70]  It's kind of funny.
[3082.64 --> 3083.50]  It's pretty funny.
[3085.04 --> 3088.46]  People could buy
[3088.46 --> 3089.54]  snacks, I guess,
[3089.68 --> 3090.38]  for the labs.
[3091.54 --> 3092.80]  I'm pretty sure we get
[3092.80 --> 3093.74]  the company snacks
[3093.74 --> 3095.10]  from Costco already.
[3095.30 --> 3095.62]  Yeah, we do.
[3095.96 --> 3097.00]  So I don't know how
[3097.00 --> 3097.76]  different they're going
[3097.76 --> 3098.08]  to be.
[3098.28 --> 3099.24]  They want more of those
[3099.24 --> 3100.68]  Lucky Charm cookies.
[3102.60 --> 3103.34]  Pretty sure this
[3103.34 --> 3104.24]  breaks quarterly rules.
[3104.38 --> 3104.54]  Wow.
[3104.60 --> 3105.26]  There goes Elijah
[3105.26 --> 3106.24]  being a complete
[3106.24 --> 3106.92]  party pooper.
[3107.32 --> 3107.96]  How does that break
[3107.96 --> 3108.54]  quarterly rules?
[3108.56 --> 3109.50]  Also, I don't know
[3109.50 --> 3110.02]  actually.
[3110.98 --> 3112.48]  Because just buying
[3112.48 --> 3113.98]  stuff is not what
[3113.98 --> 3114.92]  the quarterly event.
[3114.92 --> 3115.60]  Well, the writers,
[3115.96 --> 3117.10]  Elijah, went to
[3117.10 --> 3118.14]  Safeway or whatever
[3118.14 --> 3119.14]  and bought groceries.
[3119.84 --> 3120.60]  So how is it that
[3120.60 --> 3121.36]  different if we buy
[3121.36 --> 3121.78]  snacks?
[3122.30 --> 3123.20]  The experience is
[3123.20 --> 3124.62]  going to Costco
[3124.62 --> 3125.20]  together.
[3125.68 --> 3126.50]  Yeah, and getting
[3126.50 --> 3127.42]  Uzis together.
[3128.04 --> 3128.96]  Like if you're a couple,
[3129.08 --> 3130.46]  that's a thing.
[3130.70 --> 3131.46]  That's like dangerous.
[3131.62 --> 3132.26]  It's like going to
[3132.26 --> 3132.68]  Ikea.
[3132.90 --> 3133.10]  It's like an event
[3133.10 --> 3134.38]  to me.
[3134.62 --> 3134.88]  Yeah.
[3135.48 --> 3137.24]  I'm going to leave
[3137.24 --> 3137.98]  this to...
[3138.74 --> 3139.46]  I'll find a way.
[3139.76 --> 3140.10]  It doesn't...
[3140.10 --> 3140.72]  See, this is the
[3140.72 --> 3142.26]  problem with regulations
[3142.26 --> 3142.92]  like we were just
[3142.92 --> 3143.52]  talking about earlier.
[3143.74 --> 3144.94]  I will find a way
[3144.94 --> 3146.18]  to make it follow
[3146.18 --> 3147.26]  the regulations that
[3147.26 --> 3148.04]  labs can go to
[3148.04 --> 3148.38]  Costco.
[3149.00 --> 3150.04]  The problem is that
[3150.04 --> 3151.36]  it's not my regulation.
[3151.66 --> 3153.04]  It's the CRA's
[3153.04 --> 3153.58]  regulation.
[3153.82 --> 3154.38]  That's fine.
[3154.56 --> 3155.26]  Oh, I see.
[3155.38 --> 3156.16]  So I'll read their
[3156.16 --> 3157.04]  regulations and I'll
[3157.04 --> 3157.66]  find a way.
[3158.44 --> 3159.04]  Oh, you're going to
[3159.04 --> 3160.00]  read the entire
[3160.00 --> 3161.46]  Canadian tax code?
[3161.80 --> 3162.08]  Yeah.
[3162.34 --> 3163.36]  Well, I'll get
[3163.36 --> 3164.46]  ChatGPT to do it
[3164.46 --> 3164.84]  or something.
[3166.16 --> 3167.14]  Because we just...
[3167.14 --> 3168.10]  If it's an event,
[3168.18 --> 3168.82]  it's like, okay,
[3168.82 --> 3169.70]  so we just need to
[3169.70 --> 3171.02]  find a thing that
[3171.02 --> 3172.28]  we need to do at
[3172.28 --> 3173.36]  Costco or something
[3173.36 --> 3174.36]  to do with Costco
[3174.36 --> 3175.22]  that makes it an
[3175.22 --> 3175.38]  event.
[3175.44 --> 3175.92]  That's fine.
[3175.98 --> 3176.62]  We can make it an
[3176.62 --> 3176.78]  event.
[3176.94 --> 3177.52]  The only thing
[3177.52 --> 3178.36]  labs requested is
[3178.36 --> 3179.14]  that we go to
[3179.14 --> 3179.52]  Costco.
[3179.64 --> 3180.26]  Outside of that,
[3180.36 --> 3181.90]  I can craft
[3181.90 --> 3182.74]  whatever.
[3182.74 --> 3184.00]  Event outage is
[3184.00 --> 3184.68]  to find the
[3184.68 --> 3185.64]  cheapest snacks at
[3185.64 --> 3186.00]  Costco.
[3186.84 --> 3187.44]  It's like a
[3187.44 --> 3187.76]  game.
[3187.92 --> 3188.76]  It's like a
[3188.76 --> 3189.24]  hunt.
[3189.32 --> 3190.02]  No, like I feel
[3190.02 --> 3190.40]  like a scavenger
[3190.40 --> 3190.68]  hunt.
[3191.08 --> 3192.68]  How many avocados
[3192.68 --> 3193.48]  can you buy?
[3194.06 --> 3194.62]  So I'll have to
[3194.62 --> 3195.42]  come up with
[3195.42 --> 3196.18]  something like pretty
[3196.18 --> 3196.86]  good, but I think
[3196.86 --> 3197.48]  there's a way to do
[3197.48 --> 3197.58]  it.
[3197.58 --> 3198.28]  You have to eat
[3198.28 --> 3199.24]  everything you buy
[3199.24 --> 3200.10]  in the Costco
[3200.10 --> 3200.86]  parking lot.
[3201.08 --> 3201.96]  It's a competition.
[3204.66 --> 3205.10]  Interesting.
[3206.10 --> 3207.08]  Actually, eating
[3207.08 --> 3208.24]  contests are against
[3208.24 --> 3209.30]  company policy as
[3209.30 --> 3209.50]  well.
[3209.70 --> 3211.06]  I thought it was a
[3211.06 --> 3211.88]  CRA policy.
[3212.06 --> 3212.32]  That's fair.
[3212.66 --> 3213.42]  Well, no, now we
[3213.42 --> 3213.96]  have layered
[3213.96 --> 3215.02]  policies.
[3215.80 --> 3216.54]  Yeah, eating and
[3216.54 --> 3217.80]  drinking competitions
[3217.80 --> 3218.84]  are against company
[3218.84 --> 3219.58]  policy because they
[3219.58 --> 3220.30]  can be dangerous.
[3220.42 --> 3220.90]  I like that.
[3220.96 --> 3221.48]  It's extremely
[3221.48 --> 3222.00]  reasonable.
[3222.74 --> 3223.50]  It's all about
[3223.50 --> 3223.98]  liability.
[3224.50 --> 3224.92]  It's all about
[3224.92 --> 3225.20]  liability.
[3225.36 --> 3226.14]  Do not play hide
[3226.14 --> 3226.62]  and seek in
[3226.62 --> 3226.96]  Costco.
[3226.96 --> 3227.90]  Ignore what
[3227.90 --> 3228.78]  Shade Slayer said
[3228.78 --> 3229.28]  in the chat.
[3230.06 --> 3230.84]  I forbid it.
[3232.20 --> 3233.02]  No, I forbid
[3233.02 --> 3233.28]  it.
[3235.34 --> 3236.22]  I have forbade
[3236.22 --> 3236.48]  it.
[3239.22 --> 3239.58]  Luke.
[3239.96 --> 3240.44]  No, no, no.
[3240.44 --> 3241.30]  Not hide and seek.
[3241.40 --> 3241.82]  No, no, no.
[3241.90 --> 3242.64]  I'm trying to think
[3242.64 --> 3243.24]  of other things.
[3243.32 --> 3243.64]  I'm trying to think
[3243.64 --> 3244.10]  of other things.
[3244.20 --> 3246.06]  Can we try to
[3246.06 --> 3246.88]  like test all the
[3246.88 --> 3247.28]  TVs?
[3249.28 --> 3250.28]  Can we do like
[3250.28 --> 3251.20]  field testing?
[3251.86 --> 3252.80]  Oh, don't be a
[3252.80 --> 3253.34]  nuisance.
[3253.34 --> 3255.46]  Oh, yeah.
[3255.48 --> 3255.90]  You're going to
[3255.90 --> 3257.00]  Costco for market
[3257.00 --> 3257.36]  research.
[3257.80 --> 3258.08]  Yeah.
[3259.08 --> 3259.44]  Yeah.
[3259.96 --> 3260.80]  I'm sure we can
[3260.80 --> 3261.30]  find a way for
[3261.30 --> 3261.54]  that.
[3261.82 --> 3262.70]  Then that's not an
[3262.70 --> 3263.06]  event.
[3263.46 --> 3263.96]  That's work.
[3263.96 --> 3264.38]  How is that not
[3264.38 --> 3264.68]  an event?
[3265.28 --> 3266.06]  You're not supposed
[3266.06 --> 3266.86]  to be working
[3266.86 --> 3267.92]  during the quarterly
[3267.92 --> 3268.32]  events.
[3268.40 --> 3268.90]  You're supposed to
[3268.90 --> 3269.76]  be having fun.
[3269.96 --> 3270.74]  Who can?
[3270.84 --> 3271.52]  There's our labs
[3271.52 --> 3271.88]  people.
[3271.98 --> 3272.58]  That's not fun.
[3273.58 --> 3274.22]  No, it's not.
[3274.48 --> 3275.16]  We'll find a way.
[3276.48 --> 3277.12]  Overnight Costco
[3277.12 --> 3277.46]  challenge?
[3277.56 --> 3277.78]  No.
[3278.50 --> 3279.08]  Correct the Wi-Fi?
[3279.22 --> 3279.52]  No.
[3279.52 --> 3283.02]  Secret shop?
[3283.14 --> 3283.28]  No.
[3283.38 --> 3284.12]  But see, he just
[3284.12 --> 3284.82]  said it can't be
[3284.82 --> 3285.02]  work.
[3285.10 --> 3285.62]  And you guys are
[3285.62 --> 3286.54]  now picking work
[3286.54 --> 3286.74]  stuff.
[3286.96 --> 3287.70]  So it has to be
[3287.70 --> 3288.98]  not work stuff.
[3290.38 --> 3291.14]  We'll find a way
[3291.14 --> 3291.36]  though.
[3291.72 --> 3292.16]  It's all right.
[3292.64 --> 3293.68]  We just see in order
[3293.68 --> 3294.26]  to find a way you
[3294.26 --> 3294.76]  have to know the
[3294.76 --> 3295.06]  rules.
[3295.26 --> 3295.92]  In order to know
[3295.92 --> 3296.50]  the rules, you have
[3296.50 --> 3297.40]  to almost break
[3297.40 --> 3297.62]  them.
[3297.88 --> 3298.60]  And then it's fine.
[3298.84 --> 3299.54]  So we're doing
[3299.54 --> 3299.82]  good.
[3299.92 --> 3300.52]  We're progressing.
[3300.78 --> 3300.92]  Yeah.
[3300.92 --> 3301.48]  It's like tax
[3301.48 --> 3301.90]  evasion.
[3303.76 --> 3304.12]  Sorry.
[3304.20 --> 3304.98]  Tax avoidance.
[3307.74 --> 3308.10]  Yeah.
[3308.10 --> 3309.90]  Don't do crimes
[3309.90 --> 3310.52]  on company
[3310.52 --> 3311.02]  times.
[3314.10 --> 3314.58]  Okay.
[3315.58 --> 3316.50]  We'll find a way.
[3316.68 --> 3317.70]  Speaking of crimes,
[3317.88 --> 3318.50]  how about some
[3318.50 --> 3318.96]  announcements?
[3321.60 --> 3322.32]  I don't know.
[3322.40 --> 3323.06]  I'm getting worse
[3323.06 --> 3323.80]  at these segues.
[3324.20 --> 3324.68]  It's late.
[3324.76 --> 3325.40]  The earlier one
[3325.40 --> 3326.02]  was pretty good.
[3326.18 --> 3327.16]  That one was...
[3327.16 --> 3327.74]  Yeah, you only
[3327.74 --> 3328.32]  get one.
[3328.80 --> 3329.20]  Rough.
[3329.70 --> 3329.98]  Yeah.
[3330.76 --> 3331.60]  Okay, what are we
[3331.60 --> 3332.18]  supposed to be doing
[3332.18 --> 3332.48]  now?
[3333.30 --> 3333.74]  Crimes?
[3334.08 --> 3334.84]  I mean announcements.
[3336.78 --> 3337.72]  Oh, right.
[3337.88 --> 3338.08]  Okay.
[3338.10 --> 3339.28]  What if we went to
[3339.28 --> 3342.00]  Costco to acquire
[3342.00 --> 3344.22]  stuff that makes
[3344.22 --> 3345.36]  their area cooler
[3345.36 --> 3347.16]  so they like their
[3347.16 --> 3347.84]  workspace more?
[3349.22 --> 3350.34]  You are basically
[3350.34 --> 3352.12]  just copying my
[3352.12 --> 3353.38]  ThinkGeek order idea
[3353.38 --> 3354.64]  from like 10 years
[3354.64 --> 3354.96]  ago.
[3355.10 --> 3355.42]  Well, no.
[3355.54 --> 3356.12]  Why don't you just
[3356.12 --> 3357.36]  go back to the
[3357.36 --> 3359.12]  lounge and play games
[3359.12 --> 3359.44]  or something?
[3359.44 --> 3360.34]  This was Nick's idea
[3360.34 --> 3360.80]  where he was
[3360.80 --> 3361.60]  considering we
[3361.60 --> 3362.54]  changed the event
[3362.54 --> 3363.28]  from going to Costco
[3363.28 --> 3364.30]  to going to Home
[3364.30 --> 3364.52]  Depot.
[3364.52 --> 3364.60]  Costco.
[3365.80 --> 3366.64]  But I was like,
[3366.72 --> 3367.30]  ah, but everyone
[3367.30 --> 3367.98]  voted for Costco
[3367.98 --> 3368.54]  so we got to find
[3368.54 --> 3368.98]  a way for that
[3368.98 --> 3369.28]  to work.
[3370.00 --> 3370.50]  But Costco
[3370.50 --> 3371.14]  could still work
[3371.14 --> 3371.56]  for that.
[3371.94 --> 3372.56]  It might not
[3372.56 --> 3373.14]  be as good.
[3373.14 --> 3375.52]  Look, I literally
[3375.52 --> 3377.46]  stepped down as CEO
[3377.46 --> 3379.06]  so that I wouldn't
[3379.06 --> 3379.90]  have to do this
[3379.90 --> 3380.28]  anymore.
[3380.82 --> 3381.62]  And then I found
[3381.62 --> 3382.20]  a way.
[3382.20 --> 3383.72]  so that I wouldn't
[3383.72 --> 3384.80]  have to deal with
[3384.80 --> 3385.42]  this kind of
[3385.42 --> 3386.30]  slippery slope
[3386.30 --> 3387.46]  bullcrap anymore.
[3389.92 --> 3391.92]  Because the second
[3391.92 --> 3392.98]  you guys go to
[3392.98 --> 3394.28]  Costco, someone
[3394.28 --> 3395.10]  else is like,
[3395.28 --> 3396.36]  OK, well, then we
[3396.36 --> 3396.94]  should be allowed to
[3396.94 --> 3397.68]  go to Safeway
[3397.68 --> 3398.66]  again.
[3398.84 --> 3400.08]  But they did it.
[3400.30 --> 3401.08]  It's because you
[3401.08 --> 3401.84]  went to Safeway
[3401.84 --> 3402.74]  that we had to make
[3402.74 --> 3403.26]  this rule in the
[3403.26 --> 3403.60]  first place.
[3403.96 --> 3405.00]  Every rule exists
[3405.00 --> 3405.74]  because someone
[3405.74 --> 3406.82]  tried to abuse it.
[3406.82 --> 3407.32]  Mm hmm.
[3407.32 --> 3407.68]  Mm hmm.
[3407.68 --> 3408.10]  Mm hmm.
[3408.10 --> 3408.78]  Mm hmm.
[3408.78 --> 3409.28]  Mm hmm.
[3409.28 --> 3409.60]  Mm hmm.
[3409.60 --> 3409.88]  Mm hmm.
[3409.88 --> 3411.68]  And literally it is
[3411.68 --> 3413.06]  for your protection.
[3413.06 --> 3414.24]  It is for your
[3414.24 --> 3415.12]  protection that we
[3415.12 --> 3415.96]  have these rules,
[3415.96 --> 3417.62]  because if you go
[3417.62 --> 3418.72]  and you spend
[3418.72 --> 3419.64]  two hundred dollars
[3419.64 --> 3420.42]  of company money
[3420.42 --> 3421.74]  at Costco, you
[3421.74 --> 3422.50]  owe somewhere
[3422.50 --> 3423.92]  between 50 and
[3423.92 --> 3425.06]  80 dollars,
[3425.20 --> 3425.74]  depending on your
[3425.74 --> 3426.90]  tax bracket, an
[3426.90 --> 3427.86]  income tax on it.
[3427.94 --> 3429.30]  And I know you
[3429.30 --> 3429.94]  ain't going to pay
[3429.94 --> 3430.22]  it.
[3430.62 --> 3431.18]  So.
[3432.58 --> 3433.54]  This is very
[3433.54 --> 3433.88]  meta.
[3436.84 --> 3437.68]  Check your phone.
[3437.78 --> 3438.30]  I bet Taryn's
[3438.30 --> 3438.68]  calling you.
[3438.78 --> 3439.62]  I bet Taryn thinks
[3439.62 --> 3440.22]  this is funny.
[3441.68 --> 3442.74]  I bet he does.
[3442.84 --> 3443.50]  But I bet Taryn
[3443.50 --> 3445.04]  also takes his
[3445.04 --> 3446.56]  job of making
[3446.56 --> 3447.20]  sure we're doing
[3447.20 --> 3447.88]  things properly
[3447.88 --> 3448.38]  seriously.
[3448.78 --> 3449.94]  No, I agree to
[3449.94 --> 3450.62]  the point where I
[3450.62 --> 3451.70]  will either find a
[3451.70 --> 3452.30]  way that we can do
[3452.30 --> 3452.82]  this legitimately
[3452.82 --> 3454.26]  or we won't.
[3454.26 --> 3455.28]  Like, I'm not
[3455.28 --> 3455.94]  going to actually
[3455.94 --> 3456.72]  just like do it
[3456.72 --> 3458.58]  wrong, but I do
[3458.58 --> 3459.02]  find.
[3459.16 --> 3459.54]  Thank you.
[3459.74 --> 3460.62]  I do find the
[3460.62 --> 3462.60]  idea of like trying
[3462.60 --> 3463.46]  to find a way to
[3463.46 --> 3464.12]  do this legitimately
[3464.12 --> 3465.34]  to be fun and
[3465.34 --> 3465.98]  entertaining and
[3465.98 --> 3466.26]  cool.
[3466.76 --> 3467.62]  I'm just admitting
[3467.62 --> 3468.06]  that.
[3468.66 --> 3469.28]  But I mean, yeah,
[3469.30 --> 3469.96]  if we can't do it,
[3469.96 --> 3470.82]  we can't do it.
[3470.82 --> 3472.00]  Um, like it's,
[3472.06 --> 3472.50]  it's funny.
[3472.64 --> 3473.30]  It's because like
[3473.30 --> 3474.84]  in most cases,
[3474.84 --> 3475.70]  our company policy
[3475.70 --> 3476.78]  is because we
[3476.78 --> 3478.16]  have explored and
[3478.16 --> 3479.06]  exhausted every
[3479.06 --> 3480.42]  possible option.
[3480.76 --> 3481.68]  Like we have
[3481.68 --> 3482.52]  wanted to do
[3482.52 --> 3483.88]  things like, you
[3483.88 --> 3485.56]  know, giant gas
[3485.56 --> 3488.24]  gift cards, um, as
[3488.24 --> 3488.88]  whether it's like
[3488.88 --> 3490.10]  prizes or incentives
[3490.10 --> 3490.84]  or bonuses or
[3490.84 --> 3491.12]  whatever.
[3491.12 --> 3491.78]  And what we've run
[3491.78 --> 3492.50]  up against every
[3492.50 --> 3494.34]  time is that the
[3494.34 --> 3495.42]  CRA has seen
[3495.42 --> 3498.10]  this grift and, uh,
[3498.10 --> 3499.02]  is wise to it
[3499.02 --> 3500.02]  because the only
[3500.02 --> 3501.38]  reason to do it
[3501.38 --> 3502.60]  this way would
[3502.60 --> 3503.28]  be so that you
[3503.28 --> 3504.42]  can use pre
[3504.42 --> 3505.36]  personal income
[3505.36 --> 3506.76]  tax money for
[3506.76 --> 3508.14]  the employee for
[3508.14 --> 3508.72]  them to get a
[3508.72 --> 3509.50]  benefit that would
[3509.50 --> 3510.68]  normally be post
[3510.68 --> 3511.80]  income tax.
[3511.92 --> 3512.12]  Right.
[3512.70 --> 3513.54]  Um, so if
[3513.54 --> 3514.96]  someone is going
[3514.96 --> 3516.44]  to Costco for
[3516.44 --> 3517.58]  our company outing
[3517.58 --> 3518.38]  and just like
[3518.38 --> 3519.48]  buys a blender
[3519.48 --> 3521.36]  and the company
[3521.36 --> 3523.64]  event is buying a
[3523.64 --> 3525.44]  blender, the CRA is
[3525.44 --> 3525.92]  going to look at
[3525.92 --> 3526.50]  this, you're
[3526.50 --> 3526.90]  going to be like,
[3527.06 --> 3528.86]  okay, so I'm
[3528.86 --> 3529.18]  going to need
[3529.18 --> 3530.00]  income tax
[3530.00 --> 3531.10]  payments from all
[3531.10 --> 3531.94]  of y'all on your
[3531.94 --> 3532.78]  blender purchases.
[3533.72 --> 3535.24]  So we have these
[3535.24 --> 3536.82]  policies so that
[3536.82 --> 3539.40]  you guys don't get
[3539.40 --> 3540.32]  bent over by the
[3540.32 --> 3541.56]  tax man after the
[3541.56 --> 3541.94]  fact.
[3542.10 --> 3542.94]  It's so that we're
[3542.94 --> 3543.58]  making sure we're
[3543.58 --> 3544.28]  doing everything on
[3544.28 --> 3545.06]  the up and up in
[3545.06 --> 3546.40]  the first place and
[3546.40 --> 3547.04]  we don't run into
[3547.04 --> 3547.88]  trouble after the
[3547.88 --> 3548.94]  fact because once you
[3548.94 --> 3549.90]  owe interest on it
[3549.90 --> 3550.52]  and potential
[3550.52 --> 3551.96]  penalties, it's a
[3551.96 --> 3552.58]  lot worse.
[3554.76 --> 3555.20]  Hmm.
[3555.92 --> 3558.48]  I have rules
[3558.48 --> 3559.52]  because I care.
[3561.06 --> 3561.58]  Hmm.
[3563.62 --> 3564.66]  Why don't we do
[3564.66 --> 3565.46]  some announcements?
[3565.98 --> 3566.78]  And I will attempt
[3566.78 --> 3567.84]  to get us to Costco
[3567.84 --> 3568.98]  because I care.
[3570.70 --> 3572.18]  I think Luke just
[3572.18 --> 3573.32]  buys snacks for an
[3573.32 --> 3574.34]  event at the
[3574.34 --> 3574.70]  lounge.
[3578.24 --> 3579.42]  I will leave it to
[3579.42 --> 3580.20]  you guys to figure
[3580.20 --> 3580.42]  out.
[3580.62 --> 3581.82]  Introducing the
[3581.82 --> 3583.48]  hooded task jacket.
[3583.48 --> 3585.52]  these have a fun
[3585.52 --> 3586.22]  story to them.
[3586.52 --> 3587.58]  We ordered a whole
[3587.58 --> 3588.76]  bunch of this twill
[3588.76 --> 3590.44]  woven material which
[3590.44 --> 3591.42]  was supposed to be
[3591.42 --> 3592.96]  used for our tech
[3592.96 --> 3593.92]  pants which we were
[3593.92 --> 3595.82]  developing years ago.
[3596.64 --> 3598.08]  Well, they didn't end
[3598.08 --> 3598.68]  up being the right
[3598.68 --> 3600.88]  choice for pants but
[3600.88 --> 3602.62]  they were perfect for
[3602.62 --> 3604.10]  a jacket that is
[3604.10 --> 3605.22]  perfect for getting
[3605.22 --> 3605.80]  stuff done.
[3605.80 --> 3607.30]  It's built for those
[3607.30 --> 3608.86]  awkward spring days when
[3608.86 --> 3609.92]  it's still too chilly for
[3609.92 --> 3611.68]  a t-shirt but too warm
[3611.68 --> 3613.44]  for a jacket and you
[3613.44 --> 3614.40]  can either layer it
[3614.40 --> 3615.62]  over a sweater or
[3615.62 --> 3616.92]  rock it solo with the
[3616.92 --> 3617.78]  inner lining feeling
[3617.78 --> 3618.94]  great on your skin if
[3618.94 --> 3619.76]  you're just wearing a
[3619.76 --> 3620.34]  t-shirt underneath.
[3621.40 --> 3623.12]  And, of course, in
[3623.12 --> 3624.18]  classic LTT fashion,
[3624.58 --> 3625.54]  it's loaded up with
[3625.54 --> 3626.80]  three zippered pockets
[3626.80 --> 3627.54]  to secure all your
[3627.54 --> 3628.76]  stuff, an embroidered
[3628.76 --> 3629.62]  LTT logo on the
[3629.62 --> 3631.08]  sleeve, and custom
[3631.08 --> 3632.22]  LTT cord locks.
[3632.22 --> 3633.54]  It's available now at
[3633.54 --> 3636.24]  lmg.gg slash task
[3636.24 --> 3636.76]  jacket.
[3637.14 --> 3637.92]  And, Luke, if you
[3637.92 --> 3638.58]  want to show some of
[3638.58 --> 3640.32]  the fun photos at that
[3640.32 --> 3641.60]  link on your screen,
[3641.66 --> 3642.18]  that would be great.
[3642.26 --> 3643.04]  And, Dan, you're also
[3643.04 --> 3643.64]  wearing one, right?
[3643.74 --> 3644.42]  Sorry, your guys'
[3644.70 --> 3645.68]  preview window is
[3645.68 --> 3646.84]  extremely small for me.
[3646.86 --> 3647.52]  It's very comfy.
[3649.68 --> 3650.84]  I'm excited to do
[3650.84 --> 3651.88]  tasks in this.
[3652.82 --> 3653.46]  Do you want to show
[3653.46 --> 3654.68]  the website pictures?
[3655.10 --> 3655.58]  Luke, do you want to
[3655.58 --> 3655.94]  pull that up?
[3656.12 --> 3656.48]  Sure.
[3656.74 --> 3657.92]  Give me one second.
[3657.92 --> 3659.28]  Let's see the store.
[3660.70 --> 3661.54]  Yeah, this is great.
[3661.68 --> 3661.78]  Look.
[3662.22 --> 3664.16]  W. Calderini, who
[3664.16 --> 3665.76]  says, jackets, just in
[3665.76 --> 3666.46]  time for summer.
[3667.30 --> 3668.80]  We release products
[3668.80 --> 3669.52]  when they're ready.
[3669.80 --> 3670.68]  That's what people say
[3670.68 --> 3671.18]  they want.
[3672.06 --> 3672.70]  So, whatever.
[3673.68 --> 3675.18]  Not at Costco yet,
[3675.26 --> 3675.82]  unfortunately.
[3679.62 --> 3680.60]  Wow, it's actually an
[3680.60 --> 3681.20]  epic photo.
[3683.62 --> 3684.82]  He's doing tasks.
[3685.16 --> 3686.06]  They're doing tasks,
[3686.20 --> 3686.72]  guys, okay?
[3687.04 --> 3687.34]  Yeah.
[3687.34 --> 3688.26]  This is how you get
[3688.26 --> 3689.04]  tasks done.
[3690.58 --> 3691.76]  I understand you need
[3691.76 --> 3692.72]  to have a
[3692.72 --> 3694.94]  black version of
[3694.94 --> 3695.54]  everything, and the
[3695.54 --> 3696.14]  black version looks
[3696.14 --> 3696.40]  great.
[3696.56 --> 3697.90]  Like, I like it, but
[3697.90 --> 3699.60]  it feels like the
[3699.60 --> 3701.08]  like, canon color for
[3701.08 --> 3702.26]  this jacket is the
[3702.26 --> 3703.02]  brown.
[3704.18 --> 3705.30]  Like, the brown looks
[3705.30 --> 3706.22]  so good.
[3707.70 --> 3708.84]  The black is solid,
[3709.30 --> 3710.72]  but the brown looks so
[3710.72 --> 3711.04]  good.
[3711.04 --> 3716.22]  Heck yeah.
[3716.22 --> 3717.86]  All right.
[3718.18 --> 3719.34]  In other announcements,
[3720.44 --> 3723.14]  LTTX Larian Studios
[3723.14 --> 3723.70]  backpack.
[3723.72 --> 3724.46]  Let's go!
[3724.80 --> 3726.24]  Plus giveaway.
[3727.90 --> 3728.40]  All right, do we get
[3728.40 --> 3728.98]  some of you might have
[3728.98 --> 3729.34]  noticed.
[3729.54 --> 3730.12]  Should we get them on
[3730.12 --> 3730.40]  the table?
[3730.40 --> 3730.64]  Reddit?
[3732.00 --> 3733.00]  Yeah, I guess so.
[3733.54 --> 3734.36]  Some of you might have
[3734.36 --> 3735.42]  noticed on Twitter or
[3735.42 --> 3736.90]  Reddit that user
[3736.90 --> 3739.08]  Cromwelp posted Larian
[3739.08 --> 3740.54]  Studios' new backpack.
[3740.76 --> 3741.40]  Actually, do you want to
[3741.40 --> 3742.82]  bring up the post first?
[3743.24 --> 3743.76]  Sure.
[3743.76 --> 3748.26]  We partnered with Larian
[3748.26 --> 3749.68]  Studios, makers of
[3749.68 --> 3751.54]  Baldur's Gate 3, to
[3751.54 --> 3754.30]  produce about 800 of
[3754.30 --> 3755.44]  these bags for their
[3755.44 --> 3757.34]  entire staff, featuring
[3757.34 --> 3759.40]  a custom design on the
[3759.40 --> 3761.52]  front pouch, a Larian
[3761.52 --> 3763.34]  Studios patch on the
[3763.34 --> 3765.94]  side pocket, and a
[3765.94 --> 3767.98]  custom interior lining.
[3768.18 --> 3768.92]  Let's go back to the
[3768.92 --> 3769.88]  wide of Luke, and he can
[3769.88 --> 3770.70]  show off the patch.
[3770.84 --> 3771.88]  Oh, beautiful.
[3771.88 --> 3774.08]  And the custom lining.
[3775.10 --> 3775.54]  There's...
[3775.54 --> 3776.50]  All you have to do to
[3776.50 --> 3776.94]  get one.
[3777.26 --> 3777.98]  There's kind of multiple
[3777.98 --> 3778.94]  parts to the custom
[3778.94 --> 3779.98]  lining, so...
[3779.98 --> 3780.34]  Oh, sure.
[3780.44 --> 3780.50]  Go.
[3780.74 --> 3783.86]  The first off, in the
[3783.86 --> 3786.42]  big, like, pocket of
[3786.42 --> 3788.24]  holding area, there's
[3788.24 --> 3788.88]  another...
[3788.88 --> 3789.68]  It's a little hard to
[3789.68 --> 3790.12]  show, but there's
[3790.12 --> 3791.92]  another, like, badge.
[3792.60 --> 3794.98]  And then the printing...
[3794.98 --> 3795.70]  You could switch to the
[3795.70 --> 3796.34]  Luke cam, Luke.
[3796.60 --> 3797.26]  Just an idea.
[3799.86 --> 3800.08]  Huh.
[3801.06 --> 3801.50]  Nice.
[3802.88 --> 3803.76]  Questionable levels of
[3803.76 --> 3804.08]  success.
[3804.22 --> 3805.12]  There's also a lot of
[3805.12 --> 3806.22]  boxes in the way now.
[3807.28 --> 3807.88]  Maybe we can...
[3807.88 --> 3808.14]  Uh, okay.
[3808.24 --> 3809.78]  Well, it's a black
[3809.78 --> 3810.68]  screen for me, so you
[3810.68 --> 3811.30]  might want to just go
[3811.30 --> 3811.94]  back to the live.
[3812.66 --> 3813.10]  Uh-oh.
[3814.18 --> 3814.90]  Uh-oh.
[3815.90 --> 3816.66]  So that's...
[3816.66 --> 3817.56]  That's the Luke cam
[3817.56 --> 3817.96]  right now.
[3818.08 --> 3818.66]  Very helpful.
[3819.06 --> 3819.42]  Nice.
[3819.78 --> 3820.52]  That's the line.
[3820.64 --> 3820.72]  Nice.
[3820.72 --> 3821.50]  Great job, everyone.
[3821.62 --> 3822.52]  Show it this way.
[3822.62 --> 3823.32]  There we go.
[3824.78 --> 3825.14]  Nice.
[3825.30 --> 3826.04]  Back to the Luke cam.
[3826.14 --> 3826.88]  Okay, hold on.
[3827.74 --> 3828.48]  No, no, that was good.
[3828.48 --> 3829.04]  Professional production
[3829.04 --> 3830.42]  company, everyone.
[3830.42 --> 3831.32]  Okay.
[3831.48 --> 3832.02]  There we go.
[3832.54 --> 3832.94]  Fine.
[3833.90 --> 3834.30]  There's...
[3834.30 --> 3834.98]  So there's the inside.
[3835.30 --> 3835.90]  So you've got another
[3835.90 --> 3836.52]  Larian badge.
[3836.66 --> 3837.82]  It's like this gray
[3837.82 --> 3838.74]  instead of the orange.
[3839.18 --> 3840.30]  And these logos in the
[3840.30 --> 3840.94]  background, you might
[3840.94 --> 3842.22]  notice they're not all
[3842.22 --> 3843.74]  the same as the
[3843.74 --> 3844.90]  standard badge one.
[3845.10 --> 3845.86]  And that's because it's
[3845.86 --> 3846.50]  their localized
[3846.50 --> 3848.24]  studios logos.
[3849.24 --> 3849.88]  So they have studios
[3849.88 --> 3850.54]  all over the world,
[3850.54 --> 3851.46]  and these are the logos
[3851.46 --> 3852.32]  for the individual studios,
[3852.38 --> 3853.26]  which is super cool.
[3853.26 --> 3857.74]  Another cool secret of the
[3857.74 --> 3861.04]  inside of the bag is the
[3861.04 --> 3862.48]  what I'm going to call the
[3862.48 --> 3863.90]  combined works logo, but I
[3863.90 --> 3864.48]  don't know what you would
[3864.48 --> 3865.58]  want to actually call this,
[3865.98 --> 3867.10]  but it looks so sick.
[3867.20 --> 3867.76]  I don't know why.
[3867.86 --> 3869.08]  It's so simple, but I just
[3869.08 --> 3869.74]  like it a lot.
[3870.48 --> 3871.12]  Look at that.
[3874.06 --> 3874.94]  Isn't it just sick?
[3875.00 --> 3876.66]  It's just LGTX Larian, but I
[3876.66 --> 3877.38]  think it looks great.
[3878.64 --> 3879.52]  It's beautiful.
[3879.52 --> 3881.12]  And all you have to do to
[3881.12 --> 3883.20]  get one is go back in time
[3883.20 --> 3884.86]  and get a job at Larian.
[3885.22 --> 3885.82]  This is embossed.
[3885.82 --> 3886.40]  And work on Baldur's Gate
[3886.40 --> 3886.66]  3.
[3889.14 --> 3890.18]  I think you mean
[3890.18 --> 3890.60]  embroidered.
[3890.76 --> 3891.16]  Embroidered.
[3891.24 --> 3892.00]  That is what I mean.
[3892.60 --> 3893.92]  I say the wrong words often.
[3895.10 --> 3895.80]  Yep, that's fine.
[3895.88 --> 3896.14]  I know.
[3897.28 --> 3899.16]  Or you can be Luke, who
[3899.16 --> 3900.22]  gets one of the backpacks.
[3901.60 --> 3903.04]  Wait, who gets 11
[3903.04 --> 3903.70]  backpacks?
[3903.70 --> 3904.16]  Ha ha!
[3906.36 --> 3906.80]  Luke?
[3906.80 --> 3909.42]  I don't think you need
[3909.42 --> 3910.46]  11 backpacks.
[3910.88 --> 3912.80]  So, I'll make you a deal.
[3913.24 --> 3913.58]  Okay.
[3913.76 --> 3914.94]  You can keep one.
[3915.52 --> 3915.88]  Okay.
[3916.24 --> 3917.32]  And we'll give away the
[3917.32 --> 3917.86]  other 10.
[3919.06 --> 3920.00]  So, if you guys are
[3920.00 --> 3921.90]  feeling lucky, there may
[3921.90 --> 3923.50]  be something on
[3923.50 --> 3925.28]  LTTstore.com that will
[3925.28 --> 3926.50]  take you where you need
[3926.50 --> 3928.28]  to go to enter this
[3928.28 --> 3928.84]  giveaway.
[3929.52 --> 3931.30]  Maybe near something that
[3931.30 --> 3932.28]  has your back.
[3933.04 --> 3934.08]  We're going to be drawing
[3934.08 --> 3935.82]  winners next Friday, so
[3935.82 --> 3936.80]  make sure to keep your
[3936.80 --> 3938.62]  eyes out and enter
[3938.62 --> 3939.82]  before then.
[3941.20 --> 3942.06]  Pretty exciting.
[3943.96 --> 3944.20]  Okay.
[3945.20 --> 3946.48]  And I would just like to
[3946.48 --> 3948.62]  say thank you, Larry and
[3948.62 --> 3949.78]  Studios, for your
[3949.78 --> 3951.68]  patience on this project.
[3952.82 --> 3954.04]  Because of some of our
[3954.04 --> 3954.98]  issues with backpack
[3954.98 --> 3956.26]  suppliers and backpack
[3956.26 --> 3959.76]  production, it took a
[3959.76 --> 3961.12]  very long time to
[3961.12 --> 3962.52]  deliver these backpacks.
[3962.52 --> 3964.72]  But I had an idea, Luke.
[3964.78 --> 3966.10]  I pitched this to Taryn.
[3966.56 --> 3968.28]  I was thinking that, you
[3968.28 --> 3969.98]  know, if we ever wanted
[3969.98 --> 3971.20]  them to work with us
[3971.20 --> 3972.74]  again, maybe what we
[3972.74 --> 3974.08]  could do is we could
[3974.08 --> 3976.60]  document a start date and
[3976.60 --> 3977.98]  come up with like an idea
[3977.98 --> 3979.34]  for something and then
[3979.34 --> 3980.26]  send them a timeline.
[3980.48 --> 3981.46]  Send them, basically send
[3981.46 --> 3982.58]  it to them unsolicited.
[3982.70 --> 3983.56]  Be like, okay, here's a
[3983.56 --> 3985.02]  thing that we made.
[3985.42 --> 3986.30]  Here was the entire
[3986.30 --> 3988.34]  timeline from concept to
[3988.34 --> 3989.38]  sending you these units.
[3989.38 --> 3992.56]  If this is acceptable, let
[3992.56 --> 3993.58]  us know and maybe we'll
[3993.58 --> 3995.06]  work together again.
[3995.76 --> 3995.96]  Yeah.
[3996.42 --> 3999.50]  They were spectacularly
[3999.50 --> 4001.26]  patient and amazing to
[4001.26 --> 4001.58]  work on this.
[4001.58 --> 4002.60]  They were very patient,
[4002.74 --> 4003.00]  yeah.
[4003.98 --> 4004.30]  Yes.
[4005.14 --> 4008.50]  But basically, the final
[4008.50 --> 4009.58]  backpacks that they got
[4009.58 --> 4011.68]  are not from the same
[4011.68 --> 4013.40]  supplier that the sample
[4013.40 --> 4014.42]  backpacks were from
[4014.42 --> 4015.58]  because it was no longer
[4015.58 --> 4016.98]  possible to get them from
[4016.98 --> 4017.96]  the original supplier.
[4017.96 --> 4019.40]  But that does also mean
[4019.40 --> 4021.20]  that they have the nice
[4021.20 --> 4022.38]  dual layer bottoms and
[4022.38 --> 4023.10]  they have the corrected
[4023.10 --> 4024.20]  carabiners and all that
[4024.20 --> 4024.74]  kind of stuff.
[4025.58 --> 4025.94]  Yes.
[4025.96 --> 4026.80]  So they're in a good
[4026.80 --> 4027.24]  state.
[4029.02 --> 4030.68]  Bots asks, are custom
[4030.68 --> 4031.90]  backpacks a possibility if
[4031.90 --> 4032.56]  we order that many?
[4032.64 --> 4033.36]  I mean, anything's a
[4033.36 --> 4034.38]  possibility if you order
[4034.38 --> 4034.70]  enough.
[4035.66 --> 4038.24]  800 bags was enough for
[4038.24 --> 4039.18]  us to make something
[4039.18 --> 4039.72]  happen here.
[4039.86 --> 4041.18]  And I think we could get
[4041.18 --> 4043.08]  it done a lot faster if
[4043.08 --> 4044.18]  we were to do it again.
[4044.18 --> 4047.68]  We have a much larger,
[4048.22 --> 4050.56]  much more engaged
[4050.56 --> 4051.98]  partner on the backpack
[4051.98 --> 4053.24]  manufacturing side right
[4053.24 --> 4053.46]  now.
[4053.90 --> 4055.46]  With that said, there are
[4055.46 --> 4055.98]  going to be some
[4055.98 --> 4057.76]  challenges with all of
[4057.76 --> 4059.06]  the tariff situations
[4059.06 --> 4060.34]  that are going on in the
[4060.34 --> 4061.08]  world right now.
[4062.48 --> 4063.12]  So who knows?
[4063.72 --> 4065.02]  You know, the world's
[4065.02 --> 4066.42]  wild right now.
[4066.58 --> 4068.32]  Like, I was talking to a
[4068.32 --> 4070.82]  PC case company that was
[4070.82 --> 4071.92]  like, yeah, we're trying
[4071.92 --> 4073.36]  to get some cases over
[4073.36 --> 4074.86]  here before some new
[4074.86 --> 4075.82]  tariffs get applied to
[4075.82 --> 4076.08]  them.
[4076.28 --> 4077.92]  And what we realized is
[4077.92 --> 4080.18]  that even if we could get
[4080.18 --> 4081.38]  an order in, there's no
[4081.38 --> 4082.12]  way we could get it in
[4082.12 --> 4083.06]  time because everybody
[4083.06 --> 4083.82]  thought of that.
[4084.22 --> 4085.74]  And the ports are like
[4085.74 --> 4088.32]  swamped, absolutely
[4088.32 --> 4089.96]  mired in shipments right
[4089.96 --> 4090.18]  now.
[4090.86 --> 4091.96]  This is from a single
[4091.96 --> 4093.06]  source, so take it for
[4093.06 --> 4093.62]  what it is.
[4093.72 --> 4095.46]  But logistics right now,
[4095.88 --> 4097.28]  apparently very
[4097.28 --> 4097.80]  challenging.
[4099.02 --> 4099.42]  Yeah.
[4100.02 --> 4100.74]  It makes sense.
[4100.82 --> 4101.14]  All right.
[4101.14 --> 4102.28]  What are we supposed to
[4102.28 --> 4102.88]  be talking about?
[4103.44 --> 4104.24]  Luke, you want to pick a
[4104.24 --> 4104.44]  topic?
[4104.90 --> 4105.68]  No, we've got to do some
[4105.68 --> 4106.40]  merch messages.
[4107.26 --> 4107.52]  Yeah.
[4108.04 --> 4108.40]  Okay.
[4108.60 --> 4109.40]  I'm going to have to rely
[4109.40 --> 4110.62]  on you guys to kind of do
[4110.62 --> 4111.48]  that because I didn't
[4111.48 --> 4112.22]  remember to set up the
[4112.22 --> 4112.52]  dashboard.
[4112.76 --> 4114.38]  So, cool.
[4115.84 --> 4116.18]  Yeah.
[4116.88 --> 4118.12]  Well, let's see.
[4119.24 --> 4120.98]  I think I've got one here
[4120.98 --> 4122.20]  for Mr.
[4123.20 --> 4123.60]  Luke.
[4124.36 --> 4125.56]  Hi, Parasocial friends.
[4125.66 --> 4126.72]  I recently got promoted to
[4126.72 --> 4127.94]  lead software engineer.
[4128.18 --> 4129.30]  I want to build an awesome
[4129.30 --> 4131.18]  team, but my DRs are all
[4131.18 --> 4131.78]  over the world.
[4132.16 --> 4133.32]  Got any advice on how to
[4133.32 --> 4134.46]  build a strong team
[4134.46 --> 4134.84]  remotely?
[4136.64 --> 4137.00]  DRs.
[4137.08 --> 4138.08]  Oh, direct reports.
[4139.32 --> 4140.58]  I don't know why, but I
[4140.58 --> 4141.56]  don't think people have
[4141.56 --> 4143.70]  shortened that when talking
[4143.70 --> 4145.24]  to me before, but I get it.
[4145.24 --> 4145.84]  Direct reports.
[4150.36 --> 4152.08]  It can be really complicated
[4152.08 --> 4154.54]  if you cross certain time
[4154.54 --> 4154.84]  zones.
[4155.04 --> 4157.46]  I find for our group, we
[4157.46 --> 4159.40]  have all of North America
[4159.40 --> 4163.56]  and we have Europe and that
[4163.56 --> 4165.86]  works pretty well because you
[4165.86 --> 4168.06]  set most of your crossover
[4168.06 --> 4173.58]  meeting times to be right at
[4173.58 --> 4175.62]  like around 9 a.m.
[4175.62 --> 4176.68]  because if I remember correctly,
[4176.78 --> 4180.84]  that's like 4-ish p.m.
[4181.14 --> 4184.90]  for like UK area and then it
[4184.90 --> 4185.56]  gets a little bit.
[4187.20 --> 4187.68]  Dang.
[4188.90 --> 4189.38]  Dang.
[4189.62 --> 4189.90]  Dang.
[4190.62 --> 4191.60]  Speed typing.
[4193.12 --> 4194.30]  How fast do you type,
[4194.40 --> 4194.58]  Linus?
[4194.60 --> 4195.52]  Have you tested yourself?
[4196.80 --> 4197.26]  What?
[4198.36 --> 4199.38]  It's very loud.
[4199.52 --> 4200.16]  Locked in.
[4201.20 --> 4202.28]  Oh, sorry.
[4202.50 --> 4202.96]  You can only hear you typing on
[4202.96 --> 4203.40]  the laptop.
[4203.40 --> 4205.56]  Sorry about that.
[4205.92 --> 4206.82]  Earthquake simulator.
[4207.84 --> 4208.24]  Okay.
[4208.86 --> 4209.46]  I'm done.
[4209.68 --> 4210.92]  I was just sending Dan a quick
[4210.92 --> 4211.30]  message.
[4211.60 --> 4211.98]  What was I?
[4212.08 --> 4214.18]  That completely dominated my
[4214.18 --> 4216.12]  brain functions.
[4216.86 --> 4217.54]  Oh, right.
[4217.62 --> 4217.92]  Yeah, yeah.
[4217.92 --> 4219.14]  So you meet at 9 a.m.
[4219.14 --> 4220.46]  and it works pretty well for
[4220.46 --> 4223.38]  most European areas and works
[4223.38 --> 4226.36]  pretty well for your North
[4228.32 --> 4229.36]  American areas as well.
[4229.36 --> 4234.30]  Other than that, like, I
[4234.30 --> 4235.12]  don't know, you're going to
[4235.12 --> 4236.30]  have to get pretty used to
[4236.30 --> 4237.78]  handoffs and check-ins.
[4239.34 --> 4241.56]  Ideally, you are hiring and
[4241.56 --> 4242.60]  working with a team of people
[4242.60 --> 4244.50]  that are pretty good at working
[4244.50 --> 4245.96]  alone unless your team is
[4245.96 --> 4251.00]  pretty big because it's it's
[4251.00 --> 4252.28]  often beneficial to have
[4252.28 --> 4253.88]  mixtures of disciplines across
[4253.88 --> 4254.76]  the time zones.
[4254.76 --> 4257.34]  Like one benefit that we have
[4257.34 --> 4259.56]  is that, you know, if you
[4259.56 --> 4261.34]  need someone of a certain if
[4261.34 --> 4263.22]  you have a large enough team
[4263.22 --> 4264.10]  and you need someone of a
[4264.10 --> 4264.96]  certain discipline, there's
[4264.96 --> 4265.84]  like kind of always someone
[4265.84 --> 4266.98]  online, which is nice.
[4267.08 --> 4268.32]  But that also means that those
[4268.32 --> 4269.46]  people aren't working with each
[4269.46 --> 4270.26]  other all the time.
[4270.78 --> 4272.20]  So sharing knowledge between
[4272.20 --> 4275.36]  those people and making sure
[4275.36 --> 4276.50]  that everyone's kind of staying
[4276.50 --> 4278.22]  same page can be more
[4278.22 --> 4278.66]  difficult.
[4278.66 --> 4281.00]  But like for for instance, my
[4281.00 --> 4283.32]  team, we meet twice a week for
[4283.32 --> 4284.70]  for an hour.
[4286.38 --> 4288.14]  We very rarely use the whole
[4288.14 --> 4288.50]  hour.
[4288.84 --> 4290.06]  I pick a part of the meeting
[4290.06 --> 4291.92]  where like once certain things
[4291.92 --> 4296.26]  have been accomplished, I say
[4296.26 --> 4297.84]  a generic phrase like have a
[4297.84 --> 4299.28]  good rest of your week or
[4299.28 --> 4299.70]  whatever.
[4299.90 --> 4301.58]  So everyone knows that like it's
[4301.58 --> 4302.82]  cool if they leave now.
[4302.98 --> 4304.34]  And then some teams.
[4305.26 --> 4307.52]  One of one of my teams, everyone
[4307.52 --> 4308.46]  just hangs up immediately.
[4308.66 --> 4310.98]  Another one of my teams, nobody
[4310.98 --> 4312.36]  leaves and everyone just hangs
[4312.36 --> 4313.82]  out in chats for the rest of
[4313.82 --> 4314.42]  the meeting time.
[4314.54 --> 4315.54]  Another one of my teams,
[4315.62 --> 4316.76]  everyone very formally says
[4316.76 --> 4317.20]  goodbye.
[4317.48 --> 4318.94]  Every team is very unique, but
[4318.94 --> 4320.94]  you can like allow for some
[4320.94 --> 4322.24]  space for people to hang out
[4322.24 --> 4323.30]  and talk so that you can have
[4323.30 --> 4324.44]  that team building stuff.
[4324.88 --> 4326.84]  I find that is more likely with
[4326.84 --> 4328.30]  remote teams that they will do
[4328.30 --> 4329.54]  that with local teams are like,
[4329.58 --> 4329.94]  I don't care.
[4330.02 --> 4330.84]  I'm going to see you in 10
[4330.84 --> 4331.40]  seconds anyways.
[4334.36 --> 4335.04]  I don't know.
[4335.14 --> 4335.82]  None of that was super
[4335.82 --> 4337.44]  specific advice, but find
[4337.44 --> 4338.64]  meeting times that everyone
[4338.64 --> 4340.44]  can actually do have multiple
[4340.44 --> 4342.20]  meetings per week, sync up
[4342.20 --> 4342.64]  often.
[4342.64 --> 4344.00]  And if you're having it where
[4344.00 --> 4345.04]  one person is working on
[4345.04 --> 4346.22]  something and then they have to
[4346.22 --> 4347.22]  hand off to the other person,
[4347.58 --> 4348.78]  standardize how that procedure
[4348.78 --> 4349.14]  works.
[4349.52 --> 4350.50]  Make a certain level of
[4350.50 --> 4352.06]  documentation required for the
[4352.06 --> 4353.46]  handoff and make a certain
[4353.46 --> 4355.26]  level of documentation or
[4355.26 --> 4357.16]  certain level of actually
[4357.16 --> 4358.10]  reading the documentation
[4358.10 --> 4359.52]  required for when they pick it
[4359.52 --> 4360.02]  up as well.
[4360.02 --> 4362.66]  Yeah, there you go.
[4364.16 --> 4364.76]  All right.
[4364.86 --> 4365.96]  And there's apparently
[4365.96 --> 4366.88]  announcement here for
[4366.88 --> 4368.10]  float plane that we're supposed
[4368.10 --> 4369.34]  to read after the first
[4369.34 --> 4370.28]  merch message.
[4371.40 --> 4374.36]  Oh, I just threw it.
[4374.36 --> 4374.98]  I don't see it.
[4376.30 --> 4377.36]  It's in the announcements.
[4378.08 --> 4378.36]  Yep.
[4378.36 --> 4382.58]  Oh, some of you had a keen eye on
[4382.58 --> 4384.72]  our AMD GPU review video, which
[4384.72 --> 4387.72]  yes, was partially shot at the
[4387.72 --> 4389.40]  Texas land house.
[4390.00 --> 4391.24]  Luke, do you want to screen share
[4391.24 --> 4392.26]  the Texas land house?
[4392.58 --> 4393.02]  Sure.
[4393.78 --> 4394.22]  Nope.
[4394.30 --> 4395.60]  We're apparently supposed to go to
[4395.60 --> 4396.86]  float plane and click around in
[4396.86 --> 4398.12]  the video while doing talking
[4398.12 --> 4398.50]  points.
[4398.90 --> 4401.52]  So the Texas land house went kind
[4401.52 --> 4402.62]  of viral on Reddit.
[4402.84 --> 4403.10]  Hold on.
[4403.16 --> 4403.52]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4403.56 --> 4404.42]  Isn't that the same thing?
[4404.48 --> 4405.44]  I'm supposed to show that, right?
[4405.44 --> 4406.26]  If we're clicking on the video,
[4406.30 --> 4407.00]  we're supposed to show it.
[4407.00 --> 4407.92]  Yeah, the link's there.
[4408.04 --> 4408.20]  Yeah.
[4408.70 --> 4408.94]  Yeah.
[4409.22 --> 4409.42]  Yeah.
[4409.98 --> 4412.18]  Well, I had meant show the viral
[4412.18 --> 4414.42]  Reddit post initially, but yeah,
[4414.46 --> 4415.46]  no, you should, you should show
[4415.46 --> 4415.82]  the video.
[4416.42 --> 4419.70]  So we did a tour of it and we've
[4419.70 --> 4422.12]  got an early sneak peek up on
[4422.12 --> 4423.44]  float plane right now.
[4423.68 --> 4425.72]  Got a few timestamps for Luke to
[4425.72 --> 4426.46]  show you guys.
[4427.00 --> 4427.86]  I am ready whenever.
[4428.74 --> 4430.70]  Starting at 617, which is the
[4430.70 --> 4432.66]  adult playroom.
[4433.00 --> 4433.80]  Throw it over there, Luke.
[4435.80 --> 4436.16]  Yeah.
[4437.00 --> 4438.68]  Do you want to hear it?
[4439.74 --> 4440.68]  I don't know.
[4441.60 --> 4442.26]  Let's go.
[4442.34 --> 4442.46]  No.
[4442.84 --> 4443.18]  Okay.
[4443.80 --> 4448.58]  At 1358, my son and Kenton open up
[4448.58 --> 4450.52]  the DDR gaming station.
[4450.98 --> 4452.48]  We talk about how Yvonne wants one.
[4453.02 --> 4455.80]  I think the final video that goes up
[4455.80 --> 4457.62]  on YouTube will be more of just like
[4457.62 --> 4458.88]  a tight scripted tour.
[4459.14 --> 4459.34]  Yeah.
[4459.40 --> 4461.88]  Whereas we got a ton of behind the
[4461.88 --> 4464.54]  scenes of just like Kenton showing us
[4464.54 --> 4464.86]  around.
[4464.86 --> 4465.96]  It's pretty cool.
[4466.32 --> 4469.22]  So there's four DDR pads built into
[4469.22 --> 4469.72]  the floor.
[4471.72 --> 4472.28]  1921.
[4474.92 --> 4479.20]  Shows the server rack full of gaming
[4479.20 --> 4479.70]  computers.
[4480.84 --> 4481.02]  Hmm.
[4482.50 --> 4483.28]  Oh, you'll find it.
[4483.34 --> 4483.88]  I went to 2020.
[4484.24 --> 4484.86]  My bad.
[4484.86 --> 4488.62]  So many gaming computers.
[4488.76 --> 4488.92]  Yeah.
[4488.92 --> 4490.62]  Those are all full like desktops,
[4490.68 --> 4490.80]  right?
[4491.94 --> 4492.48]  Oh, yeah.
[4492.82 --> 4493.02]  Yeah.
[4493.08 --> 4493.56]  Oh, yeah, bud.
[4493.72 --> 4494.02]  Crazy.
[4494.30 --> 4497.00]  They thought about using virtualization,
[4497.22 --> 4498.80]  but I think ran into a lot of the same
[4498.80 --> 4501.02]  challenges that I have in the past.
[4501.54 --> 4501.98]  Yeah.
[4502.14 --> 4504.08]  Anti-cheat doesn't like it at all.
[4504.40 --> 4504.60]  Yeah.
[4505.92 --> 4509.10]  3521 says actual GPU shooting.
[4509.28 --> 4510.56]  I don't know what that means.
[4511.12 --> 4511.48]  Yeah.
[4511.48 --> 4512.04]  Hold on.
[4512.32 --> 4513.00]  3521.
[4513.00 --> 4514.48]  Actual GPU shooting.
[4515.06 --> 4518.34]  Oh, the shooting of the GPU review
[4518.34 --> 4518.74]  video.
[4519.80 --> 4520.28]  Oh, yeah.
[4520.34 --> 4520.60]  Okay.
[4521.46 --> 4527.62]  And then at 3822, I, having played DDR only
[4527.62 --> 4529.98]  like two or three times before in my
[4529.98 --> 4533.20]  life, played DDR versus Kenton.
[4533.20 --> 4537.62]  I did not do well.
[4537.76 --> 4539.28]  Look at you not even pressing the, oh,
[4539.38 --> 4539.64]  perfect.
[4539.76 --> 4540.04]  Great.
[4540.24 --> 4540.50]  Perfect.
[4540.94 --> 4541.20]  Perfect.
[4541.70 --> 4542.02]  Great.
[4542.16 --> 4542.30]  Yeah.
[4542.30 --> 4544.76]  But look at how basic mine is compared
[4544.76 --> 4545.26]  to his.
[4545.78 --> 4548.76]  I'm playing on like super easy new mode.
[4549.18 --> 4549.42]  Yeah.
[4549.80 --> 4550.96]  You don't have a bar.
[4551.32 --> 4553.62]  The bar does make it like wildly easier.
[4554.30 --> 4556.26]  He apparently doesn't like the bar.
[4557.20 --> 4557.68]  Interesting.
[4558.08 --> 4559.24]  Not a bar guy.
[4559.74 --> 4559.94]  Hmm.
[4560.96 --> 4561.28]  Yeah.
[4561.28 --> 4561.40]  Yeah.
[4562.44 --> 4564.18]  So we're going to be doing a video
[4564.18 --> 4566.66]  showcasing the full house and Andy, our
[4566.66 --> 4568.22]  camera operator, filmed this behind the
[4568.22 --> 4569.54]  scenes and mini vlog about our trip to
[4569.54 --> 4569.94]  the house.
[4570.42 --> 4572.12]  It's not coming out till early April.
[4572.12 --> 4573.66]  So if you want a sneak preview of what's
[4573.66 --> 4575.70]  to come, you can check it out at lmg.gg
[4575.70 --> 4576.90]  slash floatplane.
[4577.16 --> 4579.74]  Or if you're feeling lazy, you can just
[4579.74 --> 4582.98]  subscribe to our YouTube channel as a
[4582.98 --> 4583.84]  channel member.
[4584.48 --> 4587.16]  Huge shout out to Kenton and Jade, who
[4587.16 --> 4589.98]  graciously let us film there, both doing
[4589.98 --> 4592.20]  the tour of their house as well as shooting
[4592.20 --> 4594.42]  our 9070 review video.
[4595.52 --> 4595.76]  Yeah.
[4596.22 --> 4597.90]  I got one more merch message here before
[4597.90 --> 4598.80]  we move on.
[4599.14 --> 4600.86]  Good evening, Sebi, Laffy and Bessie.
[4601.36 --> 4603.66]  I have yet to lose a video game to my 14
[4603.66 --> 4605.60]  year old son, but that day is coming.
[4606.26 --> 4608.94]  Linus, what games can you confidently say
[4608.94 --> 4610.66]  you'll never lose to yours?
[4610.66 --> 4614.78]  Ooh, I don't know.
[4614.88 --> 4615.84]  He's pretty good.
[4616.92 --> 4617.48]  Yeah.
[4617.92 --> 4626.34]  Like he like he can beat me in like
[4626.34 --> 4627.28]  ultimate chicken horse.
[4627.28 --> 4628.18]  Like it's close.
[4628.34 --> 4631.52]  So for like 2d platforming, it's it's
[4631.52 --> 4633.02]  really, really close.
[4633.20 --> 4636.18]  Is there a game that you actively play as
[4636.18 --> 4636.96]  much as he does?
[4638.98 --> 4641.22]  Uh, because like there's going to be
[4641.22 --> 4643.12]  games he can beat you in for sure, but
[4643.12 --> 4643.46]  he plays.
[4643.56 --> 4645.08]  I mean, he's old enough now that he has
[4645.08 --> 4646.28]  his own preferences, right?
[4646.34 --> 4648.30]  Like he doesn't, he doesn't just play
[4648.30 --> 4649.26]  whatever dad plays.
[4649.52 --> 4651.42]  So like I'm better than him at tape to
[4651.42 --> 4654.62]  tape, but he picked it up really fast.
[4655.24 --> 4657.38]  Especially he was not naming any names
[4657.38 --> 4660.22]  last time compared to some of the other
[4660.22 --> 4662.82]  people that we've brought into the crew.
[4662.82 --> 4664.26]  Low bar.
[4664.90 --> 4667.86]  Um, yeah, I, something that I've noticed
[4667.86 --> 4670.72]  with him though, is that like, I swear
[4670.72 --> 4673.52]  it's within like the last year or two at
[4673.52 --> 4674.02]  most.
[4674.18 --> 4674.44]  Yeah.
[4674.50 --> 4677.16]  There's been a huge spike in like his
[4677.16 --> 4679.30]  ability to perform in games.
[4679.98 --> 4682.04]  Um, yeah, no, he's like, he's like good.
[4682.10 --> 4684.86]  Like if we, uh, like I, I was standing
[4684.86 --> 4689.32]  over him and he like won Fortnite and I
[4689.32 --> 4692.96]  was like, do you do this regularly?
[4693.76 --> 4696.76]  Um, and he was like, oh, I don't know,
[4696.82 --> 4699.06]  like once out of every, some amount less
[4699.06 --> 4699.56]  than 10.
[4699.64 --> 4700.74]  And I was like, oh, okay.
[4701.42 --> 4704.62]  So he's like, yeah.
[4704.64 --> 4706.96]  And he was just like mowing down human
[4706.96 --> 4707.48]  players.
[4707.66 --> 4709.98]  And like, you can, you can tell from the
[4709.98 --> 4711.28]  usernames, I think it was, I looked it
[4711.28 --> 4712.84]  up at the time, but they were like
[4712.84 --> 4714.42]  definitely human players.
[4714.56 --> 4717.50]  And I'm like, okay, well, I guess that's
[4717.50 --> 4717.78]  something.
[4717.78 --> 4718.90]  Look at this, right?
[4721.44 --> 4723.52]  Little man's not super little anymore.
[4724.36 --> 4725.42]  Oh, heck no.
[4728.60 --> 4729.04]  Yeah.
[4729.28 --> 4729.56]  Nope.
[4729.56 --> 4731.94]  That nickname has become less and less
[4731.94 --> 4733.18]  appropriate over the years.
[4733.28 --> 4733.50]  Yeah.
[4733.90 --> 4736.72]  Um, I don't know how long we're gonna,
[4736.72 --> 4739.78]  we're gonna keep it up anyway, but, um,
[4740.74 --> 4744.24]  yeah, no, he's, uh, he's very much just
[4744.24 --> 4747.36]  like a slightly, uh, like the, the
[4747.36 --> 4747.74]  nickname.
[4747.98 --> 4750.28]  Oh, because it sort of seems like it's
[4750.28 --> 4753.22]  getting unnecessary, but, um, to him, I
[4753.22 --> 4753.54]  assume.
[4754.90 --> 4755.22]  Yeah.
[4755.42 --> 4755.78]  Yeah.
[4755.78 --> 4757.10]  I mean, yeah, that should be, that
[4757.10 --> 4758.08]  should be a decision he makes.
[4758.12 --> 4759.34]  He's getting old enough that he can
[4759.34 --> 4761.20]  kind of make decisions for himself.
[4762.10 --> 4763.94]  Um, yeah, I'm still trying to think
[4763.94 --> 4764.52]  like FPS.
[4764.88 --> 4766.28]  He's probably on my level.
[4766.28 --> 4768.90]  So it would come down to, you know,
[4768.90 --> 4769.92]  what game we're playing.
[4770.24 --> 4771.62]  Like if we played something that he
[4771.62 --> 4773.00]  has a ton of hours in, he would have a
[4773.00 --> 4773.58]  huge advantage.
[4773.58 --> 4774.76]  If we played something that I have a
[4774.76 --> 4776.00]  ton of hours in, I would have a huge
[4776.00 --> 4776.44]  advantage.
[4776.84 --> 4778.90]  Like in a lot of ways, knowing the map,
[4778.98 --> 4780.66]  knowing the weapons, knowing the meta
[4780.66 --> 4782.40]  is way more important than just like
[4782.40 --> 4784.10]  raw FPS skills, unless you're playing
[4784.10 --> 4786.30]  like Quake Arena or something.
[4786.30 --> 4786.54]  Right.
[4787.64 --> 4792.84]  Um, I'd beat him at an RTS like very
[4792.84 --> 4796.40]  easily just because he hasn't really
[4796.40 --> 4796.74]  played.
[4797.08 --> 4797.52]  Yeah.
[4797.58 --> 4799.02]  But I think if we picked up a brand new
[4799.02 --> 4801.62]  game, uh, he would probably be like on
[4801.62 --> 4802.24]  par immediately.
[4802.42 --> 4804.32]  And then he'd probably beat me in a very
[4804.32 --> 4805.20]  short amount of time.
[4806.16 --> 4810.52]  I mean, just like basic biology stuff,
[4810.52 --> 4812.16]  like reflex level, he's just going to
[4812.16 --> 4812.60]  kill you.
[4813.90 --> 4814.34]  Yep.
[4814.62 --> 4815.36]  Every day.
[4815.36 --> 4816.60]  I always joke about this.
[4816.88 --> 4819.00]  I'm just like every day, you know, I get
[4819.00 --> 4820.94]  older, dumber and slower and weaker.
[4821.30 --> 4824.04]  And every day you get well older, but
[4824.04 --> 4826.76]  also like smarter, faster and stronger.
[4827.02 --> 4827.36]  So yeah.
[4828.18 --> 4828.66]  Yeah.
[4829.44 --> 4829.78]  Yeah.
[4829.78 --> 4831.72]  That's just, that's just the way it is.
[4831.80 --> 4832.92]  That's the way it is.
[4833.10 --> 4835.40]  And I think, I think my like, Oh, the
[4835.40 --> 4837.74]  last one or two years thing, I think it's
[4837.74 --> 4839.92]  just those curves have started getting a
[4839.92 --> 4840.58]  lot closer.
[4840.78 --> 4844.72]  Like two years ago, if we played a game,
[4844.72 --> 4847.70]  like, it's like, okay, time to carry a
[4847.70 --> 4850.46]  little man, which was more than fine, you
[4850.46 --> 4852.14]  know, like no problem whatsoever.
[4852.14 --> 4854.78]  But it was like, the goal is carrying
[4854.78 --> 4855.34]  little man.
[4855.40 --> 4857.56]  And now it's like, the goal is trying to
[4857.56 --> 4861.46]  not lose as much as possible to little
[4861.46 --> 4861.76]  man.
[4861.76 --> 4865.16]  Like it's, it's, it's the mission has
[4865.16 --> 4865.56]  shifted.
[4866.74 --> 4867.14]  Yeah.
[4867.54 --> 4869.16]  No, he beat me for the first time.
[4869.22 --> 4870.62]  I think the first game he ever beat me
[4870.62 --> 4871.46]  at was Towerfall.
[4871.72 --> 4873.22]  And it was like years ago.
[4873.44 --> 4874.68]  Like he's, he's pretty good.
[4874.82 --> 4877.94]  And Towerfall like has pretty robust
[4877.94 --> 4878.76]  rubber banding.
[4878.92 --> 4880.88]  Like it's, it's inherent to the game.
[4880.96 --> 4883.30]  And he got a little lucky that first time.
[4883.80 --> 4886.12]  But still, I was like, damn.
[4886.12 --> 4888.48]  Yeah, for sure.
[4888.64 --> 4890.08]  Because I had gotten from being able to
[4890.08 --> 4891.78]  win a round anytime I wanted to
[4891.78 --> 4893.46]  legitimately losing sometimes.
[4894.82 --> 4895.56]  Oh, yeah.
[4895.56 --> 4898.64]  Like I, I mean, I haven't, I pointed this
[4898.64 --> 4900.42]  out probably too many times, but I was
[4900.42 --> 4901.40]  frustrated about it.
[4901.66 --> 4903.24]  I haven't played Mario Kart in forever.
[4904.08 --> 4906.14]  He had, you know, the more advantageous
[4906.14 --> 4907.28]  sight line, all these other kinds of
[4907.28 --> 4909.24]  things, but there is something that is
[4909.24 --> 4911.22]  fairly undeniable in Mario Kart, which
[4911.22 --> 4914.40]  is when you consistently get first, it's
[4914.40 --> 4916.90]  like, oh, because when you're playing
[4916.90 --> 4919.94]  against bots, you'll often get like item
[4919.94 --> 4920.28]  dumped.
[4921.24 --> 4921.68]  Yeah.
[4921.70 --> 4923.32]  So like if you get first in literally
[4923.32 --> 4926.74]  every single map on a circuit, it's
[4926.74 --> 4929.24]  like, oh, yeah, you're like, you're, you
[4929.24 --> 4929.80]  know what you're doing.
[4929.88 --> 4930.62]  You're pretty good.
[4930.86 --> 4932.76]  And he, I think he did that to us at
[4932.76 --> 4934.96]  least once, if not every time.
[4935.38 --> 4937.46]  He got it a few times in one Grand Prix.
[4937.54 --> 4937.86]  Yeah.
[4938.00 --> 4939.56]  Which is like, okay.
[4939.82 --> 4940.16]  Yeah.
[4941.36 --> 4944.38]  Now our advancing age did make that
[4944.38 --> 4945.64]  split screen on the switch.
[4945.64 --> 4946.28]  That was tough.
[4947.00 --> 4948.80]  We, I don't know how much realistic
[4948.80 --> 4950.16]  competition we were going to be.
[4950.26 --> 4951.60]  Cause we, so we were trying to play on
[4951.60 --> 4952.90]  a switch in an airplane.
[4953.16 --> 4955.48]  So like, I mean, neither of our eyes
[4955.48 --> 4957.62]  are amazing and we're like leaning over
[4957.62 --> 4958.68]  trying to see it properly and stuff.
[4958.90 --> 4960.92]  But the, the reason why I mentioned the
[4960.92 --> 4963.04]  AIs is because he did that against 150
[4963.04 --> 4965.34]  CC AIs and people are going to say
[4965.34 --> 4966.46]  like, oh, it's not that hard.
[4966.76 --> 4968.32]  The, the hard part that I'm pointing
[4968.32 --> 4969.40]  out is the consistency.
[4970.68 --> 4971.08]  Yep.
[4971.66 --> 4976.28]  Um, and also it's, it's a gap.
[4976.36 --> 4978.14]  It's a change compared to one or two
[4978.14 --> 4978.68]  years ago.
[4979.48 --> 4981.70]  And neither Luke nor I are like
[4981.70 --> 4985.08]  completely unversed in the Mario cart.
[4985.24 --> 4985.60]  Yes.
[4985.92 --> 4986.14]  Yeah.
[4986.14 --> 4987.44]  So it's not like we were, even
[4987.44 --> 4988.68]  though it was hard to see and there
[4988.68 --> 4990.28]  was a bit of joystick drift to contend
[4990.28 --> 4991.68]  with, it's not like we weren't there.
[4991.74 --> 4992.10]  No.
[4992.22 --> 4993.08]  You know, causing trouble.
[4993.08 --> 4994.70]  Like the problem that I had was I, I
[4994.70 --> 4996.38]  literally could not see bananas.
[4997.12 --> 4999.24]  So like, I remember I w I was in first
[4999.24 --> 5001.30]  and in one lap I hit five.
[5001.54 --> 5003.82]  It was just like, I guess I lose now.
[5003.88 --> 5005.96]  Like there's just, there was no, there
[5005.96 --> 5008.02]  was no way to recover because I hit five
[5008.02 --> 5008.92]  bananas in one lap.
[5009.04 --> 5010.24]  I could not dodge them.
[5010.72 --> 5013.00]  Um, so that was a little bit unique,
[5013.04 --> 5015.62]  but it, it, what I'm kind of pointing
[5015.62 --> 5017.20]  out is that our performance, as much as
[5017.20 --> 5019.86]  we sucked, um, isn't even super relevant
[5019.86 --> 5021.74]  to the observation that he was really
[5021.74 --> 5022.08]  good.
[5022.68 --> 5024.76]  Um, so I don't know.
[5024.84 --> 5025.06]  Yeah.
[5025.14 --> 5025.72]  It's interesting.
[5028.20 --> 5030.06]  Should we move into another topic
[5030.06 --> 5030.30]  here?
[5030.60 --> 5032.00]  No, let's do some sponsors.
[5032.12 --> 5032.68]  I'm sorry.
[5033.48 --> 5034.18]  Oh, what?
[5034.70 --> 5035.94]  Uh, we should do one more topic.
[5036.16 --> 5036.48]  Yeah.
[5036.74 --> 5037.16]  Oh, okay.
[5037.80 --> 5038.24]  Overruled.
[5038.24 --> 5040.52]  Pokemon Go sold to Saudi Arabia
[5040.52 --> 5041.96]  in public investment fund.
[5043.38 --> 5043.78]  Fine.
[5044.62 --> 5045.96]  Wait, we can do something else if you
[5045.96 --> 5046.18]  want.
[5047.12 --> 5048.90]  I was going to do MSI announces
[5048.90 --> 5050.00]  their 19th.
[5050.00 --> 5051.22]  That's our other major topic.
[5051.22 --> 5051.80]  Let's do it.
[5052.12 --> 5052.50]  Fine.
[5053.40 --> 5053.70]  Yeah.
[5053.84 --> 5054.06]  Okay.
[5054.22 --> 5054.48]  Yeah.
[5055.60 --> 5056.00]  Okay.
[5056.22 --> 5059.34]  MSI announced the shadow two X and
[5059.34 --> 5063.18]  shadow two X OC, a dual fan design
[5063.18 --> 5065.08]  for the RTX 5070.
[5065.38 --> 5067.82]  It appears to be the smallest 5070
[5067.82 --> 5069.30]  from any manufacturer, at least
[5069.30 --> 5072.56]  according to PC part picker, um,
[5072.72 --> 5076.06]  being only 231 millimeters in length.
[5076.06 --> 5080.62]  But here's my issue with this.
[5080.62 --> 5084.02]  And I've seen this a lot of times is
[5084.02 --> 5087.96]  why does MSI need 19?
[5088.12 --> 5089.08]  I kid you not.
[5089.58 --> 5093.94]  19 versions of the RTX 5070 when they
[5093.94 --> 5096.50]  don't appear to be able to consistently
[5096.50 --> 5100.38]  ship any of them at MSRP.
[5100.38 --> 5104.36]  Hey, what is actually going on here?
[5104.44 --> 5107.38]  I, I legitimately would like the answer
[5107.38 --> 5110.18]  because I legitimately don't know.
[5110.34 --> 5113.60]  What is the point of creating more and
[5113.60 --> 5117.46]  more and more versions of, of this GPU
[5117.46 --> 5121.62]  when you can't fulfill orders for your
[5121.62 --> 5125.00]  earlier GPUs that you already released?
[5125.90 --> 5127.70]  Some of them are so similar to you.
[5128.78 --> 5129.14]  Okay.
[5129.34 --> 5129.68]  Hold on.
[5129.74 --> 5130.32]  Hold on a second.
[5130.72 --> 5133.44]  So Ed Zelm says MSRP is too low.
[5133.76 --> 5134.02]  Yes.
[5134.16 --> 5135.40]  That is one of the reasons.
[5135.60 --> 5138.16]  So you stop shipping your MSRP card
[5138.16 --> 5139.26]  that you released and you go, Oh,
[5139.30 --> 5140.42]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[5140.88 --> 5142.44]  We have an MSRP card.
[5142.54 --> 5143.68]  We just don't have that one right now.
[5143.72 --> 5144.52]  We have the more expensive one,
[5144.60 --> 5148.46]  but in a lot of cases, that's not even
[5148.46 --> 5149.60]  the D the defense.
[5149.60 --> 5151.48]  Cause it's not just always a new higher
[5151.48 --> 5153.12]  price when it's just, it's just another,
[5153.20 --> 5153.86]  another one.
[5153.86 --> 5158.00]  And made in Canada says because money,
[5158.06 --> 5159.76]  but it's like, no, you're not making more
[5159.76 --> 5163.20]  money by developing yet another board and
[5163.20 --> 5164.10]  yet another cooler.
[5164.32 --> 5165.74]  If anything, you're just, you're just
[5165.74 --> 5166.88]  adding cost.
[5168.82 --> 5170.72]  Spider Murphy says shareholders like big
[5170.72 --> 5171.28]  numbers of products.
[5171.34 --> 5172.28]  That's not even true.
[5172.98 --> 5176.04]  Shareholders like a well understood
[5176.04 --> 5177.50]  product line that sells well.
[5178.34 --> 5181.68]  There is no way on this green earth that
[5181.68 --> 5184.52]  MSI releasing another version of 5070 could
[5184.52 --> 5188.06]  possibly impact their sales of RTX 5070.
[5189.32 --> 5192.88]  Their allocation of GPUs from Nvidia is
[5192.88 --> 5194.28]  fixed at this time.
[5195.08 --> 5197.78]  So yes, they could be more competitive,
[5198.14 --> 5200.78]  you know, in a particular, like, oh, it's a
[5200.78 --> 5201.76]  smaller one or whatever.
[5201.76 --> 5203.86]  Like this particular card could be more
[5203.86 --> 5205.12]  interesting or, or whatever.
[5205.50 --> 5207.90]  But at the end of the day, they will sell
[5207.90 --> 5213.48]  100% of the 5070 GPUs that Nvidia ships them.
[5214.06 --> 5216.74]  So what are we doing here?
[5217.04 --> 5218.28]  What is the point of this?
[5218.34 --> 5219.40]  Does anybody know?
[5219.40 --> 5221.36]  I want to know.
[5222.32 --> 5222.72]  Legitimately.
[5223.42 --> 5224.32]  I have no idea.
[5224.32 --> 5225.18]  Luke, do you know?
[5225.30 --> 5227.18]  I can't even guess to be honest.
[5227.24 --> 5228.40]  It seems very weird to me.
[5230.08 --> 5232.86]  But it's something that I've seen time and
[5232.86 --> 5233.84]  time again.
[5234.06 --> 5235.50]  You'll have this product that's under
[5235.50 --> 5237.52]  allocation and you'll have these brands
[5237.52 --> 5240.52]  releasing more and more versions of it.
[5241.44 --> 5242.58]  For what purpose?
[5242.74 --> 5242.90]  Yeah.
[5243.04 --> 5243.44]  Mr.
[5243.52 --> 5245.86]  Wizard 2K said market capture.
[5245.86 --> 5248.60]  Like, is it just your, your like news
[5248.60 --> 5249.80]  stuffing kind of?
[5250.78 --> 5252.40]  Maybe, but for, to what end?
[5252.94 --> 5253.20]  I don't know.
[5253.20 --> 5253.86]  Just getting your name up there.
[5253.86 --> 5255.96]  Give me the news that, give me the news
[5255.96 --> 5257.18]  that you have it in stock.
[5257.92 --> 5259.00]  Yeah, I hear that.
[5259.04 --> 5261.18]  But like, you know, Google news feed.
[5261.82 --> 5263.94]  If it, if I, if I scroll to my feed and
[5263.94 --> 5266.50]  I see, oh, MSI released a new 5070 or
[5266.50 --> 5268.40]  something like, yeah, they're just.
[5268.40 --> 5269.94]  I mean, I guess it's making us talk about
[5269.94 --> 5270.08]  it.
[5270.20 --> 5271.06]  Is there any, yeah.
[5271.18 --> 5273.64]  Is there any stock of any of this stuff?
[5273.64 --> 5274.48]  Like, um.
[5274.48 --> 5278.30]  Jake message saying that in Canada,
[5278.30 --> 5280.66]  there's some 50 series cards that are in
[5280.66 --> 5282.66]  stock at Memex, but apparently in America,
[5282.66 --> 5284.20]  it's still really tough right now.
[5286.20 --> 5288.04]  Mighty Mike asks, do they get extra
[5288.04 --> 5289.38]  allocation for each product line?
[5289.56 --> 5293.62]  Not that I'm aware of, but, but Bent Bob
[5293.62 --> 5294.52]  has a good theory.
[5295.12 --> 5298.94]  More SKUs means more listings in store
[5298.94 --> 5301.24]  pages, even if they're out of stock and
[5301.24 --> 5302.78]  therefore more brand awareness.
[5302.78 --> 5304.84]  But this is, yeah, that's kind of.
[5305.26 --> 5306.00]  That's an idea.
[5307.12 --> 5307.36]  Yeah.
[5310.10 --> 5311.74]  Um, what else are we looking for?
[5311.82 --> 5311.96]  Yeah.
[5312.00 --> 5312.90]  More search results.
[5313.94 --> 5314.92]  Maybe it's that.
[5315.54 --> 5318.88]  Man, GPU prices are so broken.
[5320.88 --> 5322.08]  I don't even know.
[5322.74 --> 5325.84]  Like, I just, I went on Amazon and I
[5325.84 --> 5328.24]  looked for MSI NVIDIA 5070.
[5328.24 --> 5331.90]  Like, what am I even looking at?
[5335.90 --> 5338.72]  Raiden428 says, Zotac are being legends.
[5339.04 --> 5341.06]  Their Discord is a great place to get cards.
[5341.82 --> 5344.02]  Um, that's pretty cool to see them
[5344.02 --> 5346.20]  engaging directly with the gaming community.
[5346.94 --> 5347.30]  Sweet.
[5347.46 --> 5348.00]  Like that.
[5348.00 --> 5352.62]  Um, all right.
[5353.34 --> 5355.88]  The same day that MSI released this card,
[5356.12 --> 5358.96]  NVIDIA claimed it has shipped twice as many
[5358.96 --> 5363.16]  RTX 50 series GPUs compared to the RTX 40 series
[5363.16 --> 5364.54]  five weeks after launch.
[5364.54 --> 5368.56]  However, it is worth noting that the RTX 4090
[5368.56 --> 5371.40]  was the only RTX 40 series card for the first
[5371.40 --> 5372.58]  five weeks after its launch.
[5372.98 --> 5374.80]  And it also suffered from stock issues.
[5375.34 --> 5375.98]  So that's something.
[5376.66 --> 5379.20]  Um, so they actually have like four times as many
[5379.20 --> 5381.56]  SKUs, many of which are at much lower prices
[5381.56 --> 5384.38]  and have only shipped twice as many GPUs.
[5384.38 --> 5387.98]  Meanwhile, AMD Vice President David McAfee said
[5387.98 --> 5391.20]  in a podcast that demand for the RX 9070 and
[5391.20 --> 5395.60]  9070 XT has been, quote, unprecedented and that
[5395.60 --> 5398.10]  the company's number one priority is restocking
[5398.10 --> 5401.10]  GPUs, particularly at MSRP.
[5404.62 --> 5407.18]  Do you remember the MSRP for the 9070?
[5409.82 --> 5410.72]  Or XT?
[5411.04 --> 5411.92]  In CAD?
[5411.92 --> 5414.12]  Oh, in CAD, I have no idea.
[5414.24 --> 5416.80]  But 549 USD and 599 USD.
[5417.08 --> 5419.26]  So that times 1.45 or so.
[5420.54 --> 5424.06]  Um, 549 USD to CAD.
[5425.04 --> 5426.40]  So 790.
[5426.94 --> 5428.86]  And this is Amazon right now.
[5429.98 --> 5431.30]  Like, man.
[5432.26 --> 5432.92]  Come on.
[5435.68 --> 5438.58]  $1,200 cards that are supposed to be 790.
[5438.74 --> 5439.82]  Like, please.
[5439.82 --> 5444.30]  I wish I had the power to say, hey guys, just don't buy it
[5444.30 --> 5447.34]  if it's not at or at least near MSRP.
[5447.66 --> 5452.50]  And this is the thing that I feel like I talk about a lot
[5452.50 --> 5456.18]  and people kind of get frustrated at me for talking about it.
[5456.54 --> 5459.46]  But the reason I talk about it is because there seems to be
[5459.46 --> 5464.30]  a significant number of people that feel like it's the
[5464.30 --> 5467.54]  reviewers fault for not going hard enough at these companies
[5467.54 --> 5469.36]  for the pricing.
[5469.36 --> 5469.54]  There's nothing to do with it.
[5470.18 --> 5472.44]  There's nothing that I can do about it.
[5472.56 --> 5475.04]  If you keep buying so many of them that they're sold out constantly,
[5475.18 --> 5477.42]  all you're doing is teaching these companies that honestly
[5477.42 --> 5478.40]  they're underpriced.
[5479.24 --> 5479.56]  Like...
[5479.56 --> 5479.88]  Yes.
[5479.88 --> 5481.20]  That's it.
[5483.90 --> 5484.34]  Yes.
[5484.84 --> 5485.58]  A hundred percent.
[5485.60 --> 5486.06]  Supply and demand.
[5486.32 --> 5486.84]  And...
[5486.84 --> 5489.20]  There clearly isn't enough supply so price can go up.
[5489.84 --> 5493.76]  Like we talked about recently where we compared the total addressable market
[5493.76 --> 5497.36]  for GPUs and gaming, PC gaming,
[5497.36 --> 5500.88]  with the kind of viewership that, you know,
[5500.94 --> 5502.52]  tech review channels get.
[5503.92 --> 5508.90]  I reach this like tiny fraction of gamers.
[5509.42 --> 5510.78]  Like at the end of the day,
[5510.92 --> 5514.86]  I don't even see the point from NVIDIA and AMD's perspective.
[5515.10 --> 5518.90]  I don't even see the point in engaging with reviewers anymore.
[5519.60 --> 5520.04]  Why?
[5521.18 --> 5522.54]  I still think it matters.
[5522.70 --> 5524.44]  I know your doomer view on this,
[5524.54 --> 5526.60]  but I still think it matters to be completely honest.
[5526.60 --> 5527.60]  I think there's a...
[5527.60 --> 5528.14]  Well, it matters.
[5528.52 --> 5529.90]  We're still going to cover it.
[5530.02 --> 5532.70]  I think there's an opinion zeitgeist that can kind of happen
[5532.70 --> 5536.60]  where like if enough enthusiasts condemn a product...
[5537.92 --> 5540.32]  And the price, in my opinion,
[5540.48 --> 5542.62]  almost never results in anything,
[5542.86 --> 5545.98]  especially for products like this that are just constantly sold out.
[5546.08 --> 5547.82]  It's going to become irrelevant to people.
[5547.96 --> 5549.50]  But if people are like,
[5549.54 --> 5550.90]  this thing just sucks,
[5551.24 --> 5551.78]  it's buggy,
[5551.82 --> 5552.30]  it doesn't work,
[5552.36 --> 5552.60]  whatever,
[5553.00 --> 5554.38]  it won't sell.
[5554.38 --> 5558.06]  Like that word will get out to the people that don't watch your channel.
[5559.10 --> 5560.42]  But I mean,
[5560.42 --> 5565.00]  we're talking about very mature companies with very mature product lines.
[5565.76 --> 5566.28]  Yeah.
[5567.06 --> 5568.16]  But like...
[5568.16 --> 5568.56]  Okay, no.
[5568.82 --> 5568.98]  No.
[5569.24 --> 5569.44]  Here.
[5569.98 --> 5572.60]  Find me a 50-90 founders in stock then.
[5573.06 --> 5575.92]  Because that thing literally can light on fire.
[5577.66 --> 5579.24]  And everyone's talking about it.
[5579.24 --> 5581.16]  How many of them though?
[5582.90 --> 5583.78]  I'm just saying,
[5583.90 --> 5587.18]  what we say is not going to impact how many they can sell.
[5588.32 --> 5589.36]  So why do they care?
[5593.30 --> 5595.06]  Why bother to engage with us at all?
[5595.12 --> 5596.12]  Because theoretically, right?
[5596.14 --> 5599.36]  Yeah, but I didn't say that what you say matters all the time.
[5599.94 --> 5603.86]  I said that if you say that something is really bad,
[5603.92 --> 5605.02]  you're not saying it's really bad.
[5605.02 --> 5607.48]  You're saying it's very performant,
[5607.58 --> 5608.66]  but might light on fire.
[5609.98 --> 5611.60]  And then they can decide that for themselves.
[5612.06 --> 5612.68]  But you can say,
[5612.76 --> 5614.68]  don't pre-order things and nobody's going to listen
[5614.68 --> 5617.42]  and they're going to pre-order in crazier amounts than you've ever heard of.
[5617.46 --> 5617.96]  And you're going to say,
[5617.96 --> 5619.02]  don't do microtransactions.
[5619.68 --> 5623.70]  And people are going to buy microtransactions of like 80% plus of people.
[5623.70 --> 5631.32]  But if something is actually just a piece of junk and undesirable because of that,
[5631.40 --> 5632.60]  people will not buy it.
[5633.72 --> 5636.08]  There are certain things that people won't listen to.
[5636.18 --> 5638.92]  They'll let their greed override certain desires.
[5639.04 --> 5642.56]  So like if it's really expensive, but it's like cool,
[5642.78 --> 5644.04]  they're just going to buy it anyways.
[5644.46 --> 5648.06]  If they just want it really bad, they'll pre-order it.
[5648.10 --> 5648.64]  They'll do whatever.
[5648.78 --> 5650.80]  Like those things, those aren't going to stop people.
[5650.80 --> 5651.80]  Oh, I shouldn't buy microtransactions,
[5651.80 --> 5655.74]  microtransactions, but this guy just killed me in this game.
[5655.78 --> 5657.60]  And I would prefer to be able to kill him.
[5657.70 --> 5660.24]  So I'm going to buy this microtransaction to become stronger
[5660.24 --> 5661.24]  and then beat him anyways.
[5662.52 --> 5665.92]  That type of thing is very easy to prey on with people.
[5667.26 --> 5669.44]  But if you're like, this thing is actually just junk,
[5670.14 --> 5671.68]  then I think people won't buy it.
[5671.72 --> 5673.54]  But if you're like, this is great,
[5673.64 --> 5677.66]  but so overpriced that at this price, it is basically junk.
[5677.82 --> 5679.70]  I think people will still buy it.
[5680.56 --> 5681.70]  Because what they heard is,
[5681.80 --> 5682.38]  it's great.
[5683.54 --> 5686.54]  But that's the thing is like anything is anything,
[5686.96 --> 5690.70]  almost anything, like the humane pin is junk at any price.
[5690.92 --> 5694.48]  But almost anything is not junk when it's at the right price,
[5694.54 --> 5697.54]  especially when you've got like mature companies
[5697.54 --> 5699.80]  with pretty mature testing processes,
[5700.20 --> 5703.46]  mostly churning out products that are not complete junk.
[5703.84 --> 5705.40]  And so with that in mind,
[5705.56 --> 5708.06]  I think there's very few opportunities for us
[5708.06 --> 5712.12]  to really like stop consumers from getting scammed.
[5712.50 --> 5714.28]  All we can really do is say,
[5714.54 --> 5716.08]  hey, here's what's a good value.
[5716.48 --> 5718.00]  Here's what's not a good value.
[5718.54 --> 5720.78]  And it just feels like they're not,
[5721.30 --> 5722.84]  we don't have enough of reach.
[5722.84 --> 5724.58]  I think junk is too inflammatory.
[5724.58 --> 5725.12]  For it to really matter anyway.
[5725.32 --> 5727.50]  But like, look at the market share that Intel had,
[5727.84 --> 5729.34]  that they have lost, right?
[5729.40 --> 5732.28]  Like that didn't just happen from random people
[5732.28 --> 5734.18]  that have never looked at any tech reviewers,
[5734.18 --> 5736.62]  just randomly deciding to buy AMD
[5736.62 --> 5737.94]  for the first time in a decade.
[5738.44 --> 5740.36]  Like, no, that information came out.
[5740.70 --> 5742.48]  That information came from somewhere.
[5742.68 --> 5745.60]  It got into people's minds and it spread.
[5745.60 --> 5747.68]  You have people testing things.
[5748.08 --> 5753.30]  Those people are informing people on build a PC
[5753.30 --> 5755.52]  or PC par picker or whatever.
[5756.02 --> 5758.40]  These other various sites that are recommending,
[5758.62 --> 5760.44]  recommendation engines of some sort,
[5760.90 --> 5764.04]  the build a PC section of the forum,
[5764.16 --> 5764.80]  whatever it is.
[5765.44 --> 5767.52]  And then that spreads out and spreads out and spreads out
[5767.52 --> 5769.02]  and then word of mouth and word of mouth and word of mouth.
[5769.10 --> 5770.72]  And now AMD CPUs are super cool.
[5771.54 --> 5774.38]  It takes time, but you can saturate this information.
[5774.52 --> 5775.36]  You can still get it out.
[5775.36 --> 5777.72]  There's no like, tech reviewers are not irrelevant.
[5778.30 --> 5780.22]  It's just saying that you don't hit
[5780.22 --> 5782.64]  even a majority of the market share
[5782.64 --> 5784.14]  doesn't mean that you're irrelevant.
[5785.18 --> 5786.64]  It just means that a lot of people
[5786.64 --> 5788.78]  aren't going to be very actively listening.
[5790.46 --> 5790.86]  Yeah.
[5792.28 --> 5794.18]  Yeah, I guess I just am.
[5796.44 --> 5797.10]  I don't know.
[5797.16 --> 5798.66]  I guess it's just surprising to me
[5798.66 --> 5800.86]  because I live in my bubble
[5800.86 --> 5804.20]  where anytime that I buy a tech product,
[5804.20 --> 5806.18]  I look at reviews for it.
[5806.74 --> 5808.10]  And, you know, from my point of view,
[5808.22 --> 5810.98]  there's a lot of products that have sold really well
[5810.98 --> 5814.98]  that anyone who read a review for it shouldn't buy.
[5815.12 --> 5817.80]  And yet they do, you know?
[5817.80 --> 5821.74]  And I'm sure that someone, you know,
[5821.74 --> 5824.58]  will see me with my, you know, power tool or whatever
[5824.58 --> 5828.12]  and go, oh my God, there was a model for 30% less
[5828.12 --> 5831.06]  that has, you know, double the battery life
[5831.06 --> 5834.44]  and that idiot and it's more compact and whatever.
[5834.44 --> 5835.86]  And I'm just kind of sitting here going,
[5836.00 --> 5839.14]  yeah, I screw a drywall anchor into my wall
[5839.14 --> 5839.90]  every once in a while.
[5839.96 --> 5840.86]  I just don't really care.
[5840.86 --> 5844.52]  And I'm sure they feel the exact same way.
[5844.70 --> 5845.60]  Yeah, I play Fortnite.
[5846.98 --> 5848.94]  It's like, you know what I mean?
[5848.96 --> 5849.70]  Like, I don't know.
[5849.86 --> 5850.78]  I'm not a pro gamer.
[5850.82 --> 5851.96]  I get 60 FPS.
[5852.96 --> 5853.32]  Who cares?
[5853.52 --> 5854.72]  Yeah, like a lot of people
[5854.72 --> 5855.90]  aren't necessarily going to care.
[5856.00 --> 5857.50]  But then at the same time,
[5857.50 --> 5859.52]  if they hear from their enthusiast friend
[5859.52 --> 5861.04]  who watched one of your videos
[5861.04 --> 5862.60]  or one of anyone else's videos
[5862.60 --> 5864.44]  or read some article or whatever else,
[5864.86 --> 5869.12]  that, hey, you should buy AMD next time
[5869.12 --> 5872.70]  or something else that will shift
[5872.70 --> 5874.80]  purchasing patterns over time.
[5875.88 --> 5877.34]  Such big purchases.
[5877.62 --> 5878.50]  I think that's the thing
[5878.50 --> 5879.74]  that kind of kills me about it.
[5879.82 --> 5882.66]  I mean, and I excessively research things
[5882.66 --> 5883.86]  before I buy them and so do you,
[5883.92 --> 5884.88]  but not everybody's like that.
[5884.94 --> 5885.42]  And that's okay.
[5885.42 --> 5888.82]  Like house, car, computer
[5888.82 --> 5890.98]  are probably the three most important things
[5890.98 --> 5893.12]  in my life and probably a lot of you guys.
[5893.26 --> 5894.58]  Yeah, and you see people make
[5894.58 --> 5896.90]  30-minute decisions or less on houses.
[5896.90 --> 5901.50]  Like this is, people buy sight unseen.
[5903.68 --> 5904.90]  People are crazy.
[5905.44 --> 5907.12]  I don't understand at all.
[5907.84 --> 5908.62]  I don't even sort of get it.
[5908.62 --> 5909.36]  The way people buy cars
[5909.36 --> 5911.74]  makes absolutely no sense to me.
[5911.96 --> 5915.98]  The fact that like high pressure sales,
[5915.98 --> 5918.00]  you know, exists in cars
[5918.00 --> 5920.82]  and that people will like make a snap decision.
[5921.40 --> 5922.84]  Like at my personal policy,
[5922.84 --> 5925.30]  if I'm buying something like a car,
[5925.30 --> 5926.82]  anything that requires financing
[5926.82 --> 5930.60]  is I have my conversation with them.
[5931.06 --> 5932.06]  I go home and sleep.
[5932.24 --> 5935.58]  Like there's absolutely no way on this earth
[5935.58 --> 5937.14]  that I purchase a car
[5937.14 --> 5938.54]  without going home and sleeping.
[5938.88 --> 5939.42]  Yeah, sweet.
[5941.34 --> 5943.76]  But people 100% do it.
[5946.28 --> 5947.60]  Binky Draws says,
[5947.78 --> 5950.14]  any house I can get in this economy is worth it.
[5950.22 --> 5951.52]  Yeah, so I get that.
[5951.52 --> 5952.48]  But like there was,
[5953.00 --> 5955.52]  I remember when I was looking for my apartment,
[5955.68 --> 5958.94]  I remember I went to a new construction
[5958.94 --> 5962.02]  where they had like a demo unit
[5962.02 --> 5963.02]  of an apartment built,
[5963.02 --> 5964.64]  but the tower wasn't up yet.
[5965.82 --> 5967.74]  And you could walk through it and stuff.
[5967.78 --> 5968.58]  And I remember talking
[5968.58 --> 5970.18]  to one of the salespeople that were there.
[5972.70 --> 5974.28]  And I mentioned that like,
[5974.32 --> 5975.16]  I was kind of surprised
[5975.16 --> 5976.56]  because the salespeople that were there
[5976.56 --> 5978.62]  were pretty chill.
[5978.62 --> 5982.04]  They weren't really doing sales as it were.
[5982.72 --> 5984.14]  They were just kind of like hanging out
[5984.14 --> 5985.50]  and giving people snacks and stuff.
[5985.54 --> 5985.92]  And they were like,
[5986.00 --> 5986.90]  oh yeah, I mean,
[5986.98 --> 5988.46]  this is our first showing,
[5988.64 --> 5990.36]  but pretty much the entire inventory
[5990.36 --> 5991.18]  of the building is sold.
[5992.48 --> 5993.16]  And I was like,
[5993.48 --> 5994.16]  what?
[5994.64 --> 5995.10]  They're like,
[5995.14 --> 5996.52]  yeah, we have like two units left.
[5996.58 --> 5997.80]  We're building like four towers.
[5998.22 --> 5999.10]  It's all gone.
[6000.58 --> 6001.22]  I was like,
[6001.28 --> 6002.38]  okay,
[6002.52 --> 6003.80]  like how did that even happen
[6003.80 --> 6005.02]  if this is your first showing?
[6005.08 --> 6005.40]  And they're like,
[6005.46 --> 6006.84]  oh, people saw some pictures online
[6006.84 --> 6007.76]  and just bought all of it.
[6008.62 --> 6009.78]  It was just renders.
[6012.66 --> 6013.06]  Like,
[6013.56 --> 6013.90]  okay.
[6014.84 --> 6015.24]  Um,
[6015.60 --> 6015.82]  well,
[6015.90 --> 6017.24]  if you're buying it as an investment
[6017.24 --> 6018.72]  and you're not even going to live in it,
[6018.80 --> 6019.80]  then you don't care anyway,
[6019.84 --> 6020.28]  I guess,
[6020.34 --> 6020.56]  right?
[6021.00 --> 6021.18]  Yeah.
[6021.18 --> 6022.24]  Because you're just going to
[6022.24 --> 6023.94]  stick your tenant in it.
[6024.10 --> 6025.42]  And if the,
[6025.46 --> 6025.68]  you know,
[6025.78 --> 6027.62]  fridge can only be opened
[6027.62 --> 6028.90]  70% of the way
[6028.90 --> 6030.24]  before it whacks into something
[6030.24 --> 6030.66]  or whatever,
[6030.84 --> 6031.22]  you know,
[6031.22 --> 6031.86]  the kind of issue
[6031.86 --> 6032.94]  that you would only notice
[6032.94 --> 6035.00]  it like walking through a place
[6035.00 --> 6036.46]  and touching everything,
[6036.62 --> 6037.34]  opening stuff up,
[6037.34 --> 6037.78]  whatever.
[6038.10 --> 6039.18]  It's not going to be your problem.
[6039.30 --> 6039.92]  So what do you care?
[6040.24 --> 6040.52]  Yeah.
[6040.74 --> 6041.30]  I guess.
[6043.30 --> 6043.70]  Yeah.
[6045.06 --> 6046.22]  Conrad said the,
[6046.22 --> 6046.60]  uh,
[6046.70 --> 6047.70]  the BC housing market
[6047.70 --> 6048.82]  is looking really good lately.
[6049.06 --> 6049.50]  Uh,
[6049.50 --> 6050.00]  it's due,
[6050.12 --> 6051.86]  it seems to be doing better things,
[6051.86 --> 6052.52]  but I mean,
[6052.54 --> 6053.60]  we'll see how
[6053.60 --> 6055.42]  by looking good.
[6055.46 --> 6056.72]  We mean going down.
[6056.72 --> 6057.04]  Yeah.
[6057.04 --> 6057.30]  Oh yeah.
[6057.30 --> 6058.52]  That's looking good up here
[6058.52 --> 6059.18]  to be very clear.
[6059.70 --> 6060.10]  Um,
[6060.28 --> 6060.48]  yeah,
[6060.52 --> 6061.84]  I'm still rooting for it,
[6061.88 --> 6062.08]  Luke,
[6062.16 --> 6062.82]  even though,
[6062.94 --> 6063.52]  Oh yeah.
[6064.34 --> 6066.62]  A significant amount of my net worth
[6066.62 --> 6068.20]  is tied up in BC real estate.
[6068.20 --> 6069.12]  I am still,
[6069.12 --> 6071.00]  I'm still rooting for it.
[6071.12 --> 6071.78]  You'll be fine.
[6072.34 --> 6072.70]  Uh,
[6072.70 --> 6075.26]  I've taken a bit of a bath,
[6075.36 --> 6075.54]  sir.
[6075.62 --> 6076.82]  I've taken a bit of a bath,
[6076.92 --> 6077.52]  but you know what?
[6077.54 --> 6078.18]  I feel clean.
[6078.94 --> 6080.14]  I feel cleansed.
[6080.14 --> 6082.34]  Uh,
[6082.40 --> 6082.84]  I just,
[6082.94 --> 6083.10]  yeah,
[6083.10 --> 6083.44]  I don't know.
[6083.52 --> 6084.36]  I wonder where this,
[6084.48 --> 6085.04]  oh man.
[6085.40 --> 6085.80]  Oh,
[6085.84 --> 6086.56]  do I even say this?
[6086.60 --> 6088.30]  I really don't want to get into this topic on when.
[6093.04 --> 6093.74]  Is he muted?
[6094.10 --> 6094.40]  No,
[6094.56 --> 6095.94]  I just stopped.
[6096.50 --> 6096.90]  Um,
[6097.70 --> 6097.86]  Oh,
[6097.86 --> 6099.20]  it looked like your mouth was still moving.
[6099.28 --> 6099.80]  That was weird.
[6100.10 --> 6100.46]  Oh,
[6100.50 --> 6101.08]  it's the delay.
[6101.84 --> 6102.28]  Uh,
[6102.32 --> 6102.48]  yeah,
[6102.52 --> 6102.96]  probably.
[6103.84 --> 6104.80]  Chat says do it.
[6105.14 --> 6105.56]  Say it,
[6105.62 --> 6106.10]  no balls.
[6106.72 --> 6106.92]  You know,
[6107.00 --> 6107.18]  we're,
[6107.22 --> 6109.08]  we're in an extremely active,
[6109.08 --> 6111.28]  extremely erratic trade war right now.
[6111.28 --> 6114.32]  So we'll see what happens to housing in all of Canada,
[6114.46 --> 6115.08]  to be honest.
[6115.40 --> 6116.10]  Who knows?
[6116.22 --> 6116.46]  Yeah.
[6116.66 --> 6116.94]  We've,
[6116.98 --> 6119.68]  we've never been in this situation.
[6120.66 --> 6121.14]  Yeah.
[6121.26 --> 6121.56]  Ever.
[6122.02 --> 6122.46]  But Hey,
[6122.56 --> 6122.88]  I mean,
[6122.88 --> 6124.22]  it was for a really good reason.
[6124.58 --> 6127.38]  Like I know there's a lot of fentanyl,
[6127.38 --> 6128.14]  um,
[6128.20 --> 6131.04]  going over the border from Canada and it's really,
[6131.04 --> 6132.56]  it was really wise.
[6133.30 --> 6137.16]  It was wise and measured to put these.
[6137.88 --> 6138.40]  Yeah.
[6138.40 --> 6139.60]  It was stable.
[6139.80 --> 6142.50]  You could even say a genius move to,
[6142.50 --> 6143.00]  uh,
[6143.00 --> 6144.50]  put these measures in place.
[6145.70 --> 6147.74]  Dead anti-social info playing chat said,
[6147.80 --> 6148.82]  say your bull chat,
[6148.96 --> 6151.04]  which is a fantastic deep cut.
[6151.62 --> 6152.10]  Um,
[6153.26 --> 6153.52]  yeah,
[6153.52 --> 6153.96]  I don't know.
[6154.14 --> 6154.60]  I don't know.
[6154.64 --> 6154.96]  Whatever.
[6158.82 --> 6159.30]  Um,
[6159.54 --> 6161.28]  yeah.
[6162.28 --> 6162.94]  Good luck,
[6163.02 --> 6163.40]  everybody.
[6165.00 --> 6166.28]  It all makes release.
[6166.28 --> 6167.68]  It all makes a ton of sense.
[6168.12 --> 6169.62]  Everything makes sense right now.
[6170.14 --> 6173.98]  And a good reason is driving actions.
[6174.38 --> 6174.90]  Yeah.
[6175.30 --> 6175.78]  Uh,
[6175.98 --> 6176.44]  anyways,
[6176.54 --> 6176.80]  uh,
[6176.80 --> 6177.86]  company towns or something.
[6177.94 --> 6178.24]  Uh,
[6178.24 --> 6179.26]  what topic are we on?
[6179.32 --> 6179.96]  What are we doing?

[6269.26 --> 6272.56]  Did you know that a piece of you might've been sold online?
[6273.14 --> 6274.40]  I'm talking about your data,
[6274.98 --> 6275.50]  your address,
[6275.64 --> 6276.14]  your phone number,
[6276.22 --> 6276.64]  your email,
[6276.96 --> 6278.92]  even details about your loved ones.
[6279.38 --> 6282.08]  Don't let data brokers cash in on your personal information.
[6282.64 --> 6283.38]  Our sponsor,
[6283.68 --> 6287.48]  delete me can actually remove your data from hundreds of data brokers.
[6288.08 --> 6292.00]  Their team of experts tracks down your information and gets it wiped from these sites.
[6292.52 --> 6296.70]  Dennis even tried it out himself and found out that his data was listed on seven sites,
[6296.70 --> 6298.98]  including a ton of sensitive details.
[6299.00 --> 6302.16]  But now delete me has removed it all.
[6302.56 --> 6303.84]  The removal process is simple.
[6304.00 --> 6306.40]  You just sign up and their experts do the work for you.
[6306.64 --> 6310.06]  You'll get a detailed report in seven days and it doesn't stop there.
[6310.46 --> 6314.24]  Delete me can keep scanning and deleting for you regularly all year long.

[6321.80 --> 6322.36]  Finally,
[6322.58 --> 6323.90]  the show is brought to you by Odoo.
[6324.34 --> 6326.02]  Starting a business sounds scary,
[6326.28 --> 6327.94]  but not with our sponsor Odoo.
[6327.94 --> 6329.28]  In just minutes,
[6329.28 --> 6331.06]  Dennis created his website,
[6331.06 --> 6332.98]  Lucky Try Testing,
[6332.98 --> 6337.36]  turning his dream side hustle into reality.
[6337.78 --> 6339.26]  What is Lucky Try Testing?
[6339.40 --> 6340.14]  Oh, LTT.
[6340.14 --> 6340.58]  Okay.
[6340.58 --> 6348.66]  Odoo is an all-in-one business solution with over 50 apps for invoicing, marketing, HR, and more.
[6349.02 --> 6350.52]  But how does Dennis get customers?
[6351.06 --> 6354.62]  He uses Odoo's marketing tools to easily create email campaigns,
[6355.14 --> 6356.14]  track real-time stats,
[6356.14 --> 6363.10]  and even send promotions straight to his customer's pockets with SMS marketing.
[6363.46 --> 6365.48]  The interface is user-friendly and clean,
[6365.68 --> 6368.06]  so much so that it might completely change how you work.
[6368.40 --> 6369.60]  And with Odoo's appointment app,
[6369.96 --> 6372.34]  Dennis even set up a cry room schedule,
[6373.32 --> 6377.64]  allowing customers to book their sessions directly on his site.
[6377.80 --> 6378.22]  I need it.
[6378.58 --> 6378.86]  Dennis.
[6379.22 --> 6382.14]  You only select the apps your business needs,
[6382.18 --> 6383.58]  and if you just need one app,
[6383.68 --> 6384.26]  it's free.
[6384.26 --> 6386.96]  Check out Odoo at odoo.com slash when,
[6387.18 --> 6389.80]  or click the link in the description for a free 15-day trial.
[6390.20 --> 6392.18]  No credit card required.
[6393.00 --> 6394.70]  Oh my god, cry room.
[6395.26 --> 6395.66]  Please.
[6395.90 --> 6396.36]  What was it?
[6396.50 --> 6398.02]  Amazon that was rumored to have those?
[6399.68 --> 6400.84]  I think so.
[6400.98 --> 6401.40]  Is that right?
[6401.50 --> 6402.50]  I think it was Amazon.
[6404.48 --> 6405.04]  Ugh.
[6405.60 --> 6406.58]  Yeah, I think so.
[6407.68 --> 6410.82]  Should we talk about Pokemon Go being sold to the Saudis?
[6412.70 --> 6413.14]  Ugh.
[6414.26 --> 6414.94]  Yeah.
[6417.18 --> 6419.16]  I know you're a big Pokemon Go fan,
[6419.30 --> 6421.76]  so how does this make you feel before we even get...
[6421.76 --> 6422.88]  Actually, no, let's do the...
[6422.88 --> 6423.72]  I'll do the read first,
[6423.80 --> 6425.20]  and then you can talk about how it makes you feel.
[6425.62 --> 6425.98]  Sure.
[6425.98 --> 6426.30]  Niantic.
[6426.44 --> 6426.62]  Okay.
[6426.84 --> 6429.74]  Developer of Pokemon Go and Pokemon Go clones,
[6430.34 --> 6432.22]  Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom.
[6433.84 --> 6437.18]  Seriously, this company has made one game over and over for like 15 years.
[6437.18 --> 6439.30]  That's where a lot of gaming companies work.
[6439.30 --> 6439.80]  Okay.
[6439.80 --> 6448.84]  It's been acquired by Scopely, a subsidiary of Savvy Games Group, a multinational game investment fund group backed by Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.
[6448.84 --> 6454.38]  Niantic's AI mapping business, Niantic Spatial is supposedly being spun off as a separate entity,
[6454.38 --> 6460.80]  but is also receiving a $50 million investment from Scopely as well,
[6460.80 --> 6468.88]  which brings questions about what player data, including geolocation and AR scans of locations where they play the game,
[6469.22 --> 6474.28]  will be shared and used for by these parent companies.
[6474.28 --> 6481.52]  A blog post on Pokemon Go's website states that the entire Pokemon Go team is staying together through this partnership,
[6482.04 --> 6487.28]  and that this partnership will help improve the game and ensure longer-term support.
[6488.08 --> 6488.98]  Never heard that before.
[6489.14 --> 6493.68]  We've never heard that everyone's staying together until there's layoffs in like six months to a year.
[6493.80 --> 6495.10]  We've never heard that.
[6495.22 --> 6497.90]  That didn't happen at Microsoft recently.
[6498.96 --> 6500.66]  No, definitely not.
[6500.88 --> 6501.44]  Definitely not.
[6501.52 --> 6501.94]  Definitely not.
[6502.02 --> 6502.38]  Definitely not.
[6502.46 --> 6503.20]  This is...
[6503.20 --> 6503.88]  It's interesting.
[6503.88 --> 6509.94]  I mean, Tencent's been buying at least part of like every game for quite a while now.
[6511.08 --> 6517.50]  I guess the Saudi Arabia public investment fund just went a little harder and just bought a whole game.
[6518.94 --> 6521.06]  Because Tencent seems to usually buy parts.
[6522.60 --> 6523.70]  Different strategy.
[6525.50 --> 6526.64]  This is rough.
[6527.26 --> 6528.34]  This is rough.
[6528.90 --> 6532.10]  I expect even worse microtransactions.
[6532.10 --> 6533.10]  Funny enough.
[6533.10 --> 6533.14]  Funny enough.
[6533.38 --> 6536.02]  See, I have some unpopular takes on Pokemon Go.
[6536.12 --> 6539.84]  Being a Pokemon Go enjoyer, I actually think it is a bad game.
[6540.22 --> 6543.42]  And the only reason why I like it is because it gets me out walking.
[6544.78 --> 6548.42]  I think things like remote raid passes are bad.
[6549.82 --> 6552.66]  Just in general.
[6552.66 --> 6555.40]  Yeah, we know how you feel about that.
[6555.82 --> 6565.74]  I don't mind using other people for it because there's a method where you can use an app to let people add you to their friends lists.
[6565.98 --> 6570.38]  And then you can invite them and then they can remote into the raid that you are standing at.
[6570.38 --> 6576.92]  So I'll go walk around and then call people in to like fight the raid with me so I can do more difficult things.
[6577.36 --> 6580.38]  But I don't think you as an individual should use remote raid passes.
[6580.60 --> 6583.14]  But that is not a popular opinion.
[6583.14 --> 6585.40]  Unless you have like a disability or whatever.
[6585.60 --> 6585.76]  Sure, yeah.
[6586.24 --> 6591.38]  There are situations where it makes sense, sure.
[6591.62 --> 6592.52]  But for most people, not.
[6592.52 --> 6595.82]  Quantum Rand says, read the Pokemon Go privacy policy.
[6596.12 --> 6597.78]  This isn't an issue for players at all.
[6597.78 --> 6599.40]  Yeah, it's already really bad.
[6600.48 --> 6603.82]  Here's the thing about privacy policies, though.
[6604.12 --> 6607.36]  Is that they are only as bad as they are until they're worse.
[6608.48 --> 6612.38]  Nothing actually prevents a company from just updating their privacy policy.
[6612.90 --> 6617.82]  And then you're going to get a notification that the privacy policy was updated.
[6618.28 --> 6619.52]  Most people aren't going to read it.
[6619.52 --> 6624.88]  Or, you know, coming back to my point about people not paying attention to reviews of GPUs.
[6624.88 --> 6631.04]  People won't pay attention to community backlash around a privacy policy update in general.
[6631.04 --> 6635.82]  And it will just stay what it is because people are going to desperately need their new Pokemon.
[6636.80 --> 6638.88]  And then it is what it is.
[6639.62 --> 6640.00]  You know, okay.
[6640.00 --> 6641.68]  I'm going to counter a little bit.
[6641.68 --> 6646.20]  You said the, like, okay, remote raid passes are, it's good for people with disabilities.
[6646.58 --> 6653.08]  And someone in Flowplane Chat said, okay, but, or J-Cup in Flowplane Chat said, or you just don't live in a city.
[6653.22 --> 6658.16]  I think my counter for this is what I said right before that, which is it's not a good game.
[6658.16 --> 6663.14]  Like, if these things are true, Pokemon Go just sucks.
[6663.30 --> 6665.20]  Like, it's a bad game.
[6665.36 --> 6667.66]  The only benefit is that it gets you out walking.
[6667.80 --> 6675.60]  So if you can't, or if you live in an area where there's nothing to do by doing that, then honestly, I just think it's a bad game.
[6675.74 --> 6677.78]  And I wouldn't recommend playing it at all.
[6677.78 --> 6685.30]  I wouldn't recommend paying egregious amounts of money to be able to play it in a less effective manner.
[6686.72 --> 6687.12]  No.
[6687.36 --> 6689.64]  I just would recommend not playing it.
[6689.80 --> 6691.78]  Like, it's not a good game.
[6692.30 --> 6696.38]  Don't, go spend your time doing something more fun and engaging.
[6696.62 --> 6697.30]  I don't know.
[6697.40 --> 6700.72]  I don't, so that's, I think that's my defense for it is it just sucks.
[6700.92 --> 6705.32]  So you shouldn't go out of your way to spend more money playing a game that isn't very good from your couch.
[6705.32 --> 6709.24]  Instead of going out and walking, which makes the game good.
[6710.36 --> 6722.96]  Anyways, so now that I got that out of the way, I suspect the biggest win that they can have with the community and the biggest financial win that they can have is uncapping the amount of remote raid passes that you can use.
[6723.10 --> 6726.00]  Because I think right now it's capped at like three per day or something.
[6726.70 --> 6727.10]  Yeah.
[6727.10 --> 6732.84]  And the crazy thing to me is they cost, I don't know how much they cost, but I think they cost like more than a dollar each.
[6732.84 --> 6739.96]  And people rejoice when for special events they lift, they, I don't think they lift the cap, but they raise the cap to some higher amount.
[6740.50 --> 6742.36]  I'm going to say like 20 or something.
[6742.60 --> 6743.92]  And people get stoked.
[6744.96 --> 6758.24]  So like, I think they are going to do something that community wants and lift the cap on remote raids and they're going to make tons of money.
[6758.24 --> 6761.48]  I don't even think the game is the point.
[6761.72 --> 6763.44]  It's got to be, it's got to be the data.
[6765.06 --> 6771.20]  Because that from my understanding was the entire point of Ingress and Pokemon Go and all this stuff in the first place.
[6771.20 --> 6771.62]  The AR scans are crazy.
[6771.92 --> 6776.40]  There's benefits to routinely do AR scans of different areas.
[6776.74 --> 6779.18]  Like what is possibly the point of that?
[6779.24 --> 6781.10]  Unless you're trying to harvest some form of data.
[6781.10 --> 6784.12]  It's interesting to me that it's worth that much.
[6786.62 --> 6792.16]  Dude, the valuations of things in general are sort of baffling to me.
[6792.42 --> 6792.72]  Yeah.
[6793.34 --> 6795.66]  I don't think we actually said how much the deal was for.
[6795.70 --> 6796.88]  I thought it was 300 million though.
[6797.78 --> 6798.80]  I'm not sure.
[6798.88 --> 6800.06]  I don't think it.
[6800.30 --> 6800.98]  No, sorry, excuse me.
[6801.02 --> 6801.68]  Three and a half billion.
[6802.64 --> 6805.14]  Sorry, I was off by a decimal place.
[6806.34 --> 6806.98]  My goodness.
[6806.98 --> 6812.44]  I mean, there are still a crazy amount of Pokemon Go players.
[6812.70 --> 6816.88]  And I guarantee you that that game makes monster money.
[6818.02 --> 6819.96]  Just crazy amounts of money.
[6820.62 --> 6825.38]  Because like it's, it's I think generally easier for people to justify.
[6827.40 --> 6827.84]  Okay.
[6827.94 --> 6829.82]  The people that will go out and walk.
[6829.90 --> 6833.10]  I think it's easier for them to justify because they're like, oh, okay.
[6833.10 --> 6833.96]  This is, I don't know.
[6834.26 --> 6836.90]  I'm going to buy an event pass for this cool event day thing.
[6836.90 --> 6838.22]  It costs me like $6.
[6839.04 --> 6840.36]  I'm going to walk and do whatever.
[6840.50 --> 6842.06]  You compound that by enough people.
[6842.14 --> 6842.86]  That's a ton of money.
[6843.60 --> 6847.92]  And then you have the people that will just sit and remote raid like crazy.
[6848.02 --> 6851.50]  And that's wild amounts of money.
[6854.64 --> 6856.54]  Interestingly, they kept Ingress.
[6857.52 --> 6860.64]  So it's not like they're not still maintaining game code.
[6860.64 --> 6861.08]  Huh.
[6861.98 --> 6866.46]  So it's not like they're just like, yeah, we don't want to like make games anymore or something.
[6867.52 --> 6872.30]  So they only sold Pokemon Go, Monster Hunter Now, and Pikmin Bloom.
[6876.68 --> 6877.38]  That's weird.
[6877.38 --> 6880.90]  I wonder how many people even play Ingress still.
[6881.28 --> 6884.38]  I like, um...
[6884.38 --> 6885.66]  Whoa.
[6885.80 --> 6888.46]  Whiskey Nerd 88 says, I met my ex playing Pokemon Go.
[6888.88 --> 6894.70]  Last time I checked, I spent about $6,000 in the game, but have not spent any money on the game in years.
[6894.70 --> 6895.18]  Wow.
[6897.92 --> 6905.58]  And due to the nature of the game, if he hasn't played in years, his Pokemon probably aren't even that good anymore.
[6906.40 --> 6909.02]  Because there's constant power creep, right?
[6912.48 --> 6912.80]  Oh.
[6912.80 --> 6913.88]  I have friends who still play Ingress.
[6913.96 --> 6915.38]  I know people play it.
[6915.50 --> 6916.88]  I just, I wonder how many.
[6917.10 --> 6918.80]  Because you never really hear about it.
[6918.80 --> 6924.38]  As far as my understanding goes, the Ingress community is like probably not shrinking much anymore.
[6924.58 --> 6928.04]  Because you get to that point where it's like, these people are just going to play forever.
[6928.84 --> 6930.30]  But I wonder how many are left.
[6930.34 --> 6934.40]  Because like I played Ping Ingress back in like 2013 or something.
[6936.30 --> 6940.14]  And for the same reason then that I like Pokemon Go now, right?
[6940.16 --> 6941.24]  Like I liked the idea.
[6941.24 --> 6945.58]  I would walk around a city using Ingress as my guide.
[6945.58 --> 6951.74]  Because like it would bring you to interesting like statues or whatever else.
[6951.84 --> 6953.98]  Like you could use it to kind of bring you around the city.
[6957.24 --> 6958.16]  I don't know, man.
[6958.48 --> 6961.48]  It's interesting.
[6962.28 --> 6965.02]  I don't think they're going to make the game better for players like me.
[6965.12 --> 6966.30]  If they make any changes.
[6966.44 --> 6970.58]  I think they will make the game better for players that are not like me.
[6970.66 --> 6971.12]  But we'll see.
[6971.74 --> 6973.90]  Our discussion questions here are pretty interesting.
[6973.90 --> 6978.08]  I mean, is Savvy Games Group essentially just publicly funded private equity?
[6978.90 --> 6979.40]  Yes.
[6979.86 --> 6987.54]  I mean, you've got to remember that in the Middle East, like public funds are kind of like private funds.
[6987.96 --> 6988.54]  Is it not?
[6988.60 --> 6990.08]  I genuinely don't know anything about it.
[6990.12 --> 6993.98]  It's not like the Norwegian investment thing.
[6993.98 --> 7002.22]  I'm not convinced that the citizens get any benefit from this in the same way that the Norwegian one does.
[7002.98 --> 7012.90]  What I do wonder though is if North America is kind of behind the eight ball on the whole public private equity thing.
[7012.90 --> 7016.82]  There's been some talks about that from America, I think, recently.
[7018.00 --> 7018.48]  Yeah.
[7018.68 --> 7020.82]  Not Canada, I don't think, but America.
[7021.26 --> 7031.22]  I think getting some public investment funds that raise money off of natural resources makes a lot of sense.
[7031.22 --> 7033.66]  There are things that are kind of similar.
[7033.96 --> 7041.88]  Like, I know some of the teachers unions in Canada, for instance, invest their, like these pension funds are pretty big.
[7041.96 --> 7044.26]  And that's effectively public.
[7044.52 --> 7047.22]  They're all, it's all public servants who work for these unions, right?
[7047.28 --> 7048.50]  So it's kind of public funding.
[7048.60 --> 7050.22]  So like sort of, except that it's private.
[7050.22 --> 7054.26]  Like it's, it's clear that this is not just like a black and white thing.
[7054.36 --> 7056.18]  Is it private funding or is it public funding?
[7056.24 --> 7058.04]  There's a, there's kind of a spectrum here, but.
[7058.52 --> 7063.32]  I know you literally just said it, but I'm going to clarify because it is so insane.
[7063.32 --> 7065.70]  And I'm not necessarily sure you meant this directly.
[7065.70 --> 7072.42]  Do you know about the, on the Ontario teachers fund having $250 billion in net assets?
[7073.68 --> 7077.76]  I didn't know it was that much, but they like own an airport and stuff.
[7077.76 --> 7083.42]  Not even in Canada, like they're, they are wild.
[7084.88 --> 7085.58]  Gain teachers.
[7086.06 --> 7086.32]  Okay.
[7087.76 --> 7091.82]  Ontario teachers pension plan airport.
[7092.18 --> 7095.64]  Apparently it's the, Nutano says it's the biggest pension fund in the world.
[7095.76 --> 7096.86]  It's crazy.
[7097.44 --> 7100.72]  I don't know what's, they've just been popping off.
[7103.30 --> 7103.90]  Wow.
[7104.14 --> 7104.52]  All right.
[7105.94 --> 7106.32]  Okay.
[7106.32 --> 7107.86]  So it's not an airport.
[7108.10 --> 7108.94]  It's many airports.
[7109.12 --> 7115.32]  The Ontario teachers investment fund owns a substantial portfolio of infrastructure assets,
[7115.42 --> 7117.46]  including stakes in, okay, fair enough.
[7117.86 --> 7123.30]  Birmingham airport, Bristol airport, Copenhagen airport, and London city airport, as well as
[7123.30 --> 7125.46]  international water and power utilities.
[7126.26 --> 7129.52]  Like they are not chilling.
[7129.72 --> 7130.94]  They are going hard.
[7130.94 --> 7133.36]  All right.
[7134.16 --> 7134.60]  Wild.
[7135.98 --> 7136.98]  Oh, good on them.
[7137.72 --> 7142.14]  And yeah, someone posted, this seems like the Saudi is diversifying from oil and that
[7142.14 --> 7143.46]  is absolutely what they're doing.
[7143.52 --> 7147.50]  They're taking that oil money and they're putting it into stuff that will continue to
[7147.50 --> 7150.08]  grow as the world continues to electrify.
[7151.78 --> 7152.26]  100%.
[7152.26 --> 7160.36]  Now, our next question here is how do you feel about the sale of more and more art slash game
[7160.36 --> 7162.62]  slash culture to investment companies?
[7163.04 --> 7163.12]  Yeah.
[7163.32 --> 7166.64]  Deadmau5 just sold his catalog and label for 55 million.
[7167.26 --> 7169.30]  And it's like on the one hand, like get the bag.
[7169.30 --> 7175.76]  But on the other hand, Adam writes, I prefer companies investing in artists, not just like
[7175.76 --> 7177.10]  owning the art.
[7178.54 --> 7180.94]  And that's a really good point.
[7181.60 --> 7188.68]  And what I'll say is that the, you know, from the time that we got an offer for our company
[7188.68 --> 7199.44]  and our IP, the only real way that that happens is with these large private equity or union
[7199.44 --> 7201.96]  funded funds.
[7202.66 --> 7205.98]  They're the only ones that can afford what this stuff is worth.
[7206.14 --> 7208.00]  So that's the only real option to sell.
[7208.14 --> 7217.80]  I actually had, I had another topic in here that was sort of to, oh man, shoot, I forget.
[7217.80 --> 7225.50]  Well, I was going to get into it somehow, um, that it's really hard for Canadian companies
[7225.50 --> 7227.78]  to not get acquired by U S companies.
[7228.30 --> 7234.34]  And the same thing looks like it's starting to happen to, um, to Western companies.
[7234.74 --> 7235.40]  Oh yeah.
[7235.48 --> 7237.42]  No, it was, I was going to talk about it in this topic.
[7237.54 --> 7237.64]  Yeah.
[7237.64 --> 7241.96]  The same thing seems to be happening to Western companies getting acquired by like Saudi,
[7241.96 --> 7247.00]  um, um, wealth funds.
[7247.00 --> 7250.54]  And this is, this is often, um, not hostile.
[7251.66 --> 7253.94]  Um, like there's, there's agreed upon.
[7254.06 --> 7254.68]  I don't know.
[7254.80 --> 7256.10]  I haven't done enough research.
[7256.18 --> 7257.30]  The whole world's been on fire.
[7257.34 --> 7259.26]  It's been hard to properly stay on top of everything.
[7259.26 --> 7262.94]  So I don't know if this is true or not, but as far as my understanding goes, there's substantial
[7262.94 --> 7269.32]  evidence that our, our new prime minister up here in Canada, um, when I think it was when
[7269.32 --> 7273.82]  Trump took office, took significant steps to move an investment firm down to the States
[7273.82 --> 7274.64]  for tax breaks.
[7275.38 --> 7280.48]  Um, and now he's running our country, uh, whether that happened or not, I don't fully
[7280.48 --> 7280.70]  know.
[7280.70 --> 7283.68]  Well, I know that it happened, but I don't know if he was actually involved because there's
[7283.68 --> 7285.74]  some people saying that he had left before, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7285.80 --> 7286.12]  I don't know.
[7286.80 --> 7288.96]  Um, but like, this is, this is a thing.
[7289.02 --> 7293.00]  I mean, the, the Canadian brain drain is something that has been known about for a long time.
[7293.00 --> 7297.82]  You, you grow up here, you go to school here, you get a good education, you go, go get a
[7297.82 --> 7299.40]  job in the States cause you make way more money.
[7299.82 --> 7300.70]  Um, yep.
[7300.86 --> 7305.70]  And it seems like even a strategy where people will, will do that and then move back.
[7305.70 --> 7308.82]  Cause you, you make more money and the cost of living is lower.
[7308.82 --> 7310.16]  So you can save a bunch of money.
[7310.16 --> 7312.04]  Then you save a bunch of money and move back to Canada.
[7312.76 --> 7317.64]  Uh, um, for the healthcare and for the retirement.
[7317.64 --> 7325.24]  Um, but it's not just people, it's like entire companies and entire like art catalogs now.
[7325.32 --> 7330.80]  And it sort of looks like it's starting to happen to the U S now as well, where the, where
[7330.80 --> 7332.88]  things are just getting acquired and stripped out.
[7332.88 --> 7337.66]  And you've, you talked about 10 cent basically owning a piece of like everything, like every
[7337.66 --> 7340.86]  gaming, every gaming IP, every gaming company.
[7341.48 --> 7347.32]  Um, how do you, you know, how do you compete with that?
[7347.32 --> 7351.14]  I mean, it's economic, it's economic warfare at a certain point.
[7351.48 --> 7353.20]  I mean, I think it actually is.
[7353.30 --> 7353.46]  Yeah.
[7354.46 --> 7359.46]  Um, good luck everybody.
[7359.46 --> 7365.30]  What I will say is, um, there was no way that we were going to get the same offer for
[7365.30 --> 7374.96]  LMG from a Canadian investor or from a Canadian company, um, that we got from a U S based company.
[7374.96 --> 7381.36]  And these days I kind of doubt that we would get the same offer from a U S company that
[7381.36 --> 7386.08]  we could get from a Saudi backed company or a Chinese backed company.
[7386.82 --> 7387.62]  There's a question.
[7387.74 --> 7388.40]  There's a question.
[7388.88 --> 7392.84]  What if a Saudi backed company offered 150?
[7394.84 --> 7401.60]  Um, so far I have not even traveled there and it's not that it hasn't come up.
[7401.60 --> 7403.74]  What if, what if you wouldn't have to travel there?
[7403.84 --> 7404.58]  It's no problem.
[7404.94 --> 7409.48]  Well, no, it's not about the travel I'm saying so far we have had zero engagement.
[7409.90 --> 7410.52]  Got it.
[7410.66 --> 7418.78]  Um, I mean, look, I'm not going to pretend that I'm some kind of paragon of, of perfection.
[7418.78 --> 7421.32]  I think every man has a price.
[7421.44 --> 7427.02]  And I think that if you were to say anything other than that, every man has a price, that's,
[7427.12 --> 7429.68]  uh, I just don't think it's honest.
[7430.28 --> 7435.04]  Um, with that said, with that said, there are, there are still good people.
[7435.22 --> 7438.36]  Corey is the name says, and this is in float plane chat.
[7438.50 --> 7443.44]  My dad is selling his architecture firm to like a dozen plus of his employees and is taking
[7443.44 --> 7446.32]  a huge loss compared to offers he received from bigger fish.
[7446.32 --> 7447.36]  I think that's super cool.
[7447.68 --> 7453.48]  I think I've told the story already on the show about, um, my uncle's vet friend who
[7453.48 --> 7460.14]  owned a veterinary practice and could have sold to the like predatory corporate that that's
[7460.14 --> 7464.92]  been buying up all the vet practices and then hiking the prices in the lower mainland and
[7464.92 --> 7470.06]  instead sold to, to my friend, um, who is, who is running it now.
[7470.06 --> 7473.40]  Uh, Dr. Duff at, uh, Fraser Heights animal hospital.
[7473.40 --> 7477.78]  She is an amazing human being and deserved to get a good deal.
[7477.92 --> 7478.22]  Let's go.
[7478.40 --> 7480.16]  She paid, she paid a fair price.
[7480.26 --> 7484.92]  It wasn't that she was asking for handouts, but it was just that these, uh, equity backed
[7484.92 --> 7489.66]  companies can afford to pay three times, two or three times a fair price.
[7489.92 --> 7492.10]  And then they're just playing a long game.
[7492.90 --> 7493.42]  Yep.
[7493.52 --> 7495.60]  So they're not as worried about EBITDA.
[7495.60 --> 7498.56]  They're worried about owning every single option you can go to.
[7499.32 --> 7500.96]  Yes, exactly.
[7502.06 --> 7508.32]  Um, uh, Gremlin injector says your channel isn't the kind of business a pension fund would
[7508.32 --> 7509.28]  want to deal with managing.
[7509.74 --> 7512.06]  Um, your mistake is calling it a channel.
[7512.62 --> 7515.52]  Uh, the channel is less than half of our revenue.
[7515.52 --> 7520.08]  Now, uh, we're going to have a, an updated version of how does LMG make money pretty quick
[7520.08 --> 7525.58]  here, but I think you'll be surprised to discover that, um, we are running a company that's
[7525.58 --> 7526.42]  a company over here.
[7526.60 --> 7532.24]  It's very interesting to see people's, uh, sort of perspective on what it is that LMG
[7532.24 --> 7533.20]  is exactly.
[7534.14 --> 7535.18]  Um, yeah.
[7537.58 --> 7541.46]  We are absolutely the kind of thing that investors buy.
[7541.90 --> 7544.82]  We have just made the decision not to sell.
[7544.82 --> 7553.84]  Um, the only difference with that one offer was that it was, um, it was to a group that
[7553.84 --> 7557.24]  we were willing to hear out because they seemed not that crappy.
[7557.92 --> 7562.96]  And so it's the first time we ever actually got a number for the company because everyone
[7562.96 --> 7565.86]  else we've just kind of not even gotten that far with.
[7565.86 --> 7567.96]  Yeah.
[7568.02 --> 7570.10]  Rod Rosenberg says LMG is a tool company.
[7570.52 --> 7572.12]  We aren't not a tool company.
[7572.18 --> 7573.28]  I'll tell you that much for sure.
[7575.88 --> 7576.32]  Yeah.
[7576.98 --> 7579.74]  Offers are an interesting experience to go through.
[7579.74 --> 7589.68]  Um, even with zero intent to entertain, because it's interesting to see like what people put
[7589.68 --> 7597.62]  value on, um, like what, like what, that's an interesting conversation.
[7597.62 --> 7598.66]  Do you want to talk about that?
[7598.70 --> 7602.58]  Like what, what were they largely placing value on when they were buying?
[7602.70 --> 7604.52]  Um, a lot of it was creator warehouse.
[7604.68 --> 7604.94]  Yeah.
[7605.18 --> 7612.36]  Um, a lot of it was the institutional knowledge on the content creation side as well.
[7612.36 --> 7620.08]  Um, they wanted, um, they wanted our people in leadership positions, um, at some of their
[7620.08 --> 7620.96]  other IPs.
[7621.12 --> 7629.24]  They wanted, uh, our IPs to continue ticking and they wanted our, um, our experience and
[7629.24 --> 7636.22]  our expertise, um, diversifying our revenue from traditional creator revenue streams like
[7636.22 --> 7641.46]  AdSense and Patreon to building our own site like float plane.
[7641.46 --> 7646.42]  Although that, sorry, was a smaller part of it and especially expanding into merch.
[7648.00 --> 7653.72]  Um, see like that, but that, that experience is, is interesting, even if you're not willing
[7653.72 --> 7654.60]  to entertain the offer.
[7655.38 --> 7656.08]  I don't know.
[7656.18 --> 7656.76]  Oh, definitely.
[7657.32 --> 7657.74]  Definitely.
[7657.86 --> 7660.80]  Seeing what other people value about your company.
[7661.04 --> 7662.12]  A hundred percent.
[7662.22 --> 7666.58]  And when it's a purchasing offer, it's one of the few times that it's like probably going
[7666.58 --> 7668.50]  to be legit.
[7668.50 --> 7669.82]  Uh, yeah.
[7669.88 --> 7674.12]  And not just based on, it's not a job offer for me at that point.
[7674.12 --> 7677.90]  Like, I think I had a two year clause that I had to stay with the company, but that was
[7677.90 --> 7678.52]  it two years.
[7678.52 --> 7678.96]  Yeah.
[7679.10 --> 7682.06]  Which would be expired by now if we had taken it.
[7682.06 --> 7682.36]  Yeah.
[7682.72 --> 7688.18]  Um, top gear 1224 says, did you see the Mr. Beast business breakdown for the investment,
[7688.18 --> 7689.56]  uh, request?
[7689.84 --> 7691.92]  Uh, yeah, yeah, I did see that.
[7691.92 --> 7698.84]  Um, I am very surprised that Jimmy is still in like hyper growth, lose money mode, not
[7698.84 --> 7703.44]  because like, I don't think he's doing bigger and bigger things every time.
[7703.44 --> 7707.70]  And that's a big part of why you need to keep taking money and you keep losing money is because
[7707.70 --> 7711.38]  you kind of try to, to use the capital you have to do something even bigger.
[7711.38 --> 7714.26]  And, you know, you lose money as just sort of part of that process.
[7714.26 --> 7719.08]  But because I would think that he would at some point just go, okay, I'm worth a billion
[7719.08 --> 7720.10]  dollars at this point.
[7721.38 --> 7726.52]  Maybe this is big enough, but he, uh, he doesn't seem to have a limit to, to what he wants to
[7726.52 --> 7727.18]  build over there.
[7727.58 --> 7734.70]  And, uh, it looks like beast games was an absolutely enormous success for, um, for his company.
[7734.86 --> 7740.92]  So I think, uh, I think he's shopping another, another two seasons right now at the rumored
[7740.92 --> 7742.90]  price is 150 million a season.
[7742.90 --> 7744.04]  So, uh, good for him.
[7744.04 --> 7750.24]  Which is really fantastic for new media to be completely honest.
[7750.98 --> 7752.00]  A hundred percent.
[7752.64 --> 7756.90]  Well, like completely regardless of what you think of him or his company or anything like
[7756.90 --> 7762.20]  that, that is a very big step for new media because that's, that's a, there's a, there's
[7762.20 --> 7768.04]  a certain layer of like the big heads never took us seriously, even though we can take as
[7768.04 --> 7770.10]  many of their views as we want.
[7770.10 --> 7773.54]  We can take as much of their money, money as they want, et cetera.
[7773.54 --> 7778.16]  But we were never taken seriously as actual professional people who can perform.
[7778.70 --> 7783.56]  Um, and clearly it worked extremely well.
[7783.56 --> 7789.54]  So now it sounds like the, the rumblings that I'm seeing is that there's, there's a shift
[7789.54 --> 7790.10]  there now.
[7790.52 --> 7795.38]  Um, and they're looking actually specifically for content creators.
[7795.38 --> 7797.62]  I believe mostly specifically YouTubers.
[7798.14 --> 7803.86]  Um, but I'm sure content creators in general, I think I bet you would be YouTubers and streamers
[7803.86 --> 7807.44]  just because short format probably isn't going to transfer.
[7807.44 --> 7811.04]  YouTube is the closest thing to what they already do.
[7811.18 --> 7813.28]  And it's the easiest to understand.
[7813.76 --> 7813.82]  Yeah.
[7814.04 --> 7822.78]  Um, I mean, in a lot of ways we are, we are set up, um, not that differently from the other,
[7822.78 --> 7824.96]  the other creator companies.
[7824.96 --> 7828.82]  You know, you look at stuff like a dude, perfect, you look at stuff like Mr. Beast.
[7829.30 --> 7835.70]  Um, we're just operating at a much smaller scale.
[7835.98 --> 7836.34]  Yeah.
[7836.42 --> 7836.72]  Oh yeah.
[7836.76 --> 7837.02]  Yeah.
[7838.02 --> 7838.66]  For sure.
[7841.16 --> 7845.16]  Uh, top here says, yeah, his YouTube videos are still a loss, but chocolate is making money.
[7845.16 --> 7852.48]  Um, chocolate, the chocolate made less than I anticipated, like his net profit on it.
[7852.64 --> 7857.10]  It was on the lower side of what I would expected, but would have expected.
[7857.28 --> 7863.98]  But my approach to business building has always been sort of almost like anti growth.
[7864.16 --> 7869.48]  Like it's been very bootstrap, make sure it's sustainable at every stage.
[7869.48 --> 7872.58]  And that's not the way to achieve hyper growth.
[7872.98 --> 7878.40]  Um, whereas he is just like, he's like all in every time I think he's raised.
[7878.48 --> 7878.80]  What was it?
[7878.84 --> 7882.96]  Like $450 million or something unbelievable like that.
[7883.00 --> 7885.14]  We've raised zero dollars.
[7885.94 --> 7887.64]  Um, I'll give you a dollar.
[7888.58 --> 7890.60]  Oh, I'll raise you a dollar.
[7891.48 --> 7894.34]  Is it really an investment though?
[7894.46 --> 7897.00]  If previously your dollar, I gave you the dollar in the first place.
[7897.06 --> 7897.26]  Yeah.
[7897.26 --> 7899.04]  I'll give you, I'll give you back a dollar.
[7899.48 --> 7903.62]  Don't tell the CRA.
[7906.92 --> 7910.24]  Um, what was I going to say?
[7910.42 --> 7911.18]  I had something to say.
[7911.98 --> 7914.36]  Oh, uh, do you think a lot of that profit?
[7914.44 --> 7916.12]  Cause I mean, we've talked about this before.
[7916.12 --> 7920.38]  You think a lot of that less profit than you'd expect is just because he's like selling through
[7920.38 --> 7922.98]  places like Walmart and everybody's going to take their cut.
[7923.06 --> 7924.26]  So the distributor is taking their cut.
[7924.34 --> 7925.56]  Walmart is taking their cut, et cetera.
[7925.56 --> 7926.00]  Yeah.
[7926.00 --> 7926.64]  Yeah.
[7926.70 --> 7932.48]  We bring everything in house, which, uh, improves the sustainability of it from a business standpoint,
[7932.48 --> 7933.98]  because we're vertically integrated.
[7934.12 --> 7935.70]  We control our costs directly.
[7936.32 --> 7939.64]  Um, but massively reduces your, your growth.
[7939.64 --> 7958.34]  He like hires a team and pays a lot of people and middle persons and, um, and pays for a lot of infrastructure that achieves scale, but doesn't achieve, um, necessarily the same profitability for, for his company.
[7958.34 --> 7960.94]  Like, man, being in Walmart is insane.
[7961.28 --> 7962.12]  Like, think about this.
[7962.22 --> 7962.54]  Hold on.
[7962.64 --> 7962.96]  Hold on.
[7964.12 --> 7966.46]  Um, how many Walmart stores in America?
[7966.62 --> 7974.16]  I was talking, I was talking to someone about this recently because it was a really interesting perspective change for me.
[7974.16 --> 7980.34]  Uh, when I was, uh, I was talking to someone about like, uh, it's, this is back when I was at NCIX.
[7980.34 --> 7990.88]  I think I was talking to, um, not Taryn, but my other boss about like, you know, who cares if this brand is in, you know, Best Buy or they have their keyboard in Walmart.
[7991.14 --> 7993.08]  Like the stuff's not selling.
[7993.08 --> 7997.28]  I go in there and like the shelf, like display socks and this and that.
[7997.68 --> 8003.90]  And he's like, okay, Linus, look, Walmart has at this time, according to the AI overview.
[8004.16 --> 8005.72]  So take, take it for what it is.
[8006.06 --> 8013.14]  Walmart has 4,615 stores in the United States, including their super centers, discount stores and neighborhood markets.
[8013.62 --> 8015.52]  If you have your product in Walmart.
[8015.78 --> 8016.24]  Okay.
[8016.36 --> 8021.44]  So let's even take something as, as cheap as a chocolate bar.
[8021.44 --> 8024.40]  What's a feastable bar, like two bucks, something like that.
[8024.56 --> 8024.98]  No idea.
[8025.18 --> 8025.40]  Sure.
[8026.06 --> 8026.36]  Okay.
[8026.48 --> 8036.18]  So if every one of those stores sold just one feastable bar per day, which I think is pretty reasonable.
[8036.18 --> 8039.86]  So in the chat responded a little bit too quickly with $1.50.
[8040.92 --> 8041.88]  $1.50.
[8042.16 --> 8042.48]  Okay.
[8042.60 --> 8042.92]  All right.
[8043.04 --> 8044.56]  Well, someone else said $2.42.
[8044.62 --> 8045.52]  I have no idea.
[8046.76 --> 8047.48]  Times point.
[8047.68 --> 8047.96]  You know what?
[8047.98 --> 8049.06]  I'm going to, I'm going with $2.
[8049.34 --> 8050.28]  I'm trusting my instincts.
[8050.32 --> 8050.56]  Okay.
[8050.56 --> 8053.16]  So that's, that's 9230.
[8053.44 --> 8053.76]  Okay.
[8054.16 --> 8055.28]  Times 365.
[8056.16 --> 8062.28]  I think it's pretty, I think it's pretty fair to say that any Walmart would probably manage to sell one feastable bar a day.
[8062.40 --> 8064.14]  And if it didn't, it wouldn't be on the shelf.
[8064.44 --> 8064.88]  Okay.
[8064.88 --> 8075.52]  Times 365 means that if every Walmart location sold just one of these chocolate bars a day, it's a $3.3 million business.
[8077.02 --> 8077.50]  Okay.
[8080.56 --> 8081.62]  It is insane.
[8082.16 --> 8085.04]  The scale at which companies like this operate.
[8085.28 --> 8088.72]  Because as soon as you go, okay, yeah, they could probably sell 10 chocolate bars a day.
[8090.08 --> 8090.52]  Okay.
[8090.84 --> 8093.20]  Now it's a $33 million business.
[8095.00 --> 8096.66]  Probably they could sell more than 10.
[8096.66 --> 8098.94]  So just being in Walmart.
[8099.58 --> 8101.18]  Just being in Walmart at all.
[8101.18 --> 8104.58]  There's going to be specific locations where that 10 is a joke.
[8105.20 --> 8108.26]  There's going to be other locations where 10 might be a struggle, but like, yeah.
[8108.26 --> 8108.54]  Yeah.
[8108.54 --> 8117.02]  You are almost immediately, just by merit of having your product in Walmart stores, going to be a bigger company than LMG.
[8118.06 --> 8119.98]  And Creator Warehouse and Quote Plane.
[8120.36 --> 8123.20]  Like, assuming your product costs, let's say, you know, $10 or $20.
[8123.20 --> 8127.30]  Obviously, Walmart is taking a significant amount of that margin.
[8127.30 --> 8135.80]  But in terms of just the sheer amount of revenue, like, it is, dude, absolutely wild.
[8136.80 --> 8137.68]  Yeah.
[8137.68 --> 8148.28]  So good luck.
[8148.82 --> 8149.88]  Yeah, good luck, Jimmy.
[8150.26 --> 8152.34]  I forget what topic we're even on right now.
[8152.84 --> 8153.36]  Who knows?
[8154.84 --> 8155.38]  Who knows?
[8155.48 --> 8156.20]  That's not the point.
[8156.72 --> 8157.34]  iRobot.
[8158.12 --> 8158.60]  iRobot.
[8158.76 --> 8160.76]  More like die robot.
[8161.70 --> 8167.66]  Roomba maker iRobot claims that it is unclear if the company will be able to survive for the next time.
[8167.68 --> 8168.54]  12 months.
[8169.16 --> 8178.00]  Amazon was set to take over the company for $1.7 billion, but pulled out after scrutiny from both U.S. and European regulators.
[8178.42 --> 8190.86]  After Amazon abandoned the acquisition, the company cut more than 50% of its workforce, reduced inventory, and reorganized, but still posted a net loss of $146 million in 2024.
[8191.24 --> 8195.96]  And ended the year with $134 million in cash.
[8195.96 --> 8199.54]  iRobot just launched eight new vacuums.
[8204.32 --> 8210.64]  This is exactly why I didn't want to buy that robot sweeper thing for the badminton center.
[8210.78 --> 8215.68]  Remember the one that had a subscription and didn't work at all without the app and the subscription?
[8215.68 --> 8222.20]  Because I don't care how well your company is doing today.
[8222.36 --> 8234.56]  If you can be a market leader and then all of a sudden be in a position where it's unclear if you'll be able to survive the next 12 months, it can happen to anyone.
[8234.56 --> 8245.40]  Our discussion question here is, competitors seem to have overtaken Roomba in terms of price and innovation.
[8246.18 --> 8251.36]  How can big established players stay nimble to keep competitors from overtaking them?
[8251.42 --> 8253.38]  I mean, that's the innovator's dilemma, right?
[8253.38 --> 8257.88]  Is you don't want to cannibalize your own product line, so you don't.
[8258.22 --> 8260.02]  And then someone comes in and disrupts you.
[8261.32 --> 8263.82]  That's one of the things you've got to listen to Steve Jobs on, man.
[8263.94 --> 8264.60]  Just do it.
[8264.60 --> 8271.40]  There's, yeah, there's almost no companies that survive 100 years, man.
[8272.80 --> 8279.76]  Like, that's one of the reasons that I look at, like, cryogenic freezing, like preservation.
[8280.22 --> 8292.78]  And I'm like, dude, you understand that you are basically just, like, freezing your body in a freezer of a company that literally won't exist by the time any theoretical technology could exist.
[8292.78 --> 8294.92]  Anyway, that's a whole other thing.
[8296.00 --> 8296.40]  Yeah.
[8298.56 --> 8300.16]  I guess that's about it, guys.
[8300.30 --> 8300.78]  I don't know.
[8301.26 --> 8310.06]  I only dailyed a Roomba for a very short period of time because it was at my old house that had a sunken living room, so it just wasn't that useful for me because they couldn't do stairs yet.
[8311.14 --> 8313.86]  Does a Roomba really work without the app?
[8314.20 --> 8321.44]  Or are we just going to have millions and millions and millions of e-waste vacuum robots out there that just don't do anything after this?
[8322.78 --> 8325.74]  I have no idea, man.
[8326.58 --> 8327.42]  Anyone got a Roomba?
[8328.54 --> 8328.94]  Huh?
[8329.96 --> 8331.00]  Anyone got a Roomba?
[8331.36 --> 8331.88]  I don't.
[8332.74 --> 8338.06]  I'm just confused because, like, to me it just doesn't seem like the market should be that big for these things.
[8338.06 --> 8345.42]  Harris83 says you can manually press the clean button and it will zombie around for a while and then return to base.
[8346.54 --> 8348.74]  It does, but it loses all its smart functionality.
[8349.10 --> 8350.44]  Well, at least it still does something.
[8350.88 --> 8354.42]  Pavan says you can control an iRobot locally, especially with Home Assistant.
[8355.20 --> 8355.48]  Cool.
[8355.60 --> 8356.58]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[8361.58 --> 8361.94]  Yeah.
[8361.94 --> 8364.26]  The old ones definitely work without an app.
[8367.02 --> 8369.02]  Okay, I connect locally to my Home Assistant.
[8369.22 --> 8369.48]  Okay.
[8369.94 --> 8373.38]  Quite a few people talking about Home Assistant in here.
[8374.68 --> 8377.56]  But can it, yeah, can, what about all the mapping and stuff?
[8377.66 --> 8378.86]  Like, does any of that work?
[8378.86 --> 8389.10]  Yeah, like, if you're telling it to engage with the internet, it's not engaging with the internet.
[8391.34 --> 8393.68]  Yeah, getting new parts is going to be an issue, Weasel.
[8393.74 --> 8405.18]  With that said, I think the ecosystem for these iRobots out there is going to be big enough that it'll be in someone's best interest to produce replacement parts for them.
[8406.82 --> 8407.98]  No offline maps.
[8408.10 --> 8408.34]  Okay.
[8408.86 --> 8410.10]  Interesting.
[8411.40 --> 8411.58]  Yeah.
[8412.36 --> 8412.72]  J.K.
[8413.40 --> 8416.78]  Micro Center says, all the parts I buy for my room is from AliExpress already anyway.
[8417.28 --> 8418.40]  Well, maybe you're part of the problem.
[8418.46 --> 8419.14]  You ever think of that?
[8419.84 --> 8421.28]  How will iRobot survive?
[8421.92 --> 8426.06]  Well, I mean, that is why the American companies are dying.
[8426.42 --> 8428.10]  Because it's just all these...
[8430.50 --> 8436.72]  It's a bunch of Chinese companies just completely dominating robot vacuums, as far as my understanding goes.
[8436.72 --> 8438.36]  Oh, yeah.
[8438.36 --> 8439.12]  Yeah, 100%.
[8439.12 --> 8441.64]  I'm just confused.
[8441.64 --> 8446.22]  Like, we get a ton of, like, sponsor offers for robot vacuums and stuff, and I'm just confused.
[8446.30 --> 8447.68]  Are that many people buying them?
[8447.68 --> 8450.70]  I don't see that many people with them.
[8450.70 --> 8453.46]  Like, I just...
[8453.46 --> 8454.04]  Every time...
[8454.04 --> 8455.74]  And it's been a while, in fairness.
[8456.50 --> 8465.82]  But every time I tried to daily one, I just found that it was more work manually faffing about with it than it would be to...
[8465.82 --> 8468.38]  But I have a built-in vac, so maybe that's part of it.
[8468.38 --> 8476.24]  But it was more work to faff about with the robot than to just, like, grab the vacuum hose and do a quick vacuum, so...
[8476.24 --> 8478.02]  What are you doing faffing about with the robot?
[8479.22 --> 8479.86]  Like, I want...
[8479.86 --> 8480.74]  I want to...
[8480.74 --> 8481.00]  I want to...
[8481.00 --> 8481.86]  Empting a little train.
[8482.36 --> 8483.18]  You don't have to do anything.
[8483.20 --> 8486.66]  Getting it unstuck on, like, the fluffy carpet we had.
[8486.74 --> 8487.62]  Like, I don't know, just stuff.
[8487.62 --> 8493.64]  Like, going and fixing the parts that it, like, doesn't reach or dust bunnies accumulate.
[8495.02 --> 8498.44]  These days are living in apartments that don't even really have carpeted areas.
[8499.62 --> 8500.92]  I mean, yeah, fair enough.
[8501.24 --> 8507.30]  I mean, the early ones didn't really, like, handle going under chairs and around chair legs and stuff very well.
[8507.60 --> 8508.46]  So there was just...
[8508.46 --> 8510.52]  There was a lot of manual cleaning left over afterward.
[8510.64 --> 8511.90]  It just didn't really save me much time.
[8512.14 --> 8513.60]  But, like I said, it's been a while.
[8513.60 --> 8518.80]  The one that I won from the Christmas party has saved tons of time for us, to be honest.
[8518.94 --> 8522.20]  Because the whole birds are really messy thing.
[8522.78 --> 8525.60]  They're really messy, but they're also...
[8525.60 --> 8526.58]  It's...
[8526.58 --> 8527.12]  Kind of contained.
[8527.50 --> 8527.92]  Yeah.
[8528.16 --> 8529.30]  It's not an incredible...
[8529.30 --> 8530.58]  Like, it's not disgusting.
[8530.98 --> 8537.76]  It's just a lot of, like, little poofs of feather or dandruff or whatever else.
[8538.34 --> 8543.08]  Little budgie poops that are just, like, dots of very easy to vacuum up whatever.
[8543.60 --> 8544.16]  Um...
[8544.16 --> 8546.26]  So it's very easy for it to do.
[8546.42 --> 8550.02]  But if you don't deal with it, it's, like, kind of gross and builds up.
[8550.16 --> 8553.98]  But if you just have the vacuum just run by every day, it's, like, it's fine.
[8555.02 --> 8555.26]  Yep.
[8555.28 --> 8555.68]  Fair enough.
[8556.88 --> 8557.28]  Yeah.
[8557.40 --> 8558.04]  I don't know.
[8558.34 --> 8559.78]  They're really expensive, though.
[8559.78 --> 8560.70]  Like, I...
[8560.70 --> 8565.98]  My theory on the whole robot vacuum sponsor thing was just that they were so profitable.
[8566.34 --> 8568.64]  Like, I just looked up best vacuum cleaner.
[8568.64 --> 8569.84]  And there's some Verge article.
[8569.96 --> 8572.12]  And the top one is 40% off.
[8573.06 --> 8573.54]  Um...
[8573.54 --> 8575.62]  Yeah.
[8575.82 --> 8576.62]  It's 40% off.
[8576.72 --> 8577.88]  It's still over $1,000.
[8578.52 --> 8579.10]  We have a whole...
[8579.10 --> 8581.84]  We have a whole video coming on that very soon.
[8581.92 --> 8584.04]  Just, like, listicles and...
[8584.04 --> 8584.62]  Ah, fair enough.
[8584.62 --> 8589.96]  Uh, affiliate revenue and how that whole big discounts, how that whole thing works.
[8590.20 --> 8591.88]  I also think...
[8591.88 --> 8593.82]  Here, let's see what ratings says.
[8593.90 --> 8594.98]  Because doesn't...
[8594.98 --> 8598.32]  I think ratings does robot vacuums and I'd trust them.
[8598.50 --> 8600.74]  But I don't trust the listicles.
[8600.86 --> 8601.44]  Robot vacuums.
[8601.50 --> 8601.68]  Okay.
[8601.86 --> 8603.74]  Did they also say Roborock is the best?
[8603.86 --> 8604.36]  Let's see.
[8604.36 --> 8608.36]  Um...
[8610.42 --> 8610.72]  Yep.
[8610.96 --> 8611.30]  Okay.
[8611.52 --> 8612.00]  Fair enough.
[8613.34 --> 8614.80]  Because, like, I...
[8614.80 --> 8617.84]  Well, they do for best vacuum for pet hair.
[8618.10 --> 8620.38]  The first one that came up was Roborock S8 Pro Ultra.
[8620.88 --> 8623.28]  I was thinking, like, I see Roborock everywhere.
[8623.46 --> 8623.94]  Like, is this...
[8623.94 --> 8625.26]  Are they just buying position or what?
[8626.16 --> 8626.44]  Dude.
[8626.68 --> 8626.92]  Dude.
[8627.54 --> 8627.90]  Dude.
[8628.34 --> 8629.02]  I've got...
[8629.02 --> 8630.06]  This is huge.
[8630.22 --> 8631.10]  Sorry, I just saw this.
[8631.84 --> 8633.92]  Microsoft teases Copilot for gaming.
[8633.92 --> 8634.72]  Oh, no.
[8635.44 --> 8635.76]  Jesus.
[8637.72 --> 8638.44]  All right.
[8638.44 --> 8640.00]  I heard Dan laugh in the background.
[8640.26 --> 8640.58]  Yeah.
[8641.60 --> 8642.80]  You got me, too.
[8644.44 --> 8649.04]  Yesterday, Microsoft announced that they are preparing to add AI to their gaming platforms
[8649.04 --> 8654.78]  in the form of Copilot for gaming, which they call the ultimate gaming sidekick.
[8655.74 --> 8660.04]  They then showed off some potential use cases, like what to do next in Minecraft,
[8660.64 --> 8663.60]  a recap of a player's previous progress in Age of Empires 4,
[8663.92 --> 8666.46]  and bringing up a strategy guide to defeat a boss.
[8667.86 --> 8668.74]  This is a quote.
[8668.92 --> 8672.18]  Gaming is the only form of entertainment where you can get stuck.
[8673.10 --> 8673.26]  Wait.
[8673.32 --> 8675.70]  And they seem to think their AI companion can help with that.
[8676.20 --> 8678.92]  Microsoft also showed off an admittedly pretty cool demo
[8678.92 --> 8683.02]  where Copilot for gaming told a player what character to choose in Overwatch 2
[8683.02 --> 8685.62]  and then offered advice after they died, like,
[8685.88 --> 8686.82]  you pushed up too far.
[8687.06 --> 8688.50]  Consider falling back to your teammates.
[8689.22 --> 8693.52]  If the final product manages to actually do this, it could be interesting,
[8693.74 --> 8696.34]  but we'll have to wait to see how it actually performs in the real world.
[8696.34 --> 8699.52]  Video game publications were quick to ask the question,
[8699.76 --> 8703.02]  hey, how exactly is it getting its information and from where?
[8703.94 --> 8705.00]  This is from Polygon.
[8705.32 --> 8709.38]  Voicing concerns that Microsoft has just sifted through all of the guides that they made
[8709.38 --> 8711.64]  and threw that info into an LLM.
[8711.64 --> 8715.04]  This is an Alex topic.
[8715.04 --> 8715.40]  It probably did.
[8716.54 --> 8718.82]  In the official Xbox podcast about this,
[8718.92 --> 8721.60]  there were multiple times where the host said things like,
[8721.94 --> 8724.02]  my mom has been getting really into gaming.
[8724.82 --> 8728.58]  So I think so many times Copilot could just answer this question for her.
[8729.14 --> 8733.96]  It's like, bro, your mom probably is just using games as a way to connect with you.
[8734.06 --> 8737.06]  An AI assistant sounds like it would make it a lonelier experience for her.
[8737.12 --> 8737.38]  Yeah.
[8737.54 --> 8738.04]  Yeah, thanks.
[8738.04 --> 8741.48]  That's the whole reason I don't like this.
[8741.66 --> 8745.54]  So great, perfect way to lay it out, Alex.
[8745.60 --> 8746.34]  I appreciate that.
[8746.98 --> 8748.32]  Thanks for playing with me, mom.
[8748.64 --> 8750.32]  Actually, I don't want to explain this to you.
[8750.40 --> 8751.58]  Can you just ask the AI?
[8757.58 --> 8760.04]  This is the same, like...
[8762.04 --> 8764.86]  I don't know.
[8764.86 --> 8768.82]  It's planned to be available to insiders this April.
[8769.10 --> 8770.30]  But our discussion question.
[8770.42 --> 8772.46]  Forget about what it can do here.
[8772.76 --> 8776.14]  What would you like a gaming AI companion to do?
[8779.36 --> 8781.48]  In single player games...
[8782.48 --> 8783.16]  Yes.
[8783.16 --> 8797.86]  It could be fun if there were more dynamic and lively AI buddies, I guess.
[8798.50 --> 8805.72]  Like, something I thought about is if you were playing, like, a squad-based combat game of some sort...
[8805.72 --> 8807.36]  Sure.
[8807.60 --> 8808.78]  And some rainbow sticks.
[8808.78 --> 8809.34]  Yeah.
[8809.90 --> 8815.42]  But you didn't have to do keyboard commands or whatever to, like, you know, okay, I have to walk up to the door.
[8815.72 --> 8819.76]  Then I have to look at the left side of the door and be like, okay, you guys stack up here.
[8819.86 --> 8821.86]  And then go, ugh, they went in the wrong order.
[8822.00 --> 8824.08]  So I need to get this guy out, get this guy out.
[8824.40 --> 8827.26]  And you're sitting there doing all these keyboard commands in front of the door.
[8827.30 --> 8828.20]  And then finally, okay.
[8828.70 --> 8830.32]  And then you press whatever button.
[8830.40 --> 8831.70]  And then things don't go properly.
[8831.80 --> 8832.36]  And it's really annoying.
[8832.36 --> 8838.14]  I find a lot of times when you have multi-unit control in a single player game, things can get a little tedious.
[8838.72 --> 8839.60]  And if you could just voice command...
[8839.60 --> 8841.40]  But you're talking about built into games.
[8841.50 --> 8841.86]  It would be sweet.
[8841.88 --> 8842.70]  This is co-pilot.
[8842.88 --> 8844.06]  Yeah, I don't want that at all.
[8844.32 --> 8847.00]  I don't want co-pilot even a little bit, I think.
[8847.56 --> 8850.00]  Mr. Wizard in float plane chat has a good one.
[8850.78 --> 8851.12]  All right.
[8851.20 --> 8851.46]  AI.
[8852.34 --> 8853.38]  That was a sick shot, bro.
[8853.52 --> 8856.36]  Want me to throw that clip on a timeline for you?
[8857.14 --> 8857.98]  That's pretty good.
[8858.82 --> 8859.72]  That's a use case.
[8859.72 --> 8862.56]  I probably want it to shut the hell up.
[8862.60 --> 8865.62]  Because if I just made a sick shot, I'm probably trying to make another one.
[8866.02 --> 8867.40]  And I want to be able to listen.
[8867.72 --> 8869.08]  Don't talk to me right now.
[8870.42 --> 8871.48]  I mean, just...
[8871.48 --> 8872.52]  I'm trying to focus.
[8873.74 --> 8875.32]  I just got my clip.
[8875.48 --> 8877.74]  And I would like to try to get another shot.
[8877.84 --> 8881.26]  And then when I'm done, I can go bump-a-dump and get my clip myself.
[8881.26 --> 8883.50]  Because it just recorded the last 20 minutes.
[8883.66 --> 8885.16]  Because I have Shadowplay enabled.
[8885.26 --> 8886.00]  Because why not?
[8887.24 --> 8887.60]  Okay.
[8887.80 --> 8888.12]  Okay.
[8888.38 --> 8888.86]  I do not need it.
[8888.86 --> 8889.98]  If anyone else has anything...
[8889.98 --> 8890.76]  Sick shot, bro!
[8890.78 --> 8891.44]  Get us in the chat.
[8891.76 --> 8892.08]  Sick shot!
[8892.08 --> 8892.76]  Get us in the chat.
[8896.36 --> 8897.90]  Hey, Xbox, clip that.
[8900.60 --> 8902.26]  Yeah, they've got nothing else, man.
[8902.86 --> 8904.42]  Yeah, because there isn't anything else.
[8904.50 --> 8905.34]  Because it's just...
[8905.34 --> 8907.70]  There's this whole concept of...
[8908.62 --> 8910.64]  And I don't remember who popularized it or whatever.
[8910.64 --> 8912.64]  But there's this whole concept that...
[8912.64 --> 8922.50]  When a medium gets surpassed, its flaws will be romanticized.
[8922.50 --> 8926.38]  And will be almost immediately emulated.
[8926.38 --> 8932.16]  So, like, if somebody didn't like something about a certain medium.
[8932.16 --> 8935.22]  If somebody didn't like that there was a very limited range...
[8935.22 --> 8935.54]  Too much drain.
[8935.54 --> 8936.70]  In 8-bit music.
[8937.56 --> 8940.54]  People will go back and try to make it.
[8940.74 --> 8941.34]  Or film grain.
[8941.44 --> 8942.24]  Or something like that.
[8942.62 --> 8946.44]  We are currently living in an era where people are trying to find retro cameras.
[8947.12 --> 8952.56]  Because they like the feeling that the retro cameras are able to create.
[8952.56 --> 8956.62]  When you lose this, you lose...
[8956.62 --> 8959.80]  Perfection is, in some ways, a loss of character.
[8960.08 --> 8964.46]  You lose these interesting tidbits of this thing that you made.
[8965.08 --> 8969.62]  So, this is something that I constantly complain about.
[8969.62 --> 8971.62]  Like, I've talked about how...
[8971.62 --> 8976.24]  You know, when computer stuff was more volatile.
[8976.62 --> 8978.06]  When it was more difficult.
[8978.24 --> 8979.74]  When parts failed more often.
[8979.74 --> 8982.28]  When we had liquid caps and you had to try to fix that.
[8982.28 --> 8984.08]  And when things went wrong all the time.
[8984.08 --> 8985.28]  And it was kind of hard.
[8985.48 --> 8986.70]  It was more interesting.
[8986.80 --> 8987.38]  It was more engaging.
[8987.50 --> 8988.78]  It was a better hobby.
[8989.08 --> 8990.22]  In my opinion, objectively.
[8990.44 --> 8991.26]  It's still cool.
[8992.52 --> 8994.30]  But in my opinion, it was just better.
[8996.36 --> 8997.72]  SLI was, like, kind of junk.
[8997.84 --> 8998.56]  But it was interesting.
[8999.60 --> 9000.36]  It was fun.
[9000.46 --> 9000.80]  It was unique.
[9001.00 --> 9002.36]  And maybe better is a strong word.
[9002.40 --> 9003.74]  But we could say more interesting.
[9003.84 --> 9004.36]  More interesting.
[9004.52 --> 9005.00]  More enjoyable.
[9005.88 --> 9009.32]  To someone with my interests and my personality better.
[9009.32 --> 9010.50]  Maybe not better for everyone.
[9010.76 --> 9011.76]  But better for me, at least.
[9012.28 --> 9014.96]  Um, you have this, this, like, marching forward.
[9015.04 --> 9015.82]  Where things get worse.
[9016.12 --> 9017.06]  Internet gets better.
[9017.38 --> 9019.46]  Land parties are almost killed.
[9020.34 --> 9021.26]  Because why bother?
[9021.26 --> 9022.32]  We're going to bring them back, Luke.
[9022.66 --> 9023.66]  We're bringing them back.
[9023.80 --> 9024.88]  And that's cool.
[9024.88 --> 9025.20]  Don't even worry, brother.
[9025.42 --> 9029.46]  Because we are romanticizing the bad parts of something in the past.
[9029.52 --> 9030.64]  That created something good.
[9030.64 --> 9031.80]  That we find endearing.
[9031.86 --> 9032.42]  Which is great.
[9032.78 --> 9033.42]  And I like that.
[9033.46 --> 9034.58]  Because we're bringing back land parties.
[9034.66 --> 9035.36]  Land parties are dope.
[9035.62 --> 9036.98]  But land parties started to die.
[9036.98 --> 9038.18]  When the internet got too good.
[9038.18 --> 9045.74]  But I genuinely think people enjoy playing games together online less than just doing the land party.
[9046.42 --> 9047.86]  I 100% agree.
[9048.10 --> 9049.52]  And I think we have to find a...
[9049.52 --> 9051.40]  Sorry, I'll let you finish this bit.
[9051.48 --> 9053.02]  But I've got to talk to you about something after.
[9053.26 --> 9054.98]  No, I'm, like, effectively done.
[9055.08 --> 9055.44]  It's just...
[9055.44 --> 9055.98]  This is...
[9055.98 --> 9056.18]  Okay.
[9056.18 --> 9057.06]  It's just...
[9057.06 --> 9058.54]  It's fearful for me.
[9058.58 --> 9063.64]  Because I see this reducing online co-op gameplay.
[9063.82 --> 9064.80]  Or playing with your friends.
[9064.86 --> 9065.94]  And, like, hey, I want to pick up this game.
[9065.98 --> 9066.92]  You've been playing it for a while.
[9067.24 --> 9069.58]  Do you want to, like, watch me play for a bit and help me get better?
[9069.64 --> 9071.56]  Or can we play together so I can learn from you or whatever?
[9071.90 --> 9075.14]  That's going to disappear when people are like, ugh, just play with Copilot for a while.
[9075.20 --> 9075.88]  And then play with me.
[9075.88 --> 9076.70]  I don't want to carry you.
[9077.08 --> 9078.66]  And it's like, man, that sucks.
[9079.38 --> 9079.76]  So much.
[9079.76 --> 9081.86]  I was playing Vampire Survivors last night.
[9082.46 --> 9088.32]  And it occurred to me that there's, like, there's one coffin I'm trying to find or something.
[9088.72 --> 9088.92]  Sure.
[9089.24 --> 9090.98]  And, like, I couldn't, like, find it.
[9091.02 --> 9092.66]  I couldn't figure out how to get over to it.
[9092.76 --> 9094.02]  And I was, like, frustrated.
[9094.48 --> 9098.04]  And when I was reading through this topic, I was like, oh, yeah, that could totally help me with that.
[9098.04 --> 9100.96]  Or it could advise me, like, which weapon to take.
[9101.92 --> 9109.74]  Because, you know, I saw already earlier in this playthrough that it's companion one for the upgrade.
[9109.76 --> 9112.04]  It's, like, one of the ones that's getting rolled.
[9112.40 --> 9116.14]  So I should take this one so it could, you know, like, there's things that it could observe.
[9116.32 --> 9120.06]  But, like, I've gone out of my way in that game to, like, not look anything up.
[9120.16 --> 9122.36]  So I've been able to kind of discover it as I go.
[9122.92 --> 9125.98]  And I could look something up.
[9126.08 --> 9134.74]  And I just feel like, you know, for me, the voyage of discovery is such a big part of the joy of playing a game.
[9135.18 --> 9137.26]  But maybe, you know, maybe that's just old-fashioned.
[9137.26 --> 9139.90]  And maybe people are going to look at...
[9139.90 --> 9141.72]  The, like, high-quality joy.
[9141.86 --> 9144.26]  Which is, I think, another somewhat...
[9144.98 --> 9150.72]  I'm sure people can make this argument for previous things as well.
[9150.78 --> 9156.20]  But I think this is somewhat of a modern problem where there's, like, a lot of low-quality dopamine.
[9156.44 --> 9156.50]  Yeah.
[9156.60 --> 9157.52]  Low-quality joy.
[9157.82 --> 9158.90]  That weak hit.
[9159.26 --> 9159.52]  Yeah.
[9159.52 --> 9160.26]  That weak dopamine hit.
[9160.26 --> 9161.76]  Weak but constant, right?
[9161.76 --> 9164.04]  Like, it's that thing that I was just describing with the LAN party.
[9164.14 --> 9165.46]  Like, you have to do a lot of work.
[9165.82 --> 9168.44]  Especially if you're not just going to one.
[9168.56 --> 9169.60]  Like, if you have to...
[9169.60 --> 9173.46]  If you're just doing one at your buddy's house or whatever, you have to, you know, bring tables over.
[9173.56 --> 9174.14]  Bring chairs over.
[9174.22 --> 9175.18]  Bring your whole computer over.
[9175.28 --> 9176.10]  Do all these types of things.
[9176.24 --> 9176.82]  Set everything up.
[9176.88 --> 9177.64]  Network everything together.
[9177.74 --> 9178.40]  There's all these steps.
[9178.60 --> 9179.12]  It's work.
[9179.46 --> 9181.32]  But then the hit is strong.
[9181.70 --> 9181.94]  Right?
[9182.08 --> 9182.56]  Like, it's...
[9182.56 --> 9182.66]  Yeah.
[9182.76 --> 9183.56]  It's really cool.
[9183.64 --> 9184.50]  The heights are really high.
[9184.54 --> 9185.56]  You're going to remember this stuff forever.
[9185.56 --> 9190.00]  If you're just co-op playing games online or competitive playing games online with your buddy.
[9190.00 --> 9194.58]  Like, that Halo round that was, like, one with two seconds to spare or whatever.
[9194.72 --> 9194.98]  Ever.
[9195.16 --> 9195.92]  Never forget it.
[9196.24 --> 9196.48]  Never.
[9196.48 --> 9197.20]  That was crazy.
[9197.32 --> 9197.52]  Yeah.
[9197.60 --> 9198.36]  That was crazy.
[9198.56 --> 9198.80]  Yeah.
[9199.54 --> 9201.72]  But it's, like, it's...
[9201.72 --> 9205.30]  That exact same scenario could happen purely online.
[9205.90 --> 9206.82]  And it would be cool.
[9207.68 --> 9208.02]  But it's not the same.
[9208.02 --> 9208.92]  Yeah, but no one else was there.
[9209.06 --> 9209.60]  It's not the same.
[9209.62 --> 9211.02]  So you lose that social element.
[9211.02 --> 9211.70]  You're...
[9211.70 --> 9215.32]  The microphone from the person who's screaming and cheering is getting auto-gained.
[9215.32 --> 9215.64]  Yeah.
[9215.64 --> 9215.80]  Yeah.
[9216.52 --> 9216.84]  Yeah.
[9216.84 --> 9218.50]  You're not seeing the physical presence of people.
[9218.68 --> 9221.06]  I think it's, like, 70% of communication is body language.
[9221.16 --> 9222.10]  You're not seeing any of it.
[9222.10 --> 9222.96]  Like, it's just...
[9222.96 --> 9223.10]  Yeah.
[9223.12 --> 9224.44]  It's not the same.
[9224.54 --> 9226.16]  You're diluting the experience.
[9226.36 --> 9226.98]  And I just...
[9226.98 --> 9229.24]  This type of stuff, just...
[9229.24 --> 9231.08]  It's just dread for me.
[9231.22 --> 9234.20]  It's just, like, damn, we're losing another thing.
[9234.32 --> 9235.60]  That's all it feels like.
[9236.26 --> 9236.46]  Okay.
[9236.58 --> 9239.40]  So here's something I want to figure out for WhaleLand.
[9239.40 --> 9240.24]  Um...
[9240.24 --> 9249.16]  Because one of the best experiences for me, gaming-wise, is, like, sitting all together,
[9249.76 --> 9251.34]  having the teams sit together.
[9251.82 --> 9252.56]  You know what I mean?
[9254.46 --> 9255.32]  Yeah, I really like that.
[9255.32 --> 9257.52]  Obviously, there's things that kind of suck about it.
[9258.44 --> 9260.40]  You know, Mike Bleed or, you know, whatever, right?
[9260.40 --> 9262.10]  Like, you can find issues with it.
[9262.60 --> 9263.40]  But...
[9263.40 --> 9271.90]  Like, I want to do, like, some team games where we literally go, okay, I know you have all
[9271.90 --> 9273.04]  your stuff set up over there.
[9273.96 --> 9274.64]  Too bad.
[9275.78 --> 9276.78]  Pick up your computer.
[9277.40 --> 9278.96]  The first eight people...
[9278.96 --> 9279.62]  Pick up your computer.
[9279.62 --> 9285.38]  ...who have their computers at these desks, at this desk, and the first eight people that
[9285.38 --> 9289.04]  have their computers across from them, we're playing.
[9289.60 --> 9290.20]  Let's go.
[9290.20 --> 9293.76]  We're playing Halo CE, or we're playing, you know, whatever, right?
[9294.56 --> 9296.84]  Um, we're playing words on again, or whatever.
[9296.84 --> 9301.16]  It's just gonna be laptop and Steam Deck users that just run over and win immediately.
[9302.36 --> 9303.52]  Ah, okay, whatever.
[9303.64 --> 9304.06]  We'll have to...
[9304.06 --> 9305.28]  I like the concept, though.
[9305.44 --> 9306.96]  I'm down with the general concept.
[9307.72 --> 9307.84]  Yeah.
[9307.92 --> 9309.76]  Yeah, I want to not sell every seat.
[9310.22 --> 9312.40]  I want to have, like, a reserved area.
[9312.70 --> 9313.58]  So, um...
[9313.58 --> 9315.50]  And I don't care if anyone else cares about it.
[9315.50 --> 9317.48]  Because for me, it's like, when someone...
[9317.48 --> 9319.94]  When you get someone, I want to be able to stand up.
[9319.94 --> 9322.18]  And be like, got him!
[9322.34 --> 9322.62]  You know?
[9322.94 --> 9324.86]  Like, I want to be able to look them in the eye.
[9325.40 --> 9326.78]  And vice versa.
[9327.02 --> 9328.54]  Like, I genuinely...
[9328.54 --> 9332.84]  I enjoy the trash talk element of LAN gaming.
[9333.04 --> 9336.16]  Whether it's directed at me, or whether it's directed at other people.
[9336.16 --> 9337.94]  It adds so much energy to it.
[9338.84 --> 9345.60]  Um, and so I want to find a way to have the small LAN experience, where everybody's playing
[9345.60 --> 9346.28]  the same game.
[9346.36 --> 9348.54]  You're effectively all packed in a room playing together.
[9349.18 --> 9352.24]  Within a big LAN that has over 200 people at it.
[9352.44 --> 9353.68]  That's what I want to figure out.
[9354.16 --> 9354.36]  Yeah.
[9354.84 --> 9355.16]  I, um...
[9355.86 --> 9359.38]  Pax, in its LAN prime, in my opinion.
[9359.38 --> 9360.26]  Not to...
[9360.26 --> 9362.00]  Not to pun with the prime thing.
[9362.50 --> 9363.14]  Um...
[9363.14 --> 9366.12]  They had tournament tables.
[9366.78 --> 9368.04]  So they would have...
[9368.04 --> 9369.46]  Generally, it was five.
[9369.60 --> 9370.76]  So they'd have five computers.
[9370.86 --> 9371.36]  And they did...
[9371.36 --> 9372.96]  They did back-to-back monitors.
[9373.34 --> 9376.14]  So you'd have one team on one side, the other team on the other side.
[9376.40 --> 9378.84]  So if you stood up, you're looking at the other team.
[9379.04 --> 9381.00]  And they'd have a section that was like that.
[9381.16 --> 9386.00]  Or they would have a stage, and it was five on one side, five on the other side.
[9386.02 --> 9386.74]  So it's all flat.
[9386.88 --> 9391.36]  But then there would be, like, the big screen that shows the, like, spectator view, or the
[9391.36 --> 9393.16]  commentators, or whatever, would be in the middle.
[9393.30 --> 9394.50]  And the team's on each side.
[9394.88 --> 9398.34]  Or you're off on the side, and you're just facing each other.
[9398.74 --> 9400.06]  And they used to do that a lot.
[9400.12 --> 9401.22]  And it was sick.
[9401.22 --> 9403.22]  And it was the...
[9403.22 --> 9407.30]  This is all a part of the, like...
[9407.30 --> 9408.36]  It matters, man.
[9408.40 --> 9409.30]  I swear it matters.
[9409.44 --> 9412.90]  I know it's, like, weird, and it seems, like, romanticized and sensationalized.
[9412.94 --> 9413.90]  But I swear it matters.
[9414.18 --> 9419.40]  When it's your team's turn, and you and all your buddies that are singing in one part all
[9419.40 --> 9424.68]  have to stand up and, like, leave your kit and walk over to this other area.
[9424.92 --> 9429.80]  And now you know, like, that team's on the same computers as we are.
[9429.80 --> 9431.40]  They have the same peripherals as us.
[9431.40 --> 9433.76]  We're sitting on a LAN connection.
[9434.12 --> 9437.18]  And it's, like, me and the boys, or me and whoever.
[9437.20 --> 9437.88]  No excuses.
[9438.36 --> 9443.06]  And, like, just the walk over is such a psychological moment.
[9444.28 --> 9444.72]  Yeah.
[9444.72 --> 9447.82]  Of, like, you and your friends you've been playing games with for years or whatever,
[9448.32 --> 9453.38]  effectively marching over to this other side to put it on the line against these other guys.
[9453.50 --> 9456.90]  In some game you've probably never even played or haven't played in years.
[9456.90 --> 9459.24]  And these other guys across the table, who knows?
[9459.34 --> 9459.84]  Maybe they have.
[9459.92 --> 9460.46]  Maybe they haven't.
[9460.52 --> 9463.74]  But, like, you're so invested in that moment.
[9463.82 --> 9464.90]  It's so sick.
[9465.06 --> 9470.84]  Like, I remember just so many of those because we would sign up for a ton of tournaments all
[9470.84 --> 9473.32]  the time just because that part of it was so much fun.
[9473.80 --> 9476.32]  I did a Minecraft tournament one time.
[9477.08 --> 9479.34]  I'm pretty sure I had never even played Minecraft before.
[9479.34 --> 9483.46]  I remember one of the tournament people was, like, do you even know, like, what you're
[9483.46 --> 9483.68]  doing?
[9483.70 --> 9484.30]  And I was, like, no.
[9485.36 --> 9488.02]  But I just, I was, like, maybe I can figure it out.
[9488.40 --> 9489.76]  Yeah, maybe in that situation.
[9489.90 --> 9491.22]  I was, like, maybe I can figure it out.
[9491.30 --> 9494.50]  Oftentimes I could do pretty okay in games with no, like, actual real practice.
[9494.56 --> 9495.18]  Someone said how.
[9495.44 --> 9495.88]  I don't remember.
[9495.94 --> 9500.22]  You had to, like, get wheat or something and do some other things.
[9500.32 --> 9502.62]  It was, like, you had to finish a certain list of tasks.
[9504.14 --> 9505.36]  And I didn't come in last.
[9505.54 --> 9506.62]  But still.
[9506.62 --> 9509.28]  I don't know.
[9509.38 --> 9511.98]  There's these, like, steps involved.
[9512.98 --> 9519.36]  When you make things too easy, you very often lose the fun.
[9519.66 --> 9520.86]  You lose the quality dopamine.
[9521.32 --> 9523.84]  There's this whole concept of type 2 fun.
[9524.30 --> 9526.64]  And that, I think, is, like, almost too extreme.
[9527.06 --> 9530.82]  I think sometimes just it can still be easy fun.
[9530.92 --> 9534.10]  But if you make it too easy, you just lose all the quality.
[9535.20 --> 9535.32]  Yeah.
[9535.32 --> 9538.72]  Anything worth doing is work.
[9539.64 --> 9540.44]  Yeah, pretty much.
[9540.88 --> 9544.16]  So, man, it's the team balance that I want to figure out.
[9544.74 --> 9551.96]  Because I don't want to have, like, if we're doing the whole teams facing each other setup, right?
[9552.38 --> 9554.08]  It's really hard to do team balance.
[9554.28 --> 9556.02]  It's like, okay, yeah, can you guys switch teams?
[9556.32 --> 9560.18]  And it involves, like, unplugging and moving.
[9560.18 --> 9561.80]  Not necessarily unplugging.
[9562.06 --> 9564.04]  So, I hear what you're saying.
[9564.24 --> 9566.44]  And for our events, it might have to be unplugging.
[9566.62 --> 9570.16]  But at PAX, they had computers there already.
[9571.44 --> 9572.70]  They had setups there already.
[9573.02 --> 9576.76]  That was Intel LAN fest or whatever, though.
[9577.42 --> 9577.82]  Yeah.
[9577.82 --> 9580.06]  So, it might not be super possible.
[9581.58 --> 9583.44]  But that was pretty sick.
[9584.40 --> 9586.32]  I mean, I think there's some pretty cool ways.
[9588.14 --> 9588.80]  I don't know.
[9588.92 --> 9591.34]  I think there's some pretty cool ways you could make it a spectacle, too.
[9592.06 --> 9596.56]  We could also just build computers and just have standardized setups for it.
[9596.70 --> 9600.28]  That way, we wouldn't have to deal with, like, connectivity issues or whatever else.
[9600.30 --> 9604.08]  It would just all already be set up for the games that we really want to do that for.
[9604.78 --> 9606.38]  I might just not even bring a computer.
[9606.52 --> 9607.70]  I might just hang out there the whole time.
[9612.26 --> 9614.20]  You're involved in every tournament game?
[9614.40 --> 9616.02]  You're just, like, one of the players, no matter what?
[9616.38 --> 9617.62]  Oh, it wouldn't be for tournaments.
[9617.62 --> 9621.62]  It would just be for, like, head-to-head games.
[9622.36 --> 9623.80]  It's not necessarily for tournaments.
[9623.80 --> 9625.10]  Which is so sick, to be honest.
[9625.26 --> 9625.94]  Like, this is...
[9625.94 --> 9627.00]  Yeah, I don't know.
[9627.18 --> 9628.40]  It's practically the whole point of the LAN.
[9628.42 --> 9631.50]  The lower the stakes, like, the harder I'll fight.
[9631.56 --> 9632.42]  It's almost more fun.
[9632.54 --> 9633.32]  Yeah, who cares?
[9633.56 --> 9634.36]  It doesn't even matter.
[9634.70 --> 9634.90]  Yeah.
[9635.08 --> 9638.94]  A lot of the best LAN games are games that people don't play all the time.
[9639.22 --> 9639.66]  It's...
[9639.66 --> 9640.14]  Yeah.
[9640.86 --> 9641.04]  Yeah.
[9641.42 --> 9643.48]  Like, there isn't very many.
[9643.58 --> 9647.32]  There were some, but there weren't very many tournaments where they were games that I
[9647.32 --> 9649.54]  actually played that I had a ton of fun with.
[9650.48 --> 9650.84]  Yeah.
[9651.00 --> 9652.96]  It was mostly games that I didn't really play.
[9653.16 --> 9655.28]  But most other people didn't really play either.
[9655.56 --> 9656.36]  So, that made it cool.
[9656.36 --> 9659.72]  We gotta try to do that RTS FPS one for you.
[9660.90 --> 9661.30]  Yeah.
[9663.34 --> 9665.42]  Like, we gotta just do it.
[9666.26 --> 9669.24]  We gotta just, like, draw a line down the middle of the facility and go, okay.
[9670.02 --> 9670.62]  Let's go.
[9670.62 --> 9673.50]  It's so old now.
[9673.76 --> 9675.38]  But I would love to do it.
[9676.44 --> 9677.22]  It would be sweet.
[9678.36 --> 9679.16]  Um, alright.
[9679.22 --> 9679.88]  What else we got?
[9680.06 --> 9680.24]  Oh!
[9680.38 --> 9683.88]  LMG community member fixes corrupted WAN VODs.
[9683.88 --> 9684.08]  Yeah!
[9684.46 --> 9692.34]  User ballboy1321 posted on the LTT subreddit that they managed to save roughly 95% of those
[9692.34 --> 9695.04]  corrupted WAN shows between 2012 and 2015.
[9695.04 --> 9702.12]  To give some context, these files became corrupted due to YouTube retroactively re-encoding older
[9702.12 --> 9703.52]  VODs across the platform.
[9703.94 --> 9708.44]  They've made a YouTube channel, LTT Archive, which has most of the recovered videos up right
[9708.44 --> 9710.74]  now if you'd like to go watch Young, Luke, and Linus.
[9711.40 --> 9718.74]  But, recently, YouTube has also been testing DRM on their videos as an attempt to circumvent
[9718.74 --> 9723.96]  the downloading of YouTube videos, meaning something like this might not be possible in the future.
[9723.96 --> 9729.46]  So far, the videos that have seen this happen have had this DRM forced upon those videos,
[9729.54 --> 9732.24]  including some videos that are licensed as creative commons.
[9733.04 --> 9737.06]  So, our discussion question here is, are we going to sue the hell out of this guy for
[9737.06 --> 9738.06]  re-uploading our content?
[9738.30 --> 9738.48]  Yeah!
[9739.00 --> 9740.46]  Um, no.
[9740.66 --> 9740.98]  No.
[9741.24 --> 9746.96]  What we would do is we would just say, hey, if it's monetized, that's our content, and,
[9747.18 --> 9750.06]  you know, we should probably get the monetization for it.
[9750.06 --> 9757.70]  Um, however, in this case, um, my, this is not a decision that I would make on my own
[9757.70 --> 9758.06]  anymore.
[9758.18 --> 9759.20]  I want to make that very clear.
[9759.42 --> 9765.74]  But my inclination would be to just fully leave it alone, just because it was transformative
[9765.74 --> 9773.06]  in a sense, in that it re-transformed back to the original state after the platform that
[9773.06 --> 9774.30]  we were on ruined it.
[9774.30 --> 9779.94]  And it's not like we were going to make a ton of money from these anyway, so, um, for
[9779.94 --> 9781.18]  the time being.
[9781.98 --> 9782.72]  Oh, hey, look at that.
[9782.82 --> 9783.06]  Okay.
[9783.20 --> 9783.70]  What's up, Pugboy?
[9784.60 --> 9788.34]  Um, but this is not a decision that I would make on my own.
[9788.42 --> 9793.14]  It is technically our IP, and I don't know what our IP, not RIP, RIP in pieces.
[9793.14 --> 9797.44]  Uh, it's technically our IP, and I don't know what the implications are if we don't
[9797.44 --> 9798.78]  actively protect it.
[9798.78 --> 9802.24]  Um, I know that with trademarks, for instance, that can be a problem.
[9802.24 --> 9803.44]  So, I don't know.
[9803.56 --> 9807.26]  I'm not giving a final answer on that right now, but my inclination is to leave it alone.
[9808.40 --> 9816.38]  Um, and then our other discussion question is, if YouTube forces DRM, like forces encryption
[9816.38 --> 9820.08]  on media uploaded to the site, who owns it now that it's uploaded?
[9820.22 --> 9825.36]  I think YouTube's been pretty clear for a long time that they, uh, own the rights for
[9825.36 --> 9832.22]  it, it will still be your content, but it will be basically, um, binary.
[9832.48 --> 9836.50]  You know, you either upload it to the site, and it's available on the site, or you delete
[9836.50 --> 9838.80]  it from the site, and, and that's, and that's it.
[9838.94 --> 9843.90]  In a way, um, I could actually see rights holders preferring this system, because then
[9843.90 --> 9851.08]  nobody else can theoretically download the content and, um, re-upload it somewhere else.
[9851.08 --> 9857.00]  So, it does give you, the owner of that content, the ability to control where it is uploaded
[9857.00 --> 9863.96]  to, theoretically, but I sincerely doubt that this encryption will remain unbroken for any
[9863.96 --> 9866.08]  meaningful amount of time.
[9869.44 --> 9874.98]  I found a, one of the archives that was recovered, um, or restored.
[9875.44 --> 9876.26]  I'll go with that.
[9876.36 --> 9876.64]  Let's see.
[9876.64 --> 9882.08]  Um, oh yeah, you and Rich.
[9882.70 --> 9883.46]  Both wearing.
[9883.66 --> 9884.38]  Sponsored by Razor comms.
[9884.44 --> 9887.74]  Both wearing, yeah, the sponsored by Razor comms was a crazy throwback.
[9888.74 --> 9892.26]  Rich being on the channel was a bit of a throwback, hasn't been on here a long time.
[9892.36 --> 9896.02]  And then we're both wearing, like, StarCraft fanboy shirts.
[9897.04 --> 9898.70]  And then look at the title.
[9900.84 --> 9903.00]  Uh, I can't even see it in my preview.
[9903.18 --> 9903.74]  It's too small.
[9903.74 --> 9907.86]  Uh, it's probably late enough in the video, I can just say it.
[9908.12 --> 9908.54]  League of Legends.
[9908.76 --> 9909.46]  Oh my god.
[9915.04 --> 9916.06]  Oh, okay.
[9918.14 --> 9919.06]  Oh man.
[9919.72 --> 9920.20]  Um.
[9921.50 --> 9922.22]  Good times.
[9922.38 --> 9922.82]  Good era.
[9923.08 --> 9923.44]  2013.
[9923.80 --> 9924.46]  Good stuff.
[9925.78 --> 9928.40]  Charge Nuclei says, encryption can never be broken.
[9929.12 --> 9930.84]  Um, no, but it can be leaked.
[9930.84 --> 9932.32]  It can be broken.
[9932.32 --> 9934.52]  And if it isn't broken, it can be leaked.
[9934.76 --> 9935.84]  Yeah, what is that statement?
[9935.84 --> 9942.20]  Because this is video that will have to be played back online, the keys will have to be
[9942.20 --> 9943.28]  owned by someone.
[9944.00 --> 9945.78]  And so, yeah, at some point.
[9946.28 --> 9947.94]  Um, yeah.
[9949.42 --> 9951.04]  Encryption can never be broken?
[9951.96 --> 9955.48]  I think they might have been slash-sing, but just didn't slash-s.
[9955.54 --> 9958.04]  I just wanted to get out there ahead of that, though.
[9958.42 --> 9958.82]  Okay.
[9959.74 --> 9960.16]  I see.
[9963.16 --> 9963.52]  Um.
[9964.74 --> 9967.74]  Why isn't my Chromecast working?
[9968.64 --> 9973.38]  So, you hoarded Chromecast audios to sell on eBay, since there's still no alternative on
[9973.38 --> 9973.94]  the market for this price.
[9973.94 --> 9974.66]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[9974.72 --> 9975.58]  One second, one second, one second.
[9977.48 --> 9978.88]  Have you ever found this jacket?
[9980.26 --> 9980.62]  No.
[9981.20 --> 9981.48]  Oh.
[9981.52 --> 9982.38]  I never found it again.
[9982.58 --> 9983.42]  I loved that jacket.
[9984.34 --> 9984.66]  No.
[9986.10 --> 9987.26]  I don't know what happened to it.
[9987.34 --> 9988.08]  Sorry, keep going.
[9988.08 --> 9992.96]  Um, so, you hoarded Chromecast audios to sell on eBay, blah, blah, blah, etc.
[9993.16 --> 9994.68]  But is your investment compromised?
[9995.26 --> 10000.22]  Because suddenly, Chromecast Gen 2 and Chromecast audio devices weren't working this week.
[10000.54 --> 10002.60]  Even poor James from our team was affected.
[10003.00 --> 10006.04]  He had to chop his veggies in silence.
[10007.00 --> 10011.46]  Google became aware of the issue on Monday, identified the cause on Tuesday, and by today
[10011.46 --> 10013.26]  had started rolling out updates to devices.
[10013.26 --> 10017.58]  You can force the update by unplugging and plugging back in.
[10018.34 --> 10021.52]  Our discussion question is, when will you children learn that owning things and storing
[10021.52 --> 10022.78]  locally is the only way?
[10023.48 --> 10025.40]  Yeah, it's just not the convenient way.
[10025.40 --> 10031.50]  Um, Warner Brothers DVDs are apparently rotting, but Warner Bros. has acknowledged the problem
[10031.50 --> 10034.00]  and is working with consumers to replace defective discs.
[10034.40 --> 10038.38]  Although, in some cases, the affected titles are no longer in print or the rights have expired,
[10038.78 --> 10044.60]  and in those cases, Warner is offering to exchange the defective discs for other titles of like value.
[10044.60 --> 10050.28]  Discussion question, how would you like to trade that busted old copy of Casablanca for a shiny new
[10050.28 --> 10051.34]  Ernest Goes to Camp?
[10051.84 --> 10053.30]  That's about all I have to say about that.
[10053.36 --> 10054.42]  That was a rapid-fire topic.
[10055.04 --> 10060.72]  And then our last major discussion topic, I think, is, um,
[10061.94 --> 10068.70]  after Jeep's in-car ads glitch, Indian company Mahindra shows ads on the dashboard screen.
[10068.70 --> 10075.86]  Back in February, the Autopian reported on Jeep vehicles displaying a full-screen ad for FlexCare
[10075.86 --> 10079.86]  extended care premium plans appearing on some owners' infotainment systems.
[10080.00 --> 10083.66]  They posted a couple of Reddit links from r slash a-hole design with screenshots.
[10084.50 --> 10085.56]  Do you want to show the screenshots, Luke?
[10086.22 --> 10086.56]  Sure.
[10086.98 --> 10090.42]  One of the posters noted that the message appears every time the car stops,
[10090.60 --> 10091.86]  even if they hit the OK button.
[10092.78 --> 10097.18]  Eventually, Stellantis responded to inquiries with this official statement.
[10097.18 --> 10102.36]  This was an in-vehicle message designed to inform Jeep customers about Mopar extended vehicle care
[10102.36 --> 10102.70]  options.
[10103.06 --> 10108.32]  A temporary software glitch affected the ability to instantly opt out in a few isolated cases,
[10108.68 --> 10112.02]  though instant opt-out is the standard for all of our in-vehicle messages.
[10112.56 --> 10116.26]  Our team had already identified and corrected the error, and we are following up directly with
[10116.26 --> 10118.28]  the customer to ensure the matter is fully resolved.
[10120.06 --> 10124.86]  With that said, ads being shown on car touchscreens has been a concern for a while.
[10124.86 --> 10130.74]  Rush Lane reported back in November of 2021 that Indian manufacturer Mahindra had an option
[10130.74 --> 10133.14]  for advertisements in their XUV700.
[10133.86 --> 10138.58]  And if you fast forward to present day, a Redditor, Spartan underscore Creed YT, has posted
[10138.58 --> 10143.80]  a picture on r slash Cars India showing their infotainment with an advertisement for Scotch
[10143.80 --> 10150.14]  Bright with an Amazon Echo Dot saying, A-L-E-X-A, give me cleaning tips, and the Scotch
[10150.14 --> 10151.50]  Bright logo beside it.
[10151.90 --> 10153.22]  Luke, do you want to show that Reddit post?
[10153.22 --> 10154.22]  Yeah.
[10156.68 --> 10165.18]  I use Waze in my minivan where I don't have Android Auto, and when I stop, sometimes it
[10165.18 --> 10165.98]  pops up ads.
[10166.52 --> 10174.82]  It is ridiculously distracting because the human eye, we're predators, the human eye is attracted
[10174.82 --> 10176.04]  to sudden movement.
[10176.28 --> 10176.84]  Change, yeah.
[10176.84 --> 10177.26]  And they know that.
[10177.26 --> 10182.38]  So when they pop up a thing, it is absolutely designed to draw your eye.
[10182.92 --> 10189.36]  And while my phone on its little windshield mount is not that far off of where I'm supposed
[10189.36 --> 10195.14]  to be looking, and it does pop up only when I am not moving, it absolutely draws my eyes
[10195.14 --> 10197.22]  away from the road.
[10197.22 --> 10199.44]  I hate it.
[10202.32 --> 10203.80]  I would like this to be illegal.
[10204.18 --> 10205.48]  This is one of those cases where...
[10205.48 --> 10205.70]  Tell me too.
[10206.26 --> 10206.80]  I think it should be.
[10206.88 --> 10213.12]  This is one of those cases where being just militantly anti-regulation is just actually
[10213.12 --> 10213.60]  stupid.
[10213.60 --> 10219.64]  Because if we have no regulation, this is what we get.
[10221.78 --> 10226.52]  Laws exist in many cases for a reason.
[10230.70 --> 10236.20]  I'm not saying that every regulation is good or that we have the right amount right now.
[10236.20 --> 10243.50]  I'm just saying that if you are just 100% opposed to any regulation, you've actually not thought
[10243.50 --> 10244.12]  about it enough.
[10244.88 --> 10244.98]  Yeah.
[10246.60 --> 10247.20]  I have...
[10248.72 --> 10254.74]  You know, I'm not super knowledgeable about cars, but I've thought about it enough and
[10254.74 --> 10257.58]  I'm relatively certain it's just a battery and it'll be fine.
[10257.84 --> 10259.56]  But my car didn't start today.
[10261.50 --> 10263.22]  Oh no, are you going to need a new car?
[10263.46 --> 10264.52]  No, I think it's just battery.
[10265.10 --> 10266.08]  I'm pretty sure it's just battery.
[10266.20 --> 10266.84]  I did.
[10266.94 --> 10268.38]  I was like...
[10268.38 --> 10270.72]  My gut reaction was like, no way, it's just battery.
[10270.76 --> 10271.68]  I just put in a new battery.
[10271.84 --> 10272.46]  And then I thought about it.
[10272.46 --> 10274.94]  I was like, I put in a new battery at the start of COVID.
[10275.20 --> 10277.20]  I did not just put in a new battery.
[10277.58 --> 10278.60]  It's been a while.
[10279.40 --> 10281.06]  I think it's fine.
[10281.16 --> 10281.94]  It might be the battery.
[10282.14 --> 10283.48]  Let's check it after the show.
[10284.50 --> 10285.58]  Oh, it's not here.
[10286.20 --> 10287.82]  Oh, your car like did not start.
[10287.98 --> 10288.24]  Yeah.
[10288.66 --> 10288.98]  Oh.
[10289.62 --> 10291.22]  You didn't jump it and then came to work.
[10291.74 --> 10292.96]  Well, yeah, no one was there.
[10293.58 --> 10293.98]  I would have.
[10294.32 --> 10294.82]  Nobody was there.
[10294.82 --> 10296.28]  I had to take an Uber.
[10296.78 --> 10297.58]  Do you want a ride home?
[10297.92 --> 10298.60]  I might be down.
[10298.74 --> 10299.24]  That'd be sweet.
[10299.46 --> 10299.80]  Thank you.
[10301.24 --> 10302.48]  I'm also sick though.
[10302.70 --> 10303.72]  So I don't know.
[10304.28 --> 10305.26]  Maybe I'll see this in the trunk.
[10305.46 --> 10305.76]  Yeah.
[10305.90 --> 10306.14]  Cool.
[10306.36 --> 10306.74]  Perfect.
[10307.14 --> 10307.54]  I'm down.
[10307.78 --> 10314.26]  I saw someone posting in chat about the apparently Google timeline has been deleting people's
[10314.26 --> 10317.00]  histories even after agreeing to the new terms back in December.
[10317.00 --> 10318.12]  So I was checking mine.
[10318.58 --> 10319.38]  Mine's still here.
[10319.38 --> 10324.76]  I actually care an irrational amount about my Google timeline.
[10325.16 --> 10332.26]  It's like, you know, a history of all the places that I've gone, which is a few places
[10332.26 --> 10333.20]  over the years.
[10333.20 --> 10334.90]  Um.
[10336.70 --> 10340.08]  And it has like all of my like work trips and stuff.
[10340.48 --> 10340.94]  Um.
[10341.06 --> 10344.44]  I'd be, I'd be super not stoked if my timeline was deleted.
[10344.56 --> 10346.94]  I still, I still have it.
[10349.48 --> 10349.92]  Um.
[10349.92 --> 10349.98]  Um.
[10351.20 --> 10353.62]  But yeah, apparently some of them have been getting deleted.
[10355.70 --> 10356.46]  That's a bummer.
[10357.04 --> 10361.32]  Cause it's like, it's kind of my like journal in a way.
[10362.68 --> 10365.44]  Andrew Candy says, yep, my timeline history is completely gone.
[10365.50 --> 10365.94]  I'm pissed.
[10366.66 --> 10368.04]  Yeah, I don't, I don't blame you.
[10369.42 --> 10369.78]  Uh.
[10370.08 --> 10371.72]  Hessler says, same here.
[10371.76 --> 10373.06]  I started doing this self-hosted.
[10373.06 --> 10373.84]  Yeah, okay.
[10374.62 --> 10378.74]  Apparently you can use Google Takeout to get it as an export and then import it back in.
[10378.74 --> 10380.04]  Oh, that is so annoying.
[10380.56 --> 10383.92]  How much, oh man, how much work was it for them to hold on to this?
[10385.20 --> 10385.82]  Like really?
[10393.16 --> 10394.20]  That blows.
[10400.98 --> 10402.28]  Sort by most visited.
[10402.40 --> 10403.94]  What are the places I go to most?
[10404.88 --> 10405.24]  Shopping.
[10405.46 --> 10406.54]  Then food and drink.
[10406.86 --> 10407.54]  Then hotels.
[10407.78 --> 10408.36]  Then attractions.
[10408.36 --> 10409.30]  Then sports.
[10409.48 --> 10410.06]  Then culture.
[10410.22 --> 10410.86]  Then airports.
[10411.38 --> 10412.38]  Yeah, a lot of airports.
[10416.32 --> 10416.94]  Let's see.
[10417.26 --> 10418.62]  How do I even find this?
[10420.18 --> 10420.54]  Timeline?
[10420.78 --> 10421.00]  Yeah.
[10421.50 --> 10421.98]  Is it in Maps?
[10422.02 --> 10423.24]  Oh, you go to Google Maps.
[10423.42 --> 10423.58]  Yeah.
[10424.26 --> 10426.46]  And then you click on your profile picture.
[10426.76 --> 10426.98]  Okay.
[10427.18 --> 10428.20]  And then you go to your timeline.
[10428.38 --> 10428.54]  There it is.
[10429.08 --> 10429.60]  I've done it before.
[10429.70 --> 10430.26]  I just didn't remember.
[10430.44 --> 10430.72]  Okay.
[10431.32 --> 10433.06]  Where is your, how do I find my ranking thing?
[10435.88 --> 10436.24]  Insights?
[10436.24 --> 10439.02]  I think I had it under places.
[10439.52 --> 10440.00]  Places?
[10441.06 --> 10441.32]  Yeah.
[10443.32 --> 10444.08]  Oh, man.
[10444.86 --> 10447.58]  I've apparently visited 185 cities.
[10447.72 --> 10448.42]  That's crazy.
[10449.06 --> 10451.56]  That is, that is pretty nuts.
[10451.56 --> 10462.80]  Remember too, though, that like, you know, San Jose and Santa Clara and Sunnyvale all count
[10462.80 --> 10463.36]  as cities.
[10463.86 --> 10464.10]  Yeah.
[10464.30 --> 10467.02]  Surrey and Richmond and Vancouver are technically cities.
[10467.02 --> 10467.76]  Like, yeah, sure.
[10467.84 --> 10468.04]  Whatever.
[10468.54 --> 10468.74]  Yeah.
[10468.74 --> 10474.22]  Mine is shopping, food and drink, airport, sports, culture, hotels, attractions, in that
[10474.22 --> 10474.44]  order.
[10475.84 --> 10476.66]  A lot of airports.
[10476.84 --> 10477.78]  You're an airport king then.
[10478.16 --> 10478.48]  Yeah.
[10480.46 --> 10482.00]  When the heck was I ever in Calgary?
[10482.08 --> 10483.20]  That must have just been a layover.
[10485.02 --> 10485.96]  Seven years ago.
[10486.62 --> 10486.92]  Yeah.
[10487.28 --> 10492.44]  I've been to Calgary International Airport, a Shell gas station, and White Spot.
[10492.62 --> 10493.30]  Oh, that's right.
[10493.30 --> 10495.76]  That was from, um, the Banff workcation.
[10496.32 --> 10497.30]  I have been to Calgary.
[10498.76 --> 10499.46]  All right.
[10500.66 --> 10501.88]  Why is Banff not on here?
[10502.32 --> 10503.82]  Well, okay.
[10504.44 --> 10505.28]  Good try, everyone.
[10505.68 --> 10507.52]  MVP said invest in a jumper pack.
[10507.62 --> 10508.58]  Saved my butt several times.
[10508.72 --> 10511.36]  Honestly, man, I've thought about it.
[10511.70 --> 10512.96]  Like, so many times.
[10513.02 --> 10515.30]  I just never pulled the trigger, which...
[10515.82 --> 10516.46]  Jumper pack?
[10516.92 --> 10517.22]  Yeah.
[10517.32 --> 10518.90]  You can jump yourself, basically.
[10520.06 --> 10521.10]  Oh, oh, oh.
[10521.10 --> 10521.28]  For the car.
[10521.28 --> 10522.88]  Yeah, I have one in my garage.
[10523.04 --> 10524.80]  I don't keep it in my car because I'm an idiot.
[10525.18 --> 10525.44]  Yeah.
[10525.62 --> 10527.44]  Like, I'm clear...
[10527.44 --> 10533.92]  When I get a new battery this time, I will clearly just also get one of those.
[10534.08 --> 10535.30]  Like, I've been aware of it.
[10535.36 --> 10535.76]  I just...
[10535.76 --> 10537.64]  I don't know why I haven't pulled the trigger on that.
[10537.82 --> 10538.40]  I'll figure it out.
[10539.86 --> 10543.68]  There's clearly a few actual, like, hey, I work in a shop car people.
[10544.14 --> 10546.46]  I've already gotten a good recommendation on a battery.
[10546.76 --> 10549.36]  Does someone have a good recommendation on a jumper pack?
[10549.36 --> 10551.36]  Like, can I just...
[10551.36 --> 10552.94]  I'm doing that thing from earlier, right?
[10553.06 --> 10553.60]  I'm not.
[10553.70 --> 10554.10]  I'm not.
[10554.32 --> 10555.58]  I like car stuff.
[10555.66 --> 10557.52]  I watch some car YouTube stuff, but I don't...
[10557.52 --> 10559.10]  I'm not highly knowledgeable of it.
[10561.00 --> 10561.16]  Really?
[10561.20 --> 10561.88]  Won't they cost money?
[10562.00 --> 10562.30]  Yes.
[10562.42 --> 10565.24]  But see, this...
[10565.24 --> 10568.34]  It can also save money because I had to get an Uber to get to work today.
[10568.76 --> 10569.72]  And that sucked.
[10569.94 --> 10570.78]  That was a...
[10570.78 --> 10571.36]  That was a...
[10571.90 --> 10574.00]  I did not like that expensive money.
[10574.00 --> 10579.86]  Whereas a jumper pack can bail me out of bad situations and save me money on Ubers.
[10580.36 --> 10580.80]  Uh-huh.
[10582.34 --> 10585.02]  Our final topic, Apple's at it again.
[10585.18 --> 10590.72]  They have delayed some of their AI-powered personalized Siri features until later this year,
[10591.14 --> 10592.64]  some reports say indefinitely.
[10592.92 --> 10597.32]  And some people within Apple's AI division have reportedly said the features might get cancelled outright.
[10597.32 --> 10603.86]  Apple has pulled the Bella Ramsey video advertising the feature and added a disclaimer to the iPhone product pages.
[10604.44 --> 10607.90]  People are mad and have accused Apple of false advertising.
[10609.72 --> 10611.98]  Our discussion question is, how are you?
[10612.36 --> 10614.48]  I'm proud of you for making it this far on the WAM show, Doc.
[10614.72 --> 10616.00]  I don't really have a discussion question.
[10616.22 --> 10617.46]  I just hope you're having fun.
[10618.68 --> 10619.24]  Love it.
[10619.32 --> 10619.88]  Thank you for that.
[10621.06 --> 10622.12]  Here's my question.
[10622.12 --> 10631.36]  Yes, we should be mad at Apple for advertising features that they are delivering late or won't deliver at all.
[10632.66 --> 10633.28]  Who? Tesla?
[10633.46 --> 10643.14]  But when we think about the amount of money involved, where is this outrage from the Tesla user base?
[10647.08 --> 10647.98]  Seriously, though.
[10649.72 --> 10650.56]  Almost got him.
[10652.12 --> 10656.00]  I thought you were just hard ignoring me.
[10656.70 --> 10658.56]  Because you were like, no, I won't be baited.
[10658.66 --> 10659.96]  And then you just dove in.
[10660.46 --> 10660.64]  Oh.
[10661.86 --> 10662.26]  Like.
[10662.38 --> 10662.60]  Wow.
[10663.14 --> 10668.12]  It is mind-blowing to me that it is not...
[10668.12 --> 10668.68]  Okay.
[10669.70 --> 10672.46]  Is Tesla speedrunning going out of business right now?
[10673.54 --> 10673.92]  Maybe.
[10674.10 --> 10675.02]  It kind of seems like it.
[10676.06 --> 10677.26]  It kind of seems like it.
[10678.26 --> 10679.02]  Oh, dude.
[10679.02 --> 10682.34]  It's already lost all the gains since the election.
[10682.94 --> 10685.48]  Apparently today it's up almost 4%.
[10685.48 --> 10687.24]  Yeah.
[10687.58 --> 10688.18]  But...
[10688.18 --> 10690.98]  The one month is down 29%.
[10690.98 --> 10694.26]  Even a dead cat bounces if you throw it at the floor hard enough.
[10694.44 --> 10696.00]  I noticed this a few days ago.
[10696.08 --> 10696.28]  Okay.
[10696.40 --> 10698.20]  So the scales are nuts.
[10698.28 --> 10699.86]  And like, I am not investment boy.
[10699.98 --> 10702.20]  So I'm sure people are going to be like, me, you don't know stuff.
[10702.28 --> 10703.02]  And that's 100%.
[10703.54 --> 10704.00]  You're right.
[10704.10 --> 10704.56]  I don't.
[10704.56 --> 10706.08]  But look at this.
[10706.08 --> 10706.80]  One day.
[10706.94 --> 10707.10]  Okay.
[10707.10 --> 10708.48]  It's up almost 4%.
[10708.48 --> 10709.16]  Five days.
[10709.46 --> 10709.70]  Yeah.
[10709.96 --> 10711.58]  It's down 1%.
[10711.58 --> 10712.22]  One month.
[10712.30 --> 10714.14]  It's down 29.5%.
[10714.14 --> 10715.30]  Six months.
[10715.74 --> 10716.10]  It...
[10716.10 --> 10716.92]  It's...
[10716.92 --> 10717.90]  It's up.
[10718.26 --> 10719.00]  10%.
[10719.00 --> 10719.94]  Year to date.
[10720.20 --> 10720.66]  Down.
[10722.66 --> 10723.66]  One year.
[10723.82 --> 10724.56]  Way up.
[10725.20 --> 10726.08]  Five years way up.
[10726.16 --> 10726.98]  That's kind of obvious.
[10727.48 --> 10728.16]  But it's just like...
[10728.16 --> 10728.34]  Yeah.
[10728.34 --> 10728.90]  Whoa.
[10729.08 --> 10738.40]  The fact that it is up 10% from six months ago is interesting to me.
[10739.02 --> 10742.62]  Did you see the Tesla commercial on the front lawn of the White House?
[10742.72 --> 10743.50]  I sure did.
[10743.90 --> 10744.66]  The whole...
[10744.66 --> 10745.96]  It's all computer.
[10747.30 --> 10748.10]  It's all computer.
[10748.40 --> 10749.26]  It's just all computer.
[10750.16 --> 10754.52]  Shraf 2K says Linus gets full credit for being an early Elon hate adopter.
[10755.14 --> 10756.28]  I don't hate him.
[10756.28 --> 10761.46]  What I don't like is that he lies and misleads.
[10762.28 --> 10770.46]  I don't like that he obviously thinks that he should not have to answer difficult questions
[10770.46 --> 10777.04]  when it comes to the safety of the vehicles or when it comes to reporters investigating
[10777.04 --> 10779.82]  their quality or whatever the case may be.
[10779.82 --> 10789.22]  He thinks it is amusing to reply with a poop emoji to real questions that deserve answers.
[10789.70 --> 10792.42]  These are things that reveal his character.
[10793.44 --> 10797.82]  I don't respect those aspects of his character.
[10797.92 --> 10798.66]  I don't hate him.
[10798.66 --> 10802.62]  I literally bought a Model Y for my in-laws because they wanted one.
[10803.26 --> 10807.58]  I have voted with my wallet that if the product is good enough, clearly I'll buy it.
[10808.00 --> 10814.26]  But what I have said for years and years and years is that he has revealed his character.
[10814.64 --> 10818.48]  His character is that he thinks he is beyond being questioned.
[10818.48 --> 10824.16]  His character is that he doesn't believe in the value of worker protections.
[10825.74 --> 10831.68]  His character is that he believes that he can just say something and not be held to account for it.
[10831.86 --> 10832.78]  That's his character.
[10833.38 --> 10834.64]  We wouldn't be friends.
[10834.64 --> 10836.64]  He doesn't believe in the value of worker protections.
[10836.64 --> 10837.40]  I don't hate him.
[10839.82 --> 10847.56]  It's also, and I've said this on the show before, it's also clear that, you know what?
[10847.96 --> 10851.24]  I'm not going to repeat my previous statement, but what I'll say is this.
[10851.70 --> 10855.42]  I run one company and I have three children.
[10856.84 --> 10863.70]  That is very difficult to balance while being a quality father to my three children.
[10863.70 --> 10865.26]  With one wife.
[10867.96 --> 10870.54]  What if you had two wife?
[10872.20 --> 10875.36]  What if I had four times as many children?
[10875.80 --> 10887.48]  To imagine for a second that I am quality fathering 12 children across a multitude of wives is laughable.
[10887.62 --> 10892.18]  Because quality being a father is a ton of work.
[10892.18 --> 10898.84]  And that work, you can't just do it intensely for a little bit and then not do it for a while.
[10899.34 --> 10900.18]  It's constant.
[10900.68 --> 10904.08]  And all of the dads out there watching this are going to know that.
[10904.52 --> 10908.54]  And one of the things that I've also talked about is that I think as men,
[10908.74 --> 10913.58]  we are not always choosing our role models extremely wisely these days.
[10913.58 --> 10918.30]  And I think at the time back then, I talked about Musk.
[10918.38 --> 10924.28]  I talked about Jobs, Steve Jobs, as people who achieved a lot of really great stuff,
[10924.28 --> 10935.26]  but who I do not admire for the way that they treated their partners, their baby mamas, and their children.
[10935.26 --> 10938.16]  I do not think that those are admirable qualities.
[10938.44 --> 10942.76]  I don't think that makes you a good man.
[10942.92 --> 10948.02]  I think being a good man means taking care of your progeny and doing it properly.
[10948.52 --> 10950.10]  So I don't respect it.
[10950.26 --> 10952.94]  The great stuff side is legit, right?
[10954.00 --> 10954.44]  Yeah.
[10954.64 --> 10955.88]  You can say he bought Tesla.
[10956.02 --> 10956.74]  He didn't invent it.
[10956.74 --> 10960.48]  You can say he's the world's best Diablo 4 player.
[10961.86 --> 10966.68]  In doing so, he popularized electric cars, which you can see is good or bad.
[10967.08 --> 10969.84]  The stuff with SpaceX is genuinely insane.
[10972.02 --> 10976.58]  The catch was one of the most wild things I've probably ever seen in my entire life.
[10976.84 --> 10979.34]  But then, everything that Linus just said is also legit.
[10979.64 --> 10982.42]  So, it sucks.
[10982.42 --> 10989.98]  One of the things that's been wild for me is the about face that a lot of people do.
[10991.60 --> 10992.66]  Which is interesting.
[10992.94 --> 10994.70]  There's like dramatic changes.
[10995.00 --> 11001.04]  So you can like, you know, watch someone or follow someone or read their stuff or whatever it is.
[11001.12 --> 11001.62]  I don't know.
[11002.12 --> 11004.02]  Watch their ticky-talkies.
[11005.92 --> 11009.40]  And then, you know, in five years, maybe they're a completely different person.
[11009.80 --> 11011.42]  It's like, damn, I don't know.
[11012.42 --> 11015.82]  But he's got to move on.
[11016.60 --> 11016.86]  Who cares?
[11017.04 --> 11018.50]  Man, there's so many examples of this.
[11019.12 --> 11021.46]  Tufanuk in YouTube chats.
[11021.60 --> 11022.82]  Like, who names their son X?
[11023.78 --> 11029.40]  Someone who doesn't respect that that will be an adult person someday.
[11029.72 --> 11033.36]  Who probably wants to have a name that isn't stupid.
[11034.20 --> 11035.24]  And isn't a meme.
[11035.98 --> 11036.24]  You know?
[11036.24 --> 11043.48]  Like, treating kids like property that you could just like meme on is so utterly disrespectful of another human life.
[11046.36 --> 11049.72]  One that you have a responsibility to care for and respect.
[11050.30 --> 11050.76]  Yeah.
[11050.82 --> 11051.64]  It's not cool.
[11051.64 --> 11057.86]  With that said, I'm not saying that...
[11057.86 --> 11059.64]  I think X is actually kind of cool.
[11061.20 --> 11063.54]  Oh, there's another one that has a little, like, stupider one.
[11064.82 --> 11066.98]  Archangel something, something, something.
[11067.92 --> 11068.24]  Whatever.
[11068.46 --> 11069.00]  Which is wild.
[11069.52 --> 11070.18]  Kind of sick.
[11070.18 --> 11073.94]  Laughing Canadian says, entirely unrelated to Musk and his family system.
[11074.12 --> 11075.12]  I think that's one way of putting it.
[11075.50 --> 11077.70]  I dislike couples that have, like, eight plus kids.
[11077.82 --> 11079.10]  There's zero chance that's healthy.
[11079.22 --> 11080.96]  You literally cannot raise that many kids properly.
[11081.08 --> 11083.10]  Actually, I don't necessarily believe that's true.
[11083.18 --> 11084.02]  I was one of five.
[11084.76 --> 11093.72]  And when you're all under one roof, by the time you have an eighth child, your oldest is, like, probably at least 15.
[11093.72 --> 11096.82]  And is contributing in a major way.
[11096.94 --> 11108.02]  And I actually think that a hugely beneficial part of my upbringing experience was being old enough to remember babies.
[11109.06 --> 11117.66]  A huge part of being able to be an effective parent is that I effectively did some of it when I was younger.
[11117.88 --> 11119.84]  I cared for small children.
[11119.84 --> 11124.76]  And obviously there weren't eight of us.
[11124.86 --> 11126.68]  But, you know, we didn't quite need a van.
[11126.98 --> 11128.66]  But we sure as heck filled a minivan.
[11129.44 --> 11138.32]  And there were great, great things that came from the social interactions of living with people.
[11138.64 --> 11142.26]  Not just having a sibling and, like, living with your parents.
[11142.26 --> 11152.30]  But having to get along and having to share and having to, you know, fight for things and learning when to yield.
[11152.30 --> 11160.66]  These were all really important aspects of growing up that I think are actually lost in very small families.
[11160.66 --> 11165.10]  To be clear, I'm not saying having a small family is a wrong choice either.
[11165.22 --> 11175.36]  I'm just saying that condemning someone for having, you know, a very large family because you don't think they can raise the kids properly.
[11175.36 --> 11180.70]  I think overlooks how much raising children will do of each other.
[11180.70 --> 11186.44]  As long as there are sufficient checks and balances in place from the adult mentors and role models.
[11186.54 --> 11188.56]  I'm not talking going full Lord of the Flies here.
[11188.56 --> 11191.08]  Just saying.
[11191.40 --> 11191.86]  Just saying.
[11192.24 --> 11193.54]  Try not to judge.
[11193.70 --> 11194.56]  Try not to judge.
[11194.68 --> 11194.76]  Yeah.
[11194.88 --> 11197.36]  Unless you know the exact situation.
[11197.66 --> 11197.90]  Yeah.
[11202.50 --> 11203.18]  Moving on.
[11204.14 --> 11204.58]  Yeah.
[11206.58 --> 11207.20]  I don't know.
[11207.24 --> 11208.18]  I think that's it for topics.
[11208.18 --> 11209.32]  I was going to say, it's 10.
[11209.50 --> 11211.28]  Are we moving on to merch messages?
[11212.22 --> 11213.14]  Yeah, I guess so.
[11213.18 --> 11214.10]  Is it after dark time?
[11214.54 --> 11215.04]  I think so.
[11215.26 --> 11216.12]  I think it's after dark time.
[11218.56 --> 11220.90]  Oh, yeah.
[11220.90 --> 11223.10]  That one.
[11223.22 --> 11223.46]  Oh, yeah.
[11223.50 --> 11224.88]  I guess my background doesn't change.
[11225.24 --> 11225.90]  Not so dark.
[11229.42 --> 11230.40]  There we go.
[11231.96 --> 11232.38]  All right.
[11232.48 --> 11234.00]  Yeah, I got a few for you here.
[11234.44 --> 11235.82]  Hey, DLL.
[11236.16 --> 11238.66]  I know Linus has the bike paint project.
[11238.80 --> 11240.26]  Dan has the Hayabusa project.
[11240.38 --> 11243.26]  But what is Luke's ongoing side project?
[11243.26 --> 11247.66]  Float plane in the lab?
[11248.32 --> 11248.80]  Yeah.
[11250.50 --> 11251.54]  Second job.
[11251.90 --> 11253.28]  To be honest.
[11253.84 --> 11254.20]  Yeah.
[11254.56 --> 11260.78]  Outside of that, I have enough time to hopefully not be hated by my partner.
[11262.24 --> 11266.20]  Take care of birds, or at least a little bit.
[11266.20 --> 11270.64]  I mean, if she forgets who you are and what you look like and what you sound like, she can't really hate you.
[11271.72 --> 11276.48]  And try to take care of my physical self as much as possible.
[11277.22 --> 11279.70]  But, yeah, I mean, lately it's been a lot of work.
[11280.22 --> 11280.82]  We're hiring.
[11281.02 --> 11281.20]  Hey.
[11282.82 --> 11283.50]  We're hiring.
[11285.26 --> 11285.76]  Let's go.
[11286.02 --> 11286.56]  Help me.
[11286.86 --> 11287.28]  Help me.
[11287.54 --> 11287.80]  Help.
[11289.16 --> 11289.56]  Please.
[11290.36 --> 11290.72]  Yeah.
[11290.90 --> 11291.44]  That's about it.
[11291.44 --> 11294.64]  Hey, Wancho.
[11294.78 --> 11301.38]  With the new Zeus GPU being floated, what are your thoughts on how this will shake up the GPU market if it successfully launches?
[11303.04 --> 11304.32]  I'll believe it when I see it.
[11305.42 --> 11310.16]  I, uh, yeah, I don't, I'm not putting a lot of stock in those claims.
[11310.16 --> 11319.84]  I mean, we saw, um, what's it, Moore Threads, the Chinese GPU company that managed to build a functioning GPU, which was more than I expected.
[11319.84 --> 11322.02]  But, like, come on.
[11322.34 --> 11333.30]  I think it's pretty clear from their efforts and from just what we know, because we just know that, um, that building a GPU and hardware is not a hard part.
[11334.06 --> 11335.66]  Um, look at what Intel did with the Arc.
[11335.76 --> 11337.00]  They built the Arc GPU.
[11337.18 --> 11337.54]  There it is.
[11337.58 --> 11338.28]  It's an Arc GPU.
[11338.28 --> 11349.70]  But even with Intel's literal decades of experience on the software side, it was still an enormous challenge to get that thing over the line and get it performing half decent.
[11349.96 --> 11351.88]  So, yeah, sure, whatever.
[11352.48 --> 11353.28]  Good luck, guys.
[11355.48 --> 11357.12]  Hi, Dan, Luke, and Linus.
[11357.20 --> 11358.04]  Question for Linus.
[11358.16 --> 11360.84]  I have the original carabiners on my backpack.
[11361.52 --> 11362.28]  Not really a question.
[11362.80 --> 11363.80]  Wait for Linus.
[11363.86 --> 11364.42]  Don't interrupt.
[11364.42 --> 11369.26]  Should I go ahead and replace them with, uh, even though they're okay?
[11370.68 --> 11371.76]  It's up to you, man.
[11372.12 --> 11374.98]  Um, you could totally replace them or you could totally not.
[11375.10 --> 11378.32]  I replaced the one on mine that broke, so my backpack looks stupid.
[11378.56 --> 11380.00]  I can't say I would recommend that.
[11380.12 --> 11385.68]  But, uh, it's a, it's a, it's a, I was going to say it's a free country, but I have no idea where you're from.
[11385.78 --> 11387.96]  But, uh, do whatever you want.
[11388.64 --> 11389.46]  It's your backpack.
[11389.46 --> 11397.64]  I, I didn't talk about this a lot because I didn't want to dissuade people from doing it, but I think it's been long enough now that I can talk about it.
[11397.72 --> 11403.68]  I, I use the backpack all the time and I had never had any problems with any of my carabiners.
[11403.92 --> 11414.12]  Um, until you're coming back from Disney and one of the TSA ladies like cranked one of the carabiners for, for no reason.
[11414.12 --> 11417.94]  I, I, I, I don't know, maybe she knew.
[11418.08 --> 11418.96]  No, there's no way.
[11419.06 --> 11423.84]  But, um, just, and like shoved her thumb through it and I was like, what?
[11423.98 --> 11428.58]  And I, I, I kind of like grabbed it and pushed it back and it's fine luckily.
[11428.58 --> 11431.72]  But I, I was like certain it was just going to get snapped right off.
[11432.24 --> 11434.56]  Um, and I, I tested it a bunch of times.
[11434.62 --> 11437.68]  It seems okay, but I think I was lucky more than anything.
[11437.68 --> 11440.26]  It was originally like completely past the post.
[11440.30 --> 11441.78]  Like it was, it was out.
[11441.94 --> 11446.54]  I was just, it was probably one or two millimeters further and it would have been permanently broken.
[11447.04 --> 11453.60]  Um, but yeah, I, outside of that close call, they've all been fine.
[11456.74 --> 11457.62]  Hi Linus.
[11457.72 --> 11463.20]  I recently cleared FF7 for the first time and boy, it is a lot of busted exploits.
[11463.20 --> 11469.16]  Do you have a particular exploit or trick for an older Final Fantasy or other game you like to take advantage of?
[11471.00 --> 11487.22]  Um, I don't actually love taking advantage of exploits because I like to, I like to play the game kind of the way that the, I use the term good faith a lot.
[11487.22 --> 11496.74]  Um, but it's kind of like, uh, it kind of is like a, a catch all term for how I like to engage with things and how I like to be engaged with.
[11497.20 --> 11505.20]  So I like to play a game at least the first time around, you know, obviously it's fun to find broken builds or whatever.
[11505.20 --> 11505.52]  Right.
[11505.78 --> 11513.64]  But I like to play a game the way that the developer kind of intended for it to be played through what they thought was supposed to be fun.
[11514.96 --> 11516.48]  Um, yeah.
[11517.22 --> 11522.48]  So I tend to, I tend to try to not look up too much.
[11523.12 --> 11535.24]  Um, I tend to rely only on like the first party resources that I was supposed to have if I, you know, bought the game and I got the manual or I, I, you know, read through the, the store page and played the tutorial or whatever else.
[11535.24 --> 11540.24]  And I try not to look too hard for things that are completely broken.
[11540.24 --> 11556.46]  But if there was one that I would say would be kind of fun to exploit broken stuff in, I guess it would probably be like Final Fantasy Tactics because it can be pretty, it can be pretty fun to build, you know, God characters that like can't be hit and stuff like that.
[11556.46 --> 11559.14]  But it also, it also takes the challenge out.
[11559.14 --> 11565.56]  Like I like, I like a big part of gaming for me is feeling like I overcame a challenge.
[11566.02 --> 11570.82]  Otherwise, what am I even, what am I even doing here?
[11570.82 --> 11575.96]  Um, I don't mind it as much in like tape to tape.
[11576.08 --> 11583.70]  Uh, Luke, I was telling you I'm saving a run that I'm in the middle of for the next time we can play together because wow, is it ever broken.
[11583.70 --> 11588.08]  But what's cool about that is it's just like this self-contained one hour run.
[11588.70 --> 11594.70]  Whereas like if I'm breaking a game like Final Fantasy Tactics, that's like, you know, 30 plus hours to do a playthrough.
[11595.28 --> 11601.10]  I'm, I'm just, I'm removing the fun challenge that will be the final boss.
[11602.58 --> 11604.16]  And why am I even playing the rest of it?
[11604.18 --> 11606.34]  I should just watch the cut scenes on YouTube, right?
[11606.40 --> 11608.54]  Like it just, it just feels kind of pointless to me.
[11608.54 --> 11616.16]  But I'm not, you know, if someone else is, if someone else enjoys a different element of that game, that's totally, totally for them.
[11616.74 --> 11619.40]  Um, but that it's not what I enjoy.
[11621.48 --> 11622.00]  Yeah.
[11623.82 --> 11624.74]  Hi, DLO.
[11625.02 --> 11635.84]  I apparently made a mistake ordering a 4x24 gigabyte kit of 8,000 megatransfer RAM on my new AM5 board as it can only reach 5,600 megatransfers per second stable.
[11636.36 --> 11637.90]  What's the deal with this generation?
[11637.90 --> 11639.48]  Does everyone just buy two?
[11641.00 --> 11642.70]  Yeah, everyone just buys two sticks.
[11643.46 --> 11644.74]  Um, you're lucky to get 56.
[11644.94 --> 11645.52]  That's pretty good.
[11648.12 --> 11651.86]  My preschool age daughter is getting into gaming and just beat Astro Bot.
[11652.12 --> 11658.08]  Do you have any recommendations for games that, uh, games like that for her to try next that involve problem solving?
[11659.04 --> 11661.42]  I had never even heard of Astro Bot.
[11661.68 --> 11666.48]  It's like the PS5, uh, like launch title?
[11666.48 --> 11669.70]  You're like playing the PlayStation mascot, I think.
[11670.24 --> 11671.02]  It's like Mac.
[11671.20 --> 11672.30]  But people love it.
[11672.78 --> 11673.88]  It's very highly rare.
[11673.88 --> 11674.46]  Oh, interesting.
[11674.68 --> 11676.96]  Wow, five, five stars.
[11677.22 --> 11679.12]  I think it won, like, game of the year or something.
[11679.12 --> 11681.74]  I have no idea.
[11681.88 --> 11682.22]  I mean, if you're...
[11682.22 --> 11683.34]  It's a medical must-play.
[11684.00 --> 11689.34]  If they're playing, like, clearly adult-suitable games...
[11689.34 --> 11691.10]  I don't mean, like, an adult game.
[11691.14 --> 11693.02]  I just mean a game that, like, adults would enjoy.
[11693.14 --> 11695.38]  Well, then they could play, like, any fun platform or game.
[11695.38 --> 11698.86]  And I actually enjoyed the crap out of Lucky's Tale, even though it was just, like, supposed
[11698.86 --> 11701.18]  to be, like, a crappy showcase title, I thought.
[11703.10 --> 11705.40]  You can also give her some retro games.
[11706.72 --> 11708.30]  You know, some old-fashioned Super Mario World.
[11708.48 --> 11711.44]  My kids loved it, in spite of how old it was.
[11713.60 --> 11714.92]  Looking at the game...
[11714.92 --> 11717.54]  I've never played Astro Bot, and maybe I'm just totally wrong here.
[11717.54 --> 11721.96]  But looking at some of the gameplay, like, they might like some of the Lego games?
[11724.64 --> 11725.00]  Mmm.
[11725.20 --> 11726.62]  Ah, I just find them...
[11726.62 --> 11728.00]  Man, are they ever unchallenging.
[11728.02 --> 11729.02]  Really unchallenging.
[11729.02 --> 11729.92]  But I guess for free of preschool, that's fine.
[11730.20 --> 11730.36]  Yeah.
[11730.36 --> 11732.72]  Lego's apparently bringing their game development in-house.
[11733.28 --> 11738.22]  Even if it, like, hurts profit, I guess they want to control the quality a little bit.
[11738.46 --> 11741.56]  I've only tried a couple of them, but they seemed very mediocre.
[11742.48 --> 11742.86]  Yeah.
[11743.10 --> 11746.86]  I tried one, and was like, I guess I'm not interested in any of these.
[11747.54 --> 11751.12]  Which, if it's like a little kid game, sure, maybe, I guess.
[11751.18 --> 11752.72]  But so was Super Mario Bros.
[11753.00 --> 11754.12]  So, I don't know.
[11755.40 --> 11756.50]  Doesn't have to be that way.
[11758.98 --> 11760.76]  And last one I got for you here.
[11760.94 --> 11761.74]  Hey, Riley, how you doing?
[11762.22 --> 11762.92]  Hi, LLD.
[11763.12 --> 11766.70]  I just bought a physical copy of Baldur's Gate 3 from Japan.
[11767.00 --> 11771.72]  Mr. Luke, as a man of culture yourself, do you think the censorship will heavily affect
[11771.72 --> 11773.02]  the experience with the game?
[11774.22 --> 11775.32]  Will I be missing out?
[11776.44 --> 11777.28]  Sorry, which game?
[11777.54 --> 11778.42]  Baldur's Gate 3.
[11778.52 --> 11779.16]  Baldur's Gate 3.
[11779.86 --> 11780.86]  The censorship.
[11781.14 --> 11781.62]  Oh.
[11782.18 --> 11782.98]  As a man of culture?
[11783.26 --> 11783.64]  No.
[11786.46 --> 11788.14]  How censored is the game in Japan?
[11788.34 --> 11789.36]  It's always fun to me.
[11789.72 --> 11796.26]  Japan's, or funny to me, Japan's, like, sort of schizophrenic approach to adult content.
[11796.26 --> 11798.58]  Like, one day they are...
[11798.58 --> 11801.78]  You just gotta put a little line over it.
[11802.58 --> 11807.32]  Yeah, and then the next day it's just like, yeah, this is the most outlandish, like, weirdo
[11807.32 --> 11807.88]  stuff ever.
[11808.04 --> 11809.64]  And it's, man, I don't...
[11809.64 --> 11810.68]  I don't know, man.
[11810.68 --> 11814.28]  Are they just censoring, like, um...
[11814.28 --> 11816.34]  Like, nudie scenes?
[11816.46 --> 11818.26]  Or are they doing, like, gore and violence stuff?
[11818.32 --> 11819.52]  I doubt gore and violence, right?
[11819.62 --> 11820.42]  It's probably just nude.
[11820.82 --> 11822.18]  Yeah, then, I don't know, whatever.
[11823.12 --> 11823.66]  It's fine.
[11825.28 --> 11826.00]  Japan's pro-tentacle anti-human.
[11826.00 --> 11828.00]  I mean, there's a setting in the game...
[11828.00 --> 11828.42]  ...sets for a reason.
[11829.42 --> 11830.52]  ...already to do that.
[11830.60 --> 11832.44]  And, like, I'm sure a lot of people do that.
[11833.08 --> 11835.36]  It's probably just, like, checked on by default.
[11835.36 --> 11837.76]  People streamed the heck out of that game.
[11838.00 --> 11840.22]  They probably had that stuff turned off.
[11840.50 --> 11840.66]  Yeah.
[11843.82 --> 11844.26]  Yeah.
[11844.80 --> 11845.12]  Yeah.
[11845.84 --> 11846.58]  It's fine.
[11846.68 --> 11847.24]  We'll enjoy it.
[11847.32 --> 11848.24]  It's a fantastic game.
[11849.12 --> 11850.72]  Was that it for WAN Show today?
[11851.44 --> 11851.66]  Yeah.
[11852.88 --> 11855.40]  Alright, well, then I guess we'll see you again next week.
[11855.50 --> 11856.68]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[11857.58 --> 11857.98]  Bye!
[11860.76 --> 11863.80]  Someone linked an Escapist magazine article
[11863.80 --> 11865.92]  called We Were Spartans
[11865.92 --> 11868.12]  that was published in 2011
[11868.12 --> 11868.94]  that is, like,
[11869.52 --> 11871.10]  perfectly encapsulates how
[11871.10 --> 11873.80]  online gaming code lands and why not it's bad.
[11875.50 --> 11875.94]  Oh.
[11876.94 --> 11877.72]  It's a good read.
[11877.80 --> 11878.26]  Where is this?
[11879.64 --> 11881.20]  Okay, maybe I text it for me.
[11881.22 --> 11881.78]  I can't see it.
[11881.90 --> 11882.06]  Okay.
[11882.06 --> 11882.12]  Bye!
[11885.64 --> 11886.12]  Bye!
