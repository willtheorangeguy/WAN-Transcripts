Timestamp 38:30 Samsung makes good tablets. I once did a 2 week Samsung dex daily challenge. At school where I just need stuff to work, I tried my Galaxy Tab S6 (an older tablet, I did this last year). It was good. The biggest hurdle was downloading everything I needed, then arranging my desktop. I would have left my phone at home, but Samsung has this dumb thing about not letting you link a Samsung watch to a tablet. Other than that, I could have just brought my tablet and needed nothing else.
